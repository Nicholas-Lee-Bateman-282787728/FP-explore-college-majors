Seriously, this movie is pretty piss-poor by what I expect from an animated movies. This movie is hardly funny by any means and is just flatout stupid as hell. The animal characters are very annoying and why was R&B music included ? The story is a disaster, the plot just pisses me off, and the dialogue is a travesty.

In fact, this computer-animated feature had the least amount of adult humor of any other one I've seen.  The only character that is really funny on their own is Mehlman the Giraffe, voiced by David Schwimmer.  And the only reason he's funny is because his character has a gimmick.  There are a few funny moments throughout, and the pack of lemurs are fairyl entertaining, but there really was no story at all, and the animation wasn't all that great compared to recent features.I'm sure children love this film, but for me it was the same old schtick, different title.",3,Nothing new here,1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,614,"['Madagascar', 'typical', 'children', 'movie', 'fact', 'computer-animated', 'feature', 'had', 'least', 'amount', 'adult', 'humor', 'other', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'only', 'character', 'really', 'funny', 'own', 'Mehlman', 'Giraffe', 'voiced', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'only', 'reason', 'funny', 'character', 'gimmick', 'are', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'pack', 'lemurs', 'are', 'fairyl', 'entertaining', 'there', 'really', 'was', 'story', 'animation', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'compared', 'recent', 'features.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'children', 'love', 'film', 'was', 'same', 'old', 'schtick', 'different', 'title']",Madagascar

I enjoyed that movie until I started being afraid and I was scared of when Alex was Roaring and I was so scared. My mom was I think noticing a little. I got scared the Rest of the movie and after we saw the movie out in a theater,  my mom said, ""You're afraid."" and my mom once told me that if I am afraid, I pray or talk to my parents. I saw it again when I was 11 and I was still scared because of my usual (Roaring) and I didn't get my ears plugged. I got my eyes opened like if it were blurry and after that, I vowed not to watch it again until I get rid of my fear and for the past 2 years after I saw The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, I chose to go back to it and I was 13. While I was watching the movie, I was holding the Lucky Snowman Stick, it helps me get rid of my fear and after I saw the movie, my fear of Roaring is gone.

636206,A3UAMOVHW9PRQ5,B00005JNX0,amanooensis,"[3, 6]","UPDATE - Jan. 2007Well, you never know...A while after that first viewing (described in the review below, from September 2005), this movie came on cable, so I taped it ""just in case."" Well, it feels a bit different on the small screen, and our kid liked it -- although some reassurances were still needed at first to get past worries about the biting, clawing, and so on.By the second or third viewing, we were all enjoying it about equally, and the inherent ""violence"" of the food chain had been accepted because our child was a bit older, and had learned more about science, nature -- the circle of life, so to speak.I still do not think it is appropriate for most kids 5 or under, but now that time has passed, we like this a lot more than we did after that first movie viewing, and we've watched it frequently. One finds a lot of details on repeat viewings that one misses the first time, and there are plenty of jokes that work different ways for adults and kids. By the party music during the final credit roll, we are all dancing!I'm leaving the original review intact, because it was an honest assessment of the film at that time, and a description of a real experience.----------- ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS -----------""Reasonable entertainment one time but not worth owning""I saw this in a theater full of five-year-old kids at a birthday party. If ever there were a setup for a great response to a movie, that would have been it. Well, the movie started, then went on... and on... the kids didn't laugh much and hardly moved except perhaps to squirm in their seats. The movie would get going occasionally, the kids would respond, then the story would drop to low gear again. Yawn.Sure, there were high spots of interest, and our kid particularly liked the King Lemur and his silly song and dance. But none of the main characters made a true, lasting impression on our child, nor were we asked for Madagascar toys afterward. THAT is a real indicator, I think.We have toy lions, giraffes, hippos and zebras -- and when playing, our 5-year-old never reassigns them to play the characters in this film. By contrast, the lion toys are often used to act out ""The Lion King"" for one good example. If Madagascar had really made an impression, we'd have seen it being re-enacted at home. But it never happened.I'm a huge fan of Chris Rock, and I like Ben Stiller. I wanted to see this movie succeed not just because I like those performers, but also because as parents, we can always use another good kid movie for the home collection, to stretch out the repeats of other stuff we've watched a zillion times. But I do not think this one fits the bill.Parents of young kids should note that PG rating. Yes, folks, there really IS a difference between ""G"" and ""PG"" and the PG means your kids are depending on your guidance for what they see. This film is a little rough around the edges with some mildly scary violence, crass jokes and so on. Other reviewers always mention the penguins, but frankly I think most young kids will not get that humor at all. The stuff the penguins do is funny to grownups, but kind of mystifying to little ones.The setup -- the animals wanting to get out of New York -- will also make a lot more sense to older kids and adults than it will to young ones. The ""humor"" revolving around captive animals having to adjust to life in the wild? Kindergartners can understand stuff like that if you talk about it, especially when applied to real animals and so on. But I do not think they can pick up that this problem is a motivating plot force in this movie.The animals are escaping from the zoo, yeah, and that's easy to grasp. But this is not just about escaping. This movie is about four characters learning how to return to a natural existence, and how to keep their relationships intact in the process. If that sounds HEAVY, well, you're right -- it is! I don't think the producers really understood what film they were making, or that the theme described above is too subtle and intellectual a concept to serve as the foundation for an animated comedy.And some kids will probably be a little wigged out by the way Alex, the natural carnivore who never had to hunt when he lived in the zoo, struggles not to turn his friends into a meal as he gradually adjusts to the wild life on Madagascar. In other words, the change in these relationships makes sense to adults, but might confuse and bother a young child.Maybe older kids might dig this more. Maybe not. As for parents who think this is better than Shark's Tale, I totally disagree.For a long time, I tried to avoid letting our kid see Shark's Tale when it came on TV, because I thought it would be too violent and that the humor might be too adult. One night we ended up watching some of it by accident, and our child was fine with it, to my great surprise.All the mafia jokes in Shark's Tale were completely over the head of our five-year-old, of course. But the writing was so ingenious that those scenes still worked great for a kid's film. It had a clearcut, obvious story, with a clearcut, obvious central character, who has a clearcut, obvious plot resolution. And it has physical humor that is carefully paced throughout the film, in ways that keep kids attentive.Madagascar has none of those things. And as much as I like the actors in this film, the voice work does not come ANYWHERE NEAR that of Shark's Tale, or most other good animated films that you might consider. Many parents will want to like this film for reasons I've already mentioned -- but I really believe that its creators were thinking like adults -- not kids -- when they wrote it and produced it. A good children's movie has to be *charming*, not just hyperactive. This one, unfortunately, lacks that charm.",3,More enjoyable as time goes on...,1132099200,"11 16, 2005",2005,5766,"['UPDATE', 'Jan.', '2007Well', 'never', 'know', 'A', 'first', 'viewing',

636210,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JNX0,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","There is something so adorably manic about this movie that I can't help but totally love it.  It just continues to bring a smile to my face no matter how many times I see it (which is a lot considering my daughter's fascination with it).  The crude-like animation (it's pretty, but it's also clunky in an odd way) and the dead-pan humor add to the enjoyment factor because this feels like a perfect balance of adult and child entertainment.Nothing will go over their heads, and nothing will fly under yours.The film follows an oddly mismatched group of animals who form a bond while living out their lives in the New York Zoo (depicted as like the smallest zoo in the history of forever).  One of those `friends' is Marty, a zebra who loathes the confines of his `area' and dreams of running free in his homeland.  His best friend is Alex, the conceited and self-centered lion who is the prime attraction of the zoo, and he takes that rather seriously.  Gloria, the hippo, is soft hearted yet opinionated and Melman is a germaphobic and paranoid giraffe.  Together, they make a fun group who wind up being shipwrecked on the island of Madagascar after a botched escape plan lands them on a boat headed for Kenya that is hijacked by penguins and rerouted.Yes, it's that kind of movie.Once on the island, Alex becomes devastated and irritated while Marty soaks it all in like he's hit the jackpot.  Then, they meet the lemurs and the lunacy begins as their leader tries to use the island's new inhabitants as cyphers for the island's dreaded carnivores.The music is fun, the voice acting is genius (especially on the part of Sacha Baron Cohen, David Schwimmer and Chris Miller) and the overall enjoyment factor is really, really high here.

636212,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00005JNX0,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[1, 1]","This is what happens when you choose top talents all around to make an animated film:  you get a tight story, likeable and distinct characters, great dialog and a quirky but state of-the-art look.  What's more, the adults as well as the kids are entertained.  All this and more went into the making of Madagascar.Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) are fast friends in a New York zoo.  We presume they have lived there all their lives because it's obvious that none of them are aware of the natural order of predators and prey.  They are also every bit the pampered New Yorkers that any celebrity humans of the city are; they live on schedules, customized diet plans and adoration.  For the most part the animals are quite content with their urban lifestyle, except that is for Marty.  He dreams of what it would be like to run free in the wild - or at least his fantasy version of the wild that he gets from zoo murals and publicity ads.  So one day, he orchestrates his own escape just for the heck of it, and his friends must follow in order to, uh, save him.  It was a disaster all around, but it got the attention of animal rights nuts, which ended in all of the animals heading on a ship for a wildlife preserve in Africa.To make a long story shorter, the penguins had plans of their own and they hijacked the ship for Antarctica.  The four animal friends were jettisoned overboard accidentally and then drifted off course to the island of Madagascar (which they mistake for the San Diego Zoo).  This is the setup for some of the funniest misunderstandings and comedic moments of the movie.  Was the wild everything that Marty was hoping for?  Can Alex get over the loss of his star status now that he has competition from a lemur king - and more importantly, where is he going to find a steak in this freaky new place?  And, will Melman and Gloria be able to keep them all out of trouble?As far as I am concerned, Madagascar is the best family film since Toy Story 2 (which my kids watched nearly every day for a few months, once upon a time.  I know, it's just horrible of me!:).  Everything was superbly done, from the big name stars' voices on down to the minor characters', the design of the animals, landscapes, etc and the little details that went into the animation. The humor worked through dialog jokes on the adult level (but never inappropriately) and visually for the kids.  The whole experience had LOL moments and a sense of fun and delight.  And of course it was impossible to resist the adorable but not syrupy lemurs and penguins.  I can honestly not find one thing to fault or criticize about this movie - splendid job!Dvd extras include interviews with the cast and creators, which I found fun and interesting.

We saw this with our kids at a friends house and immediately bought the DVD. Not only is it a great movie, but it has some fabulous extras.The story is about 4 friends at the New York Zoo - Alex the lion, Melman the Giraffe, A Zebra and Gloria the Hippopotamus. The penguins escape setting up a longing in the Zebra for freedon, even at Connecticut. So he escapes one night to try to get to the wide open spaces of Connecticut, just for the night. alex, Gloria and Melman race off to bring him back, not knowing he was coming back on his own. However it goes horribly bad and they get bundled up to be sent off back to a wildlife preserve in Kenya. Only the Penguins make a break on the container ship first, taking it over and driving it to Antarctica. The sudden turn in the ship unsettles the load and the 4 friends float off in their containers, landing in Madagascar.Wonderful animation, and hugely good-humoured. There is King Julian the strange 'squirrel' who is king of the Lemurs on Madagascar, they are all afraid of the 'foosa' who are some kind of feral lions. King Julian (voiced by the wonderful Sacha Baron Cohen aka Ali G) is fabulous, not only is the voice great, but so is the script.The penguins are also a highlight, the voices are great, the animation is fabulous, and the script is wonderful for them. There are gorgeous little touches in this movie and the penguins have some of the best of them. Talking of special features, there is a nice little movie in the DVD special features of the Penguins at Christmas at the zoo - priceless!There are some good special features on this, one of the best is if you flick the up switch over play a couple of penguins appear, click OK and see how the animation is made, how Alex's mane is animated, how they make animals run in sand, how Madagascar jungle is pasted together from a variety of different types of trees and so on. It is simply sketches set to music but it is wonderful.This is such an appealing movie, it is fun for all ages and the DVD has several features which are also appealing to everyone.",5,Great fun! now officially one of the King Julian Fan club,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,2171,"['thought', 'would', 'be', 'stack', 'rubbish', 'having', 'seen', 'preview', 'was', 'Shrek', 'video', 'saw', 'kids', 'friends', 'house', 'immediately', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Not', 'only', 'great', 'movie', 'fabulous', 'extras.The', 'story', '4', 'friends', 'New', 'York', 'Zoo', 'Alex', 'lion', 'Melman', 'Giraffe', 'A', 'Zebra', 'Gloria', 'Hippopotamus', 'penguins', 'escape', 'setting', 'up', 'longing', 'Zebra', 'freedon', 'even', 'Connecticut', 'So', 'one', 'night', 'try', 'get', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'Connecticut', 'just', 'night', 'alex', 'Gloria', 'Melman', 'race', 'bring', 'back', 'not', 'knowing', 'was', 'coming', 'back', 'own', 'However', 'horribly', 'bad', 'get', 'bundled', 'up', 'be', 'sent', 'off', 'back', 'wildlife', 'preserve', 'Kenya', 'Only', 'Penguins', 'make', 'break', 'container', 'ship', 'first', 'taking', 'driving', 'Antarctica', 'sudden', 'turn', 'ship', 'load', '4', 'friends', 'float', 'off', 'containers', 'landing', 'Madagascar.Wonderful', 'animation', 'hugely', 'good-humoured', 'King', 'Julian', 'strange', ""'squirrel"", 'who', 'king', 'Lemurs', 'Madagascar', 'are', 'afraid', ""'foosa"", 'who', 'are', 'kind', 'feral', 'lions', 'King', 'Julian', 'voiced', 'wonderful', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Ali', 'G', 'fabulous', 'not', 'only', 'voice', 'great', 'so', 'script.The', 'penguins', 'are', 'also', 'highlight', 'voices', 'are', 'great', 'animation', 'fabulous', 'script', 'wonderful', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'little', 'touches', 'movie', 'penguins', 'have', 'best', 'Talking', 'special', 'features', 'nice', 'little', 'movie', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'Penguins', 'Christmas', 'zoo', 'priceless', 'are', 'good', 'special', 'features', 'one', 'best', 'flick', 'up', 'switch', 'play', 'couple', 'penguins', 'appear', 'click', 'OK', 'see', 'how', 'animation', 'made', 'how', 'Alex', 'mane', 'animated', 'how', 'make', 'animals', 'run', 'sand', 'how', 'Madagascar', 'jungle', 'pasted', 'together', 'variety', 'different', 'types', 'trees', 'so', 'simply', 'sketches', 'set', 'music', 'wonderful.This', 'such', 'appealing', 'movie', 'fun', 'ages', 'DVD', 'several', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'appealing', 'everyone']",Madagascar

However there's something to be said about a cartoon that (unlike most past releases) doesn't really try so hard to push a moral lesson into you.  ""Madagascar"" is one such film.  I can't remember the last animated feature film that was made just for pure entertainment.  Sure, you can say it's about how friendship conquers all, etc. etc. but when it comes right down to it, ""Madagascar"" is just all about fun.  And yeah, for the lack of finding more proper words, it's just plain cute.  The film is about a bunch of animals who have grown up in a simple New York zoo.  One animal, Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock) longs for the chance to run around in the wide open wild.  His three friends, Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer), and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett-Smith), try to make him realize that he's living a good life in the zoo where they are, this reviewer notes, excessively pampered extravagantly.A bunch of penguins successfully break out of the zoo in the hopes of reaching Antartica.  This prompts the zebra to realize that he could visit his wild roots and he breaks out of the zoo.  His three friends break out as well in the hopes of returning him to the zoo, but this is seen by us simple-minded humans as a sign that the animals desire to return to their natural habitat.One mishap leads to another in the process of their return to the wild and they end up in a mysterious island where they meet a tribe of party-happy lemurs led by Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen) who, with his aides Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and Mort (Andy Richter), reveal that their tribe is under threat by the carnivorous feline Fousa.Cohen steals the show from the entire cast whenever his character, King Julian, is on screen.  He even overshadows such intimidating personalities as Cedric the Entertainer, who just feels lackluster or out of place in this film.  Disappointing is Andy Richter as the Gizmo-lookalike Mort.  I'm a fan of Richter since the Conan O'Brien show, and I know he's capable of better roles than this.  Mort sure is cute though.  :)Nevertheless, the film was animated with as much care as any recently put out CGI film.  And the cast seems to have had a genuine ball with their roles.

Along the way boat is hijacked by the penguins (who are the cutest characters besides the two chimps) and get stranded in Madagascar, meeting a dumb bunch of lemurs.

The huge success of ""The Incredibles"" was not in the excellent CGI work, but in the fact that the story could have worked just as well with live actors.  Good script, good dialogue, and good acting really do make a difference.However, the studios that churn out these CGI vehicles on a regular basis don't seem to have noticed this.  They think that if you get some big-name talent for your voices, throw in a little slapstick, some toilet humor (for the under-10 crowd) and some hip pop culture references (for the parents slowly dying in their seats), then you have the makings of another blockbuster.  Certainly this movie ultimately will show a modest profit for the investors, but if I recall correctly, the box office results can be charitably described as tepid.When we watched it, the kids were, at best moderately engaged by the movie.  They've seen enough CGI so that it is no longer a novelty.  There just wasn't enough in the movie itself to hold their interest...the characters were either uninteresting or annoying, and the storyline meandered too much to hold their interest.

636245,A21T2ZAT0QA0KO,B00005JNX0,ChildInside,"[0, 3]","Long ago, before this movie was even in threaters, I saw some commercials for it and I admit that I was excited. At the time, Pixar was kicking ass and taking names. They made some incredible animated movies. Not merely that, but other companies were getting in on it and I enjoyed some of the other companies' efforts, such as Ice Age.So I thought that maybe Madagascar would be as enjoyable. In the end, it wasn't nearly so, but it is still fairly good.The main problem with this movie is that it isn't immersive. What made Pixar's creations so enjoyable was how well you could feel the characters' emotions. In Madagascar, however, the movie allocates far too little time to character development for this to occur.For example, the two main characters of the movie is Alex and Marty. We know that Marty is unhappy with his condition at the NY zoo, but Alex and the others seem perfectly happy. Why is this? What is giving Marty these emotions of emptiness? He experienced the same thing that his friends experienced because they're together all the time, so what set in these emotions for Marty? What kind of personality does he have that allows him to have these emotions?And this is exactly what I'm talking about. You never discover the personalities of the characters, not even the main characters. Instead, the directors gave them generic emotions. We all know they love each other and they wouldn't purposely hurt each other, but we don't know what makes them run. We never discover what lies deep inside of them, what makes them who they are.Of course, however, I may be attempting to find depth in a movie that was created merely for entertainment. Pixar may have spoiled me with the unbelievably well crafted Finding Nemo.Anyway, though, to get to the point, I do enjoy this movie somewhat. Unlike most who seems to like the penguins, though, I actually like the interaction between Julien, Maurice, and Mort the most, though. I personally thought that was the high point of the movie.If you're looking to watch this movie, it may work better as a rent than a buy.",3,"Very generic stuff, but enjoyable nonetheless",1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,2076,"['Long', 'ago', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'threaters', 'saw', 'commercials', 'admit', 'was', 'excited', 'time', 'Pixar', 'was', 'kicking', 'ass', 'taking', 'names', 'made', 'incredible', 'animated', 'movies', 'Not', 'merely', 'other', 'companies', 'were', 'getting', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'companies', 'efforts', 'such', 'Ice', 'Age.So', 'thought', 'maybe', 'Madagascar', 'would', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'so', 'still', 'fairly', 'good.The', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'immersive', 'What', 'made', 'Pixar', 'creations', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'how', 'well', 'could', 'feel', 'characters', 'emotions', 'Madagascar', 'however', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'occur.For', 'example', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'Alex', 'Marty', 'know', 'Marty', 'unhappy', 'condition', 'NY', 'zoo', 'Alex', 'others', 'seem', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'Why', 'What', 'giving', 'Marty', 'emotions', 'emptiness', 'experienced', 'same', 'thing', 'friends', 'experienced', ""'re"", 'together', 'time', 'so', 'what', 'set', 'emotions', 'Marty', 'What', 'kind', 'personality', 'have', 'have', 'emotions', 'exactly', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'never', 'discover', 'personalities', 'characters', 'not', 'even', 'main', 'characters', 'Instead', 'directors', 'gave', 'generic', 'emotions', 'know', 'love', 'other', 'would', ""n't"", 'purposely', 'hurt', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'run', 'never', 'discover', 'what', 'deep', 'what', 'who', 'are.Of', 'course', 'however', 'may', 'be', 'attempting', 'find', 'depth', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'merely', 'entertainment', 'Pixar', 'may', 'have', 'spoiled', 'unbelievably', 'well', 'crafted', 'Finding', 'Nemo.Anyway', 'though', 'get', 'point', 'do', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'most', 'who', 'like', 'penguins', 'actually', 'interaction', 'Julien', 'Maurice', 'Mort', 'most', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'high', 'point', 'movie.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'watch', 'movie', 'may', 'work', 'better', 'rent', 'buy']",Madagascar

636257,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005JNX0,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 3]","Tom McGrath, the producer of this movie does the voice on Skipper the Penguin.  He should do cartoons, because he was a perfect match.  The penguins MAKE this movie, along with Melman (David Schwimmer) and Julius the Lemur King (Sacha Baron Cohan)!  First off I just want to say that critics are not always right, and this is proof of that.  You begin to realize that critics get stuck in a mold.  They don't like more than a handful of elements for a movie and feel that anything that breaks that mold is just not good.  Thats why I hardly ever listen to them, and for one, I am glad I went to see this.  There was actually a scene where I laughed so hard I was crying.  Just wait until our four legged friends meet the Lemurs.  THE BEST SCENE EVER!  So the movie starts with Marty the Zebra (Rock) turning 10 years old and he's wishing he was in the wild.  Alex the Lion (Stiller) is his best friend (a little self centered, which I fould hilarious because I took my eight year old nephew to this movie and his name is Alex and he is EXTREMLY self centered!) and Alex is trying to convince Marty the wild is bad...I mean come on, what can be better than the NY zoo (which by the way looks really small in this movie)  In the meantime Marty meets the penguins (McGrath) who are planning to escape and make their way to Antarctica.  So Marty breaks out that night and tries to make it to CT, since that's where Melman tells him the wild is (it's funny trust me) and that's where his friends Gloria (Pinket-Smith), Melman and of course Alex try and find him.  In an effort to do so they all (penguins included) end up on a ship to Kenya.  The penguins aren't having that so they kidnap the captain and turn the ship around towards Antarctica.  In the process Marty, Alex, Melman and Gloria are tossed overboard and washed up on Madagascar.  The rest of the movie is pretty much Marty trying to make the best of things and Alex trying to get rescued, the other two are pretty much just along for the ride...But the greatest part of the plot here revolves around the Lemurs.  See there is some weird kind of cat called the Foosca that are feeding on the Lemurs and the King of the Lemurs Julius decides that they must befriend Alex the Lion so he can protect them from the Foosca, all of this against the will of his advisor played by Cedric the Entertainer.  The rest of this movie is priceless and one of the best scenes involves the Penguins making it to Antarctica.  ""This sucks""...it's great...just wait, you'll love it.  So my recomendation is watch this movie.  It's better than Shark Tale, more livly than The Incredibles and just as, if not funnier than Shrek...You'll love it!",5,Penguins kick butt!,1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,2683,"['Tom', 'McGrath', 'producer', 'movie', 'voice', 'Skipper', 'Penguin', 'should', 'do', 'cartoons', 'was', 'perfect', 'match', 'penguins', 'MAKE', 'movie', 'Melman', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Julius', 'Lemur', 'King', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohan', 'First', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'critics', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'right', 'proof', 'begin', 'realize', 'critics', 'get', 'stuck', 'mold', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'more', 'handful', 'elements', 'movie', 'feel', 'anything', 'mold', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'Thats', 'why', 'hardly', 'ever', 'listen', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'went', 'see', 'was', 'actually', 'scene', 'where', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'was', 'crying', 'Just', 'wait', 'four', 'legged', 'friends', 'meet', 'Lemurs', 'THE', 'BEST', 'SCENE', 'EVER', 'movie', 'Marty', 'Zebra', 'Rock', 'turning', '10', 'years', 'old', 'wishing', 'was', 'wild', 'Alex', 'Lion', 'Stiller', 'best', 'friend', 'little', 'self', 'centered', 'fould', 'hilarious', 'took', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'nephew', 'movie', 'name', 'Alex', 'EXTREMLY', 'self', 'centered', 'Alex', 'trying', 'convince', 'Marty', 'wild', 'bad', 'mean', 'come', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'NY', 'zoo', 'way', 'really', 'small', 'movie', 'meantime', 'Marty', 'penguins', 'McGrath', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'escape', 'make', 'way', 'Antarctica', 'So', 'Marty', 'out', 'night', 'tries', 'make', 'CT', 'where', 'Melman', 'wild', 'funny', 'where', 'friends', 'Gloria', 'Pinket-Smith', 'Melman', 'course', 'Alex', 'try', 'find', 'effort', 'do', 'so', 'penguins', 'included', 'end', 'up', 'ship', 'Kenya', 'penguins', 'are', ""n't"", 'having', 'kidnap', 'captain', 'turn', 'ship', 'towards', 'Antarctica', 'process', 'Marty', 'Alex', 'Melman', 'Gloria', 'are', 'tossed', 'overboard', 'washed', 'up', 'Madagascar', 'rest', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'Marty', 'trying', 'make', 'best', 'things', 'Alex', 'trying', 'get', 'rescued', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'along', 'ride', 'greatest', 'part', 'plot', 'here', 'Lemurs', 'See', 'weird', 'kind', 'cat', 'called', 'Foosca', 'are', 'feeding', 'Lemurs', 'King', 'Lemurs', 'Julius', 'must', 'befriend', 'Alex', 'Lion', 'can', 'protect', 'Foosca', 'will', 'advisor', 'played', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'rest', 'movie', 'priceless', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'Penguins', 'making', 'Antarctica', 'sucks', 'great', 'just', 'wait', ""'ll"", 'love', 'recomendation', 'watch', 'movie', 'better', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'more', 'livly', 'Incredibles', 'just', 'as', 'not', 'funnier', 'Shrek', ""'ll"", 'love']",Madagascar

They get food on demand and the public adore them, but Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) still pines for the wild. After a botched escape attempt lands him and his friends on a remote beach, the animals have to learn to fend for themselves. Striking a perfect balance between wit, slapstick and self-awareness, Madagascar is as fluffy as a meringue and twice as tasty.From the moment that Marty bounds delightedly across the screen to the ironic strains of Born Free, it's clear that we're dealing with DreamWorks the minds that brought us Shrek.

636265,A3CT2I82NPANNS,B00005JNX0,Desiree Troy,"[1, 2]","The DreamWorks production of the children's film, Madagascar, is definitely a creative and unique look at animals living in the Central Park Zoo in New York City. The movie begins with a quartet of penguins from the same zoo who think and act like military commandos and are attempting to tunnel their way out of the city to Antarctica. Instead, they happen to pop out of the ground (literally) in a penned up area where a zebra named Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) lives and entertains the crowds that come to visit him. Recently, Marty has been wondering what the wild is like and when he hears that the penguins are escaping he gets an idea in his head about heading down to Grand Central Station and hopping a train to the pleasant wilderness that is Connecticut. Nothing goes according to plan, however, when Marty escapes as well and his best friend Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) and their two friends Gloria the hippo (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the giraffe (voiced by David Schwimmer) decide to go after him for an intervention. One can imagine how well New York citizens react to a zebra, lion, hippo, and giraffe just wandering around Times Square, a subway station, and Grand Central Station. Due to Marty's curiosity, all four friends eventually find themselves aboard a ship on its way to Kenya, Africa. Yet, once the penguins realise what's happening, thanks to a couple somewhat dignified monkeys who also attempted to escape captivity after the other break-outs, they escape their crate, knock out a few humans and take control. During all of this, Alex is absolutely furious with Marty and is making such a fuss that he ends up knocking all four crates containing his friends and himself overboard where they wash ashore on the island of Madagascar.This movie's target audience is most certainly children although teenagers and adults would be able to enjoy it as well. However, I doubt that it would be as enjoyable for a teen or adult to watch because whilst they would recognise it as a comedy, they would not be very amused by the animal's antics after watching a decade or so of cartoons with the same sort of jokes and characters. Still, what makes this movie different from the cartoons of a teenager's or adult's childhood is that the characters are much more distinct and have very diverse personalities that do not prevent them all from being friends and interacting with one another despite their differences. For example, Alex, a sociable lion with a satisfying role as the main attraction at the Central Park Zoo is best friends with Marty, an exuberant zebra with a healthy curiosity with the world outside of his enclosure. Instead of thinking of Marty as a meal, he thinks of him as a close friend who he can always cheer up with a rousing lion/zebra rendition of New York, New York. They also happen to be friends with a neurotic hypochondriac giraffe and a hippo with a maternal instinct for her friends and most other creatures she encounters. The characters in this movie are entertaining, slightly educational in that children can learn some basic lessons through their adventures, and interesting.The animation was particularly impressive considering how difficult it is to create something like this. Whilst I watched the movie, I do admit to being overly critical but then I watched the DVD features labelled ""Behind the Crates"" and ""The Tech of Madagascar"", which made me respect everyone who entered into this project and everyone who has worked on past productions like this (such as the Shrek movies). The story for the movie was created mostly for children but the people who put their time and energy into creating the graphics laboured over their contributions to the movie. They were determined to make an enjoyable movie that would hopefully eventually be thought of as a children's classic. If you were unable to enjoy the storyline, I recommend watching these DVD features to get a better understanding of all that went into the movie before you arrive at any sort of set opinion on the movie. It will change your perspective.In addition to the ""Behind the Crates "" and ""The Tech of Madagascar"" features, I enjoyed watching the first ever Penguin Commentary and the twelve minute special entitled The Penguins in a Christmas Caper, which starred the quartet of penguins from Madagascar. It begins with Private looking out a periscope at the surrounding enclosures around Christmastime and noticing that the polar bear is all alone. Private wants to help the polar bear have a nice Christmas, but of course Skipper doesn't want to get involved which causes Private to go behind his back and leave the relative safety of the zoo (at least he's less likely to get slapped about so much out on the sidewalks of New York City, never mind potentially getting stepped on) to go find a gift for the polar bear.I will end this review now with saying that I enjoyed this movie and found it refreshing as I am used to watching a lot of very poorly made movies that were basically pointless and plot-less. I recommend this movie to anyone with children and to anyone who needs to take a look back and remember that not every movie is disappointing. A lot of thought and effort went into creating this movie and it shows.",4,"Well, you hate them compared to how much I like them!",1133395200,"12 1, 2005",2005,5280,"['DreamWorks', 'production',

636268,A1AYEI2SNFPYES,B00005JNX0,Dogville,"[3, 9]","Madagascar features a bunch of animals, a lion, a zebra, a hippo and agiraffe specifically who are well-fed and cared for in a city centrezoo in New York. By day, there are stars of the zoo, performingover-the-top stunts and attracting the crowd. That was until the 10thbirthday of Marty the zebra when he decided to do something with hislife by living his dream of being back in the wilderness. Inspired by afew escaping penguins, he too left for Central Park station and by some strange twist of fate, all of them landed on Madagascar.Like Shark Tale, the story borders on being a shallow tale. Some of the scenes like the animals taking the city subway and roaming the streets are just simply incredulous. Dialogs are sometimes banal or slapstick, although I must say the star of the voiceovers must be Chris Rock who brings his comedic persona into the character of Marty.The scene where Marty and Alex meet on the beach after a near-shipwreck set against the Vangeli's Chariots of Fire is simply cheesy while the one with Alex mimicking the famous rose-dropping in American Beauty was top-notch.In the end, I am not too sure if they are advocating that animals should be keptin captivity so that they don't have to face the adverse conditions of the wilderness or we should celebrate the camaraderie between different spiecesthough the thought of a carnivorous animal thinking twice before savouring its prey in the wild is rather unthinkable.

636274,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JNX0,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 2]","I was not that interested in seeing this latest animated DreamWorks concoction until I saw an 11-minute short, ""A Christmas Caper"" just before the wondrous Wallace and Gromit feature, ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"". In expertly rendered computer animation, it starred four physically adroit penguins who not coincidentally steal the feature-length film from which they originate. At 86 minutes, ""Madagascar"" has several entertaining scenes, brightly colored images and a kinetic pace that doesn't flag, but somehow the film falls short of the Pixar features to which the creators seem to aspire. A lot of it has to do with co-directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath trying too hard and co-screenwriters Mark Burton and Billy Frolick cramming a lot of story within its comparatively brief running time. They provide some sharp lines and winking references to other movies, but the movie lacks an ironic punch that would have made it truly memorable.The plot focuses on two animals, best friends in spite of their different species - a curiously dissatisfied zebra named Marty, who dreams of what life must be like outside his admittedly comfortable digs at the Central Park Zoo in New York, and an egocentric lion named Alex, who enjoys the limelight at the zoo but comes to terms with his natural tendencies amid the wilds of the jungle. It is both a blessing and a curse to have Chris Rock and Ben Stiller provide the voices for Marty and Alex respectively.  While they provide some expectedly funny moments, their motor-mouthed presence makes the film pretty exhausting to sit through without fidgeting, especially as Rock seems to be imitating Eddie Murphy's Donkey in the ""Shrek"" series. Neither seems to be directed to develop characters but rather magnify their personalities. Faring marginally better on the sidelines are Jada Pinkett-Smith as Gloria, the no-nonsense hippopotamus, and David Schwimmer in Ross Geller overdrive as Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe.Once the setting moves to the Rousseau-like tableaux of Madagascar, the movie improves considerably with the addition of comical lemurs in thrall of the crate-wrecked visitors -  Sacha Baron Cohen, a.k.a. Ali G, plays the hilariously despotic King Julien XIII with a heavy dollop of Indian curry, Cedric the Entertainer is the put-upon Maurice and Andy Richter makes the saucer-eyed Mort sound like the first cousin of a Spielberg gremlin. There is even a nod to the actual ""Born Free"" movie not only in the use of the theme song in the opening but in a relatively somber sequence that has Alex coming back to his natural tendencies among the feared fossas to the increasing fear of his lifelong friends. But the movie's brightest spots are provided by the four penguins (voiced by members of the crew) and two erudite monkeys who are used mostly as transitional cues in the story.The DVD has a fairly standard set of extras, though I liked the alternate audio commentary track provided by the penguins. The deleted scenes, ""Mad Mishaps"", are fairly incompressible for their deletion other than the fact that they aren't in finished form, and ""The Tech of Madagascar"" is quite dry as is usual for seeing the mechanics behind computer animation. For the kids, there is the video for the inescapable ""I Like to Move It, Move It"" song by the lemurs and video games galore, as well as ""Enchanted Island"", a genuine educational featurette on the real Madagascar.",3,A Blitzkrieg of Colorful Images and One-Liners Covers a Soft-Centered Core,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,3427,"['was', 'not', 'interested', 'seeing', 'latest', 'animated', 'DreamWorks', 'concoction', 'saw', '11-minute', 'short', 'Christmas', 'Caper', 'just', 'wondrous', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'feature', 'Curse', 'Were-Rabbit', 'expertly', 'rendered', 'computer', 'animation', 'starred', 'four', 'physically', 'adroit', 'penguins', 'who', 'not', 'coincidentally', 'steal', 'feature-length', 'film', 'originate', '86', 'minutes', 'Madagascar', 'several', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'brightly', 'colored', 'images', 'kinetic', 'pace', ""n't"", 'flag', 'somehow', 'film', 'short', 'Pixar', 'features', 'creators', 'seem', 'aspire', 'lot', 'do', 'co-directors', 'Eric', 'Darnell', 'Tom', 'McGrath', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'co-screenwriters', 'Mark', 'Burton', 'Billy', 'Frolick', 'cramming', 'lot', 'story', 'comparatively', 'brief', 'running', 'time', 'provide', 'sharp', 'lines', 'winking', 'references', 'other', 'movies', 'movie', 'ironic', 'punch', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'truly', 'memorable.The', 'plot', 'focuses', 'two', 'animals', 'best', 'friends', 'spite', 'different', 'species', 'curiously', 'dissatisfied', 'zebra', 'named', 'Marty', 'who', 'what', 'life', 'must', 'be', 'admittedly', 'comfortable', 'digs', 'Central', 'Park', 'Zoo', 'New', 'York', 'egocentric', 'lion', 'named', 'Alex', 'who', 'limelight', 'zoo', 'terms', 'natural', 'tendencies', 'wilds', 'jungle', 'blessing', 'curse', 'have', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'voices', 'Marty', 'Alex', 'respectively', 'provide', 'expectedly', 'funny', 'moments', 'motor-mouthed', 'presence', 'film', 'pretty', 'exhausting', 'sit', 'fidgeting', 'especially', 'Rock', 'be', 'imitating', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Donkey', 'Shrek', 'series', 'be', 'directed', 'develop', 'characters', 'rather', 'magnify', 'personalities', 'Faring', 'marginally', 'better', 'sidelines', 'are', 'Jada', 'Pinkett-Smith', 'Gloria', 'no-nonsense', 'hippopotamus', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Ross', 'Geller', 'overdrive', 'Melman', 'hypochondriac', 'giraffe.Once', 'setting', 'moves', 'Rousseau-like', 'tableaux', 'Madagascar', 'movie', 'considerably', 'addition', 'comical', 'lemurs', 'thrall', 'crate-wrecked', 'visitors', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'a.k.a', 'Ali', 'G', 'hilariously', 'despotic', 'King', 'Julien', 'XIII', 'heavy', 'dollop', 'Indian', 'curry', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'put-upon', 'Maurice', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'saucer-eyed', 'Mort', 'sound', 'first', 'cousin', 'Spielberg', 'gremlin', 'even', 'nod', 'actual', 'Born', 'Free', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'use', 'theme', 'song', 'opening', 'relatively', 'somber', 'sequence', 'Alex', 'coming', 'back', 'natural', 'tendencies', 'feared', 'fossas', 'increasing', 'fear', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'movie', 'brightest', 'spots', 'are', 'provided', 'four', 'penguins', 'voiced', 'members', 'crew', 'two', 'erudite', 'monkeys', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'mostly', 'transitional', 'cues', 'story.The', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'standard', 'set', 'extras', 'liked', 'alternate', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'provided', 'penguins', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Mad', 'Mishaps', 'are', 'fairly', 'incompressible', 'deletion', 'other', 'fact', 'are', ""n't"", 'finished', 'form', 'Tech', 'Madagascar', 'quite', 'dry', 'usual', 'seeing', 'mechanics', 'computer', 'animation', 'kids', 'video', 'inescapable', 'Move', 'Move', 'song', 'lemurs', 'video', 'games', 'galore', 'as', 'well', 'Enchanted', 'Island', 'genuine', 'educational', 'featurette', 'real', 'Madagascar']",Madagascar

Not bad thinking, but un-original.  We simpley O.D.ed on Disney-style animation.  A great art form, but too much.Of course, there was this little thing called ""Toy Story"" that came along and really changed everything.  And we got many great CG animated films such as all the Pixar films, Shrek, Ice Age (shrek Jr.), Antz and even Jimmy Neutron.  Unfortunately, now all the participating studios have forgotten past lessons.  But there is a difference this time.  This time, corporate greed has exceeded it's quota.  These CG films are so filled with trendy music, product placements, and so-so actors that they are losing the one element that makes great film;  STORY.  And though the films still make money, they nolonger feel ""special"".  Soon enough, they will nolonger make money either.Here's some things that make ""Madagascar"" no better than 3 stars in my mind:-All of the voice actors are very trending and(to me)extremely annoying.  Ironically, the no-name voices are the entertaining ones.-I consider The yellow bar on the DVD case that says ""#1 family film of the year"" as a warning that when translated reads; ""Bare-bones DVD inside.  Forced promotional spots included"".  (See Shrek2).-""The Incredibles"" (the last really good CG film) has everything ""Madagascar"" does not; Great stroy, great characters, great imagery and not the least bit trendy.-Madagascar is so heavy with trendy, sales oriented gimicks that it will become dated very quickly.  Not as bad as ""Shark tale"" but trendy none-the-less.-Caracter development is thin.  Each character has their gimmicky ""thing"" but it does not help you like or care about them.-The penguin side story (voiced by animators)is actually more funny and entertaining than the ""lead"" characters' story line.  Their arival ""home"" is a classic ""cartoon"" moment.-Chris Rock, David Schwimmmer, Ben Stiller...  ... I can't think of three, more annoying actors.  Stiller, as a voice, is non-descript.-Kids do enjoy this movie, but they like ""Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" too.-Lemers epitomise this whole story; Self-serving, annoying, loud, obnoxiuos, gimmick-laden and cheeky.  The little song they sing is kind of ammusing though.-The style of the characters was actually pretty cool.  A very cartoony, exagurated look.-My wife and I left the theater basically unaffected.  Can you think of a worse thing to say about any film?-I Think I would have enjoyed the film much more if the animals never talked.  There were enough ""cute"" moments to make it worthwhile.After all this, I ask myself (you may have wondered too) ""how on earth did I give it 3 start instead of 1?"".  I guess it is because I really do enjoy animation on all levels.  A lot of artists put a lot of themselves into this production.  I guess I'm dissapointed in the overall feal of the film.  CG is nolonger a guarantee that a film will be entertaining (let alone good).  If more productions like ""Madagascar"" get made, people will stop flocking to the theater just because a film is produced in 3d CG. As Syndrome said in ""The Incredibles""; ""When everyone's super, Then no one will be"".",3,Luke-warm in the Tropics.

636278,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B00005JNX0,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[3, 5]","A long time ago, y'know, in the `90's, computer-animated films were amazing spectacles.  The technical wizardry involved in making these movies was almost as much incentive to see the film as a good storyline.  Sadly, these days audiences have, as usual, become jaded, and no longer care about the fact that these films are being made with what is still, technically, a revolutionary new filmmaking technique.I still have a soft spot for computer-animated features, mainly of the Pixar variety.  It is my personal opinion that ""Shrek"" isn't nearly as great as everyone thinks it is.  It, and DreamWorks' last feature ""Shark Tale"" rely so heavily on pop culture references that they seem pretty lame a few years down the road.  (It's true!  Watch the original ""Shrek"" and see if you really think any of those `90's pop references are still cool.)However, DreamWorks may be working its way toward Pixar territory with its latest film, ""Madagascar"".  Rather than being a pop culture hit parade, this film has strong characters with (relatively) complicated relationships providing the humor and drama.Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller), a lion who is a popular attraction at the New York Zoo, is living it up in the lap of civilized luxury.  Free steaks, an adoring public, and a warm place to sleep at night, what more could you want?  His zebra friend Marty (Chris Rock), however, dreams of going to The Wilds, like it's an actual place rather than an idea.  When Marty makes a break for it, Alex enlists the help of his other friends, Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith), a motherly-but-tough hippo, and Melman (David Schwimmer), a neurotic hypochondriac of a giraffe, to track the runaway zebra down.  After being recaptured by humans, the foursome are sent off on a cargo ship to Africa to be returned to the wild.  But a sneak attack by some commando penguins (too complicated to explain; trust me, it's funny) ends up stranding them all on the island of Madagascar.  The blame game goes around, and sure enough, tensions mount in this wild paradise.What makes ""Madagascar"" stand out from the other DreamWorks pictures is that rather than being a pop culture smoothie, this film has humor coming from funny situations and funny characters.  And with charming secondary characters, like a band of party-loving lemurs and the aforementioned commando penguins, there are plenty of humorous characters to go around.  Don't get me wrong, there are still some allusions strewn about, but they don't take the forefront this time.Perhaps the most interesting thing about this film, for me anyway, was that rather than go hyper-realistic (such as in ""Shrek 2""), the computer animation had a, well, animated look.  Like Pixar's ""The Incredibles"", just because they could make photorealistic people and animals, they didn't necessarily have to.A final word of warning:  Learn from my mistake; don't go to the first matinee showing on Saturday unless you like movie theaters filled with loud, rambunctious and whiny children with few adults in sight!",4,"Going wild with ""Madagascar""",1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,3027,"['long', 'time', 'ago', '90', 'computer-animated', 'films', 'were', 'amazing', 'spectacles', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'involved', 'making', 'movies', 'was', 'almost', 'much', 'incentive', 'see', 'film', 'good', 'storyline', 'Sadly', 'days', 'audiences', 'have', 'usual', 'become', 'jaded', 'no', 'longer', 'care', 'fact', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'what', 'still', 'technically', 'revolutionary', 'new', 'filmmaking', 'technique.I', 'still', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'computer-animated', 'features', 'mainly', 'Pixar', 'variety', 'personal', 'opinion', 'Shrek', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'great', 'everyone', 'DreamWorks', 'last', 'feature', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'rely', 'heavily', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'seem', 'pretty', 'lame', 'few', 'years', 'road', 'true', 'Watch', 'original', 'Shrek', 'see', 'really', 'think', '90', 'pop', 'references', 'are', 'still', 'cool', 'However', 'DreamWorks', 'may', 'be', 'working', 'way', 'Pixar', 'territory', 'latest', 'film', 'Madagascar', 'Rather', 'being', 'pop', 'culture', 'hit', 'parade', 'film', 'strong', 'characters', 'relatively', 'complicated', 'relationships', 'providing', 'humor', 'drama.Alex', 'voiced', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'lion', 'who', 'popular', 'attraction', 'New', 'York', 'Zoo', 'living', 'up', 'lap', 'civilized', 'luxury', 'Free', 'steaks', 'adoring', 'public', 'warm', 'place', 'sleep', 'night', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'want', 'zebra', 'friend', 'Marty', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'however', 'dreams', 'going', 'Wilds', 'actual', 'place', 'rather', 'idea', 'When', 'Marty', 'break', 'Alex', 'help', 'other', 'friends', 'Gloria', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'motherly-but-tough', 'hippo', 'Melman', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'neurotic', 'hypochondriac', 'giraffe', 'track', 'runaway', 'zebra', 'down', 'being', 'recaptured', 'humans', 'foursome', 'are', 'sent', 'off', 'cargo', 'ship', 'Africa', 'be', 'returned', 'wild', 'sneak', 'attack', 'commando', 'penguins', 'too', 'complicated', 'explain', 'trust', 'funny', 'up', 'stranding', 'island', 'Madagascar', 'blame', 'game', 'around', 'sure', 'enough', 'tensions', 'mount', 'wild', 'paradise.What', 'Madagascar', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'DreamWorks', 'pictures', 'rather', 'being', 'pop', 'culture', 'smoothie', 'film', 'humor', 'coming', 'funny', 'situations', 'funny', 'characters', 'charming', 'secondary', 'characters', 'band', 'party-loving', 'lemurs', 'aforementioned', 'commando', 'penguins', 'are', 'plenty', 'humorous', 'characters', 'go', 'around', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'still', 'allusions', 'strewn', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'forefront', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'film', 'anyway', 'was', 'rather', 'go', 'hyper-realistic', 'such', 'Shrek', '2', 'computer', 'animation', 'had', 'well', 'animated', 'look', 'Pixar', 'Incredibles', 'just', 'could', 'make', 'photorealistic', 'people', 'animals', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'to.A', 'final', 'word', 'warning', 'Learn', 'mistake', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'first', 'matinee', 'showing', 'Saturday', 'like', 'movie', 'theaters', 'filled', 'loud', 'rambunctious', 'whiny', 'children', 'few', 'adults', 'sight']",Madagascar

636283,A2MRZPTMYFADUV,B00005JNX0,Frodo,"[5, 5]","Over recent years, Dreamworks have produced a string of films aimed to entertain young children. However with the exception of ""Shrek,"" to the older audience, their films are somewhat lame and bland. But after watching ""Madagascar,"" for which I had low expectations, even I had to admit that Dreamworks did a mighty good job. I sat down with my younger sister (who I'll add ADORES this film) and I chuckled and smiled my way through this surprisingly charming Dreamworks success.Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) is an ambitious zebra who has spent the past decade cramped in Central Park's New York City zoo. Unlike his best friend Alex, who, ironically, is a lion (Ben Stiller), Marty dreams to live in the wide open spaces of ""the wild."" In the film's introduction we also meet Melmen, a giraffe who is a hyperchondriac (""Friends""' David Schwimmer) and Gloria, a self-assured hippopotamus (Jada Pinkett Smith). In an amusing twist of events, the four friends manage to escape the confinds of the zoo. To Marty's delight and Alex's sheer horror, they consequently land themselves on ship to a game reserve in Africa. In ANOTHER twist of events, they then become stranded on the island of Madagascar. The film then takes an interesting turn when Alex's carivorous instinct soon threatens his friendship with Marty, thus encouraging Marty to make the ultimate decision between his dream and his friendship.I actually thought the storyline of ""Madagascar,"" was quite well-shaped and original. All animals, even those demosticated always carry with them those instincts and abilities that help them survive in the unforgiving wilderness. I want to really commend the film for their interesting exploration of this concept.The film's story is accentuated and brightened by its child-friendly, yet pleasant humor. Stiller, Rock and Schwimmer are all renowned for their experience in comedy, which is evident through many of the film's amusing scenes. However, I didn't feel that the characters of Melmen and Gloria were given enough limelight. The film focussed a little too much on Alex and Marty's characters, and didn't explore the other two nearly as much. David Schwimmer's Melmen, I think, was the funniest character of the four, and so it would have been great if the audience saw more of him.Unlike Pixar films, which are aimed to appeal across the ages, ""Madagascar"" is predominantly aimed at younger children, so naturally the gags were somewhat repetative. But this is hardly a bad thing. As I mentioned before, my nine-year-old sister simply loves this film, and she was in barrels of laughter throughout. For older viewers, although not to the same extent, there is certainly a charm that I found endearing.Another aspect I must comment on is the film's abundant colour. I personally, am more of a Disney animation fan, however I am at awe at the vibrance and brightness of computer-animation, making it wholly appealling to its target audience of young children.In conclusion, ""Madagascar,"" is not quite ""Finding Nemo,"" but I really did enjoy and chuckle my way through.

He has been raised in the zoo all his life, and his birthday wish is to depart the zoo.  His wishes are further strengthened when a group of penguins, who are also in the midst of an escape, accidental burrow into Marty's pen.  The penguins are by far the best thing this film has to offer, and steal every scene their in.  I could have easily watched an entire film the penguins escapades, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.Marty hears of a magical place called ""Connecticut"" and upon the zoo's closing, he flees the zoo to find his paradise.  After discovering his absents, his friends: Alex (Stiller), Melman (Schwimmer), and Gloria (Smith) follow after him.  All four are soon captured, but instead of being returned to the zoo, they are crated up and sent to Africa.As computer generated films go, this film isn't the greatest; however, it's not the worst either.  The film just seems to go through the motions of being a film.  After viewing it, there is nothing that seems to stick in your mind worth remembering.  I guess what tickled me the most, was at the beginning of the film I was saying to myself, ""Wow, a lion and a zebra are friends (one carnivore and one herbivore)""; to my surprise, this ends up playing a very pivotal plot point in the film.I really feel that there is nothing to gain by rushing out to see this film, I'd just wait for its DVD release.[...]",3,Wait for the DVD,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,1904,"['***', 'Spoilers***Ben', 'Stiller', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'star', 'newest', 'computer', 'generated', 'film', 'Dreamworks', 'Studios', 'film', 'centers', 'four', 'animals', 'Alex', 'Lion', 'Marty', 'Zebra', 'Melman', 'Giraffe', 'Gloria', 'Hippo', 'held', 'captive', 'New', 'York', 'state', 'zoo', 'none', 'are', 'mistreated', 'rather', 'very', 'heavily', 'pampered', 'Marty', 'Rock', 'dreams', 'being', 'free', 'wild.The', 'film', 'Marty', 'celebrating', '10th', 'birthday', 'middle', 'life', 'crisis', 'been', 'raised', 'zoo', 'life', 'birthday', 'wish', 'depart', 'zoo', 'wishes', 'are', 'further', 'strengthened', 'when', 'group', 'penguins', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'midst', 'escape', 'accidental', 'burrow', 'Marty', 'pen', 'penguins', 'are', 'far', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'offer', 'steal', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'watched', 'entire', 'film', 'penguins', 'escapades', 'alas', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be.Marty', 'hears', 'magical', 'place', 'called', 'Connecticut', 'zoo', 'closing', 'zoo', 'find', 'paradise', 'discovering', 'absents', 'friends', 'Alex', 'Stiller', 'Melman', 'Schwimmer', 'Gloria', 'Smith', 'follow', 'four', 'are', 'soon', 'captured', 'instead', 'being', 'returned', 'zoo', 'are', 'crated', 'up', 'sent', 'Africa.As', 'computer', 'generated', 'films', 'go', 'film', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'however', 'not', 'worst', 'either', 'film', 'just', 'go', 'motions', 'being', 'film', 'viewing', 'nothing', 'stick', 'mind', 'remembering', 'guess', 'what', 'tickled', 'most', 'was', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'saying', 'myself', 'Wow', 'lion', 'zebra', 'are', 'friends', 'one', 'carnivore', 'one', 'herbivore', 'surprise', 'up', 'playing', 'very', 'pivotal', 'plot', 'point', 'film.I', 'really', 'feel', 'nothing', 'gain', 'rushing', 'out', 'see', 'film', ""'d"", 'just', 'wait', 'DVD', 'release.', '[', ']']",Madagascar

636300,A2LPCZ7UBT4Y6N,B00005JNX0,"Jameson L. Thottam ""mortgage maven""","[9, 14]","Jameson Thottam: Animation Review of MadagascarWe've now reached the point in the CG cycle where we no longer ask ""Is it as good as Pixar?"" The new question regarding computer animation movies is ""Is it better than Shark Tale?"" And considering that ""Madagascar"" is the next CG family comedy from DreamWorks, after the aggressively unpleasant ""Shark Tale,"" the question takes on a little more relevance. Two ""Shark Tale""s in a row would be a sign of even worse things to come. So it's with much relief and a mild thumbs-up that I assure you: ""Madagascar"" is, indeed, better than ""Shark Tale.""Since every single CGI family flick is practically guaranteed 150 million bucks at the box office, and this review is therefore entirely unnecessary and actually kind of pointless, I'll keep the review brief.Kid Fun - Jameson L. ThottamIf you've got a kid under the age of 12, you'll want to take them to see Madagascar, because they'll probably have a darn good time with it. OK, I know that's not all that lofty of an endorsement; kids are notorious for loving just about any ol' cartoon that's laden with pratfalls, animals, and kooky sound effects. But Madagascar proves to be just charming and witty enough to keep the grown-ups entertained while the rugrats fall into the aisles in peals of hysterical laughter.That Old Black Pixar Magic: Jameson Luke ThottamThat's not to imply that Madagascar comes close to achieving that seemingly patented brand of Pixar Magic. No, the Pixar movies are clearly in a class by themselves. While something like The Incredibles offers layer upon layer of stunningly satisfying cinematic goodness, a movie like Madagascar is all about high-end animation, amiable silliness, and a whole lot of physical schtick.Storyline: Jameson L. ThottamMadagascar is about four goofy animals who (unwittingly) escape from their Central Park zoo, travel across the ocean, and ultimately end up stranded in a deep, dark jungle. Our heroes are a lion (Ben Stiller), a zebra (Chris Rock, a hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and a giraffe (David Schwimmer). There are a few rather aimless plot threads about finding one's roots, being loyal to friends, and learning how to deal with the fact that you just might be hungry enough to eat your best friend -- but Madagascar is less about plot than it is about silly animals doing goofy things.Voices from the Past: Jameson L ThottamAside from Schwimmer, the voice-actors seem content to just play themselves, which makes an ironic point: these rather expensive leading men are among the movie's biggest detriments. Say what you will about Mike Myers' Shrek, but at least that guy's using a different voice to help create an animated character. So not for even a second are you ""getting to know"" this lion and that zebra. You're just listening to Ben Stiller and Chris Rock as their words spill out of animated mammals. Tough gig, eh fellas?I'm sorry but ""voice acting"" and ""speaking into a microphone"" are not exactly the same thing. And it's irritating that a guy like Ben Stiller can just monotone his way through a performance and earn a huge paycheck while someone like, say, Billy West could have done something truly hilarious with this role.But there's some good news on the other side of the coin: Andy Richter gets a lot of solid laughs as a devious penguin, and Sacha Cohen absolutely steals the entire movie as a lunatic lemur. Toss in a few hilarious gags from a pair of wise-guy monkeys, and you're looking at a supporting cast that upstages the stars with no effort whatsoever. OK, fair's fair: David Schwimmer really does have a great voice for animated comedies, but I still stand by this opinion: Nearly all of Madagascar's laughs come from the supporting characters, and from a movie that stars Ben Stiller and Chris Rock, that's a pretty telling statement.Chuckles for all generations: Jameson ThottamParents, you already know if your kids are going to be dragging you into ""Madagascar,"" so I'll save you some stress by telling you that the flick made me laugh with a fairly surprising consistency. Many of the film's best chuckles come courtesy of the fast-paced animation style -- and the rest come from the background penguins, monkeys, and lemurs. My humble advice to the DreamWorks Animation Bureau would simply be this: skip the A-list voice-actors the next time out. The kids are going to line up around the block either way, and without all that excess salary and ego, you're inevitably bound to make a better movie.Jameson Luke Thottam",4,Jameson Thottam: Animation Review of Madagascar,1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,4515,"['Jameson', 'Thottam', 'Animation', 'Review', 'MadagascarWe', ""'ve"", 'now', 'reached', 'point', 'CG', 'cycle', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'ask', 'as', 'good', 'Pixar', 'new', 'question', 'regarding', 'computer', 'animation', 'movies', 'better', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'considering', 'Madagascar', 'next', 'CG', 'family', 'comedy', 'DreamWorks', 'aggressively', 'unpleasant', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'question', 'little', 'more', 'relevance', 'Two', 'Shark', 'Tale', 's', 'row', 'would', 'be', 'sign', 'even', 'worse', 'things', 'come', 'much', 'relief', 'mild', 'thumbs-up', 'assure', 'Madagascar', 'indeed', 'better', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'single', 'CGI', 'family', 'flick', 'practically', 'guaranteed', '150', 'million', 'bucks', 'box', 'office', 'review', 'therefore', 'entirely', 'unnecessary', 'actually', 'kind', 'pointless', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'review', 'brief.Kid', 'Fun', 'Jameson', 'L.', 'ThottamIf', ""'ve"", 'got', 'kid', 'age', '12', ""'ll"", 'want', 'take', 'see', 'Madagascar', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'darn', 'good', 'time', 'OK', 'know', 'not', 'lofty', 'endorsement', 'kids', 'are', 'notorious', 'loving', 'just', 'ol', 'cartoon', 'laden', 'pratfalls', 'animals', 'kooky', 'sound', 'effects', 'Madagascar', 'be', 'just', 'charming', 'witty', 'enough', 'keep', 'grown-ups', 'entertained', 'rugrats', 'fall', 'aisles', 'peals', 'hysterical', 'laughter.That', 'Old', 'Black', 'Pixar', 'Magic', 'Jameson', 'Luke', 'ThottamThat', 'not', 'imply', 'Madagascar', 'close', 'achieving', 'seemingly', 'patented', 'brand', 'Pixar', 'Magic', 'No', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'are', 'clearly', 'class', 'something', 'Incredibles', 'layer', 'layer', 'stunningly', 'satisfying', 'cinematic', 'goodness', 'movie', 'Madagascar', 'high-end', 'animation', 'amiable', 'silliness', 'whole', 'lot', 'physical', 'schtick.Storyline', 'Jameson', 'L.', 'ThottamMadagascar', 'four', 'goofy', 'animals', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'escape', 'Central', 'Park', 'zoo', 'travel', 'ocean', 'ultimately', 'end', 'up', 'stranded', 'deep', 'dark', 'jungle', 'heroes', 'are', 'lion', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'zebra', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'hippo', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'giraffe', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'are', 'few', 'rather', 'aimless', 'plot', 'threads', 'finding', 'one', 'roots', 'being', 'loyal', 'friends', 'learning', 'how', 'deal', 'fact', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'hungry', 'enough', 'eat', 'best', 'friend', 'Madagascar', 'less', 'plot', 'silly', 'animals', 'doing', 'goofy', 'things.Voices', 'Past', 'Jameson', 'L', 'ThottamAside', 'Schwimmer', 'voice-actors', 'seem', 'content', 'just', 'play', 'ironic', 'point', 'rather', 'expensive', 'leading', 'men', 'are', 'movie', 'biggest', 'detriments', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'Shrek', 'least', 'guy', 'using', 'different', 'voice', 'help', 'create', 'animated', 'character', 'So', 'not', 'even', 'second', 'are', 'getting', 'know', 'lion', 'zebra', ""'re"", 'just', 'listening', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'words', 'spill', 'animated', 'mammals', 'Tough', 'gig', 'eh', 'fellas', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'voice', 'acting', 'speaking', 'microphone', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'same', 'thing', 'irritating', 'guy', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'can', 'just', 'monotone', 'way', 'performance', 'earn', 'huge', 'paycheck', 'someone', 'say', 'Billy', 'West', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'role.But', 'good', 'news', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'lot', 'solid', 'laughs', 'devious', 'penguin', 'Sacha', 'Cohen', 'absolutely', 'entire', 'movie', 'lunatic', 'lemur', 'Toss', 'few', 'hilarious', 'gags', 'pair', 'wise-guy', 'monkeys', ""'re"", 'looking', 'supporting', 'cast', 'stars', 'effort', 'whatsoever', 'OK', 'fair', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'really', 'have', 'great', 'voice', 'animated', 'comedies', 'still', 'stand', 'opinion', 'Nearly', 'Madagascar', 'laughs', 'come', 'supporting', 'characters', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'pretty', 'telling', 'statement.Chuckles', 'generations', 'Jameson', 'ThottamParents', 'already', 'know', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'dragging', 'Madagascar', ""'ll"", 'save', 'stress', 'telling', 'flick', 'made', 'fairly', 'surprising', 'consistency', 'Many', 'film', 'best', 'chuckles', 'come', 'courtesy', 'fast-paced', 'animation', 'style', 'rest', 'come', 'background', 'monkeys', 'lemurs', 'My', 'humble', 'advice', 'DreamWorks', 'Animation', 'Bureau', 'would', 'simply', 'be', 'skip', 'A-list', 'voice-actors', 'next', 'time', 'out', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'line', 'up', 'block', 'way', 'excess', 'salary', 'ego', ""'re"", 'inevitably', 'bound', 'make', 'better', 'movie.Jameson', 'Luke', 'Thottam']",Madagascar

I have a great idea for a movie people, check this out.....Take all the supporting characters from all these movies (Donkey from Shrek, Dori from Nemo, the penguins from this, the Jamaican characters from Shark Tale, Mr. Potato Head from Toy Story 1 & 2, the crazy squirrel from Ice Age) and give each and every one of them there own movies, cuz' most of them are all better then the main characters they are ""supporting""Anyway, enough of that, back to the movie. It seems Marty the Zebra (Decent vocals by Chris Rock) wants to go back to the wild, and he and his 3 buddies get carted up and get shipped away on a boat. Of course they somehow fall overboard and end up on this island (Madagascar) There they fall in with some Lemurs and Foosa's (Still not sure what the hell these were) while trying to avoid becoming lunch from Alex the lion, who is a good lion, but is seeing everyone as steaks, cuz' the poor guy is missin' life at the zoo!!!Ben Stiller actually overdoes it as Alex the lion, he is non-stop chatter and it gets kinda annoying after a while, shut him up and let the penguins have some more screen time. David Schwimmer is the Giraffe, nothing special here, maybe a few funny lines when he is stuck in his crate, but that's about it. Then there is Jada Pinkett-Smith as Gloria the hippo, completely useless and really not needed in this movie at all, very few lines, even fewer funny or even decent lines, get rid of her so our penguins can have some more time!!!!!The chemistry between any of these animals is not very strong, Alex and Marty are supposed to be best friends but ya don't feel it, the animation is decent, not at a Shrek or Nemo level, but still fun to watch.The positives? Gee, what do you think I'm gonna say? OH HELL YEAH!!! THE PENGUINS BABY!!! they absolutely steal the show, every scene they are in is hilarious, problem is, they just aren't in it too much. They are military in everything they do and the jokes never stop coming and all of them work.

Even the plot sounds like something an amateur kids' book author was trying to come up with:""Hmm... how about Alex the Lion and Marty the Zebra try to escape the zoo?  That should be worth a lot of laughs!""As a fun, breezy comedy, the movie fails in an astonishing way.  As a commentary on the conflicts of civilization versus nature and the ethics of vegetarianism, it's terrible, but at least it provides you with some good material to make fun of.  You know you're in trouble when you have more fun pointing out the lack of logic in a zany comedy than you have enjoying the zaniness.The jokes in ""Madagascar"" can be divided chiefly into three categories: poo jokes, movie references, and slapstick.  The sad thing is, the poo jokes are actually the only funny parts of the movie, and there's only three or four of them.  The movie references are just dumb---they leave you wishing that the movie tried to parody other movies instead of simply referencing them.The slapstick, which comprises roughly 85% of the movie, fails because it breaks one of the rules of comedy: wacky antics only work when you have at least one ""straight"" character.  Having two clowns jump all over the screen honking horns at each other and throwing pies into their faces isn't funny because they're both manic.  After a couple of seconds, ""manic"" becomes the norm and there's nothing left to surprise you.  Humor comes from something unusual or different that jumps out at you and you go, ""Wow, that was odd.  And funny!""  Instead of two clowns, you have two guys in business suits conducting a boring meeting in an office, and then one of them randomly pulls out a pie and throws it at the other.""Madagascar"" ruins this by having nothing BUT manic characters.  There are no straight characters in the movie---everybody is full of too much energy.  The four main characters simply fight with each other for more attention from the camera, and instead of trying to do anything clever and funny, they just get more and more ""zany.""  It works for about two minutes before the movie just gets completely dull.If you are a very young child, then you'll like all the flashy colors and the bounciness and wackiness.  You'll want to see it all again and again for hours.  But ""Madagascar"" is the sort of movie that you'll watch again when you've turned 23 and you'll say, ""Wow, I was stupid when I was a kid.""The movie has one saving grace, which is unfortunately neglected.  The penguins steal the show; unlike the rest of the cast, the penguins switch off between being calm, collected, straight characters and over-the-top, zany, wacky characters.  They are consistently funny and also the most adorable of all the animals.  In every scene they appear, you wish that the movie was about them.  Unfortunately, they only have about four minutes of screen-time in total.  A true waste of a good concept.",1,What a lame movie.,1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,3405,"['Have', 'ever', 'gone', 'movie', 'theater', 'cleared', 'out', 'mind', 'nagging', 'thoughts', 'then', 'said', 'yourself', ""'m"", 'going', 'just', 'try', 'not', 'over-analyze', 'have', 'popcorn-movie', 'fun', 'then', 'when', 'movie', 'was', '30', 'minutes', 'realized', 'were', 'so', 'bored', 'would', 'actually', 'prefer', 'just', 'nitpick', 'be', 'angry', 'over-analyzing', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'fun', 'just', 'kicking', 'back', 'how', 'Madagascar', 'dull', 'boring', 'bland', 'insipid', 'other', 'synonym', 'can', 'think', 'Even', 'plot', 'something', 'amateur', 'kids', 'book', 'author', 'was', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'Hmm', 'how', 'Alex', 'Lion', 'Marty', 'Zebra', 'try', 'escape', 'zoo', 'should', 'be', 'lot', 'laughs', 'fun', 'breezy', 'comedy', 'movie', 'astonishing', 'way', 'commentary', 'conflicts', 'civilization', 'versus', 'nature', 'ethics', 'vegetarianism', 'terrible', 'least', 'good', 'material', 'make', 'fun', 'know', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'when', 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'pointing', 'out', 'lack', 'logic', 'zany', 'comedy', 'have', 'enjoying', 'zaniness.The', 'jokes', 'Madagascar', 'can', 'be', 'divided', 'chiefly', 'three', 'categories', 'poo', 'jokes', 'movie', 'references', 'slapstick', 'sad', 'thing', 'poo', 'jokes', 'are', 'actually', 'only', 'funny', 'parts', 'movie', 'only', 'three', 'four', 'movie', 'references', 'are', 'just', 'dumb', '-they', 'leave', 'wishing', 'movie', 'tried', 'parody', 'other', 'movies', 'instead', 'simply', 'referencing', 'them.The', 'slapstick', 'roughly', '85', '%', 'movie', 'one', 'rules', 'comedy', 'wacky', 'antics', 'only', 'work', 'when', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'straight', 'character', 'Having', 'two', 'clowns', 'jump', 'screen', 'honking', 'horns', 'other', 'throwing', 'pies', ""n't"", 'funny', ""'re"", 'manic', 'couple', 'seconds', 'manic', 'norm', 'nothing', 'left', 'surprise', 'Humor', 'something', 'unusual', 'different', 'out', 'go', 'Wow', 'was', 'odd', 'funny', 'Instead', 'two', 'clowns', 'have', 'two', 'guys', 'business', 'suits', 'conducting', 'boring', 'meeting', 'office', 'then', 'one', 'randomly', 'out', 'pie', 'other', 'Madagascar', 'having', 'nothing', 'BUT', 'characters', 'are', 'straight', 'characters', 'movie', '-everybody', 'full', 'too', 'much', 'energy', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'simply', 'fight', 'other', 'more', 'attention', 'camera', 'instead', 'trying', 'do', 'anything', 'clever', 'funny', 'just', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'zany', 'two', 'minutes', 'movie', 'just', 'completely', 'dull.If', 'are', 'very', 'young', 'child', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'flashy', 'colors', 'bounciness', 'wackiness', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'hours', 'Madagascar', 'sort', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'when', ""'ve"", 'turned', '23', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Wow', 'was', 'stupid', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'movie', 'one', 'saving', 'grace', 'unfortunately', 'neglected', 'penguins', 'steal', 'show', 'rest', 'cast', 'penguins', 'switch', 'off', 'being', 'calm', 'collected', 'straight', 'characters', 'over-the-top', 'zany', 'wacky', 'characters', 'are', 'consistently', 'funny', 'also', 'most', 'adorable', 'animals', 'scene', 'appear', 'wish', 'movie', 'was', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'have', 'four', 'minutes', 'screen-time', 'total', 'true', 'waste', 'good', 'concept']",Madagascar

First of all my 8-year old loved it and he was the main reason I went to see the film. Second, it's not THAT bad. There's lots of energy; the actors sound like they're having a great time (and that counts for something); the animation is good and quite frankly, there's no swearing or bloodshed.Ok, but really, there's not much in the way of a story. It's just a string of old, recycled schticks some of which are attempts at sly ""wink, wink"" stuff the grown ups will get. But pop culture references only go so far (and less and less far given how over-used they are in this movie).If you're looking for the fun, originality, and intelligence of Shrek or Toy Story or even the Incredibles do yourself a favor. Rent the original version of Shrek (not Shrek II which I thought was lame) or Toy Story (I or II both were fabulous) or the Incredibles or Finding Nemo or Holes, pop some pop corn, gather round the TV and enjoy these great movies again.

636321,AA3EC3LKOBD80,B00005JNX0,Jonathan Cohen,"[2, 2]","""Madagascar"", like most of the Dreamworks animated movies, is a kitchen-sink hodgepodge. The good news is that this hodgepodge is better than anything I've seen from this outfit, and that includes both ""Shreks"". Kids will love these truly funny animals, while their moms and dads will get a boot out of bits that spoof everything from ""Seinfeld"" (a major influence on this movie) to ""The Twilight Zone"".The first section of ""Madagascar"" is set in New York City, where the four ""zoosters""- Alex the lion (voice of Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett-Smith), and my favorite, Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer)- are the stars of the Central Park zoo and pampered beyond belief after the kids go home. One day, Marty decides to escape the zoo and take the train to the wilds of Connecticut. Ever see a zebra in Times Square? A giraffe on the subway? A lion emerging onto the concourse at Grand Central? Some clever animation brings old-time ""Looney Tunes"" tricks to the computer era as our heroes, cornered by a hundred of New York's finest, wind up in crates on a freighter, Kenya-bound. Soon, the Four Penguins- the unsung stars of this movie- start one of their wiseguy capers and hijack the ship. The four crates fall off the boat and, ""Survivor""-style, wash up on the beaches of what they assume to be the San Diego Zoo- but it's really the huge island of Madagascar, where they interact with a merry band of lemurs led by goofy dancing King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen, aka ""Ali G"")and his skunk-like sidekick Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer).That's the story, such as it is. The movie, however, doesn't have the well-defined characters and themes that, in my mind, Pixar will always do best. What it does have is a dizzying array of slapstick gags, a ""Friends""/""Seinfeld"" dialogue rhythm (at least in the NYC portion), quickie skits that touch on old TV shows (Marty surfs onto the beach to the strains of the ""Hawaii Five-0"" theme) and other movies (Alex talks to a soccer ball, ""Cast Away""-style), and similar touches that will definitely tickle your funny bone. More than almost any computer-animated movie I've seen, ""Madagascar"" tries- and largely succeeds- to create what its crew calls ""more cartoon-y gags and characters"".A good array of extra features include not only interviews with the voice cast and director/writers, but a look at the ""stretch"" effects that, in the words of one animator, are""very difficult with computers"". They're especially good on anything involving Melman, the lovably-neurotic, pill-popping giraffe. The best extra, however, is ""The Penguins' Christmas Caper"", which brings the four birds front and center in a very funny holiday tale. Tom McGrath, the ""Madagascar"" co-director and writer, also voices the penguins' leader with a very amusing New York cop-style sneer. Musical selections could be a little better- veteran Hans Zimmer's best contribution is a pulsing lion-show theme for Alex- but the use of pop/theme cues does get a little heavy-handed. I loved the penguin short's music, though:two nifty ""Jingle Bells"" takeoffs by Brian Setzer (swing-a-billy)and the Brave Combo (klezmer-ized!). As for the voices, Stiller can be overbearing and smug, while Rock seems to be a little tentative. But Schwimmer, having played a sub-Woody Allen role on ""Friends"" for ten years, has his lovable-mope bit down pat. Baron Cohen's peculiar Euro-Indian accent can grate, but I loved his greeting to the American visitors: ""Hail the New York Giants!"" Finally, there's a look at the real Madagascar and how the filmmakers replicated some of this distant island nation's one-of-a-kind fauna and flora. (Incidentally, you couldn't see ""Madagascar"" on Madagascar- its capital city has a million people and only one movie house!)""Madagascar"" may be a Dreamworks pastiche, but it's a pretty good one.

636330,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNX0,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 4]","In the campy computer animated film Madagascar a quartet of zoo animals find themselves pondering and experiencing the meaning of life and the social context of life.  It is an interesting idea to contemplate that what a zoo animal would think, if they existed outside of the fences of the zoo.  However, several studies have shown that animals that have grown up in captivity run a great chance of extinction once released into the wild.  Nevertheless, animated comedy tries to apply the notion of setting free tame animals into the wilderness, which offers an amusing rollercoaster that throws pies and pulls the chair from underneath the audience with a myriad of silly slapstick moments.Several computer-animated films that have received a blockbuster release such as Toy Story (1995), Shrek (2001), and The Incredibles (2004), and sequels have also driven in a large chunk of money.  Most CGI animations have been exceptional in their narratives, thus why not make another animated film with the help of computers.  However, Madagascar lacks some of the brilliant storytelling that has gone hand-in-hand with CGI films.  Unfortunately, most of the film tends to build on previously applied humor, and an exaggerated amount of slapstick humor.  After awhile the silly tripping and slams in the face become an uninspiring event of repetitive thinking and mere time fillers in the featured film.Despite the negative aspects, there is still some greatness within the film, as the four animals Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) begin their journey into the unknown.  The caricature of the quartet is terrific, as the Alex superego emerges in the gifts he gives his friends and the overwhelmingly hysterical hypochondriac Melman.  The best part in the film is the four scheming penguins that are on a mission to return to the snowy widths of Antarctica, and the meeting with Sacha Baron Cohen a.k.a. Ali G's lemur persona King Julien XIII.The story opens with an amusing dream sequence where Marty dreams of his personal paradise in the wilderness, as he is racing towards a small lake.  Alex, who also chased him in the dream, shatters this dream.  It is an amusing comparison between the dream and reality, as Marty's reality consists of having a lion as a friend while in the dream Alex was chasing him.  Furthermore, it suggests the idea of a twisted sense of reality that Marty and the other zoo animals possess.  To broaden the concept of twisted reality, it might serve as an analogical perspective of humanity's la-la land vision of life's permanence and the idea of existential safety.  However, this is to stretch the artistic process of the computer-animated zoological journey into an intellectual domain, which illustrates a number of interesting concepts in the light of Darwin where the strongest survive.Marty decides to make his dream reality, as he escapes to explore the world.  Actually he intends to explore New York and maybe a little of what lays beyond the city borders.  However, his three friends intend to find him and return him to the safety of the zoo while they all are unaware of humans true feelings of wild animals, in particular lions.  To their dismay, they learn that they are returning to Africa, as society deems that they belong in their natural habitat.  However, after an accident relating four penguins involved in a large ship hijacking, the quartet lands on the beaches of Madagascar.  Several different emotions flush through them such as anger, fear, panic, happiness, and hope, as they try to get their bearings on the life in the wild.  It is amusing to see how they handle the new situation, as they mostly appear like people visiting a foreign culture.  The quartet's narrow-minded comments to King Julien and his entourage is compared to Californians having a P. Diddy party, which is understandable as it is all they know.Ultimately, Madagascar delivers comic relief to both young and old, even though this film will most likely be more entertaining to the younger viewers with its high level of slapstick humor.  Compared to other recent films with CGI animation Madagascar does not succeed in delivering an equally impressive storyline, yet it clearly finishes above an average cinematic experience.  There are both hits and misses within the story.  It is obvious that it will entertain an audience, but it misses a story with thorough substance from beginning to the end and it hurts the overall cinematic experience.",3,CGI Slapstick Humor in the Decent Return to the Wild...,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,4578,"['campy', 'computer', 'animated', 'film', 'Madagascar', 'quartet', 'zoo', 'animals', 'find', 'pondering', 'experiencing', 'meaning', 'life', 'social', 'context', 'life', 'interesting', 'idea', 'contemplate', 'what', 'zoo', 'animal', 'would', 'think', 'existed', 'fences', 'zoo', 'However', 'several', 'studies', 'have', 'shown', 'animals', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'captivity', 'run', 'great', 'chance', 'extinction', 'once', 'released', 'wild', 'Nevertheless', 'animated', 'comedy', 'tries', 'apply', 'notion', 'setting', 'free', 'tame', 'animals', 'wilderness', 'amusing', 'rollercoaster', 'pies', 'chair', 'audience', 'myriad', 'silly', 'slapstick', 'moments.Several', 'computer-animated', 'films', 'have', 'received', 'blockbuster', 'release', 'such', 'Toy', 'Story', '1995', 'Shrek', '2001', 'Incredibles', '2004', 'sequels', 'have', 'also', 'driven', 'large', 'chunk', 'money', 'Most', 'CGI', 'animations', 'have', 'been', 'exceptional', 'narratives', 'thus', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'animated', 'film', 'help', 'computers', 'However', 'Madagascar', 'brilliant', 'storytelling', 'gone', 'hand-in-hand', 'CGI', 'films', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'film', 'build', 'previously', 'applied', 'humor', 'exaggerated', 'amount', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'silly', 'tripping', 'slams', 'face', 'become', 'uninspiring', 'event', 'repetitive', 'thinking', 'mere', 'time', 'fillers', 'featured', 'film.Despite', 'negative', 'aspects', 'still', 'greatness', 'film', 'four', 'animals', 'Alex', 'Lion', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Marty', 'Zebra', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Gloria', 'Hippo', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'Melman', 'Giraffe', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'begin', 'journey', 'unknown', 'caricature', 'quartet', 'terrific', 'Alex', 'superego', 'gifts', 'friends', 'overwhelmingly', 'hysterical', 'hypochondriac', 'Melman', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'four', 'scheming', 'penguins', 'are', 'mission', 'return', 'snowy', 'widths', 'Antarctica', 'meeting', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'a.k.a', 'Ali', 'G', 'lemur', 'persona', 'King', 'Julien', 'XIII.The', 'story', 'amusing', 'dream', 'sequence', 'where', 'Marty', 'dreams', 'personal', 'paradise', 'wilderness', 'racing', 'small', 'lake', 'Alex', 'who', 'also', 'chased', 'dream', 'shatters', 'dream', 'amusing', 'comparison', 'dream', 'reality', 'Marty', 'reality', 'having', 'lion', 'friend', 'dream', 'Alex', 'was', 'chasing', 'Furthermore', 'idea', 'twisted', 'sense', 'reality', 'Marty', 'other', 'zoo', 'animals', 'possess', 'broaden', 'concept', 'twisted', 'reality', 'might', 'serve', 'analogical', 'perspective', 'humanity', 'la-la', 'land', 'vision', 'life', 'permanence', 'idea', 'existential', 'safety', 'However', 'stretch', 'artistic', 'process', 'computer-animated', 'zoological', 'journey', 'intellectual', 'domain', 'number', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'light', 'Darwin', 'where', 'strongest', 'survive.Marty', 'decides', 'make', 'dream', 'reality', 'explore', 'world', 'Actually', 'explore', 'New', 'York', 'maybe', 'little', 'what', 'city', 'borders', 'However', 'three', 'friends', 'intend', 'find', 'return', 'safety', 'zoo', 'are', 'unaware', 'humans', 'true', 'feelings', 'wild', 'animals', 'particular', 'lions', 'dismay', 'learn', 'are', 'returning', 'Africa', 'society', 'belong', 'natural', 'habitat', 'However', 'accident', 'relating', 'four', 'penguins', 'involved', 'large', 'ship', 'hijacking', 'quartet', 'beaches', 'Madagascar', 'Several', 'different', 'emotions', 'flush', 'such', 'anger', 'fear', 'panic', 'happiness', 'hope', 'try', 'get', 'bearings', 'life', 'wild', 'amusing', 'see', 'how', 'handle', 'new', 'situation', 'mostly', 'appear', 'people', 'visiting', 'foreign', 'culture', 'quartet', 'narrow-minded', 'comments', 'King', 'Julien', 'entourage', 'compared', 'Californians', 'having', 'P.', 'Diddy', 'party', 'understandable', 'know.Ultimately', 'Madagascar', 'comic', 'relief', 'young', 'old', 'even', 'film', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'younger', 'viewers', 'high', 'level', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'Compared', 'other', 'recent', 'films', 'CGI', 'animation', 'Madagascar', 'not', 'succeed', 'delivering', 'equally', 'impressive', 'storyline', 'clearly', 'average', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'are', 'hits', 'misses', 'story', 'obvious', 'will', 'entertain', 'audience', 'story', 'thorough', 'substance', 'beginning', 'end', 'overall', 'cinematic', 'experience']",Madagascar

Lion ""kimbawlion.com""","[7, 12]","Just when I declared that I was sick to death of CG (or so-called ""3D"") animation, Madagascar comes along and shows that Dreamworks has taken CG animation to the next level. Up til now, CG has been primitive, trying for all it's worth to emulate reality and coming up with nothing better than a ""rubber doll"" look. The folks who made Madagascar seem to have woke up and said, ""Hey, this is a cartoon--why try for realism?"" And it works. Finally, CG starts to explore the realm 2D animation has existed in for decades: artistic expression. The animation, the writing, and the acting come together to make a very enjoyable, very funny movie.It's like, CG animation up til now has been stuck in the Winsor McKay/Gertie the Dinosaur era, stiffly trying to give the illusion of reality. With Madagascar, one step has been taken into the Pat Sullivan/Felix the Cat era, realizing that mere reality is not the point of animation. If others follow Dreamworks' lead, maybe I won't be cringing at the thought of the next animated feature to be released.Now that I think about it, Dreamworks has succeeded in doing something Warner Brothers always failed at: make a feature-length Looney Tune(R) that works. Madagascar is fun from beginning to end.And, if you're a parent who cares enough to elevate the experience above a plop your brat in front of the screen and switch his brain off movie, there are some aspects to the story that are worth talking about with your kid afterwards.

636337,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JNX0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","""Madagascar"" must be a very maddening movie for young kids who go with their parents, because at moments when they are not laughing their parents very well could be and the kiddies will have no clue why.  After all, how many pre-teens have seen the end of the original version of ""The Planet of the Apes,"" the beginnings of ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Chariot of Fire,"" or have even heard the theme song from ""Born Free""?  I expect they may have seen ""Castaway"" and might well recognize a homage to the dancing hippos from ""Fantasia,"" but is it reasonable to think they saw ""The Twilight Zone"" episode ""To Serve Man""?  I realize that when kids are laughing they probably are not aware of what their parents or guardians are doing, but since they will not be laughing at most of these pop culture references to other films, they may well be awrae that the older people are watching a different movie.Ultimately the problem is that the different ""Madagascar"" that the grownups are watching is clearly funnier than the one that is trying to keep the wee folk entertained.  The story is about four animals who are best buds at the Central Park Zoo.  Alex the Lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) is the star of the show and a devotee of raw steak, while Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) is tired of looking at the fake jungle painted on the wall and longs to be free in the wild, not really knowing what that means.  Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) is a hypochondriac, worried about the brown spots on his skin, while Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinikett Smith), is a rather contented soul.  But when the quartet of penguins decide to make a break for Antarctica, Marty gets out on the streets of New York City, which forces Alex and the others to rescue him.  Their trip to Grand Central Station is seen by the humans as a quest for freedom and against the will of three of the four friends, they are crated up and put on a ship bound for Africa so they can be happy (the humans who come up with this saw the movie ""Free Willy,"" but never read the news stories about what happened when the star of those films was released into the ocean).To say that they end up in Madagascar rather than Africa might seem like a minor distinction since the island is off the coast of the continent and therefore part of the same land mass, but it is important that the place is NOT Africa.  Africa is a place where there are prides of lions, herds of zebras, and so forth.  Madagascar is a place where there is a division between the lemurs and their small friends, ruled by the wacky Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen), who is advised by the more sedate Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer), and the hyenas, who do not talk, following the tradition of really bad animals in movies populated by talking animals (e.g., the rats in ""Lady and the Tramp"").  This matters because it makes the newcomers the biggest animals around (the ""New York giants"" to the locals), and Alex a true king of the jungle (he terrifies the hyenas when he is not trying to and Julian wants Alex to try really hard to terrify the hyenas).""Madagascar"" is an anti-""Call of the Wild"" in that the biggest conflict becomes not the ability of the zoo animals to survive in the wild or to save the lemurs from the hyenas, but rather keeping Alex from converting to his natural state in which case Marty and the others are literally the walking steaks he misses so much.  Few friendships can survive one friend sinking their teeth into the butt of another, and the tightrope this 2005 animated film must walk is that we have to fear that Alex is going to eat the rest of the cast.  But then we remember, to adapt the wise words of Chandler Bing, that this would just mean they stop drawing the zebra.  However, it is hard to complain about the rhetorical aspects of a film whose chief message is that you should not eat your friends (I bet small kids would get the idea that film is the anti-""Silence of the Lambs"").  Not a classic by any means, but I know how often I laughed out loud, so I have to round up.",4,But what are Mommy and Daddy laughing at?,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,4034,"['Madagascar', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'maddening', 'movie', 'young', 'kids', 'who', 'go', 'parents', 'moments', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'laughing', 'parents', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'kiddies', 'will', 'have', 'clue', 'why', 'how', 'many', 'pre-teens', 'have', 'seen', 'end', 'original', 'version', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'beginnings', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'Chariot', 'Fire', 'have', 'even', 'heard', 'theme', 'song', 'Born', 'Free', 'expect', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'Castaway', 'might', 'well', 'recognize', 'homage', 'dancing', 'hippos', 'Fantasia', 'reasonable', 'think', 'saw', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'Serve', 'Man', 'realize', 'when', 'kids', 'are', 'laughing', 'probably', 'are', 'not', 'aware', 'what', 'parents', 'guardians', 'are', 'doing', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'laughing', 'most', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'other', 'films', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'awrae', 'older', 'people', 'are', 'watching', 'different', 'movie.Ultimately', 'problem', 'different', 'Madagascar', 'grownups', 'are', 'watching', 'clearly', 'funnier', 'one', 'trying', 'keep', 'wee', 'folk', 'entertained', 'story', 'four', 'animals', 'who', 'are', 'best', 'buds', 'Central', 'Park', 'Zoo', 'Alex', 'Lion', 'voiced', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'star', 'show', 'devotee', 'raw', 'steak', 'Marty', 'Zebra', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'tired', 'looking', 'fake', 'jungle', 'painted', 'wall', 'longs', 'be', 'free', 'wild', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'Melman', 'Giraffe', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'hypochondriac', 'worried', 'brown', 'spots', 'skin', 'Gloria', 'Hippo', 'Jada', 'Pinikett', 'Smith', 'rather', 'contented', 'soul', 'when', 'quartet', 'penguins', 'decide', 'make', 'break', 'Antarctica', 'Marty', 'out', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Alex', 'others', 'rescue', 'trip', 'Grand', 'Central', 'Station', 'seen', 'humans', 'quest', 'freedom', 'will', 'three', 'four', 'friends', 'are', 'crated', 'up', 'put', 'ship', 'bound', 'Africa', 'can', 'be', 'happy', 'humans', 'who', 'come', 'up', 'saw', 'movie', 'Free', 'Willy', 'never', 'read', 'news', 'stories', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'star', 'films', 'was', 'released', 'ocean', '.To', 'say', 'end', 'up', 'Madagascar', 'rather', 'Africa', 'might', 'seem', 'minor', 'distinction', 'island', 'coast', 'continent', 'part', 'same', 'land', 'mass', 'important', 'place', 'NOT', 'Africa', 'Africa', 'place', 'where', 'are', 'prides', 'lions', 'herds', 'zebras', 'so', 'forth', 'Madagascar', 'place', 'where', 'division', 'lemurs', 'small', 'friends', 'ruled', 'wacky', 'Julian', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'who', 'advised', 'more', 'sedate', 'Maurice', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'hyenas', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'talk', 'following', 'tradition', 'really', 'bad', 'animals', 'movies', 'populated', 'talking', 'animals', 'e.g.', 'rats', 'Lady', 'Tramp', 'matters', 'newcomers', 'biggest', 'animals', 'New', 'York', 'giants', 'locals', 'Alex', 'true', 'king', 'jungle', 'hyenas', 'when', 'not', 'trying', 'Julian', 'Alex', 'try', 'really', 'hard', 'terrify', 'hyenas', 'Madagascar', 'anti-', 'Call', 'Wild', 'biggest', 'conflict', 'not', 'ability', 'zoo', 'animals', 'survive', 'wild', 'save', 'lemurs', 'hyenas', 'rather', 'keeping', 'Alex', 'converting', 'natural', 'state', 'case', 'Marty', 'others', 'are', 'literally', 'walking', 'steaks', 'so', 'much', 'Few', 'friendships', 'can', 'survive', 'one', 'friend', 'sinking', 'teeth', 'butt', 'tightrope', '2005', 'animated', 'film', 'must', 'walk', 'have', 'fear', 'Alex', 'going', 'eat', 'rest', 'cast', 'then', 'remember', 'adapt', 'wise', 'words', 'Chandler', 'Bing', 'would', 'just', 'mean', 'stop', 'drawing', 'zebra', 'However', 'hard', 'complain', 'rhetorical', 'aspects', 'film', 'chief', 'message', 'should', 'not', 'eat', 'friends', 'bet', 'small', 'kids', 'would', 'get', 'idea', 'film', 'anti-', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Not', 'classic', 'means', 'know', 'how', 'often', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'so', 'have', 'round', 'up']",Madagascar

Granted that the movie has somewhat of a message that revolves around friendship, etc. Dreamworks is less after of an engaging and timeless story and pursuing more of a have-fun-now-and=forget-about-it-later-type tale. And they do a fine job at it! Both of their recent releases have been right on: ""Shark Tale"" did it, but Madagascar is even funnier! In fact, I think it scores easily as the best animated feature of 2005, so far.The voices go very well with the characters, specially Chris Rock (who seems to be able to do any character on this planet). Some of the animation is pretty impressive, such as the way the beach in Madagascar at night came out: very good work! The script is not the most engaging thing on earth, but it's fun. Indeed, as much as the story revolves around these four Zoo buddies you've heard so much about, the four penguins and the lemur king tend to steal the show whenever they show up.Perhaps one of the best things about it is that both, adults and kids, will find something to laugh about and enjoy in the movie, so it doesn't leave either age group out.

And while Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) do catch up with him, it doesn't turn out quite as planned.  Instead, all four of them find themselves headed to Africa.  Will they survive when they get there?I normally steer clear of Dreamworks Animation movies because I find them pale imitations of the Disney Pixar films they are attempting to rip off.  But the previews for the sequel looked so entertaining, I had to give this one a try.  I should have stayed away.Yes, there are a few amusing moments.  I laughed at several of the movie spoofs.  But that was about it.  The story was boring.  The characters had so much potential.  Instead, they went with the easy joke (read bathroom humor) and didn't play out the jokes the premise could have set up.  As many have said, the group of commando penguins are the funniest things in the film, but they don't have nearly enough screen time to make much difference.Then there's the issue of voice casting.  Yes, most of the cast did fine.  But I couldn't get Ross from Friends out of my head whenever Melman had a line.

My 4 year old thought there were lions, giraffes, zebras and hippos on Madagasgar(she wanted to go there to see them :) ).Overall the humor is well done and there are references to other films throughout the movie.

Alex the Lion who's spoiled with grooming and precut steaks; Marty the Zebra who loves his life but yearns for some more, Melman the hypochondriac Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo who acts as a surrogate mother to the other three. From the beginning we see how spoiled these friends are with their every whim filled by their caretakers.They end up packed in crates bound for a African preserve after Marty decides he wants to see ""the wild"" and goes out wandering in the streets of New York. This probably wouldn't have been so bad were it not for his friends deciding to go save him. Lions roaming the streets are a little more serious than Zebras. I didn't appreciate the humour of the NY cop asking his boss if he could shoot the Zebra. Because of unforeseen circumstances they end up severed from the ship, floating in the ocean and finally landing on a tropical paradise.Like any movie there are scene stealers. In this case, it's the four military trained penguins that also have their own Christmas short in the features area. Another scene stealer is an itty bitty lemur named Mort who has Puss-in-boot eyes and a nervous giggle.Obviously not true to life;  the gates are low so the animals can get to one another or at the crowds but then it's not every day you can hear a Zebra, Lion, Giraffe and Hippo talk, dance and sing. Great fun for kids but if the adults are looking for fun they'll only be mildly amused. As always the graphics are great, the music is toe tapping and there is humour. There are a few minute frightening scenes when the animals realize they are not in a Zoo anymore and cute cuddly little beings are being eaten by bigger not so cute ones but this is really short.

Dreamworks Animation release before that Shark Tale wasn't all to great as it went into hip hop rap type thing, and I hope animated movies don't jump ship like Shark Tale.  But Madagascar is a great movie.  My five year old son wanted to see this, so he dragged me along, and I wasn't expecting too much, but to tell you the truth, I enjoyed almost as much as he did, and he LOVED it.  We had to go get Madagascar stuffed animals the next day.  The voices are great, they fit their characters perfect.  Unlike Shark Tale, Martin Scorcese as a blowfish?  David Schwimmer fits Melman perfectly, and Jada Pinkett Smith voices Gloria the Hippo with style.  Ali G is great as King Julian, Cedric The Entertainer is great as Maurice and of coarse, Andy Ritcher provides a cute little voice for Mort, the little cute lemur. Here's the story:Four friends living in the central park zoo, Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty The Zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the Giraff (David Schwimmer)live a carefree life.  On Marty's 10th birthday, he finds out the penguins, who steal every scene their in, are digging to Antarctica, the wild.  Marty decidedes he wants to go to the wild. So one night he escapes.  Alex, Gloria and Melman know he's heading to Grand Central Station to get a train to Cennaticut.  So they go after him, only to be crated up in boxes, and put on route to Africa.  But when those crazy penguins hijack the ship, the four friends fall overboard and wash up on the shore of Madagascar.  When meeting a bunch of partying lemurs, Alex freaks out, while Marty is happy that their in the wild.  The lemurs live life in partying and in worrying, as the dreaded Fossa attack them and rip them limb from lumb as quoted by King Julian.  So they want Alex to protect them, as the Fossa are frightened of Alex, but King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohan aka Ali G)'s sidekick Maurice (Cedric The Entertainer) disagrees with the plan.  Without food though, Alex's instinct is getting the better of him, and Marty may be on the menu for food.It may not have much of a plot, but not many kids movies do.  But, it's a great movie like Shrek and all of Pixar's movies, and provides kids with goofy gags and adults with adult humor that flies right over the kids heads, which make it perfect for adults and kids a like.",5,Dreamworks Animation Redeems Themselves from Shark Tale,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,2395,"['Madagascar', 'funny', 'hip', 'around', 'great', 'movie', 'Animation', 'release', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'went', 'hip', 'hop', 'rap', 'type', 'thing', 'hope', 'animated', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'ship', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'Madagascar', 'great', 'movie', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'wanted', 'see', 'dragged', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'tell', 'truth', 'enjoyed', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'had', 'go', 'get', 'Madagascar', 'stuffed', 'next', 'day', 'voices', 'are', 'great', 'fit', 'characters', 'perfect', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'blowfish', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Melman', 'perfectly', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'voices', 'Gloria', 'Hippo', 'style', 'Ali', 'G', 'great', 'King', 'Julian', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'great', 'Maurice', 'coarse', 'Andy', 'Ritcher', 'cute', 'little', 'voice', 'Mort', 'little', 'cute', 'lemur', 'Here', 'story', 'Four', 'friends', 'living', 'central', 'park', 'zoo', 'Alex', 'Lion', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Marty', 'Zebra', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Gloria', 'Hippo', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'Melman', 'Giraff', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'live', 'carefree', 'life', 'Marty', '10th', 'birthday', 'out', 'penguins', 'who', 'steal', 'scene', 'are', 'digging', 'Antarctica', 'wild', 'Marty', 'go', 'wild', 'So', 'one', 'night', 'Alex', 'Gloria', 'Melman', 'know', 'heading', 'Grand', 'Central', 'Station', 'get', 'train', 'Cennaticut', 'go', 'only', 'be', 'crated', 'up', 'boxes', 'put', 'route', 'Africa', 'when', 'crazy', 'penguins', 'hijack', 'ship', 'four', 'friends', 'fall', 'overboard', 'wash', 'up', 'shore', 'Madagascar', 'When', 'meeting', 'bunch', 'partying', 'lemurs', 'Alex', 'out', 'Marty', 'happy', 'wild', 'lemurs', 'live', 'life', 'partying', 'worrying', 'dreaded', 'Fossa', 'attack', 'rip', 'limb', 'lumb', 'quoted', 'King', 'Julian', 'want', 'Alex', 'protect', 'Fossa', 'are', 'frightened', 'Alex', 'King', 'Julian', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohan', 'Ali', 'G', 'sidekick', 'Maurice', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'plan', 'food', 'Alex', 'instinct', 'getting', 'better', 'Marty', 'may', 'be', 'menu', 'food.It', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'plot', 'not', 'many', 'kids', 'movies', 'do', 'great', 'movie', 'Shrek', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'kids', 'goofy', 'gags', 'adults', 'adult', 'humor', 'flies', 'right', 'kids', 'heads', 'make', 'perfect', 'adults', 'kids', 'like']",Madagascar

Most of these end up behind Pixar's creations as best cartoon of the year.  2005 was one of the few exceptions; first, Pixar did not release any movie that year.  Second, this movie is actually very good.  It tells the story of four overly domesticated zoo animals who inadvertantly end up in Madagascar, where they have to learn to survive against the odds and in spite of themselves.  The movie is written as a comedy with no romance or terror, and some action sequences.  As a comedy, it includes elements of sarcasm, singing, slapstick and a lot of outright stupidity.  Most of the jokes are original and appropriate for all ages, and the animation is quite believable and looks like a cross between the CGI wonders of Pixar and traditional cartoon drawings from the 1960's.  The voiceovers are great, and all the characters are excellent.  Most notable is Sacha Baron Cohen's first big role in a major Hollywood release.  Here, he is the king of a band of lemurs, and his experience from the Da Ali G Show shines through as he sings away in a South Asian accent.Overall, a great movie.

636374,AHF97M45JFCB,B00005JNX0,ONENEO,"[2, 2]","I'll admit that I am a bit partial to talking animal CG animated features.  There is something about the personification of humans in highly stylized animal models that get me every time.  Plus the color pallets are usually spectacular.That said Madagascar was on my ""to do"" list for a long time! 5-years to be exact (never let it be said I rush into things).  I did Disney's The Wild first and both Open Seasons but this one here I held off on figuring it would be the best of the lot.  Did it live up to my expectations? Yes and no.  The look was fantastic, some of the humor worked (others not so much), and the cast was spectacular (Ben Stiller nails it) but it wasn't the laugh-fest I had hyped myself up for 5-years.  But I digress; let's look at the facts, shall we?Madagascar tells of New York's Central Park zoo where a showboating lion, a mid-life crisis suffering zebra, a neurotic giraffe & a bossy hippo do what they do in captivity each day.Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock) realizes that he will likely die within the confines of a cage and decides that he would like to see the wild after a depressing birthday party.His equally pampered friends Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) find themselves forced to escape the zoo as well (a zoo they just so happen not to mind) in effort to track down the runaway zebra.Unfortunately, their attempt at damage control does little more than to persuades zoo officials that captivity is apparently not agreeing with these particular specimens.  They are hence tranquilized and shipped off to live out their years in an animal preserve in Kenya.The plan may have worked too except that it turns out some escaped militant penguins have hijacked the ship in transit to Kenya and, as a result of their desire to check out their native Antarctica, get the animals' shipping crates detoured to the island of Madagascar.  The four unlikely protagonists suddenly find themselves in quite a predicament called surviving in the wild.The plot is pretty tight (enough so for Disney to rip it off in fact) but the biggest flaw here is that the type of puzzle-piece perfection that has become commonplace in Pixar's blockbusters (and even many of DreamWorks') isn't present.  There is a bit of layered humor (the lion's appetite for attention, the penguins' platoon-like behavior, the chimps who are actually scholars and so on) but for every truly brilliant moment, there are an equal number of missed opportunities.  Not the least of which comes in the total miscasting of Jada Pinkett Smith as the giant hippo and David Schwimmer's inability to elevate what should have been sheer hilarity as the hypochondriac giraffe.Chris Rock and Ben Stiller create some natural chemistry however and truthfully, there is enough humor to compliment the unique visuals admirably.  With a brisk 86-minute runtime and a PG rating, the film often feels like it was actually designed to cater to adults over the younger set.In conclusion I fear it's my own expectations that kept this one from earning an even higher rating.  A shame really because all of the pieces are present, it just lacks that little something that pushes this type of project over the top in terms of comedic genius.  As it stands, this one earns a solid 3.5 stars from your truly but since half star ratings are a no-go, I'll round it up to four stars (for the antics of the penguins and monkeys if nothing else).",4,High Expectations May Have Tarnished This One,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,3492,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'am', 'bit', 'partial', 'talking', 'animal', 'CG', 'animated', 'features', 'something', 'personification', 'humans', 'highly', 'stylized', 'animal', 'models', 'get', 'time', 'color', 'pallets', 'are', 'usually', 'spectacular.That', 'said', 'Madagascar', 'was', 'do', 'list', 'long', 'time', '5-years', 'be', 'exact', 'never', 'let', 'be', 'said', 'rush', 'things', 'did', 'Disney', 'Wild', 'first', 'Open', 'Seasons', 'one', 'here', 'held', 'off', 'figuring', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'lot', 'Did', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'Yes', 'look', 'was', 'fantastic', 'humor', 'worked', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'cast', 'was', 'spectacular', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'was', ""n't"", 'laugh-fest', 'had', 'hyped', 'up', '5-years', 'digress', 'let', 'look', 'facts', 'shall', 'Madagascar', 'tells', 'New', 'York', 'Central', 'Park', 'zoo', 'where', 'showboating', 'lion', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'suffering', 'zebra', 'neurotic', 'giraffe', 'bossy', 'hippo', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'captivity', 'day.Marty', 'Zebra', 'voiced', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'will', 'likely', 'die', 'confines', 'cage', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'wild', 'depressing', 'birthday', 'party.His', 'equally', 'pampered', 'friends', 'Alex', 'Lion', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Gloria', 'Hippo', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'Melman', 'Giraffe', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'find', 'forced', 'escape', 'zoo', 'as', 'well', 'zoo', 'just', 'so', 'happen', 'not', 'mind', 'effort', 'track', 'down', 'runaway', 'zebra.Unfortunately', 'attempt', 'damage', 'control', 'little', 'more', 'persuades', 'zoo', 'officials', 'captivity', 'apparently', 'not', 'agreeing', 'particular', 'specimens', 'are', 'hence', 'tranquilized', 'shipped', 'off', 'live', 'out', 'years', 'animal', 'preserve', 'Kenya.The', 'plan', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'too', 'out', 'escaped', 'militant', 'penguins', 'have', 'hijacked', 'ship', 'transit', 'Kenya', 'result', 'desire', 'check', 'out', 'native', 'Antarctica', 'get', 'animals', 'shipping', 'crates', 'detoured', 'island', 'Madagascar', 'four', 'unlikely', 'protagonists', 'suddenly', 'find', 'quite', 'predicament', 'called', 'surviving', 'wild.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'tight', 'enough', 'so', 'Disney', 'rip', 'off', 'fact', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'here', 'type', 'puzzle-piece', 'perfection', 'become', 'commonplace', 'Pixar', 'blockbusters', 'even', 'many', 'DreamWorks', ""n't"", 'present', 'bit', 'layered', 'humor', 'lion', 'appetite', 'attention', 'penguins', 'platoon-like', 'behavior', 'chimps', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'scholars', 'so', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'moment', 'are', 'equal', 'number', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'Not', 'least', 'total', 'miscasting', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'giant', 'hippo', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'inability', 'elevate', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'sheer', 'hilarity', 'hypochondriac', 'giraffe.Chris', 'Rock', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'create', 'natural', 'chemistry', 'however', 'truthfully', 'enough', 'humor', 'compliment', 'unique', 'visuals', 'admirably', 'brisk', '86-minute', 'runtime', 'PG', 'rating', 'film', 'often', 'was', 'actually', 'designed', 'cater', 'adults', 'younger', 'set.In', 'conclusion', 'fear', 'own', 'expectations', 'kept', 'one', 'earning', 'even', 'higher', 'rating', 'shame', 'really', 'pieces', 'are', 'present', 'just', 'little', 'something', 'type', 'project', 'top', 'terms', 'comedic', 'genius', 'one', 'solid', '3.5', 'stars', 'truly', 'half', 'star', 'ratings', 'are', 'no-go', ""'ll"", 'round', 'up', 'four', 'stars', 'antics', 'penguins', 'monkeys', 'nothing', 'else']",Madagascar

I am glad to say that I wasn't disappointed in watching this one as well.`Madagascar' is about four friends, Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith). They are the attractions of the New York Zoo (especially Alex). Marty gets tired of doing the same routine day in and day out, so he thinks of escaping and living in the wild. Alex, Gloria, and Melman think that Marty is crazy to think of such an idea. However, one night they find him missing and look for him around New York City. The animal right activists think that the 4 animals should be shipped to Africa, since they are clearly not adapting to the city life. Put inside 4 boxes, Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria get into a fight and fall off the ship, floating to a nearby island. Will they be able to survive and adapt to a new life in the strange land, occupied by strange animals?Although there is not really much of a storyline to the movie (I mean, they really don't learn any valuable lesson or anything from their trip), it is just funny to see the situations that they encounter themselves in during the whole ride. It was also funny to see the various spoofs they made of different movies like `Saturday Night Fever', `American Beauty', and `Cast Away'. All the 4 main characters provided their voices really well for the movie. Of course, I also loved the lemurs in the movie (especially King Julian and Mort the Mouse) because they really make you laugh out loud. Eric Darnell (who also directed `Antz') and Tom McGrath teamed up and directed this movie wonderfully! But the main credit goes to the animation team. The CGI and special effects used in this movie were so realistic that it shocked me (especially the New York City environment).

636390,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JNX0,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 5]","I have found, over the week since we saw Madagascar, that it's doing something pretty much unheard of in the world of kids' movies: sparking debate. Madagascar is a love-it-or-hate-it experience, it would seem, and the two sides have been debating it at a white-hot pace I haven't seen since a whole bunch of people missed the point of The Blair Witch Project. (Not to start THAT endless debate again.)One of the best things about watching cartoons from the sixties and before was that they weren't just made for kids. I'm not just talking about the odd joke stuck in every once in a while that adults would get and kids wouldn't-- cartoons were not made for kids back in the day. There were more jokes that the adults would get than the kids would. In every cartoon. (And the farther back you go, the more that's true; the kid's grandmother picked up some VHS tapes of cartoon reels from the twenties and thirties at a garage sale a few years back. I think they're hysterical, even when I'm missing about half the jokes because I'm too young and being vaguely offended at the inherent racism in some of them. The kid doesn't get them at all.) Needless to say, if you were to try and make a cartoon like that today, a whole lot of people would think it sucks because, well, it's got too much stuff in it that the kiddies won't get.Enter Madagascar. It is that cartoon. And that has been the point that has, predictably, brought so much fire. I have my suspicions it has drawn such harsh criticism on this topic because there were some jokes that most of the adults didn't get, either (the guy frantically waving the To Serve Lemur book, which I found one of the funniest moments of the movie, occasioned laughs from maybe five people in the packed house where I saw it, and none of the other adults with me go the reference). No one likes to look dumb when his kid asks ""what did that mean?""One of the other complaints about the movie is that it is, essentially, plotless. This is a valid point, but I'm not sure that makes it a valid criticism, especially in an animated feature. Lord knows there have been some recent American animations where the plot and its underlying theme have been so ham-handed that a plotless film is a breath of fresh air (Brother Bear immediately comes to mind). And yes, Madagascar does come off rather like a slightly-less-than-ninety-minute episode of a sitcom. But it's been a long, long time since America came up with a sitcom even remotely as funny as Madagascar-- probably because, again, the jokes in Madagascar are actually aimed at adults a good deal of the time.

636391,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JNX0,Robert Moore,"[4, 7]","I moderately enjoyed this but am starting to be bothered by the tendency of animators to be content with creating films that 1) have no real story and 2) are built around whatever animal characters haven't previously been used in other films.  Though other films have had lions, few or none have featured zebras, hippos, and giraffes.  I can imagine the early concept planning sessions:  ""How about a gerbil?  Has anyone used them before?""  I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that they create the characters for these things first and then construct a story around them.  And that is the problem with this film:  they don't start by creating a great and compelling story.  Contrast this animated film with either of the SHREK films or THE INCREDIBLES.  The latter films have great stories.  Or going farther afield, contrast MADAGASCAR with any of the film by Hayao Miyazaki's masterpieces.  Miyazaki's films are not merely brilliantly animated; they feature magnificent stories.Despite not really having a story, the film is otherwise executed with the kind of panache and sheen that has become standard in the CGI-film.  The characters all look fascinating and are wonderful to look at.  Alex's mane, to cite only one example, with its hundreds of individually articulated strands of fur is stunning.  There isn't a frame in the film that isn't wonderful to gaze at.  And the voice over work and the individual jokes are marvelous to behold.  There just isn't a whole lot of story and what story there is arises from Alex's need to eat.My worry with the contemporary Hollywood animated film, whether CGI or hand drawn (though virtually none seem to be hand drawn these days) is that increasingly story is being neglected for the design of the look of the characters, a long string of in jokes, and the background art.  SHREK had all of these elements as well, but also featured a strong story.  So, a truly intelligent animated film clearly is still possible.  MADAGASCAR features some good characters, lots of good jokes, and looks spectacular, but it just doesn't have much of a story.  I would gladly have given up a few of the jokes for even a halfway decent story.",3,"Looks great and often funny, but not much of a story",1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,2173,"['moderately', 'enjoyed', 'am', 'starting', 'be', 'bothered', 'tendency', 'animators', 'be', 'content', 'creating', 'films', '1', 'have', 'real', 'story', '2', 'are', 'built', 'animal', 'characters', 'have', ""n't"", 'previously', 'been', 'used', 'other', 'films', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'had', 'lions', 'few', 'none', 'have', 'featured', 'zebras', 'hippos', 'giraffes', 'can', 'imagine', 'early', 'concept', 'planning', 'sessions', 'How', 'gerbil', 'Has', 'anyone', 'used', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'create', 'characters', 'things', 'first', 'then', 'construct', 'story', 'problem', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'creating', 'great', 'compelling', 'story', 'Contrast', 'animated', 'film', 'SHREK', 'films', 'INCREDIBLES', 'latter', 'films', 'have', 'great', 'stories', 'going', 'farther', 'afield', 'contrast', 'MADAGASCAR', 'film', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'masterpieces', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'merely', 'brilliantly', 'animated', 'feature', 'magnificent', 'stories.Despite', 'not', 'really', 'having', 'story', 'film', 'otherwise', 'executed', 'kind', 'panache', 'sheen', 'become', 'standard', 'CGI-film', 'characters', 'look', 'fascinating', 'are', 'wonderful', 'look', 'Alex', 'mane', 'cite', 'only', 'one', 'example', 'hundreds', 'individually', 'articulated', 'strands', 'fur', 'stunning', ""n't"", 'frame', 'film', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'gaze', 'voice', 'work', 'individual', 'jokes', 'are', 'marvelous', 'behold', 'just', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'story', 'what', 'story', 'arises', 'Alex', 'need', 'eat.My', 'worry', 'contemporary', 'Hollywood', 'animated', 'film', 'CGI', 'hand', 'drawn', 'virtually', 'none', 'seem', 'be', 'hand', 'drawn', 'days', 'increasingly', 'story', 'being', 'neglected', 'design', 'look', 'characters', 'long', 'string', 'jokes', 'background', 'art', 'SHREK', 'had', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'featured', 'strong', 'story', 'So', 'truly', 'intelligent', 'animated', 'film', 'clearly', 'still', 'possible', 'MADAGASCAR', 'good', 'characters', 'lots', 'good', 'jokes', 'spectacular', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'story', 'would', 'gladly', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'few', 'jokes', 'even', 'halfway', 'decent', 'story']",Madagascar

Zwick,"[3, 6]","In ""Madagascar,"" four animals - a feisty hippo, a neurotic giraffe, an applause-addicted lion, and a freedom-yearning zebra - break out of their home in the Central Park Zoo, get crated up and shipped off to Kenya, and wind up stranded on the island of Madagascar.  While there, they have to adapt to a whole new kind of life in the wild, learning their place in the natural order of things, which is something they`ve been shielded from all their lives.This is a bright, colorful, amiable film with likable characters, first rate animation and fine vocal work from the likes of Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith.  The movie is at its best in the scenes set in Manhattan as the animals roam through the city streets causing terror and havoc as they go.  However, once they arrive back in ""the wild,"" the narrative begins to run out of steam, primarily because the writers have failed to come up with any compelling villain or foil for them to go up against.  There's fun to be had in watching Alex, the highly pampered and civilized lion, getting in touch with his long-dormant and supressed predatory nature, but it isn't enough to make the film much more than a mild diversion.Still, the movie doesn't completely shy away from some of the more brutal truths of nature, without, at the same time, becoming too frightening or disturbing for impressionable youngsters.

It was a thoughtful gift, since my daughter loves animals, and we go to the Portland zoo often, where she falls in love with all the animals all over again.My daughter would probably give ""Madagascar"" five stars . . . but then, she's 2.""Madagascar"" isn't a bad movie per se.  It's just that it is as unsatisfying as one of those summer blockbusters that you go to thinking you're going to see another ""T2,"" or ""Die Hard,"" and you suddenly realize you're watching ""The Phantom.""  Just disappointing.On paper, ""Madagascar"" should be great.  The vocal talents are full of recognized names -- Chris Rock as a freedom-loving zebra, Ben Stiller as a lion with a need to be loved and a submerged carnivore streak (he only belatedly realizes where steak comes from), David Schwimmer as a wimpy giraffe, and Jada Pinkett Smith as a voluptuous hippo make for an interesting headline.But these folks, as talented as they are, fall flat. You can almost see Ben Stiller reading his lines in the studio, and Chris Rock, bless him, is poorly suited for this saccharine role.  (If anyone ever makes a rated 'R' Pixar-type movie with harsh language and biting satire, Rock should be the first actor signed, but here he's more hand-cuffed than when he hosted the Oscars.)Without giving too much away, the plot of ""Madagascar"" is fairly simple.  Several animals in the Central Park Zoo in relative tranquility, and Alex the Lion particularly loves being the centerpiece of the entire production.  But Marty the Zebra has turned 10, so he's in the middle of a mid-life crisis -- the zoo is great, but is that all there is (and is this really a plot kids can relate to?).  Marty tries to escape to ""the Wild,"" of Connecticut, but this escapade and his friends' botched attempt to save Marty deposits the friends on the ""wild"" island of Madagascar.  Of course, when they get to Madagascar, the animals learn that life without room service is much more challenging than they thought.  (This difficulty is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the zebra, apparently, is capable of building colossal shelters out of bamboo and fronds, complete with sunlights.)There's also the subplot about the carnivores and the herbivores learning about the whole ""circle of life"" the hard way.  It's hard for lifelong friends to hang out when they learn that one of them is supposed to, you know, eat the other one.The City Animals also run into a bunch of lemur-like creatures, who are led by a most-annoying king Julien who has a most-annoying tendency to speak in malapropisms and to sing hip-hop doggerel.  (While my two-year old daughter loved ""I Like to Move it Move It,"" all the adults in earshot found this song considerably annoying after its first appearance.)""Madagascar"" should make us sit back and reflect on just how majestic both Shrek and the Pixar family of films (""Incredibles,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" etc.) are.  These movies transcend their genre of computer-generated cartoons and qualify as great movies in their own right.  These stories are inspired by a great deal of wit as well as respect for the story-telling process.

636403,A32GGQEOYSAGGA,B00005JNX0,S. Hedberg,"[2, 3]","Dreamwork's adventuresome comedy Madagascar must to doing something right to show up Star Wars: Episode III at the box office.  Unlike much of their prior work, Madagascar is not plagued by an abundance of pop culture references (though there are still a few) and unoriginal ideas.  Dreamworks still has a long way to go before it will overcome Pixar, but they seem to close the gap a little this time around.The story is simple enough for anyone to understand, but it possesses a few proverbial thoughts that grant the movie some deeper meaning.  [Warning: Spoilers Ahead]  Marty, an adventuresome zebra, realizes that his life in the Central Park Zoo is monotonous and repetitive.  He longs for more and sets out, due to the inspiration from a group of clever penguins, to journey into the wild.  Alex, Gloria, and Melman (A lion, hippo, and giraffe respectively) attempt to stop him, and they are apprehended along with Marty and the penguins at Central Park Subway Station.  The animals are then shipped to a wildlife reserve in Kenya, Africa.  The penguins, however, have other plans.  They knock the captain and his crew members unconscious and take over the ship.  When they turn it around, the crates containing Alex, Gloria, Marty, and Melman are tossed overboard, and they end up on Madagascar.  Once there, the animals attempt to cope with surviving the wild, and although Marty has little trouble, the others realize what they've lost and loathe the experience.  Things become more complicated when Alex begins to submit to his predatorial instincts and has delusions about his friends becoming steaks.  King Julian (a ridiculously awesome lemur) plans to use Alex to rid the lemurs of the Foosa (I think they're hyenas) who disturb the Lemurs by ""trespassing, wrecking our parties, and tearing our limbs off,"" as King Julian puts it.  In the end, both conflicts are resolved when the penguins make an unexpected visit to the island with the ship.  The animals plan to depart, but all the ship's fuel is gone.  Thus, the movie ends without anyone knowing what fate will befall the animals on Madagascar.  After the events of the story, the viewer is under the impression that despite this complication, they will all be able to survive together without any trouble.Stylistically, Madagascar is must more cartoonish in appearance that other CG productions.  This works well because the humor is primarily based on traditional cartoon gags (impossible stretching of the body, painful crashes and tumbles, unexpected hits from heavy objects, etc.).  Often times, the humor from complete chaos-so many characters doing so many ridiculous things in an incredibly short span of time that one can't help but be amused.  This type of animation seems more fluid and natural than what Pixar usually does-movies like Shark Tale and Shrek usually come off ans visually pathetic imitations of Pixar's work.  This movie isn't as striking as Pixar's work, but it is fitting to the movie and superior to Dreamwork's other productions.The most notable aspect of the movie is the characters.  Marty and Alex, being the main characters, are complex and subject to change throughout the movie.  Gloria and Melman provide substantial support to them and deeply add to the comic value (Melman's character seems to have been created almost solely for this purpose).  The lemurs themselves are ridiculous but incredibly fun to watch, and the narcisistic King Julian is a real treat (""I Like to move it, move it"").  Of course, the penguins steal the show when they are on screen.  Their chemistry is fantastic, and they are the primary catalysts when it comes to the plot (After all, they are the one's that create the primary problem and also help solve it).  The cast provides the movie with a wide range of appeal, and it shines primarily because of that.On of the only films of 2005 that is not a remake or sequel, Madagascar breaks new ground in the animation world and stands as Dreamwork's best work.  Though there is still room for improvement in both the animation and execution, one will certainly not leave the theatre disappointed in this film.",4,Dreamwork's Best Effort to Date (4.5/5),1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,4143,"['Dreamwork', 'adventuresome', 'comedy', 'Madagascar', 'must', 'doing', 'something', 'right', 'show', 'up', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'III', 'box', 'office', 'much', 'prior', 'work', 'Madagascar', 'not', 'plagued', 'abundance', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'unoriginal', 'ideas', 'Dreamworks', 'still', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'will', 'overcome', 'Pixar', 'seem', 'close', 'gap', 'little', 'time', 'around.The', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'anyone', 'understand', 'few', 'proverbial', 'thoughts', 'grant', 'movie', 'deeper', 'meaning', '[', 'Warning', 'Spoilers', 'Ahead', ']', 'Marty', 'adventuresome', 'zebra', 'life', 'Central', 'Park', 'Zoo', 'monotonous', 'repetitive', 'more', 'out', 'due', 'inspiration', 'group', 'clever', 'penguins', 'journey', 'wild', 'Alex', 'Gloria', 'Melman', 'lion', 'hippo', 'giraffe', 'respectively', 'attempt', 'stop', 'are', 'apprehended', 'Marty', 'penguins', 'Central', 'Park', 'Subway', 'Station', 'animals', 'are', 'then', 'shipped', 'wildlife', 'reserve', 'Kenya', 'Africa', 'penguins', 'however', 'have', 'other', 'plans', 'knock', 'captain', 'crew', 'members', 'unconscious', 'take', 'over', 'ship', 'When', 'turn', 'around', 'crates', 'containing', 'Alex', 'Gloria', 'Marty', 'Melman', 'are', 'tossed', 'overboard', 'end', 'up', 'Madagascar', 'Once', 'there', 'animals', 'attempt', 'cope', 'surviving', 'wild', 'Marty', 'little', 'trouble', 'others', 'realize', 'what', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'experience', 'become', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Alex', 'submit', 'predatorial', 'instincts', 'delusions', 'friends', 'becoming', 'steaks', 'King', 'Julian', 'ridiculously', 'awesome', 'lemur', 'use', 'Alex', 'rid', 'lemurs', 'Foosa', 'think', ""'re"", 'hyenas', 'who', 'disturb', 'Lemurs', 'trespassing', 'wrecking', 'parties', 'tearing', 'limbs', 'off', 'King', 'Julian', 'end', 'conflicts', 'are', 'resolved', 'when', 'penguins', 'make', 'unexpected', 'visit', 'island', 'ship', 'animals', 'plan', 'depart', 'ship', 'fuel', 'gone', 'Thus', 'movie', 'anyone', 'knowing', 'what', 'fate', 'will', 'befall', 'animals', 'Madagascar', 'events', 'story', 'viewer', 'impression', 'complication', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'survive', 'together', 'trouble.Stylistically', 'Madagascar', 'must', 'more', 'cartoonish', 'appearance', 'other', 'CG', 'productions', 'well', 'humor', 'primarily', 'based', 'traditional', 'cartoon', 'gags', 'impossible', 'stretching', 'body', 'painful', 'crashes', 'tumbles', 'unexpected', 'hits', 'heavy', 'objects', 'etc.', 'Often', 'humor', 'complete', 'chaos-so', 'many', 'characters', 'doing', 'so', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'incredibly', 'short', 'span', 'time', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'amused', 'type', 'animation', 'more', 'fluid', 'natural', 'what', 'Pixar', 'usually', 'does-movies', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'Shrek', 'usually', 'come', 'off', 'ans', 'visually', 'pathetic', 'imitations', 'Pixar', 'work', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'striking', 'Pixar', 'work', 'fitting', 'movie', 'superior', 'Dreamwork', 'other', 'productions.The', 'most', 'notable', 'aspect', 'movie', 'characters', 'Marty', 'Alex', 'being', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'subject', 'change', 'movie', 'Gloria', 'Melman', 'provide', 'substantial', 'support', 'deeply', 'add', 'comic', 'value', 'Melman', 'character', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'almost', 'solely', 'purpose', 'lemurs', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'watch', 'narcisistic', 'King', 'Julian', 'real', 'treat', 'move', 'move', 'course', 'penguins', 'steal', 'show', 'when', 'are', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'fantastic', 'are', 'primary', 'catalysts', 'when', 'plot', 'are', 'one', 'create', 'primary', 'problem', 'also', 'help', 'solve', 'cast', 'movie', 'wide', 'range', 'appeal', 'primarily', 'that.On', 'only', 'films', '2005', 'not', 'remake', 'sequel', 'Madagascar', 'new', 'ground', 'animation', 'world', 'Dreamwork', 'best', 'work', 'still', 'room', 'improvement', 'animation', 'execution', 'one', 'will', 'certainly', 'not', 'leave', 'theatre', 'disappointed', 'film']",Madagascar

636410,A24PVVTV5PQKRM,B00005JNX0,Sonia Nat,"[1, 1]","I must admit to not being a fan of the Dreamworks animations. They don't look particularly inventive, the voice talent is often at best distracting, or at worst, poor, and the stories are very sparse.  Madagascar really is no exception to the rule. We first meet the heroes of the film - the animals - at the New York Zoo. Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) is a zebra bored with captivity and longing for the freedom of the wild. Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller) is a vain yet cowardly lion, happy to pose for the public in his cage, and so full of himself that he buys Marty little icons of himself as birthday presents. Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer) is a hypochondriac giraffe, while Gloria the hippo (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith) is an earth momma, keeping her pals in check.  There is a also a small mafia of penguins in the zoo who want to go to Antarctica. These are funny and inventive characters, but a little at odds with the rest of the film.  This film has its moments - the animals going on the subway to Grand Central Station; the squirrels and chipmunks who rule the island of Madagascar (the wild Marty is so keen on); and the film and TV references - Hawaii Five O, Born Free, Chariots of Fire, American Beauty, and more.  But the characters are two-dimensional, the script is needlessly childish (yes, I know it is for kids, but give them some credit for having brains), and the film is pretty pointless, other than the same old 'you've got a friend' theme that pervades almost every film from the studio.

David Schimmer is in close competition with Ben Stiller as most annoying animated animal ever.  Jada Pinkett Smith is fine, but her character is really just an afterthought.  As a matter of fact, the whole movie is.  The writers must have thought of the concept about zoo animals returning to the wild and missing the luxuries of their former, caged environments, and thought they had a humdinger, because they didn't put much more thought into it than that.  The whole plot doesn't even really get started until near the end when Alex realizs in the wild that he'd rather eat Marty the Zebra than talk to him.  All of this would have seemed more charming if it weren't so lamely done.  My daughter, I should mention, loved it, and the animation was good.

When it works, it really works: ""Toy Story"" (1 and 2), ""Ice Age"", ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Lion King"".  When it doesn't work, as is the case here, it's all too obvious.  ""Madagascar"" takes far too long to get to where we all know it's going, and when it gets there very little happens.  The ""friendship vs. instinct"" theme is superficially explored in the character of Alex the Lion, but it isn't sufficiently connected to the rest of the story.  What's missing is a strong villain, and a point: sure our four friends want to get home, but there isn't much they can - or do - actually do about it, is there?  Fortunately, ""Madagascar"" is almost saved by the strength of the vocal performances - Sacha Baron Cohen, as King Julien in particular - and the antics of the minor characters.  The lemurs and the penguins save the day, in more ways than one.

636424,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00005JNX0,Terry Mesnard,"[1, 1]","You have to hand it to Dreamworks for trying to compete with the behemoth that is Pixar.  In making Shrek, they managed to put their foot into a genre that has since been filled with mostly Pixar movies, with the occasional Ice Age by Fox.  And yet, Dreamworks CG animation works by incorporating adult-style humor with kiddie humor.  They did this remarkably well with Shrek 1&2 and almost succeed as well with Madagascar.The casting is spot-on.  Each actor, from Ben Stiller's frenetic Alex to Chris Rock's white or black challenged zebra to even David Schwimmer's (a person I can't usually stand) hypochondriac of a giraffe to Jada Pinkett Smith's motherly hippo, are a treat visually as well as aurally.  Perhaps the standout of the bunch for me was the self-professed lemur king voiced to perfection by Sacha Baron Cohen who some may realize is Ali G (among others) in Da Ali G Show.  He shows himself to be a vocal chameleon in the same way that Hank Azaria is.Sight gags and double entendres abound in this PG rated flick, and most of the adult humor will go over the kids heads.  One occasion is where the word sh*t is said by using a word for s, a word for h, etc etc in a pretty clever way.  One wonders, however, if this is stretching the limits of what can be in a PG rated children flick.The one faltering point for me is the story.  Four screenwriter's worked on the script and usually this means that the story will not be very good.  What usually happens is that the different screenwriters will take the story in four different directions and you have a muddled story.  Thankfully, Madagascar is pretty much saved from this.  It seemed a little thrown together in places, though.The story kept bouncing around as to what it was about.  Is it about the relationship of Alex the tiger and Marty the Zebra who should be enemies?  Is it about Marty's desire to be in the wild?  Is it about Lemurs who have a predator problem?  And speaking of which, who is the antagonist?  Who is the protagonist?  At times it seems like it should be Alex but at others it was Marty.  I was trying to get a clear picture of who was the main character and usually failed.  It just was not as cohesive as some of the other animated flicks that have been out right now and I think it hurt the overall pacing.  The humor also had a lot of frenetic, slap-stick style to it.  I can't count how many times someone stepped on something, ran into something, fell down on something or did a combination of some or all of the above.Overall, however, this was a good film.  It was funny, generally witty and often-times a great film.  Personally, I wish the story stayed with one of the themes mentioned above.  Particularly the story between Alex and Marty, tiger and Zebra who, in the wild, would not be friends.  At the end, it seemed as if this was the predominant theme and the point the film makers were getting across.  I just don't think they hit the mark as well as they could have.  And it's really a shame, some of the best moments happen toward the film's end.

Seay,"[1, 8]","In recent years we have become accustomed to animated films that entertain children and adults: Shrek, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, etc.  This film attempts the same but, more likely than not, it will disappoint both young and old alike.The idea is promising.  A group of New York zoo animals embark, willingly or not, on an adventure in the wild.  The buildup to their departure is actually the funniest part of the movie.  Reflecting the sentiment of many city-dwellers (who might take an eco-tourist vacation) the zebra longs to leave his pampered, cloistered life in the zoo to get back to his ""primordial"", wild roots.Several of his fellow zoo-mates chase after the Zebra and all find themselves in the madagascarian jungle, where the brutal realities of the jungle present themselves: namely, you must kill, be killed, or at least run fast enough to avoid the latter. This is where the film goes flat.  The escaped lion starts seeing his friends as steaks but eventually resigns himself to eating fish. That's it!  The whole second half of the film is built around that concept and that is not enough to hold our attention.  I noticed that my three year old started fidgeting and lost interest in the film at around the same time as I.There are some funny scenes in the movie; the key is to go with lower expectations than the trailers may have inspired.",3,Born to Be Mild,1117411200,"05 30, 2005",2005,1359,"['recent', 'years', 'have', 'become', 'accustomed', 'animated', 'films', 'entertain', 'children', 'adults', 'Shrek', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Incredibles', 'etc', 'film', 'same', 'more', 'likely', 'not', 'will', 'disappoint', 'young', 'old', 'alike.The', 'idea', 'promising', 'group', 'New', 'York', 'zoo', 'animals', 'embark', 'willingly', 'not', 'adventure', 'wild', 'buildup', 'departure', 'actually', 'funniest', 'part', 'movie', 'Reflecting', 'sentiment', 'many', 'city-dwellers', 'who', 'might', 'take', 'eco-tourist', 'vacation', 'zebra', 'longs', 'leave', 'pampered', 'cloistered', 'life', 'zoo', 'get', 'back', 'primordial', 'wild', 'roots.Several', 'fellow', 'zoo-mates', 'chase', 'Zebra', 'find', 'madagascarian', 'jungle', 'where', 'brutal', 'realities', 'jungle', 'present', 'namely', 'must', 'kill', 'be', 'killed', 'least', 'run', 'fast', 'enough', 'avoid', 'latter', 'where', 'film', 'flat', 'escaped', 'lion', 'seeing', 'friends', 'steaks', 'eventually', 'eating', 'fish', 'whole', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'built', 'concept', 'not', 'enough', 'hold', 'attention', 'noticed', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'started', 'fidgeting', 'lost', 'interest', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'I.There', 'are', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie', 'key', 'go', 'lower', 'expectations', 'trailers', 'may', 'have', 'inspired']",Madagascar
636428,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JNX0,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[25, 31]","Recent animated efforts have tried to create 3-D characters and environments, but the filmmakers have wisely chosen another course for ""Madagascar"". Adopting a stylized form of animation, the film looks like a living picture book. Everything is cartoonier than we are used to. Alex, Marty and Melman are still rendered in 3-D, but they are not lifelike and appear to be adapted from a children's book, actually adding to the humor. These characters look like stuffed animals and its funny to watch little kids carrying a small toy of Alex home after their visit to the zoo. They seem more believable as zoo animals and they are certainly cute as the dickens.In all animated films today, a certain level of irreverence, of zaniness is expected. ""Madagascar"" doesn't reach the heights of the ""Shrek"" films, but it comes darn close. Everything from Tom Wolfe to ""The Twilight Zone"", ""American Beauty"" to ""The Planet of the Apes"" is parodied in the film. Most of the kids won't get these jokes and the filmmakers know that. They are included for the adults, to keep them interested in the story. The mark of a great animated film is if both adults and children enjoy the experience. For instance, ""The Incredibles"" was a fantastic blend of story, action, character and humor which will continue to delight people of all ages. ""Madagascar"" has a very funny story, great characters, and a lot of humor. On a couple of occasions, the story was a little slow, but I think all of the other areas more than compensate for any shortcomings. And adults will laugh at many of the jokes, probably more so than the kids in the audience.Ben Stiller and Chris Rock are very good. David Schwimmer seems to be injecting a lot of Ross from ""Friends"" into the role of Melman, not very original but it works. The real standouts are Tom McGrath and Sacha Baron Cohen.There are a couple of brilliant additions to the film, which help it rise above. Marty's ideas of visiting the wild are originally fed by Skipper the Penguin (Tom McGrath). Skipper and his sidekicks, two other penguins, are determined to break out of the zoo and return to Antarctica. They skulk around corners like CIA operatives, act in clandestine ways, and manage to accomplish most of their goals. The penguins are a brilliant addition to the story and really liven up the proceedings. I laughed out loud during most of their appearances. For a while, their story takes them in a different direction from the rest of the gang and we lose track of them. Because they are so funny, you long for their return.When the animals land in Madagascar, they meet King Julian the lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen, TV's ""Ali G"") and Maurice, his right hand lemur (Cedric the Entertainer) and their entire kingdom of lemurs. Cohen seemed to be channeling the spirit of Peter Sellers, because his voice was an uncanny reproduction of some of Seller's characters. He is very funny as the King, always working on an angle as he tries to figure things out. The Lemurs add a level of frenetic activity and zaniness to the film, ratcheting the humor up a few notches.The least interesting voice actor is Jada Pinkett Smith. She simply doesn't add anything to the character. IMDb.com lists a handful of other people who were considered for the role and I have to say that I don't think any of them would have made a significant contribution either. A comedian would have been a nice touch. Instead, Gloria seems to be the lone voice of reason among the group, dragging everything down.""Madagascar"" is a really good, very funny film suitable for the entire family. But it is also a great choice if you are with a date or simply alone and want to watch a funny film.

636429,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JNX0,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","One great thing about ""Madagascar"" is its computer graffic images by Dreamworks (to be precise, PDI/Dreamworks).  The colors are delightful to see, and the movement of the characters are very natural (and rightly exaggerated when they need to provide laughs).  The voice talents by Ben Stiller, Jada Pinckett Smith, Chris Rock, and David Schwimmer are reasonably engaging.OK, I said good things first, because there are as many bad things in the film.  The film's weak script (by four writers) has no reasonable story at all.  We see a lion, a hippo, a giraffe, and a zebra, all spoiled in a comfy life in a well-managed, amusement-park-type zoo at Central Park, New York City, living like celebrities.  And ... that's all.  What's funny about it?In fact, that's the first act, followed by the second one, in which they are sent to Madagascar (an island off the coast of Africa).  And?  Nothing special, except for some manic turns from the group of lemur (and its king).  And very, very poor ending as if someone has forgoten that a film needs what we call ending.  (And what happened to the two monkeys that should be still on the ship?)[BEST PRIZE -- THE PENGUINS] The cliched buddy-buddy relations between Rock's fast-talking zebra and Stiller's lion is totally overshadowed by another truly fantastic cretures, four military-commando-like penguins, WHO SHOULD BE THE MAIN CHARACTERS of the film.  They are really funny, and more importantly, they know what they are doing while the other four animals are just meandering in the all-too-familiar episodes.  If Dreamworks should think of the sequel (and probably they are doing right now after watching the staggering commercial success of the film), make the penguins the hero of the film.  And don't forget to include equally funny King of Lemur Julien by Sacha Baron Cohen, aka Ali G.Without duobt, younger audiences find the film funny for it is full of slapstick jokes, and adults may be amused by some of the parodies (of 'Cast Away' 'Planet of the Apes' and many others).  But if we talk about the characters and story, we know 'Madagascar' proves that Hollywood needs filmmakers who take animated films more seriously, and can make a feature film of animation without using recycled music numbers, repeated (too obvious) parodies, and a cliched story.

Marty (Chris Rock) is a zebra that after his 10th birthday suffers from a mid-life crisis and wants to be free. His closest friends; Alex (Ben Stiller) the lion, Melman (David Schwimmer--doing his best acting of his career) the giraffe, and Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) the Hippo try to get him to see how good their life is, but Marty just can't be convinced. He breaks out, as do the zoo's penguins, and tries to get to Africa. Instead, they end up on a Pacific isle somewhere that is largely inhabited by lemurs. The friendship between the quartet becomes estranged but faces the ultimate test when Alex (in an idea stolen from Bruce the Shark in Pixar's FINDING NEMO) begins giving into his carnal instincts and attacks Marty. Can a lion and zebra, two natural enemies, remain friends when they are no longer confined to captivity?With that said, they real reason you want to see MADAGASCAR is because of the penguins. The penguins who escape from the zoo are a top-notch unit of military commandos. They seem to have been original put in the film for comic relief, but upstage all the other characters and are the real stars of this animated flick. Another secondary character worth mentioning is the lemur king, Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen). Cohen has been a popular comedienne only known to a small audience for many years. MADAGASCAR opened his talents to a wider audience and paved the wave for his further success as the villain in TALLADEGA NIGHTS. MADAGASCAR may become known as the breakout film for Cohen.Though it's not quite on the level of a Pixar picture or the SHREK films, MADAGASCAR is better than much of the animated drivel that the studios are mass-producing currently.

636434,AID8OJP77VK6Y,B00005JNX0,unicornelia,"[5, 12]","I saw the trailers for this and they were enough to tell me what each of the characters was like. I hoped and expected that the film itself would give me more; it really didn't. Most of the time, animated movies stand a good chance of giving me something to love about them even when, overall, they may not be so great. ""Shark Tale,"" for instance, never got the best reviews, but there's just something I love about it, despite the fact that I know it's not the best CG movie made. With ""Madagascar,"" all I can say is that I chuckled a few times. The characters all seemed very clich&eacute; (there had to be the four friends--a hypochondriac, a smooth-talking joker who gets everyone in trouble, the joker's friend who's a bit of a ham but has slightly more brains, and a girl.) But I could tell all that from the trailers; I wanted something more that I never got. They are cute animals, I admit, but the movie is so entirely focused on the jokes, the humor, the references, that it completely lacks any kind of development, seriousness, or anything that would be powerful. Even when Alex discovers his inner predator, it goes by so fast that you don't feel much. And again, the humor is what the movie counts on to survive. And I honestly can't say that I would be interested in seeing it a second time, because the humor was not *that* hilarious. The penguins? Yes, they were somewhat amusing. But again, it was nothing more than what I expected from the trailers; and I didn't really expect much. The lemurs, while definitely funny, also didn't add a lot to the film besides humor. And they were the only native animals we really got to know. I also didn't care for the overly unrealistic animation style. I don't need photorealism, but if they're going to make Alex walk like a human and pose like a human in front of humans, well...there was nothing there to convince me that this was an animal character.Once I realized that the movie wasn't going to turn into anything amazing, I stopped waiting for the greatness and just tried to enjoy the very, very simple story that it had. I suppose I did, but again, I wouldn't recommend it or exactly choose to rewatch it myself. In the end, it's not clear whether they returned to Central Park Zoo or not, since apparently the boat was out of gas. A cliffhanger like that is fine, I guess, but the movie didn't make me care enough about it to really appreciate that ending...nor do I eagerly anticipate a sequel. Overall, I felt the story itself was pretty simple (which in itself isn't a bad thing at all), but the way it was presented left much to be desired. It was carried all on the jokes, and nothing surprising or clever ever jumped out at me and pulled me into it. I suppose I could compare it to an extended TV cartoon. There's no question for me that Pixar's films, and almost all of Dreamworks' others, especially ""Shark Tale,"" are superior to ""Madagascar."" This movie, unfortunately, never exceeded the fairly low expectations I had set for it. Because it was a CG, animal-centric film, I figured that it couldn't possibly fail. But sadly, there was very little substance to it and I came away rather indifferent. I felt there was clumsiness in the way it was put together, carelessness in the making, and I do remember that at some point I began wondering when it was just going to be over.Also...what was the moral? The city zoo was made out to be a tiny place where wild animals were kept in pens, surrounded by skyscrapers, and gawked at by people...but they were mostly happy there because of the pampering, health care, etc. And in the end they seemingly decide to do a bit of travel, then return to the zoo as long as they're together. I wasn't sure whether they were trying to say that the animals belonged in the wild, or that they couldn't inhabit it once they were in captivity for so long, or what. So I again concluded that the movie's only real point was to be lighthearted and full of jokes, jokes, jokes. Which was okay. I just didn't like it enough to want to see it again or to recommend it to others. It had potential, but came across as flat, redundant, or just generally not worthwhile.",2,Nothing special.,1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,4170,"['saw', 'trailers', 'were', 'enough', 'tell', 'what', 'characters', 'was', 'hoped', 'expected', 'film', 'would', 'give', 'more', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'Most', 'time', 'animated', 'movies', 'stand', 'good', 'chance', 'giving', 'something', 'love', 'even', 'when', 'overall', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'great', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'instance', 'never', 'got', 'best', 'reviews', 'just', 'something', 'love', 'fact', 'know', 'not', 'best', 'CG', 'movie', 'made', 'Madagascar', 'can', 'say', 'chuckled', 'few', 'times', 'characters', 'seemed', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'had', 'be', 'four', 'friends', 'hypochondriac', 'smooth-talking', 'joker', 'who', 'everyone', 'trouble', 'joker', 'friend', 'who', 'bit', 'ham', 'slightly', 'more', 'brains', 'girl', 'could', 'tell', 'trailers', 'wanted', 'something', 'more', 'never', 'got', 'are', 'cute', 'animals', 'admit', 'movie', 'so', 'entirely', 'focused', 'jokes', 'humor', 'references', 'completely', 'kind', 'development', 'seriousness', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'powerful', 'Even', 'when', 'Alex', 'inner', 'predator', 'fast', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'much', 'again', 'humor', 'what', 'movie', 'survive', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'second', 'time', 'humor', 'was', 'not', '*that*', 'hilarious', 'penguins', 'Yes', 'were', 'somewhat', 'amusing', 'again', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'what', 'expected', 'trailers', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'much', 'lemurs', 'definitely', 'funny', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'lot', 'film', 'humor', 'were', 'only', 'native', 'animals', 'really', 'got', 'know', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'overly', 'unrealistic', 'animation', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'photorealism', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'Alex', 'walk', 'human', 'pose', 'human', 'front', 'humans', 'well', 'was', 'nothing', 'there', 'convince', 'was', 'animal', 'character.Once', 'realized', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'turn', 'anything', 'amazing', 'stopped', 'waiting', 'greatness', 'just', 'tried', 'enjoy', 'very', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'had', 'suppose', 'did', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'exactly', 'choose', 'rewatch', 'end', 'not', 'clear', 'returned', 'Central', 'Park', 'Zoo', 'not', 'apparently', 'boat', 'was', 'gas', 'cliffhanger', 'fine', 'guess', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'care', 'enough', 'really', 'appreciate', 'ending', 'do', 'eagerly', 'anticipate', 'sequel', 'Overall', 'felt', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'simple', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'way', 'was', 'presented', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'was', 'carried', 'jokes', 'nothing', 'surprising', 'clever', 'ever', 'jumped', 'out', 'pulled', 'suppose', 'could', 'compare', 'extended', 'TV', 'cartoon', 'question', 'Pixar', 'films', 'almost', 'Dreamworks', 'others', 'especially', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'are', 'superior', 'Madagascar', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'exceeded', 'fairly', 'low', 'expectations', 'had', 'set', 'was', 'CG', 'animal-centric', 'film', 'figured', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'fail', 'sadly', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'substance', 'came', 'away', 'rather', 'indifferent', 'felt', 'was', 'clumsiness', 'way', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'carelessness', 'making', 'do', 'remember', 'point', 'began', 'wondering', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'over.Also', 'what', 'was', 'moral', 'city', 'zoo', 'was', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'tiny', 'place', 'where', 'wild', 'animals', 'were', 'kept', 'pens', 'surrounded', 'skyscrapers', 'gawked', 'people', 'were', 'mostly', 'happy', 'there', 'pampering', 'health', 'care', 'etc', 'end', 'seemingly', 'decide', 'do', 'bit', 'travel', 'then', 'return', 'zoo', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'together', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'were', 'trying', 'say', 'animals', 'belonged', 'wild', 'could', ""n't"", 'inhabit', 'once', 'were', 'captivity', 'so', 'long', 'what', 'So', 'again', 'concluded', 'movie', 'only', 'real', 'point', 'was', 'be', 'lighthearted', 'full', 'jokes', 'jokes', 'jokes', 'Which', 'was', 'okay', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'enough', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'recommend', 'others', 'had', 'potential', 'came', 'flat', 'redundant', 'just', 'generally', 'not', 'worthwhile']",Madagascar

That is from the same studio that made Shrek and Shrek 2, which were both excellent movies.  Because of this, I was pretty confident that I would at least enjoy Madagascar a little bit.  I was wrong.The biggest problem was with the plot.  It dragged on and on.  The movie seemed 4 hours long to me because it went so slow.  I didn't find any of the jokes to be funny either.I also had a problem with the CGI animation.  In Shrek, it seemed like at times you could mistake the characters for being real.  In Madagascar, it was far from that.  The animation was grainy, and seemed to step back to some early CGI movies that made the big screen and didn't live up to todays standards.Or perhaps the problem was with Ben Stiller.  He was the voice of Alex the Lion in the movie.  It seems like I have never seen a Ben Stiller movie that I have liked.

636441,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B00005JNX0,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[7, 9]","Madagascar is the story of 4 zoo animals in Central Park (a lion, a giraffe, a hippo, and a zebra) that find themselves, through various twists of fate, on an island in the middle of the ocean. No more cages, no more zoo. But also no more free food or people to take care of them. (Neither of those ideas is really examined all that much in the film, just briefly mentioned).The animation is a bit blocky and the plot is a bit thin, but I'm sure it will entertain kids. The problem is that in this day and age we expect our animated films to do more than mindlessly entertain our children, we expect to be entertained as well. Unfortunately, Madagascar does not meet those expectations.Despite the big names this animated film boasts (Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Cedric the Entertainer, Sacha Baron Cohen) the film feels a bit lackluster. That's partly due to the fact that none of these actors (Baron Cohen aside) know how to create a feasible character voice. These are name actors paid to sound like themselves. But a zebra with Chris Rock's voice is not entertaining, it's actually kind of annoying. The same goes for a giraffe with David Schwimmer's voice and a hippo with Smith's voice. Ben Stiller doesn't put forth much effort, but his lion, Alex, at least has a bit of character mixed in there. Sacha Baron Cohen definitely steals the film with his lemur-king Julien, but unfortunately he doesn't show up until halfway through the film.The roll of the credits featuring Baron Cohen's Julien chanting ""I like to move it move it!"" is probably the most exciting and inspired part of the entire film.
