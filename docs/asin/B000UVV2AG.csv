But this is my second time falling for the photo shop, up to date promo cover. The first time it happened with ""Spirited Killer"", and Tony was barely in that as well, this movie...... I'm use to horrible Dubbing, but this movie, I was done with the movie, when the big Australian dude came into the picture and when he started talking, they gave him a voice of what sounded like a(n) old asian man that spoke broken english.

Unfortunately, it is even worse than Spirited Killer.  The story is not really worth going over.  Basically there is some guy who knows where a valuable stone is.  An evil General and his men want the stone and are trying to get it.  There is also a group of good guys trying to find the guy who knows where the stone is.  That is the story.Tony Jaa plays one of the bad guys and looks pretty good in his 2 fight scenes, but all of the other fights are really bad.  Some of the stunts are good, but not on par with most of Panna Rittikrai's other movies.  The good guys have a Rambo type person on their side and he kind of drags the movie down because his movements are very slow.  But overall the main reason this movie is so bad is because there aren't many fights.  I can stand a bad story as long as the fights are good, but this movie doesn't provide that.  Even the big finale isn't worth sticking around for.  Thre are some decent explosions, but nothing to get excited about.Rating- 1/5.  This movie really makes you appreciate how much effort was put into Panna's 2 Born to Fight movies.Picture quality is surprisingly good (well, good for Videoasia).  There is a HORRIBLE English dub track, but luckily there is also an original language track and subtitles.The only reason this 2-disc DVD set gets more than a 1 star rating is because of the special features.4 minute interview with Tony Jaa talking about Tom Yum Goong.  No new information here, but while he is talking they show a really cool demonstration he did on some TV show.6 minute interview with Jaa talking about his inspiration for getting into films and a few other interesting topics.10 minute interview on some Thai comedy TV show with Prachya Pinkaew, Jaa, Panna, and Petchtai Wongkamlao.  Mildly entertaining.5 minute demonstration and interview that Jaa did in Hong Kong.  Good stuff here, but nothing you haven't seen before if you are a Jaa fan.22 minute interview with the producer of Pechpanna Films and a director/actor for the company.  Awesome interview!  They talk about some really cool stuff, such as a new Thai movie called The Brave.  It isn't subtitled and the dubbing is really cheesy, but that actually makes it more enjoyable (to me at least).  And there are some good action scenes mixed into the interview.3 minute Tony Jaa interview.  It seems like they are just trying to pile on the special features with this.  Only thing to talk about is a 1 minute demo they show at the end of the interview.Last but not least is an interview with Christoph Kluppel who is a big German Rambo guy that stars in Battle Warrior.  He talks about his film career.  I suppose this would be interesting if I was a fan of him.",2,"Very bad cheesy movie, and Tony Jaa is barely in it",1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,2808,"['being', 'majorly', 'disappointed', 'Spirited', 'Killer', 'set', 'expectations', 'much', 'lower', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'worse', 'Spirited', 'Killer', 'story', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'going', 'Basically', 'guy', 'who', 'where', 'valuable', 'stone', 'evil', 'General', 'men', 'want', 'stone', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'also', 'group', 'good', 'guys', 'trying', 'find', 'guy', 'who', 'where', 'stone', 'story.Tony', 'Jaa', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'pretty', 'good', '2', 'fight', 'scenes', 'other', 'fights', 'are', 'really', 'bad', 'stunts', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'par', 'most', 'Panna', 'Rittikrai', 'other', 'movies', 'good', 'guys', 'have', 'Rambo', 'type', 'person', 'side', 'kind', 'drags', 'movie', 'down', 'movements', 'are', 'very', 'slow', 'overall', 'main', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'fights', 'can', 'stand', 'bad', 'story', 'as', 'long', 'fights', 'are', 'good', 'movie', ""n't"", 'provide', 'Even', 'big', 'finale', ""n't"", 'worth', 'sticking', 'Thre', 'are', 'decent', 'explosions', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'about.Rating-', '1/5', 'movie', 'really', 'appreciate', 'how', 'much', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'Panna', '2', 'Born', 'Fight', 'movies.Picture', 'quality', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'well', 'good', 'Videoasia', 'HORRIBLE', 'English', 'dub', 'track', 'luckily', 'also', 'original', 'language', 'track', 'subtitles.The', 'only', 'reason', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'more', '1', 'star', 'rating', 'special', 'features.4', 'minute', 'interview', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'talking', 'Tom', 'Yum', 'Goong', 'No', 'new', 'information', 'here', 'talking', 'show', 'really', 'cool', 'demonstration', 'did', 'TV', 'show.6', 'minute', 'interview', 'Jaa', 'talking', 'inspiration', 'getting', 'films', 'few', 'other', 'interesting', 'topics.10', 'minute', 'interview', 'Thai', 'comedy', 'TV', 'show', 'Prachya', 'Pinkaew', 'Jaa', 'Panna', 'Petchtai', 'Wongkamlao', 'Mildly', 'entertaining.5', 'minute', 'demonstration', 'interview', 'Jaa', 'did', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Good', 'stuff', 'here', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'are', 'Jaa', 'fan.22', 'minute', 'interview', 'producer', 'Pechpanna', 'Films', 'director/actor', 'company', 'Awesome', 'interview', 'talk', 'really', 'cool', 'stuff', 'such', 'new', 'Thai', 'movie', 'called', 'Brave', ""n't"", 'subtitled', 'dubbing', 'really', 'cheesy', 'actually', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'least', 'are', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'mixed', 'interview.3', 'minute', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'interview', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'pile', 'special', 'features', 'Only', 'thing', 'talk', '1', 'minute', 'demo', 'show', 'end', 'interview.Last', 'not', 'least', 'interview', 'Christoph', 'Kluppel', 'who', 'big', 'German', 'Rambo', 'guy', 'Battle', 'Warrior', 'film', 'career', 'suppose', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'was', 'fan']",Battle Warrior
