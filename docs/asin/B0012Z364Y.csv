Some scary scenes, but nothing graphic. A good evening's entertainment!",4,Interesting movie about the mystical legend,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,255,"['really', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'much', 'Cry', 'when', 'watched', 'advance', 'copy', 'film', 'was', 'definitely', 'better', 'expected', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'legend', 'La', 'Llorona', 'scary', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'graphic', 'good', 'evening', 'entertainment']",The Cry
1139741,A3I3051BZDJWGU,B0012Z364Y,Diane C. Howard,"[6, 6]","I found the last scene hokey and stupid (what La Llorona says). I wound up saying ""Oh, come ON!"" out loud. And the curandera's decision, though foreshadowed earlier on, annoyed me. I wanted a conquering heroine.The film itself isn't bad for a first-time indy filmmaker. But I didn't realize that the original drowning was what those flashes were. There were too many flashes to keep track of for me.To those who don't like it, please don't sell this film short -- remember that it is is a first film. And thank you, Bernadine for NOT making it a slasher film! Although part of me wishes there had been a segment on how La Llorona got to NYC, the truth is, the legend exists anywhere there are hispanics, so I guess it doesn't matter. But I would have enjoyed it more if it hadn't seemed so much like I was walking into the middle of a story with no beginning or end.I guess didn't like it much, because I wanted something a bit more -- well, more. But I really did like the extras (the legends, modern youth telling how they remember La Llorona, and a director's short). And I wouldn't mind having this in my library.I was living in New Mexico, just north of El Paso, Texas when I first heard the story of La Llorona (in the 80s). It was a vague story, and I wanted to know more. That's why I rented this movie. I'm not sorry I did. If this is a first film, and the director does films about what she loves, she's going to be great. I think I'd like to see a series of La Llorona films, and see how she develops using the same theme. Not a series like Freddy Krueger Part XXVII or anything. Just remake the same film with a different vantage point or a bit more plot or character development. That would be interesting to me but probably dull to everyone else. Well, I like Brussels Sprouts and not everyone else does, so to each his own.",3,Okay but leaves a bit to be desired,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,1838,"['found', 'last', 'scene', 'hokey', 'stupid', 'what', 'La', 'Llorona', 'wound', 'up', 'saying', 'Oh', 'come', 'ON', 'out', 'loud', 'curandera', 'decision', 'foreshadowed', 'earlier', 'wanted', 'conquering', 'heroine.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'first-time', 'indy', 'filmmaker', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'original', 'drowning', 'was', 'what', 'flashes', 'were', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'flashes', 'keep', 'track', 'me.To', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'sell', 'film', 'short', 'remember', 'first', 'film', 'thank', 'Bernadine', 'NOT', 'making', 'slasher', 'film', 'part', 'had', 'been', 'segment', 'how', 'La', 'Llorona', 'got', 'NYC', 'truth', 'legend', 'anywhere', 'are', 'hispanics', 'guess', ""n't"", 'matter', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'had', ""n't"", 'seemed', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'walking', 'middle', 'story', 'beginning', 'end.I', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'wanted', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'well', 'more', 'really', 'did', 'extras', 'legends', 'modern', 'youth', 'telling', 'how', 'remember', 'La', 'Llorona', 'director', 'short', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'having', 'library.I', 'was', 'living', 'New', 'Mexico', 'just', 'north', 'El', 'Paso', 'Texas', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'story', 'La', 'Llorona', '80s', 'was', 'vague', 'story', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'why', 'rented', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sorry', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'films', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'think', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'series', 'La', 'Llorona', 'films', 'see', 'how', 'using', 'same', 'theme', 'Not', 'series', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'Part', 'XXVII', 'anything', 'Just', 'remake', 'same', 'film', 'different', 'vantage', 'point', 'bit', 'more', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'probably', 'dull', 'everyone', 'else', 'Well', 'like', 'Brussels', 'Sprouts', 'not', 'everyone', 'else', 'so', 'own']",The Cry

However, to be fair, I think the actors went out of their way in this film, which is the only reason why I didn't stop the movie halfway through. I kept thinking it was going to get better but it only got progressively worse.The big disappointment for me was the fact that they never showed what this crying woman looked like. You see what she sees through her eyes, sort of like how Laura Mars saw what the killer was seeing in The Eyes of Laura Mars.Bottom line: don't waste your time or your money.
