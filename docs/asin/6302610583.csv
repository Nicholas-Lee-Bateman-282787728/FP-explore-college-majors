A time of self awareness and emotions like love, anger, jealousy and that yearning to belong, to be cool. Also one of recklessness. These strong feelings and actions are brought to the forefront by three close friend actors.  Actor Russell Crowe displays his burgeoning talent with his one-time girlfriend Danielle Spencer and best friend Robert Mammone, who he will later star with in &quot;Heaven's Burning.&quot;  This film is simple but powerful in its simplicity. Being a teenager is not easy and the actors give a credible performance using their talent and their youth itself to portray this difficult age.  &quot;The Crossing&quot; is a faithfull reflection about young passions and first love.",4,No frills in &quot;The Crossing&quot;,999302400,"09 1, 2001",2001,763,"['movie', 'almost', 'everyone', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'time', 'self', 'awareness', 'emotions', 'love', 'anger', 'jealousy', 'yearning', 'belong', 'be', 'cool', 'Also', 'one', 'recklessness', 'strong', 'feelings', 'actions', 'are', 'brought', 'forefront', 'three', 'close', 'friend', 'actors', 'Actor', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'burgeoning', 'talent', 'one-time', 'girlfriend', 'Danielle', 'Spencer', 'best', 'friend', 'Robert', 'Mammone', 'who', 'will', 'later', 'star', 'quot', 'Heaven', 'Burning.', 'quot', 'film', 'simple', 'powerful', 'simplicity', 'Being', 'teenager', 'not', 'easy', 'actors', 'give', 'credible', 'performance', 'using', 'talent', 'youth', 'portray', 'difficult', 'age', 'quot', 'Crossing', 'quot', 'faithfull', 'reflection', 'young', 'passions', 'first', 'love']",The Crossing VHS
322740,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6302610583,Deborah Earle,"[5, 6]","Having watched the real-life coverage of the wedding of Danielle Spencer and Russell Crowe, I must say that I felt truly happy for them both, and I wish them success at their marriage.As for the movie that introduced the couple, it's rather bland, but then this is probably a realistic view of life in a small Australian town.It's rather hard to place the exact year in which the story takes place but it appears to be around 1965 when men like the stylish looking Robert Mammone would have grown their hair out a bit more. Mammone, is very handsome with his chiseled and intense looking features. As the potential love interest and rival of Russell Crowe, whose emotions range from staid to explosive, Mammone is strikingly sophisticated.As the center of the love triangle, Spencer is pretty staid at times. But she is convincing as the country girl who has trouble making the heady decision awaiting her.The scenes between the originally established couple are racy, but considering the real-life romance of the two leads, a sign of things to come.We see the family lives of the three main characters and of those around them. Most of the supporting players appear frustrated with their lives, and lamenting past mistakes, especially the elders in the story, whereas the young boldly take chances and do what they must to make their lives more exciting and distinguished.The story ends with the heroine Meg trying to stop the feud between her rival suitors, and a frightening and fateful accident that will alter certain choices that had to be made.This movie is highly reflective of the youthful culture it depicts, and the youth and inexperience of the actors is self evident. But in the years since, viewers have seen them improve.",3,A Predictable Screenplay With A Positive Real-Life Outcome,1057276800,"07 4, 2003",2003,1736,"['Having', 'watched', 'real-life', 'coverage', 'wedding', 'Danielle', 'Spencer', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'must', 'say', 'felt', 'truly', 'happy', 'wish', 'success', 'marriage.As', 'movie', 'introduced', 'couple', 'rather', 'bland', 'then', 'probably', 'realistic', 'view', 'life', 'small', 'Australian', 'town.It', 'rather', 'hard', 'place', 'exact', 'year', 'story', 'place', 'be', '1965', 'when', 'men', 'stylish', 'looking', 'Robert', 'Mammone', 'would', 'have', 'grown', 'hair', 'bit', 'more', 'Mammone', 'very', 'handsome', 'chiseled', 'intense', 'looking', 'features', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'rival', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'emotions', 'range', 'staid', 'explosive', 'Mammone', 'strikingly', 'sophisticated.As', 'center', 'love', 'triangle', 'Spencer', 'pretty', 'staid', 'times', 'convincing', 'country', 'girl', 'who', 'trouble', 'making', 'heady', 'decision', 'awaiting', 'her.The', 'scenes', 'originally', 'established', 'couple', 'are', 'racy', 'considering', 'real-life', 'romance', 'two', 'leads', 'sign', 'things', 'come.We', 'see', 'family', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Most', 'supporting', 'players', 'appear', 'frustrated', 'lives', 'lamenting', 'past', 'mistakes', 'especially', 'elders', 'story', 'young', 'boldly', 'take', 'chances', 'do', 'what', 'must', 'make', 'lives', 'more', 'exciting', 'distinguished.The', 'story', 'heroine', 'Meg', 'trying', 'stop', 'feud', 'rival', 'suitors', 'frightening', 'fateful', 'accident', 'will', 'alter', 'certain', 'choices', 'had', 'be', 'made.This', 'movie', 'highly', 'reflective', 'youthful', 'culture', 'youth', 'inexperience', 'actors', 'self', 'evident', 'years', 'viewers', 'have', 'seen', 'improve']",The Crossing VHS
