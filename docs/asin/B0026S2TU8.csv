1252063,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0026S2TU8,Andrew Ellington,"[9, 23]","I want to get a couple of things off my chest before I get into my review of the FILM.  I don't think there is another life story that has moved me as much as that of Brad Cohen.  I remember very vividly when I first heard his name.  It was a few years ago.  I had just gotten home from work and I was getting ready to meet my wife for dinner.  I had switched on the television for some noise while I got dressed and Oprah happened to be on.  Her guest that day was Brad Cohen and I found myself sitting on the couch in tears while I listened to his story.  In fact, I was so moved by his strength and determination that I went to his website, got his email, and sent him an email telling him how much he encouraged and inspired me.I've never EVER done anything like that before, and I don't think I ever will again.So, when I saw that this film had been made and that it was going to be playing on television I instantly set my DVR.  I had no idea that this came out in 2008 (I just saw it this past weekend), but if I had known I would have seen it earlier.  I knew going in that it was a Hallmark film, so I had a feeling that it wouldn't really do him justice (Hollywood take note, this story needs to be told on the big screen with a real grit and realism, PLEASE!), but I was excited nonetheless.Now, I'll get to my feelings on the film.The first thing I noticed was the narration.  I wasn't a fan.  The narration of a film can make or break it really, and it only works some of the time.  I think the best use of protagonist narration I've seen in recent films was in `About Schmidt', but that is really the exception, not the rule.  Narration is unnecessary and distracting, and in some cases even corny.I could see `upbeat inspiration' written all over this film, which for me was kind of overdone.  I really applaud Cohen for his outlook on life and the way he has been able to become such a positive role model for so many, but when telling a story of this nature their needs to be a sense of dramatic tension.  I didn't really find that here.  I could see they were trying in some areas (Cohen's breakdown in the car was especially effective, but that was one of those moments I also remembered from his Oprah interview and so I was already emotionally attached to that moment), but overall it seemed to miss the boat there.The acting was VERY hit and miss, and I blame a lot of this on the script as well, which was so cookie cutter `screenwriting 101' that it gave me a headache in areas.  Jimmy Wolk handles every tick and noise with so much authentic realism you never doubt for a moment that he has Tourette's.  My issue with his performance comes from the overuse of the ticks and noises (he does them every 3 seconds almost and it comes off as not only distracting but unrealistic) and the fact that he has to muddle through some cringe worthy dialog and situations.  The whole father/son side plot to the film is horribly written and acted.  His relationship with his father comes across as nothing but a stereotype, with no real emotion or realism and the confrontations and fights they have about work especially come over as cheesy and unnatural.  Treat Williams has some nice moments, especially with Dominic Scott Kay, but in the later scenes with Wolk he suffers from the same choppy dialog.  Patricia Heaton is not a dramatic actress, and it shows.  She is, by far, worst here and just cringe worthy, soap opera fake in moments.  I really thought that Sarah Drew was luminescent and just so endearing as Nancy, the girl who steals Brad's heart.  She is so natural, and she truly brings out the best in Wolk, who shines when sharing the screen with her.The overall feel of this film is far too `made for television' for my taste.  It feels cheep in scenes and just kind of cheesy.  I hate saying this.  I wanted to just rave this film.  I even told my wife that it felt like I was watching a bad sitcom at times.In the end I really love this story, but I felt that the film was a missed opportunity.  I'm very happy that Cohen's story has been told and I hope that many more people see this film, read his book and get inspired by his story.  I just also hope and pray that this story is told on the big screen with a capable script so that we can really EXPERIENCE the power of Cohen's inspirational message.BTW, this film still made me cry (I'm such a softy), so I guess that means that it still is moving!",3,"I applaud the man, not the film...",1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,4434,"['want', 'get', 'couple', 'things', 'chest', 'get', 'review', 'FILM', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'life', 'story', 'moved', 'as', 'much', 'Brad', 'Cohen', 'remember', 'very', 'vividly', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'name', 'was', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'just', 'gotten', 'home', 'work', 'was', 'getting', 'ready', 'meet', 'wife', 'dinner', 'had', 'switched', 'television', 'noise', 'got', 'dressed', 'Oprah', 'happened', 'be', 'guest', 'day', 'was', 'Brad', 'Cohen', 'found', 'sitting', 'couch', 'tears', 'listened', 'story', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'strength', 'determination', 'went', 'website', 'got', 'email', 'sent', 'email', 'telling', 'how', 'much', 'encouraged', 'inspired', 'me.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'EVER', 'done', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'will', 'again.So', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'playing', 'television', 'instantly', 'set', 'DVR', 'had', 'idea', 'came', 'out', '2008', 'just', 'saw', 'past', 'weekend', 'had', 'known', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'earlier', 'knew', 'going', 'was', 'Hallmark', 'film', 'had', 'feeling', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'justice', 'Hollywood', 'take', 'note', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'big', 'screen', 'real', 'grit', 'realism', 'PLEASE', 'was', 'excited', 'nonetheless.Now', ""'ll"", 'get', 'feelings', 'film.The', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'narration', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'narration', 'film', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'really', 'only', 'time', 'think', 'best', 'use', 'protagonist', 'narration', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'films', 'was', 'Schmidt', 'really', 'exception', 'not', 'rule', 'Narration', 'unnecessary', 'distracting', 'cases', 'even', 'corny.I', 'could', 'see', 'upbeat', 'inspiration', 'written', 'film', 'was', 'kind', 'overdone', 'really', 'applaud', 'Cohen', 'outlook', 'life', 'way', 'been', 'able', 'become', 'such', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'so', 'many', 'when', 'telling', 'story', 'nature', 'needs', 'be', 'sense', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'here', 'could', 'see', 'were', 'trying', 'areas', 'Cohen', 'breakdown', 'car', 'was', 'especially', 'effective', 'was', 'one', 'moments', 'also', 'remembered', 'Oprah', 'interview', 'so', 'was', 'already', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'moment', 'overall', 'seemed', 'miss', 'boat', 'there.The', 'acting', 'was', 'VERY', 'hit', 'miss', 'blame', 'lot', 'script', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'so', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'screenwriting', '101', 'gave', 'headache', 'areas', 'Jimmy', 'Wolk', 'tick', 'noise', 'so', 'much', 'authentic', 'realism', 'never', 'doubt', 'moment', 'Tourette', 'issue', 'performance', 'overuse', 'ticks', 'noises', '3', 'seconds', 'almost', 'off', 'not', 'only', 'distracting', 'unrealistic', 'fact', 'muddle', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'dialog', 'situations', 'whole', 'father/son', 'side', 'plot', 'film', 'horribly', 'written', 'acted', 'relationship', 'father', 'across', 'nothing', 'stereotype', 'real', 'emotion', 'realism', 'confrontations', 'fights', 'have', 'work', 'especially', 'come', 'over', 'cheesy', 'unnatural', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'nice', 'moments', 'especially', 'Dominic', 'Scott', 'Kay', 'later', 'scenes', 'Wolk', 'same', 'choppy', 'dialog', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'not', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'far', 'worst', 'here', 'just', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'soap', 'opera', 'fake', 'moments', 'really', 'thought', 'Sarah', 'Drew', 'was', 'luminescent', 'just', 'so', 'endearing', 'Nancy', 'girl', 'who', 'Brad', 'heart', 'so', 'natural', 'truly', 'out', 'best', 'Wolk', 'who', 'shines', 'when', 'sharing', 'screen', 'her.The', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'made', 'television', 'taste', 'cheep', 'scenes', 'just', 'kind', 'cheesy', 'hate', 'saying', 'wanted', 'just', 'rave', 'film', 'even', 'told', 'wife', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'bad', 'sitcom', 'end', 'really', 'love', 'story', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'Cohen', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'hope', 'many', 'more', 'people', 'see', 'film', 'read', 'book', 'get', 'inspired', 'story', 'just', 'also', 'hope', 'pray', 'story', 'told', 'big', 'screen', 'capable', 'script', 'so', 'can', 'really', 'EXPERIENCE', 'power', 'Cohen', 'inspirational', 'message.BTW', 'film', 'still', 'made', 'cry', ""'m"", 'such', 'softy', 'so', 'guess', 'still', 'moving']",Front of the Class (Hallmark Hall of Fame: Gold Crown Collector's Edition)

He grew up with no friends and endured constant name calling because of his disability from his peers, until a principal cared enough to educate his school during a school musical performance. That day things turned around for Brad and people started helping him cope with his disability better. He fell in love with being in Georgia when he was a camp counselor. He tried constantly to find a job in Georgia to match his heart's desire of teaching; he was rejected a lot but kept moving forward trying to find a place where he could be accepted and make a difference in the lives of the students.

But the constant encouragement of a mother who refused to give up on her son and the support (finally) of an educator who believed in him, lead him to believe in himself.

Burroughs ""Mike in SA""","[6, 6]","A dear friend told me two days ago that this movie was going to be on TV tonight (6 Feb 10), so I knew that I had to watch it--and I'm very glad that I did. A few times, I cried because I have been plagued with Tourette Syndrome (TS) since about 1953, when I was eight years old. Perhaps many people will be able to gain some understanding about TS from this extremely well done movie. We are not freaks; we just have a disability over which we have no control, and for which medical science has not yet been able to develop a cure. I greatly admire Mr. Cohen for his optimism and perseverance, despite all the obstacles he had to face over the years. Many people would likely have just given up. Yet he turned what may seem to have been a liability into a powerful tool to help him become an overcomer and, more importantly, a super achiever.Interestingly, I wanted to be a teacher myself from the time I was about 15, so I finally had an opportunity to be one in the Air Force for two years (1980-1982). Regrettably, there is no doubt in my mind that TS had an adverse impact on my performance. It wasn't until about 1981 or 1982 that I even became aware that there was a name for what I had. While that in and of itself did not help alleviate my condition, I at least knew something about it and came to realize that I wasn't alone.If you have TS or know someone who does, this movie should have a very profound and positive impact on you. Even if you do not or do not know anyone with TS and have a chance to see it, I urge you to do so. It is well worth the time--as, I should add, is true with all Hallmark movies. >&lt;>",5,Wonderful and Inspiring,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,1627,"['dear', 'friend', 'told', 'two', 'days', 'ago', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'TV', 'tonight', '6', 'Feb', '10', 'so', 'knew', 'had', 'watch', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'A', 'few', 'times', 'cried', 'have', 'been', 'plagued', 'Tourette', 'Syndrome', 'TS', '1953', 'when', 'was', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'Perhaps', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'gain', 'understanding', 'TS', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'freaks', 'just', 'have', 'disability', 'have', 'control', 'medical', 'science', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'able', 'develop', 'cure', 'greatly', 'admire', 'Mr.', 'Cohen', 'optimism', 'perseverance', 'obstacles', 'had', 'face', 'years', 'Many', 'people', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'just', 'given', 'up', 'turned', 'what', 'may', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'liability', 'powerful', 'tool', 'help', 'become', 'overcomer', 'more', 'importantly', 'super', 'achiever.Interestingly', 'wanted', 'be', 'teacher', 'time', 'was', 'about', '15', 'so', 'finally', 'had', 'opportunity', 'be', 'one', 'Air', 'Force', 'two', 'years', '1980-1982', 'Regrettably', 'doubt', 'mind', 'TS', 'had', 'adverse', 'impact', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", '1981', '1982', 'even', 'became', 'aware', 'was', 'name', 'what', 'had', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'alleviate', 'condition', 'least', 'knew', 'something', 'came', 'realize', 'was', ""n't"", 'alone.If', 'have', 'TS', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'very', 'profound', 'positive', 'impact', 'Even', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'anyone', 'TS', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'urge', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'time', 'should', 'add', 'true', 'Hallmark', 'movies', '>', 'lt']",Front of the Class (Hallmark Hall of Fame: Gold Crown Collector's Edition)

Years ago I saw a crime drama on TV (I forget which one) about a teenager who loved movies, but his uncontrollable yelps, etc., ruined the movie for a bunch of bullies, who subsequently beat him to death. Ignorance and confusion will always affect those with Tourettes, as well as those who encounter such people.I have always been plagued by Tourettes, in a very mild form. I've always been a confident person, ready to handle most things, including performing on-stage. My college days, my early 20's, somehow brought out the worst of it, with the twitches and yelps. (This was back in the early 70's). People can be so cruel. ""Front of the Class"" must be the penultimate film ever to not only reveal the torment of Tourettes, but to explain the differences between the many varying forms of this ""syndrome"". My own problem has somewhat dissipated, with rare, minor re-occurances. Still, I can't forget the cruelty to which I was subjected, and other people's comments about those with Tourettes who shout random obscenities, and scream, etc. ""Front of the Class"" explains that those are ""forms"" of Tourettes that do not affect all ""victims"".
