1136248,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001298BPY,Andrew Ellington,"[9, 10]","One of those films that hits me in many layers, `Ordet' covers so many touchy yet pertinent subjects that it's truly difficult to review and or even discuss this film in one shot.  So, I'm warning you now, this review may wind up feeling incomplete.  The more I consider, meditate and talk about this film the more I appreciate it and the more I uncover.  So, it's safe to say that tomorrow, next week and even next year I'll have something new to add to this review (but I refuse to amend my reviews, so you'll sadly never see those `new' additions).A film that really challenges all I think I know and feel, `Ordet' is an experience that can be difficult to swallow for some.A lot of European films in the 50's and 60's (think Ingmar Bergman) dealt with faith and the effect that religion had and still has on humanity in general.  Dreyer's `Ordet' is no exception.  The film centers around a family struggling with their religious individuality.  The family's patriarch, Morten, finds that his personal convictions are tested when his youngest son falls in love with a girl belonging to a family steeped in religious beliefs that conflict with Morten's.  Morten's eldest son, Mikkel, has all but lost faith in god and Morten's other son, Johannes, believes he is the Christ himself.I have a certain connection with this film for the reason that my fleshly brother wound up developing the same mental illness as Johannes.  I think that is why I felt this strong presence while watching this film, because I could see the religious abrasiveness weighing heavy on Johannes actions, as a way to brutally and directly rebel against his father.  Growing up in a very religious family, I saw my brother (half-brother who apparently felt discarded by my father) use religious rebellion as a way to hurt my father, eventually compromising my father's spiritual standing by proclaiming to be the very entity my father held on such high esteem.It's crushing to watch.The film strips many layers away from religion in general, examining the idea of cross-contamination so-to-speak (as in, religious mixing in the marital arrangement) and even the feeling or need to convert those around us, even for apparently selfish reasons.As the film unfolds there are a series of tragic events that uncover the inner person in each individual and bring together a certain sense of acceptance between these two families, and more importantly, between Morten and his sons.  It is a shocking, preposterous yet completely affirming conclusion to this truly remarkable example of pristine (and heartfelt) filmmaking.All performances here are stellar, but the one that really moved me the most was that of Henrick Malberg, who played Morten.  His understanding of his character's convictions was just overwhelming (in a very good way).  Preben Lerdorff Rye understood the crazy without drowning out the humanity within his actions, and the brilliant Birgitte Federspiel just marvels here as Inger, the doomed daughter-in-law who only wants to see her family come together in a unity that only her life can bring.If you are looking for a film that is bound to challenge you in ways you will feel for days, weeks and years to come then this is a movie you NEED TO SEE.",5,Peel away the truth behind your faith...,1261440000,"12 22, 2009",2009,3240,"['One', 'films', 'many', 'layers', 'Ordet', 'covers', 'so', 'many', 'touchy', 'yet', 'pertinent', 'subjects', 'truly', 'difficult', 'review', 'even', 'discuss', 'film', 'one', 'shot', 'So', ""'m"", 'warning', 'now', 'review', 'may', 'wind', 'up', 'feeling', 'incomplete', 'more', 'consider', 'meditate', 'talk', 'film', 'more', 'appreciate', 'more', 'uncover', 'So', 'safe', 'say', 'tomorrow', 'next', 'week', 'even', 'next', 'year', ""'ll"", 'have', 'something', 'new', 'add', 'review', 'refuse', 'amend', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'sadly', 'never', 'see', 'new', 'additions', '.A', 'film', 'really', 'think', 'know', 'feel', 'Ordet', 'experience', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'some.A', 'lot', 'European', 'films', '50', '60', 'think', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'dealt', 'faith', 'effect', 'religion', 'had', 'still', 'humanity', 'general', 'Dreyer', 'Ordet', 'exception', 'film', 'centers', 'family', 'struggling', 'religious', 'individuality', 'family', 'patriarch', 'Morten', 'personal', 'convictions', 'are', 'tested', 'when', 'youngest', 'son', 'love', 'girl', 'belonging', 'family', 'steeped', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'conflict', 'Morten', 'Morten', 'eldest', 'son', 'Mikkel', 'lost', 'faith', 'god', 'Morten', 'other', 'son', 'Johannes', 'Christ', 'himself.I', 'have', 'certain', 'connection', 'film', 'reason', 'fleshly', 'brother', 'wound', 'up', 'developing', 'same', 'mental', 'illness', 'Johannes', 'think', 'why', 'felt', 'strong', 'presence', 'watching', 'film', 'could', 'see', 'religious', 'abrasiveness', 'weighing', 'heavy', 'Johannes', 'actions', 'way', 'brutally', 'directly', 'rebel', 'father', 'Growing', 'up', 'very', 'religious', 'family', 'saw', 'brother', 'half-brother', 'who', 'apparently', 'felt', 'discarded', 'father', 'use', 'religious', 'rebellion', 'way', 'hurt', 'father', 'eventually', 'compromising', 'father', 'spiritual', 'standing', 'proclaiming', 'be', 'very', 'entity', 'father', 'held', 'such', 'high', 'esteem.It', 'crushing', 'watch.The', 'film', 'strips', 'many', 'layers', 'away', 'religion', 'general', 'examining', 'idea', 'cross-contamination', 'so-to-speak', 'religious', 'mixing', 'marital', 'arrangement', 'even', 'feeling', 'need', 'convert', 'even', 'apparently', 'selfish', 'reasons.As', 'film', 'are', 'series', 'tragic', 'events', 'uncover', 'inner', 'person', 'individual', 'bring', 'together', 'certain', 'sense', 'acceptance', 'two', 'families', 'more', 'importantly', 'Morten', 'sons', 'shocking', 'preposterous', 'yet', 'completely', 'affirming', 'conclusion', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'example', 'pristine', 'heartfelt', 'filmmaking.All', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'stellar', 'one', 'really', 'moved', 'most', 'was', 'Henrick', 'Malberg', 'who', 'played', 'Morten', 'understanding', 'character', 'convictions', 'was', 'just', 'overwhelming', 'very', 'good', 'way', 'Preben', 'Lerdorff', 'Rye', 'understood', 'crazy', 'drowning', 'out', 'humanity', 'actions', 'brilliant', 'Birgitte', 'Federspiel', 'just', 'marvels', 'here', 'Inger', 'doomed', 'daughter-in-law', 'who', 'only', 'see', 'family', 'come', 'together', 'unity', 'only', 'life', 'can', 'bring.If', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'bound', 'challenge', 'ways', 'will', 'feel', 'days', 'weeks', 'years', 'come', 'then', 'movie', 'NEED', 'SEE']",ORDET Carl Theodor Dreyer 1955

1136250,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B001298BPY,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[5, 14]","Denmark's Carl Theodor Dreyer was one of the great auteurs of early cinema, and such masterpieces as Vampyr and Day Of Wrath attest to that fact. Many critics, however, have hailed either his earlier silent film, The Passion Of Joan Of Arc, or his later Ordet (The Word) as his greatest work, and while I've never seen the earlier film in a full restoration, having just watched Ordet I can say, uncategorically, that it is not in a league with Vampyr nor Day Of Wrath. This is not to say that the film is a bad one, but it is nowhere near a great one.... Ordet is not even a direct allegory on evil and complicity with it, as was the earlier Day Of Wrath, made during the occupation. In fact, it is not really an allegory at all, merely a simple tale of faith, and a none too original one, at that. Its ending is telegraphed all throughout the film. Its ultimate message, about the power of faith over strict rationality, is also not a new one, and its rendering here is not in the least powerful. Compared to, say, Ingmar Bergman's Winter Light, made only a few years later, this film pales in every measure of comparison. That later film was loaded with vitality, even as it was a despairing film. Despite this film's seemingly upbeat ending (resurrection is a good thing, right?), it has none of the verve nor power Bergman's film has. Its characters never resonate with the viewer the way Bergman's tormented pastor and his scorned lover do, in their anomic faith and intellect, and their probing of it. Nor were Munk nor Dreyer the writers that Bergman is. And, compared to Day Of Wrath's ending, wherein that film's female protagonist's descent, into the insanity of feeling she has become a witch, haunts a viewer with regret, the resurrection of Inger seems too pat an ending, and not too challenging in terms of religion, nor science. To answer, though, that this is because this film is about faith and its necessity doubt, as framed by Kierkegaard, therefore one must suspend disbelief to `get it', is to let Dreyer's own filmic and writing failures off the hook because those things he was in control of also fail, despite or because of that belief system. I'm sure that there are many critics who have been, and are, more than willing to grant the director such favor, as I read enough of them in my researching the critical reception this film got, but you'll have to look elsewhere for such poor critique. If the Internet bores you, try the books of Leonard Maltin or Roger Ebert. I'll be rewatching Vampyr in the meantime.

1136252,AC4Z26E60FBEM,B001298BPY,Fr. Charles Erlandson,"[2, 2]","""Ordet"" is one of those incredible foreign films that are such a startling contrast to the films of Hollywood that they make you think of all the possibilities inherent in the medium of film that most moviegoers miss out on.  It is, in fact, one of the greatest religious movies ever made.  ""Ordet"" means ""The Word,"" and ""Ordet"" can be viewed an exposition of what ""The Word"" (Jesus Christ) is supposed to mean to individuals and their lives.""Ordet"" centers primarily on the Borgen family, especially the elderly father (Morten), who has to contend with questions concerning the true nature of Christianity.  One of his sons (John, or Johannes) has gone crazy through too much theological study and speaks with the words and authority of Jesus Christ throughout the film.  What are the family members to make of one who is crazy, but crazy like a living prophet in their midst?  Another son, Anders, desires to marry someone from a group in the community with a different view of Christianity (as well as part of a family with whom Morten is feuding).  A third son, Mikkel, is without faith, although he's married to a woman full of faith and who is in many ways, along with John, the spiritual center of the film (Inger).Morten wrestles not only with disappointments in his sons but also with his own lack of faith to some degree.  He has genuine faith throughout, but often doubts and often has little zeal for God.  In fact, the theme of lukewarm Christianity versus a stronger, more faithful Christianity is a major theme throughout ""Ordet.""Throughout the movie, spiritual questions and truth are conveyed in a way that Hollywood has seemed incapable of producing, even in an earlier era.  The black and white is not only beautiful but also entirely appropriate for the condition of the church and culture in Denmark.  While the slow pace and lack of dramatic cues (such as insistent music or quick cuts) will seem boring to most American moviegoers, ""Ordet"" allows for a more leisurely and thoughtful examination of the meaning of life than almost any American movie.  Throughout, ""Ordet"" is a powerful film that challenges but also edifies the viewer.Dreyer's masterful control of the film extends to his wonderful choice of casting.  This is especially true for Birgitte Federspiel, who played Inger, the daughter-in-law, who helps  hold things in the family together and who is at the center of the events of the movie.  When Dreyer hired her, she was already pregnant in real life, which adds authenticity to the film.  What's more, Dreyer sent a sound technician out to record the actual sounds of Federspiel's own labor and delivery to use in the film!Favorite line: When there is a discussion of how John (Johannes) went mad, the parson is told by Mikkel:""No. Something happened.""""Was it... a love affair?"" the parson asks.The answer is priceless: ""No, no. It was Sren Kierkegaard.""This is especially humorous to me, since my father loves Kierkegaard and has written a book on him!  Actually, after viewing Ordet and witnessing how dismal the Christianity there could be, one begins to understand what Kierkegaard was trying to say.Both ""Ordet"" and Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" rank as two of the greatest religious movies ever made.",5,One of the Best Religious Movies of All Time,1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,3254,"['Ordet', 'one', 'incredible', 'foreign', 'films', 'are', 'startling', 'contrast', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'think', 'possibilities', 'inherent', 'medium', 'film', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'miss', 'out', 'fact', 'one', 'greatest', 'religious', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Ordet', 'Word', 'Ordet', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'exposition', 'what', 'Word', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'supposed', 'mean', 'individuals', 'lives', 'Ordet', 'centers', 'primarily', 'Borgen', 'family', 'especially', 'elderly', 'father', 'Morten', 'who', 'contend', 'questions', 'concerning', 'true', 'nature', 'Christianity', 'One', 'sons', 'John', 'Johannes', 'gone', 'crazy', 'too', 'much', 'theological', 'study', 'speaks', 'words', 'authority', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'film', 'What', 'are', 'family', 'members', 'make', 'one', 'who', 'crazy', 'crazy', 'living', 'prophet', 'midst', 'son', 'Anders', 'marry', 'someone', 'group', 'community', 'different', 'view', 'Christianity', 'as', 'well', 'part', 'family', 'whom', 'Morten', 'feuding', 'third', 'son', 'Mikkel', 'faith', 'married', 'woman', 'full', 'faith', 'who', 'many', 'ways', 'John', 'spiritual', 'center', 'film', 'Inger', '.Morten', 'not', 'only', 'disappointments', 'sons', 'also', 'own', 'lack', 'faith', 'degree', 'genuine', 'faith', 'often', 'doubts', 'often', 'little', 'zeal', 'God', 'fact', 'theme', 'lukewarm', 'Christianity', 'versus', 'stronger', 'more', 'faithful', 'Christianity', 'major', 'theme', 'Ordet', 'movie', 'spiritual', 'questions', 'truth', 'are', 'conveyed', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'seemed', 'incapable', 'producing', 'even', 'earlier', 'era', 'black', 'white', 'not', 'only', 'beautiful', 'also', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'condition', 'church', 'culture', 'Denmark', 'slow', 'pace', 'lack', 'dramatic', 'cues', 'such', 'insistent', 'music', 'quick', 'cuts', 'will', 'seem', 'boring', 'most', 'American', 'moviegoers', 'Ordet', 'more', 'leisurely', 'thoughtful', 'examination', 'meaning', 'life', 'almost', 'American', 'movie', 'Throughout', 'Ordet', 'powerful', 'film', 'also', 'viewer.Dreyer', 'masterful', 'control', 'film', 'wonderful', 'choice', 'casting', 'especially', 'true', 'Birgitte', 'Federspiel', 'who', 'played', 'Inger', 'daughter-in-law', 'who', 'hold', 'things', 'family', 'together', 'who', 'center', 'events', 'movie', 'When', 'Dreyer', 'hired', 'was', 'already', 'pregnant', 'real', 'life', 'authenticity', 'film', 'What', 'more', 'Dreyer', 'sent', 'sound', 'technician', 'record', 'actual', 'sounds', 'Federspiel', 'own', 'labor', 'delivery', 'use', 'film', 'Favorite', 'line', 'When', 'discussion', 'how', 'John', 'Johannes', 'went', 'mad', 'parson', 'told', 'Mikkel', 'Something', 'happened', 'Was', 'love', 'affair', 'parson', 'asks.The', 'answer', 'priceless', 'No', 'was', 'Sren', 'Kierkegaard', 'especially', 'humorous', 'father', 'Kierkegaard', 'written', 'book', 'Actually', 'viewing', 'Ordet', 'witnessing', 'how', 'dismal', 'Christianity', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'understand', 'what', 'Kierkegaard', 'was', 'trying', 'say.Both', 'Ordet', 'Dreyer', 'Passion', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'rank', 'two', 'greatest', 'religious', 'movies', 'ever', 'made']",ORDET Carl Theodor Dreyer 1955

It is a story of a religious family tied up in the religious niceties which separate them from some of their neighbors.  The story is told in black-and-white and is quite deliberately relentless and slow-paced building to some kind of conclusion.The son goes off to Divinity school to learn his trade as a preacher...but...returns only a few months later, quite mad.  It is a tragedy almost greater than death.  The son, who has evidently driven himself mad by his own religious intensity, comes to believe, like many schizophrenics before and after him, that he is the resurrected Christ.  His memory of Christ's sermons is excellent and he sermonizes sonorously to everyone and no one.  Daily, he goes down to sea and delivers the Sermon on the Mount to the advancing waves.  Despite and perhaps because of his family's faith, their son is ignored.The film, in its own way, asks the question about how modern people might view the returned Messiah should he actually show up.  The mad son, returning to his home in which the family are grieving the death of a young woman, goes in to see the dead body...well, the rest you'll have to see yourself.Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico",5,Messianic Madness,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,1412,"['Ordet', 'excellent', 'film', 'have', 'awarded', '5', 'stars', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'equal', 'Dreyer', 'great', 'Day', 'Wrath', 'story', 'religious', 'family', 'tied', 'up', 'religious', 'niceties', 'separate', 'neighbors', 'story', 'told', 'black-and-white', 'quite', 'deliberately', 'relentless', 'slow-paced', 'building', 'kind', 'conclusion.The', 'son', 'Divinity', 'school', 'learn', 'trade', 'preacher', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'quite', 'mad', 'tragedy', 'almost', 'greater', 'death', 'son', 'who', 'evidently', 'driven', 'mad', 'own', 'religious', 'intensity', 'believe', 'many', 'schizophrenics', 'resurrected', 'Christ', 'memory', 'Christ', 'sermons', 'excellent', 'sonorously', 'everyone', 'one', 'Daily', 'down', 'sea', 'delivers', 'Sermon', 'Mount', 'advancing', 'waves', 'perhaps', 'family', 'faith', 'son', 'ignored.The', 'film', 'own', 'way', 'question', 'how', 'modern', 'people', 'might', 'view', 'returned', 'Messiah', 'should', 'actually', 'show', 'up', 'mad', 'son', 'returning', 'home', 'family', 'are', 'grieving', 'death', 'young', 'woman', 'see', 'dead', 'body', 'well', 'rest', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'yourself.Ron', 'Braithwaite', 'author', 'novels', 'Skull', 'Rack', 'Hummingbird', 'God', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'Mexico']",ORDET Carl Theodor Dreyer 1955
