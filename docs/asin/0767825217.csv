His wife, played by MacDowell,exudes a confident, tolerant, positive attitude contrasting with hisown, yet both actors seem perfectly comfortable and natural in theirroles.The soundtrack is done to perfection, with a number immediatelyrecognizeable by Bobby Dylan, with other folk and blues numbers mostclosely associated with the Mississipi Delta.The self-proclaimed atheism of Keitel, from the lessons of life, inthe picture, is  compared to his wife's beliefs, that are strong.The natural inclination of kids to get along, leaving aside mentalstrategic, monetary, social, calculated or cultural objectives,despite their families station in life, is shown.The fact that a dying elderly Black man, is adopted by Keitel, whopays his funeral and burial expenses despite utter poverty, tells alot about the farmer's character and ability to think things throughby himself, not showing a knee-jerk reaction to norms, mores, taboosof society at large imposed on him and all others.For that reason, despite atheistic, Keitel from his behavior andmorality shown, is a deeply religious man, discarding birth control,social class or racial pigeonholing  - ""loving thy neighbor"" as oftentold.Due to the autobiographical nature of the film, it tells of nostalgiaamong the elderly, when wild rivers were clean enough to drink fromand bathe in, birds were in the backyard, the Model - T was a newautomobile, when the notion of  cemetaries being compulsory forburials was only a new innovation and law passed, when bartering wasstill possible in the marketplace. Despite the funeral operator'sbusiness - minded, hard dollars approach,  he sees that handling thedeceased as an undertaked is more than just running a meat shop.This is as clean-cut as it comes, for Keitel as an actor, consideringhis ""tough guy"" image from a number of other works, such as Fingers,or Scorcese's pictures, etc.",3,"Intriguing as a story, and surprisingly entertaining as a movie",1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,3387,"['SHADRACH', '1998', 'starring', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'narratedby', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'unrecognizable', 'voice', 'especially', 'intriguing', 'asa', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'movie.Although', 'clearly', 'sanitized', 'idyllic', 'obviously', 'intended', 'afamily', 'movie', 'specifically', 'watchable', 'kids', 'ages', 'genders', 'story', 'convincingly', 'telling', 'important', 'lessons', 'pastand', 'present', 'various', 'economic', 'social', 'politican', 'contexts.Perhaps', 'will', 'clue-in', 'kids', 'conversations', 'topics', 'needto', 'pick', 'up', 'grow', 'up.Based', 'Virginia', 'showing', 'slavery', 'legacy', 'story', 'unfoldingduring', 'Prohibition', 'eta', '1920', '30', 'forefronthow', 'even', 'humblest', 'most', 'poor', 'segments', 'population', 'are', 'ableto', 'show', 'immense', 'decency', 'moral', 'fiber', 'belief', 'Humanity', 'thattoo', 'often', 'discounted', 'other', 'segments', 'population.Wealth', 'accumulation', 'social', 'status', 'material', 'goods', 'too', 'often', 'isconfused', 'what', 'moral', 'be-all', 'end-all', 'Life.Admittedly', 'Keitel', 'Southern', 'Virginia', 'accent', 'not', 'mostrealistic', 'articulation', 'life', 'most', 'natural', 'heplays', 'farmer', 'moonshiner', 'large', 'farm', 'outskirts', 'asmall', 'town', 'sustaining', 'family', 'Great', 'Depression.Indeed', 'Keitel', 'quintessential', 'city-minded', 'demeanor', 'showing', 'anervous', 'high-strung', 'stressed', 'out', 'mental', 'process', 'somewhat', 'throwinghis', 'family', 'balance', 'pressures', 'even', 'theanimals', 'birds', 'chirping', 'outside', 'wife', 'played', 'MacDowell', 'confident', 'tolerant', 'positive', 'attitude', 'contrasting', 'hisown', 'yet', 'actors', 'seem', 'perfectly', 'comfortable', 'natural', 'theirroles.The', 'soundtrack', 'done', 'perfection', 'number', 'immediatelyrecognizeable', 'Bobby', 'Dylan', 'other', 'folk', 'blues', 'numbers', 'mostclosely', 'associated', 'Mississipi', 'Delta.The', 'self-proclaimed', 'atheism', 'Keitel', 'lessons', 'life', 'inthe', 'picture', 'compared', 'wife', 'beliefs', 'are', 'strong.The', 'natural', 'inclination', 'kids', 'get', 'along', 'leaving', 'aside', 'mentalstrategic', 'monetary', 'social', 'calculated', 'cultural', 'objectives', 'families', 'station', 'life', 'shown.The', 'fact', 'dying', 'elderly', 'Black', 'man', 'adopted', 'Keitel', 'funeral', 'burial', 'expenses', 'utter', 'poverty', 'alot', 'farmer', 'character', 'ability', 'think', 'things', 'not', 'showing', 'knee-jerk', 'reaction', 'norms', 'mores', 'taboosof', 'society', 'large', 'imposed', 'others.For', 'reason', 'atheistic', 'Keitel', 'behavior', 'andmorality', 'shown', 'deeply', 'religious', 'man', 'discarding', 'birth', 'control', 'social', 'class', 'racial', 'pigeonholing', 'loving', 'thy', 'neighbor', 'oftentold.Due', 'autobiographical', 'nature', 'film', 'elderly', 'when', 'wild', 'rivers', 'were', 'clean', 'enough', 'drink', 'fromand', 'bathe', 'birds', 'were', 'backyard', 'Model', 'T', 'was', 'newautomobile', 'when', 'notion', 'cemetaries', 'being', 'compulsory', 'forburials', 'was', 'only', 'new', 'innovation', 'law', 'passed', 'when', 'bartering', 'wasstill', 'possible', 'marketplace', 'funeral', ""operator'sbusiness"", 'minded', 'hard', 'dollars', 'approach', 'handling', 'thedeceased', 'undertaked', 'more', 'just', 'running', 'meat', 'shop.This', 'as', 'clean-cut', 'Keitel', 'actor', 'consideringhis', 'tough', 'guy', 'image', 'number', 'other', 'works', 'such', 'Fingers', 'Scorcese', 'pictures', 'etc']",N/A

Fiske,"[1, 1]","this movie supposedly so controversal that it was practically banned,and unable to rent or even buy,until now.  it tells the south as it is,and as it was!!!As unpleasant as it might be to look at how the blacks were treated,this is our american history!!!!Roots depicted exactly how things were in the lives of slaves and was one of the most watched ever. We cried,we hid our faces,we struck our breasts in humility and shame that we  allowed the treatment of blacks,and even shared in this.Generations have passed,and there still is not equality.A lot of the southern ways refuse to accept that change was long long overdue,and still cling to the old biases and prejudice(despite there are laws now,and a black President) Getting back to this movie--------it speaks of prejudices'it speaks of derogotary terms for blacks a lot;it speaks of mores and attitudes of the time ;it speaks of the poor whites during the depression  trying to survive and raise their families. The greatest parts of this movie was the COMPASSION AND DIGNITY IN DYING THAT WAS SHOWN TO SHADRACK!!tHIS FAMILY TREATED THIS OLD BLACK MAN WITH RESPECT,LOVE,KINDNESS,AND TOTALLY IGNORED THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN--THEY TREATED HIM AS A FELLOW HUMAN BEING!!!!!!I can't say enough for the message that this movie sent out---it educated me and us--that's the way life and relationships should be.

There is a little boy who is the only child of a well to do family in Virginia in 1935 during the Depression. while his parents decide to go to Baltimore to a family funeral, they decide to leave the son Paul with the Dabney's. A seemingly ne'er do well family for a week, reluctantly while they go to a funeral. It is there that Paul and his Dabney friend encounter Shadrack, a 99 year old man who hitched rides and walked from Alabama, where he lived for the past 70 plus years to Virginia, where he was born and die there. It seems the Dabney's were slaveholders, but at that point, they were barely scratching just trying to survive.The head of the house, played by Harvey Keitel, is a bootlegger, trying to make a few dollars and keep his family going. His wife, played by Andie McDowell, is a beer drinking, yet warm hearted woman, who takes Shadrack in and take him to the old homestead as he wished. Well, the sheriff, thanks to his bootleg partner, whose don't trust Paul to keep their secret but would sure tell the sheriff everything, is breathing down Keitel's throat to have a respectable colored funeral home put old Shadrack to rest. This don't sit well with Keitel, but to keep the peace, he goes and meets with the funeral director and though he don't like it, he goes with it.
