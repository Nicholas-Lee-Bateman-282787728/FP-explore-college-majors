What is it about men from Israel?  It seems like everytime one of them crosses my path, he isnt just handsome he is like the personification of beautiful man.  I wish I could go to Israel and pick one up and bring him home.  The men in this movie are so pretty it hurts. Especially that one guy, I think his name was Boaz. OMG, beautiful.  Danny was hot too.

1336106,A376ZUGQYR6CJB,B003BV8HVE,D. Homsher,"[6, 6]","I'm not going to revisit the plot basics, which can be seen elsewhere.  I found the movie enjoyable but somewhat frustrating because just as I started to get into a character or relationship, the film switched gears and took up another plot line with different characters. Yes, everyone is tied together along the way (or at the end), but a tighter focus on fewer relationships would have allowed for more development and depth. Too much screen time was squandered. Was a UFO subplot necessary? Also, the over the top mother seemed too campy for the basic, overall tone of the film.  I felt the film attempted too much and came up a little short.",4,3 and 1/2 stars,1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,646,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'revisit', 'plot', 'basics', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'found', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'somewhat', 'frustrating', 'because', 'just', 'started', 'get', 'character', 'relationship', 'film', 'switched', 'gears', 'took', 'up', 'plot', 'line', 'different', 'characters', 'Yes', 'everyone', 'tied', 'together', 'way', 'end', 'tighter', 'focus', 'fewer', 'relationships', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'more', 'development', 'depth', 'Too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'squandered', 'Was', 'UFO', 'subplot', 'necessary', 'Also', 'top', 'mother', 'seemed', 'too', 'campy', 'basic', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'felt', 'film', 'attempted', 'too', 'much', 'came', 'up', 'little', 'short']",N/A

1336108,A2I6NXIPHKCESI,B003BV8HVE,"J. Zomer ""jzg""","[8, 11]","I'm not gonna say this is an awful movie since at least I was able to watch it till the end. When I read the other reviews it feels as if they saw a different movie altogether.First of all, the sipnopsis says this is all about Omer, however, this character doesn't show up until about half the movie. The first 40 min are a series of short scenes were more and more characters are presented to the viewer without making clear what the conflict is or where they are going. There are so many characters in the picture that add absolutely nothing to it that is just hard to keep track.Added to that, you get some rather weird choices from the directors, like casting a man to play the mother. This choice does nothing for either the character or the story other that making the viewer ask over and over again what the deal is.The story about Omer's sister is also different from what the reviewers mention. She is gay and was about to marry her boss when she canceled the wedding. They get back together without really fixing what separated them in the first place.Finally Omer is nothing but a second show story. Having the movie revolve about Dani instead.However, there is not one story in the whole movie that is fully treated, discussed and resolved. It feels more like a quilt of stories than a well made film.",2,Not awful but not great either,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,1313,"[""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'say', 'awful', 'movie', 'least', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'till', 'end', 'When', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'saw', 'different', 'movie', 'altogether.First', 'sipnopsis', 'Omer', 'however', 'character', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'movie', 'first', '40', 'min', 'are', 'series', 'short', 'scenes', 'were', 'more', 'more', 'characters', 'are', 'presented', 'viewer', 'making', 'clear', 'what', 'conflict', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'picture', 'add', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'just', 'hard', 'keep', 'track.Added', 'get', 'rather', 'weird', 'choices', 'directors', 'casting', 'man', 'play', 'mother', 'choice', 'nothing', 'character', 'story', 'other', 'making', 'viewer', 'ask', 'over', 'again', 'what', 'deal', 'is.The', 'story', 'Omer', 'sister', 'also', 'different', 'what', 'reviewers', 'mention', 'gay', 'was', 'marry', 'boss', 'when', 'canceled', 'wedding', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'really', 'fixing', 'what', 'separated', 'first', 'place.Finally', 'Omer', 'nothing', 'second', 'show', 'story', 'Having', 'movie', 'revolve', 'Dani', 'instead.However', 'not', 'one', 'story', 'whole', 'movie', 'fully', 'treated', 'discussed', 'resolved', 'more', 'quilt', 'stories', 'well', 'made', 'film']",N/A

1336110,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B003BV8HVE,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","This is an Israeli gay film from director Yair Hochner (he also made `Good Boys' in 2005). It centres around Omer who is approaching his thirtieth birthday and has done little with his personal life choosing to lose himself in the books at the library where he works. His sister is in an unconventional relationship with her boss who owns a coffee house. They have a mother who is one seriously over made up drag queen - which is never explained and is all the better for it.He meets a twenty year old Danny on a blindish date and he sort of gets his Mojo back. He also has a keen interest in alien abduction; well it takes all sorts. Then enter handsome, gay journalist Ronen who is interviewing a renowned author who actually believes that she has been abducted. They go along to a therapy group and the chemistry starts to flow.This does have a number of characters and plots but they all come together (forgive the pun) as insight give way to hormones and the birthday party that Omers `mum' is throwing brings things to the fore. Theer is a fair bit of bedroom activity in this and it is all done with taste and care. There3 is also some comedic moments and some fine performances.It is in Hebrew, with some English and German and very good sub titles. This is one of the better gay films and Israel keeps on coming up with surprises like this (`Eyes Wide Open', `The Bubble' and `Yosssi and Jagger') and on the evidence of this I think we can expect more. I for one will be only too keen for another offering from Mr Hochner or any of his compatriots.",4,Israeli Cinema Comes of Age,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,1557,"['Israeli', 'gay', 'film', 'director', 'Yair', 'Hochner', 'also', 'made', 'Good', 'Boys', '2005', 'Omer', 'who', 'approaching', 'thirtieth', 'birthday', 'done', 'little', 'personal', 'life', 'choosing', 'lose', 'books', 'library', 'where', 'sister', 'unconventional', 'relationship', 'boss', 'who', 'coffee', 'house', 'have', 'mother', 'who', 'one', 'seriously', 'made', 'up', 'drag', 'never', 'explained', 'better', 'it.He', 'meets', 'twenty', 'year', 'old', 'Danny', 'blindish', 'date', 'sort', 'Mojo', 'back', 'also', 'keen', 'interest', 'alien', 'abduction', 'sorts', 'Then', 'enter', 'handsome', 'gay', 'journalist', 'Ronen', 'who', 'interviewing', 'renowned', 'author', 'who', 'actually', 'been', 'abducted', 'go', 'along', 'therapy', 'group', 'chemistry', 'flow.This', 'have', 'number', 'characters', 'plots', 'come', 'together', 'forgive', 'pun', 'insight', 'give', 'way', 'hormones', 'birthday', 'party', 'Omers', 'mum', 'throwing', 'brings', 'things', 'fore', 'Theer', 'fair', 'bit', 'bedroom', 'activity', 'done', 'taste', 'care', 'There3', 'also', 'comedic', 'moments', 'fine', 'performances.It', 'Hebrew', 'English', 'German', 'very', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', 'one', 'better', 'gay', 'films', 'Israel', 'keeps', 'coming', 'up', 'surprises', 'Eyes', 'Open', 'Bubble', 'Yosssi', 'Jagger', 'evidence', 'think', 'can', 'expect', 'more', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'only', 'too', 'keen', 'offering', 'Mr', 'Hochner', 'compatriots']",N/A
