I bought it one along with the Level 2 and went straight into the Level 2 after that.I do have a somewhat athletic background, and/but am naturally very inflexible and not the best at balance. Coming from that background, although I enjoyed this DVD I personally found it too easy.",3,"Too easy even for some beginners, IMO.",1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,415,"['DVD', 'first', 'real', 'Yoga', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'was', 'relaxing', 'found', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'only', 'used', 'DVD', 'once', 'bought', 'one', 'Level', '2', 'went', 'straight', 'Level', '2', 'that.I', 'do', 'have', 'somewhat', 'athletic', 'background', 'and/but', 'am', 'naturally', 'very', 'inflexible', 'not', 'best', 'balance', 'Coming', 'background', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'personally', 'found', 'too', 'easy']",N/A

Out of all of them, Baron is definitely my overall favorite teacher, hands down!This program is a 30 minute, moderate intensity vinyasa flow. It  is similar in intensity with Baron's ""Unlocking Athletic Power"" and ""Core Power"" programs in terms of length and difficulty. It's slightly more intense (mostly just by virtue of being 10 minutes longer) than his ""Power Yoga Basics"" program which is found on his ""Transform Your Life, Yoga With Baron Baptiste"" which was originally aired on PBS.This ""Journey Into Power"" Level 1 program is very well rounded, has clear instruction and a nice overall feel to it. It's a class setting so you get to see lots of different ways of doing the poses.Baron has a wonderful approach in that students should use their intuition to approach the poses at their own level of ability or energy level on any given day. You should go to your own personal ""edge"" without going into overwhelm.I've been doing Yoga daily for over 7 years and found this DVD very useful for a shorter practice. My 12 year old football playing son has worked with Baron's programs and has gotten tremendous benefits from them (and did this particular DVD this morning) and my wife who is fairly new to yoga jumped right in to this program and has really enjoyed it and is making wonderful progress in strength and flexibility after only doing it for about 4 or 5 days. She also loves Baron's approach which is not intimidating even though she still finds it challenging enough to make her feel like she's getting benefits from it.I hope this review helps those who are interested in trying a vinyasa (flow) based style of yoga, those curious about Baron as a teacher in particular  or those who may be familiar with Baptise Power Vinyasa Yoga but are looking for a shorter practice to mix in with their other programs.Namaste",5,"Baron, Great As Always!",1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,1906,"['have', 'very', 'extensive', 'Yoga', 'DVD/Video', 'collection', '80', 'counting', 'Baron', 'definitely', 'overall', 'favorite', 'teacher', 'down', 'program', '30', 'minute', 'moderate', 'intensity', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'similar', 'intensity', 'Baron', 'Unlocking', 'Athletic', 'Power', 'Core', 'Power', 'programs', 'terms', 'length', 'difficulty', 'slightly', 'more', 'intense', 'mostly', 'just', 'virtue', 'being', '10', 'minutes', 'longer', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Basics', 'program', 'found', 'Transform', 'Your', 'Life', 'Yoga', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'PBS.This', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Power', 'Level', '1', 'program', 'very', 'well', 'rounded', 'clear', 'instruction', 'nice', 'overall', 'feel', 'class', 'setting', 'so', 'get', 'see', 'lots', 'different', 'ways', 'doing', 'poses.Baron', 'wonderful', 'approach', 'students', 'should', 'use', 'intuition', 'approach', 'poses', 'own', 'level', 'ability', 'energy', 'level', 'given', 'day', 'should', 'go', 'own', 'personal', 'edge', 'going', 'overwhelm.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Yoga', 'daily', '7', 'years', 'found', 'DVD', 'very', 'useful', 'shorter', 'practice', '12', 'year', 'old', 'football', 'playing', 'son', 'worked', 'Baron', 'programs', 'gotten', 'tremendous', 'benefits', 'did', 'particular', 'DVD', 'morning', 'wife', 'who', 'fairly', 'new', 'yoga', 'jumped', 'right', 'program', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'making', 'wonderful', 'progress', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'only', 'doing', 'about', '4', '5', 'days', 'also', 'Baron', 'approach', 'not', 'intimidating', 'even', 'still', 'challenging', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', 'getting', 'benefits', 'it.I', 'hope', 'review', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'trying', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'based', 'style', 'yoga', 'curious', 'about', 'Baron', 'teacher', 'particular', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', 'Baptise', 'Power', 'Vinyasa', 'Yoga', 'are', 'looking', 'shorter', 'practice', 'mix', 'other', 'programs.Namaste']",N/A

I started taking a Vinyasa class and was unable to coordinate my schedule with class times so I looked for a video to supplement my practice at home.  What a great choice.  Baron Baptiste takes his time to explain the poses and provides the mood that is needed to practice yoga at home.

I think yoga is the ultimate workout.  It got my heart rate up enough to qualify for aerobic, but it also builds strength, flexibility, balance, concentration, good breathing habits, and on and on.  I checked out one of Baron's books at the library and really enjoyed, so decided to buy one of his videos.  I was disappointed in the video.  It's not a bad video, but I don't care for the format.  I prefer an individual instructing alone and demonstrating poses, but Baron filmed this in one of his classes.  Throughout the video he walks around the room critiquing and correcting postures.  He is very positive and upbeat, but not very instructional.  I want a video where I don't have to constantly be looking at the video to do the exercise.  I want verbal instruction in addition to the visual.  This is not a bad video, but if you want to know more about Baron and his brand of yoga, I suggest buying one of his books.",3,"Good yoga, format not for me",1255564800,"10 15, 2009",2009,1039,"['attended', 'two', 'classes', 'power-yoga', 'spring', 'never', 'having', 'had', 'experience', 'yoga', 'loved', 'think', 'ultimate', 'workout', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'enough', 'qualify', 'aerobic', 'also', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'balance', 'concentration', 'good', 'breathing', 'habits', 'checked', 'out', 'one', 'Baron', 'books', 'library', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'decided', 'buy', 'one', 'videos', 'was', 'disappointed', 'video', 'not', 'bad', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'format', 'prefer', 'individual', 'instructing', 'alone', 'demonstrating', 'poses', 'Baron', 'filmed', 'one', 'classes', 'video', 'room', 'critiquing', 'correcting', 'postures', 'very', 'positive', 'upbeat', 'not', 'very', 'instructional', 'want', 'video', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'constantly', 'be', 'looking', 'video', 'do', 'exercise', 'want', 'verbal', 'instruction', 'addition', 'visual', 'not', 'bad', 'video', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'Baron', 'brand', 'yoga', 'suggest', 'buying', 'one', 'books']",N/A

I also have to work within some physical limitations.That said, I found this video far too slow and disjointed and, as one reviewer said, too easy even for beginners. It had no flow like you expect in vinyasa yoga.I would say that if you need to learn the very basic poses this would be a good video. But if you want a short practice that flows, this is not a good video for you.I would suggest a Bryan Kest video or most any other Baron Baptiste videos. But just not this one.I enjoy short practices and Rodney Yee, Bryan Kest and even Baron have some very good ones.
