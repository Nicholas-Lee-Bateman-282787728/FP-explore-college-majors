Unfortunately, they are witnessed by Kevin, the hospital morgue attendant, who videos their antics on his cellphone. Rather than have their future careers ruined, said students decide to get the guy wasted instead, so they can destroy the evidence. Of course, things go horribly awry, leaving poor Kev in a deep coma! After dumping him in the hospital parking lot, our heroes go back to their studies. Oh no! One of the students w/ a conscience tries to help Kevin by injecting him w/ an experimental drug. Now, Kevin has psychic abilities, enabling him to possess those around him, turning them into his personal assassins of vengeance! RED MIST is a well-made, dark thriller w/ just enough horror elements to keep it creepy.

1192398,A26PEFWHKUHN7O,B001FU7930,Captain Insanity,"[8, 11]","**WARNING**This movie is not for epileptics.You WILL have a seizure like The Simpsons did when they went to Japan.What we have here is a very ""Shocker""-esque flick about ""out of body experiences"" from the guy who directed the cult hit ""Shrooms"".A group of med students accidentally take a joke a little too far,which lands the mentally-challenged, all too creepy, epileptic janitor at their college in a deep coma.One of the students, feeling guilt for dumping him at the hospital,injects him with an untested drug that revitalizes brain function, but causes out of body experiences.But not just any OOBE,this drug gives him the ability to possess others.And of course he uses it to seek out revenge.Hence the name Red Mist. (A feeling of rage that temporarily clouds one's judgement.)There were plenty of deaths in this flick,all of which, should have-could have been a lot gorier.Don't get me wrong there was SOME blood.but not nearly enough to match the viciousness of the deaths themselves.The one death that should have delivered the most gore, (acid funnel) delivered the least, which seemed kind of like a cheap cop-out.Aside from absent gore the movie also never seemed to mount any suspense.Ok ok maybe the one scene, where the mother was standing at the head of the stairs holding the baby, was suspenseful(subsequently this also happens to be the only scene in the whole film that pours on the red stuff)but the rest of the movie was straight forward to the point of being predictable.Anytime anyone was possessed their nose would bleed so there was no surprise.If that small effect (nose bleed) were omitted the plot might have actually had the chance to pile on some tension.Essentially; had the gore & suspense been present.. this flick would have been dynamite,the acting was great,the plot was interesting enough,it had some nice production values,like the camera work of a big budget flick.It had all the makings of a great horror movie,but just fell flat in the one department that should have made it.If you're going to title your film ""Red Mist"" at least have the decency to show me some splatter.3 stars = Worth a rental, but not a purchaseMORAL OF THE STORY:If you're going to accidentally kill someone don't do a halfast job.ALSO RECOMMENDED:Shrooms, Shocker, Fallen, Jason Goes to Hell, Dead in 3 Days, Flatliners, Sublime,  Scanners, The Dead Zone, Infection, Unrest, The Signal",3,Revenge of the Vegetable,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,2403,"['**WARNING**This', 'movie', 'not', 'epileptics.You', 'WILL', 'have', 'seizure', 'Simpsons', 'did', 'when', 'went', 'Japan.What', 'have', 'here', 'very', 'Shocker', '-esque', 'flick', 'body', 'experiences', 'guy', 'who', 'directed', 'cult', 'hit', 'Shrooms', '.A', 'group', 'med', 'students', 'accidentally', 'take', 'joke', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'mentally-challenged', 'too', 'creepy', 'epileptic', 'janitor', 'college', 'deep', 'coma.One', 'students', 'feeling', 'guilt', 'dumping', 'hospital', 'untested', 'drug', 'brain', 'function', 'body', 'not', 'just', 'OOBE', 'drug', 'ability', 'possess', 'others.And', 'course', 'seek', 'out', 'revenge.Hence', 'name', 'Red', 'Mist', 'feeling', 'rage', 'temporarily', 'one', 'judgement', 'were', 'plenty', 'deaths', 'flick', 'should', 'have-could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'gorier.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', 'SOME', 'blood.but', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'match', 'viciousness', 'deaths', 'one', 'death', 'should', 'have', 'delivered', 'most', 'gore', 'acid', 'funnel', 'delivered', 'least', 'seemed', 'kind', 'cheap', 'cop-out.Aside', 'absent', 'movie', 'also', 'never', 'seemed', 'mount', 'suspense.Ok', 'ok', 'maybe', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'mother', 'was', 'standing', 'head', 'stairs', 'holding', 'baby', 'was', 'suspenseful', 'subsequently', 'also', 'be', 'only', 'scene', 'whole', 'film', 'red', 'stuff', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'straight', 'forward', 'point', 'being', 'predictable.Anytime', 'anyone', 'was', 'possessed', 'nose', 'would', 'bleed', 'so', 'was', 'surprise.If', 'small', 'effect', 'nose', 'bleed', 'were', 'omitted', 'plot', 'might', 'have', 'actually', 'had', 'chance', 'pile', 'tension.Essentially', 'had', 'gore', 'suspense', 'been', 'present..', 'flick', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'dynamite', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'plot', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'had', 'nice', 'production', 'values', 'camera', 'work', 'big', 'budget', 'flick.It', 'had', 'makings', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'just', 'fell', 'flat', 'one', 'department', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'it.If', ""'re"", 'going', 'title', 'film', 'Red', 'Mist', 'least', 'have', 'decency', 'show', 'splatter.3', 'stars', '=', 'rental', 'not', 'purchaseMORAL', 'THE', 'STORY', ""'re"", 'going', 'accidentally', 'kill', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'halfast', 'job.ALSO', 'RECOMMENDED', 'Shrooms', 'Shocker', 'Fallen', 'Jason', 'Goes', 'Hell', 'Dead', '3', 'Days', 'Flatliners', 'Sublime', 'Scanners', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'Infection', 'Unrest', 'Signal']",Red Mist

Slow beginning and then started picking up speed and kept me entertained till the end. I think this had a lot of potential to be better. It was an interesting idea, done in an interesting way which set it apart from typical slasher horror movies, and typical villians.It succeeded in the characters your supposed to like you do and the ones your supposed to hate, you really do hate. I was expecting it to suck and it didn't but wasn't quite good enough to get me to buy it. IF it had been unrated rather than an R and they had pushed that, gone that one step further into ""unrated territory"" upping the violence, gore, blood and other things you expect to find in an unrated horror movie could've or would've been enough to probably purchase the Dvd. it's certainly ""Creepy"", but misses in the making you jump or gasp areas.It's still entertaining but just barely misses in the I want to buy this movie category.Since they leave the ending open, perhaps we'll see the much needed ""unrated"" push in a sequel.

1192402,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B001FU7930,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 5]","Red Mist, also known as Freakdog (which is a more suitable and sensible title), is an interesting little indie horror flick.  Arielle Kebbel (The Uninvited, John Tucker Must Die) stars as Catherine; a young doctor hopeful who, along with her group of fellow med students (including Sarah Carter) accidentally cause the creepy Kenneth (Andrew Lee Potts) to go into a coma.  Catherine feels bad naturally, so she administers an experimental drug to Kenneth with the hopes that he'll survive, only to find that it makes him have outer body experiences in which he can posess anyone and wreck brutal vengeance on his wrong-doers.  Surprisingly well-filmed and well-acted, Red Mist is a violent and compelling little thriller that you will be surprised with.  What hurts the film however is that it isn't suspenseful or scary in the least, but then again, it doesn't fall to any sort of typical slasher conventions either, which it easily could have.  It occasionally plods along as well, but for the most part, Red Mist is a worthwhile shocker that is definitely worth giving a chance.  Plus, it has the gorgeous Arielle Kebbel running around in her underwear, and that alone makes anything worth seeing.",3,"A flawed, but interesting, shocker",1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,1200,"['Red', 'Mist', 'also', 'known', 'Freakdog', 'more', 'suitable', 'sensible', 'title', 'interesting', 'little', 'indie', 'horror', 'flick', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'Uninvited', 'John', 'Tucker', 'Must', 'Die', 'Catherine', 'young', 'doctor', 'hopeful', 'who', 'group', 'fellow', 'med', 'students', 'including', 'Sarah', 'Carter', 'accidentally', 'cause', 'creepy', 'Kenneth', 'Andrew', 'Lee', 'Potts', 'go', 'coma', 'Catherine', 'bad', 'naturally', 'experimental', 'drug', 'Kenneth', 'hopes', ""'ll"", 'survive', 'only', 'find', 'have', 'outer', 'body', 'experiences', 'can', 'posess', 'anyone', 'wreck', 'brutal', 'vengeance', 'wrong-doers', 'Surprisingly', 'well-filmed', 'well-acted', 'Red', 'Mist', 'violent', 'compelling', 'little', 'thriller', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'What', 'film', 'however', ""n't"", 'suspenseful', 'scary', 'least', 'then', 'again', ""n't"", 'fall', 'sort', 'typical', 'slasher', 'conventions', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'occasionally', 'along', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'Red', 'Mist', 'worthwhile', 'shocker', 'definitely', 'worth', 'giving', 'chance', 'gorgeous', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'running', 'around', 'underwear', 'alone', 'anything', 'worth', 'seeing']",Red Mist
