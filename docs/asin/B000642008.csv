858557,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000642008,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 13]","In my part of Virginia NASCAR is as common as Peanut Butter in a grocery store.  Everywhere you go, you are going to see it.  It is either on cars, on shirts, on billboards, or anywhere else that your eyes may wonder.  Most of the material still pays respect to the number ""3"" and the driver that will forever be missed.  It pulls people to the track to see that number and thankfully everyone can profit off the commercial success of this driver's death.  Sadly, ESPN also did this and the result was the ill-fated made-for-TV-movie, 3: The Dale Earnhardt Story starring the ""I need work bad"" actor, Berry Pepper.  Literally racing through the life of this legend, this film boasts a simple 88 minutes and vaguely covers whatever it can to give rabid fans just a taste of this man's life.  Instead of giving him the proper respect, ESPN uses clich&eacute;s and over-bearing family moments that just scream ""made-for-TV"".  With Pepper's accent fading in and out within races, you cannot help but laugh at this cheaply designed model created by director Russell Mulcahy.So, what went wrong with this film?  Since the word ""everything"" will not cover all of it, I will attempt to explain in some detail.  I cannot stress this fact enough that if an actor looks like the person that you are trying to portray, it does not mean that he or she will do a good job (see the Charlize Theron theory).  This goes for Barry Pepper, who just never really gave Earnhardt any personality.  I felt like I was watching the story of one of those paper cutout dolls.  Sure, his costumes and appearance would change, but nothing else would.  His motions and emotions were forced and never really felt like I was watching the life of NASCAR's greatest, but instead seeing an actor do an impersonation of someone that he admires.  Pepper would not have Executive Produced this film if he wasn't already an Earnhardt fan (or at least could see the $$ made from the death of a human).  The same could be said about the rest of the actors in this film.  The children felt and sounded like paper mache, never quite seeming that comfortable in front of the camera ... especially Dale Jr.  I felt as if a gust of wind could have made him cry.  In fact, all the performances in this film coupled with a gust of wind made me cry.As I mentioned earlier, the timing on this film seemed very off.  How can you successfully measure the power of a man in a short span of 88 minutes?  There is just no way that you are going to be able to cover the depth and emotional excitement in this short time.  So, the creative team behind this film chose to ignore these moments and extend the racing scenes.  The outcome was literally horrible.  There was no balance, there was no craft, there was nothing actually paying respect to this man.  The story is where I could see the minds of the cash hungry people just getting bigger and bigger because they were going to do a story about a man life that millions would want to see.  They would want to see it not because it was good, but because the Earnhardt name was solely attached to it.  For a non-NASCAR fan like myself, this was kind of sad.  How can you have the life of Howard Hughes pushing three hours, and NASCAR powerhouse Dale Earnhardt just 88 minutes?  I guess you can over compensate by giving the viewers some extra features to the DVD, but for me that just didn't work.  The story was sloppy and completely disgraced Earnhardt's name.Overall, this proved to me that if you give a bunch of rednecks a camera, this is the quality of work that they will produce.  This was one of the worst autobiographical stories that I have seen in a very long time, even for the likes of ""made for TV"" it was horrible.  There was nothing redeemable in this story that I could go back to friends or family and say, ""Well, this part was kinda neat"".  There was nothing of the sort here.  I walked away from the film with less of an understanding about Earnhardt and his NASCAR business.  Even if you are a huge NASCAR fan, I do not think you will see the value in this film.  I especially love reading other reviews that say that this was a great film, but lacked some major elements to Dale's life.  Isn't that like a double negative?  Good film, but somehow you forgot to mention this?  I think some are just too generous with this story.  I am sad that he died, but this is not the way to pay respect to the man's life.Grade: * out of *****",1,We ain't out there to make friends.,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,4449,"['part', 'Virginia', 'NASCAR', 'as', 'common', 'Peanut', 'Butter', 'grocery', 'store', 'Everywhere', 'go', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'cars', 'shirts', 'billboards', 'anywhere', 'else', 'eyes', 'may', 'wonder', 'Most', 'material', 'still', 'respect', 'number', '3', 'driver', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'missed', 'people', 'track', 'see', 'number', 'thankfully', 'everyone', 'can', 'profit', 'off', 'commercial', 'success', 'driver', 'death', 'Sadly', 'ESPN', 'also', 'did', 'result', 'was', 'ill-fated', 'made-for-TV-movie', '3', 'Dale', 'Earnhardt', 'Story', 'starring', 'need', 'work', 'bad', 'actor', 'Berry', 'Pepper', 'Literally', 'racing', 'life', 'legend', 'film', 'simple', '88', 'minutes', 'vaguely', 'can', 'give', 'rabid', 'fans', 'just', 'taste', 'man', 'life', 'Instead', 'giving', 'proper', 'respect', 'ESPN', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'over-bearing', 'family', 'moments', 'just', 'scream', 'made-for-TV', 'Pepper', 'accent', 'fading', 'races', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'laugh', 'cheaply', 'designed', 'model', 'created', 'director', 'Russell', 'Mulcahy.So', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'film', 'word', 'everything', 'will', 'not', 'cover', 'will', 'attempt', 'explain', 'detail', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'fact', 'actor', 'person', 'are', 'trying', 'portray', 'not', 'mean', 'will', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'see', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'theory', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'who', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'gave', 'Earnhardt', 'personality', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'story', 'one', 'paper', 'cutout', 'dolls', 'Sure', 'costumes', 'appearance', 'would', 'change', 'nothing', 'else', 'would', 'motions', 'emotions', 'were', 'forced', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'life', 'NASCAR', 'greatest', 'instead', 'seeing', 'actor', 'do', 'impersonation', 'someone', 'Pepper', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'Executive', 'Produced', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'already', 'Earnhardt', 'fan', 'least', 'could', 'see', 'made', 'death', 'human', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'rest', 'actors', 'film', 'children', 'felt', 'sounded', 'paper', 'mache', 'never', 'quite', 'seeming', 'comfortable', 'front', 'camera', 'especially', 'Dale', 'Jr', 'felt', 'gust', 'wind', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'cry', 'fact', 'performances', 'film', 'coupled', 'gust', 'wind', 'made', 'cry.As', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'timing', 'film', 'seemed', 'very', 'off', 'How', 'can', 'successfully', 'measure', 'power', 'man', 'short', 'span', '88', 'minutes', 'just', 'way', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'cover', 'depth', 'emotional', 'excitement', 'short', 'time', 'So', 'creative', 'team', 'film', 'chose', 'ignore', 'moments', 'extend', 'racing', 'scenes', 'outcome', 'was', 'literally', 'horrible', 'was', 'balance', 'was', 'craft', 'was', 'nothing', 'actually', 'paying', 'respect', 'man', 'story', 'where', 'could', 'see', 'minds', 'cash', 'hungry', 'people', 'just', 'getting', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'story', 'man', 'life', 'millions', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'not', 'was', 'good', 'Earnhardt', 'name', 'was', 'solely', 'attached', 'non-NASCAR', 'fan', 'was', 'kind', 'sad', 'How', 'can', 'have', 'life', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'pushing', 'three', 'hours', 'NASCAR', 'powerhouse', 'Dale', 'Earnhardt', 'just', '88', 'minutes', 'guess', 'can', 'over', 'compensate', 'giving', 'viewers', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'story', 'was', 'sloppy', 'completely', 'disgraced', 'Earnhardt', 'name.Overall', 'proved', 'give', 'bunch', 'rednecks', 'camera', 'quality', 'work', 'will', 'produce', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'autobiographical', 'stories', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'even', 'likes', 'made', 'TV', 'was', 'horrible', 'was', 'nothing', 'redeemable', 'story', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'friends', 'family', 'say', 'Well', 'part', 'was', 'kinda', 'neat', 'was', 'nothing', 'sort', 'here', 'walked', 'away', 'film', 'less', 'understanding', 'Earnhardt', 'NASCAR', 'business', 'Even', 'are', 'huge', 'NASCAR', 'fan', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'will', 'see', 'value', 'film', 'especially', 'love', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'say', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'lacked', 'major', 'elements', 'Dale', 'life', ""n't"", 'like', 'double', 'negative', 'Good', 'film', 'somehow', 'forgot', 'mention', 'think', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'generous', 'story', 'am', 'sad', 'died', 'not', 'way', 'pay', 'respect', 'man', 'life.Grade', '*', '*****']",3: DALE EARNHARDT STORY

This movie gives a different twist on Earnhardt, one that allows us to see into the MAKING of the MAN.  Intimidated himself by his father, Dale intimately knew what intimidation meant.  It stands to reason you can't initimidate, as well as Dale did, without really ""knowing"" what it means.  This movie sheads light on that fact and opens our eyes to deeper demension of our beloved Dale3.  If his dad had not been hard on him, Dale may not have been the man we knew.  This movie also shows the Earnhardt Racing Legacy.  Not just Dale, but Ralph8, Dale3, and Dale Jr8.  It shows how racing was a part of Earnhardt blood ... the passion for it ... the words of their patriarch being passed through the generations ... maybe even to Dale III or Dale IV?  Ralph8 was a legend in his time when NASCAR racing wasn't as big as it is today.  Dale3 an even bigger legend today, and Dale Jr8 the legend to come.  This is something I'm sure most Earnhardt Racing fans have never contemplated until this film.  Sure, we know Dale's racing facts and I would like to relive more of the facts myself.  At the same time, I appreciate any new insight into the INTIMIDATOR.

858559,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000642008,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[9, 10]","""3: The Dale Earnhardt Story"" isn't going to win a lot of non-Nascar fans over to the sport, but as a biography, it is well-made, offers some believable insights on what made Earnhardt the often enigmatic person he was, and, in Barry Pepper, provides an eerily close approximation to the 'look' and 'feel' of the racing legend. Pepper will certainly receive an Emmy nomination for the role, and delivers such a powerful portrayal that you nearly forget how good the rest of the cast is.While Elizabeth Mitchell is more glamorous than the real Teresa Earnhardt, she is quite solid and believable in the role; to truly appreciate how important Teresa's intelligence and business acumen were to Dale, it would have required a much longer movie, and might have seriously tilted the story away from Dale's other relationships, and the balance that Pepper and director Russell Mulcahy achieved.Dale's early years come off best in the film, with a wonderful performance by J.K. Simmons as the inspirational Ralph Earnhardt. The grittiness and 'backwoods blue-collar' feel of Earnhardt's upbringing is well-conveyed, and reminiscent of ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and ""The River"". The film loses a bit of steam when Dale begins racing, and as he achieves success, a lot of memorable moments had to be edited out, or telescoped down, which has disappointed some Earnhardt fans. Considering the time and budget constraints, however, I found the story to be remarkably accurate.The young actors who portrayed Dale's children as adults should be singled out for recognition; race car driver/first-time actor Chad Mcumbee, while low-key, is pretty impressive as Dale Jr., conveying both a pride in his father, and frustration in being 'held back' so he could complete his education before being permitted to race; Corri English, while too cute, has an infectious smile and manner, and exhibits the Earnhardt joy of fast cars; best of all is newcomer Frank Glidden as oldest son Kerry, who, in a few brief scenes, offers a balanced, sensitive interpretation of the son Dale abandoned, finally winning his father's attention and respect, even as he sees Dale Jr. outshining him on the track. I look forward to seeing more of Glidden's work in future!While there will certainly be a more detailed and polished feature film about Earnhardt in the future, this ESPN production is not without it's own merits, and provides an entertaining, dramatic overview of the racing legend's life.",4,"Earnhardt Film Flawed, but Well-Made...",1103068800,"12 15, 2004",2004,2463,"['3', 'Dale', 'Earnhardt', 'Story', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'lot', 'non-Nascar', 'fans', 'sport', 'biography', 'well-made', 'believable', 'insights', 'what', 'made', 'Earnhardt', 'often', 'enigmatic', 'person', 'was', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'eerily', 'close', 'approximation', ""'look"", ""'feel"", 'racing', 'legend', 'Pepper', 'will', 'certainly', 'receive', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'role', 'delivers', 'such', 'powerful', 'portrayal', 'nearly', 'forget', 'how', 'good', 'rest', 'cast', 'is.While', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'more', 'glamorous', 'real', 'Teresa', 'Earnhardt', 'quite', 'solid', 'believable', 'role', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'how', 'important', 'Teresa', 'intelligence', 'business', 'acumen', 'were', 'Dale', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'much', 'longer', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'seriously', 'tilted', 'story', 'away', 'Dale', 'other', 'relationships', 'balance', 'Pepper', 'director', 'Russell', 'Mulcahy', 'achieved.Dale', 'early', 'years', 'come', 'off', 'best', 'film', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'inspirational', 'Ralph', 'Earnhardt', 'grittiness', 'blue-collar', 'feel', 'Earnhardt', 'upbringing', 'well-conveyed', 'reminiscent', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'River', 'film', 'bit', 'steam', 'when', 'Dale', 'racing', 'success', 'lot', 'memorable', 'moments', 'had', 'be', 'edited', 'out', 'telescoped', 'down', 'disappointed', 'Earnhardt', 'fans', 'Considering', 'time', 'budget', 'constraints', 'however', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'remarkably', 'accurate.The', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Dale', 'children', 'adults', 'should', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'recognition', 'race', 'car', 'driver/first-time', 'actor', 'Chad', 'Mcumbee', 'low-key', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'Dale', 'Jr.', 'conveying', 'pride', 'father', 'frustration', 'being', ""'held"", 'back', 'could', 'complete', 'education', 'being', 'permitted', 'race', 'Corri', 'English', 'too', 'cute', 'infectious', 'smile', 'manner', 'Earnhardt', 'joy', 'fast', 'cars', 'best', 'newcomer', 'Frank', 'Glidden', 'oldest', 'son', 'Kerry', 'who', 'few', 'brief', 'scenes', 'balanced', 'sensitive', 'interpretation', 'son', 'Dale', 'abandoned', 'finally', 'winning', 'father', 'attention', 'respect', 'even', 'Dale', 'Jr.', 'outshining', 'track', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'Glidden', 'work', 'future', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'more', 'detailed', 'polished', 'feature', 'film', 'Earnhardt', 'future', 'ESPN', 'production', 'not', 'own', 'merits', 'entertaining', 'dramatic', 'overview', 'racing', 'legend', 'life']",3: DALE EARNHARDT STORY

858567,AOK72ELBI86GF,B000642008,Poker Face,"[0, 0]","The movie had me hooked right from the beginning, as it followed three generations of Earnhardts; Ralph Earnhardt (Dale's dad), Dale himself, and Dale Jr.  The film only briefly focused on Dale Earnhardt's other children (mostly Kerry). In addition, Teresa Earnhardt was wonderfully played by Elizabeth Mitchell (she played Juliet in the ""Lost"" tv series), and has been in several feature films as well.Even though I'm more of a Jeff Gordon fan, I thought this was a well-acted, well-paced, and  above average made-for-tv movie (ESPN). Most of the acting was of  feature film quality. As well, most of the actors looked so much like their real-life counterparts, that it added tremendously to my enjoyment of it. The guy who played Dale Jr. was one of the real life racing instructors at the track that the actor's were training at. He had never acted before, but was hired because he looked and sounded so much like Dale Jr. Only the actor who played Darrell Waltrip was poor, and also looked nothing like him.Unfortunately, the ending was far too abrupt and short, and wasted almost all of the tension the movie had built up. It left me feeling cold and cheated. It's too bad they didn't cut out about five minutes from the movie, so that they could have added scenes that took place AFTER Dale's final race. I wanted to see the emotional reactions from the characters I had just spent ninety minutes with, so that the senseless loss would be more gut-wrenching and therefore more satisfying overall.DVD Special Features (Extras):Disc #1: Has two featurettes on it, both of which are above average as well. The making of the movie featurette was 35 minutes in length and wasn't just a puff piece like most making-of extras often are. It even showed some of the actors looping their dialogue-it was short, but was still better explained than I've seen it done anywhere else.There was also a 43 minute extra, which featured interviews with several stars and racing people, including the real Dale Earnhardt and Dale Jr.  It's really a shame that this featurette had more teary eyes and emotional impact than the ending of the actual movie. The movie would have been so much more satisfying if some of that emotion had been included at the end. After you watch the movie make sure you watch this EXTRA. I was much more satisfied after watching it and I know you will be too.Disc #2: Has a total of five different interviews, from the years: 1991, 1997 and 1998. Most are just with Dale Earnhardt, but some include his son, Dale Jr. They total 59 minutes in length and are quite good.Also included, are two ESPN Tv shows that Dale Earnhardt appeared on. They are: ""2 Minute Drill"" (21 minutes in length), and ""Ultimate Outdoors with Wayne Pearson"" (18 minutes in length). In ""2 minute Drill"", Dale just asks the contestants Nascar related questions, and in ""Ultimate Outdoors..."", we watch Dale hunt a deer. I found it creepy watching him wait for, and then shoot the deer. I knew he hunted, but I just didn't think he would like it so much. Very disturbing, even though they never showed the bullet entering each deer.Finally, there is actual (edited) ESPN race footage (in full screen) from four different races. However, they DIDN'T include Dale's only Daytona 500 win, or his 7th Nascar Winston Cup Championship clinching race. Very odd.Instead, the four included races are as follows:1) 1993- Atlanta (Hooter's 500): Last race of the 1993 season where Dale clinches his 6th Championship. (45 minutes)2) 1995- Sear's Point (Sonoma, Calif.)(Save Mart Supermarkets 300): Dale wins his first Nascar Winston Cup road race- with some nice roof-cam (etc.) shots. (28 minutes)3) 1999- Bristol (Goody's Headache Powder 500; and NO, it's NOT the Busch 500, like the Dvd menu says): Night race battle between Dale Earnhardt and Terry Labonte. (14 minutes)4)1999- IROC race-Round 3 from Michigan: 23rd running of the International Race Of Champions; featuring equal cars all painted in different colors. Dale was driving the blue car. Dale Jr. and Jeff Gordon were also in the race, along with 9 other drivers (not all from Nascar). Great finish.So, I'd give the movie 3 and a half stars on it's own (even with the disappointing ending), and the DVD extras push it up to 4 stars overall.",4,"Very good acting and DVD Extras, but had

In all honesty, it was a damn good movie!There were a few parts that weren't exactly correct, but they were things only true NASCAR/Earnhardt fans would have known. One scene shows Jake Elder, Dale's crew cheif leaving the team after his first Championship when actually, Doug Richert was Dale's crew chief during that season. Another scene of Dale and DW wrecking at Richmond in 1986 didn't really turn out the way they showed it. I have that race on VHS and Dale never jumped out of the car saying ""I didn't mean to wreck him! I just wanted to rattle his cage!"" In fact, Dale made that comment about Terry Labonte after the Bristol night race in 1999! One other thing I didn't care for was the way they showed Dale having nightmares and waking up in a cold sweat. Even Dr. Jerry Punch from ESPN said he didn't think that ever happened.Overall, the movie was a good depiction of Dale's life but there were a few things that were left out like the charity work Dale did and his freindship with Tim Richmond. But, then again, if it were up to me it would have been a miniseries!If you're an Earnhardt fan, you NEED to own this movie!",4,Not bad at all!,1105574400,"01 13, 2005",2005,1253,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'Dale', 'Earnhardt', 'mid', '80', 'other', '3', 'fan', 'was', 'ready', 'tear', 'movie', 'apart', 'honesty', 'was', 'damn', 'good', 'movie', 'were', 'few', 'parts', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'correct', 'were', 'things', 'only', 'true', 'NASCAR/Earnhardt', 'fans', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'One', 'scene', 'shows', 'Jake', 'Elder', 'Dale', 'crew', 'cheif', 'leaving', 'team', 'first', 'Championship', 'when', 'actually', 'Doug', 'Richert', 'was', 'Dale', 'crew', 'chief', 'season', 'scene', 'Dale', 'DW', 'wrecking', 'Richmond', '1986', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'showed', 'have', 'race', 'VHS', 'Dale', 'never', 'jumped', 'car', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'wreck', 'just', 'wanted', 'rattle', 'cage', 'fact', 'Dale', 'made', 'comment', 'Terry', 'Labonte', 'Bristol', 'night', 'race', '1999', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'way', 'showed', 'Dale', 'having', 'nightmares', 'waking', 'up', 'cold', 'sweat', 'Even', 'Dr.', 'Jerry', 'Punch', 'ESPN', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'happened.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'depiction', 'Dale', 'life', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'charity', 'work', 'Dale', 'did', 'freindship', 'Tim', 'Richmond', 'then', 'again', 'were', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'miniseries', ""'re"", 'Earnhardt', 'fan', 'NEED', 'own', 'movie']",3: DALE EARNHARDT STORY
858569,A2XLW4F7ETILS4,B000642008,RedSoxRock,"[0, 0]","I'm glad to see Earnhardt's memory being cherished and honored.  I think the actors all did a very good job.  And the first part of the movie, showing Earnhardt's tough upbringing, was exceptional (hats off to J.K. Simmons, but I'm used to that by now).My problems with the movie come during the later stages of it.Problem number one: Dale's relationship with Darrell Waltrip.  In reality, while they were fierce rivals, they were also very good friends.  In the movie, they are portrayed as despising each other's very existence.  The one scene that really galled me was when Waltrip bragged about telling the press they could ""write whatever you want about Earnhardt and his team, they can't read anyway"".  Are there any NASCAR fans that can imagine DW saying that, not just about another driver, but about a close friend? (which he was, regardless of the movie's inaccurate portrayal)Problem number two: Earnhardt's general actions off the track when he converses with other drivers.  While Dale was certainly a tough, strong-willed, independent guy, he wasn't the malcontent grump that all the other drivers hated in the movie.  With the exception of Neil Bonnet, no driver ever showed Dale any kind of respect, instead offering nothing but hostility.  Not even close to the truth.Problem number three: I do NOT like the way the movie ended.  They show clips of the 2001 Daytona 500, then show the crash clip.  When they show the crash, it starts just as Marlin gets into Dale, then just as Dale's car hits the wall, it fades to white, and there's a shot of Dale as a boy meeting his late father, presumably a ""racetrack in heaven type thing"".  In my opinion, this is just irresponsible, because it fails to show just how much his death hit home.  I would have included a montage showing the paramedics arriving, Earnhardt Jr. running to his dad's car after the race, the press release, the memorials all over the country, the silent third laps, Harvick's win at Atlanta, Earnhardt Jr.'s win at the Pepsi 400, etc.  Someone with no prior knowledge could even think NASCAR was glad to be rid of him, because all they see is a malcontent guy everyone hates getting killed.  The omission of tributes removes an essential piece of the movie-showing just how much Dale meant to NASCAR.  People should know about the silent third laps for the rest of the year.  People should know about Harvick, driving in just his third race, winning in Dale's car, and driving a victory lap with three fingers out the window and then dedicating it to Dale in victory lane.  People should know about Earnhardt Jr. winning the very next race at Daytona, with Waltrip right behind him, then the two of them, in tears, hugging on top of Earnhardt Jr.'s car.  All these things should have been included in the movie.",3,"Good idea, but unfortunately innacurate",1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,2795,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'Earnhardt', 'memory', 'being', 'cherished', 'honored', 'think', 'actors', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'showing', 'Earnhardt', 'tough', 'upbringing', 'was', 'exceptional', 'hats', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', ""'m"", 'used', 'now', '.My', 'problems', 'movie', 'come', 'later', 'stages', 'it.Problem', 'number', 'one', 'Dale', 'relationship', 'Darrell', 'Waltrip', 'reality', 'were', 'fierce', 'rivals', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'friends', 'movie', 'are', 'portrayed', 'despising', 'other', 'very', 'existence', 'one', 'scene', 'really', 'galled', 'was', 'when', 'Waltrip', 'bragged', 'telling', 'press', 'could', 'write', 'want', 'Earnhardt', 'team', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'anyway', 'Are', 'there', 'NASCAR', 'fans', 'can', 'imagine', 'DW', 'saying', 'not', 'just', 'driver', 'close', 'friend', 'was', 'regardless', 'movie', 'inaccurate', 'portrayal', 'Problem', 'number', 'two', 'Earnhardt', 'general', 'actions', 'track', 'when', 'other', 'drivers', 'Dale', 'was', 'certainly', 'tough', 'strong-willed', 'independent', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'malcontent', 'grump', 'other', 'drivers', 'hated', 'movie', 'exception', 'Neil', 'Bonnet', 'driver', 'ever', 'showed', 'Dale', 'kind', 'respect', 'instead', 'offering', 'nothing', 'hostility', 'Not', 'even', 'close', 'truth.Problem', 'number', 'three', 'do', 'NOT', 'way', 'movie', 'ended', 'show', 'clips', '2001', 'Daytona', '500', 'then', 'show', 'crash', 'clip', 'When', 'show', 'crash', 'just', 'Marlin', 'Dale', 'then', 'just', 'Dale', 'car', 'wall', 'white', 'shot', 'Dale', 'boy', 'meeting', 'late', 'father', 'presumably', 'racetrack', 'heaven', 'type', 'thing', 'opinion', 'just', 'irresponsible', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'death', 'hit', 'home', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'montage', 'showing', 'paramedics', 'arriving', 'Earnhardt', 'Jr.', 'running', 'dad', 'car', 'race', 'press', 'release', 'memorials', 'country', 'silent', 'third', 'laps', 'Harvick', 'win', 'Atlanta', 'Earnhardt', 'Jr.', 'win', 'Pepsi', '400', 'etc', 'Someone', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'could', 'even', 'think', 'NASCAR', 'was', 'glad', 'be', 'rid', 'see', 'malcontent', 'guy', 'everyone', 'getting', 'killed', 'omission', 'tributes', 'removes', 'essential', 'piece', 'movie-showing', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'Dale', 'meant', 'NASCAR', 'People', 'should', 'know', 'silent', 'third', 'laps', 'rest', 'year', 'People', 'should', 'know', 'Harvick', 'driving', 'just', 'third', 'race', 'winning', 'Dale', 'car', 'driving', 'victory', 'lap', 'three', 'fingers', 'out', 'window', 'then', 'dedicating', 'Dale', 'victory', 'lane', 'People', 'should', 'know', 'Earnhardt', 'Jr.', 'winning', 'very', 'next', 'race', 'Daytona', 'Waltrip', 'right', 'then', 'two', 'tears', 'hugging', 'top', 'Earnhardt', 'Jr.', 'car', 'things', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'movie']",3: DALE EARNHARDT STORY

Here are some of the films that missed my list:Citizen KaneForrest GumpEight Men OutAnimal HouseMy Mommy is having a babyGone with the WindBetter off DeadThe folks at ESPN were given the second most impossible task ever, make a movie about E. The toughest task will be to make a movie about me after I die, where would you even start casting? Back to E. He is a really a neat guy. This movie portrays him as the cuddly prankster we all got to know and love when he was driving in circles Sunday after Sunday. Is there anything in the world of sports more engrossing than guys driving in a circle for 4 hours? Only the tour de france can compare in terms of sheer excitement. In this movie, Barry ""Dr."" Pepper plays the god of automobiles, Tim Dayer(I think that's what people down here called him). He grows up in a backass town where no one has any hope of benefitting society in any way shape or form. His dad runs cars in circles and Timdayer thinks it looks like a lot of fun. He ends up doing the same thing and being better at it than his dad. He makes a lot of friends along the way because he's a good racer. Sometimes he makes other drivers mad because he passes them and wins (that is the object of this sport). I made a lot of other kids mad on the BMX circuit in Gretna with my style, but as Timdayer said, Rubbin your facin. In the end, E runs into a wall and dies.Now onto the movie about me. Where do you start? I personally think it would have to be a North and South type 10 hour mini series. You'd have to have my life broken up into five year periods or you'd run the risk of leaving out something that changed the world. You'd also open the network to countless complaints that my life wasn't covered properly. Some of the great scenes would be:1. Sparrow flies into my forehead and dies2. The great pickup on dodge(Natalie Portman would play the girl)3. Me dropping 43 against Rhombus4.

Hardcore, Nascar fans will still though find this amusing though!!! This movie tells about the legendary Dale Earnhart ""3"", giving you a basic overview and brief biography of his life, that was pretty good in fact!!! My little brother a Nascar fan has watched it already about 10 times, so I' ve pretty much mermorized the entire film!!!I myself didn't think that Barry Pepper, captured Earnhart's image that well either. He did a good job acting, but just jot the same as the man himself!!! Barry Pepper also with co producing the film as well, so Barry Pepper was a big contributer to the film!!! If you consider that they made this with a very low budget, you kind of see the genius!!! Their are some people who absolutely love this movie (Nascar fans), while others people that didn't like it or understand it!!!It may not have a lot of depth or bea movie like ""Aviator""!!! Really folks can you compare an academy award winning film with a made for tv movie!!! This movie is meant to help you understand Dale Earnhart and what he was as a person and driver!!! Dale Earnhart ""The Intimidator"", one of the legends of the sport, and the most entertaining driver to watch, as he  feared nobody!!! The movie shows his life from his childhood, with his dad Ralph Earnhart, until his final moments at Daytona, back in 2001!!!This movie is a Nascar fans, dream, but wait disc 2 is the real gold here!!!

858576,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B000642008,Wesley Mullins,"[6, 7]","""All I wanna do is race, Daddy.""  An oil-stained, greasy-headed teenage Dale Earnhardt explains to his father why he can't hold a job or maintain a relationship; he just wants to race.  ESPN's most recent foray into sports-themed biopics focuses on NASCAR's swashbuckling ""Man in Black"", a hero of the common man and an individual who helped nurture NASCAR's financial boom of the 1980s and 1990s.""3"" attempts to speak to the psychological make-up of racecar drivers.  Like his colleagues, Earnhardt has to learn to understand the dangers of the track (to protect himself and his expensive car), but he can't let those dangers cause him to drive scared.  Dale represses the fears anyone would experience in an industry where so many die doing their job.  The film shows how those repressed fears manifest themselves in nightmares and instability.But more than just speaking about drivers in general, ""3"" tries to nail down Dale Earnhardt, the man, and explain what made him one of the more loved and hated men in sports history.  He goes through wives, earns respect and disdain from his fellow drivers and remains an enigmatic mystery to most around him.  With his faults, Dale is shown to be a man of him word and remains loyal to his parents, his friend Neil Bonet and in his own ""Great Santini"" way, his children.A major element lacking from this feature concerns the impact Earnhardt had on the working class South.  In order to understand Earnhardt, people unfamiliar with NASCAR must first try to understand the people who loved him.  He was not just a sports figure; to legions of downtrodden southerners, Dale Earnhardt was a man who gave people hope.  When he died, a large group of people lost Elvis, Princess Diana and Martin Luther King, all rolled into one.  Any film about his life should give a large amount of attention to the fans who made him an icon and have insured his immortality.",4,A worthy effort from ESPN,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,1903,"['wan', 'na', 'do', 'race', 'Daddy', 'oil-stained', 'greasy-headed', 'teenage', 'Dale', 'Earnhardt', 'father', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'job', 'maintain', 'relationship', 'just', 'race', 'ESPN', 'most', 'recent', 'foray', 'sports-themed', 'biopics', 'focuses', 'NASCAR', 'swashbuckling', 'Man', 'Black', 'hero', 'common', 'man', 'individual', 'who', 'helped', 'nurture', 'NASCAR', 'financial', 'boom', '1980s', '1990s', '3', 'attempts', 'speak', 'psychological', 'make-up', 'racecar', 'drivers', 'colleagues', 'Earnhardt', 'learn', 'understand', 'dangers', 'track', 'protect', 'expensive', 'car', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'dangers', 'cause', 'drive', 'scared', 'Dale', 'fears', 'anyone', 'would', 'experience', 'industry', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'die', 'doing', 'job', 'film', 'how', 'repressed', 'fears', 'manifest', 'nightmares', 'more', 'just', 'speaking', 'drivers', 'general', '3', 'tries', 'nail', 'down', 'Dale', 'Earnhardt', 'man', 'explain', 'what', 'made', 'one', 'more', 'loved', 'hated', 'men', 'sports', 'history', 'wives', 'earns', 'respect', 'disdain', 'fellow', 'drivers', 'enigmatic', 'mystery', 'most', 'faults', 'Dale', 'shown', 'be', 'man', 'word', 'loyal', 'parents', 'friend', 'Neil', 'Bonet', 'own', 'Great', 'Santini', 'way', 'children.A', 'major', 'element', 'lacking', 'feature', 'impact', 'Earnhardt', 'had', 'working', 'class', 'South', 'order', 'understand', 'Earnhardt', 'people', 'unfamiliar', 'NASCAR', 'must', 'first', 'try', 'understand', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'sports', 'figure', 'legions', 'downtrodden', 'southerners', 'Dale', 'Earnhardt', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'people', 'hope', 'When', 'died', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'lost', 'Elvis', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'rolled', 'one', 'film', 'life', 'should', 'give', 'large', 'amount', 'attention', 'fans', 'who', 'made', 'icon', 'have', 'insured', 'immortality']",3: DALE EARNHARDT STORY
