If you've seen the movie ""Blood In, Blood Out"", then you should definitely see this one... if you haven't seen either one, then i reccommend you buying them both as a combo pack or separately (if you want to save $$)...I don't know which one i love more out of the two, because i know i've watched each movie more then 30 times... Both movies are pretty similar to each other... but ""Blood In, Blood Out"" kinda focuses on the 3 brothers, and the paths each of them takes, where as ""American Me"" focuses on the paths of the main characters in this movie (like Santana, Puppet, Lil' Puppet, etc).. but not only does it show their lifestyles, but it also focuses on how its having an effect on their families, and how their families feel about the life that their kids are leading... ""American Me"" i think involves more of the family in this picture and culture (La Raza) then ""Blood In, Blood Out"" does... it also shows its origin, like the Pachuco's (Zoot Suit's, Zoot Suit riots).. This movie is pretty close to 5 stars in my book... To me i think it definitely is 1/2 star better then ""Blood In, Blood Out""...becuase this one seems to have alot more of a story line to it, and more characters its focusing on... both in and outside the prison walls..If you're not sure about owning it, rent it first... but i can pretty much guarantee that you'll eventually end up owning it.",4,"Great movie to own, 4 1/2 stars!!",1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,1469,"['definitely', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'own', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'should', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Blood', 'Blood', 'Out', 'then', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'then', 'i', 'reccommend', 'buying', 'combo', 'pack', 'separately', 'want', 'save', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'i', 'love', 'more', 'two', 'i', 'know', 'i', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'more', 'then', '30', 'times', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'similar', 'other', 'Blood', 'Blood', 'Out', 'kinda', '3', 'brothers', 'paths', 'where', 'American', 'Me', 'paths', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'Santana', 'Puppet', 'Lil', 'Puppet', 'etc', '..', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'lifestyles', 'also', 'how', 'having', 'effect', 'families', 'how', 'families', 'feel', 'life', 'kids', 'are', 'leading', 'American', 'Me', 'i', 'think', 'more', 'family', 'picture', 'culture', 'La', 'Raza', 'then', 'Blood', 'Blood', 'Out', 'also', 'origin', 'Pachuco', 'Zoot', 'Suit', 'Zoot', 'Suit', '..', 'movie', 'pretty', 'close', '5', 'stars', 'book', 'i', 'think', 'definitely', '1/2', 'star', 'better', 'then', 'Blood', 'Blood', 'Out', 'becuase', 'one', 'have', 'alot', 'more', 'story', 'line', 'more', 'characters', 'focusing', 'prison', 'walls..If', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'owning', 'rent', 'first', 'i', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'owning']",American Me

Struggling to maintain their power. This is the first one I recall dealing with the Latinos in East L.A.Here's the scoop. The film begins with the Zoot Suit riots in L.A. after WWII. The riot introduces us to the mother and father of Santana Montoyo. Shoot ahead a few years and we meet Santana (Edward James Olmos) as a teenager on the rise with a gang. He gets into some trouble and lands in the joint where he solidifies his power both inside and outside of prison. After 18 years he's set free and life outside proves to be fraught with its own challenges.This is a decent movie. It's Olmos' directing debut for a feature length film. Probably the best angle here is when Satana is released from prison. Here is a man who has done much to maintain a high degree of power and respect but, since his formative years have been spent inside prison, he is socially very awkward when he hits the real world. He meets a local gal and is simply at odds as to how to be with her, have normal sex and a normal relationship. They say, when trying to profile a serial killer, you can nail down much about him except when it comes to his age. Because if he's done time, his social clock has stopped, and that is what's happening here. He tries to adjust with a calm assuredness but his view of things is too skewed. Much of the rest of the story deals with his struggle to maintain his empire. Not really much new there.Some of the script and directing are a bit heavy handed and the pace gets a bit uneven in parts, but, overall, this is a good entry into the genre. The soundtrack is cool. Olmos does a good job in his role as does William Forsythe as Santana's buddy J.D.

Add in the bathroom/drug smuggling scenes and you may be squirming in your seat for more reasons than a slow pace.In addition, many older actors can play characters in their twenties. Even those that have obvious hairline issues (see the later Porky's movies) seem to pull it off. Edward James Olmos is one man who should never even try. He looks like he was born fifty. He also plays the lead with the charisma of a sullen rock.In addition to the miscasting and sodomy, American Me suffers from serious script issues. It simply takes at face value the characters contention that they are king of the world. They are not. It is one thing for the characters themselves to be misguided (as they are most certainly are) but the movie itself seems not to realize what big losers these guys are. Sure, they are king of the cellblock. Hurrah, that is like being voted carnie of the month.A good first 45 minutes or so quickly melts into under acted pathos (Nobody emotes in this movie, cause they are all tough guys see.) and misguided plot twists (the whole taking on the mob bit was horribly done).

724069,AVUZRNQBB3S6G,B0000714BS,Keith Nichols,"[0, 0]","This is a powerful movie, perhaps made more powerful when viewed in combination with the behind-the-scenes documentary that comes on the Blu-ray disk.  Besides showing how some LA gangs were brought  to a truce to aid in producing American Me, the documentary notes that during or shortly after the shooting of the film, some of the gang members enlisted as extras were shot down, as well as the lady, a former gang member, whose adult life had been spent in the barrio trying to mediate among the gangs.  She had appeared in a small role in the film.  In other words, a temporary truce doesn't slow down business as usual in the east LA barrio.Another point brought home by the documentary is that kids reared in the barrio literally cannot see far enough to glimpse a life other than that ruled by gang culture.  They are born into families whose other members are or were active gang members, and every street they pass down, every school they attend, every business establishment they visit, every person they see is connected with or influenced by the gangs.  Their gang becomes their religion in a way that effectively makes them citizens of a nation other than the United States.

724070,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B0000714BS,LadyLestat,"[11, 12]","This movie gave me nightmares for a week. Seriously, I felt physically ill while watching this movie. It's been a long time since I saw a movie this graphic in nature. Frankly, it's not for the squeamish or overly sensitive crowd. With that being said, it's a typical prison drama. You pretty much have the usual rape, death by shankings, and rioting scenes. To this day, I have never seen a prison movie that ended on a good note, and I certainly can't remember anything good about this one either. This movie was just sad and depressing from start to finish. Edward James Olmos plays a youth who's life is a downward spiral soon as he's sent to a youth detention center. Of course, he's raped there by another male youth (which he kills). From there, he gains respect, but he also gains a sure ticket into prison as soon as he turns 18. This movie is sad because even after he gets out of prison he can't seem to make it on the outside or blend into society because he's been locked away for so long, and he still has that prison mentality. Ultimately that leads to his demise. That's pretty much what this movie is about..nothing real impressive! I do think what pushes it over the edge is the brutality of the rape scenes. I must admit watching a man being tied down and gang raped by 4 inmates was enough to haunt me for a while.

He immediately hooks up with his gang cronies looking to expand La Eme business (Forsythe is especially memorable as J.D., based on real-life former LE member Joe ""Peg Leg"" Morgan) and even falls for a woman along the way.

724075,A2SXGE7QAO5T7M,B0000714BS,"Migzilla ""TMM""","[5, 6]","While this is one of my favorite movies, there were many scenes in it that bothered me.  I was very pleased to finally see a good movie about Chicanos growing up in America.  It's easy to look at these characters and call them stupid.  However, one must keep in mind that they grew up in a place where they and their parents were hated because of their skin color.  No, it doesn't justify joining a gang and selling drugs.  But in the end, who is more wrong?Santana's parents were zoot suiters.  I'm willing to bet a lot of people who watched this movie didn't even know what really happened to zoot suiters in those days (not that I'm saying this movie is a history book).  I also realize there are always at least two sides to a story.  But anyway, the so called ""zoot suit riots"" were about the ""heroic"" sailors beating these zoot suiters up (many of them were only kids) and putting them ""in their place"".  The cops were ""most helpful"" and arrested them (zoot suiters) after they were beaten.Time passes, but little changes.  Children were born to them and grew up poor, without hope and with lots of anger.  What are they to do?  No, they are not victims, but they are also not stupid kids who chose a life of crime when they had so much going for them.  What did they have going for them?Santana, Mundo, and JD end up in juvie and eventually prison.  They formed one of most powerful prison gangs known as ""La Eme"".  In their mind, they are a success story.  They are doing what think is right for their people.  They are protecting their people in prison and controlling the drug trade that already existed.Santana eventually meets a woman who he takes an interest in.  It is through her that he realizes he is two people.  One is the one she loves.  He's the innocent one who is like a child and knows little about the outside world.  The other is evil and is the head of a powerful gang.  And a certain point in the movie, Santana feels there is no hope for him.  He's all grown up now and knows nothing more than his life in prison.  He even realizes he's not 100% Chicano.I would have liked this movie more than Scarface and The Godfather if it weren't for some VERY disturbing scenes.  Don't get me wrong, I realize this is a prison movie.  However, IMO, there were a few things this movie should have cut out or shortened.  The rape scenes (there were at least 3) were MUCH, MUCH longer than necessary.I think Santana summed this movie up best when he said the following: ""You know, a long time ago, two best homeboys, two kids, were thrown into juvie.  They were scared, and they thought they had to do something to prove themselves.  And they did what they had to do.  They thought they were doing it to gain respect for their people, to show the world that no one could take their class from them.  No one had to take it from us, ese.

At length,  creating or joining a clique or gangmay facilitate or solve the problem of  seeking  one's ownidentity, purpose in life, and place in society at large.Clearly, to a lesser or greater degree, viewers will relate topeer-pressure scenarios, whether as part of the military, workingfor a company, an association, a community organization, etc.Edward James Olmos, plays the leader of the eMe, spotlesslyportraying the leader who is highly sensitive and aware of whatconstitutes leadership, which is the importance in creating,maintaining a particular image for success in the clique, which isto say in controlling perceptions at large, to command as well therespect of rival group members.He is great at this, having graduated to the boss position from a""professional"" track record, extending  from youth to adulthood,always with the same particular type of people or memberscomprising his organization, or those of rivals.William Forsythe, (also seen in Gotti, for example) has an equallyfascinating appearance  throughout the movie, as a no-nonsensegangster.The cinematography is impeccable, as is the case with the sound,and musical accompaniment or soundtrack, with subtitles and a truewide-screen.There is a fair bit of gang jargon throughout, despite thesubtitles will  mystify viewers.There are a few eyebrow raisers, such as the thousands of junkiesscattered across cities, that rely on the toxicity of thesubstance they consume, or the horrific scenes.In gangs or cliques, nobody is above the clan's or clique'scommandments, including the top dog, as the disciplined membersare pigeon-holed into a lifestyle (they often know of no other)and as such, become dependent professionals in both behavior andconduct after a period of time -  their reactions to any deviancebeing mechanical, and automatic. This upbringing and lifestyle, orbelief system, can be larger than life, larger than what humanssometimes  can control themselves.The gang aspect, from an educational point of view, is perhapsoverdone, by specifically underlining rival factions, of LaPrimera St., 18th St, Hazard, Nuestra Familia, the Whites, theBlacks, Italians.There is also a litany of detention centers listed, such asFolsom, Chino, Soledad, Vacaville, etc. The business motives areclearly explained,  from extortion, sex, gambling, substances.Perhaps the downfall of a leader is being out of touch withmembers, either for love, passion, lack of experience in dealingwith distractions, resulting in a shaky adherence to  gangcommandments.A strenth  of the movie, is the historical accuracy and concernfor an entire community in face of other  communities that werewell established in USA, the resulting tensions and the challengesfor acceptance.It also is highly original and brave in not shying away fromshowing the ugly reality as it is.The movie is perhaps too specific, in demonstrating the inmatelifestyle in various aspects.",5,"Uncommonly  absorbing, introspective movie about cliques, clans",1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,3124,"['American', 'Me', '1992', 'uncommonly', 'absorbing', 'introspectivemovie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'dealing', 'gangs', 'dealing', 'subjectof', 'one', 'own', 'identity', 'face', 'other', 'individuals', 'other', 'groups', 'other', 'cliques', 'length', 'creating', 'joining', 'clique', 'gangmay', 'facilitate', 'solve', 'problem', 'seeking', 'one', 'ownidentity', 'purpose', 'life', 'place', 'society', 'large.Clearly', 'lesser', 'greater', 'degree', 'viewers', 'will', 'relate', 'topeer-pressure', 'scenarios', 'part', 'military', 'workingfor', 'company', 'association', 'community', 'organization', 'etc.Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'leader', 'eMe', 'spotlesslyportraying', 'leader', 'who', 'highly', 'sensitive', 'aware', 'whatconstitutes', 'leadership', 'importance', 'creating', 'maintaining', 'particular', 'image', 'success', 'clique', 'isto', 'say', 'controlling', 'perceptions', 'large', 'command', 'as', 'well', 'therespect', 'rival', 'group', 'members.He', 'great', 'having', 'graduated', 'boss', 'position', 'professional', 'track', 'record', 'extending', 'youth', 'adulthood', 'always', 'same', 'particular', 'type', 'people', 'memberscomprising', 'organization', 'rivals.William', 'Forsythe', 'also', 'seen', 'Gotti', 'example', 'equallyfascinating', 'appearance', 'movie', 'no-nonsensegangster.The', 'cinematography', 'impeccable', 'case', 'sound', 'musical', 'accompaniment', 'soundtrack', 'subtitles', 'truewide-screen.There', 'fair', 'bit', 'gang', 'jargon', 'thesubtitles', 'will', 'mystify', 'are', 'few', 'eyebrow', 'raisers', 'such', 'thousands', 'junkiesscattered', 'cities', 'rely', 'toxicity', 'thesubstance', 'consume', 'horrific', 'scenes.In', 'gangs', 'cliques', 'nobody', 'clan', ""clique'scommandments"", 'including', 'top', 'dog', 'disciplined', 'membersare', 'pigeon-holed', 'lifestyle', 'often', 'know', 'other', 'such', 'become', 'dependent', 'professionals', 'behavior', 'andconduct', 'period', 'time', 'reactions', 'deviancebeing', 'mechanical', 'automatic', 'upbringing', 'lifestyle', 'orbelief', 'system', 'can', 'be', 'larger', 'life', 'larger', 'what', 'can', 'control', 'themselves.The', 'gang', 'aspect', 'educational', 'point', 'view', 'perhapsoverdone', 'specifically', 'underlining', 'rival', 'factions', 'LaPrimera', 'St.', '18th', 'St', 'Hazard', 'Nuestra', 'Familia', 'Whites', 'theBlacks', 'Italians.There', 'also', 'litany', 'detention', 'centers', 'listed', 'such', 'asFolsom', 'Chino', 'Soledad', 'Vacaville', 'etc', 'business', 'motives', 'areclearly', 'explained', 'extortion', 'sex', 'gambling', 'downfall', 'leader', 'being', 'touch', 'withmembers', 'either', 'love', 'passion', 'lack', 'experience', 'dealingwith', 'distractions', 'resulting', 'shaky', 'adherence', 'gangcommandments.A', 'strenth', 'movie', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'concernfor', 'entire', 'community', 'face', 'other', 'communities', 'werewell', 'established', 'USA', 'resulting', 'tensions', 'challengesfor', 'acceptance.It', 'also', 'highly', 'original', 'brave', 'not', 'shying', 'away', 'fromshowing', 'ugly', 'reality', 'is.The', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'too', 'specific', 'demonstrating', 'inmatelifestyle', 'various', 'aspects']",American Me

The voiceovers - You Ride, Behind Pride, Thinking you can hide; the music - the killing of one of Santana's own accompanied by the desperate ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood""; the wealth of expression on the actors' faces - as when Santana learns his mother has died; all add up to create an extraordinary atmosphere.

All I could say is that I pray I never have to sit through this wannabee classic again. At a time in our lives when mexican-americans are struggling to earn respect in this great nation,Edward James Olmos decides to come out with a movie that lets moviegoers of all races and colors see what mexican americans are supposedly like in everyday life. Let's see now....prison sex,babies drinking beer,teenage drive-by shooters,early-aged heroin users,brown on black killings,and so on!!!! Mr Olmos claimed he was only sending a message when making this film. Sadly,he just never said it wouldn't be positive. Let us not forget that several consultants to the film were murdered during its opening weeks by individuals who may have been offended by this movie. Mr Olmos himself was the target of threats as well.

There are two MAYBE three characters in this movie that have some depth but most are generic sterotypes, but since the script has such transparent and worthless dialogue it's almost not even the actors fault (almost).
