871701,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B0006OJH0E,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[23, 24]","This is a movie story that deals with two young boys, two families, and their two different worlds.  El Bola is the nickname for Pablo and he encounters a new boy, Alfredo, at school and their friendship drives them to discover each other's world.Pablo's WorldPablo comes from a home where communication is sparse as he lives with his abusive authoritarian father, a weak mother, and a grandmother whose need for personal care only burdens the situation.  Pablo's father works in a hardware store and Pablo is often confined to work there also.  Before Pablo was born, the family lost a favorite son and now the frustration, anger and resentment is taken out on Pablo, who is brutally mistreated by his father.It is only after the climactic abusive attack that Pablo runs away to Alfredo's family who then seek avenues to help the boy.  We don't know too much what happens after the abuse is discovered.  We do see Pablo discuss with the authorities the true horror he suffered.On the other hand, Alfredo's family life is more caring and with communication.  An interest is shown in family structuring.  Contrary to the loving family life, Alfredo's father is a tattoo artist, considered a darker profession.  He also gives his young son a tattoo.Pain and Scarring in different waysAccording to the director, Archero Manas, the movie is not about child abuse, but he said the parellism is the two different ways pain and scaring are inflicted.  He said that the father who is a tattoo artist gives his young son a tattoo which is indicative of pain and scarring, while the abusive father inflicts pain and scarring through violence.The DVD is clear and crisp with readable subtitles.  Included is ""The Making of El Bola"" as the children, cast talk about their characters while the director gives insight to his film.  The movie has won numerous awards, including La Goya in 2000, which is equivalent to an Academy Award.

871702,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,B0006OJH0E,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[0, 0]","Films thrive on parallel universes, and writer/director Achero Ma&ntilde;as' El Bola takes full advantage of contrasting two fathers and their family lives through the eyes of their sons. Although the Spanish film won four Goya Awards in 2000 for Best Emerging Director, Best Emerging Actor, Best Screenplay, and Best Film, it was ignored by American theaters until now.. Although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of Spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse, the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching.Part of what makes the film compelling are the first rate performances by its young cast. Pablo aka El Bola (Juan Jos&eacute; Ballesta) is a twelve year old living in Madrid. His life radically changes when he meets Alfredo (Pablo Gal&aacute;n) a new boy who joins his class. What follows is a comparison of two parallel family situations that remain ambiguous enough to keep the careful viewer wondering what exactly is going on in the  families and the motivation for Pablo's father Mariano's (Manuel Mor&oacute;n) extreme violence towards his young son.In contrast is the homelife of Alfredo, a bohemian mix of couples that are willing to show their child the love and affection  that is missing in Pablo's life.Alfredo's family atmosphere is completely foreign to Pablo--a much more relaxed, loving, and accepting bohemian lifestyle that appeals greatly to the boy. Exactly what the relationships are between the adults in Alfredo's family remain unstated--a gay subtext may or may not exist, as the family certainly are friends with many homosexuals who have died from AIDS. Alfredo's father, Jos&eacute; (Alberto Jim&eacute;nez), makes a living as a tattoo artist and anchors the extended family. The filmmaker leaves his sexuality ambiguous, which is irrelevant to the two boys--he's a levelheaded, caring father who has their best interests at heart.El Bola is at its heart a story of friendship between two young boys and the devestating effects of parental abuse. While the film is not always easy to watch it is very well made and well worth a viewing if not only for the story presented but for the questions it raises.Film Movement chose this film as its debut installment and presents the film with a making of documentary and the short film More by Mark Osborne.",4,Parallel Lives,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,2360,"['Films', 'thrive', 'parallel', 'universes', 'writer/director', 'Achero', 'Ma', 'ntilde', 'El', 'Bola', 'full', 'advantage', 'contrasting', 'two', 'fathers', 'family', 'eyes', 'sons', 'Spanish', 'film', 'won', 'four', 'Goya', 'Awards', '2000', 'Best', 'Emerging', 'Director', 'Best', 'Emerging', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Film', 'was', 'ignored', 'American', 'theaters', 'now..', 'largely', 'heavy-handed', 'indictment', 'parental', 'failings', 'indifference', 'Spanish', 'social', 'workers', 'legal', 'system', 'towards', 'child', 'abuse', 'film', 'ambiguities', 'make', 'well', 'watching.Part', 'what', 'film', 'compelling', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'performances', 'young', 'cast', 'Pablo', 'aka', 'El', 'Bola', 'Juan', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Ballesta', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'living', 'Madrid', 'life', 'radically', 'changes', 'when', 'Alfredo', 'Pablo', 'Gal', 'aacute', 'new', 'boy', 'who', 'class', 'What', 'comparison', 'two', 'parallel', 'family', 'situations', 'remain', 'ambiguous', 'enough', 'keep', 'careful', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'what', 'exactly', 'going', 'families', 'motivation', 'Pablo', 'father', 'Mariano', 'Manuel', 'Mor', 'oacute', 'extreme', 'violence', 'young', 'son.In', 'contrast', 'homelife', 'Alfredo', 'bohemian', 'mix', 'couples', 'are', 'willing', 'show', 'child', 'love', 'affection', 'missing', 'Pablo', 'life.Alfredo', 'family', 'atmosphere', 'completely', 'foreign', 'Pablo', 'much', 'more', 'relaxed', 'loving', 'accepting', 'bohemian', 'lifestyle', 'appeals', 'greatly', 'boy', 'Exactly', 'what', 'relationships', 'are', 'adults', 'Alfredo', 'family', 'remain', 'unstated', 'gay', 'subtext', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'exist', 'family', 'certainly', 'are', 'friends', 'many', 'homosexuals', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'AIDS', 'Alfredo', 'father', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Alberto', 'Jim', 'eacute', 'living', 'tattoo', 'artist', 'anchors', 'extended', 'family', 'filmmaker', 'sexuality', 'ambiguous', 'irrelevant', 'two', 'boys', 'levelheaded', 'caring', 'father', 'who', 'best', 'interests', 'heart.El', 'Bola', 'heart', 'story', 'friendship', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'devestating', 'effects', 'parental', 'abuse', 'film', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'watch', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'viewing', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'presented', 'questions', 'raises.Film', 'Movement', 'chose', 'film', 'debut', 'installment', 'film', 'making', 'documentary', 'short', 'film', 'More', 'Mark', 'Osborne']",El Bola
871703,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B0006OJH0E,.fgd,"[0, 0]","The  problem with this film is that it is low key. Even the adults are subdued like automotoms. The kids he plays dare-devils with on the train-track lack  exhuberance ; escaping a near-miss from a train should elicit a greater burst of excitement. His friend Alfredo was stuffy and subdued even before he became troubled after the other kids told him what everyone knew. The film is dead pan and takes a long time to get moving. Then when it does its because Alfredo's parents don't want to get involved when the evidence is clear enough , even from being sued by the father. Admittedly the boy plays stoic to normalise relations with his peers and his life but given the list of abuse listed at the end he is too young not to be acting out and the film does not show hints of this , which would have been of interest. It is directed as though weighed down by concern and a certain intellectual disassociation so there is no reality with the busy carefree lives people lead . It lacks humour except for Alfredos little brother.Nevertheless it is an intelligent film and well-acted especially by the actor playing Pablo. Its point is that domestic abuse among children goes on undetected because they are such stoics. The film is stoic is the problem !! ts fault is that the producer then exaggurates the extents of Pablo's abuse to bring home to the viewer the unimaginable hardship stored inside the child. Less would have been more just seeing and hearing Pablo finally blurting out the truth. The sensational proofs blow the film's integrity.

""A New Yorker""","[7, 7]","I've also seen movies like ""Boys of St. Vincent"" and ""Song for a raggy boy"", but this movie about child abuse is just different. El Bola is played by Juan Jos? Ballesta (my favorite young actor) who also appears in the interesting and touching ""Planta 4a"". He has also a very small role in a movie a mentioned before: ""Song for a raggy boy"" (as the young friend of the teacher in the flash backs).""El Bola"" makes you realize that this might be your neighbor boy's story. If you start watching the movie, you feel that something's wrong with El Bola (""Pellet"") but you just don't know what. And I guess that's one of the strengths of this movie: it's not only told in a natural way, but it's rather suggestive. And a lot of people are disappointed that the movie's just cut after 88 minutes without a proper ending, but I think that's the way it goes in real life too : a life/story is like a roller coaster: it has it ups and downs, but the only thing that matters is where it ends.Well directed, above all keeping the violence within strict proportions to the import of the story, and in general good interpretations which do not tend to unnecessarily exaggerate the crude and difficult situations being enacted.I hope that this younger generation of Spanish directors, such as Achero Ma?as and of course Fernando Le?n de Aranoa (Los Lunes al Sol, qv, also with Nieve de Medina) can keep up the good work in the sociological sphere with real human stories to tell.",4,"""El Bola"" makes you realize that this might be your neighbor boy's story.",1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,1465,"[""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'movies', 'Boys', 'St.', 'Vincent', 'Song', 'raggy', 'boy', 'movie', 'child', 'abuse', 'just', 'different', 'El', 'Bola', 'played', 'Juan', 'Jos', 'Ballesta', 'favorite', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'also', 'interesting', 'touching', 'Planta', '4a', 'also', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'movie', 'mentioned', 'Song', 'raggy', 'boy', 'young', 'friend', 'teacher', 'flash', 'backs', 'El', 'Bola', 'realize', 'might', 'be', 'neighbor', 'boy', 'story', 'start', 'watching', 'movie', 'feel', 'something', 'wrong', 'El', 'Bola', 'Pellet', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'guess', 'one', 'strengths', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'told', 'natural', 'way', 'rather', 'suggestive', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'just', 'cut', '88', 'minutes', 'proper', 'ending', 'think', 'way', 'real', 'life', 'too', 'life/story', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ups', 'downs', 'only', 'thing', 'matters', 'where', 'ends.Well', 'directed', 'keeping', 'violence', 'strict', 'proportions', 'import', 'story', 'general', 'good', 'interpretations', 'do', 'not', 'tend', 'unnecessarily', 'exaggerate', 'crude', 'difficult', 'situations', 'being', 'enacted.I', 'hope', 'younger', 'generation', 'Spanish', 'directors', 'such', 'Achero', 'Ma', 'course', 'Fernando', 'Le', 'n', 'de', 'Aranoa', 'Los', 'Lunes', 'al', 'Sol', 'qv', 'also', 'Nieve', 'de', 'Medina', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'good', 'work', 'sociological', 'sphere', 'real', 'human', 'stories', 'tell']",El Bola

871706,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0006OJH0E,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 3]","""El Bola"" is a powerful movie from Spain.  In 2000, it was director Achero Manas' first full-length feature after having directed a handful of short film projects.  It handles the powder keg issue of child abuse with realism.  Juan Jose Ballesta plays Pablo, nicknamed ""Pellet.""  At filming, I believe he was 12.  Juan had played on Spanish TV, but this was his first feature.  He has worked consistently in Spanish films in the seven years since.  He breaks your heart with those eyes that reflect the joy, innocence and love of a child and contrasts with the utter fear for his life.  The culminating incident where he spits in his father's face blows the lid off.  We know what's coming and watch as the helpless mother flails about pathetically.Pablo's best friend is Alfredo, played by Pablo Galan.  Galan was chosen from 1,600 children who auditioned.  He had no previous acting experience.  He's a bit heavyset; & his Alfredo is an oddball & loner.  Galan was well chosen.  He moves effortlessly between the young adolescent alienation, to wild abandon as he crashes the amusement park rides, to sober contemplation as he sees the family friend dying of AIDS.Beside Ballesta's Pablo, Alberto Jimenez makes the greatest impression as Jose, the father of best friend Pablo.  Jose is a tattoo artist.  We first view him as wild, tattooing a dragon on fat man's back.  As his screen time increases, we see a father who listens to his family, treats his wife & children well and cares about them and his friends.  Jose stands up for Pablo, taking risks on the boys' behalf.  By the film's end, he is our hero.  With six films shot in 2007, Jimenez has had a busy career in Spanish cinema since this film from 2000.Our villain is Pablo's father Mariano, played by Manuel Moron.  The Film Movement DVD explains that the character is sad because of the loss of his first son.  However, no explanation suffices for the loveless home life this father creates.  I found it interesting that the Film Movement DVD lists stage training and productions for Moron in Spain & Argentina.  Moron plays this controlling parent perfectly; and we hate him for it.Of the smaller roles, all characters are well directed and fill the film realistically.  Ana Wagener, who to me looks a bit like Melissa Etheridge's Spanish sister, plays the social worker Laura who advises Alfredo's family on how to handle the situation.  Maximo Jimenez plays Pablo's friend Cobeta, a good looking lad who plays a game of rushing onto the railroad tracks before an oncoming train to grab a bottle.  Gloria Munoz plays Aurora, Pablo's helpless mother who cannot stop her husband's abuse.The screenplay leaves an open-ended conclusion.  The events have been so disturbing that perhaps we all hope for the best.  We could either interpret that things will get better for Pablo or that the father will get away with his domestic abuse.  Perhaps in this situation, no one can actually win.  This is a powerful film that should be viewed by mature audiences.  May our angels around the world help children from every culture who find themselves helpless and attacked.",4,Angels Around the World,1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,3127,"['El', 'Bola', 'powerful', 'movie', 'Spain', '2000', 'was', 'director', 'Achero', 'Manas', 'first', 'full-length', 'feature', 'having', 'directed', 'handful', 'short', 'film', 'projects', 'powder', 'keg', 'issue', 'child', 'abuse', 'realism', 'Juan', 'Jose', 'Ballesta', 'Pablo', 'nicknamed', 'Pellet', 'filming', 'believe', 'was', '12', 'Juan', 'had', 'played', 'Spanish', 'TV', 'was', 'first', 'feature', 'worked', 'consistently', 'Spanish', 'films', 'seven', 'years', 'heart', 'eyes', 'reflect', 'joy', 'innocence', 'love', 'child', 'contrasts', 'utter', 'fear', 'life', 'culminating', 'incident', 'where', 'father', 'face', 'lid', 'off', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'watch', 'helpless', 'mother', 'pathetically.Pablo', 'best', 'friend', 'Alfredo', 'played', 'Pablo', 'Galan', 'Galan', 'was', 'chosen', '1,600', 'children', 'who', 'auditioned', 'had', 'previous', 'acting', 'experience', 'bit', 'heavyset', 'Alfredo', 'oddball', 'loner', 'Galan', 'was', 'well', 'chosen', 'effortlessly', 'young', 'adolescent', 'alienation', 'wild', 'abandon', 'amusement', 'park', 'rides', 'sober', 'contemplation', 'family', 'friend', 'dying', 'AIDS.Beside', 'Ballesta', 'Pablo', 'Alberto', 'Jimenez', 'greatest', 'impression', 'Jose', 'father', 'best', 'friend', 'Pablo', 'Jose', 'tattoo', 'artist', 'first', 'view', 'wild', 'tattooing', 'dragon', 'fat', 'man', 'back', 'screen', 'time', 'increases', 'see', 'father', 'who', 'family', 'wife', 'children', 'well', 'cares', 'friends', 'Jose', 'up', 'Pablo', 'taking', 'risks', 'boys', 'behalf', 'film', 'end', 'hero', 'six', 'films', 'shot', '2007', 'Jimenez', 'had', 'busy', 'career', 'Spanish', 'cinema', 'film', '2000.Our', 'villain', 'Pablo', 'father', 'Mariano', 'played', 'Manuel', 'Moron', 'Film', 'Movement', 'DVD', 'character', 'sad', 'loss', 'first', 'son', 'However', 'explanation', 'suffices', 'loveless', 'home', 'life', 'father', 'found', 'interesting', 'Film', 'Movement', 'DVD', 'stage', 'training', 'productions', 'Moron', 'Spain', 'Argentina', 'Moron', 'controlling', 'parent', 'perfectly', 'hate', 'it.Of', 'smaller', 'roles', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'directed', 'fill', 'film', 'realistically', 'Ana', 'Wagener', 'who', 'bit', 'Melissa', 'Etheridge', 'Spanish', 'sister', 'social', 'worker', 'Laura', 'who', 'Alfredo', 'family', 'how', 'handle', 'situation', 'Maximo', 'Jimenez', 'Pablo', 'friend', 'Cobeta', 'good', 'looking', 'lad', 'who', 'game', 'rushing', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'oncoming', 'train', 'grab', 'bottle', 'Gloria', 'Munoz', 'Aurora', 'Pablo', 'helpless', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'husband', 'abuse.The', 'screenplay', 'open-ended', 'conclusion', 'events', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'disturbing', 'perhaps', 'hope', 'best', 'could', 'either', 'interpret', 'things', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'Pablo', 'father', 'will', 'get', 'away', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'Perhaps', 'situation', 'one', 'can', 'actually', 'win', 'powerful', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'mature', 'audiences', 'May', 'angels', 'world', 'help', 'children', 'culture', 'who', 'find', 'helpless', 'attacked']",El Bola
871707,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0006OJH0E,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[11, 11]","This multi-award-winning film tackles the difficult subject of domestic abuse and in particular a father's abusive relationship with his twelve-year-old son. The nature of this abuse is revealed slowly, so that like any outsider, we don't see the full extent of it until we've already formed opinions about both characters. The film contrasts their relationship with that of the boy's new friend at school, whose father is a tattoo artist and seems on the surface to be more potentially troublesome as a parent. But as we watch him with his son, we see how is firmness is an expression of his caring and love for the boy. The boys' two homes represent mirror worlds with contrasting emotional dynamics.The drama in the film emerges as the abusive father's treatment of his son becomes gradually apparent to his son's friend, and we become informed of the near inability of anyone outside the family to rescue him. There is no easy resolution to this dilemma, and we are left with a sense of urgency about this disturbing social problem. The performances of the two twelve-year-olds are wonderful, as they become friends, exploring the early stages of their growing independence.

It doesn't provide a feel-good experience, even with a happy ending, and most certainly it is not box office. With ""El Bola"" in 2000, some intrepid Spanish filmmakers took it on and didn't flinch. Their searing and sensitive low-budget movie, which indeed is uncomfortable to watch, won more than 30 top international awards, including four Goyas (Spain's Academy Award.) Its DVD release needs to be seen.The scenes of physical, emotional and verbal abuse of a 12-year-old boy by his father, while his enabling wife protests feebly, are unsparing. The young victim is befriended by a classmate whose parents provide a caring contrast and who discover the abuse. The boy is rescued, yet his shocking monologue at the end will leave you uneasy long after the credits roll. You come to realize that undetected child abuse is so common that it is occurring even as you watch. The cast and crew are flawless and their little movie is unbearably moving.",5,Spare the Rod,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,1063,"['Child', 'abuse', 'incidents', 'increase', 'year', 'uncomforable', 'parents', 'why', 'topic', 'rarely', 'filmed', ""n't"", 'provide', 'feel-good', 'experience', 'even', 'happy', 'ending', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'box', 'office', 'El', 'Bola', '2000', 'intrepid', 'Spanish', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'did', ""n't"", 'flinch', 'searing', 'sensitive', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'indeed', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'won', 'more', '30', 'top', 'international', 'awards', 'including', 'four', 'Goyas', 'Spain', 'Academy', 'Award', 'DVD', 'release', 'be', 'seen.The', 'scenes', 'physical', 'emotional', 'verbal', 'abuse', '12-year-old', 'boy', 'father', 'enabling', 'wife', 'protests', 'feebly', 'are', 'unsparing', 'young', 'victim', 'befriended', 'classmate', 'parents', 'provide', 'caring', 'contrast', 'who', 'discover', 'abuse', 'boy', 'rescued', 'yet', 'shocking', 'monologue', 'end', 'will', 'leave', 'uneasy', 'long', 'credits', 'roll', 'come', 'realize', 'undetected', 'child', 'abuse', 'so', 'common', 'occurring', 'even', 'watch', 'cast', 'crew', 'are', 'flawless', 'little', 'movie', 'unbearably', 'moving']",El Bola
