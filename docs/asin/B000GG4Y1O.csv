1003716,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000GG4Y1O,Dorrie Wheeler,"[11, 11]","This season Tori Spelling fans will have two new releases to choose from. Earlier this season Paramount released Beverly Hills 90210 The Complete First Season on DVD. Now her VH-1 original series So Notorious is available on DVD. The DVD release includes the entire series which consists of 10 episodes.The most surprising thing about So Notorious is just how funny the darn show is. On Beverly Hills 90210, Tori Spelling didn't get to show off her comedic chops. The actress has also starred in a handful of series themed Lifetime movies, so most people didn't know what Tori had to offer comedy wise.So Notorious can most easily be compared to the Kirstie Alley series Fat Actress. Similar to Fat Actress where Kirstie Alley starred as Kirstie Alley with actors cast as her friends, in So Notorious Tori stars as a fictional character named Tori, with actors playing the roles of her family and friends. In the series, Tori explores post 90210 life which includes dating, friends, family, tabloids and Beverly Hills life.There are some really funny moments in the series. The guys who want to hook up with her because her father is a famous producer. Some of the greatest scenes in the series include actress Lonnie Anderson who stars as Tori's mother KiKi in the series. Hands down one of the funniest episodes of the series is the episode ""Charitable."" In this episode, Tori takes a disadvantaged ""teen"" under her wing. Before she knows itshe is throwing the young girl a huge party. When the ""teen"" doesn't get her way she threatens to go to the tabloids. Things really come to a head when Tori learns the teen isn't a teen after all, she really is a grown woman.So Notorious is a cute show. The DVD set includes 9 episodes that aired and a 10th episode that never aired on the network. Special features include episode commentary, deleted scenes, outtakes and cast interviews.",5,Tori Spelling Is Funny!,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,1882,"['season', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'fans', 'will', 'have', 'two', 'new', 'releases', 'choose', 'Earlier', 'season', 'Paramount', 'released', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'DVD', 'Now', 'VH-1', 'original', 'series', 'So', 'Notorious', 'available', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'release', 'entire', 'series', '10', 'episodes.The', 'most', 'surprising', 'thing', 'So', 'Notorious', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'darn', 'show', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'show', 'off', 'comedic', 'chops', 'actress', 'also', 'starred', 'handful', 'series', 'themed', 'Lifetime', 'movies', 'so', 'most', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Tori', 'had', 'offer', 'comedy', 'Notorious', 'can', 'most', 'easily', 'be', 'compared', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'series', 'Fat', 'Actress', 'Similar', 'Fat', 'Actress', 'where', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'starred', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'actors', 'cast', 'friends', 'So', 'Notorious', 'Tori', 'fictional', 'character', 'named', 'Tori', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'family', 'friends', 'series', 'Tori', 'post', '90210', 'life', 'dating', 'friends', 'family', 'tabloids', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'moments', 'series', 'guys', 'who', 'want', 'hook', 'up', 'father', 'famous', 'producer', 'greatest', 'scenes', 'series', 'include', 'actress', 'Lonnie', 'Anderson', 'who', 'Tori', 'mother', 'KiKi', 'series', 'down', 'one', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'series', 'episode', 'Charitable', 'episode', 'Tori', 'disadvantaged', 'teen', 'wing', 'itshe', 'throwing', 'young', 'huge', 'party', 'When', 'teen', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'go', 'tabloids', 'Things', 'really', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'Tori', 'teen', ""n't"", 'teen', 'really', 'grown', 'woman.So', 'Notorious', 'cute', 'show', 'DVD', 'set', '9', 'episodes', 'aired', '10th', 'episode', 'never', 'aired', 'network', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'episode', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'cast', 'interviews']",N/A

She is fairly good at comedy (who knew?!?) and really pulls this off.She plays Tori Spelling who is living in an apartment that her parents paid for.  She has a roomate - Pete, and a GBFF - Sasan and a BBF - Janey.  She has a distant mother Kiki (is this really how her relationship with her real mother is like?) and a vertually non-existant visual relationship with her famous dad Aaron (they always comunicate via intercom).  Loni Anderson plays her mom and let me say she looks terrible - too much work done, but she was fantastic in this.Throughout the series, we see Tori and her friends in different situations.  In each episode there are 'flashbacks' to Tori's traumatic past which in themselves are quite funny.  There is the hilarious episode where Pete brings his girlfriend over to the apartment and Tori has to leave and the funny (yet sometimes annoying) episode where Tori becomes a big sister.Don't be prejudice before buying this.

1003730,A1WLKGF88IYVK0,B000GG4Y1O,Richard Lamery,"[35, 40]","First thing's first - how many Tori Spelling fans were really out there in the 90's? Just some teenagers who were addicted to Beverly Hills 90210 and probably sent her enough fan mail to suffocate a horse with. But I'd have to say she was one of the least popular members of that cast. She made a safe transition after this show to Lifetime television movies and independent films, but failed to have the bigtime Hollywood career she always wanted. How many fans can you possibly gain with movies like Scary Movie 2, A Friend to Die For, Co-Ed Call Girl, and Mother May I Sleep with Danger?So, probably the most interesting thing about her was her famous parents and what we could only imagine her life was like - on a megahit TV show about teens that wasn't very good while still experiencing all the same pratfalls as someone slightly more talented on a better show. Then moving onto a truly miserable career in TV obscurity, still being that name everyone knows without a great career to argue her name's worth being on the tip of our tongues. Her career may have just lived in infamy as Scream 2 being the best and brightest spot on her resume.That is, until 2006, when VH1 debuted her new reality-show-esque sitcom about chaotic distortions upon what must be her actual life. If there's one part Tori could win an award for playing - it's herself. Who could argue with that? Just one thing left to ponder: is the show any good?I happen to think it's very good.First of all, the show arrives in a sea of scripted reality-shot shows about pre-teen girls trying to make it in the music industry, snooty twenty-something's (that act like pre-teen girls- even the boys) working at high-fashion magazines, and teenagers just chillin' on the beach. God, when you consider the competition - this show is a genuine breath of fresh air. It has a lot of the same elements of those shows, only it's still a scripted sitcom and feels like it. Best of all, the 'characters' are smarter than those dumb kids on the beach, in the hills, and anywhere you can imagine (including MTV's once stellar The Real World) - even when they are playing dumb.So the key to this show is intelligence. And it has truly superior writing. What it does excellently, I think, is it sort of sees that niche that international Britcom success Absolutely Fabulous has in the American market, and picks up where Cybill and the last season of Roseanne left off trying to emulate AbFab, and succeeds in actually drowning the viewer in fads, trends, quirky characters, and controlled comedic performances. One of the great things about AbFab's cast were their ability to restrain themselves from going over the top, because the writing itself was as over the top as any given episode needed to feel. So, So NoTorious follows in that vein. Closely.It even manages to go from simply entertaining, to hilariously funny in some episodes. Most notably, ""Whole"" and ""Street."" This show is complexly written and it really deserves a pat on the back for being more than entertaining for some... It sort of fills the void of a really great TV show.

It's not a reality show. It's based on being a celeb and it's better than Kirstie's on that pioneer pay channel or Lisa K's on the other big pay channel.This show was actually funny which is rare for a sitcom these days and it had a female lead; another rarity in this new century.I loved the running gags like the gates to Aaron's Mansion playing the Charlie's Angel's theme or never seeing Aaron but hearing his voice ala-Charlie.Loni Anderson was the PERFECT choice for Tori's mom and some of quirks were deadly funny.  I loved the Christmas room in the mansion.Why did they make only 9 or 10 eps?  Why when I recorded an episode with title ""A"" did the ep with title ""c"" show up?  and this was during a ""marathon"".  [Not on VH1 but another channel showing it...I forget which one].  So I never saw all 9 eps on regular TV.  I think I saw 5 at most.Now I have the DVD set and I can enjoy it and share a good comedy with friends.  [and encourage them to buy their own].I never liked 90210 but Tori spelling can be funny and make fun of herself while being a good sport about it.Oh and the limo getting stuck in the drive-thru was truly funny.",5,I'm NOT a fan of 90210 and never was...,1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,1310,"['did', 'read', 'good', 'reviews', 'show', 'began', 'decided', 'program', 'TiVo', '[', 'product', 'placement-1', ']', '.I', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked', 'not', 'reality', 'show', 'based', 'being', 'celeb', 'better', 'Kirstie', 'pioneer', 'pay', 'channel', 'Lisa', 'K', 'other', 'big', 'pay', 'channel.This', 'show', 'was', 'actually', 'funny', 'rare', 'sitcom', 'days', 'had', 'female', 'lead', 'rarity', 'new', 'century.I', 'loved', 'running', 'gags', 'gates', 'Aaron', 'Mansion', 'playing', 'Charlie', 'Angel', 'theme', 'never', 'seeing', 'Aaron', 'hearing', 'voice', 'ala-Charlie.Loni', 'Anderson', 'was', 'PERFECT', 'choice', 'Tori', 'mom', 'quirks', 'were', 'deadly', 'funny', 'loved', 'Christmas', 'room', 'mansion.Why', 'did', 'make', 'only', '9', '10', 'eps', 'Why', 'when', 'recorded', 'episode', 'title', 'did', 'ep', 'title', 'c', 'show', 'up', 'was', 'marathon', '[', 'Not', 'VH1', 'channel', 'showing', 'forget', 'one', ']', 'never', 'saw', '9', 'eps', 'regular', 'TV', 'think', 'saw', '5', 'most.Now', 'have', 'DVD', 'set', 'can', 'enjoy', 'share', 'good', 'comedy', 'friends', '[', 'encourage', 'buy', 'own', ']', '.I', 'never', 'liked', '90210', 'Tori', 'spelling', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'make', 'fun', 'being', 'good', 'sport', 'it.Oh', 'limo', 'getting', 'stuck', 'drive-thru', 'was', 'truly', 'funny']",N/A
