742304,A1E4QQDW94YBHH,B00008H2G4,Aileen P. Grospe,"[0, 0]","I just loved the plot of this anime: an orphaned girl who works part-time to make her way through school befriends a family with a secret to hide and thus her adventure of a lifetime begins! I would say this anime attempts to answer the question: How far are you willing to risk for a friend (loved one)? Hmmm, should I rephrase that? ARE YOU WILLING TO RISK EVERYTHING FOR THE ONE YOU LOVE?? This is what Tohru will attempt to answer as she ventures into her relationship with the Sohmas: Yuki, Kyo, and the rest of the family that hide a curse that burdens each of them. Although the anime's story revolves around the trio of Yuki, Kyo, and Tohru, there are side stories for the other members of the Sohmas that are cursed. I loved that they include these characters and how Tohru interacts with each of them and eventually, unexpectedly on her part, she is able to reach into their hearts and assist them in coping with this curse that they bear. Unbeknown to them she becomes their sounding board and their light in their darkness especially to Kyo who bears the darkest secret of all. But it's not all about Tohru, it's also about how this family copes with each other as well. I would not recommend this DVD to those under 16 years of age due to the allusions of homosexuality.",5,An endearing anime,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,1283,"['just', 'loved', 'plot', 'anime', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'who', 'part-time', 'make', 'way', 'school', 'befriends', 'family', 'secret', 'hide', 'thus', 'adventure', 'lifetime', 'would', 'say', 'anime', 'answer', 'question', 'How', 'far', 'are', 'willing', 'risk', 'friend', 'loved', 'one', 'Hmmm', 'should', 'rephrase', 'ARE', 'YOU', 'WILLING', 'TO', 'RISK', 'EVERYTHING', 'THE', 'ONE', 'YOU', 'LOVE', 'what', 'Tohru', 'will', 'attempt', 'answer', 'ventures', 'relationship', 'Sohmas', 'Yuki', 'Kyo', 'rest', 'family', 'curse', 'anime', 'story', 'trio', 'Yuki', 'Kyo', 'Tohru', 'are', 'side', 'stories', 'other', 'members', 'Sohmas', 'are', 'cursed', 'loved', 'include', 'characters', 'how', 'Tohru', 'eventually', 'unexpectedly', 'part', 'able', 'reach', 'hearts', 'assist', 'coping', 'curse', 'bear', 'Unbeknown', 'sounding', 'board', 'light', 'darkness', 'especially', 'Kyo', 'who', 'darkest', 'secret', 'not', 'Tohru', 'also', 'about', 'how', 'family', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'DVD', '16', 'years', 'age', 'due', 'allusions', 'homosexuality']",Fruits Basket - Volume 4: The Clearing Sky
742305,A398SM0LR6KLZO,B00008H2G4,Aion,"[3, 3]","On the face of it, I should hate Fruits Basket (FB).-- An overly nice girl, surrounded by beautiful (and sometimes sexually confused) men.-- Cute animal transformations.-- A predictable (in fiction, the maternal instinct activators always win) cliche uncontrollable bad boy (Kyo) + boring but intelligent and princely pretty boy (Yuki) love triangle, with the nice girl at the center.But I couldn't hate FB. I loved it. When you list the elements that make FB tick, glossing over the positives, then it reads like something aimed squarely at those without penises. However, in reality it's one of the rare 'genderless' shoujo in terms of both genders being able to derive pleasure from watching it.FB's heroine, Tohru, could very well be described as kind to the point of fakeness, but that's not how she came across to me. She'd been raised with loving care and taught numerous life lessons by her mother, and that enabled her to show a natural, always giving loving side to those around her. The entire cast of characters fall for and/or like her not because she's kind but because there's no hidden agenda behind her actions. And, occasionally, along with being genuinely sweet, she'd come out with an intelligent insight or two, using an analogy - such as the time she told Kyo he was like a rice ball that didn't realize he had a plum stuck to his back in an attempt to get him to understand that he's unable to see his good points.Tohru's character alone makes what would be an otherwise uninspiring love triangle worth investing in, emotionally. She stands in the middle of two rivals who hate each other with passion, and she unites them through the love they both hold for her. Because of her, friendship may blossom, but it's also true that their feelings for her may very well push their heated rivalry over the edge - that's why it's so compelling to watch how the trio's relationship develops.Putting Tohru aside, I did start to tire of the episodic silliness, towards the end. The series reached a point, around halfway through, where the love triangle wasn't advancing at all and nothing new regarding the curse was being revealed. Instead, every episode covered a new but largely pointless character, or brought other already introduced characters back into the fray. It was entertaining, most certainly, but it was reaching the point of becoming old and stale....And that's why the final three episodes shocked me so much. I expected a rushed 'original story' finale. Instead, the direction of the show changed completely - the comedy being removed - and, out of nowhere, some seriously hard-hitting drama replaced it.Kyo's past and the dark secret he has to live with transformed him into a character with true depth - no longer was he a mere clone of every other bad-tempered, simple-minded, aggressive third point of a love triangle. His issues with his mother being afraid of him and not being honest are deep-rooted, and his happiness over Tohru admitting to being scared of him spoke volumes about the writing, as well as further highlighting why Tohru is so lovable.You see, if Tohru truly was 100% perfect and the type of character that can only exist in the imagination of men, she'd have run right after Kyo after seeing the real him and not once hesitated. But she didn't. Instead, she was sick as she pursued and thought about him, and she couldn't help but admit to her fear. Her actions made me view her as a very human character, and Kyo's... problem means the story is probably going to go in an almost Beauty and the Beast direction. My only disappointment right now is that the anime is incomplete, requiring much manga reading for me to see the story through to its conclusion...In closing, I'm happy I wasn't so foolish as to assume the worst before giving FB my time. Unsurprisingly, considering they share the same director, FB and Kodocha's humour is very similar, and I'm fond of stories that keep me laughing, even when dealing with difficult subjects that would weigh down other stories in doom and gloom.If, like me, you have too many chest hairs to count, fret not: FB will not turn you gay. Every girly-seeming anime box set needs a 'SAFE FOR MANLY MEN!' sticker stuck on, and FB is the first I'd attach such a sticker to.",4,Cute Animal Transformations: Manliness Irrelevant,1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,4268,"['face', 'should', 'hate', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'FB', 'overly', 'nice', 'girl', 'surrounded', 'beautiful', 'sometimes', 'sexually', 'confused', 'men.', 'Cute', 'animal', 'transformations.', 'predictable', 'fiction', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'activators', 'always', 'win', 'cliche', 'uncontrollable', 'bad', 'boy', 'Kyo', '+', 'boring', 'intelligent', 'princely', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Yuki', 'love', 'triangle', 'nice', 'girl', 'center.But', 'could', ""n't"", 'hate', 'FB', 'loved', 'When', 'list', 'elements', 'make', 'FB', 'tick', 'glossing', 'positives', 'then', 'something', 'aimed', 'squarely', 'penises', 'However', 'reality', 'one', 'rare', ""'genderless"", 'shoujo', 'terms', 'genders', 'being', 'able', 'derive', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'it.FB', 'heroine', 'Tohru', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'described', 'kind', 'point', 'fakeness', 'not', 'how', 'came', ""'d"", 'been', 'raised', 'loving', 'care', 'taught', 'numerous', 'life', 'lessons', 'mother', 'enabled', 'show', 'natural', 'always', 'giving', 'loving', 'side', 'entire', 'cast', 'characters', 'fall', 'and/or', 'not', 'kind', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'actions', 'occasionally', 'being', 'genuinely', 'sweet', ""'d"", 'come', 'out', 'intelligent', 'insight', 'two', 'using', 'analogy', 'such', 'time', 'told', 'Kyo', 'was', 'rice', 'ball', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'had', 'plum', 'stuck', 'back', 'attempt', 'get', 'understand', 'unable', 'see', 'good', 'points.Tohru', 'character', 'alone', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'otherwise', 'uninspiring', 'love', 'triangle', 'investing', 'emotionally', 'middle', 'two', 'rivals', 'who', 'hate', 'other', 'passion', 'love', 'hold', 'friendship', 'may', 'blossom', 'also', 'true', 'feelings', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'push', 'heated', 'rivalry', 'edge', 'why', 'so', 'compelling', 'watch', 'how', 'trio', 'relationship', 'develops.Putting', 'Tohru', 'aside', 'did', 'start', 'tire', 'episodic', 'silliness', 'end', 'series', 'reached', 'point', 'halfway', 'where', 'love', 'triangle', 'was', ""n't"", 'advancing', 'nothing', 'new', 'regarding', 'curse', 'was', 'being', 'revealed', 'Instead', 'episode', 'covered', 'new', 'largely', 'pointless', 'character', 'brought', 'other', 'already', 'introduced', 'characters', 'back', 'fray', 'was', 'entertaining', 'most', 'certainly', 'was', 'reaching', 'point', 'becoming', 'old', 'stale', 'why', 'final', 'three', 'episodes', 'shocked', 'so', 'much', 'expected', 'rushed', ""'original"", 'story', 'finale', 'Instead', 'direction', 'show', 'changed', 'completely', 'comedy', 'being', 'removed', 'nowhere', 'seriously', 'hard-hitting', 'drama', 'replaced', 'it.Kyo', 'past', 'dark', 'secret', 'live', 'transformed', 'character', 'true', 'depth', 'no', 'longer', 'was', 'mere', 'clone', 'other', 'bad-tempered', 'simple-minded', 'aggressive', 'third', 'point', 'love', 'triangle', 'issues', 'mother', 'being', 'afraid', 'not', 'being', 'honest', 'are', 'deep-rooted', 'happiness', 'Tohru', 'admitting', 'being', 'scared', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'writing', 'as', 'well', 'further', 'highlighting', 'why', 'Tohru', 'so', 'lovable.You', 'see', 'Tohru', 'truly', 'was', '100', '%', 'perfect', 'type', 'character', 'can', 'only', 'exist', 'imagination', 'men', ""'d"", 'have', 'run', 'right', 'Kyo', 'seeing', 'real', 'not', 'once', 'hesitated', 'did', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'was', 'sick', 'pursued', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'admit', 'fear', 'actions', 'made', 'view', 'very', 'human', 'character', 'Kyo', 'problem', 'story', 'probably', 'going', 'go', 'almost', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'direction', 'only', 'disappointment', 'right', 'now', 'anime', 'incomplete', 'requiring', 'much', 'manga', 'reading', 'see', 'story', 'conclusion', 'closing', ""'m"", 'happy', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'foolish', 'assume', 'worst', 'giving', 'FB', 'time', 'Unsurprisingly', 'considering', 'share', 'same', 'director', 'FB', 'Kodocha', 'humour', 'very', 'similar', ""'m"", 'fond', 'stories', 'keep', 'laughing', 'even', 'when', 'dealing', 'difficult', 'subjects', 'would', 'weigh', 'down', 'other', 'stories', 'doom', 'gloom.If', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'chest', 'hairs', 'count', 'fret', 'not', 'FB', 'will', 'not', 'turn', 'gay', 'girly-seeming', 'anime', 'box', 'set', ""'SAFE"", 'MANLY', 'MEN', 'sticker', 'stuck', 'FB', 'first', ""'d"", 'attach', 'such', 'sticker']",Fruits Basket - Volume 4: The Clearing Sky
742306,A2ZS8TWUL1QTRH,B00008H2G4,A.J. Dill,"[13, 66]","I was very excited when I finally received this series since it wasn't the traditional samurai warrior or giant robot Sci Fi I have seen so many times before. It was going to be a breath of fresh air, or so I thought. The first few episodes were great, very mysterious. But as I reached the half way point, things got dry, really dry.The shows became very predictable- a little bad thing would happen and Tohru saves the day. I felt like I was back in psychology class again with all the narriating of Tohru's thoughts. After awhile, the main character began to get on my nerves with her lack of personality. She was always happy happy joy joy. There were also cross-dressing men which can be fun, but there are so many in this show, they became annoying too.What was the biggest disappointment, though, was the lack of the director's creativity with the Sohma's curse. I thought there would be a huge crazy spiel with the Sohma's changing into their zodiac animals all over the place in public. I also thought they would take advantage of their ability to change into an animal more often. At the beginning, it looked like the Sohma's could communicate or control their zodiac animals, but it turns out the animals just follow them. Even that aspect wasn't even taken well advantage of in the show! Unfortunately for me, I have some creativity, and the show did not come even close to its full potential of crazines.And the ending, don't even get me started on that.I suggest you stay away from this series if you like shows that aren't predictable. I was able to predict what would happen next just like in Pokemon.

742319,A22XHZ3MFP6MSV,B00008H2G4,Cranky Reviewer,"[40, 40]","The final disc of Fruits Basket starts out with a few stories almost unconnected to the main plot.  Yuki decides to try to get to know his brother better and makes a surreal visit to Ayame's store...Tohru meets Hiro Sohma, Kisa's ill-tempered little friend....we get to have a peek into the head of Yuki's fanclub president, a reminder of teenage passion which is as touching as it is funny and psychotic....and we briefly meet Ritsu Sohma, who definitely takes getting used to.  The final three episodes are grim, dark, suspenseful and emotionally powerful, as once again, Tohru must confront the fact that parts of the Sohma curse--and family--are not at all adorable.  And this time, rising to the occasion to offer comfort and encouragement might even be beyond the abilities of Tohru.  Kyo's horrific darkest secret is revealed, and Akito finally finishes playing with Tohru, and makes his move to destroy her spirit utterly, and plunge his family back into the condition of unresisting despair which is their true curse.People who love this series should be aware that, although it feels complete and resolved, the anime only covers the first 6 books of a manga series which is just about to be released in English.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Let's get this out of the way: the anime of Natsuki Takaya's ""Fruits Basket"" doesn't so much end as stop.But that doesn't stop ""Fruits Basket, Volume 4: The Clearing Sky"" from being a truly, wrenchingly beautiful end to an adorable series. New zodiac members are introduced to Tohru and more madcap comedy ensues (courtesy of Ayame and the demented fanclub), but it reaches new heights in the final two episodes -- where Tohru's love and kindess are faced with new obstacles.Yuki and Tohru make a weekend trip to Ayame's special clothing shop, and are promptly swept up into Hurricane Ayame, who is all too happy to regale Yuki with every detail of his oddball business. Can the brothers manage to bridge the gap that separates them -- and what exactly is ""The Thing"" that Ayame's girlfriend is dressing Tohru in?And Tohru is confronted by a pair of new zodiac members. First she encounters Hiro, the antisocial ""sheep"" who resents her friendship with Kisa. Then she meets the beautiful, hyperapologetic daughter of the hot spring lady, Ritsu... only to discover that Ritsu is actually a very effeminate young man, who suffers from self-esteem so low that it dips below Atlantis.And since Ritsu drives Kyo and Yuki crazy with his screaming apologies (and is teased constantly by Shigure), it's up to Tohru to help him regain some hope. Finally, the president of Yuki's fanclub is haunted by her impending graduation, only to find herself in conversation with the ""prince"" himself. Unfortunately, her jealousy wells up in front of him -- and she has to face the ugly truth about her own feelings.But the story takes a truly dark turn when Kyo's beloved master Kazuma arrives at Shigure's house, and reveals a horrifying facet of Kyo's curse -- a ghastly transformation that horrifies anyone who sees it. And as she struggles to help Kyo, Tohru begins to learn the reason for Akito's anger and hatred.""Fruits Basket, Volume 4: The Clearing Sky"" doesn't end the series so much as hit pause -- the curse remains unbroken and the love triangle is still unresolved. As a sort of series climax, the writers even scripted in a harrowing encounter between Tohru and Akito, which gives the series the vague feeling of having been finished.Before that end, we get ""Fruits Basket's"" signature mingling of heartwarming comedy and bittersweet drama. There are plenty of roiling emotions -- jealousy, loneliness, self-loathing -- but with the realization that there's always a glimmer of hope. The wrenching emotions reach a climax in the final two episodes, when the reasons for Kyo's loneliness are revealed, as well as Kagura's mad crush on him. Horror, romance and drama just soak every scene.And we still get plenty of comedy, ranging from spoofs (Motoko's high-school drama) to hilarious sight gags (Ritsu rampaging with shrieks of ""I'm sorry!""). Ayame provides most of the humor -- when he's not being sweet and vulnerable, he's rushing around in bridal drag and chitchatting about fashion with his girlfriend. Not to mention the ""rice ball alien in a sailor suit!"" that pops up randomly.Tohru continues to be a shining beacon at the series' heart -- she's sweet, kind, accepting, and cannot help but try to be kind to anyone, even when Hiro steals her purse and insults her. On the flipside, Kyo's feelings of loneliness and misery are absolutely palpable near the end -- and considering what he turns into, it's not hard to see why.In fact, all the characters we see are pretty lovable -- Yuki is quiet, cool and a lot tougher than he appears, while Ayame and his girlfriend are insane and quirky, Kisa and Ritsu are adorable, and Shigure is winningly sadistic. Even the deranged hot springs lady appears (""I'm SORRY! I'll do it again! I never should have put myself into the reel! What was I thinking?! I'm SORRY!"" ""I told him we shouldn't have asked her to come..."").The fourth and final volume of the beautiful, hilarious ""Fruits Basket"" series sadly wasn't able to finish the storyline -- but it's still a brilliant finale.",5,A riceball and a fruits basket,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,4021,"['Let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'anime', 'Natsuki', 'Takaya', 'Fruits', 'Basket', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'end', 'stop.But', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'Volume', '4', 'Clearing', 'Sky', 'being', 'truly', 'wrenchingly', 'beautiful', 'end', 'adorable', 'series', 'New', 'zodiac', 'members', 'are', 'introduced', 'Tohru', 'more', 'madcap', 'comedy', 'ensues', 'courtesy', 'Ayame', 'demented', 'fanclub', 'new', 'heights', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'where', 'Tohru', 'love', 'kindess', 'are', 'faced', 'new', 'obstacles.Yuki', 'Tohru', 'make', 'weekend', 'trip', 'Ayame', 'special', 'clothing', 'shop', 'are', 'promptly', 'swept', 'up', 'Hurricane', 'Ayame', 'who', 'too', 'happy', 'regale', 'Yuki', 'detail', 'oddball', 'business', 'Can', 'brothers', 'manage', 'bridge', 'gap', 'what', 'exactly', 'Thing', 'Ayame', 'girlfriend', 'dressing', 'Tohru', 'Tohru', 'confronted', 'pair', 'new', 'zodiac', 'members', 'First', 'Hiro', 'antisocial', 'sheep', 'who', 'friendship', 'Kisa', 'Then', 'beautiful', 'hyperapologetic', 'daughter', 'hot', 'spring', 'lady', 'Ritsu', 'only', 'discover', 'Ritsu', 'actually', 'very', 'effeminate', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'self-esteem', 'so', 'low', 'Atlantis.And', 'Ritsu', 'Kyo', 'Yuki', 'crazy', 'screaming', 'apologies', 'teased', 'constantly', 'Shigure', 'up', 'Tohru', 'help', 'regain', 'hope', 'Finally', 'president', 'Yuki', 'fanclub', 'haunted', 'impending', 'graduation', 'only', 'find', 'conversation', 'prince', 'Unfortunately', 'jealousy', 'up', 'front', 'face', 'ugly', 'truth', 'own', 'feelings.But', 'story', 'truly', 'dark', 'turn', 'when', 'Kyo', 'beloved', 'master', 'Kazuma', 'Shigure', 'house', 'horrifying', 'facet', 'Kyo', 'curse', 'ghastly', 'transformation', 'anyone', 'who', 'help', 'Kyo', 'Tohru', 'learn', 'reason', 'Akito', 'anger', 'hatred', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'Volume', '4', 'Clearing', 'Sky', ""n't"", 'end', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'hit', 'pause', 'curse', 'unbroken', 'love', 'triangle', 'still', 'unresolved', 'sort', 'series', 'climax', 'writers', 'even', 'scripted', 'harrowing', 'encounter', 'Tohru', 'Akito', 'series', 'vague', 'feeling', 'having', 'been', 'finished.Before', 'end', 'get', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'signature', 'mingling', 'heartwarming', 'comedy', 'bittersweet', 'drama', 'are', 'plenty', 'roiling', 'emotions', 'jealousy', 'loneliness', 'self-loathing', 'realization', 'always', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'wrenching', 'emotions', 'reach', 'climax', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'when', 'reasons', 'Kyo', 'loneliness', 'are', 'revealed', 'as', 'well', 'Kagura', 'mad', 'crush', 'Horror', 'romance', 'drama', 'just', 'soak', 'scene.And', 'still', 'get', 'plenty', 'comedy', 'ranging', 'spoofs', 'Motoko', 'high-school', 'drama', 'hilarious', 'sight', 'gags', 'Ritsu', 'rampaging', 'shrieks', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Ayame', 'most', 'humor', 'when', 'not', 'being', 'sweet', 'vulnerable', 'rushing', 'around', 'bridal', 'drag', 'chitchatting', 'fashion', 'girlfriend', 'Not', 'mention', 'rice', 'alien', 'sailor', 'suit', 'up', 'randomly.Tohru', 'be', 'shining', 'beacon', 'series', 'heart', 'sweet', 'kind', 'accepting', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'try', 'be', 'kind', 'anyone', 'even', 'when', 'Hiro', 'purse', 'insults', 'flipside', 'Kyo', 'feelings', 'loneliness', 'misery', 'are', 'absolutely', 'palpable', 'end', 'considering', 'what', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why.In', 'fact', 'characters', 'see', 'are', 'pretty', 'lovable', 'Yuki', 'quiet', 'cool', 'lot', 'tougher', 'Ayame', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'insane', 'quirky', 'Kisa', 'Ritsu', 'are', 'adorable', 'Shigure', 'winningly', 'sadistic', 'Even', 'deranged', 'hot', 'springs', 'lady', ""'m"", 'SORRY', ""'ll"", 'do', 'again', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'put', 'reel', 'What', 'was', 'thinking', ""'m"", 'SORRY', 'told', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'asked', 'come', '.The', 'fourth', 'final', 'volume', 'beautiful', 'hilarious', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'series', 'sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'finish', 'storyline', 'still', 'brilliant', 'finale']",Fruits Basket - Volume 4: The Clearing Sky

742327,A2KSRJFZ2R9JK3,B00008H2G4,Fuwwyfootpaws,"[1, 1]","Fruits Basket is a sweet and wonderful anime. It is based on the manga series by Natsuki Takaya.The show is about a girl named Tohru who goes to live with the Sohma family. She learns about the fact that the family are possessed by the spirits of the Chinese Zodiac. She learns that each family member turns into their zodiac animal if they are hugged by someone of the opposite sex, or if they are under great stress. But Tohru's presence becomes a positive influence on the family.Some of my favorite characters in this show are:Tohru: She is one of the sweetest anime characters I can think of. She will do anything for anyone and she loves to make people happy. She is sweet, optimistic, and understanding. Tohru is a wonderful character.Kyo: He is a cat and he becomes best friends with Tohru, but in the anime, it is hard to tell who likes Tohru better, him or Yuki. Kyo had a rough childhood, and he was rejected by many people until he met his trainer who took him in and taught him martial arts. Kyo's hard childhood made him short-tempered. He gets angry easily and he can be a bully. A lot of people don't like him and are afraid of him because of his intimidating personality. He sometimes bullies his cousin Momiji whenever he makes silly comments about him and Tohru, but it's always done in a funny and goofy way. He can also be really shy, and he goes through a lot in the show. He is the character in this show who is often under the most stress.Yuki: He is a rat and he likes Tohru. He is the pretty boy of the school and everyone finds him attractive, but he has low self esteem because of what he went through as a child. He and Kyo despise each other because of their signs.Shigure: He is a dog and a goofy person, He is also a novelist, and he often puts his editor through a lot of stress by ignoring his deadlines for his novels.Momiji: He is an adorable and sweet boy the same age as Hatsuharu. He is a rabbit, and he always dresses in girl's clothes. He becomes close with Tohru, even asking her if she wants to be his friend the first time they meet. He is smart and he tries to cheer people up similar to Tohru. He sometimes cracks jokes about Kyo and Tohru, which makes Kyo angry and causes Momiji to get bullied by him.This is a really sweet show with wonderful morals. Tohru is so sweet and optimistic, and she does anything to make people happy. There are a lot of characters and we learn a lot about every character. It also has a lot of emotional scenes and the last 2 episodes are really dramatic. The show has a wonderful happy ending where Tohru brings out the real emotions of the villain. We learn about what the villain went through as a child that caused him to be so cruel and mean. But the show is not entirely about the villain, who we don't see much of anyway. The show is about friendship and understanding. It also has morals about family problems, bullying, and sexual preferences.

We watched a few episodes together and I can actually tell that it's remastered, as I own the older version. The story is very sweet and cute, good for people of all ages and can be a ""family anime"" although the last 3 to 4 eps you should watch beforehand because there are parts where a small child might get scared. I definitely love the detail, as well as the extras. This does follow a different storyline from the manga though, and there are certain details that are incorrect when compared to the manga. For this set itself, and for a show you can watch together with family members and younger siblings, I feel that this is a good buy. I will point out that amazon has periodic sales on anime, and I only paid $30, and I would not pay $60 for this product. Personally I feel that's too steep of a price for a show with one season, and I tend to try and get deals on anime since I buy so much of it. All of the dvds in the set came intact and were still in place when the set was opened. For the price I paid the packaging is high quality, with individual dvd sets housed within the larger box sleeve. Each set has artwork on it, which my friend seemed to enjoy just looking at. And unlike some past collections, this also has some special features on it as well. Definitely worth the price, and if the price goes back up, I think it's worth waiting for the price to fall again, rather then buying the viridian collection (worse packaging, less features, not remastered).",5,"Well done, well re-done actually",1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,1571,"['new', 'remastered', 'version', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'bought', 'friend', 'mine', 'watched', 'few', 'episodes', 'together', 'can', 'actually', 'tell', 'remastered', 'own', 'older', 'version', 'story', 'very', 'sweet', 'cute', 'good', 'people', 'ages', 'can', 'be', 'family', 'anime', 'last', '3', '4', 'eps', 'should', 'watch', 'beforehand', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'small', 'child', 'might', 'get', 'scared', 'definitely', 'love', 'detail', 'as', 'well', 'extras', 'follow', 'different', 'storyline', 'manga', 'are', 'certain', 'details', 'are', 'incorrect', 'when', 'compared', 'manga', 'set', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'together', 'family', 'members', 'younger', 'siblings', 'feel', 'good', 'buy', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'amazon', 'periodic', 'sales', 'anime', 'only', 'paid', '30', 'would', 'not', 'pay', '60', 'product', 'Personally', 'feel', 'too', 'steep', 'price', 'show', 'one', 'season', 'tend', 'try', 'get', 'deals', 'anime', 'buy', 'so', 'much', 'dvds', 'set', 'came', 'intact', 'were', 'still', 'place', 'when', 'set', 'was', 'opened', 'price', 'paid', 'packaging', 'high', 'quality', 'individual', 'dvd', 'sets', 'housed', 'larger', 'box', 'sleeve', 'set', 'artwork', 'friend', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'just', 'looking', 'past', 'collections', 'also', 'special', 'features', 'as', 'well', 'Definitely', 'price', 'price', 'back', 'think', 'worth', 'waiting', 'price', 'fall', 'again', 'rather', 'then', 'buying', 'viridian', 'collection', 'worse', 'packaging', 'less', 'features', 'not', 'remastered']",Fruits Basket - Volume 4: The Clearing Sky

""Fantasy and Romance Author""","[12, 12]","If you can get past the weird name of this series (refers to a Japanese kid's game similar to duck-duck-goose) and the girly-girly packaging, it's a surprisingly deep and poignant character study.The premise: an orphaned & homeless high-school girl is taken in as a housekeeper by one of her classmates, a very shy but very popular boy named Yuki. He's living with his novelist-cousin Shigure in a rather isolated house in the woods, having run away from the main Sohma compound. But the guys have a big secret--they're shapeshifters, two members of a cursed family.Our heroine soon makes a place in their hearts with her relentless optimism and unconditional love & gratitude, and soon other disaffected members of the cursed family start to gather at Shigure's house. Chief among the arrivals is a violent-tempered but good-hearted young man known as Kyo, who bears the most difficult curse of all, and who's an outcast even within the Sohma family.The head of the family, cursed himself, is intensely and malevolently possessive of ""his"" family, and he starts to plot his revenge...but at the same time, he hopes Tohru can save the family from the worst effects of the curse.Very interesting mixture of genuine pathos and wild slapstick, and a great job portraying the gradual change in characters of not only the two boys, Yuki and Kyo, over a period of 18 months, but also the maturation of the heroine, as she develops  courage and strength to match her innate compassion. She goes from being essentially a sweetly-smiling doormat to someone brave enough to stand up for herself and the people she loves--without getting mean about it.I have to admit I started watching this series with some skepticism, thinking it'd be hopelessly silly, but ended up loving it.

742338,AWK4E3IB6SWEE,B00008H2G4,"Karusichan ""Karusichan""","[5, 5]","The last disc of the first season of Fruits Basket starts off with a visit to Ayami's shop by Yuki and Tohru. Little does Yuki know that when Ayami says he sells ""Male romantic Fantasies"" what he means is that he sells ladies lingerie he designs and hand makes himself. This throws Yuki off, but he decides to try to continue bonding with his older brother anyways, and while he's at it he gets the added bonus of seeing Tohru sample some of Ayami's handiwork.Another member of the zodiac crosses paths with Tohru; this time it's Hiro Sohma, born the year of the ram. Hiro is roughly Kisa Sohma's age, and it is because of Kisa that he decides to approach Tohru, a woman he finds obnoxious. But he must do it, especially if it is for Kisa. After that yet another member shows up, this time it's Ritsu Sohma, the monkey, a man who is not what he seems at first glance, and has severe anxiety problems.The height of this disc comes in the last three episodes, all more or less a continuation of each other up into the climax of the series. When Kyo's master shows up the house goes into an uproar. Apparently along with training Kyo, Kagura, and Yuki, Master Kazuma acted as a surrogate father to Kyo, raising him in his own home since he was a young child after the unfortunate death of his Mother. At first Kyo is reluctant to show his happiness at Kazuma's arrival in front of Yuki, but he is nothing short of ecstatic to have his former master about, and he begs him to remove him from that house. Kazuma decides to push Kyo further and forcibly convinces him to reveal his true self to Tohru. This requires that Kyo remove his beaded bracelet, then his original self emerges in all of it's horrifying glory...What will Tohru say when she sees him like this? How will she react? Will he lose her if she sees him as he truly is?I can't give everything away, nor would I want to. The climax to this series is so moving, I was crying by the end of this three part episode. There were parts that were altered from the manga...or at the very least switched about, I have not read the last four volumes of the manga yet so it is hard for me to say how accurate it is, but there are many tender moments that have been added to create more character depth and dynamics in the plot. Yuki and Kyo have a bonding moment in the end of the ""Revelation of Kyo's true self"" episode, and it's almost obvious where the two of them stand with Tohru as far as romantic love goes. Even Shigure, who is normally there for comic relief, has a few serious moments that turn out to be nothing short of heartwarming. Arisa and Hana show up as well, to show just how much they care about Tohru. Even Akito turns up in the ending of the series, and there are some nail biting screen moments between him and Tohru, but they are resolved well enough to lead into a second season....if there will ever be one.I guess that could be my only real complaint about the way this series turned out... that the rest of it has not been animated yet. Personally, I can't wait to see where the members of the zodiac go from here. Everything was left at such a cliff hanger as far as character development goes that it would be an utter shame if the studio that produced it failed to get another season off the ground.  Do I have any predictions for the future? Of course I do, but mine come from the knowledge I have gleaned from reading further into the manga series than has been animated up until this point, so I am going to keep those thoughts to myself, for the moment. All I can say is...wow... I hope more gets made soon... I'm going to go into withdrawal until it does.",5,Curses...

742339,A2R4HK5ZJKL0UH,B00008H2G4,"Katie ""Dark Musashi""","[5, 7]","Yes, I am one of those people that saw this series before reading any of the manga. My opinion about manga used to be that it was too expensive to collect entire series and I would rather just watch the anime. However, I eventually realized that some manga does a much better job of telling a story than the corresponding anime does - this series is one such example.All things considered, the Fruits Basket box set is value priced. When this series first came out the DVDs with just a few episodes on each were around $40, but getting the whole box set of 26 episodes is a much better deal.I think there are enough reviews to tell you what the story is, so I'll just tell you what I think about it.THE GOOD:* The story is pretty original.* It is full of likeable (and even loveable) characters. I like Momiji ^_^* The psycho ""Prince Yuki Fan Club"" was pretty funny, and it's one of the few things I believe was actually done better in the anime version.* It's a good show to watch if you just want something entertaining that you don't have to think about too much. It's undeniably adorable.THE BAD:* They constantly show flashbacks of things that happened or things people said like 2 seconds ago. It almost insults watchers' intelligence sometimes because you already know the point they're driving at. I mean, come on, we don't need a recap of something that JUST HAPPENED.* I agree with some other reviewers who said that Tohru's character is not ever really developed. She starts out the same way she ends up.* The ending was waaaaaaay too soon, and I found it extremely unfulfilling. It doesn't go all the way up to where the manga ends (heck, at the time this review is being written the manga isn't even all out yet.) So you don't really get to see the actual ending, it only goes partway.* Some of the episodes in the middle are repetitive and tend to drag a bit. Formula: A new person appears, they don't like the idea of Tohru, then they meet her and end up liking her like everyone else. Yuki and Kyo fight and someone transforms at some point. The end.Again, I really encourage everyone to read the manga for this series. There are so many important plotlines that aren't even mentioned, or are merely hinted at in the anime. There are so many more things explained, and it is given a lot more depth in the manga. It's hard to explain, but it really is very different. So watch if you like, but please, read also.",3,"Good, but read the manga!

But little did she know what she was getting herself into. When she looses her balance and grabs onto Kyo for support he turns into a cat! The Sohmas are a cursed family--when they are hugged by a member of the opposite sex they turn into their respective zodiac animals.What is so good about Fruits Basket? One we can relate to a lot of the events in the show. Though we may not have just had our mother die like Tohru did, we all go through hardship. However Tohru can be seen as such a wonderful role model. Though she has hardship she always looks to the bright side of things, never being gloomy. She is the most unselfish person for she always worries about everyone else's problems instead of her own.Why is the anime called Fruits Basket? Well you'll just have to watch and see for the reason behind the show's title is reveled in episode 5 when we learn more about Tohru's past and character.Fruits Basket is an anime I would reccommend to everyone even if you generally do not watch shoujo anime. It has enough humor to keep you addicted and watching (Shigure-san's sarcastic and idiotic remarks). All in all it's a great anime...so if you've never seen it I truly reccommend it. It's defiantly a winner to have in your collection.",5,a hilarious and yet heart-wrenching anime,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,1848,"['Fruits', 'Basket', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'anime', 'series', 'going', 'find', 'everything', 'anime', 'series', 'would', 'want', 'comedy', 'humor', 'romance', 'even', 'action', 'consider', 'bickering', 'Kyo', 'Yuki', 'action.Fruits', 'Basket', 'Honda', 'Tohru', '16', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'who', 'tent', 'mother', 'had', 'just', 'passed', 'away', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'burden', 'anyone', 'having', 'take', 'care', 'Going', 'school', 'one', 'day', 'house', 'classmate', 'Sohma', 'Yuki', 'When', 'Sohmas', 'discover', 'tent', 'invite', 'live', 'exchange', 'housekeeping', 'chores', 'little', 'did', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'When', 'balance', 'grabs', 'Kyo', 'support', 'cat', 'Sohmas', 'are', 'cursed', 'family', 'when', 'are', 'hugged', 'member', 'opposite', 'sex', 'turn', 'respective', 'zodiac', 'animals.What', 'so', 'good', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'One', 'can', 'relate', 'lot', 'events', 'show', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'just', 'had', 'mother', 'die', 'Tohru', 'did', 'go', 'hardship', 'However', 'Tohru', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'such', 'wonderful', 'role', 'model', 'hardship', 'always', 'bright', 'side', 'things', 'never', 'being', 'gloomy', 'most', 'unselfish', 'person', 'always', 'everyone', 'else', 'problems', 'instead', 'own.Why', 'anime', 'called', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'reason', 'show', 'title', 'reveled', 'episode', '5', 'when', 'learn', 'more', 'Tohru', 'past', 'character.Fruits', 'Basket', 'anime', 'would', 'reccommend', 'everyone', 'even', 'generally', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'shoujo', 'anime', 'enough', 'humor', 'keep', 'addicted', 'watching', 'Shigure-san', 'sarcastic', 'idiotic', 'remarks', 'great', 'anime', 'so', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'truly', 'reccommend', 'defiantly', 'winner', 'have', 'collection']",Fruits Basket - Volume 4: The Clearing Sky

Now if you have rea the manga you prob will be disappointed bc there's only one season and it let's off like on the 6 manga. If you dont know what fruits basket is about it's about the sohma family who live with a curse when they get hugged by the opposite sex they turn into one of the zodak signs. A romance kinda stars between tohru and kyo and yuki. Pulling the love triangle but it's actually sweet tohru contacts with everyone in the sohma family.

They have the zodiac curse upon them making certain members of the family transform into the animals of the zodiac (including the cat) when they are embraced by a member of the opposite sex or when they are under a great deal of stress.  The three main zodiac members in the series are Shigure, a writer and the zodiac dog; Yuki, the rat; and Kyo, the cat who has a curse worse than anyone can imagine.

742353,A2551AOGTAT81S,B00008H2G4,Mike J.,"[3, 8]","I first noticed Fruits Basket was when I was browsing through the Amazon product selection and this anime's unusual high rating caught my attentions immediately. So I quickly watched a few episodes (1- 10) online and I was totally hooked by it. Then I stopped and hit the purchase button right away to order a copy without finishing the rest of the episodes. When it arrived, I quickly put it on my DVD player to finish the rest of the show, but it turned out, as you can tell from my rating, it left me totally disapponted.To be fair, this anime is without a doubt one of the sweestest and most touching anime I've ever seen in a long time.  As the title suggests, the main character, Tohru is described as a basket, and the fruits represent the variable characters with the curse of Chinese Zodiac animals, but Tohru holds them or unifies them together like a fruits basket despite of their inner differences. Therefore, the message behind this anime is very positive. It's about being youself, to learn to accept each other's uniqueness and differences. At least that's how I see it. Although the show has such a sweet and warm concept, there are a number of undeniable existant flaws that unexpectedly ruin its potential. Among all the flaws, perhaps the lack of character's diversifications bother me the most.1) I can forget about the main character, Tohru's ultimate selfless, simple-minded and sacrifiable personalities, which comes off as unrealistic and annoying at times, however, it's totally irritated that certain characteristic traits of many characters are overused which comes off as less diversed and less creactive. Momiji (the rabbit), Ayame (the snake) and Ritsu (the monkey) are all described as a gayish gender-confused cross-dresser, which is totally repetitive and ridiculous. Even Yuki (the rat) appears to be very feminine. I don't understand why the creator didn't choose to follow their real personality traits in accordance with the original descriptions of the Chinese zodiac since that would make much more sense. Ritsu and Ayame perhaps deserved to be called the ""poison"" of the show. Not only they both are cross-dresser, but also their other personality traits are equally unbearable. Ayame is narcissistic and not one bit funny and the monkey Ritsu who is described as so extremely depressed and low self-esteem that you would almost wish the character to be killed off just to put him out of the misery. All these mentioned characters except Yuki and Momiji, should be more realistically written instead of being too pathetically similar and negative.2) All main characters haven't grown or developed in the end. For instance, Tohru, from start to finish, continues to be like the 'Mother Teressa'; Kyo is always hot-headed and foul-mouthed, and Yuki is still the calm, quiet stereotypical strait-A pupil at school. I don't expect their characters should be changed drastically like from a good guy to be a bad guy that type of thing, but I do hope these characters would at least learn a lesson through their adventure so that they would become a much more complete person. But this never happens here.3) The show is overly sentimental in a repetitive way, which really brings down the enjoyment of the show. Like it or not, the show does work perfectly in terms of emotional impacts and that manages to touch your heart and soul sometimes, however, soon such a magic fades away duo to the same old formula they use over and over in an attempt to touch people, which results in a cheesy kind of way. To sum it up briefly, the show can be described into one situation only: every time a new Zodiac character shows up, who might hate or feel curious about Tohru, who then manages to emotionally touch each of them by saying exactly the right thing he/she likes to hear at the right time, and then the cheesy yet heartwarming ""bababa..."" openning music played at the background, that means finally they all end up being impressed by her and love her ever since.4) Some important information should've been told in details in order to make the story more completed. For example why the Sohmas got cursed with the Chinese zodiac? Throughout all 26 episodes, we have seen enough the Sohmas' members suffering because of the family curse, which results in dyfunctional family, relationship breakups, unable to touch any unrelated person who's the opposite gender or suffering from depression or lack of self-confidence; however, we don't know why the Sohmas is the only family that got attached such a terrible curse. What exactly did their ancestors do so that they would deserve such a suffering? However, we are not given any answers, it seems to me that such a curse plotline just got totally thrown together just for the sake of making a situation. As a result, such a laziness totally brings down the show's promises.5) There's also one episode in which the Yuki fangirls following the electric girl home in the hope of finding dirts about Tohru, really bothers me. In this episode, they unusually mix the real scenes such as the Tokyo streets and subways with the animated scenes all together just like the animated series, Tooney Toons, where real people and cartoon characters make up the whole show. Personally I don't think such a mix is appropriate since it would only make the rest of the animated scenes appear even more fake!6) The story ends too soon. After the disappointing filler-like episodes 13 - 23, the conclusion epsidoes from 24 - 26 finally manages to pick up some interests for the story, but it ends, just like that. It ends so sudden that you would wish they would give you a warning first. It's like all ideas have been used up and they urgently need to wrap up the story without thinking about transitional approach. I think the reason why this happens is because the anime doesn't follow the original managa which caused such abrupt ending. If i remember rightly, there are still two more Zodiac members have yet introduced while the tale has already been arranged in a way towards the end. The last three epsides are so emotionally powerful that you would left feeling unhappy about the lack of episodes.All in all, Fruits basket is a heartwarming tale with positve message despite of these flaws. Although it's far from being one of the best shojo anime, it does satisfy those who enjoys the topics of love, frienships or life-lessons. I would definitely recommend it to anyone despite of myself feeling disappointed by it.",2,Sweetly Disappointed,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,6488,"['first', 'noticed', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'was',

It's the story of a young orphan who moves in with members of a cursed family and changes things up for them. The actual plot i don't think i have to explain because so many people have in their reviews. So i'll just give my opinion: Almost every episode was great you laughed you cried and fell in love with the characters. There were two or three episodes i didn't care for but  that is usually with every anime. I think this is such a great anime and would classify it as a personalfavorite. Some advice though: go read the manga! the manga completely finishes off the story unlike the anime which while it has a emotional ending it doesn't resolve many issues between characters.So in conclusion:Pro's:Amazing,human characters.Very emotional, inspiring moments.Comedy that feels genuine and unforced (most of the time)A exceptional soundtrack  that brings a tear to the eye.Cons:Ending feels anti climatic and abrupt.One or two episodes that felt unneeded and filler like (prince Yuki fan club episodes anyone?)",5,"The most charming and inspirational,  anime i've seen in a long time.",1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,1103,"['Fruits', 'Basket', 'many', 'considered', 'classic', 'i', 'have', 'agree', 'completely', 'story', 'young', 'orphan', 'who', 'members', 'cursed', 'family', 'changes', 'things', 'up', 'actual', 'plot', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'i', 'have', 'explain', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'reviews', 'So', 'i', ""'ll"", 'just', 'give', 'opinion', 'Almost', 'episode', 'was', 'great', 'laughed', 'cried', 'fell', 'love', 'characters', 'were', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'usually', 'anime', 'think', 'such', 'great', 'anime', 'would', 'classify', 'personalfavorite', 'advice', 'go', 'read', 'manga', 'manga', 'completely', 'story', 'anime', 'emotional', 'ending', ""n't"", 'resolve', 'many', 'issues', 'characters.So', 'conclusion', 'Pro', 'Amazing', 'human', 'characters.Very', 'emotional', 'inspiring', 'moments.Comedy', 'genuine', 'unforced', 'most', 'time', 'exceptional', 'soundtrack', 'tear', 'eye.Cons', 'Ending', 'feels', 'anti', 'climatic', 'abrupt.One', 'two', 'episodes', 'felt', 'unneeded', 'filler', 'prince', 'Yuki', 'fan', 'club', 'anyone']",Fruits Basket - Volume 4: The Clearing Sky

Honda-san fills in various emotional needs that each character lacks as the episodes progress.  She obviously brings the family closer together-the artwork is well done, and the English dubbing is decent for a change-including the music, although you can still pick up the feelings by paying attention to the subtitles with the original Nihongo voice actors.  This anime was unique to me because it really attempts to draw your emotional state into the story, and has many ""feel good"" moments.  I would have enjoyed it a little better, but the ending of the series following Honda-san's ""trial"" leaves you without really knowing the long term resolution.

Like many other reviewers have said while the overall video quality is said to be remastered you won't see to much of a difference from the earlier release set though the audio has been cleaned up a lot and does sound significantly better.  The set itself comes on four dvds that hold the entire series that are put into two thin dvd case and into a cardboard sleeve pretty much like with the earlier set,  the extras are very good you'll have a fifth dvd that holds those a pretty decent selection of bonus features also you'll get a booklet that gives you a little more background on the characters of the series focusing mostly on the Sohma family members with some extra comments from the producers and creators of the series.  The amazon editorial pretty much gives you the basis of the series itself as that's pretty much the story,  but as you see the characters interact you can't help but find how fast they endear themselves to you.  The voice cast get top notch for their talents in doing the series both the Japanese voice cast and the English voice cast who put great talent and emotion into their character roles which brings the enjoyment of the series up a great deal.  The series will of course not be for everyone you have to look at a few episodes to get into the series and see if it's for you or not,  if you're a straight hardcore mecha or fighting action fan who doesn't care for the softer side animes then this is of course not for you but if you're opened to trying out some new genre series check this one out I'm sure you be getting this one for your anime library soon afterwords....",5,One Of The Few Most Memorable And Enjoyable Series To Date,1315008000,"09 3, 2011",2011,1921,"['series', 'more', 'romanticized', 'family-friendship', 'oriented', 'series', 'date', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'mecha/supernatural/action', 'fight', 'genres', 'usually', 'see', 'lot', 'animes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'episodes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'matter', 'how', 'entertaining', 'find', 'series', 'be', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'overall', 'video', 'quality', 'said', 'be', 'remastered', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'difference', 'earlier', 'release', 'set', 'audio', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'lot', 'sound', 'significantly', 'better', 'set', 'four', 'dvds', 'hold', 'entire', 'series', 'are', 'put', 'two', 'thin', 'dvd', 'case', 'cardboard', 'sleeve', 'pretty', 'much', 'earlier', 'set', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'good', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fifth', 'dvd', 'pretty', 'decent', 'selection', 'bonus', 'features', 'also', ""'ll"", 'get', 'booklet', 'little', 'more', 'background', 'characters', 'series', 'focusing', 'mostly', 'Sohma', 'family', 'members', 'extra', 'comments', 'producers', 'creators', 'series', 'amazon', 'editorial', 'pretty', 'much', 'basis', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'story', 'see', 'characters', 'interact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'find', 'how', 'fast', 'endear', 'voice', 'cast', 'get', 'top', 'notch', 'talents', 'doing', 'series', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'cast', 'English', 'voice', 'cast', 'who', 'put', 'great', 'talent', 'emotion', 'character', 'roles', 'enjoyment', 'series', 'up', 'great', 'deal', 'series', 'will', 'course', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'have', 'look', 'few', 'episodes', 'get', 'series', 'see', 'not', ""'re"", 'straight', 'hardcore', 'mecha', 'fighting', 'action', 'fan', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'softer', 'side', 'animes', 'then', 'course', 'not', ""'re"", 'opened', 'trying', 'out', 'new', 'genre', 'series', 'check', 'one', ""'m"", 'sure', 'be', 'getting', 'one', 'anime', 'library', 'soon', 'afterwords']",Fruits Basket - Volume 4: The Clearing Sky
742364,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B00008H2G4,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[7, 7]","I have my daughters to thank for my discovery of ""Fruits Basket.""  Without their interest in the manga and then the anime series, I probably never would have thought to give it a second glance.  But I'm so glad that I did.My first impression of the story was that it was the ultimate adolescent girl fantasy: a teenage girl meets several boys who, when she hugs them (usually by accident), they transform into animals of the Zodiac.  What could be more precious...and nauseating?  And yet, the story that develops from this premise -- a family whose members are cursed, generation upon generation, by the Zodiac animals -- is rich in character development and has much more depth than I originally expected.  This is a story of mystery and love, told with both pathos and humor.The animation for ""Fruits Basket"" is so beautiful as to defy description.  I'd be hard-pressed to find a single frame of animation that wasn't worthy of displaying on a wall in a gallery somewhere, and when such gorgeous drawings are put together in such a clever, unexpected way, the result is absolutely breathtaking.  The drawing style is light and funny, or somber and muted, or bright and colorful, as it serves the story and the characters.And what characters!  Tohru Honda is the driving force behind the story, the teenager who meets and befriends the Sohmas.  Her story is a tragic one, but the brave face she puts on it and her ruthlessly positive outlook are admirable.  Quite simply, Tohru has a way of looking at the world that is infectious, and affects everyone around her in surprising ways.  Tohru's best friends prior to meeting the Sohmas are Uo and Hana, who make frequent appearances in the story and add a great deal to it.  They go to school with Yuki Sohma (who changes into the Rat), the ""Prince"" of their school with his own fan club of appreciative girls.  Yuki lives with an older relative, Shigure (the Dog), an eccentric writer and perhaps my personal favorite character of the whole series.  Kyo Sohma (the Cat) also comes to live with them, and the long-standing antagonism between Kyo and Yuki quickly becomes the stuff of legend.  As the series goes on, Tohru meets more members of the Sohma clan.  Not all of them shape-change into animals, but many of them do, and before it's over she has met nearly every Zodiac animal.  We come to know each of the Sohmas, and through them, more about Tohru as well.  By the end of the show, these are characters that you can't help but care about.""Fruits Basket"" has a definite target audience -- adolescent girls like Tohru -- and as such, love and romance play a part.  But the good thing is that romance is not the only underlying element of the story, and it's told in such a clever, charming way that it doesn't become cloying or overdone.  Along the way, the story also examines love that turns to obsession, bonds of friendship, family ties, and acceptance of differences (sometimes big ones) between different people.  This last theme, acceptance, runs through the whole series, but becomes most powerful in the last few episodes.  If you think the original story of ""Beauty and the Beast"" but take away the Disney gloss and bring it back down to its classic roots, then add a background of Eastern rather than Western culture, you might be getting close to the sort of thematic effect ""Fruits Basket"" has.These themes are all there under the surface of ""Fruits Basket,"" but the surface is a story that made me laugh out loud more times than I can count, and made my eyes mist over almost as often. And in the last episode, it made me cry openly like a little kid -- not quiet tears that slip down your cheek, but the sort of tears that hurt your eyes and make your nose feel puffy.  Only the most jaded heart could watch the whole series and not be moved by what happens in the last episode.  If you think that a bunch of drawings and voices put together with the right story can't pack an emotional wallop...think again.""Fruits Basket"" is funny, it's honest, it's clever, it's beautiful to look at, it's unabashedly positive, and it's an absolute joy to watch.

742366,A3P3WYB24WLIVH,B00008H2G4,R. Rydberg,"[135, 186]","What's the most over-used word in the English language?Tell you in a moment.For now, meet the Sohmas. They're not your standard family. Because of a zodiac curse, various members turn into one of the Chinese zodiac creatures when embraced by the opposite sex.  So they've shielded themselves (to one degree or another) from the rest of the world.  In the first episode we are introduced to a household with three of the male Sohma's; Shigure (an older cousin/writer), Yuki and Kyo (both high school students). Others eventually join in. Yuki, being the rat, and Kyo, being the cat, do NOT get along. At all. Ever.Enter Tohru Honda, a high school girl (and classmate of the aloof, distant Yuki) who recently lost her only family member, her mother whom she loves and misses. This doesn't seem to have cost her a generally sunny disposition, though.  One day enroute to school she happens across the Sohma house. After they discover that she's temporarily living in a tent, they convince Tohru to accept their chivalrous offer to live with them. She insists that, in exchange, she repay them by performing housekeeping and cooking chores. Of course she soon discovers the Sohma secret, but is allowed to stay without her memory `wiped', the usual practice for these situations.Tohru is a textbook anime high school girl; adorable, long-legged, short-skirted, and demure.  With all the cooking and cleaning to be done for the guys of the house this would seem to be the perfect training ground for a submissive housewife.  But ordinary Tohru has extraordinary powers that can potentially change the Sohma's bleak, closed existence; a bottomless well of kindness, unending compassion, extreme empathy, unwavering loyalty, and the ability to gently say exactly the right thing at exactly the right time. Really, it's almost as if Star Trek's Deanna Troi were reborn. Tohru becomes the Sohma's de-facto councilor.  Which brings us to the most overused word in the English language:`Love.'OK, maybe it's just me, but it seems like that single word is used to cover so many diverse situations it can become meaningless.  Greek, on the other hand, has a number of words that can be used in place of our one like `eros' (romance, sensuality), filios (family, brotherhood), and agape (spiritual, godly).  As Tohru learns more about the Sohmas, she approaches them with loads of agape, and eventually filios is thrown in.This is a refreshing change from the standard anime fare when a lead character is surrounded by numerous members of the opposite sex, leading to `fan service' hijinx and a romantic storyline or ending (eros).  But that's not in evidence throughout this series.  Tohru's love for Yuki, Kyo and the rest of the clan is a growing, genuine, unconditional affection and appreciation for the people they are (agape), not the boyfriend that one of them might be.  And Tohru is a wonderful character, the kind of friend everyone wants, especially in high school.As promising as that sounds, the story tends to be predictable.  The first dozen episodes lean toward a gentle sitcom style with the aura of a nice, quiet bedtime story.  At appropriately inopportune moments, the Sohma's are accidentally `poofed' into their animal forms.  Amusing, yes, but after awhile it's not exactly `filling'.Changes occur at episode 13.  We find that the Sohma clan is not only cursed, it also has its dysfunctional side.  While this adds a good touch of unease to the story, it sometimes lends itself to characters and sub plots that are more irritating than interesting.  The editor and animators also add a few new techniques to the show's mix; perhaps they were getting a bit bored with the slow going themselves. But still, the rather saccharine base continues. Most episodes from13 to 23 are amusing, a couple feel like filler that could have been easily skipped.A note to those who crave a more intense storyline; you'll probably be tempted to give up after the first six or so episodes. But if you persevere until episode 24, congratulations! You are about to be rewarded.Throughout the series, Tohru's soothing of the Sohma's fate and ruffled feathers is fairly effortless on her part.  Just Tohru being herself is all they need to start breaking out of their self-imposed exile, to start feeling `human' again. She becomes completely entwined with the people she has grown to love and the family she is now a part of (filios).  But the tone shifts during episode 24 as storm clouds gather, literally and figuratively.  Tohru must face a horrific secret that the Sohma's have kept from her. Overcoming this will require not merely doing what comes naturally, but an exhaustive effort that will break her if she fails. Or she can run away, forever losing her new family, as well as that part of herself that is the core of her being.  The drama is exceptionally well played, with Evangelion overtones of what it means and costs to be human, living with and accepting other humans.  For the first time, the outcome is in doubt.  It is a worthy ending to an  `ok' anime.The music is average; violin, piano, flute and music box stuff that tends toward the fitting and uninspired.  Besides the ending theme, nothing here stands on it's own, but it is better than the mere `background noise' that some shows throw on the soundtrack.  The English vocal dub is excellent (kudos to the Tohru, Kyo and Shigure actors), but the original Japanese voices provide a better feel for the characters, especially Yuki.Fruits Basket is a fine introduction to anime in general, or the modern `shojo' style in particular. Getting the whole story on four disks makes for a great value.  The message is a good one; be yourself. Be kind, compassionate, and loyal to those who surround you, especially when extraordinary effort is required. You never can tell how much you're needed by those with seemingly impenetrable or uninviting exteriors.",3,"Sit boy, sit!

742369,A2YGSXBTOQOUQ4,B00008H2G4,[SaB],"[3, 3]","I love this anime not only because of the originality of the story but also because the characters are all so different and lovable in their own way, it just makes you want to hug em' all .. (well maybe not all of them, but most).The story I thought it was very original, because it's about this girl: Torhu Honda who suddenly finds herself living in a tempt in the woods after her mother died and she decided to not trouble her grandfather. Now, a regular person wouldn't care living with their grandparents, but Torhu is the extremely nice, sweet girl that's always apologizing. At a first glance her personality might seem annoying and just plain stupid, but actually is not so bad when mixed with the other dif personalities on the anime. She is the main character, because of her many things happen in the anime, you'll see. She then meets the Sohma family(don't know if that's how u write it) and starts living with them.So far is not interesting at all, now here comes the good part. This family has the curse of the chinese zodiac. Which means that they transform into the animals of the zodiac when hugged by someone of the opposite sex, or when they're feeling weak or sick. So the story revolves around Torhu meeting all of the members of the family and basically changing their lives. She is the only person outside the family that knows their secret and that means she is in a dangerous position, given the fact that the head of the family(a guy named Akito) has a history of being violent and traumatizing the family ... so who knows what he'll do to her?It's a SUPER FUNNY anime, it makes you pee your pants from time to time .. and it has mild romance between 2 of the characters and the girl. Every character is hilarious and it's really an anime you will want to watch more than once!The ending of the anime leaves you wanting for more though .. they don't quite explain everything and they leave you in the air.

Yet it was still also worth every penny for all the really good episodes.Also the english dubbing is horrible, so it's worth watching in Japanese with subtitles if necessary.",4,Between Heaven and Hell - 5 starts and 0 stars WARNING!!!,1128729600,"10 8, 2005",2005,736,"['anime', 'following', '-GREAT', 'Fantastic', 'comedy', 'cute', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'plot', 'line.Also', 'many', 'gut-wrenching', 'tear-jerker', 'deep', 'scenes', 'combined', 'side', 'splitting', 'comedy', 'combined', 'action', 'related', 'strange', 'plot.In', 'other', 'words', 'most', 'bipolar', 'anime', 'have', 'ever', 'watched.HOWEVER', 'BAD', 'things', 'Rather', 'unresolved', 'endingSome', 'say', 'things', 'are', 'resolved', 'ending', 'was', 'stuck', 'pulling', 'hair', 'out', 'are', 'rumors', 'second', 'season', 'nothing', 'happened', 'yet', 'so', 'rather', 'frustrating', 'have', 'such', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'series', 'was', 'still', 'also', 'worth', 'penny', 'really', 'good', 'episodes.Also', 'english', 'dubbing', 'horrible', 'worth', 'watching', 'Japanese', 'subtitles', 'necessary']",Fruits Basket - Volume 4: The Clearing Sky
742372,A3G25JIBBMS3G3,B00008H2G4,"Stephanie ""Anime/Game Geek""","[9, 9]","I'm really surprised there aren't more reviews for Fruits Basket, and I highly suspect that it's because the title is vague and possibly misleading to a lot of people.  So to any skeptics out there, I say give FB a chance and you'll find out what the title means in detail.  Aside from that, you'll laugh til you cry (I did anyway), and you might just cry until you feel sick.  Fruits Basket runs a gambit of emotions and still comes across as surprisingly realistic.  Speaking for myself, I was able to sympathize with all of the characters at one point or another, even the ""Prince Yuki Fan Club"" girls, though most of the time I would have been happy to strangle each one of them.  (If you're wondering why I said that, you'll have to watch the show.  ~_^)FB's animation is really beautiful, the characters are all interesting and lovable in their own special ways, and speaking as a fan of the English version by Funimation, the dub is fantastic.  There's a little bit of everything in this anime, and fans of happy endings will find Fruits Basket worth every penny.  And so, in closing I'll say this: the last 3 episodes will hit you like a freight train, and if you're anything like me, you'll definitely be left wanting more.

I bought this set based on some reviews I read about it online and not only was I satisfied I was also glad that I purchased it. The characters are amazing, the stories can range from sad to romance to funny. I was left wanting more so not only do I recommend picking up this set but I also recommend picking up the manga's from it as well because the anime only covers the first 7 volumes out of 23 and I guarantee you will want to know what happens with these characters after the anime.

It showed up on a free movie player so i started it and was compelled to continue to watch.  The characters all have really strong personalities that draws one in, and the humor directed towards adults made me giggle and laugh out loud; but then the redundancies began to pile up.  Toru's incessant selflessness began to get on my nerves, and then the 3 minute monologues of love and caring started showing up.""i failed a test and now i'm sick, i let you all down"" *crying (actual quote)awww Toru... now feel better so you can do our laundry, cook and clean for us BEFORE you go to school and your job.
