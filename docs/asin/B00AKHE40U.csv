In the movie, Room on the Broom, a witch and her cat take a journey on the witches broom. On their ride they continuously lose items which are found by other animals. These animals join the witch and cat on their trip.  The cat learns a few lessons on kindness and cooperation.  My kids loved that the squirrel and snake from The Gruffalo make an appearance at the beginning of the movie.

I just wasn't sure if it would really be something my two and a half year old would pay attention to. It looked like very beautiful animation, and sometimes, honestly, I think she just gets bored if it isn't bright and ""super animated"" if you know what I mean. WOW was this mama wrong. We received this movie in the mail right before heading out on a car trip that ended up being about two hours- and we watched this movie the WHOLE time. So, about 2.5 times total I guess? She was immediately captured by the fantastic animation, and the well-crafted story. She liked pointing out all the animals, and pointing out when the witch dropped her want ""oh no! ""and repeating the recognizable ""is there room on the broom for me"" phrase- which was adorable. She also was very interested in the insert with all the rest of the books by the author Julia Donaldson- and asked if we could ""get all of them"". We went to the library the next day and she was very happy to find ALL of the books there on the shelf waiting for her.

So you can guess that we were very excited to see that this great story was now being released as a video too. In watching this movie as a family I have to say that they have done a great job at capturing the wonderful feel of the book itself and added on some additional mannerisms about each of the characters that you cannot specifically see in the book which made the characters deeper with a longer back story.I also have to say that we enjoyed also watching the bonus features. This was the first time that we have been introduced to the author and gave us a more intimate knowledge to why the book was made in the way it was.All-in-all this movie does a great job at capturing all aspects of the book itself and whether you have read the book or not you too will like this as well.*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*,5,A Greta Movie for Kids!,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,996,"['family', 'been', 'fan', 'book', 'time', 'definitely', 'one', 'know', 'children', 'have', 'asked', 'read', 'many', 'times', 'past', 'can', 'guess', 'were', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'great', 'story', 'was', 'now', 'being', 'released', 'video', 'too', 'watching', 'movie', 'family', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'wonderful', 'feel', 'book', 'added', 'additional', 'mannerisms', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'specifically', 'see', 'book', 'made', 'characters', 'deeper', 'longer', 'back', 'story.I', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'also', 'watching', 'bonus', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'author', 'gave', 'more', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'why', 'book', 'was', 'made', 'way', 'was.All-in-all', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'aspects', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'not', 'too', 'will', 'like', 'as', 'well', '*I', 'received', 'copy', 'review', 'opinions', 'are', 'own*']",Room on the Broom anglais

It is not at all what I would expect from a witch story and when I realized the story was harmless, I read it to my kids.They both loved the story and immediately wanted to watch the DVD. The DVD is basically the story come to life. The only words are those from the book. I really liked this because the kids really had to pay attention and see all that happened between the dialogue. Actions really do speak louder than words.The only concern I'd have for younger children is the dragon is a little bit frightening. My four year old got a little scared when he showed up but when I asked if she wanted me to turn it off she said no.
