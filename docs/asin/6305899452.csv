482802,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,6305899452,Andres C. Salama,"[3, 3]","This made for TV Canadian adaptation of the Washington Irving story is more faithful than the Tim Burton movie. (Of the many things that were wrong with Tim Burton's version, perhaps the most jarring was the decision to made the headless horseman a real person, when in the book it is clear it is a prank to scare Ichabod Crane out of the village). Unfortunately, the fact that this is a faithful version does not necessarily mean that it is an interesting film to watch. In fact, it is pretty dull. The unknown actor portraying Crane doesn't help a lot, either. (Other actors in the movie are more appealing). Still, if you have read the original story, you might be interested to watch this version.",2,Faithful but dull,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,701,"['made', 'TV', 'Canadian', 'adaptation', 'Washington', 'Irving', 'story', 'more', 'faithful', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'movie', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'wrong', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'version', 'perhaps', 'most', 'jarring', 'was', 'decision', 'made', 'headless', 'horseman', 'real', 'person', 'when', 'book', 'clear', 'prank', 'scare', 'Ichabod', 'Crane', 'village', 'Unfortunately', 'fact', 'faithful', 'version', 'not', 'necessarily', 'mean', 'interesting', 'film', 'watch', 'fact', 'pretty', 'dull', 'unknown', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Crane', ""n't"", 'help', 'lot', 'either', 'Other', 'actors', 'movie', 'are', 'more', 'appealing', 'Still', 'have', 'read', 'original', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'watch', 'version']",The Legend of Sleepy Hollow VHS

I think, after seeing Burton's film, we sorta want that gothic horror film feel that he created. Not here. What this is is a faithful adaption of Irving's story.

I did find it intriguing as it started off with a conversation with the author Washington Irving. I love this story, but there were some things brought out here that I wasn't quite ready for, and that was the truth the lovely Katrina actually despised Ichabod, and turned him down for marriage. I guess it's because I can identify with this rejection as I've been rejected before. It also showed a stern Ichabod, and one who tried to show how spiritual he was by singing loudly, and impressively in the church to the point where he was able to sweet-talk the minister into letting him be choir director, and for what may have been immoral motives. A far cry from the Ichabod that I remember reading about, and hearing about as he had a humble nature about him. I've heard many versions of this story, and some were more memorable than others, but it's a story that you'll never forget, but when it comes to this version I just rather soon forget it. It's a version that just tried to be too truthful, and for those of us who still see the romantic side of Ichabod and Katrina we tend to not want to know that Katrina actually didn't love him at all.

482807,A1VVRE6L15FAKL,6305899452,"Kir Kanos TN ""kkanos""","[8, 9]","Unfortunately, I was VERY disappointed with this movie.  The movie was EXTREMELY boring and although the character of Ichabod Crane was more in keeping with Washington Irving's story, the movie as a whole lacked any real life (no pun intended).  The Disney cartoon was far more entertaining and a lot scarier too.  The characterization of Brom Van Brunt is totally innacurate as he is supposed to be a ""roughian"".  The portrayal of this role turned him into an overall nice guy and the actor was too much of a pretty boy to portray Brom Bones anyway.  Brom Bones was a lot more likeable than Ichabod in this movie.In terms of pace and suspense, this is at the  opposite spectrum of Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow.  Although I think Tim Burton totally Burtonized Sleepy Hollow completely and went to the extreme, at least ""Sleepy Hollow"" kept the audience's attention.  I agree that it had way too much gore and Burton also rewrote the entire mythology (Blasphemy). The soundtrack for this movie was absolutely AWFUL too.  Danny Elfman's Sleepy Hollow score (I recommend it) was an absolute masterpiece compared to this.  Also, in this movie the Headless Horseman shows up for all about 1 minute and does NOTHING except scare Ichabod as he tries to put a pumpkin where his head should be and then vanishes... YAAAAAAWNThe historical accuracy of this movie was flawed too and unfortunately the writers felt the need to change the history of the Battle of White Plains (which they renamed also) and said that not only did the Colonials drive the British away, but the Headless Horseman helped them do it in exchange for a bag of gold coins.  FYI:  The Battle of White Plains was a DEFEAT, BUT because General Howe let Washington withdraw, they regrouped and shortly thereafter won their first decisive victory against the British that turned the course of the Revolutionary War.If you are looking for a movie of Sleepy Hollow that you can show at an elementary school to first or second graders and fill 90 minutes of time look no further.  If you want to have an entertaining movie, that is historically accurate, is as spooky as the Legend of Sleepy Hollow should be, AND will keep your attention, THIS ISN'T IT.  In fact there isn't one... YETI wish somebody would make a ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" movie that is in keeping with Washington Irving's vision, historically accurate, but still has an interesting plot, suspense, and has more of the Headless Horseman in it.  Maybe I should write one myself.

482808,A3BNI43SIYOX4V,6305899452,reviewer,"[2, 6]","Read S. Medeiros's review below.  I don't mind saying s/he pretty much nailed it.  I had to watch this movie in installments because I just couldn't sit there for the entire duration.  Tim Burton's version has its own share of problems, the biggest being making Washington Irving's tale pretty much an action/adventure movie that is seriously lacking in script writing -- as other reviewers have said.  Still, Burton's effort is a long way better than Hallmark's.  I really didn't feel a thing with this movie, not fear, not wonder, not delighted or tickled.  Maybe just relieved when it was over.  Indeed, the Headless Horseman was pretty much laughable, and only appeared at the very end.  You almost felt lucky though that you hadn't seen him earlier because he was just as daft as Brent Carver's Ichabod.That is, contrary to S. Medeiros, I was not especially impressed with Brent Carver's portrayal.  Maybe it was indeed the Ichabod from the novel to a tee.  However, if that's the case maybe Burton had it at least partly right when he adapted Ichabod to be one that the viewer can have at least the remotest affinity with -- perhaps the difference between something you are to read and something you are to watch, I'm not sure.Watch it if you catch it on TV, and you're a big fan of the tale.  Otherwise, really, do yourself a favour and stay away.  And I say this as a big fan of the tale, and it does pain me to be critical of C-grade actors that are trying so hard and truly have more acting skill than I would ever have if I were to study drama for 10 years.  That said, again, this movie is just not fun.

482810,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,6305899452,Tsuyoshi,"[14, 14]","If there is one good thing about this made-for-TV ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" (produced by Canadian company Muse Entertainment and presented by Hallmark Entertainment), it is Brent Carver and his authentic portrayal of Ichabod Crane. From the very first moment when he appears on the deserted hill standing still like a scarecrow, Brent Carver becomes Ichabod Crane, lanky schoolmaster who has just arrived in secluded Sleepy Hollow.This Muse/Hallmark version is more faithful to Washington Irving's original short story than Tim Burton's Gothic horror adaptation. Probably some viewers would welcome the film's faithfulness while others might complain for the same reason. Though the production designs are convincing and photography is decent, the flat storytelling about the fate of hapless Ichabod and his romance is rather dull, lacking mood and nuance. Scenes of Headless Horseman are acceptable, but not outstanding.After watching Johnny Depp's performance as Ichabod, you may find the snobbish character of Ichabod a little off-putting at first, but Carver's fine performance and his nice comic touch makes him very human just like the counterpart in Irving's original. I think Katrina Van Tassel by Rachelle Lefevre is just OK, but sadly Paul Lemelin, who plays Brom Bones, is awfully miscast. He just doesn't look like the character from Irving's book and his acting needs much improvement.You may show this TV version in class (no beheading is included), but students might find it boring.

However, I'm also familiar with the original story by Washington Irving and aware that the Burton movie took many liberties with the plot.In ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" [1999], the story remains for the most part faithful to the original story, and has Brent Carver playing the title role of bumbling, ambitious schoolmaster Ichabod Crane. He is perfect in this role and I truly felt entertained by his eccentricities and clumsy gestures. His object of affection, the wealthy farmer's daughter, Katrina Van Tassel is ably portrayed by the pretty Rachelle Lefevre, who plays an intelligent young woman with dreams of travelling the world. Paul Lemelin plays Abraham Bones, the impoverished farmer who loves Katrina yet is frustrated by her reluctance to leave her parents for a new life elsewhere. As the story is stretched to about 1.5 hrs in length, the main focus of the story is the love' triangle' between Ichabod, Katrina and Abraham.I felt the movie dragged in some parts, possibly because the director felt certain scenes were necessary to 'pad' the story. It's difficult when the source story itself is just a short story, hence the resort to padding the storyline whilst staying faithful to the essence of the story.""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" is a family-friendly movie as there are no gory parts [unlike Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" which had truly scary parts and some disturbing themes] and the language is ""clean"".
