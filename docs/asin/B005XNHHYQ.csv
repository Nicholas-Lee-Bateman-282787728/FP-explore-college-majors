1505306,AW7VVW61YKZIQ,B005XNHHYQ,"J M P ""Hotel Mom 123""","[3, 4]","I had previously bought meet the sight words and meet the letters. The products are consistantly boring to adults but seem to hold a child's interest. Just like any of these products I did not force my child to watch them or have them on some calculated training regimen. My son was introduced to each DVD once and he watched them sometimes start to finish two to three times on his own, and now and again he would ask to watch them again. When we got meet the sight words he was interested in spotting words and reading but not mature enough to really blend letters. I did not think he was really mature enough for phonetic awareness when I purchased these as he was just barely 4 but he was a smart kid and eager to learn so I purchased them. He very quickly and easily learned these letter blends and between the sight word knowledge and the phonetic learning he could start reading very basic books. I credit this video for helping make the idea that letter blends and sounds allow you to read click.  It took him a little while but now at 5 he is using the combination of this program and is very good at reading compared to your typical child in pre-k. With a child who was interested in reading at a very young age, I the parent was often a little confused and concerned as to what the heck I should introduce him to next and these videos were a great tool. Now I cannot guarantee that your child is going to be an avid reader before kindergarten but when they are ready for the next step I really do feel these videos are a great tool to teach them what they need to know quickly. This was not a stand alone product for us: my son goes to school, we read together daily, watch word related tv shows...As a silly side note, just sold some of these DVDs at a yard sale and was pleased with the resale value. Overall this ended up to be a very low cost investment that I truly give some credit to helping my son progress in reading.",5,made a huge difference in reading,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,1937,"['had', 'previously', 'bought', 'meet', 'sight', 'words', 'meet', 'letters', 'products', 'are', 'consistantly', 'boring', 'adults', 'seem', 'hold', 'child', 'interest', 'Just', 'products', 'did', 'not', 'force', 'child', 'watch', 'have', 'calculated', 'training', 'regimen', 'son', 'was', 'introduced', 'DVD', 'once', 'watched', 'sometimes', 'start', 'finish', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'own', 'now', 'again', 'would', 'ask', 'watch', 'again', 'When', 'got', 'meet', 'sight', 'words', 'was', 'interested', 'spotting', 'words', 'reading', 'not', 'mature', 'enough', 'really', 'blend', 'letters', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'really', 'mature', 'enough', 'phonetic', 'awareness', 'when', 'purchased', 'was', 'just', 'barely', '4', 'was', 'smart', 'kid', 'eager', 'learn', 'so', 'purchased', 'very', 'quickly', 'easily', 'learned', 'letter', 'blends', 'sight', 'word', 'knowledge', 'phonetic', 'learning', 'could', 'start', 'reading', 'very', 'basic', 'books', 'credit', 'video', 'helping', 'make', 'idea', 'letter', 'blends', 'allow', 'read', 'click', 'took', 'little', 'now', '5', 'using', 'combination', 'program', 'very', 'good', 'reading', 'compared', 'typical', 'child', 'pre-k.', 'child', 'who', 'was', 'interested', 'reading', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'parent', 'was', 'often', 'little', 'confused', 'concerned', 'what', 'heck', 'should', 'introduce', 'next', 'videos', 'were', 'great', 'tool', 'Now', 'can', 'not', 'guarantee', 'child', 'going', 'be', 'avid', 'reader', 'kindergarten', 'when', 'are', 'ready', 'next', 'step', 'really', 'do', 'feel', 'videos', 'are', 'great', 'tool', 'teach', 'what', 'need', 'know', 'quickly', 'was', 'not', 'stand', 'alone', 'product', 'son', 'school', 'read', 'together', 'daily', 'watch', 'word', 'related', 'tv', 'shows', 'silly', 'side', 'note', 'just', 'sold', 'DVDs', 'yard', 'sale', 'was', 'pleased', 'resale', 'value', 'Overall', 'ended', 'up', 'be', 'very', 'low', 'cost', 'investment', 'truly', 'give', 'credit', 'helping', 'son', 'progress', 'reading']",Preschool Prep Series: Phonics Pack - Boxed Set

Meet the letters and meet the numbers are where my son learned his letters and numbers before he was 24 months old. I taught him phonics, so that DVD we do not watch. I usually turn these on while I make dinner. The only other thing I had found that was helpful (DVD wise) in teaching reading skills while I made dinner was the Leapfrog sing along dvd which teaches word families. This is wonderful! We were really struggling because he got sick of the Leapfrog DVD and we had nothing. Also, I think these are generally better at teaching than the Leapfrog DVDs. My son pays closer attention and survives my ""quizes"" better afterwards. Now I am confident he will also master blends. If only this company would come out with a DVD for word families, that would be spectacular (hey Preschool Prep, HINT HINT!).",5,Finally!,1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,921,"['have', 'been', 'waiting', 'something', 'went', 'simple', 'letters', 'sight', 'words', 'company', 'so', 'long', 'Meet', 'letters', 'meet', 'numbers', 'are', 'where', 'son', 'learned', 'letters', 'numbers', 'was', '24', 'months', 'old', 'taught', 'phonics', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'usually', 'turn', 'make', 'dinner', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'had', 'found', 'was', 'helpful', 'DVD', 'wise', 'teaching', 'reading', 'skills', 'made', 'dinner', 'was', 'Leapfrog', 'sing', 'dvd', 'word', 'families', 'wonderful', 'were', 'really', 'struggling', 'got', 'sick', 'Leapfrog', 'DVD', 'had', 'nothing', 'Also', 'think', 'are', 'generally', 'better', 'teaching', 'Leapfrog', 'DVDs', 'son', 'closer', 'attention', 'quizes', 'better', 'afterwards', 'Now', 'am', 'confident', 'will', 'also', 'master', 'blends', 'only', 'company', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'word', 'families', 'would', 'be', 'spectacular', 'hey', 'Preschool', 'Prep', 'HINT', 'HINT']",Preschool Prep Series: Phonics Pack - Boxed Set
