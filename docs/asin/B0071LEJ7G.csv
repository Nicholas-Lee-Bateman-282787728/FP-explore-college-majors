They still left it on a cliffhanger, and they left out huge important parts. I wish they'd showed more of Fai's story, and not left out the entire Celes fight. Other than that, I loved it. The artwork was just as good as in the show, and I'm really glad all the voices are the same. I can't really complain about it. It's beautifully written and arranged. Tsubasa is by far my favorite anime, and this OVA collection stays true to the story.",4,Not as good as the series,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,566,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'pulled', 'show', 'back', 'manga', 'trying', 'fit', 'information', 'five', 'OVAs', 'bit', 'much', 'still', 'left', 'cliffhanger', 'left', 'out', 'huge', 'important', 'parts', 'wish', ""'d"", 'showed', 'more', 'Fai', 'story', 'not', 'left', 'out', 'entire', 'Celes', 'fight', 'Other', 'loved', 'artwork', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'show', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'voices', 'are', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'complain', 'beautifully', 'written', 'arranged', 'Tsubasa', 'far', 'favorite', 'anime', 'OVA', 'collection', 'true', 'story']",N/A

It becomes very dark and bloody. Which is alot different from the anime. It's still very good. But I'm still disappointed that it doesn't finish the story. Definitely worth watching because it explains alot.,4,Great,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,344,"['great', 'series', 'ova', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'are', 'alot', 'different', 'anime', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'Tsubasa', 'times', 'very', 'dark', 'bloody', 'Which', 'alot', 'different', 'anime', 'still', 'very', 'good', ""'m"", 'still', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'finish', 'story', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'alot']",N/A

They find themselves in a wasteland where acid rain ruins everything. A strange evil is lurking in the shadows there. Shaoran must find a way to save Sakura and his friends. The task won't be easy. A new enemy has appeared. Shaoran is facing another version of himself. One of them is a clone and one of them is the original. Shaoran's fate may be sealed, and with his death, Sakura is also doomed.This is a pretty good OVA. I'm disappointed that they haven't taken the anime further. I believe the manga continues on, but I can't really get into that stuff. I recommend this OVA to any fan of the series.

1524097,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B0071LEJ7G,RavenRing,"[3, 3]","I'd read about half of the Tsubasa manga when I started the anime. I was enjoying the manga, seeing all the crossover characters and visiting so many new worlds. I really looked forward to seeing it come alive on the screen. Unfortunately, I found the anime was horribly boring and the whole second season was filler. But when I head that possibly my favorite part of the manga had it's own OVA, I knew I had to give it one more try. I am glad that I did!This OVA covers the part of the storyline where things actually happen. Some questions are answered and even more are raised (Syaoran will surprise you!). It doesn't end well, since it leaves you with a bunch of unanswered questions, but if you read the manga this isn't a problem. If you aren't interested in reading 28+ volumes of manga, well... you probably should't torture yourself by watching this OVA. The Tokyo Revelations OVA was my favorite of the two and it alone is worth buying the set for. $18 bucks for 5 episodes might seem a little pricy, but if you think of it more as a movie, it isn't all that bad. Also, at this time, theoriginal OVA setand SAVE OVA set are both the same price. I prefer the other set, since 1) it is available now and 2) it doesn't have the ugly green spine.",5,Much better than the original series!,1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,1252,"[""'d"", 'read', 'half', 'Tsubasa', 'manga', 'when', 'started', 'anime', 'was', 'enjoying', 'manga', 'seeing', 'crossover', 'characters', 'visiting', 'so', 'many', 'new', 'worlds', 'really', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'come', 'alive', 'screen', 'Unfortunately', 'found', 'anime', 'was', 'horribly', 'boring', 'whole', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'filler', 'when', 'head', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'part', 'manga', 'had', 'own', 'OVA', 'knew', 'had', 'give', 'one', 'more', 'try', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'OVA', 'part', 'storyline', 'where', 'things', 'actually', 'happen', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'even', 'more', 'are', 'raised', 'Syaoran', 'will', 'surprise', ""n't"", 'end', 'well', 'bunch', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'read', 'manga', ""n't"", 'problem', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'reading', '28+', 'volumes', 'manga', 'well', 'probably', ""should't"", 'torture', 'watching', 'OVA', 'Tokyo', 'Revelations', 'OVA', 'was', 'favorite', 'two', 'alone', 'worth', 'buying', 'set', '18', 'bucks', '5', 'episodes', 'might', 'seem', 'little', 'pricy', 'think', 'more', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Also', 'time', 'theoriginal', 'OVA', 'setand', 'SAVE', 'OVA', 'set', 'are', 'same', 'price', 'prefer', 'other', 'set', '1', 'available', 'now', '2', ""n't"", 'have', 'ugly', 'green', 'spine']",N/A

1524099,A1US7HC7RL2A8A,B0071LEJ7G,stowrag,"[5, 5]","To start, I recently bought this along with season two thinking the OVA continues the two seasons already out.  It doesn't.  The OVAs animate some of the events of the manga, but it doesn't continue the events of season two... in fact, it overwrites them.  The OVAs aren't for people who've been following the anime... they're for anyone familiar with the Tsubasa's story.  (Preferably ALL of Tsuabasa's story... otherwise you'll probably just be confused, because this is right where the story takes a turn for the weird)It's also important to note the two OVAs are disconnected.  Tokyo Revelations doesn't end at the beginning of Spring Thunder, and the events not shown between the two ovas are important.  Its not that the material just wasn't included... it was never animated to begin with.The OVA collection looks and sounds fantastic, and to be honest, it sells itself pretty well just on it's action, animation and soundtrack alone. If you are following the story, it's best to keep in mind it's more like an animated ""greatest hits"" from the late manga than a proper continuation of Season 2 of the anime.",5,"Not Season 3, but Well Worth Your Time",1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,1115,"['start', 'recently', 'bought', 'season', 'two', 'thinking', 'OVA', 'two', 'seasons', 'already', 'out', ""n't"", 'OVAs', 'animate', 'events', 'manga', ""n't"", 'continue', 'events', 'season', 'two', 'fact', 'OVAs', 'are', ""n't"", 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'anime', ""'re"", 'anyone', 'familiar', 'Tsubasa', 'story', 'Preferably', 'ALL', 'Tsuabasa', 'story', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'just', 'be', 'confused', 'right', 'where', 'story', 'turn', 'weird', 'also', 'important', 'note', 'two', 'OVAs', 'are', 'disconnected', 'Tokyo', 'Revelations', ""n't"", 'end', 'beginning', 'Spring', 'Thunder', 'events', 'not', 'shown', 'two', 'ovas', 'are', 'important', 'not', 'material', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'was', 'never', 'animated', 'begin', 'with.The', 'OVA', 'collection', 'looks', 'fantastic', 'be', 'honest', 'pretty', 'well', 'just', 'action', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'alone', 'are', 'following', 'story', 'best', 'keep', 'mind', 'more', 'animated', 'greatest', 'hits', 'late', 'manga', 'proper', 'continuation', 'Season', '2', 'anime']",N/A
