1508919,A1D60G5IR9U5Z0,B00632KSYM,Ryan Wilkes,"[5, 5]","This collection of films is perfect for any fan of movies about the ancient world!  300, Troy, and Alexander are three of my favorite movies and this set is the best deal out there!  The packaging is handsome and the blu-ray discs are intelligently contained and easy to get out and put back into the casing.  Any fan of these films should definitely invest in buying this set, even if you already have any of these on DVD because the blu-ray quality just makes it so much better.  300 is a beautifully done film and the story of how Ancient Greece was saved from destruction is a classic and timeless tale.  Troy really brings a big part of the Iliad to life and transports the viewer back into the carnage and passion of the most famous war in the Ancient World.  As for the motion picture, Alexander, I am a big fan of the final edition:  Alexander Revisited--The Final Cut.  In fact, I love this movie! I think it is one of the best historical films I've ever seen! When I originally saw the film  at the theater, I could tell that it had been heavily edited, but I still liked it. However, Oliver Stone's third edition of the film is excellent. The battle sequences are great, and I feel the film made an earnest effort to try and recreate the ancient pagan psychology of the time. Some of the scenes are a little difficult because the ancient world was simply more in touch with nature and the mystery, sexuality, and aimless wonder of life because modern life and society are simply less sincere and more arrogant than the world of the ancients. I think this innocence is endearing because Alexander the Great is such a difficult and bigger-than-life subject to tackle and this movie isn't afraid to showcase some of the most intimate and sacredly personal of feelings aroused by the difficult subject matter of the movie. I thought some of the scenes were really stunningly beautiful, especially the scenes of Alexander with his mother, Olympia, and the scenes set in Macedonia. I loved the parts of the movie that showcased Olympia's devotion to the Greek God Dionysus--the God of wine, ecstasy, theater, animal and plant nature!  I always loved the Greek Gods and loved reading stories about them and really enjoyed seeing that aspect of life in the film.  Everyone who has seen the Alexander Revisited edition of this film has seen a fine film!  These are three great movies!
