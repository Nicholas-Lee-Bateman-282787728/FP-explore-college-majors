1032094,AXA7OH47LBXZ7,B000K7VHOQ,,"[4, 4]","I love this wonderful series set in late 1800's California. In every episode we are treated to the Barkley clan navigating the physical and emotional terrain of the old west.  I particularly enjoy the personalities; Barbara Stanwyck is great as the strong, wise matriarch of the family. Peter Breck, Richard Long, Lee Majors, and Linda Evans each bring a unique perspective to their characters that give them identities that are engaging and interesting to follow.  The shows often feature guest stars from the golden days of Hollywood which supplies a richness to the series as well.What I don't like has nothing to do with the great series, but rather 20th Century Fox's marketing. The first set of DVD's from season one is complete.  Not so with the second season (only 1/2 of the shows), and the remaining three seasons are not even offered. I have seen this with other shows where just a couple of seasons are released and that's it.  I think if the decision to offer the series on DVD is made, they should commit and go all the way.  As it stands now, there is one and half seasons, and nothing more.  When and if the rest of this wonderful show will be released is anybody's guess.

I was just about to put season one of The Big Valley in my shopping cart when I stumbled across Season 2 PART 1. Breaking TV seasons up into two parts is nothing short of reprehensible. In comparison to producing new series, the studios have only minor production costs involved in releasing shows such as this on DVD at this late date. And at the rate they are releasing these classic shows, I will have to leave it to my great grandchildren to collect the final seasons. I will be long gone before they become available. The studios need to realize who their audience is. If they think the younger generations are all that interested in classic TV shows, I think they have a rude awakening coming.

Along with the dynamics of the closely-knit Barkley family itself--matriarch Victoria (Barbara Stanwyck), a no-nonsense and very modern lady who doesn't balk at addressing problems directly even if it means a lone foray into a burning desert; eldest son Jarrod (Richard Long), an attorney unafraid to use his fists, or a gun, if he has to; tough Nick (Peter Breck) and still-uncertain half-sib Heath (Lee Majors); and buxom, husky-voiced daughter Audra (Linda Evans)--there are numerous notable guests, including James Gregory as a hard-drinking desert guide, Colleen Dewhurst excellently portraying an outlaw mother who butts heads with Victoria, Buddy Hackett (with an imporobable Irish brogue) as a con artist who claims that he and not Tom Barkley fathered Heath, Nehemiah Persoff as a Mexican patriot general forced into flight by the Diaz regime, and James Whitmore, Sr., who portrayed Handy Random in the first season, as a gubernatorial candidate as slimy as anything you might see in more recent elections.  Most of the episodes are serious, and one (in which Jarrod, away from home, is injured and rendered amnesiac) is somewhat trite, but at least one is a comic hoot, with Victoria and Audra taken hostage by an inept trio of hillbillies (led by Warren Oates and Christopher Cary) resolved to break into a rail-depot safe come hell or high water.

It would be a shame if Fox stopped releasing the DVDs--which brings me to the info:After searching for a way to complain about the price-gouging on season two, I finally contacted a site that monitors DVD releases. They said sales of season one were poor and that Fox raised the price to recoup their losses. But since this half-set isn't selling well either, they probably won't release the rest.Maybe if all the people who bought season one decide to buy this set they'll release more. Maybe not. Personally, I think Fox bungled the whole thing. When it comes to short-run series (Big Valley only ran four seasons), it makes more sense to release the complete series (with extras) at a premium price. Most fans would pay more up front to get the whole series and not have to worry about studios dropping the project. As it is, Fox has done nothing but shortchange consumers and undermine its own profits.",5,Five stars for the series--and info on the price,1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,1040,"['Big', 'Valley', 'reruns', 'were', 'childhood', 'favorite', 'buying', 'set', 'season', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'show', 'up', 'memories', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'Fox', 'stopped', 'releasing', 'DVDs', 'info', 'searching', 'way', 'complain', 'price-gouging', 'season', 'two', 'finally', 'contacted', 'site', 'DVD', 'releases', 'said', 'sales', 'season', 'one', 'were', 'poor', 'Fox', 'raised', 'price', 'recoup', 'losses', 'half-set', ""n't"", 'selling', 'well', 'either', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'release', 'rest.Maybe', 'people', 'who', 'bought', 'season', 'one', 'decide', 'buy', 'set', ""'ll"", 'release', 'more', 'Maybe', 'not', 'Personally', 'think', 'Fox', 'bungled', 'whole', 'thing', 'When', 'short-run', 'series', 'Big', 'Valley', 'only', 'ran', 'four', 'seasons', 'more', 'sense', 'release', 'complete', 'series', 'extras', 'premium', 'price', 'Most', 'fans', 'would', 'pay', 'more', 'up', 'front', 'get', 'whole', 'series', 'not', 'have', 'worry', 'studios', 'dropping', 'project', 'Fox', 'done', 'nothing', 'shortchange', 'consumers', 'undermine', 'own', 'profits']","Big Valley - Season 2, Volume 1"

Unfortunately what we have here is only the first half of the second season, at the same price as the entire first season box set. There are, BTW, absolutely no ""extras"" included in this set to justify the much higher per-episode cost.As huge a Big Valley fan as I am - it was my favorite TV western growing up, and still plays amazingly well for me today - I'd suggest holding off on buying Season 2, Volume 1. For one thing, I suspect we just may being seeing a complete Season 2 box set in the near future, especially if sales on this half-effort are poor enough. For another, Fox needs to get the message that such blatant money grubbing schemes will not work, we're too smart for that. Support such greedy efforts by buying this set, I can pretty much guarantee we'll be seeing more such from Fox, quite possibly with the entirety of the rest of Big Valley.

1032151,A3BZSYJKZCRY03,B000K7VHOQ,Retro Pixie,"[3, 3]","I was happy to saddle up for another season of ridin' and ropin' in the valley.  Victoria, Jarrod, Nick, Heath and Audra are all back to protect the valley and do right by the ranchers.  The scripts are good, the acting is good and the stories are fun...and the added bonus is that some kind of amazing gene flows through the Barkley family to make them all stunningly gorgeous.  They do, indeed, sit pretty in the saddle...and everywhere else, for that matter.This is only half of the season that was 1966/67, but it's chock full of entertainment in the 15 episodes offered.  For starters, the guest stars include:  Joseph Campanella, Laura Devon, James Whitmore, Strother Martin, Colleen Dewhurst, Sheree North, Bill Quinn, Bruce Dern and Buddy Hackett in one of the weirdest casting choices ever to hit Hollywood...he gallops into town claiming to be Heath's real father and speaking with an Irish brogue.Favorite episodes are:  ""Caesar's Wife,"" where Audra's relationship with a young man makes his step-mother jealous.  Let's just say the step-mother is pretty creepy.  ""The Great Safe Robbery"" is a bit of a departure in that Barbara Stanwyck and Linda Evans show their comedic flair in reacting to three buffoons trying to rob a safe while holding the women hostage.  I also liked ""The Velvet Trap,"" where Nick falls for a woman who looks, for all the world, like a Dean Martin Gold Digger.  Nick loves her, but she's a woman with a secret.  She describes Nick as ""a violent summer storm with a rainbow at the end.""  She may have a secret, but it's not that she's a poet; that's for sure.  ""The Iron Box"" is also good where Nick and Heath are thrown into a prison.  Nick gets to beat the tar out of prison guards like some kind of super hero, and apparently a prison requirement was for Nick and Heath is to have their shirts unbuttoned.  I must say, it's a win-win!So, what have we learned from being in the Valley?  Well, Victoria has the waist of a 19-year-old girl, Jarrod is a lawyer you want on your side, Nick is a super hero, Heath is pretty gullible to ever think Buddy Hackett was his father and Audra inherited her mother's spunk.  And the most important thing...we'd like to keep riding through the Valley with the Barkleys, so Fox should release the rest of the seasons.  The Big Valley is big fun.

First, the cover art first released had two pictures of Lee Majors and none of Richard Long.  I am told it has been corrected, but has no one in the art department approving this ever even WATCHED the show?  They can't catch this mistake?  Pathetic.  Then they want to reach into the fans pockets and grab twice the money for HALF the episodes of the first season.  As more than one fan has brought out, I will continue to watch my shows taped off Encore Westerns, thank you.  At this rate it will take five or six years for all the seasons to be released on dvd.  DVD's are one of the cheapest things to make with a very high mark up and profit as it is.  What they are doing is gouging the true fans, and it is criminal.  One more thing.  Where are the special features???

I won't be surprised if more companies begin to follow suit.However, being a huge Big Valley fan for nearly thirty years, I have still gone ahead and purchased it.  There should be 15 episodes in this first volume since each season of the Big Valley had 30 episodes.  Fifteen episodes is still a fair amount compared with today's shows that put out 22 per season.The second season of the Big Valley continues the story of the Barkleys.  Season 2 is more solidified than the first season, even though the first season is very good.It contains the 2-part episode ""Legend of a General"" where Heath is taken prisoner in Mexico, and only the help of an old Mexican general, can help the Barkleys get him back.There's also ""Caesar's Wife"" in which, daring for its time, addresses a step-mother who makes advances toward her husband's son.""The Velvet Trap"" finds unsuspecting Nick falling in love with a woman who is, in fact, the girlfriend of a notorious outlaw and how she attempts to use Nick to get rid of a bounty hunter who is trying to track down the dangerous Jack Floyd.They also added The Big Valley's first comedic episode in ""The Great Safe Robbery"" in which three bumbling brothers attempt to steal and rob a safe from a train depot.  It's truly hilarious.There is also the classic Big Valley episode, ""Last Stage to Salt Flats"" which finds the family (except Nick and Audra) stranded in the middle of the desert after their stagecoach is robbed.All of the episodes in the season and in this volume are worth watching, especially since they will be unedited, and likely not seen by many viewers since they first aired, due to commercial time.Nick looks as sharp as ever in his black leather vest, gloves, and large brown hat.  He's also as fiesty and tempermental as ever, with plenty of great brawls for him to get into.  The episode, ""The Iron Box"" shows how angry he can get when someone in his family is attacked or threatened.  This is evident when Heath is tortured and brutalized by a demented prison warden, and Nick must figure out a way to save his brother when he is placed a sweat box.Victoria begins having some adventures and getting out of the house as Barbara Stanwyck insisted that Victoria have some stories not centered around wearing dresses and answering the door.This is a great show and a terrific season, even if you are only getting half, I think it's worth it.  They simply don't make westerns or T.V. shows like this with such great adventure stories as this.  Enjoy fifteen more episodes with California's favorite matriarchal family.",5,Still Worth Another Round With the Barkleys!,1166140800,"12 15, 2006",2006,2721,"['disappointing', 'see', 'have', 'decided', 'split', 'up', 'Season', '2', 'obviously', 'taking', 'step', 'pages', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'more', 'companies', 'begin', 'follow', 'suit.However', 'being', 'huge', 'Big', 'Valley', 'fan', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'have', 'still', 'gone', 'ahead', 'purchased', 'should', 'be', '15', 'episodes', 'first', 'volume', 'season', 'Big', 'Valley', 'had', '30', 'episodes', 'Fifteen', 'still', 'fair', 'amount', 'compared', 'today', 'shows', 'put', 'out', '22', 'season.The', 'second', 'season', 'Big', 'Valley', 'story', 'Barkleys', 'Season', '2', 'more', 'solidified', 'first', 'season', 'even', 'first', 'season', 'very', 'good.It', '2-part', 'episode', 'Legend', 'General', 'where', 'Heath', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'Mexico', 'only', 'help', 'old', 'Mexican', 'general', 'can', 'help', 'Barkleys', 'get', 'also', 'Caesar', 'Wife', 'daring', 'time', 'step-mother', 'who', 'advances', 'husband', 'son', 'Velvet', 'Trap', 'unsuspecting', 'Nick', 'falling', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'fact', 'girlfriend', 'notorious', 'outlaw', 'how', 'use', 'Nick', 'get', 'rid', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'who', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'dangerous', 'Jack', 'Floyd.They', 'also', 'added', 'Big', 'Valley', 'first', 'comedic', 'episode', 'Great', 'Safe', 'Robbery', 'three', 'bumbling', 'brothers', 'attempt', 'steal', 'rob', 'safe', 'train', 'depot', 'truly', 'hilarious.There', 'also', 'classic', 'Big', 'Valley', 'episode', 'Last', 'Stage', 'Salt', 'Flats', 'family', 'Nick', 'Audra', 'stranded', 'middle', 'desert', 'stagecoach', 'robbed.All', 'episodes', 'season', 'volume', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'will', 'be', 'unedited', 'likely', 'not', 'seen', 'many', 'viewers', 'first', 'aired', 'due', 'commercial', 'time.Nick', 'as', 'sharp', 'ever', 'black', 'leather', 'vest', 'gloves', 'large', 'brown', 'hat', 'also', 'fiesty', 'tempermental', 'ever', 'plenty', 'great', 'brawls', 'get', 'episode', 'Iron', 'Box', 'how', 'angry', 'can', 'get', 'when', 'someone', 'family', 'attacked', 'threatened', 'evident', 'when', 'Heath', 'tortured', 'brutalized', 'demented', 'prison', 'warden', 'Nick', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'save', 'brother', 'when', 'placed', 'sweat', 'box.Victoria', 'having', 'adventures', 'getting', 'house', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'insisted', 'Victoria', 'have', 'stories', 'not', 'centered', 'wearing', 'dresses', 'answering', 'door.This', 'great', 'show', 'terrific', 'season', 'even', 'are', 'only', 'getting', 'half', 'think', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'westerns', 'T.V', 'such', 'great', 'adventure', 'stories', 'Enjoy', 'fifteen', 'more', 'episodes', 'California', 'favorite', 'matriarchal', 'family']","Big Valley - Season 2, Volume 1"
