I just got this one and I know that it will also be a favorite that is used regularly. As for the previous review stating that she goes to fast...absolutely not true. What I love about this is she holds the poses a little longer that some other ""flow yoga"" dvd's. What I think the reviewer was referring to was Suzanne's continued instruction throught the session as to when to breathe and move into the next position. A feature I absolutely love. Once you become familiar with the workout and you don't need to constantly look at the tv you can do the whole session by just listening to her instruction which is very relaxing. I can do her weight loss dvd with my eyes shut thanks to her excellent cueing.

The pace is slow (although other reviewers are correct that she doesn't hold any one pose very long).  In spite of the fact that the poses are basic, I find the pace and something about Suzanne Deason's soothing voice makes me really focus on doing each one as mindfully and accurately as I can.

(The program is in 3 parts:  Breath, which seems easy but really makes you learn to use breath, Posture, a fast moving flowing and balance oriented section, and Centering, which is a lot of twisting and stretching with breath.)  However, now that I feel more confident -- I think I'm somewhere between beginner and intermediate level -- I just love this program.  I am still not flexible enough to do all the moves but the grace and beauty of the program entrances me.  And I always feel calm, centered, stretched and balanced when I finish.

717417,A2VREJW7HAWVUQ,B00006IX6K,"Elizabeth Haynes ""Writer""","[6, 6]","I'm updating my review on this one, after pulling it out for the first time in a few years.  This used to be one of my favorite DVDs, however I don't really enjoy it much now.Knowing more about yoga and being more physically fit now, I find that the poses in the ""Posture"" section of the practice are challenging, but the flow of the practice in general is slow and a bit choppy.  Meaning that she doesn't build and maintain heat in the body.  If you are looking for a vinyasa flow, which I like, this really isn't it.  There are no downward dogs in between poses.  She doesn't move between poses in a fluid motion.  She usually stops and tells you to put your hands on your belly, rather than going into a more active resting pose like standing forward bend or downward dog.I think what bothers me most is that in the last section, she will do restorative poses and then more active ones, then restorative ones again.  It doesn't feel right.  My body tries to cool down and relax, then she suddenly wants me to do a demanding abdominal pose, then cool down and relax again.So my overall opinion is it could be great, because it's a great intermediate dvd and the setting is beautiful.  And I also do use muscles that I don't use in other programs.  But it just doesn't seem to flow correctly (where you warm the body, do active poses, maintain heat, and cool down with restorative poses).  But what I do like is that there are many standing poses that don't find in other videos.",2,Changing my mind on this one,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,1480,"[""'m"", 'updating', 'review', 'one', 'pulling', 'out', 'first', 'time', 'few', 'years', 'used', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'DVDs', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'much', 'now.Knowing', 'more', 'yoga', 'being', 'more', 'physically', 'fit', 'now', 'find', 'poses', 'Posture', 'section', 'practice', 'are', 'challenging', 'flow', 'practice', 'general', 'slow', 'bit', 'choppy', 'Meaning', ""n't"", 'build', 'maintain', 'heat', 'body', 'are', 'looking', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'like', 'really', ""n't"", 'are', 'downward', 'dogs', 'poses', ""n't"", 'move', 'poses', 'fluid', 'motion', 'usually', 'put', 'hands', 'belly', 'rather', 'going', 'more', 'active', 'resting', 'pose', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'downward', 'dog.I', 'think', 'what', 'bothers', 'most', 'last', 'section', 'will', 'do', 'restorative', 'poses', 'then', 'more', 'active', 'ones', 'then', 'restorative', 'ones', 'again', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'body', 'cool', 'down', 'relax', 'then', 'suddenly', 'do', 'demanding', 'abdominal', 'pose', 'then', 'cool', 'down', 'relax', 'again.So', 'overall', 'opinion', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'great', 'intermediate', 'dvd', 'setting', 'beautiful', 'also', 'do', 'use', 'muscles', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'other', 'programs', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'flow', 'correctly', 'where', 'warm', 'body', 'do', 'active', 'poses', 'maintain', 'heat', 'cool', 'down', 'restorative', 'poses', 'what', 'do', 'like', 'are', 'many', 'standing', 'poses', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'other', 'videos']",Yoga Conditioning for Women

The next section, postures, was challenging for me, in the sense that it requires of good balance on one leg (eagle pose, tree pose, half-moon pose, dancer pose, warrior III pose) and the yoga practice flows swiftly.  If you are more experienced with yoga and can change poses quickly and efficiently, you'll really enjoy this practice.  If you're like me and you're not quite that experienced, you'll get frustrated.The last section, centering, is relaxation and is nice and calming.
