I am not a big fan of Shonda Rhimes other shows, so I did not hold out hope beyond my standard three episode trial period.  Scandal however is a show that sucks you in and keeps you anoxiously wanting more.  The storylines, each week has a new case of the week, but there are two primary stories that neatly play out, develop and dove tail with several of the COTW.  The ways in which the stories play out keep you guessing and coming back for more.While KW is clearly the focal point of the show and she does a fabulous job of carrying it, the supporting players add the necessary meat to Scandal to make it must see television.  Tony Goldwyn of Ghost fame is fabulous as the POTUS, and together, he and Washington combine to make the hottest couple I have seen on either the big or small screen in quite some time.  Bellamy Young as the FLOTUS is like a smiling coiled viper, in the best possible way.  And they are just the beginning of the terrific cast that rounds out this show.  From Cyrus, to Steven, to Huck, all of the players are top notch and their excellent casting serve to make Scandal a terrific show that if handled right and given a real chance by the network could become a phenomenal and long running series.I hesitated on buying the season because it was only seven episodes, but am glad that I made the purchase because rewatching enables you to clearly see the clues that were laid out for the viewer.  Naturally, upon second watching, some scenes take on a new and deeper meaning knowing how things play out, some make you wonder how you missed them the first time around, others have,you wondering if you are seeing things differently based on knowing what happens.  In essence, it has all the elements that make a good mystery worth repeated viewing/reading.My one negative is the insipid Quinn character who walks, talks, thinks, and acts like a deer in the headlights.  I don't know if Rhimes wants us to feel protective of or sorry for Quinn, but I personally find that I can't stand the character, and I feel that if she were to disappear from the canvass not only would I not notice, but the show would be greatly improved.",5,Excellent New Drama,1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,2218,"['started', 'watching', 'Scandal', 'mainly', 'support', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Shonda', 'Rhimes', 'other', 'shows', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'out', 'hope', 'standard', 'three', 'episode', 'trial', 'period', 'Scandal', 'however', 'show', 'keeps', 'anoxiously', 'wanting', 'more', 'storylines', 'week', 'new', 'case', 'week', 'are', 'two', 'primary', 'stories', 'neatly', 'play', 'out', 'develop', 'dove', 'tail', 'several', 'COTW', 'ways', 'stories', 'play', 'out', 'keep', 'guessing', 'coming', 'back', 'more.While', 'KW', 'clearly', 'focal', 'point', 'show', 'fabulous', 'job', 'carrying', 'supporting', 'players', 'add', 'necessary', 'meat', 'Scandal', 'make', 'must', 'see', 'television', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'Ghost', 'fame', 'fabulous', 'POTUS', 'together', 'Washington', 'combine', 'make', 'hottest', 'couple', 'have', 'seen', 'big', 'small', 'screen', 'quite', 'time', 'Bellamy', 'Young', 'FLOTUS', 'smiling', 'coiled', 'viper', 'best', 'possible', 'way', 'are', 'just', 'beginning', 'terrific', 'cast', 'out', 'show', 'Cyrus', 'Steven', 'Huck', 'players', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'excellent', 'casting', 'serve', 'make', 'Scandal', 'terrific', 'show', 'handled', 'right', 'given', 'real', 'chance', 'network', 'could', 'become', 'phenomenal', 'long', 'running', 'series.I', 'hesitated', 'buying', 'season', 'was', 'only', 'seven', 'episodes', 'am', 'glad', 'made', 'purchase', 'rewatching', 'enables', 'clearly', 'see', 'clues', 'were', 'laid', 'out', 'viewer', 'Naturally', 'second', 'watching', 'scenes', 'take', 'new', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'knowing', 'how', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'make', 'wonder', 'how', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'others', 'have', 'wondering', 'are', 'seeing', 'things', 'differently', 'based', 'knowing', 'what', 'essence', 'elements', 'make', 'good', 'mystery', 'worth', 'repeated', 'viewing/reading.My', 'one', 'negative', 'insipid', 'Quinn', 'character', 'who', 'talks', 'thinks', 'acts', 'deer', 'headlights', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Rhimes', 'feel', 'protective', 'sorry', 'Quinn', 'personally', 'find', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'character', 'feel', 'were', 'disappear', 'canvass', 'not', 'only', 'would', 'not', 'notice', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'improved']",Scandal: The Complete First Season

Few TV programs can beat  ""Grey's Anatomy"" in terms of substance, quality and acting, but ""Scandal"" ain't too shabby. It debuted on ABC on April 5, 2012.The storyline revolves around a former White House communications director, Olivia Pope, (Kerry Washington),  who now runs her own crisis management firm, Olivia Pope & Associates - a business with a particular twist. Her clients are those well known figures, usually political, who get themselves into deep doo-doo. Think Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, John Edwards and Reille Hunter, Richard Nixon and Watergate, etc. The catch here is that Olivia and her team of ""gladiators in suits,"" have to believe in their clients' innocence before they take the case. Olivia is regarded as the best ""fixer"" in Washington.Ms. Pope's team are all self proclaimed ""weirdos,"" - you have to watch the show to see how weird. One has to be out of the main stream to be hired by Olivia. The cast of her co-workers/employees are: Harrison Wright, (Columbus Short ). Harrison worked for a firm whose CEO was prosecuted for insider trading. Harrison  was sentenced to a relatively long prison sentence because of his association with the firm. Olivia defended him pro bono because he was innocent of all charges, thus terminating the jail time. This earned her Harrison's eternal loyalty.Abby Whelan, (Darby Stanchfield), works as an investigator in Olivia's firm. Abby was married to the son of a former Virginia governor.  She left him when he beat her in a drunken rage. Olivia got a tire iron and broke Charles's kneecap. She also helped Abby get the best divorce attorney in the state to help her get out of her marriage. Abby is also extremely loyal to Olivia.Quinn Perkins, (Katie Lowes), a new employee, is definitely not who she claims to be. Some of the episodes deal with Quinn's identity and the serious problems she has with the law.My favorite character, Huck, (Guillermo Diaz), is totally ""strange.""  Another extremely loyal team member, he works as a tech guy in Olivia's firm. He is willing to do anything she asks of him. Olivia found the homeless Huck while she was working on a presidential campaign for the same candidate who is now president. She is VERY involved with our head of state. Anyway, she took a shining to Huck and brought him coffee every day. Prior to knowing Olivia, and after serving in the Marines, Huck was blackmailed into joining a top secret C.I.A. program called B613, where he was trained to torture and murder American ""traitors"".Non-Pope employees but reoccurring characters include: Cyrus Rutherford Beene, (Jeff Perry), White House Chief of staff; Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III ""Fitz,"" (Tony Goldwyn), as of the President of the United States; First Lady Melody ""Mellie"" Grant, (Bellamy Young), David Rosen, (Joshua Maline),  Assistant US Attorney; Sally Langston, extremely conservative Vice President of the US.Season one focuses on the lives of the team members, the relationship between Olivia and the president (her former employer).The downside of ""Scandal"" is that the episodes and dialogue seem to run on cocaine. Everyone talks fast and the pace is beyond fast. It is really necessary to pay attention because you can miss something important if you blink your eyes twice in a row.

1534612,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007MDB6Y2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 13]","""Scandal"" is one of those shows that I debated whether I really wanted to watch or not. From the previews, it seemed like it might have potential but, most importantly, it looked to be a bit different from other programs on network TV. I don't know about you, but I am so sick of the dozens and dozens of by-the-book crime procedurals on the air. Created by Shonda Rhimes of ""Grey's Anatomy"" fame, the show promised political machinations and juicy plotting in that den of inequity called Washington D.C. (where scandals are a way of life)! While I gave up ""Grey's"" a few seasons ago and never connected with ""Private Practice,"" I will concede that Rhimes has a knack for putting together an interesting cast. And, ultimately, that's why I decided to give the show a try (and the fact that at seven episodes, it wasn't a huge commitment). Truthfully, I had a pretty open mind--but, in every way, the show exceeded my expectations. It certainly isn't perfect (many of the supporting characters have yet to be integrated effectively or developed in any tangible way), but it's got a number of elements that really make it stand out.The show is centered (and I do mean centered) around Kerry Washington as perhaps the most powerful woman in D.C. She and her staff work as professional ""fixers"" helping to extricate high profile clients from potentially scandalous or criminal situations. In truth, none of the individual cases are particularly revelatory as they follow a certain ripped-from-the-headlines format, but the show can be quite fun and engaging as the team race the clock to solve the weekly mysteries. Yes, in that way, some of the show is the dreaded procedural that I just complained about. But what ""Scandal"" does well is develop a more intriguing continuing story that goes all the way into the White House. The President (Tony Goldwyn) himself is a major player in the intrigue and this plot thread is very well acted and absolutely fascinating.Don't worry, though, this isn't a serious study of the political scene. ""Scandal,"" more than anything, is just fun. That's what I didn't expect. The pacing is in overdrive, the plotting is overwrought, and the drama is absolutely over-the-top (and I mean every one of those things as a compliment). The show races forward at a breakneck speed (sometimes leaving a plot hole or two) and provides sheer adrenaline-rush entertainment. Washington is absolutely terrific (she should be a huge star) and this is the best role Goldwyn has had in years. Other members of the cast are appealing, but have had less impact. Most noteworthy, for me, are Henry Ian Cusick (Lost) as Washington's right hand man, Jeff Perry (Grey's) as the President's Chief of Staff, and Liza Weil (Gilmore Girls) as a woman caught in the season's biggest story line.""Scandal"" is both a procedural and an adult soap opera set in the political arena. I enjoyed the on-going storylines more than the ones that were wrapped up neatly in each episode. But it's glossy, slick, and wildly entertaining. The show has lots of promise and if it returns for a second season, it will have the chance (hopefully) to develop into something even richer and more rewarding.

I had hoped that Season One would explain some of what happened in Season Two but there seems to be a disconnect. I don't want to give away any spoilers but other than revealing that Quinn is a client rather than an employee there isn't very much detail given of her history, she is one of the main story arcs so that's disappointing. One male character just abruptly vanishes from the story between the two seasons. The scene where Huck tortures &#34;Charlie&#34; also doesn't make sense, Plus there is never any explanation of why Huck is living as a homeless person or how Olivia knows him, her &#34;past&#34; is NOT explored in either series. The relationship between Olivia and Fitz is weird but Fitz's relationship with his wife is even weirder.

There are other talented actors and actresses in this series as well and it is hard for me to narrow it down to just one favorite. However, I admit that I also greatly enjoyed the characters of Abby Whelan (played in a passionate way by Darby Stanchfield) and Huck (played in a natural way by Guillermo Diaz). There is a scene in the series where the character of Abby Whelan speaks up in regards to protecting the wife of a client. You then have the character of Huck who carefully and discreetly carries out certain dealings for Olivia. However, a viewer would also get the feeling that he is doing this from the noble intent to help out Olivia in the best way he can.

So basically, you are lost without a constant review unless you have eidetic memory.  And this is why most series of this sort end up being cancelled abruptly and prematurely due to declining interest and ratings. this series is basically a nighttime soap opera with too much time between episodes - which is why daytime soaps require daily episodes with inter-seasonal reruns in order to maintain audience level continuity.  Soap operas always fail on extended seasonal scheduling with too long of breaks between episodes.Additionally, and as far as this Amazon Prime offering is concerned:For a short while, the first two seasons of this series were available for free viewing to Amazon Prime customers, which hooked a lot of people including me) into purchasing season 3.  But the mid-season break was so long that I have now forgotten the story line and need a review.
