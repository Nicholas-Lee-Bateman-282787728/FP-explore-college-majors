The music was more like noise to me and that is because the singers wouldn't stop singing. If there had been a few instrumental songs like other Cirque shows, I'd have enjoyed this show a bit more. Cirque shows were about dreams and fantasy. They didn't directly point out cultures, though they made indirect references to them. There is no ""up and down"" to the emotion in the show. There's just lots of noise and energy from begining to end which gets annoying. So its way too much ""up.""

565037,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B000053V59,Amanda,"[2, 2]","Dralion has always been a tough one for me. As a big Cirque du Soleil fan, I love shows like Quidam, ""O,"" and Varekai, but, while I did enjoy Dralion, it's just not one of my favorites. Perhaps its the more traditional circus nature of the show, perhaps its the somewhat-overdone themes, the more mechanical movement of some of the performers, or the more Eastern-inspired elements. Something about all of this things, particularly the more ""circus"" aspect, tend to turn me off on Dralion a little bit. That said, the filming of this show was fairly well done, and the vibrant colors of Dralion really come alive.Dralion is based on the idea of colliding cultures: East meets West. Even the name ""Dralion"" and its namesake characters represent this fusion. ""Dra"" comes from the Eastern dragon and ""lion"" is the more Western lion. With this concept in mind, Dralion's universe represents different countries throughout the world. The music has a strong world flavor to it, with heavy drums, tribal and Middle Eastern influences. The Dralion universe is also divided into four different groups representing the four elements: earth, fire, air and water. Each group is led by a character meant to represent different areas of the world: air=Europe/Americas, earth=Africa, fire=Asia, Water= Middle East.Unlike other Cirque shows, Dralion includes more Asian acts than others, thus, a stronger Asian cast. Some of these acts include ""Umbrella Juggling,"" ""Teeterboard,"" and ""Skipping Ropes."" Dralion also includes the wonderfully artistic ""Aerial Pas de Deux,"" an aerial silks act mixed with ballet that tells a heartbreaking story of two air characters.The costumes in Dralion follow the element color palate very closely (fire=red, air=blue, earth=green, earth=orange), which leads to bright, exciting visuals that make the performers jump off the stage, same with the sleek, modern set and the lighting. Everything about Dralion is louder and brighter than most Cirque shows, giving it a different look.While I wouldn't say Dralion is my favorite show, it's still enjoyable, great for families and easily accessible.",4,East meets West,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,2113,"['Dralion', 'always', 'been', 'tough', 'one', 'big', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'fan', 'love', 'shows', 'Quidam', 'O', 'Varekai', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Dralion', 'just', 'not', 'one', 'favorites', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'traditional', 'circus', 'nature', 'show', 'perhaps', 'somewhat-overdone', 'themes', 'more', 'mechanical', 'movement', 'performers', 'more', 'Eastern-inspired', 'elements', 'Something', 'things', 'particularly', 'more', 'circus', 'aspect', 'tend', 'turn', 'off', 'Dralion', 'little', 'bit', 'said', 'filming', 'show', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'Dralion', 'really', 'come', 'alive.Dralion', 'based', 'idea', 'colliding', 'cultures', 'East', 'meets', 'West', 'Even', 'name', 'Dralion', 'namesake', 'characters', 'represent', 'fusion', 'Dra', 'Eastern', 'dragon', 'lion', 'more', 'Western', 'lion', 'concept', 'mind', 'Dralion', 'universe', 'different', 'countries', 'world', 'music', 'strong', 'world', 'flavor', 'heavy', 'drums', 'tribal', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'influences', 'Dralion', 'universe', 'also', 'divided', 'four', 'different', 'groups', 'representing', 'four', 'elements', 'earth', 'fire', 'air', 'water', 'group', 'led', 'character', 'meant', 'represent', 'different', 'areas', 'world', 'air=Europe/Americas', 'earth=Africa', 'fire=Asia', 'Water=', 'Middle', 'East.Unlike', 'other', 'Cirque', 'shows', 'Dralion', 'more', 'Asian', 'acts', 'others', 'thus', 'stronger', 'Asian', 'cast', 'acts', 'include', 'Umbrella', 'Juggling', 'Teeterboard', 'Skipping', 'Ropes', 'Dralion', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'artistic', 'Aerial', 'Pas', 'de', 'Deux', 'aerial', 'silks', 'act', 'mixed', 'ballet', 'heartbreaking', 'story', 'two', 'air', 'characters.The', 'costumes', 'Dralion', 'follow', 'element', 'color', 'palate', 'very', 'closely', 'fire=red', 'air=blue', 'earth=green', 'earth=orange', 'bright', 'exciting', 'visuals', 'make', 'performers', 'jump', 'stage', 'same', 'sleek', 'modern', 'set', 'lighting', 'Everything', 'Dralion', 'louder', 'brighter', 'most', 'Cirque', 'shows', 'giving', 'different', 'look.While', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'Dralion', 'favorite', 'show', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'families', 'easily', 'accessible']",N/A

Jeanclerc ""Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","[22, 24]","Every Cirque performance is worth seeing at least once, and while the DVDs can't possibly do justice to the live experience, they're entertaining momentos.  I recently saw Dralion live, so I've got that reference for comparison to this DVD edition.Strictly as a performance, Dralion is not my favorite.  Not that it's bad in any way - just disappointing in the opportunities that it misses.  Given the rich visuals of Eastern culture to work with, the show could have been the most beautiful of the Cirque lineup.  However, it inexplicably strays into other cultures (African, Indian, etc.) and never really picks up any theme at all.  Plus, while other Cirque shows follow a plot, albeit a highly conceptual one, Dralion comes off as just a series of acts, almost like a best-of or singles compilation album.  Again, the performance is still wonderful to behold - it's just not the strongest one that I've seen.The DVD presentation itself is very good.  Director David Mallet maintains a very consistent look with the &quot;Quidam&quot; DVD that he also helmed.  I'm guessing that the two were probably filmed for the same European TV broadcast purpose.  The DVD also includes a couple of acts which are not always being performed live on the current North American tour of Dralion, i.e. the light bulb ballet and see saw jumps.  Unfortunately, however, it has the same clown sequences as the ones included in Quidam - they're very funny, but it's a shame to have a repeat on the two discs.  Finally, the DVD also makes very good use of the multiple angles feature on certain acts.All in all, I recommend the DVD for Cirque collectors.  If you're just getting into Cirque, I recommend the &quot;Quidam&quot; DVD instead. Or, if you really want to be awestruck, go see &quot;O&quot; in Las Vegas.",3,"It's Cirque, but not Cirque at its Best",1060214400,"08 7, 2003",2003,1796,"['Cirque', 'performance', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', 'DVDs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'do', 'justice', 'live', 'experience', ""'re"", 'entertaining', 'momentos', 'recently', 'saw', 'Dralion', 'live', 'so', ""'ve"", 'got', 'reference', 'comparison', 'DVD', 'edition.Strictly', 'performance', 'Dralion', 'not', 'favorite', 'Not', 'bad', 'way', 'just', 'disappointing', 'opportunities', 'Given', 'rich', 'visuals', 'Eastern', 'culture', 'work', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'beautiful', 'Cirque', 'lineup', 'However', 'inexplicably', 'other', 'cultures', 'African', 'Indian', 'etc', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'theme', 'other', 'Cirque', 'shows', 'follow', 'plot', 'highly', 'conceptual', 'one', 'Dralion', 'off', 'as', 'just', 'series', 'acts', 'almost', 'best-of', 'singles', 'compilation', 'album', 'Again', 'performance', 'still', 'wonderful', 'behold', 'just', 'not', 'strongest', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen.The', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'very', 'good', 'Director', 'David', 'Mallet', 'very', 'consistent', 'look', 'quot', 'Quidam', 'quot', 'DVD', 'also', 'helmed', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'two', 'were', 'probably', 'filmed', 'same', 'European', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'purpose', 'DVD', 'also', 'couple', 'acts', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'being', 'performed', 'live', 'current', 'North', 'American', 'tour', 'Dralion', 'i.e', 'light', 'bulb', 'ballet', 'see', 'saw', 'jumps', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'same', 'clown', 'sequences', 'ones', 'included', 'Quidam', ""'re"", 'very', 'funny', 'shame', 'have', 'repeat', 'two', 'discs', 'Finally', 'DVD', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'use', 'multiple', 'angles', 'feature', 'certain', 'acts.All', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Cirque', 'collectors', ""'re"", 'just', 'getting', 'Cirque', 'recommend', 'quot', 'Quidam', 'quot', 'DVD', 'instead', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'awestruck', 'go', 'see', 'quot', 'O', 'quot', 'Las', 'Vegas']",N/A

I think it was worth waiting almost 11 years for him to see the version of circus otherwise known as Cirque du Soleil.All the elements of a traditional circus are here--the jugglers, the clowns, the acrobats and high wire artists, even the animal acts.  You will have to think outside the box to recognize some of them, however, and that is the joy of Cirque's unique show.  This particular show focuses on the four elements and many versions of world beat music and dance are displayed. The acrobats and high wire artists are amazing, especially the very young girl who is a hand balancer.  The clowns are completely hilarious, and though hard-pressed to choose a favorite of all the amazing acts, my kids liked their brand of slapstick.Viktor, the juggler, is so unique that it took me a while to equate his performance with standard juggling acts, he was so hypnotic to see.  Everything in this show is incomparable and totally enjoyable, from the staging to the music, which was live at the tent, to the performers themselves.  My husband, who would never be caught dead in a place like Vegas, discovered they have two permanent acts there, and is ready to book a flight!If you are not able to see one of their shows live, be sure to catch them on screen.

I also own the DVD's of Quidam, Alegria (the show filmed in Sidney not the film) and Varekai, which I purchased toguether with this new Dralion Superbit version.  Until now Dralion had been my least favorite of the four shows.  Not that it was bad but its just that Quidam was so much better.  My problem was that as much as I tried I could never get the same sound from my original Dralion DVD.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 track was so bad that at first I returned the DVD because I guessed I had a damaged product, and it was not.  However, this new Superbit version with DTS sounds so crisp and powerfull that I have just rediscovered the show in a whole new way.  If you already own Dralion...the new DTS track on the Superbit version is so good that alone makes the purchase worth it.  Its a completely new experience.

565052,A179GX8E3M4G52,B000053V59,"Mr D. ""Artist/Designer/Kibitzer""","[6, 7]","Dralion is the third video I've watched of the Cirque du Soleil series. For those of you not familiar with Cirque, it is seems to be a mergence of extremely well done circus acts, sans the animals, in a floor show format. Indeed, two versions of Cirque shows are currently holding forth in showrooms in prominent Las Vegas Hotels. I say versions because that's what they are. Unlike a play which can be replicated by different actors, Cirque is limited by what each particular performer does. This is both a weakness and a strength of Cirque and they have taken advantage of the strength to create multiple renditions, each with a different theme, music etc.Cirque du Soleil originated in France in 1982 with a group of street entertainers performing for pedestrians. They proved to be so popular that new troupes were formed and finally went indoors in a circus/show format. Eventually the shows evolved into larger and larger productions, some of which could be considered extravaganzas (you don't perform Vegas with an organ grinder and a monkey).Cirque du Soleil is now internationalized with performers from all over the globe, performing all over the world and for those who cannot see a show in person there are now numerous videos, which though probably not as exciting as being there in person, actually give one a better feel for the performances, with the closeups and varying shots. And how would I describe the shows? Well I can only speak for the three videos I have seen, Dralion, Alegria and Journey of ?Man.Dralion like all Cirque du Soleil performances is a visual and audio treat. Unlike conventional circus's which utilize as many as three rings, Cirque uses only a single techno oriented ring with multi colored lighting. The sets are gorgeous and the costumes are as colorful as flowers in spring. In Dralion the singers along with the music, a form of world New Age, were so mesmerizing, that I wouldn't mind getting the sound track. The clown skits were both unusual and funny. The circus acts ranged from intricate jump roping to jaw dropping trapeze acts with much in between. It seems each act has a little different slant on what you have seen in the past. For me the most amazing acts were a juggler, named Viktor, of such unique style and expertise that it was mind boggling and a lady on her back flipping around a parasol on edge with her feet, amazing but believe me all the circus acts were imaginative and entertaining. There was one thing I didn't understand though. A couple times a giant hollow wheel was ushered out, for what I know not. It had nothing to do with any performance and was only out a minute or two and rolled back. It just seemed odd to this observer. Also the Chinese style simulated Dragons and Lions didn't play a very prominent part considering the show was named after them.CONCLUSIONBeing forced to create varied and divergent shows seems to have been a blessing. This means that audiences that have seen one version of Cirque and like it, would be likely to visit others, or as an alternative buy or rent the many videos. These videos would even be entertaining for children.This particular show/video, Dralion, obviously a melding of Dragon with Lion, was filmed in Asia and a majority of performers were Asian. This leads me to believe that, even though some members were from Canada, each troupe performs mostly in their geographical area. Hence the videos allow audiences world wide to view these wonderful shows in the intimacy of their own homes. In summary I would strongly recommend this or any Cirque video for family viewing.",5,HOW DO THEY DO IT?,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,3596,"['Dralion', 'third', 'video', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'series', 'not', 'familiar', 'Cirque', 'be', 'mergence', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'circus', 'acts', 'animals', 'floor', 'show', 'format', 'Indeed', 'two', 'versions', 'Cirque', 'shows', 'are', 'currently', 'holding', 'forth', 'showrooms', 'prominent', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Hotels', 'say', 'versions', 'what', 'are', 'play', 'can', 'be', 'replicated', 'different', 'actors', 'Cirque', 'limited', 'what', 'particular', 'performer', 'weakness', 'strength', 'Cirque', 'have', 'taken', 'advantage', 'strength', 'create', 'multiple', 'renditions', 'different', 'theme', 'music', 'etc.Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'originated', 'France', '1982', 'group', 'street', 'entertainers', 'performing', 'pedestrians', 'proved', 'be', 'so', 'popular', 'new', 'troupes', 'were', 'formed', 'finally', 'went', 'indoors', 'circus/show', 'format', 'Eventually', 'shows', 'evolved', 'larger', 'larger', 'productions', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'extravaganzas', 'do', ""n't"", 'perform', 'Vegas', 'organ', 'grinder', 'monkey', '.Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'now', 'internationalized', 'performers', 'globe', 'performing', 'world', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'show', 'person', 'are', 'now', 'numerous', 'videos', 'though', 'probably', 'not', 'as', 'exciting', 'being', 'person', 'actually', 'give', 'one', 'better', 'feel', 'performances', 'closeups', 'varying', 'shots', 'how', 'would', 'describe', 'shows', 'Well', 'can', 'only', 'speak', 'three', 'videos', 'have', 'seen', 'Dralion', 'Alegria', 'Journey', 'Man.Dralion', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'performances', 'visual', 'audio', 'treat', 'conventional', 'circus', 'utilize', 'as', 'many', 'three', 'rings', 'Cirque', 'only', 'single', 'techno', 'oriented', 'ring', 'multi', 'colored', 'lighting', 'sets', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'are', 'as', 'colorful', 'flowers', 'spring', 'Dralion', 'singers', 'music', 'form', 'world', 'New', 'Age', 'were', 'so', 'mesmerizing', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'getting', 'sound', 'track', 'clown', 'skits', 'were', 'unusual', 'funny', 'circus', 'acts', 'ranged', 'intricate', 'jump', 'roping', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'trapeze', 'acts', 'much', 'act', 'little', 'different', 'slant', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'past', 'most', 'amazing', 'acts', 'were', 'juggler', 'named', 'Viktor', 'such', 'unique', 'style', 'expertise', 'was', 'mind', 'boggling', 'lady', 'back', 'flipping', 'parasol', 'edge', 'feet', 'amazing', 'believe', 'circus', 'acts', 'were', 'imaginative', 'entertaining', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'though', 'couple', 'giant', 'hollow', 'wheel', 'was', 'ushered', 'out', 'what', 'know', 'not', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'performance', 'was', 'only', 'out', 'minute', 'two', 'rolled', 'back', 'just', 'seemed', 'odd', 'observer', 'Also', 'Chinese', 'style', 'simulated', 'Dragons', 'Lions', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'very', 'prominent', 'part', 'considering', 'show', 'was', 'named', 'them.CONCLUSIONBeing', 'forced', 'create', 'varied', 'divergent', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'blessing', 'audiences', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'version', 'Cirque', 'would', 'be', 'likely', 'visit', 'others', 'alternative', 'buy', 'rent', 'many', 'videos', 'videos', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'entertaining', 'children.This', 'particular', 'show/video', 'Dralion', 'obviously', 'melding', 'Dragon', 'Lion', 'was', 'filmed', 'Asia', 'majority', 'performers', 'were', 'Asian', 'believe', 'even', 'members', 'were', 'Canada', 'troupe', 'mostly', 'geographical', 'area', 'Hence', 'videos', 'allow', 'audiences', 'world', 'wide', 'view', 'wonderful', 'shows', 'intimacy', 'own', 'homes', 'summary', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'Cirque', 'video', 'family', 'viewing']",N/A

What started out as a few friends performing together in summer festivals blossomed into an international corporation synonymous with imagination, feats to dazzle the senses, music to astound the ears and costumes to dazzle the eyes. Cirque's motto is &quot;Invoquer l'imaginaire, provoquer les sens, &eacute;voquer l'&eacute;motion,&quot; or &quot;invoke the imagination, provoke the senses, evoke the emotions,&quot; and Dralion delivers on all these counts.Dralion is CdS's twelveth production and is a blend of East and West. The majority of the cast is Chinese, and the acts incorporate traditional Chinese circus acts with Cirque favourites. The costumes range from African to Indian to Chinese, and the lead singers &Eacute;rik Karol and Agnes Sohier represent a godlike figure, l'me Force, and as such they have the most extravagant costumes.Originally &Eacute;rik did all of the singing in Dralion but Agnes was added as the tour progressed. &Eacute;rik has since left Dralion and has been replaced by Frank Irving. The role of l'me Force was created around &Eacute;rik's unique countertenor voice, which is put to stunning effect in songs such as &quot;Stella Errans,&quot; and &quot;Hinko&quot; where he switches from head to chest voice at the drop of a hat.&quot;Ballare&quot; is a beautiful slow ballad/duet that accompanies one of the most stunning acts in Dralion: an aerial pas de deux in which the two performers are suspended from the ceiling by only a length of blue silk which they wrap around themselves. The Dralion soundtrack is also available for purchase (it is my favourite CdS soundtrack ever!) and recently won two awards from Billboard for being a top World Music album for 2001.All of the acts are sure to keep you entertained, and the bright colours and silly dralions keep kids' attentions as well. And yes, there are clowns. A new breed of clowns, evidently. In keeping with the Cirque tradition of &quot;Reinventing the Circus&quot; these clowns don't squeeze into cars. They don't wear flowers that squirt water. They do pick on audience members rather mercilessly at times, but it's part of the fun.The behind-the-scenes documentary was excellent, with lots of rehearsal footage and interviews with the composer, producer, and many of the cast. And the alternate camera angles made the show interactive! Dralion won two Emmy Awards for best show, and it's easy to see why. A fascinating fusion of world cultures.

Around 10 years ago, when the Goodwill Games came to Seattle, Cirque Du Soleil came to Seattle supporting the Novueau Experience show.  Mother said, &quot;Let's go to the circus.  It's nothing like you've seen.&quot;  I stopped at 'circus' and said, &quot;NO.&quot;  My parents went and came back.  They made me the second time.  I was floored.  What on earth was this?Then later, Saltimbanco came out and much later, I found Quidam.  Lost in the shuffle was Dralion.  For me, each show has been better than the last, each show has been more fantastic, more awesome, more bizarre.  With the exception of Alegria (a movie, not a live show), Dralion fits in quite poorly.  I was quite bored when watching this.  It doesn't hold the fun, emotion or fascination that Quidam or even the older Saltimbanco.  (And yes, I saw Saltimbanco summer 2000 and it was awesome)The show felt like it was the international version of Cirque (as if it wasn't before).  You had the African dancer doing her thing.  And while I thought it may have a more Asian feel to it, it turned out to be a B-rate version of Cirque.  There were few acts that I even liked.  Handbalancing I have always found to be really entertaining and I loved the Teeterboard performance.  And that was about it.I really should have checked it out first because it's quite a disappointment.  I admit, I compare it with Quidam.  Quidam had a wonderful story, though it was untold.  It was fun, Dralion not.  Look at the crowd in it.  They didn't look that impressed.  The hooting and hollering wasn't as loud as in the other videos.  Maybe if there was a slight story to it, it would have sucked me in better and made me more interested.The ending was pretty unspectacular.  I don't recommend this video, but rather, Quidam.  It's even by the same director, David Mallet, but what went wrong?  Why do the other angles that are available look like they are done by a high end camcorder?I don't know how soon I will send this back.  The show was very boring and I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Quidam is the one to buy for people who either love the show or you just want to show them what the Cirque world is about.
