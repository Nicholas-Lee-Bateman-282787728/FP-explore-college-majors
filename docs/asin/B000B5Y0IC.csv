It was recorded live in a German TV studio, with no audience, in 1975.  They were at their peak then both musically and in popularity.  This performance shows what made them one of the most popular bands of the 70's.  Their performance has more of a ""classic rock"" feel to it than their 1977 ""Live!"" album.  It contains their early hits plus several songs that they rarely perform anymore.  ""Moon Song"", ""California Revisted"", and ""Green Monkey"" really rock!

Nearly all the DVDs available seem to be after Dan Peek left the band, so I guess this is the reason why I bought this and still look at it from time to time.America are to me the cool easy going hippies of the 1970's with a sound that gives you a feeling of harmony - but thankfully lacks that horrible sickly syurp that Bread and Seals & Croft ooozed!  Their sound was fresh with nice harmonies, excellent guitar work and keyboards.This DVD is of real early stuff, so sadly does not have some of their best work (like Gerry Beckley's ""Sister Golden Hair"" or ""Daisy Jane""), but it does showcase the supurb talents of singer / songwriter Dewey Bunnell really well - A Horse with No Name, Sandman and Tin Man are the best tracks on the DVD.  Dan Peek adds a nice electric edge (but this was before Woman Tonight, so only features his real early stuff.)Live is a bit of a misnomer - in that it is them really jamming in what looks like a barn with a few locals sitting about, so not as good a ""live"" feel as one would expect.I love America and my main complaint is the length of the DVD (only 40 mins) and the fact that it only really features early stuff.

The band plays in nearly top form, with a minor exception in the first song which has a very brief touch of off-harmony vocals.  This, however, seems to add to the overall enjoyment this video provides.  The band plays with determined ease and craftmanship as they informally figure out the format along the way.  It makes for a refreshing antithesis to polished and lesser-dimensioned performances that often accompany programming overproduction.

Anyone can see that there are gobs of America Greatest Hits collections. Where money is to bemade people will try to get your money. That being said this really is the ONLY EXISTING DVD that is FOR SALEcommerically. There are some other glimpses of the three man band, plus musicians, on YouTube, but if you wantto see the nearly forgotten DAN PEEK playing guitar and harmonica, and singing, well, this is the cd to own.This is the lineup that formed in BRITAN. And by the way, DAN PEEK has written a book about America. It's anice pleasurable read. I highly recommend this book and Dan ALSO has his own WEBSITE [...]. I just purchasedTHREE Dan Peek cds for $15 plus tax and postage. I got Bodden Town, Driftin and a Christmas CD. The Christmas cd isa lot of fun and Bodden Town isn't bad either. I haven't heard the other cd yet.Now as for this DVD, the set up looks very similar to Saturday Night Live. The guys don't really know just whatthe producers are looking for and at one point even ask if they should repeat a song. And there is no audience, orso another reviewer stated. So, the guys are basically playing to any empty house, and as such there is no audienceenergy, tension, emotion, nothing. But even with such possible limitations the guys still play and sing quite well. And someone mentioned that ""Moon Song"" is on this set. That is a FINE song from ""Homecoming"". That song isn't evenon YouTube. It's a great Dewey Bunnel vocal. Also, Dan Peek sings ""Lonely People"". And other rarities include""Windwave"" and ""Green Monkey"" from ""Hat Trick"" and other great songs that the band rarely plays like ""Rainbow Song"", California Revisited"". Basically this is a glimpse of the band in the heyday of their fame. Thiswas when the guys were being pushed hard touring and recording. This is when three members created andplayed together. When Dan was gone it just became Dewey Bunnel and Gerry Beckley without the feedbackor perhaps criticism or critical input of the third member. A lot of diversity left when Dan left, and notthat it was all bad, nor am I trying to make Dan sound like a martyr. Dan is content and does his own thing.Dan has produced quite a bit of music. It can be hard to find. He began making Christian music first butnowadays he is much more into doing his own thing. His record label is, I think, 7 Mile Records. Anyway,this is a nice dvd. I have the audio on cd also. I had that long before I got the dvd. The audio is abootleg.1. Ventura Highway2. I Need You3. Don't Cross The River4. Horse With No Name5. Moon Song6. Lonely People7.

936428,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B000B5Y0IC,The Wingchair Critic,"[2, 2]","Both the title and cover photography for this 44-minute 'America Live' DVD are somewhat misleading, as the band only performs 'live' in the studio, and not on a genuine stage before an audience as the cover photograph suggests. Thus, the enthusiasm and energy that usually arises from the interaction between performing artists and their admirers is wholly absent, as are verbal introductions to the songs and the banter that typically takes place between performer and fan.That said, 'America Live,' which was recorded apparently sometime in 1975, captures the original members of the classic rock band executing eleven of their compositions with moderate enthusiasm, including some of their most popular hits, including 'Horse With No Name,' 'Ventura Highway,' 'Lonely People,' 'Tin Man,' and 'Don't Cross the River.' The song choice is top-heavy on Dewy Bunnell and Dan Peek songs, and, surprisingly, weak on those of Gerry Beckley, who sings lead on only one ('I Need You').As Peek passed away suddenly in July 2011 at the age of 60, 'America Live' provides fans with a valuable document of the artist at the height of his fame. Though only 25 years of age here, Peek was already an accomplished and dazzling multi-instrumentalist, an amazing vocalist, and capable of an entire range of songwriting styles, most of which 'America Live' underscores, as Peek and Bunnell seem particularly engaged in their work.However, it would be a great help if viewers were provided with the hard facts of where the film was recorded and under what circumstances the band agreed to it. At moments, it appears as if the band knows it is being recorded for posterity: Peek wears an applejack cap for one number, and dons a jacket for another, though otherwise Peek certainly doesn't appear to have dressed for the occasion.There are errors in the production: Peak's name is misspelt 'Peck,' and introductory title graphics are incomplete: 'Rainbow Song' is called 'Rainbow' and 'California Revisted,' which benefits from a nice mid-song jam session missing in the original, is titled 'California.'  The DVD package contains no 'extra' features whatsoever.Regardless, 'America Live' does capture the three original members playing together and playing well, and features wonderful clips of Peek performing 'Don't Cross the River' and an especially tender rendition of 'Lonely People' in which Peek, clearly overweight and moon-faced at the time, nonetheless resembles a shamanic mid-period Jim Morrison, though Peek's own personality and character certainly shine through.As the DVD is so brief, 'America Live' is a must for genuine, dedicated admirers of the original band at their creative height (as the band was arguably at their artistic peak in 1975) and for all fans of Dan Peek, but wholly unessential for general fans of classic American rock.",3,'Young Americans' at a Creative Crossroads,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,2838,"['title', 'cover', 'photography', '44-minute', ""'America"", 'Live', 'DVD', 'are', 'somewhat', 'misleading', 'band', 'only', ""'live"", 'studio', 'not', 'genuine', 'stage', 'audience', 'cover', 'photograph', 'Thus', 'enthusiasm', 'energy', 'usually', 'interaction', 'performing', 'artists', 'admirers', 'wholly', 'absent', 'are', 'verbal', 'introductions', 'songs', 'banter', 'typically', 'place', 'performer', 'fan.That', 'said', ""'America"", 'Live', 'was', 'recorded', 'apparently', 'sometime', '1975', 'original', 'members', 'classic', 'rock', 'band', 'executing', 'eleven', 'compositions', 'moderate', 'enthusiasm', 'including', 'most', 'popular', 'hits', 'including', 'Name', 'Highway', ""'Lonely"", 'People', 'Man', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'Cross', 'River', 'song', 'choice', 'top-heavy', 'Dewy', 'Bunnell', 'Dan', 'Peek', 'songs', 'surprisingly', 'weak', 'Gerry', 'Beckley', 'who', 'lead', 'only', 'one', 'Need', '.As', 'Peek', 'passed', 'away', 'suddenly', 'July', '2011', 'age', '60', 'Live', 'fans', 'valuable', 'document', 'artist', 'height', 'fame', 'only', '25', 'years', 'age', 'here', 'Peek', 'was', 'already', 'accomplished', 'dazzling', 'multi-instrumentalist', 'amazing', 'vocalist', 'capable', 'entire', 'range', 'songwriting', 'styles', 'most', ""'America"", 'Live', 'underscores', 'Peek', 'Bunnell', 'seem', 'particularly', 'engaged', 'work.However', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'help', 'viewers', 'were', 'provided', 'hard', 'facts', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'recorded', 'what', 'circumstances', 'band', 'agreed', 'moments', 'band', 'being', 'recorded', 'posterity', 'Peek', 'applejack', 'cap', 'one', 'number', 'jacket', 'otherwise', 'Peek', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'dressed', 'are', 'errors', 'production', 'Peak', 'name', 'misspelt', ""'Peck"", 'introductory', 'title', 'graphics', 'are', 'incomplete', ""'Rainbow"", 'Song', 'called', ""'Rainbow"", ""'California"", 'Revisted', 'benefits', 'nice', 'mid-song', 'jam', 'session', 'missing', 'original', 'titled', ""'California"", 'DVD', 'package', ""'extra"", 'features', 'whatsoever.Regardless', 'Live', 'capture', 'three', 'original', 'members', 'playing', 'together', 'playing', 'well', 'features', 'wonderful', 'clips', 'Peek', 'performing', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'Cross', 'River', 'especially', 'tender', 'rendition', ""'Lonely"", 'People', 'Peek', 'clearly', 'overweight', 'moon-faced', 'time', 'nonetheless', 'shamanic', 'mid-period', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Peek', 'own', 'personality', 'character', 'certainly', 'shine', 'DVD', 'so', 'brief', 'Live', 'must', 'genuine', 'dedicated', 'admirers', 'original', 'band', 'creative', 'height', 'band', 'was', 'arguably', 'artistic', 'peak', '1975', 'fans', 'Dan', 'Peek', 'wholly', 'unessential', 'general', 'fans', 'classic', 'American', 'rock']",N/A

It's pretty informal, with the cameras just continuously rolling as the band members switch instruments, tune guitars, sip beverages, etc. between songs.  The video is a very basic 2-camera setup, and the audio mix is also fairly simple but serviceable.  The set list is a mixture of well known hits such as ""I Need You"" and ""Tin Man,"" with a few lesser known album cuts including ""Wind Wave"" and ""Moon Song.""  With all that, this video captures the band at an historic point in time, not long before Dan Peek left the group.  Seeing him singing and playing here, it's hard not to think about how America changed with his departure.  Anyway, despite the relatively primitive recording, the guys are in great form, especially the excellent version of ""Ventura Highway"" that starts out the show.  Good vocals throughout, with only Peek sounding mildly shaky, strong playing (a couple of zesty electric guitar solos), and a solid rhythm section. The fact that the whole thing is only 43 minutes long follows from the length of the TV show, so that didn't bother me too much.  The complete lack of extras was disappointing, though, and I was also a bit annoyed by the bass being mixed too loud, especially on ""Tin Man.""
