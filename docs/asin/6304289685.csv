With the exception of two steamy scenes, it sticks to the good book with some decent interpretations added to the dialogue. Overlong at three hours, the camera shots and scene changes, nevertheless, keep it visually appealing.  Some of the battle scenes are admirable indeed.  Eric Thall and Elizabeth Hurley star in the leading roles, and while they're not Emmy or Oscar contenders, Thall's performance gathers more substance near the end of the story.  Dennis Hopper's portrayal of General Tariq isn't a career best, but he ups the quality of the acting, and Michael Gambon gives proper stature to King Hanon.

413024,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6304289685,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[45, 47]","This film includes a lot of embelishment as well as fictional characters to fill out the story of Samson, taken from Judges Ch. 13 through 16, but the essence of the story is intact. A man who loved the God of his fathers, but also the women of his enemies, the Philistines, and finds his real strength only after he has lost everything.Samson is portrayed as man who never cries, not even as a baby at his bris (circumcision), or his father's death, but the feelings of lust and revenge weave continually through his story, and there are many brutal scenes, making this film not recommended for children.As Samson's mother Mara, Diana Rigg is superb; she is a ""type,"" like Sarah/Isaac, Rachel/Jacob, Hannah/Samuel, and Elisabeth/John the Baptist, all barren women who miraculously give birth to a son that becomes a leader/savior of his people.Eric Thal is effective as Samson, very big and brawny, and he looks great on horseback. He also carries off the end parts too, which could easily have become cartoonish.Michael Gambon is terrific as the wily old King Hamun of the Philistines, and in the most bizarre casting, Dennis Hopper as a laid back general. Elizabeth Hurley's Delilah is a cool, calculating vixen, and beautiful enough to make the most of Samson's weakness. Max Von Sydow does the narration throughout the film.The Philistine interiors are very imaginitive, with their grotesque gods and massive columns, and the devastation of them well filmed. The fight with the lion is cleverly done also, with lots of grunts and roars from man and beast.Filmed on location in Quarzazate, Morocco, it has a marvelous score by Marco Frisina, the excellent cinematography of Raffaele Mertes, and well paced direction by Nicolas Roeg.""David,"" ""Solomon,"" ""Jeremiah,"" and ""Abraham"", are my favorites of these above average made for TV Bible stories, and this film, though not one of the best, is highly entertaining with some good acting.

Samson was born to a barren couple of Israel and destined to help free his people from the hand of the Philistines who had overrun their country. But Samson had a weakness and this was women.

First with his first wife and then again with Delilah.The movie, for me, moved a bit slow. I felt they spent time on aspects that they didn't need to and this bogged the movie down. The acting was ok here. I felt the direction was lacking also. I expected this movie, even for a made for TV movie, to have a lot more life and spark and it just didn't.

People who expect reading the Bible to be like going to church might have trouble figuring out Judges 15:20:  &quot;Samson was judge in Israel in the days of the Philistines for twenty years.&quot;  In the movie, Samson is more like a modern action hero.  The big joke at the beginning of the movie is the weapons of the Hebrews, made of a lesser metal than the steel swords of the Philistines.Dennis Hopper makes an interesting general for the Philistines and friend of Delilah.  Anyone who has known people like this will have no problem understanding Judges 16:13:  &quot;Then Delilah said to Samson, `Up to now you have been laughing at me and telling me lies.  Tell me what would be needed to bind you.' &quot;  The United States has been playing the Delilah part in that part of the world since the Samson stunt of the terrorists on September 11, 2001, and people who wonder mainly *whatever happened to Delilah, anyway?* might be interested in the final scenes of this movie, to see if she escapes from the building that Samson pulled down after he had been blinded and was exhibited in chains.

413027,ADES8B01WRPI3,6304289685,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[17, 22]","SAMSON AND DELILAH is 3 hours long! It has three great lead actors and a famous director, but it is greatly weakened by too much fictionalized filling-in around what the Bible says about the story.The first two hours are pretty slow, with half of it being embellishments to try to make the Scriptural details seem logical and rational to modern viewers. This is a good idea, but they leave out half of the Bible details, while trying to make plausible the half of Scripture that they do cover. They create many non-Biblical characters who help develop the history of the Israel/Philistine conflict, but I don't think it's worth the screen time that they use up, and it definitely isn't worth leaving out Bible details to make room for the fictional characters and back story.They hired Dennis Hopper for the film, but they had to create a fictional character for him to play, the Philistine General Tariq, and then they spend too much time developing Hopper's character and the fictional details that MIGHT have been going on with the bad guys. In the meantime, they don't cover all of the details in the short story from the actual Bible. They do a good job with the non-Biblical story, but it makes the first 2 hours of the movie kind of drag along.The last hour of the movie almost redeems the entire movie, as this is where a lot of the overly extensive character development finally cashes in. Unfortunately, though the last hour is emotional and logically put together, it is not really Scripturally accurate. We end up seeing what the filmmakers wrote, not necessarily what God wrote in the Bible.Early in the film, one blunder was not covering all of the angel telling Samson's parents about their unlikely son to be born to them. They show the wife being told, but then cut out the husband, Manoah, praying for the angel to return for more information, and them eating together when the angel disappears into the smoke. This would have been a fairly inexpensive scene, and it would have helped out the percentage of actual Bible content, but it did not make it into the movie. I guess their special effects budget may have been too low for the disappearance into the smoke, but it would have been easy to do all the rest of that Bible passage. They already had all of the actors on the set for it, but did not get it into the movie.They took many verses from the Samson Bible story, but shifted the chronology and smaller details around. It is not too badly done, but would have been so much stronger if they had stuck to Biblical accuracy.They show Samson fighting the lion, but doing it to save Delilah. Samson fights Philistines with a jawbone, but only a few dozen, not 1,000 as the Bible says he did. They show Samson setting the fields afire, but not with foxes tied together at the tails. They allude to Samson carrying the city gate away, but don't show it onscreen.They named the movie SAMSON AND DELILAH, but they actually end up with little onscreen time showing the two together, which surprised me.SAMSON AND DELILAH might be too mature for children, as it shows Samson hooking up with a harlot, and in bed with Delilah. There is no nudity, but their bodies are humping and bumping together, and small kids might ask what the characters are doing. If a child is too young for the birds and the bees, then you should definitely skip this movie.If you are really into Bible movies, then you may enjoy this one. But I don't recommend using it to try to witness to people who aren't already confirmed believers. It is too slow for anybody with only a casual interest in the subject matter.This is part of a line of made-for-TV Bible movies from the 1990's, from LUBE Productions, an Italian company making films for English speaking audiences. SAMSON AND DELILAH is one of the weaker films in the series, though it is still not too bad, if you are really curious to see it. The best ones in the series are ESTHER, SOLOMON and  JEREMIAH. Those three have been out for years on DVD, and are a better bargain if purchased together in THE BIBLE SERIES BOX SET. It has only been in 2005 that the rest of the series became available on DVD, though they have been available on VHS all along. The production values are very good in all the films, though they are sometimes weak in the area of supernatural events onscreen, probably due to the expense of special effects.I would recommend the DVDs of JEREMIAH, ESTHER, SOLOMON, JACOB or JOSEPH ahead of SAMSON AND DELILAH, if Bible accuracy is what you are looking for. But fans of Dennis Hopper and Elizabeth Hurley will enjoy SAMSON AND DELILAH because these two actors do a good job and get a decent amount of screen time.",3,"Great Actors, Costumes, Scenery; but

Liz Hurley, gorgeous and not given enough screen time in my opinion.  The acting was also very good.  But the script was boring.  And the only thing worse than boring, is boring and long.  They added characters and situations that did not exist in the Bible version, and which did not add anything interesting to the story.  And then they omitted situations that were in the Bible and were actually exciting. For example, when Samson burned the Philistines fields by tying flaming torches to the tails of foxes.........A potentially great scene, omitted.Some of the characters they added were long-winded and again, boring.  They did focus a great deal on his internal struggle in dealing with the calling by God to free his people, all the way from even before his birth to the very end.  And many characters were looking to him to save Gods people.  So that was actually very spiritually thought provoking.  I guess I was looking more for the exciting scenes, heroic scenes, a little more Hollywood, shall we say, and a little less Sunday School.

This movie slacks off on everything so much that the scene where he supposedly kills a thousand guys I think he probably kills five.  And he struggls against the woosy prince of Philistia.  The movie doesn't even show him taking the gate of gaza; but it sure does show the prostitutes in his life.  I said the movie slacks off on everything maybe I shouldn't have said that.

The level of the ""consummation moments"" where Samson is showed having sex with Delilah is WAY TOO detailed and down right animalistic.  Delilah is shown to picture (AND ENJOY) a great lion attacking her, in her mind, while Samson is (with music and sound to amplify the moment) over-top of her and reaching a climatic moment during their sexual intercourse.  The sexuality is overbearing for the screen, and takes the Biblical and spiritual moments completely away from the film.For thousands of years the Biblical account of Samson has been around, and the Holy Scriptures themselves tell us about Samson's sinful sexual relationship with Delilah, and we ALL GOT THE POINT from the Bible.  We didn't need God to have inspired recordings of the detailed sexual moments in order for us to understand the tensions (or the lessons!) involved.

This one falls somewhere in the middle.Samson is a child gifted with superhuman strength. He is an Israelite and his people are under the thumb of the Philistines. He is God's chosen instrument for deliverance.He would seem a strange choice. He is not exactly a pious individual. He is fairly faithful to his vows but sees nothing wrong with having a good time. This is especially true when having a good time involves a beautiful girl of the Philistines. Over time, he lets the treacherous beauty in on his secret and the result is terrible. He is deprived of that which makes him great to begin with and winds ups as a blinded slave.The redeeming quality of the story is God's ability to take an imperfect individual and use him for great purposes. Nobody is beyond the pale. That is the central message and it is well done.On the minus side, there are some non scriptural elements.

Overall, the writting is excellent, thoughtful, and enhances the Biblical narrative. Oddly, though, the writer(s) made a bold choice in this story by attempting to humanize Samson's Philistine opponents, giving them some depth as well as a touch of sympathy. No doubt this is a more honest approach than what is presented in the Bible, where the Philistines have only one role to play---that of evil enemy. However, painting Israel's hated enemy with a more realistic brush also creates unnecessary conflict for the viewer, leaving unanswered questions as to the motivations and actions of several main Philistine characters (who seem to be acting against their own interests to further the story). Rather than enhance the plot of Samson's struggle, this actually serves to weaken it in some ways.Aside from an above average script (for television), the production itself is flawed in a variety of ways. Filmed in Morrocco, the locations have that unmistakable look of the Sahara that shares nothing in common with ancient Palestine. Frankly, the sets are ugly, drab, and colorless. The casting is also a mess, with a handful of very pale-looking British and American actors surrounded by Morrocan extras: why would some Israelites and Philistines be so pale and speak crisp English, while all of their compatriots look Arabic and speak with thick accents? This obvious discrepancy detracts from the story. The costumes are well done, but nearly everything else is visually dull and shabby.Finally, having read other reviews before seeing this version, I had the impression that several scenes were just shy of soft-porn. Much has been said about the sex scenes between Samson and Delilah. It's all much-ado-about-nothing; there is zero nudity in this movie, and watching two actors lying in bed together, covered from the shoulders down, while kissing passionately does not a porno make.",3,Good script suffers from poor production,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,2038,"['enjoyed', 'version', 'Biblical', 'tale', 'though', 'other', 'reviewers', 'noted', 'shade', 'too', 'long', 'many', 'performances', 'are', 'uneven', 'best', 'Overall', 'writting', 'excellent', 'thoughtful', 'Biblical', 'narrative', 'Oddly', 'though', 'writer', 's', 'made', 'bold', 'choice', 'story', 'attempting', 'humanize', 'Samson', 'Philistine', 'opponents', 'giving', 'depth', 'as', 'well', 'touch', 'sympathy', 'doubt', 'more', 'honest', 'approach', 'what', 'presented', 'Bible', 'where', 'Philistines', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'role', 'play', 'evil', 'enemy', 'However', 'painting', 'Israel', 'hated', 'enemy', 'more', 'realistic', 'brush', 'also', 'unnecessary', 'conflict', 'viewer', 'leaving', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'motivations', 'actions', 'several', 'main', 'Philistine', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'acting', 'own', 'interests', 'further', 'story', 'Rather', 'enhance', 'plot', 'Samson', 'struggle', 'actually', 'weaken', 'ways.Aside', 'above', 'average', 'script', 'television', 'production', 'flawed', 'variety', 'ways', 'Filmed', 'Morrocco', 'locations', 'have', 'unmistakable', 'look', 'Sahara', 'shares', 'nothing', 'common', 'ancient', 'Palestine', 'Frankly', 'sets', 'are', 'ugly', 'drab', 'colorless', 'casting', 'also', 'mess', 'handful', 'very', 'pale-looking', 'British', 'American', 'actors', 'surrounded', 'Morrocan', 'extras', 'why', 'would', 'Israelites', 'Philistines', 'be', 'so', 'pale', 'speak', 'crisp', 'English', 'compatriots', 'look', 'Arabic', 'speak', 'thick', 'accents', 'obvious', 'discrepancy', 'detracts', 'story', 'costumes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'nearly', 'everything', 'else', 'visually', 'dull', 'shabby.Finally', 'having', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'seeing', 'version', 'had', 'impression', 'several', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'shy', 'soft-porn', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Samson', 'Delilah', 'much-ado-about-nothing', 'zero', 'nudity', 'movie', 'watching', 'two', 'actors', 'lying', 'bed', 'together', 'covered', 'shoulders', 'down', 'kissing', 'passionately', 'not', 'porno', 'make']",Samson & Delilah VHS

With striking set design, beautiful art direction and oftentimes alarming attention to period detail, this is pretty realistic stuff.  And pretty brutal.  A lot of this can be attributed to British art-house director Nicolas Roeg, who has made ""Samson and Delilah"" perhaps his most ambitious film to date.  At 180 minutes there is nary a dull moment.  Roeg afficianados will appreciate the customary Roeg flourishes:  shocking edits, liberal use of the zoom lens, intentional placement of humor and a general atmosphere of mysticism and otherworldliness.  The performances are all around solid.  Dennis Hopper turns in a clever and decidedly Hopper-esque performance as a reluctant Philistine general.  Eric Thall, as Samson, comes across as vulnerable and humane yet entirely believable when coerced to flights of rage.  His long hair doesn't look fake, chalking up another high mark for this film's realism.  And Elizabeth Hurley as Delilah?  Well, what more needs to be said?  She really delivers with her greedy seduction of Samson and subsequent guilt.  Not to mention, that in her Delilah garb, she is absolutely gorgeous.
