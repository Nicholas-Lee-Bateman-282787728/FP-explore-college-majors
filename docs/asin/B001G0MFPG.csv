Nor did I notice the need for use of the ""F"" word to be used every other word out of any of the actor's mouths in order for the series to be considered ""in"" by some segments of todays viewers.  (No, I'm not a prude nor does anyone I know, work with or socialize with exhibit any need to use the ""F"" word in order to carry on normal, everyday conversation).  The series consistently delivered both interesting and believable material and usually kept you on the edge of your seat wondering how either Harm or Mac was going to overcome whatever peril they might find themselves in, or how they were going to prove their client's innocence.  It was a sad day when the series ended but guess all good things must come to an end.  Would have been nice to have seen Harm and Mac actually get married though.

Although the FRiday night move could have been a death nell, JAG continued to enjoy solid ratings during this year and returned for a tenth and final season in 2004.The first episode of Season 9 begins right where the cliffhanger in Season 8 left off.  Harm, having resigned his commission, is in Paraguay with Gunney, Mac, and Webb; trying to complete their almost fatal mission.  When they return to JAG Headquarters, Harm finds out he is completely out of a job; as the admiral has filed his resignation and he is no longer needed.  During the next few episodes, Harm finds himself crop dusting and then working with the CIA until he is fired because his picture is shown on ZNN.  Admiral A.J. Chegwidden finally re-instates Harm, but only as a last resort.If those storylines won't confuse you enough, just wait until you watch Mac deal with her feelings on having to kill.....someone very important (I won't give it away in case you never got to see the show), A.J.'s romance blossom and then his sudden departure from JAG in the season's final episode.Here is a list of all 23 action packed episodes:1.
