The problem is terribly obvious: they never really knew each other in the first place before they got married. And the marriage was doomed right from the start. All the signals are there staring at their faces. All of that are what made the film to be tedious to watch. Another obvious problem, besides making her to laugh, what else is there about him? Exactly...my point. Also, the film has one too many jokes yet two out of five probably made me to laugh: too overdone. Debra Winger looks like she never believed in the film.

515111,AE12AEJFCOGGY,B00002ND79,"David Montgomery ""Book Critic""","[9, 9]","The romantic comedy is a very popular genre at the movies right now.  I suppose that it always has been.  In ""Forget Paris"" the emphasis is on the comedy, rather than the romance, and it provides a nice counterpart to some  of the others.The story is structured in a fashion that will be familiar  to Woody Allen fans.  Three couples are sitting around at dinner telling  stories about their absent friends Mickey (Billy Crystal) and Ellen (Debra  Winger).Mickey and Ellen first meet in Paris through a rather amazing  set of circumstances.  (I won't give it away.)  They fall in love, but  Mickey has to go back to work-he's an NBA referee-so he leaves.  He pines  for Ellen, though, and it starts to affect his work.  (There's a great  scene with him and Kareem Abdul Jabbar.)  Finally, Mickey returns to Paris  and they resume where they left off.Eventually, they decide to get  married and Ellen quits her job and moves to California with Mickey.  That's when the problems begin.  Mickey is constantly on the road, so Ellen  gets lonely, plus she hates her new job.  Basically, she's  miserable.Trying to make things work out between them, Mickey quits his  job and stays home with Ellen.  In the meantime, she has gotten a great job  that she loves so she's never home.  Now Mickey is miserable.If you  suspect that somehow everything works out in the end, you've probably seen  this kind of movie before.  No matter.  A romantic comedy succeeds or  fails, not based on its originality or unpredictability, but on its charm,  humor and the charisma of its characters.  On that basis, ""Forget Paris""  succeeds.Billy Crystal produced, directed and co-wrote the film, in  addition to starring in it, so it's his picture all the way.  With that  kind of pedigree, you know it's going to be funny, and it is.  Sometimes  hilariously so.It also means that there will be moments when the story  or the characters will be sacrificed in order to serve the humor-and there  are.  There are too many scenes where Crystal cracks jokes and all Winger  is given to do is laugh at them.  That's too bad.  An actress of her talent  and intelligence should have a character that is more worthy of  her.There will be natural comparisons between this film and ""When Harry  Met Sally...,"" which also starred Billy Crystal.  Although this picture is  not as good as that one, it is still enjoyable.",3,Funny Romantic Comedy,959212800,"05 25, 2000",2000,2382,"['romantic', 'comedy', 'very', 'popular', 'genre', 'movies', 'right', 'now', 'suppose', 'always', 'been', 'Forget', 'Paris', 'emphasis', 'comedy', 'rather', 'romance', 'nice', 'counterpart', 'others.The', 'story', 'structured', 'fashion', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fans', 'Three', 'couples', 'are', 'sitting', 'around', 'dinner', 'telling', 'stories', 'absent', 'friends', 'Mickey', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Ellen', 'Debra', 'Winger', '.Mickey', 'Ellen', 'first', 'Paris', 'rather', 'amazing', 'set', 'circumstances', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'fall', 'love', 'Mickey', 'go', 'back', 'work-he', 'NBA', 'referee-so', 'Ellen', 'though', 'affect', 'work', 'great', 'scene', 'Kareem', 'Abdul', 'Jabbar', 'Finally', 'Mickey', 'Paris', 'resume', 'where', 'left', 'off.Eventually', 'decide', 'get', 'married', 'Ellen', 'job', 'moves', 'California', 'Mickey', 'when', 'problems', 'begin', 'Mickey', 'constantly', 'road', 'so', 'Ellen', 'lonely', 'new', 'job', 'Basically', 'miserable.Trying', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'Mickey', 'job', 'home', 'Ellen', 'meantime', 'gotten', 'great', 'job', 'so', 'never', 'home', 'Now', 'Mickey', 'miserable.If', 'suspect', 'somehow', 'everything', 'out', 'end', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'kind', 'movie', 'matter', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fails', 'not', 'based', 'originality', 'unpredictability', 'charm', 'humor', 'charisma', 'characters', 'basis', 'Forget', 'Paris', 'succeeds.Billy', 'Crystal', 'produced', 'directed', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'addition', 'starring', 'picture', 'way', 'kind', 'pedigree', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'funny', 'Sometimes', 'hilariously', 'so.It', 'also', 'will', 'be', 'moments', 'when', 'story', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'order', 'serve', 'humor-and', 'are', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'Crystal', 'jokes', 'Winger', 'given', 'do', 'laugh', 'too', 'bad', 'actress', 'talent', 'intelligence', 'should', 'have', 'character', 'more', 'worthy', 'will', 'be', 'natural', 'comparisons', 'film', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'also', 'starred', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'picture', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'still', 'enjoyable']",Forget Paris
515112,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00002ND79,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 4]","I can see why Debra Winger went into a self-imposed exile after this tiresome 1995 studio product, as she looks ill-at-ease as a romantic comedy lead. Here is an accomplished actress who seizes roles with a palpable life force when she is in the right vehicle. However, Winger seems lost playing against the stand-up shenanigans of Billy Crystal, and consequently they never really connect in any believable way. Much of the blame has to be placed on Crystal, who not only starred but also directed and co-wrote the film with Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. He seems intent on doing a retread ofWhen Harry Met Sally...but this time following a seemingly incompatible couple through marital discord.Crystal plays Mickey Gordon, an NBA referee who tries to abide by his estranged father's wishes to be buried in France. The airline has unfortunately lost the casket, and their Paris-based customer relations executive Ellen Andrews tries to correct things for Mickey. Of course, they fall in love since it is Paris, and they get married almost immediately. Complications ensue with Mickey on the road and Ellen unable to conceive a baby. The central conceit of the film is its framing device, a dinner where a group of their friends congregate and share their remembrances of Mickey and Ellen's courtship and marital problems. How they are able to relay such intimate details is never really addressed since it's a plotting contrivance we are supposed to accept.The other problem is that Crystal is not really acting here but performing his comedy routine as Mickey. Many of his lines sound overly familiar with many of the jokes having a forced feeling, and the role is virtually interchangeable with his Harry from the earlier film. Nevertheless, there are some truly funny bits, such as the running gag with Ellen's senile father (played by a befuddled William Hickey) repeating road signs in the car and the scene with the pigeon getting stuck to the side of Ellen's head. But it's not nearly enough. A solid supporting cast has been assembled as the friends - Joe Mantegna, Julie Kavner (particularly funny), Richard Masur, Cathy Moriarty, John Spencer, Cynthia Stevenson - though they act more like a chorus to the proceedings. The inevitable ending feels hollow since the relationship never felt that resonant. Despite some attempts at serious moments during the second half, this is the type of lightweight film that doesn't linger too long in one's memory. The 2000 DVD has no extras.",2,An Unfortunate Lack of Chemistry Between an Ill-Used Winger and a Battery-Operated Crystal,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,2491,"['can', 'see', 'why', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'went', 'self-imposed', 'exile', 'tiresome', '1995', 'studio', 'product', 'ill-at-ease', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'lead', 'Here', 'accomplished', 'actress', 'who', 'roles', 'palpable', 'life', 'force', 'when', 'right', 'vehicle', 'However', 'Winger', 'lost', 'playing', 'stand-up', 'shenanigans', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'consequently', 'never', 'really', 'connect', 'believable', 'way', 'Much', 'blame', 'be', 'placed', 'Crystal', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'starred', 'also', 'directed', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'Lowell', 'Ganz', 'Babaloo', 'Mandel', 'intent', 'doing', 'retread', 'ofWhen', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'time', 'following', 'seemingly', 'incompatible', 'couple', 'marital', 'discord.Crystal', 'plays', 'Mickey', 'Gordon', 'NBA', 'referee', 'who', 'abide', 'estranged', 'father', 'wishes', 'be', 'buried', 'France', 'airline', 'unfortunately', 'lost', 'casket', 'Paris-based', 'customer', 'relations', 'executive', 'Ellen', 'Andrews', 'correct', 'things', 'Mickey', 'course', 'fall', 'love', 'Paris', 'get', 'married', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Complications', 'ensue', 'Mickey', 'road', 'Ellen', 'unable', 'conceive', 'baby', 'central', 'conceit', 'film', 'framing', 'device', 'dinner', 'where', 'group', 'friends', 'congregate', 'share', 'remembrances', 'Mickey', 'Ellen', 'courtship', 'marital', 'problems', 'How', 'are', 'able', 'relay', 'such', 'intimate', 'details', 'never', 'really', 'addressed', 'plotting', 'contrivance', 'are', 'supposed', 'accept.The', 'other', 'problem', 'Crystal', 'not', 'really', 'acting', 'here', 'performing', 'comedy', 'routine', 'Mickey', 'Many', 'lines', 'sound', 'overly', 'familiar', 'many', 'jokes', 'having', 'forced', 'feeling', 'role', 'virtually', 'interchangeable', 'Harry', 'earlier', 'film', 'Nevertheless', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'bits', 'such', 'running', 'gag', 'Ellen', 'senile', 'father', 'played', 'befuddled', 'William', 'Hickey', 'repeating', 'road', 'signs', 'car', 'scene', 'pigeon', 'getting', 'stuck', 'side', 'Ellen', 'head', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'A', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'been', 'assembled', 'friends', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'Julie', 'Kavner', 'particularly', 'funny', 'Richard', 'Masur', 'Cathy', 'Moriarty', 'John', 'Spencer', 'Cynthia', 'Stevenson', 'act', 'more', 'chorus', 'proceedings', 'inevitable', 'ending', 'feels', 'hollow', 'relationship', 'never', 'felt', 'resonant', 'attempts', 'serious', 'moments', 'second', 'half', 'type', 'lightweight', 'film', ""n't"", 'linger', 'too', 'long', 'one', 'memory', '2000', 'DVD', 'extras']",Forget Paris

And how badly you want to be married.The location issue is one issue that I think brings many couples apart. So I was happy to see how they addressed this problem in a movie.BILLY CRYSTALPlease don't throw tomatoes at me. He's not my favorite actor, especially because he plays the same person in every movie. He's always the sarcastic, goofy guy. But he's okay. Only thing that really annoys me is how he never seems to have a haircut in any of his movies. He has this 1 inch of frizzy fuzz hair. And he is always wearing the tightest jeans! And most of the time its not believable that these gorgeous ladies would be attracted to him at all.DEBRA WINGERShe was ok. But she lacked the charm and charisma of Meg Ryan. I found her character a little flat. Which is not her fault. She did what she could.THE REFEREEIt was annoying to have Billy Crystal be a referee.

Unfortunately, while there love endures, that Parisian spark doesn't survive the wedding.

She may have to bear the obvious unhappiness of causing Mickey to lose his dream job, not to mention his loutish friends, including Joe Mantegna as a sportswriter, and primetime TV vet John Spencer (""LA Law"", ""West Wing"") as a serial divorcee who derisively refers to his latest spouse as ""the new Mrs. Jack.""If ""Paris"" is uneven it's because it's trying to be a romantic comedy that is often not very romantic or that funny.

515136,A2Q8GFSEUSGJ51,B00002ND79,S. WIlliams,"[0, 0]","To my mind, this is one of the most under-rated romantic comedies of all time. My husband and I had both seen this at one point (I saw it at the theater) and weren't blown away. (Liked it, didn't love it.) And, then, shortly after we started dating, saw part of it on TV together and realized how truly funny it was. A few years into our marriage we started a tradition that we watched ""Forget Paris"" together every year on our anniversary, and we still do (if not on, then near). It's become one of those classic films for us, where we can just say a line and crack each other up.Billy Crystal is an unlikely romantic lead, but it works here. Joe Mantegna, Debra Winger, Julie Kavner (a.k.a. Marge Simpson), the late, great John Spencer and the always wonderful Cathy Moriarity (when is she not brilliant?) round out a truly awesome cast.The story of a couple that meet, fall in love, break up, make up, and do it all over again (many more times)--all in very funny, yet real ways--never fails to delight. (And it's all told in flashback by friends waiting at a restaurant.)I've given this film to several people as gifts (most haven't even heard of it) and they've all enjoyed it. It's very much in the vein of ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and other not-starring-teenagers fun, romantic films--though I actually think ""Forget Paris"" is more romantic and far funnier than ""Sleepless"" could ever hope to be. (And please don't confuse it with the dreadful, Meg Ryan flop, ""French Kiss."") I truly have no idea why this isn't a classic of its genre.
