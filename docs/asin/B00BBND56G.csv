Let me explain what I mean here.These tapes are the very first ones featuring THX from Industrial Light and Magic.  Before this set was released, THX was only available in movie theaters.  After these tapes were released, THX has become featured on both VHS and DVD.The thing that these tapes are the last of is the original theatrical release of Star Wars Episodes 4, 5 and 6.  After 1995 when these tapes were released, the Star Wars Special Edition of the movies came out.  When the Special Editions of the movies came out, it was goodbye to the original movies for the most part.  Those of you who own this and the Special Edition version know what I mean.If you want to own and see the original Star Wars movies as they first appeared in the theaters, these videotapes are the only way to do so.",5,The Star Wars Trilogy . . .

It's quality and sound may be absolutely nothing to the new ""updated"" releases, but it sure is nice to see them as they were shown theatrically back in the day. No edits, enhancements or added scenes...just the same, original Star Wars that we grew up with. If you still own a VHS player and want to own Star Wars ""as it was"", then this is your only real option.
