Nancy Robertson & Brent Butt have again produced a wonderful product for adults & kids alike, my 12 year old son almost fell off the couch he was laughing so hard.

The lines aren't that funny.  And Nancy R. seems out of place in her role.  Brent, c'mon....you can do better than this!  Brent's wife in the series is cute, but not believable as a spouse nor a gardener for that matter.  Her accent distracts from who she is supposed to be..not that an accent is bad, but her acting isn't all that keen either.  The show has it's cute moments, but overall, if it doesn't get much better, with great comedic timing and talent like ""Corner Gas"", then I can't continue watching.  :(",2,"Okay, but not up to Corner Gas standard",1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,630,"['was', 'so', 'happy', 'when', 'Brent', 'Butt', 'came', 'out', 'show', 'then', 'purchased', 'watched', 'acting', 'forced', 'lines', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Nancy', 'R.', 'place', 'role', 'Brent', ""c'mon"", '.you', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'Brent', 'wife', 'series', 'cute', 'not', 'believable', 'spouse', 'gardener', 'matter', 'accent', 'distracts', 'who', 'supposed', 'be..not', 'accent', 'bad', 'acting', ""n't"", 'keen', 'show', 'cute', 'moments', 'overall', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'talent', 'Corner', 'Gas', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'continue', 'watching']",N/A

1419558,A5ZD7E0GQ53CU,B004LXI42I,LuAnne D,"[0, 0]","Delightful and funny. Canadian television shines again.  Nancy Robertson plays Millie Upton, a successful children's book author. She sees the world as a child.  She overacts to difficult situations with what her editor calls hiccups, these hiccups inspire her books. To deal with her hiccups she hires a life coach, Stan (Brent Butt), who has no formal training has his hands full trying to defuse her hiccups and help her understand them and why she reacts the way she does. Her overreactions are how most of us wish we could say or do. Nancy Robertson is as wonderful as she was in Corner Gas. Kudos to the writers on creativity and freshness and not relying on vulgar offensive language, violence and nudity to tell a story.
