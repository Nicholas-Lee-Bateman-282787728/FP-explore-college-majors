1117345,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000YABYLA,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[4, 12]","Warm, smart, and funny `Juno' is a sympathetic look at teen pregnancy.  Starting out during her consummation, the titled character (Ellen Page) shares the details of her infatuation with high school track star, Paulie Bleaker (Michael Cera, `Superbad'), takes it to her discovery of pregnancy (in the presence of a convenience store clerk, played acerbically by Rainn Wilson) until she follows through her decision resolving her ""problem"".Enthusiastic, but trying not to care so she won't get hurt, Juno comes across her pregnancy flippantly as a minor inconvenience.  Juno is named after Zeus's wife (technically Jupiter, but Hera's name wouldn't fit).  Her father named her as a self-fulfilling prophecy of her natural beauty.  Her dad (J.K. Simmons, Spiderman 3') is ex-military.  He's divorced, but married to a born-again Christian, whom he's found stability for ten years.  Her best friend, Ellen, is the only one on whom she confides, and her boyfriend is someone she hasn't quite locked down in her emotions.Juno knows her choices.  She is as innocent and nave as she is knowledgeable about what she could do with her baby.  Discerning what's given to her, she decides to have the baby and give it up for adoption.  She finds her potential couple in an advertisement flyer, but once her decision is made, she has to let her father and step-mother know.Much of the movie shows a perky Juno discovering the trek of her pregnancy.  The movie has such a natural tone and delivery from its characters, they seem like people we all know.  Juno gets to know the adopting couple from St. Cloud, MN, a relatively short trek from her own Twin Cities suburban home.  The film makes discoveries about her relationship to Paulie Bleaker and the details of the adopting couple (Here Jason Bateman's appearance brings a real time warp to the picture.) that seem organic and natural.  Ellen Page is so good with her role that I wouldn't leave out the possibility of an Oscar nomination.  Her range of emotions is good; the discoveries her character makes are believable; and her witty, fast-pitch lines are blurt-out funny.  Everyone else is identifiably genuine as well.While the old fashioned paradigm of the nursery rhyme comes leaping to mind, ""First comes love, then comes marriage, then come..someone...in the baby carriage,"" real life, especially today, is often not like that.  Without much maliciousness--except for what normally comes to us--`Juno' leaves a lingering sweetness that isn't artificially enhanced.",4,Naturally Sweet and Sage,1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,2513,"['Warm', 'smart', 'funny', 'Juno', 'sympathetic', 'look', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'Starting', 'out', 'consummation', 'titled', 'character', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'shares', 'details', 'infatuation', 'high', 'school', 'track', 'star', 'Paulie', 'Bleaker', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Superbad', 'discovery', 'pregnancy', 'presence', 'convenience', 'store', 'clerk', 'played', 'acerbically', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'decision', 'resolving', 'problem', '.Enthusiastic', 'trying', 'not', 'care', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'hurt', 'Juno', 'pregnancy', 'flippantly', 'minor', 'inconvenience', 'Juno', 'named', 'Zeus', 'wife', 'technically', 'Jupiter', 'Hera', 'name', 'would', ""n't"", 'fit', 'father', 'named', 'self-fulfilling', 'prophecy', 'natural', 'beauty', 'dad', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Spiderman', '3', 'ex-military', 'divorced', 'married', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'whom', 'found', 'stability', 'ten', 'years', 'best', 'friend', 'Ellen', 'only', 'one', 'whom', 'boyfriend', 'someone', ""n't"", 'quite', 'locked', 'down', 'emotions.Juno', 'choices', 'innocent', 'nave', 'knowledgeable', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'baby', 'Discerning', 'what', 'given', 'have', 'baby', 'give', 'up', 'adoption', 'potential', 'couple', 'advertisement', 'flyer', 'once', 'decision', 'made', 'let', 'father', 'step-mother', 'know.Much', 'movie', 'perky', 'Juno', 'discovering', 'trek', 'pregnancy', 'movie', 'natural', 'tone', 'delivery', 'characters', 'seem', 'people', 'know', 'Juno', 'know', 'adopting', 'couple', 'St', 'Cloud', 'MN', 'relatively', 'short', 'trek', 'own', 'Twin', 'Cities', 'suburban', 'home', 'film', 'discoveries', 'relationship', 'Paulie', 'Bleaker', 'details', 'adopting', 'couple', 'Here', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'appearance', 'real', 'time', 'warp', 'picture', 'seem', 'organic', 'natural', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'so', 'good', 'role', 'would', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'possibility', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'range', 'emotions', 'good', 'discoveries', 'character', 'are', 'believable', 'witty', 'fast-pitch', 'lines', 'are', 'blurt-out', 'funny', 'Everyone', 'else', 'identifiably', 'genuine', 'old', 'fashioned', 'paradigm', 'nursery', 'rhyme', 'leaping', 'mind', 'First', 'love', 'then', 'marriage', 'then', 'come..someone', 'baby', 'carriage', 'real', 'life', 'especially', 'today', 'often', 'not', 'much', 'maliciousness', 'what', 'normally', 'Juno', 'lingering', 'sweetness', ""n't"", 'artificially', 'enhanced']",Juno

1117353,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000YABYLA,Alistair McHarg,"[47, 64]","Film focus groups, an abomination, have been around a long time.  This is where creative integrity is swapped out for box office bank-ability, assuming there was any there to begin with.  Various different endings and permutations of all types are tried out on a small handful of people in the dark.  Then, movies are trimmed and tailored to suit their tastes.  (Originality stands little chance.)  Well, apparently there are now Sundance focus groups.  How else could one explain the popularity of Juno, a movie whose sole purpose in life seems to be pleasing the smug, self-consciously hip judges at that increasingly less independent film festival.In this case affixing blame is easy, it belongs in its entirety to Diablo Cody who wrote the screenplay.  In the history of film has there ever been a character as improbable as Juno MacGuff?  Has there ever been a story more stupid, or confused about what it wants to say?  Juno begins as a surly, edgy, dark outcast and ends up just shy of the yearbook committee.  Her glib, sarcastic persona must have seemed delicious to those cool cats at Sundance, but the way adults buy into her dismissive attitude is preposterous.  Only the ultrasound technician, (Kaaren de Ziva), speaks to her and her ilk as they should be addressed, irresponsible and vulgar children.  The inevitable 3rd act reconciliations, emotional growth spurts, and newfound harmonies are beyond hokey and facile, and as for Paulie, the boyfriend she now loves, I have encountered loaves of Wonderbread with more personality.  We are supposed to buy that she has anything in common with him?Director Jason Reitman and a wonderful cast are to be heartily congratulated for transforming this three-legged duckbilled platypus into something resembling a movie.  Ellen Page really is remarkable as Juno; she takes a character more ludicrous than Batman and makes her seem real.  Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons, two reliable veterans, are extremely good as mom and dad.  Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are just acceptable as the prospective adopters.  I don't know if Michael Cera, Paulie, is good or not.  If he was intended to be completely vapid, uninteresting, and unattractive, then perhaps he's good.If you have any doubts about how bad this movie actually is, watch Little Miss Sunshine again.  Both films want to hit the same marks, Sunshine hits them, Juno self-consciously attempts to hit them.  It's like watching a couple dance; except they're following the footprints in an Arthur Murray Dance Studio.  Speaking of which, beware of the score featuring songs by Kimya Dawson.  Never has so much precious, pretentious, cutesy-poo teenage angst been packed into such a short amount of time - unbearable.",2,"Juno?

I am rating it a five because although slightly unconventional it really did work.The dialogue is at times smart, but most importantly it gives depth to its characters.Juno's character is not main stream or linear at all- she is smart, rebellious, independent and happy to be an outcast. She is also mature for a 16 year old, though she doesn't seem to think so. She becomes pregnant at 16 and well the film is basically about how she confronts and deals with her problem. Her solution- not typical Hollywood at all. Thus, why it originated as an independent film- great writing.There is Paulie, a loser (not necessarily in the bad sense- he is very sweet) by most people's standards and the unborns daddy. You don't see much of him but when he is on screen its basically to build on the dynamic of the relationship that he has with Juno. Once more the ending, how things end up is in a sense not conventional for Hollywood, in another typical Hollywood- but hey we love that sort of stuff.Vanessa and Mark are pretty standard characters but their relationship (they are husband and wife) takes a twist.Bren and Mac are the loving and supportive parents (one is a step parent) of Juno.The film is smart and well written.

1117357,AIPSUF99BQ17T,B000YABYLA,Amazon.com-lover,"[14, 18]","but not me.Ellen Page was reasonably good but a basically one note quirky character, with the most ridiculous unbelievable words coming out of her 16 yr old mouth, though granted, I would rather have heard more of those strange phrases instead of the inevitable "" totally"" and ""like"" that she and her blonde friend used way too much throughout. From wacky to banal, it seemed way too forced.Juno's robotic quirkiness ( and I mean the character not the actress)  continued pretty much throughout the movie ( except for below mentioned van scene).I did like Jennifer Garner, she conveyed desperation and longing that was very sweet and real. But I found it completely impossible to connect or believe in any of the other characters or the story line, starting with the 1st scene where Juno is on the lawn looking at the recliner chair. Later, her friend has to help her move the chair to Juno's van, but then somehow Juno was able to pull the chair out of the van and set it up by her little self on the boyfriend's lawn along with the rug and living room accessories ( not to mention the pipe? Uh.. why?). Why did she do that? How did she do that by herself? Just an example of oh-so-lets be quirky but just not engaging.And wait! for a supposedly smart girl who took health classes ( she refers to the health class) , it was not believable that she would not have used condoms or foam or some kind of protection. It did not fit with the smart ( although unbelievable) worldliness of the character. It wasn't as if there was an unstoppable heat of passion and she lost her head... it was clear that she was the instigator ( which I am not against, but it just was not believable)And the unfortunate music chosen...

1117360,A1PQK9OTGHDY08,B000YABYLA,Ana_y_lat,"[12, 18]","An outrageously unfunny comedy that tries way too hard to think outside the box.  I literally did not crack a smile the entire movie.  Yes, a few lines were perhaps amusing, but definitely not laugh-out-loud funny, and simply not enough of them to make this a good comedy in my book.I found it to be a really bad movie all around: the story is not plausible, the characters are not believable, the dialogue was horrific, and I did not much care for the soundtrack.  Now, the acting was not bad (I actually walked away from this movie respecting Jennifer Gardner as an actress for the first time), but that is not enough to save the movie.I have to agree  whole-heartedly with all the reviewers who stressed that the movie has horrible, HORRIBLE dialogue.  It seems they tried so hard to make every line provocative and edgy, they ended up sucking every ounce of life and credibility out of them, for the sake of quirkiness.The plot of the movie felt half-baked in its unexplained contradictions:1.  Like many other reviewers said, Juno sounds like she's 30.  How does a girl that mature, who knew so much about abortion clinics, who did not have any religious imperatives not to use contraception, who did NOT have sex in the throws of the passion, etc. not think to use a condom, to begin with?  I just don't buy it.  And this undermines the entire premise.2.  Juno discusses peeing on a stick with a convenience store clerk (in a small town!), with a somewhat hostile clerk at that, in the presence of others, as well, and then, at some point, she complains that she is the target of looks and gossip at school?  This does not seem to compute.  Either she's such a free spirit, or so out of touch with reality, that she does not care, in which case, she should not care about the rumors, either (and I understand that teens can be cruel and could get even to such an aloof person, but we see no real nastiness going on in the movie).  And if she does care about her reputation at school, has she considered not waving the stick in people's faces?  If she cares, would she really want everyone to know that she had a pregnancy scare, if it turns out to be a false alarm?3.  There was 0 chemistry between Juno and her ""love"".  He had the appeal of a half-dried jellyfish in the movie.  Their relationship was not at all well penned, I felt not progression, no eye-opening moments, nothing.  Sure, not all love is at first sight, and sometimes you do realize that you're in love with someone who's been around for ages, but in that case, it'd be nice to at least get a glimpse of why this guy is great for this girl, and we get next to nothing to work with here.4.  There WAS relatively believable chemistry between her and the adoptive father.  However, it really annoyed me that when she discovered he was going to get a divorce, she was SHOCKED, even though she was slow-dancing with him and putting her head on his chest as he was revealing it, and she came over to begin with knowing full well he'd be home and his working wife would be away.  And she can't even claim being oblivious, because her stepmother spelled it out for her earlier.5.  In front of the abortion clinic, Juno tells her classmate of a girl, who OD-ed on her meds and lost it at the mall pool.  The classmate responds by saying ""I heard that was you"".  So, Juno has a major depression problem, but that is the first and last time we hear of it.  Why even mention it, if you will just wave it away later?I could nitpick more, but these are, in my opinion, crucial points, and they all were unrealistic, unexplained, or underdeveloped.While I actually liked the characters of her Dad and step Mom, I found their reaction utterly unrealistic.  While it could be refreshing to have an alternative to the mandatory freak-out session that usually ensues after such an announcement in other movies, no amount of leniency, open-mindednes, and hipness can vaccinate you against this game-changer.  Even if you do not intend to disown your daughter, and are ready to back her, no matter what she decides to do, it is STILL a health risk (especially for a clinically depressed teen!), a potential detriment to education, a financial burden on everyone in the family, etc.  So, I feel like the movie went too far in trying to downplay the gravity of the situation.Same goes for the best friend.  We hardly know why they are best friends, and I do believe that the best friend was supposed to be a cheerleader, and yet, she hangs out with an ""outcast"" (and don't even get me started on Hollywood repeatedly attempting to convince us that beautiful smart girls can't fit in), sticks with her through the entire pregnancy, when others, supposedly, avoid her, AND joyously and actively participates in the birthing of Juno's child!  Are there friends like that, at 16?  Perhaps, I hope so.  But it's just one perfect character too many.I rarely feel compelled to write a movie review, because, unlike a Kindle or some other tangible object, what works and what does not is not always something verifiable and reproducible, or even ""explainable"".  Still, more often than not, I can recognize the merits of a movie even when I don't like it.  This movie was just so far removed from what I expected based on the hype, that I decided to add my two cents in support of those who found the movie weak and undeserving of the praise (and I found out here - an Oscar for the screen play???  really???).",1,"Quirkiness for the sake of quirkiness, from the title to the credits",1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,5453,"['outrageously', 'unfunny',

1117361,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000YABYLA,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","`Juno' at times comes off a little `too' abrasive.  Diablo Cody's script, which has been lauded as new-age perfection, can in moments come across forced and just a little `too' eccentric.  You may find yourself wondering if anyone really talks like this.  That said; the movie is so genuinely sweet and movie that it's easily forgivable.  In fact it's not a bad script; it's funny, witty and fresh, completely original; it's just a little `too much' at times.  That is the one and only complaint I have with this movie.  There is nothing else within this film that warrants another bad word from me.  The performances are sincere and touching, the plot is brilliantly constructed and the overall feeling of emotional connection I had in the close of this film was unexpected but joyously welcomed.  `Juno' is a great film.Here's why.The biggest plus this movie has it its fantastic cast who all commit wholeheartedly to the task at hand.  Everyone in this film is on point and that is not just a huge feat but a critical steeple for the films success.  When you think about the `witty' script filled to the brim with teenage lingo for the next generation it's some tough dialog to spurt and make believable.  The actors had a hefty assignment set before them.  If they didn't slip into character perfectly and fluently deliver their lines the film would have been a total loss.  It would have been choppy and awkward and a complete mess.  Delivering those lines fluently on the other hand would have taken a lot of work; and work they must have because not one actor failed to be convincing.  Everyone, and I stress the word `everyone', delivered magnificently.  It's the only way the script would have worked.The story follows young Juno MacGuff, a young teenage girl who finds out that she is pregnant (all thanks to that wonderful, blessed chair).  She decides against abortion and for adoption and so she searches to find the perfect family for her little sea monkey.  Those perfect parents wind up being Mark and Vanessa Loring.  It's apparent to the viewer that their relationship is not so perfect, but that's beside the point.  Juno thus decides that there is no other couple she would rather raise her baby and so with everything settled we now must wait, as do they, for the baby to come.  Waiting alongside Juno are her father Mac, her step-mother Bren and her baby-daddy Paulie.`Juno' is not your typical teen comedy for it actually delves deep into the workings of the characters it presents and helps us get inside their heads, know them and become a part of their story.  Juno is more than just another pregnant teenager to us.  Thanks to Ellen Page's Oscar nominated performance (so happy for her) Juno becomes a real person, with problems and issues and frustrations just like the rest of us.  Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are both fantastic as Vanessa and Mark, especially Garner who adds layers to her character, layers I didn't know Garner could deliver.  Michael Cera is just blowing up this year, and here as Paulie Bleeker he manages to make geek sheik.  J.K. Simmons is great as Mac and Allison Janney is flawless as Bren, utterly flawless.Like I said, there are times when `Juno' seems like it may be trying too hard but it's such a sentimental and sweet film that by the time the credits begin to roll you'll have forgiven it its minor trespasses and embraced it for the critical darling it's already become.",4,There's no denying this film has charm...,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,3439,"['Juno', 'times', 'off', 'little', 'too', 'abrasive', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'script', 'been', 'lauded', 'new-age', 'perfection', 'can', 'moments', 'come', 'forced', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'eccentric', 'may', 'find', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'really', 'talks', 'said', 'movie', 'so', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'movie', 'easily', 'forgivable', 'fact', 'not', 'bad', 'script', 'funny', 'witty', 'fresh', 'completely', 'original', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'times', 'one', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'movie', 'nothing', 'else', 'film', 'warrants', 'bad', 'word', 'performances', 'are', 'sincere', 'touching', 'plot', 'brilliantly', 'constructed', 'overall', 'feeling', 'emotional', 'connection', 'had', 'close', 'film', 'was', 'unexpected', 'joyously', 'welcomed', 'Juno', 'great', 'film.Here', 'why.The', 'biggest', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'who', 'commit', 'wholeheartedly', 'task', 'hand', 'Everyone', 'film', 'point', 'not', 'just', 'huge', 'feat', 'critical', 'steeple', 'films', 'success', 'When', 'think', 'witty', 'script', 'filled', 'brim', 'teenage', 'lingo', 'next', 'generation', 'tough', 'dialog', 'spurt', 'make', 'believable', 'actors', 'had', 'hefty', 'assignment', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'slip', 'character', 'perfectly', 'fluently', 'deliver', 'lines', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'total', 'loss', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'choppy', 'awkward', 'complete', 'mess', 'Delivering', 'lines', 'fluently', 'other', 'hand', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'lot', 'work', 'work', 'must', 'have', 'not', 'one', 'actor', 'failed', 'be', 'convincing', 'Everyone', 'stress', 'word', 'everyone', 'delivered', 'magnificently', 'only', 'way', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'worked.The', 'story', 'young', 'Juno', 'MacGuff', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'out', 'pregnant', 'thanks', 'wonderful', 'blessed', 'chair', 'abortion', 'adoption', 'so', 'find', 'perfect', 'family', 'little', 'sea', 'monkey', 'perfect', 'parents', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'Mark', 'Vanessa', 'Loring', 'apparent', 'viewer', 'relationship', 'not', 'so', 'perfect', 'beside', 'point', 'Juno', 'thus', 'other', 'couple', 'would', 'rather', 'raise', 'baby', 'so', 'everything', 'settled', 'now', 'must', 'wait', 'do', 'baby', 'come', 'Waiting', 'Juno', 'are', 'father', 'Mac', 'step-mother', 'Bren', 'baby-daddy', 'Paulie.', 'Juno', 'not', 'typical', 'teen', 'comedy', 'actually', 'deep', 'workings', 'characters', 'get', 'heads', 'know', 'become', 'part', 'story', 'Juno', 'more', 'just', 'pregnant', 'teenager', 'Thanks', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'so', 'happy', 'Juno', 'real', 'person', 'problems', 'issues', 'frustrations', 'just', 'rest', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Vanessa', 'Mark', 'especially', 'Garner', 'who', 'layers', 'character', 'layers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Garner', 'could', 'deliver', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'just', 'blowing', 'up', 'year', 'here', 'Paulie', 'Bleeker', 'make', 'geek', 'sheik', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'great', 'Mac', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'flawless', 'Bren', 'utterly', 'flawless.Like', 'said', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Juno', 'may', 'be', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'such', 'sentimental', 'sweet', 'film', 'time', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll', ""'ll"", 'have', 'forgiven', 'minor', 'trespasses', 'embraced', 'critical', 'darling', 'already', 'become']",Juno
1117362,A38PC1H0VW52V4,B000YABYLA,Andy Meneses,"[2, 2]","Juno is a very good, unique story and one of my favorite movies of the year. If you ask me (and in a sense you are.) the real star of this film is the script. Written by first time screenwriter Diablo Cody, Juno really is as they say ""this year's little miss sunshine"" It's refreshingly original, quirky and funny. It is also very heartwarming...but only towards the end. Through the majority of the film, like little miss sunshine, things pretty much get worse for the protagonists as time goes on but it is certainly not without laughs throughout. Besides, that is what makes the ending all the more powerful.The thing that struck me the most was the honesty in the dialogue. It certainly isn't completely realistic and Juno and her friend have more witty things to say then is probably natural but nonetheless, the dialogue in the film is probably more realistic than most. The film's acting is also something of note. Ellen Page, who was nominated for an Oscar for her role, delivers a great performance. In addition, the other actors in the film, such as Michael Cera and Jason Bateman also give good performances. Like his other roles, Michael Cera who plays Juno's love interest (more or less), plays awkward better than any actor I have seen.

I thought either this movie is going to be bad, or there are a lot of people who want to slam this movie. I was shocked to find out this movie was bad.First, it is nothing special in terms of performance or script. Juno is the story of a teen girl who gets pregnant. And has the most fun pregnancy ever. Her parents are all ok with her pregnancy, and she even finds a yuppy family to take the baby. Juno herself never seems to deal with the ramifications. One scene after giving birth with a few tears, you can't tell if she is emotional from drugs or what.But for me there were real man disliking problems littered in the script. They come mostly with the yuppie couple set to adopt the baby. Marc, the husband, is almost confined to a room in his mansion and lives in fear of his wife Vanessa. Vanessa, you see, wants to have a baby and although its clear to anyone that Marc isn't on board with this and is living like a battered husband (hiding from his wife)-- both Juno, Vanessa, and the movie get upset when he dares say what he wants (which isn't want Juno and Vanessa want) and goes for it. They say things like *grow up* but Marc is the only grown up and proves it by standing up and leaving his sham of a marriage before adopting a baby. Vanessa struck me as very shallow and perhaps married Marc not for love, but to have baby. Yet the movie makes Marc the bad guy. It seems apparent that Vanessa knows the marriage is in trouble but will put up with it for fear she won't get a baby without a husband. Juno knows too but wants her child to have the perfect family.Then Juno's behavior toward her boyfriend is horrible. First she tell him she is getting an abortion and then she barely talks to him. Finally when he asks someone to the prom, she gets jealous and says she is in love with him. That is how the movie ends -- they are so *in love* but please as Marc says at one point in this move to Juno... ""you are so young."" It is hard for an adult viewer to get the all warm and fuzzies about Juno's love discovery. You get the feeling that if her boyfriend (and father of her son) tells her he likes band X -- the relationship will be over.Mostly it was a boring 90 minutes. I guess someone in Hollywood who is powerful must have produced this movie because it is not good. To even compare it to election... I don't get it.

Then, it came out, did surprisingly well at the box office, and the reviews were thru the roof. Not just reviews, but word of mouth was catching on and it was strong and it was growing. I finally ended up seeing the movie, and I am so glad I did. It was such a wonderful experience. Very rarely do I catch on to these little films, nor do I jump on the bandwagon whenever the critics fall all over themselves. But this time, I'm glad I did.Juno(Ellen Page)is a 16 year old high schooler who finds out that she is pregnant. The father?. Her friend Beeker(Michael Cera, from ""Arrested Development and ""Superbad""). At first, Juno just plans on having an abortion, but decides to have the baby and give to a deserving couple. She ends up finding the seemingly perfect couple(played by the great Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, another ""Arrested Development"" alumni), but things are not always easy for Juno.The script, by newcomer Diablo Cody, is a little uncertain when the firm first starts. The first few minutes of the movie, where we are instantly pushed into Juno's world, felt a little forced and in your face. We are so imeediatley thrown into this universe, that the language and the way she speaks seemed a bit much. It was as if they were saying ""Ha ha, listen to our hip and edgey dialogue. Aren't we clever?"". Thankfully, it doesn't take long for you to get settled in Juno's world, and the dialogue and way of speaking really comes into it's own, and it is brilliant and absolutely hysterical. For a newcomer, Diablo Cody has a real future as a screenwriter. Her script really found itself and quick. It stayed tru to itself and it's characters, and made them all real and believeable people.The cast and performances here are all wonderful. Ellen Page is a star. There is no question. She comes out of nowhere, carries this little movie on her own, and just shoots it out of the park. She is wise beyond her years and, at 20, really seems like a 16 year old girl. There are people in their 20's playing high schoolers, and it just doesn't work. She pulls it off. She so rightfully deserved her Golden Globe nomination, and she certainly deserves her more recent Oscar nomination. Elsewhere, Allison Janney and JK Simmons plays her parents. They are real and honest people. They look like they could be your parents. Janney shines, and Simmons is a standout. Jennifer Garner is brilliant in her role of Vanessa. She really had some hard and interesting places to go with her character, and she was just so wonderful. You felt for her. You really did. And Jason Bateman?. I've always liked him, and he is so well suited here. His scenes alone with Page are wonderful. The rest of the supporting cast all shine, and just make the movie.""Juno"" is a rare comedy that is actually gut busting funny, but has real people in real, honest situations, that all rings true. The audience I saw it with were howling and having a good time. You believe this movie and it's characters, and that helps it.

1117378,A2XFA2HIIKS5G2,B000YABYLA,Bentley,"[9, 11]","I read somewhere that in ancient times, a woman's soul or a window into her thoughts was called ""juno"". There was also a separate masculine word for the same thing.The movie JUNO seems to give us a glimpse or a window into the thoughts and soul of our young 16 year old protagonist. In fact, in the movie, Juno discusses how her father was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology at the time she was born.As a movie viewer, I have to admit that I felt that I was indeed looking into the mind, soul and heart of this young girl who faces a pregnancy she wasn't counting on. Ellen Page does a tremendous job with the lead character of Juno MacGuff. There are moments when the language is a bit quirky like some other reviewers noticed; but you overcome this because of the depth and the soul of the performances. Michael Cera is magnificent as Paulie and is perfectly lovable in his portrayal of the ill prepared, ill equipped young father.Though I loved Cera's and Page's performances, the movie does deal with teen age pregnancy, discussion of abortion, has some sexual scenes and some other segments which a parent may or may not want their family to view. I believe in fairness to the film that all of the above was handled incredibly well.Despite the above and maybe because of the expert handling of some very sensitive subjects, Jason Reitman hits a home run with his second feature film. It is a stunner and definately the standout that critics say it is. Deserving a lot of the credit is Diablo Cody who really is the creative mind behind the story itself.Recommended as a wonky, dorky, quirky experience of family values both good and bad.

1117382,A13C072YCYHT62,B000YABYLA,B. Gordon,"[6, 8]","I first heard about Juno when I read about its popularity at the 2007 Toronto Film Festival. The story, upon first read, about a smart-ass teenager who finds herself pregnant and faced with the challenge of how to handle it, did not impress me. It wasn't a storyline that captivated my imagination or my intellectual curiosity. So I wondered. Why did this film keep receiving adulation from just about every movie reviewer under the sun? Rotten Tomatoes had a multitude of positive reviews with a few negatives ones sprinkled in. I decided I wasn't going to fall for the media circus surrounding this picture and would wait for it to come out on DVD.Now I have written screenplays before so I believe I can be quite critical from a screenwriter's standpoint given that I know what is involved when crafting a screenplay. Let's first review the movie:Juno tells the story of a 16 year old girl, sarcastic, smart and a bit too cocky for her own good as she finds out right at the start of the film that she is pregnant after having casual sex with her highschool boyfriend, Paulie Bleeker. Once Juno finds that she's pregnant, she informs her best girlfriend and they discuss what exactly she should do. Juno then breaks the news to her parents. Her parents give her the OK for an abortion ( a tad too cavalier in my opinion). Juno attempts the abortion route but gets cold feet. She then decides to give her baby up for adoption. She places an ad in the local paper and identifies a lovely wealthy couple who want to adopt. Will things go smoothly for Juno? How will she respond once she gives birth?For starters, this basic plot outline doesn't do much for me. I'm not intrigued by it and my curiosity has not been peaked. If I read the logline of this script it would not be one of my first reads. But let's begin to analyze this picture.Now I realize that each and every family on this planet is different. Parents are not the same all over when it comes to their emotional reactions. Juno's parents know very well the sharp-tongued verbal antics of their daughter (mother shown is actually step-mother to Juno) so one would take that into consideration. However, the reaction by both parents to Juno's admission of pregnancy is so calculated and without serious emotion that it begs the question, what kinds of parents are these people and would they actually exist in real life or are they just a caricature created by screenwriter Diablo Cody? One has to seriously ask this question because once Juno decides to initially opt for abortion wouldn't she at least bring one of her parents to go with her? Juno ends up visiting the abortion clinic alone! What kind of parent would send their teenager alone to an abortion clinic to get an abortion? It begs all credulity! I bring this up because it strikes at the very premise of Diablo Cody's smartly penned dialogue. These characters are indeed fictitious with not a shred of relevance to an actual family faced with the challenge of raising a ""know it all"" teenager.Once Juno enters the abortion clinic, the director tries to show how uncomfortable Juno is inside it by focusing on strange sounds the various people are making inside, (i.e. such as nail filing). The woman at the abortion clinic front desk appears to incongruous to say the least. No abortion clinic I've ever heard about or visited would ever feature such a character at the front desk. Again, this character was created by Diablo as a way to entertain the audience but at the same time ""creep"" Juno out from actually having an abortion.Let's discuss Juno's boyfriend, played by Michael Cera. The on-screen chemistry between Michael and Ellen Page (who plays Juno) is good but nothing to write home about. This is mainly due to the meekness of Michael Cera's character. They are such opposites that again, it strains credulity to think that a sarcastic ""know it all"" like Juno would be attracted to such an introvert like Michael Cera's character. I'm not saying it couldn't happen but Michael's character is bland, boring and dull.The two parents who consider adopting Juno's child, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, are played well and I don't have any real criticism for either character. Both actors perform well and the twist that Diablo Cody includes in their relationship provides for the drama that occurs later.I've come to the conclusion that the reason why this film gained such popularity is two: People were delightfully stunned by the crisp, back and forth repartee between characters (courtesy of Diablo Cody's sharply penned dialogue); the overall fine acting by all of the cast; and finally, audiences like movies where everything is taken into account and there are no serious questions left to ponder. Juno nicely wraps up by the end of the film and you're left with nothing more to ruminate on. At least I didn't.But as a screenwriter, I'm here to tell you that in cinema, if you want respect from a screenwriter, you've got to inject some plausibility into your screenplay! (Unless you're writing an action/adventure film like Rambo or a superhero film like Iron Man)Juno, as a drama/comedy, has no plausibility. Audiences who saw this film were simply looking to be entertained and they did not approach this film with the background of a screenwriter. But great dialogue does NOT MAKETH a GREAT MOVIE. Great dialogue ELEVATES a good story. But I can't say that Juno is even a good story. I'm not sure what is ""good"" about it especially when it treats one of the most polarizing topics in the United States (abortion) with such triteness!I've read interviews with Diablo Cody about how she came to write Juno, and what I found most interesting is that she focused more on the dialogue of her story than anything else. And in many ways, she had to! The story in and of itself, as it is presented on screen, is boring. It does not stimulate and it does not provoke. If the dialogue had fallen flat in this picture, Juno would not even have ranked a blip at the Toronto film festival. Now Juno COULD have been more stimulating a picture, if the issue of abortion had been delved upon much more in depth. But then that would have changed the point of the story. By avoiding the issue of abortion, Diablo make this film much more palatable to the movie going audience. She's no dummy!In conclusion, if you are looking for light entertainment, then go see Juno. The dialogue is what makes this film. Yes, Ellen Page does a masterful job of capturing the character of Juno. I actually hope to see her star some day in better films than Juno as she is obviously a capable actress. Time will tell. What I took from this picture was that audiences like films where everything is resolved by the end of the story and the lead character rides off into the sunset. Audiences enjoy seeing films that don't provoke and merely entertain. Audiences want to forget about ""reality"" and see a film that describes another world far removed from the one they are living in.",3,"An overrated film, it begs one to wonder how feeble minds could

We watched this terrible movie in Health class and all I could do was roll my eyes while everyone else laughed. I don't know if it was because they thought it was funny or if its because of how stupid this movie was and what a joke it was and still is. Its about a teenage girl named Juno who gets pregnant by stupidly having sex with a friend or boyfriend whoever he was to her. At first she wants to get an abortion and then she decides to give it up for adoption. When she tells her parents about how she got pregant their expressions were like they didn't care at all. They were like how thats aweful in monotone voices. But then their attitudes were like, ""Whatever lets go out to eat."" I also hate how this main girl is a smart alleck who makes this whole pregnant and giving up your child for adoption like a joke. I never understood how this movie got good reviews at all from critics. Whats really ridiculous is at one part of the movie was when Juno said that Chinese people sell their kids like ipods!!! Thats a very stupid thing to say since shes comparing human babies to things like ipods. This movie really glamorized teen pregnancy (so did Jamie Lynn Spears pregnancy) because I remember not long after this movie came out teen girls were getting pregnant on purpose. And a couple of them said it was because of this movie.

1117385,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B000YABYLA,Bill Garrison,"[3, 5]","Academy Award Best Picture nominee Juno is a quirky, cute comedy. I never once laughed out loud yet found the story of the pregnant teenage girl looking for a home for her baby to be perfectly enjoyable. This movie generated a lot of buzz and did quite well at the box office. I don't know if it ranks as one of the best pictures of the year (it was much better than Michael Clayton), but this is a fun movie that you should check out. Due to language and adult themes, it probably isn't for young kids.Juno is played by Ellen Page. Page is perfect as the 16-year old junior stunned by the shocking news she is pregnant. Juno is witty, sarcastic, extremely intelligent and passionate about life. She is also very vulnerable, and it shows during the times that her plans don't work out. Like getting pregnant, for example. She tries to deal with it on her own and seeks out a family planning center that doesn't require parental consent. Abortion is a controversial issue, but in a teen pregnancy movie, it had to be dealt with. The movie deals with it and gets it out of the way as quickly as possible. With the help of the one friend that sticks with her, Juno plans to find a couple to adopt her baby. She believes she has found the perfect couple in Vanessa and Mark Loring (played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman). Vanessa longs to have kids, but can't, and Mark is very laid back and at times more interested in classic rockn'roll. This is a strange couple and some of the best scenes are between Page and Bateman.The movie is backed by a great soundtrack. Diablo Cody's screenplay keeps you tuned to the screen. Juno's dad, played by JK Simmons, is very supportive of his daughter. Michael Cera plays the father of the child, Beeker. He loves Juno, but their relationship changes because of the pregnancy. Because the issue of teen pregnancy is somewhat idealized, this movie is sort of a fairy tale. Still, I really liked this movie.

1117386,A3KUEXN9M9FOMH,B000YABYLA,billy,"[5, 8]","I never really noticed the explosion of ""indie"" style and culture until fairly recently.  I graduated from college in May and even then I only had two classes, so somehow I missed all of the fashionable people in skinny jeans and Chuck Taylors walking around campus.  Someone will usually shout you down if you use the term indie too lightly, but to me the meaning has changed.  Before it was music or film that was made outside of major labels or major studios, and now it's a term used to describe cutsey and twee entertainment aimed at well scrubbed white folk.  There's nothing really independent about this stuff now, it's incredibly popular.That's exactly what Juno is, and boy does it try hard to be cool.  Everything from the over written dialogue, to the Wes Anderson style, to the name dropping of hip bands just exudes an air of coolness.  The movie starts out with some rapid fire dialogue, with a ROLFMAO dropped in there somewhere and of course plenty of ""girls can talk trash too"" type of dialogue.  About 10 minutes in I had a feeling that this could be overbearing as hell.Lucky for me the Juno actually has some heart.  Balanced among all of the hipster posturing and the over written dialogue is an actual heartwarming story.  It presents some tough choices for the main character Juno McGuff, played well by Ellen Page.  When she goes to an abortion clinic, she ends up leaving because she imagines her unborn baby with finger nails already.  Sometimes the smallest things remind you a persons (born or unborn) humanity.  She decides to give the baby up for adoption, and finds a seemingly idyllic couple in the Lorings.Vanessa Loring, played by Jennifer Garner, easily the least hip person in the whole movie, adds a lot of depth to the story.  Her unabashed yearning for motherhood really helps this movie from disappearing up its own behind with cultural references and detached irony.  Jason Bateman plays Vanessa's husband Mark Loring, a hip composer of commercial jingles who used to play in a rock band.  He's basically a grown up adolescent, watching corny horror movies and listening to Sonic Youth while his wife if off doing Pilates or whatever.  You know he's cool because his band opened for the Melvins.  Juno and Mark both develop some strange feelings for each other.  Juno thinks he's a really cool guy and an ideal father at first, and thinks Vanessa may be too straight laced.  But when Mark becomes more transparent in his intentions, Juno gets turned off.  Suffice to say things become very complicated between Juno, Mark, and Vanessa.Juno also has to come to terms with her goofy boyfriend Paulie Bleaker, played in a really subdued way by Michael Cera.  Cera isn't always this narcoleptic, but he plays the role of a shy and awkward teenager fairly well.  He obviously has trouble expressing himself to Juno, and he portrays that well on screen.  Juno's father, played by JK Simmons also shines.  He's easily the most naturally funny actor in the whole movie.  He delivers some genuinely funny lines, but he's also a loving father and very supportive, something that you don't see to often when a teenage mother is portrayed.Despite the obvious heart to the story, the cutesy twee elements started to irritate me after awhile.  The straight from Wes Anderson cross country runners dressed like weirdo's, the overbearing indie rock crooner soundtrack, and of course the overt name dropping of cool bands all seemed a bit contrived.  Juno's favorite bands are The Stooges, Patti Smith, and the Runaways, I mean, how cool is she?  Despite her penchant for raw power punk rock, the soundtrack is about as limp as they come.  It's all Belle and Sebastian, Cat Power, and Kimya Dawson.  I don't even think there's a single instance of percussion on the entire soundtrack, it's all acoustic balladry.Like many people, I'm beginning to feel a backlash towards this type of cinema and music.  It always irritates me a little to hear some of my favorite bands like The Shins get co-opted by commercials and movies, and sometimes I want to yell for these folks to get a backbone.  But in spite of these flaws, I enjoyed this movie.  It's not as great as someone like Roger Ebert would have you believe (it was his favorite movie of 2007), but it was a solid movie nonetheless.",3,"Kind of Overbearing, but a Likable Film",1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,4308,"['never', 'really', 'noticed', 'explosion', 'indie', 'style', 'culture', 'fairly', 'recently', 'graduated', 'college', 'May', 'even', 'then', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'classes', 'somehow', 'missed', 'fashionable', 'people', 'skinny', 'jeans', 'Chuck', 'Taylors', 'walking', 'around', 'campus', 'Someone', 'will', 'usually', 'shout', 'down', 'use', 'term', 'indie', 'too', 'lightly', 'meaning', 'changed', 'was', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'major', 'labels', 'major', 'studios', 'now', 'term', 'used', 'describe', 'cutsey', 'twee', 'entertainment', 'aimed', 'well', 'scrubbed', 'white', 'folk', 'nothing', 'really', 'independent', 'stuff', 'now', 'incredibly', 'popular.That', 'exactly', 'what', 'Juno', 'boy', 'try', 'hard', 'be', 'cool', 'Everything', 'over', 'written', 'dialogue', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'style', 'name', 'dropping', 'hip', 'bands', 'just', 'air', 'coolness', 'movie', 'out', 'rapid', 'fire', 'dialogue', 'ROLFMAO', 'dropped', 'somewhere', 'course', 'plenty', 'girls', 'can', 'talk', 'trash', 'too', 'type', 'dialogue', '10', 'minutes', 'had', 'feeling', 'could', 'be', 'overbearing', 'hell.Lucky', 'Juno', 'actually', 'heart', 'Balanced', 'hipster', 'posturing', 'over', 'written', 'dialogue', 'actual', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'tough', 'choices', 'main', 'character', 'Juno', 'McGuff', 'played', 'well', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'When', 'abortion', 'clinic', 'up', 'leaving', 'unborn', 'baby', 'finger', 'nails', 'already', 'Sometimes', 'smallest', 'things', 'remind', 'persons', 'born', 'unborn', 'humanity', 'give', 'baby', 'up', 'adoption', 'seemingly', 'idyllic', 'couple', 'Lorings.Vanessa', 'Loring', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'easily', 'least', 'hip', 'person', 'whole', 'movie', 'lot', 'depth', 'story', 'unabashed', 'yearning', 'motherhood', 'really', 'movie', 'disappearing', 'up', 'own', 'behind', 'cultural', 'references', 'detached', 'irony', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Vanessa', 'husband', 'Mark', 'Loring', 'hip', 'composer', 'commercial', 'jingles', 'who', 'used', 'play', 'rock', 'band', 'basically', 'grown', 'up', 'adolescent', 'watching', 'corny', 'horror', 'movies', 'listening', 'Sonic', 'Youth', 'wife', 'off', 'doing', 'Pilates', 'know', 'cool', 'band', 'opened', 'Melvins', 'Juno', 'Mark', 'develop', 'strange', 'feelings', 'other', 'Juno', 'really', 'cool', 'guy', 'ideal', 'father', 'first', 'thinks', 'Vanessa', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'straight', 'laced', 'when', 'Mark', 'more', 'transparent', 'intentions', 'Juno', 'turned', 'off', 'Suffice', 'say', 'things', 'become', 'very', 'complicated', 'Juno', 'Mark', 'Vanessa.Juno', 'also', 'come', 'terms', 'goofy', 'boyfriend', 'Paulie', 'Bleaker', 'played', 'really', 'subdued', 'way', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Cera', ""n't"", 'always', 'narcoleptic', 'role', 'shy', 'awkward', 'teenager', 'fairly', 'well', 'obviously', 'trouble', 'expressing', 'Juno', 'well', 'screen', 'Juno', 'father', 'played', 'JK', 'Simmons', 'also', 'easily', 'most', 'naturally', 'funny', 'actor', 'whole', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'lines', 'also', 'loving', 'father', 'very', 'supportive', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'often', 'when', 'teenage', 'mother', 'obvious', 'heart', 'story', 'cutesy', 'twee', 'elements', 'started', 'irritate', 'awhile', 'straight', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'cross', 'country', 'runners', 'dressed', 'weirdo', 'overbearing', 'indie', 'rock', 'crooner', 'soundtrack', 'course', 'overt', 'name', 'dropping', 'cool', 'bands', 'seemed', 'bit', 'contrived', 'Juno', 'favorite', 'bands', 'are', 'Stooges', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'Runaways', 'mean', 'how', 'cool', 'penchant', 'raw', 'power', 'punk', 'rock', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'limp', 'come', 'Belle', 'Sebastian', 'Cat', 'Power', 'Kimya', 'Dawson', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'single', 'instance', 'percussion', 'entire', 'soundtrack', 'acoustic', 'many', 'people', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'feel', 'backlash', 'type', 'cinema', 'music', 'always', 'little', 'hear', 'favorite', 'bands', 'Shins', 'get', 'co-opted', 'commercials', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'want', 'yell', 'folks', 'get', 'backbone', 'spite', 'flaws', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'someone', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'was', 'favorite', 'movie', '2007', 'was', 'solid', 'movie', 'nonetheless']",Juno

Neither could Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page,Hard Candy), a sassy and intelligent young girl who finds herself having to deal with this very issue in the highly acclaimed film JUNO.Once the rabbit dies, Juno is forced to come to terms with what she must do. Telling and not telling various people becomes a challenge, as does deciding whether or not to terminate the pregnancy. Once she decides against abortion (after a hysterical scene in the clinic where tapping fingernails play an annoying part), Juno decides to tell those closest to her. This includes the would-be father Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera,Superbad), a geekish track and field teen who's shocked to learn that his first time sexual encounter has also resulted in first time potential fatherhood, and her father Mac (J.K. Simmons,The Astronaut Farmer) and stepmother Bren (Allison Janney,Hairspray). Paulie seems equal parts embarrassed and elated (his seed has taken hold), while Juno's parents are dismayed, disappointed, but eventually supportive ...especially after they learn that she's decided to give up the baby to a couple that can't have kids (whom she finds advertising in the PennySaver).The unborn's future parents are the Lorings, Vanessa (Jennifer Garner,The Kingdom) and Mark (Jason Bateman,Smokin' Aces). Vanessa is agog with the anticipation of motherhood, while her husband, Mark, is more pensive, unsure if he's ready to take the dive into daddydom.The mixture of characters works well for the film with the only exception being that it was tough to swallow someone of J.K. Simmons' and Allison Janney's age being parents to a sixteen year old; they're a bit too old for those roles. Even so, the dialogue is stupendous, often making one forget that visual distraction and making them strain to catch every last nuanced syllable. And there are plenty.Although there aren't many teens out there with the intellect that Juno possesses, that's exactly what makes this film so watchable. It touches on an unfortunately ordinary premise (teen pregnancy) but pulls it up to a whole new level by allowing us to see it through the eyes of someone (Juno) battling with self-recognition during an age-crucial time.If there was ever any doubt that Ellen Page is one of the finest young actresses working in film today, Juno should put further arguments to rest. It is her razor-sharp line delivery that makes this film what it is: a character study of unusually funny proportions.",5,It's All In The Dialogue,1202169600,"02 5, 2008",2008,2500,"['Imagine', 'having', 'baby', 'when', ""'re"", 'sixteen', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'could', 'Juno', 'MacGuff', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'sassy', 'intelligent', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'having', 'deal', 'very', 'issue', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'JUNO.Once', 'rabbit', 'Juno', 'forced', 'come', 'terms', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'Telling', 'not', 'telling', 'various', 'people', 'challenge', 'deciding', 'not', 'terminate', 'pregnancy', 'abortion', 'hysterical', 'scene', 'clinic', 'where', 'tapping', 'fingernails', 'play', 'annoying', 'part', 'Juno', 'tell', 'closest', 'would-be', 'father', 'Paulie', 'Bleeker', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Superbad', 'geekish', 'track', 'field', 'teen', 'who', 'shocked', 'learn', 'first', 'time', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'also', 'resulted', 'first', 'time', 'potential', 'fatherhood', 'father', 'Mac', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'Bren', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Hairspray', 'Paulie', 'equal', 'parts', 'embarrassed', 'elated', 'seed', 'taken', 'hold', 'Juno', 'parents', 'are', 'dismayed', 'disappointed', 'eventually', 'supportive', 'especially', 'learn', 'decided', 'give', 'up', 'baby', 'couple', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'whom', 'advertising', 'PennySaver', '.The', 'unborn', 'future', 'parents', 'are', 'Lorings', 'Vanessa', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Kingdom', 'Mark', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'Vanessa', 'agog', 'anticipation', 'motherhood', 'husband', 'Mark', 'more', 'pensive', 'unsure', 'ready', 'take', 'dive', 'daddydom.The', 'mixture', 'characters', 'works', 'well', 'film', 'only', 'exception', 'being', 'was', 'tough', 'swallow', 'someone', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'age', 'being', 'parents', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', ""'re"", 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'roles', 'Even', 'so', 'dialogue', 'stupendous', 'often', 'making', 'one', 'forget', 'visual', 'distraction', 'making', 'strain', 'catch', 'last', 'nuanced', 'syllable', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'teens', 'out', 'there', 'intellect', 'Juno', 'possesses', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'watchable', 'unfortunately', 'ordinary', 'premise', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'up', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'allowing', 'see', 'eyes', 'someone', 'Juno', 'battling', 'self-recognition', 'age-crucial', 'time.If', 'was', 'ever', 'doubt', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'one', 'finest', 'young', 'actresses', 'working', 'film', 'today', 'Juno', 'should', 'put', 'further', 'arguments', 'rest', 'razor-sharp', 'line', 'delivery', 'film', 'what', 'character', 'study', 'unusually', 'funny', 'proportions']",Juno
1117389,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B000YABYLA,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[1, 1]","""Juno,"" it seems to me, is all about unconditional love.  Everyone is looking for love.  Everyone.  And when we find it, its usually a function of some condition - how weathy, attractive, powerful, well-behaved, or talented we are.  We won't admit it, but we know it.By getting pregnant at sixteen, Juno the title character, commits a serious lapse in judgement upon which we might expect some of the love she receives to be conditioned (i.e., we will love you only as long as you don't make terrible mistakes).  Instead, her father, stepmother, best friend, and boyfriend (the father of the baby) all step up wonderfully, and in their own unique ways, to remind Juno that their love is not a function of her ""irresponsibility,"" to quote her father.But there are even more lessons about unconditional love here.  We learn about it from the adoptive mother who already loves the unborn baby unconditionally.  Juno, the recipient of unconditional love herself, is therefore able to recognize it in this woman, so she decides to follow through with the adoption.Ellen page is spectacular in this role.  We will have to wait and see if its just roles like this which appear to be made for her, or whether its raw talent.

It's not groundbreaking, or worth all the hype, but it's entertaining, and that's all that really matters.  And at 90 minutes, it avoids the cardinal sin of outlasting its welcome.I never thought Jennifer Garner was a good actress, but she is excellent in this film.  I don't know if it was the direction or the script, but she walks the knife edge between being sympathetic and domineering perfectly.  And Jason Bateman plays a different character than he usually does.  Sadly, for fans of Arrested Development, he doesn't have a single scene with Michael Cera.  Cera isn't in this movie very much, but he is great whenever he's in a scene.  Who would have thought he would turn out to be the big breakout movie star of Arrested Development?On the downside, the dialogue is often a bit too cutesy and precious for its own good, especially toward the beginning of the movie.  And, like all movies with teenagers, the characters don't act like real teenagers.  Nonetheless, my wife (who works at a high school) says that ""Juno"" gets closer than a lot of movies to what teenagers are actually like.I'd recommend ""Juno"" as a rental.

Neely ""BellaOnline Comedy Movies S...","[2, 2]","Juno (directed by Jason Reitman) is a sugary romantic teen comedy that also doubles as a coming of age story.Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is a hip, quirky teenager that must learn to ""deal with things way beyond her maturity level"". She becomes pregnant by her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) and enlists the help of her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) to search for adoptive parents. They promptly find the seemingly ""perfect"" couple in the penny saver, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). Her father (J.K. Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney) are surprisingly (and a little unrealistically supportive.As she navigates the world of teen pregnancy, she discovers that life does not always work out the way anyone plans it to.The beginning lines from Rainn Wilson's character are out of place in even Juno's world. This is the only dialogue that seems grossly unrealistic. The rest of the dialogue can be described as eccentric and it is constantly referencing pop culture. Despite this it appears natural to me. The movie makes me accept that this is merely how Juno and her friends speak. This is nothing out of the ordinary in their world.Page was terrific in her role. She was cynical, hilarious and relatable all at the same time. I honestly wish I viewed life in the way she does. It's one of a kind and not to mention humorous. Cera is once again good at playing awkward. He always succeeds at doing this. His character gives off a quirky, nerdy vibe.My favorite scenes include the chemistry lab and when Juno is trying to find a couple to adopt her baby. The writing by Diablo Cody and execution from Page, Cera and Thirlby is brilliant.The indie soundtrack also meshes nicely with the movie. I get the sense that the songs were picked carefully. They add to the overall tone and mood of whatever scene they are in. ""A Well Respected Man"" by The Kinks is the perfect description of Cera's character.However, Juno does stray from reality when it shouldn't Her parents barely protest when she announces she is pregnant. The adoptive parents are found in almost a moment's notice and not much is said about her pregnancy at school. She is given looks but nothing else. While I'm not advocating the ostracization of a teenager, I think it's unrealistic for no one in her school to make a negative comment about it.Overall Juno will please anyone that is OK with the strange dialogue. I think it adds to the movie and makes it incredibly unique. But it also a major part of the movie and may turn some away.

She goes through a few pregnancy tests, calls up her friend to share her burden, frets for a moment and then bravely takes on the role of being a pregnant high schooler.  Although, the ultimate theme of this film is a teenager dealing with pregnancy, it has a larger theme of the this incredible girl discovering life and love along the journey.The whole movie is carried by this young girl, played by Ellen Page, and Ellen Page deserves all the hype that she got from this movie.  Juno is quirky, smart, sassy, original and adorable and she is played with so much heart.  She may be a teenager but she is a fabulous heroine and one of the most interesting film characters of the recent years.Everyone in the movie is flawlessly casted from Michael Cera, who plays the guy responsible for Juno's pregnancy, to the store clerk who has a two-minute scene in the movie.  I must say, Michael Cera totally brought sexy back in the geeks.Like a good indie film, this movie was definitely anti-hollywood.  The average looking folks were the smarter people and the geek wins the heart of the quirk.

There's some simple but upbeat music, but none of it belongs in a movie riven by gut-wrenching crises.  There's many snappy lines by the lead, Ellen Page, but none of them seem to fit the moment in the movie (e.g., like I'm so sure that when admitting what's happened to her parents -- who up to this point aren't even aware that she's ""sexually active"" -- she'd be quipping that Bleeker had been so ""good in chair."")  That just didn't strike me as reality.So heck.  If you take away the snappy dialogue and the fun movie, you're left with quite the forgettable script.  And I don't wanna hear people saying that Ellen Page is a great actress:  this role was totally easy!  She never had to invest in it, so to speak.  The only scene in which she really had to lay it ont he line was the crying scene in the car.  Big whup.

In a more perfect world there would be dozens of such films made every year. Since so much schlock gets made then this film stands out to many as some sort of minor masterpiece. It was not. It was just a simple film. Because of all the praise I came to it expecting a bit more.Juno is a 16 year old girl going on 46. She was way too worldly. There was nothing she did not know. She never seemed upset about her situation except once. She also used the word ""cavalier"". I could not help but wonder how many 16 year old girls know Iggy and the Stooges, Thundercats, and use the word cavalier. I am betting zero. Of course now they all know, because they have seen this film.The film also made light of a rather serious problem. The only reason I could discern for this was to make young pregnant girls who are afraid and insecure feel a bit more empowered.Ultimately the film was overwritten and could not make up it's mind if it wanted to be Napolean Dynamite or Kramer VS Kramer. It needed more focus and less silliness. Or more silliness and less reality. Either way it was middle of the road and did nothing too shocking, hence it's mass appeal. When the protagonist is in a bind and is cocky and sure, well that is not reality. If her attitude was meant to be defensive, then no other side was ever shown, except when she found out she might not have someone to give the baby too. That was too late in the film for a breakdown as far as I am concerned.Thank God nothing happened with her and the adoptive father. For a bit it was leaning that way and that would have been a disaster.This film is not going to ruffle many feathers because it does not go to all the places it could or should have.3 stars for effort, good acting, and witty remarks.

1117409,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000YABYLA,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 3]","Of all the offbeat, heartwarming dramatic comedies of recent memory, Jason Reitman's ""Juno"" is definitely one of the better ones. It tells the story of an independent teenage girl who finds herself faced with an unplanned pregnancy: a realistic scenario, no question, and for some, it's even relatable. Ellen Page--whose performance in 2005's ""Hard Candy"" scared the living hell out of me--plays the title character, utilizing an entirely different but equally effective emotional range. Sixteen-year-old Juno MacGuff is a lively yet misunderstood young woman, always making wry comments on everything and everyone. Some of her comments are downright inappropriate. You wouldn't expect a girl like this to be foolish and have unprotected sex, but as she says later on, ""I don't know what kind of girl I am.""The baby's father is her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), a quiet, lanky teen who loves Tic Tacs and has a passion for running. One gets the sense that he doesn't actually say most of what he's thinking; when Juno tells him that she's pregnant because of that one night, all he can think to say is, ""Whose idea was it?"" In Juno's eyes, he's just about the coolest guy on the planet. But she knows that he's not ready to be a parent, and as it turns out, neither is she. This is probably why they both agree that an abortion is the best idea. Of course, Juno is unable to go through with it by the time she reaches the clinic; she said that it smelled like a dentist's office, and she couldn't stand the girl at the help desk (a goth-type who offers her a boysenberry-scented condom). With abortion no longer an option, she settles on giving the baby up for adoption.And as it happens, an ad in the Pennysaver shows a black and white photo of a couple looking to adopt. Here enter Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa Loring (Jennifer Garner), who live in an upscale gated community. As is the case with a lot of couples, their attempts to conceive have been unsuccessful; Jennifer is desperate to be a mother, and Mark seems ready and willing to be a father. When Juno enters their lives, they agree on a closed-door policy, meaning that Juno wants absolutely nothing to do with the baby after it's born: she doesn't want the Lorings to keep in touch with her or to send her updates. With everything seemingly set in stone, the papers are signed and the deals are made.Things start to change when Juno has her first ultrasound. She immediately drives back to the Lorings' home, hoping to show them a picture of their unborn baby. Because only Mark is home, an unlikely friendship is kick started: they have the same tastes in music (although they disagree about the best year for punk rock--Mark says 1992 while Juno says 1977); they both play electric guitars, Juno having been part of a band and Mark being an advertisement composer; they both love excessively gory horror films, and Mark convinces Juno that the films of Dario Argento are tame compared to the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis. All this seems innocent enough, but don't you already get the sense that something inappropriate is going on here? Not inappropriate in the sexual sense, but definitely in the sense that neither Juno nor Mark are setting up boundaries. He will, after all, be parenting her child; forming a friendship will probably do more harm than good.And consider a moment when Juno and her girlfriend are at the mall: Juno sees Vanessa in the kids' area, energetically playing with one of her friend's young children. This makes Juno smile, because it's clear that Vanessa is serious about wanting to be a mother. The same can't be said for Mark, who may not, in fact, be ready to go through with an adoption. Keep in mind that he and Juno never speak about the baby or even parenthood during one of her visits; all their conversations focus on personal interests, and as we all know, personal interests have absolutely no place in the life of a parent. This eventually begins to bring Juno down, threatening to destroy her already limited faith in humanity.All this affects her relationship with Paulie, who doesn't understand what it's like to be a pregnant high school student. Not only does everyone clear away from her as she walks down the hall, they also stare uncontrollably at her swelling stomach. Nevertheless, she begins to suspect that her feelings for Paulie may run deeper than she first thought, which forces her to put her life into perspective: while she may not always get along with her father (J.K. Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney), and while home may sometimes get hectic, the reality is that it's still home, and as the saying goes, home is where the heart is.What exactly would a film like this have to offer the everyday person? I questioned that many times as I watched, and my initial conclusion was, ""Not a heck of a lot."" This is, after all, an oddball film about an oddball character in an oddball situation. But as I left the theater and began the drive home, my thoughts gradually shifted, and I began to realize that this film offers quite a lot. It cleverly shows that life is always in a state of flux, and no matter what we do to prepare, some unexpected things will happen. Granted, this is not a new idea, but considering how well made this film is--how relatable the characters are (if a little strange) and how nicely the story unfolds--it doesn't really matter.",4,She's

Normally one wouldn't say that about a film centering around teen pregnancy, a failed marriage and broken hearts, but in his case? Yeah!""Juno"" for those of you who have been living in caves, is a film about a young girl who, after a night's indiscretion with her best friend, becomes pregnant. Initially planning to get an abortion, she changes her mind and decides to put the baby up for adoption. It goes from there.What I like about this movie is that all the characters are treated with respect, especially Juno's parents who, when she tells them her ""good"" news, don't respond with the sort of hysterics you'd normally see in a movie. No, they handle it like you'd imagine such people would; quiet disapointment, but slightly proud of her for handling it as an adult.The writing is sharp, though a little twee for the first twenty minutes or so. Then it settles down into a nice, intelligent screenplay that doesn't talk down to the audience. All the plot twists seem earned, and all the emotions seem real.The acting all around is great, particularly Ellen Page as the title character. She brings a real charm and charisma to the movie that would be absent with almost anyone else in the role.The movie isn't without flaws.

1117412,ASU5IH3CM6XXE,B000YABYLA,ChrisTyrrell,"[13, 83]","First off, a disclaimer: I love independent films.  The quirkier the better!  When a movie like Happy Little Sunshine, or Memento comes out, I get excited because I know it's going to have a different point of view that appeals to all of my sensisibilities.  But, however, I did not like Juno because it sends a clear message to all unwed mothers and fathers that teen pregnancy is something worth laughing about.  It is no laughing matter!First off, I should say that I do believe there was a great script written by Diablo Cody, and there are terrific performances by Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Batement.  It is really a stellar cast, and they really bring the story to life.  Also I will say that the soundtrack is top notch and I think the director did an excellent job from beginning to end.First of all, it's not very believable that kids that young are going to get that pregnant at their age.  Some kids do have children when they're too young, but this movie is a comedy and should not be based on real life.  Also, the main characters all say twisted little cliches that are far really too clever to come from people who are are living in a dumb town.  Maybe people from New York talk that way, but come on!I think, first of all, that this movie would have been better as a drama, because that's the kind of movies I like most.  But if it couldn't be a drama, then at least it should have been more like real life.  I'm not saying they should have made it a documentary (although I think Michael Cera would be very funny in one of those) but maybe they should have.  Teenaged pregnancy is a dicey issue for a lot of groups and Juno makes fun of how tough a situation it can be.All in all, I think this is not a good movie to watch on DVD, but probably better on the big screen.

People seemed genuinely excited that after the bombast of last summer, here comes a film that actually took story and character first and yet now people have completely turned on the film and called it overrated and not funny at all. While there's some nitpicks I can say about the film, the amount of backlash and criticisms laid upon the film seem kind of unfair. This film isn't made to get the discussions going and highlight social issues a la the Iraq War films; it's just simply a family movie, lighthearted in tone and fun to watch.Juno MacGuff is a young 16 year old who discovers that a night with best friend Paulie Bleeker brings the gift of pregnancy, or burden in her case and wants to have an abortion. Changing her mind and having birth go straight to adoption, she finds the perfect parents in Mark and Vanessa Loring but what we want and what we get can be 2 completely different things as Juno learns about life the hard way earlier than most.Juno can be described as a message film with the message actually never being said out loud. Whereas most films are content to have the theme said in dialogue, Juno takes the more smarter approach in showing the responsibilities and changing views that can come with pregnancy and it's not enough to be able to financially handle it, you have to know personally you can. Course many parents become unexpected mothers and fathers and many succeed but Juno doesn't explicitly say out loud the idea of ""be prepared to handle the surprises of life"" but it still works in the end.First, my one negative and its in the writing. Award-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody writes a very touching, sweet and realistic portrayal of the changes that come with parenthood which I felt were nicely handled but then we get the dialogue. Lines like ""honest to blog?"" and ""Thundercats are go!"" to signal the water breaking just seem...strange and you start to ask yourself whether anyone, let alone young teenagers, talk like this. But then other lines work and some of it was actually funny but I can see why people might not find it working for the film.Acting-wise it largely falls on Ellen Page's shoulders who shows the maturity and yet the naivety of someone old enough to know she doesn't know everything. We also get turns from reliable Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's parents, Jennifer Garn..um, Affleck, and Michael Cera who always brings that deadpan humor though sometimes I feel it's just his Arrested Development character in movie form, but it's still a solid acting ensemble.Even though it looks like a film for everyone, not everyone will get its brand of humor but like the film anyway while others find it completely unfunny but I'd give it a shot anyway though to test the waters, try it with a crowd.

The offspring of some of the movie industry's best directors have begun to assert themselves with their own, distinct voices.  Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), whose father is Francis Coppola of The Godfather fame, Nick Cassavetes (The Notebook) whose father John Cassavetes pioneered independent films, and now Jason Reitman whose father is Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame, have all proven that talent can be in the genes.  Reitman has perfectly realized his vision of a coming-of-age drama, Juno, based on a fabulous script by newbie, Diablo Cody.  This small, original film has enough intelligence and creative filmmaking to stand among bigger budgeted studio releases as among the best of 2007.Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is a sixteen year old high schooler whose planned sexual encounter results in an unplanned pregnancy that causes a sensation among her classmates and at home with her dad and stepmom.  A smart, sassy-mouthed loner, Juno, after deliberating on whether or not to abort the unborn, takes matters in her own hands and decides to donate her baby to an adopting, yuppie couple, Mark and Vanessa.  Life is not so easy as situations change suddenly, and the dynamics of Mark and Vanessa throw everything into a tailspin as Juno's life becomes much more complicated.  Wondering if couples can ever really stay together and if true love can exist, Juno makes some hard, mature choices in her life.The movie is presented in a unique format with actual, script lines subtitling the bottom of every shot.  It's almost as if the DVD extras are being used onscreen.  This device, while interesting, can be a bit annoying too.  A series of ballads punctuate and underscore the narrative much like Cat Stevens did in Harold and Maude.  It does enhance the story and mood.  The structure of the narrative is sectioned by the seasons beginning with autumn.High school life is portrayed in a convincing manner with the behaviors and interplay dead on target.  Some individual scenes like Juno's parents first hearing and fearing what big announcement Juno has in store for them, or the confrontation with the ultrasound technician are pretty amusing.  And there are quiet, introspective moments like between Juno and her dad or with her `boyfriend' Bleeker that are quite touching.Ellen Page already made her mark with the recent Hard Candy and showed her versatility in X Men-The Last Stand, but to exhibit that rare combination of drama and humor in a believable manner is quite a feat.  There is not one false note in her impressive performance.  You begin to place yourself in her position and empathize through her joy and pain.  The rest of the cast is strong, and each has good portions of dialogue to capitalize upon.  J .K. Simmons is quickly becoming a go-to character actor as Juno's dad, and you wish Allison Janney had a bit juicier part to fly with as the stepmom.  Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are quite good as the prospective, adoptive parents.  Michael Cera (Superbad) and Olivia Thirlby make convincing schoolmates.We discover with Juno that life can be full of unexpected surprises and twists, and it is how we deal with those events that can have a profound and lasting effect on one's future and happiness.  (I can't wait for writer Cody's next story.)  When you think about it, the screenplay rings true throughout without being preachy or awkward; it just sounds like it could really happen.  That's what makes Juno a terrific slice of life tale, a deceptively simple story with a rich core of acting and words.

Once the studio realized that it had a successful crowd-pleaser on its hands, the film was promoted from the art-house circuit to the multiplexes. Actress Ellen Page and first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody became the film's breakout stars garnering the lion's share of critical raves and awards with Page getting an Independent Spirit Award and Cody an Academy Award. Now that all of the dust has settled, Juno can be reassessed to see if it really has the staying power and substance to cut through all of the hype and stand-up to the inevitable backlash.There is an audio commentary by director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody. The first thing that you notice when listening to Cody talking is how well Ellen Page mimicked her way of speaking. Reitman tends to dominate the track and, not surprisingly, talks about filmmaking aspects like the casting of minor roles, the attention to details for the sets, how he shot certain scenes, and so on. This is pretty decent track filled with lots of anecdotal stories and production details.Also included are 11 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Reitman and Cody. We meet Juno's crazy next-door neighbour. There's also a different introduction to Juno's family. We see Mark and Vanessa's first attempt to adopt. There's also an amusing bit where Juno has a solo gig and sings a song about getting pregnant. These are all good scenes and Reitman explains why there were cut.There is the obligatory ""Gag Reel,"" a hilarious collection of blown lines and goofs with Bateman making Page break character time and time again.The ""Gag Take"" is an odd scene where Rainn Wilson and Reitman get into it with a mock heated argument.""Cast and Crew Jam"" features the cast and crew members rockin' out to a song in this mock music video.There are ""Screen Tests"" for Ellen Page and Michael Cera.

The first fourth of the movie she came off as a 26-year-old smart-mouth instead of a 16-year-old.  Maybe the dialogue improved; maybe I just got used to it.  My wife urged me to rent this film and then wondered why.  About one-third of the way through, I ask her if she thought anything was ever going to happen.  She replied that she hoped so, but it hadn't to that point.  The attitude this film toward teenage pregnancy was so cavalier as to be off-putting on its own.  I guess they've never heard that it is the number one cause of poverty among women.  The movie hardly touched on the powerful emotions that such an experience would create in a young girl.  There was the inevitable put-down of the only person in the movie who made any sense - the ultrasound technician.  The Hollywood elites apparently thought it mandatory to allow moral relativism once again to triumph over common sense.  And by the way, the music throughout this movie was insipid.

1117432,A2PZ1W2Q4JQQWA,B000YABYLA,"Devon Christopher Adams ""www.nooccar.com""","[1, 1]","Last week my wife turned 30 and she sent me an email that she wanted to see a couple movies sooner than later. Her number one pick was Juno. I had heard wonderful things about this film, and every year around this time I begin seeing as many Oscar nominated movies as I can. So her email was a good excuse to get out and see Juno, which is up for best Director, Original Screenplay, Actress, etc... So there we went. Off to see Juno today. Last year I began writing movie reviews for everything I see during Oscar season, and that begins with a wonderfully scripted film that the critics believe is an anti-abortion film. And so what if it may be? That's not the point here.What is the point is a fantastic small budget film that has exploded onto the silver screen. Diablo Cody, as writer, has created a refreshingly invigorating script that I could almost chomp down into my corporeal self. The dialogue's originality was unlike most of what I've read or heard in recent months. Cody has emerged everywhere in the last several months from the screen to the columnist at the back of ""Entertainment Weekly"" sitting next to my commode.Initially the opening song irked me, and I felt like the soundtrack may be almost overpowering for such a subtle film. I will admit I never forgot what I was hearing when a song came on screen, but by the finale of the film my wife and I both completely adored the music. We'd never heard of the Moldy Peaches or Antsy Pants before, but they sure are joining my iTunes play list tonight.Even though the film editing and quirky cinematography (from the muddy runny shoes of Micheal Cera's Bleeker and striped socks of Ellen Page's title character in the hospital bed to the shot of Page driving into suburbia as the camera climbs into the sky above her minivan) reminded me of my love for the mere perfect camera shots of films like American Beauty, Diablo Cody's script dialogue was phenomenal. For example, Allison Janney, as Juno's step mother, told the x-ray technician ""My five year-old daughter could do that, and let me tell you, she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed. So why don't you go back to night school in Manteno and learn a real trade!"" Witty banter, obscure allusions, and thinking man's dialgoue is what really turned me on to this film, although the metaphors and symbols kissed my eyes like a soft summer rain or a cool afternoon. SPOILER COMING. STOP NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW. Ok, I've warned you. For example, after Juno discovers Mark is leaving Vanessa, she speeds off to stop alongside the highway, and the shot (once again above the minivan) shows she pulled off the side of the highway next to a half destroyed boat next to a canal running along side the highway, deep like the womb of hope and eventuality, while on the other side of the highways trains run along tracks in one direction without any hope of every getting off that path. The runners push against Juno as she walks down the street in the beginning of the movie, and her boyfriend, Bleeker, is a runner, but by the film's end, the track team runs by, and he is now sitting by her side on the steps playing the brilliantly written ""Anyone Else But You"" by the Moldy Peaches. Page & Cera's singing of the theme song at the end just is another example of this young woman's talents.Which does bring me back to the Lorings. The first quarter of the movie seems relatively light and fun (yes, even when Juno tells her father and step mother she's pregnant), and then she meets the Loring's. I sat back just waiting for some soft of conflict and eventually got it. Mark, played by Jason Bateman (whose squashed nose bugs me), is a likable guy who reminds me of Neal Pollack, and his high tension wife played poorly by the very non-sterile Mrs Affleck, Jennifer Garner) is the kind of character you want to hate. In the end I realized that Mark Loring is a total noob, while the audience is suppose to commiserate with Vanessa's sterility and subsequent motherhood. No, I didn't.This movie felt very real to me. Researching a bit online to write this review (yeah, do you really think I remembered Janney's quote verbatim? Nah...) I was pleasantly surprised by how many awards Cody's won so far for this film. With that in mind, and while I am still high on a fun-loving film, I would say the former stripper devil girl as a good chance of winning gold come February, albeit Page's got some stiff competition; her nomination may be her award, but hopefully she doesn't get pregnant (for real) and fall into obscurity like Keisha Castle-Hughes.",5,Rent this one ...

1117435,AC63924IPU3IS,B000YABYLA,"DKMI ""dkmi""","[6, 7]","Obviously by now everyone has heard the hype surrounding this movie.  Unfortunately, the hype has assisted my lukewarm rating of this movie.  A scant three minutes into the movie and one has to wonder how Diablo Cody won an Oscar for writing such fake dialogue.The lead character, Juno, is in a pharmacy purchasing a pregnancy test.  Her interaction with the clerk was the stuff you can only find in a movie.  No one talks like they do.  The clerk and Juno both spoke like they were from another planet.  Unfortunately, we're subjected to little more than this type of dialogue for the first two thirds of the movie.  It was as though Diablo Cody watched Quentin Tarantino movies and then decided to try her hand at writing sarcastic, quick-witted banter.  She has a very long way to go.  One-liners don't make for conversation.I feel that most of the hype about the writing was due to the fact that it was different.  Not that it was really good, but because it is different than typical Hollywood fare.  Different doesn't equal good here.  Nothing is more ridiculous than when, upon being told by Juno that she is pregnant, her father comments that he didn't think the boy who knocked her up ""had it in him"".  The ho-hum manner that everyone takes to the situation is very unrealistic and distracts from the story.  No one seems to take the matter seriously.  Not her father, not the boy's family, not the boy, and not Juno herself.So how did I end up giving this movie three stars rather than one?  Well, the story found its way in the last half hour.  I found Little Miss Sunshine to be like this as well.  Most of the movie was rather dull, but the ending was so good that it made up for the rest.  Juno has a similar quality.  We finally see resemblence of humanity when Juno finds out the perfect couple she chose to adopt her baby aren't the perfect couple she thought they were.  We finally see some realistic interaction between father and daughter.  We see a woman who cannot have her own children distressed over the uncertainty of the adoption process.  You can feel her uneasiness.  After Juno gives birth, her boyfriend visits her in the hospital and there is a real tender scene between them.  Alas we see Juno as a vulnerable child having to deal with the weight of having a baby and giving it up.  I found the final scene to be rather charming as Juno and her boyfriend sit and play guitars and sing a tune together.  It's still unrealistic, but nevertheless it was a nice finish.There are better movies about intelligent, self-aware, teenage girls who struggle as misfits to find their calling.  One that comes to mind that is better written and superbly executed is Ghost World.  It stars Thora Birtch, Scarlett Johansson, and Steve Buscemi.  The movie isn't for everyone, but if you're interested in a Juno-type movie, Ghost World is far superior.Ghost World",3,"Worth a Look, But Don't Expect Greatness",1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,2879,"['Obviously', 'now', 'everyone', 'heard', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'hype', 'assisted', 'lukewarm', 'rating', 'movie', 'scant', 'three', 'minutes', 'movie', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'won', 'Oscar', 'writing', 'such', 'fake', 'dialogue.The', 'lead', 'character', 'Juno', 'pharmacy', 'purchasing', 'pregnancy', 'test', 'interaction', 'clerk', 'was', 'stuff', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'movie', 'one', 'talks', 'do', 'clerk', 'Juno', 'spoke', 'were', 'planet', 'Unfortunately', ""'re"", 'subjected', 'little', 'more', 'type', 'dialogue', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'was', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'watched', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'movies', 'then', 'decided', 'try', 'hand', 'writing', 'sarcastic', 'quick-witted', 'banter', 'very', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'One-liners', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'conversation.I', 'feel', 'most', 'hype', 'writing', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'different', 'Not', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'different', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'Different', ""n't"", 'equal', 'good', 'here', 'Nothing', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'being', 'told', 'Juno', 'pregnant', 'father', 'comments', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'boy', 'who', 'knocked', 'had', 'ho-hum', 'manner', 'everyone', 'situation', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'distracts', 'story', 'one', 'take', 'matter', 'seriously', 'Not', 'father', 'not', 'boy', 'family', 'not', 'boy', 'not', 'Juno', 'herself.So', 'how', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'giving', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'rather', 'one', 'Well', 'story', 'found', 'way', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'found', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'be', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'Most', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'dull', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'made', 'up', 'rest', 'Juno', 'similar', 'quality', 'finally', 'see', 'resemblence', 'humanity', 'when', 'Juno', 'out', 'perfect', 'couple', 'chose', 'adopt', 'baby', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'couple', 'thought', 'were', 'finally', 'see', 'realistic', 'interaction', 'father', 'daughter', 'see', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'own', 'children', 'distressed', 'uncertainty', 'adoption', 'process', 'can', 'feel', 'uneasiness', 'Juno', 'birth', 'boyfriend', 'hospital', 'real', 'tender', 'scene', 'see', 'Juno', 'vulnerable', 'child', 'having', 'deal', 'weight', 'having', 'baby', 'giving', 'found', 'final', 'scene', 'be', 'rather', 'charming', 'Juno', 'boyfriend', 'sit', 'play', 'guitars', 'sing', 'tune', 'together', 'still', 'unrealistic', 'was', 'nice', 'finish.There', 'are', 'better', 'movies', 'intelligent', 'self-aware', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'struggle', 'misfits', 'find', 'calling', 'One', 'mind', 'better', 'written', 'superbly', 'executed', 'Ghost', 'World', 'Thora', 'Birtch', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'movie', ""n't"", 'everyone', ""'re"", 'interested', 'Juno-type', 'movie', 'Ghost', 'World', 'far', 'superior.Ghost', 'World']",Juno

Soon, Juno has to grapple with the fact that she would be an unwed mother. Whilst visiting an abortion clinic, she got cold feet (partly due to her activist classmate Su-Ching's one-girl protest outside the clinic). From then on, her search for a pair of perfect adoptive parents leads her to the Lorings played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner. The film shows Page's evolution into a precocious young lady with lots of humor and more heart.Ellen Page's acting is surprisingly mature. It looks as if she's not just acting but rather living the role. The script by Diablo Cody is witty and  bittersweet. The supporting cast works well to illuminate Page's role.

I know my perspective on films is a bit different than most, but if a film gets lots of positive buzz, I'm usually not disappointed in it.JUNO did not live up to my expectations.  First, what is it trying to be?  A comedy?  It has funny moments, but nothing to make it stand out.  A drama?  Certainly not a compelling drama.  Dramedy?  Frankly, BOSTON LEGAL does better dramedy on a weekly basis...The character of Juno immediately reminded me of the George Lass character from DEAD LIKE ME.  Teen girl with no direction or self-identity.  Unfortunately, George Lass had the opportunity to develop into a fascinating character over time.  Juno doesn't get that chance.I figured I had to like the film because of the supporting cast -- Jennifer Garner, J. K. Simmons and especially Allison Janney.  I love all of them.  The characters played by Simmons and Janney were the only ones in the film I cared about, and they have very little screen time.  I never had any motivation to care what happened with Jennifer Garner's character, or what was happening with Jason Bateman's character, either.Script-wise, I also felt the story went down a predictable path and never drew me totally into it.  While there is some clever dialogue in the film, the story itself never made me concerned for Juno, her baby, or her choices.So I guess my advice to the viewer is:  Don't believe the hype.

1117441,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000YABYLA,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Let's face it -- teen pregnancy is an ongoing problem, and is not something admirable or funny. But I have to admit, the way you handle it can be.That seems to be the goal of ""Juno,"" a relentlessly quirky, cracking-wise little comedy about a girl who makes a dumb mistake, and the smart decisions she has to make after that. While it initially seems rather precious, the Wes Andersonesque scriptings hide a bittersweet, warm little story about responsibility and love.After a lot of Sunny D and three pregnancy tests, Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) comes to the inevitable conclusion: she's pregnant by her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).Because she ""heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant,"" Juno initially goes in for an abortion, but ends up running out of the clinic. Instead, she's going to have the baby and give it to someone who wants one, but can't have it. So she reluctantly fesses up to her parents, and starts scouting ads for suitably (if unedgy) parents for her baby -- the wealthy Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner).Mark and Juno form a bond over their shared tastes, but she starts to suspect that not all is well in Yuppieland -- especially when Mark decides to break up with Vanessa, because fatherhood would force him to be a grown-up, not a rock god. As her due date approaches, Juno must decide what is best for herself, Vanessa, the baby... and just maybe, the adoring Paulie.Recliners on the lawn, cactus-grams, guitars with names and ""The Wizard of Gore"" -- it's pretty obvious that ""Juno"" will win prizes for kooky quirk, if nothing else. It certainly has that in spades, and while it has some awkwardly scripted moments, the colourful and acerbic portrait of a teenage girl having to make some heavy adult decisions is definitely a winning one.Admittedly, ""Juno"" is a bit too precious in the first few scenes, when we have a weird store clerk saying things like ""Your eggo is preggo"" and getting replies like ""Silencio!"" Come on, loosen up and stop trying to be cooler-than-thou.But as the pregnancy storyline really kicks in, ""Juno"" settles into a storyline that is equal parts quirky-funny and touching. Jason Reitman flavours the whole plot with his snappy, clever direction with plenty of acid-laced voiceovers from Juno, on the world around her. And Diablo Cody's dialogue ranges from deliciously sharp (""I'm not crying, I'm just allergic to fine home furnishing"") to entertainingly over-the-top (""Phuket, Thailand!"").But as witty and quirky as the plot is, it wouldn't be much if it didn't also have a heart. As the movie winds on, we get to see Juno maturing -- learning to weigh coolness vs. maturity, appreciate her family, and what is right for her baby and the Lorings -- the scene where Juno helps an upset Vanessa talk to her baby is adorable. Not to mention that our pregnant heroine has to figure out whether true love is staring her in the face.Ellen Page gives a note-perfect performance -- her Juno is funny, sassy, wise beyond her years, and profoundly unconventional (""Thundercats are go!""). Cera is equally good in a more subdued, lovably dorky role; it's pretty hard not to love Paulie just for being himself. And Garner and Bateman are wonderful too, as an uptight, lonely woman who desperately wants a baby, and a Peter Pan type who doesn't want to act like a grown-up. Bleah, who needs him?""Juno"" has its flaws -- moments of excessive preciousness -- but it has plenty of heart, wicked dialogue, and excellent acting.

Allison Janney is Bren, Juno's kind and witty stepmother, who is squarely on her stepdaughter's side no matter what.  The ever-reliable character actor, J. K. Simmons, is solid as Juno's nurturing dad.  He fondly calls Juno ""Junebug,"" gives her sage advice, and makes sure that she always remembers how much he cares for her.""Juno"" is tailor-made for teenage girls; they will love the film's edgy score and will identify with this child/woman who has no idea who she is or what she wants out of life.  The performances are uniformly excellent. Ellen Page is perfect as a young lady with a big mouth and an aggressive personality who needs to grow up in a hurry.  Michael Cera is adorable as Juno's geeky boyfriend, Paulie.  Although he is academically accomplished, Paulie is ordinary looking and unsophisticated.  However, he is also sweet, unassuming, and extremely attached to Juno.  Jennifer Garner is poignant as Vanessa Loring, a childless woman who has everything money can buy, but fervently desires the one thing money can't buy--her own baby.  Jason Bateman plays Mark Loring, Vanessa's good looking but immature husband.Diablo Cody's script is reminiscent of a Gilmore Girls episode; everyone seems to have a quip suitable for every occasion.  Although the screenplay is at times too self-consciously cute, it is also original, amusing, and ultimately touching.  Juno is a nice kid who wants to do the right thing; it is refreshing to see a teenager who is so adored by her parents that she finds herself able to love others freely and altruistically.  Since the viewer cannot guess how the film will end, there is an element of suspense as well.

1117444,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000YABYLA,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","I have to admit that when I see a preview for a movie about a pregnant teenager, my first thought always goes back to conventional Lifetime TV soapers likeFifteen and PregnantandMom at Sixteen. However, director Jason Reitman (who proved to have a wry, ironic eye withThank You for Smoking) and first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody, who previously worked as a stripper and phone sex operator, have concocted a genuinely quirky, surprisingly tender dramedy that takes the clich&eacute;-ridden story idea and fleshes it out with so many recognizable idiosyncrasies and so much insightful wit that the subgenre feels reborn.The plot centers on a suburban Minneapolis sixteen-year old named Juno MacGuff, who finds herself pregnant after an experiment in chair-bound seduction with her shy classmate, a geeky, Tic-Tac-popping runner named Paulie Bleeker. Instead of focusing on dramatic confrontations with the parents or morphing into a diatribe on the right-to-life-or-choose debate, Reitman and Cody follow Juno's natural emotional impulses as she awkwardly attempts to figure out the best course of action to take. Things start to look promising when Juno finds a young upscale couple to adopt her baby - Vanessa is a controlling professional with perfectionist tendencies, while her husband Mark is an easy-going composer of commercial jingles, an aging Peter Pan-type whom Juno sees as a kindred spirit with a mutual fondness for rock music, slasher movies and comic books.What I particularly like about the movie is how it portrays Juno as someone who holds no illusion of becoming a mother and yet discovers the emotional intelligence to match her maddeningly clever smart-mouthing. In fact, I had concerns about the persistence of the slang-heavy dialogue at the outset but was relieved to find the movie settle into sharp bantering exchanges that make way for more human dimensions. As proven withLittle Miss Sunshineand Lars and the Real Girl, a perfectly compatible ensemble can make all the difference with a movie as character-rich as this one. Fortunately, the cast is terrific starting with Ellen Page's prodigious turn in the title role. As a follow-up to her knockout work inHard Candy, she is impressive in revealing a fearless vulnerability under her character's disconcerting self-possession. As Bleeker, Michael Cera nicely provides a quiet gravity in response to Juno's volatility.There is great work by J.K. Simmons as Juno's no-nonsense dad and especially Allison Janney as her acid-tongued, dog-loving stepmother (her verbal teardown of the patronizing ultrasound technician is classic). The surprise comes from the sturdy work by Jason Bateman, bringing palpable, almost wistful regret to Mark, and the gorgeous Jennifer Garner truly affecting in conveying Vanessa's unfulfilled state.

What made that book interesting is how Philip K. Dick compared his eccentric main character to a ""normal"" couple going through a divorce. In the end, one saw that sometimes ""eccentric"" is not so bad after all and that sometimes it is the ""normal"" people who are messed up the most.Going back to Juno, we have a similar setup. Juno is the eccentric teenager and some ""normal adults"" believe that she has some growing up to do.But finally, towards the end of the movie, we see that it is Juno that displays some of the more adult-like qualities.I honestly wasn't expecting too much of this movie when I first saw it (a movie about pregnancy isn't the usual ""guy"" fare), but it drew me in with its excellent characters and moral dilemmas.",5,CONFESSIONS OF A CRAP ARTIST,1239148800,"04 8, 2009",2009,1092,"['many', 'people', 'Juno', 'pregnancy', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'found', 'comparing', 'novel', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'Confessions', 'Crap', 'Artist.In', 'book', 'main', 'character', 'extremely', 'odd', 'tire-regroover', 'sunlight', 'weight', 'earth', 'hollow', 'world', 'will', 'end', 'April', '23rd', 'name', 'few', 'What', 'made', 'book', 'interesting', 'how', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'compared', 'eccentric', 'main', 'character', 'normal', 'couple', 'going', 'divorce', 'end', 'one', 'saw', 'eccentric', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'normal', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'messed', 'up', 'most.Going', 'back', 'Juno', 'have', 'similar', 'setup', 'Juno', 'eccentric', 'teenager', 'normal', 'adults', 'believe', 'growing', 'up', 'do.But', 'finally', 'end', 'movie', 'see', 'Juno', 'more', 'adult-like', 'qualities.I', 'honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'pregnancy', ""n't"", 'usual', 'guy', 'fare', 'drew', 'excellent', 'characters', 'moral', 'dilemmas']",Juno

She doesn't quite believe it when she realizes, only after an ocean of Sunny Delite and three pregnancy tests, that she IS, in fact, pregnant; her snappy conversation with the nosy and slightly-creepy pharmacist establishes, however, that she finally has accepted the reality and that now she must do something about it.Her first move is to call the person I would really style as her best friend, Leah (Olivia Thirlby), and recruit her into helping her face the problem. It helps to know that these two are actual best friends off-screen; there is undeniable ease and trust between them, and they go about working out what needs to be done. An early visit on Juno's part to an abortion clinic is, well, abortive; she runs full tilt out of the building and, with Leah's counsel, decides to find the right young childless couple looking for a baby.The manner in which this 16-year-old girl goes about such a serious matter is a joy to watch. She is initially flummoxed by the problem (""the sex was premeditated, but not the pregnancy"" she tells Leah), but once all the votes are in, she accepts complete responsibility and forges ahead. The scene where she tells her parents - a sweet, slightly daffy couple played by J. K. Simmons and Allison Janney - shows that she is willing to do whatever she has to to see that everything comes out right for all concerned. Having her best girlfriend back her up in everything is great to watch as well - as is the fact that her parents, while not happy about the situation, do not fault her for it but stand by her all the way.An earlier reviewer styled this a man-hating film, which I do not agree with. I see it more as a young girl who marches to her own drum facing a bump - you will pardon the pun - in the road of life with pragmatism, humour, and dignity; not turning on the father of the baby, but still including him in her life (if not the decision about the baby); and coming out remarkably well. Kudos for all the performances - everyone did a magnificent job, including the would-be adopters of Juno's baby, played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman (hard to think of him as grown-up, somehow).

1117453,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B000YABYLA,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[6, 8]","Juno is a film which tackles the issue of teenage pregnancy. Once teenager Juno discovers she is pregnant, she immediately tries to figure out what to do. Does she try to have an abortion, or does she keep it? Or does she give it up for adoption? The story revolves about her emotions in dealing with her pregnancy and bringing a life into the world. She tells her best friends, and seeks advice, and once she decides to give it away for adoption, meets the couple and tries to figure out if they will be the right parents for her child. While the film has heart at times, and good morals at times, over all the story's dialogue seems artificial and forced, and it seems to waver between wanting to be a drama and a comedy, and successfully being neither.Personally, the story wasn't very gripping or interesting, and part of this is due to lack of believability. Most films do not have to be realistic because they are solely based on entertaining, but if you are going to make a film about a serious issue like teen pregnancy or abortion then at least make it somewhat authentic.  Many scenes are understated, and you have to second guess whether this is how parents would really react. Consider the scene where Juno first tells her father and mother-in-law that she is pregnant. To use a word that Juno uses herself, her parents were way too ""cavalier"" about her news and her decision to have an abortion, not being riled up in the slightest and seemingly giving her the ""OK"" for it. Not only that, but she can even go to the abortion clinic alone.  Also, the scenes with Juno and her friend Paulie are way too lackadaisical, and the idea of Juno actually falling for someone who is her polar opposite and has no chemistry with is a bit ludicrous. (If so, why wasn't there any chemistry built between them in the film?)  I found Juno's character to be somewhat unbelievable as well; she has some elements of being a teenager with her smart aleck attitude and witticisms, but then she goes around being worldly and sophisticated also.The cute, hip dialogue gets little tiresome after awhile as well. Juno seems to be a film screaming ""Look how indie and hip I am!""True, Juno's being up for last year's Best Picture really set the bar for expectations. Perhaps the public ate it up.

1117456,A2IQGJFF7BBMJV,B000YABYLA,Geaux Lightly,"[2, 12]","First off, I graduated from high school six years ago, and have known many high schoolers since then, and to listen to Juno talk...who talks like this? It's really a stretch to see her as an average teenage girl.  The kids on Dawson's Creek and Clueless were more believable. But then there are tons of farcical things in this movie.  I'm a decent ways through this movie, and this high school girl strikes me as way too flippant about everything.  When she went to the abortion clinic, her reason for leaving was b/c she was annoyed by the receptionist.  She found an adopting family in the paper, she told the guy she was preggo, she told her parents...all these things occurred in short scenes.  Unless something happens that I haven't seen yet, this girl has no emotional attachment to any decision or situation she encounters.I'm not going to say this movie was uncomfortable to watch, but there was definitely enough cringe worthy scenes. For example when Jen Garner's character starts touching Juno's baby bump in the food court and starts talking to it.  And she just keeps showing up at the adoptive couple's home unannounced which is conveniently when the husband is home alone, or she calls when he's by himself, and the overt flirting. And he's just as bad talking to her about his marriage problems (he wants to be a `rock star' and the marriage is holding him back). Speaking of the couple, for them to have tried for a baby for so long, and for Jen G's character to want it so bad, it seems they would be more concerned about this flippant girl who shows no emotion.I'm on the pro-life side, but know girls who have both had their babies and had abortions. None, NONE, went through either process and remained as immature or unchanged like Juno. It's laughable.  Yes, I consider it good that she had the baby, but you know what? Not one person in this movie told her to GROW UP which is what she desperately needed to do.  Seriously, NOTHING about the process scared her?I don't know if the actors were given the space to adlib or what, but most of the dialogue was just irritating. There's nothing funny, nothing thought provoking.  The movie tries to be ""fresh"" or some other term that movie critics give to movies that are inaccurate.  Just b/c they say it, doesn't make it so. The Oscar it won was definitely a gift, and I didn't see the movie of the winner, but had EP won an Oscar, it would have been undeserved.I always say that if a movie is lauded the way this movie was or any of the ""Oscar favorites"" for the last 7 years or so, chances are I'll feel the opposite of the Academy.  Most of what comes out of Hollywood these days is nothing but pretentious, pseudo-intellectual, ""not for all you average Americans,"" and overly political junk. Prediction:  When my future kids and grandkids and pretty much anyone 50 yrs from now is looking for a thought-provoking, stimulating, classic movie, they'll be doing like we do now, watching films by Billy Wilder, Hitchcock, Kazan, Huston, and all the other classics. I really can't imagine any of the films that we are seeing today standing the test of time.  There will be a very few of the current Hollywood era films to show up on the AFI all-time list.It's finally over. Gosh.  Not worth the time I spent to watch. If you want to see a better movie dealing with unexpected pregnancy w/comedy...watch Waitress. That was awesome.  Matter of fact, I think Lifetime did a better teen pregnancy movie than this with Kirsten Dunst.Oh, and P.S.  I'm a Christian, and this is not a Christian movie.  Just b/c a movie presents a pro-life view doesn't make it Christian.

1117460,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000YABYLA,Grady Harp,"[64, 79]","Teenage pregnancy is frequently a starting point for myriad philosophical arguments: some see it as a major problem, some see it as an argument for the need of early teaching of contraceptive technique and sex education, some see it as a reason for championing abortion, and some see it as a piece of life that confronts families in both positive and negative ways.  JUNO is a beautifully written (Diablo Cody) and directed (Jason Reitman) version of unplanned pregnancy offered by a splendid ensemble cast: it is a movie that could modify the sociologic outlook of many people in a very strong fashion.Juno (Ellen Page) is sixteen and talks her best friend Bleek (Michael Cera) into having sex: the result is a surprise pregnancy that Juno shares with her girlfriend Leah (Olivia Thirley) and the store clerk Rollo (Rainn  Wilson) even before informing Bleek, a likable  kid who seems fairly flat about the situation. After discarding abortion as a viable solution,  Juno informs her father (JK Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney) of her status, and tells them she is going to complete the pregnancy and give the baby to some loving and needy barren couple.  Her parents are at first flustered by the news, but quickly  become supportive in a way that tells us many things about the durability of successful families.  With Leah's help,  Juno answers an ad for 'wanted: baby' in PennySaver and visits the Lorings (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) who desperately want a child and embrace Juno's gesture of adoption with eager excitement. The remainder of the film follows Juno as her abdomen increases in girth, finding new respect for her parents and for Bleek, and inadvertently walking in the troubled waters of the Loring's marital discord.  Without giving the story away, the ending is so tender and free of  clich&eacute;  that it allows us, the audience, to appreciate all the vigor and sensitivity and humor and warmth of Juno - an example of developing maturity that is a fresh breeze compared to the usual teenage movies.Ellen Page does indeed deliver a pitch perfect performance, but her co-stars are equally fine: Simmons and Janney break away from their usual type cast roles brilliantly, and the other members of the cast (the entire cast) flesh out this well written story with great skill.  The mixture of animated graphics and the imaginative musical score enhance the flavor of the tale.  JUNO offers an unbiased look at the topic of teenage pregnancy and wins on every level.

What do I think?I liked Juno.  It was rather light and fluffy, to be honest.  Anyone who is expecting a realistic portrayal of high school life and teen pregnancy will be greatly disappointed.  The film is a little different than what you would see in a mainstream film, but not much.  It's not edgy, it's not out there, and it is desperately trying to be hip.  Juno's dialogue made me wince, like someone who is trying to prove how ""out there"" she is with her witty quips.  A lot of the dialogue felt forced, which diminished its impact for me.  Juno's character would not date (and never have sex) with someone like Michael Cera.  More than likely he would be the best friend who really loves her while she dates a jerk.  They would never get together.  The plotline of the jock who supposedly loves Juno is silly and completely underdeveloped.  Jennifer Garner's character was contrived as well.But there are some good things about the film.  I really like Jason Bateman's performance and character.  I think he gives the best performance in the film.  Many have made hay of Juno's knowledge of music and movies outside of her age bracket, saying it's not realistic.  That isn't true.  Speaking strictly for myself, when I was a teenager, I was listening to Miles Davis, Keith Jarrett, and ELP, which weren't popular at all during that time.  I also had a friend of mine who was 7 years older than me who I hung out with.  He got me into bubblegum music, which also wasn't from my time bracket.  So this does happen, and probably a lot more than people realise.  Juno's father and stepmother were pretty decent characters, far from the caricatures that permeate indie films like this.  They were a little too pat at times (especially the father), but overall their dialogue was better than know it all Juno's.  I liked the soundtrack too.The film is not a realistic portrayal of teen pregnancy, in fact, it makes it look kind of fun and hip.  It's a typical indie film that's quirky enough so that the audience thinks they're seeing something really different, but in fact they're just seeing something that's a little different from Hollywood fare, but not much.  We're not talking hard boiled Bergman or Breillat here, just a cute film that isn't boring or tedious.

1117465,A1S1JC7LTBZAH2,B000YABYLA,Hal Jordan,"[2, 2]","Overall, this is a great film.  It's fresh, well-written, surprising, and just the sort of ""small film"" that is so difficult to get right.  Most films that take this sort of honest evaluation of typical middle-class life in the contemporary United States end up being unwatchabley pretentious or stridently political.  Juno is neither.  Rather than continue to sing its praises - which has been well done in earlier reviews - I wanted to note a couple of flaws that kept this from being a five-star film for me.  First, while I love Ellen Page and her performance makes the film, she seemed too old for the part.  Looking up her bio, she is currently 21, which would have made her about 19 when Juno was filmed.  The character is supposed to be 16, which is a crucial plot point.  A key to the film is that Juno is precocious and very young - not just a high schooler, but a young high schooler.  In watching the film, I didn't buy for a minute that Ellen Page was 16; if anything I thought she was in her early 20s, or older than she actually was.  I'm sure the producers tried to find someone the correct age and were willing to tradeoff Page's brilliant performance for her being too old, but, unfortunately, this lessened the impact of the film for me.Second, [SPOILER ALERT] I thought the only real false note in the film was the ending.  I can certainly buy the idea that Juno is willing to give up the baby to the Jennifer Garner character because Juno believes that character will be a good mother to the child, despite her divorce.  But it just seems very unlikely to me that someone as sensitive and self-aware as Juno is would be so blas&eacute; about the decision - unwilling to even look at the baby in the nursery before Jennifer Garner takes him away.  This seemed particularly implausible after the film has brought Juno and her boyfriend back together and shown that she has hopes of a long-time relationship with him.  In those circumstances, not to even discuss keeping the baby?  Seems unlikely.Overall, though, this film is a must see and worthy of the acclaim it has received.",4,"Original, brilliantly written film ... with a couple of flaws",1227398400,"11 23, 2008",2008,2098,"['Overall', 'great', 'film', 'fresh', 'well-written', 'surprising', 'just', 'sort', 'small', 'film', 'so', 'difficult', 'get', 'right', 'Most', 'films', 'take', 'sort', 'honest', 'evaluation', 'typical', 'middle-class', 'life', 'contemporary', 'United', 'States', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'unwatchabley', 'pretentious', 'stridently', 'political', 'Juno', 'Rather', 'continue', 'sing', 'praises', 'been', 'well', 'done', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'wanted', 'note', 'couple', 'flaws', 'kept', 'being', 'five-star', 'film', 'First', 'love', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'performance', 'film', 'seemed', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'Looking', 'up', 'bio', 'currently', '21', 'would', 'have', 'made', '19', 'when', 'Juno', 'was', 'filmed', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', '16', 'crucial', 'plot', 'point', 'key', 'film', 'Juno', 'precocious', 'very', 'young', 'not', 'just', 'high', 'schooler', 'young', 'high', 'schooler', 'watching', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'minute', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'was', '16', 'anything', 'thought', 'was', 'early', '20s', 'older', 'actually', 'was', ""'m"", 'sure', 'producers', 'tried', 'find', 'someone', 'correct', 'age', 'were', 'willing', 'tradeoff', 'Page', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'being', 'too', 'old', 'unfortunately', 'lessened', 'impact', 'film', 'me.Second', '[', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', ']', 'thought', 'only', 'real', 'false', 'note', 'film', 'was', 'ending', 'can', 'certainly', 'buy', 'idea', 'Juno', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'baby', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'character', 'Juno', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'mother', 'child', 'divorce', 'just', 'very', 'unlikely', 'someone', 'sensitive', 'self-aware', 'Juno', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'blas', 'eacute', 'decision', 'unwilling', 'even', 'look', 'baby', 'nursery', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'away', 'seemed', 'particularly', 'implausible', 'film', 'brought', 'Juno', 'boyfriend', 'back', 'together', 'shown', 'hopes', 'long-time', 'relationship', 'circumstances', 'not', 'even', 'discuss', 'keeping', 'baby', 'Seems', 'unlikely.Overall', 'though', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'worthy', 'acclaim', 'received']",Juno

Paul Moon,"[20, 27]","This movie depressed me, for the most unexpected reason:  The critic-intelligensia and their corresponding tweeds gushed unanimous praise onto this movie, and I expect so much better from the mass of them.  The only negative reviews I could find of this film (and I was desperate to find them, to validate my dismay) were of the sadly jocular kind found here that might anyway discount the whole range of serious cinema that aspires past instant gratification.  The great irony of Juno is that it actually comes from that place, of pathological self-absorption and intoxication, when it is so easily mistaken for a drama with insightful truths.  There is no truth in Juno, starting with the billboard-sized dialogue penned by its hyped-up screenwriter Diablo Cody.  Who could have imagined that the very critical mass who would properly picket ""adult entertainment"" clubs, became so enamored of Mistress Cody's prior career as a stripper?  She has publicly boasted of the experience, and her career is unrepentantly built on it.  (Her ""big break"" was her creation of a sex blog called The Pussy Ranch.)  This purports to add chic quirk to her universe, when the truth behind the pole is that nothing but tackiness and creep go along with it.  Certainly, what it does not bespeak is an understanding of reality.And that's the whole problem with Juno, from its ridiculous dialogue to its defiant gloss over teenage pregnancy -- an event that, in real life, imposes epic emotions and consequences without exception, excepting this one big-Hollywood financed faux-independent film.  Juno is as sophisticated as a strip club wafting the scents of Budweiser and Marlboro, or in another sense, as accessibly fake as a visit to Urban Outfitters.

Whatever the reason, Juno chooses to forego an abortion and instead joins the somewhat crowded recent movie ranks (Waitress and Knocked Up) of single women in unwanted pregnancies who decide to keep the baby.  And, as with those two movies, it's a choice audiences can be glad Juno made.Funny, fast, clever and generous, Juno completely deserves its Oscar nomination for best picture.  Ellen Page, in the title role, is a big part of the reason.  Her Juno is smarter and wittier than most everyone around her -- and it's a tribute to the excellent underplaying ensemble cast that viewers understand that.  But when her scheme to have her baby adopted by a yuppy couple who advertised in the Pennysaver hits an unforeseen roadblock, Juno is sixteen again, lost as the control she has carefully and cockily imposed on her situation, herself, her parents, her boyfriend (Michael Cera, at his clueless sweet Arrested Development best) and the adopting couple threatens to unwind.  It's this blend of a child having to act like an adult, some adults acting like children, and -- occasionally -- adults acting their age that makes Juno both true and so human.

She finds a nice couple who seems great for the baby... or are they?I liked this movie.  My only complaint was the dialog.  At the beginning of this movie the characters all used language that nobody ever really uses.  It was like the script writer thought that American kids only spoke in 1337-speak and dork.  As the movie progressed this seemed to go away more and more and by the end everybody seemed to be speaking English again but then whoever wrote this forgot to go back and put everything else back into English.But everything else is great!First, this is a total character piece.  At the end of this you seem to care for everybody in this movie except for that one character could step in front of a movie bus and nobody would shed a tear.  But it seemed that everybody else was somebody who was alive that we actually could believe in, identify with, and care about and that is what made this movie fantastic.  It is much better than the usual Hollywood garbage where explosions, casual sex, and witty dialog come first and the characters are completely forgotten.The acting isn't too bad though there were some scenes where I had to check my ticket stub to make sure I hadn't landed in the sequel to Napoleon Dynamite.  Actually, it was fine because I don't think anything ever went over the top too much.  It actually made things a bit more real.I rarely mention this in my reviews because it doesn't catch my attention too often, but the music was very nice for this movie.  Not only was it nice to listen to but it seemed to fit the story extraordinarily well.  I'd love to pass some extra kudos for that.This turned out to be a great use of my time and I think most people would actually enjoy this movie.

Why? Let me explain.This movie goes with the thought of expectancy- that teenage girls this day and age don't know how to control theirselves. Rather typical. Then again, with a lack of common sense in today's academic world, that's likely to be expected. Girl finds out she's pregnant after the only time she's ever had sex (yep, that happens), and with her next-to-only friend, a rather average guy that's somewhere between a typical nerd and typical jock, yet is neither.Her parents, though they don't expect it, decide to help her... after she tries to get an abortion. Funny thing is, the one-person protest crowd outside the abortion mill (showing how popular that stance is in the general populace) has a decent conversation with Juno (likely because they know each other as acquaintances). Inside the ""clinic,"" the discomfort actually gets pretty comical with the smallest of sounds getting to Juno, along with a goth-looking front desk lady who doesn't know how to sound intelligent, but is still obnoxiously funny.So, she had the choice and chance to get an abortion, even to hear politically correct terms for an unborn child (""fetus,"" ""cluster of cells,"" ""not human yet""), yet she gets out (with the praise of that one-girl crowd), and decides to ask her friends and family for help.If anyone expects total realism and a reality check for single teen mothers, here's a reality check: this is a comedy, not a church flick, so it would likely offend a totally complacent Christian expecting seriousness or a pro-choicer (that's a given anyway).From quippy one-liners to certain camera angles, this movie does quite a bit to have some fun with real-life issues, rather than force it in your face the grotesque reality of the thigns that happen, but not all that happens in this film are cheery-go-lucky on the ""brighter"" side of the fence either.The couple that want to adopt Juno's unborn child (she doesn't want to know the kid's sex, wants it to be a surprise to herself as well as to the adoptive parents) start to have marriage issues when the ""expecting"" father suddenly isn't sure if he wants to be a parent. During the ultrasound scene, the nurse makes a clear implication of her pro-life stance and gets chewed out by Juno's stepmom- now that's pretty jaw-dropping to hear her get in defense of her ""dumb*** stepdaughter"" and actually get the nurse to apologize.And then the birthing scene (home of the only actual f-bomb in the film, and it's rather quick), where Juno experiences the labor pain. She doesn't make light of it in her acting, but shows emotional trauma, balance problems, and makes a real good show of her immense pain.Luckily, even with different forms of betrayal here and there, Juno does get the help she's been in need of, stays with her friends, has the support of her family, and helps one woman's hopeful life of being a mother happen.As a pro-lifer, I can honestly say this is one film that I've enjoyed over and over and will continue to do so, enjoying the quirky, outlandish (and at time outrageous) humor and deeply-rooted real-life issues played out every time.",5,"Decisions, decisions, OY!",1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,3278,"['should', 'state', 'first', 'pro-life', 'comedy', 'anyone', 'try', 'say', 'pro-life', 'propoganda', 'zip', 'lip-', 'ignorance', 'showing', 'Why', 'Let', 'explain.This', 'movie', 'thought', 'expectancy-', 'teenage', 'girls', 'day', 'age', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'control', 'theirselves', 'Rather', 'typical', 'Then', 'again', 'lack', 'common', 'sense', 'today', 'academic', 'world', 'likely', 'be', 'expected', 'Girl', 'out', 'pregnant', 'only', 'time', 'ever', 'had', 'sex', 'yep', 'next-to-only', 'friend', 'rather', 'average', 'guy', 'somewhere', 'typical', 'nerd', 'typical', 'jock', 'neither.Her', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'decide', 'help', 'get', 'abortion', 'Funny', 'thing', 'one-person', 'protest', 'crowd', 'abortion', 'mill', 'showing', 'how', 'popular', 'stance', 'general', 'populace', 'decent', 'conversation', 'Juno', 'likely', 'know', 'other', 'acquaintances', 'clinic', 'discomfort', 'actually', 'pretty', 'comical', 'smallest', 'sounds', 'getting', 'Juno', 'goth-looking', 'front', 'desk', 'lady', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'sound', 'intelligent', 'still', 'obnoxiously', 'funny.So', 'had', 'choice', 'chance', 'get', 'abortion', 'even', 'hear', 'politically', 'correct', 'terms', 'unborn', 'child', 'fetus', 'cluster', 'cells', 'not', 'human', 'yet', 'yet', 'out', 'praise', 'one-girl', 'crowd', 'ask', 'friends', 'family', 'help.If', 'anyone', 'total', 'realism', 'reality', 'check', 'single', 'teen', 'mothers', 'here', 'reality', 'check', 'comedy', 'not', 'church', 'flick', 'would', 'likely', 'offend', 'totally', 'complacent', 'Christian', 'expecting', 'seriousness', 'pro-choicer', 'given', 'anyway', 'quippy', 'one-liners', 'certain', 'camera', 'angles', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'have', 'fun', 'real-life', 'issues', 'rather', 'force', 'face', 'grotesque', 'reality', 'thigns', 'happen', 'not', 'film', 'are', 'cheery-go-lucky', 'brighter', 'side', 'fence', 'either.The', 'couple', 'want', 'adopt', 'Juno', 'unborn', 'child', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'kid', 'sex', 'be', 'surprise', 'herself', 'as', 'well', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'start', 'have', 'marriage', 'issues', 'when', 'expecting', 'father', 'suddenly', ""n't"", 'sure', 'be', 'parent', 'ultrasound', 'scene', 'nurse', 'clear', 'implication', 'pro-life', 'stance', 'chewed', 'out', 'Juno', 'stepmom-', 'now', 'pretty', 'jaw-dropping', 'hear', 'get', 'defense', 'dumb***', 'stepdaughter', 'actually', 'get', 'nurse', 'apologize.And', 'then', 'birthing', 'scene', 'home', 'only', 'actual', 'f-bomb', 'film', 'rather', 'quick', 'where', 'Juno', 'labor', 'pain', ""n't"", 'make', 'light', 'acting', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'balance', 'problems', 'real', 'good', 'show', 'immense', 'pain.Luckily', 'even', 'different', 'forms', 'betrayal', 'here', 'there', 'Juno', 'get', 'help', 'been', 'need', 'stays', 'friends', 'support', 'family', 'one', 'woman', 'hopeful', 'life', 'being', 'mother', 'happen.As', 'pro-lifer', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'one', 'film', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'enjoying', 'quirky', 'outlandish', 'time', 'outrageous', 'humor', 'deeply-rooted', 'real-life', 'issues', 'played', 'out', 'time']",Juno

Rusovich,"[3, 3]","Without spoilers, the story follows a 9 month journey through an accidental pregnancy of a 16-year old high school student, who ultimately decides to follow her pregnancy to term.The fact that this decision is tied to a negative exchange with a gothic receptionist at an abortion clinic is a tad flimsy, but she nevertheless concedes that she's not ready to assume the responsibilities of motherhood. With this in mind, she finds an appropriately ""cool"" older couple interested in adopting, through an ad in a local newspaper.But this is merely the sketch. The real story lies just beneath the surface.The film is fundamentally a celebration of the power of youth. Juno conceives a child that is biologically out of reach to an adopting, older couple. This is further punctuated by her cavalier references to the ""thing"" in her stomach, as though it were a new toy in the window of FAO Swartz; something taken for granted by a kid too young to appreciate her station in life.Then the woman's husband discovers a connection [love interest] with Juno he never had with his wife, which is born out of a kind of arrested adolescence, coupled with a wife whose pathological obsession with having a child eclipses her connection with him. Finally, Juno discovers real love [can't tell you where] in spite of her precarious spontaneity, unfiltered insightfulness, and complete lack of boundaries.I found it ironic that the key to the dreams of all the adults rested with a sixteen year old girl. Even her mother's love of dogs was placed on hold until Juno grew up and out of the house [Juno is allergic to ""dog saliva""]. But while this irony is compelling, Juno is one extraordinary teenager...and not in the sense that I'm used to seeing in anyone that age.Her edgy, cavalier and distinctly adult dialog felt more like the hand of the screenwriter, which would place her character in a much older category. I also found the relationship with her parents to be superficial, given the circumstances. The fact that they accepted her pregnancy as a matter of course was a little farfetched, which tended to leave reality in the lurch.In view of this, I allowed my willing suspension of disbelief to flow freely as I enjoyed the solid acting and good story line.In the end, however, I could feel the screenwriter's hand throughout every scene in the film, which left me a tad indignant towards a leading character that was just too far beyond her years.Diablo Cody is the author of the bestseller, Candy Girl.

If I'd seen it on Lifetime Movie Network, I might say it was better than average. But a 2007 Oscar nominee for Best Picture? You've got to be kidding! I would be far more forgiving of Juno's flaws had I not been subjected to the overblown hype surrounding this movie.  Now I feel obligated to knock it down a few notches.  How it got nominated over much more deserving films (like Sean Penn's ""Into the Wild"") is a testament to the genius of the marketing and PR folks.Juno (Ellen Page) is a sarcastic, precocious 16-year-old who graciously humors the clueless adults in her life. She finds herself accidentally pregnant by a friend (Michael Sera) she seduces for apparently for no other reason than idle curiosity.  If she's as smart and mature as we're supposed to believe she is, how come she's never heard of birth control?  And why aren't her parents upset?  The dialogue is reminiscent of a sit-com: rapid-fire, oh-so-witty, full of hip pop-culture references... in other words, totally unbelievable.  In one scene Juno name-drops Soupy Sales, yet in another reveals she has never heard of Bob Marley.  Oh please! The exchanges between Juno and her best friend are particularly unrealistic and annoying. I wonder how many real teenage girls crack one-liners during the ""Oh my god I'm pregnant!"" conversation.  The most believable character is Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), the would-be adoptive mom.  There are shades of gray in her portrayal, and thankfully, she did not have to read lines of dialogue that sound sound like they belong on 30 Rock.Juno is amusing enough though, to keep the viewer entertained till the end.  But that is the extent of it's value.  The outcome is predictable, the relationships all tidied up in a feel-good way, and the teachable moments, though lacking preachyness, are clich&eacute;d.

The main character learns about life. There are no perfect couples and life is complex. My biggest problem is the baby. Juno had sex because she was curious and she was bored. I don't understand why they didn't have protected sex. She planned the encounter for months and she obviously knew better. They didn't have sex in the throes of passion. They had sex because they were curious.We follow the pregnancy's development. Juno through it all never forms an attachment to the baby. She objectifies it. She decides not to have an abortion because she was uncomfortable in the clinic and didn't like the staff. She decides to give up the baby for adoption.In the end there are no consequences. She is the same strange, sweet girl at the end of the movie as she is at the start of the movie. The baby is completely out her life as if nothing happened. Her father says to her at the hospital after Juno gives birth that one day she will be there on her own terms. I don't understand. She made every decision to get there in the first place. It was on her own terms. Maybe, he meant that the next pregnancy will be planned and she will want the baby. She seems depressed after the birth, but no moral misgivings and no post-partem depression. The baby is almost a Hitchcockian McGuffin.

Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[1, 1]","Juno extends beyond cheap comedy and wired lines of dialogue and becomes a movie that touches you deeper than your layer of skin. I didn't think so at first, and many think so, but this movie grew on me and I ended up liking this movie in the end. Jennifer Garner gave a surprisingly good performance and Ellen Page was perfect and not just because she's a fresh face. I don't suppose too many can walk the line of innocence and ironic baseness, and Ellen walks that quirky line throughout. The movie also has that same discription: a sort of quirky genius to it that is fresh and straight out of left field. I've read that today's audience screams for change. That we are in a transitional phase, and that the continued, surprising success of the very different film Juno, sort of is a calling card of this generation. It's a pivotal movie and its overrecognition must be credited to that! I adore this film and I do not believe my own statement above of being overrecognized, but it's what I must use to describe the number of nominations this movie has been attached with.

1117491,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B000YABYLA,Jem,"[2, 3]","I think all the media stories, Oscar buzz, interviews, and hype set the bar on this movie so high I couldn't help but be disappointed.  When I saw previews and commercials for it, my first thought was ""they put all the funny clips into those spots"".  And I wasn't completely wrong.  There were a few other funny scenes, most notably with Allison Janney, but the rest of the movie was kinda slow.After one night of unprotected sex, Juno discovers she's pregnant.  She goes for an abortion, but can't bring herself to go through with it.  She finds an ad in the paper for adoptive parents and decides to give the baby up.  From that point, viewers jump from scene to scene as Juno's pregnancy progresses.  Kids at school stare; she has an ultrasound (a very good scene wherein Janney tells the technician off for being judgmental); she visits the adoptive parents; she hangs out; etc.  Unfortunately, with the notable exception of Juno herself, all the other characters are VERY two-dimensional.  The boyfriend is a bit of a nerd who doesn't have a lot to say.  Juno's best friend is a ditz who's got a crush on a teacher.  And ALL the kids speak with the  stereotypical ""these are teens, they have their own jargon"" crap.  At one point I was tempted to start the movie over just so I could count the number of times they say ""dude.""  I know that teens do have a lot of common idioms they use, but this felt like I was watching ""That 70's Show."" (the visual art direction of the film reinforced this as well). I think Juno was supposed to come off as very mature (or wise) in her worldview, but at the same time she had unprotected sex and chose adoptive parents out of the newspaper.  JK Simmons was wasted in his part and could've offered more to the movie as a supportive but disappointed dad.  Same for Allison Janney.  Of course, the perfect couple who wants to adopt is only perfect on paper. I think this was meant to be a source of conflict for the movie, but just didn't measure up.  Viewers are supposed to feel some pity, I think, for the husband who obviously has no common interests with his wife, is being rushed into fatherhood, and never got to pursue his dreams.  All I could do was agree with his wife, ""grow up.""  She wasn't even two-dimensional - successful business woman who wants a baby, that's it.  Since the couple is a such minor piece of the movie, it didn't matter that much.However, the film wasn't all bad.  It had a good message, showing the very real and negative side of teen pregnancy, physical as well as psychological.  And I like how they emphasized how many people are desperate to adopt because they can't have children of their own.  Yet, the film managed to avoid being a moral indictment.  She made a mistake, but dealt with the consequences as best she could.  Juno is a very likeable and spunky character that made this movie better than it would've been.  Ellen Paige deserves kudos for her acting, but the screenplay didn't deserve all those accolades.  There were some very funny scenes and the ending was well done.  Yet, this didn't succeed as a comedy. And, I don't think it succeeded as a look into a teen's life (likeThirteen).  Overall, I think it would have been better as a made-for-tv movie.  It was worth seeing, but I'm glad I didn't buy it.",3,"3.5 Stars, too much hype...",1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,3297,"['think', 'media', 'stories', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'interviews', 'hype', 'set', 'bar', 'movie', 'so', 'high', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'disappointed', 'When', 'saw', 'previews', 'commercials', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'put', 'funny', 'clips', 'spots', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'wrong', 'were', 'few', 'other', 'funny', 'scenes', 'most', 'notably', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'kinda', 'slow.After', 'one', 'night', 'unprotected', 'sex', 'Juno', 'pregnant', 'abortion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'go', 'ad', 'paper', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'decides', 'give', 'baby', 'up', 'point', 'viewers', 'jump', 'scene', 'scene', 'Juno', 'pregnancy', 'Kids', 'school', 'stare', 'ultrasound', 'very', 'good', 'scene', 'wherein', 'Janney', 'technician', 'off', 'being', 'judgmental', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'out', 'etc', 'Unfortunately', 'notable', 'exception', 'Juno', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'VERY', 'two-dimensional', 'boyfriend', 'bit', 'nerd', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'say', 'Juno', 'best', 'friend', 'ditz', 'who', 'got', 'crush', 'teacher', 'kids', 'speak', 'stereotypical', 'are', 'teens', 'have', 'own', 'jargon', 'crap', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'tempted', 'start', 'movie', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'count', 'number', 'times', 'say', 'dude', 'know', 'teens', 'do', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'idioms', 'use', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', '70', 'Show', 'visual', 'art', 'direction', 'film', 'reinforced', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'Juno', 'was', 'supposed', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'mature', 'wise', 'worldview', 'same', 'time', 'had', 'unprotected', 'sex', 'chose', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'newspaper', 'JK', 'Simmons', 'was', 'wasted', 'part', 'could', ""'ve"", 'offered', 'more', 'movie', 'supportive', 'disappointed', 'dad', 'Same', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'course', 'perfect', 'couple', 'who', 'adopt', 'only', 'perfect', 'paper', 'think', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'source', 'conflict', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'Viewers', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'pity', 'think', 'husband', 'who', 'obviously', 'common', 'interests', 'wife', 'being', 'rushed', 'fatherhood', 'never', 'got', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'agree', 'wife', 'grow', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'two-dimensional', 'successful', 'business', 'woman', 'who', 'baby', 'couple', 'such', 'minor', 'piece', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much.However', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'had', 'good', 'message', 'showing', 'very', 'real', 'negative', 'side', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'physical', 'as', 'well', 'psychological', 'like', 'how', 'emphasized', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'desperate', 'adopt', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'children', 'own', 'film', 'managed', 'avoid', 'being', 'moral', 'indictment', 'made', 'mistake', 'consequences', 'best', 'could', 'Juno', 'very', 'likeable', 'spunky', 'character', 'made', 'movie', 'better', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Ellen', 'Paige', 'kudos', 'acting', 'screenplay', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'accolades', 'were', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'ending', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'succeeded', 'look', 'teen', 'life', 'likeThirteen', 'Overall', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'made-for-tv', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy']",Juno

Along with the great filmBrick, Juno is probably THE best independent film ever made (well, at least that I've seen).The story starts out with Juno, a likable, sarcastic, awkward high school teen who has just discovered that she is pregnant. She decides, instead of having an abortion, to have the baby and give it up for adoption once it's born. She is far and away the best part of this film. The plot may be a little reminiscent ofKnocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)but it doesn't rely on cheep comedy to drive film forward; instead it utilizes its extremely likable and believable characters in a way which sets this film above most others of its kind. Juno, her father, step mother, boyfriend, best friend, they all play a critical role in the film and present viewers with a realistic portrayal of everyday American life in a small town with nothing to do. Despite their obvious problems and character flaws, despite Juno's flippant remarks like calling her baby a ""sea monkey"" that she ""needs to let cook in the oven (her womb) a little longer"" before she can give it to the adoptive parents, they just become more and more likable as the film progresses. The relationships that are developed and elaborated upon during the film, in their subtle ways, build tension better than any action movie could ever do.If there is a movie in 2007 without a flaw, that film will be Juno. Not only one of the most quotable films I've ever seen, but one which captures the atmosphere of small town conflicts in a most realistic manner. Do not go into this film looking for deep hidden messages, unique film techniques, or dramatic over acting; simply enjoy it for what it is, a slice of life in a small town.

Juno (not the town in Alaska) is a story about a teenage girl going through the process of an unplanned pregnancy. Not being able to go through with an abortion, Juno seeks out an alternative means...""adoption"" but on her own terms. There she seeks out and finds the Lorings (Jason Bateman, Jenifer Garner) as the quintessential parents. The Lorings are a well to do(very yuppie), upper class couple who are childless and have been unsucessful in having there own children. Vanessa Loring (either unable to have a baby or not wanting to endure pregnancy-I wasn't sure which at first?) deeply, madly, desperately wants to have a family and be a mother. So, over the next several months, Juno goes through the motions and growing pains of pregnancy, all the while coming to terms and to her own realizations of motherhood,couples and relationships. Juno ponders on finding that one person who will love you no matter what, and not put into more simpler terms other than, ""pretty,ugly,thin,fat,handsome,no matter what...the right person will think the sun still shines out of your ass"" put so eloquently by her dear old d,a,d. I really enjoyed this film. I loved Juno's off color,dry and quirky sense of humor and especially her insight (from a girls perspective).Ellen Page is also turning out to be a great actress, plus...she's pretty damm cute to boot and perfectly cast as the main character. Well worth watching and owning, Juno is one of those rare gems (especially being a teen targeted film) that actually has quite a bit of substance to it rather than pointless,shallower, more intelligence draining teen films made in the past.

1117504,A10872FHIJAKKD,B000YABYLA,Just Bill,"[4, 7]","My wife and I loved this movie so much we subsequently saw it three more times, the fourth time with me sitting in the theater with the Shooting Script book in one hand, and my cell phone in the other to illuminate its pages. I'd watch/listen to the movie, and scribble in the script where the movie on screen differed from what was written. (For the record, the movie is about 40% different from what appears in the Shooting Script.) I did that because I'm a budding screenwriter myself and I wanted to understand how this superb movie was created. So I took it apart the way someone would disassemble a watch or a car engine, examining every part to see why the whole worked so well.In the end, what I concluded is that Juno is the perfect marriage of a well-crafted script by Diablo Cody, brilliant directing by Jason Reitman, and sublime acting by everyone, but especially Ellen Page, Michael Cera, and Jason Bateman. This is how Hollywood *should* work -- with no one aspect of the film process dominating another.I don't know what to say about Juno that hasn't already been noted in all these reviews. You know what the story is about: a 16-year-old who gets pregnant, decides to keep the baby and put it up for adoption, and what happens to her life given her decision. Ellen Page deserved the Oscar for her performance, but an Oscar nomination is equally as impressive for an actress who just turned 21.Yet, if you want to see a study in absolutely sublime acting, watch Michael Cera, who plays her boyfriend Paulie Bleeker. His mannerisms, facial expressions, and dialog delivery are so totally spot-on that he doesn't appear to be acting at all. He truly looks like Paulie Bleeker, a high-school student who discovers his girlfriend is pregnant.The reason why Juno received so much attention (including a well-deserved Oscar win for screenwriter Diablo Cody) is because this is the freshest, most intelligent, most endearing movie to come along in decades. There's nothing not to love about Juno. Even the quirky soundtrack is perfect. (And I bought it the minute it was released.)Juno is now nestled in my all-time Top Five movies. True, it's not as ""important"" as Casablanca, Chinatown, The Godfather, or even When Harry Met Sally. But it represents what I hope is a new level of excellence to which Hollywood should aspire. This is a very funny, heartwarming movie that bears up to many repeated viewings. (Try that with 75% of the movies Hollywood releases each year.)Lest you think I'm a Juno fanboy (which I am), I will admit this slight criticism of the movie: at times, the dialog is too witty and too quick to come from the mouth of a 16 year old. At times, Juno seems so precocious that you just know she's reading lines. Yet, that can be forgiven with a movie as good as this because the story is just so darn good.I absolutely, totally, unabashedly love this movie.",5,"A PERFECT ""10,"" JUNO IS A WITTY, WELL-CRAFTED, SUPERBLY ACTED DELIGHT FROM START TO FINISH",1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,2887,"['wife', 'loved', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'subsequently', 'saw', 'three', 'more', 'times', 'fourth', 'time', 'sitting', 'theater', 'Shooting', 'Script', 'book', 'one', 'hand', 'cell', 'phone', 'other', 'illuminate', 'pages', ""'d"", 'watch/listen', 'movie', 'scribble', 'script', 'where', 'movie', 'screen', 'differed', 'what', 'was', 'written', 'record', 'movie', 'about', '40', '%', 'different', 'what', 'Shooting', 'Script', 'did', ""'m"", 'budding', 'screenwriter', 'wanted', 'understand', 'how', 'superb', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'took', 'apart', 'way', 'someone', 'would', 'disassemble', 'watch', 'car', 'engine', 'examining', 'part', 'see', 'why', 'whole', 'worked', 'so', 'end', 'what', 'concluded', 'Juno', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'well-crafted', 'script', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'brilliant', 'directing', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'sublime', 'acting', 'everyone', 'especially', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'how', 'Hollywood', '*should*', 'work', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'process', 'dominating', 'another.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'Juno', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'noted', 'reviews', 'know', 'what', 'story', '16-year-old', 'who', 'pregnant', 'keep', 'baby', 'put', 'up', 'adoption', 'what', 'life', 'given', 'decision', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'equally', 'impressive', 'actress', 'who', 'just', 'turned', '21.Yet', 'want', 'see', 'study', 'absolutely', 'sublime', 'acting', 'watch', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'Paulie', 'Bleeker', 'mannerisms', 'facial', 'expressions', 'dialog', 'delivery', 'are', 'so', 'totally', 'spot-on', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'acting', 'truly', 'Paulie', 'Bleeker', 'high-school', 'student', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'pregnant.The', 'reason', 'why', 'Juno', 'received', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'including', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'win', 'screenwriter', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'freshest', 'most', 'intelligent', 'most', 'endearing', 'movie', 'come', 'along', 'decades', 'nothing', 'not', 'love', 'Juno', 'Even', 'quirky', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'bought', 'minute', 'was', 'released', 'Juno', 'now', 'nestled', 'all-time', 'Top', 'Five', 'movies', 'True', 'not', 'important', 'Casablanca', 'Chinatown', 'Godfather', 'even', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'what', 'hope', 'new', 'level', 'excellence', 'Hollywood', 'should', 'aspire', 'very', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'many', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Try', '75', '%', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'releases', 'year', 'Lest', 'think', ""'m"", 'Juno', 'fanboy', 'am', 'will', 'admit', 'slight', 'criticism', 'movie', 'times', 'dialog', 'too', 'witty', 'too', 'quick', 'come', 'mouth', '16', 'year', 'old', 'times', 'Juno', 'so', 'precocious', 'just', 'know', 'reading', 'lines', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'story', 'just', 'so', 'darn', 'good.I', 'absolutely', 'totally', 'unabashedly', 'love', 'movie']",Juno

I heard it was really good.""  I had no idea what it was about.  As the movie started, a 16-year old girl was talking about how she had had sex in a chair with this boy and I though, ""Oh my God!  What have I done!""  Well, the movie was quite good, indeed.I believe Juno had sex one time with this boy from school who was about the same age, and, as we all know is quite possible, she got pregnant.  The movie takes you through the whole pregnancy:  how Juno's life changed throughout the pregnancy, decisions she had to make, how she told her parents, should they get married, should she have an abortion, should she keep the baby, should she put it up for adoption? and so many other related issues.  The movie delt with a very serious subject matter, but it did it well and in a non-judgemental way.  There was quite a bit of humor in the movie, but the humor did not diminish the seriousness of the subject.I was really surprised at how good this movie was.  The theater was loaded with teenagers, some with their boyfriends.  I like to hope that they all got a better appreciation of the responsibilities that come with sex from the movie that teens are not necessarily ready for.  Judging from the audience's reactions, I think it made them all think.  No one left making goofy remarks and laughing.

1117509,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000YABYLA,K. Driscoll,"[1, 3]","I wanted to hate Juno so bad.  I suppose all of the trendy dialogue and often unnecessary indie credibility made me want to target this as among the most overrated films of 2007.  In retrospect I hate when I have preconceptions going into a film but at least here I can admit its impact.  Juno isn't overrated at all and although the dialogue is still hard to believe in flashes; the characters were compelling, enjoyable, and very easy to like.  It was a simple task to forgive the few flaws I expected to find.The film is directed by Jason Reitman (Thank You for Smoking), the son of director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters).  It is written by Diablo Cody, a known blogger who won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay for Juno.  The film's cast is actually very deep for its modest budget of $7 million dollars.  The cast includes Ellen Page in the title role, Michael Cera as her quasi-boyfriend and father-to-be, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as the would-be adoptive parents of Juno's daughter, and J.K. Simmons as Juno's father, among others.  It always surprises me when J.K. Simmons appears in a role as a nice guy after seeing him play an imprisoned Aryan gang leader for years onOzand the fiery J. Jonah Jameson in theSpider-Man movies.  He is always an outstanding supporting actor.Juno follows a young girl named Juno MacGuff (Page) who discovers she is pregnant.  The film looks the issue of abortion right in the face, for better or worse, seemingly indifferent to the views of either side, and eventually Juno decides she will have the child and put it up for adoption.  Mark and Vanessa Loring (Bateman and Garner) are a married thirty-something couple that want to adopt the child.  Juno's interactions with both Mark and Vanessa are engaging and surprisingly fresh.  The supporting characters are very strong and make the main characters even more enjoyable to watch.The strength of Juno's character seems to be one of the film's contentious points.

1117510,A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,B000YABYLA,Kelly Klepfer,"[1, 1]","Juno is one of the most talked about movies of the year, hailed by some, scorned by others. I had the chance to watch it a couple of days ago. Sometimes I feel the need to write a review right away, other experiences compel me to stew over what I read or watched. Juno is a stew movie.For starters, I'm going to warn cautious parents of young teenagers and tweens to view it before letting their kids loose with Juno.  This film is a typical coming of age movie in that sexuality is a very strong theme. Several sexual comments, body part comments and situations that feel inappropriate and seem headed toward  a creepy place, pepper the film. There is no overt sexual activity, but there are scenes with clothing being removed and obviously naked, strategically placed persons. Though the cussing is less than I expected, some coarse comments are made in some unexpected scenes. I believe the f-bomb appeared once as a non-verbal and once as a verbal. There are other smatterings of language that are pretty low-key. The screenwriters apparently believe the statement...""cussing shows you lack creativity.""That said, I can now tell you what I loved about the film. The characters are quirky, engaging and people I would likely grow to call friends. Juno plays fragile/tough/transparent and naive all in the typical adolescent roller coaster. She's creative, cynical and fresh.  I loved Juno's sarcastic, dry dad and her off-the-wall stepmother. The family, dysfunctional in a loving and bizarrely respectful way, works and radiates a borderline healthy relationship. Juno's confidence and convictions are innocent and sweet and make her character multi-dimensional in all the right ways. Her support system is a delight to watch as they help her through things that are, as stated by Juno, way beyond her maturity level.Juno's opening credits are creative, a blend of reality and animation that gives a hint that the filmmakers will deliver a visually satisfying film. They do. The dialogue is fabulous. Fans of Napoleon Dynamite might want to check out this meatier, edgier slice of cinema. Fans of Dan in Real Life will probably find much to like in the characters interactions. If you like to laugh and tear up within the same movie, check out Juno.",5,"Angst, Drama, Hilarity, Charm....",1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,2253,"['Juno', 'one', 'most', 'talked', 'movies', 'year', 'hailed', 'scorned', 'others', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'Sometimes', 'feel', 'need', 'write', 'review', 'right', 'away', 'other', 'experiences', 'compel', 'stew', 'what', 'read', 'watched', 'Juno', 'stew', 'movie.For', 'starters', ""'m"", 'going', 'warn', 'cautious', 'parents', 'young', 'teenagers', 'tweens', 'view', 'letting', 'kids', 'loose', 'Juno', 'film', 'typical', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'sexuality', 'very', 'strong', 'theme', 'Several', 'sexual', 'comments', 'body', 'part', 'comments', 'situations', 'feel', 'inappropriate', 'seem', 'headed', 'creepy', 'place', 'film', 'overt', 'sexual', 'activity', 'are', 'scenes', 'clothing', 'being', 'removed', 'obviously', 'naked', 'strategically', 'placed', 'persons', 'cussing', 'less', 'expected', 'coarse', 'comments', 'are', 'made', 'unexpected', 'scenes', 'believe', 'f-bomb', 'appeared', 'once', 'non-verbal', 'once', 'verbal', 'are', 'other', 'smatterings', 'language', 'are', 'pretty', 'low-key', 'screenwriters', 'apparently', 'believe', 'statement', 'cussing', 'shows', 'lack', 'creativity', 'said', 'can', 'now', 'tell', 'what', 'loved', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'quirky', 'engaging', 'people', 'would', 'likely', 'grow', 'call', 'friends', 'Juno', 'fragile/tough/transparent', 'naive', 'typical', 'adolescent', 'roller', 'coaster', 'creative', 'cynical', 'fresh', 'loved', 'Juno', 'sarcastic', 'dry', 'dad', 'off-the-wall', 'stepmother', 'family', 'dysfunctional', 'loving', 'bizarrely', 'respectful', 'way', 'works', 'borderline', 'healthy', 'relationship', 'Juno', 'confidence', 'convictions', 'are', 'innocent', 'sweet', 'make', 'character', 'multi-dimensional', 'right', 'ways', 'support', 'system', 'delight', 'watch', 'help', 'things', 'are', 'stated', 'Juno', 'way', 'maturity', 'level.Juno', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'creative', 'blend', 'reality', 'animation', 'hint', 'filmmakers', 'will', 'deliver', 'visually', 'satisfying', 'film', 'do', 'dialogue', 'fabulous', 'Fans', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'meatier', 'edgier', 'slice', 'cinema', 'Fans', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'much', 'like', 'characters', 'interactions', 'like', 'laugh', 'tear', 'up', 'same', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'Juno']",Juno

Every time I've seen it, I'm all ""faklempt"" (meaning emotional or choked up for any non-yiddish, speakers out there) by the time the end titles roll. Call me a wimp or a weenie, but this movie gets me every time I see it. But isn't that, what the best movies do? Move something in you, get to your emotions. That was certainly my reaction to ""Juno"". You can argue the point, but I think that this little, low budget, indie-style comedy was one of the best movies of 2007.""Juno"" is the comedy/drama story of Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), a precocious, cocky, wise-cracking teenager, who suddenly finds herself pregnant, after sexually experimenting with her best friend Paulie (Michael Cera). After being put off by a visit to an abortion clinic, Juno answers an ad in the local 'Penny Saver' newspaper for 'adoptive parents'. They turn out to be Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) & Mark Loring (Jason Bateman) a yuppy-ish, childless couple, who have plenty of issues of their own. During the course of the film, we follow the next several months of Juno's life as a pregnant teen and her relationships with her parents, Paulie and the Lorings. What starts off as a very funny, screwball-ish, alternative comedy, eventually evolves into an emotional story, where Juno must find out, that she dosn't have all the answers. The last thirty-some weeks are not just a mere inconvienance, that will soon be forgotten. In the end, Juno must learn to ""grow-up real fast"", all while finding out the true meaning of love.Don't be put off, if the above plot synoposis sounds a little too much like an old 'ABC After School Special'. This is as far from the standard, Hollywood mush as you can get. First time screen writer, Diablo Cody and Director Jason Reitman have joined forces with a brillaint cast to create an imaginative, smart, well-written film, which is both funny and moving at the same time.I love the fact, that the script dosn't treat the characters or the audience like there a bunch of dummies. When was the last time a Hollywood film about teen pregnancy didn't make the parents out as a bunch of clueless, overeacting, yelling idiots, the teen father-to-be as a jerk or even wealthy yuppies to be one dimensional. Instead, this film very subtlety reveals different layers of these characters. You get to know these people and find out what makes them tick.Ellen Page as the film's title character is just wonderful. Page gives so much nuance in her performance. Just watch the emotions, that run across her face, when she is forced to reveal she's pregnant to her parents. She put in one of the best performances of the year. Hopefully this young actress will have a brillaint career ahead of her. The rest of the cast is equally good, showcasing stand-out performances from J.K. Simmons, Alison Janney, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and Michael Cera.Finally, mention should also be made of the film's energetic music soundtrack, that features the works of anti-folkie, Kimya Dawson, British  alt-rockers, Belle & Sebastion and other various artists. These songs will get stuck in your head and keep you humming for days.This is a great movie, which has its' fill of both big laughs and tears.

1117514,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000YABYLA,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 3]","Writer Diablo Cody has managed to take a very serious topic, teen pregnancy, and successfully blend it with humor, innocence and a bit of fear to make a wonderful film:  ""Juno.""Some believe that this film champions the ideals of the pro-choice crowd.  Others see it as a movie that highlights the positive aspects of choosing life instead of abortion.  What I see is a film about a young girl who is attempting to rationalize the severity of her situation with a mind that is still in its formative years.Ellen Page stars as Juno McGuff, a teen who has just found out that she is pregnant for her good friend, Bleeker (Michael Cera).  On a whim (at least as Juno sees it), the pair have sex and now they have to deal with its consequences.  Instead of that happening, though, Juno pretty much keeps Bleeker in the dark about the entire situation.  He approaches the situation with confusion and innocence.  She tries to work through it with sarcasm and wit.Eventually, Juno finds an adoptive family for her child through the Penny Saver paper.  Enter Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), a couple looking for their first child after many failed attempts.  Vanessa is hungry to be a mother while Mark is a little hesitant about becoming a dad.Once the legalities of the adoption are set, the rest of the film follows Juno through the ups and downs of being a pregnant teen and how her relationships with others are affected.  She deals with being stared at by classmates and sneered at by school staff.  Her relationship with Bleeker takes a few detours.  She bonds with Mark through music and with Vanessa through motherhood.  She also strengthens the bond with her father and step mother.  A twist is thrown late in the film to add a little drama to the story, but it fits perfectly.What you have in the end is a film that deals with teen pregnancy with well-placed humor and just the right amount of tenderness.  The cast, for the most part, is brilliant.  J.K. Simmons as Juno's father does a brilliant job.  He perfectly evokes a father's disappointment, confusion, fear and eventual pride and joy for his daughter.  Allison Janney plays Juno's step mother.  She shows how much a person tries to make a connection with their step child by protecting Juno.  Page can be a bit over-the-top at times, but she does a solid enough job to never make me lose interest in her character.  Cera does an excellent job of showing the uncertainty in Bleeker.  His character develops wonderfully as the story goes along.  Bateman turns in an impressive performance as Mark, a man approaching middle-age and still hanging on to the past.  While Garner does a fine job as Vanessa, I felt at times that she was pushing the emotional envelope a bit too much.  Her character seems to have this picture perfect (and somewhat Utopian)idea of what it's like to be a mother, but she also shows emotions that I find would be more likely to be found in a woman who is actually pregnant.  Still, this is the only shortfall in the cast and is forgivable thanks to the overall strength of the rest of the cast and the film as a whole.I must point out that the music is pretty good, but a few of the songs rake the nerves.  If you like your music with a bit of a folk tinge to it or happen to be a regular listener of NPR, you'll probably love the soundtrack.  If your tastes require a bit more punch, you might be turned off by the film's music.There is a bit of strong language in the film, but nothing that your average child over the age of ten doesn't hear in the store every day.  The sexuality in the movie is dealt with briefly and with humorous teen confusion, and there is no nudity.  On a positive note, Juno's family has a strong bond, which is especially important in dealing with a teen pregnancy.  Her father and step mother give her strong support throughout the film.If you're looking for a light comedy/drama that deals with a very heavy subject, I highly recommend ""Juno.""  I initially thought that this film would be a bust considering the heavy hype it received during its theatrical release, but it has turned me into a believer.

1117517,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B000YABYLA,K. Ostrowski,"[0, 6]","This movie was an unusual case.  It's a movie about how a young, immature, teenage girl discovers she's pregnant after spontaneous sex with a young, slightly-more-mature, teenage boy, and how she copes with it.  She contemplates abortion at first, but ultimately, chooses adoption instead.  It amazes me that the movie's plot can be, on the surface, so pro-life, and still not be something a good Catholic can really enjoy.I say ""on the surface"" because actually watching the movie takes work.  Juno herself is an unpleasant and unresponsible girl, with a decidedly critical and pessimistic view of the world around her, and it shows, because the movie is narrated by her inner monologue.  Still, this alone wouldn't be enough to ruin the film.  If I tried to count all the movie protagonists who start out foolish and irresponsible, and learn some important lesson by the end of the film, which turns their life around, I'd be too busy to make another review for the rest of my life.The problem is in the specifics.  You've probably heard that this movie contains profanity.  That's a whopping big understatement if I ever heard one.  This may be one of the most vulgar films I've ever seen, and as of right now, it's proof that they'll never give a movie an R rating for cursing alone.  I usually don't mind a little cursing in movies for the sake of realism, but this didn't feel realistic at all.  It felt over-the-top.  Maybe that was intentional.  Maybe they were trying to get a laugh that way.  I don't know.  I just know it didn't make me laugh.  The cover of the DVD claims that it's a comedy, but I didn't laugh once, at any point during the film, which is not a good sign.This movie, to its credit, tries to tackle all the hard sexual subjects of today; teen pregnancy, abortion, divorce, and so forth, but through it all, there's no real talk of honor or ethics, much less religion, and it seems to arrive at only about half the answers to the questions it poses.Nobody comes out and says ""what you did was wrong.""  There's no sense, from any of the characters, that their actions brought about consequences and they should take responsibility for them; just a mass of emotions over things like fingernails, body shape and lust.This sense of things being unfortunate, but never bad or wrong pervades the whole movie.  When Juno has sex out of wedlock, she's never told it was wrong.  When she decides against abortion, she never expresses that she thought it was wrong.  When the couple who plans to adopt her child decide to get a divorce, once again, that horrible word ""wrong"" never dares to rear its ugly head.  Even when the husband in that couple... acts unfaithfully, Juno never tells him that he's wrong to do so.  No one does.  Pish-tosh.  It just isn't done.  We don't say nasty words like that at the country club.Juno herself demonstrates many instances of poor judgment and simple bad morals early in the film, and never really seems to learn her lesson about them later.  In one instance, she expresses inner disgust over her boyfriend's mother for being overweight, and in another, makes a comment that sounds almost like a plug for gay adoption.  Bringing these things in, and failing to talk about whether they're wrong or right is simply a cop-out, and honestly, we deserve better.Ultimately, the strengths of this movie are found in the boyfriend, who, though shy and weak-willed, seems to genuinely care about Juno and want what's best for her, and in Juno herself, who gradually learns to appreciate that kind of love; the kind that involves making sacrifices.  It would be a mistake to say that these are not strengths.  They certainly are.However, the particular phrasing of the lesson that Juno learns is something like ""someone who loves you for who you really are,"" and this is a humanist moral lesson; not a Catholic one.  Love, by the Catholic definition, has nothing to do with who the person loved is, and everything to do with the person doing the loving.  It's a one-sided decision to do what is best for the other person, regardless of what kind of person they are, or how you may feel about them.Ultimately, I think that Juno might serve well to guide very self-centered people towards a better means of thinking, and as movies go, it doesn't stink, but if you're already a strong Catholic, don't waste your time on it.",3,Juno; A Catholic's Review,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,4366,"['movie', 'was', 'unusual', 'case', 'movie', 'how', 'young', 'immature', 'teenage', 'girl', 'pregnant', 'spontaneous', 'sex', 'young', 'slightly-more-mature', 'teenage', 'boy', 'how', 'abortion', 'first', 'ultimately', 'adoption', 'instead', 'movie', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'surface', 'pro-life', 'still', 'not', 'be', 'something', 'good', 'Catholic', 'can', 'really', 'enjoy.I', 'say', 'surface', 'actually', 'watching', 'movie', 'work', 'Juno', 'unpleasant', 'unresponsible', 'girl', 'decidedly', 'critical', 'pessimistic', 'view', 'world', 'movie', 'narrated', 'inner', 'monologue', 'Still', 'alone', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'enough', 'ruin', 'film', 'tried', 'count', 'movie', 'protagonists', 'who', 'start', 'foolish', 'irresponsible', 'learn', 'important', 'lesson', 'end', 'film', 'life', ""'d"", 'be', 'too', 'busy', 'make', 'review', 'rest', 'life.The', 'problem', 'specifics', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'movie', 'profanity', 'whopping', 'big', 'understatement', 'ever', 'heard', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'vulgar', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'right', 'now', 'proof', ""'ll"", 'never', 'give', 'movie', 'R', 'rating', 'cursing', 'alone', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'cursing', 'movies', 'sake', 'realism', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'realistic', 'felt', 'over-the-top', 'Maybe', 'was', 'intentional', 'Maybe', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'laugh', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'cover', 'DVD', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'once', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'good', 'sign.This', 'movie', 'credit', 'tries', 'tackle', 'hard', 'sexual', 'subjects', 'today', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'abortion', 'divorce', 'so', 'forth', 'real', 'talk', 'honor', 'ethics', 'much', 'less', 'religion', 'arrive', 'only', 'answers', 'questions', 'poses.Nobody', 'out', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'wrong', 'sense', 'characters', 'actions', 'brought', 'consequences', 'should', 'take', 'responsibility', 'just', 'mass', 'emotions', 'things', 'fingernails', 'body', 'shape', 'lust.This', 'sense', 'things', 'being', 'unfortunate', 'never', 'bad', 'wrong', 'whole', 'movie', 'When', 'Juno', 'sex', 'wedlock', 'never', 'told', 'was', 'wrong', 'When', 'abortion', 'never', 'thought', 'was', 'wrong', 'When', 'couple', 'who', 'adopt', 'child', 'decide', 'get', 'divorce', 'once', 'again', 'horrible', 'word', 'wrong', 'never', 'rear', 'ugly', 'head', 'Even', 'when', 'husband', 'couple', 'unfaithfully', 'Juno', 'never', 'wrong', 'do', 'so', 'one', 'Pish-tosh', 'just', ""n't"", 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'nasty', 'words', 'country', 'club.Juno', 'many', 'instances', 'poor', 'judgment', 'simple', 'bad', 'morals', 'early', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'learn', 'lesson', 'later', 'one', 'instance', 'inner', 'disgust', 'boyfriend', 'mother', 'being', 'overweight', 'comment', 'almost', 'plug', 'gay', 'adoption', 'Bringing', 'things', 'failing', 'talk', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'right', 'simply', 'cop-out', 'honestly', 'deserve', 'better.Ultimately', 'strengths', 'movie', 'are', 'found', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'shy', 'weak-willed', 'genuinely', 'care', 'Juno', 'want', 'what', 'best', 'Juno', 'who', 'gradually', 'appreciate', 'kind', 'love', 'kind', 'making', 'sacrifices', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'strengths', 'certainly', 'are.However', 'particular', 'phrasing', 'lesson', 'Juno', 'something', 'someone', 'who', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'humanist', 'moral', 'lesson', 'not', 'Catholic', 'one', 'Love', 'Catholic', 'definition', 'nothing', 'do', 'who', 'person', 'loved', 'everything', 'do', 'person', 'doing', 'loving', 'one-sided', 'decision', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'other', 'person', 'regardless', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'are', 'how', 'may', 'feel', 'them.Ultimately', 'think', 'Juno', 'might', 'serve', 'well', 'guide', 'very', 'self-centered', 'people', 'towards', 'better', 'means', 'thinking', 'movies', 'go', ""n't"", 'stink', ""'re"", 'already', 'strong', 'Catholic', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time']",Juno

1117521,ASSCA9IS0GWF5,B000YABYLA,Laszlo Matyas,"[2, 3]","To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure what Juno is supposed to be. If it was intended as a true-to-life story of teenage pregnancy, then it's almost certainly a failure. The film's titular sixteen-year-old protagonist is the luckiest teen mom in the history of humanity; her parents are completely supportive, the father is hopelessly in love with her, and there's even a nice yuppie couple that's willing to take the little tyke off of her hands. And that's only because Juno decided not to have an abortion, which also would have been fine with all concerned parties. Which isn't to say that it's all sunshine and flowers for the girl (at one point, she even cries real tears!), but it is safe to determine that the movie romanticizes all of the anguish out of teen pregnancy. A female friend of mine jokingly remarked that watching Juno made her want to rush right out and get knocked up. Similarly, Juno isn't much of a coming-of-age story. That genre demands that its characters be challenged,So why the not-too-shabby rating? Well, I like to look on the bright side of things. I see Juno as a vehicle for some great characters and fantastic acting. Of course, Ellen Page steals the show with her generation-defining take on the title role. Her performance is just plain completely wonderful, full of humor and warmth and intelligence and charm. The character itself is a fantastic creation, an endearing balance of coy sarcasm and raw vulnerability hidden under a charming sheen of pop-culture references and smart teenage cool. She's what every sixteen-year-old kid with an above average IQ wishes they could be (Trust me, I tried but couldn't pull it off). Other highlights include Mark and Vanessa (played ably by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), the complex, shifty, but ultimately sympathetic adoptive parents of Juno's kid. There's also Michael Cera, whose portrayal of the meek, endearingly awkward father provides a great foil to Juno's quiet strength. Throw in a duo of goofy parents (yes, Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons are great), a pleasantly ditzy best friend (Olivia Thrilby), and a hilarious appearance by Rainn Wilson, and you've got yourself an irresistible cast of characters.In the end, I see Juno (film and character) as a female counterpart to boy-driven smart teen comedies like The Breakfast Club and Charlie Bartlett.

1117525,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000YABYLA,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[16, 23]","In the past month our local theater chain (we have but one in the Zenith City) has started listed ""Critic's Choice"" movies in their theater listing.  The only two movies selected for such an accolade at the present time were the Coen Brothers' ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""Juno.""  I have already told you everything I know about the former, but of the latter I had heard nothing.  However, Roger Ebert's review of ""Juno"" appeared in the paper, and after scanning the first two paragraphs, where he calls it ""just about the best movie of the year"" and raves about Ellen Page's performance, I decided I wanted to see the movie.  The accompanying photograph showed Page running down the stairs in front of her house in between Allison Janney and J.K. Simmmons.  Recognizing the cast was enough to confirm my decision and I did not bother to read the caption for the photograph or the rest of the review.  Consequently, I sat in the theater today to watch ""Juno"" without any idea of what it was about and I hope that some of you are fortunate enough to have the same experience because with all the time you know what a movie is supposed to be about and you are bitterly disappointed, being pleasantly surprised and falling in love with a movie is pretty sweet.So I am not going to say anything about what the movie is about, although as a teaching of Classical Greek & Roman Mythology I feel compelled to point out that Juno is the wife of Jupiter in Roman mythology and not in Greek mythology, where she is called Hera (Juno is a much better name for the lead character in this movie).  I am going to say that first time writer Diablo Cody should win the Oscar for Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen on the basis of his dialogue in this movie.  At first I was thinking that the dialogue is like a condensed compendium of the sort of language we enjoyed for seven seasons of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" but that does not do Cody's dialogue justice.  The last time I heard dialogue that made me set up and take notice it was probably Quentin Tarentino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" but that was diction and timing rather than word choices.  Probably the closest comparison is between ""Juno"" and ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and that still does not do justice to the delightful verbiage that comes out of the mouths of these characters.The performance from the ensemble is stellar.  Those who have been debating whether Dakota Fanning or Evan Rachel Wood is the best actress under 21 are going to have to include Ellen Page in the debate.  I recognized her from ""X-Men - The Last Stand"" and Michael Cera from ""Superbad,"" but clearly these roles go to the top of their resumes.  I know there is a bandwagon for Page for an Oscar nomination, but Janney and Simmons should be touted for their superb supporting roles as well.  ""Juno"" is the best thing that Jason Bateman has ever done and he is probably the biggest surprise here, although when Jennifer Garner's name came up in the opening credits I wondered what she was doing in this film, but seeing as how Bateman and Garner made ""The Kingdomtogether immediately before filming their roles in ""Juno,"" I suspect that might be the connection.  I have to think that everybody who read this script, from director Jason Reitman (""Thank You for Smoking"") to the entire cast immediately signup for the joy of making this film.The one thing to be aware of is that you should stay for the end credits just to check out the songs that are in this movie, although once the Antsy Pants start playing ""Vampire"" you should want to stick around.  Be forewarned that ""Juno"" is one of those movies where you are going to want to get thesoundtrackon the way home from the theater (or, um, download it as soon as you get home).  The songs done for the movie are by Kimya Dawson, who is a perfect fit for Cody's screenplay, because she seems to be channeling Gilbert & Sullivan through postmodernist sensibilities.  But the great thing about the soundtrack is that all of the key songs that either play in the background or are actually played by (or sung by) the characters in the film are on the CD.  I should also mention that theshooting scriptis out there as well, if you want to read over the choice dialogue again while listening to the eclectic mix of songs on the soundtrack (while waiting for the movie to come out on DVD).",5,"""I don't see what anyone else can see in anyone else...""",1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,4355,"['past', 'month', 'local', 'theater', 'chain', 'have', 'one', 'Zenith', 'City', 'started', 'listed', 'Critic', 'Choice', 'movies', 'theater', 'listing', 'only', 'two', 'movies', 'selected', 'such', 'accolade', 'present', 'time', 'were', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Juno', 'have', 'already', 'told', 'everything', 'know', 'former', 'latter', 'had', 'heard', 'nothing', 'However', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'Juno', 'appeared', 'paper', 'scanning', 'first', 'two', 'paragraphs', 'where', 'just', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'performance', 'decided', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'accompanying', 'photograph', 'showed', 'Page', 'running', 'down', 'stairs', 'front', 'house', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'J.K.', 'Simmmons', 'Recognizing', 'cast', 'was', 'enough', 'confirm', 'decision', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'read', 'caption', 'photograph', 'rest', 'review', 'Consequently', 'sat', 'theater', 'today', 'watch', 'Juno', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'hope', 'are', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'have', 'same', 'experience', 'time', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', 'are', 'bitterly', 'disappointed', 'being', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'falling', 'love', 'movie', 'pretty', 'sweet.So', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'say', 'anything', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'teaching', 'Classical', 'Greek', 'Roman', 'Mythology', 'feel', 'compelled', 'point', 'out', 'Juno', 'wife', 'Jupiter', 'Roman', 'mythology', 'not', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'where', 'called', 'Hera', 'Juno', 'much', 'better', 'name', 'lead', 'character', 'movie', 'am', 'going', 'say', 'first', 'time', 'writer', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'should', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Written', 'Directly', 'Screen', 'basis', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'first', 'was', 'thinking', 'dialogue', 'condensed', 'compendium', 'sort', 'language', 'enjoyed', 'seven', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'not', 'do', 'Cody', 'dialogue', 'justice', 'last', 'time', 'heard', 'dialogue', 'made', 'set', 'up', 'take', 'notice', 'was', 'probably', 'Quentin', 'Tarentino', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'was', 'diction', 'timing', 'rather', 'word', 'choices', 'Probably', 'closest', 'comparison', 'Juno', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'still', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'delightful', 'verbiage', 'mouths', 'characters.The', 'performance', 'ensemble', 'stellar', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'debating', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'best', 'actress', '21', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'include', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'debate', 'recognized', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Superbad', 'clearly', 'roles', 'go', 'top', 'resumes', 'know', 'bandwagon', 'Page', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Janney', 'Simmons', 'should', 'be', 'touted', 'superb', 'supporting', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'Juno', 'best', 'thing', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'ever', 'done', 'probably', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'here', 'when', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'name', 'came', 'up', 'opening', 'credits', 'wondered', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'film', 'seeing', 'how', 'Bateman', 'Garner', 'made', 'Kingdomtogether', 'immediately', 'filming', 'roles', 'Juno', 'suspect', 'might', 'be', 'connection', 'have', 'think', 'everybody', 'who', 'read', 'script', 'director', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'entire', 'cast', 'immediately', 'signup', 'joy', 'making', 'film.The', 'one', 'thing', 'be', 'aware', 'should', 'stay', 'end', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'songs', 'are', 'movie', 'once', 'Antsy', 'Pants', 'start', 'playing', 'Vampire', 'should', 'want', 'stick', 'around', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'Juno', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'get', 'way', 'home', 'theater', 'um', 'download', 'as', 'soon', 'get', 'home', 'songs', 'done', 'movie', 'are', 'Kimya', 'Dawson', 'who', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Cody', 'screenplay', 'be', 'channeling', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'postmodernist', 'sensibilities', 'great', 'thing', 'soundtrack', 'key', 'songs', 'play', 'background', 'are', 'actually', 'played', 'sung', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'CD', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'theshooting', 'scriptis', 'out', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'want', 'read', 'choice', 'dialogue', 'again', 'listening', 'eclectic', 'mix', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'waiting', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'DVD']",Juno

It is a heartwarming story of an off-beat and lovable 16-year old girl who becomes pregnant.  She is exceptionally wise and savvy with one of the most lovable personalities I have ever seen on the scene.  Ellen Page is cast in this role and is absolutely perfect for the part.  I don't think any other actor could have done as well.  I applaud her performance and want to just keep applauding.The screenplay is wonderful too and a great vehicle to showcase her acting.  It is heartwarming and not maudlin as we share her experiences with her understanding family and the prospective adoptive parents who she interviews and bonds with.  There is also good upbeat music throughout which supports the theme of the story.Yes, there are a few bumps along the way.  Her boyfriend invites a different girl to the prom.  The prospective adoptive father becomes enamored with Juno romantically.  She has to deal with her own bulging body and the stares of her classmates.

It was a great story line and acted really well by ALL the cast.  While Ellen Page was very good here, I thought some of the supporting actors were better still.  Jennifer Garner was great as Vanessa - the wife in the couple wanting to adopt a baby.  I thought she was as charming as ever.  Her husband, played by Jason Bateman was also great as a man with doubts about where he is in life.  Juno's friend (the father of the baby) Paulie Bleeker was one of the best actors here.  He was very supportive of Juno and whatever her decision was going to be.  It was also good that Juno had a very supportive father and step-mother, as is not always the case in movies with teenage pregnancy.I must admit, the soundtrack was totally boring and awful, but the acting on all sides made up for that.  Everyone did a superb job and it truly is a feel good movie that really does make you feel good.

1117528,ANVOS4JLN2MKR,B000YABYLA,Lloyd Christmas,"[40, 65]","The acting was quite good throughout. And the geeky-gawky relationship between the protagonist and the geek who impregnated her was extremely believable, as I have known people just like that in my life, and yeah, those two even ended up getting married, and yeah, this girl I know was brassy and spontaneous and this guy I know was quiet and stoical and even shy, but also necessarily having an armour coating impervious to sarcasm, which makes him the perfect guy for a loudmouth girl like that. Fits perfectly with the relationship I saw on the screen here.But the screenplay of this movie was ATTROCIOUS. The 16-year old protagonist talks like she was about 40 or so, and she does so throughout the movie. Actually, even a 40 year old could never have talked like that, not without having first memorized a bad screenplay full of pop culture ""witticisms."" This screenplay writer should be given a mop and bucket and a box of synthetic sawdust and be told to clean the studio up, sweep the floors, wash dishes, do whatever--but just never ever ever think of violating the sensibilities of thinking people anymore with her incredible lack of writing talent.A few other lousy things about this movie: The protagonist's step-mom came off as an amoral cretin, but this movie incongruously tries to make her somehow respectable towards the end, without actually showing any signs of change in her nature. The protagonist's father was basically an absentee father, for most practical purposes, and yet this movie also somehow seems to incongruously lionize him toward the end there.And the married couple that want to adopt, they are horribly artificial, shallow yuppie types with deep-seated problems. The husband, played by Jason Bateman, is a likeable but immature and selfish, 40-year old adolescent; the wife, played by Jennifer Garner, is an immature, spoiled, 35-year old obsessive-compulsive who is a tyrant to her husband, to the point that she relegates his interests and personal possessions to one small sequestered section of their giant yuppified house. Strangely, while Bateman's husband character is shown to be the dirtbag he is by the end of the movie, his wife, played by Garner, who has AT LEAST as many problems as he does, is incongrously made some kind of heroine. Hmmm...Why'd they portray a bad husband as the bad guy, but his bad wife as the good guy? I wonder why they would do that. This fact, plus the fact that the gawky teenage sperm-donor boy (played by Michael Cera) has zero masculine forcefulness to his entire personality (though this is a very believable portrayal nowadays) give this movie a decided male-bashing zest.But the bottom line is, even if everything else in this movie was perfect, the over-the-top dialogue of this ""16-year old Juno"" girl is just so far out and unbelievable that it strains the credulity of the viewer throughout, turning the entire thing into the catastrophe that it is.This movie also has one other shameful oddity that I have never ever seen before: In the Special Features of the DVD, when you check out the Deleted Scenes, what you will find is this: In one of the rarest moments of human stupidity ever, nearly all of the scenes that have been deleted should have in fact been left in, and would have in fact made the movie decidedly better, and they would have explained a lot that was left too ambiguous by the end of the actual edited product. Wow--I didn't check to see who the editor was, but my first guess would be, maybe the awful screenplay writer also did the editing? If not, were they perhaps related? maybe even inbred?

1117532,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B000YABYLA,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[5, 9]","Hmmm... a film about teen pregnancy, huh?I'm going to attempt to review Juno without revealing the twist that takes the film in a new direction from the social stigma. When I saw it, nothing in the trailers or word of mouth spoiled that twist for me. Hopefully, I won't spoil it for readers.Both Diablo Cody, the writer, and Ellen Page, the spirit behind the lead role, Juno (a 16 year old high school junior), have been nominated for awards in countless venues. Page is a veteran, having started in Canadian television when she was only 10. Diablo Cody logs her first screenplay for Juno, and she was working on TV scripts for the film's director, Jason Reitman, at least until the strike. Diablo's irreverence was first launched publicly with her 2006 autobiography, ""Candy Girl"" and yes, she lived and wrote about her life as a young stripper.In the trade-off of writing vs. acting talent, there would be few kudos for writer Cody's material in the hands of an actress less talented than Page (just 20, but plays 16 easily). Conversely, Page, who has played in several Canadian television series and some small films (the most notable of which is the 2005 film about pedophilia, ""Hard Candy""), has never been given material of this nature. The pairing of Cody's acerbic writing with Page's quirky film persona was as successful as the casting of Abigail Breslin as Olive in Little Miss Sunshine. Molding writing and actress is young director Jason Reitman, who has already had one independent hit with ""Thank You for Smoking"" .Together, the three create a perfectly believable, nerdy 16 year old who has enough self-confidence to overcome her birth mother's desertion in her early childhood and her seemingly artless and uncanny ability to fit into a school situation where she understands all the teenage politics and is able to navigate cheerfully on the fringes of many high school communities.  Juno simply has no artifice.Over time, we glimpse that Juno has a passion for music, has played guitar in a teenage band, has two close friends: Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera in a great performance), who was also in the band and is perhaps the shy, male equivalent of Juno's smart outsider, and Leah (Olivia Thirlby) a popular cheerleader who prefers hanging with Juno to hanging with cooler kids in school.Without a lot of forethought, Juno has enticed Paulie into turning a make out session in his room to their first sexual adventure. From the opening of the film, which is colorful and clever, she's become aware that this experiment has left her pregnant. Everyone who she consults from that point, from girlfriend Leah, to the stunned Bleeker, to her parents (J.K. Simmons as her blue collar dad, Mac Macguff and Alison Janney as her stepmom, Bren), to the people who observe her in the school - all of them express no recrimination, and (this is the 21st century, and unfortunately, teenage pregnancy has been out in the open for far too long!) are simply puzzled by why Juno would have something so out-of -character happen to her. Juno, after all, is too smart for her 16 years, absolutely forthcoming with her thoughts and opinions, and not at all a teenage Lolita. Both Juno and Paulie are exactly the opposite of what you would expect teenage parents-to-be; seeming innocents with chutzpah. How did this happen?Although Juno considers abortion, her inquiry into the process leaves her running in another direction, and she decides to give the baby up to someone who really wants a baby. There is never any doubt that Juno knows that keeping the baby is above and beyond what she should expect herself to be able to do. Her maturity in making her own decision and finding a couple (in the Penny Saver!) who sound like good adoptive parents is in keeping with her positive outlook on this. Both Mac and Bren (who are absolutely great in small roles) treat her decisions with respect and are supportive of her in the process. Mac goes to meet the adoptive couple with her.To say that Juno is charming is to describe her meeting with the adoptive parents, the Lorings. Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) is obsessive about becoming a mother and finds it difficult to believe that the reality has walked in the door. Mark (Jason Bateman) is as acerbic as is Juno, and like a few of the other adults that surround her, he senses right from the beginning that she is a kindred soul - honest, forthright, a little eyebrow raising.All does not go smoothly through Juno's pregnancy journey, and the film allows her to pluckily downplay the difficulities she has with her changing body, with people's reaction to her, with her confused and mixed feelings about the Lorings, and about Paulie.In the denouement, you'll have come to know Juno well enough to predict what will happen, and enjoyed your time with her enough to leave the film with a smile on your face. A somewhat black comedy.....yes, but heartwarming and real, along the lines of Searchlight's 2006 hit, ""Little Miss Sunshine"".With some fine supporting performances (Garner's Vanessa becomes truly real when she bumps into Juno in a mall and is coerced into talking to the bump and feeling for an early kick) and a truly effervescent musical score, Juno is not just for teenagers (in fact, it's not for teenagers at all) it has charm for everyone. A light, entertaining, but thought-provoking film, Juno is sure to be on your list of top 10 films for 2007. Go see it!",5,Already bought the soundtrack.....,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,5423,"['Hmmm', 'film', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'huh', ""'m"", 'going', 'attempt', 'review', 'Juno', 'revealing', 'twist',

I tend to go against the grain a bit, . .and then one day  I just happened to be flipping the channel and caught this movie on HBO and I got sucked right into it.  It is interesting to me to see that some people find that this movie represents a glorified version of teenage pregnancy.  I actually thought the oposite and thought that it would make young girls think otherwise before having sex.  Juno is ostracized at school and has to go through all the stresses and emotional trouble that comes with being pregnant.  The most gut wrenching scene was when she had to tell her parents and see the look of dissappointment on her fathers face and then again another scene with her father after the baby is born.  This movie was so well acted by everyone and now I can understand all the buzz.  The dialog is so funny and sarcastic but seems very real. You just have to see this movie.

In the discussion afterwards, there was a wondrous tendency on the part of all these very serious souls to treat this movie as if it were either a depiction of real behavior or a prescription for appropriate behavior.I notice a similar tendency in some of the negative reviews. This is a movie-it 'moves' in a world of story-telling in which the most rational behavior or the most humane attitudes don't always make for the best story.It's curious that this critique-by-morality is brought out for a movie that has to do with teen sex, but never seems to arise about a film like3:10 to Yuma (Widescreen Edition)in which dozens of people are blown away by gunfire. Finding the lead character's emotions or speech or choices offensive is not the same as critiquing a movie.That said, this is a witty burlesque of adolescent life.

1117536,A1HOLE9R6WPT85,B000YABYLA,Mad Max,"[1, 2]","I was stunned at this movie - what a terrific blend of comedy and drama. I left the theater reminded of 2006's Little Miss Sunshine, which also deserved attention from the Academy & other film festivals. But Juno was actually even better.The plot is simple (teenage pregnancy/coming of age), but the film is filled with nuance, unconventional humor, and some very thoughtful and touching moments. All of the acting was superb, without exception, but especially Ellen Page. I left the theater wanting to see it again.There were several things that made it exceptionally funny or thoughtful. I liked for example, the metaphor of the boys track team, and how they kept running in circles (a theme which runs throughout the movie, no pun intended). I also liked that in the end, the most creepy, most dysfunctional & maladjusted characters were the mid-upper class white suburbanites, and in the end, it was the urban working class family that pulled together to work out the dilemma.Perhaps my favorite part of the movie was that Juno's parents, as dysfunctional as they were, still did not react to Juno's pregnancy with hyper-anxiety, by blowing up, etc. Their response was imperfect, but at least it was compassionate, and was supportive of her daughter and her decision. In the end, it was Juno's body, Juno's decision...and even though she was only 16, she showed tremendous strength and resolve (moreso than the adults in the story). Juno was immature, naive, made many mistakes...but she was true to herself and her own self-discovery and her own process. Certainly an endearing character (and actress), and certainly a good role model for most of us, young and old.This was truly an original story - free of the typical cliches & jokes, and not one stitch of toilet humor. There's a lot more I could say about this movie, but the bottom line: I'd like to see more movies like this, and I'm so glad this one made it into the mainstream. Two thumbs way up.

You would think that after all the glowing reviews, the film would at least be a three star spectacle. But no. At best, this is like an independent film with a very 'witty' screenwriter, without whom there would possibly be no film at all.My main problem is the script - no one in real life will ever talk like this. Its just not possible. We are so obsessed as a society with pop culture, that when somebody talks like a pop culture encyclopedia, we find it 'cool' and 'funky'. Well, that only makes it even more pathetic. Every line that comes out of Juno's mouth seems like it was written by a mid-30s pop-culture geek, and it makes her performance seem so stilted and artificial. Not to mention just plain bad.The supporting cast was equally bad. Its bad enough that the tepid lead actress here was nominated for an Oscar (seriously, who nominates these talentless wannabes for the big awards?), the guy playing her boyfriend was especially irritating. Everyone sounds as if they just attended a Gilmore Girls convention, trying to stuff movie and music references into every other sentence they spoke. Roger Ebert inexplicably gave this film four stars, and totally lost my respect in the process.""Juno"" at the end, is just a plain bad film. The movie ends with a contrived scene of Juno and her boyfriend sitting on the steps of a house, banging out a ballad possibly conceived of in indie hell. The soundtrack, while average has one main song (the opening credits) that I found particularly bad.How films like this get great reviews is beyond me.

She stole the show, and she got ROBBED of an Academy Award in 2007 for Best Actress (which she was rightfully nominated for).  In typical Academy fashion, they gave it to an actress no one has ever heard of, in a movie that no one has ever seen ""La Vie En Rose"".  An obscure selection left Ellen Page without a rightfully deserved Oscar.  A shame, she was robbed.I read one page worth of the 1-star reviews on here, and I had to shrug my shoulders in disbelief.  I think a good portion of them were probably written by women or girls with a lot of self-esteem issues.  Were they turned off by Ellen Page's beauty?  Trying to read into some of the reviews, they didn't make a whole lot of sense.  Juno has virtually everything you look for in a movie.  It was a good story, great acting, great production, great music, with great direction.  Can't really accept anything below 4 or 5 stars as being legit.

1117539,AOVU5A9GVXHFT,B000YABYLA,Margaret Opine,"[25, 251]","'JUNO' IN REAL LIFE: I am helping a woman, 56, and her daughter 40, with their transitions through a difficult time in their lives due to an event in the mother's life forty years ago.  (She still won't say how it actually happened: rape or love) but she became pregnant at sixteen and her mother (whose husband left the family of seven kids for a much younger woman with no kids), advised her daughter to give up her child, at sixteen, so she could finish high school and go to college for a degree.Well,she got the B.A. degree in English. At nineteen though,she had twins, who both graduated with M.A. degrees in business.  And, even later she had a son who became a entrepreneur.  Successful family!The mother worked for the government for two decades, became a homeowner, got marrried and divorced more than once and then quit her job hoping to gain the career she dreamed of as an editor and writer.  But launching the career has not happened yet because she is still nurturing a larger and larger family as the days go by.  The baby she gave up called one day 38-years later and their story unfolds after the adoption.SYNDROMES...HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED!  There is no getting around them.  The daughter, I'll call her Mary,38, was adopted by a minister and his wife and she was abused. The hospital records from her childhood tell the story but even she got a B.A. degree from college. She is permanently disabled physically and she is emotionally disturbed and confused psychologically but this is not a ""tragic"" story. These people are tough. They have a ""real"" view of life with a bit of idealism thrown in.We hoped that Mary would become a writer too (her mother was ready to drop her jog toward her writing career to help her daughter but Mary said no). Mary wants to sulk, she wants the luxury of sulking to see how sympathetic the world is to her plight. But the world around her is demanding that book she needs to write to help others and to help the foster care and adoption systems but Mary wants to sulk. So, she sulks.But, just know this...after some time has passed, we can see, Mary may work wonders yet because we can see her going through ALL the stages of syndromes from baby to adolescent and maybe she'll arrive at adulthood in her new life.Her mother welcomed her with opened arms and was glad to see her. Her mother suffers from: I GAVE MY BABY AWAY BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME IT WAS BEST FOR HER SINCE I WAS SIXTEEN SO OTHER PEOPLE COULD GIVE HER A BETTER LIFE THAN ME...Syndrome. This mother grew up to be highly functional and capable so why didn't she go looking for her child? That's why.  So, she suffers the syndrome: I WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE MY CHILD'S MOTHER.Now, she is furiously angry, just enraged that the world told her what to do and it was so very wrong. But, what hurts the most is that her child can't understand why she was given up for adoption no matter how much anyone explains: ""IT WAS THE CULTURE!"" The culture in America says it is best to give the child up for adoption than to try and raise it and we are now learning that we need to quit saying that and just say: ""There are options...make up your own mind...this is your life and your child's life...what you decide will be your story...everyone has a story...and none of know in advance how our stories will turn out.""We now know the miraculous deeds of the single parent and we now know that these deeds can begin at sixteen.AS A CURE...IF THERE IS ONE...we advised Mary to get involved with her seventeen year-old cousin's pregnancy and childbirth and rearing.  She did.  The baby was not adopted.  The baby was kept.  Mary learned that though the seventeen-year-old says she loves her baby, can't live without her baby she has left the baby and not returned for days.  She says she wants to have fun. And so on.This teen mother will eventually catch on and may make a great mother with Mary's help, eventually.In the meantime...they go through all the stages of the syndromes trying to live life and listen to people with ideas about how life should be lived while they are living life as it comes up.  (I hope you see the difference there.  Some people call it, ""with a plan & goal"" versus ""as is.""I FIRST MADE THIS POST EARLY THIS YEAR. I wrote updates on the story.  Amazon.com may have deleted them. I may have been taking up to much space even though I was making a real controversy and getting people's attention.  But the point is this: JUNO, THE MOVIE needed a contrasting review. And, this is it.""JUNO""...was well-written and well-performed. There is no question about that.  Ellen Page is a star performer here and deserves top awards.  You will not forget this movie. The music and the vision of Page with her cute little ponytail is unforgettable. Nothing about this movie is forgettable.It is so surreal and dreamlike (perfect-world-like) that no one wants to be brought back down to earth with my review: ""I AM THE BABY JUNO GAVE AWAY"" to a single mother.  Juno picked the parents from a penny-saver, visited their home, thought she at 16...had done a good investigation of the potential parents, but then the husband bailed. He didn't want the gig but the wife remained passionate for the quest so Juno went through with the adoption and went back to her childhood.NOW LISTEN...I will never-ever tell another female what to do with her body or her pregnancy under dire circumstances and sensibilities. I mean, Nature is natural and natural is cruel sometimes. Natural is abortive sometimes.It is ""ideal"" that is surreal, kind, nice, perfect and relentless.So, am I saying Juno was wrong? No. It is her story and it will be her child's story.  Is there more than one way to do the circumstances that Juno had to deal with?  Of course.  And, abstinence is one.  Sex education is another and there are a lot of ways to do sex education including showing sexual relations on film with childbirth and the child after birth needing to be loved and raised.  I've taught that and I already know how powerful the right kind of sex education can be in a very gentle but impressive form.Would abortion have been wrong?  No.  That would have been JUNO'S choice and story. The movie strongly indicated ""the choice"" process.So, I guess you know I am pro-choice. We are free in this country to create our own stories.I feel strongly though, because of life experience, that: (1)If you give birth that child should have the undeniable right to know something about the circumstances of its conception and birth, and, have the option of meeting the parents or not, and this could be accomplished by video or journal. [JUNO did not want to do that.](2)I feel the child should be told and reminded that they had parents, if they were adopted, or, they had the American foster system that did give them a humane start in life with a huge extended family. (Some very fine people have come out of the foster care system.)WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO PUT PEOPLE DOWN IN AMERICA...if they don't have the perfect (ideal) life but we have seen enough now to know we need to stop that.  We have the system that can raise people from the bottom and put them on top and they can work their way up to help society flow well.WE HAVE A VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TODAY WHOSE TEENAGER IS 'JUNO.'  Sarah does not believe in pro-choice; she believes in childbirth.  Sarah does not believe in sex education; she hopes for the best and feel the child ought to know...without an education. Sarah believes in keeping all children who are born to life.  So, her seventeen-year-old daughter is keeping her child and getting ""shot-gun"" married, some writers are calling it.I have issues with the strong indication that this may not be the daughter's choices for her life but her mother's life-choices. BUT STILL, I stop!  Won't say anymore about it because this is not my life story.  It is Sarah's and her family's.  I made my choices, I gave my advice and point of view to my offspring and I think Sarah has that right as well.  I respect another woman's right to teach her offspring how to live and how to create the story of their lives.  I have my story so I feel everyone should have theirs. (Sarah may not agree.)IN ALL MY SCHOLARLY STUDIES: I find, (1)A second pregnacy is likely; (2)The teen-mother, with proper support, will do well, (3)With the proper support and sacrifice from parents, ANY teenager can keep their child and rise to a highly functional level, and, (4)It is not always the very best idea to enforce marriage in the teen years especially if they are ""shot-gun.""  That may not be highly functional and it will produce more offspring.  And, that seems to make matters worse...the young marriages, unless there is a LOT of proper support.WHY DID I WRITE ALL OF THIS?Because teenagers liked JUNO incessantly! I hope to tell them something to help ground them in the true reality that Juno's child still lives. Therefore, it is a person who needs to be cared for, not just forgotten without consideration.  Therefore: JUNO is not as cute a story as we have enjoyed the movie.THE YOUNG PEOPLE ON THIS WEBPAGE TAUGHT ME SOMETHING TOO.They taught me that they don't want to be awakened from a very good dream.SEE THE MOVIE MORE THAN ONCE AND SEE ALL SIDES OF IT: mother and child, parents/grandparents (who will have to sacrifice); then discuss it, and see the adopting side and see society's side too but overall, that child's life should come first...if the child is born.--Margaret Opine",1,"""HELLO!

1117540,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000YABYLA,Mark Baker,"[2, 6]","Sixteen-year-old Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) has just discovered she is two months pregnant.  The father is her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).  Her first thought, naturally, is to have an abortion.  But when she can't go through with that, she decides to find a nice couple to adopt it.Of course, finding Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) was just the beginning.  She also has to tell her dad and step-mother (J. K. Simmons and Allison Janney).  And she has to carry the baby to term while attending classes at high school.  How will she handle the next few months?If you are thinking about seeing this film, you should take the PG-13 rating seriously.  The movie, especially the first third, is filled with crude language and talk about sex.  I expected that going in, but it still made me cringe.Fortunately, once the movie gets going those things are kept to a minimum.  The story is only slightly realistic, but I got so caught up in it I really didn't care.  They even manage to throw in a twist or two to make the movie unpredictable.This movie works because of the characters.  You absolutely love them from the start and want things to work out well for them.  And the characters work because the acting is universally great.  Ellen Page deserved his Oscar nomination.  In my eyes, the other standout is Jennifer Garner.  You could actually feel her character's longing to have a child.The movie is a comedy, and I did laugh out loud.  Most of the time, however, I chuckled and smiled.  Still, it had a warmth to it that was absolutely charming.Some critics have argued this movie glorifies teen pregnancy.  Frankly, that is a risk any movie runs when it tries to deal with a sensitive subject like this.  While it doesn't dwell on the negatives of the situation (hence my comment about the story not being realistic), it doesn't make things rosier then they are either.  In the end, it is a life affirming movie that is about people taking the twists and turns of life and dealing with them the best way they know how.And for that reason, I liked this movie.  Yes, the first third had me cringing more then I expected to.  But it was a film well worth seeing.",4,Let's Hear It for the Cautionary Whale,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,2205,"['Sixteen-year-old', 'Juno', 'MacGuff', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'just', 'discovered', 'two', 'months', 'pregnant', 'father', 'best', 'friend', 'Paulie', 'Bleeker', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'first', 'thought', 'naturally', 'have', 'abortion', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'find', 'nice', 'couple', 'adopt', 'it.Of', 'course', 'finding', 'Mark', 'Vanessa', 'Loring', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'also', 'tell', 'dad', 'step-mother', 'J.', 'K.', 'Simmons', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'carry', 'baby', 'term', 'attending', 'classes', 'high', 'school', 'How', 'will', 'handle', 'next', 'few', 'months', 'are', 'thinking', 'seeing', 'film', 'should', 'take', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'seriously', 'movie', 'especially', 'first', 'third', 'filled', 'crude', 'language', 'talk', 'sex', 'expected', 'going', 'still', 'made', 'cringe.Fortunately', 'once', 'movie', 'going', 'things', 'are', 'kept', 'minimum', 'story', 'only', 'slightly', 'realistic', 'got', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'even', 'manage', 'throw', 'twist', 'two', 'make', 'movie', 'unpredictable.This', 'movie', 'characters', 'absolutely', 'love', 'start', 'want', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'well', 'characters', 'work', 'acting', 'universally', 'great', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'eyes', 'other', 'standout', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'could', 'actually', 'feel', 'character', 'longing', 'have', 'child.The', 'movie', 'comedy', 'did', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'Most', 'time', 'however', 'chuckled', 'smiled', 'Still', 'had', 'warmth', 'was', 'absolutely', 'charming.Some', 'critics', 'have', 'argued', 'movie', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'Frankly', 'risk', 'movie', 'when', 'deal', 'sensitive', 'subject', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'negatives', 'situation', 'hence', 'comment', 'story', 'not', 'being', 'realistic', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'rosier', 'then', 'are', 'end', 'life', 'affirming', 'movie', 'people', 'taking', 'twists', 'turns', 'life', 'dealing', 'best', 'way', 'know', 'how.And', 'reason', 'liked', 'movie', 'Yes', 'first', 'third', 'had', 'cringing', 'more', 'then', 'expected', 'was', 'film', 'well', 'seeing']",Juno
1117541,A2V5187XI7IQON,B000YABYLA,"Mark ""L A Teacher""","[5, 6]","Most people think Juno, [directed by Jason Reitman] is a movie about teens getting pregnant. Well, if that is what you think, it's totally wrong. Juno, the main character, finds out she's pregnant and tells her parents. Of course her parents flip. But luckily she and her friend find a family that would want to adopt the baby once it is born. Juno starts to have a schoolgirl crush on that dad. She knows she should not get involved in anyway, yet she does. Then Juno realizes that she should be with someone else.This is a very funny movie. It shows a lot of family problems. A lot of time Hollywood shows sisters being as close as friends and mothers being a best friend. In the movie, Juno shows that a family isn't like that.

1117542,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000YABYLA,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[19, 25]","Juno is a great movie that has gotten a lot of hype, and deserves it ALL!!!  Yes, it's about a high school girl who gets pregnant.  But don't get confused, this movie is not so easily classified.  It's not an after school special.  It's not ""pro"" or ""anti"" anything.  It's just a really well written and well executed film about a unique girl dealing with an all too common situation.There's a lot of plot elements to explore.  How will her friends and family react?  What will she do?  How will the experience change her?  No spoilers here: watch the movie and see it unfold.  :)First things first.  Everybody can't love every movie.  Some will under-rate this movie just because it has been SOOOOO hyped.  Believe me, I understand.  All I can say is this: see the movie twice, THEN make up your own mind.The way that mainstream movies get made, it's hard to have a script survive the teams of experts who want to appeal to this and that audience.  I could only detect a handful of planted lines.  The writing is SUPERB and very well presented with front to back execution - directing, acting, editing.  The dialogue is funny and original, like a much more literate Pulp Fiction.  That's what makes this movie special.  It has SOOO much going for it.  Diablo Cody has opened my eyes, and I'm anxiously awaiting her new project currently in pre-production, ""The United States of Tara.""The acting of Ellen Page really is TOP NOTCH. Is it Oscar worthy?  YES!  Without a doubt.  If Julia Roberts can win for Erin Brokovich, they should give Ellen Page her Oscar RIGHT NOW.  Once again, some will say it's overhyped.  Some only think that top notch acting occurs when characters are dying or demented.  I say real acting is good acting.  I walked into a screening before I saw a single review.  I watched the movie twice to confirm it - this performance needs to be seen and studied.The cast is chock full of big names who do very well in some good roles.  Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, and Michael Cera all have good performances.  But Ellen Page IS this movie.  She steals every scene, hits every mark and nails every line.And of course, the music ROCKS!  Those who are into indie rock, alternative and punk rock will recognize most of the music here.  Those who aren't will want to buy the soundtrack, because this is a great introduction.  There is a great mix of new and old, from Velvet Underground and the Kinks to Cat Power and Kimya Dawson.  The songs are used well and you will find at least one new favorite if you don't know this music already.JunoThe camera work is also very good.  High quality camera and film equipment has either dropped in price by a lot, or films like this are finally starting to get decent budgets.  Either way, this is not epic filming, but it is flawless and effective.  Good directing by Jason Reitman is no surprise to me.Now here's the hard question with 2 honest answers: Is this a movie best seen in theatres, or can it ""wait"" for DVD?Answer #1: There's no special effects that make the movie visually different when seen in a theatre.  So some might say wait.  Still, it was worth it for me just to see how the crowd reacted to Juno's phrases, the music, everything.  So that's an honest, qualified YES.Answer #2: This is really the best overall movie I've seen in a LONG time.  I saw it twice in the theatre.  If you like really good movies, and good acting, SEE IT NOW.  YES, it's definitely worth seeing sooner than later.  You will still want to buy the DVD if you're like me.I really hope you'll check this one out.

There's quirky and then there is over-the-top quirky.  Thankfully, this was nothing like the aforementioned film.This is a great little 1.5 hour flick well worth your time. It takes a few minutes to pull you in, for the first 20 minutes I was on the fence as  to whether I was going to get involved.  I couldn't tell whether there was a decent film buried among the quirky tunes and cheeky, cynical teen dialog.  Be patient, a good story is in there.Page is perfect,her mannerisms, her delivery, her presence.  All totally believable. It's a story that drags you into this 16 year-olds' world and about 30 minutes in you realize that despite this kid's cheek and smart mouth, you really do like her and keep your fingers crossed for her.Maybe a couple of the quirky tunes I could have done without.  I don't know, they seemed a little over-done to me but that's ok.  I love the fact that she played Mott the Hoople's All the Young Dudes, a favorite of mine that had radio play when I was about her age.  It would have been great to have had a friend like Juno when I was sixteen.  She certainly helps make her friend's (all 2 or 3 of them) lives interesting and entertaining.Jason Bateman.  This guy is always able to play the perfect smarmy, good-looking, charming-then-arrogant creep isn't he?  I sure hope he really isn't this way in real life.  Every time I see this guy the character he plays makes me want to punch him in the face (credit the writers I guess)  I knew the guy was going to be a jerk from the first scene for his character (Mark).Jennifer Garner finally gets to play in a very different role.  Totally feminine and full of mother-wanna-be goodness.I loved this film.  It isn't a chick flick either, just a quirky comedy/drama about a young lady who doesn't know who she is,finds herself with child, grows up (just a little bit) and learns to deal with it. Entertaining, witty and totally believable.One fear:  Some clod will try to turn it into a TV series, maybe a ""Joan of My So-Called Life"" kind of thing?

1117544,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B000YABYLA,Mark Turner,"[2, 4]","The screwball comedy was a staple in theaters when movies first discovered sound. The antics of Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart and a ton of other actors made audiences laugh and weep and in general have a good time at the box office. This genre comes to life once more with the release of JUNO.Juno (Ellen Page) is a typical teen for the most part. As opposed to most films that center the attention around the cheerleader (face it, percentage wise how many teens are actually cheerleaders?), Juno is a normal student who has a strong attachment to her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). So much so that she seduces him and the two share their first intimate moment with one another. With, for them, unexpected results.Yes, Juno ends up pregnant. She lets her parents in on what has happened and the pair offers her support as opposed to verbal abuse. Visiting a local abortion clinic, she thinks twice and decides instead to have the baby. Their support helps her to locate a nice couple seeking to adopt in an upper middle class home.As Juno's pregnancy continues, she keeps in touch with the couple, letting them know what's going on. She also begins to bond with the husband (Jason Bateman) who she shares interests with in music and movies.  The wife (Jennifer Garner) just sees Juno as the mother carrying the child that she so desperately wants.As the film progresses, we are given a look at this young lady who is facing a crisis in a more level headed manner than we would expect, not only from those in real life but from film lives as well. Juno jokes about her pregnancy, sarcastically spills out about her less than supportive boyfriend and discusses life in general. She is one of the most well rounded characters seen on film in some time and it was a delight to glimpse this life.The film progresses to a point where we discover all is not well with the ""perfect family"" Juno has chosen for her child. It's a revelatory moment that affects not only the couple involved but Juno as well. It's a discovery that the world is a difficult place to find perfection in no matter how much you desire it.The ending of the film is fantastic. No quick solutions, no movie filled dream sequence where everything turns out the way a Hollywood writer would want it to be. No, this time we are offered a chance to see a real solution where there is a happy ending, just not the one you expected.This low budget gem arrived in theaters and was hailed by critics and fans alike and understandably so. It feels fresher than anything seen in months, perhaps years. The look of the film is great, the direction is top notch and the acting is some of the best seen lately. Low key when needed and abrupt at others, all of the actors involved deserve notices for a job well done.Outstanding from the rest is Page as Juno. Having made a name for herself in the revenge drama HARD CANDY, she shows a different side here in the smart mouthed, in over her head Juno. She carries off this character as if she were portraying herself rather than someone written. It is her performance that centers this film and makes it a gift.JUNO is not your typical pregnant teen flick. It's more than that. It's a glimpse of life as it is, life as it can be as opposed to the two options most Hollywood films offer of dysfunctional families of happy ever after marriages. The movie shows real life in a pleasant way, and isn't that what it's usually all about?",5,SCREWBALL COMEDY FOR THE MILLENIUM,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,3440,"['screwball', 'comedy', 'was', 'staple', 'theaters', 'when', 'movies', 'first', 'discovered', 'sound', 'antics', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'ton', 'other', 'actors', 'made', 'audiences', 'laugh', 'weep', 'general', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'box', 'office', 'genre', 'life', 'once', 'more', 'release', 'JUNO.Juno', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'typical', 'teen', 'most', 'part', 'opposed', 'most', 'films', 'center', 'attention', 'cheerleader', 'face', 'percentage', 'wise', 'how', 'many', 'teens', 'are', 'actually', 'cheerleaders', 'Juno', 'normal', 'student', 'who', 'strong', 'attachment', 'best', 'friend', 'Paulie', 'Bleeker', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'So', 'much', 'two', 'share', 'first', 'intimate', 'moment', 'one', 'unexpected', 'results.Yes', 'Juno', 'up', 'pregnant', 'parents', 'happened', 'pair', 'support', 'opposed', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'Visiting', 'local', 'abortion', 'clinic', 'twice', 'decides', 'instead', 'have', 'baby', 'support', 'locate', 'nice', 'couple', 'seeking', 'adopt', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'home.As', 'Juno', 'pregnancy', 'touch', 'couple', 'letting', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'also', 'bond', 'husband', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'who', 'shares', 'interests', 'music', 'movies', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'just', 'Juno', 'mother', 'carrying', 'child', 'so', 'desperately', 'wants.As', 'film', 'are', 'given', 'look', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'facing', 'crisis', 'more', 'level', 'headed', 'manner', 'would', 'expect', 'not', 'only', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'lives', 'as', 'well', 'Juno', 'pregnancy', 'sarcastically', 'out', 'less', 'supportive', 'boyfriend', 'life', 'general', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'rounded', 'characters', 'seen', 'film', 'time', 'was', 'delight', 'glimpse', 'life.The', 'film', 'point', 'where', 'discover', 'not', 'well', 'perfect', 'family', 'Juno', 'chosen', 'child', 'revelatory', 'moment', 'not', 'only', 'couple', 'involved', 'Juno', 'as', 'well', 'discovery', 'world', 'difficult', 'place', 'find', 'perfection', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'desire', 'it.The', 'ending', 'film', 'fantastic', 'quick', 'solutions', 'movie', 'filled', 'dream', 'sequence', 'where', 'everything', 'out', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'writer', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'time', 'are', 'offered', 'chance', 'see', 'real', 'solution', 'where', 'happy', 'ending', 'just', 'not', 'one', 'expected.This', 'low', 'budget', 'gem', 'arrived', 'theaters', 'was', 'hailed', 'critics', 'fans', 'alike', 'understandably', 'so', 'fresher', 'anything', 'seen', 'months', 'perhaps', 'years', 'look', 'film', 'great', 'direction', 'top', 'notch', 'acting', 'best', 'seen', 'lately', 'Low', 'key', 'when', 'needed', 'abrupt', 'others', 'actors', 'involved', 'deserve', 'notices', 'job', 'well', 'done.Outstanding', 'rest', 'Page', 'Juno', 'Having', 'made', 'name', 'herself', 'revenge', 'drama', 'HARD', 'CANDY', 'different', 'side', 'here', 'smart', 'mouthed', 'head', 'Juno', 'character', 'were', 'portraying', 'rather', 'someone', 'written', 'performance', 'film', 'gift.JUNO', 'not', 'typical', 'pregnant', 'teen', 'flick', 'more', 'glimpse', 'life', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'opposed', 'two', 'options', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'offer', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'happy', 'ever', 'marriages', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'pleasant', 'way', ""n't"", 'what', 'usually']",Juno

The story is well-structured. Juno's parents are particularly strong, fairly believable, and likable. The boyfriend, with his corpse-white legs in his hideous yellow running shorts and what-just-went-past-me? expression, has an authentic sort of dweeby charm. So I gave it three stars.But . . .The script tries way too hard to be cool. I'm shocked that it won an Academy Award. If people in movies talked the way people talk in real life, movies would be incredibly boring, but this script is so filled with clever remark after clever remark that it gets tiresome in a different way. It's as if the whole thing is made up of things you wish you'd said an hour after you're out of the awkward situation.I did not find Juno's character to be like any teenage girl I've ever experienced, and I've been one and raised one, so I'd claim at least a modicum of expertise. She reminded me of Calvin in Calvin & Hobbes. While things about her are teenager-like, just as things about Calvin are little-boy-like, she is not recognizable to me as a real teenager any more than Calvin is recognizable to me as a real little boy. The script rather than Ellen Page's performance is at fault. Based on Juno and Hard Candy, Ms. Page is a reason to see just about any movie.The cute little indie songs are extremely annoying.Finally, you can't really talk about the movie without talking about the pregnancy. Juno made an admirable and intelligent choice given her circumstances (closed adoption with the baby going to a loving home and Juno going on with her journey to adulthood unencumbered by an infant). Nonetheless, the movie cheated for the ban-all-abortion contingent by making the abortion clinic horrifically gross and grungy, and even more so by making Juno's delivery look like it took about five seconds and she barely broke a sweat.Worth a look, but I wouldn't buy it or rent it again.",3,Entertaining but Problematic,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,2056,"['Juno', 'tale', 'smart', 'teenager', 'who', 'pregnant', 'give', 'baby', 'up', 'adoption', 'very', 'strong', 'acting', 'leads', 'supporting', 'cast', 'story', 'well-structured', 'Juno', 'parents', 'are', 'particularly', 'strong', 'fairly', 'believable', 'likable', 'boyfriend', 'corpse-white', 'legs', 'hideous', 'yellow', 'running', 'shorts', 'what-just-went-past-me', 'expression', 'authentic', 'sort', 'dweeby', 'charm', 'gave', 'three', 'stars.But', '.The', 'script', 'tries', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'cool', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'people', 'movies', 'talked', 'way', 'people', 'talk', 'real', 'life', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'script', 'so', 'filled', 'clever', 'remark', 'clever', 'remark', 'tiresome', 'different', 'way', 'whole', 'thing', 'made', 'things', 'wish', ""'d"", 'said', 'hour', ""'re"", 'awkward', 'situation.I', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'Juno', 'character', 'be', 'teenage', 'girl', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'experienced', ""'ve"", 'been', 'one', 'raised', 'one', ""'d"", 'claim', 'least', 'modicum', 'expertise', 'reminded', 'Calvin', 'Calvin', 'Hobbes', 'things', 'are', 'teenager-like', 'just', 'things', 'Calvin', 'are', 'little-boy-like', 'not', 'recognizable', 'real', 'teenager', 'more', 'Calvin', 'recognizable', 'real', 'little', 'boy', 'script', 'rather', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'performance', 'fault', 'Based', 'Juno', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'Ms', 'Page', 'reason', 'see', 'just', 'movie.The', 'cute', 'little', 'indie', 'songs', 'are', 'extremely', 'annoying.Finally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'talk', 'movie', 'talking', 'pregnancy', 'Juno', 'made', 'admirable', 'intelligent', 'choice', 'given', 'circumstances', 'closed', 'adoption', 'baby', 'going', 'loving', 'home', 'Juno', 'going', 'journey', 'adulthood', 'unencumbered', 'infant', 'Nonetheless', 'movie', 'cheated', 'ban-all-abortion', 'contingent', 'making', 'abortion', 'clinic', 'horrifically', 'gross', 'grungy', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'making', 'Juno', 'delivery', 'look', 'took', 'about', 'five', 'seconds', 'barely', 'broke', 'sweat.Worth', 'look', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'rent', 'again']",Juno

Of course, an award doesn't make a movie, but it's nice to show appreciation.  Little Miss Sunshine should have won Best Picture in 2007, just as this should have won this year.  More people can relate to this movie than they can No Country For Old Men or There Will Be Blood.Ellen Page deserved Best Actress for this as well.

Tagliaferro,"[1, 2]","While there is nothing funny about a 16-year-old girl dealing with her unexpected pregnancy, Ellen Page portrayed Juno as a quirky teenager who was blatantly honest and surprisingly humorous.  Of all pregnant teen films, this was the most comical, however, the pain and consequences of making an adult decision came through loud and clear.At first I didn't like Juno because she was a little difficult to understand, like she was speaking a different language known only to her peers.  Then she quickly became likeable because in spite of her mannerisms, her innocence showed through.  The girl was not street-wise, she was just a regular kid.  She wasn't flippant, she was actually overly practical and mature, and most of all, she had a character strong enough not to care what people thought of her.She had a non-conventional, but loving and supportive family.  Her stepmother was funny, and I like the way her family called her June Bug at times.  And I loved the change of seasons and the constantly jogging football team, or was it a track team?While it was cute and had a happy ending, I also found it to be sad and wished her family kept the baby until she was ready for it.  But then that would have ruined the effect that nothing is perfect, but that sometimes things work out anyway if we want them to.

Haiman,"[3, 4]","I love Juno for reasons not only great in number, but reasons that are hard to express.Firstly, Ellen Page is a likable teen girl who just happens to be pregnant. I can't imagine anyone other than Ellen playing Juno. Juno is a sarcastic, at times dead pan, normal girl who have her freaky quirks. Her sarcasm only hides the depth of emotion that she has, and Juno rarely lets anyone in her inner sanctum. She knows love, pain, both emotionally and physically, has high hopes for her baby, which is why she gives the baby up, and shows the true maturity it takes to raise a child. She knows that there are better things for her baby that she can't give and that there are things she wants for herself that would not be possible if she had a child. She is a child herself, just with a hardened, skewed vision of life.Secondly, Bleeker is a cute and has an innocence to him that you don't always see in teens in movies. He loves Juno and wants to be there for her but it unsure of how to be and just does what he can to get by in the film but that generally means not sticking up for himself.Next, I like that the movie looks differently at teen pregnancy. I am not saying that being a pregnant is easy, should be glorified or is a wonderful thing, but it is still a pregnancy, which is considered a blessing and a beautiful thing. Juno shows that it isn't just a have an abortion or ""screw up"" your life type of situation. People can find blessed miracles in garbage dumps of situations.I recommend this movie for EVERYONE.",5,"I love, love, love this movie.",1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,1521,"['love', 'Juno', 'reasons', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'number', 'reasons', 'are', 'hard', 'express.Firstly', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'likable', 'teen', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'pregnant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'other', 'Ellen', 'playing', 'Juno', 'Juno', 'sarcastic', 'times', 'dead', 'pan', 'normal', 'girl', 'who', 'have', 'freaky', 'quirks', 'sarcasm', 'only', 'depth', 'emotion', 'Juno', 'rarely', 'anyone', 'inner', 'sanctum', 'love', 'pain', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'high', 'hopes', 'baby', 'why', 'baby', 'up', 'true', 'maturity', 'raise', 'child', 'are', 'better', 'things', 'baby', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'are', 'things', 'herself', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'possible', 'had', 'child', 'child', 'just', 'hardened', 'skewed', 'vision', 'life.Secondly', 'Bleeker', 'cute', 'innocence', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'see', 'teens', 'movies', 'Juno', 'be', 'there', 'unsure', 'how', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'film', 'generally', 'not', 'sticking', 'up', 'himself.Next', 'like', 'movie', 'differently', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'being', 'pregnant', 'easy', 'should', 'be', 'glorified', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'still', 'pregnancy', 'considered', 'blessing', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'Juno', ""n't"", 'just', 'have', 'abortion', 'screw', 'up', 'life', 'type', 'situation', 'People', 'can', 'find', 'blessed', 'miracles', 'garbage', 'dumps', 'situations.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'EVERYONE']",Juno

For me, Fox's Searchlight studio has become my personal favorite for extremly great indie comedies. They scored last year with Little Miss Sunshine (another film I absolutly love) and they do it again with Juno. But for me, I feel Juno really achieved something far greater then Little Miss Sunshine did. Not only did the film make me laugh but when I left the theater, I just couldn't help but feel uplifted and joyous. It's just one of those films that not only has a great wit but a real heart inside it. Something I did not feel with Knocked Up and Superbad and I know, people will hate me for saying that, but its true. For me, Juno was the only comedy that, I felt, really achieved the true 'heart' of a film.Now, most everyone is by now familiar with the story but i'll just do it again just to refresh those who have gone fuzzy. Juna MacGuff has just found out she is nine weeks pregnant, the father happening to be her longtime friend and admirer Paulie Bleaker. After originally thinking about an abortion, she has a last minute change of heart and decides to give the baby up for adoption to a family she looked up in the local Pennysaver. We are then taken through the entire process of Juno dealing with her pregnancy, the adoptive family, just really everyday life that a pregnant teen can go through.Now, I have been a fan of Ellen Page (Oscar Nominated this year, kudos) ever since I saw her in Hard Candy (a film that I felt really showed off her dramatic range), I just think she really is a talented young actress and true role model girls AND guys can look up to. As Juno, she combines a blend of biting wit, teen angst, and even motherly instinct into a fire cracker of a character. Another standout being Jennifer Garner, who just completly transforms her character from an icy, controling person to someone caring and warm by the end of the film. J.K. Simmons, Jason Batemen, Allison Janney, and Olivia Thirlby are also just as good, Thirlby I think having all the best lines.And of course, we cannot forget Diablo Cody, who crafted a heartful and witty screenplay from a topic that could have easily been just another run of the mill teen pregnancy film. If she dosen't win the Originally Screenplay Oscar, I will automatically call for a recount. As for Jason Reitman, I feel he does a good job directing this film, obviously having a flare for making smart comedies (like his previous effort, Thank You for Smoking, another great film from Searchlight) but I don't feel he should have been nominated for Best Director, I felt that the fifth slot really should have gone so Joe Wright (director of the beautiful Atonement) but still, I felt he did his job.I would definently place Juno on my top ten of 2007, cause for me it was one of the few highly praised films this year that I truley felt delivered on everything the critics praised about. But then again, I rarely agree with the critics, so even more props to the film that really connected with all audiences and not something that only the critics seemed to have got. So, if you truely, TRUELY, want to see a film that will not only make you laugh but give you that warm fuzzy feeling, Juno is definently the film to see.",5,A Fun and Infectious Film,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,3241,"['am', 'love', 'Juno', 'really', 'am', 'Fox', 'Searchlight', 'studio', 'become', 'personal', 'favorite', 'extremly', 'great', 'indie', 'comedies', 'scored', 'last', 'year', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'film', 'absolutly', 'love', 'do', 'again', 'Juno', 'feel', 'Juno', 'really', 'achieved', 'something', 'far', 'greater', 'then', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'did', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'film', 'make', 'when', 'left', 'theater', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'uplifted', 'joyous', 'just', 'one', 'films', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'wit', 'real', 'heart', 'Something', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Superbad', 'know', 'people', 'will', 'hate', 'saying', 'true', 'Juno', 'was', 'only', 'comedy', 'felt', 'really', 'achieved', 'true', ""'heart"", 'film.Now', 'most', 'everyone', 'now', 'familiar', 'story', 'i', ""'ll"", 'just', 'do', 'again', 'just', 'refresh', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'fuzzy', 'Juna', 'MacGuff', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'nine', 'weeks', 'pregnant', 'father', 'happening', 'be', 'longtime', 'friend', 'admirer', 'Paulie', 'Bleaker', 'originally', 'thinking', 'abortion', 'last', 'minute', 'change', 'heart', 'decides', 'give', 'baby', 'up', 'adoption', 'family', 'looked', 'up', 'local', 'Pennysaver', 'are', 'then', 'taken', 'entire', 'process', 'Juno', 'dealing', 'pregnancy', 'adoptive', 'family', 'just', 'really', 'everyday', 'life', 'pregnant', 'teen', 'can', 'go', 'through.Now', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Oscar', 'Nominated', 'year', 'kudos', 'ever', 'saw', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'film', 'felt', 'really', 'showed', 'off', 'dramatic', 'range', 'just', 'think', 'really', 'talented', 'young', 'actress', 'true', 'role', 'model', 'girls', 'guys', 'can', 'look', 'up', 'Juno', 'blend', 'biting', 'wit', 'teen', 'angst', 'even', 'motherly', 'instinct', 'fire', 'cracker', 'character', 'standout', 'being', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'who', 'just', 'completly', 'character', 'icy', 'controling', 'person', 'someone', 'caring', 'warm', 'end', 'film', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Jason', 'Batemen', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'are', 'also', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Thirlby', 'think', 'having', 'best', 'lines.And', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'who', 'crafted', 'heartful', 'witty', 'screenplay', 'topic', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'just', 'run', 'mill', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'film', 'dose', ""n't"", 'win', 'Originally', 'Screenplay', 'Oscar', 'will', 'automatically', 'call', 'recount', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'feel', 'good', 'job', 'directing', 'film', 'obviously', 'having', 'flare', 'making', 'smart', 'comedies', 'previous', 'effort', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'great', 'film', 'Searchlight', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'felt', 'fifth', 'slot', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'so', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'director', 'beautiful', 'Atonement', 'still', 'felt', 'did', 'job.I', 'would', 'definently', 'place', 'Juno', 'top', 'ten', '2007', 'cause', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'highly', 'praised', 'films', 'year', 'truley', 'felt', 'delivered', 'everything', 'critics', 'praised', 'about', 'then', 'again', 'rarely', 'agree', 'critics', 'so', 'even', 'more', 'props', 'film', 'really', 'connected', 'audiences', 'not', 'something', 'only', 'critics', 'seemed', 'have', 'got', 'So', 'truely', 'TRUELY', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'give', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'Juno', 'definently', 'film', 'see']",Juno

Abortion seems like the easy way out, but when Juno arrives at the clinic for her appointment, she finds that she can't go through with it. Instead, she decides to give the baby up for adoption to a wealthy couple, Mark and Vanessa (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), who are unable to have children of their own. As Juno experiences the many ups and downs of pregnancy, she must come to terms with her feelings toward her unborn baby, the baby's father, and the adoptive parents. It soon becomes clear that the adoption process isn't nearly as simple as Juno hoped it would be, and she must deal with a lot of grown-up issues very quickly.I was very impressed by this film. Page gives an outstanding performance that is both wickedly funny and deeply emotional. Her characterization of Juno is very understated and yet incredibly powerful, and she steals every scene that she's in. The movie also boasts an impressive supporting cast, including J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's father and stepmother. Although ""Juno"" is classified as a comedy, it's very bittersweet and downright depressing at times.

It implies it is easy. But the baby experiences an acute abandonment trauma, and always yearns to reunite with his/her mother. The mother, too.In addition, babies slated for being given away are typically given up too soon. Recent research indicates that a newborn needs contact with its mother for at least six weeks after birth or it doesn't develop optimally.In the first season of Glee a girl gives her baby away as soon as it is born. There is no visible effect on the girl, no ambivalence or sense of loss. It is easy. The baby's experiences are unknown. A young girl I know, after watching these episodes, said, 'If you get pregnant you can just give the baby away!' She seemed relieved and as if she had learned a delightful new key to a possible future problem.I wonder how many many girls have developed this notion from the film only to find it doesn't work that way in real life, how many adoptees have been born and suffered who would not have had to suffer, because they become sloppy about saying no to sex when they don't really want it and/or get sloppy about properly and regularly using contraceptives.I think this film is dangerous to girls and young women.From a long-time, former trauma and family psychotherapist.",1,Giving away a baby is bad for babies.,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,1390,"['popular', 'movie', 'very', 'wrong', 'impression', 'deeply', 'complicated', 'painful', 'experiences', 'birth', 'mother', 'baby', 'have', 'lives', 'easy', 'baby', 'acute', 'abandonment', 'trauma', 'always', 'yearns', 'reunite', 'mother', 'mother', 'too.In', 'addition', 'babies', 'slated', 'being', 'given', 'away', 'are', 'typically', 'given', 'up', 'too', 'soon', 'Recent', 'research', 'newborn', 'needs', 'contact', 'mother', 'least', 'six', 'weeks', 'birth', ""n't"", 'develop', 'optimally.In', 'first', 'season', 'Glee', 'girl', 'baby', 'away', 'as', 'soon', 'born', 'visible', 'effect', 'girl', 'ambivalence', 'sense', 'loss', 'easy', 'baby', 'experiences', 'are', 'unknown', 'young', 'girl', 'know', 'watching', 'episodes', 'said', 'get', 'pregnant', 'can', 'just', 'give', 'baby', 'away', 'seemed', 'relieved', 'had', 'learned', 'delightful', 'new', 'key', 'possible', 'future', 'problem.I', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'many', 'girls', 'have', 'developed', 'notion', 'film', 'only', 'find', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'real', 'life', 'how', 'many', 'adoptees', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'suffered', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'suffer', 'become', 'sloppy', 'saying', 'sex', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'and/or', 'get', 'sloppy', 'properly', 'regularly', 'using', 'contraceptives.I', 'think', 'film', 'dangerous', 'girls', 'young', 'long-time', 'former', 'trauma', 'family', 'psychotherapist']",Juno

Its that good. The great Ellen Page (i love her) plays Juno, a cute, hip, at times smart-alecky teen whose life is turned upside down after she discovers shes pregnant by her best friend. I know some people made a slight fuss over this film because they thought it was glorifying teen pregnancy, but i think they totally missed the point. The filmmakers, including director Jason Reitman and first time scriptwriter Diablo Cody, handle this scenario with wit and a sweetness that doesnt seep into annoyance or contrivance, which another filmmaker mightve felt compelled to do.This is a great film with characters that we totally invest our time and energy with, from J.K. Simmons as Juno's understanding yet firm dad, to Allison Janney as her no-nonsense stepmom, all the way to Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as the young yuppie couple who want to adopt Juno's baby but have some major issues of their own, to Michael Cera, great as the young, innocent soon to be dad.

But for all its' uniqueness and for the hour and a half of harmless entertainment that it provided, I didn't really see anything that was worthy of a nomination. Was it an off year for movies in 2007 or what ? Juno is an interesting look at teenage pregnancy through the lens of Juno Mcguff (Ellen Page) who has just been impregnated by her friend Pauley Bleaker (Michael Cera) and now has to figure out what to do with the baby. This movie doesn't appear to take a stand on abortion even though Juno's character makes certain statements at an abortion clinic.The story turns when Juno finds the perfect couple Mark and Vanessa (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner.) only to discover that their no more perfect than anyone else on the planet as Mark confesses the impending divorce to Juno before talking to Vanessa. My feeling is that Mark's relationship with Juno is an underplayed phenomenon. As Juno navigates the turbulent waters of pregnancy, she also confronts the permanently altered though not destroyed relationship with Pauley and being hated by Pauley's family. I felt disconnected to the movie because I was never allowed to get invested in any one of the characters. It was just kind of a story that moved from a to b with any real emotion or feeling.The bottom line is that Juno is high on story, but low on characterization because other than Vanessa, the characters don't really lose anything. At end of the movie, Juno and Pauley ride off past the track team as though nothing has changed, even though Juno had his baby and made the difficult decision to give the baby up for adoption.

1117564,AK1298ALMMYK0,B000YABYLA,Mushroom Samba~,"[2, 2]","First, this is the best version, in terms of video quality, of Juno available.  Sadly for fans of the flick, Fox is easily the laziest major studio when it comes to authoring Blu-ray discs.  While Juno doesn't look bad by any stretch of the imagination, it does at times disappoint visually.  Considering that this movie is less than a year old, the so-so quality of this Blu-ray release defies logic.Juno has an intentionally warm color palate; orange tick tacks, red running uniforms, the interiors of Juno's house, and Juno's wardrobe being a few examples.  In many scenes, almost every scene at Juno's house, colors run together in a sort of dull mesh of blah.  I'm blaming this on Fox's penchant for hastily, and poorly mind you, slapping films on Blu-ray disc without taking the time to polish the image to maximum clarity.  This is a minor nitpick, and one that doesn't even really deserve a full 1 star deduction, but these scenes just left me wondering about future HD releases from Fox.  Sony is a studio that appreciates what Blu-ray is capable of, not surprising since Sony is the biggest pusher of Blu-ray out there.  Still, Juno fails to achieve the sort of three dimensionality inherent to other HD releases.Usually I focus on the quality of the release, as opposed to the film itself, in order to let others know exactly what it is they're getting for their hard earned money, but I'll be deviating from that trend a little bit here.  First I should say that Juno comes with a decent amount of bonus content, and surprisingly most of it is worth watching.Now in regards to the film itself, there are a few points of contention I have with Juno.  Diablo Cody's dialog is just a little hard to swallow for me.  I've watched this movie with two different audiences, the 20 something crowd and the 20 something crowd's parents.  The 20 somethings for the most part dig Cody's super-fast slang-laden back and forth, but the older folks occasionally find it a barrier to really enjoying a film.  I totally understand where the old folks are coming from.  A few lines that I found to be particularly ... well stupid are; ""wizard!"" as an exclamation and ""honest to blog"" used as honest to god.  Once again I'm nit-picking here, because truly is a great film.  But as the folks over at highdefdigest pointed out in their stellar review, Juno suffers from a ""too cool for school"" (quoting the digest review here f.y.i.) brand of dialog.  It's just not very believable, which is a shame because the films narrative itself is so utterly plausible.  While Cody's bogus dialog doesn't ruin the film, it may very well prevent you from really getting into this flick.  A shame really, because Juno is, potentially, a film everyone should see.",4,"Good, but not quite perfect, video transfer",1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,2742,"['First', 'best', 'version', 'terms', 'video', 'quality', 'Juno', 'available', 'Sadly', 'fans', 'flick', 'Fox', 'easily', 'laziest', 'major', 'studio', 'when', 'authoring', 'Blu-ray', 'discs', 'Juno', ""n't"", 'look', 'bad', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'times', 'disappoint', 'visually', 'Considering', 'movie', 'less', 'year', 'old', 'so-so', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'defies', 'logic.Juno', 'intentionally', 'warm', 'color', 'palate', 'tick', 'tacks', 'red', 'running', 'uniforms', 'interiors', 'Juno', 'house', 'Juno', 'wardrobe', 'being', 'few', 'examples', 'many', 'scenes', 'almost', 'scene', 'Juno', 'house', 'colors', 'run', 'together', 'sort', 'dull', 'mesh', 'blah', ""'m"", 'blaming', 'Fox', 'penchant', 'hastily', 'poorly', 'mind', 'slapping', 'films', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'taking', 'time', 'polish', 'image', 'maximum', 'clarity', 'minor', 'nitpick', 'one', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'deserve', 'full', '1', 'star', 'deduction', 'scenes', 'just', 'left', 'wondering', 'future', 'HD', 'releases', 'Fox', 'Sony', 'studio', 'what', 'Blu-ray', 'capable', 'not', 'surprising', 'Sony', 'biggest', 'pusher', 'Blu-ray', 'there', 'Still', 'Juno', 'achieve', 'sort', 'three', 'dimensionality', 'inherent', 'other', 'HD', 'releases.Usually', 'focus', 'quality', 'release', 'opposed', 'film', 'order', 'let', 'others', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'hard', 'earned', 'money', ""'ll"", 'be', 'deviating', 'trend', 'little', 'bit', 'here', 'First', 'should', 'say', 'Juno', 'decent', 'amount', 'bonus', 'content', 'surprisingly', 'most', 'worth', 'watching.Now', 'regards', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'points', 'contention', 'have', 'Juno', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'dialog', 'just', 'little', 'hard', 'swallow', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'two', 'different', 'audiences', '20', 'something', 'crowd', '20', 'something', 'crowd', 'parents', '20', 'somethings', 'most', 'part', 'dig', 'Cody', 'super-fast', 'slang-laden', 'back', 'forth', 'older', 'folks', 'occasionally', 'find', 'barrier', 'really', 'enjoying', 'film', 'totally', 'understand', 'where', 'old', 'folks', 'are', 'coming', 'few', 'lines', 'found', 'be', 'particularly', 'well', 'stupid', 'are', 'wizard', 'exclamation', 'honest', 'blog', 'used', 'honest', 'god', 'Once', 'again', ""'m"", 'nit-picking', 'here', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'folks', 'highdefdigest', 'pointed', 'out', 'stellar', 'review', 'Juno', 'suffers', 'too', 'cool', 'school', 'quoting', 'digest', 'review', 'here', 'f.y.i', 'brand', 'dialog', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'shame', 'films', 'narrative', 'so', 'utterly', 'plausible', 'Cody', 'bogus', 'dialog', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'film', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'prevent', 'really', 'getting', 'flick', 'shame', 'really', 'Juno', 'potentially', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'see']",Juno

I only chose it for 3 reasons: 1) it had Ellen Page, 2) J.K. Simmons, and 3) had a high IMDb rating of 8.4 at the time of this writing.A story about a teen getting pregnant, and how she deals with it- can't you do something with that premise? It's like the creators were more concerned with showing off their cool, modern dialogue they wrote for the movie, than the actual story itself. I was amazed at how many scenes could go by, and how much TALKING could be done by the characters, without anything interesting ever developing in the movie. I mean you literally have these scenes that go on for minutes, and it's showing all these inconsequential things that don't develop character or introduce the next beat to the story. I remember watching every scene and feeling like there was something that was about to happen, a lot of potential energy, but it goes nowhere. There were moments that were interesting to watch, like between Ellen Page and the lady's husband, which were well acted and genuine, but again, it's like the focus of these scenes are to show just how 'cool' these characters are, and it's at the expense of substance and realism.My 4 cents:--There's nothing worse than a movie that's supposed to be a comedy but not funny at all.--Cool, Ellen Page plays the same character she played inHard Candy, even had the red hoody. That's where the comparisons stop between the two movies.--Jennifer Garner's facial reactions...failed. That was stupid and overdone. You got the camera showing her confused reactions and expressions to what Ellen Page was saying or doing, with this feeling that we as the audience are in the ""know"" of some joke, and her character is left out and doesn't get it, so we are laughing along with Ellen Page's character, except...there's no JOKE. There's nothing. So basically all you've got is this airheaded looking woman overacting and doing exaggerated contortions to her face, and it's just embarrassing and awkward.--The only pop culture reference that was missing out of this movie was the word ""Ebay.""

1117568,A1129LM24YWSZV,B000YABYLA,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[2, 2]","I thought Juno was a sweet film. The movie tells the story of Juno (played exquisitely by Ellen Page), a 16-year-old girl who gets pregnant. At first, Juno tries to arrange a ""hasty abortion,"" but she finds that she can't go through with it. Then, deciding to give the baby up for adoption, she looks through a local Penny Saver and finds the perfect couple in search of a baby - Vanessa (Jennifer Garner in a pitch-perfect, heartbreaking turn) and Mark (Jason Bateman, dead-on as always).Juno meets with the couple and makes all the necessary plans to have them adopt the baby. She feels secure in the knowledge that these two people will give her baby the perfect life.But when Juno begins to notice the cracks in her dream of perfection, she begins doubting everything - love, the ability of a couple of stay together, her choice to give her baby up, and her own feelings for Bleeker (Micheal Cera), the baby's father.I honestly think there are NO bad performances in this movie. Even the small parts are rendered with reality and depth of thought. J.K. Simmons is wonderful as Juno's dad, and ditto for Alison Janney as her stepmom. It's really an ensemble piece, with the four principles - Page, Garner, Bateman, and Cera - doing most of the heavy lifting. Page shines, delivering the types of lines you've never heard ANYONE really say with amazing credibility.And, a note - in most movies, scenes that are the least bit tense are far overblown for ""dramatic"" value. Chracters cry, scream, storm off, do a bunch of stupid stuff. And I don't doubt that there are some people who handle stressful situations that way. But there are plenty of us who try to maintain some shred of self-control and attempt to make the best of the hand we are dealt. This movie is about people like that.When Juno tells her parents she's pregnant, there's no histrionic fall-out. Sure, they are disappointed. Sure, they let her know that. She's disappointed in herself. But she's also made a decision, and she has a responsible plan to deal with the result of her irresponsibility. It's characters like this that make you want to keep going to see movies.

Loved the acting.  Ellen Page was super; she is cute, and her character was funny, quirky, and different.  She knew she was different and it didn't bother her.The acting of Allison Janney and J. K. Simmons as Juno's parents was superb.  They were also funny, supportive, and when told Juno is pregnant, they were really calm!!!  Too calm?  Had my young daughter come to me and told me she was pregnant, I would not have handled it as calmly and well as the MacGuff's did.  Perhaps they are better people than I am?  Anyway, I would have totally supported my daughter and been there for her every step of the way -- however, I KNOW I would have totally freaked out when told the news.  Maybe that is just me --What I didn't enjoy about the movie was how Juno -- at first -- seemed uneffected by being pregnant.  How she referred to the baby as IT -- how she seemed to have no restrictions in her young life.What I liked about the movie was how, after a while, Juno wanted to find the PERFECT and RIGHT family for her baby.  I liked how Juno could not get an abortion.  I liked how her family stood by her and were there for her.  I liked that Juno cried after she gave birth and gave the baby up.I would think this movie does not sensationalize getting pregnant young.  I think this movie was entertaining and full of good points; showing young girls that being pregnant and having a child is a huge commitment; one they need to be ready for.  Juno did show this and was also entertaining and had some good family values.  Being there for each other is so important, right?I would recommend JUNO and am glad that I FINALLY sat down and watched it!

1117579,AEXJ2LGP8PC5,B000YABYLA,peejay,"[1, 2]","I'm probably the last person in America to see this movie, but it finally came through Netflix. I kind of liked it, but I think it was pretty lightweight. For one thing, Juno herself had a ridiculous amount of ""self-agency."" She is the one who decides to have sex (though she apparently didn't have the foresight to use contraception), she's the one who decides to have the baby and, finally, to give it up for adoption. Just from my own perspective, I don't see this a lot in the real world. First of all, a lot of teenagers, especially girls, kind of ""fall into"" sexual activity rather than straightforwardly seek it out. And in the same way, they often ""fall into"" parenthood. From what they've told me, and I've talked to a lot of them as a former L&D; nurse, they often say something along the lines of,  ""Well, the pregnancy wasn't planned, but it wasn't exactly unplanned either"" (direct quote from a 14-year-old). This attitude is pretty typical. I just don't see many young girls as having the drive and self-awareness of Juno (of course, there are exceptions).Also, Juno's family is there in the background, but you don't get any sense at all that they have affected her decisions. But in reality, the family and the family's attitude has a lot of influence in how the girl views her pregnancy and the decisions that she makes about it. In some cases that can be a good thing, but there can also be a lot of force used against girls--psychologically, if not physically--and that can be very destructive. If the girl is forced into a specific decision, while it might ease the situation temporarily with her family, I think the psychological consequences over the long term are much more negative for her. Juno's family is rather too rare in their immediate supportiveness and acceptance--it's great, but not the usual case.Another thing that was bothersome about the movie was the way Juno referred to ""it,"" or this ""thing."" It implies that teenage girls don't really bond with their babies, which a) I don't think is typically the case, but which b) supports the end of the movie when Juno and her boyfriend don't spend time with the baby (he doesn't even see it), which I find pretty unbelievable. I'm not saying that there aren't cases where people might not want to see the baby, but the movie kind of implies that Juno, who has opted for a traditional closed adoption, has solved her ""problem"" now that the baby is gone from her life. It just doesn't seem very realistic, in that Juno was not an abuse case or a rape victim, that Juno wouldn't continue to wonder about her baby (and even abuse and rape victims will continue to wonder, I think, but might have more conflicted feelings about having a relationship with a child given up for adoption). She may not want to be a big part of the child's life, but she will always be in some sense, that child's mother, and giving the baby away for adoption doesn't erase that history.Finally, to the adoptive family. Of course, the guy turns out to be kind of immature, and that is what it is, but I have to say, I could barely see anything at all about theadoptive mother that I would find attractive. She just seemed so materialistic, emotionally shut down, and controlling. Yes, Juno sees her playing with a kid in the mall but that's about the only time you see anything attractive in her character. (Oh, and the scene where she talks to Juno's stomach in the mall--really??? Kind of over the top.)In conclusion, I guess my main complaint is that I found the whole movie to be very unpsychological. Yes, of course, it's Hollywood, but really the characters and the situations were just a little too pat. In the richest movies and literature, you can watch them or read them over and over again and get something new each time. This movie was basically a one-view deal.",3,"Okay, but lacking in many ways",1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,3832,"[""'m"", 'probably', 'last', 'person', 'America', 'see', 'movie', 'finally', 'came', 'Netflix', 'kind', 'liked', 'think', 'was', 'pretty', 'lightweight', 'one', 'thing', 'Juno', 'had', 'ridiculous', 'amount', 'self-agency', 'one', 'who', 'have', 'sex', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'foresight', 'use', 'contraception', 'one', 'who', 'have', 'baby', 'finally', 'give', 'up', 'adoption', 'Just', 'own', 'perspective', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'lot', 'real', 'world', 'First', 'all', 'lot', 'teenagers', 'especially', 'girls', 'kind', 'fall', 'sexual', 'activity', 'rather', 'straightforwardly', 'seek', 'out', 'same', 'way', 'often', 'fall', 'parenthood', 'what', ""'ve"", 'told', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'lot', 'former', 'L', 'D', 'often', 'say', 'something', 'lines', 'Well', 'pregnancy', 'was', ""n't"", 'planned', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'unplanned', 'direct', 'quote', '14-year-old', 'attitude', 'pretty', 'typical', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'young', 'girls', 'having', 'drive', 'self-awareness', 'Juno', 'course', 'are', 'exceptions', '.Also', 'Juno', 'family', 'there', 'background', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'have', 'affected', 'decisions', 'reality', 'family', 'family', 'attitude', 'lot', 'influence', 'how', 'girl', 'views', 'pregnancy', 'decisions', 'cases', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'there', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'lot', 'force', 'used', 'girls', 'psychologically', 'not', 'physically', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'destructive', 'girl', 'forced', 'specific', 'decision', 'might', 'ease', 'situation', 'temporarily', 'family', 'think', 'psychological', 'consequences', 'long', 'term', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'negative', 'Juno', 'family', 'rather', 'too', 'rare', 'immediate', 'supportiveness', 'acceptance', 'great', 'not', 'usual', 'case.Another', 'thing', 'was', 'bothersome', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'Juno', 'referred', 'thing', 'teenage', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'bond', 'babies', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'typically', 'case', 'b', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'Juno', 'boyfriend', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'baby', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'find', 'pretty', 'unbelievable', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'are', ""n't"", 'cases', 'where', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'baby', 'movie', 'kind', 'implies', 'Juno', 'who', 'opted', 'traditional', 'closed', 'adoption', 'solved', 'problem', 'now', 'baby', 'gone', 'life', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'realistic', 'Juno', 'was', 'not', 'abuse', 'case', 'rape', 'victim', 'Juno', 'would', ""n't"", 'continue', 'wonder', 'baby', 'even', 'abuse', 'rape', 'victims', 'will', 'continue', 'wonder', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'more', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'having', 'relationship', 'child', 'given', 'up', 'adoption', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'big', 'part', 'child', 'life', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'sense', 'child', 'mother', 'giving', 'baby', 'away', 'adoption', ""n't"", 'erase', 'history.Finally', 'adoptive', 'family', 'course', 'guy', 'out', 'be', 'kind', 'immature', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'could', 'barely', 'see', 'anything', 'theadoptive', 'mother', 'would', 'find', 'attractive', 'just', 'seemed', 'so', 'materialistic', 'emotionally', 'shut', 'down', 'controlling', 'Yes', 'Juno', 'playing', 'kid', 'mall', 'only', 'time', 'see', 'anything', 'attractive', 'character', 'Oh', 'scene', 'where', 'Juno', 'stomach', 'mall', 'really', 'Kind', 'top', 'conclusion', 'guess', 'main', 'complaint', 'found', 'whole', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'unpsychological', 'Yes', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'characters', 'situations', 'were', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'pat', 'richest', 'movies', 'literature', 'can', 'watch', 'read', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'get', 'something', 'new', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'basically', 'one-view', 'deal']",Juno
1117580,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000YABYLA,Peter Shermeta,"[7, 10]","At 16 Juno MacGuff is into 70s Punk Rock and Slasher films; she lives with her Dad, Stepmom and half-sister; she is a junior in high school; oh, and she's pregnant. Juno tells the story of the girl by the same name as she faces the choice of how to handle her situation. She is not married to, or even dating the baby's father. She is, as already mentioned, only 16 years old. She makes an interesting decision and the movie goes from there.Rarely will I address the soundtrack or the casting of a movie. I normally tune out the music (sorry for the pun) and will address only individual casting decisions. I have no choice but to talk about both here.Music is one of the comforting, yet (at times) conflict-inspiring, elements in Juno. With it being so important to characters, it is only appropriate that more attention be given to the soundtrack. The music was not ambient noise; it was used almost as a narrative technique and also to ease transitions between scenes. Music played a key role in the film and was used perfectly throughout.I cannot remember the last movie I saw where there was not a person out of place. Each person who participated in Juno seemed perfect for his or her role.Ellen Page (Juno) showed a lot of versatility as the movie's title character. She was always in control of the role, even when it meant playing someone so conflicted. Juno was strong, but vulnerable. She was smart, but ignorant. She was mature, but too young to know any better. Her personality was abrasive, which was not eased with the amount of slang that she piled on to every conversation early in the movie. But that changed. As the movie went on, Juno did what 16-year-old girls do: she grew up.I had not experienced the ""magic"" of Michael Cera until Juno. He has received such an incredible amount of praise from his role on ""Arrested Development"" and his part in Superbad, but I never watched the former and he did not impress me in the latter. But in Juno he was perfect. However, I sure hope I am not the first person to point out the stark similarity in his performances. Beware the typecast Michael, even though it is probably too late.Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner deserve some praise for selling their parts so well. And while everyone was so good, one person rose above the rest: J.K. Simmons, who played Juno's father. He was a lot of the movie's comedic relief, but that was such a special character for what his relationship meant to Juno. My appreciation wasn't entirely for the part, J.K. seemed to bring something extra to the it. His performance was one of my favorites of the year.From my -- however limited -- experience, Juno was an original story with a unique perspective on one pregnant teen. The story flirted with ""afternoon special,"" but never went over the edge. Any scene which could have led to sappy clich&eacute; was immediately steered clear, usually with humor. While I would not classify Juno as a ""comedy,"" it definitely had some of the most genuinely funny dialogue I have heard. As the credits roll you will find that Juno was a story you would not normally snuggle up to, but preconceived notions be damned! Both touching and funny, Juno was a very good movie.",5,This one deserves every award it wins.,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,3204,"['16', 'Juno', 'MacGuff', '70s', 'Punk', 'Rock', 'Slasher', 'films', 'Dad', 'Stepmom', 'half-sister', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'oh', 'pregnant', 'Juno', 'story', 'girl', 'same', 'name', 'choice', 'how', 'handle', 'situation', 'not', 'married', 'even', 'dating', 'baby', 'father', 'already', 'mentioned', 'only', '16', 'years', 'old', 'interesting', 'decision', 'movie', 'there.Rarely', 'will', 'address', 'soundtrack', 'casting', 'movie', 'normally', 'tune', 'out', 'music', 'sorry', 'pun', 'will', 'address', 'only', 'individual', 'casting', 'decisions', 'have', 'choice', 'talk', 'here.Music', 'one', 'comforting', 'yet', 'times', 'conflict-inspiring', 'elements', 'Juno', 'being', 'so', 'important', 'characters', 'only', 'appropriate', 'more', 'attention', 'be', 'given', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'was', 'not', 'ambient', 'noise', 'was', 'used', 'almost', 'narrative', 'technique', 'also', 'ease', 'transitions', 'scenes', 'Music', 'played', 'key', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'used', 'perfectly', 'throughout.I', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'last', 'movie', 'saw', 'where', 'was', 'not', 'person', 'place', 'person', 'who', 'participated', 'Juno', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'role.Ellen', 'Page', 'Juno', 'showed', 'lot', 'versatility', 'movie', 'title', 'character', 'was', 'always', 'control', 'role', 'even', 'when', 'meant', 'playing', 'someone', 'so', 'conflicted', 'Juno', 'was', 'strong', 'vulnerable', 'was', 'smart', 'ignorant', 'was', 'mature', 'too', 'young', 'know', 'better', 'personality', 'was', 'abrasive', 'was', 'not', 'eased', 'amount', 'slang', 'piled', 'conversation', 'early', 'movie', 'changed', 'movie', 'went', 'Juno', 'did', 'what', '16-year-old', 'girls', 'do', 'grew', 'up.I', 'had', 'not', 'experienced', 'magic', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Juno', 'received', 'incredible', 'amount', 'praise', 'role', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'part', 'Superbad', 'never', 'watched', 'former', 'did', 'not', 'impress', 'latter', 'Juno', 'was', 'perfect', 'However', 'sure', 'hope', 'am', 'not', 'first', 'person', 'point', 'out', 'stark', 'similarity', 'performances', 'Beware', 'typecast', 'Michael', 'even', 'probably', 'too', 'late.Jason', 'Bateman', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'deserve', 'praise', 'selling', 'parts', 'so', 'well', 'everyone', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'one', 'person', 'rose', 'rest', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'who', 'played', 'Juno', 'father', 'was', 'lot', 'movie', 'comedic', 'relief', 'was', 'such', 'special', 'character', 'what', 'relationship', 'meant', 'Juno', 'appreciation', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'part', 'J.K.', 'seemed', 'bring', 'something', 'extra', 'performance', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 'year.From', 'however', 'limited', 'experience', 'Juno', 'was', 'original', 'story', 'unique', 'perspective', 'one', 'pregnant', 'teen', 'story', 'flirted', 'afternoon', 'special', 'never', 'went', 'edge', 'Any', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'led', 'sappy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'was', 'immediately', 'steered', 'clear', 'usually', 'humor', 'would', 'not', 'classify', 'Juno', 'comedy', 'definitely', 'had', 'most', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'have', 'heard', 'credits', 'roll', 'will', 'find', 'Juno', 'was', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'normally', 'snuggle', 'up', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'be', 'damned', 'touching', 'funny', 'Juno', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie']",Juno
1117581,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B000YABYLA,P. Hardy,"[3, 4]","There was a lot of hype buzzing around this movie back in 2007 and then 2008 when ""Award Month"" came around in January and February. Nevertheless, I, like I usually do, wrote it off as just another ""Indie"" movie not worth the weight in merit or anything else, even if I was curious enough to admit that I wanted to see it myself. So somewhere at the end of December I scrounged up some money and went to see the movie in the theaters.As I sat there and watched it, two things occurred to me; (1): The movie wasn't half-bad, it was actually entertaining and different outlook on teenage pregnancy. (2): I wanted to strangle whomever thought it was good idea to subject the audience to the terror that was aptly named ""Indie-music"" throughout the entire movie instead of investing into finding a composer to create a score --- hopefully not akin to Thomas Newman`s score for ""Pay it Forward"". And if there was one... I didn't hear it.Anyhow, Juno follows the story of a sardonic [and easy-going] teenager, Juno MacGuff (""X-Men"" - [The Last Stand`s], third shadowcat, Elle Paige), whom, after taking at least three pregnancy tests (aided by entire gallon of Sunny-Delight) -- must comes to grips with the fact that a night of first-time sex with ""boyfriend"" Paulie Bleeker, has lead to her inevitable pregnancy. She contemplates getting an abortion, but a moment of mortality hits her and she decides to keep the baby. After telling her father, Mac (J.K Simmons) and step-mother Brenda (Allison Janney), her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) suggests to put the baby up for adoption. Enter Mark and Vanessa Long (Jennifer Garner), a couple seeking a child to love and raise, as they apparently cannot conceive one of their own. This series of events had Juno contemplating her relationship with her ""boyfriend"" Paulie, creating a friendship between herself and the Longs, and dealing with the leering eyes of her fellow schoolmates... Among other things.Simply put, I did enjoy this movie. Its probably one of the most refreshing movies in 2007 that I've seen, next to Waitress, which you just have to see (Keri Russell is just amazing). Both these movies are a 100 times better in quality and humor, compared to that grossly overrated debacle of a movie starring Katherine Heigl, which I will not utter here. Diablo Cody manages to create a storyline concerning teen pregnancy that doesn't become a clich&eacute; within itself; The characters don't make a big drama out of the fact Juno has gotten herself pregnant. Juno herself doesn't whine about this fact; She has no big plans that were suddenly ruined by this turn of events, nor does she even fret about her education or her status in school. Her parents don't even act like it's the end of the world, they just help her whenever the help is needed and give out advice when its needed.The relationship's between the characters are believable and never feel rehearsed. I especially love, how Garner's character -- a obvious preppy, and a slightly uncomfortable with Juno at first -- develops throughout the movie. Jason Bateman's Mark Long, at first, is a pretty interesting guy, who at first seems like the husband under the suppressive directive of his wife [if you get my meanin']. But as the movie goes on, it turns out that's just the opposite and not even the vice-versa. The humor is sarcastic and sometime's witty. Performances are fresh, especially from Ellen Paige.She was one of the main reasons I really didn't want to see this movie; I didn't enjoy her performance in X3, and I thought she was just plain overrated in Hard Candy. But thankfully, Ellen Paige manages to breathe life into a quirky character that would've otherwise been a product of watching too much Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Gilmore Girls (two perfect examples of sardonic characters, who drawl in the monotone and use sarcasm daily), and thus just a carbon copy full of lines worthy of Whedon-isms. Besides 13 Going on 30, I've never really watched a movie where I enjoyed Jennifer Garner's performance. Even if she's in this movie very little, most of the time, she is also another good reason to see this movie. The montage featuring her character (whose face you never see until she greets Juno and Mac MacGuff) sprucing up her house, herself, and placing parenting/baby magazine's on the coffee table to showcase her devotion in Juno's decision to help her achieve motherhood --should she agree-- give you insight into what kind of her person she is on the surface, but she's much more underneath. Her awkwardness around children in one scene reminded me of myself (I haven`t been a kid in so long (four years), its weird to be on the other side of the looking glass now).Now for the movies downsides: Juno's replay value is very little. I thought watching this movie a second time would be like watching any other movie. However, as I sat through the first half-hour, I found myself getting bored and my attention was wandering elsewhere. So for me, its not a movie you watch again. Diablo's dialouge in mosts parts, were just plain silly (and obviously inspired by Joss Whedon's ability to create some quirky dialouge or catchphrases that only works on TV), and sometimes overbearing. As I said before earlier, the ""Indie""/pop music was really lost on me. Its not my kind of music and honestly, its just terrible. It hurts my ears. Why on earth would I want to listen to a ""singer"" drawl on with lyrics that make absolutely not seen whatsoever, with instrumentals that stirs nothing within me? All in all, Juno turns out to be a very entertaining movie that doesn't make a big deal out of the subject matter its covering.

1117582,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B000YABYLA,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","I'm not really surprised that this film was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.  I'm more surprised by the films it was matched up against in that catagory (look up John Stewart's comments about this from when he hosted the Oscars in 2008 as I cannot do them justice.)  Ellen Page, at the time a fresh face in my book, played a teenaged girl who could never be fit into any molds or stereotypes or anything else of the like.  While Juno's friend Leah, played by Olivia Thirlby, had some actions and dialog that felt contrived, Ms. Page's Juno was witty and alive to the point where you have to wonder if there even was ever a script or if this young woman is just amazing at improvising and reacting perfectly to everything going on around her.  Having Allison Janney and J. K. Simmons as the lead's parents was a stroke of pure genius as I am a huge fan of both of these talented individuals, though I wish Mr. Simmons let his character out of his shell a bit more like he did in the Spider-Man movies.  As for Michael Cera, he played the lovable awkward kid that you just can't help but root for and played him well.  Come on, Paulie!  Get your girl!  I don't know if this was intentional, given that I've now watched this movie through to the end and am writing this review about it, but there was definetly an awkwardness between Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman right from the beginning...and not in a good way.  Also, Mr. Bateman wasn't funny.  I cannot recall him being at all funny in this rather light-hearted film.  Jennifer Garner was just awkward, period...and again, not in a good way.  But now that I'm done nit-picking, I'll say that this is a great film that takes a different look at a plot seen so often before.

Yet its his direction that often makes this work so well.  Juno is Reitman's second feature.  Like his first feature, ""Thank You For Smoking,"" he's dealt with the task of taking a hot button issue, making it funny, and thereby not making it an issue.  This is why Juno works - And it's the team of Reitman, Cody, and Paige that make the whole thing come together.The script reminds of a Kevin Smith script for a slightly younger less stoned generation.  That is to say that the dialogue is hip, sharp, and quick.  Not only is it fun and reverent, but it doesn't drag.  Some people have griped about the unnatural way people talk in this film and that's when you have to looks at some of the best comedy scripts in recent years and you realize that writers like Cody and Smith carve out their own worlds in their stories.  It feels natural in the world of Juno that Juno can quip at the store clerk about her pregnancy test and he'll give a clever quip back.That actors in this movie bring Cody's clever dialogue to life.  While Ellen Paige carries a lot of the scripts weight, she's also supported by wonderful character actor JK Simmons as Juno's father.  In all the fun, the relationship with Juno's family is addressed very sincerely.What makes the film work above all things though is how, as stated earlier, this is not a movie about teen pregnancy.  Think of it as a device and you'll get the politics out of your system.  Cody's script is more about love, friendship, and maturity.  The film is a feel good film, but the relationships in the film are complex.  Cody's script and Reitman's direction keep you interested til the end giving a very satisfying conclusion.",5,Feel Good Fun All Over,1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,1917,"['Ellen', 'Paige', 'accolades', 'performance', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'story', 'stripper', 'turned', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'screenwriter', 'have', 'garnered', 'attention', 'public', 'director', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'less', 'less', 'kudos', 'work', 'movie', 'direction', 'often', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Juno', 'Reitman', 'second', 'feature', 'first', 'feature', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'dealt', 'task', 'taking', 'hot', 'button', 'issue', 'making', 'funny', 'thereby', 'not', 'making', 'issue', 'why', 'Juno', 'team', 'Reitman', 'Cody', 'Paige', 'make', 'whole', 'thing', 'come', 'together.The', 'script', 'reminds', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'script', 'slightly', 'younger', 'less', 'stoned', 'generation', 'say', 'dialogue', 'hip', 'sharp', 'quick', 'Not', 'only', 'fun', 'reverent', ""n't"", 'drag', 'people', 'have', 'griped', 'unnatural', 'way', 'people', 'talk', 'film', 'when', 'have', 'looks', 'best', 'comedy', 'scripts', 'recent', 'years', 'realize', 'writers', 'Cody', 'Smith', 'carve', 'out', 'own', 'worlds', 'stories', 'natural', 'world', 'Juno', 'Juno', 'can', 'quip', 'store', 'clerk', 'pregnancy', 'test', ""'ll"", 'give', 'clever', 'quip', 'back.That', 'movie', 'bring', 'Cody', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'life', 'Ellen', 'Paige', 'lot', 'scripts', 'weight', 'also', 'supported', 'wonderful', 'character', 'actor', 'JK', 'Simmons', 'Juno', 'father', 'fun', 'relationship', 'Juno', 'family', 'addressed', 'very', 'sincerely.What', 'film', 'work', 'things', 'how', 'stated', 'earlier', 'not', 'movie', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'Think', 'device', ""'ll"", 'get', 'politics', 'system', 'Cody', 'script', 'more', 'love', 'friendship', 'maturity', 'film', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'relationships', 'film', 'are', 'complex', 'Cody', 'script', 'Reitman', 'direction', 'keep', 'interested', 'end', 'giving', 'very', 'satisfying', 'conclusion']",Juno

What makes this film so good is that it is fresh, like life, and doesn't attempt to preach about anything. Yes, a teenage girl gets pregnant accidentally and the story is about what she does about it. I liked the unexpected turns the film takes.  I liked the way most of the characters are portrayed as humans, with good and not-so-good qualities.  The dad is maybe the most saintly but he is sufficiently scruffy to still be likeable.  The step-mom is interesting because she's initially presented as someone very uncool --she loves dogs and in a manicurist--but she turns out to be incredibly strong and supportive of Juno, even as she keeps her own sharp tongue.  It was the most likeable character I've seen Allison Janney portray in a while--usually she's stuck with really unpleasant, uptight types.My only problem was with Juno.  As many others have mentioned (check the reviews giving the lower scores) she is so excessively smart-mouthed that I actually gave up caring about her about halfway through the film.  She is 16, going on 38, and every word out of her mouth is so clever that it really is annoying.  I loved her boyfriend, Paulie, though. He is her opposite, a real dorky, awkward, sincere, not terribly cute kid.  Her girlfriend is great too--not nearly as clever but with a lot of enthusiasm.The married couple who seek to adopt Juno's baby are very well written and played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner.  Each of them has flaws and some viewers will side with one or the other.  I think the genius of the film is that they are both shown completely realistically.  I felt a lot of affection for both of them.  The relationship between Mark (Bateman) and Juno has struck some as inappropriate but it seemed very natural to me, and again, that's how life can happen.I loved the ending...it was not what I expected and it seemed very true and hearwarming.All in all, it's a very good film...I give it four and a half stars.",4,Surprisingly fresh and tender treatment of teen pregnancy,1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,2092,"['did', ""n't"", 'want', 'write', 'treatment', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'sociological', 'treatise', 'definitely', 'not', 'What', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'fresh', 'life', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'preach', 'anything', 'Yes', 'teenage', 'girl', 'pregnant', 'accidentally', 'story', 'what', 'liked', 'unexpected', 'film', 'liked', 'way', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'humans', 'good', 'not-so-good', 'qualities', 'dad', 'maybe', 'most', 'saintly', 'sufficiently', 'scruffy', 'still', 'be', 'likeable', 'step-mom', 'interesting', 'initially', 'presented', 'someone', 'very', 'uncool', 'dogs', 'manicurist', 'out', 'be', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'supportive', 'Juno', 'even', 'own', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'was', 'most', 'likeable', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'portray', 'while', 'usually', 'stuck', 'really', 'unpleasant', 'uptight', 'types.My', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'Juno', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'check', 'reviews', 'giving', 'lower', 'scores', 'so', 'excessively', 'smart-mouthed', 'actually', 'gave', 'up', 'caring', 'halfway', 'film', '16', 'going', '38', 'word', 'mouth', 'so', 'clever', 'really', 'annoying', 'loved', 'boyfriend', 'Paulie', 'though', 'opposite', 'real', 'dorky', 'awkward', 'sincere', 'not', 'terribly', 'cute', 'kid', 'girlfriend', 'great', 'too', 'not', 'nearly', 'clever', 'lot', 'enthusiasm.The', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'seek', 'adopt', 'Juno', 'baby', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'played', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'flaws', 'viewers', 'will', 'side', 'one', 'other', 'think', 'genius', 'film', 'are', 'shown', 'completely', 'realistically', 'felt', 'lot', 'affection', 'relationship', 'Mark', 'Bateman', 'Juno', 'struck', 'inappropriate', 'seemed', 'very', 'natural', 'again', 'how', 'life', 'can', 'happen.I', 'loved', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'seemed', 'very', 'true', 'hearwarming.All', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'give', 'four', 'half', 'stars']",Juno

1117593,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B000YABYLA,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[2, 5]","This film was talk about town because it tackles the hot topic of teenage pregnancy. Juno is 16 year old girl, curious about sex, who after one time experiment with her schoolmate finds out she is pregnant.  Juno is pretty, smart and has sarcastic sense of humor.  Her mother and father are divorced and remarried to other people.  While Juno lives with her father (somewhere in Midwest), her Mom has started her new family in Arizona and it is obvious that their relationship is distant and strained.  Juno's family is a typical lower class family.  Her father repairs heating and air conditioning, her stepmom is working as a nail technician while juggling her new family.  But they are all detached from the fact that Juno is approaching age when talking about sex and educating her about it long past due.  It is cute to see how her parents take her pregnancy in stride, but to me it is not believable that they would be so galant about it.  The wisecracking of young Juno makes her somewhat less appealing becuase she can be crass.  One almost does not want a girl like that to be a mother at all.  Sarcasm like that is underlining major unhappiness and babies sure can benefit from happy moms.  Besides, I do not believe that small town America talks the way most people talk and behave in this movie.  While the script adds on the entertainment value it just isn't real.  For some reason, I found soundtrack on thsi movie annoying.  I know that many people have found it cute becuase it is so off beat, but I like music that sounds pleasing, not baby talk bluring sounds with a cute background noise.

1117594,A39W3263A9HCMN,B000YABYLA,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[5, 6]","Back in 08, when the movie came out on DVD, there was a huge buzz about it winning best screenplay and, so I decided I should check it out.The movie is about a 16 year old girl named Juno MacGuff. I'm not kidding. I'm serious. Throughout the movie I tried to pretend that name wasn't the most pretentious female protagonist name I've ever heard but I failed. She talks like a real smartass and acts all cocky to people. She's 16 and is in love with Paulie Bleeker (again, another pretentious ""indie"" name). One day she finds out that she got pregnant from a time when she and Paulie had sex. She considers having an abortion, but after being forced to face the fact that once you make a decision it stays with you forever, she decides to come out about her pregnancy to her parents and give it up for adoption. She finds one family in a classified ad who has an infertile mother and goes to get to know them. She takes a keen kinship to the husband, who loves indie music and cinema, including one situation where they watch the 70s cheese horror flick ""The Wizard of Gore"". Then a bunch of drama and depressing indie pretentiousness ensues and... I... just... don't... freaking... care. The end.I didn't HATE this film. Some lines were funny and I liked some of the cast, including the guy who played Jameson from Spider Man, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman, who of course charms in each role. One particularly powerful scene was when Juno has an emotional breakdown in the van- Finally she acts instead of trying to be a teenager and spewing cocky words.To say the characters are cardboard is an understatement- they're TISSUE PAPER THIN. Juno is not likable at all. Why should I sympathize for her? She's just a smartassed cocky borderlining-on-bitch who has absolutely no reason to be in the story other than the fact that she's the protagonist and she's pregnant. And her constant pop culture references were don't help either. Paulie I have no respect for- come on, getting a girl knocked up before she's even old enough to drive has no respectability in it, and the movie tries to make me care about him by making him all ""cute"" and ""awkward"" but come on. Also, this film in a way almost glamorizes teen pregnancy- Their parents are cool with her being pregnant AT 16 (I've known people in this situation and trust me, their parents were the exact opposite of that).

And Juno happens to be surprisingly good.Juno is a simple and lovely film about a 16-year-old mother-to-be who has a limited number of people she can rely on in her new condition and limited number of options to resolve her situation: practically, abortion or adoption. Juno shows that with determination love and life are possible to maintain even in a hostile environment.I read through the 35 reviews (so far) and wish to address two of the critical reviews that do seem to carry valid points: 1. All males in the movie are completely immature and the only supportive people are females. But... this is with notable exception of the boyfriend's mom, a female school librarian, a female ultrasound technician and female schoolmates, and so it's not an anti-male/pro-female setup. 2. Adoption is presented as the noblest of options and simply ""keeping the baby"" in the family is never taken into consideration. However, the future surrogate mother is presented as someone truly able and deserving to adopt a baby. Thankfully, none of these points get politicized in the story; that's why I predict that Juno will not be getting an Oscar, although it certainly deserves a few. I guess these days Oscars (and Nobles) are reserved for individuals like Al Gore.There are instances of offensive language in Juno, but these are valid part of the plot.

Over the course of her nine month term she learns about the nature of love in many different guises, and ultimately, discovers her own means of happiness.This movie is full of fantastic actors giving excellent performances: Michael Cera proves he can play it sincere and straight after being hilarious in ""Superbad"",  Jason Bateman is a human and believable unhappy husband to Jennifer Garner's needy, driven wife, Allison Janney is excellent (as usual), and J.K. Simmons proves he's capable of much more depth and pathos than ""Spiderman"" would have you believe. But it's Ellen Page as the titular Juno that creates and maintains the balance of bizarre characters in this film: she's a remarkable actress giving an outstanding performance in this beautiful, offbeat film.Director Jason Reitman proves to be the perfect match for writer Diablo Cody's sensitive, fluid script, and ""Juno"" moves at an easy, relaxed pace - but it never sinks into boring or over-long. The dialogue is so Teen and so Now that it wouldn't be out of place annoying intelligent people in ""Not Another American Pie Slasher With Beer"" type movie, but here, thanks to the skill of all involved in ""Juno""'s production, it simply comes across as believable and real.Without describing the plot to you, there's not much else to say about ""Juno"": other than to recommend you go and see it - this is a cut above most coming-of-age tales.

I'm sure most people know the storyline by now you have a young teenage girl Juno who after having sex gets pregnant and now after a while of thinking it over decides to have the baby full term and than give the baby up to a surrogate couple.  For me I couldn't seem to care less what happened to Juno or the baby I know it sounds mean but the storyline they used has been done over many times and a lot more better than this trashy movie.  The soundtrack also was pretty pathetic except for one or two but all in all the songs they used by this one singer Kimya Dawson made me want to put this dvd in the garbage disposer.

1117601,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000YABYLA,Richard Ross,"[4, 4]","Just saw this film for the first time on DVD. I liked it a lot. I thought the performances were great from the supporting players like J.K Simmmons, Allison Janney, Olivia Thirlby, and the main characters of Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner were also very good. Ellen Page and Michael Cera are phenomenal in terms of their work Page getting more kudos obviously since the film is about her but Cera improves on crafting a good portrait of teen angst from Arrested Development to SuperBad to now Juno. Everyone knows the story Juno a spunky sixteen year old has sex with her track star best friend Paulie Bleeker (Cera) and becomes pregnant. Originally considering abortion she decides that she can't go through with it and settles on looking for couples hoping to adopt. She settles on the Lorings (Garner and Bateman) and decides that they are good and deserving people. The rest of the film is Juno adapting to being pregnant and trying to sort things out with Paulie who is obviously in love with her but she is not as quick to return his affections. Her dad and step mom (Simmons and Janney) are tough but loving of her and support her in whatever way they can. That was very refreshing to find in this movie that they don't make her feel ashamed and ridicule her on what a bad decision she has made. They initially voice their disapproval but ultimately take active stands in helping her get through this. Step mom tells off a snooty ultrasound technician who is quick to lump Juno into a class of irresponsible teenagers who find themselves pregnant, and Dad goes with her to meet the Lorings so that she won't be taken advantage of. Dad is also instrumental in helping Juno discover how she really feels about Paulie and giving her that needed advice that lets her know how she should tell Paulie. The subplot with Mark Loring and Juno did raise several questions for me as it did for other critics and reviewers. I know that in interviews writer Diablo Cody is very defensive about whether Mark is or isn't getting too close to Juno.  This was one big part of the script that I had a problem with. Not all of Cody's cool dialogue works but enough of it does and even for people who are miffed that her dialogue has been praised and singled out since the film opened in December the performances of Page and everyone else involved bring the realism and real emotion to the film that the dialogue takes away from. It's a great film with some great dialogue, brilliant acting from everyone involved, and a cool soundtrack. With all that being said Juno has been the most talked about film long before it even opened in theaters generating such buzz at film festival screenings. Diablo Cody has become a legend in the press who constantly point out her stripper and phone sex operator jobs which she worked at while penning this script. My point is that it is a film that is sure to disappoint some or annoy some just in terms of its hype. I have just finished reading Peter Travers review of the film on DVD and I think it is extremely true and indicative of the reactions to the film. Travers was championing the film when it opened theatrically and by the time Oscar noms came in he was commenting that the new found praise was starting a backlash against the film. He still sided with the film even then and didn't give in to the skeptics. The DVD release did rile him however and I agree. He maintains that the film is no longer the little indie that could but a Hollywood product based on the fact that you have to pay extra just to get featurettes that detail Cody and the cast and the packaging. I agree with that it sucks that you have to pay an additional six dollars just to get a little more than a half hours worth of featurettes. The single disc has plenty of good extras like commentary, deleted scenes, gag reels, auditions and so forth. Much like her working days you have to shell out to see Cody and I admit I did pay the extra six so I could view the nine minute featurette Diablo Cody is Totally Boss. Either way I like the film and I like Cody so the double disc was worth it but the single disc is also a very good deal for all the extras you get with it.",4,Even on DVD Juno still has people worked up,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,4183,"['Just', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'DVD', 'liked', 'lot', 'thought', 'performances', 'were', 'great', 'supporting', 'players', 'J.K', 'Simmmons', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'main', 'characters', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'terms', 'work', 'Page', 'getting', 'more', 'kudos', 'obviously', 'film', 'Cera', 'crafting', 'good', 'portrait', 'teen', 'angst', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'SuperBad', 'now', 'Juno', 'Everyone', 'story', 'Juno', 'spunky', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'sex', 'track', 'star', 'best', 'friend', 'Paulie', 'Bleeker', 'Cera', 'pregnant', 'Originally', 'considering', 'abortion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'looking', 'couples', 'hoping', 'adopt', 'Lorings', 'Garner', 'Bateman', 'are', 'good', 'deserving', 'people', 'rest', 'film', 'Juno', 'adapting', 'being', 'pregnant', 'trying', 'sort', 'things', 'out', 'Paulie', 'who', 'obviously', 'love', 'not', 'quick', 'return', 'affections', 'dad', 'step', 'mom', 'Simmons', 'Janney', 'are', 'tough', 'loving', 'support', 'way', 'can', 'was', 'very', 'refreshing', 'find', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'ashamed', 'ridicule', 'what', 'bad', 'decision', 'made', 'initially', 'voice', 'disapproval', 'ultimately', 'take', 'active', 'stands', 'helping', 'get', 'Step', 'mom', 'tells', 'off', 'snooty', 'ultrasound', 'technician', 'who', 'quick', 'lump', 'Juno', 'class', 'irresponsible', 'teenagers', 'who', 'find', 'pregnant', 'Dad', 'meet', 'Lorings', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'advantage', 'Dad', 'also', 'instrumental', 'helping', 'Juno', 'discover', 'how', 'really', 'Paulie', 'giving', 'needed', 'advice', 'know', 'how', 'should', 'tell', 'Paulie', 'subplot', 'Mark', 'Loring', 'Juno', 'did', 'raise', 'several', 'questions', 'did', 'other', 'critics', 'reviewers', 'know', 'interviews', 'writer', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'very', 'defensive', 'Mark', ""n't"", 'getting', 'too', 'close', 'Juno', 'was', 'one', 'big', 'part', 'script', 'had', 'problem', 'Not', 'Cody', 'cool', 'dialogue', 'works', 'enough', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'miffed', 'dialogue', 'been', 'praised', 'singled', 'out', 'film', 'opened', 'December', 'performances', 'Page', 'everyone', 'else', 'involved', 'bring', 'realism', 'real', 'emotion', 'film', 'dialogue', 'away', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'dialogue', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'cool', 'soundtrack', 'being', 'said', 'Juno', 'been', 'most', 'talked', 'film', 'long', 'even', 'opened', 'theaters', 'generating', 'such', 'buzz', 'film', 'festival', 'screenings', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'become', 'legend', 'press', 'who', 'constantly', 'point', 'out', 'stripper', 'phone', 'sex', 'operator', 'jobs', 'worked', 'penning', 'script', 'point', 'film', 'sure', 'disappoint', 'annoy', 'just', 'terms', 'hype', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'reading', 'Peter', 'Travers', 'review', 'film', 'DVD', 'think', 'extremely', 'true', 'indicative', 'reactions', 'film', 'Travers', 'was', 'championing', 'film', 'when', 'opened', 'theatrically', 'time', 'Oscar', 'noms', 'came', 'was', 'commenting', 'new', 'found', 'praise', 'was', 'starting', 'backlash', 'film', 'still', 'sided', 'film', 'even', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'skeptics', 'DVD', 'release', 'did', 'rile', 'however', 'agree', 'film', 'no', 'longer', 'little', 'indie', 'could', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'based', 'fact', 'have', 'pay', 'extra', 'just', 'get', 'featurettes', 'detail', 'Cody', 'cast', 'packaging', 'agree', 'have', 'pay', 'additional', 'six', 'dollars', 'just', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'half', 'hours', 'featurettes', 'single', 'disc', 'plenty', 'good', 'extras', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reels', 'auditions', 'so', 'forth', 'Much', 'working', 'days', 'have', 'shell', 'out', 'see', 'Cody', 'admit', 'did', 'pay', 'extra', 'six', 'could', 'view', 'nine', 'minute', 'featurette', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'Totally', 'Boss', 'way', 'like', 'film', 'like', 'Cody', 'double', 'disc', 'was', 'worth', 'single', 'disc', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'deal', 'extras', 'get']",Juno

1117604,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000YABYLA,RMurray847,"[3, 5]","I'm hoping JUNO helps make Ellen Page the star that HARD CANDY should have made her.  She was completely unknown to me when I went to see that harrowing piece, and her performance was Oscar caliber.  I've been eagerly awaiting more work from her, but other than a tiny part in X-MEN: LAST STAND, I've had a pretty long wait.But she totally steals JUNO...which is saying a lot, because almost everyone is pretty terrific in this highly entertaining film.  But Ellen Page is some sort of unique energy source.  She seems to do so little, but the tiniest facial tic or change in tone conveys so much.  She's clearly a super-intelligent actress and her characters are also intelligent (probably almost to the point of stretching credulity...but who cares, it's so much fun), and they are funny and in JUNO, sensitive.Juno is a sixteen year old who has just discovered she's pregnant, after one encounter with her longtime friend Bleeker (they are mostly just friends...not really girlfriend/boyfriend).  June at first considers abortion as her only option, but she quickly decides she'd rather carry the child and pass it on to a loving but needy couple for adoption.  She does this knowing full well that she'll be an object of much discussion at school, AND she'll have to tell her father (JK Simmons) and her step-mother (Allison Janney).  And she'll have to tell the baby's father (Michael Cera from SUPERBAD and ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT).She finds her immediate family to be shocked but supportive, and her dad comes with her to meet the couple Juno has selected (from the ""Penny Saver"" no less!).  These childless yuppies are played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, and at first we think Garner is a bit of a control freak, and Bateman is the ""cool"" one...but this movie plays with our expectations of this couple right from the start.  I won't say much more, because much of the richness of the film comes in the changes Juno sparks in this couple.Juno is a whip-smart almost loner, who we find early on, is probably secretly pining for the love of goofy Bleeker.  And Bleeker certainly loves his old friend...yet these two have never faced these feelings...because they are both so confounded by them.  Juno is accustomed to having her act very much under control, and I believe she has a hard time admitting she has feelings that make her vulnerable to another person.  And Bleeker (played sublimely by Michael Cera...who is now officially in danger of being typecast for the rest of his life) is just too shy, goofy and flummoxed to believe his feelings would ever be returned.There isn't a lot of plot to the film.  It follows Juno through her voyage of discovery, at the child growing inside her, at her own feelings towards the boy who may become the man in her life and at what she discovers about the family she wants to give her child to.  What makes JUNO so much fun is the crackling dialogue (from current hot screenwriter Diablo Cody) and the equally snappy performances.(I appreciated too that Juno made the choice not to have an abortion.  Not only would there have been no film if she had...but it was refreshing to see a major film character make the choice she did.  Not because she was against abortion, but because she was able to make a reasoned decision that was not only great for her child, but great for another couple and quite enriching for her.  It also serves as a reminder that there are other choices besides abortion or deciding to raise a child yourself.  I don't feel the film was trying to make a statement...except to say ""whatever you decide, think it through a little bit."")The dialogue is the kind that no one would ever speak in real life, yet it hews close enough to realistic that it becomes its own style of ""hyper-realism.""  Ellen Page has the aura of someone who might actually speak in this very cynical yet open and intelligent manner, and thus she pulls it off.  Therefore, everyone else (none of whom are quite so snappy as Juno) seems positively normal by comparison.  Thus, the dialogue works!The performances are very good as well.  As I said, Cera is wonderful at the type of part he plays...I hope he gets to stretch soon as an actor...but for now, seeing him work is a delight.  Janney is very good as the stepmother, who both loves and is exasperated by Juno.  Garner is touching in her smallish but important role, and Bateman brings interesting shadings to what could have been a one-dimensional role.  He underplays, and this is in keeping with the style of the film.  It's no wonder that his character and Juno's hit it off so well.But to me, other than Ellen Page, the MVP of the film is the always fantastic JK Simmons.  Can someone please sometime give this actor an award!!  From the over-the-top newspaper editor in the SPIDERMAN films, to the hilarious thief with irritable bowel syndrome in THE LADY KILLERS, to competent Dr. Skoda in ""Law and Order"" to the chilling white supremacist in ""Oz""...this guy may be the best character actor around.  He plays Juno's dad so well, and their scenes together have a true warmth that spreads to the whole film.  He's a blue-collar guy...no doubt perplexed by Juno's immense vocabulary and her way of speaking...yet we can also see in his manner that he's a big inspiration to how Juno turned out the way she did.  It's a well-written part, and he knocks it out of the park.The movie is not perfect.  Again, the wonderful screenplay is a bit mannered.  It struck me that way a Woody Allen or Neil Simon script might strike an audience...these characters are too witty to be believed.  So while I thoroughly enjoyed the script and while it was well-executed...it still did not 100% elude the ""hey, no one in real life would think to say that"" syndrome from time to time.  It would say it was more like 95% of the time.Jason Reitman (who also directed the excellent THANK YOU FOR SMOKING) keeps the film moving nicely...but he's not a super-inventive director.  He finds good scripts and a good cast (90% of the battle) but there's nothing inspiring about what he brings to the film as a crafter of beautiful imagery or masterful framing.  He lets his actors do great work, and that's most important.  Some day, I hope he tries his hand at something that doesn't really on Aaron Eckhart's or Ellen Page's masterful delivery.But this is certainly a film high on my list for 2007.  I truly love Ellen Page, and I predict some more great things for her.  Her performance alone makes the film worth seeing...but thank goodness there are so many other great things as well.",5,Witty script...and a PHENOMENAL performance from Ellen Page,1198627200,"12 26,

1117606,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000YABYLA,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 10]","Juno (Jason Reitman, 2007)For over a decade, Trainspotting has been the undisputed king of awful, unlistenable soundtracks. But now, along comes Juno, with a soundtrack so mind-numbing it makes Trainspotting's flatulent disc sound like the finest Merzbow. I mean, come on, they actually went out and hunted down the worst song the Velvet Underground ever recorded. (And for those who keep saying the songs fit with the character, would someone who idolizes Iggy and the Stooges really listen to that junk? Really? Honestly? Think about that for a while.)It's too bad, because the rest of the movie ranges from the not-too-terribly-awful to the brilliant. The brilliant can be summed up in two names: J. K. Simmons (Law and Order) and Allison Janney (The West Wing), who play the parents of the title character, and who are two of the out-and-out funniest characters I've seen on a screen for a long, long time. They absolutely steal the movie; no one else in it (including the usually wonderful Ellen Page as the title character) even comes close.Which brings me to the other end of the spectrum, because I spent much of the movie wondering how much Simmons and Janney were improvising; the rest of the script ranges from the awkwardly silly (""I rock a Harmony."" My god, do kids really talk like that these days?) to the embarrassing (""that's one doodle that can't be undid, home slice""-- note that no one has used the term ""home slice"" in at least ten years).But for all that, the reason I went to see this movie was Ellen Page, playing way out of type here-- a break from doing intense horror/thriller flicks like Hard Candy and An American Crime, I guess. To the extent it's possible to own a character with such terrible lines, Page does it, and to her credit manages to get through the whole film playing the character straight. This may be an even more impressive thing than carrying a character who's brilliantly written (Hard Candy's Hayley Stark, for example), and how much of the mannerisms of the character were written into the script and how much are Page's own work (or Reitman's) is subject to debate; I give Page the benefit of the doubt because she's proven herself such a strong actress in the past.An amusing little comedy, but pulling a Best Picture nomination over The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?

It's smart, sassy, funny and best of all refreshingly unsentimental.  Ellen Page plays Juno a sharp-tongued teen who finds herself in the family way after a little hanky panky in a chair with her lovably dweeby boyfriend played by Michael Cera. Juno even deposits ""the chair"" on her bfs' front lawn. The best part of the movie is neither teen wallows in self-pity or panic and Junos' father and step-mother take the news calmly without resorting to shreiking and hysterics but are supportive all the way.Juno decides to look for a married couple to adopt her baby and she finds a childless yuppie couple who are desperate to have a child especially the wife played by Jennifer Garner. Jason Bateman plays the husband who doesn't work but spends his day in his home studio waiting for his big break in the music business. This is where the movie seems to be on the way to creepy.  Both Juno and the husband like horror movies and rock bands but their tastes are different so they begin trading dvds and cds and Juno begins to spend a lot of time alone with Bateman. Then one day out of the blue he tells Juno he's going to divorce his wife. Because of the growing friendship between the husband and  Juno you start to think the movie is heading somewhere that happily doesn't.The neat thing about ""Juno"" is, it treats a serious subject-teen pregnancy-with a light touch and the movie turns out to be both funny and sweet-a little gem.

1117609,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000YABYLA,Robert Moore,"[7, 11]","There are many, many good things that one could say about JUNO, but they all have to begin and end with Ellen Page.  Mind you, this film features a very good cast and everyone excels in their role, but if Ellen Page is in the scene -- and she is in nearly every scene in the film -- she dominates everything.  As the wisecracking, (almost) unflappable, and very pregnant 16-year-old Juno, Ellen Page steals this movie.  She has already been nominated for or out and out won a number of awards for her performance in JUNO (including the Screen Actor's Guild and the Golden Globes -- she is considered a lock for an Oscar nomination), and seemed destined to sweep all awards for break out performance of the year.  She really is that good in this film.  I'd noticed Ellen Page before.  I first became aware of her in the third X-MEN movie, when she played my favorite X-Man, Kitty Pryde aka Shadowcat.  She did a great job in a pretty small role.  Later I saw her in the independent Canadian film WILBY WONDERFUL.  Most people will know her from her role in HARD CANDY.  But JUNO could be more than a breakout role for Page.  This could be the making of a legitimate star.  She is both extremely young and extremely talented.  If she wants to be, she could well be the next Winona Ryder.  The ""wants to be"" could be huge.  From interviews it doesn't sound like she especially wants a star career.  JUNO was not a Hollywood production, but was instead filmed in Vancouver.  In the past a number of Canadian actors have turned their backs on Hollywood and stayed largely north of the border (Paul Gross and Sarah Polley are just two actors I can think of who could have had big careers had they ""gone Hollywood,"" but instead fostered smaller but superb careers in Canada).  I would not be surprised if Ellen Page was one of those.  But I would also not be surprised if she gobbled up a score of very desirable roles for smart, sassy young women in the next several years.  One thing she certainly has going for her is versatility.  She has at age 20 already shown that she can excel in drama, comedy, and horror.  Her range as an actress seems unlimited.As great as Ellen Page is, much of her success has to be credited to Diablo Cody's incredibly witty script.  To be honest, this is not truly a great movie.  The central story isn't that substantial.  But a dominating lead performance stringing together an unending number of great one-liners can certainly give the appearance of greatness.  I don't remember the last time I saw a movie that had so many truly funny lines.  And for that Cody has to be given the credit.As mentioned above, the film has a great supporting cast.  I was especially impressed by Jennifer Garner, who plays what is largely an unsympathetic role (until fairly near the end of the film).  As the ""uncool"" half of the couple who plan on adopting Juno's child, she has to play completely against type.  As a huge ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT fan I was delighted to see both Michael Cera (for whom 2007 has been a very good year) and Jason Bateman together in the same film, though they didn't have any scenes together.  J. K. Simmons and Allison Janney were both wonderful as Juno's parents.  Rainn Wilson of THE OFFICE has a very small but memorable role as a convenience store clerk.One thing that struck me while watching this film is how few starring roles there have been for wisecracking young girls.  There have been scores of films featuring wisecracking teenage boys (one need only look back to SUPERBAD as a recent example).  But once one gets past JUNO and GHOST WORLD there aren't a huge number of comparable films for young girls.One other random comment.  There was a very strange moment in the film when I realized that every actor in the scene (excepting Jason Batman) had been in a major action movie or TV series.  This was when Juno and her father were meeting with the adopting couple and their lawyer for the first time.  Ellen Page had been in X3.  J. K. Simmons, who played her father, has memorably portrayed J. Jonah Jameson in the SPIDER-MAN movies.  Eileen Pedde, who played the Lorings' lawyer, is a regular on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA as Sgt. Mathias, a veteran marine.  And Jennifer Garner portrayed yet another Marvel superhero, Elektra, in a pair of films, as well as Sydney Bristow for five years on ALIAS.A couple of more random comments.  The opening credits are among the best I've seen in ages.  They apparently took photos of Eileen Page and digitized them somehow to produce an animated sequence.  Very compelling and quite unforgettable.  Finally, the film has a truly great soundtrack.  Almost every film these days has a great soundtrack, but this one was especially fine.  They use the music of Kimya Dawson pretty extensively (whose music, I must confess, has always underwhelmed me), but they also use a long string of gems by Belle and Sebastian, the Kinks, Buddy Holly, Sonic Youth, Mott the Hoople, and Cat Power for one of the best and most eclectic soundtracks I've heard.  They also name drop the Stooges, but alas use none of their or Iggy's songs.All in all, this is a really fine film.  I'm not sure it is a great movie, but there is no question that Ellen Page turns in one of the best performances of the year by any actor, male or female.  My best guess is that she will get nominated for an Oscar but will not win, though she probably deserves to.  The Academy tends to bless mediocrity, hates comedies, especially hates films dealing with culturally controversial topics (like teen pregnancy, though drug addiction is usually a ticket to a walk to the podium, so go figure), and usually rewards bloated, ""serious"" films.  But I'd be delighted if she defied tradition and won the Oscar.",5,A star is born,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,5755,"['are', 'many', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'JUNO', 'have',

1117610,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000YABYLA,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 4]","The thing that separates ""Juno"" from so many other films about teen pregnancy is that, in this case, the 16-year-old who finds herself in that predicament refuses to become a victim of her circumstances.  From the moment she confirms the unwelcome news, Juno studies her options - abortion, raising the child as a single teen parent, adoption - then takes matters into her own hands.  Like the Roman goddess who is her namesake, Juno is a bright, often sharp-tongued individual who prides herself on her observant cynicism and her way with a sarcastic quip.  However, she's not above appealing to the adults in her life when the problems of the world get to be too much for her (though, in some cases, the grownups are coping with more serious issues than she is).  Yet, Juno makes certain that it is she and she alone who will have the final say when it comes to determining the course of her own future and that of her child.""Juno"" is that rare low-budget, independent feature that finds unexpected success in the mainstream by striking a chord of recognition in audiences across the demographic spectrum.  First-time screenwriter Diablo Cody hits pay dirt with a clear-eyed, largely unsentimental script that is not afraid to go off in unexpected and interesting directions and that avoids patronizing its Middle American characters.  Juno's father and stepmother manage to take the news in stride, while the yuppie couple Juno alights on to be the child's adoptive parents are given a depth and complexity far beyond what a lesser writer might have afforded them.  Director Jason Reitman keeps the quirkiness to a minimum and allows the scenes to play out in a naturalistic, unhurried way.  Confident in the strength and appeal of his material, he lets the gentle human comedy speak for itself.In a star-making turn, young Ellen Page takes a daring approach to her character, often bringing Juno right to the brink of un-likeability, then pulling back at just the crucial moment, making us see how utterly likeable she truly is.  As the child's father, Michael Cera is virtually the same lovably passive nerd we found so endearing in ""Superbad,""  while J.K. Simmons and especially Allison Janney give rich shadings to Juno's supportive parents.  Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner also make their mark as the couple who post their picture in the ""baby wanted"" section of the local throwaway.""Juno"" faces the downside of any independent film that unexpectedly finds itself ripped from the confines of the art houses and suddenly duking it out at the multiplexes with all those high-budget, high-octane, testosterone-laden blockbusters - namely the risk of over-inflated expectations.  Thus, my advice is to look beyond all the hype and box office records and simply let ""Juno"" sneak up on and take a hold of you in its own quiet, inimitable fashion.

Many of these seem forced, out of place, and have a sour note quality.  However, this movie is being touted as the best movie of the year and in my opinion it deserves all of the praise and hype it is getting.  It is so good that it is hard to start describing why it is so good.The screen play and plot are relatively simple and uncomplicated and there are some scenes that could be improved but any weakness in the screenplay is more than offset by some of the scenes and lines that are some of the best I have seen in any movie in a long time.  Near the beginning we see the boys running track and we hear Juno comment that she loves watching their ""things flop up and down"" and ""all she can think of are all of those ""pork swords"".  We see the boys running throughout the rest of the movie and it is hard to erase this from your mind.  Then we have the fight over the senior prom.  Michael Cera's performance here as the wounded dad and exboyfriend is superb, of course Ellen Page does an outstanding job throughout the entire movie.  Another great scene is with J K Simmons (her dad) when she asks him if true and enduring love is possible.  Speaking from the perspective of a 40 year marriage his response was spot on -- a short but well done scene.Then we have the couple who are slated to adopt the child.  Jason Bateman as the prospective dad does an incredible job of showing his immaturity and self-centeredness.  His reaction when Juno calls him old and rejects him is truly excellent since so much of it is in his expression and body language.  Every single actor in this film did an outstanding job and Ellen Page and Michael Cera were the best I have seen in any movie this year.The camera work was excellent as was the direction.  The scene with the freight train was very symbolic and beautifully done just as the scene where Bateman bolts down the stairs to see Juno.  No words were needed -- great direction.I loved this movie but much of it hit too close to my youth and it left me sort of depressed even though it has a semi-happy ending.  I don't think this is a movie suitable for young children but I think it is wonderful for teens.  This is a great movie and should be a candidate for best movie.

There are plenty of other films that do the same thing and are never even considered for Oscars. Additionally, this movie's script ranges from the utterly typical to the overly thought-out in which case is equally un-Oscar worthy. What should be rewarded, instead, is consistency, and this movie lacks that in spades.Juno (Ellen Page) is a somewhat masculine and alternately strange 16 year old girl with the inability to understand herself and the people around her. She discovers she is pregnant with the child of an awkward friend (Michael Cera) and immediately decides to have an abortion. Without much consultation from the father of the baby, she heads down to the clinic to discover a schoolmate protesting the murder of babies that already have fingernails. Juno changes her mind, and with the help of her best friend (Olivia Thirlby) searches for needy couples in the Penny Saver. She finds her perfect match, a wealthy duo (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) who have been trying for years to conceive without any luck. Upon meeting them, she signs her baby away and that is that. However, a strange connection is formed between Juno and her future baby's daddy which throws a wrench into the situation.An entertaining though somewhat boring romp about teen pregnancy, Juno makes us laugh with its quips and wacky situations but it is hardly cutting edge. With funnier and more memorable movies like Saved! and Knocked Up coming before it, Juno is by now a typical story that cannot be redeemed with its slightly less typical characters. Enjoyable, yes, but outstanding, no.This DVD features some unfunny deleted scenes and gag reels.

I found myself wondering if this film considered itself something teens and adults alike should relate to, with all its witty banter and smarmy camaraderie, or should we embrace such situations exactly as Juno, with a removed understanding of our strengths and limitations and the knowledge that our actions stand to impact a great many others, potentially in wonderful and terrifying ways?Juno hits the mark, and it does so in a refreshingly smart way.

1117627,ASR6EDD3ES7JW,B000YABYLA,SteakSalad101,"[1, 1]","I have never been the only male person in a theater audience before. Ever. But now as I have gone to see ""Juno,"" I know what that feels like. From all the hype surrounding this movie, and Roger Ebert himself calling it the best movie of the year, I decided it would be worth walking down to my theater in below 20 degree weather to see it at a 2:45 matin&eacute;e on a lazy Sunday afternoon. So I did.First and foremost--the film is over-hyped, but I still loved it. Juno (Ellen Page) is a weird, abnormal, yet stunningly cute teenager who messes up and gets pregnant by her best friend Paulie (Michael Cera). After choosing not to abort the baby, she decides to find adoptive parents, but in turn must face being pregnant at school, at home with her parents, and of course, trying to balance the everyday challenges of teenage life. As expected, there are bumps along the way, and that's why I think Juno is not so much a movie about teen pregnancy and the dangers that come with it--but as a dramedy about growing up.There are a lot of original, fun, quirky ideas that come along with Juno--one, primarily, is Juno's character, who you can't help but love. She's weird and rebel, and doesn't try to be popular, yet of course, she gets some unwanted popularity eventually. Ellen Page does such a seamless job portraying the character, I would not be surprised if she was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Then we have Juno's best friend Paulie (who gets her pregnant), who is the nerdy, skinny kid who dominates the track team, plays guitar, and puts deodorant on his legs. The adoptive parents--Vanessa, the baby-obsessed lady who wants a child so bad she's ready to jump off a building, and Mark, the musically obsessed Sonic Youth lover who forms a friendship with Juno. I could go on and on and on but you get the picture...the film is quirky and lovable by everyone.The film has a very indie feel to it that is paired up with a cute, indie acoustic soundtrack that I absolutely loved. The acting is without question some of the best I've seen in 2007 films--the dialogue is very witty, quirky, and entertaining, and forces a smile upon your face. Ellen Page gives a phenomenal performance as the weird, pregnant Juno and she is paired with outstanding performances by Jason Bateman, who you might remember from Arrested Development, and Michael Cera. Unfortunately, though I really liked the film, it is extremely over-hyped. It does not deserve a Best Picture nomination and certainly not it's 8.4/10 rating on IMDb. The strongest point of Juno is its indie -feel and originality--the weakest, unfortunately, is the way it is executed. I can't help but think Jason Reitman, the director, sort of mishandled the film and couldn't decide on whether he wanted it to be a comedy or tragedy. Also the first half hour or so of the film is very, VERY slow and lacks charm that is found in the second half. The idea, story, and structure for Juno is absolutely brilliant--but it could've been handled so much better.Contrary to popular belief, Juno is not just for preppy teenage girls who have dumb boyfriends who want to knock them up. Like I said earlier, this is much more than a story about a pregnant teenager--it's a story about growing up and facing the world's challenges.

It is also one of the most realistic films about teenage life that I have ever seen. Ellen Page is amazing. I loved her in ""Hard Candy"" - her performance, not her character - and I loved her in this film as well. She IS Juno, and you care for this young lady and her ordeal. Ellen Page is an amazing actress, and I cannot wait to see her future films. The rest of the cast is also excellent. One thing that must be mentioned here is the writing. It is so funny and so honest, and all I have to say is that screenwriter, Diablo Cody, is a genius when it comes to words. Some people have said that this film is derivative of Wes Anderson's work, but I totally disagree. It is Jason Reitman's best film so far, and I liked this one better than ""Thank You For Smoking"". The music is also very quirky, and I liked it a lot...Please, do not miss the chance to see this one in the theatre! You will laugh your head off, and you will come out of it deeply moved.

Simmons20th Century Fox | 2007 | 96 min | Rated PG-13 | Released Apr 15, 2008Video:Video codec: MPEG-4 AVCVideo resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 1.85:1Audio:English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1English: Dolby Digital 5.1French: Dolby Digital 5.1Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles:English SDH, SpanishDisc:50GB Blu-ray DiscDigital copyThe Film 5/5Juno was nominated for four Oscars, winning for best original screenplay (Diablo Cody). It was a competitive year with No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood dividing six of the major categories between them, but Ellen Page was unlucky not to win in her category. Shot on a budget of $7.5 million, it made $143 million in the USA alone and a further $88 million worldwide.Director Jason Reitman was also responsible for Up in the Air in 2009, which, along with Juno, dealt with subjects in which I had very little interest. But Reitman's mix of drama and comedy works well in both movies and the witty dialogue drives both.Juno is funny throughout, but it's never dumb comedy and it never resorts to gross humor. The story works because we care about the characters and their one-liners fit both their personality and the situation. In short, it feels real. Many comedies assault the viewer with a stream of contrived jokes and it falls flat (for me at least).Juno MacGuff (Page) is 16 and newly-pregnant. We are shown a flashback showing how it happened and who the father is. It turns out to be one of her best friends, Paulie Bleeker (Cera). After telling him, she decides that an abortion is the best course of action, but she changes her mind following a visit to the clinic. She's a smart girl and feels capable of making her own decisions, eventually deciding that adoption may be the best thing for her and the baby.She finds potential parents in an ad and then has the task of telling her father (Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney) that she's pregnant. This is where the movie first defies our expectations. Instead of anger and shock, her parents are calm and accepting. They even joke about the situation when she reveals the father. It's so refreshing to see supportive parents rather than the usual stereotypes.Her father wants to go with her to meet the prospective foster parents, Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and Mark (Bateman). Vanessa desperately wants a baby and is skeptical that Juno will honor the agreement, while Mark is more relaxed about everything. He bonds with Juno when she sees his guitar and they end up singing together.Juno keeps in touch with the couple and forms a friendship with Mark because of their common love of music and movies. I particularly like this sequence because I'm passionate about both subjects and know the power of sharing and talking about such things. It's the main reason that I write about movies. Mark introduces her to Sonic Youth (my favorite band) and Juno shares some of her classic rock and punk albums. It seems that the two might enter into a more serious relationship.Her stepmother teaches her about food supplements and defends Juno when she goes to the hospital and is insulted by the ultrasound technician. It's further evidence that she'll be supported in her choices all the way.Bleeker's face lights up every time he sees Juno. Cera plays the part well and doesn't go over the top. It's a quiet and understated performance, but he makes it clear that she's special to him. She suggests that he date a different girl, but is angry when he does. The two have a showdown and it again becomes clear that they really feel something for each other.There's a touching scene in the shopping mall where Juno encounters Vanessa and sees her playing with a little girl. We see Juno forming the opinion that Vanessa will make a good mother. The scene develops with a meeting between the two in which Vanessa talks to Juno's belly.Her arrangement with Vanessa and Mark is threatened by one occurrence and we wonder how everything will turn out. I won't reveal that here, but it's a good resolution.Another great scene involves a chat between father and daughter. It's a potentially life-changing talk played perfectly by Page and Simmons. It sets into motion events that shape Juno's immediate future. Simmons is so talented. If I were a writer/director, one of the first things I would do is create a starring role for Simmons. He's made his mark with supporting roles, but has so much more to offer.As for Page, what a remarkable talent. She carried such films as Whip It and Hard Candy, and had a major supporting role in Inception. At 24, she has most of her career ahead of her and I'm excited to see how she develops. She's already capable of showing so much emotion and her comic timing is perfect. It will be fun to see what happens over the next decade.One important component of the movie is the soundtrack. Kimya Dawson contributes nine of the songs in the film and they fit the mood and Juno's character perfectly. There's a well-placed Kinks song and bands such as Cat Power and Belle & Sebastian also fit the mood. The highlight is Sonic Youth covering the Carpenters' Superstar, and it's an important part of the plot.Juno isn't a film that will appeal to everyone. Some argue that the dialogue isn't realistic, but I found it so. Who is it aimed at? Teens? Women? Pregnant girls? Many will write it off as falling into one of those categories. That would be a shame because it has a lot more to offer. I'm a 48-year-old man and I found it utterly charming, refreshing, intelligent and genuinely funny.There's a chance it may upset some people because it turns a serious situation into an amusing comedy. Is it saying that it's acceptable to be pregnant at 16? How would you feel as a parent who faced a similar situation? How would you feel if you were a pregnant teen and didn't receive that kind of support and understanding from your parents? I would hope that it can be taken for what it is; a fictional situation. It's more about how the characters react to the situation than anything else.Video Quality 4/5For such a low-budget movie, the look is surprisingly good. The transfer is clean and free from damage, colors are well-represented and detail is good in the vast majority of scenes. I can't quite justify a 4.5, but it's certainly worth a 4. Don't expect a visual feast and you should be pretty happy with the overall look.Audio Quality 4/5Juno is a dialogue-heavy movie that's quiet for the majority of its running time, but the sound still plays an important part. The songs are presented well and when sound is called for, such as in amplified effects in the clinic waiting room, it comes across convincingly.Special Features 5/5It's rare that I watch a movie and immediately tackle all of the special features, and even rarer to watch them again on subsequent viewings. Juno is an exception. I like this world and the quality of the extras makes it worth seeing them more than once, even though they are all in standard definition.Commentary with Jason Reitman and Diablo CodyDeleted Scenes (20:23) - It would be great to see an extended version of the film at some point and most or all of these scenes would fit well. My favorites include Juno singing a song about Paulie in a bar and her real thoughts about Sonic Youth.Gag Reel (5:11)Gag Take (1:57)Crew Music Video (3:12) - A song featuring members of the cast.Screen Tests (22:35) - See how Page, Cera, Thirlby and Simmons earned their roles.Way Beyond ""Our"" Maturity Level: Juno-Leah-Bleeker (8:59)Diablo Cody is Totally Boss (8:35) - Showing how Cody went from blogger to writing the screenplay.Jason Reitman for Shizz (8:08) - Showing how Reitman came to direct the movie.Honest to Blog!: Creating Juno (13:01) - Reitman, Cody and some of the cast talking about how the movie came to be made.Fox Movie Channel presents world premiere...Juno (5:26)Fox Movie Channel presents Casting Session: Juno (7:51)Watching Juno is like spending time with an old friend. It's warm and familiar and makes me grin throughout. I would like to see Juno at 26 to find out how her experiences and decisions shaped her life. If you like quirky, intelligent humor and good acting, Juno will probably work for you too.Overall score 5/5",5,I guess normalcy isn't really our style,1307232000,"06 5, 2011",2011,8331,"['Juno',

1117632,A359IT81FBX64Y,B000YABYLA,Steven Mason,"[6, 7]","The people who like Juno outnumber those who don't 3 to 1. I'm in the minority. At times it's cute and amusing, and the acting is good. It's a quirky story filled with quirky characters, but even with all the quirks it is neither complex nor endearing.Juno is a preternaturally intelligent, precocious, attractive 16-year-old teen who makes up her own rules. Apparently no one can control or even influence her, not her tough, gruff father, not her tough, gruff step-mother, not her school, not her best friend or her boyfriend. But before too long we discover that Juno cares too much, that her rude, tough, pushy, arrogant, disdainful, manipulative exterior is masking a real softie inside. How original is that?To mix things up a bit, in a transparent effort to make up something ""original"" about the story, Juno decides one day to have sex with her boyfriend. Keep in mind that the most endearing quality about the boyfriend is that he is a totally passive pushover and is easily manipulated by Juno. It is Juno's idea to have sex, and when Juno says she wants sex, the boyfriend, Bleeker, has little say in the matter. Appropriately enough, the seminal act, as it were, is concluded not by smoking cigarettes, but by eating Tic Tacs (one of the many quirks of the film). Of course it was unprotected sex, because as I said, Juno makes up her own rules.Juno gets pregnant and she decides to give the baby to a set of parents of her own personal choosing. Juno's father helps her with the interviews, apparently accustomed to letting his daughter have her way. Juno quickly finds the perfect couple, and she can't wait to dump the unwanted baby on them, almost as if she has found a family to take a pet dog she's had for a month and now has grown bored with. Throughout the pregnancy, Juno continues to be the rude, rule-breaking person she's always been, though here and there we see glimpses of her softer side. She mostly ignores her boyfriend, who never really was a boyfriend anyway.The rest of the story is quite boring, the end is quite silly. But the movie is too earnest to be a comedy, though I have no idea what it is being earnest about. I don't think it's necessary to say more, except that, in the end, after the baby has been given away, Juno inexplicably decides that she, at 16, is suddenly in love with Bleeker, and no one is more surprised than Bleeker himself. It seems that even though Juno prefers to make up her own rules and break everyone else's, there is, after all, one rule that she would like to believe in: the rule of happily ever after. And if that doesn't make sense after what I've described before, it's not supposed to. :-)For those of you looking for a good, earnest, quirky movie about first love, I would suggest The Sterile Cuckoo with Liza Minnelli. It's an old movie (1969) and may be hard to find.

1117637,A2VOSR1A3MLFKM,B000YABYLA,"The Captain ""Bounty628""","[2, 2]","Usually when the entire notion of teenage pregnancy is discussed the immediate reaction typically tends not to be humor. However, thanks largely in part to the release of a sensationally well done film, the trials and tribulations of teenage pregnancy and the decisions and implications associated with the ordeal have an interestingly humorous twist woven into the topic.While certainly the film is not meant to sensationalize or endorse teenage pregnancy as an issue, what writer Diablo Cote has done is taken a snapshot of one individuals plight of finding herself pregnant at age 16 to if nothing else simply cause a few chuckles within the mainstream culture. In the film Juno, Cote has written a unique and sarcastic-filled yet comedic plot that had even this skeptic laughing quite a bit throughout the film.Directed by Jason Reitman, Juno tells the story of a young high school lass who fills her day with a much more mature and cynical humor that is hard not to like. Juno McGuff (Ellen Page) is your typical high school student in just about every way: she gets picked on by the cooler kids, she hangs with her own group of friends and she finds herself falling love for a dork that she considered always to be a friend but perhaps never anything more. Paulie Bleaker (Michael Cera) is that nerdy track star friend who himself finds himself torn between whether he and Juno are truly an item.But thanks to an arm chair and some orange Tic-Tac candies, one thing led to another one crazy summer night and the next thing we know is that Juno finds herself pregnant. Though initially confronted with the realities of needing to make a wise and informed decision about what to do with the baby one way or another, a classmate helps Juno decide that giving the baby up for adoption was probably the best solution.Thanks to the local newspapers, Juno finds the picturesque couple looking to adopt a baby just as Juno was planning on having hers. Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and Mark Loring (Jason Bateman) seem to be the idyllic adoptive parents to save the baby from the cruel realities of having a sixteen year old raise the baby yet their perfection is perhaps simply mired in false realities about what their relationship truly is. Interestingly, Juno and each one of the Loring's forge a relationship together in equally separate and interesting ways.What Juno brings to the viewer is a film that is simply ripe with decent comedy and one liners that are certainly well worth expensing a few calories to muster up a laugh for. Having been somewhat removed from the entire high school scene for some time now, thankfully some pretty awesome slang terms are also thrown into the film from time to time assisting the viewer in ensuring a proper jargon is always used when encountering high school students across the globe. Though parts of the comedy certainly are a bit off base, there is nothing overly gratuitous or profane about the comedy. Thankfully this is the case because the humor is simply good enough as is and does not need the tasteless humor often too rampant in movies today.The viewer need not become ultra conservative and completely shun this film based upon the general topic at hand, either. While certainly the film is centered around a sixteen year old that became pregnant, there is not a dramatic over representation of teenage sex and the film is more a comedic drama about the post romp life of Juno.Juno is a very well written, directed and acted film that brings together all the right elements of a good film. Although even this critic went into the film a bit skeptical that it would be nothing more than a teeny bopper chick flick, in actuality the movie was pulled together quite nicely and was a more than enjoyable watch.

As of late, I've been sort of gravitating more and more toward the smaller sort of films, that tell a simple but thought-provoking story, in that vein this is about as good as they come.""Juno"" is centered around the title character, a precocious teenager who ends up getting pregnant.  As a result, she finds herself facing challenges and responsibilities well beyond her age.  She finds what appears to be the perfect couple to adopt the baby, but soon finds out they may not be as picture-perfect as she thought.  On top of that, she also must struggle with high school life, and learn to come to terms with the romantic feelings she has for her best friend, the father of her child.Overall, the story is well-written, charming, touching, and thought-provoking, with a perfect balance between comedy and drama.  And of course, I have this movie to thank for initiating what is probably a fairly inappropriate obsession with Ellen Page.  She has always been a remarkably talented actress, even from a young age (check out some of her earlier films she did in Canada), and she really brings this character to life like no one else could.  That perfect blend of acerbic wit and girl next door charm adds up to a performance that's nothing short of captivating.  Oh, and as if it weren't enough that Ms. Page is so tremendously talented and irresistably adorable, she also sings and plays guitar???  Come on, give a guy a break here!But anyway, as fantastic and scene-stealing as her performance is, the rest of the cast is great as well.  Jennifer Garner and the always-hilarious Jason Bateman are both excellent as the potential adoptive parents, Allison Janney and JK ""J. Jonah Jameson"" Simmons play minor but still very memorable roles as Juno's father and stepmother, and of course Michael Cera does the whole ""awkward but likable"" thing perfectly, as always (even if the shorts he's wearing throughout most of the movie are incredibly disturbing).  Oh, and keep your eye out for a nifty cameo from former Jurassic 5 DJ Cut Chemist as, what else?  A chemistry teacher.  And we can't forget ""The Office"" star Rainn Wilson, as the weirdo shopkeeper who speaks entirely in bizarre metaphors that barely make sense.Anyway, I'm probably pretty biased being the major Ellen Page fanboy that I am, but I highly recommend this movie.

Davis,"[1, 1]","Most people -- and obviously many Academy members -- seemed to find this movie utterly precious, yet I found it more than a bit irritating at numerous points. It continually broadcasts its cleverness in thoroughly unrealistic albeit often witty dialogue. The first 15 minutes are nearly unbearable.Fortunately, the film eventually dials back Juno's ironic pop culture references and focuses more on character. I found Ellen Page immensely appealing in the title role, and I enjoyed Juno's parents (delightfully played by Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons) as well as the couple that hopes to adopt her baby (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman), but this enjoyment was undercut by insertions like the classmate who confronts Juno at the abortion clinic, spouting bizarre lines from a bad Hal Hartley film.I never got over the forced quirkiness and self-conscious attempts at verbal wit; they brought to mind a student project. I did, however, succumb to the entertaining secondary characters and the twists and turns of the plot. I wanted to know how it would turn out, and of course things are resolved to nearly everyone's satisfaction.A good movie, but on the whole, rather overrated.

Rainn Wilson's small part as Rollo, the store clerk.3.  For a 16-year-old, Juno makes some bravely mature choices after her initial irresponsibility.4.  Juno's faded ""Slinky"" t-shirt.5.  The soundtrack.  Not bad at all.6.  The one overtly ""pro-life"" character does not seem to be Hollywood's usual dreadful caricature of a minatory fire-breathing Bible-thumper; rather, she is an endearing Asian girl with a quiet manner and a slight problem forming past participles.  It made us smile.7.  (and this point is perhaps the most important)  There is a breadth of compassion in this film for quirky societal misfits that I find quite refreshing.Any points against the film?  Juno MacGuff is, shall we say, resolutely snarky, and some might find this a bit off-putting.  (I didn't find her off-putting in the least!)  The dialogue -- which I thought was hilarious -- can be lost on viewers of a different generation (I can picture some of my older relatives saying, ""Thundercats are go?  What does that mean?  Something's going over my head."").  I had been warned by one viewer that this film did not live up to his expectations, or to the ""hype.""

1117644,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000YABYLA,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 5]","""All I notice is those `pork swords'""Juno (Ellen Page) walks around taking swigs from the largest bottle of Sunny Delite you will ever see. She hurries into a convenience store and purchases a pregnancy test from the clerk (Rainn Wilson, TV's ""The Office""). Her fears are realized. She is pregnant after having sex for the first time with Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera, ""Superbad"", TV's ""Arrested Development""). She tells her father Mac McGuff (J.K. Simmons) and step-mom Bree (Allison Janney) and decides she wants to have the baby, but give it up for adoption. Enter the perfect couple, who are unable to conceive, Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner, Justin Bateman). As the pregnancy progresses, Juno has trouble with her feelings for Paulie and the perfect couple have problems of their own.I know. From the description I just relayed, ""Juno"" sounds like an afternoon special, a precautionary tale, a drama. It couldn't be any more different than that. Director Jason Reitman (""Thank You for Smoking"") takes a screenplay by first time writer Diablo Cody, a former exotic dancer, and creates one of the funniest films I have seen this year. Much like the equally funny ""Lars and the Real Girl"", both films take characters who are off center, but believable, and allow us to watch as they use humor to deal with difficult situations.""Juno"" works so well because Juno is so believable. She seems like your average rebellious teenager. Ready and willing to act out, albeit mildly, she is just a teen girl trying to figure things out. So when she is in a band with Paulie, and there seems to be an attraction, he might be the right guy to try sex with for the first time. He is also attracted to her, so he agrees. They are testing out sex together. As Juno relates these events, she provides us with amusing insights, noticing Paulie's addiction to Orange TicTacs for instance. Also, Paulie is on the Junior High running team, so she seems to notice eight or nine of his team mates running by her, wearing their short gold running shorts, their ""pork swords"" moving underneath, at all times. This is a constant running joke, no pun intended, because Paulie's teammates always seem to be running by Juno whenever she is outside, emphasizing the fact she is noticing boys for the first time in her life.JK Simmons and Allison Janney are also very good as her parents. As each is introduced to us by Juno, she also provides amusing antidotes for them as well. For instance, we learn her step-mom Bree (Janney) runs a manicure salon, so Bree, like all people who are preoccupied with the one thing they are good at, talks about nails, and manicures, and everything related to it, sneaking in these references as much as possible. When she takes Juno to see a doctor, and the doctor prescribes a particular vitamin, Bree quickly notes how this helps to make nails stronger. Their reaction to Juno's news about the pregnancy is also very funny.Michael Cera is very good as Paulie, a smart kid, member of the track team and a kid who seems genuinely interested in Juno as a girlfriend, but also as a friend. They really seem to get along together and Paulie is attracted to her. Because he is so sweet, and good-natured, he is also extremely likable. His mother, who clearly doesn't like Juno, puts up with her because she knows her son is attracted to her. He usually makes good decisions, so she gives him the benefit of the doubt. But she isn't beyond giving Juno a dead stare any time she comes to the house. But Juno knows this will happen and simply ignores her until she retreats to Paulie's sanctuary, his bedroom. There, she feels safe.When the two get together, they look at each other, regarding each other with interest, yet unsure how to express this. There is hunger in their eyes, but they haven't had enough experience to know this is a natural thing. Yet.Michael Cera makes Paulie interesting because he is clearly going through the same problems all teenage males go through, yet he doesn't quite seem to have the angst we are used to seeing in film characters.Mac accompanies his daughter to their first meeting with Vanessa and Mark, to make sure they don't take advantage of his daughter. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman play the perfect couple. Vanessa feels she was born to be a mother and is kind of desperate to have a baby. Mark seems less gung-ho, but is willing to go along because it is what his wife wants.Vanessa is also a bit weary because they have tried to adopt before only to have the birth mother back out at the last minute. The desperation is very clear, something she is unable to hide with her wide smile. Mark tries to help her deal, but he also seems a bit ambivalent about the whole thing. Or maybe he is just tired.As the pregnancy progresses, Juno decides to drop by and keep the adoptive couple up to date. As she sees more of them, she learns more about them and realizes there are some cracks in the perfect faade. On one of these visits, Juno finds Mark at home alone and learns about some of his hobbies; they have an argument about horror films and Mark shows her one of his favorites. But he is quick to try to rush her out of the house when Vanessa returns home from work.What makes Mark and Vanessa so interesting is a level of unease hinted at throughout their relationship. Mark is concerned about Vanessa finding Juno in their house. Vanessa is desperate to have a child, because they can't seem to conceive. There are other moments which subtly reveal things about Mark and Vanessa, showing that perhaps they aren't as perfect as they seem.Director Jason Reitman, son of Ivan, director of ""Ghostbusters"", ""Dave"" and many other memorable comedy blockbusters, seems to have a career in his own right. His debut feature ""Thank You for Smoking"" was a dark comedy based on the book by Christopher Buckley. A very funny look at the lobbying industry, starring Aaron Eckhart and Catherine Keener, among others, ""Smoking"" was easily one of the best of that year. Now, Reitman follows with ""Juno"". Both films share an oddball sense of humor, a skewed way of looking at the universe which helps to make the films and stories more interesting. Reitman isn't afraid to let his characters say what they should, nee what they need to, whether it is PC or not. Because of this, his characters seem more real, even though they are incredibly well-spoken and well-versed.In ""Juno"", Reitman seems to have found his muse in Ellen Page. As Juno, Page narrates the film providing many insights, acting as the voice for the director and writer. Because she is a teenage girl, her voice is deadpan and frequently conveys she could care less about what she is experiencing. This fits perfectly for her character; a teenager would share these same feelings. Frequently, as she makes an observation, trying to act disdainful of the feeling, she secretly betrays herself and reveals she is excited or afraid or unsure, even if just a little.Reitman and his cast deserve a lot of the credit for making this film work. But the first time screenwriter, Diablo Cody, has also done a remarkable job. From what I understand, Cody, a former exotic dancer of some sort, decided she wanted to become a screenwriter and came up with ""Juno"", her first screenplay, which was produced virtually unchanged. She provides these characters with unusual, interesting voices, making the film very funny.Her observations of characters, especially Bree and the Lorings, help to make the film come alive. With these casual asides, we actually learn a lot about the people and what makes them tick. None of them are completely bad; none of them are completely good either.Also, just when it seems like Cody could take the obvious route, making fun of Vanessa and Mark, or Juno's parents, the screenwriter leads us to suspect this is about to happen only to change course and make us laugh at something unexpected. That takes talent.""Juno"" is a very good film, one of the year's best comedies. Filled with interesting, off-center characters dealing with difficult situations in the way they know best; with humor.",5,4 1/2 - Surprisingly good,1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,8121,"['notice',

This is just one of the many, many original, hilarious lines in this poignant comedy that sidesteps just about every clique and forges ahead to become one of the most original pieces of work to come out in a long time!The plot may seem simple, but do not let it mislead you. Juno (played brilliantly by Ellen Page) is a sixteen year-old girl who gets pregnant with her boyfriend Paulie (played by Michael Cera) and decides to give it to a couple (Mark and Vanessa Loring, played by Jason Bateman and Jenifer Garner) looking for a baby to adopt. The film covers all Four Seasons, and Juno's entire pregnancy.What makes Juno so different from all the other teen comedies is the combination of Diablo Cody's script and Ellen Page's exciting, energetic performance as the heroin. Most essentially though is the script with such sharp, clever, non-stop dialogue, that I found myself anticipating the lines whenever a character opened their mouth to speak.As I mentioned Ellen Page's performance is what makes this film work so well, but she is greatly aided by one of the best supporting casts I have seen in a while. This includes: Jenifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Michael Cera, Allison Janney, J.K. Simmons, and Olivia Thirlby. Everyone one does so well together on screen and stays in their appropriate amount so the story is never overcrowded.This is a sweet, funny, enjoyable film filled with a delightful humanity.",5,"""You should've gone to China, you know, 'cause I hear they give away babies like free iPods.""",1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,1507,"['should', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'China', 'know', ""'cause"", 'hear', 'give', 'away', 'babies', 'free', 'iPods', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'many', 'original', 'hilarious', 'lines', 'poignant', 'comedy', 'just', 'about', 'clique', 'forges', 'ahead', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'pieces', 'work', 'come', 'out', 'long', 'time', 'plot', 'may', 'seem', 'simple', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'mislead', 'Juno', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'sixteen', 'year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'pregnant', 'boyfriend', 'Paulie', 'played', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'give', 'couple', 'Mark', 'Vanessa', 'Loring', 'played', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Jenifer', 'Garner', 'looking', 'baby', 'adopt', 'film', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'Juno', 'entire', 'pregnancy.What', 'Juno', 'so', 'different', 'other', 'teen', 'comedies', 'combination', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'script', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'exciting', 'energetic', 'performance', 'heroin', 'Most', 'essentially', 'script', 'such', 'sharp', 'clever', 'non-stop', 'dialogue', 'found', 'anticipating', 'lines', 'whenever', 'character', 'opened', 'mouth', 'speak.As', 'mentioned', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'performance', 'what', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'greatly', 'aided', 'one', 'best', 'supporting', 'casts', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'Jenifer', 'Garner', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'Everyone', 'one', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'screen', 'stays', 'appropriate', 'amount', 'so', 'story', 'never', 'overcrowded.This', 'sweet', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'filled', 'delightful', 'humanity']",Juno

I can't believe this film was up for four Oscars (including Best Picture?!?!? must've been an off-year), and won for Best Original Screenplay.  I don't know any teenagers that talk like this.  But what completely did in the film for me was the parents' completely unrealistic reaction to their daughter breaking the news of her pregnancy to them.  THey were pretty much cool with the whole thing, with dry, witty comments - no raised voices?!?!  I've known people in this situation, where parents and family members FLIPPED OUT completely when they got the news, almost without exception.  I saw virtually no evidence that the family was SO tight they'd be ok with something like this.  There was virtually no conflict in much of this movie.  The subject of teen pregnancy, for the most part, is treated as a minor speedbump in the high school experience.  Almost NO complications, not a whole lot of complaints about physical ailments/changes/etc that come with pregnancy?!?! (oh, right, she pees a lot).  Almost no one, from the kids to the adults, seems to get the gravity of the situation (not one word about it jeopardizing college/futures?), at least not in convincing fashion, till the baby is crowning.  Some of the acting is good, but i think it's the writing that's thin here (in addition to the completely subpar, hipper-than-thou, off-key soundtrack full of some of the worst indie-rock i've ever heard, and endless hipster references).  they must've ate this up at Sundance.  Jason Reitman is a very promising and capable young director who did much better work with much better material in ""THank You for Smoking"", IMO.

The strategy of such movies is to give the characters a few quirks but make sure they all have hearts of gold. Juno is full of witty quips (improbable for most 16 year old's) and her boyfriend Bleeker loves tic-tacs (that's about all we found out about him throughout the entire movie).Juno's parents blandly accept her pregnancy and they have nothing much to do except wheel her into the maternity ward when she's about to give birth (funny how the father disappears for most of the movie--he's nothing more than a kind-hearted cheerleader for his daughter when we do get to see him).The screenwriter, Diablo Cody, takes a stab at creating an antagonist in the character of Mark Loring, who decides to divorce his wife and foil Juno's plans of having the couple adopt her baby. But even though he decides to leave, he's also still a good guy--albeit a person who simply needs to ""find himself"".Ultimately ""Juno"" doesn't have enough conflict to keep one's attention for a full hour and a half. Cody falls back on predictable, saccharine moments to fill the void. Did I forget to mention Jennifer Garner? Her 'Vanessa' is probably the dullest of all the characters in the movie.Many on this board who gave the film a low rating fault it for trivializing teen pregnancy.

Ellen Page plays the title heroine with all the spunk and cynicism of an underage Janeane Garofalo in her nine month journey from copulation to parturition, as she struggles with her ever-expanding belly and the added pressure of turning her child over to an adoptive couple.Sometimes vulgar and always sassy, Juno may stretch the limits of believability with her quick wit at times.  Like male characters from Kevin Smith films, she's just a tad bit too quick and too smart.  A lot of her snarky comments get delivered with such speed that she's already snapped another off before the first makes sense.But as the film progresses, her ""f-you"" attitude to the world is revealed to be a faade hiding someone more tender and idealistic.  Roger Ebert says she's a character he wants to hug.  Although most audiences would agree, Juno herself would probably be quick to point out that Rog is a little old to be hugging underage girls.Like the previously released ""Knocked Up"", a heart exists at the center of Juno that makes the tale irresistible.  Of course, the film has its share of ""bad guys"", but the bulk of the story is about people trying to do what's right and who want to make the best of their time on earth.  It's easy to care about the people in Juno, to feel happiness when they're happy, and to hurt when they hurt.SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD: My biggest complaint with the film is it's reluctance to embrace what seemed like should have been the logical conclusion.  The film establishes a choice Juno must make: either to keep her child or turn it over to a wealthy, childless couple played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner.  The couple live in the suburbs, own nice cars, wear sweaters and drink expensive wine.  But Hollywood is not ready to make a film that praises the virtues of a two-parent household over that of a single mother, so something must happen to prevent that ending.  The people behind this film couldn't have their audiences leaving the theater thinking the movie promoted traditional views of the ideal home from a child, so they throw together a very reaching and questionable ending where a single-mother household is shown to be the best solution to the problem of a child born to a single mother.  Huh?  Exactly.  Again, Hollywood shows its political leanings.  Unlike a much brave film (Gone Baby Gone), Juno lost an opportunity to deal with the realities of what is/isn't the best environment for a child, and instead opts for a save conclusion that won't offend any feminists groups.  Too bad.",4,"""Yeah, I'm a legend.

She is a breath of fresh air, almost single handedly carrying this film from start to finish, appearing in almost every scene.  She plays Juno, a high school misfit who comes from your ""average"" dysfunctional family -- mom left when she was young, father remarries and has another daughter.  Juno and Paul (Michael Cera) have sex and she gets pregnant.  At first she contemplates abortion, but instead decides to give the baby up for adoption.  She finds a yuppie couple, played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, looking to adopt since the wife is unable to have a child.  Both Garner and Bateman gives strong supporting performances.Sure, the plot doesn't sound like much, but the plot isn't what makes this movie special.  The screenplay and writing are superb and Page is a revelation.  At times, I was worried that the movie would turn sentimental but it never does.  And alternatively, the movie never gets too full or smart for itself -- coming close but never quite crossing the line.

1117660,A1DORQXHAAR8J9,B000YABYLA,"William H. Kelsey ""seeker of truth""","[15, 25]","This wasn't even the best pregnancy film of 2007 (that would be the hilarious ""Knocked Up"", which was 10 billion times smarter, funnier, and better performed and written than ""Juno"". If you haven't seen it by now, run out and rent or buy tout de suite!). In fact, if this film had not been written by a former stripper (Ms. Cody, whose story the media loved), I doubt that it would had made it beyond Sundance. I simply don't understand why everyone loved it so. I had heard just how witty and mature a teen Juno had been written; perhaps I had seen a different film, but to me she simply came acrossed as a snotty little brat. Making jokes about drinking and birth defects with the prospective adoptive parents of your child is neither witty nor clever; it is disgusting and immature. Intelligent, witty teens have appeared before; ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Say Anything"", in more recent years, ""My So Called Life"" and ""Felicity"". These writers knew how to make teens sound mature yet vulnerable; realistic yet insightful. Cody does not. I knew I was in trouble 5 minutes into the film with the exchange between Juno and the beyond weird clerk, but I was hoping against hope that he was simply a quirky character. Alas, he was not. Every character here (save for Ms. Garner's, which is the only well written and evolved role and ultimately the only one you'll root for) is written to be as odd as possible. I know that this film was aiming to be the next ""American Beauty"" with its off beat cast and dialogue (not to mention that Ms. Page could pass as Thora Birch's sister), but it doesn't come close to that film's greatness and simply is a shallow attempt. How unrealistic is it? When the parents are told that their 16 year old daughter is pregnant, they react far less than my parents when I had brought home a puppy without their premission. The father of the baby never has or seems to desire a say in the future of his unborn child (not to mention his parents. If my child fathered a baby, I would want to raise it rather than to have it go to strangers and never to see it again). Juno (who, contrary to the poorly researched film, was named after JUPITER'S wife, not ZEUS'S) is obsessed with the 70's and punk music; which is strange since she plays acoustic guitar not punk noise. After the baby is born, there is no emotional crisis, even though Juno herself makes a point of telling us how much it hurt when her mother left her to start a new life. Does she not realise that she had done the same? There are simply no really consequences in this film. In real life, having a baby while in high school (even if one does give him/her up for adoption) comes with the risk of being overlooked by colleges, massive physical and emotional upheavels (just dealing with regular teen hormones is difficult enough; imagine throwing pregnant hormones on top of that), a postpartum body that never looks or acts the same as the before version, etc. Nevermind that the boyfriend never has to take responsibility for anything. If my daughter became pregnant while in high school, the very first phone call would be to the boy and his parents. Basically, Juno treates her unborn child like one would an unruly puppy: just give it away to someone with more time and space in their lives. While antiabortion people might love the fact that she carried to term, I don't think this film gives either a positive message, cautionary advice, or much in the way of laughs (besides Juno's comment about how Sonic Youth just sounds like noise. I completely relate). This film wins the bronze medal for pregnancy films of 2007, with ""Knocked Up"" being gold and ""Waitress"" coming in silver. Watch those if you really want to laugh at pregnancy mishaps.",2,The Best Film of 2007?

Her first thought is to end the pregnancy but, when the time comes, she shies and bolts from the clinic for no rational reason. Instead, she decides to bring the baby to term and find a good home for it.Even when she's as big as ""a planet"" (and equally inhabited), Juno keeps her sassy attitude and sarcastic humor. Her character, played wonderfully well by Ellen Page, carries the movie with her one-liners and attitude. Like the other characters, Juno comes across as complex and believable, fragile and resilient at the same time. Her social world seems true too, almost a closed society of teenagers with incidental and often uncomfortable interactions with the adults.This might be the most improbable feel-good movie ever. In fact that would be the one criticism I'd offer, that it seems a bit more ""cleaned up"" than I'd expect many lives to be. The teenagers are goofy, gawky, and uncertain, but never show the vicious edge that comes out way too frequently. Her whole world is largely supportive, or at least benign. I don't wish a pregnancy on any teenager, but I'd wish that kind of support for any who do end up as mommy-to-be, the kind of support that too few girls in trouble seem to get.

But, just the same, this movie is important.Why?Because it got a lot of people talking.  A lot of people stand against this movie because of it's subject matter; teen pregnancy.  While Juno's initial reaction to have an abortion further shocked many people, these were the confused actions of a young woman who, after realizing that she cannot go through with an abortion, goes through the rest of the movie making the best possible decisions from the baby's perspective.A lot of people think this movie promotes teen pregnancy. This is due, in part, by a number of teen girls who've seen and responded to the film. Others feel (wrongly) that it promotes abortion.  But the movie makes no clear stance on abortion (much like we, as a whole, have not) and teen girls are always going to say stupid things.  They're teens for crying out loud.This film is a snippet of real life.  Teens really do get pregnant because a late teen's body is the best suited for the job of procreation. The hormones drive them to it.  They (teens) have been doing it sicne the very first humans andit was not until recent (very recent) times that our culture decreed that the teenage years are a part of childhood, and that teen should not be having sex.  Yet, at the same time, we live in a culture that places sex into every aspect of life.  The highest grossing models are underage girls... Kids have sex.  Culturally, we encourage it while at the same time telling them not to.  Getting pregnant is a risk, but why is it that we only blame the youths who get pregnant?  Because I can assure you that most all of them are having sex.Juno is important because it's an honest LOOK (not praise, not judgement) on an issue that happens, regardless of preceeding morals.  What's more, being under forty, I found this is one of the few films that accurately depicted adolesence as I lived it.  The characters and the language were familiar to me.What I like about Juno is that it is showing a difficult thing but at the same time the audience can, and will, both critisize and sympathize with the character of Juno, who errs and then decides to do the right thing, despite the obvious difficulties and she does it all with the help of a loving, supportive family.
