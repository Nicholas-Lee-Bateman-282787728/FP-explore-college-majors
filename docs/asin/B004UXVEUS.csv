1429724,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004UXVEUS,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[9, 10]","Boos and hisses on Amazon for not having the show's catchy title track (Power's ""Can You Save Me"") available as an MP3 download. And that may (or may not) be the only negative thing I say here, because COVERT AFFAIRS, one of USA Network's entries in the sub-genre of spy thriller lite, is must-see television in my household. Piper Perabo continues to be compelling as the CIA's latest recruit Annie Walker. As we learned in Season One's first episode, her director has no qualms in immediately plunging her in deep waters, one field assignment chased by another. I am madly in crush with Piper Perabo, and I figure her unusual and catchy name has something to do with it. But there's also that slightly offbeat vibe she's got going on. And I've said this elsewhere, but, man, her face is so expressive and she exudes smarts.I dunno if this is fact or fiction, but it's established early in the show that the CIA's hiring freeze unfroze after 9/11, which has resulted in 50% of the agency now flaunting a mere 5 years of experience or less. Factor in that Annie placed tops in her spy training class, and maybe the director's decision to deploy Annie so soon is easier to comprehend. In Season 2 Chris Gorham demonstrates that he still flexes those ridiculous abs. Peter Gallagher still parades around with those two pet caterpillars he insists are eyebrows. Season 2 still has me singing along to the catchy theme song. And Season 2 finds Annie Walker less broken-hearted and more the seasoned spy, although she hasn't all the way shed her wide-eyed innocence; she's yet to develop that guarded, cynical shell. But her instincts have been on point from jump. She keeps getting the job done (well, mostly), even if she sometimes steps outside of proper agency protocol. Some may frown at her insubordination. But others may flip that around and call it ""showing initiative"" and ""adapting to adverse situations.""We see what happens to her recently turned-up mystery man, that ex-boyfriend for whom she annoyingly pined for most of last season. That's not to say that her other admirers don't get spotlighted. In ""Good Advices"" Annie and Mossad agent Eyal Lavin (Oded Fehr, awesome) run into each other and butt heads over a prospective asset, and in ""A Girl Like You"" Lavin returns to Washington, D.C. on an unsanctioned (and personal) mission. And there are other dudes sniffing around.Okay, the writing could be sharper, and, honestly, I'm not that into the shady internal politics that go on within the CIA. But the appealing cast and the breezy, upbeat tone help make the show very easy to swallow. Piper Perabo is never less than captivating. She anchors the show effortlessly. I hope this is her breakout role and that she gets more pub out of this, because I think she's talented and deserving. Meanwhile, I'm crossing my fingers for something to develop even more between Annie and her trusted pal Auggie (Chris Gorham). Perabo and Gorham together create serious sparks, but it's probably best that whatever it is they've got going on, it unfolds at a slow burn. By the way, Gorham's blind CIA tech wrangler just may be the best character in the show. Maybe my favorite Season 2 episodes is ""Half a World Away,"" in which Auggie's jazz festival jaunt in Istanbul inadvertently turns into an espionage mission. In this ep, it's revealed how Auggie lost his eyesight.And, as always, we note the dichotomy between Annie's CIA capers and her sometimes frazzled domestic life with her sister. Season 1 ended with Danielle (Anne Dudek) still believing Annie's Smithsonian cover. In Season 2, cue certain developments.COVERT AFFAIRS isn't as nerve-jangling or action-packed as 24, isn't as plot-twisty as ALIAS, and our heroine doesn't boast the experience and jadedness of Michael Westen on BURN NOTICE. It tends to be episodic in nature, which results in our not caring that much about the caper of the week. But COVERT AFFAIRS finds a nice balance in showcasing the more glamorous, globe-trotting, adventurous side of Annie's missions with those other assignments in which she deals with the more mundane aspects of the job. I think of all the things that COVERT AFFAIRS isn't, and I'm even more amazed that this show steadily hooks in its share of the Nielsen pie. Piper Perabo is pitch perfect. And it's always neat to discover what other language Annie Walker has mastered. Just as with BONES and with CASTLE, it's not so much the cases as it is the interactions among the cast members that draw us in. And, finally, it's good to see Auggie's close combat sessions with Annie paying off huge. The Season 3 opener is just around the corner, on July 10th. I may fidget anxiously until then.The COVERT AFFAIRS Season 2 set consists of all 16 episodes on four discs and the following special features: several deleted scenes, a gag reel, Piper's introduction of the series at Comic-Con 2011, and a behind-the-scenes featurette entitled ""Covert Affairs On Location.""",4,boil it down to Perabo and Gorham and their lightning-in-a-bottle

It's about the characters!  This Auggie-centric episode finally answers the question of: How did he become blind?  It really is a heart wrenching story.  You see the character in a light that you really only got to glimpse at before.  His friendship with Annie is put to the test and at the end of the episode you really get a sense of how close these two have become.  Whether the writers put them together in a romantic sense or not...it's one of the best relationships out there.  The final scene with Auggie and Annie at Allen's Tavern is enough to make even the most hardened person cry.  The use of Gaslight Anthem's ""We Did It When We Were Young"" is inspired.  One of the best episodes yet.I absolutely love this show and have a growing respect for USA and their development team.

Piper Perabo is simply a pleasure to watch in this role, from start to finish.  She pretty much had me twisted around her little pinky a few episodes in when I realized that she had the power to go from funny to heartbreaking in a few moments.  I've really enjoyed Christopher Gorham since ""Jake 2.0"", and seeing him here is not unlike seeing him in that role again--a computer wise spy guy.  The trick here is that he is blind, but every bit as deadly and capable as his sighted companions.  The evolving relationship between Perabo and Gorham on screen kept me coming back in season 1, and in season 2 it just gets better.  Annie and Auggie make perfect friends and foils, their banter and friendship are the secret to what makes this show great.  The moment in episode 7 when we learn more about Auggie's blindness...well, I'll leave you hopefully wondering.  Jump on the Covert Affairs train.
