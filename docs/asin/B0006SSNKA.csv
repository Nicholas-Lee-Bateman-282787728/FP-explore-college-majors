873002,A2QL4RD93Z4KYP,B0006SSNKA,Becca,"[9, 9]","I was only a year old when Punky Brewster first aired on NBC.  I am now 21 and have been waiting for this show to be on DVD since it went off the air as reruns when i was in the 4th grade...about 1994.  I think Punky was my idol.  I loved everything about her and the fact that I looked like her.  Its so great to watch all these episodes now, because its hard to even remember them.  I remember the characters and some stories, but not well enough. I get so excited to come home after going to school (college!) LOL and watch a few Punky episodes. Its funny how much things change.  I loved all the episodes, but ""Perils of Punky"", the 2 part episodes were so strange!  I don't know if little kids were enjoy it, but its Punky so its ok.  I just wasn't thrilled with those episodes.I also loved that there were stickers!!!!!  I hope that they continue putting out the rest of the episodes of Punky.  As someone else has mentioned, the cartoons are a great bonus!  I loved the saturday morning cartoon and we wouldn't be able to have them w/out these DVD's.  I also hope that the next DVD set has an interview w/Soleil because that would make the set complete.  I think its only fitting that she talk about the show that launched her career.If you're looking for something to remind you of your childhood in the 80's...this is it!  My boss's daughter (and my friend) is 10 years old and I have her hooked on Punky.  Her mom watched it as a teenager, and likes that I have been buying them and sharing them with her.  I love to see that kids now days are able to see something WORTH watching.  Shows today just aren't what the 80's and early 90's were.",5,Punky Power!,1107993600,"02 10, 2005",2005,1651,"['was', 'only', 'year', 'old', 'when', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'first', 'aired', 'NBC', 'am', 'now', '21', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'show', 'be', 'DVD', 'went', 'air', 'reruns', 'when', 'i', 'was', '4th', 'grade', '1994', 'think', 'Punky', 'was', 'idol', 'loved', 'everything', 'fact', 'looked', 'so', 'great', 'watch', 'episodes', 'now', 'hard', 'even', 'remember', 'remember', 'characters', 'stories', 'not', 'well', 'enough', 'get', 'so', 'excited', 'come', 'home', 'going', 'school', 'college', 'LOL', 'watch', 'few', 'Punky', 'episodes', 'funny', 'how', 'much', 'things', 'change', 'loved', 'episodes', 'Perils', 'Punky', '2', 'part', 'episodes', 'were', 'so', 'strange', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'little', 'kids', 'were', 'enjoy', 'Punky', 'ok', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'episodes.I', 'also', 'loved', 'were', 'stickers', 'hope', 'continue', 'putting', 'out', 'rest', 'episodes', 'Punky', 'someone', 'else', 'mentioned', 'cartoons', 'are', 'great', 'bonus', 'loved', 'saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'have', 'DVD', 'also', 'hope', 'next', 'DVD', 'set', 'interview', 'w/Soleil', 'would', 'make', 'set', 'complete', 'think', 'only', 'fitting', 'talk', 'show', 'launched', 'career.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'remind', 'childhood', '80', 'My', 'boss', 'daughter', 'friend', '10', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'hooked', 'Punky', 'mom', 'watched', 'teenager', 'have', 'been', 'buying', 'sharing', 'love', 'see', 'kids', 'now', 'days', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'something', 'WORTH', 'watching', 'today', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', '80', 'early', '90', 'were']",Punky Brewster - Season Two

873005,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B0006SSNKA,Dorrie Wheeler,"[28, 29]","The second season of Punky Brewster will be in stores on February 8th, 2005. This is awesome news for fans of the series who were treated with the first season of Punky Brewster on DVD less than a year ago. The second season includes 22 episodes from the 1985-1986 season. If you are from the 80's you surely remember and love Punky Brewster. Soleil Moon Frye starred in this series as a loveable orphan who found a new home with an older man named Henry. Punky attended school and had daily adventures with her friends Cherie, Margeaux, Allen and her dog Brandon.The episodes of the second season are a bit different than season 1. You can tell instantly that the writers tweaked the show a bit. Henry is now much more warm to Punky and her friends, whereas during season 1 Henry was much more grumpy and sometimes mean. The goofy, nerdy building super doesn't make frequent appearances. Season 1 was primarily about Punky and her accepting that she is an orphan and developing her relationship with Henry. Season 2 is for the most part about Punky and her friends.Punky is now in the fourth grade and her teacher Mike Fulton (formerly Mike from Fenster Hall), plays a large part in Punky's life. Mike is a mentor and a friend. In the episode, ""Just Say No,"" when Punky and Cherie are influenced to use drugs by an ultra cool girl group named The Chicklits, Mike helps Punky and Cherie organize their own group of kids who Just Say No. In the episode, ""The Search,"" Punky and Mike embark on a search to find their mothers. In a very bittersweet episode, Mike and his mother are reunited and Punky still doesn't find her own mom. Mike was in so many season 2 episodes he should have been included in some of the season 2 artwork for the DVD.Cherie emerges as Punky's clear best friend and they continue to share adventures. Punky, Cherie, Margeaux and Allen share a wild adventure in a crazy two part episode titled ""The Perils of Punky."" This two part episode is part The Goonies and part Neverending Story. Kids will find this episode amusing.The DVD PackagingThe DVD packaging is quite similar to season 1. The cover art is the same, except this set is orange. The episode names are written on the inside box flap. Each individual disc lies in their own space and are easy to remove.The ExtrasPunky Brewster stickers! Each set includes on sheet of color Punky Brewster stickers. The best thing about Punky Brewster on DVD is the fact that you get episodes of the cartoon series It's Punky Brewster. Shout Factory has included over 3 hours of the cartoon series on this box set. I think it is great that you get the episodes of the cartoon because this is a cartoon series that probably wouldn't have been released on DVD otherwise. Soleil Moon Frye still doesn't appear in an updated interview or episode commentary, but actor George Gaynes appears in a sit down interview.If you enjoyed Punky Brewster as a child or teen in the 80's, chances are that you are now in your mid-late twenties or thirties. Watching these episodes as an adult, you might think to yourself, ""This is kind of silly I can't believe I used to watch this show."" However, it is important to remember that Punky Brewster was a show written for kids. If you have kids of your own or nieces or nephews I guarantee that kids today will enjoy this show. My kids love Punky Brewster. Watching Punky is the ultimate treat for them and they laugh out loud at her hijinx.",5,Punky & Her Friends and Lot's of Extras,1106956800,"01 29, 2005",2005,3438,"['second', 'season', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'will', 'be', 'stores', 'February', '8th', '2005', 'awesome', 'news', 'fans', 'series', 'who', 'were', 'treated', 'first', 'season', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'DVD', 'less', 'year', 'ago', 'second', 'season', '22', 'episodes', '1985-1986', 'season', 'are', '80', 'surely', 'remember', 'love', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'Soleil', 'Moon', 'Frye', 'starred', 'series', 'loveable', 'orphan', 'who', 'found', 'new', 'home', 'older', 'man', 'named', 'Henry', 'Punky', 'attended', 'school', 'had', 'daily', 'adventures', 'friends', 'Cherie', 'Margeaux', 'Allen', 'dog', 'Brandon.The', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'are', 'bit', 'different', 'season', '1', 'can', 'tell', 'instantly', 'writers', 'tweaked', 'show', 'bit', 'Henry', 'now', 'much', 'more', 'warm', 'Punky', 'friends', 'whereas', 'season', '1', 'Henry', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'grumpy', 'sometimes', 'mean', 'goofy', 'nerdy', 'building', 'super', ""n't"", 'make', 'frequent', 'appearances', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'primarily', 'Punky', 'accepting', 'orphan', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Henry', 'Season', '2', 'most', 'part', 'Punky', 'friends.Punky', 'now', 'fourth', 'grade', 'teacher', 'Mike', 'Fulton', 'formerly', 'Mike', 'Fenster', 'Hall', 'large', 'part', 'Punky', 'life', 'Mike', 'mentor', 'friend', 'episode', 'Just', 'Say', 'No', 'when', 'Punky', 'Cherie', 'are', 'influenced', 'use', 'drugs', 'ultra', 'cool', 'girl', 'group', 'named', 'Chicklits', 'Mike', 'Punky', 'Cherie', 'organize', 'own', 'group', 'kids', 'who', 'Just', 'Say', 'No', 'episode', 'Search', 'Punky', 'Mike', 'embark', 'search', 'find', 'mothers', 'very', 'bittersweet', 'episode', 'Mike', 'mother', 'are', 'reunited', 'Punky', 'still', ""n't"", 'find', 'own', 'mom', 'Mike', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'season', '2', 'episodes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'season', '2', 'artwork', 'DVD.Cherie', 'Punky', 'clear', 'best', 'friend', 'continue', 'share', 'adventures', 'Punky', 'Cherie', 'Margeaux', 'Allen', 'share', 'wild', 'adventure', 'crazy', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'titled', 'Perils', 'Punky', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'part', 'Goonies', 'part', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'Kids', 'will', 'find', 'episode', 'DVD', 'PackagingThe', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'quite', 'similar', 'season', '1', 'cover', 'art', 'same', 'set', 'orange', 'episode', 'names', 'are', 'written', 'inside', 'box', 'flap', 'individual', 'disc', 'lies', 'own', 'space', 'are', 'easy', 'remove.The', 'ExtrasPunky', 'Brewster', 'stickers', 'set', 'sheet', 'color', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'stickers', 'best', 'thing', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'DVD', 'fact', 'get', 'episodes', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'included', '3', 'hours', 'cartoon', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'think', 'great', 'get', 'episodes', 'cartoon', 'cartoon', 'series', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'otherwise', 'Soleil', 'Moon', 'Frye', 'still', ""n't"", 'appear', 'updated', 'interview', 'episode', 'commentary', 'actor', 'George', 'Gaynes', 'sit', 'down', 'interview.If', 'enjoyed', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'child', 'teen', '80', 'chances', 'are', 'are', 'now', 'mid-late', 'twenties', 'thirties', 'Watching', 'episodes', 'adult', 'might', 'think', 'kind', 'silly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'used', 'watch', 'show', 'However', 'important', 'remember', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'was', 'show', 'written', 'kids', 'have', 'kids', 'own', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'guarantee', 'kids', 'today', 'will', 'enjoy', 'show', 'kids', 'love', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'Watching', 'Punky', 'ultimate', 'treat', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'hijinx']",Punky Brewster - Season Two

873012,A14A4YYKPLYY26,B0006SSNKA,LactivistAnti-VaccineLiberal,"[13, 15]","The Punky Brewster saga continues with this fabulous set of Season 2!Punky Brewster ROCKS!!This 4 disc set contains all 22 episodes of the 1985-86 season, and 3 hours of the popular Saturday morning animated show It's Punky Brewster, as well as an interview with Helsinki-born actor George Gaynes, who played Henry Warnimont, Punky's foster (and later adoptive) father. An extra special feature of this Season 2 set is a sheet of free Punky Power stickers included in every box. I LOVE Punky Brewster! I've got Punky Power!!In Season 2, Punky and the gang are back, and a year older. Punky and her friends are now 9 and in the fourth grade with Mr. Mike Fulton, who was introduced at the end of Season 1 as a worker at Fenster Hall, the emergency children's shelter. Now Mike has gotten a job as a teacher, and Punky, Cherie, Allen and Margaux are all in his fourth grade class.One of the differences between Season 1 and Season 2 is the absence of Eddie, the goofy, and geeky apartment building's maintenance man. Although, I can understand his removal, as this season is primarily about Punky, and the developing relationship with Henry and her friends, I still kind of missed Eddie in the second season. To me, he injected a different kind of humor into the show, with his constant mishaps, and his run-ins with Henry and his wisecracks. Oh well. The show is still terrific anyway. I just kind of missed those scenes, that's all.Season 2 also deals more with serious issues than they did in Season 1, which though had some heavy episodes (Fenster Hall, I Love You, Brandon, etc.) they weren't as many. In Season 2 there are episodes that deal with drugs and peer pressure (Just Say No), parental kidnapping in custody disputes (Milk Does a Body Good), the consequences of stealing (Christmas Shoplifting) facing one's fears (Urban Fear) gender discrimination (Girls Will Be Boys), compassion for others (The Gift) and more!But though this season deals with several serious issues, they are presented in such a way that it is suitable for all ages to see. Also, like Season 1, there is no graphic violence, or other inappropriate material.However, there is one 2 Part episode (The Perils of Punky) in which Punky and her friends find themselves lost in the woods during a camping trip, ending up in a vacant Indian cave, where Punky tells a ghost story that becomes the basis of the episode, which younger children (even some sensitive adults alone at night! LOL!) might find scary.But other than that ONE 2-part episode, this show is still a WONDERFUL family-friendly show! Out of all the DVD's I've seen, Punky Brewster is one of my favorites! I CAN'T WAIT until all 4 seasons of this wonderful show come out on DVD! I am going to buy them all!Ever since I got this set, I have been watching it over and over! When and if I have children someday, I want them to watch this great show too! Although at the rate I am watching it now, by then, I may need to buy a whole new DVD set of this series! LOL!!Like with Season 1, I love ALL the episodes on this set, but I think my favorite episode would have to be the 5 part ""Changes"" episode, because it shows how the love between Henry and Punky has blossomed over the past two seasons, and how although they're not biologically related, these 2 have truly become like father and daughter. Best of all, this 5 episode story arc ends with Punky being officially adopted by Henry!Punky Brewster - Season Twoalso includes 16 episodes of the animated series, ""It's Punky Brewster"" cartoons, as well as an interview with George Gaynes (who played Punky's foster/adoptive father, Henry Warnimont)However, even though I LOVE this DVD set, I still DO have one complaint, and a couple of quibbles about it.First of all, my complaint (and IMHO, the biggest problem) with this set is the HORRIBLE packaging. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY HATE cardboard DVD boxes, or for that matter, ANY style of DVD cases that involves cardboard!Rather than a cardboard DVD box holding ANOTHER cardboard box that unfolds and folds up/out (the style used for THIS set, as well asPunky Brewster - Season One), I much PREFER the single plastic DVD case with an inner tray-rack to hold the discs (like the DVD case for7th Heaven - The Complete Third SeasonandLaw & Order: The Ninth Yearamong others!) instead!I am kind of anal about DVD sets (actually, DVDs & CDs in general!), and I HATE the cardboard box style of DVD case which often gets worn, scuffed, and/or peeling at the edges and corners of the box. In my experience so far, plastic DVD cases do NOT have those problems -- at most, the clear plastic sheet on the outside of the DVD case (into which the paper cover is inserted) *might* get a little wrinkled or soiled/dusty.But the few wrinkles or soiling on the plastic cases is at least something I can live with, UNLIKE the significant scuffing & peeling into white spots/patches on the corners & edges of cardboard cases, which is really aggravating! That is why I'd much rather have a single plastic DVD case, which doesn't get much (if ANY!) edgewear, shelfwear, corner-wear, and/or scuffing & peeling, and is pretty much care-free!In addition, I also have a couple quibbles about this DVD set.The first is that just like the previous season, there is still NO special audio like Dolby Digital, Surround Sound, THX, or DTS. While the picture and sound are still relatively good, considering that this show was made in the 80's, it might have been EVEN BETTER, if it had been remastered with a 21st century audio system.My second quibble is that there is still NO closed-captioning or subtitles available on this DVD set. As I said in my review for Season 1, this is a minor quibble, though many other DVD box-sets, at least have this one basic feature. Unfortunately Punky Brewster does not. Not only that, but with some of the other DVD's that do not have closed captions available, they have at least enabled TV captioning, such that if a TV has a closed-captioning feature built in, then it can still be possible to get captions. But with Punky Brewster, this feature has NOT been enabled, so it does not work.It's a shame because everything else about this DVD set is so great. I just wish that Shout! Factory had considered those with disabilities or language issues and thought to include closed captions, and maybe even separate language tracks (with subtitles, of course!). Not only so that those who don't speak English, as well as those with hearing impairments (the deaf, the elderly, etc.) can watch this wonderful show, but also because sometimes, when Punky or another character is talking quietly or mumbling, its kind of hard to understand, and closed captions would help to decipher mumbled and/or softer-spoken dialogue. Naturally, they would need to raise the price a little to cover that, but I, for one would not have minded (and would not mind) paying a little more for those important features when buying a DVD or especially a DVD box set!Punky Brewster is still TRULY a GEM!!Its really too bad that they just don't make shows like this anymore. I grew up in the 80's and this show is an instant blast to my childhood. The 80's had so many WONDERFUL (not to mention mostly family-friendly!). Punky Brewster, Webster, Mr. Belvedere, Perfect Strangers, Who's the Boss?, Full House, Family Matters, Baby Talk, Head of the Class, Family Ties, Growing Pains, Picket Fences, Life Goes On, and more!Unlike now, when TV is clogged with crap like the reality show rage of Survivor, Fear Factor, and other equally revolting junk.Punky Brewster is a MUST for all 80's fans & 80s kids like me. I strongly encourage not only Punky Brewster fans, but ANYONE with young kids, anyone who is planning on having kids someday, or anyone who liked this show and wants to see a wholesome, sweet, and QUALITY ""family-friendly"" show (though admittedly, on occasion,Punky BrewsterCAN get a bit treacly saccharine-sweet) that everyone can enjoy, to buy this set of Punky Brewster! You won't be sorry! I sure wasn't, and I play these DVDs often!I LOVE PUNKY BREWSTER!Punky Brewster RULES! I've got PUNKY POWER!! :D",5,MORE PUNKY POWER!

873014,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B0006SSNKA,MollyRK,"[4, 4]","The release of this classic children's series has undoubtedly delighted many ""1980's kids"" who remember watching the show. Just as sweet and engaging as it always used to be, ""Punky Brewster"" is great to introduce to a whole new generation of children (but, of course, those of us who are still ""kids at heart"" will probably enjoy it just as much, if not more!)Season 1 focused mainly on the shocking impact that Punky's sudden appearance had in the life of Henry Warnimont, an originally grumpy old man who was used to living as a hermit in his own little apartment. Punky gradually decorated his life, but she herself was also going through insecurity and fear of abandonment.While Season 1 was mostly about Henry and Punky seeking to create a whole new family dynamic for themselves, Season 2 zooms in on Punky, her friends and her 4th grade teacher. Henry is now a warm and devoted fatherly figure to this little girl, and it appears that the writers used this season to really take off with the storyline. Issues pertaining to CPR and drug use are presented with an innocent ""Punky"" touch, and the season ends with an incredible bang when Henry finally adopts Punky as his own. The 5-part episode ""Changes"" is beautifully done and perhaps the biggest success in the show's 4-year run. Here, you get to see how much this old man and little girl love each other and how difficult it was for them to finally get to that glorious end result of being adopted as father and daughter. I often wonder why they didn't save that for the series finale, where it may have fit in on a much more emotional level, but I guess there could have been a variety of reasons for that.I have loved having Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD and cannot wait for Season 3 to come out in the summer. It is, however, a whole different experience to watch this show as an adult. You may be surprised to find how cheesy and silly the storylines are, but as another reviewer here has said, it's important to remember that the series was written for kids. It was not geared to be a family show, but rather something for the young crowd. The jokes are a bit goofy and it is clearly a very youthful rendition of innocence in childhood. In any case, it has all the fun and cutesiness to attract young viewers and is innocent and sweet enough to reel in older crowds, as well.Soleil Moon Frye did a terrific job with this series--for a little kid, she sure had a lot of talent and was capable of transferring a lot of childlike spirit to the screen. She and George Gaynes worked very well alongside one another, and that little Cherie Johnson was always a wonderful asset to the show. Sweet, funny and irresistably charming, she had the most adorable presence. Then, of course, there was Susie Garrett, who was very funny and also brought some great humor to the episodes through her interactions with Gaynes.Good acting, a very sweet plot, and genuinely clean 30-minute fun for everyone.

He teaches Punky how to shoplift, and she and Mike get in trouble.Like the first season's episode that taught about the loss of a pet, this season has a few special episodes that deal with serious issues, such as the one about the Challenger explosion, and the 5 part Changes that deals with Henry being ill and almost losing custody of Punky.Comes with a sheet of stickers, and the bonus features are good.

Great for adults of the 80s to pass onto their children for them to enjoy. If I ever have grandchildren I will definitely be passing down this to them. The cartoon Punky Brewster is an extra bonus. It's like having two dvd's in one.,5,There's nothing like Punky,1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,337,"['brought', 'back', 'childhood', 'Shout', 'factory', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'back', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'Great', 'adults', '80s', 'pass', 'children', 'enjoy', 'ever', 'have', 'grandchildren', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'passing', 'down', 'cartoon', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'extra', 'bonus', 'having', 'two', 'dvd', 'one']",Punky Brewster - Season Two
