It's a very nice mix in this incredibly strange sci-fi film. The story is basically about a woman named Alice who is basically a renegade vampire chick(Think Underworld, but wierder) who is a member of a resistance of vampires trying to prevent the humans from wiping them out, then it turns out the humans have a weapon; which is a child; which has a substance within him that can wipe out the Hemophages(a.k.a. the vampires) or destroy them. So basically the whole story goes from that. This film has gorgeous computer-generated effects, gorgeous action thrills, an awesome protagonist, and a cool storyline. The only issues I have with this movie is the fact it's more computer-generated than realistic and that people will have a hard time appreciating what an awesome one-of-a kind sci-fi movie this is or liking how strange it is.

989854,A34VV92TSLC37R,B000FGGE5Y,Adam Craig,"[3, 5]","Ultraviolet follows the exploits of Violet, played by Milla Jovovich, in a futuristic society in which many citizens are infected with a virus, and then are immediately ""disposed of"" by the government.  Those infected with the virus are called hemophages, or vampires.  In this movie, however, the hemophages don't literally suck the blood from people, they use other sources, such as blood banks or what not to retrieve their fuel.  Violet is a hemophage, who has decided not to take it anymore, and she joins up with a hemophage resistance group.  When the humans discover a ""weapon"" that will destroy all hemophages, the hemophages send in Violet to retrieve the weapon before the government can use it.  When Violet discovers that this weapon is really a young boy, she decides to betray everyone she's ever known for some random child that she knows nothing about.First, let me start with the positives of the film.  Firstly, the film is visually stunning.  It looks very similar to Wimmer's previous film, Equilibrium, but Ultraviolet is a lot more colorful than the dark environment of Equilibrium.  Secondly, the action scenes in the film actually aren't all that bad.  The first 20 minutes of the film is straight up action, and after that point, I actually had my hopes up a little bit.  Yes, the effects look fake most of the time, but the film was obviously trying to look like a comic book, and it succeeds in that aspect.Now, the negatives, which are fairly numerous, so I will try to be brief.  The first, and worst, negative of the film is the acting.  Simply put, it is horrendous.  Milla Jovovich has never been known for her acting ability, but that is why she is normally in films that really require no emotion from the leading lady.  Unfortunately, the writing in this film requires Violet to actually show emotion and caring for this boy that she is protecting.  It isn't just Jovovich's lack of acting ability, though, it is also the inept script that Kurt Wimmer put together.  One second, Violet is portrayed as an extremely lethal, uncaring vampire, who will kill anyone in her way.  The next moment, and for no reason, we are supposed to believe that Violet would betray everyone she's ever known just after seeing the boy,  not even talking to him or finding out exactly why he is considered a ""weapon.""  The ""Archcardinal,"" the villain, is also a horrible actor.  I don't even know this guy's name, and I never want to.  Portrayed as the classic movie villain, he has so many cheesy lines that just make you want to laugh, no matter how serious the film is trying to be.It is also amazing how the film drags in the middle.  Even though the film runs a meager 85 minutes, it seemed like it was at least two hours long, and that is really unbelievable.  When there isn't action occurring onscreen, it is pointless dialogue about a plot that the viewer knows absolutely nothing about, except for a brief overview by Violet at the beginning of the film.  Ultimately, I just found myself sitting in the theater, just waiting for the film to finally come to the end, and when it did, I was overjoyed.The really sad thing about the film is that the basic setup could actually be used to make an interesting, possibly good movie.  I think that Wimmer was trying to send a message through the film, as he did with Equilibrium, but he failed as a filmmaker on just about every level in this film.  Whatever message Wimmer was trying to send, it was completely lost in the grade-school acting, boring dialogue, and ridiculously overdone (but enjoyable) action scenes.  Her name is Violet, and she is in a movie that you definitely won't understand (or like).",1,Really couldn't have been much worse,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,3677,"['Ultraviolet', 'exploits', 'Violet', 'played', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'futuristic', 'society', 'many', 'citizens', 'are', 'infected', 'virus', 'then', 'are', 'immediately', 'disposed', 'government', 'infected', 'virus', 'are', 'called', 'hemophages', 'vampires', 'movie', 'however', 'hemophages', 'do', ""n't"", 'literally', 'suck', 'blood', 'people', 'use', 'other', 'sources', 'such', 'blood', 'banks', 'what', 'not', 'retrieve', 'fuel', 'Violet', 'hemophage', 'who', 'decided', 'not', 'take', 'anymore', 'up', 'hemophage', 'resistance', 'group', 'When', 'humans', 'discover', 'weapon', 'will', 'destroy', 'hemophages', 'hemophages', 'send', 'Violet', 'retrieve', 'weapon', 'government', 'can', 'use', 'When', 'Violet', 'weapon', 'really', 'young', 'boy', 'betray', 'everyone', 'ever', 'known', 'random', 'child', 'nothing', 'about.First', 'let', 'start', 'positives', 'film', 'Firstly', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'very', 'similar', 'Wimmer', 'previous', 'film', 'Equilibrium', 'Ultraviolet', 'lot', 'more', 'colorful', 'dark', 'environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Secondly', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'actually', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'straight', 'up', 'action', 'point', 'actually', 'had', 'hopes', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'Yes', 'effects', 'look', 'fake', 'most', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'trying', 'look', 'comic', 'book', 'aspect.Now', 'negatives', 'are', 'fairly', 'numerous', 'will', 'try', 'be', 'brief', 'first', 'worst', 'negative', 'film', 'acting', 'Simply', 'put', 'horrendous', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'never', 'been', 'known', 'acting', 'ability', 'why', 'normally', 'films', 'really', 'require', 'emotion', 'leading', 'lady', 'Unfortunately', 'writing', 'film', 'Violet', 'actually', 'show', 'emotion', 'caring', 'boy', 'protecting', ""n't"", 'just', 'Jovovich', 'lack', 'acting', 'ability', 'though', 'also', 'inept', 'script', 'Kurt', 'Wimmer', 'put', 'together', 'One', 'second', 'Violet', 'portrayed', 'extremely', 'lethal', 'uncaring', 'vampire', 'who', 'will', 'kill', 'anyone', 'way', 'next', 'moment', 'reason', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'Violet', 'would', 'betray', 'everyone', 'ever', 'known', 'just', 'seeing', 'boy', 'not', 'even', 'talking', 'finding', 'out', 'exactly', 'why', 'considered', 'weapon', 'Archcardinal', 'villain', 'also', 'horrible', 'actor', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'guy', 'name', 'never', 'want', 'Portrayed', 'classic', 'movie', 'villain', 'so', 'many', 'cheesy', 'lines', 'just', 'make', 'want', 'laugh', 'matter', 'how', 'serious', 'film', 'trying', 'be.It', 'also', 'amazing', 'how', 'film', 'middle', 'Even', 'film', 'meager', '85', 'minutes', 'seemed', 'was', 'least', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'really', 'unbelievable', 'When', ""n't"", 'action', 'occurring', 'onscreen', 'pointless', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'viewer', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'brief', 'overview', 'Violet', 'beginning', 'film', 'Ultimately', 'just', 'found', 'sitting', 'theater', 'just', 'waiting', 'film', 'finally', 'come', 'end', 'when', 'did', 'was', 'overjoyed.The', 'really', 'sad', 'thing', 'film', 'basic', 'setup', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'used', 'make', 'interesting', 'possibly', 'good', 'movie', 'think', 'Wimmer', 'was', 'trying', 'send', 'message', 'film', 'did', 'Equilibrium', 'failed', 'filmmaker', 'just', 'level', 'film', 'message', 'Wimmer', 'was', 'trying', 'send', 'was', 'completely', 'lost', 'grade-school', 'acting', 'boring', 'dialogue', 'ridiculously', 'overdone', 'enjoyable', 'action', 'scenes', 'name', 'Violet', 'movie', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand']",N/A

989859,A33H8DC3ZG58T0,B000FGGE5Y,"Amazon Customer ""gorgon-13""","[4, 4]","Well this ones a missed opportunity, a film that in some ways tries too hard and yet seems to lack faith in itself. The director has clearly tried for a visual style reminiscent of the graphic comics, but he hasn't taken it far enough and instead of a Sin City type look, it comes over as garish with CGI that looks cheap rather than having the desired stylised effect. It also has one of the worst most intrusive scores I can remember.It starts at full blast with Violet infiltrating a government lab and stealing a package, when discovered the shooting starts and goes on and on and on ad-infinitum. The seemingly invulnerable Violet leaves a trail of devastation that would leave The Bride or Schwarzenegger in his prime green with envy. The chase scene also introduces some of the most idiotic high tech concepts ever committed to film, including internal body weapons stores and a device that supposedly changes the direction of gravity, allowing Violet to drive her motor bike up walls or stand on the ceiling, sounds dumb ? Believe me it is.Back at base Violet discovers that the package she has recovered isn't a weapon as such, it's a child. When faced with her erstwhile associates determination to destroy the BoyBomb, she gets all maternal and decides to save him. As a result she ends up at odds with her friends and having to kill a load of others including the Blood Chinois, a group whose only function appears to be one scene as cannon fodder.After all this the film almost seems to run out of breath and in the few moments it pauses the film almost starts to work, we get some glimpses into who the boy Six is, why Violet does what she does and what's going on. But then cast and crew get their second wind and the mad dash for the finish line is on.There is a slight twist to the end, but it's not something you'll care about and the bit with Violet and Six starting their happy ever after life style ending, despite both having been killed in the movie is twee and after all the slaughter that lead to it just plain silly, I suspect the input of some asinine focus group.Badly paced with a poor script and a director who seems to be trying to build on what he created in Equilibrium, but with remarkably little success.

I wasn't expecting a whole lot, just some decent action and a nifty dystopia, something along the lines of Aeon Flux, Equilibrium, and (of course) The Matrix.Ultraviolet starts off with a bang. Milla is a superb action heroine, as always, and she dazzles with a wonderful combination of high-tech gadgetry (she's got an anti-gravity device!), high-speed chases, and high-skill martial arts. Combo in an intriguing (if a bit long and draggy) voice-over involving vampires, and Milla's mysteriously changing hair color, and this should be a perfect mindless Friday night flick.Unfortunately, the action slows to a crawl after the first twenty minutes (as do the cool hair color changes - it will remain disappointingly black for the rest of the movie, despite all the cool changes you saw in the previews), and you won't get to see too many more fancy moves until the final race to the finish. The filler dialogue is teeth-grindingly bad, with Milla having approximately eighteen earnest heart-to-hearts with the Capture/Rescue Kid. Some of these heart-to-hearts occur back to back and while enemy soldiers are closing in, and the resulting overexposure of Milla's tender side (which the savvy user grasped in the initial opening voice over, for crying out loud) feels like a hammer to the temples. She's a vampire! She's dying! She's saddened by the loss of her pregnancy! She's bonding with the child! Yeah, we got it.Really, this would have been a much better film if the writers had trusted the audience to get it and just cut 90% of the filler dialogue and just left us 'silent scenes' instead of Milla dragging her reluctant charge around this world gone mad.

The visuals were amazing this was one of the most ultramodern movies I had ever seen. Most movies that take place in the future looks like today's world. U are able to tell something is out of sync, somehow. But Kurt Wimmer had a vision, a true vison. Non of the buildings were recognizable all of the vehicles were prototypes. U had a bracelets for credit cards? Dispensible telephones that pop out of a machines? The set and architecture were all original. Even though they were CGI's at least there was time and thought put into it. The sets were very colorful and the costumes were cool. This was extremley well made as far as creativity was concerned.The fight sequences were bad ass ! Yes, there were a couple of fights that were too short. And the odds were just unbelievable ! But for the most part these were some of the best fight sequences I have seen since Kill bill ! Especially when she took out all those guards in that library and that orchestrated music was playing. At the end of the fight she held her gun up in the air, Kneeled down with sprinkles falling ! That was bad ass ! I almost wanted to get up and clap after that. I was high off of adrenaline the whole time I was in the theater. I hadn't felt like that since kill bill ! Milla was stunning throughout and very tough through the film. Her confidence and straight forwardness, made u really believe in what she was doing. Everyone's arguement was that she was no stronger than anyone she was fighting. Well ! have u ever been pissed off ? When someone is pissed they can do the impossible. And she was a very pissed and a angry young lady. Which the explained at the beginning of the movie Why? So in a since I can see that it is quite possible for her to take out some of the people she did. The movie opens up with 40 mins of none stop action ! This is before u get to any type of plot which  I felt was a new and interesting way to open ! I love the matrix as much as anyone else did ! But in all honesty after the first, reloaded offered very little more. At times the Matrix got to preachy and put me to sleep ! Equilibrum showed Kurt Wimmer's potiental as an amazing fight coordinator ! But was illustrated very little because of Equilibrium's long drawn out plot ! In this film he just showed out and gave us nothing but action. It seemed like he was trying too hard but it was effective ! I have never seen ANYTHING like this ! I can honestley say with a straight face! I am not a action move lover because they bore me ! But this was a visually stunning film, I don't care what anyone says ! This was much more appealing to me than Resident Evil: Apocalyse ! That  had wooden acting and not so great effects compared to this ! But Ultraviolet delivers something abit more ! If your looking for ""Brokeback mountain"" this movie isn't for you. This is a artistic piece for people that like visuals!The movie critics are horrible ! Noone can appreaciate a fun unusual unique movie anymore. Its a shame when movies like Underworld: Evolutions, Bloodrayne (Better than most), Equilibrium, May, High Tension, Mulholland Dr and Donnie Darko. Can't get any awards, recongnition or decent ratings ! But Sh*t like Brokeback Mountian and Memoirs of Geisa this is the Sh*t that people think it Great ? What is the world coming too ? And King Kong ? Something that has been made twice already ? Please David Lynch, Len Wisemen, Lucky Mckee and Kurt Wimmer don't give up in film making ! There are still people out there who can appreciate real art and not ""Tear jerkers !"" And how is it that ""Million dollar baby"" got voted out over Kill bill,last year at the Emmy's or Oscars ? Who knows ! See that is what I am talking about ! Even Hustle and Flow ? That was crap but that is what the world has come too ! Oh well !

This little-seen film when it was first released in the theaters soon garnered a cult following once on DVD. What was not to like about Wimmer's directorial debut. It had stylish action, a plot seemningly taken out from an Orwellian playbook and a cast of good to great performances. This sophomore effort from Wimmer got my interest the moment I read about it in the trades. It seemed like a continuation of his take on future dystopia but with a medical twist. I expected alot, though not too much that I overhyped the film to even myself, but what I finally saw once the film hit the theater was something that was a total mess.Ultraviolet takes place in another future dystopia where the world became ruled by a medical establishment that's become religiously fanatical in its quest to protect the world from a plague that genetically-resequenced humans into vampire-like beings called Hemophages. The main character Violet, as played by genre favorite Milla Jovovich, is such a being who is now a member of a dying and hunted species. Violet would've been a cool character if she was abit more fleshed out, so to speak. The character in the film was pretty much indestructible despite the growing odds she had to go up against. I understood from the intro sequence that Ultraviolet was playing on the comic-book style of storytelling and characterization, but Wimmer went overboard in making Violet too Ultra. The story itself doesn't even rise to the level of basic barebones. The ideas presented in the film were still interesting, but it seemed that the audience entered the film sometime during the middle part of the story. So many ideas were being forcefed to the audience through medical mumbo-jumbo that after awhile I just tuned it out. The story pretty much rushed from one talky scene to the next with techno-soundtracked action sequences filling out the gaps.The action looks to have been rehashed from the gunkata of Equilibrium. As much as it would've looked cool in Ultraviolet, the PG-13 rating meant no blood and all the kills done so cleanly or offscreen that one almost thought they were watching something made-for-tv. Kurt Wimmer does know how to create action scenes. One in particular involves Violet on a motorcycle against several helicopter gunships. This was the only scene in the film where I actually enjoyed what I was watching. The soft, dreamlike look of the film even gave the sequence a very surrealistic feel to it. But in the end it wasn't enough to save the film. The rest of the action scenes look to be too choreographed and again the bloodless look to them didn't exactly make them better. Milla Jovovich did look good as Violet and earning a reputation as the premiere female action star, but she could've done and chosen a better project to showcase her talents.Wimmer really regressed alot with this second film, but rumors abound that it might not be all his fault. I don't doubt that talks of the studio getting overly involved in the editing and writing process of the film could've led to the mess that was the fiished product.

Inaddition to the similarities to other action romps, some of the sequences in this futuristic shoot-em up look like bad effects from TV's Power Rangers.  The jerky camera work and impossible stunts are not always very believable or likable.  That being said, Ultra Violet can be a lot of fun if you watch it with the same vein you might watch an old martial arts film.  It's not a cinematic beauty and Milla Jovovich has done better stuff than this, but it actually is better paced than the afore mentioned Aeon Flux.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 2]","Milla Jovovich appeared in one of my all-time favorite sci-fi action comedies (The Fifth Element), but she also holds the title of ""Most Overused Female Actress"" in some really shoddy flicks (Resident Evil, Dummy, and Return to the Blue Lagoon just to touch on a few). So I hesitate whenever I see her name attached to a title. Perhaps her agent needs to be a bit more selective when handing her manuscripts.So it is with a heavy heart that I have to say her unfortunate role selections seem to have no end in sight with the addition of ULTRAVIOLET to her sagging film repertoire.Vampires (aka Hemophages) have been done to death, but I don't mind that. If a story is interesting and contains vampires, hey, that's fine by me. But shoving Milla into a body-fitting, white leather outfit and having her kick [...] in almost every scene makes me think that much more could've been made out of this film rather than just a vampiric female ruffian who's deadly with a blade. Swinging swords and Matrix-like action sequences were all one gets to see here ...that and some really bad CGI (harkening back to the days of TRON).The story of vampires and humans battling for supremacy is nothing new to film, too, and it would've been nice to see more character development surrounding Milla's Violet character and that of the main antagonist, Vicecardinum Ferdinand Daxus played by Nick Chinlund. But we just are led to believe that the two hate each other because they're on opposite sides of the human/vampire equation. Or are they? It seems the scriptwriters/filmmakers couldn't make up their minds about that either. What a mess.The story tries to pull a sympathetic chord with the audience by explaining that Violet lost a child in-utero, so when she starts feeling empathy for Six (Cameron Blight), a young boy who carries a virus that can wipe out all vampires (or can he?), we (the audience) are supposed to support her decision not to kill the very child who could kill her. But the emotional impact is nil, again, since almost all of the film time is dedicated to swordplay, killing, and showing us how nice Milla looks in her leathers while decapitating a few hundred bad guys at a time.There have been comparisons made between Ultraviolet and AEON FLUX. I've seen and rated both of these films and found the latter much more entertaining than the former. Although both films had deadly women as their prime protagonists, Aeon Flux actually had a story behind it with some intriguing concepts, while Ultraviolet simply put a futuristic bent on a worn-out theme.",2,Ultra-Action With No Ultra-Characters,1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,2563,"['Milla', 'Jovovich', 'appeared', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'comedies', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'also', 'title', 'Most', 'Overused', 'Female', 'Actress', 'really', 'shoddy', 'flicks', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Dummy', 'Return', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'just', 'touch', 'few', 'hesitate', 'whenever', 'see', 'name', 'attached', 'title', 'Perhaps', 'agent', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'selective', 'when', 'handing', 'manuscripts.So', 'heavy', 'heart', 'have', 'say', 'unfortunate', 'role', 'selections', 'seem', 'have', 'end', 'sight', 'addition', 'ULTRAVIOLET', 'sagging', 'film', 'repertoire.Vampires', 'Hemophages', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'story', 'interesting', 'vampires', 'hey', 'fine', 'shoving', 'Milla', 'body-fitting', 'white', 'leather', 'outfit', 'having', 'kick', '[', ']', 'almost', 'scene', 'think', 'much', 'more', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'made', 'film', 'rather', 'just', 'vampiric', 'female', 'ruffian', 'who', 'deadly', 'blade', 'Swinging', 'swords', 'Matrix-like', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'one', 'see', 'here', 'really', 'bad', 'CGI', 'harkening', 'back', 'days', 'TRON', '.The', 'story', 'vampires', 'humans', 'battling', 'supremacy', 'nothing', 'new', 'film', 'too', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'surrounding', 'Milla', 'Violet', 'character', 'main', 'antagonist', 'Vicecardinum', 'Ferdinand', 'Daxus', 'played', 'Nick', 'Chinlund', 'just', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'two', 'hate', 'other', ""'re"", 'opposite', 'sides', 'human/vampire', 'equation', 'are', 'scriptwriters/filmmakers', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'minds', 'What', 'mess.The', 'story', 'tries', 'pull', 'sympathetic', 'chord', 'audience', 'explaining', 'Violet', 'lost', 'child', 'in-utero', 'when', 'feeling', 'empathy', 'Six', 'Cameron', 'Blight', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'virus', 'can', 'wipe', 'out', 'vampires', 'can', 'audience', 'are', 'supposed', 'support', 'decision', 'not', 'kill', 'very', 'child', 'who', 'could', 'kill', 'emotional', 'impact', 'nil', 'again', 'almost', 'film', 'time', 'dedicated', 'swordplay', 'killing', 'showing', 'how', 'nice', 'Milla', 'leathers', 'decapitating', 'few', 'hundred', 'bad', 'guys', 'have', 'been', 'comparisons', 'made', 'Ultraviolet', 'AEON', 'FLUX', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'rated', 'films', 'found', 'latter', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'former', 'films', 'had', 'deadly', 'women', 'prime', 'protagonists', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'actually', 'had', 'story', 'intriguing', 'concepts', 'Ultraviolet', 'simply', 'put', 'futuristic', 'bent', 'worn-out', 'theme']",N/A

Not ONE person ever gets a hit on her. No bullet, no punch, no kick, not even a lucky swing with an electric baton.The film is about Mutants. she is a mutant, and so is the main bad guy. All mutants have different powers, but all can see in the dark, to different degrees. Theyset up the fact that the Main bad guy is a super mutant. He can see in Total Darkness, as if it were high Noon. He fights her, and then turns off the lights toget an advantage. She Lights her metal sword on fire to see in the dark. They fight, and he disarms her. Now at this point the writers must have taken abreak, and forgot who had what power, because now the bad guy can no longer see in the dark. He needs to use the flaming sword to find her.

Erland,"[2, 3]","'Ultraviolet' is the most recent arrival from an evergrowing number of films with plots dealing with beautiful and deadly warrior women in sexy skin tight costumes fighting injustice. Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil) is back once again doing what she does best, terminate evil.Set far into the future, after most of mankind has been wiped out by a devastating biological holocaust those that remain have been divided into two warring camps, humans and hemophages. The hemophages are comprised of humans who have been infected by a virius that bestows vampire-like physical attributes and physical abilities, but also accelerates the aging process. Ultraviolet is the most deadly hemophage assassin who has been sent on a mission that will change the balance of power forever if successful. That is if she decides to complete the assignment as originally planned.Yes the storyline does lack substance but there is so much non-stop action in this film there really isn't much room between fight scenes to fit one in. The special effects are definitely not the best I've ever seen, but passable. As for Milla, she says it herself, ""I'm a Titan, a monolith. Nothing can stop me.""

The special effects were great, but I wish they would have left out the comic book style textures. Also when a window is shot from the outside the glass isn't suppose to shatter outward. There was alot of that type of ""well it looks good, who cares about physics"" mentality in the making. The graphics of the gravity manipulation device were top notch but brief. The story revovles around a vampire or ""Hemophage"" as they call them in the movie. The world is without all diseases save one; the hemophage virus. It is a virus that for some reason people don't want to catch, even though it gives the ""sick"" person super strength, speed and agility. I'll never understand some of the underlying character relationships and I don't think anyone will unless they read the comic or investigate the pre-movie story. The characters are likable but not well developed. The main character, Ultraviolet, is very likable and very hot played by Milla Jovovich. There is a new cure discovered and Ultraviolet tries to steal it before it can be used. I thought it was a good movie, border-line great even, but the characters aren't developed and the story seemed to take a back seat to the fighting/action sequences. All in all a good sci-fi flick.

A great number of those are student films, independent films made by amateurs, low-budget genre pictures, and Rob Schneider movies.  In other words: really, they never stood a chance of being good.Then, there are medium- to large-budget films, such as ""Battlefield Earth,"" ""Batman and Robin,"" or ""Howard the Duck,"" films about which it can only be said, ""Shouldn't someone have been able to do better than this?""  These are monumentally awful movies made by people who, on a fundamental level, ought to have known better.""Ultraviolet,"" as far as I'm concerned, is a new low amongst that latter category.  It is so bad that if I ever have a conversation with someone who honestly claims to have enjoyed it, I cannot envision failing to want to choke said person.  I'm civilized, so I won't do it; but I'll think about it.  A lot.On every single level, this film is a pathetic failure.  Milla Jovovich is awful.  Cameron Bright is one of the worst child actors I've ever seen appear in numerous movies; he was similarly terrible in ""Running Scared,"" ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" an episode of ""Stargate SG1,"" and the otherwise good ""Thank You For Smoking"" . . . and that was in 2006 alone!  William Fichtner is mediocre, whereas he is usually terrific.  Nick Chinlund, whom I remember fondly from an excellent ""X-Files"" episode (the title of which escapes me), is one of the lamest villains in history.Lest you think this is sounding ""so bad it's good,"" no, stop, that ain't it.  It's just bad.  People ride motorcycles down the sides of buildings because they've flipped a switch inside their bodies to alter their gravity.  WHAT ABOUT THE BIKE'S GRAVITY?!?  LAME!The action scenes, like the one I just ranted about, are laughable.  Not exciting, not well-conceived, not original; not even campy.  It's like watching stunt choreography done by someone who had never seen a movie before, but had been told about ""The Matrix"" and thought it sounded nifty.  Ridiculous . . . and I'm not usually grumpy about fight scenes, I don't care whether they're realistic or not.  These just suck.There is a subplot about how some of the characters are ""hemophages,"" or vampires, but they don't do anything that vampires do; they don't suck blood, they don't burn in the sun, they . . . oh, they just don't make any sense.  Occasionally, it looks like they have fangs, but they disappear during most of the scenes with no explanation.The color scheme is preposterous.  The entire movie -- and I'm not making this up or exaggerating in the tiniest degree -- looks like a Revlon ad.  Stylish?!?  No, sir.  Only if you're a chump, and a 13-year-old one at that.  Every single scene screams, LOOK . . . HOW . . . COOL . . . I . . . AM!  And yet, not one single cool thing ever happens.  NOT . . . ONE.What more can I say?  If you liked this, I hate you.  I also hate your mother, your various uncles, your uncles' barbers, your elementary-school best friend, and the last person who sold you a taco.  And if you haven't seen ""Battlefield Earth,"" check it out, cause you will dig it the most.If you buy this DVD, I hate you more, to the slender extent that that is possible.Need more testimonial?I work at a movie theatre as a projectionist; I get paid to watch movies before they come out, and even on the clock, I felt like I was being ripped off while watching this tomfoolery.  I almost clocked out and left; this movie is seriously THAT bad.  But I didn't.  You want to know why I stayed and suffered?I did it for you.That's right, I did it so you don't have to.  I wept with rage; I shouted at the projector and begged it to break; I threw up in my mouth; I resolved to never talk down ""Big Momma's House 2"" again.  I did all of those things and more.

The other elements of Ultraviolet are all quite good, and deserve more credit.First of all, Milla Jovovich gives one of her best performances in this movie.  She looks absolutely great, and her physicality is better than ever.  She is nuanced in showing both sides of her character:  a hardened killing machine, and a caring, loving (surrogate) mother.  Second, Ultraviolet's story is much better than average, engaging and unpredictable.All that said, Ultraviolet fails in a core element, its pure cgi sequences.  Ultraviolet's world is reasonably interesting, and there are a number of good sets provided in the movie.  Most of the movie looks good to great.  But the director and producers tried something new with the cgi, and here they failed miserably.  This becomes particularly gruesome with pure cgi sequences.

In the 2006 flick Ultraviolet, these color tricks are used in every single sequence, indeed in each and every frame. Ultraviolet looks incredible, but ultimately it is just another flash and trash flick.Ultraviolet is a painfully bad mixture of fantastic cinematography and awful acting and direction. The film is basically a bad Matrix ripoff. And the script is just plain bizarre.In the future America depicted in Ultraviolet, there are two different kinds of people. The first group act just like characters from the Matrix movies, including the ability to dodge bullets and the like. They are also at heart vampires, although this aspect of the movie was poorly handled to the point that the vampire bit was confusing. The other group consists of normal everyday folks. Of course, the normal folks are at heart fascists and hate the Matrix types.The level of acting in Ulatraviolet is horrible. You can tell that the actors are in this movie just for the pay checks. They just go through the motions, not even trying to act.This is not the first movie directed by Kurt Wimmer that was basically a ripoff of The Matrix trilogy. He also made the hit Equilibrium. As a director, Wimmer specializes in lots of flashy action sequences.

Ultimately, it falls short of that and lands right in the run of the mill pile.ULTRAVIOLET is NOT a waste of time. It has some phenominal technical moments. Not to mention, some very cool and memorable fight scenes and special effects. Milla Jovovich looks very believable wielding swords and battling hords of attackers. She's also very cool and gives a solid performance. In fact, the entire mood is engaging.So, where does Ultraviolet fall short? There are many things, but I believe the most important thing is that the movie plays like a VIDEO GAME STORY.You may say, ""It's supposed to. It's a video game movie."" But, turning a video game into a movie is a chance to give a different dimension to a video game character. Video game stories are usually very one dimensional. Find bad guy after fighting through hords and levels of his henchmen and eventually destroy him. That is exactly what you get... the movie plays like levels... and if you've ever heard the term ""Hack and Slash"". That is what the movie is.Don't get me wrong. I love the action. I love the battle scenes. But, it just seems to be one after the other. One immense battle scene after the next, and when it's all said and done.... there wasn't much of a story to be told... just like a video game.Another thing that bugged me was the beginning... the movie has to explain the world... the virus... the new species... the side effects... the war that is raging... and then I noticed... WE'RE ALREADY 10 minutes into the movie!!  Dear lord! Tighten this script up man! Movies should grab you in the first 5 minutes. And then, after the 10 minute explanation... you're thinking, ""Is this the second coming of DUNE? Is the movie gonna be that complicated?"" And as I've already said... it isn't.This needed more side stories. More emotion. More character building. More essence, more dread and less Milla Jovovich taking on 30 bad guys at a time... 7 or 8 times... or maybe it was more than that. However many it was, it felt like watching SOMEBODY ELSE play a video game after the 2nd time.Maybe it would have been more fun had you been able to control the action with a controller... but ultimately, ULTRAVIOLET sort of falls flat. It's a cool looking movie with a very hip Milla Jovovich giving it her all, but with a very one dimensional story that leaves you with an unfulfilled taste in your mouth when it's all said and done.",3,HACK and SLASH,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,2537,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'more', 'did', 'creators', 'missed', 'lot', 'opportunities', 'make', 'memorable', 'long', 'lasting', 'film', 'Ultimately', 'short', 'right', 'run', 'mill', 'pile.ULTRAVIOLET', 'NOT', 'waste', 'time', 'phenominal', 'technical', 'moments', 'Not', 'mention', 'very', 'cool', 'memorable', 'fight', 'scenes', 'special', 'effects', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'very', 'believable', 'wielding', 'swords', 'battling', 'hords', 'attackers', 'also', 'very', 'cool', 'solid', 'performance', 'fact', 'entire', 'mood', 'engaging.So', 'where', 'Ultraviolet', 'fall', 'short', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'believe', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'movie', 'VIDEO', 'GAME', 'STORY.You', 'may', 'say', 'supposed', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'turning', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'chance', 'give', 'different', 'dimension', 'video', 'game', 'character', 'Video', 'game', 'stories', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'one', 'dimensional', 'Find', 'bad', 'guy', 'fighting', 'hords', 'levels', 'henchmen', 'eventually', 'destroy', 'exactly', 'what', 'get', 'movie', 'levels', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'term', 'Hack', 'Slash', 'what', 'movie', 'is.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'action', 'love', 'battle', 'scenes', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'other', 'One', 'immense', 'battle', 'scene', 'next', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'just', 'video', 'game.Another', 'thing', 'bugged', 'was', 'beginning', 'movie', 'explain', 'world', 'virus', 'new', 'species', 'side', 'effects', 'war', 'raging', 'then', 'noticed', 'WE', ""'RE"", 'ALREADY', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Dear', 'lord', 'Tighten', 'script', 'up', 'man', 'Movies', 'should', 'grab', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'then', '10', 'minute', 'explanation', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'second', 'coming', 'DUNE', 'movie', 'gon', 'be', 'complicated', ""'ve"", 'already', 'said', 'needed', 'more', 'side', 'stories', 'More', 'emotion', 'More', 'character', 'building', 'More', 'essence', 'more', 'dread', 'less', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'taking', '30', 'bad', 'guys', 'time', '7', '8', 'times', 'maybe', 'was', 'more', 'However', 'many', 'was', 'felt', 'watching', 'SOMEBODY', 'ELSE', 'play', 'video', 'game', '2nd', 'time.Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fun', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'control', 'action', 'controller', 'ultimately', 'ULTRAVIOLET', 'sort', 'falls', 'flat', 'cool', 'looking', 'movie', 'very', 'hip', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'giving', 'very', 'one', 'dimensional', 'story', 'unfulfilled', 'taste', 'mouth', 'when', 'said', 'done']",N/A

However, unlike most films that were terrible out of the gate, this movie ultimately does have at least a couple of neat ideas and some cool visuals but it's barely held together by a tiny thread, bad performances, dialogue, CG and a weak story.It's the future and mankind has been partially wiped out by a new virus, turning people into Hemophages. Vampire-teethed with moves out of the Matrix but with a short life-span, they've been looking for the cure for a long time. Their existence is threatened though when a new weapon is revealed and Violet, a kick-butt kind of girl with a weird need to change the color of her hair and clothes frequently, intercepts it. Turns out the weapon is actually a boy with special blood that Violet has to protect while trying to kill those who stand in their way. If it sounds cliche and cheesy to read, it's because it was cheesy and cliche to say.A lot of these movies are obviously geared towards the action junkie type with fast fight choreography which gets hampered by MTV-affected editing like the camera can't sit still for more than 2 seconds. It's a shame though since there's at least some cool ideas here. There's a gravity...thing that doesn't get rid of gravity so much as alter it, allowing Violet to fall through ceilings or walk along them and in one logic-stretching scene, ride a motorcycle across a building before switching gears and riding up it. It's a really cool visual idea(if a bit taken from Episode II and probably some other movie I never saw) where Violet has a sword fight in darkness with the only light coming from their swords that are on fire. Unfortunately the film is just marred by practically everything(except for William Fichtner, seen in films like Armageddon, Perfect Storm or Contact). I can't tell whether this is a double-dip film in the future or they knew the film wasn't going to be a hit so they just put minimal extras. We have a commentary by star Milla Jovovich rather than the director and we have a rather fluffy making-of you've seen everywhere.Should you buy this? I'm going to have to say no.

That's the first line of dialog heard from the film Ultraviolet (2006)...after watching the movie last night, I think the following would have been more appropriate...""Hello. My name is Violet and I was born into a movie you may not understand (or even like).""  Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer (Sphere, Equilibrium), the film stars Milla Jovovich (Dazed and Confused, The Fifth Element, Resident Evil).  Also appearing is Cameron Bright (X-Men: The Last Stand), Nick Chinlund (Con Air, The Chronicles of Riddick), Sebastien Andrieu, and William Fichtner (Heat, The Perfect Storm).As the movie, set in a messed up future (isn't that always the case?), begins we see some giant bowling balls dropped from the air into a building, and once inside the balls turn into deadly assassins...well, that's a pretty neat trick...anyway, some stuff happens, which leads into a lengthy flashback with voiceover by Jovovich.  Apparently, some time ago, a nasty virus was found in Eastern Europe, one which Western powers tried to modify in order to create super soldiers or some such thing, but all they really ended up doing was creating a nastier form of the virus, one which gives it's victims sharper eyesight, acute hearing, enhanced strength, superior healing abilities, and vampire fangs...so what's the downside?  Well I tell you...the victims are generally sensitive to light and have an extremely shortened lifespan.  Seems those affected, known as Hemophages, were then rounded up by the norms and put into camps for experimentation, and those still on the loose formed an underground resistance movement, of which Violet (Jovovich) is a member.  All right, as the flashback/background stuff comes to a close, we find out Vice Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus (Chinlund), the egomaniacal tyrant ruler of the norms has developed a new super weapon, one that supposedly will eliminate the Hemophage threat once and for all, but Violet nicks it through a lengthy and involved series of high-octane action sequences.  As it turns out, the weapon just happens to be an idiot child named Six (Bright), whose blood, while deadly to Hemophages, may also contain a cure.  Violet soon finds herself stuck in the middle as the leader of the Hemophages, some Euro trash named Nerva (Andrieu) wants the kid dead, while the Vice Cardinal wants back what's his...what follows are numerous dead end scenes between Violet and the kid, lots of running around, some fight sequences, some back door dealing, and ultimately a final showdown as Violet battles her way through an army into the belly of the beast (the Arch Ministry building) to face off against the Vice Cardinal himself, who has some serious secrets of his own...By the end of this film I was somewhat aggravated...why?  A number of reasons, but the main one being it seemed like the story was a patchwork of ideas and concepts, none of them developed particularly well.  I did like all the action sequences up front, but once those passed, we were left with having to sit through a whole lot of rotten acting and goofy dialog, the latter being the weakest element of this film, for me, at least.  One example in particular happens after Violet liberates Six, and is on the run.  After a close encounter with armed authorities, Violet asks Six ""Are you damaged?""  Why not just ask ""Are you hurt?""...I'll tell you why...because it's the future and asking someone if they're `damaged' sounds a lot cooler than asking them if they're hurt, at least in Wimmer's mind, I think.  In my mind it just came off as idiotic...I've read the studio re-cut some of the film prior to its release, and even removed some sequences (I read the original film ran about a half hour longer).  Did this meddling hurt the movie, resulting in a less than desirable end product?  I don't think so, as the flaws seemed ingrained regardless of any tinkering (for a prime example of this go rent the theatrical and renegade DVD releases of the 1991 film Highlander II: The Quickening and tell me which is better).  I liked the exteriors, some of the special effects were pretty spiffy (some seemed ridiculously phony), and the fight sequences, for the most part, were fairly engaging, but the slower moments in the middle really caused the feature to drag out.  I found it rather annoying near the end when Violet, the one woman army, was invading the Arch Ministry building, and we'd see her come up against a whole mess of guards, only to cut to a scene with her coming through a door, and beyond the door we see the guards from the previous scene lying dead.  I did learn a lot from this film, including the following...1. Milla Jovovich sure likes to show off her midriff (and I like to see it).2. Body armor in the future is pretty ineffectual given it's tendency to shatter like glass when struck.3. Germophobia runs wild in the future, to the extent of affecting fashions as people don designer air masks and surgical gowns.4. In the future you'll be able to carry small to medium sized children around inside fancy, fashionable briefcases that double as backpacks.5. Uzis fitted with blades that stick out from the bottom seems like overkill (and kinda dumb).6. Extremely long hair can be detrimental to its owner during hand-to-hand combat.7. The biohazard symbol seems an awkward and impractical design for a building.8. In the future most all interiors will be designed to look like bad discoth&egrave;ques.9. Milla Jovovich's character seems the only one who actually knows how to fight.10. Milla Jovovich's character can literally pull futuristic gizmos and weaponry out of her ash.11. Sword usage returns to fashion in the future.12. What's the only thing cooler than a sword fight sequence?  A flaming sword fight sequence!All in al the film is very slick, stylish, and colorful, laden with a good deal of flashy action sequences (wire work galore) and special effects, but hamstrung by poor performances, terrible dialog, and not a lot of substance.  By the way, I've got the `Unrated, Extended' version, which runs about six minutes longer than the theatrical release, but I seriously doubt anyone who only saw the original release is missing much as I doubt those six minutes included anything critical or even worthwhile to the actual film.  More or less labeling this the `Unrated, Extended' version was just an attempt by the studio to breathe new life in the aftermarket into a film that died in the box office.The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks very sharp and the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio comes through fine.  Skimpy extras include an uninteresting commentary track with Milla Jovovich by herself (where the heck is Wimmer?), a featurette titled UV Protection: The Making of Ultraviolet, and English subtitles.  Also thrown in are previews for other Sony DVD release including Final Fantasy: Advent Children (2005), Mirrormask (2005), Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School (2005), The Fog (2005), The Benchwarmers (2006), and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006).Cookieman108",2,"""Haven't you been paying attention?

E.g. bacteriophage.I can't help feel that 11 September has affected moviemaking in presenting commentary on the aftereffects of that tragedy.  In the case of Crash, it was ethnic relations.  Instead of the ""war on terrorism,"" there is a war against viruses and their carriers in Ultraviolet.  A mutated virus infects certain people who are called hemophages.  To maintain the health security of the people, special squads a scientific-oriented equivalent of Homeland Security under the leadership of the villainous Vice Cardinal Daxus, are sent to hunt down and exterminate the hemophages.  Daxus is a stereotypical smarmy cartoonish villain, who has a pair of plugs, or are those filters-through both nostrils.  And the presence of white plastic gloves and his unwrapping guns from sterilized packages make him the posterboy for bacteriophobia.  Interesting too is the shape of Daxus's headquarters, in a cross, like a cathedral, making germ-freedom into a kind of religion.Yet, a small resistance group has formed.  Among them is Violet, or V, a warrior with long jet black hair, glossy midriffed fetish suits of varying colours, a brace of machine guns that look more like staple guns, and a sword with some runes all over the blade.  They're very lethal, yet with the exception of some opponents on a rooftop, many of her opponents die without any blood.  And even without weapons, she is quite the martial artist a la Crouching Tiger.  V, herself once human, until the virus infecting her caused the death of her husband and unborn child-she was pregnant at the time-now hates humans, given how marginalized and persecuted hemophages are.Despite being called hemophages, the only thing remotely similar to vampires is the telltale fangs, which aren't for drinking Transylvanian tea.  Some characteristics of their mutations involve conjuring weapons from their bodies and a superior strength.Assigned by the leader of the hemophage underground leader, Nerva, to steal a secret weapon that if used, would kill all hemophages, and which, if not delivered on time, will self-destruct, V passes herself off as a courier.  When her cover's blown, she takes on several masked and heavily uniformed black and white-suited guards using her weapons.  Yet, when she discovers that the ""weapon"" is a child named Six, for a reason that becomes clear later in the film, some maternal instincts take over and she flees from Nerva and the rebels, Six in tow.  She has to avoid the hoards of Daxus's armed men, and fortunately gets help from Garth, a fellow hemophage and scientist.Despite the comic book style opening sequence, those into PS/2, XBOX style games, and not DC or Marvel Comics collectors, will probably be the biggest fans of this movie.  Watching the chase scene where V is pursued after leaving Daxus's headquarters, the peppered bulletholes, copters, shiny sides of skyscrapers all make Ultraviolet a video game on the big screen.  And there is a focus on aerial shots, where the however-many assailants surround V in a circle, only to be made digital mincemeat out of them, sometimes set to a pulsing techno score during the fighting or chase scenes, another dynamic of video games.  It's been mentioned along with Tron, itself an 80's movie that computerized its characters.  I'd also add the sci-fi/noir atmosphere of Bladerunner crossed with Minority Report as another comparing factor.Milla Jovovich's action films have a sci-fi bent to them-e.g. The Fifth Element and Resident Evil.  Here, she's a sci-fi guardian of a child, and it's not the acting but her glossy appearance and moves that are the heart of the movie.  So, despite the widespread panning by critics, what's my assessment?  If one concentrates more on its stylistic merits and Jovovich, rather than plot, then it's worth a look.  Those who automatically dismiss it as being another Matrix clone will probably not enjoy it.",3,PS/2 type style and Milla only assets in okay film,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,3967,"['Hemo-prefix', 'bloodPhage-suffix', 'something', 'E.g', 'bacteriophage.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', '11', 'September', 'affected', 'moviemaking', 'presenting', 'commentary', 'aftereffects', 'tragedy', 'case', 'Crash', 'was', 'ethnic', 'relations', 'Instead', 'war', 'terrorism', 'war', 'viruses', 'carriers', 'Ultraviolet', 'A', 'mutated', 'virus', 'infects', 'certain', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'called', 'hemophages', 'maintain', 'health', 'security', 'people', 'special', 'scientific-oriented', 'equivalent', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'leadership', 'villainous', 'Vice', 'Cardinal', 'Daxus', 'are', 'sent', 'hunt', 'down', 'exterminate', 'hemophages', 'Daxus', 'stereotypical', 'smarmy', 'cartoonish', 'villain', 'who', 'pair', 'plugs', 'are', 'filters-through', 'nostrils', 'presence', 'white', 'plastic', 'gloves', 'unwrapping', 'guns', 'sterilized', 'packages', 'make', 'posterboy', 'bacteriophobia', 'Interesting', 'too', 'shape', 'Daxus', 'headquarters', 'cross', 'cathedral', 'making', 'germ-freedom', 'kind', 'religion.Yet', 'small', 'resistance', 'group', 'formed', 'Violet', 'V', 'warrior', 'long', 'jet', 'black', 'hair', 'glossy', 'midriffed', 'fetish', 'suits', 'varying', 'colours', 'brace', 'machine', 'guns', 'look', 'more', 'like', 'staple', 'guns', 'sword', 'runes', 'blade', ""'re"", 'very', 'lethal', 'yet', 'exception', 'opponents', 'rooftop', 'many', 'opponents', 'die', 'blood', 'even', 'weapons', 'quite', 'martial', 'artist', 'la', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'V', 'once', 'human', 'virus', 'infecting', 'caused', 'death', 'husband', 'unborn', 'child-she', 'was', 'pregnant', 'time-now', 'hates', 'humans', 'given', 'how', 'marginalized', 'persecuted', 'hemophages', 'are.Despite', 'being', 'called', 'hemophages', 'only', 'thing', 'remotely', 'similar', 'vampires', 'telltale', 'fangs', 'are', ""n't"", 'drinking', 'Transylvanian', 'tea', 'characteristics', 'mutations', 'involve', 'conjuring', 'weapons', 'bodies', 'superior', 'strength.Assigned', 'leader', 'hemophage', 'underground', 'leader', 'Nerva', 'steal', 'secret', 'weapon', 'used', 'would', 'kill', 'hemophages', 'not', 'delivered', 'time', 'will', 'self-destruct', 'V', 'off', 'courier', 'When', 'cover', 'blown', 'several', 'masked', 'heavily', 'uniformed', 'black', 'white-suited', 'guards', 'using', 'weapons', 'when', 'weapon', 'child', 'named', 'Six', 'reason', 'clear', 'later', 'film', 'maternal', 'instincts', 'take', 'Nerva', 'rebels', 'Six', 'tow', 'avoid', 'hoards', 'Daxus', 'armed', 'men', 'fortunately', 'help', 'Garth', 'fellow', 'hemophage', 'scientist.Despite', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'opening', 'sequence', 'PS/2', 'XBOX', 'style', 'games', 'not', 'DC', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'collectors', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'biggest', 'fans', 'movie', 'Watching', 'chase', 'scene', 'where', 'V', 'pursued', 'leaving', 'Daxus', 'headquarters', 'peppered', 'bulletholes', 'copters', 'shiny', 'sides', 'skyscrapers', 'make', 'Ultraviolet', 'video', 'game', 'big', 'screen', 'focus', 'aerial', 'shots', 'where', 'however-many', 'assailants', 'surround', 'V', 'circle', 'only', 'be', 'made', 'digital', 'mincemeat', 'sometimes', 'set', 'pulsing', 'techno', 'score', 'fighting', 'chase', 'scenes', 'dynamic', 'video', 'games', 'been', 'mentioned', 'Tron', '80', 'movie', 'computerized', 'characters', ""'d"", 'also', 'add', 'sci-fi/noir', 'atmosphere', 'Bladerunner', 'crossed', 'Minority', 'Report', 'comparing', 'factor.Milla', 'Jovovich', 'action', 'films', 'have', 'sci-fi', 'bent', 'them-e.g', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Here', 'sci-fi', 'guardian', 'child', 'not', 'acting', 'glossy', 'appearance', 'moves', 'are', 'heart', 'movie', 'So', 'widespread', 'panning', 'critics', 'what', 'assessment', 'one', 'more', 'stylistic', 'merits', 'Jovovich', 'rather', 'plot', 'then', 'look', 'who', 'automatically', 'dismiss', 'being', 'Matrix', 'clone', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'enjoy']",N/A
989900,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000FGGE5Y,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","This is a pretty cool movie and all, but at some point you just have to pause and say, ""Huh?"" To borrow a phrase from the great and wise Ricky Ricardo, this movie has some 'splainin' to do. Heaven knows I love watching a young woman kick butt every which way from Sunday, and there's nothing sexier than the bare midriff look Milla Jovovich has going throughout this film, but -- and maybe I'm old-fashioned -- I sort of expect a movie to explain at least a few of its most unusual facets. For example, our heroine in this film can pull weapons out of thin air, make her hair and clothes change colors on a whim, and has no respect for the concept of gravity. All I know about her is that she was a normal human being who caught an engineered virus that turned her into a hemophage, died and was restored to life for further testing, and then escaped. I can buy into the whole heightened senses thing, but how this allows her to morph and avoid hails of bullets fired directly at her is quite beyond me. While I'm at it, let me also say that the central storyline has more cracks in it than, uh, something full of cracks. The ending is pure deus ex machina squared.The movie starts off great, though. I really liked the comic book montage style of the opening credits, and the film itself wastes no time in throwing Violet (Milla Jovovich) up against hordes of bad guys trying to kill her. The point of her initial, solo raid is to steal a new weapon the humans have designed, a weapon supposedly capable of wiping out Violet and all of her fellow hemophages. Said weapon turns out to be unlike anything you would expect, and Violet's decision to protect it rather than destroy it sets the stage for the remainder of the film. Her hemophage allies want the weapon either brought to them or destroyed, Vice Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus (Nick Chinlund), the weapon's creator and all-around power-hungry tyrant, wants it back, and Violet has to forge her own path through all this mess.Obviously, the filmmakers just wanted to show ninety minutes of Milla Jovovich doing what she does best, and the plot they threw together is really just a means to that end. The basic storyline is easy enough to follow, but far too many of its details go unexplained. As for the special effects and fight scenes, there's some really gnarly stuff on display here, but a lot of the CGI work is just overkill. Additionally, the cameramen are like kids with a new toy as they experiment with every angle known to man.Despite its inherent weaknesses, though, I really enjoyed the first hour or so of this film -- and then the novelty of all the fast and furious action wore off, leaving me to wade through another half hour of a pretty slippery and generally unimpressive story. Even the action goes downhill as the climax approaches, as too many of Violet's fights prove to be laughably easy ' and accompanied by incredibly clich&eacute; dialogue. The bottom line is this: Ultraviolet will definitely get your blood pumping, but it inevitably puts your brain cells on standby.",2,Maybe they should have finished the script before making the movie,1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,3051,"['pretty', 'cool', 'movie', 'point', 'just', 'have', 'pause', 'say', 'Huh', 'borrow', 'phrase', 'great', 'wise', 'Ricky', 'Ricardo', 'movie', ""'splainin"", 'do', 'Heaven', 'love', 'watching', 'young', 'woman', 'kick', 'butt', 'way', 'Sunday', 'nothing', 'sexier', 'bare', 'midriff', 'look', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'going', 'film', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'old-fashioned', 'sort', 'expect', 'movie', 'explain', 'least', 'few', 'most', 'unusual', 'facets', 'example', 'heroine', 'film', 'can', 'pull', 'weapons', 'thin', 'air', 'make', 'hair', 'clothes', 'change', 'colors', 'whim', 'respect', 'concept', 'gravity', 'know', 'was', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'caught', 'engineered', 'virus', 'turned', 'hemophage', 'died', 'was', 'restored', 'life', 'further', 'testing', 'then', 'escaped', 'can', 'buy', 'whole', 'heightened', 'senses', 'thing', 'how', 'morph', 'avoid', 'hails', 'bullets', 'fired', 'directly', 'quite', ""'m"", 'let', 'also', 'say', 'central', 'storyline', 'more', 'cracks', 'uh', 'something', 'full', 'cracks', 'ending', 'pure', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'squared.The', 'movie', 'great', 'really', 'liked', 'comic', 'book', 'montage', 'style', 'opening', 'credits', 'film', 'time', 'throwing', 'Violet', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'up', 'hordes', 'bad', 'guys', 'trying', 'kill', 'point', 'initial', 'solo', 'raid', 'steal', 'new', 'humans', 'have', 'designed', 'weapon', 'supposedly', 'capable', 'wiping', 'out', 'Violet', 'fellow', 'hemophages', 'Said', 'weapon', 'out', 'be', 'anything', 'would', 'expect', 'Violet', 'decision', 'protect', 'rather', 'destroy', 'stage', 'remainder', 'film', 'hemophage', 'allies', 'want', 'weapon', 'either', 'brought', 'destroyed', 'Vice', 'Cardinal', 'Ferdinand', 'Daxus', 'Nick', 'Chinlund', 'weapon', 'creator', 'all-around', 'power-hungry', 'tyrant', 'back', 'Violet', 'forge', 'own', 'path', 'mess.Obviously', 'filmmakers', 'just', 'wanted', 'show', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'plot', 'threw', 'together', 'really', 'just', 'means', 'end', 'basic', 'storyline', 'easy', 'enough', 'follow', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'go', 'unexplained', 'special', 'effects', 'fight', 'scenes', 'really', 'gnarly', 'stuff', 'display', 'here', 'lot', 'CGI', 'work', 'just', 'overkill', 'Additionally', 'cameramen', 'are', 'kids', 'new', 'toy', 'experiment', 'angle', 'known', 'man.Despite', 'inherent', 'weaknesses', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'film', 'then', 'novelty', 'fast', 'furious', 'action', 'wore', 'off', 'leaving', 'wade', 'half', 'hour', 'pretty', 'slippery', 'generally', 'unimpressive', 'story', 'Even', 'action', 'downhill', 'climax', 'approaches', 'too', 'many', 'Violet', 'fights', 'prove', 'be', 'laughably', 'easy', 'accompanied', 'incredibly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'dialogue', 'bottom', 'line', 'Ultraviolet', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'blood', 'pumping', 'inevitably', 'brain', 'cells', 'standby']",N/A

Having actually seen the film, I agree that there are too many fight sequences, to the point that you could be in a PS2 game. These sequences are at times too drawn out and some become predictable and tedious....Also the plot could have been better developed too.So what is good about the film?Set in the future, the world is in the midst of a war between humans and people infected with a vampire like virus which gives them superhuman skills.Milla Jovovich is actually quite good in the ambiguous lead role. She has fled the laboratory that infected her with the Hemomphage virus which resulted in the death of her unborn child. Now embittered and angry with Humanity, she has become a lethal assassin for the Hemophage movement.However, her stance is turned upside down when she encounters a laboratory bred, nine year old boy. Well played by Cameron Bright, he is a vessel for a virus that could threaten Hemophages or Humanity. Both sides want to get hold of him. In scenes reminiscent of John Cassavates 'Gloria', this boy's plight cuts through Ultraviolet's cynical exterior and awakens her maternal instincts, and she goes on the run with him, trying to protect him from her fellow Hemophages and the security forces of Humanity's dictator.She and Bright develop a convincing and sympathetic relationship while on the run, and just like Gloria, this enhances and underscores the moments of danger and perilThe sets are superb and give the film real atmosphere at times, I believe that Shanghai was largely used as the location.See the film for what it is - undemanding but entertaining Sci Fi.",3,Undemanding  but entertaining Sci Fi,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,1680,"['subject', 'very', 'bad', 'reviews', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'keen', 'see', 'film', 'Having', 'actually', 'seen', 'film', 'agree', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'fight', 'sequences', 'point', 'could', 'be', 'PS2', 'game', 'sequences', 'are', 'times', 'too', 'drawn', 'out', 'become', 'predictable', 'tedious', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'developed', 'too.So', 'what', 'good', 'film', 'Set', 'future', 'world', 'midst', 'war', 'humans', 'people', 'infected', 'vampire', 'virus', 'superhuman', 'skills.Milla', 'Jovovich', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'ambiguous', 'lead', 'role', 'fled', 'laboratory', 'infected', 'Hemomphage', 'virus', 'resulted', 'death', 'unborn', 'child', 'Now', 'embittered', 'angry', 'Humanity', 'become', 'lethal', 'assassin', 'Hemophage', 'movement.However', 'stance', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'laboratory', 'bred', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'Well', 'played', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'vessel', 'virus', 'could', 'threaten', 'Hemophages', 'Humanity', 'sides', 'want', 'get', 'hold', 'scenes', 'reminiscent', 'John', 'Cassavates', ""'Gloria"", 'boy', 'plight', 'cuts', 'Ultraviolet', 'cynical', 'exterior', 'maternal', 'instincts', 'run', 'trying', 'protect', 'fellow', 'Hemophages', 'security', 'forces', 'Humanity', 'dictator.She', 'Bright', 'develop', 'convincing', 'sympathetic', 'relationship', 'run', 'just', 'Gloria', 'enhances', 'moments', 'danger', 'perilThe', 'sets', 'are', 'superb', 'give', 'film', 'real', 'atmosphere', 'times', 'believe', 'Shanghai', 'was', 'largely', 'used', 'location.See', 'film', 'what', 'undemanding', 'entertaining', 'Sci', 'Fi']",N/A

All kidding aside, she is quite stunning to look at.The plot -- not that one matters! -- is inconsequential here.  All the film is shuttles between excuses to get from each action set piece to the next compliments of plenty of obvious CGI.  Don't get me wrong!  When it's action, it's quite pretty ... arguably as pretty as is the film's lead.  It's Milla fighting, Milla shooting, Milla on a motorcycle, Milla swinging a samurai sword ... so many bodies, so little time (7 minutes longer than the theatrical cut for those of you keeping track).In a film where the science is largely unexplained and sacrificed to the world of magic (Violet has a mystical belt buckle that not only allows her to ignore the law of gravity but also anything she's riding, too!), what matters is that it all look pretty, and, on that level, I guess it's safe to conclude that the package is delivered.

Clearly there were relationships that had no connection to the rest of the story.  The head bad guy, Vice Cardinal Daxus was... well, a cartoon overstatement of a bad politician.

I'll start by saying what I DID like. There were some decent moments of music, and there were some nice-looking gadgets here and there. And.....that's it. The rest of Ultraviolet is pure trash from beginning to end. Here's why:-The CGI effects in this movie is appallingly bad. During about 90% percent of the time I was watching this movie, I was annoyed at how unrealistic the chase sequences, the buildings (both inside and outside), and the flying bullets looked. You can really tell when and where they used green screens and.-Every single character in this movie is never interesting and never intriguing. The kid character is a bore. The hemophage rebels are weak and completely forgettable. The main villain, a cardboard cutout at best, does not look dangerous in any way (one reason being a terrible casting choice). And finally, the hero named Violet is dull and unconvincing. Even when she feels conflicted, there is no real sense of dilemma that's conveyed onscreen. It seems more like a stupid excuse for plot progression.-Nearly everybody in the film does a horrid job at acting, especially Milla Jovovich as Violet & Sebastien Andrieu as Nerva. The sole exception is William Fichtner as Garth, who looks like he at least put some effort in his performance.-The dialogue is amazing, but in a very bad way. ""You are all gonna die."" I'm sorry, what?-Why are the colors in this movie so bright and disjointed? I think I'm having Batman & Robin flashbacks!-The fight sequences are some of the worst that I have ever seen. It's completely tedious, because the main character (Violet) doesn't get hit even once by a bullet nor a sword. She doesn't even get hurt when she crashes into a high-rise building with her motorcycle. There is no real sense of jeopardy, which really ruins any opportunity to create any suspense. In the end, once you've seen how she deals with literally dozens of soldiers, you'll know exactly how the end fight between the hero and the villain turns out.-There are several plot twists in this film, and NONE of them are shocking. Why? Because by this time, there is absolutely nothing in the story that fascinates me in any way.-One of the most overused and most notorious plot points is used in this movie.

There are so many flaws in this movie that I lost count halfway through. It doesn't even pass as a guilty pleasure; that's how bad this movie is.

I thought it was very inventive and unique.  I'm so sick of people bringing up past movies and comparing new movies to them.  How many more million times must people compare movies to The Matrix?!  Can't people remember farther back than that?  I mean come on people, get some perspective on movies.Ultraviolet is an awesome movie in and of itself.  Great story, great execution.  Some of the CGI isn't up to the standards of a lot of the high budget movies today, but it doesn't take away from the movie at all.  The sets are very inventive and colorful.  Like Equilibrium before it, Ultraviolet gets an A+ for style and execution.  The fight scenes are very pleasing.  The gun kata scenes (see Equilibrium) are great.  I went into this movie expecting much worse.  By the end of the movie I must say I was very pleased with the experience and find many bad reviews unwarranted.  I think Ultraviolet is destined to become a cult classic along the same vein as Equilibrium has.I think people need to seek more out of a movie on its own merits rather than comparing it to something else (*cough* Matrix *cough).  I think people have become spoiled and are easily disappointed if a movie doesn't up the bar another notch.  Movies are entertainment, not benchmarks.  Ultraviolet is a movie about a comic book character and world.  It immerses you into that world and makes you feel for the characters.  It has great special effects and more style than many movies could ever hope to have.  I believe this movie deserves way more than people are giving it.  So with that I'm giving it 5 stars to help counterbalance the posers.  And yes, I truly believe it deserves 5 stars.You can agree to disagree, but I challenge you to watch the movie without trying to compare it to something else.

However, it should be noted that it's one of those movies where about half of the plot is backstory, and is only revealed one part at a time as those parts become relevant to the here-and-now. I'll admit that it seems to have quite a lot in common with the somewhat superior V for Vendetta, but with the addition of the whole pathogen-induced-monster thing that has become quite the fashion these days (28 days later, Doom, Resident Evil, etc.), though at least this time it's vampires instead of zombies :)But yeah, this is a movie that will continuously tickle your brain as small details from earlier in the movie end up having critical importance later. The bad guy turns out to be more than we are initially led to believe. Enough is revealed about Violet to get the audience to sympathize with her (at least as much as Aliens and Terminator got their audiences to sympathize with Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor). The movie makes VERY good use of fictional technologies, especially dimensional compression or flat space or whatever it's called.Speaking of which, FLAMING SWORDFIGHT IN THE DARK!!!

989939,A24I3BMB9JZC7O,B000FGGE5Y,"Ingrid Heyn ""No man is an Iland, intire of it...","[0, 0]","You know, had this film had a better scriptwriter, who didn't simply repeat bad comic or game lines for the characters but created taut, snappy dialogue and more complex interplay, this could have been a superb film.The look of it is extremely interesting. The use of Shanghai for the city of the future was marvellous, and I enjoyed the comic-ised  palette and the use of CGI to recreate the graphic novel/game appearance. The martial arts style was fascinating, and Milla Jovovich is certainly stunning.But character depth, interplay and plot have been discarded as unimportant in this movie. None of the characters has anything interesting to say - it's all very much ""this is a computer game and no one expects Shakespeare""-style dialogue. The motivations of the characters are often inexplicable. The actual danger of this disease of the haemophages is never explained. How the boy (named Six - a clone of a cartoon-style villain) is supposed to be activated to act as a weapon is never explained. The motivation for the villain is frankly ludicrous. And the endless and inevitable and unstoppable killing routine of Violet herself is fun, but let's face it - ridiculous.One has to suspend disbelief to enjoy the film. I did so willingly - but even so, the plot problems were gaping. I think it's time that directors of this style of movie stopped thinking viewers will not notice the plot problems and lack of depth in the characters. Yes, no doubt it's fun for a director to bring a comic book to life, but really, really, REALLY... directors and scriptwriters have got to get beyond the ""oh, isn't it fun - we're creating dialogue just like a comic book!"" stage. It isn't fun for the audience. There is a difference between comic books and films, and part of the difference is in the expectation of the dialogue and the richness of characters.By all means, let the look of this style of film continue to utilise the stark and bright colours of the graphic novel/game. But the stereotypical characters are far too obvious when transported from comic book to screen. FAR too obvious. Detailed work needs to be done by a real scriptwriter who doesn't mind creating more realistic characters with deeper functionality than a mere imitation of their comic book counterpart.The crew obviously enjoyed working on this film, particularly with all the special effects. They clearly did not think in terms of a great plot, but in terms of ""wow, we have a fantastic motorcycle sequence going along the SIDE of buildings!"" or ""wow, we have Violet fighting twenty armoured men!"" or ""wow, doesn't Milla look beautiful in these shots?"" and so on. Mm-hmm. Ho hum, I'm afraid. These sequences are simply UNIMPORTANT to making the film itself great. They don't do it. They cannot and never will take the place of a truly good plot.So many things didn't make sense. Why was Six thought to be dead if he wasn't? Why did Violet's teardrop make him not dead? Why did she know this? Why did she risk her life for him when, for all she knew, merely touching the boy would result in instant annihilation of all her people? Why did she keep keep spouting appallingly bad lines about how dangerous and deadly a killer she is? (This struck such a jarring note...) Why was she able to fool all the tests when she was pretending to a courier? How did she slaughter all of the guards she confronted, even when overcome by completely overwhelming odds? (In true comic-book style, she was supposed to be invincible, but the scriptwriter and director were clearly trying to make Violet ""real""... They've forgotten ""real"" only works when overwhelming odds aren't included all the time in a completely unrealistic way.)I do think the casting of Milla Jovovich was right for the role, and she's a good actress. She did the best she could with this role. The fault was in the writing.In these terms, ""Ultraviolet"" was a disappointment. ""Equilibrium"", also a fantasy film with a super-hero type of character, was amazingly good, and featured not only a powerhouse performance from Christian Bale, but had a story that made sense. It had character dynamics that were superb. It also had an incredibly moving moment - that instant when Bale's character hears the music of Beethoven for the first time while no longer on his emotion-suppressing medication, and tears of astonishment and wonder at the beauty of it trickle from his eyes. Now THAT worked...I hope the director of this film will tackle that sort of film again, and will choose a scriptwriter who can create emotionally powerful moments like that, as well as create characters that have real depth, not pseudo-depth as I'm afraid the character of Ultraviolet had.Recommended with caveats, mainly for the look of it, and for those who enjoy the sight of an unstoppable but unrealistic woman defeating anyone who comes against her or stands in her way. Do not watch if you want a genuinely gripping plot or believable characters.",3,Four for the look and idea of it - but concepts of plot have been jettisoned,1156118400,"08 21,

Ultraviolet is a movie with a real plot, set in a realistic projected future and with real characterizations, a movie with real music, real acting, a simple plot yet with many convolutions.Visually the CGI of Ultraviolet somehow makes it more ""real"" than the staged and overly fussed unrealistic Aeon Flux stagings.  Mila Jovavich brings a focused, intense performance in which both rage and emotional sensitivity lurk just beneath the surface of her enhanced but time limited precarious existence.The movie will need to be seen several times but the underlying theme of resistance against future political repression, in the form of a symbolized fantasy, and objectified and concretized from that abstraction by the forcefullness and precision of Jovavich's fine acting, all add up to a movie which has become an unexpected gem on a beach strewn with rubble like Flux.  Jovavich is the troubled heroine, transcending her own limitations to attain her goals, with or without the help of anyone, a heroine of the future in a world which, like that of today, is maintained by forces which seek to dehumanize us all as human ""resources"" and genetic types.I am certain there are some who will disagree violently with my review.

The buildings and other CGI effects would be ok back when Tron was made but now look like refugees from a Final Cut Pro workshop. Can you say fake? And since this chop-socky film needs good CGI to even make it somewhat believable the grade z computer work cripples this film right out of the box.And make no mistake this is a pure chop-socky film, but unfortunately we only have Ms Milla to chop and kick, nary a Jet Lei or Jacky Chan or Gordon Lee to be found.  As a matter of fact every other actor here looks like D-list material here at best.And Talking D-list lets talk about the choreography here. Chop socky films do have a certain flow to the fights at least the good ones do. Unfortunately the fight scenes here are all paint-by-numbers affairs. Not only that, they feel like the same fight scene.  And derivative  fight pieces are slow death for an action film like this one.What is to like here? Well in better hands the Si Fi premise definitely has legs.  What would a society look like if we became obsessed with disease, an AIDS like disease that was not so limited and much more virulent?  Where would we draw the line on ""experimentation""?  What rights would we give up on to be ""safe?""

Norlin ""lkgemini""","[1, 1]","Imagine taking the acting power of Christian Bale, Emily Watson, Taye Diggs, and Sean Bean (from Equilibrium), and hoping that Milla Jovovich can pull the weight of that ensemble.  You should know that your movie is already in trouble.  Kurt Wimmer's previous pictue, Equlibrium, had great acting, intense scenes, strong drama, all mixed in with creative action scenes.  Ultraviolet drops all those elements except for the creative actions scenes which never seem to end or really have much of a point.  (If you do like this film, check out Versus which is much the same way.)Rumor has it that the director/writer lost final control over this film.  This can been seen in the fact that he contributes nothing to the DVD.  In the making of featurettes, Wimmer is refered to glowingly by the actors, producers, and various crew.

Somewhat confusing in parts, the movie has an interesting basic idea - a highly contagious virus set loose on the population - those infected become stronger, faster, get night vision (and light sensitivity), get longer ""vampirish"" teeth, but only live 12 years from infection.  The government rounds up those who are infected (called ""hemophages"") into internment centers and experiment on them.  Soon there is a resistance movement and ""Blood Wars"".  That's where we find Violet, a hemophage who is transporting a secret weapon stolen from the humans.The action is over-the-top violence with excellent (and sometimes bizarrely unnecessary) special effects.  Violet consistently defeats hoardes of opponents, usually armed, with her variety of guns, swords, and fighting skills.This movie was a fun watch for a rainy Sunday afternoon.

Cameron Bright also did a good job in his role. In this film I'm going to hold the director entirely responsible for bringing together this mess. `Ultraviolet' is something that I'd expect from Uwe Boll. The film relies completely on CGI and still manages to fall short of expectations. The movie bears some resemblance to `Equilibrium,' like the art of the Gun-Kata and how society is stratified. If you haven't seen `Equilibrium,' you must. It is Kurt Wimmer's greatest movie of all time.On this film Wimmer thought that the pretty colors are supposed to distract us from the incoherent script? It didn't work on this film. `The Sky Captain'-style post-processing just makes everything look blurry. (And why is it applied to only half the shots?) Just about everything in this movie is borrowed from something else, and it's slapped together on the thinnest of premises and tarted up with lots of CGI. When there's a break from the ridiculously-choreographed action sequences, you're bludgeoned with nonsensical subplots and indescribably awful dialogue until the heroine met the villain in their final showdown.Anyways, I think that there is no justification in watching this film, spare yourself the pain and re-watch `The Fifth Element' or any one of the ""Resident Evil's"" instead.",2,Even though I've been warned I still went ahead and watch this.....go me.,1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,1396,"['Personally', 'believe', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'great', 'even', ""'tough"", 'role', 'really', 'well', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'film', ""'m"", 'going', 'hold', 'director', 'entirely', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'together', 'mess', 'Ultraviolet', 'something', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'film', 'completely', 'CGI', 'still', 'fall', 'short', 'expectations', 'movie', 'resemblance', 'Equilibrium', 'art', 'Gun-Kata', 'how', 'society', 'stratified', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Equilibrium', 'must', 'Kurt', 'Wimmer', 'greatest', 'movie', 'time.On', 'film', 'Wimmer', 'thought', 'pretty', 'colors', 'are', 'supposed', 'distract', 'incoherent', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'Sky', ""Captain'-style"", 'post-processing', 'just', 'everything', 'look', 'blurry', 'why', 'applied', 'only', 'shots', 'Just', 'everything', 'movie', 'borrowed', 'something', 'else', 'slapped', 'together', 'thinnest', 'premises', 'tarted', 'up', 'lots', 'CGI', 'When', 'break', 'ridiculously-choreographed', 'action', 'sequences', ""'re"", 'bludgeoned', 'nonsensical', 'subplots', 'indescribably', 'awful', 'dialogue', 'heroine', 'met', 'villain', 'final', 'showdown.Anyways', 'think', 'justification', 'watching', 'film', 'spare', 'pain', 're-watch', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'one', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'instead']",N/A

This type of thinking only shows just how far someone would stretch something just to make an argument. A ridiculous, unfounded argument that further fuels what so many people think of christianity today. That its nothing but a group of bored, lifeless people who need to pick apart anything and everything to give themselves some sort of voice or meaning, to give themselves something to defend when its clearly only one sided. Those people are what gives christianity a bad name. No, I don't think this film is anti-christian. The thought never even crossed my mind. (No pun intended) I highly doubt the writer/director was trying to offend christians as much as he was trying to bring a bit of the ""vampiric"" look and feel to the movie. Some people need to question their priorities and start fighting against more important things instead of a movie.As for my review, I found the movie to be enjoyable, not nearly as horrible as I've heard.

Add to this concoction a beautiful hemophage called Violet , Milla Jovovich in her scantily dressed best whose fighting skills are legendary, a megalomaniac leader with a deadly secret, a human child known as Six whose very body is a weapon and who brings out the maternal instinct in Violet and a gentle but scientifically gifted hemophage played by the delectable William Fichtner who loves Violet and will do anything to save her.The movie is non stop action from beginning to end, and is quite amusing in parts too, like when one of the Vampires warn Violet that they are as fast and as strong as she is, but she points out that she is far more pissed off than they are, not only that but her maternal ire is up and she will do anything she can to save Six a child who is slowly dying from whatever has been added to his blood but with whom she shares a bond of loss, pain, sorrow and possible redemption.Despite the critics and reviewers panning this movie I give it a quality five out of five based on a high enjoyment factor of the fight scenes, the scenery, the drop dead gorgeous costumes that Violet gets to wear, the state of the art special effects and the quirky dialogue.I wish I had seen it on the big screen though, it must have been a sight to behold!",5,"Ultraviolet, ultrafast, ultrafun!",1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,1840,"['actually', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'wary', 'about', 'watching', 'was', 'panned', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'fabulous', 'fight', 'sequences', 'reasonably', 'good', 'plot', 'yet', 'perhaps', 'could', 'do', 'bit', 'tightening', 'up', 'was', 'worth', 'watching.Take', 'future', 'city', 'filled', 'humans', 'Vampires', 'only', 'are', ""n't"", 'called', 'Vampires', 'are', 'known', 'hemophages', 'are', 'faster', 'stronger', 'average', 'human', 'are', 'also', 'hated', 'feared', 'humans', 'have', 'been', 'hunted', 'extinction', 'Add', 'concoction', 'beautiful', 'hemophage', 'called', 'Violet', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'scantily', 'dressed', 'best', 'fighting', 'skills', 'are', 'legendary', 'megalomaniac', 'leader', 'deadly', 'secret', 'human', 'child', 'known', 'Six', 'very', 'body', 'weapon', 'who', 'out', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'Violet', 'gentle', 'scientifically', 'gifted', 'hemophage', 'played', 'delectable', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'who', 'Violet', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'save', 'her.The', 'movie', 'non', 'stop', 'action', 'beginning', 'end', 'quite', 'amusing', 'parts', 'too', 'when', 'one', 'Vampires', 'warn', 'Violet', 'are', 'fast', 'as', 'strong', 'out', 'far', 'more', 'pissed', 'off', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'maternal', 'ire', 'up', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'can', 'save', 'Six', 'child', 'who', 'slowly', 'dying', 'been', 'added', 'blood', 'whom', 'shares', 'bond', 'loss', 'pain', 'sorrow', 'possible', 'redemption.Despite', 'critics', 'reviewers', 'panning', 'movie', 'give', 'quality', 'five', 'five', 'based', 'high', 'enjoyment', 'factor', 'fight', 'scenes', 'scenery', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'Violet', 'wear', 'state', 'art', 'special', 'effects', 'quirky', 'dialogue.I', 'wish', 'had', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'sight', 'behold']",N/A

In books I expect the story to stir up the images but in movies it's the visuals that rock my world, and the story follows closely behind.This movie surely had my eyes  and my mind captivated from start to finish. The story as far fetched as it was didn't throw me off, as I followed Violet, played by Milla Jovovich who in my mind was born to play quirky high combat characters, and her team of friends and foes as the so called, Blood Wars fed life cycles of modern Earth. She  is on a  mission which  I will not give away, but  that  mission makes her angry,  unstoppable and out for blood as she flew, drove , kicked, shot, sliced though and propelled herself again st laws of gravity towards her goal. The colors, liquid metallics, flying  scraps of matter,  bullets, heart stopping stunts and  her motorbike skills left me with my  mouth open and my brain entertained in a way that  is hard for most movies.  I have never seen the Ultraviolet comics but this movie was swimming in special effects so collaborative that all fantastic movies now have more to struggle against as this set new standards .I know I  might have more unusual liking for movies than the majority, and as many people didn't seem to like it, I have to  say that this was wonderful and intense  beyond what I expected. The music by Klaus  Badelt was just as magnificent  and will have to go on top of my movie scores list.

989963,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000FGGE5Y,K. Driscoll,"[7, 9]","Technology in video games is consistently making an effort to look more realistic to game players.  Ultraviolet is a motion picture that seemingly makes an effort to look more like a video game.  I'm sort of indifferent to that direction I suppose, but it's a point I still think is important to make.  Ultraviolet is visually unique and the pace of the film doesn't quit.  You can tell that director Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium) doesn't really want us to believe any of this is real as he is striving to create a dystopian world that would exist otherwise only within a comic book or Japanese animation. Ultraviolet does indeed require a vast imagination, but for some of us that's not such a bad thing.Ultraviolet is a chase movie about Violet (Milla Jovovich) who, among many others in her time (in the late 21st century), is infected with a virus that gives her super human powers.  Violet is part of an underground terrorist group that exists to fight against the resident dictatorship.  Soon enough, Violet steals a child (Cameron Bright) from the government and finds out he may be the cure to this disease that allows her to be invincible and be really good at driving a motorcycle.  The terrorist group she is in with decides the child must die and so Violet begins running from everyone with the child.  With some more twists and turns Ultraviolet leads up to a formulaic showdown and more dramatic and unrealistic fight scenes than you could possible imagine.Ultraviolet is an excessive mess.  The fight scenes are perplexing and miserable to watch, not to mention completely unrealistic, which is something I can almost forgive.  Ultraviolet is the ultimate example of over-stylized filmmaking.  In the action genre, the viewer should probably never be aware that a fight scene is choreographed while viewing it, but if a fine line exists between dancing and fighting then Ultraviolet is balancing very carefully upon it and it is doing so right next to Joel Schumacher'sBatman & Robin.  The story also seemed jumbled and confusing.  I really wasn't sure what was happening until the very end and even then I had some questions that I wasn't even motivated to have answered.  The dialogue was delivered stoically and isn't very good to begin with.  The music was as distracting as the visuals.  Other than that it was a visually original film and I guess that is where it earns a star for me.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[11, 15]","When Kurt Wimmer wrote and directed ""Equilibrium,"" he managed to make a wonderful, lower-budget sci-fi flick that had a great story, plenty of action, and solid performances from actors such as the wonderful Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs, and Emily Watson.  When Wimmer cranked out ""Ultraviolet,"" he was given a larger budget, an established action star in Milla Jovovich, and a really creepy kid who is perfect at playing a creepy kid (Cameron Bright).  So what does he do with these seemingly win-win elements?  He goes heavy, VERY heavy, on the action, heavy on the CGI, and tosses the actual acting performances to the wayside.Jovovich, Bright, and underrated character actor William Fichtner (also of ""Equilibrium""), have absolutely nothing to work with in this story.  The reed-thin plot is based around Violet (Jovovich), a hemophage who's out to capture a weapon that can supposedly eliminate her kind on Earth.  It seems that every disease in the universe has been wiped out except for one that makes its victims look and act like vampires.  After capturing the weapon, however, Violet begins to question the motives of both her allies and her enemies and all of it sort of smashes along at breakneck speed until there is no one left to kill on the screen.This film wreaks of echoes of ""Equilibrium.""  From the armed soldiers who explode into powdery shards to the clean white uniforms worn by Violet and others in the flick, it seems as if Wimmer took what he felt were the coolest parts of his cult hit and threw it into this film hoping to cash in on it once again.  Even the gun-kata is tossed in!Visually, this is like a video game gone awry.  There's enough eye candy here to send you into fits.  Bright colors everywhere, chameleon-like outfit changes by Violet, and weapons that appear out of the air.  Wimmer unloaded his bag of visual tricks on this one.There is plenty of action here.

989971,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FGGE5Y,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 6]","Early on in ""Ultraviolet"" there is a section of exposition that goes on and on, and I knew right then and there that this 2006 film written and directed by Kurt Wimmer (""Equilibrium""), was in big trouble. When you get to the point where you feel you need to be taking notes, it is just not a good sign. Not that the situation is all that confusing, to wit: in the future the human race is divided into normal humans and the Hemophages, who have a blood disease that makes them like vampires. Actually, it is more like they are called vampires, but if you are looking for this to matter in some significant way you will be disappointed. Incisors grow a bit longer and Violet Song ja Shariff (Milla Jovovich) comes back from the dead without exactly rising from the grave, and that is about it.Violet is sent off by her side to destroy a secret weapon which is in a case that she is repeatedly and emphatically told not to open, thereby guaranteeing that she will open it, not destroy it, and put herself in the middle of everything so that everybody will want to see her dead. Vicecardinum Ferdinand Daxus (Nick Chinlund) is the main villain, which means that when he and Violet finally get around to fighting with flaming swords we are just about at the end of the film. In between she basically kills everybody who tries to stop her from whatever she happens to be doing. Most of the action is decidedly uninspiring, but there are a few quick bits that will shake you from you lethargy and give you a brief moment of hope that things are looking up for this film.In terms of what category ""Ultraviolet"" ends up in, I would say that is definitely more of a comic book movie than a computer game movie. At first I thought it was obviously trying to be the latter, but there are just way too many shots and scenes that are clearly in keeping with the comic book approach to seeing the universe. Besides, the fight sequences with Violet usually tend to be quick and to the point, which is not the point of dispatching people in most computer games. If anything the violence is in keeping with Asian cinema. . The one thing I am sure of is that this film does not come close to taking from the best of any of these schools of influence. It has been a long time since I have been so easily bored by a science fiction film.

989987,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B000FGGE5Y,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[5, 8]","The 2006 film ""Ultraviolet"", which was written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, portrays the story of a female vampire named Violet (Milla Jovovich, who may be best remembered for her portrayal of the character Leeloo in the 1997 sci-fi film ""The Fifth Element""), who, with other vampires (or as they are called in the film, hemophages), fight government & corporate agents who are determined to destroy them.  The surreal futuristic world of ""Ultraviolet"" is one in which many people have been infected by a disease that transforms them into hemophages.  Those that are not infected wear large amounts of protective rubber clothing and gas masks (especially soldiers, whose faces are never seen) to avoid being infected.  The point of this film?  Daxus (Nick Chinlund), a seemingly uninfected human in charge, creates clones of himself with which he hopes to destroy the hemophages.  One of the clones, a boy named Six (Cameron Bright), is captured by violet; but instead of destroying him as the other hemophages want her to do, Violet befriends & protects the boy.  Hence, most of this comic-book-like film involves unrealistic martial-arts fighting, lots of weapons, motorcycles, protective gear, an evil corporate boss, an innocent boy and a woman (Violet) who can't decide what hair color she wants as it periodically changes.If you were looking for good acting, an interesting story, well-written dialog, engaging characters and an entertaining sci-fi film, chances are rather high that you won't find any of that in the film ""Ultraviolet"".

The spiritual successor to The Matrix, Equilibrium had the perfect mix of cinematography, pathos, and action that has rarely been equaled. And the first thing I thought when watching Ultraviolet was...""Wow, this is a terrible imitation of Equilibrium.""Equilibrium used its special effects sparingly, cutting away when appropriate, zooming in when necessary, and always remaining focused on relationships despite the nihilistic setting. To my surprise, Kurt Wimmer, director of Equilibrium, also directed Ultraviolet.  Something clearly went horribly awry.The parallels between the two films are striking.  The fabled Gun Kata - a martial art using pistols - is clearly in evidence in Ultraviolet. The same dystopian future plagues humanity, only instead of emotion the authorities suppress hemophages (a cute term for vampires). And just like in Equilibrium, the main character's relationship with children is at the crux of her redemption. And yet Equilibrium is superior to this film in every way.Buried somewhere in Ultraviolet is a parable about fear, misplaced trust, and abuse of authority - all the same themes explored in Equilibrium. The special effects are generally above par, the combat scenes impeccable, and Mila Jovovich (as Violet) is as deadly sleek as ever. But when the CGI clearly doesn't hold up, the camera never looks away.  When combat scenes should be beautiful they become blurry jump-cuts of confusion.  When Violet gets mad, instead of a cold killing machine she comes off as a mumbling thug. Aeon Flux she ain't.Ultraviolet has high ambitions for its comic book ""Japanimation"" aesthetic, but it fails by simply being all violence all the time. Equilibrium had a similar premise but it pulsed with love, sorrow, and rage.  Conversely, Ultraviolet has the emotion dial set to angry and keeps it there.

White ""impossiblefunky""","[0, 4]","In the second LONE WOLF & CUB film (KOZURE KAMI: SANZU NO KAWA NO UBAGURUMA), a wounded Ogami Itto (Tomisaburo Wakayama) confronts his enemies at a well.  Bound and hanging over its mouth is his son, Daigoro (Akihiro Tomikawa).  The boy kicks off a sandal, sending it plummeting into the inky darkness below.  Ogami measures the seconds until he hears the gentle ""plop"" of the sandal meeting the deep water before beginning the obliteration of his foes.  Engaged in combat, the man who held Daigoro's rope allows the boy to fall.  Ogami slices his way through the group to grab the rope in time to save his son.A well in 1800s rural Japan makes sense.  A well in a church ""somewhere in the future"" doesn't.  Yet, that's par for the course with ULTRAVIOLET, a quasi-vampire action film from writer/director Kurt Wimmer.

989996,A34X9EZTTQR7R7,B000FGGE5Y,"MK ""Hussar""","[2, 3]","If there is genius here, it must reside in the ultraviolet spectrum, for this fool's eyes can't see it.  Perhaps writer/director Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium, Sphere) thought it was sufficient to wrap ideas from past successes around the scaffolding of this movie's comic-book foundation.  However, this structure will not last eons, and probably will crumble from the minds of most audience members the minute ""End"" is registered by their photoreceptors.In the recent past, a bioweapons lab, seeking to modify the DNA of a known virus for military application, instead accidentally makes the pathogen infinitely more virulent than it was before.  Far from causing a few sniffles, this new bug escapes the facility via rapid transmission and replication, and speeds along Homo sapiens evolution by a couple of hundred millennia of so, facilitating the emergence of the Hemophages.  The government seeks to contain the ""plague,"" and collects those who are contagious, sending them to concentration-camp-like isolation zones.  When it is discovered that these collected persons are never heard from again, the Hemophages organize for their very survival.  Although they have superhuman powers of lightning speed and great strength, the Hemophages seem incapable in making inroads against their oppressors:  they require a secret weapon of their own.Seemingly doomed to the role of fighting-vixen for all time, Milla Jovovich again dons the Lycra-impregnated jumpsuit to fiercely impart justice to any random redshirt who tumbles her way.  Violet (Milla) is the ultimate infiltrator of the Hemophages.  This group of pseudo-vampires has banded together to elude the hygiene-obsessed Daxus (Nick Chinlund).  In principle, this seems simple--unfortunately, Daxus acts as despot over an army of gasmask-wearing, Uzi-toting thugs who seems singularly incapable of doing any actual fighting.  The film opens with Violet piercing the security systems of Daxus' main laboratory.  She successfully poses as a courier, enduring bone, retinal, DNA, blood, and voice-scans before being allowed full access to the package she has been ""hired"" to deliver.  The real security-courier arrives seconds after the package has been delivered into Violet's gloved hand, triggering klaxons, low-level minion attacks, and an escape sequence which, quite literally, defies gravity.Following countless action sequences--during which the viewer neither believes not cares that Violet's life is in any real danger--it is revealed that the ""weapon"" is really a young boy who acts as host for a virus capable of eradicating all Hemophages.  Trapped in an extra-dimensional space inside the package, Six (Cameron Bright) soon whisks away Violet's common sense with one or two pouty expressions, requiring her to also find refuges from her previous kin.There are an abundance of new and borrowed science-fiction ideas secreted away in this mess of a movie--a pity because a better story may have implemented them more interestingly, and more cohesively.  The extra-dimensional storage space is capable of holding near-infinite quantities of weapons, ammunition, boys, etc.  The sanitation-themed society bears similarity to the real world of yesterday, in regards to the maniacal devotion to facial-handkerchief implementation seen in individuals who succumbed to fear of the SARS virus.  Super-powerful ninja-vampires suggest a ""Blade""-like influence.However, no amount of special ideas could have saved this movie from being, at best, fluff.  The dialogue is atrocious, with endless pseudo-philosophical ruminations which remind us of the more easily-forgotten ""deep"" conversations we all thought we had in college.  The plot is intricate in a maddeningly unimportant way, as I simply didn't care to puzzle the whole thing out.  The action is absolutely unbelievable, horribly edited, and 100% bloodless--a bit of gore could have at least appeased the viewer's inner voyeur.  Inside, we get sterile, uninteresting, and repetitive ""gun-blade"" fighting (guns are used as projectile and melee weapons).  This movie is like ""Equilibrium"" under the influence of a fistful of diazepam, with a couple ounces of any given hallucinogen thrown in for good measure.Chinlund is an excellent actor who steals every scene he's in--as the noseplug-wearing Daxus, he is suitably over-the-top and quite entertaining.  Jovovich is eye-candy for those favoring females of Kievan Rus extraction, and little more.  Bright is believable as a doomed boy-weapon thrown into a titanic struggle where he is only a pawn.  He is also less creepy than he was in previous roles, but only by a hair.""Ultraviolet"" is recommended for those bed-bound, who are also fortunate enough to be accompanied by several good mates and a smattering of potent beverages.  To summarize, this is a perfect drinking-game movie.  Drink once for every ten vanquished enemies, twice for every five shots of Milla's exposed midriff, and thrice for every smile that cracks the face of Daxus.",2,"""Gun-blade"" movie which commits

See, that's how heroine Violet (Milla Jovovich, all bare-midriffed and tight-assed and leather-clad) can just suddenly have access to any number of guns or swords that she needs at any instant to kill the dozens or hundreds of similarly-armed bad guys that keep getting thrown at her in nearly every scene in this 87-minutes-too-long film.  Perhaps I also missed the explanation as to how Violet went from seemingly ordinary mother-to-be to unstoppable killing machine in a decade also?  How she fooled the extremely detailed scans of her actual DNA in the beginning of the film that should have kept her from entering a top-secret lab and taking the secret weapon in the humans' war against the hemophages - viral vampires of which she is the most perfect example.Yep, I must have missed all of the backstory, character development, and all sense of what the narrative is supposed to add up to here; or maybe it's all in the extra 6 minutes or whatever in the ""Unrated Director's Cut"" which (fortunately or not) isn't the version I watched.  Somehow I doubt it.  Somehow I think the entire reason this film exists is to show Milla dressed in a variety of skintight outfits killing literally hundreds and hundreds of bad guys in one heavily CGI-d, lightning-edited, MATRIX-like sequence after another.  Narrative sense, backstory, characterizations - all disposable to director/writer Kurt Wimmer, the man behind the astonishingly highly-rated EQUILIBRIUM, which at least does have a guy who can act when necessary, and a sort of plot to fall back on when the action flags a bit.  That film I thought was a prime example of the poverty of imagination in most American genre filmmaking - and the poverty of expectations in audiences that will lap up the same 50-year-old ideas in film after film as long as there are enough bullets and flying kicks.  Strangely enough ULTRAVIOLET hasn't maintained any kind of reputation, though for my money it's only slightly more inane.Oh, that's not to say that there isn't some slight pretense of a story here if you look hard for it; but most of it is lifted from John Cassavetes' 10 million times better GLORIA (1980) - a badass woman ends up taking care of a little boy who is the key to the bad guys' goals.  In that case, the son of the victims in a mob hit; in this case, a kid who is apparently the ""weapon"" that will be used against the hemophages (man, even the wordS Wimmer constructs are stupid).  But all that really does is lend a tiny, tiny bit of drama to the proceedings - Violet is so unstoppable that only having a kid to take care of could ever slow her down.  And that's really the problem in a nutshell, narrative-wise - where's the drama when you KNOW that the heroine simply cannot fail?But it's not completely awful (hence the second star).  The film was shot on digital video and it shows, but not always in a bad way.  I rather liked the brightness of the colors and the softness of some scenes, it was at times hard to tell just how much was CGI in a given sequence and the oddness of the Shanghai and Hong Kong architecture, where the film was shot, adds to the visual quality.  And Milla DOES look spectacularly hot.  But overall this is no deeper or more interesting as a story than most videogames, and the aesthetic isn't much different.  If I liked it just a bit more than the similarly braindead MR. AND MRS. SMITH that I watched last week, I guess it's because my expectations were even lower, and the SF milieu is more inherently appealing to me; but really it's on about the same level of inanity.

Basically a weird mix of ""Polar Express"" and ""Kill Bill 1""; with a plot that seems to have randomly selected script elements from every ""Matrix""-like film produced over the past ten years. When ""Polar Express was first released, many predicted that the substitution of animation for live action would take over the film industry. But they expected this to be driven from the animation side and not from the live action side. But ""Ultraviolet"" shows that this takeover is really being driven by the live action production companies. It is a cartoon with occasional cutaways to actors, interactions between actors and animation, and a voice-over narration.Interestingly, not only is this not a new thing, it actually goes back to the days of silent films. In the early 1920's Max and Dave Fleischer introduced a cartoon series called ""Out of the Inkwell"" which superimposed animated figures on real film backgrounds (allowing a live actor to interact with a cartoon character). Walt Disney (in his pre-Mickey Mouse days ) borrowed the idea for his series of ""Alice"" cartoons (there were 56 cartoons in the series) and even reversed the idea and superimposed a live actress (Virginia Davis) on an animated background. Obviously these early examples are crude by the standards of ""Ultraviolet's"" digital effects but the concept itself is identical.""Ultraviolent"" is not much of a story but it is decorated with many stunningly beautiful shots of Milla Jovovich as the title character. The story is weaker than the ""Underworld"" series but on a par with most of vampire-Matrix-post apocalyptic-CGI stuff the industry has been cranking out lately; including Milla's ""Resident Evil"" movies. The negative criticism of ""Ultraviolent"" relative to this other garbage is absurd; its all pretty awful but at least here there is an emphasis on the Milla visuals and her costumes are second only to Beckinsale's. They would be just as good if the costumer had realized that flat black presents major contrast problems.Milla can act (see ""Dummy"") but not much is required in that department for ""Ultraviolet"".""Ultraviolet"" is based on a comic book and the film features loads of lame hyper-edited martial arts scenes that don't require stunt work because they are just microsecond cuts edited together to simulate fighting.""Ultraviolet's"" plot revolves around a young boy that Milla is trying to protect. They are caught between a government run by the medical establishment and a resistance movement of disease-enhanced humans. That might sound like ""Dark Angel"" but instead of a ""Bladerunner"" production design, think of 1980's ""Flash Gordon"".All in all, ""Ultraviolent"" is as good as most of these futuristic exercises in excess and better than some.Then again, what do I know?

990014,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B000FGGE5Y,P. Hardy,"[1, 3]","Being a big Milla Jovovich fan, I was seriously expecting something great from Kurt Wimmer's film ""Ultraviolet,"" especially since the two minute teaser trailer showed it had serious promise and potential to knock ""V For Vendetta"" out of the water (maybe). I was willing to watch the movie just for her. As I sat there, there were things to complain about before the movie even started. It being Friday, I had to sit in front of several giggling teenage boys laughing at everything (even when the movie started), and a lousy sound system surrounding me. I felt like I was WATCHING TV at home, only on a big screen! The best thing I saw was probably the ""Silent Hill"" trailer. Of course when the movie started it showed off with a little comic book montage via Spider-Man style (even the music was reminiscent of Danny Elfman), featuring the many designs of Ultraviolet in the eyes of many artists and then the film opens off with a VERY QUICK narrative of the world now -via Violet disembodied voice- and a ""Metriod Prime"" action scene. The narration continues and the movie shoves aside one too many things that would've made this movie more likable.UV continues to movie at a pace that makes you think, ""Oh, this is gonna be good,"" especially with the entrance of Milla's character going through several check points to retrieve a TOP-PRIORITY package she was not to open (reminds me of the first ""Transporter""). From there the original currier of the package arrives and all hell breaks loose for Violet. She quickly proceeds into battle with soldiers that break like glass. Falling prey to curiosity, Violet opens the case and finds a . . . a kid in probably some of the worse CGI I've seen this side of the early 90s. The CGI throughout the film sometimes would show grace, but other times it looked very jerky, unrealistic, and cartoonish. One example being when Jovovich on the motorcycle driving sideways or vertically up the buildings or vehicles. This in theory is somewhat of a wild, yet interesting idea, but on film it doesn't look persuading enough to get a small clap of the hand. However, the constant change wardrobe, hair and their color was a nice touch. Milla running on the walls with the use of the gavity piece in her belt was cool too. The storyline from there is lost in the action scenes that at times made me smile, but fell short of a full playing deck. Jovovich along with the other actors in this film, felt as though they really didn't put their all into UV, no that I could blame them. The dialogue was horrible. I swear a thirteen-year-old could've done better than this, treated its audience like they had brains and minds to comprehend his story. But alas, Wimmer strews a horrible mixture of stories that never come together to make this film interesting in the least.For instance, Violet loosing her baby, her marriage, her former life and even the better explanation of hemophagia and what it done to people with the disease would've merited as something good if the writer had taken it seriously enough to delve into. I laughed when Milla whooped the men in the graveyard scene in their hair (shameful), the lobby scene was remicenist of the first Matrix only there was no shoot out you could see. Then the relationship between herself and Garth is unexplained not to mention pointless. Another laughable scene is after the disappointing seven hundred plus men, Six and Violet are at the playground laughing like everything is peachy. I felt as though I were watching a promo for the MTV movie awards, it was that bad. I think they tired far too much to make us feel or force Violet's loss which was never properly shown and her would be maternal connection with ""Six."" Cameron Bright was a poor choice of child actor to use for this ""Six"" character anyway. The editing of the film is even worse, the fight scenes were visible but they always fell short of impressive; You never got see Violet chopping up the soldiers you just heard it. The movie itself moved too quickly and was far to short. But in this case it was probably a blessing in disguise; I seriously wanted to get up and walk away from this movie but remained steadfast in my shaken resolve and continued watching.Ultraviolet is completely bloodless and if there was blood shown, it was only the hands and even then it wasn't satisfying. The swordplay seriously had be reconsidering what I said about ""King Arthur"" entirely. Compared to this movie, King Arthur is a four star gem in my book, at least they were trying! Jovovich looked as though every time she slashed at a man she was hitting him with the dull side of the prop sword. No blood whatsoever! And the villain Daxus was just unconvincing, far too underplayed in a parody sense to take him seriously, the clean freak. To my dismay, Ultraviolet was simply set up for action scenes, the best of them all shown in the trailer were at the beginning of the movie. It unveiled itself just like a comic book would, only while this could be forgiven in a comic book MOST of the time, this is a LIVE-ACTION film based on an unknown comic, not a moving pictures film that they sell on AMAZON.COM (I.E, Ultimate Avengers vol. 1 DVD). Unforgivable! All in all ""Ultraviolet"" is a sorely disappointing science fiction movie that key elements to make a great story but fell prey to its own sword and fell on it. Now I know what my mother meant by ""wanting to ""Get Carter"" for making such a bad movie."" Good thing I only spent $20 dollars on it, but even that feels like too much. ------- [a 3 out of 5]",3,"Ultraviolet is a sore disappointment, but Milla's Laughing . . ., March 4, 2006",1200268800,"01

But lowered expectations aside, I rented Ultraviolet for two reasons: Milla! and I loved writer/director Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium.  What we have with Ultraviolet is a video game come to life.  Only it's about as interesting or entertaining as watching someone else playing it.  What little backstory we get (and it ain't much) is ridiculously convoluted.  Something about scientists trying to engineer superior soldiers who instead create an airborne virus with vampire-like symptoms, hundreds are infected, they dissapear into concentration camps, an underground resistance springs up, so on.  The film takes place in the same kind of future world as Equilibrium, only with a bigger budget.  The action, which worked well in Equilibrium, Wimmer has taken way over the top here.  Violet (played by Jovovich) has a device on her belt buckle that enables her to go all wonky on gravity, walking on the ceiling and driving her motorcycle up the side of the buildings and her wristbands - a kind of technology called ""flat technology"" - enables her to carry an arsenal of weaponry up her sleeve, literally.  We get tons of Wimmer's patented ""Gun-kata,"" but it lacks anything close to resembling kinetic energy and is really just boring.  All the action sequences are boring!  And the whole movie is one extended, green screen, CGI action sequence.  What little meat the story has (and there ain't much) has gone rancid.

990029,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000FGGE5Y,Robert Badgley,"[0, 3]","I wanted SO much to like Ultraviolet,but it is plagued by poor editing and subplots that are either unfinished or thatsimply go nowhere.It is all look but no substance.The movie starts with Ultra telling us""I was born into a world,you may not understand"".Truer words were never spoken.The story concerns a research organization that alters a virus that has been around for centuries.The intention is to create stronger and faster soldiers;instead they create a contagion.We are told by a voice over by Ultra that she contracted the disease when her husband was killed(blood splattered on her),which in turn killed her unborn infant.As a result she fled underground and formed a resistance.A few scenes later we get our first plot contradiction,as she enters the research facility under the guise of being a courier to pick up a package.She gets the suitcase containing the ""weapon"" but her cover is blown when the real courier shows up.As she fights her way out security identifies her as one who has been confined to the facility in the past for EXPERIMENTATION and whose pregnancy was PURPOSEFULLY terminated(!?).She was human at one time but is now a hemophage like the rest of the resistance.The movie continues as she heads back to resistance headquarters and at one point stops to look inside the white case she carries.She discovers the ""weapon"" is a young boy.Her priorities,for some reason we're not privy to,change and she suddenly becomes a protective mother;totally opposite to the character we've so far seen.She spirits the boy away from the resistance leaders and turns to a fellow hemophage by the name of Garth for help.For some reason which again we are not privy to,Ultra needs a blood transfusion and Garth,who has pointy teeth,says it's lucky she didn't ""convert"" with her light exposure(?).After testing the boy he tells Ultra he doesn't have ""vampiral anti-genetic blood""(??);in fact he is useless to them.So Garth is a ...vampire too?While there the boy writes some chemical symbols on a magazine and Garth files it away for future reference(as we shall see).At this point there seems to be some kind of feelings between Garth and Ultra but that sub plot is not furthered in any way.The boy apparently is dying and when Daxus,the head of the research facility,contacts Ultra to get the boy back she finally relents when Daxus reveals he is the father.She takes him to a mall to leave him there but she again cannot bring herself to go through with it but the boy runs away and is caught by her own resistance.She fights and succeeds in freeing him from their grasp.Daxus finally talks Ultra into bringing the boy directly to the research facility and she shows up;but unbeknownst to Daxus,as a hologram.Daxus reveals that the boy really contains an anti-human vuris.The hemophages are no longer a threat to him so he's created a new menace people will line up at his doors to get the antidote for.It doesn't take long for Daxus to realize Ultra is not real but by this time she is long gone with the boy.They end up in a playground where the boy in a short time finally dies.With a teary Ultra kneeling over him,she is killed by Daxus who has followed her via a tracking device in the boy.Next thing we see is Ultra waking up having been revived by Garth.We also now see for the first time that Ultra has vampire teeth!? Garth is also NOW suddenly convinced that thewriting the boy did on that mag cover he stashed away,is a cure for the hemophages!? Ultra is not moved as she thinks the boy is still alive.Of course the showdown has to happen between Daxus and Ultra and a battle royale it is.During it we learn that Daxus has hemophage blood also so the fight goes neck in neck until Ultra finally triumphs.She and the boy are united.The boy WAS alive because the hemophage cells in her tears helped to transform him also into a hemophage.I have left alot out but I think you get the general idea.As the movie progresses the plot incongruities make things go from bad to worse as one can easily lose track of what is happening.Characters are doing things from motivations only known to them.The resistance movement lives in a spiral tipped building.They own the first half while a chinese gang,Ultra battles,owns the top portion.And after the battle,how she gets from the rooftop to a street level area with the boy in hand is not explained.Things like this are thrown out at you continually.Even the special effects have their lax moments.During a chase scene on a motorcycle Ultra is travelling first alongside an office building then straight up until she reaches the roof.While she is in midair her image gets shaky which effectively ruins the power of the moment and of the special effect itself.I know nothing of the history or creation of this film but I am certain there was alot of footage that got cut out here and what an obvious hatchet job was done too.It is like a puzzle that not only got reassembled improperly but with pieces missing!Either studio pressure,budget constraints or both got this thing whittled down,but at the price of the integrity of the picture.What a disappointment to such a promising property.For those interested the picture and sound quality are excellent here.The special features contained therein consist of the trailer,a 30 m ""UV Protection-The Making of UltraViolet"" short and optional commentary to the movie by star Milla Jovovich.Give this one a definite pass.",1,A Poor

After all, they both deal with a war between vampires and humans. The reality of the situation, however, is that had the filmmakers here tried to do a stupid American remake of a brilliant British TV miniseries, the end result, no matter how bad, would have been far better than this plotless mess. As far as I can tell, the script for this was cribbed together by someone who'd watched at least a thousand action movies and thought ""wouldn't it be cool to take all the best scenes from all these and put them together in one flick?"".  To be fair, they did a pretty good job of that. There are a lot of well-done action scenes to be found here. The problem is that the ""story"" holding them together is tissue-thin, with characters for whom ""cardboard"" would be a higher-rent district. And for some reason it bugs the hell out of me that Wimmer, along with all the other movies he's stolen scenes from here, also cannibalized his own work (more than one scene was lifted straight from Equilibrium). The only thing to recommend this is one brief, badly-lit shot of Milla Jovovich's rear end. I'm sure I've seen worse movies this month, but offhand I can't think of one.

990036,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000FGGE5Y,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 5]","""Ultraviolet"" is set in some near-future dystopia in which mankind is split between normal humans and ""hemophages"" - superhuman but short lived freaks created when an ancient virus was rediscovered and accidentally released.  With vampire-like teeth, HP's are easy to spot, and since they don't wear any gear to protect themselves from a virus they've already got, they're hard to miss even without being the most overstyled characters on screen.  Hunted down by ""Arch-Minister Daxus"", the HP's strike back - it's the ""Blood War"".  Violet is one of best HP's warriors, capable of mowing down Daxus's troops, breaking into his most secure facilities and possessing the flattest abs on Earth.  Violet has stolen a new weapon capable of exterminating the HP's, but she finds that the weapon is a young boy named Six (Cameron Bright).  It's not clear how he's a danger to the HP's, but the script wisely accepts that ambiguity, and soon everybody wants Six dead.  Obeying a deep maternal instinct, Violet turns against everybody else to protect Six.THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A DECENT MOVIE IF: Reading my own synopsis, it's easy to see how UV could have rocked, which makes it at least as easy to list the sins (multitudinous here) that killed it.  In fact, ""Ultraviolet"" wastes little time before proving itself one of the single most preposterous movies ever made, a botch on every level - sci-fi actioner or even cautionary fable.Wimmer was supposedly deposed by the studio which released a chopped-down version, but what's left in the mix - like an HP - looks too inherently wrong to have been cured by simply extra footage.  The amateurish script kicks off with embarrassingly expository dialog  (""As you know our campaign against the hemophages has been highly effective"") and garish set-design.  It's downhill from there.UV is supposedly set in the 21st century.  I can accept widely varying visions of how this century will look by the time it's half-over, consistency requires that one society remain within a single vision.  In UV, however, we still have cars, helicopters and firearms even though mankind has created devices that manipulate gravity and otherwise bend relative dimensions in space (Violet can store scads of weaponry in some sort of personal hyperspace - allowing her to single-handedly stage her own rip-off of the famous ""lobby scene"" from the first ""Matrix"" movie without being weighed down by some big duffle bag or having to wear anything that might obscure her superhuman abs; the humans possess this technology as well, with ""Six"" being carried around in an attach&eacute; case looking like a slightly outsized Macbook).  Any civilization advanced enough to re-write the laws of gravity and relative dimensions would have gotten past submachine pistols, rotary-wing aircraft or Buicks.  The world of ""Ultraviolet"" isn't so much advanced as ""futuristic"" - it looks very mod without actually being a plausible vision of an era set beyond our own.  Even the HP's amount to less of a plot element than a plothole.  The HP virus is extremely infectious - a point made well at the beginning of the flick when one of Daxus's men realizes that an unfortunate HP splattered him with its blood.  Unfortunately, this otherwise good scene is almost as fatally infected as the henchman, since it occurs inside the humans' blood bank.  Perhaps the HPs - who broke in without an exit strategy - intended a suicide mission to infect the blood.  The problem is that if the virus is that infectious, HP's wouldn't need to get to the humans' blood supply, they could just infect whole neighborhoods.  Humans wear all sorts of facial covers, but expose skin which proves sufficiently vulnerable to the HP virus.UV fails as an actioner because it's astoundingly arbitrary.  Daxus's hordes fire hundreds of bullets at Violet without scoring a hit - even when she's directly in their line of fire - while they fall in human waves under Violet's guns.  In a similar scene, Daxus faces off three armed HPs by himself, and dispatches them with a miracle machine pistol that can fire a fatal shot to each of three men in a single three-short burst, even when they fire first.  (This is most obvious in sword fighting scenes where hordes of enemy swordsmen are clearly swinging AWAY from Violet.)  Because the script can scare up few characters to pit against Violet, it's forced to throw at her large numbers of faceless hordes at her from the beginning.  Costumes aside, all fight scenes pit Violet against large numbers of apparently well trained and armed troops who simply cannot kill her.  In the ultimate of the flick's idiot-scenes, Violet is encircled by hostile rival HPs who are too stylishly duked out to realize that in encircling Violet with their guns drawn, they're targeting each other.  The script offers no explanation for its unbalanced lethality, instead drawing it to our attention when Violet warns Six that their enemies ""will kill you without even thinking"".  Putting aside the obvious joke that UV could do with fewer thoughtless killers, despite the firepower expended at that point and the stakes involved, ""Ultraviolet"" was surprisingly short on death, as if the film was so eager to kill without a thought that that the script had simply forgotten to kill anybody.  Daxus flops as a villain because he doesn't do much in a flick that defines its heroes and villains more in terms of style than good or evil deeds.  True, the plot has Daxus's ministry paralleling the actions of the WWII genocide, but that happens in the flick's brief expository prolog.  The bulk of the movie only shows the ministry getting its desserts for that prolog, and not doing much to deserve that reception.  In other words, despite his sneers and army of minions (and despite none-too-subtle clues that identify Daxus with the religious-right), Daxus begins the movie as a victim, not the villain.In short,

Cameron,"[1, 2]","In the backdrop of a dazzling glass world, where the people are shiny and clean and discardable cell phones are made from paper, ULTRAVIOLET is a dreamy spectacle starring Milla Jovovich in her tightest, most ridiculous outfit yet. She belongs to a group of disease-ridden exiles called the Hemophages, whose characteristic long canines have landed them the slur ""vampires."" With digital projectors, loud motorcycles, and the ability to manipulate gravity, scorned and vengeful Violet (Jovovich) is infiltrating the government's facilities to obtain a weapon that would be used to eliminate the Hemophages once and for all.Sound interesting? It's not. The plot makes a cheap 180 with the introduction of a child named Six (Cameron Bright), allowing battle-hardened Violet to touch into her matronly roots - a brave stab at injecting emotion into a movie that no one expected, or wanted, to be anything more than ninety minutes of explosions and an angry hot chick. Plot threads all race to the screen at the same time, forming a scrum - oh, we gotta get a weapon, now we gotta rescue a kid, uh-oh, I'm dying, he's dying, OH WAIT, there's a cure to the virus, nope never mind, now I gotta go rescue the kid. And death, apparently, is nothing sacred to writer/director Kurt Wimmer, who mows them down and brings them back like an X-Men comic. And why do Violet's hair and clothes constantly change colors? It was never satisfactorily explained.Don't expect too much more than gunplay and swords in ULTRAVIOLET - but expect to be wildly entertained with awful dialogue from the main antagonist (""It is on,"" he declares at the climactic final battle of the movie, brandishing his sword).",2,"""I am a titan.

990040,A3TSJWU8JW0D18,B000FGGE5Y,"Setmose ""Setmose""","[4, 4]","The Jeff Shannon review is spot on. The entertainment value here is in the visuals. They are very stylish, borrowing from TRON. The idea of having a tightly clad martial-arts babe as the heroin is cribbed from The Matrix. Milla even does an ""arm-breaker"" on a security guard in the very first fight sequence as did Trinity in The Matrix, so I guess we can call this an ""homage"". Ultraviolet has a rockin music soundtrack that is just so The Matrix that they might as well call it Matrix Re-Recorded. I loved it. It's actually a bit more electronic/techno than The Matrix. Great!Some reviewers have complained about the stylized martial-arts sequences where Violet impossibly lays down a dozen foes at a time. But this is nothing more than an ""homage"" (again) to the Bruce Lee films. The choreagraphy is taken straight from those early days in which Bruce Lee was portrayed as a supernatural power. Think of each confrontation where a supremely confident bad-guy (or dozen) thinks he can take Bruce, but after the first exchange of blows the camera reveals the bad-guy's sudden doubt -- that look of ""holy mother of god, I'm in way over my head"" -- followed by the grim determination to fight on towards a possible lucky finish. Which never happened of course. Bruce would start to taunt them, the cat playing with its prey, and then Bruce always took out the garbage at the end of the sequence. Same with Violet. The same sense of humor that allows playing out the inevitable in one fight after another is captured in Ultraviolet.It looks like Milla did a lot (certainly not all) of her own stunt work in Ultraviolet. Nice job.By the way, the Hemophages have a couple of new technologies -- ""flat store"" which is a form of ""dimensional compression"". This allows the wonderful visual effect of storing weapons in impossibly small spaces. The humans have it too, obviously, as in the storage of ""the weapon"" at the beginning. And the Hemophages alone have some sort of gravity-modifying tech that enables the wild motercycle-on-the-walls and martial-arts-on-the-ceiling sequences (which are great). Those are not to be attributed to the Hemophage disease which does produce super reflexes and stamina.I just happened to watch this film back-to-back with Aeon Flux as Jeff Shannon discusses. Though Aeon Flux has the more fully realized back-story, I think Ultraviolet is more fun to watch.It's Milla after all. I think she needs to do a film with some major talent that she can react off of, instead of being the center. Pair her up with Sean Connery, or Bruce Willis (again), or Denzel Washington, but in a non-sci-fi action situation. A cop-drama or a CIA intrigue... She's a decent actress who could possibly grow more than people think. Her Joan of Arc portrayel had some good dramatic moments, particularly in the scenes with Dustin Hoffman. She's certainly ahead of the current crop of teeny-bopper brat-pack types.For Milla's best action film so far, get the first Resident Evil installment available at Amazon. See my review here at Amazon.Late addition to this review: I understand that a new Indian Jones movie is in the works, and that Harrison Ford is in, and probably Sean Connery as well. Add Milla as the girl that an aging Jones relies on in action sequences as well as in the romance department.

990043,A3RLIS6YE5FR76,B000FGGE5Y,"S. Kippel ""yay me!""","[1, 3]","I really wanted to like Ultraviolet. From the writer and director of Equilibrium, Kurt Wimmer creates an alternative future where an ancient virus from Eastern Europe turns ordinary humans into vampires. An Orwellian government, bent of destroying the vampires, creates a weapon that will destroy them all. Milla Jovovich plays the comic-book inspired heroine who was infected with the virus and held for the humans to conduct expirements on her through various tests. The testing nearly kills her, which kills the child in her womb. She is sent by the vampire faction to capture the weapon and destroy it. So this film pretty much failed at everything. The entire story was told in the opening naration, and the rest of it was a series of vivid battles with a variety of uniform enemies with no faces, and no cause for existence. There isn't any story development, and some elements come from nowhere and go nowhere. There are peripheral enemies that are not introduced or explained, and Milla just decimates them, and there is nary mention of them after; there is a love story that lasts all of two lines; there is not a lot more. The acting is terrible, of course they weren't given much dialog to work with either. It seems as if Wimmer took a bunch of different ideas (each of which are interesting) and threw them together into a vomitorium. Even the graphics were sub-par. Some scenes looked amazing, and would make a good Blu-ray Disc reference piece, but the rest of it looked two generations old.

By 1995 that fact seem to fade and this movie proves it.Before 1965 these movies were being referred to as sexist because they would put women on display by having them wear certain type of clothes.  Ultraviolet seems to be exposing the same as those old sexist movies did but it no longer seems to matter.  Why?  Is it because she is slaughtering men?Sexist?  When did the movie studios ever come out with a film with one man taking on a large group of women and he would kill every one of them?  Oh, that is sexist but ""Ultraviolet"" is only a movie.Just like ""Kill Bill!""  The only time the star woman had to fight back is when she was attacking a woman.  She had no problem killing off 20 men all at once.  There was no competition.  Now that is Sexist!You want to see something that is sexist watch a lot of action adventure films that have been made these past ten years.  What wrong?  Can't anyone enjoy seeing a man running a sword threw a woman?  I guess not.  Every time I bring this topic up I get the same reaction.  Oh, I must enjoy seeing women get killed!  Boy, I am sick!Ultraviolet is supposed to be for entertainment and it is a fantasy yet it is sexist.  So, before you start thinking that I am making something out of nothing you better give this some serious thought.

Incidently, the answer of course is the same--a life without love is not a life at all.  You are just waiting to die.  I thought that was really neat.Anyway, this is no Oscar contender (nor was Equilibrium) but it is very slick and features some very interesting premises on the future.  The art direction is gorgeous and the use of white light really helps to convey the sterility of this future world.The villain is interesting and entertainingly played by the actor.  I loved the showdown at the end.Milla does such an amazing job.  We have seen her do physical stuff before so that is no stretch.  However, what makes her performance here so singular is the emotion she brings to the character and the fact that she is allowed to be beautiful and more feminine.  All the toughness and such are there as well, but this time her character is more balanced.I loved the concepts, music, and special effects of the film.  I am glad that they looked different.

990065,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000FGGE5Y,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 5]","OK, two stars. Sorry about that if you like this film, but I cannot tell you a lie. Before you dislike my review, let me tell you that I really loved Kurt Wimmer's first film as directo `Equilibrium' and its gun-kata actions. ""Silly"" some say. Or ""Childish."" Yes, I know, but I also know that it's great fun. And Christian Bale's gun actions are sensational.But I should be talking about 'Ultraviolet.' Well, `Ultraviolet' starts promisingly. Shot with Sony's high definition camera, the digital touch of the opening sequences perfectly matches the futuristic city and its apocalyptic story about the battle between the two kinds of humans. The first 20 minutes are very good with gadgets and fighting, Sure, many of them look rather ridiculous like gravity-defying motorcycle, but I like the idea precisely because it is ridiculous. And the opening title sequences with the clever use of comic book are brilliant.Then after the secrets about the `secret weapon' are revealed, the film suddenly loses its power. Occasionally the film shows actions, but they at best are mildly interesting. The reason is simple: weakly written characters and inept editing that killed any momentum of the gun/martial actions. The action choreography needs more stylish touch, or at least some originality.Now, let me give you advice. If you have not seen `Equilibrium,' go and get it. Then after watching it, compare it with `Ultraviolet.' You get similar dark, futuristic world, gun actions, and super-cool hero/heroine, but which is really cool? Which editing is superior? And most importantly, which action is more exciting to see? I give you a hint: Christian Bale.Yes, 'Equilibrium' stars Christian Bale who as you know went on to become the Batman. Christopher Nolan's `Batman Begins' proves one thing and that is, to make a good action film, you need an actor who can act, or infuse life into the character s/he plays. `Ultraviolet' has Milla Jovovich who was terrific elsewhere (like Leeloo in `The Fifth Element'), but here she is far from her best. Her character in the Besson film was never boring a single moment while her Violet and her emoting sound completely hollow in `Ultraviolet.'Kurt Wimmer's `Ultraviolet' is a huge disappointment after watching his much better work `Equilibrium.' Familiar phrase is `Rent before you buy it"" but in this case perhaps you should rent his debut film before this one.
