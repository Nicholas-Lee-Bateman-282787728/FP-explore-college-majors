Anyway the President William Foster (Sam Waterston) is planning a disarmament treaty. Everyone knows including the president that the Soviets never keep a promise. How ever something has to be done and the President thinks he has a workable plan. Openly opposed to the plan is General R. Pendleton Lloyd (Jason Robards) sot of a Douglas Macarthur of his time. Being opposed is one thing; however the constitution leaves only one way to handle this situation (the election). Yea right. Colonel MacKenzie 'Mac' Casey (Forest Whitaker), Lloyd's right hand man gets suspicious. He thinks Lloyd is planning ""Yea right"" for real and brings this suspicion to the Whitehouse.As the story unfolds is the threat real and if so what can be done about it? Whose side are you on? If you were Mac working for a great General and a good friend, what would you do?  Where should loyalty lay? If the president relied on blackmail, would he be any better then the opposition?  How would the Soviets react to a military take over in the US?This is a very good remake of ""Seven Days in May"" (1964).It goes to show that the theme even thought it was conceived during the cold war that it is still timeless. They did not distract from the script trying to be politically correct. It is wroth watching both versions.OK let's face the real question this movie poses. Does the end justify the means? Or is the end the results of the means?Seven Days in May",5,A remake of Seven Days in May (1964),1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,1625,"['story', 'was', 'adjusted', 'little', 'book', 'Seven', 'Days', 'May', 'Fletcher', 'Knebel', 'accommodate', 'media', 'however', 'essence', 'story', 'still', 'are', 'not', 'woods', 'today', 'Anyway', 'President', 'William', 'Foster', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'planning', 'disarmament', 'treaty', 'Everyone', 'including', 'president', 'Soviets', 'never', 'keep', 'promise', 'How', 'ever', 'something', 'be', 'done', 'President', 'workable', 'plan', 'Openly', 'opposed', 'plan', 'General', 'R.', 'Pendleton', 'Lloyd', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'sot', 'Douglas', 'Macarthur', 'time', 'Being', 'opposed', 'one', 'thing', 'however', 'constitution', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'handle', 'situation', 'election', 'right', 'Colonel', 'MacKenzie', ""'Mac"", 'Casey', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Lloyd', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'suspicious', 'Lloyd', 'planning', 'Yea', 'right', 'real', 'suspicion', 'Whitehouse.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'threat', 'real', 'so', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'Whose', 'side', 'are', 'were', 'Mac', 'working', 'great', 'General', 'good', 'friend', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'Where', 'should', 'loyalty', 'lay', 'president', 'relied', 'blackmail', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'then', 'opposition', 'How', 'would', 'Soviets', 'react', 'military', 'take', 'US', 'very', 'good', 'remake', 'Seven', 'Days', 'May', '1964', '.It', 'show', 'theme', 'even', 'thought', 'was', 'conceived', 'cold', 'war', 'still', 'timeless', 'did', 'not', 'distract', 'script', 'trying', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'wroth', 'watching', 'versions.OK', 'let', 'face', 'real', 'question', 'movie', 'end', 'means', 'end', 'results', 'means', 'Seven', 'Days', 'May']",N/A

Both movies are good.In this remake, Forrest Whitaker plays a level-headed US Marine Major (our Hero!!).  The ever-stately Sam Waterston plays the President with eloquent grace.  Another excellent performance is given by the late Jason Robards, who plays (ironically) the power-hungry facist General leading the coup.'MY' only mistake was I should have been more careful when I placed the order.  The VHS I received had spanish subtitles throughout the entire movie.  A truly beautiful language - Spanish - but regarding the subtitles in this film - I found them an annoying distraction.Other than that - a very good film - which should be appreciated by any military enthusiast and/or black-helicopter wierdo.

42250,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,0783107188,Matthew Kresal,"[6, 6]","The Enemy Within is a well-done remake of one of my favorite films Seven Days In May. While of course not as good as the 1964 classic this film still packs quite a punch delivering the original's frightening and all-too possible scenario. This is despite being too briskly paced and lacking Rod Serling's script.Forest Witiker does well as Colonel Cassey though he is a little hard to watch at times. Sam Waterston does well as the Southern President and its a shame we don't see more of him. Dana Delaney really doesn't add much to the film but she plays a necessary role in the film. And of Jason Robards does well as the villain of the film as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General R. Pendleton Lloyd.While there are numerous subplots removed and some added (though the Russians weren't really needed in this film) the film still manages to be true to the classic's plot. The script manages to convey a sense of urgency in the story and the revelations are revealed in a nice manor. The film has a little bit of action in it and these scenes are mostly unnecessary but they don't hurt the film very much.Overall The Enemy Within is a better then average made for TV movie. As I wrote above this film is not in the same caliber as the original film, but this film it still manages to present a frightening and all-too possible scenario. A nice little suspense film to pass your time with and it's nothing more and nothing less then that.",3,A Good Remake of Seven Days In May,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,1447,"['Enemy', 'Within', 'well-done', 'remake', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Seven', 'Days', 'May', 'course', 'not', 'as', 'good', '1964', 'classic', 'film', 'still', 'quite', 'punch', 'delivering', 'original', 'frightening', 'all-too', 'possible', 'scenario', 'being', 'too', 'briskly', 'paced', 'lacking', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'script.Forest', 'Witiker', 'well', 'Colonel', 'Cassey', 'little', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'well', 'Southern', 'President', 'shame', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'more', 'Dana', 'Delaney', 'really', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'film', 'necessary', 'role', 'film', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'well', 'villain', 'film', 'Chairman', 'Joint', 'Chiefs', 'Staff', 'General', 'R.', 'Pendleton', 'Lloyd.While', 'are', 'numerous', 'subplots', 'removed', 'added', 'Russians', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'needed', 'film', 'film', 'still', 'be', 'true', 'classic', 'plot', 'script', 'convey', 'sense', 'urgency', 'story', 'revelations', 'are', 'revealed', 'nice', 'manor', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'mostly', 'unnecessary', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'film', 'very', 'much.Overall', 'Enemy', 'Within', 'better', 'then', 'average', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'wrote', 'film', 'not', 'same', 'caliber', 'original', 'film', 'film', 'still', 'present', 'frightening', 'all-too', 'possible', 'scenario', 'nice', 'little', 'suspense', 'film', 'pass', 'time', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less', 'then']",N/A

42253,AG7EF0SVBQOUX,0783107188,"WriterGirl ""WriterGirl""","[0, 0]","I have been a fan of ""Seven Days in May"" for years. I was interested is seeing how this remake measured up. Overall it was pretty good. The personal goals of the Col Caseys were different: Kirk Douglas was single and had a crush on his boss's mistress, Forest Whitaker is a married man trying to understand his troubled son. Sam Waterston interjects more of a sense of humor in his character as the president, unlike Frederic March's more serious portrayal. Different characters are involved in the possible coup and different characters die during the film. Jason Robards is General Lloyd, a patriotic officer who feels strongly that the president's desire to balance the budget will wreak havoc on the US military's ability to defend the country against all enemies. It was hard to compare him to Burt Lancaster's Gen. Scott. Their characters stood alone and were good fits for their venues. Dana Delaney is the chief of staff and advisor. She projects the idea there may be more going on between her and the widower president. A remake does not have to be exactly like the original. A good writer and director will take the plot and characters and make them into something more relevant for their time. This version is more suspenseful in different ways. This remake's ending was a little more provocative than the original.
