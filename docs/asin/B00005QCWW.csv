674793,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B00005QCWW,Boggman!,"[7, 7]","""Encounter in the third dimension"" contains a pretty neat concept......Let's film a 3-D documentary IN 3D about the history of 3D and 3D movies, throw in some clips of classic 3D movies and mix them with the latest and greatest in computer animated 3D virtual reality! AWESOME!The movie has some great old footage, and is very informative while being consistently entertaining. A nice job all the way through- even though Elvira is grossly underused!!  I can not wait to see what else NWAVE pictures has up their sleeve. They are definitely on the cutting edge of 3D home entertainment. I have yet to see anything that rivals ""Encounter"", ""Alien Adventure"" or ""Haunted Castle"" on the 3D market!Very well done!Do not watch this in 2D, howver; highly recommended for 3D lovers!!!",5,A fantastic encounter!,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,777,"['Encounter', 'third', 'dimension', 'pretty', 'neat', 'concept', 'Let', 'film', '3-D', 'documentary', 'IN', '3D', 'history', '3D', '3D', 'movies', 'throw', 'clips', 'classic', '3D', 'movies', 'mix', 'latest', 'greatest', 'computer', 'animated', '3D', 'virtual', 'reality', 'AWESOME', 'movie', 'great', 'old', 'footage', 'very', 'informative', 'being', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'nice', 'job', 'way', 'through-', 'even', 'Elvira', 'grossly', 'underused', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'NWAVE', 'pictures', 'up', 'sleeve', 'are', 'definitely', 'cutting', 'edge', '3D', 'home', 'entertainment', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'anything', 'Encounter', 'Alien', 'Adventure', 'Haunted', 'Castle', '3D', 'market', 'Very', 'well', 'done', 'Do', 'not', 'watch', '2D', 'howver', 'highly', 'recommended', '3D', 'lovers']",Encounter in the Third Dimension 3-D Large Format
674794,A2IOI5MO10XO80,B00005QCWW,"Elak Swindell ""Movie Addict""","[13, 13]","""Haunted Castle"" and ""Alien Adventure"" are great, but the concept and dimensional enjoyment of ""Encounter in the Third Dimension"" makes it better than the other two.  The film is an excellent way of showing how 3D started and how it works with lots of prime examples thrown in, other than the entire movie itself.  I do wish the mine ride was longer though (the one which ends with the big, round, stone ball slamming into the tunnel) and there was more shown of the T3 Experience.  Sure, the Jules Verne ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" ride certainly makes up for it, but the effects in the shorter example were awesome, like the bats.  Best of all, the film doesn't look all that dated CGI wise for a 1998 production.  Now I've definitely got to get the sequel ""Misadventures in 3D"" DVD.  Noticed something stupid in the credits for ""Encounter"".  Instead of saying ""Cassandra Peterson as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"", it redundantly reads, ""Elvira as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"".  Unlike the other 3D IMAX films, this one is good either in stereo depth form or 2D wise.  Of course, the best is 3D since that is the whole point of the story anyway.  I highly recommend this movie to all 3D collectors.",5,Best 3D IMAX Film,1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,1210,"['Haunted', 'Castle', 'Alien', 'Adventure', 'are', 'great', 'concept', 'dimensional', 'enjoyment', 'Encounter', 'Third', 'Dimension', 'better', 'other', 'two', 'film', 'excellent', 'way', 'showing', 'how', '3D', 'started', 'how', 'lots', 'prime', 'examples', 'thrown', 'other', 'entire', 'movie', 'do', 'wish', 'mine', 'ride', 'was', 'longer', 'one', 'big', 'round', 'stone', 'ball', 'slamming', 'tunnel', 'was', 'more', 'shown', 'T3', 'Experience', 'Sure', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'Journey', 'Center', 'Earth', 'ride', 'certainly', 'up', 'effects', 'shorter', 'example', 'were', 'awesome', 'bats', 'Best', 'film', ""n't"", 'look', 'dated', 'CGI', 'wise', '1998', 'production', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'definitely', 'got', 'get', 'sequel', 'Misadventures', '3D', 'DVD', 'Noticed', 'something', 'stupid', 'credits', 'Encounter', 'Instead', 'saying', 'Cassandra', 'Peterson', 'Elvira', 'Mistress', 'Dark', 'redundantly', 'Elvira', 'Elvira', 'Mistress', 'Dark', 'other', '3D', 'IMAX', 'films', 'one', 'good', 'either', 'stereo', 'depth', 'form', '2D', 'wise', 'course', 'best', '3D', 'whole', 'point', 'story', 'anyway', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', '3D', 'collectors']",Encounter in the Third Dimension 3-D Large Format
