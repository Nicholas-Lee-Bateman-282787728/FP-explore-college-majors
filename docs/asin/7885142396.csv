The soldier held the wounded general captive and attempted to take him back to his land to claim his reward.  The soldier was a humble farmer forcibly conscripted into the army; the general, on the other hand, turned out to be the crown prince of the enemy state.  During the long journey, the two developed a reluctant bond, as they encountered wild animals, bandits, and other dangers, while being pursued by the brother of the crown prince and his men, who was determined to kill them in order to ascend to the throne.  Leehom Wang plays the condescending general with wit and humor, but the one to watch is Jackie Chan.  He surely knows how to act.

488652,A14XW8BJGEBM91,7885142396,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[3, 3]","I still remember a time, not long ago, when Jackie Chan was the flavor-of-the-month in Hollywood. He was hot, and it seemed that he was going stay that way for a while. But his popularity, for many reasons, began to decrease in the USA, and his movies did not succeed as before. It doesn't matter, though: Jackie Chan is a marketable star all over the world and he keeps doing quite entertaining films, the majestic and absorbing ""Little Big Soldier"" being the latest, an effort that should not be missed.The film is very ambitious, with an impressive production design. It is a period piece set when China was divided into several states fighting with each other, some looking for an eventual unification. It was at one of these battles between two different states, that we meet the soldier (Jackie Chan), the sole Liang survivor between hundreds that fought a battle between the Wei and the Liang. He is not alone: among the Wei, he finds out that The General (Leehom Wang) is still alive, although badly wounded. The Soldier ""captures"" the General, and takes care of him, eventually curing him. He is planning to take his prisoner to the Liang State as some sort of valuable trophy of war. However, the soldier is not the only one that values the General. They are followed by a little, strong group led by Prince Wen (Steve Yoo). In addition, on the way to Liang, the soldier and the general will face and fight with bandits and others, including a treacherous, beautiful woman.""Little Big Soldier"" is about an important period in Chinese history, when brothers were fighting brothers, apparently for the same reason. Jackie Chan plays a serious role, but being, well, the funny and acrobatic Jackie Chan that we know. He plays a simple and honorable peasant that had to go to war. He adds some hilarious moments to the movie, and some quite dramatic, too. Probably because of his age, Chan doesn't include too many martial arts scenes, and the fighting is mostly done with weapons. The cinematography is also quite grandiose. The ending will take you by surprise, and I may add that it probable changes the tone of the film. This is one special movie. The Blu-ray + DVD edition includes a making-of documentary, music video, and more. (China/Hong Kong, 2010, color, 92 mins plus additional materials).

488662,A2HVL790PBWYTU,7885142396,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Despite its outbursts of humor, there's a sort of melancholy, elegiac feel to LITTLE BIG SOLDIER. Viewing this period film, you can't help but be struck with how Jackie Chan is now opting to sit out the more arduous action stunts. Not even Jackie can beat down Father Time who, I'm assuming, can easily divert whatever everyday household utensil Jackie cleverly applies against him. But our man is aging gracefully, so give him that.LITTLE BIG SOLDIER (""Da bing xiao jiang"") has long been a labor of love for Jackie. It's been in the works for so long now, that when it was first proposed, Jackie had intended to play the much younger role of Leehom Wang's warlord. Instead, today, he plays the reluctant old soldier. The movie is set during China's Warring States Period, before the Qin Dynasty united the country. From this chaotic era seven feuding states eventually rose to prominence. In 227BC our story begins, in the aftermath of the horrific battle at Phoenix Hill between the armies of the Wei and the Liang.There are only two survivors, a timid footsoldier from Liang (Jackie) and the Wei's fierce young general (Leehom Wang). The footsoldier, the heavy years pressed on him, has survived by playing dead (dude has a collapsible arrow on  his chest). He sees an opportunity to seize the wounded general captive, hoping for a fat reward and safe passage home to Liang. LITTLE BIG SOLDIER, more a buddy film than a wuxia epic, chronicles the pair's bicker-colored journey. Inevitably, the soldier and the general learn, to their dismay, that they would have to cooperate with each other to surmount the obstacles they encounter. And close behind, the Wei's crown prince is in hot pursuit, intending to slay his own general for some mysterious purpose.After decades of killing himself for his audience, Jackie Chan deserves some slack. Now in his mid-fifties Jackie Chan eschews his patented death-defying stunts in favor of character acting and slapstick comedy, except that his slapstick does still feature the occasional remarkable bit of acrobatics (that creative sequence with the rock-throwing, for example). Jackie and Leehom Wang make a fun odd couple. Jackie's ebbulience and natural screen presence keep the whole enterprise afloat, and his pragmatic coward is inherently appealing and, to me, very reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton (except, y'know, more talky). The plot does tend to ramble, and just when you think this is a straight-up chase comedy, the story throws in a swerve at the end. Except that I'm not sure the movie's earned the emotional reaction it's seeking in its closing moments. LITTLE BIG SOLDIER is an amiable film showcasing a fine acting performance from Jackie Chan, but the story lacks weight. The film also loses traction by featuring characters that only provided jarring moments and made me scratch my head in bafflement: those weird bandits and that cryptic songstress, what the hell was up with them? I'm trying hard to be objective, to not compare this one with past Jackie Chan classics.

488669,A5R3U8ZSFKAL4,7885142396,"Paul Lawrence ""'EJL'""","[0, 0]","Jacky Chan films used to be events. I remember when you would actually know of a new one coming out. Nowadays he's been superseded to a greater or lesser extent by a new breed of chopsocky flick - or more to the point, a newer bunch of actors. But there is life in the old dog yet and the guy just refuses to stop, just refuses to accept some sort of role as elder statesman to be wheeled out whenever a `name' is required. And that's inspiring. Well, to me at least.This flick sees Chan continuing in a somewhat more dramatic idiom that requires acting, requires something other than the ability to mug shamelessly for the camera while pulling off novelty martial arts moves. Basically, the synopsis of this film is that after a battle the only survivors are a low ranked soldier just wanting to live a peaceful life (Chan) and the enemy general (Leehom Wang), who he captures wounded. The movie follows them through a number of misadventures as Chans character tries to get his captive back to his home city to collect what he hopes will be a big enough reward for him to set himself up with a nice little farm.The film is nicely shot and is set against the backdrop of the Warring States period in Chinese history which gives it a flavour of truthfulness. Props are deserved for the fact that Chan plays a character who knows his way around a fight but isn't some all-conquering legend. Also the fight scenes actually are a bit more like fight scenes rather than displays of wire borne acrobatics that take half an ice age to be resolved.As the movie glides along the unlikely pair deal with a few subplots, fight each other and side by side and in general earn some respect for each other. Nobody is going to win a prize for writing the plot to this film, it's pretty obvious how just about everything is going to pan out pretty much from the get go, but if you can suspend your disbelief (and if you are a fan of chopsocky flicks you should be well versed in this) then Little Big Soldier is a pleasantly made and presented film with nice choreography and a few slices of humour thrown in for good measure. The acting isn't too shabby (even Chan) though it must be said that for all the good points there is a central failing of the work. And that is the film fails to create  the sense that these two guys, thrown together against their will, actually come to a certain camaraderie. The whole thing rides on this and it rings hollow. Either due to the direction of lack of experience when it comes to real emoting (though Chan was good in the Karate Kid remake) the fact is that the viewer never really feels any connection. It's all just too transparent and the juxtaposition of these two characters is, in the end, too big a bridge for the film to cross.In terms of special features these are reasonable. Photo galleries, some interviews etc. And note that despite the fact this disc has subtitle options you may not always be able to access them. Using an X-box DVD player I could not get them to function. My PC allowed access as did a multi-region DVD player I have. Exactly why one style of player could not utilise the subtitles but others could is not a question I have the answer to. But it makes buying with 100% confidence tricky.I scored it relatively cheap and I'd suggest you do the same unless you are a manic Chan completest but for what it is I've no hesitation in giving it a steady three stars.",3,A nice idea with some tasteful elements that kind of misses the spot,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,3419,"['Jacky', 'Chan', 'films', 'used', 'be', 'events', 'remember', 'when', 'would', 'actually', 'know', 'new', 'one', 'coming', 'out', 'been', 'superseded', 'greater', 'lesser', 'extent', 'new', 'breed', 'chopsocky', 'flick', 'more', 'point', 'newer', 'bunch', 'actors', 'life', 'old', 'dog', 'yet', 'guy', 'just', 'stop', 'just', 'accept', 'sort', 'role', 'elder', 'statesman', 'be', 'wheeled', 'out', 'whenever', 'name', 'required', 'inspiring', 'Well', 'least.This', 'flick', 'Chan', 'continuing', 'somewhat', 'more', 'dramatic', 'idiom', 'acting', 'something', 'other', 'ability', 'mug', 'shamelessly', 'camera', 'pulling', 'off', 'novelty', 'martial', 'arts', 'moves', 'Basically', 'synopsis', 'film', 'battle', 'only', 'survivors', 'are', 'low', 'ranked', 'soldier', 'just', 'wanting', 'live', 'peaceful', 'life', 'Chan', 'enemy', 'general', 'Leehom', 'Wang', 'who', 'wounded', 'movie', 'number', 'misadventures', 'Chans', 'character', 'tries', 'get', 'captive', 'back', 'home', 'city', 'collect', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'big', 'enough', 'reward', 'set', 'up', 'nice', 'little', 'farm.The', 'film', 'nicely', 'shot', 'set', 'backdrop', 'Warring', 'States', 'period', 'Chinese', 'history', 'flavour', 'truthfulness', 'Props', 'are', 'deserved', 'fact', 'Chan', 'character', 'who', 'way', 'fight', ""n't"", 'all-conquering', 'legend', 'Also', 'fight', 'scenes', 'actually', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'like', 'fight', 'scenes', 'rather', 'displays', 'wire', 'borne', 'acrobatics', 'take', 'ice', 'age', 'be', 'resolved.As', 'movie', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'deal', 'few', 'subplots', 'fight', 'other', 'side', 'side', 'general', 'earn', 'respect', 'other', 'Nobody', 'going', 'win', 'prize', 'writing', 'plot', 'film', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'how', 'just', 'everything', 'going', 'pan', 'out', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'go', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'are', 'fan', 'chopsocky', 'flicks', 'should', 'be', 'well', 'versed', 'then', 'Little', 'Big', 'Soldier', 'pleasantly', 'made', 'presented', 'film', 'nice', 'choreography', 'few', 'slices', 'humour', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'acting', ""n't"", 'too', 'shabby', 'even', 'Chan', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'good', 'points', 'central', 'failing', 'work', 'film', 'create', 'sense', 'two', 'guys', 'together', 'will', 'actually', 'come', 'certain', 'camaraderie', 'whole', 'thing', 'rides', 'hollow', 'due', 'direction', 'lack', 'experience', 'when', 'real', 'emoting', 'Chan', 'was', 'good', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'remake', 'fact', 'viewer', 'never', 'really', 'connection', 'just', 'too', 'transparent', 'juxtaposition', 'two', 'characters', 'end', 'too', 'big', 'bridge', 'film', 'cross.In', 'terms', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'reasonable', 'Photo', 'galleries', 'interviews', 'etc', 'note', 'fact', 'disc', 'subtitle', 'options', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'able', 'access', 'Using', 'X-box', 'DVD', 'player', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'function', 'PC', 'allowed', 'access', 'did', 'multi-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'have', 'Exactly', 'why', 'one', 'style', 'player', 'could', 'not', 'utilise', 'subtitles', 'others', 'could', 'not', 'question', 'have', 'answer', 'buying', '100', '%', 'confidence', 'tricky.I', 'scored', 'relatively', 'cheap', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'do', 'same', 'are', 'manic', 'Chan', 'completest', 'what', ""'ve"", 'hesitation', 'giving', 'steady', 'three', 'stars']","Little Big Soldier (2010, Jackie Chan) Special Edition - DVD9"

(Even Dustin Hoffman's Little Big Man)But it really works!A soldier hides under fallen comrades,survives battle massacre, rescues a wounded general and their natures clash. It becomes a battle between the General and the grunt. But a kind, wise grunt, Chan. Chan is Chan, which makes the film worth watching.The script starts a bit cliche but QUICKLY becomes more complex,interesting and involving on many levels. A lot more action.Chinese movie-making has come light years in past decades; my recommendation in its military action genre -Red Cliff International Version - Part I & Part II [BluRay] orRed Cliff International Version - Part I & Part II(DVD). Action plus'depth'. A great deal of depth. Very good production values.

488675,A238W7T3KJAKQH,7885142396,shaun brammer,"[0, 0]","I have always been a huge Jackie Chan fan. I grew watching him and Bruce Lee on the weekends on USA&#8217;s Kung Fu Theater. So, Jackie has really been a part of my life for a long time. I also went and purchased as many of his films as I could, just because I am huge geek. I have always appreciated his ability to mix action and comedy. I never cared that the acting was bad, or the story was about as well written and believable as Letters to Penthouse. I always felt happy watching him. As the years have gone by Jackie&#8217;s stunts have slowed down, understandably. He has also tried to make more movies that showcase his acting rather than action. Plus, he has become a super patriot. Many have even accused him of being a Party mouth piece. So, his current films are filled with nationalist sentiment and brief spurts of action. Little Big Solider is such a movie. That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not worth watching.The film takes place during the Spring and Autumn era of Chinese history. This is a popular time to portray in film as there were seven states that were fighting for control of what we think of today as China. Eventually each state falls to the Kingdom of Qin, and that is when, as popular history suggests, China was first unified. You can already see the nationalism being set up. Jackie plays The Solider, in classic Chan style no one has a name, who plays dead during a battle between his forces of Liang and those of Wei. He thinks he is the only one to survive until he comes across the young general of the Wei army, who is also nameless, and is played by Wang Lee Hom. Chan takes him captive and starts to take him back to Liang to claim a reward. Little do either of them know but the General&#8217;s little brother, Prince Wen, played by Yoo Seungjun, is taking advantage of this battle to kill off his brother and claim the throne. He is assisted in this by Captain Yu, played by Yu Rongguang. Oops, I guess a few people got names. This begins a chase that twists and turns over the surface of Phoenix Mountain as Chan tries to get Hom back to Liang and Hom tries to escape him and his murderous brother. There are many humorous and weird encounters with other people all over the Mountain, like the tribal people who live there, members of other armies, Kongzi and his disciples, and the Songstress, played by Lin Peng. This character only seems to exist so there can be a pretty lady in the film. Jackie likes pretty ladies.This movie moves fast, the action comes quickly and frequently. However, it is a low key action. This is more of the barebones comedic fighting Chan is good at. It all takes place in the wilderness, so, sticks and nifty little tricks with feet, and flips. There are no over the top stunts. Unfortunately, the action doesn&#8217;t stay going. I think because of Chan&#8217;s age and his desire to focus on story more than stunt, the action comes and goes in little increments. While all of it is good, there was nothing that got a visceral response out of me, unlike so many other Chan films of the past.The acting was decent. Chan was the best out of all the cast members. He played this veteran who just wanted to stay alive, because he was the last of three sons, and wanted to honor his father&#8217;s wish of carrying on the family name. However serious that may sound, he isn&#8217;t. He is very happy-go-lucky, in love with life and nature. Like a goofy Taoist he roams around the wilderness exclaiming how marvelous it all is and singing a song about trying to figure out what crops to planet. While there is a sad aspect to him, this is really one of Chan&#8217;s most lovable characters. Wang Lee Hom on the other hand was kind of a disappointment. The banter that goes on between him and Chan is funny. Hom plays the straight man to Chan&#8217;s goofball, but Hom is so wooden, stiff, in this film, and it makes all the funny feel forced. To his credit, Hom handles the action really well, and watching him and Jackie go at it through the film is pretty fun.There are a couple of themes in this film. First, there is the nationalism theme. The movie keeps going back to a theme that has been played out in movies and video games and books, that being, conquer all and you bring peace. Unify that land and you will bring stability to all under Heaven. While there is no character that expresses this desire directly as a goal, it is brought up in dialogue frequently. Another theme is one of peace. Chan&#8217;s character keeps making references to peace and peaceful living. Living as a small person, happy with fields and livestock and family. He looks down a little on bigwigs like his captive. He only wants to capture the General to be rewarded land so he can live the small life he dreams about. The General does not share the same view about peace. He wishes to die on a battlefield, but that is his journey in the film, to find the value of peace. Of course, Qin conquers all in the end and what these characters wanted is of little consequence. I don&#8217;t want to give away the ending, but it was nice, and a little sad. Chan did a very good job with his characters closing scene. However, the closing frames ruin it when the film explains peace came to China when Qin destroyed everyone else. This is not a good thing. This period of history was bloody and nasty and the King of Qin was not a nice fellow. He was a tyrant whose sons where over thrown. However, this is China&#8217;s birth, don&#8217;t question it.In conclusion, this film was good, not great, but good. It lacks the true legacy of Chan&#8217;s films, but is still entertaining enough. While the themes are deep in of themselves, they are handled too lightly here. Other films have handled these themes better, Hero for one. The balance of fun and seriousness in this film gets bent. This takes away from the comedy a little bit. Also, those times when it should be very serious, even emotional, it isn&#8217;t. It is just nice. Don&#8217;t expect too much and you can enjoy it.",3,The Veteran Chan,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,6031,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'huge', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'fan', 'grew', 'watching', 'Bruce',

Some people used to nonstop Chan action and comedy throughout and up to the end credits may be a little taken aback by this film (which is why I gave it four instead of five stars) but if you look at the ending bringing a resolution to the early charge of disgrace regarding Chan's character, the ending makes sense.  The two leads work fantastic against and with one another.  As I am only acquainted with Chan's previous work, I will write this is the best acting I've seen from him.  There's none of Crime Story's solemness and none of the (for a better word) mugging of Chan's early comedies (though I also love that Chan as well).  Add to that an excellent script, fantastic cinematography and music and this movie is a winner.  Comparing this with Chan's last American movie ""The Spy Next Door"" is like night and day.

Of course Chan has other films that ""feel modern"", like some of his recent American fare, but even those play for wide audiences and are conventional. ""Little Big Soldier"" feels more like a major Hong Kong release that appeals to regular joes and an artier crowd; think ""Hero"" or ""The House of Flying Daggers"" only far less dramatic and with far less fanfare. The story, while fairly conventional, employs some storytelling touches that are more prevalent in modern films (the surprise situations that come about only because the main character is dreaming; the red-herrings that set you up to believe the story is about to go one way or will head one way only to go the other; the seemingly upside-down ending). The shooting locales and the visuals (while rarely expansive) are all stunning and expertly filmed. All of these things elevate ""Little Big Soldier"" and make it more than it probably ought to be. The movie is about Jackie Chan's seemingly deserting soldier who is not about being a soldier at all but about being a survivor. This is actually quite deceptive because Chan's soldier, while unorthodox, is a man of his army through-and-through but he is imbued with a mind of his own and a trickster spirit. The movie focuses heavily on Chan's character who ends up catching the general from the opposing army and he takes him, despite much trial and tribulation, back to his city. This movie is supposedly set at a time in China's history when there were several ruling (and warring) dynasties. It is about one man's take on life and how he passes this along to another, but both soldiers have some things to learn from each other.There is a lot to like in the movie. It goes down easy and is non-abrasive. Chan, still capable of putting on some fun action scenes, plays someone closer to his age and who is a bit weary so the action suits his character; he is not the Chan of old who is fighting Benny Urquidez or a slew of diamond-obsessed mobsters and thug-punk street gangs at a breakneck, frenetic pace. Chan also does what he has talked about doing for a long time: he acts. There are a couple of scenes that showcase Chan's acting chops and his character's warm pathos. I think that this is my favorite Chan film of the last 5 years (not counting ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" but having the dream of Chan and Li together after so many years...that just isn't fair to compare by). Chan fans and non-fans alike can easily enjoy this movie. The younger audience probably will too.",4,"Chan shines in this light, warm action-comedy period piece.",1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,2635,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'Chan', 'ouvre', 'was', 'watching', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'film', 'kept', 'thinking', 'myself', 'Wow', 'JC', 'film', 'modern', 'course', 'Chan', 'other', 'films', 'feel', 'modern', 'recent', 'American', 'fare', 'even', 'play', 'wide', 'audiences', 'are', 'conventional', 'Little', 'Big', 'Soldier', 'feels', 'more', 'major', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'release', 'appeals', 'regular', 'joes', 'artier', 'crowd', 'think', 'Hero', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'only', 'far', 'less', 'dramatic', 'far', 'less', 'fanfare', 'story', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'storytelling', 'touches', 'are', 'more', 'prevalent', 'modern', 'films', 'surprise', 'situations', 'come', 'only', 'main', 'character', 'dreaming', 'red-herrings', 'set', 'believe', 'story', 'go', 'one', 'way', 'will', 'head', 'one', 'way', 'only', 'go', 'other', 'seemingly', 'upside-down', 'ending', 'shooting', 'locales', 'visuals', 'rarely', 'expansive', 'are', 'stunning', 'expertly', 'filmed', 'things', 'elevate', 'Little', 'Big', 'Soldier', 'make', 'more', 'probably', 'ought', 'be', 'movie', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'seemingly', 'deserting', 'soldier', 'who', 'not', 'being', 'soldier', 'being', 'survivor', 'actually', 'quite', 'deceptive', 'Chan', 'soldier', 'unorthodox', 'man', 'army', 'through-and-through', 'imbued', 'mind', 'own', 'trickster', 'spirit', 'movie', 'heavily', 'Chan', 'character', 'who', 'up', 'catching', 'general', 'opposing', 'army', 'much', 'trial', 'tribulation', 'back', 'city', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'set', 'time', 'China', 'history', 'when', 'were', 'several', 'ruling', 'warring', 'dynasties', 'one', 'man', 'take', 'life', 'how', 'soldiers', 'have', 'things', 'learn', 'lot', 'like', 'movie', 'down', 'easy', 'non-abrasive', 'Chan', 'still', 'capable', 'putting', 'fun', 'action', 'scenes', 'someone', 'closer', 'age', 'who', 'bit', 'weary', 'action', 'suits', 'character', 'not', 'Chan', 'old', 'who', 'fighting', 'Benny', 'Urquidez', 'slew', 'diamond-obsessed', 'mobsters', 'thug-punk', 'street', 'gangs', 'breakneck', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'Chan', 'also', 'what', 'talked', 'doing', 'long', 'time', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'showcase', 'Chan', 'acting', 'chops', 'character', 'warm', 'pathos', 'think', 'favorite', 'Chan', 'film', 'last', '5', 'years', 'not', 'counting', 'Forbidden', 'Kingdom', 'having', 'dream', 'Chan', 'Li', 'together', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'just', ""n't"", 'fair', 'compare', 'Chan', 'fans', 'non-fans', 'alike', 'can', 'easily', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'younger', 'audience', 'probably', 'will', 'too']","Little Big Soldier (2010, Jackie Chan) Special Edition - DVD9"
