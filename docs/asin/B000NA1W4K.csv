What could have made it even better was more attention to either of the potential romantic couples: the black gang boy and his friends' sister or the young cop and the Hispanic gang leaders' girlfriend. More attention should have been given to either and one couple should have survived. The chemistry between the young cop and the Hispanic lady came to late in the movie. The chemistry between the black gangster and his friends' sister did not go anywhere. Blossoming love, even in a B-level zombie movie always adds to the quality. There was too much profanity. I love the fact that this zombie movie was in the ""hood"". I also liked the fact that the zombies looked more than like people with flour splashed on their face, but not their necks, and dark eye shadow painted on. The script was not the best, but this was one of the better zombie movies. I will definately watch this one again. With very little tweeking this one could have been a -4-.

1054985,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B000NA1W4K,David Girod,"[0, 2]","I have to give the film makers credit with ""Gangs of the Dead"". Whatever the budget was for this flick, they used every penny of it in the production. The special effects were pretty decent for a low budget flick, the director did some interesting things with the lighting to add suspense during certain scenes, and the acting wasn't bad either. They even sprung for genre horror favorite Reggie Bannister to make a cameo.On the down side, ""Gangs of the Dead"" is simply boring and a retread of multiple zombie flicks, only this time we get an urban setting. When a meteorite crashes into a group of bums it turns them into a ravenous pack of flesh eating zombies. In another part of the city, two rival gangs come to a run down warehouse in order to buy some weapons. The police are also on the scene in order to arrest the gangs and the arms dealer. Well before long the hungry zombies trap the gangs and some of the police officers in the warehouse, then it becomes a fight for survival.While the film makers did several things right, they did so many other things wrong. First, there are no likable characters. Who are we supposed to root for here? The gangbangers? Both gangs are filled with unlikable characters, and at times you will actually root for the living dead to begin feasting on these dimwitted wanna-be tough guys. The police? While I did get a chuckle out of seeing the LAPD attacking zombies with their nightsticks (in similar fashion to what we've all witnessed on so many news broadcasts) the police here are amazingly stupid and again you actually hope the zombies will form a buffet line. There is also a cowardly, nerdy wealthy white-guy weather man thrown into the mix which you can't care about either.Another problem I had with the film is that in the opening segments, when you first meet the ""heros"" of the film, they are cruising around town blasting some music...which is fine...except that any dialog uttered is buried under the music. They stop to pick up some girl...who is she? I don't know as the entire scene the is buried under the music. It's only quite a bit later in the film that we learn she is one of the gangbangers sisters.So while the film is a bit ambitious for a low budget zombie flick, it just isn't very good.",2,Zombies In Da Hood,1248998400,"07 31, 2009",2009,2261,"['have', 'give', 'film', 'makers', 'credit', 'Gangs', 'Dead', 'Whatever', 'budget', 'was', 'flick', 'used', 'penny', 'production', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'decent', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'director', 'did', 'interesting', 'things', 'lighting', 'add', 'suspense', 'certain', 'scenes', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'even', 'sprung', 'genre', 'horror', 'favorite', 'Reggie', 'Bannister', 'make', 'cameo.On', 'down', 'side', 'Gangs', 'Dead', 'simply', 'boring', 'retread', 'multiple', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'only', 'time', 'get', 'urban', 'setting', 'When', 'meteorite', 'crashes', 'group', 'bums', 'ravenous', 'pack', 'flesh', 'eating', 'zombies', 'part', 'city', 'two', 'rival', 'gangs', 'come', 'run', 'down', 'warehouse', 'order', 'buy', 'weapons', 'police', 'are', 'also', 'scene', 'order', 'arrest', 'gangs', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Well', 'long', 'hungry', 'zombies', 'trap', 'gangs', 'police', 'officers', 'warehouse', 'then', 'fight', 'survival.While', 'film', 'makers', 'did', 'several', 'things', 'right', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'wrong', 'First', 'are', 'likable', 'characters', 'Who', 'are', 'supposed', 'root', 'here', 'gangbangers', 'gangs', 'are', 'filled', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'times', 'will', 'actually', 'root', 'living', 'dead', 'begin', 'feasting', 'dimwitted', 'wanna-be', 'tough', 'guys', 'police', 'did', 'get', 'chuckle', 'seeing', 'LAPD', 'attacking', 'zombies', 'nightsticks', 'similar', 'fashion', 'what', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'so', 'many', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'police', 'here', 'are', 'amazingly', 'stupid', 'again', 'actually', 'hope', 'zombies', 'will', 'form', 'buffet', 'line', 'also', 'cowardly', 'nerdy', 'wealthy', 'white-guy', 'weather', 'man', 'thrown', 'mix', 'ca', ""n't"", 'care', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'opening', 'segments', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'heros', 'film', 'are', 'cruising', 'town', 'blasting', 'music', 'fine', 'dialog', 'uttered', 'buried', 'music', 'stop', 'pick', 'up', 'girl', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'entire', 'scene', 'buried', 'music', 'only', 'quite', 'bit', 'later', 'film', 'learn', 'one', 'gangbangers', 'sisters.So', 'film', 'bit', 'ambitious', 'low', 'budget', 'zombie', 'flick', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'good']",Gangs of the Dead

1054989,ABS2A1OWX5Q8,B000NA1W4K,Fred Adelman,"[0, 0]","GANGS OF THE DEAD (2005) - This is neither a good or bad zombie horror flick. It is what it is. Filmed under the title LAST RITES and also released as CITY OF THE DEAD in some foreign territories, this low-budget flick opens with a meteor containing alien spores hitting a bridge, where a homeless street preacher (Terrence Evans; THE PUMPKIN KARVER - 2006) is prophetizing the end of the world to his homeless flock. He was more right than he even realized. He and the rest of the homeless crowd are turned into flesh-hungry zombies and begin chowing down on every human they meet, including the wife of the local TV weatherman, who just happens to have the last name Weatherman (Cazimir Milostan). He hoofs it to a warehouse, where two gangs, a Black one and a Hispanic one are making a deal for weapons or drugs (it is never made clear) with supplier Mitchell (Reggie Bannister; PHANTASM - 1979, who has nothing more than an extended cameo). They are also being staked-out by the police outside, who decide to make the arrests, but the homeless zombies attack them and only two cops make it into the warehouse (Mitchell is hit by the police van, smashing him into bloody pieces). The two cops want everyone to put their differences aside and work together to get out of the warehouse, but Hispanic gang leader Caesar (Noel Gugliemi, listed in the credits simply as &#34;Noel G&#34;) will hear none of it and eventually becomes head douchebag in charge, killing one Black gang member by shooting him in the head (after the gang member dares him to pull the trigger!) and using everyone else as bait. What he doesn't know is one of the gang members is a snitch and that's why the police are there to begin with. The zombies begins to rip apart the cast one-by-one until only a few are left (Caesar suffers the bloodiest death and it is very well done), using a box of hand grenades to kill the rest of the zombies. They make it outside, only to discover more meteors hitting the skyscrapers of the city. Is there no hope left for humanity?  While there is some bloody gore that sometimes surpasses the film's R-rating, there is also some dodgy CGI, especially in the explosions (it is easy to differentiate real flames from CGI ones). Director/co-writer/co-producer Duane Stinnett (his only feature directorial effort at the time of this review) offers nothing new to the zombie genre and the screenplay, which he co-wrote with Krissann Shipley (who stars as Cassie, the female member of the Hispanic gang), makes some of the characters seem retarded, especially Latasha (Dayanah Jamine), the sister of one of the Black gang members, that you just want to strangle them. Sure, the film is stupid, badly acted and cheap as hell, but it is worth at least one viewing if you can't find anything better to watch. Also starring Howard Alonzo (listed simply as &#34;Howard&#34;), Ethan Ednee, Ryan King, Enrique Almeida, Danny Martinez, James C. Burns and Stephen Basilone (listed as &#34;Steve B.&#34;).

No one will be recommending this for any major awards, but this is a horror film, and if you want ""Oscar contender,"" before you can enjoy a horror movie, you're not really a horror fan.  But, if you've gotten past the film's title and cover art to this babble, you may be able to enjoy this thing.  Now, this isn't the best zombie film I've seen; in a way, it's just another low budget re-think on the ""Night of the Living Dead.""  And, while the zombies seem under represented (as in NOTLD), the zombies aren't supposed to be the stars, they simply provide the cause for the living, in a confined space, under stress, to reveal who they really are.  The character who really moves this story along is a very unlikable hard-as-they-come gangsta, who kills almost as many of the living as the zombies do.  However, his actions may also be what keeps this movie from being completely predictable. And you also probably wont be able to guess who's gonna die early, who's gonna last awhile or who, if anyone will survive.

This was just the final nail in a coffin sealed by such forgettable tripe as The Rage, Sigma Die!, Fallen Angels, and Wishmaster.Plot: you know how there was that one test you didn't study for in high school, and you spent the entire day until seventh period hoping the zombie apocalypse would happen and get you out of it? Yeah, it's kind of like that, except the &#8220;test&#8221; in question is a major drug deal where the cops have managed to score front-row tickets to a score that can put cuffs on big names from two huge rival gangs, or so they think, until the zombies show up. After that, it becomes just another run-from-the-zombies movie, indistinguishable from dozens of others, except in the places where most of those others are better.That, of course, is the problem with basement-budget horror films whose directors are out to make a quick buck&#8212;they're not putting any effort into thinking up something interesting to do with the story, the effects, anything. It's just a question of assembling the  various parts of a bunch of other movies in a slightly different order, troweling on some vaguely decomposed-looking makeup, and shooting something that can be stuck on a DVD and sold in one of those eighty-packs of low-budget horror movies you can find at Best Buy for twenty bucks. I guess, considering the source, I can't ask for much, but even with no-budget specials, you occasionally get a movie that really does something interesting with the script (Oxygen is a good example) or where the director at least cared enough to sift through until he found some really good actors to work with (Noctem).
