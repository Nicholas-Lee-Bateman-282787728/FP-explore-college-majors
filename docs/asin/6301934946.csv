Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Unknown Chaplin may be a long documentary clocking in at over two and one half hours; but the time flew by as I watched it, fascinated by Chaplin's outtakes and the discoveries the filmmakers made about Chaplin's true working techniques. The narration by James Mason is done with great sensitivity and respect; and the pace of the story is easily good enough to hold almost anyone's attention. The musical score is also very well done including music by Chaplin; and there is a minimal amount of time spent on Chaplin's personal life so that we can truly learn how this great mastermind worked.Chaplin was very secretive about his working techniques in his autobiographies; and no wonder--he might have been embarrassed to admit that he not only rehearsed with his other actors on film; he also filmed scenes many, many times just to get exactly what he wanted regardless of cost--and he didn't work from any script until very late in his career! This would be almost impossible today for financial reasons; but Chaplin didn't care what the cost was at that time; he wanted perfection and he almost always got it. The documentary is full of outtakes including his years at Mutual for which Chaplin did not own the rights; and this footage eventually made much of the documentary possible. We see how Chaplin weaved the story line along as he worked without a script; and the results are magnificent. I never would have guessed that he worked that way!The documentary is split into three parts: ""My Happiest Years;"" ""Hidden Treasures"" (with many more outtakes that had never seen the light of day except when Charlie himself viewed them once or maybe twice) and ""The Great Director."" We see how Chaplin was very demanding of himself and his actors even though many of them were actually his pals; and again the footage is terrific.It may seem as if I've given the whole thing away; but I assure you I haven't. Even if I had given it all away, you would still be awed by the footage this film provides. It's excellent! There are also interviews with people who worked with Chaplin on some of his greatest films including ""The Kid"" and ""City Lights."" Virginia Cherrill, Jackie Coogan, Lita Grey and Georgia Hale and others all reminisce about working with Chaplin and Chaplin as an artist; and that's grand.There may be some who will say that since Chaplin wanted much of this footage destroyed that this documentary is disrespectful of him and his wishes--and they have a point. On the other hand, however, it's equally true that you'll love watching this great master working so hard to make outstanding, classic films that are very special even in our times.The DVD comes with a few bonuses; there's a commentary by one of the filmmakers and I especially liked ""The Making of The Count.""Unknown Chaplin is essential for any Chaplin fan or any fan of silent cinema; film buffs and historians would also do well to get this for their collections.",5,fine documentary about one of the greatest artists ever,1290038400,"11 18, 2010",2010,2944,"['Unknown', 'Chaplin', 'may', 'be', 'long', 'documentary', 'clocking', 'two', 'one', 'half', 'hours', 'time', 'flew', 'watched', 'fascinated', 'Chaplin', 'outtakes', 'discoveries', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'Chaplin', 'true', 'working', 'techniques', 'narration', 'James', 'Mason', 'done', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'respect', 'pace', 'story', 'easily', 'good', 'enough', 'hold', 'almost', 'anyone', 'attention', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'including', 'music', 'Chaplin', 'minimal', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'Chaplin', 'personal', 'life', 'so', 'can', 'truly', 'learn', 'how', 'great', 'mastermind', 'worked.Chaplin', 'was', 'very', 'secretive', 'working', 'techniques', 'autobiographies', 'wonder', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'embarrassed', 'admit', 'not', 'only', 'rehearsed', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'also', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'just', 'get', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'regardless', 'cost', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'script', 'very', 'late', 'career', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'impossible', 'today', 'financial', 'reasons', 'Chaplin', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'cost', 'was', 'time', 'wanted', 'perfection', 'almost', 'always', 'got', 'documentary', 'full', 'outtakes', 'including', 'years', 'Mutual', 'Chaplin', 'did', 'not', 'own', 'rights', 'footage', 'eventually', 'made', 'much', 'documentary', 'possible', 'see', 'how', 'Chaplin', 'weaved', 'story', 'line', 'worked', 'script', 'results', 'are', 'magnificent', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'worked', 'way', 'documentary', 'split', 'three', 'parts', 'Happiest', 'Years', 'Hidden', 'Treasures', 'many', 'more', 'outtakes', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'when', 'Charlie', 'viewed', 'once', 'maybe', 'twice', 'Great', 'Director', 'see', 'how', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'very', 'demanding', 'actors', 'even', 'many', 'were', 'actually', 'pals', 'again', 'footage', 'terrific.It', 'may', 'seem', ""'ve"", 'given', 'whole', 'thing', 'away', 'assure', 'have', ""n't"", 'Even', 'had', 'given', 'away', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'awed', 'footage', 'film', 'excellent', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'Chaplin', 'greatest', 'films', 'including', 'Kid', 'City', 'Lights', 'Virginia', 'Cherrill', 'Jackie', 'Coogan', 'Lita', 'Grey', 'Georgia', 'Hale', 'others', 'reminisce', 'working', 'Chaplin', 'Chaplin', 'artist', 'grand.There', 'may', 'be', 'who', 'will', 'say', 'Chaplin', 'wanted', 'much', 'footage', 'destroyed', 'documentary', 'disrespectful', 'wishes', 'have', 'point', 'other', 'hand', 'however', 'equally', 'true', ""'ll"", 'love', 'watching', 'great', 'master', 'working', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'outstanding', 'classic', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'special', 'even', 'times.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'bonuses', 'commentary', 'one', 'filmmakers', 'especially', 'liked', 'Making', 'Count', 'Unknown', 'Chaplin', 'essential', 'Chaplin', 'fan', 'fan', 'silent', 'cinema', 'film', 'buffs', 'historians', 'would', 'also', 'do', 'well', 'get', 'collections']",Unknown Chaplin Collection VHS

All the more impressive when one understands that the &quot;out-takes&quot; referred to in other reviews were supposed to be destroyed!  Chaplin filmed his rehersals and played them back later, watching to see how jokes worked best. At times he'd do over a hundred takes until he had the gag worked out the way he wanted.  Today, with video that doesn't seem like a big deal, but for him to film it all was an extremely large investment made by a true comic artist.  After the film was complete, Chaplin ordered all this extra footage burned.  Only because someone disobeyed did this material survive to be seen today.Another great feature of this set (along with Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow and Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius) is interviews with surviving co-workers who share their personal memories of Chaplin.  Even during the time between the Chaplin and the Lloyd series, many of those interviewed had passed away. Recreating this documentary today would be impossible.

273518,A37S3ACL57LN62,6301934946,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[4, 4]","Unknown Chaplin is an excellent three part documentary about the parts of Charlie Chaplin's career that are not well known to the public. Film-makers Kevin Brownlow and David Gill became aware of rare film footage from Chaplin's archive and came up with the idea to make a documentary of it. They discovered ample evidence of the genius's filming techniques including scenes of him directing and creating gags on film.The first episode delves into what are known as Chaplin's ""happiest years,"" the ones making Mutual comedies. During this time, he was able to do everything behind the camera. He was a director as well as an actor and he contributed greatly to the stories and pacing of the films. We also learn a bit about his relationship with Edna Purviance, his leading lady for 8 years. The second bit focuses heavily on two major accomplishments in Chaplin's career, The Gold Rush and City Lights. Here we see interviews with his leading ladies Georgia Hale and Virginia Cherrill to gain insight into the man and his methods. The last segment rediscovers the artist through outtakes and rare clips. We see a very funny cut scene from City Lights as well as other interesting moments.Also included on this disk are two fascinating bits for film historians. We hear Brownlow's story of the making of these documentaries, a very interesting but disappointingly short segment. Next is The Making of The Count, a dissection of how Chaplin made the film. Both are excellent supplements to a wonderful show. If you find yourself wondering why Chaplin gets so much attention in the history books, watch this film.

273519,A3M2WW0PO34B94,6301934946,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[55, 56]","I remember sitting in front of my television, rapturously watching the documentary ""Hollywood"" created by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill in 1980. Each of the 13 segments dealing with a specific part of early Hollywood history, played on PBS and was a true delight. In this era before DVD, and even VHS, it was a great way to see a large number of rare clips from the Silent era. A few years later, they made ""Unknown Chaplin"", perhaps the most astonishing documentary ever created about the technical side of Hollywood. A few years later, ""Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow"" continued the tradition.""Unknown Chaplin"" was just released on DVD and is a must have addition for anyone even remotely interested in the history of film or filmmaking.During production of ""Hollywood"", Brownlow and Gill naturally wanted to devote an entire hour to Chaplin but ran into a roadblock. The person who controlled access to Chaplin's work was only prepared to let them use a ""snippet"". They had to change their plans. They couldn't build an entire hour around a ""snippet"". After ""Hollywood"" aired, to great critical acclaim, they tried again. Chaplin's widow allowed them access to his personal vault. What they found there astonished them; row after row of film cans, many labeled with ""City Lights"", ""The Gold Rush"", ""The Circus"" and many with unfamiliar names. These contained clips never before seen, projects started but never finished and rehearsals for films like ""City Lights"". It was a treasure trove for any film historian.Naturally, they believed they had just hit the mother load, but soon met a man named Raymond Rohauer. Rohauer, a film ""collector"", claimed to have many reels of film from Chaplin's Mutual days, the period immediately before Chaplin went independent and began to make his great feature-length films. The Mutual period is considered by many to be Chaplin's best, when he made his most famous two-reelers, ""The Immigrant"", ""The Cure"" and others along with ""The Kid"". As they viewed this footage, Brownlow and Gill made a major realization;  Chaplin worked out all of his films on the set, while the cameras were rolling, providing a visual history of his work. Beginning with a bare outline he would began production, working out jokes on set, adding jokes, changing stories, and more. Sometimes, he would scrap everything and start over. Or get an idea and change everything around. And the camera was always running while he did this.""Unknown Chaplin"" premiered in 1983 to great critical acclaim, exposing many to the methods used by one of film's greatest comedians and most skilled directors. Imagine having the ability to watch Claude Monet create a canvas and get insight into the various decisions he made. Or to watch Frank Lloyd Wright work on his latest design and see why he decided to put that piece of word there. This is what ""Unknown Chaplin"" provides, access into the mind of a master.Recently released on DVD for the first time, each of the three segments of ""Unknown"" look amazingly vivid and clear. Some of the better footage is so clear it looks like it was photographed yesterday. As James Mason narrates, guiding us, we begin to learn how Chaplin created his films. Every time I say this, I just get chills up and down my spine. How often can we expect to see a master, someone at the top of their craft, creating some of their most famous work? Considering how much of the Silent era was destroyed, the fact that this film exists at all is all the more impressive.Part One is the most groundbreaking, presenting the footage from the Mutual days. Brownlow and Gill quickly realized that Chaplin filmed every take and frequently changed bits between takes. How should they deal with this wealth of material? They decided to arrange the clips in chronological order, recreating how Chaplin worked on the material as the cameras rolled. He began each project with an outline, but this is by no means how the projects were completed. He would work out the jokes and funny business on set, sometimes running into road blocks. If he couldn't work through it, he would scrap everything and start over. We get to see this process as we watch these clips unearthed by the filmmakers.Part Two presents the material obtained from Chapin's vaults, after he became independent and began making feature length films. Less extensive, the footage still reveals a lot. For instance, a family friend stood near the camera and was able to take home movies as Chaplin worked on ""City Lights"". This footage is shown, and we get a glimpse of Chaplin, the director, at work. We also watch as Chaplin works through various location problems with ""The Gold Rush"", unused footage from ""The Circus"" and more.Part Three shows us the unseen clips, portions of abandoned projects, unseen shorts and more Brownlow and Gill found in the Chaplin vaults. After Chaplin built his own studio, many dignitaries and famous people stopped by and the director filmed these visits, sometimes making quick shorts with them, on existing sets. If he did any funny business during these impromptu films, he frequently incorporated this into later works. He even started a few projects that were never finished, one of which shows Charlie as a down-on-his-luck `Professor' who owns a flea circus, temporarily abandoning his Tramp character.""Unknown Chaplin"" is a documentary almost solely devoted to the filmmaker's work. The few references to his personal life are made because they somehow affected his professional work. Because of this ""Unknown"" presents one of the most thorough, interesting and illuminating looks at one of film's true masters and true pioneers.",5,Chaplin at Work,1136764800,"01 9,

273520,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6301934946,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","Charlie Chaplin was very secretive about the way he worked, his biography generalising his methods almost to the point of obscurity, making this 1983 documentary from the makers of the classic Hollywood TV series and compiled from Chaplin's archive of out-takes one of the most important pieces of cinematic archaeology ever produced. Deleted scenes and post-edit point footage (when the camera continues to roll for a few seconds after the action has finished to allow the editor leeway) throw light on his approach as Chaplin is seen losing his temper, breaking up with laughter and, most revealingly, looking on with mounting disappointment at an uninspired actor in an out-take from The Immigrant.Following an uncomfortable introduction by Geraldine Chaplin, the first episode deals with his two-reelers for Mutual and has the lion's share of the rediscovered footage but no interviews, since there were no living survivors of the period at the time the series was made.Working with no script but a basic idea, Chaplin used the props and sets as a springboard, rehearsing on film, and it is the out-takes that show how he would chisel away at an idea until he found something that would work, constantly refining it. The highlights of the first episode are the development of The Cure and, particularly, The Immigrant, both of which started out very differently to the finished product.Some of the scenes were cut for obvious reasons, but there are gems along the way, such as Charlie playing traffic cop with wheelchairs in The Cure. There are also plenty of good ideas that went wrong, such as the dance of the cleaning ladies from Behind the Screen: elaborately staged sequences that were cut, such as a joke involving a real axe from the same short and a special effects sequence using double-exposure to have two Doc Stones in the same shot.The second episode has the bonus of several interviews: Dean Reisner (the irritating child from The Pilgrim), Jackie Coogan (the child star of The Kid and, in later years, Uncle Fester in The Addams Family), director Robert Parrish (who played a child newsboy in City Lights), Lita Grey (the child actress in The Kid who became Chaplin's child bride), Georgia Hale (who replaced her in The Gold Rush and, subsequently in Chaplin's affections) and Virginia Cherrill (the blind girl in City Lights).He would frequently call off production, reshoot with different actors and sometimes take months on a single scene. The show provides a striking example in the sequence where the Tramp meets the blind Flower Girl in City Lights, seen in home movie footage of Chaplin directing: by the 534th day of filming, only 166 days had been spent working against 368 idle, making Stanley Kubrick look speedy by comparison. There's also footage of Churchill's visit to the set and a fascinating reshot ending with The Gold Rush's Georgia Hale after he fired Virginia Cherrill.The third episode is the thinnest, but has ample compensations. There is footage of Chaplin guest conducting the Abe Lyman orchestra in 1923, doing the dance of the bread rolls at a party, out-takes from a short he made with Harry Lauder to raise money for wounded British soldiers and some fascinating demonstrations of how his on-camera fooling around with visitors to his studio sparked ideas that would be fully reworked into later films. Chaplin had a mind like an attic - he might discard ideas, but he would never throw them away, as is demonstrated by The Idle Class, which grew out of a (much funnier) abandoned Mutual short with Albert Austin.The highlights of the final episode are The Professor, an abortive attempt to get away from the Tramp character that saw Chaplin in Eric Campbell-style bushy eyebrows as a flea circus act forced onto hard times and losing his performers in a doss house; the original opening sequences from Modern Times (both rather drawn out); and, best of all, a full nine minutes from The Circus, later described by Chaplin as the most miserable experience of his life, including a scene in which Charlie tries to learn tightrope walking on a rake and a hysterically funny sequence with some fish. There are the domestic scenes cut from Shoulder Arms because distributors wanted a short rather than another feature.The picture quality is very good indeed, although, perversely, due to the decades of duping, the extracts from the finished films are of vastly inferior quality to the out-takes (sadly, the extras give a hint of why this is - because of legal wrangles with Raymond Rohauer that stretched on for years, much of the material was never preserved on film because a deal couldn't be made: when it finally was years later, much of the material was beyond preservation). With narration by James Mason underlining the quality of the series, this is easily one of the most fascinating and unusual film documentaries ever produced, and comes very highly recommended. There's also a small but sweet extras package of out-takes from The Count, Chaplin's own gfootage of a visit to the set of A Dog's Life by Scottish comedian Harry Lauder and an interview with Kevin Brownlow.",5,One of the finest film history documentaries ever made,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,5129,"['Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'very', 'secretive', 'way', 'worked', 'biography', 'generalising',
