The likely suspect is tehir new bible-thumping neighbor, son of the local fundamentalist preacher, who had recently made anti-gay taunts against them, and has a history of homophobic acts.  Robbie cannot believe that the police refuse to just arrest him based on the recent verbal bashing and implied threat, and works with friends to try to push the police into action.A relatively low-budget indie first film by writer/producer/director Tommy Stovall, who managed to attract a mostly-experienced cast of actors who made the rather simplistic screenplay seem a lot better than it really is.  Bruce Davidson is riveting as the fundamentalist preacher, and Seth Peterson shows considerable range as Robbie.  The musical score is also impressive, including several new songs by writer/artist Ebony Tay.  Personally, I was a bit turned off by the ""Fight violence and hate with more violence and hate"" message conveyed, though it could be commendable that it illustrates that gay men are not content to simply be victims.

That idyllic picture quickly changes, however, with the arrival of an inhospitable new neighbor. Christopher Boyd, son of the local fundamentalist pastor, immediately goes out of his way to vehemently demean the two men and warns Robbie to watch his back because he's ""going to hell."" Following a viciously unprovoked attack that leaves Trey lying comatose in a hospital bed, Robbie endeavors to fill the unbearable void left in his life and seek justice.Director Tommy Stovall has crafted a bold, hard-hitting slice of reality. Any one person who, upon watching ""Hate Crime,"" can still come away quoting it as a ""cheap jab at religion"" that promotes the so-called ""Gay Agenda"" is plain and simply beyond hope. Prejudice is prejudice, no matter how you choose to approach it. The fact that some members of society still choose to justify blatant acts of violence as ""God's will"" represents the sole reason I feel this outstanding film should be required viewing.This has everything. Tight scripting, fine acting by a strong cast of professionals, and an unflinching look at the heart-wrenching pain intolerance can breed. My spouse and I were both extremely moved and impressed with what Mr. Stovall brought to the table.

1018699,AF3L7GVC6T94P,B000I2J6Y6,Geminiguy,"[7, 8]","There is a very effective scene in ""Hate Crime"" that conveys one of the problems with religion in general... it is inconsistent. The scene plays out as one pastor preaches to the congregation about Gods love and acceptance of for everyone while another pastor spews the bitter message of Gods hate... simultaneously. It is one of the key factors that makes this movie better than I expected it to be.This is the story about hatred and how hatred can tear a person's (or people's) world apart. But what this film elevates with its exploration of hate is the hate spread using God and the bible. In fact, the story in some ways resembles a real life Church... run by the Reverand Jerry Fallwell.I can't say much without ruining the story for those who have not seen it yet, but I can say that the acting was solid across the board (Davidon and Shaye were superbly convincing in their powerful and in some ways, devastating roles) and the story moved at a decent pace. It was a tad predictable but this story is not really intended as a ""who-done-it"" so much as it is a ""Why'd-they-do-it"" . The characters that were the primary focus were developed rather intricately and caring for them in their situation was not hard to do. So, for the most part this is a really good movie.There are only two flaws that I can pinpoint... the believability of some of the situations. Actions went a little over the top and some characters where merely charicatures of the stereotypes you'd expect. The police investigation through out the movie was sloppily developed and at times, the actions of a certain detective seemed a little ""off"". Also, the editing of the film seemed to resemble a ""Lifetime"" movie (not in content... just in style) and at times it seemed a little choppy. That said, the ""flashback"" sequence that reveals the atrosity of the violence was quite riveting and a little uncomfortable to watch as it didn't hold back.This is a ""thinking persons"" thriller, not because you really have to figure anything out, but because it raises the question... what would you do?Solid, affecting, sad, and insightful... this one's a keeper.",4,A thriller that goes right for the throat of hipocracy...,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,2129,"['very', 'effective', 'scene', 'Hate', 'Crime', 'conveys', 'one', 'problems', 'religion', 'general', 'inconsistent', 'scene', 'out', 'one', 'pastor', 'congregation', 'Gods', 'love', 'acceptance', 'everyone', 'pastor', 'bitter', 'message', 'Gods', 'hate', 'simultaneously', 'one', 'key', 'factors', 'movie', 'better', 'expected', 'be.This', 'story', 'hatred', 'how', 'hatred', 'can', 'tear', 'person', 'people', 'world', 'apart', 'what', 'film', 'exploration', 'hate', 'hate', 'spread', 'using', 'God', 'bible', 'fact', 'story', 'ways', 'resembles', 'real', 'life', 'Church', 'run', 'Reverand', 'Jerry', 'Fallwell.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'ruining', 'story', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'can', 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'solid', 'board', 'Davidon', 'Shaye', 'were', 'superbly', 'convincing', 'powerful', 'ways', 'devastating', 'roles', 'story', 'moved', 'decent', 'pace', 'was', 'tad', 'predictable', 'story', 'not', 'really', 'intended', 'who-done-it', 'so', 'much', ""Why'd-they-do-it"", 'characters', 'were', 'primary', 'focus', 'were', 'developed', 'rather', 'intricately', 'caring', 'situation', 'was', 'not', 'hard', 'do', 'So', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'good', 'movie.There', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'flaws', 'can', 'pinpoint', 'believability', 'situations', 'Actions', 'went', 'little', 'top', 'characters', 'where', 'merely', 'stereotypes', ""'d"", 'expect', 'police', 'investigation', 'movie', 'was', 'sloppily', 'developed', 'times', 'actions', 'certain', 'detective', 'seemed', 'little', 'Also', 'editing', 'film', 'seemed', 'resemble', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'not', 'content', 'just', 'style', 'times', 'seemed', 'little', 'choppy', 'said', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'atrosity', 'violence', 'was', 'quite', 'riveting', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back.This', 'thinking', 'persons', 'thriller', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'figure', 'anything', 'out', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'Solid', 'affecting', 'sad', 'insightful', 'one', 'keeper']",Hate Crime

1018701,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000I2J6Y6,Grady Harp,"[12, 13]","Tommy Stovall makes a stunning debut as a writer and director for the very insightful, sensitive, and courageous film HATE CRIME. It is difficult to believe that this is his first attempt at cinematic communication, the film just works that well.Robbie Levinson (Seth Peterson) and Trey McCoy (Brian J. Smith) have been in a successful relationship for six years, complete with home, cute and devoted dog, supportive parents and siblings, and especially funky supportive neighbor Kathleen Slansky (a major turn for veteran character actress Lin Shaye).  They are approaching their commitment ceremony and even talking about adopting children when the sky darkens with the moving in of next door neighbor Chris Boyd (Chad Donella), a stormy right wing bible-thumping homophobe who catches a glimpse of Robbie's and Trey's affection.  When Trey is walking their dog in the park one evening he is beaten severely with a baseball bat: the obvious suspect is neighbor Chris.Kathleen warns Robbie that justice will never be achieved in the hands of the law and sets of a sense of revenge in Robbie's mind.  Trey lies in a coma in the hospital while his mother (a superb Cindy Pickett) is shaken not only form her only son's tenuous condition but also from her recovering alcoholic husband's (Sean Hennigan) flat affect and continued lack of communication.  A fine young detective Elizabeth Fisher (Farah White) does what she can to attempt to gather the shaky facts of evidence of Chris' guilt, but is thwarted by the entry of Detective Esposito (Giancarlo Esposito) who has homophobic issues of his own.Chris' father, Pastor Boyd (Bruce Davison) rants from his pulpit that all sinners - especially fornicators - must be punished by God and Chris supports his father's preachings and actions, as does his beautiful bimbo mother Martha (Susan Blakely).  As facts are found and everyone surrounding Trey's beating is suspect, the story gathers momentum in the true fashion of the best detective mysteries.  Dark secrets appear from every corner and eventually the crime is 'resolved', but not without many surprises as to the perpetrator and the motivation.The entire cast is excellent from the leading roles to the cameos and Stovall keeps the pace at a breathtaking speed.  Yes, there are some gaping holes in the script, giving us the feeling that Stovall had to pare down his story to the 104 minutes it takes. But what he does accomplish is a masterly look at strident right wing religious views of gays while balancing those with compassionate religious views by the more moderate and love-oriented factions. He raises a lot of issues, leaves many concepts unresolved intentionally, and draws performances from his committed cast that rank with the finest.  This is a film that SHOULD be viewed by a wide audience.  Highly recommended.

1018702,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B000I2J6Y6,James Morris,"[81, 84]","It is so seldom that a film tears directly at your gut that you forget from one such experience to the next just how involving and emotionally gripping a movie can really be.  At the same time, it is unusual to find a suspense film that manages to keep you guessing and maintain your interest up to the conclusion of whatever puzzle a filmmaker has set up, especially when you've seen as many suspense films as I have.  And it is genuinely thrilling to find a motion picture that can make you question your own values, or even incite you to approve of things you might not ordinarily condone.Normally, I would be happy to find a movie that presents any of these merits, but for a film to embody all of these characteristics?  I thought such a movie couldn't exist.  Then I watched Hate Crime, and was utterly blown away.Perhaps it's because, as a gay man, I identified wholly with the young, amiable same-sex couple in this film.  Perhaps it's because I am sick of arguing with ""well-intentioned"" people of ""faith"", who think they know better than I do what course my life should take.  Or perhaps it is because, I must admit, I think that fanatic religious fundamentalists - of whatever persuasion - are just about the most wholly evil and hypocritical people on the face of the earth.  Whatever.  All I know is, this picture hit me right in the chops, and kept right on hitting me until I thought couldn't take any more.Robbie and Trey are a gay couple who have all the pluses.  They live in a comfortable home, their union is accepted by their parents, their neighbors and family love them, and they are about to have a commitment ceremony.  Suddenly, into their lives comes a new neighbor.  The son of a Fundamentalist preacher moves in next door, and makes it plain that he does not approve of gay men.  Within a few weeks, Trey is assaulted with a baseball bat while walking their dog, and abruptly their picture-perfect lives are shattered by the full force of unadulterated bigotry.What happens next had me alternately crying, cringing, guessing at the next plot turn and sitting on the edge of my seat or applauding.  I found myself doing all of these things several times, while being amazed that these emotions and reactions were all prompted by scenes in the same film, and sometimes within moments of each other.  As this is a ""suspense"" film, I do not want to reveal too many details, but let me comment on just a few aspects of Hate Crime that I especially liked.Although predictable to a point, the plot does not unfold as neatly as you would think.  The narrative twists several ways, and I marveled at writer / director Tommy Stovall's ability to make me shake with fury one moment and feel supremely satisfied the next, only to find the story moving in places I wasn't sure I wanted it to go.  The acting was all first rate, the direction taut and crisp and the details credible and as up to the minute as the lead story on the ten o'clock news.  Even better, there were two or three scenes that I, as a gay man, found so wholly satisfying, that I was amazed the film dared to go there.  One in particular was a scene where the screen alternates between a fire-and-brimstone sermon by Bruce Davison as the father of the lead homophobe, and a loving, life-affirming prayer service by a congregation devastated by the unspeakable violence in their midst.  The contrast was there for all to see; the loving, forgiving healing God of the moderates versus the punishing, vindictive, fire-and-brimstone God of the hypocrites.  Undeniable in its candor, I wish I could show that scene to everyone, everywhere.Even more satisfying was a literal ""slap in the face"" to the wife of the preacher, who suggests that the hate crime victim made himself a target by his ""lifestyle choice"".  Again, I've never seen a film quite go to the places this one did, and I have to admit it was a guilty pleasure.Certain details were very hard to digest, not because they weren't plausible (and there were some stretches, I admit), but because I found myself feeling uncomfortable with the emotions and conflicts they evoked.  Particularly difficult for me was the ""revenge"" aspect.  I have always been against ""vigilante"" justice; no matter what cause or reason, I don't believe anyone can take the law into their own hands.  In Hate Crime, the victim tries desperately to gain some satisfaction through legal means, and finding none, goes to great lengths to entrap the perpetrator into confessing, and only after all else fails, the guilty party is punished in a manner that is justly fitting.  Hate Crime leaves no doubt that the murderer is guilty of a heinous, capitol crime, for which he may never otherwise be brought to justice.  Even though I still do not approve of vigilantism, I must admit the revenge aspect of Hate Crime felt damn good.  In order to underscore the justice of the climax, the hate crime is shown in a graphic, bloody scene that many will find hard to take, and the depravity of the killer is such that I found myself rooting for the exact conclusion proffered by the filmmaker, even against my own instincts and values.  At the end, I was exhausted and shaken, and knocked over by the sheer, stomach-retching drama of it all.There are those who will not like this film.  It is of course ""controversial"" to suggest that a person who is a ""servant of God"" could be a liar and a hypocrite and a murderer.  There are probably those who will decry it as mockery of ""True Believers"" and a few who will claim this film is a veritable tool of the devil.Let them think what they want.  I haven't been so entertained, so moved, so outraged or so satisfied by a film in a long, long time.

1018703,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B000I2J6Y6,J. Martin,"[3, 3]","SPOILER ALERT: I'm going to write exclusively about the ending of this movie and the controversy it stirs up. Although I always want to know as much as possible about a movie before I watch it, including how it ends, evidently most people don't. I'm warning anybody who doesn't like spoilers not to read this review.Some reviewers are disturbed by the ending, feeling that the heroes make themselves no better than the villains. But the killings of Trey and Pastor Boyd were completely different, so it's a mistake to say Robbie and Trey's mom ended up being no better than the pastor. The pastor deserved to die; Trey didn't. The method in which they killed the pastor was also infinitely more merciful--a quick gunshot to the head, having let him know exactly why they were doing it, instead of a brutal full-body beating with a baseball bat, in the dark and without warning, while the guy was out walking his little dog. What the pastor did was an act of cowardice and hatred; what they did was an act of justice and courage.I think people who have a problem with the ending may be bound so tightly to political correctness that they've lost sight of humanity. A profound need for justice, and indignation at injustice, are very strong, perfectly natural, normal and healthy human traits. The ideal of righteous revenge for unspeakable and unpunished wrongs has been a powerful force throughout history and in every medium of human expression, and it's been in the movies since they started.I absolutely LOVED seeing a gay guy and (even better) his lover's mom take revenge the way they did, with guts, determination, and intelligence, and getting away with it. Revenge stories are often messy, and rarely logical, because they appeal to the gut, not to the intellect. They always involve taking the law into your own hands. They always involve taking an eye for an eye. They can NEVER be politically correct, but they can be extraordinarily satisfying.This movie is one of the best. If it had ended any other way, I'd have despised it. As it is, it's one of the most deeply rewarding and satisfying movies--on very many levels, both aesthetic and personal--I've ever seen in my life.",5,SPOILER: The Perfect Ending,1243987200,"06 3, 2009",2009,2187,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', ""'m"", 'going', 'write', 'exclusively', 'ending', 'movie', 'controversy', 'up', 'always', 'want', 'know', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'movie', 'watch', 'including', 'how', 'evidently', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'warning', 'anybody', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'spoilers', 'not', 'read', 'review.Some', 'reviewers', 'are', 'disturbed', 'ending', 'feeling', 'heroes', 'make', 'better', 'villains', 'killings', 'Trey', 'Pastor', 'Boyd', 'were', 'completely', 'different', 'mistake', 'say', 'Robbie', 'Trey', 'mom', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'better', 'pastor', 'pastor', 'deserved', 'die', 'Trey', 'did', ""n't"", 'method', 'killed', 'pastor', 'was', 'also', 'infinitely', 'more', 'merciful', 'quick', 'gunshot', 'head', 'having', 'let', 'know', 'exactly', 'why', 'were', 'doing', 'instead', 'brutal', 'full-body', 'beating', 'baseball', 'bat', 'dark', 'warning', 'guy', 'was', 'out', 'walking', 'little', 'dog', 'What', 'pastor', 'did', 'was', 'act', 'cowardice', 'hatred', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'act', 'justice', 'courage.I', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'problem', 'ending', 'may', 'be', 'bound', 'so', 'tightly', 'political', 'correctness', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'sight', 'humanity', 'profound', 'need', 'justice', 'indignation', 'injustice', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'normal', 'healthy', 'human', 'traits', 'ideal', 'righteous', 'revenge', 'unspeakable', 'unpunished', 'wrongs', 'been', 'powerful', 'force', 'history', 'medium', 'human', 'expression', 'been', 'movies', 'started.I', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', 'seeing', 'gay', 'guy', 'even', 'better', 'lover', 'mom', 'take', 'revenge', 'way', 'did', 'guts', 'determination', 'intelligence', 'getting', 'away', 'Revenge', 'stories', 'are', 'often', 'messy', 'rarely', 'logical', 'appeal', 'gut', 'not', 'intellect', 'always', 'involve', 'taking', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'always', 'involve', 'taking', 'eye', 'eye', 'can', 'NEVER', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'can', 'be', 'extraordinarily', 'satisfying.This', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'had', 'ended', 'other', 'way', ""'d"", 'have', 'despised', 'one', 'most', 'deeply', 'rewarding', 'satisfying', 'movies', 'very', 'many', 'levels', 'aesthetic', 'personal', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life']",Hate Crime

Brokeback Mountain left me cold, due to the lack of a backstory, its origin as a flimsy short story, its superficial script and the total lack of a sense of outrage. If you feel the same way, here is the antidote.First, I disagree with the reviewer who called this film ""pat."" Bigots and bullies are not complex creatures, they are simply sociopaths with rotten childhoods (and often psychopaths). Why is it that those who most loudly invoke Jesus (or other religious icon), and take the Bible (or other scripture) most literally, embody nothing of the teachings of their religious leader? Remember what Jesus said: ""Even as you do it to the least of these, you do it unto me."" So when a person commits gay bashing, rape, bullying, genocide, an act of racism or child abuse (or any other violent crime), it is as though it was done to Christ. But bigots don't see it that way...A gay couple - a veterinarian and an accountant - is celebrating six years of being together in a happy relationship filled with love and nurturing. They do not hate, are polite, accomplished, giving, show respect for others, and are optimists. Enter an angry, troubled fundamentalist bigot who wastes no time condemning them and telling them they are ""going to hell."" Shortly thereafter the relationship is shattered when the blond vet is brutally beaten with a baseball bat while walking his dog at night, and soon bleeds to death in his hospital bed. The bulk of the film centers around how the parents, in-laws and friends of the victim deal with finding and punishing the the perpetrator of this grisly, cowardly act.You are continually kept guessing. Everything in this film is excellent, from script and acting to photography and music. Whatever you think of gays or other minorities, this film seeks to ensure that you are never indifferent again to the outrage of violence. Regrettably there are some people who will not care about violence to others, because for them everything in life ""is only about me.""Remember the story of the man who saw his friends and neighbors systematically taken away. He did nothing because he didn't want to get involved. But then he adds... ""And then they came for me.""
