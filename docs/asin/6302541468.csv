319369,AGEIT17HENDIS,6302541468,Alfred Johnson,"[3, 4]","Let's start this review of this documentary of the incidents surrounding the case of Leonard Peltier, convicted of the 1975 murder, execution-style, of two FBI agents on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota after he had been extradited from Canada in the wake of the acquittal of two other Pine Ridge residents, at the end. Or at least the end of this documentary, 1991. In an interview from federal prison in that period the then still relatively young Peltier related that after receiving his life sentences and being told by prison officials that that meant that his release date would be in 2035 he stated that he hoped not, for he would then be an old, old man. Well, and here is what should make every one interested in the case, and everyone interested in the least sense of justice, even just bourgeois justice, blood boil, he is now an old sick man and he is still in jail for a crime that he did not commit, and certainly one that was not proven beyond that cherished ""reasonable doubt""This documentary, narrated by Robert Redford in his younger days as well, goes step by step through the case from the pre-murder period when Native Americans, catching the political consciousness crest begun in the 1960s by the black civil rights movement and the anti-Vietnam war movement, started organizing, mainly through the American Indian Movement (AIM), on the Indian reservations of the West, some of the most impoverished areas in all the Americas, through to the then still pending appeals process. The focal point of this militant organizing effort came in the war zone-showdown, the siege at Wounded Knee in 1973. The tension that hovered in the air in the aftermath of that war between the American government and its Indian agent supporters on one side, and the AIMled ""warrior nation"" on the other is the setting for this incident at Ogala.Through reenactment of the crime scene; eye witnesses, interested and disinterested,  voluntary or coerced; defense strategies at both trials from self-defense to lack of physical evidence, and on appeal; the prosecution's case, its insufficient evidence,  and it various maneuvers to inflame white juries against unpopular or misunderstood Native Americans in order to get someone convicted for the murders of their own; the devastating, but expected effect of the trials on the political organizing by AIM; and the stalwart and defiant demeanor of one Leonard Peltier all come though in this presentation. As a long time supporter of organizations that defend class-war prisoners, like Leonard Peltier, this film only makes that commitment even firmer.

The movie is slightly biased in favor of Leonard Peltier an AIM member who was tried and convicted of the 2 murders. (It was biased toward him--but rightfully so.) This movie gives good insight to the tensions and history of ""civil war"" on the reservation during the 70s and 80s. They provide convincing evidence that Peltier was not given a fair trial and that the FBI bullied and falsified evidence to get a conviction at any cost. Key witnesses, AIM members, and Leonard Peltier give their version of what happened that day on the Res. John Trudell, also,  sheds light on the tensions of AIM and the GOONs in that time period, as well as some of his own personal dealings/pain with losing his family in the cause.This is a good documentary for anyone interested in Native Americans of past and present and anyone interested in justice and American rights. Native or white, we are all Americans and deserve justice and fairness.I don't think you can go wrong with buying this film. If you are interested in present-day Native American culture and/or the Leonard Peltier case, then you should purchase the movie Thunderheart as well. Thunderheart is a drama that takes part of the Peltier story and meshes it with a storyline of the civil war between AIM and the GOONs.

Clearly, his voice prior to Pine Ridge has been amplified a million fold since Pine Ridge.  Do I think he's innocent?  No.  Do I think he's guilty?  Probably.  Yeah, maybe he is &quot;innocent&quot; of the murders themselves, but sometimes if you're standing close to the burning building, and the fire marshall sees you with matches in your hands and the smell of petrol on your clothes, you're liable to go down for arson.  Perhaps you didn't in fact burn the building, but man, what the hell are you doing there with matches and gasoline?  Such is the Peltier case, and the politics and heated emotion surrounding this case make it almost impossible to examine impartially.

Redford must have been seeking the real truth without prejudice, or he would not have gotten so much honesty from everyone he interviewed.Watch this film closely. I think if you do that you will see, as I did, that some of the people he talked to know exactly what happened, they are just not saying.Whoever Mr. X is, he is a coward. How can he allow Peltier to languish in prison for his crimes? This is an outrage.In any case, the people of Pine Ridge were in a crisis situation when this happened and any and all reactions to a couple of white men in pursuit in a nice car on the rez is understandable. An Indian was also killed in this exchange of gunfire, and no one was ever charged for the crime. Being white does not mean your life is worth more. Give me a break.As for Leonard Peltier, as far as I am concerned, if he is 100% guilty and committed two executions at point blank range in 1975, he should still be paroled today.

319384,A1977ZR4KQYZ4J,6302541468,mrgrieves08,"[207, 217]","As you probably already know, this film concerns the blatantly unfair trail and conviction of Leonard Peltier, for the alleged crime of murdering two FBI agents at the Pine Ridge Reservation in 1975. The documentary begins by putting the incident in its proper perspective by showing that the Pine Ridge Reservation, at that time, had one of the highest per capita murder rates in the entire US, with the vast majority of those crimes, even today, still filed as ""unsolved"" (Check out Ward Churchill's ""Indians are Us"" and Agents of Repression for a detailed account of the killings in question). In fact, from 1973 to 1976 at least 69 Aim members and supporters were murdered&#65533;and not one person was ever convicted, or even investigated, for these brutally horrific crimes. Why were these deaths not investigated you may ask. It is because the victims were primarily American Indians involved with AIM who were actively involved in the struggle to retain the lands lawfully granted to them in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 against the federal gov't and the corrupt, unelected BIA administration of Dick Wilson. Many have openly claimed that Wilson and his so-called ""goon squad"" were responsible for these killings, but no investigation was ever conducted by State law enforcement officials or by the FBI; and yet the incident that led to the shooting that left two agents and one Indian dead, centered around an investigation concerning a pair of STOLEN COWBOY BOOTS. You can draw your own conclusions from that.Although three men were originally charged with the murder of the agents in a separate trial preceding Peltier&#65533;s illegal extradition from Canada, the first two defendants were determined to be not guilty of all charges&#65533;their acts viewed as self defense. After this embarrassment the FBI decided that Peltier would be convicted at all costs and set about the task of &#65533;constructing&#65533; a case against him. After a trial marred by official perjury, witness intimidation and clearly manufactured evidence, Leonard Peltier alone was convicted, but then, only after the original judge was inexplicably removed from the case and replaced with one ""friendly"" to the FBI by a prejudiced jury of his &#65533;white&#65533; peers. This film shows the disturbing details surrounding how Peltier was ultimately convicted by this court presided over by an obviously prejudiced judge and jury on what amounts to a mountain of manufactured evidence, witness tampering, and lies.As the film and the FBI's own evidence shows there is absolutely no proof that has not been exposed as fraud, that links Peltier to the murder weapon or the red van (Peltier drove a pickup truck) that the agents reportedly followed onto the reservation. The FBI goes so far as to argue that &#65533;people in this part of the country call a pickup truck a van and vice versa&#65533;&#65533;to explain just one glaring inconsistency in the government&#65533;s case. The FBI's own statements are filled with inconsistencies and outright falsehoods, which resulted in the Federal Judge Edward McManus of the first trial harshly rebuking them for their shameful, reckless and unlawful behavior. In the video the FBI spokesman's dishonesty is clearly, if not painfully, apparent. Simply watch this video and decide for yourself. You will be surprised and certainly appalled by what you see.&#65533;Incident at Oglala&#65533; is a vitally important document detailing a form of repression and cultural genocide that has continued, although in differing forms, since the arrival of Columbus, against Native Americans. The Dali Lama, Nelson Mandela, Bishop Desmond Tutu, The European Parliament and Amnesty International have all urged that executive Clemency be granted to Peltier based on the facts of this case and the massive miscarriage of justice that it represents. This important film is a must see for anyone who cares about the ideals of freedom and justice in this country and the shameful realities that, all too often, hide behind those noble-sounding terms. For as long as men like Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abul-Jamal remain imprisoned, none of us are completely safe from the same treatment.Mitakuye Iyasin!",5,The Earth is Weeping,1023408000,"06 7, 2002",2002,4223,"['probably', 'already', 'know', 'film', 'blatantly', 'unfair', 'trail', 'conviction', 'Leonard', 'Peltier', 'alleged', 'crime', 'murdering', 'two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Pine', 'Ridge', 'Reservation', '1975', 'documentary', 'begins', 'putting', 'incident', 'proper', 'perspective', 'showing', 'Pine', 'Ridge', 'Reservation', 'time', 'had', 'one', 'highest', 'capita', 'murder', 'rates', 'entire', 'US', 'vast', 'majority', 'crimes', 'even', 'today', 'still', 'filed', 'unsolved', 'Check', 'out', 'Ward', 'Churchill', 'Indians', 'are', 'Us', 'Agents', 'Repression', 'detailed', 'account', 'killings', 'question', 'fact', '1973', '1976', 'least', '69', 'Aim', 'members', 'supporters', 'were', 'murdered', '65533', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'was', 'ever', 'convicted', 'even', 'investigated', 'brutally', 'horrific', 'crimes', 'Why', 'were', 'deaths', 'not', 'investigated', 'may', 'ask', 'victims', 'were', 'primarily', 'American', 'Indians', 'involved', 'AIM', 'who', 'were', 'actively', 'involved', 'struggle', 'retain', 'lands', 'lawfully', 'granted', 'Fort', 'Laramie', 'Treaty', '1868', 'federal', ""gov't"", 'corrupt', 'unelected', 'BIA', 'administration', 'Dick', 'Wilson', 'Many', 'have', 'openly', 'claimed', 'Wilson', 'so-called', 'goon', 'squad', 'were', 'responsible', 'killings', 'investigation', 'was', 'ever', 'conducted', 'State', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officials', 'FBI', 'yet', 'incident', 'led', 'shooting', 'left', 'two', 'agents', 'one', 'Indian', 'dead', 'centered', 'investigation', 'concerning', 'pair', 'STOLEN', 'COWBOY', 'BOOTS', 'can', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'three', 'men', 'were', 'originally', 'charged', 'murder', 'agents', 'separate', 'trial', 'preceding', 'Peltier', '65533', 's', 'illegal', 'extradition', 'Canada', 'first', 'two', 'defendants', 'were', 'determined', 'be', 'not', 'guilty', 'charges', '65533', 'acts', 'viewed', 'self', 'defense', 'embarrassment', 'FBI', 'decided', 'Peltier', 'would', 'be', 'convicted', 'costs', 'set', 'task', '65533', 'constructing', '65533', 'case', 'trial', 'marred', 'official', 'perjury', 'witness', 'intimidation', 'clearly', 'manufactured', 'evidence', 'Leonard', 'Peltier', 'alone', 'was', 'convicted', 'then', 'only', 'original', 'judge', 'was', 'inexplicably', 'removed', 'case', 'replaced', 'one', 'friendly', 'FBI', 'prejudiced', 'jury', '65533', 'white', '65533', 'peers', 'film', 'disturbing', 'details', 'surrounding', 'how', 'Peltier', 'was', 'ultimately', 'convicted', 'court', 'presided', 'over', 'obviously', 'prejudiced', 'judge', 'jury', 'what', 'amounts', 'mountain', 'manufactured', 'evidence', 'witness', 'tampering', 'film', 'FBI', 'own', 'evidence', 'shows', 'absolutely', 'proof', 'not', 'been', 'exposed', 'fraud', 'Peltier', 'murder', 'weapon', 'red', 'van', 'Peltier', 'drove', 'pickup', 'truck', 'agents', 'reportedly', 'followed', 'reservation', 'FBI', 'so', 'far', 'argue', '65533', 'people', 'part', 'country', 'call', 'pickup', 'truck', 'van', 'vice', 'versa', '65533', '65533', 'explain', 'just', 'one', 'glaring', 'inconsistency', 'government', '65533', 's', 'case', 'FBI', 'own', 'statements', 'are', 'filled', 'inconsistencies', 'outright', 'falsehoods', 'resulted', 'Federal', 'Judge', 'Edward', 'McManus', 'first', 'trial', 'harshly', 'rebuking', 'shameful', 'reckless', 'unlawful', 'behavior', 'video', 'FBI', 'spokesman', 'dishonesty', 'clearly', 'not', 'painfully', 'apparent', 'Simply', 'watch', 'video', 'decide', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'certainly', 'appalled', 'what', 'see.', '65533', 'Incident', 'Oglala', '65533', 'vitally', 'important', 'document', 'detailing', 'form', 'repression', 'cultural', 'genocide', 'continued', 'differing', 'forms', 'arrival', 'Columbus', 'Native', 'Americans', 'Dali', 'Lama', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'Bishop', 'Desmond', 'Tutu', 'European', 'Parliament', 'Amnesty', 'International', 'have', 'urged', 'executive', 'Clemency', 'be', 'granted', 'Peltier', 'based', 'facts', 'case', 'massive', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'important', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'ideals', 'freedom', 'justice', 'country', 'shameful', 'realities', 'too', 'often', 'hide', 'noble-sounding', 'terms', 'as', 'long', 'men', 'Leonard', 'Peltier', 'Mumia', 'Abul-Jamal', 'remain', 'imprisoned', 'none', 'are', 'completely', 'safe', 'same', 'treatment.Mitakuye', 'Iyasin']",N/A

It seems to me highly probable that Peltier did not murder the FBI agents at Pine Ridge, but there is more that the documentary maker, Michael Apted, could have done.  Here are some questions that I would like to know the answer to:1.  What was the dynamite in the pickup truck for?2.  On what substantive grounds did the prosecutors believe that the ""eyewitnesses"" to the murders (who did not show up at the trial of two AIM members in Cedar Rapids a  year or so before Peltier's trial) were reliable?  Their later appearance and affidavits -- especially the multiple conflicting affidavits of Peltier's alleged girlfriend -- seem altogether too convenient, and so it's tempting to believe that they were bought off or intimidated.3.  What do the FBI have to say about the inconsistencies in the ballistic evidence?  Did Apted even ask?  Or did he just not show their answers?4.  What exactly did the agents say when they were pursuing the ""pick-up truck"" by way of describing what they were pursuing?5.  Mr X -- the confessed killer -- is a bit too convenient on the other side.  Peltier says that he (Mr X) is telling the truth but that he (Peltier) won't shop him.But -- all that aside -- it's hard to see how there was an open-and-shut case against Peltier.  A pardon has long been in order.  He's coming up on 40 years in jail for a crime that there's good reason to believe he didn't commit.My advice is -- see the movie and read Matthiessen, and read a book that treats in equal detail with the case against Peltier.

I could not even begin to conceive myself of how I'd go about piecing together a linear timeline of an incredibly convoluted, complex story (best represented by the notorious 18,000 pages of FBI paper...if you get my drift). But Apted and crew go about it methodically and choose to follow a particular timeline (resting heavily on Robideau and Butler, who appear at great length in the film) that gave me new insight into the story.Also notable was John Trudell's presence; Apted knows how to bring out people's candid personalities so effortlessly, and the end result is that their hearts end up speaking as much as their words (as cheesy as that sounds...I don't know how else to say it. But if you've seen the 7up series, you know what I mean.)

(One bright spot in the story that usually gets lost among the shadows.)[A side note: Not sure what to conclude of the Iowa story, but it did strike me as interesting that the implication was that if Peltier had been tried simultaneously and not stuck in Canada, he, too, would have been found not guilty. But then, who knows what the FBI cronies would have done--they needed SOMEONE to punish...for the first time I considered that while Leonard is a scapegoat, perhaps he is that in the most pure of ways--he took on the wrath of terrorists for his people; not that things got so much better later, but other AIM members like Russell Means or Trudell or Butler/Robideau staying alive does cause me to step back and consider a weird sort of miracle. Actually, most of these guys say on the film that they were sure they were dead many times. Just the fact that they're standing there is crazy. And perhaps they are there because of Leonard. Anyway, that was something positive that I got.]",5,"Meticulous, classic Michael Apted documentary",1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,2231,"['Meticulous', 'classic', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'documentary', 'drama', 'smidgen', 'sensationalism', 'Call', 'nerd', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'editing', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'begin', 'conceive', 'how', ""'d"", 'go', 'piecing', 'together', 'linear', 'timeline', 'incredibly', 'convoluted', 'complex', 'story', 'best', 'represented', 'notorious', '18,000', 'pages', 'FBI', 'paper', 'get', 'drift', 'Apted', 'crew', 'go', 'methodically', 'choose', 'follow', 'particular', 'timeline', 'resting', 'heavily', 'Robideau', 'Butler', 'who', 'appear', 'great', 'length', 'film', 'gave', 'new', 'insight', 'story.Also', 'notable', 'was', 'John', 'Trudell', 'presence', 'Apted', 'how', 'bring', 'out', 'people', 'candid', 'personalities', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'end', 'result', 'hearts', 'end', 'up', 'speaking', 'as', 'much', 'words', 'as', 'cheesy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'else', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', '7up', 'series', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'SO', 'great', 'see', 'ubiquitous', 'people', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'so', 'long', 'flesh', '[', 'well', 'virtually', 'course', 'HAVE', 'met', 'Bruce', 'Ellison', 'who', 'was', 'still', 'plugging', 'away', 'case', '13', 'years', 'later', ']', 'note', 'detailed', 'testimonies', 'lawyers', 'judges', 'connected', 'case', 'did', 'added', 'lot', 'notable', 'particular', 'was', 'Iowa', 'jury', 'foreman', 'One', 'bright', 'spot', 'story', 'usually', 'lost', 'shadows', '[', 'side', 'note', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'conclude', 'Iowa', 'story', 'did', 'strike', 'interesting', 'implication', 'was', 'Peltier', 'had', 'been', 'tried', 'simultaneously', 'not', 'stuck', 'Canada', 'too', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'then', 'who', 'what', 'FBI', 'cronies', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'needed', 'SOMEONE', 'punish', 'first', 'time', 'considered', 'Leonard', 'scapegoat', 'perhaps', 'most', 'pure', 'ways', 'took', 'wrath', 'terrorists', 'people', 'not', 'things', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'later', 'other', 'AIM', 'members', 'Russell', 'Means', 'Trudell', 'Butler/Robideau', 'staying', 'alive', 'cause', 'step', 'back', 'consider', 'weird', 'sort', 'miracle', 'Actually', 'most', 'guys', 'say', 'film', 'were', 'sure', 'were', 'dead', 'many', 'times', 'Just', 'fact', ""'re"", 'standing', 'crazy', 'perhaps', 'are', 'there', 'Leonard', 'Anyway', 'was', 'something', 'positive', 'got', ']']",N/A
