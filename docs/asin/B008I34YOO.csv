1553715,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008I34YOO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[43, 45]","The horror genre has had a spotty track record on television.  Aside from anthology series that introduced a new tale of woe every week, most entries that dabbled in supernatural or monster themes were often more beloved than popular.  I know it seems hard to imagine now with the revitalized interest in everything supernatural.  Vampires, wolves, ghosts, zombies and other beasties rule the airwaves (although still mostly beyond network TV) on premium cable, CW, AMC, FX, and BBCAmerica among others.  I think that's why we still remember the programs that defied conventional wisdom, that attempted something different in trying to tie an on-going mythology to the serialized drama.  Sure daytime had ""Dark Shadows,"" but for every ""X-Files"" or ""Buffy"" that turned into monster cult hits, there were many more that simply vanished without a trace.  Even the show that absolutely set the standard in my opinion, ""Kolchak"" couldn't stay on the air for more than one season in 1974-75 despite a series of successful TV movies.I guess that makes this a perfect time to revisit the short-lived and ill-fated ""Wolf Lake"" from 2001.  The DVD release of this lupine drama proclaims that this show was the ""original werewolf saga"" although FOX had dabbled with the topic in the episodic ""Werewolf"" many years prior.  By no means meant to be a comprehensive list, here is just a few shows with supernatural leanings that failed to cross over to big success:Werewolf (1987), Lasted One SeasonEerie, Indiana (1991), Creepiness for kids, lasted one seasonAmerican Gothic (1995), Small town craziness, lasted one seasonKindred: The Embraced (1996), Vampires lasted 8 episodesMillennium (1996-99) and Lone Gunmen (2001), shorter-lived X-files offshootsPart of the issue with ""Wolf Lake"" was its home network of CBS.  Not exactly a trailblazer in terms of youth programming, the werewolves never seemed like a good fit and the show was canceled in five quick episodes.  Later on, fledgling UPN aired all 9 of the existing episodes but, by that time, everyone had already moved forward.  The centerpiece of ""Wolf Lake"" was the mysterious disappearance of Mia Kirshner.  Her detective boyfriend (Lou Diamond Phillips) is in hot pursuit of any clues or explanations and this leads him to her hometown of (you guessed it) Wolf Lake.  The idyllic burg in the Pacific Northwest certainly seemed quaint and charming, but Diamond Phillips starts to unearth some peculiar happenings. Part of the fun of catching up with ""Wolf Lake"" is seeing its cast including Paul Wesley, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Sharon Lawrence, Tim Matheson, Scott Bairstow, and Graham Greene partaking in the horrific melodrama.Unlike many, I won't claim that ""Wolf Lake"" was brilliant.  It was a show that had a creepy setting and a slow build tension.  What it also had was the potential to develop into a satisfying supernatural soap opera.  It never really got that opportunity, though.  Obviously, there is an incompleteness to this presentation with only nine episodes.  And sure, if you were an original fan--you'd want to get this 3 disc set.  For those that don't remember the show, you might feel left a little stranded.  The DVD release has a documentary feature about the show (quite enlightening) and an unaired pilot episode (also interesting).

I have a favorite show that aired from 1977 to 1978 whch had at best 12 episodes.  It's never seen the light of day and certainly not DVD release.  Wolf Lake: The Complete Series did include all the episodes of the series aired.  Many times the music is tangled up in legal nightmares which forces the post production companies to ADD new music so what.  It would be best if we had the music in all the DVD's that was aired originally but sometimes that just is not possible.  Sometimes people who write music just want too much so their music is edited out and replaced by suitable substitute content.  I'd rather listen to different music and have Wolf Lake: The Complete Series in my DVD collection when the alternative is to never enjoy this fine series at all.  Many times you see once loved series butchered on cable to fit in ninty thousand commercials.  All in all I think Wolf Lake: The Complete Series is pretty good.  As for Wolf Lake: The Complete Series not being in High Def again so what.  I'm just happy to have the Wolf Lake: The Complete Series even without the High Definition Blue Ray Quality Experience.  I've seen the DVD's and they are easily watchable in quality.  The Wolf Lake: The Complete Series does end in a cliff hanger due to sudden termination of the series but I look at that as a mixed blessing.  I get to determine how the series ends or goes on using my own imagination.  I am a child of the 1960's so I am one of those rare few who still has an active vivid imagination.  Just because the credits rolled on the last disk with unfinished story arcs and plotlines does not mean my imagination can't take over to provide an ending that satisfies me.  If you want a suitable ending to Wolf Lake: The Complete Series then just use your imagination that's what I did.  You might be out of practice but, I'm sure with a little effort you can fire up your imagination and figure out the ending to Wolf Lake: The Complete Series that best suits your personal take on this fine bit of acting that too soon was cancelled.Don't get me wrong I am an old man and love to complain but there are times when I get something that might not be perfect but it is good enough!  Sometimes when I get something that is good enough I just buy it and run like the wind!
