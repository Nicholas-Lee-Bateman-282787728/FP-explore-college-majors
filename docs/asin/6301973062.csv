Mrs. Kilmer is the brunette fatale in this outing, hiring down-on-his luck P.I. (are there any other kind in film noir?) Val to help her fake her own &quot;death&quot; for some typically complex reasons one often finds in this genre. The usual twists and turns ensue, with the expected Great American West backdrop. Michael Madsen tackles the role of the double-crossed boyfriend with his patented Psychotic Elvis routine.

Val Kilmer is too boyish to bring off the classic role of private eye, but at least he doesn't try to act tough while being slapped around or thrown like a rag doll over a series of chairs and tables. In fact his Jack Andrews gets pushed around by almost everyone in what amounts to one of the most feckless of all movie private eyes. His every move seems to either flop or backfire. He's seldom in charge of any encounter, and in that important regard, the movie stands as a genuine oddity to the genre. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, looking like a trampy Natalie Wood, is reasonably convincing as the femme fatale, squealing delightedly whenever she's roughed up. Then there's villainous Michael Madsen, looking like Elvis's spooky older brother, who steals the show with a series of scary outbursts that are totally convincing.

283893,A2IV22IN8A1I1K,6301973062,Steven J. Weller,"[1, 1]","He makes really cool little movies, but he can't seem to get a decent video release!  Kill Me Again is his first film as a director, and this bargain-basement DVD has no special features save the original theatrical trailer.  No director's commentary track, no out-takes or deleted scenes, no behind-the-scenes footage or EPK material or much of anything else.  Even the transfer's nothing to write home about, and of course it's not in widescreen (the film was shot in 1.85).  The GOOD news is that he and his film were given such little respect that they didn't even bother to pan n' scan; instead they did a full-frame transfer, including a lot of material at the top and bottom of the frame that was never intended to be seen.  Why is this good news?  Because if you're looking at it on a widescreen TV you can click to ""overscan"" and get a close approximation of the original framing, which definitely helps.  It's worth doing that, and in fact it's worth getting this DVD.  This film begins what's commonly referred to as Dahl's ""noir trilogy,"" along with Red Rock West and The Last Seduction, and it's a great bit of fun.  The plot is complex and twisty but still always makes sense, and the performances are spot-on.  Joanne Whalley-Kilmer's alliterative femme fatale Fay Forester is evil, wicked, mean and nasty, plus hot as a two-dollar pistol.  Pretty boy Val Kilmer's the almost-honest private dick with the tortured past, and Michael Madsen's the kind of psycho he pretty much always plays these days, but from back before he was just phoning them in.  Red Rock West and The Last Seduction got similarly shoddy DVD releases but were also, mercifully, transferred full-frame rather than panned and scanned, and like Kill Me Again they're typically available used, for cheap.  Which kinda' makes up for the fact that there are no extras at all, on any of them (Red Rock West doesn't even have a menu!).  If you love films noir, these are terrific modern incarnations in every sense, but if you're looking for a decent DVD release, that didn't happen until You Kill Me - which is also a great film from Dahl.  It fits right in with the first three, but it's more of a comedy.",4,Poor John Dahl...,1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,2185,"['really', 'cool', 'little', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'decent', 'video', 'release', 'Kill', 'Me', 'Again', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'bargain-basement', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'save', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'director', 'commentary', 'track', 'out-takes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'EPK', 'material', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'Even', 'transfer', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'course', 'not', 'widescreen', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '1.85', 'GOOD', 'news', 'film', 'were', 'given', 'such', 'little', 'respect', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'pan', 'n', 'scan', 'instead', 'did', 'full-frame', 'transfer', 'including', 'lot', 'material', 'top', 'bottom', 'frame', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'seen', 'Why', 'good', 'news', ""'re"", 'looking', 'widescreen', 'TV', 'can', 'click', 'overscan', 'get', 'close', 'approximation', 'original', 'framing', 'definitely', 'worth', 'doing', 'fact', 'worth', 'getting', 'DVD', 'film', 'what', 'commonly', 'referred', 'Dahl', 'noir', 'trilogy', 'Red', 'Rock', 'West', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'great', 'bit', 'fun', 'plot', 'complex', 'twisty', 'still', 'always', 'sense', 'performances', 'are', 'spot-on', 'Joanne', 'Whalley-Kilmer', 'alliterative', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Fay', 'Forester', 'evil', 'wicked', 'mean', 'nasty', 'hot', 'two-dollar', 'pistol', 'Pretty', 'boy', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'almost-honest', 'private', 'dick', 'tortured', 'past', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'kind', 'psycho', 'pretty', 'much', 'always', 'days', 'back', 'was', 'just', 'phoning', 'Red', 'Rock', 'West', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'got', 'similarly', 'shoddy', 'DVD', 'releases', 'were', 'also', 'mercifully', 'transferred', 'full-frame', 'rather', 'panned', 'scanned', 'Kill', 'Me', 'Again', ""'re"", 'typically', 'available', 'used', 'cheap', 'Which', 'kinda', 'up', 'fact', 'are', 'extras', 'Red', 'Rock', 'West', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'menu', 'love', 'films', 'noir', 'are', 'terrific', 'modern', 'incarnations', 'sense', ""'re"", 'looking', 'decent', 'DVD', 'release', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Kill', 'Me', 'also', 'great', 'film', 'Dahl', 'right', 'first', 'three', 'more', 'comedy']",N/A
283894,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6301973062,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 5]","There's no other master of the modern film noir thriller than John Dahl. ""Kill Me Again"" has all the classic elements of the genre and Dahl's stylistic, sharp direction with strong performances from the cast. Although it starts off strong it does lose a bit of momentum towards the last third of the movie as the lovers go on the run. Private eye Jack Andrews (Val Kilmer)has fallen into a world of booze and loan sharks after the accidently death of his wife. He has three days to pay back  a pair of loan sharks before they break his body to match his broken spirit. With no clients and little in the way of prospects it appears that Jack is doomed.That's when Fay (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer)walks through the door. Her ex-con boyfriend is out to get her because she made off with the money they stole. She's looking for a way out and she and Jack may be each other's salvation. She offers Jack $10,000 to help her fake her death so that her psycho boyfriend Vince (Michael Madsen)won't hunt her down and kill her. Jack does his job all too well. When Fay really disappears after her ""faked"" murder he becomes a suspect. Jack desperately searches for her in hopes getting his money and getting away with ""murder"".I'd definitely recommend getting this title before it disappears (it's not exactly in the top 10 much less the top 1000 popular titles)but have to caution viewers not to expect much in the way of extras. A well made film noir that will keep you interested with all its twists and turns, this isn't Dahl's best film nor is it MGM's best DVD. Presented pretty much bare bones in full screen(like Dahl's classic ""The Last Seduction""), the film looks solid but is definite need of an overall and re-release on DVD. We do get the original theatrical trailer as the only extra but the fact that it isn't presented in widescreen (or at least in both full and widescreen like ""Red Rock West"")is a crime.Here's hoping that this one of the titles MGM/UA revamps for re-release soon. It certainly deserves a commentary track by Dahl (maybe even Kilmer will pipe in). It also deserves at the very least a featurette for fans of the film. This isn't a bad DVD (although it could look better); it just deserved a whole lot more than this bare bone presentation.",4,Dahl's thriller starts off strong,1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,2258,"['other', 'master', 'modern', 'film', 'noir', 'thriller', 'John', 'Dahl', 'Kill', 'Me', 'Again', 'classic', 'elements', 'genre', 'Dahl', 'stylistic', 'sharp', 'direction', 'strong', 'performances', 'cast', 'strong', 'lose', 'bit', 'momentum', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'lovers', 'go', 'run', 'Private', 'eye', 'Jack', 'Andrews', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'fallen', 'world', 'booze', 'loan', 'sharks', 'accidently', 'death', 'wife', 'three', 'days', 'pay', 'back', 'pair', 'loan', 'sharks', 'break', 'body', 'match', 'broken', 'spirit', 'clients', 'little', 'way', 'prospects', 'Jack', 'doomed.That', 'when', 'Fay', 'Joanne', 'Whalley-Kilmer', 'door', 'ex-con', 'boyfriend', 'out', 'get', 'made', 'off', 'money', 'stole', 'looking', 'way', 'Jack', 'may', 'be', 'other', 'salvation', 'Jack', '10,000', 'help', 'fake', 'death', 'psycho', 'boyfriend', 'Vince', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hunt', 'down', 'kill', 'Jack', 'job', 'too', 'well', 'When', 'Fay', 'really', 'faked', 'murder', 'suspect', 'Jack', 'desperately', 'hopes', 'getting', 'money', 'getting', 'away', 'murder', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'getting', 'title', 'not', 'exactly', 'top', '10', 'much', 'less', 'top', '1000', 'popular', 'titles', 'have', 'caution', 'viewers', 'not', 'expect', 'much', 'way', 'extras', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'noir', 'will', 'keep', 'interested', 'twists', 'turns', ""n't"", 'Dahl', 'best', 'film', 'MGM', 'best', 'DVD', 'Presented', 'pretty', 'much', 'bare', 'bones', 'full', 'screen', 'Dahl', 'classic', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'film', 'solid', 'definite', 'need', 'overall', 're-release', 'DVD', 'do', 'get', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'only', 'extra', 'fact', ""n't"", 'presented', 'widescreen', 'least', 'full', 'widescreen', 'Red', 'Rock', 'West', 'crime.Here', 'hoping', 'one', 'titles', 'MGM/UA', 'revamps', 're-release', 'soon', 'certainly', 'commentary', 'track', 'Dahl', 'maybe', 'even', 'Kilmer', 'will', 'pipe', 'also', 'very', 'least', 'featurette', 'fans', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'DVD', 'could', 'look', 'better', 'just', 'deserved', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'bare', 'bone', 'presentation']",N/A
