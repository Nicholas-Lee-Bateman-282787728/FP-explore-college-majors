1694055,A300SZFHJ8NHBL,B00ICXM1UE,George56,"[1, 1]",This was a very well done Movie of a true story of two Missionaries that were abducted in Russia. If you have a missionary out on the field you may want to wait till they get home before you see it. A little nerve racking. Good family night movie and is rated PG-13 in case you have little ones.,5,Outstanding Movie,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,295,"['was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Movie', 'true', 'story', 'two', 'Missionaries', 'were', 'abducted', 'Russia', 'have', 'missionary', 'out', 'field', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'till', 'get', 'home', 'see', 'little', 'nerve', 'racking', 'Good', 'family', 'night', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'case', 'have', 'little', 'ones']",Saratov Approach DVD
1694056,AWA79DF9KLF5Y,B00ICXM1UE,"Merlin Douglas Larsen ""Merlin the Mad""","[1, 1]","I vacillate between 3 and 4 stars. I suspect that If I watched it again I'd pick 3 stars. But seeing it once and letting it work on me, 4 stars.There are a few awkward moments, mostly when the film focuses on the families of the kidnapped missionaries. And some of the religious content ever so slightly crosses into the &#34;preaching&#34; arena, but not pushed in your face.The dialogue, cinematography, acting, characterizations, accurate story/plot (by all accounts), authentic shooting locations, are all first rate. The musical score is mostly seamlessly woven in, adding rather than detracting from the visuals.  It is the best &#34;Mormon&#34; film I have seen.The redemption moment, where the missionaries stop trying to interfere with &#34;God's plan&#34; and simply allow their fate to happen, I found to be moving and powerful. The implied future redemption of Sergei (a first-rate bad guy) is wordlessly written on his face as he has a metaphysical experience that he cannot explain or deny. Humanity, brotherhood, and something Infinite, ambush and amaze him and he cannot pull the trigger. That was my favorite moment.",4,3.5 and minor spoilers,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,1133,"['vacillate', '3', '4', 'stars', 'suspect', 'watched', 'again', ""'d"", 'pick', '3', 'stars', 'seeing', 'once', 'letting', 'work', '4', 'are', 'few', 'awkward', 'moments', 'mostly', 'when', 'film', 'families', 'kidnapped', 'missionaries', 'religious', 'content', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', '34', 'preaching', '34', 'arena', 'not', 'pushed', 'face.The', 'dialogue', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'characterizations', 'accurate', 'story/plot', 'accounts', 'authentic', 'shooting', 'locations', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'musical', 'score', 'mostly', 'seamlessly', 'woven', 'adding', 'rather', 'detracting', 'visuals', 'best', '34', 'Mormon', '34', 'film', 'have', 'seen.The', 'redemption', 'moment', 'where', 'missionaries', 'stop', 'trying', 'interfere', '34', 'God', 'plan', '34', 'simply', 'allow', 'fate', 'happen', 'found', 'be', 'moving', 'powerful', 'implied', 'future', 'redemption', 'Sergei', 'first-rate', 'bad', 'guy', 'wordlessly', 'written', 'face', 'metaphysical', 'experience', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'deny', 'Humanity', 'brotherhood', 'something', 'Infinite', 'ambush', 'amaze', 'can', 'not', 'pull', 'trigger', 'was', 'favorite', 'moment']",Saratov Approach DVD

What happened in the end was truly a miracle of faith. Just watch it and forget which church you go to. It doesn't matter!

1694058,A1EAXJN3UMKXYV,B00ICXM1UE,Suz,"[0, 0]","The country came together to pray for these kidnapped young men. It isn't necessary to be of their faith to learn of their experience. Because the true story is told with very little deviation fron actual events it isn't Hollywood. It is far better with interest, emotion, drama and intensity. The film is rich with directorial skills from the scenery to the camera angles. The actors looked a bit old to portray 20 yo boys but their acting was outstanding. True, there is no sex or profanity which is the Hollywood fallback but the story is strong enough without gimmicks.
