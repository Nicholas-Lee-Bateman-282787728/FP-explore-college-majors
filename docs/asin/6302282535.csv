305671,A1GSNXORN62759,6302282535,David,"[3, 15]","""You're in my world now.""If you hate yourself and everyone you live with, rent this movie. Or if you can't just get enough of the violence of ""Walker: Texas Ranger,"" and would much rather spend money on something you can get for free, buy this film. Buy this film in VHS form so you can have a test tape to put in your VCR just to see if it will either work or eat your tape. Then when it does eat your tape, you won't be upset.PLOT SUMMARY: Within the first five-minutes, Chuck knocks a villain unconscious, and then he lifts him off the ground and says, ""Now you're in my world,"" and hits him again. His world is apparently all about needless violence and hitting unconscious people. I guess that's why we like Chuck's films. (Speaking of needless violence, why do his movies usually have grenade launchers just lying around, i.e. Invasion USA? Needless violence and a surplussage of grenade launchers. It's like an ultra-2nd Amendment world where even old ladies have concealed sawed-off shotguns.)  Other than that, this film is about Chuck getting betrayed by his partner (he's shot, falls through a plate glass window, falls three stories, and lands on a car). Unfortunately for his partner DeLaney, Cliff Garrett (Chuck) pulls a Rasputin and survives. But the entire criminal world thinks he's dead (they probably didn't care much because they didn't even know who he was (!), if they did, Cliff wouldn't have been able to go undercover for the mob). This becomes a perfect time for Cliff Garrett (I can't get enough of that name) to go undercover as a Hitman for the mafia in Seattle. He makes his way up the chain by ""proving"" himself to the ""grande fromage,"" which actually requires needless violence (shooting an unarmed mafia underling). The plot thickens when the French and ""Iranians"" get involved. It's really all kind of confusing, so I didn't bother to try to untangle it. (Does the mafia actually have a big presence in Seattle?) All that you really need to know is that Chuck is there to pull down the pillars of the dark underworld and find a way to get revenge on DeLaney for hurting his stunt double.This whole film is worth watching just to see Chuck Norris in a scene with his mafia girlfriend: you see him ineptly thrust her against the wall, touch her lip (the camera lingers a little too long on her face), and then Chuck slides awkwardly down--out of the scene. Hurray for Chuck! It's like he's telling the audience at home, ""Real men can go down on their woman."" Let's hope she immediately filed a restraining order upon the completion of this shameful five-minute act. But this isn't the only progressive part of the film. He also teaches the local minority how to fistfight in a well-choreographed montage. Apparently, in Chuck's world, the kid just needs to be taught how to defend himself against the neo-Nazi middle schoolers that have been harassing him for being a poor black kid raised by a single-black mother. The film is actually kind of interesting in that it has this whole part about being anti-racist, but it seems to be completely oblivious to the fact that it's blatantly offensive to Muslims: He goes into an Iranian bar, spits on their culture, stares at their belly dancer with lust, calls everyone a ""Camel Jockey,"" and proceeds to roundhouse kick everyone in their face. (I'm not making this up, and since the completion of the this film attacks on Muslims by roundhouse kick has increased 10,000%.) Also, there is a scene right out of Guantanamo Bay where a Muslim is force fed pork. Nevertheless, it's worth actually watching the local minority, ""Tiger,"" defend himself, if not for any other reason than to see how Chuck's philosophy of violence as a legitimate form of dispute-resolution play itself out in this microcosm of the film.) Luckily for ""Tiger,"" his 20-minute defense training works. But he has been drawn so completely into Chuck's world of violence that he ends up in the hospital. In the good-old fashioned American way, Chuck makes it up to him though, with a box full of money. Let's hope your shoebox full of money covers his medical bills: skin grafting, physical therapy, pain medication, etc. But I guess a ""box full of money"" makes sense in a materialistic culture devoid of morality--Chuck's world.  How about an apology Chuck!? How about making him whole again!? How about holding his mother who has been traumatized by the possibility of losing the only thing that matters to her in the world!? How about sitting next to him and holding his hand in the hospital? Or how about just accepting the fact that your violence perpetuates more violence and innocent people get hurt? Repudiate yourself. ""No!,"" Chuck yells to audience at home, ""I will not repudiate my actions. I will end this film with a grotesque example of my own inhumanity by destroying the main villain in the most clever, but disturbing, way that I can think of."" Thank you Chuck. And the children at home and in this hospital thank you too.If you really hate my review, then tell me why this film is good, besides the fact that Chuck is a great guy. Oh, and if you haven't seen Invasion USA, buy it.

And the Iranians are invading with the help of a rotten ex-cop turned drug-lordlet. All that is by far too much and too many. So many will have to be eliminated. What's more there is the ghost of an officially dead cop playing the double agent, and he was officially killed by the rotten ex-cop turned drug-lordlet. And the ghost will finally meet face to face with this drug-lordlet and the latter will be turned into mid-air minced meat, after the three other gangs had mutually been eliminated one after the other by one of the others.

One needs to suspend belief during the entire ""experience"".Chuck is a police detective betrayed and left for dead by his partner.  After the shooting, we next see Chuck some years later working as some nebulous enforcer for a local mob.  Chuck kills people with equanimity, something for which the law has little tolerance regardless of how much the bad guys deserve it.  Chuck shows no respect to his police superior, and gets away with it.  Except for infiltration, there seems to be little purpose in his underground work.He lives in an apartment building and gives out his key to a kid down the hall.  His sense of what is safe doesn't seem to be much of a concern.  Everyone knows where he lives, even the mob boss' wife, played by Alberta Watson in a wasted role.  However she and Chuck lust after each other and when her husband finds out, he decides to kill Chuck, otherwise the movie was going nowhere fast.  Now everyone decides to kill everyone.  There are 3 gangs involved, one of them Iranian and since this was in '91 when the Gulf War was going on, it's easy to make them bad guys.Chuck's acting is pretty bad, but not as bad as some of his early stuff.  Michael Parks does a reasonable job as the former partner who resurfaces for the obligatory revenge climax.  Al Waxman, as the mob boss, does the best he can with the part as written.I buy these action movies for exercising on a stationary rowing machine.

Still, it's difficult to appreciate the movie 100% when considering that at the same time, Seagal and Van Damme were producing some of their most adrenaline-fueled vehicles; in comparison, Norris' film is a bit toothless, relying very heavily on a story that could conceivably been pulled off better by another star and/or director. For fans, I'd say this one's definitely worth owning, but casual karate aficionados should look in other places for their kicks.The story: after being double-crossed by his crooked parter (Michael Parks,Kill Bill) and declared dead, policeman Cliff Garrett (Norris,Walker, Texas Ranger) goes undercover as a mob enforcer. It will be up to him to diffuse a brewing mafia war before he is uncovered.I know I'm going to receive mucho ""unhelpful"" votes for writing this, but I can't help but think that Chuck was trying to emulate Steven Seagal with this vehicle. His long hair is a dead giveaway, the plot point of a police officer being declared dead only to come back later was lifted right fromHard to Kill, and the overtly gritty tone and mob affiliation themes (not to mention the scene wherein he blows a villain's legs apart with a shotgun) had been seen only half a year prior to this one inOut for Justice. With that said, Norris never really seems to betray himself or his image: the story has some nicks in it and the narration is occasionally soppy (e.g. emotional music suggests we're supposed to feel sorry when the despicable mob characters are killed), but it feels a lot more confident and streamlined than most of Seagal's features, and Norris himself never contradicts his own archetype. My favorite scenes were those wherein he interacts with child actor Salim Grant (Ghost Dad) and teaches him to stand up to a bully and subsequently has the two of them end up shaking hands.In these scenes, he teaches the kid some karate moves, and that's just about all the martial artistry you're going to see in this movie. The action is unbelievably scarce for a Cannon Pictures production, limited to a single short fistfight and a handful of one-sided shootouts. As I pointed out earlier, the thriller portions work out well enough - especially during the picture's middle act - but they're not proper substitutes to fisticuffs. To make up for this are the incredibly hammy characterizations of the mafia characters: stereotypes ahoy with the Brooklyn-accented, meat factory-owning Don (Al Waxman,Cagney & Lacey), the fancy-eating French-Canadian boss (Marcel Sabourin,Lilies), and moustached Iranian leader whom Chuck visits in a belly-dancing lounge and utters token lines like ""Allah protects us"" (Frank Ferrucci, who isn't actually Arabian). They're pretty offensive if you choose to take 'em seriously, but I think of them as just goofy and entertaining in an overblown way.Not too much more to say about this one, besides that other people will probably have more fun with it than me and that Chucky Ducky's definitely done worse.

305680,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6302282535,Sid the Elf,"[1, 1]","The Chuck wagon keeps rolling with The Hitman. We, Sid the Elf, are only sad that eventually we will run out of Norris movies to review. Don't be at all shocked if we start reviewing Walker, Texas Ranger seasons soon. Anyway, The Hitman was a pleasant surprise to Sid. We knew the title, but we thought that there was no way Chuck would be playing a straight up hitman. He did, even if it was as an undercover cop. This just proves Chuck's depth, skill, and prowess as an actor.At the start of the movie, Chuck plays a narcotics cop named Cliff Garrett. He is on a bust with his partner, who turns out to be dirty and shoots Chuck right in the chest, causing him to go through a plate glass window, fall three stories and land on a car. It was an absolutely harrowing sight to see a bloody Chuck being rolled into the hospital on a gurney. Somber mood in the North Pole at that point. Remember, this is Chuck, of course he wasn't dead. But he was pissed. He must have been really pissed, enough to infiltrate the mob undercover, become their top contract killer (or hitman, get it?), and painstakingly exact revenge on his bum of a partner and the gangsters who controled him.Now, Chuck goes by the name Danny Grogan, the fierce Irish hitman for the mob. Great names in this one, they probably took about 10 seconds to come up with. Adds to the B factor. He is called a mick several times throughout the film, which always gets a solid 8 on the comedy meter. And we thought we even heard Chuck call some guy a guido or something, and that always gets a solid 9 on the comedy meter if for no other reason than it makes Sid think of the legendary Dave Kleinfeld. Hey you, you wop! Anyway, imagine Chuck's already high level of toughness. Then it goes up when he plays a hitman, obviously. Now, he's playing an undercover cop hitman exacting revenge left and right! Ultra-tough, uber-tough movie all around. There was also a steamy love scene with Chuck, disturbing and hillarious at the same time. Speaking of disturbing and hillarious: what about the chunk of the film that focused on Chuck's To Catch a Predator-like relationship with the neighborhood kid? Made the film. The kid was being bullied by some mini-nazis because he's black so Chuck taught him how to fight. Also, the kid went on to um... i guess star in Saved By the Bell: The New Class. Perfect! And, Sid really believes that Chuck used this oportunity to show that he could make an instructional karate video after The Hitman failed miserably. As a special added touch, the director, Aaron Norris(yep, Chuck's brother. Too good to be true, right?) gave us a fight scene between the black kid and his bully that has to be seen to be believed.So, obviously, Chuck takes down everyone. The Italian mob, the French-Canadian mob, his dirty ex-partner, and the Iranian mob. The Iranian mob is possibly the most pivotal part in this film because their leader was a dead ringer for Borat. Sid is 138% convinced that Sasha Baron Cohen, or whatever, got high one night, caught The Hitman on cable at 2:30 am while eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch saw this guy and came up with the Borat character.The Hitman definitely gets 5 stars from Sid the Elf. It had mobsters from Kazacstahn, the longest Norris mullett to date, and a future Saved by the Bell: The New Class cast member. There were too many tough lines from Chuck to count, including the famous scene that had Chuck calling roughly 24 guys ""Camel Jockeys."" You had an inumerable number of roundhouse kicks as always. And, introducing a new term to the reviews of B expert Sid the Elf, The Hitman had a DMF of 9. What is the DMF you ask? It's the Don Mattingly Factor. It has long been the theory of Sid the Elf that any good action B must have at least one guy that looks like Don Mattingly. You know, wavy mullet, handlebar mustache; all the things that make someone just look funny. Well, The Hitman had 9 by Sid's count! This is fitting because Don Mattingly's nickname? You guessed it. The Hitman. Coinsidence? Sid thinks not.",5,It usually rains in the Pacific Northwest.
