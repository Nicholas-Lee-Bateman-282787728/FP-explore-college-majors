Ginger, super unbeatable hit woman, and her BFF CoCo, are a fabulous killing team. Well, Ginger kills and CoCo lends moral support. Ginger's boyfriend, Bobby, has been ordered by his crime family to do some hits, but he's farmed out the job to Ginger and CoCo (who do wonderful kills that include drawing fake eyes on the lids of one of their marks!). But when it comes out that Bobby isn't really doing the hits, his family is mortified, and now Ginger and CoCo are being hunted! This is a campy, kitchy film with lots of great moments: ginger on a roller-derby killing spree, the ladies having a tea-party with acid sugar cubes...really quite sharp!",4,Queens of culty B Movies!,1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,717,"['expected', 'movie', 'be', 'crap', 'really', 'quite', 'charming', 'Ginger', 'super', 'unbeatable', 'hit', 'woman', 'BFF', 'CoCo', 'are', 'fabulous', 'killing', 'team', 'Well', 'Ginger', 'kills', 'CoCo', 'moral', 'support', 'Ginger', 'boyfriend', 'Bobby', 'been', 'ordered', 'crime', 'family', 'do', 'hits', 'farmed', 'out', 'job', 'Ginger', 'CoCo', 'who', 'do', 'wonderful', 'kills', 'include', 'drawing', 'fake', 'eyes', 'lids', 'one', 'marks', 'when', 'out', 'Bobby', ""n't"", 'really', 'doing', 'hits', 'family', 'mortified', 'now', 'Ginger', 'CoCo', 'are', 'being', 'hunted', 'campy', 'kitchy', 'film', 'lots', 'great', 'moments', 'ginger', 'roller-derby', 'killing', 'spree', 'ladies', 'having', 'tea-party', 'acid', 'sugar', 'cubes', 'really', 'quite', 'sharp']",Killer Drag Queens on Dope
1034663,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B000KJU0YW,Kerry Walters,"[2, 3]","At a first glance, ""Killer Drag Queens on Dope"" is a film that, depending on one's mood, comes across as either annoyingly stupid or hilariously campy.  But dig a little deeper, and you realize that it's actually a clever gender-bending of any number of stereotypes involving not only realworld masculine and feminine roles, but also hackneyed Hollywood portrayals of men and women.It's also, by the way, just an incredibly fun film to watch.  Alexis Arquette as Ginger, one of the drag queen killers, steals the whole show with her acting versatility.  (She's also gorgeous, by the way.)  Omar Alexis' performance as her sidekick Coco is also good (ditto on the gorgeous part), as is Don Edmonds' deadpanned and hilarious performance as Uncle A, the mafia don.Things move from fun to interesting when you realize just how many gender stereotypies get busted by this movie.  Bobby, Ginger's studly boyfriend and Uncle A's designated hitman, is too squeamish to pull off his assignments, and hands them over to his girl, Ginger.  On the other hand, Ginger and Coco, feminine in an over-the-top way, are perfectly able and willing to whack guys.  Uncle A's very masculine henchmen are all buffoons who, although kinda lovable, are ""girly"" in their timidity.  And Uncle A, who comes across as a brutal piece of work somewhere between Don Corleone and Charles Manson, does a surprising bit of gender-bending himself at film's end.Sets are minimalistic, the sound is sometimes tinny, and occasionally the editing is choppy and abrupt.  I don't know if all this is a consequence of an extremely low budget, or if it's an intentional mimicking of the poor quality of the cheap 1970s exploitation films that ""Killer Drag Queens"" seems to be spoofing.  But either way, it works.",4,Gender fluidity,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,1769,"['first', 'glance', 'Killer', 'Drag', 'Queens', 'Dope', 'film', 'depending', 'one', 'mood', 'annoyingly', 'stupid', 'hilariously', 'campy', 'little', 'deeper', 'realize', 'actually', 'clever', 'gender-bending', 'number', 'stereotypes', 'involving', 'not', 'only', 'realworld', 'masculine', 'feminine', 'roles', 'also', 'hackneyed', 'Hollywood', 'portrayals', 'men', 'women.It', 'also', 'way', 'just', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'Alexis', 'Arquette', 'Ginger', 'one', 'drag', 'queen', 'killers', 'steals', 'whole', 'show', 'acting', 'versatility', 'also', 'gorgeous', 'way', 'Omar', 'Alexis', 'performance', 'sidekick', 'Coco', 'also', 'good', 'ditto', 'gorgeous', 'part', 'Don', 'Edmonds', 'deadpanned', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'Uncle', 'A', 'mafia', 'don.Things', 'move', 'fun', 'interesting', 'when', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'gender', 'stereotypies', 'get', 'busted', 'movie', 'Bobby', 'Ginger', 'studly', 'boyfriend', 'Uncle', 'A', 'designated', 'hitman', 'too', 'squeamish', 'pull', 'off', 'assignments', 'over', 'girl', 'Ginger', 'other', 'hand', 'Ginger', 'Coco', 'feminine', 'over-the-top', 'way', 'are', 'perfectly', 'able', 'willing', 'whack', 'guys', 'A', 'very', 'masculine', 'henchmen', 'are', 'buffoons', 'who', 'kinda', 'lovable', 'are', 'girly', 'timidity', 'Uncle', 'A', 'who', 'across', 'brutal', 'piece', 'work', 'somewhere', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'surprising', 'bit', 'gender-bending', 'film', 'end.Sets', 'are', 'minimalistic', 'sound', 'sometimes', 'tinny', 'occasionally', 'editing', 'choppy', 'abrupt', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'consequence', 'extremely', 'low', 'budget', 'intentional', 'mimicking', 'poor', 'quality', 'cheap', '1970s', 'exploitation', 'films', 'Killer', 'Drag', 'Queens', 'be', 'spoofing', 'way']",Killer Drag Queens on Dope

As a gay man, I grow weary of watching such abhoring, and pointless creations...I was expecting something hillarious, but instead we are stuck with lifeless (litterally) character references, & a REALLY pointless storyline...Again, The film is as dumbed down as its title suggests, it would be EASILY classified as ""Snuff Film"", because ALL you see throughout the film is two TERRIBLY tragic drag queens, killing people, the agents & agencies responsible for the killings, and, as if it weren't obvious enough, them two, getting off on a vast array of class A drugs...All this and there seems to be a soupcon of humour, and I truly don't know if it even classifies as laughable... I had to tickle myself to be able to afford even a smile while watching this.If you want to watch drug diffused drag queens, killing people that they have been asked to, with over acted & under-dialogued characters, then go ahead & buy the dvd. For the rest of you, who ARE indeed wondering if this is a b-grade comedy or not, get yourself a copy of ""Dance Flick"", because at least you'll get a few great laughs from that!
