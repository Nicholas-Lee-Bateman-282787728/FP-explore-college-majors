1314538,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B002ZTQVBQ,Amanda Richards,"[1, 4]","From Hayao Miyazaki, the master of Japanese animation, comes a story similar to The Little Mermaid, where a small and ever-so-cute fish-like female becomes infatuated with a land dwelling male, and moves heaven and earth, and a lot of ocean to try to make her dream come true.Short attention span summary (SASS):1. Fish girl lives with her father and siblings in an aquarium-like home inside a really cool submarine with flippers.2. Headstrong and clever, she sneaks out to see the surface, and encounters the debris of human civilization, immediately getting into trouble.3. She is rescued by a young boy, and a strong bond is forged between the two.4. Daddy comes to the rescue to save his kidnapped child5. ... but finds that girls just wanna have fun6. Everything goes topsy-turvy until her mother shows upPonyo is a wonderfully entertaining movie for young children, and although not as strong in plot as Miyazaki's other movies like Princess Mononoke or Howl's Moving Castle, the animation is excellent, and the story will touch your heart.There is no shortage of voice talent, with Noah Cyrus (Miley's little sister) as Ponyo, Frankie (the bonus) Jonas as her friend Sosuke, and also Tina Fey, Matt Damon, Liam Neeson, Cate Blanchett, Cloris Leachman, Betty White and Lily Tomlin.This is one to see with the entire family, but falls just short of perfect with a few too many inexplicable elements.

1314541,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZTQVBQ,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Like Japan's answer to `The Little Mermaid', `Ponyo' is every bit as enchanting and as memorable as that Disney classic.  With sharply used animation that is beautiful to look at while wholly nostalgic (this isn't your average 3D CGI spectacle), `Ponyo' creates something original and authentic.The film follows a young Goldfish Princess who is washed ashore after attempting to escape the domineering control of her human father, an evil wizard who hates humankind for destroying to ocean.  He is married to the Ocean's queen, a magnificent being who is far more levelheaded and endearing than her husband.  This young Princess winds up stuck in a bottle and is found by a young boy named Koichi.  Koichi is living alone with his mother while his father, a sailor, is away at work.  Koichi is enamored by this creature, a fish with the face of a human, and while he is warned by others to get rid of the fish (when creatures with faces come out of the sea, there is a tsunami), he keeps the Princess, especially when she begins to turn into a little girl.  He calls her Ponyo, and soon Ponyo and Koichi are the bestest of friends.  Sadly, Ponyo's decision to leave her aquatic home sets the world off balance, and as the Moon is pulled closer to the Earth, the waters begin encroaching on the land with devastating force.At the core of this film is a beautiful story of friendship and love that blossoms between two souls; Ponyo and Koichi.  They share a need to escape their current predicaments.  Ponyo feels oppressed and conditioned by her father's fears and loathing and Koichi internalizes his feelings about his father being gone and his mother slipping into depression.  They use each other to forget about their worries and `be kids', which is such a beautiful sentiment used in this film.  Both Ponyo and Koichi just want to be kids.A shockingly rewarding film, `Ponyo' is one of the best animated films I've seen in a long time and is certainly a joy to be seen and remembered!",5,A magical little fish makes for a magical little movie...,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,1989,"['Japan', 'answer', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Ponyo', 'bit', 'enchanting', 'as', 'memorable', 'Disney', 'classic', 'sharply', 'used', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'look', 'wholly', 'nostalgic', ""n't"", 'average', '3D', 'CGI', 'spectacle', 'Ponyo', 'creates', 'something', 'original', 'authentic.The', 'film', 'young', 'Goldfish', 'Princess', 'who', 'washed', 'ashore', 'attempting', 'escape', 'domineering', 'control', 'human', 'father', 'evil', 'wizard', 'who', 'humankind', 'destroying', 'ocean', 'married', 'Ocean', 'queen', 'magnificent', 'being', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'levelheaded', 'endearing', 'husband', 'young', 'Princess', 'up', 'stuck', 'bottle', 'found', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Koichi', 'Koichi', 'living', 'alone', 'mother', 'father', 'sailor', 'away', 'work', 'Koichi', 'enamored', 'creature', 'fish', 'face', 'human', 'warned', 'others', 'get', 'rid', 'fish', 'when', 'creatures', 'come', 'sea', 'tsunami', 'Princess', 'especially', 'when', 'turn', 'little', 'girl', 'Ponyo', 'soon', 'Ponyo', 'Koichi', 'are', 'bestest', 'friends', 'Sadly', 'Ponyo', 'decision', 'leave', 'aquatic', 'home', 'world', 'balance', 'Moon', 'pulled', 'closer', 'Earth', 'waters', 'begin', 'encroaching', 'land', 'devastating', 'core', 'film', 'beautiful', 'story', 'friendship', 'love', 'blossoms', 'two', 'souls', 'Ponyo', 'Koichi', 'share', 'need', 'escape', 'current', 'predicaments', 'Ponyo', 'feels', 'oppressed', 'conditioned', 'father', 'fears', 'loathing', 'Koichi', 'feelings', 'father', 'being', 'gone', 'mother', 'slipping', 'depression', 'use', 'other', 'forget', 'worries', 'be', 'kids', 'beautiful', 'sentiment', 'used', 'film', 'Ponyo', 'Koichi', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'kids.A', 'shockingly', 'rewarding', 'film', 'Ponyo', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'certainly', 'joy', 'be', 'seen', 'remembered']",N/A
1314542,A4VH04TA14CPE,B002ZTQVBQ,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[1, 4]","Ponyo is perfect for children, and I'm not even a Miyazaki fan. I thought bothPrincess MononokeandSpirited Awaywere drawn out and excessively grotesque. But Ponyo is perfect. It finds a tone that is rare and priceless in children's movies. On one hand, it has a strong dramatic side, with exciting magical transformations and intense forces of nature. On the other hand, there is no antagonist, nobody in the film is evil. Ponyo's strict father is never really scary. His visual design makes him look like a stage magician or an eccentric inventor; it's easy to see that he's essentially kind. All the other characters are unreservedly good, even the grumpy old lady at the nursing home.Sure, at some point your kids will grow older, and then you'll have to teach them that the world isn't always (or ever) like this. For example, at some point you might show themGrave Of The Fireflies. But when they're really young, Ponyo is what they really need. There's enough action and adventure, so this isn't Barney, and some of the visuals are unworldly enough to keep the movie from being a syrupy cute-fest. But there's no fighting or cruelty, and the underlying message is decent and good for children. To find something else with those qualities, you'd have to go back to the oldMoominlandbooks.Additionally, the protagonist Sosuke is a fine example for children. He's not entirely quiet and obedient, but he loves both his parents very much. Even at his age, he already has a nascent sense of obligation. Adults talk to him in a way that makes him feel grown-up and responsible, asking him to protect his mother. He admires and tries to emulate his father (and there is a father -- he may be absent, but he works hard for his family). Lastly, he is admirably brave, venturing forth over a submerged seascape and into a dark tunnel and overcoming his fears.You can still see some of the rough edges that are present in all of Miyazaki's work. The storyline is a little loose. Why exactly does it upset the balance of the universe when a little goldfish decides to be human? I would have thought that the piles of underwater trash would do more harm in that regard. And what is exactly is the test that Sosuke is supposed to pass? We only see him going through the tunnel. Sosuke's father is transported to a strange place with countless other lost ships, but nothing is really ever made of this place, and he easily returns at the end. But in this film, all that might actually be for the best. All we really need to know is that Sosuke perceives that his father might be in danger and that he has to be responsible. Whether or not there is any actual danger is beside the point.Miyazaki's grotesque side also shows through when Ponyo grows ungainly chicken-like stick arms. But this, again, is temporary, and she gains a completely human appearance very shortly afterward. Quite harmless, compared to the half-hour long sequence of the masked being vomiting black goo in Spirited Away. It's eclipsed by the number of majestic visual set-pieces, like the colourful underwater parade at the beginning or Ponyo's chase after Sosuke (riding a school of giant liquid fish, no less) after becoming human.Ponyo herself is an old archetype of children's literature, the Magical Friend who is more powerful, outgoing and fun than the protagonist, yet utterly devoted to him, and often lacking in direction, only reaching her potential in the protagonist's presence (Astrid Lindgren had a lot of those characters -- recallPippiandKarlson). She does most of the work helping Sosuke find his mother, but only because Sosuke supplies the determination. She doesn't have a lot of personality other than enjoying ham, but again, this helps to make Sosuke responsible for his own decisions.You go through a dark tunnel, and at the end your father comes home and your mother gives you a hug and makes dessert for you, and even the unfriendly wizard turns out to be a fundamentally nice guy who even asks you to try to remember him warmly. As long as you love your parents and protect your friends, everything will turn out fine. All the time mankind spent making art and poetry, and that's still the purest image anyone ever came up with. You want your kids to grow up to be decent people, this is the first step.",5,Miyazaki's best -- idyllic but not excessively sugary.,1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,4295,"['Ponyo', 'perfect', 'children', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'Miyazaki', 'fan', 'thought', 'bothPrincess', 'MononokeandSpirited', 'Awaywere', 'drawn', 'out', 'excessively', 'grotesque', 'Ponyo', 'perfect', 'tone', 'rare', 'priceless', 'children', 'movies', 'one', 'hand', 'strong', 'dramatic', 'side', 'exciting', 'magical', 'transformations', 'intense', 'forces', 'nature', 'other', 'hand', 'antagonist', 'nobody', 'film', 'evil', 'Ponyo', 'strict', 'father', 'never', 'really', 'scary', 'visual', 'design', 'look', 'stage', 'magician', 'eccentric', 'inventor', 'easy', 'see', 'essentially', 'kind', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'unreservedly', 'good', 'even', 'grumpy', 'old', 'lady', 'nursing', 'home.Sure', 'point', 'kids', 'will', 'grow', 'older', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'teach', 'world', ""n't"", 'always', 'ever', 'example', 'point', 'might', 'show', 'themGrave', 'Fireflies', 'when', ""'re"", 'really', 'young', 'Ponyo', 'what', 'really', 'need', 'enough', 'action', 'adventure', ""n't"", 'Barney', 'visuals', 'are', 'unworldly', 'enough', 'keep', 'movie', 'being', 'syrupy', 'cute-fest', 'fighting', 'cruelty', 'underlying', 'message', 'decent', 'good', 'children', 'find', 'something', 'else', 'qualities', ""'d"", 'have', 'go', 'back', 'oldMoominlandbooks.Additionally', 'protagonist', 'Sosuke', 'fine', 'example', 'children', 'not', 'entirely', 'quiet', 'obedient', 'parents', 'very', 'much', 'Even', 'age', 'already', 'nascent', 'sense', 'obligation', 'Adults', 'talk', 'way', 'feel', 'grown-up', 'responsible', 'asking', 'protect', 'mother', 'tries', 'emulate', 'father', 'father', 'may', 'be', 'absent', 'hard', 'family', 'Lastly', 'admirably', 'brave', 'venturing', 'forth', 'submerged', 'seascape', 'dark', 'tunnel', 'overcoming', 'fears.You', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'rough', 'edges', 'are', 'present', 'Miyazaki', 'work', 'storyline', 'little', 'loose', 'Why', 'exactly', 'upset', 'balance', 'universe', 'when', 'little', 'goldfish', 'decides', 'be', 'human', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'piles', 'underwater', 'trash', 'would', 'do', 'more', 'harm', 'regard', 'what', 'exactly', 'test', 'Sosuke', 'supposed', 'pass', 'only', 'see', 'going', 'tunnel', 'Sosuke', 'father', 'transported', 'strange', 'place', 'countless', 'other', 'lost', 'ships', 'nothing', 'really', 'ever', 'made', 'place', 'easily', 'end', 'film', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'best', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'Sosuke', 'father', 'might', 'be', 'danger', 'be', 'responsible', 'not', 'actual', 'danger', 'point.Miyazaki', 'grotesque', 'side', 'also', 'when', 'Ponyo', 'ungainly', 'chicken-like', 'stick', 'arms', 'again', 'temporary', 'gains', 'completely', 'human', 'appearance', 'very', 'shortly', 'afterward', 'Quite', 'harmless', 'compared', 'half-hour', 'long', 'sequence', 'masked', 'being', 'vomiting', 'black', 'goo', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'eclipsed', 'number', 'majestic', 'visual', 'set-pieces', 'colourful', 'underwater', 'parade', 'beginning', 'Ponyo', 'chase', 'Sosuke', 'riding', 'school', 'giant', 'liquid', 'fish', 'less', 'becoming', 'human.Ponyo', 'old', 'archetype', 'children', 'literature', 'Magical', 'Friend', 'who', 'more', 'powerful', 'outgoing', 'fun', 'protagonist', 'yet', 'utterly', 'devoted', 'often', 'lacking', 'direction', 'only', 'reaching', 'potential', 'protagonist', 'presence', 'Astrid', 'Lindgren', 'had', 'lot', 'characters', 'recallPippiandKarlson', 'most', 'work', 'helping', 'Sosuke', 'find', 'mother', 'only', 'Sosuke', 'determination', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'personality', 'other', 'enjoying', 'ham', 'again', 'make', 'Sosuke', 'responsible', 'own', 'decisions.You', 'go', 'dark', 'tunnel', 'end', 'father', 'home', 'mother', 'hug', 'dessert', 'even', 'unfriendly', 'wizard', 'out', 'be', 'fundamentally', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'even', 'try', 'remember', 'warmly', 'As', 'long', 'love', 'parents', 'protect', 'friends', 'everything', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'fine', 'time', 'mankind', 'spent', 'making', 'art', 'poetry', 'still', 'purest', 'image', 'anyone', 'ever', 'came', 'up', 'want', 'kids', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'decent', 'people', 'first', 'step']",N/A
1314543,A30638B9S2GOM8,B002ZTQVBQ,apples2apples,"[0, 0]","Like all Miyazaki films, Ponyo is an adorable story - one you and your children are likely to remember for a lifetime. It's the story about a young goldfish who lives in the sea with many sisters, and her father, the alchemist, Fujimoto. Ponyo's mother is a beautiful sea goddess, Gran Mamare who seems to belong more to the sea than to her family, although she's there when they need her.Ponyo is a very curious goldfish, and one day, while out exploring, she gets stuck in a jar. The jar floats up along the shore, where a little boy, Sosuke, finds the jar, and tries to get Ponyo out. Fujimoto goes out in search of Ponyo when he realizes she's missing, and as Sosuke is running up the hill to his house - where his mother has been calling him, Fujimoto notices that Sosuke is carrying her. He panics because he's not very fond of people, and fears what will be done to his daughter. Oh...did I mention Fujimoto is a man?  LOL  I think they explained that a bit in the movie, but not in any great detail.After Sosuke finds Ponyo, she falls in love with her, and she wants to become a human girl. So that I don't ruin it all, I'll just tell you that the Sea Goddess has the power to make it happen, but it depends on whether Sosuke can love Ponya enough to make it happen.Ponyo is a wonderful movie - esp if you have children. We have kids ages 20 - 8, and they all will sit and watch a Miyazaki movie. Our first Miyazaki movie was ""Our Neighbor Totoro""My Neighbor Totoro (Two-Disc Special Edition)We first bought it in the VHS tape version, and later bought it in the DVD version - which we usually watch several times a year, and often take with us on vacation. Delightful is a perfect word to describe these movies.

1314545,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B002ZTQVBQ,Armando N. Roman,"[8, 8]","As soon as my daughter saw Ponyo, she fell in love with it. She loves My Neighbor Totoro, The Cat Returns, Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery Service, so this was pretty much a safe bet with her. Getting the movie's already a good deal, but the plush Ponyo included here is of great quality, and easily beats any other Studio Ghibli plush I've seen [at least here in the US].You can see right there in the stock picture how big Ponyo is since it's right next to the dvd in the packaging. It's made of a very soft, huggable material sure to comfort any child, and it's super cute. The material is easy to clean if anything gets dirty, and the construction is very sturdy. Of course there will be some issues with a longer 'skirt' here and there (that's quality control for you), but can you really turn away such a cute character even if it's suffering from such a thing? The plush Ponyo alone runs for about the cost of this set on most sites, so getting it included with the movie is great. While I would've liked them to give the blu-ray the same treatment, it's good to have on dvd since it's beautiful to watch on either format. And hey, most parents don't let 3 year olds handle 'expensive' movies, eh?The dvd includes the usual special features that other Studio Ghibli dvds have- an interview with Miyazaki, a short featurette and a storyboard presentation of the entire movie. This is always a very important special feature for those interested in animation, or like to see the movie in a different format and seeing how it came together before the animators stepped in.

1314546,A5EKUC02QJKWE,B002ZTQVBQ,"A. Rodriguez ""Kapuffy""","[0, 0]","Alright, I've heard many good reviews of Ponyo and a few negative ones. I can definitely see what there is to like, because there is much, but I also see where the film could have fallen short in the eyes of many viewers. I am not a strong fan of anime, but my friends are. I do like anime though; I think many artists and storytellers have achieved great things through their works in anime but, for me, nothing compares to the works of Hayao Miyazaki. He seems to capture a magic in his visuals paired with his song choices and overall tone. I am a huge fan of Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Howl's Moving Castle, and I have become a fan of Ponyo. The reason I give this movie four stars is not because I do not like it, but because I felt it wasn't as strong as Miyazaki's other films. The four stars is based on a comparison which I probably should not even have made. This is why I say: if you're buying Ponyo because you love Miyazaki and you love the intricate details in the storytelling as well as the epic storyline (like Princess Mononoke), you will not get it here. This movie is more contained, simpler. Does that make it a bad movie? Heck no! On the contrary, Ponyo's simplicity is what makes it so great. It is the kind of movie that tells a simple enough story, but manages to bombard your eyes with beautiful, colorful images that are not simplistic in any way. I do recommend this movie; but don't do what I did: don't go in there expecting a two hour epic anime like Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, because it is not those movies. Allow yourself to be taken in and don't expect too much, because sometimes too much is not a good thing. Ponyo is just enough.

1314547,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B002ZTQVBQ,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[40, 59]","I thought long and hard before giving the film this score, but there are simply too many things that make Ponyo not work for me. This latest animated movie from Myazaki, who needs no introductions, had the intriguing premise of the sea. He spoke of the sea being a character in itself. I was intrigued to see the movie. I knew it had two children as the frontline, but being a fan of My Neighbour Totoro, I knew that Myazaki has an unreal insight into the mindset of children.The very first scene of Ponyo is breathtaking. Hundreds of fishes and jellyfish accompanied by breathtaking, oceanic music, finally zooming in on a man in a pinstriped suit, creating a bubble around his ship. We later find out that he is the father of one of the main characters, the fish girl Ponyo who wants to become human after befriending Sotsuke, a 5-year old boy living in a house by the sea. She is able to do this with a mixture of her father's magic (which she's inherited) and Sotsuke's blood (a drop of which she licked when he cut himself).The problem with Ponyo is the vagueness of the story. There is practically no sense of conflict to the story at all. There is no substantial threat to the characters, and they have very little development. That the characters are so young shouldn't justify this, if we remember Mei in My Neighbour Totoro. Also, Ponyo's father is so at odds with practically everything in the movie's universe, it's hilarious and off-putting at the same time. Ponyo herself is, personally, creepy rather than cute (and her numerous little siblings are no different). I don't understand how nobody finds it peculiar that Ponyo, supposedly a goldfish, has a humanoid face (and Sotsuke shows her to quite a few people). It's even weirder when Lisa (Sotsuke's mother, whom he oddly always refers to by name), an intelligent woman, sees Ponyo eat a slice of ham in whole (as a goldfish) and isn't at all surprised about it. The only really developed character, and the warmest, is the grumpy old woman at the retirement home where Lisa works.What Ponyo lacks in substance, it makes up for in visuals. The movie's highlight in my opinion is where Lisa and Sotsuke are driving down a road continually drenched in waves, on top of which Ponyo is running. These waves take on the form of giant fish.  A wonderful piece of animation. The many underwater scenes are beautiful, with underwater creatures big and small swimming. Something about the overall production values of the visuals feel a bit unfocused, though. The morse code scene is then hilarious.On the whole, however, Ponyo feels like a lot of elements that just don't work together. Sotsuke faces no real trials like other young Myazaki protagonists have faced. None of the characters feel like they serve any real purpose other than to bring Sotsuke and Ponyo together. The film's subplot of Ponyo's magic causing a rift in the natural order and causing the moon to come closer (which explains the flood) is never sufficiently delivered to the audience.I was simply expecting a better delivery from a master storyteller like Myazaki. Ponyo may only really work for the smallest children, but that's excluding a large part of Myazaki's fanbase. He's one of those filmmakers whom I respect for continually showing people that animated movies can be for people of all ages. Ponyo obviously aims at a lower age group, but I just hope that the children will be more drawn into Sotsuke and Ponyo's story than I was (there is so much courteous and/or cute dialogue that I felt downright embarrassed at points).Decent, but definitely not the brightest spot in Myazaki's repertoire.",2,Unsatisfying,1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,3638,"['thought', 'long', 'hard', 'giving', 'film', 'score', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'make', 'Ponyo', 'not', 'work', 'latest', 'animated', 'movie', 'Myazaki', 'who', 'introductions', 'had', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'sea', 'spoke', 'sea', 'being', 'character', 'was', 'intrigued', 'see', 'movie', 'knew', 'had', 'two', 'children', 'frontline', 'being', 'fan', 'My', 'Neighbour', 'Totoro', 'knew', 'Myazaki', 'unreal', 'insight', 'mindset', 'children.The', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'Ponyo', 'breathtaking', 'Hundreds', 'fishes', 'jellyfish', 'accompanied', 'breathtaking', 'oceanic', 'music', 'finally', 'zooming', 'man', 'pinstriped', 'suit', 'creating', 'bubble', 'ship', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'father', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'fish', 'girl', 'Ponyo', 'who', 'become', 'human', 'befriending', 'Sotsuke', '5-year', 'old', 'boy', 'living', 'house', 'sea', 'able', 'do', 'mixture', 'father', 'magic', 'inherited', 'Sotsuke', 'blood', 'drop', 'licked', 'when', 'cut', '.The', 'problem', 'Ponyo', 'vagueness', 'story', 'practically', 'sense', 'conflict', 'story', 'substantial', 'threat', 'characters', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'development', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'young', 'should', ""n't"", 'justify', 'remember', 'Mei', 'My', 'Neighbour', 'Totoro', 'Also', 'Ponyo', 'father', 'so', 'odds', 'practically', 'everything', 'movie', 'universe', 'hilarious', 'off-putting', 'same', 'time', 'Ponyo', 'personally', 'rather', 'cute', 'numerous', 'little', 'siblings', 'are', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'nobody', 'Ponyo', 'supposedly', 'goldfish', 'humanoid', 'face', 'Sotsuke', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'even', 'weirder', 'when', 'Lisa', 'Sotsuke', 'mother', 'whom', 'oddly', 'always', 'refers', 'name', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'Ponyo', 'eat', 'slice', 'ham', 'whole', 'goldfish', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'only', 'really', 'developed', 'character', 'warmest', 'grumpy', 'old', 'woman', 'retirement', 'home', 'where', 'Lisa', 'works.What', 'Ponyo', 'substance', 'up', 'visuals', 'movie', 'highlight', 'opinion', 'where', 'Lisa', 'Sotsuke', 'are', 'driving', 'down', 'road', 'continually', 'drenched', 'waves', 'top', 'Ponyo', 'running', 'waves', 'take', 'form', 'giant', 'fish', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'animation', 'many', 'underwater', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'underwater', 'creatures', 'big', 'small', 'swimming', 'Something', 'overall', 'production', 'values', 'visuals', 'feel', 'bit', 'unfocused', 'though', 'morse', 'code', 'scene', 'then', 'hilarious.On', 'whole', 'however', 'Ponyo', 'lot', 'elements', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'together', 'Sotsuke', 'real', 'trials', 'other', 'young', 'Myazaki', 'protagonists', 'have', 'faced', 'None', 'characters', 'feel', 'serve', 'real', 'purpose', 'other', 'bring', 'Sotsuke', 'Ponyo', 'together', 'film', 'subplot', 'Ponyo', 'magic', 'causing', 'rift', 'natural', 'order', 'causing', 'moon', 'come', 'closer', 'flood', 'never', 'sufficiently', 'delivered', 'audience.I', 'was', 'simply', 'expecting', 'better', 'delivery', 'master', 'storyteller', 'Myazaki', 'Ponyo', 'may', 'only', 'really', 'work', 'smallest', 'children', 'excluding', 'large', 'part', 'Myazaki', 'fanbase', 'one', 'filmmakers', 'whom', 'respect', 'continually', 'showing', 'people', 'animated', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'people', 'ages', 'Ponyo', 'obviously', 'lower', 'age', 'group', 'just', 'hope', 'children', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'drawn', 'Sotsuke', 'Ponyo', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'courteous', 'cute', 'dialogue', 'felt', 'downright', 'embarrassed', 'points', '.Decent', 'definitely', 'not', 'brightest', 'spot', 'Myazaki', 'repertoire']",N/A
1314548,AGG9C66TOLJZB,B002ZTQVBQ,"A. Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[7, 18]","Ponyo has about the most beautiful animation I have ever seen in a movie. It is simply stunning. It seems to live in a world somewhere between Anime and Japanese woodcuts. The large stunning blocks of vibrant colour almost live in themselves and most of the actual things which are chosen to be animated are stunning to - however this does little to hide what seems to be a stilted story which I feel sure has lost something in the translation both of language and culture from Japanese to English.This is the retold tale, Japanese style, of the little mermaid. Brunhilde is the daughter of a mad scientist and the sea/earth mother. She is a fish like creature who lives in her father's ship in a bubble under the sea. But she wants more, and in the opening scenes escapes inside a jellyfish, the most beautiful scene to open a movie with.She ends up being saved from certain death by a little boy, Sosuke, who takes her to school but loses her back to the sea in a rather child-frightening scene where the scientist summons up some fierce and sinister looking waves.Ponyo (or Brunhilda to her father) returns to Sosuke determined to be a girl. She drinks her father's elixirs and unbalances the world in the process. The tsunami scenes are both fearfully frightening again for some young children, and hilarious - Ponyo - now a little girl runs along the top of the waves.It all is resolved and the earth mother talks to Sosuke's mother and Sosuke says he will love Ponyo forever and all is well with the world again.The story just didn't seem to flow. The mother and earth mother talking for long hours. The Old lady who refused to go under water and is taken down anyway, Sosuke and Ponyo's long, seemingly pointless trip in the boat. The very strange prehistoric fish which swim, seemingly threateningly, under their boat. And why does Sosuke say ""pre-cambrian"". I know what Pre-Cambrian is, but is there a point that they are there? Is there a point that he knows? why aren't there just fish there? Is this because the balance of the world is out? But then why does Sosuke, a 5 year old know?Sorry, but for me the movie was full of these sort of questions. What was this or that all about? Some is explained but very often I think there is something really important been missed out somehow.Anyway. It was an all right movie to watch. My 7 year old quite liked it, the 6 year old found it very frightening, and I found it frustrating and full of unexplained things.",3,"Astonishingly Beautiful Animation, an ok Story, but quite scary for young kids",1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,2470,"['Ponyo', 'most', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'simply', 'stunning', 'live', 'world', 'somewhere', 'Anime', 'Japanese', 'woodcuts', 'large', 'stunning', 'blocks', 'vibrant', 'colour', 'almost', 'live', 'most', 'actual', 'things', 'are', 'chosen', 'be', 'animated', 'are', 'stunning', 'however', 'little', 'hide', 'what', 'be', 'stilted', 'story', 'feel', 'sure', 'lost', 'something', 'translation', 'language', 'culture', 'Japanese', 'English.This', 'retold', 'tale', 'Japanese', 'style', 'little', 'mermaid', 'Brunhilde', 'daughter', 'mad', 'scientist', 'sea/earth', 'mother', 'fish', 'creature', 'who', 'father', 'ship', 'bubble', 'sea', 'more', 'opening', 'scenes', 'escapes', 'jellyfish', 'most', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'open', 'movie', 'with.She', 'up', 'being', 'saved', 'certain', 'death', 'little', 'boy', 'Sosuke', 'who', 'school', 'back', 'sea', 'rather', 'child-frightening', 'scene', 'where', 'scientist', 'up', 'fierce', 'sinister', 'looking', 'waves.Ponyo', 'Brunhilda', 'father', 'Sosuke', 'determined', 'be', 'girl', 'father', 'elixirs', 'world', 'process', 'tsunami', 'scenes', 'are', 'fearfully', 'frightening', 'again', 'young', 'children', 'hilarious', 'Ponyo', 'now', 'little', 'girl', 'top', 'waves.It', 'resolved', 'earth', 'mother', 'talks', 'Sosuke', 'mother', 'Sosuke', 'will', 'love', 'Ponyo', 'forever', 'well', 'world', 'story', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'flow', 'mother', 'earth', 'mother', 'talking', 'long', 'hours', 'Old', 'lady', 'who', 'refused', 'go', 'water', 'taken', 'down', 'anyway', 'Sosuke', 'Ponyo', 'long', 'seemingly', 'pointless', 'trip', 'boat', 'very', 'strange', 'prehistoric', 'fish', 'swim', 'seemingly', 'threateningly', 'boat', 'why', 'Sosuke', 'say', 'pre-cambrian', 'know', 'what', 'Pre-Cambrian', 'there', 'point', 'are', 'there', 'there', 'point', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'just', 'fish', 'there', 'balance', 'world', 'out', 'then', 'why', 'Sosuke', '5', 'year', 'old', 'know', 'Sorry', 'movie', 'was', 'full', 'sort', 'questions', 'What', 'was', 'explained', 'very', 'often', 'think', 'something', 'really', 'important', 'been', 'missed', 'out', 'somehow.Anyway', 'was', 'right', 'movie', 'watch', '7', 'year', 'old', 'quite', 'liked', '6', 'year', 'old', 'found', 'very', 'frightening', 'found', 'frustrating', 'full', 'unexplained', 'things']",N/A

""raven cat""","[3, 4]","As a long time fan of Hayao Miyazaki, I was overjoyed when I learned that he had created yet another one of his masterpieces, and now it's going to be released at the beginning of next month!I actually had the chance to watch the full movie before I bought it,  and I have to say it's just as charming, sweet and at the same time entertaining as any other of his masterpieces. In fact, I am in college and I'd rather watch this movie than Princess Mononoke sometimes (even though Princess Mononoke was a stellar film also). Once again we see that he has placed an ecological lesson for us in the guise of a children's movie which is wonderfully delightful if you're a grown up kid as well. That's perhaps the best part of this movie: it doesn't just entertain, but it brings up important issues that we in the real world cannot afford to ignore.Ponyo is not only irresistibly adorable, she is a very determined little goldfish whose desire is to be human, which I think too many people take for granted. FIve year old Sosuke is beyond precious in his efforts to take care of Ponyo, and both children can bring you back to a time when everything was much simpler.And then of course, there's the part that Miyazaki-sensei is known for more than anything: the sheer beauty of his work. Even though this is a children's movie, no corners were cut in the animation of this film, in my opinion.  Just the opening scene alone of the jelly fish rising in the ocean is mesmerizing to say the least.Now having said that, I only have one warning: DON'T LISTEN TO THE DUB!Well, the Disney dub was at best OKAY, but it was certainly no substitute for the original actors.To conclude without revealing too much, this movie is a must have for any Hayao Miyazaki fan, or anybody who's never even heard of him before.",5,"If you like Hayao Miyazaki, YOU HAVE TO BUY PONYO~!!!!!!!",1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,1800,"['long', 'time', 'fan', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'when', 'learned', 'had', 'created', 'yet', 'one', 'masterpieces', 'now', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'beginning', 'next', 'month', 'actually', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'full', 'movie', 'bought', 'have', 'say', 'just', 'charming', 'sweet', 'same', 'time', 'entertaining', 'other', 'masterpieces', 'fact', 'am', 'college', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'movie', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'sometimes', 'even', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'was', 'stellar', 'film', 'also', 'Once', 'again', 'see', 'placed', 'ecological', 'lesson', 'guise', 'children', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'delightful', ""'re"", 'grown', 'up', 'kid', 'as', 'well', 'perhaps', 'best', 'part', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'entertain', 'up', 'important', 'issues', 'real', 'world', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'ignore.Ponyo', 'not', 'only', 'irresistibly', 'adorable', 'very', 'determined', 'little', 'goldfish', 'desire', 'be', 'human', 'think', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'take', 'granted', 'FIve', 'year', 'old', 'Sosuke', 'precious', 'efforts', 'take', 'care', 'Ponyo', 'children', 'can', 'bring', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'everything', 'was', 'much', 'simpler.And', 'then', 'course', 'part', 'Miyazaki-sensei', 'known', 'more', 'anything', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'work', 'Even', 'children', 'movie', 'corners', 'were', 'cut', 'animation', 'film', 'opinion', 'Just', 'opening', 'scene', 'alone', 'jelly', 'fish', 'rising', 'ocean', 'mesmerizing', 'say', 'least.Now', 'having', 'said', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'warning', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'LISTEN', 'TO', 'THE', 'DUB', 'Well', 'Disney', 'dub', 'was', 'best', 'OKAY', 'was', 'certainly', 'substitute', 'original', 'actors.To', 'conclude', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'fan', 'anybody', 'who', 'never', 'even', 'heard']",N/A

Helmed by Academy Award-winning director Hayao Miyazaki, at the Japanese animation film Studio Ghibli, this astonishing movie follows the tradition established by Miyazaki and Ghibli, with wonderful animated films like ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" and ""Castle in the Sky.""One of the main characters in the story is Sosuke, a happy kid who spends his day going to school and returning home with his mother Risa, who works in a senior-care facility, which is located next door to Sosuke's school. His father, a sailor, is seldom home because his job is very time-demanding. Their house is located on a cliff in a picturesque Japanese coastal fishing village. One day, Sosuke discovers what appears to be or looks like a goldfish at the beach downhill from his house. He picks it up, puts it in a bucket with water, and names her Ponyo. However, it happens that Ponyo is the daughter of a powerful wizard and a sea Goddess.With time, the wizard takes Ponyo away from Sosuke, which breaks her heart because she loves Sosuke - and she also wants to become a human.  She escapes from her father's custody, unleashing drastic changes on our planet as a result, causing tsunamis, sending earth into pre-historic times (with its fauna and flora), and getting the moon very close to the earth, leading to possible, eventual crash. Only true love will allow the balance of nature to be restored.""Ponyo"" is just awesome. The animation is mesmerizing, as well as its attention to detail. Based on Hans Christian Andersen's classic `The Little Mermaid,"" this is a film that all the family will treasure for generations to come.  The fantastic Blue-ray edition includes documentaries in which the world of the Ghibli Studios and the film's characters are profiled, interactive games, and more. A DVD copy of the movie is provided on a second disc. In addition to PONYO, the Disney Studios also released DVD editions of ""MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO,"" ""CASTLE IN THE SKY,"" and ""KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE"" on March 2, 2010.

For every bit of weirdness here, it has an internal consistency that makes it work. And, like all of Hayao Miyazaki's film, it is incredibly cute, whether you are a child or an adult. Also like Miyazaki's other films, the animation is a spectacle in itself, as beautiful and breathtaking as any live action film. This is a wonderful movie.Second, the plush doll. It's just good.

Only French or American dubs on the Blu-Ray. And the American dub is NOT good.  There are a few good voice over roles, but the instant Ponyo starts talking, it's like nails on a chalkboard.  So I wanted to hear the original Japanese.  Hum...So I checked the box, and it listed Japanese audio for the 2nd disc.  DVD.  Not Blu-Ray.  Hum...  So then I put that disc in.  And found that I could not switch automatically to the Japanese.  I had to go through several menus, then restart the film.  Then skip manually to the chapter I wanted.  Then the subtitles were off (knowing quite a bit of Japanese, this was obvious), so luckily I was able to put the correct subtitles on (instead of captions).A one star rating is kind of harsh, but I balanced the rating out to two stars.  It really deserves one star because:YOU CANNOT WATCH PONYO ON BLU-RAY WITH THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE AUDIO!!!!So that makes getting the Blu-Ray version of Ponyo a huge mistake for purists or true foreign film aficionados.  The other reason that I gave a one star rating is that the film isn't good enough to warrant raising the star rating.  I would give the film 3 stars normally if not for the huge slap in the face to those of us wanting Blu-Ray quality with the lossless Japanese audio.  Being a huge fan of Miyazaki, I can see that perhaps his creativity began running in a different direction in the end.  This was his last directed film, and though it was a decent film, even the newer Ghibli film Arietty (written by Miyazaki but not directed by) was much better.  It's not a bad film, just Miyazaki's weakest link.  Compared to his other masterpieces: Nasuicaa, Totoro, Laputa (Castle in the Sky), Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle, one can safely say this film falls short compared to all of these.It's a film about love and friendship, and it seems to start as a film against humanity's pollution of the seas.  But this never really pans out other than a few early shots.  It's the lack of depth that is the problem; the deeper and more complex stories are what raised the bar of his previous films.  In the end, Totoro is probably the most complex film with the subtle and hidden meanings which remind me of Spirit of the Beehive and Pan's Labrynth (and better than Pan's I think).  Kiki might have more in common with Ponyo than the other films do, but even Kiki has a little more to it, and more likable characters.The animation was stunning.  I liked that Miyazaki wanted to go back to colorful, hand drawn animation with storybook looking backgrounds.  This was a huge plus.  But the positives can't outweigh the negatives.Film - 3 starsFailing to include the lossless Japanese audio on the Blu-Ray - 1 starIf you want to see the Japanese audio, then save money and get the DVD only.

Though it is slightly more childish and innocent than Miyazaki's other stories, it was a pure delight!As I suspected, Ponyo is loosely based on The Little Mermaid. She is a little fish who washes up on shore to have a young boy discover and befriend her. Sosuke and Ponyo soon become very close friends and they share an innocent love for each other. But Ponyo longs to be human (hence the little mermaid reference) and her father, Fujimoto, who watches over the sea, is worried this transformation will upset the balance of nature. Sosuke must prove his love for Ponyo for things to go unscathed.Obviously what makes this movie is the beautiful artwork. It is so imaginative and breathtaking; half the time I was simply admiring the art. The story is very different from Miyazaki's other films. Whereas Spirited Away is more of a lesson and a deep, moving, story, Ponyo is much more lighthearted and fun. I could not stop laughing throughout the movie!! When Ponyo yells HAM you will laugh just as hard, trust me.

1314567,AR06Z1UFUS5BE,B002ZTQVBQ,David B. Harrington,"[1, 1]","I was introduced to the works of Director, Hayao Miyazaki less than a decade ago. At first glance, his work may seem ""different"". My first experience with Miyazaki's work came with the best animated film of 2002, ""Spirited Away"". I have to admit, this is not the best film to use as a doorway into the world of Ghibli, as ""Spirited Away"" rides that ""different"" line a lot harder than most of his work. However, after my next experience, ""My Neighbor Totoro"", I was completely hooked. These are films that, when watched with unclouded vision, will open up your movie world to a whole other arena you never imagined possible. I am more calm and relaxed when I watch a Miyazaki film, than when I watch any other Director's work. There is a serenity present in the worlds he creates that cannot be found anywhere else.""Ponyo"" is no exception, and in fact may be the piece that best represents that feeling I have when watching a Miyazaki film. The colors are vibrant, and the animation pristine. There is incredible value given to the art of traditional hand-drawn animation. It begs the question to enter our minds as to why that form of art has been, for the most part, abandoned. The music, (from composer Joe Hisaishi) is transcending. Mr. Hisaishi is to Hayao Miyazaki what John Williams is to Steven Spielberg. The marriage of their work is meant to be.I cherish the innocence of the story. The characters, while experiencing extraordinary things, remain emotionally deep, and memorable. The scenery is as inviting as ever. You feel at times, as if you have become a permanent part of what you are viewing. It leaves the realm of animated film, and becomes something real, if only inside of you.This is Miyazaki at his absolute best.

1314568,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B002ZTQVBQ,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[14, 23]","[FOREWORD: Boy, did I have an amusing theatrical experience.  When I was going to the theater to see this film, I went inside the auditorium, and there were actually children watching an anime movie for once. I must say it's rather appropriate, but at the same time, I then had to deal with their constant whining and begging for mom's milk during the film's important scenes.  Truthfully, they didn't bother me too much as their distractions didn't ruin my movie experience in any way.]Oh, Miyazaki.  You never let me down...until now, but only a bit.  A slight bit, a minute splinter under my skin...yet it still bothers me.  When I read about ""Ponyo"", the next Studio Ghibli project, I wasn't too impressed.  The film didn't look like it'll rekindle the flame that Miyazaki'saward-winning filmsparked, and its sole objective is to appeal to the general audience; to Disney's marketing-focus credit, the film did manage to do okay in the U.S. box office.  My admiration for the director usually does away with my negative first impressions, so I watched ""Ponyo"" with my mind as clear as the open sky.The story is an amalgamation ofcertainfairytaleswith a touch of ""An Inconvenient Truth.""  It's straightforward: boy meets girl fish, girl fish loves boy, girl fish wants to be human like boy, girl fish becomes human, then the ocean ecosystem is disrupted, causing damage beyond geological proportions due to the actions of girl fish.  A simple tale, indeed.  Usually, the premise screams out thrills, suspense, and a compelling adventure, but color me surprised because the movie doesn't have any; it has the adventure part, but it wasn't all that exciting which sadly reinforces my initial impressions.Although I try my best to suspend disbelief, I did unsuspend when the human characters aren't so bothered by the unusual chain of events.  Sosuke, the male lead, I can believe due to his youth and innocence, but his mother seems all too humble about the sight of a goldfish WITH A HUMAN FACE AND EATS HAM IN ONE BITE; I don't know about her, but I would be amazed by that.  The rest of villagers acted the same way (not just for the fish), in fact, the only character I can identify with is the cranky old lady because even she notices something is wrong with this whole thing.Ponyo herself is an intriguing character, though.  Although the US trailers did their very poorest to hide her human form (the trailers for ""The Last Unicorn"" and even ""Shrek II"" kept that surprise hidden), when she became one, she possesses magic that does unusual things: she can make things five times its size, she can cure the sick by rubbing her face on their faces, not to mention she can control the ocean if she likes.  She's a flipping miracle worker, a divine creature whom I am totally not comparing to certainreligiousfigures.  Conversely, her mother, The Goddess of the Sea, provides no significant purpose for the whole film.  She was mentioned as a serious threat, but all she did was play a beautiful spectator.  Another thing, if she's the Goddess of the Sea, why didn't she stop that tsunami her daughter is causing?  What, was she wasting time at home watching Grey's Anatomy or the show's equivalent in Japan?I'm aware this isn't the type of Ghibli film that would tug my heartstrings with the characters' obstacles for them to walk the path of self-worth.  This is a lighter film, something for everyone who's afraid of a little danger.  There were previous Ghibli films that were also light in tone, but this film neither has the obstruction of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" nor the wonder of ""My Neighbor Totoro.""  There was a lot of magic, but not a lot of mystery; the movie constantly shows off on its vibrant displays that there's no subtlety.  Some circumstances, such as the elixir scene and the caution about the moon falling, were abruptly told just to keep the momentum.Personally, these young leads didn't really learn anything from their experience.  Ponyo's wizard of a father said Sosuke must overcome a challenge to test his love for Ponyo, but I don't know what challenge it is; all I saw was those two walking in a tunnel.  Finally, there was the climax which was really a simple ""yes or no"" question, something the kid could've answered 30 minutes ago because he sure he didn't act any different than he was at this point.  Also, outside of the scene where Sosuke's mom acts like a proper parent and drive flooded roads during a heavy tsunami with her son unbuckled (mother of the year), the film lack any kind of tension as the film rather sails away for a good second-half, literally.  I know this is a G-rated movie, but come on, at least startle me a bit.To its merit, ""Ponyo"" is amazing to look at; the use of watercolors is simply exquisite, so kids are going to like what they see.  However, I don't praise a film for looks like I used to.  Sometimes, I want something more from my film than just how it dresses itself.  The story isn't enlightening to grab my attention, the characters weren't interesting to grow attached to them, and I felt indifferent about the marvels it showed.  Even as an animated film by Hayao Miyazaki, I can't give it a free pass.By the way, Disney. That Ponyo theme remix...shame on you.",3,Apathy on the Cliff by the Sea,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,5242,"['[', 'FOREWORD', 'Boy', 'did', 'have', 'amusing', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'When',

1314569,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002ZTQVBQ,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[53, 57]","In 2008, Studio Ghibli released their latest Hayao Miyazaki film ""Ponyo"" (aka ""Gake no Ue no Ponyo"") in Japan and followed with a U.S. release in August 2009.  The film which is Miyazaki's eighth film for Studio Ghibli has amassed several awards including the Japanese Academy Prize for Animation of the Year.  The film which is budgeted around $34 million dollars made over $199 million worldwide.  Where his 1988 film ""My Neighbor Totoro"" was Miyazaki's tale for older children, this time around for ""Ponyo"" he wanted to create a film for young children and was inspired from Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Little Mermaid"".VIDEO:Magical, beautiful and everything that you can expect from Hayao Miyazaki.  I was completely in awe when I watched this film.  In this day and age, we tend to put so much into CG animated films and rarely do we see hand drawn quality animation anymore.  I'm so glad that Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli continues to show this creative style through this film. The hand painted backgrounds are absolutely beautiful, the character design continues that Miyazaki look and style but looks absolutely fluid during its more action-oriented scenes.Presented in 1080p High Definition, detail can be seen on the painted backgrounds.  Vibrant during the day scenes with trees that are full of detail and water reflecting the trees, cliffs showcasing the detail as shadows and detail showcasing the curvature and the little pieces of grass that are placed within the rocks.  The scene with the storm and the crashing features Miyazaki's handiwork as he created the water and his waves all by himself.  It's an amazing sight to see.There are no compression artifacts, edge enhancement, aliasing, banding or any problems in picture quality for ""Ponyo"" whatsoever.  ""Ponyo"" achieves perfection!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Ponyo"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and in Japanese and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  First the good.  The English dub track is fantastic.  You want an immersive soundscape, ""Ponyo"" delivers.  From the sound of the ocean, bubbles popping, the rush of the waves, the sounds of trees rustling, the sound of rain, sea animals swimming in the water and most of all, a beautiful musical score by Joe Hisaishi.  This soundtrack is absolutely divine.  Great use of front and center channels with dialogue and music that is crystal clear.  The surround channels and the use of LFE as the sound effects bring ""Ponyo"" to life.  This lossless soundtrack is perfect!Now the bad.  There is no lossless Japanese audio soundtrack.  The Japanese Blu-ray release has a lossless soundtrack but what happened to it for this Blu-ray release?  There is no doubt that audiophile purists who want the original Japanese soundtrack are going to be upset by this and one can hope that if Disney does bring out a Miyazaki release on Blu-ray in the near future, that a lossless soundtrack is included for both the English and Japanese audio.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Ponyo"" has a good number of special features in 1080p High Definition and 480i Standard Definition.  Audio is in English 2.0 Dolby Digital and subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Special features include:* Meet Ponyo - (3:22) Executive producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy talk about working with Hayao Miyazaki and give a quick introduction to ""Ponyo"".* Original Japanese Storyboards - Watch the entire film but this time with the video showcasing the original storyboards.* A Conversation with Hayao Miyazaki & John Lasseter - (3:31) PIXAR's John Lasseter and a friend of Hayao Miyazaki talk about ""Ponyo"".* Creating Ponyo - (3:58) Hayao Miyazaki talks about how he came up with the concept of ""Ponyo"" and him wanting to create a film for children.* Ponyo & Fujimoto - (2:59) Hayao Miyazaki talks about the name ""Ponyo"" and the character Fujimoto.* The Nursery - (2:00) Studio Ghibli Producer Toshio Suzuki talks about Miyazaki wanting to create a children's nursery and both men made Miyazaki's dream happen by creating the Studio Ghibli Nursery.* Producer's Perspective: Telling the Story- (2:27) Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki talks about how Miyazaki works and creating the storyboards and story for ""Ponyo"" and more.* The Locations of Ponyo - (9:32) An excerpt from a Japanese documentary on Miyazaki's animated films and visiting the areas that inspired Miyazaki to create the village of ""Ponyo"".* Scoring Miyazaki - (7:19) A featurette about Joe Hisaishi's scoring Miyazaki films and more.* Original Japanese Trailer - (3:22) The original Japanese theatrical trailers.* Behind the Microphone - (6:04) Featuring the English dub voice talent talking about their role, their appreciation for Miyazaki and his films and interviews with the All-star talent.* My Neighbor Totoro - Creating My Neighbor Totoro - (3:00) Miyazaki talking about the creation of his film ""My Neighbor Totoro"".* Kiki's Delivery Service - Creating Kiki's Delivery Service -  (2:27) Hayao Miyazaki discussing the creation of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and what inspired Miyazaki for the creation of the city in the film.* Castle in the Sky: Character Sketches - (2:37) Miyazaki talks about the characters of ""Castle in the Sky"" and discussing how his audiences are loyal to his films over time.* Enter the Lands - Visit the land featuring various small animated Studio Ghibli characters (from all films).  Click on a character from that film (note: only ""Ponyo"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Castle in the Sky"" are available) to get a Q&A; or a small video info. of that film and its characters.EXTRAS:A DVD of ""Ponyo"" is included with this Blu-ray release.  The DVD is in Widescreen (1:85:1) - Enhanced for 169 Televisions, English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, Japanese and French with subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.JUDGMENT CALL:Once again, Miyazaki continues to prove to us that hand-drawn animation is absolutely beautiful and there is no need to join the pack and create a CG animated film.  ""Ponyo"" succeeds on all levels - storyline, animation, music and its soundtrack.  I absolutely loved this film!Before I saw the film, I figured that people were so used to Miyazaki's more serious work and for him to try to go back to something similar to ""My Neighbor Totoro"" was going to be difficult in this day and age but with ""Ponyo"", he managed to pull it off.  The world he creates is magical, the characters are just enjoyable to watch.  From every scene, I was literally just loving the animation and the painted backgrounds and to find out that Miyazaki actually drew the sea and the waves himself using 170,000 separate images is amazing.In terms of any deep messages on society or ecology, in ""Ponyo"", we see how trash and waste has been collecting on the ocean floors and Ponyo being stuck in a bottle lying in a wasteland under the sea.  For Fujimoto, as he tries to maneuver underwater, waste and garbage is everywhere.  So, it was great to see Miyazaki convey how people have mistreated the ocean with their garbage and incorporating it to the storyline.The Blu-ray is absolutely beautiful when it comes to picture quality, lossless audio and also contains a good number of special features.  If there was only one thing that prevents this Blu-ray release from reaching perfection is the lack of a lossless Japanese audio soundtrack.  But both English and Japanese vocals are well-done with the English track featuring all-star talent with Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, Cate Blanchett, Betty White, Cloris Leachmen, Lily Tomlin and Matt Damon providing their voices for this film.  Even Jonas Brothers sibling Frankie Jonas (as Sosuke) and Miley's younger sister Noah (as Ponyo) do a great job as the primary vocals.  The Japanese soundtrack features two of Japan's top celebrities with George Tokoro lending his voice for Fujimoto and Tomoko Yamaguchi as Lisa.  And also Hiroki Doi (Sosuke) and Yuria Nana (Ponyo) do a wonderful job providing the main voices for the Japanese audio track as well.Overall, Hayao Miyazaki is truly a remarkable filmmaker and ""Ponyo"" is a true masterpiece.  Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli show no signs of waning and they manage to capture the magic that I have felt when I was younger when I first watched Ghibli classics such as ""Nausicaa"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"".  This Blu-ray release is highly recommended!",4,Blu-ray: A magnificent Blu-ray release that misses perfection due to the lack of the lossless Japanese audio track,1267488000,"03 2,

1314570,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B002ZTQVBQ,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 1]","""Ponyo""Directed by Hayao Miyazaki  (2008)-----------------------------------------I had the good fortune to see this film in a large, modern movie theatre, with a lot of little kids in the audience for a mid-afternoon matinee showing. It was a great movie, totally ""age appropriate"" for the enchanted five- and six-year olds, as well as their appreciative adult attendants. Miyazaki's films can sometimes be a little too weird or sinister for this age group, but this time he managed to temper his dark side a bit and make a film that still celebrates nature and respects its dangerous side, while not also creeping the bejeezus out of little viewers.The film is set by the oceanside, and this wave-washed setting affords Miyazaki many opportunities to evoke the power of the natural world, as well as to frequently overwhelm the viewer's senses. (It was gorgeous and evocative on the big screen; I wonder how much of this will translate to video...)  Although some of Miyazaki's older fans may grumble about him babying-down his material, ""Ponyo"" is clearly a great film, probably better than naysayers might think, and certainly one of the best films made for small children in the last twenty or thirty years. The character animation is a bit rough, but the backgrounds and overall design of the film are rich, sensual and majestic, and Miyazaki's key themes come through loud and clear. Highly recommended!

Hayao Miyazaki may be the greatest animator in the world, his films combines beautiful, detailed hand-drawn backgrounds and stories that engage you with excellent stories and great characters. The films that I've seen so far are My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and Ponyo (all excellent).I've read some reviews that this is a light effort from Miyazaki. I disagree. I think that the master animator divides into two categories: the all innocent, sweet and simple films (My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service and Ponyo) and the much more complex, ambigous ones (Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, Porco Rosso, Mononoke, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle). Both categories are excellent in their own right and serve to satisfy people of all ages.Ponyo is an excellent film. Here in Ecuador unfortunately Disney understandably does not release Studio Ghibli films in theaters. While that's a shame, I understand that this films are not all quite embraced by the public in the West (although their following is increasing), so I have to buy it through Amazon. I was impressed by the beautifullness of the film. From the beginning it takes your breath away by showing you stunning scenes of the sea and the land. The story is really simple but I think that is one of the many strengths of the film. The characters are great and the two children behave properly as five year old should. Miyazaki takes inspiration in The Little Mermaid but give the film his own identity which we all have learn to love.Ponyo is a sweet, simple, beautiful film that will lift your spirits and will make you smile thoughout it and after it. 5 stars.

I love how Hayao has stuck to his guns and continued with the traditional hand drawn animation in this day and age of computer generated images. His latest film is PONYO. I just caught a viewing of the film. Unfortunately the version I saw was the english dubbed version but I guess that was intended to attract a larger audience. Small children probably wouldn't want to deal with subtitles.Anyhoo...the story of PONYO is pretty simple. Ponyo (Noah Cyrus, Miley's younger sister) is a goldfish who wants to become human after she meets Sosuke (Frankie Jonas) and becomes his friend. The basic friendship theme of the film reminded me a bit like another Miyazaki film MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. It is pretty obvious the audience Miyazaki was aiming for at the younger crowd but I saw plenty of adults without children at the theater I was at. As an adult, I loved the film. Sometimes it is good that a film isn't so heavy handed in subject matter like pollution like in Miyazaki's earlier films. Normally I prefer the Japanese version to the english version in Miyazaki's films but I honestly didn't mind it this time around except for Noah Cyrus who frankly is only famous because of her (no talent) father and older sister. I enjoyed the rest of the cast which includes Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, Betty White, Lily Tomlin, and Cloris Leachman.The only thing I really didn't care for about the film was the ending. The ending definitely could have been better. All in all though, the film was thoroughly entertaining.

1314575,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B002ZTQVBQ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Hayao Miyazaki is one of those rare directors who can take the magic of nature and childhood, then somehow capture it for the screen.And his tenth Ghibli movie ""Ponyo"" is no exception -- it's a reimagined tale of a ""little mermaid"" who wants to become human so she can be with a little human boy she loves. It's a simple story told in a simple manner (occasionally TOO simple), but it has a lush oceanic beauty and an innocent sweetness that really capture your heart and imagination.A little boy named Sosuke finds a tiny ""goldfish"" with a human face on a beach, trapped in a bottle. He names her Ponyo, and goes to great lengths to care for his little fishy friend.But then the sea wizard Fujimoto, Ponyo's overprotective dad, appears and snatches Ponyo back into the sea -- and she decides that she wants to become human so she can be with Sosuke. Having tasted a bit of Sosuke's blood, she sprouts chickenleggy limbs and starts to change, but inadvertently disrupts a magical well that causes the moon to drop, the seas to rise over the land, and prehistoric magic to rise once more.Sosuke and Ponyo are delighted to be reunited, despite the raging storm that is engulfing the city and causing ships to go missing. While the children go searching for Sosuke's missing mother, Fujimoto struggles to fix the balance of nature before the entire world is destroyed, with the help of Ponyo's sea goddess mother. The only hope of restoring balance lies in Ponyo and Sosuke -- and if Sosuke's love is not true, then Ponyo will be reduced to sea foam.Compared to Miyazaki's other movies, ""Ponyo"" is a very simple story -- it's basically a boy-meets-fishgirl story, with lots of children running around being adorable and exquisite looks at the sea. Even its theme is simple -- the story is dependent on on true selfless love and how it knows no boundaries of age, experience or even species. Not to mention parents letting go of their children.If there's a downside to the story, it's the lack of internal conflict. Example: the ""test"" that Fujimoto and the sea goddess use for Sosuke... well, it's far less impressive than it seems.And Miyazaki does not disappoint animationwise -- he conjures a waterworld of luminous sea life, sparkling ships, prehistoric creatures, finned submarines and a town that has been swallowed by the sea (complete with boats floating over the rooftops). It's an exquisite piece of work that turns the ocean into a magical, otherworldly realm where wizards work in coral-encrusted towers and shimmering jellyfish take little mermaids to the surface.Ponyo herself provides a lot of the movie's charm -- she's effusive, hyperactive, has a babylike fascination with the human world (""HAM!""), and an array of handy magical powers. Sosuke is a likable lad who is fascinated by Ponyo and her world, and Fujimoto makes a enjoyable anti-hero -- spindly, gaunt and with a mane of messy red hair, he's like a rock'n'roll embodiment of parental stress.As for this particular edition, it comes with a plushie ""fish"" Ponyo -- very cute and fuzzy, and an appropriate addition to the DVD. After all, if it's more childlike, why not include a toy?""Ponyo"" is simpler and more childlike fare than most of Miyazaki's past films, but it's still a sweet and lushly-animated piece of work. At the very least, it will transport you to a magical childhood.",5,Ponyo loves Sosuke!,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,3357,"['Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'one', 'rare', 'directors', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'magic', 'nature', 'childhood', 'then', 'somehow', 'capture', 'screen.And', 'tenth', 'Ghibli', 'movie', 'Ponyo', 'exception', 'reimagined', 'tale', 'little', 'mermaid', 'who', 'become', 'human', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'human', 'boy', 'simple', 'story', 'told', 'simple', 'manner', 'occasionally', 'TOO', 'simple', 'lush', 'oceanic', 'beauty', 'innocent', 'sweetness', 'really', 'capture', 'heart', 'imagination.A', 'little', 'boy', 'named', 'Sosuke', 'tiny', 'goldfish', 'human', 'face', 'beach', 'trapped', 'bottle', 'Ponyo', 'great', 'lengths', 'care', 'little', 'fishy', 'friend.But', 'then', 'sea', 'wizard', 'Fujimoto', 'Ponyo', 'overprotective', 'dad', 'snatches', 'Ponyo', 'back', 'sea', 'become', 'human', 'can', 'be', 'Sosuke', 'Having', 'tasted', 'bit', 'Sosuke', 'blood', 'chickenleggy', 'limbs', 'change', 'inadvertently', 'magical', 'well', 'moon', 'drop', 'seas', 'rise', 'land', 'prehistoric', 'magic', 'rise', 'once', 'more.Sosuke', 'Ponyo', 'are', 'delighted', 'be', 'reunited', 'raging', 'storm', 'engulfing', 'city', 'causing', 'ships', 'go', 'missing', 'children', 'go', 'searching', 'Sosuke', 'missing', 'mother', 'Fujimoto', 'fix', 'balance', 'nature', 'entire', 'world', 'destroyed', 'help', 'Ponyo', 'sea', 'goddess', 'mother', 'only', 'hope', 'restoring', 'balance', 'lies', 'Ponyo', 'Sosuke', 'Sosuke', 'love', 'not', 'true', 'then', 'Ponyo', 'will', 'be', 'reduced', 'sea', 'foam.Compared', 'Miyazaki', 'other', 'movies', 'Ponyo', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'basically', 'boy-meets-fishgirl', 'story', 'lots', 'children', 'running', 'around', 'being', 'adorable', 'exquisite', 'looks', 'sea', 'Even', 'theme', 'simple', 'story', 'dependent', 'true', 'selfless', 'love', 'how', 'boundaries', 'age', 'experience', 'even', 'species', 'Not', 'mention', 'parents', 'letting', 'go', 'children.If', 'downside', 'story', 'lack', 'internal', 'conflict', 'Example', 'test', 'Fujimoto', 'sea', 'goddess', 'use', 'Sosuke', 'well', 'far', 'less', 'impressive', 'seems.And', 'Miyazaki', 'not', 'disappoint', 'animationwise', 'waterworld', 'luminous', 'sea', 'life', 'sparkling', 'ships', 'prehistoric', 'creatures', 'finned', 'submarines', 'town', 'been', 'swallowed', 'sea', 'complete', 'boats', 'floating', 'rooftops', 'exquisite', 'piece', 'work', 'ocean', 'magical', 'otherworldly', 'where', 'wizards', 'work', 'coral-encrusted', 'towers', 'shimmering', 'jellyfish', 'take', 'little', 'mermaids', 'surface.Ponyo', 'lot', 'movie', 'charm', 'effusive', 'hyperactive', 'babylike', 'fascination', 'human', 'world', 'HAM', 'array', 'handy', 'magical', 'powers', 'Sosuke', 'likable', 'lad', 'who', 'fascinated', 'Ponyo', 'world', 'Fujimoto', 'enjoyable', 'anti-hero', 'spindly', 'gaunt', 'mane', 'messy', 'red', 'hair', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'embodiment', 'parental', 'stress.As', 'particular', 'edition', 'plushie', 'fish', 'Ponyo', 'very', 'cute', 'fuzzy', 'appropriate', 'addition', 'DVD', 'more', 'childlike', 'why', 'not', 'include', 'toy', 'Ponyo', 'simpler', 'more', 'childlike', 'fare', 'most', 'Miyazaki', 'past', 'films', 'still', 'sweet', 'lushly-animated', 'piece', 'work', 'very', 'least', 'will', 'transport', 'magical', 'childhood']",N/A
1314576,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B002ZTQVBQ,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","It's wonderful to live in an era when one of the all time legends of entertainment is still actively producing works. I imagine that in years to come people will look back with tremendous fondness to the days when Hayao Miyazaki was still directing and it's a blessing to know (or at least hope) that more films are yet to come. I had heard after `Howl's Moving Castle' that Miyazaki might be retiring from directing but Ponyo laid that rumor to rest. According to Wikipedia Miyazaki is signed to direct at least two more movies but at 69 years of age you never know.Ponyo is the story of a tiny mermaid who runs away from home only to end up in the bucket of a young boy who assumes she's a goldfish (despite her obviously humanlike face). Her father, Fujimoto, a human who now shuns humans and lives beneath the ocean tries to retrieve Ponyo using various water based magic at his disposal. Ponyo has other ideas in mind as she uses her own magic to try and become an actual human girl. Unfortunately all of this mucking around has created a rift in reality that threatens to bring complete disaster on everyone.If you've watched more than a few Miyazaki films you'll notice that like Walt Disney he has a particular artistic style that the animators at Studio Ghibli adhere to. The first thing I noticed about Ponyo was that the art seemed a somewhat different. It's a bit rougher or perhaps more simplistic, particularly with the characters of Ponyo and her father Fujimoto, than what I've seen in previous movies like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. The backgrounds by contrast are absolutely lush and gorgeous and retain the dreamlike quality that is a trademark of Miyazaki films. Most of the film takes place in charming little coastal city in Japan based on the actual city of Tomonoura. The rest is underwater and it is positively glorious. It absolutely teams with life and naturally this is all hand drawn animation. It's almost impossible these days to find animation that is 100% hand drawn but unless I am mistaken there is not a CGI frame to be seen in the film. I have to applaud the effort of the animators here in drawing some if the most dynamic, vibrant images ever.Miyazaki, like Pixar, has never produced a bad or even mediocre film only varying degrees of great. I felt that Howl's Moving Castle was below average on the Miyazaki scale and Ponyo is only somewhat better. My wife, on the other hand, felt that that Ponyo was every bit as good as Miyazaki's very best. For me the weakness was in the story which had a flaw or two. In particular it was hard to draw a distinction between what was supposed to be reality and what was supposed to be fantasy. Let me just say that the town in the movie undergoes a dramatic event, one which would generally be an utter disaster and yet here there seems to be no harm done. It's kind of like when Wily Coyote falls of a cliff and creates that ring of dust only to be up and around in the next scene. Miyazaki is generally pretty consistent in his stories and in this case it was hard to tell the boundaries.

I made the mistake of not checking if the Japanese track was in a lossless format. There was no information about this on this site. The scanned picture of the back cover isn't very good so it isn't easy to ascertain if the Japanese track was lossy of lossless. I went to [...] and noticed there that the Japanese track is, in fact, only the lossy Dolby Digital. Since amazon is now shipping my item I cannot cancel the order, but I want to warn other people about this. I am sure that the picture quality is great and being a great Miyazaki fan I am sure that the movie is equally great.Being a great Miyazaki fan I always listen to the original language track, NEVER the dubbed track. I did try and listen to the dubbed track of Kiki's Delivery Service at one time and it was horrid. Changing the music to fit the English language is truly dreadful. I have also discovered on other dubs of Japanese anime that quite often important plot points are distorted or directly incorrect. I have all the other Miyazaki films on DVD and I never listen to the dubbed track. Listening to the Japanese track has it's charms since everything about the movie and the way everything and everyone work to make movie great make sense when listening to the original track. That goes for everything, not just Miyazaki's movies or anime in general.So if you are a Japanese anime fan and are used to listening to the original track be aware that the Japanese track is in Dolby Digital and not DTS-HD Master Audio. Only the English dub is in DTS-HD Master Audio. I must also say that I am extremely disappointed that Disney made this gigantic mistake when making the Blu-ray.

Yes, it's for a younger age group, but kids are pretty sharp and I felt that the movie was dumbed down unnecessarily. The visuals are fantastic, but the story plods along, and after a while I was just waiting for it to be over. I never felt any connection to the characters and just plain didn't care what happened to them, which to me means the movie missed its mark. Also, some things happened that seemed totally nonsensical--for example, the mother drives with her son through flooding streets and a dangerous storm rather than follow the official's advice to evacuate. Why put your son in danger like that? Other things happened and I felt that there was no explanation given for them, leaving the story feeling choppy.

1314582,A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B002ZTQVBQ,Feelah the tigress,"[2, 2]","Ponyo is one of those films that needs to be viewed multiple times to get the full effect (just like many of Miyazaki's works).  When I first saw this in theaters my initial reaction was ""well, that was okay"", but now that I have the dvd and I've had the chance to watch it a few more times (and notice some of the more subtle details), I must say that it's growing on me.The plot basically involves a ""goldfish"" who leaves her home under the sea and is found by a five-year-old human boy named Souske.  He names her Ponyo, and they develop a friendship.  However, her father, Fujimoto, is a powerful wizard who attempts to get her back.  She later uses her magic to become a human girl, but her powers throw nature out of balance, causing a large storm.  Eventually, her father and her mother (a sea goddess) devise a test for Souske.  He passes and Ponyo is allowed to stay with him as a human.  And that is basically the plot in a nutshell.Like many other Miyazaki films, Ponyo is character-driven rather than plot-driven.  The plot itself is pretty simple, and the ending seems too easy compared to other hardships faced by characters in other Miyazaki films, but there is deep and rich characterization present.  I especially found the relationship of Souske's mother and father to be interesting, as well as the characterization of the grumpy old woman, Toki.  I find it interesting that she's the most cynical, and is also the only one to notice or care about the strange qualities of Ponyo.  Fujimoto is the closest thing to an antagonist that this film has, but like all of Miyazaki's antagonists, he is not one-dimensional.  Yes, he is a bitter, human-hating individual who is too controlling, but at the same time, he has some good qualities to him--he genuinely seems to love his daughter and care about her.  He even says at the end of the movie, as a sort of apology, ""try to remember me kindly, if you will"".At first I though this film was rather heavy-handed in it's environmentalist message, but then I realized that the only character in this movie who pushes the message is Fujimoto, and he is clearly bitter.  The sea goddess (the one who should rightly be most angry) doesn't seem that bitter or angry at all.  In fact, she seems to always keep a sense of good humor about her.  This is especially evident when Fujimoto is getting all stressed out on the boat and she just tells him to stop worrying so much.  In an act of good faith, she even restores some vitality to the seniors at the end of the movie.  In the end, everyone ends up happy and in good spirits.  Overall, I like how many characters are left morally ambiguous.  This is a hallmark of many Miyazaki films, and I love it because it really makes you think.I also like how Mizaki plays with some of our sensibilities by turning them upside down.  For example, he kind of plays with the mind of the viewer by swapping the parent-child dynamic between Souske and his mother, Lisa.  He often seems to be the responsible mature one and she often comes across as immature (but still fun and loving).  This is especially evident in how she drives like a maniac, leaves him alone during a storm, and in how she throws a tantrum when her husband has to work overtime and can't come home for dinner.  Souske's maturity is especially apparent during this latter scene when he has to tell his mother, ""I know dad doesn't always keep his promises, but he loves us and does his best for us"".  I also like how fantasy and reality are deftly blended together; as evidenced by how many of the adults seem not to notice or care about the fantastical elements (ex.-Toki sees Ponyo's ""human face"" and the other seniors aren't alarmed by it, Souske's mom rather quickly accepts the idea that the human Ponyo used to be a fish, etc.).  None of this is ever explained, and it's all meant to be taken in and accepted in a surreal sort of way.  Aside from all the interesting themes, characters, and whatnot, this is a genuinely funny and cute film.  There are many funny moments interspersed to keep things light-hearted.Lastly, this film is graphically and musically beautiful.  As everyone is aware by now, Ponyo is entirely hand-drawn, and while this may be a dying art, at least Ponyo is proof that it's going out with a bang!  I especially love the imagery of the ""living"" shapeshifting waves.  The music is also quite lovely; the opera singing during the introduction is rather beautiful, and Ponyo's theme song during the credits is funny and cute.  Disney has added a remixed version of the theme song in the later credits that I don't really care for, but you don't really have to listen to it anyway since it's in the end credits, so I guess it doesn't really matter.The last thing to discuss is the technical specifications of the release.  First off , I bought the blu-ray/dvd combo pack.  The thing you should know about this is that the special features are all located on the blu-ray, so if you only have a dvd player then you might want to get the 2-disc dvd set instead.  The combo pack, however, would make a good set for someone who's transitioning from dvd to blu-ray.  As for the special features themselves, they are pretty good.  Of note are some interviews with Miyazaki about his inspiration behind Ponyo, a section detailing the locations that inspired the setting of Ponyo, interviews with the voice cast, and a segment on composing music for this and other Miyazaki films.  In the past, Miyazaki films often had very little in the way of special features, so the Ponyo release is definitely worth getting if you enjoyed the movie.  So, there's my two cents.  If you haven't yet seen the movie, rent it first and see if you like it.

1314583,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B002ZTQVBQ,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[0, 0]","Be warned, the theme song of this fanciful epic by the renowned Hayao Miyazaki, who won an Best Animated Film Oscar for ""Spirited Away"" (reportedly, even the directors of ""Lilo and Stitch"" voted for that film even though their film was in the same competition.""Ponyo,"" a.k.a. ""Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea,"" is perhaps the most innocent and wondrous of Miyazaki's films. It's said to be loosely based on ""The Little Mermaid"" (even the DVD package suggest this) but it really only bears a passing resemblance to either the Andersen or Disney versions. Like other Miyazaki films, it tells its own story by its own rules and requires that you allow yourself ""into"" an almost alternate universe that coexists with a realistic world. Sorry to be so pithy, but it's hard to describe these films adequately. They need to be experienced.Big name stars perform the dubbed English version and most of them agreed because of their love for the director's previous work.Among these is Liam Neeson, who appears on camera on one of the bonus features on the two disc set. Tina Fey says she was channeling the movie moms she grew up with. We see the cherished Betty White in recording sessions (she plays one of three ladies in a nursing facility, the other two voiced by Lily Tomlin and Cloris Leachman). Especially remarkable are the performances of young Noah Cyrus (Miley's sister) and Frankie Jonas (the Jonas Brothers' little brother) as the two leads.

The story is about the love between two individuals who inhabit two very different worlds and how they cross the barrier to be with each other. The animation is as gorgeous as it usually is in Studio Ghibli films, and the story is quite enchanting.Ponyo is a goldfish who lives in the ocean, but wants to see more of what the ocean and the world have to offer. So one day she escapes from the watchful eye of her father and begins to explore the ocean, only to find herself swept away to land where she is rescued by a young boy named, S&#333;suke. Ponyo and S&#333;suke quickly grow attached to each other. However, Ponyo's father, fearing that she was kidnapped by the human boy, forcibly takes his daughter back. The father is not the villain of the story, but he is someone who has had bad experiences with human earlier in his life. He is naturally overprotective of his daughter. Poor S&#333;suke is desolate without Ponyo and Ponyo too feels saddened by the turn of events. But Ponyo is a plucky little goldfish, and having tasted a bit of human blood when she was on ground, transforms from goldfish to human and sets out to return to land and to S&#333;suke. The rest of the story swims along quite magically to a wonderful conclusion.Ponyo has been compared to My Neighbor Totoro, and I can see that. Unlike other Studio Ghibli films, there is no real environmental message here, though there is some mention of balance. The film is just an enjoyable, sweet story (and certainly far happier than the original Hans Christian Anderson telling of The Little Mermaid).",4,A Captivating Japanese Little Mermaid,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,1649,"['Studio', 'Ghibli', ""'Ponyo"", 'magical', 'story', 'inspired', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'story', 'love', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'inhabit', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'worlds', 'how', 'cross', 'barrier', 'be', 'other', 'animation', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'usually', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'story', 'quite', 'enchanting.Ponyo', 'goldfish', 'who', 'ocean', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'ocean', 'world', 'have', 'offer', 'one', 'day', 'watchful', 'eye', 'father', 'explore', 'ocean', 'only', 'find', 'swept', 'away', 'land', 'where', 'rescued', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'S', '333', 'suke', 'Ponyo', 'S', '333', 'suke', 'quickly', 'grow', 'attached', 'other', 'However', 'Ponyo', 'father', 'fearing', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'human', 'boy', 'forcibly', 'daughter', 'back', 'father', 'not', 'villain', 'story', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'bad', 'experiences', 'human', 'earlier', 'life', 'naturally', 'overprotective', 'daughter', 'Poor', 'S', '333', 'suke', 'desolate', 'Ponyo', 'Ponyo', 'too', 'feels', 'saddened', 'turn', 'events', 'Ponyo', 'plucky', 'little', 'goldfish', 'having', 'tasted', 'bit', 'human', 'blood', 'when', 'was', 'ground', 'transforms', 'goldfish', 'human', 'out', 'return', 'land', 'S', '333', 'suke', 'rest', 'story', 'quite', 'magically', 'wonderful', 'conclusion.Ponyo', 'been', 'compared', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'real', 'environmental', 'message', 'here', 'mention', 'balance', 'film', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'sweet', 'story', 'certainly', 'far', 'happier', 'original', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Anderson', 'telling', 'Little', 'Mermaid']",N/A

Alford,"[2, 2]","From Hiyao Miyazaki(who if you didn't know created the Oscar-winning Spirited Away)is this his latest movie which is an original story, although slightly inspired by The Little Mermaid and some elements of The Frog Prince. This is his eighth film that he's done through Studio Ghibli, which he co-founded, and was fortunate to be released in U.S. theatres through Disney.A 5-year old boy named Sosuke lives right on the ocean with his parents. His father is a fisherman who usually isn't at home, and his mother Lisa works at a senior citizens center. One day, Sosuke catches a strange looking goldfish he calls Ponyo which licks a cut on his finger and heals him. The fish gets away, but is really the daughter of a strange Willy Wonka-dressed man who is some kind of keeper of peace in the seas. Ponyo uses her magic to transform into a human girl, although sometimes she looses her composure which causes her to change into a slightly frog-like creature. She runs into Sosuke who immeadiately recognizes her as the fish he caught, and is taken in temporarily by Lisa during a huge typhoon which floods the entrie area. Lisa leaves to go look in on the old ladies at the center, leaving Sosuke and Ponyo to set out the next morning in a toy boat that Ponyo makes bigger with her magical powers. They then encounter Ponyo's father who takes them to his underwater refuge, where Lisa and all the old ladies from the center have been kept to save them from the flood. There, they encounter Ponyo's mother who is essentiually a cross between a goddess and Glinda the good witch, and lets them know that Ponyo can stay with Sosuke and his mother. The movie ends with the balance of nature being turned back to normal, because somehow Ponyo accidently caused it to happen with her magic.I'd have to say I very much enjoyed this movie. It's Miyazaki's first movie intended for children since My Neighbor Totoro, and it comes off as such. There isn't any dark overtone like some of his last films like Howl's Moving Castle or Princess Mononoke, and is done purely for sheer fun. Granted, the plot didn't seem to have too much of a main direction to it, but Miyazaki makes up for it with his stellar visuals. The dub is pretty fair with the usually roster of celebrities that Disney gets for its movies, including Tina Fey as Lisa, Matt Damon as Sosuke's father, and Cate Blanchett as Ponyo's mother. I'd say Liam Neeson was miscast as Ponyo's dad, and it could have done without the Jonas Bros. and Cyus siblings being cast as the main characters, but was still acceptable. I'd recommend this film as a mainstay for someone's family, although traditional anime fans might find it a little hokey.

Roberts ""The Mysterious Irresponsible Man""","[0, 2]","When I first heard of Disney dubbing Studio Ghibli's films for the U.S. market, I have to admit I approached them with trepidation.  I needn't have worried, they did a beautiful job with ""Princess Mononoke"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Spirited Away"" and the rest.  So when I picked up ""Ponyo"", I had heightened expectations.As usual, the voice acting was first rate.  Clearly everyone involved with the project cared about the product that would eventually find its way to the shelves of video stores across the nation.  Ponyo itself is a beautiful film for the family.  I saw it in Japan.  You could call it Hayao Miyazaki's twist on Hans Christina Andersen's ""The Little Mermaid"", but that would be a disservice to the innate storytelling ability of Hayao Miyazaki.  There's far more here than a western tale told in Japanese style.  This is a story told with heart, al all to rare thing nowadays.BUTThere was one thing I objected to, enough to take a star away from what would otherwise have been a perfect review.  The film ended with a despicable re-mix of the ""Ponyo"" theme, featuring (gag) AUTO-TUNE.  Oh, the pain... the pain...So, I loved the film.  But the soundtrack will not be on my shelf.

When my children were much younger, I had purchased Totoro for them and we all enjoyed that film for years as a family...and we still do. Naussica, Castle In The Sky, Spirited Away, and his entire body of work is breathtaking in their own right. However, for my money, I'd have to say Ponyo is his most visually stunning film. The colors are a feast for the eyes (moreso on blu ray) and while this may be yet another reimagining of &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34; story, it is an incredibly sweet and charming tale.My children are now young adults and even though they show little to no interest in the Disney fare of their youth, they still love the Miyazaki films...and with good reason. Somehow, Miyazaki is able to tap into that dearest of human traits we all long for...the wide eyed wonder of innocence. He does so without sugar coating his material, nor does he speak down to his audience. He doesn't rely on juvenile humor or overtly sappy sentimentality.This film, in particular, is a prime example of this talent. Even as an adult, when you first hear Ponyo declare &#34;Ponyo loves Sosuke!&#34;, it warms the heart because it comes off not only as incredibly sweet, but totally sincere. The English voice cast is well matched, but I must say I was most impressed by Tina (SNL, 30 Rock) Fey's portrayal of Lisa, Sosuke's somewhat frenetic mother. Fey doesn't have one of those voices that sticks out in your head, as is most common in animated fare. Hers is a simple and earnest voice which delivers lines with complete believability. Liam Neeson and Cate Blanchette are also quite charming in their roles, as are Betty White, Cloris Leachman, and Lily Tomlin.Ponyo is a delight from start to finish and it makes me long for more traditional hand drawn animation.

This is my first ever unfavorable opinion of a Miyazaki film, and it saddens me greatly that I did not enjoy it.  But I honestly did not enjoy ""Ponyo"".  The artwork and animation are both great, so I give it 2 stars for that.  But...I didn't like any of the characters very much.  Miyazaki's usually rich character development seems missing here.  Maybe this _was_ meant for 5-year olds, I dunno, but I just couldn't make much sense of hardly anything in the movie.  It jumped around from one place to the other and I just couldn't come to care about any of the characters very much.  The slight plot didn't do a whole lot for me, and I'm growing ever more tired of ""ecological messages"", especially when voiced by known Hollywood Liberals, and wrapped in dealings with Moon/Sea/Whatever gods/goddesses.I thought that Ponyo's father was just creepy, and his mumblings did little to explain anything, and at times just seemed forced to provide enough convenient narration to keep things moving.  So much of ""Ponyo"" just feels like it needs a lot more fleshing out.  Her mother was left just too much of a mystery for me as well.Sosuke's parents are likewise cyphers.  His mother's driving was insane, and his Dad is more or less a vapor on the sea.So much is just rushed along.  The fate of the world depends on the love of a young boy for a fish/girl/goddess???  Hrmmm...  So what happens to the moon & other disastrous things approaching, why do the old ladies feel better, what's going on...???I don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings or take a child's movie too seriously, I just want to express that though I consider myself a huge Miyazaki fan, I was disappointed with this one.  It's just nowhere near the level of ""Totoro"" or ""Spirited Away"" or ""Princess Mononoke"", to me.And I wondered if it was just too ""Japanese"" for me, so I asked a Japanese friend, who had told me before I watched it that she hadn't liked it, if I was just ""not getting"" it. She told me that she hadn't understood a lot of it either, didn't like the movie, and thought it was a big mess, so I don't think I have this opinion just because I'm a big dumb American.  But that's a sample size of only 2.Well, anyway, this is just my personal opinion of one movie by an otherwise superb director and animator.  I hope that others continue to enjoy ""Ponyo"", but I don't think it should be blindly accepted as terrific just because it's ""a Miyazaki"".

1314601,A3F9VH8916IA40,B002ZTQVBQ,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[1, 1]","Miyazaki has been a favorite of mine for many years. If there is one artist I can say has never let me down, it is Miyazaki (well, him and Tolkien, so you see how highly I regard his work). Every one of his movies are amazing, from his epic masterpieces Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, to his more down to earth family affairs such as Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro. So how does Ponyo stack up against the other films in Miyazaki's arsenal?Well, not as well as I was hoping, though far from bad.Ponyo is something different from Miyazaki, a kind of movie he hasn't really done since Kiki's Delivery Service. This is a movie aimed at children and children alone. It's a big change from Howls Moving Castle which, though enjoyable for kids, was aimed as much towards young adults as it was towards children. Ponyo is Miyazaki's take on the story in The Little Mermaid. A young goldfish, Ponyo, meets a boy named Soscay and decides against her father's wishes that she wants to be human. What follows is a dazzling display of color and artistry that puts to shame most children's movies made in America today. Let's face it, American animation is mostly garbage with no style, no vision, and no heart. If Ponyo is anything, it's a visually stunning work of art from a studio and director who don't mess around. Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki have been turning out amazing looking films for decades and Ponyo is simply the tip of the spear. Its visuals and creativity are outstanding in every way imaginable. It just leaves you lost in the moment in a way no other children's movies, with the exception of the better Pixar movies, can.More than anything else, though, Ponyo is a cute film. Ponyo's character design is just perfect to portray a little girl of her age, and with her level of naivety considering she IS a fish who just recently learned to be human. Soscay's interactions with his mother during the first half of the film (and her interactions with her husband) are so real and heartwarming I couldn't help the giant smile that crept onto my face. This is a heartwarming film.However there is a downside to this film. Miyazaki has always been one for incredible plots that, to the outside viewer, seem to make little sense. Trying to explain the plot of Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away to someone who's never seen those movies is next to impossible. But even those films had their right foot firmly planted in reality despite their fantasy settings. The people in those movies seemed like real people, and their problems like real problems. The plots, though fantastical, made perfect sense within the worlds they've created. Although it may seem like a trivial thing to point out in a children's movie, Ponyo to be blunt is just nonsensical. For instance Soscay's mother, Leslie show's an alarming lack of concern for her five year old son who she leaves at home during a flood so bad it leaves her entire home town under water. Not only does she leave him there, but not once did she seem to worry about his safety. Miyazaki is famous for his incredible portrayal of realistic strong, independent women in his movies, so it's a real shame that Leslie didn't a) have a bigger role in the film, or b) act all that realistic once the second act began. She's an extremely likeable and well-crafted character at the beginning of the film, but somewhere along the way it seems the writers forgot about her and just used whatever excuse they could to get Soscay and Ponyo alone together. Again, this may sound trivial considering it IS a children's movie, but again I would like to point out this isn't just ANY children's movie, it's a MIYAZAKI children's movie, and that normally means it's a family movie that everyone can enjoy. It also seems to me that the characters of Soscay and Ponyo could have been used better had they been a bit older. The plot centers around Soscay needing to love Ponyo in order to bring balance to the world (or something), but creating a love story like this around two five year olds just seems odd. Creating a love story between  two young adults, ala Castle in the Sky, would have been more credible and would have made the stakes more real.I just don't see many adults enjoying this film, or at least not enjoying it in the way they might enjoy Spirited Away or Castle in the Sky with their children. Don't let my negative tone fool you into thinking I didn't like Ponyo, by its own merits it's a good movie and certainly better than the trash most children's films are these days. Hence the positive rating. But I come to expect a bit more than just good from Miyazaki, which may not be fair I know, but when a director has such a consistent record of excellence, when I get merely good it's a bit of a letdown.So if you're going to see Ponyo, and your over the age of say sixteen, watch it with a kid. Any kid. I guarantee they will love it, and you'll get a kick out of watching them love it.Replay value; moderate.",4,"Colorful, magical, and completely nonsensical.",1362268800,"03 3,

1314603,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B002ZTQVBQ,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[1, 1]","It has been widely agreed that Hayao Miyazaki is a master at his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful story lines and similarly imaginative characters. His movies, from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA, and MONONOKE to the recent HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE are all not only gorgeously rendered in terms of art, but in terms of movie-making as well. Can this man do no wrong? Not really, but it is impossible to expect everyone of his movies to always be five star marvels. His newest film, PONYO, an unashamedly family-friendly tale of a ""goldfish out of water"", is as lushly animated and alive with interesting characters as you would expect... and yet this is the first film of his which treads into ""lesser"" territory. Don't get me wrong, PONYO is not a bad movie by any means. As mentioned, it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that the story doesn't stay afloat to satisfy anyone eager for another engrossing, in-depth plot.For its opening hour, PONYO is Miyazaki storytelling at its finest, in which a rowdy and overeager young goldfish (who later becomes named Ponyo) makes a forbidden trip to the human world where she is subsequently adopted by a boy her own age named Sosuke (modeled, interestingly, after the director's own son). This does not please Ponyo's father, a mysterious wizard named Fujimoto, who is very angry at the humans for their destruction of the sea (this environmentalist theme is not much different from Miyazaki's other films)... a problem he very much intends to rectify by creating jellyfish from the prow of his submarine. He separates the pair and tries to talk Ponyo into staying underwater with him. The goldfish, however, has already tasted both Sosuke's blood (healing a cut on his finger) AND some of the human food (ham, which she becomes inexplicably addicted to), and of course steals into her father's forbidden potions, transforming into a hyperactive young girl (who is the spitting image of Mei from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO). This triggers a dangerous tsunami which threatens to engulf the entire world with water. Conspiring with his wife, Gran Mamare, a diaphanous sea goddess who alternatingly shifts from super-sized titan to human-size form, Fujimoto decides to test the two youngsters' love for each other. They do this by elevating the sea to the level of Sosuke's house, prompting the youngsters to set out across their now ocean-infested world in an over-sized toy-boat (made possible by Ponyo's own magical powers).It is at this point where PONYO begins to run out of steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are adorable and the scenes involving them are funny and cute, they slow down the film. Where the film really takes on water, unfortunately, is at the climax in which Sosuke must prove his love to Ponyo, presented in a way which is strangely anticlimactic and rushed, bringing an otherwise charming tale to an abrupt halt. This will likely underwhelm viewers expecting another instant masterpiece from the man who has delivered far more interesting finales for many of his other movies. Remember the destruction of Laputa? Satsuki's search for little Mei? Kiki's rescue of Tombo? Porco Rosso's fight with Curtis? The rescue of the Forest Spirit's head? Or even the test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All those resolutions were far more satisfying and felt more complete than this one.On a technical level, PONYO cannot be faulted. The animation is absolutely gorgeous to look at, produced entirely without a single shot of computer-generated-imagery, and naturally Joe Hisaishi provides us with yet another breathtaking musical score; the best moments being the rousing sequences underwater, accompanied by a chorus and a soprano voice. And the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed as any other Ghibli movies.Having proved themselves worthy on translating and dubbing Ghibli's previous movies into English with top-quality results, Disney Studios and Pixar once again provide an English dub complete with a mostly capable cast of actors. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke, sounding very natural and believable throughout. Noah Cyrus as Ponyo, on the other hand, sometimes goes overboard in shouting her lines before eventually settling down toward the end. Leads aside, the rest of the cast includes Liam Neeson as the overprotective Fujimoto (who manages himself unsurprisingly well in the character), Cate Blanchett as Gran Mamare (in an omnipresent tone which is not much different from her Galadriel in LORD OF THE RINGS), Matt Damon as Sosuke's constantly seafaring father Koichi (who is good but nothing to write home about), and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of them, Fey is the best voice in the entire cast, imbuing the character with just the right amount of spirit and personality. Her scenes with Sosuke show real chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Leachman, who was spectacular as Dola in CASTLE IN THE SKY, is disappointingly wasted as one of three handicapped elderly women (she barely has ANY lines!), who are also voiced by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Of them, only Tomlin's character, a cantankerous woman named Toki, shows any real personality, but if I were casting the movie, I'd switch Tomlin with Leachman. Probably the only really jarring drawback of the dub is a blasty techno-remix of the film's catchy (but ridiculously repetitive) title song, which thankfully doesn't occur until midway through the closing credits.On the whole, PONYO is a good film; a fine piece of animated work which is perfect for youngsters and family audiences. Due to the loss of momentum toward the end, though, it falls far short of classic status. Since Miyazaki at his least is still better than a majority of other animated films, though, I'll be generous and give PONYO a full star recommendation, because any feature of his is still very much worth watching.  And of course, Disney gives it a superlative DVD edition complete with an impeccable visual and sound transfer as well as a huge serving of extras--arguably their largest ever for a Ghibli title.",5,Charming and cute but ultimately lesser effort from Miyazaki.

1314604,A2L4I94MZRYL4M,B002ZTQVBQ,Joshua C. Steffey,"[0, 4]","I, among many other people, love Miyazaki's work. In fact I own some of his films. Ponyo, however, is another story. Back in 2007 when I heard on imdb.com and saw a trailer on youtube.com that Miyazaki was in the project of another anime film I thought ""Awesome! Can't wait to see"". Seeing the Japanese trailer I thought ""Cute. Chibi-like anime (I like). Japanese actors seemed great. When's it coming to America?""It's been about two years later when John Lasseter (PIXAR/Toy Story) among with other producers and other workers from Disney became affectionately involved in this film when somebody realizes, ""Hey, you know what? This story is very similar to our Little Mermaid.""That's when the American/English actors/actresses were in the project voicing these characters. I honestly believe that the American producers, or whoever is in charge of choosing actors, could have done a better job picking the right actors for these characters, but they feel like since Hannah Montana and The Jonas Brothers came along the same year Ponyo did somebody thought lets get the youngest sister of Hannah Montana and the youngest brother from the Jonas Brothers to be in this film and make a song for the ending credits. How cute.Something tells me that the American producers/agents were on a extreme tight schedule so they thought ""Cool lets get these two youngsters as the stars - easy money"". As for the other actors - I don't want to say they did awful 'cause then I be an idiot, but I must say that some (NOT ALL, but some) could've done better. I mean some of the American actors were just sticking out like a sore thumb. It's noticeable and sometimes it can be an eye sore. I mean compared to Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle they actually, in my opinion, had actors Americans knew which one was best for each role. Heck, I never would have thought Billy Bob Thornton and Jada Pinkett Smith would be in an anime, but I think they did well.Story - like I mentioned, Ponyo is like Miyazaki's version of The Little Mermaid. Is this good or bad? I'll explain - Like the story it begins under the sea (lol), but instead of a castle it starts with what looks like a boat with fins. Ironically the father of Ponyo, Fujimoto, hates humans, yet he's driving a boat that can submerge and float. How hypocritical. So escaping, Ponyo encounters a five-year-old boy named Sosuke and the two of them become the start of the story. Their friendship leads the townspeople in jeopardy when the town experiences heavy rainstorms, tsunamis, and floods, so the two of them must journey on a small boat Ponyo magically bloated from Sosuke's toy boat. They search to find Sosuke's mother (Lisa), who watches the local senior citizens. So far so good. They finally find land and walk when they find Lisa's car leaving Sosoke helpless, which cuts to the next scene. At the bottom of the new sea (Thanks to the flood) the local senior citizens are fine and walking like their young again. Lisa talks to Ponyo's mother, which I'm assuming tells her everything what's going on. So Fujimoto arrives to tell Sosuke that everything's going to be alright and leads to the finale of the story where Ponyo and her mother agree that she wants to stay with Sosuke. Finally the ending settles with Ponyo, as a fish, bounces in the air and lands perfectly safe on Soskue's lips, giving a kiss at the ending. So I'm suppose to assume that these two are destined to be in love for the rest of their lives.All I can say is that overall this movie is half-and-half (Good and bad). It's like the first half of the film had a great star, encounter, and chemistry with the characters and with story, but all of that kind of backfires the audience leaving them with questions about most things occurring in the story. I think what bothers me the most are the American producers who felt like to me that they did it quick just to get it over with to get on with their other projects. Some of the American actors weren't so great. In fact why would there be pre-teen actors portraying a five-year-old boy and girl. That's what gets me. The musical score by Joe Hisaishi was fantastic. I love nearly all of his work. The animation was also great. Similar animation styles from his early works like My Neighbor Totoro. Finally the ending of the story felt awkward and not entirely fulfilling. I hope I haven't upset any anime fans or anybody else. I'm just speaking what I felt about this movie. Again I love Miyazaki, but this movie wasn't that great.",3,"Miyazaki's ""Under the Sea""",1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,4529,"['many', 'other', 'people', 'love', 'Miyazaki', 'work', 'fact', 'own', 'films', 'Ponyo', 'however', 'story', 'Back', '2007', 'when', 'heard', 'imdb.com', 'saw', 'trailer', 'youtube.com', 'Miyazaki', 'was', 'project', 'anime', 'film', 'thought', 'Awesome', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Seeing', 'Japanese', 'trailer', 'thought', 'Cute', 'Chibi-like', 'anime', 'like', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'seemed', 'great', 'When', 'coming', 'America', 'been', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'PIXAR/Toy', 'Story', 'other', 'producers', 'other', 'workers', 'Disney', 'became', 'affectionately', 'involved', 'film', 'when', 'somebody', 'Hey', 'know', 'what', 'story', 'very', 'similar', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'when', 'American/English', 'actors/actresses', 'were', 'project', 'voicing', 'characters', 'honestly', 'believe', 'American', 'producers', 'whoever', 'charge', 'choosing', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'picking', 'right', 'actors', 'characters', 'feel', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'Jonas', 'Brothers', 'came', 'along', 'same', 'year', 'Ponyo', 'did', 'somebody', 'thought', 'get', 'youngest', 'sister', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'youngest', 'brother', 'Jonas', 'Brothers', 'be', 'film', 'make', 'song', 'ending', 'credits', 'How', 'cute.Something', 'tells', 'American', 'producers/agents', 'were', 'extreme', 'tight', 'schedule', 'thought', 'Cool', 'get', 'two', 'youngsters', 'stars', 'easy', 'money', 'other', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'did', 'awful', 'then', 'be', 'idiot', 'must', 'say', 'NOT', 'ALL', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'mean', 'American', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'sticking', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'noticeable', 'can', 'be', 'eye', 'sore', 'mean', 'compared', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'actually', 'opinion', 'had', 'actors', 'Americans', 'knew', 'one', 'was', 'best', 'role', 'Heck', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'would', 'be', 'anime', 'think', 'did', 'well.Story', 'mentioned', 'Ponyo', 'Miyazaki', 'version', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'good', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'story', 'sea', 'lol', 'instead', 'castle', 'what', 'boat', 'fins', 'Ironically', 'father', 'Ponyo', 'Fujimoto', 'humans', 'driving', 'boat', 'can', 'submerge', 'float', 'How', 'hypocritical', 'So', 'escaping', 'Ponyo', 'five-year-old', 'boy', 'named', 'Sosuke', 'two', 'become', 'start', 'story', 'friendship', 'townspeople', 'jeopardy', 'when', 'town', 'experiences', 'heavy', 'rainstorms', 'tsunamis', 'floods', 'two', 'must', 'journey', 'small', 'boat', 'Ponyo', 'magically', 'bloated', 'Sosuke', 'toy', 'boat', 'search', 'find', 'Sosuke', 'mother', 'Lisa', 'who', 'local', 'senior', 'citizens', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'finally', 'find', 'land', 'walk', 'when', 'find', 'Lisa', 'car', 'leaving', 'Sosoke', 'helpless', 'next', 'scene', 'bottom', 'new', 'sea', 'Thanks', 'flood', 'local', 'senior', 'citizens', 'are', 'fine', 'walking', 'young', 'again', 'Lisa', 'talks', 'Ponyo', 'mother', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'tells', 'everything', 'what', 'going', 'So', 'Fujimoto', 'tell', 'Sosuke', 'everything', 'going', 'be', 'alright', 'finale', 'story', 'where', 'Ponyo', 'mother', 'agree', 'stay', 'Sosuke', 'Finally', 'ending', 'settles', 'Ponyo', 'fish', 'bounces', 'air', 'perfectly', 'safe', 'Soskue', 'lips', 'giving', 'kiss', 'ending', ""'m"", 'suppose', 'assume', 'two', 'are', 'destined', 'be', 'love', 'rest', 'lives.All', 'can', 'say', 'overall', 'movie', 'half-and-half', 'Good', 'bad', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'star', 'encounter', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'story', 'kind', 'backfires', 'audience', 'leaving', 'questions', 'most', 'things', 'occurring', 'story', 'think', 'what', 'most', 'are', 'American', 'producers', 'who', 'felt', 'did', 'quick', 'just', 'get', 'over', 'get', 'other', 'projects', 'American', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'great', 'fact', 'why', 'would', 'there', 'be', 'pre-teen', 'actors', 'portraying', 'five-year-old', 'boy', 'girl', 'what', 'musical', 'score', 'Joe', 'Hisaishi', 'was', 'fantastic', 'love', 'nearly', 'work', 'animation', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'Similar', 'animation', 'styles', 'early', 'works', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'Finally', 'ending', 'story', 'felt', 'awkward', 'not', 'entirely', 'fulfilling', 'hope', 'have', ""n't"", 'upset', 'anime', 'fans', 'anybody', 'else', ""'m"", 'just', 'speaking', 'what', 'felt', 'movie', 'Again', 'love', 'Miyazaki', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'great']",N/A

1314610,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B002ZTQVBQ,K. Ostrowski,"[0, 4]","Every so often, I want to watch a movie that actually has some taste and quality behind it, and when I want that, who do I go to?  Well, Pixar, obviously.  But aside from Pixar, a second choice is Hiyao Miyazaki; a master filmmaker and storyteller from Japan.Now, before I say anything else, I feel I should say that I place Miyazaki second, not because he's not a good storyteller.  In many ways, I consider him a better storyteller than anyone else in the world today.  The drawback to his movies, which always impedes my ability to enjoy them is their subject matter.Miyazaki has a fascination with the strange and bizarre, which is no crime.  Disney does too, but where Disney focuses largely on the realm of fantasy, Miyazaki's films too often use the occult as their backbone.  Kiki's Delivery Service was about a witch, Castle in the Sky prominently featured magic crystals and spells, and most of his other films (Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, etc...) are steeped in eastern mysticism and bunk spirituality if you look at them too closely.  I consider them all entertaining, and in most cases, fun romps through a welcoming fantasy land, but I hesitate to show them to children, because of the mixed messages that this kind of world view sends.I only start out with this objection to get it out of the way, because this element is as deep in Ponyo as in any other Miyazaki film.  Magic potions of some type seem to drive the film's alpha plot, not only giving Ponyo and her father their powers to start with, but creating one of the biggest floods in history, and nearly destroying the world.  It's implied that Ponyo's father keeps these potions for constructive purposes, though, so it's not specifically ""bad guy magic,"" like with a character like Maleficent.  However, the worst thing is the character of Ponyo's mother.  She's a mighty, inhuman being who seems to embody and control the ocean, which I normally wouldn't have a problem with.  I'd just think she was a superhero.  However, midway through the film, she saves a bunch of ships from sinking with her powers, and sailors on those ships not only call her a ""goddess,"" but begin to visibly pray to her.  Needless to say, I won't be showing this film to kids without a major footnote or something.  We frown on paganism in my family.That having been said, as a movie, Ponyo is really quite lovely, if a bit misguided from time to time.  The background music is absolutely stunning; some of the best I've heard in any film for a long time, although the characters themselves don't sing; another typical staple of Miyazaki films.  The animation is very beautiful too, with a lot of gorgeous panoramas of harbors, undersea vistas and raging storms.The tale involves a little, red fish, mutated by a magic potion, who gradually grows more powerful, until she decides to escape from her father; the potion-making Fujimoto.  She washes up on shore, gets caught in an old jar, and is liberated by a boy named Sosuke, who she befriends.  Eventually, Ponyo is recaptured by her father, but decides to use her magic to metamorph into a human and escape.  She accidentally absorbs her father's strongest magic potion, causing a massive flood as a result, and going to find Sosuke.  However, Ponyo is still only a little girl, and doesn't understand all the damage she's doing, which is why Fujimoto tries to track her down after this.  Eventually, he meets with her mother (the water being I mentioned earlier,) and she offers to let Ponyo remain human, if Sosuke loves her enough.Ponyo and Sosuke need to navigate the flood she caused, but she gradually starts to lose her magic powers, and turn back into a fish.  Soon, Fujimoto shows up and takes them to meet Ponyo's mother, who says that Ponyo can remain human forever, but she has to give up her magic.  She also tells Sosuke the truth about Ponyo, and asks him if that's alright, and if he still loves her, even knowing that she's really a fish who turns into a person.  After they each make their choice, the film doesn't last much longer, but it's implied that things will eventually get back to normal.As a story, Ponyo is told much like Spirited Away; a lot of things happening at once, and hardly ever are real explanations given for them.  The audience needs to figure certain things out for themselves as the film progresses, and the potential for confusion is high, but in a way, all that does is change the tone of the film to less of a storytelling vehicle, and more of a piece of artwork.  Unlike Spirited Away, this film impressed me with its dazzling sights and beautiful music, and that's a strong word in its favor already; especially when the film specifically makes that it's point.Ponyo herself is an unusual character.  In a certain sense, she's shrill and often foolishly endangering people.  Bottomlessly selfish in her quest to get her way, and frankly, I don't find her all that cute, though she does sometimes like to help people when she thinks she can without sacrificing her dreams.  Thanks largely to that, I didn't find her a detriment to the movie either.  As a character, she's pretty basic and believable, and she brings out the best in her co-star Sosuke; a nice, responsible little boy who helps out his mother.Fujimoto left an impression on me too.  He's not menacing in any sense, in spite of his powers, and often, he even comes across as just foolish and inept.  However, he's also not really all that villainous, though he does express a desire to see ""the human race"" brought to heel at one point.  Aside from abducting his own daughter and imprisoning her in a bubble for being young and foolish, he doesn't really do anything bad, and his status as a bit of a bumbler makes him a sympathetic character as well, though it does mean that this movie lacks a real antagonist, unless you count Ponyo herself.My overall impression of this interplay of the characters within the setting of the story was more like an impressionist painting than a fairy tale.  Rather that being clear or direct with its plot points, or trying to tell you about what's actually going on in Ponyo's world, and what kind of adventure she's having, the film spends lots of time instead trying to be beautiful and inspire awe with its sound and visuals, and I certainly will not claim that's not a valid way to do things.  In a sense, I found it refreshing.When it comes to the messages that this film delivers, I admit that it was hard to find one that really stood out.  I've been told that environmentalism is present in this movie, but I just don't see it.  The environment is beautifully-rendered, but barely features into the plot itself; it's a film about magical creatures interacting with normal people.  I guess you could say that the message is something like ""don't mess around with magic potions.  Somebody always gets hurt.""However, in addition to this central message, there are also others; messages about family, about commitments made to the people you love, and how important it is to do our best to fulfill them, and to not torture ourselves when the option is taken out of our hands.  They're all subtly-delivered, but they're all there.  That having been said, I only have one more thing to bring up.Near the end, when Sosuke is approached by Ponyo's mother, she explains to him that Ponyo was a fish who turned into a human, and wanted to know if Sosuke still loved and accepted her, even knowing that.  Two questions are hidden here; does Sosuke like Ponyo as a person; and not just because of her magic?  Furthermore, can Sosuke continue to love Ponyo, even though she's not of the same race as him?  This subtle question about racism was very well-delivered in the Japanese subtitled version of this film, though I'm afraid the delivery was a bit less artfully done in the english dub.  You see, the phrase they used was ""accept you as you are,"" while in the Japanese, it was something like ""Love and accept Ponyo for what she truly is.""  I need to say that I prefer the more direct translation.  Why even bring this up?  Well...The problem is, America is a cultural warzone right now, and a lot of terms and expressions have been co-opted by one ideology or another to serve their nefarious ends.  At the moment, ""accept you as you are"" is a very loaded term, and has connotations in America which are just as negative as calling Ponyo a ""comrade.""  I only bring this up to be thorough, however, and because it slightly impeded my enjoyment of the film when I watched it in English.Lastly, I feel I would be remiss if I didn't mention the remix of the ending theme that was done by the english dub, which is in a very different music style, and is much more discordant than the original Japanese version (which is also included, if you want to watch it with subtitles.)  I didn't think it was a movie-destroying problem, but I know fans of the original would want me to at least bring it up.For all my complaining, though, my overall impressions of the film were very enjoyable and positive.  I can't give it a perfect grade, but it was a very good film, and when I have a couple hours to myself, with not much else to do, I may just decide to go swimming with Ponyo again.",4,"Overlook a Flaw

1314613,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B002ZTQVBQ,Lesley Aeschliman,"[2, 3]","Ponyo (which is also known as Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki.  For this film, Miyazaki chose to make a completely 2D film, and not utilize any 3D computer effects.  This approach gives Ponyo a very distinct feel when compared to some of the more recent films that have been produced by Studio Ghibli.  However, I believe that the simplicity of the animation really works well with the story being told in the film.  Ponyo is a very family-friendly film, and can be enjoyed by both younger and older viewers alike.There is one bonus feature on the first DVD, which is a roughly three-minute documentary titled, ""Disc Introduction - Meet Ponyo.""  This documentary features Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, who were involved with producing the English dub of the film.The second disc in the set has a set up menu as well, which allows you to choose between English and Japanese audio.  The features are split into two sections: ""Original Japanese Storyboards"" and ""The World of Ghibli.""  Just like on Disney's previous releases of Studio Ghibli films, the ""Original Japanese Storyboards"" is simply a version of the film with storyboards.The menu for ""The World of Ghibli"" is split into two sections: ""Behind the Studio"" and ""Other Ghibli Worlds Preview.""  It starts out with five documentaries, which run anywhere from 2-5 minutes, discussing various aspects of producing Ponyo (and some also briefly touch on some of Miyazaki's other works).  These subtitled documentaries feature either Hayao Miyazaki or Toshio Suzuki (the producer).  This is followed by a nine-and-a-half minute excerpt from a Japanese documentary about where Ponyo is set.  This is followed by a roughly eight-minute documentary about how Joe Hiashi scored some of Miyazaki's films.  Then, there are the original Japanese trailers (which are two trailers that run for three-and-a-half minutes).  The final feature in this menu is ""Behind the Microphone,"" a six-minute long documentary about recording the English dub of Ponyo.The ""Other Ghibli Worlds Preview"" has sections for My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, and Castle in the Sky.  Each one has a short documentary featuring Miyazaki.On this disc, there is also ""Enter the Lands.""  In the menu for this feature, there are elements from all of Studio Ghibli's films, but only elements for Ponyo, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, and Castle in the Sky can be selected.  For Ponyo, there is a character quiz.  For the other three films, you see a short promo, and then 3-4 page menus with clickable elements (characters give you character bios, and other items react when chosen).If you are a fan of Miyazaki, or you enjoy the films of Studio Ghibli, then you should see Ponyo.

I've seen it twice now and it still lacks the sense of wonder and mind-blowing awe of Kiki's Delivery Service, Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, or even My Nrighbor Totoro (all much better films).  It does not have the zing of Howl's Moving Castle, which was superior to this. Ponyo is a strange re-write of The Little Mermaid, it is yet another Miyazaki's environmental films. While it is enjoyable, it just didn't work for me. Some of the colors seem to be more muted, the characters more low key, and the magic not so magical. Even with the story of the balance of nature being out of whack, the Moon coming towards Earth, the waters flooding the land, what I wanted was more of the Mother Sea (Cate Blanchett) character and not so much of Ponyo (Noah Cyrus). A 5 year would be excited by this film, while I wasn't. I still love Castle in the Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Porco Rosso, but not this one. I watched all the extra features on the DVD and played with the interactive menus on the second disc, and I was very interested in what Miyazaki had to say and interested in where he got his ideas.

The artwork is amazing (as is typical of the company), the characters are entertaining, and even the acting is great (fortunately it seems these children inherited the acting talent from their families).

I've seen Mononoke, Totoro, Kiki, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle, and the animation of this one is beautiful especially with the sea-creatures and the animation that shows creatures coming from the water. One of my favorite scenes was Ponyo running on top of the ocean when the water had taken the shape of fish. Seriously, that was so cool.However, what bothered me about this movie was the vagueness of the story. If Ponyo's mom is a goddess and her father is human (or at least used to be) and is now a wizard, then why would Ponyo lose her magic as a human? And if Sosuke said that he would love and accept Ponyo, then she should have just stayed a fish. I wish that the relationship between Ponyo's mom and dad was explored more. What made Ponyo different from her sisters? To me, the story was just not put well together. I had no problem with the flooding of the ocean and some of the other parts, like the old ladies being able to walk again, but with the overall vagueness of Ponyo's background and her parent's, it was hard for me to enjoy the story. And while I can understand 5-year-olds becoming best friends, love is another matter. A 5-year old is not really qualified to make a decision as to whether she wanted to be human or not, especially at such a great cost. Ponyo/Brunhilde's father himself said she didn't understand (earlier in the story) Would you expect any five-year-old, even a bright one, to make such a serious and apparently permanent decision?Kudos for the animation and some wonderful scenes, but blah for certain plot points and inconsistencies in the story.",3,"lovely movie, but needed a more coherent storyline",1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,1712,"['had', 'rather', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'seeing', 'commercials', 'LOVED', 'Miyazaki', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mononoke', 'Totoro', 'Kiki', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'animation', 'one', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'sea-creatures', 'animation', 'creatures', 'coming', 'water', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'was', 'Ponyo', 'running', 'top', 'ocean', 'when', 'water', 'had', 'taken', 'shape', 'fish', 'Seriously', 'was', 'so', 'cool.However', 'what', 'bothered', 'movie', 'was', 'vagueness', 'story', 'Ponyo', 'mom', 'goddess', 'father', 'human', 'least', 'used', 'be', 'now', 'wizard', 'then', 'why', 'would', 'Ponyo', 'lose', 'magic', 'human', 'Sosuke', 'said', 'would', 'love', 'accept', 'Ponyo', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'stayed', 'fish', 'wish', 'relationship', 'Ponyo', 'mom', 'dad', 'was', 'explored', 'more', 'What', 'made', 'Ponyo', 'different', 'sisters', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'put', 'well', 'together', 'had', 'problem', 'flooding', 'ocean', 'other', 'parts', 'old', 'ladies', 'being', 'able', 'walk', 'again', 'overall', 'vagueness', 'Ponyo', 'background', 'parent', 'was', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'story', 'can', 'understand', '5-year-olds', 'becoming', 'best', 'friends', 'love', 'matter', '5-year', 'old', 'not', 'really', 'qualified', 'make', 'decision', 'wanted', 'be', 'human', 'not', 'especially', 'such', 'great', 'cost', 'Ponyo/Brunhilde', 'father', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'earlier', 'story', 'Would', 'expect', 'five-year-old', 'even', 'bright', 'one', 'make', 'such', 'serious', 'apparently', 'permanent', 'decision', 'Kudos', 'animation', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'blah', 'certain', 'plot', 'points', 'inconsistencies', 'story']",N/A

Sounds like the start of a bad B-movie of horror and bad special effects but it isn't.  Nope, this is Studio Ghibli.Brunhilde is renamed Ponyo by the little boy who saves her, and feeds her ham.  Ponyo falls in love with the boy and refuses to stay in the sea, to the point where she ends up re-starting a massive evolutionary boom within the sea.  She returns to land, bringing with her animals who have not been seen for millions, in some cases billions, of years.  She also ends up flooding the local island.  And makes the Moon start to slowly fall to Earth.  No, not joking.  Her father must now try to figure out how to restore the balance before things go totally out of control.  It turns out that Ponyo can live as a human and the world will be saved if she can pass a test.  If not she will turn into sea foam, which if I remember right can happen to mermaids in myth, and, I assume, the Moon will crash into the Earth and we all die.Ponyo loves Sosuke, the boy, the balance of nature is restored and everybody lives.Now, let me say I like this film but I don't love it.  I love Howl's Moving Castle and the other films by Studio Ghibli and I enjoyed this one also.

He's right to worry, since she, like every young undomesticated child, is an elemental force of nature who has little respect for the boundaries that grownups take so seriously.  She escapes and meets up with a young boy whose imagination at least is a match for her magical powers - and it is love at first sight.  Not romantic love but something more innocent and pure - like the youthful love of nature.It starts out strong - and contains some of Miyazaki's most delightful and exuberant imagery, as when Ponyo runs blissfully upon the backs of her sisters who are at once giant fish and enormous waves.  The story itself as it develops has gaps, moments that don't all add up, and unexplained elements.  As another reviewer mentioned, for example, the test that Fujimoto and the sea goddess devise for Sosuke is somewhat anticlimactic, unlike the tests faced by the heroine ofSpirited Away.  I had the suspicion several times that perhaps Disney cut things out for its U.S. release - since the plot lacked some of the depth and richness in its backstory of many of Miyazaki's other works.  A bit of searching shows I was wrong - this is the film Hayao Miyazaki intended.  He is quoted in the L.A. Daily News as saying: ""I intentionally tried to simplify things for this film. I figured that this movie should be seen by 5-year-olds, since they are the main characters. So I made the storytelling easy to understand. I figured they could watch it later as adults and understand the more complex parts of it, so I didn't foreground those elements.""  In hindsight he may be right -- from a young person's perspective what matters is just the magical relation between two young children, and from their perspective everything else, the fate of the cosmos, even, hinges on that.Like most of his films, there is an ecological message here, that humans tend to ignore the wonders around them and treat carelessly the gift of the earth.  Here it is expressed in an entertaining and magical story that will be easily understood by children.  While, from the perspective of an adult viewer, I found this film less fully satisfying than masterpieces likeSpirited AwayandPrincess Mononoke, or even the delicate and richMy Neighbor Totoro- which is the closest in spirit to this film - still it contains some remarkable and beautiful imagery and delightful moments.  Well worth watching, and a very lovely and simple introduction to the work of one of the most inventive and important animated storytellers alive.  There's no one else quite like him, and we're lucky to have another Miyazaki film, especially given his initial plans to retire upon completing the Academy Award-winningSpirited Away.

Many admirers claim ""it's hand-drawn, not the cold, heartless work of computers!"" or ""the symbolism is so important and you obviously don't get it,"" or ""Miyazaki's a master!"" or ""you need to attend to what's not being said as much as what IS being said."" I still say any film that has a father-figure dressed like a bad drag combo of Ann-Margaret and Cher, any film that has a mother ignore warnings and outrace a flood in her crappy car and then LEAVE her very young child alone (with a strange fish!) in said flood in order to check on a bunch of old folks who are in an institution miles away with other guardians, any film that allows 5-year-olds to determine their destinies in love, and any film that so clearly wimps out at its climax is hooey.  Enjoy the magic!  Revel in childhood innocence!  Accept the unacceptable!  Yep, heard and read it all before. Ponyo's annoying and endless repetition of ""Sosuke"" and ""ham"" is grating (not cute), and the ecological message is heavy-handed.  Miyazaki is more interested in emotions than conflict; yet, without conflict, emotional impact is lost.  Again, I'm supposed to believe that this boy and fish are drawn (pun intended) together?

The story follows a little fish-girl, Ponyo, that runs away from her father and wants to turn into a human and be with a little 5-year old boy, S'suke, that she meets.  The story ensues as Ponyo attempts to become human and threatens the environmental balance of the world.I had high expectations for this movie as I fell in love with Spirited Away and Miyazaki did not disappoint me.  I have never seen 2d animation that can compare to the quality in Miyazaki's movies.  Ponyo takes it to a completely new level with the style and scope of animation.  The detail of the water, colors, and fish is artistic and majestic to say the least.  Animation aside, the story and plot of this movie keep you enthralled and excited to see what happens next.  I think it's a good recommendation for an animated movie that draws you into the plot and characters so much that you forget it's animated.  Ponyo and he friend seem so alive that it was easy to become immersed in the story.The only portion to disappoint me in this movie was the last song during the ending credits.

He has ideas spewing out his fontanelle but it's rare that he can corral them all into a satisfying story arc.  In the past I've put this down to a culture clash.  But even that doesn't save this movie.  It feels like it was adapted from a book - a very long book which Miyazaki is just hitting the highlights of.  Who are these magical folk?  How and why?  Where?  If you feel like you need answers to these and many other questions, just keep moving.  Problem is, you can't just let the wonder of the animation flow over you because the closer to the end it gets, when everything should be coming to a crescendo, Miyazaki starts to stick in pointless static scenes.  If you're hoping for an ending that matches the frenzy of the middle, well, too bad.  There's some good animation of prehistoric Devonian fish swimming placidly - there's some elderly ladies who can run - that's about all I can do for you.Okay, M said it's a movie for the kids (I guess).  But this sells kids way short.  They can follow the arc of the little mermaid, why shouldn't they expect a compelling reason for the happenings here?  I imagine that anybody old enough to match subject and verb could summon up the confusion to ask why the moon was coming closer to earth.You get the feeling that there's going to be a grand ""test"" for the little boy - oh man, here it comes...  Then the movie's over.  Turns out &lt;SPOILER> the test is simply will five year old boy promise to love the little fish girl no matter what (which, BTW, he has done nothing-but for the whole stinking movie).  I mean, really...come on!  Did he just take marriage vows or...?  I hope Ponyo doesn't turn into a nag or little boy is going to have a 300 foot sea goddess with serious hair extensions out to open a can of whoop tuna on his little bohiney.  I guess being a goddess doesn't help you see that the whole thing is just a summer fling and they'll both meet cuter people in 1st grade.  Sad really.So I'm being harder than I should be on what was, for 2/3 of its length, a fairly magical movie with many wonderful moments.  But I'm tired of everybody giving Miyazaki a pass on story.  If George Lucas had put together such a confused narrative every Starlog website would be alight with raped childhoods.  Ironically, this is a movie that DEMANDS a prequel to explain how any of it actually happened.  Plus we'd get more of that hot 300 foot redhead sea goddess.P.S.

Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away, Whisper of the Heart are just some of my favorites.The problem I had is two-fold: 1) The animation was, IMO, sub-par. As another reviewer mentions Miyazaki aimed this movie at 5 year olds, well I'm not letting them have all the fun in what may be his last movie, so 1 ticket please! But I digress, Lisa's character (voiced by Tina Fey) was not well drawn, Look at her body symmetry, specifically her legs, as an example. I've seen art for children and frankly it can be done better or worse, depending on the illustrator. Since I've seen most, if not all his previous work, I guess I was expecting better. The attention to detail found in previous works was missing here. 2) The story was simple enough, again aimed at 5 year olds. But, in addition to being somewhat slow, it begs the question: What value did Sosuke's Dad bring to the story? He could have been left out completely as far as I can tell. Also, compared to Chihiro, I think Sosuke's test was simultaneously anti-climactic and daunting. In order to bring balance to the world's oceans a 5 year old is expected to love someone he has just met? I mean, a test of bravery would have been better, again IMO, to show his true character. I also think the audience might have responded to this a little better. Finally, such a star-studded cast. Wow, talk about wasting talent. I'm sure the fact that Miyazaki's films haven't done well in US theaters might be part of the motivation, and it did work, but unless you are good at picking out voices, most of the characters don't get enough voice time to matter much. Now granted, I didn't go to the movie to hear Cloris Leachman or Lily Tomlin, but I was expecting a little more screen time for Liam Neeson's Dad.I've been waiting for this movie to hit theaters for a year, and this might be the reason I'm being a little hard on the movie, but Miyazaki is not getting any younger and I'd like to think he plans on going out on a high note.I know that what I've done is probably equivalent to punching a kitten, and I'm likely to get roasted by my fellow reviewers, but this was not my intention, just my opinion, so spare me the righteous indignation please.

My children are 4 and 6 and they absolutely LOVED this movie. We saw it in the theater twice. As others have said, the animation is incredibly beautiful. The characters are unique, the story is imaginative and wondrous. Sure, maybe every detail is not explained, but this is a children's film -- children don't need every detail to be explained. The story moves along in a dreamlike way, much the same way that a child's imagination flows.As far as the film being scary, my four-year-old was a bit frightened of Ponyo's father at first. However, this movie is so tame compared to most children's movies today. My children were much more frightened by the baby who burst into flames in The Incredibles and the monsters who scare children in Monsters, Inc. than they were by Ponyo. I think it is partly because Ponyo is so surreal and dreamlike where many children's movies have an element of reality to them. There is no doubt in the viewer's mind that this film is make-believe -- perhaps this is why it did not scare my children as much as other Disney films.Anyway, I highly recommend this movie, particularly for children ages 4-7.

There is even a large focus on a senior center and the relationship between a small boy and the elders, all done with such emphasis on good manners and love.  Granted a fish does not turn into a little girl but that bit of magic is overpowered by the fabulous mothering skills of Souski's mother who just tucks that little girl into her love and caring of her son and grows her family.If you want a good film which teaches great values with so much ease, then this is a film you need to show your preschoolers.

However, if you're new to Miyazaki and just looking for a good film to watch with your child, you're likely to be blown away.On the one hand, Ponyo is far from Miyazaki's greatest work.  It lacks depth, dramatic tension, and even a comprehensible plot.  A lot of this simple but unique spin on The Little Mermaid simply doesn't make any sense.  Fortunately the stunning characters and their idealic rural/coastal Japanese setting keep you entertained enough so as not to really notice.  This is a beautiful, beautiful film about a sweet boy, a sweet half fish/half girl, and their incredibly sweet childhood love for each other that's more than platonic, less than romantic, and somehow truer than any other love in the world.  The fact that Ponyo's dad lives in an air bubble under the sea, yet must spray himself with water so as not to dry out on land, doesn't seem to matter as much in contrast.  It doesn't even matter so much that, at the end, we really have no idea how Saske loving Ponyo is going to stop the underground well from bringing the moon closer to the world in order to make the tides rise and destroy all of humanity, which her dad planned all along but now wants to stop for no apparent reason(??????).In the end, it was never the plot that really mattered, just the characters.  Ponyo is a charming film that reminds us how magical a world childhood can be, shows us how parents, the elderly, and even neighbors can play a positive role in such a world, and enthralls us in endearing animation all the while.  And, while the starr-studded vocal credits seem entirely unnecessary, they do an excellent job of conveying the voices of this world, particularly Noah Cyrus as Ponyo.Ponyo may lack the depth and epic magnitude of Miyazaki classics like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, but it more than makes up for it in beauty, innocence, and tear-inducing happiness.",5,"Charming, touching, brilliantly animated fluff",1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,2022,"[""'re"", 'already', 'familiar', 'films', 'Miyazaki', 'Ponyo', 'will', 'strike', 'being', 'lot', 'lighter', 'simple', 'feel', 'great', 'fluff', 'However', ""'re"", 'new', 'Miyazaki', 'just', 'looking', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'child', ""'re"", 'likely', 'be', 'blown', 'one', 'hand', 'Ponyo', 'far', 'Miyazaki', 'greatest', 'work', 'depth', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'even', 'comprehensible', 'plot', 'lot', 'simple', 'unique', 'spin', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'simply', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Fortunately', 'stunning', 'characters', 'idealic', 'rural/coastal', 'Japanese', 'setting', 'keep', 'entertained', 'enough', 'so', 'not', 'really', 'notice', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'film', 'sweet', 'boy', 'sweet', 'half', 'fish/half', 'girl', 'incredibly', 'sweet', 'childhood', 'love', 'other', 'more', 'platonic', 'less', 'romantic', 'somehow', 'truer', 'other', 'love', 'world', 'fact', 'Ponyo', 'dad', 'air', 'bubble', 'sea', 'yet', 'must', 'spray', 'water', 'so', 'not', 'dry', 'out', 'land', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'as', 'much', 'contrast', ""n't"", 'even', 'matter', 'so', 'much', 'end', 'really', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'Saske', 'loving', 'Ponyo', 'going', 'stop', 'underground', 'well', 'bringing', 'moon', 'closer', 'world', 'order', 'make', 'tides', 'rise', 'destroy', 'humanity', 'dad', 'planned', 'now', 'stop', 'apparent', 'reason', '.In', 'end', 'was', 'never', 'plot', 'really', 'mattered', 'just', 'characters', 'Ponyo', 'charming', 'film', 'how', 'magical', 'world', 'childhood', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'parents', 'elderly', 'even', 'neighbors', 'can', 'play', 'positive', 'role', 'world', 'endearing', 'animation', 'while', 'starr-studded', 'vocal', 'credits', 'seem', 'entirely', 'unnecessary', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'conveying', 'voices', 'world', 'particularly', 'Noah', 'Cyrus', 'Ponyo.Ponyo', 'may', 'lack', 'depth', 'epic', 'magnitude', 'Miyazaki', 'classics', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'more', 'up', 'beauty', 'innocence', 'tear-inducing', 'happiness']",N/A

A far cry from the neurosis of Disney characters where everyone is shouting and riding on high octane. Ponyo is almost completely silent in its first 10 or 15 minutes, and even when the dialoug begins it has more of a sobering effect. If you pair that with the gorgeous hand drawn characters and hand painted backgrounds you suddenly remember what animation felt like twenty-plus years ago.The story of Ponyo is truly Disney-esque on the surface - but only on the surface. A boy, Sosuke, finds a ""goldfish"" trapped in a jar and frees her. He also gives her the name Ponyo. It doesn't take very long for Ponyo to develop a pet-like affinity for Sosuke, leading her to the decision that she wants to be a human. It's really that simple. The rest is Miyazaki's masterful aptitude for making the plot less important than his signature slice-of life sequences of how people relate to each other and their environment. Watching Ponyo at times feels like people-watching. And, like people watching, it all amounts to a perplexing joy.It's strangely relaxing to watch his visually vibrant and animated characters bring color to such banalities as eating soup and ham. If you've watched Howl's Moving Castle and the delicious scene of Howl cooking bacon and eggs, then you've seen Miyazaki do this before. The man has an eye for the small details of life. This is not to say that the movie is not forward moving. There are some semblances of Western story telling. For instance, Ponyo's father who is not particularly fond of humans is constantly seeking out Ponyo to bring her back home. However, as dramatic as this may be, it's marginal to the rest of the story.

1314643,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B002ZTQVBQ,Spider Monkey,"[1, 2]","Knowing where to start with a review of `Ponyo' is a tricky one. It is a film with a great deal going for it, but with some minor flaws as well. This is loosely based on `The Little Mermaid' and like that film this is aimed towards kids. With this in mind it is less disappointing for those (like myself) who are fans of the more adult themed films from Ghibli, like `Spirited Away' and `Howls Moving Castle'.There is a slight departure in the animation style of previous Ghibli/Miyazaki films. This isn't quite so gritty or fantastical and it is more simplistic in general. If you are used to the lush renderings of films such as `Totoro' then the blank, bold colours will disappoint you. The style here is much simpler, with less brush strokes and artistic nuance; but once you get used to the animation style of this particular film you can quickly become engrossed in the fairytale.Like many modern Ghibli films there is all star vocal dubbing, with stars such as Liam Neeson and Cate Blanchett and these fit in reasonably well with the animation. There are also typical Miyazaki environmental themes, without them being rammed down our throats, and there is the occasional mention of man kinds pollution of the sea to ponder upon. The charm so prevalent in Ghibli characters is on show here as well and Ponyo reminds me of the kids in Totoro at times. Miyazaki's love of flying machines is also represented as well, although the main flying machine is a winged boat that `flies' under water.This has a simple storyline, which you would expect from a kids film, and the ending was mildly lack lustre, with a test for Sosuke that isn't especially taxing and for more adult viewers or parents watching this will feel slightly anti-climatic. But saying that and despite my earlier reservations about the animation, this is still a reasonable Ghibli film and taken in it's own right and considered as a kids film, this isn't too bad overall. I only hope the next offering from Miyazaki is aimed towards adults and returns to the lush animation of his roots. 3  - 4 stars.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",4,Ponyo,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,2140,"['Knowing', 'where', 'start', 'review', 'Ponyo', 'tricky', 'one', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'going', 'minor', 'flaws', 'as', 'well', 'loosely', 'based', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'film', 'aimed', 'towards', 'kids', 'mind', 'less', 'disappointing', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'more', 'adult', 'themed', 'films', 'Ghibli', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Howls', 'Moving', ""Castle'.There"", 'slight', 'departure', 'animation', 'style', 'previous', 'Ghibli/Miyazaki', 'films', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'gritty', 'fantastical', 'more', 'simplistic', 'general', 'are', 'used', 'lush', 'renderings', 'films', 'such', 'Totoro', 'then', 'blank', 'bold', 'colours', 'will', 'disappoint', 'style', 'here', 'much', 'simpler', 'less', 'brush', 'strokes', 'artistic', 'nuance', 'once', 'get', 'used', 'animation', 'style', 'particular', 'film', 'can', 'quickly', 'become', 'engrossed', 'fairytale.Like', 'many', 'modern', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'star', 'vocal', 'dubbing', 'stars', 'such', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'fit', 'reasonably', 'well', 'animation', 'are', 'also', 'typical', 'Miyazaki', 'environmental', 'themes', 'being', 'rammed', 'down', 'throats', 'occasional', 'mention', 'man', 'pollution', 'sea', 'ponder', 'upon', 'charm', 'so', 'prevalent', 'Ghibli', 'characters', 'show', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Ponyo', 'kids', 'Totoro', 'times', 'Miyazaki', 'love', 'flying', 'machines', 'also', 'represented', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'flying', 'machine', 'winged', 'boat', 'flies', 'water.This', 'simple', 'storyline', 'would', 'expect', 'kids', 'film', 'ending', 'was', 'mildly', 'lack', 'lustre', 'test', 'Sosuke', ""n't"", 'especially', 'taxing', 'more', 'adult', 'viewers', 'parents', 'watching', 'will', 'feel', 'slightly', 'anti-climatic', 'saying', 'earlier', 'reservations', 'animation', 'still', 'reasonable', 'Ghibli', 'film', 'taken', 'own', 'right', 'considered', 'kids', 'film', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'overall', 'only', 'hope', 'next', 'offering', 'Miyazaki', 'aimed', 'towards', 'adults', 'returns', 'lush', 'animation', 'roots', '3', '4', 'stars.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",N/A

O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","The latest Studio Ghibli masterpiece (would they even be capable of producing a bad movie?) is based on Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Little Mermaid"" but reworked into a new, distinctive take.  Under the sea is a once-human wizard, now a magical being, loyal to nature and indignant over man's treatment of the Earth.  He has hundreds of children, strange little fishes with faces, whose mother at first remains unseen (I'm trying not to spoil the surprises of later in the movie).  When one of these fish - an especially adventuresome little girl fish - is washed up on land and rescued by a little boy named Sosuke (who keeps her in a bucket of water and names her Ponyo), the two become inseperable.  Then little Ponyo becomes infused with human blood - after she licks a small cut on Sosuke's finger to heal it, and is changed.  She can become human, and yearns to stay on land with her beloved little friend, Sosuke.The little pair finds themselves at the center of a global crisis when the world, already out of balance, becomes much more so when the wizard's Water Of Life is accidentally unleashed upon the ocean.  To say too much more about the plot would be to rob the viewer of discovering how this wonder-filled story unfolds on their own.  It has hugely memorable characters, focuses deeply on the bonds between people - between Sosuke and Ponyo; between Ponyo and her parents and her numerous sibling fish; between Sosuke and his mother; between Sosuke, his mother, and the father who has to be away at sea for long periods of time; between Sosuke, his mother, and the old ladies at the senior center she works at; and so on.  It's full of whimsey, comedy, awe, and a pure, magically innocent little love story.  The animation and the use of color is fantastic, and the worlds and events represented in that animation are amazing - the undersea home of the wizard; walls of water being pulled skyward toward the moon; massive ocean waves transforming into huge, titanic-sized fish and back again.  The beautiful animation is complimented well by great voice acting.Studio Ghibli (makers ofWhisper of the Heart,Spirited Away,Kiki's Delivery Service: Special Edition - 2-Disc DVD, and a host of other gems), just continues to amaze.

1314645,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B002ZTQVBQ,Steven Aldersley,"[2, 3]","I am overwhelmed with emotion as I sit here contemplating what to write about Ponyo. That might sound silly, but it's true. Here is an animated film which focuses on two children who are about 5-years-old, but the story works for any adult who is open to being moved by its charming characters. To be precise, one of the children begins life as a fish, before undergoing a transformation.Director Hayao Miyazaki is some kind of magician. If you have ever seen My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, or Princess Mononoke, you'll know what to expect from Ponyo. It's closest in feel to Totoro because of the ages of the main characters. Miyazaki's animations look like watercolor paintings rather than the 3D worlds found in Pixar's releases, but although they are less real, they have more warmth and heart than the world's second-best animation studio. I don't say that lightly.If you're put off by the title, or the fact that the film was made in Japan, set aside those fears immediately. The Blu-ray comes with the original Japanese dub (although only in 5.1 Dolby Digital), and an HD dub from Disney for the US market featuring actors you mostly already know.Ponyo has a special place in my heart because it is the first Studio Ghibli title that I ever bought. I had borrowed one or two before from my local library, but this first glimpse of Miyazaki's work in HD is something I will never forget. The experience begins with five minutes of action without any dialog, and the colors, imagination, movement, and sheer beauty of the animation will take your breath away. If Kubrick had made an animated film, the first five minutes might look similar.After the initial sequence, we meet Sosuke (Frankie Jonas). He's a small boy who discovers something while he's playing by the beach; it turns out to be Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), who he mistakes for a goldfish. She's trapped in a discarded bottle, so he helps her break free. When he cuts his finger in the process, she licks the wound and heals him. Yes, Ponyo is a magical creature. The taste of human blood changes her nature. Sosuke takes care of her and keeps her in a bucket, but she is later returned to the ocean.Ponyo's undersea world is just as fascinating as the one above. Her father, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), is some kind of wizard who makes elixirs and helps keep nature in balance. He doesn't trust humans and fears for Ponyo's safety, so he's reluctant to allow her to leave her home. What he doesn't know is that Ponyo has come to love Sosuke, and wants to transform herself into a human girl so that she can be with him.The two most common complaints I have heard about the film are that it is intended for small children and the story is hard to follow. I have never had trouble following the plot, and I think it will work for anyone who doesn't dismiss it as being too childish without even seeing it. This is a film for parents as well as children.Miyazaki is an incredible study of human nature and knows exactly how to depict emotion in his drawings. I would say that it's almost impossible to watch without being moved in a positive way. Like Totoro, the story takes place in a world in which people care about each other. There are no villains of any kind. The story relies on events to drive it, and it's never boring. Notice how supportive Sosuke's mother (Tina Fey) is when he tells her that he's rescued a fish and that she has turned into a girl, or the respect that Sosuke has for his elders. There are a lot of good messages here for children (and adults).I want to mention two more scenes before I stop talking about the plot. The first is one of the purest expressions of joy I have ever witnessed in a film, and shows Ponyo running along on top of the waves as she tries to reach Sosuke. Look at the expression on her face. She only has one thought, and it's driven by love. The other scene shows Ponyo and Sosuke recovering indoors after being soaked in a storm. It's meaning might not be immediately apparent, but if you have ever been cold or wet, remember how good it felt to be warmed by a meal and a hot drink. Miyazaki includes these scenes because every human being can identify with such feelings. Instead of being bombarded by action and conflict, we are shown a world in which real things happen, and the scenes are stronger because of it.Ponyo is a magical story. It's hard to watch without breaking into a grin, and that feeling lasts for the duration of the film.

Nice just-under-the-water scenes, where the surface gloats suspended above us like a sun-glowing tent. The main villain/father figure looks like Alice Cooper, but he speaks Japanese, of course. The little five-year-old Sosuke is a sweet little boy, and he loves Ponyo, the little goldfish he finds. His mom, Misa, drives along mountainous roads such as you'd see in Amalfi in Italy quite a lot like Lupin did in the Castle of Cagliostro, or like the raiders to in Laputa, both Studio Ghibli films directed by Miyazaki Hayao, the director of this film. There are great scenes of wind and sea power, and our modern world is dwarfed by the spirit of nature (of course). The story get a little strange, when we learn that this little goldfish could set the entire balance of nature a-kilter, and cause the moon to collide with the earth (?!?!), but this is not all that important to the story, and it's more about the love between Sosuke and our little magickal childe, Ponyo. The scenes show Ponyo discovering ham, instant noodles, shortwave radio, power generators and honey tea. The film coughs up words like ""Devonian Sea"", which apparently is a geological period and system of the Paleozoic Era, spanning from 416-359 million years ago when the pectoral and pelvic fins of lobe-finned fish evolved into legs as they started to walk on land as tetrapods and had names like Cycloptopus and Devonychus. Go figure! One of the best parts of the story is an encounter with Ponyo's mother, a monstrous (and monstrously beautiful) sea spirit who is bliss personified.

1314649,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B002ZTQVBQ,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[10, 16]","The works of Hayao Miyazaki are always populated by unique characters and unbridled creativity in fantastically magical worlds. Ponyo is no different. However, where his other films like Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle play upon more adult themes and oftentimes truly terrifying villains, Ponyo remains very safely in the realm of whimsical childhood adventure, and sadly abandons the heavy adversity found in previous efforts. Still mildly entertaining, gorgeously picturesque, and wonderfully perceptive to the subtleties of childish innocence that evoke poignant humor, Ponyo clearly targets a very young audience.The son of a sailor, 5-year old Sosuke lives a quiet life on an oceanside cliff with his mother Lisa (Tina Fey). One fateful day, he finds a beautiful goldfish trapped in a bottle on the beach and upon rescuing her, names her Ponyo. But she is no ordinary goldfish. The daughter of a masterful wizard (Liam Neeson) and a sea goddess (Cate Blanchett), Ponyo uses her father's magic to transform herself into a young girl and quickly falls in love with Sosuke; but the use of such powerful sorcery causes a dangerous imbalance in the world. As the moon steadily draws nearer to the earth and Ponyo's father sends the ocean's mighty waves to find his daughter, the two children embark on an adventure of a lifetime to save the world and fulfill Ponyo's dreams of becoming human.Ponyo proves once again that it's very difficult to base a movie around a child main character. And considering the lead is five years old, legendary animation director Miyazaki must overcome an especially large obstacle. Unfortunately he is unable to infuse any reasoning into this imaginative but empty fantasy. Sosuke is given the largest challenge of his life and the formidable task of restoring balance to the universe when a hole in the fabric of reality is opened. Conveniently, he never actually has to deal with difficult trials, tests of his capability or proof of his love for Ponyo. Since he is only five years old, it would be a particular nuisance to demonstrate love as anything beyond a simple spoken phrase.The biggest problem with the film is the lack of any real conflict. Granted that it's targeting a notably young audience, but Ponyo plays out as little more than a series of events that progressively get weirder as Miyazaki starts to explore the supernatural and unusual fantasy - all without explanations or a basis in popular mythology. Never does believable danger creep into the picture, nor a frightening villain or emotional tribulations. It seems unnecessary to include a single skeptical character (Toki, voiced by Lily Tomlin) for a timid dose of realism, one who actually questions the phenomena taking place - and she's presented as a crotchety old wretch.At least the animation during the numerous underwater sequences is complex, creative and visually stunning. Apparently so much effort was contributed to these scenes that the human animation is startlingly simple and occasionally ugly. The best part of Ponyo is the music, movingly presiding over the grandest tsunami moments and causing milder segments to briefly become more stirring. Ultimately Ponyo is designed for the smallest of children - what it won't teach them is to avoid talking to elderly strangers with wild orange hair and candy-cane-striped suits who emerge from the sea.- The Massie Twins",3,Ponyo Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,3397,"['works', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'are', 'always', 'populated', 'unique', 'characters', 'unbridled', 'creativity', 'fantastically', 'magical', 'worlds', 'Ponyo', 'different', 'However', 'where', 'other', 'films', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'play', 'more', 'adult', 'themes', 'oftentimes', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'villains', 'Ponyo', 'very', 'safely', 'realm', 'whimsical', 'childhood', 'adventure', 'sadly', 'heavy', 'adversity', 'found', 'previous', 'efforts', 'Still', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'gorgeously', 'picturesque', 'wonderfully', 'perceptive', 'subtleties', 'childish', 'innocence', 'evoke', 'poignant', 'humor', 'Ponyo', 'clearly', 'very', 'young', 'son', 'sailor', '5-year', 'old', 'Sosuke', 'quiet', 'life', 'oceanside', 'cliff', 'mother', 'Lisa', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'One', 'fateful', 'day', 'beautiful', 'goldfish', 'trapped', 'bottle', 'beach', 'rescuing', 'Ponyo', 'ordinary', 'goldfish', 'daughter', 'masterful', 'wizard', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'sea', 'goddess', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Ponyo', 'father', 'magic', 'transform', 'young', 'girl', 'quickly', 'falls', 'love', 'Sosuke', 'use', 'such', 'powerful', 'sorcery', 'dangerous', 'imbalance', 'world', 'moon', 'steadily', 'nearer', 'earth', 'Ponyo', 'father', 'ocean', 'mighty', 'waves', 'find', 'daughter', 'two', 'children', 'embark', 'adventure', 'lifetime', 'save', 'world', 'fulfill', 'Ponyo', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'human.Ponyo', 'proves', 'once', 'again', 'very', 'difficult', 'base', 'movie', 'child', 'main', 'character', 'considering', 'lead', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'legendary', 'animation', 'director', 'Miyazaki', 'must', 'overcome', 'especially', 'large', 'obstacle', 'Unfortunately', 'unable', 'infuse', 'reasoning', 'imaginative', 'empty', 'fantasy', 'Sosuke', 'given', 'largest', 'challenge', 'life', 'formidable', 'task', 'restoring', 'balance', 'universe', 'when', 'hole', 'fabric', 'reality', 'opened', 'Conveniently', 'never', 'actually', 'deal', 'difficult', 'trials', 'tests', 'capability', 'proof', 'love', 'Ponyo', 'only', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'would', 'be', 'particular', 'nuisance', 'demonstrate', 'love', 'anything', 'simple', 'spoken', 'phrase.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'lack', 'real', 'conflict', 'Granted', 'targeting', 'notably', 'young', 'audience', 'Ponyo', 'out', 'as', 'little', 'more', 'series', 'events', 'progressively', 'get', 'weirder', 'Miyazaki', 'explore', 'supernatural', 'unusual', 'fantasy', 'explanations', 'basis', 'popular', 'mythology', 'Never', 'believable', 'danger', 'creep', 'picture', 'frightening', 'villain', 'emotional', 'tribulations', 'unnecessary', 'include', 'single', 'skeptical', 'character', 'Toki', 'voiced', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'timid', 'dose', 'realism', 'one', 'who', 'actually', 'questions', 'phenomena', 'taking', 'place', 'presented', 'crotchety', 'old', 'wretch.At', 'least', 'animation', 'numerous', 'underwater', 'sequences', 'complex', 'creative', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Apparently', 'so', 'much', 'effort', 'was', 'contributed', 'scenes', 'human', 'animation', 'startlingly', 'simple', 'occasionally', 'ugly', 'best', 'part', 'Ponyo', 'music', 'movingly', 'presiding', 'grandest', 'tsunami', 'moments', 'causing', 'milder', 'segments', 'briefly', 'become', 'more', 'stirring', 'Ultimately', 'Ponyo', 'designed', 'smallest', 'children', 'what', 'wo', ""n't"", 'teach', 'avoid', 'talking', 'elderly', 'strangers', 'wild', 'orange', 'hair', 'candy-cane-striped', 'suits', 'who', 'emerge', 'sea.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

With that he gives us 'Ponyo'.Loosly based on the classic film 'The Little Mermaid', Ponyo is a gold fish that knows there is more to a simple life than just staying under water in the care of her sorcerer father (who strangley enough it not fish like at all). With a little intuition she escapes to the surface and takes on a human form. The she finds a little boy names Sosuke, a boy who's favorite thing in the world is to help people. When he comes upon Ponyo he wants to care for her too and they form a very special bond. Now the two of them need to fight and let her father understand that the world of the sea and the world of the surface can live together in peace so long as both worlds understand just how important they are to one another.This film is such an enjoyable on, because of the fact that it has gone back to the magical roots that make Ghibli films so amazing. The scenes where the water looks like faces crashing onto the last is so creative and all the bright colors and the innocence of the characters make the film more enjoyable.

Fans will recognize elements from his earlier efforts, including his passion for biomorphic flying machines (flying through water this time, but still) and strong little girl in the leading role. It also presents something of an eco-fable, with seas rising as they threaten to do in our real, warming world. But, as in Miyazaki's previous films, even familiar elements combine to make a unique story.""Ponyo"" has been likened to Hans Christian Andersen's ""Little Mermaid,"" probably by people who remember only the disneyfied version of the story. Yes, the water-girl loves the boy of dry land. This story, however offers a lighter spirit and happier ending than the dour Nordic tale. It also blends in, perhaps, a scrap of ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" and possibly others. That hardly makes this a derivative work, however. The plot as a whole, along with the imagery that carries it, comes across as fresh despite its familiar elements.Although adults can enjoy Miyazaki's animations at many levels, he intends them for kids, too. This time, the target age appears to be five or so, the age of the boy (Sosuke) who costars in this feature. As such, the mood stays lighter than in some of Miyazaki's other films, and there's a big kid-power message as well. His light touch keeps the serious issues from becoming grim, though. This is an entertainment before anything else. Although not as striking asPrincess MononokeorSpirited Away, it certainly entertains.--wiredweird",4,"Enjoyable one, esp. for younger audience",1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,1568,"['Miyazaki', 'done', 'again', 'created', 'charming', 'engaginge', 'animation', 'one', 'spirit', 'own', 'Fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'elements', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'including', 'passion', 'biomorphic', 'flying', 'machines', 'flying', 'water', 'time', 'still', 'strong', 'little', 'girl', 'leading', 'role', 'also', 'something', 'eco-fable', 'seas', 'rising', 'threaten', 'do', 'real', 'warming', 'world', 'Miyazaki', 'previous', 'films', 'even', 'familiar', 'elements', 'combine', 'make', 'unique', 'story', 'Ponyo', 'been', 'likened', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'probably', 'people', 'who', 'remember', 'only', 'disneyfied', 'version', 'story', 'Yes', 'water-girl', 'boy', 'dry', 'land', 'story', 'however', 'lighter', 'spirit', 'happier', 'ending', 'dour', 'Nordic', 'tale', 'also', 'perhaps', 'scrap', 'Sorcerer', 'Apprentice', 'possibly', 'others', 'hardly', 'derivative', 'work', 'however', 'plot', 'whole', 'imagery', 'fresh', 'familiar', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Miyazaki', 'animations', 'many', 'levels', 'kids', 'too', 'time', 'target', 'age', 'be', 'five', 'so', 'age', 'boy', 'Sosuke', 'who', 'feature', 'such', 'mood', 'lighter', 'Miyazaki', 'other', 'films', 'big', 'kid-power', 'message', 'as', 'well', 'light', 'touch', 'serious', 'issues', 'becoming', 'grim', 'though', 'entertainment', 'anything', 'else', 'not', 'striking', 'asPrincess', 'MononokeorSpirited', 'Away', 'certainly', 'wiredweird']",N/A
1314658,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B002ZTQVBQ,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[5, 9]","Among my favorite anime films are Hayao Miyazaki`s ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"" (won Best Animated film); those two films are truly masterworks of animation accompanied by a very intricate storyline. ""Howl's Moving Castle"" was good but I thought it was a bit of a mixed bag. Miyazaki's eighth film for Japanese animation company ""Studio Ghibli"", ""PONYO On The Cliff"" (full title: Gake No Ue No Ponyo) has been imported by Disney to U.S. shores on a limited theatrical run. The way to approach any of Miyazaki's films is to temper your expectations; although honestly, hearing about another Miyazaki film is just so delightful that any Miyazaki fan would become excited. ""Ponyo"" is more a family-friendly film that uses the traditional hand drawn animation instead of CGI. This has been promoted as Miyazaki's last film.Sosuke (voiced by Doi Hiroki) is a young boy who lives with his young mom Lisa (voiced by Yamaguchi Tomoko) in a small house on a cliff that overlooks a small port in Japan (Based on Seto Island) One day, he encounters a magical sea sprite/goldfish that he found on the beach who he names ""Ponyo"". Taking the magical creature to wherever he goes, the two have such a good bonding because of a certain cured meat called ""ham'. But as soon as the two become close, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji) a former human who has rejected the surface world who has become a sea sorcerer who collects magical elixirs is hot on Ponyo's trail. He takes Ponyo back (who he calls Brunhilde) back to the depths, but Ponyo now desires to become human and to be with Sosuke; a desire so strong that she breaks out of Fujimoto's undersea lair that causes the his elixirs to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world that causes a major storm that threatens the island. Fujimoto seeks out the aid of Ponyo's mother, a water element dubbed as the Mother of the Sea (voiced by Yuki Amami) to try and put things back to normal before the sea engulfs the surface...Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, ""Ponyo"" is a film with a very simple premise that borrows some elements from ""The Little Mermaid"". As with Miyazaki's past films, the film has strong messages about ecology and environmentalism that focuses on the well-being of the world's oceans. The opening scene with all the pollution, debris and garbage in the ocean makes a very strong commentary, these sequences give justification as to why Fujimoto would leave the life of a surface dweller. Fujimoto has taken it upon himself to try to repair the damage this has caused, but all appears to be fruitless as the oceans are damaged faster than he could anticipate. Some of the environmental messages may appear too heavy-handed but Miyazaki is a master of fantasy-storytelling and he manages to overcome the film's flaws.The film's central focus falls on the friendship between Sosuke and Ponyo. Sosuke exhibits this optimistic innocence that is just so full of life. Ponyo as the sea sprite is just so cute and adorable.I admit to a certain extent, that the film does take its time getting to its goals. However, the first half is also full of charm, warmth and endearing scenes that would please any viewer of any age. Once Ponyo reverts to a human however, the film gets into gear as the viewer is treated to an animated visual marvel that is quite refreshing to see in these days dominated by CGI animation. Seeing a colorful, great visual achievement using traditional cell animation is so cool to look at, Miyazaki still proves that one doesn't need CGI to deliver a good animated film. Miyazaki has the eye to deliver something truly fantastic as well as bizarre and outrageous; Miyazaki intentionally made the drawings to resemble the use of crayons and pencils to make them superbly reflective of a child's imagination. The animation work is truly charming that retains the look of a kid's coloring book given life and motion. The animation work by Katsuma Kondo is excellent for the film's tone.Child actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do magnificent work as Ponyo and Sosuke. I will NOT give credit to the English voice cast by Disney at all, since I saw this in its original form. Anime is meant to be seen in Japanese, English dubbed work is often abysmal. Nara Yuria is magnificent as Ponyo. Her voice portrayal fits the infantile charm and wit exhibited by her animated counterpart. She sounds so cute and adorable on some scenes, it comes as no surprise that Doi Hiroki would fall for the magical sea sprite turned human. Tomoko Yamaguchi is also awesome as Sosuke's mom. Tomoko is a model and I could just feel her `vibe' as her youthful, energetic young woman. I was a little confused as to why Sosuke kept on referring to her as Lisa instead of mom, but perhaps this is just a reflection on the more modern Japanese family. Comedian Joji Tokoro is great as Fujimoto. His character is full of weird potential but sadly, Miyazaki doesn't really flesh his character out more thoroughly. I would have loved to see more of the relationships between Sosuke and his father as well as more of Fujimoto's background. Everything did feel like they had to take a back seat in favor of the visuals. I also would have liked more undersea world detail as rendered by Miyazaki.In this world, Ponyo represents the oceans and Sosuke represents the surface world. There are some parallels to the friendship between the two to the relationship between Fujimoto and the Mother of the Sea. Miyazaki seems to be giving the viewer that for the world to succeed, man and his environment need to work in unison. Man needs to respect and love his environment for what it is, and not change anything for his own selfish motives. Love, sincerity and compassion are needed to save the planet.Miyazaki Hayao's ""Ponyo"" is a little light in the dramatic areas and ends up better as an adventure `exploration' film than an actual undersea journey. It will not match ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"" in raw brilliance. The film does suffer a bit within the limits it imposed on itself, Miyazaki's talent still shines through and I hope that this isn`t his last film. Miyazaki has crafted another modern fairy tale that can be appreciated by the young and old alike. It is a timeless story of friendship, love and adventure that exhibit's an endearing warmth that cannot be soon forgotten.Highly Recommended!!

1314660,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B002ZTQVBQ,Zack Davisson,"[16, 19]","The mother Lisa has the most poignant line in ""Ponyo,"" saying the equivalent of ""When you find yourself surrounded by magic and wonder, you don't try and understand it you just enjoy it.""To me, that is the theme and lesson of ""Ponyo"" (""Gake no Ue no Ponyou"" or ""Ponyo on the Cliffs""). After dabbling in darker themes and more adult-orientated fare likePrincess MononokeandSpirited Away, Miyazaki has returned to the lighter, simpler themes of the magic and mystery of childhood as found in his groundbreakingMy Neighbor Totoro. One can always tell the target audience for a Miyazaki film by the age of the main character: ""Spirited Away"" was made for 10-year olds, ""Princess Mononoke"" was made for teenagers. The lead characters in ""Ponyo"" are 5 years old.Like ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Ponyo"" is a film based on a childlike sense of joy and imagination. There is no need for a ""villain"" or some arbitrary conflict or threat for the children to overcome. Like Satsuki and Mei, Sosuke and Ponyo are pure at heart, and open to exploring the wonders around them. They feel their emotions without cynicism or thought, instead living in the moment and experiencing its joys, sorrows and fears.Which is not to say there is no depth here. In ""Ponyo,"" Miyazaki has blended two unlikely sources; Richard Wagner's pounding operaDie WalkurefromDer Ring Des Nibelungenand Hans Christian Anderson's melancholy fairy taleThe Little Mermaid. The essential set-up comes from ""Die Walkure,"" where the god Wotan holds the goddess Freia captive, and is also the possessor of the Rhinegold Ring which grants vast magical powers so long as one gives up all possibility of love. As a nod to this, the name Ponyo is giving by her father is Br&uuml;nnhilde, one of the Valkyrie who feels the power of the Ring and must make the choice between love and paradise. This story is skillfully blended with Anderson's ""Little Mermaid,"" about a sea creature who must win the love of a human or be reduced to soulless sea foam.Miyazaki essentially presents two movies. The front film is basic, colorful and easy to understand for children. The animation in ""Ponyo"" is some of the best that I have ever seen, with Miyazaki personally drawing much of the underwater and ocean scenes, utilizing the influence of classic Japanese ukiyo-e pictures. Miyazaki has said that ""Ponyo"" is his most technically complicated film, using more unique images than any previous film.The second, deeper story is something that can only be assembled from fragments and snatches of conversation. For example, the wizard Fujimoto, Ponyo's father, was a human being who fell in love with the ocean goddess Gran Mammare, and struggled for centuries to burn away his humanity and become consort and protector for the entity he loved. More than anyone, he understands the sacrifices and struggles awaiting Ponyo when she loves someone not of her world. These story/sub-story elements are one of the things I love so much about Japanese film, where more expectations are put on the audience to read between the lines and to give thought to the unspoken as well as the spokenI am not sure how much of this deeper story survived the translation into English, as I watched the film in Japanese. There are some nuances that probably went missing, and I am curious as to how some of the scenes were handled, such as when Lisa sings Sosuke a part of the theme song to ""My Neighbor Totoro"" to cheer him up when his father is not home. Some other things, such as the significance of tunnels in Japanese folklore (considered the realm of female Mountain Gods who are prone to jealousy, it is assumed that the tunnel would not take kindly to a water deity passing through. However, outside the tunnel is a statue of Jizo, the protector of children, which sends a visual clue to the audience that Sosuke and Ponyo are going to be alright.) also might pass unnoticed or appear confusing to Western audiences, although every Japanese person would inately understand this without needing to be told.Miyazaki proved in ""Ponyo"" that he is still the greatest director of animated films alive.

1314661,A1F9CHXFQB5QUF,B002ZTQVBQ,Zerabp,"[6, 13]","I am a huge Anime fan. I love all of Miyazaki's works up until this film. I am qualifying the review with those statements because their are a lot of anime fans who dislike his work for various reasons and I am not one of them. As A Miyazaki fan this was movie was very disappointing to me. Normally there is a very strong story driving his amazing art that make it all fit together in a way that grasps you and pulls you in, with Ponyo this is not the case. The entire time I watched this film I found myself wondering if this was really a Miyazaki film. It looked like one and thanks again to the master Joe Hisashi but id didn't feel like one of his films. None of the characters were particularly likable or dislikable for that matter they were just simply there. The attempts at cuteness wroked for about the first 20 minutes after that it just took time away from what could have been used for a better story or more characters development. The only reason this is a two star review as opposed to one is because of the great soundtrack and amazing visuals. All in all the movie while nice to look at for a short period of time ended up being just plain boring with a weak story and even weaker characters and character development. If you must see this movie please rent it first, if you like it more power to you. I would not suggest this as a buy though for fans of Miyazakei or Anime in general without watching to see if it fits your tastes first.",2,Not Miyazaki's Greatest Moment...,1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,1457,"['am', 'huge', 'Anime', 'fan', 'love', 'Miyazaki', 'up', 'film', 'am', 'qualifying', 'review', 'statements', 'are', 'lot', 'anime', 'fans', 'who', 'dislike', 'work', 'various', 'reasons', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'Miyazaki', 'fan', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Normally', 'very', 'strong', 'story', 'driving', 'amazing', 'art', 'make', 'fit', 'together', 'way', 'grasps', 'pulls', 'Ponyo', 'not', 'case', 'entire', 'time', 'watched', 'film', 'found', 'wondering', 'was', 'really', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'looked', 'one', 'thanks', 'again', 'master', 'Joe', 'Hisashi', 'id', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'one', 'films', 'None', 'characters', 'were', 'particularly', 'likable', 'dislikable', 'matter', 'were', 'just', 'simply', 'there', 'attempts', 'cuteness', 'wroked', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'just', 'took', 'time', 'away', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'better', 'story', 'more', 'characters', 'development', 'only', 'reason', 'two', 'star', 'review', 'opposed', 'one', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'movie', 'nice', 'look', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'weak', 'story', 'even', 'weaker', 'characters', 'character', 'development', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'please', 'rent', 'first', 'like', 'more', 'power', 'would', 'not', 'suggest', 'buy', 'fans', 'Miyazakei', 'Anime', 'general', 'watching', 'see', 'tastes', 'first']",N/A
1314662,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002ZTQVBQ,Z Hayes,"[2, 3]","I am glad that I'm finally able to share Miyazaki's animated features (well, some of them at least) with my five-and-a-half year old daughter. She fell head-over-heels in love with Totoro, the adorable, giant forest spirit inMy Neighbor Totoro (Two-Disc Special Edition), and has requested repeated viewings since we first watched the movie together last week! I then introduced her toKiki's Delivery Service: Special Edition - 2-Disc DVDwhich proved to be another hit, and yesterday, we watched ""Ponyo"" for the first time.My daughter liked ""Ponyo"" though she was not as enraptured with it as she was with Totoro (she did not request a repeat viewing like she did with Totoro). The storyline is interesting enough, though it is reminiscent of The Little Mermaid. A little fish named Ponyo (looking a lot like a little girl) lives in her father's underwater kingdom with thousands of other fish siblings. A misadventure puts her in the path of a little boy named Sosuke, and the pair bond almost instantly. This close connection proves to be a key element in the plot as when Ponyo gets separated from her mortal boy, she does all she can to get back to him, causing imbalance in the two worlds in the process. The rest of the story focuses on what happens to the pair and how everything is resolved.I loved the colors and the fantastic imagery and animation. There is an abundance of vivid imagery and my young daughter was captivated by what was happening on screen. Ponyo as a character has a lot going for her - she is adorable and young children can easily relate to her precocious nature. The plot does get a tad confusing in parts if only because there is so much going on in the story, but in general, the story flows well. I still prefer ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" (note: this does center on a young ""witch"") over ""Ponyo"", but if you're looking for engaging children's animated features (ages 5 and up), you can't go wrong with these three. They are also the best bet for younger children in Miyazaki's range of animated features as some of the others can be rather dark for younger viewers.",4,"""Ponyo"" is enchanting and kid-friendly",1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,2123,"['am', 'glad', ""'m"", 'finally', 'able', 'share', 'Miyazaki', 'animated', 'features', 'well', 'least', 'five-and-a-half', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'fell', 'head-over-heels', 'love', 'Totoro', 'adorable', 'giant', 'forest', 'spirit', 'inMy', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'requested', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'together', 'last', 'week', 'then', 'introduced', 'toKiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'Special', 'Edition', '2-Disc', 'DVDwhich', 'proved', 'be', 'hit', 'yesterday', 'watched', 'Ponyo', 'first', 'time.My', 'daughter', 'liked', 'Ponyo', 'was', 'not', 'enraptured', 'was', 'Totoro', 'did', 'not', 'request', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'did', 'Totoro', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'enough', 'reminiscent', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'little', 'fish', 'named', 'Ponyo', 'looking', 'lot', 'little', 'girl', 'father', 'underwater', 'kingdom', 'thousands', 'other', 'fish', 'siblings', 'misadventure', 'path', 'little', 'boy', 'named', 'Sosuke', 'pair', 'bond', 'almost', 'instantly', 'close', 'connection', 'be', 'key', 'element', 'plot', 'when', 'Ponyo', 'separated', 'mortal', 'boy', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'causing', 'imbalance', 'two', 'worlds', 'process', 'rest', 'story', 'what', 'pair', 'how', 'everything', 'resolved.I', 'loved', 'colors', 'fantastic', 'imagery', 'animation', 'abundance', 'vivid', 'imagery', 'young', 'daughter', 'was', 'captivated', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'screen', 'Ponyo', 'character', 'lot', 'going', 'adorable', 'young', 'children', 'can', 'easily', 'relate', 'precocious', 'nature', 'plot', 'get', 'tad', 'confusing', 'parts', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'story', 'general', 'story', 'well', 'still', 'prefer', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'note', 'center', 'young', 'witch', 'Ponyo', ""'re"", 'looking', 'engaging', 'children', 'animated', 'features', 'ages', '5', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'three', 'are', 'also', 'best', 'bet', 'younger', 'children', 'Miyazaki', 'range', 'animated', 'features', 'others', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'dark', 'younger', 'viewers']",N/A
