1120986,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B000YW8RN6,C. Sawin,"[5, 5]","The Nines tells the story of Gary, Gavin, and Gabriel with each character given a specific segment in the film. The first segment tells the story of Gary, an actor who has more than a few issues. The second introduces us to Gavin as we're given a reality TV show look behind the scenes as he tries to get his show onto the air. The final segment is about Gabriel, a married man who designs video games. All of the segments are related and focus around the number 9. Discovering the truth about these characters and what they really are is what really makes the film worth watching.I had been wanting to see this for awhile and I finally got around to seeing it today. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be. I haven't seen a film tie together multiple segments like this in a long time. Everything comes together quite well and it's pretty satisfying once all the cards are put on the table. Ryan Reynolds proves once again that his acting is quite strong and has more to him than being the casual funny man. Melissa McCarthy is also worth mentioning. She starts off being kind of irritating, but turns out being incredibly charming once the credits roll. Hope Davis was the last piece of the puzzle and is crucial to the overall story. At first, she just seems like the typical jealous and conniving female character who didn't get what she wanted. As the film progresses, however, her role becomes more interesting and it's revealed how important she is in Gary/Gavin/Gabriel's path to discovering what's really going on.The Nines deserves a watch from anyone looking for something a little different. It'll definitely satisfy Ryan Reynolds fans and it'll probably meet or exceed what you expect from the film once it's all said and done. It surprised me quite a bit with a strong story, a great cast, and an incredibly solid script. Give it a watch.

1120991,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000YW8RN6,Grady Harp,"[54, 74]","THE NINES is a film that may seem like a tough story to follow, but the concept and the 'autobiographical' script by the gifted John August are so fine that once seen, this film demands re-visiting.  It is tremendously entertaining, blessed with a superb cast, and offers food for thought far beyond the running time of the film.  For this viewer it falls into the 'brilliant' category.More of an existential exercise than a traditional movie tale, THE NINES has the courage to challenge our concept of that is the real world, what is fantasy, what exists beyond our concept of our 'space' here on planet Earth, and just how significant is the current obsession with television reality shows and videogames on the way we are stuck in the present.  John August explores these issues by interweaving three stories, using the same actors to change vantages and personalities to raise questions and pose problems for the audience to attempt to resolve.  It works.Part I ('The Prisoner') views the life of a famous television personality Gary (Ryan Reynolds) who navely takes on a 'crack' trip that results in a house arrest controlled by a jovial officer Margaret (Melissa McCarthy) and whose only outlet is a neighbor Sarah (Hope Davis) with whom he has a seductive affinity: while both women appear real, events occur that make their existence questionable to the crack-addled Gary. In Part II, 'Reality Television', Gavin (Reynolds) is a television writer attempting to get his pilot film accepted by executive boss Susan (Davis), but falls into troubled times when he is told his best friend Melissa (McCarthy) must be dropped from the project. In Part III, 'Knowing', Gabriel (Reynolds) is a gentle videogame creator, happily married to Mary (McCarthy) with a daughter Noelle (Elle Fanning) who has been weaving in and out of the film as different characters, gets stuck in a forest and in attempting to seek help encounters Sierra (Davis), a strange woman who  finally approaches the possibilities of Gabriel's 'mission on earth'.  The title of the movie becomes apparent when Sierra informs Gabriel that while God is a 10, human beings are only 7s, koala bears are 8s because they control the environment, and Gabriel is a 9 - an extraterrestrial being in a human incarnation to test the goodness of the earth. How this information affects Gabriel and how the story is resolved is yet more of the intellectual exercise and joy of THE NINES.Ryan Reynolds is extraordinarily fine in his three roles: he is a far better actor than the usual films he makes would indicate.  Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy are as always reliably excellent.  But the magic of this film comes form the mind and direction of John August who thankfully gives the audience much to ponder.  It is a gem of a film.  Highly Recommended.

1120994,A12IR9EXKB8CAB,B000YW8RN6,"Leigh Pierce ""Writer of Wrongs""","[2, 4]","The Nines is a remarkable film by John August.  He is the genius who wrote the A.D.D./drug addled, raver cult classic Go and Tim Burton's beautiful love story, Big Fish. The movie stars Ryan Reynolds playing three separate, and sometimes overlapping, characters in the three short films that make up this one story.  He blows the top off this movie with his portrayal of a writer, a troubled actor, and a video game designer. This is one of the most original films that I have seen in a long time.  I would have to say that Reynolds has finally broke through as a serious actor and shed the stigma of being another National Lampoons' puppet.  After watching this movie, I had to wonder why he ever did such horrendous trash as Van Wilder. The movie is hard to follow but it pays off.

This is one of those metaphysical puzzler films, that is fun and engaging at a number of levels but at its deepest has you working out what it all means.  In films like this you think they are going to back down from the broadest ambitions, that it's all going to be a dream or a game and everything will work out so that you can go home happy, since it didn't really mean anything and didn't try to say anything.  Luckily, this film went further than that.  It takes its conceit all the way and leaves you hanging at the end -- asking big philosophical questions like: what does it mean to claim, like Leibniz (as parodied in Voltaire's Candide) that this is the best of all possible worlds?  The film feels like Borges for the youtube generation, and really goes as deep down the rabbit hole as some of the Argentine's best puzzlers.  It's hard to be a lot more specific without spoiling the film.The performances in the film, especially by the three leads (Ryan Reynolds, Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy) are uniformly excellent and surprisingly versatile.  There is nothing terribly unusual or interesting about the look of the film -- stylistically, the film feels a bit like television ... and this may be appropriate since one of the sequences of the film is about a director of a television pilot ... in fact this film feels like it could have been adapted for a television pilot, for a series I would definitely watch -- shades of Twin Peaks but grander in its metaphysical ambitions and humbler in its stylistic excesses.",4,An ambitious indie with lots of head-scratching fun -- smarts without smarmy,1202169600,"02 5, 2008",2008,1708,"['actor', 'bad', 'trip', 'bad', 'breakup', 'up', 'house', 'arrest', 'losing', 'mind', 'not', 'who', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'one', 'metaphysical', 'puzzler', 'films', 'fun', 'engaging', 'number', 'levels', 'deepest', 'working', 'out', 'what', 'films', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'back', 'down', 'broadest', 'ambitions', 'going', 'be', 'dream', 'game', 'everything', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'so', 'can', 'go', 'home', 'happy', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'mean', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'say', 'anything', 'Luckily', 'film', 'went', 'further', 'conceit', 'way', 'hanging', 'end', 'asking', 'big', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'what', 'mean', 'claim', 'Leibniz', 'parodied', 'Voltaire', 'Candide', 'best', 'possible', 'worlds', 'film', 'feels', 'Borges', 'youtube', 'generation', 'really', 'deep', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'Argentine', 'best', 'puzzlers', 'hard', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'specific', 'spoiling', 'film.The', 'performances', 'film', 'especially', 'three', 'leads', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'surprisingly', 'versatile', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'unusual', 'interesting', 'look', 'film', 'stylistically', 'film', 'bit', 'television', 'may', 'be', 'appropriate', 'one', 'sequences', 'film', 'director', 'television', 'pilot', 'fact', 'film', 'feels', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'adapted', 'television', 'pilot', 'series', 'would', 'definitely', 'watch', 'shades', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'grander', 'metaphysical', 'ambitions', 'humbler', 'stylistic', 'excesses']",The Nines

1121007,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000YW8RN6,Terry Mesnard,"[38, 40]","NOTE: Some of the reviews here (like the one below by Grady) spoil the movie by basically giving you a plot synopsis, including the epiphany towards the end.  Read some of the reviews here with caution.John August is someone who impressed me back in 1999 with a witty script for the zany ensemble piece entitled Go.  Directed by a up-and-coming director by the name of Doug Liman (Bourne Identity, Swingers), Go offered a straight-forward story that was constantly twisted due to a change of perspective as we saw the story from different characters.  The way it weaved in and out made the movie a lot more interesting that it probably should have been.Now, we have The Nines, not only written by John August but also directed by him, and it shares a few similarities with his big debut, Go.  However, it's infinitely more intriguing, intelligent and frustrating than Go could ever be.  The Nines is comprised of three short stories featuring Ryan Reynolds, Melissa McCarthy and Hope Davis playing different characters.The first film has Reynolds playing a blockbuster actor who is in house arrest, with McCarthy playing a publicist and Davis the next door neighbor.  As the scenario continues, Reynolds' character becomes convinced the house is haunted.  The second film has Reynolds as an effeminate TV screenwriter who is being followed around by a reality TV camera as they film his progress to make a pilot.  During this, McCarthy plays Reynolds' best friend while Davis is a TV exec.  The final scenario has Reynolds, a high profile video game designer, married to McCarthy.  Their car breaks down in a forest and when Reynolds goes to find help, discovers Davis.The way the film works is that each episode builds on each other, presenting a different perspective while also sharing common themes.  The way the puzzle pieces fit together and the epiphany towards the end of the film creates a startling new take on the film as a whole.  August does a terrific job of creating common themes and a central thread that goes between each episode and even when it's over and you still aren't quite sure what happened, you never feel cheated.It's a very heady film that's more intelligent than a lot of films that share similar themes.  While I can't reference the particular films without going into heavy spoiler territory, I will say that The Nines touches on religion, philosophy, technology, reality and how everything intersects.  It also seems intent on discussing life as a whole and the entire concept of creation and creators.  It's no coincidence that all of the scenarios are based on people living a certain kind of reality that is more ""reelity"" than ""reality.""The weight of the film rests on the shoulders of the terrific cast.  Reynolds, in particular, shows that he's more than Mr. Van Wilder and plays three starkly different characters with aplomb that belies his earlier roots in teen comedy.  This is by far his best role and it was amazing watching him in these three roles.  Meanwhile, The Nines also shares an actress with Go: Melissa McCarthy.  She steals the show and is a ray of light in every scene she's in.  Hope Davis is always enjoyable, and her characters play a very interesting role in the story as a whole, but, for me, McCarthy is tops.The Nines is a film you'll want to watch with people who you can have an intelligent conversation with.  It's a complicated film that, unlike so many today, doesn't provide you with all the answers.  Even when the resolution occurs, you won't have all the pieces in your hands.  Watching the included short film is as close as you'll come to an answer.  So, the best bet is to watch it with people who will want to talk about it, because The Nines is definitely a talking-about film.I'd definitely recommend it to fans of metaphysical puzzles and movies that don't provide easy answers.  An intelligent, thoughtful and entertaining film.",4,"A fun, metaphysical puzzler",1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,3910,"['NOTE', 'reviews', 'here', 'one', 'below', 'Grady', 'spoil', 'movie', 'basically', 'giving', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'including', 'epiphany', 'end', 'Read', 'reviews', 'here', 'caution.John', 'August', 'someone', 'who', 'impressed', 'back', '1999', 'witty', 'script', 'zany', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'entitled', 'Go', 'Directed', 'up-and-coming', 'director', 'name', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Swingers', 'Go', 'offered', 'straight-forward', 'story', 'was', 'constantly', 'twisted', 'due', 'change', 'perspective', 'saw', 'story', 'different', 'characters', 'way', 'weaved', 'made', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been.Now', 'have', 'Nines', 'not', 'only', 'written', 'John', 'August', 'also', 'directed', 'shares', 'few', 'similarities', 'big', 'debut', 'Go', 'However', 'infinitely', 'more', 'intriguing', 'intelligent', 'frustrating', 'Go', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'Nines', 'comprised', 'three', 'short', 'stories', 'featuring', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'playing', 'different', 'characters.The', 'first', 'film', 'Reynolds', 'playing', 'blockbuster', 'actor', 'who', 'house', 'arrest', 'McCarthy', 'playing', 'publicist', 'Davis', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'scenario', 'Reynolds', 'character', 'becomes', 'convinced', 'house', 'haunted', 'second', 'film', 'Reynolds', 'effeminate', 'TV', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'being', 'followed', 'reality', 'TV', 'camera', 'film', 'progress', 'make', 'pilot', 'McCarthy', 'Reynolds', 'best', 'friend', 'Davis', 'TV', 'exec', 'final', 'scenario', 'Reynolds', 'high', 'profile', 'video', 'game', 'designer', 'married', 'McCarthy', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'forest', 'when', 'Reynolds', 'find', 'help', 'Davis.The', 'way', 'film', 'episode', 'other', 'presenting', 'different', 'perspective', 'also', 'sharing', 'common', 'themes', 'way', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'fit', 'together', 'epiphany', 'end', 'film', 'startling', 'new', 'take', 'film', 'whole', 'August', 'terrific', 'job', 'creating', 'common', 'themes', 'central', 'thread', 'episode', 'even', 'when', 'still', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'happened', 'never', 'feel', 'cheated.It', 'very', 'heady', 'film', 'more', 'intelligent', 'lot', 'films', 'share', 'similar', 'themes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reference', 'particular', 'films', 'going', 'heavy', 'spoiler', 'territory', 'will', 'say', 'Nines', 'touches', 'religion', 'philosophy', 'technology', 'reality', 'how', 'everything', 'also', 'intent', 'discussing', 'life', 'whole', 'entire', 'concept', 'creation', 'creators', 'coincidence', 'scenarios', 'are', 'based', 'people', 'living', 'certain', 'kind', 'reality', 'more', 'reelity', 'reality', 'weight', 'film', 'shoulders', 'terrific', 'cast', 'Reynolds', 'particular', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'plays', 'three', 'starkly', 'different', 'characters', 'aplomb', 'earlier', 'roots', 'teen', 'comedy', 'far', 'best', 'role', 'was', 'amazing', 'watching', 'three', 'roles', 'Meanwhile', 'Nines', 'also', 'shares', 'actress', 'Go', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'steals', 'show', 'ray', 'light', 'scene', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'play', 'very', 'interesting', 'role', 'story', 'whole', 'McCarthy', 'tops.The', 'Nines', 'film', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'have', 'intelligent', 'conversation', 'complicated', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'today', ""n't"", 'provide', 'answers', 'Even', 'when', 'resolution', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'pieces', 'hands', 'Watching', 'included', 'short', 'film', 'as', 'close', ""'ll"", 'come', 'answer', 'So', 'best', 'bet', 'watch', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'want', 'talk', 'Nines', 'definitely', 'talking-about', 'film.I', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'fans', 'metaphysical', 'puzzles', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'provide', 'easy', 'answers', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'entertaining', 'film']",The Nines
