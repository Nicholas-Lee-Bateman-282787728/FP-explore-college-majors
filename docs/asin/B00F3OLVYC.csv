The antics that goes on between the dogs and the thieves reminds me of the comedic but much funnier and better playing thieves in Home Alone. In fact, this is almost like a spin-off from the Home Alone movies with the dogs and thieves but done in bad taste. No imagination here!It's worth the viewing if you have time on your hands and want to watch something with a &#34;little&#34; comedy and cute story line. Last but not least, personally, I can't stand when they have real dogs &#34;talking&#34; in movies. It just ruins the movie altogether in my opinion. I feel this would've been a MUCH better movie had they not added the talking and the moving mouths of the dogs. How beyond unrealistic can a movie get than this? Such a shame! Anyway, def. a 3 star rating because of the effort to make someone laugh but it def. won't win any awards. BTW, saw this movie on Netflix. Would NEVER purchase it for myself. Last word: Kudos to the dogs I must say ... in my book, they made the movie! They were the REAL stars!",3,Slow Movie AND Talking Dogs???

1670375,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B00F3OLVYC,mk,"[1, 1]","Shades of Home Alone but with a pair of talking to themselves dogs and taking place in the Canadian North, this comedic film is a hit with the kiddoes.Recently married, a famous actress, along her niece, move in with her husband, a  widower and his son, at his house in the Great White North.  Leaving the teens in the care of a babysitter, the newlyweds head off for a week on their honeymoon.At first, the children are at odds and so are their dogs.  The dogs lips move when they speak to each other, and there's plenty of silliness when two inept thieves attempt and attempt and attempt to steal a diamond from the house.  Lots of slapstick made our kids(ages 7& 10) laugh as the dogs team up to, repeatedly, thwart the baddies in totally ridiculous fashion.The dogs are well trained, and overall the movie's well made; although, some adults may get bored quickly.  It's all done for the kids' humor and point of view with nothing scaring or threatening.  Filmed in Regina, Saskatchewan with plenty of snow.",4,"Silly but Cute, Totally Kid Approved",1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,1010,"['Shades', 'Home', 'Alone', 'pair', 'talking', 'dogs', 'taking', 'place', 'Canadian', 'North', 'comedic', 'film', 'hit', 'kiddoes.Recently', 'married', 'famous', 'actress', 'niece', 'move', 'husband', 'widower', 'son', 'house', 'Great', 'White', 'North', 'Leaving', 'teens', 'care', 'babysitter', 'newlyweds', 'head', 'week', 'honeymoon.At', 'first', 'children', 'are', 'odds', 'so', 'are', 'dogs', 'dogs', 'lips', 'move', 'when', 'speak', 'other', 'plenty', 'silliness', 'when', 'two', 'inept', 'thieves', 'attempt', 'attempt', 'attempt', 'steal', 'diamond', 'house', 'Lots', 'slapstick', 'made', 'kids', '7', '10', 'laugh', 'dogs', 'team', 'up', 'repeatedly', 'thwart', 'baddies', 'totally', 'ridiculous', 'fashion.The', 'dogs', 'are', 'well', 'trained', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'adults', 'may', 'get', 'bored', 'quickly', 'done', 'kids', 'humor', 'point', 'view', 'nothing', 'scaring', 'threatening', 'Filmed', 'Regina', 'Saskatchewan', 'plenty', 'snow']",Step Dogs
