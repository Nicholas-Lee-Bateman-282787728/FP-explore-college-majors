Although set in World War II,  the movie is about a relationship between an elderly shopkeeper and the Slovakian carpenter Anton ""Tono"" Brtko who lives with his nagging wife.  Tono. is given the assignment of Arayan, the regulation of taking over the business while Jews are sent away to labor camps.  He meets Mrs. Lautmann, an elderly lady, sometimes confused and/or deaf, who owns a button shop.  The relationship these two display is often endearing and yet complex.Shop on Main Street is a two hour black and white film, and received an Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1965.  The superb performance by Ida Kaminska (Mrs. Lautmann) was nominated for the Oscar's Best Actress Award.Some may claim the translations are not done well, but that is understandable.  It is said that we lose about 20 percent of translations in foreign film.  However, you need to keep your trigger finger on the subtitles as especially during the first hour, the titles rush by.  During the first hour, the viewer establishes a bond with Tono, feeling for a strong like for him, his attention to the elderly lady, but understandably, there is a change to his personality that we have to respect.The acting by everyone was superb, especially with Tono, who endures an event that confuses his relationship and bond with the old lady.  We read his pain, clearly displayed all over his troubled face.  All the characters had meaningful roles.  What is most profound is the entire setting of a Czech town and people contently  mulling around.  One can easily become absorbed into that historic setting.For the longest time, I had meant to see this, and I was a little reluctant about the Halocaust aspect, and didn't want to see that horror, but as I said, it is about a wonderful relationship between a man and an elderly woman.  It is engaging and fun, sad and tense, real and dreamlike.  Unfortunately, there are no commentaries in the DVD. Criterion would have done that well, but it falls short here.

They become fond of each other, and when the Jews are eventually rounded up for deportation, he tries to protect her.It's not easy for him, however, because he knows if caught he'll be killed: it's quite a tug-of-war with his conscience - and very realistic.

(It's the same moral dilemma Huck goes through on the raft involving Jim.) In a fracas with her he accidentally kills her. Broken in every way, he soon hangs himself.The ending is the movie's only flaw, only because it's too drawn out, with a surrealistic dream sequence included in which he assumes the role of her husband, both dressed in old costume.

Tony, no sympahizer to the Nazi cause, takes on the duties begrudgingly, but becomes increasingly more involved as he realizes what fate will gradually meet Rozalie.  Things reach a shattering conclusion at the climax, as Tony is met by her frustrating oblivion to the danger she is in.Ida Kaminska has received most of the attention in regards to this film.  Hollywood even recognized her with a Best Actress Academy Award nomination in 1966.  But the standout for me was Jozef Kroner, playing a quiet, mostly lazy man who is forced against his will into the role of hero.  Watching his performance is like watching a raw nerve.  I had some slight problems with the director's obsession on comparing Tony to Christ (he's a carpenter, he repeatedly is shown having his feet bathed), but this is a minor complaint about a film that packs a tremendous emotional wallop.  I defy anyone to forget the last painful, lingering image of the film (I won't give it away), that simultaneously comments on the world that is and laments the world that could be.Grade: A",5,Heartbreaking,1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,1343,"['Shop', 'Main', 'Street', 'story', 'Tony', 'Brtko', 'Jozef', 'Kroner', 'assigned', 'Aryan', 'supervisor', 'small', 'shop', 'run', 'Rozalie', 'Lautman', 'Ida', 'Kaminska', 'doddering', 'old', 'lady', 'mind', 'mostly', 'gone', 'fog', 'seemingly', 'unaware', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'raging', 'Tony', 'sympahizer', 'Nazi', 'cause', 'duties', 'begrudgingly', 'increasingly', 'more', 'involved', 'what', 'fate', 'will', 'gradually', 'meet', 'Rozalie', 'Things', 'reach', 'shattering', 'conclusion', 'climax', 'Tony', 'met', 'frustrating', 'oblivion', 'danger', 'in.Ida', 'Kaminska', 'received', 'most', 'attention', 'regards', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'even', 'recognized', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', '1966', 'standout', 'was', 'Jozef', 'Kroner', 'playing', 'quiet', 'mostly', 'lazy', 'man', 'who', 'forced', 'will', 'role', 'hero', 'Watching', 'performance', 'watching', 'raw', 'nerve', 'had', 'slight', 'problems', 'director', 'obsession', 'comparing', 'Tony', 'Christ', 'carpenter', 'repeatedly', 'shown', 'having', 'feet', 'bathed', 'minor', 'complaint', 'film', 'tremendous', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'defy', 'anyone', 'forget', 'last', 'painful', 'lingering', 'image', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'simultaneously', 'comments', 'world', 'world', 'could', 'be.Grade']",N/A

I even bought and read the book by Ladislaw Grosman 17 years ago in anticipation of seeing the movie some day.  I must admit that the book was impressive but not THAT impressive and so I worried that the movie might be anticlimatical.  It wasn't.  The book was a long short story, a novella, if you will.  It laid out the story clearly enough but it was the movie that brought all of the characters to life and created the gradual development of the impending crisis.  By the time we reached that crisis we had met a few jerks and unimpressive characters.  However, we had also come to know and appreciate a number of people that we found endearing for different reasons.  As events darken the scene, we suspect something bad is about to happen.  I knew what it was going to be but it still had an impact for me.The two main characters in ""The Shop on Main Street"" are an elderly Jewish woman, played outstandingly by Ida Kaminska, and a neer-do-well Slovakian carpenter, played impressively by Josef Kraner.  The way these two come to interact with each other and the ebb and flo of their relationship is the heart of the movie.  The picture gives a personal look at the Final Solution as it is played out in a small Czech village.  The emotions that the director brings out on film is where the movie soars above the book.Watching ""The Shop on Main Street"" is a moving experience.

She dreams of a better life and constantly compares Antonin to his brother-in-law who is a Nazi officer in the city.One fine day, at a small family gathering and whilst miserably drunk, Antonin's brother-in-law hands him the ""Aryan"" ownership papers for a button shop on the main street that is being run by an elderly and near-deaf Jewish lady, Mrs. Lautman.Antonin is a reluctant owner and is easily outmaneuvered and outsmarted by Mrs. Lautman. Antonin eases into his ownership position by offering to help Mrs. Lautman in her day-to-day shop chores. At home, he spins a dominating owner story and is pestered by his greedy wife to search for a hidden cache of money & gold. Days go by and an unusual bond develops between Antonin & Mrs. Lautman. She treats him to some delectable homemade food and he helps her run her shop and paint her aging furniture whilst maintaining the veneer of being an owner.However, the holocaust looms large over the small city and the local Nazis are listing the Jews and sending them off to labor camps. Antonin dreads that Mrs. Lautman's name will be on the list of evacuees and she'll be condemned to a labor camp any day. He and a friend decide to hide Mrs. Lautman, but fear for the prospects of her being caught later. Antonin is clearly worried, but is unable to hatch a clear plan for Mrs. Lautman and is confused about keeping her in hiding or having her leave with fellow Jews. In his inept desperation and utter paranoia (seeing some Nazi officers closing in on the shop) he pushes Mrs. Lautman into a closet. The officers simply walk by the shop and the relieved Antonin rushes back to the closet to find a motionless and dead figure of Mrs. Lautamn. In his desperation he pushes her too hard and she falls to her death. Antonin is devastated and commits suicide. But, before hanging himself he lets his ever faithful dog out of the shop.The story is simple, but very hard hitting. Antonin's character is very innocent, kind and human. He is emotionally vulnerable and unable to handle the dark circumstances that the holocaust brought upon common people. The premise behind the eviction of Jews baffles him and leads to his own death.This is one of the best movies I've seen. I sat gazing at the credits and the blank screen long after the movie was over.

333570,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,630278333X,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0'The Shop on Main Street' was co-directed by J&aacute;n Kad&aacute;r and Elmar Klos. Klos was a Czeck and Kad&aacute;r, a Slovak born in Hungary. The setting of the film is a small town in Slovakia during the early part of World War II. Slovakia (which became The First Slovak Republic) was the only country along with Germany and the Soviet Union to invade Poland when the war started. Slovakia was forced to declare independence by Germany and a puppet regime was set up with Jozef Tiso as president and Vojtech Tuka, Prime Minister. Tuka was far more radical than Tiso and headed the pro-Nazi wing of the Slovak People's Party. The wing was supported by the Hlinka Guard, who sported the double cross symbol on their uniforms. In the film, a giant tower featuring the double cross is built in the center of town. The deportation of the Jews (a key element of the plot) was facilitated by Tuka. Approximately 57,000 Jews were deported up until 1942, when various factions in Slovakia got wind that the Jews were not being deported to labor camps, but rather were being exterminated. The deportations stopped for about two years when Slovakia insisted that further deportations would affect their economy in a deleterious way. In 1944, a national insurrection against the Nazis (the Slovak National Uprising) led to a Nazi take-over of the country. Deportations of Jews began again and even as late as March 1945, large numbers of Jews were murdered.'The Shop on Main Street' primarily addresses the issue of the ordinary man's response to living in a society under the yoke of fascist oppression. Our protagonist is T&oacute;no Brtko, an often unemployed carpenter who lives in a modest home with his henpecking wife, Evelyna. T&oacute;no's brother-in-law, Markus Kolkotsk,is commander of the Fascist guards. In an excellent scene where we really get to meet the characters for the first time, Kolkotsk and his wife pay his in-laws a visit at their house and they all get drunk. T&oacute;no is angry at his brother-in-law for not doing more for him given his position as the town commander. Kolkotsk surprises T&oacute;no when he hands him a document, appointing him 'Aryan' manager of a Jewish button store (hence the shop on Main Street). You'll note that at this point, T&oacute;no has no guilt feelings about making a deal with the devil, accepting the confiscation of the store (and his position as manager), as a fait accompli.When he arrives at the store, he finds it owned and operated by an elderly Jewish widow, Mrs. Lautmannov&aacute; , who's hard of hearing and slightly senile. Kuch&aacute;r, an accountant and righteous Gentile resistance fighter, reveals that Lautmannov&aacute; primarily relies on donations from the Jewish community and most of the stock in the store is depleted. Nonetheless, T&oacute;no agrees to an arrangement that if he acts as the 'Aryan manager', the Jewish community will pay him to look after Mrs. Lautmannov&aacute; and make sure no harm comes to her.Gradually, T&oacute;no takes a liking to Mrs. Lautmannov&aacute; and when he learns that the Jewish community is about to be deported, he becomes a righteous Gentile and is determined to save her. T&oacute;no becomes so militant for the just cause of sticking up for the Jews, that he ends up beating his bigoted wife, who is convinced that Mrs. Lautmannov&aacute; is hoarding money. Unlike the famed Oskar Schindler and the Polish sewer worker, Socha, in the film 'In Darkness', T&oacute;no is in a position where he can only attempt to save one Jew. Unfortunately, it soon becomes apparent to both T&oacute;no (and the audience) that he has no chance of success in saving the elderly woman, especially after Kuch&aacute;r is arrested for helping the Jewish community and dragged through the streets with a sign posted on his chest, 'Friend of the Jews', soon to meet a horrible, excruciating death.Directors Kad&aacute;r and Klos are on solid ground by not glossing over the fact that a certain segment of Slovakian society was wickedly anti-semitic and actively collaborated with the Nazis in the deportation of the Jews. In fact, in 'The Shop on Main Street', you never see any Germans--the deportations are carried out by local Nazi supporters. Even those 'ordinary' people such as T&oacute;no's wife, are not immune from basic prejudices as evidenced by her diatribe against Mrs. Lautmannov&aacute;. Before his epiphany, T&oacute;no is also unashamed, taking money from the Jewish community while participating in the illegal confiscation of Mrs. Lautmannov&aacute;'s shop.Despite Kad&aacute;r and Klos' admirable chronicling of the dark side of a segment of the Slovakian people, they are still determined (as other filmmakers who come from countries who collaborated with the Nazis) to show that there were still good people amongst the bad apples. Kuch&aacute;r is one of the good ones and T&oacute;no becomes one. Unlike Schindler, T&oacute;no is trapped and is forced to make a 'Sophie's Choice-like' decision. Shall he push Mrs. Lautmannov&aacute; out the door into the waiting hands of the Fascist Guards? Or into a closet in order to hide her? SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. Unfortunately, the 'push' is an ambivalent one--he's angry with her because her cause is hopeless and she should at least realize it but somehow he also is trying to think of a way he can save her. He ends up pushing her too hard into the closet and the ensuing fall causes her death.Are Kad&aacute;r and Klos trying to assuage their own guilt by turning T&oacute;no into a martyr? The message here is that not all Slovakians were bad during that time. But I think it would have been more realistic if T&oacute;no lived with his guilt over Mrs. Lautmannov&aacute;'s death. His ambivalent actions, where at one point he's thinking about saving his own skin, were normal. By having him commit suicide, T&oacute;no adopts a Christ-like mantle, unrepresentative of the average Slovakian's response to the harrowing reality of the times they were living in.",3,Righteous Gentile's martyrdom may not ring true but chronicle of collaborators' complicity in the Holocaust hits the mark,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,6091,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers',
