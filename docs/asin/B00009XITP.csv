759218,A3UE57S8G2G72Y,B00009XITP,A Customer,"[2, 2]","This movie reminds me of my father and I. A girl wants a father because he is irreplaceable. I know this is a modern society and there are other ways for a woman to have children, but as an old-fashioned girl, I think everyone should have an extraordinary father like my dad. I also thought all the actors and actresses were wonderful, but I especially love Colin Firth, Amanda Bynes, Kelly Preston, the guy who played Amanda's boyfriend, and the actress who played Colin's mum. They play some really nice songs in this film. One of my absolute favourites is Have I Told You Lately and it fits the scene in which it was played so well. It's one of the best scenes you'll ever watch, if not the best. Another is You Get Me and it's also good for the scene, too, which is also great--Amanda on a date with her boyfriend. How very lovely. There's also a song Amanda's boyfriend sings in a party (before a James Brown song). It's called Long Time Coming. Anyway, the guy really sang it so beautifully. Look out for the scene where he and Amanda have their first kiss 'cause it's so romantic. These aren't the only great scenes. Just do yourself a favour and watch it. You'll be glad that you did. The characters are believeable. This is truly a great film and it's not rated R, so this is a great family film.

Lee,"[3, 4]","When I travelled to southern california last year to attend my niece's college graduation, my brother brought some DVD's with him and he showed me this one in particular. (It was his daughter who was graduating.) After watching it I understood why he showed me this one (out of all the dvd's he had) and why he liked it. It's a story of a girl who goes to find the father she never got to know and the father who wasn't even aware he had a daughter. Its about their new relationship and about what is most important in a person's life, relationships... not your career, your status, money, or power, etc.  In this case the relationship between a father and his daughter. It's not a chick-flick (by my definition thats a movie about a romantic love relationsip). This is a great family film for parents and children to see and for all to appreciate each other. As one young lady reviewer stated 'it made me appreciate my dad'. Hopefully it will also be a thoughtful reminder to fathers about their relationship with their kids.

Okay, so it's not the most original story ever, (girl wants to find dad, girl discovers that being herself is better than pretending to be someone else, etc.) but it still felt lightweight and fresh. I've seen this movie several times and I enjoy it every time I see it. The basic premise of the story is sweet and relatively well written (especially compared to other sloppily made 'teen' movies), and the characters are enjoyable. I especially like Daphne's (the very watchable and perky Amanda Bynes) relationship with her father (the brilliant, to say the least, Colin Firth), which the story mostly revolves around. The setting in London is fun and sets up a bit of British humour (got to love the Brits).

759228,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00009XITP,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","So the film is a predictable clich&eacute;, but it's so much fun and Amanda Bynes (I just heart her) is just so charming in her ridiculousness.  I swear that she plays the same dim-witted cutie in every film, but it works for her.  She likes to fall a lot, which can get old, but whatever; I like watching her.  She's funny in a way that makes you feel like you've known her for years and `that's just the way she is'.  The story here is a tad `overdone'.  Bynes' plays a young girl who has lived her whole life with her musician mother, longing for the day when she would meet her father.  Her father, it turns out, is a British lord who has no idea she even exists.  So, young Daphne slips out of her mother's sight and high-tails it to Britain to confront her father for some much needed `daddy/daughter time'.  Problem is that her father is about to marry a terrible woman who has a terrible daughter of her own.  If you think that this won't end with a happy ending for all (well, at least for all the good people) then you obviously don't watch that many movies (more power to you) but whatever; it's the getting there that counts and both Bynes and Firth are incredibly charming and wonderful to watch.  Sure, the cinemaphile in me is screaming ""HOW DARE YOU WATCH THIS AND LIKE IT"" but the realist in me embraces the fact that not every movie is going up for Oscars.

She's a breath of fresh air in a world where many of the teenagers portrayed on TV and in films seem totally fake, but Amanda glows with originality and a ""I'm Not Trying To Be Britney"" attitude.

Her offbeat, rocker mother (played by Kelly Preston) isn't sure about letting Daphne go off into the ""real world"" to find her dad, considering that she was burned a long time ago by him (Well, according to her). But Daphne goes to England anyway, finds him, and tries to be the kind of daughter she thinks he wants, sacrificing her originality.Colin Firth is really funny and cute in this movie. He always impresses me, especially with his expressionate eyes, which reveal a million different emotions. Awesome supporting cast as well, plus a cutie newcomer named Oliver James, who even sings in the film (and yes, that's really him singing).Bottom line- Great movie for teen girls and I believe there is room for this movie to stretch to a wider audience besides just teen girls.

As you might expect Daphne's outgoing personality and unconventional ways of expressing herself cause an instant stir in the British elite and jeopardize her Father's chances of political success.Critique: Released in '03 `What A Girl Wants' is a predictable ""chick flick"" that exploits all the expected scenarios and pushes all the right emotional buttons that we've come to expect from this genre of film. Having that said you ask why then does it receive a -5 Star- rating? I can answer that in two words, Amanda Bynes. Nobody lights up the screen like the enchanting and talented Amanda.

Now it's 2K3 and Amanda is all matured and lookin' nice, and Iverson got a million tatts, and of course, is one of the top stars in the NBA. The point is, it's been six years!! Amanda has grown, y'all. This movie is really cool, I liked the scenes in the flea market or wherever they were in. I highly recommend this movie.

This is not a great movie, some of the casting is questionable, many of the jokes fall flat, the pratfalls are pitifully contrived but for some reason, it all seems to come together to make this one of those movies like Ghost, Mrs. Doubtfire and Dirty Dancing that doesn't seem to have a saturation point in how many times you can view it.  I think the reason it succeeds is due to the story itself.Daphne, a teenage girl played by Amanda Bynes runs off to England to meet the father she never knew and who never knew of his daughter's existence. Of course, Daddy isn't some average Joe but a Lord who is moving up in the world of politics.  Also included are an evil fiancee and an equally evil soon to be stepsister.  Of course, there is a charming young man she meets along the way.My only complaint about this movie is that it takes place only a few years ago and  while it can be said that Americans invented rock and roll (some 50 years ago), the ridiculous notion that only the American Daphne can save an otherwise stuffy party by asking the band to play a James Brown song which rescues the party from an otherwise certain bore fest is quite arrogant.

759261,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00009XITP,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[36, 42]","Among the current crop of female child actresses already or about to turn into hot properties for their impressive talent and major sex symbols for their knock-out looks is Amanda Bynes.  Its an impressive class that includes the names Keira Knightley, Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff and Kristen Bell. But Bynes is one actress who has already reached television stardom through her shows ""The Amanda Show"" and ""What I Like About You"" and at the age of 16 she traveled to Europe to appear in a movie appropriately titled ""American Girl.""Before it was released (in early 2003) its title had been changed to ""What a Girl Wants"" and I sat there in a movie theater knowing little about it. I knew it had been filmed in my home country and starred Colin Firth who had been so good in ""Bridget Jones' Diary,"" I came away impressed by the comic timing and the looks of an actress that would obviously in years-to-come set movie screens on fire.""What a Girl Wants"" is at its heart a story about a girl searching to find herself. Bynes plays Daphne Reynolds and her mother Libby is played by Mrs. John Travolta (Kelly Preston). The two live in New York City and Daphne spends her time helping out at weddings where her mother is a singer and longing to know a father she has never met. It is observing the father-daughter dance at one of these weddings (where the filmakers used real fathers and daughters) that our hearts go out to Daphne and she determines a drastic plan of action - traveling to London and confronting her absent father.The movie has it all - heart, laughter, suspense, romance. Its culture clash theme has been done before and better (Crocodile Dundee for example) but we have so much emotion invested in Daphne's plight that we cannot help but become engrossed in this movie.Jonathon Pryce proves that his villainous turn in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" was no fluke by pulling out a great performance here as the political advisor of Daphne's father (Firth). Thing is, Firth's character -Henry - is running for political office and Pryce sees Daphne as a liability to his boss' career and her presence an obstacle to his becoming father-in-law to the wealthy and politically powerful Henry.This DVD has an impressive number of special features, the crown jewels of which are the two scene specific audio commentaries, one by Bynes and the second by the director and two writers.I Liked how the subtitles automatically come up when commentaries are playing. If you have only seen it once it helps keep track of where you are in movie.Light, fluffy, exuberant Amanda Bynes chats about working with the other actors, and how intimidated she was by some of the people she worked with. In her commentary she mentions how the weather was when a scene was shot - it was hot, hunid, raining etcObviously Bynes has a great deal of respect for Firth and Preston and  almost inevitably Bynes spends a lot of time talking about clothes - big boots when hopping over the wall, commenting on how ugly the dress to a ball is etc. Bynes literally coos over emotional moments.Hers is a fun commentary, but there are some gaps. I liked the recounting of anecdotal moments such as her account of being mobbed by fans on bridge that crew could not get permission to close for shooting.On the second commentary director Dennie Gordon joined by the two writers Jenny Bicks and Elizabeth Chandler (the Amazon listing is incorrect in identifying them as actors).

The writers discuss such matters as how long they worked on it, the original inspiration and discuss different titles (the original title ""American Girl"" is mentioned on both tracks).

759275,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00009XITP,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","When it comes to this film, I am so utterly in the wrong demographics that I feel quite silly putting in my two cents' worth - but here it is, anyway. Sometimes you flip thru channels and stumble on a movie that you somehow end up seeing all the way thru. So, for me and WHAT A GIRL WANTS. Young Amanda Bynes has never really registered on my radar before, but it's hard not to get in her corner when you see her perky self go to work.Seems like nothing is original anymore. WHAT A GIRL WANTS has drawn comparisons toThe Princess Diaries (2-Disc Collectors Set), but apparently its roots go back further, to a 1958 comedy film THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE starring Rex Harrison and Sandra Dee, which in turn was adapted from a 1956 play of the same name by some cat named William Douglas Home. Cinderella, of course, is the grandmama of inspirations for movies like this.WHAT A GIRL WANTS is fluff fluffity fluff, but enjoyable and the sort of lighthearted, lightweight teen chick flick which the young girl audiences (and I guess, me) gobble up like M&Ms.; There's even a touch of that girl-empowerment thing going on. But if you say you can't guess how the plot will play out, then pardon me but my bullcrap detector just exploded. The set-up goes like this: 17 years ago, a young British noble (Colin Firth) and a gorgeous, free-spirited American girl (Kelly Preston) meet and fall in love in Morocco and get married in a bedouin wedding ceremony. He takes her to his posh estates in England, only to have disapproving forces scheme to separate the two. She leaves in tears, he lets her leave. He doesn't know she's pregnant.Amanda Bynes plays New York teenager Daphne Reynolds who runs away from her single parent mother to seek out her Englishman dad in London. To catch us up, Daphne's father is now Lord Henry Dashwood, currently engaged to be married and a popular candidate in the upcoming elections (and he still doesn't know he has a daughter). So, as you may guess, Daphne's unexpected arrival introduces a wrench in the works, a fly in the ointment, a fart in the wind. Bring on the belles and balls and the anticipated father-daughter culture clash, as the rest of the movie tells of how plucky and sweet collide with repressed and snooty.What's a story like this, though, without a wicked social-climbing stepmummy or a conniving step-sister? There's even a dashing young Jack-of-all-trades to lend a hand to Daphne, as well as a kindly British grandmum who we sense from the start would have Daphne's back and who ends up with film's best line (that one about hugs). But the real connection is between Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth's daughter and dad characters. It's quite fun watching Daphne gradually begin to have an effect on her stiff upper-lipped father and seeing this portrait of restraint and decorum loosen up by inches. The film's high point for me may well be that scene with Lord Dashwood in tight leather pants playing air guitar in front of the mirror.Bonus features? The DVD offers the following: two sets of audio commentary, one by the film director and the screenwriters, the other by Amanda Bynes (for those preferring a more, like, youthful testimonial); ""Fashion and Etiquette 101"" - the film's costume designer Shay Cunliffe goes over the cast's wardrobe and etiquette instructor Maggie O'Farrill nags about the proprieties; ""What's A Girl To Wear?"" - a game requiring a good memory for Daphne's outfits (as a guy, I refuse to play this); 3 additonal scenes (totalling 1 minute 39 seconds); the theatrical trailer; and the film cast & crew credits.WHAT A GIRL WANTS pushes all the right feel-good buttons and rides on the talent and credibility of the cast. Amada Bynes demonstrates an unaffected, likeable quality, nicely balancing her goofy exuberance with pratfalls and even a dash of romance. With her, the stodgy Brits never really had a chance. Equally key is Colin Firth, pitch perfect as the impeccable, uncomfortable Lord Dashwood, who as the film progresses regains that inner cool he had back in his youth, when he listened to rock 'n roll and sported a more hip wardrobe. Firth manages to pull off being simultaneously reserved yet charming. Again. Having seenPride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)andLove Actually (Widescreen Edition), I shouldn't be surprised. Kelly Preston is good as Libby, Daphne's beautiful Bohemian mom who raises Daphne to be carefree yet grounded; You could see why even after all these years Lord Dashwood still thinks of her. Libby is a wedding singer, which gives Preston a chance to actually sing the songs. She's not bad.Sappy last paragraph: This film may be tailored for the youngsters, but it doesn't necessarily snub the old fogies. When I told a buddy of mine that I'd seen this movie and liked it, he dismissed the film as fluff fluffity fluff. Obviously, I disagree. There's always a place for charming teen comedy flicks, not only in the hearts of young whippersnappers, but also in the wrinkled cockles of the decrepit. In its predictability and retelling of that same old message (be true to yourself), it doesn't insult our intelligence as much as reaffirm certain values. So I take back what I said about not being in this film's target demographics. With me, the film is apparently spot on.",4,Amanda Bynes gives them Brit stuffed shirts what fer,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,5296,"['When', 'film', 'am', 'so', 'utterly', 'wrong', 'demographics',

It also has romance, humor, sentimentality and true MAGIC.The leads, an absolutely outstanding Colin Firth as Henry Dashwood, is the uptight brit longing to find something to wake him out of the political career that has been shoved upon him, and bring him back to his more joyous and carefree youth.  By contrast there is the long lost daughter Daphne, perfectly cast Amanda Bynes who is the perfect one to do it.  Daphne is this exhuberant, sweet and fresh innocent faced girl who longs for the father she has never known as she has lived with mom Libby, also wonderful Kelly Preston.  Libby and Henry had a shortlived romance that was cut short but the reprehensible advisor that watched Henry's late dads political career.  Libby left Henry and found herself pregnant, but raised the baby herself.  Daphne, tired of never having that father/daughter dance, decides to run away to England and meet dear old dad.  Problem is, he is engaged to the advisors daughter Glynnis, an insufferable prig, and is about to gain a most snooty step daughter to boot.Daphne arrives in England and finds a singer as a first friend, Ian Wallace.  Encouraged by her new friend, she infiltrates the guarded fence to the palace and for the first time, father and daughter meet.To sum things up, the wonderful chemistry between the two leads is sheer magic.  Colin Firth has never been so wonderfully sympathetic as Lord Dashwood.  You have to love him as he is so convincingly flustered over his discovery, yet thrilled too.  Amanda Bynes as Daphne is wonderful and you have to root for her to win as grandma tells her &quot;They'll be rooting for you to fail&quot;.  Does Daphne win or lose her role in the heart of long lost dad Henry?  You MUST watch this film and find out for yourself.  No matter what your age, this film is one that will entertain, and touch your heart with characters you really do care about.  This alone makes &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; a true winner in every way.",5,You WILL Want it In YOUR Collection!,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,2390,"['originally', 'went', 'see', 'family', 'expecting', 'entertaining', 'fluffy', 'type', 'movie', 'amused', 'yet', 'empty', 'was', 'case', 'mediocre', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'outing', 'quot', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'Movie', 'quot', 'not', 'here.', 'quot', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'quot', 'amazingly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'people', 'will', 'hate', 'excitement', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'performances', 'also', 'romance', 'humor', 'sentimentality', 'true', 'MAGIC.The', 'leads', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Henry', 'Dashwood', 'uptight', 'brit', 'longing', 'find', 'something', 'wake', 'political', 'career', 'been', 'shoved', 'bring', 'back', 'more', 'joyous', 'carefree', 'youth', 'contrast', 'long', 'lost', 'daughter', 'Daphne', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'who', 'perfect', 'one', 'do', 'Daphne', 'exhuberant', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'innocent', 'faced', 'girl', 'who', 'father', 'never', 'known', 'lived', 'mom', 'Libby', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Libby', 'Henry', 'had', 'shortlived', 'romance', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'reprehensible', 'advisor', 'watched', 'Henry', 'late', 'dads', 'political', 'career', 'Libby', 'left', 'Henry', 'found', 'pregnant', 'raised', 'baby', 'Daphne', 'tired', 'never', 'having', 'father/daughter', 'dance', 'run', 'away', 'England', 'meet', 'dear', 'old', 'dad', 'Problem', 'engaged', 'advisors', 'daughter', 'Glynnis', 'insufferable', 'prig', 'gain', 'most', 'snooty', 'step', 'daughter', 'boot.Daphne', 'arrives', 'England', 'singer', 'first', 'friend', 'Ian', 'Wallace', 'Encouraged', 'new', 'friend', 'guarded', 'fence', 'palace', 'first', 'time', 'father', 'daughter', 'meet.To', 'sum', 'things', 'up', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'sheer', 'magic', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'sympathetic', 'Lord', 'Dashwood', 'have', 'love', 'so', 'convincingly', 'flustered', 'discovery', 'yet', 'thrilled', 'too', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'Daphne', 'wonderful', 'have', 'root', 'win', 'grandma', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rooting', 'fail', 'quot', 'Daphne', 'win', 'lose', 'role', 'heart', 'long', 'lost', 'dad', 'Henry', 'MUST', 'watch', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'entertain', 'touch', 'heart', 'characters', 'really', 'do', 'care', 'alone', 'quot', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'quot', 'true', 'winner', 'way']",N/A

After listening to the plot, I was skeptical - this &quot;modern-day Cinderella story&quot; seemed a bit too cheesy to be entertaining. Delightedly, I found it to be quite the opposite. While it will never make AFI's list of Greatest Movies, &quot;What A Girl Wants&quot; is a feel-good bit of fun.Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) is the favored political candidate in an upcoming House of Commons election. Serious, charming, and intelligent, Dashwood is the impeccable Englishman, with a London estate, a beautiful finacee, and a brilliant political career ahead of him. That is, until a 17-year old New York teenager named Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) arrives on his doorstep claiming to be the daughter he never knew existed.Daphne has long held a dream of developing a relationship with her long-lost father, and despite his initial reservations, Henry quickly falls in love with his daughter. However, the two are worlds apart. His life is one of garden parties and balls based on lineage and aristocracy; she is an energetic, vintage American teen. And though Henry used to be a loose canon himself, he finds that he must convince his daughter to change so that she can be accepted into his world.Though the film does feature the &quot;wicked stepmother and evil stepsister&quot;, it is mainly about the relationship between father and daughter and the importance of being true to oneself. With an all-star cast, including Bynes, Firth, Kelly Preston, and Jonathan Pryce, &quot;What A Girl Wants&quot; is more than mere fluff-it is a feel-good film with a fun plot and a bit of magic.

Finally deciding that she will have to find him, Amanda sets out to fulfill her dreams.  Her successful search lands her right in the middle of upper class British society, an impending marriage and a high-stakes political campaign.

If you are a fan of Colin Firth's and don't mind very lite-entertainment, this is a must-see.Once upon a time in Morocco, circa 1970-something, a young British Lord, Henry Dashwood, (Colin Firth), met American beauty, Libby Reynolds, (Kelly Preston), a young rock singer, and the two fell madly in love. A Bedouin tribal chief married them by the light of an African moon. Blessed with thoughts of 'happily ever after' they returned to London, the noble Dashwood family manse, and the real world of the British upper-classes. Dashwood retainers and advisors encouraged Libby, a commoner, to leave her husband for his own good, his future career, etc. After all, she was terribly unsuitable. And so Libby left England, with no explanation and returned to New York City, a walk-up apartment in Chinatown, and a career as a singer.Fast-forward 17 years. Apparently Libby left London with more than her luggage. She is the mother of a lovely and spirited teenager, Daphne, (Amanda Byrnes). Daphne Reynolds has almost everthing a girl could want. She's smart, caring, beautiful and possesses great flair. She has completed high school and has college and a lifetime of possibilities ahead of her. Her relationship with her Mom is open and loving, if somewhat unconventional. But she feels incomplete. Daphne knows all about her father, whom she has never met but has always longed for. Dashwood is totally unaware of his offspring's existance. Daphne always believed that someday her father would discover he had a daughter and come for her. After all these years of no-show Dad, she finally decides to take-off for London and make herself known to him. And the fun begins.Dashwood is engaged to a snobby, aristocratic bore, whose baggage includes a teenage daughter, even more boring than her mother - if that is possible. He has also resigned from the House of Lords and is beginning his political career running for office in the House of Commons. Enter Daphne. Surprise!The interaction and chemistry between Amanda Byrnes and Colin Firth make the film fun. The wicked stepmother and step-sister-to-be are terrific villains. You'll want to hiss and boo everytime they appear on screen. And Eileen Atkins, as Lady Dashwood, Henry's Mum, is wonderful. As her new found granddaughter hugs her, Atkins says, &quot;No hugs, dear. I'm British. We only show affection to dogs and horses.&quot; Oliver James, who plays Ian Wallace, Daphne's love interest, is charming and has a great voice. He's in a British rock band...what else?? The sound track is also quite good.&quot;What A Girl Wants&quot; will never receive an Oscar nomination. If you miss this film it is no big loss, unless you're a Colin Firth fan. This is an unusual role for him and he pulls it off really well. Great eye-candy!

In the original, the stepmother (played by the absolutely wonderful and radiant Kay Kendall, who died too soon and was the premier British comedienne of the 1950's) was, though a social-climbing flibbertigibbet, at heart a decent, good-hearted, well-intentioned woman who truly only wanted to do right by her stepdaughter and had a wonderful relationship with her husband (played by her real-life husband, Rex Harrison).

I really enjoyed this film about love lost and rebuilding broken relationships.  I still don't know how I missed this one in the theatre!  The acting is really superb, especially by Colin Firth who is outstanding, and he and Kelly Preston have such excellent chemistry.  The story has such a good balance of humour and touching moments, and it is very enjoyable with a good message. It also ties up all the loose ends nicely and leaves you with a happy feeling. It sort of reminds me of the Parent Trap a bit as well as Cinderella or the Princess Diaries. The scenes from Britain and Morocco are very nice and add to the cultural flavour of the film.  I also like how songs with such fitting lyrics are used to add to the emotion in the storyline.In terms of the acting, it is amazing how much Colin Firth can say with his eyes!! It is interesting because in this film we see so many different moods for Henry Dashwood, and unlike his role as Mr. Darcy, Colin Firth smiles quite a bit. He has such a nice smile and actually looks more like his fellow actor and brother Jonathan than I had previously thought (excellent actor too esp. in Victoria & Albert). During this film, because we see so many different sides of the character, I came away feeling that I knew Colin Firth a little better, even though it is about a fictional person.  Kelly Preston is really good as Libby and shows such touching emotion in her role as the woman who only ever loved one man. Amanda Bynes also does an excellent job and she is a great comedic actress.  There are some famous British stars in this film including Anna Chancellor, Eileen Atkins and Jonathan Pryce who also add class and talent to their supporting roles.Libby Reynolds is a singer who decides to go to see the world and meets Henry, her Knight in Shining Armour, in Morocco. ""They fall hopelessly and passionately in love"" and are married in a Moroccan wedding ceremony. They plan to make it official when they return to London, but his family and advisors get in the way. Henry is a man of Title and with the sudden death of his father, he is Lord Dashwood.  His advisor (Jonathan Pryce) tricks Libby into thinking that Henry wants her to leave, and convinces Henry that Libby leaves because she has another man.  Unknown to Henry, Libby is pregnant with their daughter Daphne. For 17 years Libby and Daphne live in China Town in New York.  Daphne works as a waitress at wedding receptions where her mother's band performs, and she feels sad when she watches the father-daughter dances (I cried during that part) and wishes for that kind of relationship with HER father. Every birthday Daphne always makes a wish that her father will come to find her, but her mother doesn't tell Henry because she is afraid her daughter will get hurt in the same way she did. Daphne always feels that part of her is missing because she doesn't know her father, and so when she is finished high school she goes to London to find him and also finds romance (Oliver James) along the way. Her father is engaged to the daughter of the advisor who got rid of Libby and is starting a political career. Eventually, Henry discovers what his true priorities are, and what he is willing to sacrifice to do the right thing and find true happiness.I would definitely recommend this film. There are a few mildly offensive words used, but everything else is as clean as a whistle.  The worst for me was the bejesus comment.  However, if you love romantic films, especially with a British flavour, you will love this movie.

It turns out he's next in line to be a Lord and his Dad (the current Lord) just died. Now the Evil Advisor (Jonathan Pryce) gets rid of the new Lord's true love to mould him into a proper English gent and such.Fast forward 17 years. Hippie girl was pregnant when run off the ranch, and now her daughter, Miss Wayout, wants to find her father. She jets off to London to find him (to strains of The Clash singing London Calling, of course) and it turns out he's a big politician about to be married to some troll from under a bridge. Miss Wayout (Amanda Bynes) arrives and is naturally all teenage and stuff, like, and she doesn't, like, fit in like, you know? Troll (daughter of original Evil Advisor) is trying to get rid of her so she can be the Lord's wife (once he gets into power of course). Unfortunately, Miss Wayout was just what the stuffy English doctor ordered, because all of English society loves her and her zany, madcap adventures. (You can guess the rest if you like, but I'll give it to you anyway).Aimed primarily at girls between ages ten through 18, this is nothing we've not seen before. Riddled with clich&eacute;s and awkwardness (Daphne falls over or bangs her head no less than five times) this is a very predictable film with very little to offer as a story (one thing I'd really like to know though, is why these films all promote `being yourself and individual' yet they all tell the same story in the same way? Isn't that a teensy bit hypocritical?)Anyway, while it has some moments of humour, to me it all smacks like a million other teenage girl films I've watched and by the end I was pretty glad it was over. Kelly Preston is wasted, Colin Firth and Jonathan Pryce are as well, and the supporting cast seem to get most of the screen time. This has also been very loosely based on The Reluctant Debutante, a stage play by William Douglas Home, but I'm fairly sure he wouldn't recognise it.",2,Nothing we haven't seen before...,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,2471,"['hard', 'work', 'cramming', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'can', 'film', 'success', ""n't"", 'always', 'forthcoming', 'however', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'announce', 'What', 'A', 'Girl', 'clich', 'eacute', 'level', 'been', 'maintained', 'fullest', 'rip', 'roaring', 'clich', 'eacute', 'success', 'Let', 'walk', 'now', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Daphne', 'Reynolds', 'hippie', 'mother', 'told', 'tale', 'how', 'cool', 'singer', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'met', 'mysterious', 'hippie', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Morocco', 'were', 'wed', 'Bedouin', 'style', 'then', 'went', 'London', 'where', 'hippie', 'guy', 'lived', 'out', 'next', 'line', 'be', 'Lord', 'Dad', 'current', 'Lord', 'just', 'died', 'Now', 'Evil', 'Advisor', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'rid', 'new', 'Lord', 'true', 'love', 'mould', 'proper', 'English', 'gent', 'such.Fast', 'forward', '17', 'years', 'Hippie', 'girl', 'was', 'pregnant', 'when', 'run', 'off', 'ranch', 'now', 'daughter', 'Miss', 'Wayout', 'find', 'father', 'London', 'find', 'strains', 'Clash', 'singing', 'London', 'Calling', 'course', 'out', 'big', 'politician', 'be', 'married', 'troll', 'bridge', 'Miss', 'Wayout', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'arrives', 'naturally', 'teenage', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'fit', 'know', 'Troll', 'daughter', 'original', 'Evil', 'Advisor', 'trying', 'get', 'rid', 'can', 'be', 'Lord', 'wife', 'once', 'power', 'course', 'Unfortunately', 'Miss', 'Wayout', 'was', 'just', 'what', 'stuffy', 'English', 'doctor', 'ordered', 'English', 'society', 'zany', 'madcap', 'adventures', 'can', 'guess', 'rest', 'like', ""'ll"", 'give', 'anyway', '.Aimed', 'primarily', 'girls', 'ages', 'ten', '18', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'before', 'Riddled', 'clich', 'eacute', 'awkwardness', 'Daphne', 'bangs', 'head', 'less', 'five', 'times', 'very', 'predictable', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'offer', 'story', 'one', 'thing', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'know', 'why', 'films', 'promote', 'being', 'individual', 'yet', 'tell', 'same', 'story', 'same', 'way', ""n't"", 'teensy', 'bit', 'hypocritical', 'Anyway', 'moments', 'humour', 'smacks', 'million', 'other', 'teenage', 'girl', 'films', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'end', 'was', 'pretty', 'glad', 'was', 'over', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'wasted', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'seem', 'get', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'also', 'been', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'Reluctant', 'Debutante', 'stage', 'play', 'William', 'Douglas', 'Home', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'sure', 'would', ""n't"", 'recognise']",N/A

759308,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00009XITP,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[28, 33]","&quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; is supposedly a remake of 1958's &quot;The Reluctant Debutante,&quot; although really the only thing in common is the idea of a young American girl (Sandra Dee) having to enter prim, proper, and priggish British society.  Besides, most teenagers will be convinced &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; is ripping off &quot;The Princess Diaries.&quot;  Anyhow for this 2003 film there are some additional complications.  Once upon a time dashing Englishman Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) hooked up with American hippie Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston).  While the legitimacy of their Moroccan marriage is in doubt there are two things we do know.  First, that Henry's family found a way to send the American misfit packing.  Second, after her return to the States Libby gave birth to a daughter, Daphne, who grows up to be Amanda Bynes.Of course Henry does not know about Daphne.  Of course Daphne manages to leave her apartment over the Chinese restaurant and get to England where she is able to surprise her father.  Of course Henry is about to marry a snobbish Englishwoman (Anna Chancellor) who has an equally ambitious and even more conceited daughter (Christina Cole) and neither of them can stomach Daphne's surprise arrival.  Actually, there is pretty much nothing in this film that is not a surprise, which is really something we should have known going into this one.  If Daphne has been dreaming all of her live of a father-daughter dance at a formal occasion then you can take a wild guess at to which scene in &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; is supposed to make you cry.These stories are all pretty much totally predictable.  But Kenneth Burke defined &quot;form&quot; as the creation of an appetite in the mind of an auditor and the satisfying of that appetite, which explains why this film is enjoyable for its targeted age and gender group (i.e., teenage girls for already adore Amanda from Nickelodeon).  Beyond that there is the charm evidenced by daughter and father in this film.  Bynes gets to have scenes where she is sassy and those where she gets to play dress up in a big way, while Firth gets to play a most reasonable British politician who has an inner free spirit just waiting to break out and start dancing in front of a mirror.There are some funny moments, usually as the expense of Daphne's father's future daughter-in-law, which usually involve putting some life into a series of stuffy British affairs.  Then there is Amanda's newly discovered grandmother who explains, &quot;No hugging, dear, I'm British.&quot;  It is clear the old lady is one of the few people in the film with her heart and her brains both in the right place and you wonder why she does not cut through all the nonsense and stop everyone from delaying the inevitable.  But &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; knows not only how this story is supposed to be told but exactly what its true source is when Daphne tells her nemesis: &quot;My evil step sister, you've seen Cinderella, right?  Let me clue you in. I win.&quot;Which, of course, she does.",4,Predictable from start to finish but still pretty enjoyable,1064707200,"09 28, 2003",2003,3061,"['quot', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'quot', 'supposedly', 'remake', '1958', 'quot', 'Reluctant', 'Debutante', 'quot', 'really', 'only', 'thing', 'common', 'idea', 'young', 'American', 'girl', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'having', 'enter', 'prim', 'proper', 'priggish', 'British', 'society', 'Besides', 'most', 'teenagers', 'will', 'be', 'convinced', 'quot', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'quot', 'ripping', 'off', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Diaries.', 'quot', 'Anyhow', '2003', 'film', 'are', 'additional', 'complications', 'Once', 'time', 'dashing', 'Englishman', 'Henry', 'Dashwood', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'hooked', 'up', 'American', 'hippie', 'Libby', 'Reynolds', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'legitimacy', 'Moroccan', 'marriage', 'doubt', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'do', 'know', 'First', 'Henry', 'family', 'found', 'way', 'send', 'American', 'misfit', 'packing', 'Second', 'return', 'States', 'Libby', 'gave', 'birth', 'daughter', 'Daphne', 'who', 'up', 'be', 'Amanda', 'Bynes.Of', 'course', 'Henry', 'not', 'know', 'Daphne', 'course', 'Daphne', 'leave', 'apartment', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'get', 'England', 'where', 'able', 'surprise', 'father', 'course', 'Henry', 'marry', 'snobbish', 'Englishwoman', 'Anna', 'Chancellor', 'who', 'equally', 'ambitious', 'even', 'more', 'conceited', 'daughter', 'Christina', 'Cole', 'can', 'stomach', 'Daphne', 'surprise', 'arrival', 'Actually', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'film', 'not', 'surprise', 'really', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'going', 'one', 'Daphne', 'been', 'dreaming', 'live', 'father-daughter', 'dance', 'formal', 'occasion', 'then', 'can', 'take', 'wild', 'guess', 'scene', 'quot', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'quot', 'supposed', 'make', 'cry.These', 'stories', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'totally', 'predictable', 'Kenneth', 'Burke', 'defined', 'quot', 'form', 'quot', 'creation', 'appetite', 'mind', 'auditor', 'satisfying', 'appetite', 'why', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'targeted', 'age', 'gender', 'group', 'i.e.', 'teenage', 'girls', 'already', 'adore', 'Amanda', 'Nickelodeon', 'Beyond', 'charm', 'evidenced', 'daughter', 'father', 'film', 'Bynes', 'have', 'scenes', 'where', 'sassy', 'where', 'play', 'dress', 'up', 'big', 'way', 'Firth', 'play', 'most', 'reasonable', 'British', 'politician', 'who', 'inner', 'free', 'spirit', 'just', 'waiting', 'break', 'out', 'start', 'dancing', 'front', 'mirror.There', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'usually', 'expense', 'Daphne', 'father', 'future', 'daughter-in-law', 'usually', 'involve', 'putting', 'life', 'series', 'stuffy', 'British', 'affairs', 'Then', 'Amanda', 'newly', 'discovered', 'grandmother', 'who', 'quot', 'No', 'hugging', 'dear', ""'m"", 'British.', 'quot', 'clear', 'old', 'lady', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'film', 'heart', 'brains', 'right', 'place', 'wonder', 'why', 'not', 'cut', 'nonsense', 'stop', 'everyone', 'delaying', 'inevitable', 'quot', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'quot', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'story', 'supposed', 'be', 'told', 'exactly', 'what', 'true', 'source', 'when', 'Daphne', 'nemesis', 'quot', 'My', 'evil', 'step', 'sister', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Cinderella', 'right', 'Let', 'clue', 'win.', 'quot', 'Which', 'course']",N/A

Truthfully, I actually did want to watch it because I thought it might be funny, and it looked similar to ""The Princess Diaries,"" which I also enjoyed.  I was pleased that the movie turned out to be watchable and fun.Daphne Reynolds is a young woman in New York who yearns to know her father.  As she grows up, she becomes more and more distressed by the possibility that she will never have a chance to know her father.  After watching a father-daughter dance at a wedding one day, she decides it is time to act and go off to find him.Daphne was the result of a romance between her free-spirited mother, Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston), and Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), who once was as free-spirited as Libby, but ultimately succumbed to the prim and proper expectations of the British upper class, and Libby was left behind.  Unbeknownst to Henry, he left Libby with a gift:  Daphne.  In case you were wondering, Libby and Henry were legally married in Morocco, though various characters attempt to obscure the legality of that marriage.Daphne has entered the scene at a very critical point in Henry Dashwood's life.  He has given up his hereditary position in the House of Lords to run for elected office.  Most especially interested in his success are Alistair Payne (Jonathan Pryce), Glynnis Payne, his fianc&eacute;, and Clarissa Payne.  Naturally all three of these characters want what's best for them, and not what's best for Henry.  Dahne's free-wheeling ways do not sit well with any of these three characters, and they impress upon Henry that to win the election he needs to bring Daphne back under control.Daphne succumbs to the pressure of being the daughter of British royalty and becomes the beautiful, dutiful daughter, and adopts a type-B personality demeanor.  We all know that Daphne's irrepressible energy and type-A personality will have to win out, and remaining the meek, dutiful daughter is not her path.As with a recent, similar movie, ""The Princess Diaries,"" this movie has a fair amount of predictability, clich&eacute; and stereotype.  However, as with the earlier movie, this movie too is a winner.  The real success in this case is from Amanda Bynes and her interaction with Colin Firth.  Colin sees in Amanda the person he truly is, and he sees that he similarly stifled his true character to fit into the expected mold.  Amanda has virtually no interest in Colin's position or wealth.  She is who she is; her real goal has always been to gain a father, not money or status.We love Daphne because she is a bit eccentric, but she is all-American, and engagingly normal.  We find by the end of the movie that being pretentious should not be a cover for whom or what we want to be.  Sure, the plot is contrived, but who cares?  It's way too much fun to worry about such trivialities.

Since I have no cable television, Amanda Bynes is a new face for me. Colin Firth is quite convincing as Lord Henry Dashwood, and Bynes, although forced to make some typical American mess-ups as the script mandates, does an admirable job as the young, impetuous, but ultimately caring, good-hearted heroine. I have to say, though, that the best character for me was Oliver James, not because of his acting abilities, which were not thoroughly explored, but his singing voice needs to get more credit. In truth, he should release an album over here in the States. Those two songs on the soundtrack just don't give me enough! Speaking of the soundtrack, I love how they used ""I Wanna be Bad""! I wish they had played the entire song during the film! The caniving, devious step-sister and mother, (rather like Cinderella, don't you think)? are decent as well, and the grandmother is extremely funny in the little screen time she is given.

Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) was an English gentleman destined for political greatness.  Little did he know that his life would be turned upside-down when the daughter he never knew suddenly showed up on his doorstep.  For Daphne, her life changes as well as she learns to adapt to the ""good life"" of a British aristocrat full of snobs and paparazzi.  In the end, both Daphne and Henry, through the help of family, friends as well as lovers, learn the true meaning of family and staying true to their hearts and selves.THE COOL THINGS:This is simply just a really nice movie on several levels.  The humor, while not bust-out-loud funny, is simple, nice and intelligent.  There is no profanity, no sexual innuendo, etc.  It's just a nice, pure, wholesome movie.  The movie's themes about the importance of family and of staying true to yourself are timeless.  The characters and situations they are placed in are simply charming.  Overall, this is just a plain nice movie to kick back and watch with the family.BEST SCENES:1. Breakfast at the Dashwood residence2. The fashion show3. Daphne and Ian's date4. Daphne's presentation ballTHE DVD FEATURES:The DVD comes with a decent set of extras for your perusal and listening pleasure.  Here are the goodies you get.1. Amanda Bynes commentary track2. Director commentary track3. ""Fashion and Etiquette 101"" - 8  minute featurette on the cast's wardrobe and etiquette lessons for the audience.4. ""What's a Girl to Wear"" - Mix and match game wear the player needs to mix 3 sets of Daphne's clothes.  You get rewarded with a short special video if you match all three sets.5. 3 deleted scenes.

The moving story of family and love is a refreshing change of pace in this world of sex and low brow comedy (not that there's anything wrong with that).  The humor of the movie is low-key and intelligent.  The DVD extras, while not overflowing like most new releases, add a nice touch to this already charmning movie.

759336,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00009XITP,Only-A-Child,"[3, 4]","""What a Girl Wants"" is a FAIRY TALE (insert ""Parent Trap"" here) so those who do not like that type of story need not watch, but just being a fairy tale is no basis for criticism. It is an updated remake of 1958's ""The Reluctant Debutante"" starring Sandra Dee and Rex Harrison, which itself was based on a 1956 play by William Douglas Home. Home is partially credited with both screenplays although he died in 1992. The basic premise is even older as the humble child who discovers a royal parent is a staple of ancient fairy tales.The current version is a pretty decent effort, you could even say that it is 2/3's of an excellent movie. It starts off nicely and proceeds in a very entertaining manner well past the midway point. You are just about to conclude that this is an extremely underrated film when the wheels fall off (insert Colin Firth whisking his daughter away on a motorcycle), from that point the film wobbles lamely along until it thankfully recovers its balance just before its final scene.The only other major problem is the clich&eacute; Yank-Brit characterizations and the exploitative use of the Royal Family in several scenes. Yanks are fun and funky, Brits are staid and stuffy, most upper class Brits are evil incarnate-with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. You are warned about it going in, this general stupidity is reflected by the promotional poster of an American flag t-shirt between the British guards. The exuberance of Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) would have played better if the other performances were toned down a few notches. Doubles of and references to the Royal Family are completely unnecessary and simply distract from what is supposed to be a father-daughter-bonding story.The best scene happens early, Daphne and her mother are working a local wedding when she discovers the missing groom passed out under a table. She puts ice down his shirt and when he emerges frantically twisting around to remove it, Daphne signals her mom's band to play ""Shout"" and then mimics the groom's movements.I see no basis for the criticism of Amanda Bynes in this film. She plays her high energy self and successfully ratchets back a few notches for the serious scenes. In essence director Dennie Gordon has her play two characters which is the basis of the story's theme as her character must reluctantly conform and work at being someone she is not. Under Gordon's direction and working with a skilled ensemble Bynes nails the character so well that it is hard to image anyone else in the role. She is not on Brittany Murphy's level yet but she progressing nicely.

William Douglas-Home is the younger brother of Sir Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, 14TH Earl of Home, Baron Home of the Hirsel of Coldstream, who, in October 1963 (8 years after the writing of the play from which this screen-play was adapted), disclaimed his peerages for life, took the name Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and succeeded Harold Macmillan as prime minister of England. The plot, therefore, is an insider's look at an outsider's view of the traditions, the glamour, and of course, the pain and hypocrisy of the British upper class. As such it succeeds remarkably. Sterling performances by Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth are ably complemented by a truly brilliant Anna Chancellor, who manages almost to make you like her ""wicked stepmother"" character, or at least feel sorry for her for being so shallow, and an excellent backup from Christina Cole as the evil step-sister-to-be.This is billed as a teen flick, but it's well worth the price of an evening's rental as wholesome, cute entertainment, no matter how old you are.Just for fun though, do pay attention to the gross continuity bloopers with the taxi license numbers.

759342,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,B00009XITP,Priscilla Stafford,"[10, 14]","When Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) and Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston) met in Morocco, it seemed like fate. Falling madly in love with each other, they marry and life seems perfect. That is until Henry and Libby through lies and deceptions are separated, Libby leaving for the States while Henry stays on in London. Little did Henry know that Libby was pregnant with Daphne (Amanda Bynes). Now seventeen-years-old, Daphne decides she's tired of waiting for her father and leaves for England, where Henry is now Lord Dashwood and a politically powerful figure setting up a campaign to earn a seat in Parliament. What follows is a tale of how a young girl and her father discover their true selves and find happiness.Conclusively falling under the category of a 'teen Cinderella story', &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; also ultimately falls into the doomed, classic genre of 'a cliched and utterly lifeless movie'. There have been several movies where the Cinderella premise works beautifully, the film which most comes to mind being &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;.Yet while &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; was like a breath of fresh air, &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; reeked with the stench of a plot so stale, it was hard not to gag at numerous scenes. Whenever there comes up a scene where Daphne 'livens things up', I just wanted to groan and think, &quot;Here we go again...&quot;But more importantly, it is the weak cast with their even weaker characters which adds mostly to the downfall of this film. For example, let me list up just a few of many stereotypical semi-minor characters this movie delivers:*The evil Glynnis Payne (Anna Chancellor) who has every intention of marrying Lord Dashwood for his power and money.*The equally evil daughter of the evil Glynnis, Clarisse Payne (Christina Cole) who will stop at nothing to make sure Daphne doesn't feel like she belongs.*The most evil of them all, Alistaire Payne (Jonathan Pryce), Lord Dashwood's chief advisor who had much to do with the deception that tore Henry and Libby apart.*And most sadly, though Oliver James was an amazingly talented singer, his character of Ian Wallace whom Daphne falls for is the formula boyfriend; very poor yet has a heart of gold.And just exactly were the writers thinking of when they added such inane characters such as Peach and Pear Orwood, the dimwitted twins, and Lord Orwood (Roger Ashton-Griffiths) the stuffy aristocrat?As for Amanda Bynes, she is definitely very cute and is quite energetic, but Bynes suffers in that her character of Daphne is quite two-dimensional, leaving no room for her to really act.By now, you are wondering, &quot;So why is this Priscilla Stafford giving this movie two stars if this movie stunk?&quot; Well, here's the reason: Colin Firth is what makes this film worth two stars. Every time he comes on screen, he makes you forget the inane plot and concentrate on his character of Henry Dashwood who is searching for true happiness. Here is an actor who puts strength behind a somewhat bland character and makes you eventually fall in love with him. With his British accent, incredible acting talent, and charmingly good looks, Colin Firth is what makes the movie worth the watch at all. Kelly Preston, too, was not that bad in her role. Sadly, she doesn't have enough film time but when she and Colin Firth are together, they dazzle the screen. It's a shame the movie didn't focus more on them.To finish up, &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; is nothing new. The ending is semi-good but doesn't give you that 'happy-happy' feeling most chick flicks give out and SHOULD give out. There are a few laughs during the film yet they seem few and sparse between. Teens might enjoy the loud pop music which is heard throughout the whole movie. Strictly for pre-teen girls, &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; is probably exactly what it is, only what girls want. Unless of course it's really Colin Firth you want then maybe you should watch this movie. But if you REALLY want Colin Firth, instead watch &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; or even the BBC miniseries &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. In those movies you'll REALLY see Colin Firth shine, and that is what we really want, isn't it? ^_^",2,&quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; was not exactly what was wanted...,1084492800,"05 14, 2004",2004,4219,"['When', 'Henry', 'Dashwood', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Libby', 'Reynolds', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'met', 'Morocco', 'seemed', 'like', 'fate', 'Falling', 'madly', 'love', 'other', 'marry', 'life', 'perfect', 'Henry', 'Libby', 'lies', 'deceptions', 'are', 'separated', 'Libby', 'leaving', 'States', 'Henry', 'stays', 'London', 'Little', 'did', 'Henry', 'know', 'Libby', 'was', 'pregnant', 'Daphne', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'Now', 'seventeen-years-old', 'Daphne', 'tired', 'waiting', 'father', 'England', 'where', 'Henry', 'now', 'Lord', 'Dashwood', 'politically', 'powerful', 'figure', 'setting', 'up', 'campaign', 'earn', 'seat', 'Parliament', 'What', 'tale', 'how', 'young', 'girl', 'father', 'discover', 'true', 'selves', 'find', 'happiness.Conclusively', 'falling', 'category', ""'teen"", 'Cinderella', 'story', 'quot', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'quot', 'also', 'ultimately', 'doomed', 'classic', 'genre', 'cliched', 'utterly', 'lifeless', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'movies', 'where', 'Cinderella', 'premise', 'beautifully', 'film', 'most', 'mind', 'being', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'quot', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'quot', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'quot', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'quot', 'reeked', 'stench', 'plot', 'so', 'stale', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'gag', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'Whenever', 'there', 'up', 'scene', 'where', 'Daphne', 'things', 'up', 'just', 'wanted', 'groan', 'think', 'quot', 'Here', 'go', 'again', 'quot', 'more', 'importantly', 'weak', 'cast', 'even', 'weaker', 'characters', 'mostly', 'downfall', 'film', 'example', 'let', 'list', 'up', 'just', 'few', 'many', 'stereotypical', 'semi-minor', 'characters', 'movie', 'delivers', '*The', 'evil', 'Glynnis', 'Payne', 'Anna', 'Chancellor', 'who', 'intention', 'marrying', 'Lord', 'Dashwood', 'power', 'money', 'equally', 'evil', 'daughter', 'evil', 'Glynnis', 'Clarisse', 'Payne', 'Christina', 'Cole', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'make', 'sure', 'Daphne', ""n't"", 'feel', '*The', 'most', 'evil', 'Alistaire', 'Payne', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'Lord', 'Dashwood', 'chief', 'advisor', 'who', 'had', 'much', 'do', 'deception', 'tore', 'Henry', 'Libby', 'apart', '*And', 'most', 'sadly', 'Oliver', 'James', 'was', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'singer', 'character', 'Ian', 'Wallace', 'whom', 'Daphne', 'formula', 'boyfriend', 'very', 'poor', 'yet', 'heart', 'gold.And', 'just', 'exactly', 'were', 'writers', 'thinking', 'when', 'added', 'such', 'inane', 'characters', 'such', 'Peach', 'Pear', 'Orwood', 'dimwitted', 'twins', 'Lord', 'Orwood', 'Roger', 'Ashton-Griffiths', 'stuffy', 'aristocrat', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'definitely', 'very', 'cute', 'quite', 'energetic', 'Bynes', 'suffers', 'character', 'Daphne', 'quite', 'two-dimensional', 'leaving', 'room', 'really', 'act.By', 'now', 'are', 'wondering', 'quot', 'So', 'why', 'Priscilla', 'Stafford', 'giving', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'movie', 'stunk', 'quot', 'Well', 'here', 'reason', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'what', 'film', 'worth', 'two', 'stars', 'time', 'screen', 'forget', 'inane', 'plot', 'concentrate', 'character', 'Henry', 'Dashwood', 'who', 'searching', 'true', 'happiness', 'Here', 'actor', 'who', 'strength', 'somewhat', 'bland', 'character', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'British', 'accent', 'incredible', 'acting', 'talent', 'charmingly', 'good', 'looks', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'what', 'movie', 'watch', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'too', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'role', 'Sadly', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'film', 'time', 'when', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'are', 'together', 'dazzle', 'screen', 'shame', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'more', 'them.To', 'finish', 'up', 'quot', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'quot', 'nothing', 'new', 'ending', 'semi-good', ""n't"", 'give', ""'happy-happy"", 'feeling', 'most', 'chick', 'flicks', 'give', 'out', 'SHOULD', 'give', 'out', 'are', 'few', 'laughs', 'film', 'yet', 'seem', 'few', 'sparse', 'Teens', 'might', 'enjoy', 'loud', 'pop', 'music', 'heard', 'whole', 'movie', 'Strictly', 'pre-teen', 'girls', 'quot', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'quot', 'probably', 'exactly', 'what', 'only', 'what', 'girls', 'want', 'course', 'really', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'want', 'then', 'maybe', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'REALLY', 'want', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'instead', 'watch', 'quot', 'Importance', 'Being', 'Earnest', 'quot', 'even', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'quot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'quot', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'REALLY', 'see', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'shine', 'what', 'really', 'want', ""n't"", '^_^']",N/A

My daughter had this movie and was watching it constantly on a recent boat trip, and darned if I didn't get hooked on it.  An impossibly cute Amanda Bynes plays a young American girl who is (unknown to her father) the daughter of a British Lord and politician (Colin Firth as the aptly-named Lord Dashwood is, well, dashing).  She impulsively flies to England to meet him, and therein lies a genuinely cute, funny, and touching story.  Maybe it is because I have a daughter of my own, but I found the chemistry between Bynes and Firth to be irresistable, and enough to overcome my usual antipathy to films of this genre.At times the storyline is a bit ""over the top"" but even for a hard-boiled character like myself it holds the viewer's interest throughout.  Obviously this is a take-off on the ""Cinderella"" theme, complete with the Evil Stepsister, and the film acknowledges that in a humorous way that I won't spoil for you.  The sets are gorgeous, the supporting cast is pretty good, and overall there is a great deal about this movie to like.My wife and daughter like these types of movies, and I am subjected to them on trips as a result.

Although, this movie doesn't explain much about the British and I can't really understand why the British people don't seem to express their emotions and feelings the way we do.After I finished watching it, my parents watched it  and they really liked it too.  One of the things that really surprised me and especially pleased my Dad was the Special Guest Appearances by the Queen of England, Prince Charles and his sons  (we got a close-up of his face).The Special Features on this DVD are 2 documents which can be considered 'making of' features as they play a big part in the movie and have scenes from the movie - they talk about ""the costumes and clothes of the characters"" and ""the importance of manners"", which can be quite handy in some circumstances of meeting such people (like your girlfriend's dad or making food, etc).

BUT, I DO REMEMBER A HIDDEN SPECIAL FEATURE:  If you click on the head of the Throne which Amanda Byrnes sits on (I believe in the 'Special Features Menu'), you get to see 2 takes on an audition for the Princess twins Peach and Pear.This Movie and DVD is really good, and if you, your parents or anybody else you know likes England, Amanda Byrnes, the Queen of England and Prince Charles, then I'm sure this will certainly be enjoyable.",5,Even my Parents liked this DVD!,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,1739,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'while', 'when', 'think', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'quite', 'well.I', 'missed', 'out', 'seeing', 'movie', 'cinemas', 'course', 'got', 'out', 'DVD', '3', 'Days', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'even', 'bad', 'characters', 'story', 'was', 'funny', 'had', 'lot', 'great', 'location', 'shots', 'England/London', 'LOVED', 'inside', 'English', 'Palace', 'Rooms', 'movie', ""n't"", 'explain', 'much', 'British', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'British', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'express', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'way', 'do.After', 'finished', 'watching', 'parents', 'watched', 'really', 'liked', 'too', 'One', 'things', 'really', 'surprised', 'especially', 'pleased', 'Dad', 'was', 'Special', 'Guest', 'Appearances', 'Queen', 'England', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'sons', 'got', 'close-up', 'face', 'Special', 'Features', 'DVD', 'are', '2', 'documents', 'can', 'be', 'considered', ""'making"", 'features', 'play', 'big', 'part', 'movie', 'have', 'scenes', 'movie', 'talk', 'costumes', 'clothes', 'characters', 'importance', 'manners', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'handy', 'circumstances', 'meeting', 'such', 'people', 'girlfriend', 'dad', 'making', 'food', 'etc', 'think', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exactly', 'BUT', 'DO', 'REMEMBER', 'A', 'HIDDEN', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURE', 'click', 'head', 'Throne', 'Amanda', 'Byrnes', 'sits', 'believe', ""'Special"", 'Features', 'Menu', 'get', 'see', '2', 'audition', 'Princess', 'Peach', 'Pear.This', 'Movie', 'DVD', 'really', 'good', 'parents', 'anybody', 'else', 'know', 'likes', 'England', 'Amanda', 'Byrnes', 'Queen', 'England', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'then', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'enjoyable']",N/A

Like that oldie, &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; is avout a girl Daphne played by Bynes, whose &quot;single&quot; mother (Kelly Preston) is a wedding singer.  One day, when Daphne is 17 years-old, she suddely wants to see her real father Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), who is going to be a MP, and marry a lady (Anna Chancellor, &quot;Duckface&quot; in &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;).No surprise that Daphne causes a havoc in the aristocratic society in UK; and no surprise that she wins the heart of some people there, especially that of Colin Firth and Eileen Atkins.  Well, the director Dennie Gordon's CV includes &quot;Ally McBeal,&quot; and the gags are often preposterous, and dialogues impossible, though in a delightful way ... if you're in a good mood.But the natural charms of Ms. Bynes goes unscathed among the hit-and-miss shots, and certainly the chemistry between Bynes and Firth is undeniable, and compensates the wasted Jonathan Pryce and the ill-used leather jacket and turban Colin Firth had to wear.I do understand the British people's dismay when watching the film -- it is often gratingly silly, but the Dashwood family (oh, they are really living in the house the film depicted) actually agreed to use the name, so stop complaining, please.

This movie, based upon the play ""The Reluctant Debutante"" follows our intrepid young star in her journey to meet her father, a stuffy British aristocrat, played with Bumbling Stammering Hugh Grantish perfection by Colin Firth, who's really better than the part written for him here. Byrnes and the filmmakers seem to think that staring vacantly, smiling, trying on hats and sunglasses, and dancing around to generic pop music passes for characterization these days. Wrong. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy; sweet, lacking nutrition and just plain bad for you. To top it all off the DVD itself is a wreck.

I had heard it being compared to The Princess Diaries, which isn't all that far off. It's another cute, girl power movie.Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) loves living in her apartment in Chinatown with her mom, but she really wants to know who her dad is. Her mom never really tells her, and Daphne still really, really wants to know him. What she does know, though, is that he lives in England. On her birthday, she uses her money to buy a plane ticket to London and plans to meet her dad. When she first arrives, Daphne is a bit overwhelmed.She meets a few friends along the way (Ian Wallace, the musician, is probably the most memorable), and they all tell her that she has to try to make peace with the fact that her dad is getting remarried to a completely horrible woman with an equally bad daughter. Of course, the movie wouldn't be complete without a few of Amanda's token pratfalls, but for once they're actually pretty funny.WHAT A GIRL WANTS is definately a cute movie, and it has a killer soundtrack. Highly recommended if you liked The Princess Diaries (one and two), A Walk to Remember, or How to Deal.Overall grade - A+",5,"A cute movie, sort of reminds me of The Princess Diaires",1097712000,"10 14, 2004",2004,1266,"['Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'loved', 'Amanda', 'Show', 'All', 'That', 'knew', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'WHAT', 'GIRL', 'WANTS', 'had', 'heard', 'being', 'compared', 'Princess', 'Diaries', ""n't"", 'far', 'cute', 'girl', 'power', 'movie.Daphne', 'Reynolds', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'living', 'apartment', 'Chinatown', 'mom', 'really', 'know', 'who', 'dad', 'mom', 'never', 'really', 'Daphne', 'still', 'really', 'really', 'know', 'What', 'know', 'England', 'birthday', 'money', 'buy', 'plane', 'ticket', 'London', 'plans', 'meet', 'dad', 'When', 'first', 'Daphne', 'bit', 'overwhelmed.She', 'few', 'friends', 'way', 'Ian', 'Wallace', 'musician', 'probably', 'most', 'memorable', 'tell', 'try', 'make', 'peace', 'fact', 'dad', 'getting', 'remarried', 'completely', 'horrible', 'woman', 'equally', 'bad', 'daughter', 'course', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'complete', 'few', 'Amanda', 'token', 'pratfalls', 'once', ""'re"", 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny.WHAT', 'A', 'GIRL', 'WANTS', 'definately', 'cute', 'movie', 'killer', 'soundtrack', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'liked', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'one', 'two', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'How', 'Deal.Overall', 'grade', 'A+']",N/A
