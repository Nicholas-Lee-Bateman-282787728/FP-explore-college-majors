1050420,A3TJJHMWV3SFNI,B000MRNWJM,"Brett Heitkam ""DVD obsessed""","[6, 7]","Gamebox 1.0 (originally titled Game Over) is NOT a horror movie as the cover art implies.  It is actually a very family friendly PG-13 sci-fi/action adventure movie involving a guy who gets sucked into a virtual reality video game where if he dies in the game, he dies in real life.This movie was made with a $200,000 budget, which is pretty impressive considering what the final product ended up looking like.  The first half of the movie, in which our hero is in a Grand Theft Auto-esque virtual world, looks wonderful.  The computer generated background is rich in detail and full of eye candy.  Once the movie shifts gears, and the characters end up in the next two games (ZombieLand and Alien Planet), the special effects are much less impressive, which was a bit disappointing.  It would be great if they would remake this movie with a ""movie theater quality"" budget!With that being said, the movie goes by very quickly and holds your interest.  The story is fascinating, and, unlike a lot of movies I have seen recently, the ending is actually very good and extremely satisfying.  This is a great movie for tweenage boys (8-12), especially ones that are into video games.  There is very little swearing, and all the violence is very toned down, such as when someone gets shot in the video game, there is just like a small smoking hole in their shirt and no blood.  I'm pretty picky about what our 10 and 11 year olds watch, but after screening this, I had no qualms about letting them see it; I knew it would be right up their alley, and they did love it!If this sounds like something you would be remotely interested in, check it out.  Oh, and if you want to see how they did the special effects, check out some of the behind the scenes footage in the special features.  It's actually pretty cool!  Highly recommended!",4,Awesome concept somewhat hampered by low budget...,1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,1826,"['Gamebox', '1.0', 'originally', 'titled', 'Game', 'Over', 'NOT', 'horror', 'movie', 'cover', 'art', 'implies', 'actually', 'very', 'family', 'friendly', 'PG-13', 'sci-fi/action', 'adventure', 'movie', 'involving', 'guy', 'who', 'sucked', 'virtual', 'reality', 'video', 'game', 'where', 'game', 'real', 'life.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '200,000', 'budget', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'considering', 'what', 'final', 'product', 'ended', 'up', 'looking', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'hero', 'Grand', 'Theft', 'Auto-esque', 'virtual', 'world', 'wonderful', 'computer', 'generated', 'background', 'rich', 'detail', 'full', 'eye', 'candy', 'movie', 'shifts', 'gears', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'next', 'two', 'games', 'ZombieLand', 'Alien', 'Planet', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'much', 'less', 'impressive', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'would', 'remake', 'movie', 'movie', 'theater', 'quality', 'budget', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'very', 'quickly', 'interest', 'story', 'fascinating', 'lot', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'recently', 'ending', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'great', 'movie', 'tweenage', 'boys', '8-12', 'especially', 'ones', 'are', 'video', 'games', 'very', 'little', 'swearing', 'violence', 'very', 'toned', 'down', 'such', 'when', 'someone', 'shot', 'video', 'game', 'just', 'small', 'smoking', 'hole', 'shirt', 'blood', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'picky', 'what', '10', '11', 'year', 'olds', 'watch', 'screening', 'had', 'qualms', 'letting', 'see', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'up', 'alley', 'did', 'love', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'remotely', 'interested', 'check', 'out', 'Oh', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'did', 'special', 'effects', 'check', 'out', 'scenes', 'footage', 'special', 'features', 'actually', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Gamebox 1.0

The story seemed like such a unique concept that i was sure it would be something exciting. I was pretty disappointing thou, being that it was direct to video and probably had a small budget, the special effects were pretty lame. The background story was actually pretty good. However, it was buried under cheesy special effects and performed by Sabrina and Boy Meets World outcasts, that are all grown up, so it was hard to tell. After thinking about it a little, I could see where they were going. Overall, it was ok, pretty much just a direct to video version of a failed movie with a similar story line, Stay Alive.
