I read one review that compared his orphanage stay to that of PIXOTE; that couldn't be further from truth. I fact, there is no similarity what so ever. This movie had heros, a good plot, and a rating I would say was just above PG; since the is murder,  kidnapping for slavery, rescue and revenge.",4,i was impressed,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,382,"['have', ""n't"", 'watch', 'while', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'expected', 'like', 'read', 'one', 'review', 'compared', 'orphanage', 'stay', 'PIXOTE', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'fact', 'similarity', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'movie', 'had', 'heros', 'good', 'plot', 'rating', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'just', 'PG', 'murder', 'kidnapping', 'slavery', 'rescue', 'revenge']",N/A

It is a truly magical family film, with excellent performances by the young Alessandro, and his younger brother Marcelo in the flashbacks, as Lazaro. The beauty of Lazaro's innocent life is rudely interupted by the intrusion of Church complicit societal rules of order. This orderliness, including child-prison scenes that remind one of the classic film PIXOTE, although not quite so brutal, are only escaped by a return to the myths of childhood and the mystery of nature. See it with your own youngsters, and talk about it after.

The feral child is a boy or girl who has been orphaned or abandoned in thewilds, jungle, wilderness, or outback.  The will of a youngster to survive is phenomenal in actual case histories discovered in India, France and the deserts of Africa.  But this Movie in a MGM DVD takes place in the Amazon Jungle of South America.  A boy is orphaned upon the death of his Father by a River Anaconda.The orphaned boy is searched for and discovered by a roman Catholic Priest who knew his Father.  He brings the boy back to civilization.  This is an excellent family movie against the backdrop of the Amazon Jungle and daily life in South America, which gives this movie a very close true-to-life atmosphere.

Barros,"[9, 10]","""Where the River Runs Black"" (1986 - 97 minutes), directed by Christopher Cain, is a beautiful adaptation for the cinema of the awarded novel ""Lazaro"", of David Kendall. The film mix religion and mysticism when tells the history of a boy created in the Amazonian forest that is taken to be educated in an orphanage. The tram starts when an American missionary, the idealistic priest Mahoney (the actor Peter Horton) - that works in the region where the waters of the River Amazon becomes black -, knows a mysterious and sensual woman. A child is born of this relation and Mahoney dies. The boy, Lazarus, is played by a 10 years old Brazilian boy, Alessandro Rabelo who carried out the film side by side to the experienced actor Charles Durning (priest O'Reilly). Educated in the forest, Lazarus develops a strange relation with the ""botos"" (dolphins of the Amazon River). Of the wonderful landscapes of the Amazonian forest to the dirty and hard urban scenes, the story of magical realism maintain its attraction due to the delirious photograph of Juan-Ruiz Anchia.
