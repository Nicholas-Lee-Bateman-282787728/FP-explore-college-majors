Yes, a lot of the great stuff is here such as his Matt Foley character, Bennett Brauer, and the Chippendales skit he had with Swayze. It's enough to heighten your appetite for Farley but not enough to fill you. His death was truly a shame.

This is the treasure trove that Chris Farley left us before he passed. The Matt Foley: Motivational Speaker sketch is without a doubt the funniest piece of sketch that I have EVER seen on SNL. Just look at David Spade and Christina Applegate's faces, they cannot stop laughing, it's just that funny. This DVD version does elimate some classic skits such as The Herlihy Boy and Schmitts Gay but the remainder and the extras make this  worth the price of purchase. Among the best are Chippendales Dancer, Da Bears (""I'M NOKING...NOKING!!!), Bennett Brauer's Weekend Update commentary (""maybe the network would be happier with someone who doesn't EAT THEIR OWN DANDRUFF or FRIGHTEN SMALL CHILDREN""), Grandma Sketch w/Sandler & Married Old Couple sketch with Sandler and of course, The Chris Farley Show. The bonus features on this DVD are great too, there are 2 talk show performances, one with Conan O'Brien and one with Jay Leno. I'm convinced that Farley suffered from anxiety/panic disorder because if you watch these interviews you can see that he is so uncomfortable (sweating and clenching his fists) during these interviews. I truly believe if he would have gotten some professional help for his anxiety instead of self medicating he might still be with us today. But anyway, this is some of the funniest sketch comedy ever created and is an absolute must-own for even a casual fan. Highest Recommendation...R.I.P Chris Farley.P.S.
