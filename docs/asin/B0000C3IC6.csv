I was very disappointed, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. I ordered a new set and watch it every chance I get.It is a very interesting documentary about ghosts and hauntings, several based in England. I'm a Patrick Macnee fan and I think he's wonderful in this series.",5,Ghost Stories,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,375,"['sister', 'had', 'given', 'DVD', 'set', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'loaned', 'out', 'never', 'got', 'back', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'find', 'Amazon', 'ordered', 'new', 'set', 'watch', 'chance', 'get.It', 'very', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'ghosts', 'hauntings', 'several', 'based', 'England', ""'m"", 'Patrick', 'Macnee', 'fan', 'think', 'wonderful', 'series']",N/A

You are better off buying Ghost Stories collection which is pretty much the same thing. I guess they put this together for a lower cheaper price.

They are mostly stories told by people who are being interviewed about them. There is not much reenactment.  I bought the boxed set a few years ago and there were 5 DVDs.  There are stories/interviews from the Tower of London, Tombstone, Arizona, ghosts of Hollywood including the tale of the Black Dahlia, the Black Hope Cemetery story from Texas, also a story about a group of school children who were killed on a bus crossing a railroad track in Texas and whose spirits supposedly will push your vehicle across that same track to safety, Moody's Light in Indiana.  These are just a few that I recall off the top of my head.  Each DVD is approximately an hour long.  They're okay to watch on a rainy day/night if you like ghost stories and have nothing better to do.  I have, however, seen better ghost story reenactments and better settings for ghost stories.

It's not the best by any means...but it was entertaining and there are many stories that were interesting.  Not overly scary but that is good if you have kids.  I liked this better then the ""Ghosts and the paranormal"" set I purchased recently because it has a lot of ghost stories.  There are even a few people that make me laugh.  Some of the interviews are just funny.  In particular the woman named Elizabeth on the first disc.  She REALLY made me laugh!!!
