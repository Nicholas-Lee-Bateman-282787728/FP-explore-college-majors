1319748,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B0033A9IPC,I. Giles,"[1, 1]","This is a studio performance as if a concert performance but without audience. The venue is in a modified church affording a pleasant layout and with apparently good acoustics.The performance of the concerto does not aim for virtuoso effects. Words such as considered, thoughtful, mature and even occasionally, balletic spring more readily to mind rather than exciting or thrilling. This finally leads one to a satisfyingly musical experience but not one that will lead you to the edge of your seat or one which would raise an audience to its feet. Instead it would probably receive respectful applause at a concert with accompanying private discussion and debate.Much respected classic performances on CD such as those by Richter, Curzon, Fleisher, Gilels and more recent ones by such as by Kovacevich, Angelich and Friere all show more drive while still providing deep insights in a variety of ways. None of these, in my opinion, are seriously challenged by this release as an interpretation or performance. However, as a visual experience this is still welcome place in my collection as listed above. As is so often the case, there is a truly valuable extra dimension in actually seeing an artist of high calibre at work and that is what we have here.The solo recital, without audience at The Prada Museum, continues in much the same vein with a choice of pieces focusing mainly on those with slow tempi. The approach to these pieces is, once more, reflective rather than bracing - even somewhat muted in total effect. Once again, I would not choose any of these performances as a favourite when there are so many other fine ones to choose from on CD. Yet once again the visual element is helpful, though not so much here, as there is a black blank and silent screen presented between each item and which is damaging to the flow. The items played are Brahms 3 Intermezzi Op 117; Chopin 2 Preludes; Scriabin 2 pieces and Albeniz's El Puerto.There is a documentary bonus in the form of a series of recollections by a number of musical colleagues celebrating Achucarro's career over the last 50 years.All of these pieces are displayed with excellent clarity by HD cameras. The sound format is of equal quality and is presented in PCM 5.1 and stereo. Bearing in mind the strong alternative performances available in enormous quantity on CD I feel that 4 stars is a fairly generous grade for a series of performances which, though generally satisfying, could not be described as anywhere near definitive.",4,Enjoyable but not definitive.

But since it was the only Brahms second concerto I could find on Blu-ray I decided to get it.Well, it turns out, that Achucarro is well-known and, I could tell right away, there is something unique and ingenious about how he interprets and plays piano works.  He even made some Scriabin piano pieces sound scintillating and fascinating to me, which for me is an accomplishment considering that I usually find Scriabin boring.  Some of the piano pieces he played on this recording revealed the pieces in ways I have not heard them before.The Brahms Second concerto was excellently played, and the orchestration was excellent as well.  All of the basic emotive nuances of he pieces were brought out, as well as the overall sense of ""pleading"" that Brahms' frustrated, perhaps somewhat psychotic, personality brings to his music.One criticism is the overall visual settings in which the pieces were played.  The Brahms was recorded in a colorful studio with a modern brick/steel/glass architecture that seemed a bit too light and airy a visual environment for a ""heavy"" Brahms piece replete with exasperation and suffering, which seems better recorded in an ornate concert hall.  Achucarro also played some solo piano pieces in other parts of the disc while the piano was seated next to, of all things, the violent Goya painting ""The Third of May,"" so you could see blood-spattered Spaniards being executed by Napoleon's soldiers in the background.  This also contrasted in a somewhat tacky way with the quiet, contemplative music being played next to it.  In general, these visual settings were a bit of a distraction.",5,excellent brahms and fascinating pianist,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,1768,"['had', 'not', 'heard', 'pianist', 'Achucarro', 'thought', 'Who', 'guy', 'tongue-twister', 'name', 'interpreting', 'Brahms', 'second', 'concerto', 'was', 'only', 'Brahms', 'second', 'concerto', 'could', 'find', 'Blu-ray', 'decided', 'get', 'it.Well', 'out', 'Achucarro', 'well-known', 'could', 'tell', 'right', 'away', 'something', 'unique', 'ingenious', 'how', 'piano', 'works', 'even', 'made', 'Scriabin', 'piano', 'pieces', 'sound', 'scintillating', 'fascinating', 'accomplishment', 'considering', 'usually', 'find', 'Scriabin', 'boring', 'piano', 'played', 'recording', 'revealed', 'pieces', 'ways', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'before.The', 'Brahms', 'Second', 'concerto', 'was', 'excellently', 'played', 'orchestration', 'was', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'basic', 'emotive', 'nuances', 'were', 'brought', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'overall', 'sense', 'pleading', 'Brahms', 'frustrated', 'perhaps', 'somewhat', 'psychotic', 'personality', 'brings', 'music.One', 'criticism', 'overall', 'visual', 'settings', 'pieces', 'were', 'played', 'Brahms', 'was', 'recorded', 'colorful', 'studio', 'modern', 'brick/steel/glass', 'architecture', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'light', 'visual', 'environment', 'heavy', 'Brahms', 'piece', 'replete', 'exasperation', 'suffering', 'better', 'recorded', 'ornate', 'concert', 'hall', 'Achucarro', 'also', 'played', 'solo', 'piano', 'pieces', 'other', 'parts', 'disc', 'piano', 'was', 'seated', 'next', 'things', 'violent', 'Goya', 'painting', 'Third', 'May', 'could', 'see', 'blood-spattered', 'Spaniards', 'being', 'executed', 'Napoleon', 'soldiers', 'background', 'also', 'contrasted', 'somewhat', 'tacky', 'way', 'quiet', 'contemplative', 'music', 'being', 'played', 'general', 'visual', 'settings', 'were', 'bit', 'distraction']",N/A

Make no mistake, Achucarro's musicianship is dazzling: his technique is smooth and melodic; his pedaling superb; the orchestra passionate and responsive to Colin Davis' direction.  Then there is the Blu-ray photography which is brilliantly choreographed in a beautiful setting, the cameras intimately focusing on the instruments shaping the orchestration.  The picture is as clear as I have ever seen, and the audio is crisp and present.  None of that recording buried somewhere in the audience.  This is state of the art!  The bonus features provide a biographical background of Achucarro, who has impressive credentials and then the surprise--a recital including Brahms', Chopin, Scriabin, and others--in a pianistic tour de force.
