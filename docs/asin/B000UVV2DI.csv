I had hoped this solo performance would be enjoyable and it is.Its Mr Hodgson with guitar and keyboards/piano and on some songs he has accompaniment.

There are some extended interviews with Roger that make excellent bonus material.  What's the problem?  Amateurish edition and very poor sync of sound to picture.  Either Roger re-recorded a lot of the material and didn't re-sync the audio or the live audio wasn't synced well with the video edits.

1096995,A3QHIH7C3H81EH,B000UVV2DI,"Lethe ""lor68""","[1, 1]","Roger Hodgson alone represented the whole project by Supertramp and still today! In fact the present DVD- featuring a famous concert recorded in Montreal in 2006- is a typical example regarding his unique style and talent as well..the ideas and the melodic impact of his songs are a ""Roger Hodgson's trademark""; and moreover his versatility (He plays the keyboards, the 12 Strings Guitar and even the harmonica) makes himself like the ""one showman"" by Supertramp. So all these features let us choose the present DVD like a must-have within the AOR/pompous melodic music-genre: think of some ever- green tunes like ""The Logical Song"" or ""Long Way Home"", without forgetting another remarkable song such as ""Dreamer"" and you can understand his value as a strong melodic composer!! Naturally I'm a piano player like him and I'm so happy when He plays the Grand Piano or the Electric Piano with the same naturalness; even though I'm in the habit to have my personal benchmark to measure the skill by Roger (that's the Live In Paris by Supertramp) and sometimes it seems lacking his old approach when He's involved with the choice of the songs selection (actually a difficult and embarassing choice it is)...but it's a minor defect after all, like the omission of a full ""Fool's Overture, cause He's able to create a great feeling and emotion anyway here...perhaps ever!!",4,Roger Hodgson alone represented the whole project by Supertramp!,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,1365,"['Roger', 'Hodgson', 'alone', 'represented', 'whole', 'project', 'Supertramp', 'still', 'today', 'fact', 'present', 'DVD-', 'featuring', 'famous', 'concert', 'recorded', 'Montreal', '2006-', 'typical', 'example', 'regarding', 'unique', 'style', 'talent', 'well..the', 'ideas', 'melodic', 'impact', 'songs', 'are', 'Roger', 'Hodgson', 'trademark', 'moreover', 'versatility', 'keyboards', '12', 'Strings', 'Guitar', 'even', 'harmonica', 'one', 'showman', 'Supertramp', 'So', 'features', 'let', 'choose', 'present', 'DVD', 'must-have', 'AOR/pompous', 'melodic', 'music-genre', 'think', 'ever-', 'green', 'tunes', 'Logical', 'Song', 'Long', 'Way', 'Home', 'forgetting', 'remarkable', 'song', 'such', 'Dreamer', 'can', 'understand', 'value', 'strong', 'melodic', 'composer', 'Naturally', ""'m"", 'piano', 'player', ""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'when', 'Grand', 'Piano', 'Electric', 'Piano', 'same', 'naturalness', 'even', ""'m"", 'habit', 'have', 'personal', 'benchmark', 'measure', 'skill', 'Roger', 'Live', 'Paris', 'Supertramp', 'lacking', 'old', 'approach', 'when', 'involved', 'choice', 'songs', 'selection', 'actually', 'difficult', 'embarassing', 'choice', 'minor', 'defect', 'omission', 'full', 'Fool', 'Overture', 'cause', 'able', 'create', 'great', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'anyway', 'here', 'perhaps', 'ever']",N/A

Only downside of this 2006 - DVD is that 'Live In Montreal' turns out to be a Hodgson solo performance. Had there have been entire band with him - I definitely then would have given this DVD a five-star rating. Still, a fine DVD to watch. Sort of maybe like a PBS special. Many of the unforgettable Supertramp gems are present - like the stunning ""Take The Long Way Home"", ""Give It A Little Bit"", one of my personal favorites ""The Logical Song"", ""Breakfast In America"", the tear-jerker ""It's Raining Again"", the late night FM radio staple ""School"" and ""Dreamer"". I didn't recognize a few of this DVD's tracks immediately. Guess that perhaps I need to dig out my old Supertramp lp's and cassettes (if they still play). I'm thinking that I likely would have gotten just as much out of this title - as a CD release - that is if it is available on audio CD.
