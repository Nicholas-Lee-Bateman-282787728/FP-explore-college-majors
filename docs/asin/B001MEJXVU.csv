1216621,A2L4HGNKU463YE,B001MEJXVU,JAMES PEDERSEN,"[0, 1]","This is a dated piece with everything that goes with an English Murder Mystery of the 30's and 40's: inappropriately upbeat music, overacting, cutesy humor and some silly dialogue.  But the underlying mystery works so I accepted it for what it is. The movie had its moments and was far from a waste of time.  But if you're looking for something comparable to our modern mysteries like &#34;Sherlock&#34; you'll be disappointed. &#34;They don't make them like this anymore&#34; isn't always a bad thing.",3,Not bad for an old one,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,502,"['dated', 'piece', 'everything', 'English', 'Murder', 'Mystery', '30', '40', 'inappropriately', 'upbeat', 'music', 'overacting', 'cutesy', 'humor', 'silly', 'dialogue', 'underlying', 'mystery', 'so', 'accepted', 'what', 'movie', 'had', 'moments', 'was', 'far', 'waste', 'time', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'comparable', 'modern', 'mysteries', '34', 'Sherlock', '34', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', '34', ""n't"", 'always', 'bad', 'thing']",The Case of the Frightened Lady

I love British films and mysteries; I purchased this on a hunch and my hunch paid off.  I've enjoyed it and it's one I pull out and watch again when I'm not interested in the offering on TCM that night. There are some interesting character actors of the British genre in it that you might recognize.  I vote:  Buy it!  It's even better on a cold dark night with a spot of tea laced with a sip of brandy to keep you warm.",4,A Nice Spot of British Mystery,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,521,"['Case', 'Frightened', 'Lady', 'opinion', 'delightful', 'little', 'mystery', 'film', ""'30"", 'love', 'British', 'films', 'mysteries', 'purchased', 'hunch', 'hunch', 'paid', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'one', 'pull', 'out', 'watch', 'again', 'when', ""'m"", 'not', 'interested', 'offering', 'TCM', 'night', 'are', 'interesting', 'character', 'actors', 'British', 'genre', 'might', 'recognize', 'vote', 'Buy', 'even', 'better', 'cold', 'dark', 'night', 'spot', 'tea', 'laced', 'sip', 'brandy', 'keep', 'warm']",The Case of the Frightened Lady

Suffice to say it's a Gothic Murder Mystery with several murders and plot twists that takes place in an old stately English country mansion. Some of the characters are not what they seem and there are hidden secrets to unfold. Overall a very good mystery if you like the type. Don't expect a lot of action, explosions, or graphic violence. However, if sinister surroundings and characters interest you then you'll enjoy this one....surprise ending..!! Overall a good mystery and worth the money.",5,Gothic English Mystery...,1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,562,"['ca', ""n't"", 'adequately', 'review', 'movie', 'giving', 'plot', 'away', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Gothic', 'Murder', 'Mystery', 'several', 'murders', 'plot', 'twists', 'place', 'old', 'stately', 'English', 'country', 'mansion', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'are', 'hidden', 'secrets', 'unfold', 'Overall', 'very', 'good', 'mystery', 'like', 'type', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'action', 'explosions', 'graphic', 'violence', 'However', 'sinister', 'surroundings', 'characters', 'interest', 'then', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'one', '.surprise', 'ending..', 'good', 'mystery', 'money']",The Case of the Frightened Lady
