19897,A225TBSWA7YAPR,0767832302,"ad_crumenam ""ad_crumenam""","[10, 15]","This movie, had it been written and acted better, could have been a classic.  The elements were there.  The plot was there.  Maybe it was the editing...I don't know...but there were moments of sheer brilliance, I promise.  McGowan's Courtney Shane sums up her influence by telling Vylette that ""Courtney Shane is priority 1.""  Shameless!  There should have been more scenes between Foxy and her father (who serenades her with Tiffany's  ""I Think We're Alone Now"") and between everyone and Pam Grier.  All of the actresses were too old to play high-schoolers...I think 22 should be the maximum cut-off age, and these girls are pretty well beyond that, especially Rebecca Gayheart, who if she isn't 30 already is definitely scratching at the door.  They looked silly next to Tatyana Ali, who still looks young enough to play a high schooler.Some parts of the film are ridiculous...how would Courtney's having sex with a man in Elizabeth's bed somehow imply that she was raped if there was no physical evidence on the body?  If she collected his semen and put it there, we certainly didn't see it.  Plus, how did the whole school not realize that Vylette was Fern?  I'm sure the teachers knew.  Why didn't they?  It's ridiculous.Other than that, decent film, some good laughs, great music.

19901,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767832302,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I think that the idea behind `Jawbreaker', no matter how disturbing, is somewhat smart as well.  I really would have liked to see better actresses placed in the film.  I can only imagine how hilarious this movie might have been if say, it starred Denise Richards and Kirsten Dunst (so brilliant together in `Drop Dead Gorgeous').  Instead, we get Rose McGowan who, lets face it, is little more than a pretty face (and here her face isn't all that pretty).The film revolves around a prank gone awry.  Popular girl Courtney and her friends Julie and Marcia kidnap their best friend Elizabeth on her seventeenth birthday, shove a jawbreaker in her mouth, tape it shut and toss her in the trunk.  It's a harmless prank.  They're going to stuff her face with pancakes and pretty much make her miserable to commemorate her birthday.  But that harmless prank turns deadly when that jawbreaker wares down and gets lodged in Liz's throat, and she dies in Courtney's trunk.  The girls panic and Julie wants to tell the police but Courtney is determined not to go to jail for playing a prank so she convinces the girls to help her make it look like Liz was murdered by a strange man.  When the school outcast Fern walks in on the girls Courtney decides to offer her Liz's place in their group if she'll keep her mouth shut.The initial idea (of the whole jawbreaker murder) is quite original.  The route they went was not so much (let's make the nerd popular as long as it benefits the group).  What really kills the film though is McGowan's ridiculous acting; in fact everyone's performances are downright eye-gouging.  The only one who almost scathes by is Rebecca (can't type her last name or my review will get banned); almost.Rose McGowan isn't comfortable with her character, which is odd, and so she tends to appear like someone trying to be cool and popular instead of someone who is cool and popular.  She appears like a wannabe and thus makes her characters `power over others' come off as fake and preposterous.  Julie Benz does nothing more than follow McGowan around like a lapdog, and Judy Greer handles her characters transformation with little more than a passing attempt.  The film has really no use for men so the performances (and cameos) of actors like Ethan Erickson, Chad Christ and even Marilyn Manson are all borderline ridiculous.  Rebecca is the most talented in the bunch and she manages to deliver some sort of saving grace to the film with her conflicted heroine, but even she can't save the film from the evil clutches of McGowan and company.Like I said, the film also takes a very clich&eacute;d approach to the subject matter, an approach that is better left to a Freddie Prince Jr. movie (does he even act anymore), but the fill would have still been watchable had a more convincing villain (I'm telling you, Denise Richards) been cast.",2,This movie will break more than just your jaw...,1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,2857,"['think', 'idea', 'Jawbreaker', 'matter', 'how', 'disturbing', 'somewhat', 'smart', 'well', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'better', 'actresses', 'placed', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'say', 'starred', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'so', 'brilliant', 'together', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'Instead', 'get', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'who', 'face', 'little', 'more', 'pretty', 'face', 'here', 'face', ""n't"", 'pretty', '.The', 'film', 'around', 'prank', 'gone', 'awry', 'Popular', 'girl', 'Courtney', 'friends', 'Julie', 'Marcia', 'kidnap', 'best', 'friend', 'Elizabeth', 'seventeenth', 'birthday', 'shove', 'jawbreaker', 'mouth', 'tape', 'shut', 'trunk', 'harmless', 'prank', ""'re"", 'going', 'stuff', 'face', 'pancakes', 'pretty', 'much', 'make', 'miserable', 'commemorate', 'birthday', 'harmless', 'prank', 'turns', 'deadly', 'when', 'jawbreaker', 'down', 'lodged', 'Liz', 'throat', 'Courtney', 'trunk', 'girls', 'panic', 'Julie', 'tell', 'police', 'Courtney', 'determined', 'not', 'go', 'jail', 'playing', 'prank', 'girls', 'help', 'make', 'look', 'Liz', 'was', 'murdered', 'strange', 'man', 'When', 'school', 'outcast', 'Fern', 'walks', 'girls', 'Courtney', 'offer', 'Liz', 'place', 'group', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut.The', 'initial', 'idea', 'whole', 'jawbreaker', 'murder', 'quite', 'original', 'route', 'went', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'let', 'make', 'nerd', 'popular', 'as', 'long', 'benefits', 'group', 'What', 'really', 'film', 'though', 'McGowan', 'ridiculous', 'acting', 'fact', 'everyone', 'performances', 'are', 'downright', 'eye-gouging', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'almost', 'scathes', 'Rebecca', 'ca', ""n't"", 'type', 'last', 'name', 'review', 'will', 'get', 'banned', 'almost.Rose', 'McGowan', ""n't"", 'comfortable', 'character', 'odd', 'so', 'appear', 'someone', 'trying', 'be', 'cool', 'popular', 'instead', 'someone', 'who', 'cool', 'popular', 'wannabe', 'thus', 'characters', 'power', 'others', 'come', 'off', 'fake', 'preposterous', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'nothing', 'more', 'follow', 'McGowan', 'lapdog', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'characters', 'transformation', 'little', 'more', 'passing', 'attempt', 'film', 'really', 'use', 'men', 'so', 'performances', 'cameos', 'actors', 'Ethan', 'Erickson', 'Chad', 'Christ', 'even', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'are', 'borderline', 'ridiculous', 'Rebecca', 'most', 'talented', 'bunch', 'deliver', 'sort', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'conflicted', 'heroine', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'evil', 'clutches', 'McGowan', 'company.Like', 'said', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'approach', 'subject', 'matter', 'approach', 'better', 'left', 'Freddie', 'Prince', 'Jr.', 'movie', 'even', 'act', 'anymore', 'fill', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'been', 'watchable', 'had', 'more', 'convincing', 'villain', ""'m"", 'telling', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'been', 'cast']",N/A

It has a style and attitude all it's own within the overbearing genre aimed at teenage/20-somethings.Quick Synopsis: The coolest girls in school, ruled by Courtney (the Queen Bee) decide to play a harmless prank on one of their girlfriends, Liz, for her birthday. Sadly, the prank turned tragic when it resulted in Liz's death -- an occurence that was accidentally witnessed by the nerdiest girl in school, Fern Mayo. Now Courtney and company must strike a deal with Fern (they give her a makeover and help her become beautiful and popular...like them) in order to keep her quiet.This film has a dark comedy quality to it, much like the movieHeathers (THX Version)did. The characters have an odd and quirky manner of speaking, and it makes the dialogue somewhat broken and fascinating at the same time. Rose McGowan shines as the 'Satan-in-heels' Courtney Shayne. The wardrobe and filming sequences are captivating (as usual with teen flicks, there are plenty of slow motion hot chicks strutting down the school hallways). The music fits perfectly with each scene, and compliments the edgy attitude of the movie.Still...one can't help but notice that this movie is certainly not Oscar material.

19916,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0767832302,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","I can understand why some people don't particularly like this movie, but I enjoyed it immensely.  Of course, I enjoy anything featuring Rose McGowan, but the movie itself is actually a lot of fun.  If you tend to take movies seriously and have trouble suspending your disbelief, this movie isn't for you, and a short description of the movie should easily convince you to take your cinematic interests elsewhere.  I happen to like over the top movies about high school life, and Jawbreaker takes the stratification of high school society, something we are all acquainted with in one form or another, and runs with it.  Rose McGowan plays Courtney Shane, considered by some to be ""Satan-in-heels.""  She is your ultimate clique queen, operating the controls of high school popularity and approachability with the help of faithful and reliable henchbabe Marcie Fox (Julie Benz) and two goody-goodies who somehow manage to stay cool despite hobnobbing with their social inferiors from time to time.  Rebecca Gayheart (who finds herself in the odd situation of being rather invisible whenever McGowan shares the screen with her) plays Julie Freedman, and she is in fact complicit in the unusual death of Elizabeth Purr, sweet little angel and fourth member of the ruling babes of Reagan High School.  Courtney, Marcie, and Julie celebrate Liz's 17th birthday by disguising themselves, sneaking into her room, tying her up and gagging her, throwing her into the trunk of their car, and eventually releasing her to enjoy the hilarity of their innocent little prank.  Wouldn't you know it, something goes awry.  The insanely large jawbreaker that Courtney stuffs in her mouth before taping it closed manages to work its way down Liz's throat.  With their friend dead, the three girls must take action quickly to avoid detection; Courtney is a natural at evil plotting and quickly enacts a plan.  Unfortunately, class geek Fern Mayo happens along and overhears the big secret, prompting Courtney to take drastic action; in return for Fern's silence, she will transform Fern into the beautiful, popular girl she has always wanted to be.  Julie wants no part of it, but her own guilt and complicity leads her to do little more than go schoolmarm and reject her evil friends.This movie does raise issues about high school life, but it does not attempt to make some meaningful statement .  The common stereotypes are presented but not dwelt on.  Those who would not understand how nice, sweet Fern could be enticed into going over to the dark side were obviously not among the nerds and geeks of their own graduating class.  Even though Courtney was hated as much as she was loved, the vast majority of her peers wanted to be like her, immensely popular, beautiful, intimidating, and awe-inspiring.  Sure, she is selfish, evil, and uncaring, but that's part of her charm.  I personally prefer her to Julie, who pretends to be something she is not and blames Courtney alone for an act she herself played a large part in.Don't even try to think about this movie; you're not supposed to learn anything here.  This is entertainment and nothing more, and I for one was greatly entertained.  The ending leaves a little something to be desired, but all in all this is a marvelous dark comedy.  Rose McGowan makes this movie cool all by herself, but the kicking soundtrack is more than ready to assist in this endeavor whenever called upon, which is quite often.  The music is almost a character in and of itself, beautifully assisting in the creation of whatever atmosphere is required for each scene, and its incessant energy never allows for a moment of drag as the story works itself out.  There is quite a bit of profanity in the script, and it is this much more than Rose McGowan's all-too-brief yet sizzling nude scene that earns this one its R rating.  I seem to take delight in praising movies of this type, and I take great delight in praising this one.

This movie has tone problems and the underlying themes have jumped the rail and are all over the infield. This is a dark comedy about a cliquish group of four high school girls who think they control their school.  They say dark comedy is hard to do because the director is trying to make humor out of something that is not usually funny.  Well this movie goes the hard way.  A pretty young girl bound and gagged, who suffocates on a jawbreaker crammed down her throat while her mouth is sealed by duct tape.  I don't see the dark humor.  If she'd lived and gone on to some dark practical jokes that could have been material for dark humor.  I have seen death kidded in many movies, but some character development showing the light side might precede.  You know, some comedy to set the mood for laughing before the dark bomb.  The victim is just a pretty young girl who has done nothing we know of.  Even the actresses don't seem to know how to act in this movie so they act half cheerful and half grief stricken at the same time.  Rose McGowan(Courtney)is an controlling leader who tries to run things.  Rose tries to hold up the sinking film with assertiveness, dominance and clothes that complement her figure, but even Rose spends half the film scowling without a trace of humor.  Excuse me, dark humor. Rose's character Courtney is guilty of manslaughter and it bleeds tragedy into every thing she does.  Courtney is a nice looking little meany, but here she is tainted through and through.  There just isn't an outline for funny: anywhere! To ease up a bit, it's just a dark comedy that misses a fast ball.  It just needs an overhaul, lube job, and dark comedian.

19932,ABFJYHVD8RHLE,0767832302,Hillary,"[0, 0]","This eye-catching Darren Stein teen satire caught MY eye several times while flipping channels, but I'd never caught the film from the beginning.  Finally, I watched it from beginning to end,  and I enjoyed it so much, I watched it again.Rose McGowan plays Courtney Shayne, a viciously hateful head of a 4 girl highschool clique.  All four are beautiful, stylish, spoiled and naturally, cool with  capital ""C"".  There's cohort Julie Benz as Marcy Fox aka ""Foxy""  (her neckplate states), she is a stereotypic ""dumb blonde"" unquestionably following Courtney's rules.  Rebecca Gayheart plays Julie Freedman.  She's a wholesome, sweet girl looking for fun, and friendship.The movie opens fabulously as the three girls  disguise themselves, and break into their friends bedroom on her birthday.  They figure they'll ""Feed her pancakes, and strip her... (ect.)"", and they'll all have fun giving her an unexpected surprise.  We come upon the unusual title of the film, when Courtney brutally stuffs a ""Jawbreaker"" golfball size candy into her mouth and then duct tapes it shut.  The three then throw her in the trunk of the car.  When they arrive at their destination, the trunk opens again, to reveal a far bigger suprise than the one they planned. Their friend is suffocated, eyes wide, dismayed, and unmistakably dead.  All this in the first 5 minutes!!The three girls react in totally different ways.  ""Foxy"" freaks, Julie wants to tell someone and get help, and Courtney, being the leader, decides coldly and calculatingly to cover it all up.  They take the friends body back home to the bed where they kidnapped her from, and try to make it look like murder.  While the three argue about what to do, into the house walks nerd Fern Mayo (Judy Greer).  While delivering homework to the now dead classmate she has secretly idolized, she overhears what happened, and see's the body.  To shut her up, Courtney offers her a makeover, a new identity, and passport to chic and cool to rule the school.  From a pact with the devilish Courtney, ""Violet"" is born.  After all, Fern is a Plant, so Violet is a Flower, according to Courtney's logic.  Violet, now the new mysteriously cool chick everyone wants to know better, comes to overshadow Courtney's established cool rule, and all the more deliciously bitchy trouble begins.This movie is a true masterpiece in the teen genre realm.  It touches on similar ground with ""Heathers"" as well as Keanu Reeves early effort ""River's Edge.""  It's not laugh out loud hilarious, but it is most definitely, a black satire.  There are amusing cameos from Carol Kane as a slightly indignant teacher, and speaking of ""Foxy"", the old 1970s ""Foxy Brown"", Pam Grier is terrifically dour and surly as a detective hilariously named Vera Cruz.Besides the highly amusing and watchable cast, the film is such a visually attractive treat as well.  The vividly sharp candy colors, and frequently surrealistic moods and moments in the cinematography, create even more of an offbeat and quirky feel, than the plot alone delivers.All this and an outstanding soundtrack with the perfect song for every scene (the slow motion school hallway saunter of the three leads to ""Yoo-Hoo"" from Imperial Teen is my favorite) further takes this up yet ANOTHER notch,  making ""Jawbreaker"" a must see, as well as a must hear!",5,Reality Does NOT bite!,1020297600,"05 2, 2002",2002,3324,"['eye-catching', 'Darren', 'Stein', 'teen', 'satire', 'caught', 'MY', 'eye', 'several', 'times', 'flipping', 'channels', ""'d"", 'never', 'caught', 'film', 'beginning', 'Finally', 'watched', 'beginning', 'end', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'watched', 'again.Rose', 'McGowan', 'Courtney', 'Shayne', 'viciously', 'hateful', 'head', '4', 'girl', 'highschool', 'clique', 'four', 'are', 'beautiful', 'stylish', 'spoiled', 'naturally', 'cool', 'capital', 'C', 'cohort', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'Marcy', 'Fox', 'Foxy', 'neckplate', 'states', 'stereotypic', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'unquestionably', 'following', 'Courtney', 'rules', 'Rebecca', 'Gayheart', 'Julie', 'Freedman', 'wholesome', 'sweet', 'girl', 'looking', 'fun', 'friendship.The', 'movie', 'fabulously', 'three', 'girls', 'disguise', 'break', 'friends', 'bedroom', 'birthday', 'figure', ""'ll"", 'Feed', 'pancakes', 'strip', 'ect', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun', 'giving', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'come', 'unusual', 'title', 'film', 'when', 'Courtney', 'brutally', 'Jawbreaker', 'golfball', 'size', 'candy', 'mouth', 'then', 'duct', 'tapes', 'shut', 'three', 'then', 'throw', 'trunk', 'car', 'When', 'arrive', 'destination', 'trunk', 'again', 'reveal', 'far', 'bigger', 'suprise', 'one', 'planned', 'friend', 'suffocated', 'eyes', 'wide', 'dismayed', 'unmistakably', 'dead', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'three', 'girls', 'react', 'totally', 'different', 'ways', 'Foxy', 'freaks', 'Julie', 'tell', 'someone', 'get', 'help', 'Courtney', 'being', 'leader', 'coldly', 'calculatingly', 'cover', 'up', 'take', 'friends', 'body', 'back', 'home', 'bed', 'where', 'kidnapped', 'try', 'make', 'look', 'murder', 'three', 'argue', 'what', 'do', 'house', 'nerd', 'Fern', 'Mayo', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'delivering', 'homework', 'now', 'dead', 'classmate', 'secretly', 'idolized', 'what', 'happened', 'see', 'body', 'shut', 'up', 'Courtney', 'makeover', 'new', 'identity', 'passport', 'chic', 'cool', 'rule', 'school', 'pact', 'devilish', 'Courtney', 'Violet', 'born', 'Fern', 'Plant', 'so', 'Violet', 'Flower', 'according', 'Courtney', 'logic', 'Violet', 'now', 'new', 'mysteriously', 'cool', 'chick', 'everyone', 'know', 'better', 'overshadow', 'Courtney', 'established', 'cool', 'rule', 'more', 'deliciously', 'bitchy', 'trouble', 'begins.This', 'movie', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'teen', 'genre', 'realm', 'similar', 'ground', 'Heathers', 'as', 'well', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'early', 'effort', 'River', 'Edge', 'not', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'hilarious', 'most', 'definitely', 'black', 'satire', 'are', 'amusing', 'cameos', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'slightly', 'indignant', 'teacher', 'speaking', 'Foxy', 'old', '1970s', 'Foxy', 'Brown', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'terrifically', 'dour', 'surly', 'detective', 'hilariously', 'named', 'Vera', 'Cruz.Besides', 'highly', 'amusing', 'watchable', 'cast', 'film', 'visually', 'attractive', 'treat', 'as', 'well', 'vividly', 'sharp', 'candy', 'colors', 'frequently', 'surrealistic', 'moods', 'moments', 'cinematography', 'create', 'even', 'more', 'offbeat', 'quirky', 'feel', 'plot', 'alone', 'outstanding', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'song', 'scene', 'slow', 'motion', 'school', 'hallway', 'saunter', 'three', 'leads', 'Yoo-Hoo', 'Imperial', 'Teen', 'favorite', 'further', 'up', 'yet', 'ANOTHER', 'notch', 'making', 'Jawbreaker', 'must', 'see', 'as', 'well', 'must', 'hear']",N/A

They spend the entire movie trying to cover  up her death and play it off as a murder. Unfortunately, the school geek,  Fern, has seen the body and knows who really killed Liz. So Courtney ( Rose  McGowan ) makes a deal with Fern that she can't refuse: If Fern keeps her  trap shut, then Courtney will make her popular. ( Fern changes her name to  Violett after becoming popular )If only they would have stuck to that  basic plotline, then the story would have been more solid..The movie had  a lot of holes and loose ends left, and just some downright ridiculous  parts, for example: when Fern/Vilett is &quot;dancing&quot; on the hood of  her brand new red convertible while surrounded by a gawking crowd... need I  say more? And the cheesy &quot; You're never going to get away with  this..&quot; lines just need to go. I felt like I was watching a bitchy  scooby doo flick at times..BUT... the movie has its redeeming  qualities.For instance, I personally think that Rose McGowan plays her  character Courtney beautifully. ( If you could call it that.. ). I always  admire someone who can really pull of playing a bad guy in a flick, and she  really can.  Of course, as the movie progresses, her character does get a  little hokey.The supporting characters were good, but they really didn't  help the plotline all that much.But bringing Marilyn Manson into the  film, who can be seen here without all of the gruesome stage makeup, was  really a neat twist, seeing as he and McGowan were or still are dating.

19944,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0767832302,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","&quot;Jawbreaker&quot; begins with the accidental death of Liz Purr (Charlotte Ayanna) as the result of an encounter with the titular confection.  That act is the hook for a young audience to watch this 1999 black comedy but it is really just an excuse for yet another rather lackluster version of the movie where the elite young girls at a high school savage each other (i.e., &quot;Mean Girls&quot; without Tina Fey's wit).  The problem with this movie for most people is going to be that it is going to strike them as a case of bait and switch.  You think this movie is going to be something along the lines of &quot;Scream&quot; or &quot;Carrie&quot; and it is really more like &quot;She's All That&quot; and &quot;Can't Hardly Wait.&quot;The accidental death sets up three plots lines.  First, Queen &quot;B&quot; Courtney Alice Shayne (Rose McGowan) is on a mission to make sure that nothing happens to her position atop the school hierarchy.  Second, good girl Julie Freeman (Rebecca Gayheart) feels badly about killing their best friend and rethinks her membership in the elite group.  Third, wallflower Fern Mayo (Judy Greer) is transformed by Courtney into the vivacious Vylette, who gets to replace Liz.  There is a fourth member of the group, Marcie &quot;Foxy&quot; Fox (Julie Benz), but she is Courtney's loyal stooge and is incapable of independent thought.  Meanwhile, Detective Vera Cruz (Pam Grier) is investigating Liz's death and is questioning the girls.The character of the detective is a pivotal one in the film because she reveals the flaws of this film.  I mean, come on, we are talking about Pam Grier playing a hard-nosed detective, and she gets taken for a ride by a bunch of teenage girls who do not break a sweat.  There is some confusion as to circumstances of Liz's death, thanks to Courtney's efforts, but the disturbing fact that somebody called the school pretending to be Liz's mother to explain she would be home &quot;sick&quot; seems to get forgotten by the time the police haul in a suspect.  These are not the brightest kids to begin with and their effort to cover up their crime only works because in the end this drama has to be played out at the high school prom and not in some precinct house or juvenile court.McGowan was nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for this film and she has a fine time being the cold-hearted queen of the school the story requires.  But the more over the top she goes in terms of being so nasty to those she demands bow down before her that you end up wondering what is wrong with them rather than with Courtney.  Gayheart does a good job of playing her uncomfortableness with what is going on, thereby grounding the movie from time to time in something resembling reality, while Benz vacillates between frightened fool and sarcastic sidekick.  The cast and the performances are good, but not good enough to cover the problems with the basic story and in the end &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; does not finish as strongly as it started.",3,&quot;Jawbreaker&quot; has a good hook but then bait &amp; switches on us,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,3015,"['quot', 'Jawbreaker', 'quot', 'accidental', 'death', 'Liz', 'Purr', 'Charlotte', 'Ayanna', 'result', 'encounter', 'titular', 'confection', 'act', 'hook', 'young', 'audience', 'watch', '1999', 'black', 'comedy', 'really', 'just', 'excuse', 'yet', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'version', 'movie', 'where', 'elite', 'young', 'girls', 'high', 'school', 'savage', 'other', 'i.e.', 'quot', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'quot', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'wit', 'problem', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'going', 'be', 'going', 'strike', 'case', 'bait', 'switch', 'think', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'something', 'lines', 'quot', 'Scream', 'quot', 'quot', 'Carrie', 'quot', 'really', 'more', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait.', 'quot', 'accidental', 'death', 'sets', 'up', 'three', 'plots', 'lines', 'First', 'Queen', 'quot', 'B', 'quot', 'Courtney', 'Alice', 'Shayne', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'mission', 'make', 'sure', 'nothing', 'position', 'school', 'hierarchy', 'Second', 'good', 'girl', 'Julie', 'Freeman', 'Rebecca', 'Gayheart', 'badly', 'killing', 'best', 'friend', 'membership', 'elite', 'group', 'Third', 'wallflower', 'Fern', 'Mayo', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'transformed', 'Courtney', 'vivacious', 'Vylette', 'who', 'replace', 'Liz', 'fourth', 'member', 'group', 'Marcie', 'quot', 'Foxy', 'quot', 'Fox', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'Courtney', 'loyal', 'stooge', 'incapable', 'independent', 'thought', 'Meanwhile', 'Detective', 'Vera', 'Cruz', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'investigating', 'Liz', 'death', 'questioning', 'girls.The', 'character', 'detective', 'pivotal', 'one', 'film', 'flaws', 'film', 'mean', 'come', 'are', 'talking', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'playing', 'hard-nosed', 'detective', 'taken', 'ride', 'bunch', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'break', 'sweat', 'confusion', 'circumstances', 'Liz', 'death', 'thanks', 'Courtney', 'efforts', 'disturbing', 'fact', 'somebody', 'called', 'school', 'pretending', 'be', 'Liz', 'mother', 'explain', 'would', 'be', 'home', 'quot', 'sick', 'quot', 'get', 'forgotten', 'time', 'police', 'haul', 'suspect', 'are', 'not', 'brightest', 'kids', 'begin', 'effort', 'cover', 'up', 'crime', 'only', 'end', 'drama', 'be', 'played', 'out', 'high', 'school', 'prom', 'not', 'precinct', 'house', 'juvenile', 'court.McGowan', 'was', 'nominated', 'MTV', 'Movie', 'Award', 'Best', 'Villain', 'film', 'fine', 'time', 'being', 'cold-hearted', 'queen', 'school', 'story', 'more', 'top', 'terms', 'being', 'so', 'nasty', 'bow', 'down', 'end', 'up', 'wondering', 'what', 'wrong', 'rather', 'Courtney', 'Gayheart', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'uncomfortableness', 'what', 'going', 'thereby', 'grounding', 'movie', 'time', 'time', 'something', 'resembling', 'reality', 'Benz', 'frightened', 'fool', 'sarcastic', 'sidekick', 'cast', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'cover', 'problems', 'basic', 'story', 'end', 'quot', 'Jawbreaker', 'quot', 'not', 'finish', 'as', 'strongly', 'started']",N/A

19949,A152C8GYY25HAH,0767832302,Matthew Horner,"[1, 3]","For years, I have been hoping for a breakthrough movie about teenagers. Jawbreaker is not that movie. It tries hard to be hip, funny and satirical. Perhaps it tries too hard. This is not to say there are not some good moments in it, but, like most recent entries in this genre, it winds up trashing the audience it is aimed at. This trend, I believe, is at the core of what's wrong with a lot of movies today. More on that later.Once again we have a high school ruled by a group of tyrannical brats, in this case three girls. [The school, by the way, looks like the ones in every other picture. In Movieland, no schools have been constructed since the end of W.W.II.] In the opening scene, we see Courtney [Rose McGowan], Julie [Rebecca Gayheart] and Marcie [Julie Benz] playing a prank of one of their girlfriends. Wearing masks, they break into her bedroom, tie her up and throw her in the trunk of a car. The idea is to publicly humiliate her. Courtney thought it would be efficient to gag the victim with a jawbreaker, and when they open the trunk, they find their friend has suffocated.Gruesome as this sounds, many successful comedies have been based on similar events, dating back at least as far as Arsenic and Old Lace in the 1940s. Writer and director Darren Stein, though, does not have the deft, whimsical touch such plot devices require. His lead characters are not bizarre or dizzy, they are simple mean and aggressive. One girl does find a problem with the crime and the attempts to cover it up. Yet it takes her forever to take affirmative action, probably because the movie's theme seems to be that some people will go to any lengths to be popular. When the homely, awkward Fern [Judy Greer] accidentally finds the girls out, Courtney's solution is to offer to transform Fern into someone just like herself. Fern jumps at the chance.I am not one of those who blames society's perceived anguish over today's teens on sex, violence and alienation in movies and on TV. Way back in 1955, James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo played truly troubled young people in Rebel Without a Cause. In 1976, audiences flocked to Carrie, in which a tormented teen with psychic powers got revenge by trying to kill all her classmates at the prom. We delighted at the antics of the sex and drug crazed kids in 1982's Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and we related to an alienated kid in the much praised Heathers [1989], whose solution to his girl friend's troubles was to kill everyone who made her life hell. These subject matters are nothing new, and this list does not include all those gruesome smash hit horror movies.The difference today, as I mentioned at the beginning, is how lowly the characters are. Every other word they speak is a profanity. If nothing else, this would eliminate a chance for a good script. The teenagers are shallow, they are relentlessly materialistic, and they have zero capacity to think for themselves. While I do know young people who act that way, they are a small minority of the ones I know. The rest may be trendy and a bit obsessed with rebellion, like prior generations, but underneath, they are just as bright and worthwhile as their parents and grandparents were. The way teenagers are represented in entertainment today can have no effect other than lowering their self-esteem, which, in turn can lead to all sorts of problems.",2,"Teen movie tries hard, but doens't succeed",1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,3370,"['years', 'have', 'been', 'hoping', 'breakthrough', 'movie', 'teenagers', 'Jawbreaker', 'not', 'movie', 'hard', 'be', 'hip', 'funny', 'satirical', 'Perhaps', 'too', 'hard', 'not', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'moments', 'most', 'recent', 'entries', 'genre', 'up', 'trashing', 'audience', 'aimed', 'trend', 'believe', 'core', 'what', 'wrong', 'lot', 'movies', 'today', 'More', 'later.Once', 'again', 'have', 'high', 'school', 'ruled', 'group', 'tyrannical', 'brats', 'case', 'three', 'girls', '[', 'school', 'way', 'ones', 'other', 'picture', 'Movieland', 'schools', 'have', 'been', 'constructed', 'end', 'W.W.II', ']', 'opening', 'scene', 'see', 'Courtney', '[', 'Rose', 'McGowan', ']', 'Julie', '[', 'Rebecca', 'Gayheart', ']', 'Marcie', '[', 'Julie', 'Benz', ']', 'playing', 'prank', 'one', 'girlfriends', 'Wearing', 'masks', 'break', 'bedroom', 'tie', 'up', 'throw', 'trunk', 'car', 'idea', 'publicly', 'humiliate', 'Courtney', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'efficient', 'gag', 'victim', 'jawbreaker', 'when', 'open', 'trunk', 'find', 'friend', 'suffocated.Gruesome', 'many', 'successful', 'comedies', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'similar', 'events', 'dating', 'back', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'Arsenic', 'Old', 'Lace', '1940s', 'Writer', 'director', 'Darren', 'Stein', 'though', 'not', 'have', 'deft', 'whimsical', 'touch', 'such', 'plot', 'devices', 'require', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'bizarre', 'dizzy', 'are', 'simple', 'mean', 'aggressive', 'One', 'girl', 'find', 'problem', 'crime', 'attempts', 'cover', 'up', 'forever', 'take', 'affirmative', 'action', 'probably', 'movie', 'theme', 'be', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'lengths', 'be', 'popular', 'When', 'homely', 'awkward', 'Fern', '[', 'Judy', 'Greer', ']', 'accidentally', 'girls', 'out', 'Courtney', 'solution', 'offer', 'transform', 'Fern', 'someone', 'just', 'Fern', 'jumps', 'chance.I', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'blames', 'society', 'perceived', 'anguish', 'today', 'teens', 'sex', 'violence', 'alienation', 'movies', 'TV', 'Way', 'back', '1955', 'James', 'Dean', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'played', 'truly', 'troubled', 'young', 'people', 'Rebel', 'Cause', '1976', 'audiences', 'flocked', 'Carrie', 'tormented', 'teen', 'psychic', 'powers', 'got', 'revenge', 'trying', 'kill', 'classmates', 'prom', 'delighted', 'antics', 'sex', 'drug', 'crazed', 'kids', '1982', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'related', 'alienated', 'kid', 'much', 'praised', 'Heathers', '[', '1989', ']', 'solution', 'girl', 'friend', 'troubles', 'was', 'kill', 'everyone', 'who', 'made', 'life', 'hell', 'subject', 'matters', 'are', 'nothing', 'new', 'list', 'not', 'include', 'gruesome', 'smash', 'hit', 'horror', 'movies.The', 'difference', 'today', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'how', 'lowly', 'characters', 'are', 'Every', 'other', 'word', 'speak', 'profanity', 'nothing', 'else', 'would', 'eliminate', 'chance', 'good', 'script', 'teenagers', 'are', 'shallow', 'are', 'relentlessly', 'materialistic', 'have', 'zero', 'capacity', 'think', 'do', 'know', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'act', 'way', 'are', 'small', 'minority', 'ones', 'know', 'rest', 'may', 'be', 'trendy', 'bit', 'obsessed', 'rebellion', 'prior', 'generations', 'underneath', 'are', 'just', 'bright', 'worthwhile', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'were', 'way', 'teenagers', 'are', 'represented', 'entertainment', 'today', 'can', 'have', 'effect', 'other', 'lowering', 'self-esteem', 'turn', 'can', 'lead', 'sorts', 'problems']",N/A

19952,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,0767832302,Michael Butts,"[2, 2]","There's a demonic undertone to this black comedy that delineates the cruelty of teenagers; and also, their lack of self-understanding, and their commitment to only please themselves.  For instance, the scene where hunky Ethan Erickson is waiting for his beloved Rose McGowan to arrive, he tries several different poses on the bed; resorts to stripping to his underwear, and then when she arrives, she baits him with a popsicle.  You can tell he's uncomfortable in licking the popsicle, but you can also see the delight in McGowan's eyes in making him suck the popsicle. When she uses this to bait him as to what he would like done, we can see the cruelty in McGowan's character.The idea of having someone die from choking on a humongous jawbreaker is original, but at the same time, the coolness and nonchalance the girls display in their friend's death is frighteningly realistic ... to a point.  Not one to bash teenagers, we do need them after all?, the movie still makes us see all the things we hated about high school.While McGowan is excellent in her bitch queen role, her destruction at the prom is almost as devastating as Carrie's in the well known horror book/flick.  Rebecca Gayheart as the tried and true Julie sinks to McGowan's level in this destruction.  Julie Benz is appropriately ditzy as Foxy and Judy Greer as Fern Mayo/Vylette also well cast.  Erickson is a perfect choice for the self-absorbed and hedonistic Dane.  Chad Christ as Julie's dramatic boyfriend does well, and once again shows how in high school, if you are a drama freak, you're probably homosexual.The movie falls apart in several places, but does have some good cameos from Pam Grier as Det. Vera Cruz; Jeff Conaway as Foxy's dad, who does a cute Tiffany impersonation; and wastes William Katt and PJ Soles as the victim's parents.  (Ironic, they both appeared in the original CARRIE).Not a classic, but does pack some punch in what it's trying to say, it's just afraid to come out and say it:  teenagers are cruel.",4,EYE CANDY,1089244800,"07 8, 2004",2004,2004,"['demonic', 'undertone', 'black', 'comedy', 'cruelty', 'teenagers', 'also', 'lack', 'self-understanding', 'commitment', 'only', 'please', 'instance', 'scene', 'where', 'hunky', 'Ethan', 'Erickson', 'waiting', 'beloved', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'arrive', 'several', 'different', 'poses', 'bed', 'resorts', 'stripping', 'underwear', 'then', 'when', 'popsicle', 'can', 'tell', 'uncomfortable', 'licking', 'popsicle', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'delight', 'McGowan', 'eyes', 'making', 'suck', 'popsicle', 'When', 'bait', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'done', 'can', 'see', 'cruelty', 'McGowan', 'character.The', 'idea', 'having', 'someone', 'die', 'choking', 'humongous', 'jawbreaker', 'original', 'same', 'time', 'coolness', 'nonchalance', 'girls', 'display', 'friend', 'death', 'frighteningly', 'realistic', 'point', 'Not', 'one', 'bash', 'teenagers', 'do', 'need', 'movie', 'still', 'see', 'things', 'hated', 'about', 'high', 'school.While', 'McGowan', 'excellent', 'bitch', 'queen', 'role', 'destruction', 'prom', 'almost', 'as', 'devastating', 'Carrie', 'well', 'known', 'horror', 'book/flick', 'Rebecca', 'Gayheart', 'tried', 'true', 'Julie', 'sinks', 'McGowan', 'level', 'destruction', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'appropriately', 'ditzy', 'Foxy', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Fern', 'Mayo/Vylette', 'also', 'well', 'cast', 'Erickson', 'perfect', 'choice', 'self-absorbed', 'hedonistic', 'Dane', 'Chad', 'Christ', 'Julie', 'dramatic', 'boyfriend', 'well', 'once', 'again', 'how', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'drama', 'freak', ""'re"", 'probably', 'homosexual.The', 'movie', 'apart', 'several', 'places', 'have', 'good', 'cameos', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'Det', 'Vera', 'Cruz', 'Jeff', 'Conaway', 'Foxy', 'dad', 'who', 'cute', 'Tiffany', 'impersonation', 'William', 'Katt', 'PJ', 'Soles', 'victim', 'parents', 'Ironic', 'appeared', 'original', 'CARRIE', 'classic', 'pack', 'punch', 'what', 'trying', 'say', 'just', 'afraid', 'come', 'out', 'say', 'teenagers', 'are', 'cruel']",N/A

I was laughing, found a new catch phrase to use, and I thought Rose was awesome as the Evil B!tch...she alone is reason enough to rent or buy this dvd, she just seduces you in with her evilness (and the lipstick she wears, can't avoid those bright lips) and coolness about her evilness as if, nothings wrong, it's all f'n Peachy Keen. And that's what this movie is...F'n peachy keen...not F'n awesome (like heathers) but f'n peachy keen.",4,This is no Heathers...BUT....it's f'n peachy keen,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,883,"['Let', 'just', 'get', 'out', 'table', 'here', 'one', 'can', 're-make', 'mimic', 'Heathers', 'Heathers', 'original', 'black', 'comedy', 'teen', 'angst', 'bs', 'movie', 'Heathers', 'queen', 'bee', 'teen', 'cruelty', 'movies', 'own', 'movies', 'Heathers', 'Jawbreaker', 'carrie', 'etc', 'sucker', 'kinds', 'movies', 'lol', 'anyways', 'Alot', 'people', 'already', 'explained', 'plot', 'Jawbreaker', ""'ll"", 'just', 'skip', 'movie', ""n't"", 'brillant', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'laughing', 'found', 'new', 'catch', 'phrase', 'use', 'thought', 'Rose', 'was', 'awesome', 'Evil', 'B', 'tch', 'alone', 'reason', 'enough', 'rent', 'buy', 'dvd', 'just', 'seduces', 'evilness', 'lipstick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'bright', 'lips', 'coolness', 'evilness', 'nothings', 'wrong', 'f', 'n', 'Peachy', 'Keen', 'what', 'movie', 'F', 'n', 'peachy', 'keen', 'not', 'F', 'n', 'awesome', 'heathers', 'n', 'peachy', 'keen']",N/A

As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch ""Clueless"" and ""The Craft"" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the ""entertainment"" piece was dropped and I was just left with ""mindless.""",1,Just Say No,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,858,"['movie', 'Heathers', 'not', 'even', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'As', 'hard', 'tried', 'be', 'witty', 'shocking', 'dark', 'satirical', 'just', 'made', 'want', 'bang', 'head', 'wall', 'make', 'pain', 'watching', 'stop', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'too', 'old', 'drivel', 'could', 'watch', 'Clueless', 'Craft', 'DVD', 'player', 'breaks', 'entertainment', 'value', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'push', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'sad', 'say', 'when', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedic', 'actresses', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'elicit', 'smile', 'plot', 'was', 'full', 'holes', 'writing', 'seemed', 'very', 'rushed', 'contrived', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'greatness', 'when', 'watched', 'Jawbreakers', 'was', 'least', 'hoping', '1', '1/2', 'hours', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'Unfortunately', 'entertainment', 'piece', 'was', 'dropped', 'was', 'just', 'left', 'mindless']",N/A

They would rate in the PG-13 area at most. The soundtrack for Jawbreaker is a good sampling of teenbeat featuring the Donnas.Nor are they at all romantic. Neither film has any kind of healthy love interest for Rose; and the romance between the couple who team up to stop Rose is a very offhand device without chemistry.For me, these are curiosities of interest based on Rose's role in Charmed.
