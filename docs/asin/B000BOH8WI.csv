946671,AHNNSD2R9AL3P,B000BOH8WI,Aly-oops!,"[61, 61]","Tommy (Darius McCrary of ""Family Matters"") is desperate to find a job, but no one wants to hire an ex-con. With no family & the only opportunity facing him being that of a drug runner, life doesn't look too promising. Then he meets Memaw (Irma P. Hall), a kind, elderly woman who hears Tommy's beautiful singing voice in the grocery store. What follows is a pleasant tale of how showing God's love can change even the hardest of hearts and that everyone needs a second chance. Also features Tamera Mowry (from ""Sister, Sister"") as Lily.My husband & I have been looking for good Christian movies to show our youth group, & this definitely falls into that category. The script is well-written & realistic, the acting is excellent (who knew Darius McCrary could sing???), & the story never loses sight of it's goal...love changes people.This movie will leave a smile on your face & your heart singing. If you're looking for a Christian movie without the B-acting & poor action scenes, this one fits the bill. No heavy end-times theme or confusing plot twists, this movie banks on the simple but life-changing truth of God's love.",5,Excellent Christian Movie,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,1126,"['Tommy', 'Darius', 'McCrary', 'Family', 'Matters', 'desperate', 'find', 'job', 'one', 'hire', 'ex-con', 'family', 'only', 'opportunity', 'facing', 'being', 'drug', 'runner', 'life', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'promising', 'Then', 'Memaw', 'Irma', 'P.', 'Hall', 'kind', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'Tommy', 'beautiful', 'singing', 'voice', 'grocery', 'store', 'What', 'pleasant', 'tale', 'how', 'showing', 'God', 'love', 'can', 'change', 'even', 'hardest', 'hearts', 'everyone', 'second', 'chance', 'Also', 'Tamera', 'Mowry', 'Sister', 'Sister', 'Lily.My', 'husband', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'good', 'Christian', 'movies', 'show', 'youth', 'group', 'definitely', 'category', 'script', 'well-written', 'realistic', 'acting', 'excellent', 'who', 'knew', 'Darius', 'McCrary', 'could', 'sing', 'story', 'never', 'sight', 'goal', 'love', 'changes', 'people.This', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'smile', 'face', 'heart', 'singing', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Christian', 'movie', 'B-acting', 'poor', 'action', 'scenes', 'one', 'bill', 'heavy', 'end-times', 'theme', 'confusing', 'plot', 'twists', 'movie', 'banks', 'simple', 'life-changing', 'truth', 'God', 'love']",Billy Graham Presents -  Something to Sing About

He came for the familiar faces, but loved the movie, and wants to see it again. It is very inspiring, and has comedy, music, and the opportunity to watch someone drawn to their faith for the first time and the rewards it brings. Lots of great and well known actors in the movie, and an appearance from gospel great Kirk Franklin, who leads the church choir in the film. There are some other cameos as well, but I do hot want to ruin the suprises.All in all the movie was great, production and quality was as top notch as anything else we rent.

There are drugs, girls, violence--but all shown so your Grandmother could watch it.Also part of the story is an elderly lady, Memaw, who takes an interest in Tommy and attempts to get him involved in church and the choir.  Memaw has a lovely granddaughter, Tamera Mowry-Housley (of Sister, Sister), that Tommy is very interested in.The story has lots of twists and turns and really keeps your interest.
