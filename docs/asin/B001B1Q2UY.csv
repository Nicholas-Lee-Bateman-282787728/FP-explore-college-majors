When someone who is the caliber of a major film star tackles one of these tv shows, what a difference. Rhys Ifans played the defendant in this season and dominated it from beginning to end.  Yes, everyone else is good but you can't see anyone else in this giving Hugh Grant a run for the money, which is what Ifans subsequently did. Ifans makes films nowadays, not tv.  Everyone else on this show is still on tv, at most.  This is absolutely no surprise whatsoever.  There is a chemistry he has with the camera, a magnetism, which the others simply lack.  I've watched later seasons of this show.  They are not better or worse as far as the show itself but they simply do not have anyone of Rhys Ifans's ability on them.  So this is the five star one to watch.As for the tv show itself.  Like most UK crime shows, it is extremely well written and extremely realistic.  It does not shirk from going every gritty mile into the dankest corners of criminal law.  American network crime tv shows do not do this although I'm pleased to say that American cable tv has gone where network never dared go before with nitty gritty crime.This is a child sexual assault and murder case.  When the episode opened, we were looking at this beautiful little girl and I thought right then that maybe parents shouldn't let their children be that visibly beautiful in public places. With her beautiful wind tousled curly blonde hair, limpid blue eyes, perfect english rose complexion, she is bait supreme out alone on the street, unattended by parent, babysitter or grandparent. The police go about solving her murder and there are two suspects: the stepfather and Rhys Ifans, as a general neer do well, whose principal vice seems to be public drunkenness.Ironically, he ends up getting first rate legal representation in the UK.  If this was as realistic as everything else in the show, British indigent defendants sure get better representation than their American counterparts.  He couldn't have done any better if he were rich.This episode does not wrap everything up in a nice, tidy bow for the audience.  The ending is disturbing, as is the whole episode.Lynda LaPlante, the producer and creator, is a seasoned and excellent writer and producer, previously known for PRIME SUSPECT with Helen Mirren.

It is my understanding that there are fourteen series, so I have miles to go. I am such a fan of the UK police procedural/mysteries.Trial and Retribution is written by Lynda LaPlante. Of note she wrote the exquisite, 'Prime Suspect' series. And, just like that series, just when you think you have a handle on 'whodunnit', a new character/suspect is added to the plot. We meet Detective Inspector, Pat North, played by Kate Buffery, and Detective Superintendent, Mike Walker, played by David Hayman. Right off, we get to see how the police work. Pat is part of the London Police and Mike is part of the London CID-Criminal Investigation Department. This is a real plus, to see how the hierarchy works, and who is in charge and what is demanded of each participant.  In the second series we get to know about the private lives of Pat and Mike. I liked Mike, but he seemed to me, to be the exact opposite of what Pat would want in a man. She is above board, fairly open and loves her job. Pat is the one character I really admired, andd wanted to see in the rest of the series. Mike is sexist and racist and a homophobe. He comes from a tough Scottish background, and it seems he worked his way up from the gutter. Series One gives us a good background into how this group/squad works, and Mike is impressed with Pat and her work. And, it appears that Pat thinks the same of Mike. They work well together, and the first case involving a missing child shows this.Trial and Retribution gives us the case and how it is solved, and then we go to the courtroom. Many surprises abound, but I quite like the British legal system. Surely it is as corrupt as ours, but we see the good lights. The use of split screens is very effective, as one person is talking and we can see the actual event in action.

Schwartz,"[4, 5]","This Lynda LaPlante project recalls key elements of the Prime Suspect series--a solid, shrewd female investigator leads a team of assistants in solving a heinous crime.  In this case, however, the woman is replaced by a man who keeps her in the loop and works with her as a trusted partner.  A prime suspect is identified and the case is pursued through its many stages until we reach the trial.  When new information surfaces during the trial the detectives are back in the field again, racing against the clock to find a crucial bit of evidence.  The setting, the characters, the relatives of the victim and the perpetrator are all gritty.  This is East London: gray bordering on grim, definitely not theme-park Britain.  The direction is somewhat odd, with ample use of split-screen images, some of which work and some of which merely seem odd.  There are inconsistencies in the evidence and shaky elements in the plot, just as in real life.  Set 1 involves the abduction, abuse and murder of a small child.  Steel yourself.

1169990,A3PNDMRLN6R9QS,B001B1Q2UY,Song & story lover,"[20, 22]","I really appreciate the review here given by Donegal Dan, as he mentions the grim and grisly nature of crimes investigated in this series.  With La Plante's writing, this series has been compared to Prime Suspect.  And there definitely are many commonalities between the two series.  Yet, where they differ is the reason for my dropping a couple of stars from my rating (certainly not due to the direction or casting, both of which are excellent).  No, what Prime Suspect has that Trial and Retribution does not is Helen Mirren, who manages to bring such humanity to her character.  And, by this I mean, not only the human impact of dealing with the sordid and disturbing elements of crime, but Helen Mirren's capacity to bring to whatever she does a fully 3-dimensional character.  That is missing in T&R; -- La Plante offers us no real depth in the lead characters we're spending all this time with in T&R; -- and the series is poorer for it.It would help this series enormously were there some brighter lighting on the sets.  Spending an entire episode in the dimly or starkly lit rooms where most of the interpersonal 'action' takes place simply underscores that we're visiting a very dark layer of human society.  I realize that this is the point, but for a viewer, it can leave you feeling, ""Why did I subject myself to that for the past two hours when I could be uplifted by watching something with Helen Mirren Judi Dench instead?""  My point about the lighting is that there is no relief anywhere -- and, since most of us are not studying to become criminalists but are looking for a captivating viewing experience, the dark feel and look of these episodes can feel overbearing.Yes, this series is a solid production with many strong elements.  But it does leave a foul taste when the story is done (or as Donegal Dan put it), it can 'turn your stomach.' Indeed, yes.  I won't be continuing with Season 2 -- I've had quite enough, thank you.",3,Just a bit too dark for me,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,1949,"['really', 'appreciate', 'review', 'here', 'given', 'Donegal', 'Dan', 'grim', 'grisly', 'nature', 'crimes', 'investigated', 'series', 'La', 'Plante', 'writing', 'series', 'been', 'compared', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'definitely', 'are', 'many', 'commonalities', 'two', 'series', 'where', 'differ', 'reason', 'dropping', 'couple', 'stars', 'rating', 'certainly', 'not', 'due', 'direction', 'casting', 'are', 'excellent', 'No', 'what', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'Trial', 'Retribution', 'not', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'bring', 'such', 'humanity', 'character', 'mean', 'not', 'only', 'human', 'impact', 'dealing', 'sordid', 'disturbing', 'elements', 'crime', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'capacity', 'bring', 'whatever', 'fully', '3-dimensional', 'character', 'missing', 'T', 'R', 'La', 'Plante', 'real', 'depth', 'lead', 'characters', ""'re"", 'spending', 'time', 'T', 'R', 'series', 'poorer', 'it.It', 'would', 'help', 'series', 'enormously', 'were', 'brighter', 'lighting', 'sets', 'Spending', 'entire', 'episode', 'dimly', 'starkly', 'lit', 'rooms', 'where', 'most', 'interpersonal', ""'action"", 'place', 'simply', ""'re"", 'visiting', 'very', 'dark', 'layer', 'human', 'society', 'realize', 'point', 'viewer', 'can', 'leave', 'feeling', 'Why', 'did', 'subject', 'past', 'two', 'hours', 'when', 'could', 'be', 'uplifted', 'watching', 'something', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'instead', 'point', 'lighting', 'relief', 'anywhere', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'studying', 'become', 'criminalists', 'are', 'looking', 'captivating', 'viewing', 'experience', 'dark', 'feel', 'look', 'episodes', 'can', 'feel', 'overbearing.Yes', 'series', 'solid', 'production', 'many', 'strong', 'elements', 'leave', 'foul', 'taste', 'when', 'story', 'done', 'Donegal', 'Dan', 'put', 'can', ""'turn"", 'stomach', 'Indeed', 'yes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'continuing', 'Season', '2', ""'ve"", 'had', 'quite', 'enough', 'thank']","TRIAL & RETRIBUTION, SET 1"

1169992,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B001B1Q2UY,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[45, 47]","Those familiar with the British crime-drama series Prime Suspect will already be familiar with the top-notch writing skills of Lynda La Plante, and those who've enjoyed Prime Suspect will certainly enjoy Trial & Retribution.  This is a highly engrossing, intellectually satisfying, consummately acted series with strong, richly woven, impeccably written storylines that draw one in and keep one enrapt throughout.Unlike Prime Suspect, this series centres around the lives of two senior police officers and the ensuing relationship (both personal and professional) between them.  Detective Superintendent Mike Walker (David Hayman) is a feisty, intense, no-nonsense little Jack Russell who rips the filters off his cigarettes.  A Scotsman with a nose for the business and a loathing for criminal scum, he's a cop who gets results.  He's not, however, a very nice man; more to the point, from a human standpoint he's actually very flawed--a fact which becomes increasingly (indeed disturbingly) more evident as the series progresses.Personality-wise, Detective Inspector Pat North (Kate Buffery) is Mike's polar opposite--well, she'd have to be in order to get along with Mike.  A bit rumpled, even haggard in appearance, she's serious, concientious, and ambitious, but she takes things at a calmer more methodical pace, thinking things out first rather than shooting from the hip (as Mike tends to do).Another feature which distinguishes this series from Prime Suspect (or most other crime-dramas for that matter) is that each episode follows the crime not only through the amassing of evidence and eventual arrest of a suspect but through the trial as well.  Of course, once the trial commences, time is of the essence should any new evidence come to light!  This is a series which is superbly acted by the strongest of casts, and the actors portraying the barristers are no exceptions.  I was particularly captivated by their consummately orated soliloquies and examinations of witnesses--one really is on the edge of one's seat throughout.No review of this exceptional series would be complete without mention of the highly sophisticated and innovative directing.  The show will often break into a split screen (for example when a witness is describing what he or she saw) which has proven to be a highly effective technique.  It was La Plante's innovation (and one which she had to fight for), and lest one thinks it sounds weird and intrusive, it is done so professionally and smoothly that the transitions are barely noticeable.British or otherwise, of all the crime dramas ever produced, Trial & Retribution is one of the very best ever made (and is my own personal favourite), and I highly, HIGHLY recommend it.  It is unpredictable, intelligent, rivetting, and very sophisticatedly directed, not to mention flawlessly acted.  It is also highly realistic (La Plante, who also produced the series, had her scripts edited by various police and forensic specialists for accuracy).  This boxed set includes the first four series made between 1997 and 2000, each of which consists of one 200-minute story split into two 100-minute episodes.  Nineteen series have been made to date (of which I've seen about half) with more in the works.  I can only hope that Acorn will release this series in its entirety--if any series deserves a complete release, this one does!  Finally, if you enjoy this series and are looking for other top-notch crime-dramas, I also recommend The Commander (also by La Plante) and The Vice (starring Ken Stott).",5,One of the VERY BEST crime-dramas ever produced!,1226188800,"11 9, 2008",2008,3537,"['familiar', 'British', 'crime-drama', 'series', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'will', 'already', 'be', 'familiar', 'top-notch', 'writing', 'skills', 'Lynda', 'La', 'Plante', 'who', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'will', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'Trial', 'Retribution', 'highly', 'engrossing', 'intellectually', 'satisfying', 'consummately', 'acted', 'series', 'strong', 'richly', 'woven', 'impeccably', 'written', 'storylines', 'draw', 'one', 'keep', 'one', 'enrapt', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'series', 'lives', 'two', 'senior', 'police', 'officers', 'ensuing', 'relationship', 'personal', 'professional', 'Detective', 'Superintendent', 'Mike', 'Walker', 'David', 'Hayman', 'feisty', 'intense', 'no-nonsense', 'little', 'Jack', 'Russell', 'who', 'filters', 'cigarettes', 'Scotsman', 'nose', 'business', 'loathing', 'criminal', 'scum', 'cop', 'who', 'results', 'not', 'however', 'very', 'nice', 'man', 'more', 'point', 'human', 'standpoint', 'actually', 'very', 'flawed', 'fact', 'increasingly', 'indeed', 'disturbingly', 'more', 'evident', 'series', 'progresses.Personality-wise', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'Pat', 'North', 'Kate', 'Buffery', 'Mike', 'polar', 'opposite', 'well', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'order', 'get', 'Mike', 'A', 'bit', 'rumpled', 'even', 'haggard', 'appearance', 'serious', 'concientious', 'ambitious', 'things', 'calmer', 'more', 'methodical', 'pace', 'thinking', 'things', 'out', 'first', 'rather', 'shooting', 'hip', 'Mike', 'do', '.Another', 'feature', 'series', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'most', 'other', 'crime-dramas', 'matter', 'episode', 'crime', 'not', 'only', 'amassing', 'evidence', 'eventual', 'arrest', 'suspect', 'trial', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'once', 'trial', 'commences', 'time', 'essence', 'should', 'new', 'evidence', 'come', 'light', 'series', 'superbly', 'acted', 'strongest', 'casts', 'actors', 'portraying', 'barristers', 'are', 'exceptions', 'was', 'particularly', 'captivated', 'consummately', 'orated', 'soliloquies', 'examinations', 'witnesses', 'one', 'really', 'edge', 'one', 'seat', 'throughout.No', 'review', 'exceptional', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'mention', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'innovative', 'directing', 'show', 'will', 'often', 'break', 'split', 'screen', 'example', 'when', 'witness', 'describing', 'what', 'saw', 'proven', 'be', 'highly', 'effective', 'technique', 'was', 'La', 'Plante', 'innovation', 'one', 'had', 'fight', 'lest', 'one', 'weird', 'intrusive', 'done', 'so', 'professionally', 'smoothly', 'transitions', 'are', 'barely', 'noticeable.British', 'otherwise', 'crime', 'dramas', 'ever', 'produced', 'Trial', 'Retribution', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'ever', 'made', 'own', 'personal', 'favourite', 'highly', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'unpredictable', 'intelligent', 'rivetting', 'very', 'sophisticatedly', 'directed', 'not', 'mention', 'flawlessly', 'acted', 'also', 'highly', 'realistic', 'La', 'Plante', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'series', 'had', 'scripts', 'edited', 'various', 'police', 'forensic', 'specialists', 'accuracy', 'boxed', 'set', 'first', 'four', 'series', 'made', '1997', '2000', 'one', '200-minute', 'story', 'split', 'two', '100-minute', 'episodes', 'Nineteen', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'date', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'half', 'more', 'works', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Acorn', 'will', 'release', 'series', 'entirety', 'series', 'complete', 'release', 'one', 'Finally', 'enjoy', 'series', 'are', 'looking', 'other', 'top-notch', 'crime-dramas', 'also', 'recommend', 'Commander', 'also', 'La', 'Plante', 'Vice', 'starring', 'Ken', 'Stott']","TRIAL & RETRIBUTION, SET 1"
