The story is simple, Jack (Duplass) has still not fully come to terms with the death of his brother Tom, so Tom's ex-girlfriend Iris (Blunt) who's also Jack's best friend suggests Jack spend some alone time in her family's remote cabin in the woods. So once Jack arrives at the cabin, someone is already staying there, Iris's neurotic sister Hannah (Dewitt). Jack takes immediate liking to Hannah and something happens that makes for an interesting film, I won't give away more than that but I truly felt Your Sister's Sister is a funny and true-to-life film. The acting is superb, the writing is flawless, and I highly recommend this adorable indie flick, enjoy!",5,Three's a crowd.,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,802,"['Sister', 'Sister', 'quirky', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'starring', 'very', 'talented', 'cast', 'including', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Rosemarie', 'Dewitt', 'story', 'simple', 'Jack', 'Duplass', 'still', 'not', 'fully', 'come', 'terms', 'death', 'brother', 'Tom', 'Tom', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Iris', 'Blunt', 'who', 'also', 'Jack', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'spend', 'alone', 'time', 'family', 'remote', 'cabin', 'woods', 'So', 'once', 'Jack', 'cabin', 'someone', 'already', 'staying', 'there', 'Iris', 'neurotic', 'sister', 'Hannah', 'Dewitt', 'Jack', 'immediate', 'liking', 'Hannah', 'something', 'happens', 'interesting', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'truly', 'felt', 'Your', 'Sister', 'Sister', 'funny', 'true-to-life', 'film', 'acting', 'superb', 'writing', 'flawless', 'highly', 'recommend', 'adorable', 'indie', 'flick', 'enjoy']",N/A

Essentially the movie is just a vehicle for some wonderful acting, particularly by Rosemarie Dewitt and also by Duplass and Blunt. The dialogue seems to flow naturally, which I imagine is a result of some good writing but more from the actors' skill. The movie as a whole probably deserves more of a 2, but I was glad I watched for the acting. That said, that's the only reason I would recommend watching this.

She has such a wonderful sensitivity and warmth &#34;up close,&#34; and I like her in roles where relationships are at stake. This movie is good enough- the set-up that cast the 3 characters alone together in a remote woodsy family house in San Juan Island in Puget Sound was plausible. I found the dramatic tensions a little &#34;off,&#34; though. Not bad! Just not particularly strong. SPOILER- For example, the fact that Mark Duplass' character had drunken sex with Rosemary Dewitt&#8217;s character- Emily Blunt's lesbian older sister- at a time when &#8220;best friends&#8221; Mark-Emily had never had a romance or any kind of sexual commitment to each other was simply not believable as a cause for so much angst and fear in the trio. At least to me- I was thinking- &#34;Hey- It happened. No one was cheating- it was just an innocent, if later on momentarily awkward, set of circumstances that occurs in life. I really didn't buy the notion that so much drama would have spun out of that.

1549203,A38M4BOJ8XXH1X,B0089XJXRQ,"Flippy ""Buchlieber""","[1, 2]","I agree with another reviewer, this film avoids taking risks. I had seen the trailer not too long ago and was looking forward to the rental. When I eventually saw the film, I found it scattered and dull.First things first, it begins on an interesting note. Several friends have gathered to remember Jack's brother. They are drinking beer and remembering the best of this man, telling comical and heart warming stories. But Jack (Duplass) won't have it. He knew his brother too well and brings a note of reality to the memorial. He can't glorify his brother because he knew this guy, grew up under him. His brother was supposedly altruistic and volunteered, a great guy because he knew it would get him laid. His brother wasn't a saint but a self-serving ass like everyone else.In a friendly aside, Iris (Blunt) suggests Jack get away from everything. She cares for him. She dated Jack's brother. Jack is part of her world. She basically has the prescription: you're going to get on the ferry and go to my father's cabin.Sounds like a plan, Jack. We, the audience, are on board. The movie feels right, natural.Then, when he arrives at the cabin, it kind of just falters. We are immediately introduced to Hannah (DeWitt), Iris' sister who is staying at the cabin. Jack spies the sexy Hannah fresh from the shower through the back window. We see she is sensual and beautiful but this 'peeping tom' moment is awkward and forced and without believability. Of course he makes himself known, the derivative stumble, the crashing of something on the deck, she comes out ready to attack. Pretty cliched. After the awkward introductions, the two settle down to what feels like a college tequila drinking contest where the two actor's mail in their reason for being at the cabin. Hannah, a lesbian, is there to get over a relationship; Jack, of course, to deal with grief.And that's basically the last we here of Jack's reason for being there. Like the introduction, the conversation feels stilted, the writing of the scene fairly uninspired. When they have sex, you can't believe it, despite their intoxicated states that such a pathetic encounter could have transpired between two people. Again, the writing. The actors fumble through the scene and we the audience are just as happy that it's over.Of course, Iris has to come the next day to check on her friend. Hannah and Mark share more of the same fumbling around with each other (they are in the same bed when Irish arrives - yawn... saw that coming). Through the next twenty minutes it's all about keeping everything under wraps because surprise (not really), Hannah suspects Jack has feelings for Iris (here, the minor spoiler alert and one more). Jack soon learns that Hannah wanted to have a baby with her ex and that's the reason for the break-up (spoilers done). You can imagine how Jack feels about the blundering tryst the night before and after that, more fumbling and awkwardness.From there, it's all about the trio coming to grips with their secrets. The audience is less focused on anything else. There is no exploration into the philosophies and pangs of lost love or grief. There are no layers. You don't get a sense anymore that Hannah had a relationship or Jack lost a brother. It all becomes trite and melodramatic.

1549204,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B0089XJXRQ,FNDNreview,"[0, 0]","Written and directed by Lynn Shelton, Your Sister's Sister stars Mark Duplass as Jack, Emily Blunt as Iris, and Rosemarie DeWitt as Hannah - three individuals intertwined by love, secrets, and a log cabin.  One year after losing his brother, Jack looks to get away for a weekend and is sent by Iris to her secluded family cabin.  Once he arrives, Jack finds Iris' sister, Hannah, already staying there and after a night of drinking and a one night stand, Iris arrives the following day to share her true feelings for Jack.Let's just get this out of the way - because while the plot of this film is a bit farfetched and melodramatic, this particular plot should NOT overshadow the brilliant acting displayed in this film by each one of these performers.  When there are literally only three people in the entire film and those three people manage to make a mediocre story into something interesting and emotional - all be it occasionally funny, sometimes silly - it's hard not to be impressed.  Duplass, Blunt, and DeWitt play their parts perfectly and will have you eating out of their hands with every single word uttered as they navigate through their emotional struggles.Overall, this film is average at best, leaning towards good - but regardless of the grade, Shelton obviously has an interesting story to tell.  The ending in itself is worth the rental or purchase.  If nothing else, watch this film for the sheer brilliant acting.  You won't be disappointed - and if you are, we will have to agree to disagree this week.Enjoy.Overall Film Grade:  B-The Friday Night Date Night ReviewFacebook.com/FNDNReview",4,Review: Your Sister's Sister (2012),1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,1613,"['Written', 'directed', 'Lynn', 'Shelton', 'Your', 'Sister', 'Sister', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'Jack', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Iris', 'Rosemarie', 'DeWitt', 'Hannah', 'three', 'individuals', 'intertwined', 'love', 'secrets', 'log', 'cabin', 'One', 'year', 'losing', 'brother', 'Jack', 'get', 'away', 'weekend', 'sent', 'Iris', 'secluded', 'family', 'cabin', 'Once', 'Jack', 'Iris', 'sister', 'Hannah', 'already', 'staying', 'there', 'night', 'drinking', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Iris', 'following', 'day', 'share', 'true', 'feelings', 'Jack.Let', 'just', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'plot', 'film', 'bit', 'farfetched', 'melodramatic', 'particular', 'plot', 'should', 'NOT', 'overshadow', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'displayed', 'film', 'one', 'performers', 'When', 'are', 'literally', 'only', 'three', 'people', 'entire', 'film', 'three', 'people', 'manage', 'make', 'mediocre', 'story', 'something', 'interesting', 'emotional', 'be', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'silly', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'impressed', 'Duplass', 'Blunt', 'DeWitt', 'play', 'parts', 'perfectly', 'will', 'have', 'eating', 'hands', 'single', 'word', 'uttered', 'navigate', 'emotional', 'struggles.Overall', 'film', 'average', 'best', 'leaning', 'towards', 'good', 'regardless', 'grade', 'Shelton', 'obviously', 'interesting', 'story', 'tell', 'ending', 'rental', 'purchase', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'film', 'sheer', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'will', 'have', 'agree', 'disagree', 'week.Enjoy.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'B-The', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Date', 'Night', 'ReviewFacebook.com/FNDNReview']",N/A

1549219,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0089XJXRQ,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","Aptly titled, the film only has 3 primary characters.  Jack (Mark Duplass) is a man struggling with his emotions and perhaps guilt over the death of his beloved brother a year earlier.  His best friend Iris (Emily Blunt) was his brother's girlfriend.  They are not romantic but care for each other.  Iris suggests Jack go to her father's cabin on an island in Puget Sound and discover some inner peace.When Jack arrives, he finds an attractive woman already at the cabin.  After some stumbling and fumbling, they realize that the woman is Iris's sister Hannah (Rosemarie DeWitt).  Unable to sleep, Hannah and Jack tell each other their sob stories over a bottle of tequila.  Hannah has just ended a 7 year lesbian relationship and had gone to the cabin to get over it.  After both get blitzed, they decide to give the old boy-girl sex a try.  Hmm.  Well, they're drunk so I bought it.The next morning, Iris surprises Jack and Hannah, showing up at the cabin.  They decide to keep their one-time liaison a secret until Iris confides in Hannah she is in love with Jack.  So now what?  Well that's the rest of the movie and it wouldn't be fair to give much more away.  Directed and written by Lynn Shelton, the movie is funny, tender and honest.  The film is beautifully photographed (Benjamin Kasulke) showing the wonder of this part of the world.  I was also taken the mostly acoustic score written by Vinny Smith.  The movie is well written, well-acted and had a perfect ending.This Blu ray transfer has a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and is in 1080p.  It appears to be digitally shot on HD cameras and as noted above, I thought the locations and technology were good in the movie and show well on the disc.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is excellent.  I did notice some unusual placement of some of the music.  I use some front ""effects"" speakers in my home theater set up and for one of the few times they were noticeable...in a good way.

1549226,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B0089XJXRQ,Paul Allaer,"[30, 35]","""Your Sister's Sister"" (90 min.) starts off with an eye-popping 5 min. prologue: we see a group of people mourning someone's passing, and just when one of them is giving a eulogy on how great a guy that person was, Jack (played by Mark Duplass) interupts and gives his own (less idyllic) version of that man, who turns out to be his brother. Iris (played by Emily Blunt), who is Jack's best friend and was the girlfriend of his brother, eventually talks to Jack to control his emotions.Flash forward: at Iris' suggestion, Jack agrees to retreat to the country house of Iris' family, to 'clear his head' and some much needed 'me time'. Much to Jack's surprise, it turns out that Iris' sister Hannah (played by Rosemarie DeWitt) is also there, also in need of some 'me time' after just coming out of a 7 year relationship. The next 20 min. or so nothing happens, other than Hannah and Jack sitting at the dinner table and talking, talking, talking (it's done brilliantly). Things develop from there, as Iris then shows up as well. To give away much more of the plot would really ruin your viewing experience.This is a talk movie (filmed theatre-like) about relationships. There are no pyrotechnics, no special effects, no CGIs. Instead, this movie centers on 3 acting performances, and each of them is as good as the other. Emily Blunt continues her impressive streak of recent performances (just this year we've seen her in Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, The Five Year Engagement, and now this). But the ultimate credit must go to writer-director Lynn Shelton, who brings it all home. This is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare. If you are in the mood for a good indie movie that has no action whatsover but focuses on relationships, come on over, you will very much enjoy this.

They are really step sisters but who cares? Emily's best friend is Jack played by MarkDuplass. Mark is new to me in the acting word, but he is superb. He plays the laid back ex-brother-in-law to Emily. She was married to his brother but split because things didn't work out. It is the anniversary of the brother's death, and friends meet and greet. Jack has unresolved issues and Iris suggests he go to her family's cabin, an island off Seattle. Indeed he does, he bikes to the ferry and then onto the island. Breathless he arrives, only to find Hannah there trying to get over a seven year relationship. They talk, Hannah says it is fine for Jack to stay. They get along and  things seem fine and dandy. The next day, Iris shows up with food for Jack, surprised to find Hannah.This is a 'feeling, talking ' film that all will enjoy. It seemed at times to be more of an unscripted film, the flow is so well done. Little looks, asides, umm's and ahh's are placed just right.  The film really succeeds because no one pushes too hard, no one is over the top, the acting is just superb. The storyline is not cliched as played. The scenery is beautiful to and fro from the island. This is an entertaining film right from the get go!Highly Recommended.  prisrob 01-13-13[[ASIN:B002MQU2JE Sunshine Cleaning][[ASIN:B004W7FX18 How I Got Lost]]True Adolescents",4,Lord Help The Mister Who Comes Between Me and My Sister,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,1549,"['Lord', 'help', 'mister', 'who', 'sisterAnd', 'lord', 'help', 'sister', 'who', 'man', 'Irving', 'BerlinEmily', 'Blunt', 'Iris', 'sister', 'Hannah', 'played', 'Rosemarie', 'Dewitt', 'are', 'really', 'step', 'sisters', 'who', 'Emily', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'played', 'MarkDuplass', 'Mark', 'new', 'acting', 'word', 'superb', 'laid', 'back', 'ex-brother-in-law', 'Emily', 'was', 'married', 'brother', 'split', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'anniversary', 'brother', 'death', 'meet', 'greet', 'Jack', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'Iris', 'go', 'family', 'cabin', 'island', 'off', 'Seattle', 'Indeed', 'ferry', 'then', 'island', 'only', 'find', 'Hannah', 'there', 'trying', 'get', 'seven', 'year', 'relationship', 'talk', 'Hannah', 'fine', 'Jack', 'stay', 'get', 'along', 'things', 'seem', 'fine', 'dandy', 'next', 'day', 'Iris', 'up', 'food', 'Jack', 'surprised', 'find', 'Hannah.This', ""'feeling"", 'talking', 'film', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seemed', 'times', 'be', 'more', 'unscripted', 'film', 'flow', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'Little', 'looks', 'asides', 'umm', 'ahh', 'are', 'placed', 'just', 'right', 'film', 'really', 'one', 'too', 'hard', 'one', 'top', 'acting', 'just', 'superb', 'storyline', 'not', 'cliched', 'played', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'fro', 'island', 'entertaining', 'film', 'right', 'get', 'go', 'Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '01-13-13', '[', '[', 'ASIN', 'B002MQU2JE', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', ']', '[', '[', 'ASIN', 'B004W7FX18', 'How', 'Got', 'Lost', ']', ']', 'True', 'Adolescents']",N/A

1549232,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0089XJXRQ,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","YOUR SISTER'S SISTER is a very uneven movie that seems both very naturalistic and very self-aware at the same time.  Except for the opening scene, the movie is almost entirely focused at one rustic lake house on an island off the coast of Seattle.  And except for that opening scene, the movie is almost entirely peopled by just 3 characters.In the opening scene, we see a group of friends chatting in an apartment building and handing around photos of Tom, a friend who has recently died and they are all gathered to informally eulogize.  Tom's close friend, played by Mike Birbiglia (sounding just like Mike Birbiglia always sounds) begins telling of all the great characteristics Tom had.  Tom is warmly toasted by all...except for his brother Jack (Mark Duplass), who has a few less than wonderful things to say about Tom.  His awkward statements lead to social embarrassment, and he is mildly confronted by Iris (Emily Blunt)...who is (in a situation likely only in movies) both Jack's best friend AND Tom's ex-girlfriend.  She encourages Jack, who is clearly adrift and somewhat tortured by the loss of his brother and the general malaise of his life, to take some time and spend a few days at her parent's old lake house.  Just get away and think about your life.  (Again, it feels very much like a movie device...in no way do you get the sense that Jack would benefit from time alone with himself, since he so clearly loathes himself.)But he doesn't get to spend alone time, because when he arrives, he discovers the lake house is already occupied, by Iris' sister Hannah (Rosemarie DeWitt).  Hannah has ALSO come to the lake house to nurse her wounds, because her long term relationship with her girlfriend has come to an end.  The two have never met, but they quickly bond over a bottle of tequila...and mild mischief and misunderstandings ensue, especially when Iris decides to take time off work and visit her buddy.I won't tell you any more about the plot.  This movie is all about the relationships between these 3 characters, and suffice it to say that more complexities are revealed.  And these 3 have lots of time to lie around the house and work things out.  Only in a movie would characters be able to walk away from any normal responsibilities to indulge their quest to sort out their feelings.Writer/director Lynn Shelton has set a chain of events in motion that never for one minute feel credible.  Yet at the same time, this self-aware ""movie-ness"" is offset by very natural, rambling dialogue.  It has an improvised feel and the 3 actors, especially Duplass & DeWitt, dive into their far from perfect characters with gusto.  Each has attractive qualities and each has serious weaknesses.  So despite the unconvincing plot machinations...the actual conversations and interactions between these 3 characters are interesting, convincing and involving.  True, these are all smart, articulate people who speak more eloquently than 99% of us...but they also occasionally struggle for words, get tripped up by their own idiocies and most movingly of all, sometimes their emotions render them speechless.  When you see a character that has proven the ability to talk, talk, talk suddenly unable to articulate their feelings, that is quite effective.  You root for these characters.Duplass & DeWitt are more comfortable with the improvisational style.  Blunt, who is an actress I like very much, comes off a bit more scripted and a bit less articulate...but the other characters are also more bitter, which lends itself to more witty sarcasm and self-excoriating observations.YOUR SISTER'S SISTER is not a fast-paced movie.  It is as languid as the lakeside scenery.  It is likely to bore a viewer interested in lots of forward momentum.  But if you're interested in some intelligent acting and a fairly engrossing interpersonal comedy/drama...you might find enough to like in Shelton's uneven but admirable work.",3,Flawed but well-acted indie.  3.5 stars.,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,3928,"['SISTER', 'SISTER', 'very', 'uneven', 'movie', 'very', 'naturalistic', 'very', 'self-aware', 'same', 'time', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'almost', 'entirely', 'focused', 'one', 'rustic', 'lake', 'house', 'island', 'coast', 'Seattle', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'almost', 'entirely', 'peopled', 'just', '3', 'characters.In', 'opening', 'scene', 'see', 'group', 'friends', 'chatting', 'apartment', 'building', 'handing', 'photos', 'Tom', 'friend', 'who', 'recently', 'died', 'are', 'gathered', 'informally', 'eulogize', 'Tom', 'close', 'friend', 'played', 'Mike', 'Birbiglia', 'sounding', 'just', 'Mike', 'Birbiglia', 'always', 'telling', 'great', 'characteristics', 'Tom', 'had', 'Tom', 'warmly', 'toasted', 'brother', 'Jack', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'who', 'few', 'less', 'wonderful', 'things', 'say', 'Tom', 'awkward', 'statements', 'lead', 'social', 'embarrassment', 'mildly', 'confronted', 'Iris', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'who', 'situation', 'likely', 'only', 'movies', 'Jack', 'best', 'friend', 'Tom', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Jack', 'who', 'clearly', 'adrift', 'somewhat', 'tortured', 'loss', 'brother', 'general', 'malaise', 'life', 'take', 'time', 'spend', 'few', 'days', 'parent', 'old', 'lake', 'house', 'Just', 'get', 'away', 'think', 'life', 'Again', 'very', 'much', 'movie', 'device', 'way', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'Jack', 'would', 'benefit', 'time', 'alone', 'so', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'get', 'spend', 'alone', 'time', 'when', 'lake', 'house', 'already', 'occupied', 'Iris', 'sister', 'Hannah', 'Rosemarie', 'DeWitt', 'Hannah', 'ALSO', 'come', 'lake', 'house', 'nurse', 'wounds', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'come', 'end', 'two', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'quickly', 'bond', 'bottle', 'tequila', 'mild', 'mischief', 'misunderstandings', 'ensue', 'especially', 'when', 'Iris', 'take', 'time', 'work', 'visit', 'buddy.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'movie', 'relationships', '3', 'characters', 'suffice', 'say', 'more', 'complexities', 'are', 'revealed', '3', 'have', 'lots', 'time', 'lie', 'house', 'work', 'things', 'out', 'Only', 'movie', 'would', 'characters', 'be', 'able', 'walk', 'away', 'normal', 'responsibilities', 'indulge', 'quest', 'sort', 'out', 'feelings.Writer/director', 'Lynn', 'Shelton', 'set', 'chain', 'events', 'motion', 'never', 'one', 'minute', 'feel', 'credible', 'same', 'time', 'self-aware', 'movie-ness', 'offset', 'very', 'natural', 'rambling', 'dialogue', 'improvised', 'feel', '3', 'actors', 'especially', 'Duplass', 'DeWitt', 'dive', 'far', 'perfect', 'characters', 'gusto', 'attractive', 'qualities', 'serious', 'weaknesses', 'So', 'unconvincing', 'plot', 'machinations', 'actual', 'conversations', 'interactions', '3', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'convincing', 'involving', 'True', 'are', 'smart', 'articulate', 'people', 'who', 'speak', 'more', 'eloquently', '99', '%', 'also', 'occasionally', 'struggle', 'words', 'get', 'tripped', 'up', 'own', 'idiocies', 'most', 'movingly', 'sometimes', 'emotions', 'render', 'speechless', 'When', 'see', 'character', 'proven', 'ability', 'talk', 'talk', 'talk', 'suddenly', 'unable', 'articulate', 'feelings', 'quite', 'effective', 'root', 'characters.Duplass', 'DeWitt', 'are', 'more', 'comfortable', 'improvisational', 'style', 'Blunt', 'who', 'actress', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'off', 'bit', 'more', 'scripted', 'bit', 'less', 'articulate', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'bitter', 'more', 'witty', 'sarcasm', 'self-excoriating', 'observations.YOUR', 'SISTER', 'SISTER', 'not', 'fast-paced', 'movie', 'as', 'languid', 'lakeside', 'scenery', 'likely', 'bore', 'viewer', 'interested', 'lots', 'forward', 'momentum', ""'re"", 'interested', 'intelligent', 'acting', 'fairly', 'engrossing', 'interpersonal', 'comedy/drama', 'might', 'find', 'enough', 'like', 'Shelton', 'uneven', 'admirable', 'work']",N/A

With this movie, written and directed by Lynn Shelton, I would advise to listen closely, as I am surmising that some, to quite a bit, of the conversation is improvised.  These actors are immensely comfortable with each other and the talk is witty, quick, sharp, and interestingly funny.  This is a different kind of Independent film and I liked the movie more so on the second view.  I think that during round one while watching this I missed how nuanced these actors are with each other.  They can be a strange brew, and it's a fly-on-the-wall approach to listening that is to your advantage.Beginning at a funeral, and during the Eulogy, Jack (Mark Duplass) decides to let everyone there know the real brother he had, as he cannot let go since his brother's death a year ago.  In an almost ranting style he unloads his harsh feelings in the group of mourners.  Iris (Emily Blunt), who was his brother's girlfriend, convinces him into a getaway for a respite at her family's beautiful and scenic, island home.  He arrives late at night to a very surprised Hannah (Rosemarie DeWitt), who is also staying there, and is Iris' sister. They are both there to get away from the hurtful reality of broken relationships so they begin drinking the night away...and talking.  Iris decides to pop in the next morning, unexpected by either of them.  What happens from this point on is a dance of secrets, feelings that do not come out at the right times or places, and a bit of chaos that is choreographed to move just right; if you are listening closely.  Give it a try if you are not into any action-type film at the time, because this offers up a plate of confusion, and each person tries their hardest to keep certain things hidden.

We start off at party on the anniversary of the death of Tom as a sort of eulogy.  Tom's brother is Jack (Mark Duplass) who loses the plot at the gathering and it is obvious to best friend and ex to his brother, Iris (Emily Blunt - `The Young Victoria' and `The Adjustment Bureau') that he needs some `me time'. So she offers him a stay at her father's isolated holiday home.So deciding she is right he sets out for the isolation of the house. Only when he gets there it is occupied by Iris's younger and lesbian sister - Hannah (Rosemarie Dewitt) who has split up with her partner. After initial awkwardness, they decide to drink some tequila to break the ice, actually a lot of tequila and thereby de frosting quite a lot. Then Iris turns up and adds a whole new dimension to the three way `relationship'.To say any more would stray into the realm of plot spoiling, but this film is just a fantastic gem; the sort of journey where the getting there is better than the actual destination. It is clever, funny, warm, intelligent and really human without straying into the path of sugariness that can often spoil a good film. This is in great part due to the director and writer of the screenplay, Lynn Shelton, who is also an accomplished actress in her own right. The cinematography is also excellent and even the music is good especially the acoustic guitar bits. So I really did love this film, and whilst it could be seen to be aimed at a feminine market, I think it works across more than one genre and as such deserves all the praise it has received so far and a fair bit more, highly recommended and watch with someone you love as it will make you feel all fuzzy - sorry I am getting schmaltzy now, I think I liked it a bit too much.",5,"Warm, Funny, Human and Very Good",1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,1900,"['titles', 'come', 'up', 'pink', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'oft', 'referred', 'chick-flick', 'actually', ""n't"", 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'start', 'off', 'party', 'anniversary', 'death', 'Tom', 'sort', 'eulogy', 'Tom', 'brother', 'Jack', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'who', 'plot', 'gathering', 'obvious', 'best', 'friend', 'ex', 'brother', 'Iris', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Young', 'Victoria', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'time', 'stay', 'father', 'isolated', 'holiday', 'home.So', 'deciding', 'right', 'out', 'isolation', 'house', 'Only', 'when', 'occupied', 'Iris', 'younger', 'lesbian', 'sister', 'Hannah', 'Rosemarie', 'Dewitt', 'who', 'split', 'up', 'partner', 'initial', 'awkwardness', 'decide', 'drink', 'tequila', 'break', 'ice', 'actually', 'lot', 'tequila', 'thereby', 'frosting', 'quite', 'lot', 'Then', 'Iris', 'up', 'whole', 'new', 'dimension', 'three', 'way', ""relationship'.To"", 'say', 'more', 'would', 'stray', 'realm', 'plot', 'spoiling', 'film', 'just', 'fantastic', 'gem', 'sort', 'journey', 'where', 'getting', 'better', 'actual', 'destination', 'clever', 'funny', 'warm', 'intelligent', 'really', 'human', 'straying', 'path', 'sugariness', 'can', 'often', 'spoil', 'good', 'film', 'great', 'part', 'due', 'director', 'writer', 'screenplay', 'Lynn', 'Shelton', 'who', 'also', 'accomplished', 'actress', 'own', 'right', 'cinematography', 'also', 'excellent', 'even', 'music', 'good', 'especially', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'bits', 'So', 'really', 'did', 'love', 'film', 'whilst', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'aimed', 'feminine', 'market', 'think', 'more', 'one', 'genre', 'such', 'deserves', 'praise', 'received', 'so', 'far', 'fair', 'bit', 'more', 'highly', 'recommended', 'watch', 'someone', 'love', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'fuzzy', 'sorry', 'am', 'getting', 'schmaltzy', 'now', 'think', 'liked', 'bit', 'too', 'much']",N/A

I would compare the humor and style of this to the movie ""Friends With Kids"" so if you liked that movie then you will most likely enjoy this one as well. The acting is very good which really drives the movie and you really feel for the characters throughout.

Like 'Humpday', 'Your Sister's Sister', features mostly improvised performances that are often breezy and entertaining.The film begins with friends gathered together to pay respects to their old friend, Tom, who has recently passed away. We meet Jack (Mark Duplass), Tom's grieving brother, who is comforted by Tom's ex-girlfriend (Emily Blunt). Iris suggests that Jack take time off to get himself together and go up to an island getaway cabin which belongs to her and her half-sister, Hannah (Rosemarie DeWitt).Jack bikes up to the cabin but is surprised to find Hannah there. Soon we learn that Hannah has just broken up with her Lesbian lover of seven years. After the two get drunk, surprisingly Hannah hops into bed with Jack (we later find out that she's not motivated due to any bisexual proclivities). The sex lasts about 90 seconds, with Jack basically experiencing a premature ejaculation.The next day Iris shows up and we learn a little bit more about them as they converse during various meals. Hannah, a vegan, gets all worked up when Iris jokes about putting a little butter in her mashed potatoes; and Iris takes umbrage at Hannah's reference to a past incident involving Iris shaving her pubic hair. Despite the witty banter, we find out little about the principals' backgrounds (what does everyone exactly do to support themselves?).Jack is an even more cryptic character. Is her suffering from Asperger's or is it simply he's become unhinged due to the death of his brother? One thing I had a hard time believing is why Iris falls for the brother of her ex-boyfriend. After all, Jack is hardly a likable character (recall how surly he is at the memorial and how he inappropriately puts his brother down). The fact that he's unemployed and has no direction in life should be a real big red flag for Iris. But she claims she's attracted to his offbeat sense of humor (Jack has a sense of humor? Yeah right!).Shelton wins points for the big twist in the plot which we don't see coming. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. At the same time Hannah reveals to Iris that she had sex with Jack, he discovers that she poked holes in the condom the night before. Hannah was only using Jack to possibly get pregnant.The end of 'Your Sister's Sister' unfortunately plays it a little too safe. After initially being angry with one another, the sisters let bygones be bygones, and bond once again. Jack, who wants to be alone, ends up camping out in the sticks and then bicycles into town, only to trash the bicycle, after he discovers it's broken. Jack shows up back at the cabin, apologizes to Iris for his indiscretion with Hannah, admits that he's screwed up (especially because he's unemployed and unable to support himself), but is willing to act as a parent to the child, that Hannah may or may not eventually have. All is forgiven and in a flurry of hugs, the triumvirate reassures one another that all will be well from now on. There's also a hint that Jack might get over his reluctance to shack up with Iris for the long run.'Your Sister's Sister' features witty performances from the three principals. With some deft plotting, Shelton holds our interest almost to the end. Only the sketchy characterizations and a denouement that feels a bit too saccharine, will prevent the discerning critic from doling out a few extra gold stars.",3,Tale of triumvirate fraught with sexual tension features deft plotting and breezy entertainment despite saccharine denouement,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,3563,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'Your"", 'Sister', 'Sister', 'Lynn', 'Shelton', 'writer/director', 'responsible', 'edgy', ""'Humpday"", 'featured', 'two', 'straight', 'guys', 'pushing', 'boundaries', 'contemplating', 'having', 'gay', 'sex', ""'Humpday"", ""'Your"", 'Sister', 'Sister', 'features', 'mostly', 'improvised', 'performances', 'are', 'often', 'breezy', 'entertaining.The', 'film', 'friends', 'gathered', 'together', 'pay', 'respects', 'old', 'friend', 'Tom', 'who', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'meet', 'Jack', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'Tom', 'grieving', 'brother', 'who', 'comforted', 'Tom', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Iris', 'Jack', 'take', 'time', 'get', 'together', 'go', 'up', 'island', 'getaway', 'cabin', 'half-sister', 'Hannah', 'Rosemarie', 'DeWitt', '.Jack', 'up', 'cabin', 'surprised', 'find', 'Hannah', 'there', 'Soon', 'learn', 'Hannah', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'Lesbian', 'lover', 'seven', 'years', 'two', 'get', 'drunk', 'surprisingly', 'Hannah', 'bed', 'Jack', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'motivated', 'due', 'bisexual', 'proclivities', 'sex', '90', 'seconds', 'Jack', 'basically', 'experiencing', 'premature', 'ejaculation.The', 'next', 'day', 'Iris', 'up', 'learn', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'about', 'converse', 'various', 'meals', 'Hannah', 'vegan', 'worked', 'up', 'when', 'Iris', 'putting', 'little', 'butter', 'mashed', 'potatoes', 'Iris', 'umbrage', 'Hannah', 'reference', 'past', 'incident', 'involving', 'Iris', 'shaving', 'pubic', 'hair', 'witty', 'banter', 'find', 'out', 'little', 'principals', 'backgrounds', 'what', 'everyone', 'exactly', 'do', 'support', '.Jack', 'even', 'more', 'cryptic', 'character', 'suffering', 'Asperger', 'simply', 'become', 'unhinged', 'due', 'death', 'brother', 'One', 'thing', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'why', 'Iris', 'brother', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Jack', 'hardly', 'likable', 'character', 'recall', 'how', 'surly', 'memorial', 'how', 'inappropriately', 'brother', 'down', 'fact', 'unemployed', 'direction', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'real', 'big', 'red', 'flag', 'Iris', 'attracted', 'offbeat', 'sense', 'humor', 'Jack', 'sense', 'humor', 'Yeah', 'right', '.Shelton', 'points', 'big', 'twist', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'SUPER', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'same', 'time', 'Hannah', 'reveals', 'Iris', 'had', 'sex', 'Jack', 'poked', 'holes', 'condom', 'night', 'Hannah', 'was', 'only', 'using', 'Jack', 'possibly', 'get', 'pregnant.The', 'end', ""'Your"", 'Sister', 'Sister', 'unfortunately', 'little', 'too', 'safe', 'initially', 'being', 'angry', 'one', 'sisters', 'let', 'bygones', 'be', 'bygones', 'bond', 'once', 'again', 'Jack', 'who', 'be', 'alone', 'up', 'camping', 'out', 'sticks', 'then', 'town', 'only', 'trash', 'bicycle', 'broken', 'Jack', 'up', 'back', 'cabin', 'Iris', 'indiscretion', 'Hannah', 'screwed', 'up', 'especially', 'unemployed', 'unable', 'support', 'willing', 'act', 'parent', 'child', 'Hannah', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'eventually', 'have', 'forgiven', 'flurry', 'hugs', 'triumvirate', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'now', 'also', 'hint', 'Jack', 'might', 'get', 'reluctance', 'shack', 'up', 'Iris', 'long', 'run', ""'Your"", 'Sister', 'Sister', 'features', 'witty', 'performances', 'three', 'principals', 'deft', 'plotting', 'Shelton', 'interest', 'almost', 'end', 'Only', 'sketchy', 'characterizations', 'denouement', 'bit', 'too', 'saccharine', 'will', 'prevent', 'discerning', 'critic', 'doling', 'out', 'few', 'extra', 'gold', 'stars']",N/A

Tom died a year ago and this group is still trying to get over Tom's death along with Tom's girl friend Iris (Blunt). Give me a break. During this memorial get together, Jack (Duplass) puts a wet blanket on the &#34;memorial party&#34; and rants on about his brother and how his brother was acting like a nice guy  &#34;just to get laid&#34; and that his brother &#34;...was a self-serving ass like everyone else.&#34; (albeit including him too).Unfortunately, we the audience suspect this will be the loathsome character we will have to follow for the next 90 minutes. Yuk. Iris (Blunt) suggests Jack get away from everything. She cares for him (almost like his mother).  She tells Jack you need to get away for awhile so why don't you go to my father's cabin. Okay, so he does and what do you know? There just happens to be a good looking young woman Hannah (DeWitt), Iris' sister, already living in the cabin. He fumbles around outside the cabin, accidentally makes a noise, and the woman comes running out with a paddle ready to confront the intruder.From here on the movie is gets predictable and contrived. She's a lesbian but apparently &#34;bi&#34; and they both get plastered on a mysterious bottle of booze (of which I would love to know the brand of  because they both suddenly get super horney and jump into the rack). As luck would have it, Iris surprisingly shows up the next day out of nowhere.You suddenly can tell the writer is a woman (obsessed with a lingering teenage sexual fantasy) because the dialogue is good on that level but awkward between the sisters. Jack leaves and he is  gone for several days riding his bike, camping out and pausing for moments of brooding. We don't have a clue as to how he is feeling, what's he thinking about and what exactly are his intentions after this liaison with Hannah. After watching this film I realized the dialogue and the interaction of the characters were basically on a teenage level instead of watching a group of &#34;30-something&#34;. Was the central character Jack or was it Iris? Why did this relationship of Jack and Iris suddenly &#34;turn on&#34; a whole year after Tom's death? Why did a grown man like Jack return, crying and on bended knee, to Iris to lament how sorry he was for his betrayal. You get the impression that these two had been lovers for a long time which was not the case at all.The thing that really intrigued me the most was to see how two great actresses like DeWitt and Blunt could work with an awkward, weak and juvenile script. Duplass as Jack came up short on this one.",2,Need More Mature Subject Matter,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,2632,"['Several', 'friends', 'have', 'gathered', 'remember', 'Jack', 'brother', 'Tom', 'Tom', 'died', 'year', 'ago', 'group', 'still', 'trying', 'get', 'Tom', 'death', 'Tom', 'girl', 'friend', 'Iris', 'Blunt', 'Give', 'break', 'memorial', 'get', 'together', 'Jack', 'Duplass', 'wet', 'blanket', '34', 'memorial', 'party', '34', 'rants', 'brother', 'how', 'brother', 'was', 'acting', 'nice', 'guy', '34', 'just', 'get', 'laid', '34', 'brother', '34', 'was', 'self-serving', 'ass', 'everyone', 'else.', '34', 'including', 'too', '.Unfortunately', 'audience', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'loathsome', 'character', 'will', 'have', 'follow', 'next', '90', 'minutes', 'Yuk', 'Iris', 'Blunt', 'Jack', 'get', 'away', 'everything', 'almost', 'mother', 'Jack', 'need', 'get', 'away', 'awhile', 'so', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'father', 'cabin', 'Okay', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'just', 'be', 'good', 'looking', 'young', 'woman', 'Hannah', 'DeWitt', 'Iris', 'sister', 'already', 'living', 'cabin', 'cabin', 'accidentally', 'noise', 'woman', 'running', 'out', 'paddle', 'ready', 'confront', 'intruder.From', 'here', 'movie', 'predictable', 'contrived', 'lesbian', 'apparently', '34', 'bi', '34', 'get', 'plastered', 'mysterious', 'bottle', 'booze', 'would', 'love', 'know', 'brand', 'suddenly', 'get', 'super', 'horney', 'jump', 'rack', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'Iris', 'surprisingly', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'nowhere.You', 'suddenly', 'can', 'tell', 'writer', 'woman', 'obsessed', 'lingering', 'teenage', 'sexual', 'fantasy', 'dialogue', 'good', 'level', 'awkward', 'sisters', 'Jack', 'gone', 'several', 'days', 'riding', 'bike', 'camping', 'out', 'pausing', 'moments', 'brooding', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'feeling', 'what', 'thinking', 'about', 'what', 'exactly', 'are', 'intentions', 'liaison', 'Hannah', 'watching', 'film', 'realized', 'dialogue', 'interaction', 'characters', 'were', 'basically', 'teenage', 'level', 'instead', 'watching', 'group', '34', '30-something', '34', 'central', 'character', 'Jack', 'was', 'Iris', 'Why', 'did', 'relationship', 'Jack', 'Iris', 'suddenly', '34', 'turn', '34', 'whole', 'year', 'Tom', 'death', 'Why', 'did', 'grown', 'man', 'Jack', 'return', 'crying', 'bended', 'knee', 'Iris', 'lament', 'how', 'sorry', 'was', 'betrayal', 'get', 'impression', 'two', 'had', 'been', 'lovers', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'all.The', 'thing', 'really', 'intrigued', 'most', 'was', 'see', 'how', 'two', 'great', 'actresses', 'DeWitt', 'Blunt', 'could', 'work', 'awkward', 'weak', 'juvenile', 'script', 'Duplass', 'Jack', 'came', 'up', 'short', 'one']",N/A
