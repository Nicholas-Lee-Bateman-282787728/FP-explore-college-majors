964151,A2PZCROOH45XKV,B000E0LLQ8,Amanda Horton,"[1, 1]","I started watching this series by accident here in England on CBS Action.  I was soon captivated by the relationship between the two male stars - characters Jim Ellison and Blair Sandburg - that along with the Police Captain Simon Banks makes this a really watchable show. Jim is The Sentinel whose heightened senses give him an edge in fighting crime in Cascade city.  Blair is his Guide who helps Jim to train and focus his senses so he can utilise them to their fullest potential.  Until Blair came along Jim was having a hard time with his Sentinel powers and it was slowly sending him insane as he was unable to control them.It has a bit of everything action, humour, excitement, drama, and it's basically great fun to watch.  It's amusing when Blair hardly gets called by his first name but everyone either just calls him Sandburg or he gets called all sorts of nicknames like ""Chief"" and ""Hairboy"".  It's these sorts of little details that make series so watchable for the fans.I ordered the DVDs as soon as I finished watching season 1.  I am eagerly awaiting the release of seasons 2 - 4 when those at be decide to do so, it's been 4 years since season 1 was released, so they're not exactly rushing to release them!!I would recommend anyone to purchase these DVDs and watch the show on CBS Action or wherever it's shown (on SyFy as well apparently) - you'll be glad you did.",5,The Sentinel by Manda Horton,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,1384,"['started', 'watching', 'series', 'accident', 'here', 'England', 'CBS', 'Action', 'was', 'soon', 'captivated', 'relationship', 'two', 'male', 'stars', 'characters', 'Jim', 'Ellison', 'Blair', 'Sandburg', 'Police', 'Captain', 'Simon', 'Banks', 'really', 'watchable', 'show', 'Jim', 'Sentinel', 'heightened', 'senses', 'give', 'edge', 'fighting', 'crime', 'Cascade', 'city', 'Blair', 'Guide', 'who', 'Jim', 'train', 'focus', 'senses', 'can', 'utilise', 'fullest', 'potential', 'Blair', 'came', 'along', 'Jim', 'was', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'Sentinel', 'powers', 'was', 'slowly', 'sending', 'insane', 'was', 'unable', 'control', 'them.It', 'bit', 'everything', 'action', 'humour', 'excitement', 'drama', 'basically', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'amusing', 'when', 'Blair', 'hardly', 'called', 'first', 'name', 'everyone', 'either', 'just', 'Sandburg', 'called', 'sorts', 'nicknames', 'Chief', 'Hairboy', 'sorts', 'little', 'details', 'make', 'series', 'so', 'watchable', 'fans.I', 'ordered', 'DVDs', 'as', 'soon', 'finished', 'watching', 'season', '1', 'am', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'release', 'seasons', '2', '4', 'when', 'be', 'decide', 'do', 'so', 'been', '4', 'years', 'season', '1', 'was', 'released', ""'re"", 'not', 'exactly', 'rushing', 'release', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'purchase', 'DVDs', 'watch', 'show', 'CBS', 'Action', 'wherever', 'shown', 'SyFy', 'as', 'well', 'apparently', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",SENTINEL: COMPLETE FIRST SEASON

964156,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B000E0LLQ8,D. S. Thurlow,"[2, 2]","""The Sentinel: The Complete First Season"" contains the initial 10 episodes for a unique police procedural, first aired in 1996.  Jim Ellison (a stalwart Richard Burgi) is the sole survivor of a Special Forces mission in the jungles of Peru.  Now a police detective in Cascade, Washington, Ellison discovers that he has acquired heightened senses highly useful in crime-fighting, if he can learn to control them.  His consultation with anthropology graduate student Blair Sandberg (Garrett Maggart) reveals that he has a rare genetic predisposition for heightened sensory powers.  Blair teams up with Jim to help him learn to control his unusual condition, while gathering material for what promises to be a fantastic graduate thesis.  Bruce Young is outstanding as the Police Chief.The ten episodes cover an variety of crimes and opponents, from simple killers to serial murders to gunrunners and drug traffickers.  Jim and Blair make an appealing team, if often hamstrung by clunky dialogue and very limited special effects.  Most episodes provide Ellison one or more opportunities to solve a crime or save a life using his remarkable ability to see, hear, smell, touch, or taste better than the average human.  One memorable episode has Blair trapped inside police headquarters, which has been taken over by a criminal gang, while Jim tries to break in.  Another, exceptionally innovative episode has Jim and Blair escorting a criminal on a train, only to have Jim's senses go haywire from a dose of cold medicine.The series was interesting in its time, and worth a look-back now.",3,The Sentinel: Something different...,1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,1582,"['Sentinel', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'initial', '10', 'episodes', 'unique', 'police', 'procedural', 'first', 'aired', '1996', 'Jim', 'Ellison', 'stalwart', 'Richard', 'Burgi', 'sole', 'survivor', 'Special', 'Forces', 'mission', 'jungles', 'Peru', 'Now', 'police', 'detective', 'Cascade', 'Washington', 'Ellison', 'acquired', 'heightened', 'senses', 'highly', 'useful', 'crime-fighting', 'can', 'learn', 'control', 'consultation', 'anthropology', 'graduate', 'student', 'Blair', 'Sandberg', 'Garrett', 'Maggart', 'rare', 'genetic', 'predisposition', 'heightened', 'sensory', 'powers', 'Blair', 'up', 'Jim', 'help', 'learn', 'control', 'unusual', 'condition', 'gathering', 'material', 'what', 'be', 'fantastic', 'graduate', 'thesis', 'Bruce', 'Young', 'outstanding', 'Police', 'Chief.The', 'ten', 'cover', 'variety', 'crimes', 'opponents', 'simple', 'killers', 'serial', 'murders', 'gunrunners', 'drug', 'traffickers', 'Jim', 'Blair', 'make', 'appealing', 'team', 'often', 'hamstrung', 'clunky', 'dialogue', 'very', 'limited', 'special', 'effects', 'Most', 'episodes', 'provide', 'Ellison', 'one', 'more', 'opportunities', 'solve', 'crime', 'save', 'life', 'using', 'remarkable', 'ability', 'see', 'hear', 'smell', 'touch', 'taste', 'better', 'average', 'human', 'One', 'memorable', 'episode', 'Blair', 'trapped', 'police', 'headquarters', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'criminal', 'gang', 'Jim', 'break', 'exceptionally', 'innovative', 'episode', 'Jim', 'Blair', 'escorting', 'criminal', 'train', 'only', 'have', 'Jim', 'senses', 'go', 'haywire', 'dose', 'cold', 'medicine.The', 'series', 'was', 'interesting', 'time', 'look-back', 'now']",SENTINEL: COMPLETE FIRST SEASON

Everything is tied in to the story, so we care about the characters (all the regulars, not just the stars). The stunts and explosions are integral, not just thrown in for their own sake.As I watched a few more episodes, I remembered that this kind of treatment wasn't just reserved for the pilot episode.The only problems with this set are the short (10 episodes) length of the season and the fact that the last few episodes of this first season weren't as strong as the first six or seven.

Ouellette ""ljoyce12""","[7, 7]","The ""buddy show' genre in television programming has unfortunately met its demise these days so it's refreshing to see that some of the best can live on through DVD release.  ""The Sentinel"" is among the best shows this genre had to offer.  It featured an outstanding cast which included Richard Burgi,Garrett Maggart, and Bruce A. Young.  In addition to a talented cast, ""The Sentinel"" featured intelligent police drama, high suspense, and the unique mysteries surrounding Jim's abilities as a Sentinel.  In subsequent seasons - which I hope are released on DVD soon! - Jim's role as Sentinel and Blair's role as Guide are expanded and Sentinel Mysticism factors into the plot of almost every episode.  Personally, I loved the mystical element of this series.  It made the show unique and creative, two concepts sorely lacking in the programs airing today.This DVD set is excellent, though I would like to see a full cast photo on the cover of future releases.  These ten first season episodes are outstanding for their visual quality and content. As I finished watching the set I found it difficult to not watch the rest of the series on my old worn out VHS tapes!  It was interesting to watch and I wanted to see more.  It's unfortunate that season one and two were not combined into one set.  Season Two must be released as the true essence of this program is only explored after the first ten episodes.""The Sentinel"" aired in the late 1990's on the UPN Network and quickly picked up a huge and enthusiastic fan base.  This fan base is still very much alive today and I encourage anyone who may have missed this series when it aired to pick up the Season One DVD set.
