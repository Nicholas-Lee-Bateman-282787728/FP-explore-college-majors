I don't know about anybody else's set, but mine clearly states there are bloopers but I don't have any on any of the discs. :(  Between the disc problems and the lack of features it clearly states were supposed to be included this set had me disappointed, but it was well worth the $6 still either way to watch again after all this time.For those who do buy this, if you were like me and saw an extended ending to the final episode when it aired on tv, it is included on the last disc in Special Features as the &#34;Alternate Ending&#34;.

The DVD package and DVD weren't damaged in shipping, were both in good shape, and came in a timely manner.The show itself?  Kind of a let down, really.  I've been waiting for the last two seasons of 3RFTS to come in for quite some time.  I was in high school and college when the show aired.  So I'd missed a lot of the episodes, and was especially excited to get to see the series finale.  I'd read syposes online, but most descriptions weren't very... well, descriptive.What a disappointment.  Most of the espisodes in the final two seasons lacked the whacky camaradarie you see in the first four seasons.  I'm not sure if the writers were just running out of ideas, or if the actors were tired.  But they just don't seem to have the same &#34;feel&#34; as the first four seasons.  And there seemed to be a lot holes in the story line.****SPOILER ALERT****That Dick and Mary did not stay together was not necessarily a shocker - their relationship was always a bit tumultuous - it was disappointing that they string the relationship along a further two years with no real progress, and end the series with Mary laying on the ground with the keys to the car in her hand.  The show purports that above all else, they NEVER take themselves seriously.  But as many of Dicks rash decisions were based on his love of Mary, to so swiftly agree with Mary when she gets cold feet left me wanting.  The fact that Dick never really, truly considered staying behind was equally frustrating.The same goes for Sally and Don.  The transition from them just not being able to end things with each other to an almost Casablancaian salute, &#34;I'll call ya'&#34; was swift, and unfulfilling.  After years of being on-again-off-again, I was surprised that Sally (yes, even as the Security Officer) didn't at least allude to the fact that she was an alien, or that she didn't decide to stay.  Again, I realize that they are - of a sort- minions who follow orders.  But they also showed several occaisions of rebellion.  That they so easily bowed to command was contra to their characters, I felt.The characters Harry and Tommy were always more slapstick than substance throughout the series.  They added a necessary dose of healthy &#34;stupid laughs&#34; to the show.  Additionally,  Tommy's character added the youth-perspective, as told from an elderly alien, which I found clever.  But in the final season, Tommy's absence both physically and as a character is palpable and leaves a dent in the flow of the show.  And Harry's character is just dragged along for the ride.  He becomes a shadow, ever present in the &#34;world&#34; of his shipmates but severely lacking in any substance - comedic or otherwise.If you've made it this far through the review, I thank you for your patience.  Having said ALLLL of the above, one cannot add that to NOT buy the final series if you've got the others is just asinine.  Despite it's flaws, it does wrap the series up in a little, bulgy purple, tubular package.  And besides, if you DON'T buy it you won't get to see the alternate ending that the show decided not to go with and which I found to be PERFECT (naturally).",4,Mixed Feelings,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,3178,"['product', 'was', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'package', 'DVD', 'were', ""n't"", 'damaged', 'shipping', 'were', 'good', 'shape', 'came', 'timely', 'manner.The', 'show', 'Kind', 'let', 'down', 'really', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', '3RFTS', 'come', 'quite', 'time', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'when', 'show', 'aired', ""'d"", 'missed', 'lot', 'episodes', 'was', 'especially', 'excited', 'get', 'see', 'series', 'finale', ""'d"", 'read', 'syposes', 'online', 'most', 'descriptions', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'descriptive.What', 'disappointment', 'Most', 'espisodes', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'lacked', 'whacky', 'camaradarie', 'see', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'writers', 'were', 'just', 'running', 'out', 'ideas', 'actors', 'were', 'tired', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'same', '34', 'feel', '34', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'lot', 'holes', 'story', 'line', '****SPOILER', 'ALERT****That', 'Dick', 'Mary', 'did', 'not', 'stay', 'together', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'shocker', 'relationship', 'was', 'always', 'bit', 'tumultuous', 'was', 'disappointing', 'string', 'relationship', 'further', 'two', 'years', 'real', 'progress', 'end', 'series', 'Mary', 'laying', 'ground', 'keys', 'car', 'hand', 'show', 'else', 'NEVER', 'take', 'seriously', 'many', 'Dicks', 'rash', 'decisions', 'were', 'based', 'love', 'Mary', 'so', 'swiftly', 'agree', 'Mary', 'when', 'cold', 'feet', 'left', 'wanting', 'fact', 'Dick', 'never', 'really', 'truly', 'considered', 'staying', 'behind', 'was', 'equally', 'frustrating.The', 'same', 'Sally', 'Don', 'transition', 'just', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'end', 'things', 'other', 'almost', 'Casablancaian', 'salute', '34', ""'ll"", 'call', 'ya', '34', 'was', 'swift', 'unfulfilling', 'years', 'being', 'on-again-off-again', 'was', 'surprised', 'Sally', 'yes', 'even', 'Security', 'Officer', 'did', ""n't"", 'least', 'allude', 'fact', 'was', 'alien', 'did', ""n't"", 'decide', 'stay', 'Again', 'realize', 'are', 'sort-', 'minions', 'who', 'follow', 'orders', 'also', 'showed', 'several', 'occaisions', 'rebellion', 'so', 'easily', 'bowed', 'command', 'was', 'contra', 'characters', 'felt.The', 'characters', 'Harry', 'Tommy', 'were', 'always', 'more', 'slapstick', 'substance', 'series', 'added', 'necessary', 'dose', 'healthy', '34', 'stupid', '34', 'show', 'Additionally', 'Tommy', 'character', 'added', 'youth-perspective', 'told', 'elderly', 'alien', 'found', 'clever', 'final', 'season', 'Tommy', 'absence', 'physically', 'character', 'palpable', 'dent', 'flow', 'show', 'Harry', 'character', 'just', 'dragged', 'along', 'ride', 'shadow', 'ever', 'present', '34', 'world', '34', 'shipmates', 'severely', 'lacking', 'substance', 'comedic', 'otherwise.If', ""'ve"", 'made', 'far', 'review', 'thank', 'patience', 'Having', 'said', 'ALLLL', 'above', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'add', 'NOT', 'buy', 'final', 'series', ""'ve"", 'got', 'others', 'just', 'asinine', 'flaws', 'wrap', 'series', 'up', 'little', 'bulgy', 'purple', 'tubular', 'package', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'buy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'alternate', 'ending', 'show', 'decided', 'not', 'go', 'found', 'be', 'PERFECT', 'naturally']",3rd Rock from the Sun: Season 6

I started catching episodes here and there on late night television.  I found myself laughing out loud at these so-called aliens.  This is a hilarious comedy and I now own the entire series on dvd.  I watch a few episodes atleast once a week for a good laugh.,5,3rd Rock From the Sun Season 6,1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,388,"['never', 'watched', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'actually', 'air', ""'m"", 'not', 'sci-fi', 'person', 'just', 'figured', 'would', ""n't"", 'interest', 'started', 'catching', 'episodes', 'here', 'there', 'late', 'night', 'television', 'found', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'so-called', 'aliens', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'now', 'own', 'entire', 'series', 'dvd', 'watch', 'few', 'episodes', 'atleast', 'once', 'week', 'good', 'laugh']",3rd Rock from the Sun: Season 6

Shame Mill Creek, shame. Otherwise, same, well done season sets like the rest of the series. For soms reason, the fact that they knew they were being cancelled made them even funnier than before. It's quite a memorable, relentlessly hilarious season. On the subject of the series finale.....it was quite solemn wasn't it? I mighf preferred the alternate ending. It waa sooo Dick.
