There are things I didnt like about the show, but then theres other that had me rolling on the floor with laughter.It's like a stoned mans version of Seseme street with main charactor puppets but on an adult only wave length.It's not something your grandparents would find amusing at all, it's probably P.O the religious communitys 100 times, and makes Borat look like an amatuer when there on fire.If you can stand a good laugh that is more offensive then South Park & Family Guy put together then you should check this out.season two also has a couple of episodes where the main theme is taken away and it becomes a hillbilly redneck show called Horse Apples. those where ok, but i think they where struggling for ideas when they had an entire episode of the blue interview puppet on the streets. That epsisode and another where it was purposley made to annoy you dont have any replay value for me.the second disc is like a board game with 4 episodes and the bonus features, the extras i cant say are memorable.Either way, it's still a funny show, and I cant think of what couldve made it better, but i will be looking for season 3 if there is one.",3,Not a Kids show kids show,1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,1585,"['only', 'took', 'one', 'clip', 'youtube', 'spark', 'interest', 'show', 'getting', 'season', '1', 'i', 'had', 'thoughts', 'not', 'buying', 'season', '2.Season', '2', 'more', 'offensive', 'more', 'shocking', 'more', 'outrages', 'even', 'made', 'someone', 'ask', 'did', 'really', 'just', 'say', 'tv', 'stuff', 'say', 'dont', 'think', 'even', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', 'private', 'conversation.It', 'much', 'same', 'previous', 'season', 'only', 'shock', 'value', 'been', 'tuned', 'up', 'are', 'things', 'didnt', 'show', 'then', 'other', 'had', 'rolling', 'floor', 'laughter.It', 'stoned', 'mans', 'version', 'Seseme', 'street', 'main', 'charactor', 'puppets', 'adult', 'only', 'wave', 'length.It', 'not', 'something', 'grandparents', 'would', 'find', 'amusing', 'probably', 'P.O', 'religious', 'communitys', '100', 'times', 'Borat', 'look', 'amatuer', 'when', 'fire.If', 'can', 'stand', 'good', 'laugh', 'more', 'offensive', 'then', 'South', 'Park', 'Family', 'Guy', 'put', 'together', 'then', 'should', 'check', 'out.season', 'two', 'also', 'couple', 'episodes', 'where', 'main', 'theme', 'taken', 'away', 'hillbilly', 'redneck', 'show', 'called', 'Horse', 'Apples', 'where', 'ok', 'i', 'think', 'where', 'struggling', 'ideas', 'when', 'had', 'entire', 'episode', 'blue', 'interview', 'puppet', 'streets', 'epsisode', 'where', 'was', 'purposley', 'made', 'annoy', 'dont', 'have', 'replay', 'value', 'me.the', 'second', 'disc', 'board', 'game', '4', 'episodes', 'bonus', 'features', 'extras', 'i', 'cant', 'say', 'are', 'memorable.Either', 'way', 'still', 'funny', 'show', 'cant', 'think', 'what', 'couldve', 'made', 'better', 'i', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'season', '3', 'one']",Wonder Showzen - Season Two
