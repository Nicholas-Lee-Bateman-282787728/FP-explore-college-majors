573690,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B000059MQQ,Jeffrey Leach,"[3, 5]","Welcome to Sunrise, Illinois, a town that plays host to a significant contingent of lower class, trailer dwelling, criminally prone hillbilly types loving referred to as ""Poor White Trash."" Starring such recognizable names as William Devane, Sean Young, and Jaime Pressly, the film focuses on the antics of the Bronco and Lake families, with several other individuals floating around on the periphery. Linda Bronco, played quite well by Sean Young, only has one wish in her miserable existence of one night stands and fly by night jobs: she wants her son Michael to go to college at the University of Southern Illinois to major in psychology. After yet another fight with her washed out professional wrestler husband, Linda must step in and take control of Michael's life if her dream is to be realized. Regrettably for Linda, Michael and his friend Lenny Lake find themselves in a heap of trouble after swiping a six-pack of near beer at the local convenience store. This thoughtless action throws Michael's plans for school into turmoil, thereby requiring Linda to lead her son and his friend on a robbing spree for tuition money and enough scratch to hire a decent lawyer to fight the robbery charge. Along for the ride is Brian, the son of the local sheriff who Linda picked up in a bar and who now wishes to take part in the antics.To disentangle her son from the robbery charge, Linda and her son turn to Lenny Lake's grandfather, Ron Lake. The elder Lake is a strange character, a one-time felon who now works as a big shot lawyer. Ron just married the gorgeous but dangerous Sandy, and the two live in Ron's trailer adorned with a garden of sculptures made out of beer cans. Ron is as crooked as they come, though, and to get his help Linda and her trio of would be criminals must agree to split their take with Ron and his wife. Everything goes down the drain from this point, as the four rob a retirement home and a local eating establishment. They get the money, but they get double crossed too, an incident which leads to hilarious trailer trash retribution involving trailer stealing, fireworks, automatic weapons, and duct tape.There are more problems with ""Poor White Trash"" than there are pluses. The organization of the film is a disaster, with scenes that run too long, sloppy camera work, and a script often bogged down with too much detritus. What this movie desperately needed was an excellent editor, someone to go through the scenes and cut out all the awkward dead weight. About half way into the movie, I started to suspect that somebody, maybe a studio, mucked around with the finished product and left us with a movie that is more often a hodgepodge of scenes than a seamless film. Another big minus here, at least for me, was the relegation of Danielle Harris to a minor role as Suzi (the one with an ""i""), an employee at the local restaurant robbed by Bronco and company. Harris, who in my opinion could never appear in enough films, gets marginal screen time. At least we get one good shot of her smiling face, and I guess that is better than nothing.Despite these problems, ""Poor White Trash"" works on many levels, and works spectacularly. I would be completely insane if I did not mention the stellar performance of William Devane as Ron Lake. I have never liked Devane as an actor, probably due to his appearance in too many of those unctuous ""movie of the week"" productions. But here he shines like the sun. Devane has all of the best lines of the film, none of which are reproducible here because they usually deal with romantic entanglements in prison. His outfits are hilarious, his law office, located in a mall, bears the name ""Land o' Law,"" and his philosophy about beautiful women is a scream. Devane chews the scenery in this film and it is a better movie because of it. Devane's role along with numerous effective sight gags, helps propel ""Poor White Trash"" to easily watchable levels.The DVD throws in a commentary by Sean Young and director Michael Addis, as well as some production stills, three trailers for three obscure films I never heard of, and cast and crew profiles. Add in these extras with the actual film, and you have yourself an effective way to burn a few hours. ""Poor White Trash"" will never win any awards, but it ultimately delivers with good performances and some good gags.",3,Lots of Problems but Lots of Laughs,1056931200,"06 30, 2003",2003,4338,"['Welcome', 'Sunrise', 'Illinois', 'town', 'host', 'significant', 'contingent', 'lower', 'class', 'trailer', 'dwelling', 'criminally', 'prone', 'hillbilly', 'loving', 'referred', 'Poor', 'White', 'Trash', 'Starring', 'such', 'recognizable', 'names', 'William', 'Devane', 'Sean', 'Young', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'film', 'antics', 'Bronco', 'Lake', 'families', 'several', 'other', 'individuals', 'floating', 'around', 'periphery', 'Linda', 'Bronco', 'played', 'quite', 'well', 'Sean', 'Young', 'only', 'one', 'wish', 'miserable', 'existence', 'one', 'night', 'stands', 'fly', 'night', 'jobs', 'son', 'Michael', 'go', 'college', 'University', 'Southern', 'Illinois', 'major', 'psychology', 'yet', 'fight', 'washed', 'out', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'husband', 'Linda', 'must', 'step', 'take', 'control', 'Michael', 'life', 'dream', 'be', 'realized', 'Regrettably', 'Linda', 'Michael', 'friend', 'Lenny', 'Lake', 'find', 'heap', 'trouble', 'swiping', 'six-pack', 'near', 'beer', 'local', 'convenience', 'store', 'thoughtless', 'action', 'Michael', 'plans', 'school', 'turmoil', 'thereby', 'requiring', 'Linda', 'lead', 'son', 'friend', 'robbing', 'spree', 'tuition', 'money', 'enough', 'scratch', 'hire', 'decent', 'lawyer', 'fight', 'robbery', 'charge', 'ride', 'Brian', 'son', 'local', 'sheriff', 'who', 'Linda', 'picked', 'up', 'bar', 'who', 'now', 'take', 'part', 'antics.To', 'son', 'robbery', 'charge', 'Linda', 'son', 'turn', 'Lenny', 'Lake', 'grandfather', 'Ron', 'Lake', 'elder', 'Lake', 'strange', 'character', 'one-time', 'felon', 'who', 'now', 'big', 'shot', 'lawyer', 'Ron', 'just', 'married', 'gorgeous', 'dangerous', 'Sandy', 'two', 'live', 'Ron', 'trailer', 'adorned', 'garden', 'sculptures', 'made', 'beer', 'cans', 'Ron', 'as', 'crooked', 'come', 'get', 'help', 'Linda', 'trio', 'would', 'be', 'criminals', 'must', 'agree', 'split', 'take', 'Ron', 'wife', 'Everything', 'down', 'drain', 'point', 'four', 'rob', 'retirement', 'home', 'local', 'eating', 'establishment', 'get', 'money', 'get', 'double', 'crossed', 'too', 'incident', 'hilarious', 'trailer', 'trash', 'retribution', 'involving', 'trailer', 'stealing', 'fireworks', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'duct', 'are', 'more', 'problems', 'Poor', 'White', 'Trash', 'are', 'pluses', 'organization', 'film', 'disaster', 'scenes', 'run', 'too', 'long', 'sloppy', 'camera', 'work', 'script', 'often', 'bogged', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'detritus', 'What', 'movie', 'desperately', 'needed', 'was', 'excellent', 'editor', 'someone', 'go', 'scenes', 'cut', 'out', 'awkward', 'dead', 'weight', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'started', 'suspect', 'somebody', 'maybe', 'studio', 'mucked', 'finished', 'product', 'left', 'movie', 'more', 'often', 'hodgepodge', 'scenes', 'seamless', 'film', 'big', 'minus', 'here', 'least', 'was', 'relegation', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'minor', 'role', 'Suzi', 'one', 'i', 'employee', 'local', 'restaurant', 'robbed', 'Bronco', 'company', 'Harris', 'who', 'opinion', 'could', 'never', 'appear', 'enough', 'films', 'marginal', 'screen', 'time', 'least', 'get', 'one', 'good', 'shot', 'smiling', 'face', 'guess', 'better', 'nothing.Despite', 'problems', 'Poor', 'White', 'Trash', 'many', 'levels', 'spectacularly', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'insane', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'stellar', 'performance', 'William', 'Devane', 'Ron', 'Lake', 'have', 'never', 'liked', 'Devane', 'actor', 'probably', 'due', 'appearance', 'too', 'many', 'unctuous', 'movie', 'week', 'productions', 'here', 'sun', 'Devane', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'none', 'are', 'reproducible', 'here', 'usually', 'deal', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'prison', 'outfits', 'are', 'hilarious', 'law', 'office', 'located', 'mall', 'name', 'Land', 'o', 'Law', 'philosophy', 'beautiful', 'women', 'scream', 'Devane', 'scenery', 'film', 'better', 'movie', 'Devane', 'role', 'numerous', 'effective', 'sight', 'gags', 'propel', 'Poor', 'White', 'Trash', 'easily', 'watchable', 'levels.The', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Sean', 'Young', 'director', 'Michael', 'Addis', 'as', 'well', 'production', 'stills', 'three', 'trailers', 'three', 'obscure', 'films', 'never', 'heard', 'cast', 'crew', 'profiles', 'Add', 'extras', 'actual', 'film', 'have', 'effective', 'way', 'burn', 'few', 'hours', 'Poor', 'White', 'Trash', 'will', 'never', 'win', 'awards', 'ultimately', 'good', 'performances', 'good', 'gags']",Poor White Trash

573694,AOK72ELBI86GF,B000059MQQ,Poker Face,"[5, 7]","I'd give the movie 3 stars on it's own, but due to the refreshing criticism by both Sean Young and the writer/director on the single commentary track, I'm adding an extra star to the overall grade.This movie suffers from absolutely awful cinematography (Dir. of Photog.'s first film). Although, because this is a movie about poor white trash, it is almost fitting. Regardless, I still enjoyed the movie right from the very beginning.However, to help get you into the right mood to watch this movie, I would suggest that you listen to a bit of the Sean Young and writer/director's commentary track, before you begin watching, so that you can hear how relaxed and frank the two of them are. They are having fun eating and drinking while they do the commentary (eventually, you hear bottles being opened, etc.). In less than a minute you should be relaxed, so just jump back to the beginning of the movie and watch it without the commentary (the first time).In the commentary track, both the director and Sean Young quite often comment on the bad lighting and low budget they had to put up with, and I was shocked to hear Sean Young talk about how Jason London didn't get along with her, and how he basically berated her on the set. She also criticized the cinematographer (his first film) and the director, in a friendly, yet, educational way. I found it to be both entertaining and informative.One great side effect about having a low budget, is that you often have just one take to do most of the scenes. This allows for the inclusion of many scenes that include actor errors or mishaps that would normally be edited out or reshot. One such great scene occurs when Jaime Pressly is trashing a hospital room. Shortly after she kicks a small television across the room, she loses her balance after bumping into a table, slips, and then takes a hard fall. Without missing a beat, she gets up immediately and continues on with the scene. Both Sean and the director get a nice laugh out of it, on the commentary track.I also believe that if this Dvd was handed out for free, to 100 random people in a major city, 80 of them would probably stop watching it after 20 minutes or less. Ten of them would just fast forward scan to see all of Jaimie Pressly's scenes, and the final ten people would enjoy it as much as the majority of the Amazon reviewers here seem to.I think the low budget look to the movie would turn most people off. It also takes awhile until the entertaining William Devane or Jaime Pressly appear (no, Jaime is never naked-a bikini is as close as she gets). Also, surprisingly, there's no nudity at all in the film- just one very partial side breast of a girl is quickly shown, but nothing else I remember.So, even though there's probably a 60%-80% chance you won't want to watch the whole movie, or even bother listening to the commentary track, I would still suggest that you at least rent it, to see if it becomes one of your guilty pleasures. It's certainly one of mine.Like one of the menu choices on the Dvd states...""Play the Damn Movie"".See ya at the trailer park!",4,I found Sean Young's commentary track very refreshing...and I liked the movie too.,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,3085,"[""'d"", 'give', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'own', 'due', 'refreshing', 'criticism', 'Sean', 'Young', 'writer/director', 'single', 'commentary', 'track', ""'m"", 'adding', 'extra', 'star', 'overall', 'grade.This', 'movie', 'suffers', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'cinematography', 'Dir', 'Photog', 'first', 'film', 'movie', 'poor', 'white', 'trash', 'almost', 'fitting', 'Regardless', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'right', 'very', 'beginning.However', 'help', 'get', 'right', 'mood', 'watch', 'movie', 'would', 'suggest', 'listen', 'bit', 'Sean', 'Young', 'writer/director', 'commentary', 'track', 'begin', 'watching', 'can', 'hear', 'how', 'relaxed', 'frank', 'two', 'are', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'eating', 'drinking', 'do', 'commentary', 'eventually', 'hear', 'bottles', 'being', 'opened', 'etc.', 'less', 'minute', 'should', 'be', 'relaxed', 'so', 'just', 'jump', 'back', 'beginning', 'movie', 'watch', 'commentary', 'first', 'time', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Sean', 'Young', 'quite', 'often', 'comment', 'bad', 'lighting', 'low', 'budget', 'had', 'put', 'up', 'was', 'shocked', 'hear', 'Sean', 'Young', 'talk', 'how', 'Jason', 'London', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'how', 'basically', 'berated', 'set', 'also', 'criticized', 'cinematographer', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'friendly', 'yet', 'educational', 'way', 'found', 'be', 'entertaining', 'informative.One', 'great', 'side', 'effect', 'having', 'low', 'budget', 'often', 'have', 'just', 'one', 'take', 'do', 'most', 'scenes', 'inclusion', 'many', 'scenes', 'include', 'actor', 'errors', 'mishaps', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'edited', 'out', 'reshot', 'One', 'such', 'great', 'scene', 'when', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'trashing', 'hospital', 'room', 'Shortly', 'small', 'television', 'room', 'balance', 'bumping', 'table', 'slips', 'then', 'hard', 'fall', 'missing', 'beat', 'up', 'immediately', 'scene', 'Sean', 'director', 'get', 'nice', 'laugh', 'commentary', 'track.I', 'also', 'believe', 'Dvd', 'was', 'handed', 'out', 'free', '100', 'random', 'people', 'major', 'city', '80', 'would', 'probably', 'stop', 'watching', '20', 'minutes', 'less', 'Ten', 'would', 'just', 'fast', 'forward', 'scan', 'see', 'Jaimie', 'Pressly', 'scenes', 'final', 'ten', 'people', 'would', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'majority', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'here', 'seem', 'to.I', 'think', 'low', 'budget', 'look', 'movie', 'would', 'turn', 'most', 'people', 'off', 'also', 'awhile', 'entertaining', 'William', 'Devane', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'appear', 'Jaime', 'never', 'naked-a', 'bikini', 'as', 'close', 'Also', 'surprisingly', 'nudity', 'film-', 'just', 'one', 'very', 'partial', 'side', 'breast', 'girl', 'quickly', 'shown', 'nothing', 'else', 'remember.So', 'even', 'probably', '60', '%', '-80', '%', 'chance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie', 'even', 'bother', 'listening', 'commentary', 'track', 'would', 'still', 'suggest', 'least', 'rent', 'see', 'one', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'certainly', 'one', 'mine.Like', 'one', 'menu', 'choices', 'Dvd', 'states', 'Play', 'Damn', 'Movie', '.See', 'ya', 'trailer', 'park']",Poor White Trash
