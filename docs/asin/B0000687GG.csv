704268,ARIDN94LOCQFD,B0000687GG,Steve Taylor,"[5, 15]","Jerry Jenkins ought to be ashamed. He states in an interview on this DVD that he started a movie company because he thought this was such a good story that it needed to be told. First and foremost it's a terrible movie, Christian or secular it's just plain bad. The script stinks, the characters are unlikable and weak, the directing and editing is high school quality and most of the acting is pathetic. As for it being a ""Christian"" movie you've got to be kidding me. Why? Because there's no cussing? Is that what makes it Christian? The gospel is not portrayed in any way, shape or form. In fact the way I see it it's unbiblical. We even have the main character who doesn't really profess to be a Christian but since she mentions god we assume that she must be (in fact Jesus is never mentioned in the movie) she ends up dating an openly unbelieving boy. Is that the ""Christian"" message we want to send our kids? From now on if Jerry Jerkin's name is on a movie I'm not watching it. This movie robbed two hours of my life I'll never get back.
