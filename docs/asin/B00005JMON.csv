620545,A2TLEB18074L4S,B00005JMON,Alexander Leach,"[1, 2]","Having been disappointed with Allen's most recent efforts (I couldn't even get through `Hollywood Ending'), this was a really pleasant surprise.  I suppose it can be classed as a comedy drama, like many of Allen's films - and here the two elements are cleanly divided as the story unfolds of young comedy writer Jerry Falk (American Pie's Jason Biggs) and his beautiful but flakey girlfriend Amanda (Christina Ricci).  They provide most of the drama, while Allen as Jerry's pal and svengali David Dobell provides the comedy as he passes on esoteric advice and commentary intermittently during their walks in Central Park.One strange facet of Allen's character here is that apart from being erudite and well-read, he is also supposed to suffer from a slight mental illness: Allen's portrayal is strangely endearing in this regard, although whether this is deliberate and subtle acting I'm not too sure.  Perhaps he will now appear slightly eccentric in all his future performances.In fact this device is just a way for Allen to carry out his usual trick of giving himself the best lines which occasionally have a surreal element - and which are generally very funny, so it's good to see Allen's comedic skills haven't deserted him.  It's also refreshing to find he has finally given up on using himself as the romantic interest and passed that torch onto younger cast members.I got the feeling that Allen has turned a corner with this film, hopefully heralding an Indian Summer for him.  A couple of small things make it notable: first, it was shot in 2.35:1 widescreen (the first genuine widescreen Allen film since Manhattan), second, it is the first film in which Allen's age is specified in the script - Jerry describes him in the first five minutes as being 60, a slight understatement, but hey, at least it's something.  Maybe this age-reference is significant, but I do know that Allen looks incredibly young in this film: apart fom hair transplants has he had any nips and tucks?  He looks younger than in Annie Hall in some close-ups, which is rather strange.There are also strange references and homages to earlier films: Dobell drives around in a sports car (here bright red) which is identical to that bought by Michael Murphy in Manhattan, while Jerry arranges a `chance' meeting with Amanda rather as Michael Caine's character does with Barbara Hershey in Hannah And Her Sisters.The three principals essentially have the film to themselves: Stockard Channing as Amanda's boozy mother appear only briefly, so while Ricci's and Allen's performances are spot-on, I have a few doubts about Jason Biggs.  Most of the time he is very believable and pleasing as a young comedy writer but occasionally his inexperience can surface when his timing is a little off and he seems to be reciting the lines rather than delivering them conversationally.  Anything Else has been describes as Annie Hall II - and while it's not in that film's class, it does take you on a journey which leaves you feeling satisfied as the credits roll.  I really recommend this one for Allen fans.DVD-wise, this is a good release as all Allen's films tend to be.  The 2.35:1 image is superb: crisp and sharp with no artefacts or edge enhancements.  The usual Allen green-brown palette for clothes and furnishings is leavened occasionally by bright colours: Allen's scarlet shirt in an early scene is rock-solid with no bleeding.  One sequence where Jerry spies on Amanda at dusk portrays the light very accurately, with no grain at all.  This is a top notch transfer.  As for sound, this is Allen's usual mono soundtrack, with all the dialogue coming crisply from the centre speaker and ambient jazz occasionally using the other fronts.  No action from the rear speakers, but there's no need for them in this film at all.  So a very nice soundtrack indeed.  The disc also has a welcome first, a DVD extra which (incredibly) actually has some input from the writer/director: it's only a production note on a few screens, but we do get some quotes from Biggs and Ricci - as well as Allen himself giving information about the casting process.",4,A welcome return to form after some duds,1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,4118,"['Having', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Allen', 'most', 'recent', 'efforts', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'Hollywood', 'Ending', 'was', 'really', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'suppose', 'can', 'be', 'classed', 'comedy', 'drama', 'many', 'Allen', 'films', 'here', 'two', 'elements', 'are', 'cleanly', 'divided', 'story', 'unfolds', 'young', 'comedy', 'writer', 'Jerry', 'Falk', 'American', 'Pie', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'beautiful', 'flakey', 'girlfriend', 'Amanda', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'provide', 'most', 'drama', 'Allen', 'Jerry', 'pal', 'svengali', 'David', 'Dobell', 'comedy', 'esoteric', 'advice', 'commentary', 'intermittently', 'walks', 'Central', 'Park.One', 'strange', 'facet', 'Allen', 'character', 'here', 'apart', 'being', 'erudite', 'well-read', 'also', 'supposed', 'suffer', 'slight', 'mental', 'illness', 'Allen', 'portrayal', 'strangely', 'endearing', 'regard', 'deliberate', 'subtle', 'acting', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'now', 'appear', 'slightly', 'eccentric', 'future', 'performances.In', 'fact', 'device', 'just', 'way', 'Allen', 'carry', 'out', 'usual', 'trick', 'giving', 'best', 'lines', 'occasionally', 'have', 'surreal', 'element', 'are', 'generally', 'very', 'funny', 'good', 'see', 'Allen', 'comedic', 'skills', 'have', ""n't"", 'deserted', 'also', 'refreshing', 'find', 'finally', 'given', 'up', 'using', 'romantic', 'interest', 'passed', 'torch', 'younger', 'cast', 'members.I', 'got', 'feeling', 'Allen', 'turned', 'corner', 'film', 'hopefully', 'heralding', 'Indian', 'Summer', 'couple', 'small', 'things', 'make', 'notable', 'first', 'was', 'shot', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'first', 'genuine', 'widescreen', 'Allen', 'film', 'Manhattan', 'second', 'first', 'film', 'Allen', 'age', 'specified', 'script', 'Jerry', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'being', '60', 'slight', 'understatement', 'hey', 'least', 'something', 'Maybe', 'age-reference', 'significant', 'do', 'know', 'Allen', 'incredibly', 'young', 'film', 'apart', 'hair', 'transplants', 'had', 'nips', 'tucks', 'younger', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'close-ups', 'rather', 'are', 'also', 'strange', 'references', 'homages', 'earlier', 'films', 'Dobell', 'around', 'sports', 'car', 'here', 'bright', 'red', 'identical', 'bought', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'Manhattan', 'Jerry', 'chance', 'meeting', 'Amanda', 'rather', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'character', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Hannah', 'Her', 'Sisters.The', 'three', 'principals', 'essentially', 'have', 'film', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Amanda', 'boozy', 'mother', 'only', 'briefly', 'so', 'Ricci', 'Allen', 'performances', 'are', 'spot-on', 'have', 'few', 'doubts', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'Most', 'time', 'very', 'believable', 'pleasing', 'young', 'comedy', 'writer', 'occasionally', 'inexperience', 'can', 'surface', 'when', 'timing', 'little', 'off', 'be', 'reciting', 'lines', 'rather', 'delivering', 'conversationally', 'Anything', 'Else', 'been', 'describes', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'II', 'not', 'film', 'class', 'take', 'journey', 'feeling', 'satisfied', 'credits', 'roll', 'really', 'recommend', 'one', 'Allen', 'fans.DVD-wise', 'good', 'release', 'Allen', 'films', 'tend', 'be', '2.35:1', 'image', 'superb', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'artefacts', 'edge', 'enhancements', 'usual', 'Allen', 'green-brown', 'palette', 'clothes', 'furnishings', 'leavened', 'occasionally', 'bright', 'colours', 'Allen', 'scarlet', 'shirt', 'early', 'scene', 'rock-solid', 'bleeding', 'One', 'sequence', 'where', 'Jerry', 'Amanda', 'dusk', 'light', 'very', 'accurately', 'grain', 'top', 'notch', 'transfer', 'sound', 'Allen', 'usual', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'dialogue', 'coming', 'crisply', 'centre', 'speaker', 'ambient', 'jazz', 'occasionally', 'using', 'other', 'fronts', 'action', 'rear', 'speakers', 'need', 'film', 'very', 'nice', 'soundtrack', 'indeed', 'disc', 'also', 'welcome', 'first', 'DVD', 'extra', 'incredibly', 'actually', 'input', 'writer/director', 'only', 'production', 'note', 'few', 'screens', 'do', 'get', 'quotes', 'Biggs', 'Ricci', 'as', 'well', 'Allen', 'giving', 'information', 'casting', 'process']",N/A
620546,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JMON,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","In this seemingly endless review of Woody Allen's work that I have undertaken over the past year or so I have noted in some reviews that the legendary comic, actor, writer, director and producer has on occasion repeated himself. I have also noted that if one lives long enough (and is productive enough) that is bound to occur. That is the case with Anything Else but where previously the repeated intellectual banter and sight gags were tiresome this little 2003 film was rather refreshing.For starters the premise here is more interesting.  Kind of Woody Redux. Woody is playing the comedic elder statesmen (himself, in other words) that has seen more than his share of the world and his oddly-nuanced view of it (including some satanic digs at survivalists, rabid uncritical Jewish Israel-supporters, Jew-hating Nazi-types and the pretensions of the intellectual world).  He has befriended a rising up-and-coming comedic talent that has all of Wood's early tics-you know, insecurity, troubles with women, self-induced manias, troubles with women, panic attacks, troubles with women (in other words, himself)....you get the drift . They collectively attempt throughout the film to break out from that old Woody as they seize on Woody's idea to break totally with their pasts and go to work in ......L.A. That's the ticket, right?Along the way Jerry (Woody's younger self) falls in and out of love with a neurotic young beauty (the fetching Amanda played by Christiana Ricci), falls in and out of his relationship with his business agent (played by Danny Devito) and with his shrink. Hey, Jerry is more than ready to go to Hollywood after all that. In any case, put Woody (young and old), a New York City (actually Manhattan) locale, New York Jewish intellectual humor and a bonus of Billie Holiday doing Cole Porter tunes as background music and you have a very nice little film for us aging 1960's-type Woody aficionados.

620547,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005JMON,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 8]","Like The Rolling Stones, interminably imitating themselves, Woody Allen has been recycling schtick for so long viewers feel they've seen his movies twice before he makes them.  On one hand, there's no harm in this, it's comforting to watch the old, neurotic vaudevillian wind up the Victrola yet again.  On the other hand, when you go to the Xerox machine and make a copy of a copy of a copy, the end result may be unintelligible.Ostensibly a film about change, Anything Else is actually a study in stasis.  There's plenty of snappy patter, a few zingers, and enough Dostoevsky references to satisfy intellectual elitists, but ultimately - this dog don't hunt.  As writer and director, the blame belongs to Allen, and the lion's share of it goes to the character of Jerry Falk, Jason Biggs, which Allen himself would have played twenty years ago.Jason Biggs, looking like he was carved out of balsa wood, tries unsuccessfully to pass off smiling for acting.  As Falk he is dumb, bland, identity-less, ridiculously forgiving, and funny not.  Jerry is devoid of the comedy writer's requisite elements: anger, fiery wit, irreverence, pain, deep sorrow, and profound hunger for approval.  In Dobel, Allen, we see these qualities mellowed into delusional, paranoid alta-cocker-itude, and Dobel gets off some characteristically funny/gloomy lines.  Unfortunately, they exist in a vacuum.Christina Ricci, as Amanda, is well cast and delivers, but her character is so two-dimensional, if it turned sideways it would disappear.  The moment she meets Jerry it's obvious she's trouble, as the film ends she is simply starting her familiar pattern anew.Stockard Channing brings energy and credible craziness to every scene she's in, while Danny DeVito is so good he almost saves the picture.  (Aficionados may want to compare the DeVito character, a loser talent agent with one, horrible client - to Broadway Danny Rose, a loser talent agent specializing in acts nobody else would have.  The difference, of course, is that BDR is a gem, one of Allen's very best.)For an Allen movie worth owning, try Radio Days.",2,Would Have Been Preferable,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,2099,"['Rolling', 'Stones', 'interminably', 'imitating', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'been', 'recycling', 'schtick', 'so', 'long', 'viewers', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'twice', 'one', 'hand', 'harm', 'comforting', 'watch', 'old', 'neurotic', 'vaudevillian', 'wind', 'Victrola', 'yet', 'again', 'other', 'hand', 'when', 'go', 'Xerox', 'machine', 'make', 'copy', 'copy', 'copy', 'end', 'result', 'may', 'be', 'unintelligible.Ostensibly', 'film', 'change', 'Anything', 'Else', 'actually', 'study', 'stasis', 'plenty', 'snappy', 'patter', 'few', 'zingers', 'enough', 'Dostoevsky', 'references', 'satisfy', 'intellectual', 'elitists', 'ultimately', 'dog', 'do', ""n't"", 'hunt', 'writer', 'director', 'blame', 'Allen', 'lion', 'share', 'character', 'Jerry', 'Falk', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'Allen', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago.Jason', 'Biggs', 'looking', 'was', 'carved', 'balsa', 'wood', 'unsuccessfully', 'pass', 'off', 'smiling', 'acting', 'Falk', 'dumb', 'bland', 'identity-less', 'ridiculously', 'forgiving', 'funny', 'not', 'Jerry', 'devoid', 'comedy', 'writer', 'requisite', 'elements', 'anger', 'fiery', 'wit', 'irreverence', 'pain', 'deep', 'sorrow', 'profound', 'hunger', 'approval', 'Dobel', 'Allen', 'see', 'qualities', 'mellowed', 'delusional', 'paranoid', 'alta-cocker-itude', 'Dobel', 'off', 'characteristically', 'funny/gloomy', 'lines', 'Unfortunately', 'exist', 'vacuum.Christina', 'Ricci', 'Amanda', 'well', 'cast', 'delivers', 'character', 'so', 'two-dimensional', 'turned', 'would', 'disappear', 'moment', 'Jerry', 'obvious', 'trouble', 'film', 'simply', 'starting', 'familiar', 'pattern', 'Channing', 'brings', 'energy', 'credible', 'craziness', 'scene', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'so', 'good', 'almost', 'picture', 'Aficionados', 'may', 'want', 'compare', 'DeVito', 'character', 'loser', 'talent', 'agent', 'one', 'horrible', 'client', 'Broadway', 'Danny', 'Rose', 'loser', 'talent', 'agent', 'specializing', 'acts', 'nobody', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'difference', 'course', 'BDR', 'gem', 'one', 'Allen', 'very', 'best', 'Allen', 'movie', 'worth', 'owning', 'try', 'Radio', 'Days']",N/A
620548,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,B00005JMON,audrey,"[8, 8]","An interesting thing happened while I was watching this film.  My husband and I are both devoted fans of Woody Allen, and have been for many years.  We started out watching the movie on a Friday night and about halfway through both of us said --This is not too good.  Let's go to bed.The next morning I woke up and, not wanting to wake him, watched the rest of the film with the subtitles on -- and it was hysterical.  I was laughing aloud over and over, and finally went back to the beginning and watched using the subtiles and found that funny as well!  So, while I'd thought the movie was rotten, it turns out it should have been a book or it just needed a different cast.  Jason Biggs was inconsistent -- sometimes he did well, but at other times delivered his lines in such a wooden fashion that it seemed like a joke.  Still, you have to allow that this is how Woody Allen sees himself as a young man.  A bigger problem is Christina Ricci, who I really like usually, but she did not work in this part at all.  Finally, and most surprising to my mind, Woody Allen was not that funny, though his lines were fantastic.  Danny DeVito and Stockard Channing were fine but their parts were small.  Jimmy Fallon, great on SNL, has a small part and is totally underwhelming here.The script is wonderful, and shows Woody as older neurotic passing his wisdom on to a younger neurotic, addressing his favorite issues of therapy, sex, love, violence, anti-Semitism (from the point-of-view of a paranoid Jew intent on assembling his own survival kit) and work.DVD extras are minimal and include cast & crew info as well as production notes.

620549,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005JMON,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 1]","I am a devoted fan of Woody Allen's movies, and I am prepared to believe his films, even his very best, are not to everyone's tastes. What a predisposition to like Allen's movies buys me is the willingness to give this movie a second chance if it does not appeal to me on first viewing. And, I can honestly say that this movie has one of the very best qualities of any movie, in that it actually improves as you watch it for a second and third time.Since Allen is famous for doing parodies of major dramatic genres, from 1930s German impressionism of `Shadows and Fog' to Renaissance fantasy in `A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy', so my first reaction to this movie was that it too was primarily a parody of modern light comedy, but it is not. The saying about taking coals to Newcastle comes to mind. Another first reaction was that many of the situations seemed a bit improbable. But then, I remembered situations in recent popular comedies where a 13 year old becomes 30 years old overnight, a mother and daughter switch bodies, and a very overweight black professor becomes very trim and obnoxious. All these movies are very funny, but they are also based on literally impossible situations. So what was I complaining about if it seems a bit improbable for a 60 year old high school teacher with a giant vocabulary and a history of psychotic violence is trying to break into the standup comedy joke writing profession.This last description is a sketch of Woody Allen's character in this movie that, unlike almost all of his others where he has a role, is not the lead character. Rather, it supports the lead played by Jason Biggs who shares the spotlight with fellow teenage character specialist, Christina Ricci. Neither of these actors is drawn from Allen's usual pool of actors, since none of his usual late middle aged colleagues would have a chance at playing the 21-year-old characters. I have seen neither Biggs nor Ricci in any of their other movies, but I believe that they succeed very well here at playing largely innocent, unreflective young adults who do not yet have their lives nailed down to a solid foundation.Biggs young gag writer character is being advised in several different directions by his nebbish agent, played with gusto as usual by Danny DeVito, his psychiatrist, and by Allen's character, whose advice usually wins out. The main action of the story is the young man's inability to be alone, leading him to fall in love with the immature siren Christina Ricci character, who is as disorganized with maintaining her emotional attachments as she is in managing her time, money, or mother. Most of the humor is generated by the goings on between these two characters, but great grins are also created by the really terrific performance by Stockard Channing as Ricci's mother.In a sense, Biggs is playing Woody Allen of 40 years ago, as he appears in `Take the Money and Run', but without Allen's psychotic mischieviousness, as when Allen directs a parking driver to violently back into a parked car's headlights. Allen the writer reserves that grim humor for Allen the actor's character, especially when he smashes in the headlights and windshields of a car driven by two very heavily built young men who just stole a parking space from Allan's fire engine red Porsche.`anything else', to my mind, is neither Allen's best or worst comedy, but it may be one of his best which combines comedy with serious, realistic human interaction. There is none of the fantasy hijinks of `Mighty Aphrodite' with its Greek chorus or even the Academy awarded `Annie Hall' with deux ex machina appearances of celebrities from behind movie cutouts. The only unusual device used in this movie is the Biggs' charter speaking directly to the audience, as if the audience was the only character in the room that really understands him. At least, it is the only character who can't talk back.I agree with some other reviewers that Biggs and Ricci are not up to the quality of acting from veterans Channing and DeVito, but I thing their weak acting skills plays into their characters, who are not exactly strong people themselves, except that Biggs manages in the end to resolve his situation and free himself from immediate conflicts, with a little help from Woody's character.As a comedy, this movie is a lot easier to take and to like than the dramatic `Husbands and Wives' or `Crimes and Misdemeanors', but it is more challanging than the comedies with easy gimmicks. Not quite as good as `Annie Hall' or `Manhattan', but well worth the viewing.",4,"Not Vintage Woodman, but durable fun for Allan fans",1092700800,"08 17, 2004",2004,4553,"['am', 'devoted', 'fan', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'am', 'prepared', 'believe', 'films', 'even', 'very', 'best', 'are', 'not', 'everyone', 'tastes', 'What', 'predisposition', 'like', 'Allen', 'movies', 'willingness', 'give', 'movie', 'second', 'chance', 'not', 'appeal', 'first', 'viewing', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'movie', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'qualities', 'movie', 'actually', 'watch', 'second', 'third', 'time.Since', 'Allen', 'famous', 'doing', 'parodies', 'major', 'dramatic', 'genres', '1930s', 'German', 'impressionism', 'Shadows', 'Fog', 'Renaissance', 'fantasy', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Sex', 'Comedy', 'first', 'reaction', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'was', 'primarily', 'parody', 'modern', 'light', 'comedy', 'not', 'saying', 'taking', 'coals', 'Newcastle', 'mind', 'first', 'reaction', 'was', 'many', 'situations', 'seemed', 'bit', 'improbable', 'then', 'remembered', 'situations', 'recent', 'popular', 'comedies', 'where', '13', 'year', 'old', '30', 'years', 'old', 'overnight', 'mother', 'daughter', 'switch', 'bodies', 'very', 'overweight', 'black', 'professor', 'very', 'trim', 'obnoxious', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'are', 'also', 'based', 'literally', 'impossible', 'situations', 'what', 'was', 'complaining', 'bit', 'improbable', '60', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'giant', 'vocabulary', 'history', 'psychotic', 'violence', 'trying', 'break', 'standup', 'comedy', 'joke', 'writing', 'profession.This', 'last', 'description', 'sketch', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'movie', 'almost', 'others', 'where', 'role', 'not', 'lead', 'character', 'Rather', 'lead', 'played', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'who', 'shares', 'spotlight', 'fellow', 'teenage', 'character', 'specialist', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'actors', 'drawn', 'Allen', 'usual', 'pool', 'actors', 'none', 'usual', 'late', 'middle', 'aged', 'colleagues', 'would', 'have', 'chance', 'playing', '21-year-old', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'Biggs', 'Ricci', 'other', 'movies', 'believe', 'succeed', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'playing', 'largely', 'innocent', 'unreflective', 'young', 'adults', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'yet', 'have', 'lives', 'nailed', 'down', 'solid', 'foundation.Biggs', 'young', 'gag', 'writer', 'character', 'being', 'advised', 'several', 'different', 'directions', 'nebbish', 'agent', 'played', 'gusto', 'usual', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'psychiatrist', 'Allen', 'character', 'advice', 'usually', 'out', 'main', 'action', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'inability', 'be', 'alone', 'leading', 'fall', 'love', 'immature', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'character', 'who', 'disorganized', 'maintaining', 'emotional', 'attachments', 'managing', 'time', 'money', 'mother', 'Most', 'humor', 'generated', 'goings', 'two', 'characters', 'great', 'grins', 'are', 'also', 'created', 'really', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Ricci', 'mother.In', 'sense', 'Biggs', 'playing', 'Woody', 'Allen', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'Take', 'Money', 'Run', 'Allen', 'psychotic', 'mischieviousness', 'when', 'Allen', 'parking', 'driver', 'violently', 'back', 'parked', 'car', 'headlights', 'Allen', 'writer', 'reserves', 'grim', 'humor', 'Allen', 'actor', 'character', 'especially', 'when', 'headlights', 'windshields', 'car', 'driven', 'two', 'very', 'heavily', 'built', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'just', 'stole', 'parking', 'space', 'Allan', 'fire', 'engine', 'red', 'Porsche.', 'anything', 'else', 'mind', 'Allen', 'best', 'worst', 'comedy', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'comedy', 'serious', 'realistic', 'human', 'interaction', 'none', 'fantasy', 'hijinks', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'even', 'Academy', 'awarded', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'deux', 'ex', 'machina', 'appearances', 'celebrities', 'movie', 'cutouts', 'only', 'unusual', 'device', 'used', 'movie', 'Biggs', 'charter', 'speaking', 'directly', 'audience', 'audience', 'was', 'only', 'character', 'room', 'really', 'least', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'back.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Biggs', 'Ricci', 'are', 'not', 'quality', 'acting', 'veterans', 'Channing', 'DeVito', 'thing', 'weak', 'acting', 'skills', 'plays', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'strong', 'people', 'Biggs', 'end', 'resolve', 'situation', 'free', 'immediate', 'conflicts', 'little', 'help', 'Woody', 'character.As', 'comedy', 'movie', 'lot', 'easier', 'take', 'like', 'dramatic', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'more', 'challanging', 'comedies', 'easy', 'gimmicks', 'Not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Manhattan', 'well', 'viewing']",N/A

I ignored the bad reviews on here, thinking ""it can't be THAT bad with actors like Christina Ricci, Jason Biggs, and Danny DeVito"".  I was wrong.  It truly IS that bad; perhaps worse.The good:  Christina Ricci playing an extremely sexy, yet immature and grating character; Jason Biggs doing an exceptional job with a poorly-written script; Danny DeVito doing an amazing job with a small role; a couple of other attractive women in small parts; and a couple points where you actually laugh.The bad:  Woody Allen's (not intentionally) annoying character; a pretty pathetic plot; and a poorly-written, unfunny script.The ugly:  Woody Allen's constant mention of Jews and his perceived hatred of them.Christina Ricci really does shine in this movie.  While her character is intentionally annoying, she makes you care about her (not the least of which because she's gorgeous).  Similarly, Jason Biggs does a very good job and makes you care about his character.  Likewise, Danny DeVito makes you care about his character, though his role is unfortunately small.  This is a testament to the ability of these actors, and a lesser degree to the director.The problem is that it's really not a very good plot, and the script is pure tripe.  I've never seen Woody Allen in anything before, and my initial reaction is that he likes to hear himself talk.  There's just no other excuse for his character.  The character is neither funny nor witty.  If he was meant to be a sort of mentor to Jason Biggs' character (as it appears he was), his lines should have been rewritten and the role should have been given to a better actor.  To me, his performance was flat.  He didn't make me care about his character at all.At many times throughout the movie, I almost turned it off.  The only reason I didn't is because I kept thinking ""It HAS to get better"", and it did get a little bit better at the end.  But does 20 minutes or so at the end justify sitting through 89 minutes of pain?The bottom line is this:  If you're the type of person who must see everything that one of these actors does, then you're going to watch this no matter what any reviewer says.  If you're just a casual fan, or are just looking for something to entertain yourself, skip this one.

620557,A16F2K8VG7GDS9,B00005JMON,"Daniel Friedman ""dfja17""","[2, 2]","Let's be honest and upfront about this.  I love Woody Allen movies and always have, right up through his last truly great film, Bullets Over Broadway.  Since then, it's been scattershot.  Mighty Aphrodite and Everyone Says I Love You were okay.  Hollywood Ending wasn't that bad.  Deconstructing Harry was an interesting change of pace.  Other than that, I can't say that I've enjoyed any of his more recent films.  Celebrity, Small Time Crooks, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion - nearly unwatchable.  It almost seems like he's phoning it in.So turning to Anything Else, it appears that he might have learned some lessons from his previous efforts by removing himself as the romantic lead.  Thankfully - who wants to see Woody wooing Christina Ricci?  And also thankfully, he gave himself a part that is actually the best one in the film.  His wisecracking Dobel generates most of the genuine laugh moments in the plot alongside an under-used Danny DeVito.  Unfortunately, since Woody is not playing the main &quot;Woody&quot; character, it's left to Jason Biggs to more or less assume the persona which gave me some qualms, especially remembering Kenneth Branagh's Woody impersonation in Celebrity.  Surprisingly, Biggs pulls it off without lapsing into caricature but it's hard to digest that a twenty-something man would just happen to possess all of the neuroses and cultural tastes of Woody Allen as we have come to know him.The same goes for Christina Ricci.  She doesn't do anything horrible in the film but her character becomes very tiresome very quickly and while it enhances the comedy elements surrounding Biggs's character, it's probably not the best idea for a romantic comedy to make one half of the loving pair so annoying.Stockard Channing is also a wonderful actress with an interesting character who doesn't get enough screen time.  I know that a lot of actors make sacrifices just for the sake of being in a Woody Allen movie, but some deserve more when they achieve something.  I mentioned Danny DeVito earlier - his scene in the restaurant and Stockard Channing's when she plays the piano are gems.Fortunately for the film, Jason Biggs can do subtle comedy and his character generates a lot of empathy.

Yes there are some slow spots that kind of drag.  Yes Jason Biggs is not quite 100% believable as a younger Woody Allen alter ego, try as hard as he does to deliver the same lines and mannerisms and body language (he's just way too good-looking, heh).The key to fully appreciating this movie is to see that Dobel, the mentor-character to Biggs which Allen plays in his true to life 60 year old incarnation, is really meant to be a guide, a muse, and a spiritual teacher of sorts.  Rough hewn, very imperfect, often quite absurd/bizarre/deranged, but all the same he does manage to push Biggs out of his prolonged good-Jewish-boy-hood (guilt-ridden, co-dependent, acquiescent), to liberate him into risk-taking and freedom-seizing true adulthood especially befitting an aspiring writer.  On his way to the airport to fly to LA and make a clean break from his stagnant life in NYC, Biggs by sheer chance (or is it?) happens to see his now-former girlfriend (convincingly played by Christina Ricci) walking rapturously hand in hand with a doctor who examined her during one of her psychosomatic attacks.  Kaboom!  Rome crumbles, and the Romans heave a sigh of relief.So over the course of the film, Biggs is freed from his attachments and delusions---or the really big encumbering ones at least.  This is actually a far more optimistic film than ""Annie Hall,"" which implied at the end that we are fated to repeat those delusions and attachments because we NEED them.It is also very sharply written, in fact it often feels more like a theatrical production than a film even compared to Allen's usual dialogue-dominant work.  There are a lot of insights though, not just droll wit like most of his work.Highly recommended, esp. for repeated viewings.

This movie has a good number of funny moments as well as clever philosophical musings, but the formula seems a bit worn.  The characters don't seem realistic, but more like warped caricatures of previous Woody Allen film roles.  In the film, the Jerry character seems to become increasingly mature while all the other characters become increasingly pathological in their behavior.

I highly recommend it.  Also, this movie has the ""distinction"" of having one of my two favorite scenes from movies in it.  One of them is when Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm in ""When Harry Met Sally.""  The other comes about 10 minutes before the end of this flick and is Woody Allen's response to the two bullys.  I won't give it away, you'll recognize it.  I thought this was a good movie, not just a good Woody Allen movie.  This is the 2nd time I've seen it, and I found it a million times funnier this time than I did the 1st.  I don't know why.

Christina Ricci play's Woody's love-interest.  Woody stars as an older, more impulsive, less cautious, ""wiser"" but crazy version of Woody, whose role is to give young Young Woody ""wise"" advice.

620574,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMON,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 7]","In recent years Woody Allen has given the Woody Allen roles in his films to younger actors than himself, and ""Anything Else"" follows suit by putting Jason Biggs in the lead as Jerry Falk, a struggling comedy writer.  The primary focus is on his relationship with Amanda (Christina Ricci), his neurotic girlfriend, who wants to live with him but not sleep with him, which is something that bothers him a lot more than it bothers her.  Jerry is not only having second thoughts about his relationship with Amanda, but also his business arrangement with his manager, Harvey (Danny DeVito), who seems to be getting most of the money for doing little of the work.  Jerry is in analysis, but his psychiatrist (William Hill) does not believe in offering opinions, just asking questions.  That leaves it to Allen's character, schoolteacher and comedy writer wannabe David Dobel, to urge Jerry to question pretty much everything in his life.The title is a punch line to whatever observation about life you might want to make.  Whatever life is, it is just like anything else.  When it comes to Woody Allen films there is a sense that ""Anything Else"" is a lot like some of Allen's other films as well.  The most obvious line of thought is to think of it as a twenty-something version of ""Annie Hall,"" although neither as funny nor as insightful.  Whether that is because Marshall Brickman is not part of the equation or because Allen is simply decades older and running out of new ideas and insights is open to debate.  There is nothing wrong with the performances.  Biggs does a nice job in the Woody Allen role, without resorting to outright imitation like Kenneth Branagh did in ""Celebrity,"" and Ricci manages to keep Amanda interesting enough to understand why Jerry does not simply run fleeing from her.  What I liked was how every time she deals Jerry a body blow bends but does not break or even crack.  Even Allen is more polished than usual, without the onslaught of vocal qualifiers that made reading a transcript of ""Annie Hall"" a tad frustrating.There are some good jokes here and I think I probably laughed more out loud at this one than I have at any other recent Woody Allen film (should I just say more than any other Woody Allen film this century?).  But if those constitute steps forwards having scenes that remind you of earlier Allen films, such as the cocaine scene here and the (better) one in ""Annie Hall,"" are steps backwards, especially since nothing here is better the second time around.  There are also some pacing problems and parts of this one drag.  ""Anything Else"" is one of the longer Woody Allen films at 108 minutes (I used to be able to show most Woody Allen movies in a 90-minute Interpersonal Communication class), and I end up rounding down because it feels that long as well.  Of course, the audience for Woody Allen films are a lot older than the characters played by Biggs and Ricci, and the best thing about this film is that it might persuade younger viewers to try out his more classic films, such as ""Manhattan,"" ""Hannah and Her Sisters,"" ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" and that one that won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1978.",3,"Some good zingers but this twenty-something version of ""Annie Hall"" drags a bit too much",1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,3159,"['recent', 'years', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'given', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'roles', 'films', 'younger', 'actors', 'Anything', 'Else', 'suit', 'putting', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'lead', 'Jerry', 'Falk', 'struggling', 'comedy', 'writer', 'primary', 'focus', 'relationship', 'Amanda', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'neurotic', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'live', 'not', 'sleep', 'something', 'lot', 'more', 'Jerry', 'not', 'only', 'having', 'second', 'thoughts', 'relationship', 'Amanda', 'also', 'business', 'arrangement', 'manager', 'Harvey', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'who', 'be', 'getting', 'most', 'money', 'doing', 'little', 'work', 'Jerry', 'analysis', 'psychiatrist', 'William', 'Hill', 'not', 'believe', 'offering', 'opinions', 'just', 'asking', 'questions', 'Allen', 'character', 'schoolteacher', 'comedy', 'writer', 'wannabe', 'David', 'Dobel', 'urge', 'Jerry', 'question', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'life.The', 'title', 'punch', 'line', 'whatever', 'observation', 'life', 'might', 'want', 'make', 'Whatever', 'life', 'just', 'anything', 'else', 'When', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'sense', 'Anything', 'Else', 'lot', 'Allen', 'other', 'films', 'well', 'most', 'obvious', 'line', 'thought', 'think', 'twenty-something', 'version', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'funny', 'insightful', 'Marshall', 'Brickman', 'not', 'part', 'equation', 'Allen', 'simply', 'decades', 'older', 'running', 'out', 'new', 'ideas', 'insights', 'open', 'debate', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'performances', 'Biggs', 'nice', 'job', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'role', 'resorting', 'outright', 'imitation', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'did', 'Celebrity', 'Ricci', 'keep', 'Amanda', 'interesting', 'enough', 'understand', 'why', 'Jerry', 'not', 'simply', 'run', 'fleeing', 'What', 'liked', 'was', 'how', 'time', 'Jerry', 'body', 'blow', 'bends', 'not', 'break', 'even', 'crack', 'Even', 'Allen', 'more', 'polished', 'usual', 'onslaught', 'vocal', 'qualifiers', 'made', 'reading', 'transcript', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'tad', 'are', 'good', 'jokes', 'here', 'think', 'probably', 'laughed', 'more', 'loud', 'one', 'have', 'other', 'recent', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'should', 'just', 'say', 'more', 'other', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'century', 'constitute', 'steps', 'forwards', 'having', 'scenes', 'remind', 'earlier', 'Allen', 'films', 'such', 'cocaine', 'scene', 'here', 'better', 'one', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'are', 'steps', 'backwards', 'especially', 'nothing', 'here', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'also', 'pacing', 'problems', 'parts', 'one', 'drag', 'Anything', 'Else', 'one', 'longer', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', '108', 'minutes', 'used', 'be', 'able', 'show', 'most', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', '90-minute', 'Interpersonal', 'Communication', 'class', 'end', 'up', 'rounding', 'down', 'that', 'long', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'audience', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'are', 'lot', 'older', 'characters', 'played', 'Biggs', 'Ricci', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'might', 'persuade', 'younger', 'viewers', 'try', 'out', 'more', 'classic', 'films', 'such', 'Manhattan', 'Hannah', 'Her', 'Sisters', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'one', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', '1978']",N/A

As the lights dim, the audience is ushered into the latest Allen production by the sound of retro music. Also typical of the writer and director's films, the movie is set in Manhattan.Much of the film is comprised of Allen staples. In fact, the only two things that seem to be out of place are the main characters, Biggs as Falk and Christina Ricci as Amanda. It is as if the casting agent blindly picked out two of the most popular teenybopper actors of today and threw them into the movie without regard for subject matter, dialogue or context.Amanda and Jerry live in the latter's apartment, which is inexplicably inhabited by old furnishings, better suited for a lower middle class grandmother. The audience is never told why the young couple's abode is decorated in such a manner, nor does it add anything to the script. Ikea, many a poor, post-graduate's favorite interior designer, would have provided a more believable and far less distracting setting, if the target audience is the latest crop of boy band chasers.This kind of uneasy dichotomy seems to run through the whole movie. The young stars seem to have been picked to draw in a younger audience. Yet, everything else is old. Allen is old, the furniture is old, and the music is old. Even Amanda and Falk's tastes are old by today's Gen-Y standards. In a scene set in the Village Vanguard, the couple discuss Humphrey Bogart, Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra. As Diana Krall ends a song, Amanda remarks that, &quot;She is so moving.&quot; Later, Jerry tries to woo Amanda in a music store by offering to purchase her a vinyl album of Cole Porter music.Allen's script is wholly mismatched for Biggs and Ricci. The work is better suited for more mature actors and audiences. It's what one would expect of an Allen love-child with the producers of &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; except there aren't any compelling and contrived dramas.The film plods along with several different plotlines running and never quite meeting or making a solid point. It's almost like watching a disjointed reality television show about a random guy's life without having all the boring parts edited out. Even the normally seductive and conniving Ricci is reduced to being a neurotic and body obsessed female with a gratingly whiny voice.To Allen's credit, he does provide a few laughs with his writing. True to form, much of the movie is comprised of quick banter between the characters. Lines like &quot;There was something compelling about your apathy,&quot; and &quot;Don't be so middle class,&quot; are gems only Allen himself could dream up.However, these highlights may not compel audiences to choose this film. If you overhear someone saying that he wants to see &quot;anything else,&quot; don't be surprised if he actually means he want to see anything --other than the movie of the same name.",2,Gen-Y pair can't fit in Allen film,1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,2988,"['quot', 'Anything', 'Else', 'quot', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'David', 'Dobel', 'much', 'older', 'mentor', 'young', 'impressionable', 'Jerry', 'Falk', 'played', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'lights', 'dim', 'audience', 'ushered', 'latest', 'Allen', 'production', 'sound', 'retro', 'music', 'Also', 'typical', 'writer', 'director', 'films', 'movie', 'set', 'Manhattan.Much', 'film', 'comprised', 'Allen', 'staples', 'fact', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'place', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'Biggs', 'Falk', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Amanda', 'casting', 'agent', 'blindly', 'picked', 'out', 'two', 'most', 'popular', 'teenybopper', 'actors', 'today', 'threw', 'movie', 'regard', 'subject', 'matter', 'dialogue', 'context.Amanda', 'Jerry', 'live', 'latter', 'apartment', 'inexplicably', 'inhabited', 'old', 'furnishings', 'better', 'suited', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'grandmother', 'audience', 'never', 'told', 'why', 'young', 'couple', 'abode', 'decorated', 'such', 'manner', 'add', 'anything', 'script', 'Ikea', 'many', 'poor', 'post-graduate', 'favorite', 'interior', 'designer', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'more', 'believable', 'far', 'less', 'distracting', 'setting', 'target', 'audience', 'latest', 'crop', 'boy', 'band', 'chasers.This', 'kind', 'uneasy', 'dichotomy', 'run', 'whole', 'movie', 'young', 'stars', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'picked', 'draw', 'younger', 'audience', 'everything', 'else', 'old', 'Allen', 'old', 'furniture', 'old', 'music', 'old', 'Even', 'Amanda', 'Falk', 'tastes', 'are', 'old', 'today', 'Gen-Y', 'standards', 'scene', 'set', 'Village', 'Vanguard', 'couple', 'discuss', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Diana', 'Krall', 'song', 'Amanda', 'remarks', 'quot', 'so', 'moving.', 'quot', 'Later', 'Jerry', 'woo', 'Amanda', 'music', 'store', 'offering', 'purchase', 'vinyl', 'album', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'music.Allen', 'script', 'wholly', 'mismatched', 'Biggs', 'Ricci', 'work', 'better', 'suited', 'more', 'mature', 'actors', 'audiences', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Allen', 'love-child', 'producers', 'quot', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'quot', 'are', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'contrived', 'dramas.The', 'film', 'plods', 'several', 'different', 'plotlines', 'running', 'never', 'quite', 'meeting', 'making', 'solid', 'point', 'almost', 'watching', 'disjointed', 'reality', 'television', 'show', 'random', 'guy', 'life', 'having', 'boring', 'parts', 'edited', 'out', 'Even', 'normally', 'seductive', 'conniving', 'Ricci', 'reduced', 'being', 'neurotic', 'body', 'obsessed', 'female', 'gratingly', 'whiny', 'voice.To', 'Allen', 'credit', 'provide', 'few', 'laughs', 'writing', 'True', 'form', 'much', 'movie', 'comprised', 'quick', 'banter', 'characters', 'Lines', 'quot', 'was', 'something', 'compelling', 'apathy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'middle', 'class', 'quot', 'are', 'only', 'Allen', 'could', 'dream', 'up.However', 'highlights', 'may', 'not', 'compel', 'audiences', 'choose', 'film', 'overhear', 'someone', 'saying', 'see', 'quot', 'anything', 'else', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'actually', 'want', 'see', 'anything', 'other', 'movie', 'same', 'name']",N/A

It differs most notably to prior Allen romantic comedies in that he has put another, younger star in the spotlight. Jason Biggs plays Gerry, a young comedian who is having problems in both his career and love life. He lives with a woman named Amanda (Christina Ricci) who is, at best, ambivalent towards him. He confides in an older man, a schoolteacher named Dobel (Woody Allen). The conversations between Gerry and Dobel seem mainly like excuses for Allen to get in his familiar one-liners. Dobel is a frustrated comedian with decidedly paranoid tendencies; at one point he buys Gerry an assault rifle, a periscope and other survival gear for protection. Neither Gerry nor Amanda are especially memorable characters. Biggs seems more like a generic, if insecure, twenty-something than the kind of neurotic urban intellectual usually prominent in Allen films. Ricci's character Amanda seems to exist mainly to frustrate and confuse Gerry and it's not apparent why he bothers with her. As in most Allen films, there are some nice, albeit insulated scenes of New York City (there are never any crowds or traffic).  This review may make the film sound worse than it is. I actually found it quite entertaining. Many of these criticisms are based on having seen so many of Allen's great films, compared to which this seems like a watered-down rehashing.

Ricci survives slightly more, but still has trouble delivering that Woody Allen female lead brashness that is so vital in most of his films. Even the story is hackneyed and there are very few surprises.

This is an entertaining film for the true fan.  The only real problem with the film is Allen's casting of Jason Biggs in the lead role.  He is a terrible actor and a poor youthful substitute to fill Allen's shoes.  The saving grace of this film is Christina Ricci.  She plays a thoroughly unlikeable character but she plays it with style and range.  She also comes off the most attractive I have ever seen her in a film.  Danny De Vito does a great job as well.  Allen's scenes toward the end are particularly strong.  The ending is one of Allen's best.  Genuinely touching.

Allen plays a colorful, albeit supporting, part as Biggs' lunatic mentor who has a hilarious ""dark side"".There are plenty of classic Woody Allen-style laughs in this neurotic comedy about a young, insecure comedy writer and his free-spirited, impossible to please girl friend.  The cast, which includes Stockard Channing (as Ricci's unstable mother), Danny DeVito (as Biggs' manager) and Jimmy Fallon (as Christina's former boy friend), is certainly talented.The problem is that Woody Allen is the kind of writer whose dialogue has a certain unique rhythm.  [David Mamet is another.]  If the actors don't pick up that rhythm, the scene, no matter how well written, doesn't work.  And, unfortunately, in the case of ANYTHING ELSE, the performers have not always captured the Allen rhythm.  Several scenes that should have been funny, thus come off as an annoying whine.This film may not be anywhere near Woody's best work, but it certainly has enough engaging moments in it to make it worth a look.

First, Jason Biggs is simply a youthful body used to personify Woody Allen. If Allen had been young enough to play this part, I think he would have, and it shows. Biggs fails to make the character his own and so he falls flat, saying phrases like ""make love"" and talking about diaphragms in a way that only Allen could believably. Second, his love for Amanda, a parody of every quirky woman who ever lived rolled into one persona, doesn't make any sense, which is unfortunate because their relationship is the driving force of this movie. Third, the therapy sequences serve no purpose other than to show how pointless therapy is, which could have been done more succinctly. Last, I found it hard to believe that Jerry, a struggling writer, could afford to live in New York with his failed actress girlfriend in the manner they were living. Where is the money coming from?I usually find a bright spot in every one of Allen's movies, even if I don't really like the film much, and this one was no exception. Not surprisingly, the bright spot was Allen himself as Jerry's odd friend Dobel.

620585,A1F1IYH05Q028D,B00005JMON,SamSpade,"[3, 4]","Thought I'd write a positive review for a change. Unfortunately a lot of negative reviews have brought this film's ratings down. That shouldn't come as a surprise considering the apparent lack of aesthetic, taste and judgment of people. What did come as a surprise is that all these negative reviews get a collective rating from users that is close to 20/500. That's an aside to this review but amazon had better find a way to incorporate how people rate reviews to their overall product score. You cant get say two one star reviews with 0/10 ratings each, i.e. no one considers them helpful or accurate, and still get the product rated as one star.The only sore thumb of this movie is Jason Biggs, the guy can't act. Woody wanted an actor appealing to the younger audiences and Biggs was suggested to him. Allen hadn't even watched american pie before casting him. Biggs ends up mirroring Woody in terms of acting, which is not a big thing, since even established actors tend to that when casted in his films (Ken Branagh amongst a lot of others), but his mimicking of Woody is so cut and dry, and with absolutely no flair at all. Thankfully his wooden performance doesn't detract this much from what is an absolute joy of a film to watch. I don't think I can find enough to say about Christinna Ricci, she's so wonderfully talented, and even in her lesser parts or in her lesser performances she always brings something to the role she's playing. And in this one she's got a very good script in her hands playing the self absorbed, shallow and a little psychotic but nevertheless adorable kitten girlfriend. She delivers such a nuanced performance, it's impossible to think anyone in Hollywood could have done a better job. Everything from her body movements, to her grimaces, to the slight tonal changes in her voice is pitch perfect. Danny DeVito an Stockhard Channing bring a lot to their roles too, elevating the script even more. And there's of course Woody, who's in top form here, with his neurosis and his one liners.This for me was the real return to form for Woody, to comedic form that is, because nothing here is akin to his social-relationship commentary in the eighties and nineties, after a few decent but forgettable films. In here you can find and find a very heart warming and serious plot underneath the comedy, a lot of great scenes, very funny ones, and Woody never goes overboard with the jokes or his personal monologues. Of course it didn't do well with the under 25 in the U.S. due to their mental and cultural impairment but that was to be expected, despite dreamwork's huge marketing backing that went behind it, surpassing by far any of Allen's films before or since. I won't go into any more detail as a lot of people have commented before and I stand almost 100% by what these 5 star reviewers have said, so there's no need to get superfluous. This is a wonderful, sensitive and funny film by one of the master actors/writers/directors who's still gracing us with his work. Enjoy.",5,Excellent.

620587,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMON,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 8]","`Anything Else' reminds me of Woody Allen's earlier masterpiece `Annie Hall' in more than one way - a love romance in New York City, an aspiring comic writer, funny one-liners, jazz songs, and most of all, the choice of the hero/heroine who might or might not leave the city. The difference is that `Anything Else' doesn't achieve the level of humor and pathos of `Annie Hall.' Perhaps the film's soulless touch might reflect Allen's own feelings about the city and filmmaking itself these days, and also explain this strangely weariness of the film that is very disappointing.Jason Biggs plays Allen's alter ego, young comedy writer Jerry who really wants to write a serious novel. He struggles to make his dream come true for all this incompetent agent Harvey (Danny DeVito) and his frigid girlfriend Amanda (Christina Ricci) who refuses to sleep with him (for six months). Perhaps some viewers would find these characters unlikely or worse, unlikable - and Jerry and Amanda are all living in a nice, clean room together in New York City, and afford to hear Diane Krall singing and stay in a hotel (single room, $200) - well while we are watching these annoying and implausible characters, another irritating person arrives. It is Amanda's mom Paula (Stockard Channing), who 'tries' something new (here white powder) ... like in 'Annie Hall.'This formula of vintage Woody Allen comedy with eccentric characters might have worked in the 70s and 80s. Actually, there are some funny jokes from Allen himself, playing Jerry's mentor David Dobel, but the film itself, especially the first part, is slow and boring. Fast and snappy dialogues are not to be found, and the character of Ricci, who fails to show the charm of a real coquette, is only irritating.Actually, the casting itself is the real problem. Jason Biggs is not convincing as struggling Jewish writer, and neither is Ricci as whimsical heroine. I know it is too much to expect from them the chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton, and what is more embarrassing is that Ricci is seen prowling in her underwear, as if compensate the lack of that credibility of romance.`Anything Else' is definitely not meant for those who are going to watch Woody Allen films for the first time - in that case, he or she would never come back again -- nor for his devoted fans, who prefer his films with romance, humor, wit, and insightful observation about life.

For those with the ability to get past the central casting (some just can't buy Ricci and Biggs talking about Billie Holiday), this variation on Allen's neurotics-in-love presents the familiar material from a truly  fresh perspective for the first time since the 1977 classic:  Its almost a goodbye to the neurotic New York milieu, a refutation of the themes of seasonal rebirth and human foibles that Allen has been working over and over (often to fine effect) since ""Annie Hall.""  If fact, ""Anything Else"" could almost be the anti-""Annie Hall"":  Thirty years on, the neurotic girlfriend no longer seems as sweet as Diane Keaton, but rather as barbed and dangerous as the big-eyed Ricci.  Even Danny DeVito's sweet loser of an agent (which Allen played himself in ""Broadway Danny Rose"")gets mercilessly rebuked.
