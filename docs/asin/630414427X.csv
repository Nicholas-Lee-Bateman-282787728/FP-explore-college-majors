Those expecting a standard biography of the renowned Italian painter need to look elsewhere for this is anything but a standard biography. Those familiar with Derek Jarman's other movies will not be surprised by what they find here but others certainly will (as various reviews attest). The painter Caravaggio becomes a metamphor for artists in general and what they have to deal with in order to produce their art. It specifically references the London art scene of the 1980s which Jarman was actively involved with. The deliberate anachronisms of cigarettes, calculators, and typewriters are there to reinforce this.The main reason the film works for me is Jarman's use of light, shadow, and color along with the recreation of the stagings of the subjects of Caravaggio's paintings (He began his career as a painter before becoming a set designer -Ken Russell's THE DEVILS- and film director). The remarkable visuals, the quality performances of Nigel Terry, Sean Bean, Tilda Swinton (in her film debut) and the intruiging screenplay by the director kept me continually engrossed in the proceedings. I highly recommend that you run the film with subtitles so that you don't miss a word of Nigel Terry / Carvaggio's voiceovers. They enrich and help you to understand the nature of the subject and of the film itself.In addition to the reasons listed above, I applaud CARAVAGGIO for its strong supporting cast (Michael Gough, Robbie Coltrane, Nigel Davenport), fluid camerawork, and creative use of a limited budget (the film was financed mostly by Britain's Channel Four) which works to Jarman's advantage as it gives him tighter creative control over what he wants to show and how he can show it. This is closer to a filmed play (that borrows heavily from Bertolt Brecht) than an actual movie although it is very cinematic. Jarman's use of homoerotic imagery is less pronounced here than in many of his other works but that will still bother some people. Fortunately a lot less than it did 25 years ago.For me CARAVAGGIO was not a complete success but I still rate it 5 stars for accomplishing everything it did on such limited resources. Because it deliberately refuses to be your average film biography, it has managed to stay with me a lot longer than many more accomplished films of that nature. Whether I completely like it or don't like it should have nothing to do with its overall rating. In my opinion it's what you do with what you've got that counts for everything and Derek Jarman's films in general and CARAVAGGIO in particular have managed to achieve quite a lot.",5,This Is Not Your Father's Caravaggio...,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,2662,"['anyone', 'else', 'Derek', 'Jarman', 'CARAVAGGIO', 'therein', 'tale', 'expecting', 'standard', 'biography', 'renowned', 'Italian', 'painter', 'need', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'anything', 'standard', 'biography', 'familiar', 'Derek', 'Jarman', 'other', 'movies', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'what', 'find', 'here', 'others', 'certainly', 'will', 'various', 'reviews', 'attest', 'painter', 'Caravaggio', 'metamphor', 'artists', 'general', 'what', 'have', 'deal', 'order', 'produce', 'art', 'specifically', 'London', 'art', 'scene', '1980s', 'Jarman', 'was', 'actively', 'involved', 'deliberate', 'anachronisms', 'cigarettes', 'calculators', 'typewriters', 'are', 'there', 'reinforce', 'this.The', 'main', 'reason', 'film', 'Jarman', 'use', 'light', 'shadow', 'color', 'recreation', 'stagings', 'subjects', 'Caravaggio', 'paintings', 'began', 'career', 'painter', 'becoming', 'set', 'designer', '-Ken', 'Russell', 'THE', 'DEVILS-', 'film', 'director', 'remarkable', 'visuals', 'quality', 'performances', 'Nigel', 'Terry', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'film', 'debut', 'intruiging', 'screenplay', 'director', 'kept', 'continually', 'engrossed', 'proceedings', 'highly', 'recommend', 'run', 'film', 'subtitles', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'word', 'Nigel', 'Terry', '/', 'Carvaggio', 'voiceovers', 'enrich', 'help', 'understand', 'nature', 'subject', 'film', 'itself.In', 'addition', 'reasons', 'listed', 'applaud', 'CARAVAGGIO', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Gough', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'Nigel', 'Davenport', 'fluid', 'camerawork', 'creative', 'use', 'limited', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'financed', 'mostly', 'Britain', 'Channel', 'Four', 'Jarman', 'advantage', 'tighter', 'creative', 'control', 'what', 'show', 'how', 'can', 'show', 'closer', 'filmed', 'play', 'heavily', 'Bertolt', 'Brecht', 'actual', 'movie', 'very', 'cinematic', 'Jarman', 'use', 'homoerotic', 'imagery', 'less', 'pronounced', 'here', 'many', 'other', 'works', 'will', 'still', 'bother', 'people', 'Fortunately', 'lot', 'less', 'did', '25', 'years', 'CARAVAGGIO', 'was', 'not', 'complete', 'success', 'still', 'rate', '5', 'stars', 'accomplishing', 'everything', 'did', 'such', 'limited', 'resources', 'deliberately', 'be', 'average', 'film', 'biography', 'managed', 'stay', 'lot', 'longer', 'many', 'more', 'accomplished', 'films', 'nature', 'completely', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'should', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'overall', 'rating', 'opinion', 'what', 'do', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'everything', 'Derek', 'Jarman', 'films', 'general', 'CARAVAGGIO', 'particular', 'have', 'managed', 'achieve', 'quite', 'lot']",Caravaggio VHS

404015,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,630414427X,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","This film deals with a painter of great fame from the end of the Renaissance. It is the story of a man of course but also of his assistant. He literally bought a mute boy out of his misery when he was a small child and took him to his studio to work for him, to grind his colors and prepare his paints. He will of course use the child as a model for some exuberant bacchic scenes overloaded with fruits of all sorts. The mute boy becomes the friend of the painter and little by little this friendship must have become love, real love, the mental and sentimental passion.On the other hand the artist is attracted by male bodies mostly but in the strength they demonstrate when they are fighting. So he is looking for violence, muscular tension, aggressiveness in males, one body against another, and some compositions of several men demonstrating their power in some scenes implying violence and cruelty. This search for violent brutality excludes love. It is pure desire and one of these men will have a tragic ending because he understood this desire required him to love the artist back and thus to do what he thought the artist wanted him to do. His mistake, especially since it was killing a pregnant woman.The only one who has the right (the artists granted him that right), the duty (the artists expected him to do what's concerned here), the obligation even to love him back, is the young assistant because that assistant was bought and is the artist's possession, the only person the artist has the duty and the obligation to take care of as if he were his own child. And in this case it is real love from the artist to the assistant and from the assistant to the artist, to and fro and back all the time. This assistant will bring the artist to his own death on his own death bed and he will be the only one able to bring him to death in peace, to grant him death in a way, though it will be for the assistant a tragedy, a drama with a phenomenal solitude afterwards, though this is not explored in the film.All other men the artists selects on their own strength are supposed to accept his love but definitely not love him back. They do not have that right because the artist only satisfies his own desire but never ever anything that has any real sentimental or mental dimension. He uses these men as satisfying actors in his sexual desire just the same way as he uses them as props in his studio to compose a scene that he can then paint on the canvass.Living and working close to the Pope, Caravaggio is classified a sodomite but tolerated because of his art, because of the marvelous paintings he can produce. But in this extremely sectarian and fundamentalistic society he is living in he is obliged to mind every step of his and pay for his privilege a very high artistic price. The result is that he is locked up in his sodomite closet and he has no way to get out of it. So his love is nothing but a perversion and he cannot expect from anyone to love him since it would be a perversion too. Then his love is reduced to a gross physical and violent impulse and he takes what he needs to satisfy this impulse, he pays for it since it is nothing but a forbidden fruit that has a very high price, and it is finished. Full stop. Period.And that is the moment when you start wondering about his assistant. Man cannot live without any love. If any love between two men is impossible as a permanent and stable relation, you have to disguise this relation in a way or another. The mute assistant is perfect since Caravaggio got him when he was six or seven and he has a very clear function and position to satisfy. The relation is seen by most people more like the relation between a father and a son and the possible sexual dimension of it might very well never have been consumed. Art least this part was not important. What was important was the tears shed by the assistant when his master died, when he brought him to death.I would easily say that any man longs for such a relation that is not and cannot be carnal. Men finds that in younger people who are their sons or close male relatives, at times younger men who need some mentor or leader or advisor. It is love but draped in some age or cultural dependency that makes it acceptable. Such a relation will never be sexual because it would be antagonistic with what the passion it contains means.And that distance in time between Caravaggio and us is clearly identified in the film with all kinds of anachronistic sounds or objects: electricity at the end of the 15th century, motorbikes, cars, trains, helicopters, cigarettes, etc. Has the world improved or is it still the same? I would say that in 1886 it probably looked pretty the same as around 1600. But it may also mean that luckily progress will bring some new ay of looking at life and love.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,"Love only existed with, for and from the mute assistant",1404259200,"07 2, 2014",2014,4840,"['film', 'painter', 'great', 'fame', 'end', 'Renaissance', 'story', 'man', 'course', 'also', 'assistant', 'literally', 'bought', 'mute', 'boy', 'misery', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'child', 'took', 'studio', 'work', 'grind', 'colors', 'prepare', 'paints', 'will', 'course', 'use', 'child', 'model', 'exuberant', 'bacchic', 'scenes', 'overloaded', 'fruits', 'sorts', 'mute', 'boy', 'friend', 'painter', 'little', 'little', 'friendship', 'must', 'have', 'become', 'love', 'real', 'love', 'mental', 'sentimental', 'passion.On', 'other', 'hand', 'artist', 'attracted', 'male', 'bodies', 'mostly', 'strength', 'demonstrate', 'when', 'are', 'fighting', 'looking', 'violence', 'muscular', 'tension', 'aggressiveness', 'males', 'one', 'body', 'compositions', 'several', 'men', 'demonstrating', 'power', 'scenes', 'implying', 'violence', 'cruelty', 'search', 'violent', 'brutality', 'excludes', 'love', 'pure', 'desire', 'one', 'men', 'will', 'have', 'tragic', 'ending', 'understood', 'desire', 'required', 'love', 'artist', 'back', 'thus', 'do', 'what', 'thought', 'artist', 'wanted', 'do', 'mistake', 'especially', 'was', 'killing', 'pregnant', 'woman.The', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'right', 'artists', 'granted', 'right', 'duty', 'artists', 'expected', 'do', 'what', 'concerned', 'here', 'obligation', 'even', 'love', 'back', 'young', 'assistant', 'assistant', 'was', 'bought', 'artist', 'possession', 'only', 'person', 'artist', 'duty', 'obligation', 'take', 'care', 'as', 'were', 'own', 'child', 'case', 'real', 'love', 'artist', 'assistant', 'assistant', 'artist', 'fro', 'back', 'time', 'assistant', 'will', 'bring', 'artist', 'own', 'death', 'own', 'death', 'bed', 'will', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'able', 'bring', 'death', 'peace', 'grant', 'death', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'assistant', 'tragedy', 'drama', 'phenomenal', 'solitude', 'afterwards', 'not', 'explored', 'film.All', 'other', 'men', 'artists', 'selects', 'own', 'strength', 'are', 'supposed', 'accept', 'love', 'definitely', 'not', 'love', 'back', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'right', 'artist', 'only', 'own', 'desire', 'never', 'ever', 'anything', 'real', 'sentimental', 'mental', 'dimension', 'men', 'satisfying', 'actors', 'sexual', 'desire', 'just', 'same', 'way', 'props', 'studio', 'compose', 'scene', 'can', 'then', 'paint', 'canvass.Living', 'working', 'close', 'Pope', 'Caravaggio', 'classified', 'sodomite', 'tolerated', 'art', 'marvelous', 'paintings', 'can', 'produce', 'extremely', 'sectarian', 'fundamentalistic', 'society', 'living', 'obliged', 'mind', 'step', 'pay', 'privilege', 'very', 'high', 'artistic', 'price', 'result', 'locked', 'up', 'sodomite', 'closet', 'way', 'get', 'love', 'nothing', 'perversion', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'anyone', 'love', 'would', 'be', 'perversion', 'too', 'Then', 'love', 'reduced', 'gross', 'physical', 'violent', 'impulse', 'what', 'satisfy', 'impulse', 'nothing', 'forbidden', 'fruit', 'very', 'high', 'price', 'finished', 'Full', 'stop', 'Period.And', 'moment', 'when', 'start', 'wondering', 'assistant', 'Man', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'love', 'love', 'two', 'men', 'impossible', 'permanent', 'stable', 'relation', 'have', 'disguise', 'relation', 'way', 'mute', 'assistant', 'perfect', 'Caravaggio', 'got', 'when', 'was', 'six', 'seven', 'very', 'clear', 'function', 'position', 'satisfy', 'relation', 'seen', 'most', 'people', 'more', 'relation', 'father', 'son', 'possible', 'sexual', 'dimension', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'consumed', 'Art', 'least', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'important', 'What', 'was', 'important', 'was', 'tears', 'shed', 'assistant', 'when', 'master', 'died', 'when', 'brought', 'death.I', 'would', 'easily', 'say', 'man', 'longs', 'such', 'relation', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'carnal', 'Men', 'younger', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'sons', 'close', 'male', 'relatives', 'times', 'younger', 'men', 'who', 'need', 'mentor', 'leader', 'advisor', 'love', 'draped', 'age', 'cultural', 'dependency', 'acceptable', 'relation', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'sexual', 'would', 'be', 'antagonistic', 'what', 'passion', 'distance', 'time', 'Caravaggio', 'clearly', 'identified', 'film', 'kinds', 'anachronistic', 'sounds', 'objects', 'electricity', 'end', '15th', 'century', 'motorbikes', 'cars', 'trains', 'helicopters', 'cigarettes', 'etc', 'world', 'improved', 'still', 'same', 'would', 'say', '1886', 'probably', 'looked', 'pretty', 'same', '1600', 'may', 'also', 'mean', 'luckily', 'progress', 'will', 'bring', 'new', 'ay', 'looking', 'life', 'love.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Caravaggio VHS
404016,A2H4AWIOK1REMX,630414427X,"J. C Clark ""eanna""","[3, 8]","I guess the deliberately jarring and anachronistic visuals were there to demonstrate that Caravaggio was of no era but an artist for all time. No argument from me; the John the Baptist painting featured strongly is located here in KC, and is one of the jewels of our collection. An astounding and amazing painting, it just destroys everything else in the room. It is a work of stupendous genius and power.Unfortunately, the version of it visible in the studio in this film is a tame and shallow copy. Just like the film, it is trying to be something it is not. The endless silly images undercut the seriousness of the story. At one point, as Tilda Swinton opens a large rectangular package. I said to my wife, ""Maybe it's a computer.""When I read things like ""a meditation on sex, art, power....blahblah"" I know I'm in for it. I know that a ""meditation"" in film never says anything, it just tosses images around as if showing people lusting and misbehaving tells us something. But this film tells us nothing. Caravaggio was a jerk, who mistreated those who cared for him and chased those who didn't. The people around him were users and cheats and liars and deceivers. OK, yeah, well, that's not actually news. Nor is it interesting.So, while there is lots of beauty, with languid and lush images filling the screen, this was one dull and irritating film.

The film's director and the film's subject is beest summed up in Caravaggio's quote while painting; ""All art is against lived expression.  How can you compare flesh and blood against pigment?!!....I have trapped pure spirit in matter!""  This was the creed and the mission, almost Holy Grail of Caravaggio, as well as the late Jarman; to take life and mimic art, and to make art mimic life!Writer/director Derek Jarman and Italian masterpiece artist Michaelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571-1610) cannot and will not be separated in this film.  The director and the artist are soulmates in life and art, 400 years apart in time, but indelibly linked in common purpose in life and purpose.  Jarman, always the provacateur in film sees Caravaggio the same as himself; struggling against all convention, religion, and social norm to capture the human spirit on canvas and on film.  Jarman honours Caravaggio's famous figures that illuminate out of the blackened background of the canvas rendering all of the film's scenes in that same spirit. Actors Nigel Terry, as Caravaggio; Tilda Swinton as Lena the prostitute; Sean Bean as the street trade object of desire Ranuccio Tomassoni; Michael Gough as the pederast Cardinal Del Monte; and Spencer Leigh as the deaf mute who is Caravaggio's lifelong apprentice Jerusalameare all realistically portrayed as the true humans they were in forming Caravaggio's stable of models, friends, rivals, tutors, admirers and jealous lovers, all of which were the real life people who were the John the Baptists, Baachus' and Virgin Mary's of his 50 great masterpieces.  Jarman frames each scene as Caravaggio would have seen it; he shows us how the artist saw the human life as it was and painted it into The Divine.  This, of course, was a prevailing criticism of the time placed upon Caravaggio's work; he used live models, not pictures, to portray what he was to put to canvas.  This upset many other artisrs, and infuriated the Church, though secretly Cardinals and Popes commissioned his work as ""intimate chamber pieces known for their homoerotic ambience."" (Interestingly, the religious commissioned these paintings, but hid them behind curtains in the Salon!)Derek Jarman makes no apology for his open homosexuality, as Caravaggio made no apology for his work and fascination with the male form.  Therefore, this film has a strong emotional connection between the filmmaker and the painter; the two understand one another deeply and Nigel Terry, as Caravaggio, is overwhelmingly the artist on screen. The subject of pederasty, older male taking under wing the younger male (which was quite common in the day- not just simply apprenticeship) is openly examined in CARAVAGGIO; Was the relationship strictly tutorial in the mind, but was it also educational of the body, also?I have watched this film several times over before deciding to review it.  There is just simply so many levels on which this film can be viewed.  Jarman, undoubtedly intends it to be that way; CARAVAGGIO is about art and the artist, but it is also about human desire, passion in life, and passion in Art.  One viewing of a Jarman film is NEVER sufficient. To see it as pornography (as some are wont to do) does no credit to the filmmaker or the 17th -century genius who gave us paintings such as ""Death of the Virgin"", ""The Incredulity of Thomas"", ""The Cardsharps"",""The Calling of St. Matthew"", ""Amor Vincit Omnia"",""Boy With a Basket of Fruit"", ""Young Sick Baachus"" as well as ""The Entombment of Christ.""  Jarman cleverly and with awe and reverence ""stages"" all of these paintings  with great precision within his film. Even the famous ""The Calling of St. Matthew"" is hilariously framed as a sniping news critic types his critique of Caravaggio in a bathtub with the famous ""ray of light"", that is in the painting,streaming through a window upon the man!  Such is the imaginative Jarman, who never shies away from shocking images that to some seem senseless.I admit, this film so intrigued me, upon my first viewing, that it cause me to do a more exhaustive search on Caravaggio.  What that search yielded made me gain a far deeper appreciation for the artist, himself, who was sexually open with both men and women, who was put into exile, who needed a papal pardon, who painted life as he saw it, who was constantly arrested for brawling and who died under mysterious and controversial circumstances and whose life has been biographied countless times by ""experts"" who vehemently disagree about him!!!  This makes Jarman's film all the more provoctive.  Nothing that I see in this film contradicts anything that I have found in my discoveries.  But Jarman is not just wanting us to see Caravaggio as an historical figure, as many movies tend to do; but is rather interested in painting, as it were, a canvas of the celebration and hardships of humanity on film.In conclusion, Derek Jarman, I consider to be a genius filmmaker, but his films are quite unique and controversial.  His filmsEdward IIandCaravaggio [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Italy] I have found to be more accessible than some of his more ""experimental"" films, such asThe Last of Englandand  ""Blue"",

He surrounded himself with earthy street people who became the models for his paintings.If you're looking for a biopic about the life of Caravaggio, look elsewhere.  This chaotic and bizarre interpretation of his life by avant-garde director Derek Jarman is like seeing art history on a bad acid trip.  The story opens well enough around the year 1600, but I thought I was seeing things when I saw a man in a tuxedo.  I scratched my head at the calculator, but the motorbike and truck were too much.  The use of anachronistic images and odd sound effects (trains, crashing ocean waves) was too jarring and distracting for me.  There was little dialogue, the range of accents included cockney and Irish, and the narration made no sense.As a fan of Caravaggio's work, I did enjoy the scenes that showed models posing for his famous paintings, but the rest - a montage of unrelated scenes showing his depraved lifestyle - was just distasteful and speculative. Tilda Swinton made an impressive screen debut in the puzzling role of a street woman and a very young Sean Bean is interesting as her companion, but Nigel Terry was an off-putting Caravaggio.

I was so struck by the shadowy drama and sparkling wit of the imagery that I dragged EVERYONE I KNEW to see it.  They still have my fingermarks on their arms.Jarman's film is not a biography in the strict sense.  Rather, he uses Caravaggio's paintings and a loose chronology of events as a point of departure to present his own musings on art, love, sexuality and its politics.  The photography is painterly in the best sense of the word and evokes the period acutely.  The cast, a director's dream by any standard, is splendid. Tilda Swindon absolutely glows on screen, Sean Bean is as feral as a tomcat, and Nigel Terry is believably world-weary and laconic, a prisoner of his vision, his debauchery, and the unfolding destiny the intersection of the two character traits dictates.Jarman makes excellent use of anachronistic elements in the film to point out the relevance of those issues to the present day.  My favorite scene shows a Vatican functionary, wearing nothing but his nightcap, sitting in a porcelain bathtub and typing on a manual typerwriter...in the 15th century!  The witticisms are unmistakeable and very ably presented.  Ironically, they make the whole film seem even more convincingly Baroque.Video was the last time this film was available, and I'm very glad that someone had the nerve to reissue it on DVD.

I made it past halfway and gave up.I can stand the anachronisms like cigarettes, un-period costumes, a typewriter, etc.  What I couldn't handle was the glacial pace, the vacuousness of Jarman's conceit.  Nothing in the film illuminates the work, and that's sad. He never takes us into the mind or life of the artist (and the over-ripe voice over is a dud), but focuses relentlessly on surfaces.  Some are lovely, some scenes are worth watching, for a moment or two, but then they drag on and on, like the girl/guy swirling a scarf in front of a painting at a party so long you want to slap her or him.

404022,A8IHLMGDIOK8L,630414427X,Pekinman,"[1, 1]","Derek Jarman was a great film maker, up to a point.  His aggressive penchant for anachronism sometimes comes off a little heavy-handedly but there is usually a fair amount of humor inherent with those moments.  Time and place mean little to him and somehow it doesn't matter.  I am not familiar with Jarman's 'philosophy' of film making or anything like that, not being a cinema scholar, but I can only suppose from viewing his work that he is more interested in a mythical approach to his subjects.  His interest in historical subjects like St Sebastian, Edward II and Caravaggio and the like, leads me to think he had a very deep searching mind that responded to the universal humanity in those people that can be found today in people of our own time.  He was a classicist pouring new wine in to old bottles.There isn't much of a story in Caravaggio beyond the day-to-day activities of a sensuous, intelligent and genius of a painter.  The motto on Caravaggio's stiletto says Nec Spe Nec Metu (no hope no fear).  A rather wise and clear-eyed philosophy of life.  This film is rather wise and clear-eyed as well despite the lack of riveting narrative and dramatic impetus.The cast is superb.  Nigel Terry is wonderful as Caravaggio, his low-key style of acting fitting in well with this enigmatic and world-weary character.  Sean Bean is beautiful and fascinating as Ranuccio, Caravaggio's purported lover.  I say purported because, unlike many of Jarman's films, there are no obvious scenes of sex or nudity.  Much is suggested but not blatantly depicted.The supporting cast is outstanding, especially Tilda Swinton in her first screen role.The greatest reason to see this film is the cinematography which is like a Caravaggio painting come to life.  The colors are magnificent, and you can almost smell the oil paints and linseed and straw on the ground, not to mention their filthy feet!The way to watch this film is to go in to a mild trance and let the visuals wash over you.  Don't look for Sean Bean's naked body either, there is no nudity at all, at least in the version I watched, which was not the special edition or the director's cut.  Perhaps, if a director's cut exists, there is more to see in the flesh department.A fine, thought-provoking film for a rainy Sunday afternoon.",4,Stunning visuals.

While it was immediately pretty evident that Jarman was attempting to bring modern 'relevance and/or identification' factors to this art history piece (an admirable concept) - I found the overall end result to be somewhat lacking.  The film has a decidedly 'staged' quality with many of the sets really looking like 'sets' which detracted from the 'authenticity' of the production.  There was also a lot of time devoted to the rather speculative homoerotic elements between Caravaggio & one of his male models, and the model's wife as the plot line skipped around to certain 'high-lights' of the artist's life.  I found it somewhat annoying too that the director chose to picture 'in process' sequences of Caravaggio working on his paintings with some low quality replications of his work that bore little resemblence to the actual techniquess that an artist in Caravaggio's day would have employed. While credit may be given for an inventive attempt to make Caravaggio 'come alive' for a modern audience, in essence the whole exercise came off a bit like a cartoon overview of a remarkanle man's life, and I feel somethng was lost in the translation.  Fortunately, I also purchased an alternative Italian TV mini-series version (also titled 'Caravaggio') that proved to be much more authentic in its' recounting of the artist's life history and works.

404028,A2OKXMWMMAB400,630414427X,the Baroness Bruce-Campbell deVermandois,"[3, 4]","Being a professional artist, when I saw this title I was excited; it's always ( well,almost always) informative,intriguing to see a Great Master's life story told on celluloid.I am troubled by the effusive, sycophantish raves I see as reviews here. What Jarman has done with Caravaggio's tumultuous life is self-serving, proselytizing, diminishing, obscene, marginalizing & deeply offensive. This was about Jarman attempting to depict some misbegotten, self-aggrandizing pseudo-relationship to a Master, NOT about the true life the beleagured artist lived.All the anachronistic nonsense (train sounds, typewriter,cigarettes, automobile) is distracting and lifts the viewer out of the film; it isn't artsy or clever, just awkwardly foolish ,cumbersome and self-defeating. Whatever Jarman was smoking when he came up with this treatment is surely illegal. Using actors whose accents were clearly Irish, British and even cockney was very silly, also a distraction.This film puts me in mind of something an hormonal high school senior might conceive in an elective film-arts class. While there are a couple of moments where the sets-costumes do vaguely resemble a composed painting, they're not Caravaggio's palette and certainly not authentic to his work. Other posters have commented on the quality of the reproductions used in the film. Both Jarman and the arrogant hack who painted them ought to be horse-whipped for profaning the sublime canvases Caravaggio achieved at such great cost in his life.There were so many directions Jarman could've gone in to tell this extraordinary story. That he chose such a vulgar framework reflects badly on him, suggest motives best left in the dark corners of Jarman's fetid imagination. I love Fellini, Kubrick and other ground-breaking avant garde filmmakers, so don't accuse me of hating. Substandard work is substandard no matter how avant garde the filmaker or director tries to play it off as being. It's one of those ""if you don't get it you're a stick-in-the-mud dummy""  kind of attitudes Jarman is holding over the viewer's head like a carrot.How much more relevant & intriguing this movie would've been had Jarman been more of a student and less of a sensationalist.  He could've expositioned Caravaggio's twisted relationship with the Catholic Church;he could've explored the conflict Caravaggio encountered in literally copying Titian; he could've illustrated how Caravaggio championed & refined chiaroscuro and won a solid, glowing place in Art History, something I doubt the artist could ever have guessed would happen.Instead we were beaten over the head with the artist's sexuality. Actually,make that bludgeoned. By the way, in 1500's/early 1600's Rome, there were no fixed sexuality standards as there are today. Jarman is way out in left field in leaning so heavily on homosexuality.As an aside, I was personally offended by the scene of the nude artist practically mauling the dead body of the prostitute he had painted. Now THAT was ugly.It is my sincere hope my review disssuades you from watching this tripe; if people stop watching it, egomaniac filmakers will have to stop making it.",2,Down and Out in Porto Ercole,1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,3145,"['Being', 'professional', 'artist', 'when', 'saw', 'title', 'was', 'excited', 'always', 'well', 'almost', 'always', 'informative', 'intriguing', 'see', 'Great', 'Master', 'life', 'story', 'told', 'celluloid.I', 'am', 'troubled', 'effusive', 'sycophantish', 'raves', 'see', 'reviews', 'here', 'What', 'Jarman', 'done', 'Caravaggio', 'tumultuous', 'life', 'self-serving', 'proselytizing', 'diminishing', 'obscene', 'marginalizing', 'deeply', 'offensive', 'was', 'Jarman', 'attempting', 'depict', 'misbegotten', 'self-aggrandizing', 'pseudo-relationship', 'Master', 'NOT', 'true', 'life', 'beleagured', 'artist', 'lived.All', 'anachronistic', 'nonsense', 'train', 'sounds', 'typewriter', 'cigarettes', 'automobile', 'distracting', 'viewer', 'film', ""n't"", 'artsy', 'clever', 'just', 'awkwardly', 'foolish', 'cumbersome', 'self-defeating', 'Jarman', 'was', 'smoking', 'when', 'came', 'up', 'treatment', 'surely', 'illegal', 'Using', 'actors', 'accents', 'were', 'clearly', 'Irish', 'British', 'even', 'cockney', 'was', 'very', 'silly', 'also', 'distraction.This', 'film', 'mind', 'something', 'hormonal', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'might', 'conceive', 'elective', 'film-arts', 'class', 'are', 'couple', 'moments', 'where', 'sets-costumes', 'do', 'vaguely', 'resemble', 'composed', 'painting', ""'re"", 'not', 'Caravaggio', 'palette', 'certainly', 'not', 'authentic', 'work', 'Other', 'posters', 'have', 'commented', 'quality', 'reproductions', 'used', 'film', 'Jarman', 'arrogant', 'hack', 'who', 'painted', 'ought', 'be', 'horse-whipped', 'profaning', 'sublime', 'canvases', 'Caravaggio', 'achieved', 'such', 'great', 'cost', 'life.There', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'directions', 'Jarman', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'tell', 'extraordinary', 'story', 'chose', 'vulgar', 'framework', 'badly', 'suggest', 'motives', 'best', 'left', 'dark', 'corners', 'Jarman', 'fetid', 'imagination', 'love', 'Fellini', 'Kubrick', 'other', 'ground-breaking', 'avant', 'garde', 'filmmakers', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'accuse', 'hating', 'Substandard', 'work', 'substandard', 'matter', 'how', 'avant', 'garde', 'filmaker', 'director', 'tries', 'play', 'off', 'being', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', ""'re"", 'stick-in-the-mud', 'dummy', 'kind', 'attitudes', 'Jarman', 'holding', 'viewer', 'head', 'carrot.How', 'much', 'more', 'relevant', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'Jarman', 'been', 'more', 'student', 'less', 'sensationalist', 'could', ""'ve"", 'expositioned', 'Caravaggio', 'twisted', 'relationship', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'could', ""'ve"", 'explored', 'conflict', 'Caravaggio', 'encountered', 'literally', 'copying', 'Titian', 'could', ""'ve"", 'illustrated', 'how', 'Caravaggio', 'championed', 'refined', 'chiaroscuro', 'won', 'solid', 'glowing', 'place', 'Art', 'History', 'something', 'doubt', 'artist', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'guessed', 'would', 'happen.Instead', 'were', 'beaten', 'head', 'artist', 'sexuality', 'Actually', 'make', 'bludgeoned', 'way', ""1500's/early"", '1600', 'Rome', 'were', 'fixed', 'sexuality', 'standards', 'are', 'today', 'Jarman', 'way', 'left', 'field', 'leaning', 'so', 'heavily', 'homosexuality.As', 'aside', 'was', 'personally', 'offended', 'scene', 'nude', 'artist', 'practically', 'mauling', 'dead', 'body', 'prostitute', 'had', 'painted', 'Now', 'was', 'ugly.It', 'sincere', 'hope', 'review', 'disssuades', 'watching', 'tripe', 'people', 'stop', 'watching', 'egomaniac', 'filmakers', 'will', 'have', 'stop', 'making']",Caravaggio VHS

The film's stark contrasts of light and dark echo Caravaggio's own innovation in chiaroscuro. Numerous anachronisms appear as well, including cars, calculators, and modern clothing. Like the film's contrasts, these reiterate the anachronisms tha Caravaggio put into his paintings. Although jarring at first, these blends of era add to the movie's quirky charm.Male homosexuality appears repeatedly in Jarman's career, so it's no surprise that Jarman makes the most of the allegations about Caravaggio's orientation. In fact, that offers a major motivation for some of the most dramatic events near the end of this movie - events that form around Tilda Swinton in her first movie role. This brings me to something I found odd in this movie (I mean odd even by this movie's standards): Nigel Terry plays his Caravaggio with an understatement that doesn't always match the magnitude of the events around him. Perhaps a poker face would have suited the dangerous circles in which Caravaggio travelled; perhaps Caravaggio was meant to express himself through his art.The result shouldn't be taken as genuine history.
