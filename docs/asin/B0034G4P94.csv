I passed it by again and again thinking ""I've seen this movie a million times."" I thought it would be a rip-off of The Fighter. I thought it would be terrible and low-budget.  How wrong I was . . . I only watched this movie after reading a quick blurb in Entertainment Weekly where the author opined this movie should get a best picture nomination.  He was dead-on.  This movie was what The Fighter should have been.  It has a few weaknesses (a bit predictable in places, some amazing coincidences) but in the end it just doesn't matter because this movie does what few others do anymore: it tells a great story that really stays with you.  I am sick of movies where all the money is spent on special effects and the script gets whatever is leftover.  This movie is about two brothers torn apart by their dysfunctional family when they are young.  Sound bleak?  It really isn't because overall this is a movie about the human spirit. The story is told against the backdrop of MMA fighting, but the story is the real draw, the MMA is just the vehicle for it.Mark my words: Tom Hardy will become the greatest actor of his generation.  (a secret - he already is).  He is the next big bad in the upcoming Batman movie.  Check him out in a little British mini-series called ""The Take.""  The man is a true chameleon if there ever was one. Nick Nolte also delivers a performance unmatched in his career.

1325315,A281FXS7SA4TB,B0034G4P94,Alaric,"[3, 30]","ALL the elements for a great tragedy are present in Warrior: fratricide, credit/bank peonage (i.e. bailout), abandonment of the brothers by choice and through illness as children, PTSD, veterans and their widows left to dry by their government&society; ectcetera . . . the litany of plot elements that were nailed-true combined with the performances of the principle actors makes the moral failure of this movie that much more devastating and incomprehensible.That said, there doesn't ever need to be another MMA movie, the acting was so strong in this one; I wanted to love it, but it was sabotaged in various places and became a Stallone-ish meatheaded, moralistic travesty with a unbelievably reactionary conclusion.(spoilers follow) Plot typology of principle charactersThe unknown quantity (Tom Hardy) turns out to be a war hero, whose medal of honor feat of physicality becomes a viral video, leading to the realization that he was in the process of going AWOL after a friendly fire bombing run blew away his entire unit, him being the sole exception. He will be taken into custody after the conclusion of the tournament and court marshaled.Universal nice guy (Joel Edgerton) has refinanced his mortgage twice (daughter's heart condition) and is facing bankruptcy or foreclosure. In his youth, rather than move with his kid brother and ailing mother and assume a George Baily man of the house role (It's a Wonderful Life), he remains in-town to: 1.) get training from his father denied to him when Hardy's character was around 2.) marry his high school sweetheart. Turning the corner at 30, the has-been all around failure returns to MMA to make ends meet, subsequently losing his position as a highschool physics teacher; he is a New England Walter White of Breaking Bad minus 15 years, in his own way.Deadbeat absentee alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) has cleaned up with AA and finds younger son on his porch. His overtures at reconciliation vacillate between hopelessly self-pitying and pathetic, and vicious ambition.-- -- --Review and Analysis by principle charactersHardy's darkness, the war, is completely glossed over. From his first take down of Mad Dog Grimes in the gym sparring match onwards, it had to be clear that he does not care if he kills his opponents in the ring and that that is perhaps what he aims for. Hardy represents the socioeconomic/moral blowback of the other two's actions as well as those of society (the war, the banking shenanigans). The film ends with a fraternal reconciliation offered as a memory hole cover for predatory housing loans, bailouts, war, desertion charges and personal betrayal.The financial compulsion/desperation of Edgerton is not felt acutely enough; the foolish vanity of not declaring bankrupcy is not utilized/explored nor the strain on the marriage made manifest by it. His idolization by his students also marks him for an Icarus-fall with them as witnesses. Edgerton's character is not a credible master tactician cum Rocky, who overcomes his physical disadvantages by biding his time. The triumph of Edgerton's huberis is the principle dramatic and moral failure of the film.Nolte's character has the least flawed writing and the only fully developed character in the film. The Nolte-Hardy dialectic is masterful and correctly done (he HAS to relapse, and does Hardy holds the mirror up to him), but the Nolte-Edgerton relationship was not maintained by his resentment against his father for not being the favorite son as much as was required; ""I've forgiven you Dad, -but I don't trust you."" As Hardy notes on the beach of the Sparta event, ""You're full of s*** man, I feel sorry for you."" Edgerton -the sensitive reflective guy- has the biggest chip on his shoulder of the three with the most to prove and never realizes it.The gains of having Edgerton's character come out on top (the son most like his mother gives the alcoholic father's favorite son a beat down and the father as well by proxy) are so grossly outweighed by other plot dimensions/possibilities that their merits are not worthy of enumeration here. Edgerton represents the American Dream as is currently understood today. His victory in the film serves the maintenance of this set of lies: Warrior is a propaganda film.""I didn't even get to say goodbye to her, my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me."" -Actually, Conan O'brien look-alike, you surrendered that right in order to chase after you Dad's approval and to become a teenage dad which put you in the economic hole you're in now; you chose your father over your dying mother and kid brother.""My brother was in the Core.""Amen.",1,Reverse Alchemy: Tragedy to Farce,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,4632,"['elements', 'great', 'tragedy', 'are', 'present', 'Warrior', 'fratricide', 'credit/bank', 'peonage', 'i.e', 'bailout', 'abandonment', 'brothers', 'choice', 'through', 'illness', 'children', 'PTSD', 'veterans', 'widows', 'left', 'dry', 'government', 'society', 'ectcetera', 'litany', 'plot', 'elements', 'were', 'nailed-true', 'combined', 'performances', 'principle', 'actors', 'moral', 'failure', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'devastating', 'said', ""n't"", 'ever', 'need', 'be', 'MMA', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'one', 'wanted', 'love', 'was', 'sabotaged', 'various', 'places', 'became', 'Stallone-ish', 'meatheaded', 'moralistic', 'travesty', 'unbelievably', 'reactionary', 'conclusion', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'Plot', 'typology', 'principle', 'charactersThe', 'unknown', 'quantity', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'out', 'be', 'war', 'hero', 'medal', 'honor', 'feat', 'physicality', 'viral', 'video', 'leading', 'realization', 'was', 'process', 'going', 'AWOL', 'friendly', 'fire', 'bombing', 'run', 'blew', 'away', 'entire', 'unit', 'being', 'sole', 'exception', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'custody', 'conclusion', 'tournament', 'court', 'marshaled.Universal', 'nice', 'guy', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'refinanced', 'mortgage', 'twice', 'daughter', 'heart', 'condition', 'facing', 'bankruptcy', 'foreclosure', 'youth', 'rather', 'move', 'kid', 'brother', 'ailing', 'mother', 'assume', 'George', 'Baily', 'man', 'house', 'role', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'in-town', '1', 'get', 'training', 'father', 'denied', 'when', 'Hardy', 'character', 'was', 'around', '2', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Turning', 'corner', '30', 'has-been', 'failure', 'returns', 'MMA', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'subsequently', 'losing', 'position', 'highschool', 'physics', 'teacher', 'New', 'England', 'Walter', 'White', 'Breaking', 'Bad', '15', 'years', 'own', 'way.Deadbeat', 'absentee', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'cleaned', 'up', 'AA', 'younger', 'son', 'porch', 'overtures', 'reconciliation', 'vacillate', 'hopelessly', 'self-pitying', 'pathetic', 'vicious', 'ambition.', 'Review', 'Analysis', 'principle', 'charactersHardy', 'darkness', 'war', 'completely', 'glossed', 'over', 'first', 'take', 'down', 'Mad', 'Dog', 'Grimes', 'gym', 'sparring', 'match', 'onwards', 'had', 'be', 'clear', 'not', 'care', 'opponents', 'ring', 'perhaps', 'what', 'Hardy', 'socioeconomic/moral', 'blowback', 'other', 'two', 'actions', 'as', 'well', 'society', 'war', 'banking', 'shenanigans', 'film', 'fraternal', 'reconciliation', 'offered', 'memory', 'hole', 'cover', 'predatory', 'housing', 'loans', 'bailouts', 'war', 'desertion', 'charges', 'personal', 'betrayal.The', 'financial', 'compulsion/desperation', 'Edgerton', 'not', 'felt', 'acutely', 'enough', 'foolish', 'vanity', 'not', 'declaring', 'bankrupcy', 'not', 'utilized/explored', 'strain', 'marriage', 'made', 'manifest', 'idolization', 'students', 'also', 'Icarus-fall', 'witnesses', 'Edgerton', 'character', 'not', 'credible', 'master', 'tactician', 'cum', 'Rocky', 'who', 'physical', 'disadvantages', 'biding', 'time', 'triumph', 'Edgerton', 'huberis', 'principle', 'dramatic', 'moral', 'failure', 'film.Nolte', 'character', 'least', 'flawed', 'writing', 'only', 'fully', 'developed', 'character', 'film', 'Nolte-Hardy', 'dialectic', 'masterful', 'correctly', 'done', 'relapse', 'Hardy', 'mirror', 'up', 'Nolte-Edgerton', 'relationship', 'was', 'not', 'maintained', 'resentment', 'father', 'not', 'being', 'favorite', 'son', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'required', ""'ve"", 'forgiven', 'Dad', '-but', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Hardy', 'notes', 'beach', 'Sparta', 'event', ""'re"", 'full', 's***', 'man', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Edgerton', '-the', 'sensitive', 'reflective', 'guy-', 'biggest', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'three', 'most', 'prove', 'never', 'it.The', 'gains', 'having', 'Edgerton', 'character', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'son', 'most', 'mother', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'favorite', 'son', 'beat', 'down', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'proxy', 'are', 'so', 'grossly', 'outweighed', 'other', 'plot', 'dimensions/possibilities', 'merits', 'are', 'not', 'worthy', 'enumeration', 'here', 'Edgerton', 'American', 'Dream', 'currently', 'understood', 'today', 'victory', 'film', 'maintenance', 'set', 'lies', 'Warrior', 'propaganda', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'say', 'goodbye', 'own', 'mother', 'had', 'right', 'keep', '-Actually', 'Conan', ""O'brien"", 'look-alike', 'surrendered', 'right', 'order', 'chase', 'Dad', 'approval', 'become', 'teenage', 'dad', 'put', 'economic', 'hole', ""'re"", 'now', 'chose', 'father', 'dying', 'mother', 'kid', 'brother', 'brother', 'was', 'Core', 'Amen']",N/A

1325324,A9CHQYIX61N1T,B0034G4P94,Amazon Customer,"[0, 1]","Acclaimed director Gavin O'Connor (MIRACLE) does the incredible AGAIN. Warrior is about two brothers who enter a mixed martial arts fighting competition, SPARTA, in order to win the world championship prize of $5 Million dollars. The youngest brother, Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy), who went AWOL from the Marines, intends to give the prize money to his deceased military friend's widow and children.  Tommy physically resembles the Incredible Hulk with a monster body and raging anger. The oldest brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton), a high school physics teacher, ex-fighter, and husband/father, needs the money to rescue his family home from foreclosure. Brendan breaks a solemn promise to his wife (Jennifer Morrison) that he would never fight again and this adds marital tensions on top of their financial woes. Brendan is the underdog at SPARTA because he is unknown and has a lightweight athletic build compared to Tommy and other star athletes.Tommy harbors childhood animosity towards Brendan because Brendan left home to runaway with his girlfriend (now wife) at the age of sixteen, leaving Tommy alone as a little scared boy to take care of their dying mother. Brendan was unaware at the time when he jumped the family ship that their mom was sick with cancer. Before the brothers square off in the ring, Brendan asks Tommy to let bygones be bygones.  Brendan even tries to show his wallet-size happy family photos to Tommy but Tommy's bitter response is that he doesn't have a brother. While the emotional fire blazes between the two brothers, their recovering alcoholic father, played by Nick Nolte, pleads with both for forgiveness and a second chance at reestablishing a father-son bond.Warrior exhibits remnants of Rocky by separately showcasing both brothers getting into mental and physical shape. Tommy is trained by their veteran father but defiantly decides the what, when, where, and how of the training. Go figure. Brendan trains humbly in the shadow of eye candy jaw dropping star athletes and they are all being coached by his friend-trainer (Frank Grillo) known for incorporating classical music into training techniques.  Tommy advances up the competition ranks with Mike Tyson-like one-jab knockouts.  Brendan beats his opponents with mind-over-matter endurance after tiring them from several rounds. When Tommy and Brendan finally compete, one side of the arena is filled with Tommy's military colleagues cheering him on, while on the sidelines, the police await to arrest Tommy for military desertion.  As for Brendan, the typical Hollywood scene shows him noticing his wife in the arena crowd giving him the ""I love you, I support you"" smile. Brendan makes one last plea to Tommy to call off the fight but Tommy turns deaf ear.  The audience is left to see who will win as the toughest man on the planet.Warrior is not a typical guy fight flick. This intense action drama sizzles with raw emotion. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton light the screen brightly with superior acting performances. Both draw your sympathy and frustration equally in their respective roles. The pace of the movie was with lightning speed never leaving a lull spot. Let me not forget the resurrection of Nick Nolte.  He too made a promising comeback. Warrior had two drawbacks.  The first drawback is that with every fighter having a pretty baby face, no one was ugly or scarred from the heavy beating from fighting, and this seemed unrealistic. The second drawback is the ending. While it could have been less Hollywood (the two brothers walk out of the fight hugging each other), the ending may have been designed for a Warrior sequel. Due to the violence, it is not a family movie per se, but it is a movie that has several lessons for families to learn from.

Most critics fell in love with Brad Pitt'sMoneyball, but it was this mixed martial artist fighter film about family that I thought shined the most this past year. ""Warrior"" -- as the previous fighting films mentioned before -- is about more than just fighting; it's about two estranged brothers, both of whom have childhoods that they are simply trying to move on from. Big brother Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) has a wife and two daughters that he is trying his hardest to support on his meager high school physics teacher salary while little brother Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is a Marine who has come home to his former alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) in hopes to win prize money for the wife and son of a fallen comrade. The two enter the same tournament where they soon will have to face and fight each other. The film is more than a fight movie; this is a film about confronting one's issues and facing unfinished business.

1325327,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0034G4P94,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","I really hate the name of this movie.  In all honesty, the name `Warrior' denotes a cheapness that really isn't present here.  In fact, outside of some clich&eacute;d plotting (especially in that final showdown) and some unflattering editing decisions (the workout montage was ill conceived, for my personal taste at least), this film is far from cheap.  `Warrior' is actually a very astute look at the war within ourselves to forgive and forget and move on from the roughness that is life.  While one may assume that `Warrior' is yet another attempt to cash in on men inflicting violence on other men for sport, it has far more heart than that.I'd even go as far as to say that `Warrior' is superior to last year's Oscar horse, `The Fighter'; although they are both in the B-Grade level for me (`Warrior' inching more towards a B+).`Warrior' tells the story of three men connected more so by violence than by blood.  Paddy Conlon is a former boxer and a former drunk who inflicted so much physical and emotional damage on his two sons, Brendan and Tommy, that he has absolutely no relationship with them.  Brendan ran off when he was still a young boy with his heavily abused mother and has been missing from Paddy's life for fourteen years.  Brendan stayed around, mostly because he had fallen in love with his High School sweetheart, and lives close by but remains out of touch with his father; sending the occasional picture and receiving the occasional phone call.  Tommy suddenly shows up on his father's doorstep.  He is shrouded with mystery and seems content with keeping his father at an extreme distance.  He is in need of some money and so he decides to train for a Mixed Martial Arts tournament, and he needs his father's help to do so.  Unknowingly, his very own brother Brendan is considering entering the same tournament.  Brendan, a former UFC fighter, is struggling to pay his mortgage and decides to pick up some extra money fighting.Ultimately, we all know who is going to make it to the finals of that tournament.Aside from the obvious predictability of it all (I did, honestly, have NO IDEA who was going to win that fight though), `Warrior' presents a message I wasn't ready to embrace, and yet it was so clear and so honest and so provoking that I can't help but embrace it now.  As the film prods along we get to see these men for the rugged, ravaged, barren souls that they are.  They seem hollow and hopeless and alone and desperate yet apathetic.  They have given up on themselves and all hope of reconnecting.  And then something happens.  Tommy finally abuses his father to a point of no return.  Tommy finally `becomes' the man he hated and then his father, broken to the bone, reverts and falls to pieces and Tommy, previously full of loathing, folds with compassion for the man he grew up fearing.  This same approach is taken at the end of the final fight, where the victorious brother embraces the losing brother with such tenderness.  It's funny, because as I was seeing it I was blown away by how much sense it really made.  In life, we can feel such distain, hatred or even malice towards someone, but when we see them fall apart, especially at our own doing, it rouses in us a love that is often misread as pity but is truly genuine in texture.  I've always said that you cannot hate someone without first loving them, and visa versa.  Those qualities are so specifically interwoven because they are the ying and yang of affections.  You cannot hate someone unless you know them intimately enough to care about who and what they are, and you cannot possibly love someone unless you are know them intimately enough to be moved to hate by their actions.  If you didn't love them then you wouldn't care if they hurt you.  `Warrior' displays that truth beautifully, with subtle notes that make a very big impact.And the acting on all fronts is tremendous.  Many have noted Marlon Brando and his `One the Waterfront' performance when referencing Tom Hardy's performance here.  I wouldn't go that far, but he really evokes a sense of understanding with his rough yet pleading appearance.  For me, Joel Edgarton is the real standout.  He makes Brendan feel so human and relatable.  The way he aches to do right by his family is etched across his face perfectly.  I will say this; I'm surprised that Nick Nolte is not the frontrunner for the Supporting Oscar this year.  Sure, I agree that Christopher Plummer gave the better performance, and so when he wins I'll be ecstatic, but Nolte's performance here is not only great, it is so OSCARY.  I mean, he plays a reformed drunk, he has emotional breakdowns, he is supremely sympathetic despite his obvious monstrous past and he nails his two Oscar moments (the pleading with Brendan and that shocking hotel room scene with Tommy).  If anyone is going to take Plummer's Oscar from him, it'll be Nolte.Either way, a VERY deserving performance is going to win on Oscar night.So, in closing, I was very impressed with `Warrior'.  It's a little too long, it does have that unfortunate montage in the middle that feels dated, unnecessary and cheap, and the way the actual tournament is handled feels rushed in parts and drawn out in others (trying to create tension when we already know who is going to make it to the final two is a little pointless, but thanks for trying I guess), but `Warrior' says a lot more than it's stupid name suggests.`Warrior' has real heart.",4,We always love the ones we hurt...,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,5443,"['really', 'hate', 'name', 'movie', 'honesty', 'name', 'Warrior', 'cheapness',

Then my 17-year old son had to have an operation on his wrist, so he had to take a couple of days to recover.  One of the movies he wanted to see while he was down was this one, and as those of you with HS senior-aged sons may know, it's sometimes tough to get one-on-one time with them.  Anyway, my son, who had seen this movie before, wanted to share it with me, so I plopped myself down and expected your run-of-the-mill fight movie - yawn.  But this movie has a lot more to it than that.This film touches on a wide range of current issues and challenges - the war in Afghanistan, the downturn in the economy, the mortgage crisis, family crises, the impact of social media on our lives, etc.  And this is what makes this film more than a trite ""underdog faces overwhelming opposition"" story line.I won't give away any spoilers, but an aged Nick Nolte plays the role of a reformed alcoholic who missed the chance to have any sort of positive influence on his two sons.  One eventually joins the marines, and the other settles down and works as a HS physics teacher, though they both grew up boxing and then engaging in mixed martial arts, but that was in the past.The kinds of challenges faced by the characters in this film are believable, the story-telling is strong, and the acting is good.All in all, this is a strong movie, though not one you would want to choose for a date night, if you know what I mean.  This is a movie is testosterone-heavy, but still amazingly good.I am debating between 4 and 5 stars because the underdog story line is pretty heavily used, but I would be happy to see it again sometime, because I believe there is more there that I didn't catch the first time through - a hallmark of a good story.P.S.

1325331,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B0034G4P94,Armando N. Roman,"[5, 7]","Warrior is one of the few movies I heard nothing but good things about last year. Most of the people I know with similar tastes to me praised it and put it on their 'best of 2011' lists within the top 10. This surprised me since I'm not used to sports movies getting such great feedback. Sure, I like a lot of sport movies, but I've never seen one that really made me want to go back and watch it again, let alone put it on a top 10, 25, 50 list. I recently gave Warrior a shot once it became available on a certain movie viewing service and, while it held my interest for the most part, it didn't win me over. The movie has some outstanding performances from Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte, and some fairly good fight sequences, but for me there was one big flaw, and that was one of the main characters. Warrior is still definitely worth watching- I don't even like MMA or the UFC and here I am recommending it.We start out with a young man, Tommy Conlon coming back to his hometown and meeting up with his dad, Paddy. This is a huge surprise to Paddy, as he hasn't seen his son in ages. A lot's happened since they last saw each other- Paddy's been sober for almost 1000 days, and now Tommy's looking to start training again. Unfortunately, Tommy lacks the decency to not drink in front of his old man, tempting him with it now and then. Even with this temptation, Paddy takes him in once again. We then meet Brendan, a high school physics teacher who's on the verge of losing his home to the bank. He refuses to file for bankruptcy and resorts to fighting in a strip club parking lot with local guys for a little extra money. Brendan's wife doesn't know about this, as he says he's just working as a bouncer. His luck gets even worse when the school finds out about his fighting, and suspends him without pay for a month. Meanwhile, Tommy becomes an instant internet sensation after a clip of him knocking out a local big shot gets uploaded. With constant training and fights, he's headed for a big event where the grand prize is five million dollars. Brendan, a former UFC competitor, also finds out about the tournament, and we soon learn that he and Tommy are brothers....can you guess where this is going?I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that Warrior wasn't just some dumb fight-fight-fight movie, focusing on dudes getting beat up for 2 hours. The training sequences are well-done, and the beginning fights are over quickly, showing just how fast someone can be taken down, regardless of size or experience. Brendan's past his prime, and the guys he fights aren't exactly on the same page as him, so he's got a ways to go if he's to catch up with Tommy, a former wrestling star and Marine. Of the two characters, I wanted Brendan to win the tournament right from the get-go. He cares about his family having a good home, as well as their financial future. I cared about this character because he's just plain likable. Sure, five million bucks may be a heck of a lot more than he needs for his home situation, but hey, why NOT five million? Tommy on the other hand...well, here's the thing that got me with this movie. I read a lot of comments about both men being underdogs, and viewers not being able to figure out who they wanted to win, because both characters deserved to win. There's no doubting the latter there, but I could not stand Tommy. Arrogant, lacking respect for his father outside of using him as a coach again, not giving Brendan's family a chance when he shows Tommy pictures of his kids, there wasn't anything I liked about him except for one thing. Early on, we find out that he was a military hero, saving a group of his fellow Marines by himself, and also that his best friend was killed. Tommy is now trying to help out his friend's widow and children any way he can, and he wants to win the tournament and give them all of the money. That's a very noble thing to do, and in that sense, I couldn't help but -kind of- want him to win the tournament, but that was only if Brendan didn't come through. The family seems to be doing fine as it is: they're not in some rundown home and struggling for food or anything.Nick Notle does a phenomenal job as their father, never going over the top with his performance. The last thing I saw him in was Peaceful Warrior (how ironic), and I just might like his character here more but in a different way. Whenever alcohol would be near him, I'd keep thinking ""don't do it!"". The guy's come a long way, and had a tough time dealing with things over the years...it'd be a shame for him to throw away all that hard work. Getting chewed out by both of his boys wasn't any easier to see. A conversation between him and Tommy, where Tommy says, ""where were you when it mattered? I needed this guy back when I was a kid. I don't need you now. It's too late now. Everything's already happened"" was especially painful to see and hear, partially because I feel the same way about my dad.Even at the end of this review now, I'm debating on if I should bump the rating up to 4 stars. Warrior moves along quickly and never feels like it's 2 hours and 20 minutes. There aren't any wasted scenes or annoyingly drawn out shots, fights look very realistic, and Joel Edgerton as Brendan won me over. I just wish Tommy were more fleshed out and the plot weren't so predictable. Warrior's a great weekend choice, or just something to watch if you're sick of watching Rocky for the umpteenth time.",3,Rocky for a new generation.,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,5460,"['Warrior',

Tom Hardy looks amazing as a bulked-up MMA fighter.  Nick Nolte looks and performs well as a ""beaten-down in life"" old man.  Joel Edgerton did a great job too.  Story was good, although it feels like it was missing something, but the way this movie was executed was incredible.  Great job on the cinematography. Just one or two scenes where the cameras were a little too shaky when they should've been steady.  The action and the flow of the movie were just right, the fighting was realistic.  There are a few scenes that are grainy, most-likely due to filming in incredibly low-light, but it was probably intended for the gritty feel of certain scenes. This film was entertaining, well-made from a filmmaking perspective, and I think I should have seen it in theaters. Excellent job to the director Gavin O' Connor for making a superb film.As for the supplements, the best are the documentary about how the actors trained to become fighters.  It's about a half hour in length and worth watching. There's also a 20-minute interview with Frank Grillo (trainer for Brendan Conlon in the film) and trainer Greg Jackson that is interesting.  Only a single deleted scene not important to the film. A welcome addition to my Blu-ray collection.

I hate sports films and never heard of this film up until my friend dragged me into it. Two hours later, we were sitting through the credits in utter silence.It has been years since a film has managed to pull tears out of me.And you know what? This isn't some artsy film that touches a few people... everyone else is raving about it. Look at imdb.com top voted films of 2010-2011, Warrior is currently #5 on the list and over at amazon.com it has a full 5 stars.Stats as of 12/26/11:46 reviewers gave it 5 stars3 reviewers gave it 4 stars2 reviewers gave it 3 stars0 reviewers gave it 2 stars1 reviewer gave it 1 star (either a troll or judgmentally impaired)I've never seen these kind of numbers for any film on the site but fully understand why.A few things that make this film work so well is that it transcends the biggest Achilles heel of sports films... predictability.We always know that this person/team will either win or lose.Here we're in love with the two struggling brothers working their way up the MMA food chain so when the numbers thin, our tension skyrockets... who do we root for???There isn't one main character here... this is the story of two brothers and their father. All of them are looking for redemption. Their stories are unfolded an inch at a time, balanced out with superb action that grabs you in a scissor lock and doesn't let go.Tom Hardy was a rising star I've had my eye on ever since Layer Cake but now he has graduated to one of my favorite actors and cannot wait to see him put the cowl on for the Dark Knight Rises. His performance in Warrior is nothing short of perfect.No one really saw this film in its limited release but it's out on all VODs now so go ahead and see why everyone is buzzing about it.Tell your family and friends about this film because it would be a huge injustice to see it not get any Oscar nominations but these days it's more of a political/money game than a quality game.By the way, Tom Hardy's character on this film is the biggest badass of all time.What are you waiting for?

The soldier brother always knocks his opponents out in the first minute of the fight, and the teacher brother is always beat up for the whole fight until pulling off an amazing submission right before the fight ends. I mean, yes this does happen in MMA fights, but it felt pretty contrived in the movie. The action (beyond the believability) was very well done, however it was kind of annoying how often the director liked to cut to people watching the fight, but I understand it's meant to instill emotion into the action.The reason this movie is one of the best sports movies ever made is because of the actors and the script. All of the main characters are incredibly deep, and the emotion in their confrontations go all the way through the screen to your heart.

1325344,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0034G4P94,Brian E. Erland,"[0, 0]","Just wanted to add my own recommendation for the sensational 2011 film 'Warrior'. This one has it all, tremendous action / fighting scenes, high energy and a profoundly poignant drama that will leave the viewer physically and emotionally drained. The production values, story-line and dialogue are top notch and the acting is strong and believable. Nick Nolte as the reformed alcoholic father and Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy as his emotionally tortured sons are unforgettable. In my estimation Nolte performance is worthy of a best supporting oscar nomination but even more amazing is the portrayal delivered by Tom Hardy. It gives me shivers just thinking about it.'Warrior' is a must see, must own film!

There's only one about Wrestling-""The Wrestler"", also good.  Now comes the Mixed Martial Art/UFC-themed ""Warrior"".After 2 hr 20 min rollacoaster ride of Ultimate Melodrama on films in recent years, I have the feeling that this writer/director seems to have cooked up this unbelievably contrived human story first then tag on this MMA/UFC as an afterthought.""Spoiler Alert""2 estranged brothers, both former highschool wrestling champs, 1 a highschool physics teacher facing imminent house foreclosure and 1 an AWOL from Iraq, a substance abuser, who was so devastated as the sole survivor while his close comrade killed by friendly fire.  Both hate their father whom they blamed for their deceased long suffering mother.  Both decided to enter the MMA/UFC fight in Vegas for the $5 million purse with merely a crash course in training.1 asked his old trainer friend and 1 asked his father(a MMA/UFC trainer?) to get them ready and the 2 brothers ended up facing-off in the octagon(the cage).Anyone who has seen UFC fights on TV will know those fighters are a dedicated bunch who live and breath for their moments inthe octagon.  This film's fatal flaw is that there is not a moment that is believable about those 2 brothers ended up as the finalists inthe championship fight.  Why would the highschool teacher risk his life and family entering into this extreme sport instead ofdownsizing his dwelling?  Why would the AWOL brother be not arrested and instead cheered upon by his platoon(where did theycome from?) and wanted to win the $5million to be given to his comrade's widow?  For counter balance, the highschool teacher was cheered upon by his students!  Even the reactions of the highschool teacher's wife was confusing.  First, she wouldn't dare toanswer her phone about the news of her husband's fight.  Next moment, she's at the ring side cheering him on.  The first hour ofthe film, the filmmaker used unnecessary cross editing and multi-screen format to enliven the film tempo.  The gym trainer showedup at the father's doorstep was shown twice for no reason whatsoever.The acting of the 3 leading actors was servicable, considering the script and the direction.  Joel Edgerton gave a more heart-feltperformance.  Again, the much lauded Tom Hardy did not have much to do other than showing his anger and pain.  As for NickNolte who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, he seemed to be under-directed most of the time and looked like he'd downa bottle of scotch in the first secene in the hotel room while in the immediate next shot he seemed to have slept off.Finally for the most important part, the fights, were choreographed and filmed with little excitment.Why would anyone give this film 5 star is beyond me.",2,A Shamelessly Cliche-Ridden Melodrama,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,2845,"['Hollywood', 'made', 'many', 'boxing-themed', 'movies', 'Champ', 'Rocky', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Fighter', 'excellent', 'only', 'one', 'Wrestling-', 'Wrestler', 'also', 'good', 'Now', 'Mixed', 'Martial', 'Art/UFC-themed', 'Warrior', '.After', '2', 'hr', '20', 'min', 'rollacoaster', 'ride', 'Ultimate', 'Melodrama', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'feeling', 'writer/director', 'have', 'cooked', 'up', 'unbelievably', 'contrived', 'human', 'story', 'first', 'then', 'tag', 'MMA/UFC', 'afterthought', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', '2', 'estranged', 'brothers', 'former', 'highschool', 'wrestling', 'champs', '1', 'highschool', 'physics', 'facing', 'imminent', 'house', 'foreclosure', '1', 'AWOL', 'Iraq', 'substance', 'abuser', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'devastated', 'sole', 'survivor', 'close', 'comrade', 'killed', 'friendly', 'fire', 'hate', 'father', 'whom', 'blamed', 'deceased', 'long', 'suffering', 'mother', 'decided', 'enter', 'MMA/UFC', 'fight', 'Vegas', '5', 'million', 'purse', 'merely', 'crash', 'course', 'training.1', 'asked', 'old', 'trainer', 'friend', '1', 'asked', 'father', 'MMA/UFC', 'trainer', 'get', 'ready', '2', 'brothers', 'ended', 'up', 'facing-off', 'octagon', 'cage', '.Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'UFC', 'fights', 'TV', 'will', 'know', 'fighters', 'are', 'dedicated', 'bunch', 'who', 'live', 'breath', 'moments', 'inthe', 'octagon', 'film', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'not', 'moment', 'believable', '2', 'brothers', 'ended', 'up', 'finalists', 'inthe', 'championship', 'fight', 'Why', 'would', 'highschool', 'teacher', 'risk', 'life', 'family', 'entering', 'extreme', 'sport', 'instead', 'ofdownsizing', 'dwelling', 'Why', 'would', 'AWOL', 'brother', 'be', 'not', 'arrested', 'instead', 'cheered', 'upon', 'platoon', 'where', 'did', 'theycome', 'wanted', 'win', '5million', 'be', 'given', 'comrade', 'widow', 'counter', 'balance', 'highschool', 'teacher', 'was', 'cheered', 'students', 'Even', 'reactions', 'highschool', 'teacher', 'wife', 'was', 'confusing', 'First', 'would', ""n't"", 'dare', 'toanswer', 'phone', 'news', 'husband', 'fight', 'Next', 'moment', 'ring', 'side', 'cheering', 'first', 'hour', 'ofthe', 'film', 'filmmaker', 'used', 'unnecessary', 'cross', 'editing', 'multi-screen', 'format', 'enliven', 'film', 'tempo', 'gym', 'trainer', 'showedup', 'father', 'doorstep', 'was', 'shown', 'twice', 'reason', 'whatsoever.The', 'acting', '3', 'leading', 'actors', 'was', 'servicable', 'considering', 'script', 'direction', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'gave', 'more', 'heart-feltperformance', 'Again', 'much', 'lauded', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'other', 'showing', 'anger', 'pain', 'NickNolte', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'seemed', 'be', 'under-directed', 'most', 'time', 'looked', ""'d"", 'downa', 'bottle', 'scotch', 'first', 'secene', 'hotel', 'room', 'immediate', 'next', 'shot', 'seemed', 'have', 'slept', 'off.Finally', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'fights', 'were', 'choreographed', 'filmed', 'little', 'excitment.Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'give', 'film', '5', 'star']",N/A
1325347,A3QG3SC5KFMFL7,B0034G4P94,Captainjep,"[1, 1]","When i first saw this movie i had no intention of buying it. I never heard of it before, and i had seen so many other fighting movies it didn't appeal to me. The only reason i got it at first was because i needed a 4th DVD for blockbuster's 4 for 20$ deal (sometimes if you're lucky its 5 for 20$) So i was desperate to get any DVD to complete the deal and had no idea this movie would turn out to be one of my favorites EVER! That may seem like a big thing to say, but this movie really does have it all. I was completely surprised by how good the story was, how great the acting was, and how i could keep going form start to finish in one sitting. (and its not exactly a short film haha) Heres what you get from this movie:Tom Hardy is now one of my favorite actors, the way he portrays Tommy is full of emotion and dedication to what he wants to do. You end up cheering for him even though he plays a guy with an attitude. Whats great about this film is that you can relate to pretty much ANYONE. For anyone who has had problems with paying for their home bills, Joel Edgerton who play's Tommy's brother in the film does a fantastic job as a father who is desperate to make a life better for his family. You really end up relating to the brothers in their own way.  And when it comes to knowing how to draw your attention in Nick Nolte does an AMAZING job as the father of the two brothers (in my opinion he should have won the Oscar for best supporting Actor but WHATEVER) From there the movie really picks up, showing great shots of city streets as they train for an upcoming martial arts tournament as well as what the MMA media world really looks like with fighters from all over the world coming together. As for the ending i defy you to try and not feel any emotion, but thats all I'm going to say.This movie is worth your money, If you get it for 5 dollars or even 20 at a Best Buy or something. The acting is fantastic, and the characters really actually feel like real people. Thats what movies struggle with to get my attention, i like to actually feel like I'm in the movie, not just staring at a screen for 2+ hours. Rent this movie if you must just to be sure, but you will enjoy it. Fantastic job and i commend everything that went into making this movie.EXTRAS INCLUDE:""Redemption: Bringing Warrior To Life"" Documentary""Philosophy In Combat: Mixed Martial Arts Strategy""Simply Believe: A Tribute to Charles ""Mask"" Lewis, Jr.Cheap Shots: Gag ReelBrother vs. Brother: Anatomy Of The Fightand more!so there you go! hope this helps you make up your mind.

1325349,A1PHUCTJ9X9EHJ,B0034G4P94,Christ's Soldier,"[0, 0]","*SPOILER ALERT*I really l iked this movie and thought it was good. It was interesting. had the physical and emotional aspect of life, along with family ties. Basically what I got was it's about a family who's father was a drunk and abusive. The mom and youngest son tommy left them, and brendan the oldest son stayed behind. The father gets sober a little less than 3 years and tommy comes back from the marines only to say mom died....and then he wants his dad to train him to fight. Both of the sons through the whole movie most obviously hate the dad and have major resentment.So the plot is all about this tournament winner takes all 5 million $. Brendan a physics teacher learns that he is in need of money due to his hosue being in danger of foreclosure, implicitly seen because of shady bank advice. So the retired ufc family man with 2 daughters thrust himself back into the mma world for some quick cash to save his house. meanwhile tommy is training with paddy the dad. I am only explaining all this because the movie built of tommy so much the ending threw me for a major negative loop although i like the ending I am sure it could have went a different route. So tommy always got the attention from paddy, the father, and was #1 state champ in wrestling for high school. A marine who even saved other marines in times of danger, gone awol because couldn't cope with the tragedy is trying to make some bucks so he can help his fallen comrade/ best friends family. So during training he knocks out the current middleweight mma champ tko in a sparring session, which lands him a ticket into spart, the 5 mil tourny. His first round he knocks the guy out with 1 punch. The second round was the mad dog , same guy as in the sparring session, but because mad dog was talking trash, he got knocked out in like 5 seconds with a ground and pound (face smash). That's all I remember up until his final fight with his brother. So the movie built him up as the mega ultimate fighter who defeats all opponents in like 5 seconds. It's known his dad is a war vet and a talented trainer.so tommy's brother brendan is now a physics teacher out the game, out of shape and married with children. Soft as it is. He asks an old friend to train him to make money to safe his house. I think he gets around 5 weeks. During the training he shows major improvement and even bests the the fighter chosen to go to sparta.his old friend, the manager, now replaces the #1 guy due to injury with brendan as a request or all by chance/ luck. So in all brendans matches he is the underdog and gets beat up, smashed, pounded, mashed, thrown around, and pulverized, but he manages in all 3 matches to tap them out. Even the russian undefeated champ. So here's why i wrote all that. The family man who by luck rises to the final round is up agianst his ultimate warrior marine brother. and again no contest but brendan slips a move and dislocates his bro's shoulder and goes on to win. Now I love the ending because he gets to keep his house and will probably help tommy's best friend's family out but come on. This is no david and goliath here. I mean i would have believed it mroe if brendan was a Godly man who won because of the power of God because other than that it seems like luck. The movie built tommy up so much there simply was no room in the script for him to loose and I was disappointed. All this said I am still happy with the movie and the ending and think it's better than the fighter! Not sure if it will ahve a sequel but it was so good it could have one! Merry Christmas! Godbless.

I'm also fairly certain I've never seen a Gavin O'Connor directed film until now. To be honest, the one thing that made me want to see this movie was Tom Hardy getting top billing. Hardy's been around awhile, but most probably didn't give the guy much thought until he started showing up in Christopher Nolan films. Bronson was the movie that made me admire his talent though. Warrior is fairly outstanding in general anyway, but could also give even more weight to Hardy's name.Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) lost everything when he was a drunk. His wife died without him by her bedside and both of his sons cut him off almost completely. His younger son Tommy (Tom Hardy) shows up on his doorstep one day after being in the army wanting nothing more than a coach for the big Spartan MMA tournament coming up. Tommy is withdrawn and doesn't want to share anything about his life and it turns out that there's a reason for that. Meanwhile Paddy's other son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is facing a foreclosure on his house and was suspended from his teaching job after being caught fighting in the parking lot of a strip club. Brendan enters the tournament in hopes of keeping his family afloat while Tommy's purpose has something to do with his army brethren. Warrior is more of a story about the Conlon family struggling to find it within themselves to forgive each other rather than who will win this massive MMA tournament.The cast is really phenomenal in this. Nick Nolte manages to outshine both Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as far as performances go. While Hardy and Edgerton are off beating the crap out of each other in the cage, Nolte portrays some amazing emotion. You can tell he's a broken man trying to get his life back on track and everything seems to be blowing up in his face. Joel Edgerton really plays up the whole underdog thing. A physics teacher in an MMA tournament? He doesn't stand a chance. Edgerton displays emotion as well, but his performance is otherwise forgettable. Tom Hardy plays the typical tough guy. Nothing is going to stand in his way. He'd rather not talk if he can help it, but he's an absolute beast in that cage. While each lead actor in the movie has their own strengths and weaknesses, they have all the bases covered between the three of them to make everything come together.Some of the supporting cast is really interesting. This was an intriguing film to follow up leaving ""House, MD"" for Jennifer Morrison and it's nice to see Kevin Dunn be at least somewhat amusing and not completely irritating like he was in the Transformers movies. It was crazy seeing Kurt Angle in this though, especially as a Russian. It's as if he was playing a modern day version of Ivan Drago who took up MMA instead of boxing and never had anything to say about it.Warrior did have its shortcomings though. It is a bit clich&eacute; and predictable. The whole movie is centered on these two brothers finally fighting in the cage and you can probably guess who's going to win; is it going to be the guy that breaks every rule imaginable with a chip on his shoulder or the kind, warm school teacher with a family that everybody loves? But the whole experience was about more than just who would win that fight though. Thankfully there's a bit of a deeper meaning to it. The camera work got really annoying at times as well though. It was as if it was attempting to go for this gritty, realistic style and it just came off as somebody not being able to hold a camera steadily or terrible perspectives that blocked more of the shot than anything else.Warrior packs one hell of a punch. Its incredible, emotional, and powerful story is told by a talented cast amongst a flurry of knockout punches and submission holds that'll force you to tap to the spectacular journey you just experienced. Nick Nolte gives a scene stealing performance while Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton pick up the scraps and tend to take pride in delivering what Nolte couldn't follow up on. While Warrior does have its flaws, it's essentially to MMA what The Fighter was to boxing. In the end, Warrior is surprisingly heartfelt and delivers a wonderful message.",4,Emotional and exceptional,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,4248,"[""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'MMA', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'sport', ""'m"", 'also', 'fairly', 'certain', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Gavin', ""O'Connor"", 'directed', 'film', 'now', 'be', 'honest', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'getting', 'top', 'billing', 'Hardy', 'been', 'awhile', 'most', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'guy', 'much', 'thought', 'started', 'showing', 'up', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'films', 'Bronson', 'was', 'movie', 'made', 'admire', 'talent', 'Warrior', 'fairly', 'outstanding', 'general', 'anyway', 'could', 'also', 'give', 'even', 'more', 'weight', 'Hardy', 'name.Paddy', 'Conlon', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'lost', 'everything', 'when', 'was', 'drunk', 'wife', 'died', 'bedside', 'sons', 'cut', 'off', 'almost', 'completely', 'younger', 'son', 'Tommy', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'up', 'doorstep', 'one', 'day', 'being', 'army', 'wanting', 'nothing', 'more', 'coach', 'big', 'Spartan', 'MMA', 'tournament', 'coming', 'up', 'Tommy', 'withdrawn', ""n't"", 'want', 'share', 'anything', 'life', 'out', 'reason', 'Meanwhile', 'Paddy', 'other', 'son', 'Brendan', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'facing', 'foreclosure', 'house', 'was', 'suspended', 'teaching', 'job', 'being', 'caught', 'fighting', 'parking', 'lot', 'strip', 'club', 'Brendan', 'tournament', 'hopes', 'keeping', 'family', 'afloat', 'Tommy', 'purpose', 'something', 'do', 'army', 'brethren', 'Warrior', 'more', 'story', 'Conlon', 'family', 'struggling', 'find', 'forgive', 'other', 'rather', 'who', 'will', 'win', 'massive', 'MMA', 'tournament.The', 'cast', 'really', 'phenomenal', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'outshine', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'as', 'far', 'performances', 'go', 'Hardy', 'Edgerton', 'are', 'beating', 'crap', 'other', 'cage', 'Nolte', 'amazing', 'emotion', 'can', 'tell', 'broken', 'man', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'track', 'everything', 'be', 'blowing', 'up', 'face', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'really', 'up', 'whole', 'underdog', 'thing', 'physics', 'teacher', 'MMA', 'tournament', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'Edgerton', 'emotion', 'as', 'well', 'performance', 'otherwise', 'forgettable', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'typical', 'tough', 'guy', 'Nothing', 'going', 'stand', 'way', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'talk', 'can', 'help', 'absolute', 'beast', 'cage', 'lead', 'actor', 'movie', 'own', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'have', 'bases', 'covered', 'three', 'make', 'everything', 'come', 'together.Some', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'interesting', 'was', 'intriguing', 'film', 'follow', 'up', 'leaving', 'House', 'MD', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'nice', 'see', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'be', 'least', 'somewhat', 'amusing', 'not', 'completely', 'irritating', 'was', 'Transformers', 'movies', 'was', 'crazy', 'seeing', 'Kurt', 'Angle', 'though', 'especially', 'Russian', 'was', 'playing', 'modern', 'day', 'version', 'Ivan', 'Drago', 'who', 'took', 'up', 'MMA', 'instead', 'boxing', 'never', 'had', 'anything', 'say', 'it.Warrior', 'did', 'have', 'shortcomings', 'bit', 'clich', 'eacute', 'predictable', 'whole', 'movie', 'centered', 'two', 'brothers', 'finally', 'fighting', 'cage', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'who', 'going', 'win', 'going', 'be', 'guy', 'rule', 'imaginable', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'kind', 'warm', 'school', 'teacher', 'family', 'everybody', 'whole', 'experience', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'who', 'would', 'win', 'fight', 'Thankfully', 'bit', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'camera', 'work', 'got', 'really', 'annoying', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'was', 'attempting', 'go', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'style', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'somebody', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'hold', 'camera', 'steadily', 'terrible', 'perspectives', 'blocked', 'more', 'shot', 'anything', 'else.Warrior', 'one', 'hell', 'punch', 'incredible', 'emotional', 'powerful', 'story', 'told', 'talented', 'cast', 'flurry', 'knockout', 'punches', 'submission', ""'ll"", 'force', 'tap', 'spectacular', 'journey', 'just', 'experienced', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'scene', 'stealing', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'up', 'scraps', 'tend', 'take', 'pride', 'delivering', 'what', 'Nolte', 'could', ""n't"", 'follow', 'up', 'Warrior', 'have', 'flaws', 'essentially', 'MMA', 'what', 'Fighter', 'was', 'boxing', 'end', 'Warrior', 'surprisingly', 'heartfelt', 'wonderful', 'message']",N/A

""Tommy"" is a loser, a Marine deserter using his dead mother's maiden name. Tommy has enough anger for a battalion of PTSD veterans, and a special reserve of anger for his father, a boozer who apparently abused Tommy's mother until she ran away with Tommy in his teens. Tommy has a Pittsburg PA accent to match Sly Stallone's, and a nihilistic slouch to shame Jon Voight. But Tommy is a Raging Bull in the cage, a born batterer who taps out his first two opponents in the ""Sparta"" tournament without breaking a sweat. He looks like the underdog you'd want good odds on.The other underdog is Brendan, a happily married family guy, a high school physics teacher whose students actually treat him civilly. He's well-spoken, decent, personable, but his home is about to be ripped away from him by a bank foreclosure. He loses his teaching job when he wins a MMA bout at a local strip club. Despite his wife's anxieties, he decides that training for MMA matches with reasonable purses is his best bet to save his home. The ""Rocky"" side of him will become apparent when he gets bashed and bloodied to hell and back fight after fight yet always comes up with a way to win. In spite of his calm teaching demeanor and general nice-guy manner, Brendan also has a seething pot of anger against his father, with whom he chose to stay when his mother jumped ship.But the gimmick here is that Tommy and Brendan have the same unforgiven father and the same dead mother. Is that clear enough? They're brothers who were separated as teens, one with Mom and one with Pop. They're ""alienated"". In fact, they seemingly hate each other's guts. If it isn't obvious to you, dear cinemaphile, that the two brothers will advance through the tournament and duke it out in the final scenes, you'd better stick with the films in the ""family entertainment"" section. The suspense of this film is over which of the brothers will 'cave' to his emotions and throw the fight to the other ...There's a lot of formula boxing film stuff in ""Warrior"" -- stuff that plays the same whether the combatants are MMArtists, mud wrestlers, gladiators, or barroom brawlers. The only thing that saves the film is the grittily convincing acting of Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as the Conlon brothers. Good ol' Nick Nolte does a decent impersonation of an emotionally shattered failure of a father who has been twelve-step sober now for 100O days. The acting is strong enough to carry the film despite its twin flaws of improbability and predictability. It gets five stars from me for the very simple reason that I enjoyed it. We needn't worry about whether I was in an unusually good mood.Some reviewers have declared that the MMA fight scenes were poorly done. I wouldn't know. I've never seen an MMA bout, not even on TV, nothing more than a minute or two while channel surfing. I kinda thought it was comparable to ""wrestling"" on TV back in the 1950s, more theater than sport, but apparently I was mistaken. People are really doing grave bodily damage to each other for your and my entertainment. Me, I'd rather watch my ten-year-old niece's ballet recital, and I'd much rather listen to a Beethoven symphony. But Beethoven makes an audible appearance in this film; Brendan's  trainer uses Beethoven recordings to teach his fighters self-composure, and Brendan enters the cage to the tune of Beethoven's Ode to Joy. Meanwhile, Father Conlon soothes his nerves by listening to audio tapes of Moby Dick. It reminds me of Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood quoting William Butler Yeats in ""Million Dollar Baby""....Wait! I get it! Something for everyone!

1325378,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0034G4P94,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","WARRIOR is one of the finest films of the year - and that is a statement coming from one who does not like violent films.  The film does deal with UFC fighting, a mania incomprehensible to most), but it is more an extraordinary story about the magnetism of family.  Writer Gavin O'Connor (with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman) also directs this intense film and his sensitivity in bringing out brilliant performances from everyone in his cast is simply amazing.  This is a monumental achievement worthy of Academy Award consideration.Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) has returned from a tour with the USMC in Iraq where he ran away after saving his fellow marines in a near fatal situation, witnessed the death of his closest buddy Manny, and went AWOL from the stress: he returned to the US to make sure Manny's family was cared for.  An ex fighter, Tommy drinks and does drugs and finally returns to his father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) to gain new training as a fighter.  The Conlon family history is tragic - the mother took Tommy away from Pittsburgh hoping her older son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) would follow - escaping the spiraling alcoholism of the father.  Tommy moved with his mother who subsequently dies: Brendon stayed with his father and the family ties seem to have been forever broken.  When Tommy returns Paddy is 1000 days sober, but instead of love for this father Tommy loathes him and only wants his expertise as a trainer.  Paddy consents and the two begin training at Paddy's old friend Colt Boyd's (Maximiliano Hern&aacute;ndez) Gym.  In Philadelphia Brendan is a high school Physics teacher and has married Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and they have two little girls, one of whom has renal damage that has been so costly that both parents must each hold down two jobs to survive.  Brendan happens upon a Mixed Martial Arts fight (he spends his nights as a bouncer in a club making very little money) and decides that the money he can gain through fighting may save his home from going into foreclosure): he fights, and wins $200.  When he shows up at school to teach he is bruised and cut and is suspended without pay for disgracing the school (the principal - Kevin Dunn - hates to lose his finest teacher). With a dim financial outlook Tess hesitantly agrees for Brendan to re-enter fighting for money and Brendan hires his old friend Frank Campagna (Frank Grillo) to train him.There is a much publicized tournament for the championship in Mixed Martial Arts in Atlantic city and through many strange coincidences the two brothers end up in the final fight -  fighting each other. The end is brilliant in its understatement, not stooping to resolve all family problems,  but at the same time having the courage to show how powerful is the love of two brothers no matter how different their lives.  Both Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are brilliant as the brothers and Nick Nolte gives the performance of his career.  Every character created by this extraordinary cast is pitch perfect.  For this viewer this is one of the most moving films that has been released in a very long time.

But the only issue that I really had with that film is that it was a little too reliant on the nostalgia factor to get its point driven home. WARRIOR doesn't suffer from that. This is very much a film set in the here and now, and that gives it more immediacy in regards to the world its set in. Edgerton's character is on the verge of losing his house and the prize money is the only thing that can save it. Hardy (who, along with Michael Fassbender, is one of the hardest-working men in showbiz) is a man with a mission. His mission is very single-minded and anyone in his way is merely an obstacle. But what makes this tale so much more vital and what makes these adversaries so compelling is their famililal bond. When you have a film like this, you generally have a clear hero and a clear villain. Edgerton seems more heroic in his underdog, can-he-or-can't-he tale, and Hardy seems more villainous with his rock-solid body, crushing blows and his anger constantly near his surface.When you cut below the surface and get to their intent, you can see that both of them deserve to win this tournament, and that both of them have similarly honorable reasons for fighting. The great thing about this film is that it never forces you to take sides. You care about both Edgerton and Hardy, and that's a very difficult thing to pull off in a film like this. Nick Nolte, surprisingly to me, was a tiny bit of a weak link in this film, not so much because of his performance, but because his character, the formerly drunk and abusive father and grizzled veteran trainer who, after losing everyone, turns his life around into sobriety and constant apology... the character is far too much of a trope in this genre of films. It was the only part of the film that felt a little false to me.Otherwise though, WARRIOR, with its terrific performances, smart storytelling and its suspeneful atmosphere as it builds towards its inevitable conclusion and the raw emotion and physicality of the final fight just drains you and makes this similar to FIELD OF DREAMS as kind of a ""chick flick"" for guys.

I guess for me, being I have two brothers, in an Irish household, we had our fights and love ea other dearly, but we sure had our differences and struggles, especially with themes in this movie, like alcohol abuse, anger, etc... this movie made me cry rediculous but also grabbed at me being a father of two girls myself and also reignited my desire to get back into shape and start excersising again. While I'm not a fan of UFC fights, I think it's too much about the violence or brutality more so than the actual techniques to the mixed martial arts. I AM however, intrigued by MMA techniques, especially in my new workout regimens. They're great for burning cals and shedding weight, and just jazzing yourself up to feel better.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[4, 4]","Here's a review I never dreamed I would write, for three good reasons: 1) I don't like blood sports. 2) I avoid sports clich&eacute;s. 3) I'm not fond of Nick Nolte. I don't think I would have liked this 2011 movie quite so much if I hadn't watched the extras on the DVD. They provided some insight for a rabid MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) non-fan (ME!), which helped get me past the blood and the pain those folks inflict on one another and try to understand the underlying skills. Sorta like football: Two teams of over-grown hulks pummeling each other into hamburger, but there IS some skill involved, right?Sooooo... Bottom line: 1) I still don't like blood sports. 2) Clich&eacute;s become clich&eacute;s because on a very basic level, they work. 3) I still don't like Nick Nolte. But the wrenching final match stayed with me long enough to warrant a review for Amazon.com.We have a pair of brothers. When they were children, one split with Mom when the marriage broke up, the other stayed with the alcoholic father. Neither had an easy time of it. Now, one is a returning Marine vet, the other is a physics teacher with a wife and children. Through a series of clich&eacute;s, they both end up back in the MME cage, fighting their way toward the championship. By the time they have come this far, we want BOTH of them to win!We have:* Nick Nolte (""Three Fugitives"") Let's get him out of the way first. He hits all his marks and delivers the goods, I just don't like the goods he delivers. You know, the contrite former alcoholic who is really, really sorry. I agree with his sons: Talk is cheap, but the damage is done. We can't un-ring the bell here, folks!* Tom Hardy (""This Means War"") is the former Marine. The American accent used by this British-born bloke convinced me he was from Pittsburgh! This war veteran seethes with hostility and rage: perfect for the MMA cage!* Joel Edgerton (""Kinky Boots"") no trace of Down Under in this guy's American accent either! His character is sweet, a much-loved high-school physics teacher with a loyal wife and two sweet little girls.* Jennifer Morrison (""Star Trek"" 2009) is that loyal wife. She understands the very real danger her husband is exposed to and does NOT want another ride in an ambulance!* Frank Grillo (""The Grey"") is a long-time family friend and coach who knows the family dynamics at play here. He has a good reason why Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" is the entrance music for his fighter.There is a lot of showmanship involved in MMA matches and this movie manages to capture it. Luckily the matches only bookend the REAL issues at stake here and both of the lead actors are skilled enough to capture our attention and our allegiance, to the point that we actually CARE what happens in the cage.It was that last round that got me!",4,That Last Round Got Me,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,2790,"['Here', 'review', 'never', 'dreamed', 'would', 'write', 'three', 'good', 'reasons', '1', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'blood', 'sports', '2', 'avoid', 'sports', 'clich', 'eacute', '3', ""'m"", 'not', 'fond', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'liked', '2011', 'movie', 'quite', 'so', 'much', 'had', ""n't"", 'watched', 'extras', 'DVD', 'provided', 'insight', 'rabid', 'MMA', 'Mixed', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'non-fan', 'ME', 'helped', 'get', 'blood', 'pain', 'folks', 'inflict', 'one', 'try', 'understand', 'underlying', 'skills', 'Sorta', 'football', 'Two', 'teams', 'over-grown', 'hulks', 'pummeling', 'other', 'hamburger', 'skill', 'involved', 'right', 'Sooooo', 'Bottom', 'line', '1', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'blood', 'sports', '2', 'Clich', 'eacute', 'become', 'clich', 'eacute', 'very', 'basic', 'level', 'work', '3', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'wrenching', 'final', 'match', 'stayed', 'long', 'enough', 'warrant', 'review', 'Amazon.com.We', 'have', 'pair', 'brothers', 'When', 'were', 'children', 'one', 'split', 'Mom', 'when', 'marriage', 'broke', 'up', 'other', 'stayed', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'had', 'easy', 'time', 'Now', 'one', 'returning', 'Marine', 'vet', 'other', 'physics', 'teacher', 'wife', 'children', 'series', 'clich', 'eacute', 'end', 'up', 'back', 'MME', 'cage', 'fighting', 'way', 'championship', 'time', 'have', 'come', 'far', 'want', 'win', 'have', '*', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Three', 'Fugitives', 'Let', 'get', 'way', 'first', 'marks', 'goods', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'goods', 'know', 'contrite', 'former', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'really', 'really', 'sorry', 'agree', 'sons', 'Talk', 'cheap', 'damage', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'un-ring', 'bell', 'here', 'folks', '*', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Means', 'War', 'former', 'Marine', 'American', 'accent', 'used', 'British-born', 'bloke', 'convinced', 'was', 'Pittsburgh', 'war', 'veteran', 'seethes', 'hostility', 'rage', 'perfect', 'MMA', 'cage', '*', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'Kinky', 'Boots', 'trace', 'Down', 'guy', 'American', 'accent', 'either', 'character', 'sweet', 'much-loved', 'high-school', 'physics', 'teacher', 'loyal', 'wife', 'two', 'sweet', 'little', 'girls', '*', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'Star', 'Trek', '2009', 'loyal', 'wife', 'very', 'real', 'danger', 'husband', 'exposed', 'NOT', 'want', 'ride', 'ambulance', '*', 'Frank', 'Grillo', 'Grey', 'long-time', 'family', 'friend', 'coach', 'who', 'family', 'dynamics', 'play', 'here', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'Beethoven', 'Ode', 'Joy', 'entrance', 'music', 'fighter.There', 'lot', 'showmanship', 'involved', 'MMA', 'matches', 'movie', 'capture', 'Luckily', 'matches', 'only', 'bookend', 'REAL', 'issues', 'stake', 'here', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'skilled', 'enough', 'capture', 'attention', 'allegiance', 'point', 'actually', 'CARE', 'what', 'cage.It', 'was', 'last', 'round', 'got']",N/A

1325398,AJ0LVMSVJ0CN1,B0034G4P94,Joan Burton,"[0, 0]","One of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.  What I loved about the movie besides the writing, acting, direction, etc. is that there wasn't a single person shot, or blown up in the movie.  It's been a week since I have seen this movie and I can't stop thinking about it.  This movie isn't really about mixed martial arts it's about a dysfunctional family and what people will do to protect their families or military brother during desperate times.  I thought this was just another boxing type of movie like Rocky but it is so much more than that.  Yes the fight scenes are exciting, amazing and gruesome but it's the dynamic of the family.  The relationship between an absentee alcoholic father and his two sons.  Nick Nolte was nominated for every award for his role as Paddy Conlon (the father).  Joel Edgarton is also amazing.  But british actor Tom Hardy is outstanding.  I cannot say enough about Tom Hardy.  In my opinion he replaced Marlon Brando, DeNiro, etc.  This movie should have been nominated as best picture and Tom Hardy and Joel Edgarton should have also been nominated, not just Nick Nolte.  If a movie can make my 21 year old tough son cry and show emotion both times he saw this movie, then this is one of the greatest movies ever.  Yes this movie does use some standard hollywood cliches but the outstanding writing, acting and direction of this movie totally melts those hollywood cliches completely away.  If you only watch Quentin Tarantino crappy movies then this is not for you.  By the way, QT is one of the most overrated directors in Hollywood.  Guy Ritchie is a much better director than QT.  Snatch was brilliant.  I love the way he directs movies.  I don't need to see someone's face or head actually being shot off.  I can use my imagination.  I wish that Guy Ritchie had directed Pulp Fiction or any of QT's movies.  They would have been 100 times better.  Personally I think QT should just write scripts and leave the directing to actual professionals like Scorsese.  Scorsese never glorifies violence.  He uses violence to do the opposite.  Every violent character in his movies you despise they are never glorified.  He makes the mafia look like serial killing A-holes, which is exactly what they are.  QT 100% glorifies violence.  I have no desire to waste my money on a &#34;joke&#34; movie about slavery directed and written by QT.  Truly laughable and a slap in the face to African Americans and what they endured during slavery in this country.  Hollywood would never agree to a &#34;joke&#34; movie written about the Holocaust.  It disgusts me that Harvey Weinstein produced this movie.  They are actually making action figures for Django.  Warrior has violence in it but it's NOT gratuitous!!!  This movie doesn't insult my intelligence.  I highly recommend this movie and so does my 21 year old son.

What I'll say is that I went into this film not expecting much more than a ""Boxer"" ""Rocky"" feel good film. I rented it because it looked like a halfway decent way to spend a couple of hours with. I read some reviews to juice myself up for it. I'll admit that I'm kind of jaded to these sort of films and I sure as hell didn't expect to actually like, let alone love it but that's exactly what happened. Believe the hype. Rocky is my all time favorite movie not for its intelligence but for the fact that its main characters felt real, I could truly identify with them completely. And what I especially love about this film is that it used the human element and not CGI or 3D to make me feel this way.Haven't seen a lot of movies at the theater this year. Frankly, haven't been any that I could get myself up to driving to, and plunking down 10 bucks to see. But this is one I would have paid to see. A shame that it didn't receive the publicity that it deserves. What it does deserve is recognition at Oscar time. Best actors, take your pick. Best supporting actor, definitely Nolte. I damn near, no I did, cry, because of Nolte's performance. With all of the comparisons to Rocky, I still can't say this movie eclipses it.

1325402,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B0034G4P94,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[1, 2]","I'd rank this film up there with 1976's ""Rocky"":  It's tough, violent, and brutal, but it has underlying gentleness and heart.I probably wouldn't have gone to see this film had I not already seen Tom Hardy in ""Bronson"" (my one-word review of his performance in that: ""WOW!"").  Hardy is impressive both as an actor and as someone who can physically transform himself.  He added some 40 pounds of muscle for this role, looking quite fearsome and imposing.  Hard to believe this is the same guy who played ""Twombly"" in ""Black Hawk Down"" -- there is almost no resemblance.Hardy and actor Joel Edgerton play estranged brothers who, via different paths and with different motivations, enter a winner-take-all mixed martial arts tournament.  Both brothers were trained in their youth by their father Paddy (Nick Nolte, excellent as always) and both resent him because of his abusive, alcoholic nature.The martial arts fighting gives the film its energy and action, but the family dynamic gives the film its heart.  The film never stoops to weepy melodrama, as many other sports movies with similar concepts have.  The characters -- even the supporting ones -- are sufficiently fleshed out and believable:  they are the connective tissue keeping the entire body in good shape.There are one or two moments in the cage that stretch believability just a tad, but they are essential to moving the story to its inevitable showdown.  Knowing what's at stake for the two finalists, I think we can forgive the filmmakers for that.Director Gavin O'Connor proved with his 2004 movie ""Miracle"" (about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team battling the Soviets) that he knows how to make a great sports movie that puts the characters at center stage.  O'Connor has done it again with ""Warrior"".Highly recommended.

1325403,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B0034G4P94,John's Horror Corner,"[2, 3]","This story follows an emotionally scarred family trio.  Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is a high school physics teacher who returns to his former profession (MMA fighter) for extra money to keep his home afloat from foreclosure.  When this financially desperate decision results in his suspension without pay, he has no choice but to engage in mixed martial arts full time.  Meanwhile Brendan's brother Tommy (Tom Hardy) returns home from serving with the Marines, arriving at the doorstep of his father (Nick Nolte as Paddy Conlon) and eventually seeking him out as a trainer for a grand prix MMA tournament which will recognize the toughest middleweight fighter in the world...the tournament is called Sparta!This already has all the trappings of a good sports fighting movie.  However, we soon learn that Tommy has not a warm ounce in his heart for his alcoholic father, who trains Tommy desperately hoping to find some vestige of reciprocal love in his unflaggingly resentful son.  Paddy also yearns to reconnect with Brendan, who shuns his destroyed father despite the fact that one of his little girls has never met her grandfather.  As if this wasn't enough, the enmity Tommy feels for his older brother is yet more vicious than that reserved for his father.By composition this is an anti-fight-movie, but somehow it strikes me as the greatest fight movie since Rocky!  The standard formula of a boxing movie relies on several key elements, all such rules of which are broken in Warrior.  1) Extensive training scenes demonstrate the fighter's hardship and devotion--training scenes in this film are minimal and seem more informative about mixed martial arts than demonstrative of the hardship or devotion.  2) The fighter turns to his family for support to overcome the training and insecurity of the upcoming fight--the only family under the lens here is a sundered father and sons who all turn to the fights to escape their family's general paucity of love and forgiveness.  3) The fighter has a resistant loved one and his relationship is tested--Brendan's wife, while clearly not a fan of the idea, makes no concerted effort or threat to keep her husband out of the ring.  4) The actual fights are few in number and serve as highlight montages, building up to post-victory catharsis--these fights are extensive, numerous, and view reel-to-reel as if complete, with most catharsis delivered ""during"" the fights!  5) The fighter faces an unlikeable (or at least very arrogant in the case of Rocky's Apollo Creed) or even evil antagonist--the antagonist in this film is the Conlon brothers' unwillingness to forgive.  The single major element that the classics have in common with Warrior is that Brendan is the ultimate underdog and, like Rocky Balboa, fights from the heart.  You never think he should be able to defeat his opponents, but you believe it when he does it!While this movie is not so much about who wins the fight, it is still very much about victory.  Nick Nolte plays the damaged, AA-devout, alcoholic Paddy to perfection.  He drove his family apart and crumbles whenever he is reminded of the monster he once was and is horrified by the thought of becoming that monster again.  He serves as the bone on which his children sharpen their fangs.  Amid this loveless viciousness, this film manages to pull the audience from feeling irreparably beaten, to excited and motivated, and ultimately inspired--perhaps awestruck.  The fights were thrilling, shocking and technically stunning.  On the softer side, my throat tightened up more times than I care to admit and culminated in some tears in the same five minutes that I was screaming at the screen during the final fight as if I had money riding on it.  Between the exquisitely written characters, engaging fights and solid guy-cry, I can't remember feeling so affected...and it felt amazing.This movie isn't for MMA fans, it's for everyone.Don't miss this one.

The conflict between them plays out very well because of how great they play their characters. The MMA fight scenes are realistic and exciting; Tom Hardy is especially vicious in his scenes. What I really liked about the film was how it changes the sports movie formula. Most sports films have one underdog athlete that ends up winning. This film has two; it made me question who i was rooting for and why? The ending was great, brilliant acting, it has amazing music, and a heartfelt story.Overall, I highly recommend watching Warrior.

1325408,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0034G4P94,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 2]","Nick Nolte deserves to be nominated for, and possibly win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His heartbreaking performance as Paddy Conlon is not only one of the best performances of 2011, but a fighting comeback for the actor in every sense of the word. This is easily the most surprising resurgence of a once-great actor since Mickey Rourke appeared in The Wrestler and Nolte's performance is equally powerful.Opening in theaters back in September, Warrior quickly disappeared after grossing only $13 million domestically. Mixed-martial-arts isn't exactly mainstream, the two lead actors aren't ""stars"" yet, and Warrior was marketed no differently from every other film of this sort. In the last few years, audiences have already seen The Wrestler and The Fighter rendering Warrior superfluous. Critics were good to it, but not good enough and the film has now been left to gather its following on Blu-Ray. I had heard the kind words about it, but watched it for no other reason than entertainment value. Imagine my surprise...Warrior is possibly one of the most underrated films of the year and certainly one of the best. It appears as nothing special, but it's an absolute knockout.The film begins with an emotional confrontation that establishes the type of acting we'll see throughout. Paddy Conlon, coming up on his thousandth day of sobriety, comes home to find his adult son Tommy Rearden (Tom Hardy) sitting on his doorstep. Their relationship is obviously strained over Paddy's past abusive behavior and Tommy doesn't believe that he's changed. The next day Tommy is involved in a bout with a professional fighter and a video of it goes viral on the internet. There's an upcoming mixed martial arts tournament with a grand prize of $5 million dollars. Tommy begrudgingly asks Paddy to train him, saying ""that was one thing you were good at.""Meanwhile, Tommy's older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is a high school physics teacher with a wife and two daughters. A former UFC fighter, Brendan is struggling financially and finds that he has three months to pay the bank before his house is foreclosed. His wife is opposed to him fighting for money, but after he's suspended from teaching he's left with no alternative.Warrior brilliantly spends the first hour following both brothers separately, taking time to establish these characters. Hour one is straight drama, while hour two brings on the action without sacrificing what grabbed our interest in the first place. Director Gavin O'Connor, who co-wrote the screenplay, is a director to watch for his masterful ability to handle character drama against the backdrop of men pummeling each other. He's made a movie that will appeal to both thinking moviegoers and...other moviegoers. More impressive is that Warrior uses the conventional, clich&eacute;d character arcs (strained father-son relationships, sibling rivalry, alcoholism) and story arcs (financial struggles, redemption) that make up this genre and spins them into a compelling, relatable drama that transcends these barriers to create a film that never feels too familiar. Warrior has all the makings of a good movie, but those involved elevate the material to greatness. Not bad considering it tackles themes and plot devices that we've seen endlessly since Rocky debuted in 1976.I know little about MMA, except that it appears pretty intense and leaves little mystery as to why some of the fighting scenes are so brief. The first fight with Hardy is well-choreographed, quick, and exciting. It makes you want to see more and then it makes you wait. The scenes that come later are not only emotionally involving, but quite simply...badass. This is coming from someone ignorant of MMA and with no interest in watching UFC or anything of that nature. These scenes are exciting and triumphant, complimented by great editing and hindered only by the use of shaky-cam. It's not as overbearing as it has been in other films, but it's not necessary either. It doesn't bring anyone closer to the action or make you feel more involved as an audience member; it's just a headache-inducing distraction. This fad of using it for action sequences needs to die a quick death.Warrior provides two thoughtful dramatic conflicts that make the eventual climax all the more riveting. In movies like Rocky, Raging Bull, The Wrestler, and The Fighter you know who to root for while Warrior leaves you torn. Hardy and Edgerton are totally separated and do not share the screen until over an hour in. This confrontational scene is a tad melodramatic, some of the dialogue is shaky, but it gets the point across. It's just too bad the brawn loses some of its brain in this scene. Questionable execution of this scene aside, the performances are fantastic all-around. Tom Hardy is an animal and his rage-filled, sensitive performance is a great precursor to what we can expect from his portrayal as Bane later this year. Hardy's previous roles show his physical commitment and he's become very large and imposing here. It's not just the muscle he's accumulated that makes this a great performances, but the way he's able to convey Tommy's deep, emotional wounds using his eyes. Tommy isn't much of a talker, but his eyes speak volumes. In the emotional scenes, you can see quiet suffering behind them and in the film's climax there's just pure, animalistic rage. It's award-worthy for sure and a reminder of what great things Hardy will do as an actor. Nolte is heartbreaking, emotive, and sincere, playing a familiar character but using his own troubled history to add another level of pathos. If the Academy doesn't honor Albert Brooks for his role in Drive, they should be ashamed for not awarding Nolte. Brooks played against type and created a memorable villain. Nolte has made a comeback, reestablishing himself as an actor of indispensable talent in a performance that brought tears to my eyes more than once.Warrior deserves more accolades. It never goes for easy sentiment and tells a complicated story against a solid, entertaining backdrop. It hits challenging emotional notes, inspiring a whirlwind of emotions that range from crying to cheering. With a stunningly poignant climax and an ending that gives you just the right amount of closure; few films of 2011 succeed on this level. Warrior is great drama, great action, and great entertainment, one of the best, most powerful films of the year.GRADE: A",5,Surprisingly One of the Year's Best Films,1325376000,"01 1,

1325409,A3RS0HI0DUS4GV,B0034G4P94,J. Schell,"[2, 7]","This movie had many things that bugged me.  Someone recommended this because I like watching UFC but the MMA in this isn't particularly compelling.  The problem with the fights is the camera work.  I don't think any of the punches actually get completely shown.  They either show just the guy throwing punches or just the other guy taking flailed punches from an unseen attacker.  The fence is always in the way and it feels like they've intentionally kept most of the action only half frame.  UFC had the smart idea of putting camera men up on the fence...  The whole movie is shot in a shaky, hand-cam style, often from a slightly too low angle looking up at the characters.  (Or maybe it just seems like a low angle to me because I'm not really short.)The MMA matches are inaccurate.  Or maybe the rules are different than what I'm used to.  It's my understanding that you have to intelligently defend yourself at all times.  At least a few rounds in this movie end with one guy pummeling another guy who just lays there and eats it until he gets saved by the bell.  Any ref would stop that after like 5 seconds.  Also, while it's called a choke hold, it doesn't cut off your air, it cuts off blood to the head.  Properly applied (and this one looked pretty deep), this will knock you out very quickly.  You certainly don't have 30 seconds to ""just hold on"" until the end of the round.  The submissions in this movie involve more dramatic straining and pulling than I've ever seen.  It's really a matter of leverage.  Only if you're doing the hold wrong would you have to pull super hard.Going into a MMA match without a support team is the height of idiocy.  Luckily most of that guy's matches didn't last the whole first round or you'd see him sitting there like an idiot between rounds.  Where's he going to get water?  Ice?  Clean up any cuts?  Well I guess that character wasn't super intelligent anyway.My final criticism is that in one of the early scenes the physics teacher has a student demonstrate breaking a piece of wood with a bat. He tells the class ""if you have enough acceleration you might have a chance of breaking the object at rest.""  This is absolute nonsense.  He's trying to teach F=MA; he should say ""if you have a strong enough force"".  And the baseball bat is a terrible example of a force anyway because it's not accelerating, it hits with a specific velocity.  Way to confuse the students!  I'm glad he got suspended from teaching, he's a horrible teacher.  On that note, can you really suspend a teacher for competing in a MMA match on his own time?  That seems unlikely.  Don't teachers have unions?  I guess it's about as unlikely as a physics teacher in MMA in the first place.If you can get past these specific criticisms the rest is sort of a low budget, less compelling Rocky.",2,a (very) poor man's Rocky if you can get past a few things,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,2815,"['movie', 'had', 'many', 'things', 'bugged', 'Someone', 'recommended', 'like', 'watching', 'UFC', 'MMA', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'compelling', 'problem', 'fights', 'camera', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'punches', 'actually', 'get', 'completely', 'shown', 'show', 'just', 'guy', 'throwing', 'punches', 'just', 'other', 'guy', 'taking', 'flailed', 'punches', 'unseen', 'attacker', 'fence', 'always', 'way', ""'ve"", 'intentionally', 'kept', 'most', 'action', 'only', 'half', 'frame', 'UFC', 'had', 'smart', 'idea', 'putting', 'camera', 'men', 'up', 'fence', 'whole', 'movie', 'shot', 'shaky', 'hand-cam', 'style', 'often', 'slightly', 'too', 'low', 'angle', 'looking', 'up', 'characters', 'maybe', 'just', 'low', 'angle', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'short', 'MMA', 'matches', 'are', 'inaccurate', 'maybe', 'rules', 'are', 'different', 'what', ""'m"", 'used', 'understanding', 'have', 'intelligently', 'defend', 'times', 'least', 'few', 'rounds', 'movie', 'end', 'one', 'guy', 'pummeling', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'saved', 'bell', 'ref', 'would', 'stop', '5', 'seconds', 'Also', 'called', 'choke', 'hold', ""n't"", 'cut', 'off', 'air', 'off', 'blood', 'head', 'Properly', 'applied', 'one', 'looked', 'pretty', 'deep', 'will', 'knock', 'out', 'very', 'quickly', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '30', 'seconds', 'just', 'hold', 'end', 'round', 'submissions', 'movie', 'involve', 'more', 'dramatic', 'straining', 'pulling', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'really', 'matter', 'leverage', 'Only', ""'re"", 'doing', 'hold', 'wrong', 'would', 'have', 'pull', 'super', 'hard.Going', 'MMA', 'match', 'support', 'team', 'height', 'idiocy', 'Luckily', 'most', 'guy', 'matches', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'whole', 'first', 'round', ""'d"", 'see', 'sitting', 'there', 'idiot', 'rounds', 'Where', 'going', 'get', 'water', 'Ice', 'Clean', 'up', 'cuts', 'Well', 'guess', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'super', 'intelligent', 'anyway.My', 'final', 'criticism', 'one', 'early', 'scenes', 'physics', 'teacher', 'student', 'demonstrate', 'breaking', 'piece', 'wood', 'bat', 'class', 'have', 'enough', 'acceleration', 'might', 'have', 'chance', 'breaking', 'object', 'rest', 'absolute', 'nonsense', 'trying', 'teach', 'F=MA', 'should', 'say', 'have', 'strong', 'enough', 'force', 'baseball', 'bat', 'terrible', 'example', 'force', 'anyway', 'not', 'accelerating', 'specific', 'velocity', 'Way', 'confuse', 'students', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'suspended', 'teaching', 'horrible', 'teacher', 'note', 'can', 'really', 'suspend', 'teacher', 'competing', 'MMA', 'match', 'own', 'time', 'unlikely', 'Do', ""n't"", 'teachers', 'have', 'unions', 'guess', 'as', 'unlikely', 'physics', 'teacher', 'MMA', 'first', 'place.If', 'can', 'get', 'specific', 'criticisms', 'rest', 'sort', 'low', 'budget', 'less', 'compelling', 'Rocky']",N/A

Never thought the darned thing would have me riveted to my seat.  The acting was incredible.  I don't recall seeing Joel Edgerton before, but I'll be looking for him now.  The little I've seen of Tom Hardy (Lawless) I've liked and Nick Nolte has never disappointed.  Tom Hardy played with such anger and controlled rage that you couldn't take your eyes off him.  Joel Edgerton as Brendan really stole my heart, though.  Although his wife (the always watchable Jennifer Morrison) was willing to sacrifice their home to keep him safe, she still supported him and I liked that.  Having a childhood similar to his, though, I could understand the importance of making sure his family had a home and the lenghts he was willing to go to do this.

It has a great compelling story involving two estranged brothers who through fate find themselves in the same MMA tournament, one fighting for his financial survival and the other out of the bottomless depth of deep bitter anger.  The story is captivating, the acting is first-rate; the fighting scenes are completely realistic, and the direction is crisp and clean.  There are no wasted scenes here; the director has a great scrip, great acting, and he knows what to do with both.  What results is a film that will engage your heart and emotions to such a degree that when the final climactic scenes arrive, you will literally be on the edge of your seat in anticipation.  It is that good.The casting for this film is a true knockout.  Nick Nolte is superb as the delinquent, alcoholic father of the warriors who is trying to pull together what is left of his life and make peace with his sons.  High praise for both Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy who carry the film on their muscular shoulders and big hearts.  Their fight scenes are as realistic as have ever been seen on film; it is  truly as though one is watching on pay per view.  Kurt Angle, the Olympic Gold Medal Wrestler, makes an appearance as the unbeatable Koba, the Russian  MMA fighter.  His menacing presence lends much excitement to the film.I certainly do not want to give the impression that this film is just about MMA fighting.  There are multiple layers of dramatic themes that are explored in depth.  If this were just a fight film, it would still be quite good, but the added drama drawn from the compelling story is what makes this film one you will remember and ponder.  I guarantee you will recommend this film to friends.I've seen a lot of sports movies in my life, but this is certainly in my top-10.  It is truly a gem of a film. It is most likely considered a ""guy"" film, but I believe the ladies will enjoy it as well.

This is how the story goes: An ex-Marine haunted by a tragic past, Tommy Riordan returns to his hometown of Pittsburgh and enlists his father, a recovered alcoholic and his former coach, to train him for a mixed martial arts tournament awarding the biggest purse in the history of the sport. As Tommy blazes a violent path towards the title prize, his brother, Brendan, a former MMA fighter unable to make ends meet as a public school teacher, returns to the amateur ring to provide for his family. Even though years have passed, recriminations and past betrayals keep Brendan bitterly estranged from both Tommy and his father. But when Brendan's unlikely rise as an underdog sets him on a collision course with Tommy, the two brothers must finally confront the forces that tore them apart, all the while waging the most intense, winner-takes-all battle of their lives.The cast led by Tom Hardy (as Tommy), Joel Edgerton (as Brendan) & Nick Nolte (in a terrific Oscar-worthy performance as Paddy Conlon) is great.

Only if I go searching for them online. I'm not usually into movies like this...referring to the type of violence. I don't like boxing. I mean, I can watch movie fighting, I'm not that sensitive, it's just not what I prefer. So, you might be wondering why I even watched it in the first place. Well...I have to be honest. It was because of Tom Hardy. I just think he's an amazing actor. He's like Daniel Day-Lewis plus Robert DeNiro and maybe even a dash of Lawrence Olivier thrown in for good measure.I watched Bronson a couple of years ago, and I thought if I can sit through that for Tom Hardy, surely I can watch this movie. If you haven't seen Bronson, you won't know what I'm referring to. Not that it was very much like this movie, just that the character he plays is violent and angry and well, kinda crazy..okay, well, a lot crazy.The character he plays in this movie isn't exactly crazy, but he is angry. I don't want to give anything specific away about the movie, but I'll just say his character has issues.Well, I'm glad I gave it a chance, because I ended up liking it a lot. Yes, there are fight scenes that made me not want to watch, but I didn't exactly sit here with my eyes covered. The fighting, I thought, was realistic, not over-done or gratuitous. I found myself wanting certain things to happen, or characters to say what I thought they should say, but it was okay that they didn't. It makes it more real when it's not all tied up with a neat little bow. And that's what makes great story-telling.And it is the story here that hooks you. I didn't even think of not finishing it. The script was excellent, and the acting superb. Nick Nolte's character was painful to watch, but Nick's performance was wonderful. I realized after it was over that Tom Hardy's character didn't really have much dialogue, but you don't notice that as you're watching.

It breaks my heart that it was largely ignored in theaters and has been omitted from a lot of critics' year-end top 10 lists. I add about 5 movies to my DVD collection each year. 'Warrior' is one of those 5 for 2011.Much to my surprise, this movie involving MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fighters is an emotionally riveting character study that retains elements of action and suspense. And the acting is first-rate! Tom Hardy (from Inception) plays Tommy Riordan who deeply internalizes anger and guilt that we catch a glimpse of each time he's in the ring. Joel Edgerton plays high-school Physics teacher Brendan Conlon, Tommy's brother, whose financial struggles send him to a place he had not planned on returning to. And finally, Nick Nolte gives a devastating performance as Tommy's and Brendan's father desperately seeking redemption from both of his sons. To say more would ruin it.

Here is courage, mankind's finest possession, here is the noblest prize that a young man can endeavour to win."" - Spartan poem.Wow.Powerful, powerful, powerful film.Tells the story of three members of a completely dysfunctional family. A reformed drunk and his two sons; both of whom detest their old man.The younger brother is Tommy, brilliantly played by Tom Hardy, a former all-state wrestling champion who fled with his mother just as he was being prepped for the Olympic Games. His older brother is Brendan, played by Joel Edgerton in a breakout performance.Brendan, like his younger brother, had dreams of becoming a champion but couldn't get his father to take more than a passing interest in him, even when his 'favorite' son disappeared with his mother - there was nothing left for him. With his brother and his mother gone, the old man just sank into a dark abyss filled with booze.Gratefully, the film doesn't get drawn into a pedestrian tale about physical abuse and alcoholism, but frames it without distortion so one can understand the pure anger the two feel toward their father. And because of one fateful decision that split the brothers apart, deep anger and boiling resentment against each other as well.Tommy was left in a vacuum where he learned to hate. Brendan stayed, went to college and found a new life as a school teacher.Fate intervenes and brings all three back together, but not in a happy kumbayah sugar circle. No, they collide at a fictional MMA tournament called 'Sparta', named after the ancient city-state which produced, what is considered by many, some of the finest warriors to have ever walked the planet, past or present. The reward for winning: $5 million dollars. For those that fall to the wayside - nothing.Each brother driven by completely differing purposes; each one determined to win at all cost. It's a stunningly savage and brutal confluence - a true civil war fought on multiple fronts.The acting was superb. The characters fully and completely developed. No weakness in either the script, cinematography, pacing, or directorship. A genuinely amazing, incredible and awe-inspriring film.Man, this was one bleeping powerful bleeping movie. I thought 'Redbelt' was fantastic. I see now, in comparison, it's merely very good. Honestly don't have the ability to describe this with mere words.Just watch it.Watch it for the characters, watch it for the drama, watch it because deep down we all want to feel this connected to the core essence of what it means to be a man - to fight with your heart and forgive with the same.Personal Note: I've made mention before about the 'lost'Nick Nolte. If this doesn't prove he's still got it - then nothing will. My gut twisted watching Nolte's character grovel.

1325432,A2GL71JNGTB5TU,B0034G4P94,"Margo ""classics lover""","[184, 192]","Except for the lack of a SPOILER note at the beginning of the first reviewer, I think these first two reviews pretty much cover the story and hit some high points of the film. I do want to disagree with some of the remarks, though.First, I would not call this a sports movie. It is not Rocky, Raging Bull, The Wrestler, or The Fighter. Warrior, according to many professional critics, is better than all of them, and I agree. There is the suspense factor of who will win the championship fight, for sure, and the stand-up-and-cheer factor as the opponents are picked off one by one, and there is the heartwarming factor as the school teacher tries to save his home from foreclosure. These cliches somehow are not relevant to this film and I salute O'Connor and the other writers for telling a story that glosses over them.As some reviewers have pointed out, this film is not really about MMA (mixed martial arts) winners and losers. Like others, I had never heard of MMA and don't like either boxing or wrestling (for me the former is just brutal beating and the second relies on a series of moves that I don't understand). But in this film MMA is choreographed so that you see the intensity and bruises on the fighters faces, the strain and pain on their arms, legs, and shoulders, but are not cringing at any blood and gore. There is no blood and gore in the cage (and probably that is what accounts for its PG-13 rating). As for the cinematography, the periodically trembling camera follows the fighters in close-ups, so you actually feel like you are standing in the ref's shoes. The score, which includes Ode to Joy and The National's About Today, is perfect.I think what really puts the gold on the five stars, though, is the caliber of acting. When the movie was made,over two years ago, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton were barely known to American audiences. O'Connor said he didn't want the performers to overshadow the characters, and with the anonymity of the actors, he would achieve that. He shouldn't have worried. The brothers, especially Hardy, completely disappear in the characters. Nolte not so much. His real life and his persona as Paddy Conlon are not so far apart, but I can't think of any other actor who could redeem this character with such pathos.As story-telling goes, Warrior is both a movie and a film. Nobody doesn't love Warrior. Teens will love it, the parent-sibling-sibling conflicts relatable. And the cage fighting will thrill them. In fact, the whole family will enjoy this, sitting on the edge of the seats, cheering, and tearing up sometimes simultaneously. By the way, it wasn't only the ladies tearing up a time or two. After the screening I attended, no one, man or woman, moved from their seats, the lights remained down, only some muted sniffling and discreet blowing of noses.For the arthouse crowd, there is profound metaphor embedded in the film. There are actually three warriors (fighters) in Warrior, and not one of them actually wins the war (the big fight). The brothers have not seen each other in 14 years, each of them feeling betrayed by the other at a crucial point in the life of the family. The one thing they have in common is hatred for their father, a former drunk and wife-beater. Brendan, the older son, has moved his own family as far away from Paddy as possible and still be in the same state. Communication must be had only by phone or mail. Tommy, an ex-Marine, shows up at his father's house, again after 14 years --but with zero communication-- and wants Paddy to train him for a big tournament. Why in the world, some would say, does Tommy go to his father for this. He hates him. Well, Paddy, also an ex-Marine and pro boxer, trained both Tommy and Brendan as boys. Tommy in wrestling, Brenden in boxing. But Tommy was a champion. Parallels permitted to be drawn. And so, because his motivation is so strong (and so poignant as we find out later), Tommy wants to be trained by the man who made him champion. Paddy hopes to revive this relationship, but Tommy is having none of it. Hardy absolutely seethes in his scenes with Nolte; every comment is a stab wound, every look a gunshot. Nolte takes it like a dog after he's been kicked. Coming back for the pat on the head. Scenes between these two are Oscar material, hands down.As the story develops, slowly, but with tantalizing bits of mystery in the plot, a lot of gaps are filled in. At the point where the two finalists, Tommy Riordan and Brendan Conlon (""They are brothers!"" the announcer shouts), enter the cage, we are so conflicted we want to cry (and we do). Then the script throws us a screwball(another shock, another jerk of a tear). Who the hell to cheer for?! There are no bad guys to fight! Just two alienated brothers who need to beat the crap out of each other in order to win the prize they need so desperately. And when the fight is over, it isn't really over. The end of the cage fight is gut-wrenching. No one wins. Not Tommy, not Brendan, not Paddy. A lot of people say the ""ending"" of the movie is predictable. Which ending is that? The knockout? The takedown? The tapout? And what exactly do each of those signify? Is there redemption for Paddy? Are there resolutions to the conflicts among the father and brothers?  What happens to Tommy, to Brendan, to Paddy, after the tournament ends?Warrior will run your emotions ragged. High, low, and very few in-betweens. I think the movie will make the Best Films list, and it better get its nominations for Hardy and Nolte. I think Edgerton's quietly powerful performance is award worthy, too, but not in contention with the other two.  I hope audiences don't pass this film by because they think it's a violent fight movie or, for UFC fans, too tame. This is a jewel that should be treasured by everyone.",5,This War Is Not in an MMA Cage,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,5794,"['lack', 'SPOILER', 'note', 'beginning', 'first', 'reviewer', 'think',

If, like me, half of it was illegible, you'll miss a lot of the things that make the plot work and hint that characters have made progress. The performances are spectacular to a man so the acting strength made me rewatch it and this time I turned on the subtitles and caught a lot more. Just a suggestion: it's definitely underwritten, and the characters stay somewhat stock but the acting blows it all away anyway. Karate Kid for adults, with a serious family drama interwoven. Somehow this odd chemistry works.One more thing that really bothers me about nearly every review and plot description I've seen. This is NOT the Tom Hardy Show. Yes, he's brilliant. But it's Joel Edgerton's movie. His character is the lead, the main focus and the only sympathetic person in the thing. His story is the main storyline and the tale that holds the entire show together so don't go in thinking it's all about Hardy. It's not. Edgerton's Brandon is the focus and the follow-through and the heart. Hardy is the broken-to-the-point-of-psychotic mess he plays so well.Speaking of which, I wish someone would let him play something without blood on his teeth....Update: just have to add that this has turned out to be my favorite film of that year.

1325442,A2ZFN595FLTHEB,B0034G4P94,Michael Martinez,"[8, 32]","I went to see Warrior on my birthday last week because 1) I heard this was basically ""The Fighter with kicking"" and I enjoyed The Fighter a lot and 2) I wanted to see how Tom Hardy would pull off a physically imposing role with him playing Bane in next year's The Dark Knight Rises (as if you didn't know already). This film was also receiving good reviews and I'm always looking for a good story.The good news is that I think Tom Hardy will have no trouble convincing anyone he can go toe to toe with Batman next year, as his character in this movie was just destroying guys convincingly.Perhaps the not so good news is that, after having several days to digest the movie, I'm not sure it was all that good. There are similarities between Warrior and The Fighter, with the sports aspect and focus on the family dynamic, specifically between two brothers. Most of the time it's fairly easy to make and enjoy a sports movie because they tend to include an underdog and a relatively one dimensional demonized antagonist. What makes Warrior a bit different is that it's a story that belongs to both of the brothers, and they both have very good reasons for entering a $5 million mixed martial arts tournament. Some of those who came to see the movie with me even turned to me during the film and remarked how they weren't sure which one they should root for.I can see how this kind of ambiguity can be appealing and even enough to convince folks that this is perhaps twice as good as the standard sports movies because you can root for either one of these brothers, but the more I think about it, the more it feels like they wanted to make a movie about one brother and one about the other and in the end each was given half a story and half a movie. This was particularly true of Tom Hardy's character, Tommy, who plays a very rough around the edges ex soldier with a dark past. We're introduced to Tommy first as he confronts his father, Paddy (played by Nick Nolte), after a decade-and-a-half estrangement that began when Tommy and his mother fled from his abusive father. Tommy's older brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton), stayed with Paddy to pursue his high school sweetheart. To Tommy's surprise, Paddy has been sober for years now, as Tommy has obviously taken to drinking to drown out his ghosts, including the memory of his mother, who became ill and died after they fled. Tommy uses virtually every opportunity to throw his father's past nature in his face; it's clear Tommy despises his father, yet returns several days later to ask his father to train him for an upcoming MMA tournament due to Paddy's great success as Tommy's childhood wrestling trainer.With all of this potential for drama, it may be puzzling to note the assessment of Tommy only having half a story. However, the reason I think the movie fell short of exploring the dramatic potential was because Tommy is constantly acting like a douche bag, and all of his redemptive qualities seem to be buried in his past along with his demons. There are adequate opportunities to explore the strenuous bonds between his father and him and between him and Brenden, but the movie has Tommy slamming the door on these chances time and time again. Of course, there is understandable resentment and anger Tommy bears towards both of them, so it makes sense that he doesn't break down and try to begin anew with either them right away. But, this isn't the problem; the problem is that there is a distinct lack of exploration of these issues brought on by the writers keeping him in the same gear throughout the movie. It felt as if there needed to be another character in this movie that Tommy could express himself to so we could get a better look inside his head, because when the redemptive moments do come, they seem almost forced, and when the reconciliation moments come, they certainly seem too quick.Brenden, on the other hand, has his motivations laid out for us. It's revealed he used to fight in MMA matches but has since given that life up at the behest of Tess, his then-sweetheart and now-wife. Brenden is now a high school physics teacher and raises two kids with Tess, and their family maintains a wide emotional and physical distance from Paddy. Tess and Brenden have three jobs between them, but still struggle to make ends meet. A major blow comes to the family when Brenden is informed that he doesn't have the money needed to keep their house, which will be repossessed in a matter of weeks. Desperate, Brenden enters a minor cash prize MMA fight and wins, but the telltale signs of fighting put a strain on his marriage and cause him to get suspended without pay at the high school. Low on options, he convinces his wife to let him start fighting again in order to keep the house, and he enlists the help of his friend and old trainer, who also happens to be training another participant for the major MMA tournament in which Tommy will participate. During the obligatory montage of training and minor fights, this other fighter is injured and Brenden convinces his friend to let him take the fighter's place in the tournament.The stage is set and the brothers collide as revealed by the trailers and the cage is where the brothers have most of their interaction. Throughout the tournament, Tommy proceeds to dominate and Brenden maintains an underdog  status. Brenden's motivations are clear throughout, but Tommy remains a mystery to the film's audience and fans of the tournament until bits and pieces of his past come out. The revelations of Tommy's doing what he does and being who he is are painted in about the most undeniably selfless way possible, which is in stark contrast to the belligerent jerk he is to everyone, so it's hard not to feel the filmmakers poking you with a stick and demanding you like him.I have no doubts, though, that some will look at what Tommy's done and been through and find him easily justified and likeable, but this wasn't my only gripe with the film, despite being the major one. It was unavoidable to compare this movie to The Fighter, and this comparison doesn't help Warrior very much. First off, the acting was far superior in The Fighter, from Christian Bale's chameleon-like portrayal to Amy Adam's edge providing a pleasant departure from her wholesome roles. You can say that Tom Hardy effectively pulls off his character's angry and aloof nature, but the character provides so little room for Tommy and Paddy's words and emotions to carry a dynamic with, leaving no real stellar performances. Secondly, there was a distinct lack of pure entertainment moments that are associated with sports films, the ones where the underdog or the trainer pulls off a pitch-perfect one-liner or completes a move that's smart, sneaky, yet still within the boundaries of the rules; this was particularly evident in the dialogue, which wound up largely forgettable.Despite the filmmakers wanting to achieve (by any means necessary) a double helping of heroes to root for, I felt that both characters of Tommy and Brenden were shafted in some aspect, with the writers keeping Tommy in neutral through too much of the film and the director demanding very little from Edgerton's Brenden. Still, Brenden comes out more likeable and relatable. The movie was good enough, but I felt it could have been better had the dialogue distilled the character's emotions and motivations more clearly and punctuated the scenes. It should get some credit from deviating from standard sports movie fare, but not to the point where we overlook its flaws and overrate it.I'd give it a 3-3.5/5 stars, largely because I am a sucker for sports movies.",3,Not Without Its Flaws [SPOILERS],1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,7639,"['went', 'see', 'Warrior', 'birthday', 'last', 'week', '1', 'heard', 'was', 'basically', 'Fighter',

1325446,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0034G4P94,M. Oleson,"[3, 6]","I remember watching the trailers for this movie several months ago and not being terribly excited about another ""fighter"" movie.  Especially so close to ""The Fighter"" late last year.  Add in a couple foreign actors I didn't know much about and a washed up Nick Nolte and really, do I want to see this?  And then this really isn't boxing, this is mixed martial arts.  The art being where 2 guys try to beat each other to death using any means necessary outside using a weapon.  Hell, they even use a cage.  But then I remember ""The Wrestler"" from 2008 which was a very good movie, so what the hell.  I liked this movie from the opening bell as it were.  We see WARRIOR spelled out in screen-filling dimensions, followed by no credits.The film has 2 characters on a literal collision course to a potential $5 million payday.  One is a former MMA fighter who was described by one analyst as being ""memorable for being unmemorable.""  He's currently a physics teacher at a suburban Philadelphia high school but is on the verge of losing his house to foreclosure.  The other character is his estranged younger brother Tommy played by ""Inception's"" Tom Hardy.  He has just returned from the Marines having served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He returns to Pittsburgh where his father (Nick Nolte) is a reformed alcoholic.  He obviously never received any father-of-the-year awards driving Tommy and his mother away to Oregon years earlier.Tommy wants his father to train him for the tournament like he did when Tommy was a stellar high school wrestler.  As bitter as Tommy is about his dad, he's even more so about his brother who stayed behind. He was just 16 and was in love with the girl he would eventually marry (Jennifer Morrison).  We know how the tournament will evolve, having seen everything already in the many trailers.  Brendan (Joel Edgerton) will fight his brother in the finals.  Nobody knows they are brothers because Tommy adopted his mother's maiden name.  Now, ""Warrior"" breaks no new ground.  It has all the fighter clich&eacute;s, going back to ""The Set-Up"" from 1949 to ""Killer's Kiss"" (1955) to 1976's Rocky to ""The Fighter.""  It's the underdog or in this case underdogs struggling to overcome their weaknesses.  It is a common theme.  That and many other clich&eacute;s are not dodged by director Gavin O'Connor.  In fact they are embraced.What makes this movie different and yes, better are the actual words coming out of the actor's mouths and the actors who deliver them.  Tom Hardy gives a performance that you can't forget.  And Nick Nolte?  Who knew he had it in him?  Put him on a short list for Oscar consideration.  I found myself getting involved and ultimately committed to this story and its characters.  The fight scenes are very realistic although I admit I couldn't figure out some of those submission holds.  Watch the movie for the emotional conflict, the personal drama and the fine acting.  The fight action is just a bonus.",4,"4 1/2 stars for what should be a ""contender"" come award season",1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,2958,"['remember', 'watching', 'trailers', 'movie', 'several', 'months', 'ago', 'not', 'being', 'terribly', 'excited', 'fighter', 'movie', 'Especially', 'so', 'close', 'Fighter', 'late', 'last', 'year', 'Add', 'couple', 'foreign', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'washed', 'up', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'really', 'do', 'want', 'see', 'then', 'really', ""n't"", 'boxing', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'art', 'being', 'where', '2', 'guys', 'try', 'beat', 'other', 'death', 'using', 'means', 'necessary', 'using', 'weapon', 'Hell', 'even', 'use', 'cage', 'then', 'remember', 'Wrestler', '2008', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'what', 'hell', 'liked', 'movie', 'opening', 'bell', 'were', 'see', 'WARRIOR', 'spelled', 'out', 'screen-filling', 'dimensions', 'followed', 'credits.The', 'film', '2', 'characters', 'literal', 'collision', 'course', 'potential', '5', 'million', 'payday', 'One', 'former', 'MMA', 'fighter', 'who', 'was', 'described', 'one', 'analyst', 'being', 'memorable', 'being', 'unmemorable', 'currently', 'physics', 'teacher', 'suburban', 'Philadelphia', 'high', 'school', 'verge', 'losing', 'house', 'foreclosure', 'other', 'character', 'estranged', 'younger', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'played', 'Inception', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'just', 'returned', 'Marines', 'having', 'served', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Pittsburgh', 'where', 'father', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'reformed', 'alcoholic', 'obviously', 'never', 'received', 'father-of-the-year', 'awards', 'driving', 'Tommy', 'mother', 'away', 'Oregon', 'years', 'earlier.Tommy', 'father', 'train', 'tournament', 'did', 'when', 'Tommy', 'was', 'stellar', 'high', 'school', 'wrestler', 'As', 'bitter', 'Tommy', 'dad', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'brother', 'who', 'stayed', 'behind', 'was', 'just', '16', 'was', 'love', 'girl', 'would', 'eventually', 'marry', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'know', 'how', 'tournament', 'will', 'evolve', 'having', 'seen', 'everything', 'already', 'many', 'trailers', 'Brendan', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'will', 'fight', 'brother', 'finals', 'Nobody', 'are', 'brothers', 'Tommy', 'adopted', 'mother', 'maiden', 'name', 'Now', 'Warrior', 'new', 'ground', 'fighter', 'clich', 'eacute', 'going', 'back', 'Set-Up', '1949', 'Killer', 'Kiss', '1955', '1976', 'Rocky', 'Fighter', 'underdog', 'case', 'underdogs', 'struggling', 'overcome', 'weaknesses', 'common', 'theme', 'many', 'other', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'are', 'not', 'dodged', 'director', 'Gavin', ""O'Connor"", 'fact', 'are', 'movie', 'different', 'yes', 'better', 'are', 'actual', 'words', 'coming', 'actor', 'mouths', 'actors', 'who', 'deliver', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Who', 'knew', 'had', 'Put', 'short', 'list', 'Oscar', 'consideration', 'found', 'getting', 'involved', 'ultimately', 'committed', 'story', 'characters', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'admit', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'submission', 'Watch', 'movie', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'personal', 'drama', 'fine', 'acting', 'fight', 'action', 'just', 'bonus']",N/A

1325456,AXYJ9QJYS3S78,B0034G4P94,pastapadre,"[9, 14]","Despite MMA's rising prominence it has generally been treated as an ""underground"" sport in films. That changes with Warrior, a movie that takes the familiar inspirational sports story with family conflict and intertwines that with an MMA tournament that carries large significance for the main characters. The fight action is authentic - though obviously some moments and results were played up for dramatic purposes - and in doing so it presents the sport in a legitimate fashion and one that translates well to the big screen.The story focuses on two brothers - one a Marine recently returned to the US (Tom Hardy) and the other a High School physics teacher (Joel Edgerton) - who for their own reasons return to MMA training and eventually find themselves entered in a high profile winner take all tournament pitting 16 of the best middleweights in the world. A family split years ago has left them at odds with each other as well as their father (Nick Nolte).It's somewhat unfortunate that the culmination with the two brothers facing each other in the finals was used to market the film, as that takes away some of the suspense, but most would have assumed it would reach that point anyway. Still it's the emotional journey that will click with audiences rather than discovery of the end result and in that regard it is successful.There will be a few elements that need some suspension of disbelief. The viability of a 16 man tournament over two nights in a world dominated by UFC, the contrivances in how these two relative unknowns make the tournament to begin with, and one of them remaining a crowd favorite despite a late revelation are just a couple of them. The fight announcers are also annoying in how they constantly disparage the two. We get it. They're underdogs.Despite all those things Warrior is quite powerful in its depiction of the family's struggle to reconcile and the circumstances of each individual character. The performances are excellent - don't be surprised to see a few names like Nolte getting nominated this award season. The decision made by the brothers has sent them down completely different paths and that is well portrayed. Kurt Angle even makes an appearance as an imposing Russian presence (seemed to be a take on Fedor Emelianenko) and he pulls off the role quite well despite not having a single word of dialogue.Though it leaves some story threads unresolved Warrior is a satisfying film that is deserving of the accolades it has received. While I didn't find it to be ""Best Picture"" worthy I would put it on the same level as last year's The Fighter. The strong performances outweigh the story and the MMA action is refreshing given that boxing-themed films have been the staple of the inspirational sports stories for so long.",3,Strong performances and respectful of MMA,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,2774,"['MMA', 'rising', 'prominence', 'generally', 'been', 'treated', 'underground', 'sport', 'films', 'Warrior', 'movie', 'familiar', 'inspirational', 'sports', 'story', 'family', 'conflict', 'intertwines', 'MMA', 'tournament', 'large', 'significance', 'main', 'characters', 'fight', 'action', 'authentic', 'obviously', 'moments', 'results', 'were', 'played', 'up', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'doing', 'sport', 'legitimate', 'fashion', 'one', 'well', 'big', 'screen.The', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'one', 'Marine', 'recently', 'returned', 'US', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'other', 'High', 'School', 'physics', 'teacher', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'who', 'own', 'reasons', 'return', 'MMA', 'training', 'eventually', 'find', 'entered', 'high', 'profile', 'winner', 'take', 'tournament', 'pitting', '16', 'best', 'middleweights', 'world', 'family', 'split', 'years', 'ago', 'left', 'odds', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'father', 'Nick', 'Nolte', '.It', 'somewhat', 'unfortunate', 'culmination', 'two', 'brothers', 'facing', 'other', 'finals', 'was', 'used', 'market', 'film', 'away', 'suspense', 'most', 'would', 'have', 'assumed', 'would', 'reach', 'point', 'anyway', 'Still', 'emotional', 'journey', 'will', 'click', 'audiences', 'rather', 'discovery', 'end', 'result', 'regard', 'successful.There', 'will', 'be', 'few', 'elements', 'need', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'viability', '16', 'man', 'tournament', 'two', 'nights', 'world', 'dominated', 'UFC', 'contrivances', 'how', 'two', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'make', 'tournament', 'begin', 'one', 'remaining', 'crowd', 'favorite', 'late', 'revelation', 'are', 'just', 'couple', 'fight', 'announcers', 'are', 'also', 'annoying', 'how', 'constantly', 'disparage', 'two', 'get', ""'re"", 'underdogs.Despite', 'things', 'Warrior', 'quite', 'powerful', 'depiction', 'family', 'struggle', 'reconcile', 'circumstances', 'individual', 'character', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'few', 'names', 'Nolte', 'getting', 'nominated', 'award', 'season', 'decision', 'made', 'brothers', 'sent', 'down', 'completely', 'different', 'paths', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Kurt', 'Angle', 'even', 'appearance', 'imposing', 'Russian', 'presence', 'seemed', 'be', 'take', 'Fedor', 'Emelianenko', 'role', 'quite', 'well', 'not', 'having', 'single', 'word', 'dialogue.Though', 'story', 'threads', 'unresolved', 'Warrior', 'satisfying', 'film', 'deserving', 'accolades', 'received', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'Best', 'Picture', 'worthy', 'would', 'put', 'same', 'level', 'last', 'year', 'Fighter', 'strong', 'performances', 'outweigh', 'story', 'MMA', 'action', 'refreshing', 'given', 'boxing-themed', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'staple', 'inspirational', 'sports', 'stories', 'so', 'long']",N/A

Warrior is perfectly cast and perfectly acted with a beautifully told story that plays out with spot on perfect pacing.  ""Warrior"" is quite possibly a ""PERFECT"" movie in all respects if that sort of thing even exists in Hollywood any more.  It tells a compelling story that you're immediately drawn into with enough back story on the characters for you to completely invest in them.  Take Tom Hardy's character for instance.  The guy comes off as totally abrasive and really unlikable-yet at the same time, you understand completely why he is the way he is and you don't fault him for it.  You understand him.  Nick Nolte's character on the other hand-knowing his past and what a horrible man he must have been makes him sort of despicable.  Yet one cannot help but feel sympathy for him in his tough journey to become a better man even though his son's have written him off and will forever see their father as a monster without possible redemption.  Joel Edgerton's character (my favorite of the trio) has his own problems to deal with and though he is the most grounded, also suffers from a deep mistrust of his father and an estrangement from his brother.""Warrior"" is just an all out excellent film that gives you something to believe in, something to cheer for and will absolutely make you feel something.  I challenge any man alive to watch this film and not get choked up at one scene or another.  It strikes a man on so many levels in a way that's honest and heart felt.  Last year, the film ""The Fighter"" garnered so much oscar love and attention.  ""Warrior"" blows ""The Fighter"" away in every category in my opinion.  It's just an outstanding movie all the way through and for two solid hours just takes you into the lives of these three men you can totally relate to and root for.  Don't miss this one.  This movie is absolutely outstanding.  This should have hands down won the Oscar for best picture this year (criminally it wasn't even nominated).  At least Nick Nolte earned a nomination though for best supporting actor though and rightfully so.

The beginning, the first 1/3, was slow in parts, bad pacing and development of the story.Now, the things I did like. I fracking loved the gritty feel, the camera work, the directing. I loved that they didn't have a bunch of ""big names"" (I mean who wants to deal with having to sort Skittles and ""back end"" promises). I loved the actors, they did a great job.

The story is about two estranged brothers one in the military that went AWOL returning to his hometown and the other one a physics teacher trying to meet ends meet with a family whose house is about to be foreclosed. Both brothers are very different in both goals and emotions, Tommy (played by Tom Hardy) an aggressive man who is quiet to himself and only speaks when furious. Brendan (played by Joel Edgerton) is a family man trying his best to support his family and pay off his home before the bank takes it away. Both brothers, while different, have a common relationship with their father (played by Nick Nolte) who was a former military man and alcoholic and neither brother wants anything to do with him. The whole story is composed around MMA (Mixed Martial Arts), which is the only way both brothers can understand and find answers in.While the movie has very well choreagraphed fighting and a good introduction to the sport of MMA, the fighting in the movie is only but a subsidiary to the films main central theme. The movie is primarily about family and unconditional love for your family. Tommy and Brendan have a complex relationship, Tommy's beef toward Brendan is solely based on him eloping with his wife and leaving the family behind and most importantly leaving the mother who died without her other son around. The departure of his older brother and father made Tommy the bitter man he is while it is hard to feel his pain, he shows his warm human side when he talks to a close friend on the phone later in the movie. Brendan is a more straightforward character who lays out his goal out on the floor: win the MMA tournament, get the money, live a happy life; in contrast to Tommy whose goal is unknown until about halfway through the movie. There are key scenes in the film where the viewers can get a full perspective of the relationships between the chracters, and these intimate moments whether it be Brendan and the dad, Tommy and the dad, or Brendan and Tommy, it's those scenes between the family that carries the film to making it the near classic it is.When watching the film you realize that rarely do films nowadays really contain complicated family relationships such as these, sure Warrior has it's cliches, but it really is an uplifting story. From the great fights displayed on screen, to the climactic battle between brothers and the great all around performances especially Nick Nolte for his portrayal of the trying-immense father, this is easily one of the best movies of 2011 and now officially my favorite MMA movie =)",5,"Uplifting, Heart Warming and Human",1324857600,"12 26, 2011",2011,2644,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', '2011', 'movies', 'have', 'impacted', 'as', 'much', 'Warrior', 'story', 'two', 'estranged', 'brothers', 'one', 'military', 'went', 'AWOL', 'returning', 'hometown', 'other', 'one', 'physics', 'teacher', 'trying', 'meet', 'ends', 'meet', 'family', 'house', 'be', 'foreclosed', 'brothers', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'goals', 'emotions', 'Tommy', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'aggressive', 'man', 'who', 'quiet', 'only', 'when', 'furious', 'Brendan', 'played', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'family', 'man', 'trying', 'best', 'support', 'family', 'pay', 'off', 'home', 'bank', 'away', 'brothers', 'different', 'have', 'common', 'relationship', 'father', 'played', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'who', 'was', 'former', 'military', 'man', 'alcoholic', 'brother', 'anything', 'do', 'whole', 'story', 'composed', 'MMA', 'Mixed', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'only', 'way', 'brothers', 'can', 'understand', 'find', 'answers', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'choreagraphed', 'fighting', 'good', 'introduction', 'sport', 'MMA', 'fighting', 'movie', 'only', 'subsidiary', 'films', 'main', 'central', 'theme', 'movie', 'primarily', 'family', 'unconditional', 'love', 'family', 'Tommy', 'Brendan', 'have', 'complex', 'relationship', 'Tommy', 'beef', 'Brendan', 'solely', 'based', 'eloping', 'wife', 'leaving', 'family', 'most', 'importantly', 'leaving', 'mother', 'who', 'died', 'other', 'son', 'departure', 'older', 'brother', 'father', 'made', 'Tommy', 'bitter', 'man', 'hard', 'feel', 'pain', 'warm', 'human', 'side', 'when', 'close', 'friend', 'phone', 'later', 'movie', 'Brendan', 'more', 'straightforward', 'character', 'who', 'out', 'goal', 'out', 'floor', 'win', 'MMA', 'tournament', 'get', 'money', 'live', 'happy', 'life', 'contrast', 'Tommy', 'goal', 'unknown', 'halfway', 'movie', 'are', 'key', 'scenes', 'film', 'where', 'viewers', 'can', 'get', 'full', 'perspective', 'relationships', 'chracters', 'intimate', 'moments', 'be', 'Brendan', 'dad', 'Tommy', 'dad', 'Brendan', 'Tommy', 'scenes', 'family', 'film', 'making', 'near', 'classic', 'watching', 'film', 'realize', 'rarely', 'do', 'films', 'nowadays', 'really', 'contain', 'complicated', 'family', 'relationships', 'such', 'sure', 'Warrior', 'cliches', 'really', 'uplifting', 'story', 'great', 'fights', 'displayed', 'screen', 'climactic', 'battle', 'brothers', 'great', 'performances', 'especially', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'portrayal', 'trying-immense', 'father', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2011', 'now', 'officially', 'favorite', 'MMA', 'movie', '=']",N/A

1325467,A1L6V03YBQ8UK0,B0034G4P94,"Richard Allen ""R. Allen""","[1, 1]","I cannot say enough good things about this film. I admit it was Jennifer Morrison that drew me to the movie, but it was the cast and the terrific story that kept me interested. Tom Hardy is very good in the role of the bitter brother and you can tell he really beefed up for the role (he wasn't nearly as big back when he was in Star Trek: Nemesis). Joel Edgerton looks to have moved on his from his Star Wars days and is making a name for himself. He plays the never say die father of two who not only pushes himself to the limit in the ring, but also tries his damnedest to mend old wound between he and his brother.Nick Nolte plays a sobered up father to both Hardy and Edgerton and gives arguably the best performance of his career. Not to be undone, Jennifer Morrison also gives a solid effort and is a standout in a film that has testosterone flowing through it.The MMA fight scenes are well choreographed and gritty. They feel very real and you can tell they brought in some people from the world of MMA to make sure they did those scenes justice.Overall, the film is a great piece of work and I have to say it's a pity that it didn't do better at the box office.With all that being said, I have to admit I am a little disappointed in the blu ray transfer. I understand a film like this is going to have a little grit in the film and be a little grainy. The problem is, at times, there is so much grain that it detracts from the film's efforts. I expect some grain during night scenes, but in some of them there was so much of it that it was hard to make out certain objects. Even during the daytime scenes where grain usually isn't a problem turned out etched and often felt like there wasn't a huge amount of effort into transitioning this brilliant movie into a format that would do it justice. The sound was alright, but there were a few scenes where I had to adjust the volume to hear all the dialog.For the film - 4.1 / 5For the BR xfer - 2.2 / 5",4,An Amazing Achievement for All the Players,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,1959,"['can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'admit', 'was', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'drew', 'movie', 'was', 'cast', 'terrific', 'story', 'kept', 'interested', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'bitter', 'brother', 'can', 'tell', 'really', 'beefed', 'up', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'big', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Nemesis', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'have', 'moved', 'Star', 'Wars', 'days', 'making', 'name', 'never', 'say', 'die', 'father', 'two', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'limit', 'ring', 'also', 'damnedest', 'mend', 'old', 'wound', 'brother.Nick', 'Nolte', 'sobered', 'up', 'father', 'Hardy', 'Edgerton', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'Not', 'be', 'undone', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'also', 'solid', 'effort', 'standout', 'film', 'testosterone', 'flowing', 'it.The', 'MMA', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'choreographed', 'gritty', 'feel', 'very', 'real', 'can', 'tell', 'brought', 'people', 'world', 'MMA', 'make', 'sure', 'did', 'scenes', 'justice.Overall', 'film', 'great', 'piece', 'work', 'have', 'say', 'pity', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'box', 'being', 'said', 'have', 'admit', 'am', 'little', 'disappointed', 'blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'understand', 'film', 'going', 'have', 'little', 'grit', 'film', 'be', 'little', 'grainy', 'problem', 'times', 'so', 'much', 'grain', 'film', 'efforts', 'expect', 'grain', 'night', 'scenes', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'hard', 'make', 'out', 'certain', 'objects', 'Even', 'daytime', 'scenes', 'where', 'grain', 'usually', ""n't"", 'problem', 'turned', 'out', 'etched', 'often', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'amount', 'effort', 'transitioning', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'format', 'would', 'do', 'justice', 'sound', 'was', 'alright', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'had', 'adjust', 'volume', 'hear', 'dialog.For', 'film', '4.1', '5For', 'BR', 'xfer', '2.2', '/', '5']",N/A
1325468,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0034G4P94,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Warrior (Gavin O'Connor, 2011)That the ending of Warrior is predictable from the moment the two sequences that set up our two main characters have finished is entirely irrelevant to one's enjoyment of this sublime piece of cinema, or at least it should be. Warrior is a simple story, simply told, that is carried on the backs of those two lead characters, and the acting ability of the actors who play them. There are many other things to enjoy about this movie indeed (even if you're not an MMA fan, or even a sports fan in general, and I am living testament to this), but the centerpiece is the perfect performances by Joel Edgerton (The Thing) and Tom Hardy (Inception). Neither of them has carried a major role before; both are usually found in minor supporting roles. I predict that, after Warrior, that will change rapidly.Edgerton and Hardy play brothers, Brendan Conlan and Tommy Riordan respectively. Both used to be MMA fighters. Brendan, after an ultimatum from his wife following a near-death experience, hung up the gloves and became a high school physics teacher; Tommy did...something else (the unfolding revelation of Tommy's missing years is a major subplot in the film, so saying what would be a spoiler). Their father Paddy (Affliction's Nick Nolte, and I used that 1998 effort to identify him because that's the last time I liked him in a movie this much) is a trainer and recovering alcoholic who, we get the impression, used to be something of a monster. Now all he wants is to be able to atone for his wrongdoings and make up with his kids. However, as Tommy says at one point in the film, &#8220;the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you.&#8221; All of which is important, but has nothing to do with the main plot of the film: an entrepreneur has set up a winner-take-all MMA tournament with a five million dollar purse. Both brothers are cash-strapped, and both of them decide to go for it, Tommy under his father's tutelage, Brendan back with his old trainer Frank Campana (End of Watch's Frank Grillo).The obvious parallel here, to me, is with Wai Man Yip's ridiculous, but fun, 2003 comedy Anna in Kung Fu Land, which I watched a week or so before this without realizing how parallel the two films are; each is about half setup and then half competition (though Warrior spends much more time on character development even during the competition portion), with the same single-elimination winner-take-all tournament style, even with almost the same number of contestants (Anna's competition has fifteen, Warrior's sixteen), leading to a series of battles that expose the strengths and weaknesses of our main characters. The fight scenes are beautiful, the best I've seen since Girlfight, and with a refreshing lack of the ridiculous tendency in fight scenes these days to have slo-mo blood spray as soon as someone gets tapped with a daisy. But it's all leading exactly where you think it is, so if you dispense with the fighting as a draw here, all you have is these characters and the familial drama that surrounds them. And Gavin O'Connor (Miracle), who also co-wrote with Anthony Tambakis (his writing debut) and Cliff Dorfman (Entourage), knocks it out of the park. The family-drama side of the script is impressionist, light-handed, gives just enough to get you filling in the blanks yourself right up until the end (and gives you enough clues that the unanswered questions at the end are easily answerable with a bit of thinking). It's a very risky proposition, especially in a movie where the other half of the action has all the subtlety and impressionism of a sledgehammer to the face. And they pull it off tremendously. As I've stated a time or two, that is in no small part down to Edgerton and Hardy, who show the world that they are both forces to be reckoned with.

And, what a surprise, he turns out to be a war hero who never took credit for saving someone's life so the whole crowd is cheering for him.  That by itself...yea, okay; but added to all the other unbelievable stuff; no.  If the writers had consulted a group of high school boys, they probably would have recommended that.  Then how the fight turned out in the end: could it have even been attempted to make it more dramatic and moving?  What else could have been thrown in there to aim for a higher crescendo to make it by far the very most dramatic sports movie of all time--since that seems to have been what they were aiming for?  Maybe the other guy's daughter could have been taken hostage and he has to win to save her life, but at the same time Tommy actually had organ damage and would die if he was hit again.  Sound pretty good?  I mean, that would be even more dramatic right, and more dramatic is better.

Instead of high octane explosions and big-budget special effects, this was a movie with well fascinating real-world characters, drama, and some amazing fights.Lonely old Paddy Conlon, (played by hoarse-voiced Nick Nolte of 48 HOURS and CAPE FEAR fame) is a retired mill worker and reformed drunk whose abused wife and angry children have not spoken to him for years.  He finds himself drawn back into family life when his son, Tommy (Played by Tom Hardy--who should become a household name for playing Bane in the upcoming Batman movie), now in the Marine Corps, shows up on his doorstep with a bottle of booze.  Tommy has a chip on his shoulder that could fill the Grand Canyon.  By all appearances, his only reason for visiting his father is to express his hate exercise the hateful demons that vex his every thought.While visiting dear old dad, Tommy becomes a member of the local mixed martial arts gym.  As it turns out, he is a natural-born killer in the ring.Meanwhile, Paddy Conlon's other estranged son, a soft-spoken high school teacher named Brendan (played by Joel Edgerton--Anakin's step-brother in REVENGE OF THE SITH), re-enters mixed martial arts in the hope of stopping the bank from foreclosing on his home.Paddy has dreams of bringing his family back together, but his sons hate him and his wife is dead.  Instead of bringing his adult sons under his wing, he finds himself rebuffed by both of his boys as they  prepare to enter a high-stakes mixed martial arts tournament called ""Spartan.""The twists and turns in this movie are sometimes predictable, but not unwelcomed.  The acting is generally amazing.  Hardy (who is British) and Edgerton (an Australian) are convincing as  martial artists and also as Philadelphians.  Nolte, an old pro, is sympathetic throughout.The fighting scenes are well done but it is the Cinderella story that really pulls you in.",5,The unsung gem of 2011,1322092800,"11 24, 2011",2011,1958,"['summer', 'overcrowded', 'superheroes', 'movies', 'WARRIOR', 'went', 'largely', 'overlooked', 'Instead', 'high', 'octane', 'explosions', 'big-budget', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'movie', 'well', 'fascinating', 'real-world', 'characters', 'drama', 'amazing', 'fights.Lonely', 'old', 'Paddy', 'Conlon', 'played', 'hoarse-voiced', 'Nick', 'Nolte', '48', 'HOURS', 'CAPE', 'FEAR', 'fame', 'retired', 'mill', 'worker', 'reformed', 'drunk', 'abused', 'wife', 'angry', 'children', 'have', 'not', 'spoken', 'years', 'drawn', 'back', 'family', 'life', 'when', 'son', 'Tommy', 'Played', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'who', 'should', 'become', 'household', 'name', 'playing', 'Bane', 'upcoming', 'Batman', 'movie', 'now', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'up', 'doorstep', 'bottle', 'booze', 'Tommy', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'could', 'fill', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'appearances', 'only', 'reason', 'visiting', 'father', 'express', 'hate', 'exercise', 'hateful', 'demons', 'vex', 'thought.While', 'visiting', 'dear', 'old', 'dad', 'Tommy', 'member', 'local', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'gym', 'out', 'natural-born', 'killer', 'ring.Meanwhile', 'Paddy', 'Conlon', 'other', 'estranged', 'son', 'soft-spoken', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'named', 'Brendan', 'played', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'Anakin', 'step-brother', 'REVENGE', 'THE', 'SITH', 're-enters', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'hope', 'stopping', 'bank', 'foreclosing', 'home.Paddy', 'dreams', 'bringing', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'sons', 'hate', 'wife', 'dead', 'Instead', 'bringing', 'adult', 'sons', 'wing', 'rebuffed', 'boys', 'prepare', 'enter', 'high-stakes', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'tournament', 'called', 'Spartan', 'twists', 'movie', 'are', 'sometimes', 'predictable', 'not', 'unwelcomed', 'acting', 'generally', 'amazing', 'Hardy', 'who', 'British', 'Edgerton', 'Australian', 'are', 'convincing', 'martial', 'artists', 'also', 'Philadelphians', 'Nolte', 'old', 'pro', 'sympathetic', 'throughout.The', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'really']",N/A

1325499,A2XT2PHY24FRUP,B0034G4P94,The Epic Show Podcast,"[0, 0]","This is my favorite movie of 2011 and my favorite sports movie of all-time! I saw the trailer to this movie around spring of 2011. My reaction was, 'This is probably gonna suck really bad when it comes out.' The more I watched the trailer, the more I couldn't help but find myself building up my anticipation to see it. I guess the reason why would be because I love movies and I love MMA! We all know most or all recent MMA movies suck and haven't really been taken too seriously due to the previous attempts like 'Never Back Down', 'Fighting'(Not sure if it's even considered an MMA movie, but might as well be.), 'Unrivaled', 'Undisputed' 2 & 3(Great action in these 2 flicks), 'Flashpoint', and 'Redbelt' which was pretty good and realistic but was more of a drama than an MMA or sports movie. Now 'Warrior' has all the elements to make it a great picture. It was one of those rare movies that had you expecting it to be really good even though something inside you said it might suck. Boy was I wrong and glad! Great story, great acting, great action, great music, and an awesome cast. Nick Nolte deserves an Oscar nomination for doing such an awesome job. I am officially a Tom Hardy fan now. Now the most important and favorite part of the movie for me was the conclusion before the credits. I haven't found myself seriously tearing up like that during or right after an action scene since 'T2' or 'Braveheart'. It was such a bittersweet ending when the song 'About Today' starts playing at the end when the brothers are fighting. I'm gonna stop here because I feel myself tearing up just thinking about that final scene in the movie as they're walking back to the locker room and the father is looking at them from a distance. WOW!!! It's almost impossible for me to believe that there will ever be a better MMA movie than 'Warrior'! Great job to director, Gavin O'Connor!

What gives the film its dynamic is not the 'will the underdog rise up and win' trope but will these brothers perhaps literally kill each other whilst they struggle to overcome or rise above their personal and shared demons?  The slaughter of opponents that actor Tom Hardy's (Bain of ""The Dark Knight Rises"") character Tommy Riordan goes through genuinely raises concern for what he's going to do to his estranged brother, Brendan Conlon, also an MMA fighter, when the two finally meet in the cage.  Brendan is certainly the underdog.Pacing the cage throughout the entire film is Nick Nolte's (Paddy Conlon) ravaged patriarch to his sons, metaphorically fighting his past abuses and trying to apologize to his children and re-establish himself in their lives.  This fight, too, is a brutal dance and his sons are accomplished in the art of resistance and creating distance and space while peppering him with one-two emotional shots aimed at reminding him of the bruises and scars he's placed on their souls.  It's a fight that many a child has unfortunately experienced.While you can probably guess what happens by movie's end the fight to get there may leave you hosting a variety of emotions: dread, hope, expectation, anxiousness, disillusionment, and some heartache.  Great performances by all.  I liked this film a lot but I was put off by how they decided to make Brendan's scenes in a dimmed lighting style with a graininess to the film (I wondered at first if there was something wrong, a factory defect, with my Blu-ray disc as this style is only reflected in his scenes if I remember correctly while the other scenes lack that graininess).  4.25 stars.",4,"Warning: Broken, battered, and bruised hearts on display.",1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,2013,"['More', 'broken', 'family', 'dynamics', 'how', 'sons', 'brothers', 'cope', 'abusive', 'hands', 'alcoholic', 'parent', 'father', 'can', 'lead', 'quietly', 'hopeful', 'still', 'shattered', 'lives', 'need/', 'drive', 'continue', 'fight', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'Warrior', 'compelling', 'drama', 'strong', 'obvious', 'comparisons', 'Rocky', 'What', 'film', 'dynamic', 'not', ""'will"", 'underdog', 'rise', 'up', 'win', 'trope', 'will', 'brothers', 'perhaps', 'literally', 'kill', 'other', 'whilst', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'rise', 'personal', 'shared', 'demons', 'slaughter', 'opponents', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Bain', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'character', 'Tommy', 'Riordan', 'genuinely', 'concern', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'estranged', 'brother', 'Brendan', 'Conlon', 'also', 'MMA', 'fighter', 'when', 'two', 'finally', 'meet', 'cage', 'Brendan', 'certainly', 'underdog.Pacing', 'cage', 'entire', 'film', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Paddy', 'Conlon', 'ravaged', 'patriarch', 'sons', 'metaphorically', 'fighting', 'past', 'abuses', 'trying', 'apologize', 'children', 're-establish', 'lives', 'fight', 'too', 'brutal', 'dance', 'sons', 'are', 'accomplished', 'art', 'resistance', 'creating', 'distance', 'space', 'peppering', 'one-two', 'emotional', 'shots', 'aimed', 'reminding', 'bruises', 'placed', 'souls', 'fight', 'many', 'child', 'unfortunately', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'what', 'movie', 'end', 'fight', 'get', 'there', 'may', 'leave', 'hosting', 'variety', 'emotions', 'dread', 'hope', 'expectation', 'anxiousness', 'disillusionment', 'heartache', 'Great', 'performances', 'liked', 'film', 'lot', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'how', 'decided', 'make', 'Brendan', 'scenes', 'dimmed', 'lighting', 'style', 'graininess', 'film', 'wondered', 'first', 'was', 'something', 'wrong', 'factory', 'defect', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'style', 'only', 'reflected', 'scenes', 'remember', 'correctly', 'other', 'scenes', 'lack', 'graininess', '4.25', 'stars']",N/A

After being away from home for a long long time Tommy (Hardy) comes back to see his father Paddy (Nolte). Across town his brother Brendan (Edgerton) is having financial troubles. The only way the two brothers can find a way to make the money they need is by fighting in an MMA tournament. Tommy asks his father to train him and the family dysfunction grows until the tournament. Regardless of what I say here this is a great movie. My problem with this is that I think my expectations were too high. Any movie that draws comparisons to ""Rocky"" gets my hopes up (like ""The Fighter""). Much like ""Rocky"" though, this movie has the fighting as a secondary plot to the family struggles that are going on. This movie is very interesting in the way that you are not sure who is the ""good"" brother and are not really sure who to root for the entire time. If you have seen ""The Fighter"" you may agree with me when I say that the movie was good but Christian Bale's performance made the movie. Nick Nolte gives that kind of performance in this one. He takes a part that could get glossed over and makes it stand out enough that to me he is the front runner for an Oscar. Overall, a very good movie but my expectations were too high to love it as much as I wanted. Of the last ""fighting"" movies to come out I would have to say this is 3rd on my list.

He directed another great sports film, Miracle.  In this film, we get not one, not two, but three great performances by very gifted actors.  Tom Hardy (Inception), plays Tommy Conlon, a Marine veteran.  He has just returned from the Middle East and is finding it extremely difficult to live a normal life.  Joel Edgerton (King Arthur) plays Brendan Conlon; a physics teacher and former UFC fighter trying to save his home from foreclosure.  The men's father is played by Nick Nolte; a former alcoholic and terrible father to the boys when they were growing up.  Now the brothers enter a Mixed Martial Arts tournament for redemption, and ironically, to bring their family back together.What I liked about the film:The StoryI don't normally explain plot in my reviews, but I have to divulge a little bit here.  The story of the brothers is so good, so intriguing, we're drawn into the film.  At a pivotal age, the brothers are separated due to extreme circumstances (I wont spoil why here).  They each have resentment towards the other, and both resent their abusive, alcoholic father.  But the story is not thrown in your face with flashing lights.  We discover the pain the brothers have gone through in bits and pieces.  All of which comes to light before the finale of the tournament, when the brothers fight each other.  Don't worry, I didn't spoil anything the trailers didn't tell you already.  I also liked how the MMA fighting takes a backseat to the hurt in their hearts.  The best sports films focus on the person, not the sport.The ActingTom Hardy attracted a lot of attention after Inception.  In this film we see a different side of him.  He's angry, bitter and relentless.  But at the same time, he is reserved and in charge.  He walks a fine line between controlled and crazy so well, we never know what he's going to do on screen.  Joel Edgerton has to play a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders.  A mortgage he can't afford, hospital bills, a sick daughter, an absent father and a failed UFC fighter.  His character is the underdog, one that will never quit.  Then there is Nick Nolte, who plays a man trying to get sober.  He's been clean for almost 3 years and is trying his hardest to patch things up with his sons. The three men are riveting.  I was floored by the three men's interactions.  Compelling and entertaining, amazing.The Action / CinematographyThe Mixed Martial Arts in the movie is nicely shot.  There are some wide shots from the bleachers, as well as up-close, in your face action shots. The character development scenes are nicely shot. Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi creates tension with a slightly bouncy camera shot that feels like it's someone eavesdropping on the conversation.  Great stuff.The ScoreI've said it before and I'll say it again; score is so incredibly vital to a movie.  As I've gotten older, I've developed an ear for the score in films.  And one thing I noticed is, score can make or break a sports film.  Mark Isham creates a wonderful soundtrack that evokes tremendous emotion.  The highs are extremely high and the lows are extremely low.  Nicely done.The ClimaxI have been fortunate enough to be blessed with an incredible brother.  He has been my best friend since he was born.  We've lived together as room mates until the day I was married.  And with that being said, we had some great fights throughout our lives.  But there's something about a brother's love that can't be explained.  You can fight and hurt each other, only to make up five minutes later.  The climax of the movie is the culmination of years of pain and suffering by both men.  They both have pent up anger and frustration towards the other.  They are both fighting to move on from a troubled past.  They're both fighting for prize money that will solve their economic woes.  The fight itself, along with the aforementioned cinematography and score create an unbelievable build up to the climax.  I wont give anything away, but I will tell you this; my sold-out theater went from weeping for the characters to literally a standing ovation.  It was so powerful, and so emotionally gripping, it will stay with me for a long long time.What I didn't like about the film:The PacingI understand pacing and editing are purposefully done (for the most part).  But the first and second act (before the tournament) needed to be touched up a bit.  There are character development moments essential to the build up; however, there are other scenes that needed to be re-cut and sped up.  It is my opinion that these long, drawn out scenes could have been cut down and you wouldn't lose anything towards the overall story arc.The Verdit:An amazing metaphor on so many levelsSports can be a great metaphor for the different struggles in our lives.  The underdog vs. the front runner, picking yourself back up, feeling like we're up against the ropes, etc.  Commentary on the wars in the Middle East, alcoholism, our country's current economic downturn, the housing market and drug use are all touched on in this two hour film.  Give it up to great writers, a great director, terrific acting and a solid story.  It's very VERY rare I see a movie twice in the theaters, but this will definitely be one of them.  Now everyone call your brothers and tell them how much you love them.  Then go see this film with them.",5,"Warrior review; an amazing film about family, forgiveness & picking yourself back up",1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,5464,"['Ever', 'trailer', 'debuted', 'knew',

You end up hoping neither one of them will lose. That's the situation in this thoroughly engrossing mixed martial arts film. Something I never thought I'd say after teen-filled drama Never Back Down released in 2008 that used unlicensed MMA bouts as a backdrop.Brendan Conlon (played by Joel Edgerton) is a man who gave up fighting professionally for his wife Tess (played by Jennifer Morrison) with whom he now has two daughters. Tommy Riordan (played by Tom Hardy) left home with his mother to escape his father's abuse and joined the Marines after she passed. Brendan (Edgerton) is now staring at a debt he can't overcome thanks to his mortgage and goes back to professional fighting in the form of parking lot bouts with inexperienced opponents. And when a video of one of these bouts on the internet is seen by his boss (Kevin Dunn), the principal of the high school where he teaches science, the winner-take-all event is his only hope to avoid foreclosure and relocation. Tommy (Hardy), on the other hand, made a promise to the family of a fallen comrade and intends to keep it no matter what that might mean for his competitors. That includes Brendan who is only revealed to be Tommy's brother well into the film.I'm not really a fan of MMA. I had a passing interest in boxing at one time, watching it that is, but it passed. That said, a well-made film can make any sport, with the exception of curling, seem interesting. And while some may see the release of this film as being too soon after the critically-acclaimed 2010 Mark Wahlberg film The Fighter, or as some sort of Rocky rip-off, I see a well-made, well-acted, realistic film about two men determined to fulfill their obligations the best way they know how.

Joel Edgerton & Nick Nolte also played it out you forget that they are actors & not the people in the movie. When a actor(s) makes you think they are that person(s), they are doing a very good job.

I recognized all the actual players in MMA off-screen and know the history behind the story of Koba, I think they did a really neat thing of trying to replicate that story for the casual observer but the fight sequences, while choreographed fairly well to simulate real violence in the cage, were still pretty odd and couldn't shake their hollywood choreography feeling.  I recognized Anthony ""Rumble"" Johnson (Midnight), Nate Marquardt, the others seemed like actors.What I found to be really good were the performances by the supporting cast--Tommy Rierdon and Patty Conlon (Nick Nolte).  Nick Nolte actually did a really good job of portraying a recovering alcoholic trying to make penance for his transgressions against his sons in the past.  The story developed that plotline pretty well.  Tommy's character was easily the most intriguing AND polarizing, you really wanna like this guy but he's got some real demons but overall, you can't ignore the charisma his stage presence brings to the film.  The main character's performance was mostly humdrum for me...sometimes he seemed credible in his character and other times, it was very 80s-esque trying to recapture the magic of Rocky and the underdog overcoming the insurmountable odds before him.That was my problem with the film, it carried 80s-like predictability and some of the fighting was just not very authentic, the 5-min rounds lasted maybe 60 seconds on-screen and it's painfully obvious, I think they should've been a little more faithful with trying to capture that element of MMA, it's not a big deal and prolly won't take anything away from the movie for most, but for the hardcore MMA fans out there, watch it with your tongue in cheek.Patty Conlon, Tommy Rierdon, and the rest of the supporting cast really shined but the story line had its pitfalls reminiscent of 80s good overcomes evil films and the main actor borrowed too much credibility on credit.  To the point where you realize the credit will not be paid back!Looking forward to seeing more productions with the actor who played Tommy Rierdon, I recommend this as a strong 'should watch' film, but falling just shy of a 'must watch' film.",3,solid 3.5/5.0,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,2337,"[""'m"", 'pretty', 'avid', 'follower', 'MMA', 'kinda', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'promotions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'almost', 'UFC', 'produced', 'seen', 'very', 'many', 'Pride', 'events', 'recognized', 'actual', 'players', 'MMA', 'off-screen', 'know', 'history', 'story', 'Koba', 'think', 'did', 'really', 'neat', 'thing', 'trying', 'replicate', 'story', 'casual', 'observer', 'fight', 'sequences', 'choreographed', 'fairly', 'well', 'simulate', 'real', 'violence', 'cage', 'were', 'still', 'pretty', 'odd', 'could', ""n't"", 'shake', 'hollywood', 'choreography', 'feeling', 'recognized', 'Anthony', 'Rumble', 'Johnson', 'Midnight', 'Nate', 'Marquardt', 'others', 'seemed', 'found', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'were', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Tommy', 'Rierdon', 'Patty', 'Conlon', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'actually', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'trying', 'make', 'penance', 'transgressions', 'sons', 'past', 'story', 'developed', 'plotline', 'pretty', 'well', 'Tommy', 'character', 'was', 'easily', 'most', 'intriguing', 'polarizing', 'really', 'wan', 'guy', 'got', 'real', 'demons', 'overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'charisma', 'stage', 'presence', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'performance', 'was', 'mostly', 'humdrum', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'credible', 'character', 'other', 'times', 'was', 'very', '80s-esque', 'trying', 'recapture', 'magic', 'Rocky', 'underdog', 'overcoming', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'was', 'problem', 'film', 'carried', '80s-like', 'predictability', 'fighting', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'authentic', '5-min', 'rounds', 'lasted', 'maybe', '60', 'seconds', 'on-screen', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'think', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'little', 'more', 'faithful', 'trying', 'capture', 'element', 'MMA', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'prolly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'movie', 'most', 'hardcore', 'MMA', 'out', 'there', 'watch', 'tongue', 'cheek.Patty', 'Conlon', 'Tommy', 'Rierdon', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'shined', 'story', 'line', 'had', 'pitfalls', 'reminiscent', '80s', 'good', 'overcomes', 'evil', 'films', 'main', 'actor', 'borrowed', 'too', 'much', 'credibility', 'credit', 'point', 'where', 'realize', 'credit', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'paid', 'back', 'Looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'productions', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Rierdon', 'recommend', 'strong', ""'should"", 'watch', 'film', 'falling', 'just', 'shy', ""'must"", 'watch', 'film']",N/A

In today's culture, though, boxing has been replaced by mixed martial arts as the fight game of choice.  This is a movie that speaks to that culture.For a basic plot summary, ""Warrior"" tells the story of two brothers.  Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is a high school physics teacher moonlight as a UFC fighter in parking lots at night for the money.  Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is a former Marine and former high school wrestling champion.  Their only two common interests?  Hatred of their father Paddy (Nick Nolte), and the opportunity to win the biggest even in their sport of choice.Simply put, ""Warrior"" is ever bit as good as ""The Fighter"" (in fact, both films share many of the same superb characteristics).  This movie is a human drama first, with MMA fighting being the backdrop for the dramatic material.  It is a visceral story that is not simple in any sense of the word.  It is very dramatic, to be sure, yet it still maintains a very healthy grip on character relationships and thus stays as true to reality as possible.  There are shades of grey in everything, with nothing being cut-and-dry.For hardcore MMA fans, ""Warrior"" also offers some great fight scenes and action.  When you are watching the fights, it seems as if you are truly watching a live UFC event.Thus, ""Warrior"" is a top-notch drama that compares very favorably to the best fight films ever produced.  It will truly make you care about the characters and be rooting for them (or even against them) in a variety of complex ways.
