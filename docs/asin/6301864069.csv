This series of ""Ernest"" movies is mostly slapstick humor with some Varney faces and resembles a live cartoon. This is considered one of the best of the series.In this movie Jim Varney plays a double role as a hardened convict and an aspiring bank janitor. Due to extenuating circumstances they trade places. And his faithful dog (Rimshot) is canned. Now before you recoil I mean the canine is restrained from exposing the imposter by being restrained in a trash can.

Worrell who is a janitor at a bank but he wants to be a clerk but Ernest's boss Mr. Pendlesmythe won't give him the job and Ernest's co-worker/girlfriend Charlotte helps back Ernest up, meanwhile Jim Varney has another role in this movie as 'Nash' who is a cold hearted prisoner that is on deathrow and Nash's cellmate Rubin kills a fellow inmate while trying to escape. Meanwhile Ernest is on jury duty for the crime and there's a hilarious scene when Ernest was chewing on his pen and the ink comes out and while he was trying to wipe the ink off, the judge askes Ernest ""Excuse me sir, are you all right?""""Just Fine, Thank You.""And Rubin realizes that Ernest looks exactly like Nash and the trial resumes at the scene of the crime and before you know it, the switch is on meaning Nash and his other cellmate Lyle beat him up and changed each other's clothes meaning Nash walks away with the jury duty and Ernest is now a prisoner and it takes a while for him to realize that he's in JAAAAAIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLL!!!!!The scenes with Ernest and the head guard are hilarious, meanwhile Rubin was acquitted with the murder charges and is going to finish his previous sentence and Nash is living Ernest's life, and Rubin tells Ernest that he has to be Nash or else. Later on in the movie Ernest later realizes that he's on deathrow and Nash is attempting to rob the bank and kidnaps the two security guards and Charlotte.Will Ernest get out of deathrow alive, will Ernest finally get out of jail. In order to find out, watch this movie cause it's a classic, even if you're not a diehard fan of the Ernest movies but love comedies, then you should give this movie a try.But the DVD version is no different than the VHS and it would be perfect if it had deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer and movie previews.

Although I was already a mature adult, I found this film most compelling from the very first scene. To my surprise, the script is surprisingly detailed and the comedy came without profanity, overt violence or sex. In short, this is a film I could watch with my young children [at the time] or elderly mother without feeling uncomfortable about what was being shown and said on the screen.WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT: WHAT IS ANY 'ERNEST' FILM ABOUT?Ernest somehow manages to turn jury duty into a dead-end -- literally. Somehow he is spirited away during the trial and exchanged for a death-row dead-ringer of himself. Ernest must somehow survive an execution and save his friends on the outside from his evil look-alike, Mr. Felix Nash, who's criminal plans include the liquidation of all of Ernest's friends.

I will get to that later.I always loved the Ernest movies when I was a kid, and even today at age 20, I still find them as funny and humerous as I did when I was little, if not more.  ""Ernest Goes to Jail"" is by far my favorite Ernest movie.Ernest always seems to get in trouble, and this movie is no exception.  Ernest P. Worrell works as a janitor at a bank; or at least TRYING to work.  Things go horribly wrong when Ernest is framed by a ruthless convict who looks EXACTLY like him, and is sent to the big house.  While the evil look-alike is living his life, Ernest has to make it out of jail alive in hopes of proving his innocence.  But of course, as always, nothing ever comes easy for Ernest.  And the results are hillarious.Jim Varney is as hillarious as ever in this out-of-control comedy.  Forget Jim Carrey, THIS guy was the king of physical comedy.  He also takes the challeng of playing TWO roles; playing Ernest, and the evil convict, Nash.  And as goofy as this movie is, it actually has a creative story and plot.The DVD, on the other hand, is not so great.  Be warned: it is FULLSCREEN.  I don't care if this is a comedy, it should be widescreen.  Now, I wouldn't had mind if this movie had not been shot in widescreen, but from what I can remember, this one WAS in theatres, so it HAD to have been shot in widescreen format.  But, I guess I can let that slide, since I have never seen the movie in widescreen, and being used to seeing it in fullscreen.  The picture quality is so-so; not bad, but not great.  Might as well have watched it on VHS.  However, the sound quality is really good.Special features?  There aren't any.  So don't go searching for them, because they aren't there.  Nothing.  I would've been satisfied with at least one theatrical trailer.All in all, ""Ernest Goes to Jail"" is an awesome movie; despite how poor the DVD is.  It's still funny, even today.  I almost gave the DVD 3stars, but the movie is so good, I didn't want to give it too much of a low rating.  So, I'll settle for 4 stars.  Just keep in mind if the DVD wasn't so poor, I would've had no problem giving it 5 stars.  It's a 5 star movie on a 2 star DVD.

Innocent screw-up Ernest is a nighttime bank janitor with dreams of becoming a daytime clerk. When he receives a jury summons in the mail, he is thrilled to have a chance to do his civic duty, but Ernest falls prey to the plot of a malicious prison inmate that is his exact double. After arranging a special ""field trip"" for the jury to the local penitentiary, look-alike Felix Nash switches places with Ernest. Suddenly, Ernest is a highly respected and feared prison inmate and the evil Mr. Nash is filling in for Ernest at the bank! His escape attempts repeatedly thwarted, things really heat up for Ernest when he realizes he is, in fact, on death row! Meanwhile, Mr. Nash has designs on Ernest's would-be girlfriend AND the bank vault! The only thing that might be able to save everybody now is Ernest's amazing ability to gain electrical and magnetic ""powers"" every time he gets electrocuted, which happens a lot!The late, great Jim Varney is at the top of his game in 1990's ""Ernest Goes To Jail,"" the 3rd film based on his hugely popular television personality. Together with hilarious Ernest staples Chuck (Gailard Sartain), Bobby (Bill Byrge), and Rimshot the dog, Ernest gets big laughs in the big-house and wows the audience with an amazingly opposite double-roll! As Ernest, Varney is loving and childlike as ever. As Felix Nash, Varney is a cold-blooded, ruthless criminal! And, yes, Auntie Nelda shows up too! Barbara Tyson plays the cute coworker who has captured Ernest's heart, and Randall ""Tex"" Cobb is his soft-hearted cellmate. The DVD is disappointingly barren of extras, not to mention in the barbaric fullscreen format, but for any true Ernest fan, this film is still a must have!

271107,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,6301864069,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[2, 2]","Jim Varney gives a somewhat ""different"" performance in this particular Ernest movie. He plays Ernest to a T with the madcap physical comedy mixed with some oddly intelligent (yet stupid... weird eh?) dialog. Only this time Varney gets to stretch his acting a bit by playing some different characters. Well... one different character. The rest are Ernest doing impersonations. Still this is a treat for any fan of slapstick comedy.Varney's new character, Felix Nash, is a hardened criminal and Jim does a good job with the differences between Felix and Ernest. You still see much of Varney's signature facial expressions on this new character, however there is enough in the subtle differences that make it convincing. You also get to see Auntie Nelda of Varney's TV show make an appearance. A very funny character indeed. Top it all off with Ernest making impressions on various movie characters and you get a lot of Jim Varney talent in one movie.As others have said this movie is a laugh riot, but don't expect sophisticated comedy. This is comedy with crazy and unrealistic things happening, jokes that don't require too much thought, and Varneys classic takes on camera. You also get Ernest regulars Chuck and Bobby as overzealous bank security guards, and add so much flavor and additional laughs as well.Okay enough about the movie itself, which is funny and family friendly. This DVD is just wasted potential if you ask me. For one it's done in full screen, not widescreen. That in of itself is insulting considering how easy it is to put in both if they wanted to. Also the picture isn't exactly digital quality. I'm not going to fault them for not spending money to do a digital cleanup, but no widescreen?Anothing thing I find rather disturbing is I know for a fact there is some additional footage (a few minutes of funny stuff at least) not seen in the theaters. They have shown this ""director's cut"" on television from time to time so I also know there is a workable print of this additional footage. This DVD doesn't have it. Which I find more disappointing than anything else. I mean TNT is showing this cut!! It's like Disney just doesn't care at all about this DVD they released.In short the movie is great. The DVD is sorely lacking. Good thing it's considered one of those ""value"" DVD's that cost less than $10. If you don't have this movie on VHS then I still recommend getting it for the price.

He hopes to work his way up to being a bank clerk, but there's little chance of that.  He gets electrocuted while fiddling around with his floor waxer and it messes his whole body up, because every now and then throughout the film he becomes magnetized and metal objects begin chasing him around.He has a crush on his coworker at the bank and finally gets a date with her.  On the date, he wears the same old vest and brown cap he always wears.A few days later, he gets a jury duty summons, and is actually delighted that ""out of hundreds and thousands of people they could have picked, they chose me.""  After the trial starts, he's chewing on a pen as he listens to the case, and the pen busts in his mouth, in what has to be my favorite scene in the entire movie.The defendant in the case notices that Ernest looks exactly like a fellow inmate of his, a convicted killer and bankrobber known as Mr. Nash.  The defendant arranges for the jury to have a look at the jail where his alleged crime took place and a switch is made between Mr. Nash and Ernest.  With Mr. Nash on the jury, the defendant is found innocent, and Mr. Nash tastes freedom as everyone thinks that this psychotic hardcore killer is plain old kind-hearted Ernest now.Poor dumb Ernest is in jail for quite some time before he figures out what has happened.  He figures he's just been ""sequestered"" as a juror.  Ernest then finds out from other prisoners that he was switched with Mr. Nash, and unless Ernest acts like Mr. Nash to avoid suspicion, the real Mr. Nash who is as free as a bluebird will do bodily harm to his friends.When Mr. Nash is scheduled to be executed, the warden takes Ernest to the electric chair, but, because he was electrocuted earlier in the movie, he doesn't die.  Instead he becomes ""Ernest P. Warrel - Electroman.""  He escapes from prison and goes to check on his buddies.  He finds Mr. Nash robbing his bank and tries to save the day.  He's electrocuted again by the bank's security system, and starts floating in the air.  Talk about a really weird scene.  Anyhow, Ernest uses his superpowers to stop Nash, and all is well once again.One thing I noticed is that unlike other Ernest movies, this one doesn't have any kids in it.  I don't know if you could call it an adult movie, but adults can sure get some enjoyment out of this.  I know kids enjoy it too, and even though there are implications of violence during certain scenes of the film, it's a very clean movie, as all of Ernest's movies are.  Perhaps this is the only family film you can find with jail as the setting.Great movie for Ernest fans, and even people who don't like his clumsy character will probably enjoy this one.",4,You like Ernest?,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,2915,"['probably', 'favorite', 'Ernest', 'movies', 'Man', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'was', 'great', 'performer', 'was', 'sorry', 'hear', 'passed', 'away', 'few', 'years', 'ago.In', 'Ernest', 'movie', 'Ernest', 'bank', 'janitor', 'terrible', 'job', 'work', 'way', 'up', 'being', 'bank', 'clerk', 'little', 'chance', 'electrocuted', 'fiddling', 'around', 'floor', 'waxer', 'whole', 'body', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'film', 'magnetized', 'metal', 'objects', 'begin', 'chasing', 'around.He', 'crush', 'coworker', 'bank', 'finally', 'date', 'date', 'same', 'old', 'vest', 'brown', 'cap', 'always', 'wears.A', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'jury', 'duty', 'summons', 'actually', 'delighted', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'people', 'could', 'have', 'picked', 'chose', 'trial', 'chewing', 'pen', 'case', 'pen', 'busts', 'mouth', 'be', 'favorite', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie.The', 'defendant', 'case', 'Ernest', 'exactly', 'fellow', 'inmate', 'convicted', 'killer', 'bankrobber', 'known', 'Mr.', 'Nash', 'defendant', 'jury', 'have', 'look', 'jail', 'where', 'alleged', 'crime', 'took', 'place', 'switch', 'made', 'Mr.', 'Nash', 'Ernest', 'Mr.', 'Nash', 'jury', 'defendant', 'found', 'innocent', 'Mr.', 'Nash', 'freedom', 'everyone', 'psychotic', 'hardcore', 'killer', 'plain', 'old', 'kind-hearted', 'Ernest', 'now.Poor', 'dumb', 'Ernest', 'jail', 'quite', 'time', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'just', 'been', 'sequestered', 'juror', 'Ernest', 'then', 'out', 'other', 'prisoners', 'was', 'switched', 'Mr.', 'Nash', 'Ernest', 'Mr.', 'Nash', 'avoid', 'suspicion', 'real', 'Mr.', 'Nash', 'who', 'as', 'free', 'bluebird', 'will', 'do', 'bodily', 'harm', 'friends.When', 'Mr.', 'Nash', 'scheduled', 'be', 'executed', 'warden', 'Ernest', 'electric', 'chair', 'was', 'electrocuted', 'earlier', 'movie', ""n't"", 'die', 'Instead', 'Ernest', 'P.', 'Warrel', 'Electroman', 'prison', 'check', 'buddies', 'Mr.', 'Nash', 'robbing', 'bank', 'tries', 'save', 'day', 'electrocuted', 'again', 'bank', 'security', 'system', 'floating', 'air', 'Talk', 'really', 'weird', 'scene', 'Anyhow', 'Ernest', 'superpowers', 'stop', 'Nash', 'well', 'once', 'again.One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'other', 'Ernest', 'movies', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'call', 'adult', 'movie', 'adults', 'can', 'sure', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'know', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'too', 'even', 'are', 'implications', 'violence', 'certain', 'scenes', 'film', 'very', 'clean', 'movie', 'Ernest', 'movies', 'are', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'family', 'film', 'can', 'find', 'jail', 'setting.Great', 'movie', 'Ernest', 'fans', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'clumsy', 'character', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one']",N/A

Jim Varney was one of the most talented and sadly, underrated, comedic actors in the history of film.  See why in this movie.  It's a comedic gem.I just wish Disney spent the time and money to give the DVD release the justice it deserves. How soon they forget that this film tripled it's production budget at the box office.  So what gives?  The film transfer is bad (granted it's still much better than watching it on VHS), it's not widescreen, and finally, there are absolutely no special features.  The only positive thing about this DVD is the audio quality.In conclusion, &quot;Ernest Goes to Jail&quot; is certainly Jim Varney's masterpiece, but Touchtone Pictures should be ashamed for not giving this film the quality DVD treatment it deserves.",4,The best of the Ernest series!,1059868800,"08 3, 2003",2003,862,"['quot', 'Ernest', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'quot', 'easily', 'greatest', 'Ernest', 'series', 'classic', 'own', 'right', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'sadly', 'underrated', 'comedic', 'actors', 'history', 'film', 'See', 'why', 'movie', 'comedic', 'gem.I', 'just', 'wish', 'Disney', 'spent', 'time', 'money', 'give', 'DVD', 'release', 'justice', 'How', 'soon', 'forget', 'film', 'tripled', 'production', 'budget', 'box', 'office', 'what', 'film', 'transfer', 'bad', 'granted', 'still', 'much', 'better', 'watching', 'VHS', 'not', 'widescreen', 'finally', 'are', 'absolutely', 'special', 'features', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'DVD', 'audio', 'quality.In', 'conclusion', 'quot', 'Ernest', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'quot', 'certainly', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'masterpiece', 'Touchtone', 'Pictures', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'not', 'giving', 'film', 'quality', 'DVD', 'treatment']",N/A
