812870,A30CZB6BX494JG,B0001UNF4M,"blackturtle ""blackturtle.us""","[2, 7]","This movie was highly produced. A lot of time was put into the photography and the soundtrack. The acting was also quite acceptable. The problem is that the writers/director hit you over the head with the message of the film. They go to great lengths to portray stereotypical characters and predictable events which make it impossible for anyone to miss their intended message. While imparting the message of racial tolerance is laudible, it should be done with a little more subtlety (even if this is a movie aimed at an under ten-year-old audience). This movie is a perfect example of a mediocre story which has been raised beyond its potential through heroic efforts in its production.The other major flaw of this movie is the way it ends. It seems that another ten minutes was added to the end of the movie just to provide sufficient length. Cutting it off a bit sooner would have been an improvement... also leaving out the horrendous song at the end would have been a great idea!",2,"Professional, But Lacking",1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,985,"['movie', 'was', 'highly', 'produced', 'lot', 'time', 'was', 'put', 'photography', 'soundtrack', 'acting', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'acceptable', 'problem', 'writers/director', 'hit', 'head', 'message', 'film', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'portray', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'predictable', 'events', 'make', 'impossible', 'anyone', 'miss', 'intended', 'message', 'imparting', 'message', 'racial', 'tolerance', 'laudible', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'little', 'more', 'subtlety', 'even', 'movie', 'aimed', 'ten-year-old', 'audience', 'movie', 'perfect', 'example', 'mediocre', 'story', 'been', 'raised', 'potential', 'heroic', 'efforts', 'production.The', 'other', 'major', 'flaw', 'movie', 'way', 'ten', 'minutes', 'was', 'added', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'provide', 'sufficient', 'length', 'Cutting', 'off', 'bit', 'sooner', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'improvement', 'also', 'leaving', 'out', 'horrendous', 'song', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'idea']",N/A

One for homeschooling also, since they have need of learning about relationships outside their own family.This is a heartwarming story of the friendship that evolved between a Mexican boy, Oscar, from a migrant family, and a tom-boy girl, Ira, tom-boyishly short for Iris, who lives on the beet farm the migrants work on.  It shares much about the bigoted conditions of the 1960s which for some have yet to get better.  Through films like this, perhaps that day will arrive for more.There is even a parent guide with family discussion questions on the back of the DVD box.  Let Oscar and Ira teach values and human respect to children you know.

812873,ABC8FXLD7W528,B0001UNF4M,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[3, 3]","Friendship's Field takes us back to the 1960s when tomboy Ira's life changes forever and leaves her with a memory long into adulthood.Prejudice toward migrant workers is rampant in Ira's hometown, but her family is different. They see people for who they are, despite cultural differences, color of skin, and social status. During a particular summer in 1965, Ira befriends Oscar, the son of migrant workers. But what happens when some local teenagers take their anger and prejudice out on Oscar's brother?However, Friendship's Field is not all serious. Not by a long shot. There is plenty of humor, including Ira's decision to pester her three older sisters, whom she refers to as ""the poofheads.""There are plenty of great discussion starters in this movie including -1.Everyone is made in the image of God and why it's important to see people as God sees them,2.Loving your neighbor, no matter who that might be, and3.Being a leader, rather than a follower, and standing up for what is right.There is nothing objectionable in this movie. However, there are a couple of scary parts involving a snake and an incident of mild violence, which may scare younger children.This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I would highly recommend it!

It is the story of an inter-racial friendship forged during a time  when prejudice was high and such things were frowned upon. The two kids were just two kids who became best friends. It was a good movie for explaining to my children that even though we have cultural differences with other people, they are still people just like us.
