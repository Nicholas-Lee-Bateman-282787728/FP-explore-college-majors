He has a loose cannon friend, a pretty girlfriend, and an overweight gentleman on his team. Of course, the loose cannon screws the plan up majorly, and the master thief gets caught. After prison, the master thief tries to make amends with his daughter. He fails miserable at first, but then he gets his chance to make good by rescuing her. The storyline is very predictable.  It was kind of unrealistic, and I just wasn't into it.I'll be seeing other Nicolas Cage movies. I really enjoy watching him do his thing on screen.

First of all the basic plot is 'they stole his daughter now he wants her back.' Sounds like the movie 'Taken,' but this isn't like Taken even if that is the basic plot. Let me start by saying that Nick Cage plays a master bank robber that starts the movie with a team of 3 others. From the start, the cops know the plan and they're right there waiting to sting the group. There is a great opening bank heist and I was thinking it would be bad, but its surprisingly clever and tense in all of the good ways. I'm not going to spoil anything with the first sequence, but after the heist one of Cage's cronies ends up kidnapping Cage's daughter. The villain is memorable and will stand out as unique and well played. Cage is more on a quest that forces him to take leads and takes him all across the city of New Orleans.The movie excels with creativity, bank heists and twists that keep the action going as Cage comes closer to finding his daughter. However, Cage isn't the type to just kill everyone or torture them to get information. He still throws some punches here and there and pulls a gun, but he's no killer. The action isn't over the top or excessive as in some movies, it has a nice pace and can amp up the intensity like out of the frying pan and into the fire.While this isn't a AAA action movie, it is well worth a watch for the action, story, villain and inventiveness of the writer.

Will's daughter, Alison, is eventually kidnapped after his release by his former partner;  he demands his share of the money from the botched bank job- money Will burned to save himself. Now, Will has 12 hours to rob another bank while being tracked by the investigator that originally caught him. Stolen is a solid action film.The story in this film is okay- it is clich&eacute;, and you've probably seen it many times before. It has a few great action sequences, including car chases, fist fights, and the like. It consistently pushes forward with these action scenes, so it never feels like it drags. What I'm saying is: the film has its moments. However, there are a lot of scenes that feel illogical or unrealistic; for example, Will's extremely easy infiltration of an FBI building and constant escapes from authority, and Alison's inept ability to escape (she pokes a hole through a seat and instead of shouting through it, she tries to poke the customer; she briefly escapes and runs down a dead end alley and doesn't even try to overpower the physically disabled villain); I know, I know, it's just a movie, so I digress. Also, although the music was good, it felt out of place, like it belonged in a different film or genre. The acting was good; I have no problems with Nicolas Cage, although I wish he'd play someone other than Nicolas Cage.Overall, Stolen has some great action sequences and moves at a fast pace; it's a very effective time killer.

Brassy 70s vibe combined with modern action sequencing making for an exciting action flick with a non-stop punishing pace. Loved it!Been a while since I screened a good old school heist flick - a cool drink in a parched monotonous desert of movie making.Opens with a 4-person crew whose bank job goes terribly wrong. Fractured internal conflicts about the heist forces the team leader to shoot one of his partners. And worst of all, only he ends up getting busted. Facing a stretch in the joint alone, a full decade passes.Having completed his full federal dime without giving up his crew, he's hoping to reconnect with his old life - the one without the bad. But ten million dollars tends to stick in one's memory, especially for his former buds, whose lives on the outside haven't exactly been all laughs and jollies the past decade.They want their cut - plus interest.And they're willing to do whatever it takes to make Nick Cage's character, Will Montgomery, pay up. Up to and including kidnapping his little girl.What they don't know is that during the night of the robbery, when things went so wrong and he was being chased down by the cops, he knew he was going to get nicked - there wasn't a way out. So, in order to shave time off his sentence, he burned the ten million. Every last dollar literally went up in smoke. He honestly doesn't have the money. Understandably, the remnants of his former crew don't believe him; and as far as they're concerned it's a b.s. con. They want their take and he has exactly 12 hours to pay them or else.The clock is ticking and Will has to: Dodge the unflappable detectives who have also patiently waited for him, convincingly fake having access to the money to keep his former partners from killing his daughter, all while having to figure out in less than twelve hours where to actually get all those millions. Steal it of course, but from where?And the real question: Whom can he really trust?You know, perhaps Nick Cage is indeed as mentally unstable as seen from his captured video antics, surreal interviews and frightful interior design instincts. But when he's in the acting groove - the man is absolutely solid 24K. He won that Best Actor Oscar for a reason; and films like this reveal that amazing talent.A completely believable performance woven into a movie-logical plot. Pretty much a minor miracle nowadays with shoddy screenwriting and insufferable plastic characterizations. What happened to the pride writers used to take towards accuracy? I remember when they would go out with the cops to get a sense of what it was like to be cop. Or gaming access to hang with actual thieves, druggies and murderers to observe and question - capturing their habits so that the director and actors could authentically recreate them for us in the audience.What happened to that level of hardcore writing? This movie is reflective of that old school effort, therefore making this very enjoyable.For me, a very strong four, teetering close to a nickel pointers rating.Movie Note:- 'Stolen' is one of the better films that utilizes a rebuilt Big Easy. Several movie and television productions over the years have tried to do right by the city, but for the most part failed. I take no pleasure in pointing it out, but creating something that reflects poorly on New Orleans and its people isn't helpful, it just makes it and them look unappealing and incompetent.Personal Note (and the spoiler):- Absolutely loved the gold snatch. Why? Because this plot actually made sense. Unlike the original 'Mission: Impossible' version* which I could never reconcile with reality. I know that it takes almost 1600&#730;F of direct concentrated heat to melt pure gold.

holds his own in his leading character.I was shocked to see eight,count 'em EIGHT,executive producers and three producers,to Simon West's lonely directing spot.I would hate to have been in West's position with all those shirts running around telling everyone what to do.It is just more unnecessary fingers in the movie pie.No wonder the accounting systems in studios is so bizarre,with all those bodies to pay;and many that needn't be there in the first place,but are.I guess they have to justify their existence somehow.The film was shot in the Big Easy and has a Fat Tuesday(Mardi Gras in Cajun French)backdrop.The story finds Cage as the head of a group of four,three men and one woman,who have been pulling off robberies for sometime now.They're good at what they do and this night is no different.They are robbing a local bank of its loot;$10 million worth.They enter the vault and Cage is busy putting the money into his sack.His partner meanwhile is enamoured of a cache of gold bars just out of reach behind some steel bars.As the two flee we are also watching the FBI,who have been tracking Cage and company.It seems when they finally move in they're at the wrong location and switch to the correct one.As Cage and his partner flee down an alley a man loading the back of his car comes in brief contact with them.Cage's partner wants to shoot him but Cage must drop the money and physically refrain him from pulling the trigger.In the scuffle Cage shoots his partner in the leg and drags him into the waiting van.Cage goes back for the loot but wailing police sirens spook the other two in the van and off it goes.Cage is forced to steal a police car and flee,but he doesn't get far.He becomes trapped in a parking garage and just before he is arrested he burns the money in a nearby barrel.Eight years later Cage comes out of prison and goes to see his young daughter,but they part with bad feelings.The daughter is off to therapy and Cage seeks out a bar and one of his old friends from the group.As they get reacquainted Cage learns the guy he shot in the leg years before has now died.However a phone call quickly dispels that notion,as his old partner is alive and well,but psychologically not well.It seems he lost the leg Cage shot and has gone downhill ever since.He changed his name and faked his death so when Cage got out he could finally get his fair share of the loot.Cage tells him he doesn't have it but the man doesn't believe him.That cab his daughter got into was HIS cab,and he intends to kill her unless Cage comes up with the money.Cage goes directly to the FBI and the officer that originally arrested him,but he meets with total disbelief.Cage must try and deal with the issue on his own.His old partner phones every so often to give him further instructions and Cage works trying to find him,but never quite does.Cage tracks down the last remaining member of his posse,the one who actually drove away on that night,way back when.Cage pressures him until finally he reveals that he and the other man want their fair share.A fire fight ensues,and the FBI who have been tailing Cage,burst in and shoot Cage's other partner.Cage flees and decides to rob the bank he robbed eight years before,but this time he is after the gold.Armed with a powerful incendiary torch he blasts his way through the floor bottom of the vault,right under the bars of gold.The torch melts the gold,which he in turn flees with.The police are always following Cage,but they never quite are able to catch up to him.Cage is directed to a large theme park where his old partner has his cab with Cage's daughter in the trunk.However his partner not only wants the money but revenge on Cage too.He starts to torch the car but Cage and he wrestle and Cage manages to break away and drive the flaming car into a deep pond.The car starts to sink and Cage is just able to extricate his daughter.Another struggle ensues and Cage finally gets the upper hand and the man ends up unconscious in the trunk,as it sinks into the pond.The film ends as Cage and the female of the original group are now an item and living off the avails of the gold Cage took.The FBI still watch Cage but a piece he found in the back of her pick up,he throws into the water,not wanting any trouble or veil of suspicion regarding the loot.The story/film starts off quite well as we see the group do the heist,the cops go to the wrong place,catch up,a chase ensues and Cage goes to the slammer.However it settles onto its laurels and coasts a bit throughout the rest of the film.Action comes and goes and is sporadic.I applaud the film company for using New Orleans as its location,since it can use all the help it can get since Katrina.Jean Claude Van Damme has used New Orleans a lot before and since Katrina,but I digress.The film needed some tightening after Cage came out of the hoosegow;a little too much unnecessary plot points and veering.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.All in all a decent enough action movie with Cage owning his part and the movie itself,but after his return from prison the picture sits back and coasts,far too much.And because it's the kind of a variation on a theme that we have seen done over and over again over the years,they needed to think and act smarter during its filming and in post production.3- 3 1/2 stars.",3,A pleasing but run of the mill flick-the best thing is Cage,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,5527,"['Stolen', 'released', 'Sept/12', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Will',

Once a great actor, now a second rate Steven Seagal. Stolen, his latest trip to the action-thriller slums is a ludicrous and stupid movie, the sad thing is it's better than a lot of Cage's recent films.Directed by Simon West, who once upon a time helmed the excellent Cage action pic Con Air, way last century as well as the more recent all-star the Expendables 2 and the poorly received Jason Statham as Charles Bronson  uninspired remake of the Mechanic. Stolen, though is a bottom of the barrel take on Taken, as one long boring and badly filmed car chase.Josh Lucas is cast as the film's main antagonist, a so bad it's almost good creation., he's a one legged, mangled handed, long stringy haired, unshaven taxi driver. Why not give him a hook for a hand and an eye patch to complete the effect. He's kidnapped Cage's daughter and wants ten million dollars ransom that Cage stole along with him back when he was whole, this is not a scheme that appear to have been well thought out. It is obvious that it was hatched by an inept criminal. Lucas, a once promising rising star, is outrageously bad here.The dialogue is stilted and awful. The story derivate and the plot simply deplorable, it`s all amateurishly messy. The music terribly lame. The supporting cast is no better than the lazy leads, Danny Huston, a reliable character actor, here plays as a dogged cop on the trail of Cage and the money, but he has never been worst as an actor. All is dreadful here and yet I feel compelled to see every new Cage movie in hopes he will return to his former glory, I dread each new film, but I still seem them. After Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and Seeking Justice, both infinitely worst than Stolen, this has got to come to an end, I don`t think I can take much more.read my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",1,countinued decline,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,1977,"['Has', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'once', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'star', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'given', 'up', 'acting', 'just', 'works', 'autopilot', 'now', 'last', 'movies', 'have', 'given', 'feeling', 'Once', 'great', 'actor', 'now', 'second', 'rate', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Stolen', 'latest', 'trip', 'action-thriller', 'slums', 'ludicrous', 'stupid', 'movie', 'sad', 'thing', 'better', 'lot', 'Cage', 'recent', 'films.Directed', 'Simon', 'West', 'who', 'once', 'time', 'helmed', 'excellent', 'Cage', 'action', 'pic', 'Con', 'Air', 'way', 'last', 'century', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'recent', 'all-star', 'Expendables', '2', 'poorly', 'received', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'uninspired', 'remake', 'Mechanic', 'Stolen', 'though', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'take', 'Taken', 'one', 'long', 'boring', 'badly', 'filmed', 'car', 'chase.Josh', 'Lucas', 'cast', 'film', 'main', 'antagonist', 'so', 'bad', 'almost', 'good', 'creation.', 'one', 'legged', 'mangled', 'handed', 'long', 'stringy', 'haired', 'unshaven', 'taxi', 'driver', 'Why', 'not', 'give', 'hook', 'hand', 'eye', 'patch', 'complete', 'effect', 'kidnapped', 'Cage', 'daughter', 'ten', 'million', 'dollars', 'ransom', 'Cage', 'stole', 'along', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'whole', 'not', 'scheme', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'obvious', 'was', 'hatched', 'inept', 'criminal', 'Lucas', 'once', 'promising', 'rising', 'star', 'outrageously', 'bad', 'here.The', 'dialogue', 'stilted', 'awful', 'story', 'derivate', 'plot', 'simply', 'deplorable', 's', 'amateurishly', 'messy', 'music', 'terribly', 'lame', 'supporting', 'cast', 'better', 'lazy', 'leads', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'reliable', 'character', 'actor', 'here', 'dogged', 'cop', 'trail', 'Cage', 'money', 'never', 'been', 'worst', 'actor', 'dreadful', 'here', 'yet', 'feel', 'compelled', 'see', 'new', 'Cage', 'movie', 'hopes', 'will', 'return', 'former', 'glory', 'dread', 'new', 'film', 'still', 'seem', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Spirit', 'Vengeance', 'Seeking', 'Justice', 'infinitely', 'worst', 'Stolen', 'got', 'come', 'end', 'don', 't', 'think', 'can', 'take', 'much', 'more.read', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",N/A

I wonder when the next one is coming out?"" Nicolas Cage returns to New Orleans to play super thief Will Montgomery, who unfortunately gets nabbed on his first movie heist. After eight years in prison he comes out to an estranged daughter with abandonment issues, who he loves dearly (Sami Gayle), and a bunch of people who want to know where he stashed the money.Will claims he burned the money in a nearby fire, something I imagine that the FBI never bothered to check for ashes as it was a good three feet away from the car which they seen Will emerge. The film description tells us his daughter is kidnapped, to no surprise as the title is ""Stolen"" because Liam Neeson has corned the market on ""Taken."" His former partner Vincent (Josh Lucas) wants his share.Outside of the great soundtrack, the first thing I noticed was the name ""Vincent."" It is the same name used for a vampire in FF VII. Nicolas Cage has recently been outed as a real life vampire (check Google), which he denies. Is a movie industry ploy, dropping clues, i.e. ""Paul is dead"" in order for us see Cage's films?If you have never seen an action film before or a kidnapped daughter film, this is a decent flick.

1597764,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B009L79YFU,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Whenever I see Nicolas Cage's name on a movie poster, I know that no matter the film, I'm going to see a great performance. While Cage has done every conceivable genre, he is of course best know for his action films. In Stolen, Cage once again teams with his Director from Con Air, Simon West, to give us another exciting thriller. Cage plays Will Montgomery, a career criminal who has just spent eight years in prison. Montgomery comes out wanting to start a new life, but that's put on hold when he learns that a former enemy has kidnapped his daughter and is holding her for ransom. I guess no one has ever told Nicolas Cage that you're supposed to slow down with age, because he is just as good in this movie as he is in all his other films. Cage, notorious for performing his own stunts, does some amazing things in this film and is of course pure intensity. In this film he's paired with Josh Lucas who was in a film by the same title in 2009, not to be confused with that movie, Lucas plays Montgomery's partner in crime and throughout this film you can see him and Cage feed off of one another, too me, that was the best part. Lets be honest here, rarely do action films have a decent story to distinguish themselves from one another. Stolen is no different, a daughter in peril, held by a weird foul mouthed bad guy, who is being chased by a want to be hero with a less than stellar reputation, you've seen this dozens of times.  What makes Stolen stand out from those other films is the cast, it's as simple as that. The cast really keeps you interested, even when the movie gets to be predictable and even when the stunts are impossible, the cast keep bringing you back to the edge of your seat, with their great performances and extreme intensity.

He picks a crew and breaks in and steals what he wants when he wants. He has decided on one last heist. Four people, ten million dollars, and they go their separate ways. At the end of the heist one wrong move changes the lives of all four people involved. Eight years later Will is out of prison and ready to start his life over, but nothing is ever easy for an ex-con. Most of you know that I am not a Nicholas Cage fan at all. This movie isn't terrible and he really is toned down in this for the most part but still has a few Cage moments in this. The idea of this is a little overused and like most Cage movies lately the movie feels really cookie-cutter like but I will admit that the movie is pretty fast moving and is entertaining. For a non-Cage fan that's a pretty high remark. Overall, generic but entertaining. I give it a B+.",3,Generic & un-original but it is entertaining.

1597767,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B009L79YFU,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Nicholas Cage plays Will Montgomery, formerly America's most wanted thief. After spending eight years in prison, he comes back to New Orleans to meet his estranged daughter Alison (Sami Gayle). However, Alison is not very happy about her unexpected reunion with her father, and goes away.Then someone calls him, telling Will that he has kidnapped Will's daughter, and demands his share of the last heist: ten million dollars. The problem is, Will doesn't have money. The only person he can trust is an ex-getaway driver Riley (Malin kerman).So, the basic story of ""Stolen"" comes down to this: ""12 Hours"" ""$10 Million"" and ""One Kidnapped Daughter,"" as you can see on the film's poster. The tagline certainly reminds us of a Liam Neeson action thriller ""Taken,"" but Nicolas Cage's latest film takes a more light-hearted approach, with an emphasis on the cat-and-mouse chase between the hero who wants his kidnapped daughter back, and the FBI agent Tim Harlend (Danny Huston), who wants to arrest him.The script penned by David Guggenheim (""Safe House"") is serviceable, but sometimes the story becomes very silly. Bank robbers do not cover their faces. FBI agents keep making incredible mistakes. Even the kidnapped girl doesn't know what she should do (just run!). There are so many plot devices and characters' inexplicable decisions that do not convince.To be fair, solid direction of Simon West (""Con Air""), Mark Isham's nice score and the authentic locations of New Orleans almost make us forget the countless plot holes. After all, ""Stolen"" is a typical B action film from Nu Image / Millennium Films. It's decent, but not special.",3,"Stolen, Not Taken; Nicholas Cage's Decent B Action Thriller",1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,1634,"['Nicholas', 'Cage', 'plays', 'Will', 'Montgomery', 'formerly', 'America', 'most', 'wanted', 'thief', 'spending', 'eight', 'years', 'prison', 'back', 'New', 'Orleans', 'meet', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Alison', 'Sami', 'Gayle', 'However', 'Alison', 'not', 'very', 'happy', 'unexpected', 'reunion', 'father', 'away.Then', 'someone', 'telling', 'Will', 'kidnapped', 'Will', 'daughter', 'share', 'last', 'heist', 'ten', 'million', 'dollars', 'problem', 'Will', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'trust', 'ex-getaway', 'driver', 'Riley', 'Malin', 'kerman', '.So', 'basic', 'story', 'Stolen', 'down', '12', 'Hours', '10', 'Million', 'One', 'Kidnapped', 'Daughter', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'poster', 'tagline', 'certainly', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'action', 'thriller', 'Taken', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'latest', 'film', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'approach', 'emphasis', 'cat-and-mouse', 'chase', 'hero', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'back', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Tim', 'Harlend', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'who', 'arrest', 'him.The', 'script', 'penned', 'David', 'Guggenheim', 'Safe', 'House', 'serviceable', 'sometimes', 'story', 'very', 'silly', 'Bank', 'robbers', 'do', 'not', 'cover', 'FBI', 'agents', 'keep', 'making', 'incredible', 'mistakes', 'Even', 'kidnapped', 'girl', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'just', 'run', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'plot', 'devices', 'characters', 'inexplicable', 'decisions', 'do', 'not', 'convince.To', 'be', 'fair', 'solid', 'direction', 'Simon', 'West', 'Con', 'Air', 'Mark', 'Isham', 'nice', 'score', 'authentic', 'locations', 'New', 'Orleans', 'almost', 'make', 'forget', 'countless', 'plot', 'holes', 'Stolen', 'typical', 'B', 'action', 'film', 'Nu', 'Image', '/', 'Millennium', 'Films', 'decent', 'not', 'special']",N/A

1597770,AMI8149RXQ0M5,B009L79YFU,Zencik,"[0, 1]","Nicolas Cage has not had a good track record lately. His movies over the last 2 years have ranged from forgettable (Ghost Rider 2, Seeking Justice) to downright terrible (Season of the Witch, Trespass). Stolen falls on the lower end of the forgettable batch, but pretty close to the terrible.I went into this knowing pretty much nothing besides the fact the film starred Nicolas Cage and was given a very limited release late last year. I finally came across it on Netflix streaming yesterday and decided to give it a shot.It's impossible to watch this film without feeling like it is a Taken rip-off since the plot revolves around a father trying to rescue his daughter after she is kidnapped. Except Taken did this plot 100x better with a story that had much more depth and was a lot darker. This does the story very bare bones and is as thin as they come.Nicolas Cage does an alright job in his role here. Not a great job, but he is honestly probably doing a better job than he should be here. Everyone else is pretty terrible though. Especially, the girl playing the daughter. She really needs to go back and take some acting lessons before ever stepping in front of a camera again. The cringe-inducing dialogue doesn't and incredibly flat and dull direction doesn't help either.What saves Stolen from being a terrible film are the decent action sequences. There are a few good shooting and chase sequences throughout the film that helped hold my attention through the films run time.Even if you are a fan of Nicolas Cage, it's hard to recommend Stolen. There's nothing it that's memorable at all and is merely just a rip-off of much better action-thrillers. Maybe it will keep you entertained on a rainy day when you have nothing else to watch, but that's just about all it's going to be good for.",2,Cage Can Do a Lot Better Than This,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,1802,"['Nicolas', 'Cage', 'not', 'had', 'good', 'track', 'record', 'lately', 'movies', 'last', '2', 'years', 'have', 'ranged', 'forgettable', 'Ghost', 'Rider', '2', 'Seeking', 'Justice', 'downright', 'terrible', 'Season', 'Witch', 'Trespass', 'Stolen', 'lower', 'end', 'forgettable', 'batch', 'pretty', 'close', 'terrible.I', 'went', 'knowing', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'fact', 'film', 'starred', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'was', 'given', 'very', 'limited', 'release', 'late', 'last', 'year', 'finally', 'came', 'Netflix', 'streaming', 'yesterday', 'decided', 'give', 'shot.It', 'impossible', 'watch', 'film', 'feeling', 'Taken', 'rip-off', 'plot', 'around', 'father', 'trying', 'rescue', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'Taken', 'did', 'plot', '100x', 'better', 'story', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'was', 'lot', 'darker', 'story', 'very', 'bare', 'bones', 'as', 'thin', 'come.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'alright', 'job', 'role', 'here', 'Not', 'great', 'job', 'honestly', 'probably', 'doing', 'better', 'job', 'should', 'be', 'here', 'Everyone', 'else', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'Especially', 'girl', 'playing', 'daughter', 'really', 'go', 'back', 'take', 'acting', 'lessons', 'ever', 'stepping', 'front', 'camera', 'again', 'cringe-inducing', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'incredibly', 'flat', 'dull', 'direction', ""n't"", 'help', 'either.What', 'saves', 'Stolen', 'being', 'terrible', 'film', 'are', 'decent', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'shooting', 'chase', 'sequences', 'film', 'helped', 'hold', 'attention', 'films', 'run', 'time.Even', 'are', 'fan', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'hard', 'recommend', 'Stolen', 'nothing', 'memorable', 'merely', 'just', 'rip-off', 'much', 'better', 'action-thrillers', 'Maybe', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'rainy', 'day', 'when', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'good']",N/A
