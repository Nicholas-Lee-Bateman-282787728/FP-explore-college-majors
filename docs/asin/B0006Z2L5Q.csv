875433,A27DHFFWMH042Y,B0006Z2L5Q,"Cathleen M. Walker ""geminiwalker""","[6, 6]","This is a story about the shame that binds us, and the truth that sets us free. It's about adolescent love, classism, racism, and a love that crosses all the boundaries.Regina Taylor is a class act, and plays her characters with dignity and grace. Playing a woman who is fully expected to sacrifice her life for the family she works for, Ms. Taylor does as fine a job in this feature as she does in the TV series ""I'll Fly Away"" with Sam Waterston - one of my all time favorites.When she loses her child to whooping cough, Cora's dedication to the little white girl she cares for, who was her daughter's friend, deepens. The story becomes more tragic as the true nature of the little girl's relationship with her own mother is based on the mother's shame, lies, and secrets. The way that shame plays out causes devastating effects to unfold until you just don't think you can take it any more.And the power of the truth reveals how liberating honesty can be.When Abortion Was Illegal: Untold StoriesRambling Rose",5,Can you handle the truth?,1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,1012,"['story', 'shame', 'truth', 'free', 'adolescent', 'love', 'classism', 'racism', 'love', 'boundaries.Regina', 'Taylor', 'class', 'act', 'characters', 'dignity', 'grace', 'Playing', 'woman', 'who', 'fully', 'expected', 'sacrifice', 'life', 'family', 'Ms.', 'Taylor', 'fine', 'job', 'feature', 'TV', 'series', ""'ll"", 'Fly', 'Away', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'one', 'time', 'child', 'whooping', 'cough', 'Cora', 'dedication', 'little', 'white', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'daughter', 'friend', 'deepens', 'story', 'more', 'tragic', 'true', 'nature', 'little', 'girl', 'relationship', 'own', 'mother', 'based', 'mother', 'shame', 'secrets', 'way', 'shame', 'out', 'causes', 'devastating', 'effects', 'unfold', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'take', 'more.And', 'power', 'truth', 'how', 'liberating', 'honesty', 'can', 'be.When', 'Abortion', 'Was', 'Illegal', 'Untold', 'StoriesRambling', 'Rose']",N/A

875437,A3EH95KDNNUMWT,B0006Z2L5Q,margaret todd,"[0, 0]","Now here is a great heart-felt movie. About the life journey of a young woman who is in service to a family. And the events in Cora's life with her daughter and daughter of her employer. Regina Taylor is wonderful in this movie. It's a believeable story and just so touching.A young black woman in a mostly white small town, who falls in love and is left with the joy of her life. In this movie it shows the wonderful, the good in some also with side by side with the uncareing and no heart. I saw this years ago and really like it, glad I found it for my own now. The tittle is right for the movie and tells how Cora feels and acts in her life. Unashamed to love and care. Some subject matter may not be good for children. I think teenagers(girls) though would really like this movie and appeals to different races also. It is mostly a woman's movie, no guns or car chases for sure. But a very thoughtful , heartfelt movie about life and how it affects mostly the choices women make.  I loved it, cause there is a saying in it, that touched my heart, being a parent also thinking back when my children were a lot of work. I won't spoil it, so you find out if the same words from Cora touches your heart also.",5,one of the best stories,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,1209,"['Now', 'here', 'great', 'heart-felt', 'movie', 'life', 'journey', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'service', 'family', 'events', 'Cora', 'life', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'employer', 'Regina', 'Taylor', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'believeable', 'story', 'just', 'so', 'touching.A', 'young', 'black', 'woman', 'mostly', 'white', 'small', 'town', 'who', 'love', 'left', 'joy', 'life', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'good', 'also', 'side', 'side', 'uncareing', 'heart', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'found', 'own', 'now', 'tittle', 'right', 'movie', 'how', 'Cora', 'feels', 'acts', 'life', 'Unashamed', 'love', 'care', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'children', 'think', 'teenagers', 'girls', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'movie', 'appeals', 'different', 'races', 'also', 'mostly', 'woman', 'movie', 'guns', 'car', 'chases', 'sure', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'heartfelt', 'movie', 'life', 'how', 'mostly', 'choices', 'women', 'make', 'loved', 'cause', 'saying', 'touched', 'heart', 'being', 'parent', 'also', 'thinking', 'back', 'when', 'children', 'were', 'lot', 'work', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'find', 'out', 'same', 'words', 'Cora', 'touches', 'heart', 'also']",N/A
