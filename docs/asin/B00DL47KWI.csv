1657497,A1N3F1KNLXYQZA,B00DL47KWI,Birder Girl,"[3, 7]","A dud, despite superior cast.  The movie does not know if it is serious or a spoof and misses the mark on both. If you liked ""Bridesmaids"", this is nowhere near as wickedly ironic.If you fancy a comedy about a self-deluding woman who crashes into reality, see ""Young Adult"", with Charlize Theron.  It's bitter and hilarious.The story lines are similar: superficial woman hates her upbringing, thinks she will take the big city by storm, gets dumped by rich boyfriend, landlord,  and snooty faux-friends, and goes home to face the music .""Young Adult"" focuses on selfish Theron's developing some humanity: ""Girl Most"" focuses on hangdog Wiig needing prozac because she can't stay in NYC with all the beautiful people even though she has no talent and is boring everyone to death.There are the ubiquitous ""partying drunk"" scenes.""Girl"" plays as an over-long spoof with all the exceptional cast forced to play goofy stereotypes that would have been okay in a 5 minute, SNL skit . I have to blame the script on this one.  The attempt at a romantic storyline between Wiig and Criss flops.  He clearly has acting talent and screen appeal and tries to sell it but there is no chemistry at all in their grope scene.  Also, he is the only actor who is playing his role seriously.  Benning is waaaaay too beautiful to be Wiig's mother, but she adds the only comic relief against Wiig's bloodhound-droopy face.  We've seen Matt Dillon do his crazy/looney role before and it is getting boring here as Bening's boyfriend.  Bob Balaban is his usual hermetically-sealed robot-self as her long-lost, successful-writer father who feels absolutely no interest in the two kids he sired in his youth. Then, she saves her family from an assassin who is stalking Dillon,  by jumping him while wearing her mollusk-obsessed brother's invention, a people-sized protective shell.

1657500,A1JZZLIVXGJSIB,B00DL47KWI,CinemaMinor,"[0, 1]","The main character is Imogene, as played by Kristen Wiig, and she is just too shallow and half-baked a person to care about.  I get what the movie was trying to do, but a movie like &#34;Young Adult&#34; -- while considerably more uncomfortable to watch -- does it much, much better.  Or, if you're looking for something lighter, it's worth revisiting an old Parker Posey vehicle like &#34;Party Girl.&#34;  &#34;Girl Most Likely&#34; wants to present the viewer with a woman who is a completely self-absorbed, un-self-aware mess, and have the audience rooting for her -- and that's just not possible.For a little background, Imogene grew up in the Atlantic City, NJ area with an eccentric mother (played very enjoyably be Annette Bening) and a brother who's a little odd and needy (also a very good performance).  Imogene flees her family for NYC, where she doesn't experience the meteroic rise as a playwright she'd hoped for, but still, she clings to the idea of being part of the sophisticated city milieu.  Unfortunately, her suave, live-in boyfriend breaks up with her, she loses her job -- and she ends up in a psych ward.  Imogene is then put in the care of her estranged mother and finds herself back in Jersey, a place for which she has a chronic contempt.  Imogene's mother has taken in a boarder (another strong performance as given by Darren Criss of &#34;Glee&#34;), who becomes a reluctant companion to Imogene as she struggles to reestablish herself in NYC.There are some laughs in the film, but Wiig is really only given caustic humor to work with; almost everything out of her mouth is negative and mean.  Imogene's loving relationship with her brother, Ralph, is designed to show her softer side, I think -- but it only serves to make the character less believable as there are no traces of that heart of gold anywhere else in her life.  The character is completely devoid of empathy.  Along those lines, it is not believable that Imogene has any talent as a writer.  She has no clue her boyfriend and friends don't really care for her, has no insight into what is going on with her famiy; she pays attention to absolutely nothing.  Yet she's a gifted playwright?  (In &#34;Young Adult&#34; the main character writes books for teenage girls, underscoring that she has no depth, not contradicting it.)In order for a character to be redeemed, it has to be believable that she's redeemable, and while watching this movie I never bought that Imogene was someone who was just a little lost.  She has major issues and flaws.  In contrast, despite their problems, her mother and brother are pretty fleshed out, likable characters.  While this is kind of the point, Imogene needed a little more of what they got.  Matt Dillon, who I always love seeing onscreen, has a turn as the mother's wacky boyfriend.  While the character is meant as a foil for Imogene, his part of the storyline takes the movie to a really ridiculous place, and it stays there.  There's also a subplot involving the supposed death of Imogene and Ralph's father that works at first, but eventually becomes silly in a bad way.So why 3 stars?  Because I enjoyed Annette Bening that much.  And Christopher Fitzgerald gives a really sweet performance as Ralph.  There are moments where the writing is strong and the family dynamics are portrayed very well.  But overall, I never even wanted to like Imogene.(As an aside, there's a major faux paus in the movie when Darren Criss's character is pumping his own gas in NJ -- it's illegal to do so.)",3,"Some good writing and performances in places, but it's impossible to root for the main character",1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,3524,"['main', 'character', 'Imogene', 'played', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'just', 'too', 'shallow', 'half-baked', 'person', 'care', 'get', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'movie', '34', 'Young', 'Adult', '34', 'considerably', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'much', 'much', 'better', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'lighter', 'worth', 'revisiting', 'old', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'vehicle', '34', 'Party', 'Girl.', '34', '34', 'Girl', 'Most', 'Likely', '34', 'present', 'viewer', 'woman', 'who', 'completely', 'self-absorbed', 'un-self-aware', 'mess', 'have', 'audience', 'rooting', 'just', 'not', 'possible.For', 'little', 'background', 'Imogene', 'grew', 'up', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'NJ', 'area', 'eccentric', 'mother', 'played', 'very', 'enjoyably', 'be', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'brother', 'who', 'little', 'odd', 'needy', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Imogene', 'family', 'NYC', 'where', ""n't"", 'experience', 'meteroic', 'rise', 'playwright', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'still', 'idea', 'being', 'part', 'sophisticated', 'city', 'milieu', 'Unfortunately', 'suave', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'up', 'job', 'up', 'psych', 'ward', 'Imogene', 'then', 'put', 'care', 'estranged', 'mother', 'back', 'Jersey', 'place', 'chronic', 'contempt', 'Imogene', 'mother', 'taken', 'boarder', 'strong', 'performance', 'given', 'Darren', 'Criss', '34', 'Glee', '34', 'who', 'reluctant', 'companion', 'Imogene', 'reestablish', 'NYC.There', 'are', 'laughs', 'film', 'Wiig', 'really', 'only', 'given', 'caustic', 'humor', 'work', 'almost', 'everything', 'mouth', 'negative', 'mean', 'Imogene', 'loving', 'relationship', 'brother', 'Ralph', 'designed', 'show', 'softer', 'side', 'think', 'only', 'make', 'character', 'less', 'believable', 'are', 'traces', 'heart', 'gold', 'anywhere', 'else', 'life', 'character', 'completely', 'devoid', 'empathy', 'lines', 'not', 'believable', 'Imogene', 'talent', 'writer', 'clue', 'boyfriend', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'insight', 'what', 'going', 'famiy', 'attention', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'gifted', 'playwright', '34', 'Young', 'Adult', '34', 'main', 'character', 'books', 'teenage', 'girls', 'underscoring', 'depth', 'not', 'contradicting', 'order', 'character', 'be', 'redeemed', 'be', 'believable', 'redeemable', 'watching', 'movie', 'never', 'bought', 'Imogene', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'lost', 'major', 'issues', 'flaws', 'contrast', 'problems', 'mother', 'brother', 'are', 'pretty', 'fleshed', 'out', 'likable', 'characters', 'kind', 'point', 'Imogene', 'needed', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'got', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'who', 'always', 'love', 'seeing', 'onscreen', 'turn', 'mother', 'wacky', 'boyfriend', 'character', 'meant', 'foil', 'Imogene', 'part', 'storyline', 'movie', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'place', 'there', 'also', 'subplot', 'involving', 'supposed', 'death', 'Imogene', 'Ralph', 'father', 'first', 'eventually', 'silly', 'bad', 'way.So', 'why', '3', 'stars', 'enjoyed', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'much', 'Christopher', 'Fitzgerald', 'really', 'sweet', 'performance', 'Ralph', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'writing', 'strong', 'family', 'dynamics', 'are', 'portrayed', 'very', 'well', 'overall', 'never', 'even', 'wanted', 'like', 'Imogene', 'aside', 'major', 'faux', 'paus', 'movie', 'when', 'Darren', 'Criss', 'character', 'pumping', 'own', 'gas', 'NJ', 'illegal', 'do', 'so']",Girl Most Likely

Michelle Morgan seems to have taken that advice while writing the script for this movie.Here's the scoop. Imogene Duncan (Kristen Wiig) Attempts suicide after her boyfriend leaves her and she loses her job. She's forced to move into her mother's house where she is confronted with an odd assortment of characters and a personal odyssey ensues.I like Kristen Wiig. I like the work she did on SNL and her attempts in film, to break away from her TV persona have, for my dollar, been successful. She doesn't disappoint here. I like the character she's built. She's someone who squandered her potential as a play write and needs to fight her way back while exorcizing her demons. She really is oblivious to how others view her. She's a stick in the mud and doesn't know how to pick her fights. The odd folk around her, including her cloistered brother, help her to see the world a different way. This is a fun ride.As I mentioned, there are a lot of surprises in the script. It rarely rode the path I expected and that kept me in the game. The supporting roles from Annette Bening, Matt Dillon et al were all good. It's not a flashy film but it can't be. The directing, editing, music, etc. are all on par with the content.I suppose I can pick at this, that or the other thing but it would,t lessen my overall enjoyment of this little gem.",4,Movie Most Likely to Surprise,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,1437,"['Someone', 'forget', 'who', 'said', 'writing', 'script', 'always', 'do', 'something', 'audience', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Michelle', 'Morgan', 'have', 'taken', 'advice', 'writing', 'script', 'movie.Here', 'scoop', 'Imogene', 'Duncan', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Attempts', 'suicide', 'boyfriend', 'job', 'forced', 'move', 'mother', 'house', 'where', 'confronted', 'odd', 'assortment', 'characters', 'personal', 'odyssey', 'ensues.I', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'work', 'did', 'SNL', 'attempts', 'film', 'break', 'away', 'TV', 'persona', 'have', 'dollar', 'been', 'successful', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here', 'character', 'built', 'someone', 'who', 'squandered', 'potential', 'play', 'write', 'fight', 'way', 'back', 'exorcizing', 'demons', 'really', 'oblivious', 'how', 'others', 'view', 'stick', 'mud', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'pick', 'fights', 'odd', 'folk', 'including', 'cloistered', 'brother', 'help', 'see', 'world', 'different', 'way', 'fun', 'ride.As', 'mentioned', 'are', 'lot', 'surprises', 'script', 'rarely', 'rode', 'path', 'expected', 'kept', 'game', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'et', 'al', 'were', 'good', 'not', 'flashy', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'directing', 'editing', 'music', 'etc', 'are', 'par', 'content.I', 'suppose', 'can', 'pick', 'other', 'thing', 'would', 't', 'lessen', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'little', 'gem']",Girl Most Likely

1657540,AOZFQAPPLMVOB,B00DL47KWI,"Lone Alaskan Gypsy ""Lone Alaskan Gypsy""","[0, 0]","I love Kristen Wiig- and her name caught my eye, which lead me to watch this film. Having no previous insight to the film, I delved in having only read the very 50/50 comments here on Amazon. A lot of people seem to want to compare this film to Bridesmaids, and I'm not sure why. Granted, one of the lead actresses from Bridesmaids is a lead actress in this film as well- but why should that mean this film is going to be anything similar to Bridesmaids? It's not, and I- for one- was thrilled that it took a refreshing right turn from Bridesmaids.This film follows Imogene (Kristen's character) on her humbling fall from fame (or 'almost fame') as a playwright. Amidst losing everything, she finds the important things. The story is fairly predictable, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth a watch. It's beautifully constructed, full of entertaining and loveable characters, and thoroughly dabbled with witty humor.Contrary to many people, I didn't find Bridesmaids terribly gut-wrenchingly funny. I found it mediocre. Not one of my favorite films. But this film, to an extreme contrast- I found intelligently humorous. The entire film was filled with subtle and quirky jokes that everyone could relate to. I found myself giggling throughout the entire movie. The sweet dialogue passed between Imogene and her family is both relatable and utterly spirited. I found myself relating to her more and more as the film went on.The film does have a few surprising twists and turns. When all put together it creates an unrealistic but very entertaining storyline that kept me head-over-heels in love with the movie. I loved every last minute of it and found myself rooting for each of the characters. The film does an amazing job of taking even the most serious of moments and filling them with sarcastic humor that makes the film enjoyable (even for cry-baby women like myself who can find a reason to tear up during virtually any movie). This film, although having its typical ups and downs keeps a relatively light mood to it.

What could possibly go wrong? Well, try everything...And then the diced carrots really hit the fan when brash Zelda her bed-hopping gambling-addicted mother shows up from New Jersey in a stolen car...on loan from her new boyfriend who calls himself George Bousche and claims to be an undercover CIA agent with possible Samurai consciousness tie-ins (hilarious turns by Annette Bening and Matt Dillon). Imogene rapidly loses her boyfriend, her job, her apartment and her fair-weather socialite pals - eventually ending up back in Ocean City in rental Hell in her ""Friends"" teeshirt instead of snazzy clothes.Only now her old room has been let out by gambler Mom to a complete stranger who doesn't change the sheets that often (a handsome turn by Darren Criss) and Imogene has also to live and deal with Ralph - her almost mentally challenged younger brother who won't go any further than the boardwalk and whose fixated on crabs and the invention of a human shield like the outer crusts of molluscs (a part that could so easily have been awful superlatively played by Christopher Fitzgerald). Then it gets worse. Only now does Imogene learn that Mum's hopeless parenting might even extend to lies about her supposedly dead father. Maybe he's a genius author right now - very much alive and well and living like a millionaire in a plush townhouse back in the New York area she just lost...Co-Directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini and written by Michelle Morgan from her own experiences - ""Girl Most Likely"" as you can imagine is a bit all over the place story-wise - but it's undeniably witty and at times very touching - a hard combo to get right. And it has superb roles for women - hitting a lot of those mid-life crisis points along its convoluted but merry way. A lot of the fun credit has to go the two superlative women leads  - Kristen Wiig and Annette Bening whose scenes together are electric - Bening getting the look, the swagger and the god-awful garish clothes of Zelda absolutely spot on. But they're not to be outdone by the men in what was obviously a 'nice' movie to work on - good material made by good people.The BLU RAY picture quality is beautiful throughout and stretched to the full screen. But don't watch the 'making of' extra first - it rather stupidly gives away too many key scenes - especially those featured towards the end of the movie.Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the cinematic imagination - but this little film has heart and laughs and is a lot better than most.

That includes this middling comedy, romance, drama. Wiig plays a dysfunctional and unpopular failed writer living in New York City.  Once on the fast track with a new play that failed, she's now in a deep funk, buoyed only by her boyfriend (Brian Petsos) who is about to dump her.  In an effort to lure him back, Imogene (Wiig) fakes a suicide attempt which lands her in the psych-ward.  The hospital, being full, sends her home with her mother (Annette Bening) back to Ocean City, N.J.Not having been back for years, Imogene is surprised that Zelda (Bening) is sharing a bed with some sort of secret agent (Matt Dillon).  Her old bedroom is being rented out to Lee (Darren Criss), who sings in a Backstreet Boys cover band.  Brother Ralph (Christopher Fitzgerald) completes the household.  Imogene tries to get her mojo back, and finds a little romance with the younger Lee.  He helps her get back to the city to attend a book release party of a supposed friend.  A new wrinkle in the plot comes in the form of Imogene and Ralph's father (Bob Balaban), who was believed to be dead.  At least that's what mom told the siblings when they were very young.  Finding out about this lie, leads to an unfortunate reunion.While this film isn't terrible, it wastes the talent of Wiig and Bening.  The story, while perhaps interesting, is convoluted to a fault.  The romance between Imogene and Lee doesn't feel right.  The comedy is limited to Imogene's reactions and expressions and Zelda's weirdness.  But they are both pretty normal compared to the crackpot inventor, Ralph.  In the end, it's hard to feel much sympathy for any of the characters.  The film is at its best when Bening and Wiig are on the screen at the same time.  This is a modestly, watchable film.  Just don't expect ""Bridesmaids.""The Blu ray transfer comes in a 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  While the picture isn't eye-popping, it is certainly well done.  Images are sharp and well defined.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  This is a dialog heavy film so there's little to expect in surrounds other than street noise and other ambient sounds.  Dynamic range is limited, but there is really nothing particularly bad.  Dialog is clear and that's what counts.  Extras are limited to a gag reel, a short piece on Ralph's ""invention,"" a making of short and some deleted scenes.

Having seen that it is STILL playing at that same theatre, curiosity got the better of me and I finally went to see it.""Girl Most Likely"" (2013 release; 103 min.) brings the story of Imogene (played by Kirsten Wiig), a thirty-something woman in New York who is down on her luck. As the movie opens, we see how first she is dumped by Peter, her boyfriend of many years, and then how she is fired from her job as a magazine writer. In sheer desperation to try and win Peter back, Imogene fakes a suicide try (including a fake farewell note, written so well that Imogene later comments ""I could be a professional suicide writer!"", by far the best line in the movie). Rather than Peter coming back, Imogene, after a short hospital stay, ends up being released into the custody of Zelda, her gambling-addicted mom (played by Annette Bening) and moves in with her back in Ocean City, NJ. Turns out Zelda has rented out Imogene's room to Lee, a twenty-something singer who performs in a cheesy casino play. Zelda's boyfriend (played by Matt Dillon) thinks/claims he is a CIA operative and goes by 'George Bush'. There is also Imogene's brother and dad who have a fringe role. At that point we are about 30 min. into the movie and the table is pretty much set for these wacky character to play out their roles. Will Peter and Imogene get back together? Can Imogene and her mom finally get along? To tell you more would be, well...Several comments: I am generally speaking quite finicky in choosing the movies that I go see, and if I know beforehand there is little chance I will not like the movie, I won't go. With this movie, my curiosity was peaked because (i) it is playing for several weeks at my local art-house theatre, so obviously people are seeing it, otherwise it'd be gone already, (ii) I had low expectations going in, and (iii) it's freakin' Kirsten ""Bridesmaids"" Wiig, so how bad can it really be? Not to mention that Wiig also executive-produced this movie, so surely she had more than a hand in the final product. Alas, I am sorry to tell you that all the rumors are true. This is supposed to be a comedy, and do you want to know how many times I laughed? Not a single time, I mean not even a chuckle! This is all the more surprising, given that this was directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, who are more than capable. The most likely explanation is that the script was outright weak, beyond the point of salvage. About 80-85 min. into the movie, there is a plot twist (don't worry, I won't reveal) that is so out-of-nowhere and so weak, that I was utterly bewildered and exasperated. I decided to leave the theatre right then and there, as I had already spent too much time with this movie.Wiig, Bening and others may try as hard as they can, but they cannot save this witless and flat-lined movie from the dud that it is. What a tremendous waste of talent! In all honesty, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, not even Wiig die-hards. Save yourself the trouble, the time and your money, and check out something else instead (such as the underrated and actually excellent ""Friends With Kids"" from last year, also starring Wiig).

I was surprised how much I enjoyed the film. Kristin Wigg plays Imogene, a young woman who received an award as one of the best potential playwrights, and now has lost the buzz. She has a handsome boyfriend who does not seem as interested in her as she is in him. She has found the society life, but does not seem to be a good fit.When one thing leads to another, she finds herself back in Ocean City, NJ, in the home of her mother, whom she has not seen for years. Zelda, mom, is wonderfully played by Annette Bening. Hers is probably the best acted part of the film. A kooky lady who likes to gamble. She lives with an alleged CIA agent named George Bousche, played by Matt Dillon. Imogene finds her old room has been rented out to a young man, Lee, played by Darren Criss. Her brother, Ralph, played by Christopher Fitzgerald, is a nice young man with some sort of disability. Trying to find her bearings, Imogene needs to decide what she really wants in life. Can she revive her career? Can she live with her family in the homemade sheet bed in the living room? Some laughs, some great acting by Annette Bening and the film does try to stay on track.

The film smartly copies the theme and to some extent, the characters of the famous film.Imogene (Kristen Wiig/Dorothy) is forced to go back home from NYC (Oz) to her family home in Ocean City, N.J. Her mother (Annette Bening/ Glenda) is over the top and lives with a younger man, George the Boushe (Matt Dillon/ Cowardly Lion) who claims he is CIA and has been a Samurai for 25 years, but seems more like a con artist. Her seeming half-wit brother Ralph (Christopher Fitzgerald/ Scarecrow) likes crabs and creates an infinite stream of metaphors about homes and protection. Imogene has discovered her room has been rented out to Lee (Darren Criss/ Tin Man) a man who is deeper than what is seen on the surface.Imogene's goal is to return to Oz and find the Wizard (Bob Balaban).This is not a great comedy by any means.
