This is an excellent addition to my collection.  Every one of the performers is extremely talented.  They all look like they're having a great time, the music is high energy and fun.  Since I can't seem to make it to any of their concerts in person, this is the next best thing.",5,Beautiful DVD,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,400,"['discovered', 'BN', 'year', 'ago', 'have', 'bought', 'CD', 'concert', 'DVD', 'love', 'excellent', 'addition', 'collection', 'one', 'performers', 'extremely', 'talented', 'look', ""'re"", 'having', 'great', 'time', 'music', 'high', 'energy', 'fun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'concerts', 'person', 'next', 'best', 'thing']",N/A

Like another reviewer stated, this is a great companion to Castle and Dreams.  Don't compare them, enjoy them.I know that some in this list didn't care for it, but since this another aspect of a band that defies categorization, it is hard to rate one to the other.Paris Moon is recommended - but I have to point the good and the bad.  The good are excellent performances of Play Minstrel Play, World of Stone, Home Again, Streets of London, and the Fires of Midnight.  A show stopper was Ariel a cover of the song Candace wrote for Rainbow. The bad was the missing songs - Winds of Mandalay and Just Call My Name.  Even the video of the later would have really set this offering apart.  For other songs I just go to Castles & Dreams.",4,Another Stellar DVD,1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,831,"['time', 'when', 'are', 'forced', 'suffer', 'lesser', 'artists', 'Blackmore', 'Night', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'great', 'companion', 'Castle', 'Dreams', 'Do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'enjoy', 'them.I', 'know', 'list', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'aspect', 'band', 'categorization', 'hard', 'rate', 'one', 'other.Paris', 'Moon', 'recommended', 'have', 'point', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'are', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Play', 'Minstrel', 'Play', 'World', 'Stone', 'Home', 'Again', 'Streets', 'London', 'Fires', 'Midnight', 'A', 'show', 'stopper', 'was', 'Ariel', 'cover', 'song', 'Candace', 'wrote', 'Rainbow', 'bad', 'was', 'missing', 'songs', 'Winds', 'Mandalay', 'Just', 'Call', 'My', 'Name', 'Even', 'video', 'later', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'set', 'offering', 'apart', 'other', 'songs', 'just', 'go', 'Castles', 'Dreams']",N/A
1104289,A3F3D064D0QW95,B000VVE2TS,Neil Barto,"[1, 2]","Blackmore's Night is one of my favorite groups and I've been waiting for another DVD release since the last one ""Castles & Dreams"" came out a few years ago. This is a fantastic DVD with some of the best sound I've heard with the DTS audio. What's also nice is that it comes with a CD of about half the songs included on the DVD. ""Paris Moon"" contains some great songs from Blackmore's early CD's as well as a few from their newest ""Village Lantern"". The documentary extra is short, running at aprox. 9 minutes, but it gives some detail on how they come about creating their music and songs. Not quite Rock, not guite Renaissance, not quite Folk, but a little of all three, this is a must for everyone.",5,Blackmore's Night rocks Paris,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,701,"['Blackmore', 'Night', 'one', 'favorite', 'groups', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'release', 'last', 'one', 'Castles', 'Dreams', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'fantastic', 'DVD', 'best', 'sound', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'DTS', 'audio', 'What', 'also', 'nice', 'CD', 'songs', 'included', 'DVD', 'Paris', 'Moon', 'great', 'songs', 'Blackmore', 'early', 'CD', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'newest', 'Village', 'Lantern', 'documentary', 'extra', 'short', 'running', 'aprox', '9', 'minutes', 'detail', 'how', 'come', 'creating', 'music', 'songs', 'Not', 'quite', 'Rock', 'not', 'guite', 'Renaissance', 'not', 'quite', 'Folk', 'little', 'three', 'must', 'everyone']",N/A

Paris Moon is a brilliant dvd given the fact that it is well recorded, video and audio wise. I enjoyed Castles & Dreams but I definitely give the thumps up to Paris Moon. The collection gets better. The electric guitar work by the master is undoubtedly the best part of the show along with the vocalist. If you are an RB, BN or CN fan, say no more.

Not sure what it is about Blackmore's Night but this overtook Blind Guardian as my favorite and they aren't even a comparison.  I now have all their albums between actual CD Releases and iTunes Purchases.  So as not to go on about the band in general, we are all here to know what this LIVE DVD is about.Many bands seem to do great in the studio but you hear their live work and it's, well, nothing short of awful.  Blackmore's Night is just the opposite.  Candace's vocals are simply amazing, no matter how they are recorded.  And their talented Musicians get plenty of 'show off' time too.  It's like they play 'Studio Quality' on the road, not in that they are exactly identical.  No.  They are different but just as good as the originals.  Just Great song selection, excellent quality of music and this DVD goes by before you even realize it.  Because of this DVD, I now know I want to see this band play 'Live'.Sorry, not very good at writing reviews, but if you like Blackmore's Night, and want to hear their Live work, don't hesitate!MAC Owners, Please Note!  I originally thought I had a defective DVD, the sound was wavy and going loud and quiet nonstop.  Was driving me crazy. But I found the solution. In your DVD Player Preferences, go to the Disc Setup tab, and check the box that says ""Disable Dolby dynamic range compression"".

1104292,A19VXN50IDDQCT,B000VVE2TS,Vince Palamara,"[20, 23]","Don't get me wrong: I love ""Castles & Dreams"" and all things Blackmore, as well, but, dare I say it, I find this DVD a tad BETTER than the last Blackmore's Night DVD. Why? I think the main performance is more inspired and VIRTUOSO in its depth: longer solos and more keyboard interplay. Unlike the band Kansas, not having the violin does *not* detract from this band in the least. In actual fact,Ritchie's amazing guitar---and the other musicians, too---shine even more without the addition of a violin player. Particular standouts are ""World Of Stone"", ""Fires at Midnight"", ""Ariel"", and even ""Home Again"", a track I felt was cute but kind of lame on the studio version.I must admit that, when I first saw the track listing and so on, without having viewed the DVD yet, I thought Ritchie and Co. were merely ""biding time"" until another substantive release was forthcoming (and, yes, I also felt, again without having seen the DVD yet, that ""Castles & Dreams"" HAD to be the better of the two, was more definitive, and, frankly, ""why bother""?).
