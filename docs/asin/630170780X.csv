It delighted us as it had done when we first saw it as children on Walt Disney's weekly program. Patrick McGoohan is delightful as the Scarecrow. When he dons the costume of the Scarecrow, shedding his daily role as Vicar of a seacoast parrish, he seems to let go all his inner penchant for play-acting. He growls his words, his cackling laugh is chilling, his ruthless decrees seem brutal. Yet he always has as his goal  helping the oppressed people of brutal King George III by selling smuggled goods to pay their taxes for them. This might be a little too dark for children under 8 but I think children older will appreciate the themes of justice, fairness, and rebelliousness with cause that run through the story. It is beautifully filmed but there is a problem with lighting as so much of the action takes place at night. Still, McGoohan's Scarecrow is a character you won't soon forget.",5,"Dr. Syn, Alias the Scarecrow",1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,974,"['have', 'looked', 'story', 'many', 'years', 'gave', 'husband', 'Christmas', 'delighted', 'had', 'done', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'children', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'weekly', 'program', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'delightful', 'Scarecrow', 'When', 'costume', 'Scarecrow', 'shedding', 'daily', 'role', 'Vicar', 'seacoast', 'parrish', 'let', 'go', 'inner', 'penchant', 'play-acting', 'words', 'cackling', 'laugh', 'chilling', 'ruthless', 'decrees', 'seem', 'brutal', 'always', 'goal', 'helping', 'oppressed', 'people', 'brutal', 'King', 'George', 'III', 'selling', 'smuggled', 'goods', 'pay', 'taxes', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'dark', 'children', '8', 'think', 'children', 'older', 'will', 'appreciate', 'themes', 'justice', 'fairness', 'rebelliousness', 'cause', 'run', 'story', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'problem', 'lighting', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'place', 'night', 'Still', 'McGoohan', 'Scarecrow', 'character', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget']","Dr. Syn, Alias the Scarecrow VHS"
262691,A1KD93LN4BHUT3,630170780X,Dumb Ox,"[12, 12]","Around every Halloween time, The Wonderful World of Disney aired this Colonial-era masterpiece over three long weeks, keeping us in suspense as to how it would all turn out.  This movie had everything:  adventure, scary costumes(those masks seriously freaked us out when we were little), misty moors, and brave villagers crushed under burdensome taxes struggling against the big bad redcoats.  It was Robin Hood clearly influenced by Zorro!  The lead character---mild-mannered vicar Dr. Christopher Syn by day and the fearsome Scarecrow of Romney Marsh by night---is wonderfully portrayed by the great actor Patrick MacGoohan.  The rest of the cast was solid, too, as was the historical detailing, and the costumes and scenery were nicely done.  The overall theme of the corrupt being exposed and brought to justice was well-handled and lacking in unnecessary melodrama; right prevailed over evil, as it usually did in a Disney film, but this one was more balanced and better produced than many others.  Please, Disney, PLEASE release this one on DVD so our children can enjoy it, too!  The world---or at least us rabid fans of The Scarecrow---will be eternally grateful.",5,Please PLEASE Release This Title On DVD!,1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,1171,"['Halloween', 'time', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'aired', 'Colonial-era', 'masterpiece', 'three', 'long', 'weeks', 'keeping', 'suspense', 'how', 'would', 'all', 'turn', 'out', 'movie', 'had', 'everything', 'adventure', 'scary', 'costumes', 'masks', 'seriously', 'freaked', 'out', 'when', 'were', 'little', 'misty', 'moors', 'brave', 'villagers', 'crushed', 'burdensome', 'taxes', 'struggling', 'big', 'bad', 'redcoats', 'was', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'clearly', 'influenced', 'Zorro', 'lead', 'character', '-mild-mannered', 'vicar', 'Dr.', 'Christopher', 'Syn', 'day', 'fearsome', 'Scarecrow', 'Romney', 'Marsh', 'night', '-is', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'great', 'actor', 'Patrick', 'MacGoohan', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'solid', 'too', 'was', 'historical', 'detailing', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'were', 'nicely', 'done', 'overall', 'theme', 'corrupt', 'being', 'exposed', 'brought', 'justice', 'was', 'well-handled', 'lacking', 'unnecessary', 'melodrama', 'right', 'prevailed', 'evil', 'usually', 'did', 'Disney', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'balanced', 'better', 'produced', 'many', 'others', 'Please', 'Disney', 'PLEASE', 'release', 'one', 'DVD', 'children', 'can', 'enjoy', 'too', 'world', '-or', 'least', 'rabid', 'fans', 'Scarecrow', '-will', 'be', 'eternally', 'grateful']","Dr. Syn, Alias the Scarecrow VHS"

I tuned in on this movie assuming (and we all know what happens when you assume) that intelligent folks like the Disney people would have put this out on DVD ages ago. I should have known better - I have a government job, I should be used to foolishness...This movie affected me like few others in my childhood and fostered a rabid interest in history and all things British. I still remember how Dr Syn got a copy of the cell door key that he used to free the wrongly-incarcerated young man (whose importance, sadly, is lost to me); if I ever need that information, it's right there in my head. The masks were great; I loved the big gray horse (hey, I  was a kid!);and we were so wrapped up in the story, we even got my grumpy dad involved in it. It was released as an extra in my area in the 70s I believe - I remember being thrilled to enjoy it all over again and saw it then a bunch of times. I hope Disney really does release it as a DVD soon (along with The Swamp Fox, The Fighting Prince Of Donegal,and The Prince and the Pauper) so a whole new generation of kids can be inspired and enlightened.",5,great minds think alike,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,1192,"['Well', 'never', 'dreamed', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'there', 'same', 'thought', 'tuned', 'movie', 'assuming', 'know', 'what', 'when', 'assume', 'intelligent', 'folks', 'Disney', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'ages', 'ago', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'have', 'government', 'job', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'foolishness', 'movie', 'affected', 'few', 'others', 'childhood', 'fostered', 'rabid', 'interest', 'history', 'things', 'British', 'still', 'remember', 'how', 'Dr', 'Syn', 'got', 'copy', 'cell', 'door', 'key', 'used', 'free', 'wrongly-incarcerated', 'young', 'man', 'importance', 'sadly', 'lost', 'ever', 'need', 'information', 'right', 'there', 'head', 'masks', 'were', 'great', 'loved', 'big', 'gray', 'horse', 'hey', 'was', 'kid', 'were', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'story', 'even', 'got', 'grumpy', 'dad', 'involved', 'was', 'released', 'extra', 'area', '70s', 'believe', 'remember', 'being', 'thrilled', 'enjoy', 'over', 'again', 'saw', 'then', 'bunch', 'times', 'hope', 'Disney', 'really', 'release', 'DVD', 'soon', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'Fighting', 'Prince', 'Donegal', 'Prince', 'Pauper', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'inspired', 'enlightened']","Dr. Syn, Alias the Scarecrow VHS"

Chickowski,"[9, 9]","I had been trying to find this movie forever but I forget the title had Dr. Syn in it, but once I found it it was all that I remembered it to be with the exception of the film quality.  The copy I found was, I thought, poor quality with distortions and so I was disappointed. I want my own copy and hope that Disney would remaster this movie into a DVD and clean up the distortions, etc.  However, the movie is what movies should be, exciting, well done, and good for the entire family. This is a classic film.  You will love the Scarecrow's laugh. You just got to see it. By the way, the books on Dr. Syn are good reading.
