David Garrison as Steve Rhoades left the series at the end of 1989 to go back to New York for a broadway show(he commuted from NY to California to do this series). Garrison reprised his character in later episodes from later seasons. Highlights from this season include,Steve and his wife Marcy(Amanda Bearse) mourning the loss of Marcy's aunt(the Rhoadeses bring the aunt's ashes to the Bundy household.) It was Labor Day and at the Bundy household,Peggy(Katey Sagal),Kelly(Christina Applegate),Bud(David Faustino),and Al(Ed O'Neill) have a picnic in their backyard with the Rhoadeses. The burgers and franks that Al grilled tasted great thanks to the ashes from Marcy's aunt's urn that were placed inside the grill! Marcy even loved Al's cooking! Bud swooning over a beautiful foreign exchange student(Milla Jovovich before she became famous). Kelly appearing in a heavy metal video(she was at this time a vixen-like beauty). Steve even lost his job as an accountant after he gave a bad loan to Al for one of Al's get-rich-quick schemes. Marcy,also an accountant,loaned the Bundy's $50 grand to repay to Steve's bank. Marcy was demoted to drive-thru teller. Also,Marcy coming to the Bundy household to announce that Steve has left her(in the opening montage of this episode,Garrison no longer appears including the following episodes). This is the two-part episode where Marcy and Peggy travel to Las Vegas and later,Al,Bud and Kelly go there also. Al was even in a wrestling match and lost. Peggy won a trophy for bowling a perfect 300 score. Peggy discovers why she never graduated from Polk High school,the same school Kelly and Bud attend. She failed home economics her senior year. So she and Kelly graduated together. Bud even gets a chance to score with the newly divorced Marcy. Also,the Bundy's have a garage sale. It was during this season,I got into MWC which aired Sunday nights on Fox. It was even a major hit when it premiered on April 5,1987. Marcy didn't stay single for long,when she got a second husband who stuck with her through the 1997 cancellation. Also,Bud got rid of the mullet he sported during the 1988-89 season.",5,Love & Marriage 4,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,2212,"['Here', 'are', 'episodes', 'aired', 'September', '1989', 'May', '1990', 'David', 'Garrison', 'Steve', 'Rhoades', 'left', 'series', 'end', '1989', 'go', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'broadway', 'show', 'commuted', 'NY', 'California', 'do', 'series', 'Garrison', 'reprised', 'character', 'later', 'episodes', 'later', 'seasons', 'Highlights', 'season', 'include', 'Steve', 'wife', 'Marcy', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'mourning', 'loss', 'Marcy', 'aunt', 'Rhoadeses', 'bring', 'aunt', 'ashes', 'Bundy', 'household', 'was', 'Labor', 'Day', 'Bundy', 'household', 'Peggy', 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'Kelly', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Bud', 'David', 'Faustino', 'Al', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'have', 'picnic', 'backyard', 'Rhoadeses', 'burgers', 'franks', 'Al', 'grilled', 'tasted', 'great', 'thanks', 'ashes', 'Marcy', 'aunt', 'urn', 'were', 'placed', 'grill', 'Marcy', 'even', 'loved', 'Al', 'cooking', 'Bud', 'swooning', 'over', 'beautiful', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'became', 'famous', 'Kelly', 'appearing', 'heavy', 'metal', 'video', 'was', 'time', 'vixen-like', 'beauty', 'Steve', 'even', 'lost', 'job', 'accountant', 'gave', 'bad', 'loan', 'Al', 'one', 'Al', 'get-rich-quick', 'schemes', 'Marcy', 'also', 'accountant', 'loaned', 'Bundy', '50', 'grand', 'repay', 'Steve', 'bank', 'Marcy', 'was', 'demoted', 'drive-thru', 'teller', 'Also', 'Marcy', 'coming', 'Bundy', 'household', 'announce', 'Steve', 'left', 'opening', 'montage', 'episode', 'Garrison', 'no', 'longer', 'including', 'following', 'episodes', 'two-part', 'episode', 'where', 'Marcy', 'Peggy', 'travel', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'later', 'Al', 'Bud', 'Kelly', 'go', 'there', 'also', 'Al', 'was', 'even', 'wrestling', 'match', 'lost', 'Peggy', 'won', 'trophy', 'bowling', 'perfect', '300', 'score', 'Peggy', 'why', 'never', 'graduated', 'Polk', 'High', 'school', 'same', 'school', 'Kelly', 'Bud', 'attend', 'failed', 'home', 'economics', 'senior', 'year', 'Kelly', 'graduated', 'together', 'Bud', 'even', 'chance', 'score', 'newly', 'divorced', 'Marcy', 'Also', 'Bundy', 'have', 'garage', 'sale', 'was', 'season', 'got', 'MWC', 'aired', 'Sunday', 'nights', 'Fox', 'was', 'even', 'major', 'hit', 'when', 'premiered', 'April', '5,1987', 'Marcy', 'did', ""n't"", 'stay', 'single', 'long', 'when', 'got', 'second', 'husband', 'who', 'stuck', '1997', 'cancellation', 'Also', 'Bud', 'got', 'rid', 'mullet', 'sported', '1988-89', 'season']",N/A
916822,A33UCQJ1QHU8B,B0009YCLBS,Andy Radke,"[12, 13]","I must begin by saying that I am a huge fan of ""Married...With Children"".  I watched it religiously throughout its original broadcast run, and rarely ever missed it when it aired in syndication.  I loved the show so much that back in the day I had dozens of VHS tapes filled with episodes.Now I was literally ecstatic a couple of years ago when Columbia/Tri-Star (now Sony Home Entertainment) released the first season on DVD.  My legs couldn't carry me to the video store quickly enough.  :)  Needless to say, I own the first three seasons of the show, and have every intention of picking up the fourth.Now judging by the title of this review, you're probably thinking this is yet another gripe about the replaced theme song.  Well, it's not.  Although to me, ""Love & Marriage"" is synonymous with the show, it never bothered me for a moment that it was replaced.  The fact is, the rights holders demanded way too much money.Anyway, that's neither here nor there.  What I want to touch base on are the episodes themselves.  I have it on extremely good authority that 7 of the episodes contained within this set are SYNDICATED cuts.  In other words, these are not the versions which were broadcasted on FOX originally.  These versions are at least a minute shorter than the rest, whereas various footage was cut.  For those who still don't understand, these are the versions you see 5 days a week on various networks.  The cut footage makes way for more commercials.  In other words, these are the versions that were used.What you will see now is a list of the run times for each episode on the set.  Note, the episodes than run under 23 minutes.  These are the syndicated episodes of which I speak:23:10, 22:33, 22:20, 23:08, 23:08, 23:09, 23:10, 23:10, 23:09, 22:31, 23:10, 23:09, 23:10, 23:11, 22:34, 22:32, 23:11, 23:09, 23:08, 22:31, 22:35, 22:08, 23:08Now, this will not deter me from purchasing this set.  Although a bit disheartening, it is only 7 out of the 23 episoes which are syndicated cuts.  Certain shows recently released such as ""The Cosby Show"", ""Roseanne"" and ""ALF"" contain nothing BUT syndicated episodes.I'm not one to nitpick, but I felt the general public should know EXACTLY what they're buying.  But, in this reviewer's opinion, it will indeed be a great set nonetheless.We have the infamous ""It's a Bundyful Life"" the 2-part episode guest starring the late, great Sam Kinison.  ""Hot Off the Grill"" where Al barbecus using Marcy's dead Aunt's ashes.  Then there's ""Rain Girl"" where Kelly becomes the station's hot new meteorologist.  Let's not forget that Buck finally speaks this season.  Also notable is David Garrison (Steve Rhodes) who becomes a recurring character as opposed to main cast member.  Definitely a great season all around.Despite the syndicated cuts, it still sounds like a great set all around.",4,Complete?

However, I've got to hand it to them, they managed to figure out a way to make us hate them even more... Syndicated episodes! Seven syndicated episodes that have been edited down and they include;0402 - Dead Men Don't Do Aerobics0403 - Buck Saves the Day0410 - At the Zoo0414 - Rock and Roll Girl0416 - You Gotta Know when to Hold 'Em, Part 10421 - Peggy Made a Little Lamb0419 - Rain Girl &lt;- This episode is available uncut in on another DVD set.Now Sony's excuse states that the uncut prints didn't have enough audio tracks to edit the theme so they had to go back to their syndicated episodes. But come on... It's 2005, how hard can it be just to slap some new music over the theme without changing the episode? Couldn't Sony have just used the intro and closing theme footage from the syndicated episodes and slap them on the uncut prints? What kind of operation are they running over at Sony? Someone's being lazy...As for the episodes themselves, they're great. Five stars all the way. The series had already established themselves by season three and in this season the show goes off in an even more goofy tangent. Some highlights of the season concern Marcy's dead aunt's ashes, Al's shoe hotline, and Steve's stunt at a zoo. There's cameos by Milla Jovovich, Tiffani-Amber Thiessen and an awesome appearance by the late, great Sam Kinison. So now I'm just left wondering, how will Sony top themselves for Season Five?

Hayes""","[5, 34]","The first three seasons were blissful on this show, but I began to notice one show in the third season that was showing cracks in the show. That episode was where Marcy, Peg, and Kelly went fishing with Steve, Al, and Bud, and all wound up having thier period at the same time. However, here it would start going downhill. After the season premire with the Labor Day cookout it got to the point where I knew that things were going to go pfft. I know the only other show on this season worth watching was where Steve left Marcy. The worst episodes were a tie between the rock video with the Gutter Cats, and when Peg and Marcy take the kids, and go to Vegas, and blow Al's money, and in order to have money to live off of Al has to fight the G.L.O.W. girls of wrestling. I found that rather degrading. I don't say this because I wanted to see more of Al degrading Peg and Marcy, but why does there have to be degrading anyway? I feel that it's a personal choice, and not a map to have your own way otherwise none of us would be married. This was a emasculated season where Al lost his manhood completely, and the women filled it with thier own selfish desires to get what they wanted, and screw Al. There was another episode that is worth mentioning as the episode that Peg is worried that Al's cheating on her. In the scene in the beauty salon one of the women screams out ""Hey Everyone, Al's cheating on Peggy."", and then she goes back to business as usual, but don't be decieved she wet herself with sexual desire as gossip is about as good as sex. I see that in people including myself, and when you're not getting any sex then gossip is about as good as a dildo. I just saw a show without hardly any morals lose them altogether in this season. I more or less stopped watching this religiously during this season as I began to prepare this in my head that I don't want this in marriage.",1,I began to notice a pattern here,1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,1889,"['first', 'three', 'seasons', 'were', 'blissful', 'show', 'began', 'notice', 'one', 'show', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'showing', 'cracks', 'show', 'episode', 'was', 'where', 'Marcy', 'Peg', 'Kelly', 'went', 'fishing', 'Steve', 'Al', 'Bud', 'wound', 'up', 'having', 'thier', 'period', 'same', 'time', 'However', 'here', 'would', 'start', 'going', 'downhill', 'season', 'premire', 'Labor', 'Day', 'cookout', 'got', 'point', 'where', 'knew', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'pfft', 'know', 'only', 'other', 'show', 'season', 'watching', 'was', 'where', 'Steve', 'left', 'Marcy', 'worst', 'episodes', 'were', 'tie', 'rock', 'video', 'Gutter', 'Cats', 'when', 'Peg', 'Marcy', 'take', 'kids', 'go', 'Vegas', 'blow', 'Al', 'money', 'order', 'have', 'money', 'live', 'Al', 'fight', 'G.L.O.W', 'girls', 'wrestling', 'found', 'rather', 'degrading', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'Al', 'degrading', 'Peg', 'Marcy', 'why', 'there', 'have', 'be', 'degrading', 'anyway', 'feel', 'personal', 'choice', 'not', 'map', 'have', 'own', 'way', 'none', 'would', 'be', 'married', 'was', 'emasculated', 'season', 'where', 'Al', 'lost', 'manhood', 'completely', 'women', 'filled', 'thier', 'own', 'selfish', 'desires', 'get', 'what', 'wanted', 'screw', 'Al', 'was', 'episode', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'episode', 'Peg', 'worried', 'Al', 'cheating', 'scene', 'beauty', 'salon', 'one', 'women', 'screams', 'out', 'Hey', 'Everyone', 'Al', 'cheating', 'Peggy', 'then', 'back', 'business', 'usual', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'decieved', 'wet', 'sexual', 'desire', 'gossip', 'as', 'good', 'sex', 'see', 'people', 'including', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'getting', 'sex', 'then', 'gossip', 'as', 'good', 'dildo', 'just', 'saw', 'show', 'hardly', 'morals', 'lose', 'altogether', 'season', 'more', 'less', 'stopped', 'watching', 'religiously', 'season', 'began', 'prepare', 'head', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'marriage']",N/A

916833,AOZERN8GICKDD,B0009YCLBS,ERK,"[14, 14]","Ah yes, now we're finally getting to the episodes where Married With Children became hilarious.  That's not to say that the first three seasons weren't, but it was the fourth season that the show went from great to exceptional.  Every episode in this season is a classic, like the episode where Al starts his own shoe hotline, or the one where he tries to buy a new car, but fails when he finds out Peggy stole most of the money he had been hiding.  In my mind, this season is truly some of the all-time best that TV has ever had to offer.The problem lies in the actual DVD releases.  As I'm sure most of you know, there are seven syndicated episodes found in this boxset.  While it may not be the end of the world to miss a minute or so of those episodes, it definitely feels like the people involved in this were too lazy to do the necessary work to get the full versions of these seven episodes.  They offered an explanation to the problem, but I honestly feel that they were being lazy and/or cheap.  Plus the original theme music is once again missing.  I usually fast foward through it anyway, but the new theme music leaves much to be desired.  To top it all off, there is literally no bonus features on this set.I can only hope that all future box sets will include ALL uncut episodes, and that one day they will re-release this boxset with the 7 episodes fixed and totally uncut.  It's only fair to the show and to the fans.  I also hope that they work on getting the original Frank Sinatra theme music back, but this isn't as important.  All in all, I'm thrilled that Married With Children is finally available on DVD, but I really hope that the studios put more time and effort into these boxsets in the future.  I'm sure all the fans can agree that the show is worth the extra work.",4,"Great season, but the DVDs could have been better",1132099200,"11 16, 2005",2005,1794,"['Ah', 'yes', 'now', ""'re"", 'finally', 'getting', 'episodes', 'where', 'Married', 'Children', 'became', 'hilarious', 'not', 'say', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'were', ""n't"", 'was', 'fourth', 'season', 'show', 'went', 'great', 'exceptional', 'episode', 'season', 'classic', 'episode', 'where', 'Al', 'own', 'shoe', 'hotline', 'one', 'where', 'buy', 'new', 'car', 'when', 'out', 'Peggy', 'most', 'money', 'had', 'been', 'hiding', 'mind', 'season', 'truly', 'all-time', 'best', 'TV', 'ever', 'had', 'offer.The', 'problem', 'actual', 'DVD', 'releases', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'know', 'are', 'seven', 'syndicated', 'episodes', 'found', 'boxset', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'end', 'world', 'miss', 'minute', 'so', 'episodes', 'definitely', 'people', 'involved', 'were', 'too', 'lazy', 'do', 'necessary', 'work', 'get', 'full', 'versions', 'seven', 'episodes', 'offered', 'explanation', 'problem', 'honestly', 'feel', 'were', 'being', 'lazy', 'and/or', 'cheap', 'original', 'theme', 'music', 'once', 'again', 'missing', 'usually', 'fast', 'foward', 'anyway', 'new', 'theme', 'music', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'top', 'off', 'literally', 'bonus', 'set.I', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'future', 'box', 'sets', 'will', 'include', 'ALL', 'uncut', 'episodes', 'one', 'day', 'will', 're-release', 'boxset', '7', 'episodes', 'fixed', 'totally', 'uncut', 'only', 'fair', 'show', 'fans', 'also', 'hope', 'work', 'getting', 'original', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'theme', 'music', 'back', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'Married', 'Children', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'really', 'hope', 'studios', 'put', 'more', 'time', 'effort', 'boxsets', 'future', ""'m"", 'sure', 'fans', 'can', 'agree', 'show', 'extra', 'work']",N/A

The set is packaged in an attractive collectors box and contains all 23 episodes of the fourth season uncut. The show follows the misadventures of the Bundy family who are the picture of dysfunction. Family patriarch Al (Ed O'Neil) toils away in a low paying shoe store while his wife Peggy (Katey Sagal), loafs on the couch watching television and spending Al's money. Peggy will not work or do any household work such as cleaning, shopping, and cooking, which often forces Al to take extreme measure to get by. Add to this mix the scheming Bundy children Bud (David Faustino) and Kelly (Christina Applegate), the annoying neighbors the Rhodes, (David Garrison and Amanda Bearse), and you get a recipe for laughs as everyday situations spiral out of control in true Bundy fashion. Highlights of the season include the episodes ""Hot off the Grill"", ""It's a Bundyful Life"", ""A Taxing Problem"" and many, many moreThe show really hit it's stride this season as there is not one unfunny episode in the bunch. After years of Al's suffering, it rarely gets old watching him get in and out of one outrageous situation after another. .While the series was very controversial during its 11-season run, it produced many laughs and has earned a place in TV history. The bawdy and irreverent tone of the show changed the face of TV forever and always left you laughing week in and week out.

916839,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,B0009YCLBS,M. Fields,"[2, 4]","The bottom line:  Married with Children is probably the funniest show to hit the airwaves.  I say that being a diehard All in the Family fan.  Nothing on air was funnier until the Bundy's invaded our t.v. sets.  Both shows are very funny but in very different ways so AITF can still hold onto its crown.MWC is irreverent, lewd, crude, disgusting, and piggish.  That's why we love it.  There are no socially redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Well maybe just one.  They are all miserable but they stay together as a family.  If you want comedy with a few heartwarming, touching, fuzzy moments, go someplace else 'cause you ain't gonna get em here!  And by the way, the reccurring theme of hating the French is very funny.I can't think of a more pathetic family of losers.  The wife is a lazy, t.v. watching couch potato, the husband sells womens shoes, never showers and reads magazines called Biguns, the son is a skirt chasing, never gets the girl, sneak thief, and the daughter is a dumb blonde, sex pot, with the morals of an alley cat.  There's an entire show dedicated to Al's love of a toilet!  Talk about madness.  Also for good measure there are the goofy, annoying neighbors called the Jeffersons and then the Darcys along with a goofball set of Al's loser friends who are as bad off as he is.  They formed a group called NOMAM.  It's a woman haters club comprised of men who can't even get woman in the first place.  The guys that are married are trying to get rid of their wives so they can get prettier ones.  It never works.I can't begin to describe all the zany episodes.  You'll have to see them for yourself.  One of the funniest though is Al's suicidal Christmas.  That right, it's a Wonderful Life only it's Al Bundy's and it stinks.  Sam Kennison portays an angel who comes to help Al see why he should want to live only Al finds that his family would be much happier if he'd never been born.

I'm a hardcore fan with No Ma'am and Property of Polk High t-shirts and a framed Christina Applegate poster from 1990. I love this show and that is why I am so appalled at how seven of the episodes in this set (including the Christmas classic It's a Bundyful Life) are cut episodes, aka syndicated cut shows!SHAME ON SONY!I am outraged that this set claims to be the complete fourth season when it is edited. Edited and complete are f**king antonyms!!!! This is flagrant false advertising!Sure, it's good that the set didn't get the royal flush job that ROSEANNE did, a set that contains nothing but syndication butchered episodes, but nonetheless this is a let down. The other MWC sets, though seriously lacking in special features, at least contained the complete seasons (minus the opening theme on set three).  Even the insipid little ""Most Outrageous Episodes"" discs contained uncut episodes, some of which re-appear on the season four set in cut form. What the heck is that?!?!?!It's been explained that since Sony can no longer afford/are to cheap to afford to the rights to the ""Love and Marriage"" song, they've had to dig deep to search for various audio tracks, including dialouge tracks from the originals that were lost. They did, however, have the cut reruns tracks, so they used them. Rather than piece together a mix with new music, they just left the scenes out. They didn't even include them as rough deleted scenes in a bonus section. Well this is a stretch for me. How come the episode ""Raingirl"" is in uncut form on the ""Most Outrageous"" disc two but is cut on the season set? And ""Love and Marriage"" isn't playing in the course of the episode either, so that isn't the problem. Also, FOX aired the uncut versions of ""It's a Bundyful Life part I and II"" around Christmas of 2003. So apparently the tracks were not ""lost"" a year and a half ago. Sounds to me like Sony is making bad excuses for a job poorly done.Bottomline is: this is bull!While the set is still worth getting because this is likely the best season the show ever had, I am sickened by this current trend of murdering classic shows like this and cheapening the whole idea of what DVD entertainment is about. If things don't change DVD will go back to the boring format of featureless, frilless blah which was VHS.To add injury to insult, the discs are also of poor quality, much poorer than the other sets, and even have digital skips, little lines that appear and sudden, though slight, blotches. These are very light smudges in the image, but they are there, and this is shameful.Sony needs to redem themselves with the release of season five, otherwise I'm done buying these sets, and anything else from sony entertianment, as any self-respecting consumer would be.",2,"Excellent Show, Horrible Rip-Off DVD set",1125360000,"08 30, 2005",2005,2812,"['love', 'show', 'more', 'most', 'people', 'should', 'love', 'show', ""'m"", 'hardcore', 'fan', ""Ma'am"", 'Property', 'Polk', 'High', 't-shirts', 'framed', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'poster', '1990', 'love', 'show', 'why', 'am', 'so', 'appalled', 'how', 'seven', 'episodes', 'set', 'including', 'Christmas', 'Bundyful', 'Life', 'are', 'cut', 'episodes', 'aka', 'syndicated', 'cut', 'SHAME', 'ON', 'SONY', 'am', 'outraged', 'set', 'be', 'complete', 'fourth', 'season', 'when', 'edited', 'Edited', 'complete', 'are', 'f**king', 'antonyms', 'flagrant', 'false', 'advertising', 'Sure', 'good', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'royal', 'flush', 'job', 'ROSEANNE', 'did', 'set', 'nothing', 'syndication', 'butchered', 'episodes', 'nonetheless', 'let', 'down', 'other', 'MWC', 'sets', 'though', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'special', 'features', 'least', 'contained', 'complete', 'seasons', 'opening', 'theme', 'set', 'three', 'Even', 'insipid', 'little', 'Most', 'Outrageous', 'Episodes', 'discs', 'contained', 'uncut', 'episodes', 're-appear', 'season', 'four', 'set', 'cut', 'form', 'What', 'heck', 'been', 'explained', 'Sony', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'afford/are', 'cheap', 'afford', 'rights', 'Love', 'Marriage', 'song', ""'ve"", 'had', 'dig', 'deep', 'search', 'various', 'audio', 'tracks', 'including', 'dialouge', 'tracks', 'originals', 'were', 'lost', 'did', 'however', 'have', 'cut', 'reruns', 'tracks', 'used', 'Rather', 'piece', 'together', 'mix', 'new', 'music', 'just', 'left', 'scenes', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'include', 'rough', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bonus', 'section', 'Well', 'stretch', 'How', 'come', 'episode', 'Raingirl', 'uncut', 'form', 'Most', 'Outrageous', 'disc', 'two', 'cut', 'season', 'set', 'Love', 'Marriage', ""n't"", 'playing', 'course', 'episode', ""n't"", 'problem', 'Also', 'FOX', 'aired', 'uncut', 'versions', 'Bundyful', 'Life', 'part', 'II', 'Christmas', '2003', 'So', 'apparently', 'tracks', 'were', 'not', 'lost', 'year', 'half', 'ago', 'Sony', 'making', 'bad', 'excuses', 'job', 'poorly', 'done.Bottomline', 'bull', 'set', 'still', 'worth', 'getting', 'likely', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'ever', 'had', 'am', 'sickened', 'current', 'trend', 'murdering', 'classic', 'shows', 'cheapening', 'whole', 'idea', 'what', 'DVD', 'entertainment', 'about', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'DVD', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'boring', 'format', 'featureless', 'frilless', 'blah', 'was', 'VHS.To', 'add', 'injury', 'insult', 'discs', 'are', 'also', 'poor', 'quality', 'much', 'poorer', 'other', 'sets', 'even', 'have', 'digital', 'skips', 'little', 'lines', 'appear', 'sudden', 'though', 'slight', 'blotches', 'are', 'very', 'light', 'smudges', 'image', 'are', 'there', 'shameful.Sony', 'needs', 'redem', 'release', 'season', 'five', 'otherwise', ""'m"", 'done', 'buying', 'sets', 'anything', 'else', 'sony', 'entertianment', 'self-respecting', 'consumer', 'would', 'be']",N/A

916850,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B0009YCLBS,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[9, 16]","So, they replaced the opening theme with a different instrumental theme.  Is it really so terrible?  It could have been worse!  They could have just have you watch the opening and closing parts totally silent.  No music at all.  Would you rather have that instead?  You really don't know the struggles that these companies go through today to get the royalties to re-release borrowed recordings.  What if they did manage to pay the price to get Frank Sinatra's ""Love and Marriage"" for the DVD set.  We may have had to pay an increase to maybe $50 or $60 for the DVD set, just to get that one song!!! Paying royalties is not cheap!When George Lucas made ""American Graffiti"" back in 1973. The soundtrack of the music was all songs from the 1950's and 1960's.  Back then, he only had to pay about $500 for the royalties of each song.  Today, movie makers may have to pay nearly $100,000 or more for each song, and add it to a soundtrack that will only be sold for a couple of years, and then that soundtrack will go ""out of print"", because the contract for the royalties of the songs will be ended.  More money and more restrictions.  Obtaining royalties is a real challenge today because everybody that owns something that somebody else wants, are GREEDY AS HELL!I know that this was a long-winded explanation, but you whiners need to understand why Sony had to do this.  And it didn't begin with Sony either.  Married...with Children: Season Three had this newly replaced music that Columbia Tristar had to use.  Sony only inherited it!Any effort to keep the cost down while still delivering a quality product, is okay with me.Now, about Married...with Children: Season Four.  Seasons Three and Four are definately my favorite era for Married...with Children.  Right away, season four begins with the Labor Day Bar-B-Que episode.  This is Peggy being all dirty, sweaty, and apparently submissive to Al's sexual yearnings on his special day.  Although Kelly Bundy is every guy's favorite blonde sleeze, I'll have to admit that Peggy's trashy demeanor is such a turn on, and with each episode.  If I met someone like Peggy at a night club, I'd be all over her.And then there's the dentist episode with Traci Lords.  This is one of Married...with Children's finest episodes.  The ""Buying a new car"" episode, ""The Shoe Hotline"", etc. etc.  I could go on and on about the great episodes in this season but that's not neccessary.  You fellow MWC fans know that this season is just great and already had us watching the show religiously in its day.  Plus this is the season where (unfortunately) we lose Steve Rhoades.Katey Sagal (Peg Bundy) called the Bundy's a ""white trash"" family.  I'd rather just call them a ""dysfunctional"" family.  We already have other shows that are best described as TRUE ""white trash"" TV.Roseanne, Reba, King of the Hill, and even Grace Under Fire, is all basically white trash TV for white trash people to relate to.  To me, those kinds of shows are rather discouraging to watch.  Low life families with real low life problems, and trying to make it funny, too.  People who are considerably below typical middle class, making a comedy out of all the negative ""rites of passage"" for teenagers growing up, is actually depressing to watch. Watching shows like them seem to work well watching back-to-back with maybe The Jerry Springer Show.  That's typical daytime entertainment for the mobile home park dwellers, and the jobless.Married...with Children is totally unrealistic family behavior so you know that it's just nonsense made for comedy only.  No lessons to be learned here or incidents of true negative reality rubbed in our faces.  Well...anyway,I'm kinda looking forward to Married...with Children: Season Five but, I know it won't be long before we get to the seasons where the show starts the decline of its appeal for me.  I really enjoyed Steve Rhoades character.  He offered a more serious demeanor to create contradiction to Al's character.  I believe it is at Season Five where Marcy ends up being married to Jefferson Darcy.  This guy was more of an idiot so the contradiction and any confrontation between Jefferson and Al just wasn't the same.  Sure, there was great stuff, but, the humorous impact of the whole show was diminishing every year as Jefferson Darcy was on the show.  However, it's not Jefferson's fault.  It's the writers.  The last few years of the show, barely kept my interest.  Each season was as about as great as each new release of the ""Police Academy"" movies.  Overly predictable, and just getting dumber and dumber every year.But, bring 'em on!  Married...with Children still has alot of episode's that I'm looking forward to owning soon.The new music doesn't bother me, and if there were any deleted scenes, I don't recognize them.

It just goes to show how little care Fox put into assembling this collection. Let the Sinatra people stew - I have been pissed at them since season 3. I agree with the other post, it's not really Fox's fault that we lost Frank's song to pure greed.For the record, season 4 of MWC is an awesome season, 5 stars all the way, but I rated this item 4 stars because of the use of 7 syndicated (edited) episodes and the new theme. I don't find the theme to be a big problem, but it does detract from the overall 'archival' quality that I want (and deserve) from a DVD collection of TV episodes. I will not buy season 5 if syndicated episodes are used.The packaging is quite acceptable in my opinion. The sets match and the discs pop off of their spindles perfectly every time.Also, I have always thought the MWC sets had pretty well designed menus.",4,Original theme at the end of 'Buck Saves The Day',1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2005,952,"['just', 'had', 'let', 'people', 'know', 'found', ""'original"", 'theme', 'music', 'end', ""'Buck"", 'Saves', 'Day', 'Ha', 'just', 'show', 'how', 'little', 'care', 'Fox', 'put', 'assembling', 'collection', 'Let', 'Sinatra', 'people', 'stew', 'have', 'been', 'pissed', 'season', '3', 'agree', 'other', 'post', 'not', 'really', 'Fox', 'fault', 'lost', 'Frank', 'song', 'pure', 'greed.For', 'record', 'season', '4', 'MWC', 'awesome', 'season', '5', 'stars', 'way', 'rated', 'item', '4', 'stars', 'use', '7', 'syndicated', 'edited', 'episodes', 'new', 'theme', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'theme', 'be', 'big', 'problem', 'detract', 'overall', ""'archival"", 'quality', 'want', 'deserve', 'DVD', 'collection', 'TV', 'episodes', 'will', 'not', 'buy', 'season', '5', 'syndicated', 'episodes', 'are', 'used.The', 'packaging', 'quite', 'acceptable', 'opinion', 'sets', 'match', 'discs', 'pop', 'spindles', 'perfectly', 'time.Also', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'MWC', 'sets', 'had', 'pretty', 'well', 'designed', 'menus']",N/A
