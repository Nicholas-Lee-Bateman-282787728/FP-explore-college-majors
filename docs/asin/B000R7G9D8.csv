Stubborn, unforgiving old man dies and leaves his immense Montana ranch to his three daughters, all from different Mothers. As per the stipulations of his last will and testament the three women must live together on the ranch for one year in order to gain their inheritance. If anyone of them leave the land and fortune will be given to charity leaving each of them with one hundred dollars each.Critique: I'm sure the first thing that comes to mind is ""chick flick"" right? Well it certainly begins that way but a darker storyline slowly begins to develop when horses, dogs and eventually people begin to show up dead all all neatly cut up by an apparently unknown intruder.'Montana Sky' is a fairly enjoyable film that is complimented by some beautiful rugged Montana scenary and three attractive women trying to work out there differences and bitter memories of their past.

They don't know each other before hand, but they all grow to love the idea and live happily ever after.The story line for Montana Sky seems almost irrelevant watching this film.  Those who are hardcore fans of Nora Roberts might be satisfied when any of her stories are made into movies.  While I will admit that this movie was fun to watch (hence the 2 stars), it's mostly fun for the wrong reasons.The story is based on Nora Roberts novel, but the teleplay was written by April Smith.  Every cliche' in the book is used in this movie.  The people are so country, the ranch feels more Texas than Montana.  The girl from LA is called ""Hollywood,"" and she wears revealing outfits even when doing farm work.  The sister from Virginia is the stereotypical frail escapee of an abusive marriage.  John Corbett is the traditional eye-candy whose character is only there to suck-in the target market of 40 year old women.  Farmhands named Ham, Pickles, and the like are thrown in too.  Not to mention a Native American who talks about how the ""white man always tries to make a profit off of nature.""  Are you kidding me?The film is so inaccurate it's hilarious for ANYBODY who has ever been on a real farm.  There is a scene where they need 4 people to herd about 100 cattle, even though there's supposed to be thousands on their ranch.  Ridiculous!  You don't need 4 farm hands to herd 8 dozen cattle!  I guess they thought they could use smoke and mirrors to make them look like many more.  It doesn't work.  Who has only 100 head of cattle on what is supposed to be a 24 million dollar ranch!!!So why is this movie still enjoyable?  Because I can appreciate bad movies.  It's so bad, it's good.  This is not a movie to overanalyze.  This is a guilty pleasure movie for all those who love Lifetime TV and/or Nora Roberts novels.The actors do as good of a job as possible with their trite dialogue.  The predictable story and flimsy excuses for the men and women to couple up just add to the joke.Compared to this movie, almost everything on Lifetime seems Oscar worthy.  There are good actors here, but there isn't much you can believe in this movie.  The talents of Diane Ladd, for one, are very much wasted here.  Trust me, she is not alone.You can still enjoy this.  If you can laugh at a romance novel and are a fan of ""Dallas,"" you can have fun with this movie.

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[26, 29]","""Montana sky"", based on a novel of the same title written by Nora Roberts, is an entertaining movie that even those that have not read Robert's book will like.The story begins with the funeral of Jack Mercy, a multimillionaire rancher that dies suddenly, leaving ""Mercy ranch"" to his three daughters, Willa (Ashley Williams), Tess (Charlotte Ross) and Lily (Laura Mennell). These three young women have different mothers and don't know each other, but will have to live together for a year as stipulated in Jack's will, if they don't want to lose their inheritance. Jack's interference doesn't end there: as autocratic in death as he was during his lifetime, he has left two overseers for a year, and one of them is Willa's hateful neighbour, Ben (John Corbett).Willa, the only one of the sisters that lives and works in the ranch, along with her half-brother Adam (Nathaniel Arcand), resents her sisters' presence, and the fact that she now has to deal with Ben daily. But not everything is what it looks like, and sometimes what seems like bad luck can turn out to be for the better. When a dangerous stalker threatens them, Willa, Tess and Lily will need to trust each other, and the men around them, in order to survive.Sounds interesting? Well, it is  :) Truth to be told, I was somewhat afraid to watch this film, because I didn't think such a great novel could become a movie without losing the nuances that make it so good, but Mike Robe (the director) managed to avoid making an oversimplified version of ""Montana sky"".

Three sisters who have never met each other must live together for one year to collect the inheritance (the ranch) that their late father left them.The movie does not have horrible acting, but it does not have the best acting either. The characters were not allowed to develop and the entire plot, and well, the entire movie seemed to be a bunch of little scenes trying to tell a story. This movie would have been better had it been a mini-series. Maybe then, the characters would have been better developed. But then, the movie would have been longer and I don't know if I would have watched it then. As it stands, most of the relationships that develop seem out of tune with the movie. They have no basis, no screen time, and are somewhat forced and hurried. The same goes for some events and character reactions. The characters seem to react in a way not corresponding with their development in the film.Also the movie throws in all the clich&eacute;s in the world: cowgirl, cowboy that likes cowgirl, Hollywood girl that hates farm work, wilted flower woman from abusive marriage (who I think gives the worst acting of the movie) and all the males trying to act all macho when a woman is their boss. Oh well, it's an 1:45is minutes movie. What else can you expect?The movie does have great scenery though. In conclusion, it's an ok movie to watch when you have nothing else to do, nothing else to watch and just want to pass the time watching a somewhat sappy movie. Also, the character of Lily was very annoying, poorly acted and was like a wilted flower.

Unlike other reviewers, I thought screenwriter April Smith did a great job condensing down a large, multi-character novel into a cohesive two-hourish TV movie. Actually, I prefer it to the book, which I thought was unnecessarily grisly and rambling.Like the book, it has an implausible plot (3 estranged sisters must stay on a ranch for a year in order to collect their inheritance), and yes, it's riddled with broad stereotypes (there's the tomboy cowgirl, the haunted beauty, and the Hollywood powerhouse), but it's presented in a smart, enjoyable way. The actors are all excellent--the scenes with the Hollywood sister and the non-plussed sheriff are wryly funny--and Ashley Williams' tough but loyal Willa sparks and bristles nicely against the laidback charm of John Corbett's Ben McKinnon.If you're looking for an uncomplicated cinematic escape, with gorgeous vistas, lively dialogue, and just enough mystery to keep you wondering for a while, this fits the bill perfectly.",5,Pleasant Surprise,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,1023,"['Montana', 'Sky', 'came', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'other', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'screenwriter', 'April', 'Smith', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'condensing', 'down', 'large', 'multi-character', 'novel', 'cohesive', 'two-hourish', 'TV', 'movie', 'Actually', 'prefer', 'book', 'thought', 'was', 'unnecessarily', 'grisly', 'rambling.Like', 'book', 'implausible', 'plot', '3', 'estranged', 'sisters', 'must', 'stay', 'ranch', 'year', 'order', 'collect', 'inheritance', 'yes', 'riddled', 'broad', 'stereotypes', 'tomboy', 'cowgirl', 'haunted', 'beauty', 'Hollywood', 'powerhouse', 'presented', 'smart', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'Hollywood', 'sister', 'non-plussed', 'sheriff', 'are', 'wryly', 'funny', 'Ashley', 'Williams', 'tough', 'loyal', 'Willa', 'sparks', 'bristles', 'nicely', 'laidback', 'charm', 'John', 'Corbett', 'Ben', 'McKinnon.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'uncomplicated', 'cinematic', 'escape', 'gorgeous', 'vistas', 'lively', 'dialogue', 'just', 'enough', 'mystery', 'keep', 'wondering', 'while', 'bill', 'perfectly']",N/A

Granted, it is no easy task, and it shows here.  All the violence and gore were removed for the general TV audience, so that the jeopardy and terror are all but missing.  The sex scenes (a Nora Roberts trademark) are so diminished as to be non-existant.  The result of the omissions is a bland story at best.The three sisters are played by beautiful actresses, who are not very good at their craft of creating believable characters.  Or perhaps the director is to blame.  There are no contradictions, no depth in their characters at all.  There's the rough and tumble raised on the ranch sister; the Hollywood take a meeting sunglasses sister; and the wife beater victim scared of a mouse sister.  The acting and dialogue of the men are even less competent.  They pretty much walk through their roles, as if a stetson and cowboy boots were sufficient to create character.Then there are the story changes.  One example:  in the book, ""Hollywood"" Tess becomes involved with the lawyer, Nate, but in the movie version, Tess takes up with the eye-candy sheriff and Nate somehow disappears.  I can't imagine why the film makers decided to change partners for Tess.  It will be confusing to anyone who has read the novel.  To make matters stranger, when the bosomy Tess offers herself openly to the sheriff--he demurs.  Egad.  As a man, I found that hard to imagine.The scenery of Montana (shot in Canada?) is certainly attractive, and the sisters are easy on the eye.
