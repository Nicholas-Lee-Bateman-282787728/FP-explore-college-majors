1375511,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B003Y5HWFE,DVD Verdict,"[0, 0]","Patrick Bromley, DVD Verdict --Like the majority of sitcoms in their sophomore years, The League has only gotten better in Season Two. The characters are even better developed, and the ensemble is even tighter. There's really not a weak link in the bunch, though it could be argued that Jon LaJoie's Taco exists on a different show; The League takes place in recognizable reality, but Taco doesn't live there. I recognize that's the joke of the character, but it doesn't quite work. LaJoie is not to blame. Season Two also sees the addition of Jason Mantzoukas's (Baby Mama) Rafi, a horrible human being who gets laughs every time he's on screen. Still, many of the same problems present in season one haven't yet been worked out. While writer/director/mumblecore founder Mark Duplass remains one of my favorite actors on the show, his Pete still isn't much of a character--he's just the resident smartass. At times, the episodes strain too hard to pull all of the various story threads together the way that Seinfeld used to do so well, and there's a tendency to do too many variations on the same joke as though the editors couldn't decided which one to use and instead just kept them all. But these are minor complaints, because the show is consistently funny and fun to watch.The League continues to look good in HD, with a 1.78:1/1080p transfer that's bright and bold and solid. Detail is strong throughout, skin tones look natural and the overall quality represents an improvement over season one. The DTS-HD audio track isn't called upon to do much, but handles what is required of it very well: dialogue is clear and the (brief) theme music packs a punch. Being that the whole show has kind of a low-fi charm, the Blu-ray looks and sounds good enough that it's actually overkill in some ways. Still, it's nice to view the show the best way possible, and this disc allows for precisely that.In addition to the option to view ""extended"" versions of several episodes, The League: The Complete Season Two comes with a modest but not terrible offering of bonus material. There are roughly ten minutes of deleted scenes included, which offer exactly the same kind of laughs as are present in the show and were likely just cut for time. Perhaps more enjoyable is a compilation of alternate jokes improvised by the cast (a good deal of the show is improvised), many of which are funnier than what made it in but couldn't be used because they're way too dirty. A gag reel is also amusing, once again demonstrating that watching funny people make mistakes is generally more entertaining than not-funny people, if only because they know how to build on the error. An option called ""Taco Tones"" allows for the viewer to jump right to Jon LaJoie's songs, which basically play out like music videos. They're funny enough, but always feel way too produced and out of place, especially given the way that LaJoie's character has been written; they're shoehorned in because, you know, LaJoie is known for writing funny songs. A five-minute faux commercial for Taco's notary business goes way past overstaying its welcome. Lastly, there's a bit with Paul Scheer doing a Bob Ross impression and showing how to paint a ""Kluneberg."" It has very little to do with the show, but it's a funny diversion and a chance for Scheer to be silly.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",4,Consistently funny with a fantastic ensemble,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,3352,"['Patrick', 'Bromley', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'majority', 'sitcoms', 'sophomore', 'years', 'League', 'only', 'gotten', 'better', 'Season', 'Two', 'characters', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'developed', 'ensemble', 'even', 'tighter', 'really', 'not', 'weak', 'link', 'bunch', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'Jon', 'LaJoie', 'Taco', 'different', 'show', 'League', 'place', 'recognizable', 'reality', 'Taco', ""n't"", 'live', 'there', 'recognize', 'joke', 'character', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'LaJoie', 'not', 'blame', 'Season', 'Two', 'also', 'addition', 'Jason', 'Mantzoukas', 'Baby', 'Mama', 'Rafi', 'horrible', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'time', 'screen', 'Still', 'many', 'same', 'problems', 'present', 'season', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'been', 'worked', 'out', 'writer/director/mumblecore', 'founder', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'show', 'Pete', 'still', ""n't"", 'much', 'character', 'just', 'resident', 'smartass', 'times', 'episodes', 'strain', 'too', 'hard', 'pull', 'various', 'story', 'threads', 'together', 'way', 'Seinfeld', 'used', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'tendency', 'do', 'too', 'many', 'variations', 'same', 'joke', 'editors', 'could', ""n't"", 'decided', 'one', 'use', 'instead', 'just', 'kept', 'are', 'minor', 'complaints', 'show', 'consistently', 'funny', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'League', 'look', 'good', 'HD', '1.78:1/1080p', 'transfer', 'bright', 'bold', 'solid', 'Detail', 'strong', 'skin', 'tones', 'look', 'natural', 'overall', 'quality', 'improvement', 'season', 'one', 'DTS-HD', 'audio', 'track', ""n't"", 'called', 'upon', 'do', 'much', 'what', 'required', 'very', 'well', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'brief', 'theme', 'music', 'punch', 'Being', 'whole', 'show', 'kind', 'low-fi', 'charm', 'Blu-ray', 'looks', 'good', 'enough', 'actually', 'overkill', 'ways', 'Still', 'nice', 'view', 'show', 'best', 'way', 'possible', 'disc', 'precisely', 'that.In', 'addition', 'option', 'view', 'extended', 'versions', 'several', 'episodes', 'League', 'Complete', 'Season', 'Two', 'modest', 'not', 'terrible', 'offering', 'bonus', 'material', 'are', 'roughly', 'ten', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'offer', 'exactly', 'same', 'kind', 'laughs', 'are', 'present', 'show', 'were', 'likely', 'just', 'cut', 'time', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'compilation', 'alternate', 'jokes', 'improvised', 'cast', 'good', 'deal', 'show', 'improvised', 'many', 'are', 'funnier', 'what', 'made', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'used', ""'re"", 'way', 'too', 'dirty', 'gag', 'reel', 'also', 'amusing', 'once', 'again', 'demonstrating', 'watching', 'funny', 'people', 'make', 'mistakes', 'generally', 'more', 'entertaining', 'not-funny', 'people', 'only', 'know', 'how', 'build', 'error', 'option', 'called', 'Taco', 'Tones', 'viewer', 'jump', 'right', 'Jon', 'LaJoie', 'songs', 'basically', 'play', 'out', 'music', 'videos', ""'re"", 'funny', 'enough', 'always', 'feel', 'way', 'too', 'produced', 'place', 'especially', 'given', 'way', 'LaJoie', 'character', 'been', 'written', ""'re"", 'shoehorned', 'because', 'know', 'LaJoie', 'known', 'writing', 'funny', 'songs', 'five-minute', 'faux', 'commercial', 'Taco', 'notary', 'business', 'way', 'overstaying', 'welcome', 'Lastly', 'bit', 'Paul', 'Scheer', 'doing', 'Bob', 'Ross', 'impression', 'showing', 'how', 'paint', 'Kluneberg', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'show', 'funny', 'diversion', 'chance', 'Scheer', 'be', 'silly.-Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",N/A
1375512,A2QV2L9M4TO9O0,B003Y5HWFE,GS,"[1, 2]","So I was very reluctant to watch a show based on fantasy football.  Netflix kept coming up with it as a recommended show for me every time it refreshed.  Finally one night I had nothing to do so decided to give it a shot.  All I got to say about the show is WOW.  The writers are brilliant, great character development and interactions.  Seriously one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.  It can get a little crude and raunchy at times but that's what I like.  The first season although only a mere six episodes was very well done, and left me wanting more.  Seeing as netflix had not put the 2nd season on the streaming option and their lack of bluray rentals had me opt to purchase the 2nd season.Starting from the first episode it was brilliant and everything I was expecting after the first season.  Very intelligent yet immature at the same time.  It is rare to find a show where one character doesn't stand out from the rest as a ""favorite"".
