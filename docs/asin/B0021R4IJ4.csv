Nana is much better, but I wish more music scenes were incorporated into this series.

The price dropped to about half so I bought it. I have been following the box sets for months and they always were around $30 to $50 then al the sudden the box sets dropped down to $24.99.

There it was in Japanese with English subtitles, which was fine by me! I loved the story line, the music, and the comical expressions of the characters when appropriate. I really wanted to purchase the series, but the price was just too much for me to handle. Finally, I came to realize that it would be better to get the dubbed version digitally downloaded via Amazon Instant Video than not have one at all. Since my purchase, I've watched it twice. Some of the voice inflictions are different, but that's due to the language change I'm sure.

1248828,A3H9QIZJ3KL5S3,B0021R4IJ4,"J. Reel ""rabbitnthemoon""","[10, 10]","I have been an anime fan for years, but I have to say with some regret that recent series that have been domesticated have been lacking adult/slice of life issues. I wasn't too sure about this title at first being that I had read the Paradise Kiss series that is done by the same creator as Nana and wasn't too thrilled with the series. For Nana, though, my experience has been much better. The synopsis of this series is nicely summed up in Amazon's summary, but of course doesn't really bring to focus what is so great about this story.Often, in life, we question the what ifs. This series primarily focuses on the what ifs in life, especially in the case of the two Nana's. The secondary characters are often involved with this story which gives a nice fuller picture from everyone's perspective; but of course, the main story is revolved around the two Nana's, the friendship they create, the bond that buids into something that would be considered an obessesion, and the heartache that comes with misunderstandings, jealousy and mistakes that could've been mended easily if each Nana hadn't been so self involved with their own lives.Each episode is played out almost as a ""flashback"" at the misjudgements that were made and where the wrong turns started in the two Nana's friendship. While the first batch of episodes on this set are at a slow pace, it starts the series with the character's backstory, how they meet and of course how they started on their paths to the mistakes that they eventually lead to later in the series. While the manga series is still ongoing, I do believe that it is coming to its end, and if it is going the way it is, it seems to end in some form of tradegy. Compared to its manga counterpart; the anime is quite accurate to the original storyline, and although I know what happens next in the series being that I have read all the released manga--I could definately say that I am still very much entertained with the anime version. It gives the story more visual elements of course and the music is just great!Overall, this is a great series that will have you questioning your own regrets and has a bittersweetness that will tug at your heart everytime you think of the two Nana's that were destined to meet and change each other's lives!",5,A great drama,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,2275,"['have', 'been', 'anime', 'fan', 'years', 'have', 'say', 'regret', 'recent', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'domesticated', 'have', 'been', 'lacking', 'adult/slice', 'life', 'issues', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'title', 'first', 'being', 'had', 'read', 'Paradise', 'Kiss', 'series', 'done', 'same', 'creator', 'Nana', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'thrilled', 'series', 'Nana', 'though', 'experience', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'synopsis', 'series', 'nicely', 'summed', 'up', 'Amazon', 'summary', 'course', ""n't"", 'really', 'bring', 'focus', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'story.Often', 'life', 'question', 'what', 'ifs', 'series', 'primarily', 'what', 'ifs', 'life', 'especially', 'case', 'two', 'Nana', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'involved', 'story', 'nice', 'fuller', 'picture', 'everyone', 'perspective', 'course', 'main', 'story', 'revolved', 'two', 'Nana', 'friendship', 'create', 'bond', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'obessesion', 'heartache', 'misunderstandings', 'jealousy', 'mistakes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'mended', 'easily', 'Nana', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'self', 'involved', 'own', 'lives.Each', 'episode', 'played', 'out', 'almost', 'flashback', 'misjudgements', 'were', 'made', 'where', 'wrong', 'turns', 'started', 'two', 'Nana', 'friendship', 'first', 'batch', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', 'slow', 'pace', 'series', 'character', 'backstory', 'how', 'meet', 'course', 'how', 'started', 'paths', 'mistakes', 'eventually', 'lead', 'later', 'series', 'manga', 'series', 'still', 'ongoing', 'do', 'believe', 'coming', 'end', 'going', 'way', 'end', 'form', 'tradegy', 'Compared', 'manga', 'counterpart', 'anime', 'quite', 'accurate', 'original', 'storyline', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'series', 'being', 'have', 'read', 'released', 'manga', 'could', 'definately', 'say', 'am', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'entertained', 'anime', 'version', 'story', 'more', 'visual', 'elements', 'course', 'music', 'just', 'great', 'Overall', 'great', 'series', 'will', 'have', 'questioning', 'own', 'regrets', 'bittersweetness', 'will', 'tug', 'heart', 'everytime', 'think', 'two', 'Nana', 'were', 'destined', 'meet', 'change', 'other', 'lives']",Nana 1
1248829,A3DF8QZ9V8Q10N,B0021R4IJ4,"R. Lusk ""Robbie Lusk""","[2, 2]","The anime series Nana is a romantic/drama/comedy and is 47 episodes long. The story follows two 20-year old young women, both named Nana who meet coincidentally twice, and become room mates and then best friends. Nana Osaki is a punk singer who wants to debut with her band as soon as possible to emotionally get over her ex-boyfriend, Ren Honjo. She was the lead vocalist in her band, Black Stones with Ren, and they lived together as lovers.Ren is offered a chance to debut in Tokyo as a replacement member of the popular band Trapnest. Nana chooses to stick with their old band, choosing her pride over her love for Ren.Nana Komatsu, the other Nana, is nicknamed Hachi as she is a bit of a push-over, and is like a puppy. When her friends and boyfriend leave for Tokyo, she decides to join them a year later after having saved enough money to support herself.As Nana O. persues her dream, and Nana K. tries to figure out her own life goals, things get increasingly complicated and dramatic. The drama includes love affairs, reunions and success. It gets very intense at times. Friendships are tested and life and love are the key.The animation style is identical to the manga it is based on and is very good for a 47 episode series.With the story revolving around music, there are two real-life musicians that write and sing the songs for the two bands in the series. Anna Tsuchiya writes songs for/inspired by Nana and the Black Stones. Olivia Lufkin (half japanese) writes songs for/inspired by Reira and Trapnest.These songs are used as opening and closing songs to the anime, as well as played on the episodes.Anna/Nana's songs are more punk/rock. I think they suit the character perfectly, and are very catchy. Olivia/Reira's songs are more epic, melodically beautiful and sound kind of like Evanesence. All the music in this series is awesome.I would also like to add that this series is rated MA. There are scenes of sexual situations, but nothing graphic. It's definitely more adult than other shjo out there I've seen.Nana is licensed in the states by VIZ and is available in four nicely packaged volumes. A complete series collection has not been released. It can be abit expense to get all four at once, near $200, but I found it to be worth it. As of this review date, TRSI is having a sale on all their VIZ products.Nana was streaming on VIZ in english sub only for a time, I'm not sure if it's still streaming. The DVD volumes offer an english dubbing.Check out Nana, it's a great story and I think you'll love the characters.",5,A fantastic story of life and love,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,2543,"['anime', 'series', 'Nana', 'romantic/drama/comedy', '47', 'episodes', 'long', 'story', 'two', '20-year', 'old', 'young', 'women', 'named', 'Nana', 'who', 'meet', 'coincidentally', 'twice', 'become', 'room', 'mates', 'then', 'best', 'friends', 'Nana', 'Osaki', 'punk', 'singer', 'who', 'debut', 'band', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'emotionally', 'get', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Ren', 'Honjo', 'was', 'lead', 'vocalist', 'band', 'Black', 'Stones', 'Ren', 'lived', 'together', 'lovers.Ren', 'offered', 'chance', 'debut', 'Tokyo', 'replacement', 'member', 'popular', 'band', 'Trapnest', 'Nana', 'stick', 'old', 'band', 'choosing', 'pride', 'love', 'Ren.Nana', 'Komatsu', 'other', 'Nana', 'nicknamed', 'Hachi', 'bit', 'push-over', 'puppy', 'When', 'friends', 'boyfriend', 'leave', 'Tokyo', 'join', 'year', 'later', 'having', 'saved', 'enough', 'money', 'support', 'herself.As', 'Nana', 'O.', 'dream', 'Nana', 'K.', 'figure', 'out', 'own', 'life', 'goals', 'things', 'get', 'increasingly', 'complicated', 'dramatic', 'drama', 'affairs', 'reunions', 'success', 'very', 'intense', 'times', 'Friendships', 'are', 'tested', 'life', 'love', 'are', 'key.The', 'animation', 'style', 'identical', 'manga', 'based', 'very', 'good', '47', 'episode', 'series.With', 'story', 'revolving', 'music', 'are', 'two', 'real-life', 'musicians', 'write', 'sing', 'songs', 'two', 'bands', 'series', 'Anna', 'Tsuchiya', 'songs', 'for/inspired', 'Nana', 'Black', 'Stones', 'Olivia', 'Lufkin', 'half', 'japanese', 'songs', 'for/inspired', 'Reira', 'Trapnest.These', 'songs', 'are', 'used', 'opening', 'closing', 'songs', 'anime', 'as', 'well', 'played', 'episodes.Anna/Nana', 'songs', 'are', 'more', 'punk/rock', 'think', 'suit', 'character', 'perfectly', 'are', 'very', 'catchy', 'Olivia/Reira', 'songs', 'are', 'more', 'epic', 'melodically', 'beautiful', 'sound', 'kind', 'like', 'Evanesence', 'music', 'series', 'awesome.I', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'add', 'series', 'rated', 'MA', 'are', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'situations', 'nothing', 'graphic', 'definitely', 'more', 'adult', 'other', 'shjo', 'there', ""'ve"", 'seen.Nana', 'licensed', 'states', 'VIZ', 'available', 'four', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'volumes', 'complete', 'series', 'collection', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'can', 'be', 'abit', 'expense', 'get', 'four', 'once', '200', 'found', 'be', 'worth', 'review', 'date', 'TRSI', 'having', 'sale', 'VIZ', 'products.Nana', 'was', 'streaming', 'VIZ', 'english', 'sub', 'only', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'still', 'streaming', 'DVD', 'volumes', 'offer', 'english', 'dubbing.Check', 'Nana', 'great', 'story', 'think', ""'ll"", 'love', 'characters']",Nana 1
