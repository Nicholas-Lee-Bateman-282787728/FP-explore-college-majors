815604,A1L3RWD0VD0A1P,B0001WTWII,"Cherie Priest ""Cherie Priest""","[3, 6]","The set-up, in 50 words or less: Adorable street orphans innocently assist a vampire, who then joins their cute little gang and looks out for them as they grow up. But the streets get meaner as the kids get older. Gun-fu and blood-sucking ensue.Fifteen minutes into this film, my beloved declared it, ""The greatest movie ever made. Ever. About anything."" We agreed (to my frank surprise) that we adored all the androgynous Asian guys in their ultra-mod clothes and eyeliner; we laughed out loud at the boys' antics; and we were mutually besotted with Kei -- the gosh-darned cutest vampire that ever did kick ass in the future while wearing an oversized Members Only jacket.Kei-as-resident-vampire was a flawless interpretation of ""Armand"" from Interview with the Vampire. Oh God, but he was perfect. The guy looks fifteen, he's heroin-chic skinny, angst-ridden and tough-as-leather-pants when need-be. He's got style, he's got panache ... and he's got Sho, his (you're-not-fooling-anyone, you know) ""friend"" with a passion for vinyl, braids and eye make-up.And so the movie romps along for the first 35 minutes or so -- guns blazing, mascara running, swishy-coats swishing -- and then ... it stops. What began as a light-hearted, flashy comedy suddenly shifts into a different gear altogether. Woe ensues. Lots and lots of hearty woe. It's interesting woe; it's well-drawn woe; but it's woe, and I didn't get sucked into this movie for woe. By the end of the thing I was positively bitter about all the woe, even though it did try to end on a more or less ""up"" note. Kind of. I guess.All in all, this was a surprisingly good movie -- if psychologically jarring. The emotional WAY UP HIGH and then DOWN, DOWN, down, *crash* was disconcerting but I can't say it wasn't effective. I only wish that Moon Child could have been either one thing or the other -- a slick supernatural gun-fu flick OR a sad post-modern fable about the dreary hopelessness of life's painful, doomed progression towards death. And doom. With death. And sorrow. With a dash of WOE.Anyway, if you're game for some intriguing foreign fodder, pick it up. If you'd rather not contemplate misery before bedtime but you need some fangy Asian cheese, leave *Moon Child* on the shelf and grab *The Vampire Effect* instead.",4,"surprisingly good, if a little doom-filled",1098921600,"10 28, 2004",2004,2285,"['set-up', '50', 'words', 'less', 'Adorable', 'street', 'orphans', 'innocently', 'assist', 'vampire', 'who', 'then', 'cute', 'little', 'gang', 'out', 'grow', 'up', 'streets', 'get', 'meaner', 'kids', 'get', 'older', 'Gun-fu', 'blood-sucking', 'ensue.Fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'beloved', 'declared', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Ever', 'anything', 'agreed', 'frank', 'surprise', 'adored', 'androgynous', 'Asian', 'guys', 'ultra-mod', 'clothes', 'eyeliner', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'boys', 'antics', 'were', 'mutually', 'besotted', 'Kei', 'gosh-darned', 'cutest', 'vampire', 'ever', 'did', 'kick', 'ass', 'future', 'wearing', 'oversized', 'Members', 'Only', 'jacket.Kei-as-resident-vampire', 'was', 'flawless', 'interpretation', 'Armand', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'Oh', 'God', 'was', 'perfect', 'guy', 'fifteen', 'heroin-chic', 'skinny', 'angst-ridden', 'tough-as-leather-pants', 'when', 'need-be', 'got', 'style', 'got', 'panache', 'got', 'Sho', ""you're-not-fooling-anyone"", 'know', 'friend', 'passion', 'vinyl', 'braids', 'eye', 'make-up.And', 'movie', 'along', 'first', '35', 'minutes', 'so', 'guns', 'blazing', 'mascara', 'running', 'swishy-coats', 'swishing', 'then', 'What', 'began', 'light-hearted', 'flashy', 'comedy', 'suddenly', 'different', 'gear', 'altogether', 'Woe', 'ensues', 'Lots', 'lots', 'hearty', 'woe', 'interesting', 'woe', 'well-drawn', 'woe', 'woe', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sucked', 'movie', 'woe', 'end', 'thing', 'was', 'positively', 'bitter', 'woe', 'even', 'did', 'try', 'end', 'more', 'less', 'note', 'Kind', 'guess.All', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'movie', 'psychologically', 'jarring', 'emotional', 'WAY', 'UP', 'HIGH', 'then', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'down', '*crash*', 'was', 'disconcerting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'effective', 'only', 'wish', 'Moon', 'Child', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'thing', 'other', 'slick', 'supernatural', 'gun-fu', 'flick', 'OR', 'sad', 'post-modern', 'fable', 'dreary', 'hopelessness', 'life', 'painful', 'doomed', 'progression', 'towards', 'death', 'doom', 'death', 'sorrow', 'dash', 'WOE.Anyway', ""'re"", 'game', 'intriguing', 'foreign', 'fodder', 'pick', 'up', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'contemplate', 'misery', 'bedtime', 'need', 'fangy', 'Asian', 'cheese', 'leave', '*Moon', 'Child*', 'shelf', 'grab', '*The', 'Vampire', 'Effect*', 'instead']",Moon Child

But Gackt and Hyde just blow away all of that!  This was an astounding movie and the story of love and friendship is a good twist from the yakuza (gang) storyline.  Gackt was sooooo hot in this movie, and he's so funny too!  His facial expressions are just so cute!  And Hyde also does a wonderful job portraying the tortured vampire who doesn't know where he belongs and doesn't like who he is.  Both Gackt and Hyde played their characters so well that sometimes it seemed as if they weren't acting in a movie at all.  The diretor certainly takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride of emotions and keeps your attention the whole time!  From comedy, to action, to gun blasting excitement, to sadness,  this movie is just one you have to see!  And beleive me, it will quickly become one of your favorites!!  It's extremely sad too, I cried my eyes out until I got a headache, lol.  The ending is just perfect for this movie and leaves you wanting more.  Plus after you watch the movie, you can go buy all of Gackt's cd's and listen to what a good singer he is too!!

I, being a rather large Gackt fan and a long-time follower of LaRuKu, felt this pairing was a dream come true.  What I asked for was a sexy sci-fi vampire romp with plenty of great poses and J-Rocker action, yet what I received was a strong movie of friendship and the search for happiness.The movie starts strong and keeps on going, yet slows down near the middle when their lives start to fall apart.  Piece  by piece things crumble until the characters manage to sort true happiness from despair and find some order in their lives.I found the movie ot be a little lacking in some parts, and some of the angst seems very Malice Mizer in nature.  There's a distinct break in the movie where the plot take a major twist, and it leaves watchers wondering exactly what will happen next.

815610,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0001WTWII,Lee Armstrong,"[10, 14]","My daughter is a big fan of Japanese music; so I watched this with her.  Hyde is a major rock star with his band L'Arc-en-Ciel and solo CDs.  Gackt is a major rock star from two bands, Cain's Feel & Malice Mizer.  Wang Lee Hom is also famous, but his music isn't as favored in my household!  In this movie, they all do a good job.  Director Takahisa Zeze's 6th feature after some not released in the U.S. (""Dog Star,"" ""Rush,"" ""Hysteric"") keeps an intricate plot clear, spans a period of years in classic episodic structure, and creates a science fiction world of 2014 in a place Mallepa where Japanese refugees have gone to find work after the economic collapse of Japan.  Hyde plays Kei, a blond Japanese vampire who befriends a little boy.  The little boy grows up and is played by Gackt Camui with what is actually excellent range.  We see the young man who is wild and nonchalant and then skip forward in years where he is in charge.  Gackt makes the character transition significant and believable.  Taro Yamamoto plays their friend Toshi and won a supporting actor award at a festival.  Wang Lee Hom who has done more film (""Starlit High Noon,"" ""Lust Caution"") plays the good-looking friend who winds up on the other side of the yakuza and battles to the last bullet.  Yi-Che is his sister played by Zeny Kwok who marries Sho & later dies of a fatal illness.  I guess the wardrobe for Kei and Sho is Japanese rock star mode.  I thought it made them look effeminate, which was a particularly inappropriate choice since one of the main themes of the film is the bond between these two men.  The story doesn't indicate that this is a gay vampire or a gay protege, but the clothes make you wonder if there's something between the lines not on the screen.  Meanwhile Wang Lee Hom looks like he could have walked out of Las Vegas.  Other than costumes, Zeze combines the elements of vampires, science fiction & Japanese mafia into an entertaining film.

Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[4, 5]","Despite having a name that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball, Gackt is a bishounen, or ""beautiful boy"" with genuine acting chops.  He is a tall drink of water it is hard to tear your eyes from.The setting for Moon Child is the future.  The city is called Maleppa.  The time, place, and sets are similar to the TV series Dark Angel.  Moon Child's story centers around a group of street-tough friends, four guys and a girl, Yi-Che.  One of the guys, Kei, is a vampire.  Only Sho knows his secret.  Another is the Yi-Che's brother.  Yi-Che is shy and does not speak, but Sho (Gackt) falls hard for her nonetheless.  The guys are caught up in crime and trying to rip off other gangs.  This proves very dangerous.  Soon the group falls apart.The first half of the movie moves very fast; the second half very slow.  Regardless, the movie was better than I thought it would be.  One thing I took away is the fact that no matter how much you think they will last forever, good times with your buddies never do.Extras are really disappointing.

Second, I don't believe most of the negative reviews are fair in the sense that reviewer doesn't seem to &#34;get&#34; the movie.Plot: The plot sounds bizarre, I couldn't blame someone for being skeptical about the movie based on the bizarre genre match. Its also somewhat hard to describe given that there are two major &#34;time jumps&#34; in the movie and changing dynamics between the characters. Essentially, its about a group of friends who earn money by drugging elite gangs. One of the friends is a vampire, but not everyone knows it in the beginning. If this sounds strange, it is. But it's brought together in a beautiful way based on the theme of the movie.Theme: The major theme of this movie is change. People who say the plot is nonsensical are definitively not appreciative or aware of satire. In a period of two hours, this movie covers the heart-felt beginning of new friendships, questions of mortality and existence, the pain of change, the loss of past, sacrifice and rebirth. Not only are these themes present, they are developed in a way that makes you feel developed to the characters. Each character has a specific purpose, a role in the movie. If you remove any single character from the movie, the events wouldn't have played out in a way which covered all the aforementioned themes. Also, the movie is gushing with symbolism and satire. You may not get it all your first time around, but if you pay attention you'll want to watch it again. There are very few movies that you can watch several times throughout several points in your life and be able to feel connected to it.All in all, I'd recommend this movie to anyone who crave something more than a rudimentary plot and senseless violence.

I especially appreciate L'Arc-En-Ciel's music. Hyde definitely can perform and sing.However, this movie was a mess. It needed better story structure and editing. It really was a strange experience in the mish-mosh way of telling a vampire-human bond (with homoerotic undertones) type of tale.Hyde plays a vampire who is pretty sick of his life and has a death wish. Gackt plays a juvenile delinquent in a futuristic Asian town who, with the aid of his vampire comrade, rises in the ranks.The fight scenes have a certain over-the-top appeal.

It is not an ordinary vampire movie where the theme is more or less on the lust for the flesh. Yet, it is neither an action gun firing movie where the hero defeats vallain. In fact, many themes coexist in ""Moon Child"" - the struggle between love and hate, friendship and rivalry; the pain of growing up and growing apart; the choice of eternal life and unexpected death upon all human beings; and so many more.I think that I should state here that I often review movies based on the feelings they gave me rather than the technical things such as plot and character development. Because, after all, we watch movies to search for feelings that are hard to find in reality, not to criticize how the story is written. ""Moon Child"" gave me a very different and somewhat melancholy feeling which doesn't usually exist in the happy Amiercan moives.I didn't know too much about the cast before I watched the movie, except for Lee Hom Wong who took the role of Ah-Sun. I didn't know anything about Hyde and Gackt, which I think made me less biased in judging the movie. It wasn't until afterwards that I found out that Hyde and Gackt were actually professional singers in Japan. By the way, I think Hyde looks way much better than Gackt who often looks more like a woman than man.Nonetheless, I think Hyde and Gackt's actings were great. Lee Hom Wong, on the other hand, wasn't as good as the rest of the cast, especially when he was speaking his lines in Chinese. I don't know if it was because the most of the cast were Japanese, or something else, but Lee Hom Wong seemed to have a lot of difficulty in fluently spitting out his lines in Chinese. There always seemed to be a little awkwardness in his accent and tone, which made his acting weird.I strongly recommend this movie.

This is an action/vampire story which sounds insane and it's not dubbed for those of you who won't read subtitles.  I have to say this has actually turned into my favorite Vampire movie.  No big vampire make and Hyde does a remarkable job as Kei a vampire who was turned and then the man who turned him sat in the sun to die because he said he had seen and done everything he needed to.  Kei is haunted by what he has become also when he meet Sho (Gackt's) character who appears about 8 or 9.  Kei is shocked when Sho sees him starting to smoke when the sun hits him and drags  him to his brother and friends hideout into the shady spot.  The three young boys have just robbed a man with a briefcase full of money to me it is assummed he is some sort of bad guy with all that cash.  As you can except he chases the boys and finds one of them first Sho's brother and shoots him in the leg.  Toshi the friend has taken off another direction and the man directs Sho to get him before he kills his brother.  As he steps out of screen you here a sound his brother screams as Sho runs right back and warns him against going in saying his friend is a monster.  In fact although Kei kills/feeds off the man he does it to save the boys.  When Sho sees him with the blood on his lips and isn't frightened he asked him if he were scared and he tells him by shaking his head and smiling.This friendship as Sho and the others while Kei has to watch it happen around him is both beautiful and sad.  Hyde often is photographed in tons of make up but I have to say although he is very small probably a little over 5 feet tall and rather delicate looking he is very handsome in the nearly natural make up they did with him.  I do have to agree with others that they overdid Gackts makeup he's a handsome guy I know make up is one of his trademarks too but in the movie it was too much.  But as with Hyde Gackt put in a very wonderful performance of both at times a little funny to a wide range of emotions.I liked that this wasn't your typical vampire bite em up movie.  Kei's character only fed on people that Sho and his gang fought and killed.There are some beautiful scenes in this movie and personally I like the way they used Kei's vampire skills.  In one gun battle particularly I found it so beautiful as Hyde/Kei held onto a bad guy and did a dance as he shot.I've given away enough but just remember go into this movie with an open mind it might surprise you.  I picked it up when I read Hyde was in it for the dumb reason I loved his bands song Ready Steady Go from Full Metal Alchemist the anime.  Turns out he should be in more movies however I think he has only done 2.,5,One of my fave's,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2854,"['others', 'have', 'written', 'story', 'Moon', 'Child', 'singers', 'Hyde', 'Gackt', 'play', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'are', '3', '4', 'become', 'joined', 'group', 'friends', 'action/vampire', 'story', 'insane', 'not', 'dubbed', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'read', 'subtitles', 'have', 'say', 'actually', 'turned', 'favorite', 'Vampire', 'movie', 'big', 'vampire', 'make', 'Hyde', 'remarkable', 'job', 'Kei', 'vampire', 'who', 'was', 'turned', 'then', 'man', 'who', 'turned', 'sat', 'sun', 'die', 'said', 'had', 'seen', 'done', 'everything', 'needed', 'Kei', 'haunted', 'what', 'become', 'also', 'when', 'meet', 'Sho', 'Gackt', 'character', 'who', '8', '9', 'Kei', 'shocked', 'when', 'Sho', 'starting', 'smoke', 'when', 'sun', 'brother', 'hideout', 'shady', 'spot', 'three', 'young', 'boys', 'have', 'just', 'robbed', 'man', 'briefcase', 'full', 'money', 'assummed', 'sort', 'bad', 'guy', 'cash', 'can', 'except', 'boys', 'one', 'first', 'Sho', 'brother', 'shoots', 'leg', 'Toshi', 'friend', 'taken', 'off', 'direction', 'man', 'Sho', 'get', 'brother', 'screen', 'here', 'sound', 'brother', 'screams', 'Sho', 'right', 'back', 'going', 'saying', 'friend', 'monster', 'fact', 'Kei', 'man', 'save', 'boys', 'When', 'Sho', 'blood', 'lips', ""n't"", 'frightened', 'asked', 'were', 'scared', 'shaking', 'head', 'smiling.This', 'friendship', 'Sho', 'others', 'Kei', 'watch', 'happen', 'beautiful', 'sad', 'Hyde', 'often', 'photographed', 'tons', 'make', 'up', 'have', 'say', 'very', 'small', 'probably', 'little', '5', 'feet', 'tall', 'rather', 'delicate', 'looking', 'very', 'handsome', 'nearly', 'natural', 'make', 'up', 'did', 'do', 'have', 'agree', 'others', 'overdid', 'Gackts', 'makeup', 'handsome', 'guy', 'know', 'make', 'up', 'one', 'trademarks', 'too', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'Hyde', 'Gackt', 'put', 'very', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'times', 'little', 'funny', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions.I', 'liked', 'was', ""n't"", 'typical', 'vampire', 'bite', 'up', 'movie', 'Kei', 'character', 'only', 'fed', 'people', 'Sho', 'gang', 'fought', 'are', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'movie', 'personally', 'like', 'way', 'used', 'Kei', 'vampire', 'skills', 'one', 'gun', 'battle', 'particularly', 'found', 'so', 'beautiful', 'Hyde/Kei', 'held', 'bad', 'guy', 'did', 'dance', ""'ve"", 'given', 'away', 'enough', 'just', 'remember', 'go', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'might', 'surprise', 'picked', 'up', 'when', 'read', 'Hyde', 'was', 'dumb', 'reason', 'loved', 'bands', 'song', 'Ready', 'Steady', 'Go', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'anime', 'out', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'movies', 'however', 'think', 'only', 'done', '2']",Moon Child

Naimpally ""avid music and movie fan""","[2, 3]","Reading the blurb on the back of the DVD, I expected this to be a vampire/action flick, and while there is plenty of action, it is first and foremost a drama. I wanted to add that I had not heard of the leads before; apparently they are popular rock stars in Japan. I intend to check out their music when I have time.The plot is intriguing. The film follows the lives of several street urchins. The two boys work together to steal so that they can provide for themselves. One of them comes across a severely wounded vampire and saves his life and is rewarded by being turned into a vampire. The rest of the movie then deals with the interplay and relationships between several humans and one vampire, all of whom are friends.The vampire role is not glorified. To the contrary, the vampire considers it a curse because he has to live off the lives of others, which he loathes so much that he often does without feeding on humans for extended periods of time. He also doesn't like the idea that he will outlast his friends. But it comes in handy in their life of crime.As they grow older,a love triangle develops between the woman, whom they have known since she was a street urchin, and the two boys who are now men. We also watch as their life of crime escalates into full-scale armed robbery. The non-vampire's brother, who has a pizza store, delivers drugged pizza to the business they plan to rip-off. He always seems to mess up though, by not putting enough drugs to knock out the guards or by delivering too late. This of course provides a pre-text for some good gun battles.During the robbery of a local organized crime gang, they meet and team up with a Taiwanese kid whose out for revenge after the gang raped his sister. He then becomes part of the group of friends and we see them hanging out together as young adults and having fun at the beach in the moonlight. These ""fun years"" are important because as they grow older, the drift apart and become harder and more cynical.Eventually the Taiwanese leaves to join the local Taiwan mafia and ""be with his own people"", the non-vampire marries the woman and they have a daughter, the brother with the pizza business becomes the owner of a bar, and the vampire becomes more cynical. The relationships become more complex as they grow older and the film's real strength is in watching the complexity of the relationships evolve with the added twist that one of them is a vampire.I don't want to give away the ending but it is very poignant and the movie is full of very deep and touching scenes.

They become close friends then, because of their violent life-styles, end up throwing their lives away, and even end up pitted against each other.  The twist is that one of the main characters just happens to be a vampire.  He doesn't necessarily go hunting for blood or avoid being hunted by slayers--he's just a faster, stronger gangster who doesn't go outside on a day of lovely weather.The first half of the movie had some cool gun fights, but after that, things started to get boring.  There was no tangible driving force behind the story, and I kept wondering, ""Where is this movie going?!""  It could have instead been a story about a man who's thirsty, but never bothers to fetch himself a glass of water and therefore dies of thirst, and the plot progression would have been just the same.Watching this film felt like watching a live-action manga--the kind that *might* fare well as a comic book or animated short, but doesn't carry over well to live-action.  (I think the main factor of success for this film is the fact that there are so many girls crazy for Gackt and Hide who will buy anything they make.)If you're looking for a good gangster film, see ""A Better Tomorrow"" instead, or for a cool vampire movie, watch the first ""Blade.""",3,So-so gangster flick,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,1399,"['basically', 'just', 'shoot', 'up', 'ganster', 'film', 'slight', 'twist', 'A', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'gun', 'meet', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'then', 'violent', 'life-styles', 'end', 'up', 'throwing', 'lives', 'away', 'even', 'end', 'up', 'pitted', 'other', 'twist', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'just', 'be', 'vampire', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'go', 'hunting', 'blood', 'avoid', 'being', 'hunted', 'slayers', 'just', 'faster', 'stronger', 'gangster', 'who', ""n't"", 'go', 'outside', 'day', 'lovely', 'weather.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'had', 'cool', 'gun', 'fights', 'things', 'started', 'get', 'boring', 'was', 'tangible', 'driving', 'force', 'story', 'kept', 'wondering', 'Where', 'movie', 'going', 'could', 'have', 'instead', 'been', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'thirsty', 'never', 'bothers', 'fetch', 'glass', 'water', 'therefore', 'dies', 'thirst', 'plot', 'progression', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'same.Watching', 'film', 'felt', 'watching', 'live-action', 'manga', 'kind', 'fare', 'well', 'comic', 'book', 'animated', 'short', ""n't"", 'carry', 'over', 'well', 'live-action', 'think', 'main', 'factor', 'success', 'film', 'fact', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'girls', 'crazy', 'Gackt', 'Hide', 'who', 'will', 'buy', 'anything', 'make', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'gangster', 'film', 'see', 'A', 'Better', 'Tomorrow', 'instead', 'cool', 'vampire', 'movie', 'watch', 'first', 'Blade']",Moon Child
