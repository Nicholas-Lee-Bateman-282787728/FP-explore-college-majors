Yet, in a spasm of moral violence, the United States banned alcohol for a little more than a decade.  The laws which did so were the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution and the Volstead Act.With three separate films, and using stock footage and photos of the key participants as well as riveting historical commentary, Ken Burns traces the ""Dry"" movement from its origins in a Congregationalist sermon in the 1860's to becoming policy.

I was surprised at this statement, given the ""War on Drugs"" that has been ""fought"" for decades. Of course, no constitutional amendment is involved, but is this really different than the war on alcohol of years ago?

1421122,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B004NJC0R0,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[3, 3]","Prohibition lasted from 1920 to 1933. Ironically this period say an increase in alcohol consumption. But most importantly, it gave power and money to organized crime. Burns absolutely captures the mood of this time period.One of the best parts of this collection is that Burns and his researchers went back to many years before prohibition and followed the initial stirrings of the anti alcohol movement. He takes us to mid 1800s Kansas, Ohio, and other places where women formed groups against alcohol sales while promoting suffrage. By the end of the first disc, Prohibition is going into effect. The second disc really gets into the events of the actual years during Prohibition. Not only do we look at the most notorious gangster of them all, Al Capone a.k.a. Scarface, but we also see organized crime rings cropping up all over the country. Many were founded by ex-cops, ex-lawyers, and ex-politicians.The story is wonderfully narrated by many talented people, including Tom Hanks, Sam Waterston, John Lithgow, Samuel L Jackson, and Blythe Danner. The narration is particularly well directed and placed. Burns and co-director Lynn Novick are seasoned veterans of documentary directing (she also worked with Burns on The War). Their talents show a masterful touch. We never really get the feeling that we are being taught something, but instead are brought into the stories and times as a silent observer. When you finish the documentary, you really get a sense that you learned something but you just don't feel it was forced on you.Another great benefit of Burns' directing is that we see views from all sides of the story. We do see the reasons why Prohibition came into effect. We also see the impossibility of enforcing these laws in a non-totalitarian state. There isn't really a 'lesson'. Burns and company aren't saying ""Look how foolish this Prohibition thing was!"", but instead they are showing the causes leading up to this time and the effect the laws had on the United States, and even the US allies such as Britain.While this isn't quite the powerhouse that ""The War"" was or the epic story that Burns told in ""Lewis and Clark"", it is nonetheless a great documentary of a pivotal time in American history. Burns and Novick really do a wonderful job of bringing life to the black and white photos and grainy short film clips. It's a time in history that most Americans are passingly familiar with, but it is so interesting to actually get into the heart of the story and see all of the good and bad associated with this time.One note: I am watching the Blu-Ray edition checked out from my local library. While I am a fan of Blu-Ray in general for the clarity and the audio, I do feel that it is rather unnecessary for this documentary. Most of the old photography isn't meant to be crystal clear. I do recommend the HD version (streaming or Blu-Ray), but I feel like the story wouldn't be any less amazing in standard definition.",5,Ken Burns brings us an important piece of American history ~,1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,2945,"['Prohibition', 'lasted', '1920', '1933', 'Ironically', 'period', 'say', 'increase', 'alcohol', 'consumption', 'most', 'importantly', 'gave', 'power', 'money', 'organized', 'crime', 'Burns', 'absolutely', 'mood', 'time', 'period.One', 'best', 'parts', 'collection', 'Burns', 'researchers', 'went', 'back', 'many', 'years', 'prohibition', 'followed', 'initial', 'stirrings', 'anti', 'alcohol', 'movement', 'mid', '1800s', 'Kansas', 'Ohio', 'other', 'places', 'where', 'women', 'formed', 'groups', 'alcohol', 'sales', 'promoting', 'suffrage', 'end', 'first', 'disc', 'Prohibition', 'going', 'effect', 'second', 'disc', 'really', 'events', 'actual', 'years', 'Prohibition', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'look', 'most', 'notorious', 'gangster', 'Al', 'Capone', 'a.k.a', 'Scarface', 'also', 'see', 'organized', 'crime', 'rings', 'cropping', 'up', 'country', 'Many', 'were', 'founded', 'ex-cops', 'ex-lawyers', 'ex-politicians.The', 'story', 'wonderfully', 'narrated', 'many', 'talented', 'people', 'including', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'narration', 'particularly', 'well', 'directed', 'placed', 'Burns', 'co-director', 'Lynn', 'Novick', 'are', 'seasoned', 'veterans', 'documentary', 'directing', 'also', 'worked', 'Burns', 'War', 'talents', 'show', 'masterful', 'touch', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'being', 'taught', 'something', 'instead', 'are', 'brought', 'stories', 'times', 'silent', 'observer', 'When', 'finish', 'documentary', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'learned', 'something', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'forced', 'you.Another', 'great', 'benefit', 'Burns', 'directing', 'see', 'views', 'sides', 'story', 'do', 'see', 'reasons', 'why', 'Prohibition', 'came', 'effect', 'also', 'see', 'impossibility', 'enforcing', 'laws', 'non-totalitarian', 'state', ""n't"", 'really', ""'lesson"", 'Burns', 'company', 'are', ""n't"", 'saying', 'Look', 'how', 'foolish', 'Prohibition', 'thing', 'was', 'instead', 'are', 'showing', 'causes', 'leading', 'up', 'time', 'effect', 'laws', 'had', 'United', 'States', 'even', 'US', 'allies', 'such', 'Britain.While', ""n't"", 'quite', 'powerhouse', 'War', 'was', 'epic', 'story', 'Burns', 'told', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'nonetheless', 'great', 'documentary', 'pivotal', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'Burns', 'Novick', 'really', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'black', 'white', 'photos', 'grainy', 'short', 'film', 'clips', 'time', 'history', 'most', 'Americans', 'are', 'passingly', 'familiar', 'so', 'interesting', 'actually', 'get', 'heart', 'story', 'see', 'good', 'bad', 'associated', 'time.One', 'note', 'am', 'watching', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'checked', 'out', 'local', 'library', 'am', 'fan', 'Blu-Ray', 'general', 'clarity', 'audio', 'do', 'feel', 'rather', 'unnecessary', 'documentary', 'Most', 'old', 'photography', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'crystal', 'clear', 'do', 'recommend', 'HD', 'version', 'streaming', 'Blu-Ray', 'feel', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'less', 'amazing', 'standard', 'definition']",Ken Burns: Prohibition
1421123,ACJVGDN8G386P,B004NJC0R0,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[3, 4]","My favorite comment in this documentary is offered by Pete Hamill, American journalist, novelist and essayist, who said basically if you want people to brush their teeth, pass a law banning toothpaste. And then people will do everything they can to acquire toothpaste illegally, and they'll brush their teeth just to spite the law. The unforeseen consequence of Prohibition is that once you take away a person's right to do something that people have always done, people will feel the desire to want it much more intensely, in the same way if you deny a child all sweets, the kid will be sneaking chocolate inside his jacket sleeves. Hamill later says he doesn't drink, but he would probably take a swig in front of a government building if the law ever forbade him from doing it. Encouraging moderation is not the same as banning something completely.The other comment worth noting concerns repeal crusader Pauline Sabin who had been entrenched in republican politics prior to 1928. Republican congressmen would vote to adhere to the strictest of prohibition laws as laid out by the Volstead Act and then go to one of Sabin's parties demanding a drink. She concluded that the United States had become ""a Nation of Hypocrites"", which is the title of the third installment of Burn's documentary. Sabin becomes an unlikely hero who would sway the country against Prohibition and the eventual repeal of the 18th Amendment of the Constitution, the only amendment so dignified. Ironically, Daniel Okrent points out that today alcohol is somewhat harder to come by than during Prohibition because of liquor laws, underage drinking laws, etc. When alcohol was strictly forbidden, there was nothing in place to regulate it, except for raids on speakeasies and private distilleries.Based in part on Daniel Okrent's ""Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition"", Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's ""Prohibition"" is a thoroughly entertaining, simultaneously humorous and ""sobering"" look at one of the strangest episodes in American legal history. The documentary is in three parts, the first chronicling the birth of the temperance movement which began in the 1820's almost a century before the ratification of the 18th Amendment. No question that alcohol was a problem for some people, mostly among the rural poor, but the temperance movement decided alcohol itself was the problem and vowed its eradication by the late 19th century. The first part ends with the ratification of the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution prohibiting not only the sale but importation of alcohol. Part two concerns the passage of the Volstead Act designed to enforce the amendment, and the immediate consequences of trying to stop people from drinking, and the antithetical results, such as lawlessness and bribery. The third and most sobering of the episodes chronicles many of the unintended consequences, such as the violence erupting in Chicago and the night club craze. The documentary ends with the movement for the repeal of the 18th Amendment.The unforeseen catastrophes of the 18th Amendment which were designed to heighten American morality and assuage drunkenness turned America into one of the most alcoholic-driven nations among the industrialized world. Americans drank more booze, partied more, got more drunk, and flaunted the law more often during Prohibition than at any other time in the nation's history since after the Civil War, even as compared to the present time. Possibly only the 1960's are somewhat comparable to the mayhem of the 1920's.The irony of ironies that the decade begun by the Temperance Movement's victory with the passage of the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution in 1919 would be nicknamed the Roarding Twenties and the Jazz Age. This was not a decade known for drinking milk. This was a decade characterized by cocktail glasses in the hands of flappers dancing on tables to the evocative music of Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Men would be raising giant mugs of frothy beer in underground establishments called speakeasies. Only Prohibition allowed the likes of Al Capone and Lucky Luciano to become wealthy gangsters, almost movie stars by today's standards. The leaders of the Temperance Movement, particularly the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Anti-Saloon League, were appalled when their daughters ran off to speakeasies and night clubs to partake of the forbidden fruit. Strangely, Prohibition helped usher in the Night Club culture of America which has continued unabated ever since. All the great night clubs famous for their booze, music, and dancing such as the Cotton Club and the Stork Club, were incepted when alcohol was supposed to be illegal.For some reason, I didn't think Prohibition permeated into so many aspects of American life during its enforcement from 1920 through 1932. People could open small businesses in their basements and make a fortune through bootlegging, and then be hauled away under the Volstead Act. The rise of the Chicago Gang syndicate became a prototype for similar syndicates across the country, all vying for their bootlegging territory. At one point, citizens were legally compelled to snitch on neighbors suspected of bootlegging. The story as presented by Burns/Novick is as compelling as any action thriller being produced today. A great movie of American history, with all the elements that make a great story. Essentially it's a legal thriller with sex, violence, and lots of booze. Lots of it.",5,Greatest Legal Miscalculation of 20th Century America Documented in Outstanding Burns/Novick Film,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,5470,"['favorite', 'comment', 'documentary', 'offered',

And I enjoyed this documentary quite as well.There are three dvds in here, for a total of more than 6 hours of footage. The first dvd covers the birth of the idea of prohibiting alcohol from Americans' lives, back in the 1800s: how people lived, what they drank and how much, how this affected everyday life, how the first prohibition movements worked. The second discusses the life of the 18th Amendment: how it was lobbied by the anti-saloon league, the way distrust towards immigrants played a big part in it, how this changed the life of people, especially youth. The last dvd addresses the way gangsters profited from the law, how this took away the trust of people for the law and order and especially for Prohibition, how when the Great Depression kicked in the 18th Amendment was finally repealed.There is a huge amount of images from the time discussed. Mainly photographs in the first dvd, but a huge amount of it. So many videos in the other two, coming from Twenties films, but also non-fiction footage and even some personal photos and video. I love this.Beside interview with experts - including Okrent - there are a number of interviews with people who were young during Prohibition. Oral history is incredible. People who remember often have a very different view, their tales have a different mood from the commentary from experts. And the one always enriches the other.There is a thing where the documentary goes in a different direction than the book. Where the book focuses on everyday life and the way Prohibition affected it, the documentary focuses more on personalities. Politicians, anti-saloon league members, judges, cops, personalities of different kind, including journalists and gangsters. Where the book only touches upon these people's life and involvement in Prohibition, the documentary gives a full portrait of them, and I liked a lot the way stories mixed with images. It gives a very strong feeling for the era.So, maybe there is nothing particularly new about the info the documentary provides: it's the same as the book, is basically the same as so many other books about Prohibition.

This 3-part 5-1/2 hour PBS series kept my eyes glued to the screen while my own impressions of the world of prohibition, which were mostly gleaned from stories my parents told me, became real through the old film clips and the excellent narration and historical perspective.Looking back, it seems as if the nation was crazy to actually pass a law that prohibited alcoholic beverages in all its forms.  But times were different then. In the small town Americana of 1919 men were getting dead drunk and abusing their families.  For the first time in history, women asserted themselves and organized the Women's Christian Temperance Union, marching in the streets and eventually influencing legislation. It was different in the cities however, where an immigrant population did not see liquor as a menace.  Thus began the age of Prohibition and the biggest crime wave and social change that America has ever seen.This documentary tells it all with excellent film clips, fine historical research and clear and focused narration.  I loved every minute of it, learned a lot, and revisited old stories told to me as a child.

1421148,A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B004NJC0R0,"Paul Tognetti ""The real world is so much more...","[1, 2]","As Ken Burns explains in his remarkable 6 hour presentation ""Prohibition"" when the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect on January 17, 1920 no one was quite sure how it all was going to play out.  The road that led to the passage of the Volstead Act in 1919 had been a long and arduous one.  The American Temperance Society had been calling for such a law for nearly a century.  Through an unlikely coalition that included both conservatives and progressives what was deemed the ""Noble Experiment"" would wreak havoc on the nation for a dozen years.  ""Prohibition"" chronicles the history of the temperance movement, the forces that coalesced to make the national ban on the sale, manufacture, and transportation of alcohol a reality, as well as the tragic and unanticipated consequences of it all.  Furthermore, Burns devotes a considerable amount of time to the considerable role that women played in making it all come about.  This is a riveting tale that managed to hold my attention from start to finish.So what were some of those consequences that I referred to?  For those engaged in the business of winemaking at the outset of Prohibition in 1920 precious few options were available.  With the stroke of a pen their world had been turned upside down.  Federal law allowed for the manufacture of ""sacramental"" wines but this market was clearly very limited.  Some growers would be forced to sell their grapes for juice while others chose to plant other crops like apricots just to survive.  The fact of the matter is that no one in wine country believed that prohibition was going to last as long as it did.  As time wore on more and more families became desperate.  Denied the ability to earn an honest living many vineyard owners turned to the only option the felt they had left--bootlegging--and sold off what wine they had on hand to hotels and speakeasies.  The same would be true for distillers. Under the cover of night these previously law-abiding citizens shipped illicit vino and spirits to major cities such as San Francisco, New York and Chicago.  With all of this of course came great risk.  If they were nabbed by the federal authorities they were subject to stiff fines and possible arrest.  In many cases federal Prohibition officers would descend on their property and empty their tanks into the local river or creek.  Years of hard work literally went down the drain in just a few minutes.  Some of the footage Burns offers is just heartbreaking to watch.  Meanwhile, many local law enforcement officers, clearly sympathetic to the plight of their friends and neighbors, would attempt to thwart the feds.  It was an unsettling and messy situation that made thieves and liars and criminals out of a whole host of people. In his film Ken Burns introduces us to small-time whiskey jobbers, well-heeled bootleggers and a whole host of gangsters who would would step in to fill the void and make millions doing it.  And of course a major part of the story was the gang violence that would emerge across the nation, most especially in Chicago.  Burns spends considerable time covering this aspect of the story and the footage is incredible.  While the so-called ""Drys"" certainly ruled the day in the 1920's it was becoming abundantly clear by the dawn of the 1930's that their considerable influence was waning and that it was only a matter of time before Prohibition would come to an end.  Ken Burns does a workmanlike job of covering this aspect of the story as well.As is almost always the case in a Ken Burns production,  the still photos, vintage footage and music presented in this film are quite extraordinary. No one does it quite like Ken Burns.  I enjoyed it so much that I was even motivated to watch the bonus features. One of them captured jazz legend Wynton Marsalis and his band recording much of the music that you hear in ""Prohibition"".  As I recall Marsalis composed quite a bit of this music especially for this film.  Great stuff!  Another bonus feature showed Tom Hanks, Paul Giamatti and Patricia Clarkson recording some of the narration for the film.  These features make you appreciate just how complex and time-consuming a task it is to put these films together.  I found ""Prohibition"" to be a comprehensive, informative and highly entertaining film.  There seems to be no aspect of this subject that Ken Burns failed to cover.  There is an awful lot to learn and to enjoy here.  In my view,  ""Prohibition"" is history at it's best.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[33, 44]","PBS documentarian Burns shares the byline credit this time around with his business partner Lynn Novick. The script is again by Geoffrey C. Ward, based on his book. As noted by a previous reviewer here there are factual errors and they should be blamed on Ward. Burns is more interested in the collages he creates from thousands (literally - just look at the ed credits) of stills that he mixes with some silent film footage with newly added sound effects (""talking pictures"" were not common until 1927 - except for experimental film). Then he adds famous actors reading quotes from people relevant to the story at hand.The show is divided into three parts and these are each placed on a separate DVD in the 3-disc package. The parts run about 100 minutes each. There are just over 90 minutes of ""bonus features"", consisting of a seven-minute ""behind the scenes"" (music scoring, the celebrity voices), deleted scenes (about 25 minutes) and 16 interview segments (totaling 53 minutes) of raw footage with timing counters.There is no booklet or other informational insert in the package that is more generic than other Burns DVDs from PBS.Burns is discussing a subject - not necessarily a time period - and spends the first third of the program just leading up to why prohibition occurred.While some of the facts are wrong, so is the music - at least for the period. Many of the songs you will hear in the background are from the 1930s, not the `teens or the twenties. But most folks won't notice - as they won't notice the factual inaccuracies.Burns does ""slick"" and ""visually appealing"" films and this is just another one of those. It's worth spending time with and - if you liked what you saw and heard on TV, the DVD gives you more of it; it's just not ""dressed up"" like it was on TV.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,Another Ken Burns PBS documentary that mostly hits but sometimes misses.,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,1819,"['PBS', 'documentarian', 'Burns', 'shares', 'byline', 'credit', 'time', 'around', 'business', 'partner', 'Lynn', 'Novick', 'script', 'again', 'Geoffrey', 'C.', 'Ward', 'based', 'book', 'noted', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'here', 'are', 'factual', 'errors', 'should', 'be', 'blamed', 'Ward', 'Burns', 'more', 'interested', 'collages', 'thousands', 'literally', 'just', 'look', 'ed', 'credits', 'stills', 'silent', 'film', 'footage', 'newly', 'added', 'sound', 'effects', 'talking', 'pictures', 'were', 'not', 'common', '1927', 'experimental', 'film', 'Then', 'famous', 'actors', 'reading', 'quotes', 'people', 'relevant', 'story', 'hand.The', 'show', 'divided', 'three', 'parts', 'are', 'placed', 'separate', 'DVD', '3-disc', 'package', 'parts', 'run', '100', 'minutes', 'are', 'just', '90', 'minutes', 'bonus', 'features', 'consisting', 'seven-minute', 'scenes', 'music', 'scoring', 'celebrity', 'voices', 'deleted', 'scenes', '25', 'minutes', '16', 'interview', 'segments', 'totaling', '53', 'minutes', 'raw', 'footage', 'timing', 'booklet', 'other', 'informational', 'insert', 'package', 'more', 'generic', 'other', 'Burns', 'DVDs', 'PBS.Burns', 'discussing', 'subject', 'not', 'necessarily', 'time', 'period', 'first', 'third', 'program', 'just', 'leading', 'up', 'why', 'prohibition', 'facts', 'are', 'wrong', 'so', 'music', 'least', 'period', 'Many', 'songs', 'will', 'hear', 'background', 'are', '1930s', 'not', 'teens', 'twenties', 'most', 'folks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'factual', 'inaccuracies.Burns', 'slick', 'visually', 'appealing', 'films', 'just', 'one', 'worth', 'spending', 'time', 'liked', 'what', 'saw', 'heard', 'TV', 'DVD', 'more', 'just', 'not', 'dressed', 'up', 'was', 'TV.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Ken Burns: Prohibition
