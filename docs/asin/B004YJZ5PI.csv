1433293,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004YJZ5PI,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Transit succeeds where very little other thrillers do- this one keeps the pace intact for the entire time without even *one* second of boredom.  If you blink you'll miss a lot.  It's about four robbers that come up with this plan to put a bag of stolen money with this family headed for a vacation.  Apparently the reason behind this is, so the police don't suspect anything when the criminals are pulled over and have their vehicle searched.  The police can't arrest four guilty-looking people based solely on looking guilty *especially* if there's no bag of stolen money in their possession, right?Well the truth is, it seems suspicious that the cops wouldn't notice that these robbers looked familiar and would therefore arrest them on the spot, so we'll assume it was a clueless cop that pulled them over and searched their vehicle.  Then again, if the robbery was recent and this was the first time they've committed a crime, the cops wouldn't yet have an idea what the suspects look like.  With this in mind, this particular plothole might not exist and is totally forgivable.With all the commotion going on between the bad guys and the family switching back and forth from one segment to another at lightning speed, it took several minutes to figure out who was actually who.  Perhaps a poor way of introducing the characters, but not terrible since all the pieces were soon to fall into place.Anyway, once the robbers are free to roam the streets, they search for the family that unwillingly has their money in their possession (mixed in with the other camping trip bags) and from here... all you-know-what breaks loose!  It's then a game of survival as the family argues, yells, runs, drives, hides, swims, uses any and all weapons they can find such as guns and knives, all in an attempt to get rid of these feisty criminals that always seem to be right behind them.  PURE action-packed, and the movie doesn't disappoint.Terrific acting all around, great storytelling that's easy to understand (after the first 10 minutes) and a fantastic movie overall.",5,action packed to the max,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,2063,"['Transit', 'where', 'very', 'little', 'other', 'thrillers', 'do-', 'one', 'pace', 'intact', 'entire', 'time', 'even', '*one*', 'second', 'boredom', 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'lot', 'four', 'robbers', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'put', 'bag', 'stolen', 'money', 'family', 'headed', 'vacation', 'Apparently', 'reason', 'police', 'do', ""n't"", 'suspect', 'anything', 'when', 'criminals', 'are', 'pulled', 'have', 'vehicle', 'searched', 'police', 'ca', ""n't"", 'arrest', 'four', 'guilty-looking', 'people', 'based', 'solely', 'looking', 'guilty', '*especially*', 'bag', 'stolen', 'money', 'possession', 'right', 'Well', 'truth', 'suspicious', 'cops', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'robbers', 'looked', 'familiar', 'would', 'therefore', 'arrest', 'spot', ""'ll"", 'assume', 'was', 'clueless', 'cop', 'pulled', 'over', 'searched', 'vehicle', 'Then', 'again', 'robbery', 'was', 'recent', 'was', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'committed', 'crime', 'cops', 'would', ""n't"", 'yet', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'suspects', 'look', 'mind', 'particular', 'plothole', 'might', 'not', 'exist', 'totally', 'forgivable.With', 'commotion', 'going', 'bad', 'guys', 'family', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'one', 'segment', 'lightning', 'speed', 'took', 'several', 'minutes', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'who', 'Perhaps', 'poor', 'way', 'introducing', 'characters', 'not', 'terrible', 'pieces', 'were', 'soon', 'fall', 'place.Anyway', 'once', 'robbers', 'are', 'free', 'roam', 'streets', 'search', 'family', 'unwillingly', 'money', 'possession', 'mixed', 'other', 'camping', 'trip', 'bags', 'here', 'you-know-what', 'breaks', 'loose', 'then', 'game', 'survival', 'family', 'yells', 'runs', 'drives', 'hides', 'swims', 'weapons', 'can', 'find', 'such', 'guns', 'knives', 'attempt', 'get', 'rid', 'feisty', 'criminals', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'right', 'PURE', 'action-packed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'disappoint.Terrific', 'acting', 'around', 'great', 'storytelling', 'easy', 'understand', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'overall']",Transit

A family unknowningly ends up transporting stolen money thru a roadblock and the crooks need to get it back.  What happens after is non-stop action.  What's really great is that the plot has no major flaws in it. No obvious ""That doesn't make sense..."" situations.  Nothing profound here, just the crooks rather violently try to get the money back.  It's entertaining, and you want to see how it turns out.  The criminals are ruthless.  The family while not necessarily endearing (obviously there is not a lot of room for character development), will have you rooting for them. In fact I found myself sympathizing with the father in his efforts to save his marraige and pull his family together given his sordid past.  The acting is solid.I haven't rated a movie 5 stars before, but if you are just looking to be entertained, you're not wasting your money here (if this type of movie appeals to you). I have been sadly disappointed with some recent releases like ""Rampart"" and ""The Grey"", primarily because the ending was ambiguous and/or there were some serious flaws in the plot that were distracting.

The acting is actually quite impressive, particularly for a movie of this sort. Though they're not multi-layered, the ""good guys"" aren't necessarily cardboard cutouts and one sympathizes with their plight. Although the ""bad guys"" could have easily been written as archetypes and, at moments, seem to be in danger of falling into cartoon bad guy land, the actors, script writer, and director overall manage to depict bad guys who one can be interested in observing as the characters think through their next moves and evolve throughout the movie. Overall, the movie depicts not a wholly unbelievable premise and turn of events; which is good as that helped me to be even more engrossed in the film.I subtracted one star from the rating because there are a few moments where one finds themselves thinking, ""Uh, why would you do that?!"" I'll give you one example that doesn't give any crucial points away in the movie (but if you don't like learning anything about what occurs in a movie before watching it, skip to the next paragraph): The father smashes his own cell phone on a deserted stretch of highway. Huh?Anyhow, because of a few head-scratching moments like that, it gets 4 stars. But know that it held my attention throughout and I felt it an entertaining 2 hours of viewing. As an aside, there is a great deal of swearing and a bit of gore, most of it implied/happens off-camera in the early part of the movie.

Jim Caveizel was amazing as the Dad who is trying to pull his family out of this trouble.his wife played by Elizabeth Rohm was also very good, and the bad guys were also well acted in this film, lead by James Frain who has that evil look.the setting of the film which mostly takes place on the road and in swamps surrounding the road added much to the film, and the actions was very solid with some good production values. the movie never felt like a low budget or a B-movie to me.in short, one of the better thrillers out there, and im quite surprised how this movie fell below the radar, very enjoyable and entertaining.I would recommend this highly, and also recommendThe Contractwhich is very similar to this. enjoy",4,"An entertaining thriller, worthy to add to your DVD collection",1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,1410,"['Absolutely', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'full', 'Transit', 'exactly', 'type', 'movies', 'i', 'thriller', 'action.Jim', 'Caveizel', 'dad', 'who', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'family', 'taking', 'camping', 'unfortunately', 'get', 'caught', 'cat', 'mouse', 'chase', 'gruesome', 'gang', '4', 'who', 'just', 'robbed', 'armored', 'truck', 'used', 'family', 'sneak', 'money', 'check', 'point.the', 'film', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'chase', 'thriller', '4', 'very', 'skilled', 'badies', 'pursuing', 'normal', 'suburban', 'family', 'road', 'thrills', 'twists', 'turns', 'solid', 'action.the', 'cast', 'really', 'movie', 'stronger', 'actors', 'playing', 'parts', 'perfection', 'Jim', 'Caveizel', 'was', 'amazing', 'Dad', 'who', 'trying', 'pull', 'family', 'trouble.his', 'wife', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Rohm', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'also', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'lead', 'James', 'Frain', 'who', 'evil', 'look.the', 'setting', 'film', 'mostly', 'place', 'road', 'swamps', 'surrounding', 'road', 'added', 'much', 'film', 'actions', 'was', 'very', 'solid', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'movie', 'never', 'felt', 'low', 'budget', 'B-movie', 'me.in', 'short', 'one', 'better', 'thrillers', 'there', 'quite', 'surprised', 'how', 'movie', 'fell', 'radar', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'highly', 'also', 'recommendThe', 'Contractwhich', 'very', 'similar', 'enjoy']",Transit

They have just robbed an armored money truck, and have four million dollars in a bag with them. Now one of them thinks of a brilliant idea; let's hide the bag in someone else's car, someone who does not look like a robber! All they have to do is follow the car, pass through the blockade and retrieve the bag later.James Caviezel plays Nate, on a family vacation with his wife Robin (Elisabeth R&ouml;hm) and two sons, among whose camping gear a bag full of money is concealed. James Frain plays Marek, leader of the criminals, whose ""perfect"" plan, as you expect, goes awry when Nate realizes someone is chasing his car.The story of the low-budget actioner unfolds like a good, old-fashioned B movie, with some nice stunts including car chases and shoot-outs, and lots of illogical motives on the part of the hunters and the hunted. If you think the gang's decision to hide the bag is stupid enough (yes, it is), there are more silly moments to come in the film's running time. You might ask yourself: why walking into the swamps? Why driving in such a conspicuous way? Why?But somehow I didn't hate the film simply because I didn't care all these silly details.

1433315,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B004YJZ5PI,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[2, 2]","""Seconds Apart"" director Antonio Negret generates some genuine adrenaline-fueled thrills, chills, and spills in his second feature length release. The rural crime thriller ""Transit"" qualifies as an exciting road picture about four murderous thieves who tangle with an innocent family in backwater Louisiana over a fortune in stolen loot. The only shortcoming of this above-average but formulaic melodrama is its lackluster ending that deprives the protagonist of any reward for his heroic deeds. Fortunately, the cast is convincing, particularly Jim Caviezel as the devastated dad and James Frain as the desperate villain. The ignorant authorities are clueless about what is happening between the heroes and the villains. Ironically, the lawmen  only complicate matters and imperil our hero and his family. Frain looks particularly degenerate as the sleazy gang leader, while Harold Perrineau registers intensely as a trigger-happy henchman. ""According to Greta"" scenarist Michael Gilvary has cross-stitched the plots from the Dana Andrews' epic ""Hot Rods to Hell"" and the Audrey Hepburn nail-biter ""Wait Until Dark."" In `Hot Rods to Hell,"" rebellious teens terrorize a family on a deserted stretch of highway. In ""Wait Until Dark,"" a deadly drug dealer stashes his narcotics in the blind heroine's luggage for a transoceanic flight and the villains invade her New York apartment.In ""Transit,"" a quartet of reckless armored car robbers need to get past a police roadblock. They replace the camping gear strapped down to the top of the Sidwell family SUV with their ill-gotten gains. Initially, our heroes have no clue about the dastards after them. Marek (James Frain of ""Titus""), Arielle (Diora Baird of ""Wedding Crashers""), Losada (Harold Perrineaus of ""The Matrix Revolutions""), and Evers (Ryan Donowho of ""Broken Flowers"") have fooled themselves into believing that they can retrieve their loot from the unsuspecting family before they realize that they've  been used as a mule. Naturally, nothing goes right for either side and those are the best dramatic moments. The conflict emerges from the situation. Our hero Nate (Jim Caviezel of ""Outlander"") has just been paroled from prison. He served time for real estate fraud. Now, Nate is struggling to get his wife Robyn (Elisabeth R&ouml;hm of ""Abduction"") and sons together for a vacation when they run afoul of the bad guys. Some of the action will take you by surprise. Neither Negret nor Gilvary make it easy for either the heroes or their adversaries. No sooner do the villains have the loot than they lose it. Not long after the hero appropriates the millions, he loses it in the swamp.The black 1972 Chevrolet Chevelle that the villains drive assumes a character of its own and the long shots of it hauling down the highway look as cool as the spinning tire shots. Negret handles the chase sequences with aplomb. The car crash involving the Sheriff Deputy's Crown Victoria is awesome. ""Transit"" never wears out its welcome.",4,"Gear Up for Action with ""Transit!""",1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,2984,"['Seconds', 'Apart', 'director', 'Antonio', 'Negret', 'genuine', 'adrenaline-fueled', 'thrills', 'chills', 'spills', 'second', 'feature', 'length', 'release', 'rural', 'crime', 'thriller', 'Transit', 'exciting', 'road', 'picture', 'four', 'murderous', 'thieves', 'who', 'tangle', 'innocent', 'family', 'backwater', 'Louisiana', 'fortune', 'stolen', 'loot', 'only', 'shortcoming', 'above-average', 'formulaic', 'melodrama', 'lackluster', 'ending', 'protagonist', 'reward', 'heroic', 'deeds', 'Fortunately', 'cast', 'convincing', 'particularly', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'devastated', 'dad', 'James', 'Frain', 'desperate', 'villain', 'ignorant', 'authorities', 'are', 'clueless', 'what', 'happening', 'heroes', 'villains', 'Ironically', 'lawmen', 'only', 'complicate', 'matters', 'imperil', 'hero', 'family', 'Frain', 'particularly', 'degenerate', 'sleazy', 'gang', 'leader', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'intensely', 'trigger-happy', 'henchman', 'According', 'Greta', 'scenarist', 'Michael', 'Gilvary', 'cross-stitched', 'plots', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'epic', 'Hot', 'Rods', 'Hell', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'nail-biter', 'Wait', 'Dark', 'Hot', 'Rods', 'Hell', 'rebellious', 'teens', 'terrorize', 'family', 'deserted', 'stretch', 'highway', 'Wait', 'Dark', 'deadly', 'drug', 'dealer', 'narcotics', 'blind', 'heroine', 'luggage', 'transoceanic', 'flight', 'villains', 'invade', 'New', 'York', 'apartment.In', 'Transit', 'quartet', 'reckless', 'armored', 'car', 'robbers', 'need', 'get', 'police', 'roadblock', 'replace', 'camping', 'gear', 'strapped', 'down', 'top', 'Sidwell', 'family', 'SUV', 'ill-gotten', 'gains', 'Initially', 'heroes', 'have', 'clue', 'dastards', 'Marek', 'James', 'Frain', 'Titus', 'Arielle', 'Diora', 'Baird', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Losada', 'Harold', 'Perrineaus', 'Matrix', 'Revolutions', 'Evers', 'Ryan', 'Donowho', 'Broken', 'Flowers', 'have', 'fooled', 'believing', 'can', 'retrieve', 'loot', 'unsuspecting', 'family', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'been', 'used', 'mule', 'Naturally', 'nothing', 'right', 'side', 'are', 'best', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'conflict', 'situation', 'hero', 'Nate', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'Outlander', 'just', 'been', 'paroled', 'prison', 'served', 'time', 'real', 'estate', 'fraud', 'Now', 'Nate', 'struggling', 'get', 'wife', 'Robyn', 'Elisabeth', 'R', 'ouml', 'hm', 'Abduction', 'together', 'vacation', 'when', 'run', 'afoul', 'bad', 'guys', 'action', 'will', 'take', 'surprise', 'Negret', 'Gilvary', 'make', 'easy', 'heroes', 'adversaries', 'sooner', 'do', 'villains', 'have', 'loot', 'lose', 'Not', 'long', 'hero', 'millions', 'swamp.The', 'black', '1972', 'Chevrolet', 'Chevelle', 'villains', 'drive', 'character', 'own', 'long', 'shots', 'hauling', 'down', 'highway', 'look', 'as', 'cool', 'spinning', 'tire', 'shots', 'Negret', 'chase', 'aplomb', 'car', 'crash', 'involving', 'Sheriff', 'Deputy', 'Crown', 'Victoria', 'awesome', 'Transit', 'never', 'out', 'welcome']",Transit
