1005103,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000GJ0NU2,A Customer,"[7, 12]","In An American Haunting, a heavily stylistic gothic mode piece, things really do go bump in the night. Well, not so much bump, but more like thrashing around. Along with banging noises in the attic, slamming doors and windows, spinning clocks, shaking beds, rabid beasts, disappearing children, the movie offers up a barrage of sights and sounds and spooky shocks.Heavy on the atmosphere, An American Haunting is supposedly a true story of the Bell Witch incident of 1818-21, which is supposed the most documented paranormal event in America and the only case that officially attributed a man's death to a spirit. The film uses a present-day framing device in which an adolescent girl is haunted by nightmares of an invisible intruder after discovering an old journal, an ancient doll and an equally ancient letter.When her mother starts reading the journal, the film flashes back to the early 1800's where the Bell family of Tennessee is in a spot of bother. Up until now, Mr. Bell (Donald Sutherland) has been a respected figure in the community but it seems that he has charged a certain Kate Batts (Gaye Brown) 20% interest on a loan and then used her failure to pay, to take the land he was renting from her.The court offers a kind of quasi-religious judgment saying it was usury, but when the judges don't exact enough punishment, Batt's puts a curse on Bell and his beautiful teenage daughter Betsy (Rachel Hurd-Wood). It doesn't take long for spirits to appear and what starts out as something sounding like squirrels banging in the attic turns into a full-blown poltergeist as Betsy's covers are pulled off her bed and she's thrust around her bedroom hanging from her hair and smacked across the face.Whilst Betsy's father gradually deteriorates, falling ill, and seems resigned to his fate, is wife Lucy Mother Lucy (Sissy Spacek) and son John Jr. (Thom Fell) are really concerned, but haven't a clue what to do. Documenting the unsettling events in his journal is Betsy's initially skeptical teacher (James D'Arcy), whose attraction to the girl is encouraged by Lucy for grim reasons made clear in the film's final moments.The performances are all strong, especially from veterans Sutherland and Spacek, and the revelation when it comes is actually quite a surprise. The pacing is tight and the period detail and the sense of time and place is beautifully wraught. Pulse-quickening elements abound, from cinematographer Adrian Biddle's circular camerawork, in wintry Bucharest and Montreal locations, to the dynamic sound design and Caine Davidson's all-enveloping musical score.Some may find the episodes where Betsy is being tossed around in her bed, dragged across the floor, held suspended in midair and slapped by an invisible entity, a bit silly. And there's a real question mark over how much of these events are actually true and how much has been embellished for the film.Still, the movie manages to boast a gothic visual atmosphere that's quite appropriate for this type of story. Those eerie forests, dimly lit rooms, washed-out dreamscapes, and dark rainy nights really give you a creepy feeling and really help perpetuate the foreboding ambience that something is not quite right at Bell House.

1005111,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000GJ0NU2,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I have mixed feelings with An American Haunting.  On one hand the visual presentation is amazing, but unfortunately the actual horror and suspense is more along the lines of a total disappointment.The story mainly focuses on the one daughter of the house.  Angry ghosts visit the girl in her sleep and torment the heck out of her by rolling the blankets off her bed, toss her across the floor so her fingernails dig into the floor boards, and slam the bedroom door with the occasional ghostly howls in the background.  These are the constant problems the poor girl has to face every night which leads to her sleeping through school the day after.Eventually the family realizes the daughter is being attacked by ghosts because they can't find explanations for the things going on in her room (and they actually SEE the daughter suspended high in the air getting slapped across the face repeatedly).  I know one solution that would have worked- remove the bedroom door so it won't slam shut whenever the family tries to enter the bedroom.Donald Sutherland is one of the stars of the movie, if not the main star (though Donald and the daughter share just as much movie time).I totally didn't get the ending though.  What I'm about to say is a SPOILER so if you don't want to know what happens in the movie, skip this next paragraph entirely.At the end of the film, Donald goes to visit the woman who he believes put a curse on his family.  She tells him she had nothing to do with it.  Then Donald is seen in the middle of a field pointing a gun to his head which doesn't go off.  This leads to him breaking down crying.  Then the story quickly switches back to the daughters bedroom where the evil spirits continue to rear their ugly heads.  You then see Donald Sutherland standing in the bedroom with the daughter.  Then after all this is over with (after a certain lengthy amount of time has gone by) the mother sees a spirit image of her daughter standing in the living room after the daughter leaves the house.  Then the film is over.  *What* *the* *heck?*Anyway, the film certainly LOOKS good, and the movie tried to deliver some suspense by focusing on a storyline that happened 200 years ago and made the characters of that time period look and act as believable as possible, but it just didn't satisfy my horror needs.

Perhaps there was a kernel of truth in the premise, but the 'Omen' type characters and action were not what would have happened in the 1800's smalltown Tennessee in the rural regions.The sainted old man (Bell) ridiculed publicly the woman he stole from and refused to take blame for his criminal actions.  He was asking for trouble.  Hell and damnation fell on his household, but it wasn't caused by a mere human.  The devil took his toll for the callousness of a warped fallen ""angel.""  The church hierarchy recommended redemption for his sins, which he refused to admit.  After all, duping an old single woman and taking her respect away is no sin -- in his religious eyes.  He got his reward!At the college in Pulaski, the dean told us stories of some of the past at his hometown, Adams, Tennessee.  When we'd have a Halloween gathering in the gym (couldn't call it a ""party"" like I tried to do on my weekly radio broadcast, ""News from the Martin Campus,"" as were were Methodists in a small town and had to set an example of Christian integrity), he'd regale the group with scary episodes about this Bell witch.  On another occasion, he returned from his University position in Kansas to speak again on that subject, for a special event.  The thing which stuck in my memory was that she could be seen carrying a lantern on dark nights walking up the railroad tracks.  Now, that is scary.  Some folks claim they really saw her ghost ""on the tracks"" some Halloween nights around midnight.Donald Sutherland, acting as John Bell, was just a reprise of his role in 'The Last Living Confederate Widow.'  Had this been filmed in the area of Adams, Tennessee, instead of some weird foreign place, it might have been believable.  The dean's son appeared in the most recent Hallmark production of James Agee's book filmed in Middle Tennessee and was panned simply because it was not a local performance.  In the 60s, there was a movie made here about the book, and David Alford (from Adams, Tennessee) could not be blamed for the location which had been in Franklin.This American ""haunting"" was pure Hollywood -- not much actual facts involved, and so I came away perplexed at the ""things"" I saw on the screen.

To make it simple, Hollywood chooses to create a fable having the &#34;Christian&#34; father raping his own daughter Betsy. Thus, slandering John Bell's good name. To make matters worse, the people behind this film actually have John's daughter, Besty, poisoning her father as John's wife looks on with approval?? &#34;WRONG'!!! There is absolutely nothing in history that even questions the possibility of John Bell being a child molester, or Besty Bell, and mother, murdering the poor man.

Simply put, An American Haunting is the best haunted house movie I have ever seen.  I have to admit I did not like or approve of the way the story ended, and the modern-day intro and exit scenes were wholly unnecessary, but everything in between is pure haunted gold.  I have to believe that some viewers' dissatisfaction comes from knowing what happens before they see the movie, as even the editorial review on this page reveals one of the film's core secrets.  As much as I disapprove of its existence, that particular secret (which bears the unmistakable fingerprints of sleazy Hollywood) plays out beautifully in the film's presentation.  Cut out the modern-day cinematic bookends, and this film has one of the most impressive scripts I've come across in some time.  The much-ballyhooed cast play up to their potential and then some, the direction is flawless, and the special effects (including the POV scenes that some viewers ridicule) are, to my mind, incredibly effective.  I absolutely love An American Haunting.Basing itself on the only documented case in US history of a spirit causing someone's death, An American Haunting basically markets itself.  Don't get too wrapped up in the historicity of this movie, though, as director Courtney Solomon plays fast and loose with the true story of the Bell Witch.  The ""based on true events"" moniker is in fact quite disingenuous, as this movie is really based on Brent Monahan's purely fictional novel The Bell Witch: An American Haunting.  Anyone who knows anything about hauntings knows the legend of the Bell Witch, an entity that no less a man than Andrew Jackson supposedly confronted (although there's no evidence to substantiate that claim), but this is not the real Bell Witch's story.John Bell (Donald Sutherland) was a big man in his little Tennessee town - until the church fathers condemned him for charging Kate Batts too much interest on a loan.  Batts, widely reputed to be a witch, openly threatens Bell and his innocent daughter Betsy (Rachel Hurd-Wood), and it isn't long at all until strange things start happening in and around the Bell home.  Bell starts seeing animal spirits that disappear in the wink of an eye, increasingly disturbing scratching and running sounds in the attic and roof begin disturbing the family's sleep, and all too soon young Betsy is targeted for physical abuse by an unseen spirit.  John and his wife Lucy (Sissy Spacek) initially believe Betsy is having nightmares, but the sight of their daughter suspended in midair while being slapped around mercilessly by an unseen spirit pretty much puts an end to the nightmare theory.  Now desperate, John calls in the local school teacher Richard Powell (James D'Arcy), who insists there is a natural explanation for what is happening - until he sees the entity's handiwork for himself.  As the nightly attacks become increasingly violent and terrifying, we witness the toll it takes on everyone concerned, particularly John and Betsy.  All the while, almost unnoticeably at times, important little puzzle pieces are being dropped along the way - and that is why the ending, as much as I disapprove of it, works so amazingly well.I thought the way the director approached the presentation of the attacks was exceedingly effective, particularly the entity point-of-view shots.  Some viewers apparently disagree with me on that, but I thought all of the unconventional camera work made the attacks all the more real and visceral - and ratcheted up the sense of helplessness and chaos in the house.  This movie definitely has the potential to scare more than a few viewers.  The casting director deserves a ton of credit, as well.  The gorgeous Rachel Hurd-Wood truly brings Betsy to life, and I can't overstate just how challenging that role must have been.  Sissy Spacek and Donald Sutherland are even more impressive as John and Lucy Bell.  Sutherland was the perfect choice for John Bell, while Spacek works wonders in what I consider a somewhat understated role.I know I'm repeating myself here, but I have to state once again that An American Haunting is the best haunted house (for want of a better term) movie I have ever seen.  I can't for the life of me understand why some many critics and viewers have panned this film.  Methinks the fact that a movie this riveting and impressive can be so disparaged does much to explain why Hollywood turns out so much brainless drivel these days.",5,A criminally underrated horror masterpiece,1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,4561,"['are', 'many', 'things', 'world', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'one', 'how', 'movie', 'ratings', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'low', 'Simply', 'put', 'American', 'Haunting', 'best', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'approve', 'way', 'story', 'ended', 'modern-day', 'intro', 'exit', 'scenes', 'were', 'wholly', 'unnecessary', 'everything', 'pure', 'haunted', 'gold', 'have', 'believe', 'viewers', 'dissatisfaction', 'knowing', 'what', 'see', 'movie', 'even', 'editorial', 'review', 'page', 'one', 'film', 'core', 'secrets', 'As', 'much', 'disapprove', 'existence', 'particular', 'secret', 'unmistakable', 'fingerprints', 'sleazy', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'beautifully', 'film', 'presentation', 'Cut', 'out', 'modern-day', 'cinematic', 'bookends', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'scripts', ""'ve"", 'come', 'time', 'much-ballyhooed', 'cast', 'play', 'up', 'potential', 'then', 'direction', 'flawless', 'special', 'effects', 'including', 'POV', 'scenes', 'viewers', 'ridicule', 'are', 'mind', 'incredibly', 'effective', 'absolutely', 'love', 'American', 'Haunting.Basing', 'only', 'documented', 'case', 'US', 'history', 'spirit', 'causing', 'someone', 'death', 'American', 'Haunting', 'basically', 'markets', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'historicity', 'movie', 'though', 'director', 'Courtney', 'Solomon', 'fast', 'loose', 'true', 'story', 'Bell', 'Witch', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'moniker', 'fact', 'quite', 'disingenuous', 'movie', 'really', 'based', 'Brent', 'Monahan', 'purely', 'fictional', 'novel', 'Bell', 'Witch', 'American', 'Haunting', 'Anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'hauntings', 'legend', 'Bell', 'Witch', 'entity', 'less', 'man', 'Andrew', 'Jackson', 'supposedly', 'confronted', 'evidence', 'substantiate', 'claim', 'not', 'real', 'Bell', 'Witch', 'story.John', 'Bell', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'big', 'man', 'little', 'Tennessee', 'town', 'church', 'fathers', 'condemned', 'charging', 'Kate', 'Batts', 'too', 'much', 'interest', 'loan', 'Batts', 'widely', 'reputed', 'be', 'witch', 'openly', 'Bell', 'innocent', 'daughter', 'Betsy', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', ""n't"", 'long', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'Bell', 'home', 'Bell', 'seeing', 'animal', 'spirits', 'disappear', 'wink', 'eye', 'increasingly', 'disturbing', 'scratching', 'running', 'sounds', 'attic', 'roof', 'begin', 'disturbing', 'family', 'sleep', 'too', 'soon', 'young', 'Betsy', 'targeted', 'physical', 'abuse', 'unseen', 'spirit', 'John', 'wife', 'Lucy', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'initially', 'believe', 'Betsy', 'having', 'nightmares', 'sight', 'daughter', 'suspended', 'midair', 'being', 'slapped', 'mercilessly', 'unseen', 'spirit', 'pretty', 'much', 'end', 'nightmare', 'theory', 'Now', 'desperate', 'John', 'local', 'school', 'teacher', 'Richard', 'Powell', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'who', 'natural', 'explanation', 'what', 'happening', 'entity', 'handiwork', 'nightly', 'become', 'increasingly', 'violent', 'terrifying', 'witness', 'toll', 'everyone', 'concerned', 'particularly', 'John', 'Betsy', 'while', 'almost', 'unnoticeably', 'times', 'important', 'little', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'are', 'being', 'dropped', 'way', 'why', 'ending', 'as', 'much', 'disapprove', 'so', 'amazingly', 'well.I', 'thought', 'way', 'director', 'approached', 'presentation', 'attacks', 'was', 'exceedingly', 'effective', 'particularly', 'entity', 'point-of-view', 'shots', 'viewers', 'apparently', 'disagree', 'thought', 'unconventional', 'camera', 'work', 'made', 'attacks', 'more', 'real', 'visceral', 'ratcheted', 'up', 'sense', 'helplessness', 'chaos', 'house', 'movie', 'definitely', 'potential', 'scare', 'more', 'few', 'viewers', 'casting', 'director', 'ton', 'credit', 'well', 'gorgeous', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'truly', 'Betsy', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overstate', 'just', 'how', 'challenging', 'role', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'John', 'Lucy', 'Bell', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'John', 'Bell', 'Spacek', 'wonders', 'what', 'consider', 'somewhat', 'understated', 'role.I', 'know', ""'m"", 'repeating', 'here', 'have', 'state', 'once', 'again', 'American', 'Haunting', 'best', 'haunted', 'house', 'want', 'better', 'term', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'understand', 'why', 'many', 'critics', 'viewers', 'have', 'panned', 'film', 'fact', 'movie', 'riveting', 'impressive', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'disparaged', 'much', 'explain', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'brainless', 'days']",N/A

This movie SUCKED! The whole movie was just bad. I read about the bell witch case a couple of years ago and read that Hollywood was making a movie based on the facts of the case. I thought what a kickass movie that should be! Then I started to think, a big name studio is making the film so it will probably be PG-13, and all watered down for the kiddies. But I was willing to give the movie a benefit of doubt. Luckily I waited until it came out on DVD and rented it first, I should have stuck with my first thoughts. This movie SUCKS! The filmmakers had an excellant source for a very scary movie how could they go wrong? The all mighty dollar. That's all there is to it, the studio wanted a PG-13 movie that was accessible to a large audience, even if it made no sense at all and they got it. Everything about this movie sucks, you'd think with the great actors and actresses they got it would be great, but I think it was more of a quick payday for them then anything else. The ""surprise"" ending was especially STUPID! Hollywood needs to grow some balls and realize there is no such thing as a PG-13 rated ""horror"" film. The sooner they all realize that the better we'll all be. I know some people are going to be pissed when they read this review so I'll say this.

When John Bell (Donald Sutherland) is cursed by a local woman, strange things start happening to him and his teenage daughter, Betsy (Rachel Hurd-Wood).Initially, the spooky occurrences are limited to weird noises in the house, but the entity gets more and more violent and only seems to attack the father and daughter, while the mother (Sissy Spacek) and older brother (Thom Fell) can only watch in horror.Various attempts at exorcism are performed by both a local reverend (Matthew Marsh) and a schoolteacher (James D'Arcy) but nothing seems to work and the poltergeist keeps getting angrier.The GoodSutherland and Spacek are always good value and they do the best they can, although you can tell that they'd really rather be somewhere else. However, the stand out is Rachel Hurd-Wood, who gives an impressive performance, despite spending large portions of the film in bed. Hopefully she'll go on to bigger and better things after this.The BadThe film's biggest problem is that, like last year's The Exorcism of Emily Rose, it comes across as a cheesy rip-off of The Exorcist. Unfortunately, it's not remotely scary and writer-director Solomon resorts to all sorts of cheap tricks to try and convince us otherwise. That said, the climactic sequence is intriguing, but you can't help feeling the film would have been more effective if the truth had been revealed from the start.However, the film's biggest mistake is to book-end the film with a truly atrocious sequence set in the present day.

The writing is decent enough as well, but for some reason many of the actors seemed to be robotic in the delivery of their lines. One serious plus for the movie was an outstanding music score that goes farther beyond setting the tone for the movie than the eerie talking spirits heard constantly throughout key scenes.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 4]","Oddly enough, there is a bona fide bone-headed witch-ghost-haunting story dating back to 1812 in Tennessee, something that still scares little kids down south. This repulsive and frankly laughable movie claims to tell us the real story.The legend goes something like this: gullible 19th century Southerners get the crap scared out of them by forest-dwelling vermin of unusual size which then follow them home. That is pretty much it.This film has the following plotline: ""Ole"" Bell, a rotten, hypocritical Baptist (sound familiar?) drags a poor lady to court (which is apparently ""the high court"" of the church, not court at all and without legal authority). He sues her after she tries to sue him on the spot, over a land dispute. She then curses his family--hell, I'd have done it too. Land is land!Well, after that rousing scene, the comically filmed, revolting preternatural crap ensues. At moments it made me laugh until the brutally filmed assault on the teen girl. Then I became angry.This situation resolves when we discover that, like the equally silly Ciaran Hinds movie ""The Eclipse"", these folks are being haunted by ""the ghost of someone who is still alive""--it's not only Mrs. Bell but the unfortunate daughter. Turns out good ole boy Bell, 20 years his wife's senior, not only raped her when she was a child but also raped his own daughter. He's reaping what he's sown, and the poor daughter kindly commits fratricide. Will the ghostly justice to be wreaked on nasty Christians never cease?Well, all I can comment further is that I think the writer(s) and director were absolutely high as kites when they made this movie. I can't think of a worse film I've EVER seen. So, good Amazon prospective buyers, know that this film rates about 20,000 on my Cinema-Pew-O-Meter!All fans ought to note this personal post I received dated 13 March, 2012: ""Just to let you know that the author of the original book, Brent Monahan, was not pleased with the screenplay. (He's been a good friend of my husband's since their high school days). If any other movies are made based on his books, he will insist on full control of the script.""Thank you, Sharon A.

Tait,"[1, 7]","After a long-awaited theatrical release of Brent Monahan's truly sinister, if slighly fantastic novel about an entity that terrorises the Bell family, inparticular the daughter Betsy, and claims to be the first ghost to kill a man, I am left feeling ever so disappointed. The performances of Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek were as good as they could be with the scant material they had. It's always difficult to bring an effective adaption to the screen but in most cases you find yourself saying, ""if only I had made it, it would have included this and this...!"" For me I was expecting something a bit more from the ghost. In the book the ghost is one of the central characters and builds one to one relationships, and much of the dialogue from the ghost, (yes, that's what I said), forms much of the intrigue and wonder, and certainly holds the key to the twist in the tale. Unfortunately, none of the great scenes with interaction between the ghost and the characters was included. And it was those scenes that I wanted to see in the first place. Most irritating was the prologue thrown in to set us up for a present day twist. Very poor and completely unneccesary. The original story stands alone on own merit and required no alterations. And alterations there were a few. I could be wrong, but I don't recall any exorcist style possesion in the book with eyes turning white.On the positive side it was mildly entertaining, but unfortunately won't be added to my dvd collection.

An alleged witch curses the Bell family after a land dispute, and over the ensuing years some form of spectral entity torments father John Bell (portrayed in convincing fashion by Donald Sutherland) and daughter Betsy Bell (played by Rachel Hurd-Wood). This isn't a movie for slasher fans, as it's quite mired in drama with the scary stuff often implemented in an atmospheric, subdued way. It's mostly set in that early 1800s period, although that story is bookended by beginning-and-end flashback sequences that, perhaps inexplicably to some, relate to the old tale.

""A New Yorker""","[0, 1]","I experienced performers in the form of Sissy Spacek and Donald Sutherland, but neither of these found this movie to be less than what I had hoped for. The story was good, and even included an ending that I would never have guessed. An American Haunting features two are able to lift it out of the ordinary. I'm not sure if it's just the part she's playing or what, but Spacek looks bored for most of the film; and while Sutherland has never been the liveliest actor, he doesn't look particularly enthused with his part either.The nineteenth century style of the film is the best thing about it, and director Courtney Solomon does succeed in giving the film an old style look and feel. I was disappointed in how they attempted to frighten you, mostly by having a window shatter at an unexpected moment, or some other loud noise pop out during a quiet scene. I honestly wanted to be frightened by it, but many of the scenes of possession came out quite comically. I nearly laughed out loud during a scene in which a girl was being slapped by an unseen entity. The way it was presented made it funny, not the actual content.I was angered slightly by one particular phenomena; the director seemed to be using a technique that I've only ever seen in TV series'. A ghostly incident occurred and caused one young girl much suffering, and then later on in the film, the exact same footage was reused, I suppose in an effort to convey how the hauntings happened often and eventually became a nightly affair. I found it to be a cheap move, and distracted me greatly from the mood of the film.Otherwise, I was slightly pleased with the film. As I said before, the story is solid and intriguing. The acting is up to par, and the general idea of each 'haunting' or 'possession' could have been frightening if experienced in real life, but on the screen it came off as half-baked and a bit comical.

Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek must have needed a payday real bad to appear in this clunker: parts of it are so unintentionally funny that they should cut and spliced into the next ""Scary Movie"" they make.The director, I guess, didn't realize that a lot of people have seen that movie ""The Exorcist"".  (Remember?  With Linda Blair?  Oh yeah!) The scene that was bust-a-gut-laugh-till-you-vomit was when the girl is picked up by her hair--you can actually see a wire or something for a minute--and dangled in the air.  It looked so unbelievably fake that I began to see this more as a comedy than anything else.  Is the entity so mad that it wants to glue the hair of young girls together (maybe a deleted scene has her waking up covered in spitballs).The ending, however, and what is implied about Sutherland's character is not one bit funny and struck me as unnecessarily morbid; also, the performances and general plotline before can't support an issue as serious as incest or child abuse.

1005153,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000GJ0NU2,Jonathan Appleseed,"[3, 3]","""An American Haunting"" starts out as many standard horror films do - with a teenage girl being chased by an unseen assailant. She is chased into her bedroom and waits while the assailant rattles at her door. As the rattling dies down, she approaches the door cautiously (always a wise move), and then an image of a very small but full-grown girl - that bears a startling resemblance to the girl from The Ring - appears next to her. She screams, only to find herself being shaken awake by her mother.Ah. Just a bad dream.Her mother confiscates a doll and some papers that her daughter found in the attic, goes down to the den and begins reading the papers, which announce that if anyone is reading them, then supernatural events must be occurring (or something along those lines).The papers go on to tell the story of the Bell Witch, as told in Brent Monahan's fictional horror novel, ""An American Haunting"".We move from the present day, with the mother knocking back a shot of Absolut as she prepares to read the stories, directly back into the early 19th century, Tennessee, to the home of John Bell. We find that he has committed the sin of usury by charging 20% interest on a sale of land (wouldn't it be great if 20% was considered, today, a sin??), and the woman to whom he sold the land, Kate Batts, may be a witch. She certainly acts like one, as she lays down what sounds to me like the granddaddy of smack-down curses on him.Almost immediately, strange things start to happen (actually, they started happening before the ""curse""...sounds like squirrels in the attic). His daughter, Betsy, is visited by what appears to be a rather angry poltergeist, as it drags her around the room by her feet, holds her suspended in air, and smacks her silly.Director Courtney Solomon, who brought us ""Dungeons & Dragons"", and ""Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God"", pulls out a bag of tricks that include black-and-white shooting when we are supposed to believe that another entity is in the room. It's not terribly convincing, and good actors like Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek fade into the background. Indeed, during one monologue, Sutherland gives what must be the worst performance of his life, which renders his character unbelievable.If we have difficulty believing in the human characters, it's going to be difficult to believe in the ""haunting"", ""poltergeist"", or whatever it is that's making poor Betsy's life so wretched.I kept waiting to shift back to modern time. We didn't until the very end. Those sequences were utterly unnecessary, as they lent nothing to the film.The conclusion was utterly unbelievable, though apparently not the fault of the filmmaker; rather, the fault lies with the author of the novel. I laughed. So did my roommate. It doesn't make ANY sense whatsoever, not when you go back and remember everything that poltergeist (or whatever) did - all of the attacks, the speaking, leaving the house, etc. One could argue my last example, but I know what the argument would be and I totally disagree with it. Unfortunately, I can't go into it because it would spoil the ending, such as it is.This gets two stars, where it might have received one. The cinematography - even the parts I would rather they have not included (black & white) - was quite good. Also, Sissy Spacek gave a strong performance, and even though Sutherland fell sharply for one monologue, he was more than adequate throughout the rest of the film.

I don't believe they used the same words and/or phrases that we use today, which is what took place here. Maybe the producer wanted to make the movie more palatable to the current movie watcher? Not sure. But the actual story wasn't followed, so why should the verbage be any different?What doesn't make sense here is that 'Betsy' was terrorized by the ghost first. Physically abused. The ending suggests that the 'ghost' and 'curse' were a result of her abuse by her father. If that were the case, why would she suffer the wrath of the haunting? Doesn't make sense.The final ending also leads one to believe that a sequel is on the way. I certainly hope not. I do like a good ghost story, however I don't consider this to be one of them... way too many flaws. I would hate to see them continue this saga for gratuitous measures only.There are much much better ghost stories out there that will give true chills. 'The Haunting'(original version), 'The Others' and 'The Changeling' are three top notch ghost stories. One would think with so much stellar quality scripts and such out there that hollywood would take heed and produce something really, truly scary.Good qualities of the movie are that the filming is good for the most part. (They really need to stop using the quick frame and change to black and white and back to color technique... really overdone). The sets look great as do the costumes. The acting was very good although they had a weak script to work with.Three stars all in all... but mostly because I think they churned this one out to be in time for halloween... not because they were serious.",3,It was ......

1005159,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000GJ0NU2,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 2]","Although there are plenty of other horror films out there that easily provide more scares than ""An American Haunting,"" this film stands on its own as a very good piece of Americana.  Firstly, it takes place when the United States was still a frontier land where new dangers and discoveries waited around every turn.  This is the perfect setting for a good, creepy tale not unlike Time Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow.""  Secondly, this story is based on factual events that still baffle historians and paranormal investigators to this day.  That cranks the ""creepy"" factor up a notch.  It's not a complete fabrication as was ""The Blair Witch Project,""  which so many have erroneously tried to compare this film to.  ""An American Haunting"" is much better than that drivel.  Finally, the cast is superb and culled from both rising newcomers such as Rachel Hurd-Wood (2003's ""Peter Pan"") and Thom Fell, solid actors such as James D'Arcy and reliable standards such as Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek.As stated before, this film is based on events that occurred in the early 1800's and lead up to the only officially recognized case of death as a result of supernatural events in the United States of America.  John Bell (Sutherland) loses a court case where he is found guilty of usuary.  He is ""cursed"" by his opponent in the case.  Not long after the trial, strange events begin to occur in and around the Bell home.  A black wolf seems to be terrorizing the family and a young girl haunts the Bell's daughter, Betsy (Hurd-Wood).  As the months roll by, the events become more bizarre and seem to be centered around Betsy.  She's dragged across her bedroom floor, violently slapped, has her hair pulled, is pinned in her bed, and frequently drifts off into coma-like states.  John begins to show symptoms of what appears to be TB and ages at a fascinating rate.  John Bell accuses the local supposed witch (who was also the beneficiary of his failings in court) of being the root of all of the Bell family's problems, but as the tale unfolds, we find that there is a much more sinister force at work.Director Courtney Solomon (""Dungeons and Dragons"") uses sound effects to perfection in this film.  The constant barrage of whispers, growls, grunts, and moans plays with the viewer's mind so much better than the gory thrills of most modern horror.  You are forced to imagine what is attacking the family.  Solomon is guilty of overusing black and white scenes, shifting focus, and, as another reviewer stated, the ""Evil Dead"" entity's point of view. However, it doesn't become too much of an annoyance as the film progresses.  I also agree with another reviewer that bookending the film with a modern setting doesn't seem to be necessary.  This story is good on its own without all of the extras.With all of this said, I'll have to give ""An American Haunting"" a solid three-and-a-half stars.  It's definitely a strong rental, and many fans of intelligent horror should consider this DVD as a purchase.",4,Hauntingly Good,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,2994,"['are', 'plenty', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'easily', 'provide', 'more', 'scares', 'American', 'Haunting', 'film', 'own', 'very', 'good', 'piece', 'Americana', 'Firstly', 'place', 'when', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'still', 'frontier', 'land', 'where', 'new', 'dangers', 'discoveries', 'waited', 'turn', 'perfect', 'setting', 'good', 'creepy', 'tale', 'not', 'Time', 'Burton', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'Secondly', 'story', 'based', 'factual', 'events', 'still', 'baffle', 'historians', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'day', 'creepy', 'factor', 'notch', 'not', 'complete', 'fabrication', 'was', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'erroneously', 'tried', 'compare', 'film', 'American', 'Haunting', 'much', 'better', 'drivel', 'Finally', 'cast', 'superb', 'culled', 'rising', 'newcomers', 'such', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', '2003', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Thom', 'Fell', 'solid', 'actors', 'such', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'reliable', 'standards', 'such', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Sissy', 'Spacek.As', 'stated', 'film', 'based', 'events', 'occurred', 'early', '1800', 'lead', 'up', 'only', 'officially', 'recognized', 'case', 'death', 'result', 'supernatural', 'events', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'John', 'Bell', 'Sutherland', 'court', 'case', 'where', 'found', 'guilty', 'usuary', 'cursed', 'opponent', 'case', 'Not', 'long', 'trial', 'strange', 'events', 'begin', 'occur', 'Bell', 'home', 'black', 'wolf', 'be', 'terrorizing', 'family', 'young', 'girl', 'Bell', 'daughter', 'Betsy', 'Hurd-Wood', 'months', 'roll', 'events', 'become', 'more', 'bizarre', 'seem', 'be', 'centered', 'Betsy', 'dragged', 'bedroom', 'floor', 'violently', 'slapped', 'hair', 'pulled', 'pinned', 'bed', 'frequently', 'drifts', 'off', 'coma-like', 'states', 'John', 'show', 'symptoms', 'what', 'be', 'TB', 'ages', 'fascinating', 'rate', 'John', 'Bell', 'local', 'supposed', 'witch', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'beneficiary', 'failings', 'court', 'being', 'root', 'Bell', 'family', 'problems', 'tale', 'unfolds', 'find', 'much', 'more', 'sinister', 'force', 'work.Director', 'Courtney', 'Solomon', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'sound', 'effects', 'perfection', 'film', 'constant', 'barrage', 'whispers', 'growls', 'grunts', 'moans', 'plays', 'viewer', 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'gory', 'thrills', 'most', 'modern', 'horror', 'are', 'forced', 'imagine', 'what', 'attacking', 'family', 'Solomon', 'guilty', 'overusing', 'black', 'white', 'scenes', 'shifting', 'focus', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'entity', 'point', 'view', 'However', ""n't"", 'become', 'too', 'much', 'annoyance', 'film', 'also', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'bookending', 'film', 'modern', 'setting', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'necessary', 'story', 'good', 'own', 'extras.With', 'said', ""'ll"", 'have', 'give', 'American', 'Haunting', 'solid', 'three-and-a-half', 'stars', 'definitely', 'strong', 'rental', 'many', 'fans', 'intelligent', 'horror', 'should', 'consider', 'DVD', 'purchase']",N/A

My first problem is that I went into this expecting to see some kind of haunted house/supernatural/demonic possession/exorcism type film, and in the beginning that's how it starts off. An old woman who may or may not be a witch curses John Bell and his daughter after he's not punished for the crime of usery (charging way too much interest) as she thinks he should be. Then, it got extremely interesting and very creepy after the hauntings begin and the curse seems to be happening to them right before their very eyes. I expected so many things from a showdown with the ""Bell Witch"" or an exorcism to free his home and his family of the ghosts, demons, or whatever kind of entities they were suppose to be. I got none of that. My second problem is the ending. You watch this poor little girl being constantly abused by this unseen force the entire movie only to find out there was no ""Bell Witch"", no ghosts, spirits, or even demons, but there was her rapist father, who raped her in the middle of the night while her mother was sleeping too hard to notice he had gotten up out of bed. I must admit, I do think he got what he deserved in the end, but that twist was not what I expected to see. However, if this is suppose to be based on a true story, or at least true events, I find it hard to believe this is the way the story ended. I'm assuming the ""Bell Witch"" is the name given to describe the events of this tale to the townspeople later on, or even the tourist that have heard about it. To be honest, I didn't hate this movie, but I didn't love it either. I do think it was good, but the previews were misleading because it turns out to be nothing that you were looking forward to seeing. I did get the ending though. I guess emotionally a part of a person would die if they were raped by their father and didn't remeber, but in reality that part wouldn't manifest itself in the form of a ghost and beat the crap out of you physically until you do remember.",3,Not what I expected!!,1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,2070,"['First', 'liked', 'movie', 'wan', 'na', 'say', 'first', 'However', 'do', 'have', 'couple', 'problems', 'My', 'first', 'problem', 'went', 'expecting', 'see', 'kind', 'haunted', 'house/supernatural/demonic', 'possession/exorcism', 'type', 'film', 'beginning', 'how', 'off', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'witch', 'John', 'Bell', 'daughter', 'not', 'punished', 'crime', 'usery', 'charging', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'interest', 'should', 'be', 'Then', 'got', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'very', 'creepy', 'hauntings', 'begin', 'curse', 'be', 'happening', 'right', 'very', 'eyes', 'expected', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'showdown', 'Bell', 'Witch', 'exorcism', 'free', 'home', 'family', 'ghosts', 'demons', 'kind', 'entities', 'were', 'suppose', 'be', 'got', 'none', 'second', 'problem', 'ending', 'watch', 'poor', 'little', 'girl', 'being', 'constantly', 'abused', 'unseen', 'force', 'entire', 'movie', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'there', 'was', 'Bell', 'Witch', 'ghosts', 'spirits', 'even', 'demons', 'there', 'was', 'rapist', 'father', 'who', 'raped', 'middle', 'night', 'mother', 'was', 'sleeping', 'too', 'hard', 'notice', 'had', 'gotten', 'up', 'bed', 'must', 'admit', 'do', 'think', 'got', 'what', 'deserved', 'end', 'twist', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'see', 'However', 'suppose', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'least', 'true', 'events', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'way', 'story', 'ended', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'Bell', 'Witch', 'name', 'given', 'describe', 'events', 'tale', 'townspeople', 'later', 'even', 'tourist', 'have', 'heard', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'do', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'previews', 'were', 'misleading', 'out', 'be', 'nothing', 'were', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'did', 'get', 'ending', 'guess', 'emotionally', 'part', 'person', 'would', 'die', 'were', 'raped', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'remeber', 'reality', 'part', 'would', ""n't"", 'manifest', 'form', 'ghost', 'beat', 'crap', 'physically', 'do', 'remember']",N/A

You're not beaten over the head with images of monsters, ghosts, or demons in this movie. If that is what you're looking for, this may not be your flick.Overall, it is well done and well made, but one has to pay attention to small details to reap all the intricacies of the plot. Perhaps it is because I've studied this case, but it did not present anything new and exciting to me. I was hoping for something more. However, the film did have some strong points such as the acting of Sutherland and Spacek and a second twist ending that left me with enough positives to balance out the negative of a ho-hum plot. That is my reasoning behind the 3 star rating.If you're looking for a quiet movie to watch on a dark and stormy night, this is probably your movie. If you're looking for something over the top full of gore and monsters, definitely look elsewhere because you'll be disappointed.",3,A fairly straightforward telling of the Bell Haunting,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,1499,"['American', 'Haunting', 'based', 'haunting', 'Bell', 'family', 'one', 'most', 'documented', 'hauntings', 'American', 'history', 'Many', 'theories', 'surround', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'haunting', 'film', 'one', 'become', 'most', 'prevalent', 'least', 'accounts', ""'ve"", 'read', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', ""'d"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'lend', 'touch', 'class', 'quite', 'horror', 'movie', 'Yes', 'haunting', 'images', 'are', ""n't"", 'horrific', 'action', 'overly', 'exaggerated', 'Many', 'most', 'horrific', 'concepts', 'film', 'are', 'cerebral', 'think', 'through', ""'re"", 'not', 'beaten', 'head', 'images', 'monsters', 'ghosts', 'demons', 'movie', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'flick.Overall', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'made', 'one', 'pay', 'attention', 'small', 'details', 'reap', 'intricacies', 'plot', 'Perhaps', ""'ve"", 'studied', 'case', 'did', 'not', 'present', 'anything', 'new', 'exciting', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'more', 'However', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'strong', 'points', 'such', 'acting', 'Sutherland', 'Spacek', 'second', 'twist', 'ending', 'left', 'enough', 'positives', 'balance', 'out', 'negative', 'ho-hum', 'plot', 'reasoning', '3', 'star', 'rating.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'quiet', 'movie', 'watch', 'dark', 'stormy', 'night', 'probably', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'top', 'full', 'gore', 'monsters', 'definitely', 'look', 'elsewhere', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

Such things can be difficult to put your finger on as to why, so all I can say is my pulse never went up a beat throughout. I didn't much care for Rachel Hurd-Wood in the lead. While she looks the part being as pretty as can be, she just couldn't play it. When she screams, she sounds like a spoiled brat having a temper tantrum rather than someone being physically assaulted. (or should I say spiritually assaulted) Of course, there is that dreaded ending that ruined the whole thing. I won't give it away, but it has two sides to it. Why they're being haunted and what's haunting them. The why is easily anticipated as you watch it, I can accept that. As for the what, you will never anticipate that because you've never heard of such a thing because It's just plain absurd. So much so it makes the idea of ghosts seem plausible and rational.

1005174,APOUYO1BEPK22,B000GJ0NU2,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[9, 11]","In 1817, John Bell loses some land he cleverly stole from a supposed local witch after the church told him to give it back. She still wasn't 100% happy so she cursed him and his precious daughter Betsy. Later, strange and violent occurrences begin to happen to Betsy. Then one night the whole family witnesses it and tries to ask for help from the local school teacher who quickly tries to play devil's advocate to each thing that happened. Until one day when he sees the violent and brutal attacks himself. Together the family and friends try to help Betsy through this terrible time. As they continue to help her, her father John starts to get attacked also, but from the inside. The only person they can think of who to blame is the local witch.The first time I saw this movie was on DVD, with a group of friends (which usually makes bad scary movies better for me), and I was half gone on the sauce. Passing out here and there during the movie kind of told me it was a bad movie. But I did catch the end, which I thought I must have been dreaming it. So tonight was the first time I really got to see this movie, and I was dreading it a little. That usually means if it is even remotely good, then I will like it a little bit. It wasn't. At all. Ok, maybe I'm being a little harsh here. The beginning part of the movie was ok. The first or second attack was pretty darn good. Holding Betsy up by her hair as she gets slapped around was pretty darn freaky. This ghost was pissed off for sure. And then the little things began to grind on me. The somewhat boring story. The 1 or 2 candles lighting a whole gigantic room like it had ceiling lights. People reading in the complete dark. The stupid wolf. Donald Sutherland's Nyquil acting. The changing of color to black and white during the ghost point of view scenes. The swooping camera during the ghost point of view scenes. And the coupe de grace of it all... the twist at the end. I could not believe it was put in there. And to top it off they had to recap some of the scenes for us to let us know how it happened, which made the whole story just feel absolutely absurd.The only things I remotely liked about this movie were three scenes. The hair pulling/slap scene, Betsy being dragged upstairs by her hair (man that ghost loved her hair), and the carriage flip. That carriage flip was awesome no matter how dumb the reason for it flipping was. I almost feel bad for giving this movie one star due to the fact at how cool that flip was.In the end I would highly recommend skipping this movie. The only reason I would think of to even see this movie would be to appreciate even the decent horror from other movies that Hollywood churns out at us.P.S. - They actually used CGI to make a letter look really old. Yep you read that right. Close to the beginning, in 1998 or whatever, the mom sees a letter and opens it. While she is holding it, you can see the outline of her fingers on the letter look like one of those green screen moments. This was within probably the first 4 minutes.

The family, with the help of their children's school teacher and other friends, repeatedly attempts to outwit the unseen forces that also seem to be driving their patriarch to the grave with a mysterious illness, but the solution proves to be as evasive as the true cause.Based upon actual events that resulted in the only official case of a death caused by a spirit in the United States, ""An American Haunting"" provides an intriguing if not very accurate account of the legendary Bell Witch haunting. If you are just seeking a ""spooky movie,"" you will likely be satisfied with this film. If you are seeking a realistic and historically precise take on the Bell Witch, you will likely be pretty frustrated. ""An American Haunting"" chooses to explain the supernatural events of the story with one of the many theories of the Bell Witch case. It's a fascinating but also rather slanderous one to be presented without historical evidence (if there truly IS any, I have not read of it). The film is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of quality. At times, the effects can feel like those of a TV movie, and there is a bookend storyline that takes place in modern day which I personally feel is entirely unnecessary and very ""Lifetime Network"" in style. The acting performances vary, but that is the case with most films, and with Sissy Spacek and Donald Sutherland in leads, you know there's some great acting to be enjoyed. On top of that, we get Rachel Hurd-Wood as Betsy, easily one of the most captivating and gorgeous actresses of our day. The film also creates an excellently haunting atmosphere, and is well worth at least one viewing from anyone who enjoys haunted house or exorcism themed films.Always choose the unrated versions.

The power of  ""The Amityville Horror"" is that years later many viewers still get creeped out every time they happen upon a Dutch Colonial house; at least in part due to supposedly factual content of the story behind the film.  ""Sleepy Hollow"" was simply the most stylish and lavish horror film ever, when the visuals were combined with its all-star cast the result was a viewing pleasure no matter how you felt about the quality of the actual story.""An American Haunting"" is set in rural Tennessee early in the 19th century.  John Bell (Donald Sutherland) and his wife Lucy (Sissy Spacek)  live on a farm with their two teenage children Betsy (Rachel Hurd-Wood of ""Peter Pan"" fame) and John Jr. (Thom Fell).John Sr. is accused  of usury (charging too high interest) and cursed by his accuser who may or may not be a witch.  The haunting then begins and features ghostly wolves, noises in the attic (squirrels maybe?), and the spectral appearance of a long-haired girl.  Things soon escalate as the angry spirit seemingly seeks to abuse/possess Betsy.The film is very loosely based on Brent Monahan's novel, ""The Bell Witch"", which was inspired by an actual historical event.  Fortunately Director Courtney Solomon follows horror film conventions and manages to work a fair amount of self-parody into the production, much as he did in his earlier film ""Dungeons & Dragons"".  This may disappoint those who are there only for a scare,  as the Hammer horror clich?s and overwrought histrionics work against the creepy factor.  You still get a nice package of scares for your money with some witty and campy stuff thrown in for diversion.Sutherland nicely overplays his character while Spacek grounds the film with a realistic take on the terror and bewilderment a god-fearing woman of those times would have experienced.  Hurd-Wood is fine but is not properly showcased as Solomon instead borrows (too heavily) the demon's point-of-view technique of  ""It Came From Outer Space"" and ""Evil Dead"".  There is simply too much devoted to staging the action from the sweeping POV of the unseen demon.There is a nice twist, much like the ending of ""Repulsion"", which you will probably guess while viewing or read about beforehand.Then again, what do I know?

1005195,A3VHUQ85RH0BC3,B000GJ0NU2,"Raj ""rajivsreviews""","[2, 2]","ABOUT THE MOVIE:The movie starts off with a young girl named Jane, who seems to be having nightmares. Her mother wakes her up and calms her down, and notices a journal and a doll in her daughter's room. She takes the items downstairs and begins to read the journal. The actual story of the movie now begins with the Bell family, consisting of John Bell, his wife Lucy, daughter Betsy, and their sons. They seem to have a normal life, until one night, when the family starts hearing noises in their home. What follows, is a series of strange unexplainable incidents, where Betsy and her father become the target for terror.PROS:Courtney Solomon did an amazing job in directing this movie. The mood throughout the movie was well paced, relying more on the performance of the actors and the story, rather than gory special effects and sudden noises (which is regular in today's horror flicks). The performance by the entire cast, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek and Rachel Hurd-Wood was amazing.CONS:The main reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating, was because the story wasn't clear enough. I had a hard time understanding the ending at first, and only after coming online and reading various message boards and forums on the movie, did I understand the events that led to the end. The point is, if I could depict why the events happened the way it did while watching the movie itself, then I would have enjoyed this movie much more. I guess a lot of others also had the same problem.Even after reading the others opinions on the movie, some scenes which I still find confusing are (if you haven't seen the movie, you don't have to read the questions, since they might contain spoilers):1. Why Betsy had to suffer in such a terrible way, just to remember what happened. Although I can somewhat understand why she had to, it still seems unfair.2. When John Bell Jr. and Richard are driving the carriage through the woods, with Betsy in it, why does the black wolf attack John Bell Jr.? If it is only trying to protect Betsy and seeking revenge on Betsy's father, why is Betsy's brother attacked for it? This part didn't make any sense.3. This might seem like a silly question to a few people, but why were Betsy's two twin brothers always sleeping in the movie? Weren't they even concerned as to what was happening to her? I found this to be a little creepy.DVD Features:This DVD does come with a few features, but they are a little short. One is an interview with director Courtney Solomon and Sissy Spacek, along with a few trailers and promos, and some deleted/alternate scenes (which actually do not add anything to the main movie, but are fun to watch anyway).All in all, I wouldn't say that this was the best horror movie released lately, but it is unique in its own way, and even though it seems confusing, the performance by the cast and the style of the movie could keep the viewer interested.",4,An interesting story with a confusing ending,1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,2900,"['THE', 'MOVIE', 'movie', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Jane', 'who', 'be', 'having', 'nightmares', 'mother', 'up', 'calms', 'down', 'journal', 'doll', 'daughter', 'room', 'items', 'downstairs', 'read', 'journal', 'actual', 'story', 'movie', 'now', 'Bell', 'family', 'consisting', 'John', 'Bell', 'wife', 'Lucy', 'daughter', 'Betsy', 'sons', 'seem', 'have', 'normal', 'life', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'family', 'hearing', 'noises', 'home', 'What', 'series', 'strange', 'unexplainable', 'incidents', 'where', 'Betsy', 'father', 'become', 'target', 'terror.PROS', 'Courtney', 'Solomon', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'directing', 'movie', 'mood', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'paced', 'relying', 'more', 'performance', 'actors', 'story', 'rather', 'gory', 'special', 'effects', 'sudden', 'noises', 'regular', 'today', 'horror', 'flicks', 'performance', 'entire', 'cast', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'was', 'amazing.CONS', 'main', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'was', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'enough', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'ending', 'first', 'only', 'coming', 'online', 'reading', 'various', 'message', 'boards', 'forums', 'movie', 'did', 'understand', 'events', 'led', 'end', 'point', 'could', 'depict', 'why', 'events', 'happened', 'way', 'did', 'watching', 'movie', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'guess', 'lot', 'others', 'also', 'had', 'same', 'problem.Even', 'reading', 'others', 'opinions', 'movie', 'scenes', 'still', 'find', 'confusing', 'are', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'read', 'questions', 'might', 'contain', 'spoilers', ':1', 'Why', 'Betsy', 'had', 'suffer', 'such', 'terrible', 'way', 'just', 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'can', 'somewhat', 'understand', 'why', 'had', 'still', 'unfair.2', 'When', 'John', 'Bell', 'Jr.', 'Richard', 'are', 'driving', 'carriage', 'woods', 'Betsy', 'why', 'black', 'wolf', 'attack', 'John', 'Bell', 'Jr.', 'only', 'trying', 'protect', 'Betsy', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'Betsy', 'father', 'why', 'Betsy', 'brother', 'attacked', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.3', 'might', 'seem', 'silly', 'question', 'few', 'people', 'why', 'were', 'Betsy', 'two', 'twin', 'brothers', 'always', 'sleeping', 'movie', 'Were', ""n't"", 'even', 'concerned', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'found', 'be', 'little', 'creepy.DVD', 'Features', 'DVD', 'come', 'few', 'features', 'are', 'little', 'short', 'One', 'interview', 'director', 'Courtney', 'Solomon', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'few', 'trailers', 'promos', 'deleted/alternate', 'scenes', 'actually', 'do', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'main', 'movie', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'anyway', '.All', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'best', 'horror', 'movie', 'released', 'lately', 'unique', 'own', 'way', 'even', 'confusing', 'performance', 'cast', 'style', 'movie', 'could', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interested']",N/A

1005197,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000GJ0NU2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[10, 16]","An American Haunting (Courtney Solomon, 2006)The first thing that needs said about this movie: someone shoot Caine Davidson before he is allowed to destroy any other movies. It is possible to make an argument that the awful, awful score of this movie-- the worst I've heard outside John Williams-- turned it from a piece of utterly mediocre filmmaking into something that was positively painful to sit through. I'm not sure how good an argument it is, but it's an argument.In order to make it, you have to buy that An American Haunting has any redeeming qualities. Okay, first off: it's a PG-13 horror film, something that no one has successfully pulled off since the introduction of the PG-13 rating. Second, you've got the script. Whether or not the script was any good mostly depends on how you feel about the actors involved, but there were some moments where a flash of dialogue, a word or a phrase, made me wonder if anyone had checked it for period authenticity; they were too modern to have been in common use at the time. And, of course, like most period pieces, it's overacted. (Why directors insist on actors in period pieces overacting is beyond me. I still wince watching John Malkovich chew scenery in Dangerous Liaisons.)Then there are the actors. Rachel Hurd-Wood is pretty easy on the eyes, but everyone involved with this production had to know that Hurd-Wood's performance would get compared to Jennifer Carpenter's in The Exorcism of Emily Rose; Hurd-Wood is Naomi Watts in The Ring compared to Carpenter's Naomi Watts in 21 Grams. There's simply no comparison between the two, and Hurd-Wood comes up short every time. Then there are Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek. Spacek's career was on the rocks for quite a few years, and it's understandable to see her taking roles like this and The Ring Two. Sutherland's presence here, on the other hand, is as baffling as can be. There are a few times in this film when he attempts to emote; all of them are somewhat painful. Not because he's acting effectively, quite the opposite. I can't tell whether he's amused at the script or simply embarrassed to be involved. Either way, the interplay between script and actors, especially Sutherland, provides a number of moments of unintentional hilarity.And if the thing is overacted, that's nothing compared to how it was handled behind the camera. Everything about this movie is over-something. The soundtrack, both with its hideous musical score and its consistent overblowing of sound effects and ambient sound both, is a travesty, and easily the worst thing about the film, despite the many other horrible things about it. And Solomon (who also directed Dungeons and Dragons; this should tell you all you need to know) is the kind of director who finds a special effect he likes and overuses it to ludicrous effect; I was actually pleasantly surprised that the nausea-inducing ghost's-eye-view was only used a few times (and only twice rushing down at the earth).But what really makes this from the amusing piece of trash Dungeons and Dragons was into the morally offensive pit of failure this movie is is the frame story. It's bad enough that the trailers seemed to suggest the movie took place equally in both times, but that might have at least been defensible; as it stands, it reeks of ""let's take an old story based on real human beings, twist it to our own ends, and then use it to come up with social-consciousness schlock in the final two minutes that would barely play on the Lifetime Movie Network!"" I'd be surprised, and I will be disappointed, if what living relatives John Bell has don't sue Courtney Solomon for every penny he has.I haven't seen a more offensive movie since The Day After Tomorrow; that one, however, at least had Jake Gyllenhaal to mitigate some of the utter disgust I felt watching it. This has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It is shameless, stupid, badly put together, manipulative, and possibly libelous. If you have a choice between spending eight dollars on this movie and eight dollars on sharp sticks with which to poke yourself in the eye, I cannot recommend highly enough that you spring for the sharp sticks.

I started wanting things to move along--not a good sign in a short (90 minute) movie. Overall though, I thought it was worth popping a bag of popcorn and curling up on the sofa for. Much better than I expected, given some of the really bad reviews.Actually, it looks to me as if most of the 1-star reviewers were upset because the movie wasn't faithful enough to the ""true"" story it was supposed to be based on.

Her mother discovers a book and starts to read about another girl in 1818 who had bad dreams in a case of a demonic curse. We then flash back to 1818 and the colonial frontier life of John Bell, a well to do rancher who built the local town church and school. He is found guilty of usury in a shady deal with his neighbor. The neighbor, who some say is a witch, wasn't happy with the outcome and apparently puts the whammy on John Bell. This is the head fake.Meanwhile, Bell's daughter Betsy is acting strange and invisible entities are haunting the Bell residence as doors open and close by themselves, people are pushed and dragged around, and of course the entity likes to remove the covers from a sleeping teenage girl and pin her to the mattress (no nudity in unrated version). Clearly these people have too much lead in their cooking utensils.  The local schoolmaster plays the skeptic. This type of stuff goes on ad nauseum to the point that John Bell goes over to the witch's house. He gives her a gun and points it at his head, and asks her to take his life to remove the curse. The witch claims she didn't put any curse on John Bell, that he did it himself.

So let's start with zero stars and go from there.Starting with the film itself: Decent acting all around. Decent special effects. Some nice camera work and cinematography. All in all, sets the right mood and delivers a polished output. +1 star for that.Now, for the script: Just awful. There was no plot to speak of. The same scene was repeated over and over again with little to no variation on the theme. The big ""surprise"" ending was completely anti-climactic because the characters were never developed enough for you to care one way or the other. Overall, just an absolutely boring story and an even worse script to boot. No points here.Finally, let's move to the special features: I can appreciate the way that director Courtney Solomon tries to be cutting edge by breaking away from the traditional director commentary and launching into a tirade against Hollywood. But, c'mon man. This was just ridiculous. In some ways, it's worth renting the movie just to see it for yourself. But, to summarize, he sits in a car with an unknown woman by his side and proceeds to bash movie critics and the entire film industry in general. He goes on to tell us how he planted his own reviews, or, worse, how he countered those that he felt were not ""legitimate"" (defined, I'm sure, as those reviews that did not agree with his own self-inflated opinion of this movie). And then he goes on to talk about how evil all movie critics are and how they can all essentially be bought. If this is true, why did the movie get such poor reviews? Since he obviously spent all sorts of money hiring his own internet crawlers, maybe he should have spent a few extra dollars to buy off a critic or two. I wonder if he would have said any of this stuff if any of those same critics had actually liked his movie. I hate hypocritical garbage from director's like this. Critics are worthless if they pan you, but they're Gods if they actually like your movie. Let's face it, movie critics represent the audience. Their purpose is to help us to make informed buying decisions. And, nine times out of ten, they do just that. All in all, his ranting and raving just confirmed that  the movie we just watched actually did stink. And the fact that he had nothing of substance to tell us about its creation, further confirms that fact.The one piece of worthy advice that Solomon does give us, I happen to agree with: Let the audience decide whether or not they like the movie.

1005225,A2RO40LIBUA67E,B000GJ0NU2,"Wayne Beckham ""Military vet, defense contacto...","[2, 5]","The film is very much in the mold of ""Sleepy Hollow,"" at least visually.  However the remoteness that provides for a lot of the unease of that movie is almost entirely overlooked in ""An American Haunting.""  This could have been made much more effective if the flight scene where, about two-thirds of the way through the movie, John and Betsy Bell seek to escape from the house, had instead been slightly retooled and used earlier in the film.  It's only very late in the film that you really get a sense of isolation and it's almost too late to add any chills.As others have commented, despite some major talents, the film didn't leave me with feeling that the actors were being used to their full abilities.  Sissy Spacek spent most of the film moon-eyed with fear (and she really does that better than anyone in Hollywood) but I would like to have seen more fire, particularly as the film begins to point to its entirely predictable pop-psychology conclusion.Other minor annoyances: The jump from present time to the Bell Witch past is jarring and unnecessary (in fact, it weakens the fright-factor as you've always got in the back of your mind that you're witnessing past events, instead of participating in them contemporaneously.)  The exaggerated ""American"" accents are at first amusing, but soon grow tiresome (I think the actors thought so as well as they start out sounding like so many inbred hillbillies, but by the end of the film their diction is more or less normal.)  The Darth Vader-like breathing of the ""witch"" POV wandering around the house, by reminding me of ""Star Wars,"" actually put me more at ease instead of heightening the tension.  And I think this movie revealed to me for the first time that school children were playing soccer in the 17th century!There were several interesting plotlines that were never really explored properly and could have been left out or at least explained a little better.  The relationship between the student and teacher; the possibility the much hated John Bell was the victim of spiteful neighbors, etc.  These devices were apparently thrown in to more firmly connect the film to the historic (and theoretically true) accounts of the Bell Witch, but they also served to divert your attention and let the air out of any building sense of dread.That said, while the movie wasn't the worst horror film I've ever seen, it certainly didn't live up to its potential or billing.  There were some frights but, as others have noted, entirely too many of them were the result of sudden really loud noises, instead of anything truly supernatural happening on the screen.",2,"No ""Sleepy Hollow"" Here",1158364800,"09 16, 2006",2006,2617,"['film', 'very', 'much', 'mold', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'least', 'visually', 'However', 'remoteness', 'lot', 'unease', 'movie', 'almost', 'entirely', 'overlooked', 'American', 'Haunting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'flight', 'scene', 'where', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'movie', 'John', 'Betsy', 'Bell', 'seek', 'escape', 'house', 'had', 'instead', 'been', 'slightly', 'retooled', 'used', 'earlier', 'film', 'only', 'very', 'late', 'film', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'isolation', 'almost', 'too', 'late', 'add', 'chills.As', 'others', 'have', 'commented', 'major', 'talents', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'feeling', 'actors', 'were', 'being', 'used', 'full', 'abilities', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'spent', 'most', 'film', 'moon-eyed', 'fear', 'really', 'better', 'anyone', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'fire', 'particularly', 'film', 'point', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'pop-psychology', 'conclusion.Other', 'minor', 'annoyances', 'jump', 'present', 'time', 'Bell', 'Witch', 'past', 'jarring', 'unnecessary', 'fact', 'fright-factor', ""'ve"", 'always', 'got', 'back', 'mind', ""'re"", 'witnessing', 'past', 'events', 'instead', 'participating', 'contemporaneously', 'exaggerated', 'American', 'accents', 'are', 'first', 'amusing', 'soon', 'grow', 'tiresome', 'think', 'actors', 'thought', 'so', 'as', 'well', 'start', 'out', 'sounding', 'so', 'many', 'inbred', 'hillbillies', 'end', 'film', 'diction', 'more', 'less', 'normal', 'Darth', 'Vader-like', 'breathing', 'witch', 'POV', 'wandering', 'house', 'reminding', 'Star', 'Wars', 'actually', 'put', 'more', 'ease', 'instead', 'heightening', 'tension', 'think', 'movie', 'revealed', 'first', 'time', 'school', 'children', 'were', 'playing', 'soccer', '17th', 'century', 'were', 'several', 'interesting', 'plotlines', 'were', 'never', 'really', 'explored', 'properly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'least', 'explained', 'little', 'better', 'relationship', 'student', 'teacher', 'possibility', 'much', 'hated', 'John', 'Bell', 'was', 'victim', 'spiteful', 'neighbors', 'etc', 'devices', 'were', 'apparently', 'thrown', 'more', 'firmly', 'connect', 'film', 'historic', 'theoretically', 'true', 'accounts', 'Bell', 'Witch', 'also', 'served', 'divert', 'attention', 'let', 'air', 'building', 'sense', 'dread.That', 'said', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'horror', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'billing', 'were', 'frights', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'entirely', 'too', 'many', 'were', 'result', 'sudden', 'really', 'loud', 'noises', 'instead', 'anything', 'truly', 'supernatural', 'happening', 'screen']",N/A

1005227,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,B000GJ0NU2,William R. Hancock,"[28, 32]","""An American Haunting"" is a film that can be evaluated to two levels; one, as a movie...an exercise in visual storytelling...with a beginning, a middle, and an end...and with rationales and explanations for what transpires in the course of its storyline; and , secondly, as a recounting of an historical event, with the evaluation being on how close to the known facts and ""truths"" of that event the movie story adheres to.As a movie, ""An American Haunting"" (based on a NOVEL; Brent Monahan's ""The Bell Witch-An American Haunting"") works rather well. Exquisitely photographed in Romania (doubling for early 18th century Tennessee) by Adrian Biddle, the film is replete with stunning tracking(some of this in the frenetic style of ""The Evil Dead"")and pan work, and some steadicam revolving shots that are nothing short of marvelous. The lighting is sumptuously atmospheric and all the other technical contributions, from editing, sound, sound effects,special effects, etc., are first rate. It has been said by some that this film has a lot of the look and feel of ""Sleepy Hollow"", and I must concur thereand state that this says a lot for ""Haunting"", since ""Sleepy Hollow's"" cinematic structure was superb.The acting performances in this film are superb as well. Donald Sutherland is terrific as the breaking-down-by-the-day John Bell, Sissy Spacek grounds it all stoically as mother Lucy, and Rachel Hurd-Wood is excellent as the put-upon by ""something"" Betsy Bell, the primary focus of the action. All other cast members deliver solidly in their own roles as well.The movie story is told in flashback as a modern mother, a Bell descendant, reads over a old manuscript that retells the story of the 1817-1820 poltergeist manifestation. The tale takes us back to when prosperous Tennessee farmer John Bell is taken to a church-council court over usury and swindling by a local woman, Kate Batts, who has a reputation for...maybe...being a witch of sorts. Bell is acquited of the land swindle charges, but judged guilty and reprimanded over the usury.Kate Batts is not satisfied with this outcome and lays a curse upon he and his household. Or so she says.Subsequently things start going weird and wild for the Bell family, with attacks by an invisible entity on daughter Betsy, the predations of a mysterious black wolf, and a string of telekinetic terrors on the family in general. The story line depicts the breakdown and death of John Bell (they have a ""reason"" for it...and a depiction of it...both taken from Monahan's novel rather than real-life) and the subsequent ""lifting"" (seemingly) of the curse. It then jumps back into the present and ends with the suspicion of a new ""Kate"" flare-up beginning...for the same reason the screenplay alledges/insinuates for the original incidents.The storyline goes full circle and ends on as threatening a note as it began with. Overall, a well-told tale. A nice, shivvery fright-fest, full of chills and free of over-the-top gratuitous blood and guts. And quite recommended by this reviewer.But how close to the truth of the real-life incident is the movie story?The answer? SOMEWHAT. The time period is right, the setting is right,the costuming and weaponry, and the OVERALL accounting of events as well...although considerably ""time-compressed"" to keep the flow of the story going. The stuff that is not true is the ""Church-Court"" hearing at the beginning wherein Bell was ""cursed"" by Batts(no such thing happened, Bell and Batts just had a long-standing fued over a business transaction...Kate Batts's name got dragged into the issue when the poltergeist started calling itself ""Kate"").The black wolf is a fiction, as is the chase through the woods in the coach, the coachwreck, and the flight through the woods on horseback with the wolf in pursuit. (In fact, the ""wolf"" element is a spin on the first recorded incident OF the Bell Witch Infestation...wherein John Bell was walking through his cornfield one day and saw something ""with the body of a dog and the head of a rabbit"" that he shot at to no avail). In the novel and movie script, something with the body of a dog and head of a rabbit would look ludicrous, so this mystery varmint got ""transformed"" into a black wolf instead. The little-girl phantom is a ""cook-up"" as well. And nowhere in this film are the little boys slapped and harassed, which WAS the case in real life. Betsy Bell was the PRIMARY focus of the harassment for a long time, but in real life ""Kate's"" animosities got quite spread around. The fact that the boys are NOT shown as being victimized in the film is because to do so would mitigate AGAINST the ""reason"" the filmmakers introduce later on to ""explain"" the manifestation.Also a fiction (based on pure, unsupported supposition by the book's author), is the film's ""true reason"" for the poltergeist attack. Thisrationale is extrapolated from the ""American"" notion of the origin of the phenomenon, which theorizes that there is a telekinetic projection from the unconscious mind of a stressed or disturbed individual...usually a pubescent female...that causes all such events. The British/European interpretation is more that stress and emotional strife (from any number of sources, including the rigors of puberty) can create energies that ""low spirit entities"" can utilize to manifest poltergeist activity. They base this on the fact that several notable poltergeist manifestations have involved no pubescent females whatsoever. Or anything else observably sexual in nature. Author Monahan obviously used this one theorized interpretation to ""juice"" his novel (somewhat with our present-day agenda concerns regarding child molestation), and the filmmakers followed suit because what works in literature with the public generally works in cinema as well...and sex ALWAYS sells.In truth, however, in no records ANYWHERE is there anything that indicates ANY kind of ""funny business"" between farmer Bell and his daughter. No suggestion of such appears anywhere, not even through insinuation. This supposed ""trigger"" for the Bell Witch seige comes purely from the imagination of Brent Monahan and nowhere else. As a story device it works, and it works WELL...but in legalese it ""assumes 'facts' not in evidence"". ( It might be of interest to know, though, that while there was, as stated above, NO mention of ""monkey business"" between father and daughter to be found in any contemporary commentaries on this matter, the same can NOT be said about schoolmaster Richard Powell...played in the movie by James D'Arcy. The movie plays Powell as the dashing ""secret admirer"" of Betsy Bell, a hero-figure who works to aid the family...and the covert object of his affections...in ridding themselves of the ""Bell Curse"". But some researchers of this case say that depiction may not be accurate at all; that there was plenty of talk that Master Powell, much older than Betsy Bell, rumoured a divorced man from another state, had a ""yen"" for the ""young stuff"" and Betts was the best looker around. These researchers say, talk was, that Master Powell himself might have dabbled in the ""Black Arts"" far more than Kate Batts ever did, and that he possibly set this ""entity"" loose on the Bells to give himself a ""foot in the door"" with them, to make him seem more of someone they could depend on in a crisis...as John Bell was suspicious of Powell's ongoing interest in Betsy. This interpretation would suggest that Kate Batts was ""framed"" and Powell was the true sorcerous culprit.In the end, in this scenario, John Bell got eliminated, Powell got Betsy, the family and community got largely hoodwinked, and Kate Batts ""took the fall"" for it all as a ""patsy"". Is this scenario anymore provable than the made-up book/movie one that makes John an incestuous child molester? No , but it at least demonstrates that there WAS another alternative possibility out there.)Still and all, we have a good movie here and that is what ultimately matters. Enjoy it for the great acting jobs it contains, the moody sounds and scenics, the great period costuming and make-up work, and the goose bumps it provides along the way.Recommended.",4,Stylish

Most of the credit goes to lovely young British actress Rachel Hurd-Wood who was by far the star of the film.  She played the part of the tormented teenage heroine perfectly.  Never did a girl scream or look scared like Rachel did in An American Haunting!  I will watch this DVD over and over again.  This is the best horror film that I have seen in many years!  Adorable Rachel has a very bright future ahead of her!  She was great in Peter Pan, but she put in an even better performance here!",5,Lovely Rachel Hurd-Wood was sensational in this film!,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,610,"['best', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'possibly', 'even', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Most', 'credit', 'lovely', 'young', 'British', 'actress', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'who', 'was', 'far', 'star', 'film', 'played', 'part', 'tormented', 'teenage', 'heroine', 'perfectly', 'Never', 'did', 'girl', 'scream', 'look', 'scared', 'Rachel', 'did', 'American', 'Haunting', 'will', 'watch', 'DVD', 'over', 'again', 'best', 'horror', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'Adorable', 'Rachel', 'very', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead', 'was', 'great', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'put', 'even', 'better', 'performance', 'here']",N/A
