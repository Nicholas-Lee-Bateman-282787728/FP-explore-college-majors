The jokes are more crude and ironic and not wishy-washy and oh so polite. Shelley Long is perfectly cast as Carol Brady, her comic timing is impeccable. The rest of the cast are a little bit over their heads, Christine Taylor is pretty good as superficial Marsha though. I didn't care for the first film, the sequel is much stronger and funnier. A mixed bag for me but enjoy!",3,"The first one is dumb, the second one is hilarious.",1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,489,"['Brady', 'Bunch', 'Movie', 'A', 'Very', 'Brady', 'Sequel', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'carbon', 'copy', 't.v', 'version', 'jokes', 'are', 'more', 'crude', 'ironic', 'not', 'wishy-washy', 'so', 'polite', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Carol', 'Brady', 'comic', 'timing', 'impeccable', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'heads', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'pretty', 'good', 'superficial', 'Marsha', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'first', 'film', 'sequel', 'much', 'stronger', 'funnier', 'mixed', 'bag', 'enjoy']",The Brady Bunch Movie / A Very Brady Sequel

750794,A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ,B00008Z45F,"R. Gorham ""RCG2""","[5, 6]","Shelley Long (as Carol), Gary Cole (as Mike) and Christine Taylor (as Marsha) were born to play these roles. The rest of the cast is great too (no-name Jan, Jennifer Cox, has some great lines and confused looks). Gary Cole nailed all of Mike Brady's mannerisms, voice inflections, and all around character to a flipping tee. Shelley Long was a great choice and she played the part of ever upbeat and quirky Carol beautifully. I couldn't have chosen two better actors to play Mike & Carol - these two performers knew their charactors like the back of their hands. For those of us who grew up in the late 1960's and 70's when the Brady's were on prime time TV - these movies are a great flashback. The Brady's are still stuck in their 70's time warp with all of America changing (1990's style) around them. The house interior and backyard scenes were just as I remembered them. While each of these movies are not deep or valuable as far as the material goes... the entertainment value in my book is still high. These 2 movies were just plain fun to watch and I found myself laughing out loud many times. The ""Sequel"" is equally good and just as funny. Cameos by most of the original cast and a few other stars including Michael McKean (Lavern & Shirley's ""Lenny"") and Davey Jones and The Monkees. DVD extras are minimal, but worth it on the low price alone.",4,30 years later...

The movie remakes were done well. The actors all looked very close to the original characters from physical appearances to the way they spoke and moved. The movies picked a bunch of the popular episodes and meshed them all in together into the movie on top of the main plots. They were a lot of fun to watch and are added to my collection of other Brady Bunch DVD's,5,Great remakes of the original series,1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,494,"['big', 'fan', 'original', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'series', 'watched', 'growing', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'watching', 're-runs', 'again', 'present', 'day', 'movie', 'remakes', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'actors', 'looked', 'very', 'close', 'original', 'characters', 'physical', 'appearances', 'way', 'spoke', 'moved', 'movies', 'picked', 'bunch', 'popular', 'episodes', 'meshed', 'together', 'movie', 'top', 'main', 'plots', 'were', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'added', 'collection', 'other', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'DVD']",The Brady Bunch Movie / A Very Brady Sequel
750796,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B00008Z45F,Twiddles42,"[4, 4]","Now I normally despise remakes of old tv shows, but the Brady Bunch movies are different - they don't ""do the same old thing"" with updated sets and characters nothing like the originals......they are the original characters surrounded by an updated reality.The movies are parodies of the tv show they pay homage to, but at themselves as well.  They are not a desire to modernize old characters that some dilettante dingbat thinks modern audiences would appreciate (hint, modern audiences DON'T), but the writers actually did something creative without losing the essence of the original characters.  They knew the charcters and how to fit the new style comedy.  They have the surreal spark that actually makes doing something with an old premise worthwhile.  And such a mix is a rare treat; that most tv-made-into-movies creators just cannot even begin to grasp.The movies themselves are a handful of vignettes from original TV episodes; but warped with modern day society - including puns that would otherwise be deemed vulgar, come off surprisingly inoffensive because these characters are still in the 1970s and the rest of the world is in 1995 (or 1996).Well, there are some differences - nobody expected the movie's writers to also incorporate the actual actors' behind-the-scenes moments into the movies as well; it has been said that the actors playing Marcia and Greg may have dated, so lo and behold the writers turn Movie Marcia and Movie Greg into doing it.  This is somewhat perverse, but because we all know it's a self-referential homage, the end result is more hilarious than vulgar.Of course, there are the DVDs themselves - the 5.1 Dolby sound is terrific, and the visual looks colorful and crisp, even if there are some periodic artifacting defects.  Nothing major.  And it's in 16:9 enhanced format, so I'm not going to complain.The DVD releases are solid, there's little that could be done to improve the quality, and it's a shame a third Brady movie was never made.  And it's a shame so many old-tv-to-movie shows are even given a first shot with their ""movies by numbers"" ineptitude.",5,Why didn't they make a third!!!,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,2105,"['Now', 'normally', 'despise', 'remakes', 'old', 'tv', 'shows', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'movies', 'are', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'same', 'old', 'thing', 'updated', 'sets', 'characters', 'nothing', 'originals', 'are', 'original', 'characters', 'surrounded', 'updated', 'reality.The', 'movies', 'are', 'parodies', 'tv', 'show', 'pay', 'homage', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'not', 'desire', 'modernize', 'old', 'characters', 'dilettante', 'dingbat', 'modern', 'audiences', 'would', 'appreciate', 'hint', 'modern', 'audiences', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'writers', 'actually', 'did', 'something', 'creative', 'losing', 'essence', 'original', 'characters', 'knew', 'charcters', 'how', 'fit', 'new', 'style', 'comedy', 'have', 'surreal', 'spark', 'actually', 'doing', 'something', 'old', 'premise', 'worthwhile', 'such', 'mix', 'rare', 'treat', 'most', 'tv-made-into-movies', 'creators', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'begin', 'grasp.The', 'movies', 'are', 'handful', 'vignettes', 'original', 'TV', 'episodes', 'warped', 'modern', 'day', 'society', 'including', 'puns', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'deemed', 'vulgar', 'come', 'off', 'surprisingly', 'inoffensive', 'characters', 'are', 'still', '1970s', 'rest', 'world', '1995', '1996', '.Well', 'are', 'differences', 'nobody', 'expected', 'movie', 'writers', 'also', 'incorporate', 'actual', 'actors', 'behind-the-scenes', 'moments', 'movies', 'well', 'been', 'said', 'actors', 'playing', 'Marcia', 'Greg', 'may', 'have', 'dated', 'lo', 'behold', 'writers', 'turn', 'Movie', 'Marcia', 'Movie', 'Greg', 'doing', 'somewhat', 'perverse', 'know', 'self-referential', 'homage', 'end', 'result', 'more', 'hilarious', 'vulgar.Of', 'course', 'are', 'DVDs', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'sound', 'terrific', 'visual', 'colorful', 'crisp', 'even', 'are', 'periodic', 'artifacting', 'defects', 'Nothing', 'major', '16:9', 'enhanced', 'format', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'complain.The', 'DVD', 'releases', 'are', 'solid', 'little', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'improve', 'quality', 'shame', 'third', 'Brady', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'shame', 'so', 'many', 'old-tv-to-movie', 'shows', 'are', 'even', 'given', 'first', 'shot', 'movies', 'numbers', 'ineptitude']",The Brady Bunch Movie / A Very Brady Sequel
