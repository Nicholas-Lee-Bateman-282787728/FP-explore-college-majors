The acting is better, the characterizations more believable, and some of the dialogue I would put in a class with Shakespeare and Lois Bujold.  The remake merely has a bigger budget, so the picture quality is better.But it is as a *story* that this movie shines, for we are shown the world through the eyes of a young girl just on the leading edge of her womanhood, thrown into immortal peril, and given both a terrible choice and a great responsibility.  Winnie and all the  Tucks are brought to vibrant life, and we can empathize with each of them, and the joys and burdens their unwanted gifts bring them.I mentioned dialogue earlier, and to this day I cannot think about Jesse Tuck's reply to the Sheriff's warning without shivering at just how profound that reply is. For that exchange alone, I would watch this movie again and again.I hope and pray that THIS edition finally finds its way to DVD, where it, like the Tucks, may live forever.",5,Joy Everlasting,1067558400,"10 31, 2003",2003,1011,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'remake', 'far', 'better', 'acting', 'better', 'characterizations', 'more', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'would', 'put', 'class', 'Shakespeare', 'Lois', 'Bujold', 'remake', 'merely', 'bigger', 'budget', 'picture', 'quality', '*story*', 'movie', 'are', 'shown', 'world', 'eyes', 'young', 'girl', 'just', 'leading', 'edge', 'womanhood', 'thrown', 'immortal', 'peril', 'given', 'terrible', 'choice', 'great', 'responsibility', 'Winnie', 'Tucks', 'are', 'brought', 'vibrant', 'life', 'can', 'empathize', 'joys', 'unwanted', 'gifts', 'bring', 'them.I', 'mentioned', 'dialogue', 'earlier', 'day', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'Jesse', 'Tuck', 'reply', 'Sheriff', 'warning', 'shivering', 'just', 'how', 'profound', 'reply', 'exchange', 'alone', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'again.I', 'hope', 'pray', 'THIS', 'edition', 'finally', 'way', 'DVD', 'where', 'Tucks', 'may', 'live', 'forever']",Tuck Everlasting 1981  VHS

It seems to be a simpler story with out the over-acting.  They never show it on TV so I had to get it.

352813,AADA02KT2O6I8,6303047548,wholeo,"[0, 1]","I only have one question & one complaint about the original (& for all that matter, the only one, as the remake is nothing close to this gem...no offense to those who participated in its making...but there are some movies, such as ""It's a Wonderful Life"", that should never be remade unless they intend to spend the denarii necessary to keep essentially the same as the original...well, for that matter, they should just never be remade. The disaster of ""Miracle on 34th St"" is a primary example.  And so is this film. I haven't seen it since the 80's or early 90's as the VHS got lost somewhere along the road of moving from WI to WA twice & a divorce after 24 yrs & well, you get the pic.  But when I watched the remake (at the time I didn't really notice b/c I was just so thrilled to see the movie) it didn't take long to realize something was rotten in Denmark, & it wasn't tomatoes. Only then did I look at the details of the cover to realize in horror (but also a relief b/c i realized i wasn't going nuts afterall...at least not yet...that there was an original that was really good) that this was a remake.So, back to my question & complaint.  There both one in the same. And that is, when is this coming out on DVD? That's all folks.Oh. PS. To those who compare movies to the books & complain about how hey fail dramatically to stay true to the text, I believe years of experience should have taught us by now that with a very few exceptions, on very rare occasions does a movie stand up w/it's book.  Having said that I believe the reason(s) is/are simple.  We are using different sensory inputs to our brains. I know that may seem too simplified but hey, i'm blessed w/ADHD & if there's one thing i've learned about that, is that i tend to look at things differently than normsies.  If i go to a movie after reading the book & have some sort of expectation of it staying on course with the book, then i've already lost the whole reason for going to the movie in the 1st place...and that's to have fun! I let my brain relax so i can get into the movie & enjoy the ride. And if i find myself still standing at the train station 1/2-way thru the movie, it's either b/c I had some sort of expectations on the movie, which leads me to look for certain things in the movie, which leads me to missing key parts or much of the movie b/c I'm in hyper-focus, super-frustrated mode & then to add insult to injury i will realize, & wonder, why i just wasted money on the movie, which also means i will be even more frustrated if i have to pay to go back & rewatch it to try & find what i missed, or just complain that it was a lousy movie, not placing the blame where it really belongs...solely square on my shoulders...you get the picture.  Either wait to read the book, or if too late, just forget you read it & enjoy the movie, especially if your taking kids!  It's like riding on a Harley & then getting into a VW Thing & basing your experience by comparing the 2...i don't know if that came out right by i hope u get my drift...Go w/o any expectations, like it's a whole different ride,  If you're really into reading (which i wish we did more but that's a whole other story), then think of your reading as a Cadillac, a Lincoln Continental, a Rolls Royce (in fact, if you want a little history lesson w/Rolls Royce, read what they had to learn from their experience of trying to do to the the GM Turbo-hydromatic 400 transmission what they did to their engine.  i'll help you along.Rolls Royce machines their engine parts so close in tolerance that they don't need or use gaskets. Everything fit so tight.  So they figured when they started to use the GM TH-400 automatic transmission in their cars, they decided to do the very same thing...machine everything so close in tolerance that they wouldn't need gaskets.  Problem is, automatic transmission have internal leakage built into them for a reason. So when they put it all back together & started it up & tried to drive, well, instead of a nice smooth drive, they were jolted in their seats.So you see folks, when you're going to the movies, just remember what you drove up in, & when you walk thru the doors of the theater, think about them as the doors to your new vehicle...what kind of car do you want to watch...or what the hey...what kind of car do you want to see yourself driving in the movie?  When you go to a James Bond movie, are you seeing if it stays true to the book, or are you imagining yourself behind the wheel of that Astin-Martin?  Sorry, but when i'm watching a movie i don't have time to think about the book. that's for after the drive, when you & your spouse & the kids talk about it & have some...quality time with them...find out what they were driving during the movie. But if you're too busy thinking about the book during the movie, you'll find yourself frustrated, angry, jealous b/c you're missing out on the fun your kids & wife are having talking about the movie, & when they ask you, you'll find yourself muttering ""I can't talk now, i'm driving...!"" w/that, i'm outta here...go see this movie...oh and uh...leave your book back in the Mercedes & get ready to go dirt biking, or even a scooter! Just get out of the car! & if u got kids, don't forget the helmets! ;-D",5,Only one ?,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,5261,"['only', 'have', 'one', 'question', 'one', 'complaint', 'original', 'matter',
