751824,A4VH04TA14CPE,B000094J5Q,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[1, 2]","This film looks beautiful. The colours are so bright and vibrant, they make the setting look unreal. This impression is even stronger when the camera stays absolutely still, like for instance in that one shot of the elevator coming down to the laboratory. Every surface looks perfectly smooth, it's like the walls and sky have no texture, the elevator makes a steady descent in what sounds like total silence, and the image comes across as some kind of abstract composition rather than as a depiction of real events. Then, when they reach the chamber where the light travels through the water, the starlike sparkling produces a very similar effect. In another scene, when the camera follows some seagulls that are circling around a fishing boat, it moves in a way that makes the birds look frozen in the air, immobile. I don't know if the director used many special effects, or his personal aesthetic just has this air of artificiality, but the visual style of the film is somewhat disconcerting.But that actually fits well with the plot, in which a harried salaryman leaves his job and his family and visits a seaside town, where he falls in love with a woman who has a most peculiar health condition. I won't reveal it here, because it's just too delightful to spoil. Suffice it to say that the man quickly decides to prolong his stay, but then he has to deal with various rumours regarding the woman's past, and some reminders of her previous lovers. It's not that the other villagers dislike her, but she lives in a world of her own, apart from them; when she goes to visit the protagonist at work, it's like she doesn't even notice anyone else there.Of course, the film hinges on the role of the heroine. The only way it could maintain its tone is through someone who can be completely out of the ordinary, without trying. In her performance, the lead actress finds the perfect way to do this: she isn't really beautiful, but she's very feminine (notice how she only wears skirts) and she can portray a state of complete, unconstrained joy. This is why the adjective ""delightful"" is appropriate for describing her ""condition."" There is something about her that suggests a personification of nature. No wonder the protagonist has a dream about returning to the womb; the woman is somewhere between lover and mother. The recurring shot of the trickle of water as it makes its way to the river seems to hint at some idea of purification or soothing.This doesn't really begin to describe just how much oddity there is in this film. There are quirky and light-hearted scenes, but the film as a whole is not really a comedy. For example, there's a scene in the second half that suddenly explodes in completely unexpected, cruel violence, when the protagonist tries to fight the drug dealer, although the shock is quickly diffused with just about the most awesome comeuppance that I've ever seen in a film. Here and in other moments, it becomes evident that the village isn't a very friendly place to live in; if it weren't for the woman, the protagonist would be just as lost there as he was in Tokyo. There's a sadder undercurrent running through the plot, perhaps best expressed when the woman says, with her usual good cheer, ""I thought the twenty-first century would be different!""Other parts are just bizarre. There's a brief flashback about the death of the heroine's mother. In sharp contrast to the rich, clean colours of the rest of the film, this scene is filmed in grainy black-and-white. The story is told in a stylized, melodramatic way, but then when the camera cuts back to the main characters, they take it pretty lightly and have fun throwing stones into the river. This whole subplot is then never alluded to again. Does this scene mean to argue that it is absurd to dwell on disasters of the distant past, or does it mean nothing at all?I have to say, the ending left me puzzled. Was she really faithful to the protagonist (and to those that came before him), or not? In her speech towards the end, she says that the only reason why they suspected her of infidelity was because her ""condition"" began to lose some of its intensity. This is interesting, because it casts the situation in another light: they became so obsessed with the ""condition"" that they were unable to love her. She has a point; throughout the film, not much conversation really occurs between her and the protagonist. However, even as she says this, she adds, ""You're all the same,"" a bitter and knowing remark that could be interpreted in multiple ways. The discussion then turns to other subjects, and they don't return to this issue, so it's impossible to tell whether her story is true. But, after all, we do see her go for a ride with the drug dealer; I don't know, maybe I misread something here, but I thought that the latter implied that he frequently used her in this manner. And as she drives home afterwards, the expression on her face is remarkably ambiguous, she looks much more withdrawn and melancholy than her usual self. Is that because she accepted his offer? And of course, all the guys that talk to the protagonist insinuate that she has had many lovers. So, all the time, it is constantly implied that there's more to her past than what she tells the protagonist.Well, in that sense, I suppose the film is very effective in showing how bewildering it is when a man has no way of knowing whether or not his sweetheart is speaking the truth when she says she loves him. But then again, maybe the last shot means that it doesn't matter, because such things are ultimately irrelevant to nature.",5,"to touch, to taste; she flows like a river",1130630400,"10 30,

751825,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B000094J5Q,darragh o'donoghue,"[40, 49]","A sublimely skewered shaggy-dog sex comedy from Shohei Imamura that takes up where Edward Yang's sober 'Yi-Yi' left off, and pulls it into a completely unexpected direction.  Like Yang's film, Imamura's protagonist, Yosuke Sasano, is a computer programmer in crisis (in this case his business has gone under); he now spends his time being insulted by his horrid, hectoring wife on the phone, and living with river-side tramps.  Like Yang's film, Imamura diagnoses the spiritual void at the heart of Far Eastern super-corporate economic success - one very Yang-like shot views Yosuke attending an interview from behind a chillingly impersonal window; the distance between viewer and protagonist makes his desperate grovelling to the Kafkaesque manager all the more pathetic - but his prescription couldn't be more different.Initially, the film seems as methodical and meticulous in composition and tone as we would expect from a severe Oriental master, with complicated, multi-level, multi-frame compositions (the geometry of character groupings imposed on the geometry of place - see the triangle of friends overlooking the corpse in his tent in the opening sequence) staged thoughtfully for a static camera that picks out only the essential elements of each image.  This staticness doensn't mean each shot is devoid of internal tension - for instance, the opening tracking long-shot that follows the policemen in the direction of the hut, works against the movement of the river, and is a brilliant, if wrong-footing visual introduction of the film's themes (the disjunction and perversion of the natural in modern life etc.).  But even startling comic upsets - such as the collapse of the makeshift roof under which his friends toast the dead man when one of them drunkenly knocks over a beam - doesn't prepare us for the bizarre sidetracks the plot will soon take.The dead man, Taho, was an ex-con who spent decades in his river hut reading the world's classics; Yosuke shared many hours with him when he was supposed to be looking for jobs, with Taro encouraging him to ditch his cripplingly submissive conformity and search for true love.  Just before he died, he told him that he had left a stolen treasure in the house of a former lover in a far-flung seaside town, which he was welcome to take if he could find it.  Broke and unemployed, Yosuke sets off, and follows the lady of the house, Saeko, to a local supermarket, where she breaks water and shoplifts.  It emerges she has a 'problem' with welling internal water that can only be vented by kleptomania or lovemaking.  Yosuke takes a job with the local fisherman's son, and is on call for whenever Saeko needs him.  But when he falls for her, is it for herself or the life-giving water which gushes into the adjacent river, attracting all the fish?Yosuke's journey from the rather glum order of Tokyo to the weird logic of the seaside town is like the move from the Victorian age to Wonderland in Lewis Carroll's famous book.  Yosuke wanders the town, populated by eccentrics whose actions seem more determined by whim and desire than the fixed expectations he's used to, like a bemused Alice, in his case being slowly sucked in by the town's seductive call, and suffering some very odd dream sequences.  Imamura's tone changes completely - the music becomes circus-like playful, the staging of scenes, the clash between rigorous framing and nutty events, increasingly absurd (see the wonderfully coy **lla**o sequence).  This mode undercuts what seems to be a very middle-aged male fantasy - the spiritual regenration through sex of a hen-pecked husband.  And when you think about it, the town isn't that much of a haven - racist, riven with small-scale organised crime and the legacy of industrial pollution, and full of visual evidence of economic delapidation.  But Imamura's eye for the meaningful image of location with which to frame his dense, ambivalent compositions never wavers, and his sensitivity to labyrinthine interiors, natural light or water (the deflection of dissolving light from the river onto buildings is particularly beautiful) or delicious colour-coding (those reds!) is as true as ever.",5,The most unexpected and glorious comedy in ages.,1021248000,"05 13, 2002",2002,4176,"['sublimely', 'skewered', 'shaggy-dog', 'sex', 'comedy', 'Shohei', 'Imamura', 'up', 'where', 'Edward', 'Yang', 'sober', ""'Yi-Yi"", 'left', 'off', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'direction', 'Yang', 'film', 'Imamura', 'protagonist', 'Yosuke', 'Sasano', 'computer', 'programmer', 'crisis', 'case', 'business', 'gone', 'now', 'time', 'being', 'insulted', 'horrid', 'hectoring', 'wife', 'phone', 'living', 'river-side', 'tramps', 'Yang', 'film', 'Imamura', 'spiritual', 'void', 'heart', 'Far', 'Eastern', 'super-corporate', 'economic', 'success', 'one', 'very', 'Yang-like', 'shot', 'views', 'Yosuke', 'attending', 'interview', 'chillingly', 'impersonal', 'window', 'distance', 'viewer', 'protagonist', 'desperate', 'grovelling', 'Kafkaesque', 'manager', 'more', 'pathetic', 'prescription', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different.Initially', 'film', 'methodical', 'meticulous', 'composition', 'tone', 'would', 'expect', 'severe', 'Oriental', 'master', 'complicated', 'multi-level', 'multi-frame', 'compositions', 'geometry', 'character', 'groupings', 'imposed', 'geometry', 'place', 'see', 'triangle', 'friends', 'overlooking', 'corpse', 'tent', 'opening', 'sequence', 'staged', 'thoughtfully', 'static', 'camera', 'out', 'only', 'essential', 'elements', 'image', 'staticness', ""n't"", 'mean', 'shot', 'devoid', 'internal', 'tension', 'instance', 'opening', 'tracking', 'long-shot', 'policemen', 'direction', 'hut', 'movement', 'river', 'brilliant', 'wrong-footing', 'visual', 'introduction', 'film', 'themes', 'disjunction', 'perversion', 'natural', 'modern', 'life', 'etc.', 'even', 'startling', 'comic', 'upsets', 'such', 'collapse', 'makeshift', 'roof', 'friends', 'toast', 'dead', 'man', 'when', 'one', 'drunkenly', 'over', 'beam', ""n't"", 'prepare', 'bizarre', 'plot', 'will', 'soon', 'take.The', 'dead', 'man', 'Taho', 'was', 'ex-con', 'who', 'spent', 'decades', 'river', 'hut', 'reading', 'world', 'classics', 'Yosuke', 'shared', 'many', 'hours', 'when', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'looking', 'jobs', 'Taro', 'encouraging', 'ditch', 'cripplingly', 'submissive', 'conformity', 'search', 'true', 'love', 'Just', 'died', 'told', 'had', 'left', 'stolen', 'treasure', 'house', 'former', 'lover', 'far-flung', 'seaside', 'town', 'was', 'welcome', 'take', 'could', 'find', 'Broke', 'unemployed', 'Yosuke', 'off', 'lady', 'house', 'Saeko', 'local', 'supermarket', 'where', 'water', 'shoplifts', ""'problem"", 'welling', 'internal', 'water', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'vented', 'kleptomania', 'lovemaking', 'Yosuke', 'job', 'local', 'fisherman', 'son', 'call', 'whenever', 'Saeko', 'when', 'life-giving', 'water', 'adjacent', 'river', 'attracting', 'fish', 'Yosuke', 'journey', 'rather', 'glum', 'order', 'Tokyo', 'weird', 'logic', 'seaside', 'town', 'move', 'Victorian', 'age', 'Wonderland', 'Lewis', 'Carroll', 'famous', 'book', 'town', 'populated', 'eccentrics', 'actions', 'seem', 'more', 'determined', 'whim', 'desire', 'fixed', 'expectations', 'used', 'bemused', 'Alice', 'case', 'being', 'slowly', 'sucked', 'town', 'seductive', 'call', 'suffering', 'very', 'odd', 'dream', 'sequences', 'Imamura', 'tone', 'changes', 'completely', 'music', 'circus-like', 'playful', 'staging', 'scenes', 'clash', 'rigorous', 'framing', 'nutty', 'events', 'increasingly', 'absurd', 'see', 'wonderfully', 'coy', '**lla**o', 'sequence', 'mode', 'what', 'be', 'very', 'middle-aged', 'male', 'fantasy', 'spiritual', 'regenration', 'sex', 'hen-pecked', 'husband', 'when', 'think', 'town', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'haven', 'racist', 'riven', 'small-scale', 'organised', 'crime', 'legacy', 'industrial', 'pollution', 'full', 'visual', 'evidence', 'economic', 'delapidation', 'Imamura', 'eye', 'meaningful', 'image', 'location', 'frame', 'dense', 'ambivalent', 'compositions', 'never', 'wavers', 'sensitivity', 'labyrinthine', 'interiors', 'natural', 'light', 'water', 'deflection', 'dissolving', 'light', 'river', 'buildings', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'delicious', 'colour-coding', 'reds', 'as', 'true', 'ever']",N/A

I give it five stars because I really think this is a very good film, and more importantly, it's so darn different from so many other films I have seen. I really like the acting of Koji Yakusho, and I wish more of his films were accessible here in the west. In fact, I would like to see him in more films. I think he is an incredible and underated actor in Japan. The film is a very strange one. The film starts with Yosuke Sasano (Koji Yakusho) being let go of the firm he works, and wondering where he will find a job at his age.One of his friends is named Taro, who is a homeless old man, and he likes to revel in tales of his past youth. In one of these stories, and before his death, he tells Yosuke about a treasure of gold that he hid in a house near the sea in Noto. The treasure is near a red bridge. Out of work, with no idea as to when he will work again, Yosuke decides to leave Tokyo in search of this hidden gold. However, he comes across someone who has a very strange problem. The house where the gold is supposedly hidden also is the very house where this strange beautiful woman lives. Her name is Saeko (Misa Shimizu).I don't want to give away her problem, as this will ruin part of the story for you, and the film. However, I will say that her problem is of a sexual nature. But the way it is treated is very hilarious and I might add, done in a happy sort of way. The Saeko's grandmother also lives in the house with her, and she is waiting for the man who left her, and promised to come back. However, that man was Taro, the homeless man who has since died.

Yosuke travels to a small, seaside town and finds a house where the statue is supposedly hidden.  Before he can step inside, he spies a young woman hurrying from the house located beside a red bridge and for some reason, follows her to the market.  There, he watches her shoplift some cheese while she stands in a puddle of water.When the two eventually meet, he learns of her secret affliction: that she fills with water.  The only way to release the water is through sexual release.  Soon, Yosuke abandons his treasure hunt, finds a job as a fisherman and sees more and more of the young woman.I admit that I thought this an intriging story.  A woman who fills with water and can only release it through sex.  A great idea.  But, this movie confused me.  I didn't know if I were watching a comedy or a drama.  It starts of very heavy, with the state of unemployment, Yosuke's wife who nags and demeans, the death of Yosuke's friend.  but when Yosuke and the young woman have sex for the first time and the water bursts out, this funky Japanese music starts playing, giving the impression of a bad 1970s soft-core movie.

It's kinda like life!Yasuke (played by the always likable Koji Yakusho) is an unemployed salaryman visiting his hobo/philosopher buddy, Taro, while away from home on a job interview. Taro dies, but his tall tales of treasure in a small village home compel Yasuke to investigate. The house is near a red bridge...To make a long story short; Yasuke finds the red bridge, and the house, and a beautiful woman living there, Saeko (played by the erotically coy Misa Shimuzu) and a torrid and, ahem... unusual affair begins.A wild cast of characters, bizarre circumstances, and comical situations play throughout the film, but one thing I really enjoyed was the almost Herzog like physicality of this film. It somehow drives home the life affirming purity of sex. I noticed it from the first moment Yasuke reaches that beautiful red bridge and slaps his hand solidly on the railing. Yasuke gets a job as a fisherman (very physical work) and pulls up nets full of big tuna, he outruns an African Olympic runner (who is training w/ his Japanese coach throughout the film) to be with Saeko. Yakusho gives a very lively and physical performance against Imamura's bright and colorful palette. This is in sharp contrast to the job interview scene and the scene with the nagging phone call from Yasuke's hateful wife, which are shot behind sterile, impersonal panes of glass.I could go on and on about the complex story and hilarious setups, but I encourage you to read all the other reviews and of course watch the film for yourself. With so much either ugly or boring sex in TV and cinema it's nice to see a film that depicts the act in a fun and life affirming manner.",5,Imamura's best!,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,2031,"['Mr.', 'Darragh', ""O'Donoghue"", 'review', 'pretty', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'add', 'voice', 'chorus', 'praise', 'try', 'lift', 'one', '5', 'star', 'status', 'Imamura', 'complicated', 'multi-layered', 'films', 'where', 'drama', 'so', 'involved', 'intentions', 'characters', 'can', 'sometimes', 'get', 'muddled', 'crucial', 'plot', 'points', 'often', 'pop', 'up', 'much', 'later', ""'re"", 'used', 'kinda', 'life', 'Yasuke', 'played', 'always', 'likable', 'Koji', 'Yakusho', 'unemployed', 'salaryman', 'visiting', 'hobo/philosopher', 'buddy', 'Taro', 'away', 'home', 'job', 'interview', 'Taro', 'tall', 'tales', 'treasure', 'small', 'village', 'home', 'compel', 'Yasuke', 'investigate', 'house', 'red', 'bridge', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'Yasuke', 'red', 'bridge', 'house', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'living', 'there', 'Saeko', 'played', 'erotically', 'coy', 'Misa', 'Shimuzu', 'torrid', 'ahem', 'unusual', 'affair', 'begins.A', 'wild', 'cast', 'characters', 'bizarre', 'circumstances', 'comical', 'situations', 'play', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'almost', 'Herzog', 'physicality', 'film', 'home', 'life', 'affirming', 'purity', 'sex', 'noticed', 'first', 'moment', 'Yasuke', 'beautiful', 'red', 'bridge', 'slaps', 'hand', 'solidly', 'railing', 'Yasuke', 'job', 'fisherman', 'very', 'physical', 'work', 'up', 'nets', 'full', 'big', 'tuna', 'African', 'Olympic', 'runner', 'who', 'training', 'w/', 'Japanese', 'coach', 'film', 'be', 'Saeko', 'Yakusho', 'very', 'lively', 'physical', 'performance', 'Imamura', 'bright', 'colorful', 'palette', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'job', 'interview', 'scene', 'scene', 'nagging', 'phone', 'call', 'Yasuke', 'hateful', 'wife', 'are', 'shot', 'sterile', 'impersonal', 'panes', 'glass.I', 'could', 'go', 'complex', 'story', 'hilarious', 'setups', 'encourage', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'course', 'watch', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'ugly', 'boring', 'sex', 'TV', 'cinema', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'act', 'fun', 'life', 'affirming', 'manner']",N/A

Such is the environment of this film, Imamura's 2001 work, a perfect fusion of real and surreal.A young woman who fills with water--not urine, but pure water--which can only be ""vented"" with sexual release finds a willing partner in an older businessman who's lost his job.  The man, an urban dweller (Tokyo) meets the woman, a rural denizen (small seaside town), when he follows his dead friend's instructions on recovering a ""buried treasure"" the friend hid in a house that's now occupied by the water woman.Water as the essence of life, linked to sexuality, is also the environment of Francois Ozon's miraculously great film Swimming Pool, but here it is given a unique treatment by Imamura who uses, similarly, a young woman as his focus.  But here, unlike in Swimming Pool, the male is a major character; here, Imamura gives us both sides of the sexuality coin, male and female, and gives us, because of that, a more flowing film that fills the viewer with the essence of living for the moment.  By concentrating on the female, and leaving the male aside, Ozon took an approach that was more penetrating, analytical, psychological.  Imamura's way is a more emotive one.Though radically different from Imamura's prior film, The Eel, it nevertheless shares the same involvement of those whose lives are shaped by day to day necessities, those who live by working every day to survive.  The male's transition from corporate sales in Tokyo to fisherman in a small town gives us what Imamura wants us to experience; maybe Oingo Boingo's great song ""Wild Sex in the Working Class"" comes to mind.  Would the male have had the chance to engage in such amazing carnal pleasure if he'd been able to stay at his job and with his nagging wife in Tokyo?  One thinks not.An interesting companion piece to the director's 1966 film, The Pornographers, Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a radically different film that, rather than taking the perspective of those who observe and objectify sex (porn filmmakers), instead lets us feel what pleasure is directly through these two disparate characters, the young woman and the older man.  While The Pornographers' tone is wry, detached, satirical, that of Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is amused, delicious, even lip smacking.A fine how dee doo for all us hedonists indeed.
