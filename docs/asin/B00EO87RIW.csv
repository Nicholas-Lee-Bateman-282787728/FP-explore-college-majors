1668266,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00EO87RIW,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","Many of us have seen the great epic explorations of the tattered and worn decadent post-World War Italian high society social scene done by the late director Federico Fellini. Most notably his La Dolce Vita which captured his fine sense of the absurd machinations of the high rollers with plenty of time (and lira) on their hands. That film is a direct descendent of the film under review Paolo Sorrentino&#8217;s La Grande Bellezza where the leading character Jep (played by Toni Sevillo), a classic product of current Italian high society, conclusively proves that the rich and their hangers-on have not changes much in the last half century except their habits are become more exotic and expensive.The plot, well, this kind of film really has no plot, is centered on an exploration of Jep&#8217;s, well, boredom with life now that he had reached the age of sixty-five and has seen it all, heard it all, and done it all without making much of a dent in the world. Oh sure Jep (and maybe some others in his crowd) had youthful aspirations (maybe even dabbled a little in leftist politics), had written a book, maybe more but had settled into a life of bourgeois comfort and forgetfulness. While the &#8220;plot&#8221; may not be much the reason to watch this film, and you should, is the remarkable acting of Toni Sevillo as the faded novelist turned cultural critic bound to shoulder on in the vacuum of high society. That acting and the lush party scenes when high society breaks out are what kept my eyes riveted to the screen. A last fifteen minute or so of the seemingly mandatory attack on the powerful Roman Catholic Church in Italian life could, no, should have been cut at no lost to the great beauty of this cinematic study.",4,La Dolce Vita Redux,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,1735,"['Many', 'have', 'seen', 'great', 'epic', 'explorations', 'tattered', 'worn', 'decadent', 'post-World', 'War', 'Italian', 'high', 'society', 'social', 'scene', 'done', 'late', 'director', 'Federico', 'Fellini', 'Most', 'notably', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'captured', 'fine', 'sense', 'absurd', 'machinations', 'high', 'rollers', 'plenty', 'time', 'lira', 'hands', 'film', 'direct', 'descendent', 'film', 'review', 'Paolo', 'Sorrentino', '8217', 'La', 'Grande', 'Bellezza', 'where', 'leading', 'character', 'Jep', 'played', 'Toni', 'Sevillo', 'classic', 'product', 'current', 'Italian', 'high', 'society', 'conclusively', 'rich', 'hangers-on', 'have', 'not', 'changes', 'much', 'last', 'half', 'century', 'habits', 'are', 'become', 'more', 'exotic', 'expensive.The', 'plot', 'well', 'kind', 'film', 'really', 'plot', 'centered', 'exploration', 'Jep', '8217', 's', 'well', 'boredom', 'life', 'now', 'had', 'reached', 'age', 'sixty-five', 'seen', 'heard', 'done', 'making', 'much', 'dent', 'world', 'Oh', 'sure', 'Jep', 'maybe', 'others', 'crowd', 'had', 'youthful', 'aspirations', 'maybe', 'even', 'dabbled', 'little', 'leftist', 'politics', 'had', 'written', 'book', 'maybe', 'more', 'had', 'settled', 'life', 'bourgeois', 'comfort', 'forgetfulness', '8220', 'plot', '8221', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'much', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'should', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'Toni', 'Sevillo', 'faded', 'novelist', 'turned', 'cultural', 'critic', 'bound', 'shoulder', 'vacuum', 'high', 'society', 'acting', 'lush', 'party', 'scenes', 'when', 'high', 'society', 'breaks', 'out', 'are', 'what', 'kept', 'eyes', 'riveted', 'screen', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minute', 'so', 'seemingly', 'mandatory', 'attack', 'powerful', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Italian', 'life', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'lost', 'great', 'beauty', 'cinematic', 'study']",N/A
1668267,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00EO87RIW,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","So few films really exemplify their titles the way that &#8216;The Great Beauty&#8217; does.Not only is the film visually stunning, but on the flipside, the film finds ways to not only become emotionally &#8216;beautiful&#8217; but also exploitive of the not so beautiful moments, the moments glossed over with a beauty that is not wholly admirable or lasting.  &#8216;The Great Beauty&#8217; is, without a doubt, a film about life in its entirety and as such it is beautiful and ugly at the very same time.I hate the saying &#8216;they just didn&#8217;t get it&#8217; even though I have used it in the past.  It just feels so pass&eacute; to say that the reason someone doesn&#8217;t like something is because they &#8216;didn&#8217;t get it&#8217;.  The truth of the matter is that there are times with there is nothing to get, and even at that, we all respond to films (well, life in general) in different ways and with different vantage points and so there are times when something we see in a film is not seen by others simply because, for them, it isn&#8217;t there.  Who am I to say that they NEED to see the beauty in something that they so clearly don&#8217;t.  For me, film is such a personal experience, and because of that I gravitate to films that find a way to touch me personally.&#8216;The Great Beauty&#8217; did that for me.The film, on the surface, is a simple one.  Jep Gambardella is a simple man of simple pleasures who has created a life of luxurious fantasy in the heart of Rome thanks to his solitary contribution to the literary world.  Held on a pedestal because of his only novel, and touted by all as an intellectual, Jep finds himself almost suddenly void of meaning upon his sixty-fifth birthday.  Despite having everything at his fingertips, and more, he begins looking at life from a very different perspective.For me, this is where the film stakes its claim and where the beauty lies.For a film that can appear self-indulgent and exploitive, it is this &#8216;perspective&#8217; that truly builds the &#8216;beauty&#8217; in the title.  The film&#8217;s point is to exploit the self-indulgent, never once claiming relation to the act.  The film never glorifies this mockery, but instead uses Jep&#8217;s bewildered expressions and eventual self-sabotage as a way to build such depth of character.  Here we have a man who is used to having his way with everything and everyone basically having a midlife crisis (a few years too late) and realizing that everything he&#8217;s been accustomed to is far from the beautiful life so many think it is.Throughout the course of the film, Jep revisits the places that have held his hand, his heart and his attention  throughout his life and it is through these visitations that he begins to unlock the true beauty of his city, his memories and his life.  Weaving through images of beauty, lives of misfortune and tokens of appreciation, Jep discovers the truth behind the faade, and allows us to open our eyes alongside him.Yes, the film is about the self-indulgent, but for me this was anything but.With some of the most beautiful imagery I&#8217;ve seen put to film, &#8216;The Great Beauty&#8217; is just that, beautiful.  The score settles into every scene, the sets glisten in the majestic lighting, and the core performance from Toni Servillo anchors the film in something so rich, so soulful&#8230;so beautiful.",5,True beauty is never skin deep&#8230;,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,3392,"['So', 'few', 'films', 'really', 'exemplify', 'titles', 'way', '8216', 'Great', 'Beauty', '8217', 'does.Not', 'only', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'flipside', 'film', 'ways', 'not', 'only', 'become', 'emotionally', '8216', 'beautiful', '8217', 'also', 'exploitive', 'not', 'so', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'moments', 'glossed', 'beauty', 'not', 'wholly', 'admirable', 'lasting', '8216', 'Great', 'Beauty', '8217', 'doubt', 'film', 'life', 'entirety', 'such', 'beautiful', 'ugly', 'very', 'same', 'time.I', 'hate', 'saying', '8216', 'just', 'didn', '8217', 'get', '8217', 'even', 'have', 'used', 'past', 'just', 'feels', 'so', 'pass', 'eacute', 'say', 'reason', 'someone', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'something', '8216', '8217', 'get', '8217', 'truth', 'matter', 'are', 'times', 'nothing', 'get', 'even', 'respond', 'films', 'well', 'life', 'general', 'different', 'ways', 'different', 'vantage', 'points', 'so', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'something', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'seen', 'others', 'simply', '8217', 'Who', 'am', 'say', 'NEED', 'see', 'beauty', 'something', 'so', 'clearly', 'don', '8217', 't.', 'film', 'personal', 'experience', 'gravitate', 'films', 'find', 'way', 'touch', 'personally.', '8216', 'Great', 'Beauty', '8217', 'did', 'me.The', 'film', 'surface', 'simple', 'one', 'Jep', 'Gambardella', 'simple', 'man', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'who', 'created', 'life', 'luxurious', 'fantasy', 'heart', 'Rome', 'thanks', 'solitary', 'contribution', 'literary', 'world', 'Held', 'pedestal', 'only', 'novel', 'touted', 'intellectual', 'Jep', 'almost', 'suddenly', 'void', 'meaning', 'sixty-fifth', 'birthday', 'having', 'everything', 'fingertips', 'more', 'looking', 'life', 'very', 'different', 'perspective.For', 'where', 'film', 'claim', 'where', 'beauty', 'film', 'can', 'appear', 'self-indulgent', 'exploitive', '8216', '8217', 'truly', '8216', 'beauty', '8217', 'title', 'film', '8217', 's', 'point', 'exploit', 'self-indulgent', 'never', 'once', 'claiming', 'relation', 'act', 'film', 'never', 'mockery', 'instead', 'Jep', '8217', 'bewildered', 'expressions', 'eventual', 'self-sabotage', 'way', 'build', 'such', 'depth', 'character', 'Here', 'have', 'man', 'who', 'used', 'having', 'way', 'everything', 'everyone', 'basically', 'having', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'few', 'years', 'too', 'late', 'realizing', 'everything', '8217', 'been', 'accustomed', 'far', 'beautiful', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'think', 'course', 'film', 'Jep', 'places', 'have', 'held', 'hand', 'heart', 'attention', 'life', 'visitations', 'unlock', 'true', 'beauty', 'city', 'memories', 'life', 'Weaving', 'images', 'beauty', 'lives', 'misfortune', 'tokens', 'appreciation', 'Jep', 'truth', 'faade', 'open', 'eyes', 'alongside', 'him.Yes', 'film', 'self-indulgent', 'was', 'anything', 'but.With', 'most', 'beautiful', 'imagery', '8217', 'seen', 'put', 'film', '8216', 'Great', 'Beauty', '8217', 'just', 'beautiful', 'score', 'scene', 'sets', 'glisten', 'majestic', 'lighting', 'core', 'performance', 'Toni', 'Servillo', 'film', 'something', 'so', 'rich', 'so', 'soulful', '8230', 'so', 'beautiful']",N/A

1668270,A1ZPKKWT79C6HW,B00EO87RIW,"APC Reviews ""APC Reviews""","[121, 130]","""The Great Beauty"" (Italian: La Grande Bellezza), directed by Paolo Sorrentino, is a lovely film, simultaneously self aware and unashamed in channeling several of the themes, stylistic flourishes and concerns previously identified with classic Italian films like ""La Dolce Vita"", ""8 1/2"", ""L'Avventura"" and so forth. It makes superb use of Rome in all its classical beauty as a location for mournful contemplations on lost youth, present life, pending mortality and the tribal malaise and pretenses of Rome's creative elite, all presented with lots of style and sizzle. How much a viewer finds the film to ultimately be either haunting and depressing or stimulating and entertaining may depend on how close to home the life concerns and reflections of the protagonist are to the viewer's own life.The ""La Dolce Vita"" like story of dissipated Roman creative posers and party animals confronting middle age, lost promise, failure and mortality, as though Marcello Mastroianni had never managed to transcend the final scenes of ""La Dolce Vita"", and had just grown old where we last saw him, allows for some wicked insights into and comments on Roman artistic life and an Italian film genre that is best summarized as ""We are surrounded by so much beauty and greatness from the past, but we can only create empty beauty because we lack greatness, and can never achieve it again, and are tormented by the language and symbols of Catholicism, and are twisted into knots and self negation by intellectualizing about modernity. What else can we do but party? And, of course, we are melancholy at the emptiness of it all..."".If the ""The Great Beauty"" has an over all insight, which is suggested by the introductory quote from C&eacute;line's ""Journey to the End of the Night"", it is that the characters have all, in ways big and small, succumbed to the delusion that they each can, through art and the intellectualized control of discourse and expression, control and master the illusion of life. Each character has been either broken, humbled or sobered by the effort, and has found that a great deal of what they could have enjoyed about the illusion has been lost to them in an effort to dominate it.The protagonist, Jep Gambardella, a once promising author with only one book of intellectualized social commentary to his credit, published very early in his career, after which he has settled into a long languorous slide to middle age as a ""journalist"" reporter on the arts in Rome, is sympathetic in that he has begun to grasp this underlying truth, and is working to reconcile himself to it. Many other characters in the film seem to have settled into the sort of dour connoisseurship and bored hostility usually associated with vendors in a Parisian flea market.The film abounds in vignettes and passing comments, many quite touching and some of them quite depressing, involving different characters who come and go from scene to scene, all pointing to the fury of now being held prisoner by the long shadow of the past. There is, for example, the elderly fallen aristocratic couple, living in the basement of their family's old palazzo, which is open to tourists to earn income, who rent themselves out as aristocratic dinner guests. On returning late at night from a party, where Jep had hired them to impersonate old rivals of their family, who were unavailable but whom Jep had wished to attend a dinner party at his apartment being held for a Mother Teresa like saint that Jep wishes to interview, the wife of the elderly couple slips into the old palazzo and inserts some coins into an audio guide and, sobbing, listens to an audio explanation of the palazzo and an idealized account of her life there as a child. And no Italian film aspiring to social comment would be complete without scenes that highlight the vanity and fallibility of the Catholic establishment.Perhaps the most telling, and memorable, at least for this viewer, line in ""The Great Beauty"" is spoken by Jep's hapless friend Romano, a seemingly talentless creative striver continuously rejected by Roman elites and audiences and continuously working to launch a fresh assault on the mountaintop with a new project. Romano, who angrily criticizes the basis of his artistic rejection, while masochistically humiliating himself in pursuit of a beautiful woman who can barely stand speaking to him, finally wins some approval by giving a performance piece where he grovels to the audience that he is ""ordinary"". Momentarily heartened by the applause he receives, even though the woman he craves walks out of the show as soon as he has finished, he soon decides to quit Rome altogether.He tells Jep of his brief success with the audience. Jep replies, with some genuine empathy for his friend, that it's wonderful that he received a positive response. But Romano tells Jep that he is leaving Rome, and returning to his small hometown, from whence he had come to Rome as a young man. ""Rome has disappointed me"", he tells Jep.This is really the insight moment for the film. The inability of someone, and that someone is almost everyone, to question their own consciousness, to in any way question or blame their own essential nature for their life, or to question their choice of an environment for themselves, much like the choice of a lover, that is toxic for them. Each person thinks they can transcend their environment and normalize their own consciousness through verbal definitions and success. Failing to do so, they blame the environment, or their own lack of effort, rather than their own consciousness and its need, like a drug addict, for that environment, no matter how toxic it may be to and devastating for them personally. Many a failed love affair travels the same path.Jep briefly considers that he too may have exhausted his life in Rome, and that he might return to where he came from, or go on to some where else. But, in the end, Jep's consciousness is Rome. He cannot leave what he is, or go back to something he was not. Jep has become his environment, no matter how empty its charms and denizens may have become for him. If he is disappointed in Rome, it is because he is disappointed in himself. The two are inseparable. He is haunted by ""the great beauty"" of a moment in youth when all seemed possible, if only through a then youthful ignorance of life and himself. He has no where to go now but onwards, an observer of his own essential nature.The film's Fellini like cinematic touches, which run on a steroids throughout, are in many ways busy work, lacking the organic relationship to the characters and film making that the same devices had in so many Fellini films. The film could have been made with much less overt style and have lost none of its essential nature nor any of its story impact. That is in a way a tribute to the strength of its conception and to the talents involved.All that said, the film is gorgeous. Toni Servillo as Jep Gambardella is superb, the role of a lifetime for the actor, and all the casting and production are first rate. No other film since Fellini's has so captured the look, feel and vibe of Rome as both an open air museum and a grand movie set for the personal dramas and struggles of the creatively obsessed, jaded, cynical, malevolent and determined. The film plays like a wry dirge for an over ripe funeral procession. But it is a beautiful and, ultimately thoughtful reflection on the energy and openness of youth fading into a fragile but wise middle age. The place is intensely Rome The style is uniquely Italian, But the story is human and universal.

Great story telling and cinematography, influenced by all the Grand Italian Directors and yet, uniquely Sorrentino's own masterpiece. This film, like a trip to Rome, has the feel of visiting an ancient mausoleum with a party inside, full of individual stories, and histories of those who have lived and inhabited their lives there. Like a tourist, the stories can be so easily be missed in favor of the superficial, and yet these give meaning to what could otherwise be just another forgotten photo in a drawer of a beautiful facade or statue.

1668283,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00EO87RIW,David A. Wend,"[4, 6]","Jep Gambardella is a successful journalist and novelist whose only book (titled The Human Apparatus), written when he was in his 20s, was wildly successful but he has not found himself able to write another. He is admired and is wealthy, living in an apartment in Rome opposite the Coliseum. Jep is a member of a broad intellectual circle of writers, actors, directors etc who enjoy the good life and party the night away. At the start of the film, Jep is celebrating his 65th birthday, and he begins to take stock of his life. He receives new that his first love, Lorena, has died. He husband has found a diary where Stefania names Jep as the love of her life while her husband was a mere good companion.  The film takes us into Jep&#8217;s life and we watch as he spends his days walking the streets of Rome, observing the life around him, and have brief affairs.  Jep&#8217;s view of life comes during a voice over, as he is walking, and explains that when he came to Rome at 26, he decided that he wanted to become &#8220;the king of the high life.&#8221; However, he did not want to be a spectator at these parties but have the power to make them fail.The Great Beauty (La Grande Bellezza) is episodic with one scene flowing into another randomly. Jep&#8217;s character is very engrossing and I found his conversations and action interesting. One such scene is where his disparages, in a nice way, a fellow-writer Viola at a dinner party. One feels that his comments are on target, even if his observations are cruel.  The camera is simply an observer and watching the film you might wonder where the film is going.  Simply put, we are just observers of Jep&#8217;s life.  He has an affair with Ramona, the daughter of an old friend who owns a strip club.  His daughter Romona is performing while Jep is there and together they spend a few nights together.  He takes Romona on a magical late night visit to the museums and palaces of Rome, courtesy of another friend, Stefano (Giorgio Pasotti).  She has some insight into Jep and says that his writer&#8217;s block is due to his life in Rome. But as quickly as Romona enters Jep&#8217;s life, she disappears.  There are some comic elements in the film. Jep&#8217;s editor is a smart talking woman dwarf who is also a good cook and Jep at one point is set to interview a 104-year old with two cooked teeth.Toni Servillo is fabulous as Jep and Sabrina Ferilli (Romona) crafts a marvelous performance. One wishes she had more screen time.  The biggest star of the film would have to be the city of Rome, which is treated as a place of beauty but also a state of mind. An actor friend of Jep tells him late in the film that he is leaving Rome for his home town because he can&#8217;t function any more.  Director Paolo Sorrentino has been likened to Frederico Fellini (my wife agrees) but he uses comedy more in his films than Fellini, and while The Great Beauty can be termed an updated version of La Dolce Vita, Sorrentino has his own style.  I can recall the interest and excitement with a new file by Fellini opened and I felt the same feeling anticipating The Great Beauty. I am looking forward to his films to come.",5,An Engrossing and Beautiful Film,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,3172,"['Jep', 'Gambardella', 'successful', 'journalist', 'novelist', 'only', 'book', 'titled', 'Human', 'Apparatus', 'written', 'when', 'was', '20s', 'was', 'wildly', 'successful', 'not', 'found', 'able', 'write', 'admired', 'wealthy', 'living', 'apartment', 'Rome', 'opposite', 'Coliseum', 'Jep', 'member', 'broad', 'intellectual', 'circle', 'writers', 'actors', 'directors', 'etc', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'life', 'party', 'night', 'away', 'start', 'film', 'Jep', 'celebrating', '65th', 'birthday', 'take', 'stock', 'life', 'new', 'first', 'love', 'Lorena', 'died', 'husband', 'found', 'diary', 'where', 'Stefania', 'names', 'Jep', 'love', 'life', 'husband', 'was', 'mere', 'good', 'companion', 'film', 'Jep', '8217', 's', 'life', 'watch', 'days', 'walking', 'streets', 'Rome', 'observing', 'life', 'have', 'brief', 'affairs', 'Jep', '8217', 's', 'view', 'life', 'voice', 'over', 'walking', 'when', 'came', 'Rome', '26', 'decided', 'wanted', 'become', '8220', 'king', 'high', 'life.', '8221', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'spectator', 'parties', 'have', 'power', 'make', 'fail.The', 'Great', 'Beauty', 'La', 'Grande', 'Bellezza', 'episodic', 'one', 'scene', 'flowing', 'randomly', 'Jep', '8217', 's', 'character', 'very', 'engrossing', 'found', 'conversations', 'action', 'interesting', 'One', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'disparages', 'nice', 'way', 'fellow-writer', 'Viola', 'dinner', 'party', 'One', 'comments', 'are', 'target', 'even', 'observations', 'are', 'cruel', 'camera', 'simply', 'observer', 'watching', 'film', 'might', 'wonder', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'Simply', 'put', 'are', 'just', 'observers', 'Jep', '8217', 's', 'life', 'affair', 'Ramona', 'daughter', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'strip', 'club', 'daughter', 'Romona', 'performing', 'Jep', 'there', 'together', 'spend', 'few', 'nights', 'together', 'Romona', 'magical', 'late', 'night', 'visit', 'museums', 'palaces', 'Rome', 'courtesy', 'friend', 'Stefano', 'Giorgio', 'Pasotti', 'insight', 'Jep', 'writer', '8217', 's', 'block', 'due', 'life', 'Rome', 'as', 'quickly', 'Romona', 'enters', 'Jep', '8217', 's', 'life', 'are', 'comic', 'elements', 'film', 'Jep', '8217', 's', 'editor', 'smart', 'talking', 'woman', 'dwarf', 'who', 'also', 'good', 'cook', 'Jep', 'one', 'point', 'set', 'interview', '104-year', 'old', 'two', 'cooked', 'teeth.Toni', 'Servillo', 'fabulous', 'Jep', 'Sabrina', 'Ferilli', 'Romona', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'One', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'biggest', 'star', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'city', 'Rome', 'treated', 'place', 'beauty', 'also', 'state', 'mind', 'actor', 'friend', 'Jep', 'late', 'film', 'leaving', 'Rome', 'home', 'town', 'can', '8217', 'function', 'more', 'Director', 'Paolo', 'Sorrentino', 'been', 'likened', 'Frederico', 'Fellini', 'wife', 'comedy', 'more', 'films', 'Fellini', 'Great', 'Beauty', 'can', 'be', 'termed', 'updated', 'version', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'Sorrentino', 'own', 'style', 'can', 'recall', 'interest', 'excitement', 'new', 'file', 'Fellini', 'opened', 'felt', 'same', 'feeling', 'anticipating', 'Great', 'Beauty', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'films', 'come']",N/A

1668285,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00EO87RIW,Doug Anderson,"[0, 1]","There are of course many great fictional films about artists interpreting their own lives. Wild Strawberries and 8 1/2 and Annie Hall and Synechdoche NY are each (among other things) narratives about the way artists construct identity/sensibility narratives. A great recent addition to this group of films is The Great Beauty. This film and its main character are incredibly appealing as both film and main character examine the grand illusions/passions that inspire us and determine the course of our lives (something many films do) but the film and main character also have a way of deflating some of the myths we tell about our own lives in a way that humanizes both the narrative and narrator (something few films do). When we meet the main character, Jep, he is a successful journalist who is celebrating his 65th birthday in grand style among Rome's cultural elite. At first it seems he is some kind of superficial playboy/social celebrity who lives for the limelight (and he is that, in part) but as the film progresses we learn he is also a man of substance and sensibility and the film becomes an examination of that substance/sensibility, an examination of how hecame to live the life he now lives. We learn that he enjoyed/suffered early love as well as early success as a novelist but that for reasons not wholly explained neither love nor artistic success were what he had imagined them to be. Although this film is full of intriguing ambiguities (that lend it its allure and cast all life events/decisions in a twilight of indeterminancy) it would seem that he was not cut out for life as others have imagined and lived it and instead of living for the love of one woman or living the life of the artist he became a connoisseur of life, a flaneur, a journalist who walks round the edges of life and who peaks across many thresholds but never fully enters into any relationships that might compromise his independence. He interviews and analyzes and interprets other artists and assesses other people's lives and ambitions, passions and illusions (and he is especially good at this because he seems to have no illusions of his own). He is applauded for his cultural insights and social graces and he enjoys this vocation as it allows him to exercise and express his sensibility and share his great powers of observation with a very select public but does not require him to do any more than observe life (and this more than any single love or artistic aspiration seems to be the great enduring passion of his life). Jep sizes up all those he comes into contact with but no one he comes into contact with is as fully-formed as he is and so no one he comes into contact with is in any position to size him up. That is our job. And it is no easy task. Even for Jep.The Great Beauty is a great film about identity/sensibility and the illusions people sometimes carry with them for their entire lives that contribute to that identity/sensibility and its also a film about people who discover (sometimes early, sometimes late in life) that their story gets more interesting not less so when they let go of their illusions about life and about themselves (even though everyone, it seems, holds on to at least one). Jep for instance is smart enough to know he is not a great novelist or even a very good one but in a way this realization, painful as it must have been, must also have come as a kind of relief, a kind of permission to enjoy life instead of suffer through it as most artists do. He does write for a living but he doesn't write fiction nor autobiography (nor any combination thereof), he just writes about cultural figures and usually in an entertaining way for an elite and discerning readership. What he has a harder time coming to terms with is the memory of that one great love (a love that seems to have lasted only as long as one of those impossibly long and impossibly dreamy late-summer afternoons). This memory (or dream) of love that he revisits over and over again is the source of his greatest joy but also the source of much uncertainty, much unresolved (and perhaps irresolvable) wonder. The fact that he can never quite come to terms with it perhaps explains why he became who he is as much as anything else. It may even be that he needs this mystery, this illusion, and that he cultivates it, protects it, as if it were his secret core, his sustaining dream. It doesn't sound like much of a life or story but his take on things is so clear-sighted (in regards to everything besides love) its hard to resist. Even though no life is perfectly lived it would seem that Jep has found the life best suited for that sensibility he so values.

Van,"[4, 6]","There may be movies that provide more aesthetic bliss to the viewer (and listener) than The Great Beauty, but I doubt that any of them are as thematically rich and thought-provoking. And vice-versa! And this is appropriate, because, as one might guess from the title, one of the things this movie is about is the nature of beauty and our approach and response to it.But it's certainly not for all tastes.The biggest sticking point for some will be its lack of a conventional plot. There is no specific problem that confronts our hero, Jep, early in the first act and which gets resolved late in the third. It is simply the story of a man who, after his 65th birthday party, begins to gradually question his life--and even that is not telegraphed; it dawns on you slowly. You are simply watching a series of episodes in the life of a human being, and learning a great deal about him.If that is acceptable to you, then know these things:-- It's a visual and aural feast. The beautiful city of Rome, and the faces of a large ensemble of character actors, are lensed with, well, great beauty. And this is accompanied by a soundtrack that includes some of the most soul-stirring modern music, such as David Lang's ""I Lie"" and Arvo Part's setting of ""My Heart's in the Highlands.""-- Not only that, but the editing style is purely cinematic, designed not to just tell a story, but to create juxtapositions that startle, soothe, illuminate.-- It rewards repeated viewings. In fact, there are some things that will puzzle you the first time, that you'll only make sense of ten minutes after they happen (including the most important event in the movie, which happens offstage), and when you see it again, what happened will not only be clear to you, but the reason for the initial obscurity (to be true to Jep's emotional life) will be clear.-- It is drowning in symbols, but none of them are simple and programmatic (X stands for Y); instead they are multiply suggestive. Some of the action, for instance, is portrayed as taking place in spaces that are obviously other than where they must be (the usual substitution is some exquisite locale, full of open space, for someplace mundane and cramped). That's a look inside Jep's head.-- It has extraordinary thematic richness. I told a friend that it was ""about everything."" I can imagine an entire book devoted to exploring what it says about the human condition, and how it says it, and would not bet against that actually happening someday. (I've already spent the better part of a whole day writing about it at IMDB, after seeing it a second time.) Of course, it is not about everything equally, so here's a list of some of its main concerns: how memory haunts and shapes us, the unknowable in life, whether the world (and art) should be analyzed or just experienced, whether viewing art (in the broad sense), and hence living our lives, should be an active or passive experience.-- After two viewings and some thought, it starts to reveal more plot than it seems to have had at first. There is, after all, a story here, involving Jep's relationships with two women, one in his past, one in the present. (It's not obviously a story the first time, any more than anything in your life is, except in retrospect.) So, yes, add the nature of love to that list.-- It is touching, mostly melancholy, but ultimately hopeful. The ending, in fact, is very quietly transcendent.-- It is, in places, very, very funny.In my admittedly insanely fine-tuned ranking of my favorite films, The Great Beauty originally clocked in at #64. It jumped to #35 on its second viewing, and I could easily imagine it gaining another 10 places.

1668295,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B00EO87RIW,Jack E. Levic,"[0, 5]","An Italian film set in beautiful Rome that won the 2014 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film - What could be better, right? I was eager to see THE GREAT BEAUTY with high expectations but I was seriously disappointed. THE GREAT BEAUTY is a rambling film that moves about in so many directions never settling on a clear story.Jep Gambardella (a wonderful Toni Servillo) has just turned 65. In his young days, he wrote a book  that became a modern Italian literary classic. He never wrote another book and seems to live off the fame of his one success. He parties hard on the Roman night circuit but has no direction in life. He is surrounded by bitter, lonely people grasping to stay young through drugs and botox (The botox party scene drags on and on and even a nun shows up). The party scenes are numerous and  have the feel of a 70's movie.THE GREAT BEAUTY has a cast of thousands it seems. Jep's party friends and associates and an array of characters who seem to have no purpose to the story. People pop in and out with no clear reason. A Saudi man in traditional Saudi garb is seen with a woman covered from head to toe with only her eyes showing. Later they are seen in a restaurant. The man is eating. I wondered how the woman could eat if she wanted too with her face covered. No explanation as to who these people are. We see Chinese tourists. One falls over dead and that is the end of that scene. What just happened?Jeb works as a journalist but doesn't seem interested in interviewing anyone when the opportunity arises. One of his few friends is his boss who is a dwarf. Now there would be a story as to how this woman was able to become a successful businesswoman., but we see her in a bad wig just offering advice to Jeb.The story seems to want to make a point that is never clear. Is Jeb regretting decisions he has made and the life he could have had? He learns that a woman he knew briefly when he was 20 considered him her only true love. Again, an interesting story point is lost here. Then there is the &#34;saint&#34; on earth who shows up looking like something from a horror film. What is going on here?The take seems to be that life in Rome is miserable and there is a sadness and loneliness in the air. People are addicted to life in Rome yet they are unhappy but can't leave. This lovely and vibrant city does not get its rewards in this film.This is a slow, very slow moving film that seems to get lost in its own grandeur. Paolo Sorrentino directed and wrote the film.

Jep is an articulate, thoughtful, ambitious man who is capable of insight into himself and also capable of sharing it with others.  But he is not without flaws -- apathy, vanity, overindulgence.  But he is real, and completely absorbing. 2. The portrayal of the people surrounding Jep-- their stories, their characters -- are  brilliantly done, diverse but totally coherent within the framework of the movie 3.  The photography of Rome in all its glory.  Watching the film I thought I really want to see Rome, but reflecting later, I realized I would never see it in real life, walking dusty streets, as I was given to see it here -- the aerial views, the sweeping panoramas, dropping down into the courtyards and terraces.  You need to view several times just to be able to take it all in 4. The music.  Especially the gorgeous haunting The Beatitudes, which I have continued to listen to after watching the movie.  5.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[0, 1]","Oscar-winning ""La Grande Ballezza"" (Best Foreign Film, 2014) is directed by Paolo Sorrentino (who also wrote the story and screenplay). We see the hedonism and lack of direction displayed by the privileged classes in Rome, complete with gyrating dancers, gorgeous homes, snide gossip and lavish lifestyles. Our charming hero is a one-trick pony who wrote a best seller decades ago and has been coasting on that glory ever since.As this Fellini-esque film unfolded, I felt it was a bit too Artistic for my taste, but then, after leaving the theater, it generated a lively discussion; so it did exactly what Art is supposed to do. Now I have ordered ""La Dolce Vita"" from the library; I am number 64 in line, so I'll have to wait a bit before I can draw an informed comparison. (My thanks to the JayFlix.net participant who made this recommendation. You know who you are...)You'll want to see:* Tony Servillo (""Il Divo"") the appealing 60ish lead actor who plays the disenchanted bon vivant who wryly observes all the absurdity.* The peek into our hero's past which may explain his detachment.* The skewering of affectations; at one point he rips into a woman who has been bragging about her credentials: as a woman, as a mother and as a Communist.* The hilarious Botox clinic (""take a number"").* The sight of the Colosseum, in all its bedraggled glory.* The ironic views of Performance Art: e.g., a nude woman with a veil over her head runs smack dab into a rock wall. She's disappointed that she wasn't able to transcend it. Audiences are consistently polite and bewildered.* Many views of the ancient viaduct, designed by Roman engineers and built by slaves, to deliver fresh water to the city. Even in decay, it's impressive.* The exposure of the religious charlatans who surround today's ""saints.""* The Catholic priest who was far more interested in cooking and recipes than in religion.* A glimpse of some of the tourist spots: museums, art galleries and impressive cityscapes.The film is not rated, just remember it's Italian, so expect nudity (both male and female), but no sweaty bodies, car chases, gunshots or blowie uppie stuff.

Although it is hearing of the death of his first love which brings existential despair up close and personal for Jep, we see through his eyes, as he plunges into the swings and roundabouts of parties, sex, and spectacle that he (and all around) are doing this to stop awareness of the knowledge that we are all on that journey to the grave.The film swings constantly between the overindulgence of spectacle, movement, noise and distraction, and silence, emptiness, spaciousness, some kind of surrendering acceptance, as exemplified by the presence of a 103 year old nun, soon to be canonised. However, the spectacle of the lizard-faced, decrepit nun crawling in suffering penance on hands and knees up a flight of stairs as part of her spiritual, saintly journey, is no particular solace either.The performances, (especially Toni Servillo as Gambardella) are all impeccable, the whole filmic quality of the piece is lush, wonderful, artful, but at the end I was left looking for something which I&#8217;m not certain I found &#8211; something to value, some quality of heart. In some ways, though the characters in this piece have a sophistication and finesse, and a stylish wit and brio, which makes them at least knowingly witty company, I was left with the same feeling of distaste for humankind which reading Bret Easton Ellis&#8217;s The Laws of Attraction gave me. And the point of that comparison, is that this is as partial and incomplete a view of humankind (very little that is kind, in this) as the other side unreal saccharine view of traditional Hollywood. This was a world peopled pretty well by only the stunningly beautiful or the Fellini-esque grotesque. It missed the extraordinary of ordinary itself.As filmic spectacle, it is indeed splendid, but is it more than just a very finely lacquered mind-game to be dissected and debated.

The protagonist (with the unlikely name &#34;Jep&#34;), a writer whose renown rests on the success of the one book he wrote many years earlier, attends parties, spends time with friends, and experiences the ordinary events of life - there is no &#34;plot&#34; or character arc other than his admission that he has spent his life searching for &#34;the great beauty&#34; without finding it.Throughout the long (around 2  hour) film, there are many gems of observation.  One of Jep's friends says goodbye to him upon revealing that after 40 years in Rome, the city has &#34;disappointed&#34; him, so he is leaving without saying goodbye to anyone else or even taking any of his belongings with him.  An elderly, ascetic nun who has devoted her life to caring for the poor in Africa, defends her decision to not give interviews by explaining that when one takes a vow of poverty, one does not discuss it - one lives it.  At one point, Jep learns that a woman he dated in 1970 and has not heard from since, has just died.  Her husband tells him that he broke the lock on her diary in order to read it; Jep asks if he can also read it, and the husband says that he already threw the diary away.  A man is said to have the keys to the most beautiful buildings in Rome, entrusted to him by &#34;princesses&#34; (who are shown to be elderly ladies); someone asks if he is a &#34;doorman,&#34; and he says no, he is simply &#34;trustworthy.&#34;These are only a few of the glimpses of revealed truth in the film.  The theme is supremely ironic - &#34;The Great Beauty&#34; may be one of the most beautifully photographed films I have seen in a long time - every shot is exquisitely framed and composed, but the characters seem unaware of the unspeakably lovely world they inhabit.  The outstanding soundtrack, a mix of classical and contemporary music, is often revealed to be actual music within the film's action, rather than mere &#34;background.&#34;Not recommended for everyone, &#34;The Great Beauty&#34; requires and rewards close attention.

This is a film that can be as complex as you let it be. From the opening sequence to the closing credits there is always something waiting to be found.It begins with the tourist group surrounded by angelic voices and sublime architecture all the while missing the chance to discover the wonders of Rome themselves and instead relying on the well worn facts from their guide. The only tourist that ventures out away from the crowd succumbs to an unexpected death. Take your chances and don't miss a thing before it's too late.A group of friends who party hard and live lavish but have nothing meaningful to show for it. Some admire each other while others despise each other but after all the desires to be acknowledged are set aside all they have is their own self respect. Sometimes they end up with less as in the case of the wealthy neighbor who goes down for white collar crime and corruption.A religious vignette shows us a priest in line for great leadership who is interested in nothing more than the sound of his own voice and cooking techniques while being chauffeur driven around Rome and avoiding any requests for spiritual enlightenment. Meanwhile an old nun serves her fellow humans quietly and without accolades all the while struggling on her journey to serve her faith even being weighed down by the symbol she wears around her neck. Birds themselves can't even take her life as she blows them away until her gracious work is done.Attempts to connect with old friends, casual sex that's meaningless, meaningful talks that are casual, lucrative paintings made by frustrated children, ancient hidden treasures that few will ever experience, rumour after silly rumour, younger generations losing contact with their parents and losing respect for their forefathers, disappearing giraffes, and simple lunches with people that might look small but have very big hearts round out a journey of discovery and an attempt to reveal the elusive trick.A slow trip down the peaceful river while the camera pans to the little details that make up The Great Beauty that is Rome and life.

Oleson,"[0, 0]","There may be spoilers.This award winning film from Italy (""La Grande Bellezza"") provides a gorgeous look at Rome in all it beauty and decadence in equal measure.  Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo) is a charming, sophisticated and attractive 65 year old man looking at retirement.  He is best known for a novel he wrote decades earlier.  His one and only book.  Since then he's been living the high life while making regular contributions to a magazine.  His circle of friends are seemingly and similarly concerned only about the next dinner party or garden gabfests.As Jep looks back at his life, he wonders if he missed the boat.  He has no family.  His one true love was a girl he met when he first arrived in Rome at the age of 26.  He discovers that she recently died and he incurs flashbacks of their short time together.  Romantic, wistful and sad.  Brilliantly directed and co-written by Paolo Sorrentino, the film has a Felliniesqe feel and has striking similarities to ""La Dolce Vita.""The silly extravagance is shown is several scenes of unusual art.  One involves performance art where a naked woman runs into a wall with her head.  Another has a pubescent girl provoked into anger by her father.  She then begins to toss cans of paint at a huge wall of canvass, creating a work of art worth millions of dollars.  One of my favorite scenes has Jep visiting a middle age acquaintance who has a large villa with a courtyard that displays photos taken every day of his life.  A remarkable idea.I found the film terribly profound as I look back on life and wonder ""Is that all there is?"" echoing the Leiber and Stoller classic song.  The film won a well-deserved Oscar and Golden Globe for best foreign language film earlier this year.  Technically the film is a wonder as well.  Highly recommended.The Blu ray version I watched was from Criterion, and to no surprise it is beautiful.  It comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.

1668318,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00EO87RIW,Paul Allaer,"[0, 1]","""The Great Beauty"" (2013 release from Italy; 137 min.) brings the story of Jeb Gambardells (played by Toni Servillo, who looks uncannily like Frank DeFord, the erstwhile Sports Illustrated writer). Jeb once upon a time (40 years ago, in fact) wrote a famous novel called ""The Human Apparatus"", and ever since he's lived on that reputation. Shortly after the movie opens (with the apparent death, never explained, of a Japanese tourist in Rome), we find ourselves at a massive party. Turns out to be Jeb's 65th birthday party from his pad overlooking the Coliseum. The music is thumbing, and at one point the crowd is doing ""La Colita"", a Macarona-reminding orchestrated dance move that is just hilarious. After that, the movie settles in and we follow Jeb along as he is getting around, or just getting on, through Rome, reflecting on his life and unfulfilled desires. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this movie is co-written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino, best known for his 2008 film ""Il Divo"", but who most recently misfired badly with the 2011 movie ""This Must Be the Place"" (starring Sean Penn as the Cures frontman-like Robert Smith). ""The Great Beauty"" is a nice return to form then for Sorrentino. Second, the way the movie unfolds, as Jeb meets random people in random places, you cannot help but be reminded of Federico Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"", now 50 years ago. I assume that Sorrentino is paying his respect to what must be a huge influence on him as a film maker. Third, the movie works very well at times (for example, when Jeb gets to know 42 yr. old Ramona, played beautifully by Sabrina Ferilli), but at other times simply seems to meander, for me anyway. Which of course leads to my next comment that the movie is overly long. Had it been tightened by 30 min. or so, I believe the movie's focus would've benefited. Last but not least, there are some great lines in the movie that will stick with you. At some point, someone asks Jeb why he didn't write another novel after the debut instant-classic. Jeb ponders his response for a moment, and replies ""I went out too much at night. Rome makes you waste a lot of time..."", ha!This movie has gotten a lot of accolades, including an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Movie. I am sure there is a great movie in here somewhere, but for me it was just okay. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood when I saw this, or maybe I simply can't appreciate an Italian nonsensical movie. Even though it's already available here on Amazon as an Instant Video, the movie opened just this past weekend at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati. The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended fairly poorly (the cold weather may have been a factor). In any event, whether you have a chance to see this in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or on DVD, I suggest you check this out for yourself and draw your own conclusions as to the artistic merits of ""The Great Beauty"".",4,"3.5 stars...

One's senior years offer experience/insights/time impetus to do just that. Viewed at younger ages; yes, a great mind-starter too.There is poem I recommend by William Wordsworth: IMITATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM EARLY CHIlDHOOD which I often revisit which conveys good thoughts to consider before or after viewing this Beauty: When you're young, experiment, make mistakes, go ahead, make a mess.

To finally make sense of what it was that made it so fine. Or not. I've seen this film a few time so far, and will see it  again and again until I croak.

In all, reconsidering life experiences helps jell it all.(In fact, a full-lived life is full of ups and downs, all offer lessons).  This film is a fine catalyst. And in the meantime, beautiful, engaging, fascinating, bizarre, sumptuous, provocative.

I hope like the previous &#34;Il Divo&#34; it achieves another Oscar nomination!!At 135 minutes it is a movie that will either envelop you with its stunning visuals (right up to the end of the closing credits in fact) and intelligent script or leave you thinking it is way too long and over indulgent. Many of Sorrentino's normal trademarks are here - the use of different dance and music to great dramatic effect; beautifully composed visuals, though his continual use of tracking and crane shots can get a tad tiresome; a wide cast of strong supporting actors that serves Servillo's immaculately attired but tired and acerbic persona well; and, the story of a man having lived the high life being woken up to face his demons - but what lifts this film to a higher level is its love affair with Rome.The use of locations and few studio sets (with some amazing use of animals for key scenes) shows off the beauty of Rome and its architecture to great effect. Top that with a story centered around the Italian wealthy who live and party in Rome has led inevitably to comparisons with La Dolce Vita of Fellini and Antonioni films of that era. But with little reference to the recent politics of Berlusconi and modern Italy this is an exploration of the current vacuousness of living within Rome's elites both in the Arts and interestingly the Church, given the Vatican's presence within Rome.The script is razor sharp throughout. The outright or latent bitchiness on display, leads to many great one-liners or acidic exchanges. This is beautifully captured in a scene where he openly tears into a friend at a roof top party after she challenges him to disagree with her. His Svengali female midget magazine editor, pragmatic housekeeper, friends including the widowed husband of his early love and a blossoming relationship with a 40 year old stripper (a fine performance by Sabrina Ferilli) who is killed, all add to the growing emptiness. This leads to Jep&#8217;s encounters in the final section with a cardinal in line to be pope who is happier espousing food recipes over religious advice and a Mother Theresa clone from Africa whose simple life of piety and suffering contrasts so dramatically with Jep&#8217;s.Many reviews of this film seem to still pine for the New Wave Italian cinema of the 60s &#8211; this latest opus from Sorrentino and Servillo shows for me Italian cinema is very much alive and well in the 21st century!",5,A feast for your eyes (& your ears)!,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,2727,"['team', 'Toni', 'Servillo', 'lead', 'role', 'sybaritic', 'critic', 'novelist', 'having', 'only', 'ever', 'written', 'one', 'successful', 'novel', '20', 'years', 'playing', 'out', 'role', 'Jep', 'Gambardella', 'one', 'oldest', 'swingers', 'Rome', 'directed', 'co-written', 'Paolo', 'Sorrentino', 'have', 'again', 'hit', 'pay-dirt', 'hope', 'previous', '34', 'Il', 'Divo', '34', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '135', 'minutes', 'movie', 'will', 'either', 'envelop', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'closing', 'credits', 'fact', 'intelligent', 'script', 'leave', 'thinking', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'indulgent', 'Many', 'Sorrentino', 'normal', 'trademarks', 'are', 'here', 'use', 'different', 'dance', 'music', 'great', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'visuals', 'continual', 'use', 'tracking', 'crane', 'shots', 'can', 'get', 'tad', 'tiresome', 'wide', 'cast', 'strong', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Servillo', 'immaculately', 'attired', 'tired', 'acerbic', 'persona', 'well', 'story', 'man', 'having', 'lived', 'high', 'life', 'being', 'woken', 'up', 'face', 'demons', 'what', 'film', 'higher', 'level', 'love', 'affair', 'Rome.The', 'use', 'locations', 'few', 'studio', 'sets', 'amazing', 'use', 'animals', 'key', 'scenes', 'beauty', 'Rome', 'architecture', 'great', 'effect', 'Top', 'story', 'centered', 'Italian', 'wealthy', 'who', 'live', 'party', 'Rome', 'led', 'inevitably', 'comparisons', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'Fellini', 'Antonioni', 'films', 'era', 'little', 'reference', 'recent', 'politics', 'Berlusconi', 'modern', 'Italy', 'exploration', 'current', 'vacuousness', 'living', 'Rome', 'elites', 'Arts', 'interestingly', 'Church', 'given', 'Vatican', 'presence', 'Rome.The', 'script', 'razor', 'sharp', 'outright', 'latent', 'bitchiness', 'display', 'many', 'great', 'one-liners', 'acidic', 'exchanges', 'beautifully', 'captured', 'scene', 'where', 'openly', 'friend', 'roof', 'top', 'party', 'disagree', 'Svengali', 'female', 'midget', 'magazine', 'editor', 'pragmatic', 'housekeeper', 'including', 'widowed', 'husband', 'early', 'love', 'blossoming', 'relationship', '40', 'year', 'old', 'stripper', 'fine', 'performance', 'Sabrina', 'Ferilli', 'who', 'killed', 'add', 'growing', 'emptiness', 'Jep', '8217', 's', 'encounters', 'final', 'section', 'cardinal', 'line', 'be', 'pope', 'who', 'happier', 'espousing', 'food', 'recipes', 'religious', 'advice', 'Mother', 'Theresa', 'clone', 'Africa', 'simple', 'life', 'piety', 'suffering', 'contrasts', 'so', 'dramatically', 'Jep', '8217', 's.Many', 'reviews', 'film', 'seem', 'still', 'pine', 'New', 'Wave', 'Italian', 'cinema', '60s', '8211', 'latest', 'opus', 'Sorrentino', 'Servillo', 'shows', 'Italian', 'cinema', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'well', '21st', 'century']",N/A

1668335,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00EO87RIW,Turfseer,"[3, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0'The Great Beauty' is the story of Jep Gambardella (Toni Servilo), an aging journalist from Rome who begins a course of self-reflection on the occasion of his 65th birthday. In his younger days, Jep was determined to become the #1 bon vivant amongst the Roman nouveau riche--and succeeded! He published one novel and like many one hit wonders, rested on his laurels and rode into middle age on the coattails of that one success. Jep sustained himself by writing occasional magazine articles with the support of his acerbic magazine editor, Dadina, a dwarf who appears to be instrumental in keeping him afloat, despite his self-doubts.Jep faces a crisis when the husband of a woman who he briefly dated when he was 20, reports that his wife has suddenly died. This is 'The Great Beauty' of the film's title--we see her in a series of flashbacks as Jep muses on the woman 'who got away'. But 'The Great Beauty' has a double meaning--it stands for the collective soul of Rome itself--with its attendant characters, who run the gamut from the profane to the magisterial. Director Paolo Sorrentino takes us on Jep's vibrant, episodic journey, as he interacts with characters from both his past and present.A good part of 'Beauty' is taking in the decadence--fortunately good-natured Jep is the hero here, parrying all the negative talk with the quick wit he's accumulated over the years. Some of the 'lost ones' include a pretentious performance artist who offends Jep by smashing her head into a wall and calling it art and a fellow journalist who he takes apart after she brags about her fame due to the publication of 11 novels by a low rent Marxist press. And Jep wants more from a woman who wants to show him nude photos of herself on her computer since as he says, at his age, he ""wants more.""Jep is thrown for a loop when the 40 year old stripper daughter of a bar owner he hasn't seen for 30 years, dies of AIDS, after they strike up a friendship. While Jep advises not to cry at a funeral because it might upset the family, he does the opposite at the funeral of the disturbed son of a female friend. And when his best friend, Ramono, decides to throw in the towel, give up his playwriting career and return to his hometown, he continues to soldier on, despite his isolation.It's really not clear what turns Jep around from his cynicism to embracing life in all its beauty (which includes despair)--I believe it's his accumulated experiences that causes him to start looking at life as a glass half full, rather than half empty. Beyond the positive, is the sense of awe--perhaps Jep experiences this when he meets the man who's taken a photograph of himself, every day of his life.Religion comes into play at film's end, when the nun is seen taking an injection to cure her of sweaty hands (she needs dry hands to meet the Mother Theresa clone, 'The Saint'). Jep obviously is put off by all the discount Botox doctor's 'takers' including the status seeking nun. Later, the ex-Exorcist Cardinal hardly impresses as a man of faith, with his obsession with culinary delights (as opposed to devotion to spiritual matters). But 'The Saint' appears to be the real deal, as Jep is shocked to find her sleeping on his floor in his apartment. Her devotion to the poor, her sense of sacrifice, proves there's a good side to the church, despite all the failures.Ultimately, it's Jep himself, who represents all that's good about Rome--the man who isn't afraid to look deep into his soul, plume the depths of despair and emerge triumphant. Jep's journey ends where it begins--to a moment in his youth, in all its naivety and simplicity. 'The Great Beauty' sometimes goes on for too long (not sure if I liked all the long-winded party scenes) but nonetheless, 'The Great Beauty' requires obligatory repeat viewings as there is so much food for thought in this most thoughtful, Fellini-like feast.",4,"Multiple welcome interpretations for Sorrentino's plush, Fellini-like feast",1395619200,"03 24, 2014",2014,3949,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '4.5', ""5.0'The"", 'Great', 'Beauty', 'story', 'Jep', 'Gambardella', 'Toni', 'Servilo', 'aging', 'journalist', 'Rome', 'who', 'course', 'self-reflection', 'occasion', '65th', 'birthday', 'younger', 'days', 'Jep', 'was', 'determined', 'become', '1', 'bon', 'vivant', 'Roman', 'nouveau', 'riche', 'succeeded', 'published', 'one', 'novel', 'many', 'one', 'hit', 'wonders', 'rested', 'laurels', 'rode', 'middle', 'age', 'coattails', 'one', 'success', 'Jep', 'sustained', 'writing', 'occasional', 'magazine', 'articles', 'support', 'acerbic', 'magazine', 'editor', 'Dadina', 'dwarf', 'who', 'be', 'instrumental', 'keeping', 'afloat', 'self-doubts.Jep', 'crisis', 'when', 'husband', 'woman', 'who', 'briefly', 'dated', 'when', 'was', '20', 'reports', 'wife', 'suddenly', 'died', ""'The"", 'Great', 'Beauty', 'film', 'title', 'see', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'Jep', 'woman', 'got', 'away', 'Great', 'Beauty', 'double', 'meaning', 'collective', 'soul', 'Rome', 'attendant', 'characters', 'who', 'run', 'gamut', 'profane', 'magisterial', 'Director', 'Paolo', 'Sorrentino', 'Jep', 'vibrant', 'episodic', 'journey', 'characters', 'past', 'present.A', 'good', 'part', ""'Beauty"", 'taking', 'decadence', 'fortunately', 'good-natured', 'Jep', 'hero', 'here', 'parrying', 'negative', 'talk', 'quick', 'wit', 'accumulated', 'years', ""'lost"", 'ones', 'include', 'pretentious', 'performance', 'artist', 'who', 'Jep', 'smashing', 'head', 'wall', 'calling', 'art', 'fellow', 'journalist', 'who', 'apart', 'fame', 'due', 'publication', '11', 'novels', 'low', 'rent', 'Marxist', 'press', 'Jep', 'more', 'woman', 'who', 'show', 'nude', 'photos', 'herself', 'computer', 'age', 'more', 'Jep', 'thrown', 'loop', 'when', '40', 'year', 'old', 'stripper', 'daughter', 'bar', 'owner', ""n't"", 'seen', '30', 'years', 'dies', 'AIDS', 'strike', 'up', 'friendship', 'Jep', 'not', 'cry', 'funeral', 'might', 'upset', 'family', 'opposite', 'funeral', 'disturbed', 'son', 'female', 'friend', 'when', 'best', 'friend', 'Ramono', 'throw', 'towel', 'give', 'up', 'playwriting', 'career', 'return', 'hometown', 'soldier', 'isolation.It', 'really', 'not', 'clear', 'what', 'Jep', 'cynicism', 'embracing', 'life', 'beauty', 'despair', 'believe', 'accumulated', 'experiences', 'start', 'looking', 'life', 'glass', 'half', 'full', 'rather', 'half', 'empty', 'positive', 'sense', 'awe', 'perhaps', 'Jep', 'experiences', 'when', 'man', 'who', 'taken', 'photograph', 'day', 'life.Religion', 'play', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'nun', 'seen', 'taking', 'injection', 'cure', 'sweaty', 'hands', 'dry', 'hands', 'meet', 'Mother', 'Theresa', 'clone', 'Saint', 'Jep', 'obviously', 'put', 'off', 'discount', 'Botox', 'doctor', ""'takers"", 'including', 'status', 'seeking', 'nun', 'Later', 'ex-Exorcist', 'Cardinal', 'hardly', 'man', 'faith', 'obsession', 'culinary', 'delights', 'opposed', 'devotion', 'spiritual', 'matters', 'Saint', 'be', 'real', 'deal', 'Jep', 'shocked', 'find', 'sleeping', 'floor', 'apartment', 'devotion', 'poor', 'sense', 'sacrifice', 'good', 'side', 'church', 'failures.Ultimately', 'Jep', 'who', 'good', 'Rome', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'look', 'deep', 'soul', 'plume', 'depths', 'despair', 'emerge', 'triumphant', 'Jep', 'journey', 'where', 'moment', 'youth', 'naivety', 'simplicity', 'Great', 'Beauty', 'sometimes', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'sure', 'liked', 'long-winded', 'party', 'scenes', 'nonetheless', 'Great', 'Beauty', 'obligatory', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'so', 'much', 'food', 'thought', 'most', 'thoughtful', 'Fellini-like', 'feast']",N/A
