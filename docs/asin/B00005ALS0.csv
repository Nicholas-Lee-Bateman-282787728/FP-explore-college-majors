This is by far my favorite of his movies, and one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's silly,  hilarious, and timely.  It'll make you fall in love with his cast and look for more of his movies.  There's the country boy with his bloodhound, the promiscuous owner with her innocent  husband, the neurotic argumentative couple who only want the best for their dog,and want a prize in the show, the dumb blonde married to a much older man, the gay couple with their little dog, and the commentators.

It's what's known as a mockumentary, a comedy of manners, or an ensemble film. Almost all of this movie is improvised humor. All the actors in this film are extremely talented, they all transform themselves into obsessive dog lovers perfectly. It's the kind of humor seen a lot by the news anchors of ""The Daily Show"". Serious, collected, and awkward, with the result being one of the most unique and clever films ever made.Christopher Guest (Director/Screenwriter) is a genius in this sort of comedy. You may have seen, ""This Is Spinal Tap"", ""Waiting For Guffman"", or ""A Mighty Wind""; all brilliant mockumentaries.To my surprise, not many people I know like this movie. Some people like it, but they don't think it's hilarious like I do.

577492,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00005ALS0,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[22, 27]","Tired of sappy pseudo-screwball comedies, unfunny personalities and forced happy endings?  You've come to the right place.  Gifted satirist/filmmaker Christopher Guest (THIS IS SPINAL TAP; A MIGHTY WIND) literally went to the dogs with this set-at-a-dog-show sendup, but it's the owners, not the dogs, that get sent up.What Guest and co-star/co-author Eugene Levy have done is to craft a kind of comic apotheosis of various ""types"" of Americans at the turn of the millenium.  Count a wonderfully zippy screenplay, a great cast (some of whom go all the way back to SPINAL TAP in the Eighties) who draw on their improvisational skills early and nice tight editing--the show brims with funny, if ironic truths about the way we Yanks view competition and how we, or some of us, live through our dogs and our possessions.  Think of it as an ironic, telegenic WINESBURG, OHIO and you'll understand that while the references aren't arcane, the humor is really of a very high order.Fred Willard plays the TV color man, whose every remark strives for wit but bespeaks a deep, deep ignorance of the topic (""The sporting dogs; those are the 'jocks' of the dog world, aren't they?"")Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are the Swans, a couple of shrill perfectionist yuppies from suburban Chicago. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hare are the Flecks, a very typical middle-class couple from Ohio except that he has two left feet and she has round heels (a running joke in the film, as she is forever running across past lovers, to hubby's consternation).The ever-funny Jane Lynch plays a lesbian kennel owner with an eye for a rich man's wife (Jennifer Coolidge). Michael McKeon and John Michael Higgins are gay beauty-salon operators; the McKeon character could pass for straight but when Higgins' flames, he is a holocaust. And best of all, C. Guest himself plays Harlan Pepper (love that name!), a molasses-mouthed, low-key North Carolina hunter.I won't reveal the outcome but the situation comes from the fact that all these owners' dogs are in final competition for ""Best in show.""  And so much of the dialog rings true, even when a little bizarre, again because of the intelligent script and the prevelance of outstanding improv. players.  The McKeon character casually drops the name of a competitor's salon:  improv.  ""Harlan Pepper"" in true cavalier style demurs when Jane Lynch's character says he SURELY must have HEARD of HER: ""Wull, I have and I haven't.""  Improv!To toss out more of these gems would be to introduce spoilers.

577493,A15S44J4NHU4LS,B00005ALS0,"Alvin Tanhehco ""kerki""","[1, 7]","This film is what a friend of mine calls a ""mock documentary.""  It ""documents"" the obsessive lives of dog-owners as they prepare for a national dog competition.  I put ""documents"" in quotes because what it really ends up doing is making fun of these people.  Each couple ""interviewed"" in the film has their own quirks, none more evident than the manic-depressive Weimaraner of Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock.  (You know how some dog owners end up resembling their pets (or the other way around)?  Parker Posey's look was dead on.)  Christopher Guest ends up being the handler of a bloodhound (and either he owns the dog or is really good with it, because they're awesome together).  Eugene Levy as the husband with two left feet (literally) also cracked me up.I'm not even sure whether the actors stuck to a script because it felt completely improvised as each actor fed on what their fellow actors said.  It's amazing.But, hands down, I thought the highlight of this comedy was Fred Willard as the commentator of the competition.  He is absolutely hilarious.  It's fairly obvious he knows nothing about dog competitions, or dogs for that matter.  It's not even clear how he got the job.  His fellow announcer, an English fellow, is forced to endure Willard's outrageous and dirty remarks while at the same time trying to provide a helpful commentary for the audience.In the same style as Waiting for Guffman, this film is divided into the pre-event, event, and post event interview segments.I recommend this film for people who likes to see things blown out of proportion (figuratively).  It's not a very fast paced film, and lacks any of the qualities that might garner it mass appeal.  But it is a funny look into the even funnier world of dog breeders.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 4 (each character matches their social stereotype to a tee)E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)A (Action) - 0 (n/a)P (Plot) - 1 (dog lovers take their pet to a Best in Show competition)",4,It has its funny moments...,1029974400,"08 22, 2002",2002,2001,"['film', 'what', 'friend', 'mine', 'mock', 'documentary', 'documents', 'obsessive', 'lives', 'dog-owners', 'prepare', 'national', 'dog', 'competition', 'put', 'documents', 'quotes', 'what', 'really', 'up', 'doing', 'making', 'fun', 'people', 'couple', 'interviewed', 'film', 'own', 'quirks', 'none', 'more', 'evident', 'manic-depressive', 'Weimaraner', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Michael', 'Hitchcock', 'know', 'how', 'dog', 'owners', 'end', 'up', 'resembling', 'pets', 'other', 'way', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'look', 'was', 'dead', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'up', 'being', 'handler', 'bloodhound', 'either', 'dog', 'really', 'good', ""'re"", 'awesome', 'together', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'husband', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'literally', 'also', 'cracked', 'up.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'actors', 'stuck', 'script', 'felt', 'completely', 'improvised', 'actor', 'fed', 'what', 'fellow', 'actors', 'said', 'amazing.But', 'down', 'thought', 'highlight', 'comedy', 'was', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'commentator', 'competition', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'nothing', 'dog', 'competitions', 'dogs', 'matter', 'not', 'even', 'clear', 'how', 'got', 'job', 'fellow', 'announcer', 'English', 'fellow', 'forced', 'endure', 'Willard', 'outrageous', 'dirty', 'remarks', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'provide', 'helpful', 'commentary', 'audience.In', 'same', 'style', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'film', 'divided', 'pre-event', 'event', 'post', 'event', 'interview', 'segments.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'likes', 'see', 'things', 'blown', 'proportion', 'figuratively', 'not', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'film', 'qualities', 'might', 'garner', 'mass', 'appeal', 'funny', 'look', 'even', 'funnier', 'world', 'dog', 'breeders.LEAP', 'rating', '5', '============================L', 'Language', '4', 'character', 'social', 'stereotype', 'tee', 'E', 'Erotica', '0', 'n/a', 'A', 'Action', '0', 'n/a', 'P', 'Plot', '1', 'dog', 'lovers', 'take', 'pet', 'Best', 'Show', 'competition']",Best in Show

577499,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005ALS0,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","To me `Best in Show' is one of the funniest films I've ever seen.  I still can't remember a time when I laughed so hard, I mean truly laughed uncontrollably; complete with tears and those annoying giggles that everyone around you hates to hear.  That's probably the biggest compliment I can give this brilliant film.  It's truly, from top to bottom, beginning to end, one hundred percent hilarious.  Christopher Guest has his fans and supporters, and anyone who's seen his films will immediately find familiar the execution of the material.  In `Best in Show' though I'm tempted to say Guest and company are at their best.  I've seen all of Guest's films and `Best in Show' is by far my favorite.  The entire cast seems on point and together.  Their scenes are downright knee slapping hilarious, and everyone seems to have a full understanding of the character they are trying to be.  With every adlibbed line `Best in Show' gets better and better.So the film follows a group of dog owners as they ready themselves for national competition.  Each couple is as unique as the dog their preparing and each actor brings their own light to their scenes.  The first couple we meet are Meg and Hamilton Swan, a young couple who share braces, Starbucks and their love of their Weimaraner in common.  Both Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock take home the best-in-show title here for their brilliant comedic performances are just outstanding and their scenes alone are the most memorable of the film.  Their neurotic, passionate, annoying and peppy and it works brilliantly.  Cookie and Gerry Fleck, played by Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy, also work wonders as owners of a Terrier.  O'Hara is hilarious as the less than innocent Cookie, and Levy, whom I'm a huge fan of, is great as her paranoid husband.  Christopher Guest himself is great as Harlan Pepper, the owner of a bloodhound and John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean are hilarious as Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof, the gay couple sporting a pair of Shih Tzu's.  Jane Lynch, Jennifer Coolidge and Patrick Cranshaw stand out though as the three's company of the group, Jennifer playing Sherri Ann Ward Cabot, an Anna Nicole knockoff who married old for money no doubt.  Jane Lynch plays her Poodle's trainer and her disclosed lover.The film, shot as a mockumentary, is splendidly executed.  The script is really nothing more than an outline of events for the cast is allowed to take the material and run with it infusing a sense of realism in the most exaggerated and outlandish of ways.  It works wonderfully.  The audience is never given a chance to get bored with or tired of the film but is constantly kept entertained.  I have nothing even remotely negative to say about this film.

Guest takes the least-showy role of soft spoken Southerner, Harlan Pepper (a far cry from Guffman's flamboyant Corky St. Clair), and surrounds himself with the likes of Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy as a woman with a dubious sexual past and her hapless husband; Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock as a strident yuppie couple who tear into one another mercilessly over what's best for their beloved dog; Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins as a middle class gay couple who sing their dog lullabyes over the phone; and the hilarious Jennifer Coolidge (in a send-up of Anna Nicole Smith) as a vapid fortune hunter married to an ancient millionaire while maintaining a curiously close relationship with their dog trainer played by Jane Lynch.  The movie has a gentle, lilting feel, humorous but not screamingly funny, and takes time to develop these characters fully while exploring the tense and cut-throat world of dog shows.  Fred Willard nearly steals the show as a pompous, ignorant commentator.  There are so many wonderful moments in this film, you have to check it out for yourself.  Not for everyone, I'm sure.

I've watched the Westminster dog show on television a couple of times-Danes almost never win best in show-so I've gotten a feel for the venue, and the movie has captured it right down to the interviews with the sponsor and various dog owners and the chatty repartee of the narrators.The work is done much in the style of another ""interview"" film, This is Spinal Tap, and like that work, this one is just as convincing despite the outrageous behavior of some of the characters.  So talented were the various actors that I actually believed they were what they suggested they were.  It wasn't until my husband pointed out that he'd seem them in other comedic parts that he was able to convince me that they weren't part of the dog show milieu.My favorite character was the owner of the blood hound (Christopher Guest, the director himself) whose conversation was so deadly dull that he could glaze the eyes of his listeners.

The film follows 5 different couples and their respected dogs traveling to compete in the all important 'Best Of Show' dog show. Playing the people are a wide range of great talent. Former SCTV co-stars Catherine 'O' Hara and Eugene Levy(who co-wrote with Guest)appear as a couple with the wife running into a number of old sexual partners. Another is the great Michael McKean as part of a gay couple. I can't remember the other guy's name. Then you have Jennifer Coolidge(American Pie, Legally Blonde)as a rich blonde and her rather butch-ish dog handler(Played by Jane Lynch). Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock play a yuppy-ish couple who go to therapy because they think their dog has been damaged by seeing them have sex. And, finally, the last person is Guest himself. He plays Harlan Pepper, a southerner with a deep accent who also longs to be a ventriloquist. Very rich and well developed characters. As I've mentioned, the film is done in the 'documentary' style. Not everybody goes for that. I find it to be refreshing and funny. ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" is another ""mockumentary"" favorite of mine. Guest is no doubt a comedy genius. He has an incredible knack for finding the funny in incredibly unfunny things. He is a master. Catherine 'O' Hara's running joke about running into old sex partners could've been used to exhaustion, but thankfully, the makers only had it happen three times, so it doesn't lose the humor. Alas, I have saved the best for last. I'm talking about the great Fred Willard. How great is this man?. He's been around forever always doing a good job. This guy was perfect as the dog show announcer who just blurts out rather odd and hilarious dialogue throughout the show. Hilarious.

My adulation for his unique and always-clever works cannot be expressed within the course of a lifetime.  He has the most intriguing directing style I've come across, hands down.  Pure improv, allowing each cast member to sit and vent/contemplate for 10 minutes at a time, and then later goes back to edit and seal the final masterpiece.  This movie caused many belly-laughs and moments where I was chuckling so hard, zero noise was coming out.  The premise for this movie and his other mockumentaries have been fantastic, no other person would have the gusto or the skill to go forth and expose these all-to-common real life scenarios like Guest has.  He has consistantly created characters who are unforgettable (the mark of a great comedian) and his ability to improvise is astounding; vocabulary constitutes a big part of successful comedy, and Guest obviously has a stunning array of one-liners and collected phrases that seem to come out with picture-perfect timing.  Moving onward to members of his cast: Michael Mckean does such a great job of expressing himself on screen, he accomplishes this by speaking in a relaxed, yet semi self-crazed tone.  ""She tries to be so self-possessed but look at the face, she's full of fear.""  Parker Posey plays the Mrs. Swan role with absolute ability, her reactions are wild, ""I got in a position that was very painful, emotionally, for me.  It's called 'congress of the cow.'""  Fred Willard made the last half of the film memorable and hilarious, his commentary is original and breathtaking.  Fred often gets critized, but I'd like to see anyone else come up with the lines that he instinctly lets fly.  Now back to Guest: his knowledge of flyfishing made me fall out of my chair, ""You could use a Disco Midge, a Beadhead, a Patch Adams.""  While driving in his RV he unleashes a flurry of comedy all by way of making you believe this is an old boy who loves his dog and knows his nuts!  (Please see the additional scenes, there is extra footage of him talking about ""phantom hill"" and ""turtle woman"").  My favorite portion of the DVD happens to be the additional scenes.  From ""Harlan and Arrowheads"" (which is a gut-buster) to ""Stephan at the Salon"", can you ask for anything more?  Mckean is so god-damn-funny that it makes one ponder how this bit didn't wind up in the theatrical version?  ""The French don't know anything about shampooing.  If you're wondering about a shampooing sink go straight to the Dutch!"" haha.  Or ""We bought out the Chinese.  Not the nation, but you know, that little chapter behind the wall."" ah haha.

Fortunately, we have a mutt so we can't enter a dog show which is the focus of this film.  Dog shows: what a world!  It's hard to say who is funniest, everyone involved is so hilarious, from the owners to the people who run the show to the media and so on down the line.  The dog owners are quirky characters to a person.  There are married couples, a gay couple, a lesbian couple and, of course, one from each couple is assigned to show the dog in the ring.  Plus they all stay in the same hotel which allows dogs due to the annual show.  There's also a dog shrink with the dog owners and the dog seeing him.  We actually knew a psychologist for people who shared space with a dog shrink so this is true to home as well.  There is an announcer from the media who is Mr. Obnoxious who will say absolutely anything no matter how insulting or inappropriate. Fred Willard, who played him, almost walked away with the movie in that role.

And it's even better when you consider that this fake documentary was essentially unscripted - I didn't know this until about halfway through, myself. Christopher Guest (the mastermind behind This Is Spinal Tap) seems to have just kind of told everyone who their characters were and set some guidelines as to where he wanted them to go and then let them improvise the rest. It works pretty well, too, the vast majority of the time.At first I was a little worried - the opening sequence in which all the main sets of characters are introduced is a bit dodgy. But it can't be helped, those scenes set the stage for everything that comes later. Once you've got a handle on who these people are, the hilarity is essentially non-stop. No-one gets spared: Gays, white trash, gold-diggers, yuppies, colour commentators... they all get lampooned - one or more of them is bound to remind you of someone you know, that's for sure!I think my favourite characters were the overwrought yuppie couple (Parker Posey is especially good, as always). Others will doubtless choose the gay couple, since John Michael Higgins' Scott is one of the funnier send-ups of a flamboyant gay man in recent memory. Fred Willard's clueless announcer is exasperating and hilarious by turns. And, of course, everyone gets plenty of laughs out of Cookie's promiscuous past! I especially enjoyed the general theme of parodying people who take themselves just a bit too seriously.The DVD doesn't have a whole lot of extras, but those it has are well-suited to the film.

Rather, he reveals some of the unpretty underbelly of the contest world (this time it's dog shows) and allows the audience to reach its own conclusions.As in Waiting for Guffman, we're presented with a panoply of exotics and neurotics and allowed to watch them (and their doggies) try to win the top prize (in Guffman, it was a shot at Broadway.)

Unfortunately, I was highly disappointed by Best in Show.The first reason, I think, is the lack of music. Other films of this ilk have an additional layer of music that makes for a fuller experience as the songs are often as funny as the film. Additionally, Best in Show has not one likable character in it. The thing about This is Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, and even A Mighty Wind is that you identify with the characters while you laugh at them. Every dog owner is--if not entirely despicable like the pair played by Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey (and I like both actors immensely)--so bland as to be uninteresting. Tack onto that the prevalence of easy jokes (the two gay couples and the just awful ""two left feet"" gag that never pays off) and you end up with a lesser film that could have been so much better. The funniest part to me is Fred Willard's turn as ignorant commentator.Of course, this is only my opinion as there seem to be many people who love this film.

Then there's Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest himself), a southern bloodhound owner who dreams of being a ventriloquist.  And there's power comic couple Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who play the Flecks, owners of a terrier, who struggle with Mrs. Flecks long line of previous lovers.  There are lovers Stefan & Scott (Michael McKean & John Michael Higgins) who spoil their Shih Tzu's and each other.  But finally we have the star couple of the show, the neurotic Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey & Michael Hitchcock), owners of Beatrice, and beautiful yet disturbed and `negative' Weimaraner who's been traumatized by the sight of this young couple having sex.  Their antics, arguments and strange affection to their dog is some of the funniest scenes in the whole film, and their chemistry is pure brilliance.

It is these, however, who are likely to be most disappointed.  Just as historians cannot enjoy films like 'Elizabeth' because Francis Walsingham WASN'T wearing a chestnut buskin in his interview with the Queen on the 15th of October, 1572, so dog-owners will wonder why the realities of dogs - toilet problems; rolling over for rubs; the wide-eyed expectancy; the cunning gamesmanship; the shameless expeditions for 'perfume'; the talkative yawns; the curious sniffing of admirers; the yearning whimpers; the frank demands for your food etc. - are absent.  This is because the film's focus is firmly on the largely psychotic 'handlers', whose mania for success has turned animals they are supposed to love into over-trained automatons.  When the depressed Weimaraner, bullied and shrieked at by his appalling owners, finally lashes out and deliberately loses the contest for them, you can only cheer.'Best in Show' is very much a film of two halves.  The first shows the owvers preparing for and travelling to the show.  Here the (improvised) material is content to settle for lazy caricature, and it is up to some amazing comedians - including 'Spinal Tap' veterans Christopher Guest and Michael McKean; Catherine O'Hara; co-writer Eugene Levy - to enliven it.The second half, at the dog show itself, is superb.  This is because an unimaginative formal device - the use of commentators to explain the mechanics of these shows - turns out to be an inspired comic coup.  Fred Willard is a delightfully crass and bemused showman, stating the obvious and puerile with scatalogical glee, suggesting... improvements (bloodhounds should where deerstalkers and pipes a la Sherlock Holmes!); his squirming, English co-commentator, a dog expert with a string of Obedience Schools tries in vain to restore sobriety to the reportage.  The straight man/vulgar buffoon double act is hysterical in its own right, and galvanises the main narrative, their commentary on it making the handlers' activities hilarious.'Best In Show' could never hope to equal 'Spinal Tap'.  Not only is the material not as funny, nor does the caricatured narrative arc allow the unexpected poignancy of the first film, but dog shows, a marginal activity, simply don't have the enormous cultural and emotional cache of rock music, which really does teeter on the brink of sublimity and ridiculousness.

The film was also nominated for and won awards from many different groups such as the American Cinema Editors, Boston Society of Film Critics, British Comedy Awards, Canadian Comedy Awards, the Golden Globes and many more.This DVD includes an audio commentary by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy which is somewhat low-key, but there are some very funny moments if you pay close attention. Also available are quite a few deleted scenes.  You will also find the features which are almost standard at this point, such as a trailer and cast/filmmaker profiles.

Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara) are a couple from Florida; he's a nerd with two left feet (literally) and she is a former ""reformed"" tramp who seems to have old trick pop up at the most inopportune times. Meg & Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey & Michael Hitchcock) are a couple who put their dog in therapy because the dog saw them having sex and appears to be traumatized. Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest) is a hick from North Carolina with a bloodhound. Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) is the trainer for the favored dob, owned by Sherri Ann Ward Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge), a kind-hearted bimbo who is married to a rich old geezer. A Shih Tzu owned by a flamboyant gay couple, Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins) & Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean), is also part of the competition.

No slow-moving moments (other than Guest's sequences) and Coolidge steals the show. So many memorable one-liners  here.

I watched it again with the commentary on and then watched the extra scenes, which I almost never sit still for on a DVD.The most remarkable part is that the dialogue is improvised by the actors--director (and star) Christopher Guest and co-writer (and star) Eugene Levy wrote the story.  During the shooting, each scene was explained to the actors who then improvised the dialogue.  The technique gives the ""mockumentary"" a very realistic feel.  Comedian Fred Willard has an amazing part as the ""dumb as a hammer"" TV commentator, who in one scene quizzes the dog show's director on the relationship between Mayflower and Philadelphia (a no brainer, he calls it, but then goes on to report that Columbus didn't actually pilot the Mayflower into Philadelphia, but to somewhere in the West Indies).

Christopher Guest, who has made comedic improv ""mockumentaries"" an art form, hits the funny bone yet again with his ensemble cast of lovable loons who take competitive dog showing just a tad too seriously.Improvisational comedy takes a special talent, so Guest employs several Second City veterans to wing it in front of the camera (including Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Michael McKean, and Fred Willard).  While Guest's character (whose name is Harlan Pepper, a classic) and Fred Willard (an empty suit TV announcer) tend to get annoying, the rest of the cast improvs and interacts in pure comedic camaraderie.

While ""Best"" is still a fun and frenetic mockumentary, it isn't up to the standards of its sibling mockumentaries -- it's a little too repetitive and over-the-top.Welcome to Philadelphia, the home of the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show. Among the crazy dog owners are Starbucks yuppies Hamilton and Meg Swan (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey), gay couple Scott and Stefan (John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean), ventrilogist hick Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest), and buxom airhead Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge) and her lover/trainer Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch). Front and center is two-left-footed Gerry Fleck (Eugene Levy) and his wife Cookie (Catherine O'Hara), whose sexy past keeps coming back to haunt her.All these people converge at the dog show, and face difficulties ranging from wrenched knees to televised lesbian smooches to lost squeaky toys -- and some of the dogs are getting a bit crazy as well. With an obnoxious commentator watching over it all, they all strive for the ultimate prize. Poodle, Norwich terrier, bloodhound, Shih Tzu or emotionally scarred Weimaraner -- who will be best in show?""Best in Show"" does for dog shows what ""This is Spinal Tap"" did for old metal -- it makes affectionate fun of them. Christopher Guest returns to mockumentary turf in the moderately funny ""Best in Show"" -- it's flawed, but still far above the average comedy.The biggest problem with ""Best in Show"" is that Guest tries too hard. The jokes and goofiness are over-the-top, belying the mockumentary format. And the jokes get a bit repetitive. How many times can Cookie run into old boyfriends? Isn't the gay humor both cliched and overdone? But, the humor itself is quite funny, with plenty of strange lines like ""We have so much in common! We both love soup... and the outdoors... snow peas... talking and not talking. We could not talk or talk forever and still find things to not talk about.""No flaws can be found in the veteran mockumentary cast -- these people look like they're having a good time. Hitchcock and Posey are chillingly good as the couple who met over J. Crew catalogues in a Starbucks, while Coolidge is deliciously dumb as a bisexual Anna Nicole Smith clone. McKean and Higgins, despite being cliched, play their roles with unadulterated delight. Fred Willard's vulgar commentator is over-the-top stupid, but still amusing.Despite repetitive humor and the occasional dud joke, Christopher Guest's follow-up to ""Waiting for Guffman"" is an amusing look behind the scenes of dog shows.

577557,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005ALS0,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 4]","All of Christopher Guest's comic mastery as our premiere mockumentarian is on full display here, yet I have never warmed up to this movie the same way I did with ""Waiting for Guffman"". I think there are two reasons. First, the diversity of characters in ""Best in Show"", spread across socioeconomic classes and geographic distances, doesn't produce as inherently likable or close-knit a group as the good citizens of Blaine, Missouri.  Second, the concept of a first-person interview movie will inevitably feel less fresh the second time around, especially when many of the same actors are being cast. These concessions aside, this is still an extremely funny movie with an edginess that makes ""Waiting for Guffman"" feel all the more innocent.The plot revolves around the fictional Mayflower Dog Show, a Westminster look-alike, being held in Philadelphia, and the eccentric gallery of dog lovers vying for the blue ribbon. First, we have Gerry and Cookie Fleck, played by Eugene Levy (who like ""Guffman"", co-wrote the witty script with Guest) and Catherine O'Hara, with their Norwich terrier, Winky. In Levy's hands, Gerry is a blood brother to his previous Dr. Pearl but this time, his character has two left feet...literally...and a satisfying moment of victory Pearl could never experience. O'Hara ebulliently makes Cookie a likeable nymphomaniac with a heart of gold.  John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean play an affectionate and flamboyant gay couple, with their Shih Tzu, Miss Agnes. While Higgins lays on the double entendres pretty thick, McKean actually provides a nice balance to their relationship, and the combination makes for more than a ""Birdcage"" knock-off.There is also the yuppie couple from hell, high-strung and high-maintenance lawyers Meg and Hamilton Swan, played with uncompromising fury by Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock, who spoil their Weimaraner, Beatrice, mercilessly. Posey, in a severe turnabout from her lackadaisical Dairy Queen waitress in ""Guffman"", is particularly strong and edgy at playing the neurotic harpy in search of the elusive bumblebee squeaky toy. With her collagen-injected lips and heavily suctioned breasts, the comically zaftig Jennifer Coolidge plays an Anna Nicole Smith-like trophy wife who comes out of the closet to her hyper-competitive trainer, portrayed by Jane Lynch, with their poodle, Rhapsody in White, in tow. And Guest downshifts from his previous Corky St. Clair significantly to play soft-spoken Harlan Pepper, a red-haired bait-and-tackle shop owner from the backwoods of North Carolina, who loves his devoted bloodhound, Hubert.  For all the comic brilliance generated by the actors playing the dog owners, the show is stolen by the comically irrelevant ranting of Fred Willard, who plays a most idiotic sportscaster who doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. Everyone exhibits sharp improvisational skills, as the press notes indicate that the actors were only given a script outline and encouraged to shape their characters onscreen with no rehearsal.In the commentary, Guest mentions sixty hours of footage were produced to make this ninety-minute laugh fest. The effort was worth it, as there is not a moment wasted in this comedy. I only wish it inherited some more of the heart of ""Guffman"" to relieve us from the more scabrous parts of the script. The DVD unsurprisingly has several deleted scenes, all worth seeing for the contextual information they provide about the characters.",4,Dog Show Pressures Lend Edge to Guest's Clever Mockumentary,1109462400,"02 27, 2005",2005,3470,"['Christopher', 'Guest', 'comic', 'mastery', 'premiere', 'mockumentarian', 'full', 'display', 'here', 'yet', 'have', 'never', 'warmed', 'up', 'movie', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'think', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'diversity', 'characters', 'Best', 'Show', 'spread', 'socioeconomic', 'classes', 'geographic', 'distances', ""n't"", 'produce', 'inherently', 'likable', 'close-knit', 'group', 'good', 'citizens', 'Blaine', 'Missouri', 'Second', 'concept', 'first-person', 'interview', 'movie', 'will', 'inevitably', 'feel', 'less', 'fresh', 'second', 'time', 'especially', 'when', 'many', 'same', 'actors', 'are', 'being', 'cast', 'concessions', 'aside', 'still', 'extremely', 'funny', 'movie', 'edginess', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'feel', 'more', 'innocent.The', 'plot', 'revolves', 'fictional', 'Mayflower', 'Dog', 'Show', 'Westminster', 'look-alike', 'being', 'held', 'Philadelphia', 'eccentric', 'gallery', 'dog', 'lovers', 'vying', 'blue', 'ribbon', 'First', 'have', 'Gerry', 'Cookie', 'Fleck', 'played', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'who', 'Guffman', 'co-wrote', 'witty', 'script', 'Guest', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Norwich', 'terrier', 'Winky', 'Levy', 'hands', 'Gerry', 'blood', 'brother', 'previous', 'Dr.', 'Pearl', 'time', 'character', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'literally', 'satisfying', 'moment', 'victory', 'Pearl', 'could', 'never', 'experience', ""O'Hara"", 'ebulliently', 'Cookie', 'likeable', 'nymphomaniac', 'heart', 'gold', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'play', 'affectionate', 'flamboyant', 'gay', 'couple', 'Shih', 'Tzu', 'Miss', 'Agnes', 'Higgins', 'double', 'entendres', 'pretty', 'thick', 'McKean', 'actually', 'nice', 'balance', 'relationship', 'combination', 'more', 'Birdcage', 'knock-off.There', 'also', 'yuppie', 'couple', 'hell', 'high-strung', 'high-maintenance', 'lawyers', 'Meg', 'Hamilton', 'Swan', 'played', 'uncompromising', 'fury', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Michael', 'Hitchcock', 'who', 'spoil', 'Weimaraner', 'Beatrice', 'mercilessly', 'Posey', 'severe', 'turnabout', 'lackadaisical', 'Dairy', 'Queen', 'waitress', 'Guffman', 'particularly', 'strong', 'edgy', 'playing', 'neurotic', 'harpy', 'search', 'elusive', 'bumblebee', 'squeaky', 'toy', 'collagen-injected', 'lips', 'heavily', 'suctioned', 'breasts', 'comically', 'zaftig', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Smith-like', 'trophy', 'wife', 'who', 'closet', 'hyper-competitive', 'trainer', 'portrayed', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'poodle', 'Rhapsody', 'White', 'tow', 'Guest', 'downshifts', 'previous', 'Corky', 'St.', 'Clair', 'significantly', 'play', 'soft-spoken', 'Harlan', 'Pepper', 'red-haired', 'bait-and-tackle', 'shop', 'owner', 'backwoods', 'North', 'Carolina', 'who', 'devoted', 'bloodhound', 'Hubert', 'comic', 'brilliance', 'generated', 'actors', 'playing', 'dog', 'owners', 'show', 'stolen', 'comically', 'irrelevant', 'ranting', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'who', 'most', 'idiotic', 'sportscaster', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'talking', 'Everyone', 'sharp', 'improvisational', 'skills', 'press', 'notes', 'indicate', 'actors', 'were', 'only', 'given', 'script', 'outline', 'encouraged', 'shape', 'characters', 'rehearsal.In', 'commentary', 'Guest', 'mentions', 'sixty', 'hours', 'footage', 'were', 'produced', 'make', 'ninety-minute', 'laugh', 'fest', 'effort', 'was', 'worth', 'not', 'moment', 'wasted', 'comedy', 'only', 'wish', 'inherited', 'more', 'heart', 'Guffman', 'relieve', 'more', 'scabrous', 'parts', 'script', 'DVD', 'unsurprisingly', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'worth', 'seeing', 'contextual', 'information', 'provide', 'characters']",Best in Show

We meet a number of characters, including a gay couple, a neurotic couple, a man who operates a fishing shop, and so on. We see them in their daily lives, follow them in their trip to the dog show, and the happenings there.The most interesting thing about Best in Show is its narrative structure - mainly composed of sustained shots of individuals or couples, documentary-style, talking at the camera as if they were being interviewed about their lives and what they are doing at the moment.It is interesting to watch, but this movie is not funny. It has few laughs in it, and the attempts are ham-handed. For example, we see a man who literally has two left feet, or a gay couple which decorates its hotel room. Is this stuff funny ? Sure, if you've never seen a comedy before.  In fact, the funniest scene on the DVD is not in the movie, but a deleted scene - where Harlan Pepper (the most interesting character, in my opinion) talks about the degrees of greatness of his dog's nose compared to a space shuttle, and it is a scene which is not only funny but works on many levels.I'd say this symbolizes what this movie could have been. We don't care about the dog show, except as a framework, and the scenes involving it are not very funny. We want to see more of these people - at least the more three-dimensional ones.

577577,A1Y8IUMN7TBKS,B00005ALS0,Groovy Vegan,"[1, 1]","""Best in Show"" is a usually-funny unscripted parody of the renowned Westminster Kennel Club dog show and the obsessed dog-show handlers and owners of the dog-show world.  Director/writer/actor Christopher Guest and Writer/actor Eugene Levy, wrote a detailed plot outline.  But they left the dialogue for the actors to improv.  If you haven't been to a dog show nor have seen Westminster on TV, you only have an endless string of off-color jokes to keep you entertained.  But if you've observed the dog-show culture, even briefly, the movie's parody of Westminster and the crazed dog-show humans it attracts becomes even funnier.The movie has the feel of Westminster down to the green carpet, and benching area where people obsess over every detail of their dog's appearance.  Just as Westminster has its official hotel, the pet-friendly, New York Hotel Martinique, ""Best in Show"" has its official pet-friendly hotel too, complete with a utility closet full of Nature's Miracle and other dog-leavings clean-up products.But what makes the movie truly funny are the parodies of the types of people often found entering dog shows.  The funniest IMO was the gay couple who show up for a 2-day stay at the hotel loaded with kimonos and facial mud, and who even hung  artwork on the walls.  The majorly annoying neurotic Yuppie couple with the neurotic Weimaraner was also funny, particularly if you've had the misfortune of meeting somebody like that.  The interplay between the Norwich Terrier owner who kept running into ex-boyfriends and the reaction of her nerdy husband, played by Eugene Levy was also quite amusing.Unfortunately, although I thought Christopher Guest's bloodhound was adorable and had a lot of personality, I thought his ""hillbilly schtick"" every time he opened his mouth was rather boring.  Although he had IMO the funniest character in his first mockumentary ""This is Spinal Tap,"" I found his character in this movie to be the least interesting.  (Just focus on his bloodhound who is full of personality if you're bored in those sections.)Overall, I liked this movie.

577589,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,B00005ALS0,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[2, 2]","This movie is unquestionably PG-13.  I found this movie a bit too vulgar in many places.  But that does not change the fact that this was a very funny movie, and very well done.There are deleted scenes included after the VHS version of this product.  Those scenes weren't at all bad -- some of them were deleted because the movie went a different direction with a couple of the aftermath stories, while others would have just made the movie longer.  The deletion of the scenes shows that they made the movie just the correct length and knew when to stop.  Other movies went on to a part of boredom, and this movie did not.I am doing research on dog shows for a novel I'm writing.  ""Best In Show"" is not making fun of dog shows but rather having fun with them.  From the audience's point of view, the stars are the dogs.  With the exception of Beatrice the Weimaraner, the dogs didn't really contribute to the movie.  In the movie, the focus was on the characters.A couple of reviews say people take dog shows too seriously, and some do but for others it's an enjoyable hobby.  For example, I went to an agility show and it seems to be where people and dogs can have fun together.  The conformity part, which is where this movie focuses (there are also obedience trials and herding as well as agility, and the same dog may compete in several of these events), is more of the beauty pagaent, but the reality is it is a group of animal lovers.  Some are as quirky as the characters in the movie, but not all.One strength was the low key approach to the movie.  John Michael Higgins and Fred Willard have stand out performances, but they would be best described as ""flamboyant"" rather than over the top.  While there is some suspension of disbelief in this movie (e.g. Eugene Levy's character having two left feet), the characters are all realistic and not removed from real life.  My hunch is that if a viewer is rooting for a certain character it is a subjective choice, and a different viewer may identify just as strongly with a different character.  There are no antagonists.  The only character I was hoping wouldn't win were the two-time defending champion, just because they were the two-time defending champion (I have the same view in sports as well).The casting is perfect.  There are hints of improv in here.  It doesn't have a completely unscripted feeling but there are parts where I have a hunch that an actor has his own script but does not know (or at least does not expect) what another actor will say.  My favorite joke is that the Yuppie couple met at Starbucks -- not the same Starbucks:  they saw each other in different Starbucks across the street from each other.  (I also liked the ""Phantom Hill"" joke in the extra scenes.)I've never watched the Spinal Tap movie (or Guffman) but I saw the TV special.  Christopher Guest and Michael McKean (one of my favorite comic actors) were in the TV version.  I think I caught a Spinal Tap allusion when the hotel manager was talking about a rock band staying there.The quality of the artmanship earned this movie the five stars I'm giving it.  I was embarrassed and disgusted with parts of this movie, because of my world view.  Likewise, I would not recommend that children see this movie.  What is needed is a straight PG (if not G) rated movie on dog shows so that children can enjoy the story as well.",5,"This movie is based on a different worldview, but it is well done.",1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,3366,"['movie', 'unquestionably', 'PG-13', 'found', 'movie', 'bit', 'too', 'vulgar', 'many', 'places', 'not', 'change', 'fact', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'VHS', 'version', 'product', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'were', 'deleted', 'movie', 'went', 'different', 'direction', 'couple', 'aftermath', 'stories', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'made', 'movie', 'longer', 'deletion', 'scenes', 'made', 'movie', 'just', 'correct', 'length', 'knew', 'when', 'stop', 'Other', 'movies', 'went', 'part', 'boredom', 'movie', 'did', 'not.I', 'am', 'doing', 'research', 'dog', 'shows', 'novel', ""'m"", 'writing', 'Best', 'Show', 'not', 'making', 'fun', 'dog', 'shows', 'rather', 'having', 'fun', 'audience', 'point', 'view', 'stars', 'are', 'dogs', 'exception', 'Beatrice', 'Weimaraner', 'dogs', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'contribute', 'movie', 'movie', 'focus', 'was', 'characters.A', 'couple', 'reviews', 'say', 'people', 'take', 'dog', 'shows', 'too', 'seriously', 'do', 'others', 'enjoyable', 'hobby', 'example', 'went', 'agility', 'show', 'be', 'where', 'people', 'dogs', 'can', 'have', 'fun', 'together', 'conformity', 'part', 'where', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'obedience', 'trials', 'herding', 'as', 'well', 'agility', 'same', 'dog', 'may', 'compete', 'several', 'events', 'more', 'beauty', 'pagaent', 'reality', 'group', 'animal', 'lovers', 'are', 'as', 'quirky', 'characters', 'movie', 'not', 'all.One', 'strength', 'was', 'low', 'key', 'approach', 'movie', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'have', 'stand', 'out', 'performances', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'described', 'flamboyant', 'rather', 'top', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'movie', 'e.g', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'character', 'having', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'characters', 'are', 'realistic', 'not', 'removed', 'real', 'life', 'hunch', 'viewer', 'rooting', 'certain', 'character', 'subjective', 'choice', 'different', 'viewer', 'may', 'identify', 'just', 'strongly', 'different', 'character', 'are', 'antagonists', 'only', 'character', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', ""n't"", 'win', 'were', 'two-time', 'defending', 'champion', 'just', 'were', 'two-time', 'defending', 'champion', 'have', 'same', 'view', 'sports', 'well', '.The', 'casting', 'perfect', 'are', 'hints', 'improv', 'here', ""n't"", 'have', 'completely', 'unscripted', 'feeling', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'have', 'hunch', 'actor', 'own', 'script', 'not', 'know', 'least', 'not', 'expect', 'what', 'actor', 'will', 'say', 'favorite', 'joke', 'Yuppie', 'couple', 'met', 'Starbucks', 'not', 'same', 'Starbucks', 'saw', 'other', 'different', 'Starbucks', 'street', 'other', 'also', 'liked', 'Phantom', 'Hill', 'joke', 'extra', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'movie', 'Guffman', 'saw', 'TV', 'special', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'one', 'favorite', 'comic', 'actors', 'were', 'TV', 'version', 'think', 'caught', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'allusion', 'when', 'hotel', 'manager', 'was', 'talking', 'rock', 'band', 'staying', 'there.The', 'quality', 'artmanship', 'earned', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', ""'m"", 'giving', 'was', 'embarrassed', 'disgusted', 'parts', 'movie', 'world', 'view', 'Likewise', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'children', 'see', 'movie', 'What', 'needed', 'straight', 'PG', 'not', 'G', 'rated', 'movie', 'dog', 'shows', 'children', 'can', 'enjoy', 'story', 'as', 'well']",Best in Show

Finally, I rolled over and fetched a copy. Now, I can tell him not only that I watched this film, but that I virtually wolfed it down.""Best in Show"" follows a handful of hopefuls for the coveted top prize at the fictional Mayflower Kennel Dog Show, held in Philadelphia. The film is a mocumentary in which the participants are shown (as by a film crew) in their homes, in interviews, with their friends and preparing for the show. The participants hail from all over the US and represent identifiable types. There's the gay couple, the Southern good-ol' boy, the nerd, the slut, the beauty queen, the irritable yuppies and the lesbian. The characters rarely interact directly -- a scene in which flamboyant Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins) tries to freak out straight-laced Gerry Fleck (Eugene Levy) is an exception -- and are usually shown in private moments with their animals. We meet a harried hotel manager, the show's fusty manager and the out-tight kennel club president. We also meet the media, in the personages of Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), an airheaded, sex-obsessed TV host, and Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock), his exasperated dog-expert sidekick. The humor is neither subtle nor mean, and never lets up.The selection of stereotyped characters is hilarious and is generally played sympathetically, but is occasionally predictable. The gay couple fussily redecorates its hotel room -- replacing pillows and tacking up wall coverings. The yuppie couple is neurotically obsessed with clothing brands, psychiatrists and Starbucks. The laconic Southern gentleman runs a fishing gear store and dreams of being a ventriloquist. Funny as it is, the film often takes its parody a bit too close to (and occasionally over the edge of) believability. One character's wife keeps running into old boyfriends who are a bit too graphic in their reminiscences. A bit of restraint here would have gotten the message across better. Still, the DVD's deleted scenes show that material that stretched the characters even further out of shape was mercifully left out of the final product.All in all, ""Best in Show"" was an enjoyable way to spend a Saturday evening. Uncharacteristically, my wife and I laughed out loud quite often. Over-the-top characterizations aside, the film's depictions of the dog show world are fairly accurate (according to my friend, who would know), down to the cast of actually championship dogs. Comedy aside, I found the dog show world fascinating and would love to attend an event. Which goes to show that Christopher Guest's treatments -- whether of heavy metal, folk music or dog shows -- are always loving homages to the eccentricities of the participants and celebrations of their unique contributions to our culture.",4,"Terrific, loving and hilarious satire",1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,2843,"['dog-loving', 'friend', 'wife', 'judges', 'dog', 'shows', 'been', 'hounding', 'watch', 'film', 'years', 'Finally', 'rolled', 'over', 'fetched', 'copy', 'Now', 'can', 'tell', 'not', 'only', 'watched', 'film', 'virtually', 'wolfed', 'down', 'Best', 'Show', 'handful', 'hopefuls', 'coveted', 'top', 'prize', 'fictional', 'Mayflower', 'Kennel', 'Dog', 'Show', 'held', 'Philadelphia', 'film', 'mocumentary', 'participants', 'are', 'shown', 'film', 'crew', 'homes', 'interviews', 'friends', 'preparing', 'show', 'participants', 'hail', 'US', 'represent', 'identifiable', 'types', 'gay', 'couple', 'Southern', 'good-ol', 'boy', 'nerd', 'slut', 'beauty', 'queen', 'irritable', 'yuppies', 'lesbian', 'characters', 'rarely', 'interact', 'directly', 'scene', 'flamboyant', 'Scott', 'Donlan', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'freak', 'out', 'straight-laced', 'Gerry', 'Fleck', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'exception', 'are', 'usually', 'shown', 'private', 'moments', 'animals', 'meet', 'harried', 'hotel', 'manager', 'show', 'fusty', 'manager', 'out-tight', 'kennel', 'club', 'president', 'also', 'meet', 'media', 'personages', 'Buck', 'Laughlin', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'airheaded', 'sex-obsessed', 'TV', 'host', 'Trevor', 'Beckwith', 'Jim', 'Piddock', 'exasperated', 'dog-expert', 'sidekick', 'humor', 'subtle', 'mean', 'never', 'up.The', 'selection', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'hilarious', 'generally', 'played', 'sympathetically', 'occasionally', 'predictable', 'gay', 'couple', 'fussily', 'hotel', 'room', 'replacing', 'pillows', 'tacking', 'up', 'wall', 'coverings', 'yuppie', 'couple', 'neurotically', 'obsessed', 'clothing', 'brands', 'psychiatrists', 'Starbucks', 'laconic', 'Southern', 'gentleman', 'fishing', 'gear', 'store', 'dreams', 'being', 'ventriloquist', 'Funny', 'film', 'often', 'parody', 'bit', 'too', 'close', 'occasionally', 'edge', 'believability', 'One', 'character', 'wife', 'running', 'old', 'boyfriends', 'who', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'graphic', 'reminiscences', 'bit', 'restraint', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'message', 'better', 'Still', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'show', 'material', 'stretched', 'characters', 'even', 'further', 'shape', 'was', 'mercifully', 'left', 'out', 'final', 'product.All', 'Best', 'Show', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'spend', 'Saturday', 'evening', 'Uncharacteristically', 'wife', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'quite', 'often', 'Over-the-top', 'characterizations', 'aside', 'film', 'depictions', 'dog', 'show', 'world', 'are', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'according', 'friend', 'who', 'would', 'know', 'down', 'cast', 'actually', 'championship', 'dogs', 'Comedy', 'aside', 'found', 'dog', 'show', 'world', 'fascinating', 'would', 'love', 'attend', 'event', 'show', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'treatments', 'heavy', 'metal', 'folk', 'music', 'dog', 'shows', 'are', 'always', 'loving', 'homages', 'eccentricities', 'participants', 'celebrations', 'unique', 'contributions', 'culture']",Best in Show

Yet, 'Best in Show' is somewhat different compared to the comedies presented to us here. Directed again by Guest was for a large part improvised according to the film's documentary and is quite different from today's standards. This story is mainly about The Mayflower Kennel Dog Show which is like the Super Bowl of dog shoes; and in documentary style this film showcases the incredibly over-the-top preparations the dog owners take part in for this show.The film constantly cuts from interviews with these zany characters to actual interactive footage shot while on their way to the dog show. All in documentary style that a person who is uneducated about the film can easily mistake for a genuine documentary. This film contains an all-star cast that includes actors who really know how to act and that capture the essence of each scene. This film is lined with scene after scene of hilarious bits focusing upon these characters and the manner in which they handle their canines like minor deities.Guest also takes part as one of the major characters of course and plays Harlan Pepper; a fishing-store owner who travels to the Kennel Dog Show in his Winnebago in hopes of capturing the championship. He is just one of the many developed and layered characters that is fun to watch. Other characters include Parker Posey as a sexually deprived nagging wife who becomes insane with anger after losing her dog's toy. Eugene Levy plays the part of terribly jealous husband born with two left feet to Catherine O'Hara who plays his wife who cannot stop running into men she slept with in the past. Other characters include Michael McKean who plays a homosexual dog owner who steals the movie away from the others when sharing scenes with his male companion during the film's many interview sequences. Fred Willard who takes the art of improvisation to new heights as the dog's shows color commentator is quite funny.As far as breaking new ground is concerned, this film does not.  Aforesaid, it is unconventional and different from others but in the end is a different film with regular results. This film does contain elements that most films do not such as richly textured characters and great acting, but at it's heart cannot break free from the monotonous tone a documentary usually brings with it. Even though it is a mock documentary that does not take itself seriously, it still is a bit over-the-top. Resulting in a different and unconventional film that will best be viewed by fans and new ones--like my self.",4,What does the smell of victory smells like to you -- just don't step in it.,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,2631,"['always', 'thought', 'comedies', 'are', 'usually', 'easiest', 'films', 'write', 'possibly', 'why', 'have', 'so', 'many', ""'Best"", 'Show', 'somewhat', 'different', 'compared', 'comedies', 'presented', 'here', 'Directed', 'again', 'Guest', 'was', 'large', 'part', 'improvised', 'according', 'film', 'documentary', 'quite', 'different', 'today', 'standards', 'story', 'mainly', 'Mayflower', 'Kennel', 'Dog', 'Show', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'dog', 'shoes', 'documentary', 'style', 'film', 'incredibly', 'over-the-top', 'preparations', 'dog', 'owners', 'take', 'part', 'show.The', 'film', 'constantly', 'interviews', 'zany', 'characters', 'actual', 'interactive', 'footage', 'shot', 'way', 'dog', 'show', 'documentary', 'style', 'person', 'who', 'uneducated', 'film', 'can', 'easily', 'mistake', 'genuine', 'documentary', 'film', 'all-star', 'cast', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'know', 'how', 'act', 'capture', 'essence', 'scene', 'film', 'lined', 'scene', 'scene', 'hilarious', 'bits', 'focusing', 'characters', 'manner', 'handle', 'canines', 'minor', 'deities.Guest', 'also', 'part', 'one', 'major', 'characters', 'course', 'Harlan', 'Pepper', 'fishing-store', 'owner', 'who', 'Kennel', 'Dog', 'Show', 'Winnebago', 'hopes', 'capturing', 'championship', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'developed', 'layered', 'characters', 'fun', 'watch', 'Other', 'characters', 'include', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'sexually', 'deprived', 'nagging', 'wife', 'who', 'insane', 'anger', 'losing', 'dog', 'toy', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'part', 'terribly', 'jealous', 'husband', 'born', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'who', 'wife', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'running', 'men', 'slept', 'past', 'Other', 'characters', 'include', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'who', 'homosexual', 'dog', 'owner', 'who', 'movie', 'away', 'others', 'when', 'sharing', 'scenes', 'male', 'companion', 'film', 'many', 'interview', 'sequences', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'who', 'art', 'improvisation', 'new', 'heights', 'dog', 'shows', 'color', 'commentator', 'quite', 'funny.As', 'far', 'breaking', 'new', 'ground', 'concerned', 'film', 'not', 'Aforesaid', 'unconventional', 'different', 'others', 'end', 'different', 'film', 'regular', 'results', 'film', 'contain', 'elements', 'most', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'such', 'richly', 'textured', 'characters', 'great', 'acting', 'heart', 'can', 'not', 'break', 'free', 'monotonous', 'tone', 'documentary', 'usually', 'Even', 'mock', 'documentary', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'still', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'Resulting', 'different', 'unconventional', 'film', 'will', 'best', 'be', 'viewed', 'fans', 'new', 'ones', 'self']",Best in Show

I have a relative who does ridiculous things for their pet and spends a ton of money on it that is not necessary.

With that in mind, I wasn't sure that I would be a big fan of the mockumentary genre.  But, I keep hearing that Best In Show is a great movie.  I finally gave it a shot (as much to see the dogs as it was to see the movie).Best in Show is a mockumentary (a fictional documentary) about a dog show.  We are introduced to the characters as we would in a documentary.  They give interviews talking about who they are, who their dogs are, and about their goals for the dog show (naturally, everyone expects to win).  Everyone is somewhat neurotic.  The movie stars Parker Posey (Party Girl), Eugene Levy (American Pie), Catherine O'Hara (Waiting for Guffman), and Michael McKean (A Mighty Wind).  While Levy and O'Hara seem to get the most time, nobody is really shorted a time to shine.  One of the fun things about this movie is that it is almost completely improvised all the way through, which makes for some very interesting spots and lines.This is a movie of the absurd.  While I didn't find anything to be rolling on the floor funny, I found so much of the movie to be humorous.  The co-announcer at the dog show had some of the best lines as he just asked question after question and while most of his questions/comments would be inappropriate for an actual dog show, this made it all the funnier.  Another highlight for me was Parker Posey.  The movie was filled with interesting characters, each with a different take on the dog show.

In this case, the event is a regional dog show, and the cast of characters are eerily like alot of people we know - our friends and neighbors who actually LOOK like their dogs and drive stationwagons.  You know the kind.We get wrapped up in homey melodramas that evoke laughter, but also a perverse melancholy that allows us to think about &quot;what's really important.&quot;  More so now - post September 11th - than ever, these themes sound hollow and dull, and the movie can seem frivilous at times.  But - give it a chance, and you'll find yourself attracted to this actor or that one - this is ensemble acting at its best (though not better than Guffman.)Guest has an uncanny ability of  bringing out resonant human qualities from his actors and characters.  Instead of feeling sorry for them, we root for our favorites, warts and all.  In the process, we laugh away what's trivial and recognize the depth that can exist in every life. No matter how simple or trivial - life is grand!

577615,ANXYD5XVFVDCW,B00005ALS0,"kaabee ""kabe""","[14, 20]","My wife and I found that we had a night to ourselves so we decided to go see a movie.  I'm not much of a fan of Hollywood these days and when we got to the Mega-Googaplex Cinema 5000 (1000 theaters in one place), it looked like a night of shopping would be more fun.  None of the choice of movies looked good.  But then we saw the marquee for &quot;Best in Show&quot; and saw that Eugene Levy was in it.  I like him so we decided to go in and watch the show.  I'm not a fan of dogs or dog shows and I have known folks in that business. They don't consider it a business - they consider it a &quot;passion&quot; or a &quot;love for the breed&quot; (or any other platitude you wish to insert here).  When the movie started, it was entertaining from beginning to end.  I love the fake documentary type films (such as Zelig, The Last Polka, Take the Money and Run etc.) and this fits perfectly into that genre. What a funny movie.  It's not the fall down laughing type of funny, just the entertaining type of funny.  The characters are classic.  I recognized a lot of types that I have known over the years.  Fred Willard was great as the &quot;play by play&quot; announcer of the dog show, and the cast in this film was perfect.  All did very well.If you have ever watched a real dog show you will see that Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy did an excellent job of research before writing this movie.  They've captured the essence of dog shows in a humorous and entertaining fashion.  They hit the bullseye with this film.  After I watched this movie, I did purchase &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;; a movie poking fun at Community Theater, and found that it was similar in style as Best in Show. It's the same cast of characters.  I guess part of my love for both of those films is that I love watching movies that poke fun at pompous, self-important, egotistical little folks who don't recognize their diminutive stature.  One of the reasons I love Groucho Marx so much was his ability to deflate the biggest ego with a quick witty barb.  And if you have ever known dog show people or community theater sorts, you will really appreciate how sharp the barbs are in these movies.  Neither film is politically correct, which is all the more reason to enjoy them.If you like the fake documentary style of movie, you will love this film.  If you don't like those types of films, then this isn't the film for you.  If you've never seen one of those types of films, but like Eugene Levy then give this one a try.

Written by Spinal Tap creator Christopher Guest and SCTV's Eugene Levy, Best In Show takes a similarly wry yet loving look at the culture of amateur dog shows.As with This Is Spinal Tap, the dog show world is merely a backdrop against which the cast improvises a wild variety of characters: a pair of neurotic yuppies who met in a Starbuck's, a trophy wife and her trainer &quot;friend,&quot; a gay couple comprised of polar opposites - all these people would be funny enough by themselves, but against the surreal seriousness of dog showmanship they are totally hilarious. This is one of those movies where two days later you're boring people at work by repeating lines from the movie.Best In Show really has benefitted from the experience gained during Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman, keeping a real tight comedic pace using editing - in a film where the dialog is mostly improvised, Guest uses cuts to eliminate some of the lags in between stellar comedic bits. It therefore watches as if the whole thing were carefully orchestrated and scripted, not slowing down a bit.I'm tempted to say that some people won't &quot;get&quot; Best In Show, but I really don't see how - it's paced well, it's performed well, the comedy is not mean-spirited or nasty, it's just plain funny, funny, funny.

Bernabo,"[10, 10]","I already knew going in that I like folk music a lot more than dog shows, anniversary pageants, or heavy metal music, which explains why &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; remains my favorite of the Christopher Guest mockumentaries, but &quot;Best in Show&quot; certainly has its moments.  Dog shows are a great target for satirical skewering simply because you do not have to go too far to accomplish the task since the dogs we see posing and prancing are not like the dogs the rest of us know in the real world.  But the dogs are the innocents in this tale, even if they are exposed to the sight of their masters making love.  It is the owners who are invited to humiliate themselves simply by being themselves.The focus point of &quot;Best in Show&quot; is the Mayflower Kennel Club's dog show in the city of Brotherly Love.  The script is by Guest and Eugene Levy, but the idea of a scripted film is a misnomer since what is really at play are the improvisational techniques of Second City more than the crafted skits of Saturday Night Live.  In the grand plan of such mockumentaries we follow the paths of several dogs and their owners, most of whom will indeed be up for the grand prize:Harlan Pepper (Guest) and his bloodhound, Hubert (Ch. Quiet Creek's Stand By Me); Gerry (Levy) and Cookie Fleck (Catharine O'Hara) and their Norwich terrier, Winky (Can. Ch. Urchin's Bryllo); the catalog loving Meg (Parker Posey) and Michael Hitchcock (Hamilton Swan) and their sleek but troubled weimaraner, Beatrice (Can. Ch. Arokat's Echobar Take Me Dancing); Scott Donlon (John Michael Higgins) and Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean), a happy gay couple raising twin Shih Tzus, Miss Agnes (Can. Ch. Raptures Classic) and Tyrone (Can. Ch. Symarun's Red Hot Kisses); and airhead Sherri Ann Ward Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge) married to a geriatric millionaire who has hired the lesbian dominatrix Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) to train a two-time defending champion Rhapsody in White (Brocade Exclamation Ca. Ch. Exxel Dezi Duz It With Pizaz), the Standard Poodle.The actual dog show is pretty much done straight in terms of what we see out on the floor (seeing Don S. Davis as the Best in Show judge was a treat).  The characters might run their dogs around in their own manners, some with more flare than others (i.e., Higgins), but the dogs are trying their best.  The same can be said for genial Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), who is providing commentary on the dog show for the folks watching at home on television.  Buck's comments have as little to do with what is actually going on as possible, while commentator Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock) tries to bear the errant slings and arrows coming out of Buck's mouth as he steals the last half of the movie.The climax of the dog show is one of the subtlest jokes in &quot;Best in Show,&quot; but if you think about America's affection for the underdog in sporting competitions, even those involving actual dogs, you will get the point.  This is perhaps the most subtle of the Guest mockumentaries, which may or may not be saying something.  Whether it becomes a personal favorite is going to depend on your affection for dogs as much as it does on your affection for the usual stable of players that Guest has once again rounded up for the festivities.",4,Some pets deserve a little more respect than others.,1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,3287,"['already', 'knew', 'going', 'like', 'folk', 'music', 'lot', 'more', 'dog', 'shows', 'anniversary', 'pageants', 'heavy', 'metal', 'music', 'why', 'quot', 'A', 'Mighty', 'Wind', 'quot', 'favorite', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'mockumentaries', 'quot', 'Best', 'Show', 'quot', 'certainly', 'moments', 'Dog', 'shows', 'are', 'great', 'target', 'satirical', 'skewering', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'accomplish', 'task', 'dogs', 'see', 'posing', 'prancing', 'are', 'not', 'dogs', 'rest', 'know', 'real', 'world', 'dogs', 'are', 'innocents', 'tale', 'even', 'are', 'exposed', 'sight', 'masters', 'making', 'love', 'owners', 'who', 'are', 'invited', 'humiliate', 'simply', 'being', 'themselves.The', 'focus', 'point', 'quot', 'Best', 'Show', 'quot', 'Mayflower', 'Kennel', 'Club', 'dog', 'show', 'city', 'Brotherly', 'Love', 'script', 'Guest', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'idea', 'scripted', 'film', 'misnomer', 'what', 'really', 'play', 'are', 'improvisational', 'techniques', 'Second', 'City', 'more', 'crafted', 'skits', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'grand', 'plan', 'such', 'mockumentaries', 'follow', 'paths', 'several', 'dogs', 'owners', 'most', 'whom', 'will', 'indeed', 'be', 'up', 'grand', 'prize', 'Harlan', 'Pepper', 'Guest', 'bloodhound', 'Hubert', 'Ch', 'Quiet', 'Creek', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Gerry', 'Levy', 'Cookie', 'Fleck', 'Catharine', ""O'Hara"", 'Norwich', 'terrier', 'Winky', 'Can', 'Ch', 'Urchin', 'Bryllo', 'catalog', 'loving', 'Meg', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Michael', 'Hitchcock', 'Hamilton', 'Swan', 'sleek', 'troubled', 'weimaraner', 'Beatrice', 'Can', 'Ch', 'Arokat', 'Echobar', 'Take', 'Me', 'Dancing', 'Scott', 'Donlon', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'Stefan', 'Vanderhoof', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'happy', 'gay', 'couple', 'raising', 'twin', 'Shih', 'Tzus', 'Miss', 'Agnes', 'Can', 'Ch', 'Raptures', 'Classic', 'Tyrone', 'Can', 'Ch', 'Symarun', 'Red', 'Hot', 'Kisses', 'airhead', 'Sherri', 'Ann', 'Ward', 'Cabot', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'married', 'geriatric', 'millionaire', 'who', 'hired', 'lesbian', 'dominatrix', 'Christy', 'Cummings', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'train', 'two-time', 'defending', 'champion', 'Rhapsody', 'White', 'Brocade', 'Exclamation', 'Ca', 'Ch', 'Exxel', 'Dezi', 'Duz', 'Pizaz', 'Standard', 'Poodle.The', 'actual', 'dog', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'done', 'straight', 'terms', 'what', 'see', 'out', 'floor', 'seeing', 'Don', 'S.', 'Davis', 'Best', 'Show', 'judge', 'was', 'treat', 'characters', 'might', 'run', 'dogs', 'own', 'manners', 'more', 'flare', 'others', 'i.e.', 'Higgins', 'dogs', 'are', 'trying', 'best', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'genial', 'Buck', 'Laughlin', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'who', 'providing', 'commentary', 'dog', 'show', 'folks', 'watching', 'home', 'television', 'Buck', 'comments', 'have', 'as', 'little', 'do', 'what', 'actually', 'going', 'possible', 'commentator', 'Trevor', 'Beckwith', 'Jim', 'Piddock', 'bear', 'errant', 'slings', 'arrows', 'coming', 'Buck', 'mouth', 'last', 'half', 'movie.The', 'climax', 'dog', 'show', 'one', 'subtlest', 'jokes', 'quot', 'Best', 'Show', 'quot', 'think', 'America', 'affection', 'underdog', 'sporting', 'competitions', 'even', 'involving', 'actual', 'dogs', 'will', 'get', 'point', 'perhaps', 'most', 'subtle', 'Guest', 'mockumentaries', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'saying', 'something', 'personal', 'favorite', 'going', 'depend', 'affection', 'dogs', 'as', 'much', 'affection', 'usual', 'stable', 'players', 'Guest', 'once', 'again', 'rounded', 'up', 'festivities']",Best in Show

577658,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005ALS0,Matthew Horner,"[0, 1]","Best in Show is a clever 'mocumentary', a delightful satire of the dog show world. Director Christopher Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy also star in the movie, along with a slew of other comic actors. As writers, Guest and Levy are throwbacks to kinder, gentler times. Their brand of satire is funny and sometimes biting, but it is never brutal. They allow the performers to improvise a lot. This doesn't always work out, but when it does, the results are hysterical. The movie succeeds because the dogs' owners, not the dogs themselves, are the real characters. It shows that in the bond between man and dog, man may be the strangest and funniest half.At the start, we meet several couples and individuals who will be showing their dogs in the Mayflower competition in Philadelphia. Some are shown in real scenes, other in fake interviews. Christopher Guest is Harlan Pepper, a down home North Carolina boy who runs a fishing supply store. He also raises champion blood hounds and dreams of being a ventriloquist. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara play the Flecks. He literally has two left feet, and she is an aging hot babe, who is constantly running into men from her past, much to Mr. Fleck's annoyance. Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are the Swans, a couple of yuppie lawyers who have channeled way too much emotion into their dog. Sherri Ann [Jennifer Coolidge] is a very buxom and very wealthy matron who, along with her trainer, Christie [Jane Lynch], has entered her pom-pommed poodle. Finally, we met Scott and Stephan [John Michael Higgins and Michael McKeen], a gay couple who has entered one of their beloved toy dogs. In their spare time, Scott and Stephan produce calendars, using photos of their dogs dressed up like characters in famous movies.The movie follows the characters before, during and after the competition. The show itself is quite authentic looking. It even spoofs sports announcing. One of the announcers is a proper Englishman, full of knowledge about dog shows. The other is an American who is completely clueless. Their scenes are among the film's funniest.The humor is Best in Show is too dry for some viewers. It's often subtle comedy. I enjoyed it, but I like my humor from broad to dry and everything in-between. I also think I share Guest and Levy's point of view. They seem to be dog lovers who think that what goes on in the world of championship dog lovers is somewhat over the top. What the characters in the movie express towards dogs isn't exactly love. It's more obsession and a need to be noticed. In fact, these people require more attention than their mutts do.",4,I Give This Four Barks Out of Five,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,2614,"['Best', 'Show', 'clever', ""'mocumentary"", 'delightful', 'satire', 'dog', 'show', 'world', 'Director', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'co-writer', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'also', 'movie', 'slew', 'other', 'comic', 'actors', 'writers', 'Guest', 'Levy', 'are', 'throwbacks', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'times', 'brand', 'satire', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'biting', 'never', 'brutal', 'allow', 'performers', 'improvise', 'lot', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'out', 'when', 'results', 'are', 'hysterical', 'movie', 'dogs', 'owners', 'not', 'dogs', 'are', 'real', 'characters', 'bond', 'man', 'dog', 'man', 'may', 'be', 'strangest', 'funniest', 'half.At', 'start', 'meet', 'several', 'couples', 'individuals', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'showing', 'dogs', 'Mayflower', 'competition', 'Philadelphia', 'are', 'shown', 'real', 'scenes', 'other', 'fake', 'interviews', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'Harlan', 'Pepper', 'down', 'home', 'North', 'Carolina', 'boy', 'who', 'fishing', 'supply', 'store', 'also', 'champion', 'blood', 'hounds', 'dreams', 'being', 'ventriloquist', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'play', 'Flecks', 'literally', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'aging', 'hot', 'babe', 'who', 'constantly', 'running', 'men', 'past', 'much', 'Mr.', 'Fleck', 'annoyance', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Michael', 'Hitchcock', 'are', 'Swans', 'couple', 'yuppie', 'lawyers', 'who', 'have', 'channeled', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'emotion', 'dog', 'Sherri', 'Ann', '[', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', ']', 'very', 'buxom', 'very', 'wealthy', 'matron', 'who', 'trainer', 'Christie', '[', 'Jane', 'Lynch', ']', 'entered', 'pom-pommed', 'poodle', 'Finally', 'met', 'Scott', 'Stephan', '[', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'Michael', 'McKeen', ']', 'gay', 'couple', 'who', 'entered', 'one', 'beloved', 'toy', 'dogs', 'spare', 'time', 'Scott', 'Stephan', 'produce', 'calendars', 'using', 'photos', 'dogs', 'dressed', 'up', 'characters', 'famous', 'movies.The', 'movie', 'characters', 'competition', 'show', 'quite', 'authentic', 'looking', 'even', 'spoofs', 'sports', 'announcing', 'One', 'announcers', 'proper', 'Englishman', 'full', 'knowledge', 'dog', 'shows', 'other', 'American', 'who', 'completely', 'clueless', 'scenes', 'are', 'film', 'funniest.The', 'humor', 'Best', 'Show', 'too', 'dry', 'viewers', 'often', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'enjoyed', 'like', 'humor', 'broad', 'dry', 'everything', 'in-between', 'also', 'think', 'share', 'Guest', 'Levy', 'point', 'view', 'seem', 'be', 'dog', 'lovers', 'who', 'think', 'what', 'world', 'championship', 'dog', 'lovers', 'somewhat', 'top', 'What', 'characters', 'movie', 'express', 'towards', 'dogs', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'love', 'more', 'obsession', 'need', 'be', 'noticed', 'fact', 'people', 'require', 'more', 'attention', 'mutts', 'do']",Best in Show

So obsessed that they would take their pets and put them in a type of &quot;beauty pageant&quot; in order to get awards and recognition.  It's funny and unrelenting because you see it as an everyday occurrence in society.  People like this really do exist, and that is why it's so humorous.  The characters are all out of their minds and are a joy to watch in this very entertaining and unpredictable film.I had no idea what I was going to experience when I popped this into the DVD player.  At first, it didn't seem like anything that would interest me.  However, almost every single person I know had seen it and encouraged me to watch it.  I'm glad I did give it a chance, because I ended up really liking it.  The satire is outrageous and subtle at the same time (something that's VERY difficult to accomplish unless the project is in the right hands).  The actors are hilarious and very animated, but at the same time you know that these types of people really do exist!  Eugene Levy was my favorite person in the film.  He's so subtle and clever when it comes to humor.  Overall, everybody was fantastic in their roles.The DVD has some really cool extras.  It has very good picture and sound quality.

Highly competitive people seem attracted to endeavors that encourage it.  That's why this mock documentary is so funny--dog owners and dog trainers spending time, money and angst in search of that big win in that big show where the ""Best in Show"" win becomes national news.This is character driven comedy that shows a variety of people caught up in the drama of the ""Mayflower Dog Show"" a stand-in for the Westminster Kennel Club dog show.  Nearly all of the characters depicted in this movie are endearing goofballs who love their dogs. The one exception is the yuppie couple that everyone will love to hate.  Not only are they neurotic and obnoxious but they project those traits on to their dogs...The dogs are real champions and tremendous good sports although their body language frequently reveals that they are interacting with actors and not their real ""people"".  The movie follows the rule that the owners somehow ""match"" the type of dog, so the bloodhound man gives folksy nutty monologues, the gay couple with the Shih-Tzus redecorate their hotel room just for the night and the modest brown Norwich terrier is carried around by a woman who wears LOUD printed blouses that are down to THERE.The know-nothing TV commentator is also amusing.  He's been doing it for years and never learned a thing, one gathers.Maybe this is not laugh-out-loud comedy, but it is becoming almost an annual favorite, trotted out every year or so whenever Westminster is in the news.

577674,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005ALS0,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[2, 3]","Best in Show is what could only be described as an affectionate mockumentary of the world of dog shows and their occasionally over-obsessed, over-ambitious, neurotic and downright barking mad owners. Co-written, directed and starring Christopher Guest, best known as Nigel Tufnell in `This Is Spinal Tap', this could very much be considered the canine equivalent of Rob Reiner's acclaimed cult movie, for instead of a rock band behaving badly, instead we have some rather over-obsessed dog owner's behaving madly. If you will excuse the obvious pun, this is not so much Spinal Tap, as This is Spaniel Yap.One of the great things about `Best In Show' is that it is played as a straight documentary, and we never get any glimpses of the supposed documentary makers filming the would be champions proud owners and there are no nudges and winks to the camera. Very much as real documentaries do, `Best In Show' follows five different couples from vastly different social backgrounds but all childless, with the exception of the four legged friends, as they seek tp win the title of top dog at the annual Mayflower dog show. It is very much fly on the wall and even though all the characters might be characterised as stereotypical, there is actually very little caricature, which is what makes it immensely funny and if you didn't know better, you might even believe it was real. There are no [] jokes that revolve around dog [mess] and most importantly of all `Best In Show' is consistently funny all the way through.There is so much to enjoy about this movie. Christopher Guest subtly directs it and it has a sharp and acutely well-observed script. It very much affectionately mocks the owner's whilst never seeking to either mock man's best friend or the world of dog shows. In fact I would say that to really enjoy this movie it helps to be a dog lover, you even find yourself laughing because in certain parts you recognise that some of the behaviour exhibited by the neurotic owners is not so different to ourselves with our own furry friends.The cast of this movie includes no big stars but many familiar faces. For example Eugene Levy, the movie's co-author, who is previously best known for his role as the emabressing Dad in the American Pie movies appears as the literally two left-footed owner of a Norwich Terrier. His wife is played by Catherine O'Hara (Home Alone, Dick Tracy), who has a somewhat colourful past that seems to include a string of lovers in every bar in every town, much to Gerry's embaressment. There is also a [] couple played by Michael McKean, another Spinal Tap alumnus and John Michael Higgins (Ally MacBeal) who show shih-tzus and in the case of the latter, camp it up outrageously. Parker Posey (Scream 3) and Michael Hitchcock (Happy, Texas) play neurotic yuppie lawyers and parents to a Weimaraner apparently traumatised after seeing them perform `the congress of the cow' from the karma sutra. Director Christopher Guest (Waiting For Guffman) plays a redneck bloodhound owner who can name every type of nut but tackiest of all is the gold-digging Sherri married to a senile millionaire about to shuffle off this mortal coil played by Jennifer Coolidge (Legally Blonde), who is on the brink of a lesbian affair with the trainer of her beloved standard poodle. Ed Begley jnr even puts in a cameo appearance as a hotel manager. All the actors perform there parts with great subtlety and it is to their credit that many of the lines were apparently improvised.If `Best In Show' is for the most part a movie that keeps you quietly chuckling, it is also a film that will have you laughing out loud when the contestants finally reach the main event (The Mayflower Dog Show), as commentary for the show is provided in a sports cast style by Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard) who openly flaunts his ignorance of all things canine to comical effect and we are also treated to the sight of Gerry, two left feet `n all parading his Norwich Terrier around the show ring.

Don't get me wrong; if you get the humor you WILL laugh out loud.

When you consider that the majority of the film is improvisational, with the characters given a basic structure from which to work and then allowed to &quot;go where their creativity takes them&quot; you get a real appreciation of just what a good ensemble cast can capture/create.This particular outing takes on the world of dog shows and follows the exploits of various dog owners to the Best In Show finals.  It is a stitch!  There is something here for everybody.  Of course the standout is Fred Willard as an obnoxious commentator who really deserved winning the Oscar for supporting actor for which he was nominated.  The character study of each dog owner of course sheds infinite light into why they are so obsessed with their dog receiving the top award.The improvisation is top-notch but I would expect nothing less.  Catherine O'Hara is generally flawless and here she does not disappoint.  She is in RARE form!  She and Eugene Levy play off each other quite well.

Crew catalog like it is a work of great literature and constantly bicker with each other about their dog's mental health and the subtle differences the colors putty and ecru.Rhapsody in White, the highly coiffed Standard Poodle is owned by a 90 year old kajillionaire's trophy wife (Jennifer Coolidge) who is having an affair with Christy Cummings, the dog's severe lesbian trainer (Jane Lynch).Winky, a spunky Norwich Terrier is adored by a former party girl (Catherine O'Hara) and her nerdy, two left footed husband (Eugene Levy) who at every turn is forced to confront his wife's promiscuous past and her sloppy bookkeeping skills.Miss Agnes, the fluffy white Shih Tzu is the prized pooch of two gay men, played brilliantly by Michael McKean and his campy live-in boyfriend (John Michael Higgins).Hubert, the sad-eyed Bloodhound is shown by a single country boy, played by Christopher Guest, who created the series of mock documentary films that BEST IN SHOW is one part of.There are far too many hilarious scenes in BEST IN SHOW to recount.  Particularly great ones include the scene when Winky's owner and her husband check into their hotel and are offered a room in the storage closet by a stiff inn keeper who you may or may not recognize as Ed Begley, Jr.Another great scene is when a very inappropriate color commentator (Fred Willard) reels off one bizarre observation after another about the dog's trainers, the judges and the clothing of its owners.But perhaps my favorite scene is when Winky's owners visit an old friend who works as a hostage negotiator and announces almost demonically that when people are on top of a building and threaten to leap to their deaths, ""they all jump.""BEST IN SHOW is a highly recommended DVD from the same mock documentary genre of This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman.

577696,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005ALS0,Reviewer,"[7, 8]","Writer/director Christopher Guest takes a look at the relationship between Man and that most loyal of beasts, the dog, in ""Best In Show,"" a humorous satire presented in the same ""mock documentary"" style as Rob Reiner's ""This Is Spinal Tap.""  It's a keen observation of human nature, as it is much more about the owners and handlers than about the dogs themselves, and much as David Byrne did with ""True Stories,"" Guest presents a diverse community united by a single, common thread, that being their love for their dogs, and aspirations of winning the blue ribbon in the upcoming competition that will go to the top dog overall, the Best In Show.  Through a series of interviews and memorable scenes, we are introduced to the owners and their beloved canines who will soon square off in the arena at the world class Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia.  We get to know a bit about each of the participants, so we know just who they are and where they come from.  Guest has assembled a terrific ensemble cast, who bring it all to life by creating a rich tapestry of characters culled from a true cross section of Americana:  Good ol' boy Harlan Pepper (Guest), with his Bloodhound, ""Hubert"", from Pine Nut, North Carolina; a somewhat neurotic young couple from Illinois, Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock), members of the ""Starbucks"" set with their Weimaraner, ""Beatrice;"" Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara), a couple who could be anybody's next door neighbors, with their Norwich Terrier, ""Winky"", from Fern City, Florida;  Leslie and Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw and Jennifer Coolidge) a wealthy couple who have a Standard Poodle, ""Rhapsody In White"", entrusted to the care of professional handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch); and finally, another couple, Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof (John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean), with their precious Shih Tzus, ""Miss Agnes.""  This is a highly entertaining, funny movie, filled with wry, subtle humor that is delivered straight and never played for laughs, which makes it believable and real, and all the more hilarious.  This is quite a group of characters, eclectic to say the least, and they're all real people.  You're bound to run into someone you know among them.  The dialogue is sharp, and rife with dry wit.  And for anyone who's ever watched any kind of sporting event on television, you'll appreciate the parody of the so-called ""color commentator,"" in this case a guy named Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), that is dead on the money.  His comments during an interview to a nonplused Dr. Millbank (Bob Balaban) about Columbus landing at Plymouth Rock will have you on the floor.  There is so much here you can relate to, and it's all done in such good fun.  Rounding out the outstanding supporting cast are Don Lake (Graham Chissolm), Jim Piddock (Trevor Beckwith), Ed Begley, Jr. (Hotel manager), Linda Kash (Fay Berman), Larry Miller (Max Berman) and Don S. Davis (Best In Show Judge).  The performances here are good all around, with especially notable turns by O'Hara, Levy, Guest, Lynch and Willard.  Written by Guest and Levy, ""Best In Show"" works so well because it holds up a mirror and reflects the lives we all lead in one way or another.  As we watch, we realize that even as we are laughing at all of these characters and situations, at the same time we're laughing at ourselves as well; because there's more than a little bit of each one of us in there somewhere.  And it reminds us that when things seem to be getting too serious, it's time to pick up that mirror and take a good look; and thanks to the frame of reference that a movie like this provides, you just may find something to laugh about, and be able to discover the ""Best In Show"" in your own life.",4,Who Let The Dogs Out?,972345600,"10 24, 2000",2000,3794,"['Writer/director', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'look', 'relationship', 'Man', 'most', 'loyal', 'beasts', 'dog', 'Best', 'Show', 'humorous', 'satire', 'presented', 'same', 'mock', 'documentary', 'style', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'keen', 'observation', 'human', 'nature', 'much', 'more', 'owners', 'handlers', 'dogs', 'much', 'David', 'Byrne', 'did', 'True', 'Stories', 'Guest', 'diverse', 'community', 'united', 'single', 'common', 'thread', 'being', 'love', 'dogs', 'aspirations', 'winning', 'blue', 'ribbon', 'upcoming', 'competition', 'will', 'go', 'top', 'dog', 'overall', 'Best', 'Show', 'series', 'interviews', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'are', 'introduced', 'owners', 'beloved', 'canines', 'who', 'will', 'soon', 'square', 'off', 'arena', 'world', 'class', 'Mayflower', 'Dog', 'Show', 'Philadelphia', 'get', 'know', 'bit', 'participants', 'know', 'just', 'who', 'are', 'where', 'come', 'Guest', 'assembled', 'terrific', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'who', 'bring', 'life', 'creating', 'rich', 'tapestry', 'characters', 'culled', 'true', 'cross', 'section', 'Americana', 'Good', 'ol', 'boy', 'Harlan', 'Pepper', 'Guest', 'Bloodhound', 'Hubert', 'Pine', 'Nut', 'North', 'Carolina', 'somewhat', 'neurotic', 'young', 'couple', 'Illinois', 'Meg', 'Hamilton', 'Swan', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Michael', 'Hitchcock', 'members', 'Starbucks', 'set', 'Weimaraner', 'Beatrice', 'Gerry', 'Cookie', 'Fleck', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'couple', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'anybody', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'Norwich', 'Terrier', 'Winky', 'Fern', 'City', 'Florida', 'Leslie', 'Sheri', 'Ann', 'Ward', 'Cabot', 'Patrick', 'Cranshaw', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'wealthy', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'Standard', 'Poodle', 'Rhapsody', 'White', 'entrusted', 'care', 'professional', 'handler', 'Christy', 'Cummings', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'finally', 'couple', 'Scott', 'Donlan', 'Stefan', 'Vanderhoof', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'precious', 'Shih', 'Tzus', 'Miss', 'Agnes', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'movie', 'filled', 'wry', 'subtle', 'humor', 'delivered', 'straight', 'never', 'played', 'laughs', 'believable', 'real', 'more', 'hilarious', 'quite', 'group', 'characters', 'eclectic', 'say', 'least', ""'re"", 'real', 'people', ""'re"", 'bound', 'run', 'someone', 'know', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'rife', 'dry', 'wit', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'watched', 'kind', 'sporting', 'event', 'television', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'parody', 'so-called', 'color', 'commentator', 'case', 'guy', 'named', 'Buck', 'Laughlin', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'dead', 'money', 'comments', 'interview', 'nonplused', 'Dr.', 'Millbank', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Columbus', 'landing', 'Plymouth', 'Rock', 'will', 'have', 'floor', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'can', 'relate', 'done', 'such', 'good', 'fun', 'Rounding', 'out', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'Don', 'Lake', 'Graham', 'Chissolm', 'Jim', 'Piddock', 'Trevor', 'Beckwith', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'Hotel', 'manager', 'Linda', 'Kash', 'Fay', 'Berman', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'Max', 'Berman', 'Don', 'S.', 'Davis', 'Best', 'Show', 'Judge', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'good', 'especially', 'notable', 'turns', ""O'Hara"", 'Levy', 'Guest', 'Lynch', 'Willard', 'Written', 'Guest', 'Levy', 'Best', 'Show', 'so', 'well', 'up', 'mirror', 'lives', 'lead', 'one', 'way', 'watch', 'realize', 'that', 'even', 'are', 'laughing', 'characters', 'situations', 'same', 'time', ""'re"", 'laughing', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'one', 'somewhere', 'when', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'too', 'serious', 'time', 'pick', 'up', 'mirror', 'take', 'good', 'look', 'thanks', 'frame', 'reference', 'movie', 'just', 'may', 'find', 'something', 'laugh', 'be', 'able', 'discover', 'Best', 'Show', 'own', 'life']",Best in Show

577703,A30JWBSVCFYXPE,B00005ALS0,"Robert Knetsch ""Wanna-be theologian""","[3, 5]","Eugene Levy and Christopher Guest have pulled off another great ""mockumentary"" surrounding the owners of show-dogs as they compete in what appears to be the superbowl of Dog Shows.Following a series off characters, all of whom are odd in some way, makes for great entertainment.  The low-budget nature of the film adds to its realistic hilarity, though at times the humour is a bit over-the-top.  I found myself laughing frequently at this film, enjoying the strange and eccentric people that continually parade across the screen - and that doesn't even take into account the dogs!  Which reminds me - if you love dogs, as I do, then you will enjoy the many and varied canines that are on display here.I particularly commend Levy as an awkward, sensitive man with two left feet - literally.  His constant demeanor of confusion and caring is hilarious and highlights Levy's comedic abilities that have made me laugh for 15 years since SCTV reruns where on TV.I was also surprised and delighted by Fred Willard's absolutely hilarious role as the half-witted, over-talkative and misinformed announcer for the dog show.  His antics were brilliantly pulled off and were the source of a great deal of my laughter.This movie in style, comedy and even characters is little different from Waiting for Guffman (I have not seen This is Spinal Tap), so if you did not like Guffman's brand of humour, you will want to avoid this.Otherwise, sit back and enjoy!",4,"If you like Waiting for Guffman, you'll love this!",976752000,"12 14, 2000",2000,1446,"['Eugene', 'Levy', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'great', 'mockumentary', 'surrounding', 'owners', 'show-dogs', 'compete', 'what', 'be', 'superbowl', 'Dog', 'Shows.Following', 'series', 'characters', 'whom', 'are', 'odd', 'way', 'great', 'entertainment', 'low-budget', 'nature', 'film', 'realistic', 'hilarity', 'though', 'times', 'humour', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'found', 'laughing', 'frequently', 'film', 'enjoying', 'strange', 'eccentric', 'people', 'continually', 'parade', 'screen', ""n't"", 'even', 'take', 'account', 'dogs', 'Which', 'love', 'dogs', 'do', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'many', 'varied', 'canines', 'are', 'display', 'here.I', 'particularly', 'commend', 'Levy', 'awkward', 'sensitive', 'man', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'literally', 'constant', 'demeanor', 'confusion', 'caring', 'hilarious', 'highlights', 'Levy', 'comedic', 'abilities', 'have', 'made', '15', 'years', 'SCTV', 'where', 'TV.I', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'delighted', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'role', 'half-witted', 'over-talkative', 'misinformed', 'announcer', 'dog', 'show', 'antics', 'were', 'brilliantly', 'pulled', 'off', 'were', 'source', 'great', 'deal', 'laughter.This', 'movie', 'style', 'comedy', 'even', 'characters', 'little', 'different', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'Guffman', 'brand', 'humour', 'will', 'want', 'avoid', 'this.Otherwise', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy']",Best in Show
577704,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005ALS0,Robert Morris,"[5, 6]","Director and co-screenwriter Guest has been centrally involved with the creation of four of the best ""mockumentaries"": This Is Spinal Tap (1983), Waiting for Guffman (1996), Best in Show (2000), and A Mighty Wind (2003). The effectiveness of a mockumentary depends on several factors. First, the actors must ""play it straight,"" as if unaware that they are spoofing anyone or anything. Fred Willard (Buck Laughlin), for example, in this film or Leslie Nielsen in Airplane! or as Frank Drebin in the Naked Gun series. Also, the material presented must be THAT close to the original as is indeed true of the music performed in A Mighty Wind. Finally, the objects of ridicule must in some way deserve it (e.g. Bob Balaban as Dr. Theodore W. Milbank III) but the humor must never be mean-spirited. Note Guest's treatment of the fact that Gerry Fleck (played with the straightest of faces by Eugene Levy) has -- literally -- two left feet.In this film, Guest uses a familiar but effective strategy for the basis of his narrative: Select several individuals and follow their separate journeys to the same destination, in this case a dog show in Philadelphia. Harlan Pepper (Guest) and the Flecks (Levy and Catherine O'Hara) are among among those who have registered their dogs for competition in the annual and prestigious Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show in Philadelphia. Shrewdly, Guest and Levy have co-written a screenplay in which there is a wide and rich variety of people involved. One of the most conspicuous is Sherri Ann Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge), a statuesque and voluptuous bi-sexual, who attends the show with her ancient husband (Patrick Cranshaw), hoping that her poodle ""Rhapsody in White"" can win again. Sherri Ann is also accompanied by Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch), the dog's trainer/handler and Sherri Ann's lover. Meg and Michael Swan (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock) are also there with Beatrice, a Weimaraner who is almost (not quite) as neurotic as they are. Still another interesting couple consists of Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins) and his life partner Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean) who have entered their Shih Tzu ""Miss Agnes"" in the competition and expect her to win.Many years ago, I first saw Fred Willard (with Martin Mull) on the television series Fernwood 2-Night. He recreates essentially the same role (pseudo-sophisticate dimwit) in this film as Buck Laughlin. He and Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock) provide commentary throughout the competition. Insofar as Beckwith is concerned, the chemistry between them could not be much worse. However, as a mockumentary requires, Laughlin is oblivious to that...and to just about everything else as he prattles and chortles along. Willard's is a stunning performance. What a treat it would be to eavesdrop on a conversation between Willard's Laughlin and Nielsen's Drebin.This is film loses nothing even after being seen several times. In fact, I see something ""new"" each time I see it again. (For me, the same is also true of Young Frankenstein and The Birdcage.) Some of the scenes and some of the characters become even more hilarious. For example, when Scott and Stefan register at the hotel and then begin to redecorate their room, when the Flecks visit one of Cookie's many former boyfriends and his family, and what happens after the Flecks' Norwich terrier ""Winky"" reaches the final round of competition. Guest cleverly concludes his film by answering the question ""Whatever happened to....?"" thereby providing an update on each of couples as well as of Harlan long after the competition.

This film has a great ensemble cast, all with different styles. The format switches between stories of all the contestants preparing for and then participating in the dog show, intermingled with sports-announcing commentary. For me Fred Willard's performance giving that commentary, clearly mostly improv, was the highlight of the film. To be honest, after buying this on Amazon I got email notice that I could watch it as a free download and I did that - so I have not yet opened the disc.

577707,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B00005ALS0,Robin Simmons,"[21, 24]","Sly humor in another vein is finely tuned in Christopher (&quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;) Guest's &quot;BEST IN SHOW.&quot; Writer-director Guest and his fearless ensemble players zero in on the animals and humans who dwell in the strange subculture of competitive dog shows. Almost documentary -- or should I say &quot;dogumentary&quot;? -- in style, this largely improvised, sustained farce follows a clique of dog owners as they enter their animals in a national competition. You may not laugh out loud, but you will certainly smile and possibly even chortle at the eccentric dog owners. There's Parker Posey and Mike Hitchcock, a tightly-wound, pretentious yuppie couple who think they've traumatized their Weimeraner when they had sex in front of him.  Co-writer Eugene Levy is a Terrier owner and amazingly tolerant husband to Catherine O'Hara and her prodigious sleep-around past.  Guest is a loquacious, ventriloquist-aspiring and literally red-necked owner of a sardonically-faced Bloodhound.  Fred Willard steals the show as a naive -- and painfully inappropriate -- ad-libbing announcer.

577709,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005ALS0,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 5]","***1/2  Comedies come in many different shapes and forms.  Some, like Eddie Murphy vehicles, feature a main character who is demonstrably more intelligent than any once else around him, so we, in the audience, get to feel superior right along with him.  We actually derive comic pleasure out of flaunting that superiority.  Another type of comedy is one in which the audience is made to feel superior to EVERYONE on screen.  This is the category into which Christopher Guest's clever and zany mockumentaries, ""Waiting for Guffman"" and now ""Best of Show,"" belong.So how does Guest manage to pull off this delicate high wire act of making us feel better than the characters on screen yet not having the movie slide over into cruelty and sadism?  Quite simply, he makes us see ourselves in the characters at the very same time we are laughing at them.  As a shrewd observer of human nature, Guest casts a scathing, yet at the same time utterly affectionate, eye on the bizarre rituals of small town Middle America.  In the case of ""Best in Show,"" Guest opens up to us the strange milieu of dog show competitions and the people involved in them.  As in ""Waiting For Guffman,"" he has assembled a cast of lovably eccentric characters to both act out the little dramas of their lives and address the audience directly in the form of mock interviews.  There is no point in reiterating the specifics of the many colorful characters whose lives we follow in the course of the film.  Those you can check out for yourself.  Suffice it to say that Guest makes us see many of our own obsessions, peculiarities and insecurities reflected in these people.  True, competitive dog shows may not be our own particular cup of tea, but we all fixate on SOMETHING that the rest of the world seems ignorantly unwilling to understand, something we may hide from our fellow men simply because they will not ""get it.""  ""Best in Show"" lets us laugh at ourselves without our having to reveal our own personal sore spot.The large and superb cast is called upon to hit just the right comic note, ranging from subtle pathos to over-the-top absurdity - and it is a challenge the actors meet with flying colors.  Perhaps to demonstrate his egalitarian spirit, Guest gives some of his funniest bits to Fred Willard as a show announcer who has not a clue as to the finer points of the competition.  As the one person not initiated into the mysteries of the proceedings, Willard's character seems more out of touch than the eccentrics who get it all.On the laugh meter, ""Best of Show"" doesn't rate quite as high as ""Waiting For Guffman.""  But for its moments of homespun cleverness and charm, it is definitely a comedy well worth checking out for yourself.

Buy this movie if you loved Chris Kattan in The House on Haunted Hill. Buy this movie if you loved Rhys Ifans in....... anything. Because, if you love scene stealers, then this is the perfect comedy for you. Every single piece of precious celluloid is absolutely caked in scene stealing performances that most directors throw in as a way to cover up imperfections in plot, acting etc. But Christopher Guest (director/writer) has based his entire movie around these types of performences. This very underrated comedy is packed to the brim with both proven and virgin improv' geniuses. Think Christopher Guest (The Princess Bride, This is Spinal Tap), Eugene Levy (American Pie 1 &amp; 2, Cannonball Run), Jennifer Cooliage (M.I.L.F from American Pie), Parker Posey (Scream 3), Fred Willard (Waiting for Guffman), Michael McKean, (This is Spinal Tap, Airheads), and the brilliant John Michael Higgins whom I've never seen before now, but has certainly made a lasting impression on me.So, what's the plot? Quite simply-- a dog show and all the wonderfully quirky characters that come with it. That's it. Blood isn't spilt. Guns aren't fired. Cars don't chase. Nothing slightly rivetting happens. The characters travel to the dog show and compete. Nothing more. But rest assured you will be rivetted, waiting impatiently for the next histerical classic moment to jump out at you. And trust me, there isn't much of a wait. In fact there isn't a dull moment in this gem from beginning to end. And don't think for a second that the laughs end with the closing credits for owners of the DVD are in for a treat with deleted scenes aplenty. I just loved every single one of Christopher Guest's scenes, one of which has his character introducing us to his beach ball collection. Hundreds of inflated beach balls crammed into his barn. This scene rates right up there with those scenes left in the movie. So if you love comedies; Watch it. If you loved it; own it.

It's hard to explain why a cult classic like ""This Is Spinal Tap"" can underwhelm some of us while the Guest send-ups (of the dog show world, of aspiring Hollywood stars, of community theater enthusiasts, of the folk-singing culture of the '60s) are so addictive.  Part of it is the repertory company that consistently appears (Guest, Levy, Willard, O'Hara, etc.).  The first film becomes better with each succeeding film as you marvel at the adaptability of the characters (I didn't even recognize Guest in ""Waiting for Guffman"").  The observation of human nature is as sharp as the eye of a Jaques Tati but never prone to misfires, dull stretches, pointless routines--because the films are organized around a driving compulsion that simply must be seen from inception to conclusion.  The characters are ""types"" but not so over-the-top as to lose their recognizability. And remarkably, I have yet to see a character who, regardless of his or her ticks and obsessions, is unlikable.  Don't expect to be rolling in the aisles (or falling out of bed) but don't be surprised if an occasional howler isn't forceful enough to wake up a nearby companion (they should have been watching, anyway).Relating the specifics of the plot. characterizations and comedy would be an exercise in futility (what's funny let alone believable about a schlep with 2 left feet?).  But in our hyper, over-glitzy, over-computerized and overly-produced, ""virtual"" worlds that pass for entertainment--from Spieberg over-achieving epic ""events"" to more Robin Williams' feel-good formulae to contrived Ben Stiller family commodities to some of the grosser whoopee cushion films that try to appeal to alternative tastes in low humor--the Guest films emerge as a sort of last frontier for creative, childlike adult minds to approach the making of movies with enthusiasm and gusto, not to mention the old-fashioned-way.

Guest is responsible, or partly responsible, for &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (co-written by Guest) and &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; (co-written and directed by Guest), two films that have set lofty standards that all 'mockumentaries' strive for.  Alas, Guest does not achieve a perfect 3 for 3 as his latest film does not reach the rarefied heights attained by his previous projects.  However, this is a close miss and Guest should still be applauded for being consistently funny.  What made the previous films better was that Guest took perfectly realistic and believable situations and characters and gave them a slight comic twist.  Yes, we laughed at the people in those films but we also recognized in them a little of ourselves or of other actual people we know.  This time around, Guest seems to have shed his subtlety and decided to go over-the-top with the comedy.  This is especially evident in his characterizations of the yuppie couple and the gay couple.  Fred Willard, despite being gut-bustingly hilarious as the clueless sportscaster, has lines that are not even halfway believable.  And when the characters were subtle, such as Guest's Harlan Pepper, they run into the problem of not being funny.  Compare Harlan Pepper to Waiting For Guffman's equivalent -- Parker Posey's Libby Mae Brown -- and it's clear that Guest fell short this time around.  &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; and &quot;Waiting For Guffman&quot; were able to maintain, albeit precariously, the belief that these characters could be real, that we could run into them if we were heavy metal concert promoters or hick-town pageant directors.

It's bascially a mockumentary about a national dog show, the dog owners and their dogs. I guess it could have been ok, but it was very un-interesting. After about 30 minutes I gave up on it. If I would have had absolutely nothing better to do, and was bored out of my mind, I probably would have watched it. It wasn't a bad movie, and I wouldn't say it was boring, it was just un-interesting. It was cool to see christopher guest playing a southern backwoods sort of character who raised a bloodhound. Keep in mind, This Is Spinal Tap is my favorite movie. I have seen it dozens of times. I thought about it, and one thing about Spinal Tap that made it better, was that in between the interviews, there was actual concert footage of them playing, which was cool. Obviously, people not interested in rock music would probably not care for it. I love dogs, and I even watch the national kennel club dog shows on tv each year.

Maybe this will change with his new opus, &quot;Best in Show.&quot;This time out we learn about the &quot;special&quot; relationships people can have with their dogs as we follow a broad range of deluded people on their way to their personal Superbowl, the Mayflower Dog Show.From Pine Nut, North Carolina we meet Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest) and his Bloodhound, Hubert. Harlan knows a lot about fly-fishing and nuts, but perhaps not as much about ventriloquism as he'd like.Yuppie lawyers Meg (Parker Posey) and Hamilton Swan (Michl Hitchcock) are drowning in their clothing catalogues and sizable neuroses in Illinois, and have transferred their insanity to their Weimaraner, Beatrice.Fern City, Florida men's wear salesman Gerry Fleck (Eugene Levy) could focus on Norwich Terrier Winkey if he could only stop running into men that slept with his wife Cookie (Catherine O'Hara). Apparently she married him because he was last in line.Probably most entertaining is New York dog handler Scott Donlan (John Michl Higgins) and his longtime partner, salon proprietor Stefan Vanderhoof (Michl McKean). Of their matching Shih Tzus, they believe Miss Agnes stands the best chance of winning.When the big show arrives, all must face the previous two-time winner, Poodle Rhapsody In White owned by decrepit millionaire Leslie Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw) and his young trophy wife Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge). To ensure success, Sherri Ann has hired professional dog handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch), but the two women are distracted by their, uh, mutual chemistry.Although similar in style, there are several differences between &quot;Best in Show&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;. While both movies credit Guest and Levy as writers, you can sense more in the way of structure in their newest work. This is probably due, in part, to another big change. &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; both followed a cast of characters, but those groups were, more or less, in pursuit of a single, unified goal. In &quot;Best of Show&quot;, the different characters starting from different locations and only come together to compete against each other for the same prize. As such, we don't get as much interaction between the different characters as we'd like. The final product also feels much denser as a result of cutting back and forth between all of their different storylines.Still, it all comes down to how good the cast is, and everyone delivers. Guest himself takes more of a backseat as his southern eccentric is usually by himself. Posey excels, as expected, in a part that allows her to be completely unhinged. Most of the cast do fine jobs, particularly Levy and O'Hara. There are, however, three standouts. First, Fred Willard is the funniest I've even seen him as a dog show announcer who doesn't know anything about dogs, or apparently what jokes might be inappropriate for the venue. Lynch, who had previously wallowed in television and bit movie parts, makes the most of this opportunity and matches the lunacy of anyone else present.Of everyone, there is one man who truly reaches a new plateau, and that man is John Michl Higgins. You know he's got to be good when Michl McKean plays the &quot;quiet one&quot; in the relationship. Forget Jack from &quot;Will and Grace&quot;, Higgins' Scott Donlan is the true queen of the ball. His flaming, naughty antics and wardrobe dominate the screen every time he's on. Frighteningly, the one thing I remember him from is his portrayal of David Letterman in HBO's adaptation of Bill Carter's &quot;The Late Shift&quot;. Yikes!Now, is this movie actually better than &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;? Mmmm, no. As that group of characters built toward something together, it had more punch in the end, rather than watching the new bunch take turns presenting their animals in the newer film. It's still a great movie. The point to these exercises, as both Reiner and Guest know, is not to just spend 90 minutes mocking the adventures of some exaggerated characters. The directors love all the inmates of their asylums, so the audience does too. Too often, when others try this kind of thing, their subjects are little more than a pile of absurd character tics. A full-length feature must be more developed than a half-assed &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit. The filmmakers don't just need to make us laugh, the must, as Guest has done, make us care.",5,Hilarious Mockumentary,1071705600,"12 18, 2003",2003,4887,"['Director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'may', 'have',

A frenzied visit to an upscale petshop uncovers lots of toys...just not the right one. The ultra-serious conversation between the haughty salesperson and the distraught dog owner is outrageous!As a dog lover myself, I could only lean back and howl over the all-too-human shenanigans of the owners and trainers. And just in case it's a tad too subtle for some of us, Fred Willard gives an inspired performance as a know-nothing television announcer calling the play-by-play, with his horrified partner, who DOES know about dog shows, standing helplessly by, unable to get a word in edgewise.While not as brilliant as Guest's &quot;Spinal Tap,&quot; &quot;Best in Show&quot; definitely ranks among the best in satirical humor.

Much of the comedy is sly - not the kind of humor that hits you over the head.  For example, look for the snack cracker that resembles a tongue, and also the &quot;ancient art of ventriloquy&quot; drawing.  Each of those gags was only on the screen for a second or two, but funny!  The casting was excellent, with SCTV vets O'Hara &amp; Levy, and Spinal Tapsters Guest and McKean.  Director Guest himself did a dead-on Southern accent as one of the dog owners.  Even the bit parts were filled by little known but superb comic talents such as Don Lake &amp; Larry Miller.  The DVD extras give you your money's worth, especially the 17 deleted scenes and Guest's commentary with Levy.  Unlike the average reviewer who automatically gives 5 stars to anything they see, I'm going with 4 stars for this one, since I got tired of the interplay between the announcers.
