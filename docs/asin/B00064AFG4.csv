859480,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00064AFG4,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 0]","""Mango Kiss"" is superior to what passes as most romantic comedies these days. It's a tongue in cheek study of gender roles, monogamy, and friendship. It's about the butch Lou (Michelle Wolff) moving into a San Franciscan apartment with her friend Sassafras (Daniele Ferraro) There's plenty of comedy based on Sassafras' hippie upbringing. Sassafras still grieves her parents' divorce, and rediscovers her father in Lou. It brings a whole new meaning toFather Figure.In San Francisco, they meet a panorama of quirky characters. A dominatrix runs a grocery stand; there's the bad boy rocker Micky who's actually a girl. Val&Leslie; look like the stereotypical '50s couple in the style ofLeave It To Beaver: The Complete Series... except they're both women. Sassafras and Lou decide to plunge into the counterculture. Sassafras flirts with being a dominant. Big Daddy happens to be a woman.""Mango Kiss"" has a thin plot, the dream sequences are beyond cheesy... and the constant narration is sly&funny; to keep it going. The food metaphors work, unlike the cinematic version ofLike Water for Chocolate. Lou compares the City by the Bay with a candy store. There are loving panoramas of celery, zucchini, cucumbers. At one point, the leads make delicious-looking mango sandwiches with edible flowers. At times, the movie looks good enough to eat.""Mango Kiss"" works as a fluffy cotton candy movie, but not as a substantial meal. It's a sweet escape.",3,Fruits and Nuts,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,1443,"['Mango', 'Kiss', 'superior', 'what', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'days', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'study', 'gender', 'roles', 'monogamy', 'friendship', 'butch', 'Lou', 'Michelle', 'Wolff', 'moving', 'San', 'Franciscan', 'apartment', 'friend', 'Sassafras', 'Daniele', 'Ferraro', 'plenty', 'comedy', 'based', 'Sassafras', 'hippie', 'upbringing', 'Sassafras', 'still', 'parents', 'divorce', 'father', 'Lou', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'toFather', 'Figure.In', 'San', 'Francisco', 'meet', 'panorama', 'quirky', 'characters', 'dominatrix', 'grocery', 'stand', 'bad', 'boy', 'rocker', 'Micky', 'who', 'actually', 'girl', 'Val', 'Leslie', 'look', 'stereotypical', ""'50s"", 'couple', 'style', 'ofLeave', 'Beaver', 'Complete', 'Series', ""'re"", 'women', 'Sassafras', 'Lou', 'decide', 'plunge', 'counterculture', 'flirts', 'being', 'dominant', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'be', 'woman', 'Mango', 'Kiss', 'thin', 'plot', 'dream', 'sequences', 'are', 'cheesy', 'constant', 'narration', 'sly', 'funny', 'keep', 'going', 'food', 'metaphors', 'work', 'cinematic', 'version', 'Water', 'Chocolate', 'Lou', 'City', 'Bay', 'candy', 'store', 'are', 'loving', 'panoramas', 'celery', 'zucchini', 'cucumbers', 'one', 'point', 'leads', 'make', 'delicious-looking', 'mango', 'sandwiches', 'edible', 'flowers', 'times', 'movie', 'good', 'enough', 'eat', 'Mango', 'Kiss', 'fluffy', 'cotton', 'candy', 'movie', 'not', 'substantial', 'meal', 'sweet', 'escape']",Mango Kiss

The script has passion and intelligence. The DVD menu offers behind-the-scenes footage and interesting interviews. Highly enjoyable, and recommended as an addition to your library, whether you are a devotee of the genre or not.Though partial to negative reviews, I am suspicious of some of the ones here that only give a blanket one-sentence justification for their one-star rating. I get the impression somebody doesn't like somebody associated with the movie, or is offended by the butch/femme stereotypes. I am lifting that comment from the one legitimate-sounding negative review that I marked as Helpful.

I will leave it up to the people who consider themselves experts on that topic to review it how they will. I doubt it was intended as a documentary or commentary on alternative lifestyles. That is just backdrop.I like it because it is a fun romp about serious topics - relationships and identity. It is clever, well paced, well acted, well shot, and well edited - in other words, a good film. That alone is difficult to do - witness most of what Hollyweird turns out.I liked the characters and cared about their journey, and it takes some pretty good story telling to lure this jaded old man.For those who find the sex and kink too much or too little, I think that misses the point of the film. There is quite a bit of social commentary for those who can see it. It is subtle and not pounding you over the head.I thought the sex was well balanced and well presented, given that it was a primary part of the plot.(spoiler of sorts)It even bows to the standard Hollyweird meme of monogamy as the &#34;proper&#34; relationship - which for many people it actually is.I found it cute, fun, and well worth the time.

First, Mango Kiss is only mildly entertaining.  Yes, it is sexy in a lesbian, kinky role playing kind of way.  But the comedy is slight, limited to some wry observations by Lou (Michelle Wolfe) who provides a voice-over narration that does little to move the story along.Lou and her friend Sassy (played by Daniele Ferraro) move to San Francisco to discover themselves and define their relationship.  That definition eventually evolves into ""captain and young boy"", which seems to work for the two lovers, were it not for Sassy's wandering eye and experimental libido.  Hence the errors.A psychologist would probably have a field day with this film as it trots out one alternative personality after another.  My problem is not with the roles that the characters indulge themselves in, so much as the idea that they have to immerse themselves so fully into these roles that their lives are taken over by the role playing.  The overriding question might be ""does Sassy love The Captain, or does she love Lou?  And is Lou really The Captain or just a personna for her to slip into from time to time?The script is uneven at best, but the collection of characters does provide some interest; from the neighbor couple that lives a 50's sitcom suburban lifestyle (albeit a lesbian 50's sitcom) to various punk rockers, S and M and bondage adherents.  Sally Kirkland provides some spark as Sassy's mother, a survivor of the Free Love generation, who is supportive yet still a little bewildered by the entire thing.There are far worse movies out there, but if you're looking for relationship insight or any kind of coherent story, consider something else.",2,Is it supposed to be about role playing or role blurring?,1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,1790,"['box', 'cover', 'bills', 'film', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'sexy', 'comedy', 'errors', 'overstatement', 'barely', 'forgivable', 'proportion', 'First', 'Mango', 'Kiss', 'only', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'Yes', 'sexy', 'lesbian', 'kinky', 'role', 'playing', 'kind', 'way', 'comedy', 'slight', 'limited', 'wry', 'observations', 'Lou', 'Michelle', 'Wolfe', 'who', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'little', 'move', 'story', 'along.Lou', 'friend', 'Sassy', 'played', 'Daniele', 'Ferraro', 'move', 'San', 'Francisco', 'discover', 'define', 'relationship', 'definition', 'eventually', 'captain', 'young', 'boy', 'work', 'two', 'lovers', 'were', 'not', 'Sassy', 'wandering', 'eye', 'experimental', 'libido', 'Hence', 'errors.A', 'psychologist', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'field', 'day', 'film', 'out', 'one', 'alternative', 'personality', 'problem', 'not', 'roles', 'characters', 'indulge', 'so', 'much', 'idea', 'have', 'immerse', 'so', 'fully', 'roles', 'lives', 'are', 'taken', 'over', 'role', 'playing', 'overriding', 'question', 'might', 'be', 'Sassy', 'love', 'Captain', 'love', 'Lou', 'Lou', 'really', 'Captain', 'just', 'personna', 'slip', 'time', 'time', 'script', 'uneven', 'best', 'collection', 'characters', 'provide', 'interest', 'neighbor', 'couple', '50', 'sitcom', 'suburban', 'lifestyle', 'lesbian', '50', 'sitcom', 'various', 'punk', 'rockers', 'S', 'M', 'bondage', 'adherents', 'Sally', 'Kirkland', 'spark', 'Sassy', 'mother', 'survivor', 'Free', 'Love', 'generation', 'who', 'supportive', 'yet', 'still', 'little', 'bewildered', 'entire', 'are', 'far', 'worse', 'movies', 'there', ""'re"", 'looking', 'relationship', 'insight', 'kind', 'coherent', 'story', 'consider', 'something', 'else']",Mango Kiss

For some weird reason, I wanted to watch it again. The next time, I viewed the movie as a comedy and it was hilarious! It was like watching a Lesbian Disneyland at play with some rather bizarre characters. At the same time, the characters are well-developed and show humanity which keeps them from turning into cartoons or caricatures. The S & M scenes are over-the-top, but that prevents them from being horrifying or painful to watch. To me, they are some of the funniest (yet weirdest) scenes in the whole movie.Sass and Lou are two friends who move to San Francisco. Their relationship turns to that of lovers, but then the two decide to have a non-monogamous role-playing relationship. She and Lou adopt a Daddy/Girl relationship, where Lou is the ""Captain"" and Sass is the Princess. Along the way, the two meet other couples in role-playing relationships. There's Val and Leslie, a 1950s couple, who are an absolute hoot and remind me of my parents. Lou becomes less than enchanted with non-monogamy, but reluctantly goes along to please Sass. A newly minted Lesbian, Sass goes wild and starts having affairs with all sorts of women. She starts a Mother/Son S & M relationship with Mickey, who Lou clearly detests. Sass accepts Lou's attraction to her Store-Manager-By-Day-Dominatrix-By-Night boss Chelsea Chuwawa, but is disconcerted and threatened by Lou's attraction to the ultra-feminine 1950s, locket-wearing Leslie. A delightful character in the mix is Sass' Hippie Artist mother, Emilia, played to perfection by Sally Kirkland, who offers sage advice and cautions her daughter about her new open relationship. Things come to a head and Sass finally is smacked back to reality when she realizes she might lose Lou if their open relationship continues.This film is about two women finding their way in San Francisco's Queer community, experimenting, then realizing what type of relationship works for them. Chelsea and Emilia guide and advise them along the way.If S & M scenes bother you, then I wouldn't recommend this film. This film may offend those who are in such relationships depicted in this film, but this film is meant to be a comedy, not a realistic portrayal.

In addition to great acting and good production, the script is sexy, intelligent, fearless, adventurous, comical, and unique.It's 1993, San Francisco, and Lou (Michelle Wolfe) and Sassy (Danielle Feraro) find themselves in the middle of an exhilarating journey of steamy unexpected San Francisco fun. Shortly after moving to the city, they are working in a small grocery store with a sexy dominatrix boss; living upstairs from a queer couple who has been stuck in an unhappy, rigid-gender-roled, sexless relationship for years; and finding themselves overall living in a whole new world: San Francisco. Diving head first into a sexy non-monogamous S&M; dyke scene full of gender-variance and radical roles, the two lovebirds learn more than they could ever expect.Mango Kiss is a brilliant and unique portrayal of queer love outside of traditional boundaries.
