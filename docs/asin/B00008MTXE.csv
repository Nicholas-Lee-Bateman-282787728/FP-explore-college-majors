It quickly turns from platonic to lust without the characters at least getting to know each other well. . .just another movie with empty, meaningless sex.  I found it stupid and offensive.

She is tired of her father-in-law and other people in her picturesque town of Sweetwater, CO, being tired of HER unhappiness. Out of desperation she hires a ""boyfriend"" from an escort agency, and tells him to sweep her off her feet whenever they're in public to convince everyone they're seriously involved.While the premise was appealing, the reality was a bit more mottled. Garnet, as both doctor and grieving wife, I found less than convincing. Claiming to have no interest in romance, she nevertheless behaves in an immature and needy, please-love-me-come-hither manner. She treats her long-suffering hiree with disdain, even while availing herself fully (and I do mean fully) of his ""services"", (calling him a ""prostitute"", for example, even when later she crawls under the covers with him, wearing lingerie and claiming all she wants is a snuggle... hmm).The movie seems to be all about what the lad can do for her, a grief-stricken, lonely, beautiful, inconsistent and at times selfish woman... while she offers him little in return except verbal abuse.
