1059508,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B000NPASR2,Anne-Marie G,"[2, 2]","Note: This review is for the drama and not this specific DVD set.I enjoyed this show while I was watching it, but overall it wasn't all that memorable for me. (I am looking up character names to write this review and having really jog my memory over what they did in the show, whoops.) It is a 'forced cohabitation' drama, as I am learning is a common trope in K-Dramas.It starts with the worst friends ever. No joke. Dong-wook and Hee-jin have been friends with Jee-eun since they were kids.  DW and HJ just found out that they are expecting a baby (this is probably the silliest pregnancy in TV history that I have seen, no baby bump...it pretty much is convenient whenever HJ needs an excuse not to do something--which is in character).  Neither has any money, but their friend, poor Jee-eun, who also doesn't have much does have the house her father left her.  They some how scrape together enough money to convince her she has won a free trip to Hong Kong and send her off with a one way ticket.  While she is gone they sell her house and empty her bank accounts.She has the luck on the plane to sit next to Lee Young-jae.  He happens to be an obscenely famous actor. He is also wearing a vomit inducing shirt. It is a seriously loud print and she does get motion sick...all over it... (His fashion through the whole show is sort of awful.  This was made beforeBoys Over Flowers - Korean Drama Complete Set (8 DVDs with English Subtitles)which from what I've read was a bench mark in Korean male fashion.  He has wide lapels, loose fitting pants and atrocious prints...)  He wants nothing more to do with her--which is pretty understandable.  While she, as she slowly figures out just how stranded in Hong Kong she is, comes begging to him for help.  She ends up pretending to be romantically involved with a friend of his ( and in comes the secondary male lead) in order to get enough money to fly home.Both think they are done with the other at this juncture. Of course not, what sort of drama would that be? Who bought Jee-eun's house but Young-jae.  He feels bad enough for her situation to agree to let her stay there if she will be his housekeeper. However, his unrequited love, Hye-won, drives him to a crazy place where he thinks being married to Jee-Eun for a year in fake arrangement would be better.  Hye-won, herself, has a case of unrequited love for the man that Jee-eun pretended to be involved with earlier, Yoo Min-hyuk. Ah love square.Bi/Rain is great with the twinkling boyish charm that Young-jae needs to get away with the stunts he pulls. There is always a wonderful little twinkle in his eye. Song Hye-gyo is adorable as Jee-eun and the woman is impressive for the number of times she is running all over Korea and Hong Kong in crazy heels. (I'm not kidding, she has tons of running scenes and they are all in shoes that were meant to be cute not comfy.)A pretty enjoyable romantic romp, but like I said, it has already faded pretty quickly from my memory and it has only been a few weeks since I watched it.",4,"A little forgettable, but enjoyable none the less",1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,3036,"['Note', 'review', 'drama', 'not', 'specific', 'DVD', 'set.I', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'was', 'watching', 'overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'am', 'looking', 'up', 'character', 'names', 'write', 'review', 'having', 'really', 'jog', 'memory', 'what', 'did', 'show', 'whoops', ""'forced"", 'cohabitation', 'drama', 'am', 'learning', 'common', 'trope', 'K-Dramas.It', 'starts', 'worst', 'friends', 'ever', 'joke', 'Dong-wook', 'Hee-jin', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'Jee-eun', 'were', 'kids', 'DW', 'HJ', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'are', 'expecting', 'baby', 'probably', 'silliest', 'pregnancy', 'TV', 'history', 'have', 'seen', 'baby', 'bump', 'pretty', 'much', 'convenient', 'whenever', 'HJ', 'excuse', 'not', 'do', 'something', 'character', 'money', 'friend', 'poor', 'Jee-eun', 'who', 'also', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'have', 'house', 'father', 'left', 'how', 'scrape', 'together', 'enough', 'money', 'convince', 'won', 'free', 'trip', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'send', 'off', 'one', 'way', 'ticket', 'gone', 'sell', 'house', 'empty', 'bank', 'accounts.She', 'luck', 'plane', 'sit', 'next', 'Lee', 'Young-jae', 'be', 'obscenely', 'famous', 'actor', 'also', 'wearing', 'vomit', 'inducing', 'shirt', 'seriously', 'loud', 'print', 'get', 'motion', 'sick', 'fashion', 'whole', 'show', 'sort', 'awful', 'was', 'made', 'beforeBoys', 'Flowers', 'Korean', 'Drama', 'Complete', 'Set', '8', 'DVDs', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'was', 'bench', 'mark', 'Korean', 'male', 'fashion', 'wide', 'lapels', 'loose', 'fitting', 'pants', 'atrocious', 'prints', 'nothing', 'more', 'do', 'pretty', 'understandable', 'slowly', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'stranded', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'begging', 'help', 'up', 'pretending', 'be', 'romantically', 'involved', 'friend', 'secondary', 'male', 'lead', 'order', 'get', 'enough', 'money', 'fly', 'think', 'are', 'done', 'other', 'juncture', 'course', 'not', 'what', 'sort', 'drama', 'would', 'be', 'Who', 'bought', 'Jee-eun', 'house', 'Young-jae', 'bad', 'enough', 'situation', 'agree', 'let', 'stay', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'housekeeper', 'However', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Hye-won', 'crazy', 'place', 'where', 'being', 'married', 'Jee-Eun', 'year', 'fake', 'arrangement', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'Hye-won', 'herself', 'case', 'unrequited', 'love', 'man', 'Jee-eun', 'pretended', 'be', 'involved', 'earlier', 'Yoo', 'Min-hyuk', 'Ah', 'love', 'square.Bi/Rain', 'great', 'twinkling', 'boyish', 'charm', 'Young-jae', 'get', 'away', 'stunts', 'always', 'wonderful', 'little', 'twinkle', 'eye', 'Song', 'Hye-gyo', 'adorable', 'Jee-eun', 'woman', 'impressive', 'number', 'times', 'running', 'Korea', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'crazy', 'heels', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'tons', 'running', 'scenes', 'are', 'shoes', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'cute', 'not', 'comfy', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'romantic', 'romp', 'said', 'already', 'faded', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'memory', 'only', 'been', 'few', 'weeks', 'watched']","KOREAN TV SERIES "" FULL HOUSE """
