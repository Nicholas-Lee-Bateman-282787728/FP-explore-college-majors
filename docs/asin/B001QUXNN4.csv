1232212,AOB5695UUUJ0,B001QUXNN4,"Anime Lover ""D""","[1, 1]","There is intelligent life out there, and Earth is where they have come to live and visit.  Kazyo runs his families bathhouse (much to the displeasure of his parents) with his younger sister to bring comfort and enjoyment to the locals residents and visitors, at least until a starship crashes into the roof killing him.  But all is not lost (or this would have been a very short series), the pilot Princess Valkyrie of Valhalla (the youngest and most attractive princess of the planet who was running away from an arranged marriage) brings him back to life by offering half her soul, but at the cost of her going from bodacious to baby sized.  Then things get weird.  Throw in a militant, cat-eared maid, his sister, his childhood friend who has a severe crush on him, the other 6 princesses of Valhalla, the fact that his dog Spot was a former mercenary pilot of great fame, and not to mention that he is now Valkyrie's fiancee and people are after her (but that is okay, for when they kiss Valkyrie goes from pint sized to eye popping. Can Kazyo bring success to the bathhouse and eventually marry the girl of his dreams.I have all these on original disks (including the OVA's)and I have to admit I was taken for a loop with this. This is a reprint of Seasons 1&2, so do not expect anything new. The Ecchii level is a little more than most romantic comedies and the situations can go a little over the top, but overall the story was a fun filled romp as two people from different worlds (literally) try to find happiness and hopefully not lose their minds while doing it.",5,An interstellar incident waiting to happen,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,1573,"['intelligent', 'life', 'there', 'Earth', 'where', 'have', 'come', 'live', 'visit', 'Kazyo', 'families', 'bathhouse', 'much', 'displeasure', 'parents', 'younger', 'sister', 'bring', 'comfort', 'enjoyment', 'locals', 'residents', 'visitors', 'least', 'starship', 'crashes', 'roof', 'killing', 'not', 'lost', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'short', 'series', 'pilot', 'Princess', 'Valkyrie', 'Valhalla', 'youngest', 'most', 'attractive', 'princess', 'planet', 'who', 'was', 'running', 'away', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'back', 'life', 'offering', 'half', 'soul', 'cost', 'going', 'bodacious', 'baby', 'sized', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'weird', 'Throw', 'militant', 'cat-eared', 'maid', 'sister', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'severe', 'crush', 'other', '6', 'princesses', 'Valhalla', 'fact', 'dog', 'Spot', 'was', 'former', 'mercenary', 'pilot', 'great', 'fame', 'not', 'mention', 'now', 'Valkyrie', 'fiancee', 'people', 'are', 'okay', 'when', 'kiss', 'Valkyrie', 'pint', 'sized', 'eye', 'popping', 'Can', 'Kazyo', 'bring', 'success', 'bathhouse', 'eventually', 'marry', 'girl', 'dreams.I', 'have', 'original', 'disks', 'including', 'OVA', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'taken', 'loop', 'reprint', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'anything', 'new', 'Ecchii', 'level', 'little', 'more', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'situations', 'can', 'go', 'little', 'top', 'story', 'was', 'fun', 'filled', 'romp', 'two', 'people', 'different', 'worlds', 'literally', 'try', 'find', 'happiness', 'hopefully', 'not', 'lose', 'minds', 'doing']",UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie: Seasons 1 & 2

In a sense similar to Love Hina this has plenty of girls along with plenty of laughs. You get season 1 and 2 plus a couple of OVA's so it's actually a pretty good deal for your price. Although it is a romance anime, don't expect it to be very deep. It's more of a comedy type thing but don't let that stop you.

But for anyone who buys this be warned the DVDs come in a stack-pack format. This means all the disc are stacked on top of each other. This can cause damage to your DVDs and its hard to get to the disc you want to watch. I was not happy about this.

In order to make amends she gives a portion of her soul to Kazuto and swears to marry him. Unfortunately she is transformed into a child when she does this. There are bunches of other Valhallan princesses and pirates that have other plans for her.This anime is a lighthearted story. It has a sweet and fun-filled mood about it. It is the kind of anime that makes you fell all warm and tingly inside. It's so much fun.

1232219,A2BQWICLI9J7YN,B001QUXNN4,seshomarou,"[2, 2]","This is a confusing series at first. I thought they had the episodes in the wrong order or something, but they just sort of had a jump start. I love the theme music to this show, and both the japanese and the english voice acting is wonderful. The animation hits the spot. It is not upper crust, but it really sets the proper mood for the show, sort of like school rumble, which I also love. If you do not like silliness this anime is not for you. But if you like wacky comedy that delves into an occasional dramatic side, then this series is well balanced. One or two episodes do test the bounderies of mayhem, but it stayed true enough to the story to keep it going. Valkyrie is an alien princess from the planet Valhalla, who has run away from an arranged marriage, and in the process crashed her ship into the Tokino Bathhouse mortally wounding the young ""Manboy"" who inherited it, Kazuto Tokino. To keep him from dying, Valkyrie gives him half of her soul to keep forever, which reduces her to a child, however whenever the souls of Valkyrei and Kazuto are perfectly aligned she can reclaim her true form for a short time ( a transformation which provides mere fan service insues, and transformations of other characters abound as well supplying further fan service). While in her adult form Valkyrie has amazing powers and wields ""The Key of Time"". Naturaly, the two drag their friends and family into many insaine adventures, and comedy abouds. It is a really fun show to watch, but the music is absolutly beautiful, Decembr Princess, Meguriai, Agape, All in All, and Itoshii Kakera are my favorites. I also bought the soundtrack UFO Princess Valkyrie: Best Theme Songs. This set includes the first two seasons, with two bridal training episodes in between, on five discs, wich are so hard to get out of the container, that I put them in separate cd holders to keep from damaging them while getting them out. All in all a great purchase! Season 1 has 12 episodes. Then there are 2 bonus episodes. Season 2 also has 12 episodes, for a total of 26 episodes. seasons 3 and 4 are sold on a separate save dvd.
