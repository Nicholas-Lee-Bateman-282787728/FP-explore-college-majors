Most of the episodes were in the sure hands of regulars Harry Harris Jr. and Andrew V. Laglen;  one exception is &#34;He Learned About Women&#34; directed by veteran feature film helmer Tay Garnett.  As in previous seasons the writers were mainly the ever reliable John Meston and Kathleen Hite.  Lots of really good female roles in this batch and some of the fine actresses featured include Joan Hackett, Barbara Luna, Bethel Leslie, Sue Ane Langdon, Dianne Foster and Ellen McRae (later known as Ellen Burstyn). Among the men, watch out for Edgar Buchanan, Claude Akins, Jeremy Slate, John Kerr, Andrew Prine, George Kennedy, Andy Clyde, Michael Parks, Arch Johnson and Conrad Nagel.As always, faultless production values complimented the fine writing and acting in this wonderful series and we haven't even mentioned the brilliant ensemble of regulars - James Arness, Dennis Weaver, Amanda Blake and Milburn Stone.

Raby ""OleJoe""","[0, 0]","I purchased this DVD set for a single episode -- &#34;Chester's Indian&#34; -- that featured then 19-year old actress Jena Engstrom in the second of her two appearances on the Gunsmoke TV series.  Her first appeances was earlier that year as the Milly in the episode of that name that appears in the volume 1 of season 7 DVD set.  Jena Engstrom is a forgotten actress today.  I am her age but did not discover her work until a couple of years ago when I saw her in one of her three appearances on the Have Gun - Will Travel TV series.  Not everything she appeared in was good, but she was, and the two Gunsmoke episodes gave her two of her best roles in the 37 shows she did between 1961 and 1964 before giving up acting because of a nervous breakdown (to use the language of the newspaper artices of the time).  What I appreciated about Jena Engstrom was that each character was unique and that a character in one episode is unlike a character in another.  A thing I like about the Gunsmoke series is that the stories were character-driven and the series stars did not always have to be the main character in each episode.  I don't have a complaint about the series but in viewing them from today's vantage point it seems like Gunsmoke's Dodge City existed in some type of time warp -- the 20-years of episodes all took place in about 1872 while the characters Matt and Kitty and Doc aged 20 years.",5,Chester's Indian with Jena Engstrom,1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,1399,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'set', 'single', 'episode', '34', 'Chester', 'Indian', '34', 'featured', 'then', '19-year', 'old', 'actress', 'Jena', 'Engstrom', 'second', 'two', 'appearances', 'Gunsmoke', 'TV', 'series', 'first', 'appeances', 'was', 'earlier', 'year', 'Milly', 'episode', 'name', 'volume', '1', 'season', '7', 'DVD', 'set', 'Jena', 'Engstrom', 'forgotten', 'actress', 'today', 'am', 'age', 'did', 'not', 'discover', 'work', 'couple', 'years', 'when', 'saw', 'one', 'three', 'appearances', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'TV', 'series', 'Not', 'everything', 'appeared', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'two', 'Gunsmoke', 'episodes', 'gave', 'two', 'best', 'roles', '37', 'shows', 'did', '1961', '1964', 'giving', 'up', 'acting', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'use', 'language', 'newspaper', 'artices', 'time', 'What', 'appreciated', 'Jena', 'Engstrom', 'was', 'character', 'was', 'unique', 'character', 'one', 'episode', 'character', 'thing', 'like', 'Gunsmoke', 'series', 'stories', 'were', 'character-driven', 'series', 'stars', 'did', 'not', 'always', 'have', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'complaint', 'series', 'viewing', 'today', 'vantage', 'point', 'Gunsmoke', 'Dodge', 'City', 'existed', 'type', 'time', 'warp', '20-years', 'episodes', 'took', 'place', '1872', 'characters', 'Matt', 'Kitty', 'Doc', 'aged', '20', 'years']","Gunsmoke: Season 7, Vol. 2"

One of the most powerful episodes, to date, is included in this part of Season Seven (The Gallows), written by the great John Meston. I highly recommend not reading the episode synopsis of the shows in the case, as they tend to give away too much of the shows' plot.At some point in the first-run of Gunsmoke, the shows started repeating themselves, and I lost interest, but I am nowhere near that point through seven seasons. Growing up without a TV until well into the ""Festus"" years, I had completley missed the ""Chester"" years, so am enjoying those, although Chester seems to be at a complete disadvantage against Doc Adams, whereas Festus always gave as good as he got.My one and only complaint with this series is the extremely high price the company is charging for half-seasons.

There were no better characterizations anywhere and most of the episodic stories were real and believable.  James Arness' Matt Dillion is as whole an individual as John Wayne's Ethan Edwards  or Clint Eastwood's William Muny and has his flaws as well.  No other TV western, (and few TV dramas of any sort) ever came close to the quality of the characterizations of Gunsmoke.That being said, the hour long Gunsmoke shows, to some extent changed the emphasis, and became almost a western showcase theater where the major characters; Matt, Chester, Doc, and Kitty, became supporting actors behind some guest star of the week. This weakened the show and lead to it's eventual decline. Folks wanted to see Matt Dillion!
