1152385,A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB,B001675YNY,"ANT ""azraelart""","[0, 0]","This is the original first season of Storm Chasers, which was a surprise to me at first when I found out about it.  I watched the series on Netflix, and what they call Season 1 is actually Season 2.  So, I was immediately thrown off to start with, but that's not Amazon's fault.  Not sure where the confusion lies, but no biggie, finally sorted it out, I think.There was also another show called Perfect Disaster, which I also don't think was very clear to me.  But, given that the first season of Storm Chasers is only four episodes long (only about 40 minutes each without commercials), then it was nice of Discovery to bundle the two shows into one.  I guess.Storm Chasers:This first season follows only one crew, that of Dr. Josh Wurman and his DOW (Doppler on Wheels) and extreme IMAX film producer/director Sean Casey and his TIV (Tornado Intercept Vehicle).  Both have different end goals, but the same main drive: to guide the TIV inside a live tornado.  Josh wants the scientific data that will provide, and Sean wants the 'be-all-end-all' tornado shot for his IMAX film, &#34;Tornado Alley.&#34;There is the obvious tension between the two, as their motivations are vastly different.  Both need each other to achieve their goals, but their methods and mindsets are pretty different.  Having not seen this season before, I was surprised at the amount of tension between the two teams, even among the team members.  I think they tend to play those up through editing and narration, though, which gets a little old and trite after a while.Still, the payoff is there: shots of violent thunderstorms and tornadoes throughout the season.  While only four episodes long, it was still pretty intense.  What's more, there weren't many tornadoes on film that year, but this to me was realistic given how some seasons are better/worse than others.  Also, not every chase ends well, which I found the series did a great job of pointing out.  To me, the expectations were realistic, and we got what we should have expected.  A lot of waiting, a lot of tension, and then the frantic rush once that first warning is announced.Overall, this was a well-made series, and I'm glad it was successful enough to spawn several more seasons to follow.  The narration and editing build false drama, which gets annoying at times, but if you can look beyond that, especially at the camera work required to get some of these images, it's well worth the viewing.  Also, the deleted scenes were a nice surprise!Perfect Disaster:Aptly named!Kidding, but only kind of.  I'm not sure why they lumped this show together with Storm Chasers, but I'm guessing it's because most of the disasters were storm-related.  Be warned, though, this is NOT the same documentary style offering with injected melodrama for 'excitement's sake.'  This is ALL MELODRAMA.Saving graces: the science is sound.  They take time to explain how storms work (at least on the tornado episode... still haven't watched the others yet).  I think Storm Chasers could have used more of this, actually.  These shows are a perfect place to insert some hard science, so you could totally pass them off as educational materials.  Storm Chasers, anyway.Pitfalls: it's all fiction.  These are basically designed to scare you with what MIGHT happen someday, according to SOME scientists, though there isn't any precedence for any of it to happen to the scale they are pretending it will.  Think 2012 (the movie), worst case scenarios.  Why?  What's the point?  Hardly worth your time, when reality is far more frightening (because it can actually happen, and already has happened), and when you can make up any scenario you want in your own mind.Again, the science was worth it, but having to watch the family drama unfold with shady CGI, shaky plots, bad acting, and stunted scripts is not in the same vein as actual storm chasers in the field.  If this is your thing, though, you should enjoy it.I'm not dinging the overall rating too much, though, because of the strength of Storm Chasers.  This was the pilot season that launched the series, and it was well worth it in my opinion.  This set is a must-own for storm fans, though you might have to live with having Perfect Disaster living alongside it.",4,"Great documentary, though it has a few flaws",1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,4242,"['original', 'first', 'season', 'Storm', 'Chasers', 'was', 'surprise', 'first', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'watched', 'series', 'Netflix', 'what', 'call', 'Season', '1', 'actually', 'Season', '2', 'So', 'was', 'immediately', 'thrown', 'off', 'start', 'not', 'Amazon', 'fault', 'Not', 'sure', 'where', 'confusion', 'biggie', 'finally', 'sorted', 'out', 'think.There', 'was', 'also', 'show', 'called', 'Perfect', 'Disaster', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'very', 'clear', 'given', 'first', 'season', 'Storm', 'Chasers', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'long', 'only', 'about', '40', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'then', 'was', 'nice', 'Discovery', 'bundle', 'two', 'shows', 'one', 'guess.Storm', 'Chasers', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'one', 'crew', 'Dr.', 'Josh', 'Wurman', 'DOW', 'Doppler', 'Wheels', 'extreme', 'IMAX', 'film', 'producer/director', 'Sean', 'Casey', 'TIV', 'Tornado', 'Intercept', 'Vehicle', 'have', 'different', 'end', 'goals', 'same', 'main', 'drive', 'guide', 'TIV', 'live', 'tornado', 'Josh', 'scientific', 'data', 'will', 'provide', 'Sean', ""'be-all-end-all"", 'tornado', 'shot', 'IMAX', 'film', '34', 'Tornado', 'Alley.', '34', 'obvious', 'tension', 'two', 'motivations', 'are', 'vastly', 'different', 'need', 'other', 'achieve', 'goals', 'methods', 'mindsets', 'are', 'pretty', 'different', 'Having', 'not', 'seen', 'season', 'was', 'surprised', 'amount', 'tension', 'two', 'teams', 'even', 'team', 'members', 'think', 'tend', 'play', 'editing', 'narration', 'little', 'old', 'trite', 'while.Still', 'payoff', 'there', 'shots', 'violent', 'thunderstorms', 'tornadoes', 'season', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'long', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'intense', 'What', 'more', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'tornadoes', 'film', 'year', 'was', 'realistic', 'given', 'how', 'seasons', 'are', 'better/worse', 'others', 'Also', 'not', 'chase', 'well', 'found', 'series', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'pointing', 'out', 'expectations', 'were', 'realistic', 'got', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'expected', 'lot', 'waiting', 'lot', 'tension', 'then', 'frantic', 'rush', 'once', 'first', 'warning', 'announced.Overall', 'was', 'well-made', 'series', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'successful', 'enough', 'spawn', 'several', 'more', 'seasons', 'follow', 'narration', 'editing', 'build', 'false', 'drama', 'annoying', 'times', 'can', 'look', 'especially', 'camera', 'work', 'required', 'get', 'images', 'well', 'viewing', 'Also', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'nice', 'surprise', 'Perfect', 'Disaster', 'Aptly', 'named', 'Kidding', 'only', 'kind', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'lumped', 'show', 'together', 'Storm', 'Chasers', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'most', 'disasters', 'were', 'storm-related', 'Be', 'warned', 'though', 'NOT', 'same', 'documentary', 'style', 'offering', 'injected', 'melodrama', ""'excitement"", 'sake', 'MELODRAMA.Saving', 'graces', 'science', 'sound', 'take', 'time', 'explain', 'how', 'storms', 'work', 'least', 'tornado', 'episode', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'others', 'yet', 'think', 'Storm', 'Chasers', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'actually', 'shows', 'are', 'perfect', 'place', 'insert', 'hard', 'science', 'could', 'totally', 'pass', 'off', 'educational', 'materials', 'Storm', 'Chasers', 'anyway.Pitfalls', 'fiction', 'are', 'basically', 'designed', 'scare', 'what', 'MIGHT', 'happen', 'someday', 'according', 'SOME', 'scientists', ""n't"", 'precedence', 'happen', 'scale', 'are', 'pretending', 'will', 'Think', '2012', 'movie', 'worst', 'case', 'scenarios', 'Why', 'What', 'point', 'Hardly', 'time', 'when', 'reality', 'far', 'more', 'frightening', 'can', 'actually', 'happen', 'already', 'happened', 'when', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'scenario', 'want', 'own', 'mind.Again', 'science', 'was', 'worth', 'having', 'watch', 'family', 'drama', 'unfold', 'shady', 'CGI', 'shaky', 'plots', 'bad', 'acting', 'stunted', 'scripts', 'not', 'same', 'vein', 'actual', 'storm', 'chasers', 'field', 'thing', 'though', 'should', 'enjoy', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'dinging', 'overall', 'rating', 'too', 'much', 'though', 'strength', 'Storm', 'Chasers', 'was', 'pilot', 'season', 'launched', 'series', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'opinion', 'set', 'must-own', 'storm', 'fans', 'might', 'have', 'live', 'having', 'Perfect', 'Disaster', 'living']",Storm Chasers/Perfect Disaster

The show documents IMAX film maker Sean Casey and Dr. Josh Wurman as they drive through Tornado Alley in search of some of the most powerful storms on the planet, tornadoes. Sean's goal is to film a tornado as it impacts him from his 14,000 lb custom built Tornado Intercept Vehicle. Josh's goal is to collect scientific data to better understand these powerful storms. This set contains the first season of the show which is just 4 episodes. Although season one is short the content of each show is fantastic. While the show is fun to watch, it also very informative and you can learn alot about weather from watching the episodes. Storm Chasers is the best show on television about storms and weather.The second disc in this set is called Perfect Disaster. There are 6 episodes to this set and they are documentaries that deal with what would happen if a major natural disaster were to hit large metropolitan areas.

1152389,AQ65579F7SYVX,B001675YNY,SaosinEngaged,"[2, 4]","I'm a weather junkie. Short of a meteorology degree, I know a lot about supercell activity and tornado formation. This stuff is very interesting and I've always wanted to see a tornado in person, but I live in the wrong part of the country. In another life, perhaps.The point is; storm chasing is incredibly exciting. It's a visceral experience unlike anything else, and for some reason the people in this documentary just seem too cautious/unenthusiastic about the whole thing. It's off-putting. You can get better, more exciting footage of tornadoes by opening the outbreak segments of Wikipedia, looking at the lists and classifications of the known tornadoes from a particular outbreak, and scanning Youtube for the corresponding tornado with (mostly) amateur footage of the storms.I mean, this guy Josh relies way too much on his computer models, and the irony is that within the very show he is shown to be wrong/having miscalculated numerous times. All the while, the rest of the team is viewing the actual weather with their eyes, and this meteorologist is contradicting them with computer models that ended up being wrong more than they're right. It's frustrating to watch, instead of fun. The culmination is when Josh, our buddy the ""always wrong overly cautious"" leader, improperly predicts storm formation to eastern Kansas, while Sean, the intuitive ""photographer"" storm chaser accurately calls development to the south. That development resulted in one of the worst tornadoes in history, the Greensburg tornado. Obviously storm chasing isn't an exact science and mistakes are a given, but this guy makes so many mistakes throughout some of the episodes that it kind of hampers the enjoyment of it. Ultimately, the stormchasers that rely a bit more on intuition and experience are much more engaging to watch and because the leader of this series is a cautious, conservative ""radar watcher,"" the show suffers from it and is less interesting than it should be.To be honest, as annoying as he is, I actually prefer the videos Reed Timmer makes. He's a lot younger, more enthusiastic and focused, and more willing to take the risks which often result in larger payoffs/better footage. I'm not saying with something like storm chasing that being a wild card is better, but I get the impression in this series that the chasers here are just a little too cautious and a little too focused on their instrumentation rather than the epic views of the vicious weather all around them.The show is not bad, but it could (and should) be much better.",3,"Honestly, this series should be a LOT more interesting...",1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,2549,"[""'m"", 'weather', 'junkie', 'Short', 'meteorology', 'degree', 'know', 'lot', 'supercell', 'activity', 'tornado', 'formation', 'stuff', 'very', 'interesting', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'tornado', 'person', 'live', 'wrong', 'part', 'country', 'life', 'perhaps.The', 'point', 'storm', 'chasing', 'incredibly', 'exciting', 'visceral', 'experience', 'anything', 'else', 'reason', 'people', 'documentary', 'just', 'seem', 'too', 'cautious/unenthusiastic', 'whole', 'thing', 'off-putting', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'more', 'exciting', 'footage', 'tornadoes', 'opening', 'outbreak', 'segments', 'Wikipedia', 'looking', 'lists', 'classifications', 'known', 'tornadoes', 'particular', 'outbreak', 'scanning', 'Youtube', 'corresponding', 'tornado', 'mostly', 'amateur', 'footage', 'storms.I', 'mean', 'guy', 'Josh', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'computer', 'models', 'irony', 'very', 'show', 'shown', 'be', 'wrong/having', 'miscalculated', 'numerous', 'times', 'while', 'rest', 'team', 'viewing', 'actual', 'weather', 'eyes', 'meteorologist', 'contradicting', 'computer', 'models', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'more', ""'re"", 'right', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'instead', 'fun', 'culmination', 'when', 'Josh', 'always', 'wrong', 'overly', 'cautious', 'leader', 'improperly', 'storm', 'formation', 'eastern', 'Kansas', 'Sean', 'intuitive', 'photographer', 'storm', 'chaser', 'accurately', 'development', 'south', 'development', 'resulted', 'one', 'worst', 'tornadoes', 'history', 'Greensburg', 'tornado', 'Obviously', 'storm', 'chasing', ""n't"", 'exact', 'science', 'mistakes', 'are', 'given', 'guy', 'so', 'many', 'mistakes', 'episodes', 'kind', 'hampers', 'enjoyment', 'Ultimately', 'stormchasers', 'rely', 'bit', 'more', 'intuition', 'experience', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'engaging', 'watch', 'leader', 'series', 'cautious', 'conservative', 'radar', 'watcher', 'show', 'less', 'interesting', 'should', 'be.To', 'be', 'honest', 'as', 'annoying', 'actually', 'prefer', 'videos', 'Reed', 'Timmer', 'lot', 'younger', 'more', 'enthusiastic', 'focused', 'more', 'willing', 'take', 'risks', 'often', 'result', 'larger', 'payoffs/better', 'footage', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'something', 'storm', 'chasing', 'being', 'wild', 'card', 'better', 'get', 'impression', 'series', 'chasers', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'cautious', 'little', 'too', 'focused', 'instrumentation', 'rather', 'epic', 'views', 'vicious', 'weather', 'them.The', 'show', 'not', 'bad', 'could', 'should', 'be', 'much', 'better']",Storm Chasers/Perfect Disaster
