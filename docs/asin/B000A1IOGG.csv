This movie is only watchable because I've never seen a movie like it. It wasn't exactly offensive or shocking to me, except the scenes where a grown man has sex with a child. What bothered me throughout the movie is how in the sex scenes, each girl is completely emotionless like nothing is even happening. Not a sound, not a movement, no facial expression....you can say ""blah blah shes desensitized to the situation and cold inside"", but come on, so unrealistic. And it was painful to watch a CLEARLY 30-something year old actress (the obese black one) try to act 12 years old. I enjoyed the scenes where the hitman kills that abortionist, it seemed really believable to me how freaked out he was....good acting in that scene. I REALLY disliked that little black girl in the beginning and ending of the film...yeah, shes cute, but can she talk anymore robotic? Like she is reading from cue cards, and why can't she keep her weird tongue in her mouth while she talks? It's creepy. This movie isn't very interesting or filled with much emotion, but I wanted to see what would happen next.

918532,AN8K6OR4NKI0V,B000A1IOGG,Bruno,"[4, 5]","Once again Tod Solondz brings us a film that shakes us out of our liberal moral complacencies, providing an experience that is disturbing and yet touching, and in this case deeply philosophical. On the surface an examination of the abortion debate, in fact Solondz uses the fanatically held yet muddled convictions of proponents on both sides as a means to explore deeper questions of who we are and how we can find meaning in life.Both liberal pro-choicers and Christian pro-lifers share the conviction that human individuals have the power to choose who to be and how to act.For the Christian, individuals have the power to choose between good and evil. God has granted us the power to define our very souls and to be granted everlasting heaven or hell. Homosexuals can be 'saved'. Even paedophiles like the character Earl can be born again.For the liberal on the other hand, the only thing constraining choice is that of unfavourable power relationships. Society may determine the choices that women want to make i.e. wishing to have children, or deny them the choice at all.Solondz presents the journey of Aviva as a darkly grim fairytale that reveals a different kind of truth about human nature. People don't change. They might get a facelift, lose weight, spend dollars on breast enlargement, in other words change their appearance and gain acceptance in society, but they always stay the same. The need to believe in free will, the ability to change and to control your destiny is fundamental to almost all creeds and dogmas and indeed across the American political spectrum. It is essential to our notions of morality, to praise and blame, reward and punishment, to who we are and to what we may become.But there is no free will. In the end we finish up the same people we were at the beginning. Despite her many weird experiences, at the end of her journey Aviva is a lot older and wiser, but still the same child she was at the beginning, still needing love and acceptance and still needing to fulfil those needs through having children.In the end we are the same collection of cells, the same genetic blueprint for life and potential that we were as a fetes, a fetes that Avivas mother describes as 'just a tumour'. The same human fetus that is somehow imagined by Christians to be a unique human soul (even those that 'lack fingers and toes, brains and hearts') and yet has its uniqueness defined by a power of choice it does not yet have, if it ever will.The acting is superb throughout, with all the actresses playing Aviva performing admirably and a couple excelling.The DVD lacks extras, but is certainly worth purchasing as it is a film that deserves many viewings and that repays careful study. It does come with a detailed and informative interview with Director/Writer Tod Solondz.",5,Nature gave us no right to choose.,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,2802,"['Once', 'again', 'Tod', 'Solondz', 'film', 'liberal', 'moral', 'complacencies', 'providing', 'experience', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'touching', 'case', 'deeply', 'philosophical', 'surface', 'examination', 'abortion', 'debate', 'fact', 'Solondz', 'fanatically', 'held', 'yet', 'muddled', 'convictions', 'proponents', 'sides', 'means', 'explore', 'deeper', 'questions', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'can', 'find', 'meaning', 'liberal', 'pro-choicers', 'Christian', 'pro-lifers', 'share', 'conviction', 'human', 'individuals', 'have', 'power', 'choose', 'who', 'be', 'how', 'act.For', 'Christian', 'individuals', 'have', 'power', 'choose', 'good', 'evil', 'God', 'granted', 'power', 'define', 'very', 'souls', 'be', 'granted', 'everlasting', 'heaven', 'hell', 'Homosexuals', 'can', 'be', ""'saved"", 'Even', 'paedophiles', 'character', 'Earl', 'can', 'be', 'born', 'liberal', 'other', 'hand', 'only', 'thing', 'constraining', 'choice', 'unfavourable', 'power', 'relationships', 'Society', 'may', 'determine', 'choices', 'women', 'want', 'make', 'i.e', 'wishing', 'have', 'children', 'deny', 'choice', 'all.Solondz', 'journey', 'Aviva', 'darkly', 'grim', 'fairytale', 'different', 'kind', 'truth', 'human', 'nature', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'might', 'get', 'facelift', 'lose', 'weight', 'spend', 'dollars', 'breast', 'enlargement', 'other', 'words', 'change', 'appearance', 'gain', 'acceptance', 'society', 'always', 'stay', 'same', 'need', 'believe', 'free', 'will', 'ability', 'change', 'control', 'destiny', 'fundamental', 'almost', 'creeds', 'dogmas', 'indeed', 'American', 'political', 'spectrum', 'essential', 'notions', 'morality', 'praise', 'blame', 'reward', 'punishment', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'may', 'become.But', 'free', 'will', 'end', 'finish', 'up', 'same', 'people', 'were', 'beginning', 'many', 'weird', 'experiences', 'end', 'journey', 'Aviva', 'lot', 'older', 'wiser', 'still', 'same', 'child', 'was', 'beginning', 'still', 'needing', 'love', 'acceptance', 'still', 'needing', 'fulfil', 'needs', 'having', 'children.In', 'end', 'are', 'same', 'collection', 'cells', 'same', 'genetic', 'blueprint', 'life', 'potential', 'were', 'fetes', 'fetes', 'Avivas', 'mother', 'tumour', 'same', 'human', 'fetus', 'somehow', 'imagined', 'Christians', 'be', 'unique', 'human', 'soul', 'even', ""'lack"", 'fingers', 'toes', 'brains', 'hearts', 'yet', 'uniqueness', 'defined', 'power', 'choice', 'not', 'yet', 'have', 'ever', 'will.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Aviva', 'performing', 'admirably', 'couple', 'excelling.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'certainly', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'film', 'many', 'viewings', 'careful', 'study', 'come', 'detailed', 'informative', 'interview', 'Director/Writer', 'Tod', 'Solondz']",Palindromes
918533,A6DOCZ10B7JAJ,B000A1IOGG,"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[1, 2]","Most parents cherish the idea of someday becoming grandparents.  But usually not when their daughter is only 13 years old!  Director Todd Solondz(Happiness, Welcome to the Dollhouse, Storytelling) once again grabs taboo around the neck and chokes out all our expectations.This is a demented tale about the destruction of innocence.  A young girl named Aviva has one big dream--have a baby any way possible.  She falls just short of holding up a big sign on the corner saying ""PLEASE KNOCK ME UP!"".  Her parents understandably try to dissuade her efforts, so she runs away.  Needless to say her trip will evoke all kinds of reactions.The character Aviva is played by seven or eight different girls, all of them unique--differing in age, size, and race.  This is an odd element to the story, since Aviva's appearance changes frequently.  This could have been done to illustrate different emotions or attitudes in the young girl.  But really I think it points out that the actual character doesn't really matter, it could be the story of any young girl.Another interesting point the movie makes is the idea that people don't really ever change.  Despite your weight, age, financial status, plastic surgery, sex change, whatever...you are essentially the same person no matter what.  We are robots programmed arbitrarily by nature's genetic code.  I found that an interesting point, but hopefully there is no truth to that.I strongly recommend that you check out any of Todd Solondz work.  This movie pretty much ends where Welcome to the Dollhouse leaves off, but is not important to watch it first.  All of Todd's films may seem brash and provocative, but underneath the surface they all harness an unbridled sense of compassion and sensitivity.

918534,A3U7E2BOFLD3VM,B000A1IOGG,cherubino,"[6, 6]","The other reviewers have written generously on this movie, so I will just add a few of my own thoughts:Aviva is a girl bound to failure and misery at every turn.  Her first time (or, so we think) is with a semi-misanthropic young man who clumsily inseminates her.  The resulting pregnancy drives her unhappy mother to drag her to get an abortion, which ends with the doctor revealing that a hysterectomy had to be performed.  To add to the tragedy, the cowardly parents lie to her, and say she is just fine.  With her deep desire for children, Aviva continues trying to get pregnant, not knowing that it's all in vain.  The kicker is that the sex act itself isn't even worth it, since she winds up with losers like the Joe/Earl/Bob character, a dumpy man who couldn't get a date with a real woman to save his life.Not all of the Avivas get an equal turn at bat.  The Aviva who gets an abortion enjoys plenty of camera time, while the Huckleberry Aviva gets just a brief scene with no lines.Some reviewers say that the Mama Sunshine sequence tips the abortion argument in favor of the pro-life movement. If we just met and heard Mama Sunshine, maybe this would be a valid point.  The ugly part comes when the loser Earl, Mama Sunshine's husband Beau, and Dr. Dan are in the basement.  Dr. Dan, who examined Aviva without her consent when she was out cold, reveals her to be a ""child whore."" Beau declares that he has never had a ""slut"" in his house before.  Little do they know that Aviva is hiding out in the basement, listening to their every word.  Suddenly, her momentary sense of respite and belonging is shattered, because of a couple of comments by some bigoted, patriarchal extremists.  Even as she gets ready to run away, she says goodbye to a boy who whispers ""harlot"" in his sleep.The point that I'm trying to make is that as much of a selfish you-know-what that Aviva's mother is, the Sunshine clan is more sinister, hiding their ugly prejudices behind a veneer of happiness and acceptance.The rest of the movie finds Aviva constantly being used, let down, lectured to, and deceived.  She runs into Judah again, the boy who impregnated her, and now calls himself Otto.  After a drive in the woods, he has sex with her, and ruins the act by cursing his premature ejaculation.  Aviva morphs into different versions of herself during the sex act, and afterwards becomes the little black girl from the beginning, who breaks your heart by uttering a positive, self-affirmating statement.",4,You want some Nerds?,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,2493,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'generously', 'movie', 'will', 'just', 'add', 'few', 'own', 'thoughts', 'Aviva', 'girl', 'bound', 'failure', 'misery', 'turn', 'first', 'time', 'think', 'semi-misanthropic', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'clumsily', 'resulting', 'pregnancy', 'unhappy', 'mother', 'drag', 'get', 'abortion', 'doctor', 'revealing', 'hysterectomy', 'had', 'be', 'performed', 'add', 'tragedy', 'cowardly', 'parents', 'lie', 'say', 'just', 'fine', 'deep', 'desire', 'children', 'Aviva', 'trying', 'get', 'pregnant', 'not', 'knowing', 'vain', 'kicker', 'sex', 'act', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'up', 'losers', 'Joe/Earl/Bob', 'character', 'dumpy', 'man', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'date', 'real', 'woman', 'save', 'life.Not', 'Avivas', 'get', 'equal', 'turn', 'bat', 'Aviva', 'who', 'abortion', 'plenty', 'camera', 'time', 'Huckleberry', 'Aviva', 'just', 'brief', 'scene', 'lines.Some', 'reviewers', 'say', 'Mama', 'Sunshine', 'sequence', 'abortion', 'argument', 'favor', 'pro-life', 'movement', 'just', 'met', 'heard', 'Mama', 'Sunshine', 'maybe', 'would', 'be', 'valid', 'point', 'ugly', 'part', 'when', 'loser', 'Earl', 'Mama', 'Sunshine', 'husband', 'Beau', 'Dr.', 'Dan', 'are', 'basement', 'Dr.', 'Dan', 'who', 'examined', 'Aviva', 'consent', 'when', 'was', 'out', 'cold', 'be', 'child', 'whore', 'Beau', 'never', 'had', 'slut', 'house', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'Aviva', 'hiding', 'out', 'basement', 'listening', 'word', 'Suddenly', 'momentary', 'sense', 'respite', 'belonging', 'shattered', 'couple', 'comments', 'bigoted', 'patriarchal', 'extremists', 'Even', 'ready', 'run', 'away', 'goodbye', 'boy', 'who', 'harlot', 'sleep.The', 'point', ""'m"", 'trying', 'make', 'as', 'much', 'selfish', 'you-know-what', 'Aviva', 'mother', 'Sunshine', 'clan', 'more', 'sinister', 'hiding', 'ugly', 'prejudices', 'veneer', 'happiness', 'acceptance.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'Aviva', 'constantly', 'being', 'used', 'let', 'down', 'lectured', 'deceived', 'Judah', 'again', 'boy', 'who', 'impregnated', 'now', 'Otto', 'drive', 'woods', 'sex', 'act', 'cursing', 'premature', 'ejaculation', 'Aviva', 'morphs', 'different', 'versions', 'herself', 'sex', 'act', 'afterwards', 'little', 'black', 'girl', 'beginning', 'who', 'heart', 'uttering', 'positive', 'self-affirmating', 'statement']",Palindromes

She is the only daughter of the loving parents but she is not happy and the only thing she passionately wants - to become a mother and to have a lot of babies. She gets pregnant at 13 and forced by her mother goes through an abortion. As the result of the procedure gone wrong, she will never be pregnant again. Aviva runs from home and enters the world populated by very strange, often dangerous but always multi-layered characters. What makes this movie rather unusual, Solondz chose eight different actresses (in age, color, and shape) to play Aviva. The writer/director explains the experiment by his desire to make as many women and girls as possible identify themselves with the girl in the search for love and understanding. Aviva is not a real girl, really, she is an archetype of a woman who longs for love and tenderness and who is absolutely innocent in her search for them, often in the wrong places with the wrong strangers.As for the title, -- a palindrome is a word, phrase, verse, or sentence that reads the same backward or forward. In the way, it is a metaphor for life. The word dies just after been born when it reads letter by letter backwards. It is self destruction. The same applies to Aviva (her name is a palindrome, BTW) - she and the world around her are static, she is in the vicious circle and she can't break it. You can not move on if you just walk in circles. Even if it seems that the world around Aviva and she always change (that's why she's got so many different faces), she is still the same - no matter if she is a little girl, an awkward teenager, a heavy black woman or frightfully youthful Jennifer Jason Leigh.Even though, I respect Solontz's decision to tell the parable rather than the story of one particular girl, I think that choosing eight actresses was one of the ""Palindromes'"" weaknesses. The idea was interesting but not all of the performers were up to the task and the constant switching of the actresses was rather distracting.I admire Solondz for his fierce uncompromising bravery - he knows that his films will never be the crowd pleasers - but he keeps making them.. I am not sure if I like ""Palindromes"" but I keep thinking about it, and I know I would - for long time.",3,A Girl With Many Faces In The Search For Love and Understanding,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,2310,"['13', 'years', 'old', 'Aviva', 'Victor', 'heroine', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'film', 'Palindromes', 'only', 'daughter', 'loving', 'parents', 'not', 'happy', 'only', 'thing', 'passionately', 'become', 'mother', 'have', 'lot', 'babies', 'pregnant', '13', 'forced', 'mother', 'abortion', 'result', 'procedure', 'gone', 'wrong', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'pregnant', 'again', 'Aviva', 'home', 'world', 'populated', 'very', 'strange', 'often', 'dangerous', 'always', 'multi-layered', 'characters', 'What', 'movie', 'rather', 'unusual', 'Solondz', 'chose', 'eight', 'different', 'actresses', 'age', 'color', 'shape', 'play', 'Aviva', 'writer/director', 'experiment', 'desire', 'make', 'many', 'women', 'girls', 'possible', 'identify', 'girl', 'search', 'love', 'understanding', 'Aviva', 'not', 'real', 'girl', 'really', 'archetype', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'tenderness', 'who', 'absolutely', 'innocent', 'search', 'often', 'wrong', 'places', 'wrong', 'strangers.As', 'title', 'palindrome', 'word', 'phrase', 'verse', 'sentence', 'same', 'backward', 'forward', 'way', 'metaphor', 'life', 'word', 'just', 'been', 'born', 'when', 'letter', 'letter', 'backwards', 'self', 'destruction', 'same', 'applies', 'Aviva', 'name', 'palindrome', 'BTW', 'world', 'are', 'static', 'vicious', 'circle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'break', 'can', 'not', 'move', 'just', 'walk', 'circles', 'Even', 'world', 'Aviva', 'always', 'change', 'why', 'got', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'still', 'same', 'matter', 'little', 'girl', 'awkward', 'teenager', 'heavy', 'black', 'woman', 'frightfully', 'youthful', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh.Even', 'respect', 'Solontz', 'decision', 'tell', 'parable', 'rather', 'story', 'one', 'particular', 'girl', 'think', 'choosing', 'eight', 'actresses', 'was', 'one', 'Palindromes', 'weaknesses', 'idea', 'was', 'interesting', 'not', 'performers', 'were', 'up', 'task', 'constant', 'switching', 'actresses', 'was', 'rather', 'distracting.I', 'admire', 'Solondz', 'fierce', 'uncompromising', 'bravery', 'films', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'crowd', 'pleasers', 'making', 'them..', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'like', 'Palindromes', 'keep', 'thinking', 'know', 'would', 'long', 'time']",Palindromes

Several characters from Dollhouse are featured and many references are made to events in said previous movie. It's best to be familiar with Dollhouse first before watching Palindromes.Dawn Weiner, our lovely protagonist from Dollhouse, is dead. She committed suicide after getting pregnant from a date-rape. And even in death people cannot hold back on talking trash about her. Her 12-year-old cousin Aviva (she IS 12, a lot of people are mentioning various ages, she only turns 13 at the end) is so affecting by her tragic life that she vows to never turn out like her.Her mum (Ellen Barkin who appears to have had some dodgy face-lift) promises that will never happen as she loves Aviva more than Dawn's family loved her. Which could not be further than the truth. As soon as she becomes pregnant to some horny boy Aviva's mum shows her true colors. She is selfish, ignorant and downright cruel. Her dad also. They may well be angry but that's no excuse for the pressure they put her under.Aviva is forced into having an abortion. But it goes wrong and she ends up having an emergency hysterectomy. Thinking only of the effect it has upon herself, Aviva's mum keeps this part secret from her. Obviously devastated at the lost of her unborn child, Aviva takes off on a journey to find a new lover and make a new baby, unaware that she never will.Upon this journey Aviva is played by many different actresses, all of whom portray her with the same facial expressions and mannerisms. She meets a variety of characters, including her cousin Mark (Dawn's older brother), a trucker who isn't a pedo but loves her anyway and family of disabled Jesus loving Christians who secretly fund abortionist assassinations.It's bizarre and sometimes outrageous journey full of some typical Todd Solondz moments; scenes where the far-fetched becomes very believable because human-nature often stretches beyond normality when no one is looking. It was sad to see that Mark Weiner's life ruined in the way that it is. But he came through as a more mature and sympathetic character than the bully older brother he was before. And he did have some good scenes.Now, about the whole pre-teen sexuality thing. I do not have a problem with this but I know a lot of people do. I don't find anything offensive about it but this is the third time Solondz has tackled the subject. Is he into it? Is he against it? Does he find it humorous? Or does he just use it as an easy way to rile us up and make us react?

""A New Yorker""","[12, 15]","Recommended to me by my dark, mysterious, and intellectual friend Chris Blackshere, I still found myself shivering of the affects of this film. I found the characters to be deeply emotional, at times disturbing yet oddly enough neither attractive nor repulsive. If you were offended by ""The Woodsman""...then seeing this film would not be advised. ""The Woodsman"" largely hinted at things...and seldom ""went there."" This film not only ""goes there,"" but on a certain level normalizes it. I sincerely doubt any abuse survivor with unresolved issues could see this film without becoming upset. Likewise, I doubt that any person with a physical challenge/disability could see this film without being irritated...both of these things are sad, in my eyes, because what Solondz does really well is not judge the process...he presents his characters in an every day way because they are part of everyday life.All of these characters are deeply human...wounded souls...some do wonderful things for selfish reasons, some do horrible things for noble reasons...others seem to merely survive. There are a number of standout performances, and there are other performances where you look at the screen and are trying to figure out ""Is that on purpose?"" For example, the opening ""Aviva"" is a young African-American actress of probably 9 or 10...quite honestly, she's a rather horrid actress who appears to be reading lines off the cue card...while she looks adorable...well, her delivery was simply awkward...and yet, as time went on, I found this characterization balancing wonderfully with the others...perhaps the most powerful portrayal is offered by the ""Mama Sunshine"" Aviva...portrayed by Sharon Wilkins, a large African-American female...older, and clearly not a child...clearly not innocent...yet the whole scene is played off as though she is AND Wilkins is mesmerizing. Likewise, the wondrous Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Aviva after she has returned home and adds a weathered, yet tender touch to the character that is just hypnotic. Additionally, her insistence to invite a family member who is alleged to be a pedophile leads to one of the most quietly powerful conversations I've seen on film this year ending with these classic lines:Mark Wiener: By the way, I'm not a pedophile.Aviva: I know. Pedophiles LOVE children.Simply powerful.""Palindromes"" is a challenging film...it is, at times, a tad boring and has definite pockets where the acting is not up to par. Yet, in reality, I can't help but feel this was an intentional move by Solondz. It's as if he wants us to realize...that we can change our looks, our voices, our boobs, our bodies, our talents, our gifts, our color...but who we are doesn't change. Selfish people will always be selfish...happy people will always find a way to be happy. Challenging, thought provoking and deeply human...Todd Solondz, backward and forward, is simply an outstanding, courageous storyteller and a unique, insightful and gifted director.",4,"If you do not like asking yourself difficult questions, perhaps this film is not for you",1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,2977,"['Recommended', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'intellectual', 'friend', 'Chris', 'Blackshere', 'still', 'found', 'shivering', 'affects', 'film', 'found', 'characters', 'be', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'times', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'oddly', 'enough', 'attractive', 'repulsive', 'were', 'offended', 'Woodsman', 'then', 'seeing', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'advised', 'Woodsman', 'largely', 'hinted', 'things', 'seldom', 'went', 'there', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'there', 'certain', 'level', 'sincerely', 'doubt', 'abuse', 'survivor', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'could', 'see', 'film', 'becoming', 'upset', 'Likewise', 'doubt', 'person', 'physical', 'challenge/disability', 'could', 'see', 'film', 'being', 'irritated', 'things', 'are', 'sad', 'eyes', 'what', 'Solondz', 'really', 'well', 'not', 'judge', 'process', 'characters', 'day', 'way', 'are', 'part', 'everyday', 'life.All', 'characters', 'are', 'deeply', 'human', 'wounded', 'souls', 'do', 'wonderful', 'things', 'selfish', 'reasons', 'do', 'horrible', 'things', 'noble', 'reasons', 'others', 'seem', 'merely', 'survive', 'are', 'number', 'standout', 'performances', 'are', 'other', 'performances', 'where', 'look', 'screen', 'are', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'purpose', 'example', 'opening', 'Aviva', 'young', 'African-American', 'actress', 'probably', '9', '10', 'quite', 'honestly', 'rather', 'horrid', 'actress', 'who', 'be', 'reading', 'lines', 'cue', 'card', 'adorable', 'well', 'delivery', 'was', 'simply', 'awkward', 'yet', 'time', 'went', 'found', 'characterization', 'balancing', 'wonderfully', 'others', 'perhaps', 'most', 'powerful', 'portrayal', 'offered', 'Mama', 'Sunshine', 'Aviva', 'portrayed', 'Sharon', 'Wilkins', 'large', 'African-American', 'female', 'older', 'clearly', 'not', 'child', 'clearly', 'not', 'innocent', 'yet', 'whole', 'scene', 'played', 'off', 'AND', 'Wilkins', 'mesmerizing', 'Likewise', 'wondrous', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Aviva', 'returned', 'home', 'weathered', 'yet', 'tender', 'touch', 'character', 'just', 'hypnotic', 'Additionally', 'insistence', 'invite', 'family', 'member', 'who', 'alleged', 'be', 'pedophile', 'one', 'most', 'quietly', 'powerful', 'conversations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'year', 'ending', 'classic', 'lines', 'Mark', 'Wiener', 'way', ""'m"", 'not', 'pedophile.Aviva', 'know', 'Pedophiles', 'LOVE', 'children.Simply', 'powerful', 'Palindromes', 'challenging', 'film', 'times', 'tad', 'boring', 'definite', 'pockets', 'where', 'acting', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'reality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'was', 'intentional', 'move', 'Solondz', 'realize', 'can', 'change', 'looks', 'voices', 'boobs', 'bodies', 'talents', 'gifts', 'color', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'change', 'Selfish', 'people', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'selfish', 'happy', 'people', 'will', 'always', 'find', 'way', 'be', 'happy', 'Challenging', 'thought', 'provoking', 'deeply', 'human', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'backward', 'forward', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'courageous', 'storyteller', 'unique', 'insightful', 'gifted', 'director']",Palindromes
918540,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000A1IOGG,K. Driscoll,"[7, 8]","Todd Solondz (Happiness,Storytelling) is one of the most unique filmmakers of the last few decades and for my money, one of the most creative as well.  He places American suburbia in the ugliest frame possible but manages to find some very dark humor within all the twisted sadness he portrays.  He takes people we normally don't want to know and examines them intimately enough that we must chose wether we like them or hate them more than we could ever imagine.  His latest film was 2004's Palindromes, and it is no exception to his style.  Solondz does more of the same but it almost seems that with Palindromes he wanted to explore his themes and style with even more depth.  Some viewers may think this means Palindromes is likely to be more disturbing, but really it is his style and his unrestrained creative madness that is more on display than the kind of content within his films that often justify his troubling reputation.  Although, like Happiness, Solondz explores child molestation and sexual deviance further than anyone, and many will not want to join him on this ride.Aviva (played by 8 different actors, including Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a thirteen year old girl that is profoundly sad and who has only one motivation in her life.  She wishes to have a child so she may be loved by someone for the rest of her life.  She decides that in order to have a child she will have sex with an unsavory family friend named Judah.  Aviva's mother (Ellen Barkin) is devastated to find that Aviva is pregnant and orders her to get an abortion.  The doctor informs Aviva's parents that she is no longer capable of having children after the procedure, but her parents never actually inform Aviva of this complication.  She soon runs away from home to continue her quest to have a child.  She has sex with a pedofile truck driver who then abandons her.  Aviva's travels then bring her to a Christian fundamentalist group who cares for misfits kids without a home.  The head of this group is also involved in organizing the assassinations of doctors at abortion clinics, and one of his associates is the same pedofile truck driver who Aviva had relations with earlier in the film.  She is of course drawn to him again.  The truck driver, whose name is eventually revealed to be Bob, despite his constant need to use aliases and try to change what he is and what he is perceived as, is assigned to kill the doctor who completed Aviva's procedure.  Aviva goes with him and Bob accidently murders the doctor's young daughter in addition to killing the doctor.  He feels terrible for this and expresses how stupid it was for him to think that actions like that could change what he is.  By the film's end Aviva reunites with Judah, who now calls him self Otto. She has sex with him again, completely oblivious to the fact that she cannot have a child.There are a few different reasons I think Solondz decided to use seven actresses and one young actor to portray Aviva.  For one, the obvious stand against convention is a Solondz trademark. The diversity of the group that plays Aviva is also wide and perhaps more provoking for that alone.  So each actor was probably cast without regard for visuals and more for their performance in their particular scenes.  The primary reason I think Solondz did this though was to show that no matter what you look like on the outside you can't change what you are. Aviva will always be Aviva no matter what she looks like on the surface.  Even if you spell her name backwards she will always be Aviva and Aviva will always want a child to call her mom.",4,As Provoking as it is Disturbing,1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,3591,"['Todd', 'Solondz', 'Happiness', 'Storytelling', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'filmmakers', 'last', 'few', 'decades', 'money', 'one', 'most', 'creative', 'as', 'well', 'American', 'suburbia', 'ugliest', 'frame', 'possible', 'find', 'very', 'dark', 'humor', 'twisted', 'sadness', 'people', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'examines', 'intimately', 'must', 'chose', 'like', 'hate', 'more', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'latest', 'film', 'was', '2004', 'Palindromes', 'exception', 'style', 'Solondz', 'more', 'same', 'almost', 'Palindromes', 'wanted', 'explore', 'themes', 'style', 'even', 'more', 'depth', 'viewers', 'may', 'think', 'Palindromes', 'likely', 'be', 'more', 'disturbing', 'really', 'style', 'unrestrained', 'creative', 'madness', 'more', 'display', 'kind', 'content', 'films', 'often', 'troubling', 'reputation', 'Happiness', 'Solondz', 'child', 'molestation', 'sexual', 'deviance', 'further', 'anyone', 'many', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'join', 'ride.Aviva', 'played', '8', 'different', 'actors', 'including', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'profoundly', 'sad', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'motivation', 'life', 'have', 'child', 'may', 'be', 'loved', 'someone', 'rest', 'life', 'order', 'have', 'child', 'will', 'have', 'sex', 'unsavory', 'family', 'friend', 'named', 'Judah', 'Aviva', 'mother', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'devastated', 'find', 'Aviva', 'pregnant', 'orders', 'get', 'abortion', 'doctor', 'Aviva', 'parents', 'no', 'longer', 'capable', 'having', 'children', 'procedure', 'parents', 'never', 'actually', 'inform', 'Aviva', 'complication', 'soon', 'away', 'home', 'continue', 'quest', 'have', 'child', 'sex', 'pedofile', 'truck', 'driver', 'who', 'then', 'Aviva', 'travels', 'then', 'bring', 'Christian', 'fundamentalist', 'group', 'who', 'misfits', 'kids', 'home', 'head', 'group', 'also', 'involved', 'organizing', 'assassinations', 'doctors', 'abortion', 'clinics', 'one', 'associates', 'same', 'pedofile', 'truck', 'driver', 'who', 'Aviva', 'had', 'relations', 'earlier', 'film', 'course', 'drawn', 'again', 'truck', 'driver', 'name', 'eventually', 'revealed', 'be', 'Bob', 'constant', 'need', 'use', 'aliases', 'try', 'change', 'what', 'what', 'perceived', 'assigned', 'kill', 'doctor', 'who', 'completed', 'Aviva', 'procedure', 'Aviva', 'Bob', 'accidently', 'doctor', 'young', 'daughter', 'addition', 'killing', 'doctor', 'terrible', 'how', 'stupid', 'was', 'think', 'actions', 'could', 'change', 'what', 'film', 'end', 'Aviva', 'Judah', 'who', 'now', 'Otto', 'sex', 'again', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'child.There', 'are', 'few', 'different', 'reasons', 'think', 'Solondz', 'decided', 'use', 'seven', 'actresses', 'one', 'young', 'actor', 'portray', 'Aviva', 'one', 'obvious', 'stand', 'convention', 'Solondz', 'trademark', 'diversity', 'group', 'Aviva', 'also', 'wide', 'perhaps', 'more', 'provoking', 'alone', 'actor', 'was', 'probably', 'cast', 'regard', 'visuals', 'more', 'performance', 'particular', 'scenes', 'primary', 'reason', 'think', 'Solondz', 'did', 'though', 'was', 'show', 'matter', 'what', 'look', 'outside', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'what', 'are', 'Aviva', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Aviva', 'matter', 'what', 'surface', 'Even', 'spell', 'name', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Aviva', 'Aviva', 'will', 'always', 'want', 'child', 'call', 'mom']",Palindromes

918543,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000A1IOGG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","""Palindrome"" is a provocative film, not because of its subject matter, but because of writer-director Todd Solondz's conceit.  The story is about Aviva, a 12-year-old girl, who becomes pregnant.  The conceit is that Aviva is played by eight different people, one of who is male, one of whom is a lot younger than 12, and one of whom is obviously a lot older since she is played by Jennifer Jason Lee.  Some of the Avivas are white and some are black.  By playing with the variables of age, race, gender, and even body type, Solondz forces viewers to ask themselves what different they make in our feelings towards the character.  If a grown woman gets pregnant the human calculus is decided different than if it is a little girl gets pregnant, and Solondz blatantly throws these variables into the face of his viewers.  He assumes that your sympathies change as he alters the variables, and ultimately the big question is what makes them change and how much?Given this sort of psychological assault by Solodnz it is probably not surprising that I was drawn to the Aviva who said nothing.  But I was also aware that there were a couple of Avivas that I considered to be more ""real"" than others.  I think I have convinced myself because those were the ones that seemed most appropriate to the situation as that of a young girl who fancies the idea of having a baby the way she would have thought about playing with dolls only a few years earlier.  Of course, judging the different Avivas by a personal standard is exactly the inevitable response to this 2004 film that Solondz expects, and that invites self-examination as to why you are thinking what you are thinking.  This is obviously not a film designed to make you comfortable, which is certainly something I can support, but in the end I am not sure what we do once we recognize our peculiar responses.  Being aware that the fact we judge human beings by such variables does not stop us from continuing to do so.  Then again, since these are hard questions there is no reason to expect anything close to easy answers, and more than a few viewers will simply not want to play this little game.I have to add that I really did not think that ""Palindrome"" was a film about abortion.  If you are talking about a young girl becoming pregnant I would think abortion is an inevitable part of the discussion that follows, whether it is immediately embraced or instantly rejected.  On this score it seems to me that Solondz is pretty even handed, since I was as offended by Joyce's attempts to cajole her daughter into having one as I was by Peter Paul finding aborted fetuses to show her in the dump.  I read what happens at the end with Joe/Earl/Bob in New Jersey at the end of the film as being more about what is essentially a botched abortion rather than for the idea of abortion, but I fully understand that others will see that as being on point with regards to that topic.  That divergent opinion simply speaks to how ""Palindrome"" is a cinematic Rorschach test and that beyond provoking his audience Solondz does not have a specific agenda.",4,A provocative film about the differences that differences make,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,3093,"['Palindrome', 'provocative', 'film', 'not', 'subject', 'matter', 'writer-director', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'conceit', 'story', 'Aviva', '12-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'pregnant', 'conceit', 'Aviva', 'played', 'eight', 'different', 'people', 'one', 'who', 'male', 'one', 'whom', 'lot', 'younger', '12', 'one', 'whom', 'obviously', 'lot', 'older', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Avivas', 'are', 'white', 'are', 'black', 'playing', 'variables', 'age', 'race', 'gender', 'even', 'body', 'type', 'Solondz', 'viewers', 'ask', 'what', 'different', 'make', 'feelings', 'character', 'grown', 'woman', 'pregnant', 'human', 'calculus', 'decided', 'different', 'little', 'girl', 'pregnant', 'Solondz', 'blatantly', 'variables', 'face', 'viewers', 'sympathies', 'change', 'variables', 'ultimately', 'big', 'question', 'what', 'change', 'how', 'much', 'Given', 'sort', 'psychological', 'assault', 'Solodnz', 'probably', 'not', 'surprising', 'was', 'drawn', 'Aviva', 'who', 'said', 'nothing', 'was', 'also', 'aware', 'were', 'couple', 'Avivas', 'considered', 'be', 'more', 'real', 'others', 'think', 'have', 'convinced', 'were', 'ones', 'seemed', 'most', 'appropriate', 'situation', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'idea', 'having', 'baby', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'playing', 'dolls', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'course', 'judging', 'different', 'Avivas', 'personal', 'standard', 'exactly', 'inevitable', 'response', '2004', 'film', 'Solondz', 'self-examination', 'why', 'are', 'thinking', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'obviously', 'not', 'film', 'designed', 'make', 'comfortable', 'certainly', 'something', 'can', 'support', 'end', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'once', 'recognize', 'peculiar', 'responses', 'Being', 'aware', 'fact', 'judge', 'human', 'beings', 'such', 'variables', 'not', 'stop', 'continuing', 'do', 'so', 'Then', 'again', 'are', 'hard', 'questions', 'reason', 'expect', 'anything', 'close', 'easy', 'answers', 'more', 'few', 'viewers', 'will', 'simply', 'not', 'want', 'play', 'little', 'game.I', 'have', 'add', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'Palindrome', 'was', 'film', 'abortion', 'are', 'talking', 'young', 'girl', 'becoming', 'pregnant', 'would', 'think', 'abortion', 'inevitable', 'part', 'discussion', 'immediately', 'embraced', 'instantly', 'rejected', 'score', 'Solondz', 'pretty', 'even', 'handed', 'was', 'offended', 'Joyce', 'attempts', 'cajole', 'daughter', 'having', 'one', 'was', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'finding', 'aborted', 'fetuses', 'show', 'dump', 'read', 'what', 'end', 'Joe/Earl/Bob', 'New', 'Jersey', 'end', 'film', 'being', 'more', 'what', 'essentially', 'botched', 'abortion', 'rather', 'idea', 'abortion', 'fully', 'understand', 'others', 'will', 'see', 'as', 'being', 'point', 'regards', 'topic', 'divergent', 'opinion', 'simply', 'how', 'Palindrome', 'cinematic', 'Rorschach', 'test', 'provoking', 'audience', 'Solondz', 'not', 'have', 'specific', 'agenda']",Palindromes

The story is about a girl named Aviva who, in spite of her emotionally flat-lined spirit, desperately wants to get pregnant.  She wants the unconditional love of another person, viewing a child like a sort of soul-transfusion.  Maybe the dependence and adoration of a baby will give life meaning, or comfort, or make her a person of worth.  In any case, it's clear that the ticks of her biological clock don't inform her decision: she's 13.Her parents (Richard Masur and Ellen Barkin in complex, love-em-hate-em roles) are perturbed by her decision, and they do what they can to stop her, but, like many teenage girls, Aviva is a willful sort, and she ends up running away from home, setting off on a spiritual journey of self-discovery.  Yeah, that's right.  I just wrote ""a spiritual journey of self-discovery.""In the course of her travels, Aviva meets pedophilic truck drivers, militant anti-abortionists, and a Christian singing group composed of handicapped and lethally cheerful children.  It's a tableau of Solondz's usual mordancy, off-putting quirkiness directed with a half-shrug of innocence.  In mid-journey, Aviva comes across a river, on the banks of which leans a fanciful children's boat, a large plastic toy that looks like it was designed by Playskool.  Dusk bleeds out over the horizon as she climbs aboard, expressionless, and drifts out over the unruffled currents.  It's a bittersweet symbol of poignance that pretends to be ironic.In a way, that symbol represents everything about ""Palindromes"" that works (and the few things that don't).  Solondz's films usually operate like harsh mental exercises that force audiences to make tough decisions (like a mother being asked, ""If you only had enough time to save one of your children from a burning building, which one would it be?"").  This film is far less hands-on.  Aviva is portrayed by eight different actors and actresses, removing the physical element from the equation, forcing the audience to think less about Aviva and more about what she represents.  Even Aviva's personality is so muted, it's hard to imagine her as anything more than the yen of all people who feel like something is missing inside of them.Still.  Even though the movie deals with child molestation, the horrors of both abortion and anti-abortionists, unconditional love versus radical spiritualism, ""Palindromes"" makes very few decisions, and Aviva never really changes much.  The title, the names of the key characters, the story arc, the movie's central point: it all reads the same backwards and forwards.  And though it's clever, it's also a little self-inflated.  Like a snake eating it's own tail, or a really, really intense Buddhist, this movie almost disappears straight into its own navel.Although it delves into some fanciful mushiness, it's easy to respect its steadfast refusal to do anything else.  In any other case, the flick could be pigeonholed into a pro-life or pro-choice camp.  Like all of Solondz's other works, this movie doesn't operate under a banner you could wave with abandon on Pennsylvania Avenue.  I have the urge to give it a label (pro-people? anti-regret?), but its far too slippery for that, and that, in the end, makes it a movie worth watching.  In spite of a few pointless scenes (the party with Jennifer Jason Leigh, where Solondz almost tatoos his central thesis across the screen), ""Palindromes"" does quite well what it wants to.  It prompts consideration, debate, and buries (in even the serest of minds) the seeds of thought.  It may not be Solondz's most powerful film, but it is his most soulful.",4,Eros Saw Aviva Was Sore,1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,4170,"['Solondz', 'known', 'making', 'tough', 'unpopular', 'choices.Happinessand', 'first', 'half', 'ofStorytelling', 'specifically', 'are', 'mind-rapes', 'so', 'soulfully', 'brutal', 'easy', 'wonder', 'guy', ""n't"", 'just', 'shocking', 'shock', 'sake.His', 'films', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'pills', 'swallow', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'medicinal', 'points', 'fact', 'are', 'surface-level', 'simplicity', 'easy', 'miss', 'scripts', 'do', ""n't"", 'wink', 'smirk', 'audience', 'stare', 'straight', 'back', 'bloodshot', 'unblinking', 'eyes', 'Palindromes', 'Solondz', 'bravado', 'written', 'story', 'girl', 'named', 'Aviva', 'who', 'spite', 'emotionally', 'flat-lined', 'spirit', 'desperately', 'get', 'pregnant', 'unconditional', 'love', 'person', 'viewing', 'child', 'sort', 'soul-transfusion', 'Maybe', 'dependence', 'adoration', 'baby', 'will', 'give', 'life', 'meaning', 'comfort', 'make', 'person', 'worth', 'case', 'clear', 'ticks', 'biological', 'clock', 'do', ""n't"", 'inform', 'decision', '13.Her', 'parents', 'Richard', 'Masur', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'complex', 'love-em-hate-em', 'roles', 'are', 'perturbed', 'decision', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'stop', 'many', 'teenage', 'girls', 'Aviva', 'willful', 'sort', 'up', 'running', 'away', 'home', 'setting', 'off', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'Yeah', 'right', 'just', 'wrote', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'course', 'travels', 'Aviva', 'pedophilic', 'truck', 'drivers', 'militant', 'anti-abortionists', 'Christian', 'singing', 'group', 'composed', 'handicapped', 'lethally', 'cheerful', 'children', 'tableau', 'Solondz', 'usual', 'mordancy', 'off-putting', 'quirkiness', 'directed', 'half-shrug', 'innocence', 'mid-journey', 'Aviva', 'river', 'banks', 'fanciful', 'children', 'boat', 'large', 'plastic', 'toy', 'was', 'designed', 'Playskool', 'Dusk', 'out', 'horizon', 'aboard', 'expressionless', 'drifts', 'out', 'unruffled', 'currents', 'bittersweet', 'symbol', 'poignance', 'be', 'ironic.In', 'way', 'symbol', 'everything', 'Palindromes', 'few', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'Solondz', 'films', 'usually', 'operate', 'harsh', 'mental', 'exercises', 'force', 'audiences', 'make', 'tough', 'decisions', 'mother', 'being', 'asked', 'only', 'had', 'enough', 'time', 'save', 'one', 'children', 'burning', 'building', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'far', 'less', 'hands-on', 'Aviva', 'portrayed', 'eight', 'different', 'actors', 'actresses', 'removing', 'physical', 'element', 'equation', 'forcing', 'audience', 'think', 'less', 'Aviva', 'more', 'what', 'Even', 'Aviva', 'personality', 'so', 'muted', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anything', 'more', 'yen', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'something', 'missing', 'them.Still', 'Even', 'movie', 'deals', 'child', 'molestation', 'horrors', 'abortion', 'anti-abortionists', 'unconditional', 'love', 'versus', 'radical', 'spiritualism', 'Palindromes', 'very', 'few', 'decisions', 'Aviva', 'never', 'really', 'changes', 'much', 'title', 'names', 'key', 'characters', 'story', 'arc', 'movie', 'central', 'point', 'same', 'backwards', 'forwards', 'clever', 'also', 'little', 'self-inflated', 'snake', 'eating', 'own', 'tail', 'really', 'really', 'intense', 'Buddhist', 'movie', 'almost', 'straight', 'own', 'fanciful', 'mushiness', 'easy', 'respect', 'steadfast', 'refusal', 'do', 'anything', 'else', 'other', 'case', 'flick', 'could', 'be', 'pigeonholed', 'pro-life', 'pro-choice', 'camp', 'Solondz', 'other', 'works', 'movie', ""n't"", 'operate', 'banner', 'could', 'wave', 'abandon', 'Pennsylvania', 'Avenue', 'have', 'urge', 'give', 'label', 'pro-people', 'anti-regret', 'far', 'too', 'slippery', 'end', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'spite', 'few', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'party', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'where', 'Solondz', 'almost', 'tatoos', 'central', 'thesis', 'screen', 'Palindromes', 'quite', 'well', 'what', 'consideration', 'debate', 'buries', 'even', 'serest', 'minds', 'seeds', 'thought', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Solondz', 'most', 'powerful', 'film', 'most', 'soulful']",Palindromes

918547,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000A1IOGG,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","""Palindromes"" is writer/director Todd Solondz's latest audacious, satirical journey into bourgeois America. The narratives are becoming more far-fetched and contrived, but somehow without losing their black humor, recognizable characterizations, and watchability. ""Palindromes"" returns to familiar territory. It's main character, Aviva Victor, is the cousin of ""Welcome to the Doll House""'s ultimate middle child Dawn Wiener. Actor Matthew Faber reprises his role as Dawn's brother Mark. Aviva is 13 years old and desperately wants to have a baby. But her blunt, tenacious mother (Ellen Barkin) stands in her way. So Aviva runs away from home where she hopes to get pregnant and have a child undeterred. Instead, she encounters a strange bunch of ideologues whom she could easily have reason to hate or to embrace, as they could her.There are 2 major themes at work in ""Palindromes"". One is an exercise in manipulating audience sympathies. Aviva is played by 8 different actors, including a large black woman and a pubescent boy, in order to draw attention to the role that appearances (age, race, sex) play in audience reaction. Oddly, the changes in Aviva's appearance don't derail the narrative. I quickly got used to it and came to identify Aviva with her mousy, barely audible voice instead of with a particular appearance. The only iva  incarnation that I didn't buy into is the 6-year-old girl, and that was because her manner of speaking was different. I'm not sure what this says about how an audience identifies with a character. Aviva's various appearances were not chosen randomly. They make a certain amount of sense. But it amazes me that Todd Solondz gets away with this kind of in-your-face manipulation without coming off as intolerably self-indulgent. Chalk it up to good writing, I guess.Aviva's name is a palindrome, like the title says. I assume this alludes to the film's second theme, which is people's inability to change. People are what they are, no matter how you look at them. And they have a certain worldview, no matter how they look at it. ""Palindromes"" presents Aviva's mother Joyce in fairly harsh light, but Ellen Barkin's funny, earnest, domineering delivery is the film's stand-out performance. Joyce is caring and generous toward her child, but not as ""liberal"" as she would like to think. She probably does the right thing for the wrong reason. She's selfish. And her concept of family clashes with her daughter's equally selfish concept of family. Jennifer Jason Leigh embodies Aviva at one point, and her middle-aged face and girlish physique fit the bill perfectly.Woody Allen tackled the question Is Life a Comedy or a Tragedy? in ""Melinda and Melinda"" earlier this year. It was an interesting question but a dull film. ""Palindromes"" is a better exploration of that idea. Some will find Aviva's experiences horrific; others will find the whole thing absurdly hilarious. It's probably good that it's never clear how seriously Todd Solondz wants us to take his films. But for Solondz fans, ""Palindromes"" is another provocative, darkly funny look at families though the experiences of a young protagonist. Just as a note: there is some confusion over Aviva's age. The film's web site says she is 12 years old, apparently in error. She is referred to as being 13 in the film, the press kit, and in statements by the director.The DVD (Wellspring 2005):  A theatrical trailer (2 minutes) is the only bonus feature.

However, there is a lot to recommend in Palindromes. The story is simple enough. A teenage girl, desperate for love and repelled by her selfish parents, runs away and meets all variety of mentally sick people on the way. As in most Solendz films, characters assert a facade of overdone piety and sanctimony that quickly dissolves and reveals a virulent selfishness, helplessness, and rage. Solendz has a theme, which is voiced by one of the characters, Mark Weiner, the older brother of Dawn Weiner, both of whom were featured in Welcome to the Dollhouse. Mark says we are all helpless, overtaken by our biology, completely absent of free will, completely powerless to change our lives. This helplessness is strongly articulated in the film but it is also the film's weakness: Watching helpless characters flailing in agony with no hope of change eliminates any kind of tension or narrative power, of which this film has little or none. The characters are shrill, self-pitying, effete, whining waifs who indulge in lugubrious melodrama. At times, their indulgences, their delusions, and their tantrums are so over the top that the film achieves a certain type of slapstick comedy. But the level of mental derangement coupled with helpless characters could be off-putting for many viewers.Final comment: There is a section, my favorite part, where a dozen handicapped children are under the care of a Mrs. Sunshine, a religious fanatic matriarch. Their talk of being in a loving, happy family is scripted. They come across as happy-talk androids. Mrs. Sunshine is a desperate, lonely women. It appears this section of the film had to be inspired by the award-winning documentary My Flesh and Blood, about a lonely single mother who adopts handicapped children.Strange film indeed.

Or are they really all the same girl in different guises, since they each share the palindromic name Aviva and keep taking one another`s places at key moments throughout the movie?  And if all this sounds more than slightly incomprehensible, welcome to the inscrutable world that is  ""Palindromes.""  All three girls are equally inarticulate and cloddish and suffer from aggravated cases of poor self-image, so I suppose they COULD all be the same person, though, in all honesty, I haven't the foggiest notion who anybody in this movie was supposed to be or how they happened to be related to one another.  Eventually, I just threw up my hands in stupefied resignation and - not being the world's greatest gamesman to begin with - gave up trying to figure any of it out at all.In an effort to paint American society in the worst light possible, Solondz has populated his film with endless caricatures of religious right extremists and in-bred country bumpkins.Solondz, who made a far more compelling and coherent movie named ""Storytelling"" a few years back, at least earns kudos for casting relatively ""unattractive"" actors in the key roles, thereby vaccinating his film against the Beautiful People virus that afflicts even the most ""independent ""of independent features these days.  But with ""Palindromes,"" the director may have erred too much in the other direction, producing a film that sees nothing but the bad side of life and expecting us to wallow in all the ugliness right along with him.Watching ""Palindromes"" is like throwing the pieces from three separate jigsaw puzzles into a giant pile, then attempting to put them together from the jumble that's been created.

Harrell,"[3, 3]","Solodnz breeches in Aviva the social and cultural expectations and burdens of young girls, showing that when Aviva embodies these expectations (albeit blindly) she's met with criticism and controlling adults with their own agendas.  The adults are all incredibly morally ambiguous, which very much plays into Aviva's lack of center or clue about the workings of the world.  Several different actresses play Aviva, their diverse appearances indicating her thoughts of herself, wishing she could be different, have a different life...  all tying back to the palindrome:  deconstruct a thing however you like, at core it doesn't change.  In a surreal way this tactic alone demonstrates a certain absolutism about the treatment of and perspective on 13 year old girls of any race, ethnicity or culture.  In the end Aviva withstands a wild experience, yet goes right back to her nature, the adults around her still oblivious.  The message is powerfully conveyed more visually rather than through dialogue.  To me though, more than illustrating a palindrome, it seemed that Aviva had no identity at all.This film touches on virtually all levels of child exploitation, from the Britney self-possessed-teen-sexuality variety, the perspective of pedophiliac intrigue and impulse, the Jackson 5 stage parent variety, all of which are in their own way socially condoned. Certainly buttons are pushed by the situations in the film, indicating both sides of the abortion issue, what constitutes a pedophile, moreover, what constitutes a 13 year old girl.  Disturbingly achieved,  Solodnz makes it easy to see yourself in every character.  Again, showing these diverse views brings up sensitive boundaries and liberties, revealing the flaws and truths of moral relativism.Quirky at best, though its message is powerful this film requires a lot of quick processing from its viewers to make sense.

He devotes approximately 1/3 of the film to discrediting extreme and irresponsible pro-choice people, which he demonstrates by including a monologue from a suburban mother who explains to her daughter the value of aborting a child when it has become an inconvenience. Another third is devoted to demonstrating the absurdity of the extreme Christian pro-life individuals (whom Solondz clearly despises even more), as he reveals a house run by Christian fanatics as they take in abandoned children and feed them with violent anti-abortion polemics. Clearly Solondz has many problems with organized religion, and many problems with suburban American life; however, he also seems to have a problem with humanity. He is unable to see anything redeeming in the human race, and all his characters exhibit weakness, evil, disability, stupidity, and deep-seeded depravity. This is a cruel and narrow vision of humanity and Solondz knows it, his films are simply a gathering of scenarios which are intended to shock and horrify, nothing more.

918556,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B000A1IOGG,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[0, 0]","This has got to be one of the most powerful, depressing films ever made. Todd Solondz has issues, but his films are always thought provoking, not to mention emotionally draining. This time around, he focuses on a thirteen year old girl named Aviva. Aviva's main goal in life is to become pregnant and be a mother, and so she sets off on a quest to make her dream a reality...with disastrous, often disturbing results. It should be noted that several different actors play the character of Aviva in each segment of the film. If it throws you off at first, stick with it. Not as complicated as you would think, and I thought it was a nice touch.On her journey, she encounters many odd characters including a family of pro-life, extremist Christian zealots -- it's hard to tell whether this is just satire, or flat out mockery -- we don't all act like this, just so you know...Aviva also befriends a pedophile named Bob, who takes advantage of her early on in the film at a nasty hotel, and then abandons her. Extremely unsettling stuff, and Solondz never lets up either.Aside from the sketchy subject matter, there are some beautiful moments in the film. One of my favorites was a segment entitled ""Huckleberry"". Simply amazing. The music in the film is also very, very nice. With that being said, I should mention that this is NOT for the average moviegoer. If your idea of a good movie is ""Roadhouse"", please do not watch this. There are several elements and subplots in this film that will unnerve, maybe even horrify some viewers in all of their raw power. However, if you are in the mood for a challenging film that will bring about strong emotions and give you some food for thought, by all means, see it. Just don't expect to be extremely happy once it's over. No, after this film, you're going to need to watch something lite...like ""Bambi"" lite...for there is no hope to be found in ""Palindromes"".

That is me making this all simplified so as not to give to much away.If you are turned off by Happiness and maybe even offended or disturbed by Storytelling, this one should be a little bit easier to handle, however it does deal with issues of abortion, child abuse, and religious fanatics.

I really liked Solondz's 'Happiness,' which is probably his best film so far, and it included child molester and tellephone stalker.  No, I am very disappointed with the way the film's story was told.The story is told in a mock fairy tale style.  It's about a girl named Aviva, who after being pregnant and experiencing terrible things after that (and her parents would not listen to her), she runs away from her home, and finds another family in the community in which children (many of whom are handicapped) read the Bible, sing religious songs, and pray for the God.  But you know, this is only the beginning of more shocking incidents that follow.[EIGHT 'AVIVA' ACTORS] Solondz thought of curious idea, which is, as previous reviewer says, that Aviva should be played by eight actors (and one of them is a boy).  It doesn't work.  I imagine he wanted to give the character of Aviva kind of everywoman quality, but the results are only irritating.Because of this strange decision, 'Aviva' is a detached, cold presence that few viewers can relate to, and that's a big problem because the success of Solondz's films like 'Happiness' clearly lies in Solondz's convincing characters. In 'Happiness' they do or suffer terrible things, but we are invited to share their viewpoints.  In 'Palindromes' the central character becomes a cypher.  Some viewers would be either impressed or shocked, even offended to see his satire about social issues like abortion represented by two portraits of 'American' family.  To me, however, the most unpleasant thing about the film is to watch Solondz, who created good characters in the past, is getting more and more self-indulgent like in 'Storytelling.'[HAVE TO WAIT LONG TO SEE JENNIFER JASON LEIGH] But this problem could be solved by casting good actors in the role.  No, sorry to say this, but few of the eight actors are good, and poor acting doesn't help when Aviva must look like a woman who desperately seeks for love.  Real pro gives some help when Jennifer Jason Leigh appears as Aviva, but too late (she is the last Aviva, and stays in the film very briefly).  Ellen Barkin as Aviva's mother is excellent, and other supports are all good.  And for Aviva, we need someone who can act, like Jane Adams, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Dylan Baker (all fantastic in 'Happiness') or Heather Matarazzo (yes, the poor girl in 'Welcome to the Dollhouse').And ... Dawn is dead.  I don't know why, but in 'Parindromes' Solondz killed his own character Dawn, heroine of his praised 'Wellcome to the Dollhouse.'  (Actually, Aviva is her relative).  But why did he do that?  Like this unnecessary move (and some would take it as real sin), sometimes it seems as if Solondz just doesn't know what he is doing in 'Palindrome' when his success is due to his talent to create convincing characters, not kill them.",2,Todd 'Happiness' Solondz's Least Successful Film,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,2966,"['give', 'only', 'two', 'stars', ""'Palindromes"", 'not', 'hot', 'subject', 'matters', 'abortion', 'religion', 'really', 'liked', 'Solondz', ""'Happiness"", 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'included', 'child', 'molester', 'tellephone', 'stalker', 'No', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'way', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'told.The', 'story', 'told', 'mock', 'fairy', 'tale', 'style', 'girl', 'named', 'Aviva', 'who', 'being', 'pregnant', 'experiencing', 'terrible', 'things', 'parents', 'would', 'not', 'listen', 'away', 'home', 'family', 'community', 'children', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'handicapped', 'read', 'Bible', 'sing', 'religious', 'songs', 'pray', 'God', 'know', 'only', 'beginning', 'more', 'shocking', 'incidents', 'follow', '[', 'EIGHT', ""'AVIVA"", 'ACTORS', ']', 'Solondz', 'thought', 'curious', 'idea', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'Aviva', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'eight', 'actors', 'one', 'boy', ""n't"", 'work', 'imagine', 'wanted', 'give', 'character', 'Aviva', 'kind', 'everywoman', 'quality', 'results', 'are', 'only', 'irritating.Because', 'strange', 'decision', 'detached', 'cold', 'presence', 'few', 'viewers', 'can', 'relate', 'big', 'problem', 'success', 'Solondz', 'films', ""'Happiness"", 'clearly', 'lies', 'Solondz', 'convincing', 'characters', ""'Happiness"", 'do', 'suffer', 'terrible', 'things', 'are', 'invited', 'share', 'viewpoints', ""'Palindromes"", 'central', 'character', 'cypher', 'viewers', 'would', 'be', 'either', 'impressed', 'shocked', 'even', 'offended', 'see', 'satire', 'social', 'issues', 'abortion', 'represented', 'two', 'portraits', ""'American"", 'family', 'however', 'most', 'unpleasant', 'thing', 'film', 'watch', 'Solondz', 'who', 'created', 'good', 'characters', 'past', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'self-indulgent', ""'Storytelling"", 'HAVE', 'TO', 'WAIT', 'LONG', 'TO', 'SEE', 'JENNIFER', 'JASON', 'LEIGH', ']', 'problem', 'could', 'be', 'solved', 'casting', 'good', 'actors', 'role', 'No', 'sorry', 'say', 'few', 'eight', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'poor', 'acting', ""n't"", 'help', 'when', 'Aviva', 'must', 'look', 'woman', 'who', 'desperately', 'love', 'Real', 'pro', 'help', 'when', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Aviva', 'too', 'late', 'last', 'Aviva', 'stays', 'film', 'very', 'briefly', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'Aviva', 'mother', 'excellent', 'other', 'supports', 'are', 'good', 'Aviva', 'need', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'fantastic', ""'Happiness"", 'Matarazzo', 'yes', 'poor', 'girl', ""'Welcome"", 'Dollhouse', '.And', 'Dawn', 'dead', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""'Parindromes"", 'Solondz', 'killed', 'own', 'character', 'Dawn', 'heroine', 'praised', ""'Wellcome"", 'Dollhouse', 'Actually', 'Aviva', 'relative', 'why', 'did', 'do', 'unnecessary', 'move', 'would', 'take', 'real', 'sin', 'sometimes', 'Solondz', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'doing', ""'Palindrome"", 'when', 'success', 'due', 'talent', 'create', 'convincing', 'characters', 'not', 'kill']",Palindromes
918562,A25PM9JGHPU8EI,B000A1IOGG,Wes,"[5, 8]","Solondz excels at making films which mesmerize. Along with ""Happiness"" and ""Storytelling"", this one just commands your total attention because you simply do not know what's coming, kept in thrall. The dinner table scene is so strange, so eminently bizarre. I just cannot get over how freakish a scene it is, how everyone is directed, how oddly it is edited together. That's Solondz for you; a director for whom each new work is eagerly anticipated. I loved this film. You won't find any extras here - and that's not a bad thing in this instance. You watch a film like this, and you almost don't want to know much about it's production. I don't want to know where the kids came from. I don't want to know about who did this or that. It's just this small gem you appreciate as is, no backstory. There is an insert inside the case featuring some of Solondz' thoughts. The film isn't captioned or subtitled. It IS anamorphic (thankfully).",4,"And I'm Skippy, just like the peanut butter!",1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,934,"['Solondz', 'excels', 'making', 'films', 'mesmerize', 'Happiness', 'Storytelling', 'one', 'just', 'total', 'attention', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'kept', 'thrall', 'dinner', 'table', 'scene', 'so', 'strange', 'so', 'eminently', 'bizarre', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'how', 'freakish', 'scene', 'how', 'everyone', 'directed', 'how', 'oddly', 'edited', 'together', 'Solondz', 'director', 'whom', 'new', 'work', 'eagerly', 'anticipated', 'loved', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'extras', 'here', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'instance', 'watch', 'film', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'much', 'production', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'where', 'kids', 'came', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'who', 'did', 'just', 'small', 'gem', 'appreciate', 'backstory', 'insert', 'case', 'featuring', 'Solondz', 'thoughts', 'film', ""n't"", 'captioned', 'subtitled', 'anamorphic', 'thankfully']",Palindromes
