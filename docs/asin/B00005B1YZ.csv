579885,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00005B1YZ,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[3, 4]","Carman is excellent as Orlando Leone, a security guard and former boxing champ, who has dreams of helping his community, the troubled kids in it, and leading his small church, which is why everyone calls him ""The Preacher."" He tangles with the current champion in the hotel where he is employed, and it leads to a ""The Saint vs. The Sinner"" match. There are numerous sub-plots that surround the match-up, including Orlando meeting his love interest, the mother of a delinquent child who breaks into his car.The boxing footage is the best part of ""The Champion.""  It's fast and gritty, and well choreographed and filmed, and overall, the direction by Lee Stanley and the acting by the entire cast is above average for a low-budget B movie. Jeremy Williams is impressive as the street thug turned champion Keshon Banks, Patricia Manterola beautiful as Orlando's love Allia, and Michael Nouri as his brother Freddie, whose motives are dark and crooked, and Jay Allen Jones as Orlando's friend Johnny are very good.This TBN production is only peripherally a Christian film, and if you blinked a few times, you might miss the ""religious content."" It is nevertheless fairly wholesome fare, with the themes of integrity and giving to others, and worth seeing if you like boxing films without having your ears assaulted with foul language (also not to be missed in this category, and a superb film, is ""Cinderella Man""). Carman has used many of his talents in this film, in the writing, and the film score, which uses some of his songs, and though ""The Champion"" may be occasionally a little cheesy and rough around the edges, it's very entertaining, and fine viewing for the entire family.",4,The Saint  vs. The Sinner,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,1682,"['Carman', 'excellent', 'Orlando', 'Leone', 'security', 'guard', 'former', 'boxing', 'champ', 'who', 'dreams', 'helping', 'community', 'troubled', 'kids', 'leading', 'small', 'church', 'why', 'everyone', 'Preacher', 'current', 'champion', 'hotel', 'where', 'employed', 'Saint', 'vs', 'Sinner', 'match', 'are', 'numerous', 'sub-plots', 'surround', 'match-up', 'including', 'Orlando', 'meeting', 'love', 'interest', 'mother', 'delinquent', 'child', 'who', 'car.The', 'boxing', 'footage', 'best', 'part', 'Champion', 'fast', 'gritty', 'well', 'choreographed', 'filmed', 'overall', 'direction', 'Lee', 'Stanley', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'above', 'average', 'low-budget', 'B', 'movie', 'Jeremy', 'Williams', 'impressive', 'street', 'thug', 'turned', 'champion', 'Keshon', 'Banks', 'Patricia', 'Manterola', 'beautiful', 'Orlando', 'love', 'Allia', 'Michael', 'Nouri', 'brother', 'Freddie', 'motives', 'are', 'dark', 'crooked', 'Jay', 'Allen', 'Jones', 'Orlando', 'friend', 'Johnny', 'are', 'very', 'good.This', 'TBN', 'production', 'only', 'peripherally', 'Christian', 'film', 'blinked', 'few', 'times', 'might', 'miss', 'religious', 'content', 'nevertheless', 'fairly', 'wholesome', 'fare', 'themes', 'integrity', 'giving', 'others', 'seeing', 'like', 'boxing', 'films', 'having', 'ears', 'assaulted', 'foul', 'language', 'also', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'category', 'superb', 'film', 'Cinderella', 'Man', 'Carman', 'used', 'many', 'talents', 'film', 'writing', 'film', 'score', 'songs', 'Champion', 'may', 'be', 'occasionally', 'little', 'cheesy', 'rough', 'edges', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fine', 'viewing', 'entire', 'family']",N/A

579888,A2DK2OY6R3WICK,B00005B1YZ,C.W. Fitch,"[6, 12]","There's no question that Carman is one of the great entertainers of our time.  The fact that he's ""working for the Kingdom"" makes it even better.  His voice is marvelous, his charisma is energizing, and his message is one of the most powerful you'll ever hear.But there's a small part of me that thinks he should leave all of that on the stage and on his website.  That tiny seed was planted after I saw this movie.  There was a LOT of hype surrounding ""The Champion"" before it came out in theaters, especially on the Trinity Network, but as far as being as good as almost everyone said it would be, I just have to say...uh, no.  As a movie, it falls just short of made-for-TV in quality, with a less-than-basic plot (you see just about everything that happens in this flick coming from a mile away), laughable action scenes, and dialogue that made me want to cringe at times.  ([...] the Hispanic characters didn't even speak proper Spanish!)  As a message, it falls just short of sending one.  If there is a message somewhere in this flick, then what is it?  ""Don't get involved with the Mafia in order to achieve your dreams""?  One would think that a movie like this would have a moral or something in it to help one grow spiritually, but I didn't see it at all.  To me, it was like just about any other direct-to-video action-drama cheese that's out there.  There were a couple of moments that'll stick with me, though; the ""commercial shoot"" was pretty funny (although they could've used ANY other product but that one), and the pre-match conference scene with the champ's ""even God wouldn't recognize him"" line.  Otherwise, even Carman fans should steer clear of this one.  Carman sends much more positive messages through his music, and far as me, that's what he should stick to.",2,"Y'know, as an actor, he's a wonderful singer.",996364800,"07 29, 2001",2001,1786,"['question', 'Carman', 'one', 'great', 'entertainers', 'time', 'fact', 'working', 'Kingdom', 'even', 'better', 'voice', 'marvelous', 'charisma', 'energizing', 'message', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'hear.But', 'small', 'part', 'should', 'leave', 'stage', 'website', 'tiny', 'seed', 'was', 'planted', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'LOT', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'Champion', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'especially', 'Trinity', 'Network', 'as', 'far', 'as', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'almost', 'everyone', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'uh', 'movie', 'just', 'short', 'made-for-TV', 'quality', 'less-than-basic', 'plot', 'see', 'just', 'everything', 'flick', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'laughable', 'action', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'made', 'want', 'cringe', 'times', '[', 'Hispanic', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'proper', 'Spanish', 'message', 'just', 'short', 'sending', 'one', 'message', 'somewhere', 'flick', 'then', 'what', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'involved', 'Mafia', 'order', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'moral', 'something', 'help', 'one', 'grow', 'spiritually', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'was', 'like', 'just', 'other', 'direct-to-video', 'action-drama', 'cheese', 'out', 'there', 'were', 'couple', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'though', 'commercial', 'shoot', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'ANY', 'other', 'product', 'one', 'pre-match', 'conference', 'scene', 'champ', 'even', 'God', 'would', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'line', 'Otherwise', 'even', 'Carman', 'fans', 'should', 'steer', 'clear', 'one', 'Carman', 'much', 'more', 'positive', 'messages', 'music', 'far', 'what', 'should', 'stick']",N/A
