After well over a decade Joan herself said ""this is for me"" and the studio, not knowing what else to do with her, tossed her this bone.  And what a bone.Away from Gable and Montgomery and Tracy she is the star of the show.  And what a show.  It's not a great show (it gets sloppy in the second half) but this is Joan Crawford without a costar (Melvyn Douglas?) and without glamorous settings, unless you count snowbanks and late night bars as glamorous.It's her high point at MGM, circa 1941.  And in 1941 MGM was the place to be.  And Crawford knew it.  She took the role and ran.  And she gallops.George Cukor directs this tale of a scarred woman involved in blackmail.  The first half is better than the second, which slides into melodrama, but the production qualities are wonderful.  It's Crawford's last good hitch at MGM.  And she makes the best of it.Drama and intrigue and mystery give way, in the second half, to snowbanks and some old guys birthday party and a sleigh ride with Joan toting a gun and some drippy, cute kid who is the reason why all of the snowbanks and suspicion happens in the first place.  It may sound silly but it's her best role at the studio of the stars.  She shines here.  And yes, she shoots the gun.Melvyn Douglas is his usual self.  Capable and perfunctory.  He's there.  Live with it.  He's integral to the plot, and the plot ends with him and Joan so just get used to him being there.  Okay?Crawford, after ""The Women"" was really willing to stretch her limited wings and certainly did so.  ""Strange Cargo"", ""Susan and God"" and this film, ""A Woman's Face""  Anyone like that you have to admire.

She meets Conrad Veidt, an even nastier character, and they scheme to murder Veidt's little nephew in order to get his inheritance.But then Crawford meets a doctor (Melvyn Douglas) who performs an operation on her face and makes her beautiful. She goes back to Veidt, who wants to pick up where they left off, but Crawford is a ""changed"" woman - inside and out. When Veidt tries to murder the nephew himself, Crawford shoots him, which brings about her trial for murder.The whole plot of the movie is told in flashbacks at the trial as each witness comes before the judge and tells what he knows - an interesting idea, despite being somewhat stagey. Crawford, Veidt, and Douglas all perform admirably, and George Cukor's direction is good, as far as it goes. The ""mediocrity"" mentioned at the beginning of this review centers on the material, the story itself, which seems rather tired and mild, and no one (not Cukor or any of the actors) comes forward to go beyond it.

287816,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6301978439,JGC,"[6, 8]","In the 1940's Joan's career really started to unravel. She was no longer the sweet little working girl. Joan wanted to branch out and show her true acting capabilities, and ""A Woman's Face"" was her first shot at that, and one of her most ambitious feature presentations.In this gorgeous black and white film, Joan played Anna Holm, otherwise known as Ingrid Paulson. Anna lived with a severe facial scar that left her disfigured. Joan looked completely different as Anna because she was no longer glamorous or dressed to the nines. Even when she played the poorest working girl, Joan always looked devastatingly beautiful. In ""A Woman's Face"" she relied on her natural talent of acting to shine through by letting the viewers see a unique and diverse piece of her.Here are Miss Crawford's personal comments about this film: I have nothing but the best to say for ""A Woman's Face."" I finally shocked both the critics and the public into realizing the fact that I really was, at heart, a dramatic actress.The apparent self-hatred that Anna feels is very evident. This woman can hardly even look in the mirror, let alone allow anyone to look at her face. She is in constant pain. Because, like an old newspaper the world just threw her away and discarded her without a second thought. Anna would think nothing of conning anyone because she hates everyone, but most of all, she hates herself.Anna soon has a new lease on life, thanks to Dr. Dr. Gustaf Segert (played by the legendary Melvyn Douglas) who performs surgery on her face and transforms her into the beauty that we are all more familiar with. But she gets mixed up with her lover, Torsten Barring, (Conrad Veidt) who only wants to use her and  take advantage of her for his own dishonest gain.This is one of those rare movies that Joan made where her true acting really shines brighter than anything else. It was also a rather unique picture because Joan's character was so corrupt, yet so vulnerable. I consider this role a pivotal part for Joan, just as Sadie Thompson was inRainandHarriet Craigwas (movie same title.) Because all of these women were so perpetually abused and all of them had so much hostility. But, ""A Woman's Face"" is altered from the others, because the transformation of Anna was perhaps more subtle and mysterious.The director of the film is the renowned George Cukor (Camille&Two Faced Woman) and the film is 105 minutes in length. Like the majority of her movies, throughout her fifty year career, this movie was produced by MGM. And, like the majority of her films today, ""A Woman's Face"" is distributed by Warner Home Video.Some people can't believe that someone who's barely out of their teens would be infatuated with a woman who made movies half of a century ago. There is so much about Joan that fascinates me. She just gave so much of herself. She gave everything she had when she made a movie. Joan was the quintessential example of what a true movie star was (and should be.) And besides, there aren't any stars of my generation who have the talent, determination, stamina, drive and sheer will-power that Joan Crawford always possessed.",5,"Joan: I finally shocked both the critics and the public into realizing the fact that I really was, at heart, a dramatic actress!",1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,3129,"['1940', 'Joan', 'career', 'really', 'started', 'unravel', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'sweet', 'little', 'working', 'girl', 'Joan', 'wanted', 'branch', 'out', 'show', 'true', 'acting', 'capabilities', 'A', 'Woman', 'Face', 'was', 'first', 'shot', 'one', 'most', 'ambitious', 'feature', 'presentations.In', 'gorgeous', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'Joan', 'played', 'Anna', 'Holm', 'otherwise', 'known', 'Ingrid', 'Paulson', 'Anna', 'lived', 'severe', 'facial', 'scar', 'left', 'disfigured', 'Joan', 'looked', 'completely', 'different', 'Anna', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'glamorous', 'dressed', 'nines', 'Even', 'when', 'played', 'poorest', 'working', 'girl', 'Joan', 'always', 'looked', 'devastatingly', 'beautiful', 'A', 'Woman', 'Face', 'relied', 'natural', 'talent', 'acting', 'shine', 'letting', 'viewers', 'see', 'unique', 'diverse', 'piece', 'her.Here', 'are', 'Miss', 'Crawford', 'personal', 'comments', 'film', 'have', 'nothing', 'best', 'say', 'A', 'Woman', 'Face', 'finally', 'shocked', 'critics', 'public', 'realizing', 'fact', 'really', 'was', 'heart', 'dramatic', 'actress.The', 'apparent', 'self-hatred', 'Anna', 'feels', 'very', 'evident', 'woman', 'can', 'hardly', 'even', 'look', 'mirror', 'let', 'alone', 'allow', 'anyone', 'look', 'face', 'constant', 'pain', 'old', 'newspaper', 'world', 'just', 'threw', 'away', 'discarded', 'second', 'thought', 'Anna', 'would', 'think', 'nothing', 'conning', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'most', 'herself.Anna', 'soon', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'thanks', 'Dr.', 'Dr.', 'Gustaf', 'Segert', 'played', 'legendary', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'who', 'surgery', 'face', 'beauty', 'are', 'more', 'familiar', 'mixed', 'up', 'lover', 'Torsten', 'Barring', 'Conrad', 'Veidt', 'who', 'only', 'use', 'take', 'advantage', 'own', 'dishonest', 'gain.This', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'Joan', 'made', 'where', 'true', 'acting', 'really', 'shines', 'brighter', 'anything', 'else', 'was', 'also', 'rather', 'unique', 'picture', 'Joan', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'corrupt', 'yet', 'so', 'vulnerable', 'consider', 'role', 'pivotal', 'part', 'Joan', 'just', 'Sadie', 'Thompson', 'was', 'inRainandHarriet', 'Craigwas', 'movie', 'same', 'title', 'women', 'were', 'so', 'perpetually', 'abused', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'hostility', 'Woman', 'Face', 'altered', 'others', 'transformation', 'Anna', 'was', 'perhaps', 'more', 'subtle', 'mysterious.The', 'director', 'film', 'renowned', 'George', 'Cukor', 'Camille', 'Two', 'Faced', 'Woman', 'film', '105', 'minutes', 'length', 'majority', 'movies', 'fifty', 'year', 'career', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'MGM', 'majority', 'films', 'today', 'Woman', 'Face', 'distributed', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video.Some', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'someone', 'who', 'barely', 'teens', 'would', 'be', 'infatuated', 'woman', 'who', 'made', 'movies', 'half', 'century', 'ago', 'so', 'much', 'Joan', 'just', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'herself', 'gave', 'everything', 'had', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'Joan', 'was', 'quintessential', 'example', 'what', 'true', 'movie', 'star', 'was', 'should', 'be', 'are', ""n't"", 'stars', 'generation', 'who', 'have', 'talent', 'determination', 'stamina', 'drive', 'sheer', 'will-power', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'always', 'possessed']",Woman's Face VHS

It took courage for Crawford, who was, in 1941, the glamour girl of 49 movies and the idol of autograph hounds to be the face in A WOMAN'S FACE. When you come to know her as Anna Holm on the screen, she is a sullen slattern, the brain trust of a ring of sniveling criminals, a sort of female ""Sea Wolf"" who beats, bullies and blackmails her victims. The reason for this behaviour you discover in a series of flashbacks from a Swedish courtroom, where, heavily veiled, Anna stands trial for murder. From the testimony you learn that when she was 5, her brilliant, drunken father had set fire to her room. From then on she has been disfigured by a ghastly scar that criss-crosses her right cheek from mouth to eye and is only rarely revealed by M-G-M. Shunned by a horrified society, she has sought refuge in music, painting, poetry and alcohol only to find final solace and revenge in a life of crime. All this changes when she meets Conrad Veidt...........M-G-M's remake of the 1937 Swedish film - which starred Ingrid Bergman - unfortunately loses its brisk forward-moving psychological narrative and dissolves into an overexposure of melodramatic sweetness and light.

287821,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301978439,Simon Davis,"[8, 8]","I've always thought the period from 1939 to 1942 was an extremely interesting time in Joan Crawford's career. As one of the three Queens of MGM along with Greta Garbo and Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford was long regarded as MGM's resident ""shopgirl"", most often seen in vehicles where her character by sheer grit and determination usually clawed her way to the upper levels of society. By 1939 Joan was inevitably outgrowing those type of parts and being the total career strategist that she was she began taking more risks with the type of roles she tackled. ""A Woman's Face"", coming along in 1941 was one such ""non traditional"", role that she undertook at this time and it resulted in one of her finest efforts up to that date and contains without a doubt some of the best acting of Joan's long career at the studio of studios, MGM. Under the always sure direction of the legendary director George Cukor who she had just had another success with in ""Susan and God"", Joan  totally submerges herself in the character of the embittered and horrifically scarred Anna Holm with amazing dramatic results that helps create a riverting story of sadness and bitterness redeemed by love and understanding.Based on the earlier Swedish film ""En Kvinnas Ansikte"", starring a young Ingrid Bergman which in turn was based on the celebrated play ""II Etait Une Fois"", by Francois De Croisset, the new effort keeps the locale and the same main characters with more of an American flavour to it with some of Hollywood's major lead and supporting actors filing the roles. We are first introduced to Anna Holm (Crawford), during a court case where she is on trial for the murder of Torsten Barring (Conrad Veidt). Told in flashback we see her living a lonely and loveless life in Stockholm. Horribly scarred by a childhood accident Anna leads an embittered existence where she has allowed her own frustrations to be taken out on all those around her. She turns to becoming the leader of a ruthless blackmailing ring that operates by extorting money out of unfortunate individuals who find themselves in potentially embarrassing situations. Basing their centre of operations at a country roadhouse Anna comes into contact with scheming aristocrat Torsten Barring,  who happens to be short of both cash and any scruples about how to get it. He senses Anna's hunger for affection and he begins flattering her into believing she is an interesting and desirable woman. Of course he has ulterior motives for all this attention as he has plans to use Anna in his deadly scheme to murder his young nephew Lars Erik (Richard Nichols), who stands in the way of him receiving the family fortune on the event of the death of his ageing father Consul Barring (Albert Bassermann). In the meantime Anna continues to ply her trade of blackmail when her focus falls on wealthy Vera Segert (Osa Massen), the careless wife of prominent plastic surgeon Gustaf Segert (Melvyn Douglas). Attempting to exhort money from Vera over some careless love letters from Vera that have fallen into her possession Anna sprains her ankle trying to escape from the Segert's house and comes into contact with Gustaf. When he sees the terrible scar on her face Gustaf begins to take an interest in Anna and after showing her examples of how he has completely removed just as hideous disfigurements from others urges her to undergo surgery to remove her disfigurement. Anna agrees to undergo the surgery and the operations are a total success with Anna for the first time experiencing the feeling of being an attractive woman. However what has been repaired on the outside of the body is still no solution to the damage caused on the inside and Gustaf really wonders whether he has changed much at all and whether Anna is in fact a ""Frankenstein or a Galatea"". Wanting to show off her new appearance Anna goes to Torsten's apartment where her newfound beauty only fires his plans further towards obtaining his family fortune. He pursuades Anna to take a job as governess to Lars Erik and then stage an accident that will remove the claimant. Anna however grows attached to the infant and begins to see the wrong direction her life is taking her in when there is an opportunity to begin anew. When she is pushed into committing the murder Anna cannot go ahead with it and encouraged by the now besotted Gustaf she draws back from Torsten and his murderous scheme. Infuriated by Anna's betrayal Torsten now makes an attempt during a sleigh ride to murder the boy himself but in the frenzied pursuit Anna ends up shooting Torsten to save Lars Erik. Put on trial for murder a vital letter written by Anna to the Consul warning him about Torsten's intentions is revealed by jealous house keeper Emma Kristiansdotter (Marjorie Main)which shows that Anna acted in good intent. Gustaf now can see she was innocent of any wrong doing and agrees to stand by her for whatever happens in the  future.Certainly the second half of ""A Woman's Face"", does dissolve into melodrama but it is melodrama of the best kind and both portions of the story complement each other perfectly. George Cukor did a masterful job here with his direction of Joan Crawford and reportedly worked with her repeatedly to wear down any ""actressy"", mannerisms that Crawford might have normally brought to the proceedings. Certainly Joan displays an almost wistful quality in her acting when her new face is unveiled and she continually touches her face to see if it is actually hers. A normal person's natural anxiety and fear during the removal of her bandages also registers in Joan's facial expressions and deportment during that crucial scene where the audience waits with baited breath to see the results of her surgery. The earlier scenes when Anna is still a scarred and embittered blackmailer are some of Joan Crawford's finest pieces of acting. Here is no actress playing a villian, her Anna is a fully dimensional and embittered character taking her vengeance out on an uncaring world. Many other performers also shine in ""A Woman's Face"", in particular Conrad Veidt who made a speciality of these types of nasty individuals such as he plays here. Melvyn Douglas, a frequent Crawford leading man has the far more conventional leading man part here and really can't help but pale beside Veidt's more colurful charactersiation. Supporting performers Reginald Owen, Donald Meek and Connie Gilchrist really register as Anna's villianous pack of cold blooded blackmailers and Marjorie Main turns in an unexpectedly fine dramatic performance, very different to her better known work as a comedian, in the role of the jealous housekeeper who ends up holding the vital evidence that could save Anna's life when she is on trial.Given that it was considered one of MGM's major productions for 1941 the credits both in front of and behind the camera for ""A Woman's Face"", are first rate. I'm always amazed at the individual expertise in areas like set design, lighting and costume back in Hollywood's heyday and ""A Woman's Face"", is no exception with Cedric Gibbon's excellent Swedish set design and the legendary Adrian excelling in one of his last assignments at MGM with his authentic costume designs for the principals. Joan Crawford never really had as excellent an acting role in her remaining two years at MGM but her Anna Holm is a fitting tribute to her often underestimated talents as a dramatic actress. If you see only one Joan Crawford melodrama from her MGM years make sure it is George Cukor's riverting tale of murder, deceit and love in ""A Woman's Face"".",5,One Of Joan Crawford's Finest Hours As

She accepts, takes the surgery, and she is transformed outside with a flawless face. Yet she is still hanging with unsavory folks like Conrad Veidt, who tells her about his family where the young grandson is the sole heir of a great fortune and by her playing the governess she can help do away with the youngster. Well, she gets the job, but loves the little one and can't do the job, but eventually, she does an act and goes to trial where the movie starts up at. Very interesting case study and good movie.
