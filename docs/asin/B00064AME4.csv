This is a show about agents involved in espionage for the British government to protect England...but it goes far deeper than that.  You actually CARE about these people, who they love, who they break up with, and who dies.  Yes, people die, people betray each other, and people get framed (if you haven't seen it, I won't give that one away).  I love this show more than I love anything else on TV, and I am hopelessly addicted.

859702,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00064AME4,D. Mok,"[29, 30]","The fabulous cast, ambitious stories and dry humour all return in Series 2 of this hit UK show.The arc of the quality here seems to be the complete reverse of Series 1. While I enjoyed both series, Series 1 had been marred by a pilot that made precious little sense and carried almost no sense of danger.  Series 2 starts off on a roll and retains its momentum all the way until the final episode, when a somewhat contrived plot, too much exposition and a forced ending (which the writer admits was necessitated by a question about whether a cast member would return for Series 3) mar the enjoyment.But it remains a strong 10 episodes.  All the talent involved -- directors, writers, actors -- appear to be more comfortable since the template of the show was already so clear from the first series.  Matthew MacFadyen is given more of a chance to chomp scenery, and he excels at it -- his marvellous way with confrontational dialogue is made more enjoyable by the fact that he still has that boyish face which sometimes can sneak into '80s Tom Cruise territory, but when he turns on the heat, MacFadyen's intensity is electrifying.  Keeley Hawes still has the ability to light up the screen with her English-rose beauty, but she's also given a mix of a heartbreaking subplot as well as some deadpan jokes, both of which she delivers with aplomb.  Megan Dodds is superb as CIA agent Christine Dale, an oddball cross of mischievous schoolgirl and vicious ice goddess. The fact that she never completely slides into either role makes her endlessly interesting to watch, and Dodds makes for a much stronger romantic interest for MacFadyen than Series 1's Esther Hall (Ellie).David Oyelowo is sadly given less emphasis in this series, but Peter Firth remains great as head spook Harry Pearce, and the loss of Jenny Agutter was really no big deal, the role of Tessa being too one-dimensional to be interesting anyway.  The ""older woman"" role is filled by new addition Nicola Walker, whose energy fits the cast much better.  Also new to the cast is Shauna Macdonald, a vibrant young Scottish actress who walks off with some of the funniest moments in the show.  This sense of humour continues to carve MI-5 an identity distinct from that of the American spy show, 24, despite the similarities.  In Series 2, MI-5 further indulges in its unique strengths:  Since this show doesn't shy away from using real names, real countries and real causes (nothing like 24 Season 2's ""these three Arab countries"" device here), this lends MI-5 a huge degree of verisimilitude which serves to make us even more on edge.  Let's face it, it's much more engaging, and liberating, to be able to hear ""Libya"" or ""President Bush and Tony Blair"" on the show than vague references to ""Arab countries"" and ""the Prime Minister and the Ambassador"".  I suppose American TV doesn't trust the audience to be willing to accept the idea of using real names in fiction, so when MI-5 throws you an episode where the Prime Minister and the royal family of Britain are all presumed dead, it's exhilarating to watch.My only grudge is with the final episode.  Again, it's the classic TV dilemma -- how do you deal with the potential departure of a central actor?  The episode is bogged down by the need to have an open-ended ending which allows them the freedom to bring the actor back (or otherwise).  But it's still moving in many places, especially the Romeo and Juliet trials and tribulations between Tom Quinn and Christine Dale, compounded by the fracture of the Harry-Tom-Zoe-Danny axis.A great show, and I can't wait for Series 3 to arrive.",5,Great shows all around until a slightly confusing season finale.,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,3604,"['fabulous', 'cast', 'ambitious', 'stories', 'dry', 'humour', 'return', 'Series', '2', 'hit', 'UK', 'show.The', 'arc', 'quality', 'here', 'be', 'complete', 'reverse', 'Series', '1', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'Series', '1', 'had', 'been', 'marred', 'pilot', 'made', 'precious', 'little', 'sense', 'carried', 'almost', 'sense', 'danger', '2', 'starts', 'off', 'roll', 'momentum', 'way', 'final', 'episode', 'when', 'somewhat', 'contrived', 'plot', 'too', 'much', 'exposition', 'forced', 'ending', 'writer', 'was', 'necessitated', 'question', 'cast', 'member', 'would', 'return', 'Series', '3', 'mar', 'enjoyment.But', 'strong', '10', 'episodes', 'talent', 'involved', 'directors', 'writers', 'actors', 'appear', 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'template', 'show', 'was', 'already', 'so', 'clear', 'first', 'series', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'given', 'more', 'chance', 'chomp', 'scenery', 'marvellous', 'way', 'confrontational', 'dialogue', 'made', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'fact', 'still', 'boyish', 'face', 'sometimes', 'can', 'sneak', ""'80s"", 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'territory', 'when', 'heat', 'MacFadyen', 'intensity', 'electrifying', 'Keeley', 'Hawes', 'still', 'ability', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'English-rose', 'beauty', 'also', 'given', 'mix', 'heartbreaking', 'subplot', 'as', 'well', 'deadpan', 'jokes', 'aplomb', 'Megan', 'Dodds', 'superb', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Christine', 'Dale', 'oddball', 'cross', 'mischievous', 'schoolgirl', 'vicious', 'ice', 'goddess', 'fact', 'never', 'completely', 'role', 'endlessly', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Dodds', 'much', 'stronger', 'romantic', 'interest', 'MacFadyen', 'Series', '1', 'Esther', 'Hall', 'Ellie', '.David', 'Oyelowo', 'sadly', 'given', 'less', 'emphasis', 'series', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'great', 'head', 'spook', 'Harry', 'Pearce', 'loss', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'was', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'role', 'Tessa', 'being', 'too', 'one-dimensional', 'be', 'interesting', 'anyway', 'older', 'woman', 'role', 'filled', 'new', 'addition', 'Nicola', 'Walker', 'energy', 'cast', 'much', 'better', 'Also', 'new', 'cast', 'Shauna', 'Macdonald', 'vibrant', 'young', 'Scottish', 'actress', 'who', 'off', 'funniest', 'moments', 'show', 'sense', 'humour', 'carve', 'MI-5', 'identity', 'distinct', 'American', 'spy', 'show', '24', 'similarities', 'Series', '2', 'MI-5', 'further', 'indulges', 'unique', 'strengths', 'show', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'using', 'real', 'names', 'real', 'countries', 'real', 'causes', 'nothing', '24', 'Season', '2', 'three', 'Arab', 'countries', 'device', 'here', 'MI-5', 'huge', 'degree', 'verisimilitude', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'edge', 'Let', 'face', 'much', 'more', 'engaging', 'liberating', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'Libya', 'President', 'Bush', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'show', 'vague', 'references', 'Arab', 'countries', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Ambassador', 'suppose', 'American', 'TV', ""n't"", 'trust', 'audience', 'be', 'willing', 'accept', 'idea', 'using', 'real', 'names', 'fiction', 'so', 'when', 'MI-5', 'throws', 'episode', 'where', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'royal', 'family', 'Britain', 'are', 'presumed', 'dead', 'exhilarating', 'watch.My', 'only', 'grudge', 'final', 'episode', 'Again', 'classic', 'TV', 'dilemma', 'how', 'do', 'deal', 'potential', 'departure', 'central', 'actor', 'episode', 'bogged', 'down', 'need', 'have', 'open-ended', 'ending', 'freedom', 'bring', 'actor', 'back', 'otherwise', 'still', 'moving', 'many', 'places', 'especially', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Tom', 'Quinn', 'Christine', 'Dale', 'compounded', 'fracture', 'Harry-Tom-Zoe-Danny', 'axis.A', 'great', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Series', '3', 'arrive']","MI-5, Vol. 2"

859710,A25JH6CO4DVINS,B00064AME4,Junglies,"[39, 54]","This second season of MI-5 covers quite a range of activities which may or may not constitute a threat to the state. Unlike some of the more glitzy glamorous shows about the secret services this is a little more gritty and a little more true to like effecting to shine a light into the dark to show some of the creepy crawlies running hither and thither. This is part of the attraction of the show which demonstrates the depths to which public servants will stoop to allow us to continue our daily lies.The only drawback to this drama is that it is a BBC production which, by it's very nature, exhibits a little schizophrenia - a highly polished production with a gloss and an angle to push.Having said that, there is more than a little truth which permeates the plotlines such as the constant competition between the different branches of the services and law enforcement within Britain itself as well as a constant competitive process with other foreign agencies throughout the world most notable from the American Security Services. What results is a love-hate relationship on both sides and where trust is a dirty word.It seems more than a little odd that more is not made of the exploration of the tendencies of the elected political establishment to be recorded and noted and exposed when it suits the services to do so. Given the range of activities included in this season, the exclusion seems stranger still. Similarly the depths to which elected government officials will stoop in following their own agendas is not a central focus her where it really ought to be.US viwers, seeing the complete episodes for the first time in this collection, will note the relatively open jibes against the Bush administration and it's foreign policy approach which permeate the entire season and are continued on the third, currently showing in truncated form on A&E.; Since the show first aired this has been a constant theme and demonstrates a political aspect of the BBC which really has no place given the exclusions mentioned above.Typically too for a show which sells across the world the season acts as a little tourist guide particularly to London with some exquisite shots of some of the panorama which makes up Britain's capital city.This series of fictional tales explores the  difficult personal lives of the major players involved which typically involves some difficult sacrifices and the consequent tendency to inbreeding with similar types of individuals. Who do you trust and who can you trust?It seems to me that the notion of the national interest is extremely subjective and much depends on the political outlook in vogue at the time. Many people are often left wondering whether or not these tales reflect actual events but are thinly disguised while others believe they are merely fiction.It is hard to tell but to any observer of events over the last forty years or so there is more than a grain of truth in each of them.I highly recommend this season notwithstanding any earlier remarks made about BBC bias. It is certainly a litttle more cerebral than your average spy show but I would like to think that the show's producers intend to make us think about what is done on our behalf in the name of democracy or whatever we prefer to call our system of government. Interestingly enough the whole notion of this show being produced in this form by the BBC in a time where a Labour Government has the watch is enough to set off conspiracy theorists across the world.A high quality drama, which makes us think, but by the BBC is a good result for the viewing public.Quis custodies custodiet?",5,You cannot believe your eyes,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,3607,"['second', 'season', 'MI-5', 'covers', 'quite', 'range', 'activities', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'constitute', 'threat', 'state', 'more', 'glitzy', 'glamorous', 'shows', 'secret', 'services', 'little', 'more', 'gritty', 'little', 'more', 'true', 'like', 'effecting', 'shine', 'light', 'dark', 'show', 'creepy', 'crawlies', 'running', 'hither', 'thither', 'part', 'attraction', 'show', 'depths', 'public', 'servants', 'will', 'stoop', 'allow', 'continue', 'daily', 'only', 'drawback', 'drama', 'BBC', 'production', 'very', 'nature', 'little', 'schizophrenia', 'highly', 'polished', 'production', 'gloss', 'angle', 'push.Having', 'said', 'more', 'little', 'truth', 'plotlines', 'such', 'constant', 'competition', 'different', 'branches', 'services', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Britain', 'as', 'well', 'constant', 'competitive', 'process', 'other', 'foreign', 'agencies', 'world', 'most', 'notable', 'American', 'Security', 'Services', 'What', 'results', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'sides', 'where', 'trust', 'dirty', 'word.It', 'more', 'little', 'odd', 'more', 'not', 'made', 'exploration', 'tendencies', 'elected', 'political', 'establishment', 'be', 'recorded', 'noted', 'exposed', 'when', 'suits', 'services', 'do', 'so', 'Given', 'range', 'activities', 'included', 'season', 'exclusion', 'stranger', 'still', 'Similarly', 'depths', 'elected', 'government', 'officials', 'will', 'stoop', 'following', 'own', 'agendas', 'not', 'central', 'focus', 'where', 'really', 'ought', 'be.US', 'viwers', 'seeing', 'complete', 'episodes', 'first', 'time', 'collection', 'will', 'note', 'relatively', 'open', 'jibes', 'Bush', 'administration', 'foreign', 'policy', 'approach', 'permeate', 'entire', 'season', 'are', 'continued', 'third', 'currently', 'showing', 'truncated', 'form', 'A', 'E', 'show', 'first', 'aired', 'been', 'constant', 'theme', 'political', 'aspect', 'BBC', 'really', 'place', 'given', 'exclusions', 'mentioned', 'above.Typically', 'too', 'show', 'world', 'season', 'little', 'tourist', 'guide', 'particularly', 'London', 'exquisite', 'shots', 'panorama', 'up', 'Britain', 'capital', 'city.This', 'series', 'fictional', 'tales', 'difficult', 'personal', 'lives', 'major', 'players', 'involved', 'typically', 'difficult', 'sacrifices', 'consequent', 'tendency', 'inbreeding', 'similar', 'types', 'individuals', 'Who', 'do', 'trust', 'who', 'can', 'trust', 'notion', 'national', 'interest', 'extremely', 'subjective', 'much', 'depends', 'political', 'outlook', 'vogue', 'time', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'often', 'left', 'wondering', 'not', 'tales', 'reflect', 'actual', 'events', 'are', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'others', 'believe', 'are', 'merely', 'fiction.It', 'hard', 'tell', 'observer', 'events', 'last', 'forty', 'years', 'so', 'more', 'grain', 'truth', 'them.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'season', 'notwithstanding', 'earlier', 'remarks', 'made', 'BBC', 'bias', 'certainly', 'litttle', 'more', 'cerebral', 'average', 'spy', 'show', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'show', 'producers', 'intend', 'make', 'think', 'what', 'done', 'behalf', 'name', 'democracy', 'prefer', 'call', 'system', 'government', 'Interestingly', 'whole', 'notion', 'show', 'being', 'produced', 'form', 'BBC', 'time', 'where', 'Labour', 'Government', 'watch', 'enough', 'set', 'off', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'world.A', 'high', 'quality', 'drama', 'think', 'BBC', 'good', 'result', 'viewing', 'public.Quis', 'custodies', 'custodiet']","MI-5, Vol. 2"

859718,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B00064AME4,"Ray ""A Reader""","[1, 2]","MI-5 is simply one of the most amazing TV drama shows to have been made. Focusing on that part of the British security services that focus on domestic threats (MI-6, in contrast, focuses primarily on international threats), MI-5 shows how the ""Defense of the Realm"" is carried out by normal individuals who join 5 to help it with its mission. The show is intensely exciting, intelligently written and superbly acted, and is so well produced that episodes seem more like one-hour movies than a television show. Episodes are focused on how MI-5 responds to a seemingly never ending series of domestic threats of all types, economic, political, terror, and public, and often highlights the toll these duties take on its members. The political backdrop under which 5 executes its duties is also often explored.In Season Two, the show really comes into its own. As we move past the Season One cliffhanger, the series starts kicking even further into high gear, and it is at this point that we can clearly see that everyone involved in the show--the writers, the directors, the actors, and the cast--have now precisely figured out how all the pieces of the show best fit together, and what can only be described as an immense amount of talent is focused solely on the development of the stories and plot lines. (MI-5 is really designed to be watched in order of episodes, without skipping, as the series is supremely good at weaving multiple, concurrent and intersecting plot lines that work across an entire season.) The emotional and dramatic levels reached in Season Two are high, and each episode ends with the viewer anxious to see the next installment, a characteristic of MI-5 that will now not stop all the way to end of its entire series run. We see all types of threats emerge in this Season, and the manner in which 5 is required to deal with each requires ingenuity, diligence, skill, and some amount of risk taking.There are few shows that I have seen that could compare to MI-5. It is a superb show. It's complex and intelligent enough to force you to stay on your toes to understand it all. It's dramatic and powerful. It makes you think about and question the proper role of the security services in any country, and the best manner in which to respond to the type of threats highlighted in the show. It doesn't shy away from awkward contradictions in political and security apparatuses, neither does it shy away from taking direct shots at a whole variety of national policies in both the UK and other countries. You will certainly be entertained, but you'll be educated at the same time, and you'll be made to think.On format ...There are as of late 2011 no Blu-Ray discs for any of the MI-5 Seasons. We can only hope these will be released in the near future, but for now, it will be on DVD that you watch. But that's not entirely a bad thing. The production and post-production values are so high that the DVD's really shine. MI-5 presently a glossy, artsy, and high-resolution world, even on DVD. (Consider coupling it with an upsampling DVD player, and you'll be getting a bit closer to Blu-Ray.) Some of the Seasons have been expensive to purchase, but prices seem to be coming down. There are typically between eight and ten 60-minute episodes per season.",5,SIX Stars Out of Five ...
