831835,A1CHOHPV418P15,B0002ERWUA,Boys' Mom,"[1, 1]","The front and back covers of the DVD case show kids/puppets with laundry, yet the DVD does not have a laundry segment.  The scenes that are shown are good: cleaning room, giving baby brother a bath, making fruit salad in kitchen, reading little sister a book, washing dog...; BUT, since my house resembles a small laundry factory, I was hoping my toddler would get a glimpse of children helping with the entire laundry process.  There is a short clip of a child carrying a laundry basket, but it's not an extended viewing of the laundry chore.  There is a TERRIBLE segment with the Buddies puppets taking a bath.  Yawn - it's approximately 5 minutes long (seems like an eternity); and I wonder what the point is - it's not funny, it's not educational.  In fact, my 2 year old always whines during the segment.  There is a boring animated sock matching exercise - match red sock with red sock, etc.  Overall, the DVD is good if your toddler has grown out of Baby Einstein.  The writers/directors of this DVD got close...but fell short of being great...I give it a ""good"" rating.",3,Did I miss the laundry scene?,1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,1077,"['front', 'back', 'covers', 'DVD', 'case', 'show', 'kids/puppets', 'laundry', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'laundry', 'segment', 'scenes', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'good', 'cleaning', 'room', 'giving', 'baby', 'brother', 'bath', 'making', 'fruit', 'salad', 'kitchen', 'reading', 'little', 'sister', 'book', 'washing', 'dog', 'BUT', 'house', 'small', 'laundry', 'factory', 'was', 'hoping', 'toddler', 'would', 'get', 'glimpse', 'children', 'helping', 'entire', 'laundry', 'process', 'short', 'clip', 'child', 'carrying', 'laundry', 'basket', 'not', 'extended', 'viewing', 'laundry', 'chore', 'TERRIBLE', 'segment', 'Buddies', 'taking', 'bath', 'approximately', '5', 'minutes', 'long', 'eternity', 'wonder', 'what', 'point', 'not', 'funny', 'not', 'educational', 'fact', '2', 'year', 'old', 'always', 'segment', 'boring', 'animated', 'sock', 'matching', 'exercise', 'match', 'red', 'sock', 'red', 'sock', 'etc', 'DVD', 'good', 'toddler', 'grown', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'writers/directors', 'DVD', 'got', 'close', 'fell', 'short', 'being', 'great', 'give', 'good', 'rating']",Nick Jr. Baby Curious Buddies - Helping at Home

For the next hour or so, your toddler will be so sugary and accommodating, you'll be happy when it wears off and you have your usual howler-monkey back.  It makes you appreciate your rude little cave-babies while possibly imparting some lasting lessons about manners and cleaning up toys to them. The puppets are of the same ilk as those on Jack's Big Music Show (same production company), but the writing, voicework and music are not.  This will not entertain anyone older than five.
