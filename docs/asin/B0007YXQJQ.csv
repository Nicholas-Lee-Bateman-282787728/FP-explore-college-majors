So, I admit that the big draw for me was Erika Eleniak (I love saying that name, over and over!). I have adored her ever since her cake-popping scene in UNDER SIEGE. Ahem, anyway, FATAL LESSONS: THE GOOD TEACHER is actually a fairly good thriller. Ms. Eleniak plays her homicidal role of Samantha, w/ gusto. The family that she victimizes is your basic suburban clan, complete w/ Dr. dad, Nurse mum, the kids, and the lovable family dog. Our eeevil villain gets to work fast, undermining the family unit, by isolating mum, etc. Also, Samantha uses her arcane herbal / pharmacological knowledge to incapacitate as well as kill. If you enjoy psychopathic / sociopathic movies like FATAL ATTRACTION, SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, etc., then FL:TGT, while nowhere near as intense or violent, should fit right in...",4,It's Time For Your Injection!...,1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,867,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'LIFETIME', 'movie', 'fan', 'So', 'admit', 'big', 'draw', 'was', 'Erika', 'Eleniak', 'love', 'saying', 'name', 'have', 'adored', 'ever', 'cake-popping', 'scene', 'UNDER', 'SIEGE', 'Ahem', 'anyway', 'FATAL', 'LESSONS', 'GOOD', 'TEACHER', 'actually', 'fairly', 'good', 'thriller', 'Ms.', 'Eleniak', 'homicidal', 'role', 'Samantha', 'w/', 'gusto', 'family', 'basic', 'suburban', 'clan', 'complete', 'w/', 'Dr.', 'dad', 'Nurse', 'mum', 'kids', 'lovable', 'family', 'dog', 'eeevil', 'villain', 'work', 'fast', 'undermining', 'family', 'unit', 'isolating', 'mum', 'etc', 'Also', 'Samantha', 'arcane', 'herbal', '/', 'pharmacological', 'knowledge', 'incapacitate', 'as', 'well', 'kill', 'enjoy', 'psychopathic', '/', 'sociopathic', 'movies', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'SINGLE', 'WHITE', 'FEMALE', 'THE', 'HAND', 'THAT', 'ROCKS', 'THE', 'CRADLE', 'etc.', 'then', 'FL', 'TGT', 'nowhere', 'intense', 'violent', 'should', 'fit', 'right']",N/A

895563,A2DQR20UWY2G0Y,B0007YXQJQ,"Dr. Metal ""e23adams""","[2, 2]","This one is fun to watch if you are into Thrillers.  The plot is nothing new; we've seen it all before with movies like ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle"" or ""The Sitter"".  A couple is looking for a someone to look after and teach their children.  Who could be better qualified than their childrens teacher, but the question is will this beautiful young woman actuall take such an offer.  When she does the couple is sure to have found the right Sitter for their 2 kids.  Little do they know that the person that they have trusted to look after their kids is not only a sexy young woman, but that she's also psychologically unstable, and has a criminal past.  But since she's gotten a new identity, no one is suspicious of ""The good teacher"".  Erika Eleniak is not only sexy but also very convincing in her role as the new teacher for the kids of that couple.  She has of course other ideas about what her role should be.  The job she does as a teacher is not to be permanent, since she's already set her eyes on the new family that she's teaching for.  I don't want to give away the story, but suffice it to say that there is enough suspense here to keep the movie going to the end.As I said before the story is really nothing new or special, but it certainly gets the job done.  Recommended for all thriller fans.  By the way, this is a low budget type of movie, but you can't really ever tell the difference.",4,Great B movie of a Thriller !,1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,1409,"['one', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'Thrillers', 'plot', 'nothing', 'new', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'Hand', 'Cradle', 'Sitter', 'couple', 'looking', 'someone', 'look', 'teach', 'children', 'Who', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'qualified', 'childrens', 'teacher', 'question', 'will', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'actuall', 'take', 'such', 'offer', 'When', 'couple', 'sure', 'have', 'found', 'right', 'Sitter', '2', 'kids', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'person', 'have', 'trusted', 'look', 'kids', 'not', 'only', 'sexy', 'young', 'woman', 'also', 'psychologically', 'unstable', 'criminal', 'past', 'gotten', 'new', 'identity', 'one', 'suspicious', 'good', 'teacher', 'Erika', 'Eleniak', 'not', 'only', 'sexy', 'also', 'very', 'convincing', 'role', 'new', 'teacher', 'kids', 'couple', 'course', 'other', 'ideas', 'what', 'role', 'should', 'be', 'job', 'teacher', 'not', 'be', 'permanent', 'already', 'set', 'eyes', 'new', 'family', 'teaching', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'story', 'say', 'enough', 'suspense', 'here', 'keep', 'movie', 'going', 'end.As', 'said', 'story', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'special', 'certainly', 'job', 'done', 'Recommended', 'thriller', 'fans', 'way', 'low', 'budget', 'type', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'ever', 'tell', 'difference']",N/A
895564,AUFK6UT2DU87H,B0007YXQJQ,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[12, 13]","""Fatal Lessons - The Good Teacher"" is a Lifetime televission movie that I first watched last year.  If you are looking for a suspenseful movie that provides escape after a hard day's work this may be what you want.The primise of this movie concerns a family who experiences the attentions of Victoria Page, (Erika Eleniak), who is the little girls new teacher.  Victoria is asked by the little girls mother to help tutor her daughter when a suitable helper cannot be found.  Victoria agrees.  Sounds innocent enough, doesn't it? Little does the family know that Victoria is a ruthless killer withthe an ability to manipulate situations and ingratiate herself into families.  She will stop at nothing to get what she wants.  Eleniak does a wonderful job at portraying her character, particularly in her gloating scenes.  I would love to have seen what she could have done with more material to work with.The plot and characterization in this movie lack development.  Victoria is an undeveloped character.  What she truly wants is never revealed, and there is no hint as to why she acts in the way she does.  As an instance of her actions, she provides the mother with herbal remedies that act in the opposite way they ar purported to act.  She pretends to be the ""good friend,"" but has ulterior motives.  It seems odd that her methods are not seen through more quickly.  It is up to the mother to save her family from a violent villainess.Bottom Line- A good movie for fun but not very unique.",3,Good suspense but little substance,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,1492,"['Fatal', 'Lessons', 'Good', 'Teacher', 'Lifetime', 'televission', 'movie', 'first', 'watched', 'last', 'year', 'are', 'looking', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'escape', 'hard', 'day', 'work', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'want.The', 'primise', 'movie', 'family', 'who', 'attentions', 'Victoria', 'Page', 'Erika', 'Eleniak', 'who', 'little', 'girls', 'new', 'teacher', 'Victoria', 'asked', 'little', 'girls', 'mother', 'help', 'tutor', 'daughter', 'when', 'suitable', 'helper', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'Victoria', 'Sounds', 'innocent', 'enough', ""n't"", 'Little', 'family', 'know', 'Victoria', 'ruthless', 'killer', 'withthe', 'ability', 'manipulate', 'situations', 'ingratiate', 'families', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'what', 'Eleniak', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'particularly', 'gloating', 'scenes', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'material', 'work', 'with.The', 'plot', 'characterization', 'movie', 'lack', 'development', 'Victoria', 'undeveloped', 'character', 'What', 'truly', 'never', 'revealed', 'hint', 'why', 'way', 'instance', 'actions', 'mother', 'herbal', 'remedies', 'act', 'opposite', 'way', 'ar', 'purported', 'act', 'be', 'good', 'friend', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'odd', 'methods', 'are', 'not', 'seen', 'more', 'quickly', 'mother', 'save', 'family', 'violent', 'villainess.Bottom', 'Line-', 'A', 'good', 'movie', 'fun', 'not', 'very', 'unique']",N/A
