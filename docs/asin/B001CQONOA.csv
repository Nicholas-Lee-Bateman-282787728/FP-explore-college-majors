1177133,AFBSF9LZJLOU6,B001CQONOA,Alexander Brown,"[0, 0]","This complete series is a wonderful addition to any DVD library, especially if you enjoyed watching the original programming on TV. This series includes commentaries to broaden your understanding of each episode if you so desire. For example, there was a necessary formula for each episode, which included an attractive woman and some mysterious archenemy. It's a futuristic Western, and I found it never to be dull or predicable, other than the fact that James West always wins.Robert Conrad, who plays James West, is too handsome for his own good, but he plays well on screen.James is accompanied and assisted by his handy and knowledgeable sidekick, Artemis Gordon, who is sufficiently less handsome than his companion not to be a threat to the ladies that grace the screen, but sufficiently adept to save James when he's in over his head in impossible situations.The title &#34;Wild Wild West&#34; is a play on words, given the hero is James West (a government agent sent around the country tackling impossible situations with the backing of the President. Having unlimited funding from Uncle Sam allows him access to toys that would limit other sleuths of the Old West. His 'home base' is an opulently furnished railway car he rides all over the country. He is definitely not a saddle-sore cowboy.I have not finished viewing all the episodes, but as a TV mystery series, it is still interesting. Each episode is entitled &#34;The Night of...&#34;You must bear in mind that the series is from the 1960's, and so the plots may not be as twisted and complex as some you view today; but if you sat in front of a TV back in 1965 and watched it every week, you will not worry about that.

That's exactly what happened to ""The Wild Wild West"", as CBS bowed to pressure over the violence of the series...but when you watch ""The Wild Wild West: The Complete Series"", you may be surprised; the violence is as tongue-in-cheek as the plotlines, humor, and characterizations, and this is a series I'd certainly have no qualms letting kids see. Truthfully, the show is terrific!Blending a 19th century setting with 20th century technology was not a new idea (film adaptations of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells have been doing it, for years), but series creator Michael Garrison hit upon a winning mix, by combining the long-popular Western genre with the spy craze, and adding an occasional dash of science fiction to spice things up. With just the right balance of action and humor (qualities other spy shows had trouble maintaining), and two stars with perfect chemistry (hunky Robert Conrad and urbane Ross Martin), ""The Wild Wild West"", even in weaker episodes, had consistently more adventure and entertainment value than any other series of it's time.There are several real pleasures in owning this collection...Of course, the episodes are great fun, with each season special, in it's own way, from the atmospheric B&W; plotlines of Season One (introducing the charmingly evil Dr. Miguelito Loveless, as personified by Michael Dunn), to Season Two's cliff-hanging color climaxes, to Season Three's more traditional approach (with Jim West's amazing horse highlighted, and the previously stoic agent occasionally breaking into laughter!), to Season Four's broader storylines (and temporary disappearance of Martin, after suffering a heart attack), before budget constraints forced the final episodes to occasionally rely on inserting action scenes from earlier seasons (considering how many series frequently air 'flashback' episodes to save money, it is remarkable that in four seasons of ""The Wild Wild West"", this is the only time any previous footage was ever used). Another pleasure is the opportunity to view both of the TV-Movie reunions, from 1979 and 1980 (and marvel at how little Conrad and Martin had aged!) While I wish Seasons Two through Four had the Robert Conrad introductions and other extra features the Season One episodes have, it's a minor quibble, as the collection does provide so much. You even get to see Conrad, Martin, and stunt man Red West on a daytime talk show from the late seventies, the infamous Conrad battery commercial (""Knock it off, I dare you!""), and to hear his own thoughts on the Will Smith movie version of the series.I really can't say enough about how much pleasure ""The Wild Wild West: The Complete Series"" has provided...I find I love the series more today, than when it first aired, over forty years ago!What a great collection!",5,"Jim and Artie, Back in Action!",1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,2890,"['Has', 'ever', 'been', 'series', 'been', 'cancelled', 'very', 'same', 'reason', 'remained', 'top-rated', 'show', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'CBS', 'bowed', 'pressure', 'violence', 'series', 'when', 'watch', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Complete', 'Series', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'violence', 'as', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'plotlines', 'humor', 'characterizations', 'series', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'have', 'qualms', 'letting', 'kids', 'see', 'Truthfully', 'show', 'terrific', 'Blending', '19th', 'century', 'setting', '20th', 'century', 'technology', 'was', 'not', 'new', 'idea', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'years', 'series', 'creator', 'Michael', 'Garrison', 'hit', 'winning', 'mix', 'combining', 'long-popular', 'Western', 'genre', 'spy', 'craze', 'adding', 'occasional', 'dash', 'science', 'fiction', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'action', 'humor', 'other', 'spy', 'shows', 'had', 'trouble', 'maintaining', 'two', 'stars', 'perfect', 'chemistry', 'hunky', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'urbane', 'Ross', 'Martin', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'even', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'had', 'consistently', 'more', 'adventure', 'entertainment', 'value', 'other', 'series', 'are', 'several', 'real', 'pleasures', 'owning', 'collection', 'course', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'fun', 'season', 'special', 'own', 'way', 'atmospheric', 'B', 'W', 'plotlines', 'Season', 'One', 'introducing', 'charmingly', 'evil', 'Dr.', 'Miguelito', 'Loveless', 'personified', 'Michael', 'Dunn', 'Season', 'Two', 'cliff-hanging', 'color', 'climaxes', 'Season', 'Three', 'more', 'traditional', 'approach', 'Jim', 'West', 'amazing', 'horse', 'highlighted', 'previously', 'stoic', 'agent', 'occasionally', 'breaking', 'laughter', 'Season', 'Four', 'broader', 'storylines', 'temporary', 'disappearance', 'Martin', 'suffering', 'heart', 'attack', 'budget', 'constraints', 'forced', 'final', 'episodes', 'occasionally', 'rely', 'inserting', 'action', 'scenes', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'considering', 'how', 'many', 'series', 'frequently', ""'flashback"", 'episodes', 'save', 'money', 'remarkable', 'four', 'seasons', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'only', 'time', 'previous', 'footage', 'was', 'ever', 'used', 'pleasure', 'opportunity', 'view', 'TV-Movie', 'reunions', '1979', '1980', 'marvel', 'how', 'little', 'Conrad', 'Martin', 'had', 'aged', 'wish', 'Seasons', 'Two', 'Four', 'had', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'introductions', 'other', 'extra', 'features', 'Season', 'One', 'have', 'minor', 'quibble', 'collection', 'provide', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'Conrad', 'Martin', 'stunt', 'man', 'Red', 'West', 'daytime', 'talk', 'show', 'late', 'seventies', 'infamous', 'Conrad', 'battery', 'commercial', 'Knock', 'off', 'dare', 'hear', 'own', 'thoughts', 'Will', 'Smith', 'movie', 'version', 'series.I', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'much', 'pleasure', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Complete', 'Series', 'provided', 'find', 'love', 'series', 'more', 'today', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'What', 'great', 'collection']",The Wild Wild West: The Complete Series

I remember it as a hokey '60s western, but it's pretty cool: an 1870s secret service agent traveling the west in an armored traincar, with his trusty sidekick Ross Martin, and all sorts of cool gadgets.  The gadgets include cars, modern movies, explosives, laser beams (!!!), and yes, androids.  Think 'Bonanza' with fembots and Robert Conrad.  The early black-and-white episodes are more mystery-oriented, the later color episodes a bit more campy.  Much like 'Lost In Space', which this show somewhat resembles (lots of familiar faces in both series.)Watch for the derringer hidden in Robert Conrad's arm.  It kind of 'feels' like Irwin Allen, but the writing is infinitely better for the most part.The opening sequence is clever with animated stills of various scenes becoming 'live' one-by-one.One major flaw, and the reason this set is not getting 5 stars - there is no ""play all"" feature on each DVD.  That is, one has to hit 'play' for each of the 4 episodes per DVD.  Kind of irritating, not a deal-stopper, but I would prefer for one hit of the button to play all of the episodes on the DVD.Worse, even though the set comes in a large box, there are no standard DVD cases, jewel cases, slimline cases, or anything else we've come to expect.  The DVDs come in a cardboard accordion-type sleeve, which I believe is supposed to be a saddlebag (and it's incredibly difficult to find the right sleeve when it's time to return the disc.)  I found some minor scratches on the DVDs - not enough to affect playability, but enough to make me wish for more standard DVD packaging.Comes with a bonus disc with the standalone movies from years later (1979's 'Wild Wild West Revisited, and 1980's 'More Wild Wild West.') Other than that, not a lot in the way of extras.Still, on balance, it's much better to have this DVD set than not.

But it takes nothing away from the fact that this is the best and most complete WWW package out there and should be owned by anyone who loves the series as much as me. Ratings shouldn't be about marketing so disregard the 1 stars. I should have given this 5 stars. My apologies for lowering it a couple due to marketing when I first submitted this review.I like everyone else who buys the WWW series has done so with anticipation of each series release. I bought the first 3 sets the 1st day or at least week they went on sale. Until I realized that patience can sometimes be rewarded. I watched on Amazon as the prices fluctuated and were cheaper at times for the same thing. So I waited on the 4th season and saved $14. Now the box set comes out and it's a better deal. Not unusual in marketing. I have to agree that offering the individual later released movies is necessary though for us loyal people who bought the sets as soon as they came out. We're the only ones interested in the later released movies in the first place. And we'll buy them day one just like we did the sets. This big box set wont do as well since all of us bought the seasons already and are not foolish enough to spend $90 on the box set to get what we already have plus the ""more WWW"" movies which are rated poorly anyway. We still would love to have these movies if reasonably priced. But I think I can say with confidance that most of us are in our 40's and 50's, regular guys and not really interested in being toyed with. We're too old and been there before. Make the WWW movies available at an honest price and we'll buy them. As for me, I'll wait a year and these movies will be released individually.

I like team work and the lesson it gives. We don't always get to do everything alone. Not as much team work as Mission Impossible but still shows the importance of reliance on others.Stories are generally very creative filled with Science Fiction ideas. Some of which might actually work :-) In summary the series gets a 5. So why 3? Because of packaging. It is so badly done that the DVDs may easily be damaged. The just stuff them next to each other in a few cardboard holders. My suggestion is to get a box of regular DVD holders at the same time you order this. As soon as you get the box take the DVDs out and put them in regular holders and be all set. Just hope they were not damaged in shipping. If so it is pretty simple to remove minor scratches.

We are amazed at the difference between then and now. It's interesting how our viewing preferences change over the years. Having said that, I still love watching it, but for different reasons. If the value of being entertained is to take you away from the stress and pressure of modern day living, this series is still doing an outstanding job of doing just  that. It's corny in the most delightful way.. to quote Julie Andrews. We're glad they changed to color in the second season, and we're looking forward to that.

1177173,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B001CQONOA,Gary P. Cohen,"[3, 3]","The Wild Wild West is one of my three all-time favorite shows (the others being U.N.C.L.E. and the original Hawaii Five-O)  Everyone knows that the premise of WWW was originally James Bond on horseback.  Most people know that it evolved from a more traditional western adventure to a series with many fantasy elements, a show that was itself as ahead of its time as the futuristic gadgetry used in some many episodes.  As one who watched this series from the first episode my favorite thing about this show was that it was as enjoyable its last episode as it was its first.  Many fantasy and action series from the 1960s devolved as they went along.  Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea started as a futuristic combination of sci. fi. and James Bond elements.  By its third season, it became the monster of the week series with the Submarine Seaview being menaced by the likes of evil Leprecans and Lobster-Men.  Lost in Space started fairly serious for about 5 or 6 episodes until it turned into the Dr. Smith and the Robot show sinking to levels unheard of like ""The Great Vegetable Rebellion"" featuring walking, talking vegetables.  The worst was The Man from U.N.C.L.E. which turned from an enjoyable spy romp played seriously its first and most of its second season to a third season featuring hiccup gas, explosive apples and an episode entitled ""My Friend the Gorilla Affair,"" possibly the worst episode of all-time.  This never happened to The Wild Wild West (although the two WWW movies did fall into that trap and as a result weren't very good.)I did not buy this box set as I already purchased each season separately.  As someone who has seen the episodes many times, I thought I would comment about some of my favorites from each season.A. The Night of the Puppeteer (season 1)  Probably the most imaginative of season 1.  In a Dr. Phibes-like episode Lloyd Bochner plays Zachariah Skull (one of my favorite names ever,) a mad puppeteer who uses life-like marionettes to put West on trial.  My favorite episode of the first season.B. The Night of the Man-Eating House (season 2) West, Gordon and a criminal they are escorting spend the night in a House of Usher-like house in the bayou.  A very creepy episode with a ghost, many spider-webs and an elderly villain played by Hurd Hatfield who gets younger as long as he remains in this living house.C. The Night of the Lord of Limbo (season 2) Ricardo Montalban as a disabled Confederate officer who has mastered the art of time travel and plans to use it to change the outcome of the Civil War.  Great episode.D. The Night of the Towering Tontine (season 2) My favorite of the several ""10 Little Indians""-like episode TWWW did, wherein a group of investors get murdered in imaginative ways, one at a time.  WWW did this type of plot extremely well.E. The Night of the Falcon (season 3)  Robert Duvall and a giant cannon threatening Denver.  A very memorable prop that was written up in a TV guide article.F. The Night of the Simian Terror (season 3)  My favorite gothic episode: lightning, wind, rain, murders, a mad scientist, a gorilla and Richard Kiel.  WWW had such great production values despite being made on a modest budget like most series of that era, this episode really shows those values.G. The Night of the Kraken (season 4)  My favorite sea monster episode with a (seemingly) giant squid and a villain played by Ted Knight.  Another very exciting episode.H. The Night of the Bleak Horror (season 4)  More gothic horror is a ""Hound of the Baskervilles""-like plot featuring a stormy island with waves crashing, thunder, lightning, a howling creature and Hitchcock-favorite John Williams as a Sherlock Holmes-like character assisting West. (This was the season where Ross Martin had suffered a heart attack and there were several guest-stars appearing to assist West, while Martin was recovering.)Well those are my favorite WWW episodes.  Of course, there are many more but those are my most memorable.In conclusion, WWW remained a quality show throughout the length of its run.  Theres no telling how long it could have lasted had it not been prematurely cancelled by CBS as a result of Congressional hearings on violence in tv.However to those of us who remember watching it every Friday night at 7:30, it remains a very memorable show and one that still holds up greatly.",5,One of the Most Imaginative Shows of All Time,1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,4344,"['Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'one', 'three', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'shows', 'others', 'being', 'U.N.C.L.E', 'original', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'Everyone', 'premise', 'WWW', 'was', 'originally', 'James', 'Bond', 'horseback', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'evolved', 'more', 'traditional', 'western', 'adventure', 'series', 'many', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'show', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'futuristic', 'gadgetry', 'used', 'many', 'episodes', 'one', 'who', 'watched', 'series', 'first', 'episode', 'favorite', 'thing', 'show', 'was', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'first', 'Many', 'fantasy', 'action', 'series', '1960s', 'devolved', 'went', 'along', 'Voyage', 'Bottom', 'Sea', 'started', 'futuristic', 'combination', 'sci', 'fi', 'James', 'Bond', 'elements', 'third', 'season', 'became', 'monster', 'week', 'series', 'Submarine', 'Seaview', 'being', 'menaced', 'likes', 'evil', 'Leprecans', 'Lobster-Men', 'Lost', 'Space', 'started', 'fairly', 'serious', 'about', '5', '6', 'episodes', 'turned', 'Dr.', 'Smith', 'Robot', 'show', 'sinking', 'levels', 'Great', 'Vegetable', 'Rebellion', 'featuring', 'walking', 'talking', 'vegetables', 'worst', 'was', 'Man', 'U.N.C.L.E', 'turned', 'enjoyable', 'spy', 'romp', 'played', 'seriously', 'first', 'most', 'second', 'season', 'third', 'season', 'featuring', 'hiccup', 'gas', 'explosive', 'apples', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Friend', 'Gorilla', 'Affair', 'possibly', 'worst', 'episode', 'all-time', 'never', 'happened', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'two', 'WWW', 'movies', 'did', 'fall', 'trap', 'result', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'buy', 'box', 'set', 'already', 'purchased', 'season', 'separately', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'episodes', 'many', 'times', 'thought', 'would', 'comment', 'favorites', 'season.A', 'Night', 'Puppeteer', 'season', '1', 'Probably', 'most', 'imaginative', 'season', '1', 'Dr.', 'Phibes-like', 'episode', 'Lloyd', 'Bochner', 'Zachariah', 'Skull', 'one', 'favorite', 'names', 'ever', 'mad', 'puppeteer', 'who', 'life-like', 'marionettes', 'put', 'West', 'trial', 'favorite', 'episode', 'first', 'season.B', 'Night', 'Man-Eating', 'House', 'season', '2', 'West', 'Gordon', 'criminal', 'are', 'escorting', 'spend', 'night', 'House', 'Usher-like', 'house', 'bayou', 'very', 'creepy', 'episode', 'ghost', 'many', 'spider-webs', 'elderly', 'villain', 'played', 'Hurd', 'Hatfield', 'who', 'younger', 'as', 'long', 'living', 'house.C', 'Night', 'Lord', 'Limbo', 'season', '2', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'disabled', 'Confederate', 'officer', 'who', 'mastered', 'art', 'time', 'travel', 'plans', 'use', 'change', 'outcome', 'Civil', 'War', 'Great', 'episode.D', 'Night', 'Towering', 'Tontine', 'season', '2', 'favorite', 'several', '10', 'Little', 'Indians', 'episode', 'TWWW', 'did', 'wherein', 'group', 'investors', 'get', 'murdered', 'imaginative', 'ways', 'one', 'time', 'WWW', 'did', 'type', 'plot', 'extremely', 'well.E', 'Night', 'Falcon', 'season', '3', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'giant', 'cannon', 'threatening', 'Denver', 'very', 'memorable', 'prop', 'was', 'written', 'up', 'TV', 'guide', 'article.F', 'Night', 'Simian', 'Terror', 'season', '3', 'favorite', 'gothic', 'episode', 'lightning', 'wind', 'rain', 'murders', 'mad', 'scientist', 'gorilla', 'Richard', 'Kiel', 'WWW', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'being', 'made', 'modest', 'budget', 'most', 'series', 'era', 'episode', 'really', 'values.G', 'Night', 'Kraken', 'season', '4', 'favorite', 'sea', 'monster', 'episode', 'seemingly', 'giant', 'squid', 'villain', 'played', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'very', 'exciting', 'episode.H', 'Night', 'Bleak', 'Horror', 'season', '4', 'More', 'gothic', 'horror', 'Hound', 'Baskervilles', '-like', 'plot', 'featuring', 'stormy', 'island', 'waves', 'crashing', 'thunder', 'lightning', 'howling', 'creature', 'Hitchcock-favorite', 'John', 'Williams', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes-like', 'character', 'assisting', 'West', 'was', 'season', 'where', 'Ross', 'Martin', 'had', 'suffered', 'heart', 'attack', 'were', 'several', 'guest-stars', 'appearing', 'assist', 'West', 'Martin', 'was', 'recovering', 'are', 'favorite', 'WWW', 'episodes', 'course', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'are', 'most', 'memorable.In', 'conclusion', 'WWW', 'remained', 'quality', 'show', 'length', 'run', 'telling', 'how', 'long', 'could', 'have', 'lasted', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'prematurely', 'cancelled', 'CBS', 'result', 'Congressional', 'hearings', 'violence', 'tv.However', 'who', 'remember', 'watching', 'Friday', 'night', '7:30', 'very', 'memorable', 'show', 'one', 'still', 'up', 'greatly']",The Wild Wild West: The Complete Series

When I read the reviews before I bought this, I kept thinking to myself, ""how bad could the packaging really be..."" --- well .....BAD!!  So bad, that in order to protect the discs from further scuffing, they truly cannot stay in their original box.  In fact, I'm floored that these discs play at all (so far, they do, and I had better hope they continue to because I've pitched the box already)..they are more scratched up looking than some of the various DVD discs my kids have abused over the years.  We've played probably 7 or 8 of these discs (and we didn't start with disc 1 and go from there -- purposely, we did some ""sampling"" throughout the pack because I was envisioning this would be the first set I would have to return to Amazon....in fact, hubs thinks that we actually probably got a returned set because visually these look SO bad, they do not look new at all....) ....but so far they play perfectly.  And others who did return their set, got replacements that were JUST as bad...so I figured we'd keep them if they play..and they do (so far).The show is as we remember it and my husband (it was a birthday gift for him) really enjoys it.  But we can't display them (like I would like to, in their original box) on the DVD bookcase we have along with the others which is a shame. Part of the fun to me is to have a nice big colorful collection of neatly arranged box sets to choose from..and then, next to those, is a little black wallet with ""Wild Wild West"" written on it in a marker.What were they thinking when they designed the packaging.  It's hardly difficult to come up with good DVD pkg now-a-days - not like they have to reinvent the wheel ....its been done before!  And cost effectively too.  In fact, I don't think this was so much that the mfgs were trying to be cheap (although they achieved that remarkably well) - it is more pure negligence on their part.

Yet another gimick box set designed to scratch disks when inserted into tight cardboard disk holders.Unless you get this for a greatly reduced price and or just *have* to get the rather lackluster later movies, the individual sets are better packaged and an overall better value because of the better packaging.",3,Early purchasers/adopters get another milking,1218585600,"08 13, 2008",2008,952,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', '5', 'star', 'series', 'quality', 'seasons', 'excellent', 'also', 'deserving', '5', 'stars', 'once', 'again', 'major', 'studio', 'box', 'set', 'extras', 'reported', 'not', 'be', 'available', 'separately', 'why', '3', 'instead', '5', ""'ll"", 'get', 'four', 'remastered', 'seasons', 'same', 'features', 'bonuses', 'etc', 'individual', 'sets', 'reunion', 'films', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Revisited', '1979', 'More', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', '1980.The', 'primary', 'downside', 'are', 'plans', 'release', '2', 'reunion', 'films', 'separately', ""'ll"", 'have', 'spring', 'set', 'get', 'them.Another', 'downside', 'packaging', 'gimick', 'box', 'set', 'designed', 'scratch', 'disks', 'when', 'inserted', 'tight', 'cardboard', 'disk', 'holders.Unless', 'get', 'greatly', 'reduced', 'price', 'just', '*have*', 'get', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'later', 'movies', 'individual', 'sets', 'are', 'better', 'packaged', 'overall', 'better', 'value', 'better', 'packaging']",The Wild Wild West: The Complete Series

The discs are loosely packed in two holders. This has got to be the worst design ever. The flap does not hold the discs firmly and, through multiple handling of the case, they rattle around and get scuffed. I'm not talking about light scuffing that can be buffed out. These are major scratches.The case, itself, is absolutely stunning. The graphics look like an leather box with metal corners. It's raised and metal embossed. If you don't know what that means, the corners and lettering look like metal and all the designs pop out and feel like real leather crafting.Now, I have the first two seasons already and just got this to get all and the bonus movies. Took advantage of the week long special for $29.99 as it was cheaper than get the last two seasons individually. Also have to get this set for the bonus movies. I had hoped to give the one's I have away but the first two seasons had the worst damage. I will, most likely, transfer all of these to discs and shelve the originals.As I've done with similar packaged editions (the Shout! Factory Bruce Lee collection in particular) I got multi-disc DVD cases and put them in there. Either scanned  the original artwork from the packaging or downloaded covers on some sites and printed them out so they look decent on the shelf. I just put away the bulk packaging on my oversized/special packaging shelf.The transfers are really good and show little wear and tear. The First Season has most of the special features.I, reluctantly, recommend this set. It's currently selling, as of May 28th, 2014, for $59.99. Even at that price it's beating out buying the seasons individually as they're going for $70 - $100 total. If you liked this show then get it.

It had it all-evil criminal masterminds concocting clever schemes, dastardly(and beautiful)dames and of course a cacophony of James Bond-like gadgets. The best episodes were the 10 where our heroes, James West and Artemus Gordon, matched wits with Professor Moriarty-ish villian Dr. Miguelito Loveless. The guest star list reads like a who's who of cult '60's icons such as Lloyd Bochner,Kathie Browne and Nick Adams, plus future stars like Katherine Ross and Robert Duvall. The plots are some of the most imaginative ever to grace television. Even though the first season is generally considered the best,there is very little drop off from seasons 1-4. Unfortunately 8 of the 10 Loveless episodes are in seasons 1 and 2. The show probably could have run for several more seasons, but was cancelled due to a crackdown on television violence(perhaps the opening credits montage where the cowboy punches a saloon girl in the face was a clue). As a kid the show was just plain fun to watch and after getting the set my opinion hasn't changed as an adult. Except for a bonus disc of the two WWW TV movies and audio intros from star Robert Conrad in season 1 the rest of the set is devoid of any extra bonus material.

1177203,A34VV0DDR0OFE5,B001CQONOA,K. Rowley,"[143, 157]","I do not like gimmicky packaging - especially when it is prone to damage the discs. This complete set comes in a rather large box - 11"" x 8"" x 2 "". The box itself is pretty heavy duty - reminds me a bit of the candy boxes people like to give. The top of the box has a bit of foam attached to the underside to cushion the contents. The bottom part of the box has a form fitted plastic insert that is frocked with sort of a fake velvet. There are two cavities, holding cardboard sleeves shaped to look either like gun holsters or saddle bags (kind of hard to tell which). There is also a strip of cardboard attached to the plastic insert - printed with the iconic end-of-scene graphics from the show. What disappoints me the most about this set, is the fact that the DVD discs are stacked in these holsters and are only inserted in cardboard sleeve half the size of the actual disc. I randomly pulled out a half-dozen of the discs and a couple of them had visible wear marks from the cardboard. Putting the discs back into their individual slots was somewhat challenging too. It sort of reminds me of the odd packaging that the first & second series of ""Sliders"" came in. I know a bunch of people complained about the use of friction to hold the discs in place and how it tended to scratch the DVDs. I think the same will happen here too. As soon as I can, I will be buying some slim dual disc DVD cases and transferring this set to them.I don't know why these gimmick packaging are made - I recently bought the complete box set for the ""Angel"" series - which was 40 discs. That came in a great package - a cube (5 "" x 5 "" x 6"") which fits on the shelf next to my regular DVD cases. Each season is in its own ""book"" with each disc safely in its own tray.

1177246,A2644B06Y7EQD9,B001CQONOA,R.W.A.,"[1, 1]","First off, I agree with those who have complained about the packaging. Pretty but not workable. Still, all of the discs were in brand-new shape with no evident damage done by the goofy saddlebags. Bought 27 jewel cases and I was good to go. Even adding in the price of the cases, the total cost was still less than had I bought the four seasons individually.This was a nostalgia-driven purchase, to be clear. I didn't buy it for the great writing or acting or set-design. The writing is occasionally clever. The actors all seem to have attended the same school as William Shatner, by which I don't mean they are bad but broad and not at all subtle. And the sets are pretty clearly recycled from episode to episode. All that to say, The Wild Wild West is not The Wire, The Sopranos or Battlestar Galactica (or choose your own example of great television).So, why 5 stars? There's the afore-mentioned nostalgia. Something about the shows of my childhood (Star Trek, The Man From UNCLE, I Spy) continues to resonate. Perhaps it's the naivet&eacute;, the earnestness, the good guys winning and the bad guys losing. There's no ambiguity and there's comfort in that.Jim West and Artemus Gordon are Secret Services agents, assigned by President U. S. Grant to seek out various evils that threaten to destroy the country as we know it, and eliminate them. Along the way Jim wears skin tight pants, walks around without a shirt on, makes out with a beautiful woman (sometimes good, sometimes not so good), engages in fisticuffs, risks his life for the good of the nation, and brings down the bad guy. Artemus, meanwhile, wears disguises, hooks Jim up with Q-like gadgets (Steampunk long before there was Steampunk), and stands by awkwardly while Jim and the damsel smooch. The chemistry between the two leads is warm. They seem to genuinely like each other. And the various villains (admittedly, some are more believable than others) are of the megalomaniacal kind, the most notorious of whom is Miguelito Loveless played by the brilliant Michael Dunn.

I can imagine the frustration of having to pay more plus not getting the two TV movies. I was 11 when the series debuted and it quickly became my favorite show. I only missed one episode(""Night of The Tartar"") in the four year run. Now, that I have the box set, I'll  finally be able to see it. I think I'll wait until 7:30 PM, February 3rd to watch it. It will be 42 years to the hour since the original broadcast.&lt;G> So far, I've watched 44 episodes since I received the box set and I'm very impressed with the video and audio of most of them. They're all good, but most are very crisp and pristine. The '79 TV movie is quite entertaining and the picture quality is excellent. I can't say the same for the '80 movie. It would have to qualify as one of the worst movies ever made, and the video quality pales in comparison with the first film. The Special Features are nothing to get excited about. The best one is Conrad and Martin's appearance on a 1978 talk show. It's a pity that the entire show isn't included. As an original fan, I can remember all the press releases claiming that Robert Conrad did all his own stunts. I'd heard stories down thru the years, that this wasn't the case, and now I know for sure. While he did the vast majority of them, it's quite evident in a few episodes that a stunt double was used.  I especially enjoyed one particular gem from the first season; Dr. Loveless(Michael Dunn) and his partner singing ""Sloop John B."" That was neat! Previous reviewers have complained about the packaging of the discs. While I don't like it,(It's awkward to remove them)if handled with care, I don't think any damage will occur. I was very disappointed to discover that some(if not all) of the episodes are edited.I suspected as much when watching a first season episode. It appeared as if an important scene may have been omitted. After close examination of the very fine print on the box's exterior, my suspicions were confirmed. It's interesting to see how the popularity of the ""Batman"" series influenced some of the episodes in the second season. The criminals were very colorful'comic-book' types.

1177265,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B001CQONOA,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[259, 274]","""The Wild Wild West"" was a terrific show. CBS/Paramount has released the series in this entire season format. The show looks extremely good and the extras (only on season one except for the ""bonus disc"" but we'll get to that in a moment)are good as well. The big issue is the packaging. The box is certainly attractive look but it's basically the size of a board game box. When you open the inside the 27 discs are split into seasons 1 & 2 and 3 & 4 in what appears to be 2 cardboard ""saddle bags"" where they slide into it and are held in place with tiny cardboard inserts. The discs could be pretty easily scratched in this cheap packaging. Whoever designed this should be sent back to design 101--it's clever IF the quality of the materials were good but they're not--and it is a pain if you want to store this with some of your other DVD season sets. The saddle bags are sunk into a plastic older again making it look a bit like a board game (which is perhaps the purpose). There is a strip reprsenting the pix from the opening along the top. There is also a booklet that notes what episodes are on each disc.The ""bonus"" disc has the two TV movies which should have been included as an extra on the fourth season box set (but was withheld so fans would have to double dip to get the two TV movies). Although the box claims they have been digitally restored, they look like simply transfers and while they don't necessarily look bad, they could have used the clean up given to the season sets. There are lots of white streaks and splotches that appear on the first TV movie and the openining 10 or 15 minutes for the 1980 sequel looks WORSE with the image a bit muddy and image quality darker than the 1979 TV movie. I was never a huge fan of the TV movies as they are more in line with ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" the movie starring James Garner. That's because both TV movies were written and directed by the same team who did that movie and ""Support Your Local Gunfighter"". It's nice to see both Robert Conrad and Ross Martin in their roles again but both movies while they have the humor that was characteristic of the series, certainly lack something. The producers must have gotten a bargain on stock footage for nuclear bombs exploding as it appears several times in both TV movies.The first TV movie ""The Wild Wild West Revisited"" features Dr. Loveless' son (played by Paul Williams)planning to take over the world with replicas of the leaders of every major nation in the world. Both West and Gordon are called back retirement to prevent Loveless from using an atomic bomb (or something similar)that he has created planeted in the major nations of each country where he has replaced the leaders.The second TV movie ""More Wild Wild West"" features the duo pulled out of retirement again to prevent Albert Paradine II (Jonathan Winters) from using his invisibility device from taking over the world.Both films have nice supporting casts, some clever gags and nice interplay between Conrad and Martin but are a bit uninspired failing to capture the flavor of the original series at all.I think it stinks that CBS/Paramount chose to release the TV movies only in the ""The Complete Series"" as they rightfully should have been included as part of the second, third or fourth season sets as an extra there. Regardless, my advice is to burn a copy when you're watching it on TV vs. ponying up additional cash for a package that while it looks nice isn't very sturdy.If you haven't purchaed the other season sets this is an affordable one stop shop but the box itself is cumbersome and the materials a bit shoddy in my opinion (although it looks quite nice).",3,"Four stars for all four seasons, 2 stars for the packaging",1226361600,"11 11, 2008",2008,3660,"['Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'was', 'terrific', 'show', 'CBS/Paramount', 'released', 'series', 'entire', 'season', 'format', 'show', 'extremely', 'good', 'extras', 'only', 'season', 'one', 'except', 'bonus', 'disc', ""'ll"", 'get', 'moment', 'are', 'good', 'well', 'big', 'issue', 'packaging', 'box', 'certainly', 'attractive', 'look', 'basically', 'size', 'board', 'game', 'box', 'When', 'open', 'inside', '27', 'discs', 'are', 'split', 'seasons', '1', '2', '3', '4', 'what', 'be', '2', 'cardboard', 'saddle', 'bags', 'where', 'slide', 'are', 'held', 'place', 'tiny', 'cardboard', 'inserts', 'discs', 'could', 'be', 'pretty', 'easily', 'scratched', 'cheap', 'packaging', 'Whoever', 'designed', 'should', 'be', 'sent', 'back', 'design', '101', 'clever', 'IF', 'quality', 'materials', 'were', 'good', ""'re"", 'not', 'pain', 'want', 'store', 'other', 'DVD', 'season', 'sets', 'saddle', 'bags', 'are', 'sunk', 'plastic', 'older', 'again', 'making', 'look', 'bit', 'board', 'game', 'perhaps', 'purpose', 'strip', 'reprsenting', 'pix', 'opening', 'top', 'also', 'booklet', 'what', 'episodes', 'are', 'disc.The', 'bonus', 'disc', 'two', 'TV', 'movies', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'extra', 'fourth', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'withheld', 'so', 'fans', 'would', 'have', 'double', 'dip', 'get', 'two', 'TV', 'movies', 'box', 'have', 'been', 'digitally', 'restored', 'look', 'simply', 'transfers', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'look', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'clean', 'up', 'given', 'season', 'sets', 'are', 'lots', 'white', 'streaks', 'splotches', 'appear', 'first', 'TV', 'movie', 'openining', '10', '15', 'minutes', '1980', 'sequel', 'WORSE', 'image', 'bit', 'muddy', 'image', 'quality', 'darker', '1979', 'TV', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'huge', 'fan', 'TV', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'line', 'Support', 'Your', 'Local', 'Sheriff', 'movie', 'starring', 'James', 'Garner', 'TV', 'movies', 'were', 'written', 'directed', 'same', 'team', 'who', 'did', 'movie', 'Support', 'Your', 'Local', 'Gunfighter', 'nice', 'see', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'Ross', 'Martin', 'roles', 'again', 'movies', 'have', 'humor', 'was', 'characteristic', 'series', 'certainly', 'lack', 'something', 'producers', 'must', 'have', 'gotten', 'bargain', 'stock', 'footage', 'nuclear', 'bombs', 'exploding', 'several', 'times', 'TV', 'movies.The', 'first', 'TV', 'movie', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Revisited', 'features', 'Dr.', 'Loveless', 'son', 'played', 'Paul', 'Williams', 'planning', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'replicas', 'leaders', 'major', 'nation', 'world', 'West', 'Gordon', 'are', 'called', 'back', 'retirement', 'prevent', 'Loveless', 'using', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'something', 'similar', 'created', 'planeted', 'major', 'nations', 'country', 'where', 'replaced', 'leaders.The', 'second', 'TV', 'movie', 'More', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'duo', 'pulled', 'retirement', 'again', 'prevent', 'Albert', 'Paradine', 'II', 'Jonathan', 'Winters', 'using', 'invisibility', 'device', 'taking', 'over', 'world.Both', 'films', 'have', 'nice', 'supporting', 'casts', 'clever', 'gags', 'nice', 'interplay', 'Conrad', 'Martin', 'are', 'bit', 'uninspired', 'failing', 'capture', 'flavor', 'original', 'series', 'all.I', 'think', 'CBS/Paramount', 'chose', 'release', 'TV', 'movies', 'only', 'Complete', 'Series', 'rightfully', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'part', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'season', 'sets', 'extra', 'there', 'Regardless', 'advice', 'burn', 'copy', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'TV', 'vs.', 'ponying', 'up', 'additional', 'cash', 'package', 'nice', ""n't"", 'very', 'sturdy.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'purchaed', 'other', 'season', 'sets', 'affordable', 'one', 'stop', 'shop', 'box', 'cumbersome', 'materials', 'bit', 'shoddy', 'opinion', 'quite', 'nice']",The Wild Wild West: The Complete Series
