Spike Lee must have had a hard time translating the original, brilliant, psychologically disturbing version.  So he decided to ramp up the incest theme, the violence and the gore, all in all reducing it to another sub-par thriller. On a related note, one of the best production elements in the original is a long single take fight scene.  Not content with that, in Lee's version the protagonist (Josh Brolin) beats up five hulking rugby (?) players without breaking a sweat and then takes on about 25 hoodlums at once and puts them all down.  So he has mad skills.  Then when the plot calls for it, a female bodyguard drops him with two moves. Later on two thugs manhandle him without a problem.  What the heck?

1679003,A1WTYK0O1I81Y8,B00GMV8IGO,Chris Moore,"[1, 2]","WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOLIERS (but trust me, that may not be a bad thing).First, I like my movies, regardless of genre, to have at least a modicum of plausibility.  This film's most basic premise stretches that requirement to its outer limits, then fills it in with details that completely overrun its boundaries.  Examples?  Well for starters, there's the idea that one can live in isolation for 20 years without needing either a doctor or a dentist, and that he does not appear to age even a day during that time.  Then there's the idea that he can become a superhuman fighting machine simply by watching kung fu movies on TV and exercising along with Pilates.  When he later gets into fights with entire crowds of evil henchman who each wait their turn to get beat up while dancing around in the background, he is able to take on ten armed guys at once, all while having a large knife thrust deeply into his upper back, and after having been hit multiple times with baseball bats and tire irons.  Sorry, I have my limits to suspending disbelief, and they don't include men around 50 being able to take abuse that would drop a gorilla while defeating several crowds of armed thugs simultaneously.However, the complete stupidity does not end there.  The &#34;hero&#34; manages to brutally kill a couple of dozen people, commits multiple felony assaults, and an armed robbery, yet you never see a single police officer during the entire movie.  Whatever.  But the crowning achievement of the unbelievable is how the villain manages to surveil the hero and his love interest when they shack up at a random hotel room.  Somehow, the bad guy was able to predict not only which hotel they would go to, but even which room they would use, and was able to set up a pretty elaborate monitoring system in that room - all in the space of just a couple of hours.  Pretty amazing, er, I mean, impossible.Second, as mentioned, the entire plot of the movie is not only flawed and extremely unlikely/unrealistic, but it is also unnecessarily depraved and disgusting.  This is one of those things where I felt dirty after having watched it.  (HERE COMES THE BIGGEST SPOILER, READ FURTHER AT YOUR OWN PERIL).  The &#34;hero&#34; is an unlikeable meat head who I could never get myself to care about, but the villain is an over the top kind of cheesy bad, complete with a smug, effeminate, pseudo-European accent and homosexual/incestuous/pedophilic obsessions.  And, of course, the whole movie is about the villain getting revenge against the &#34;hero&#34; for discovering and exposing his incestuous, pedophile father and &#34;ruining&#34; the beautiful thing he and his sister had with billionaire daddy.  So he spends fortunes capturing all of his former classmates who teased him when daddy was caught having sex with his freshman sister, only to then turn around and frame them for the murder of their wives, and place their children with adoptive couples so he could manipulate their upbringing and trick their natural fathers into later having sex with their daughters while he watches.  I know, great movie.But the absolute worst part is when the &#34;hero&#34; finds out that he unknowingly had sex with his daughter, he suddenly grovels before the villain crying, and begging like a slobbering idiot to be killed.  Literally, he goes from super bad ass, to a pathetic mess in the space of half a second.

We all know there's no comparison; the original OLDBOY was like a putrid blast in the face, a sucker punch to the groin.  This is a different film; yes, an American remake of an Asian cult film.  It happens.  Move on and appreciate it for what it has to offer on its own.Compare OLDBOY, instead, to the typical Hollywood fare, to the thrillers that promise something more and then don't really deliver (I'm looking at you, GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO remake).  Lee's film has a few punches that you don't see; it has an ending you wouldn't find in another film.  It has a protagonist, perfectly embodied by Josh Brolin, who stars as an unlikable schmuck: an alcoholic ad exec (as apparently they all are), who loses a big deal.  Then he disappears.  For twenty years, locked alone in a room, going crazy, then finding purpose: get out, see his daughter, clear himself in the murder of his wife, and get revenge.Except suddenly, just as he's planning to escape...he's set free.  He quickly finds a social worker and an old friend willing to help him in his cause, just as things become more tangled.  This is the point where any other conventional film would crumble; Lee manages to keep things together, stay on target, and deliver a couple of decently low blows.  Through it all, Brolin remains game; he gives a truly memorable performance, plunging into depths of despair, rage, and unexpected tenderness.  Sharlto Copley, in his brief role, is delectably menacing.  Elizabeth Olsen is merely along for the ride in a thankless supporting turn.  The script is solid; it offers a nice take on the original, updating it a bit and, yes, Americanizing it.  That's where OLDBOY hits its speed bumps; at times, Lee goes out of his way to remind you that you're watching a remake, the sort of wink-and-nod thing you should leave for press interviews.Still, don't go into this film with false expectations.  It's good.  It's not great, not like Chan-wook Park's grotesque masterpiece, but it's worth the experience.  If you've seen the original, then come in with an open mind, ready to interpret this film on its own grounds.  If you haven't seen the original...then be forewarned: this isn't your typical Hollywood thriller.

1679010,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00GMV8IGO,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","Not too long ago a Spike Lee film was an event.  Pictures like ""Do the Right Thing"", ""Jungle Fever"", and ""Malcolm X"" stirred the national debate on the state of the African-American union in the U.S.  Other films like ""Clockers"", ""Bamboozled"", and ""Summer of Sam"" didn't achieve those lofty heights but were provocative nonetheless.  Recently Lee has been flying under the radar with his  work and he's not the cause celebre that he once was.  This remake of a cult Korean film from ten years ago is an interesting departure for Lee.  Ironically the original was championed by Quentin Tarantino, a long time verbal sparring partner of Lee's.  The basic plot of the first film is essentially retained but Lee adds new elements to differentiate the two.  I like how Lee fleshes out the title character played by Josh Brolin.  There are also new plot threads that even if you saw the initial film you will still be in suspense by the end of the film.  Speaking of Brolin he is terrific as Joe Doucett, the drunken adman imprisoned for twenty years in a motel room for a crime or offense he can't remember committing.  Here Brolin displays the requisite range to broadly play the lout and eventually evolving into a sober father bent on revenge.  Not to suggest that this film is on the same level but there are remnants of Robert Towne's script for ""Chinatown"" on display.  The squeamish should be forewarned that there is a lot of brutal violence and thematic elements that may repulse.  Those looking for a good thriller this is almost as good as it gets.

There are all sorts of themes here; unlike many of its sort, however, OLDBOY does not get so bogged-down in its own ideas that it interferes with the basic suspense of the film. Lots of gore, violence, and sex/nudity, but it never becomes truly tasteless. WARNING: While I don't want to give away the specifics, the big ""twist"" at the end is shocking stuff that's obviously offended a number of folks. Still, it's not presented in the gratuitous in-yr-face fashion that it might have been and makes for a truly impactful element of surprise.On the other hand, certain plot-details don't make a whole lot of sense, and I'm not sure that they are supposed to, so in that respect, OLDBOY suffers from some lazy production and direction. Nevertheless, it has a very original overall plot with elements of solipsism and quasi-fantasy, all presented in plainly realistic, easy-to-follow fashion. The blank and fuzzy spots should not be completely ruinous if you aren't too demanding. The quality of the acting and filming is generally good if not especially great. Still, Michael Imperioli and Elizabeth Olsen (ofMartha Marcy May Marlenefame) both give strong performances.Watching OLDBOY, I was completely unaware that it's a remake of a 2003 Korean production by the same title, and there is an overwhelming consensus among the more critical reviewers that this version is quite inferior to the original, which is so often the case.

Spike Lee must have gone brain dead during the remake because this shows none of what has made him such an insightful director over the years.Here's the scoop. Josh Brolin plays an advertising exec who is self absorbed, a cad, a poor father with a divorced wife. He drinks to excess and is generally a screw-up. He gets kidnapped and is held prisoner for 20 years then inexplicably released with a new suit and a pocketful of money. He sets out to find his captor and exact revenge.This starts out really well. You get a good sense of Brolin's character. He IS a bad guy who gets really scary when he gets drunk. Like a bomb that might or might not go off. Then there's the incarceration. Again Brolin does a good job. His gradual realization of the fact he cannot escape and how he deals with it are as smooth as silk. Then, when he's released those next few scenes are still Okay. But from there it goes downhill fast and steep. I put the stink factor on the script. Spike knows where to put the camera and get things moving within the frame. But too many things, like Brolin's escalating relationship with Marie (Elizabeth Olsen) just doesn't work. You don't feel it, so, when the big punchline comes, it borders on ridiculous. hen there's the back story which IS the reason for the whole film. This is rushed, so it too has nowhere near the impact needed to warrant what is happening.Brolin's performance is good given what he ad to work with. Olsen is good enough but her part is underwritten. Copley never found the right notes for his character and Sam Jackson muscles his way through a comic book role.Nearly everything that made the original so good is absent hear.

The story here is a bit muddled and at times falls into a &#34;kill bill-esque&#34; feel with its fight sequences that seem almost silly.  The first half of the movie where he is stuck inside the room is slow and lacking much character development or any type of exploration into madness like one would expect from someone stuck 20 years.  Brolin is ok as Joe and Samuel Jackson does well as the eccentric type characters that he plays frequently but Jackson's character almost seems out of place here.The movie was watchable but I just felt that it was missing something that original seemed to have.

This despite the fact that I'm also a fan of Josh Brolin.Let's get it out of the way. This remake is not nearly the stunning achievement of the original - the Korean actors, the direction, the sets, the cinematography, and soundtrack were all superior in every single way to this remake. Honestly, how creative can one claim to be tracing another artist's work?So where does it leave this movie?Actually... not bad.I was taken aback by how decent this flick actually is, all things considered. And believe me, there were quite a few considerations.It must be an interesting experience for those viewers who did not screen the original, and more importantly, did not know the twist shocker which stunned audiences back in 2003.Was the impact for the ending of the remake as powerful? As upsetting?For me, screening the Korean original was an experience that is difficult to put into words. Certainly 'amazing' comes to mind, 'stunning' for sure, and 'perverse' without a doubt.This Americanized effort did a decent job of conveying those emotions - but with less impact. It's sort of like sipping a cool soft drink where all the ice has melted. The flavors are there, but the intensity is not. Essentially, a diluted product. Director Spike Lee, with his usual track record, once again underdelivered - particularly in the casting department. Several of the key players, save stars Brolin and Olsen, struck me as second tier thespians. Many scenes were very thin, the acting superficial and tinny.And Lee really needs some kind of primer on how to do large scale fight scenes. Gads, those were just awful! Fake and overly staged. Such a disappointment. &lt;smdh>Yet, what really annoyed was the opening sequence. How difficult is it to show the passage of time? To expose the anxiety and horror of discovering you're imprisoned for reasons you cannot explain and with no recourse to appeal. Made even more horrific since you're allowed zero interaction with another human being for *twenty years*. Apparently very difficult - as evidenced by the remake.I will admit that there was one aspect I enjoyed - the one improvement I thought Lee accomplished over the original. The ending. It seemed somehow more appropriate. A life sentence for his crime, intentional or not, to recognize and admit that he still owed a debt that had to be paid. A nice touch.Again, given this is an inferior remake - not bad. Saved by the solid performances of Josh Brolin and Elizabeth Olsen.Personal Note:- There was indeed a stunning revelation for me, but it wasn't experienced thru the film.Was gobsmacked to learn that Ms. Olsen is related to those two twins. Yikes.For her own sake, both professionally and personally, she should keep her locks auburn or brunette.",3,Sort Of Like When Ice Melts Into Your Soft Drink,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,2966,"['***Spoiler', 'Warning***Interesting.Went', 'fairly', 'jaded', 'perspective', ""'m"", 'monster', 'fan', 'original', 'Korean', 'film.Having', 'steadied', 'dislike', 'remake', 'was', 'prepped', 'write', 'scathing', 'review', 'fact', ""'m"", 'also', 'fan', 'Josh', 'Brolin.Let', 'get', 'way', 'remake', 'not', 'nearly', 'stunning', 'achievement', 'original', 'Korean', 'actors', 'direction', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'soundtrack', 'were', 'superior', 'single', 'way', 'remake', 'Honestly', 'how', 'creative', 'can', 'one', 'claim', 'be', 'tracing', 'artist', 'work', 'So', 'where', 'leave', 'movie', 'Actually', 'not', 'bad.I', 'was', 'taken', 'aback', 'how', 'decent', 'flick', 'actually', 'things', 'considered', 'believe', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'considerations.It', 'must', 'be', 'interesting', 'experience', 'viewers', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'screen', 'original', 'more', 'importantly', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'twist', 'shocker', 'stunned', 'audiences', 'back', '2003.Was', 'impact', 'ending', 'remake', 'powerful', 'upsetting', 'screening', 'Korean', 'original', 'was', 'experience', 'difficult', 'put', 'words', 'Certainly', ""'amazing"", 'mind', ""'stunning"", 'sure', 'doubt.This', 'Americanized', 'effort', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'conveying', 'emotions', 'less', 'impact', 'sort', 'sipping', 'cool', 'soft', 'drink', 'where', 'ice', 'melted', 'flavors', 'are', 'there', 'intensity', 'not', 'Essentially', 'diluted', 'product', 'Director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'usual', 'track', 'record', 'once', 'again', 'underdelivered', 'particularly', 'casting', 'department', 'Several', 'key', 'players', 'save', 'stars', 'Brolin', 'Olsen', 'struck', 'second', 'tier', 'thespians', 'Many', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'thin', 'acting', 'superficial', 'tinny.And', 'Lee', 'really', 'kind', 'primer', 'how', 'do', 'large', 'scale', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Gads', 'were', 'just', 'awful', 'Fake', 'overly', 'staged', 'disappointment', 'lt', '>', 'Yet', 'what', 'really', 'annoyed', 'was', 'opening', 'sequence', 'How', 'difficult', 'show', 'passage', 'time', 'expose', 'anxiety', 'horror', 'discovering', ""'re"", 'imprisoned', 'reasons', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'recourse', 'appeal', 'Made', 'even', 'more', 'horrific', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'zero', 'interaction', 'human', 'being', '*twenty', 'years*', 'Apparently', 'very', 'difficult', 'evidenced', 'remake.I', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'one', 'aspect', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'improvement', 'thought', 'Lee', 'accomplished', 'original', 'ending', 'seemed', 'somehow', 'more', 'appropriate', 'life', 'sentence', 'crime', 'intentional', 'not', 'recognize', 'admit', 'still', 'owed', 'debt', 'had', 'be', 'paid', 'nice', 'touch.Again', 'given', 'inferior', 'remake', 'not', 'bad', 'Saved', 'solid', 'performances', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Elizabeth', 'Olsen.Personal', 'Note', 'was', 'indeed', 'stunning', 'revelation', 'was', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'thru', 'film.Was', 'gobsmacked', 'learn', 'Ms.', 'Olsen', 'related', 'two', 'twins', 'Yikes.For', 'own', 'sake', 'professionally', 'personally', 'should', 'keep', 'locks', 'auburn', 'brunette']",N/A

1679045,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00GMV8IGO,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","While most critics love Spike Lee I've never been a huge fan. Sure he's done some movies that I've thought were good but too often I found his films too filled with political correctness and outrage. That's fine when you start but after so many films it becomes less a statement of honesty and more one of trying to keep your following happy. The films I have enjoyed have been his more mainstream films. This week finds one of those released on DVD though mainstream might not quite be the word I'd use to describe it.OLDBOY was a Korean made film that took audiences by surprise and by storm when it was originally released back in 2003. It was controversial and filled with extreme violence and yet it told a fascinating story. Lee has taken that original film and made it more palatable for U.S. audiences, those who still refuse to read subtitles.Josh Brolin is Joe Doucett, an ad exec who's seen better days. Now Joe he weighs too much, drinks too much, flirts too much and tends to forget about the family he once had. After losing an important client he goes on a binge only to wake and find himself locked in a strange room with no way out. The sparse room has a bed, nightstand, huge TV screen, a false window and a bathroom. Cries for help or to know what's going on go unanswered.By watching the TV, Joe also learns that his wife has been raped and murdered and that his daughter has been taken in child protective services. He also finds out that the police think he's the one who did this with DNA evidence to back it up. He is supplied with plenty to eat (if he'll eat Chinese food) and an endless supply of whiskey which he takes to rapidly. The only programs on his TV screen are news, exercise programs, kung fu movies and updates on the life of his daughter now being raised by an adoptive couple.Time moves forward and first Joe feels helpless and then tries to take his own life. But the forces that be won't allow that, knocking him out with gas and then bandaging him up. Knowing that he'll survive no matter what he does, he decides to make the best of things. He stops drinking and begins to work out since most of the TV programming is exercise shows and kung fu movies. As the years go by, Joe begins to work on a way to escape, finding some lose tiles in the shower. But before he can use this escape, he is knocked out once again.When Joe wakes, he finds himself in a steamer trunk in the middle of a field with a cell phone and plenty of money. It is now 20 years later and he still has no clue who did this to him or why. But he sees a woman carrying an umbrella with a symbol he recognizes as one he tattooed onto his own arm.  Following her he ends up in an altercation with a group of weekend sports players that he takes out easily using the things he's learned watching the TV. He loses the girl but does find an old friend named Chucky (Michael Imperoli). With his help Joe learns how to use a computer as well as the internet.As Joe continues to search for whoever is behind this he meets a young woman who helps with the less fortunate in the neighborhood named Marie (Elizabeth Olson). Along with his friend Chucky, they continue to try and find answers to help him. Various clues are left for Joe to help him move this direction or that and eventually he is brought face to face with the person responsible. And he still has no idea who this is or why any of this has taken place.That might seem like a lot of information but trust me when I say that things go forward from here that make all of it not only clear as to what was going on but why. Through it Joe faces off against enormous odds in a fight sequence that isn't exactly what the original presented but close enough that fans should be pleased. Lee has also decided to keep the ending somewhat intact, something that will shock many, disgust a few and surprise only those with no contact with the original film.This move is so well paced, so well put together that there isn't a moment when you'll consider touching the remote to fast forward. You'll want to absorb not only every ounce of information in the hopes of putting the story together but you won't want to miss any of the fine quality acting on display from every single person involved. Why Brolin isn't doing more in movies is beyond me and Olsen shows that in that family she was the one gifted with acting ability.OLDBOY is not for the weak of heart. It offers a gritty world where bad things happen to bad people and where justice takes on the oddest form. If the end of this movie doesn't make your draw drop then you weren't paying attention.

The pacing is good and what otherwise could be a slow moving film.,4,Much better than advertised,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,142,"['Folks', 'blasted', 'Spike', 'Lee', 're-making', 'Korean', 'film', 'off', 'pacing', 'good', 'what', 'otherwise', 'could', 'be', 'slow', 'moving', 'film']",N/A
1679047,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00GMV8IGO,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","While I am aware of the original Korean film, I have never seen it.  I was actually going to watch it first but due to circumstances this one came to me first.  Skimming over a dozen or so reviews of the movie, the general conclusion is that it doesn't hold up to the original.  Since I knew little about either film, I didn't feel prejudiced either way.The premise is pretty interesting.  Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) is a jerk.  He's a womanizing misogynist whose wife kicks him out because of his ""wanderings"" and alcoholism.  Leaving his wife and young daughter, he finds himself waking in a hotel-like room after a drunken escapade.  The room has a TV (of sorts), a bathroom, and some books; and he is regularly given food through an opening in the locked door.  He has no way to communicate and stays in this solitary confinement for 20 years.For reasons he doesn't understand, he is suddenly released, finding himself in a vast field.  He has some money left on him by his unknown captor and vows to find out what happened.  Director Spike Lee has a good handle on this first act.  Neither Joe nor the audience know exactly what's going on.  During his search, Joe follows an umbrella he had seen earlier upon his release.  This leads him to a medical clinic and one of the aides, Marie (Elizabeth Olsen).  She stumbles upon him later and eventually agrees to help him find out what happened to those 20 years.As Joe gets closer to the bad guys including his jailer (Samuel L. Jackson) and his boss (Sharlto Copley) things get a bit ridiculous.  We also get a look at a lot of questions which are never answered.  Lee invokes his Korean film knowledge during this middle section as Joe has to take on countless thugs schooled in the martial arts.  Joe has learned a few tricks himself watching all that do-it-yourself training during his captivity.  Although he had no chance to try it out on a real training partner, he has no problem eviscerating any and all who try to stop him.  Silly when you think about it.When the evil Adrian (Copley) kidnaps Joe's now grown daughter, he agrees to release her and make Joe's life whole again if he can figure out why he was imprisoned.  Marie and Joe go back in time trying to solve the puzzle, providing a not-for-the-squeamish concluding act.  The film is ultra-violent which of course is not unusual for American or Korean films.  I will admit I like the mystery solving component in the movie and the fight scenes are choreographed just fine.  I just thought too much of the film was unrealistic to a fault.  It's a movie that relies on too many coincidences in the plot to make the story work.The Blu ray version of the film comes in 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  While I have some reservations about the film, I have none about the transfer.  It is first rate.  Most of the film is shot in low light and yet the scenes are clear and sharp.  Colors are excellent if rare.  Scenes in Chinatown feature robust reds and orange.  I found no issues with grit, blemishes or other abnormalities.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is likewise excellent.  What I recall mostly is clear and distinct dialog.  Surrounds come into play with the musical soundtrack and some street life.  Excellent throughout.  There is an English SDH track but no other subtitle options.  Extras include extended and alternate scenes, a ""making of"" segment, some previews, a couple short casting pieces and a digital copy.",3,(BLU RAY REVIEW) Spike Lee remakes a cult favorite,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,3473,"['am', 'aware', 'original', 'Korean', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'watch', 'first', 'due', 'circumstances', 'one', 'came', 'first', 'Skimming', 'dozen', 'so', 'reviews', 'movie', 'general', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'original', 'knew', 'little', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'prejudiced', 'way.The', 'premise', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'Joe', 'Doucett', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'jerk', 'womanizing', 'misogynist', 'wife', 'out', 'wanderings', 'alcoholism', 'Leaving', 'wife', 'young', 'daughter', 'waking', 'hotel-like', 'room', 'drunken', 'escapade', 'room', 'TV', 'sorts', 'bathroom', 'books', 'regularly', 'given', 'food', 'opening', 'locked', 'door', 'way', 'communicate', 'stays', 'solitary', 'confinement', '20', 'years.For', 'reasons', ""n't"", 'understand', 'suddenly', 'released', 'finding', 'vast', 'field', 'money', 'left', 'unknown', 'captor', 'vows', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'good', 'handle', 'first', 'act', 'Joe', 'audience', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'search', 'Joe', 'umbrella', 'had', 'seen', 'earlier', 'release', 'medical', 'clinic', 'one', 'aides', 'Marie', 'Elizabeth', 'Olsen', 'later', 'eventually', 'help', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', '20', 'years.As', 'Joe', 'closer', 'bad', 'guys', 'including', 'jailer', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'boss', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'also', 'get', 'look', 'lot', 'questions', 'are', 'never', 'answered', 'Lee', 'Korean', 'film', 'knowledge', 'middle', 'section', 'Joe', 'take', 'countless', 'thugs', 'schooled', 'martial', 'arts', 'Joe', 'learned', 'few', 'tricks', 'watching', 'do-it-yourself', 'training', 'captivity', 'had', 'chance', 'try', 'out', 'real', 'training', 'partner', 'problem', 'eviscerating', 'who', 'try', 'stop', 'Silly', 'when', 'think', 'it.When', 'evil', 'Adrian', 'Copley', 'Joe', 'now', 'grown', 'daughter', 'release', 'make', 'Joe', 'life', 'whole', 'again', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'Marie', 'Joe', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'trying', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'providing', 'not-for-the-squeamish', 'concluding', 'act', 'film', 'ultra-violent', 'course', 'not', 'unusual', 'American', 'Korean', 'films', 'will', 'admit', 'mystery', 'solving', 'component', 'movie', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'choreographed', 'just', 'fine', 'just', 'thought', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'fault', 'movie', 'too', 'many', 'coincidences', 'plot', 'make', 'story', 'work.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', 'film', '1080p', 'video', 'resolution', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'have', 'reservations', 'film', 'have', 'none', 'transfer', 'first', 'rate', 'Most', 'film', 'shot', 'low', 'light', 'yet', 'scenes', 'are', 'clear', 'sharp', 'Colors', 'are', 'excellent', 'rare', 'Scenes', 'Chinatown', 'feature', 'robust', 'reds', 'orange', 'found', 'issues', 'grit', 'blemishes', 'other', 'abnormalities', 'audio', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'likewise', 'excellent', 'What', 'recall', 'mostly', 'clear', 'distinct', 'dialog', 'come', 'play', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'street', 'life', 'Excellent', 'English', 'SDH', 'track', 'other', 'subtitle', 'options', 'Extras', 'include', 'extended', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'making', 'segment', 'previews', 'couple', 'short', 'casting', 'pieces', 'digital', 'copy']",N/A

1679059,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B00GMV8IGO,Robert Hayes,"[4, 6]","Spike Lee's OLDBOY is the remake (really, one of many) that never should have been made. It does add some more character development for the main character (here renamed Joe Doucette), but the movie essentially unfolds the exact same way as the original. Granted, you have Samuel L. Jackson as a colorful personality who runs a rather sadistic business, but it's almost like he's in a different movie and his part of the story doesn't really add anything fresh to the proceedings. If anything, it's a bunch of unnecessary explanation for events that occurred in the original. Still, once Joe gets out of his room the movie is a somewhat interesting mystery, even if the questions are still the same. Sharlto Copley does a serviceable job as a villain with more than a few idiosyncrasies, personality quirks and secrets, but the denouement to the story is botched largely due to him. If the movie was passable up until the third act, the ending undoes any goodwill there might have been. Instead of the sheer nihilism of the Chan-Wook Park's original, Spike Lee decided to go for something more bittersweet and, quite frankly, sappy. Fans of the original won't like it, and I'd be hard-pressed to find anyone not familiar with the original who will like this either.

1679069,A1C7CXDWY1BWW0,B00GMV8IGO,Tim Colles,"[0, 0]","Generally, this movie gets a limp thumb sort of up. It's OK...if you never see the original Korean masterpiece. By comparison, this film lacks the explosive edge of the lead performance by Choi Min-Sik, Korea's answer to Liam Neeson(or any number of actors who are NOT Josh Brolin). The plot machinations are more ably laid out by Park Chan-Wook, with the passage of time painstakingly played out. A sense of grueling monotony and the character's perplexed reaction, his stamina, his aging seem to come alive- Spike Lee's layout of the plot seems more shorthand, a mere sketchy montage, a rudimentary set-up that robs us of a connection with what it feels like to fall down a rabbit hole.A shocking truth, the seed from which grew a desire to enact revenge , is different. In this film, the bad guy seems connected to the sad truth more through a third party. In the Korean film, destructive  gossip springs from a more intimate connection and his sister's death springs directly from the cruelty of her schoolmates. The difference between these two stories is the difference between a melodramatic potboiler and Greek tragedy.Stylistically, this film does not utilize set design to any great effect. Neither the room of imprisonment nor the villain's apartment become much more than just a couple of places that ""things happen"". The Korean film gives life to both sets. The room is more than just a room. It is an enemy of sanity, an entity that traps and spies on and twists Oh Dae-su inside-out. The glossy, high-tech apartment becomes an extension of a villainous revenge, a fishbowl of life lived along a razor's edge.Elizabeth Olsen, a future Oscar-winner, could ably have given the love story a much needed charge but an inadequate script kills any real emotion. What a waste of a superb actress.This is a student's effort to copy, but not steal, a true original piece of cinematic achievement. All the script changes fall flat. The visuals underwhelm. Everything that made the original great is missing. Spike Lee wasted his time and ours, because there is no way to improve on this classic.Rent the original and be mesmerized.

1679070,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B00GMV8IGO,Tom Birkenstock,"[1, 2]","Hollywood has been threatening to remake Oldboy for some time now.  At one point Stephen Spielberg and Will Smith were supposed to team up and tackle the Korean revenge drama, which suggested to many that any American remake of Oldboy would be a watered down remake of Oldboy.  But I don&#8217;t think anyone suspected that Spike Lee would be tapped to helm the American version of the cult classic.  Like others, I love Lee&#8217;s work because he is such an idiosyncratic auteur, capable of plastering all of his thoughts, concerns and fears across a movie screen.  The idea of Lee working on what is essentially a genre exercise seemed counterintuitive, but it was also the incongruous meeting of director and film that made me interested in an American version of Oldboy a decade after the release of the original.  If nothing else, Lee&#8217;s Oldboy shows people that he can deliver the goods when it comes to blood, guts and action.  If he didn&#8217;t have so much to say, Lee could have been a damn good director for hire.Of course, I was never a huge fan of the original film, and I think Chan-wook Park has made better movies, but over the years I&#8217;ve come to appreciate the movie as a collection of bizarre and engaging images.  For me, the original never coheres as a whole, but it is a great series of disconnected segments.  Lee&#8217;s remake stays relatively true to the broad outlines of the original&#8217;s plot.  And while in interviews Lee is quick to stress that he thinks of the film as a &#8220;reimagining&#8221; rather than a remake, his film is a lot more faithful than that word suggests.  If nothing else, the 2013 version of Oldboy is an interesting genre exercise that is likely to be just as shocking as the original to the uninitiated but probably only an odd curiosity for those of us who caught the first film ten years ago.For those who haven&#8217;t seen Park&#8217;s film, the protagonist of Oldboy, in this version named Joe Doucett, is an overworked businessman.  Early in the film we see Joe not so clandestinely take a few chugs of vodka out of one of those flask sized containers, made for those who are committed to being day drunk on a semi-regular basis but don&#8217;t want to go all the way and buy an actual flask.  Later Joe blows up at his ex-wife after she suggests that he show up for his daughter&#8217;s third birthday, and then proceeds to clown his own business dinner by hitting on a prospective client&#8217;s date.  Lee&#8217;s version paints a far more desperate and depraved image of its protagonist as a member of the corporate good ol&#8217; boys club.  While some might take issue with this change, complaining that Joe&#8217;s eventual entrapment seems more justified in the remake, it does add another layer to Joe&#8217;s determination to get revenge.  Tracking down those who imprisoned him seems as much about making amends for who he was as it is about plain old vengeance.After a major bender that finds him yelling in the middle of the street and vomiting on the sidewalk, Joe wakes up in an unsettling hotel room with little more than a television, creepy photo of a bellboy, and an adjacent bathroom.  Joe&#8217;s captors provide him daily meals every day, including a small container of vodka and the ever present dumplings from the original film.  Here Joe spends the next twenty years of his life, barely holding on to his insanity.  Lee actually extends this portion of the film, and he arguably improves on the original by including little details like Joe&#8217;s attempt to befriend a mouse and her brood.  Like much of the film, the sequence is born on the shoulders of Josh Brolin&#8217;s surprisingly engaging performance, which spans the gamut from confusion to rage to debased desperation.Joe does eventually get out, but instead of following through on an escape plan he has conjured, he is unceremoniously released.  From here, Joe starts to plot his revenge with the aid of an old friend played by Michael Imperioli (a Spike Lee regular) and a young medical assistant played by Elizabeth Olsen.  The remake follows the guideline of the original, and if anything it actually spends more time wallowing in the Grand Guignol twists this time around, perhaps as a rejoinder to those who believed an American remake wouldn&#8217;t have the guts to follow through with some of the more revolting aspects of the first movie.  Lee evinces a clear love of Park&#8217;s film, and there are a handful of visual allusions throughout the film, which seem to pierce the thin membrane separating the original and the remake.As always, Lee brings his consummate visual eye to the proceedings, and he often garnishes his dark and seedy cityscapes with bright flashes of color.  He even films the action with aplomb, besting other directors who supposedly direct action movies as a career.  (Rumor has it that Lee filmed an even longer version of the single shot hammer sequence, but that the studio forced him to cut it down, perhaps the only real concession to American audiences in the film).  And as I mentioned, Brolin&#8217;s varied performance carries the film along with the same magnetic pull as one of Lee&#8217;s double dolly shots.  In all the film is well made.  I&#8217;m just not completely certain it&#8217;s a necessary film.  The 2013 Oldboy is like a good cover of a song that stays pretty close to the original.  The new band knows what made the song great in the first place, and they dutifully reproduce that.  But in the end those who love the original will always prefer listening to the original.",3,A Remake without a Clear Reason to Exist,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,5599,"['Hollywood', 'been',

One night after drinking too much he wakes up in what he thinks is a hotel room. When he realizes that he is a captive and has been framed for his wife's murder he wonders why and who did this too him. Twenty years later he is released and sets out on his quest for answers and revenge. I recently watched the original and I have to say that one was very good but very graphic and had ideas that I was interested to see how it would translate in the US version. This one for the most part stayed pretty true to the original but it was very toned down in terms of the violence it showed. The main difference I couldn't look past between the two versions was that this one came off as very flat. The original had a quality to it that while graphic and shocking made you care about what was going on. This one seemed to lack all of that and I think because it was &#34;American-ized&#34; too much. Even the twist seemed to lack the impact of the original, but I think that may have been because I knew it was coming. Overall, not as good as the original. This one just felt flat.

1679074,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00GMV8IGO,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Remaking a cult classic is not an easy task, especially when the original&#8217;s story has its roots in a different culture. Spike Lee&#8217;s &#8220;Oldboy&#8221; (2013) is a remake of a Korean cult classic of the same title (2003) directed by Park Chan-wook, which is inspired by a Japanese comic &#8220;Old Boy&#8221; by Garon Tsuchiya and Nobuaki Minegishi. (Interestingly, the comic has a different storyline.) So, how can you transplant this story of a vengeful man into a different culture?Director Spike Lee and writer Mark Protosevich took the safest course: changing a bit, but not really much. Josh Brolin is Joe Doucett, an alcoholic advertising executive, who, after being confined in a room for twenty years, is freed. Joe sets out to find out who is responsible for his imprisonment, with a help from a nurse named Marie (Elizabeth Olsen).While the remake manages to entertain (and shock) in its own way, it lacks the emotional intensity that this kind of story should have. In short, despite the effectively tense performance from Brolin, we really don&#8217;t care much about his journey into darkness. Characters say what they say, but their words (especially those of Sharlto Copley as &#8220;The Stranger&#8221;) do not capture their emotion. The film explains their motives, but not to any depth.Perhaps only in Eastern culture the story of &#8220;Oldboy&#8221; is possible. Actors are doing their best trying to do the famous &#8220;hammer fight&#8221; sequence, one of the highlights of the original, but somehow it looks too slick and clean (and why don&#8217;t they just shoot the guy in the first place?).Reportedly there is a longer version of the film, so maybe we should wait for that, though we are not sure if it will be available. As to the present version of &#8220;Oldboy&#8221; it only proves once again that some films don't need to be remade.",3,"So, Why Remaking This Cult Classic ...",1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,1880,"['Remaking', 'cult', 'classic', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'especially', 'when', 'original', '8217', 's', 'story', 'roots', 'different', 'culture', 'Spike', 'Lee', '8217', '8220', 'Oldboy', '8221', '2013', 'remake', 'Korean', 'cult', 'classic', 'same', 'title', '2003', 'directed', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', 'inspired', 'Japanese', 'comic', '8220', 'Old', 'Boy', '8221', 'Garon', 'Tsuchiya', 'Nobuaki', 'Minegishi', 'Interestingly', 'comic', 'different', 'storyline', 'So', 'how', 'can', 'transplant', 'story', 'vengeful', 'man', 'different', 'culture', 'Director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'writer', 'Mark', 'Protosevich', 'took', 'safest', 'course', 'changing', 'bit', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Joe', 'Doucett', 'alcoholic', 'advertising', 'executive', 'who', 'being', 'confined', 'room', 'twenty', 'years', 'freed', 'Joe', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'responsible', 'imprisonment', 'help', 'nurse', 'named', 'Marie', 'Elizabeth', 'Olsen', 'remake', 'entertain', 'shock', 'own', 'way', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'kind', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'short', 'effectively', 'tense', 'performance', 'Brolin', 'really', 'don', '8217', 'care', 'much', 'journey', 'darkness', 'Characters', 'say', 'what', 'say', 'words', 'especially', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', '8220', 'Stranger', '8221', 'do', 'not', 'capture', 'emotion', 'film', 'motives', 'not', 'depth.Perhaps', 'only', 'Eastern', 'culture', 'story', '8220', 'Oldboy', '8221', 'possible', 'Actors', 'are', 'doing', 'best', 'trying', 'do', 'famous', '8220', 'hammer', 'fight', '8221', 'sequence', 'one', 'highlights', 'original', 'somehow', 'too', 'slick', 'clean', 'why', 'don', '8217', 'just', 'shoot', 'guy', 'first', 'place', '.Reportedly', 'longer', 'version', 'film', 'so', 'maybe', 'should', 'wait', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'present', 'version', '8220', 'Oldboy', '8221', 'only', 'once', 'again', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'remade']",N/A
