She was dancing right along with the music throughout almost every song, and especially loved to &#8220;do the skeleton&#8221; &#8211; I was even able to get her dancing to it on video &#8220;doing the owl&#8221; and shared the fun with our whole family. This will be watched again and again this week as Halloween keeps getting closer! We get requests for &#8220;Halloween wiggles&#8221; almost every day. I THINK she is a little excited.

We are quite pleased this year to add the newest Wiggles DVD ""Wiggly Halloween"" to our collection of must watch in October! My kids have long been Wiggle fans (practically since birth... my daughter 5 1/2 years and my son nearly 3!) so they were pretty excited about this DVD!On the Wiggly Halloween DVD there are twenty Halloween inspired songs. My kids favorites were Skeleton Scat, Three Little Pumpkins, Zombie Feet, & Trick or Treat. Most of the songs are upbeat, catchy, and a lot fun. I appreciate the fun approach instead of spooky and scary take on the holiday. This DVD I'm sure will help kids transition into the holiday be prepared for whatever they might see knowing that it's all in good fun.I will have to say I disliked the Little Vampire Song on the DVD. The song is about little vampires that prefer Cranberry juice over blood. But the the lyrics bug me (I want to suck the cranberry juice now now now. ). My little one has been repeating partial lyrics after hearing the song and that can be taken in a bad way. I also didn't think the song Who Killed Cock Robin belonged on a DVD for kids. I'd think it'd confuse kids about death and murder and it just seems an odd addition to the collection. A few of the songs seemed just out of place but overall not a bad addition to our Wiggles collection.Bonus features include ""Ready, Steady, Wiggle! Tv series episode - Twinkle, Twinkle!"" & a photo gallery of all The Wiggles Characters. My kids liked the bonuses and I was a fan of the Jukebox feature where I could go pick which song I wanted played instead of needing to watch the DVD all the way through, especially since there will be some songs I'll be skipping over.",4,A Few Out of place Songs...,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,1817,"['are', 'getting', 'geared', 'up', 'Halloween', 'house', 'crafts', 'food', 'fun', 'festivities', 'favorite', 'Halloween', 'DVDs', 'are', 'quite', 'pleased', 'year', 'add', 'newest', 'Wiggles', 'DVD', 'Wiggly', 'Halloween', 'collection', 'must', 'watch', 'October', 'kids', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'Wiggle', 'fans', 'practically', 'birth', 'daughter', '5', '1/2', 'years', 'son', 'nearly', '3', 'were', 'pretty', 'excited', 'DVD', 'Wiggly', 'Halloween', 'DVD', 'are', 'twenty', 'Halloween', 'inspired', 'songs', 'kids', 'favorites', 'were', 'Skeleton', 'Scat', 'Three', 'Little', 'Pumpkins', 'Zombie', 'Feet', 'Trick', 'Treat', 'Most', 'songs', 'are', 'upbeat', 'catchy', 'lot', 'fun', 'appreciate', 'fun', 'approach', 'instead', 'spooky', 'scary', 'take', 'holiday', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'help', 'kids', 'transition', 'holiday', 'be', 'prepared', 'might', 'see', 'knowing', 'good', 'fun.I', 'will', 'have', 'say', 'disliked', 'Little', 'Vampire', 'Song', 'DVD', 'song', 'about', 'little', 'vampires', 'prefer', 'Cranberry', 'juice', 'blood', 'lyrics', 'want', 'suck', 'cranberry', 'juice', 'now', 'now', 'now', 'little', 'one', 'been', 'repeating', 'partial', 'lyrics', 'hearing', 'song', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'bad', 'way', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'song', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Cock', 'Robin', 'belonged', 'DVD', 'kids', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'confuse', 'kids', 'death', 'murder', 'just', 'odd', 'addition', 'collection', 'few', 'songs', 'seemed', 'just', 'place', 'overall', 'not', 'bad', 'addition', 'Wiggles', 'collection.Bonus', 'features', 'include', 'Ready', 'Steady', 'Wiggle', 'Tv', 'series', 'episode', 'Twinkle', 'Twinkle', 'photo', 'gallery', 'Wiggles', 'Characters', 'kids', 'liked', 'bonuses', 'was', 'fan', 'Jukebox', 'feature', 'where', 'could', 'go', 'pick', 'song', 'wanted', 'played', 'instead', 'needing', 'watch', 'DVD', 'way', 'especially', 'will', 'be', 'songs', ""'ll"", 'be', 'skipping']",The Wiggles: Wiggly Halloween
