However, the Commentaries (which I do listen to) give away some future plot points.  Very annoying to a new viewer.  Although you may need the Commentaries to find out who some of the main actors are,if you never watched it on TV, and if you intend to listen to the Commentaries, I would recommend watching the 13 episodes first and then going back and listen to the Commentaries. These Commentaries are pretty episode-specific for the most part, so it may be hard to remember exactly what happened in an episode that way, but it is better than having the future episodes spoiled to an extent before you get to them. Because there was so much going on in each episode, they were not completely ruined, but it would have been better if the future plots were kept under wraps as they said they were during the actual first season run, and talking only about that or previous episodes.

1117074,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B000YABIQ6,,"[0, 0]","I am late getting on the ""Mad Men"" bandwagon. After watching the entire first season (devouring it more is more like it) I can now see what all the fuss is about.""Mad Men"" is a period piece; the period portrayed being the advertising world of New York in the early 19060's. Like any good period piece, the costumes, sets, tone, etc. are all faithful to the time period which it is supposed to be set (as far as I can tell). However, also like any good period piece, the characters, fleshed out and fully human, show that no matter how much things change, the more they stay the same.The characters in ""Mad Men"" are all playing the hands they've been dealt. It's entertaining to watch the men of agency Sterling-Cooper enjoying the privileges of being white, male, and professional at the time: at the office they smoke like chimneys, drink like fish, and are free to sexually harass the hell out of every female in the vicinity. However, the series quickly goes beneath that surface to show the complexity behind that seemingly chauvinistic situation. Many of the men, despite all their bravado, are mostly frightened babies, often buckling under the pressures of professional and family life. And many of the women, although seemingly submissive, expertly manipulate their situations to their advantage. Nothing is ever quite as it seems.Even when it ventures into sensationalistic territory, ""Mad Men"" always maintains an air of dignity that keeps it from devolving into the sad state of many ""edgy"" cable shows, where the need to shock is constantly overpowering the need for believable character development. I'm hoping that the series continues to take the high road and continue to develop these fascinating characters for years to come.",4,Beneath the surface,1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,1743,"['am', 'late', 'getting', 'Mad', 'Men', 'bandwagon', 'watching', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'devouring', 'more', 'more', 'can', 'now', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'about', 'Mad', 'Men', 'period', 'piece', 'period', 'portrayed', 'being', 'advertising', 'world', 'New', 'York', 'early', '19060', 'good', 'period', 'piece', 'costumes', 'sets', 'tone', 'etc', 'are', 'faithful', 'time', 'period', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'However', 'also', 'good', 'period', 'piece', 'characters', 'fleshed', 'out', 'fully', 'human', 'show', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'things', 'change', 'more', 'stay', 'same.The', 'characters', 'Mad', 'Men', 'are', 'playing', 'hands', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dealt', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'men', 'agency', 'Sterling-Cooper', 'enjoying', 'privileges', 'being', 'white', 'male', 'professional', 'time', 'office', 'smoke', 'chimneys', 'drink', 'fish', 'are', 'free', 'sexually', 'harass', 'hell', 'female', 'vicinity', 'However', 'series', 'quickly', 'surface', 'show', 'complexity', 'seemingly', 'chauvinistic', 'situation', 'Many', 'men', 'bravado', 'are', 'mostly', 'frightened', 'babies', 'often', 'buckling', 'pressures', 'professional', 'family', 'life', 'many', 'women', 'seemingly', 'submissive', 'expertly', 'manipulate', 'situations', 'advantage', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'quite', 'when', 'ventures', 'sensationalistic', 'territory', 'Mad', 'Men', 'always', 'air', 'dignity', 'devolving', 'sad', 'state', 'many', 'edgy', 'cable', 'shows', 'where', 'need', 'shock', 'constantly', 'overpowering', 'need', 'believable', 'character', 'development', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'series', 'take', 'high', 'road', 'continue', 'develop', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'years', 'come']",Mad Men: Season 1

1117076,AN9J46667D80O,B000YABIQ6,,"[0, 0]","If there's one thing I've learned by watching ""Mad Men"", it's that apparently NO ONE was happy in 1960. The men weren't happy and didn't know how to express it because they had to Be Men, and the women weren't happy because they were expected to be little more than mindless serving women. No one could talk about what they felt or what they really wanted, morality was subjective, and freedom was something you had only if you were a WASP, and even then it was the freedom to ONLY be a WASP and nothing else.""Mad Men"", as you doubtless know, tells the story of a group of advertising executives at a New York ad firm in 1960. The men, and they're almost all men, are kings of their domain, but are starting to sense the early stirrings of a peasant uprising. It's this - the conflict around the upcoming rise in freedom and equality for gays, women and blacks - that forms the basis of a lot of the most interesting stories in this show.The acting, directing and cinematography are all suberb.

1117080,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B000YABIQ6,,"[0, 0]","I must admit that my first encunter with Mad Men was not a good one.  I missed the entire first season and decided to try picking up with the first episode of the second season when it originally aired.  Big mistake!  Not only is that one of the weaker episodes of the second season (in my opinion) but attempting to jump on board with this series without having viewed any of the first is nearly impossible.  The characters created by Matthew Weiner and his creative team are remarkably layered and difficult to read and it is essential to start at the beginning in order to be able to more fully understand who these people are and what makes them tick.  So I recently went back to the very beginning and I was pleasantly surprised at just how engrossing, intelligent and shockingly moving it all turned out to be.  But you have to be patient.  Mad Men peels away the layers of its characters slowly and with precision never forcing the action along or making the characters do anything that feels unbeievable or forced.  The result is an admittedly slow pace, but after time it becomes almost hypnotic and the payoffs are huge.On the surface, Mad Men appears to be a highly stylized re-creation of the early 60's advertising business right down to the tiniest details.  But in reality, the show is all about what lies beneath that sleek surface and in Mad Men's case, that's a lot.  While the employees of the Sterling Cooper ad agency go about their daily routines (which include driniking and smoking in the workplace, treating the women in the office like objects and casually engaging in extramarital affairs), the entire cultural/social/poltical landscape is rapidly shifting.  The men and women of Mad Men are still clinging to the values and social conventions that were in place before the 60's tore the nation apart and redefined the roles of women and minorities and laid the groundwork for an entirely new national psyche.But Mad Men is also about the emotions, desires, wounds and other messy issues that the characters fight so desperately to avoid.  I think it's fair to say that part of the shows glacier pacing is a direct result of the strain on nearly every character to avoid dealing with things.  So a lot of time is spent watching the Mad Men and their wives/mistresses focus entirely on their work and the day to day routines that barely hold back the flood of emotions threatening to break free. It's a very accurate depiction of how people live their lives even today.  In the end, that is why Mad Men feels thouroughly contemporary and resonant.",4,The Surface Isn't Everything....,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,2573,"['must', 'admit', 'first', 'encunter', 'Mad', 'Men', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'missed', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'decided', 'try', 'picking', 'up', 'first', 'episode', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'Big', 'mistake', 'Not', 'only', 'one', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'opinion', 'attempting', 'jump', 'board', 'series', 'having', 'viewed', 'first', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'characters', 'created', 'Matthew', 'Weiner', 'creative', 'team', 'are', 'remarkably', 'layered', 'difficult', 'read', 'essential', 'start', 'beginning', 'order', 'be', 'able', 'more', 'fully', 'understand', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'what', 'tick', 'recently', 'went', 'back', 'very', 'beginning', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'engrossing', 'intelligent', 'shockingly', 'moving', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'have', 'be', 'patient', 'Mad', 'Men', 'away', 'layers', 'characters', 'slowly', 'precision', 'never', 'forcing', 'action', 'making', 'characters', 'do', 'anything', 'unbeievable', 'forced', 'result', 'admittedly', 'slow', 'pace', 'time', 'almost', 'hypnotic', 'payoffs', 'are', 'surface', 'Mad', 'Men', 'be', 'highly', 'stylized', 're-creation', 'early', '60', 'advertising', 'business', 'right', 'down', 'tiniest', 'details', 'reality', 'show', 'what', 'beneath', 'sleek', 'surface', 'Mad', 'Men', 'case', 'lot', 'employees', 'Sterling', 'Cooper', 'ad', 'agency', 'go', 'daily', 'routines', 'include', 'driniking', 'smoking', 'workplace', 'treating', 'women', 'office', 'objects', 'casually', 'engaging', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'entire', 'cultural/social/poltical', 'landscape', 'rapidly', 'shifting', 'men', 'women', 'Mad', 'Men', 'are', 'still', 'clinging', 'values', 'social', 'conventions', 'were', 'place', '60', 'nation', 'apart', 'redefined', 'roles', 'women', 'minorities', 'laid', 'groundwork', 'entirely', 'new', 'national', 'psyche.But', 'Mad', 'Men', 'also', 'emotions', 'desires', 'wounds', 'other', 'messy', 'issues', 'characters', 'fight', 'so', 'desperately', 'avoid', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'part', 'shows', 'glacier', 'pacing', 'direct', 'result', 'strain', 'nearly', 'character', 'avoid', 'dealing', 'things', 'So', 'lot', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'Mad', 'Men', 'wives/mistresses', 'focus', 'entirely', 'work', 'day', 'day', 'routines', 'barely', 'hold', 'back', 'flood', 'emotions', 'threatening', 'break', 'free', 'very', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'how', 'people', 'live', 'lives', 'even', 'today', 'end', 'why', 'Mad', 'Men', 'thouroughly', 'contemporary', 'resonant']",Mad Men: Season 1

The trouble is, he has a past he is running away from, and as he states in an episode with someone from his past, ""There's only one direction my life is moving, and that's forward."" The show also reminds us of the introduction of popular ads we now view as commonplace. There's Lucky Strikes, coffee brands, women's clothing. They've obviously done their research because I feel renewed pride in my work from watching how this show reflects we all have an important role in what we do, only sometimes need to be reminded. This show not only entertains you, but for me has reminded me where I've been and where I am now, and what's more, I can be proud of who I am.

1117083,A255Z6DI9OLLAE,B000YABIQ6,,"[0, 0]","I sat down to watch ONE episode of this much discussed series. I ended up watching the whole first season (not recommended). It is relentlessly compelling, it is slavish as to period detail (and I would know, I was about 6 at the time that this series is set in), it is very well made, atmospheric in extreme and so attentively constructed that I should have loved every minute of it.For those who are familiar with the term ""film noir"" then this is TV noir, and noir it is. One can be pulled into the very complex lives of each character yet not care about them in the least, save perhaps the secretary Peggy and I guess Don Draper and his Grace-Kelly-lite wife. (Both are so well played that to call it acting is a disservice to their efforts, they ARE these people, it is quite astonishing).Much as Miami Vice was once a standout production (sound, costume, location, intriguing protagonists, some unexpected ones like Edward James Olmos, who MADE that whole show even have credibility) I suspect Mad Men is a similar quantity for today's overwhelmed viewer. I came from the advertising community, though not circa 1960!, and I can vouch for the attitudes and manner of Draper and coworkers, but it takes their careers and intermeshes into their personal character to such an extent as to be problematic. One of Draper's finest observations, and I won't give away any of the narrative plotlines, is when he muses how the younger generation has no one to look up to, just ""us"" meaning Draper and his incredibly flawed business partners, clients and neighbors.You want to care about them but it is darn near impossible. I did really take to the department store side line, Menckens, both father and daughter, but to say more is to give it away.Worth watching for the delightful care and nurturing of this project, the people behind the writing and production are superb!",4,slick and sad and happy those days are gone,1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,1871,"['sat', 'down', 'watch', 'ONE', 'episode', 'much', 'discussed', 'series', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'whole', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'recommended', 'relentlessly', 'compelling', 'slavish', 'period', 'detail', 'would', 'know', 'was', 'about', '6', 'time', 'series', 'set', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'atmospheric', 'extreme', 'so', 'attentively', 'constructed', 'should', 'have', 'loved', 'minute', 'it.For', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'term', 'film', 'noir', 'then', 'TV', 'noir', 'One', 'can', 'be', 'pulled', 'very', 'complex', 'lives', 'character', 'yet', 'not', 'care', 'least', 'save', 'perhaps', 'secretary', 'Peggy', 'guess', 'Don', 'Draper', 'Grace-Kelly-lite', 'wife', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'played', 'call', 'acting', 'disservice', 'efforts', 'ARE', 'people', 'quite', 'astonishing', '.Much', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'was', 'once', 'standout', 'production', 'sound', 'costume', 'location', 'intriguing', 'protagonists', 'unexpected', 'ones', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'who', 'MADE', 'whole', 'show', 'even', 'have', 'credibility', 'suspect', 'Mad', 'Men', 'similar', 'quantity', 'today', 'overwhelmed', 'viewer', 'came', 'advertising', 'community', 'not', 'circa', '1960', 'can', 'vouch', 'attitudes', 'manner', 'Draper', 'coworkers', 'careers', 'intermeshes', 'personal', 'character', 'extent', 'be', 'problematic', 'One', 'Draper', 'finest', 'observations', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'narrative', 'plotlines', 'when', 'how', 'younger', 'generation', 'one', 'look', 'up', 'just', 'meaning', 'Draper', 'incredibly', 'flawed', 'business', 'partners', 'clients', 'neighbors.You', 'want', 'care', 'darn', 'impossible', 'did', 'really', 'take', 'department', 'store', 'side', 'line', 'Menckens', 'father', 'daughter', 'say', 'more', 'give', 'away.Worth', 'watching', 'delightful', 'care', 'nurturing', 'project', 'people', 'writing', 'production', 'are', 'superb']",Mad Men: Season 1

Yet, I found myself so thoroughly enjoying this show that I couldn't resist adding my 2 cents.I had heard that the show took place in the 60's and was a fairly accurate account of life then--reflecting on business, the attitudes of men, the place of women, the homogenous business world.  None of which sounded like I would enjoy the show.  And yet, it came with such high praises that i was very compelled to  at least give it a try.And I am glad I did.  Yes, it was a bigoted time.  Men treated women in a way that i find less than desirable.  Some women behaved in a way that diminished themselves just as much as the men diminished them.  But I found it almost comical--making it so glaringly obvious that the attitudes and behaviors were not the highest of human potential.  It actually reminds me of the way I feel about All in the Family--all in the family was a bigoted show that I think was really making fun of bigotry rather than promoting it.The story also makes me reflect on my own life--how am i influenced by media?  how do i diminish myself?  But better than all of the reflection that I find myself doing--I enjoy the humor and great story line as well.And also to specifically speak of the product and not just the series--I love that this has an auto play feature on the disc.  I know it sounds like  a minor thing--but i like the ability to just press auto play and it plays all the episodes on the disc rather than you having to go back to the main menu after each show and selecting the next one. The extras found on the DVD include interviews and commentaries, photos, and other things.  I didn't purchase this for the extras.  If i had to pick an extra that i enjoyed was the music.

With the exception of Pam Am which only ran for 1 season (I can see why), the pickings are lean for this period. After all, much more was happening in the late 60s and 70s, so why take the risk? Well done, AMC!On the surface, it starts off captivating. The sets, costumes and misogynistic mindsets, are spot on. Sure there were a few bloopers : pantyhose was only launched in 1959 and I doubt that mousy Peggy Olsen would have been a trailblazer, in spite of showing backbone and ambition in subsequent series. There are more, if you are really looking.  Rather sit back and enjoy the series - there is so much accurate attention to detail that the odd blunder can be overlooked.On the surface, it appears to degenerate into just another soapie, but looking deeper, there is a subtlety of character development that is easily missed. The undercurrents in the dialog and lifestyle require your attention. I have often rewound a scene to ensure that I grasped the innuendo.Season 1's compulsion to have constant smoke filled sets coupled with unlimited drinking borders on subliminal propaganda. It is not realistic and I found it distracting to the point that the rest of what went on became secondary at times. Sure, people smoked and drank a lot in those days, but not everyone, all the time, otherwise they would be too plastered by lunch time time to get any work done. Fortunately this gets toned down in future seasons.I am currently on Season 3 and still enjoying it.

I unexpectedly learned the various ways that media and other various outlets can have subtle influence.  It was also important for me to watch the first season in order to help me further understand the other seasons of Mad Men that I intend to watch. The following are some of the various facets of the season 1 that piqued my interest and made the characters relatable and series worthwhile to watch:The characters of Don Draper, Betty Draper, and Rachel Menken have all experienced what it feels like to lose their mothers to physical death. Additionally, the character of Don Draper had to secretly carry the societal stigma of his late biological mother being a prostitute. I also liked how Betty Draper was portrayed as a dynamic woman who adores both her children and husband but yearns for a life of her own outside the home. I feel that this portrayal is realistic due to my own personal experiences of observing my late adoptive mother until I was 18 years old. She dearly loved my siblings and me as well as my adoptive father. However, I frequently noticed that her face lit up more during the time periods in her life when she had to get ready for work.Watching the characters of Joan Holloway giving career advice to Peggy Olson made gave the series a great touch because both women were carefully navigating their professional lives while dealing with workplace sexual harassment. The Progressive Car Insurance lady (Stephanie Courtney) and Darby Stanchfield (from the TV series Scandal) also make appearances during Mad Men season 1.The following pop culture references are among those mentioned in Mad Mean season 1: Lady Chatterley, Sara Lee cake, Atlas Shrugged, Mad magazine, Rosetta Stone, and Clearasil.Mad Men Season 1 is a fascinating series to watch for those who are either interested in American culture from the 1960's, enjoy watching drama series, and/or those curious about the world of advertising.",5,Ambitious Men,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,2143,"['Mad', 'Men', 'Season', '1', 'caught', 'attention', 'fascination', 'public', 'relations', 'world', 'story', 'being', 'based', 'career', 'symbolism', 'advertising', 'indirectly', 'related', 'public', 'relations', 'unexpectedly', 'learned', 'various', 'ways', 'media', 'other', 'various', 'outlets', 'can', 'have', 'subtle', 'influence', 'was', 'also', 'important', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'order', 'help', 'further', 'understand', 'other', 'seasons', 'Mad', 'Men', 'intend', 'watch', 'following', 'are', 'various', 'facets', 'season', '1', 'piqued', 'interest', 'made', 'characters', 'relatable', 'series', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'characters', 'Don', 'Draper', 'Betty', 'Draper', 'Rachel', 'Menken', 'have', 'experienced', 'what', 'lose', 'mothers', 'physical', 'death', 'Additionally', 'character', 'Don', 'Draper', 'had', 'secretly', 'carry', 'societal', 'stigma', 'late', 'biological', 'mother', 'being', 'prostitute', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'Betty', 'Draper', 'was', 'portrayed', 'dynamic', 'woman', 'who', 'children', 'husband', 'yearns', 'life', 'own', 'home', 'feel', 'portrayal', 'realistic', 'due', 'own', 'personal', 'experiences', 'observing', 'late', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'was', '18', 'years', 'old', 'dearly', 'loved', 'siblings', 'as', 'well', 'adoptive', 'father', 'However', 'frequently', 'noticed', 'face', 'lit', 'up', 'more', 'time', 'periods', 'life', 'when', 'had', 'get', 'ready', 'work.Watching', 'characters', 'Joan', 'Holloway', 'giving', 'career', 'advice', 'Peggy', 'Olson', 'made', 'gave', 'series', 'great', 'touch', 'women', 'were', 'carefully', 'navigating', 'professional', 'lives', 'dealing', 'workplace', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'Progressive', 'Car', 'Insurance', 'lady', 'Stephanie', 'Courtney', 'Darby', 'Stanchfield', 'TV', 'series', 'Scandal', 'also', 'make', 'appearances', 'Mad', 'Men', 'season', '1.The', 'following', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'are', 'mentioned', 'Mad', 'Mean', 'season', '1', 'Lady', 'Chatterley', 'Sara', 'Lee', 'cake', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'Mad', 'magazine', 'Rosetta', 'Stone', 'Clearasil.Mad', 'Men', 'Season', '1', 'fascinating', 'series', 'watch', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'American', 'culture', '1960', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'drama', 'series', 'and/or', 'curious', 'world', 'advertising']",Mad Men: Season 1

This is one of the best Dramas that I have seen in a VERY LONG TIME.This first season takes place in about 1960 where the best thing a woman could hope for was senior secretary in the career world of business.  It shows how the main characters, all of which are seriously in need of massive amounts of therapy, deal with their own problems.  Don Draper, the creative head of an advertising agency, is a cheating drunk who has a great amount of talent.  Joan, the senior secretary, is a classic gorgeous female whose biggest hope is land a rich husband, but doesn't realize that she secretly feels empty and desires more out of life.  Peggy Olsen starts out as Don's secretary, but because the office drunk, Freddy, gives credit where credit is due, gets a chance to become more than just a secretary.  Don takes Peggy under his wing because he sees a part of himself in Peggy, ambition and talent with the desire to go outside the traditional roles that society had set for women at that time.  Pete Campbell is the office jerk who has an on-again-off-again relationship with Peggy.  As for the rest of the characters, they are each either unless or screwed up or both as they can be and they try to deal with all of that while navigating the trials and tribulations of adulthood.  Some of things that happen to those characters are interesting, some are funny, and a few are just somewhat weird.I highly recommend this series to adults who love good dramas, but the underlying subject matter and a few of the basic themes are not suitable for children.",5,A Believable Great Drama,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,1707,"['Overall', 'great', 'series', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'amazing', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'allow', 'be', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'one', 'best', 'Dramas', 'have', 'seen', 'VERY', 'LONG', 'TIME.This', 'first', 'season', 'place', '1960', 'where', 'best', 'thing', 'woman', 'could', 'hope', 'was', 'senior', 'secretary', 'career', 'world', 'business', 'how', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'seriously', 'need', 'massive', 'amounts', 'therapy', 'deal', 'own', 'problems', 'Don', 'Draper', 'creative', 'head', 'advertising', 'agency', 'cheating', 'drunk', 'who', 'great', 'amount', 'talent', 'Joan', 'senior', 'secretary', 'classic', 'gorgeous', 'female', 'biggest', 'hope', 'land', 'rich', 'husband', ""n't"", 'realize', 'secretly', 'empty', 'more', 'life', 'Peggy', 'Olsen', 'out', 'Don', 'secretary', 'office', 'drunk', 'Freddy', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'chance', 'become', 'more', 'just', 'secretary', 'Don', 'Peggy', 'wing', 'part', 'Peggy', 'ambition', 'talent', 'desire', 'go', 'traditional', 'roles', 'society', 'had', 'set', 'women', 'time', 'Pete', 'Campbell', 'office', 'jerk', 'who', 'on-again-off-again', 'relationship', 'Peggy', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'screwed', 'up', 'can', 'be', 'try', 'deal', 'navigating', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'adulthood', 'things', 'happen', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'are', 'funny', 'few', 'are', 'just', 'somewhat', 'weird.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'adults', 'who', 'love', 'good', 'dramas', 'underlying', 'subject', 'matter', 'few', 'basic', 'themes', 'are', 'not', 'suitable', 'children']",Mad Men: Season 1

So you can't see the vibrant colors.Like what color ball gown so and so was wearing.It really bothers me some of the things people say to each other.Even though I know people talk like this, then and now.Like Roger telling a female friend who is his right arm that she is the finest piece of ass he's has ever had, or how one character tells peggy who is slightly chubby , and she should  enjoy the crude comments made by execs while they last, cuz she isn't much to look at.The only quibble I have is the dvd doesn't come with many perks.

1117119,A16GAIJJE39T1S,B000YABIQ6,,"[1, 1]","Although I did not grow up as the child of a Madison Avenue type, I recognize this as the world of my childhood.  I guess that I was about the age of Don's daughter Sally back then.  Mad Men certainly captures the ambiance of that highly sexualized and politically incorrect era.  I find Don and his pals both troubling and sympathetic.  The men are certainly passionate about their work, but their interactions with their wives and girlfriends seem almost completely phoned in.  When Don looses an client--he is shattered--but loosing a girlfriend (or a terrible fight with his wife) hardly makes him blink.  Really, the only relationship between a man and a woman that seems significant to me is that between Pete Campbell and his  wife Trudy--even though he is fooling around with Peggy on the side.I also find Don interesting as a sort of interface between the 60's Urban metropolis of his work world and his depression era rural roots.  One of my parents came from a rural community and home lit by only kerosine lanterns and devoid of indoor plumbing.  Much of my young life was spent trying to come to terms with the modern world as seen through the prism of my parents' rural and small town perspective.

1117120,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000YABIQ6,,"[1, 1]","AMC's much-acclaimed Mad Men is a sterling example of how primetime television has evolved recently. While past television shows were dull visually and inert dramatically, particularly when compared to film, top-tier shows now display a sophistication that I would've thought impossible a decade back. While much has been made of the detail and authenticity (or lack thereof) of the early 60s setting, the specific locale (an Advertising Agency, Sterling Cooper, on Madison avenue) is equally intriguing. Though dramatic shows generally demand exciting professions (police, law or medical), the seemingly dull field of advertising is a brilliantly appropriate backdrop for an examination of the intricacies and drama of day to day life. As Mad Men repeatedly demonstrates, advertising is not about what is on the surface, but instead draws out that which was once inside, revealing that which no one, perhaps even the individual who is being exposed, was aware of.Though Mad Men boasts an impressively large ensemble cast, the first season focuses primarily on a few central figures. At the heart of the show is creative department head Don Draper (Jon Hamm), the contradictory protagonist and already one of the most compelling characters on television. Though often amoral, Draper still embodies a masculine ideal: he is smart, cynical, ultra-competent and largely indifferent to social expectations. (Not to mention improbably handsome, but in a masculine, un-feminized way.) Draper is not without a core of vulnerability, but this only serves to give his strengths more weight. We also follow Draper's homelife, including his neurotic, vaguely unsatisfied wife Betty (January Jones) and their two young children. (Whom Don obviously loves, making his frequent neglect and betrayal all the more puzzling.) As a foil to Draper we have Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), a well-born and entitled junior executive who imagines himself heir to Draper's throne. Finally we have Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss), a new secretary and eventual copy writer who is largely (though not entirely) separate from the cutthroat ethos of the office, and who often serves as an audience stand in. The cast of secondary characters (not that I've even covered all the major ones) is too large to really consider here, though the ensemble portrays them all with skill. The sheer size is perhaps a minor weakness initially, as it takes a long time for the average viewer to even remember who is who, and even longer for the characters to be developed. Nevertheless, it is worth the wait and effort.The story is equally difficult to define, with the show taking an organic approach, juggling numerous different subplots without necessarily resolving them fully. The overarching threads could loosely be defined as the fate of Sterling Cooper generally (they're a small agency with, shall we say, erratic and unreliable leadership) and the uncovering of Don Draper's history. (He rarely talks about it, and with good reason . . .)  While the hedonistic lifestyle at the office is always substantial, I find the business angle particularly intriguing, with the show examining the underlying logic behind many real world ad campaigns. (These elements also give Draper a chance to cynically philosophize, which is always a treat.)Though the intriguing storytelling soon takes hold, the new viewer will must likely first note the shows extraordinary visuals. While we don't typically think of eras that still hang on common memory as being fodder for period-piece detail, Mad Men recreates the dawn of the 60s with all the care that a high budget film would give to any pre-modern era. (Truthfully, I couldn't say if the visualization is utterly accurate, but the totality of the vision is certain.) Relatedly, Mad Men's depiction of older social mores has been the major source of both praise and controversy. Though a fairly socially conservative individual myself (outlandish tastes notwithstanding), I can't help but feel the more old-fashioned critics are missing something. Intentionally or not, Mad Men works as an antidote to the laughably superficial views of the era promoted by tedious productions like Sam Mendes' adaptation of ""Revolutionary Road."" Modern liberals like to pretend that social conservatism and conformity were the cause of all middle class misery prior to the 60s, but is anyone foolish enough to believe that Don or Pete or Betty would be totally content if they'd been after the blessed 60s? Though there are plenty of ""oh my god look at how terrible people were in 1960"" moments, Mad Men is ultimately just cynical, certain that there is only so much we can do to rein in human weakness. (Note how the beats and self righteous proto-hippies are portrayed in a less than glowing light, and are verbally eviscerated by Draper.) The validity of this perspective can be debated, but it's not quite the same as simple permissiveness. (I'd also say that the show's values are fundamentally bourgeois, though that's a debate too tiresome and lengthy to consider here.)In the end, most great art or entertainment is defined by the nebulous core of humanity that is absent from mediocre works. Even though the characters often behave reprehensibly, an attachment gradually develops. This culminates in sorrowful season finale, where we see the initially overly vain and unsympathetic Betty breakdown in front of the weird neighbor child over the state of her marriage and life, desperately asking for this prepubescent boy to tell her everything will be okay. Even better is Don's nostalgia pitch for the carousel slide projector, where he illustrates the notion with a brief speech given over a series of photos from the happier times of his family's checkered past, and his always impassive face blanches and glazes over just so slightly with restrained emotion. Rationally, neither Don nor Betty is worthy of all that much sympathy, but here reason no longer applies. By the end of the first season, Mad Men has reached that magical point where the fictional figures mean more to the viewer than such non-existent figures have any right to. This is another rarity on TV, and an accomplishment that more than offsets whatever minor flaws the show may have.",5,Another landmark in the evolution of TV drama,1250380800,"08 16,

But I am also sure Peter and Peggy will linger in your thoughts.This is such intelligent television.  It is of the caliber you would expect from HBO or Showtime.  The historical facts are very interesting to me.  They show the whole campaign and election between Kennedy and Nixon.  I am 47 now so was not around for that.  It is so interesting to see that Kennedy was not so overly popular when running and it shocked many when he won.  The first Catholic president.  My, my.  I find that very timely with the election we are facing.Nothing was spared to make this show the highest quality and the most accurate.

1117127,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000YABIQ6,,"[1, 1]","Mad Men - Season Onehas completely changed the way I view TV.  I generally watch things at random and don't watch a lot of shows consistently.  This is a show worth changing that for.  It's hard to describe what makes this show such a rare event in TV.  Somebody had the vision to put a show on TV that has something to say and is as raw, honest and true to the period it is based on.  I, for one, am grateful for that.The show centers on the NY advertising world of the 1960s. Why ""Mad Men?""  The old row of famous agencies on Madison Avenue, of course.  The men are sexist, rude, slicked up, and well dressed. The women are submissive yet cunning, half accepting sexism and half ignoring it.There's not a lot of political correctness here.  That is bound to offend some.  While my first reaction was to wonder as to the motives behind that, the truth is that after watching the show for a few episodes it becomes clear that the bigotry of the period is key to understanding the characters.  Plenty that the characters say would get them fired today. For their era, sexist banter in the office was considered par for the course.There's also plenty of smoking, drinking and sexual situations.  If you are very conservative this might not be for you.  Yet even conservative people would have to warm up somewhat to the effectiveness of the portrayal. This show makes you believe you are witnessing things as they were. Not having been there, we can't know for sure.  Regardless, this sure is convincing.There are some nice special features and extras sprinkled sparingly throughout the disks.  Of course you have your usual commentary tracks on the episodes, which are actually worth listing to in my opinion.  Not every show can say that.The behind-the-scenes documentary section is also standard fare, but well done. It covers the basic elements of how the show is put together, from characters, sets, makeup, wardrobes, and art design. You also get some small extras that are nice like a segment on scoring the music for the show, which is great, and audio clips of some of the period songs that are used.Because of the way the disks are set up, many of these specific extras are on the individual disks.  So you have to search for them. Also, there are only a few episodes per disk (about 3).  I guess those extras and commentary tracks took up a lot of disk space.  Still, these are minor details.ConclusionThis is a great show and well worth watching again and again.  I hope you will check this out if you haven't already.Enjoy!",5,"Mad Men Season One - Raw, Offensive, Powerful and Highly Addicting!!!",1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,2534,"['Mad', 'Men', 'Season', 'Onehas', 'completely', 'changed', 'way', 'view', 'TV', 'generally', 'watch', 'things', 'random', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lot', 'shows', 'consistently', 'show', 'worth', 'changing', 'hard', 'describe', 'what', 'show', 'such', 'rare', 'event', 'TV', 'Somebody', 'had', 'vision', 'put', 'show', 'TV', 'something', 'say', 'raw', 'honest', 'true', 'period', 'based', 'one', 'am', 'grateful', 'that.The', 'show', 'centers', 'NY', 'advertising', 'world', '1960s', 'Why', 'Mad', 'Men', 'old', 'row', 'famous', 'agencies', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'course', 'men', 'are', 'sexist', 'rude', 'slicked', 'up', 'well', 'dressed', 'women', 'are', 'submissive', 'yet', 'cunning', 'half', 'accepting', 'sexism', 'half', 'ignoring', 'not', 'lot', 'political', 'correctness', 'here', 'bound', 'offend', 'first', 'reaction', 'was', 'wonder', 'motives', 'truth', 'watching', 'show', 'few', 'episodes', 'clear', 'bigotry', 'period', 'key', 'understanding', 'characters', 'Plenty', 'characters', 'say', 'would', 'get', 'fired', 'today', 'era', 'sexist', 'banter', 'office', 'was', 'considered', 'par', 'course.There', 'also', 'plenty', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'sexual', 'situations', 'are', 'very', 'conservative', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'even', 'conservative', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'warm', 'up', 'somewhat', 'effectiveness', 'portrayal', 'show', 'believe', 'are', 'witnessing', 'things', 'were', 'Not', 'having', 'been', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'Regardless', 'sure', 'are', 'nice', 'special', 'features', 'extras', 'sprinkled', 'sparingly', 'disks', 'course', 'have', 'usual', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'episodes', 'are', 'actually', 'worth', 'listing', 'opinion', 'Not', 'show', 'can', 'say', 'that.The', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'section', 'also', 'standard', 'fare', 'well', 'done', 'basic', 'elements', 'how', 'show', 'put', 'together', 'characters', 'sets', 'makeup', 'wardrobes', 'art', 'design', 'also', 'get', 'small', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'segment', 'scoring', 'music', 'show', 'great', 'audio', 'clips', 'period', 'songs', 'are', 'way', 'disks', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'many', 'specific', 'extras', 'are', 'individual', 'disks', 'So', 'have', 'search', 'Also', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'disk', '3', 'guess', 'extras', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'took', 'up', 'lot', 'disk', 'space', 'Still', 'are', 'minor', 'details.ConclusionThis', 'great', 'show', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'hope', 'will', 'check', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'already.Enjoy']",Mad Men: Season 1

I'm a bit young to remember the time period of Mad Men's first season (1960), but the tone of the times feels right.Casting is wonderful.  Jon Hamm as Don Draper is a real find.  This guy is perfect in the role, Brylcreem and all.  He is a ad genius, a madly successful ad man who thinks on his feet, has brilliant insights, a beautiful loving wife (the unbelievably attractive January Jones), and two smart kids.  He has it all, but wants more.  He beds a series of women, because he likes them and likes the sex.  He just assumes his wife will be oblivious to that; and in those times maybe that happened more often than not.There are films or series that are mainly set in the workplace, but most don't focus on the day-to-day interactions, at that workplace.  We don't learn how to behave or interact in those series.  Obviously, there are some notable ones, but most of even those (The Office, NYPD Blue, House, The Wire) feature people we just don't know that well (cops, doctors, comedy writers, (and in the case of the Office, complete goofs)).  Mad Men, we can identify with, because we all consider ourselves somewhat of experts on advertising, since we see lots and lots of it, every day.Very Highly Recommended. An excellent show in all regards.  Five plus stars for Mad Men.  They have a winner here.  Can you believe that HBO passed on this one?Let me add a bit on the DVD extras.  There are a lot of them, and insightful.  We learn, for example, that the first show (the pilot) was filmed in New York before moving to LA.  The sets feature ceilings, because the director wanted to show the period suspended ceilings (most productions have no ceilings because that's where the lights and other equipment hang).",5,Superb,1277510400,"06 26, 2010",2010,1828,"['Sometimes', 'TV', 'series', 'movie', 'along', 'eight', 'cylinders', 'Mad', 'Men', 'one', ""'m"", 'bit', 'young', 'remember', 'time', 'period', 'Mad', 'Men', 'first', 'season', '1960', 'tone', 'times', 'feels', 'right.Casting', 'wonderful', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'Don', 'Draper', 'real', 'find', 'guy', 'perfect', 'role', 'Brylcreem', 'ad', 'genius', 'madly', 'successful', 'ad', 'man', 'who', 'feet', 'brilliant', 'insights', 'beautiful', 'loving', 'wife', 'unbelievably', 'attractive', 'January', 'Jones', 'two', 'smart', 'kids', 'more', 'series', 'women', 'sex', 'just', 'wife', 'will', 'be', 'oblivious', 'times', 'maybe', 'happened', 'more', 'often', 'not.There', 'are', 'films', 'series', 'are', 'mainly', 'set', 'workplace', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'focus', 'day-to-day', 'interactions', 'workplace', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'how', 'behave', 'interact', 'series', 'Obviously', 'are', 'notable', 'ones', 'most', 'even', 'Office', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'House', 'Wire', 'feature', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'well', 'cops', 'doctors', 'comedy', 'writers', 'case', 'Office', 'complete', 'goofs', 'Mad', 'Men', 'can', 'identify', 'consider', 'ourselves', 'somewhat', 'experts', 'advertising', 'see', 'lots', 'lots', 'day.Very', 'Highly', 'Recommended', 'excellent', 'show', 'regards', 'Five', 'stars', 'Mad', 'Men', 'have', 'winner', 'here', 'Can', 'believe', 'HBO', 'passed', 'one', 'Let', 'add', 'bit', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'lot', 'insightful', 'learn', 'example', 'first', 'show', 'pilot', 'was', 'filmed', 'New', 'York', 'moving', 'LA', 'sets', 'feature', 'ceilings', 'director', 'wanted', 'show', 'period', 'suspended', 'ceilings', 'most', 'productions', 'have', 'ceilings', 'where', 'lights', 'other', 'equipment', 'hang']",Mad Men: Season 1

I'm certainly not such a person, so upon hearing the idea of a cable series set on the Madison Avenue advertising scene as the nation stood on the cusp of the 1960s had enormous appeal.  Especially interesting is the HBO-style (indeed, this was originally pitched as an HBO series, and shot down; I'm grateful, if only because the DVD prices would be that much more severe) unvarnished presentation of the era.  Moralists who romanticize this period as a haven of old-fashioned morality will be disappointed when confronted by the truth (or something like it) about contemporary attitudes.Our main character is Don Draper (Jon Hamm, in a marvelous performance; it is surprising that he doesn't do more period work, because he's absolutely perfect for the look of the 1950s), the creative director at Sterling Cooper, a moderate-sized ad agency run by Roger Sterling (John Slattery, best known to me from ""Jack & Bobby"") and Bertram Cooper (Robert Morse).  He and his team, most notably newcoming Peter Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser, Angel's son Connor on ""Angel""), are charged with marketing such illustrious products as cigarettes (and helping the company duck restrictions imposed by federal health agencies).  Don is something of a mystery both at work and at home, where his wife Betty (January Jones, in a revelatory performance; I'd previously never thought of her as anything other than a pretty face) is living a life of quiet desperation.  Through Don we see the life of a successful male executive; he's got a beautiful wife, more than one mistress on the side (proto-hippy Midge, then department store executive Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff), the only woman in the show not occupying a menial position, and she owes that to her father), and is friends with his boss Roger.  Below him, Campbell and his cohorts battle for favour and advancement.Standout performances come from Hamm in the title role, Christina Hendricks as Joan, a secretary well-versed in using her sexuality to get what she wants (she'd be running the place if she lived 40 years later), and Elisabeth Moss as Peggy, a newby secretary with professional ambitions that are well beyond what is expected of women in that era, althoug timid Peggy doesn't seem the type to overtly identify with the feminist movement.The DVD packaging has been a point of some contention here (see many of the 1-star reviews).  The original lighter-shaped box is a nifty design, though you do indeed have to watch while you close it (although the explanatory booklet in the back seems an effective shield on my set).",5,"The revolutionary decade, from the viewpoint of the establishment.",1219708800,"08 26, 2008",2008,2609,"['Who', ""n't"", 'love', 'good', 'period', 'drama', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'person', 'hearing', 'idea', 'cable', 'series', 'set', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'advertising', 'scene', 'nation', 'stood', 'cusp', '1960s', 'had', 'enormous', 'appeal', 'Especially', 'interesting', 'HBO-style', 'indeed', 'was', 'originally', 'pitched', 'HBO', 'series', 'shot', 'down', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'only', 'DVD', 'prices', 'would', 'be', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'severe', 'unvarnished', 'presentation', 'era', 'Moralists', 'who', 'romanticize', 'period', 'haven', 'old-fashioned', 'morality', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'when', 'confronted', 'truth', 'something', 'contemporary', 'attitudes.Our', 'main', 'character', 'Don', 'Draper', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'surprising', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'period', 'work', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'look', '1950s', 'creative', 'director', 'Sterling', 'Cooper', 'moderate-sized', 'ad', 'agency', 'run', 'Roger', 'Sterling', 'John', 'Slattery', 'best', 'known', 'Jack', 'Bobby', 'Bertram', 'Cooper', 'Robert', 'Morse', 'team', 'most', 'notably', 'newcoming', 'Peter', 'Campbell', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'Angel', 'son', 'Connor', 'Angel', 'are', 'charged', 'marketing', 'such', 'illustrious', 'products', 'cigarettes', 'helping', 'company', 'duck', 'restrictions', 'imposed', 'federal', 'health', 'agencies', 'Don', 'something', 'mystery', 'work', 'home', 'where', 'wife', 'Betty', 'January', 'Jones', 'revelatory', 'performance', ""'d"", 'previously', 'never', 'thought', 'anything', 'other', 'pretty', 'face', 'living', 'life', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'Don', 'see', 'life', 'successful', 'male', 'executive', 'got', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'more', 'one', 'mistress', 'side', 'proto-hippy', 'Midge', 'then', 'department', 'store', 'executive', 'Rachel', 'Menken', 'Maggie', 'Siff', 'only', 'woman', 'show', 'not', 'occupying', 'menial', 'position', 'father', 'friends', 'boss', 'Roger', 'Campbell', 'cohorts', 'battle', 'favour', 'advancement.Standout', 'performances', 'come', 'Hamm', 'title', 'role', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'Joan', 'secretary', 'well-versed', 'using', 'sexuality', 'get', 'what', ""'d"", 'be', 'running', 'place', 'lived', '40', 'years', 'later', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'Peggy', 'newby', 'secretary', 'professional', 'ambitions', 'are', 'well', 'what', 'expected', 'women', 'era', 'althoug', 'timid', 'Peggy', ""n't"", 'seem', 'type', 'overtly', 'identify', 'feminist', 'movement.The', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'been', 'point', 'contention', 'here', 'see', 'many', '1-star', 'reviews', 'original', 'lighter-shaped', 'box', 'nifty', 'design', 'do', 'indeed', 'have', 'watch', 'close', 'explanatory', 'booklet', 'back', 'effective', 'shield', 'set']",Mad Men: Season 1

1117135,A6FIAB28IS79,B000YABIQ6,,"[1, 2]","This is the first television series I've seen that feels like a theatrical movie rather than another jittery, overly busy, manipulative made-for-TV video series, with frequently good acting wasted on formulaic, or non-existent, plots (the ""criminal minds"" of the series by that title are the writers) relying upon sensation, violence, and cheap digital effects to hook and maintain the viewer's interest. Moreover, the characters in ""Mad Men"" are not cardboard stereotypes but multidimensional and complex.  But perhaps not as much as they would like to think.  Women viewers need not feel guilty about watching ""Mad Men"" on the basis of the following features designed to attract a large female audience: the compelling if not magnetic quality of the flawed but strong and reassuringly handsome lead, John Hamm, who plays ultra-cool ad man Don Draper (he's got the right charisma to anchor an entire James Bond movie series); the representation of women in the 1960's, a period that requires a woman to be at once a ""toy doll,"" a ""perfect housewife,"" and of course, an unquestionably competent secretary, who has nothing but time on her hands to perform her duties with unfailing mechanical precision, always ready with the proper smile or facial expression at the proper time (or risk being fired, and without the ceremony offered incompetent male employees).Needless to say, the women who ""succeed"" are those who are, by the unspoken requirements of their subordinate position, academy-award winning actresses, capable of either a. landing a man who is a paid ticket to a suburban castle with charming children (and servants to smooth out life's ruffles) or b. miraculously carving out a place where they are recognized for their actual abilities, talents and individual potential.  The slights inflicted upon women on a continual basis are subtle and cumulative.  Like the series itself, the duplicity required of women to succeed, or simply to survive, in the work place becomes manifest gradually, requiring the viewer to pay close attention to the smallest details of dialogue and ""mis en scene"" (by contrast, most television series make NO demands of their viewers because there's ""nothing to look at"": in the overwhelming majority of television dramas the moving camera and shock editing is relentless, continually loud and intrusive of the home spectator's viewing space: in television, it seems, ""overstatement"" rules, giving the viewer no room for choice let alone interpretation. The medium behaves as though its only mission is, as quickly and as surely as possible, to ""captivate"" a witless audience that will think and feel as the camera and sound-track dictate.  ""Mad Man"" is, by contrast, an imitation of a far more recognizable life, one offering inscrutable, even dangerous ""games"" to every individual who's in the job market, desperate for a good job with benefits and opportunities for advancement but damned if he allows the urgency to show.  Moreover, the series is undeniably, from its first smoke-filled shots, a ""period piece"" that represents the '60s as some of us will certainly (if reluctantly) remember those years.  But it's more than a disturbing view of the past: it's a critique of the unexamined life and, necessarily, of the life of commercial television in the present age of ""late""-capitalism, when even the most under-educated viewers are becoming increasingly aware of the unbreachable divide between the haves and the have-nots, between those who exploit and profit from the desires of the American consumer and those suddenly made aware of the high cost of the American Dream and its increasing distance from the vast majority.You may need to pick up the series for rescreening if, to select a chapter at random, you missed the following in Episode 7, ""Red in the Face"":  The subtle collusion between Don and the elevator operator to assure the unforgettable climax of Roger's humiliation.  Notice Don's brief business with him both before and after the oysterfest, and notice the expressions on Roger's and Don's faces at the end of the episode.  Besides such details, consider the overaching design of the episode.  The theme is male predators, survival of the fittest, and misplaced hubris.  Roger will hit on Betty Draper, and the pathetic Pete will do the same with the store clerk who refuses to refund in cash his returned chip and dip.  Both come up empty-handed, though both try to sustain their moment of heroism.  Pete's sitting Peggy down on a couch to hear his story of gutting a rabbit and eating it in view of the fair damsel is parallell with Roger's stories to the overly appreciative (in Don's double-standard view)  Betty.  Then we have the chivalric subtheme of Betsy playing the fair princess to the unlikely 8-year-old knight whose mother's negligence leads to his coveting a lock of Betty's golden hair.  It's a rare moment when Betty is both the object of adoration and an empathetic mother who reaches out (which she can't do with her own family).  But just as Don blames her for Roger's bad behavior, the suddenly possessive mother of the wandering knight takes offense at Betty's gift.  As usual, she's sent back to the psychiatrist, though the planting of the rifle as Pete's new toy will take its rightful place in the story when Betsy takes a gun to the neighbor's pidgeons.  It's a moment of rage that is long overdue.Along with the examination of the pressure-cooker capitalism, the series is especially concerned with the roles demanded of (and therefore ""played by"") women.  The seeds are being planted throughout the entire first season, but the fully realized force of the objectification and belittlement of women (nothing so obvious as ""harassment"") will culminate in a chilling, unforgettable and appropriately titled episode, ""A Night to Remember,"" in the 2nd season (episode 8 from the 2008 season). The episode is a cinematic tour deforce, thus far the most ambitious chapter in a series that seems to be reinventing itself as it goes along, always improving. This particular segment is like vintage Robert Altman in its cross-cutting among the three women who have received the most attention. The time, historically, is the days immediately following news of Marilyn Monroe's suicide, and each of the three women--Joan, the queen-secretary who is herself a combination of keen intelligence in an hour-glass figure; Betty, the manipulated, blonde showgirl/perfect housewife/showcase trophy of Don Draper; Peggy, the innocent ""country girl"" who has wised-up sufficiently to the ways of men to play their game, attaining power to make decisions that will influence consumers throughout the nation--each of the three will receive potentially shattering epiphanies, showing them the emptiness of their programmed existences in a male-run world that expects of them only compliance along with adoration beyond any they themselves might receive for their physical attributes.  The realizations of all three occur in a breath-taking ""tour de force"" of characterization. The potent mix of minimalist but thoughtful script-writing, artful directing, and ""parallel"" editing allows the viewer to receive the full force of three separate ""actions"" (actually, internal ""epiphanies"") occurring simultaneously.The series is uncomfortably faithful to the period, not only in its portrayal of male-female relationships in and outside the workplace but in the continuous gauzy veil of smoke thrown off by chain-smoking characters along with the ubiquitous portable bars in the offices of hard-drinking executives (just a few examples of the irony of the ad squad coming under the influence of its own subliminal messages).  Most of the action is internal yet highly appealing to the eye, taking place in an office space that seems both capacious and capable of showing the viewer surprises and new discoveries with each episode. The colors are richly saturated--crisp and vibrant technicolor (not the faded, irridescent reds, blues, and greens that would replace them beginning in the late '60s and continuing throughout the 1970s), with a brightly lit, crystal clear, sharp resolution and a camera lens with revealing ""depth of field"" that takes full advantage of the big flat, high definition screens that have begun to dominate domestic space in just the past 5-6 years of the new millennium; the camera work--with striking angles but steady shots of sufficient duration to allow the spectator to see each crucial detail--has the professional sheen of a bonafide ""auteur"" such as the admired 1950s ""Hollywood"" director, Douglas Sirk.Frankly, I had all but ""given up"" on television--except for the talking heads on MSNBC and the mindless reality shows like ""Pawn Stars"" and ""American Pickers.""  Most of what passes for television drama is manipulative and ""busy"" to a degree that the viewer is placed in the paradoxical position of having nothing to look at.  Viewers are denied the ""freedom to see"" on their ever larger, higher definition screens.  Everything of importance to the sponsors and filmmakers is magnified or grossly overstated, then thrown in the spectator's face by the hyperactive videocam and ""shock"" editing. But this series, sponsored appropriately enough by American Movie Classics, is the most refreshing, ground-breaking television drama since ""All in the Family."" We should all hope that it represents a new beginning rather than an anomaly, unique and distinguished as it is.",5,Television worthy of the big screen: obsessive ad men and their (justifably) mad

Just a feeling of supreme ambivalence, and a healthy dose of disappointment. What can I say? The acting is solid, the wardrobes are gorgeous and so are the elaborate sets. Mad Men exudes an aura of the sixties, completely with music and the omnipresent haze of cigarette smoke.Unfortunately, once you get beyond the pretty packaging, there's not much there. The characters seem to be vying with each other for how unsympathetic they can become, and many of the plot lines(particularly those involving the main character, Don Draper) just don't hold together. I had expected the advertising world to provide much of the drama, but the show hops and skips from one client to the next, often with no resolution.Another issue is timeline--there is no coherent sense of time or exactly what's going on. Sometimes an episode covers a single day. . .and then the next episode picks up six months later, and you learn that the affair which was ""never going to happen"" in that episode, has been going on for the entire six months. It's very jarring.I might give the show one more try with Season 2, but not for a while.

The series certainly scores high style marks but substance is woefully lacking in this rather narcissistic view of 1960 Madison Avenue.  Once past the good looks, crisp lines and jaunty banter, I found myself wondering ""where's the beef?""  The directors seem to revel in this decidedly man's world where women seem little more than muses, except for Peggy Olsen who finds herself quickly rising up the ladder with her honest view of products.The firm of Sterling & Cooper comes across as a sexist bastion during a time when many women were breaking through such barriers.  You get the sense that Peggy is a younger version of Helen Gurley Brown who had worked herself up from the mailroom of the William Morris Agency to become one of the highest paid ad copywriters of the early 60s, eventually taking over Cosmopolitan and turning it into the magazine we know today.  Sexism was pervasive at the time, but this show seems to revel in it, with little sense of irony.The episodes are painfully slow and Don Draper is painfully boring.  It takes 12 excrutiating episodes to find out about his hidden past, which in the end doesn't appear to make the slightest impact on the story as Cooper dismisses Peter Campbell's revelatory scene out of hand.  Seems Don Draper can do no wrong, although he appears to have an increasingly hard time at home as his lovely wife Betty comes apart at the seams like Sylvia Plath in the Bell Jar.After 12 episodes, I feel like I've had enough, although fans of this series keep telling me how things pick up in season two.

It's filmed with cinematic sensibilities (the opening sequence borrows from Hitchcock's ""Vertigo""). The actors are fascinating to look at: they seem to have been chosen based on what was considered movie style beauty fifty years ago. There is enough attention to detail to make merely WATCHING the background sets interesting (I found myself pausing at several points to appreciate the rooms, furniture, wall hangings, and prehistoric office equipment (watching this show is a good way to discover atomic age style and design). All this is interesting--to a point. But the scripts are nothing more than adult soap operas. Unhappy housewives, cheating husbands, men with dark pasts. None of this adds up to much more than what you can get from a daytime soap opera. The fact that more money (a lot more money) and research went into this doesn't redeem it from what it really and truly is: a soap opera. None of the character's tribulations add up to much in the end. And the writers wasted a golden opportunity to say something significant about the time period. Rather than exploit that, they simply threw the same trash into a different era.

1117140,A1N37L78ZREG8Y,B000YABIQ6,,"[1, 5]","The debut season of this series is, plot-wise, certainly good enough to keep viewers wanting more.  And the actors are competent, though too often they are victims of an overwrought, parody-prone direction that skews the stolidness of their performanances.  For, truly, this cinematic offering is farcical and was meant to be.The premiere episodes of Mad Men deal with the legacy of the Fifties, and the show's creators have pulled out all the stops in mocking and denigrating the decade.  That alone will make for low satire, but the entire effort is enervated by an obvious lack of knowledge and understanding of the era.  Even in the basest forms of farce, the achievement of the sardonic depends on reality as its foundation, and the failure to employ subtlety in the treatment can doom its effectiveness.  For instance, this series presents smoking as ubiquitous and feverish in a manner that it never was.  At a time in which the activity was accepted almost everywhere, people did it leisurely.  There was no need to puff like a freight train for a nicotine high in a non-forbidden zone.  Many people used matches instead of lighters, and they didn't light up indoors with one hand shielding against a non-existent wind.  This kind of exaggeration results not in satire, but in burlesque.As for pacing, the first couple of episodes are hobbled by a seemingly desperate impulse to inject as much anti-Fifties propaganda as an audience could be expected to stomach.  White males are overtly chauvinistic, white females overtly compliant, and blacks of both sexes menial-working, overtly servile, covertly surly, resentful, unhappy people.  After these wearisome premises have been well, well established, then the series gets more deeply into plotting.The show's lead, Dan Draper, is not the manipulative, mercenary, unscrupulous, cut-throat character one might expect from the title.  Despite a sexist viewpoint, he treats women well.  He doesn't demean or prey on co-workers, and his on-the-side sex is with self-competent women.  He is affectionate and passionate with his wife.Yet the creators' compulsion to spoof the Fifties/Sixties demands that they present Mrs. Draper as a neurotic, self-centered suburban housewife who worries about pretty divorcees and would rather see her daughter dead that facially scarred.  She lets her children put plastic dry-cleaning covers over their heads and romp unbelted in her vehicle.  As she putters about in her pumps and crinolined dresses, she presents an over-the-top image of a demented Fifties homemaker who, she earnestly tells Draper, thinks of nothing else but having sex with him.  Indeed, she does have a handsome, attentive, hardworking husband who many women would covet, yet she fantacizes about coupling with a milktoasty salesman/stranger and--somehow--orgasms against a running washing machine.  But, then again, the series' only all-together women are promiscuous.  Even single career women with one lover are portrayed as naive, frustrated, or unhealthily guilt-ridden.  Pre-sexual-revolution females, the series all but shouts, were mostly miserable creatures who often died in childbirth or succumbed young to dreadful diseases.  Christianity crippled them emotionally and intellectually and, in at least one case, created a wicked stepmother.  By the time 1960 rolled around, they were dizzily wearing mismatched clothing, draping living room furniture, and voting for Richard Nixon.The problem with the program as lampoon is that it also strives to be a serious, ongoing serial that maintains interest and sympathy in Dan Draper.  It doesn't aid the drama to stick him in the same style of Production-Code pajamas that are also donned by his squirrely co-worker/rival or to subject the character and audience alike to  boring, protracted scenes like a beatnik debauch wherein everyone simply gets stoned.The best aspect of the series is the business intrigue that has little or nothing to do with the show's sex, which is often as hurried and unpassionate as a toilet-stall encounter between strangers.  Scenes that do denote true affection are, of course, subject to the usual modern-day dread of deep kissing between actors and thus come off as chaste and staid.The cause of the latter matter is something that really did begin in the Sixties.",3,Wacky Women,1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,4317,"['debut', 'season', 'series', 'plot-wise', 'certainly', 'good', 'enough', 'keep', 'viewers', 'wanting', 'more', 'actors', 'are', 'competent', 'too', 'often', 'are', 'victims', 'overwrought', 'parody-prone', 'direction', 'stolidness', 'performanances', 'truly', 'cinematic', 'offering', 'farcical', 'was', 'meant', 'be.The', 'premiere', 'episodes', 'Mad', 'Men', 'deal', 'legacy', 'Fifties', 'show', 'creators', 'have', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'mocking', 'denigrating', 'decade', 'alone', 'will', 'make', 'low', 'satire', 'entire', 'effort', 'enervated', 'obvious', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'understanding', 'era', 'Even', 'basest', 'forms', 'farce', 'achievement', 'sardonic', 'depends', 'reality', 'foundation', 'failure', 'employ', 'subtlety', 'treatment', 'can', 'doom', 'effectiveness', 'instance', 'series', 'smoking', 'ubiquitous', 'feverish', 'manner', 'never', 'was', 'time', 'activity', 'was', 'accepted', 'almost', 'everywhere', 'people', 'did', 'leisurely', 'was', 'need', 'puff', 'freight', 'train', 'nicotine', 'high', 'non-forbidden', 'zone', 'Many', 'people', 'used', 'matches', 'instead', 'lighters', 'did', ""n't"", 'light', 'up', 'indoors', 'one', 'hand', 'shielding', 'non-existent', 'wind', 'kind', 'exaggeration', 'results', 'not', 'satire', 'burlesque.As', 'pacing', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'are', 'hobbled', 'seemingly', 'desperate', 'impulse', 'inject', 'much', 'anti-Fifties', 'propaganda', 'audience', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'stomach', 'White', 'males', 'are', 'overtly', 'chauvinistic', 'white', 'females', 'overtly', 'compliant', 'blacks', 'sexes', 'menial-working', 'overtly', 'servile', 'covertly', 'surly', 'resentful', 'unhappy', 'people', 'wearisome', 'premises', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'well', 'established', 'then', 'series', 'more', 'deeply', 'plotting.The', 'show', 'lead', 'Dan', 'Draper', 'not', 'manipulative', 'mercenary', 'unscrupulous', 'cut-throat', 'character', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'title', 'sexist', 'viewpoint', 'women', 'well', ""n't"", 'demean', 'prey', 'co-workers', 'on-the-side', 'sex', 'self-competent', 'women', 'affectionate', 'passionate', 'wife.Yet', 'creators', 'compulsion', 'spoof', 'Fifties/Sixties', 'present', 'Mrs.', 'Draper', 'neurotic', 'self-centered', 'suburban', 'housewife', 'who', 'pretty', 'divorcees', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'daughter', 'dead', 'facially', 'scarred', 'children', 'put', 'plastic', 'dry-cleaning', 'covers', 'heads', 'romp', 'unbelted', 'vehicle', 'about', 'pumps', 'crinolined', 'dresses', 'over-the-top', 'image', 'demented', 'Fifties', 'homemaker', 'who', 'earnestly', 'Draper', 'nothing', 'else', 'having', 'sex', 'Indeed', 'have', 'handsome', 'attentive', 'hardworking', 'husband', 'who', 'many', 'women', 'would', 'covet', 'yet', 'coupling', 'milktoasty', 'salesman/stranger', 'somehow', 'orgasms', 'running', 'washing', 'machine', 'then', 'again', 'series', 'only', 'all-together', 'women', 'are', 'promiscuous', 'Even', 'single', 'career', 'women', 'one', 'are', 'portrayed', 'naive', 'frustrated', 'unhealthily', 'guilt-ridden', 'Pre-sexual-revolution', 'females', 'series', 'shouts', 'were', 'mostly', 'miserable', 'creatures', 'who', 'often', 'died', 'childbirth', 'succumbed', 'young', 'dreadful', 'diseases', 'Christianity', 'crippled', 'emotionally', 'intellectually', 'least', 'one', 'case', 'created', 'wicked', 'stepmother', 'time', '1960', 'rolled', 'around', 'were', 'dizzily', 'wearing', 'mismatched', 'clothing', 'draping', 'living', 'room', 'furniture', 'voting', 'Richard', 'Nixon.The', 'problem', 'program', 'lampoon', 'also', 'be', 'serious', 'ongoing', 'serial', 'interest', 'sympathy', 'Dan', 'Draper', ""n't"", 'aid', 'drama', 'stick', 'same', 'style', 'Production-Code', 'pajamas', 'are', 'also', 'donned', 'squirrely', 'co-worker/rival', 'subject', 'character', 'audience', 'alike', 'boring', 'protracted', 'scenes', 'beatnik', 'debauch', 'everyone', 'simply', 'stoned.The', 'best', 'aspect', 'series', 'business', 'intrigue', 'little', 'nothing', 'do', 'show', 'sex', 'often', 'hurried', 'unpassionate', 'toilet-stall', 'encounter', 'strangers', 'Scenes', 'do', 'denote', 'true', 'affection', 'are', 'course', 'subject', 'usual', 'modern-day', 'dread', 'deep', 'kissing', 'actors', 'thus', 'come', 'off', 'chaste', 'staid.The', 'cause', 'latter', 'matter', 'something', 'really', 'did', 'begin', 'Sixties']",Mad Men: Season 1

And be convinced it is good?Mad Men is miserable ""entertainment"" choc-o-bloc with wooden one dimensional characters hobbled by delusions, dalliances and the worst possible writing on a modern day television program. Egotism, sexism, racism, alcoholism, elitism. A crass cavalcade of cliches, you get it all in a filthy little package with Mad Men. It is the largest collection of feckless troglodytes and obsequious toadies I have ever experienced. In fact, the characters are so poorly written and developed that you never get a chance to connect with or feel any empathy or compassion for a single one.WHERE is the humanity?WHERE is the color? There was surely more to the 60's black experience than tending elevators or serving sandwiches to the man. How brazenly backward for the writers and producers of Mad Men to blatantly ignore this pivotal point of cultural history. It makes me gag.Speaking of which, I felt like I got contact emphysema watching this show.  The ubiquitous cancer sticks are more of a crutch than a secondary prop to set the scene. Cigarettes are SO overused that they become a distraction and a lame joke by the middle of the 1st season.  The pervasive poisonous atmosphere ends up being a evanescent yet tangible parallel for the dysfunctional professional and personal relationships that seem to inexplicably implode on every episode. It is a sordid and nihilistic display.There is some redemption for Mad Men.  The clothing, hair and makeup are a magnificent visual feast. Genuinely gorgeous. All of the creative artists and professionals working behind the scenes at Mad Men are a wondrous testament to the magic that happens when you have the right people working together toward a beautiful goal.That said I will add that the profound depth of this visual perfection is Hollywoods dastardly deception.  Because it is precisely these aesthetcs that end up being a grotesque metaphor for the sickening superficial nature of Mad Men.

Her electrifying presence and magnetic radiance illuminate the screen and help raise her primal essence above the utterly pedestrian scripts. Her dazzling talent (as previously seen on ER) is woefully squandered in the flatulent falderol of Mad Men.

1117146,A3C1Q9TRP83BYB,B000YABIQ6,,"[2, 3]","After watching the first few episodes of ""Mad Men"", you can be forgiven if your eyes burn and you start to cough. It might be the only television show in history to cause second-hand smoke. Set in 1960, ""Men Mad"" is really about the 1950's and it captures the spiritual emptiness of the period perfectly. While the Eisenhower era has been romanticized recently as a wonderful time when all Americans had jobs, homes, and cars (and when Republicans were considered ""nice"" people believing in thrift) this fantasy is true only if you were a straight, white male. And a conforming one at that. Still, the emotion that pervades this series is sadness: no one is happy, no matter how many material goodies they have. Even the beatniks are gloomy and dull.The men survive by chain-smoking, drinking themselves insensible and attempting to seduce anything in a skirt. The women are treated to such casual and pervasive sexism that, viewing ""Mad Men"", even conservative women like Phylliss Schlafly will send Gloria Steinem a fruit basket. The women themselves are either the original ""Desperate Housewives"" or trying to stay sane by manipulating the men who prey on them. People of color exist merely as waiters and elevator operators. In the world of 1960 advertising, they are completely non-existent. You see no ads depicting a black or Hispanic family buying a new car, sharing a beer with friends or ogling a new refrigerator. Nor will you for another decade.Centering around the advertising executives of the fictional Sterling-Cooper agency (""Mad Men"" is slang for the admen working on Madison Avenue in New York City, the archetypal Men in the Gray Flannel Suits), ""Mad Men"" succeeds more from mood then plot. The action is focused on the nuances of facial expression that speaks louder than words at a time when true self-expression was unknown and unwanted. The plot itself centers on rising adman star Don Draper (Jon Hamm), who has a secret past and his relationship with his suppressed wife, Betty (January Jones) who, although in therapy, is treated like a dependent child by her analyst who discusses her case only with her husband, not her. Elisabeth Moss shines as Peggy Olson, Draper's new secretary who is ahead of her time in terms of sexual liberation and professional intelligence. When she finally writes copy for a successful ad campaign (unheard of for the women in the office) she is condescendingly offered a drink, a pat on the back but no pay or no position. She chafes under her treatment and one wonders what the coming of the tumultuous Sixies has in store for her.Which bring us to the children of the principal characters. All those cute little tykes running around with cowboy hats and cap guns will, within the coming decade, become hippies, anti-war protesters, feminists and environmental activists. Bob Dylan is still a year away from descending upon the scene but if there ever was a time that needed a'changing, it was 1960 America. The Beatles, Vietnam, and Kennedy's assassination are just around the corner but no one at Sterling-Cooper knows this or even has the imagination to envision the cataclysmic changes about to descend upon them. And when they do happen, will they notice or care?",5,The Eisenhower Era Revisited,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,3227,"['watching', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Mad', 'Men', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'eyes', 'burn', 'start', 'cough', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'television', 'show', 'history', 'cause', 'second-hand', 'smoke', 'Set', '1960', 'Men', 'Mad', 'really', '1950', 'spiritual', 'emptiness', 'period', 'perfectly', 'Eisenhower', 'era', 'been', 'romanticized', 'recently', 'wonderful', 'time', 'when', 'Americans', 'had', 'jobs', 'homes', 'cars', 'when', 'Republicans', 'were', 'considered', 'nice', 'people', 'believing', 'thrift', 'fantasy', 'true', 'only', 'were', 'straight', 'white', 'male', 'conforming', 'one', 'Still', 'emotion', 'series', 'sadness', 'one', 'happy', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'material', 'goodies', 'have', 'Even', 'beatniks', 'are', 'gloomy', 'dull.The', 'men', 'survive', 'chain-smoking', 'drinking', 'insensible', 'attempting', 'seduce', 'anything', 'skirt', 'women', 'are', 'treated', 'such', 'casual', 'pervasive', 'sexism', 'viewing', 'Mad', 'Men', 'even', 'conservative', 'women', 'Phylliss', 'Schlafly', 'will', 'send', 'Gloria', 'Steinem', 'fruit', 'basket', 'women', 'are', 'either', 'original', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'trying', 'stay', 'sane', 'manipulating', 'men', 'who', 'prey', 'People', 'color', 'exist', 'merely', 'waiters', 'elevator', 'operators', 'world', '1960', 'advertising', 'are', 'completely', 'non-existent', 'see', 'ads', 'depicting', 'black', 'Hispanic', 'family', 'buying', 'new', 'car', 'sharing', 'beer', 'friends', 'ogling', 'new', 'refrigerator', 'will', 'decade.Centering', 'advertising', 'executives', 'fictional', 'Sterling-Cooper', 'agency', 'Mad', 'Men', 'slang', 'admen', 'working', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'archetypal', 'Men', 'Gray', 'Flannel', 'Suits', 'Mad', 'Men', 'more', 'mood', 'then', 'plot', 'action', 'focused', 'nuances', 'facial', 'expression', 'louder', 'words', 'time', 'when', 'true', 'self-expression', 'was', 'unknown', 'unwanted', 'plot', 'centers', 'rising', 'adman', 'star', 'Don', 'Draper', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'who', 'secret', 'past', 'relationship', 'suppressed', 'wife', 'Betty', 'January', 'Jones', 'who', 'therapy', 'treated', 'dependent', 'child', 'analyst', 'who', 'case', 'only', 'husband', 'not', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'shines', 'Peggy', 'Olson', 'Draper', 'new', 'secretary', 'who', 'ahead', 'time', 'terms', 'sexual', 'liberation', 'professional', 'intelligence', 'When', 'finally', 'copy', 'successful', 'ad', 'campaign', 'unheard', 'women', 'office', 'condescendingly', 'offered', 'drink', 'pat', 'back', 'pay', 'position', 'chafes', 'treatment', 'one', 'what', 'coming', 'tumultuous', 'Sixies', 'store', 'her.Which', 'bring', 'children', 'principal', 'characters', 'cute', 'little', 'tykes', 'running', 'around', 'cowboy', 'hats', 'cap', 'guns', 'will', 'coming', 'decade', 'become', 'hippies', 'anti-war', 'protesters', 'feminists', 'environmental', 'activists', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'still', 'year', 'away', 'descending', 'scene', 'ever', 'was', 'time', 'needed', ""a'changing"", 'was', '1960', 'America', 'Beatles', 'Vietnam', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'are', 'just', 'corner', 'one', 'Sterling-Cooper', 'even', 'imagination', 'envision', 'cataclysmic', 'changes', 'descend', 'when', 'do', 'happen', 'will', 'notice', 'care']",Mad Men: Season 1
1117147,A2DT00ZK4WGOQH,B000YABIQ6,,"[2, 3]","With the possible exception of Deadwood - HBO's magnificent Shakespearean noir-western - Mad Men defies easy comparison with virtually any television drama ever made. While much has already been written on the program's stunning recreation of mid-century cultural/corporate atmospherics and the big swinging casualness of its fidelity is optional lifestyle, the real focus for me is Sterling Cooper's creative chieftain, Don Draper.He is a man of compromised emotion and is quite literally as ephemeral as the Brands he champions.Draper's life is a canard, based entirely on an identity stolen from one of his dead Korean War comrades - with his lineage, education, breeding and comportment all fabrications in the service of his assumed identity. His wife is a prop to whom he owes no allegiance - his co-workers ""necessaries"" in the propagation of his fraud.His is the ultimate fantasy played out within an industry that chews it like Pez. Draper's essence is one of physical inflection married to the danger of living in one's own head - where dialogue becomes superfluous, dangerous and far too revealing. It is the program's singular pleasure to watch Jon Hamm inhabit the role with such detached earnestness as if living on the brink of detection with every breath. His is a morality play of which Deadwood's Al Swearangen could be proud - and slightly envious.Draper is far from the only thing in Mad Men worth watching. The entire supporting cast is outstanding led by Draper's wife Betty, played by January Jones.

1117148,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B000YABIQ6,,"[2, 4]","Standing out against a backdrop containing a depressing number of boring sitcoms, brain-dead reality shows, and interchangeable law-enforcment procedurals, Mad Men is the kind of show that's been hastening my abandonment of network TV over the past several years.  Chronicling a year (roughly) in the life of Madison Avenue ad agency Sterling Cooper, Mad Men enfolds an unapologetic look at early-1960's American society into an intelligent and occasionally comedic drama series.  While the massive buzz might suggest otherwise, Mad Men is not in fact the best thing to happen to TV since color--the pacing could use some work, and the dialogue isn't always as clever or profound as it's obviously meant to be--but it's still nice to see a show this unabashedly cool and thoroughly absorbing.  Largely forgoing contrived plot twists and tiresome histrionics, the show instead breezes by on its unforced charm and subtle character dynamics.  Much has been made of the Mad Men's exacting recreation of a bygone era, and that attention to detail spills into every aspect of the show, giving it a colorful, vivid look and feel unlike anything else on TV.  Even when the characters aren't doing anything consequential, as in a late-season episode showing the staff killing time during the presidential election with the bosses gone, it's a blast just to watch them hang out.Like many of the best shows of the past decade or so (think The Shield, The Wire, The Sopranos, etc.), Mad Men manages to juggle multiple plot and character arcs, generally bringing things along slowly until the pace accelerates in the wrenching final few episodes.  At the same time, its novel setting in the early 1960's and its high levels of personal, professional ,and sexual intrigue ensure that it manages to stand on its own as a compelling watch.  Especially fascinating is seeing the freewheeling portrayal of behaviors now considered archaic if not outright evil: rampant adultery and sexist objectification, smoking (even during pregnancy!), drunk driving, and, in one strangely alluring scene, the main character's mega-babe wife shooting the neighbor's birds in her backyard while puffing away on a cigarette.  Even though the show depicts a great deal of what would now be considered misbehavior, it never passes judgment on its characters or their era, nor does it engage in pointless nostalgia.  It just presents likeably flawed characters living by the conventions of a different time and leaves viewers to judge for themselves.While Mad Men does an admirable job of developing a sizeable ensemble cast(which has continued in its even better second season), there's no question that the central character in the drama is Don Draper, Sterling Cooper's vaguely mysterious creative director.  Played in career-making fashion by the suitably stoic and square-jawed Jon Hamm, Don is easily one of the most unpredictable and inscrutable leading men on TV, not quite a hero and not quite an anti-hero, but a compelling figure nonetheless.  My wife succintly described him as a ""jerk,"" and while that label isn't entirely inaccurate, the writers gradually fill in the details of Don's past and reveal what's going on beneath his seemingly soulless exterior.  Even as he drinks heavily, cheats on his wife, and belittles subordinates, it's somehow easy to forgive Don his flaws, especially as the season wears on and the writers take us further into his head.  Similarly, a collection of (somewhat) ancillary characters who may intially seem one-note--reserved secretary Peggy Olsen, hard-living boss Roger Sterling, Machiavellian striver Pete Campbell, seductive office manager Joan Holloway--have their own aspirations and internal conflicts come out over time.Mixing single-episode plots with longer storylines, along with the running thread of the Nixon-Kennedy presidential race (with Sterling Cooper working for Nixon), Mad Men has a lot going on from the very first episode.  For a show as busy and ambitious as it is, though, Mad Men remains extremely restrained and consistent, with few deviations from its focus on character and setting.  I for one found the plots focusing on Don's home life and his romantic entanglements less interesting than the show's examination of the workings of a business circa 1960 and the psychological underpinnings of advertising, but pretty much everyone should be able to find something here to enjoy.  Throughout its first season Mad Men keeps the complexity level high and rarely panders to its audience, which are qualities that just about everyone should be able to get behind.",4,"A bit

There is just way too much overly cute foreshadowing in a junkyard of 1950s cliches and stereotypes.And for everything they got right in terms of the city and business, they got something wrong about life in the suburbs. What was missing was the ambitious cuthroat wives of the suburbs and the wives who didn't care what went on in the city as far as affairs as long as the goodies came in. They are too tied up in a one-dimensional world of ""wife-as-victim"". That was part of the era, but not the whole thing.The final episode really killed things. The entire season told a very good and compelling story which turned into a melodramatic soap opera series of ""shock revelations"" which undercut everything built to over twelve episodes.Everyone involved deserves tremendous praise for having so unexpectedly put together something like this.

Set in 1960 and focusing on a fictional advertising agency Sterling Cooper, the show tells the story of ad men in a haze of cigarette smoke and booze.  The first episode foreshadows the change in our culture as the firm struggles to find a new advertising campaign for Lucky Strike cigarettes now that the government won't allow them to use testimonials from doctors that cigarettes are safe.  The show is fanatical with its attention to period detail.  Show creator Matthew Weiner has extensively researched the products, clothes and just about everything else from the period and has created a picture perfect time warp. But that is just a shiny veneer for the deep and dark storylines that include a secret past with a changed identity, depression, heart attacks, infidelity and so many others.  The show shoots off in so many directions, yet never loses focus.  The anchor of the show is Jon Hamm who plays the main character Don Draper.

1117156,A65D3EGFDW6SZ,B000YABIQ6,,"[3, 4]","FABULOUS, FABULOUS!  Better than Sopranos, which is better than anything else on TV.Obviously I wholeheartedly agree with most previous reviews. I just want to add my two cents to highlight some areas that I think reviewers didn't quite do justice to:1. Don's Wife:  Betty Draper is often stereotyped by reviewers as being a gorgeous ""childlike"" Stepford wife type.  I disagree. There is much more to her than meets the superficial eye.  She is a woman with beautifully portrayed ambivalence--she revels in, and dazzles us, in her in her breezy handling of her assigned role as gorgeous, loving, devoted wife and mother, and housewife.  But, inside, there is depression, loneliness, alienation, and even anger and a sense of entrapment.  Indeed, her lines reveal this at almost every turn.  On the one hand, she is clearly an opinion leader among her neighborhood girlfriends, (e.g. in her persuading her friends to show some tolerance and sympathy for the divorcee who just joined the neighborhood), and she is a complete equal in her intelligent repartees with Don.  On the other hand, she is a nervous hostess, full of anxiety to put on the perfect birthday party for her little girl, and she is afflicted with some scary psychosomatic numbness and shaking in her hands, which lead her to the 1960s shrink's couch.  Her relationship with Don is a beautifully scripted and choreographed blend of real love, with a partnership of openness and honesty with regard to all of their SHARED life, battling with deception, and clandestine played out escape fantasies in each of their private lives.2. As many reviewers comment, Mad Men is a real gem of a presentation of an anti-PC, ""in your face"" 1960s world.  BUT, it doesn't simply flaunt and revel in the ""capitalist"", ""materialistic"", ""vice-ridden"" culture.Far from glorifying this lifestyle, it displays, indeed very much wants to capture the viewer's attention to, all the darkness, the traps, the alienation, the Darwinian competition, and the sickness, that this world creates!  Indeed, this very unapologetic flamboyant, and gorgeous, movie quality TV show, treats the viewer with a rare degree of respect--the viewer sees it as it really was, and judges without interference or propaganda, for him or her self.

1117157,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000YABIQ6,,"[3, 5]","A surprising American series indeed. And yet it is fascinating. Nostalgia first. 1960 with the duel between Nixon and Kennedy. It is amazing to recapture these old pictures and these old events, and the reactions of some people to the events that were going to become historical if not frankly historic. Nostalgia too with the presence, excessive presence, total submersion if not flood of tobacco smoke in these episodes. I defy you to just feel like following them and chain, double chain, triple chain smoke the way they do. They kiss and smoke at the same time, smoking through their nostrils or their ears I guess. Was there a place where we could not smoke in those days? I don't even remember a non-smoking area, except maybe on trains, one compartment per carriage, when there were compartments. Smoke detectors were not trendy yet. Still  nostalgic but in another style and direction with the Korean war, but in a dramatic way: a lieutenant being killed and his identity assumed by the only witness, a simple soldier from nowhere who volunteered in the war to escape his own family he hated completely and utterly. The film is cruel about this episode, and yet the man is a success story on the basis of a college diploma he never passed, but who cares? No one of course. No deserting, no real criminal act, except the exchange of a dog tag with a dead officer. But then the nostalgia is quite tempered by the insight the other questions that are evoked here bring about some further evolution in society. The main and central problem is that of women. These women who were supposed to be beautiful to just find a husband through some work, at times, but not too much, then make two children, a boy and a girl if possible, and take care of the family home without letting any stranger cross the threshold. Those who worked real hard were not envisaging a housewife career but rather a plain career, be it social, economic, artistic or whatever. They were the new postwar generations of women who decided that the housewife fate was not for them, and anyway the economy required them to work and the incomes of workers and the new needs and consuming possibilities required a second income in the home. Here the film is quite clear about the motivations of women, of working women as well as of housewives. They want to have their say in things, their independence in life, the recognition of their personality and identity. The series is cruel though at times, but so true. Cruel with these housewives who are so bored that they waste their time on checking the phone calls of their husbands, and finding out about their affairs, the good old western Christian or Jewish polygamy. Cruel about the women who use their sex appeal or their yielding to the sexual appetite of the men around them just for their vanity and to have some small presents and advantages, like a canary in a cage. Cruel when a woman gets some authority over another woman and over-uses it, abuses it and even abuses the girl or woman she is supposed to take care of. But the worst cruelty is against all the macho phallocratic men who behave with women as if they were servants, subservient, as if they had to be crawling at their feet and obsequiously submissive. The men are odious, purely idiotic, blind but also conscious at times that something was evading and escaping them, that women, married or not, wives or not, Jewish or not, were taking over the territory that was becoming theirs, the family, their desk space, their waste paper basket, their box in the personnel lounge, etc. We just wonder if things were really like that and we have to remember that yes they were and yes they were changing in that direction. The last thing I would like to say on that series, I mean the first season of that series, is that there is a lot of humor nearly everywhere, and at times, quite often indeed, sad humor, but humor all the same like about the Jews who are still ghettoized, or a lesbian woman who is nicely diplomatically negotiated by her room mate, or a gay man who is curtly and coldly pushed back by the closet homo who does not want to admit it. We are still in 1960 and Kennedy has not been elected yet and the real battle about civil rights is just starting in a way, for the Blacks. The Jews are maybe slightly different, but the gay and lesbian people are far from the beginning of the decision to just open the door of the closet one inch to see if there is anyone in there. I must admit it is good to look back, not in anger but in shame and in gratefulness, at times that have changed in this period that was just the very first step towards real freedom in our countries, and we are still far from the fulfillment of Roosevelt's promise about the four freedoms. By the way, what about the freedom from want in the healthcare field of poverty and misery, what about top notch surgery for a coronary accident of a homeless person?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University

The titles pay homage to graphic designer Saul Bass's skyscraper filled opening titles for Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959) and falling man movie poster for Vertigo (1958) - Weiner has listed Hitchcock as a major influence on the visual style of the series.I was not impressed with the openining titles even knowing the above, it just for me did not fit in with era, and watching the 1st 2 episodes does not compliment it in anyway, it looks cheap.Don Draper(Jon Hamm) and Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss aka Zoey Bartlet The West Wing) carry the first 2 episodes.

1117160,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B000YABIQ6,,"[3, 8]","Normally, I avoid new shows on TV. After all nowadays, you begin to watch a show, really get into it, and in a few weeks it's cancelled because it's not pulling the demographic the network wants. So, I just wait to hear about the buzz surrounding a show before tuning in, usually after the first season has finished and people are still talking about it. Which is exactly how I discovered AMC's intriguing show ""Mad Men"", just releasing the disks and starting season two this past week.It's very easy to see how this show can be seen with two sets of eyes, and gleam two contrary sets of meanings from Mad Men. The first set of eyes may watch this show and think, ""Oh, if only life was like that again"". They may pine for the ""good ol' days"", where everyone smoked everywhere, women were room decorations for men to ogle, drinking at work was the norm, even if you were driving or having a child, and men ruled the universe. The men worked long hard hours, and having affairs seemed to be the norm. In other words, the good old days.The second set of eyes watches Mad Men and cannot help be frustrated and angry at the sexist, racist, homophobic society they are watching. Men openly tell sexist jokes that demean the secretaries in the office, and laugh loudly about it. At a party, another account exec chases a secretary, tackles her, and hikes up her skirt to show everyone her underwear. Two African-American people were fired after some money was stolen from a locker, even though one of them wasn't even in the building at the time. These eyes watch these events and think, ""I hope we've come farther than this.""At first, watching this show, I didn't know what to make of it. Certainly I subscribe to the second pair of eyes, and wondered if this show was going to be constantly degrading populations of people. If so, that isn't entertainment. As the show gradually unfolds, I began to realize that wasn't the direction the show was going in. In fact, I couldn't honestly tell you what direction it was going in.When spunky and talented new secretary Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) leaves some copy with office nefario and universal jerk Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser, where did this talented actor come from?), you'd expect the usual ""He steals the copy as tries to pawn it off as his own"", knowing full well he would do that, and Peggy would be left with no repercussions.  Only creator and writer Matthew Weiner is much too smart for that. Instead, Pete never even gives the copy any attention at all, which is more revealing of his character and the times. Score one for Weiner.So the first season zigs and zags, and I found myself angered at times, surprised at times, and laughing at times. Jon Hamm plays the main character Donald Draper with such a 50's ruggedness, he could easily be plucked into any 50's film and immediately fill in. Ad whiz kid, Don carries a secret, and it's not his mistress or a Jewish department store manager that hires his firm. The secret to his identity was an interesting story, but one that ultimately wasn't too ""big"" when revealed. His affairs against his Grace Kelly look-a-like wife Betty played by Janaury Jones, are extremely frustrating to me. His virtuous persona jars against his philandering, and that probably makes his character ultimately more interesting. Betty herself has more problems of her own, numb hands, an unethical psychiatrist, and a new divorcee in the 'hood.For me, the show all comes back to Peggy. I hope beyond hope that Weiner has great plans for Peggy. Taken by itself, the first season of Mad Men could be frustrating, but knowing that women's rights began to emerge in the 60's, I'm hoping among hope that Peggy's journey will represent that eventual change. As Don recognizes her talent, she moves from the secretary pool to junior copy writer. Let's hope that more men at Sterling and Cooper recognize her talent. Both her and Don together make an amazing professional team. I can see her speaking at his retirement dinner in the 1980's, she has founded her own advertising firm and credits her early start to him.So, I went from some confusion, to anger, to liking the show, to really liking it. Can I say that I love the show? Not yet, thus the four star rating. I'm eagerly going to watch season two. I have to give kudos to AMC for producing this show. It's about time that interesting, provocative television series move from the limited availability that pay-per-view channels provide, into the cable that is available to anyone with a box.

1117161,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B000YABIQ6,,"[4, 12]","In America there was a thing called the culture wars. The right said that up till the sixties things had been going well. The family unit was solid and because it was solid the nation was solid. The key to keeping the family together was strict sexual morality, the acceptance of woman as a home maker and the importance of raising children with strong values. If children had values they did not break the law, worked hard and society prospered.Along came the sixties and women had conflicting roles. Morality fell apart and the divorce rate went through roof. Single familles were thrown into poverty and crime became rampant. The culture war was an attack on the changes in society in the latter half of the twentieth century which saw the emancipation of woman, ending laws against homosexuality and the development of governmental roles to improve society.This series appears to be a strong counter attack against the right suggesting a new model of what the fifties were like. It suggests that the developments in the sixties were against a society of the fifties seeped in racism, homophobia and misogyny.Part of the appeal of the series seems to be a smug satisfaction by the viewer of how much things are better now and what repellent creeps are portrayed in the show. On a superficial level the characters smoke constantly, drink to excess and eat food drenched in dairy products. Anyone seeing the show now would realise that this sort of behaviour would lead to a life expectancy of about fifty. The male characters are white and who despise Jews. Any contact with women is predatory.And of course there is some truth in the picture. If you want women to not have sexual contact prior to marriage and not to engage in affairs there must be strong social prohibitions in place. Whilst the fifties might have seen lower rates of pre-marital sex it was a period when terms such as ""slut"", ""mole"" and ""whore"" were not only in use but could be used to achieve social exclusion. A society which has ""strong morality"" is a society which is intolerant, judgemental and exclusive.The major problem with the show is not so much the politics it espouses. Rather it is rather slow moving. One is not so much interested in the development of the story. Rather it is like watching a train wreck. It is a bit repellent but you feel compelled to watch it never the less.",3,Mad Men the sixties strike back,1228348800,"12 4, 2008",2008,2366,"['America', 'was', 'thing', 'called', 'culture', 'wars', 'right', 'said', 'up', 'till', 'sixties', 'things', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'well', 'family', 'unit', 'was', 'solid', 'was', 'solid', 'nation', 'was', 'solid', 'key', 'keeping', 'family', 'together', 'was', 'strict', 'sexual', 'morality', 'acceptance', 'woman', 'home', 'maker', 'importance', 'raising', 'children', 'strong', 'values', 'children', 'had', 'values', 'did', 'not', 'break', 'law', 'worked', 'hard', 'society', 'prospered.Along', 'came', 'sixties', 'women', 'had', 'conflicting', 'roles', 'Morality', 'fell', 'apart', 'divorce', 'rate', 'went', 'roof', 'Single', 'familles', 'were', 'thrown', 'poverty', 'crime', 'became', 'rampant', 'culture', 'war', 'was', 'attack', 'changes', 'society', 'latter', 'half', 'twentieth', 'century', 'saw', 'emancipation', 'woman', 'ending', 'laws', 'homosexuality', 'development', 'governmental', 'roles', 'improve', 'society.This', 'series', 'be', 'strong', 'counter', 'attack', 'right', 'suggesting', 'new', 'model', 'what', 'fifties', 'were', 'developments', 'sixties', 'were', 'society', 'fifties', 'seeped', 'racism', 'homophobia', 'misogyny.Part', 'appeal', 'series', 'be', 'smug', 'satisfaction', 'viewer', 'how', 'much', 'things', 'are', 'better', 'now', 'what', 'repellent', 'creeps', 'are', 'portrayed', 'show', 'superficial', 'level', 'characters', 'smoke', 'constantly', 'drink', 'excess', 'eat', 'food', 'drenched', 'dairy', 'products', 'Anyone', 'seeing', 'show', 'now', 'would', 'realise', 'sort', 'behaviour', 'would', 'lead', 'life', 'expectancy', 'fifty', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'white', 'who', 'despise', 'Jews', 'Any', 'contact', 'women', 'predatory.And', 'course', 'truth', 'picture', 'want', 'women', 'not', 'have', 'sexual', 'contact', 'prior', 'marriage', 'not', 'engage', 'affairs', 'must', 'be', 'strong', 'social', 'prohibitions', 'place', 'fifties', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'lower', 'rates', 'pre-marital', 'sex', 'was', 'period', 'when', 'terms', 'such', 'slut', 'mole', 'whore', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'use', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'achieve', 'social', 'exclusion', 'society', 'strong', 'morality', 'society', 'intolerant', 'judgemental', 'exclusive.The', 'major', 'problem', 'show', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'politics', 'Rather', 'rather', 'slow', 'moving', 'One', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'interested', 'development', 'story', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'bit', 'repellent', 'feel', 'compelled', 'watch', 'never', 'less']",Mad Men: Season 1
1117162,A1BU237PT26N5J,B000YABIQ6,,"[4, 7]","After the 5th episode, I was beginning to think that I needed a drink.  Maybe if I was drunk I'd give this series 5 stars.  No wonder these people drank and smoked their brains out...their lives were so dull.  ""Madmen"" is not an exciting piece of work but a nice showcase of the 60s advertising industry and how it influenced and shaped American culture and consumerism. The script, art direction, and acting are intelligently well crafted and depict the facade of the era well. Unfortunately, most of the characters are still forgettable although the character development is obvious throughout. Plus, each episode drags and the delivery couldn't get any less climactic.  It took 10 episodes for me to finally get ""hooked"".  The story material is very dense and dry at times.  This series can't be easily watched in one sitting like others.  There are very subtle details that I think the average viewer would have a hard time noticing, let alone appreciating.  ""Madmen"" isn't for the average viewer of course.

1117163,AU503HFYAB0IG,B000YABIQ6,,"[4, 7]","I think this show is very well produced and it's premise and setting is promising, but it's not a patch on the quality of a program like 'The Sopranos', from where it's creator Matt Weiner hails as a writer. I was initially disappointed in the 'stylized' performances in Mad Men as, in the wake of the Sopranos, I found the prospect of a realistically performed collection of early sixties characters very exciting. Unfortunately, despite the darker themes of the program, it is really a series of TV performances (ie the way we imagine 1960's characters to behave via our experience of their television). Thus there is no cursing, no genuine intimacy and a strange contrivance about all involved. It's a shame, especially when you can see a film like 'Revolutionary Road' pulling off just the sort of honesty and performance style that we might hope for from Mad Men. Other than that the program suffers from strangely judgmental moments, and others cloyingly obvious and Spielberg-esque. The Sopranos was never guilty of either of these crimes.For judging, take the 'easy' criticism of the hippie characters that Draper visits (and dowses them with the predictable 'Get a job' criticism) - actually some of their criticisms of Draper were very interesting but they were marred by obvious, cliched portrayals of hippies. If Draper had've witnessed a Dylan concert in the Village or something nearing it's quality, he might have felt very inferior indeed. As it is, he has to sit through poetry so bad, only a cynical scriptwriter could've prepared it.For cloying, witness the awful flashbacks to Draper's childhood, portrayed with such obvious message-mongering they border on condescension of the audience. Yes, we get it, Draper's dad was a 'bad man'. The most obvious shortfall of the program is it's inability to deliver us genuinely sympathetic and involving characters. The closest are Peggy and Draper's wife - but even they are basically shallow puppets caught up in the oh so important world of advertising. The show has two big things going for it; It's early 60's style is fresh and it has learned from The Sopranos that unpredictability is a compelling way to explore an ensemble cast. Other than that, time will get the better of this program.",3,"Mad Men promises much, but falls short",1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,2257,"['think', 'show', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'premise', 'setting', 'promising', 'not', 'patch', 'quality', 'program', ""'The"", 'Sopranos', 'where', 'creator', 'Matt', 'Weiner', 'writer', 'was', 'initially', 'disappointed', ""'stylized"", 'performances', 'Mad', 'Men', 'wake', 'Sopranos', 'found', 'prospect', 'realistically', 'performed', 'collection', 'early', 'sixties', 'characters', 'very', 'exciting', 'Unfortunately', 'darker', 'themes', 'program', 'really', 'series', 'TV', 'performances', 'ie', 'way', 'imagine', '1960', 'characters', 'behave', 'experience', 'television', 'Thus', 'cursing', 'genuine', 'intimacy', 'strange', 'contrivance', 'involved', 'shame', 'especially', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'film', ""'Revolutionary"", 'Road', 'pulling', 'off', 'just', 'sort', 'honesty', 'performance', 'style', 'might', 'hope', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Other', 'program', 'suffers', 'strangely', 'judgmental', 'moments', 'others', 'cloyingly', 'obvious', 'Spielberg-esque', 'Sopranos', 'was', 'never', 'guilty', 'crimes.For', 'judging', 'take', ""'easy"", 'criticism', 'hippie', 'characters', 'Draper', 'visits', 'predictable', ""'Get"", 'job', 'criticism', 'actually', 'criticisms', 'Draper', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'were', 'marred', 'obvious', 'cliched', 'portrayals', 'hippies', 'Draper', 'had', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'Dylan', 'concert', 'Village', 'something', 'nearing', 'quality', 'might', 'have', 'felt', 'very', 'inferior', 'indeed', 'sit', 'poetry', 'so', 'bad', 'only', 'cynical', 'scriptwriter', 'could', ""'ve"", 'prepared', 'it.For', 'cloying', 'awful', 'flashbacks', 'Draper', 'childhood', 'portrayed', 'such', 'obvious', 'message-mongering', 'border', 'condescension', 'audience', 'Yes', 'get', 'Draper', 'dad', 'was', ""'bad"", 'man', 'most', 'obvious', 'shortfall', 'program', 'inability', 'deliver', 'genuinely', 'sympathetic', 'involving', 'characters', 'closest', 'are', 'Peggy', 'Draper', 'wife', 'even', 'are', 'basically', 'shallow', 'puppets', 'caught', 'up', 'oh', 'so', 'important', 'world', 'advertising', 'show', 'two', 'big', 'things', 'going', 'early', '60', 'style', 'fresh', 'learned', 'Sopranos', 'unpredictability', 'compelling', 'way', 'explore', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Other', 'time', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'program']",Mad Men: Season 1

Aside from one editing glitch (involving a woman's cigarette that is held upward then lapward then upward a number of times), my main ""glitch watch"" observation surrounds a home-movie camera that is treated like a videocamera:  lacking intense lights clamped to chairs for indoor shooting, lacking the need to hand-wind the film every few feet, or lacking the whir of a motor.(It's also a kick to see Angel's karate-wheeling son emerge here as a lesser corporate demon.  Perhaps Season 3 can link up his character with his own long-lost brother, played by Wil Wheaton.)This series's main competition for Emmy awards is the excellent DAMAGES.  But depraved nastiness is an easy staple for cable shows, while the intricacy of MAD MEN (without excessive, facile cussing and with a minimum of wish-fulfillment fantasy sequences) sets it apart from the conventions of even the best of television dramas.The series is just about as fantastic as it lauds itself for being, on the commentaries.  Its creator ""loves"" everything, and other commentary participants slobber big wet kisses on each other--as has become a tradition in disk packages of this kind.  Clearly deserved for costuming and set design, also appropriate for writing and performances, yes; but pointing out parallel themes (a la THE WIRE) is a frequent achievement of greater value.Some of the technical commentaries (notably on costuming, producing, editing, directing) are as good as any ""field trip"" classes I took in grad school, with production personnel at various Manhattan television stations.  Film teachers would do well to assign these commentaries at any level of ""film production"" instruction.This, however, is countered by the endless redundancy of Elizabeth Moss who, as Peggy Olsen, does a good acting job but, on the commentaries, finds a dozen ways to repeat the same simplistic idea ... over and over and over and over throughout many, many episodes.  It's nice to have so many commentaries on the disks, but this actress's vacuous chatter is too often used as filler.  She is clearly the production's mascot, but her additions to commentaries for Season 2 should be edited judiciously.Immediately after watching these 13 episodes about the ad industry in 1960, I viewed MADISON AVENUE (1962) with Dana Andrews as a somewhat older, less complicated clone of Dan Draper, a love interest named Peggy, a Joan-like secretary named Miss Olsen, the actor who later played Larry Tate from BEWITCHED here performing the role of a precursor of Tate, and even the line ""You haven't thought this through.""

Discussing this Series with my wife, I absentmindedly said, about the character of Don Draper, played by Jon Hamm, ""He's a good man.""  She said, ""No he isn't!""  I then realized, and told my wife, ""That's how he gets away with it!""  What does he get away with?  Well, everything.  He is such a good point man for the company the owner/boss does not care when the weasel tells the boss about his identity theft. A side issue there is, of course, the weasel, Pete, who has committed a Federal crime by opening mail that is not his, is so smart he is stupid.  Why? It's the same reason Draper willingly takes him into the boss's office to reveal the ID theft, realizing that Pete is not realizing that the real big killer info is that Draper is a Jew. Don might as well quickly take Pete up on his threat to go to the boss, rather than submit to blackmail, as soon as possible before Pete gets around to thinking about the real career killer, right? That is not in the show yet, but I bet it will be, eventually. (Wonder why Don got along so well with Rachel?) If Pete had deduced that, then Draper would never take him to the boss.  Telling the boss about an upsetting issue the boss would not care about is a whole lot different than the worst thing anyone, anywhere, even his wife could find out. Notice how Don did not hesitate taking Pete to the boss?  You wait.  At least that is what I would be writing into the scripts. With the archaic attitudes of that company's brass, about Jews, that info would have gotten Draper fired and blacklisted, which, of course, from our point of view now days is about as stupid as smoking all the time.  Thank heavens things have evolved!Don's wife is played so well.  Don is so good at everything she is happy to be the zero she is. Constantly made aware of how lucky she is, she sits in agonizing unhappiness, the reason for which she cannot explain nor express even to herself. She is so unhappy.  They all are.  This show is so well done that it ranks right up there with the best of Shakespearian Tragedies.

1117168,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,B000YABIQ6,,"[6, 12]","I have heard people rave about this show and how smartly written it is, and how well it captures the atmosphere of the 1960s. It doesn't. It captures the LOOK of the '60s brilliantly, but otherwise, it's a caricature of that era. EVERY male character is a despicable, philandering, sexist pig who leads a pathetically empty life devoid of real meaning. Every suburban scene positively drips with the implication that these people all live utterly superficial, meaningless, shallow, phony lives, wearing polite smiles that they show each other, even as they connive and gossip maliciously behind each others' backs. And no one, but NO ONE is actually happy.  Every man and woman walks through life like a robot, doing what's expected and appropriate, and all secretly unhappy and unfulfilled.  There are no characters who really like their jobs, no husbands and fathers who truly love their wives and children, no wives who are genuinely happy to be raising their kids because they love them and love motherhood, etc.  What we seem to have here is an overreaction to the classic ""Leave It To Beaver"" or ""Father Knows Best"" view of life presented in the shows of this era.  If those shows over-sanitized life and presented a too idealized vision of American life, then I think this one goes too far in the other direction, and tries to make life back then look stylish and sharp on the surface, but totally rotten, corrupt, cheap, and ugly underneath.  The truth almost certainly lies somewhere in between.Take a look at how people behave on this show.  While I'm sure sexism and sexual harassment were a bit worse back then, it simply couldn't have been THIS bad. In one scene, in the first episode, one of the young executives looks a new girl up and down like a piece of meat, and then proceeds to offer gratuitous and explicit criticism of her her appearance and advice on how to sex herself up, right to her face. Come on! Sexual harassment was, as I said, probably worse back then, but this is outrageously rude behavior by ANY standard, and I know that simple good manners and politeness did exist back then.  The same character then asks this girls boss when he can have his turn with her, as though it simply goes without saying that she'll sleep with him; it's just a regular perk that goes along with the job, like having a key to the executive washroom.  Later on, another male character, who hasn't been so crude, spends a little time building rapport with this same girl, and she's glad to meet someone who appears genuinely nice and friendly.  And then the next thing you know, he gets her in an office, locks the door, and tries to start taking her clothes off.  Message loud and clear: he's just like all the rest.  Now really, was there ever a time when ALL men just took it for granted that every attractive woman was available and willing, and any woman who is nice to a guy will just roll onto her back for him at the first opportunity?  I don't think so.And the writer's portrayal of racism, and classism is every bit as much a caricature as their portrayal of sexism.

1117169,A8IHLMGDIOK8L,B000YABIQ6,,"[6, 19]","I have now re-watched Mad Men, Season One, a number of times and my opinion of it has improved, though I still find the lead characters, Don and Betty Draper, to be insufferable.  He's a cad, a liar, a jerk, an egomaniac, totally devoid of humor and not very bright into the bargain.  Betty is an empty-headed, selfish, childish, vindictive bitch, and she's not a very good mother, either.  The actress playing her should be booted from SAG.  She should at least be given elocution lessons and taught how to pronounce contracted words, like 'wouldn't', 'shouldn't' and 'didn't'  which, from her pouting little lips come out, 'wunt' 'shunt' and 'dint'.Regardless, I am hooked on Mad Men!  Though it is still impossible to believe that Peggy Olson did not know she was pregnant until she gives birth!  Don's history is also a stretch but his secret hillbilly background lays the foundations for some depth in his story.I have purchased the subsequent seasons (2 & 3) and await Season 4's release on dvd.  I don't have cable or satellite, not just for one show worth watching, so I have to wait with bated breath.  The series got much better after Season 1.Mad Men is like an evil Dick Van Dyke show.  It's often very funny and the characters, beyond the Draper couple, are well-drawn and complex.  There is some fine acting by Elisabeth Moss (Peggy Olson) and Vincent Kartheiser (Peter Campbell).And I love Joan Holloway played by Christina Hendricks.Recommended, but the kids probably won't liked it.

1117171,A1MIFU0YKLG40T,B000YABIQ6,,"[6, 9]","AMC once again proves itself a worthy adversary to HBO and Showtime for producing a quality and highly literate television experience. Time spent viewing ""Mad Men"" is not a passive couch potato exercise calculated to generate a momentary knot of personal nostalgia. The experience is much more than that. Like ""The Apartment,"" a major motion picture released in 1960 and mentioned in this series captures the very essence of big city urban 1960 culture and is utterly convincingly in ways both broad and subtle. The look and feel of the time is spot on. Some of what is defined in ""Mad Men"" may shock current PC culture sensibilities as relates to race and gender relations. At its core, ""Mad Men"" provides the viewer with a blistering and not too flattering look at ourselves and our entrenched culture of consumerism as strong today as it was nearly a half century ago. Jon Hamm leads an inspired cast of little known actors portraying reticent and mysterious Donald Draper, a highly sought after ad man and selling genius. Elisabeth Moss gets second billing as Peggy Olsen, Draper's wide-eyed new secretary. Moss's acting resume includes a stint as young Zoey Bartlett, daughter of the President in ""West Wing.""  As for Hamm, he would make a convincing James Bond and depending upon the camera angle, ever present obscuring cigarette smoke and dim lighting proffered in any given scene, his tall, dark and handsome masculinity contains uncanny elements that are at times mildly suggestive of a young Timothy Dalton, Robert Di Niro, even Kevin Kline. Madison Avenue is reknowned for cynically packaging products or political personalities for retail sale but the consumer's ultimate acceptance is an exercise in free will that is heavily influenced by the cunning efforts of men like Draper. Whether Draper is signed on to promote cigarettes, aerosol deodorant, an upscale department store, presidential candidate or even promoting the state of Israel, he brings a cold and calculating hard edged view of the world to the table. It may be true that the incessant cigarette smoking and hard drinking during regular business hours by almost all of the brilliantly defined characters in ""Mad Men"" is no longer de rigueur, the compulsion towards self-destruction has not changed one whit. No one defines that trait better than gifted actor John Slattery who plays Draper's boss, Roger Sterling. As a partner in the adveristing agency, Sterling is at once a likeable fellow and yet morally repugnant. Slattery pulls off the character effortlessly. The secondary male characters in ""Mad Men"" are well acquainted with feelings of ennui. Many in Drapers's staff for the most part married yet openly pursue self-gratifying liaisons with willing female co-workers with feminine agendas of their own. Some things have not changed one whit in all these years, even as the unadjusted price for a gallon of gas was around 30 cents in 1960 and tops $4.00 a gallon today.  The prices for virtually all commodities may have changed over the years but rest assured, people and their inate capacity to be gulled has not. You'd think we'd know better by now. That is the essential genius and overarching message contained within ""Mad Men."" The successful ad man accepts as an article of faith that the pitch and ultimate message should always contain or vaguely suggest a measure of happiness or bliss associated with the product whether that product be packaged in pill form, a breakfast cereal, an enhancement to health or desirabilty, the only goal is to convince the consumer to open up the pocketbook and buy into the come hither promise of ""new and different.""  Simply put, ""Mad Men"" is brilliantly crafted TV that unabashedly drives that message home.",4,Plop Plop Fizz Fizz,1215216000,"07 5, 2008",2008,3740,"['AMC', 'once', 'again', 'worthy', 'adversary', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'producing', 'quality', 'highly', 'literate', 'television', 'experience', 'Time', 'spent', 'viewing', 'Mad', 'Men', 'not', 'passive', 'couch', 'potato', 'exercise', 'calculated', 'generate', 'momentary', 'knot', 'personal', 'nostalgia', 'experience', 'much', 'more', 'Apartment', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'released', '1960', 'mentioned', 'series', 'very', 'essence', 'big', 'city', 'urban', '1960', 'culture', 'utterly', 'convincingly', 'ways', 'broad', 'subtle', 'look', 'feel', 'time', 'spot', 'what', 'defined', 'Mad', 'Men', 'may', 'shock', 'current', 'PC', 'culture', 'sensibilities', 'relates', 'race', 'gender', 'relations', 'core', 'Mad', 'Men', 'viewer', 'blistering', 'not', 'too', 'flattering', 'look', 'ourselves', 'entrenched', 'culture', 'consumerism', 'strong', 'today', 'was', 'nearly', 'half', 'century', 'ago', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'inspired', 'cast', 'little', 'known', 'actors', 'portraying', 'reticent', 'mysterious', 'Donald', 'Draper', 'highly', 'sought', 'ad', 'man', 'selling', 'genius', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'second', 'billing', 'Peggy', 'Olsen', 'Draper', 'wide-eyed', 'new', 'secretary', 'Moss', 'acting', 'resume', 'stint', 'young', 'Zoey', 'Bartlett', 'daughter', 'President', 'West', 'Wing', 'Hamm', 'would', 'make', 'convincing', 'James', 'Bond', 'depending', 'camera', 'angle', 'ever', 'present', 'obscuring', 'cigarette', 'smoke', 'dim', 'lighting', 'proffered', 'given', 'scene', 'tall', 'dark', 'handsome', 'masculinity', 'uncanny', 'elements', 'are', 'times', 'mildly', 'suggestive', 'young', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Robert', 'Di', 'Niro', 'even', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'reknowned', 'cynically', 'packaging', 'products', 'political', 'personalities', 'retail', 'sale', 'consumer', 'ultimate', 'acceptance', 'exercise', 'free', 'will', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'cunning', 'efforts', 'men', 'Draper', 'Whether', 'Draper', 'signed', 'promote', 'cigarettes', 'aerosol', 'deodorant', 'upscale', 'department', 'store', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'even', 'promoting', 'state', 'Israel', 'cold', 'calculating', 'hard', 'edged', 'view', 'world', 'table', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'incessant', 'cigarette', 'smoking', 'hard', 'drinking', 'regular', 'business', 'hours', 'almost', 'brilliantly', 'defined', 'characters', 'Mad', 'Men', 'longer', 'de', 'rigueur', 'compulsion', 'self-destruction', 'not', 'changed', 'one', 'whit', 'one', 'trait', 'better', 'gifted', 'actor', 'John', 'Slattery', 'who', 'Draper', 'boss', 'Roger', 'Sterling', 'partner', 'adveristing', 'agency', 'Sterling', 'once', 'likeable', 'fellow', 'yet', 'morally', 'repugnant', 'Slattery', 'character', 'effortlessly', 'secondary', 'male', 'characters', 'Mad', 'Men', 'are', 'well', 'acquainted', 'feelings', 'ennui', 'Many', 'Drapers', 'staff', 'most', 'part', 'married', 'yet', 'openly', 'pursue', 'self-gratifying', 'liaisons', 'willing', 'female', 'co-workers', 'feminine', 'agendas', 'own', 'things', 'have', 'not', 'changed', 'one', 'whit', 'years', 'even', 'unadjusted', 'price', 'gallon', 'gas', 'was', 'around', '30', 'cents', '1960', 'tops', '4.00', 'gallon', 'today', 'prices', 'virtually', 'commodities', 'may', 'have', 'changed', 'years', 'rest', 'assured', 'people', 'inate', 'capacity', 'be', 'gulled', 'not', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'know', 'better', 'now', 'essential', 'genius', 'overarching', 'message', 'contained', 'Mad', 'Men', 'successful', 'ad', 'man', 'article', 'faith', 'pitch', 'ultimate', 'message', 'should', 'always', 'contain', 'vaguely', 'suggest', 'measure', 'happiness', 'bliss', 'associated', 'product', 'product', 'be', 'packaged', 'pill', 'form', 'breakfast', 'cereal', 'enhancement', 'health', 'desirabilty', 'only', 'goal', 'convince', 'consumer', 'open', 'up', 'pocketbook', 'buy', 'come', 'promise', 'new', 'different', 'Simply', 'put', 'Mad', 'Men', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'TV', 'unabashedly', 'message', 'home']",Mad Men: Season 1

1117174,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B000YABIQ6,,"[9, 13]","Kevin McDonald's 'The Culture of Critique: an Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements' (1998, 2002) describes how ""Jewish intellectuals initiated and advanced a number of important intellectual movements during the 20th century."" McDonald argues that ""these movements are an attempt to alter Western societies in a manner that would neutralize or end anti-Semitism and enhance the prospects for Jewish group continuity either in overt or in a semi-cryptic manner. Several of these Jewish movements (e.g., the shift in immigration policy favoring non-European peoples) have attempted to weaken the power of their perceived competitors--the European peoples who early in the 20 century had assumed a dominant position not only in their traditional homelands in Europe, but also in the United States, Canada, and Australia...Ultimately, the movements are viewed as an expression of a group evolutionary strategy by Jews in their competition for social, political, and cultural dominance with non-Jews.""AMC's 'Mad Men' Season One (2007) and its subsequent seasons are of such exceptional quality that the program practically sets a new standard for television excellence--a very surprising thing to find on American television, whether network or cable, in 2010.Creator, writer, and director Matthew Weiner's 'Mad Men' is about many things, but it is primarily about the end of an era in American history, an era seen by many as one of America's 'Golden Ages,' and one which was culturally, socially, and financially dominated by White Anglo-Saxon Protestants--WASPs.WASPs dominate 'Mad Men,' and while the program is superficially sympathetic to its WASP characters some of the time, the viewer can't help notice how married advertising executive Don Draper's Jewish mistress, department store owner Rachel Menken, eventually makes the 'right' choice of rejecting Draper and wedding a respectable Jewish man. Elsewhere in the show, the Jewish men and women that infrequently flit across the screen (potential clients representing the State of Israel's tourism bureau, etc.) are depicted in  largely agreeable, if stoic, terms.Beneath its always intelligent, amber-hued surface, 'Man Men' is certainly a hard, even an ugly, critique of High WASP culture: though the Drapers and most of the other characters are educated, socially prominent, poised, witty, attractive, and talented, they are also routinely adulterous, alcoholic, and believe women are capable of being little more than sex objects, housewives, or over-the-hill matrons worth deceiving until divorcing.The show's subtitle, in fact, could accurately be ""Oh, Those AWFUL White People.""One account executive is so drunk in the midday office that when he urinates in his trousers, the accident has to be pointed out to him by coworkers. Another character allows his eight year-old granddaughter to drive an automobile through the Hudson River Valley's suburban streets. Ad agency partner Roger Sterling enthusiastically performs Stephen Foster songs in blackface at his palatial Long Island estate, sexually propositions Don's wife the moment Don steps out of the room, and unquestioningly assumes that the models used in agency campaigns will have sexual intercourse with him.A handsome young doctor rapes his newlywed wife on the floor of her office; one presumably loopy secretary runs over and amputates her boss's foot with a riding mower at an office party.The ad executives smoke marijuana and consort with drug dealers, have their secretaries sit on their laps while doing their typing, and steal mail not addressed to them. Account Executive Peter Campbell attempts to blackmail Draper to force a promotion. A comedian, who has everything to lose and nothing to gain in his action, insults the overweight wife of his sponsor. The Sterling Cooper staff believe Nixon is a natural to win the presidency over Kennedy.During a casual business meeting, two of the male staff mock the 'awful aprons' worn by the WASP star of 'The Loretta Young Show Show,' and even the fabric pattern on the same program's sofa, but Jewish Bob Dylan is praised during the same discussion.When Don's beautiful wife, Betty, pushes her adulterous spouse in an explosion of frustration, Don shoves her back with at least equal force. When the Draper family enjoys a picnic on a pristine Hudson River Valley hillside, they blithely leave a small mountain of garbage behind them; Don casually throws his beer bottles in the bushes.Don fires his male art director for refusing the sexual advances of an important client, also male. When Don discovers one of his mistresses has been discussing him with her friends, he forces her arms behind her, ties her to the bed--and leaves her there. Don rejects his younger sibling, Adam, so completely that Adam hangs himself in despair.And most tellingly, handsome, dapper, capable Don Draper is not the educated gentleman of the upper class he pretends to be; he's the illegitimate son of a prostitute who died in childbirth, and who was then abusively raised by 'backward' Pennsylvania farmers.Don is an unconscious misogynist, a compulsive liar, a philanderer, a drunken driver, a sociopath, and a complete fake in almost every sense. His true background is in used cars and furs. Don is false. Though typically presented in the show's deceptively glamorous light, Don is one of Elliot's 'Hollow Men,' empty and stuffed with figurative, existential straw.All of these incidents and characterizations might be expected and wholly acceptable if 'Mad Men' was a typical American soap opera, whether a tradtional daytime melodrama like 'As the World Turns' or a slice of 1980s primetime kitsch like 'Dynasty.'But 'Mad Men' is not a soap opera; 'Mad Men' is a 'serious' drama aspiring to be 'serious' 'art' of a kind (though 'The Jet Set' episode in Season Two, in which Don is taken up by an international set of wealthy vagabonds in California, probably the worst-written of any episode in the first four seasons, veers hilariously towards outright soap opera camp).Much of program is rooted in 'hard' fact (Don Draper is based around legendary ad man Draper Daniels, for example), and appears to accurately reflect history; however, it is WASPs, and by extension, all Europeans of Anglo-Saxon descent who come in for Weiner's and his fellow writers' continuous spleen (copy writer Peggy Olson, for instance, is Catholic and from a lower middle class Brooklyn background). Black and Hispanic characters are few and relegated far to the sidelines.Though the show is thought-provoking, entertaining, and often brilliantly written and produced, the excessive critique of Western European-American culture is unfair to its subject, insofar as Jews, Blacks, and Hispanics are almost completely exempted from the same criticism. When Jewish, Black or Hispanic characters do appear, they are presented as either victims of WASP culture or shrewd individuals who use their intelligence to avoid both victimization and personal moral and ethical failing.Viewers will be hard-pressed to imagine a program with a similar show of teeth being made by Protestants about Jews; the outcry against it would be tremendous, and cries of anti-Semitism would flood the media landscape.'Mad Men' is simply another in a series of 'blows against the empire' WASP America has suffered since the 1960s. It succeeds in its own way because, thanks to the forces aggressively united against WASP America for four decades, many of which are now a dominant presence the media, today almost everyone is quite familiar with the narrative 'Mad Men' is selling: ""We all know that that is how White people are, and certainly were then.""Watch and enjoy 'Mad Men'; but by all means watch it critically, as it deserves to be watched, and do not overlook what the show fairly celebrates: the Fall of the American Anglo, which the opening credits dramatize quite literally.",3,"WASPs Repellant (Or, ""Oh!

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[6, 6]","Ah the cigarettes, the sexism, the smarmy executives, the docile secretaries, the bored housewives ... welcome to America in 1960 and specifically Madison Ave where this engrossing series is set.We are in the macho world of advertising execs on a quest to sell the perfect product while drinking and screwing their way to perdition. Much of the fun is seeing how much things have changed. Did people really smoke that much? I felt as if I was getting lung cancer just from watching them. They light up first thing in the morning, before meals, after meals, during sex, on the train, in the car, in the kitchen, in the toilet, in the office. The whole world musty have smelled of smoke. That lovely, blond, Grace Kelly look alike with the peaches and cream comlexion must have given off the odor of an ashtray.Were people really so sexist? Women, or rather girls, are treated totally like objects -- of desire, or more accurately of lust, of ridicule, of disdain, of pity, of scorn -- never ever as equals.The main character, Donald Draper, is a handsome, suave  and talented adman with a wife, two kids, a couple of mistresses and a secret. His secretary, Peggy Olson in an ingenue on the way up. Various other sleazy types inhabit the office. We also see Draper's home life, his lovely but bored wife Betty and the kids.There's a lot of pleasure to be had from spotting the period references. The reconstruction of the early sixties milieu seems to be flawless. Wonderful artifacts of the period, half-forgotten, seem to pop up at every moment. But of course, we're not really in 1960 -- we're looking back at ourselves not so long ago and wondering at how far we've come -- and how far we still have to go.This is a great series.",5,Entertaining trip back to a different era,1263945600,"01 20, 2010",2010,1731,"['cigarettes', 'sexism', 'smarmy', 'executives', 'docile', 'secretaries', 'bored', 'housewives', 'welcome', 'America', '1960', 'specifically', 'Madison', 'Ave', 'where', 'engrossing', 'series', 'set.We', 'are', 'macho', 'world', 'advertising', 'execs', 'quest', 'sell', 'perfect', 'product', 'drinking', 'screwing', 'way', 'perdition', 'Much', 'fun', 'seeing', 'how', 'much', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'Did', 'people', 'really', 'smoke', 'much', 'felt', 'was', 'getting', 'lung', 'cancer', 'just', 'watching', 'light', 'up', 'first', 'thing', 'morning', 'meals', 'meals', 'sex', 'train', 'car', 'kitchen', 'toilet', 'office', 'whole', 'world', 'musty', 'have', 'smelled', 'smoke', 'lovely', 'blond', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'look', 'alike', 'peaches', 'cream', 'comlexion', 'must', 'have', 'given', 'off', 'odor', 'ashtray.Were', 'people', 'really', 'so', 'sexist', 'Women', 'rather', 'girls', 'are', 'treated', 'totally', 'like', 'objects', 'desire', 'more', 'accurately', 'lust', 'ridicule', 'disdain', 'pity', 'scorn', 'never', 'ever', 'equals.The', 'main', 'character', 'Donald', 'Draper', 'handsome', 'suave', 'talented', 'adman', 'wife', 'two', 'kids', 'couple', 'mistresses', 'secret', 'secretary', 'Peggy', 'Olson', 'ingenue', 'way', 'up', 'Various', 'other', 'sleazy', 'types', 'inhabit', 'office', 'also', 'see', 'Draper', 'home', 'life', 'lovely', 'bored', 'wife', 'Betty', 'kids.There', 'lot', 'pleasure', 'be', 'had', 'spotting', 'period', 'references', 'reconstruction', 'early', 'sixties', 'milieu', 'be', 'flawless', 'Wonderful', 'artifacts', 'period', 'half-forgotten', 'seem', 'pop', 'up', 'moment', 'course', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', '1960', ""'re"", 'looking', 'back', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'wondering', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'how', 'far', 'still', 'have', 'go.This', 'great', 'series']",Mad Men: Season 1

I can only add my personal reactions. I have been avoiding it for several seasons, since I found the relation between men and women quite disturbing, in spite of the fact that I lived through that early '60s era, but in a somewhat lower class family, where my mother worked in a factory and my father in the steel mills. I was also a bit turned off by the time spend in the bedroom rather than the board room. I loved ""The West Wing"" because, among other things, it demonstrated how power was far more exciting than sex, and I thought that the new series ""Suits"" did the same thing. But, after seeing none of my USA, TNT, and TBS series win any awards, and the AMC series raking them in like Hershey Kisses, I thought it was time to give this a try. A nudge from my Facebook friend Esther Schindler didn't hurt.So, I have discovered that the pace, the dialoge, the characters, and the situations, all framed with superior writing and good acting, really draws me into this world, in spite of its air of testosterone out of control, where the only thing the men want to do with all the women they meet is to get them into the sack. That's an exaggeration, of course, but it happens far more than most other series this side of Californication.If I had any complaints, it would be that there are very few really satisfying conclusions to the story arcs. One gets the feeling that the big climax will come with the series finale, similar to Josh Lyman and Donna Moss finally hooking up in the next to last episode of ""The West Wing."" Closing deals with clients just doesn't give me a great deal of satisfaction. There are personal crises, but everything is so low key, one is reminded of how empty people's lives seemed to be before the great cultural revolution of 1964. On the bright side, I am positively looking forward to watching the next season to see how things work out.It's interesting to compare John Hamm with Gabriel Macht of ""Suits"". Both characters are eminantly skilled at their jobs, and comfortable in their own skins. But ""Mad Men's"" Don Draper is understated while ""Suits"" Harvey Specter is arrogant and just a bit blind to his weaknesses.",5,"Excellent plot, characters, dialogue...Good Writing.",1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,2262,"['How', 'can', 'hope', 'say', 'anything', 'not', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'AMC', 'series', '450', 'reviews', 'can', 'only', 'add', 'personal', 'reactions', 'have', 'been', 'avoiding', 'several', 'seasons', 'found', 'relation', 'men', 'women', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'spite', 'fact', 'lived', 'early', ""'60s"", 'era', 'somewhat', 'lower', 'class', 'family', 'where', 'mother', 'worked', 'factory', 'father', 'steel', 'mills', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'turned', 'off', 'time', 'spend', 'bedroom', 'rather', 'board', 'room', 'loved', 'West', 'Wing', 'other', 'things', 'demonstrated', 'how', 'power', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'exciting', 'sex', 'thought', 'new', 'series', 'Suits', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'seeing', 'none', 'USA', 'TNT', 'TBS', 'series', 'win', 'awards', 'AMC', 'series', 'raking', 'Hershey', 'Kisses', 'thought', 'was', 'time', 'give', 'try', 'nudge', 'Facebook', 'friend', 'Esther', 'Schindler', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt.So', 'have', 'discovered', 'pace', 'dialoge', 'characters', 'situations', 'framed', 'superior', 'writing', 'good', 'acting', 'really', 'draws', 'world', 'spite', 'air', 'testosterone', 'control', 'where', 'only', 'thing', 'men', 'want', 'do', 'women', 'meet', 'get', 'sack', 'exaggeration', 'course', 'far', 'more', 'most', 'other', 'series', 'side', 'Californication.If', 'had', 'complaints', 'would', 'be', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'really', 'satisfying', 'conclusions', 'story', 'arcs', 'One', 'feeling', 'big', 'climax', 'will', 'come', 'series', 'finale', 'similar', 'Josh', 'Lyman', 'Donna', 'Moss', 'finally', 'hooking', 'up', 'next', 'last', 'episode', 'West', 'Wing', 'Closing', 'deals', 'clients', 'just', ""n't"", 'give', 'great', 'deal', 'satisfaction', 'are', 'personal', 'crises', 'everything', 'so', 'low', 'key', 'one', 'reminded', 'how', 'empty', 'people', 'lives', 'seemed', 'be', 'great', 'cultural', 'revolution', '1964', 'bright', 'side', 'am', 'positively', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'next', 'season', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'interesting', 'compare', 'John', 'Hamm', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'Suits', 'characters', 'are', 'eminantly', 'skilled', 'jobs', 'comfortable', 'own', 'skins', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Don', 'Draper', 'understated', 'Suits', 'Harvey', 'Specter', 'arrogant', 'just', 'bit', 'blind', 'weaknesses']",Mad Men: Season 1

After watching the first episode of Mad Men, Season One -- I think it's confirmed.  Drinking in the office from 9am on?  People smoking indoors with no regard for common decency?  Sexually harassing one's secretary, and it just being considered commonplace to cheat on one's wife?  Don Draper doesn't bat an eyelash at these things, and moves through life as if a psychopath only concerned with his own well-being.  I also liked how his wife didn't ask any questions when he told her that he decided to &#34;Stay in the city&#34; the last couple nights, without even so much as a phone call.  There is zero expectation that he will contribute to caring for his child also.  Needless to say if I attempted any of these things, my wife would have me drawn and quartered.

1117180,A4WEZJOIZIV4U,B000YABIQ6,"Chuck Bittner ""Disabled comedian & gamer!""","[3, 3]",I wanted to just put this up here not as a review of the show because Mad Men it is awesome and if you're looking at this you probably are you know that. But please if you're new to the show listen to this warning.you must watch this show would order to get the most out of every episode. Most television shows I feel you can skip some episodes and still derive a great quantity of joy from subsequent episodes but madmen stands apart. It is a show that I think in such a masterful way build on each previous episode. And if you miss an episode you're going to miss the reasons why certain characters act the way they do talk the way they do and do the things that they do.for example I missed season two finale the carousel and went on to season three and I was like what the heck is going on I didn't realize it until I finished all of season three and was like something was off the whole season seemed a little bit tweaked as they were building on things that I had missed ( it is of note that the carousel was the one of the most amazing season finales that a person could miss but somehow I pulled that off I can be a bonehead sometimes)For instance Roger Sterling  has so much back story and is not even a real major player in the show but if you miss some episodes you missed the buildup to his character.  Don Draper is a Shining example of someone that is touched upon and built upon in every episode.so that is my warning watch every episode of madmen from start to finish in order.I'm Chuck Bittner from AskACapper dot com And I approve of this message!PS watching madmen in high definition is a must that's why recommend only watching it that way.

1117181,A1BIL65NSE1UX6,B000YABIQ6,clarita apple,"[3, 3]","Mad Men is an absolute masterpiece. I agree 200% with all the rave reviews here.I'm not going to add to the ample reviews of this show. Instead, I would like to comment on the generous extras included in the DVD set.I debated a long time before buying the DVDs since I own the season on iTunes. I'm glad I bought the DVDs -- the commentaries and extras make it worth every penny.Each episode has at least one commentary track, usually two separate commentary tracks. And there are other extras - a 20-minute piece, ""Advertising the American Dream"", a 10-minute video on scoring Mad Men, and the hour-long 'Establishing Mad Men'--all excellent.A word about the commentaries -- the ones by creator and writer Matt Weiner are superb, very insightful and interesting. I haven't listened to all the other commentaries yet. Of the ones I have listened to, Weiner's are definitely the best, Vincent Kartheiser, January Jones, and Jon Hamm also provide interesting depth. The brilliant costume designer Janie Bryant also provides wonderful commentary.I wish some of the other commentaries had been edited, though. For instance, in Jon Hamm's, January Jones', and Elizabeth Moss' commentary on the last episode, 'The Wheel', Elizabeth Moss' comments on the padding used to show her weight gain. This is an interesting aside, but Moss' commentary goes on far too long and it's all trivial, with no insights into Peggy's character.

After it had been running a while, I heard it was very good, so tried out an episode from season one and got interested.I've now seen all of season one and REALLY liked it.As I told a friend of mine when recommending it. This tells the story of the era where we come from. I was born in 1960 which is the year of season one.Shall we say times have a changed a LOT since then. It is hard to imagine that things were as depicted, but they probably were - well, I suspect they exaggerate maybe a tad, but maybe not. Politically correct it is not.One thing is all the smoking. I mean, it is constant. And the drinking. And ""bad"" behavior.People think we live in a more enlightened time now and maybe we do, but still watching this show, I cannot help but feel that we lost something we need to find again in the process.If you can't remember the early 1960's, take a look. It does seem to be true to life setting wise. They did an incredible job there.Briefly, the show centers around a guy working in an ad agency in New York starting in 1960. He has a mysterious past which is explained late in the first season. He is a likable guy, but he has some big flaws - at least as we see things now anyway.

Watched a few episodes every week. First off, be prepared for a look at 1960 that is very reflexive, meaning it distills the worst of the era into bits so repetitive that it becomes annoying. Everyone smokes in every scene (almost). Same for the drinking. Same for the racism, misogyny, and other characteristics. Certainly these evils existed, but to hit them with a sledgehammer every time distracts from the storyline. That said, there are many redeeming qualities of this show. Don Draper is an ad exec facing his own demons and an upstart exec. Don's wife and her girlfriends live in the homemaker life, casting a wary eye on a divorce neighbor. And the plot spins on from there: big money at stake, promotions, personal relationships, betrayal and more. I look forward to following the next season to see where this goes and will post another review for Season 2 separately.

1117184,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B000YABIQ6,DarthRad,"[11, 15]","Wow, this series just took my breath away. It is a deeply thoughtful re-creation of America in 1960, as seen through the lives of the people at a fictional ad agency in New York City. This is a period of time that has rarely been explored in modern cinema.I was a small child in the 1960s, but I still have vivid memories of that time.  America in 1960 was right at the cusp of sweeping social change. In 1964, LBJ passed the landmark Civil Rights Act; in 1965 he escalated the war in Vietnam.  In 1968, assassinations, riots, the Tet offensive, the sexual revolution, the rise of youth power (from what later became known as the baby boomers), and the election of Richard Nixon as President would start a long period that would  completely re-make American society.We are indeed a much different society today than in 1960, but the true genius of ""Mad Men"" is that there is a much deeper layer to the way the series underscores the differences between then and now.I remember the sharply defined gender roles, the men going to work wearing formal suits and ties, the women and their pointy bras, the incessant cigarette smoking (I hated cigarette smoke then and still do), the frequent presence of hard liquor (the style of new American houses of that era included built-in mini-bars for hard liquor and mixed drinks), and the casual racism (I remember seeing a ""whites only"" public drinking fountain for the first time as a child, and asking my mother what that was all about). Homosexuality was something almost unheard of, and definitely not discussed in polite company. Government sponsored warnings were about marijuana and unbecoming dating habits, not about cigarettes, alcohol, or the dangers of large plastic bags.All of these aspects of 1960s culture are strikingly featured in ""Mad Men"".The characters in ""Mad Men"" move about in realistic 1960s fashion - all men smoked back then, because they picked up the habit while in the armed forces, which gave out cigarettes in the ration packs. Married men screwed around regularly in secret, illegitimate children were conveniently packed off for adoption (as a child, in school, it was common to find schoolmates who were adopted), and the wives kept silent and divorces were far fewer than they are now. A gay character in the series has an encounter but has to closet his feelings.We think we are so much smarter and better now than we were in 1960. In this time of Barack Obama, we are talking about a post-racist American society. We have sex education, we have birth control, we have legalized abortion, we have Mothers Against Drunk Driving and police sobriety checkpoints (Roger Sterling would surely have lost his driver's license in today's world), and in case that fails, we have air bags inside the cars. We have smoke-free airplanes, homes, restaurants, hospitals, etc. Smokers are treated like lepers (yea!). Women are empowered, we have Title IX, we have mandatory sexual harassment training in the corporate workplace, we have community property for marriages.But are we really so much better off today than we were in 1960? By some health standards we are. Average life spans have increased. Traffic fatalities per mile driven were far, far higher back then than they are now. Men used to just keel over and die from a ""coronary"" when only in their 50's and 60's. That rarely happens anymore.Racism has in fact not gone away, only changed in the details. Poor African-Americans in the cities have gone from being openly repressed to being incarcerated. And even though Hollywood now has black actors in every single movie or TV show (one suspects a quota system), many other minorities are still underrepresented. Muslims and Arabs are now the Negroes of the entertainment industry, portrayed only in stereotypical blackface.And as unrealistic as the ideal nuclear family in 1960 may seem to us now, it was very real for the children of that time. I do remember that children were much better off then. We children played freely in the streets and backyards without parental supervision. Children usually had two parents, not one. Most children had stay-at-home moms. Parents had definite roles, parents were around, parents did not just break up and disappear as they do so often now.Today, divorces have skyrocketed, we have children completely unmonitored by either parent because both are working or absent, and the large numbers of children born out of wedlock are no longer given up for adoption to families able to take care of them. Instead it has become the norm for single mothers to try to raise children themselves, often with terrible results for both mother and child. The numbers are huge. One out of three children are now born out of wedlock, two out of three in the African-American community. Women, having become empowered in the workplace, did not at the same time also gain the super powers needed to raise children alone; many men certainly saw this empowerment thing as an opportunity to skip out on their responsibilities as fathers.Even cigarette and alcohol abuse have not been tamed so much as replaced by the worse problems of marijuana and cocaine.The year 1960 was a special and yet transient moment in time for American society, the last moments of a pre-pubescent America, still the nave superpower of the post-WWII era, before it began the long, agonizing transformation into the confused, liberated, legalistic, and moralistic America of today.  This was a young, earnest, idealistic America that was on top of the world, one that thought it could do no wrong, thought it had the answers for everything.And so finally, at the end of this brilliant first season DVD of ""Mad Men"", when we look deeper into what it really tells us, we see that what it says is, my goodness, how we have changed!  But have we changed all that much for the better?",5,A brilliant and evocative re-creation of America at childhood's end,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,5850,"['Wow', 'series', 'just', 'took', 'breath',

Perkins ""wide reader""","[1, 1]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThe first season of ""Mad Men,"" American Movie Classics' original flagship drama, beautifully lays out the involved dramatic satire in its thirteen episodes.  Featuring one of the most versatile ensemble casts on television, the show is remarkable for providing genuine entertainment while also providing very thoughtful material for the intellect.Centering on the fictitious ad agency Sterling Cooper and its charmingly egotistical top creative mind Don Draper(Jon Hamm in an iconic performance), the show satirizes the image of clean early 1960's America by highlighting masculine sexual dominance in the office and strongly patriarchal gender roles in the home.  A fairly sharp postmodern repudiation of that era of American culture, the show is incisive in having little or no ties to modern America.  Instead, the actions of a character can make an in-the-moment critique of a given stuation, and it imbues the show with a sense of timelessness.Character development drives the show, whether in the workplace or in the Draper household.  Robert Morse is excellent as Bert Cooper, a slightly gentler counterpoint to John Slattery's loutish Roger Sterling.  Vincent Kartheiser makes an indelible impression as ruthless young business shark Peter Campbell, and Elisabeth Moss is perfect as Peggy Olson, a sharp young secretary who wants more for herself.  Also noteworthy in the cast is a pitch-perfect January Jones as Betty Draper.The Blu-Ray picture and sound is extremely sharp.

1117192,A106016KSI0YQ,B000YABIQ6,Jay Dickson,"[247, 257]","It would be hard to imagine a more absorbingly intelligent American TV series--in terms of writing, acting, and visuals--than MAD MEN. Just before the final season of THE SOPRANOS began in late 2007, AMC presented us in the summer with the thirteen episodes of this marvelously atmospheric series created by one of the main writers of the series, Matt Weiner, that HBO insanely took a pass on. Ostensibly the series is about a group of advertising agency working for Madison Avenue advertising agency, the fictitious Sterling-Cooper, in 1960, during the Nixon-Kennedy presidential contest; yet on a deeper level the show wrestles with much larger questions about the meaning of obsession with having (and marketing) happiness in mid-20th-century America. The series centers primarily around four characters whose lives are inextricably linked with one another: Don Draper (Jon Hamm), a handsome advertising executive at Sterling-Cooper of few words but enormous creative gifts who hides a mysterious past; his beautiful but childlike wife Betty (January Jones), whom he keeps entirely separate in the suburbs from his work life and his mistresses in the city; Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss), Don's new secretary, whose naive affect and kind heart belie her tremendous ambition; and Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), the smarmy account executive who trades on his ties to the Old New York ""Knickerbocracy"" to get him ahead. The four central actors are absolutely first-rate, as are several within their near orbits: John Slattery as Roger Sterling, the roguish partner who is both Don's friend and his competitor; the gifted Christina Hendricks, as the firm's femme fatale head secretary; and Robert Morse, as the firm's wily and eccentric senior partner.Morse's presence ties the series to his famous work in both the Broadway and Hollywood production of HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING, and the episodes make intelligent reference also to any number of important American fictional works about the NYC business and suburban domestic worlds of the post-War era, including THE APARTMENT and THE BEST OF EVERYTHING. (Richard Yates's REVOLUTIONARY ROAD and the films of Douglas Sirk are also repeatedly evoked too, if in less direct ways.) One of the pleasures of this fine DVD set are the superb extras which allow us to see the especially thoughtful work done by the series' set designers, hairstylists, and (particularly) its head costume designer. The commentaries are generally excellent, and it will come as no surprise to fans of the series that not only the series creator, Matt Weiner, and its writers are especially eloquent but so too are its actors, especially Hamm and Kartheiser. The eye-catching design of this DVD package (fashioned to look and open, naturally, like a classic American manufacturer's product: a Zippo lighter) has been rightly praised for its innovation but also rightly criticized for its unwieldiness.",5,The Pursuit of Happiness,1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,2950,"['would', 'be', 'hard', 'imagine', 'more', 'absorbingly', 'intelligent', 'American', 'TV', 'series', 'terms', 'writing', 'acting', 'visuals', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'Just', 'final', 'season', 'THE', 'SOPRANOS', 'began', 'late', '2007', 'AMC', 'presented', 'summer', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'marvelously', 'atmospheric', 'series', 'created', 'one', 'main', 'writers', 'series', 'Matt', 'Weiner', 'HBO', 'insanely', 'took', 'pass', 'Ostensibly', 'series', 'group', 'advertising', 'agency', 'working', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'advertising', 'agency', 'fictitious', 'Sterling-Cooper', '1960', 'Nixon-Kennedy', 'presidential', 'contest', 'yet', 'deeper', 'level', 'show', 'much', 'larger', 'questions', 'meaning', 'obsession', 'having', 'marketing', 'happiness', 'mid-20th-century', 'America', 'series', 'centers', 'primarily', 'four', 'characters', 'lives', 'are', 'inextricably', 'linked', 'one', 'Don', 'Draper', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'handsome', 'advertising', 'executive', 'Sterling-Cooper', 'few', 'words', 'enormous', 'creative', 'gifts', 'who', 'hides', 'mysterious', 'past', 'beautiful', 'childlike', 'wife', 'Betty', 'January', 'Jones', 'whom', 'entirely', 'separate', 'suburbs', 'work', 'life', 'mistresses', 'city', 'Peggy', 'Olson', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'Don', 'new', 'secretary', 'naive', 'affect', 'kind', 'heart', 'tremendous', 'ambition', 'Pete', 'Campbell', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'smarmy', 'account', 'executive', 'who', 'ties', 'Old', 'New', 'York', 'Knickerbocracy', 'get', 'ahead', 'four', 'central', 'actors', 'are', 'absolutely', 'first-rate', 'are', 'several', 'near', 'orbits', 'John', 'Slattery', 'Roger', 'Sterling', 'roguish', 'partner', 'who', 'Don', 'friend', 'competitor', 'gifted', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'firm', 'femme', 'fatale', 'head', 'secretary', 'Robert', 'Morse', 'firm', 'wily', 'eccentric', 'senior', 'partner.Morse', 'presence', 'series', 'famous', 'work', 'Broadway', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'HOW', 'TO', 'SUCCEED', 'IN', 'BUSINESS', 'WITHOUT', 'REALLY', 'TRYING', 'episodes', 'make', 'intelligent', 'reference', 'also', 'number', 'important', 'American', 'fictional', 'works', 'NYC', 'business', 'suburban', 'domestic', 'worlds', 'post-War', 'era', 'including', 'THE', 'APARTMENT', 'THE', 'BEST', 'EVERYTHING', 'Richard', 'Yates', 'REVOLUTIONARY', 'ROAD', 'films', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'are', 'also', 'repeatedly', 'evoked', 'too', 'less', 'direct', 'ways', 'One', 'pleasures', 'fine', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'superb', 'extras', 'allow', 'see', 'especially', 'thoughtful', 'work', 'done', 'series', 'set', 'designers', 'hairstylists', 'particularly', 'head', 'costume', 'designer', 'commentaries', 'are', 'generally', 'excellent', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'fans', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'series', 'creator', 'Matt', 'Weiner', 'writers', 'are', 'especially', 'eloquent', 'so', 'too', 'are', 'actors', 'especially', 'Hamm', 'Kartheiser', 'eye-catching', 'design', 'DVD', 'package', 'fashioned', 'look', 'open', 'naturally', 'classic', 'American', 'manufacturer', 'product', 'Zippo', 'lighter', 'been', 'rightly', 'praised', 'innovation', 'also', 'rightly', 'criticized', 'unwieldiness']",Mad Men: Season 1

There is great joy in celebrating the era which is shown in the wonderful attention to detail.

If you grew up in that era you will be constantly be entertained by the period detail and the take on the rise of the American corporate beast. This is the Industrial Military Complex defined. If you are younger and seeing it for the first time you should not discount the hedonism, greed and avarice that permeates every episode. They were and still are the defining characteristics of the post WW II American evolution. It's also what built the powerful economy that now is in tatters. The same types of men doing the same types of jobs you see in Mad Men now worry about how fast they can get out of the American market.

Swanson,"[4, 5]","4.29 stars(And recommended by four out of five dentists)There are definitely moments of real glory here, mainly from Hamm, who really brings home the bacon. He sells the sizzle and the steak as well. The rest of the cast is quite fine but he carries this puppy and does a very good job, showing far more depth than is common in tv acting.Nonetheless, this show has Six Feet Under-itis: it comes out of the gate at a full gallop in the pilot and then slowly loses steam, until by the end of the first season it's still a fine show but has lost the magic of its early moments. It looks technicolor-lush and 50s/60s surreal throughout, though, to its great credit. Big props to the art designers on MadMen; it's as slick as its subject.Matt Weiner writes some gorgeous lines (""He'd rather be a whiner than a weener?"" said the missus when he said his name on the commentary), and there are occasional moments of extreme lucidity regarding the America dream. For that alone this series deserves serious praise. That it slowly floats into soap opera-ish territory is unfortunate but mildly inevitable; series that start this strong and never fade are few indeed.But those first few shows are tremendous, and this is in general many cuts above the norm; I'll take whatever knowing irony I can get these days, as the oblivious irony is endemic.

I managed to go this long without watching a single episode or learning a single thing about any of its characters or events. I had, of course, heard of the rave reviews, but the concept (the lives and times of advertising executives in Manhattan) didn't really interest me. Also, I'm generally of the sort that if something has massively wide appeal (see: Twilight), then I'm probably not going to like it. I'm not an elitist; I just find that wildly popular entertainment has usually been dumbed down to have broader draw.At the insistence of friends and family, I finally sat down to watch the first season of this much-lauded show, and -- I won't lie -- I immediately hated it. The characters are pretty much all despicable. The men are obnoxious adulterers. The women are either hollow, petulant shells or obvious caricatures of sexuality for the men to gape and paw at. Right off the bat, the central character -- a charismatic and mysterious advertising executive named Don Draper -- falls madly in love with a rich Jewess he has just met. ""What the?"" I said. ""Has he met her before?"" By the third episode, I was ready to call it quits.I'm so glad I didn't.It is easy to get tied up in concepts like story and entertainment, but it is so rare to find subtlety, depth, and brilliance in primetime television that I have often stopped looking for them. The more I watched this show, though, the more I realized that there was a true craft at work. Not only is every element ingeniously placed and crafted -- from the soundtrack, costumes, backdrops, asides, cultural references, and glances -- but it is done so in such a way that, even if you aren't aware of them, you can't help but appreciate them. What a joy to finally find a work of art -- and, yes, this show is certainly a work of art -- that actively finagles its way into your braincells. You can focus on superficialities such as whose doing what (or whom) and where the plot is headed, but you will soon find yourself (if even subconsciously) noting how perfectly those larger elements mesh with the show's less overt environment.I was initially distracted by the truly selfish, lazy, and loathsome attitudes of the show's main characters, but I see now that they are representations of American culture as it was, wants to be, and even is today. The show's themes -- success, happiness, love, hope, and commercialism -- are never pounded into the scripts or set pieces, and yet they are so achingly resonant that I ended each episode with a tingle in my neck and an immediate desire to watch it again. It is nearly impossible to watch one without feeling as if there were parts -- important or not -- that slipped your notice or that you would love to go back and fully learn how to relish. Everything from the acting, dialogue, and subject matter ties together in a way that, well, that I don't know if I've ever seen on TV before.Watch it.

Absurd!Most all of the major characters are non-sympathetic, so that you're not rooting for anyone, they're all bad (or vapid) people.  The Pete Campbell character I can hardly stand to look at.  Only a few peripheral characters seem to be relatively decent.I realize normal people don't make complelling television, but it's a too cynical view of the business world; you've got to have some balance.

We never even came across it by accident turning channels over the past 3 years.But the people working on this show deserve great praise for bringing the early 1960s alive !!Sometimes you forget you are watching a recreation of the 60s and feel like you are really watching something from that era.Much of the show's initial charm rests in it's nostalgic recreation of the culture of the era ........ we can also get a chuckle by seeing products featured on the show we remember from our younger days.The only small critique I may make is the storylines sometime move at such a slow and agonizing pace it gets a little boring.Despite the praise above, I must confess after 2 seasons, we have lost all interest in the show.I suppose it cant' be helped being a time period drama, but it started to feels like nothing more than a daytime Soap Opera but set in the 60s.Maybe the unique novelty of being so authentically set in the 60s made it feel special for 2 Seasons ....... but now it just plods along like an episode of ""As The World Turns"".So we went from LOVING the show to not caring to watch the remaining episodes or the current new season on AMC.",3,Very Impressive Effort to Bring 1960s Alive,1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,1494,"['will', 'keep', 'short', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'made', 'excellent', 'comments', 'series', 'thus', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'repeating', 'words.We', 'never', 'saw', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'TV', 'only', 'just', 'now', 'rented', 'first', 'season', 'DVD.Oddly', 'was', 'one', 'new', 'shows', 'saw', 'advertised', 'once', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'never', 'heard', 'saw', 'anything', 'more', 'never', 'even', 'came', 'accident', 'turning', 'channels', 'past', '3', 'people', 'working', 'show', 'great', 'praise', 'bringing', 'early', '1960s', 'alive', 'Sometimes', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'recreation', '60s', 'feel', 'are', 'really', 'watching', 'something', 'era.Much', 'show', 'initial', 'charm', 'rests', 'nostalgic', 'recreation', 'culture', 'era', 'can', 'also', 'get', 'chuckle', 'seeing', 'products', 'featured', 'show', 'remember', 'younger', 'days.The', 'only', 'small', 'critique', 'may', 'make', 'storylines', 'sometime', 'move', 'slow', 'agonizing', 'pace', 'little', 'boring.Despite', 'praise', 'must', 'confess', '2', 'seasons', 'have', 'lost', 'interest', 'show.I', 'suppose', 'cant', 'be', 'helped', 'being', 'time', 'period', 'drama', 'started', 'feels', 'nothing', 'more', 'daytime', 'Soap', 'Opera', 'set', '60s.Maybe', 'unique', 'novelty', 'being', 'so', 'authentically', 'set', '60s', 'made', 'feel', 'special', '2', 'Seasons', 'now', 'just', 'plods', 'episode', 'World', 'Turns', '.So', 'went', 'LOVING', 'show', 'not', 'caring', 'watch', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'current', 'new', 'season', 'AMC']",Mad Men: Season 1

As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so for 5 seasons now.Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on the real life ad men Draper Daniels and Rosser Reeves). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He is a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He has it all. And yet he cannot find peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away.From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones as Don's wife), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the 50's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes season 1. There are four more. Season 6 is eminent whereas season 7 has already been green-lighted. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes.

1117208,A3DYIGOLWS5CNS,B000YABIQ6,Niel Rishoi,"[154, 176]","The summer of 2007 is when Mad Men swept the nation. Why? It is anti-politically correct. It is an intelligent, thinking man's (""persons"" would be too PC for *this* show)) show for adults. Not to mention the fantastic, Rod Serling-esque realism in the quality of its writing, the direction, the scope, and the dazzling work of the previously unknown cast - now all certified household names - stars, if you will (none will ever have to worry about getting future work).  The best part of this casting is that there are no familiar public-entrenched ""personalities"" to disturb the continuity and believability of the proceedings; a ""star"" would have interupted the realism of the story and surroundings. And, in the process, we get to discover a whole new set of actors (their work and camaraderie is gaspingly satisfying, the most sheerly pleasurable in recent memory).Matthew Weiner, the show's genius creator, has painstakingly ensured that we're really getting a believable early 1960s. There's not an irritatingly currently contemporary viewpoint to be found anywhere. Of course the show is depicted in a hindsight manner; but all of the dialogue, situations and characters are all breathtakingly, reassuringly of a past time. Despite the deceptively, smoothly stylized look via the posh sets and clothes, the atmosphere is constantly invaded by the smog of cigarette smoke; we're not used to seeing such flagrant puffing and inhaling on film. You can almost smell the overfilled ashtrays. No one goes outside to smoke here. This is the Martini and Rossi era, and everyone in corporate America smoked and drank as if it were part of the life and job description. Then, too, you see women used as business, sexual and marital props. They existed to serve their men (and I hope the PC feminists are in a tizzy, because they should be). To provide their dictation, their pleasure, their masculine image, their food, their offspring. Of course, we see in Joan, the foxy, knowing secretary, using the men in return to get what she wants; and we see in Don Draper's wife (brilliantly, tensely enacted by January Jones) an all-pervasive, unnameable malcontentedness. We see the glaring dichotomies of the men, looking Madison Avenue dapper, but behaving and displaying attitudes of overgrown high schoolers. Most of these men, from today's standpoint, are bastards; and no attempt is made to Ralph Nader or Alan Alda-ize them (it would be interesting to have the series run into the late 1960s, when these men are forced to run into the massive social consciousness that emerged in a shockingly short time later).Most of all though, the tone of the show is presided over by the brilliant Jon Hamm, whose Don Draper is the most multifaceted character on television in ages. Hamm is blessedly allowed several moments in deep repose, and we can see the massively disturbed soul behind the savvily successful executive. And yet the character's troubled mien allows him to understand human nature, therefore key elements in advertising - how to emotionally ensnare the public into believing the merit of a product or slogan. He's also smart enough to see that Peggy (wonderfully played by Elizabeth Moss), the secretary, with her questioning, probing mind, has a depth unavailable to most of the male executives, to provide key insights into how to sell a product. Hamm's Don Draper is already a classic, public-entrenched persona.  It is a stunningly limned portrayal.The great strength of this show is its quietly commanding, un-TV-like sense of pacing. You wouldn't call this a suspense show, yet the bottled-up, stealthy sense of pacing keeps us in a tantalizingly unnerved state; you always wait for that cork to explode unexpectedly. The brilliance here is that the explosion factor doesn't always come when we expect it; but the build-up leads us to believe it will. Those explosions come when the build-up has not been prepared, and happens in a swift, tightly controlled manner, never spilling over into predictably cheap shock value.After each show, we smile, having been on the edge of our seats, engrossed, and left deeply satisfied - and impatient for next week. Thursdays at 10:00. Phone turned off, a glass of wine or spirits.Another great asset to the overall tone is the darkly cynical humor. Never overplayed or explicitly self-conscious, it nevertheless ingeniously, deftly exposes the foibles of human nature. The most overt humor is slyly depicted by Christina Hendricks, whose eye-poppingly Kim Novak-voluptuous, leeringly confident secretary Joan is an absolute delight. Hendricks looks and acts so unerringly real of the time period, it would be a shock to see her as she really is in real life. She and John Slattery, perfectly playing the sloppily amorous boss, create genuine sexual edge in their scenes together.Vincent Kartheiser, playing Pete Campbell, an insecure, untalented but ruthlessly ambitious business and social climber, is scarily effective; there's an element of genuine danger in this character. Campbell is so aware of his limitations, and you sense he'd stop at nothing to prove himself.The good-time unreformed Frat-elevated-to-biz-executive contingent, played by Rich Sommer, Aaron Staton, Michael Gladis, and Bryan Batt, strike just the right notes; they're all joyfully oversexed, blithely good-time, but very real, and we get to see inside their characters.Robert Morse, the only familiar name in this cast, is perfect as the head of Sterling Cooper, a boss who cares not what goes on as long as the money rolls in.I hope Mad Men will be on for years to come. HBO's loss is AMC's considerable gain - and is the best-written, best acted show of our time. It will be heralded, discussed, and acclaimed for years to come, and be held as the classic show it has already become. I have never enjoyed something so much as this intriguing, wonderfully engrossing drama. Cheers and thanks to all those involved.",5,"Glorious, involving, terrific drama; best TV in years",1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,5945,"['summer', '2007', 'when', 'Mad', 'Men', 'swept', 'nation',

Season 1
1117209,A20NVE1U6G8C7N,B000YABIQ6,Nils,"[3, 3]","Madmen Season One is fun, mainly on a stylistic level.  I love the opening credits sequence. The series is an almost-faithful recreation of the visual style and culture of the early 1960s.I say almost-faithful because the inaccuracies can be a little jarring.  I lived through the 60s and remember the decade clearly. The errors are a little irritating, and were bad enough to keep taking me out of the reality of the storyline.The timeline is a little loopy.  It's 1960, then it seems to be years later, in terms of what's going on culturally in the U.S., then it's 1960 again.  They really needed a consultant who lived through the decade, connect the dots of what happened when and what caused what to happen, because the first season at least was a mishmash with some things out of order.  And they were important things.  It's as if someone were making a movie about the first decade of the 21st century, and set the events of 9-11 after, not before, the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, or showed Obama elected before George Bush, or showed texting preceding email.Beatniks were not hippies.  The first season was set in 1960, before Kennedy's election, and shows the main character meeting a bunch of beatniks, but most of them are portrayed as hippies, not beatniks.  But hippies of the type portayed were a reaction to the Vietnam war and the Kennedy assassination, which did not occur, obviously, before Kennedy was elected to office. Nixon lost partly because he didn't listen to admen.  Marshall McLuhan published ""The media is the message"" in the mid 60s, so people would not be talking about it years earlier. The visual style of the ads the admen are creating, is more reminiscent of the mid 50s than the 60s.  The problem is that ""one thing leads to another,"" so getting the order wrong makes the show lose its sense of reality on a certain level.  The producers went to such trouble to get some things right, the things they got wrong are a little jarring.",3,Pretty good but not perfect - many cultural references are off,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,1975,"['Madmen', 'Season', 'One', 'fun', 'mainly', 'stylistic', 'level', 'love', 'opening', 'credits', 'sequence', 'series', 'almost-faithful', 'recreation', 'visual', 'style', 'culture', 'early', '1960s.I', 'say', 'almost-faithful', 'inaccuracies', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'jarring', 'lived', '60s', 'remember', 'decade', 'clearly', 'errors', 'are', 'little', 'irritating', 'were', 'bad', 'enough', 'keep', 'taking', 'reality', 'storyline.The', 'timeline', 'little', 'loopy', '1960', 'then', 'be', 'years', 'later', 'terms', 'what', 'going', 'culturally', 'U.S.', 'then', '1960', 'again', 'really', 'needed', 'consultant', 'who', 'lived', 'decade', 'connect', 'dots', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'what', 'caused', 'what', 'happen', 'first', 'season', 'least', 'was', 'mishmash', 'things', 'order', 'were', 'important', 'things', 'someone', 'were', 'making', 'movie', 'first', 'decade', '21st', 'century', 'set', 'events', '9-11', 'not', 'invasions', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'showed', 'Obama', 'elected', 'George', 'Bush', 'showed', 'texting', 'preceding', 'email.Beatniks', 'were', 'not', 'hippies', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'set', '1960', 'Kennedy', 'election', 'main', 'character', 'meeting', 'bunch', 'beatniks', 'most', 'are', 'portrayed', 'hippies', 'not', 'beatniks', 'hippies', 'type', 'portayed', 'were', 'reaction', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'obviously', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'elected', 'office', 'Nixon', 'lost', 'partly', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'admen', 'Marshall', 'McLuhan', 'published', 'media', 'message', 'mid', '60s', 'so', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'talking', 'years', 'earlier', 'visual', 'style', 'ads', 'admen', 'are', 'creating', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'mid', '50s', '60s', 'problem', 'one', 'thing', 'getting', 'order', 'wrong', 'show', 'lose', 'sense', 'reality', 'certain', 'level', 'producers', 'went', 'such', 'trouble', 'get', 'things', 'right', 'things', 'got', 'wrong', 'are', 'little', 'jarring']",Mad Men: Season 1

Every time you turn around the characters are lighting up cigarettes and drinking on the job. Everything in the show seems to revolve around that. More acting would be nice. I understand smoking was a popular thing in the late 50's, early 60's but the show is guilty of overkill in this department. Show could be more interesting.

1117211,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000YABIQ6,Robert Moore,"[11, 11]","MAD MEN is one of those series that is almost impossible to praise too highly.  It is also one of those series that puts on display the inherent superiority of television to the movies.  That is a sentiment that I find offends many, but one that more and more thinking men and women are coming to embrace as television gradually turns out one amazingly intelligent series after another.  Cinema is inherently limited on how much an individual movie can achieve in developing a complex narrative just as it is limited in how deeply it can explore character.  The reason is obvious:  a lack of time.  Delving deeply into the lives of a group of characters is a luxury movies simply can't afford.  The clock is ticking.MAD MEN will, when it is finished, be a narrative of the sixties.  Season One begins in 1960k, shortly before the Kennedy-Nixon election.  Season Two moves almost two years ahead of that.  Subsequent seasons will move the story ahead by a couple of years each time, before coming to an end at the end of the decade.  The sixties was clearly the most remarkable decade of the twentieth century.  The world of 1970 has more in common with today in many ways than it did to 1960.  The changes in our attitudes can scarcely be assessed.  At the beginning of the series women all have their place in the office as servants to the men, accept passively their roles as eye candy and objects of sexual innuendo, and aspire to no more than moving up the secretarial rank.  A gay man in the office is so completely in the office that he seems oblivious to his homosexuality.  But by the end of decade would come the Stonewall riots and the Second Wave of the women's movement would be in full bloom.One of the dominant themes of the show is the contrast between the world of today and the world of ""then.""  One of the most striking moments in Season One comes when Betty Draper's daughter runs into the living room wearing a body length plastic launderer's bag.  Betty sharply upbraids her, hoping that this doesn't mean that her laundry is laying on the floor.  To modern sensibility a child wearing a deadly plastic bad is shocking.  Or in a late season episode Don Draper allows his completely drunk boss to leave his house with a drink ""for the road.""  He merely smiles when he shouts, ""That's my car!"" as Roger drunkenly tries to find his own.  A pregnant woman at a party can be seen smoking while holding a martini glass.  One of my favorite MAD MEN scenes comes in Season Two, when after a picnic with his wife and kids, Don shakes the blanket they have all been sitting on, leaving the paper and trash on the ground.  It all highlights some of the progress we have made in disciplining some of our more indefensible behavior.As others have noted, the show centers on several ad executives at the Sterling-Cooper advertising firm.  In particular, the film focuses on Don Draper, a brilliantly creative ad exec who has been just as inventive in recreating himself as he has been in promoting the products of the firm's clients.  A serial adulterer, the child of a prostitute who died giving birth to him, and the son of an abusive father, he has had to pull himself from his humble origins to the top of his profession.  All this while protecting his own dark secrets.  Don Draper is a great character, perhaps the most archetypal character to have arisen since Tony Soprano.  And it provided the opportunity for overnight stardom for Jon Hamm, a previously only marginally successful actor who had mainly been distinguished by a string of very small parts on various TV series and small budget movies.  But it is impossible to imagine anyone more perfect for this role than Hamm and series creator Matthew Weiner agreed after seeing his audition tapes.  When the network insisted that Hamm be passed over for a more established actor, Weiner declared that without Hamm he was not willing to move forward with the series.  Weiner won and Hamm went on to win a Golden Globe and an Emmy nomination (which he should have won).  As portrayed by Hamm, Don Draper is the complete embodiment of Thoreau's individual who lives a life of quiet desperation.  Draper is a world of contradictions.  At times unscrupulous, he is also capable of great magnanimity and moral rectitude.  A womanizer, he yearns for the ideal home.The cast is stuffed with great characters and wonderful performances.  I absolutely detested Vincent Kartheiser as Connor on the series ANGEL, though even then I suspected it was more the way he was written than his performance.  Though he isn't asked to perform acts of daring do on MAD MEN, he is exceptional as Peter Campbell.  Like Don Draper he alternates from petty, self-serving moments to acts of kindness and loyalty.  He is capable of being wonderfully protective of Peggy Olson, a woman with whom he has had a couple of moments of physical intimacy, though he can also behave viciously towards her.  John Slattery is outstanding as Roger Sterling, the number two man in the firm and the son of the Sterling-Cooper cofounder.  Robert Morse, the great Broadway musical star of the sixties (including HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING), plays Bertram Cooper, the head of the firm.  The almost unbearably beautiful January Jones (at one point in the season much is made of her resemblance to Grace Kelly, and she is gorgeous enough to make it not a silly compliment).  Not to jump ahead to Season Two, Jones performance over the two seasons as Don Draper's trophy wife Betty is noting short of brilliant.  Betty is someone who detests her life as a beautiful manikin, but isn't able to achieve happiness because she doesn't know who she wants to become.  She also provides many of Season One's great moments, none better than when she starts killing the carrier pigeons of her next door neighbor with an air rifle (with cigarette dangling from her mouth) after he tells her children that he will kill their dog if they don't keep him out of his yard.  The gorgeous Christina Hendricks (who wears some padding to make her figure more Rubenesque and who was wonderful in the recurring role of Saffron on the Sci-fi series FIREFLY) plays Joan Holloway, the office manager.After Don Draper, however, my favorite character on the show is Peggy Olson (Elizabeth Moss).  The series actually begins with Peggy's first day as a Sterling-Cooper employee.  Starting off as Don Draper's secretary, she soon shows that she has skills as a writer, and soon becomes valued as a copy writer with a sensitivity for products that appeal to women.  I've told friends that I believe that by the end of the series Peggy will actually be the head of Sterling-Cooper.  I think the centrality of Peggy to the show was shown partly by the show commencing with her first day there and with her unprecedented penetration of the all male hierarchy of the corporation.  Viewers may notice that she gains weight over the course of the year, especially during the last half.  In fact Elizabeth Moss gained no weight.  All changes were the result of very sophisticated make up art and padded clothing.MAD MEN is one of the most beautifully designed shows you'll ever hope to see.  It may be surpassed by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and PUSHING DAISIES in art design, but no show on television rivals it in clothing.  The look of the show is impeccable.  If you don't remember the sixties, you can relive them by watching this show.This is a show that anyone serious about quality TV has to know well.  I've watched Season One twice and plan on rewatching Season One and Two as soon as the latter has finished.  MAD MEN is also an example of a new trend in television, a series that tells more or less a unified story over the course of its life.  LOST and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA both are doing this as well.  All are must-see shows.",5,One of the finest series on television,1222905600,"10 2, 2008",2008,7840,"['MAD', 'MEN', 'one', 'series', 'almost', 'impossible', 'praise', 'too', 'highly', 'also', 'one',

Everyone in the series does what they think they should do, play the roles they think they should play with glee, all while being worried sick that underneath there is pain, unhappiness and baseness, and not much else.""The universe is indifferent"", Don Draper says at one point, coalescing the characters' reaction to the void. Fill it up with instinctive desires and lust for dominance and power and get away with as much as you can. Meanwhile, they live with and romance complete strangers, and immerse themselves in their pre-cut roles while trying to avoid the unseen force that drives their behavior. When calamity strikes these souls, granite shells are exploded and inside there are often scared little children who are ill-equipped to deal with real life and real emotions that they are secretly victims of.Mad Men shows people doing what's expected of them without bothering to do what they are supposed to do-on Madison Avenue, near the heights of success, as the opening of each episode shows, it's a long way down to the annihilation of everything they are, and a long time to think about it in descent.",5,"TV for readers, blistering social criticism",1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,1380,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'repeat', 'good', 'reviews', 'are', 'true', 'singularly', 'great', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Mad', 'Men', 'was', 'meditation', 'existentialism', 'how', 'close', 'America', 'flirted', 'nothingness', 'having', 'Everyone', 'series', 'what', 'think', 'should', 'do', 'play', 'roles', 'think', 'should', 'play', 'glee', 'being', 'worried', 'sick', 'underneath', 'pain', 'unhappiness', 'baseness', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'universe', 'indifferent', 'Don', 'Draper', 'one', 'point', 'coalescing', 'characters', 'reaction', 'void', 'Fill', 'up', 'instinctive', 'desires', 'lust', 'dominance', 'power', 'get', 'away', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'Meanwhile', 'live', 'romance', 'complete', 'strangers', 'immerse', 'pre-cut', 'roles', 'trying', 'avoid', 'unseen', 'force', 'behavior', 'When', 'calamity', 'souls', 'granite', 'shells', 'are', 'exploded', 'are', 'often', 'scared', 'little', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'ill-equipped', 'deal', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'emotions', 'are', 'secretly', 'victims', 'Men', 'people', 'doing', 'what', 'expected', 'bothering', 'do', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'do-on', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'heights', 'success', 'opening', 'episode', 'long', 'way', 'annihilation', 'everything', 'are', 'long', 'time', 'think', 'descent']",Mad Men: Season 1

The wives were catty and cruel, as were the &#34;girls&#34; in the secretarial pool.There is no character, not one single character, in this series who is sympathetic or likeable or interesting. They're all awful, every last one of them. No one is a true friend. No one is kind. No one seems to have a single worn thread of humanity in them.

Jon Hamm as Donald Draper is one of the most complex characters I have ever seen.

1117218,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B000YABIQ6,Traveler,"[119, 130]","Mad Men is one of those very rare TV shows that is both superb and popular.  Sometimes there really is a TV god.  Unlike great shows like Friday Night Lights, people are watching and the awards are rolling in - 16 Emmy nominations, more than any other drama this year.It's 1960 in a Manhattan based advertising agency.  The men have slicked back hair, crisp white shirts and perfect suits.  What comes out of their mouths would get them slapped or sued if it happened today.  Toots, babe, honey.  Women are sex objects and they have less brain power - as one character says, ""It was like watching a dog play the piano"" when a certain female character with professional drive and passion exceeds the lowly expectations of the men.The women are no better.  The head secretary tells another female that they (the men) designed the technology so simple that even a woman can use it.  A mother smokes and drinks while pregnant and ignores the danger of a nearby child playing make believe with a plastic drying cleaning bag over her head.  Some of the women act childish because that's the role that's been forced upon them.  Others are starting to reject the social strait jacket and are rebelling - it's the beginning of a new era and they are the foremothers of what is about to hit this nation like a baseball bat to the head.The wall paper in one house is plaid and the cars are big and many have tail fins.  There's a cigarette in almost every scene - people cough and there's no recognition of any connection in their minds.  One major character smokes, drinks and eats with abandon and almost dies of a heart attack with, again, no recognition of cause and effect.This show, unlike any on air or cable at this time, immerses you in its era.  It's authentic, real and grabs your attention.  Quite simply, if you watch only one current show on TV this year it should be Mad Men.Several reviewers have commented on the packaging.  While it is a little more delicate than others, it's still cool (it's like a cigarette lighter) and you can handle the DVDs without damaging them.  The DVDs are held in the case with a foam insert that doesn't scratch the surface.  When you take the DVDs out you have to gently push against the top side with your (clean) fingers and gently push upward.  They will come out and you won't smudge or scratch the surface.  If the DVDs are getting damaged it's because people are just grabbing both sides of the disc and pulling it out.  Unlike other reviewers, I have not been impressed with other boxed sets where you end up literally breaking the plastic sprockets that hold the DVDs in place.  If you want really poor packaging just look at the complete West Wing.  In any case, you can handle these DVDs and not damage them.The extras here are sparse but very good nonetheless.  There's an hour long behind the scenes docu that looks as all aspects of the show from character backgrounds to hair and art design to the actors feelings about their characters.  It's not full of that fluffy hype stuff you find on other DVD sets where they just show you short clips from the show and present it as somehow something new.  You'll actually learn something about the show.  I would love to see full interviews with all the actors to talk about the characters they're playing.  Maybe we'll get that in the season 2 set.  As noted by others, the commentaries are minimal and a bit disappointing.  Doesn't really matter in the end as it's still a superb show you simply shouldn't miss.",5,"Immerse yourself in the tone, texture and feel of an era",1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,3508,"['Mad', 'Men', 'one', 'very', 'rare', 'TV', 'shows', 'superb', 'popular', 'Sometimes', 'really', 'TV', 'god', 'great', 'shows', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'people', 'are', 'watching', 'awards', 'are', 'rolling', '16', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'more', 'other', 'drama', 'year.It', '1960', 'Manhattan', 'based', 'advertising', 'agency', 'men', 'have', 'slicked', 'back', 'hair', 'crisp', 'white', 'shirts', 'perfect', 'suits', 'What', 'mouths', 'would', 'get', 'slapped', 'sued', 'happened', 'today', 'Toots', 'babe', 'honey', 'Women', 'are', 'sex', 'objects', 'have', 'less', 'brain', 'power', 'one', 'character', 'was', 'watching', 'dog', 'play', 'piano', 'when', 'certain', 'female', 'character', 'professional', 'drive', 'passion', 'lowly', 'expectations', 'men.The', 'women', 'are', 'better', 'head', 'secretary', 'female', 'men', 'designed', 'technology', 'so', 'simple', 'even', 'woman', 'can', 'use', 'mother', 'smokes', 'drinks', 'pregnant', 'danger', 'nearby', 'child', 'playing', 'make', 'believe', 'plastic', 'drying', 'cleaning', 'bag', 'head', 'women', 'act', 'childish', 'role', 'been', 'forced', 'Others', 'are', 'starting', 'reject', 'social', 'strait', 'jacket', 'are', 'rebelling', 'beginning', 'new', 'era', 'are', 'foremothers', 'what', 'hit', 'nation', 'baseball', 'bat', 'head.The', 'wall', 'paper', 'one', 'house', 'plaid', 'cars', 'are', 'big', 'many', 'have', 'tail', 'fins', 'cigarette', 'almost', 'scene', 'people', 'cough', 'recognition', 'connection', 'minds', 'One', 'major', 'character', 'smokes', 'drinks', 'eats', 'abandon', 'almost', 'dies', 'heart', 'attack', 'again', 'recognition', 'cause', 'effect.This', 'show', 'air', 'cable', 'time', 'immerses', 'era', 'authentic', 'real', 'grabs', 'attention', 'Quite', 'simply', 'watch', 'only', 'one', 'current', 'show', 'TV', 'year', 'should', 'be', 'Mad', 'Men.Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'packaging', 'little', 'more', 'delicate', 'others', 'still', 'cool', 'cigarette', 'lighter', 'can', 'handle', 'DVDs', 'damaging', 'DVDs', 'are', 'held', 'case', 'foam', 'insert', ""n't"", 'scratch', 'surface', 'When', 'take', 'DVDs', 'have', 'gently', 'push', 'top', 'side', 'clean', 'fingers', 'gently', 'push', 'upward', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'smudge', 'scratch', 'surface', 'DVDs', 'are', 'getting', 'damaged', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'grabbing', 'sides', 'disc', 'pulling', 'out', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'impressed', 'other', 'boxed', 'sets', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'literally', 'breaking', 'plastic', 'sprockets', 'hold', 'DVDs', 'place', 'want', 'really', 'poor', 'packaging', 'just', 'look', 'complete', 'West', 'Wing', 'case', 'can', 'handle', 'DVDs', 'not', 'damage', 'them.The', 'extras', 'here', 'are', 'sparse', 'very', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'hour', 'long', 'scenes', 'docu', 'aspects', 'show', 'character', 'backgrounds', 'hair', 'art', 'design', 'actors', 'feelings', 'characters', 'not', 'full', 'fluffy', 'hype', 'stuff', 'find', 'other', 'DVD', 'sets', 'where', 'just', 'show', 'short', 'clips', 'show', 'present', 'somehow', 'something', 'new', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'learn', 'something', 'show', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'full', 'interviews', 'actors', 'talk', 'characters', ""'re"", 'playing', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'get', 'season', '2', 'set', 'noted', 'others', 'commentaries', 'are', 'minimal', 'bit', 'disappointing', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'end', 'still', 'superb', 'show', 'simply', 'should', ""n't"", 'miss']",Mad Men: Season 1
1117219,A107ZX1O8JZCN5,B000YABIQ6,"Vicki Hopkins, Author ""Vicki Hopkins, Author""","[1, 1]","Mad Men caught my eye as soon as I read that it was set in the 1960's.  Ah, the 1960's. I was 10 in 1960; graduated from high school in 1968.  Watching this television show brings back not only my childhood, but my teenage years as well.  Everything from Selectric typewriters, to switchboards, phones with blinking buttons, eating raw hamburger, and living with parents that smoked and drank as a normal part of life. Add to that list driving drunk, driving without seat belts, kids playing with plastic bags over their head, pregnant women drinking and smoking, and other shocking behavior to curl our toes.Set in New York City in the heyday of advertising agencies in Manhattan, it's an eclectic weave of husbands, housewives, mistresses, secretaries, office politics, and account executives.  It reminds me of those days when anything went.  Men made sexual innuendos to the female office staff, booze was in the offices, and everyone smoked like a chimney. My first time someone flirted with me at my second job in 1969, the bank manager came up and told me I had ""great legs.""  Then in 1972 my boss had me stay late one night and came up behind me and grabbed my breasts.  Wow, I could have sued had that happened today.On top of the outlandish days of sexual harassment in the office, it's mixed with the occurrence of segregation where Negros couldn't ride in the elevators with the working staff unless given permission.  Everyone in the company was white - no mixing of the races like our modern offices today.  Jewish people were treated like aliens that couldn't be understood.  Everyone drank and smoked.  I can remember my first boss in 1968 having a bottle of booze stashed in his desk drawer.  Most of the day he smelled of alcohol.Then there were the women who stayed home - the housewives.  Always with their hair in place, their bouncy little dresses, their kids clean, their houses spotless, and dinner waiting on the table when their husbands came home.  They knew their place, and they kept their place whether they were miserable or happy. It was their way of life, along with eating prime rib and butter for dinner.  The men, of course, lived doubled lives of carousing with other women and having mistresses on the side in or out of the office setting. Married women, who met a divorced woman with two children living alone, was an unthinkable state of affairs.The characters are wonderful, with their own back story of how their childhood and family has molded them into the adults they have become.  Each have their own personal struggles, whether it be with self-worth, a family they wish to forget, a wife with whom they are estranged, an overbearing mother who filled their daughters with expectations, or a father who doesn't support their son's career choice.  The stories are rich in their own right and filled with everybody's pursuit of happiness in the 60's, in one way or the other. Rather than worrying about their smoking, drinking, or butter on their plates, the Communists are the threats, as well as the thought of having a Catholic president.I can't tell you how utterly entertaining this show is, at least for me.  If you didn't grow up in that era, you'll probably find it very strange.  If you did, it will be like walking down memory lane, remembering your childhood, and no doubt your parents.  I can still see my mother who wore a dress every day, had dinner on the table, who hadn't worked out of the home since World War II.  Yes, we have evolved in many ways.  Discrimination and sexism in the office is a thing of the past.  Feminism has taken the women out of the homes and made them executives along side men.  However, a part of me misses the simplicity of those days when life had different complications than we face today.One of my favorites are the girls in the office and how they share the gossip.  A particular scene that had me rolling on the floor happened to be when one lady pulled from her purse the novel, ""Lady Chatterley's Lover,"" and the women started talking about it.  Of course, it's strictly taboo to read such a book that uses the words no lady would utter and contain such graphic sexual scenes in a book!  One woman asks if she can borrow it to read, and the advice was priceless.  ""Don't read it on the train.  It will attract all the wrong elements.""  What a hoot!  Reminded me of today and women reading Fifty Shades of Grey in public.  Things never really change in some aspects.  We just color it in a different light.Anyway, highly recommend the show.",5,Nostalgia at Its Best,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,4536,"['Mad', 'Men', 'caught', 'eye', 'as', 'soon', 'read', 'was', 'set', '1960', 'Ah', '1960', 'was', '10', '1960', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', '1968', 'Watching', 'television', 'show', 'back', 'not', 'only', 'childhood', 'teenage', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'Everything', 'Selectric', 'typewriters', 'switchboards', 'phones', 'blinking', 'buttons', 'eating', 'raw', 'hamburger', 'living', 'parents', 'smoked', 'drank', 'normal', 'part', 'life', 'Add', 'list', 'driving', 'drunk', 'driving', 'seat', 'belts', 'kids', 'playing', 'plastic', 'bags', 'head', 'pregnant', 'women', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'other', 'shocking', 'behavior', 'curl', 'toes.Set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'heyday', 'advertising', 'agencies', 'Manhattan', 'eclectic', 'weave', 'husbands', 'housewives', 'mistresses', 'secretaries', 'office', 'politics', 'account', 'executives', 'days', 'when', 'anything', 'went', 'Men', 'made', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'female', 'office', 'staff', 'booze', 'was', 'offices', 'everyone', 'smoked', 'chimney', 'first', 'time', 'someone', 'flirted', 'second', 'job', '1969', 'bank', 'manager', 'came', 'up', 'told', 'had', 'great', 'legs', 'Then', '1972', 'boss', 'had', 'stay', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'came', 'up', 'grabbed', 'breasts', 'Wow', 'could', 'have', 'sued', 'had', 'happened', 'today.On', 'top', 'outlandish', 'days', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'office', 'mixed', 'occurrence', 'segregation', 'where', 'Negros', 'could', ""n't"", 'ride', 'elevators', 'working', 'staff', 'given', 'permission', 'Everyone', 'company', 'was', 'white', 'mixing', 'races', 'modern', 'offices', 'today', 'Jewish', 'people', 'were', 'treated', 'aliens', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'understood', 'Everyone', 'drank', 'smoked', 'can', 'remember', 'first', 'boss', '1968', 'having', 'bottle', 'booze', 'stashed', 'desk', 'drawer', 'Most', 'day', 'smelled', 'alcohol.Then', 'were', 'women', 'who', 'stayed', 'home', 'housewives', 'Always', 'hair', 'place', 'bouncy', 'little', 'dresses', 'kids', 'clean', 'houses', 'spotless', 'dinner', 'waiting', 'table', 'when', 'husbands', 'came', 'home', 'knew', 'place', 'kept', 'place', 'were', 'miserable', 'happy', 'was', 'way', 'life', 'eating', 'prime', 'rib', 'butter', 'dinner', 'men', 'course', 'lived', 'doubled', 'lives', 'carousing', 'other', 'women', 'having', 'mistresses', 'side', 'office', 'setting', 'Married', 'women', 'who', 'met', 'divorced', 'woman', 'two', 'children', 'living', 'alone', 'was', 'unthinkable', 'state', 'affairs.The', 'characters', 'are', 'wonderful', 'own', 'back', 'story', 'how', 'childhood', 'family', 'molded', 'adults', 'have', 'become', 'have', 'own', 'personal', 'struggles', 'be', 'self-worth', 'family', 'wish', 'forget', 'wife', 'whom', 'are', 'estranged', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'who', 'filled', 'daughters', 'expectations', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'support', 'son', 'career', 'choice', 'stories', 'are', 'rich', 'own', 'right', 'filled', 'everybody', 'pursuit', 'happiness', '60', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'Rather', 'worrying', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'butter', 'plates', 'Communists', 'are', 'threats', 'as', 'well', 'thought', 'having', 'Catholic', 'president.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'utterly', 'entertaining', 'show', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'era', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'very', 'strange', 'did', 'will', 'be', 'walking', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'remembering', 'childhood', 'doubt', 'parents', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'mother', 'who', 'wore', 'dress', 'day', 'had', 'dinner', 'table', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'worked', 'home', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Yes', 'have', 'evolved', 'many', 'ways', 'Discrimination', 'sexism', 'office', 'thing', 'past', 'Feminism', 'taken', 'women', 'homes', 'made', 'executives', 'side', 'men', 'However', 'part', 'simplicity', 'days', 'when', 'life', 'had', 'different', 'complications', 'face', 'today.One', 'favorites', 'are', 'girls', 'office', 'how', 'share', 'gossip', 'particular', 'scene', 'had', 'rolling', 'floor', 'happened', 'be', 'when', 'one', 'lady', 'pulled', 'purse', 'novel', 'Lady', 'Chatterley', 'Lover', 'women', 'started', 'talking', 'course', 'strictly', 'taboo', 'read', 'book', 'words', 'lady', 'would', 'utter', 'contain', 'such', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'book', 'One', 'woman', 'can', 'borrow', 'read', 'advice', 'was', 'priceless', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'train', 'will', 'attract', 'wrong', 'elements', 'What', 'hoot', 'Reminded', 'today', 'women', 'reading', 'Fifty', 'Shades', 'Grey', 'public', 'Things', 'never', 'really', 'change', 'aspects', 'just', 'color', 'different', 'light.Anyway', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show']",Mad Men: Season 1

Somebody is doing a fantastic job of art direction, re-creating 1960 right down to the last detail--and let's not forget all those drinks and cigarettes!They are also right on the money with the frustrated housewives and their unfaithful, dissatisfied husbands; the alpha male world of advertising executives; the barely contained sexual energy of the women who work as their secretaries.Jon Hamm is spot-on as Donald Draper, the creative director with the seemingly perfect life but a questionable past that he wants to leave behind but cannot; Elisabeth Moss is admirable as his secretary, Peggy, who looks like a pig-tailed school girl but has a tough and secretive side that is slowly revealed.The actors portraying Betty Draper, Peter Campbell (who knew that a smarmy little buggar could be a cad at the same time?), Roger Sterling, Burt Cooper, and others are an equal match for Hamm and Moss.  All of the work from the cast and crew has paid off in a big and well-deserved way.",5,"A rarely seen era, beautifully reproduced",1217548800,"08 1, 2008",2008,1115,"['wonder', 'show', 'getting', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'nothing', 'else', 'TV', 'there', 'been', 'quite', 'time', 'Somebody', 'doing', 'fantastic', 'job', 'art', 'direction', 're-creating', '1960', 'right', 'down', 'last', 'detail', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'drinks', 'cigarettes', 'are', 'also', 'right', 'money', 'frustrated', 'housewives', 'unfaithful', 'dissatisfied', 'husbands', 'alpha', 'male', 'world', 'advertising', 'executives', 'barely', 'contained', 'sexual', 'energy', 'women', 'who', 'work', 'secretaries.Jon', 'Hamm', 'spot-on', 'Donald', 'Draper', 'creative', 'director', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'life', 'questionable', 'past', 'leave', 'can', 'not', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'admirable', 'secretary', 'Peggy', 'who', 'pig-tailed', 'school', 'girl', 'tough', 'secretive', 'side', 'slowly', 'revealed.The', 'actors', 'portraying', 'Betty', 'Draper', 'Peter', 'Campbell', 'who', 'knew', 'smarmy', 'little', 'buggar', 'could', 'be', 'cad', 'same', 'time', 'Roger', 'Sterling', 'Burt', 'Cooper', 'others', 'are', 'equal', 'match', 'Hamm', 'Moss', 'work', 'cast', 'crew', 'paid', 'off', 'big', 'well-deserved', 'way']",Mad Men: Season 1

1117222,AP3B615GM191G,B000YABIQ6,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","On the outside, ""Mad Men"" didn't look like a show I would really get into.  I generally prefer mysteries, science fiction, or political thrillers.  After watching just an episode or two of this show, however, I was quickly hooked.  Why?  It just does SO MANY things right.For a basic plot summary, ""Mad Men: Season One"" is the story of advertising firm Sterling Cooper in 1960.  Under the jocular yet focused direction of Roger Sterling (John Slattery), Donald Draper (Jon Hamm) is the top ad man in the company.  At first glance, it seems like an ""idyllic society"" where the men work and are supported by the women in their lives.  Yet, we quickly come to find that the stereotypes and prejudices of the time (especially involving women and health) are not nearly as ideal as they seem.  It is a ""simpler"" time, no doubt, but only in a certain definition of that word ""simple"".Trying to summarize this first season would take volumes, because there is just so much going on.  Here are the key points that really impressed me:-The almost surreal nature of the advertising business at that time.  Draper and his crew have extremely high-pressure jobs that produce high drama, yet the atmosphere is like a ""good 'ole boys"" club, complete with attitudes, jokes, and actions that would be abhorrent today.-The role of women on the show.  Betty Draper (January Jones), secretary Peggy (Elisabeth Moss), and office ""matron"" Joan (Christine Hendricks) are all examples of the unique struggles of females during that time period.-The way the show really puts you into the 1960s.  Some period pieces can seem ""old"", but this one feels real.Perhaps the hallmark of the entire first season, however, is the notion of the viewer trying to separate the ""fantasy"" from the ""reality"".  I did not live through the 1960s, so I cannot directly comment on the accuracy of the social barometer shown in the series, but it was fascinating to me to wonder if this is how people once lived in our country.  It isn't better or it isn't worse than today's life, just...different.Overall, I will continue to watch ""Mad Men"" into the second season because I am hooked on the characters and their predicaments.",5,"The Height Of Character Drama And A Wonderful ""Period Piece"" To Boot",1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,2182,"['outside', 'Mad', 'Men', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'show', 'would', 'really', 'get', 'generally', 'prefer', 'mysteries', 'science', 'fiction', 'political', 'thrillers', 'watching', 'just', 'episode', 'two', 'show', 'however', 'was', 'quickly', 'hooked', 'Why', 'just', 'SO', 'MANY', 'things', 'right.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Season', 'One', 'story', 'advertising', 'firm', 'Sterling', 'Cooper', '1960', 'jocular', 'yet', 'focused', 'direction', 'Roger', 'Sterling', 'John', 'Slattery', 'Donald', 'Draper', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'top', 'ad', 'man', 'company', 'first', 'glance', 'idyllic', 'society', 'where', 'men', 'work', 'are', 'supported', 'women', 'lives', 'quickly', 'come', 'find', 'stereotypes', 'prejudices', 'time', 'especially', 'involving', 'women', 'health', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'ideal', 'seem', 'simpler', 'time', 'doubt', 'only', 'certain', 'definition', 'word', 'simple', '.Trying', 'summarize', 'first', 'season', 'would', 'take', 'volumes', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'Here', 'are', 'key', 'points', 'really', 'impressed', '-The', 'almost', 'surreal', 'nature', 'advertising', 'business', 'time', 'Draper', 'crew', 'have', 'extremely', 'high-pressure', 'jobs', 'produce', 'high', 'drama', 'atmosphere', 'good', ""'ole"", 'boys', 'club', 'complete', 'attitudes', 'jokes', 'actions', 'would', 'be', 'abhorrent', 'today.-The', 'role', 'women', 'show', 'Betty', 'Draper', 'January', 'Jones', 'secretary', 'Peggy', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'office', 'matron', 'Joan', 'Christine', 'Hendricks', 'are', 'examples', 'unique', 'struggles', 'females', 'time', 'period.-The', 'way', 'show', 'really', '1960s', 'period', 'pieces', 'can', 'seem', 'old', 'one', 'hallmark', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'however', 'notion', 'viewer', 'trying', 'separate', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'did', 'not', 'live', '1960s', 'can', 'not', 'directly', 'comment', 'accuracy', 'social', 'barometer', 'shown', 'series', 'was', 'fascinating', 'wonder', 'how', 'people', 'once', 'lived', 'country', ""n't"", 'better', ""n't"", 'worse', 'today', 'life', 'just', 'different.Overall', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'Mad', 'Men', 'second', 'season', 'am', 'hooked', 'characters', 'predicaments']",Mad Men: Season 1
