My aunt actually kept the VHS copies for me and gave them to me when I found out I was pregnant, and I would have had them copied to DVD if I hadn't found the DVDs on here! I'm so glad I did. I used to watch these every day and I knew all the songs and rhymes. I think learning nursery rhymes helps teach kids memorization which is important in school when learning multiplication tables and things like that.We bought Vol 1 and Vol 2. So far we've only watched one volume. While I was watching it I was remembering some of the songs and its so weird that I remember them from so long ago. My husband had these videos as a kid too and he was also laughing because he remembered some of the songs too.The DVD is super cheesy and not made with the latest in special effects technology. But its fun and goofy and kids love that kind of stuff. The costumes in particular are hilarious. One of the main characters is a giant talking, honking goose. Its ridiculous fun, perfect for kids. I enjoy watching it with my daughter since I look back and think, ""I can't believe this was my favorite video!""It definitely holds my daughter's attention and she already knows many of the rhymes from her other Mother Goose bookThe Real Mother Goose, Anniversary Editionwhich she also loves.",5,We Love These,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,1365,"['loved', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'hoping', 'could', 'find', 'mine', 'one', 'day', 'DVD', 'aunt', 'actually', 'kept', 'VHS', 'copies', 'gave', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'pregnant', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'copied', 'DVD', 'had', ""n't"", 'found', 'DVDs', 'here', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'used', 'watch', 'day', 'knew', 'songs', 'rhymes', 'think', 'learning', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'teach', 'kids', 'memorization', 'important', 'school', 'when', 'learning', 'multiplication', 'tables', 'things', 'that.We', 'bought', 'Vol', '1', 'Vol', '2', 'So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'one', 'volume', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'remembering', 'songs', 'so', 'weird', 'remember', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'husband', 'had', 'videos', 'kid', 'too', 'was', 'also', 'laughing', 'remembered', 'songs', 'too.The', 'DVD', 'super', 'cheesy', 'not', 'made', 'latest', 'special', 'effects', 'technology', 'fun', 'goofy', 'kids', 'love', 'kind', 'stuff', 'costumes', 'particular', 'are', 'hilarious', 'One', 'main', 'characters', 'giant', 'talking', 'honking', 'goose', 'ridiculous', 'fun', 'perfect', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'daughter', 'look', 'back', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'favorite', 'video', 'definitely', 'daughter', 'attention', 'already', 'many', 'rhymes', 'other', 'Mother', 'Goose', 'Real', 'Mother', 'Goose', 'Anniversary', 'Editionwhich', 'also']",Mother Goose Treasury - Vol. 1
550604,AKZSYXE0L7ETR,B00004TJMR,"Cassandra Ahmad ""Movie Buff""","[1, 1]","I remember this dvd from when I was a kid. I use to go to my grandmother and first thing I would watch was this dvd and I loved it. I had forgotten all about it till one day i was looking for some dvd's for my kids and came across and bought it immediatly. My 3 year old loves it, and it is the only dvd he actually acts out and sings with them. He even started doing the alphabet after he was watching this movie. He was never a fan sesame street, but this movies he loves, and I definatly believe because it is the overacting and he can understand better.I think this DVD is perfect for children. It tells all the nursery rhymes and stories you remember from your childhood, and introduces in them in a fun way for kids. I think the most important thing is how this dvd is set up for children. Of course to an adult the puppets look fake and the scenery you can tell is not real. Give it a break it is from the 1980's, you can't expect it to look like things do now. But kids don't pay attention to this at all, and don't know. This DVD was made for kids not adults. Also kids always love overacting and being silly. This is the reason I think this dvd is perfect for them. I mean how many times will a kid watch something that's serious without some fun in it and overacting.The only thing I find is the cast mostly is too old for the parts there they're playing, but i believe the reason is because they wanted to make sure they had good singing in the movie.Very simple if your looking for something for your children to watch and enjoy singing and nursery ryhmes then this is it. If your looking something for yourself just then of course i wouldn't recommend this.",5,Perfect For Children,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,1671,"['remember', 'dvd', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'use', 'go', 'grandmother', 'first', 'thing', 'would', 'watch', 'was', 'dvd', 'loved', 'had', 'forgotten', 'till', 'one', 'day', 'i', 'was', 'looking', 'dvd', 'kids', 'came', 'bought', 'immediatly', '3', 'year', 'old', 'only', 'dvd', 'actually', 'out', 'sings', 'even', 'started', 'doing', 'alphabet', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'sesame', 'street', 'movies', 'definatly', 'believe', 'overacting', 'can', 'understand', 'better.I', 'think', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'children', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'stories', 'remember', 'childhood', 'introduces', 'fun', 'way', 'kids', 'think', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'how', 'dvd', 'set', 'up', 'children', 'course', 'adult', 'puppets', 'look', 'fake', 'scenery', 'can', 'tell', 'not', 'real', 'Give', 'break', '1980', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'look', 'things', 'do', 'now', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'DVD', 'was', 'made', 'kids', 'not', 'adults', 'Also', 'always', 'love', 'overacting', 'being', 'silly', 'reason', 'think', 'dvd', 'perfect', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'will', 'kid', 'watch', 'something', 'serious', 'fun', 'only', 'thing', 'find', 'cast', 'mostly', 'too', 'old', 'parts', 'there', ""'re"", 'playing', 'i', 'believe', 'reason', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'had', 'good', 'singing', 'movie.Very', 'simple', 'looking', 'something', 'children', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'singing', 'nursery', 'ryhmes', 'then', 'looking', 'something', 'just', 'then', 'course', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend']",Mother Goose Treasury - Vol. 1
