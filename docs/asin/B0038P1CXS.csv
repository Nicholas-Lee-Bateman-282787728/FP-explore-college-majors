1332893,A3UWYCISNFHO2X,B0038P1CXS,albarino,"[7, 7]","This film is a layered story (WWII in France and Germany seen through a group of 4 - 5 GIs) that hangs together despite some shortcomings. These include uneven acting, though some performances are fine. The film seems shot with a hand-held camera so much of the story is taken close in. I thought this more or less worked, overcoming the forced acting that occurs here and there. But I did feel that the scenes tended to get a bit claustrophobic after awhile. Cinematic rhythm requires a balance of close-ups, mid- and long-shots to register with the viewer.The script is solid, and does a good job in giving some humanity to the Germans when they appear, unlike the overpraised Saving Private Ryan which I felt became melodramatic and jingoistic in the second half. One of the more poignant scenes is the suicide of a devastated German infantryman at the end of the film. The director pulls back his camera to frame his fallen form and the helpless Sgt. Smith against a late afternoon lake. Thankfully, he holds us there, evoking honest emotion and compassion.The combat scenes of EW are quite intense and chaotic -- quickly edited, and I found this to be an asset overall. It conveyed the rush and confusion of infantry combat.Viewed at home, and for best effect, I recommend at least a 35 "" screen with the volume set higher.",4,"honest, engaging  effort from a low budget",1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,1328,"['film', 'layered', 'story', 'WWII', 'France', 'Germany', 'seen', 'group', '4', '5', 'GIs', 'together', 'shortcomings', 'include', 'uneven', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'film', 'shot', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'taken', 'close', 'thought', 'more', 'less', 'worked', 'overcoming', 'forced', 'acting', 'here', 'there', 'did', 'feel', 'scenes', 'tended', 'get', 'bit', 'claustrophobic', 'awhile', 'Cinematic', 'rhythm', 'balance', 'close-ups', 'mid-', 'long-shots', 'register', 'viewer.The', 'script', 'solid', 'good', 'job', 'giving', 'humanity', 'Germans', 'when', 'appear', 'overpraised', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'felt', 'became', 'melodramatic', 'jingoistic', 'second', 'half', 'One', 'more', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'suicide', 'devastated', 'German', 'infantryman', 'end', 'film', 'director', 'back', 'camera', 'frame', 'fallen', 'form', 'helpless', 'Sgt', 'Smith', 'late', 'afternoon', 'lake', 'Thankfully', 'there', 'evoking', 'honest', 'emotion', 'compassion.The', 'combat', 'scenes', 'EW', 'are', 'quite', 'intense', 'chaotic', 'quickly', 'edited', 'found', 'be', 'asset', 'overall', 'conveyed', 'rush', 'confusion', 'infantry', 'combat.Viewed', 'home', 'best', 'effect', 'recommend', 'least', '35', 'screen', 'volume', 'set', 'higher']",N/A

That being said they are willing to stay and fight in what they believe in. The germans in this movie are depicted as human beings as well.  In fact the main narrator runs into a german soldier who has lost everything and everyone. Which would be quite common for many germans , and other europeons as well in those days.  Something we spoiled people of this century often don't try to grasp, destruction isn't a video game it has real consequencs.
