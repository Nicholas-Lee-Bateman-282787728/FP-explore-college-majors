The following is from the Warner Home Video press release:The Frank Sinatra & Gene Kelly Collection features:On the Town (1949) - Three sailors on leave in New York City have just 24 hours to take in the sights and find romance. The first musical to shoot on location, this was directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donan.Take Me Out To The Ballgame (1949) - Sinatra and Kelly work in vaudeville in the winter and play baseball for The Wolves in the summer. A new team manager (Esther Williams) comes along and has opposite effects on the guys. Betty Garrett supplies additional comic relief.Anchors Aweigh (1945) - A kind of dry run for ""On the Town"", this time sailors Sinatra and Kelly are on leave in Los Angeles, which draws their adventures into the realm of Hollywood. The plot is just a little too cute, which was a problem with MGM musicals starting around this time.Special features include interviews with William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, outtakes, and ""When the Lion Roars"" MGM documentary.On The Town is already on DVD and in the Gene Kelly DVD Collection. The other two films were put out on DVD in 2000, thus none of these films is new to DVD.",5,Set of musicals featuring Frank Sinatra & Gene Kelly,1202601600,"02 10, 2008",2008,1291,"['Warner', 'releasing', 'several', 'DVD', 'sets', 'featuring', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'same', 'day', 'set', 'films', 'starring', 'Sinatra', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'following', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'press', 'release', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Collection', 'features', 'Town', '1949', 'Three', 'sailors', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'have', 'just', '24', 'hours', 'take', 'sights', 'find', 'romance', 'first', 'musical', 'shoot', 'location', 'was', 'directed', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Stanley', 'Donan.Take', 'Me', 'Out', 'Ballgame', '1949', 'Sinatra', 'Kelly', 'work', 'vaudeville', 'winter', 'play', 'baseball', 'Wolves', 'summer', 'new', 'team', 'manager', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'along', 'opposite', 'effects', 'guys', 'Betty', 'Garrett', 'additional', 'comic', 'relief.Anchors', 'Aweigh', '1945', 'kind', 'dry', 'run', 'Town', 'time', 'sailors', 'Sinatra', 'Kelly', 'are', 'leave', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'draws', 'adventures', 'realm', 'Hollywood', 'plot', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'cute', 'was', 'problem', 'MGM', 'musicals', 'starting', 'time.Special', 'features', 'include', 'interviews', 'William', 'Hanna', 'Joseph', 'Barbera', 'outtakes', 'When', 'Lion', 'Roars', 'MGM', 'documentary.On', 'Town', 'already', 'DVD', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'DVD', 'Collection', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', '2000', 'thus', 'none', 'films', 'new', 'DVD']",The Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly Collection: (On the Town / Anchors Aweigh / Take Me out to the Ball Game)

1143498,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B0013LL2XE,Chrijeff,"[1, 1]","Though Sinatra gets first billing on the box, Kelly has at least as much to do with the success of the three movies as does Young Blue Eyes (as he was then).  ""Anchors Aweigh,"" released while World War II was still raging, finds the pair playing sailor buddies, the smooth-talking and worldly-wise Joe Brady (Kelly) and the shy, naive Clarence ""Brooklyn"" Doolittle (Sinatra), who, having just been decorated, are given four days' leave in Los Angeles.  Joe plans to look up a girl he knows, and Clarence asks to tag along in hopes of picking up some pointers, but then they get involved with an eight-year-old orphan boy, Donald Martin (Dean Stockwell), who has decided he wants to join the Navy (his father was in it) and won't tell the police his name and address.  This in turn gets them acquainted with Donald's pretty aunt and guardian, aspiring singer Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson), and Clarence rashly promises her an audition with bandleader Jose Iturbi.  Of course he can't deliver, and meanwhile Joe is falling for her and feels like a heel because he thinks Clarence is in love with her himself.  This dance-filled classic has the distinction of having furnished no less than three clips for the ""That's Entertainment!"" compilations: Sinatra and Kelly's number in the servicemen's hospitality dorm, Kelly's dance with the animated Jerry the Mouse, and his ""Soundstage Fantasy"" with Grayson.Four years later, Kelly and Sinatra teamed again, not once, but twice, and both times with Jules Munshin.  In ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game,"" for which Kelly provided the story, they're teammates on the champion Wolves around 1904: Sinatra is second baseman Dennis Ryan, Kelly is shortstop Eddie O'Brien, and Munshin is Nat Goldberg.  During the baseball season the trio make up the unstoppable team of ""O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg,"" which has put out every batter they've faced; during the winter O'Brien & Ryan, so billed, are song-and-dance men on the vaudeville circuit.  When the team is inherited by one K. C. Higgins (who turns out to be Kathryn Catherine Higgins (Esther Williams), and a true ball fan), Ryan falls hard, but O'Brien has his own ideas about how an owner should behave.  What's worse, an unsavory gambler (Edward Arnold) means to put the Wolves out of the running for the Series, and he has a plan to do it by appealing to Eddie's dreams of stage stardom.""On the Town"" finds the threesome once again playing gobs, this time loose in New York on a 24-hour liberty (Kelly co-directed).  Gabe (Kelly), Chip (Sinatra), and Ozzie (Munshin) are just looking for fun, but first Ozzie finds himself claimed by Claire Huddeson (Ann Miller), an anthropology fan who thinks he's a ringer for Pithecanthropus Erectus; then Chip gets entangled with aggressive lady cabdriver Brunnhilde Eszterhazy (Betty Garrett); and meanwhile Gabe has fallen--with a crash--for Miss Turnstiles, Ivy Smith (Vera-Ellen), who's not only a wannabe dancer but turns out to have come from the same Midwestern town as himself.  This was the first musical to be extensively filmed on location rather than a back lot; the ""New York, New York"" number is full of shots of famous sights.Both stars have a quiet charm that adds immeasurably to the success of the films,and Sinatra, though in his 30's when they were made, is a convincing naif in all of them.  He's also surprisingly light on his feet, though of course Kelly is better.  Though perhaps not among the best-known examples of MGM's large crop of musicals, these are still highly enjoyable and well worth your time, especially if you're a fan of Kelly's lively, athletic style.",4,Three lively musicals,1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,3623,"['Sinatra', 'first', 'billing', 'box', 'Kelly', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'success', 'three', 'movies', 'Young', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'was', 'then', 'Anchors', 'Aweigh', 'released', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'still', 'raging', 'pair', 'playing', 'sailor', 'buddies', 'smooth-talking', 'worldly-wise', 'Joe', 'Brady', 'Kelly', 'shy', 'naive', 'Clarence', 'Brooklyn', 'Doolittle', 'Sinatra', 'who', 'having', 'just', 'been', 'decorated', 'are', 'given', 'four', 'days', 'leave', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Joe', 'look', 'up', 'girl', 'Clarence', 'tag', 'along', 'hopes', 'picking', 'up', 'pointers', 'then', 'get', 'involved', 'eight-year-old', 'orphan', 'boy', 'Donald', 'Martin', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'who', 'decided', 'join', 'Navy', 'father', 'was', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'police', 'name', 'address', 'turn', 'acquainted', 'Donald', 'pretty', 'aunt', 'guardian', 'aspiring', 'singer', 'Susan', 'Abbott', 'Kathryn', 'Grayson', 'Clarence', 'rashly', 'audition', 'bandleader', 'Jose', 'Iturbi', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'meanwhile', 'Joe', 'falling', 'feels', 'heel', 'Clarence', 'love', 'dance-filled', 'classic', 'distinction', 'having', 'furnished', 'less', 'three', 'clips', 'Entertainment', 'compilations', 'Sinatra', 'Kelly', 'number', 'servicemen', 'hospitality', 'dorm', 'Kelly', 'dance', 'animated', 'Jerry', 'Mouse', 'Soundstage', 'Fantasy', 'Grayson.Four', 'years', 'later', 'Kelly', 'Sinatra', 'teamed', 'again', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'times', 'Jules', 'Munshin', 'Take', 'Me', 'Out', 'Ball', 'Game', 'Kelly', 'provided', 'story', ""'re"", 'teammates', 'champion', '1904', 'Sinatra', 'second', 'baseman', 'Dennis', 'Ryan', 'Kelly', 'shortstop', 'Eddie', ""O'Brien"", 'Munshin', 'Nat', 'Goldberg', 'baseball', 'season', 'trio', 'make', 'up', 'unstoppable', 'team', ""O'Brien"", 'Ryan', 'Goldberg', 'put', 'out', 'batter', ""'ve"", 'faced', 'winter', ""O'Brien"", 'Ryan', 'so', 'billed', 'are', 'song-and-dance', 'men', 'vaudeville', 'circuit', 'When', 'team', 'inherited', 'one', 'K.', 'C.', 'Higgins', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Kathryn', 'Catherine', 'Higgins', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'true', 'ball', 'fan', 'Ryan', 'hard', ""O'Brien"", 'own', 'ideas', 'how', 'owner', 'should', 'behave', 'What', 'worse', 'unsavory', 'gambler', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'put', 'Wolves', 'running', 'Series', 'plan', 'do', 'appealing', 'Eddie', 'dreams', 'stage', 'stardom', 'Town', 'threesome', 'once', 'again', 'playing', 'gobs', 'time', 'loose', 'New', 'York', '24-hour', 'liberty', 'Kelly', 'co-directed', 'Gabe', 'Kelly', 'Chip', 'Sinatra', 'Ozzie', 'Munshin', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'fun', 'first', 'Ozzie', 'claimed', 'Claire', 'Huddeson', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'anthropology', 'fan', 'who', 'ringer', 'Pithecanthropus', 'Erectus', 'then', 'Chip', 'entangled', 'aggressive', 'lady', 'cabdriver', 'Brunnhilde', 'Eszterhazy', 'Betty', 'Garrett', 'meanwhile', 'Gabe', 'fallen', 'crash', 'Miss', 'Turnstiles', 'Ivy', 'Smith', 'Vera-Ellen', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'wannabe', 'dancer', 'out', 'have', 'come', 'same', 'Midwestern', 'town', 'was', 'first', 'musical', 'be', 'extensively', 'filmed', 'location', 'rather', 'back', 'lot', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'number', 'full', 'shots', 'famous', 'sights.Both', 'stars', 'have', 'quiet', 'charm', 'immeasurably', 'success', 'films', 'Sinatra', '30', 'when', 'were', 'made', 'convincing', 'naif', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'light', 'feet', 'course', 'Kelly', 'better', 'perhaps', 'not', 'best-known', 'examples', 'MGM', 'large', 'crop', 'musicals', 'are', 'still', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'time', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Kelly', 'lively', 'athletic', 'style']",The Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly Collection: (On the Town / Anchors Aweigh / Take Me out to the Ball Game)

These three films are all big colorful MGM musicals, but none are in Widescreen because that particular aspect:ratio was not ""invented"" until 1954.  However, they LOOK spectacular anyway!""Anchors Aweigh"" (1945) is a winning musical about two sailors on shore leave in search of a ""dame"".  This musical's only flaw is it is a bit too long, as it has everything but the kitchen sink thrown in it, including a whole lot (too much) of Jose Iturbi, who must have been ""quite something"" in 1945 (but not now)!  However, it is thoroughly entertaining for both adults and children, the latter, due to a lengthy sequence in the middle of the film that pairs live action (Gene Kelly dancing) with animation.  Note, this was over 40 years BEFORE ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and 20 years before ""Mary Poppins"".Both Sinatra and Kelly are excellent and Sinatra proves he can DANCE with the greatest of them! (4 1/2 out of 5 stars)""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" (1949) is not quite as entertaining as ""Anchors Aweigh"".  It less colorful and has a weaker plot, but the songs and dancing are still top-notch!  This is the film where Sinatra REALLY proves he can DANCE as he and Kelly charge through a song in striped suits halfway through the film.  Songs like ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"", ""Strictly USA"", ""The Right Girl For Me"", and ""O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg"" add to the fun of this film. (3 1/2 out of 5 stars)""On the Town"" (1949)  Simply, one of the greatest musicals ever made!  This was the FIRST musical in film history to be filmed ON LOCATION, and what a location: NEW YORK CITY CIRCA 1949!  If the plot sounds familiar (THREE sailors on shore leave in search of a ""dame""), the musical numbers and the thrill of the Big Apple send this one right OUT of the ballpark!Co-starring Jules Munshin, Vera-Ellen, Betty Garrett, and Ann Miller, with some of the musical sequences composed by Leonard Bernstein, and the great theme song, ""New York, New York"" (""a helluva town, the Bronx is Up and the Battery Down..."", not the Sinatra smash-hit song, which came way later - 1979), ""On the Town"" is everything a musical could and should be!(5 out of 5 stars)Overall rating for this DVD box set, due to the considerable strengths of ""Anchors Aweigh"" and ""On the Town"": 5 out of 5 stars!",5,Sinatra & Kelly Dance Their Way Thru Top-Notch Musicals!,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,2434,"['three', 'DVDs', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'previously', 'however', 'new', 'boxed', 'set', 'houses', 'few', 'new', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'extras', 'be', 'found', 'Special', 'Features', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'big', 'colorful', 'MGM', 'musicals', 'none', 'are', 'Widescreen', 'particular', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'was', 'not', 'invented', '1954', 'However', 'LOOK', 'spectacular', 'anyway', 'Anchors', 'Aweigh', '1945', 'winning', 'musical', 'two', 'sailors', 'shore', 'leave', 'search', 'dame', 'musical', 'only', 'flaw', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'thrown', 'including', 'whole', 'lot', 'too', 'much', 'Jose', 'Iturbi', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'something', '1945', 'not', 'now', 'However', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'children', 'latter', 'due', 'lengthy', 'sequence', 'middle', 'film', 'live', 'action', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'dancing', 'animation', 'Note', 'was', '40', 'years', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', '20', 'years', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Sinatra', 'Kelly', 'are', 'excellent', 'Sinatra', 'can', 'DANCE', 'greatest', '4', '1/2', '5', 'stars', 'Take', 'Me', 'Out', 'Ballgame', '1949', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'entertaining', 'Anchors', 'Aweigh', 'less', 'colorful', 'weaker', 'plot', 'songs', 'dancing', 'are', 'still', 'top-notch', 'film', 'where', 'Sinatra', 'REALLY', 'can', 'DANCE', 'Kelly', 'charge', 'song', 'striped', 'suits', 'halfway', 'film', 'Songs', 'Take', 'Me', 'Out', 'Ballgame', 'Strictly', 'USA', 'Right', 'Girl', 'Me', ""O'Brien"", 'Ryan', 'Goldberg', 'add', 'fun', 'film', '3', '1/2', '5', 'stars', 'Town', '1949', 'Simply', 'one', 'greatest', 'musicals', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'FIRST', 'musical', 'film', 'history', 'be', 'filmed', 'ON', 'LOCATION', 'what', 'location', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'CITY', 'CIRCA', '1949', 'plot', 'familiar', 'THREE', 'sailors', 'shore', 'leave', 'search', 'dame', 'musical', 'numbers', 'thrill', 'Big', 'Apple', 'send', 'one', 'right', 'OUT', 'ballpark', 'Co-starring', 'Jules', 'Munshin', 'Vera-Ellen', 'Betty', 'Garrett', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'musical', 'sequences', 'composed', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'great', 'theme', 'song', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'helluva', 'town', 'Bronx', 'Up', 'Battery', 'Down', 'not', 'Sinatra', 'smash-hit', 'song', 'came', 'way', 'later', '1979', 'Town', 'everything', 'musical', 'could', 'should', 'be', '5', '5', 'stars', 'Overall', 'rating', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'due', 'considerable', 'strengths', 'Anchors', 'Aweigh', 'Town', '5', '5', 'stars']",The Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly Collection: (On the Town / Anchors Aweigh / Take Me out to the Ball Game)

You can feel the chemistry and see the genuine respect they had for each other. They also seemed to bring each up in their weaker areas. Gene never liked his voice, but his sweet Irish tenor fit in fine most of the time. Frank once said that he would have been a nobody in the movies if Gene hadn't taught him how to dance. (His dancing improved considerably with each of these movies.)Although he was billed third (huh?) ""Anchors Aweigh"" was Gene's film (he had the Oscar nomination to prove it.) There's lots for the Gene fan to enjoy here: the sexy phone call to Lola, Gene ""playing"" piano during ""If You Knew Susie,"" the Jerry dance, the glorious two minutes we get to see what those dancer's legs really looked like. But the coolest part is the fantasy on the movie set, where he brandishes a sword, leaps atop a castle and swings across it on a curtain, slides down a fireman's pole, and oh yeah, tap dances a tango. This is my favorite solo dance of his (second overall only to the ""An American In Paris"" ballet.) Frank's ""I Fall In Love Too Easily"" will put a lump in your throat. I have this one on VHS as well, and darn near wore it out trying to get to the good stuff.""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" is certainly the weakest of the bunch, but it's entertaining nevertheless. ""O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg"" will make you smile. Watch Gene as he leapfrogs up to the balcony to woo Esther Williams. At first ""The Hat My Father Wore"" seems like just a nice tip of the hat to Gene's Irish heritage. Be sure to watch the end, but do not, I repeat, do NOT attempt this at home as Gene tap dances on one foot with his other leg in the air. This DVD has two nice deleted scenes: the ""Baby Doll"" dance with Gene and Esther, and Sinatra's ""Boys and Girls Like You and Me"" (supposedly the song was too slow.)What can be said about ""On the Town?"" It's a masterpiece for sure. Nobody really stands out because everyone is great in it. Its pace is frenetic for sure (especially compared to the somewhat draggy ""Anchors Aweigh."" I especially love the part where Frank throws his guidebook off the Empire State Building.There should have been several more collaborations, but sadly it wasn't to be.
