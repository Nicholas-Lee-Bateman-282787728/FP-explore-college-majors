The Kennedys were meticulous when it came to recording their families - from the time the Kennedy clan were children and as they were growing this is a marvelous walk through their history.  I bought one for myself and another for a gift.

1452785,ARXYVR1TPTY6P,B005BTKNCU,"TJ-STL ""DVD viewer""","[6, 9]","THE LOST KENNEDY HOME MOVIES -This collection of ""lost"" Kennedy home movies has merit AND entrtainment value.  I was in the Air Force when Kennedy was shot.  I quickly applied for a 3 day pass before the word got out...remembering what they did to us during the ""BAY of Pigs"" fiasco. I went home and cried for  3 days and came back to Chanute and cried some more.One of the MAJOR problems/questions I had concerned; ""where was Ted Kennedy"", why was he not the successor for young Joe Kennedy, why was he absent from the movies or way in back and why did they not talk about him. I also question the big ""skips"" the movie had. Like why did they dismiss young Joe by saying his plane blew up on his first mission...actual he had made several and some have made movies on just what he was doing. Why was Joe senior's vast fortune and empire glossed over with ""he mad a series of good investments""? What about his affiliation with mob bosses and moon shiners not mentioned? I guess to only show his good side. Some still feel the Gangster mentality ""that if you cross them"", as Joe did, they may or may not kill you until they have killed EVERONE that you love. Or like waiting till they reach a point of political power and then have Joe watch them die for what he may have done. I have more questions about this ""cute fluff"" movies but they belong in a different type of movie.Now I have to admit this was not a National Geographic Historical movie, but a great sit at home and have a quiet evening watching some of the home movies of a family of famous people. It is worth watching but buy the DVD called ""The Kennedy's"".  3  stars.",3,Not long on history but did highlight the home life of a ICON,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,1631,"['LOST', 'KENNEDY', 'HOME', 'MOVIES', '-This', 'collection', 'lost', 'Kennedy', 'home', 'movies', 'merit', 'AND', 'entrtainment', 'value', 'was', 'Air', 'Force', 'when', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'shot', 'quickly', 'applied', '3', 'day', 'pass', 'word', 'got', 'out', 'remembering', 'what', 'did', 'BAY', 'Pigs', 'fiasco', 'went', 'home', 'cried', '3', 'days', 'came', 'back', 'Chanute', 'cried', 'more.One', 'MAJOR', 'problems/questions', 'had', 'concerned', 'where', 'was', 'Ted', 'Kennedy', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'successor', 'young', 'Joe', 'Kennedy', 'why', 'was', 'absent', 'movies', 'way', 'back', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'talk', 'also', 'question', 'big', 'skips', 'movie', 'had', 'why', 'did', 'dismiss', 'young', 'Joe', 'saying', 'plane', 'blew', 'up', 'first', 'mission', 'actual', 'had', 'made', 'several', 'have', 'made', 'movies', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'Why', 'was', 'Joe', 'senior', 'vast', 'fortune', 'empire', 'glossed', 'mad', 'series', 'good', 'investments', 'What', 'affiliation', 'mob', 'bosses', 'moon', 'shiners', 'not', 'mentioned', 'guess', 'only', 'show', 'good', 'side', 'still', 'feel', 'Gangster', 'mentality', 'cross', 'Joe', 'did', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'kill', 'have', 'killed', 'EVERONE', 'love', 'waiting', 'till', 'reach', 'point', 'political', 'power', 'then', 'have', 'Joe', 'watch', 'die', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'have', 'more', 'questions', 'cute', 'fluff', 'movies', 'belong', 'different', 'type', 'movie.Now', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'not', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Historical', 'movie', 'great', 'sit', 'home', 'have', 'quiet', 'evening', 'watching', 'home', 'movies', 'family', 'famous', 'people', 'worth', 'watching', 'buy', 'DVD', 'called', 'Kennedy', '3', 'stars']",The Lost Kennedy Home Movies
