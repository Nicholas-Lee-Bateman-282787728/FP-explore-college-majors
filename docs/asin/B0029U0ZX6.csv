I actually watched it twice in one day.It is the story of a family who lived in the northern Alaska wilderness from 1960 to 1975(ish) - in the Brooks Mountain Range deep in the Arctic Circle, 250 miles from the nearest road and 70 miles from the nearest town. The film is comprised of home videos beautifully shot and narrated. It somehow conveys the experience of living in that glorious wild place, attuned and a part of nature; and of the inner transformation that gradually took place in them.It's a wonderful film, a real work of art.",5,Magnificent!,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,632,"['stumbled', 'instant', 'video', 'one', 'best', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'actually', 'watched', 'twice', 'one', 'day.It', 'story', 'family', 'who', 'lived', 'northern', 'Alaska', 'wilderness', '1960', '1975', 'ish', 'Brooks', 'Mountain', 'Range', 'deep', 'Arctic', 'Circle', '250', 'miles', 'nearest', 'road', '70', 'miles', 'nearest', 'town', 'film', 'comprised', 'home', 'videos', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'narrated', 'somehow', 'experience', 'living', 'glorious', 'wild', 'place', 'attuned', 'part', 'nature', 'inner', 'transformation', 'gradually', 'took', 'place', 'them.It', 'wonderful', 'film', 'real', 'work', 'art']",The Alaska Wilderness Adventure

It was more of a documentary than a film.  It also shows them killing and gutting animals but they are only doing it for their survival.,4,The film suffers from age at times,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,240,"['was', 'good', 'show', 'looked', 'pretty', 'scenery', 'had', 'brownish', 'tone', 'instead', 'color', 'was', 'more', 'documentary', 'film', 'also', 'killing', 'gutting', 'animals', 'are', 'only', 'doing', 'survival']",The Alaska Wilderness Adventure
