941756,A2RG50XSRZB1VC,B000BGH254,"Alex W. Palmer ""tran fan""","[6, 8]","Beast Machines is a Transformers series that takes up where the previous series, Beast Wars, left off. The Maximals come home after three years of fighting Megatron and the Predacons, hoping to relax with their own kind again---only to find the place is deserted (except for Vehicons, who promptly give chase to the Maximals), the power is off, and Megatron somehow is in control.BM isn't pure action-adventure like G1 and BW were. It still has those elements, but it's also more higher-plane, with Optimus being more soul-searching and thoughtful than before (sometimes to the chagrin of his teammates).Pretty much the only I didn't like was what was done with Rattrap. Watch the series and you'll know what I mean.If you like the Transformers universe and are open to original ideas within it, get this collection. Forewarned, though: Beast Machines is a direct sequel to Beast Wars, so it might be confusing to anyone who didn't watch it beforehand.

941758,AK2Y8FIPRHE1H,B000BGH254,Andrew Lee Whitworth,"[14, 20]","One of the things I liked about the original Transformers series was it's sense of progression. Time passed, characters grew and changed, some lived, some died. Something rare in cartoons at the time. Beast Machines, like Beast Wars before it continues this tradition. It's a direct sequel to Beast Wars, focusing on the same cast of characters, only this time in a completely different setting and facing new challenges. The surviving Maximals, led by Optimus Primal, have finally won the Beast Wars and captured the renegade, Megatron, but during the trip back from prehistoric Earth, an accident causes Megatron to be lost in the time portal. When the Maximals awaken, they find themselves back home on Cybertron, some of their number missing, mysteriously stripped of their Transmetal bodies AND their ability to transform.  What's worse, the planet is now devoid of life and under the control of Megatron and his mindless army of Vehicon drones. The Maximals are now fugitives and must seek out and master new 'technorganic' bodies in order to defeat Megatron once and for all. The animation in this series was vastly superior to Beast Wars and lacked the corny humor that was so prominant in that series. The story was dark with many twists and turns, and revisits not only story elements introduced on Beast Wars but many from the original Transformers series as well, gelling the three into a solid continuity. Character development is strong here, wheather it be Rat Trap dealing with his new, ""useless"" body, Silverbolt turning from chivalrous to brooding or the fate of a beloved character, all are handeled well. Is it better than the original Transformers or even Beast Wars? That's a matter of opinion.

There, they discover that the planet is without power. A race of drone machines, known as Vehicons, are on the lookout for them. Megatron is behind the loss of power and the Vehicons. He uses two re-wired Maximals to try & uncover the Key to Vector Sigma, the mega-computer that gave life to all robots, and destroy the Maximals by transforming organic matter into ""technomatter"". That's pretty much where this saga begins.It's clear, from the get-go, that this series is a bit different than Beast Wars. It's evident because it is serious and darker in its' tone, dealing with more mature subjects than the previous series. I must admit, even though I love Beast Wars, I love this show even more because of the fact that it is more serious and 'grownup' in its' nature. It's a different 'beast', pardon the pun, altogether but a very entertaining one.If you look at the animation in the series, you'll see that it has come a long way in this series since Beast Wars. I'm glad, too, as the previous series showed how its' CGI was still in its' infancy. Course, CGI has come a long way since this show aired as well..it's pretty clear if you watch the new Transformers show, Transformers Prime.I'm sure that everyone doesn't share my sentiment but Beast Machines is a show you'll either love or hate in the Transformers mythos.

I grew up with the cartoon show and loved it, so it's hard for any new TF show these days to compare with it since alot of them seem more anime and pokemonish these days.In my late teens when Beast wars came out i instantly hated it at first, thinking it was stupid about transforming animals etc.  But by season 3 when it started tying in more with Gen 1 i was hooked, grew fond of all the characters and had to watch Beast wars again from the beginning, and it turned into my 2nd fav TF show.Beast Machines continues the story of Beast wars on their homeworld, cybertron.  This seemed like it would be great at first, but this show lacks the great storytelling in Beast Wars, and the new characters are not narly as cool and forgettable.  Megs spends all his time in a cybertroian coocoon type thing sending 3 incomptenet generals (which all look like gobots) and their mindless drones. Optimus turns into a monk in this show, rattrap is utterly destroyed cosmeticaly and looks like a happy meals TF. Cheetor has a major attitude and behaves liek an annoying rebellious teen, Nightscream is a joke, welll you get the point.  There are some good episodes scattered throughout the series, but most of the time the maximals are just running down alleyways or tunnels fleeing vehicons. And the whole concept about cybertron once being organic and the maximals trying to restore nature to cybertron to turn it into a planet like earth was retarded beyond belief, so i consider this TF story a tale of an alternate universe and not my beloved cybertron from 1984.  AAnyway if you're a TF fan its worth owning. I know it sounds like i have ragged on it the whole time, but it has its moments here and there.

Great show, passable animation.  I dug on how the G1 characters were still referenced, making the show canon with what I was familiar with.  Then I saw Beast Machines!  This is what I had been waiting on; a well written plot driven story line.  Having a cherished character (Rhinox) become a bad guy, brilliant!  The really sinister manipulation of our heroes.  Stunning animation.  My biggest problem was that I wanted more.  The current crop of Transformers shows are simply painful to watch.

I grew up with those old cartoons, characters like the original Optimus Prime and Megatron and still watch the episodes on DVD today.Anyway, just saying that since we grew up with the original and wouldn't like anything else really isn't fair.  Now granted, I haven't been a big fan of what I have seen from Robots in Disguise, Armada and Energon, although I have not watched the new Cybertron show as of yet.The biggest reason I don't like most of those shows can be split into 2 parts.#1 - I'm not a big fan of Pokemon style anime.  When I see a human being in a cartoon for example, I don't like seeing huge bug eyes and big spikey hair.  It's not limited to Transformers, I can't watch 90% of the shows on Cartoon network for that reason.#2 - I like some sort of contuinity.  Each show will have its own take on things, but watching some of these new shows is rather confusing.  Okay, so Optimus Prime is a big red truck and he's the leader of the Autobots...but wait, he isn't your Optimus Prime, no this one is kinda like him but different, he's from an alternate universe and Ironhide, Prowl, Perceptor, Jetfire, Starscream, Thundercracker, Skywarp...those aren't the same ones either.  But there is a Cybertron, a Unicron, Decepticons, Quinetssons...but different ones.  Huh?Having said all that, I was a real big fan of the Beast Wars series.  They had some of the best storylines for any kind of show, period.  They did an excellent job of creating the characters and evovling the story.  They also tied the show directly to the original Transformers line in realistic ways that didn't damage the previous legacy and/or inhibit the Beast Wars one.  I know some people didn't like the 3-D animation and it was a stretch at first for me, also.  However, after you sit through 2-3 shows it seems very natural.Having said that, the Beast Machines series just doesn't quite measure up.  The writing is inferior in my opinion and the characters do a lot of things that don't make sense, especially the ones carried over from the Beast Wars shows.  I remember watching it and thinking it was written by a doped up enviromentalist hippie but that's just my personal take.However, if you want my opinion on which series to pick up other than the originals, definitely give Beast Wars a try before you buy this one.",3,"I liked Beast Wars, BUT...",1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,2419,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'am', 'one', 'G1', 'Sunbow', 'Transfans', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mention', 'grew', 'up', 'old', 'cartoons', 'characters', 'original', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'Megatron', 'still', 'watch', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'today.Anyway', 'just', 'saying', 'grew', 'up', 'original', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'anything', 'else', 'really', ""n't"", 'fair', 'Now', 'granted', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'Robots', 'Disguise', 'Armada', 'Energon', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'new', 'Cybertron', 'show', 'yet.The', 'biggest', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'most', 'shows', 'can', 'be', 'split', '2', 'parts.', '1', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Pokemon', 'style', 'anime', 'When', 'see', 'human', 'being', 'cartoon', 'example', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'huge', 'bug', 'eyes', 'big', 'spikey', 'hair', 'not', 'limited', 'Transformers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', '90', '%', 'shows', 'Cartoon', 'network', 'reason.', '2', 'like', 'sort', 'contuinity', 'show', 'will', 'have', 'own', 'take', 'things', 'watching', 'new', 'shows', 'rather', 'confusing', 'Okay', 'so', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'big', 'red', 'truck', 'leader', 'Autobots', 'wait', ""n't"", 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'one', 'kinda', 'different', 'alternate', 'universe', 'Ironhide', 'Prowl', 'Perceptor', 'Jetfire', 'Starscream', 'Thundercracker', 'Skywarp', 'are', ""n't"", 'same', 'ones', 'either', 'Cybertron', 'Unicron', 'Decepticons', 'Quinetssons', 'different', 'ones', 'Huh', 'Having', 'said', 'was', 'real', 'big', 'fan', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'series', 'had', 'best', 'storylines', 'kind', 'show', 'period', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'creating', 'characters', 'evovling', 'story', 'also', 'tied', 'show', 'directly', 'original', 'Transformers', 'line', 'realistic', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'damage', 'previous', 'legacy', 'and/or', 'inhibit', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'one', 'know', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", '3-D', 'animation', 'was', 'stretch', 'first', 'also', 'However', 'sit', '2-3', 'shows', 'very', 'natural.Having', 'said', 'Beast', 'Machines', 'series', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'writing', 'inferior', 'opinion', 'characters', 'do', 'lot', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'especially', 'ones', 'carried', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'remember', 'watching', 'thinking', 'was', 'written', 'doped', 'up', 'enviromentalist', 'hippie', 'just', 'personal', 'take.However', 'want', 'opinion', 'series', 'pick', 'up', 'other', 'originals', 'definitely', 'give', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'try', 'buy', 'one']",Transformers Beast Machines - The Complete Series

941772,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000BGH254,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 2]","Beast Wars was enough of a departure from the Transformers mythology, but the show proved to be something special indeed.  Beast Machines picks up where Beast Wars left off, and things take even more of a turn with this series.  Beast Machines picks up with Maximals Optimus Primal, Cheetor, Rattrap, and Black Arachnia on Cybertron and trapped in their original beast forms.  Silverbolt and Rhinox are missing, and none of them have any memory of what happened.  Things are complicated even more so by the fact that they are being hunted by the drone-like Vehicons, who are controlled by Megatron.  As the series develops throughout it's two seasons (both of which are collected here) the Maximals slowly learn the truth behind their comrade's disappearances and what Megatron is planning, while gaining new attack modes, finding new allies, and learning the truth behind Cybertron's history as the barrier between the organic and the mechanical begins to break.  Unlike on Beast Wars, the Maximals don't transform, instead they ""morph"" into their robot modes.  This alone is one of the reasons that Beast Machines never attained the greatness that Beast Wars achieved, along with the convoluted, and a bit confusing, storyline, and the whole ""organic VS mechanical"" storyline just really didn't fit here.  Not to mention that the new robot forms of many of the Maximals (Rattrap comes to mind) just come off as lame.  Still, there's plenty of great twists and turns, spectacularly animated battle sequences, and a downbeat, shocker of an ending to the series that may come as a surprise to longtime viewers of the Beast Wars/Machines saga.  All in all, while Beast Machines never reached what Beast Wars managed to achieve, it's still a more than worthy addition to the Transformers mythos, and needless to say, if you loved Beast Wars, you should give Beast Machines a chance just to see how it all comes to an end.",4,"It isn't Beast Wars, get over it",1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,1918,"['Beast', 'Wars', 'was', 'enough', 'departure', 'Transformers', 'mythology', 'show', 'proved', 'be', 'something', 'special', 'indeed', 'Beast', 'Machines', 'up', 'where', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'left', 'off', 'things', 'take', 'even', 'more', 'turn', 'series', 'Beast', 'Machines', 'up', 'Maximals', 'Optimus', 'Primal', 'Cheetor', 'Rattrap', 'Black', 'Arachnia', 'Cybertron', 'trapped', 'original', 'beast', 'forms', 'Silverbolt', 'Rhinox', 'are', 'missing', 'none', 'have', 'memory', 'what', 'happened', 'Things', 'are', 'complicated', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'fact', 'are', 'being', 'hunted', 'drone-like', 'Vehicons', 'who', 'are', 'controlled', 'Megatron', 'series', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'collected', 'here', 'Maximals', 'slowly', 'learn', 'truth', 'comrade', 'disappearances', 'what', 'Megatron', 'planning', 'gaining', 'new', 'attack', 'modes', 'finding', 'new', 'allies', 'learning', 'truth', 'Cybertron', 'history', 'barrier', 'organic', 'mechanical', 'begins', 'break', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'Maximals', 'do', ""n't"", 'transform', 'instead', 'morph', 'robot', 'modes', 'alone', 'one', 'reasons', 'Beast', 'Machines', 'never', 'attained', 'greatness', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'achieved', 'convoluted', 'bit', 'confusing', 'storyline', 'whole', 'organic', 'VS', 'mechanical', 'storyline', 'just', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'here', 'Not', 'mention', 'new', 'robot', 'forms', 'many', 'Maximals', 'Rattrap', 'mind', 'just', 'come', 'off', 'lame', 'Still', 'plenty', 'great', 'twists', 'turns', 'spectacularly', 'animated', 'battle', 'sequences', 'downbeat', 'shocker', 'ending', 'series', 'may', 'come', 'surprise', 'longtime', 'viewers', 'Beast', 'Wars/Machines', 'saga', 'Beast', 'Machines', 'never', 'reached', 'what', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'managed', 'achieve', 'still', 'more', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Transformers', 'mythos', 'needless', 'say', 'loved', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'should', 'give', 'Beast', 'Machines', 'chance', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'end']",Transformers Beast Machines - The Complete Series

The reason for this is basically new writers.  I dont think the new writers grasped the concept of beast wars.  Cheetor is suppose to be a support character, not a stuck up leader.  And Rattrap took a complete 180 turn in character.  Rattrap is suppose to be one of the pride driven maximals, never turning his back on his friends, but he did in one of the episodes in beast machines.  Even though Beast Machines failed with Cheetor and Rattrap, it did great with the other characters.  I particularly loved the way they took silverbolt's character.  He became a true hero.  Optimus stayed the same as beast wars pretty much as did megatron.  Blackarachnia's character I never really liked much.  The addition of botana and nightscream were great.  The biggest mistake they made was switching Rhinox into an evil vehicon.  Rhinox was the backbone of the maximal team, probably the most loyal character, switching him and ultimatly killing him was a bad move.

The Maximals are back on Cybertron, they're trapped in beast mode, can't transform and there are tons of robot tanks, bikes and jets after them! They don't know what's going on, how they got there or where their friends are, they just know they have to survive. But Optimus is receiving strange messages from ""The Oracle"", and after they find it, they find out Megatron has taken over Cyberton and killed every transformer there ever was! Now, reformatted by the Oracle, the Maximals need to adapt to their new biomechanic bodies, learn to transform and try to stop Megatron before he absorbs the sparks of all cybertronians!This series takes some getting used to. You obviously go in expecting more Beast Wars, and that's not exactly what you get. The characters have evolved. Optimus is like a sensei, Cheetor has matured, Black Arachnia is all Maximal, but misses Silverbolt. The biggest changes were inflicted in Ratrap and Rhinox, though. I won't say what happened to Rhinox, it's a huge spoiler to those who haven't seen the series. But I was initially incredibly disappoited with Ratrap, and that's what made me turn away from this at first. His design was radically changed, and they messed with this character to a point where, in an episode, he betrays his friends. After I got kinda used to his new looks, I gave the show another chance, and was not disappointed.Would more Beast Wars have been better? Sure!

941776,AX9ZYSNJKJJK6,B000BGH254,R. Wolfe,"[9, 13]","This show was an absolute slap in the face to fans of Beast Wars.  Of course, not a few people thought Beast Wars was the same to fans of the original Transformers, but that's for another review.  If you have invested in the amazing Beast Wars DVDs, you were left wanting even more--they were just that good.  This is not what you want.  Mainframe's different animation style, lacking reflective metals, was the first slap.  A complete discontinuity with the excellent Transmetals story line, including breaks from character despite the use of the same voice actors, was next.  Dragging out a ""mystery"" across two short (13 episode) seasons whose resolution was the all-time ultimate slap in the face of robot-lovers everywhere (including those who like them in animal form) was the last.  Throw in the fact that you have a show about robots who shoot bullets and missiles at their enemies all day long but have--wait for it--NO bullets or missiles, and why would you watch this show at all?  Now, that all stated, if you have no allegiance to Beast Wars (or G1 Transformers, for that matter), then this might be for you.  The animation was terrific, very much the same as everything from Mainframe at the time (think Action Man, Cubix, etc.).  There are a lot of robots that are pretty cool.  Tankorr was really awesome looking.  Looking.  (Terrible character whose secret was nothing short of utter disappointment for a Beast Wars fan, ruining a fan-favorite character and all as it did. )  There are redeeming storylines for some of the characters.

941779,A1GS0PH41JDVZP,B000BGH254,Stephen Breuer,"[8, 11]","This show continues relatively soon after Beast Wars and contained all the surviving characters from the previous show. There are a few reasons it doesn't get five stars. The first being that it was aired on FOX. FOX had several rules for it's 'kids' shows, they didn't allow projectile weapons or characters losing limbs or being decapitated. Beast Wars was sold right into syndication so it was able to do things like that. Another thing that was not allowed was deaths, including heroic deaths, Beast Wars had both of these. Now as for the animation I can see why some people didn't like it. I wasn't that fond of it myself, but it is good. The transformation sequences were very different, it seemed like they morphed rather than transformed. One thing I really didn't like was the directions that they took some of the characters. Cheetor became the second in command and Rattrap, one of my favorite characters from Beast Wars, became a bumbling idiot. Also this show contained politically correct elements (technology vs Nature). Also, at times it seemed to borrow very heavily from ""The Terminator"" and ""The Matrix"". Aside from that it introduced some engaging storylines. It isn't really a self-contained show, to properly enjoy it you might want to watch Beast Wars, some of the episodes contain very detailed references and flash-backs to Beast Wars, and sometimes even Generation 1 Transformers. The new characters introduced range from OK to really good. The plot-lines were very deep and emotional with what was occasionally intense material. I'm glad that I can own the whole show on one set. If you're just a casual fan then I doubt this would be for you, but for those who enjoyed Transformers and Beast Wars and want to see their continued adventures then here it is.",4,Not as good as Beast Wars but still good.,1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,1784,"['show', 'relatively', 'soon', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'contained', 'surviving', 'characters', 'previous', 'show', 'are', 'few', 'reasons', ""n't"", 'get', 'five', 'stars', 'first', 'being', 'was', 'aired', 'FOX', 'FOX', 'had', 'several', 'rules', ""'kids"", 'shows', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'projectile', 'weapons', 'characters', 'losing', 'limbs', 'being', 'decapitated', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'was', 'sold', 'right', 'syndication', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'things', 'thing', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'was', 'deaths', 'including', 'heroic', 'deaths', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'had', 'Now', 'animation', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', ""n't"", 'fond', 'good', 'transformation', 'sequences', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'seemed', 'morphed', 'rather', 'transformed', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'directions', 'took', 'characters', 'Cheetor', 'became', 'second', 'command', 'Rattrap', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'became', 'bumbling', 'idiot', 'Also', 'show', 'contained', 'politically', 'correct', 'elements', 'technology', 'Nature', 'Also', 'times', 'seemed', 'borrow', 'very', 'heavily', 'Terminator', 'Matrix', 'Aside', 'introduced', 'engaging', 'storylines', ""n't"", 'really', 'self-contained', 'show', 'properly', 'enjoy', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'episodes', 'contain', 'very', 'detailed', 'references', 'flash-backs', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'sometimes', 'even', 'Generation', '1', 'Transformers', 'new', 'characters', 'introduced', 'range', 'OK', 'really', 'good', 'plot-lines', 'were', 'very', 'deep', 'emotional', 'what', 'was', 'occasionally', 'intense', 'material', ""'m"", 'glad', 'can', 'own', 'whole', 'show', 'one', 'set', ""'re"", 'just', 'casual', 'fan', 'then', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Transformers', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'want', 'see', 'continued', 'adventures', 'then', 'here']",Transformers Beast Machines - The Complete Series
941780,AWGPEXO9M8R7Q,B000BGH254,Stephen M. Sturgeon,"[6, 8]","I'm a Transformers fan going all the way back to the early 80's. I was also a fan so fanatical that I never even wanted to discuss Beast Wars while it was airing. I saw the whole notion of Beast Wars as an illegitimate child trying to barge in on the legacy of the one true Transformer series.Luckily a fellow fan changed my mind and I gave Beast Wars a chance when it came out on DVD. I loved it so much that I wanted more.I was hesitant to buy Beast Machines due to a lot of negative feedback it received from fans of the original series just like me. I heard it didn't follow cannon, animation was good but the story was terrible and everyone did things that were out of character. However, remembering how I originally felt about Beast Wars, I decided to get Machines regardless.I was not disappointed. It is close enough to the original cannon that as a fan of the 80's series, I can appreciate this as a continuation of what I'd come to love.  At the same time it's original enough that you don't really need to have seen what came before to enjoy this show. It helps to have seen previous shows. It makes the experience fuller, but it's hardly necessary.This is by far the darkest Transformer series out there. But it's also that darkness, that seriousness, which lends Beast Machines its credibility.Recent cartoon series I've seen, both Transformer and otherwise, are usually cookie cutter ""let's go out and beat the bad guy because we're the good guys and that's what we're supposed to do"" story lines. Here you know what the stakes are and you know it's serious.  It's a deepness of story telling that's missing in a lot of today's television.The only cringe I have with this series is the techno dance pop music that gets rather incessant throughout the series. Barring that, I'd have to place this as the last great Transformer series that was made.",5,Better than I hoped,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1862,"[""'m"", 'Transformers', 'fan', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'early', '80', 'was', 'also', 'fan', 'so', 'fanatical', 'never', 'even', 'wanted', 'discuss', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'was', 'airing', 'saw', 'whole', 'notion', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'illegitimate', 'child', 'trying', 'barge', 'legacy', 'one', 'true', 'Transformer', 'series.Luckily', 'fellow', 'fan', 'changed', 'mind', 'gave', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'chance', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'wanted', 'more.I', 'was', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'Beast', 'Machines', 'due', 'lot', 'negative', 'feedback', 'received', 'fans', 'original', 'series', 'just', 'heard', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'cannon', 'animation', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'terrible', 'everyone', 'did', 'things', 'were', 'character', 'However', 'remembering', 'how', 'originally', 'felt', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'decided', 'get', 'Machines', 'regardless.I', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'close', 'enough', 'original', 'cannon', 'fan', '80', 'series', 'can', 'appreciate', 'continuation', 'what', ""'d"", 'come', 'love', 'same', 'time', 'original', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'have', 'seen', 'came', 'enjoy', 'show', 'have', 'seen', 'previous', 'shows', 'experience', 'fuller', 'hardly', 'necessary.This', 'far', 'darkest', 'Transformer', 'series', 'there', 'also', 'darkness', 'seriousness', 'Beast', 'Machines', 'credibility.Recent', 'cartoon', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Transformer', 'otherwise', 'are', 'usually', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'let', 'go', 'out', 'beat', 'bad', 'guy', ""'re"", 'good', 'guys', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'do', 'story', 'lines', 'Here', 'know', 'what', 'stakes', 'are', 'know', 'serious', 'deepness', 'story', 'telling', 'missing', 'lot', 'today', 'television.The', 'only', 'cringe', 'have', 'series', 'techno', 'dance', 'pop', 'music', 'rather', 'incessant', 'series', 'Barring', ""'d"", 'have', 'place', 'last', 'great', 'Transformer', 'series', 'was', 'made']",Transformers Beast Machines - The Complete Series

I decided to buy this dvd because I already have all of G1 and Beast Wars, so I thought I'd complete the collection. Watching it again years later, I realized that BM is actually a really good and insightful show. True, it's much darker than G1 and beast Wars, but that's what gives it depth. None of the characters are perfect, but again their flaws make them worth watching. Cheetor, who I didn't care for at all in BW, has grown up to be a likable character and a decent second-in-command. I especially liked that Optimus was no longer the perfect leader and that while the other Maximals respected him, they thought for themselves.

Beast Wars was pretty big shoes to fill.  After years of no new transformers animation, Beast Wars came out of nowhere to be a bigger hit than anyone ever expected.  It was able to capture even the support of original Transformers fans by making a strong connection to that original series and even having a few G1 transformers show up.Beast machines is decidedly darker and grittier than Beast Wars.  Here the Maximals find themselves back on Cyberton (somehow) and further they are locked into their beastmodes, and also suffering amnesia.  To make matters worse they're pursued by an army of tank drones who attack relentlessly.  Thus would begin the running theme of the Maximals on the run and trying to find out what exactly happened to their homeworld.  Throughout they encounter old friends and enemies and old friends in new guises as they eventually learn to transform (or perhaps morph is the better word).I consider Beast Machines a very good entry in Transformers lore and continuity.  Yes some changes were made to character's personalities but it fit perfectly well with the whole plot of the new show.
