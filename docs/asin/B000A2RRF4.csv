918988,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000A2RRF4,Boss Fan,"[8, 8]","The 1992 HBO concert (and frequent subsequent VH1 staple) finally comes to DVD, available by itself for the first time (and just in the nick of time for those of us still viewing our 15 year-old VHS tapes, that probably have more glitches and grain on them than any self-respecting fan would ever deal with).  Time has not been too kind to this show (unlike the album the concert supports, which I hadn't come to truly appreciate until recent years - it, I think, was ahead of its time -  this show feel somewhat dated), but it still boasts a large number of standout performances and several of Jackson's awe-inspiring moves.  The setlist is great (though you almost wish there were more hits represented; however to fit all of MJ's hits in one show, the guy would have to be on stage for 5 hours), so is the dancing and the theatrics.  Less than stellar is the lip-synching on many songs (although given his huff-and-puff performance of ""Billie Jean,"" maybe lip-synching is necessary for some performers) and endless shots of crying, fainting fans (although, if you could make 20 people per show do that, I bet you'd make a point of showing it off on your DVD).This is the only Michael Jackson live DVD available.  Simply to have a document of why he is considered to be the ultimate performer is reason enough to say this is a must addition to any true rock `n roll library.  However, it is flawed in some respects and much of the shenanigans feel dated.  A too-bass-heavy sound mix doesn't help.  But Jackson's solo spotlight dance on ""Billie Jean"" (vocal performance aside) is reason all by itself to own this baby.  ""Smooth Criminal"" is also a performance highlight.If you plan to pick this one up, do yourself a favor and, instead of spending 15 to 20 bucks on this, pay up another 10 or 15 and grab ""The Ultimate"" box set from two years ago.  This DVD is included there along with four other CD's of Jackson hits, B-Sides, and Jackson 5/Jackson era jams.  It is simply the better buy, especially since it now sells for about $30 at Best Buy (last week they had it on sale for $20).I see people here at Amazon are fairly divided on this release, as they seem to be about Jackson himself.  However, most agree he is still a mesmerizing performer and just can't help but watch him perform.  If this DVD doesn't do it for you, then I recommend both ""Dangerous:  The Short Films"" (like the album, this DVD also feels ahead of its time in that it came out originally on VHS back in the early 90s when these type of releases were basically just a bunch of videos, this one has the videos built around all sorts of other stuff:  news footage, award appearances, and has videos you may have never scene on MTV; its like a scrapbook of everything he did during that album's reign - it should be required that any band and their producer watch this before just throwing together a bunch of videos for a DVD compilation) and ""HIStory on Film:  Volume II,"" which includes a lot of the best stuff that was already on  the first volume (""Thriller,"" ""Beat It,"" etc), but also all the great stuff they left off the first volume (like the full 40-minute ""Smooth Criminal"" video, the infamous ""Billie Jean"" Motown 25 performance, and newer stuff as recent as that DVDs release in 1997, like ""Blood on the Dance Floor,"" which i still say is a great, underrated Jackson track).",4,"Hasn't aged that well, and Sony did us no favors with a decent DVD transfer, still the man and his performance makes this a must",1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,3364,"['1992', 'HBO', 'concert', 'frequent', 'subsequent', 'VH1', 'staple', 'finally', 'DVD', 'available', 'first', 'time', 'just', 'nick', 'time', 'still', 'viewing', '15', 'year-old', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'probably', 'have', 'more', 'glitches', 'grain', 'self-respecting', 'fan', 'would', 'ever', 'deal', 'Time', 'not', 'been', 'too', 'kind', 'show', 'album', 'concert', 'supports', 'had', ""n't"", 'come', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'recent', 'years', 'think', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'show', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'still', 'large', 'number', 'standout', 'performances', 'several', 'Jackson', 'awe-inspiring', 'moves', 'setlist', 'great', 'almost', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'hits', 'represented', 'however', 'fit', 'MJ', 'hits', 'one', 'show', 'guy', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'stage', '5', 'hours', 'so', 'dancing', 'theatrics', 'Less', 'stellar', 'lip-synching', 'many', 'songs', 'given', 'huff-and-puff', 'performance', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'maybe', 'lip-synching', 'necessary', 'performers', 'endless', 'shots', 'crying', 'fainting', 'fans', 'could', 'make', '20', 'people', 'show', 'do', 'bet', ""'d"", 'make', 'point', 'showing', 'off', 'DVD', '.This', 'only', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'live', 'DVD', 'available', 'Simply', 'have', 'document', 'why', 'considered', 'be', 'ultimate', 'performer', 'reason', 'enough', 'say', 'must', 'addition', 'true', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'library', 'However', 'flawed', 'respects', 'much', 'shenanigans', 'feel', 'dated', 'too-bass-heavy', 'sound', 'mix', ""n't"", 'help', 'Jackson', 'solo', 'spotlight', 'dance', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'vocal', 'performance', 'aside', 'reason', 'own', 'baby', 'Smooth', 'Criminal', 'also', 'performance', 'highlight.If', 'plan', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'do', 'favor', 'instead', 'spending', '15', '20', 'bucks', 'pay', 'up', '10', '15', 'grab', 'Ultimate', 'box', 'set', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'DVD', 'included', 'there', 'along', 'four', 'other', 'CD', 'Jackson', 'hits', 'B-Sides', 'Jackson', '5/Jackson', 'era', 'jams', 'simply', 'better', 'buy', 'especially', 'now', '30', 'Best', 'Buy', 'last', 'week', 'had', 'sale', '20', '.I', 'see', 'people', 'here', 'Amazon', 'are', 'fairly', 'divided', 'release', 'seem', 'be', 'Jackson', 'However', 'most', 'agree', 'still', 'mesmerizing', 'performer', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'watch', 'perform', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'do', 'then', 'recommend', 'Dangerous', 'Short', 'Films', 'album', 'DVD', 'also', 'ahead', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'originally', 'VHS', 'back', 'early', '90s', 'when', 'type', 'releases', 'were', 'basically', 'just', 'bunch', 'videos', 'one', 'videos', 'built', 'sorts', 'other', 'stuff', 'news', 'footage', 'award', 'appearances', 'videos', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'scene', 'MTV', 'scrapbook', 'everything', 'did', 'album', 'reign', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'band', 'producer', 'watch', 'just', 'throwing', 'together', 'bunch', 'videos', 'DVD', 'compilation', 'HIStory', 'Film', 'Volume', 'II', 'lot', 'best', 'stuff', 'was', 'already', 'first', 'volume', 'Thriller', 'Beat', 'etc', 'also', 'great', 'stuff', 'left', 'off', 'first', 'volume', 'full', '40-minute', 'Smooth', 'Criminal', 'video', 'infamous', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'Motown', '25', 'performance', 'newer', 'stuff', 'as', 'recent', 'DVDs', 'release', '1997', 'Blood', 'Dance', 'Floor', 'i', 'still', 'say', 'great', 'underrated', 'Jackson', 'track']",Michael Jackson:  Live in Bucharest -The Dangerous Tour
918989,A1R3SN9A7EHSYD,B000A2RRF4,"Brandon A. Coles ""OmNyx""","[5, 5]","This program was recorded October 1, 1992 and became the stamp of approval solidifying the legendary status of the King of Pop. Michael Jackson's ""Live in Bucharest"" is a triumph. Watching this presentation literally pulls you into the screen. The stirring power of this personality oozes throughout the concert. One of the most memorable parts of the concert showcases Siedah Garrett (background singer and writer of ""Man In The Mirror"") sharing the stage with him on ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You."" This duet, as passionate as it was, transitions into ""She's Out Of My Life."" He calls a female audience member on stage and she's in awe of this mere mortal on stage to the point where she had to be carried off the stage by the event security. WOW! This stage technique has often been duplicated by the likes of Bobby Brown, Usher, Justin Timberlake and many artists after MJ blazed the trail for other known performers. Overall, The Dangerous Tour is Michael's finest performance since the Bad World Tour in 1987. The sound quality could have been better, but nothing can diminish the precision & timing of the dancers, the quality professionalism of the band and singers spearheaded by Greg Phillinganes & Brad Buxer on keys and the rhythms of the great Ricky Lawson. As a footnote, this was a pioneering concert in which the producers utilized on stage ProTools editing with added vocal & musical programming, a proponent that is widely used today in various live shows and stage presentations. (All hail Bruce Swedien!) I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this energetic masterpiece. Rest In Peace, MJJ! You were a supernova! A true gift and an icon to this society!

918991,A35ROK8CVWNF62,B000A2RRF4,"Buggy ""SUNNIE Day reader""","[1, 1]","I grew when Michael Jackson was the king of the world. He was everywhere and could do no wrong but I was never really a huge fan. After watching this amazing performance however I can now see why he is and always will be `the king of pop' No one can top him when it comes to putting on an incredible show. His expertise and stage presence is simply mesmerising and I must give him props. Plus watching the audience absolutely freak out here is pretty entertaining too.This concert takes place in Bucharest Romania during the Dangerous Tour and at the height of his popularity in 1992. And except for the cheesy clothing and hairstyles (particularly on the back up dancers) you can barely tell that this concert is now almost 20 years old. The dance moves and music still feel fresh and exciting. MJ performs most of his mainstream hits for the better part of 2 hours in such a way that this show feels like a combination of stage musical and rock concert. Complete with outtakes of music videos including McCauley Culkin and Black Panther, glow in the dark skeletons and coffins (Thriller) and absolutely astounding dance routines (of course.) The audience is insane and almost as much fun to watch as the show itself; screaming, crying, passing out and being taken out by security. At one point Jackson attempts to enter the audience and I was actually scared for him thinking they're going to tear him apart. Its amazing stuff, one forgets just how popular he was back in the day.My only gripe would be the sound. Michaels vocals sometimes fade in and out, usually at the beginning of a song even though the back-up singers and crowd always sound fine. There's also a considerable amount of lip-synching although that may have something to do with the werewolf costume or all the musical theatre going on. Other than that as a `non-fan' I can highly recommend watching this concert as you will definitely come away with an appreciation for this performer whether you like him or not. I'm just sorry now that I never got to see him live.Songs included; Main Title, Jam, Wanna be Startin Something, Human Nature, Smooth Criminal, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, She's Out Of My Life, I Want You Back/The Love Save, I'll Be There, Black Or White, Heal The World, and Man In The Mirror.",4,THIS IS GREAT,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,2282,"['grew', 'when', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', 'king', 'world', 'was', 'everywhere', 'could', 'do', 'wrong', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'huge', 'fan', 'watching', 'amazing', 'performance', 'however', 'can', 'now', 'see', 'why', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'king', 'pop', 'one', 'can', 'top', 'when', 'putting', 'incredible', 'show', 'expertise', 'stage', 'presence', 'simply', 'mesmerising', 'must', 'give', 'props', 'watching', 'audience', 'absolutely', 'out', 'here', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'too.This', 'concert', 'place', 'Bucharest', 'Romania', 'Dangerous', 'Tour', 'height', 'popularity', '1992', 'cheesy', 'clothing', 'hairstyles', 'particularly', 'back', 'dancers', 'can', 'barely', 'tell', 'concert', 'now', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'old', 'dance', 'moves', 'music', 'still', 'feel', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'MJ', 'most', 'mainstream', 'hits', 'better', 'part', '2', 'hours', 'such', 'way', 'show', 'combination', 'stage', 'musical', 'rock', 'concert', 'Complete', 'outtakes', 'music', 'videos', 'including', 'McCauley', 'Culkin', 'Black', 'Panther', 'glow', 'dark', 'skeletons', 'coffins', 'Thriller', 'absolutely', 'astounding', 'dance', 'routines', 'course', 'audience', 'insane', 'almost', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'show', 'screaming', 'crying', 'passing', 'out', 'being', 'taken', 'out', 'security', 'one', 'point', 'Jackson', 'enter', 'audience', 'was', 'actually', 'scared', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'going', 'tear', 'apart', 'amazing', 'stuff', 'one', 'just', 'how', 'popular', 'was', 'back', 'day.My', 'only', 'gripe', 'would', 'be', 'sound', 'Michaels', 'vocals', 'sometimes', 'fade', 'usually', 'beginning', 'song', 'even', 'back-up', 'singers', 'crowd', 'always', 'sound', 'fine', 'also', 'considerable', 'amount', 'lip-synching', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'werewolf', 'costume', 'musical', 'theatre', 'going', 'Other', 'non-fan', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'concert', 'will', 'definitely', 'come', 'away', 'appreciation', 'performer', 'like', 'not', ""'m"", 'just', 'sorry', 'now', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'live.Songs', 'included', 'Main', 'Title', 'Jam', 'Wan', 'na', 'be', 'Startin', 'Something', 'Human', 'Nature', 'Smooth', 'Criminal', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Loving', 'My', 'Life', 'Want', 'Back/The', 'Love', 'Save', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Black', 'Or', 'White', 'Heal', 'World', 'Man', 'Mirror']",Michael Jackson:  Live in Bucharest -The Dangerous Tour

Never, until now. I bought this DVD prompted by a death that caught me by surprise and saddened me very deeply. I had so much hoped Michael would make a comeback and show off his great talent to the whole world once again. When I realized this would never happen, I thought buying his DVDs was the best thing that was left for me to do. I started watching as soon as it arrived and I sat there, in front of the television, unable to move, trying not to miss the slightest detail, unwilling even to stretch out my arm to grab a glass of orange juice sitting on the table next to me. From beginning to end this concert is a stunner. Michael Jackson's phenomenal talent, charisma, charm, professionalism, elegance are right there for us to rejoice. I had seen Michael on other videos and he had always charmed me but this particular concert is so good that I cannot imagine anything better. Together with Michael's unique art, the brilliant musicians, singers and dancers that toured with him marveled me. ""Smooth criminal"" is one example of what a group of outstanding professional singers and dancers can contribute to a show like this one. I am so glad I purchased this DVD.

Most energized by him is the audience which becomes a central component of the performance, second only to Jackson himself.

The first album I ever bought with my own money was Michael Jackson's ""Bad"". Then I went backwards from there, got my hands on ""Off The Wall"" and ""Thriller"". I lost interest around ""Dangerous"", to put it bluntly, because of his exceedingly bizarre physical appearance and ""Earth Song with a children's choir and angels"" -type performances.I still think he's a type of genius, and a brilliant pop songwriter (not to mention lead singer, background singer and dancer), who made pop history together with Quincy Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton.Not much live material exists of MJ's concerts, which is a shame. So I went in with an open mind, anxious, having read all the positive reviews of this DVD. Now, when reading this, keep in mind that it's coming from someone who appreciates the man, not from a ""hater"".In short - I wasn't impressed. First of all, there's obviously quite a lot of lip syncing and playback, especially noticeable on ""Black Or White"". You can REALLY easily tell when Jackson is singing live, especially early on in the concert, because his notes fall FLAT, when he's singing live, really often. I've noticed this on a lot of live clips I've seen of him, that he really isn't at his best singing live, I don't know if it's the (enormously physical burden of) dance moves that take their toll, but that's how it is. Still, at least he didn't MURDER a song like Siedah Garrett did during ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"", she was so out of tune and off-key that it hurt.Second - showing the screaming, crying, hysterical, fainting kids over and over again was REALLY unnecessary. Yeah, we get it, MJ's a super star and he has the craziest fans. Would've been ok to show it maybe once. Then again, the cameras managed to get some nice shots once in a while, like the happy hat-wearing girl during ""Billie Jean"".Third - the performance of ""Human Nature""...was just...bizarre. He was barely singing it (I think he messed up the lyrics as well), just making these orgasmic noises and performing a truly strange jerky dance routine in what looked like a golden corset.Fourth - and sure enough, we got the children's choir and angel imagery as well. He had a bad case of Jesus complex in the 1990's.Still ... the dancing was as impressive as ever, the moonwalk on ""Billie Jean"" still amazingly cool after almost two decades, and some of the performances simply kicked a**, like ""Smooth Criminal"".",3,After all the hype on this DVD...I'm not impressed.,1236816000,"03 12, 2009",2009,2503,"['kid', '1980', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'planet', 'time', 'was', 'MJ', 'fan', 'first', 'album', 'ever', 'bought', 'own', 'money', 'was', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Bad', 'Then', 'went', 'backwards', 'there', 'got', 'hands', 'Wall', 'Thriller', 'lost', 'interest', 'Dangerous', 'put', 'bluntly', 'exceedingly', 'bizarre', 'physical', 'appearance', 'Earth', 'Song', 'children', 'choir', 'angels', '-type', 'performances.I', 'still', 'think', 'type', 'genius', 'brilliant', 'pop', 'songwriter', 'not', 'mention', 'lead', 'singer', 'background', 'singer', 'dancer', 'who', 'made', 'pop', 'history', 'together', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'songwriter', 'Rod', 'Temperton.Not', 'much', 'live', 'material', 'exists', 'MJ', 'concerts', 'shame', 'went', 'open', 'mind', 'anxious', 'having', 'read', 'positive', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'Now', 'when', 'reading', 'keep', 'mind', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'man', 'not', 'hater', 'short', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'First', 'all', 'obviously', 'quite', 'lot', 'lip', 'syncing', 'playback', 'especially', 'noticeable', 'Black', 'Or', 'White', 'can', 'REALLY', 'easily', 'tell', 'when', 'Jackson', 'singing', 'live', 'especially', 'early', 'concert', 'notes', 'fall', 'FLAT', 'when', 'singing', 'live', 'really', 'often', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'lot', 'live', 'clips', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'really', ""n't"", 'best', 'singing', 'live', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enormously', 'physical', 'burden', 'dance', 'take', 'toll', 'how', 'Still', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'MURDER', 'song', 'Siedah', 'Garrett', 'did', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Loving', 'was', 'so', 'tune', 'off-key', 'hurt.Second', 'showing', 'screaming', 'crying', 'hysterical', 'fainting', 'kids', 'over', 'again', 'was', 'REALLY', 'unnecessary', 'Yeah', 'get', 'MJ', 'super', 'star', 'craziest', 'fans', 'Would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'ok', 'show', 'maybe', 'once', 'Then', 'again', 'cameras', 'managed', 'get', 'nice', 'shots', 'once', 'while', 'happy', 'hat-wearing', 'girl', 'Billie', 'Jean', '.Third', 'performance', 'Human', 'Nature', 'was', 'just', 'bizarre', 'was', 'barely', 'singing', 'think', 'messed', 'up', 'lyrics', 'well', 'just', 'making', 'orgasmic', 'noises', 'performing', 'truly', 'strange', 'jerky', 'dance', 'routine', 'what', 'looked', 'golden', 'corset.Fourth', 'sure', 'enough', 'got', 'children', 'choir', 'angel', 'imagery', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'bad', 'case', 'Jesus', 'complex', ""1990's.Still"", 'dancing', 'was', 'as', 'impressive', 'ever', 'moonwalk', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'still', 'amazingly', 'cool', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'performances', 'simply', 'kicked', 'a**', 'Smooth', 'Criminal']",Michael Jackson:  Live in Bucharest -The Dangerous Tour

A fan since the earliest days of the Jackson 5, he always amazed me with his jaw-dropping talent but revisiting all of his music and seeing previously unviewed videos just takes my breath away.  Wow!You are in awe watching him perform.  From the opening stunner where he's catapulted onto the stage to the over-the-top departure in a space suit powered by a jetpack, I was mesmerized.  I was just swept up in his magic--loved the control and anticipation that he created by simply standing statue-still when he hit the stage. You almost wondered if he WAS just a statue and it was all just an illusion.  I have no idea how many people were at this concert, but it was a sea of rocking, swaying, ""fainting"", screaming humanity.  They'll never be another entertainer who was so adored, so affected by his fans.  I thought it was particularly touching to see him allow a fan to actually hug him and have him respond with such affection.  He didn't just hug--he LOVINGLY EMBRACED that very, very lucky fan and kissed her sweetly on the cheek.  She sure didn't want to let go.  Who would?Yeah, he lip-synched on several songs but his duet with Sieda Garrett was so great and I had tears in my eyes during the very moving Will You Be There?  No one will ever move as sensually and with such perfect control and grace like he did.  He truly was otherworldly and simply ""became"" the dance when he was on stage, moving to a voice, a vibration heard and felt only by him.Favorite song?  Couldn't possibly name one.  I love them all for the emotions they evoke, for the funk, and the beat and the love they never fail to convey.This is as close as one can get to seeing a young, vibrant, extremely sexy and fabulously-talented Michael Jackson--at the top of his game!I highly recommend this video. If you are a fan, or just curious about his music and genius creativity, you need to get this video.  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!The expression Gone Too Soon seems so inadequate in responding to his tragic and untimely death. As Berry Gordy said in Moonwalk, Michael Jackson comes along only once, period. One of the big regrets of my life is never getting to be part of one of his concerts.How fortunate that we lived and enjoyed him during his time on earth.

There are times he is so out of breath, he falls to his knees, or even flat on his face and just lies there.  The crowd goes wild.  Then he picks himself back up and starts again.  He goes from one gut-busting song to the next.  You can see his chest heaving from excursion.  I have never, in all my life, seen a performer give so much of themselves to an audience.  He is just out there, totally for them, heart and soul.  I would have to say Michael Jackson is the greatest showman I have ever seen. He can cause havoc in the crowd with a tilt of his hat.

Pearson,"[11, 11]","This concert was performed and recorded in 1992 with Michael Jackson at around 33 years of age and definitely in his prime.I only bought this DVD after he passed away as I was expecting to buy a DVD of his upcoming tour as one of the shows would have been recorded for sure. After seeing this one, I too, couldn't believe I waited this long to acquire it !Don't expect high definition sound and picture quality like some reviewers, but in saying that, the picture and sound quality of this show are more than acceptable, in fact still very good.The line up of songs is terrific and are performed with incredible intensity and emotion. The guy definitely sings most of the songs and if there was any lip synching in parts, it was not obvious to me. I was not put off by other comments on this matter.Yes, there are shots of people passing out and being taken away, right from the start of the first song - what a waste of money for them ! And what a crowd - massive in size and all overawed by the occasion. I actually felt these shots added interest and really helped give the viewer a feel for the whole event. The only time audience shots were a little overdone, was probably during ""Man In The Mirror"" at the end of the concert where we see no less than six people being carted out of the arena. Overall I felt the balance between stage and audience shots was pretty good.If this is the only full live concert filmed and likely to be released on DVD of this talented man, then buy it, enjoy it, don't look for faults in it and appreciate the guy at his best !Hopefully we will see a DVD of his rehearsals for the 2009 tour with over 100 hours being taped - who knows.Michael Jackson, you will be sorely missed !",5,Great Concert From The Man In His Prime !,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,1714,"['concert', 'was', 'performed', 'recorded', '1992', 'Michael', 'Jackson', '33', 'years', 'age', 'definitely', 'prime.I', 'only', 'bought', 'DVD', 'passed', 'away', 'was', 'expecting', 'buy', 'DVD', 'upcoming', 'tour', 'one', 'shows', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', 'sure', 'seeing', 'one', 'too', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'waited', 'long', 'acquire', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'high', 'definition', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'reviewers', 'saying', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'show', 'are', 'more', 'acceptable', 'fact', 'still', 'very', 'good.The', 'line', 'songs', 'terrific', 'are', 'performed', 'incredible', 'intensity', 'emotion', 'guy', 'definitely', 'most', 'songs', 'was', 'lip', 'synching', 'parts', 'was', 'not', 'obvious', 'was', 'not', 'put', 'off', 'other', 'comments', 'matter.Yes', 'are', 'shots', 'people', 'passing', 'out', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'right', 'start', 'first', 'song', 'what', 'waste', 'money', 'what', 'crowd', 'massive', 'size', 'overawed', 'occasion', 'actually', 'felt', 'shots', 'added', 'interest', 'really', 'helped', 'give', 'viewer', 'feel', 'whole', 'event', 'only', 'time', 'audience', 'shots', 'were', 'little', 'overdone', 'was', 'probably', 'Man', 'Mirror', 'end', 'concert', 'where', 'see', 'less', 'six', 'people', 'being', 'carted', 'arena', 'Overall', 'felt', 'balance', 'stage', 'audience', 'shots', 'was', 'pretty', 'good.If', 'only', 'full', 'live', 'concert', 'filmed', 'likely', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'talented', 'man', 'then', 'buy', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'faults', 'appreciate', 'guy', 'best', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'see', 'DVD', 'rehearsals', '2009', 'tour', '100', 'hours', 'being', 'taped', 'who', 'knows.Michael', 'Jackson', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'missed']",Michael Jackson:  Live in Bucharest -The Dangerous Tour
919014,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B000A2RRF4,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 12]","Now that the court case is over, can we get back to the music?  You might well ask.  However, truth is, in Michael's case, it has never JUST been about the music.  That's why he was/is(?) a superstar.  Much of it is about his charisma, his image (not really the same thing),eccentricities both endearing and off-putting, as well as the music.  You either bought the package or you didn't.I didn't, actually, which is not to say that I did not recognize Jackson's talent as a singer, dancer and songwriter.  But the last thing I ever bought of his was THRILLER--and then mainly for one song, namely, ""Beat It.""  Yes, the song that impressed me the most was likely the rockiest thing he's ever done.  I liked the sinuous ""Billie Jean"" well enough and the title track was pretty good, but eventually anything with voiceover narration is going to get on my nerves (even if it IS Vincent Price: come to think of it, ESPECIALLY if it's Vincent Price).  But ""Beat It"" really got to the heart of this old rock'n'roller.What came later didn't particularly move me.  Much of the rest of the 80s and 90s product seemed to be a lot less compelling.  Loads of funk riffs with Jackson singing ""Come on, girl"" and ""whee hee"" on top of it.  OK, but nothing that would really grab you.  Maybe all the crotch grabbing was his way of compensating for the fact the music itself was getting less and less grabbing.But this filmed concert in Bucharest is interesting.  Agoraphobe that I am, there is absolutely no way I would ever attend a Jackson concert in person (unless his popularity plummets to the point where he starts playing small clubs or something).  So this was as close as I was ever going to get.  And it was fascinating to watch--especially from a sort of antrhopological perspective.  The cameras are constantly panning to the frenzied audience.  There are more crowd shots here than in any concert video or film I've ever seen.  I suppose this is meant to convey the excitement of an actual MJ concert.  (And one has to acknowledge the significance of a big American-style extravaganza in a post-Cold War, former Soviet Bloc country.  That could only have added to the frenzied excitement.)But frankly, I find it all just a little hard to relate to.  Makes me remember how even when I was a little kid, I didn't understand all those girls screaming at the Beatles.  I wanted to listen to the MUSIC, thank you very much.  Not have some hysteric screaming in my ear.  I guess I'd have to say that the whole superstar trip is pretty much lost on me.  And I'm just as glad.Which is not to say I don't believe Michael Jackson is talented, maybe even a genius of his genre.  But I found it disturbing almost that even during some of the ballads he felt compelled to keep on with the robo-dance moves, just a little more slo-mo.  Why can't he just stand there and sing, I wondered.  Then it dawned on me.  Well, this concert wasn't meant for viewers (and listeners) like me.  I guess the human race will always demand a certain amount of spectacle, and that's fine, I suppose.  That's show biz--and it can even be art.  If there's steak to go along with the sizzle, that's fine.  With Michael Jackson, even circa 1995, it was about 50/50 in the steak to sizzle ratio, though.What it would be today only Jehovah knows.",3,A True Spectacle--If You Like Spectacles,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,3306,"['Now', 'court', 'case', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'music', 'might', 'well', 'ask', 'However', 'truth', 'Michael', 'case', 'never', 'JUST', 'been', 'music', 'why', 'superstar', 'Much', 'charisma', 'image', 'not', 'really', 'same', 'thing', 'endearing', 'off-putting', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'bought', 'package', ""didn't.I"", 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'not', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'recognize', 'Jackson', 'talent', 'singer', 'dancer', 'songwriter', 'last', 'thing', 'ever', 'bought', 'was', 'THRILLER', 'then', 'mainly', 'one', 'song', 'namely', 'Beat', 'Yes', 'song', 'impressed', 'most', 'was', 'likely', 'rockiest', 'thing', 'ever', 'done', 'liked', 'sinuous', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'well', 'enough', 'title', 'track', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'eventually', 'anything', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'going', 'get', 'nerves', 'even', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'come', 'think', 'ESPECIALLY', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Beat', 'really', 'got', 'heart', 'old', 'rock', 'came', 'later', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'move', 'Much', 'rest', '80s', '90s', 'product', 'seemed', 'be', 'lot', 'less', 'compelling', 'Loads', 'funk', 'riffs', 'Jackson', 'singing', 'Come', 'girl', 'whee', 'hee', 'top', 'OK', 'nothing', 'would', 'really', 'grab', 'Maybe', 'crotch', 'grabbing', 'was', 'way', 'compensating', 'fact', 'music', 'was', 'getting', 'less', 'less', 'grabbing.But', 'filmed', 'concert', 'Bucharest', 'interesting', 'Agoraphobe', 'am', 'absolutely', 'way', 'would', 'ever', 'attend', 'Jackson', 'concert', 'person', 'popularity', 'plummets', 'point', 'where', 'playing', 'small', 'clubs', 'something', 'was', 'as', 'close', 'was', 'ever', 'going', 'get', 'was', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'especially', 'sort', 'antrhopological', 'perspective', 'cameras', 'are', 'constantly', 'panning', 'frenzied', 'audience', 'are', 'more', 'crowd', 'shots', 'here', 'concert', 'video', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'suppose', 'meant', 'convey', 'excitement', 'actual', 'MJ', 'concert', 'one', 'acknowledge', 'significance', 'big', 'American-style', 'extravaganza', 'post-Cold', 'War', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Bloc', 'country', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'added', 'frenzied', 'excitement', 'frankly', 'find', 'just', 'little', 'hard', 'relate', 'Makes', 'remember', 'how', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'girls', 'screaming', 'Beatles', 'wanted', 'listen', 'MUSIC', 'thank', 'very', 'much', 'Not', 'have', 'hysteric', 'screaming', 'ear', 'guess', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'whole', 'superstar', 'trip', 'pretty', 'much', 'lost', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad.Which', 'not', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'talented', 'maybe', 'even', 'genius', 'genre', 'found', 'disturbing', 'almost', 'even', 'ballads', 'felt', 'compelled', 'keep', 'robo-dance', 'moves', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'slo-mo', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'stand', 'there', 'sing', 'wondered', 'Then', 'dawned', 'Well', 'concert', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'viewers', 'listeners', 'guess', 'human', 'race', 'will', 'always', 'demand', 'certain', 'amount', 'spectacle', 'fine', 'suppose', 'show', 'biz', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'art', 'steak', 'go', 'along', 'sizzle', 'fine', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'even', 'circa', '1995', 'was', 'about', '50/50', 'steak', 'sizzle', 'ratio', 'would', 'be', 'today', 'only', 'Jehovah', 'knows']",Michael Jackson:  Live in Bucharest -The Dangerous Tour

Of course, you can't ask for much as he is always dancing and jumping and when he gets to sing he is very excited, his heart beating fast so you can imagine the results: he hardly sings, the chorists always have to complete Michael's singing. Another dissapointing fact is the constant shots of people going into euphoria and fainting like if they saw God. It is really disturbing. This is a must have DVD for any Michael Jackson fan as it is the only live DVD of him available, but for the casual fan like me you should know that instead of seeing Michael Jackson actually SINGING you will see him dancing, shouting, touching himself alongs with obsessed fans needing medical attention.

Anyway, this concert originally aired on HBO back in '89 and I can remember watching it back then, awed by the endless throng of fans, by the pomp and splendor and majesty of this man's mystique, and by the production values dedicated to each and every one of his numbers, which are absolutely unbelievable. This guy was not only the greatest dancer who ever lived, he was an iron man. The energy he puts into each and every song in this concert is like a James Cameron film jacked up on steroids. Mike was an alien.Looking at it now makes me appreciate just how great this guy was as a performer and the black hole his death created in the entertainment world. This guy was a superstar from the time he was nine years old to the time of his death a couple of years ago, going from being a cute mini James Brown back in the early Seventies to the tall, supernaturally gifted dancer AND SINGER whose fans, unlike himself,remained as young as they were when he was a kid. Truly, his songs provide a soundtrack for my life, each one brings back a specific memory of where I was, my school, old friends I used to know back in my old neighborhood I grew up in, good memories as well as bad his songs were always around marking time. Regardless of what was published, true, untrue, or strange, about his personal life, there was no denying the pureness of his songs, songs about love and innocence, songs you don't have to bleep because of all the curse words, songs any kid of any age can listen to, songs about magic as he himself was magic and a miracle. I heard an interview he did where he spoke on immortality saying that he tried to put everything he had into each of his songs, to fuse his soul to them, and that this was his way of achieving immortality. Listening to his songs on this video it's like he's still here. Thanks, Mike.",5,Magic!,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,1875,"['Ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'been', 'almost', '3', 'years', 'Anyway', 'concert', 'originally', 'aired', 'HBO', 'back', ""'89"", 'can', 'remember', 'watching', 'back', 'then', 'awed', 'endless', 'throng', 'fans', 'pomp', 'splendor', 'majesty', 'man', 'mystique', 'production', 'values', 'dedicated', 'one', 'numbers', 'are', 'absolutely', 'unbelievable', 'guy', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'greatest', 'dancer', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'was', 'iron', 'man', 'energy', 'song', 'concert', 'James', 'Cameron', 'film', 'jacked', 'up', 'steroids', 'Mike', 'was', 'alien.Looking', 'now', 'appreciate', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'guy', 'was', 'performer', 'black', 'hole', 'death', 'created', 'entertainment', 'world', 'guy', 'was', 'superstar', 'time', 'was', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'death', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'going', 'being', 'cute', 'mini', 'James', 'Brown', 'back', 'early', 'Seventies', 'tall', 'supernaturally', 'gifted', 'dancer', 'AND', 'SINGER', 'fans', 'remained', 'as', 'young', 'were', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Truly', 'songs', 'provide', 'soundtrack', 'life', 'one', 'back', 'specific', 'memory', 'where', 'was', 'school', 'old', 'friends', 'used', 'know', 'back', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'grew', 'up', 'good', 'memories', 'as', 'well', 'bad', 'songs', 'were', 'always', 'marking', 'time', 'Regardless', 'what', 'was', 'published', 'true', 'untrue', 'strange', 'personal', 'life', 'was', 'denying', 'pureness', 'songs', 'songs', 'love', 'innocence', 'songs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'bleep', 'curse', 'words', 'songs', 'kid', 'age', 'can', 'listen', 'songs', 'about', 'magic', 'was', 'magic', 'miracle', 'heard', 'interview', 'did', 'where', 'spoke', 'immortality', 'saying', 'tried', 'put', 'everything', 'had', 'songs', 'fuse', 'soul', 'was', 'way', 'achieving', 'immortality', 'Listening', 'songs', 'video', 'still', 'here', 'Thanks', 'Mike']",Michael Jackson:  Live in Bucharest -The Dangerous Tour

It is quite difficult to understand what he is saying even when singing. I dont know why they dont take the sound direct from the mikes and not from the speaker system. Second, film quality is poor to fair at best. From what I am hearing this common with all his concert DVD's and this is a tragety if its so, the King of POP in this day and age has no filmography worthy of his status!!! Third and most annoying, whoever directed/edited this DVD stood fast to the 5 second rule, no scene shall last more than 5 seconds. This can actually get nauseating with all these quick cuts and gratuitous shots of the audience to ad nauseum!!! Who cares, when he is on stage I want to see this guy Move and they actually cut away from some intricate dance sequences of Michael and cast to showing fainting screaming fans. Ridiculous.This is no slight against the talent of Michael as even with all these flaws this DVD shows a HARD working talent giving his fans all he has.

I enter Circuit City at Union Square in NYC with my wife, who is from Japan, and this DVD is on three modestly sized plasma TVs a the top of the escalator--which is crowded with mesmorized viewers.We could not help it.  The show was so awesome that we found ourselves standing there, entranced.My wife put it correctly when she said to me in Japanese, ""Whatever he does in life, people will always be facinated with his performances,"" meaning no matter what freakish things he does to or with his body, it just plain wont effect the fact that he truly is the King of Pop (though I must then appoint Prince as the Emperor of Pop--sorry Michael).That really summed it up; we were watching one of the all time great masters of performance, and indeed were lucky to be alive when his career was in full swing.Michael Jackson is one of the all time greats--like Harry Houdini, Fred Astaire, Jimmy Hendrix, or Miles Davis.  He's a master of the stage, and--though I protest with myself--has a fantastic musical ability that can't help but mesmorize.On this DVD, there is of course a lot of lip synching.  This isn't so much a music concert as a stage show.  And as a stage show, it's one of the greatest of all time.  Just seeing Jackson dance to his own music is worth your money.*****There was one musical break that was facinating, though it wasn't performed by Jackson.  At one point in the performance, he shares the stage with a solo guitarist--apparrently just for effect--but the guitarist completely takes over the stage.  Jackson points him out to a stage hand, who tries to stop the solo, and the guitarist just keeps going with a fantastic, mad, crazy solo.It's pretty rare to see a solo like that unless you're in the biz.  I immediately thought of Mike Stern--who this was not--totally dominating the show.  Jackson should have let him go a bit longer, but instead started the next bit and had the guitarist's plug pulled.Bottom Line: I suppose that says a lot about Jackson's way of performing--he's a perfectionist; it's all planned out, and it follows the plan exactly.  Other performers would have played counterpoint to that solo (as the guitarist was starting to do when Jackson 'interrupted), shared the limelight, and acknowledged that this is what musical performance is really all about--that there's really no such thing as a solo artist, unless of course you're Michael Jackson.Anyway, I can't help but give this DVD 5 stars on sheer greatness.",5,"""I am NOT a Michael Jackson fan,"" is what I keep telling myself.",1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,2475,"['Yesterday', 'enter', 'Circuit', 'City', 'Union', 'Square', 'NYC', 'wife', 'who', 'Japan', 'DVD', 'three', 'modestly', 'sized', 'plasma', 'top', 'escalator', 'crowded', 'mesmorized', 'viewers.We', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'awesome', 'found', 'standing', 'there', 'entranced.My', 'wife', 'put', 'correctly', 'when', 'said', 'Japanese', 'life', 'people', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'facinated', 'performances', 'meaning', 'matter', 'what', 'freakish', 'things', 'body', 'just', 'plain', 'wont', 'effect', 'fact', 'truly', 'King', 'Pop', 'must', 'then', 'appoint', 'Prince', 'Emperor', 'Pop', 'sorry', 'Michael', 'really', 'summed', 'up', 'were', 'watching', 'one', 'time', 'great', 'masters', 'performance', 'indeed', 'were', 'lucky', 'be', 'alive', 'when', 'career', 'was', 'full', 'swing.Michael', 'Jackson', 'one', 'time', 'greats', 'Harry', 'Houdini', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Jimmy', 'Hendrix', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'master', 'stage', 'protest', 'fantastic', 'musical', 'ability', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'mesmorize.On', 'DVD', 'course', 'lot', 'lip', 'synching', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'music', 'concert', 'stage', 'show', 'stage', 'show', 'one', 'greatest', 'time', 'Just', 'seeing', 'Jackson', 'dance', 'own', 'music', 'money', 'was', 'one', 'musical', 'break', 'was', 'facinating', 'was', ""n't"", 'performed', 'Jackson', 'one', 'point', 'performance', 'shares', 'stage', 'solo', 'guitarist', 'apparrently', 'just', 'effect', 'guitarist', 'completely', 'stage', 'Jackson', 'out', 'stage', 'hand', 'who', 'stop', 'solo', 'guitarist', 'just', 'going', 'fantastic', 'mad', 'crazy', 'solo.It', 'pretty', 'rare', 'see', 'solo', ""'re"", 'biz', 'immediately', 'thought', 'Mike', 'Stern', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'totally', 'dominating', 'show', 'Jackson', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'go', 'bit', 'longer', 'instead', 'started', 'next', 'bit', 'had', 'guitarist', 'plug', 'pulled.Bottom', 'Line', 'suppose', 'lot', 'Jackson', 'way', 'performing', 'perfectionist', 'planned', 'out', 'plan', 'exactly', 'Other', 'performers', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'counterpoint', 'solo', 'guitarist', 'was', 'starting', 'do', 'when', 'Jackson', ""'interrupted"", 'shared', 'limelight', 'acknowledged', 'what', 'musical', 'performance', 'really', 'about', 'really', 'such', 'thing', 'solo', 'artist', 'course', ""'re"", 'Michael', 'Jackson.Anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'give', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'sheer', 'greatness']",Michael Jackson:  Live in Bucharest -The Dangerous Tour

Great use of illusion throughout the show with a great stunt at the closer :)  I noticed there are complaints about the amount of audience shots shown, including way too many fainting and getting carted off by paramedics.  I agree with this, but luckily after the first few songs that dies way down (as does the crotch grabbing that annoys some people), but there is another resurgence of fainters during Man in the Mirror at the end.  Also I'm surprised how many people said there was lip syncing, to the point where I was expecting most of the show would be that way.  However, the only song that seemed there was lip syncing was Thriller, and that was due to the fact he wears a wolf mask half way through I'd imagine!  Possibly there were a couple more, but for the most part it was clearly live singing and he was FANTASTIC!  I was about to list my favorite moments, but I realized I'd have to list half the set list!!

This concert at Bucherst is a timecapsule of the genius that once was. There were only a handful that were on his level (Think Janet,Madonna, & Prince) This was an incredible show and the energy was off the charts. His dancing ...spot on. Hit after hit...the concert could have been a bit longer....but then again look at his extensive catalog of songs to choose from he could have been on stage playing all night. If you like his music and you havent (or have) not gotten the chance to see him live than this is a must have. It may infact be the only chance (unless other concerts are released) to do so. My Oh my how times have changed the music of lately really s**ks (think AMERICAN IDIOT er i mean idol???) and im not even going to go into the circus that has happened over the past decade but was it media over kill...hateful exemployees doing kiss n tells or (gasp!!!make that double gasp!) could have some of his own actions that has brought this all about...on to him self????? Indeed he may have trusted the wrong people but there is a thing called common sence and the man does have a great intellect other wise the wonderful music he ceated would have never existed....Ok i cant resist one shot What in the blue heck was he thinking dangiling a baby out a window any way???? Ok i vented...now back to the music..and there is plenty of it and for that we are fortunate indeed. But the events of late and all the sorrow may have taken a huge toll on MJ physically and emotionally and one wonders if (and when) he will ever regain the magic that made him one of the worlds most endering entertainers..In that answer im not that optomistic and i wouldnt blame him a bit either. He who has always had a big heart has been more than taken advantage of and regardless of weather or not the charges were true or not and yes he was found NOT GUILTY how could he want to open up and share his world with anyone again. I think if he wants to start the healing he needs to go out on tour and soon if not solo have  a reunion tour with the entire family in concert (and yes include Janet as well). He needs to connect with his fans and stop letting the media making him and his life in to a freak show. Its not right.

The concert was amazing and one of the most important moments of my life.  Michael was sensational, not only does he move, sing and dance like no one else but he transforms the whole arena with his incredible stage presence.  You are literally seeing one of the best performers on stage ever, if not the best!It would be difficult to capture this brilliance on DVD, not to mention the atmosphere but I would say the Bucharest Dangerous concert DVD comes very close.  I have watched it numerous times and even now it brings out all kinds of emotions.  The quality is excellent and you get to see the magnificence of Michael Jackson plus the astonishing reactions from the crowd so you can literally feel the atmosphere.This concert is quite simply a point in history, a time when a musician could bring out pure emotion in a crowd through excellence in music and dance.Buy this, you won't see a better artist in concert and I guarantee anyone who takes a chance on this will be a fan.  I became one after the Dangerous Concert in Leeds and I've been to many more concerts since.  He never fails to please.  Highly recommended!Full Tracking Listing:1. ""Introduction""2. ""Jam""3.

I just always expected a new one because he was constantly performing, but with his shocking death, I had to grab a copy of this DVD immediately. I needed to see him perform, not just rely on my memory especially since I'd never seen him live. DVDs are cool andNumber Onesand20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best of Jackson 5are in heavy rotation on my car and home stereo, but nothing beats a live performance. Jackson knew how to make his audience cry, laugh, scream, pull their hair out, faint, clutch onto him tighter than a monkey's arms, and they did all that and more in this DVD. My favorite performance on here was ""She's Out of My Life"" when a fan went nuts as soon as she was able to hug him, and when he kissed her, whoa, I thought she'd melt into the stage floor.

I actually bought it for my foster boy who loves music and dance and was hoping we would watch it together. Glad I previewed it first! MJ's incessant crotch-grabbing started within the first 30 seconds and did not subside. Wow. I was pretty uncomfortable watching it so I sure wasn't going to let the child see this. I'm no prude. I was a dancer for many years and have been to many topless cabarets, etc. which I enjoyed but MJ was really creeping me out. Aside from this, the audio is less than exciting. Hollow is a good description, and not a lot of clarity. Pretty poor camera work too. Perhaps my biggest criticism though was the relentless footage of crying, fainting fans. Yikes! The only good thing about that was the respite it gave from MJ's grab bag. I could not have cared less about the fans, yet the film maker insisted on cutting back and forth between them and the performance on stage. Booo! Sooo disappointing on many levels. I watched the first 30 minutes and then couldn't manage anymore. Plus, I was pretty sure my husband's head might explode if I didn't turn it off. Anyway, feeling pretty good about never having shelled out a lotta dough to see this LIVE! I just purchased a new personal CD player for my boy along with the ""Jackson 5's Greatest Hits.""
