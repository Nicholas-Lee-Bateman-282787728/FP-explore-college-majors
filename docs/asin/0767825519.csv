I like this movie a lot because it shows a side of the military very often forgotten.

Coppola's treatment of the Old Guard during the time of upheaval that was the Vietnam  era brings home the true despair that both the public and some members of  the military felt during the war.This movie sports several great  performances.  James Caan and James Earl Jones in particular stand out.  Those two along with D. B. Sweeney, Angelica Huston, Joe Desjardin,  Lawrence Fishburn, Dean Stockwell and Sam Bottoms make a great  &quot;war&quot; movie without ever showing a battle.  The characters  develop the story and make this movie worth not just one, but several  watches.There were several great Vietnam movies that came out in the  80's, but as much as any of them, this movie truly brought home the  feelings of the time to someone who was not yet an adult during that time.This movie did not get a lot of publicity that Platoon, Full Metal  Jacket and Apocolypse Now received, but it is just as powerful and  entertaining as those movies.See this movie.

Doing a movie about the Old Guard and Arlington during the Vietnam War was pretty brave considering the sympathy displayed for the men involved...You have a PSG (platoon dad)James Caan, torn by demands of duty and a family lost to him because of that duty. (This should reasonate with all of us vets who lost our families because of our duty) He has a job he hates and one he knows he is good at but still wants a return to his line job of leading infantrymen.  You have the CSM (sargeant major) James Earl Jones, the young gung ho troop DB Sweeny (they are alot more numerous then common perception would have), Dean Stockwell as the CO(company commander) Anjelica Huston as Caan's anti war love interest and a fine supporting cast.I was really impressed with the overall story line.  I disagree with many of the other reviewers as this is not an anti war movie.  Coppola did his research and the movie really does a great job of showing what life is often like in the Army.  He showed the little details (M14 rifles and the detail in the barracks TA50 inspection) that Hollywood so seldom gets despite the military advisors they hire to check out scripts.  The day to day workings of the Machine in garrison brought back alot of memories too.  The Army was really like this People, it is/was a very tight organization and the Old Guard is a good example of that tightness.I have worked w/those guys and seen them at their job.  Despite all the pressures, they seldom (almost never in the public eye) fall down.  The stuff that goes on behind the public eye is what makes the story so compelling.

18173,AYMPVLWFKTAYE,0767825519,"Erin K. Darling ""naive cynic""","[4, 4]","Francis Ford Coppola is one of my favorite directors ever, and he has done another great job with ""Gardens of Stone."" I had only the tiniest fraction of an idea what this film was about prior to watching it, so I had no expectations going in. The film opens with a powerful scene; a soldier is being buried in Arlington, and Coppola spends long moments on the widow's anguished face; Mary Stuart Masterson conveys such depths of sorrow that tears welled in  my eyes instantly, even though I didn't know who any of the characters were at that point, or understand how the soldier had died.Sadly, the relationship between Masterson and Sweeny didn't get fleshed out fully through the movie, and I wish it had been - it would have added another layer to Sweeny's character. The relationship that was most interesting in the story is that between James Caan and James Earl Jones; they play old war buddies and best friends, and they do an excellent job of it. Their facial expressions, body language, voice inflections, everything - they are truly outstanding actors.There are many moments of laughter in the film, followed by powerful and profound moments of sorrow, and Coppola balances them out very well. It's a film primarily about friendship, but also about love, respect, politics, living and dying. I really recommend it to anyone who enjoys military movies, but it's not *just* an Army movie.

18174,A2VE83MZF98ITY,0767825519,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[33, 35]","This is a film with a difference -- many people come to it with preconceived notions of how a military-themed film should be, and are somewhat disappointed.  This is not an action film, and while it fits the overall genre of being a protest film about Vietnam, it is not unambiguously so.  It is an anti-war film, to be sure, but is not an anti-military or even anti-American film.  It has an emphasis on duty and honour that transcends minor considerations of the particular patriotism for particular nations -- the themes as old as the Roman centurion's honour for fallen compatriots run through to the Old Guard at Arlington National Cemetary.The plot winds its way around the Old Guard, the honour guard at Arlington National Cemetary, charged with the performance of a hallowed trust, one of the few in a secular nation such as the United States -- that of overseeing the gravesites of the honoured dead who died after service to the nation, including the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  The primary senior characters are Platoon Sergeant Hazard (James Caan) and Sergeant Major Nelson (James Earl Jones), two crusty veterans overseeing operations; both served in Korea and Vietnam with distinction, and are now sitting on the sidelines of the expanding war in Vietnam in a place where the body count is very apparent.  Into this mix comes the young and idealistic Specialist Willow (D.B. Sweeney in one of his earliest roles), an Army brat whose father is (of course) a friend of Hazard and Nelson.Willow has an unrequited love (played by Mary Stuart Masterson) in the daughter of a colonel, who seems to think that the son of a sergeant is beneath his daughter, even as Willow has ambition toward becoming an officer.  Willow also has ambition toward the experience of real combat -- he sees duty at the Arlington National Cemetary as being uneventful -- Willow is certainly not a Patton-esque character, but rather portrays that element of the military and citizenry who wishes to be where the action is when action is happening.  Hazard (and, to a lesser extent, Nelson), being world weary, tries to temper Willow's enthusiasm, knowing (and stating several times) that Vietnam is not the typical war -- when Willow says that he wants to be on the front lines, the retort from the more experienced soldiers is invariably that there is no front line in Vietnam.  Ultimately, Willow does make it to Vietnam, and Hazard does decide to leave the Old Guard for a more active engagement in the war where he can do more good (or so he feels) than simply burying the dead who return.Hazard also is involved (as a subplot) with a woman who struggles to deal with the contradictory nature of the war, embodied by Hazard (Angelica Huston plays the correspondent who has a largely anti-war feeling, but again this is tempered by not being anti-military).  Hazard's intimacy with her grows throughout the film, being tested when he announces his intention to leave the cemetary duty and go to Vietnam service; Willow's father dies early in the film, thrusting Hazard into a fatherly role, so the trio become a makeshift family of sorts.From my visits to Arlington and conversation and correspondence I've had with those who have worked there, this film is fairly accurate in its portrayal of the procedures of the place.  There are some things which never change, and perhaps one of the more constant places of military tradition is here.The backdrop of Coppola dealing with the death of his own son runs as a sombre tone throughout this tale, that has both high points and tragic points.  The ending is somewhat predictable but no less poignant for being so.  Coppola's idea that even with all the honour a mighty nation can muster, death is still tragic and war often has few winners (and certainly the Vietnam had no true winners) remains steady here.There are few DVD extras, but the picture and sound quality is enhanced, with the full-screen and wide-screen options available.",5,In eternal glory...,1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,3974,"['film', 'difference', 'many', 'people', 'come', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'how', 'military-themed', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'are', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'overall', 'genre', 'being', 'protest', 'film', 'Vietnam', 'not', 'unambiguously', 'so', 'anti-war', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'anti-military', 'even', 'anti-American', 'film', 'emphasis', 'duty', 'honour', 'minor', 'considerations', 'particular', 'patriotism', 'particular', 'nations', 'themes', 'as', 'old', 'Roman', 'centurion', 'honour', 'fallen', 'compatriots', 'run', 'Old', 'Guard', 'Arlington', 'National', 'Cemetary.The', 'plot', 'way', 'Old', 'Guard', 'honour', 'guard', 'Arlington', 'National', 'Cemetary', 'charged', 'performance', 'hallowed', 'trust', 'one', 'few', 'secular', 'nation', 'such', 'United', 'States', 'overseeing', 'gravesites', 'honoured', 'dead', 'who', 'died', 'service', 'nation', 'including', 'Tomb', 'Unknown', 'Soldier', 'primary', 'senior', 'characters', 'are', 'Platoon', 'Sergeant', 'Hazard', 'James', 'Caan', 'Sergeant', 'Major', 'Nelson', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'two', 'crusty', 'veterans', 'overseeing', 'operations', 'served', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'distinction', 'are', 'now', 'sitting', 'sidelines', 'expanding', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'place', 'where', 'body', 'count', 'very', 'apparent', 'mix', 'young', 'idealistic', 'Specialist', 'Willow', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'one', 'earliest', 'roles', 'Army', 'brat', 'father', 'course', 'friend', 'Hazard', 'Nelson.Willow', 'unrequited', 'love', 'played', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'daughter', 'colonel', 'who', 'think', 'son', 'sergeant', 'daughter', 'even', 'Willow', 'ambition', 'becoming', 'officer', 'Willow', 'also', 'ambition', 'experience', 'real', 'combat', 'duty', 'Arlington', 'National', 'Cemetary', 'being', 'uneventful', 'Willow', 'certainly', 'not', 'Patton-esque', 'character', 'rather', 'element', 'military', 'citizenry', 'who', 'wishes', 'be', 'where', 'action', 'when', 'action', 'happening', 'Hazard', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Nelson', 'being', 'world', 'weary', 'tries', 'temper', 'Willow', 'enthusiasm', 'knowing', 'stating', 'several', 'times', 'Vietnam', 'not', 'typical', 'war', 'when', 'Willow', 'be', 'front', 'lines', 'retort', 'more', 'experienced', 'soldiers', 'invariably', 'front', 'line', 'Vietnam', 'Ultimately', 'Willow', 'make', 'Vietnam', 'Hazard', 'decide', 'leave', 'Old', 'Guard', 'more', 'active', 'engagement', 'war', 'where', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'good', 'so', 'simply', 'burying', 'dead', 'who', 'also', 'involved', 'subplot', 'woman', 'who', 'deal', 'contradictory', 'nature', 'war', 'embodied', 'Hazard', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'correspondent', 'who', 'largely', 'anti-war', 'feeling', 'again', 'tempered', 'not', 'being', 'anti-military', 'Hazard', 'intimacy', 'grows', 'film', 'being', 'tested', 'when', 'intention', 'leave', 'cemetary', 'duty', 'go', 'Vietnam', 'service', 'Willow', 'father', 'early', 'film', 'thrusting', 'Hazard', 'fatherly', 'role', 'trio', 'become', 'makeshift', 'family', 'sorts.From', 'visits', 'Arlington', 'conversation', 'correspondence', ""'ve"", 'had', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'there', 'film', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'procedures', 'place', 'are', 'things', 'never', 'change', 'perhaps', 'one', 'more', 'constant', 'places', 'military', 'tradition', 'here.The', 'backdrop', 'Coppola', 'dealing', 'death', 'own', 'son', 'sombre', 'tone', 'tale', 'high', 'points', 'tragic', 'points', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'less', 'poignant', 'being', 'so', 'Coppola', 'idea', 'even', 'honour', 'mighty', 'nation', 'can', 'muster', 'death', 'still', 'tragic', 'war', 'often', 'few', 'winners', 'certainly', 'Vietnam', 'had', 'true', 'winners', 'steady', 'are', 'few', 'DVD', 'extras', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'enhanced', 'full-screen', 'wide-screen', 'options', 'available']",N/A

His Platoon Sergeant, Clell Hazard (James Caan), is a highly decorated Korean and Vietnam war veteran that is also fighting his own demons about whether he should go back to Vietnam to help lead unexperienced soldiers that are dying at an atrocious rate.Sergeant Major Goody Nelson (James Earl Jones)is a fellow veteran of Korea and Vietnam and very close to Sergeant Hazard. Both, try as they may, want to dissuade Specialist Willow from going to fight in a war that is virtually unwinnable and wreaking havoc on the American hearts and minds.Sergeant Hazard begins a tenuous relationship with an anti-war correspondant (Angelica Huston) who has her own ambiguous feelings about the war and the toll it is taking on all around her. Sergeant Hazard must balance his relationship, the Army, the daily burial of large numbers of dead soldiers, and his own troubled feelings on everthing unfolding around him.Specialist Willow, by chance, encounters his old girlfriend (Mary Stuart Masterson) who he had planned to marry at one time but has not seen in years due to them going their own ways over differences they had. Rekindling their lost love, they end up getting married and Willow continually pursues his goal of becoming an officer.As the year 1968 unfolds, we find that Willow has become an officer and is sent to Vietnam. In the end, we see the death of a beloved friend and soldier and the impact it has taken on his new wife, his friends, and the fellow soldiers in his life.Some reviewers have said that the movie moves too slowly and is not exciting enough and is boring. A small news flash for everyone - this in NOT an action movie but a drama and a very good one at that. The plot develops nicely throughout and doesn't stray from the subjects at hand. Eventually it leads up to a somewhat predictable climax but it is quite poignant and sad at the same time.The acting in the movie was very well done with an exellent cast of fine actors. James Caan, James Earl Jones, D.B. Sweeney, Lawrence Fisburne, Mary Stuart Masterson, Angelica Huston, and Dean Stockwell. All provide very real and touching scenes that lend credence to an exceptional Vietnam movie. The DVD itself leaves a little to be desired. There were 3 trailers offered but none of them was for the featured movie. There are no featurettes or other extras one may expect. The upside is that the movie has been digitally mastered in audio and anamorphic video and has a superb picture with very good sound even if it is Dolby 2 channel surround.For those looking to see a Vietnam war movie from a different perspective without having to be in the direct center of it (Platoon, Hamburger Hill, etc.), you will probably find this movie very watchable and enjoyable. It is well worth the price and exceedingly well done.",4,A different look at the Vietnam war,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,3331,"['Vietnam', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'date', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'too', 'many', 'show', 'view', 'soldiers', 'did', ""n't"", 'fight', 'war', 'movie', 'soldiers', 'Army', 'Old', 'Guard', 'had', 'bury', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'Arlington', 'Cemetery', 'who', 'died', 'Vietnam', 'story', 'unfolds', '1967', 'Specialist', 'Jackie', 'Willow', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'coming', 'Old', 'Guard', 'part', 'Army', 'tour', 'duty', 'Willow', 'big', 'plans', 'becoming', 'officer', 'serving', 'Vietnam', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'Platoon', 'Sergeant', 'Clell', 'Hazard', 'James', 'Caan', 'highly', 'decorated', 'Korean', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'veteran', 'also', 'fighting', 'own', 'demons', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'Vietnam', 'help', 'lead', 'unexperienced', 'soldiers', 'are', 'dying', 'atrocious', 'rate.Sergeant', 'Major', 'Goody', 'Nelson', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'fellow', 'veteran', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'very', 'close', 'Sergeant', 'Hazard', 'Both', 'try', 'may', 'want', 'dissuade', 'Specialist', 'Willow', 'going', 'fight', 'war', 'virtually', 'unwinnable', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'American', 'hearts', 'minds.Sergeant', 'Hazard', 'tenuous', 'relationship', 'anti-war', 'correspondant', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'who', 'own', 'ambiguous', 'feelings', 'war', 'toll', 'taking', 'Sergeant', 'Hazard', 'must', 'balance', 'relationship', 'Army', 'daily', 'burial', 'large', 'numbers', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'own', 'troubled', 'feelings', 'everthing', 'unfolding', 'him.Specialist', 'Willow', 'chance', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'who', 'had', 'planned', 'marry', 'one', 'time', 'not', 'seen', 'years', 'due', 'going', 'own', 'ways', 'differences', 'had', 'Rekindling', 'lost', 'love', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'married', 'Willow', 'continually', 'goal', 'becoming', 'officer.As', 'year', '1968', 'unfolds', 'find', 'Willow', 'become', 'officer', 'sent', 'Vietnam', 'end', 'see', 'death', 'beloved', 'friend', 'soldier', 'impact', 'taken', 'new', 'wife', 'friends', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'life.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'too', 'slowly', 'not', 'exciting', 'enough', 'boring', 'small', 'news', 'flash', 'everyone', 'NOT', 'action', 'movie', 'drama', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'plot', 'nicely', ""n't"", 'stray', 'subjects', 'hand', 'Eventually', 'up', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'climax', 'quite', 'poignant', 'sad', 'same', 'time.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'exellent', 'cast', 'fine', 'actors', 'James', 'Caan', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'Lawrence', 'Fisburne', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'provide', 'very', 'real', 'touching', 'scenes', 'lend', 'credence', 'exceptional', 'Vietnam', 'movie', 'DVD', 'little', 'be', 'desired', 'were', '3', 'trailers', 'offered', 'none', 'was', 'featured', 'movie', 'are', 'featurettes', 'other', 'extras', 'one', 'may', 'expect', 'upside', 'movie', 'been', 'digitally', 'mastered', 'audio', 'anamorphic', 'video', 'superb', 'picture', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'even', 'Dolby', '2', 'channel', 'surround.For', 'looking', 'see', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'movie', 'different', 'perspective', 'having', 'be', 'direct', 'center', 'Platoon', 'Hamburger', 'Hill', 'etc', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'movie', 'very', 'watchable', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'price', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'done']",N/A

Before one embarks on a war or support of one, they should watch this film that gets to the heart of the matter, human cost. This movie is the story of the 3rd Infantry, The Old Guard.  We see them on parade at WHite House functions and patrolling in front of the tombs of the unkowns but I think it is forgotten that they have a military mission as well.  This mission is illustrated in the film, over and above the ceremonial.James Caan as a tired NCO meeting an eager young soldier.  The soldier meets a girl, they get married.  He goes to OCS and Vietnam and returns to the Old Guard in a coffin.  I think he was understanding what Caan was trying to tell him when he was killed.This is a difficult movie to watch as Caan attempts to win a woman with strong anti-war feelings.  Caan is speaking from a world weariness of having been in two wars and knows first hand, what this woman can only intelectualize and the gap between them is what Caan is attempting to bridge.  It is an interesting plot and one that is quite realistic.The final scenes, at the gravesite, are dramatic and telling.  In its depiction it is seen frequently in the real world as more and more soldiers, Marines and Sailors come home to Arlington in the years since I wrote this.This is a sober movie, with a few light moments, and is in reality a realistic look at what life was like for soldiers burying their fellows at Arlington.

18184,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,0767825519,The Mysterious Traveler,"[3, 12]","GARDENS OF STONE (1987) Produced and Directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Score by Carmine Coppola.Starring James Caan, Anjelica Huston, Dean Stockwell, Mary Stuart Masterson, Lonette McKee, Laurence Fishburne and James Earl Jones.The film purports to be about the U. S. Army's Old Guard who handle the burial detail of veterans at Arlington cemetery and three sergents--two older and one young and the various women and others in their lives during the Vietnam War in the late 60s.Actually what it is is a great--though not unclever-- Trojan Horse as Coppola--perhaps disatisfied with how APOCALYPSE NOW came out-- makes another go at the Commie prop Anti Vietnam War film. However it is now 1987 and Ronald Reagan is reducing the Soviet Union to the dust of history and millions are being liberated.........except for Indochina. And so we have a great many Liberals with egg on their faces who have spent the last two decades smearing the American Soldier and generally making an ass of themselves. So how can we relieve them of the responsibility of their actions?Well how about the old rhetorical ploy of reversing reality--when in danger of losing a debate simply accuse your opponent of being what they are against and against what they are for. To wit: A patriotic American is really anti-American. A conservative is really a fascist. Christians are just like Moslem Barbarians. Or here. Have the main military characters be against the Vietnam War. Instead of having the teenage character be the font of wisdom before hapless adults, have the adults be the wise ones........as long as it is the teen who supports the war while the adults oppose it. Portray the military characters in a positive light and not as drooling incompetent drug addled Nazi baby killer rapists........but only those that agree with the Party Line. Those who support the War are still drooling incompetent drug addled Nazi baby killer rapists but only offscreen. And finally have the main military character approve of the Leftist antiwar character(who earlier referred to American's actions in the War as genocide) when she tells him that she will do everything in her power to insure America's defeat to such a degree that he asks her to marry her. SEE??? The Left are not anti-military!! We portrayed two soldiers in a good light and even allowed one of our women to associate with him!! SEE?? We did not betray the country and the Vietnamese people. The Military(or rather one member of the military) agrees with us!!! It was not our fault!! We were right!! We are always right........even when we are wrong.Coppola goes through the motions of pretending to present all sides of the issues but the dialogue is incredibly shallow and empty. Really just variations of ""I'M FER IT!! I'M AGIN IT!!"" repeted ad nauseum. A serious discussion of the Vietnam War pro and con is NOT a conversation Coppola wants to have. The War is presented as being somehow different from all other wars........but no one ever says why. Caan's character is against the War because it is not being fought right........but never explains the right way. The young pro-war sergent's position is little more than ""We beat Hitler..therefore......"" It becomes very obvious by the 75 minute mark that the filmmakers simply do not understand the miliary characters at the heart of the film and are flailing to make them appear human. And the Liberal characters constantly weigh in with their condescending little barbs(It's genocide. Anyone who supports the War is immature and ignorant. Soldiers returning from Vietnam are....different....presumably from all that drooling baby killing. Masterson has a ludicrous speech about returning Vets where I swear I expected her to start intoning ""Even a man who is pure at heart........"") without ever getting called on it. And it is telling that the film stacks the deck with practically EVERYBODY in the film except the young sergent being against the War.......and even he is made to recant his position at the end.......where upon since he is obviously a drooling nazi hophead baby killer, is killed lest his evil infect the good liberal Masterson with his touch.Aside from the score---which is truly hideous--one cannot say the acting is bad. Huston as the smarmy Washington Post reporter has an impossible role.......and makes it work. Caan is good as is Jagger and the rest. And Jones could not give a bad performance if he wanted to. The film looks very nice visually but what sinks it ultimately is the script. Coppola simply does not have the integrity to even attempt a fair debate on the War.The film is not about the War, the abatoir in Indochina, the men who fought it......and in some cases were laid to eternal rest in Arlington having made the ultimate sacrifice for human freedom. It is not about the Old Guard. It is not about that Garden of Stone in Arlington and the men resting there. The film is not about what it pretends to be about.It is about a bunch of useful idiots and functional children who made a great big mess on the floor of the world stage and now want Daddy to make it all better and tell them it was not their fault.It is all very childish and petty.HOWEVER unlike THE KILLING FIELDS, they do not play IMAGINE at the end.See it or not.",1,Tolerant Liberals allow
