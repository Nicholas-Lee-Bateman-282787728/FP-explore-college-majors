Good love story if not a bit far fetched.The Blu Ray is top notch.  Colors are crisp.  There's only a few artificats that I noticed but for a 1997 film it looks really stunning.  The image is sharp and the blacks look great, which is a priority for this film because Cusack is in black for the entire film.Audio is perfect also.  Voices are centered proper and music and action sound great.Where this disc fails is in the extras.There are noneAt allBummer.So this gets 3 out of 5 stars.  It's not quite as epic fail for Disney as Color of Money because this film truly looks remastered.  But it was just such a looooong wait for it come out, wtf is this disc so slack on extras?  Come ON Disney.  Tell me you didn't throw out ALL of your archival footage, interviews, dailys, ANYTHING?  We don't even get a 15 min marketing featurette.  No galleries.  No retrospective interviews.. how fun would it be to hear Alan Arken or Jeremy Piven talk about their roles?  Hell a full cast commentary would have been perfect.It's almost like Disney doesn't care about their studio catalogue titles.

180511,A3BHHSORGTDW8K,1558908382,A customer,"[3, 3]","GREAT movie badly needing an upgraded DVD considering these current releases have so-so transfer and no meaningful bonus material.  Given the low cost of the present DVD however, if you haven't seen this movie it's still very much worth buying now.This black comedy about a young ex-CIA hitman for hire is a perfect vehicle to showcase John Cusack's talents. The world is changing, and as his character Martin Blank will tell you, countries no longer matter and people are more likely to be killed for corporate espionage and soda pop forumulas then political ideology.  When one of his targets says ""Whatever it is I'm doing, I'll stop"", Martin simply answers back ""It's nothing personal"". Although it's delivered tongue in cheek, Martin exhibits the type of ""moral flexibility"" that he also sees going on in the rest of the world, where market-driven globalization means more than patriotism to one's own country.Not that he's entirely OK with that, but the trips to his pyschiatrist seem to focus much more on nervousness about returning home to Michigan or philosophical bantering than worrying about who he just took out. He is just as likely to inject short, sardonic quips about nihlism then have long discussions on ammunition preference. Much of his dialogue comes forth in a fast, rapid style that seems like he's exchanging gunfire in a high stakes shootout. If overdone it could get annoying, but he seems to balance it just right.This is especially true when he deals with Dan Aykroyd's character, who plays a rival hitman bent on trying to unionize all assassins.  ""Will there be meetings?"", Martin asks. ""Of course!"", Aykroyd exclaims as the two continue to circle each other and mentally measure for body bags. Aykroyd talks even faster than Cusack, and when the two of them get going sometimes the one liners come faster than you can process them, kind of like listening to Robin Williams on stage where you find yourself finally laughing at the joke he told 5 minutes ago.When Martin goes back home to Michigan for his 10 year High School reunion he has to face several people who have no idea what he now does for a living, including old parents, old teachers, old friends, and old flames. Even when he tells the truth no one takes him seriously, including his buddy played by Jeremy Piven, in what many consider to be his break out role. Minnie Driver does an adequate job as the girl he jilted on prom-night to join the army, and Alan Arkin plays his reluctant psychiatrist in a great assassin/pyschotherapist relationship that both precedes and is better than the one done in ""Analyze That"". This is really a great supporting cast, and even Cusack's own sister has a couple scene stealers as his deranged secretary who sets up his clients for him, including the job he's given while back in Detroit.Folks from Michigan will especially like the movie, stocked with Detroit landmarks and Red Wings jerseys even though most of it was shot in Chicago and not Grosse Pointe. When he goes to visit his old childhood home and discovers it had been turned into a Quickie Mart, copius amounts of Stroh's beer and Faygo pop are quickly shot up. The rest of the world won't notice, but part of the changing globalization that Martin both dislikes yet embraces is typified by showing those fading regional brands as the McDonaldization of the world moves merrily along.They say you can't go back home, and as Martin proves there may no longer even be distinct homes to go back to anymore.  But you can make a fresh start in life and make a very funny and entertaining movie along the way.  And afterall, who doesn't want to kill a bad ass Czech assassin in front of your old highschool locker with a yearbook signing pen?",5,Deserves Blu-Ray edition !!!,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,3731,"['GREAT', 'movie', 'badly', 'needing', 'upgraded', 'DVD', 'considering', 'current', 'releases', 'have', 'so-so', 'transfer', 'meaningful', 'bonus', 'material', 'Given', 'low', 'cost', 'present', 'DVD', 'however', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'buying', 'now.This', 'black', 'comedy', 'young', 'ex-CIA', 'hitman', 'hire', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'showcase', 'John', 'Cusack', 'talents', 'world', 'changing', 'character', 'Martin', 'Blank', 'will', 'tell', 'countries', 'no', 'longer', 'matter', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'killed', 'corporate', 'espionage', 'soda', 'pop', 'forumulas', 'then', 'political', 'ideology', 'When', 'one', 'targets', ""'m"", 'doing', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'Martin', 'simply', 'back', 'nothing', 'personal', 'delivered', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'Martin', 'type', 'moral', 'flexibility', 'also', 'going', 'rest', 'world', 'where', 'market-driven', 'globalization', 'more', 'patriotism', 'one', 'own', 'country.Not', 'entirely', 'OK', 'trips', 'pyschiatrist', 'seem', 'focus', 'much', 'more', 'nervousness', 'returning', 'home', 'Michigan', 'philosophical', 'bantering', 'worrying', 'who', 'just', 'took', 'out', 'just', 'as', 'likely', 'inject', 'short', 'sardonic', 'quips', 'nihlism', 'then', 'have', 'long', 'discussions', 'ammunition', 'preference', 'Much', 'dialogue', 'forth', 'fast', 'rapid', 'style', 'exchanging', 'gunfire', 'high', 'stakes', 'shootout', 'overdone', 'could', 'get', 'annoying', 'balance', 'just', 'right.This', 'especially', 'true', 'when', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'character', 'who', 'rival', 'hitman', 'bent', 'trying', 'unionize', 'assassins', 'Will', 'be', 'meetings', 'Martin', 'course', 'Aykroyd', 'two', 'continue', 'circle', 'other', 'mentally', 'measure', 'body', 'bags', 'Aykroyd', 'talks', 'even', 'faster', 'Cusack', 'when', 'two', 'get', 'going', 'sometimes', 'one', 'come', 'faster', 'can', 'process', 'kind', 'like', 'listening', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'stage', 'where', 'find', 'finally', 'laughing', 'joke', 'told', '5', 'minutes', 'ago.When', 'Martin', 'back', 'home', 'Michigan', '10', 'year', 'High', 'School', 'reunion', 'face', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'now', 'living', 'including', 'old', 'parents', 'old', 'teachers', 'old', 'friends', 'old', 'flames', 'Even', 'when', 'truth', 'one', 'seriously', 'including', 'buddy', 'played', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'what', 'many', 'consider', 'be', 'break', 'out', 'role', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'adequate', 'job', 'girl', 'jilted', 'prom-night', 'join', 'army', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'reluctant', 'psychiatrist', 'great', 'assassin/pyschotherapist', 'relationship', 'precedes', 'better', 'one', 'done', 'Analyze', 'really', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'even', 'Cusack', 'own', 'sister', 'couple', 'scene', 'stealers', 'deranged', 'secretary', 'who', 'up', 'clients', 'including', 'job', 'given', 'back', 'Detroit.Folks', 'Michigan', 'will', 'especially', 'movie', 'stocked', 'Detroit', 'landmarks', 'Red', 'Wings', 'jerseys', 'even', 'most', 'was', 'shot', 'Chicago', 'not', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'When', 'visit', 'old', 'childhood', 'home', 'discovers', 'had', 'been', 'turned', 'Quickie', 'Mart', 'copius', 'amounts', 'Stroh', 'beer', 'Faygo', 'pop', 'are', 'quickly', 'shot', 'up', 'rest', 'world', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'part', 'changing', 'globalization', 'Martin', 'dislikes', 'yet', 'embraces', 'typified', 'showing', 'fading', 'regional', 'brands', 'McDonaldization', 'world', 'merrily', 'along.They', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'home', 'Martin', 'may', 'no', 'longer', 'even', 'be', 'distinct', 'homes', 'go', 'back', 'anymore', 'can', 'make', 'fresh', 'start', 'life', 'make', 'very', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'way', 'afterall', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'kill', 'bad', 'ass', 'Czech', 'assassin', 'front', 'old', 'highschool', 'locker', 'yearbook', 'signing', 'pen']",Grosse Pointe Blank

It's an absurd, demented role that fits Ackroyd like a glove.- Jeremy Piven turns in his usual solid stuff as Cusack's high school buddy (okay, not much of a stretch there, but no one does these roles like Piven).- And, of course, Joan Cusack is her usual hilarious self as Cusack's Admin.The delight of the movie is the delicious satire of wrapping the most non-professional of all ""professions"" (hitman) in the trappings of the modern world.

Martin Blank (Cusack) is a contract killer having a bout of emptiness.  His secretary (played superbly by sister Joan Cusack) corralls him into heading home just in time for his 10-year high school reunion.  Who is he afraid to see there, another killer or fellow cronie?  No, it's his high school prom date Minnie Driver!  (Speaking of cronies, though, Dan Aykroid plays one of his best roles ever as Grocer, the competing hitman trying to form a 'union' of sorts).From the reminiscing with old friends, to the rekindling of a relationship, to the way the town has changed, and to the current contract in Grosse Pointe, this truly dark comedy deliver big time with dry one-liners, clever and witty banter, odd and embarassing situations, and a visit back to high school days and faces once forgotten.  Anyone who has even run into an old classmate from school will definitely find this movie hilarious and poignant.  The soundtrack is also outstanding featuring many of the hits from the mid-80s and worked in cleverly into the plot and scenes.  (Keep an ear/eye open for Queen's ""Under Pressure"" and the way the lyrics and the movie itself seem to marry perfectly).(Disclaimer: for those of you who might be concerned, there is a good deal of foul language, some violent scenes, and minor sexual situations.  Otherwise, if that doesn't bother you much, definitely one to add to your collection).Overall, a tremendous movie with great action, universal themes of reunion along with the related phobias and hijinx, hilarious wit, and excellent acting all around.

It's about a hit man, Martin Blank (John Cusack) who returns to his hometown of Grosse Pointe for his high school reunion.  There he meets up with an ex-girlfriend (Minnie Driver)  who he ditched at the prom ten years ago and hasn't seen since.  At the  same time, a competing professional killer (played by Dan Ackroyd) has put  a hit out on Martin, because he refuses to join up with him.  So Martin's  always looking over his shoulder.  Occasionally he phones his shrink (Alan  Arkin) for advice.If you haven't already guessed, &quot;Grosse Pointe  Blank&quot; is a comedy.  This is the kind of movie where people don't  connect very well, so when Martin is inevitably asked what he does and he  answers honestly, &quot;professional killer&quot;, it doesn't even register  - everyone's so self-involved.  John Cusack (who was terrific in &quot;The  Grifters&quot; - a much better film) is appealing, though, in a cool sort  of way.  It's directed by George Armitage, who did &quot;Miami Blues&quot;  a while back - a film I also liked.  And there's a hip soundtrack that  features Violent Femmes, The Clash, and The Specials among others.You  might want to give it a try on video.

Martin Blank (Cusack) is tired of his job as a hit man. He's finding that life as a semi-sociopathic killer-for-hire just ain't what it used to be. His terrified therapist (Alan Arkin) is no help at all. Mr. Blank's salvation arrives in the form of an invitation to his 10 year highschool reunion. At first he doesn't want to go, even though he's got a hit to perform in the same locale. After all, what would he have to say to all those former classmates? Plus, he'd have to face the girl he stood up on prom night (Driver)! GPB is not your typical love story. I was wide-eyed during the explosion, gun battles, and karate sequence, while at the same time admiring the cuteness of the Cusack / Driver coupling! I kept saying, &quot;Aw, they really need each other!&quot; throughout the death and destruction. I have never seen a movie that is able to balance the action, romance, and (jet black) comedic elements the way this one does. Check out Dan Aykroyd as the rival hit man, obsessed with either getting Blank to join his new hit man's union (&quot;it's more like a club&quot;) or killing him.

Blank (John Cusack) going back to Grosse Pointe for his 10-year High School Reunion. His psychiatrist Dr. Oatman (Alan Arkin) refuses to treat him because he is afraid of him, but he persists in calling him, and uses him for a reluctant sounding board for his own ideas about his therapy:---------------------------[Talking to his psychiatrist about going to his high school reunion]Marty: They all have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs, and, you know, they've all made themselves a part of something and they can talk about what they do. What am I gonna say? ""I killed the president of Paraguay with a fork. How've you been?""=================================================The real reason he is going to the reunion is actually so he can reconnect with his High School sweetheart, Debi (Minnie Driver):----------------------Debi: Okay. So. You're back... a decade late, and... you're on some sort of therapeutic assignment, and you want to sort things out with me. So the question now becomes, do I allow you access to me or... do I call security?Marty: I don't think that'd be a good idea.=======================================Miss Driver is cute and appealing, and she is especially good with quips. Not only do they meet cute, the cuteness continues non-stop, a veritable cavalcade of cuteness:--------------------------------------------Debi: So, is there a Mrs. Mysterio?Martin Q. Blank: No, but I do have a very nice cat?Debi: Not the same.Martin Q. Blank: Well, you don't know my cat, it's very demanding.Debi: It? You don't know if it's a boy or girl?Martin Q. Blank: I respect its privacy.====================================================================Enough already, with the cutie cute cuteness. How about some substance, some epiphany, some revelation:---------------------Debi: You know what you need?Marty: What?Debi: Shakabuku.Marty: You wanna tell me what that means?Debi: It's a swift, spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.Marty: Oh, that'd be good. I think.===========================================It is kind of a dark comedy, with the juxtaposition of killing for a living with a High School reunion scenario. It is kind of a romantic comedy, with the screw ball reason that the two crazy kids can't be together the fact that he is a professional hitman. Neither of these two kinds of comedies really work for me here. I think that the people who want to see John Cusack are not the same demographic who want to see lots of shooting and things blowing up. The people who want to see that aren't the ones who want to see romantic comedies, not even dark comedies. And they certainly aren't interested in a lot of clever dialogue. And the people who do want to hear clever dialogue don't want to watch a lot of people being shot and see things blowing up.Maybe John Cusack wanted to make a film like this to see how it feels to be an action hero. Maybe he thought it would pull in fans of different genres. 'Grosse Pointe Blank' isn't a bad movie, and it is quite entertaining, but it just doesn't quite cut it for me. As Bob said at the High School reunion, ""I'm drawing a complete....Blank.""Anyway, Debi is a DJ, which gives the filmmakers an opportunity to shower us with soundtrack cuts galore. It is like they just wanted to pay homage to the 80's, and how much better the music was than during the 90's. This is actually the best part of the movie. Joe Strummer wrote some music for the soundtrack, and there is also a lot of The Clash and other great music from the 80's:Violent Femmes""Blister in the Sun""Written by Gordon GanoPerformed by Violent FemmesCourtesy of Slash/London Records, Ltd.By Arrangement with PolyGram Film & TV LicensingSuper Black Market Clash""Armagideon Time""Written by Clement Dodd and Willie WilliamsPerformed by The ClashCourtesy of Epic RecordsBy Arrangement with Sony Music LicensingLive & Let Die""Live and Let Die""Written by Paul McCartney & Linda McCartneyPerformed by Guns N' RosesCourtesy of Geffen RecordsBy Arrangement with MCA Special Markets & Products(""Live and Let Die"" segues into a 'muzak' version performed by Adam Fields)The Jam - The Complete Jam""Absolute Beginners""Written by Paul WellerPerformed by The JamCourtesy of Polydor LimitedBy Arrangement with PolyGram Film & TV LicensingToday's Specials""Pressure Drop""Written by Toots Hibbert (as Frederick Hibbert)Performed by The SpecialsCourtesy of Kuff Records Ltd./Virgin Records America, Inc.Ace of Spades""Ace of Spades""Written by Lemmy (as Ian Kilmister), Fast Eddie Clarke (as Edward Clarke) and Phil 'Philthy Animal' Taylor (as Philip Taylor)Performed by Mot&ouml;rheadCourtesy of Castle Copyrights, Ltd.The Head on the Door""In Between Days""Written by Robert SmithPerformed by The CureCourtesy of Elektra Entertainment Corp.By Arrangement with Warner Special Products; and Courtesy of Fiction Records/Polydor Ltd./Elektra Entertainment Ltd.By Arrangement with PolyGram Film & TV LicensingIntroduce Yourself""We Care a Lot""Written by Chuck Mosely, Roddy Bottum, Billy Gould (as William Gould),Mike Bordin and Jim MartinPerformed by Faith No MoreCourtesy of Slash/London Records, Ltd.By Arrangement with PolyGram Film & TV LicensingMessage From Beat Street: Best Of""White Lines""Written by Sylvia Robinson and Melle Mel (as Melvin Glover)Performed by Melle Mel (as Grandmaster Melle Mel)Courtesy of Rhino Records/Castle Copyrights Ltd.Hot Space""Under Pressure""Written by David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, Roger Taylor, John Deacon and Brian MayPerformed by David Bowie (with Queen)Courtesy of Raincloud Productions Ltd./David R.

180533,A35IYKFDG1LUZ3,1558908382,"CD Harris ""Amuk""","[4, 4]","Comedies of any sort generally have a short half-life with me. Once you've  seen the gags, they don't usually bear repeated viewings. So, when I find  one of those rare comedies that's still watchable and enjoyable after the  third or fourth time I see it, I know it's a keeper.And Grosse Pointe  Blank is definitely a keeper. Black comedy with some verve is very, very  hard to do well, but here the hard thing to do is find a flaw. The  characters are interesting and don't act in predictable ways. The casting  is right on (I even liked Minnie Driver in this and I usually don't much  care for her). Everyone plays their role with just the right level of  intensity - it would have been very easy to overdo this (Dan Ackroyd,  especially, could have gone totally overboard but instead he plays a very  disturbed person just so, and we end up believing him; in less talented  hands, that character would have been a mess).

180535,A3RRBPUGD7UOSP,1558908382,"chemikalguy ""chemikalguy""","[3, 3]","This is, for me anyway, the best film Cusack has done. It's filled with a certain realism that you don't find in many films. This is odd because the film is primarily a comedy. Black comedy, mind you, but comedy nonetheless.Background - Martin Blank (Cusack) is a contract hit-man ten years after his high school graduation. He's lost his taste for 'the business' and wants out. He received an invite to his high school reunion but doesn't initially want to attend. Almost simultaneously, he gets a contract to take out someone in his home town. He decides to kill two birds with one stone and do both. Little does he know that a contract has been put out on him as well.Story - Blank freaked out at the end of high school and joined the army where he learned to kill. He was loaned out to the CIA where he served as a hit-man before going solo. After ten years of the stuff, he's had his fill and wants out. A fellow hit-man (Dan Aykroyd) Grosser, wants to form a 'Hit-man union' of sorts. Blank declines, so Grosser puts a contract out on him. The film follows Blank as he seeks out his high school sweetheart, avoids assassination attempts, and tries to complete his last hit, which has an interesting twist.Why I like this film - The conversations Cusack has with the other characters, as well as with himself, are priceless. The dialog is disjointed, much like a real conversation you might have.Another thing that I liked was the realism of the fight scenes. I'm tired of watching movie fights where the hero and villains trade punches to the face, and neither of them have any blood on them. In one scene in particular, the fight lasts all of a minute (pretty real for a streetfight) and both characters as bloodies and sweating profusely. Very realistic, indeed.This film is not for people who don't like action, as it's filled with it. Younger children probably shouldn't watch it either because of the excessive violence.

Lots of folks  remember him from &quot;say anything,&quot; but my admiration goes back a  year before that, to John Sayles's &quot;Eight Men Out.&quot;  There was a  lot to like in that movie, especially the outstanding cast (from David  Strathairn to John Mahoney, not to mention Studs Terkel and Sayles  himself), but as the emotional center of the plot, the relatively unknown  Cusack blew everyone out of the water.  It's been great to see him grow,  from &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; and &quot;City Hall&quot; to  &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; and &quot;The Thin Red Line.&quot;What  is especially amazing about Cusack, especially in this role as a  professional killer at the center of a romantic comedy, is that he never  looks like he's WORKING HARD.

Fans will probably find his portrayal of a whimsical professional hit man a nice departure for the accomplished and sensitive actor.I would too except I just couldn't get over the disconnect between the sweet personality and the amoral nature of his character.  Of course this is a comedy, indeed a satire and burlesque of hit man films with shootouts (two guns ablazing) and car chases aplenty.There is also a romance between ex-highschool sweethearts Martin Q. Blank (Cusack) and Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), and they seem nicely paired.  The story is framed around Blank's disappearance on prom night ten years previous and his sudden and unexpected return on the eve of his ten-year class reunion at Grosse Pointe (Michigan) High School.  His ""profession"" is so unlikely that he can be candid about it and nobody will believe him.  ""I'm a professional killer.""  ""Nice.  I'm glad that's working out for you."" (Okay, I made up that dialogue, but it's close to what's really said.)Dan Aykroyd gives comedic support in an over-the-top portrayal of a rival hit man always making with the jokes even as the bullets fly.  Funny too with a lot of original shtick is John Cusack's sister, Joan Cusack, as the hit man's strange but conscientious secretary, Marcella.  Alan Arkin has a modest part as Dr. Oatman, Blank's frightened shrink--frightened because he knows what Blank does for a living.Bottom line: a bonafide cult classic with repeat viewing appeal that may not work for all audiences.",3,"Yeah, it's point blank gross in parts",1092528000,"08 15, 2004",2004,1647,"['main', 'feature', 'movie', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'John', 'Cusack', 'who', 'having', 'lot', 'fun', 'quirky', 'story', 'quirkily', 'done', 'Fans', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'portrayal', 'whimsical', 'professional', 'hit', 'man', 'nice', 'departure', 'accomplished', 'sensitive', 'actor.I', 'would', 'too', 'except', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'disconnect', 'sweet', 'personality', 'amoral', 'nature', 'character', 'course', 'comedy', 'indeed', 'satire', 'burlesque', 'hit', 'man', 'films', 'shootouts', 'two', 'guns', 'ablazing', 'car', 'chases', 'aplenty.There', 'also', 'romance', 'ex-highschool', 'sweethearts', 'Martin', 'Q.', 'Blank', 'Cusack', 'Debi', 'Newberry', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'seem', 'nicely', 'paired', 'story', 'framed', 'Blank', 'disappearance', 'prom', 'night', 'ten', 'years', 'previous', 'sudden', 'unexpected', 'return', 'eve', 'ten-year', 'class', 'reunion', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Michigan', 'High', 'School', 'profession', 'so', 'unlikely', 'can', 'be', 'candid', 'nobody', 'will', 'believe', ""'m"", 'professional', 'killer', 'Nice', ""'m"", 'glad', 'working', 'out', 'Okay', 'made', 'up', 'dialogue', 'close', 'what', 'really', 'said', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'comedic', 'support', 'over-the-top', 'portrayal', 'rival', 'hit', 'man', 'always', 'making', 'jokes', 'even', 'bullets', 'fly', 'Funny', 'too', 'lot', 'original', 'shtick', 'John', 'Cusack', 'sister', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'hit', 'man', 'strange', 'conscientious', 'secretary', 'Marcella', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'modest', 'part', 'Dr.', 'Oatman', 'Blank', 'frightened', 'shrink', 'frightened', 'what', 'Blank', 'living.Bottom', 'line', 'bonafide', 'cult', 'classic', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'appeal', 'may', 'not', 'work', 'audiences']",Grosse Pointe Blank

I became a fan of his during the early teen-comedy days of 'Better off Dead' and 'The Sure Thing', but this actor is a future Oscar-winner, just wait and see!The film follows the high school reunion dilemma of Cusack's character, Martin Blank, who has to balance his desire to return to his home town of Grosse Point and meet his old girlfriend, with his unconventional dayjob of professional hitman. Minnie Driver plays the love interest, and the other cast members provide able support - and yes, this even applies to Dan Ackroyd!The movie works so well because we like most of the characters in it! Cusack's character is obviously disfunctional, and the early scenes with his adopted psychiatrist Alan Arkin are hysterical. The scenes with his real-life sister Joan, all held over the phone, also are played mostly for laughs, as she arranges his next 'job' as if it were the most normal thing in the world. And yet at the heart of this there lies a story of unrequited love, and therin lies its soul.The violence in the film is slickly done, and not over-glamourised, apart from the action-comedy fest that is the store shoot-out scene, where the store attendant plays out his fantasy violence on a video game while behind him all hell is breaking loose for real. It also features quite possibly the most realistic martial arts fight scene ever committed to celluloid as Cusack has to fight for his life in the corridor of his old school with a rival hitman sent to kill him. Joe Pesci's imaginative use for a pen in 'Casino' is re-visited here, so be warned!However the film as a whole is more than the sum of it's parts. It features little observations of how we all change, and I'm sure anyone who has ever been to their own reunion will recognise characters in the film from their own lives.

Given the wide variety of reviews related to the PQ I was a little nervous about picking this one up. Grosse Point Blank is an all-time favorite film of mine and holds up extremely well on repeat viewings.I actually saw this in theatres when it first came out. Since I also view films on a very large format screen, nothing gets by me very easy. I had an opportunity to view this over the holidays on a family members 106"" DaLite screen opposed to my usual 92"". I must say the PQ was very good! I felt like I was watching a print; not video. I couldn't disagree more with any negative reviews of the PQ. I respect the opinions, but it certainly wasn't the experience I had thankfully. I sat about 15 feet back from the 106"" screen. I noticed a few specks and scratches here and there, but nothing too egregious. I did notice some light ringing in scene or two. The only reason I caught that was because I was scrutinizing it very closely given some of the very harsh reviews I have read related to the PQ. The other thing that I find amusing is the fact that the DVD release of this film is non-anamorphic! You can't even seriously compare the DVD to the BD release of this film! LOL! The BD blows it away! I threw in the DVD first and watched it for awhile to see if I would notice a difference and when I put the BD in there was no comparison. I have seen some crappy BD's, but this isn't one of them. Batman Begins comes to mind. The PQ on that BD was very disappointing in many scenes.

But Martin quickly discovers that he is being tailed not only by two Federal Agents, but also a rival hitman named Grocer (Aykroyd) who wants to start a cartel for hitmen and will take out anyone that gets in his way, and another hitman hired to take him out for revenge for one of his past jobs.The soundtrack to Grosse Pointe Blank is filled with hit songs from the 1980s such as ""Blister in the Sun"" by Violent Femmes, ""Under Pressure"" by Queen and David Bowie, and Guns N' Roses cover of the classic ""Live and Let Die.""Grosse Pointe Blank is rated R due to violence and strong language, so I wouldn't recommend watching this movie with young children, but it is an enjoyable date night movie.",4,Grosse Pointe Blank is an enjoyable date night movie.,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,1575,"['Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'dark', 'comedy', 'themes', 'such', 'examining', 'one', 'own', 'mortality', 'how', 'far', 'man', 'morals', 'will', 'let', 'go', 'redemptive', 'power', 'love', 'movie', 'masterfully', 'combine', 'elements', 'traditional', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'enough', 'action', 'satisfy', 'seeking', 'thrill', 'shoot-em', 'up', 'buddy', 'comedy', 'Gross', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd.Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'movie', 'hit', 'man', 'beginning', 'lose', 'touch', 'passion', 'work', '10', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'approaches', 'Martin', 'Blank', 'Cusack', 'hometown', '10', 'years', 'job', 'eliminate', 'someone', 'smooth', 'over', 'earlier', 'botched', 'hit', 'way', 'reunite', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Debi', 'Driver', 'up', 'best', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'Paul', 'Piven', 'Martin', 'quickly', 'being', 'tailed', 'not', 'only', 'two', 'Federal', 'Agents', 'also', 'rival', 'hitman', 'named', 'Grocer', 'Aykroyd', 'who', 'start', 'cartel', 'hitmen', 'will', 'take', 'out', 'anyone', 'way', 'hitman', 'hired', 'take', 'out', 'revenge', 'one', 'past', 'jobs.The', 'soundtrack', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'filled', 'hit', 'songs', '1980s', 'such', 'Blister', 'Sun', 'Violent', 'Femmes', 'Pressure', 'Queen', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Guns', 'N', 'Roses', 'cover', 'classic', 'Live', 'Let', 'Die', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'rated', 'R', 'due', 'violence', 'strong', 'language', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'young', 'children', 'enjoyable', 'date', 'night', 'movie']",Grosse Pointe Blank

(20th Anniversary Edition)andThe Sure Thing (Special Edition)and GROSSE POINTE BLANK are always jockeying for top honors as my all-time favorite John Cusack picture. Should I have a yen for a John Hughes type of film, then the first two films above tend to inch ahead. But if I'm craving something more subversive, then I must roll with GROSSE POINTE BLANK. John Cusack may have cornered the market on those intelligent everyman roles. He's always presented this impression that complicated gears are always whirring around in his skull. In GROSSE POINTE BLANK, a freakin' delicious black comedy, Cusack's internal conflict has never been more pronounced.Martin Blank is a burnt-out hit man, and maybe his moral flexibility has at last reached that snapping point. Martin has just botched his last kill. One could tell his heart wasn't in it. His employers are cheesed, royally so. He's given one chance to atone. Accordingly, the next job takes him to his hometown of Detroit.Martin isn't one for nostalgia. Still, there's that pang of curiosity when he learns of his impending tenth year high school reunion (Class of '86, huzzah!). Check this: Martin Blank is touted as ""Detroit's Most Famous Disappearing Act,"" given that the last anyone had seen of him, he was standing up Debi Newberry on prom night. Down the years, people assumed that he either got murdered or brainwashed or had joined a cult. You'd think it'd be a bit late (and unprofessional) for Martin Blank to develop angst, and yet there it is. In Detroit he can't help but hearken back, and especially hearken back to Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver) who today is a popular radio DJ. She's not afraid to call him out on his past transgressions.In Detroit, Martin's personal life intrudes into his professional one. And, yeah, maybe it's hard to keep your eyes on the prize when you visit your old home only to find out that it's been torn down and replaced with a homogeneous convenience store. An exasperated (yet philosophical) Martin reflects: ""You can never go home again... but you can shop there."" Lest you think this movie fixates too much on angsty navel-gazing, know that there's ample action to rev up the pace. Martin's Detroit assignment isn't as by the numbers as he'd assumed, not with his rival, Mr. Grocer (Dan Ackroyd), so violently intent on poaching the kill contract. Goes to show, the murder game is such a competitive field. In fact, someone in the film refers to it as a ""growth industry."" Heh. By the way, it's pretty nifty seeing Ackroyd switch things up and get all sinister. Still, the action highlight has to be Cusack's hallway death match with legendary martial artist Benny ""the Jet"" Urquidez. It's just cool to see Cusack in a brutal, drag-out fight, even though, okay, the more advanced moves were probably performed by a stunt double.Minnie Driver has never been more appealing, and she's got great chemistry with Cusack, and her Yank accent is again impeccable. Their interactions make for some stand-out moments. But then again I find that Cusack has great chemistry with everyone onscreen. His scenes with Ackroyd are marvelous, and I have to reiterate how pleased I was at Ackroyd's unexpected and very effective turn as the big bad. Cusack's real-life sister, Joan, has a nifty bit part as his assistant Marcella. I am become jaded at her history of excellent scene-stealing. I love how she takes these roles that could have been these unassuming roles and steers them down unexpected avenues. Lastly, Alan Arkin made me laugh out loud each time he was onscreen here. He plays Cusack's very, very nervous psychiatrist who finds himself constantly walking on eggshells during their sessions.John Cusack anchors this thing. He's one of the few really interesting and quirky actors out there today whose movies I'll check out even if, going in, I don't what they're about. He's surpassed Tom Hanks as my favorite contemporary actor some time ago. I love the innate intelligence and the casual humor and the wry, detached approach he applies. It's fascinating watching Cusack work and how he manifests his internal process by virtue of body language and a repertoire of revealing expressions and by nuanced (yet deadpan) intonation. I don't know that there's anyone else out there who can better articulate the role of an assassin-for-hire who develops a conscience. John Cusack can play just about anything, except an idiot. I don't think he knows how to do that.",5,"""I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork.

After a stint in the military, he found he had a very unique talent: he is very good at killing people. He's made a very good living, but he is tired of the pressures of his profession (apparently there is a lot of competition in the hit man industry).

Naturally, a hit man can't return to his high school reunion with out some kind of high jinks ensuing.This movie is wildly original and funny, sometimes over the top, but always entertaining.

A professional hitman returns to his hometown to &quot;do a job&quot; and, while he's there, attend his 10 year highschool reunion.  John Cusack plays the role well, charming and  remarkably likeable, despite his profession.  This &quot;dark comedy&quot;  is very clever, and I rate it as one my favorite 90's films.Too bad  the DVD isn't up to par.  It has next to zero extras.  But even that could  be passable if the picture was good.  First of all, the movie is  non-anamorphic.  That doesn't make a difference unless you have a 16x9  television, it'll look the same on a regular tv, it's just a pet peeve of  mine.

When was the last time Dan Ackroyd made you laugh? Now I confess I am the perfect target market for this movie. I am in the age range where I think the soundtrack is cool and the eighties were a pretty good time. Nowadays of course many people look back on the eighties with rose-colored glasses. Back when teens could be teens without ending up on MSNBC. Back before cell phones let parents track our movements and school security consisted of a bald vice principle with an attitude problem.The movie is well cast with John Cusack as a professional hit man going to his 10 year high school reunion and Minnie Driver as the girl he left behind. A great supporting cast includes Alan Arkin as a therapist unhappy with a killer for a client (Years before the Sopranos or Analyze This) . The aforementioned Dan Aykroyd as a competing hit man and Joan Cusack as the secretary that both cares and is insane.The story is very silly and over the top, yet Gross Pointe Blank somehow manages to keep the tone just right throughout the proceedings.

Grosse Pointe Blank sets you up with the obvious comedic ploy of a hitman returning to his high-school reunion, but that's where the obvious stops.The movie is about Cusack's character coming to grips with emotion.  Not his emotions necessarily but emotion as a concept, and how it pertains to reality.  He feels it nagging at himself but is unsure or unwilling to admit what it is.  His homecoming is a return to where he left that part of himself behind.Cusack's character begins to see himself as justified as he keeps running into people and situations that illustrate the absurdities of everyday &quot;normal&quot; life.  Through his old girlfriend and a few others, however, he begins to see the importance of connecting with people.The ending device is rather contrived, but it was really the only way to advance the plot, and very very few movies can hope to escape some contrived story element to make a movie a contained package.Grosse Pointe Blank has just enough ethical conflict, humor, action, and intelligence to make it a very entertaining movie without bogging itself down in anyone of the above too much.",5,A very funny movie,1046736000,"03 4, 2003",2003,1210,"['One', 'few', 'comedies', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'being', 'spoon-fed', 'joke', 'joke', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'sets', 'up', 'obvious', 'comedic', 'ploy', 'hitman', 'returning', 'high-school', 'reunion', 'where', 'obvious', 'stops.The', 'movie', 'Cusack', 'character', 'coming', 'grips', 'emotion', 'Not', 'emotions', 'necessarily', 'emotion', 'concept', 'how', 'reality', 'nagging', 'unsure', 'unwilling', 'admit', 'what', 'homecoming', 'return', 'where', 'left', 'part', 'behind.Cusack', 'character', 'see', 'as', 'justified', 'running', 'people', 'situations', 'illustrate', 'absurdities', 'everyday', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'life', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'few', 'others', 'however', 'see', 'importance', 'connecting', 'people.The', 'ending', 'device', 'rather', 'contrived', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'way', 'advance', 'plot', 'very', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'can', 'hope', 'escape', 'contrived', 'story', 'element', 'make', 'movie', 'contained', 'package.Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'just', 'enough', 'ethical', 'conflict', 'humor', 'action', 'intelligence', 'make', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'bogging', 'down', 'anyone', 'above', 'too', 'much']",Grosse Pointe Blank

He sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Oatman (Alan Arkin), who, once he becomes aware of his patient's profession, wants nothing more to do with him. Moreover, a most unlikely, rival hit man (Dan Ackroyd) is on his tail, looking to clear the field of a potential rival.What's a conflicted hit man to do? Why go to his tenth year high school reunion in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, of course. There, ""Marty"" plans to do his final hit and hook up with his high school sweetheart, Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), whom he unceremoniously stood up on prom night, ten years earlier. Once he gets there, however, things do not go according to plan, and ""Marty"" is in store for a few surprises.John Cusack is terrific as the hit man, playing him with just the right blend of sangfroid cool and, at other times, with all the charm of the boy next door.

180581,A2VG8F8TL6AYDR,1558908382,"""lexo-2""","[6, 6]","Those of us who review films on sites like this often feel (or at least I imagine we do) that we should be awarding five stars to movies we think are all-time classics, like Bresson's &quot;Pickpocket&quot; or Godard's  &quot;Le Mepris&quot;.  And yet, when we look into our hearts and ask  ourselves what films we'd actually like to pull out and watch of an  evening, we (or at least I) tend to find that the films we really love are  of quite a different kidney.  Like this one.I went to see this in the  cinema with my quondam girlfriend when we were both in a bad mood and  suffering from various non-relationship-related troubles.  We walked out a  couple of hours later feeling cleansed, relaxed, happy and just that bit  much more in love with each other.  You wouldn't think that a romantic  comedy about a professional killer could have that effect on people, but it  can.  I (we) am (are) living proof.This film masquerades as a cool, flip  comedy about Martin Blank (Cusack), dead-eyed hitman, and his return to his  home town for his high school reunion, during which he meets the former  love of his life, Debi Newberry (Driver).  It's actually a  military-industrial grade stress-test of the human capacity for love and  renewal.  The comedy arises from that late-twenties feeling that you wish  you could return to your past with a genuine sense that you've done  something amazing in the meantime.  Martin actually has, in that he's  killed loads of people.  Throughout the film, Cusack is constantly  informing people that he's a professional killer, and they refuse to  believe him.  He struggles towards some sort of budget-priced redemption  whilst being trailed by a psychopathic Basque terrorist (named La Poubelle,  which means &quot;dustbin&quot; for non-French-speakers), two bumbling  government spooks and an even more amoral rival hitman (Dan Aykroyd in  sleaziest form).  It's more than just a comedy, and I'm aware that I'm  coming across as a Kevin Smith character here - it's a work of blooming  art.Confession: an American friend of mine worked in John Cusack's  theatre company New Crime so I am perhaps biased in favour of this  effortlessly hippest and sharpest of actors.  But when you look at the 80s  teen comedies that he helped to carry, they stand up quite a bit better  than many of the other ones out at the time; and he continues to be  involved in class stuff.  More power to him.Riddled with  oh-so-nostalgic 80s hits (nostalgic at least for those of us who grew up  during that uniquely repellent decade), there isn't a single minor  character who isn't beautifully sketched.  The cast is fantastic (Minnie  Driver is as luscious as ever and is thoroughly convincing for such a nice  English girl, Joan Cusack is wonderfully droll as her real-life brother's  worried secretary, Jeremy Piven is a splendid sidekick and Alan Arkin does  a lovely turn as Martin's terrified shrink) and the dialogue is as crisp as  fresh lettuce.  The only slight problem is a broad range of sound level;  it's hard to catch every line unless you turn the volume up really loud.  But otherwise, a fab movie, and George Armitage's best work since the  notably funky &quot;Miami Blues&quot;, which is one of the few films  (besides &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;) to unleash the malevolent genius  of Alec Baldwin.  Watch it with a partner, a bottle of good Scotch (if you  happen to indulge) and a prestige snack of your choosing.",5,This film can change your life!

180587,A129YBX5BVNW2,1558908382,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 1]","About to assassinate a low-life on a bicycle - Martin Blank points his high-powered rifle, scope and silencer out the elevated open window of his hotel room at his mark - but then gets an interesting phone call on his headset from his handler Marcella. She's just opened a letter that has tickled her pink. As Martin takes aim - she reads out an invite to all alumni from the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe - the class of 1986 is having a high school reunion dinner and dance - and he's invited. Marcella helpfully suggests that this would be an excellent chance to renew old friendships - maybe open up some new accounts - even meet with that Debi girl he's been obsessing over for 10 years - the cute one he left stranded in a $700 Prom Dress... But unscrewing his silencer after a rival assassin with huge handguns has mowed down his clients on the footpath opposite and thereby snafued his corporate assignment - Martin tells Marcella to shred it and heads off to his shrink Dr. Oatman to discuss the pros and cons of his 'rarified profession'...What makes ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" so incredibly fresh and funny is the double-whammy of a brilliant script and a perfectly picked cast. John Cusack is ideal as the matter-of-fact contract killer Martin Black (who won't kill Greenpeace activists or dogs), Joan Cusack (John's real life sister) as his ballsy secretary Marcella and the luminously gorgeous Minnie Driver as the love interest. Thrown into this double-crossing mess is Dan Akyroyd - in stunning form as Grocer - another hyper assassin who wants to form a co-op of killers to avoid embarrassing overlaps in their busy slaughter schedule (""Make some money...killing important people...what'd ya say!"").Then there's Alan Arkin in fabulous frowning deadpan therapist mode (""Have you ever thought of not killing people!""), Jeremy Piven as a high school buddy who lusts after a woman he can't have (""Ten years man!"") and Hank Azaria as a gleeful CIA operative who doesn't care what bad guy he shoots as long as he's the 'good guy' doing it. Piven would in fact later play Cusack's best buddy again in ""Serendipity"" (see separate review for the BLU RAY). And amidst all the explosions and mayhem are rapid-fire discussions about the latest vitamin supplements in cafes as each hides a gun in brown paper bags - worry about the overcrowded marketplace in hired killers - affectionate chats on The Pilipino Dwarf Sisters (""Queens of the hotel hit!"") - endless seeking of answers from Martin's weary shrink about his 'problem' - it's all so bloody good and gigglesome funny.The overall soundtrack is by Joe Strummer of The Clash - with perfectly placed tunes in-between like Guns `N Roses incendiary cover of McCartney's James Bond theme ""Live And Let Die"" as Martin steps out of his car to find his home has been bulldozed and replaced with a UNIMART CONVENIENCE STORE. DJ Debi (Minnie Driver) from the local town radio station WGPM plays The Specials ""Ghost Town"" as Martin drives around Grosse Pointe wondering where his past has gone (his mother is in a nuthouse and his father has drunk himself into a whiskey grave). But just maybe he can form a lasting relationship on this weird trip and actually enjoy a life that doesn't involve suitcases full of knives, semi-automatics and poison kits... Like the lovely and forgiving Debi says - maybe all he needs is ""a quick spiritual kick to the head...""The Hollywood Pictures 15th Anniversary Edition on BLU RAY boasts a truly gorgeous remastered print that is defaulted to Full Aspect (no lines top or bottom) and this US title is REGION ABC - so plays on UK and European machines as well as all others.

DeVincentis, Steve Pink and John Cusack - and Directed by George Armitage - I saw ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" at the cinema in 1997 and remember the audience loving it to bits - clapping the credits as they rolled up on screen.

Usually even below-par releases have at least some redeeming quality to them, but unfortunately not in this case as far as the picture quality is concerned.

180595,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,1558908382,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[0, 0]","A fun, dark comedy about a hitman who has to do a job in his hometown and also decides to go to his 10 year high school reunion. The problem is that nobody has been in contact with him for those ten years, including a prom date he left hanging, a good friend who now sells real estate and several other people from his high school days, including his parents. It almost feels as if this role was written for Cusack as he falls into it so easily. Dan Akroyd plays his assassin opponent who wants him to join the newly formed union or die so that they can regulate business. Toss in the FBI and some other hit men and you've got yourself a lot of good movie moments. The gunfights will sometimes not look realistic. Newsflash: it's intentional. Jeremy Piven, who plays Cusack's real estate friend still trying to get noticed by one of the old cheerleaders, does an awesome job. Watch for his dance scene with the cheerleader. Chemistry between Cusack and Driver is quite good in a PG sort of way. Alan Arkin arguably doesn't get enough screen time and Jenna Elfman and Ann Cusack have very small roles in this film.  The budget for this was $15M but it made over $28M at the box office. 80s and 90s soundtrack music galore.

Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[1, 1]","Ah...what's not to like here...you have Cusack...you have Driver...you have Cusack for a second time in the form of Joan:  John's sister...you have Aykroyd...it's all there in cinematic bliss.  Let me begin shall I?Gross Pointe, I guess its somewhere in Michigan, suburbs of Detroit the Motor City, home of Rock and Roll, or at least the Detroit-ites may say so.  Minnie Driver is a cool local yokel radio announcer with her own stream-of-consciousness style.  Martin Blank, played by Cusack, is a professional killer.  Now wait right there, he's a professional killer with scruples mind you; he turns down a hit on a Greenpeace boat, so he can't be all bad.  Regardless of the profession, he has come to a place in life (it just so happens to coincide with his ten-year high school reunion) where he realizes he is a man without a rudder, without a moral compass, without a woman to love (at least one that he sees daily), and quickly losing his job satisfaction...the joy of the kill, so to speak.There's everything to love in this movie.  There's dry witty humor.  There's originality in spades.  It just reflects the sad state of affairs in Hollywood that this movie tries to be everything...comedy, love, drama, violence.  Did I say violence?  Well with a professional hit man as the lead what did you expect?  Don't worry you Amazonites out there that are movie purists, the shooting and action is all tongue and cheek, all ""they wouldn't let me make this film unless I threw in some gratuitous action"" purity.  If this sounds like an incoherent rant, it is.  But then so is Cusack's dialogue spewing forth philosophy, spewing forth regrets and hope, spewing forth unique words and an even more unique take on life.I broke in to the digital age recently by getting a DVD.  Grosse Pointe Blank, along with High Fidelity, and Pearl Jam's Single Video Theory were on the short list for first buys.  Grosse Pointe stands out (second to Pearl Jam of course...hey it's Pearl Jam) as a favorite.  It's not a work of art, though very stylishly done...it's something more: a movie to love and quote.  A movie to curl up to and claim at the office...that's my favorite.It's got 80's underground playing along in the background with Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Clash, Bowie, the Violent Femmes.  If you were born in the late 60's, graduated in the mid to late 80's, the movie will take you back with some nostalgia, all the while being modern, all the while making you laugh and fall in love with Driver just as Cusack does.

It's got no CG, little special effects, and it's shot mostly in the one location. But what it does have is a story, which is not too far  fetched and maybe one, which we can relate to. In our busy lives do we ever  get time to stop and look back on our past, how are lives have turned out,  and if were happy. It's this message that underlies this black comedy about  a hit man on his final job, returning home, facing his decade old past and  the people he left behind. It makes you stop and think, what have become of  the people you used to know and ultimately left behind, and what have they  done with their lives. The story is excellent both in content, and  execution by John Cusack, (who also co-wrote the script, and starred along  with a good proportion of his family) and Minnie Driver. A story of love in  modern times with deeper meaning summarises this film. This film is a  classic in the making, it's one which you can add to your collection  knowing you've made a good purchase, and one you can watch over and over  again.

No. I love John Cusack and Minnie Driver is a good actress. However, I have never seen a film about a hit an who goes to his high school reunion. I applaud the writer for the premise, but somehow, this film never pulls it off. I suppose it was meant to be a comedy of sorts, if killing people is funny for you.

At first, it just seems like a veiled romantic comedy.  Once you start to see the movie unfold, you can see a lot of effort went into making it.  It's especially exciting to see Cusack show off his martial arts training in one of the fight sequences.

180611,A1J2931UBBJPXM,1558908382,Reviewer,"[5, 7]","A one time Government agent turned independent contract killer, in need of some time off and a career change, goes home for his ten-year High School reunion in ""Grosse Pointe Blank,"" a black comedy from director George  Armitage.  Martin Blank (John Cusack) is on edge; two dissatisfied  customers and a competitor want him off the board, and his life is somehow  unsatisfying.  He's become ""dispassionate, bored and uneasy.""  When he  receives an invitation to his reunion, he is encouraged to go, first by his  secretary, Marcella (Joan Cusack), and then by his analyst, Dr. Oatman  (Alan Arkin), who tells him to go and have a good time:  ""Don't kill  anybody for awhile, see how it feels.""  When one of his unhappy customers  demands that he take a contract to make amends for what they consider a  botched job, and it coincidentally turns out to be in his home town, that  cinches it; he's off to Grosse Pointe, Michigan, to take care of business  and reevaluate his life.  When he hits town, he runs into an old flame,  Debi (Minnie Driver), the girl he stood up on prom night, after which he  subsequently vanished into thin air for the next ten years.  It was the  very night he ran off to join the army, which lead him to his current  ""vocation"" when his psych profile indicated that he had a certain ""moral  flexibility.""  Quickly, the old flame reignites between Martin and Debi,  but there's a complication; Debi's father, Bert (Mitchell Ryan) is Martin's  intended victim, the fact of which Martin is thus far ignorant, because he  hasn't yet opened the dossier he's been given, which contains the details  of the job.  John Cusack gives a magnetic performance as the somewhat  apprehensive Martin, whose cool stoicism is beginning to erode in the face  of some personal misgivings concerning his chosen occupation.  He plays him  for what he is, just a working guy, no different than the postman or a  grocery clerk; and it's that realistic approach that makes this character  believable.  Minnie Driver is delightful here, thoroughly engaging as Debi,  giving her just the spark that's needed to make the connection between her  and Martin real.  Alan Arkin, too, brings his own style of dry humor to the  part of the anxious Dr. Oatman, who refuses to treat Martin (he's  admittedly afraid of him, as well as intimidated), but who has to, because  Martin keeps showing up at his office at the same time every week.  And  Joan Cusack adds that something extra with an energetic, funny performance  that raises the level of the movie just that much more.  Rounding out the  supporting cast are Dan Aykroyd, who does a good turn as Grocer, the rival  killer whose efforts at forming a ""union"" for the independents of their  profession are all for naught; Hank Azaria (Steven), K. Todd Freeman  (McCullers), Jeremy Piven (Paul), Ann Cusack (Amy) and Jenna Elfman  (Tanya).  With a driving soundtrack integrated into the action, clever  dialogue, some good action sequences, and especially the performances of  Cusack and Driver, ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" is a funny, entertaining film; and  with some imaginative touches by Armitage, who does a great job of keeping  the story on track and moving along, this is one you're going to be glad  you didn't let pass you by.",4,Cusack and Driver In Top Form,960768000,"06 12, 2000",2000,3276,"['one', 'time', 'Government', 'agent', 'turned', 'independent', 'contract', 'killer', 'need', 'time', 'off', 'career', 'change', 'home', 'ten-year', 'High', 'School', 'reunion', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'black', 'comedy', 'director', 'George', 'Armitage', 'Martin', 'Blank', 'John', 'Cusack', 'edge', 'two', 'dissatisfied', 'customers', 'competitor', 'want', 'off', 'board', 'life', 'somehow', 'unsatisfying', 'become', 'dispassionate', 'bored', 'uneasy', 'When', 'invitation', 'reunion', 'encouraged', 'go', 'first', 'secretary', 'Marcella', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'then', 'analyst', 'Dr.', 'Oatman', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'who', 'go', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'anybody', 'awhile', 'see', 'how', 'When', 'one', 'unhappy', 'customers', 'take', 'contract', 'make', 'amends', 'what', 'consider', 'botched', 'job', 'coincidentally', 'out', 'be', 'home', 'town', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Michigan', 'take', 'care', 'business', 'reevaluate', 'life', 'When', 'town', 'old', 'flame', 'Debi', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'girl', 'stood', 'up', 'prom', 'night', 'subsequently', 'vanished', 'thin', 'air', 'next', 'ten', 'years', 'was', 'very', 'night', 'ran', 'off', 'join', 'army', 'lead', 'current', 'vocation', 'when', 'psych', 'profile', 'indicated', 'had', 'certain', 'moral', 'flexibility', 'Quickly', 'old', 'flame', 'Martin', 'Debi', 'complication', 'Debi', 'father', 'Bert', 'Mitchell', 'Ryan', 'Martin', 'intended', 'victim', 'fact', 'Martin', 'thus', 'far', 'ignorant', ""n't"", 'yet', 'opened', 'dossier', 'been', 'given', 'details', 'job', 'John', 'Cusack', 'magnetic', 'performance', 'somewhat', 'apprehensive', 'Martin', 'cool', 'stoicism', 'beginning', 'erode', 'face', 'personal', 'misgivings', 'concerning', 'chosen', 'occupation', 'what', 'just', 'working', 'guy', 'different', 'postman', 'grocery', 'clerk', 'realistic', 'approach', 'character', 'believable', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'delightful', 'here', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'Debi', 'giving', 'just', 'spark', 'needed', 'make', 'connection', 'Martin', 'real', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'too', 'own', 'style', 'dry', 'humor', 'part', 'anxious', 'Dr.', 'Oatman', 'who', 'treat', 'Martin', 'admittedly', 'afraid', 'as', 'well', 'intimidated', 'who', 'Martin', 'showing', 'up', 'office', 'same', 'time', 'week', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'something', 'extra', 'energetic', 'funny', 'performance', 'level', 'movie', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'Rounding', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'who', 'good', 'turn', 'Grocer', 'rival', 'killer', 'efforts', 'forming', 'union', 'independents', 'profession', 'are', 'naught', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'Steven', 'K.', 'Todd', 'Freeman', 'McCullers', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Paul', 'Ann', 'Cusack', 'Amy', 'Jenna', 'Elfman', 'Tanya', 'driving', 'soundtrack', 'integrated', 'action', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'especially', 'performances', 'Cusack', 'Driver', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'film', 'imaginative', 'touches', 'Armitage', 'who', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'story', 'track', 'moving', 'along', 'one', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'pass']",Grosse Pointe Blank

Okay, it was amusing in places, and the chemistry was believable, but really, I can't say I see the obsessive qualities.The plot centers around Max Blank (John Cusack), a contract killer who's very good at his job. Through a series of odd coincidences, he ends up having to do a job in Detroit on the week of his tenth high school reunion in Grosse Pointe. Of course, going to the reunion involves seeing the old flame (Minnie Driver) he never picked up for the senior prom. You can probably guess the rest of that subplot.Much of the charm of this movie, aside from the Cusack-Driver chemistry, comes from watching a pretty well put together ensemble cast drliver snappy one-liners. Mitch &#34;after forty years of character acting I'm now serious and must be referred to as Mitchell&#34; Ryan is perfect as Driver's father, Dan Aykroyd shines as a rival contract killer, three (count 'em!) Cusack siblings have minor roles, Jenna Elfman is... well, blonde, etc., etc.The plot moves along, there are a number of chuckles, but... there's nothing that really make this movie stand out. It's kind of like the eight pounds of lettuce loaded on every Subway sub&#8212;there's a good deal of bulk there, and it looks like you're getting a really huge sandwich, but when you're done with it, you realize there was actually a lot less meat than you originally thought. That's not to say that's a bad thing, because the sandwich was still filling.

Once in Grosse Pointe, Blank is up for one surprise after another including a change of heart, and lifestyle, for the girl that he loves, and his final mark who happens to be her father.Grosse Pointe Blank is one of my all time favorite comedies.

Even Alan Arkin is wasted as Cusack's psychatrist (a *hitman* is seeing a *psychatrist*! Get it? Get it?).

Minnie Driver's character seems like just a way for Cusack to get his favorite music into the film. I found their ""relationship"" to be forced at best, and never believed these two belonged together or that real people, hitmen or not, would behave this way.The violence in the film doesn't jibe with its sarcastic, supposedly comedic tone, adding to the viewer's disorientation. The climactic showdown is noise for the sake of noise, suddenly trying to switch gears into a crime caper and failing miserably.This is a plodding mistake of a film, one I found painful to watch (particularly any scene in which Driver and Cusack engage in ""witty"" banter) and even more painful when I think about how the great soundtrack, made up of British punk, new wave, and ska (the Clash, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Specials) is utterly wasted.

What you won't know until you see it is how brilliantly written (and acted) it is.There's a lot of good scenes, but the standout (for me) is Cusak's session with this psychiatrist. Their ping-pong interaction is so wittily constructed that it makes a screenwriter-wannabe (myself) despair.I'd love to give GPB five stars, but Cusak's relationship with Driver is not particularly engaging. Other than her hippieish, Leftward-leaning perspective, we really don't know who she is, or why she ever found him attractive in the first place. For this viewer, their bantering (however clever) seems mostly pointless and often interminable. Nick and Nora they ain't. I'm also bothered by the fact that Cusak's target turns out to be someone who can (conveniently) resolve Cusak's problems if he /isn't/ killed. But GPB is a farce, so I suppose I shouldn't complain too much.The rest of the film, though, is a hoot.

180637,A3S98L5B1SR9P1,1558908382,Zack H.,"[2, 4]","Grosse Point Blank, starring John Cusack and Minnie Driver, was quite enjoyable. It focused on a professional hit man (Martin Blank, played by John Cusack) with the gruesome task of completing his next mission in his hometown of Grosse Point, Michigan, to which he relunctantly accepts. He returns to Grosse Point on the weekend of his High School reunion. When he returns to Grosse Point, he finds his former girlfriend Debbie, who he abandoned on prom night. While in Grosse Point, he is also on the run from an angry associate's henchmen. This was a very funny dark comedy with a few slightly violent scences and a moderate amount of profanities. I would recommend this movie to many.",5,Grosse Pointe Blank,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,687,"['Grosse', 'Point', 'Blank', 'starring', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'focused', 'professional', 'hit', 'man', 'Martin', 'Blank', 'played', 'John', 'Cusack', 'gruesome', 'task', 'completing', 'next', 'mission', 'hometown', 'Grosse', 'Point', 'Michigan', 'relunctantly', 'Grosse', 'Point', 'weekend', 'High', 'School', 'reunion', 'When', 'Grosse', 'Point', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Debbie', 'who', 'abandoned', 'prom', 'night', 'Grosse', 'Point', 'also', 'run', 'angry', 'associate', 'henchmen', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'dark', 'comedy', 'few', 'slightly', 'violent', 'scences', 'moderate', 'amount', 'profanities', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'many']",Grosse Pointe Blank
