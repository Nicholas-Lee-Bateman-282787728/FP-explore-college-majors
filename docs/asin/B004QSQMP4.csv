1426108,A2VP791XUP9UWN,B004QSQMP4,GJW; Florida,"[12, 15]","This movie was made in England, so you have to listen intently to understand what they are talking about. Then you realise there isn't much of interest in what they are saying. It is all just filler to take up time and space inbetween the  so called good stuff. The camera action is terrible and may give you a headache. Sound isnt much better and fades in and out. The two bad guys are dumb and dumber, the two cops after them are not much better. I believe alot of scenes have been cut out of this movie, as some of it is incoherant, parts lack reasons or explanation, and it seems quite choppy at times. The two cops just vanish from the movie half way through and we are left to wonder where they are. There isn""t much explanation of why there are a couple of zombies, but the zombies are only on screen for maybe one minute, so it doesn't really matter. Although you do watch wanting to know what caused the zombies in the first place. Sorry, that info is on the cutting room floor. Also, the zombies don't really look like zombies, they only have a bit of blood smeared on them, no gross features. So, here we go; Two guys are on the run after torturing and killing a young woman while filming it on VHS tape, which the police manage to find. You get to see very little of this in this movie. The two bad guys go to a bar where they kidnap another young slightly over weight young woman. She gets raped by one of the guys, gets away, running naked through the woods. They shoot her, end of movie. But wait, the real ending was shown at the beginning of the movie, where our two idiots are trying to bury the young dead raped girl, but mostly sit around talking nonsense until the zombies show up and eat them. It is not much of a spoiler since it happens in the first few minutes of the movie. There is some real nudity in this film. Full frontal female in a shower scene, and full frontal nudity in the rape scene, no male nudity. Very little gore. No suspense. I've seen worse movies, but that does't make this one very good, and it isn't. Good nudity, poor acting, camera work, sound, editing, and incomplete plot!",2,Cover art is best part of Tortured!,1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,2123,"['movie', 'was', 'made', 'England', 'have', 'listen', 'intently', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'Then', 'realise', ""n't"", 'much', 'interest', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'just', 'filler', 'take', 'up', 'time', 'space', 'inbetween', 'so', 'called', 'good', 'stuff', 'camera', 'action', 'terrible', 'may', 'give', 'headache', 'Sound', 'isnt', 'much', 'better', 'fades', 'two', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'dumb', 'dumber', 'two', 'cops', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'believe', 'alot', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'movie', 'incoherant', 'parts', 'lack', 'reasons', 'explanation', 'quite', 'choppy', 'times', 'two', 'cops', 'just', 'vanish', 'movie', 'half', 'way', 'are', 'left', 'wonder', 'where', 'are', 'isn', 't', 'much', 'explanation', 'why', 'are', 'couple', 'zombies', 'zombies', 'are', 'only', 'screen', 'maybe', 'one', 'minute', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'do', 'watch', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'caused', 'zombies', 'first', 'place', 'Sorry', 'info', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Also', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'zombies', 'only', 'have', 'bit', 'blood', 'smeared', 'gross', 'features', 'So', 'here', 'go', 'Two', 'guys', 'are', 'run', 'torturing', 'killing', 'young', 'woman', 'filming', 'VHS', 'tape', 'police', 'manage', 'find', 'get', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'movie', 'two', 'bad', 'guys', 'go', 'bar', 'where', 'kidnap', 'young', 'slightly', 'weight', 'young', 'woman', 'raped', 'one', 'guys', 'away', 'running', 'naked', 'woods', 'shoot', 'end', 'movie', 'wait', 'real', 'ending', 'was', 'shown', 'beginning', 'movie', 'where', 'two', 'idiots', 'are', 'trying', 'bury', 'young', 'dead', 'raped', 'girl', 'mostly', 'sit', 'around', 'talking', 'nonsense', 'zombies', 'show', 'up', 'eat', 'not', 'much', 'spoiler', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'real', 'nudity', 'film', 'Full', 'frontal', 'female', 'shower', 'scene', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'rape', 'scene', 'male', 'nudity', 'Very', 'little', 'gore', 'suspense', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'movies', ""does't"", 'make', 'one', 'very', 'good', ""n't"", 'Good', 'nudity', 'poor', 'acting', 'camera', 'work', 'sound', 'editing', 'incomplete', 'plot']",N/A
1426109,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B004QSQMP4,Grindhouse and Horror,"[5, 6]","This film begins with two men being killed by a couple of zombies, but then the film cuts to the past and we're shown what led up to that attack; but it never explains clearly why they became zombies. This scene has some good gore and you get to see some guts being ripped out.  The simple story involves two escaped convicts who eventually kidnap, rape and kill a woman who they abduct in a bathroom.  Unlike most woman who appear in these type of exploitation flicks, actress Michelle Young isn't as slender; she's a little on the heavy side, but she doesn't look that bad.  If you want gore, you might be disappointed because the beginning flesh eating scene may make one think that the rest of the film is going to be really gory.  However, even though the rest of the film does have some blood in it, the gore overall is low; although the film comes through and delivers in terms of explicit nudity.  There is a shower scene with a masturbation shot and a extremely graphic rape scene; both these scenes contain borderline hardcore nude shots. The rape scene is nasty and long, and there's a disturbing scene involving the woman being fondled with a gun; this scene with the gun has a borderline hardcore shot that some may find disturbing. There's also a lesbian scene in a bathroom, but it's kind of soft. This film is extremely explicit, but it has a problem with being too talky at times. In between the nudity and violence, the film sometimes has a lot of completely unnecessary talk.  This talk is nothing but filler and does nothing but bore the viewer. The film needs to pick up the pace at times; it would've been so much better if they added more action. The film doesn't have any good atmosphere or suspense, and there isn't really any interesting scenery; the lack of all these things may cause some to be bored in between the exploitation. As for the directing, it may or may not be appealing depending on how many of these low-budget shot-on-video movies you like to watch. Another problem that the film has is with its frame rate.  It might be missing frames or they used a cheap mini DV camcorder to film it; this is noticeable and gets annoying. The movie did get better for me with another viewing, but most horror fans might be disappointed with this flick.The DVD is in widescreen, but it isn't anamorphic which is disappointing. The picture is reasonably sharp and the brightness is decent. The colors look decent but look a little washed out in places, and the contrast isn't that good and needs improvement. I also noticed that there are some parts that have better color and contrast than the large majority of the film. There are some parts where the color and contrast look OK, but there are problems with both of these things throughout the majority of the film. A better transfer would've helped the film. It has a good behind the scenes extra feature that's worth seeing; it was better than some other behind the scenes extras that I've seen on other DVDs. There's also a making of segment and an audio commentary; the commentary is pretty good.",3,"If you want shot on digital video trash.

1426111,A10E6UXWQFKD5M,B004QSQMP4,Topper In Missouri,"[8, 9]","""Tortured"" and ""Psychopaths Sex With Hostages"" are both the exact same movie only with different titles.  The only real difference between the two is that ""Tortured"" has about 5 Minutes of Zombies at the beginning of the movie after the woman who gets raped and killed comes back to life after her dead body comes into contact with toxic waste.  I'm guessing if your looking at this review, then you aren't looking for a movie that's going to win an Academy Award your looking for something that has no socialy redeeming qualities what so ever.  The scenes that lead up to the sex scene are boring make little or no sense and will cause you to fast forward through them (plus the thick British accents make the dialog difficult to understand).  The rape/sex scene (again the same scene in both movies), is graphic and violent. In many of the movies that you will buy on Amazon, the woman's ""sensitive area"" is blured out or something blocks the view of it, not the case with this movie, the woman's legs are spead wide by the rapist and the camera zooms in as she is raped with a gun.",2,the same movie on a different title,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,1084,"['Tortured', 'Psychopaths', 'Sex', 'Hostages', 'are', 'exact', 'same', 'movie', 'only', 'different', 'titles', 'only', 'real', 'difference', 'two', 'Tortured', 'about', '5', 'Minutes', 'Zombies', 'beginning', 'movie', 'woman', 'who', 'raped', 'killed', 'back', 'life', 'dead', 'body', 'contact', 'toxic', 'waste', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'looking', 'review', 'then', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'movie', 'going', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'looking', 'something', 'socialy', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'scenes', 'lead', 'up', 'sex', 'scene', 'are', 'boring', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'will', 'cause', 'fast', 'forward', 'thick', 'British', 'accents', 'make', 'dialog', 'difficult', 'understand', 'rape/sex', 'scene', 'again', 'same', 'scene', 'movies', 'graphic', 'violent', 'many', 'movies', 'will', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'woman', 'sensitive', 'area', 'blured', 'out', 'something', 'blocks', 'view', 'not', 'case', 'movie', 'woman', 'legs', 'are', 'spead', 'wide', 'rapist', 'camera', 'raped', 'gun']",N/A
