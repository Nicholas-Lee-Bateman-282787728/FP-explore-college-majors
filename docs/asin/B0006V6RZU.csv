874729,A2EMP366TTS6E1,B0006V6RZU,Judith Miller,"[25, 26]","Back When We Were Grownups is a delightful film.  I watched it when it was presented as a Hallmark movie and it stayed in my mind for weeks after I viewed it.It's the story of Rebecca Davitch (Blythe Danner) who at the age of 53 finds herself looking at her life and wondering how she became the person that she turned into.As a young woman, still in college, she was engaged to a Will Allenby (Peter Fonda), a serious academic and they had a plan for their future.  While at a reception, she met Joe Davitch, a divorced man, several years her senior. Rebecca was flattered and very much infatuated by the attention from Joe, and she married him without much consideration, except that she seemed to love him.  She immediately became a stepmother to three little girls and manager of a home based business. She also inherited her husband's Uncle Poppy (Jack Palance) who had been living with the Davitch family since his wife died. Within a few years, Rebecca and Joe had their own child, another daughter. To further add to the confusion, Rebecca also has to deal with her husband's former wife who is played by Faye DunawayAlthough, amusing in many ways, I felt this story had a real feeling about the various relationships and jealousies that can crop up in any family. It also shows how one person often takes on the responsibility of keeping a family together.Like many avid readers, I find that movies based on books, are rarely as good as the books.  However, in this case, I enjoyed the film more than the book. I also thought that Blythe Danner did an excellent job in the major role of Rebecca.",5,--Story of the quirky and engaging Davitch family--,1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,1604,"['Back', 'When', 'Were', 'Grownups', 'delightful', 'film', 'watched', 'when', 'was', 'presented', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'stayed', 'mind', 'weeks', 'viewed', 'it.It', 'story', 'Rebecca', 'Davitch', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'who', 'age', '53', 'finds', 'looking', 'life', 'wondering', 'how', 'became', 'person', 'turned', 'into.As', 'young', 'woman', 'still', 'college', 'was', 'engaged', 'Will', 'Allenby', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'serious', 'academic', 'had', 'plan', 'future', 'reception', 'met', 'Joe', 'Davitch', 'divorced', 'man', 'several', 'years', 'senior', 'Rebecca', 'was', 'flattered', 'very', 'much', 'infatuated', 'attention', 'Joe', 'married', 'much', 'consideration', 'seemed', 'love', 'immediately', 'became', 'stepmother', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'manager', 'home', 'based', 'business', 'also', 'inherited', 'husband', 'Uncle', 'Poppy', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'living', 'Davitch', 'family', 'wife', 'died', 'few', 'years', 'Rebecca', 'Joe', 'had', 'own', 'child', 'daughter', 'further', 'add', 'confusion', 'Rebecca', 'also', 'deal', 'husband', 'former', 'wife', 'who', 'played', 'Faye', 'DunawayAlthough', 'amusing', 'many', 'ways', 'felt', 'story', 'had', 'real', 'feeling', 'various', 'relationships', 'jealousies', 'can', 'crop', 'up', 'family', 'also', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'often', 'responsibility', 'keeping', 'family', 'many', 'avid', 'readers', 'find', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'are', 'rarely', 'as', 'good', 'books', 'However', 'case', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'book', 'also', 'thought', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'major', 'role', 'Rebecca']",N/A

He captured her heart with his charisma, and despite the fact that he had three young girls to raise (because his wife left him), she marries him anyway.The big Victorian house is the focal point of the Open Arms entertainment business, which also sweeps Rebecca up into its ""arms"" after the marriage, too.Then, when Joe is killed just a few years later, Rebecca is alone with it all--raising the girls, running the business, and taking care of Joe's elderly uncle whom everyone calls ""Poppy.""At the beginning of the film, we meet the characters several years later at a point in time when Rebecca has begun to question her choices, her role in the lives of this family, and the road not taken.  Which is why she suddenly calls her boyfriend from all those years ago...just to see what might happen.Back When We Were Grownups (Hallmark Hall of Fame)is based on the Anne Tyler novel of the same name, and throughout, I could feel Rebecca's angst:  the losses, the possible wrong choices, and the ""what-ifs"".  An amazing cast populates this film, including Blythe Danner as Rebecca; Peter Riegert as Zeb, Joe's brother; Jack Palance as Poppy; Peter Fonda as the ex-boyfriend; and Faye Dunaway as Joe's ex-wife, who swoops in for the occasional celebratory moment.I had seen this movie several years ago on the Hallmark channel, but when someone recently mentioned the book--which I also have--I really wanted to experience this again.  I am happy that I did.  I award five stars to this colorful, dysfunctional, and wonderful family experience.",5,EXPLORING THE ROAD NOT TAKEN....,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,1662,"['Rebecca', 'Davitch', 'centerpiece', 'family', 'inherited', 'when', 'married', 'Joe', 'Davitch', 'years', 'ago', 'captured', 'heart', 'charisma', 'fact', 'had', 'three', 'young', 'girls', 'raise', 'wife', 'left', 'anyway.The', 'big', 'Victorian', 'house', 'focal', 'point', 'Open', 'Arms', 'entertainment', 'business', 'also', 'Rebecca', 'up', 'arms', 'marriage', 'too.Then', 'when', 'Joe', 'killed', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Rebecca', 'alone', 'raising', 'girls', 'running', 'business', 'taking', 'care', 'Joe', 'elderly', 'uncle', 'whom', 'everyone', 'Poppy', 'beginning', 'film', 'meet', 'characters', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'point', 'time', 'when', 'Rebecca', 'begun', 'question', 'choices', 'role', 'lives', 'family', 'road', 'not', 'taken', 'Which', 'why', 'suddenly', 'boyfriend', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'might', 'happen.Back', 'When', 'Were', 'Grownups', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'based', 'Anne', 'Tyler', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'could', 'feel', 'Rebecca', 'angst', 'losses', 'possible', 'wrong', 'choices', 'what-ifs', 'amazing', 'cast', 'film', 'including', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'Rebecca', 'Peter', 'Riegert', 'Zeb', 'Joe', 'brother', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'Poppy', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Joe', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'occasional', 'celebratory', 'moment.I', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'when', 'someone', 'recently', 'mentioned', 'book', 'also', 'have', 'really', 'wanted', 'experience', 'again', 'am', 'happy', 'did', 'award', 'five', 'stars', 'colorful', 'dysfunctional', 'wonderful', 'family', 'experience']",N/A
