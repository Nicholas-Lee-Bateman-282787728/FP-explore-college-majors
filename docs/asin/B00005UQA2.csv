The subtle charm of this movie comes through in the realism of the characters- none of them are downright evil or intirely self-absorbed but they simply make mistakes because they were unaware of what they are doing and the consequences of it.  The characters range from a fourty year old actress that's tired of just getting by, to a successful business man who preferes to daydream and allow others to run his life, to a couple that share a life together but are detatched from the sentiments of true love that have failed them in the past.I would classify this movie more as a comedy/ drama- because of the story's need to express the characters highs and lows lending to the realism that was mentioned before.  The acting was superb and heart felt and the dialoge was fluid.

Here's why:1.  It's about 90% character-driven.  There is something of a plot, but it exists mainly to give the characters something to do while unfolding to us who they really are...and refreshingly, there is zero judgement on the part of the film of any of the main characters.  They simply are what they are.2.  There are no simplistic ""good"" vs. ""bad"" guys.  Instead this film is populated with (gasp!) very believable and human characters who are just familiar enough to elicit the smiling ""aha, they remind me of so-and-so!"" mental balloon from the viewer, yet free of glib stereotyping so as not to bore us or insult our intelligence.  (Read: the French film industry doesn't rely on focus groups to dumb down its movies for the lowest common denominator like Hollywood does.)3.  Sex is treated just as...well, sex.  No stupid puritannical or moralistic hangups, no hypocritical voyeurism, no infantile romantic fairy tales.  It's just something men and women do, whether for love or simple random pleasure, and whether it's two men or a men and a woman is completely irrelevant.  OH MY GOD...this film is just sooooooooooo RADICAL!!!Aside from those three simply earth-shakingly audacious qualities, this film just has a wonderfully mature, elegantly restrained manner which is almost unheard of these days.  Yes the pacing is leisurely (like most French movies) are but never drags (unlike many), because the characters prove to be so deeply human and real not formulaic, so we can't help caring about what happens to them next.I was especially stunned to find out that the actress who plays Manie, a sexy but subtlely (and irresistibly) spunky, solidly independent young woman who tends bar and deals hashish, is also the film's (first-time) DIRECTOR.

685802,A2BPDFR58H9575,B00005UQA2,Galina,"[2, 2]","When I wrote about Agnes Jaoui's ""Comme une image"" (2004)aka ""Look at me"", I called it a triple triumph for its writer/director/star. I should have reserved the definition for her debut, The Taste of Others (2000) which was nominated for the Oscar as The Best Foreign Film and for nine Cesars. The film received four Cesars, including two for Jaoui, for Best film and Best Writing that she shared with her off-screen husband and co-star/co-writer, Jean-Pierre Bacri. The film deserves them all. It belongs to one of my favorite genres of different kind of comedy, subtle, depending not on laughing out loud situations and the funny clich&eacute;s but on the genuineness of the characters and their interactions. It is a character driven film, and every character is alive, real, often weak and even boring but as their stories interweave, we began to see how much the movie has to say about many important things and how well it did so. What really attracts me to Agnes Jaoui's film is non-judgment of the main characters but the interest to and understanding them. This is the French film in the best meaning of the word - not glamorous, without expensive set decorations or breathtakingly beautiful lead heroes whose passion would burn the screen, no, it is quiet, ironic, elegantly constructed, it moves on its own relaxed pace, but it never drags, and its every word, smile, look, and sound combine in a wonderful watching experience. I also see it as a young writer/director/star's comment on the importance of art in our lives, and how it can really change a person and their outlook. One more thing, I simply admire Jaoui's taste in music. The scores for this film and for ""Look at Me"" include the examples of some of the most beautiful classic music ever written.4.5/5 or 9/10",4,The movie for my taste,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,1784,"['When', 'wrote', 'Agnes', 'Jaoui', 'Comme', 'une', 'image', '2004', 'Look', 'called', 'triple', 'triumph', 'writer/director/star', 'should', 'have', 'reserved', 'definition', 'debut', 'Taste', 'Others', '2000', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'nine', 'Cesars', 'film', 'received', 'four', 'Cesars', 'including', 'two', 'Jaoui', 'Best', 'film', 'Best', 'Writing', 'shared', 'off-screen', 'husband', 'co-star/co-writer', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Bacri', 'film', 'one', 'favorite', 'genres', 'different', 'kind', 'comedy', 'subtle', 'depending', 'not', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'situations', 'funny', 'clich', 'eacute', 'genuineness', 'characters', 'interactions', 'character', 'driven', 'film', 'character', 'alive', 'real', 'often', 'weak', 'even', 'boring', 'stories', 'interweave', 'began', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'say', 'many', 'important', 'things', 'how', 'well', 'did', 'so', 'What', 'really', 'Agnes', 'Jaoui', 'film', 'non-judgment', 'main', 'characters', 'interest', 'understanding', 'French', 'film', 'best', 'meaning', 'word', 'not', 'glamorous', 'expensive', 'set', 'decorations', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'lead', 'heroes', 'passion', 'would', 'burn', 'screen', 'quiet', 'ironic', 'elegantly', 'constructed', 'own', 'relaxed', 'pace', 'never', 'word', 'smile', 'look', 'sound', 'combine', 'wonderful', 'watching', 'experience', 'also', 'see', 'young', 'writer/director/star', 'comment', 'importance', 'art', 'lives', 'how', 'can', 'really', 'change', 'person', 'outlook', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'simply', 'admire', 'Jaoui', 'taste', 'music', 'scores', 'film', 'Look', 'Me', 'include', 'examples', 'most', 'beautiful', 'classic', 'music', 'ever', 'written.4.5/5', '9/10']",The Taste Of Others

From the very beginning of the movie we feel as if we just dropped in on some French people who are having varying discussions that seem extemporaneous, loose and unrelated:  nouveau riche businessman Castella (Jean-Pierre Bacri) discusses mundane notions with his clueless 'decorator' wife Beatrice (Brigitte Catillon); Castella's worldly bodyguard Bruno (Alain Chabat) passes the time with his rather boring buddy Franck (Gerard Lanvin); middle aged actress and English teacher Clara (Anne Alvaro) pines away at how her life in the arts is aimless; bartender Manie (director Agnes Jaoui) ponders why men are so fickle as lovers...you get the picture.  But the beauty of this film is how the story interweaves these various isolated 21st Century people's lives and in doing so makes many valid comments on the importance of the arts in our lives, the power of 'opposites attract', the need for meaningful relationships to keep us on course, and the varied ways we all view our surroundings, our lives, depending on our individual vantages.  Here is a film with wonderful acting, smart ideas well played out, and a musical score that is so varied and good that it is well worth a CD!

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[1, 1]","""The taste of others"" is basically a story about conceptions and preconceptions, and the role they play in everyday life. The taste of the characters, when confronted with the taste of others, sometimes seems merely a pretext to judge and exclude them...The plot is relatively simple: a prosperous industrialist, Castella (Jean-Pierre Bacri), needs to learn English, something that he really doesn't want to do. A subordinate arranges him a meeting with Clara (Anne Alvaro), an English professor that doesn't strike Castella as overly good due to the fact that she doesn't have a specific method to teach English. However, things change when he is dragged to the theatre by his wife and witnesses Clara playing the main role in ""Berenice"", a drama by Racine. By a strange twist of fate, Castella falls in love with Clara, and decide to take up English classes as a way to be near her. But will that be enough, when Castella is married, and Clara is so different from him?Besides Castella, his eccentric wife Angelique (Christiane Millet) and Clara, this film includes other stories that relate to the main one but have their own dynamic. Castella's chauffeur, Bruno Deschamps (Alain Chabat), has a girlfriend that is living in another country, and about whom he talks a lot with Franck Moreno (Gerard Lanvin), Castella's bodyguard. The two men are vastly different, but both end up having an affair of sorts with Manie, (played by Agnes Jaoui, who is also the director), a bartender that happens to sell hashish.All these characters relate to each other, and share their ideas and problems with the spectator, that cannot help but reflect on the same issues discussed in the film, even without noticing he is doing exactly that. I don't know for sure, but I think that might have been the purpose of the director, and that the stories are only the tapestry on which Jaoui weaves the ideas she wants to express.All in all, I think that this movie is many things, but never boring. In my opinion, ""The taste of others"" is a very good French film that could have been excellent, if only the ending had managed to wrap up the concepts discussed throughout the movie a little better.

It was in it's own way but it was visually a lot less so than many ""romance"" European films that I'd seen.  The movie started out rather uneventful.  There was a rather tightly-wound business executive who seemed to be the primary character in the movie.  The people he interacted with had people they interacted with but eventually we come up with two main plots and a number of lesser plots.  I could see that the director was trying to explore relationships between men and women who seem to be complete opposites.  One couple was quite believable while the other seemed to be more of a one-sided  embarassment.When ""The Taste of Others"" ended, I found myself completely caught up in the movie's outcome.  I had a very warm, positive feeling and I was genuinely impressed.  The strength of ""The Taste of Others"" lies in the Director's subtle suggestions countered by  blatant images.  The smile at the end says it all.  No wonder it was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar.

685808,A3N9TGJFS6IQFY,B00005UQA2,SheLikesDvds.com,"[3, 5]","In this Academy Award-nominated French film, a host of unlucky-in-love characters spin a sophisticated, comedic tale of casual sex and adulterous impulses. All the characters are somehow connected to each other, by friends or co-workers, new loves or new acquaintances. The two relationships that receive the most attention are between Jean-Jacque, a married man, and Clara, the actress/English teacher he falls for, and Manie, a sassy bartender/waitress who deals drugs on the side, and Jean-Jacque's conservative but straight-talking bodyguard. These two relationships pose the most interesting questions of the film: 1) Can both women and men have casual sex without becoming unduly emotionally attached? and 2) What happens when a man lets a woman transform him?However, Jean-Jacque's struggle and transformation is the heart of this film. He starts off as an almost cartoonish, close-minded, angry man married to a high-strung, meddling interior decorator named Angelique. When he sees Clara perform at the theater and begins taking English classes from her, he enters a new world of trendy venues and artistic sensibilities. He is clearly smitten with her, but he is also completely uninitiated to the world of art, becoming a joke and easy mark to Clara's friends.
