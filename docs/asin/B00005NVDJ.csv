Captain Kirk beams down to an isolated planet on a diplomatic visit  -  but never arrives there.  Instead, he finds himself still on board the Enterprise, but all alone.  Yet the Enterprise can't find him aboard, despite the insistence of the planet's inhabitants that Kirk never materialized among them.  Eventually, Kirk encounters a beautiful alien girl (is there any other kind, where he's concerned?) named Odona, who falls in love with him (come on, you knew that, right?).  It's all part of a nefarious plot by the planet's inhabitants to thin out their overpopulation  -  but as to how, you can find that out yourself.  The early scenes, with Kirk haunting an empty Enterprise like his own ghost, are rather eerie, and Sharon Acker is delightfully appealing as the childlike Odona.""Whom Gods Destroy"" is just plain fun, no matter how you slice it.  The inmates have taken over the asylum on an isolated prison planet, but Kirk doesn't find out until he's beamed into the situation and found himself held prisoner.  The man who freed his fellow inmates is a fellow Starfleet captain gone mad named Garth (Steve Ihnat), who learned the unique talent of being able to rearrange his molecular structure to appear like anyone he chooses, and intends to impersonate Kirk and commandeer the Enterprise.  Spock smells something wrong, but can't get into the facility to arrange a rescue attempt.  While he works that little problem out, Kirk has an assortment of adventures with the mad Captain Garth and his erstwhile concubine, the equally mad green alien dancer girl, Marta (Yvonne Craig).Ihnat was a lesser-known character actor of the time, whose premature death unfortunately deprived us all of seeing more of him  -  he's quite good here, as he was in everything he did  -  and anything with Yvonne ""Batgirl"" Craig is always a delight.",4,Appearances Are Deceiving...,1030233600,"08 25, 2002",2002,1994,"['Captain', 'Kirk', 'discovers', 'two', 'pretty', 'good', 'episodes', 'Mark', 'Gideon', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'plausible', 'fun', 'actually', 'kind', 'creepy', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'beams', 'down', 'isolated', 'planet', 'diplomatic', 'visit', 'never', 'there', 'Instead', 'still', 'board', 'Enterprise', 'alone', 'Enterprise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'aboard', 'insistence', 'planet', 'inhabitants', 'Kirk', 'never', 'materialized', 'Eventually', 'Kirk', 'beautiful', 'alien', 'girl', 'there', 'other', 'kind', 'where', 'concerned', 'named', 'Odona', 'who', 'love', 'come', 'knew', 'right', 'part', 'nefarious', 'plot', 'planet', 'inhabitants', 'thin', 'out', 'overpopulation', 'how', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'early', 'scenes', 'Kirk', 'haunting', 'empty', 'Enterprise', 'own', 'ghost', 'are', 'rather', 'eerie', 'Sharon', 'Acker', 'delightfully', 'appealing', 'childlike', 'Odona', 'Whom', 'Gods', 'Destroy', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'matter', 'how', 'slice', 'inmates', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'asylum', 'isolated', 'prison', 'planet', 'Kirk', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'beamed', 'situation', 'found', 'held', 'prisoner', 'man', 'who', 'freed', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'fellow', 'Starfleet', 'captain', 'gone', 'mad', 'named', 'Garth', 'Steve', 'Ihnat', 'who', 'learned', 'unique', 'talent', 'being', 'able', 'rearrange', 'molecular', 'structure', 'appear', 'anyone', 'impersonate', 'Kirk', 'commandeer', 'Enterprise', 'Spock', 'something', 'wrong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'facility', 'arrange', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'little', 'problem', 'Kirk', 'assortment', 'adventures', 'mad', 'Captain', 'Garth', 'erstwhile', 'concubine', 'equally', 'mad', 'green', 'alien', 'dancer', 'girl', 'Marta', 'Yvonne', 'Craig', '.Ihnat', 'was', 'lesser-known', 'character', 'actor', 'time', 'premature', 'death', 'unfortunately', 'deprived', 'seeing', 'more', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'was', 'everything', 'did', 'anything', 'Yvonne', 'Batgirl', 'Craig', 'always', 'delight']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Vol. 36, Episodes 71 & 72: Whom Gods Destroy/ The Mark of Gideon"

The Elba II facility treats the few remaining incorrigible, criminally insane of the galaxy and has taken on a new inmate, Garth of Izar a former starship fleet captain. While on Elba II Kirk and Spock find out that all isn't as it seems, Cory is trapped in Garth's cell and the man that looks like Cory changes into the form of Captain Garth much to Kirk and Spock's surprise. Kirk and Spock are taken captive by the madman Garth and the other inmates who have taken control of the asylum after Garth escaped his cell and led the uprising. Garth has mastered the ability of cellular metamorphosis taught to him by the people of Antos IV to repair the destroyed parts of his body following a horrible accident. Using the ability to change into any form he was able to trick a guard making him think that Cory was trapped in Garth's cell.Garth's plan was a simple one: take control of the Enterprise and use the starship to punish the members of his crew who had mutinied against him; resulting in his being incarcerated on Elba II. Garth had condemned the entire Antos race to destruction after recovering from his injuries. The people of Antos IV had healed Garth and in his gratitude the deranged star captain offered them the galaxy, an offer that the Antosians refused. Unable to deal with the stresses of the horrific ordeal he had survived, Garth went mad and saw the Antos Race as a threat to the Federation and ordered them to be annihilated. His crew refused the unjustified and unlawful order and then took control of the ship.Assuming the form of Captain Kirk, Garth attempted to be beamed aboard the Enterprise, but requiring the correct response to a chess problem that Garth didn't know Scotty refused the imposter access to the Enterprise. Thwarted, an enraged Garth vowed to take the Enterprise at all costs. ""Lord"" Garth and his followers attempt to acquire the chess problem's solution from Captain Kirk by using every means at his disposal. From his companion Marta, the seductive yet deadly green Orion woman to attempting to trick and torturing Kirk even torturing Cory, still Garth fails to extract the information due to Kirk's discipline and training, which are put to the test. Garth who had proclaimed himself ""Master of The Universe"" even executed Marta right in front of Kirk by detonating an explosive on the gaseous and poisonous surface of Elba II, hidden in a necklace the madman had given her. The explosion registered on the Enterprise's sensors, prompting a worried and frustrated Scotty to take action by trying to penetrate the planet's security shield using the ship's powerful phaser banks. The shield which protects the asylum dome from attack or prevents beaming when in operation easily stand up to the starship's onslaught.Attempting one final gambit, Garth allows Spock to escape his cell and make it to the asylum's control room armed with a phaser thus putting Spock in the role of King Solomon. Garth took the form of Kirk and Spock is confronted with having to choose between two Captain Kirks, one who is actually the captain and the other who is Garth in the form of his captain. A fight ensues between the two Kirks, but Spock is able to tell the difference between them and stuns the impostor. With Governor Cory released and the asylum finally back in the proper authority, the Enterprise is able to complete her mission and send down more medicine to replace the supply destroyed by Garth and his followers. With the help of McCoy, Cory is able to administer the medicine to the inmates starting them on the road to recovery.This episode was a gem of the third season.

Garth wants to take control of the enterprise and hunt down his crew that mutinied. Captain Garth cannot escape the prison planet because he does not know the final chess move for a sign allowing Scottie to beam them aboard. Garth transforms in a fake Kirk and contacts Scottie, but unable to give the counter sign.  Garth explodes into a rage and sinks into deep despair.  Garth then confronts Kirk for the counter sign, but Kirk will not assist Garth in escape.Garth does not seem like a mad man when listening to his logic and reasoning, but his actions are cruel and deadly.  Garth and Spock are almost equals in their attitudes of superiority, with the exception that Spock obeys Kirk.  Garth would not listen to Kirk.

Yvonne Craig (Batgirl) appears in green makeup as a mental patient with a Black Widow's complex (perhaps one should call her the Green Widow).The Mark of Gideon is one of Trek's better issue-oriented episodes.  Tackling the hot button topics of overpopulation and contraception took some bravery on the part of the writers, and they more than rose to the task.

670605,A1G9IV3IBW8WMP,B00005NVDJ,Jared Insell,"[3, 3]","Volume 36 of the Star Trek DVD series includes two of the better episodes from the tail end of the TV series' third and final season on NBC.  Both these epiosdes are fairly decent despite the typical third season flaws.WHOM THE GODS DESTROY is simply a fun Star Trek episode.  Kirk and Spock beam down to the prison planet Elba II to find that Garth of Izar (Steve Ihnat), an infamous Star Fleet Captin who wiped out an entire race, has taken control of the prison complex from Governor Cory.  Using his ability to shapshift into different characters Garth attempts to take over the Enterprise.  This episode is actually pretty laughable.  Garth's evil plan is way too far fetched to even work.  But perhaps the producers wanted to point out that the character was utterly insane.  It's the cast of colourful characters and the over the top acting that save this one.  Ihnat is great as the bantering Garth and Yvonne Craig (Batgirl from the TV show Batman) makes a great acting appearance as Marta (the green alien woman).  Ironically the third Batman guest star to appear in a consecutive Star Trek episode.  Too bad Adam West, Burt Ward, Burgess Meredith and Caesar Romero never showed up as guest stars huh?MARK OF GIDEON is a little more serious and almost creepy.  Another Star Trek issue oriented episode.  This time tackling overpopulation problems and contraception.  Most of the screen time is given to Shatner and guest star Sharon Acker who plays Odana.  There is great chemistry between the two and the acting in this episode is quite good.  Good casting and a strong plot overshadow the obvious production budget flaws on this episode (most of it was filmed on the Enterprise set).  The Gideon council leader, Hodin, is played by David Hurst, who made a hilarious appearance as Baron Von Klutz on the Monkees TV series.  Here though he plays a suprisingly serious role as the main antagonist.Overall a good set of third season episodes.  One laughable one a little more dark and serious.  Considering that the tail end of the final season was filled with bad episodes this is quite refreshing to watch becuase these are a few better episodes from the wildly uneven third season.
