508868,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B00000K0E2,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","Eric's obsession with movies takes a deadly turn after he decides that he has suffered his final abuses from his friends and co-workers. With some quick make-up and costuming, Eric transforms himself into Dracula, Hopalong Cassidy, The Mummy, and other silver screen idols as he sets off into the night to seek his revenge! This relatively obscure and largely forgotten Horror film hit during the height of the Slasher cycle, yet it offers something new to the genre entirely. Eric is played by the sheepish Dennis Christopher, who is not just your typical nerd. Despite being constantly picked on by his peers, Eric maintains a high sense of self-esteem, and even has the guts to ask out his favorite lady, who bears an incredible similarity to Marilyn Monroe. It is only due to a series of unfortunate circumstances that Eric finally snaps and lashes out against his aggressors. Like TERROR TRAIN, FADE TO BLACK is mostly bloodless, and instead focuses on Eric's descent into madness rather than the exploitation of nudity and gore. Writer/Director Vernon Zimmerman leaves no room for subtlety in his frequent homages to both the Horror genre and film at large, but the clever allusions to WHITE HEAT and KISS OF DEATH are sure to be appreciated by movie buffs. Christopher is enjoyable in each of his many impressions, and successfully manages to draw from the audience's sympathies. FADE TO BLACK will hold a certain appeal for the fans of early 80's Slashers, and ranks right alongside NIGHT WARNING and CURTAINS as one of the more underappreciated films in the subgenre.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,Fade to Black,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1607,"['Eric', 'obsession', 'movies', 'deadly', 'turn', 'suffered', 'final', 'abuses', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'quick', 'make-up', 'costuming', 'Eric', 'Dracula', 'Hopalong', 'Cassidy', 'Mummy', 'other', 'silver', 'screen', 'idols', 'off', 'night', 'seek', 'revenge', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'Horror', 'film', 'hit', 'height', 'Slasher', 'cycle', 'something', 'new', 'genre', 'entirely', 'Eric', 'played', 'sheepish', 'Dennis', 'Christopher', 'who', 'not', 'just', 'typical', 'nerd', 'being', 'constantly', 'picked', 'peers', 'Eric', 'high', 'sense', 'self-esteem', 'even', 'guts', 'ask', 'out', 'favorite', 'lady', 'who', 'incredible', 'similarity', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'only', 'due', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'circumstances', 'Eric', 'finally', 'out', 'aggressors', 'TERROR', 'TRAIN', 'FADE', 'TO', 'BLACK', 'mostly', 'bloodless', 'instead', 'focuses', 'Eric', 'descent', 'madness', 'rather', 'exploitation', 'nudity', 'gore', 'Writer/Director', 'Vernon', 'Zimmerman', 'room', 'subtlety', 'frequent', 'homages', 'Horror', 'genre', 'film', 'large', 'clever', 'allusions', 'WHITE', 'HEAT', 'KISS', 'OF', 'DEATH', 'are', 'sure', 'be', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'buffs', 'Christopher', 'enjoyable', 'many', 'impressions', 'successfully', 'draw', 'audience', 'sympathies', 'FADE', 'TO', 'BLACK', 'will', 'hold', 'certain', 'appeal', 'fans', 'early', '80', 'Slashers', 'ranks', 'right', 'alongside', 'NIGHT', 'WARNING', 'CURTAINS', 'one', 'more', 'underappreciated', 'films', 'subgenre.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

Combine this with the boss from Hell and a chance encounter with a Marilyn Monroe look-alike, and you have a perfect set-up for a descent into insanity.

508871,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00000K0E2,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 4]","One more film, you may say, on the cinema as a perverted model for young men. It came out in 1981, at a time when the campaign against violence in films and on TV was going on full blast under the accusation that it was the teacher in violence for a vast array of violent teenagers and young men. The film though is slightly more positive than that and critical of this easy and narrow-minded position. It analyzes one concrete case and is very careful to show how the young man has become a film-addict because of the absurd family position in which he was living : raised by a crippled mother (a car accident) who refused to declare herself his mother not to break her dancing career which was broken anyway four years later by the car accident. Frustration, loss of references, destructured or unstrustured emotional landscape, and a vindictive henpecking rather bitchy mother/aunt who is also slightly perverted and requires her son/nephew to massage her back in the evening. It is the meeting of a girl looking like Marylin Monroe, her not coming to a promised rendez-vous and several ensuing mishaps that lead him into realizing a few vengeful crimes on the model of some of his favorite films and actors. It is an already sick mind that falls in the trap of imitating violence in films. In other words this violence is only active on already disturbed young males. Strangely enough, at the time, the case of women was not even considered. Since then of course many other films have been shot on the subject. This film takes advantage too of this opportunity to nail a big stake in the back of some policemen who only think that the solution is and can only be  Shoot them down and eventually bring them in, if it is not too much of an effort to do so, otherwise go back to the first instruction and shoot them down.  This attitude has widely changed  and we have learned a lot that we have to be preventive, without segregating against some who could be sorted out as potential criminals, and afterwards reformative, though the persistance of the death penalty prevents that reformative stand from prevailing.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne",4,Never ever meet dead stars.,1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,2223,"['One', 'more', 'film', 'may', 'say', 'cinema', 'perverted', 'model', 'young', 'men', 'came', 'out', '1981', 'time', 'when', 'campaign', 'violence', 'films', 'TV', 'was', 'going', 'full', 'blast', 'accusation', 'was', 'teacher', 'violence', 'vast', 'array', 'violent', 'teenagers', 'young', 'men', 'film', 'slightly', 'more', 'positive', 'critical', 'easy', 'narrow-minded', 'position', 'one', 'concrete', 'case', 'very', 'careful', 'show', 'how', 'young', 'man', 'become', 'film-addict', 'absurd', 'family', 'position', 'was', 'living', 'raised', 'crippled', 'mother', 'car', 'accident', 'who', 'refused', 'declare', 'mother', 'not', 'break', 'dancing', 'career', 'was', 'broken', 'anyway', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'car', 'accident', 'Frustration', 'loss', 'references', 'destructured', 'unstrustured', 'emotional', 'landscape', 'vindictive', 'henpecking', 'rather', 'bitchy', 'mother/aunt', 'who', 'also', 'slightly', 'perverted', 'son/nephew', 'massage', 'back', 'evening', 'meeting', 'girl', 'looking', 'Marylin', 'Monroe', 'not', 'coming', 'promised', 'rendez-vous', 'several', 'ensuing', 'mishaps', 'lead', 'realizing', 'few', 'vengeful', 'crimes', 'model', 'favorite', 'films', 'actors', 'already', 'sick', 'mind', 'trap', 'imitating', 'violence', 'films', 'other', 'words', 'violence', 'only', 'active', 'already', 'disturbed', 'young', 'males', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'time', 'case', 'women', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'considered', 'then', 'course', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'subject', 'film', 'advantage', 'too', 'opportunity', 'nail', 'big', 'stake', 'back', 'policemen', 'who', 'only', 'think', 'solution', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'Shoot', 'down', 'eventually', 'bring', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'do', 'so', 'otherwise', 'go', 'back', 'first', 'instruction', 'shoot', 'down', 'attitude', 'widely', 'changed', 'have', 'learned', 'lot', 'have', 'be', 'preventive', 'segregating', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'sorted', 'out', 'potential', 'criminals', 'afterwards', 'reformative', 'persistance', 'death', 'penalty', 'reformative', 'stand', 'prevailing.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'Universit', 'eacute', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'Universit', 'eacute', 'Paris', 'Panth', 'eacute', 'Sorbonne']",N/A
508872,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B00000K0E2,J. B. Hoyos,"[7, 7]","""Fade to Black"" is one of the most thought provoking horror films I've seen in a long time.  From the creative minds who brought us ""Halloween"" and ""Hell Night, comes another slasher flick.  This one, however, is unique in that it serves as a social commentary on the influence of movies, especially horror, on troubled young minds.Eric Binford is a loner with no friends who spends too much time watching movies on television and at the theatre.  He actually tells this girl he's just met that he watched three movies a day for an entire year.  Add to the fact that he is constantly surrounded by people who psychologically and physically abuse him and you have a bomb that could explode at any minute.  When Eric does become mentally unhinged, he disguises himself as vampires, mummies, bandits, gangsters and other villains and begins murdering his enemies in creative ways that mimic the movies he has loved to watch.Dennis Christopher is excellent as the downtrodden Eric who lives with his abusive, crippled aunt.  The viewer feels much sympathy for his plight even though he brings a lot of his troubles upon himself, like most humans do.  (You might say that a little bit of Eric Binford is in all of us.)  There is a hazy line between reality and fantasy, between sanity and insanity.  Eric has definitely crossed that line, which leads to tragic consequences.  The ending is very sad and disheartening.""Fade to Black"" reminded me of the horror masterpiece ""Theatre of Blood"" in which Vincent Price is an actor who is very much immersed in Shakespearean plays.  He also kills his enemies - reviewers who have constantly rejected his acting - according to these plays.When stressed, we all have a tendency to slip into fantasy in order to relieve tension.  We have to learn when not to stay in fantasy too long and become forever trapped there like Eric Binford.  We must confront our problems instead of running from them.""Fade to Black"" is highly recommended for those who love slasher ficks of the eighties and for those, like me, who watch too many horror movies in general.  This film will make you think, it will make you analyze your own life, but, most of all, it will make you glad you're not Eric Binford.  His life is like a movie reel that has come to an end and the screen must now FADE TO BLACK.Anchor Bay did an excellent job of restoring and releasing this film in its original widescreen theatrical aspect of 1.85:1.  A theatrical trailer has been provided.  In lieu of commentary, there is a movie poster replica and brief liner notes on the cast and crew.

508875,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B00000K0E2,Michael R Gates,"[7, 9]","BREAKING AWAY's (1979) Dennis Christopher stars in FADE TO BLACK, a wry comment on how Hollywood is gaining influence over the worldview of the average citizen in contemporary Western society.  Christopher plays Eric Binford, a young man so obsessed with the cinema that he soon begins to blur the line between reality and the plots of his favorite motion pictures.  As his life begins to unravel, Eric looks to the movies for the solutions to his problems, and of course, it's only a matter of time before Eric starts eliminating those &quot;problems&quot; following the example of his favorite movie characters--with murder!Christopher's over-the-top performance is exuberant and flamboyant, but since his Eric Binford is a person whose behavior is governed by the cinema, such a performance makes the character seem both plausible and sympathetic.  Another strong performance is offered by Linda Kerridge as Marilyn O'Connor, the object of Eric's unrequited love.  (Of course, it helps that Kerridge, a former Australian model, is a very convincing Marilyn Monroe look-alike, a fact that is intricately weaved into the plotline.)Admittedly, the supporting cast is not nearly as strong as Christopher and Kerridge, and a great deal of the dialogue for minor characters is pure caricature.  Indeed, if taken too seriously, FADE TO BLACK will come across as cartoonish and the plot will seem outlandish.  But if viewed as the Juvenalian satire it is meant to be, the film definitely works.  Cinema buffs will enjoy the clips from old classics, and horror fans will get a real kick out of watching Eric commit acts of mayhem and murder while costumed as Dracula and The Mummy.Viewers who do not appreciate dark satire--and especially those who do not enjoy thriller films--will probably regard FADE TO BLACK as made-for-TV fodder.  True, it is not destined to be a classic.  But it is definitely an entertaining film, and it's a genuinely fun ride for cinema buffs and devotees of the horror and thriller genres.",3,All the World's a Stage,1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,2011,"['BREAKING', 'AWAY', '1979', 'Dennis', 'Christopher', 'stars', 'FADE', 'TO', 'BLACK', 'wry', 'comment', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'gaining', 'influence', 'worldview', 'average', 'citizen', 'contemporary', 'Western', 'society', 'Christopher', 'Eric', 'Binford', 'young', 'man', 'so', 'obsessed', 'cinema', 'soon', 'blur', 'line', 'reality', 'plots', 'favorite', 'motion', 'pictures', 'life', 'unravel', 'Eric', 'movies', 'solutions', 'problems', 'course', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'Eric', 'eliminating', 'quot', 'problems', 'quot', 'following', 'example', 'favorite', 'movie', 'characters', 'murder', 'Christopher', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'exuberant', 'flamboyant', 'Eric', 'Binford', 'person', 'behavior', 'governed', 'cinema', 'performance', 'character', 'seem', 'plausible', 'sympathetic', 'strong', 'performance', 'offered', 'Linda', 'Kerridge', 'Marilyn', ""O'Connor"", 'object', 'Eric', 'unrequited', 'love', 'course', 'Kerridge', 'former', 'Australian', 'model', 'very', 'convincing', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'look-alike', 'fact', 'intricately', 'weaved', 'plotline', 'Admittedly', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'strong', 'Christopher', 'Kerridge', 'great', 'deal', 'dialogue', 'minor', 'characters', 'pure', 'caricature', 'Indeed', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'FADE', 'TO', 'BLACK', 'will', 'come', 'cartoonish', 'plot', 'will', 'seem', 'outlandish', 'viewed', 'Juvenalian', 'satire', 'meant', 'be', 'film', 'definitely', 'Cinema', 'buffs', 'will', 'enjoy', 'clips', 'old', 'classics', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'get', 'real', 'kick', 'watching', 'Eric', 'commit', 'acts', 'mayhem', 'murder', 'while', 'costumed', 'Dracula', 'Mummy.Viewers', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'appreciate', 'dark', 'satire', 'especially', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'thriller', 'films', 'will', 'probably', 'regard', 'FADE', 'TO', 'BLACK', 'made-for-TV', 'fodder', 'True', 'not', 'destined', 'be', 'classic', 'definitely', 'entertaining', 'film', 'genuinely', 'fun', 'ride', 'cinema', 'buffs', 'devotees', 'horror', 'thriller', 'genres']",N/A
