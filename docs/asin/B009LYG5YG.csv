I absolutely love this type of movie:  found footage, aliens, Roswell-connection, etc.  This one, however, is patently ludicrous.  I'll try not to include any spoilers, but trust me when I say that most of this amateur-hour flick makes zero sense.  First of all, the U.S. government would never allow what this couple finds in the mysterious barn to stay there.  As if a rickety, dilapidated barn with a padlock on the door is going to protect history-making secrets from making it to the public at large.  Second of all, the make-up effects are hilarious -- lots or rubbery-looking things that make the muppets look like real animals.  The acting was also a joke, not to mention the script and the relationship between the main characters (why this dim-bulb would propose to his girl in his sweaty t-shirt first thing in the morning in his gradma's breakfast nook is an absolute mystery).  Anyway, don't be swayed by the stellar reviews for this nonsense.  You'd do a lot better watching something like the Wicksboro Incident or Grave Encounters or even The Fourth Kind.  These are also subpar found footage flicks, but compared to Unaware, they're like Close Encounters of the Third Kind-quality.  I was so disappointed.

Whenever I see a rave review, I always check to see if the reviewer has posted any other reviews of other Amazon purchases.

Frankly, I found ""Downton Abbey"" more frightening. There literally was not a moment when I was the least bit spooked in this film.The film is about a couple who go out to visit the guy's grandparents. They drive for a bit and nothing happens. Then they hang out for a bit at the house and nothing happens. Then they go to the garage and they hear an electric hum, but nothing happens. They go back to the house for a while and nothing happens. They go back to the garage, poke around for a bit, see a rubber mask and, like Scooby Do and Shaggy they run in terror from a rubber mask. Then they sit around for a bit and nothing happens.You get the idea. There is a whole lot of nothing in this movie.The film refers to other films such as ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Friday the 13th"". One common trait those two films have is that they are both much better and much scarier than ""Unaware"".Seriously, this movie feels like a group of friends got together one weekend, bought a rubber mask, and decided to improvise a movie. They reason it's called ""Unaware"", I hypothesize, is how unaware I was of its quality when I rented it.So if it's so bad, why did I give it two stars instead of one? Because I thought the lead actors both showed genuine potential.

1598826,A1UEW0GN2JOK5B,B009LYG5YG,Jes,"[0, 1]","Mid range found footage film.  Not the best, not the worst.  Netflix, steam, rent, just don't buy.Sometimes, a movie drags on and you don't mind it.  Then, there are movies like this one... where the first 15 odd minutes is just the couple babbling in the car.  15 minutes is excessively long for this particular mechanic and nothing useful was even discussed besides a few tidbits about grandpa that could have been covered in a 30 second chat.  If you have a part of the film the audience wants to fast forward through, you're doing it wrong.Of course, the rest of the film similarly drags on, but at least they toss in the occasional &#34;mystery&#34; moment where one or both of the pair see or notice something out of place to take the viewer out of the haze.  Like many such films, the last 15-20 minutes is the money shot.  Not much, but after such abysmal pacing before it, any change of pace is welcome.  A cracker to a starving man, if you will.There were minor things that bugged me, but I wouldn't hold it against the film, just my own personal preferences.  Things like:  When you open a gate on a driveway in the country, you are supposed to close it behind you.  Just common courtesy and you would be respectful to your grandparent's home.  Small, minor details, but if you spent time out in farmland, you notice.  Also, the 'editing' trick, where the screen loops and goes to static... stop that.  I really don't need a blast of static ringing out from my surround sound just as I turned it up to hear their conversation.  I expect that type of thing to blur out the aliens or whatever, not when they are just chatting.  That was annoying.Worth a watch, a rent, a stream, whatever.  Wouldn't buy it....
