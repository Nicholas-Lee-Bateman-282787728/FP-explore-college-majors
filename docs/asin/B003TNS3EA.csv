Story could have proceeded with momma pony still be alive.  Hate it whenever an animal dies in a movie.  But it is a nice, family oriented movie otherwise.  Those of us who choose to believe in elves, fairies, unicorns and dragons (I'm 69 but still a child at heart) will surely enjoy the movie.  I viewed it through Amazon Prime for free and would like to say that having a Prime account has proved well worth the cost to me.",4,Fantasy Fun for the Kid in all of us,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,527,"['agree', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'wish', 'scene', 'mother', 'pony', 'dying', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'Story', 'could', 'have', 'proceeded', 'momma', 'pony', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'Hate', 'whenever', 'animal', 'dies', 'movie', 'nice', 'family', 'oriented', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'who', 'choose', 'believe', 'elves', 'fairies', 'unicorns', 'dragons', ""'m"", '69', 'still', 'child', 'heart', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'viewed', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'free', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'having', 'Prime', 'account', 'proved', 'well', 'cost']",N/A

A single mom and her boy learn what it is to love in ways they never expect!!  Not a big budget movie, but a good movie to spend time with your kids.

1362276,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B003TNS3EA,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]",This is a wonderful tale of a young boy with a physical handicap who discovers the power of friendship and loyalty when his pony gives birth to a unicorn. There are some kissing scenes here involving the boy's mom and her policeman boyfriend but nothing overly graphic. There is also a tense scene involving a mountain lion attacking the pony.The movie is Not Rated and runs 95 minutes. I'd recommend this film for children ages 6-10.,4,The power of friendship and loyalty,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,434,"['wonderful', 'tale', 'young', 'boy', 'physical', 'handicap', 'who', 'power', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'when', 'pony', 'birth', 'unicorn', 'are', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'here', 'involving', 'boy', 'mom', 'policeman', 'boyfriend', 'nothing', 'overly', 'graphic', 'also', 'tense', 'scene', 'involving', 'mountain', 'lion', 'attacking', 'pony.The', 'movie', 'Not', 'Rated', '95', 'minutes', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'children', 'ages', '6-10']",N/A
