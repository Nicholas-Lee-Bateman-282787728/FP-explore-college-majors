Gene Hackman plays a private eye who is under utilized in his career (he plays an ex-Oakland Raider in the movie) and is also in the middle of discovering that his marriage is falling apart. (I thought it was interesting how Hackman used his private eye skills to spy on his wife while she was cheating on him.) Hackman's character accepts a seemingly open and shut runaway case (to bring home Melanie Griffith's character) that is nowhere near as simple as it seems. The plot line takes so many twists and turns it does get confusing, but it never gets boring. Overall, I thought Gene Hackman did a great job in this movie, and there were also good performances from the supporting cast. It was fun to see Melanie Griffith and James Woods so early in their careers too. The DVD was worth buying and also has footage on the making of the film.",4,Definitely an overlooked movie...,1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,950,"['movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'took', 'few', 'watches', 'get', 'feel', 'way', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'private', 'eye', 'who', 'utilized', 'career', 'ex-Oakland', 'Raider', 'movie', 'also', 'middle', 'discovering', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'how', 'Hackman', 'used', 'private', 'eye', 'skills', 'spy', 'wife', 'was', 'cheating', 'Hackman', 'character', 'seemingly', 'open', 'shut', 'runaway', 'case', 'bring', 'home', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'character', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'simple', 'plot', 'line', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'get', 'confusing', 'never', 'boring', 'Overall', 'thought', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'were', 'also', 'good', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'James', 'Woods', 'so', 'early', 'careers', 'too', 'DVD', 'was', 'worth', 'buying', 'also', 'footage', 'making', 'film']",N/A
232978,A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,630026887X,"Bill Your 'Free Form FM Print DJ ""bill nicholas""","[4, 4]","Poor Harry Mosby, retired Oakland Raider turned detective. His father left him when he was a little kid. All these years later, he finds out his wife is cheating.To get away from family problems, he flies from Los Angeles to Florida to look for the missing teen daughter of a haggard Hollywood starlet. He finds the permiscuous girl, has an affair with the women taking care of her, and meanwhile, uncovers a smuggling ring.All of this is done in Night Moves 70s style. Fimled in 1973, the dialouge in the film has the sharp, hip momentum.  Sex is now out in the open, and  the middle class is absorbing a new cultural attitude. Even the straight charactors do and they say things that they never would have in 1969. Watergate was in full swing. People knew the rules had changed, and were not changing back.If your into period style, yes, everybody is walking around with thick moustaches, sideburns, turtlenecks and blazers. Going one better, the entire score of the film is done on a Fender Rhodes electric panio.But it is Gene Hackman's Mosby who makes Night Moves. He is a gentle giant. He only strikes when attacked, shown by his refusal to hit his wife's lover, or her when she is unrepentant about her daliance. The teenage girl he is looking for, and locates, comes on to him, but he does not accept her advances. He, however, does give her fatherly comfort when she has a nightmare. The hurt kid in Mosby connects with the hurt kid he finds.Mosby is smart, and knows deep down that he is capable of more than the work he does. But he is trapped by a relentless impulse to track people down--people who he displaces for his father.He is always intent on the truth, except when it comes to facing his emotions. When he gets to the bottom of things, he never likes what he discovers.  His behvaior reveals his sweet,wounded character.Hackman is perfect at this and the rest of the cast are also perfect. But the film isn't. The most dynamic drama in Night Moves occurs in LA, particually between Harry and his wife. His sojurn to Florida changes the visual and dramatic texture of the film. The sequence there is long, and the screws of the film loosen just when they should tighten. Keeping the action close to home would have been a plausealbe option--who said the missing girl had to be across the country? It would have been more dramatic to keep all the events of the film in a small space, and keep the tention between the Mosbys cooking.Still, this has some great acting and works as a period piece.

232979,A3EJZJQCMRRFT2,630026887X,Brian J. Mcmahon,"[2, 4]","I've always been a bit of a Gene Hackman fan so I picked up this movie since it had been mentioned in other movie reviews. It contains a very young Melanie Griffith and a very young James Woods in the cast. At first the movie revolves around trying to find the Griffith character and return her to her home. However a series of rather weird characters and events turn the movie into a bit of a far-fetched mystery. There is also a backdrop of Hackmans wife cheating on him and he does a little cheating himself. The interactions between Hackman and the man his wife is cheating on him with are rather unrealistic, I assume this backdrop is intended to give Hackman an excuse to be drawn into a little cheating himself. The ending is anti-climatic, abrubt, and far-fetched. The production and directing is competent, as is the acting by most of the cast. In one scene, Hackman drives away from a family erupted into a huge arguement on their driveway. The scene is particularly ridiculous, but then again quite realistic. Hackman does a great job of conveying the absurdity of what the audience is witnessing.If you like Gene Hackman, this DVD is worth adding to your collection. Although the story and situations within are pretty far outside the bounds of realistic and the plot will sometimes leave your head spinning, it's worth a view. By the way, Night Moves is supposed to refer to a chess sequence that is discussed in the movie, so it might be more aptly titled Knight Moves.",3,Interesting look at a low budget movie from the 70's,1166140800,"12 15, 2006",2006,1483,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'bit', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'so', 'picked', 'up', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'mentioned', 'other', 'movie', 'reviews', 'very', 'young', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'very', 'young', 'James', 'Woods', 'cast', 'first', 'movie', 'around', 'trying', 'find', 'Griffith', 'character', 'return', 'home', 'However', 'series', 'rather', 'weird', 'characters', 'events', 'turn', 'movie', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'mystery', 'also', 'backdrop', 'Hackmans', 'wife', 'cheating', 'little', 'cheating', 'interactions', 'Hackman', 'man', 'wife', 'cheating', 'are', 'rather', 'unrealistic', 'assume', 'backdrop', 'intended', 'give', 'Hackman', 'excuse', 'be', 'drawn', 'little', 'cheating', 'ending', 'anti-climatic', 'abrubt', 'far-fetched', 'production', 'directing', 'competent', 'acting', 'most', 'cast', 'one', 'scene', 'Hackman', 'away', 'family', 'erupted', 'huge', 'arguement', 'driveway', 'scene', 'particularly', 'ridiculous', 'then', 'again', 'quite', 'realistic', 'Hackman', 'great', 'job', 'conveying', 'absurdity', 'what', 'audience', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'DVD', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'story', 'situations', 'are', 'pretty', 'far', 'bounds', 'realistic', 'plot', 'will', 'sometimes', 'leave', 'head', 'spinning', 'view', 'way', 'Night', 'Moves', 'supposed', 'refer', 'chess', 'sequence', 'discussed', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'aptly', 'titled', 'Knight', 'Moves']",N/A
232980,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,630026887X,C. O. DeRiemer,"[8, 8]","Harry Moseby is a private investigator with a marriage that's falling apart and an unwillingness to deal with his own personal issues. He used to play pro ball for Oakland; now he gets by with divorce work. He likes to solve chess problems. He's smarter than you think. One day he gets a call from a friend who says he's got a case for Harry. A 16-year-old girl, daughter of an alcoholic former small-time movie star and a deceased Hollywood mogul, has run away. Harry tracks the teenager down to an island off Florida and the home of her stepfather, Tom Iverson. Iverson and his wife, Paula, run a small charter boat operation. The days are filled with hot sunshine. The nights with puzzles and temptations. Harry intends to return the girl to her mother, but lands up to his eyes in murder, Hollywood stunt men, stolen Mexican artifacts and emotional betrayal.Night Moves stars Gene Hackman as Moseby. It's one of his best roles. Arthur Penn directed and I'd put it up there with Penn's best. Several things make this movie so good. First is the coherence of a complicated story. At times Moseby is a step or two ahead of us. Some times we're a step or two ahead of Moseby. The solution, however, comes as a logical but surprising revelation to both Moseby and us. All the elements were there if we'd only noticed them. Penn's direction keeps us engrossed in the story and in the action. Even when Moseby is dealing with his wife who is having an affair, in part because of Moseby's own emotional distance, Penn keeps us involved and looking forward to the next part of the story.Equally important, Night Moves features some first rate actors whom we believe in as their characters. After Hackman is Jennifer Warren as Paula Iverson, a complicated mixture of honesty and evasion. Paula is edgy, with a quick mouth and ping pong talk. She looks straight at you when she challenges you. Edward Binns as an aging stuntman gives another fine performance. He's tired, experienced and has seen it all. Melanie Griffith as Delly, the run-away sex nymphet, gives an excellent performance in her first billed role. She was 18 when she made the movie. Strong performances also are given by John Crawford as Tom Iverson, Janet Ward as Delly's usually drunk mother who is dependent on Delly's trust fund, Susan Clark as Harry's wife, Harris Yulin as her lover and James Woods as a repellant mechanic.The movie steadily builds tension and interest as Harry tracks Delly down and meets Paula and Tom Iverson. Then one night Paula takes Delly for a late night swim and Harry decides to tag along. Delly strips off and dives in nude while Harry looks uncomfortable and Paula just smiles. Then Delly comes up screaming. Paula turns on the underwater lights and they peer through the glass bottom. Not too far down in the water they can see the remains of a small plane. In the cabin, fish are still nibbling at what's left of the pilot's face. At this point the movie picks up a lot of steam, with Harry determined to find out what's going on. The end of the movie is violent and surprisingly poignant. Night Moves is a movie worth having.The DVD transfer looks just fine, maybe a little soft. There is one light-weight extra called The Day of the Director about Penn. It didn't seem worth sitting through.",5,"An Excellent Arthur Penn/Gene Hackman Mystery, With A Violent, Poignant Ending",1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,3291,"['Harry', 'Moseby', 'private', 'investigator', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart', 'unwillingness', 'deal', 'own', 'personal', 'issues', 'used', 'play', 'pro', 'ball', 'Oakland', 'now', 'divorce', 'work', 'solve', 'chess', 'problems', 'smarter', 'think', 'One', 'day', 'call', 'friend', 'who', 'got', 'case', 'Harry', '16-year-old', 'girl', 'daughter', 'alcoholic', 'former', 'small-time', 'movie', 'star', 'deceased', 'Hollywood', 'mogul', 'run', 'away', 'Harry', 'teenager', 'down', 'island', 'Florida', 'home', 'stepfather', 'Tom', 'Iverson', 'Iverson', 'wife', 'Paula', 'run', 'small', 'charter', 'boat', 'operation', 'days', 'are', 'filled', 'hot', 'sunshine', 'nights', 'puzzles', 'temptations', 'Harry', 'return', 'girl', 'mother', 'up', 'eyes', 'murder', 'Hollywood', 'stunt', 'men', 'stolen', 'Mexican', 'artifacts', 'emotional', 'betrayal.Night', 'Moves', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Moseby', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'Arthur', 'Penn', 'directed', ""'d"", 'put', 'up', 'there', 'Penn', 'best', 'Several', 'things', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'First', 'coherence', 'complicated', 'story', 'times', 'Moseby', 'step', 'two', 'ahead', 'times', ""'re"", 'step', 'two', 'ahead', 'Moseby', 'solution', 'however', 'logical', 'surprising', 'revelation', 'Moseby', 'elements', 'were', 'there', ""'d"", 'only', 'noticed', 'Penn', 'direction', 'engrossed', 'story', 'action', 'Even', 'when', 'Moseby', 'dealing', 'wife', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'part', 'Moseby', 'own', 'emotional', 'distance', 'Penn', 'involved', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'part', 'story.Equally', 'important', 'Night', 'Moves', 'first', 'rate', 'actors', 'whom', 'believe', 'characters', 'Hackman', 'Jennifer', 'Warren', 'Paula', 'Iverson', 'complicated', 'mixture', 'honesty', 'evasion', 'Paula', 'edgy', 'quick', 'mouth', 'ping', 'pong', 'talk', 'straight', 'when', 'Edward', 'Binns', 'aging', 'stuntman', 'fine', 'performance', 'tired', 'experienced', 'seen', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'Delly', 'run-away', 'sex', 'nymphet', 'excellent', 'performance', 'first', 'billed', 'role', 'was', '18', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'Strong', 'performances', 'also', 'are', 'given', 'John', 'Crawford', 'Tom', 'Iverson', 'Janet', 'Ward', 'Delly', 'usually', 'mother', 'who', 'dependent', 'Delly', 'trust', 'fund', 'Susan', 'Clark', 'Harry', 'wife', 'Harris', 'Yulin', 'lover', 'James', 'Woods', 'repellant', 'mechanic.The', 'movie', 'steadily', 'tension', 'interest', 'Harry', 'Delly', 'down', 'meets', 'Paula', 'Tom', 'Iverson', 'Then', 'one', 'night', 'Paula', 'Delly', 'late', 'night', 'swim', 'Harry', 'tag', 'along', 'Delly', 'dives', 'nude', 'Harry', 'uncomfortable', 'Paula', 'just', 'smiles', 'Then', 'Delly', 'up', 'screaming', 'Paula', 'underwater', 'lights', 'peer', 'glass', 'bottom', 'Not', 'too', 'far', 'down', 'water', 'can', 'see', 'remains', 'small', 'plane', 'cabin', 'fish', 'are', 'still', 'nibbling', 'what', 'left', 'pilot', 'face', 'point', 'movie', 'up', 'lot', 'steam', 'Harry', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'end', 'movie', 'violent', 'surprisingly', 'poignant', 'Night', 'Moves', 'movie', 'having.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'just', 'fine', 'maybe', 'little', 'soft', 'one', 'light-weight', 'extra', 'called', 'Day', 'Director', 'Penn', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'worth', 'sitting']",N/A

NIGHT MOVES (mystery-thriller, 1975) Private detective Harry Moseby (Gene Hackman) is hired by ex-model-turned-actress Arlene to find her 16-year old daughter, Delly (Melanie Griffith). After provoking a fight  with 2 of her boyfriends she disappeared. Moseby finds Delly living with  her stepfather in the Florida Keys. Before bringing her home, they discover  the remains of an airplane sunk in the waters and a body inside later  identified as one of Delly's boyfriends. Back in LA Moseby is surprised  that Delly has also died in an auto wreck. Suspecting a connection between  the 2 deaths his search leads him to a stolen statue that was lost at sea,  close to where the plan was found. With a possible motive, Moseby goes  after the killers.Critique: Tough, sometimes confusing thriller packs  surefire acting, direction (by Arthur Penn) that is reminiscent of the  classic film-noir of 40s and 50s crime flicks. Gene Hackman's private  detective is a variation on the Sam Spade and Mike Hammer's of that era.  Yet again, Hackman's performance keeps the film interesting and exciting.  His intense search uncovers perversity even in the most unlikely of places.  He has a great 'domestic' scene that involves the idea that his wife is  cheating on him. Unlike &quot;hardboiled dicks&quot; of the era though, his  character shows more compassion. 18-year-old Melanie Griffith's debut is  also a standout as a tawdry (femme fatale?) whose youthful promiscuity has  an attractive sexuality.QUOTE: Delly: &quot;I like being patted like  that.

A mystery in reverse, thematically speaking.The detective, Harry Moseby (Gene Hackman), admits near the end that ""I didn't solve anything,"" and he's half correct. The final shot of a helpless boat going round in circles, solitary on the sea, is a perfect metaphor for this film's sullen aftereffect.At one point a character asks Moseby if he remembers where he was when Kennedy was shot, and Moseby replies, ""Which Kennedy?"" When the woman just shrugs and says, ""Any Kennedy,"" you feel the the moral weariness of the time and place like a damp, heavy coat.Gene Hackman is arguably the most watchable actor we have, and Melanie Griffith is worth catching, too, in this, her film debut.If you don't mind a mystery that poses as many questions as it answers, ""Night Moves"" is a treat.

232983,A2RY1N6F1JB9WA,630026887X,Daniel J. Staggers,"[3, 7]","Ha, years ago when the Internet was young, I got a video short of a young Melony Griffith naked in the ocean. Meanwhile a man and women were watching her through the bottom (glass) of a boat making funny comments. I kept that video short thinking one day, I'll try to figure out which movie it is, buy it, and perhaps see more of Melony's beautiful body in her prime.  Years and years went by; I didn't know I still had it.Fast forward: I was cleaning out old files and stumbled on the old video short. Hmm, this movie is old enough that I didn't recognize Gene Hackman (too much hair, and mellow voice). So with today's Internet tools so advanced, I did a search on Melony figuring the movie had to be one of her first. (she's about 16 or 17 in the movie) I found this title that way only because Gene's name is Harry and the movie synopsis named the title character Harry. So, I bought the movie, in part because of a naked Melony, and in part because it's Gene Hackman. (whom I've always liked)What a pleasant surprise this movie is! It's a classic murder ""who done it"" with many bodies piling up. Melony's nude scenes were completely innocent as she plays a girl who's quite used to being naked and not really one to like clothing. Typically, she's a teenage seductive of older men which doesn't work on Gene. This creates a very interesting plot line, and why she gets ""loose with the clothes"" in an innocent way.

There were many conspiracy saturated films after Watergate but Penns film is perhaps even darker because it finds the seed of corruption in every aspect of American life .  Everyone is in some way morally compromised and if not yet corrupt getting very near to being so. And they start young. A very young Melanie Griffith plays the runaway teen who seems perfectly capable of finding her way as well as getting her way and doesn't really need any finding. Gene Hackman plays the detective doing the family a favor. And James Woods plays what at first seems like a villainous role but there are no easy gradations in this film. Everything and everyone operates in their own grey area. There is no high ground.The locations are perfectly chosen. L.A. and the Florida Keys each have a wonderfully seedy resonance in any film goers mind. The locations are wonderful surfaces which barely conceal the  dirty secrets seething just below the water line.  Hackman tracks Griffith from L.A. to the Keys and there encounters the very sexy drop out Jennifer Warren living in tropic squalor mixed up in the trafficking of all kinds of strange cargo. The plot is complex to describe but all is very competently put together into a flawlessly structured whole by the great Arthur Penn.

232992,A30T2B7RFWGYNU,630026887X,FRED C. DOBBS,"[2, 2]","Tawdry, 70's head-scratcher of a detective flick with Gene Hackman playing a private investigator [PI] getting big bucks for locating the flighty 16-year old daughter of an affluent ex-actress. Concurrently, the ex-football star is getting two-timed by his wife with a guy who has a gimpy leg. Melanie Griffith plays the rowdy, promiscuous and itinerant teen, reprising her similar [and memorable] role opposite Paul Newman in THE DROWNING POOL earlier that same year of of 1975. Susan Clark [with Clint Eastwood in COOGAN'S BLUFF, 1968] plays Hackman's unfulfilled and ambivalent spouse.Hackman's search for the teen takes him from trendy suburban LA and a lot of stuntmen pals to the bedraggled Florida Keys where the kid is holed up with her step-dad and his lady friend in a trashy shore house. The dad, a puffy, glib, overly-congenial maritimer is played particularly well by vet actor John Crawford---his specious manner and veiled virulence sensed throughout. A strikingly attractive Jennifer Warren plays the oddball and enigmatic lady friend---your're never sure if she's just being coy and furtive or if she has serious mental health issues, or both---a very cool and crafty performance.The teen adamently refuses to return to LA with Hackman but changes her mind when she comes upon a corpse while diving off the Keys. The PI comforts the shaken, bawling teen that night, the big lug showing he has a soft spot and realizing that his target is just a deprived, neglected and probably misguided child. Also probably vicariously comforting himself as much in the lives of both teen and PI seem to run in parallel: both victims of abandonment, betrayal and sexual deviancy [incest versus adultery], and both having few and tenuous supports. Each of their lives is devoid of loyalty, fidelity or truth. The kid runs on hormones and reflexes while Hackman is actuated by job, pride and ego. Both are pawns in the lives of others: the teen by her narcissistic, self-serving mom and Hackman by his spouse, friends and clients.Once back in LA the teen is killed in a rather reckless auto mishap involving a stunt car. A shaken Hackman confronts the kid's mom, accusing her of abandonment and of using her daughter for personal gain. You always sympathize with nice-guy Hackman, the childless ex-jock getting blindsided by his spouse with a literally lame 'sideliner' yet able to empathize with, and willing to procure justice for, a deluded kid---and he has an admirable work ethic.One key scene has Hackman telling his wife about the time he tracked down the father he never knew. He found his dad sitting on a bench one day but could not get himself to approach or confront him, deciding to just walk away. Interesting paradox of a detective, whose job is to find the truth about people, not able to face the truth about himself: not wanting to know how his father will react or why his spouse has sought fulfillment in another. It's that common fear that we all have: despite vocations, roles and accomplishments which we often subjectively feel have been successfully implemented, the latter may not be the case. We often fear objective truth as the pain it can cause could impair our ability to function.Hackman, who has a liking for playing chess, finally gets his fill of all the nonsense and dead ends and deduces that all the weird characters around him [including spouse] are playing HIM---faking him out with lies, money, hospitality, pats on the back and even sex. The diversion is short-lived, however, as the savvy PI is finally able to abrogate the fun stuff and focus on facts, motives and behavior in his search for the truth.You'll get a kick out of seeing a very young James Woods as the teen's freaky, on-and-off, boyfriend. I think this film will be interesting to fans of those sexually frank and offbeat, late 60's/early 70's, watershed detective flicks like TONY ROME [1967], THE DETECTIVE [1968] and THE DROWNING POOL [1975]---the very best of these being CHINATOWN [1974].",4,SEARCHING FOR THE TRUTH IS OFTEN EASIER THAN FACING IT,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,4001,"['Tawdry', '70', 'head-scratcher', 'detective', 'flick', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'playing', 'private', 'investigator', '[', 'PI', ']', 'getting', 'big', 'bucks', 'locating', 'flighty', '16-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'affluent', 'ex-actress', 'Concurrently', 'ex-football', 'star', 'getting', 'two-timed', 'wife', 'guy', 'who', 'gimpy', 'leg', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'rowdy', 'promiscuous', 'itinerant', 'teen', 'reprising', 'similar', '[', 'memorable', ']', 'role', 'opposite', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'THE', 'DROWNING', 'POOL', 'earlier', 'same', 'year', '1975', 'Susan', 'Clark', '[', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'COOGAN', 'BLUFF', '1968', ']', 'Hackman', 'unfulfilled', 'ambivalent', 'spouse.Hackman', 'search', 'teen', 'trendy', 'suburban', 'LA', 'lot', 'stuntmen', 'pals', 'bedraggled', 'Florida', 'Keys', 'where', 'kid', 'holed', 'up', 'step-dad', 'lady', 'friend', 'trashy', 'shore', 'house', 'dad', 'puffy', 'glib', 'overly-congenial', 'maritimer', 'played', 'particularly', 'well', 'vet', 'actor', 'John', 'Crawford', '-his', 'specious', 'manner', 'veiled', 'virulence', 'sensed', 'strikingly', 'attractive', 'Jennifer', 'Warren', 'oddball', 'enigmatic', 'lady', 'friend', '-your', ""'re"", 'never', 'sure', 'just', 'being', 'coy', 'furtive', 'serious', 'mental', 'health', 'issues', '-a', 'very', 'cool', 'crafty', 'performance.The', 'teen', 'adamently', 'return', 'LA', 'Hackman', 'mind', 'when', 'corpse', 'diving', 'off', 'Keys', 'PI', 'shaken', 'bawling', 'teen', 'night', 'big', 'lug', 'showing', 'soft', 'spot', 'realizing', 'target', 'just', 'deprived', 'neglected', 'probably', 'misguided', 'child', 'Also', 'probably', 'vicariously', 'comforting', 'much', 'lives', 'teen', 'PI', 'seem', 'run', 'parallel', 'victims', 'abandonment', 'betrayal', 'sexual', 'deviancy', '[', 'incest', 'versus', 'adultery', ']', 'having', 'few', 'tenuous', 'supports', 'lives', 'devoid', 'loyalty', 'fidelity', 'truth', 'kid', 'hormones', 'reflexes', 'Hackman', 'actuated', 'job', 'pride', 'ego', 'are', 'pawns', 'lives', 'others', 'teen', 'narcissistic', 'self-serving', 'mom', 'Hackman', 'spouse', 'friends', 'clients.Once', 'back', 'LA', 'teen', 'killed', 'rather', 'reckless', 'auto', 'mishap', 'involving', 'stunt', 'car', 'shaken', 'Hackman', 'kid', 'mom', 'accusing', 'abandonment', 'using', 'daughter', 'personal', 'gain', 'always', 'sympathize', 'nice-guy', 'Hackman', 'childless', 'ex-jock', 'getting', 'blindsided', 'spouse', 'literally', 'lame', ""'sideliner"", 'yet', 'able', 'empathize', 'willing', 'procure', 'justice', 'deluded', 'kid', '-and', 'admirable', 'work', 'ethic.One', 'key', 'scene', 'Hackman', 'telling', 'wife', 'time', 'tracked', 'down', 'father', 'never', 'knew', 'found', 'dad', 'sitting', 'bench', 'one', 'day', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'approach', 'confront', 'deciding', 'just', 'walk', 'away', 'Interesting', 'paradox', 'detective', 'job', 'find', 'truth', 'people', 'not', 'able', 'face', 'truth', 'not', 'wanting', 'know', 'how', 'father', 'will', 'react', 'why', 'spouse', 'sought', 'fulfillment', 'common', 'fear', 'have', 'vocations', 'roles', 'accomplishments', 'often', 'subjectively', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'successfully', 'implemented', 'latter', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'often', 'fear', 'objective', 'truth', 'pain', 'can', 'cause', 'could', 'impair', 'ability', 'function.Hackman', 'who', 'liking', 'playing', 'chess', 'finally', 'fill', 'nonsense', 'dead', 'ends', 'deduces', 'weird', 'characters', '[', 'including', 'spouse', ']', 'are', 'playing', 'HIM', '-faking', 'out', 'lies', 'money', 'hospitality', 'pats', 'back', 'even', 'sex', 'diversion', 'short-lived', 'however', 'savvy', 'PI', 'finally', 'able', 'abrogate', 'fun', 'stuff', 'focus', 'facts', 'motives', 'behavior', 'search', 'truth.You', ""'ll"", 'get', 'kick', 'seeing', 'very', 'young', 'James', 'Woods', 'teen', 'freaky', 'on-and-off', 'boyfriend', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'fans', 'sexually', 'frank', 'offbeat', 'late', ""60's/early"", '70', 'watershed', 'detective', 'flicks', 'TONY', 'ROME', '[', '1967', ']', 'THE', 'DETECTIVE', '[', '1968', ']', 'THE', 'DROWNING', 'POOL', '[', '1975', ']', '-the', 'very', 'best', 'being', 'CHINATOWN', '[', '1974', ']']",N/A

One of Hackman's nods was for the fairly obvious choice,French Connection II. Most people would not come close to guessing that the other was for Arthur Penn's own detective film, Night Moves.I have a soft spot for gritty 1970s dramas, and I especially enjoy finding hidden gems. But my initial reaction here was one of disappointment. The closest film I can think of is the exponentially more brilliantChinatown. I always enjoy Hackman, but even he was better in the little-known but excellentThe Conversationor obviously the firstThe French Connection.While amateur film scholarRonald Schwartzis correct in noting that, ""Harry Moseby is a man with limitations and weaknesses,"" the imperfect anti-hero was played well by others during this period of resurgence in neo-noir. Neither Jack Nicholson's Jake Gittes nor Hackman's own (other) Harry in The Conversation know much about anything. As in Night Moves, neither can prevent bad things from happening to the people they work for.Hackman does a good job here (as usual) but the film overall is simply not as compelling as some of the other vintage detective pieces. And what did the football player angle add? Nothing IMO.

The other is a line about a snake in a woodpile that I can't repeat because it's obscene.I think this film is too ambiguous at times. Some people compare it to Chinatown, but it reminded me a little of Altman's The Long Goodbye. Hackman too seems like a traditional gumshoe trying make sense and meaning out of 1970's LA, though Hackman's travels take him to Key West as well. One character in the movie quickly compares him to Sam Spade.Hackman, unlike Gould in Altman's film, seems like he's bumbling and blustering his way through situations he only half-understands. He's too self-absorbed and self-focused to understand all of the criminal plots going on around him. When he scolds characters such as Mr. and Mrs. Iverson, it seems like sanctimony and frustration, not righteous indignation. I always feel like everybody in the movie is using him. They're all in on some kind of plot and they're always laughing at him behind his back--or so it seems or so Hackman feels.Therein lies this movie's problem for me. I feel like Penn and his screenwriter Alan Sharp are at times withholding information from the audience in the same way characters in the movie withhold it from Hackman. Later conspiracy thrillers such as Blow Out and Cutter's Way created a web of mystery and loose ends without leaving the audience completely out in the cold the way Night Moves does.But I watch and enjoy this movie a lot.

233009,A1U360OMVQRPUB,630026887X,Mel Odom,"[1, 1]","I'm a big fan of private eye movies and television series.  I'm glad THE ROCKFORD FILES has finally come out on DVD, but I'm still waiting for MARLOWE, starring James Garner and Bruce Lee.However, I don't have an excuse for not having already seen Night Moves.  It's been out for over thirty years, and I bought the DVD a year ago.  I did finally get around to watching it, though, and it was as good as I'd hoped it would be.The story is pure 1970s, as evidenced by the cars, clothing, and some of the language.  But it also tells a timeless story of confusion and betrayal, and the layers of secrets that add to those.Gene Hackman stars as Harry Moseby, an ex-football player rather than an ex-cop.  Moseby has been broken down by family problems and the loss of his career, and seems to be barely hanging onto life by a thread.  Only the occasional missing persons case appears to keep him financially afloat and emotionally anchored.Hackman has always been a personal favorite of mine.  He can pull off any kind of role and look good doing it, even if the film is total cheese.  He's just a guy I look at and immediately respect.  His everyman stance and his charm just oozes from every pore.  As Moseby, he was a well-known football hero, and a lot of his friends still see him as a standup guy, but he doesn't let anyone in too close.Unfortunately, that same inability for closeness is what ultimately undermines his relationship with his wife, Ellen (Susan Clark).  When he first gets handed the case of the little runaway rich girl, Moseby isn't too interested.  Then he catches his wife cheating on him and tries to lose himself in the investigation.I liked the way the movie dovetailed back into the movie industry the way some of the old 1940s movies did.  Some of the best cinematic detectives have their roots in the twisted and sordid tales that came out of Hollywood.  This one has stuntmen and used up actors to season the tale, and it adds more credibility to it.The Florida footage on the case was extremely well done as well.  Director Arthur Penn (LITTLE BIG MAN, BONNIE AND CLYDE) manages the Hollywood and LA scenes well, then zips the viewer down for a peak at what was then Travis McGee's tramping grounds as John D. MacDonald wrote his adventures.  I liked the rough and tumble atmosphere of the land, the characters, and the twists and turns the plot took while down there.  Jennifer Warren plays femme fatale Paula in a haunting and sexy scene.Some of the most fun was watching a very young James Woods and Melanie Griffith taking their places on the stage.  Woods hasn't changed much, but his presence on the screen is intense these days.  He's another one of my favorites.

That is the mindset you need for this film.Roger Ebert, whom I adore, gives film recommendations. 'Night Moves' sounded like a film I would like, old noir, great cast, Gene Hackman, Susan Clark, a very young James Wood, Melanie Griffin's first film, and Jennifer Warren. Hackman is a private eye. The old school, his name is Harry Moseby and his firm is called ' Moseby Confidential'. He runs one of those shops where he is usually looking for a job, and we can tell from his stance and his interest that he loves his job. He is interested in people, not just solving their mysteries. He is called by a woman, a B Movie actress, who built her career on her body. She is minus two husbands and now has lost her 16 year old daughter. Moseby is invited to take the job and the mother, if he wishes, he takes the job. Off he goes on his hunt, to an old film set and then to Florida. Before he leaves, he finds his wife is not as loving as he thought, and this trip could be the distance they need. One clue and one conversation after another take place and eventually he is led to the step father of the missing girl in Florida. After a time and some curious events, he takes the girl home and thinks all is done, and he collects his money. The mystery has really just begun, and Moseby finds himself in hot water and wondering what is going on. I found myself in the same boat. However, I had some doubts about some of the characters, and my intuition was correct. However, I had no idea how far off the track I was, and how far off the track Moseby was. An interesting trip that is more than circuitous. The plot line left me near the beginning of the film.As you watch this film, you might find yourself asking more questions than there are answers. I really don't know why the film ended as it did, and though I liked the cast and characters, I can't say the film thrilled me. It had lots of action, but I could not find anything that tied this film together.

I like a good detective movie and I was looking forward to seeing it which I did last night.  I was disappointed in the movie.  In all fairness, my disappointment was borne in high expectations.  However, I found the plot unnecessarily complicated (many will probably like this aspect).  The characters were too much.  Our hero, for example, is a former All-Pro football player.  Except for some access issues that could have easily been re-scripted to create the same scenarios, there was no need to create such an esoteric facet.  We are treated to analysis of the private detective's incomplete relationship with his father which also took us aimlessly down a dead end.  I could go on and on but the ending really caught me off guard.  It wasn't until today I realized how impressive the conclusion was.  The closing scene is of a small boat at sea.  A person struggles to get the engine started.  With great difficulty, this person is finally able to get the motor up to speed but was unable to steer the boat or see in what direction it was headed.

Who would have thought at the time how well they would be paired up in the future in &quot;Another Day in Paradise.&quot;",3,JUST OK,1005436800,"11 11, 2001",2001,455,"['much', 'praised', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'just', 'average', 'noir', 'private', 'eye', 'film', 'tape', 'had', 'showed', 'photography', 'be', 'lacking', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'dimly', 'lit', 'could', 'barely', 'discern', 'action', 'believe', 'Arthur', 'Penn', 'direction', 'lacking', 'too.It', 'chance', 'see', 'young', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'James', 'Woods', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'time', 'how', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'paired', 'up', 'future', 'quot', 'Day', 'Paradise.', 'quot']",N/A

Harry's wife (Susan Clark)feels ignored by her husband and resents his frequent absences and pursues an affair with another man complicating his placid existence. His pursuit of the girl opens up a pandora's box of murder, deceit and greed that he's completely unprepared for. Written by Alan Sharp, ""Night Moves"" incorporates elements from the novel ""The Stunt Man"" which director Arthur Penn was originally supposed to direct (he had to pull out to a prior commitment at the last minute)and features a number of marvelous suspenseful set pieces.Well directed by Penn (""Little Big Man"", ""Bonnie & Clyde""), ""Night Moves"" is the same rancid world that Gittes faced in ""Chinatown"" only the players have changed but not the greed that drives those that commit the crimes. Hackman delivers one of his finest performances. Susan Clark and the rest of the supporting cast all turn in terrific performances adding to the gritty realism of the film.I've seen a couple of complaints about how dark the video was for this film. Rest assured, ""Night Moves"" looks terrific. Warner has struck a brand new print of the film and given it the deluxe treatment. Colors are vibrant and bright throughout the film. There's no noticeable dirt or debris to mar the picture and only an occasional analog flaw that was on the original negative of the film. The film features the original vintage featurette produced to promote the film focusing on the moive ""Night Moves"" and director Arthur Penn's approach to film directing as well as the original theatrical trailer for the film.",5,Sly mystery isn't what it seems,1121385600,"07 15, 2005",2005,1952,"['Chinatown', 'only', 'contemporary', 'mystery', 'can', 'compare', 'Night', 'Moves', 'much', 'more', 'going', 'placid', 'chilly', 'surface', 'water', 'conclusion', 'film', 'eye.Ex-football', 'player', 'private', 'eye', 'Harry', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'hired', 'find', 'worldly', 'daughter', 'Melaine', 'Griffith', 'second', 'screen', 'role', 'tender', 'age', '18', 'Hollywood', 'socialite', 'Harry', 'wife', 'Susan', 'Clark', 'feels', 'ignored', 'husband', 'resents', 'frequent', 'absences', 'pursues', 'affair', 'man', 'complicating', 'placid', 'existence', 'pursuit', 'girl', 'up', 'pandora', 'box', 'murder', 'deceit', 'greed', 'completely', 'unprepared', 'Written', 'Alan', 'Sharp', 'Night', 'Moves', 'elements', 'novel', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'director', 'Arthur', 'Penn', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'direct', 'had', 'pull', 'out', 'prior', 'commitment', 'last', 'minute', 'number', 'marvelous', 'suspenseful', 'set', 'pieces.Well', 'directed', 'Penn', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Night', 'Moves', 'same', 'rancid', 'world', 'faced', 'Chinatown', 'only', 'players', 'have', 'changed', 'not', 'greed', 'commit', 'crimes', 'Hackman', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'Susan', 'Clark', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'turn', 'terrific', 'performances', 'adding', 'gritty', 'realism', 'film.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'couple', 'complaints', 'how', 'dark', 'video', 'was', 'film', 'Rest', 'assured', 'Night', 'Moves', 'terrific', 'Warner', 'struck', 'brand', 'new', 'print', 'film', 'given', 'deluxe', 'treatment', 'Colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'bright', 'film', 'noticeable', 'dirt', 'debris', 'mar', 'picture', 'only', 'occasional', 'analog', 'flaw', 'was', 'original', 'negative', 'film', 'film', 'original', 'vintage', 'featurette', 'produced', 'promote', 'film', 'focusing', 'moive', 'Night', 'Moves', 'director', 'Arthur', 'Penn', 'approach', 'film', 'directing', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'film']",N/A
