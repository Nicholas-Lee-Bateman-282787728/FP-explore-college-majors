854893,A22R7DOWO8O9V9,B00049QJSO,C. Hrozencik,"[0, 4]","First of all this isn't a bad movie but it just could have been a lot better. The movie is about Goku J.R the granson of Pan who is a adult now. Pan wants Goku J.R to get stronger and stand up to pepole. However Goku J.R isn't really strong and gets picked on by bullys and gets his stuff stolen. After Pan hears about it she is outraged and tells him to beacome stronger but then she has heart failer and has great chances of diying. Goku J.R decides to save his grandma and goes to find the Dragon Balls to save pan. On the road Goku J.R meets the bully who picked on him after being tricked by a truck driver they seet of to help eachother a meet a lady who lets them stay at her house. But, this lady was really a monster who attacks them but Goku J.R and his friend escape. After being scared to help his friend at a bridge his friend falls after the bridge beacomes lose and dies. Goku J.R is sad but it will take me to long to tell the rest of the movie but the movie dosn't have enough action and a little more bit of drama. This is great if you like drama anmie but if you like action you might want to check out the Dragon Ball GT series. A ok movie but they should make a sequal.",3,Make a sequal,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,1190,"['First', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'movie', 'Goku', 'J.R', 'granson', 'Pan', 'who', 'adult', 'now', 'Pan', 'Goku', 'J.R', 'get', 'stronger', 'stand', 'up', 'pepole', 'However', 'Goku', 'J.R', ""n't"", 'really', 'strong', 'picked', 'bullys', 'stuff', 'stolen', 'Pan', 'outraged', 'beacome', 'stronger', 'then', 'heart', 'failer', 'great', 'chances', 'diying', 'Goku', 'J.R', 'save', 'grandma', 'find', 'Dragon', 'Balls', 'save', 'pan', 'road', 'Goku', 'J.R', 'bully', 'who', 'picked', 'being', 'tricked', 'truck', 'driver', 'seet', 'help', 'eachother', 'meet', 'lady', 'who', 'stay', 'house', 'lady', 'was', 'really', 'monster', 'who', 'Goku', 'J.R', 'friend', 'escape', 'being', 'scared', 'help', 'friend', 'bridge', 'friend', 'bridge', 'beacomes', 'lose', 'dies', 'Goku', 'J.R', 'sad', 'will', 'take', 'long', 'tell', 'rest', 'movie', 'movie', 'dos', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'action', 'little', 'more', 'bit', 'drama', 'great', 'like', 'drama', 'anmie', 'like', 'action', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'GT', 'series', 'ok', 'movie', 'should', 'make', 'sequal']",Dragon Ball Gt: Hero's Legacy VHS

It also proved a good point, with a little help from your friends you can make it. The way Chibi Gokou reacts when Pan gets sick is amazing and the way it makes you feel, it's like your in the Anime. And when  Gokou has to go on the journey to find the dragonball to bring back Pan, it is just an amazing story. I'm not goin to sit here and blah blah my mouth off, go check it out.

He's absolutely adorable, even when there are tears and snot running down his face, and pee running down his leg.  He finds out at the end that he does have courage when he needs it, and proves that the power of the Super Saijin will never die.",5,Finally in America!,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,612,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Japanese', 'version', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'be', 'dubbed', 'english.100', 'years', 'Goku', 'Earth', 'Great', 'Great', 'well', 'get', 'Grandson', 'Goku', 'Jr.', 'set', 'out', 'quest', 'find', '4-star', 'dragonball', 'will', 'help', 'sick', 'Grandma.Even', 'Goku', 'Jr.', 'complete', 'coward', 'have', 'fall', 'love', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'tears', 'snot', 'running', 'down', 'face', 'pee', 'running', 'down', 'leg', 'out', 'end', 'have', 'courage', 'when', 'power', 'Super', 'Saijin', 'will', 'never', 'die']",Dragon Ball Gt: Hero's Legacy VHS
854896,A38AXXL7DMVFMQ,B00049QJSO,"Vicente Drago ""Shaun O'Donnell""","[27, 27]","This is an intersting piece of work in that it is a Dragon Ball Movie but the story takes place decades after GT ends.  It is also light on action and more in tune with some comedy and story telling.The story here is that it has been nearly a century since GT ended and Goku went to train with Shenron.  Pan is now an old woman who is raising her grandchild Goku jr.  Goku bears an uncanny resemblance to his ancestor but lacks his courage (much like a young Gohan).  Goku gets bullied at school and does not stand up for himself.  One day while Pan is lecturing Goku on how he should stand up to those bullies she suffers a heart attack.  Goku fearing the worst decides to journy to Mount Pao to find the Dragon Balls and wish Pan healthy again. Along the way he faces off against some evil demons, gains some friends, and even brings out his hidden powers (aka Super Sayin).  In the end all ends happily as he meets his Ancestor Goku and learns of what real courage is and what his future could hold.This is a simple movie that like I said is light on action and is more about telling a good story.  Goku is a lovable character and the villians, although weak compared to what his ancestor faced off against numerouse times prove menacing enough that they are decent foes.  Overall this is one of the better Dragon Ball movies and comes recomended.  However if you watch them for the action then you may want to avoid this one.",4,The Heros Legacy,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,1429,"['intersting', 'piece', 'work', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Movie', 'story', 'place', 'decades', 'GT', 'also', 'light', 'action', 'more', 'tune', 'comedy', 'story', 'telling.The', 'story', 'here', 'been', 'nearly', 'century', 'GT', 'ended', 'Goku', 'went', 'train', 'Shenron', 'Pan', 'now', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'raising', 'grandchild', 'Goku', 'jr.', 'Goku', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'ancestor', 'courage', 'much', 'young', 'Gohan', 'Goku', 'bullied', 'school', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'One', 'day', 'Pan', 'lecturing', 'Goku', 'how', 'should', 'stand', 'up', 'bullies', 'heart', 'attack', 'Goku', 'fearing', 'worst', 'decides', 'journy', 'Mount', 'Pao', 'find', 'Dragon', 'Balls', 'wish', 'Pan', 'healthy', 'again', 'way', 'off', 'evil', 'demons', 'gains', 'friends', 'even', 'out', 'hidden', 'powers', 'aka', 'Super', 'Sayin', 'end', 'happily', 'Ancestor', 'Goku', 'learns', 'what', 'real', 'courage', 'what', 'future', 'could', 'hold.This', 'simple', 'movie', 'said', 'light', 'action', 'more', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'Goku', 'lovable', 'character', 'villians', 'weak', 'compared', 'what', 'ancestor', 'faced', 'off', 'numerouse', 'times', 'prove', 'menacing', 'enough', 'are', 'decent', 'foes', 'Overall', 'one', 'better', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'movies', 'recomended', 'However', 'watch', 'action', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'avoid', 'one']",Dragon Ball Gt: Hero's Legacy VHS
