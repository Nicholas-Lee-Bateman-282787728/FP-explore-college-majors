1334099,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0039UT3LK,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","This one is easy. See it. Why? Well, if for no other reason that Jeff Bridges finally won an Academy Award for his lead role as Bad Blake in it, a role that he has been waiting for about forty years to cash in on. Every since I first saw Bridges as Duane in the screen version of Larry MacMurtry's great novel of the New West, ""The Last Picture Show"", I have known that he had the righteous, good-hearted, hard-drinking, devil-take-the-hinter post, sexually energetic and troubled ""old geezer"" that he personifies in the Blake role in him. He has done other fine performances but there is something just a little extra that he brings to that good-ole-boy role, young or old.And here is the kicker. As most of those in America who have being paying attention in the lead-up to the Oscars know this film is about an alcoholic, back roads traveling, down on his luck, hard living country singer, an ""outlaw"" singer for sure. But also a man in desperate need of either a good woman or a good twelve step program, or both. That premise drives the action and the music. The Blake character could be based on about twelve guys from the 1970s  with that fistful of ""outlaw cred"" from Waylon Jennings to Townes Van Zandt (whose ""If I Needed  You"" is part of the soundtrack here). And that is my final point. Back in those days I had what I call my ""country moment"". I gravitated toward the ""outlaw country"" sound, especially that of Townes Van Zandt, from my permanent berth deep in the blues, city and country, and to a lesser extent, folk. The Jeff Bridges/Bad Blake character is just the cinematic expression of that moment for me.

There was a selection of vampire movies, big Hollywood action movies, animated movies including Jeff Bridges in Tron but I really wanted to find a movie that told a good story.  And Crazy Heart delivered the goods... and some.  The story is about Bad Blake, a talented down and out western singer/songwriter who spends most of his time drinking himself into a stupor instead of working on his songs. But when he is on the stage, Bad Blake is entertaining. I was impressed with Bridge's performance. Not only did he portray Bad Blake with a raw honesty, his singing was fabulous. Although the storyline is not a new one, it is really Jeff Bridge's performance that brings his character to life. I genuinely felt for Bad Blake even though the problems in his life were all due to his own bad choices in life.

I just want to write about the things that I loved about this film.The music of the film is fantastic and the actors themselves have sung it, which is amazing.The landscape of the movie complements the mood of the movie which has been shot in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Texas. The outdoor photography is simply marvelous.The actors are all simply superb. Collin Farell was in my opinion the weakest link because he looks and acted all wooden but he is overshadowed by the strength of the movie so this did not make such a difference. Maggie Gyllenhal was a revelation as a single mom, trying to succeed and doing the right thing for her child. Robert Duvall, who has produced this movie is superb in a very brief role. Rising above the rest of the cast is Jeff Bridges, who is superb as the alcoholic who attempts the rocky road to recovery. He conveys self pity with such a pride.Crazy heart is a great film, with a screenplay that has been attempted before in a different form but the treatment of this tired story by the director Scott Copper is such that it may well become one of your favorite movies this year. 4 stars. 11/22/10",4,Take a chance on this heart,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,1232,"['will', 'not', 'take', 'up', 'space', 'writing', 'description', 'movie', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'just', 'want', 'write', 'things', 'loved', 'film.The', 'music', 'film', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'have', 'sung', 'amazing.The', 'landscape', 'movie', 'mood', 'movie', 'been', 'shot', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Texas', 'outdoor', 'photography', 'simply', 'marvelous.The', 'actors', 'are', 'simply', 'superb', 'Collin', 'Farell', 'was', 'opinion', 'weakest', 'link', 'acted', 'wooden', 'overshadowed', 'strength', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'such', 'difference', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhal', 'was', 'revelation', 'single', 'mom', 'trying', 'succeed', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'child', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'produced', 'movie', 'superb', 'very', 'brief', 'role', 'Rising', 'rest', 'cast', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'who', 'superb', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'rocky', 'road', 'recovery', 'conveys', 'pity', 'pride.Crazy', 'heart', 'great', 'film', 'screenplay', 'been', 'attempted', 'different', 'form', 'treatment', 'tired', 'story', 'director', 'Scott', 'Copper', 'such', 'may', 'well', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'year', '4', 'stars', '11/22/10']",Crazy Heart
1334104,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0039UT3LK,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I want it to be clear to the world that Jeff Bridges is one of the best actors of his generation (or any generation for that matter) and so his Oscar win last year was a joyous as Kate Winslet's the year before.  Finally, the man who gave us such diverse and effortless performances year after year has the golden bad boy that has eluded him all along.  For me, this is not his finest performance (seriously, watch `The Door in the Floor', like NOW) and I personally don't think he was the best of `09's nominees (Firth and Renner were outstandingly superb) but in my eyes NO ONE ELSE was going to take that Oscar, and I'm glad they didn't.But, this review is not about the Oscars, it is about `Crazy Heart'; the film.For me, the film as a whole is rather generic.  There isn't anything here that we haven't seen before, and at that the story itself feels a tad recycled.  Still, the overall impact of the film, while subtle and restrained, is enjoyable and memorable thanks to powerful performances by the two key stars.The film follows a washed up alcoholic country star (yes, `Tender Mercies' called; they want their plot back) who gets a second chance at life (and fame) when the culminations of a newfound relationship with a young reporter and a rekindled relationship with a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; begin to play out in his favor.  Bad Blake is old and unhealthy and unhappy.  He's lonely.  He's desperate to regain a fraction of his former popularity mainly because he's broke.  He's so desperate that he's willing to open for Tommy Sweet, a young heartthrob who got his start thanks to Bad.  In the process of rediscovering his self worth, Bad meets Jean, a beautiful divorcee with a 4-year old son.  Jean is a novice reporter who finds herself falling in love with Bad.Of course, things can't go great forever.I found aspects of this story hard to wrap my head around (the relationship between Bad and Jean is very underdeveloped and unbelievable in many respects) even if the performances sustained our disbelief long enough to get us to go along with the proceedings.  I felt that the conclusion was justified and appropriate, but getting there felt slightly underwhelming and a tad `too conventional'.I agree with some friends who claim that this film feels kind of like a Lifetime movie.That said, I applaud Gyllenhaal and Bridges for investing heart and soul here.  I'm happy for Gyllenhaal (it's about time she got an Oscar nomination) even if the lack of depth provided by the script proves to be a drawback for her.  With all my qualms about the quality of the film, there is no doubt that Bridges delivered a quality performance.  Even though it wasn't his best, it was not a win to feel ashamed about.  He is such an effortless actor, finding the depths of emotional complexity and delivering with without batting an eyelash.  The scene at the `slammed in face' door is enough to validate that Oscar.  The heartbreak on his face just swallows you.""But I love you guys.""Anyways, I totally recommend seeing this film.  It doesn't `go there' like it could have, especially considering the subject matter.  The script almost feels skeletal, but the performances are far from that.Oh, and Jeff Bridges can REALLY sing!",3,Oscar winner Jeff Bridges!,1290988800,"11 29, 2010",2010,3238,"['want', 'be', 'clear', 'world', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'generation', 'generation', 'matter', 'so', 'Oscar', 'win', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'joyous', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'year', 'before', 'Finally', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'such', 'diverse', 'effortless', 'performances', 'year', 'year', 'golden', 'bad', 'boy', 'eluded', 'along', 'not', 'finest', 'performance', 'seriously', 'watch', 'Door', 'Floor', 'NOW', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'best', '09', 'nominees', 'Firth', 'Renner', 'were', 'outstandingly', 'superb', 'eyes', 'ONE', 'ELSE', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'Oscar', ""'m"", 'glad', ""didn't.But"", 'review', 'not', 'Oscars', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'film.For', 'film', 'whole', 'rather', 'generic', ""n't"", 'anything', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'story', 'tad', 'recycled', 'Still', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'subtle', 'restrained', 'enjoyable', 'memorable', 'thanks', 'powerful', 'performances', 'two', 'key', 'stars.The', 'film', 'washed', 'up', 'alcoholic', 'country', 'star', 'yes', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'called', 'want', 'plot', 'back', 'who', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'fame', 'when', 'culminations', 'newfound', 'relationship', 'young', 'reporter', 'rekindled', 'relationship', 'former', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'begin', 'play', 'out', 'favor', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'old', 'unhealthy', 'unhappy', 'lonely', 'desperate', 'regain', 'fraction', 'former', 'popularity', 'mainly', 'broke', 'so', 'desperate', 'willing', 'open', 'Tommy', 'Sweet', 'young', 'heartthrob', 'who', 'got', 'start', 'thanks', 'Bad', 'process', 'rediscovering', 'self', 'worth', 'Bad', 'Jean', 'beautiful', 'divorcee', '4-year', 'old', 'son', 'Jean', 'novice', 'reporter', 'who', 'falling', 'love', 'Bad.Of', 'course', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'great', 'forever.I', 'found', 'aspects', 'story', 'hard', 'wrap', 'head', 'relationship', 'Bad', 'Jean', 'very', 'underdeveloped', 'unbelievable', 'many', 'respects', 'even', 'performances', 'sustained', 'disbelief', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'go', 'along', 'proceedings', 'felt', 'conclusion', 'was', 'justified', 'appropriate', 'getting', 'there', 'felt', 'slightly', 'underwhelming', 'tad', 'too', ""conventional'.I"", 'agree', 'friends', 'who', 'claim', 'film', 'kind', 'Lifetime', 'said', 'applaud', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Bridges', 'investing', 'heart', 'soul', 'here', ""'m"", 'happy', 'Gyllenhaal', 'time', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'even', 'lack', 'depth', 'provided', 'script', 'be', 'drawback', 'qualms', 'quality', 'film', 'doubt', 'Bridges', 'delivered', 'quality', 'performance', 'Even', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'was', 'not', 'win', 'feel', 'ashamed', 'such', 'effortless', 'actor', 'finding', 'depths', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'delivering', 'batting', 'eyelash', 'scene', 'slammed', 'face', 'door', 'enough', 'validate', 'Oscar', 'heartbreak', 'face', 'just', 'love', 'guys', 'Anyways', 'totally', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'especially', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'script', 'almost', 'feels', 'skeletal', 'performances', 'are', 'far', 'that.Oh', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'can', 'REALLY', 'sing']",Crazy Heart

I just wish the story would have gone a little further--it just seemed to end too soon. He never is able to melt the ice with his son, and his relationship with his girlfriend is never fully resolved either. Also, it would have been nice to see some musical interplay with Tommy Sweet, maybe even a flashback to show how Sweet honed his reputation as Blake's sideman before breaking out on his own. The movie simply seems to pick up (and end) in the middle of the story, for me. Colin Farrell does a fine job of acting, but too bad Brad Paisley is no actor (that I'm aware of, anyway)...if he had played the part of Tommy Sweet (he would be perfect for it if he could act), then we could have been treated to some ripping guitar playing with scenes of him and Bad Blake jamming together!And obviously, the story is in some ways quite reminiscient of the movie Tender Mercies, for which Robert Duvall earned an Oscar. I don't think it's just coincidence that Duvall makes an appearance in this flick as well--kind of a nod to him for setting the stage for Crazy Heart, maybe? :-) Perhaps a nice way of putting this would be to say that this flick is kind of a ""tribute"" film to Tender Mercies, rather than saying it's an unoriginal story of a down-on-his-luck, has-been country singer meeting a woman who helps turn his life around.So I wouldn't say five stars, it just could have been better in several ways, IMO.",4,"Great acting, but the story could have dug a little deeper...",1272412800,"04 28, 2010",2010,1555,"['movie', 'was', 'great', 'vehicle', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'display', 'versatility', 'actor', 'musician/singer', 'question', 'Fine', 'performance', 'just', 'wish', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'little', 'further', 'just', 'seemed', 'end', 'too', 'soon', 'never', 'able', 'melt', 'ice', 'son', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'never', 'fully', 'resolved', 'either', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'musical', 'interplay', 'Tommy', 'Sweet', 'maybe', 'even', 'flashback', 'show', 'how', 'Sweet', 'honed', 'reputation', 'Blake', 'sideman', 'breaking', 'out', 'own', 'movie', 'simply', 'pick', 'up', 'end', 'middle', 'story', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'fine', 'job', 'acting', 'too', 'bad', 'Brad', 'Paisley', 'actor', ""'m"", 'aware', 'anyway', 'had', 'played', 'part', 'Tommy', 'Sweet', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'could', 'act', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'ripping', 'guitar', 'playing', 'scenes', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'jamming', 'together', 'obviously', 'story', 'ways', 'quite', 'reminiscient', 'movie', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'coincidence', 'Duvall', 'appearance', 'flick', 'as', 'well', 'kind', 'nod', 'setting', 'stage', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'maybe', 'Perhaps', 'nice', 'way', 'putting', 'would', 'be', 'say', 'flick', 'kind', 'tribute', 'film', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'rather', 'saying', 'unoriginal', 'story', 'down-on-his-luck', 'has-been', 'country', 'singer', 'meeting', 'woman', 'who', 'turn', 'life', 'around.So', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'five', 'stars', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'several', 'ways', 'IMO']",Crazy Heart

It could be talking about Bad Blake, a country singer at the weary end of his career who is getting overshadowed by the newer country singers and is relegated to playing bowling alleys and dive bars. It could also be pointing to Hollywood which is not very kind to aging actors. Actors definitely have more longevity than actresses but it stil ain't easy.Both Blake and Bridges are similar in that they are both aging, charming and incredibly talented but they have never really gotten the recognition they deserve. Maybe that is what allows him to pay this role with such authenticity. Mr Bridges is one of the actors who tends to improve any movie he is in.In what is one of his best peformances to date, Mr Bridges portrays the ethos of real country music - not the stuff of today but more the kind done by Hank Williams, Willie Nelson. The heartache, the self destruction, the redemption are well known themes of country music and so is for Bad Blake.It is a movie of modest ambitions. It doesn't seek to go beyond its characters but the performances elevate it to something beyond the drivel studios churn out these days.

The photography was absolutely brilliant throughout the film, along with the production design, writing, acting and music.  Jeff earned his Oscar with this performance.  I was so enthralled with the visual shots that I looked up the Director of Photography (DP) for the film on imdb.com while I was watching.  I just had to know who was behind this visual smorgasbord of cool shots and great lighting.  Turns out it was Cinematographer Barry Markowitz.  I've only seen one of his previous films that he has shot:  All The Pretty Horses (2000) with Matt Damon, which I can't say was memorable.  But I was very impressed with Markowitz's eye on this film.As far as the story, I was continually interested in the unraveling of Bad Blake's persona, his past, and his relationships.  I wonder more and more why it seems that great musicians, artists, and other creative people often have drug and alcohol problems.  It seems to be a common theme I've seen in much of the great art and music I love.  Is it the artist's success, or lack of success, that drives them to drink or take drugs?  Is it the work, i.e. the creations that they are bringing forth that cause them to turn to substances?  Or is it their psychology and life experiences, good and bad?  One has to ask the question I think of whether being creative causes substance abuse or whether substance abuse causes being creative?  When I look at great music from Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix and so many other musicians that was created while they were on something, I wonder if we would have that great music if they hadn't been high or drunk.  I'm not going to pretend that I have the answers to these questions, but part of watching Crazy Heart for me was re-visiting these questions for myself and simply appreciating artists for who they are, flaws and all.What I love about a movie like Crazy Heart is that it feeds my soul and my passion for wanting to tell stories through film.  It's filled with interesting characters, stories and details that makes life rich and worthy of sharing.  They aren't all nice and neat details, but some of them are flawed and f**ked up.  But that's what life is.  It doesn't all fit into a perfect package.  Sometimes the greatest gifts come with the greatest flaws.",4,Perfect Package,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,2855,"['finally', 'watched', 'Crazy', 'Heart', '2009', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', '2', 'weeks', 'ago', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'heard', 'last', 'Fall', 'kept', 'trying', 'rent', 'Redbox', 'was', 'always', 'checked', 'out', 'when', 'searched', 'first', 'few', 'weeks', 'DVD', 'release', 'Obviously', 'was', ""n't"", 'alone', 'desire', 'see', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'lonely', 'emotionally', 'broken', 'country', 'singer', 'named', 'Bad', 'Blake.Immediately', 'opening', 'visual', 'shot', 'film', 'had', 'sense', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'movie', 'photography', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'film', 'production', 'design', 'writing', 'acting', 'music', 'Jeff', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'enthralled', 'visual', 'shots', 'looked', 'up', 'Director', 'Photography', 'DP', 'film', 'imdb.com', 'was', 'watching', 'just', 'had', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'visual', 'smorgasbord', 'cool', 'shots', 'great', 'lighting', 'out', 'was', 'Cinematographer', 'Barry', 'Markowitz', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'one', 'previous', 'films', 'shot', 'Pretty', 'Horses', '2000', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'memorable', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Markowitz', 'eye', 'film.As', 'far', 'story', 'was', 'continually', 'interested', 'unraveling', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'persona', 'past', 'relationships', 'wonder', 'more', 'more', 'why', 'great', 'musicians', 'artists', 'other', 'creative', 'people', 'often', 'have', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'problems', 'be', 'common', 'theme', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'much', 'great', 'art', 'music', 'love', 'artist', 'success', 'lack', 'success', 'drink', 'take', 'drugs', 'work', 'i.e', 'creations', 'are', 'bringing', 'forth', 'cause', 'turn', 'substances', 'psychology', 'life', 'experiences', 'good', 'bad', 'One', 'ask', 'question', 'think', 'being', 'creative', 'causes', 'substance', 'abuse', 'substance', 'abuse', 'being', 'creative', 'When', 'look', 'great', 'music', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Nirvana', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'musicians', 'was', 'created', 'were', 'something', 'wonder', 'would', 'have', 'great', 'music', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'high', 'drunk', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'pretend', 'have', 'answers', 'questions', 'part', 'watching', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'was', 're-visiting', 'questions', 'simply', 'appreciating', 'artists', 'who', 'are', 'flaws', 'love', 'movie', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'soul', 'passion', 'wanting', 'tell', 'stories', 'film', 'filled', 'interesting', 'characters', 'stories', 'details', 'life', 'rich', 'worthy', 'sharing', 'are', ""n't"", 'nice', 'neat', 'details', 'are', 'flawed', 'f**ked', 'up', 'what', 'life', ""n't"", 'all', 'fit', 'perfect', 'package', 'greatest', 'gifts', 'come', 'greatest', 'flaws']",Crazy Heart
1334112,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B0039UT3LK,B. Martin,"[2, 2]","Jeff Bridges gives the perfromance of his career (ranking slightly above his legendary comedic role in The Big Lebowski) as Bad Blake, a washed up country star who finds redemption with the help of a young single mother (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and her four year old son.  It's a simple story that we've heard before, but it works thanks to the excellent performaces by both Bridges and Gyllenhaal, who make their characters feel painfully real in terms of the choices they make and the baggage they carry.Bad Blake is a former country legend who has lost a great deal in his life due to his alcoholism and now finds himself playing gigs at bowling alleys and bars just to make ends meet.  All the while he seems to blame others for his own downfall, particularly a young star who started out as a backing member in his former band (Colin Farrell) who he believes shoved him out of the limelight after studying at his feet for years.  We quickly learn that Blake's perception of things don't necessarily line up with reality.  As the movie progresses it becomes painfully clear that Blake is in the position he is because of his own stubborness and refusal to make changes in his life.The catalyst for those changes comes when he meets a young reporter (Gyllenhaal) and her son and falls for her.  The path that their relationship takes is inevitiable, but necessary since it eventually forces Blake to straighten his life out lest he suffer more losses at his own hands.  Again, this is a familiar story but it works since the movie is very low-key and melodrama free.  Things move at such a leisurely pace, in fact, that it's a shock when the movie delivers an emotional wallop at the end.Of course, a lot of the credit must go to Bridges.  He fully inhabits this character, making Blake a deeply flawed human being who we can't help but root for, even though he has destroyed his life largely by his own actions.  Couple that with some incredible music (which Bridges sings and plays quite impressively) and you have a tough little movie about life, love, loss and the ability to fight through it all and emerge the stronger for it.",4,Falling feels like flying,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,2130,"['Jeff', 'Bridges', 'perfromance', 'career', 'ranking', 'slightly', 'legendary', 'comedic', 'role', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'washed', 'up', 'country', 'star', 'who', 'redemption', 'help', 'young', 'single', 'mother', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'simple', 'story', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'thanks', 'excellent', 'performaces', 'Bridges', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'make', 'characters', 'feel', 'painfully', 'real', 'terms', 'choices', 'make', 'baggage', 'carry.Bad', 'Blake', 'former', 'country', 'legend', 'who', 'lost', 'great', 'deal', 'life', 'due', 'alcoholism', 'now', 'playing', 'gigs', 'bowling', 'alleys', 'bars', 'just', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'while', 'blame', 'others', 'own', 'downfall', 'particularly', 'young', 'star', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'backing', 'member', 'former', 'band', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'shoved', 'limelight', 'studying', 'feet', 'years', 'quickly', 'learn', 'Blake', 'perception', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'line', 'up', 'reality', 'movie', 'painfully', 'clear', 'Blake', 'position', 'own', 'stubborness', 'refusal', 'make', 'changes', 'life.The', 'catalyst', 'changes', 'when', 'young', 'reporter', 'Gyllenhaal', 'son', 'path', 'relationship', 'inevitiable', 'necessary', 'eventually', 'Blake', 'straighten', 'life', 'out', 'suffer', 'more', 'losses', 'own', 'hands', 'Again', 'familiar', 'story', 'movie', 'very', 'low-key', 'melodrama', 'free', 'Things', 'move', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'fact', 'shock', 'when', 'movie', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'end.Of', 'course', 'lot', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'Bridges', 'fully', 'character', 'making', 'Blake', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'even', 'destroyed', 'life', 'largely', 'own', 'actions', 'Couple', 'incredible', 'music', 'Bridges', 'sings', 'quite', 'impressively', 'have', 'tough', 'little', 'movie', 'life', 'love', 'loss', 'ability', 'fight', 'emerge', 'stronger']",Crazy Heart

1334119,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B0039UT3LK,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 1]","Jeff Bridges is a very musical guy, for an actor. Maybe those bridges he's named for are like the bridges in songs: verse, chorus, bridge. In The Fabulous Baker Boys Jeff Bridges played a jazz pianist and he was fabsolutely abulous. He learned piano well enough to play the tunes, though the actual music was dubbed in by Dave Grusin. As cool and hep as he looked as a jazz cat, in Crazy Heart, he had the perfect look for a country singer. Looks like Kris Kristopherson, sounds even better. Both have co-starred with Barbara Striesand. Maybe The Other Side of the Mirror and the third remake of A Star is Born is an unfair comparison, but Jeff Bridges, most would agree, is a better actor than Kris. Kris Kristopherson was a country singer and he wrote Sunday Morning Coming Down for Johnny Cash, and Me and Bobby McGee was a big hit for Janis--but as authentic as he would have been as Bad Blake, once you've seen Crazy Heart you know that no one could've done it better than Jeff Bridges.The Dude AbidesIt's time for an Oscar for Bridges. You know that if he wins, there will be a huge standing ovation. No one else could be more certain to get a huge standing ovation if, or should I say when, he wins (I actually wrote this review before the Oscars, but I waited until the DVD was released to post it. OF COURSE the dude won the Oscar as predicted). He is long overdue for an Oscar.Bad Blake is a total mess, but music means a lot to him, and his music means a lot to many others: Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal), one of the pick up bands, his buddy Wayne (Robert Duvall), many of the fans, Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrel)--but don't mention Tommy Sweet.Bad doesn't like it when people ask him about Tommy, because Tommy is at his peak while Blake is a has-been(I mean, 'a living legend'). Tommy helps him out though, and turns his fortunes around. Colin Farrel was very sweet as Tommy Sweet. He also sang pretty good. Didn't steal the show, but was believable as a Country Music star.Robert Duvall was his friend Wayne, a bar owner, who gave him a ration of booze but could also see that when it was time for him to quit drinking, it was time for him to quit drinking. His support system. In Tender Mercies Duvall played the troubled troubador. Here, he is careful not to upstage Bridges, and gives a very supportive understated performance. There's a scene where he sings one of Bad's songs on a fishing trip they take together. He doesn't sound that great A Cappella, but he sounds sincere, and you can tell that Bad's song means a lot to him.The story of Crazy Heart is not a typical one of love conquers all, or even the typical musician bio about the long struggle to reach the top. It's a down hill ride, where the exalted peak is vaguely remembered, and the struggle is more about accepting that your best years are over. It is way past the time to start aging gracefully. Maggie Gyllenhaal was great as the journalist who temporarily falls for him, but then realizes that her son isn't safe with him if Bad starts drinking. Her name was Jean Craddock, reminding me of my sister Joanie Craddock, who is a George Strait fan, though there the resemblance ends.T-Bone Burnett did the music for O, Brother, Where Art Thou? and also The Big Lebowski (Bridges was The Dude). As usual, T-Bone handled the music superbly. Stephen Bruton was kind of the model for Bad Blake. He lived the Bad Blake life of a musician on the road. He also wrote music for the film but passed away just before it was finished, and the film is dedicated to his memory. He was kind of a consultant. The Sparkletts jug was his idea.The Bottom Line is Crazy Heart rates 5 stars for Bridges' Oscar winning performance, and for the great supporting cast of Maggie Gyllenhaal, Robert Duvall, Colin Farrell, and the rest. With T-Bone Burnett handling the music it was as real and right as it gets. The story was kind of low key and lacking in a Hollywood ending, much to its credit. Scott Cooper, the director and writer, brought out the 'Crazy Heart' of the Thomas Cobb novel. And as always, the dude abides.

The romance between the two main characters was not convincing to me, although Maggie Gyllenhaal's mastery of the erotic was excellent, as always.The inconsistent editing gave a disjointed air to the movie (e.g. see the excellent comment by reviewer Mark Blackburn about the missing scene), while the cinematography was very good, and the sound quality was excellent as well, the latter two qualities being well served by the blu ray release.Maybe it was just me, but it seemed like the main character's music was better when he was dysfunctional, and a little on the boring side when he was functional.The movie also seemed like a bit of an Alcoholics Anonymous recruiting vehicle, which is fine for people who are helped, but struck me as a bit tedious and heavy handed.My two favorite scenes, in addition to Gyllenhaal's carrying the love scenes, were at the beginning when Bad gets out of his truck and emptys out the jug, and his back and forth with the sound man during a rehearsal for an opening an act for a concert by Tommy.  Jeff Bridges and Colin Farrell both give convincing musical performances, and Robert Duval is always fun to watch, although his cameo appearance is brief.And, it would be churlish not to mention the wonderful performances by the back up bands who perform in the movie, and, once again, the excellent sound engineering.",3,"Meh.

Not being a country music fan, it was difficult for me to totally get into this movie.  However, Jeff Bridges' turn as Bad Blake resonates with pain, heart break, and redemption, so those little intangibles that make a so-so movie good definitely come through.  I thought Bridges' singing was actually quite good, and some of the songs were poignant and well-written.  Bridges looked right at home on stage performing in front of thousands of fans.The love story within the movie seemed less genuine to me.  I never quite believed that Maggie Gyllenhaal's character had really fallen that hard for Bad Blake, perhaps because of the obvious age difference between the characters, but more because I never saw any real spark.  I guess one could argue that these two people might not be able to totally give themselves to each other because of the pain they've endured in the past.  Self-preservation has a way of walling off true feelings, and it shows between these two.  Regardless, you're always rooting for Blake because of the many redeeming qualities he has.The Blu-ray version of the film looks and sounds really good.  The live musical performances sound terrific.  The images are crisp and clear.  There are many scenes with vast open spaces dotted with mountains and clouds in the distance.  It all looks very pretty.  Whether or not this disc is worthy of a buy would depend on your opinion about country music and movies about redemption/alcoholism.

1334125,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B0039UT3LK,Craig Whittle,"[1, 1]","CRAZY HEARTSTARRING: Jeff Bridges, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Collin Farrell, Robert Duvall, Jack Nation, James Keane, Tom Bower, Ryil Adamson, Rick Dial, J. Michael Oliva, Beth Grant and Debrianna MansiniWRITTEN BY: Scott Cooper; based on the novel by Thomas CobbDIRECTED BY: Scott CooperRated: RGenre: DramaRelease Date: 16 December 2009It's refreshing to know that a movie about something you have absolutely no interest in (Country music), can keep you enthralled for nearly two hours. Of course Crazy Heart is about more than just Country music, but still... it's nice.At the time of writing this, I have yet to see Invictus or A Single Man, so Jeff Bridges has my vote among those nominated for an Oscar by an actor in a leading role.Bridges is marvelous in this film. His character is not. His name is Bad Blake and he may have at one time been something to marvel over, as a somewhat famous Country music artist. We meet him long after any days of success or cheerfulness were upon him.In the film's opening shot, he emerges from his 1978 suburban in a drunken stupor, delivering a very hilarious line in regards to his current situation: he's diminished to performing at a bowling alley. If it sounds bad to you and me, it's far more of a disappointment to Bad Blake. What makes the film so enjoyable though is Blake's inability to allow himself to fold to self-defeat; no matter how pathetic or embarrassing things get for him, he accepts them.Such is the case, when Blake is informed by his agent that he has a gig to open for none-other than his long-lost prot&eacute;g&eacute;; a kid who made it bigger than Blake could have ever hoped to of, by doing everything Blake ever taught him. His name is Tommy and we hear a great deal of him prior to seeing him in the film. It's a very nice build-up to the welcoming appearance of the sensational Collin Farrell. Farrell was overlooked for yet another Oscar nomination for his performance as Tommy; his other from 2009 being The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.Tommy wants maybe nothing more than to repay Blake for the kindness he showed him. Blake could not be more offended by this however, and we see his drinking problem gradually become worse.  Booze solves most hiccups in Blake's life; in theory at least.Blake is not exactly `happy' with his life, but may not be aware of it until he meets a young woman who shows him a bit of himself. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Jane, an aspiring writer, interviewing Blake for a story.While learning about Blake through the interview, Jane teaches us that Blake has sore spots regarding questions of his past relationships and as to whether or not he has any children. Soon we learn that he has long since lost contact with his 28-year-old son. As he and Jane start-up a romance together, he begins to take an interest with developing a fatherly like relationship to her four-year-old son; ironically the same age of his son when Blake last saw him.This is not the `feel good movie of the year' and it doesn't try to be. It's a very realistic look at a life many people have lived in reality. If you haven't lived it yourself, chances are you know of someone who has had great potential, but drowned nearly all of it with alcohol or some other meaningless evil substance.Crazy Heart stands out with other great movies like The Wrestler, Sherrybaby , Blow and Monster; it delivers a fascinating story, glorious acting and a uniquely innovative style of filmmaking.Crazy Heart is a must-see for anyone pursuing a career in independent film. If a first time writer and director like Scott Cooper can put together an adapted screenplay as beautiful as this, and then direct it and somehow attract the attention of such talents as Bridges, Gyllenhaal, Farrell and even the legendary Robert Duvall (he plays Blake's best friend); then that ought to serve as a genuine piece of hope to anyone engulfed in aspiration.",4,Crazy Heart Review,1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,3900,"['CRAZY', 'HEARTSTARRING', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Jack', 'Nation', 'James', 'Keane', 'Tom', 'Bower', 'Ryil', 'Adamson', 'Rick', 'Dial', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Oliva', 'Beth', 'Grant', 'Debrianna', 'MansiniWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Scott', 'Cooper', 'based', 'novel', 'Thomas', 'CobbDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Scott', 'CooperRated', 'RGenre', 'DramaRelease', 'Date', '16', 'December', '2009It', 'refreshing', 'know', 'movie', 'something', 'have', 'absolutely', 'interest', 'Country', 'music', 'can', 'keep', 'enthralled', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'course', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'more', 'just', 'Country', 'music', 'still', 'time', 'writing', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Invictus', 'A', 'Single', 'Man', 'so', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'vote', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'actor', 'leading', 'role.Bridges', 'marvelous', 'film', 'character', 'not', 'name', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'may', 'have', 'one', 'time', 'been', 'something', 'marvel', 'over', 'somewhat', 'famous', 'Country', 'music', 'artist', 'meet', 'long', 'days', 'success', 'cheerfulness', 'were', 'upon', 'film', 'opening', 'shot', '1978', 'suburban', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'delivering', 'very', 'hilarious', 'line', 'regards', 'current', 'situation', 'diminished', 'performing', 'bowling', 'alley', 'bad', 'far', 'more', 'disappointment', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'What', 'film', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'though', 'Blake', 'inability', 'allow', 'fold', 'self-defeat', 'matter', 'how', 'pathetic', 'embarrassing', 'things', 'get', 'them.Such', 'case', 'when', 'Blake', 'informed', 'agent', 'gig', 'open', 'none-other', 'long-lost', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'kid', 'who', 'made', 'bigger', 'Blake', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'hoped', 'doing', 'everything', 'Blake', 'ever', 'taught', 'name', 'Tommy', 'hear', 'great', 'deal', 'prior', 'seeing', 'film', 'very', 'nice', 'build-up', 'welcoming', 'appearance', 'sensational', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'Farrell', 'was', 'overlooked', 'yet', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'Tommy', 'other', '2009', 'being', 'Imaginarium', 'Doctor', 'Parnassus.Tommy', 'maybe', 'nothing', 'more', 'repay', 'Blake', 'kindness', 'showed', 'Blake', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'offended', 'however', 'see', 'drinking', 'problem', 'gradually', 'become', 'worse', 'Booze', 'most', 'hiccups', 'Blake', 'life', 'theory', 'least.Blake', 'not', 'exactly', 'happy', 'life', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'aware', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'bit', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jane', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'interviewing', 'Blake', 'story.While', 'learning', 'Blake', 'interview', 'Jane', 'Blake', 'sore', 'spots', 'regarding', 'questions', 'past', 'relationships', 'not', 'children', 'Soon', 'learn', 'long', 'lost', 'contact', '28-year-old', 'son', 'Jane', 'start-up', 'romance', 'together', 'take', 'interest', 'developing', 'fatherly', 'like', 'relationship', 'four-year-old', 'son', 'ironically', 'same', 'age', 'son', 'when', 'Blake', 'last', 'saw', 'him.This', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'year', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'very', 'realistic', 'look', 'life', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'lived', 'reality', 'have', ""n't"", 'lived', 'chances', 'are', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'drowned', 'nearly', 'alcohol', 'other', 'meaningless', 'evil', 'substance.Crazy', 'Heart', 'out', 'other', 'great', 'movies', 'Wrestler', 'Sherrybaby', 'Blow', 'Monster', 'fascinating', 'story', 'glorious', 'acting', 'uniquely', 'innovative', 'style', 'filmmaking.Crazy', 'Heart', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'pursuing', 'career', 'independent', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'writer', 'director', 'Scott', 'Cooper', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'as', 'beautiful', 'then', 'direct', 'somehow', 'attract', 'attention', 'such', 'talents', 'Bridges', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Farrell', 'even', 'legendary', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Blake', 'best', 'friend', 'then', 'ought', 'serve', 'genuine', 'piece', 'hope', 'anyone', 'engulfed', 'aspiration']",Crazy Heart

There's a lot of old singers roaming around the country and you can catch them in your local bar once in awhile. This movie showed the hardships of such a life and how drinking makes things worse for someone. Maggie Gyllenhaal did a good job, she was probably a little too good looking to connect with an old singer like this, but thats Hollywood and its not uncommon to see a woman with an older man.

1334128,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0039UT3LK,DanD,"[0, 1]","Bad Blake is a washed up country singer: think Kris Kristofferson meets Waylon Jennings, with a little Haggard thrown in for good measure.  Once a headliner, in this day and age of pop-country superstars (like former Blake-protege Tommy Sweet), Blake has been reduced to bowling alleys and hicktown bars, where he despises his fans just as much as he relies on them.  Forced into a world of constant drinking and one-night stands with the few people who still remember him, Blake suddenly finds himself falling for a local reporter, at the same time Tommy Sweet comes to him with a career-reviving (and ego-busting) proposition.CRAZY HEART isn't a big film.  It's often described as ""little,"" and that is one of its three great strengths: it's intimate, you feel for these characters that you've seen before in other films.  They seem original, even if they aren't.  The second strength is the music: written by T. Bone Burnett, up-and-comer Ryan Bingham, and the late Stephen Bruton, the music is real, relevant, and soulful.  The theme song (Bingham's ""The Weary Kind"") is a knockout, and the rest of the soundtrack is almost as spectacular.  Farrell and Bridges are surprisingly good singers, with voices that fit their characters to a T.The third strength is Jeff Bridges.  Sure, the rest of the cast is great; Farrell has the slick Tim McGraw thing going; Maggie Gyllenhaal is surprisingly endearing and sympathetic; Robert Duvall makes the most of a minor role; and the rest of the supporting cast pulls all the right punches.  But make no mistake: this is Jeff Bridges's film.  It's easily one of the finest performances of his career; think the Dude twenty years later, living this life not because he chose it, but because it's been forced onto him.

His work here as a broken down alcoholic country singer is no exception.  These type of roles bring out the ham in some actors but Bridges' Bad Blake mostly suffers in silence.  Bad has been down so long that when they deny him a bar tab at a bowling alley gig he just lights a cigarette in knowing recognition.  ""Crazy Heart"" is a personal journey for Bad from downtrodedness no some form of personal redemption.  It's not a pleasant journey but it is a fascinating one.  Besides Bridges the film's cast is terrific starting with Maggie Gyllenhaal's sympathetic girlfriend, Colin Farrell as a former protogee of Bad's whose made the big time, and the irrepressible Robert Duvall as an old friend of Bad's who demonstrates the tough love that others are unable to give.  If Bridges' work here reminded me of anything it was Duvall's in ""Tender Mercies"" back in 1983.

I've experienced temperamental musicians and the antics of same backstage; I know about all the booze (and other substances) and the traveling and the one-night stands.  So this simple story about a washed-up former country star finding redemption in the arms of a younger woman (only to later ruin it) was remarkably appealing to me and warmed my heart.  And I'm not much of a country music fan, but the music and singing performances in this film (both by Bridges and Farrell) are wondrously believable.Jeff Bridges brings a sympathetic honesty to his role as Bad Blake; through all the drinking and smoking and complaining and unraveling we realize that Blake just wants to love, and be loved in return.  And there is a true heart of gold in that mistreated chest.  There is a redemption, of sorts, when the film comes to its conclusion, and the viewer finds comfort and solace in the fact Blake is now at peace with himself.  Other excellent performances include Maggie Gyllenhaal as Blake's young love interest, Colin Ferrell playing a former pupil of Blake's who's now reached superstardom, and the always spot on Robert Duvall as an enabling buddy.

For she too is compelling in the portrayal of the well-intentioned person who believes she can reform and transform the man with whom she has fallen in love.The plot is somewhat predictable, and so there are really no surprises. In brief, Bad Blake (the character Bridges plays), upon meeting Jean (Maggie G.), attempts to reform. He even cleans up his act enough that he is welcomed by Jean, a single mom, into her home, at which time he forms a bond with her son. However, he begins drinking again, with predictably disastrous consequences. As a result, Jean leaves him and tells him to stay out of her life.Despite the lack of a really deep plot, the individual scenes are for the most part suspenseful and hold one's attention.

1334135,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B0039UT3LK,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","CRAZY HEART tells a familiar tale of a washed-up country music singer Otis (aka Bad) Blake (Jeff Bridges), who spends much of his time touring seedy venues in New Mexico and Texas, singing his old songs and drinking himself to distraction.  He takes up with journalist Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal), but this relationship comes to grief when Bad inadvertently loses her four-year-old son Buddy (Jack Nation) in a crowded shopping mall.  Bad ends up sharing a bill with his one-time proteg&eacute; Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell); while resenting the latter's success, Bad eventually comes to realize that Tommy will provide him with the only means of financial salvation.  If Bad writes new songs, Tommy will sing them and pay handsomely.  Jeff Bridges gives a bravura performance in the central role - at once aggressive, vulnerable, pig-headed, lonely yet self-willed, he comes across as someone in perpetual need of human company, yet reluctant to reveal anything about himself to others.  It is as if he cannot bear to face the truth about his washed-up show-business career, or his descent into alcoholism.  The photography by Barry Markowitz is breathtaking, especially his ability to show the insignificance of human beings - and their actions - when set against the rolling landscape.  Tommy might be able to play in front of 12,000 people, but he can never achieve immortality.  The only criticism that might be leveled at Scott Cooper's film is the ending, which shows Bad making rather too speedy a recovery, while making some unconvincing suggestions about Jean's life once she has split up with Bad.  Would someone with such a professed reputation for finding the wrong man be so happily married now?  Bad's recovery from alcoholism seems equally forced; for someone with such a long relationship with the bottle, it seems inconceivable that he should be cured after just one course of treatment.

The smaller implausibility is that the sensitive, appealing young woman played by Maggie Gyllenhall would swoon in the company of the surly, paunchy, scuzzy whiskey-stinking has-been country singer acted by Jeff Bridges, whose portrayal of ""Bad Blake"" would be aptly convincing for a street drunk refusing to spend a night in a shelter, but is 'over the top' for a semi-functional dude even as wasted as Bad. The larger implausibility is Bad's sketchily-scripted miraculous recovery from decades of SERIOUS alcoholism, all in 'one swell foop' as my boozy Daddy used to say, at a posh retreat replete with expensive serenity.

But unless you are willing to spend the first two-thirds or more of the long film watching him vomit and misbehave, long enough to see his typical AA turnaround and attempt to make up for the deeds soaked in his alcoholic past, you may tire of the theme.  Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a solid performance as a woman so bruised by her men of the past that she is able to catch a glimpse into the potential of Bad Blake.  Colin Farrell makes a brief but significant appearance as one of the reasons for Bad's going off track. The rest of the cast feels well in tune with the country western crowd and makes us understand the need for music heroes.  But in the end it is just another hard luck story, of which there are just too many.  Maybe reading Thomas Cobb's novel by the same name would provide more reason to care about Bad than we do.

Growing up with the flashier legends like Pacino and DeNiro, a guy like Bridges just sneaks up on you.  Looking back over the movies that are among my favorites, it was eye opening to realize how many he was in.  Seabiscuit, The Big Lebowski, and now Crazy Heart.Fans of Bridges should definitely see this movie.  He was richly deserving of the Oscar nod.  I had no idea that he could play and sing.  I find the Bad Blake character to be (mostly) sympathetic and (entirely) believable.  And the music is terrific.Robert Duvall, no doubt included as a nod to Tender Mercies, is a welcome addition and delivers as usual.Now, as to why this movie doesn't rate a perfect five stars.I thing Maggie G may be a tad overrated as an actress.  I get the younger woman/fading star thing.  But I still coudln't buy THAT big of a disparity.  A more mature actress, maybe by just 10 years, would have been less startling in the role.  It lowered the authenticity of the movie, IMO.The other problem is the believability of an obviously attractive and intelligent woman putting her child in that situation.  Even her character admits as much at some point in the movie, but I just couldn't buy it.The other problem I have is Colin Ferrell.  Now, I know maybe he was supposed to be ""not so believable"" since he was contrasted to Blake--so if that's the idea I sort of get it.  Can't think of who I would have put there instead, actually, I just know he didn't quite work for me.  But then I've never really liked any of his performances so it may vary with your tastes.I can't rate it as a ""perfect"" five stars, but I can rate it as a ""must see"" for Bridges fans, and as one of my favorites.

1334144,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B0039UT3LK,Gregor von Kallahann,"[0, 0]","Well, this is the time of year when all the likely Oscar nominated movies are scheduled to hit the screen, and for the second year in a row, Jeff Bridges is getting a lot of buzz for his performance in TRUE GRIT.  I'm looking forward to seeing that one--and recalling his last year's star turn (and Oscar winning performance) in CRAZY HEART, a movie that succeeded at laying bare some truths about the music biz, while not quite hitting the mark on other points. Basically, it was a pretty good music biz story--understated for the most part, probably pretty accurate in a lot of ways.Some things just did not jibe, however. The disparity in fame and fortune between Jeff Bridges character and Colin Farrell's younger superstar was probably a tad unrealistic, since Colin's Tommy Sweet (not really the greatest name for a C&W; singer) seemed to be taking every chance to tout Jeff's Bad Blake as his musical mentor. That kind of very public praise may not be enough to elevate his former friend and partner to superstar status , but would he really be reduced to playing bowling alleys? Still it seems to hit on some basic--and pretty harsh--truths about the music biz nowadays. Interesting that Robert Duvall has a pretty big part and is listed as one of the film's producers since the film it most reminded me of was his own TENDER MERCIES.I've met a lot of musicians who tour like crazy and who rely on local ""pick-up bandsfor backing.  That's one element that the movie threw in that rang very true.  Working with such groups saves the artist a ton of money, but limits their performance in very real ways.  Ever wonder why the artist you've paid to see seems to be ignoring your repeatedly shouted out request?  It's because a. s/he's SICK unto death of it or b. this evening's band never rehearsed it and it too complicated to fake.  I was tickled to see that element introduced into this movie.  It just may educate a few folks to some music biz realities.Whether you see other elements of the film as realistic or not depends on your point of view.  Bridges character's relationship with a much younger woman is dramatically plausible, but it also seems something like a cinematic cliche.  Old coots getting it on with attractive young women--well, it does happen, but I'm waiting for the day when they film a story about a washed up female C&W; singer who's cougaring up the Southwest.  But the film ends on a whistful, but realistic note.  No happy endings, really, but maybe a small victory or two.I doubt Jeff Bridges will score another Oscar this year, but unless I miss my guess, he's up for another nod.  He's at the age and stage where his body of work is starting to be recognized, and you can certainly make a case that last year's win was deserved.  He was excellent in a pretty good movie.

This film immediately transformed ME into it's own world with just one central character played masterfully by a man who's name I'm sorry I can't recall, oh yes, Jeff Bridges. Maggie Gylenhaal looks inviting and acts like the only way she knows how to. Oh come on, I meant it in a very good way. She's one of my favourites. The music is very stylish, I wish they could've given way to some more music like Kenny Rogers' Coward of the county but then again I am no establishment on country and what it means to the rest of America but still I felt they could've taken the artistic license a little more and further delved into country by having longer songs.

But my point of contentionabout this film is that it has been done (at least the formula of it)3 or 4 times already to my knowledge in my lifetime.There was ""Tender Mercies"", which was a classic Robert Duvall (who playedBridge's father in this) film which had alot of the emotional pathosof this film. Then there was the 1982 Clint Eastwood film ""Honky Tonk Man""which had Clint playing a Hank Williams Sr.-like character (except inthe 1930's) who was a talented country artist who was gruff andself-destructive but managed to redeem himself right before his deathof alcholism & tuberculosis. There are at least two others which escapeme now, but you get the gist of what I'm saying, right?Again, I'm not negating this film, so much as just saying it's been done.Colin Farrell, aside from Bridges, gave a great performance in this as well.He adored Bridges character and always acknowledged him as his mentor,and even wanted him to write some songs for him.But Bridge's character was too caught up in his own self-destructionand self-loathing to see that he was indeed worthy & capable.He also is a bit jealous of Farrell's characters' youth, charisma,and the fact that he is getting paid far more than he ever dreamedof in his youthful prime! He falls in love with Maggie Gyllenhall,a reporter, who has been shell-shocked by past lovers and has a child.Bridges has regrets of his own...he has a grown son who will have nothingto do with him, even though Bridges is older & more reflective of the mistakeshe made in his youth and tries to reach out to him. He transfers his lovefor the son whose childhood he missed onto Maggie Gyllenhall's young son.Things are good between them for awhile until something bad happens dueto Bridge's characters drinking....then it deteriorates quickly.After hitting rock bottom, he finally decides to get out of his own wayand get it together once and for all. The film ends on a high note.Overall, it falls into the slightly above average category for me.It was good to see Jeff Bridges finally get acknowledged by SAG,The Golden Globes, and win the coveted best actor Oscar though.But moreso for his total body of work over the years.",4,"Decent Movie, But Haven't We Seen This Formula Before 3 or 4 Times??",1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,2444,"['Not', 'taking', 'anything', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'who', 'always', 'given', 'mostnatural', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'long', 'career', 'definitely', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'stellar', 'actors', 'actresses', 'wellwho', 'do', 'jobs', 'well', 'film', 'point', 'contentionabout', 'film', 'been', 'done', 'least', 'formula', '3', '4', 'times', 'already', 'knowledge', 'lifetime.There', 'was', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'was', 'classic', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'playedBridge', 'father', 'film', 'had', 'alot', 'emotional', 'pathosof', 'film', 'Then', 'was', '1982', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'Honky', 'Tonk', 'Man', 'had', 'Clint', 'playing', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'Sr.-like', 'character', 'inthe', '1930', 'who', 'was', 'talented', 'country', 'artist', 'who', 'was', 'gruff', 'andself-destructive', 'managed', 'redeem', 'right', 'deathof', 'alcholism', 'tuberculosis', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'others', 'escapeme', 'now', 'get', 'gist', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'right', 'Again', ""'m"", 'not', 'negating', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'saying', 'been', 'done.Colin', 'Farrell', 'aside', 'Bridges', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'well.He', 'adored', 'Bridges', 'character', 'always', 'acknowledged', 'mentor', 'even', 'wanted', 'write', 'songs', 'him.But', 'Bridge', 'character', 'was', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'self-destructionand', 'self-loathing', 'see', 'was', 'indeed', 'worthy', 'capable.He', 'also', 'bit', 'jealous', 'Farrell', 'characters', 'youth', 'charisma', 'fact', 'getting', 'paid', 'far', 'more', 'ever', 'youthful', 'prime', 'love', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhall', 'reporter', 'who', 'been', 'shell-shocked', 'past', 'lovers', 'child.Bridges', 'regrets', 'own', 'grown', 'son', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'nothingto', 'do', 'even', 'Bridges', 'older', 'more', 'reflective', 'mistakeshe', 'made', 'youth', 'tries', 'reach', 'out', 'lovefor', 'son', 'childhood', 'missed', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhall', 'young', 'son.Things', 'are', 'good', 'awhile', 'something', 'bad', 'dueto', 'Bridge', 'characters', 'drinking', '.then', 'quickly.After', 'hitting', 'rock', 'bottom', 'finally', 'get', 'own', 'wayand', 'get', 'together', 'once', 'film', 'high', 'note.Overall', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'category', 'me.It', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'finally', 'get', 'acknowledged', 'SAG', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'win', 'coveted', 'best', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'though.But', 'moreso', 'total', 'body', 'work', 'years']",Crazy Heart

1334152,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B0039UT3LK,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[56, 59]","Nominated for Oscars in the Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best song race Crazy Heart is the character study of a country music legend spiraling down a rabbit hole of alcohol addiction. Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) is a country music legend who's currently down on his luck, forced to play bowling alleys and small bars while his young former protege Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) plays the big gigs. Constantly drunk, Bad Blake becomes friendly with a single mother, Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who interviews him for a local Arizona newspaper. When things go wrong in their relationship, though, do in part to his alcoholism, Bad Blake re-examines his life and addictions.Jeff Bridges is a legend. Son of Lloyd Bridges (remember McCroskey from Airplane!: ""Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines""), Bridges got his start at a young age guesting on many of his father's TV shows when they needed a kid to play a small part. Since then he's been nominated for five Oscars (including his current nomination for Crazy Heart), and has played iconic characters from Kevin Flynn in TRON to The Dude in The Big Lebowski. With the body of work that he's amassed over the years, it's hard to believe that Jeff Bridges calls Bad Blake the role of a lifetime and the work he's most proud of. And considering he's the front runner for the Best Actor race at this year it would seem that it might possibly be his best work, which is really saying something.Crazy Heart is the type of movie that is really made by it's acting and music choices. It's not the type of movie that makes any huge bold new declarations, or tries to really do anything particularly new, but that's also it's charm. It makes some choices that you don't completely expect, such as you'd think that Bad Blake's animosity toward Tommy Sweet would come from Sweet being a prick, but that's not the case. Also the ending isn't the sweet ending you'd expect from this type of movie either. These changes are refreshing as the movie tries to be it's own movie and not a mix of cliches. What this movie is, is a great character study of a man who used to be great, but has fallen into the mire and is trying to dig his way back out but doesn't know how.What the movie really comes down to, though, is the acting which can be seen in the nominations it's received. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Jeff Bridges, despite a 28 year difference in age, really show great chemistry on the screen. This is one of the most important part of the movie, because this is what really drives the last act of the movie, and for the last act to be believable, the chemistry has to be believable. Jeff Bridges really steals the show, but I don't think anyone doubted his abilities. Here, though, he truly shines and develops a character that you love even though he's got more than his fare share of faults. I also have to mention Colin Farrell. At first, he didn't seem too believable as a country star, but you really get that impression before you even hear him open his mouth. In the end he makes a serviceable country star, and I think he did extremely well. To add to that he, as well as Jeff Bridges, did his own singing in the movie which thoroughly impressed me as well.This is another movie that I don't really have anything bad to say about. The acting is amazing, the music is transcendent, and while the movie could have easily succumbed to cliches it avoids them with ease. I think this is what all musical biopics should be about. If you like music biopics, character studies, good music, or simply movies with great acting I highly recommend this movie.5/5",5,Crazy Heart,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,3627,"['Nominated', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Best', 'song', 'race', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'character', 'study', 'country', 'music', 'legend', 'spiraling', 'down', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'country', 'music', 'legend', 'who', 'currently', 'down', 'luck', 'forced', 'play', 'bowling', 'alleys', 'small', 'bars', 'young', 'former', 'protege', 'Tommy', 'Sweet', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'big', 'gigs', 'Constantly', 'drunk', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'friendly', 'single', 'mother', 'Jean', 'Craddock', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'local', 'Arizona', 'newspaper', 'When', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'relationship', 'though', 'do', 'part', 'alcoholism', 'Bad', 'Blake', 're-examines', 'life', 'addictions.Jeff', 'Bridges', 'legend', 'Son', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'remember', 'McCroskey', 'Airplane', 'picked', 'wrong', 'week', 'quit', 'amphetamines', 'Bridges', 'got', 'start', 'young', 'age', 'guesting', 'many', 'father', 'TV', 'shows', 'when', 'needed', 'kid', 'play', 'small', 'part', 'then', 'been', 'nominated', 'five', 'Oscars', 'including', 'current', 'nomination', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'played', 'iconic', 'characters', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'TRON', 'Dude', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'body', 'work', 'amassed', 'years', 'hard', 'believe', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'role', 'lifetime', 'work', 'most', 'proud', 'considering', 'front', 'runner', 'Best', 'Actor', 'race', 'year', 'would', 'seem', 'might', 'possibly', 'be', 'best', 'work', 'really', 'saying', 'something.Crazy', 'Heart', 'type', 'movie', 'really', 'made', 'acting', 'music', 'choices', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'huge', 'bold', 'new', 'declarations', 'tries', 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'particularly', 'new', 'also', 'charm', 'choices', 'do', ""n't"", 'completely', 'expect', 'such', ""'d"", 'think', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'animosity', 'Tommy', 'Sweet', 'would', 'come', 'Sweet', 'being', 'prick', 'not', 'case', 'Also', 'ending', ""n't"", 'sweet', 'ending', ""'d"", 'expect', 'type', 'movie', 'changes', 'are', 'refreshing', 'movie', 'be', 'own', 'movie', 'not', 'mix', 'cliches', 'What', 'movie', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'man', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'great', 'fallen', 'mire', 'trying', 'dig', 'way', 'back', 'out', ""n't"", 'know', 'how.What', 'movie', 'really', 'down', 'though', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'nominations', 'received', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', '28', 'year', 'difference', 'age', 'really', 'show', 'great', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'movie', 'what', 'really', 'last', 'act', 'movie', 'last', 'act', 'be', 'believable', 'chemistry', 'be', 'believable', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'really', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'doubted', 'abilities', 'Here', 'though', 'truly', 'shines', 'character', 'love', 'even', 'got', 'more', 'fare', 'share', 'faults', 'also', 'have', 'mention', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'believable', 'country', 'star', 'really', 'get', 'impression', 'even', 'hear', 'open', 'mouth', 'end', 'serviceable', 'country', 'star', 'think', 'did', 'extremely', 'well', 'add', 'as', 'well', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'did', 'own', 'singing', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'impressed', 'well.This', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'anything', 'bad', 'say', 'acting', 'amazing', 'music', 'transcendent', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'succumbed', 'cliches', 'ease', 'think', 'what', 'musical', 'biopics', 'should', 'be', 'about', 'like', 'music', 'biopics', 'character', 'studies', 'good', 'music', 'simply', 'movies', 'great', 'acting', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie.5/5']",Crazy Heart

We watch as drink after drink, smoke after smoke, this guy goes downhill. He's often in a stupor. He travels around the country in his old jalopy playing gigs at dumps and joints including a bowling alley. Everything that can go wrong seems to go wrong in this guy's' life and in his abortive love life. Although he's bottom fishing, he still seems to be able to perform. In his day he'd written some pretty good songs, He looks terrible, his craggy face mirroring his miserable life, and his hair a tangled mess.It would be too kind to call this movie a downer. Bridges does a great job of acting; he won an Oscar for the role, but be warned that you may end up with as much depression as he has. Don't watch it if you're feeling down unless you believe misery thrives on misery.Maggie Gyllenhaal almost loses her son because of his carelessness. Colin Farrell does an excellent job as the Western star Tommy Sweet who got where he is because of Blake. He wants Blake to write some new songs for him. Bridges does his own singing, somewhat boozy sounding.Hollywood loves movies about down-and-outers struggling toward redemption. Remember last year's ""The Wrestler""?Many of us go to the movies to see either something upbeat, something uplifting, something entertaining or intellectually challenging. (""The Ghost Writer"" is a good example.) For many this movie is going to be okay because of the country Western music and because of Bridges's tour de force acting, but for me it was a chore to sit through.

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[10, 12]","It's easy to understand how Anthony Hopkins won a Best Acting role for playing Hannibal Lector--that's a mighty big step away from one's core. But to win the Academy Award for playing a low-key role, such as Bad Blake, a washed-out, mostly drunk country singer, is a fine achievement for perennially excellent actor Jeff Bridges in ""Crazy Heart."" In fact, I suspect he won for a lifetime achievement with this latest role, simply the next in a long line of outstanding acting.This is a film I wanted to see because of Bridges but dreaded because I know he plays a man who drinks. My father was a drinker. It's not a pretty sight or experience. Instead, I saw a working drunk, a man who could and did work right through his drinking, just as my father did. But the bottom line: working drunk is not living fully. And that's what this movie is about: not living a life fully and directly.Bridges plays a washed-out (repeated phrase for a purpose) country singer, clinging to a living just enough to get the next bottle for the gig. Just how low has Bad sunk? He drives himself from one bowling alley lounge to bar to truck stop in the hot, arid western states, the heat simply reflecting the unwashed appearance that Bad carries with him, clean or not. That nasty film of drink, smoke, rock-bottom life clings to him, clean or not.How many years has Bad lived this way? Too many. How many more until he drinks himself to death? In the beginning he wrote songs that paved his way, but that was long ago. Until he has a gig in Sante Fe in a little nightclub where he promised the owner/piano player to allow his niece to interview him. Maggie Gyllenhaall plays Janie, also a drifter through life, at a crossroads, a single mom trying to find her way as a reporter. I was touched by her also perfect performance. For some reason she is attracted to this stinky, sweaty, aging country singer.The redeeming grace--as there must be one in such a story--comes through Janie's son. Bad really connects with the boy as much as he does with Janie. The horror scene involving the boy displays that award-winning acting by Bridges. Oh my, his facial expressions, his body language made me feel his own terror at what he had done--or not done. What place Bridges had to go in his psyche to find that terror must have given him nightmares!That point in time changes Bad. For a rare moment in my movie watching history, I found myself not hoping or cheering or wishing for the character, just watching to discover what he would do. That next section of the story, that acting also congealed Bridges's winning performance. It is so perfect.To his extra credit, Bridges sings. Frankly, he could make a living at it. He sings a number of times. Colin Farrell as Bad's former friend and current nemesis (only in Bad's mind) also sings. It's a country music movie with excellent performances, alone worth the price of your ticket. But to see Jeff Bridges take a simple role of a less-than-admirable man and make the viewer want that man to be better is the real reason to see this film. The singing is just part of that performance.It's the quiet dramas that reflect life in all its aspects that make us want to continue going to the movies.

Now he drags himself across the southwest in a car that could breakdown at any minute, playing whatever small gigs his agent can find with pick-up bands he fears are getting paid more than he is. He drinks so much he sweats whiskey. At one of his shows, small town reporter Jean Craddock (Maggie Gylenhaal) interviews him, and over a couple glasses of whiskey he falls for her. Despite her previous bad experiences with men she takes a chance on Bad. And for a while Bad vicariously experiences the family life he missed with his wife and child.The relationship with Jean, which at first seems like the classic older leading man mismatch with the younger woman that wouldn't necessarily happen in real life. But Gylenhaal plays Jean that is desperate in her own way. She may not be at the end of her road like Bad is, but she definitely feels like she's backed into a corner, and the relationship between the two feels real.Crazy Heart is as gently paced as a Country Western song. Colin Farrell appears in a nicely understated role as Tommy Sweet, a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Bad's who has hit the big time and is trying to help his former mentor out. Unfortunately, Bad resents Tommy's success and the opportunities he tries to steer Bad's way. Robert Duvall plays the voice of wisdom in Bad's life as his hometown bar owner. Bridges does his own singing in Crazy Heart and really works to the advantage of the character. Bridges' untrained voice exemplifies Bad's broken voice and broken life.To answer the question posed by my review's title, where do you go when you hit the end of the road? Hopefully, you find yourself again. I don't know if this role will garner Bridges an Academy Award nomination, but it's a solid performance and you should find this movie.Bonus Features: The DVD doesn't contain any bonus or special features.

This was shortly after the Oscars where Jeff Bridges had been named Queen of the May and I guess I was thinking, oh, what the heck, how bad could it be?  Over the years I've seen my share of Jeff Bridges movies and some of them have been real keepers.  Why, he began with a pair of aces--Thunderbolt and Lightfoot and The Last Picture Show.  After that, he should have run the whole show in Hollywood but I don't know what happened: bad choices perhaps.  He's always great but for the past 30 years movie fans know that no matter how great Jeff is, the movie is probably going to be pretty foul.  We have a theory that he picks out roles for how crazy he gets to be in them, and thus ""Crazy Heart"" might have appealed to him from its title alone.As most of you know already, Jeff plays a washed up country singer who was popular 25 years before the movie begins, and now bad breaks have brought ""Bad Blake"" to a continual round of touring, wenching, getting trashed, and losing sight of his goals.  When he meets Jean Craddock, possibly the worst reporter ever in the movies, he gains a new purchase on life, and she decides to move in with him once his tour is over, with her charming little movie tyke, the one who played in The Courtship of Eddie's Father (TV version), Kelly McGillis' son in Witness, Dustin Hoffman's son in Kramer vs. Kramer, and you can probably spot him in the Our Gang comedies too.  Here, he likes video games, etc.  Poot Maggie Gyllenhaal has to play Jean as though she had only one thing in her mind at all times, the welfare of the child actor, who comes first, as they always do in this sort of movie.  I expect this element of child supremacy must have appealed to Jeff Bridges too, who grew up in Hollywood and probably doesn't know any different.Anyhow, this sort of movie writes itself and wins Oscars for the realism with which its stars stumble awkwardly through unfamiliar crowds, pleading with strangers, have you seen a little boy?

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 2]","Critics' most vocal denunciations of this film--that it's derivative, pulls its punches, and lets the music carry too much of the story--are all fair.  Yet I like it anyway.  Its wide-eyed lack of pretention, mixed with Jeff Bridges' laconic performance, gives it an honest texture we haven't seen much in recent movies.  And its touching theme song makes me wish I'd learned to play guitar and write songs.Former C&W; star Bad Blake (Bridges) plays third-rate dives while his former sideman sells out arenas.  Blake drinks whiskey from the bottle, has stopped caring about appearances, and feeds others' crude nostalgia.  But a cub music reporter kindles the creative spark in his withered heart, and he wants to make a new life with her... if he can subdue his demons, before they pick a fight with her demons first.I grew up listening to C&W; in the 1980s, but the music went one direction, and my life went another.  Something similar happened to Bad Blake, but he didn't follow another road; he just stopped.  He embodies the self-destructive subculture that lingers beneath country music's shiny suits, family-friendly language, and gospel songs.  But without fame's support, his dirty secrets are on the surface for his few remaining fans to witness.Toward the end, the climax and denouement feel rushed.  This movie comes from Thomas Cobb's novel, and director Scott Cooper likely compressed plenty to keep this film under two hours.

Instead of playing large arenas as his former young prot&eacute;g&eacute; played by Colin Farrell does, he plays in small town bowling alleys and is backed by teenage garage bands.  Alcohol runs his life and there is a scene where he is vomiting between sets which really displays his degradation.  At age 58, he has had four bad marriages and his life is in shambles and we can easily understand why his name is ""Bad Blake"".  Anyway, along comes a love interest - Maggie Gyllenhaal cast as a younger reporter with a 4-year old son.  They fall in love and Bridges is especially fond of the little boy.  He takes him to a playground and we can see his affection as his relationship with Gyllenhaal deepens.  Things change for Bad Blake though.  He gets a chance to open for his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and also to write some new songs. Gyllenhaal comes to visit him but he is true to his nature and messes up again.  Eventually he goes into rehabilitation.Jeff Bridges gives an outstanding performance.  He comes across as real and he made the audience care about what happens to him.  Bravo for that.  However, there are several reasons why I hold back of heartily recommending this film.  First of all it is predictable with no real surprises.  I was also disappointed in the music which tended to all seem the same to me.  Also, the acoustics were such that I could not clearly make out the lyrics of any of the songs.

The movie presented a basically tired story and told it in a fairly tired way, with an extremely lame ""AA"" moment, wherein Jeff Briges character stands up and makes his big AA admission -- a moment we've seen in a hundred other movies and tv shows.

But, the singing is not the story, the music's not the star, and Bridges' lead of an equally impeccable supporting cast is entirely credible as a hard-core, life-weathered, country-blues croaker, and as such, masterful, and there's nothing about his vocals that detracts from his characterization, the story, or the telling of it.  I only hope he deliberately let himself go, physically, for this role, and that the Oscar was worth it, because coming back from flabby, to coin a country phrase, ""It ain't easy.""It may be a spoiler to read that...the movie defies the Hollywood, happy-ending mandate, providing, instead, one that is bittersweet as it serves-up a simple truth:  there are consequences and bends made in the road taken by one's actions and decisions that sometimes, despite true and earnest efforts, can never be abated or straightened out.  It's a fact repeated in the lyric of one of the songs Bridges sings:  that the fall which brings you down starts out feeling like flying.

Quietly magnificent throughout the entire movie, he owns the Oscar on this one.""Bad Blake"" is a 57-year old country singer, drunk most of the time and shuffling with a cigarette in his gob towards another small time venue he doesn't care about. As he empties a plastic carton of piss into the parking lot of a bowling alley (having been on the road for hours), he can think about only one thing - not family, not music, not love - but how can he get a bottle of McClure's Whiskey into his liver with only $10 left in his jeans?Without any new material to make money from, wifeless for the 4th time and with deteriorating health, ""Bad"" is still a legend among his fans and when he's on stage, him and his beloved songs like ""I Don't Know"" can still cut it. But the younger bucks have replaced him - especially his despised prot&eacute;g&eacute; Tommy Sweet (a brilliantly cast Colin Farrell) who now has 3 huge articulated trucks to haul his equipment from one arena to the next and not a beat-up convertible called 'Bessie'.Then ""Bad"" gets a lucky break. He is interviewed by a local Santa Fe journalist Jean Craddock, a divorced Mum in her Thirties with a bubbly 4-year old son Buddy whom she protects from - you guessed it - 'bad' men. Yet despite all her rules, both Jean and her son Buddy fall for the charms of the big kid with the guitar and the ten-gallon hat. And on the story goes, heartbreak to joy, joy to heartbreak and back again...The support cast are convincingly enamored small town folks - Tom Bower as the store manager and Rick Dial as the local band's piano player. Colin Farrell sings amazingly well too and is a perfect foil for the aging singer (he's also superb in ""Ondine""). Significant others shimmy around Bad's constant verbal abuse too - Paul Herman as his long-suffering manager Jack Greene and Robert Duvall as the bar-owner who never seems to give up on ""Bad"" and is maybe his only real friend (Duvall is still such a great actor at 79).Although this kind of movie harks back to Duvall's own ""Tender Mercies"", it feels a lot richer in its details. There's a particularly tough scene where Bad decides to finally call his only son of 28. Bad hasn't seen him since he was 4 years of age - never helped him, never been there for him. There are very few words in the scene, but there's a lot of pain. The grown-up son is not surprisingly unforgiving - especially with his Mom having passed away two years earlier. With the receiver to his ear, there is a look on Bridge's face that is pure destruction - a horrible realization that he has caused agony with his cavalier stay-away life and won't easily get forgiveness for it. In the hands of another actor, there might have been histrionic tears when the call abruptly finishes - but Bridges just does what an alcoholic would do - not mend his ways, but look cravenly at the kitchen for a bottle to get lost in. And on it goes until he finally does something really selfish and stupid in a shopping mall with a boy who now looks at him with affection. It's brilliantly realized stuff, it really is.Niggles - his recovery is too swift and too painless - alcohol abuse over that length of time is never that easy to shake off, and even though Maggie Gyllenhaal is a magnificent actress, there's a nagging disbelief in the relationship between her character and his - would she really fall for such a car-crash as ""Bad Blake"". But these are minor points.""Crazy Heart"" (based on the novel by Thomas Cobb) isn't quiet a masterpiece, but its damn close. And while the other actors, the T-Bone Burnette music and Scott Cooper's superb direction all add so much to the film - ultimately it belongs to its leading man. Bridges imbibes it with believability and a soul few actors could even get near.As Jean asks what is it that makes a great song - Bad answers with the title of this review - ""The good ones feel like they've always been there...""

And though she has only a couple of spoken lines, the superb actress (not named, obviously in the closing credits) conveys the most  endearing blend of patience and anxious hope -- trying to will this meeting, which she has arranged, into a genuine, heart-to-heart reconciliation:  It is not to be.When things begin to turn sour, she diplomatically exits to the next room, telling ""Bad"" --  ""You could use another beer."" The camera intercuts to her face (only twice) as she listens-in on a conversation going all wrong. Her lovely face is SO expressive -- conveying perfectly her misplaced hope for a reconciliation between father and son - a hope crushed within minutes of ""Bad's"" arrival.After some cynical parrying -- with Bad's meagre attempts at conversation (""I saved this money clip for you and  always meant to give it to you"")  his son says, in a flat-toned voice that drips contempt,""You know, since you got here, you haven't asked a single thing about US -- my wife and me,"" [and that] ""you must be the most self-absorbed S.O.B. on the face of this earth.""`Bad' says, ""Call me a cab,"" and gets up to leave;  unable to look his son in the eye, he declares in obvious self-pity, ""Well, at least I TRIED."" And the viewer realizes that self-pity is the ONLY emotion left to this self-absorbed, alcoholic, `has-been.'It's a scene so poignant (and so real) it reduced this viewer to tears. How can it be left out? Usually scenes are cut if they don't actually advance the plot:  But THIS scene (you may agree) is a mini-masterpiece, fleshing out an  aspect of ""Bad's"" character - to make him even more 'three-dimensional.' And  since no other reviewer has mentioned it, I thought it was worth pointing out this one ""deleted scene.""

1334180,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0039UT3LK,Mark Turner,"[3, 3]","One of the true good things to happen this past Oscar night was to see Jeff Bridges win for best actor. He's done a number of great roles and should have been so honored several times in the past. So I was anxious to see if his performance in this week's release of CRAZY HEART was the best he's turned in. The answer lies in personal preferences, but he did do a great job here.Bridges stars as Bad Blake, a once legendary country star who's seen better days. After years on the road, years of drinking and smoking, years of bad marriages and managers, Blake is doing the only thing he knows how. He travels on his own from town to town playing small locations to make a living. The first of which we see is a bowling alley with a bandstand.Life on the road has taken its toll on Blake. His health isn't seen as fatal when we first meet him but the excesses he's lived through seem to be catching up with him. Along with those excesses comes a certain amount of stubbornness as Blake continue to turn down attempts by his prot&eacute;g&eacute; from years back, Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), to help him by buying new songs from him. Having not written one in 3 years, Blake continues on his downward trail.And then Blake meets a young woman who comes to interview him after a show. Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has seen better days and yet goes through life with a smile on her face. A single mother, Jean is attracted to Blake and the two begin a romance that starts with one night and moves into the possibility of a more permanent arrangement.When Blake falls asleep at the wheel on his way to visit Jean, she ends up having him stay at her place until he recovers. Before leaving the hospital, Blake's doctor sets the record straight for him: he's an alcoholic, he has emphysema, the possibility of a stroke is there and if he doesn't get his life together he won't be around a lot longer.Unfortunately Blake doesn't take the doctor's advice. Once he's able, he heads home to heal. But he misses Jean and her little boy Buddy and invites them to his home. Can Blake make the changes necessary in his life to have the family that he longs for but lost so long ago? Or will his desire for drinking and a hard life rule over those dreams?The movie works well because it doesn't focus totally on the ills that Blake puts himself through. It offers us enough to realize what his problems are without having to dwell on them or on the effects that his alcoholism has on him and his life. Rather than long passages showing us what's going on in his life along these lines, we get small glimpses instead. But these are enough to make their point and allow time to show the other side of Blake as well.We get to see the side of Blake that wants to make amends for his life. We get to see the side of Blake that shows him wanting to take his life in a new direction but finding that there is no easy route to do so. And we get to see a side of Blake that through all the bluster and talk of being the big time country star, he's still a simple man at heart.Bridges characterization of Bad Blake gives a depth to the character that some would not have been able to carry off. Blake here is a man that you want to succeed, that you want to see change, that you want to find a better life. At the same time, the story doesn't move in the normal pattern where everything ends hunky dory half way through.The actors that support Bridges here also turn in great performances. Gyllenhaal offers a subtle approach to her character. She's not the doe eyed fan who is overwhelmed by the star presence of Blake. She's interested in him first as a person she's interviewing as a journalist and only later becomes romantically inclined.Collin Farrell (who I had no idea was in the film based on trailers and the like) does a great job as Tommy Sweet. The character is one that could have followed directly in the shoes of Blake, but has instead embraced the fame and fortune in an entirely different way.Both Bridges and Farrell sang themselves as the characters and it adds a nice touch. It's always better to hear the actual actors rather than see them replaced in voice over. It adds a nice touch and both actors do a commendable job here.CRAZY HEART might appear on the surface to be just another story of a musician who fell from grace or another alcoholic tries to find redemption flick. But it's more than either of those tales. It's the story of a man who has a chance to change his life for reasons he didn't know still existed inside of him.  And that makes for a great picture and a performance that is indeed Oscar worthy.",5,BRIDGES AT HIS BEST,1271721600,"04 20, 2010",2010,4620,"['One', 'true', 'good', 'things', 'happen', 'past', 'Oscar', 'night', 'was', 'see', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'win', 'best', 'actor', 'done', 'number', 'great', 'roles', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'honored', 'several', 'times', 'past', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'performance', 'week', 'release', 'CRAZY', 'HEART', 'was', 'best', 'turned', 'answer', 'personal', 'preferences', 'did', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'here.Bridges', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'once', 'legendary', 'country', 'star', 'who', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'years', 'road', 'years', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'years', 'bad', 'marriages', 'managers', 'Blake', 'doing', 'only', 'thing', 'how', 'own', 'town', 'town', 'playing', 'small', 'locations', 'make', 'living', 'first', 'see', 'bowling', 'alley', 'bandstand.Life', 'road', 'taken', 'toll', 'Blake', 'health', ""n't"", 'seen', 'fatal', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'excesses', 'lived', 'seem', 'be', 'catching', 'up', 'excesses', 'certain', 'amount', 'stubbornness', 'Blake', 'continue', 'turn', 'down', 'attempts', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'years', 'back', 'Tommy', 'Sweet', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'help', 'buying', 'new', 'songs', 'Having', 'not', 'written', 'one', '3', 'years', 'Blake', 'downward', 'trail.And', 'then', 'Blake', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'interview', 'show', 'Jean', 'Craddock', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'yet', 'life', 'smile', 'face', 'single', 'mother', 'Jean', 'attracted', 'Blake', 'two', 'begin', 'romance', 'one', 'night', 'moves', 'possibility', 'more', 'permanent', 'arrangement.When', 'Blake', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'way', 'visit', 'Jean', 'up', 'having', 'stay', 'place', 'leaving', 'hospital', 'Blake', 'doctor', 'record', 'straight', 'alcoholic', 'emphysema', 'possibility', 'stroke', 'there', ""n't"", 'get', 'life', 'together', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'lot', 'longer.Unfortunately', 'Blake', ""n't"", 'take', 'doctor', 'advice', 'able', 'home', 'heal', 'Jean', 'little', 'boy', 'Buddy', 'home', 'Can', 'Blake', 'make', 'changes', 'necessary', 'life', 'have', 'family', 'lost', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'will', 'desire', 'drinking', 'hard', 'life', 'rule', 'dreams', 'movie', 'well', ""n't"", 'focus', 'totally', 'ills', 'Blake', 'enough', 'realize', 'what', 'problems', 'are', 'having', 'dwell', 'effects', 'alcoholism', 'life', 'Rather', 'long', 'passages', 'showing', 'what', 'going', 'life', 'lines', 'get', 'small', 'glimpses', 'instead', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'point', 'allow', 'time', 'show', 'other', 'side', 'Blake', 'well.We', 'get', 'see', 'side', 'Blake', 'make', 'amends', 'life', 'get', 'see', 'side', 'Blake', 'wanting', 'take', 'life', 'new', 'direction', 'finding', 'easy', 'route', 'do', 'so', 'get', 'see', 'side', 'Blake', 'bluster', 'talk', 'being', 'big', 'time', 'country', 'star', 'still', 'simple', 'man', 'heart.Bridges', 'characterization', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'depth', 'character', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'carry', 'off', 'Blake', 'here', 'man', 'want', 'succeed', 'want', 'see', 'change', 'want', 'find', 'better', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'story', ""n't"", 'move', 'normal', 'pattern', 'where', 'everything', 'hunky', 'dory', 'half', 'way', 'through.The', 'actors', 'support', 'Bridges', 'here', 'also', 'turn', 'great', 'performances', 'Gyllenhaal', 'subtle', 'approach', 'character', 'not', 'doe', 'eyed', 'fan', 'who', 'overwhelmed', 'star', 'presence', 'Blake', 'interested', 'first', 'person', 'interviewing', 'journalist', 'only', 'later', 'romantically', 'inclined.Collin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'film', 'based', 'trailers', 'like', 'great', 'job', 'Tommy', 'Sweet', 'character', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'followed', 'directly', 'shoes', 'Blake', 'instead', 'embraced', 'fame', 'fortune', 'entirely', 'different', 'way.Both', 'Bridges', 'Farrell', 'sang', 'characters', 'nice', 'touch', 'always', 'better', 'hear', 'actual', 'actors', 'rather', 'see', 'replaced', 'voice', 'nice', 'touch', 'actors', 'do', 'commendable', 'job', 'here.CRAZY', 'HEART', 'might', 'appear', 'surface', 'be', 'just', 'story', 'musician', 'who', 'fell', 'grace', 'alcoholic', 'tries', 'find', 'redemption', 'flick', 'more', 'tales', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'chance', 'change', 'life', 'reasons', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'still', 'existed', 'great', 'picture', 'performance', 'indeed', 'Oscar', 'worthy']",Crazy Heart
1334181,AAYE34TCTNV2R,B0039UT3LK,MarlowesMom,"[0, 1]","Jeff Bridges certainly deserved his Best Actor Academy Award for his performance in ""Crazy Heart"" as Bad Blake, a once-popular country singer-songwriter who has been reduced to playing at dingy bars and bowling alleys to get enough money for a grimy motel room, gas for his truck, and the vast amounts of liquor and tobacco he consumes. Bridges gets every nuance of Bad's verbal and physical language to create a fully realized, multi-layered character without ever seeming labored or mannered or showy. (If you think he doesn't have to travel far from himself to get to Bad's character, I'd suggest you watch the ""American Masters"" profile of him on PBS.) The story of a down-and-out artist hoping for personal and professional redemption in the arms of a good woman is not exactly earthshaking in originality, but the heartfelt commitment of the cast and filmmakers lifts ""Crazy Heart"" above its flaws and cliches. There are many details about ""Crazy Heart"" that feel just right, from the look of the small desert towns to the truck Bad drives and the plastic gallon bottle he carries with him to avoid the effort of getting out of his truck to empty his bladder on the long hauls between gigs. I always appreciate a film that avoids wrapping up happily-ever-after in a box with a pink ribbon, and ""Crazy Heart"" succeeds on that count as well.Bridges gets able support from Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jean Craddock, a much-younger single mother who meets Bad interviewing him for a small-town newspaper and falls for him. Eeeeewww, you might wonder, how on earth she could fall for this stinky loser 25 years her senior. If you're the maternal, caretaker type, you probably know very well, because in spite of his obvious flaws, Bad has enough talent and charm, combined with shredded remnants of sweetness and dignity, to be very endearing to a certain kind of woman--and Jean doesn't have a history of making the best choices for herself. Robert Duvall as an old friend and mentor, and Colin Farrell as Tommy Sweet, a contemporary type of country music superstar who Bad mentored years ago and with whom Bad has strained relationship, round out the excellent cast.T-Bone Burnett is in charge of the music. As always, it's extremely well-done. I actively dislike country music, but the songs, sung by Bridges and Farrell themselves, are just right in this context.It's interesting that while his rough contemporaries DeNiro and Pacino have largely been reduced to parodies of themselves, Bridges keeps getting better and better and is finally getting the recognition he deserves. He's been making remarkable contributions to American film for decades and it's a great pleasure to see him rewarded. ""Crazy Heart"" is a real treat for grown-ups who appreciate fine acting. Not, in my opinion, suitable for children 15 and younger.",4,Lovely Performances in a Modest Film,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,2824,"['Jeff', 'Bridges', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'once-popular', 'country', 'singer-songwriter', 'who', 'been', 'reduced', 'playing', 'dingy', 'bars', 'bowling', 'alleys', 'get', 'enough', 'money', 'grimy', 'motel', 'room', 'gas', 'truck', 'vast', 'amounts', 'liquor', 'tobacco', 'Bridges', 'nuance', 'Bad', 'verbal', 'physical', 'language', 'create', 'fully', 'realized', 'multi-layered', 'character', 'ever', 'seeming', 'labored', 'mannered', 'showy', 'think', ""n't"", 'have', 'travel', 'far', 'get', 'Bad', 'character', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'watch', 'American', 'Masters', 'profile', 'PBS', 'story', 'down-and-out', 'artist', 'hoping', 'personal', 'professional', 'redemption', 'arms', 'good', 'woman', 'not', 'exactly', 'earthshaking', 'originality', 'heartfelt', 'commitment', 'cast', 'filmmakers', 'lifts', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'flaws', 'cliches', 'are', 'many', 'details', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'feel', 'just', 'right', 'look', 'small', 'desert', 'towns', 'truck', 'Bad', 'drives', 'plastic', 'gallon', 'bottle', 'avoid', 'effort', 'getting', 'truck', 'empty', 'bladder', 'long', 'hauls', 'gigs', 'always', 'appreciate', 'film', 'wrapping', 'up', 'happily-ever-after', 'box', 'pink', 'ribbon', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'count', 'well.Bridges', 'able', 'support', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jean', 'Craddock', 'much-younger', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'Bad', 'interviewing', 'small-town', 'newspaper', 'falls', 'Eeeeewww', 'might', 'wonder', 'how', 'earth', 'could', 'fall', 'stinky', '25', 'years', 'senior', ""'re"", 'maternal', 'caretaker', 'type', 'probably', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'spite', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'Bad', 'enough', 'talent', 'charm', 'combined', 'shredded', 'remnants', 'sweetness', 'dignity', 'be', 'very', 'endearing', 'certain', 'kind', 'woman', 'Jean', ""n't"", 'have', 'history', 'making', 'best', 'choices', 'herself', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'old', 'friend', 'mentor', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Tommy', 'Sweet', 'contemporary', 'type', 'country', 'music', 'superstar', 'who', 'Bad', 'mentored', 'years', 'ago', 'whom', 'Bad', 'strained', 'relationship', 'round', 'excellent', 'cast.T-Bone', 'Burnett', 'charge', 'music', 'always', 'extremely', 'well-done', 'actively', 'dislike', 'country', 'music', 'songs', 'sung', 'Bridges', 'Farrell', 'are', 'just', 'right', 'context.It', 'interesting', 'rough', 'contemporaries', 'DeNiro', 'Pacino', 'have', 'largely', 'been', 'reduced', 'parodies', 'Bridges', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'finally', 'getting', 'recognition', 'been', 'making', 'remarkable', 'contributions', 'American', 'film', 'decades', 'great', 'pleasure', 'see', 'rewarded', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'real', 'treat', 'grown-ups', 'who', 'appreciate', 'fine', 'acting', 'Not', 'opinion', 'suitable', 'children', '15', 'younger']",Crazy Heart

They are not a major part of the movie, which is good, because too much country music would probably send me running for the exits in most cases. Jeff Bridges has won all of the big awards for Best Actor heading towards the Oscars and I think he deserved every one. His performance is great, yet he makes it seem so effortless and natural. It's about time The Dude got his due. He makes Bad Blake, a once top of the charts country singer, into a really rough and sometimes disturbing character, but he injects just enough charm to make you feel and root for him by the end. His singing ain't too shabby either. I normally don't care for Maggie Gyllenhaal, but she turns in a very strong performance here and is not only believable, but likeable as well. Robert Duvall and Colin Farrell (who is hidden away in the credits for some reason) are both outstanding in small, yet important roles. As you can tell, the casting and acting prowess made Crazy Heart better than it would have otherwise been. The script is good, but this kind of story can be seen in The Wrestler, Walk the Line and many others. I do have to say that this film does feel very authentic. Even more so than Walk the Line.You can't help but get wrapped up in Crazy Heart.

1334206,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0039UT3LK,RMurray847,"[151, 159]","Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) is a country music ""star"" whose fame has dimmed down to almost nothing.  He's almost always drunk; his ""tour"" involves him driving himself and his guitar from one really small, cheap venue to another and linking up with a local band who accompany him using cheat sheets.  He is disheveled (frankly, he looks like Kris Kristofferson), and even when he showers, he looks like he's in need of a cleaning and a comb.  He's had hit songs, and his aging fans (the few who remember him) are enthusiastic about seeing him, and when he can avoid throwing up from drinking, he can still put on a charming concert and usually take some woman back with him to his hotel for some company.He has hit, quite frankly, just slightly above rock bottom.  Yet one day, he grants an interview to a Santa Fe journalist (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and sparks of mutual interest fly between the two almost immediately.  The movie then embarks on a somewhat predictable ""journey of redemption""...but it has enough things going for it to make this film rise well above the clich&eacute;s that fill the two paragraphs I've just written.Bad Blake is hardly a character we've never seen before.  But as played by Jeff Bridges, we discover something new about him at every turn.  He charms us, and actually makes it easy to see why a much younger woman like Gyllenhaal might find a place in her heart for him.  His eagerness to be a positive force in the life of this single mother is an almost palpable thing...and we also get to watch as he derails his own efforts.  To say that Bridges gives a ""lived in"" performance doesn't begin to scratch the surface.  Bridges is one of those great actors who has no vanity and no problem disappearing into his roles.  It helps that he sings the terrific songs that were written for him, so that we get a genuine sense of Blake as a performer.  We are able to see not only the worthwhile man behind the booze and dirty clothes, but the charismatic star that once was there and hasn't completely died yet.  Bridges gives, simply, the best male performance of 2009.While Bridges is clearly the single most important reason the film rises above clich&eacute;, he is certainly helped by a very nice script, with lots of wry humor and tenderness and anger and anguish.  It navigates through the clich&eacute;s, not by ignoring them, but my giving them enough specificity that they no longer feel unoriginal.The movie was filmed in New Mexico (my state...as anyone who reads my reviews knows) and the landscape perfectly compliments the tone of the movie.  If it had been set in a lusher climate, something would have been lost.  There is both the dryness and harshness of the landscape AND the welcome bursts of color...just like Blake has a harshness that is frequently belied by bursts of warmth and feeling.The movie features fine acting throughout.  Gyllenhaal is very good (although I scratch my head a bit over her Oscar nomination...I didn't think she was THAT good), Robert Duval is funny and wise in his small role, and even Colin Farrell shows up as a big country star with a complicated history with Blake.  Farrell is not entirely convincing as a country singer...but he pulls of the ""star"" attitude with ease.  I appreciate that he was willing to take this tiny role...in the last couple of years, he has gotten serious about acting again, and has done much to redeem himself in my mind (his work in IN BRUGES was great).This is a feel good movie that isn't afraid to make us feel a little bad from time to time.

1334209,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0039UT3LK,Robert Moore,"[3, 4]","CRAZY HEART is one of the finest movies that I have seen in the past year and will almost definitely win Jeff Bridges his first Oscar.  Even in a year where Bridges had strong competition, I think he would take home the award.  Over the course of forty years Bridges has been one of the most reliable actors in America, putting together a string of extraordinary performances.  He has not gained quite the star stature of a DeNiro or Pacino, despite appearing in as many interesting roles as either.  But he has one the one hand abjured the kinds of roles that would make him more of a box office sensation and on the other refused to play the same kind of role twice.  There is no ""typical"" Jeff Bridges role.  Here he plays a closed-to-burned-out country singer, an old school performer along the lines of a Waylon Jennings or Guy Clark, and he does it convincingly.  In fact, the last time I saw an actor portray an old, burned out country singer so well was Robert Duvall in TENDER MERCIES.  And as Jeff Bridges will in CRAZY HEART, Duvall an actor for Best Actor.Although the strongest thing in CRAZY HEART is Jeff Bridges's performance, it is far from the only fine thing in it.  The songs are amazing (and the film will definitely take home one or two Oscars for music) and all sound like classics you should have known from the past, but don't be cause they were written by Stephen Bruton and T-Bone Burnett, who also produced the album.  Jeff Bridges does a very credible job performing the songs, as does Colin Farrell as hot country performer Tommy Sweet.  Maggie Gyllenhaal has always been fascinating to me.  Sometimes she is amazing and is quite cute.  Other times she is bland and fairly plain looking.  But in this film she was quietly compelling in a very difficult role and was quite fetching.  Her role was difficult for the same reason that Ginger Rogers's roles with Fred Astaire were so tough.  No, it isn't the old quip about her doing the same thing that Fred did only in high hills and backwards.  Fred's dancing was on a completely different plane than Ginger's, but where she excelled was making the audience believe that she found Fred so appealing.  Now, Bad Blake (Bridges's character) is not a very sexy or appealing guy.  Well, to be honest, he is repulsive.  But Gyllenhaal makes us believe he has qualities that a woman might find appealing.  We don't see it in Bad; we see it in Gyllenhaal's face.  This is why she should also get an Oscar nomination.  The cinematography is up to the standards of the music and acting and the writing should definitely snag an Oscar nomination.This is simply a flat out great movie.  I think the Oscar can pretty much be handed over to AVATAR this year, but if there is a dark horse that might sneak in and steal it, it might well be CRAZY HEART.  This is a rare, special film that I think anyone who loves movies -- as opposed to blockbuster special effects flicks -- will adore.  I have no explanation for the two previous reviews.  I don't think either makes any sense whatsoever or will be the reaction of the vast majority of viewers.  Certainly the film is getting great, great reviews and has won a shelf full of awards, mainly for Best Actor, Best Music, and Best Song.  I think this is one of those beautiful, moving films that people will enjoy and treasure.  And it is definitely my favorite film made in 2009 (though I have not yet seen AVATAR, though I've seen all the other award contenders from the past year).

In 2008, it was Mickey Rourke who got to show off his acting chops in ""The Wrestler,"" and now it's Jeff Bridges' turn in ""Crazy Heart,"" playing a once-legendary, but now pot-bellied, whiskey-soaked country singer/songwriter - who goes by the stage name Bad Blake - who's so far past his prime that he's been reduced to performing in bowling alleys and two-bit bars just to stay financially afloat and to keep his name before the public.  But, unlike Rourke, Bridges was actually rewarded with a Best Actor Oscar for all his pains.  And, to top it off, he gets to sing too!  (Quite well, actually).Bridges certainly deserved his award for a performance that far transcends the stereotypes and clich&eacute;s that might have foiled a lesser actor, and which lifts the movie to a plane it might otherwise never have achieved without him.  The insightful, thoughtful screenplay by Scott Cooper (based on the novel by Thomas Cobb) plows some pretty familiar territory, but Bridges makes it all seem real and fresh. The same can be said for Maggie Gyllenhaal, whose role as an attractive single-mother and local writer who becomes romantically involved with Blake after she pens a story on him could easily have become stale and trite.  Instead, these two fine actors play off one another so effectively that we forget we've seen this setup umpteen times before.  The relationship between the two uncovers many truths about a man who's so enslaved to the bottle that he has never really grown up into a fully functioning, responsible adult - and his growing awareness that it may be high time he took some concrete steps towards rectifying that situation.Another interesting, though less fully developed, relationship in the movie is the one between Blake and Tommy Sweet, a hot young singer (superbly played by Colin Farrell, who does his own performing as well) who, although he originally started as Blake's prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, now enjoys the celebrity status and critical acclaim that once were Blake's for the taking.As directed by Cooper, the movie nicely captures the look and feel of both the dusty Southwest countryside in which it's set and the seedy bars and cheap motel rooms where a good deal of the indoor action takes place.With its world-class performances (throw Robert Duvall into that mix), intelligent writing and sensitive direction, ""Crazy Heart"" has all the down-home wisdom and blues-driven heartache of a good ole country tune.",4,Fine performances and filmmaking refresh an oft-told story,1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,2684,"['few', 'years', 'so', 'aging', 'male', 'star', 'will', 'take', 'role', 'broken-down', 'has-been', 'remind', 'just', 'how', 'fine', 'actor', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'given', 'material', ""n't"", 'rely', 'youth', 'good', 'looks', 'get', 'job', 'done', '2008', 'was', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'got', 'show', 'off', 'acting', 'chops', 'Wrestler', 'now', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'turn', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'playing', 'once-legendary', 'now', 'pot-bellied', 'whiskey-soaked', 'country', 'singer/songwriter', 'who', 'stage', 'name', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'who', 'so', 'far', 'prime', 'been', 'reduced', 'performing', 'bowling', 'alleys', 'two-bit', 'bars', 'just', 'stay', 'financially', 'afloat', 'keep', 'name', 'public', 'Rourke', 'Bridges', 'was', 'actually', 'rewarded', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'pains', 'top', 'off', 'sing', 'too', 'Quite', 'well', 'actually', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'award', 'performance', 'far', 'stereotypes', 'clich', 'eacute', 'might', 'have', 'foiled', 'lesser', 'actor', 'movie', 'plane', 'might', 'otherwise', 'never', 'have', 'achieved', 'insightful', 'thoughtful', 'screenplay', 'Scott', 'Cooper', 'based', 'novel', 'Thomas', 'Cobb', 'pretty', 'familiar', 'territory', 'Bridges', 'seem', 'real', 'fresh', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'role', 'attractive', 'single-mother', 'local', 'writer', 'who', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Blake', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'become', 'stale', 'trite', 'Instead', 'two', 'fine', 'actors', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'so', 'effectively', 'forget', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'setup', 'umpteen', 'times', 'relationship', 'two', 'uncovers', 'many', 'truths', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'enslaved', 'bottle', 'never', 'really', 'grown', 'up', 'fully', 'functioning', 'responsible', 'adult', 'growing', 'awareness', 'may', 'be', 'high', 'time', 'took', 'concrete', 'steps', 'towards', 'rectifying', 'situation.Another', 'interesting', 'though', 'less', 'fully', 'developed', 'relationship', 'movie', 'one', 'Blake', 'Tommy', 'Sweet', 'hot', 'young', 'singer', 'superbly', 'played', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'own', 'performing', 'well', 'who', 'originally', 'started', 'Blake', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'now', 'celebrity', 'status', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'once', 'were', 'Blake', 'taking.As', 'directed', 'Cooper', 'movie', 'nicely', 'look', 'feel', 'dusty', 'Southwest', 'countryside', 'set', 'seedy', 'bars', 'cheap', 'motel', 'rooms', 'where', 'good', 'deal', 'indoor', 'action', 'world-class', 'performances', 'throw', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'mix', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'sensitive', 'direction', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'down-home', 'wisdom', 'blues-driven', 'heartache', 'good', 'ole', 'country', 'tune']",Crazy Heart

1334214,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0039UT3LK,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 3]","True to its subject, ""Crazy Heart"" has many of the charms - and flaws - of a popular country music ballad: Sweet, thoughtful, a little vague and clich&eacute;d, but gently reassuring. Already compared to ""The Wrestler"" and ""Tender Mercies,"" it lacks the screenplay and depth of those great movies, but Jeff Bridges, as country crooner Bad Blake, is great nonetheless. He earned his Academy Award years ago, really, but he finally won an Best Actor Oscar for ""Crazy Heart,"" and his performance is worthy of the statue. He's a passable singer, too.As Scott Cooper's directorial debut opens, Bad's on the back end of a tour through the Southwest, dive bars and bowling alleys, when he meets Jane (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a journalist who's wiser about Blake's music than she is, clearly, about journalism. He offers her a bite of his steak from a takeout carton. She asks a few questions he doesn't particularly want to answer, especially one about new country star Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), whom Bad once mentored. There's a chemistry between Bad and Jane, a single mom whose motivations are unclear (and never get much clearer) for pursuing a man old enough to be her father. But pursue him she does.Bad is a drunk, which complicates his thing with Jane and appears to have nearly severed his friendship with Tommy, played in a low, pleasant key by Farrell. Bad imagines himself a functioning alcoholic, but there's a truck accident one week, a puke session on stage the next and, later, a trip to the mall with Jane's son that turns into a crisis. An old bartender friend (Robert Duvall) knows a rehab place. Bad isn't sure he wants to go. Bridges wisely underplays Bad as a man so accustomed to being a total wreck that he musters a smile through the pain.  It helps that, when Bad emerges from the booze fog for a few days, he can still write one hell of a song.""Crazy Heart,"" bound for video before Bridges' performance started getting Oscar mentions, never pushes too hard, loving its characters more than it's willing to examine them. The ending is so pat and generous it becomes pap. A bit actor for a decade before adapting and directing Thomas Cobb's 1987 novel for the screen, Cooper gives his talented cast a wide berth, and they paper over some - though not all - of the screenplay's gaps with their skills.As written, Jane is a clich&eacute;d Good Woman with Bad Taste - who lives in a stylish home far too nice for a journalist's salary - but Gyllenhaal pads the role with her trademark warmth and good cheer; few actors can tease and smile and laugh as naturally as she does.

Naimpally ""avid music and movie fan""","[1, 1]","This movie had terrific acting but after seeing the movie, I wished the story had explored the characters in more depth.  Jeff Bridges plays a once famous country singer/songwriter whose career has declined to where he is playing bowling alleys in small towns to make a living.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a reporter who becomes romantically involved with him.  Collin Ferrell plays a young protege of Bridges who is hugely popular and who wants to help out his mentor.The main problem I had with this movie was that we don't find out very much about Bridge' character, particular since he is such an interesting character.  Gyllenshaal plays a reporter who is a single mom who wants to write a story about the singer.  This would have been a great mechanism to find out out more about his character.  How did he become so successful?  Why did his career decline?  When/why did he become an alcoholic, i.e. did his career decline because he became an alcoholic or did he become an alcoholic because his career declined?  We find out that he had a son, who is now an adult, but has never spoken to him, though he lives in the same city.  Why did he never contact his ex-wife?  Why did he never contact his son?  Why does he suddenly feel the need to try to contact him?  What was the relationship between Bridges and Ferrell, and how did Bridges' career decline while Ferrell's took off?  Why is Bridges such a a good songwriter?  There were so many of these character traits that could have been explored further but sadly, the script explores none of these.If it weren't for the stellar cast, this would have been a fairly pedestrian film because the script is quite shallow in its treatment of Bridges's character.",4,Great acting but could have been much better with a better story,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,1713,"['movie', 'had', 'terrific', 'acting', 'seeing', 'movie', 'wished', 'story', 'had', 'explored', 'characters', 'more', 'depth', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'once', 'famous', 'country', 'singer/songwriter', 'career', 'declined', 'where', 'playing', 'bowling', 'alleys', 'small', 'towns', 'make', 'living', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'reporter', 'who', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Collin', 'Ferrell', 'young', 'protege', 'Bridges', 'who', 'hugely', 'popular', 'who', 'help', 'out', 'mentor.The', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'very', 'much', 'Bridge', 'character', 'particular', 'such', 'interesting', 'character', 'Gyllenshaal', 'reporter', 'who', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'write', 'story', 'singer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'mechanism', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'character', 'How', 'did', 'become', 'so', 'successful', 'Why', 'did', 'career', 'decline', 'When/why', 'did', 'become', 'alcoholic', 'i.e', 'did', 'career', 'decline', 'became', 'alcoholic', 'did', 'become', 'alcoholic', 'career', 'declined', 'find', 'out', 'had', 'son', 'who', 'now', 'adult', 'never', 'spoken', 'same', 'city', 'Why', 'did', 'never', 'contact', 'ex-wife', 'Why', 'did', 'never', 'contact', 'son', 'Why', 'suddenly', 'feel', 'need', 'try', 'contact', 'What', 'was', 'relationship', 'Bridges', 'Ferrell', 'how', 'did', 'Bridges', 'career', 'decline', 'Ferrell', 'took', 'off', 'Why', 'Bridges', 'good', 'songwriter', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'character', 'traits', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'further', 'sadly', 'script', 'none', 'these.If', 'were', ""n't"", 'stellar', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'pedestrian', 'film', 'script', 'quite', 'shallow', 'treatment', 'Bridges', 'character']",Crazy Heart

It has the perfect blend of amazing performances, great storyline and an awesome soundtrack. This follows Bad Blake who is an old, alcoholic country singer who has seen better times. He struggles to make ends meet and is tired and jaded by his life on the road. That is until he meets Jean (a newspaper reporter writing an article about him) and her son, Buddy, who give him something to love for. The first thing I noticed is that this film has plenty of wide open countryside scenes as Bad drives from gig to gig and the wide camera shots are truly stunning. It is sad at the start to see Bad so jaded by his life and yet his fans still obviously adore him; it lends the film a certain melancholy air from early on. In fact, this film has a gentle, slightly sad, but heartfelt feel the whole way through and Bad's relationship with Jean and Buddy really is lovely and heart warming to watch. Like I mentioned, the performances are incredible and Bridges plays the grizzled, aged country musician perfectly and the Oscar he won for this role was more than deserved. The soundtrack is a real delight in this film and turns this from a good film into a great one, the guitars and country lyrics suit this film to a tee. This isn't an all action film (thankfully), but a simple story, that is extremely well made, about one mans life, his perseverance and how he finds some meaning after years of self abuse and personal tribulation.

1334219,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B0039UT3LK,Steve,"[2, 5]","Crazy Heart won't win awards for originality, but then again, country music is nothing if not completely derivative and clich&eacute;-ridden so why shouldn't a movie about a country singer be as well? It is not an unpleasant movie, but the problem is that the strong parts are equally countered by the weak ones and I walked away from this feeling fairly empty. I kept waiting for this movie to buck the many stereotypes it carries, but sadly it never does.All of that said, however, Bridges does his best as Bad Blake (a role he reprises for ""True Grit,"" btw...) but it's often a two-dimensional role. That's the problem with Crazy Heart - it lacks the depth of character and the unpredictable nature of humanity to work as well as it might have. The gangs all here: the cute kid, the wise old friend, the sleazy agent, the hard luck woman, and the drunken country singer. All that's missing is the hooker with a heart of gold and the evil villain. Furthermore, it is burdened by too many gaps in credibility; chief among them - the attraction between Gyllenhaal's Jane and Bridge's Blake, and the seeming overnight cessation of not one but two addictions. If you want to throw in Colin Farrell as a country singer, that works for me, too. The romance irked me the most because there are scores of actresses who would've made this role so much more. Nothing to take away from Gyllenhaal, but she's far too young and not nearly rough-edged enough to work in this role. It is a classic example of Hollywood's inability to portray honest age-appropriate relationships. For the record, there are nearly three decades that separate the two.In short, Crazy Heart is a movie with good performances and whiskey-soaked songs but light on originality, reality, and plot. In the end, you might just be better off buying the soundtrack.",3,A mixed bag,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,1825,"['Crazy', 'Heart', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'originality', 'then', 'again', 'country', 'music', 'nothing', 'not', 'completely', 'derivative', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'so', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'movie', 'country', 'singer', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'unpleasant', 'movie', 'problem', 'strong', 'parts', 'are', 'equally', 'countered', 'weak', 'ones', 'walked', 'away', 'feeling', 'fairly', 'empty', 'kept', 'waiting', 'movie', 'buck', 'many', 'stereotypes', 'sadly', 'never', 'does.All', 'said', 'however', 'Bridges', 'best', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'role', 'True', 'Grit', 'btw', 'often', 'two-dimensional', 'role', 'problem', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'depth', 'character', 'unpredictable', 'nature', 'humanity', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'have', 'gangs', 'here', 'cute', 'kid', 'wise', 'old', 'friend', 'sleazy', 'agent', 'hard', 'luck', 'woman', 'drunken', 'country', 'singer', 'missing', 'hooker', 'heart', 'gold', 'evil', 'villain', 'Furthermore', 'burdened', 'too', 'many', 'gaps', 'credibility', 'chief', 'attraction', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jane', 'Bridge', 'Blake', 'seeming', 'overnight', 'cessation', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'addictions', 'want', 'throw', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'country', 'singer', 'too', 'romance', 'irked', 'most', 'are', 'scores', 'actresses', 'who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'role', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Nothing', 'take', 'away', 'Gyllenhaal', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'not', 'nearly', 'rough-edged', 'enough', 'work', 'role', 'classic', 'example', 'Hollywood', 'inability', 'portray', 'honest', 'age-appropriate', 'relationships', 'record', 'are', 'nearly', 'three', 'decades', 'separate', 'two.In', 'short', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'movie', 'good', 'performances', 'whiskey-soaked', 'songs', 'light', 'originality', 'reality', 'plot', 'end', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'buying', 'soundtrack']",Crazy Heart

The story is not unlike that of ""Tender Mercies"", another ""small"" film, starring Robert Duvall (who has a small part in Crazy Heart as well as being one of the producers) about 20 years ago. T-Bone Burnett is now the ""go to"" guy for music tracks and he does another superb job here (and won an Oscar too!).So, this is definitely a FIBE STAR movie. The DVD is only four stars though because of the skimpy extras. While I'd love to hear Bridges, or even better Burnett, do a commentary, there is none. Beside the Theatrical Trailer (do we really need that?) there are six deleted scenes (totally 10 minutes). Most are short and useless. The longest - ay three-minutes-plus is a scene of Bad Blake (Bridges' character) ""falling off the wagon"" (with a actress who gets listed at the end, because all her screen time was left on the cutting room floor.). The only reasonably deleted scene features a minute or more of a new song. Though many songs are sung completely in the film, others weren't.

1334227,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0039UT3LK,Turfseer,"[2, 4]","***This review may contain spoilers***--In an Oscar worthy performance, Jeff Bridges is 'Bad Blake', a down on his luck, washed up country singer who is addicted to the demon alcohol. What I like about the screenwriter's characterization of Bad Blake, is that he's someone who still likes himself despite all the reversals he's had in his life. It's precisely this portrait of an aging former country star who 'sticks to his guns' that makes the character believable and prevents the story from descending into bathos.When we first meet Bad Blake, he's just arrived in his beat up '78 Suburban for a gig at a bowling alley somewhere in a small town in the mid west. When he plays and sings before the appreciative audience, it appears that he's just going through the motions--toward the end of his set, he walks off the stage and lets the hired band play, while he hits the bottle backstage. And when he returns, he only plays for one minute and calls it a night. After returning to his motel, he continues his downward spiral by drinking himself into a stupor.His next gig is in another small town at a bar. There he meets a talented piano player who asks him if he would allow an interview with his niece, Jean, a local reporter, smartly played by Maggie Guyllenhaal. Blake is guarded during his interview with Jean and won't talk about his former country music partner, Tommy Sweet, who soon appears prominently in the story. Before you know it, Blake finds himself in bed with Jean and a relationship develops. Some critics and internet posters cannot believe that a younger, good-looking woman would fall for an washed-up alcohol like Bad Blake. In the novel the movie is based on, the woman is closer to Blake in age. Yes, it might be a stretch to believe that a younger woman would fall for a character such as Bad Blake, but it's still possible--especially if the woman in question is emotionally needy and has had a pattern for falling for self-destructive types (she even admits this later when she breaks up with Blake).Soon Blake hears from his tough but caring manager (very convincingly played by James Keane) that he's arranged a gig for Blake to play on the under card of Tommy Sweet's big concert which will have over 10,000 people in attendance. Sweet, a younger former prot&eacute;g&eacute;, has eclipsed Blake and now boasts a huge following on the country music circuit. Blake decides to swallow his pride and accepts the gig since he needs the money. When we first meet Sweet, he's greeting Blake in the parking lot before the concert. Colin Farrell does a fine job in portraying the thoughtful Sweet who wants to help Blake by offering to record some of Blake's new songs if he only gets around to composing them. At this point, Blake turns Sweet down since he indicates that his muse had dried up. Nonetheless, both Blake and Sweet put on a rousing show before enthralled fans (Bridges and Farrell, under the tutelage of a vocal coach, do a fine job in doing their own singing on the soundtrack).At the midpoint one wonders where the story is going and two major events occur that keep things moving nicely forward. In both cases, Blake's alcoholism puts him in jeopardy. In the first event, Blake is almost killed when he nods off at the wheel and his Suburban rolls over into a ditch off the highway. In the second event (where the stakes are significantly raised), Blake loses Jean's four year old as he takes a few drinks at a bar at a local mall. Security guards at the mall eventually locate the boy but Jean is infuriated and breaks up with Blake on the spot.It's this horrendous event that convinces Blake that he needs to get himself in rehab. Helped by his friend, a local bar owner (ably played by the always dependable Robert Duvall), Blake weans himself off the bottle. He thinks this is enough for Jean to forgive him, but she makes it clear she doesn't want to see him again.Jean's rejection finally brings Blake completely down to reality. Now he really cleans himself up (physically and spiritually) and begins writing music again. He even takes time to try and contact his son who he hasn't seen in years (sadly, the son wants nothing to do with him).Before you know it, Tommy Sweet has recorded one of Blake's hits and it's become a #1 smash. Sweet hands Blake a big royalty check and it appears he's now back in the money and rehabilitated himself. Blake faces one last hurdle when he runs into Jean at Sweet's concert. She's now married and forgives Blake for what happened with her son. We fade out as Blake grants Jean a new interview.Jeff Bridges does an excellent job of playing the talented but troubled alcoholic. He's probably a shoo-in for this year's Oscar. In fact, all the performances in Crazy Heart are uniformly excellent and they prevent the story from becoming predictable and clich&eacute;d. Crazy Heart does suffer from slow pacing at times (some of the 'bonding' scenes between Blake and Jean's four year old go on for a little too long) but all in all, there are enough twists and turns in the plot to hold your interest to the end. Crazy Heart is one of the stronger entries in this year's crowded field of indie entries for best picture.",4,Bridges' Oscar worthy performance highlights engaging portrait of aging country singer's

However, not only did I enjoy it, I became a fan of country music.  Jeff Bridges gives a poignant, interesting, believable performance of aging, alchoholic country music star, Bad Blake, whose career is on the downswing.  However, it was mostly derivative of some many similar movies (most recently, ""The Wrestler""), and this one had a disappointingly ending like pop gun going off.  I wanted to cry at the end (perhaps he should have met his long lost son?), but instead I was merely satisfied.

1334234,AH64XXZBL1T6Z,B0039UT3LK,Yaakov (James) Mosher,"[1, 2]","""Crazy Heart"" is painful yet admirable for its realism. At several points the film is given opportunities of ""going Hollywood."" It eschews that at every turn - bravo!The relationship between country singer Bad Blake (played by Jeff Bridges) and photojournalist/single mom Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is another case for proving the fact of all facts known as Mach's Principle. Formulated by the great Austrian physicist/philosopher Ernst Mach (most famous for his sound barrier work) to explain relationships in physical science the principle spills over on to all reality (as Mach knew it would). It goes like this - at each moment of time every body in the universe stands in some definite relation to every other body. This explains why there's no ""Hollywood"" ending for Bad and Jean.The realism of ""Crazy Heart"" shows wisdom in not looking for THE cause of Bad Blake's character. Is Bad a lazy drunk and wayward father because (just using examples here) his mother died, his father beat him, or because he's an entertainer? It could be all of these things or none of them. We're spared the psychologizing and that's refreshing.Bad and Jean are what they are right now. S--t happens and what we make of it fashions who we are. Yet our character is always moving around if just in subtle ways. The uniqueness of our experiences and reactions to them forms a natural impediment to intimacy. An Oscar to ""Crazy Heart"" for identifying this.Robert Duvall provides a strong accent to the film. The relationship between Duvall's tavern owner and Bad shows us the importance of friends. The merry-go-round, impersonal quality of waning American capitalism is given testament when Wayne (Duvall) humorously forgets the name of his business partner. Also, Duvall's singing is not to be missed. This and several country hits (some sung by Bridges) including Waylon Jennings' ""Don't Think Hank (Williams) Done It This A Way"" makes the soundtrack worthy of purchase.The most hopeful part of ""Crazy Heart"" maintains realism. A near tragedy kicks Bad onto a moral and creative upswing at movie's end. The knowledge that Jean is going in a different direction makes us wonder - will Bad fall again? The coming growth of loneliness inclines us to believe ""yes"" while Bad's survival instincts makes lean toward ""no."" The ambivalent realism of ""Crazy Heart"" likely means the answer will be ""both.""",5,Real to real.,1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,2378,"['Crazy', 'Heart', 'painful', 'yet', 'admirable', 'realism', 'several', 'points', 'film', 'given', 'opportunities', 'going', 'Hollywood', 'turn', 'bravo', 'relationship', 'country', 'singer', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'photojournalist/single', 'mom', 'Jean', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'case', 'proving', 'fact', 'facts', 'known', 'Mach', 'Principle', 'Formulated', 'great', 'Austrian', 'physicist/philosopher', 'Ernst', 'Mach', 'most', 'famous', 'sound', 'barrier', 'work', 'explain', 'relationships', 'physical', 'science', 'principle', 'over', 'reality', 'Mach', 'knew', 'would', 'moment', 'time', 'body', 'universe', 'stands', 'definite', 'relation', 'other', 'body', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'Bad', 'Jean.The', 'realism', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'wisdom', 'not', 'looking', 'THE', 'cause', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'character', 'Bad', 'lazy', 'drunk', 'wayward', 'father', 'just', 'using', 'examples', 'here', 'mother', 'died', 'father', 'beat', 'entertainer', 'could', 'be', 'things', 'none', ""'re"", 'spared', 'psychologizing', 'refreshing.Bad', 'Jean', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'right', 'now', 'S', 't', 'happens', 'what', 'make', 'fashions', 'who', 'are', 'character', 'always', 'moving', 'around', 'just', 'subtle', 'ways', 'uniqueness', 'experiences', 'reactions', 'forms', 'natural', 'impediment', 'intimacy', 'Oscar', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'identifying', 'this.Robert', 'Duvall', 'strong', 'accent', 'film', 'relationship', 'Duvall', 'tavern', 'owner', 'Bad', 'importance', 'friends', 'merry-go-round', 'impersonal', 'quality', 'waning', 'American', 'capitalism', 'given', 'testament', 'when', 'Wayne', 'Duvall', 'humorously', 'name', 'business', 'partner', 'Also', 'Duvall', 'singing', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'several', 'country', 'hits', 'sung', 'Bridges', 'including', 'Waylon', 'Jennings', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Think', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'Way', 'soundtrack', 'worthy', 'purchase.The', 'most', 'hopeful', 'part', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'realism', 'near', 'tragedy', 'kicks', 'Bad', 'moral', 'creative', 'upswing', 'movie', 'end', 'knowledge', 'Jean', 'going', 'different', 'direction', 'wonder', 'will', 'Bad', 'fall', 'again', 'coming', 'growth', 'loneliness', 'inclines', 'believe', 'yes', 'Bad', 'survival', 'instincts', 'lean', 'ambivalent', 'realism', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'likely', 'answer', 'will', 'be']",Crazy Heart
