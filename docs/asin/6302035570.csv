Having first seen it during its initial release in the early '70s, I had not seen it for 25 years. Upon tracking it down, and outbidding some other eager fans of the flick, I anxiously awaited its delivery. It did not disappoint. It had that weird aura about it which complemented the subject matter of the film: Reincarnation, obviously. The cinematography, musical score, and quality acting set this film apart and make it worth owning. It definitely captures a very unique style which you don't ordinarily see with today's films. If you like movies that will make you think about them long after you've seen them, then Reincarnation of Peter Proud is a good choice.

He secretly keeps a diary of them to validate the frequency and his memory of them.  The first dream the audience sees is a naked man swimming at night towards a little boat Margot Kidder is in.  he apologizes for the fight they had earlier.  Suddenly she hits him in the privates with the boat oar and he drowns.  This man looks nothing like Peter Proud, but Peter's nightmares become more erratic and strange.  His lady friend played by Cornelia Sharpe becomes concerned.  He decides to seek professional help tp talk to someone more openly about it.  I will not say anymore about the plot.  The beginning of this film is probably something we can all relate to at some time of our life.  Debralee Scott and Jennifer O'Neill are also in this film.

292195,A3160YSU1KRL8E,6302035570,Justin Playfair,"[64, 66]","I saw this film in the mid-seventies at a West Chester University campus film event. I was impressed immediately with the subject matter (Reincarnation) and spent the time riveted to my seat until it was over. As others have stated, you will not forget it once you see it. The reason that it has such power is that it focuses on what all of us would like to do, and that is discover who we were before! The film is about a man who consistently has dreams about living a previous life in the recent past. He discovers that his dreams have a basis in reality when he recognizes the town of his dreams presented in a documentary on television. A search begins and Peter Proud tracks down all the dream clues, discovers his previous identity, and the film builds in excitement as we know that he was a murder victim in the previous life. Eventually he locates his old home and finds out that his family is still around. He uses a clever way to introduce himself to his old family and several strange psychic-like feelings and habits of saying things, tapping on glasses, etc. begin to arouse the suspicion of the former wife that her husband has come back to haunt her due to her guilt or that Dr. Proud is up to some bid for blackmail because of what he knows. In an amazing scene, his ancestral mother in a nursing home spiritually recognizes her son in the embodiment of Peter Proud and the daughter chalks it up to dementia. Proud becomes romantically involved with his daughter and drives the former wife to re-commit the actions of murder again in the spirit of Deja Vu in a great climax to the film. The most interesting aspects of this film are Springfield Mass. scenery, a 1937 Cord convertible with hide-away headlights, the amount of women sexually involved with the character and the overall angles in the filming that promote the mysterious aspects of this work.

292197,A34ITGHLD3W0ZS,6302035570,M. DONERIAN,"[18, 21]","Back in the summer of 1974, they were advertising in the Springfield Newspapers the fact that this movie would be shot in this locale.They were looking for ""stand-ins"" for Jennifer O'Neill & Michael Sarazzin, and did a small write up in the Springfield papers.It was very exciting and I saw the movie for the first time at the cinemas at Eastfield Mall, in Springfield Mass.I remember the movie was rated ""R"", and i was 19 at the time. I brought two younger friends with me, and was their ""guardian""!!!Anyway it was exciting to see parts of Springfield, Longmeadow, and Holyoke Mass filmed for this. Here are some little bits & pieces of information that may interest you all........The main bridge you see is the ""Memorial Bridge"" that goes between Springfield & West Springfield Mass. They recently did a huge reconstruction of that bridge and finally finished in the past 4-5 years!!! It looks fabulous~~The bridge that Peter Proud & girlfriend stop on is the Route 5 bridge~~ still looks exactly the same as it did~~ only i laugh because you couldn't stop where they stopped to look at the memorial bridge for a million dollars~~ They speed like demons around there, because there are several ramps where traffic meets to go over the Route 5 bridge~~That's Hollywood!!!!That Pilgrim statue that they keep showing is over at the Springfield Library & Quadrangle over on State Street. The Chestnut street apartment tower is right near there. At the time that was filmed, the Chestnut tower was still in construction and still stands completed today~~One night, or on several nights, my girlfriend Colleen and i would drive in her car looking for the house that has that erie little stained glass window~~~ Well, one night, WE FOUND IT!!!!I can't remember the street name, but it's in the section I onced lived in when i was four~~~ There are a bunch of College named Streets in the area between Bay Street, and Saint James Avenue. I know because i lived on Amherst Street. I went back to that area with a friend who also grew up there about 11 years ago, and it still is kind of spooky out there~~ The house was gold at the time, and that little octagonal window was lit, just like the movie!!! The couple who owned that house had still owned it in the mid-1990's, not sure of ownership now. But that area is lovely~~ filled with Victorian houses. It was magic!!!All i can say is one night, get in your car, play ""Tubular Bells"" by Mike Oldfield on your car CD or tape player, and hit all the side streets off of those streets that are named after colleges. You will be pleasantly and spookily surprised!!!",5,The Reincarnation of Springfield & Holyoke Massachusetts,1091836800,"08 7, 2004",2004,2608,"['Back', 'summer', '1974', 'were', 'advertising', 'Springfield', 'Newspapers', 'fact', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'shot', 'locale.They', 'were', 'looking', 'stand-ins', 'Jennifer', ""O'Neill"", 'Michael', 'Sarazzin', 'did', 'small', 'write', 'up', 'Springfield', 'papers.It', 'was', 'very', 'exciting', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'cinemas', 'Eastfield', 'Mall', 'Springfield', 'Mass.I', 'remember', 'movie', 'was', 'rated', 'R', 'i', 'was', '19', 'time', 'brought', 'two', 'younger', 'friends', 'was', 'guardian', 'was', 'exciting', 'see', 'parts', 'Springfield', 'Longmeadow', 'Holyoke', 'Mass', 'filmed', 'Here', 'are', 'little', 'bits', 'pieces', 'information', 'may', 'interest', 'main', 'bridge', 'see', 'Memorial', 'Bridge', 'Springfield', 'West', 'Springfield', 'Mass', 'recently', 'did', 'huge', 'reconstruction', 'bridge', 'finally', 'finished', 'past', '4-5', 'years', 'fabulous~~The', 'bridge', 'Peter', 'Proud', 'girlfriend', 'stop', 'Route', '5', 'bridge~~', 'still', 'exactly', 'same', 'only', 'i', 'laugh', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'where', 'stopped', 'look', 'memorial', 'bridge', 'million', 'dollars~~', 'speed', 'demons', 'there', 'are', 'several', 'ramps', 'where', 'traffic', 'meets', 'go', 'Route', '5', 'bridge~~That', 'Hollywood', 'Pilgrim', 'statue', 'keep', 'showing', 'Springfield', 'Library', 'Quadrangle', 'State', 'Street', 'Chestnut', 'street', 'apartment', 'tower', 'right', 'there', 'time', 'was', 'filmed', 'Chestnut', 'tower', 'was', 'still', 'construction', 'still', 'completed', 'today~~One', 'night', 'several', 'nights', 'girlfriend', 'Colleen', 'i', 'would', 'drive', 'car', 'looking', 'house', 'erie', 'little', 'stained', 'glass', 'window~~~', 'Well', 'one', 'night', 'WE', 'FOUND', 'IT', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'street', 'name', 'section', 'onced', 'lived', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'four~~~', 'are', 'bunch', 'College', 'named', 'Streets', 'area', 'Bay', 'Street', 'Saint', 'James', 'Avenue', 'know', 'i', 'lived', 'Amherst', 'Street', 'went', 'back', 'area', 'friend', 'who', 'also', 'grew', 'up', 'there', '11', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'kind', 'spooky', 'house', 'was', 'gold', 'time', 'little', 'octagonal', 'window', 'was', 'lit', 'just', 'movie', 'couple', 'who', 'owned', 'house', 'had', 'still', 'owned', 'mid-1990', 'not', 'sure', 'ownership', 'now', 'area', 'lovely~~', 'filled', 'Victorian', 'houses', 'was', 'magic', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'night', 'get', 'car', 'play', 'Tubular', 'Bells', 'Mike', 'Oldfield', 'car', 'CD', 'tape', 'player', 'hit', 'side', 'streets', 'streets', 'are', 'named', 'colleges', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'spookily', 'surprised']",The Reincarnation of Peter Proud VHS

292208,AYYOPF6RG019D,6302035570,The Mechanic,"[14, 15]","This is a fantastic mid 70s (not early 70s as other reviewers have written) thriller that still has not been put on DVD.  Please read the other reviews for a film synopsis.  Thanks to those reviewers who shared their familiarity with the film's locations.  For me, I love 70s movies, and this movie is a great example of why.  The filmstock provides a perfect dark coating to add to the creepiness of a man obsessed with finding out why he was murdered in a previous life.  As one reviewer noted, there is a definite sexual undercurrent to the film.  This is not a movie for kids.  'The Reincarnation of Peter Proud' explores the idea of reincarnation in an intelligent way while keeping the viewer interested in what happens to the characters.  The acting is top notch, and though there are some holes here and there, I found that they did not detract from my appreciation for this movie.  I like the way Sarrazin abandons everything in his present life to pursue the woman who WAS HIS DAUGHTER in that previous life.  Also, the movie has a fated quality to it, which (I believe) has an intoxicating affect on the viewer.  See this movie, and contact the studio and urge them to put it on DVD, ASAP.  It's that good.  Also, if you like the dark, gloomy feel of this movie, and the soundtrack music is largely responsible for that, I recommend you buy October Rust and Bloody Kisses by a band called Type O Negative.  They are (sort of) a combination of Black Sabbath and The Doors:  slow, heavy, dark, gloomy, with the type of thick vibe that bands today almost NEVER have.  Their music is a world unto itself.  It stands apart from trends, radio, etc. and has a medieval feel to a lot of it, without sacrificing melody or punch.  They are THE BEST BAND you've never heard of--",5,"Put this on DVD, NOW!!!",1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,1778,"['fantastic', 'mid', '70s', 'not', 'early', '70s', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'thriller', 'still', 'not', 'been', 'put', 'DVD', 'Please', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'synopsis', 'Thanks', 'reviewers', 'who', 'shared', 'familiarity', 'film', 'locations', 'love', '70s', 'movies', 'movie', 'great', 'example', 'why', 'filmstock', 'perfect', 'dark', 'coating', 'add', 'creepiness', 'man', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'out', 'why', 'was', 'murdered', 'previous', 'life', 'one', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'definite', 'sexual', 'undercurrent', 'film', 'not', 'movie', 'kids', ""'The"", 'Reincarnation', 'Peter', 'Proud', 'idea', 'reincarnation', 'intelligent', 'way', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'interested', 'what', 'characters', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'are', 'holes', 'here', 'there', 'found', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'appreciation', 'movie', 'way', 'Sarrazin', 'abandons', 'everything', 'present', 'life', 'pursue', 'woman', 'who', 'WAS', 'HIS', 'DAUGHTER', 'previous', 'life', 'Also', 'movie', 'fated', 'quality', 'believe', 'intoxicating', 'affect', 'viewer', 'See', 'movie', 'contact', 'studio', 'urge', 'put', 'DVD', 'ASAP', 'good', 'Also', 'like', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'feel', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'largely', 'responsible', 'recommend', 'buy', 'October', 'Rust', 'Bloody', 'Kisses', 'band', 'called', 'Type', 'O', 'Negative', 'are', 'sort', 'combination', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'Doors', 'slow', 'heavy', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'type', 'thick', 'vibe', 'today', 'almost', 'NEVER', 'have', 'music', 'world', 'apart', 'trends', 'radio', 'etc', 'medieval', 'feel', 'lot', 'sacrificing', 'melody', 'punch', 'are', 'BEST', 'BAND', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard']",The Reincarnation of Peter Proud VHS
