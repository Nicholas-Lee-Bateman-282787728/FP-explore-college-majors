405764,A2582KMXLK2P06,6304177259,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","The Last Supper is a pretty funny dark comedy.  It's about a group of grad students that invite people over to their homes to have late night discussion groups around the dinner table.  They cover all the important subjects such as sex and war.  When one unstable and untrustworthy man comes over and basically compliments H*tler and supports everything that any sensible person would never support in a million zillion years, the grad students obviously take exception to this.Soon after, the man grabs one of the grad students and holds a knife up to his throat.  It's obvious that the man is crazy so the other grad students stab him in the back resulting in the man falling over and dying.  The students begin to panic and worry with the normal questions you'd expect after someone just commits a murder. ""What do we do!  We need to call the cops!"" but instead, since the man was apparently a truck driver, they believe nobody will suspect a thing.From here, the grad students basically get off on killing the people they invite over for their thought-provoking discussions, and come up with this idea to provide them with poisonous wine.  When a preacher comes over and basically says that man on man action is wrong and that these men should all be shipped to a deserted island where they will eventually die off, this becomes the first of many killings a result of the grad students believing these are bad, hateful people that will only end up having a negative impact on the world.  More like a humongous overraction, but okay!These grad students constantly come up with hypothetical questions such as ""It's Austria, 1909, and you have the opportunity to kill H*tler.  Would you do it knowing what he was going to do?""  Of course the answer here is, only unless we're 100% sure we *know* what he's going to do.  Simply transporting back in time and killing a powerful leader without any confirmation he's going to end up killing 6 million Jews would make *you* look like the bad person, right?  After all, just bumping into him or anyone for that matter may significantly alter the future.  It may alter it enough to assure that our parents wouldn't have met and we wouldn't even be here right now.  Then again it may have been worth it, if it saves 6 million people.  Okay okay, these *are* good questions.Anyway all the people that are killed are dumped in the back yard with tomato plants growing on top of them as a way to cover the evidence.  A cop eventually catches onto these students.  Interesting a song that plays called ""Wicked Rain"" by a band called Los Lobos plays later- it totally reminds me of Blue Oyster Cult and I was almost 100% confident it WAS them but a google search reveals that no, it's not.It's honestly a pretty funny movie.  You have to NOT be offended by people dying in a nonchalant way like it's no big deal to probably really appreciate the type of comedy this is going for.  It's probably an ideal movie for those that just want to punch and kick those we disagree with, but of course, that would be illegal so we can't!A part of me believes that if all the negativity and stubbornness to respect other point of views from internet message boards ever became part of real-life discussions, something like *this* might occur!

And this movie definitely qualifies as different. It's intelligent political  humor and its not-so-subtle commentary on the effects of youthful idealism  are actually entertaining rather than tiresome and preachy. Even the overly  simplistic representation of the tomatoes for blood, which is most apparent  when you see the clear tomato-filled jars lining the shelves, didn't feel  like a glaring attempt at cinematic sophistication, but is instead realized  and relished.

I was first entranced with him as the sheriff in 'Desperation', though surely I'd seen him in film before that, but didn't specifically remember where.  He OWNED that role in Desperation, made the film as haunting as the book, which is by far the scariest book I've ever read.Came to find out, Perlman owns every role he plays, so I wanted to see this film.  Turns out, everyone in this film did a fabulous job, from script to scene shooting to film editing, and if you even miss a minute, you'll miss the film flow.  What's the story?  Well, you can find that, from the other reviews.  Point is, if you don't watch this film, you'll regret it.  If you have strong political views, you might find the film uncomfortable.  If you're a fundamentalist Christian and don't watch the film, you'll never see yourself as others see us, and never grow up in Christ.God is not a bigot, not out to kill dissent, but we make him out to be as petty and clueless about grace as we are.  So we play God, Christian or no.. and we become the characters in the film.  Ooops.Film editing and shooting of the scene angles is superb.

405767,A33FCLUEQSUD68,6304177259,Claire,"[0, 1]","I thought this movie was funny and cute with interesting characters, an unusual plot, some dark humor, lots of cameos and a great final twist at the end. It should appeal to anyone from their teens on up to grown adults- as long as they can appreciate some dark humor. Cameron Diaz did some interesting indie flicks with dark humor such as Very Bad Things, Being John Malkovich and this one among others. All the cast are funny as they try to cope with weeding out society's &#34;bad seeds&#34; giving them a last supper and trying to convince them to change their views or suffer death for their usually conservative beliefs. The movie's premise is that old philosophical question: if you met Hitler as a young boy, knowing you could alter the course of history and presumably save millions of innocent lives, would you kill him? This group of liberal Mid-Western grad students starts taking action against society's villains as they see them so they can feel like they are really contributing to making the world a better place instead of just talking about it. But they end up biting off more than they can chew when a local sheriff starts to suspect something... This movie is definitely a dark comedy but great fun.

Cooper ""Music Lover & Audiophile""","[10, 13]","This movie is an interesting surprise...a movie about free speech in which 5 prototypical liberal graduate students embark on a mission to rid the world of ideologues with whom they disagree.  One by one, they invite these unfortunate souls to their home for pasta, wine, and poison.  As more and more guests are buried in the tomato garden in the back yard, the quintet becomes more bloodthirsty and anxious about the morality of their actions.  When SNL veteran Nora Dunn appears as a police officer investigating the disappearance of their first victim, they become downright paranoid.  Finally, they encounter a Rush Limbaugh-style radio talk show host who, in person, makes cogent arguments supporting the right of everyone to think and say whatever they will and the group is forced to consider the moral implications of what it is doing.  The end of the movie is an entertaining resolution to this dilemma.The 5 housemates are all entertaining young actors, most notably Cameron Diaz and Annabeth Gish, and Nora Dunn is wonderful as the sheriff becoming increasingly suspicious of the bizarre actions of the housemates.  But the real stars of this cast are the cameos by the guests/victims, including Bill Pullman, Jason Alexander, and Ron Perlman, who does an outstanding job as the arrogant shock jock who unwittingly calls the housemates' scheme into question by simply making good arguments about the right to free speech for all people.This is not a deep film, and the stereotypes are drawn a bit thin in order to drive home the point, but it is an entertaining movie that should appeal to anyone who favors dark comedy and could be a good discussion starter over a glass of wine.

That's the question that Luke, the political science grad student asks his fellow grad students, all politically liberal and roommates in the same house in the aftermath of their killing an aggressive right-winger in self-defense?The philosophical question has been demonstrated before.  Mark asks if anyone went back in time to 1909 and met a certain Austrian artist with one testicle by the name of Adolf, would you kill him and save six million Jews from being burned in the Holocaust?  To that end, the five propose to invite certain people to dinner, give him/her a chance to logically state their rightist views, and if they pass, they drink a toast with wine from the safe green carafe.  If not, they get the fatal blue carafe with arsenic, and that's their ""last supper.""  As Luke says, ""think of all the right-wing &lt;expletives> the world would be better off without if somebody wasted them before any of them did any damage.""  I thought about it, and I felt like a groom after a particularly satisfying wedding night.The movie itself starts with Norman Arbuthnot (Ron Perlman), a bearded werewolf-looking politician with his rants on TV:  ""What we need in this country, my friends, is leadership, someone who can stand up to the liberals, a return to the promise of the Reagan/Bush years, a time of unequalled growth in our country.  Be careful folks, you might just get me [elected to office].""  While Paulie is visibly offended, Mark merely comments that Norman ""takes anything trivial and turns it into a national debate.""  Luke is calm about it:  ""always good to keep track of what the enemy is doing.""  In fact the ever-calm Luke seems to be the voice of reason and persuasion.  At first, anyway.Among the people who get the blue carafe is a reverend whose antihomosexual views extend to his response to AIDS being a disease by saying ""homosexuality is the disease.  AIDS is the cure.""  Another insists that women are the weaker sex and therefore need to be dominated.  Guess which carafe he gets?Courtney Vance has some witty lines.  On the Gulf War, he says, ""That was a war?  I thought it was a Republican commercial campaign.""  On their first victim:  ""I say we bury the cracker and eat dessert.""  Annabeth Gish's rationalizing their actions is that ""they're not people, they're people who hate.""One repeated motif that comes up are the jars of tomato juice that appear, symbolizing the blood the five have spilled.  The names of the five grad students are also interesting.  Paulie (Annabeth Gish), Jude (Cameron Diaz), Marc (Jonathan Penner), Luke (Courtney Vance), and Pete (Ron Eldard), which are synonymous with Paul, Judas, Mark, Luke, and Peter, five of Jesus's disciples.This does bring to mind, despite their good intentions, do they actually have the right to take someone's life, even if that someone offends their political sensibilities?

A group of left-wing graduate students put this theory into practice, after a chance meeting with a right-wing truck driver leads them down the path of murder and to the realization that some people deserve to die.""The Last Supper"" is one of my all-time favourite movies and has maintained its place in my top 20 film list, ever since I saw it for the first time on late-night television about 5 years ago. Although, as far as I can ascertain, the script of this film was written specifically for the screen, it actually plays out more like a stage play than a movie. Normally that would bother me, but in this case it doesn't, as this whole film is essentially a philosophical debate between left-wing and right-wing extremists, and it is for the dialogue that this film is of interest, not the action. One of the best things about this film is that, ultimately, the writer, Dan Rosen (who also wrote the equally excellent ""The Curve""), does not come down in favour of one side or the other in his debate. It is left to the audience to decide who they believe is right.I can imagine that ""The Last Supper"" might not be to everyone's tastes. In my family, alone, my father and I love it (after out most recent viewing, we spent several days discussing whether Rosen himself was on the side of the left or the right), but my mother hates it (she considers it to be too dark).

405774,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,6304177259,J from NY,"[2, 3]","Director Stacy Title and screenwriter Dan Rosen--surely at both's finest hour--created with this film perhaps the ultimate cautionary tale of what dehumanization and rage labels like ""liberal"" and ""conservatives"" can create when accepted as absolute identity.Rosen was at one time a stand up comic with a taste for dark humor, and ""The Last Supper"" provides that in spades (if you have the stomach for it).The plot of the film is really only a skeleton for what the creators are trying to say.  A group of liberal undergraduate college students invite vicious right-wing and well known Conservative pundits to for a pleasant dinner, and then perform a little ""Arsenic and Lace"" with a blue bottle of poison they mask as strong wine.  One has to suspend one's disbelief a little to enjoy the movie: if these people are so famous, why the hell don't they tell anyone where they're having dinner or who invited them?  People like Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Ann Coulter make sure they are heavily guarded at all times.  Though all five of them are involved, the leader (played with a perfect concentrated madness by a young Courtney B. Vance) Luke is the engine behind it all.At the beginning of the film a young soldier (Zac) returning home from the Persian Gulf War (""Was that a war or a Republican TV commercial?"" Luke unwisely asks) needs shelter from the rain.  The five make a bad choice and let him in.  Things go from unpleasant to bad to worse to homicidal as the anger builds between this maniac and the five students; he praises Hitler, deems liberals less than human beings, and puts a knife to the throat of Mark, a Jewish student.  He then proceeds to break the arm of another member, lets him fall to the ground, and Mark stabs him in the back.This is an important part in the film.  It wasn't *exactly* self defense.  While this guy was obviously sociopathic and may have hurt the rest of them, a second viewing shows Mark approach long after his friend has hit the ground and is no longer in danger.  It's hard to feel sympathy for Zac, but this is really how it starts.  Luke jumps right on the bandwagon, stating coldly: ""We should just finish dessert and bury the cracker.""Later on, a local female sherrif shows up asking about Zac.  He had, apparently, raped murdered a young girl in the community before arriving.  This fuels the group's thoughts that if they kill these people before they live out a natural life, they may be saving the world from great harm.  The ancient shoulda woulda coulda question is asked repeatedly, at the film's climax: ""It's 1909.  You find yourself in a bar with a young artist named Adolf Hitler.  Do you kill him to save billions of people?""Title and Rosen toy with the viewer, swaying from the wussy excesses of ultra liberals to the outright evil of the far right.  Both become annoying.  Still, though, when we encounter ""Norman"" (Ron Perlman), the group's main target, we see what they are driving at.A hilarious masterpiece, more relevant today than ever.",5,"""Let's have a toast!""",1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,3014,"['Director', 'Stacy', 'Title', 'screenwriter', 'Dan', 'Rosen', 'surely', 'finest', 'hour', 'created', 'film', 'perhaps', 'ultimate', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'what', 'dehumanization', 'rage', 'labels', 'liberal', 'conservatives', 'can', 'create', 'when', 'accepted', 'absolute', 'identity.Rosen', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'stand', 'up', 'comic', 'taste', 'dark', 'humor', 'Last', 'Supper', 'spades', 'have', 'stomach', 'plot', 'film', 'really', 'only', 'skeleton', 'what', 'creators', 'are', 'trying', 'say', 'group', 'liberal', 'undergraduate', 'college', 'students', 'invite', 'vicious', 'right-wing', 'well', 'known', 'Conservative', 'pundits', 'pleasant', 'dinner', 'then', 'perform', 'little', 'Arsenic', 'Lace', 'blue', 'bottle', 'poison', 'mask', 'strong', 'wine', 'One', 'suspend', 'one', 'disbelief', 'little', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'famous', 'why', 'hell', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'where', ""'re"", 'having', 'dinner', 'who', 'invited', 'People', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh', 'Glenn', 'Beck', 'Ann', 'Coulter', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'heavily', 'guarded', 'times', 'five', 'are', 'involved', 'leader', 'played', 'perfect', 'concentrated', 'madness', 'young', 'Courtney', 'B.', 'Vance', 'Luke', 'engine', 'beginning', 'film', 'young', 'soldier', 'Zac', 'returning', 'home', 'Persian', 'Gulf', 'War', 'Was', 'war', 'Republican', 'TV', 'commercial', 'Luke', 'unwisely', 'shelter', 'rain', 'five', 'make', 'bad', 'choice', 'let', 'Things', 'go', 'unpleasant', 'bad', 'worse', 'homicidal', 'anger', 'maniac', 'five', 'students', 'Hitler', 'liberals', 'less', 'human', 'beings', 'knife', 'throat', 'Mark', 'Jewish', 'student', 'then', 'break', 'arm', 'member', 'fall', 'ground', 'Mark', 'stabs', 'back.This', 'important', 'part', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", '*exactly*', 'self', 'defense', 'guy', 'was', 'obviously', 'sociopathic', 'may', 'have', 'hurt', 'rest', 'second', 'viewing', 'shows', 'Mark', 'approach', 'long', 'friend', 'hit', 'ground', 'longer', 'danger', 'hard', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Zac', 'really', 'how', 'Luke', 'jumps', 'right', 'bandwagon', 'stating', 'coldly', 'should', 'just', 'finish', 'dessert', 'bury', 'cracker', 'Later', 'local', 'female', 'sherrif', 'up', 'asking', 'Zac', 'had', 'apparently', 'raped', 'murdered', 'young', 'girl', 'community', 'arriving', 'group', 'thoughts', 'kill', 'people', 'live', 'out', 'natural', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'saving', 'world', 'great', 'harm', 'ancient', 'shoulda', 'woulda', 'coulda', 'question', 'asked', 'repeatedly', 'film', 'climax', '1909', 'find', 'bar', 'young', 'artist', 'named', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'Do', 'kill', 'save', 'billions', 'people', 'Title', 'Rosen', 'toy', 'viewer', 'swaying', 'wussy', 'excesses', 'ultra', 'liberals', 'outright', 'evil', 'far', 'right', 'become', 'annoying', 'Still', 'though', 'when', 'encounter', 'Norman', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'group', 'main', 'target', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'driving', 'at.A', 'hilarious', 'masterpiece', 'more', 'relevant', 'today', 'ever']",Last Supper VHS

In ""The Last Supper,"" the audience gets to see just that.  Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard and Annabeth Gish head up a quintet of superior-minded liberals who quickly gain a taste for murder after helping out a right-wing nutjob (Bill Paxton).When Paxton goes too far at the supper table, it costs him his life.  This sets into motion a string of murders by the five like-minded friends.  They invite right-wing enemies to their supper table and throw questions at them in order to determine whether the conservative lives or dies.As the bodies pile up, the lust for blood grows stronger in some members of the group.  The local sheriff (a solid Nora Dunn) is also growing suspicious of the group and the wonderful tomatoes that begin to grow in their back yard.Soon enough, the group encounters the holy grail of all conservatism, a loudmouthed Rush Limbaugh-type character played to perfection by Ron Perlman.  When he proves to be a strong adversary, the group unravels and begins to argue with itself about whether or not Perlman should live or die.In the end, though, Perlman's fate is determined.  Does he live or die?  You'll have to watch this dark comedy to find out.The strongest performances in ""The Last Supper"" come via Perlman and Courtney B. Vance, who plays one of the loftiest of the five murderers.  Gish and Eldard are exceptionally over-the-top in their performances, actually weakening the film a bit.Overall, this film takes no sides in the political arena.  Sure leftist loonies appear to have the upper hand throughout, but conservatives get a few punches in too.I recommend this film to liberals so that they can live out some of their wildest fantasies.  Extreme right-wingers are given their just desserts.  I also recommend this film to conservatives because it gives a hilarious look into the lives lefties who believe they know what's best for everyone but, when given a strong adversary, fall all to pieces and actually turn on one another.",4,A Sinister Superiority Complex,1236384000,"03 7, 2009",2009,2059,"['Have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'hardcore', 'liberals', 'dream', 'doing', 'right-wing', 'adversaries', 'Last', 'Supper', 'audience', 'see', 'just', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'head', 'up', 'quintet', 'superior-minded', 'liberals', 'who', 'quickly', 'gain', 'taste', 'murder', 'helping', 'out', 'right-wing', 'nutjob', 'Bill', 'Paxton', '.When', 'Paxton', 'too', 'far', 'supper', 'table', 'life', 'motion', 'string', 'murders', 'five', 'like-minded', 'friends', 'invite', 'right-wing', 'enemies', 'supper', 'table', 'throw', 'questions', 'order', 'determine', 'conservative', 'lives', 'dies.As', 'bodies', 'pile', 'up', 'lust', 'blood', 'grows', 'stronger', 'members', 'group', 'local', 'sheriff', 'solid', 'Nora', 'Dunn', 'also', 'growing', 'suspicious', 'group', 'wonderful', 'tomatoes', 'begin', 'grow', 'back', 'yard.Soon', 'enough', 'group', 'holy', 'grail', 'conservatism', 'loudmouthed', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh-type', 'character', 'played', 'perfection', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'When', 'be', 'strong', 'adversary', 'group', 'unravels', 'begins', 'argue', 'not', 'Perlman', 'should', 'live', 'die.In', 'end', 'Perlman', 'fate', 'determined', 'live', 'die', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'dark', 'comedy', 'find', 'out.The', 'strongest', 'performances', 'Last', 'Supper', 'come', 'Perlman', 'Courtney', 'B.', 'Vance', 'who', 'one', 'loftiest', 'five', 'murderers', 'Gish', 'Eldard', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'over-the-top', 'performances', 'actually', 'weakening', 'film', 'bit.Overall', 'film', 'sides', 'political', 'arena', 'Sure', 'leftist', 'loonies', 'appear', 'have', 'upper', 'hand', 'get', 'few', 'punches', 'too.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'liberals', 'can', 'live', 'out', 'wildest', 'fantasies', 'Extreme', 'right-wingers', 'are', 'given', 'just', 'desserts', 'also', 'recommend', 'film', 'conservatives', 'hilarious', 'look', 'lives', 'lefties', 'who', 'believe', 'know', 'what', 'best', 'everyone', 'when', 'given', 'strong', 'adversary', 'fall', 'pieces', 'actually', 'turn', 'one']",Last Supper VHS

I think, yes. Even if I spent the entire time banging my head against the wall for the whole time, it would have been a far better endeavor than watching this trash.While ultimately this film tries to make you think about tolerating the opinion of the next person, it conducts its' lesson by creating conservative stereotypes as manifested by left-wingers. So if the roles had been reversed, liberals would be screaming about this film years later. But since the Hollywood community is controlled by left-wingers, you don't hear a peep out of anyone in that industry about the horrible personalities created by this film.The sad thing is that the characters created in this film are really how Hollywood sees conservatives. Left-wingers actually create these people and truly believe that this is the way conservatives think and act. Of course, conservatives don't think and act as depicted in this film but left-wingers don't understand this point. This is the main reason why liberalism is a dying idealogy in the U.S. It's an idealogy that just doesn't get it. It creates enemies that don't exist and in fighting these imaginary enemies, their real opponents walk away the victor.This might have been a good film if the &quot;conservatives&quot; in the film were real. That their opinions were those of real conservatives. But the problem would have been that the liberal characters would have been seen in a far worse light than just murderers; they would have been seen as irrational lunatics that can't see reason. And that's not what the director was trying to show. The idea was to show liberals as being well-intentioned yet mistaken in their methods.If they had done the film correctly, conservatives would be invited to supper, they would have explained real-world thinking to the liberals, and the liberals would have killed the conservatives simply because they could not grasp what mainstream America already embraces as its' philosophy. But, again, this would have taken the film in too far of a supportive perspective of conservatives and that's certainly not acceptable to the producers of this poorly conceived tripe.",1,What if...,1067040000,"10 25, 2003",2003,2283,"[""'m"", 'thinking', 'quot', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'watching', 'trash', 'disguised', 'entertainment', 'quot', 'Would', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'more', 'productive', 'think', 'yes', 'Even', 'spent', 'entire', 'time', 'banging', 'head', 'wall', 'whole', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'endeavor', 'watching', 'trash.While', 'ultimately', 'film', 'make', 'think', 'tolerating', 'opinion', 'next', 'person', 'lesson', 'creating', 'conservative', 'stereotypes', 'manifested', 'left-wingers', 'So', 'roles', 'had', 'been', 'reversed', 'liberals', 'would', 'be', 'screaming', 'film', 'years', 'later', 'Hollywood', 'community', 'controlled', 'left-wingers', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'peep', 'anyone', 'industry', 'horrible', 'personalities', 'created', 'film.The', 'sad', 'thing', 'characters', 'created', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'conservatives', 'Left-wingers', 'actually', 'create', 'people', 'truly', 'believe', 'way', 'think', 'act', 'course', 'conservatives', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'act', 'depicted', 'film', 'left-wingers', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'point', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'liberalism', 'dying', 'idealogy', 'U.S', 'idealogy', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'enemies', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'fighting', 'imaginary', 'enemies', 'real', 'opponents', 'walk', 'away', 'victor.This', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'film', 'quot', 'conservatives', 'quot', 'film', 'were', 'real', 'opinions', 'were', 'real', 'conservatives', 'problem', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'liberal', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'far', 'worse', 'light', 'just', 'murderers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'irrational', 'lunatics', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'not', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'idea', 'was', 'show', 'liberals', 'being', 'well-intentioned', 'yet', 'mistaken', 'methods.If', 'had', 'done', 'film', 'correctly', 'conservatives', 'would', 'be', 'invited', 'supper', 'would', 'have', 'explained', 'real-world', 'thinking', 'liberals', 'liberals', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'conservatives', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'grasp', 'what', 'mainstream', 'America', 'already', 'philosophy', 'again', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'film', 'too', 'far', 'supportive', 'perspective', 'conservatives', 'certainly', 'not', 'acceptable', 'producers', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'tripe']",Last Supper VHS

Quick plot summary--a group of liberals who dine together invite a guest every week (or something like that) until they invite truck driver Bill Paxton.  Being a right-winger, this guy starts a fight, is killed at the dinner table, and the merry group decides it's for the best and then comes up with an idea--why not continue the weekly dinners, invite those of the right-wing and then poison them.  It's a good idea for a movie, and it has some potential philosophical questions, but you won't find much worth seeing here.  The story is very standard and predictable.  They kill ""undesireables"" until some of them start experiencing guilt and suddenly we are thrown into a Dostoyevsky-like senario much like ""Crime and Punishment.""But unlike Dostoyevsky, there is no moment of truth.  Instead the group finds it's one last victim, this guy who is like Rush Limbaugh, and decides to provide a great service to humanity by killing this hate monger.  I'll leave it there.  Fact is, all the characters are pretty one dimensional, and their developement is very base.  None of them are in the least bit likeable or interesting, and really, I watched this hoping something interesting would happen, like Alice Cooper shows up all pissed off or something.  Every time the movie tries to get some deep point across, it just comes off of trivial and lame.  I did like Bill paxton, and I read one review in which I totally agree with--watch the first 10 minutes with Paxton, then shut it off.  Annabeth Gish was good, too, but I always like her in whatever she does.I gave this movie 2 stars because it is watchable, it's just not very good and I wont be watching it ever again.
