1098110,A1R1MCAWY0KM4V,B000V02CNW,"Bruce Brocka ""Prof Wombat""","[0, 0]","If one didn't know much about this period of history, one might think that this docu-drama represented historical truth, which it does not. It takes a speculation and presents it in a fairly entertaining way.The ""Princes in the Tower"" were the unfortunate sons of Edward IV, the first Yorkist king, the eldest of whom should have succeeded him upon his death. However, Richard, the brother of Edward IV, took the opportunity to cast doubt upon the legitimacy of the children (Edward being an incorrigible rake), and establish himself to the throne (briefly) until defeated in battle by The Earl of Richmond, Henry Tudor, who became Henry VII (the father of Henry VIII).The question this work attempts to answer is: Who killed the children? and Was Perkin Warbeck one of these children? For the sake of drama, the docu-drama would have you think there was some doubt that Perkin was an impostor. Historically, it seems that there was little to no doubt even from the outset that Perkin was indeed merely a tool of the Yorkist sympathizers. The more interesting and still unanswered question of history is who killed the Princes? Most think it was Richard, as he had the most to gain. However, it is possible, if unlikely, that Henry Tudor had them killed. His mother was indeed married to Lord Stanley, who had access at the highest levels until his defection at Bosworth Field, when Henry won the crown by conquest. This possible if unlikely theory is then taken straight over the top by postulating that Margaret Beaufort (Henry VII's mother) kept the adult ""princes"" in some hidden horror chamber, reduced to tongueless beasts.So, I found this work unsatisfying, historically, even though several performances were quite good: the ever more than capable John Castle as Dr. Argentine, the Bishop of Cambrai, and the portrayal of Henry Tudor. Further, the production was marred by various stylistic quirks I found unappealing, although on the whole it was fairly straight forward. I also found the very odd appearance of Elizabeth of York (Henry's wife, Perkin's alleged sister)to be jarringly bizarre.So - I wouldn't foist this off on those new to the history of the Wars of the Roses, but it is an entertaining enough diversion if one is familiar with that territory",3,"A mixed bag, both in history and presentation",1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,2268,"['one', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'period', 'history', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'docu-drama', 'represented', 'historical', 'truth', 'not', 'speculation', 'presents', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'way.The', 'Princes', 'Tower', 'were', 'unfortunate', 'sons', 'Edward', 'IV', 'first', 'Yorkist', 'king', 'eldest', 'whom', 'should', 'have', 'succeeded', 'death', 'However', 'Richard', 'brother', 'Edward', 'IV', 'took', 'opportunity', 'cast', 'doubt', 'legitimacy', 'children', 'Edward', 'being', 'incorrigible', 'rake', 'establish', 'throne', 'briefly', 'defeated', 'battle', 'Earl', 'Richmond', 'Henry', 'Tudor', 'who', 'became', 'Henry', 'VII', 'father', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'question', 'work', 'answer', 'Who', 'killed', 'children', 'Was', 'Perkin', 'Warbeck', 'one', 'children', 'sake', 'drama', 'docu-drama', 'would', 'have', 'think', 'was', 'doubt', 'Perkin', 'was', 'impostor', 'Historically', 'was', 'little', 'doubt', 'even', 'outset', 'Perkin', 'was', 'indeed', 'merely', 'tool', 'Yorkist', 'sympathizers', 'more', 'interesting', 'still', 'unanswered', 'question', 'history', 'who', 'killed', 'Princes', 'Most', 'think', 'was', 'Richard', 'had', 'most', 'gain', 'However', 'possible', 'unlikely', 'Henry', 'Tudor', 'had', 'killed', 'mother', 'was', 'indeed', 'married', 'Lord', 'Stanley', 'who', 'had', 'access', 'highest', 'levels', 'defection', 'Bosworth', 'Field', 'when', 'Henry', 'won', 'crown', 'conquest', 'possible', 'unlikely', 'theory', 'then', 'taken', 'straight', 'top', 'postulating', 'Margaret', 'Beaufort', 'Henry', 'VII', 'mother', 'kept', 'adult', 'princes', 'hidden', 'horror', 'chamber', 'reduced', 'tongueless', 'beasts.So', 'found', 'work', 'unsatisfying', 'historically', 'even', 'several', 'performances', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'ever', 'more', 'capable', 'John', 'Castle', 'Dr.', 'Argentine', 'Bishop', 'Cambrai', 'portrayal', 'Henry', 'Tudor', 'Further', 'production', 'was', 'marred', 'various', 'stylistic', 'quirks', 'found', 'unappealing', 'whole', 'was', 'fairly', 'straight', 'forward', 'also', 'found', 'very', 'odd', 'appearance', 'Elizabeth', 'York', 'Henry', 'wife', 'Perkin', 'alleged', 'sister', 'be', 'jarringly', 'bizarre.So', 'would', ""n't"", 'foist', 'off', 'new', 'history', 'Wars', 'Roses', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'diversion', 'one', 'familiar', 'territory']",Princes in the Tower

This movie is about the most interesting of them, Perkin Warbeck (who may very well have been the younger prince). The movie focuses on how the princes in the tower may have met their end, if indeed they died there, and who may have been responsible. The end is a little convoluted, and not true to actual history.
