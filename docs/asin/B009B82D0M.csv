Something or another about a Space Shuttlethat never runs out of fuel that has a mission to Mercury. If I remember myhighschool science -- I'm 63, now -- Mercury is the closest planet to our Sun.It is so hot there, your underwear would melt if you were dumb enough to go there.Well, this Space Shuttle, that never runs out of fuel, has the mission to ""walk onthe planet."" Don't think so.Everybody just, unexplainably, drops dead on the Shuttle except this gal that ismarried to this guy that got fired from some anti-asteroid killer program that wasdropped from the Defense budget -- get this -- after it was fully built in a high-Earth Orbit.This genius [her HUSBAND] they fired is the Earth's only hope, aided by two nerdcollege students with a ""Universal"" broadcast studio in a biefcase... that works-- perfectly -- without any visible antennae from Earth to Mercury. Back and forth,with NO delays at all.So... Mercury flies out of orbit and becomes a... a.... I think it was called a Mega-tar/Magnitar or something, which is a scholarly word for a Magnetized Planet.Mercury is hurtling toward our planet, and -- again, unexplainably -- sucks up SOME[but not all] metal things like lamp posts; cars; mailboxes; trashcans, and this andthat. Fine; but it also hurtles SOME of this stuff right back to Earth with occasionalsmall pieces of Mercury.The special effects (SFX) are best when you watch the movie on a 40"" screen -- I guess --because the rendered automobiles often look like those $1.20 Matchbox cars... at least onmy 55"" Bravia.I e-n-j-o-y-e-d the short hour an' a half flick. It was exciting, and while I could find faultwith the film's logic and SFX; and do, I found it no worse than a schlocky film from the'50s, '60s, or '70s...but, with much better SFX.Mind you, the SFX is not the ""seamless"" quality of Avatar or Men In Black III. It IS a goodPOPCORN, and BEER in the den movie... what the hell get the kids some SODA, too!I've seen BETTER, and I'll see WORSE.It was an acceptable SyFi Channel movie-of-the-month --- or whatever THEY call it in America.I live in Germany, and buy all the SyFi Channel -- and Roger Corman-like --- produced films Ican get my hands on.The movie won't get any Emmys or Oscars, but I say from my Sony Bravia: ""Bravo!""Make another one... how 'bout the Earth colliding with the Sun: ""COLLISION SUN""(?)",4,COLLISION EARTH,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,2521,"['DVD', 'buck', 'less', 'Blu-ray.The', 'picture', 'EXCELLENT', 'sound', 'are', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'trailers/previews.The', 'story', 'little', 'contrived', 'Something', 'Space', 'Shuttlethat', 'never', 'fuel', 'mission', 'Mercury', 'remember', 'myhighschool', 'science', ""'m"", '63', 'now', 'Mercury', 'closest', 'planet', 'Sun.It', 'so', 'hot', 'there', 'underwear', 'would', 'melt', 'were', 'dumb', 'enough', 'go', 'there.Well', 'Space', 'Shuttle', 'never', 'fuel', 'mission', 'walk', 'onthe', 'planet', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.Everybody', 'just', 'unexplainably', 'drops', 'dead', 'Shuttle', 'gal', 'ismarried', 'guy', 'got', 'fired', 'anti-asteroid', 'killer', 'program', 'wasdropped', 'Defense', 'budget', 'get', 'was', 'fully', 'built', 'high-Earth', 'Orbit.This', 'genius', '[', 'HUSBAND', ']', 'fired', 'Earth', 'only', 'hope', 'aided', 'two', 'nerdcollege', 'students', 'Universal', 'broadcast', 'studio', 'biefcase', 'perfectly', 'visible', 'antennae', 'Earth', 'Mercury', 'Back', 'forth', 'NO', 'delays', 'all.So', 'Mercury', 'orbit', 'think', 'was', 'called', 'Mega-tar/Magnitar', 'something', 'scholarly', 'word', 'Magnetized', 'Planet.Mercury', 'hurtling', 'planet', 'again', 'unexplainably', 'up', 'SOME', '[', 'not', ']', 'metal', 'things', 'lamp', 'posts', 'cars', 'mailboxes', 'trashcans', 'andthat', 'Fine', 'also', 'SOME', 'stuff', 'right', 'back', 'Earth', 'occasionalsmall', 'pieces', 'Mercury.The', 'special', 'effects', 'SFX', 'are', 'best', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', '40', 'screen', 'guess', 'rendered', 'automobiles', 'often', 'look', '1.20', 'Matchbox', 'cars', 'least', 'onmy', '55', 'Bravia.I', 'e-n-j-o-y-e-d', 'short', 'hour', 'half', 'flick', 'was', 'exciting', 'could', 'find', 'faultwith', 'film', 'logic', 'SFX', 'do', 'found', 'worse', 'schlocky', 'film', ""the'50s"", ""'70s"", 'much', 'better', 'SFX.Mind', 'SFX', 'not', 'seamless', 'quality', 'Avatar', 'Men', 'Black', 'III', 'goodPOPCORN', 'BEER', 'den', 'movie', 'what', 'hell', 'get', 'kids', 'SODA', 'too', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'BETTER', ""'ll"", 'see', 'WORSE.It', 'was', 'acceptable', 'SyFi', 'Channel', 'movie-of-the-month', 'THEY', 'call', 'America.I', 'live', 'Germany', 'buy', 'SyFi', 'Channel', 'Roger', 'Corman-like', 'produced', 'films', 'Ican', 'get', 'hands', 'on.The', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'Emmys', 'Oscars', 'say', 'Sony', 'Bravia', 'Bravo', 'Make', 'one', 'how', 'Earth', 'colliding', 'Sun', 'COLLISION', 'SUN']",N/A

Everyday that passes, though, the now-magnetized planet gets closer and closer & that triggers chaos around the world: Flaming meteors that crash into the ground. Automobiles are sucked into the sky. The worst is yet to come.I'll be honest, normally with disaster movies of this ilk(by The Asylum)- I try not to have high expectations. Most of these type of movies are, basically, the same. I came into this one thinking Collision Earth would be a decent time waster but, like everyone else, went away quite disappointed.Considering it's a low-budget disaster flick, I can deal with the cheap CGI and special effects...that's what makes movies like this so enjoyable. Where this film went wrong was with the poor acting. You could tell they really weren't into making this movie, as so much as a paycheck, as they really weren't giving their acting any passion. It was too stiff.  Second, all the scientific hooha in this movie is just downright unbelievable, at times. I mean, if you're going to make a movie of this sort, at least make it reasonable that it might happen. Third, it could've been an entertaining waste of time but, most of the time, you just really don't care about the characters in the movie...and that, in turn, makes it a dull movie...not entertaining.I'll admit, it's not the worst SyFy movie I've ever seen...probably won't be the last one I ever see...but it's the dullest one I've seen for sure.

1594433,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,B009B82D0M,Dave,"[4, 5]","Save for when I was 5 years old and too young to know better, this film had to be an embarrassment to many of those involved.  Please remember the following names:  John Prince and Paul Ziller.  They were the Producer and Director, respectively, of Collision Earth.  I ask that you remember them because I think it is unlikely that you will ever see or hear their names again.  Also please note that the names of the Producer and Director were flashed onto the screen for less than one second each during the opening credits but their names appear nowhere in the ending credits.This was a rather low budget film, but the budget should have been much lower because they had enough money to spend on this film to make it even worse than it could have been.  Instead of having no special FX, they spent money to produce the most improbable and stupid FX their budget could buy.  Try magnetic fields from the sun filling the air on Earth with demolished cars falling to the ground at about 5 mph and when they hit the earth, they all land in the middle of a country road that the ""star"" of the film happens to be driving upon.  Of course, none of the cars hit his vehicle but he manages to hit one of them.  Later, while a soldier is holding a gun on our star, one of the magnetized cars falls directly upon the soldier.  Or, how about a space craft resembling the space shuttle cruising through what appears to be an impossibly dense and unnavigable asteroid field near Mercury.  OK, but the pilot of the ""space shuttle"" is the co-star and she is piloting her spacecraft at speeds close to 8 mph while screaming with her eyes closed.  While she is responsible for many scrapes and fender benders inflicted upon her spacecraft, she never hits an asteroid one head on.  Later we find out that the asteroid belt near Mercury was actually many rocks and boulders from Mercury that were somehow cast into space by the magnetic fields created by the Sun.  It seems that the spontaneous appearance of magnetic fields causes damage by influencing metallic objects (and non-metallic objects when necessary) to move in any one of the three dimensions of our world, but that the movement and associated damage or harm is further influenced by the presence of bad guys because the objects have a tendency to fall upon them.  There also a number of just plain old mistakes written into the script such as a character hanging up a phone or radio and driving away before the party with whom they were speaking can him them what number or frequency to use to call them back.  In the next scene, he is calling them back at the unknown number.  If that is not a mistake, why does the other party say ""I'll give you the number"" but never does?  There are also a number of deaths from violent injuries during the film where the bodies of the deceased do not appear to have any wounds.  The most mistakes were made by repeatedly ignoring physics in a film depending upon science for its plot.  I could go on and on having watched the movie only once.  Who knows how many more mistakes would be found by a person actually challenged to find mistakes, not by someone who is bored with this dismal example of filmmaking at its worst.  I could not bring myself to watch it again.It takes money to make a movie.  I do not think there are many who would make a full-length film without a profit motive.  I noticed in the ending credits some mention of ""Canadian Tax Credits"" of which I know nothing.  Could it be that this film was subsidized somehow by the Canadian government?  I do not know, but it might provide some rationale for making this film if someone were receiving tax benefits for doing so.  Another possibility is that a wealthy individual might want to buy a film production in order to make a spouse a star who would not be able to do so without such assistance.  I doubt that is the case but I suppose it is possible.  My problem is that I cannot accept that anyone would make a film destined to be as bad as Collision Earth without some overriding objective.  And why would anyone want to associate themselves with such a poor production?  Lastly, why are their 7 out of nine reviewers who gave it a rating better than one star?  There may be some whose sense of humor will allow them to laugh at this movie from beginning to end.  Collision Earth could be easily rewritten to become a parody or satire, but as it stands there is no a humor to be found.I have already spent more time than it is worth warning others how bad this film is.  But by writing a short review, am I giving this film more attention than it deserves?  Probably.  I originally viewed the film looking for the possibility of some interesting new scientific theory explaining how some new disaster could threaten our existence.  However, there was no such theory here, there wasn't even any science.  It is just a big waste of time and money.",1,This film should not have been made.,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,4902,"['Save', 'when', 'was', '5', 'years', 'old', 'too', 'young', 'know', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'be', 'embarrassment', 'many', 'involved', 'Please', 'remember', 'following', 'names', 'John', 'Prince', 'Paul', 'Ziller', 'were', 'Producer', 'Director', 'respectively', 'Collision', 'Earth', 'ask', 'remember', 'think', 'unlikely', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'hear', 'names', 'again', 'Also', 'please', 'note', 'names', 'Producer', 'Director', 'were', 'flashed', 'screen', 'less', 'one', 'second', 'opening', 'credits', 'names', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'ending', 'credits.This', 'was', 'rather', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'budget', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'lower', 'had', 'enough', 'money', 'spend', 'film', 'make', 'even', 'worse', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Instead', 'having', 'special', 'FX', 'spent', 'money', 'produce', 'most', 'improbable', 'stupid', 'FX', 'budget', 'could', 'buy', 'Try', 'magnetic', 'fields', 'sun', 'filling', 'air', 'Earth', 'demolished', 'cars', 'falling', 'ground', '5', 'mph', 'when', 'hit', 'earth', 'land', 'middle', 'country', 'road', 'star', 'film', 'be', 'driving', 'course', 'none', 'cars', 'hit', 'vehicle', 'hit', 'one', 'Later', 'soldier', 'holding', 'gun', 'star', 'one', 'magnetized', 'cars', 'directly', 'soldier', 'how', 'space', 'craft', 'resembling', 'space', 'shuttle', 'cruising', 'what', 'be', 'impossibly', 'dense', 'unnavigable', 'asteroid', 'field', 'Mercury', 'OK', 'pilot', 'space', 'shuttle', 'co-star', 'piloting', 'spacecraft', 'speeds', 'close', '8', 'mph', 'screaming', 'eyes', 'closed', 'responsible', 'many', 'scrapes', 'fender', 'benders', 'inflicted', 'spacecraft', 'never', 'asteroid', 'one', 'head', 'Later', 'find', 'out', 'asteroid', 'belt', 'Mercury', 'was', 'actually', 'many', 'rocks', 'boulders', 'Mercury', 'were', 'somehow', 'cast', 'space', 'magnetic', 'fields', 'created', 'Sun', 'spontaneous', 'appearance', 'magnetic', 'fields', 'causes', 'damage', 'influencing', 'metallic', 'objects', 'non-metallic', 'objects', 'when', 'necessary', 'move', 'one', 'three', 'dimensions', 'world', 'movement', 'associated', 'damage', 'harm', 'further', 'influenced', 'presence', 'bad', 'guys', 'objects', 'have', 'tendency', 'fall', 'also', 'number', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'mistakes', 'written', 'script', 'such', 'character', 'hanging', 'up', 'phone', 'radio', 'driving', 'away', 'party', 'whom', 'were', 'speaking', 'can', 'what', 'number', 'frequency', 'use', 'call', 'back', 'next', 'scene', 'calling', 'back', 'unknown', 'number', 'not', 'mistake', 'why', 'other', 'party', 'say', ""'ll"", 'give', 'number', 'never', 'are', 'also', 'number', 'deaths', 'violent', 'injuries', 'film', 'where', 'bodies', 'deceased', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'wounds', 'most', 'mistakes', 'were', 'made', 'repeatedly', 'ignoring', 'physics', 'film', 'depending', 'science', 'plot', 'could', 'go', 'having', 'watched', 'movie', 'only', 'once', 'Who', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'mistakes', 'would', 'be', 'found', 'person', 'actually', 'challenged', 'find', 'mistakes', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'bored', 'dismal', 'example', 'filmmaking', 'worst', 'could', 'not', 'bring', 'watch', 'again.It', 'money', 'make', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'full-length', 'film', 'profit', 'motive', 'noticed', 'ending', 'credits', 'mention', 'Canadian', 'Tax', 'Credits', 'know', 'nothing', 'Could', 'be', 'film', 'was', 'subsidized', 'somehow', 'Canadian', 'government', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'might', 'provide', 'rationale', 'making', 'film', 'someone', 'were', 'receiving', 'tax', 'benefits', 'doing', 'so', 'possibility', 'wealthy', 'individual', 'might', 'want', 'buy', 'film', 'production', 'order', 'make', 'spouse', 'star', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'such', 'assistance', 'doubt', 'case', 'suppose', 'possible', 'problem', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'anyone', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'destined', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'Collision', 'Earth', 'overriding', 'objective', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'associate', 'poor', 'production', 'Lastly', 'why', 'are', '7', 'nine', 'reviewers', 'who', 'gave', 'rating', 'better', 'one', 'star', 'may', 'be', 'sense', 'humor', 'will', 'allow', 'laugh', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'Collision', 'Earth', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'rewritten', 'become', 'parody', 'satire', 'humor', 'be', 'found.I', 'have', 'already', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'worth', 'warning', 'others', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'writing', 'short', 'review', 'am', 'giving', 'film', 'more', 'attention', 'Probably', 'originally', 'viewed', 'film', 'looking', 'possibility', 'interesting', 'new', 'scientific', 'theory', 'explaining', 'how', 'new', 'disaster', 'could', 'threaten', 'existence', 'However', 'was', 'such', 'theory', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'science', 'just', 'big', 'waste', 'time', 'money']",N/A

In a space ship they turn off the artificial gravity device (whatever that is) as things float around, yet after a disaster, they have gravity as the woman works to restore oxygen. She is not wearing an oxygen mask, while her fellow crewman next to her needs one. The special effects and science reminded me of another sci-fi disaster film, ""Metal Storm.""If the planet Mercury was knocked out of orbit, this is not something our government could keep secret as any amateur astronomer knows. The whole world would almost instantly know about it. And why would a conspiracy theorist broadcast this on a pirate radio in the middle of no where, where no one will hear it rather than just post it on line? When was this screenplay written? 1950?The film overestimates the power of magnetism over gravity, something Velikovsky did about 60 years ago. The magnetar which caused Mercury to become magnetic originates in neutron stars, which our sun is not. It also emits high levels of gamma radiation which would have fried all members of the spaceship, even with their radiation shields which would have been manufactured for proton radiation and not gamma.Enough with the geek science stuff. It is PG so the kids might like it. Not any better than the free movies on SyFy.
