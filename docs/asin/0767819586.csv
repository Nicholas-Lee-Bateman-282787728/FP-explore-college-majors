Yes, there are similarities in that both are set in mental hospitals and both portray the rigidities of the system.  But &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is an Orwellian parody of the total institution and the way in which evil individuals can abuse their power to crush the spirit.  It has implications beyond the limited arena in which it's set.  &quot;Girl, Interrupted,&quot;  on the other hand, is a story of healing, of how a damaged individual, in this case Susannah as played by Winona Ryder, can move from fighting the institution to using its resources to transform herself into a wholer, healtheir human being.The strength of this film lies in its acting.  Yes, there are cliches (which is why the 4 stars instead of 5), but the story moves quite well in spite of them.  Jolie's Lisa and Ryder's Susannah are the two poles around which the film's narrative spins.  Lisa is the spectacularly disturbed but charismatic figure to whom Ryder's quieter and initially terrified character is drawn, like a moth to a flame.  But, as many moths learn, flames can burn, and Lisa's energy is ultimately destructive.  The film's turning point comes when Susannah finally realizes this after Lisa's actions have destroyed another character.  This devatstating event forces Susannah to reassess her friend, herself and her surroundings--and to make an active choice to get well.As I noted the strength of this film lies in its performances.  Jolie's acting is flashier, as befits her character.  Ryder's acting is more subtle, as she moves from being a terrified newcomer on the ward to one of the gang and finally to a young woman about to be released.  You can see the changes in the amount of physical space Ryder seems to fill.  The rest of the cast is also amazing--not a false note here.  In a lesser movie, the minor characters would not have mattered as much.  But in &quot;Girl, Interrupted,&quot; the characters created by the supporting actors and actresses contribute as much to the film's success as do those of Ryder and Jolie.",4,NOT a female &quot;Cuckoo's Nest.&quot;,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,2288,"['film', 'based', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'memoir', 'experiences', 'inpatient', 'long-term', 'psychiattric', 'facility', 'sometimes', 'been', 'called', 'female', 'version', 'quot', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest.', 'quot', 'opinion', 'comparison', 'misleading', 'Yes', 'are', 'similarities', 'are', 'set', 'mental', 'hospitals', 'portray', 'rigidities', 'system', 'quot', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'quot', 'Orwellian', 'parody', 'total', 'institution', 'way', 'evil', 'individuals', 'can', 'abuse', 'power', 'crush', 'spirit', 'implications', 'limited', 'arena', 'set', 'quot', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'quot', 'other', 'hand', 'story', 'healing', 'how', 'damaged', 'individual', 'case', 'Susannah', 'played', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'can', 'move', 'fighting', 'institution', 'using', 'resources', 'transform', 'wholer', 'healtheir', 'human', 'being.The', 'strength', 'film', 'acting', 'Yes', 'are', 'cliches', 'why', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'story', 'quite', 'well', 'spite', 'Jolie', 'Lisa', 'Ryder', 'Susannah', 'are', 'two', 'poles', 'film', 'narrative', 'spins', 'Lisa', 'spectacularly', 'disturbed', 'charismatic', 'figure', 'whom', 'Ryder', 'quieter', 'initially', 'terrified', 'character', 'drawn', 'moth', 'flame', 'many', 'moths', 'learn', 'flames', 'can', 'burn', 'Lisa', 'energy', 'ultimately', 'destructive', 'film', 'turning', 'point', 'when', 'Susannah', 'finally', 'Lisa', 'actions', 'have', 'destroyed', 'character', 'devatstating', 'event', 'forces', 'Susannah', 'reassess', 'friend', 'surroundings', 'make', 'active', 'choice', 'get', 'well.As', 'noted', 'strength', 'film', 'performances', 'Jolie', 'acting', 'flashier', 'befits', 'character', 'Ryder', 'acting', 'more', 'subtle', 'being', 'terrified', 'newcomer', 'ward', 'one', 'gang', 'finally', 'young', 'woman', 'be', 'released', 'can', 'see', 'changes', 'amount', 'physical', 'space', 'Ryder', 'fill', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'amazing', 'not', 'false', 'note', 'here', 'lesser', 'movie', 'minor', 'characters', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'mattered', 'much', 'quot', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'quot', 'characters', 'created', 'supporting', 'actors', 'actresses', 'contribute', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'success', 'do', 'Ryder', 'Jolie']",N/A

In typical &quot;let's-make-a-star&quot; fashion, the Angelina Jolie bandwagon has kicked into high gear, enough to generate an Oscar for her portrayal of your typical bad-girl-with-good-heart character in this film (despite SO many more worthy supporting turns this year).  And, as usual when compared with Jolie, no one else is quite given any credit.  The only reason to give this film a try is to watch the rest of the supporting cast.  When they are onscreen, this otherwise typical tale of finding oneself comes alive...and unfortunately, those moments are far too brief and few and far between. Winona Ryder is far more impressive than Jolie in her portrayal of an unsick girl who is labeled because she is indecisive.  It is her character that is worth caring about in this film, not Jolie's, who is entirely one-dimensional here.  You can see her &quot;Great Change&quot; coming a mile away.

15320,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,0767819586,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[4, 9]","I guess this is a teen girl film or something, but here is my utterly valueless opinion not being one:Flaw one:  what's the point?  A girl commits herself to an institution.  Winona Ryder acts crazy, Angelina  Jolie acts crazy, they all act crazy....but isn't that what real  &quot;crazy&quot; people do:  ACT crazy?  Basically the people in  institutions are playing the game that the doctors set up for them; they  accept their diagnosis as legitimate, take the prescribed psychotropic  drugs and electroshock and indulge their &quot;illness&quot; as an excuse  to vegitate.  Basically there is no such thing as mental illness and this  film, though unintentionally, drives that fact home.Winona Rider  is the &quot;good&quot; luny while Angelina Jolie is the &quot;bad&quot;  luny and they are all playing the game of being suicidal as the doctors  indulge their patients' mind games.  This scenario set in the 1960's has 2  scenes of infinite irony:  One, the cab driver says if Rider's character  needs to be committed for seeing things then John Lennon does too.  2: her  boyfriend comes to take her away to Canada where he's going to avoid the  draft.  He really drives the nail into this whole mental illness game and  speaks the truth to Rider's character: you're not crazy. Who are these  people to say who's normal...indeed.The rest of the film is  predictable overly sentimental soap opera.  There is no depth to the  psychology of the characters; believe it or not they consider watching  &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; to be some secret communal nirvana experience.  That's as deep as it goes.  Also a word on setting consistency:  watch  the scene when money is displayed; though the director uses 1960's cars, he  doesn't notice the obvious--the big faced 1990s bills are used for a scene  supposedly set in the 1960s.  But don't worry; to let you know what era it  is they show the totally irrelevant (to this film) King assassination.  Finally a note on the acting.  The easiest thing in the world is to act  like someone who's stupid or crazy.  They act crazy pretty well, acting as  if stupidity were a virtue.  For a much better true story showing the abuse  of psychiatry see the film, Francis, starring Jessica Lange.",2,"Too Sentimental, No Depth, Bad Acting, Many Flaws",961027200,"06 15, 2000",2000,2238,"['guess', 'teen', 'girl', 'film', 'something', 'here', 'utterly', 'valueless', 'opinion', 'not', 'being', 'one', 'Flaw', 'one', 'what', 'point', 'girl', 'institution', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'crazy', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'crazy', 'act', 'crazy', '.but', ""n't"", 'what', 'real', 'quot', 'crazy', 'quot', 'people', 'do', 'ACT', 'crazy', 'Basically', 'people', 'institutions', 'are', 'playing', 'game', 'doctors', 'set', 'up', 'accept', 'diagnosis', 'legitimate', 'take', 'prescribed', 'psychotropic', 'drugs', 'electroshock', 'indulge', 'quot', 'illness', 'quot', 'excuse', 'vegitate', 'Basically', 'such', 'thing', 'mental', 'illness', 'film', 'unintentionally', 'fact', 'home.Winona', 'Rider', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'quot', 'bad', 'quot', 'are', 'playing', 'game', 'being', 'suicidal', 'doctors', 'indulge', 'patients', 'mind', 'games', 'scenario', 'set', '1960', '2', 'scenes', 'infinite', 'irony', 'One', 'cab', 'driver', 'Rider', 'character', 'be', 'committed', 'seeing', 'things', 'then', 'John', 'Lennon', 'too', '2', 'boyfriend', 'take', 'away', 'Canada', 'where', 'going', 'avoid', 'draft', 'really', 'nail', 'whole', 'mental', 'illness', 'game', 'truth', 'Rider', 'character', ""'re"", 'not', 'crazy', 'Who', 'are', 'people', 'say', 'who', 'normal', 'indeed.The', 'rest', 'film', 'predictable', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'soap', 'opera', 'depth', 'psychology', 'characters', 'believe', 'not', 'consider', 'watching', 'quot', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'quot', 'be', 'secret', 'communal', 'nirvana', 'experience', 'as', 'deep', 'Also', 'word', 'setting', 'consistency', 'watch', 'scene', 'when', 'money', 'displayed', 'director', '1960', 'cars', ""n't"", 'notice', 'obvious', 'big', 'faced', '1990s', 'bills', 'are', 'used', 'scene', 'supposedly', 'set', '1960s', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'era', 'show', 'totally', 'irrelevant', 'film', 'King', 'assassination', 'Finally', 'note', 'acting', 'easiest', 'thing', 'world', 'act', 'someone', 'who', 'stupid', 'crazy', 'act', 'crazy', 'pretty', 'well', 'acting', 'stupidity', 'were', 'virtue', 'much', 'better', 'true', 'story', 'showing', 'abuse', 'psychiatry', 'see', 'film', 'Francis', 'starring', 'Jessica', 'Lange']",N/A

Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie are pure gold in their performances here. Even Brittany Murphy is completely frigthening as Daisy, a young patient with anorexia who's ""addicted"" to her dad's chicken. James Mangold is a great director, he also directed Identity, Copland, Kate and Leopold, and the most recent, Walk the Line. I love everyting about this film, great set design, terrific script, and the film is based on a true story. My favorite scene is when Lisa (Jolie) confronts Daisy in her house. Jolie received a best supporting oscar but she is practically in this film as much as Ryder's character, Suzanna Kaysen. Ryder is a tremendous and i was very disappointed she did not get a nomination for best actress. Suzanna attempts suicide and is placed in a woman's ward for the mentally disturbed, along the way she becomes friends with many of her fellow patients, a soicopath, a burn victim, a couple of anorexics, and a pathological liar played elegantly by Clea Duvall. Suzanna is diagnosed with a boderline personality disorder, as she tries to understand her disorder she learns to trust others and herself, and must find a way to do what she has dreamed of doing her whole life and that is to be a writer. Girl, Interrupted is gutsy, real, and heartbreakingly sad.

15329,A13NM1PES9OXVN,0767819586,"Angela Mitchell ""Angela Mitchell""","[0, 1]","I enjoyed &quot;Girl,&quot; which offers some really wonderful performances by Angelina Jolie, Brittany Murphy, and Whoopi Goldberg, but at the same time it was kind of annoying. Why?  Because it's not really a story worth telling -- it's about a main character who's not nuts in any way, who doesn't belong where she is, but who's there out of apathy and boredom.  Because of this, the movie never feels on-kilter.  The alternate title for this film could have been &quot;How I went slumming for a few years in a mental institution for kicks.&quot;Meanwhile, the script is competent, the direction is competent, the photography's beautiful, and the soundtrack is lovely.  It's not a bad movie, just a self-important one (the overdramatic voiceover track combined with some really annoying jump-cuts don't help either).Angelina Jolie is great as the psychopathic Lisa, but it's her quiet moments, not her loud ones, that sold me on her Oscar.  The film is worth seeing, but really doesn't deal with 'real' mental illness above Jolie's hot-cold Lisa, and a bit part by the really wonderful Brittany Murphy, as a girl who hides chicken bones under her bed, as well as a pretty yucky little secret.  Ryder is quiet and thoughtful and provides an interesting counterpoint to all of Jolie's seething and histrionics.Overall though, it's as if Ryder, as good as she is in this, does get bogged down in the occasional overdramatic stare.  On the other hand, she always seems to be sending us a covert wink, just to make sure we know she's not &quot;really&quot; crazy.

15330,A2K5EKS4FE0WMF,0767819586,angela vesey,"[1, 2]","Synopsis: Girl Interrupted is about what society deems psychotic or not. Based in the 60's, Suzanna Kaysen downs a bottle of Aspirin with a bottle of vodka. This lands her in an institute where she meets other patients seeking psychiatric help.Comment: Suzanna Kaysen suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder. This is a more mild form of psychosis because everyone is Borderline to one degree. People are emotionally extreme at times, contrasting, filled with morbid thoughts, maybe self-deprecating at times, perhaps promiscuous. But to have a DISORDER means that you lose control of your emotions more often. You lapse into self-hatred more intensely every time, you lose sight of the origins of emotions, and act our irrationally, physically and emotionally subjecting yourself and others to harm. Observed symptoms are promiscuity, difficulties trusting people, but those that you do trust become an emotional crutch. Highs and lows are extremely intense, and you are so afraid of rejection that you push people away quite unexpectedly. The characteristics are only a disorder when you lose sight of reality, your mind flashes to the past constantly, everything is enhanced, and harmful tendencies occur.  ""Being crazy, is being yourself...amplified""This movie rings true in dealing with Borderline Personality Disorder though its subject matter is still obscure. It also does an exceptional job in describing the experience in a psychiatric institute as well as the range of emotions that is experienced during the interaction and the development of affection among the patients.Visually stunning, informative and insightful, the story of Suzanna Kaysen has been glamorized for entertainment purposes. Before critiquing the movie's accuracy on psychosis, keep an opened mind to the varying degrees of insanity that exists.

I was a bit disappointed in that they chose to have  Angelina's character so over the top.  She is a good actress, and could  have handled more depth to her character.  You never really saw what drove  her.  I recognize that this was to illustrate her dominating character and  maybe to keep focus on Winona's character.  However, Angelina's character  was a counterpoint to Winona's and could have been used to show how the  balance of power was changing.  Winona Ryder played a girl  institutionalized by her own hand.  Ironically, this was because her  parents told her to do so and could not have done so without her  cooperation.  She is pulled by many people and it shows she is recovering  when she says &quot;No&quot; to a boyfriend when he asks her to run away  with him. This young woman's illness was giving too many people control  over her life and her only control (or so she thought) was to end that  life.  Her acting was spectacular and very subtle.  Her big brown eyes  conveyed all the levels of emotion she was feeling.  It was a good movie  and illustrates that some &quot;mental illnesses&quot; are in many ways  environmentally triggered, which is all more the pity.

15341,AJOR7D8TIH3R4,0767819586,bert1761,"[6, 13]","I found &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; to be shallow and cliche, so much so that it borders on offensive.  A &quot;feel-good&quot; movie about life in a mental hospital, &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; trivializes the real-life  experience of these characters and other people suffering from mental  illness.  It is not clear whether Winona Ryder's character is ill -- does  she suffer from a borderline personality disorder, or is she merely a  confused adolescent going through a particularly bad case of &quot;growing  pains&quot; on the border to womanhood. And Angelina Jolie plays a  sociopath that, notwithstanding her behavior in two scenes, is charming and  lovable.  While such is the effect that the sociopathic disorder enables  its sufferers to have on others, in the end they should not be beloved.  Nor is the disorder such that a redemptive breakthrough can come from one  episode of &quot;tough love.&quot;Whether Angelina Jolie deserved the  Oscar for her performance in this role has been the subject of many  reviewers' discussions.  While I think the answer is ultimately  &quot;No&quot; -- Chloe Sevigny should have won for her brilliantly nuanced  performance in &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; -- it is not difficult to see why  she did win.  The woman has that ineffable charisma that draws all  attention to her whenever she is on the screen.  Very few currently working  performers have that quality -- Julia Roberts, Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan  Sarandon and Leonardo DiCaprio are the only other names that come quickly  to mind.  But that quality is not necessarily acting; of the other actors  mentioned above, only Ms. Pfeiffer and Ms. Sarandon give consistently good  performances.  In addition, Ms. Jolie appears to play a character in  &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; who shares many characteristics with the  Angelina Jolie described in current tv entertainment magazine shows and  tabloid reports.  Only time will tell whether she can really act or whether  she is merely a mesmerizing bad girl.Notwithstanding my distgaste for  the movie, I believe that director James Mangold may actually have made a  good movie and ruined it with some bad editing decisions.

Winona Ryder gives her finest performance to date as real-life Susanna Kaysen, whose experiences in a private mental institution during the late sixties were the subject of her highly successful autobiography ""Girl, Interrupted"". Director James Mangold (Heavy, Copland) has done a fine job in fashioning a fluid narrative from a very sketchy character study, and his work is effective most when he emphasizes telling the story from within the main character's point of view. Ryder's realizations throughout the film are so moving that they make a somewhat predictable story into a very memorable one; her first major step in facing her problem while standing in the middle of the parking lot with draft dodger boyfriend Toby (Jared Leto) is probably the most heartbreaking scene in the whole film for me.  The supporting cast is not to be overlooked, however, since one doesn't watch the film without first mentioning the highly praised support offered by Angelina Jolie as Lisa, the sociopath who has been in the institution for eight years and doesn't show signs of being released any time soon. Others in the ensemble include Clea DuVall as pathological liar Georgina, Elisabeth Moss (remember her as Baby Louise in Bette Midler's version of Gypsy?) as burn victim Polly, and, most disturbingly, Clueless' Brittany Murphy as Daisy, a girl with so many secrets and so many mental disturbances it would ruinous of your viewing experience for me to mention them all (she really got under my skin, I can't help but tell you). To top it all off, there's a beautiful and sensitive performance by Whoopi Goldberg as Valerie, the wise nurse who recognizes Susanna's extraordinary intelligence and uses it to help steer her in the right direction. Goldberg's performances in dramas tend to always be wise and sensitive and beautiful (Corrina, Corrina being an expert example), but here she's even more memorable than she's ever been. I won't even begin to talk about the contribution made by Vanessa Redgrave's two small scenes because then this article would never end. Suffice it to say that though it's not the most groundbreaking piece of storytelling ever to have hit your VCR, it certainly has a lot of truth to it, and a lot of wisdom worth taking away with you.",4,Very touching drama,971740800,"10 17, 2000",2000,2580,"['audience', 'members', 'might', 'find', 'all-girl', 'version', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'be', 'unsatisfactory', 'overly', 'glossy', 'when', 'closely', 'examined', 'carefully', 'observed', 'film', 'delicate', 'touching', 'portrayal', 'adolescent', 'unhappiness', 'difficulties', 'finding', 'place', 'very', 'crazy', 'world', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'finest', 'performance', 'date', 'real-life', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'experiences', 'private', 'mental', 'institution', 'late', 'sixties', 'were', 'subject', 'highly', 'successful', 'autobiography', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'Director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'Heavy', 'Copland', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'fashioning', 'fluid', 'narrative', 'very', 'sketchy', 'character', 'study', 'work', 'effective', 'most', 'when', 'telling', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'point', 'view', 'Ryder', 'realizations', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'moving', 'make', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'story', 'very', 'memorable', 'one', 'first', 'major', 'step', 'facing', 'problem', 'standing', 'middle', 'parking', 'lot', 'draft', 'dodger', 'boyfriend', 'Toby', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'probably', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'whole', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'however', 'one', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'first', 'mentioning', 'highly', 'praised', 'support', 'offered', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Lisa', 'sociopath', 'who', 'been', 'institution', 'eight', 'years', ""n't"", 'show', 'signs', 'being', 'released', 'time', 'soon', 'Others', 'ensemble', 'include', 'Clea', 'DuVall', 'pathological', 'liar', 'Georgina', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'remember', 'Baby', 'Louise', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'version', 'Gypsy', 'burn', 'victim', 'Polly', 'most', 'disturbingly', 'Clueless', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Daisy', 'girl', 'so', 'many', 'secrets', 'so', 'many', 'mental', 'disturbances', 'would', 'ruinous', 'viewing', 'experience', 'mention', 'really', 'got', 'skin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'tell', 'top', 'off', 'beautiful', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Valerie', 'wise', 'nurse', 'who', 'Susanna', 'extraordinary', 'intelligence', 'help', 'steer', 'right', 'direction', 'Goldberg', 'performances', 'dramas', 'tend', 'always', 'be', 'wise', 'sensitive', 'beautiful', 'Corrina', 'Corrina', 'being', 'expert', 'example', 'here', 'even', 'more', 'memorable', 'ever', 'been', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'talk', 'contribution', 'made', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'two', 'small', 'scenes', 'then', 'article', 'would', 'never', 'end', 'Suffice', 'say', 'not', 'most', 'groundbreaking', 'piece', 'storytelling', 'ever', 'have', 'hit', 'VCR', 'certainly', 'lot', 'truth', 'lot', 'wisdom', 'taking', 'away']",N/A

15355,AK2Q9IQPSTRDU,0767819586,Chen,"[2, 3]","This was one review that was hard for me to write. I saw this movie a while ago, but I couldn't write a review for lack of anything to write. Not that there was nothing to write about this movie-just that everything sounded wrong. After I kept telling myself I'd write a review &quot;later&quot;, I decided it's either now or never. So here goes.Angelina Jolie of course one an Oscar for her great preformance as Lisa Rowe, the hearltess wacko. It's every actors, or actresses, dream to play crazy, because everyone knows how hard it is to play without looking overdone or lame, and if you're a good actor everyone stands up and takes notice of you in a role like this. Which is what happened to Jolie. But what about the other great actors in the movie? Winona Ryder plays Susanna Kaysen, who at eightteen lands in a pyscatric center after a suicide attempt. There she gets diagonosed with &quot;borderline personality&quot;. She also befriends some unusual girls: her roomate Georgina (Clea DuVall, great!), who is in for lyring and is obsessed with the Wizard of Oz; Daisy (Brittany Murphy), who keeps fried chicken onder her bed;and Polly (Elisabeth Moss, who burned her face as a little girl.This movie is one I relate to, yet I haven't been diagonsed with a mental illness (yet). But then, you hasn't ever felt themselves slipping maddness? Who hasn't confused dreams with reality? Who hasn't ever been blue? Who hasn't ever thought they were crazy and needed to be saved? Maybe that's you, reading the review... but somehow I don't think so. And yeah, if you've never felt that... I have a feeling you will.Now, this movie is a true story you now, based on the book. I have yet to read the book but I'm looking into it.

15356,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,0767819586,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[2, 4]","Winona Ryder is far from my favorite actress.  I can praise her work in films like Beetle Juice, Lucas  and Edward Scissorhands, but I must utterly dismiss her for lackluster performances in films like Age of Innocence and Aliens 4.  In Girl Interrupted Ryder is quite good, but the film is a mixed bag that is dominated by an almost over-the-top, though affecting performance by Angelie Jolie (as Lisa).  Her performance is the type of take no prisoners work which sometimes is richly rewarded by the Oscar folks (and of course, was).  It's also the reason to keep watching this film which offers nothing particularly new, but might connect and offer some solace to those who have ever felt alienated by not playing by someone else's idea of the rules.The film features folks in supporting roles like Whoopie Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave who aren't given much to do and therefore act like they are picking up a check for a t.v. movie of the week.I don't fault them so much for that, because much of Girl Interrupted feels very much like a t.v. movie of the week or an Afterschool Special.  It plays sometimes like a softer, gentler, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.What I really fault the film for is in it's numerous continuity errors.  I mean glaringly obvious ones that make me wonder if anyone other than Ryder cared as deeply for this project as we've been led to believe.  Supposedly (and I've no reason to disbelieve it) Ryder worked for nearly 7 years to hold onto this project and see that it was brought it to the screen with the care and reverence she felt it deserved.  To insure this, she became one of the producers of the project and probably partially financed the rights to the book and most likely sacrificed her normal star salary.The book is written as a string of vignettes, and author Susanna Kayson has a prose voice for capturing small personal details. The vignettes and thoughts add up to make a very affecting book, but the book doesn't have a strong narrative.  To make a film of the book a more conventional narrative was needed.  This narrative could have sharply skewered psychiatry, or become a feminist One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, creating some evil psychiatrist or Nurse Ratchet character.To it's credit the film doesn't do this.  It stays truer to the source material than that.  When some rich parents can't communicate with their children, they sometimes let psychiatric hospitals do their work for them.  And that's essentially the story that is told here.The hospital is not a Snake Pit kind of place.  But it is a cold, and sometimes heartless institution. The movie makes the point that one of the main reasons Kaysen was committed to McLean was her possible promiscuity, and her depression which ended with a half hearted suicide attempt involving aspirin and vodka.  Men have rarely been considered mentally disturbed for their promiscuity .The film also to its credit doesn't romanticize insanity either.  We meet characters who are troubled without thinking they are very `cool' or destined to be artistic outcasts.  Yet we don't have anyone who warrants our sympathy in terms of a central character.  After all, Kaysen admitted herself to the institution, and its clear she was smart enough to pretty quickly play the game well enough to get herself released if she decided it was better dealing with the turbulent 1960's on the outside, then the cold instutionalism of a high class mental institution. And Ryder's performances is quiet and even.  She let's Jolie as Lisa and some of the other characters over-emote around her. That's to her credit on the one hand, but it doesn't help us as audience members to care all that much about her.As the central figure of film, rather than as the narrator of the book, Kaysen is who we are most focused on.  And she is the least troubled of nearly anyone we meet.  We know she's in pretty good shape and in fact becomes a surrogate big sister to some of the other in-mates in the institution.  So where's the suspenseful conflict?  We know there isn't a really big problem, and we know she isn't in any great danger.  Some of the other characters clearly have some major issues, but we don't get to know or care very much about them.And then there are the continuity errors to really bother those who are paying attention. There are a couple of scenes where you'll see Ryder as Kaysen lighting a cigarette and smoking and then a few moments later, lighting another cigarette.  She's rarely without a cigarette but to show her constantly lighting up cigarettes is pretty ridiculous, particularly since in one case she's in the back of a cab, and if she were rapidly chain-smoking, the cab would be thick with smoke, which it isn't.Another one that really bothered me, was later in the film, (and so as not spoil anything I won't go into great details about what else is going in), we learn Angelina Jolie as the sociopath Lisa really despises cats.  A cat that  follows Ryder out for a walk, but when she returns, the cat is inside the apartment where Lisa (Jolie) is.  Lisa wouldn't have let the cat back in-she hates cats.. it's a mistake and mistakes happen but this film is full of continuity errors, which shows a real sloppiness on the director, and editors part.I couldn't help but think of times of Jack Arnold's cult campy classic Switchblade Sisters when Angeline Jolie as Lisa was on screen.  She's chewing the scenery in a barely disguised variation on a bad girl from reform school type of performaance which would have been right at home in a 50's juvie film or a 70's woman in prison film.And I couldn't help thinking that although parts of Girl Interrupted are well done, and well acted,I would have much rather been watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or even Switchblade Sisters, then this film.Chris Jarmick Author of The Glass Cocoon  with Serena F.

I missed it in the theater, but I am kind of glad I did; I think that by seeing this film at home in the  comfort of my living room only enhanced the film. Of course, as you can see  from reading the other reviews, a very strong aspect of this movie is the  acting. I feel that every single actor-be it minor or major-did an  absolutely stunning job in emphasizing the point of this film.I have  always admired Winona Ryder, who, paradoxically, brings subtlety and  boldness into her performances. To paraphrase the director, James Mangold,  she is a great silent actress. Every look, every slight expression, every  line of dialogue colors her character. And there is the peerless Angelina  Jolie. I don't think anyone else could have played Lisa. She has this great  electricity and energy about her. Her performance is a great inspiration.  Her Academy Award was definitely well-deserved. I hope she continues to  choose projects that challenge her and bring out her best performance. I  was happy to see Vanessa Redgrave in the film - what a great actress, as is  Brittany Murphy, who plays Daisy.The story is wonderful, the dialogue  often humorous and touching, the performances riveting!

The irony that amongst her words spoken in the film: (""Have you ever stolen something that you could completely afford to pay for?) appear, in real life, to have slowed down her career, seems unreasonably unfair. She is a great artist and one day hopefully will have an Oscar of her own. I feel she should have been nominated for this film, as should have Whoopi Goldberg, in quite a small but emotionally rich role. In addition, Vanessa Redgrave, though seen on film here for what has to be not quite 5 minutes, leaves an incredible impact, that, too could have been Oscar nominated, as supporting actress. Ms. Jolie deserved her Oscar, though i do feel she and Ms. Ryder should have shared Best (Lead) Actress nominations with Jolie winning, and Ms. Goldberg and Redgrave in the supporting catagory- The ensemble cast is terrific, too many to name, and as a 'period piece' the film really does give the viewer the feeling they are watching a slice of life from 1968 and 1969, the 'timespace' of the movie.It belongs in homes of people who love to study great acting, because the film is loaded with it.  Time to forgive Ms. Ryder's shopping habits- no-one's perfect-  and realize it was she who was instrumental in getting the film made in the first place and also time to admire Ryder for having the artistic integrity to give the 'showier' role to Ms. Jolie, who should repay the favor anytime soon now and give the talented Ms. Ryder a role in one of Jolie's films.

I will openly admit that the first watching was for a glimpse Jolie's beauty, and her role in this film somehwat prohibits that.  Watching for the second time, this time around for the pure acting and or story line and theres much more to report.  If ever an actress deserved an award more than Jolie here please let me know.  She NAILED her performance in everyway, outshining Ryder by a long shot and proving that she is by far one of the most talented leading ladies around.  Lisa (Jolie's charactor) is the most interesting person on screen, her soul is captured by Jolie's passion for her art here and you feel attached to her, just as Susanna (Ryder) is throughout this film...The film is actually someone mellow-dramatic when Jolie is not around.  This film has an air of sadness about it as you see these girls and how their lives are destroyed by their illnesses...a young girl with burn scares almost brought me to tears when she's crying and screaming about being ugly...and when Ryder and Jolie sing her to sleep...it's heart breaking...as is one of the final scenes when Ryder confronts Jolie with her true feelings.  This is a great film that shouldn't be missed, and is full of great performances by actresses that don't deliver normally like Brittney Murphy who soars in her performance here.

15367,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0767819586,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","What can you say, really?  Girl, Interrupted is just a magnificent motion picture boasting some awe-inspiring performances by Winona Rider, the incomparable Angelina Jolie (who definitely earned those best supporting actress awards), Whoopi Goldberg, and virtually everyone else in the film.  The motion picture easily rises above the constraints that threatened to clip its wings - it's not a chick flick, and it is absolutely not a female version of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.  It's a powerful story that touches a spot somewhere in the hearts of each of us, as we are all crazy down deep inside.  Most people hide it or rob it of its power by ignoring it, but what happened to Susanna Kaysen could happen to any one of us - life becomes sad and confusing, time threatens to overpower us, bad things refuse to remain below the surface, etc.  Indeed, after watching the film, it is difficult to say whether Susanna was ever crazy or not.  I would go out on a limb and say the same of Lisa: she's a sociopath, but she lives in a world free of masks, uninhibited by the moral precepts of society, unafraid to not only examine the truth but spit in its eye, empowered by a sense of freedom that no mental institution can take away from her.  She is a much more fascinating creature than Susanna, a roaring flame of spirit compared to Susanna's dark husk of existence.  That is why we are drawn to her; Lisa has an excess of the vivacity so many of us long for in our own lives.This film was based on the true story of Susanna Kaysen.  As the director explains in the commentary, the screenplay does diverge from the book on several occasions, but it seeks to communicate the essence and insights of Kaysen's experience.  I can't compare the two, as I haven't read the book, but this movie definitely has a lot to show us about life, ourselves, and those around us.  We basically follow Susanna's tragic yet empowering experience in the institution right along with her, seeing everything and everyone through her eyes.  At first, she naturally rebels, lamenting the fact she is basically stuck in a place surrounded by crazy people, but she soon comes to develop complex but very real bonds with her fellow patients - even Lisa, who basically scared the dickens out of her when she first arrived.  Her life in the institution, the traumatic episodes she witnesses among the other girls, and her own inner struggle to face up to her own problems must be experienced, so I will not attempt to describe them here.  From laughter to sadness, it all rings true and seems incredibly real.It's no secret that Angelina Jolie pretty much steals the show with her magnetic performance as Lisa, but she is only one star in a constellation of great performers on display here.  Rider is superb and would seem to be the perfect if not the only actress to play Susanna.  Brittany Murphy is also incredible as Daisy, the most tragic character to come out of the story.  It is amazing to watch someone with the incredible vivacity of Murphy deliver such a subtle, emotionally vulnerable performance.  And then there's Whoopi.  I really don't like Whoopi Goldberg, but I have to admit she is really an incredibly gifted actress.  The warmth and oftentimes unstated compassion she shows to the girls in her ward is really one of the most important foundations of this entire movie.The DVD features some nice special features.  The commentary by director James Mangold is very beneficial to the viewer, as he fills in some of the gaps between the actual true story and the screenplay of the film.  I certainly would not have guessed that he structured much of the film around the motifs of The Wizard of Oz - it is fascinating, not to mention really weird, to hear him go on and on with comparisons between the two films.  You also get some sixteen minutes of deleted scenes with or without director's commentary - these provide a little more insight into our characters, but I would agree that they were better left on the cutting room floor.  The obligatory HBO First Look feature on the making of the film gives the viewer a chance to hear from cast members as well as Susanna Kaysen herself.  These special features are just icing on the cake, though, as Girl, Interrupted is easily one of the most impressive and emotionally complex films to hit the big screen in many years.",5,"Mesmerizing, emotionally powerful, and unforgettable",1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,4365,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'really', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'just', 'magnificent', 'motion', 'picture', 'boasting', 'awe-inspiring', 'performances', 'Winona', 'Rider', 'incomparable', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'who', 'definitely', 'earned', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'awards', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'motion', 'picture', 'easily', 'constraints', 'threatened', 'clip', 'wings', 'not', 'chick', 'flick', 'absolutely', 'not', 'female', 'version', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'powerful', 'story', 'spot', 'somewhere', 'hearts', 'are', 'crazy', 'down', 'deep', 'inside', 'Most', 'people', 'hide', 'rob', 'power', 'ignoring', 'what', 'happened', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'could', 'happen', 'one', 'life', 'sad', 'confusing', 'time', 'threatens', 'overpower', 'bad', 'things', 'refuse', 'remain', 'surface', 'etc', 'Indeed', 'watching', 'film', 'difficult', 'say', 'Susanna', 'was', 'ever', 'crazy', 'not', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'say', 'same', 'Lisa', 'sociopath', 'world', 'free', 'masks', 'uninhibited', 'moral', 'precepts', 'society', 'unafraid', 'not', 'only', 'examine', 'truth', 'spit', 'eye', 'empowered', 'sense', 'freedom', 'mental', 'institution', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'much', 'more', 'fascinating', 'creature', 'Susanna', 'roaring', 'flame', 'spirit', 'compared', 'Susanna', 'dark', 'husk', 'existence', 'why', 'are', 'drawn', 'Lisa', 'excess', 'vivacity', 'so', 'many', 'long', 'own', 'lives.This', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'director', 'commentary', 'screenplay', 'diverge', 'book', 'several', 'occasions', 'communicate', 'essence', 'insights', 'Kaysen', 'experience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'definitely', 'lot', 'show', 'life', 'basically', 'follow', 'Susanna', 'tragic', 'yet', 'empowering', 'experience', 'institution', 'right', 'along', 'seeing', 'everything', 'everyone', 'eyes', 'first', 'naturally', 'rebels', 'lamenting', 'fact', 'basically', 'stuck', 'place', 'surrounded', 'crazy', 'people', 'soon', 'develop', 'complex', 'very', 'real', 'bonds', 'fellow', 'patients', 'even', 'Lisa', 'who', 'basically', 'scared', 'dickens', 'when', 'first', 'arrived', 'life', 'institution', 'traumatic', 'episodes', 'other', 'girls', 'own', 'inner', 'struggle', 'face', 'up', 'own', 'problems', 'must', 'be', 'experienced', 'will', 'not', 'attempt', 'describe', 'here', 'laughter', 'sadness', 'rings', 'true', 'incredibly', 'real.It', 'secret', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'pretty', 'much', 'steals', 'show', 'magnetic', 'performance', 'Lisa', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'constellation', 'great', 'performers', 'display', 'here', 'Rider', 'superb', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'perfect', 'not', 'only', 'actress', 'play', 'Susanna', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'also', 'incredible', 'Daisy', 'most', 'tragic', 'character', 'come', 'story', 'amazing', 'watch', 'someone', 'incredible', 'vivacity', 'Murphy', 'deliver', 'subtle', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'performance', 'then', 'Whoopi', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'have', 'admit', 'really', 'incredibly', 'gifted', 'actress', 'warmth', 'oftentimes', 'unstated', 'compassion', 'girls', 'ward', 'really', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'foundations', 'entire', 'movie.The', 'DVD', 'nice', 'special', 'features', 'commentary', 'director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'very', 'beneficial', 'viewer', 'gaps', 'actual', 'true', 'story', 'screenplay', 'film', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'guessed', 'structured', 'much', 'film', 'motifs', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'fascinating', 'not', 'mention', 'really', 'weird', 'hear', 'go', 'comparisons', 'two', 'films', 'also', 'get', 'sixteen', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'commentary', 'provide', 'little', 'more', 'insight', 'characters', 'would', 'agree', 'were', 'better', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'obligatory', 'HBO', 'First', 'Look', 'feature', 'making', 'film', 'viewer', 'chance', 'hear', 'cast', 'members', 'as', 'well', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'though', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'films', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'many', 'years']",N/A

So, when I see a DVD that has &quot;Oscar nominee&quot; or &quot;Academy Award Winner&quot; and even  &quot;One of the best films of the year!&quot; on the covers, I tend to  say..&quot;yeah, right!  Whatever...&quot;I purchased the DVD of  &quot;GIRL, INTERRUPTED&quot; and one of the driving forces for me to buy  this is for the acting of Winona Ryder (watch her eyes because those  emotions are within the eyes) and Angelina Jolie that is currently the eye  candy for many entertainment magazines at this time.After watching  this movie, I must say that I was actually very pleased with the storyline.  It's actually a very good story and the interaction among the girls was  really interesting.  James Mangold said in the director's commentary that  it was about adding conflict and the conflicts between Susanna and Lisa or  Susanna and her nurse and of course Susanna with Susanna is very well  done.Winona Ryder is a talented actress and again her eyes play a  big part in this movie.  In fact, the HBO First Look: &quot;The Making of  GIRL, INTERRUPTED&quot; goes into that.  As for Angelina Jolie, she did a  perfect job in playing Lisa.  With all the rumors and news going around,  sometimes I wonder if Angelina and Lisa share anything in common.  She  deserves the Academy Award for playing a convincing sociopath.The  video quality of the movie is pretty good but there are noticeable  artifacts during the dark scenes.  The audio is good and you don't get so  much because it's a dialogue driven movie.  I think the only time I heard  sounds from the speakers is when they rode on the VW van and you hear the  engine.What about the extras?  Well, first, let's be thankful  they made it anamorphic and they included the director's commentary,  deleted scenes and an isolated music score.  The HBO making of is very  interesting to watch and the theatrical trailers for Winona and Angelina's  movies were a nice touch.So, overall you get a pretty good DVD  with a pretty good story.

This really isn't a tear-jerker as such, it's just that the material and the way it is handled made me feel such affection for those girls struggling so hard to be whole.  Set in New England in the sixties with Vietnam in the background and free love in the streets, this is a fine film with an excellent cast that tells an original story without mawkish sentimentality or any pandering to the politically correct.  The psychotherapeutic industry is not indicted, nor is society held over the coals.  Everything is individual and the faults and failures are individual faults and failures, and the ultimate redemption or lack there of is also individual.Winona Ryder gives a striking performance as 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen, writer-to-be who finds herself in a mental institution after a suicide attempt.  Ryder, who has the expressive face of a silent film star,  proves beyond any doubt that she is a gifted and hard working actress (or at least was when this film was made in 1998).  Trickster Angelina Jolie is fascinating in her academy-award winning supporting role as a kind of femme bad boy.  Whoopi Goldberg as a Nurse Ratched with a heart, anchors the film and brings strength and rationality to the lives of the girls.  Vanessa Redgrave, elegant and wise as Dr. Wick, a shrink with compassion and intelligence, serves as a counterbalance to Jeffrey Tambor's incompetent Dr. Potts.Some have compared this to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) but this is an entirely different kind of movie.  It has neither the range nor the outrageous humor of that great film.  Director James Mangold, whose much admired Heavy (1995) showed what he can do, wisely attempts less here as he concentrates on the personal journey Susanna Kaysen takes to the brink of institutionalized insanity and back.  He emphasizes how people can bond and show affection under dysfunctional circumstances, and how we can triumph over the darker aspects of our nature.

What he should have never been allowed to touch was the original script.He whittled many of the important supporting characters down to anecdotes, and focused much too strongly on the lack of story between Susanna(Winona Ryder) and her nurse, Valerie(Whoopi Goldberg), and therapists(Jeffrey Tambor and a wasted Vanessa Redgrave).The film should have been very much an ensemble piece. When not in one two-character relationship, the Lisa(Angelina Jolie)-Susanna duo being the strongest, he spits out one-liners and stereotypes for his incredible players to show.Jillian Armenante(Cynthia), Clea DuVall(Georgina), Angela Bettis(Janet), Brittany Murphy(Daisy), and Elisabeth Moss(Polly) are all better actresses than the script shows. Most are left as set dressing, standing in hallways as Susanna and Lisa cavort.The most interesting scenes occur outside the hospital, which is an oversight. The &quot;normal&quot; world in an ice cream shop shows the juxtaposition of insanity Susanna is choosing, with the world she is supposed to be within. Daisy's apartment is also a drama-packed den of emotion and catharsis as Susanna and Lisa spend the night.Mangold should have kept his mangling mitts off this one.potential: 10/10*final product: 6/10DVD notes: as per all recent Mangold releases, there is ample commentary by the director, giving insights into the film locations, casting, and motivation.

Winona Ryder plays Susanna, who is being placed in a mental hospital after  taking an entire bottle of aspirin with vodka. Her diagnosis, Borderline  Personality Disorder, is never proved, but she spends one year of her life  in Claymore Mental Hospital. While there, she befriends many of the  residents, including the rebellious Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie.  Throughout the course of her stay, as Susanna's friendships grow deeper,  her will to escape becomes distant, as does her compliance with the rules  of the institution. She soon comes to a realization that she must look  inside of herself and discover what she truly wants: freedom. The story is  based on the novel of the same name, written by the main character Susanna.  Full of heart and emotion, it evokes several different fields of feeling:  levity, heartache, sadness, and hope for the future. The performances by  Ryder and Jolie, especially in the most harrowing moments of the film, will  have you in tears.

I have read that this movie cannot help but be compared to ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, but, having never seen that supposed masterpiece, I had no such encumbrences to my enjoying this magnificent film with my girlfriend.  The magic of this movie to me is not so much in its ability to make a mental institution come alive, but its ability to make the girls in it and their lives and relationships become as real as anyone you've ever met or knew.  There are times when you can't help but feel *God, it must be hard to eke out an existence in a mental hospital and get well in your soul*. But those times immediately set the stage for scenes and dialogues that make you say *God, it must be hard to have been a young woman in 1967* no matter where she was or what she was going through.  That leads to you almost unnoticeably saying in your heart, as Wynona Rider's performance, Good Cop/Bad Copped by the amazing Jolie in this film (with both backed up with incredible supporting characters) enters every corner of your mind: how hard it must be at times to be a young woman, whose soul is scarred while on the verge of discovering who she is, anywhere, in any way, at anytime.GIRL, INTERRUPTED is the profound and poignant story of a woman whose path from girlhood to womanhood, from silly giggle to sexy laugh to wisdom smile, was painfully interrupted- and then had that path take on such unimagineable twists and turns that she would come out with a greater potential for wisdom, peace and love than she otherwise would ever have had.  It is in that context that the mental institution  as a whole becomes a subordinate character like Whoopi Goldberg's as the wise Nurse- in fact, little more than the powerful metaphor the film's title triumphantly is.This is one of those movies that makes you say &quot;Oh, a chick flick with good actresses&quot;  when you read the title, but leaves you deeply touched and pondering its significance as it easily transcends even the compliment inherent in that stereotype when you see it, with powerful dialogue and brilliant ensemble acting.

Instead of  dealing with the situation her parents put Susanna into a private  institution.It's in the institution that she meets Lisa, played with  great fervor by Jolie.  They seemed to have a great chemistry on screen, I  find it hard to believe that they had a hard time getting along off screen.  They sort of play off each other.

The director, James Mangold, cut out so many good scenes in order to shorten the length of this movie.  One  of these scenes gives a reason for calling the movie, &quot;Girl,  Interrrupted&quot;, which I thought should have been left in the film.  But  obviously, the director thought differently.  There are also deleted scenes  that show her Suzanne's attempted suicide &amp; how she came to be in the  hospital.  I felt these scenes would have added much to the movie - so I  was really happy to be able to see them.Winona Ryder &amp; Angelina  Jolie both do such wonderful jobs acting in this movie.  Winona can be so  expressive without even saying one word &amp; I think that her acting in  this movie was overlooked by many critics.  Maybe that was because Angelina  Jolie's performance was so explosive &amp; in-your-face.  Not to say that  it wasn't a great job...it was.

15388,A1CHM200OEN65X,0767819586,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[0, 2]","As a child, do you remember that first time being deeply depressed?  Do you remember finally finding a friend that seemed to understand, seemed to truly connect with your hurt and frustration?&quot;Girl,  Interrupted&quot; rekindled those feelings in me.  Not so much because of  present personal depression, but because it painted the world of questions  and emotion so vividly and, ultimately, so hopefully. Whereas, many artsy  films like to wallow in angst and anger, &quot;Girl,Interrupted&quot; makes  the clear point that those issues can be set aside, overcome, that they can  be a mere interruption in the overall picture of life.Suzanna Kaysen is  a troubled high-school graduate with the sole aspiration to become a  writer--&quot;But what are you going to do?&quot; her counselor asks.  When  she succumbs to the angst of the Sixties, she finds herself in the hospital  with a belly full of pills and alcohol, and her parents decide she needs  help, though Kaysen insists she was only trying to get rid of a  headache.Soon, Kaysen is signing herself into a mental hospital, unaware  that she is powerless to sign herself back out.  As she befriends those  around her, she begins to question her own sanity and finds herself in  trouble.  She wants freedom, but she wants the depth of friendship she's  found.  Friendships lead her closer to insanity's brink, and only when she  finds the strength to be herself and be honest, does she find the true  security of deep friendship.Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie dominate  this film with their powerful, subtly-nuanced performances.  Ryder portrays  her conflicting emotions with every twitch of her face, every angle of her  posture, and Jolie is a magnetic force, drawing us in to her side, setting  us up for betrayal and--finally--hope again. Despite my general aversion to  Whoopi Goldberg films, Whoopi plays her role with tender strength and  under-acted power.  Despite some of the mental ward's despicable practices  of it's era, the staff are depicted with depth and  understanding.&quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; addresses the crazy feelings  so many of us struggle with at some point, and makes the strong statement  that these struggles can be overcome, that sanity is within reach, that  life is worth living honestly and deeply.

15389,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0767819586,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 3]","`Girl Interrupted' suffers from comparisons with `One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', perhaps a bit unfairly since they were different kinds of stories.  Possibly the reason for this is that the story presented like  Cuckoo Lite.  This story begged for some character development, especially  of Lisa.  It is essentially a slice of life film.  There was no real plot,  just a succession of incidents at the institution.For a slice of life  film to be successful, there must be character development or situations  that are so unique and fascinating that they compensate for the story's  lacking a plotline.  In `Cuckoo's Nest' despite having little character  development, the situations were intense and Jack Nicholson commanded our  attention in every frame.  G.I. fell short in both areas.  It was  unquestionably an interesting character study of both Suzanna (Winona  Ryder) and Lisa (Angelina Jolie), but the flashbacks of Suzanna's life were  too sketchy to provide much insight into the problems with which she  struggled, and Lisa's past was a total mystery.  Though Jolie's performance  was truly outstanding, as was Ryder's, together they failed to create a  performance strong enough to compensate for what the story  lacked.Director James Mangold gets credit for a story sensitively told  and his direction of the actors was excellent.  This was generally a very  well acted film.  Angelina Jolie continues to impress in difficult and  gutsy roles.  She is a very gritty performer and is fantastic at pouring  out raw emotion with no holds barred.  Hopefully this performance will help  her emerge from the shadows of supporting actor to land the lead she  deserves.Wynona Ryder delivered another mature and powerful performance.  She is quite accomplished at playing complex and tormented characters.  One day, I would love to see her in something that departs from her  accustomed dour roles.  While watching the featurette included on the DVD,  I noticed she actually does possess a genuinely happy smile.  It occurred  to me at that moment that this was the first time I'd seen it.  The only  smile she ever gets a chance to use in character is her wounded smile.I  rated this film a 7/10.  Overall, this film gives us two great  performances, but comes up a little short in the presentation of the story.

If you go into this movie with hopes of it being as good as ""one flew over the cuckoos nest"" your going to be very dissapointed. Unlike ""Cuckoos nest"" this takes a look into the world of the womens mental institution. The intitial premise is great, but the film really lacks the reality of the horrors that went on when the institutions were up and running. If you visit any of the old state wards, you can still see blood on the bars and walls. Stories of ghost are very common; stories of them unable to rest in peace after the terrible experiments and other things that went on. Sure it wasnt that bad all the time, but movies have to be able to have the guts to go a bit over the top to stir emotion. This movie failed to do that the majority of the time. For the most part, the mental institution was more like a girls only country club. The actors did a beautiful job in the film, but the screenplay itself failed to deliver powerful and defined characters like we saw in ""cuckoos nest"".This movie deserves almost 3 stars. I give it credit for trying to do something really special, but it fails to capture emotion and enough attention to want to watch the whole movie. Angelina is great in this film and she has great eyes. Some actors like Jack Nicholson and Gary Busey can play strong characters simply with their eyes; I see some of that in Angelina. She is a wonderful actress and I see big things for her in the future. Its a shame how beautiful women like her are exploited in films that hold her back and dont show her true talent. I give this film credit for letting Angelina show her true talent without getting naked.The extra features in this film are excellent and make the movie better. Great deleted scenes and directors commentary. The VHS version of this movie is deffinetly not worth purchasing, but the DVD is pretty cool.

Due to a suicide attempt, she is sent to a psychiatric institution where she must overcome her mental problems, particularly her &quot;borderline personality&quot;. The thing is, Susana isn`t really that mad or insane, just a tad confused and lost. When she meets her mates in the institution, she starts questioning the world around her and the frontier between sanity and madness. Susana soon develops a tight friendship with Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a clever yet unstable and sometimes ferocious girl.Director James Mangold delivers an intriguing story here, giving a glimpse into the sixties zeitgeist and the generational problems of a youth without strong references and guidance. The plot is not all that original, as it basically combines &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoos` Nest&quot; and &quot;Little Women&quot;, but the acting, dialogue and score make up for some of the plot`s weaknesses.&quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; is a fine drama about becoming an adult and starting to see the world under a new perspective, which indeed can lead to an &quot;ambivalent&quot; state as Susana discovers here. It`s not as risky as it should, since some major problems are handled with a light touch, but overall it has enough depth and complexity to become a meaningful effort.True, the movie has some unecessary cheesy and melodramatic scenes at parts, approaching predictable Hollywood fluff, but fortunately the good moments still outweight the bad ones.

The commentary track by the director is well worth the  time too.  My biggest quibble with the film (aside from the goopy,  sentimental goodbye scenes at the end) is that Ryder's character is  awfully, um, mild as personality disorders go (are we supposed to think  that she's been put in this place by mistake?  Okay, she swallowed some  aspirin and vodka, and had sex a couple of days in a day, but trust me,  Ryder is a Girl Scout compared to most people with Borderline Personality  Disorder which these days is a very specific and detailed diagnosis.  Perhaps this diagnosis was just a catch-all back in the 60s, for people  having kind of a bad day?).  Mangold, in his heartfelt commentary track,  points out many things which you'll be feeling yourself (all in a good way)  when you first watch the film -- the center of gravity that is Goldberg,  the enormous expressiveness of Ryder and her luminous eyes, the homage of  sorts to Michael Powell's Black Narcissus, and especially, how wonderful it  is to watch a film where the director takes time to let things happen and  doesn't edit the whole thing into four second cuts.",4,"Jolie is Fierce, Winona  Wonderful",960768000,"06 12, 2000",2000,1446,"['Well', 'cough', 'hack', 'anyone', 'who', 'spent', 'time', 'locked', 'ward', 'may', 'need', 'put', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'make', 'sure', 'pick', 'up', 'back', 'up', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Ryder', 'Redgrave', 'Goldberg', 'especially', 'star-turn', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'quot', 'good', 'know', 'quot', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'well', 'time', 'too', 'biggest', 'quibble', 'film', 'aside', 'goopy', 'sentimental', 'goodbye', 'scenes', 'end', 'Ryder', 'character', 'awfully', 'um', 'mild', 'personality', 'disorders', 'go', 'are', 'supposed', 'think', 'been', 'put', 'place', 'mistake', 'Okay', 'swallowed', 'aspirin', 'vodka', 'had', 'sex', 'couple', 'days', 'day', 'Ryder', 'Girl', 'Scout', 'compared', 'most', 'people', 'Borderline', 'Personality', 'Disorder', 'days', 'very', 'specific', 'detailed', 'diagnosis', 'Perhaps', 'diagnosis', 'was', 'just', 'catch-all', 'back', '60s', 'people', 'having', 'kind', 'bad', 'day', 'Mangold', 'heartfelt', 'commentary', 'track', 'out', 'many', 'things', ""'ll"", 'be', 'feeling', 'good', 'way', 'when', 'first', 'watch', 'film', 'center', 'gravity', 'Goldberg', 'enormous', 'expressiveness', 'Ryder', 'luminous', 'eyes', 'homage', 'sorts', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'Black', 'Narcissus', 'especially', 'how', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'film', 'where', 'director', 'time', 'let', 'things', 'happen', ""n't"", 'edit', 'whole', 'thing', 'four', 'second', 'cuts']",N/A

Honestly, folks, this is Winona Ryder's best performance to date, although it might not be  immediately obvious because of the tremendous subtlety in her acting. Sure,  Angelina Jolie is electrifying, but in obvious ways since her role was  clearly the flashier of the two. Despite rumors that they didn't get along  too well during the shoot, Ryder and Jolie work very well together  onscreen, and the supporting cast is stellar, particularly Clea DuVall  (Georgina) and Brittany Murphy (Daisy). There are a few scenes in this  movie that present some of Ryder's very best acting of all of her  films.Director James Mangold (Heavy, Cop Land) did a fine job avoiding  cheap sentimentality, and I was impressed with his fluid adaptation of a  very disjointed and unconventional narrative work. My one complaint is that  the film wasn't as gritty or as emotionally resonant as I would have liked,  so I walked out of the theater feeling more impressed with the performances  than impacted by the story. Still, for any Winona Ryder fan, this  movie--with its 2 hours full of close-ups of Ryder's hauntingly beautiful  face--is an absolute dream. Multiple layers of muted anguish are registered  in Ryder's expressive eyes, and her most powerful acting in this film comes  out through her subtle facial expressions rather than any spoken words.  &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; is not a disappointment by any means.

Susannah's (Ryder) flashback-riddled transition from social  &quot;ambivalence&quot; and dis-connection to a state of personal  acceptance is (at first) complicated by the personal dramas that surround  her.  At once appalled and fascinated by the &quot;secrets&quot; of her  peers at Claymore, she soon finds that they are largely misunderstood.  Railing against the profession (psychotherapy) that has failed to  &quot;cure&quot; her new friends, she finds sustenance in their mutual  alienation.Her relationship with Lisa (Jolie), the plain-speaking and  self-loathing sociopath becomes a challenge to her ambivalance.  This  intellectual tug of war between safe apathy and difficult empathy isn't  solved by escaping Claymore; it takes a tragic visceral experience to put  things in perspective.Ryder is in fine form throughout, a reassuring  presence amid the flightier and more self-destructive personalities on  display.  Jolie is well-cast, and takes to her role as if it were  tailor-made.  Notables among the supporting cast include Whoopi Goldberg as  the tough-loving head nurse, and Vanessa Redgrave as an impassive,  sphinx-like psychiatrist in charge.The deleted scenes that apprear in  this DVD version are an essential addition, and certainly help to  understand some of Susannah's behavior and motivation.

It's almost uncanny of how much sense the people have - that they are more real than any of the people you know.  There really is a fine line between genius and insanity, and this just reminds you of how close you can get.  Just watching it seemed to take me on a backward step to examine myself from a whole new view and to open my mind to the depth of emotions and stability.The performances in this movie are just captivating and bring the story to an inspirational level.  I've always admired Winona Ryder for her compassion in her acting.  Her work on Susanna was just wonderful - doesn't she deserve an Academy Award as well?  ...And Angelina Jolie, whom I usually avoid, was terrific.  I can't imagine any other cast with half the success.I really enjoyed this film and the insight it both offers and provokes.

It is a testament to this young actor's presence that even as dark and soul sickened and gloriously decaying as her character is, there is not a frame in this film that doesn't feel her infection.Winona Rider is equally excellent as the psychologically confused (or is it enlightened?) hero forced to navigate the depths of her own psyche. The interplay between these two is somehow able to range from the enchanting to the exquisitely painful; but from beginning to end remains capable of leaving you breathless. One look into Angelina Jolie's eyes and you will see the warm, jaundiced decay of a soul no longer battling with sanity. Fear is born of those eyes when you realize how strongly they've tempted your own tired efforts...even as the second look delves closer to a bleakness bearing fruition beyond existential suicide.Presented with the softly rendered and absorbing visualization of a young girl's decent into psychological insecurity; it is a hauntingly supple progression toward the half understood disturbance of what we might have experienced. James Mangold directed this film quite nicely from a very good screenplay; he managed to portray all these young women as young women in turmoil. No melodrama, no over the top sentimentality, just a frank peek into their tumultuous lives.If you've ever questioned your own sanity or escaped periods of exceptional melancholy in your life, this film is certain to trigger old fears. But it is also certain to remind you how exquisite and simple salvation can often be. This film deserves that second look, as well as its painful salvation: a jaundiced beauty whose tragic death is no less healing than the memory of a lost friend.

Well, although it's not quite the masterpiece that Cuckoo's Nest is, Girl, Interrupted is still very decent entertainment, and will keep audiences intrigued throughout.Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) is depressed and directionless after finishing high school in the late 1960's. A suicide attempt lands her in Claymore, a mental institution. She befriends the band of troubled women in her ward (Georgina the pathological liar, the sexually abused Daisy, the burn victim Polly) but falls under the hypnotic sway of Lisa (Angelina Jolie), the wildest and most hardened of the bunch. Will Susanna &quot;drop anchor&quot; at Claymore and perpetually act out like Lisa, or will she finally pull her mind together and leave institutional life behind?Girl, Interrupted is based on Susanna Kaysen's critically-acclaimed book, and the three writers, Anna Hamitlon Phelan, Lisa Loomer and James Mangold do a fine job of adapting it and the script is believable and occasionally moving. Mangled, who also directs, has put an extraordinarily large amount of effort into this picture, he is obviously committed to making it do well, which Girl, Interrupted has done successfully both at the box office and with the critics. Winona Ryder's underrated performance is one of her best in ages, and she brings Susanna memorably back to life. Clea DuVall and Whoopi Goldberg tag along to Ryder nicely, but this is in most ways Angelina Jolie's movie. She is vivid and amazing as the sociopath Lisa, in a performance which won her a Golden Globe and an Oscar. There are flaws in the film, it is sometimes a little shaky on it's feet and the `Girls Night Out' theme is a little repetitive, but what remains is a quietly touching piece of art that is highly recommendable.Girl, Interrupted is a big achievement for all the cast and crew, and it is filmmaking of a high order.",4,Quietly Moving.,985392000,"03 24, 2001",2001,2062,"['Girl', 'InterruptedScore', '78/100Been', 'die-hard', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'fan', 'could', 'hardly', 'wait', 'see', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'film', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'people', 'changing', 'setting', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Well', 'not', 'quite', 'masterpiece', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'still', 'very', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'will', 'keep', 'audiences', 'intrigued', 'throughout.Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'depressed', 'directionless', 'finishing', 'high', 'school', 'late', '1960', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Claymore', 'mental', 'institution', 'band', 'troubled', 'women', 'ward', 'Georgina', 'pathological', 'liar', 'sexually', 'abused', 'Daisy', 'burn', 'victim', 'Polly', 'hypnotic', 'sway', 'Lisa', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'wildest', 'most', 'hardened', 'bunch', 'Will', 'Susanna', 'quot', 'drop', 'anchor', 'quot', 'Claymore', 'perpetually', 'act', 'out', 'Lisa', 'will', 'finally', 'pull', 'mind', 'together', 'leave', 'institutional', 'life', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'based', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'critically-acclaimed', 'book', 'three', 'writers', 'Anna', 'Hamitlon', 'Phelan', 'Lisa', 'Loomer', 'James', 'Mangold', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'adapting', 'script', 'believable', 'occasionally', 'moving', 'Mangled', 'who', 'also', 'put', 'extraordinarily', 'large', 'amount', 'effort', 'picture', 'obviously', 'committed', 'making', 'do', 'well', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'done', 'successfully', 'box', 'office', 'critics', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'underrated', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'ages', 'Susanna', 'memorably', 'back', 'life', 'Clea', 'DuVall', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'tag', 'Ryder', 'nicely', 'most', 'ways', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'movie', 'vivid', 'amazing', 'sociopath', 'Lisa', 'performance', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Oscar', 'are', 'flaws', 'film', 'sometimes', 'little', 'shaky', 'feet', 'Girls', 'Night', 'Out', 'theme', 'little', 'repetitive', 'what', 'quietly', 'touching', 'piece', 'art', 'highly', 'recommendable.Girl', 'Interrupted', 'big', 'achievement', 'cast', 'crew', 'filmmaking', 'high', 'order']",N/A

Yet I can't help wondering if I'll end up like Lisa (Angelina Jolie's character) or maybe perhaps Winnona Ryder's character (I can't remember her name at the moment). I absolutley loved this movie but my friend hated it. She said it was the most boring movie ever. Okay now onto the actual review:THE ACTINGWinnona Ryder does a hauntingly good job at playing someone who thinks she's insane but really isn't.  Angelina Jolie, I think, is Lisa in real life. She has a humor about being at a nuthouse,like it's just one big game but at the same time you realize that she has a real problem.  The co stars have the following illnesses to add into the mix: a bilimic girl, a pathological liar, a girl that sets herself on fire when she was young and it's hard to look at her but she has a heart of gold, and a really fat girl.THE PLOT  Susanna's mother(I think that's the name of Winnona Ryder's character) thinks that Susanna is insane but she can't admit her to a mental institution because she's over 18 so she gets tricked into admitting herself. She meets and makes friends with the other &quot;insane&quot; people. Her roommate, Gorgina, is one of my favorite characters. She;s obsessed with &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and when you first see her you think she's normal but then you discover that she's a pathological liar and she's quite good at it.FINAL WORDSIf I'm not mistaken I believe that this is a true story. It's set in either 1967 or 1969(I can't remember. So if you have ever wondered if you will end up at a funny farm then watch this movie.

Winona Ryder plays Susanna Kaysen, an inpatient in a true-life story who told her experiences in the institution in a book of the same title. Her own story is poignant but ever rivaled by that of other fellow patients. One is Georgina, Susannah's sort-of happy-go-quirky roommate. Then there's Daisy, a sad and somber patient whose story will break your heart. And there's long-time resident Polly, sweet and loveable but still a prisoner to her childhood trauma in which she set herself on fire. But stealing the show is Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie, possibly the most spellbinding of less-than-heroic movie characters since Hannibal Lecter. It is impossible not to relate to Lisa and even sympathize with her somewhat, even though she is menacing and can be cruel. She traumatizes other patients, for example taunting poor Polly and calling her &quot;torch&quot;. Lisa is the escape artist of the group and bonds with Susannah in surprising ways.

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[29, 35]","&quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; is a very well portrayed true story about a young woman who has lost her way in the sixties and ends up in a mental institution.  While Angelina Jolie drew me to this film, what left me with the biggest impression was the overall story and the fact that it's a true story makes it that much more incredible.  While it's a given that Hollywood adds and subtracts from the &quot;truth&quot; in stories such as this one; even if there is just a modicum of the truth left to this story, it conveys Susanna Kaysen's story with a true depth of feeling and character that is extremely compelling, resulting in a heartrending yet enlightening film.Given the fact that Angelina Jolie won and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for this film for her exceptional performance, which again shows the incredible range of acting skills she possesses; Winona Ryder was the intended star of this film and she shines perfectly in this role.  It has been some time since I saw a film of hers and I would definitely have to say that she's done nothing but get better!  One cannot help but give acclaim to Whoopi Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave for their outstanding performances in supporting roles.James Mangold deserves high praise for lending his directing and writing talents for the screenplay to this film and taking it in the direction that he did when considering how the original book was written.The Premise:As stated above, &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; is the true story written by Susanna Kaysen when in her tumultuous youth during the sixties, she brought herself to the brink where, despite her denial, she'd attempted suicide and ended up in a mental institution where her life was irrevocably changed...I highly recommend this film to any and all who are interested in extremely well told and acted dramatic stories that are intellectually and emotionally deep in the telling!  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Director's Commentary-Deleted Scenes with Commentary-HBO First Look:  The Making-Of Girl, Interrupted-Isolated Music Score-Theatrical Trailers-Talent Files-Production Notes",5,"Girl, Interrupted - An exceptionally well told true story!",1074384000,"01 18, 2004",2004,2112,"['quot', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'quot', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'true', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'way', 'sixties', 'up', 'mental', 'institution', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'drew', 'film', 'what', 'left', 'biggest', 'impression', 'was', 'overall', 'story', 'fact', 'true', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'incredible', 'given', 'Hollywood', 'subtracts', 'quot', 'truth', 'quot', 'stories', 'such', 'one', 'even', 'just', 'modicum', 'truth', 'left', 'story', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'story', 'true', 'depth', 'feeling', 'character', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'resulting', 'heartrending', 'yet', 'enlightening', 'film.Given', 'fact', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'film', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'again', 'incredible', 'range', 'acting', 'skills', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'was', 'intended', 'star', 'film', 'perfectly', 'role', 'been', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'hers', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'say', 'done', 'nothing', 'get', 'better', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'give', 'acclaim', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'supporting', 'roles.James', 'Mangold', 'high', 'praise', 'lending', 'directing', 'writing', 'talents', 'screenplay', 'film', 'taking', 'direction', 'did', 'when', 'considering', 'how', 'original', 'book', 'was', 'written.The', 'Premise', 'stated', 'quot', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'quot', 'true', 'story', 'written', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'when', 'tumultuous', 'youth', 'sixties', 'brought', 'brink', 'where', 'denial', ""'d"", 'attempted', 'suicide', 'ended', 'up', 'mental', 'institution', 'where', 'life', 'was', 'irrevocably', 'changed', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'extremely', 'well', 'told', 'acted', 'dramatic', 'stories', 'are', 'intellectually', 'emotionally', 'deep', 'telling', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Director', 'Commentary-Deleted', 'Scenes', 'Commentary-HBO', 'First', 'Look', 'Making-Of', 'Girl', 'Interrupted-Isolated', 'Music', 'Score-Theatrical', 'Trailers-Talent', 'Files-Production', 'Notes']",N/A

She is superb as the troubled young woman, her expressive dark  eyes able to convey the nuances of sadness as she discovers the world  around her.Angelina Jolie, who won an academy award as supporting  actress for her role, is also perfectly cast as her fellow inmate, whose  cool self-confidence and piercingly honest remarks are a contrast to  Susanna's quiet depression and sense of wonder.Whoopi Goldberg plays the  role of an understanding nurse and Vanessa Redgrave plays a psychiatrist.  These are small cameo roles and the star recognition of these two actresses  somehow distract from the stark view of life behind the locked doors of a  mental hospital.Against this background, the historical time period is  authentically captured by the music, the TV news and a brief episode with  some hippies during an abortive escape.

Yes, James Mangold will never be mistaken for a great visual stylist -- he falls under the heading  &quot;Works Well With Actors.&quot; Yet the film manages to avoid a great  number of pitfalls, and it works extraordinarily well as a group portrait  and as a chance for a cast of gifted young actresses to sink their teeth  into roles that go beyond girlfriend-of-the-hero.Angelina Jolie was  virtually guaranteed the Oscar, since she's essentially playing the Jack  Nicholson role, the wild child who stirs things up. But don't overlook her  castmates, especially Brittany Murphy and Clea DuVall, as well as Winona  Ryder in a generous performance that allows her co-stars to shine. Ryder  may be top-billed and a producer on the film, but she understands that her  character is basically a reactive element, not an active one; she is the  audience's surrogate, a relatively normal person spending some time with  emotionally disturbed girls who today might be considered merely difficult  -- the movie is set in the late '60s, and we recognize the double standard  that boys who acted out were just being boys, whereas girls who acted out  were wacko. Mangold, who made a somewhat shaky debut with the dramatically  inert &quot;Heavy&quot; and followed it with the powerful if incoherent  &quot;Cop Land&quot; (which I suspect suffered from severe pre-release  trimming), is shaping up as a director to watch; this movie represents a  leap forward from his previous efforts, and it'll be interesting to see  what he does next.",4,The cast makes it,964828800,"07 29, 2000",2000,1647,"['Yes', 'movie', 'based', 'more', 'less', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'memoir', 'few', 'clumsy', 'additions', 'covers', 'familiar', 'territory', 'Yes', 'James', 'Mangold', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'mistaken', 'great', 'visual', 'stylist', 'heading', 'quot', 'Works', 'Well', 'Actors.', 'quot', 'film', 'avoid', 'great', 'number', 'pitfalls', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'group', 'portrait', 'chance', 'cast', 'gifted', 'young', 'actresses', 'sink', 'teeth', 'roles', 'go', 'girlfriend-of-the-hero.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'was', 'virtually', 'guaranteed', 'Oscar', 'essentially', 'playing', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'role', 'wild', 'child', 'who', 'things', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'castmates', 'especially', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Clea', 'DuVall', 'as', 'well', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'generous', 'performance', 'co-stars', 'shine', 'Ryder', 'may', 'be', 'top-billed', 'producer', 'film', 'character', 'basically', 'reactive', 'element', 'not', 'active', 'one', 'audience', 'surrogate', 'relatively', 'normal', 'person', 'spending', 'time', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'girls', 'who', 'today', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'merely', 'difficult', 'movie', 'set', 'late', ""'60s"", 'recognize', 'double', 'standard', 'who', 'acted', 'out', 'were', 'just', 'being', 'boys', 'whereas', 'girls', 'who', 'acted', 'out', 'were', 'wacko', 'Mangold', 'who', 'made', 'somewhat', 'shaky', 'debut', 'dramatically', 'inert', 'quot', 'Heavy', 'quot', 'followed', 'powerful', 'incoherent', 'quot', 'Cop', 'Land', 'quot', 'suspect', 'suffered', 'severe', 'pre-release', 'trimming', 'shaping', 'up', 'director', 'watch', 'movie', 'leap', 'forward', 'previous', 'efforts', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'next']",N/A

Girls, please do not torture your boyfriends/husbands by making them watch this.  That said, the film is based on a true story, a book by Susanna Kaysen.  Susanna (played by Winona Ryder) was in a mental institution as a young woman for a full year in the late 1960's.  She meets the enigmatic and magnetic Lisa (played by Angelina Jolie), a street-smart, seemingly confident and cool young woman whom many other patients idolize.  Susanna soon falls under Lisa's spell, too, but with disastrous consequences.  Great performances all around, including Vanessa Redgrave as one of the institution's psychiatrists and Brittany Murphy as patient Daisy.  In this film, Murphy actually has some meat on her bones and looks much better.  I did not even realize it was her until the end credits.  Whoopi Goldberg is so wonderful as a caring nurse.  You just wish she could be your mom.There is one scene so disturbing in the film, which caused me to rate Girl, Interrupted four stars instead of five.  Something so horrible occurs in the scene, and right after that, something unspeakable.  You have no time to recover from the shock, and never really do. Another scene has graphic and disturbing dialouge. Both scenes take place out of the institution, and show Lisa's true nature.The extras in this DVD are what extras are meant to be.  There is a wonderful commentary with Ryder and author Kaysen.  Photos of the young Kaysen are shown, along with bits of deleted scenes.

This version is a drama based on the memoir of a writer who spent time as an 18-year-old in a mental institution largely because she wanted to be a writer and that wasn't considered a real career for women back then.I was the same age as Susannah (played by Winona Ryder) in 1967 when she is sent to a rather elegant funny farm for attempted suicide and borderline personality disorder, whatever that is (it's kind of a psychiatric catch-all for hard-to-diagnose mental issues).  There she meets a motley group of young women who, for various reasons, can't cope with real life, ruled over by no-BS Lisa (Angelina Jolie), the supposedly sociopathic queen bee.  Susannah becomes so attached to them that she doesn't want to leave, until Lisa, ever the troublemaker, makes her run away with her.  Predictably, something horrible happens while they're on the run that ultimately helps her see the light at the end of her tunnel.Whoopi Goldberg, even with that awful Afro, gives a wonderfully restrained performance as a savvy, compassionate nurse. Jolie is surprisingly good (won an Oscar, of course, for her performance), and Ryder and the others, including Ruby the cat, are genuine.

15456,AOVU5A9GVXHFT,0767819586,Margaret Opine,"[2, 2]","The psychiatrist said, ""It's not uncommon...it happens to a lot of young women."" And then diagnosed the young (female) patient with a ""borderline"" personality disorder.  What that means is ""she doesn't seem right""; ""she's not getting it""--and that means the young woman was brought up among people with 'resources' and she is not doing everything according to their cultural ethos so her parents will have ""bragging rights"" about what university she will attend, which would mean they were great parents (which, in essence they were) but they, as parents would worry about that--all parents did during this period: with 'means' or not), because there is this factor that her failure to adhere to the cultural'tracts' and expectations means that a reflection falls upon the parents and affects their status in their local community and society. Such was the culture during this period. Parents were totally concerned about their reputations in the community--It means and meant an awful lot.  And still today, but then, during this period, it was an obsession with parents. People killed to save their reputation and status: checkout ""Perry Mason"".  Parents were very serious about ""loosing face.""  And often their children would embarass them in a timeless teen rebellion.  As a last-ditched effort the parents who could afford it sent their children to a sanotorium, other parents set them out into their own independent lives.It is obvioius by the characters that some of these young women wanted to step out of the proverbial box and go it on their own and that caused them problems inside.  They felt 'wrong' and their parents and community supported that sense of wrong, but at the same time they felt 'right' for themselves; they found they could not comply with the collective sense that was in place for proper development: ""Just do as you're told and you'll be fine,"" but it caused problems inside.  It caused confusion, agitation, resistance and depression and it is very hard to get through this in your young life and make it to the other side where light and life is for you.For a young woman to say she wanted to 'write' without getting a college degree or without getting married first was defined as being 'unfavorable' and more like a 'bum' but today we invite writing careers because sometimes they take off into lucrative careers.  Today, women pick and choose when to get married, when to have children and how many, all such as that, but still: SOME young women will have a really hard  time, a really serious ""mind jam"" and can't get on with their life.  (Well, young men too...everybody gets jammed at middleaged; so we all go through brain jams that are difficult to get by and live through but they are more natural than crazy: some of us experienced people say.) Afterall, 'crazy' means you're not mentally compatible with everyone else.In the meantime, life is going on and more events happen that sometimes does something like ""shock therapy"" and ""we wake up to smell the coffee"" eventually; by then we may be fifty or sixty. We awaken to the fact that life is not something we can really change or design to our liking directly; this is other life going on that we cannot controll. It is something that we may be able to 'structure','order' and 'manage' to a certain extent but we still have to live through it to the other side.Then, there were young women in the sanotorium in this movie who were basically 'kids' and would remain basically kids for all their lives; they trade their parents for caretakers in a luxury sanotorium. Independence and 'be strong and face the world' is a bunch of crap, their minds might say. I prefer to just sit here and be here and not have to deal with people and their criticisms. I'll be a criticism. But some parents can't afford a luxury sanotorium, Whoopi's character tells one of the patients.I liked that line a lot: ""It happens to a lot of young women""....it may just happen to all young people. Growing up is hard to do: getting reality straight and feeling our drives pushing us and desiring what we shouldn't have (all of that) and having dreams and wishes in the mind and not realizing what to do with them...all of that is very difficult to get through and learn but most of us eventually do it.It takes quite a bit of adjusting (in stages) to live adult life in a 'real sense' and by the time a young woman does get her bearings she may have had some traumatic events early on that she can't take back, she can't erase, that has ruined her 'perfect' life...and so on, but then, for her to get well she has to keep going and learn hardcore that there is no such thing as a perfect life where people don't die from just about anything, and there is no such thing as perfect people that will not break rules,and, lie and cheat, and that their own life and living is not so broken, not as broken...as it seems to be because 'normal' is a wide field of gray; it is the formulaic structure, plan and goal for the IDEAL life that gets in the way.Real life is very hard to take if you're a stark idealist. And an ideal life is hard to take if you prone to more realism.I think this movie is an American classic in many ways.  It is right on. The characters are so believable.  (And no, Angelina Jolie does not over-act. She places the role. Without her performance we would not have felt we were in a mental ward in an upper income sanotorium. Like Whoopi Goldberg's character said, ""I've worked at the public institutions...""  Bravo for the performances!!!Suggestion: Give this to a troubled young girl before she goes off the edge.  Show her what the edge really looks like.  And don't think the real-life nurses do not know when you're not taking the pills, they do.  They may just feel that their job requirement is to give you the pill and not too much else. But, the young people in the sanotorium do feel that when they hurt themselves deliberately they are hurting someone else.--MO",5,JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR ...WITH A LINE OF DIALOGUE I

15458,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,0767819586,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[5, 13]","There are some people out there who might like Girl, Interrupted. Those people, most of them women, will identify with the soul-paralyzing apathy of the lead character, Susanna (Ryder). Her descent into an emotionally barren life of empty drudgery is actually based on the autobiography of Susanna Kaysen; her book chronicles the days of her life in the 60's. Being a true story, very little happens, as most real people lead brain-bleedingly dull lives. Aside from some angst-ridden whining by Susanna, and her occasional &quot;adventurous&quot; tryst with bad-girl antagonist Lisa, this movie still has the same dull heartbeat as many of its doped-up and drooling extras.Ryder did a good job. With a role as self-indulgent as any lead character is in a drama about an emotional journey to self-acceptance, Winona still managed to keep the character fresh without dabbling in any pandering. Jolie, though, as the crazy inmate that befriends Susanna, well, let me tell you...Writers like to create &quot;crazy&quot; characters, by crazy I mean they do all the things we all want to do but don't, and so, even though they are institutionalized by their movie-world peers, we in the real world don't think they're crazy so much as cool and reckless and lonely and wild and sassy. Hence, we are supposed to like the crazy character, learn a little bit about ourselves, and go home happy. Jolie's portrayal fails on all three counts, despite (or perhaps because of) fitting the Hollywood stereotype to a T. It is not enough to widen your eyes, speak in peaks and valleys, and behave like a manic-depressive Danny Kaye-wannabe. One must strive for subtlety, or at least depth. Enacting out her cool, textbook version of insane, Jolie sucks all the life out of this film from the word go. Not that there's much to begin with.The first quarter of the movie is interesting to watch, only insomuch as it seems to be highly derivative of Vonnegut. Susanna seems to be &quot;unstuck in time&quot; as it were, and events in her life are depicted out of proper context. The suggestion is that Susanna is drifting back and forth between different events. She's the new millennium's Billy Pilgrim, except this version is written by Nora Ephron.Well, not really, but that's what it seems like.The poignancy of the story, its heart and strength, is lost in dull, poetic self-absorption. It's akin to reading a romantically jilted younger sister's diary; there's so much angst, so much pain, and you really do want to feel sorry for her. But then you get to an original poem and the first line is &quot;Darkness fills my empty heart,&quot; and you guffaw out loud. Admit it. You do.Of all the things going for this film--beautiful cinematography, some decent acting, rich subject matter, and even Whoopi Goldberg (turning in an excellent performance as Nurse Valerie)--it is anchored down by an immovable plot and mindless meandering.

15459,A2OMGHKYF94FM9,0767819586,marky77,"[0, 0]","This truely is one of the best movies ever made, I love it so much.Based on the novel by Susanna Kaysen about the 18 months she spent in a mental institution for depression and Borderline Personality Disorder when she was 18 (which is a true story). Although I think that anybody would enjoy this movie, it's special to me because I also suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder myself and it's nice to see a movie which handles the subject sensitively.Borderline Personality Disorder was a very controversial diagnosis in the 1960s (when this movie takes place), as even less was known about it than is now. Very little research was done into it back but the general diagnosis criteria and known sympoms were still the same:1. Extreme black and white thinking (unable to see the grey area).2. Unstable relationships characterised between feelings of idealation (love and adoration) and devaluation (anger and dislike).3. Impulsivity, usually in self-destructive areas (e.g. binge eating, alcohol abuse, reckless driving, excessive spending and building up debt).4. Mood swings between base (normal) mood, anxiety, irritability and depression.5. Suicides threats or attempts or self mutilation (cutting, punching etc)6. Irrational (to others) fear of abandonment and of being alone.7. Outbursts of anger.8. Shakey sence of self image - unsure about life goals, ambitions and belives such as what type of friends and lovers to have, carrer paths an sexual orientation.9. Chronic and persistant feelings of emptyness (also described as boredom or loneliness).The move is nicely paced and gets Susanna into the mental hospital within the first 10 or 15 minutes.The characters include Polly (a schizophrenic who purposely set herself on fire as a child); Janet (an anorexic); Geogina, Susanna's room-mate (a pathological liar) and Lisa (a sociopath). The characters are all amazing well fleshed out and acted. They have very real and brilliantly acted emotions and personalities and are very beliveable as real people.Susanna (Winona Ryder) and Lisa (Angelina Jolie) are particularly good in this movie.A stunning and moving story of Susanna's illness and recovery and the nature of people and of mental ilness. It does a wonderfull job of removing some of the stigma that people associate with mental illness.I would reccomend this movie in particular to people who are interested in mental illness or psychology or have such an ilness themselves (especially BPD) but also to anybody looking for a good movie.

15461,A152C8GYY25HAH,0767819586,Matthew Horner,"[4, 6]","Criticism has been aimed at Girl, Interrupted for several reasons. One is the accusation that the mental institution it is set in is couldn't have existed in the real world, but I don't agree. Another is that the illnesses the girls suffer from are not clearly defined. I don't think that that's relevant because very few viewers have much understanding of the definition of any mental illness, despite all the pop journalism TV shows that profess to give us knowledge of such things. What I do think is that Girl, Interrupted may be the strongest major American movie about the female psyche since Thelma and Louise. As such, it's appeal is mainly to women and to enlightened men.The movie begins in 1968, which for America was not so unlike the present. We were a polarized country, torn apart by ethical and moral differences. The external forces were different from those at work today, but the feelings and responses were often the same. Much of America was again trying to disprove the axiom that money doesn't buy happiness. Youth in general was alienated, and the general consensus was that some power apart from the family needed to fix these kids. So when young Susanna Kaysen [Winona Ryder] gets overwhelmed by despair and attempts suicide, the solution is a typical one for her times. She is sent to a mental institution. It is true that there were plenty of mentally ill people in 1968, but it can also be argued that in crazy times, some people go crazy in response. These people are what is known as borderlines, neither crazy nor sane. Susanna, whose story is a true one, is an example of this problem, and she is but one of millions of people.In the institution, Susanna meets a fascinating set of characters, most of whom are certifiably mentally ill. These are people against which she can weigh her own real or imagined problems. One of them is her room mate Georgina [Clea Duvall], a charming girl who is an admitted pathological liar. There is Daisy [Brittany Murphy], a victim of one of society's greatest taboos, and there is Lisa [Angeline Jolie], someone so disturbed that many patients steer clear of her. After a few weeks, Susanna bonds with many patients and especially with Lisa. They become extremely close. Bonds are difficult to hold together in the 'sane' world, and within a mental hospital, things can fall apart quickly and unexpectedly. This is a setting where an especially intense drama can unfold, and this is exactly what happens in Girl, Interrupted.Ryder and Duvall, as well as Elizabeth Moss as Polly, give remarkable performances. This is Ryder's best work in several years. As Nurse Valerie, Whoppi Goldberg is finally back at the top of her form. As for Jolie, she is among the top five actresses of her generation and was awarded the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work in this movie. She is one of those beautiful people who don't think twice about how they look, if, as in Girl, Interrupted, the character needs to look dreadful at times. As a result, much like the young Bette Davis, audience members often have mixed emotions about Jolie. Ultimately, her brilliance should win them over.Girl, Interrupted is strong stuff and pulls it punches far less often than is usual in a main stream picture. For reasons which escape me, some people seem to be made uncomfortable by movies which have female bonding as a central theme. For those of you who are like this, not to worry. There's certainly no lack of male bonding movies.",5,Best female bonding movie since Thelma and Louise,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,3484,"['Criticism', 'been', 'aimed', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'several', 'reasons', 'One', 'accusation', 'mental', 'institution', 'set', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'existed', 'real', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'illnesses', 'girls', 'suffer', 'are', 'not', 'clearly', 'defined', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'relevant', 'very', 'few', 'viewers', 'have', 'much', 'understanding', 'definition', 'mental', 'illness', 'pop', 'journalism', 'TV', 'shows', 'profess', 'give', 'knowledge', 'such', 'things', 'What', 'do', 'think', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'may', 'be', 'strongest', 'major', 'American', 'movie', 'female', 'psyche', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'such', 'appeal', 'mainly', 'women', 'enlightened', 'men.The', 'movie', '1968', 'America', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'present', 'were', 'polarized', 'country', 'torn', 'apart', 'ethical', 'moral', 'differences', 'external', 'forces', 'were', 'different', 'work', 'today', 'feelings', 'responses', 'were', 'often', 'same', 'Much', 'America', 'was', 'again', 'trying', 'disprove', 'axiom', 'money', ""n't"", 'buy', 'happiness', 'Youth', 'general', 'was', 'alienated', 'general', 'consensus', 'was', 'power', 'apart', 'family', 'needed', 'fix', 'kids', 'So', 'when', 'young', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', '[', 'Winona', 'Ryder', ']', 'overwhelmed', 'despair', 'attempts', 'suicide', 'solution', 'typical', 'one', 'times', 'sent', 'mental', 'institution', 'true', 'were', 'plenty', 'mentally', 'ill', 'people', '1968', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'argued', 'crazy', 'times', 'people', 'go', 'crazy', 'response', 'people', 'are', 'what', 'known', 'borderlines', 'crazy', 'sane', 'Susanna', 'story', 'true', 'one', 'example', 'problem', 'one', 'millions', 'people.In', 'institution', 'Susanna', 'fascinating', 'set', 'characters', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'certifiably', 'mentally', 'ill', 'are', 'people', 'can', 'weigh', 'own', 'real', 'imagined', 'problems', 'One', 'room', 'mate', 'Georgina', '[', 'Clea', 'Duvall', ']', 'charming', 'girl', 'who', 'admitted', 'pathological', 'liar', 'Daisy', '[', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', ']', 'victim', 'one', 'society', 'greatest', 'taboos', 'Lisa', '[', 'Angeline', 'Jolie', ']', 'someone', 'so', 'disturbed', 'many', 'patients', 'steer', 'clear', 'few', 'weeks', 'Susanna', 'bonds', 'many', 'patients', 'especially', 'Lisa', 'become', 'extremely', 'close', 'Bonds', 'are', 'difficult', 'hold', 'together', ""'sane"", 'world', 'mental', 'hospital', 'things', 'can', 'fall', 'apart', 'quickly', 'unexpectedly', 'setting', 'where', 'especially', 'intense', 'drama', 'can', 'unfold', 'exactly', 'what', 'Girl', 'Interrupted.Ryder', 'Duvall', 'as', 'well', 'Elizabeth', 'Moss', 'Polly', 'give', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'Ryder', 'best', 'work', 'several', 'years', 'Nurse', 'Valerie', 'Whoppi', 'Goldberg', 'finally', 'back', 'top', 'form', 'Jolie', 'top', 'five', 'actresses', 'generation', 'was', 'awarded', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'work', 'movie', 'one', 'beautiful', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'twice', 'how', 'look', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'character', 'look', 'dreadful', 'times', 'result', 'much', 'young', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'audience', 'members', 'often', 'have', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'Jolie', 'Ultimately', 'brilliance', 'should', 'win', 'over.Girl', 'Interrupted', 'strong', 'stuff', 'far', 'less', 'often', 'usual', 'main', 'stream', 'picture', 'reasons', 'escape', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'movies', 'have', 'female', 'bonding', 'central', 'theme', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'worry', 'certainly', 'lack', 'male', 'bonding', 'movies']",N/A

With a bunch of terrific actresses, and unknowns, who light up the screen, this film is well worth watching.Not many actresses could play the roles in this movie convincingly. Winona Ryder does a great job of the borderline-personality-disorder-ridden Susanna, although the short hair was a big no-no. She really makes you feel for her character, whether she's screaming, crying, getting it off her chest, or making you look at mental health problems a completely different. Angelina Jolie in a blonde role (biiiiiiiiiig mistake) is wonderful, although in some shots looks frighteningly skinny. She's a brilliant actress, although the dreadful blonde wig does nothing for her looks, and her lips can sometimes be distracting - the rest of us need collagen to get her kinda lips! Angelina steals the show as the charismatic ""we are very rare, and we are mostly men"" sociopath, making you love & hate her character at the same time. She won a well-deserved academy award for supporting actress for this role. Alongside these two brilliant actresses are: Whoopi Goldberg, Clea DuVall, Brittany Murphy (who looks quite depressing in this), Jared Leto, and Vanessa Redgrave.I have actually read the book, I bought it not long after seeing the movie, but I couldn't really get into it. It's very different in some aspects, and the ending is somewhat different. The movie implies that Lisa never got out or Susanna never saw her again, but in the book, they do meet up again, and Lisa's had a child, and has very stretchy skin on her stomach, from what I can remember. The last scene of Lisa strapped to the bed is very moving, with the narration.The friendships in this movie stand true, and are very emotional to watch. Sometimes, you know what you what Susanna means when she says Lisa's eyes are captivating, cos they are, and you get drawn to her almost.One of my favourite scenes is when they all go out for ice creams - ""You know, taking us for ice creams in a blizzard... makes you wonder who the real whack jobs are."" This is a hilarious scene, and it has to be seen to be believed. I LOVE Brittany Murphy, she's so fixated with the ice cream cone in her face!The extras are quite interesting on this DVD. The deleted scenes, albeit extension of scenes and overly long, are still worth watching, with an insight into exactly what is under the bandage on Lisa's arm *ouch*, and also a making of documentary. I think the commentary by director James Mangold would also be interesting to watch too, as you could find out about stuff you maybe never noticed before. I won't be watching it anytime soon though: the commentary that is.If you haven't seen this movie, you have to see it! It's well worth seeing, and although you'll be left emotional afterwards (unless you're a cold hearted Scrooge), it's a must have for your collection.

After graduating high school, Kasson went through a difficult and confusing time.  She attempted suicide and was persuaded to sign herself into a psychiatric institution.  We are drawn into Susanna's world as she desperately tries to understand and get control of her problems.  Winona Ryder does an admirable job of portraying Susanna Kasson.  In fact, this movie was toted as Ryder's baby.  However, Angelina Jolie steals the movie as the psychotic Lisa.  Lisa is a strongly written character and Jolie does a splendid job.  She makes the role of Lisa so important to the viewer, that you find yourself wondering not whether Susanna will overcome her borderline personality problem, but what happened to Lisa after Kasson's stay at Claymoore Institution.This movie is definitely different from the novel it is based upon.  However, it's been a while since I've seen such an insightful look at what goes on within a psychiatric center.  Someone really did their homework here.  I work in an older psych center - it's been around for over 50 years.  The older buildings have tunnels underneath which were used to move patients, food carts and linen from building to building.  People were often institutionalized for things no longer considered psychosis, such as homosexual tendencies.  Often times people are released from the institutions, considered cured, when they are not ready to interact with the world.  And often times, patients become institutionalized and, although jealous of anyone who finally gets discharged from the hospital, do anything they can to remain hospitalized because they are fearful of life outside of the institution.Strong storyline, strongly acted.  You truly believ that the actors are the characters they portray.  You care about them and waht happens to them.  Susanna's thoughts about her psychosis and her life in the institution are truly insightful.  This movie is very well done.

There are a number of stellar performances in this film, and although Ryder was given top billing, Angelina Jolie steals the show as Lisa, a disturbed patient, the role which ultimately won Jolie an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.

Based on a true story, the movie artfully depicts the tragedy of personality disorders, of some hospitals ineffectiveness in really dealing with the patient's true problems.  Ryder is very good, in fact one of the best performances I've seen her do.  She conveys the frailty, the ambivalence, the fear of possibly being ""crazy"".  At first denying her suicide attempt, she finally admits it later in the film.  Angelina Jolie won her Oscar for supporting actress in this role, and I can see why.  Her character, Lisa, is not the least bit likeable, and although she struts her self around the hospital, her own vulnerability and her desire to ""anchor herself"" there makes her pitiable, but at the same time she is malicious and vitriolic to say the least.  The rest of the cast features some good support as well:  Whoopi Goldberg, controlled and low key in her role as the pleasant Valerie; Clea Duvall as the pathological liar Georgina; Elizabeth Moss as the physically as well as emotionally scarred Torch; Brittany Murphy is very good as Daisy, the one patient who really should have stayed in the institution, and whom Jolie brings a fateful ending to; Vanessa Redgrave is pretty much wasted in her brief role, but one can't deny her impact on screen; Jared Leto is seen briefly as Tobey, the draft dodger who tries to spirit Ryder away; Mary Kay Place as the socialite wife of a professor who had a thing with Ryder; Angela Bettis in a brief but memorable role as one of the patients (she later goes on to star in ""May"" and ""Carrie"", the TV movie); and Jeffrey Tambor as the rather ineffectual Dr. Melvin.GIRL INTERRUPTED is a disturbing movie and it requires a great deal of patience; one doesn't want to laugh at the misfortunes of others, but as human beings, sometimes the funny things an emotionally disturbed person does seems humorous to us, as it does to them.

Susanna Kaysen is a character that is deeply disaffected with everything and it makes her very unhappy. Unhappy to the the extent that she has to be sent to mental instution to give her a new, more postive perspective on life.The film charts her slow evolution over 18 months of voluntary institutionalization, showing the female mind at its lowest but also the few sparks of hope that begin to appear as time goes on.Angelina Jolie is remarkable as ever, bringing an intense passion to her role, showing Lisa to be astounding but self destructive creature. Ms. Jolie deserved her oscar for this role. I cant imagine anyone else playing Lisa with such conviction.The same goes for Britany Murphy. Her role is small but crucial. For me Daisy was the most disturbing character and as a result the most interesting watch. She is deeply unstable and, as the film progesses, we see she is in such a state with good reason. Britany Murphy is at her best here.My one problem with this movie is Winona Ryder. Casting her just seems too easy for me. Like Hollywood producers were sitting around asking themselves who would be ""edgy"" enough but still with enough boxoffice appeal to get butts in the seats. Thats not to say that Winona Ryder didnt do a good job. She did. I just feel like there was probably someone out there that could have done better.I do love this movie. It says a lot about how we see the world and how this view affects us and how we interact with society.

15474,A26BDXG9KVH7SU,0767819586,Mom of One,"[6, 9]","I am usually rather suspicious of &quot;Oscar Material&quot; movies (I won't comment on &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;), however, I was pleasantly surprised with &quot;Girl, Interrupted.&quot;I have always  been amused by professional critics' opinions of films because, for some  reason, they often don't mesh with the general public.  I feel the director  did an excellent job controlling the aura of the film.  While I have never  seen any of his other work, if he is able to accomplish other masterpieces  which are as grand as this film is, he has a lifetime career.Even though  I have never seen &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,&quot;  I don't  believe it is fair to compare &quot;Girl&quot; to it.  This was a film  based on a women's experience in a mental institution.  The conditions  which prompted the various characters to have to be placed in the  institution pale in comparison to &quot;normal&quot; life in modern times.  This only allows us to see how times have changed.The acting was superb  and giving out only one Oscar to it's cause was a travesty.  Ryder should  have been right up there on stage with Jolie (whose character, in my  opinion, was much more involved than 'supporting' Ryder's character).  I  like the fact that a couple of BBW's were included.  They are often hard to  find in films. Nonetheless, they were present here (even if they were in a  &quot;loony bin&quot;).  The &quot;smaller&quot; characters were pleasantly  portrayed by &quot;bigger&quot; names in Hollywood which shows nobody  should ever consider themselves too grand to take a small part in a  movie.Concerning the DVD special features, I would like to have seen a  little more information about the actors.  Nonetheless, the director's  commentary was superbly done and allowed me to hear about the goings on of  the film and to slightly learn more about the supporting cast.

15475,A15ORUD5TVNIV6,0767819586,Mom Pressfour,"[3, 8]","*Girl, Interrupted* (1999) is a well-known, big-star production that garnered an Oscar (best supporting actress Angelina Jolie).  A lot of reviews have been written about it.  All I want to do here is to point out what the film has to say for me.The story, set in 1967, focuses on a girl named Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) who's just graduated from high school and doesn't know what to do with the rest of her life.  She's suffering a quiet nightmare at home with her parents.  She's become intimate with a neighboring  professor, a married man.  For Susanna it was an experiment, something to try out once.  But her amorous professor wants to keep the affair going, secretly of course.  Susanna  feels put upon by his attentions...and a little guilty, a little dirty.  The world outside looks crazy to her with the Vietnam war raging and people of her generation freaking out on drugs.Susanna's looking for an escape.  Blessed with a writer's imagination, she turns inward to her thoughts.  There she finds high strangeness.  Time gets disordered.  One night the bones in her hand just vanish.  Finally she swallows a bottleful of aspirin with a bottleful of vodka--but she's not sure why.  This act convinces her parents and their psychiatrist friend that she's suicidal.  So it's off to Claymoore for Susanna.Claymoore is an upscale mental hospital, a tony nuthouse.  She rooms with a girl who reads Wizard of Oz books over and over.  Susanna begins a journal, a book of her own to lose herself in.  Thus even in Claymoore she finds ways to withdraw deeper and deeper into her imagination.  Susanna is dissociative (which means she separates herself from the world around her), but she's not crazy.  At least, not yet.What is crazy?  That's the ""big question"" that *Girl, Interrupted* explores.  In her journal Susanna comes up with a tempting insight: being crazy is an amplification of certain traits we all have.  For example, everybody at some times tells lies.  But if you tell lies all the time, that's crazy (her roommate is in Claymoore for being a pathological liar).  Now, if the point of *Girl, Interrupted* is to explore the question, ""What is real craziness?"", then at least in my view of the movie, Susanna's theory of amplification is only a starting point. After all, in the taxi ride to the hospital, the driver suggests that John Lennon could be hospitalized because his fantasies are amplified.  ""I'm not John Lennon,"" Susanna replies.  So her amplification idea isn't all that worked out.*Girl, Interrupted* does not explicitly answer what craziness really is.  It seems to leave the question open.  (After all, open-endedness, or to put it more bluntly, fear of commitment, is endemic to our modern culture.)  But implicitly the film tells us that as long as you can work the system, you're basically OK.  Thing is, there are two systems: the one outside Claymoore and the one within.  If you can work either one, you're not crazy--even though you may be ""diag-nonsensed"" as such by psychiatric authorities.I think that of the main characters, it's Daisy Randone (Brittany Murphey) who is really crazy.  She obviously can't cope being in Claymoore.  She's friendless.  She keeps herself shut up in her room, a No Tresspassing sign on the door.  She refuses to eat with the other women.  She lives only on chicken that comes to her room from her father's deli.  We don't learn about Daisy's mother; she doesn't seem to figure at all.  Mr. Randone, apparently, treats his daughter as his wife--even sexually.  Anyway, it turns out that Daisy gets an ""in recovery"" release from Claymoore.  Not because she got better, but because her doctors gave up.  Her father sets her up in an apartment where she can live in her own little world of chicken in the fridge and wicker butterflies on the wall.  In short, Daisy can't work the system outside Claymoore either.  She can't do anything for herself.  She's just a pet, ""the cocker spaniel that eats spaghetti.""In a scene that's become famous to *Girl, Interrupted*, Daisy ends up killing herself.Lisa Rowe (Angelina Jolie) is diag-nonsensed a sociopath.  But if being crazy means the inability to cope with the system, she is not that.  Lisa moves (by escaping and being returned) from Claymoore to the world outside and back.  In either system she knows how to take care of herself and thus remain very much her own person.Lisa is dissociative in the sense that she doesn't fit for long in any world.  But her dissociation is visceral, unlike Susanna's, which is intellectual.  Lisa is chased from one world to another and back by her flaming rage.  (It's curious, though, that in the deleted scenes feature of the DVD, we get a glimpse of a book and some papers on Lisa's bed.  The book (ah...books are symbols in this movie) appears to be about math.  It looks as if Lisa's been working on equations.  Thus she may have her own intellectual ivory tower that from time to time she escapes into.  Well, Jolie characters are often full of surprises!)In a talk therapy session, Dr. Melvin Potts asks Susanna why she looks puzzled.  Her answer is that she can't understand why she's in this place full of crazy people.  He asks her if this means she wants to go back home to her family.  ""Same problem,"" she replies.  The lesson of *Girl, Interrupted* seems to be that the problem is really Susanna's alone.  She's become so dissociative that there's a danger her tenuous link to both Claymoore and ""normal"" society may snap.  THAT would be crazy.It's ironic that Lisa, the sociopath, halts Susanna's drift into the Daisy-zone of utter helplessness.  Of all the inmates of the women's ward, Lisa is the manipulative charge-taker.  Her way of getting the people around her out of their headtrips and down to business serves as a healthy kick in the butt for Susanna.  The difficulty is that the business Lisa gets down to is self-destructive, though at the get-go it seems like fun.  It takes Daisy's suicide to drive this home to Susanna.  Thereafter Susanna takes charge of her own life and gets down to the business of earning her release.I think that in the touching scene at the end, where we watch Susanna paint Lisa's nails (Lisa's in the isolation room under four-point restraints), Susanna is as much thanking Lisa for the good she did as she is saying goodbye.  Lisa sobs, ""I'm gonna miss you, Suzie Q""--but Susanna's reply is a firm reminder that Lisa is not really crazy.  She has what it takes to get out.  She's not helpless.  She knows how to work the system.As she sighs in assent, Lisa's teary eyes turn away from Susanna to gaze off into her own thoughts.  The impression here is that Lisa is reflecting on the life she's chosen for herself.  Perhaps this is the first time she's facing the fact that it's not somebody else's fault she's confined to a mental institution.  Therefore, in turn, it won't be somebody else's credit when she's released.  Lisa's fate is in Lisa's own hands.*Girl, Interrupted* is one of those few movies that still gets a hold on me no matter how many times I've seen it. I give it five stars just for that--even though I don't much care for the confrontation scene between Susanna and Lisa in the Claymoore basement.  I mean, the basic idea of a confrontation is OK, but Susanna's reaction isn't.  Lisa swiped her journal and is reading it aloud to a couple other girls--so what?  That journal is the record of Susanna's journey through Claymoore...and tomorrow she's getting out.  If she's really better now, if the content of that journal (the book of her flirtation with madness) is really behind her, why does Susanna get all upset and hiss at Lisa, ""That's mine!""?I suppose the scriptwriters would reply that her reaction shows that Susanna still has a button in her psyche that Lisa can push.  The only way she can get free is to pass through the dramatic emotional catharsis that this scene plays out between the two protagonists.  Sorry, it's not convincing.  After a screaming run through the dark corridors, Susanna whirls and shouts at Lisa that she's just dead inside and needs Claymoore to feel alive.  Lisa abruptly collapses, bawling like a wounded calf.  Suddenly everything's OK.  Yeah, right.I'd prefer to have seen Susanna keep her cool as she patiently explains to Lisa that her journal contains private thoughts coming from a time of Susanna's utter confusion--a time she was locked up in the crazy house!  I think Lisa would have lost it anyway, because in effect Susanna would be telling her, ""Hey girl, that journal is full of crazy sh*t, and if you take it as seriously as you are now, it just means you're nuts.""  Plus by keeping her cool, Susanna would show Lisa that she's stronger than her.  Lisa would take that as a threat.  She'd be enraged and attack, injure Susanna's hand for her, and end up in isolation.  The scene of Susanna coming the next day to paint Lisa's fingernails would have carried even more power than it does.  It would emphasize all the more that Susanna is, at one and the same time, putting away all the madness she found in Claymoore, and keeping with her all the good.",5,Working the System,1121904000,"07

15476,A228JH8V9Y700G,0767819586,MortensOrchid,"[0, 0]","This movie was supposed to be a sort of comeback for Winona Ryder, after several years of a career lull, who produced and starred in this film.  It turned into the break through performance for Angelina Jolie, who got the praise for the sociopathic Lisa that culminated into an Academy Award (her pre Brangelina life).  Aside from this hype and the unexpected shift of attention, this is a movie that makes you think.Winona Ryder plays Susanna Kaysen, who was hospitalized for a year in a psychiatric hospital after attempting suicide at age 18.  While in the hospital, she meets other patients and lives the life of an institutionalized ""crazy person"".  TV, popping pills, playing games, writing, smoking cigarettes, sleeping, talking to nurses and doctors, etc.  There are some wonderful moments of humor (the ice cream shop trip), horrifying scenes (screaming and fighting), and a few moments of friendship and bonding.  Even in this terrible place they can find some common ground and become friendly.What does this tell us?  Is it just a hilarious portrayal of people who cannot cope?  Is it a sad profile of people who cannot function in the outside world?  It's more than that.  It's a story about being shattered on the inside and repairing yourself.  Susanna was able to put the pieces back together and reenter society while Lisa and Polly and Georgianna and the others were not able to do it.  Lisa is the one in command, she is so sociopathic and evil that she has no consideration for others save for herself.  There is more to life than what is going on within you and your problems, but when those problems overcome you, you sometimes fall apart.When someone insulted me once, I came back at them with the same rant that Lisa did in the ice cream shop.

15482,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,0767819586,Only-A-Child,"[5, 6]","If you are a prospective viewer or buyer of ""Girl, Interrupted"", don't be mislead by the many comparisons to ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", other than the setting in a mental hospital there is little similarity. There is little similarity between the two hospitals and no reason to believe that the ""movie"" adaptation of Kesey's book influenced ""Susanna Kaysen's"" autobiographical story. If you are looking for a film to predict your reaction a much better choice would be ""Ordinary People"". It is fairly safe to say that if you enjoyed that film you will be entertained by ""Girl, Interrupted"".Although the film was inspired by Kaysen's actual experiences and is told from her point of view (her character is played by Winona Ryder), it is really more allegorical than real; with general themes about freedom, individualism, conformity, and expectations. Unlike ""Cuckoo's Nest"" the villain is not the system but our own internal demons; ""we have met the enemy and he is us"".This is an ensemble piece and in trying to be character inclusive the film must sacrifice a lot of character depth and development. A really good director would grasp this problem and invent ways to compensate; fleshing out characters with visual behaviors and filling the frame with faces and eyes, including extensive reaction shots. Unfortunately, director James Mangold is pretty much clueless and the absence of tight shots and subtle characterization distances the viewer from the characters and makes it hard to identify or connect.Still the story is compelling enough to engage most viewers and there are enough stereotypes to just fill in the blanks yourself about several characters. For example, the Julie (Angela Bettis) character, a thin ballerina with an eating disorder, needs little supplemental background information and Angela can just get on with things that move along the storyline.Kaysen's take on herself and her fellow patients is interesting. Everyone sees little purple men, but you only get locked up for it if you complain about it (insert not conforming here). Then like Dorothy in Oz you can always go home by pronouncing yourself willing to conform, since there was never anything wrong (at least relative to everyone else) in the first place. Diagnosed with a Borderline Personality Disorder, Kaysen's real danger is becoming too comfortable in the sheltered environment of the institution to want to go home. Her thoughts of suicide seem rather silly to her after she is actually confronted with death.A borderline personality is appropriate for the theme of the story because apparently the psychological community is still uncertain about whether such a classification is even valid. The vague description is of a person born with a tendency to react more intensely to lower levels of stress than others and to take longer to recover; peaking emotionally on less provocation and taking longer coming down (which probably describes almost everyone that you know).The patients in her ward are messed up in a variety of ways, if the girls in my high school had been this interesting I probably would have married one. Most have found a home in the institution and have little desire to leave. One (Lisa-Angelina Jolie) is manipulatively dangerous with no conscience. She periodically escapes but always returns to sadistically pick on and push the buttons of her captive audience inside. Another (Brittney Murphy) is truly a psychological basket case, of course she is the first one to be released.Winona does a good job with this role but it does not offer her that much, as the nature of the story requires that Susanna be played in a very constrained way. She is a little too old for the role and her style of playing her characters realistically hurts your perception of her acting when everyone else is carrying on in a expressionistic overplay.Murphy and Whoopi Goldberg (she plays a perceptive RN) really shine. I'm puzzled by the amount of praise Jolie's performance has received. She is fine in the role but there is nothing difficult here, mostly she just plays herself and occasionally looks like she would enjoy pulling the wings off a few flies. Bettis and Murphy could have handled the role just as well while Jolie would have struggled with their parts.Then again, what do I know?

Also, I've seen so many films set in mental hospitals in this country and in others, that somehow they've all run together in my memory.This story resembles many of the others. Someone is diagnosed as mentally ill, goes into a hospital, has adventures with the inmates, who are usually sympathetic, and the staff, who are usually portrayed as villains.  In this case, it's a smart, sensitive girl, who wants to be a writer, from a wealthy family, who hates her mother, doesn't fit in with the program.  It's the 60's, and we see references to Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, there's a draft dodger on his way to Canada, a VW bus and everyone smokes cigarettes, takes drugs and sleeps around.  So what's new?What makes this film worth seeing, to me, is the blockbuster performance of Angelina Jolie.  I've seen her in many of her more recent films in which she was very good but in this one she really pulled out all of the stops.  It's not just that she played ""crazy"" real well; that's not all that hard to do.  But she had so much heart and soul and humor---I really pulled for her character and felt very sad that, in the end, the rather lackluster Ryder character was pronounced ""healed"" and got to go home, while Jolie was last seen strapped to her bed.I don't think this was the aim of the scriptwriter, the director, or certainly of Ryder, who co-produced it.

Well I can tell you it was a grand waste of time and considering this film deals with some of my best interests at heart, it was one of the most boring affairs I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. We start off with the character played by Winona Ryder. She apparently tried to kill her self with...aspirin. Yeah that's right, a whole bottle in fact! That caused me to loose all respect for her immediately. I mean what type of a retard over doses on aspirin for God sakes. A combination of Sleeping pills and tranquilizers would have been more efficient, with a stomach lining tablet first to prevent vomiting. Of course there's the popular paracetamol, but it normally gives you around two weeks to die, during which your skin turns yellow as your vital organs fail. Oh and the Looney bin. Well of course you have your run of the mill inhabitants e.g. the childish one, the fat one, the compulsive liar, the eating disorder and of course Angelina Jolie, our prize inmate. Of course its madness by numbers: The insane grin, hysterical laughing, the wacky hair etc. It's just so predictable.Don't mention the fact that the majority of the clinically insane are quite shy meek mannered individuals. It is only when you get to really know them that their `weirdness' becomes apparent. I for one lived a whole year with a compulsive liar when I was 13. Told me she was dying of bone cancer. Went for a check up at the conveniently far away hospital every other week, or so she lead me to believe. Unfortunately it turned out she was a compulsive thief as well. Whoops just a little too late. Anyway back to the film. Why is Winona here with all these lunatics? Okay so she's depressed. Aww! Poor baby, aren't we all. Let's wallow in our self pity. I didn't get to university, boo hoo. I mean that's a lot worse then getting molested as a child or watching you mother kill herself in front of you. Like my best friend did. She's has bipolar depression and is a developing alcoholic but she struggles on. Oh and the whole cutting scene that some people have labelled disturbing. Hahahahahah!  The trade mark shallow diagonal lines up the arm. Could serious self harmers be more insulted? Perhaps that's why I'm so angry at this film.  Anyway, buy this if your looking for the obvious and the clich&eacute;. I guess I'm just sick of the constant stereotyping. Not a real look into to any of the mental problems presented here. Right!

15494,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0767819586,Reviewer,"[4, 4]","Some outstanding performances (including one Oscar winner) highlight this story of a young woman who loses a year of her life incarcerated in a mental hospital, mainly due to society's penchant at the time for institutionalizing even the borderline mentally infirm.  ""Girl, Interrupted,"" directed by James Mangold, is the story (based on her autobiography) of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), a young aspiring writer suffering from depression.  After what may or may not have been a suicide attempt (she chases a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka), she is spirited off to a private mental hospital, where she is diagnosed as having a ""borderline personality defect.""  Simply put, it means she is young, intelligent and having trouble coping with an era (the `60s) and a world in a state of flux, as well as the pressure from her parents and peers to attend an upscale university.  Susanna, however, wants only to live life and write, and though she knows her own mind in this regard, the forces that surround her are too great, and she is torn between what she wants, and what the ""world"" expects.  All of which leads her into some gray areas in which time and space as she knows it suddenly does not necessarily coincide with the continuum of reality.A powerful film that makes a statement about tolerance and the methods of treatment available for the mentally ill, it underscores the necessity for compassion and understanding of those unable to function on their own.  And it successfully illustrates that in dealing with people in need, there must be a humanistic approach, as  it is more involved than merely separating the wheat from the chaff.As Susanna, Winona Ryder gives a performance that is both affecting and intense; she readily conveys the angst of a young woman confused, yet determined, who has yet to learn one of life's most valuable lessons:  Make the decision.  Susanna has been walking a fence that gets narrower with each step she takes, until finally, her fall to either one side or the other was inevitable.  What she had yet to learn at that point, was that it is better to stop before you reach the end of the fence, so as to be able to decide for yourself which way you're going to fall.  That way, for better or worse, at least you know that ""you've"" made the decision that's going to affect your life, which makes it easier to live with.  Susanna could have saved herself a lot of misery had she stated unequivocally to her parents, and most importantly to herself, that after High School graduation ""this"" is what I am going to do.  A hard concept to grasp, however, when one is eighteen and being pulled in opposite directions at the same time.In her Oscar winning performance, Angelina Jolie proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that, indeed, there is substance beneath the beauty.  As Lisa, the sociopath with an ice cube for a heart, she brings an enigmatic, intimidating presence to the screen.  A soulless miscreant, she thrives within the confines of the institution by bullying her way through every day of her life.  On the ""outside,"" however, she finds repeatedly that the bravura that works for her in confinement attracts only the kind of attention that gets her sent back again.  It's a dynamic, over-the-top, in-your-face performance for which she deservedly received the award for Best Supporting Actress.  And, hopefully, after proving here what she is truly capable of, Jolie's career will successfully transcend her looks and that already famous pair of lips (though following this effort with the stagnating ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" does not bode well).The supporting cast includes Clea DuVall (Georgina), Brittany Murphy (Daisy), Elisabeth Moss (Polly), Jared Leto (Tobias), Jeffrey Tambor (Dr. Potts), Vanessa Redgrave (Dr. Wick), Whoopi Goldberg (Valerie), Mary Kay Place (Mrs. Gilcrest), Kurtwood Smith (Dr. Crumble) and Angela Bettis (Janet).  A somewhat disturbing film, ""Girl, Interrupted"" will affect you on any number of emotional levels and will command, not only your attention, but your involvement.  Simply put, this is riveting drama that refuses to let you off the hook for even a moment.  There's a message in here about the perspectives and significance of society as a whole, but more importantly, about the impact an individual can make on our world and the people around us, and of the importance of forging ahead and making a decision before it's too late.",4,One Girl On The Edge Of Darkness,985564800,"03 26, 2001",2001,4428,"['outstanding', 'performances', 'including', 'one', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'highlight', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'year', 'life', 'incarcerated', 'mental', 'hospital', 'mainly', 'due', 'society', 'penchant', 'time', 'institutionalizing', 'even', 'borderline', 'mentally', 'infirm', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'directed', 'James', 'Mangold', 'story', 'based', 'autobiography', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'young', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'suffering', 'depression', 'what', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'bottle', 'aspirin', 'bottle', 'vodka', 'spirited', 'off', 'private', 'mental', 'hospital', 'where', 'diagnosed', 'having', 'borderline', 'personality', 'defect', 'Simply', 'put', 'young', 'intelligent', 'having', 'trouble', 'coping', 'era', '60s', 'world', 'state', 'flux', 'as', 'well', 'pressure', 'parents', 'peers', 'attend', 'upscale', 'university', 'Susanna', 'however', 'only', 'live', 'life', 'write', 'own', 'mind', 'regard', 'forces', 'surround', 'are', 'too', 'great', 'torn', 'what', 'what', 'world', 'gray', 'areas', 'time', 'space', 'suddenly', 'not', 'necessarily', 'coincide', 'continuum', 'reality.A', 'powerful', 'film', 'statement', 'tolerance', 'methods', 'treatment', 'available', 'mentally', 'ill', 'necessity', 'compassion', 'understanding', 'unable', 'function', 'own', 'successfully', 'dealing', 'people', 'need', 'must', 'be', 'humanistic', 'approach', 'more', 'involved', 'merely', 'separating', 'wheat', 'chaff.As', 'Susanna', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'performance', 'affecting', 'intense', 'readily', 'conveys', 'angst', 'young', 'woman', 'confused', 'yet', 'determined', 'who', 'yet', 'learn', 'one', 'life', 'most', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'Make', 'decision', 'Susanna', 'been', 'walking', 'fence', 'narrower', 'step', 'finally', 'fall', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'was', 'inevitable', 'What', 'had', 'yet', 'learn', 'point', 'was', 'better', 'stop', 'reach', 'end', 'fence', 'so', 'be', 'able', 'decide', 'way', ""'re"", 'going', 'fall', 'way', 'better', 'worse', 'least', 'know', ""'ve"", 'made', 'decision', 'going', 'affect', 'life', 'easier', 'live', 'Susanna', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'lot', 'misery', 'had', 'stated', 'unequivocally', 'parents', 'most', 'importantly', 'herself', 'High', 'School', 'graduation', 'what', 'am', 'going', 'do', 'A', 'hard', 'concept', 'grasp', 'however', 'when', 'one', 'eighteen', 'being', 'pulled', 'opposite', 'directions', 'same', 'time.In', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'indeed', 'substance', 'beauty', 'Lisa', 'sociopath', 'ice', 'cube', 'heart', 'enigmatic', 'intimidating', 'presence', 'screen', 'soulless', 'miscreant', 'confines', 'institution', 'bullying', 'way', 'day', 'life', 'outside', 'however', 'repeatedly', 'bravura', 'confinement', 'only', 'kind', 'attention', 'sent', 'back', 'again', 'dynamic', 'over-the-top', 'in-your-face', 'performance', 'deservedly', 'received', 'award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'hopefully', 'proving', 'here', 'what', 'truly', 'capable', 'Jolie', 'career', 'will', 'successfully', 'transcend', 'looks', 'already', 'famous', 'pair', 'lips', 'following', 'effort', 'stagnating', 'Gone', '60', 'Seconds', 'not', 'bode', 'well', '.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Clea', 'DuVall', 'Georgina', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Daisy', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'Polly', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Tobias', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'Dr.', 'Potts', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Dr.', 'Wick', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Valerie', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Mrs.', 'Gilcrest', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'Dr.', 'Crumble', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'Janet', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'film', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'will', 'affect', 'number', 'emotional', 'levels', 'will', 'command', 'not', 'only', 'attention', 'involvement', 'Simply', 'put', 'riveting', 'drama', 'let', 'off', 'hook', 'even', 'moment', 'message', 'here', 'perspectives', 'significance', 'society', 'whole', 'more', 'importantly', 'impact', 'individual', 'can', 'make', 'world', 'people', 'importance', 'forging', 'ahead', 'making', 'decision', 'too', 'late']",N/A

She insists this wasn't a suicide attempt, but her parents and psychiatrist don't agree. While at Claymoore, Susanna meets the ohter inmates, Georgina (Clea Duvall), her roommate, who's a pathological liar, Polly (Elisabeth Moss), who everyone calls Torch and has been badly scarred by fire, Daisy (Britanny Murphy), who won't eat in front of anyone, Janet (Angela Bettis), who won't eat at all, and most importantly, Lisa (Angelina Jolie). Lisa is a sociopath. She constantly escapes Claymoore, only to return after having a crisis (or running out of money). She ""runs"" the place and is a major pain in the ass for Nurse Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg).Soon after, Susanna starts to wonder if she's indeed crazy or if she's turning crazy by being there. The doctors at Claymoore, Melvin (Jeffrey Tambor) and Dr. Wick (Vanessa Grave) seem to think she's mentally ill, while her boyfriend Toby (Jared Leto) disagrees.Susanna has to deal with the situation, trying not to spiral into insanity, but at the same time finding a substitute for a home amongst this group of rejects.As for the acting, it is solid all across the board. Ryder does a convincing job as the lead character and all of the other actresses shine in their roles, especially Murphy, but this is Jolie's film. She steals almost every scene she's in, from the distressed crying on one of her downs, to frighteningly mad outbursts, to maniac lunacy. She earned a well deserve Oscar for her supporting role.The director, James Mangold, has also helmed films like Cop Land (1997, with Sylvester Stallone, Robert DeNiro and Harvey Keitel), Kate & Leopold (2001, with Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan) and Identity (2003, with John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet).",4,"So, what's your diag-nonsense?",1074816000,"01 23, 2004",2004,1920,"['movie', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'who', 'was', 'admitted', 'Claymoore', 'mental', 'institution', 'late', '60', 'drowning', 'bottle', 'aspirin', 'bottle', 'vodka', 'was', ""n't"", 'suicide', 'attempt', 'parents', 'psychiatrist', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Claymoore', 'Susanna', 'ohter', 'Georgina', 'Clea', 'Duvall', 'roommate', 'who', 'pathological', 'liar', 'Polly', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'who', 'everyone', 'Torch', 'been', 'badly', 'scarred', 'fire', 'Daisy', 'Britanny', 'Murphy', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'eat', 'front', 'anyone', 'Janet', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'eat', 'most', 'importantly', 'Lisa', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Lisa', 'sociopath', 'constantly', 'Claymoore', 'only', 'return', 'having', 'crisis', 'running', 'money', 'runs', 'place', 'major', 'pain', 'ass', 'Nurse', 'Valerie', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', '.Soon', 'Susanna', 'wonder', 'indeed', 'crazy', 'turning', 'crazy', 'being', 'there', 'doctors', 'Claymoore', 'Melvin', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'Dr.', 'Wick', 'Vanessa', 'Grave', 'seem', 'think', 'mentally', 'ill', 'boyfriend', 'Toby', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'disagrees.Susanna', 'deal', 'situation', 'trying', 'not', 'spiral', 'insanity', 'same', 'time', 'finding', 'substitute', 'home', 'amongst', 'group', 'rejects.As', 'acting', 'solid', 'board', 'Ryder', 'convincing', 'job', 'lead', 'character', 'other', 'actresses', 'shine', 'roles', 'especially', 'Murphy', 'Jolie', 'film', 'almost', 'scene', 'distressed', 'crying', 'one', 'downs', 'frighteningly', 'mad', 'outbursts', 'maniac', 'lunacy', 'earned', 'well', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'supporting', 'role.The', 'director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'also', 'helmed', 'films', 'Cop', 'Land', '1997', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Kate', 'Leopold', '2001', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Identity', '2003', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Amanda', 'Peet']",N/A
15499,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0767819586,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 4]","The formula for `Girl, Interrupted' is to take the basic setting and plot situation of `One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,' strip them of their high-falutin' melodramatic elements and present a somewhat more realistic  image of insanity hidden behind the walls of a mental institution. The risk  in such a move is that the film will, also, strip away much of the drama as  well. `Girl, Interrupted' takes the risk and, perhaps predictably, is not a  completely satisfying effort as a result. Long stretches of the film turn  into drawn out gabfests in which the girls housed in this Massachusetts  institution talk out their issues at frequently excessive length. However,  thanks to strong performances by an impressive cast of highly talented  young actresses, as well as a script filled with occasionally sharp  insights into the complexities of mental illness, the film ultimately  yields a moving and rewarding cinematic experience for those with the  patience to see it through to the end.The film is based on the true-life  story of Susanna Kaysen, a young woman who, like many young people in the  turbulent 1960's, felt disoriented in the face of great social upheaval and  the redefining of traditional roles and came to question her own place in  society as a result. For a fumbled attempt at suicide, Susanna was  ultimately consigned to a yearlong stay at a New England psychiatric  hospital. It is her experiences there - and the relationships she forged  with other women in her ward - that form the backbone of the  film.Several elements serve to undercut some of the credibility of the  film. As overseen by an ever-sympathetic head nurse (Whoopi Goldberg), this  ward seems woefully lax in its standards of both discipline and security.  The girls seem to run freely and wildly through the corridors at all times,  popping in and out of each other's rooms, talking disrespectfully to the  staff on hand, entertaining strange young men in their rooms under direct  gaze of the people who work there and even bolting from the place entirely  with astonishing frequency. Moreover, the girls certainly do not seem to be  kept very busy with either chores or therapy sessions and, as a result, we  often wonder what exactly the therapeutic modus operandi of this hospital  is. In a weak echo of `Cuckoo's Nest,' the girls are taken out into a  public setting - an ice cream parlor - with predictably disastrous results.  Even worse in that scene is the confrontation that occurs between Susanna  and a friend of her parents who it seems has wised up to the fact that  Susanna and her husband once had a sexual fling. The incredibility is not  in the confrontation per se, but in the fact that this mother would make  such an embarrassingly public scene right in front of her own  understandably chagrined daughter.On the whole, however, the film sports  enough virtues of performances and writing to triumph over its flaws.  Winona Ryder, in what might well be her finest performance to date, conveys  the combination of melancholic wistfulness and hard-edged cynicism  essential to her essentially decent but deeply troubled character. Neither  the writers, Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan, nor writer/director  James Mangold ever allow us to bank on the extent of Susanna's madness.  Since she herself is never quite sure whether she is truly insane or just  deeply depressed and emotionally confused, we are never given the  opportunity to peg her with a pat diagnosis either. The same goes for her  fellow inmates, particularly Lisa, stunningly portrayed by Angelina Jolie,  whose often-lethal combination of beguiling charm and cold-blooded  ruthlessness, keeps us as off balance as it does Susanna.Certainly,  mental illness is one of the most difficult conditions to render credible  on the screen. The risks lie in either overstating the mannerisms and  actions into seeming absurdity or of providing resolutions that ring hollow  in their upbeat simplicity. `Girl, Interrupted' falls into both traps  occasionally, but the fact that it is a work culled from a real person's  personal experiences makes us more prone to accept it at face value. At  times the girls seem too facile in their respective natures - one is a  pathological liar, one a repressed lesbian, one a deceitful sociopath, one  a self-deluded incest victim etc. - yet each character also contains her  personal element of truth and validity. Only Whoopi Goldberg's anti-Nurse  Ratched character rings untrue. Perhaps Goldberg has simply gone once too  often to this particular well - that of the overly sympathetic authority  figure dripping heartfelt sincerity all over the miserable and the hurting.  As an actress, she has long ago lost her edge.Still, for all its  weaknesses, `Girl, Interrupted' emerges as a genuinely poignant and moving  study of a group of hurting individuals groping towards each other for hope  and understanding. For all the voices of reason shouting at us to question  its authenticity, we find ourselves wanting desperately to believe in this  unusual and thought-provoking tale",3,flawed but rewarding

Thankfully this story is not just about Susanna, it's about the other girls in the ward, and watching them heal or just finding out why they're there. Its about finding out that some scars never heal, they only hurt worse everyday. And some of us are already dead on the inside.There were a few unbelievable bits to this movie, like how wards are managed. Then again this is based in 50's so things might have been run differently back then. Still I found some of it unbelievable.I loved watching Susanna grow out of her disease even though she never fully understood what it was, just that she wasn't normal.

15511,ANA2PVMARGY8H,0767819586,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[4, 4]","I absolutely loved Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, and this movie is set within McLean Psychiatric Hospital, the same hospital Sylvia Plath sojourned in during the 1950s. So, I was predisposed to like, if not love, this movie. Yet my overall impression was mixed, fairly positive, but more lukewarm than I had anticipated. I did like many aspects of the movie: top-notch acting; the theme that we are all somewhat borderline (like Susanna's diagnosis), a spectrum of dysfunctionality in a dysfunctional world; some of Susanna's insights; Whoopi Goldberg's character, and Ryder's special features commentary that no one is immune to a ""visit,"" brief or prolonged, at McLean.Other aspects were downright disturbing. So many reviewers commented about how Lisa (Angelina Jolie) said it like it was, ""the truth-telling sociopath.""  How she treated Daisy (Britney Murphy) wasn't truth-telling; it was a combination of transference, projection, and blaming the victim, completely devoid of empathy.  I always thought that sociopaths were like Ted Bundy and Hitler, but Lisa didn't seem to be that type of threat to society.  Despite how cruel she could be, Lisa showed softer feelings and protested to Susanna that she really wasn't dead (emotionally).  I couldn't help but feel sorry for this character.  Susanna does see Lisa as a warning for what our protagonist could become if she doesn't get better. However, Susanna has a completely different diagnosis, so the psychiatric ward longevity and self-destructive behavior would be the real danger of the similarity.  Despite how mesmerized Susanna was by Lisa and how close the two of them were, I never thought that this movie developed/captured this relationship to that extent.  If the movie had retained some of the deleted scenes, maybe this closeness would have been more convincing.The acting was really intense. Ryder, with her large, luminous eyes, drew us in to the self-reflective and indecisive Susanna.  Jolie didn't hold back with her interpretation of Lisa: her virtuosic display of nuanced angst and unbridled anger was Oscar caliber. And I just wanted to comfort Britney Murphy's Daisy.Whoopi Goldberg stole the show in all her scenes. When Susanna was baiting her with racially charged diatribe, this nurse had the sense not to take it personally.  She continued to encourage Susanna by telling her she wasn't going to be a long-term patient and gave her some sound advice and feedback.This movie seemed a bit disjointed (and I'm not referring to the movie's heavy use of flashbacks), but hey, maybe that was purposely done to represent the lack of order and coherence felt by the institutionalized young women (and the young people of that generation).This movie didn't move me like The Bell Jar, but it did move me.  It had some beautiful moments and keen insights.  If its overall effect is to inspire compassion for the mentally ill, then I cannot complain. This movie makes a good point about how Bell Jars come in different sizes, shapes, and distortions.

And what a difference between the two. I'm not going to list them  because I want you to read the book for yourself.  The movie is about  Suzanna Kaysen (played by an amazing Winona Ryder) who was sent to an  asylum. There she meets a host of characters including Lisa, which has got  to be Angelina Jolie's best performance as far as I'm concerned, who is a  diagnosed sociopath. She also meets Polly, a sweetnatured woman who burned  the side of her face at age 10, Georgia, a compulsive liar, and Daisy, a  girl addicted to laxatives and her father's chicken.  This story isn't for  the meek, that's for sure. And it's definately NOT for children!

I consider any fiction on the topic to be a mere sliver of what really goes on behind such closed doors, this being even more the case in the repressed climate of the 1960s.  Set in Claymoore, a private mental hospital for young women, the prevailing curiosity of the film is determining if the girls are truly ill, or if they just don't adhere to the morays of the era.  In most cases it seems to be a bit of both, the level of tragedy as compelling in either.The story is told from the perspective of Susanna, Ryder's character, who is certainly suffering from depression and repression.  As Susanna endures the bumps of settling in we are introduced to the girls on her ward.  She also establishes relationships with the facility's staff, namely a nurse played by Whoopi Goldberg, who certainly fills a mentor role for Susanna.  Being the narrative bridge between these two worlds establishes Susanna as a reasonably reliable perspective for us to get a glimpse into these womens' lives.  Some are there to cope with behaviours stemming from abuse, tragedy, and deeply seated psychotic imbalance.  We navigate those waters with Susanna as their stories are divulged.  However, as she learns more about them she becomes more caught up in their processes, somewhat losing sight of her own.  In the end she has to decide between finally feeling at home among peers and the balanced instruction of her keepers, against working to heal and leave the ward.The story is compelling and edgy, though not nearly as enthralling as I'd hoped.  The writing is well done, though the acting feels somewhat stiff from most of the cast--Ryder in particular.  This role does not seem to be a far stretch from many of her quirky 'ultra-femme needing to find herself' roles.  The soundtrack is an interesting combo,too.

As for the film itself, it obviously strives to be a female version of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; but the film never attains the impact of the classic because it's muddled and directionless.  And the dialogue is clunky to boot.  This is the type of movie where characters are constructed by giving them situations in which they have to argue and throw out descriptive accusations/criticisms at one another.  There are a number of moments when the film becomes profound -- such as the examination of how certain actions from boys are perceived as rebellious but the same actions from a girl would be considered insane.  I also liked Vanessa Redgrave's monologue about the fine line between sanity and insanity -- that insanity is really just the overindulgence of one's own preoccupations.

The book, I thought, had much more of a poetic feel about it than this movie cared to let in on. Yes, the story is mainly focused on  Susanna Kaysen's stay in the mental institution that housed other famous  names in the past, but people are missing the point to what the title means  and how she weaves that meaning into the definition of her own sickness.  Those who have read the book will know what I'm talking about (the  painting) and will agree with me when I say that some part of that  should've been incorporated into the story.Instead, the movie focused  on its primary stars. Winona, who is a beautiful face and can always  maintain that enigmatic glow no matter how bad she looks, and the Morticia  Adams of the Oscars' Angelina Jolie, who opted for a terrible-looking but  suitable bleach-blonde style for her portrayal of Lisa, the feisty and  emotionally-detached socialite. Yes, Angie was good, but I don't think the  Oscar should've gone to her in this case, seeing as how there were far  better performances last year that should've made the list but didn't. This  movie survived off of the names that were in it more than what the story  was really about. All of the other actors that portrayed patients in the  hospital were exceptional. They should've been looked over more carefully,  if you ask me. Then maybe they would've made the list instead of Angelina.  Yes, they had less lines, but their performances were more focused. Jolie  is keen for characters that are rebellious and reckless, but I don't think  that performance in particular was one in a million. If you want to see her  in a role similar in nature, then watch the HBO Original movie  &quot;Gia&quot;. Now that's a noteworthy performance by Jolie.Anyhoo,  Ryder did her part well, but there's the hint of too much subtlety at  times. The only real time I saw a more accurate representation of what her  character must be feeling is when the head nurse dumps Ryder into a tub  filled with ice cold water. She then begins screaming and tries to tip the  nurse's emotional scales by hitting a nerve with all the derragatory terms  she throws left and right. Naturally, when people have an advanced  emotional condition, they will try to pull someone else down into the  depths with them. That scene was an example of Susanna letting loose her  demons onto an innocent by-stander, especially someone who's trying to help  her.All in all, I left the theater feeling satisfied, but I could've  done without the melodramatic ending. It just didn't seem to fit with the  rest of the movie. Of course, most people say that the book is always  better than the movie, but I'm trying to give this one a chance by making  an honest comparison. This was a very good adaptation, but could've used a  little more poetic and artistic direction and  more insight into the minds  of the mentally ill.",4,"Very Good Representation, But Lacking In...",958435200,"05 16, 2000",2000,2963,"['poetry', 'poor', 'sense', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'be', 'struggling', 'mental', 'illness', 'book', 'thought', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'poetic', 'feel', 'movie', 'cared', 'let', 'Yes', 'story', 'mainly', 'focused', 'Susanna', 'Kaysen', 'stay', 'mental', 'institution', 'housed', 'other', 'famous', 'names', 'past', 'people', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'what', 'title', 'how', 'meaning', 'definition', 'own', 'sickness', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'painting', 'will', 'agree', 'when', 'say', 'part', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'incorporated', 'story.Instead', 'movie', 'focused', 'primary', 'stars', 'Winona', 'who', 'beautiful', 'face', 'can', 'always', 'maintain', 'enigmatic', 'glow', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'Morticia', 'Adams', 'Oscars', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'who', 'opted', 'terrible-looking', 'suitable', 'bleach-blonde', 'style', 'portrayal', 'Lisa', 'feisty', 'emotionally-detached', 'socialite', 'Yes', 'Angie', 'was', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Oscar', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'case', 'seeing', 'how', 'were', 'far', 'better', 'performances', 'last', 'year', 'should', ""'ve"", 'made', 'list', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'survived', 'names', 'were', 'more', 'what', 'story', 'was', 'really', 'about', 'other', 'actors', 'portrayed', 'patients', 'hospital', 'were', 'exceptional', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looked', 'more', 'carefully', 'ask', 'Then', 'maybe', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'list', 'instead', 'Angelina', 'Yes', 'had', 'less', 'lines', 'performances', 'were', 'more', 'focused', 'Jolie', 'keen', 'characters', 'are', 'rebellious', 'reckless', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'performance', 'particular', 'was', 'one', 'million', 'want', 'see', 'role', 'similar', 'nature', 'then', 'watch', 'HBO', 'Original', 'movie', 'quot', 'Gia', 'quot', 'Now', 'noteworthy', 'performance', 'Jolie.Anyhoo', 'Ryder', 'did', 'part', 'well', 'hint', 'too', 'much', 'subtlety', 'times', 'only', 'real', 'time', 'saw', 'more', 'accurate', 'representation', 'what', 'character', 'must', 'be', 'feeling', 'when', 'head', 'nurse', 'dumps', 'Ryder', 'tub', 'filled', 'ice', 'cold', 'water', 'then', 'screaming', 'tries', 'tip', 'nurse', 'emotional', 'scales', 'hitting', 'nerve', 'derragatory', 'terms', 'left', 'right', 'Naturally', 'when', 'people', 'have', 'advanced', 'emotional', 'condition', 'will', 'try', 'pull', 'someone', 'else', 'down', 'depths', 'scene', 'was', 'example', 'Susanna', 'letting', 'loose', 'demons', 'innocent', 'by-stander', 'especially', 'someone', 'who', 'trying', 'help', 'her.All', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', 'satisfied', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'melodramatic', 'ending', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'rest', 'movie', 'course', 'most', 'people', 'say', 'book', 'always', 'better', 'movie', ""'m"", 'trying', 'give', 'one', 'chance', 'making', 'honest', 'comparison', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'little', 'more', 'poetic', 'artistic', 'direction', 'more', 'insight', 'minds', 'mentally', 'ill']",N/A

I sunk low into my chair and from the first note of the music I knew that I was about to be transported. Growing up in Pennsylvania in the 70's is one thing, watching it all over again on film can be disturbing, chilling and haunting. 'Girl Interrupted' captured that old world feeling that is now gone forever with amazing clarity.I am not an emotional person, but being there in that theater alone, the close up after close up of Winona Ryder, the music and the hypnotic dialog brought tears down my face on more than one occasion. Vanessa Redgrave's acting was flawless, listening to the sound of her voice against that music interpreting a Carl Jung existence for Winona's Susanna Kayson was worth the price of admission itself.The reality of institutionalized living has been captured. The people that get caught up in these 'total' environments are as far ranging as this film clearly describes. What a great message.I want to state for the record that I feel Winona Ryder should have won an award not just for her acting but her capable style in production.

It has all of the elements that make up a superior movie, and i am truly shocked it didn't win 'Best Picture' at the Academy Awards (let alone get nominated).I first saw this movie on t.v. late at night as i was flipping through channels. I had looked it up in the t.v. guide and read that Winona Ryder (my fav. actress) was in it. I was debating between it and ""Saturday Night Live"". Thank GOD i chose ""G.I.""This movie is my all time favorite in the midst of my comedy collection. The book is good also, but i enjoyed the movie far more.It hits on a lot of subjects that you normally don't find in movies. The acting was incredible. Not only Winona, but Brittany Murphy, Whoopie Golberg, and Angleina Jolie. The suicide scene was amazingly acted. Right after that scene, it went into a commercial, and my jaw was hanging open for all of it.if you were looking for a recommendation, you can probably tell already that im going to give it a good review, but hear (read) this: ""Girl"" is not for the timid. Although it is a masterpiece, i can almost guarentee it'll have you shaking a few times. I strongly recommend it for people with a ""fine"" taste in films, Ryder/Murphy/Jolie fans, and just anyone who needs some excellent entertainment. I've also found that it's not just a girls movie.

15534,A28H4XP8R5EV4L,0767819586,the king of DVDs,"[4, 16]","In a movie that is 127 minutes long, we should be given a clear explanation of why Winona Ryder's character belongs in a mental hospital. Instead, we're thrown into the middle of everything, when her parents are considering the option of admitting her into the insane asylum.The predictability of &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; doesn't help itself at all. Of course, she doesn't think that she belongs in a ward, even though she admitted to her doctor that she swallowed an entire carton of aspirin, and that was before she drank a bottle of vodka, all because she had a headache. All movies in this category (and believe me, there are more than you would think) have the inmate going through a period of denial leading up to an eventual feeling of belonging.The character development behind almost everyone in &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; ended up being another very weak link, and, in a very dark drama that is based on a true story, this is a critical element that just isn't up to par, and that really hurts it. Like I said earlier, we need to know why Winona Ryder's character is going through this stage of depression, and we need to know what part of the phase is so unbearable that she can't handle it on her own. I remember the word &quot;blue&quot; being used when her feelings were being described, and that word falls short of description that would constitute someone needing to go to a mental institution. In a big world like this, there are people that aren't able to cope with certain things all by themselves, and that is what her character is supposed to evoke. In reality, I know of two people who have been through experiences in life that were too difficult to be dealt with alone, and, when the topic of the drama that they are going through comes up, the word &quot;blue&quot; wouldn't be enough to describe what they were going through. She is playing a 17-18 year old (even though she was 28 during the filming) in 1967 who is dealing with the problems that everyone faces at that age. Everyone faces those problems, and everyone deals with them. It's a little thing called the real world, and, if her character can't adjust to it, then I, as the viewer, don't care whether or not she gets over her problem or not, because it all comes off as a bunch of complaining.Acting wasn't good either. Angelina Jolie was supposed to appear to be insane, but her character was really just an idiot, which is completely different from insanity. Jack Nicholson in &quot;The Shining&quot; is insanity; Angelina Jolie in &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; is an idiot. At one point in the movie, an inmate told someone to call her a cab, and he called her cab, as it were a name, and she went bizerk, laughing. Insane? No. Idiotic? Very.So, overall, I have enough real problems and complaints now, and I don't need to hear the petty, superficial ones that are poorly portrayed in this movie. If I were anything like anyone in this movie, then I would go crazy every time I had the most subtle, unthreatening problem. Stay away from this movie.

But I have read Kaysen's memoir many times and was dissapointed at how far the story line strayed and the inaccuracies between the film and her memoir.However the performances were flawless! The first time I saw the film (opening night in the theatre) I was really irritated seeing how far the movie's story line strayed from the memoirs. I was expecting something more exact with all the fanfare Winonna Ryder gave in her interviews as a producer, she was very concerned with protecting the integrity of the memoirs. Which was a large draw for me to go see the film.The film didn't turn Kaysen's memoirs into fluff or take the intensity out of it, but you do loose a lot with this rendition.Just for a beginning, in Kaysen's memoirs, she had taken the bottle of asprin over a year before she was committed to the hospital. Which really was important to the story, the doctor had just put her in for a &quot;rest&quot; feeling her to be depressed. Which was very critical to the &quot;story&quot; as Susanna really did not understand why she was in there and many people would argue did not need need to be hospitalized (at that time). And the incident with biting her hand to try to see if she had bones, that had happened after they found out Daisy was dead. Whose house they had of course never been to. And Lisa was NEVER allowed off grounds to the ice cream parlour!! The list goes on and on and on.... And I found this to be upsetting because her memoir wasn't fiction, there were no &quot;characters&quot; in it and to lose such vital information was really a shame.I understand that all of this was needed for character development and to keep the movie from turning into a mini series. (Which actualyl I would not have minded). And it did make a GREAT movie. But, if you are looking to buy this film, or rent it hoping it is a closer rendition of Kaysen's memoirs (as I did) you will be very dissapointed.The first time I saw it, I was almost fixated on finding the flaws and the differences between it and Kaysen's book.

15537,A1JNKGC3C6OVGQ,0767819586,"Ujjwal Dey ""2write""","[0, 0]","Girl, InterruptedI first saw this movie back in 2002 on a free VCD I had got. I remember buying it simply because Winona Ryder was in it, not knowing anything about the movie at all. At that first viewing it was pretty shocking and I put it away not to see it for a second time until today.It is a wonderful movie, describing the anguish of a group of females in their youth, in a mental institution; particularly that of the narrator and protagonist Susanna Kaysen. She is in here because she had a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka. She wasn't suicidal, just had a headache and so disagrees with the opinion of being in a mental institute for this act.In here she meets a group of misfits, women young mostly with whom she interacts and befriends. Apparently she did not have many young friends in school and is the only female in her class not going on to college. She wants to be a writer and I personally could associate with her trauma relating to the world and the way people chose to identify with this world. If you liked movies about troubled youth such as Gus Van Sant's [...] Good Will Hunting and Finding Forrester or Ron Howard's [...]) A Beautiful Mind, then you would certainly appreciate this masterpiece and the story is true.Yes, during the end credits I noticed that the movie is based on a novel by a person named Susanna. Then I looked at my VCD cover and saw ""Based on a True Story"" stamp on it. So now I am hunting for the novel version which seems more interesting than this movie, which I don't know whether that's possible. Anyways, this story is not about youth or a boring lecture on mental healthcare. It is about Susanna and her diagnosis and how she deals with it. She becomes good friends with a few of the characters in the mental ward and also with one nurse Valerie who is played well here by Whoopi Goldberg. The author Susanna criticised the movie though for fictional scenes added to the movie, but as a movie it is quite thrilling to watch as it is. But it has made me curious to hear the original tale as told by the author Susanna in her novel of the same name.All in all a refreshing movie and quite possibly the only one starring Angelina Jolie that I have liked. She won many awards for this role, all the top 3 - Academy, Screen and Golden Globe.I can't imagine any other actress than Winona Ryder in that role as Susanna and she really should have got more recognition than she did for this and other movies.Quote: ""Crazy isn't about being broken, or swallowing a dark secret.

First of all, the cast for this film is PERFECT, and every actress plays their parts well, especially Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, and Brittany Murphy. And this story has good intentions in trying to accentuate a message about teenage girls and their problems and turmoils (and insanity), but i didn't understand the concept of the main character being taken to a mental institution. Sure, she tried to kill herself (with aspirin overdose), and yeah she has ""borderline personality,"" but couldn't she get treated by getting therapy and taking meds to alleviate her problems? It seems as if she was forced in there because her parents lacked the skills to actually talk to their daughter and do other approaches before getting to the route they chose for her.I don't believe ""borderline personality"" alone qualifies that person to go to a mental institution. More than anything the girl was just depressed and had major issues. She wasn't nearly as crazy as the other patients in the institution, in fact for the most part she was the most SANE person in the whole place. It seems kind of strange that she became more crazy by being in the institution then she was out of it! That's the thing about this movie that left me ambiguous and confused. And another thing that kind of turned me off was how GI was a bit too similar to ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,"" i wish the director could have done a more original approach that didn't make it seem too predictable or familiar. But all in all, this film was well made, excellent cast, and is a great film that most teens should watch.

Susanna Kaysen's book is based on her two year stay at a psychiatric hospital.I first saw this movie on TBS.  Not knowing what I was watching, but familiar with the faces of the actors (Angelina Jolie, Winona Ryder, Whoopi Golberg, Brittney Murphy etc.) I decided to watch it.  Just from the entrance of the movie I was grabbed to see it.  It seemed very interesting and I wanted to know what would happen next.Girl, interrupted is the experiences Susanna Kaysen went through.  She was admitted into the hospital after a twenty minute appointment with a pshychiatrist.  In this movie she is torn because she is not sure if she belongs there.  One question that pops up a lot is if she is insane or sane.  She ends up making friends in the hospital.  Seeing the different girls, made a different world to her.  Girl, Interrupted is not just a drama but is written in a way which adds humor to the movie.  It is very interesting and has a value that makes you watch it over again.  As you know, well if you didn't know Angelina Jolie won four awards for her performance in this movie.  One award including an Oscar(best supporting actress).After seeing Girl, Interrupted I wanted the DVD.  I got the DVD and once I watched it, it was more interesting to me.  Of course on tv many scenes are cut out. After seeing the movie I bought the book.  This movie helps you realize certain things about life that you didn't before.GIrl, Interrupted I wouldn't say is a family movie, of course it is rated R. It is a movie you will some way be able to relate to.  It would be easy to say that this movie is a female version of One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest,  but it is more than that.  It has the truth of the outside world.  If you haven't yet, I recommend you pick up a copy of Girl, Interrupted and watch it.
