1223027,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001OQCUYI,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","If you took `Big', threw in a little `Disney's The Kid' and added an emotional heft of `It's a Wonderful Life' and you'd have the magic of '17 Again'.  I really can't believe I just said all that, since walking into this movie I expected to find it mundane and worthless.  I actually really liked this movie, like a lot.Sure, it's predictable, but in a charmingly fresh way.The film tells the story of Mike, a one-time basketball star who gave up his dreams to marry his pregnant girlfriend.  Twenty years later and Mike is bitter and dissatisfied with his life, which has weighed heavily on his wife Scarlett, who feels like the target of Mike's unhappiness.  The film opens with Mike living at his best friend Ned's house while he awaits his impending divorce.  Mike's teenage kids resent him and his wife is aching to love him, but her better judgment won't allow it.  When Mike gets a freaky visit from a man no one else can see he is soon in for a strange yet much needed wake up call.  After falling off a bridge, Mike finds himself 17 again, only this time he's living out his high school days in the present, with his wife and kids in arms reach.  Taking this as an opportunity to fix his life, Mike begins mending relationships, but his current situation certainly makes it a tad difficult.You don't need me to tell you that everything works out in the end, but the film works a lot of magic getting us there!Personally, I didn't have much faith in Zac Efron.  I was wrong.  This kid has loads of charm and real talent that he uses to full effect here.  The films more tender scenes are carried with the needed humor yet substantial emotional depth.  Who wasn't near tears while Efron unloads in a classroom about the love he felt for his newborn daughter or when he pleaded in the courtroom for his wife to give him another chance?  Efron NAILED this performance.  He was slick, charming, cool and emotionally relevant.  The supporting cast didn't do so bad either.  Thomas Lennon (as the nerdy best friend) is ridiculously hilarious here, even when his character is a little too far over the top, and Leslie Mann is not only beautiful, but she is intelligently funny (I just love her work).  Michelle Trachtenberg is like my new celebrity crush (man has she grown up) and Sterling Knight balances his awkwardness with layered bravado as Mike's son.Yes, this story has been told before, but that doesn't mean this one isn't just as good as the others.  It's far from what I expected, but that is a very good thing.",5,What can I say; it won me over!,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,2524,"['took', 'Big', 'threw', 'little', 'Disney', 'Kid', 'added', 'emotional', 'heft', 'Wonderful', 'Life', ""'d"", 'have', 'magic', ""'17"", 'Again', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'just', 'said', 'walking', 'movie', 'expected', 'find', 'mundane', 'worthless', 'actually', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot.Sure', 'predictable', 'charmingly', 'fresh', 'way.The', 'film', 'story', 'Mike', 'one-time', 'basketball', 'star', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'dreams', 'marry', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Mike', 'bitter', 'dissatisfied', 'life', 'weighed', 'heavily', 'wife', 'Scarlett', 'who', 'target', 'Mike', 'unhappiness', 'film', 'Mike', 'living', 'best', 'friend', 'Ned', 'house', 'impending', 'divorce', 'Mike', 'teenage', 'kids', 'resent', 'wife', 'aching', 'love', 'better', 'judgment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'When', 'Mike', 'freaky', 'visit', 'man', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'see', 'soon', 'strange', 'yet', 'much', 'needed', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'falling', 'off', 'bridge', 'Mike', '17', 'again', 'only', 'time', 'living', 'out', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'present', 'wife', 'kids', 'arms', 'reach', 'Taking', 'opportunity', 'fix', 'life', 'Mike', 'mending', 'relationships', 'current', 'situation', 'certainly', 'tad', 'difficult.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell', 'everything', 'out', 'end', 'film', 'lot', 'magic', 'getting', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'faith', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'was', 'wrong', 'kid', 'loads', 'charm', 'real', 'talent', 'full', 'effect', 'here', 'films', 'more', 'tender', 'scenes', 'are', 'carried', 'needed', 'humor', 'yet', 'substantial', 'emotional', 'depth', 'Who', 'was', ""n't"", 'near', 'tears', 'Efron', 'unloads', 'classroom', 'love', 'felt', 'newborn', 'daughter', 'when', 'pleaded', 'courtroom', 'wife', 'give', 'chance', 'Efron', 'NAILED', 'performance', 'was', 'slick', 'charming', 'cool', 'emotionally', 'relevant', 'supporting', 'cast', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'bad', 'Thomas', 'Lennon', 'nerdy', 'best', 'friend', 'ridiculously', 'hilarious', 'here', 'even', 'when', 'character', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'top', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'not', 'only', 'beautiful', 'intelligently', 'funny', 'just', 'love', 'work', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'new', 'celebrity', 'crush', 'man', 'grown', 'up', 'Sterling', 'Knight', 'awkwardness', 'layered', 'bravado', 'Mike', 'son.Yes', 'story', 'been', 'told', ""n't"", 'mean', 'one', ""n't"", 'just', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'far', 'what', 'expected', 'very', 'good', 'thing']",N/A

Zac Efron is a hunk and a doll, and I think he was awesome as a 40-year old man trapped in his own 17-year old body. He was believable, and his comedic timing was perfect. I was really worried that this flashback adventure would be predictable and only mildly funny, but it was pleasantly surprising and full of good humor. Leslie Mann and Matthew Perry are two of my favorite actors so it was nice to see them starring as the romantic leads, but it stinks that Perry didn't get as much screen time as Mann. I hope to see Perry in more movies soon...I miss his comic stylings.I also want to mention that the side love story of Ned and the principal cracked me up...their nerdiness brought them together.

1223031,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001OQCUYI,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","17 Again is probably the best family film you can possibly ask for.  The swear words are usually mild so kids, teens and adults can enjoy it as a family.I was laughing several times throughout the movie.  Of course the storyline is completely fictional because it's impossible for one person to actually turn back time and be 17 years old all over again, but for storyline reasons, it's a good one.The storyline flows flawlessly, so there's never any confusion over what's going on.The story is about a married man on the verge of a divorce who reflects back to his teenage years and when he was a star player on his high school basketball team.He believes he regrets getting his high school sweetheart pregnant, and believes he should have aimed for that basketball scholarship instead.While he reflects back to his teenage years, an old man appears (dressed as a janitor, but secretly holds the key to the fountain of youth).  Eventually the man actually transforms back to his teenage years, and this is when the story picks up BIG time.As a 17-year old teenager, he actually goes back to high school where he sees his son being picked on by bullies, and his daughter having creepy losers for boyfriends.  When he steps in and tries to defend his son and daughter against the bullies and losers, well, his son and daughter don't realize their classmate is actually their father, and that's what makes the film so hilarious.An even bigger part of the storyline is how he tries hitting on his wife as a 17-year old teen.  The wife of course, thinks there's a startling resemblance between the teen and her ex-husband, but for most of the film, she doesn't think there's anything more to it than just that- an amazing coincidence.Anyway, I laughed several times while watching this movie, and I recommend it to just about anybody who enjoys solid comedy and great storytelling.",5,fun family film,1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,1877,"['17', 'Again', 'probably', 'best', 'family', 'film', 'can', 'possibly', 'ask', 'swear', 'words', 'are', 'usually', 'mild', 'so', 'kids', 'teens', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'family.I', 'was', 'laughing', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'course', 'storyline', 'completely', 'fictional', 'impossible', 'one', 'person', 'actually', 'turn', 'back', 'time', 'be', '17', 'years', 'old', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'storyline', 'reasons', 'good', 'one.The', 'storyline', 'flawlessly', 'never', 'confusion', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'story', 'married', 'man', 'verge', 'divorce', 'who', 'back', 'teenage', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'star', 'player', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'team.He', 'getting', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'pregnant', 'should', 'have', 'aimed', 'basketball', 'scholarship', 'back', 'teenage', 'years', 'old', 'man', 'dressed', 'janitor', 'secretly', 'key', 'fountain', 'youth', 'Eventually', 'man', 'actually', 'back', 'teenage', 'years', 'when', 'story', 'up', 'BIG', '17-year', 'old', 'teenager', 'actually', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'son', 'being', 'picked', 'bullies', 'daughter', 'having', 'creepy', 'losers', 'boyfriends', 'When', 'tries', 'defend', 'son', 'daughter', 'bullies', 'losers', 'well', 'son', 'daughter', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'classmate', 'actually', 'father', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'hilarious.An', 'even', 'bigger', 'part', 'storyline', 'how', 'hitting', 'wife', '17-year', 'old', 'teen', 'wife', 'course', 'startling', 'resemblance', 'teen', 'ex-husband', 'most', 'film', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'more', 'just', 'that-', 'amazing', 'coincidence.Anyway', 'laughed', 'several', 'times', 'watching', 'movie', 'recommend', 'just', 'anybody', 'who', 'solid', 'comedy', 'great', 'storytelling']",N/A

1223040,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001OQCUYI,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 2]","On the surface, Mike O'Donnell is a lot like Troy Bolton, another Zac Efron character. Both play high school Basketball, and both are torn over two passions in their lives. Unlike Troy Bolton, however, Mike O'Donnell struggles with issues much deeper and more resonant than a choice between Basketball and musical theater; through divine intervention, he faces a choice between reliving his life and continuing down the path he has been on for twenty years. Mike is the main character of ""17 Again,"" a lighthearted but surprisingly good film that examines life's issues with a mixture of humor and warmth. Part of the charm comes from the nave and idealistic nature of the story--virtually nothing that happens is remotely possible, but we're engaged just the same, and that's because most people wish they had the chance to do something over again.Back in 1989, when Mike was still a seventeen-year-old high school student, he walked away from a Basketball scholarship to be with his girlfriend, Scarlett (Allison Miller). Today, Mike is a thirty-seven-year-old loser (Matthew Perry). He has emotionally checked out of his marriage. Scarlett (Leslie Mann) wants a divorce, and his teenage children, Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Alex (Sterling Knight), want nothing to do with him. He loses a promotion to an inexperienced girl no older than twenty-five. He has been kicked out of the house, forcing him to stay with his nerdy best friend, a rich software designer named Ned (Thomas Lennon), who Mike protected from bullies back in high school. Depressed and rejected, Mike is reduced to wandering the halls of his former high school and staring into a display case at his old picture.Along comes a pleasant-sounding janitor (Brian Doyle-Murray), who conveniently disappears whenever anyone else shows up. If given the chance, he asks Mike, would he want to relive his seventeenth year and make different decisions? Mike says he would. Not long after, Mike drives across a bridge in a freak rainstorm and sees the janitor jump over the railing. Mike rushes to the edge, sees a bizarre whirlpool of light at the bottom, and falls in.After returning to Ned's place the next morning, Mike is shocked to discover that he has been transformed into his seventeen-year-old self. Ned, quite familiar with fantasy archetypes, suggests that Mike has been changed in order to go on the proverbial hero's journey. Thinking this means another chance at a future in Basketball, Mike decides to pose as Ned's teenage son and go back to high school.Adopting the alias Marc, he quickly befriends his own son and mentors him in the ways of Basketball. Alex has talent, but he suffers from a serious lack of confidence. This is mostly because of the team captain, a juvenile delinquent named Stan (Hunter Parish), who bullies Alex just because he has nothing better to do. Unfortunately, Stan is also Maggie's boyfriend, which means that Mike now has to be her mentor as well as Alex's. Ultimately, Mike's relies on his years of experience as a way to encourage his children, to inspire them to be more than they are.Things take a complicated turn when he reunites with Scarlett and falls back in love with her. She, too, has feelings for him, especially since she can see the resemblance to her soon-to-be ex-husband. But a relationship is absolutely out of the question, and both of them know it; not only would it would be grossly inappropriate, it would also ruin Mike's new found sense of purpose.And herein lies the theme of ""17 Again"": What if being transformed into a teenager had nothing to do with pursuing a Basketball scholarship? What if the journey is just as much a learning experience as it is an inspiring one? Mike is essentially getting to know his wife and children for the first time, and as such, he's finally beginning to realize just how great they are. In turn, he's learning more about himself and his ability to be a good father figure. But what good will it do if he's trapped in the body of a seventeen-year-old? Despite the fact that this movie is basically a good-natured fable made with the intention of making us laugh, there are moments when the more mature subtexts rise to the surface and give the audience more to think about. But make no mistake--this movie is, above all else, a family-friendly comedy. One of the most entertaining subplots involves Ned's attempts to woo the school Principal (Melora Hardin). You might think this would be impossible, given his affinity for all things science fiction and fantasy (he can speak Elfish fluently). But don't be so hasty; even the most hardboiled among us can have surprisingly similar interests.I also enjoyed the juxtaposition of Mike's youthful appearance and his years of experience. Example: During the lunch period, Mike is able to one-up Stan, not by getting into a fight, but by proposing three different theories on why bullies behave the way they do, all while doing tricks with a basketball. And then there's an interesting scene in a sex ed class, where Mike preaches to Maggie and everyone else the importance of abstinence (in all likelihood, this was not a message the film was trying to send, but rather an instance of fatherly overprotection). Moments such as these made for a surprisingly entertaining film, one that presents itself as nothing more than an ordinary family comedy. Indeed, ""17 Again"" will appeal to younger audiences, especially if they're familiar with Efron's work in the ""High School Musical"" films. But because it explores family issues maturely, I think it's safe to say that older audiences will also get something out of it.",4,I Feel Young Again!,1240272000,"04 21, 2009",2009,5638,"['surface',

Maybe even if you haven't.10 Lessons I Learned From 17 Again1. Scriptwriters seemed to have run out of ideas, so eighties movie plots are being recycled.  I noticed this watching the trailers, too.  People my age are in need of being taught life lessons that we didn't learn the first time around, so we're going back to the future.  (Note to future directors: Stop.  Stop already, please.  Or if you do so, use lots of irony. Just a suggestion.  ""Back to the Future"" had a lot of in jokes, but ""17 Again"" squanders many chances to be funny.)2. If you were alive in the eighties, you'll recognize quite a few recycled scenes including ones from ""Back to the Future,"" ""Just One of the Guys,"" and the original ""17 Again.""  Presumably the switch in age was so there could be a college application storyline.  However, if you do the math, they've done some time fudging here.  That's the second thing you'll notice.  The first is the seeming miracle of Zac Efron turning into Matthew Perry.3.Taking responsibility for one's actions as a teen will make you extremely miserable in the future.  The best thing to do is put yourself and your needs first.4. When you're in high school, everything seems like the end of the world.  But you're really just beginning your life.  Actually, I learned this one already, but it's a good message anyway.5. Hitting on your friend's mom is no longer considered cool, at least in the Disneyverse.6. You need to keep exercising and eating right after high school, or you'll lose your youthful physique and no longer be as attractive to the opposite sex.7. If you go back to high school, it helps to have perfectly coiffed adorably floppy hair, nice cheekbones and unlimited access to your dad's credit card.8. There are at least two other options to two teens having a child of their own, but this film acts like they don't exist.9. Elvish can bring two unlikely souls together, one of whom keeps swearing that she'll never date the other.10. Beware of elderly janitors who seem to know everything about you.

1223059,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001OQCUYI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","It's 1989, and for 17-year-old high school star Mike O'Donnell the future looks brilliant. High school as his personal Camelot and flaunting exceptional skills at hoops, Mike is about to put on a show on the basketball court, for his fans and for that all-important college scout on the bench. But here's his gorgeous girlfriend and she's just given him a shocking reality check. And, just like that, there go the fame and fortune, Mike's future now narrowed down to one simple choice. Mike chooses to do the right thing, marries his girl who is expecting.It's 2009 now and we find Mike O'Donnell a discontented, out-of-shape loser of a family man. Two decades he's been married to his high school sweetheart, and the fallout to this are crippling regrets and a perception of potential having been wasted. That is how Mike sees it. Now his wife Scarlett is about to divorce him, and he's woefully out of touch with his two teenaged kids. The final straw comes when his 16 years of service at the firm is rewarded by his being skipped over for a big promotion (the extra scoop of shame comes in losing that promotion to a girl who was hired only two months ago).But Mike is about to get a do-over. In one of those messed-up, unconvincing plot devices, Mike plummets into the river and magically sheds twenty years. Seventeen again, Mike has this idea of rebooting his life or maybe fixing his life. He enrolls in his old high school, now being attended by his two troubled, disaffected children. But Mike is unprepared for how drastically high school life has changed. Once the coolest dude in the classroom, Mike O'Donnell finds himself languishing outside the popular loop.I caught 17 AGAIN last night on cable TV. I wasn't jonesing to see this flick when it was out in the theater, mostly because I've seen variations of this fantasy premise before, and seen it done well in movies likeBig (Extended Edition), both versions of FREAKY FRIDAY (Freaky Friday 2-pack (1977 & 2003 Versions)), and even inVice Versa. But, it turns out, 17 AGAIN is a well-constructed family flick, surprisingly watchable and able to bring a freshness to this old tale. Zac Efron steps away from being a featured song & dance puppet in the HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL franchise. Not that he gets edgy or street gritty all of a sudden, but it's nice to see the kid get off the Disney factory treadmill. Efron is still a teen idol and 17 AGAIN is still very much in that girl heartthrob wheelhouse, but at least it's a bit different and this time he gets a chance to play with established grown-up actors. Having said that, in the opening scene, Efron treats the movie audience to an ""All the girls drool now"" moment as he goes thru a shirtless workout in the school gym. Zac Efron definitely has got charm and he's even credible when demonstrating the unhip sensibilities of a dad on the pessimistic side of 30. And, in those scenes calling for emotional depth, he shows surprising range; he even sounds sincere as he dispenses parental advice to his ""peers."" Maybe the kid's got the chops to last.Matthew Perry happens to be a favorite of mine, and it's a shame that his film career hasn't taken off, post-FRIENDS. He's not in this movie much; he plays the adult Mike O'Donnell . But he manages to do that thing he does, which is play characters who are sarcastically witty but uncomfortable in their own skins. The wonderful, lovely Leslie Mann shows up, and she's predictably wonderful and lovely. Thomas Lennon, as Mike's peculiar best friend, lends the film an influx of nerd oddity. And for Michelle Trachtenberg, it's nice to see that there's life after BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.It's not that startling that the narrative beats are contrived. Much of the humor is predictable, making that extra layer of quirk that much more welcome. As mentioned, the quirky element comes in the shape of Mike's best pal who happens to be one of those differently-wired cats and who should just never be let out in public because he is that socially inept. It's twisty fun, though, keeping up with his courtship (or - let's not talk falsely now - stalking) of the icy but kinda hot high school principal. Lest all nerds lose hope, realize that even the most aloof of goddesses may wave a freak flag. So cue the seductive dinner conversation, but in Elvish. Later, the sexy principal coyly extends an offer: ""You can plunder my dungeon anytime."" Mike's weird friend responds with: ""I'll bring my longbow."" Oh, unholy nerdgasm. The film also flirts with a case of the icky but, thankfully, doesn't follow thru. You'll see what I'm talking about.And as if we weren't already aware, the movie comments on the pervasiveness of today's communication devices. No sooner is Mike pummeled by a school bully than the beating is posted on YouTube and shared thru everyone's cellies.It's a bit huh? that the high school coach, who was Mike's coach 20 years past, doesn't ever mark the eerie similarities between Mike now and Mike ago. But, despite that and all the cliches and despite the lame inclusion of the janitorial guardian angel, 17 AGAIN supplies enough grace notes to resonate with just about everyone, but especially with us middle-agers drowning in nostalgia. Ah, wedgies, doing someone else's homework, and relinquishing one's lunch money... who knew my stroll down memory lane would be so rosy? Excuse me, please, while I go cry into a big pillow.",4,"""I bet you wish you had it to do all over again,"" remarks the deus ex machina of a janitor",1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,5409,"['1989',

He's now middle-aged and is suddenly restored to his 17-year-old body (keeping his middle-aged mind) and goes back to his high school.  This enables him to apply his life experience to do some things differently and set some things right.  In the process, he gains a new appreciation for his wife and kids and the importance of his role as a husband and father.  He also comes to realize that he's been foolishly acting like a victim all those years after high school, instead of taking responsibility for his decisions and his life.  Having learned these things, he's restored back to middle age and vows not to waste the rest of his life.That's pretty much it for the general plot and the lessons of the movie.

1223065,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B001OQCUYI,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[5, 7]","Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron and Matthew Perry) was a star basketball player in high school destined to get a scholarship for college. But when he misses a big game when he runs off with his girlfriend, Scarlett (Leslie Mann and Allison Miller), he misses his chance for college stardom. Fast forward several years later, Mike's on the verge of divorce, is all but hated by his two kids, Alex (Sterling Knight) and Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg), and is dreaming of the days in high school when he could have made more of his life. But one day, when going to pick up his kids from high school, he runs into a janitor who seemingly grants his wish to go back to high school and relive his high school dreams.Let's face it, the premise of someone switching bodies, transforming into an older person, and vice versa has become a tired premise. There's been 13 Going On 30, Freaky Friday (which has been done twice), 18 Again!, and of course the best of the lot Big with Tom Hanks. Naturally, when this came out I don't think many people expected anything earth shatteringly original, but, instead, all eyes were on Zac Efron. Could Efron carry a movie that was beyond the Disney tween audience? Can he actually act outside of the High School Musical movies that made him a star?The answer, while not resounding, is a definitive yes. We'll have to wait for something else to come along to see if he can be a grown up actor, but he does equip himself well in this movie. While you see Efron play the part at the beginning of the movie, Matthew Perry picks up the part fairly early and carries the part for a little bit. When Efron picks the part back up after a little bit, he does a very good job of mimicking some of Perry's mannerisms, allowing you to get lost in the idea that these two actors are really the same character. The one performance that really stood out in my mind, the actor who really stole every scene he was in, was really Thomas Lennon as Mike's high school friend/ nerd Ned Gold. Thomas Lennon plays the perfect eccentric, just far enough over the top, but not too far playing the character wryly rather than just as a clown.As far as the rest of the movie goes, 17 Again gets extra credit for making fun of it's premise. After a Star Wars spoofing fight, when Ned realizes that Mike has come back as his 17 year old counterpart, he says, ""It's a classic transformation story. Are you now or have you ever been a Norse God, Vampire, or Time Traveling Cyborg?"" But of course, while it may have some interesting moments, for the most part 17 Again deals with the same tired concept, and the same tired messages as every other body transformation movie. This is a sub genre that feels almost as if you've seen one, you've seen them all.All in all, I'd actually have to say that this movie might have just enough new, and the performances are good enough that this might just be worth your time.

I'm 26 years out of high school and while I don't look 17, I still look like my younger self.Maybe David Cassidy should have been chosen for the older role, but then they would have had to go for a much older 'older role' which would have made the wife/kid attraction seriously creepy.2) The mom hardly EVER interacted with her kids.

He's sweet but takes no prisoners when dealing with ruffians, and his moves on the dance floor and his agility with a basketball are equally impressive.  He demonstrates his acting chops in this movie as well, going from winsome to tough to romantic and all-around likeable without ruffling a feather.Thomas Lennon as his quirky Star Wars sidekick is hilarious and adorable.  His role is more than a supporting one, as his storyline is given more space than one might expect, but it adds a lot to the movie's humor and keeps it lighter than it would be with the sometimes gritty problems that Mike faces with his children's issues and the difficulties of trying to recapture his wife's love.Matthew Perry's part is too small to do him justice, but he fulfills it well.  The movie focuses mainly on Zac Efron's part in regaining what the adult Mike, played by Perry, cannot get back on his own.This movie is so enjoyable that you're willing to suspend disbelief when you need to.  Mike's wife, for example, seeing him exactly as he looked when he was a teenager, is very slow in picking up on the fact that he IS her husband as a teenager, and she seems blandly accepting of the story concocted by Lennon's character that the young Mike is his son.  Of course, the transformation from 30-year-old to 17-year-old Mike is another leap, but the movie is so engaging that you don't mind.  Watching Mike get back at the bullies picking on his teen children is satisfying, and his efforts to extricate himself from sticky situations are humorous.Anyone who ever thinks about those teen years and wishes there were a way to go back and relive them again will enjoy this movie.  There's plenty of action, some tender moments, and enough craziness to keep you thoroughly entertained.

1223099,A6EPTBZ75YMKW,B001OQCUYI,Olivia Joy,"[16, 22]","There seems like so much I could say about this movie.  My initial thoughts are:-Too adult in nature for Zac Efron's kid fans-Has good themes and messages-Most of the funny parts are in the previews17 Again is one of those half and half films--half of it is good, moral, and entertaining, and half of it is raunchy, mature in nature, and unnecessary.  The plot goes something like this: Middle-aged Mike is unhappy with his life and about to get a divorce from his wife.  He and his kids are like strangers to each other, even though he genuinely cares for them.  One night Mike mysteriously transports to the age of 17 in present times.  He decides (with the help of his MAJOR sci-fi freak best friend) to go back to high school and help put his kids on the right path.  So Mike (under the name of Mark) goes back to school and spends his time lecturing his kids about who they should date, helping them onto sports teams, or romancing their mom (who is also his wife).Some of the funniest parts are the most awkward ones.  Teenage Mike/Mark dancing with his wife (to his wife, he is just her son's friend) and being found by their son.  Mike/Mark's daughter wants to start a relationship with the teenage Mike/Mark, not knowing that he is actually her dad.  When he tells her that they can never be together, she at first thinks that he is gay.  There is one use of the b-word and some other mild profanities.  Mike/Mark's daughter has a pompous, lustful boyfriend.  Mike's best friend is seen in bed (fully clothed) with the school principal (at the end of the film, right before the credits).I was surprised at the amount of good messages in this movie.  Mike (when he is actually 17 in high school sometime in the 1980's) gives up his college dreams to marry his pregnant girlfriend.  When he is an adult, he strives to spend time with his kids and shows genuine interest in their lives.  When he goes back to the age of 17 through the warp thing, he makes it his goal to help his kids get their lives on the right track.  He speaks about abstinence to the entire Health class.

All of a sudden, in some mysterious magical way, Mike is tranformed into a teenager and he goes back to high school to relive his glory days as a basketball star.  The adult Mike is played by Matthew Perry and the young ""17 Again"" Mike is played by Zac Efron.The ActingThis movie is obviously meant as a showcase for Zac Efron.  He demonstrates his incredible basketball skills, as well as his fine acting talent in this comedy. There are numerous comedic situations involving young Mike, including scenes with his son.  For example, in a reversal of roles, the son corrects the father, especially when young Mike ogles his older wife.  Too much looking and young Mike gets a rap in the head with a basketball or gets squirted with water from his son.Leslie Mann plays the wife and mom, and she does it with a delicate balance.  Mom, (Ms. O' Donnell), is gracious and usually keeps just enough distance from young Mike to make it believable.  Ms. Mann's acting is nuanced and her character is soft, gentle, and slightly off balanced, but in a sweet and ditzy way.The SmackdownSmack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Count them. That's a total of eight smacks.  I was cracking up when young Mike was smacked in the face by his wife, his daughter, three beautiful teenage girls, and by his nerdy, best friend.

There is an especially touching scene in a courthouse in which Zac has to show his vulnerability, and he does this extremely well. Overall, very enjoyable and watchable. If you are a Zac Efron fan, you'll love it. If you aren't a fan, you'll become one after watching this film. I know the critics were not overly enthusiastic about this movie, but I think male heterosexual critics have a hard time praising anything Zac Efron does. It may have something to do with his looks or his fan base of teenage girls; as if someone that teenage girls like couldn't possibly have any acting skills. The same critics loved Ryan Gosling in Drive, in which Mr. Gosling, although in general a very good actor, pretty much has one look the entire film. His acting style in this film consisted of him staring very intently and delivering his lines.

Now, in his 30s, Mike gets the unprecedented chance to start over when he finds himself inexplicably back in his 17-year-old body after plunging into a river.  He immediately re-enrolls in high school, the same one his children now attend, in an attempt to both reignite his truncated basketball career and keep an eye on his kids and help them overcome their various teen-related issues and problems.  And after years spent bemoaning the life of athletic glory he never got to experience, Mike learns that there's really nothing more important in life than being a good husband and father to one's family.Despite game performances from the two Mikes (Matthew Perry and Zac Efron), ""17 Again"" suffers from an ill-conceived premise, labored slapstick routines, and an overabundance of sappy life lessons to go along with all the standard teen-movie hijinks.  There may also be a few too many incest and underage-sex jokes for some people's comfort.

The fact that this release comes with not only the Blu-ray edition, but a standard definition DVD and a digital copy adds to its value that may push it from being just a rental to worth purchasing.I didn't look at the latter two, since the Blu-ray version was all that I was interested in. The picture quality is very good, without any artifacts or edge enhancement problems to be found. The Dolby TrueHD audio track is also surprisingly good. Many times, comedies aren't good movies for getting decent sound, but when the movie calls for it, the subwoofer and the surround channels get a chance to perform.The extras aren't bad, but unless you're in love with Zac Efron and/or you just have to see more of the movie, no matter what, they're largely forgettable. The BD-Live extras aren't all that much better, except for the fact that this is the first WB title I've seen to contain a ""My Commentary"" segment, which was recorded by Thomas Lennon, Zac Efron, and Melora Hardin. It's actually funny to watch them rip on each other and recount the movie as it's playing.The movie itself is a Zac Efron vehicle. It features him on the cover, it calls him out in the corner of the packaging (Packed with Zac!), and even the extras highlight the fact that the screenplay was rewritten specifically for Zac Efron to play the lead. We've seen this kind of movie before, and its themes have been covered much better by those that preceded it, so then it falls onto the performances of the cast to make it better than mediocre. While Efron doesn't do a bad job, his supporting cast saves the movie from mediocrity. Thomas Lennon elevates every scene he's in, and the chemistry between Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann is very good as well.For most people, this might be a rental, but if you're on the fence, the extras make it worth the purchase.

1223118,AP3B615GM191G,B001OQCUYI,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","Considering the fact that the premise of this film (old/young body/soul swapping) has pretty much been done to death in varying decades, ""17 Again"" is surprisingly effective at rendering the concept funny once again in 2009.For a basic plot summary, this film sees an adult Mike O'Donnell (Matthew Perry) dissatisfied with his life and pining for the promise of his high school career once again.  Well, thanks to a magical school janitor (one should always watch out for those characters!), he is put back into the body of his former teen self (Zac Efron) for a ""do-over"".  The ""catch"", however, is that he is still in the present day (2009), not 1989.The plot of this movie alone lends itself to all sorts of personal and social sight gags, and this movie mines them to their fullest.  Seeing Mike trying to weave his way through current high school hallways and scenarios is made entertaining by director Burr Steers.  It never gets boring, but also never goes ""over the top"", either.What really makes ""17 Again"" a fun watch, however, is the quality of the acting.  Though Perry is okay in his relatively brief role, Efron is solid as ""young Mike"" trying to find his place in today's world.  So many viewers can't stand Efron because they view him as a ""pretty boy"", but in this effort he shows he can act a bit, too.  Youngsters Sterling Knight & Michelle Trachtenberg shine in their roles as well.  Yet, Thomas Lennon (of Reno 911 fame) nearly steals the show as the goofy nerd sidekick, providing some of the funniest moments of the entire experience.Overall, ""17 Again"" is a charming little film that can be enjoyed by tweens on up.  A few of the jokes and physical humor is a bit ""risque"", but for the most part it is relatively tame (at least compared to other comedies of the same nature).",4,Suprisingly Good For Such An Overworked Premise,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,1799,"['Considering', 'fact', 'premise', 'film', 'old/young', 'body/soul', 'swapping', 'pretty', 'much', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'varying', 'decades', '17', 'Again', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'rendering', 'concept', 'funny', 'once', 'again', '2009.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'adult', 'Mike', ""O'Donnell"", 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'dissatisfied', 'life', 'pining', 'promise', 'high', 'school', 'career', 'once', 'again', 'Well', 'thanks', 'magical', 'school', 'janitor', 'one', 'should', 'always', 'watch', 'out', 'characters', 'put', 'back', 'body', 'former', 'teen', 'self', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'do-over', 'catch', 'however', 'still', 'present', 'day', '2009', 'not', '1989.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'alone', 'sorts', 'personal', 'social', 'sight', 'gags', 'movie', 'fullest', 'Seeing', 'Mike', 'trying', 'weave', 'way', 'current', 'high', 'school', 'hallways', 'scenarios', 'made', 'entertaining', 'director', 'Burr', 'Steers', 'never', 'boring', 'also', 'never', 'top', 'either.What', 'really', '17', 'Again', 'fun', 'watch', 'however', 'quality', 'acting', 'Perry', 'okay', 'relatively', 'brief', 'role', 'Efron', 'solid', 'young', 'Mike', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'today', 'world', 'So', 'many', 'viewers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Efron', 'view', 'pretty', 'boy', 'effort', 'can', 'act', 'bit', 'too', 'Youngsters', 'Sterling', 'Knight', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'shine', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'Thomas', 'Lennon', 'Reno', '911', 'fame', 'nearly', 'show', 'goofy', 'nerd', 'sidekick', 'providing', 'funniest', 'moments', 'entire', 'experience.Overall', '17', 'Again', 'charming', 'little', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'tweens', 'few', 'jokes', 'physical', 'humor', 'bit', 'risque', 'most', 'part', 'relatively', 'tame', 'least', 'compared', 'other', 'comedies', 'same', 'nature']",N/A
