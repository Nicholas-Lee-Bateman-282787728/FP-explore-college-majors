780648,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B0000E2PVR,alex bushman,"[4, 7]","Not to denigrate one of the best comedies of network television, but this show illustrates that for as funny as Seinfeld was and still is, his shows success had as much to do with this funny man.  Larry David also one ups that show not merely because he has a longer leash to play with on cable, but because the time that he's alotted allows him to play with real human emotion.  On Seinfeld, it was about extremely selfish characters making each others lives miserable. Here, the underlying message is that even if you're rich from a highly successful TV series, life still isn't easy and the little things can really get to you when you get as big as Larry David.  It's just like the Notorius B.I.G.'s song ""Mo Money Mo Problems,"" although most of David's problems deal with how he relates to other people, other snobby people.  Almost the entire series (at least the first season, which is all that I'm reviewing)is devoted to demonstrating Murphy's Law of how anything that can go wrong will go wrong.  The only episode off the top of my head that didn't end with a negative was the one where his wife lost a bet and had to service him in the car.  Even then, you didn't see him get the satisfaction because the episode ended just as he was asking for his favor. All in all, it's a very funny show with plot points that you can see coming a mile away, but still don't prevent it from being hilarious and painful simultaneously.  You really feel sorry for this fictional depiction of a real man.  As for the extras, they are minimal, however, they tell the uninitiated just what they need to know about the origins of the series and other pertinent information.  I look forward to seeing the rest of the series eventually (on DVD, because I don't have cable).",5,Now this is a great show,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,1762,"['Not', 'denigrate', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'network', 'television', 'show', 'as', 'funny', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'still', 'shows', 'success', 'had', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'funny', 'man', 'Larry', 'David', 'also', 'one', 'ups', 'show', 'not', 'merely', 'longer', 'leash', 'play', 'cable', 'time', 'alotted', 'play', 'real', 'human', 'emotion', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'about', 'extremely', 'selfish', 'characters', 'making', 'others', 'miserable', 'Here', 'underlying', 'message', 'even', ""'re"", 'rich', 'highly', 'successful', 'TV', 'series', 'life', 'still', ""n't"", 'easy', 'little', 'things', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'when', 'get', 'as', 'big', 'Larry', 'David', 'just', 'Notorius', 'B.I.G', 'song', 'Mo', 'Money', 'Mo', 'Problems', 'most', 'David', 'problems', 'deal', 'how', 'other', 'people', 'other', 'snobby', 'people', 'Almost', 'entire', 'series', 'least', 'first', 'season', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'devoted', 'demonstrating', 'Murphy', 'Law', 'how', 'anything', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'will', 'go', 'wrong', 'only', 'episode', 'top', 'head', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'negative', 'was', 'one', 'where', 'wife', 'lost', 'bet', 'had', 'service', 'car', 'Even', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'get', 'satisfaction', 'episode', 'ended', 'just', 'was', 'asking', 'favor', 'very', 'funny', 'show', 'plot', 'points', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'being', 'hilarious', 'painful', 'simultaneously', 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'fictional', 'depiction', 'real', 'man', 'extras', 'are', 'minimal', 'however', 'tell', 'uninitiated', 'just', 'what', 'need', 'know', 'origins', 'series', 'other', 'pertinent', 'information', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'rest', 'series', 'eventually', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 1

They all had very funny moments - I could definitely feel the Seinfeld mind at work.  However, I felt that Larry David is really ""George"".  George lies a lot, gets into awkward situations because of those lies, and is generally not getting along so well because of the lies and awkward situations.  George is great to watch.  I love George.  But after watching these episodes, I realize that I need some Elaine, Kramer and Jerry to balance out George.  The show is too much Larry David getting into awkward, awful situations.  There were no happy endings - at best, there was an ending or two in which Larry didn't look like a complete loser.  While Seinfeld didn't bring us any warm, fuzzy endings, it at least brought its fair share of wrapping up - resolving the conflicts, good bye, see you next week.  Here, I wasn't getting any of that.  Too much George/Larry David!I share other readers' problems with the show - production, acting, etc., but those problems weren't as big to me as the overall story line just being too depressing/awkward.

It is on HBO, which allows it to be as bold as it has to be, but it also reduces the number of possible viewers. The other reason is the show is built like a house of cards, that invariably comes crashing down at the end. This is not a show that you can flip on ten minutes in.  Everything builds and builds until it explodes in a burst of comic delight.  The final reason why this show is not as well known is that it is very 'acidic'.  Larry and the cast do not pull any punches, and the situations Larry gets in are often uncomfortable, but well worth the time.  As each episode progresses the mostly improvisational dialogue becomes more refined and fluid, which means the show only gets better with time.About the DVD: The DVD is fine, it includes the &quot;HBO Special&quot; that inspired the series, however the audio commentary is sparse, and each episode is 1 chapter, so there is no skipping ahead in an episode, you just have to watch the whole thing.T",5,The BEST comedy on TV.,1083801600,"05 6, 2004",2004,1063,"['funniest', 'show', 'television', 'However', 'nature', 'few', 'people', 'know', 'HBO', 'be', 'as', 'bold', 'be', 'also', 'number', 'possible', 'viewers', 'other', 'reason', 'show', 'built', 'house', 'cards', 'invariably', 'crashing', 'down', 'end', 'not', 'show', 'can', 'flip', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Everything', 'builds', 'builds', 'burst', 'comic', 'delight', 'final', 'reason', 'why', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'very', ""'acidic"", 'Larry', 'cast', 'do', 'not', 'pull', 'punches', 'situations', 'Larry', 'are', 'often', 'uncomfortable', 'well', 'time', 'episode', 'mostly', 'improvisational', 'dialogue', 'more', 'refined', 'fluid', 'show', 'only', 'better', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'fine', 'quot', 'HBO', 'Special', 'quot', 'inspired', 'series', 'however', 'audio', 'commentary', 'sparse', 'episode', '1', 'chapter', 'skipping', 'ahead', 'episode', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing.T']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 1

The only thing that changes is the cameo's. Larry David is a horrible actor, writer, and producer. He took the popularity of Seinfelds' George Castanza and turned that character into a whole show on it's own. It's Seinfeld with profanity. This is what happens when a writer/producer/Actor runs out of ideas. It sickens me that HBO would give a moron like Larry David an enormous budget to do the same episode over and over. While a few years before they had been giving the comic gods Bob Odenkirk and David Cross a budget of practically nothing to do &quot;Mr.Show.&quot; This eventually lead to the death of Mr.Show.The only posotive thing I can say about this show is that it's not as bad as Jerry Seinfelds &quot;The Comedian.&quot; That was the biggest Vanity project of all time.

The HBO series has finally reached DVD, and is a must have for an lover of true comedic talent. The star/creator Larry David is an ex-writer for 'Seinfeld', but 'Curb...', with its absence of a laugh-track and utterly realistic concepts, admittedly takes it one step further than the successful 'Seinfeld'. Almost completely improvisational, the show focuses on Larry's life as an HBO-exec. Once the audience grasps Larry's attitude towards people, it will surely have a great time watching him deal with the consequences of his abrupt behavior. Despite his sarcasm (he detests opinion, unless it's his own) and the constant repelling of offended individuals, Larry's wife (Cheryl Hines) and friend (Jeff Garlin) manage to communicate with him, and it's those relationhips that orm the heart of the show. Larry wins sympathy, and then comes up with spontaneous outbursts of unreasonable behavior.Hilarious, 'Curb...' is an essential addition to any comedy-lover's DVD collection.

Well, Larry David, creator of the Greatest Sitcom of All Time, plays himself in a Los Angeles version of Seinfeld with R-rated language and situations. Partners in crime include Larry's agent and best friend, Jeff Greene, and comedian-friend Richard Lewis. Other celeb's, such as Ted Danson, make an appearance. With every episode, Larry runs afoul of almost everyone he encounters, not to mention his wife, Cheryl, and Jeff's shrewish wife, Susie. In Season 1, almost all of the shows are great. Included are many classic moments, among the best might be the disastrous ""porn dinner party,"" where Larry is forced to do an embarrassing ""double goodbye."" None of the shows, however, are weak. Having watched Curb repeatedly, and when factoring in Larry's seven seasons on Seinfeld, I now subscribe to the Tao of Larry. What is it, you ask? Perhaps it's that people are functionally insane; that no good deed goes unpunished (or bad deed for that matter); and that we are creatures of passion and habit, not our environment. Some might find Larry the world's most obnoxious man. Others (and I'm one) might find him the funniest. If there is a ""Seinfeld Curse"" it certainly does not apply to Larry.

Truly a behind-the-scenes personality on the show, and unquestionably the source of its genius, David strikes out on his own with ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" which, believe it or not, is even funnier than ""Seinfeld.""I bought the two-disc DVD set and recommend it highly. It contains the first season's worth of episodes, and each one is a gem -- a bitterly satiric, bitingly hilarious masterpiece in which David is constantly getting himself into trouble (usually when he's just ""trying to be affable!""). David is wonderful playing himself, though for some people, a little of this self-involved curmudgeon can go an awfully long way. He is greatness.I also love the supporting cast, including Jeff Garlin as David's manager and the adorable Cheryl Hines as his (fictitious) wife. Richard Lewis also makes the occasional amusing cameo (though a little of him can last a lifetime).For ""Seinfeld"" fans, this show is a revelation, a reminder of the kick the old show once provided (and still does, I guess, in reruns). ""Curb"" is highly reminiscent of ""Seinfeld"" (the slightest faux pax can result in unintended catastrophe), but David takes his largely improvised plots to new extremes of anxiety, awkwardness and self-loathing.I love all the episodes on the DVD, but ""Porno Gil,"" ""Beloved Aunt,"" ""Affirmative Action"" and ""The Wire"" are the best.

In this case, Larry himself is the central character, with the two main supporting characters Jeff Garlin (as Jeff Greene, Larry's agent), and Cheryl Hines (as Cheryl David, Larry's wife).  There are certainly similarities between ""Seinfeld"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"".  Jerry Seinfeld played himself in the first series, while Larry David plays himself in this series.  Also, both shows tend to be about the minutia of life, and that is where they get their humor.There are differences as well; ""Seinfeld"" was more of an ensemble show, while this show has a single character focus.  ""Seinfeld"" was also a network program, while ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is from HBO, and so there are virtually no restrictions as there were with the prior series.  ""Seinfeld"" was scripted, while in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" the dialogue is improvised.There are only ten episodes in this season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", and yet despite this several of the episodes seem to follow a formula.  In this formula, Larry gets into an argument with a character early in the episode, only to have it come back and cause a problem for him later on.  They are still very funny to watch, but it does take away a bit from the overall enjoyment.  My favorite episodes from this season would be ""The Bracelet"", ""Beloved Aunt"", and ""The Group"".There are a few additional features in this two disk DVD set.  On Disk 1, there is an audio commentary with Larry David, Jeff Garlin, Cheryl Hines, and the director Robert B. Weide for the first episode.  Disk 2 has the original 1 hour HBO special from which the show came, and there is a 30 minute interview of Larry David by Bob Costas.  If you like Seinfeld, then you will probably enjoy this series as well, although you should be aware that there are differences.

Also, during the course of each show, there is one or two very weird (yet very funny) characters that somehow tie into the rest of the show.

Enter Larry David and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm.&quot;  David so often tries to do the right thing, or to stand up for what is pragmatically, albeit trivially, just, only to have everything backfire. While &quot;Lucy&quot; was advanced in so many ways, it was still grounded in the 50s, but with an edge that made it unique and assured its long life in reruns.  &quot;Curb&quot; is set squarely in this century, has show biz swirling in and out of the plots, and involves a character who can be lovable, creative, selfish, observant and prone to disaster all in the same episode. I feel it has a long life ahead of it, also. I admit, it took me a few episodes to &quot;get it&quot; and to become a hard-core fan.  The DVD of the first season is an excellent package. In fact, I now want all the seasons to come out by next month or I'll be disappointed!  Though I've seen all but two of these episodes on HBO, rewatching them---again with the comparison---reminds me of how I used to watch Lucy: repeated viewings of, for example, the candy factory episode, or the wine stomping episode, never got old.  The laughs kept coming.  With &quot;Curb,&quot; I've watched the doll head episode, the baptism episode and the manger episode several times each and still laugh my ass off. When they come out on DVD, the laughter will continue.

I really liked it, so I watched the entire Seinfeld show.  Then noticing some guy named Larry David was constantly listed in the credits, I decided to check out Curb Your Enthusiasm.  I like CYE more than Seinfeld.  When you watch CYE, you realise that George Costanza is Larry David, and you realise how much of Seinfeld was really Larry David.  After Larry left Seinfeld, the writing declined sharply, and got quite silly at times.  I think this show is hilarious, especially the first episode when Larry insults Richard Lewis's girlfriend.  I also love the ""Wagner"" episode (Trick or Treat), and when Richard and Larry help the blind guy move in.  Susie Essman's character in this show is absolutely hysterical.  Just imagine an even more shrill and ticked off version of Janeane Garofalo, and you get the idea.

780685,AEGLLY9CXWXX3,B0000E2PVR,"Halifax Student Account ""a-beautiful-idea""","[1, 2]","Genius comedy is rare, with the rubbish coming out the anus of mass culture and all that, but thankfully, Curb Your Enthusiasm ranks with the brightest and the best telly can offer. Larry David is an absolute genius, like Ricky Gervais and Woody Allen, but funnier and cleverer at the same time. I love his writing and rank Curb with The Office and Cheers as one of funniest shows ever. My girlfriend however noticed a very funny thing about the casting that most people, including me, missed. When she told me, it made me smile (for once). She reckons that Larry David has basically cast himself as David Duchovny's Hank Moody character from Californication, and not just cast, but David is passing himself off as Hanks twin brother! Even stranger is that nobody has spotted the age issue. I would first like to list a few examples of the similarity of both shows, and then I will laugh at Larry David.Here are two examples, from off the top of my head. Both shows are set in Hollywood and star successful writers who are living off their past productions; we can say that they are semi-retired. Both Larry David and Hank Moody are fish out of water types, like Crocodile Dundee, thus they can see things others can't. Also, the best friend of Larry David and Hank Moody is his agent, who has a plush office and who wants to get off with his secretary, etc. Both characters roam around the Hollywood rich set, with not much to do; this backdrop supplies the social commentary for the thrust of both shows.In Californication, David Duchovny is harassed by teenage girls, who force him to have sex and take drugs; cue hilarious story-lines in Californication.In Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David's character is constantly harassed and bothered by poor people, that is, Hollywood's zero's who work in shopping malls and restaurants, and who dare to appear in front of Larry David's face; grrr!! Cue hilarious adventures.So when David Duchovny's coolness forced his ego to get off with beautiful teenagers and sneer in a cool manner, Larry David's character is forced to sneer in an aloof but funny manner. And it goes deeper that that (see below).So we see Larry David arguing with a waiter over why he should pay a tip, this would be funny if it wasn't for Larry David's own admission that he is indeed a millionaire, and so the joke didn't hurt my sides as advertised (Larry David must really fancy himself as a persecuted victim of those horrid Murlocks from H.G. Wells: The Time Machine, as he actually wrote this scene). Funnier still, Larry David hilariously shouts down aggressive female nurses who display annoying behaviour, like attending sick cues (those annoying sick people!) and he gets the once in a lifetime opportunity to humiliate a ridiculous shoe salesman (you have to see it for yourself).  Larry David's must be completely out of touch if he believes that laughing at workers is a source of insight. What's his next trick, bringing back sterilisation for the poor?I am not defending poor people, because, well I suppose that if the main character is a handsome sort of sex symbol, like Hank Moody, then we have an American Psycho on our hands and this would be a character out of a Dostoevsky novel and would be very watchable. In Californication, Hank Moody is close to the above, but he was too busy getting raped by teenage girls and so the writers of Californication missed out on a classic dark comedy. In Curb, Larry David does indeed sneer at the poor and the huddled masses, unfortunately, Larry David is not Hank Moody. Larry is an old man, sorry!Larry David, you see, plays is as an angst ridden young man playing a much younger man with equally intense sarcasm and vanity. A big problem I found with Larry David's angst ridden dark star of fate persona, is when he does his looking away and sneering aloof at the absurdity of people and life situations etc, he just looks like a grumpy old man. This spoilt the effect for me as I do not think that Larry David had this in mind when he wrote the script. Now if David Duchovny played Larry's role, things would be different. If you haven't seen Californication, well trust me, Duchovny was brilliant in it, and Curb Your Enthusiasm is so similar, that Larry David should have cast the younger David in his shoes. With Duchovny in Larry's shoes, we can easily imagine a classic dark masterpiece. Duchovny's hero is a sneeringly repressed Hollywood writer, who sees himself as a crucified Heideggerian God; he disparagingly condemns the mind-set of the self regarding moneyed comrades he is forced to toil with, on a day to day basis, and he especially wags his finger at the local poor loser class. This is not as dramatic a description as it appears, because Larry David obviously fancies himself as the `above-all-this' man. With Duchovny starring, Curb Your Enthusiasm would be even funnier that American Psycho!You see, I'm all for rugged anti hero's, because the genre allows the bad ass hero a few decades in their self perpetuating mischief of angriness to grow and redeem (so Duchovny's Hank Moody is allowed to sleep and drug schoolgirls because we are safe in the knowledge that he will eventual learn and grow); this is why the anti hero genre works, because it taps into our unconscious expectation of allowing the anti-hero time to become a better person. However, when the hero is pushing 70, well it doesn't work on a human level because we except inner growth to have hit the spot by then and thus wisdom to have flowered; we do not expect the successful man, approaching the great beyond, to act like an existential teenager.Now then, all this intellectual flagellation is unconscious remember, so I still laughed along with everybody else. Just my personal bias talking here and Curb Your Enthusiasm is still a masterpiece and Larry David is a great writer. Though you could argue that he only writes for millionaires and for those who believe that millionairehood is a mere few generations away. If you find shouting at the plebs and condemning their taste in shoes hilarious and if you yearn for Victorian values, but in a funny way, then you will love this. I loved it too, but I did feel guilty for doing so, so I'll let myself off!Curb Your Enthusiasm will go down in the annals of rib ticklers that reached the very heights of absurdist masterpieces. It really is brilliant, with superb production values and labyrinthine plot devises that always fall into very funny places. Though it is hard to feel any empathy with millionaires, but this show probably wasn't written for me and my girlfriend. Larry David has been filthy rich for so many years.Now this age issue is the weirdest part of Curb; nobody in this sitcom even notices that Larry David is pushing 70! So his wife looks like his much younger sister (I won't say daughter because of the disturbing imagery, though there is a very funny incest episode, so now I don't know what to think!) and Larry's two best friends speak to our hero as equals, they being an entire generation younger and all, and Larry's attitude to young girls is confusing, I mean, why would an old man act like this to a young girl? Well the answer must be that Larry is pretending to be equal in age to the youngsters. For example, a young an sexy Hank Moody would not look out of place acting all competitive and horrid to young girls (his age), but he would if he was 65. Hand Moody can also insult his friends parents, Larry David can't. So when Larry is forced to apologise to his buds Jewish parents, well, it just didn't work because Larry David is in the same generation as the Jewish parents. If you watch it you must admit that Larry does cast himself as a much younger man.Larry should, however, be commended in this writing skill though, he's that good. I'm only commenting on the miscasting. If Larry shaved his bushy sides, like Sean Connery does, and if he wore sharp clothes, he would have gotten away with the angry old man routine, but he doesn't do this. He grows his sideburns to Charles Darwin bushiness and wears old people's clothes (well the cloths he wore in the 70's, but he was young back then so it looked cool) and he makes no reference to his age in his script, which is weird. This leads the viewer to believe that Larry David is trying to be younger! I'm sorry but that is the only explanation I can think of.Ok, I'm aware that I'm coming across as somewhat patronising to old people, like I'm expecting them to morph into the Dalai Lama on their 64th birthday or something... Ok, I guess I am expecting them to morph into the Dalai Lama on their 64th birthday!If you don't believe me on the miscasting thing, then watch the incest episode, when Larry is with his wife and they bump into Larry's impressive ex girlfriend. She was waaaay too young for him and, more importantly, we see Larry David's wife feeling uncomfortable and so she makes sarcastic comments about the girls' impressive boobs. You would think that she would mention the ex's very young age? I reckon that the wife mentioning the young girls' boobs is a natural defence mechanism. You see, when confronted with a better rival, I would picture the wife giving the feminist line about men only being interested is swelling breasts and this is why she mentioned the girls boobs; but you would also expect the wife to make a snide reference to the age-gap (to give herself a sense of superior oomph, and all that). But this age issue is never ever mentioned in all episodes. And at the end of the incest episode, we meet Larry's uncle. Did you not think that the uncle looked like a 90 year old to balance out Larry's old age? Also the bit were Larry hilariously gets stuck in a box with Ted Danson's old mother in-law, that didn't work either, because, you guessed it; our hero is the same age as the mother in-law. Larry David needed to hire a younger guy to play this part. I really do not mean to be ageist; I am not. I just think that Larry David must have a huge ego to feed (he uses his name `Larry' in the program remember) if he thinks he can pull off the smooth but semidetached existential hero. Ok, he may be a comic writer of the first order, but why not just stay behind the camera? Why take on the reins of your masterpiece and insist on being the main hunky guy? It's analogous to Steven Spielberg elbowing Harrison Ford aside because he's the director and he's going to be Indiana Jones! God, the guy must be a walking beacon of insecurity. Apart from me moaning, this is still one of the funniest and smartest shows out there.... But old folks, many feign as they were dead; Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. O God!

The great moments can be truly classic, however, never more so than in the hour-long pilot, where the concept of the show is not yet fully in place, and the real Larry appears as well as the LD he says (in the commentary) he wishes he could be, who is the main character in the series.In the pilot we get Jerry and Jason Alexander and others talking about what Larry is really like, which is hilarious, and then we get some snippets of him doing stand-up, which is actually damn good. He really oughta do a full stand-up dvd. The pilot is one of the funniest tv episodes I've ever seen.The rest of season one shows Larry settling in to the LD persona he creates, and has many excellent story lines and jokes. Essentially this is a modern comedy of manners and mores; no shortage of material there! I keep thinking of Wycherly and Congreve when I watch this; over 300 years later and we're still caught up in our dumbass conventions that signify nothing but ego and vanity.This show will never be as good as Seinfeld because the characters just aren't as strong (and Jason is a better Larry than Larry ever could be), but the liberties that being on HBO afford lets LD go places Sein never could...but I guess that's kind of a liability in some ways. You've got to work harder for a laugh when you can't say nasty words.This show is starting to get a little tired, but the first four or five seasons have some truly genius moments.

However, Curb Your Enthusiasm was a show that I always stayed away from up until very recently. I have never seen a single episode of Seinfeld, and Curb Your Enthusiasm focuses around the co-creator of that show Larry David. I was worried that refrences to Seinfeld in the show would make things confusing for me. However, after hearing from a countless amount of people how great Curb Your Enthusiasm was, I decided to put my skepticism aside and give it a shot. Curb Your Enthusiasm has to be one of the funniest shows that I have ever seen in my life and despite the few references to Seinfeld, I was able to keep up with no problem. The show is set up in the form of a ""mockumentary"" to show Larry David's life after Seinfeld and  how he spends his time in his daily life. The reason the show is so funny, is because they portray Larry David as a constant victim of circumstance. The brilliance of this show, is that each episode focuses on how Larry's bad luck effects him and others around him. The show is quite addicting because of the fact that each episode manages to come up with new and entertaining ways for Larry to make a fool out of himself.The first season of the show is exteremely funny from start to finish. A few episodes worth mentioning are - ""The Pants Tent"" in which an innocent ""bunch-up"" in Larry's trousers gives rise to a misunderstanding with Cheryl's friend Nancy at the movies; ""Porno Gil"" that focuses on Larry not picking up a golf ball for a person at the driving range, which sets of a bizarrre chain of events in which he is forced to attend a party put on by an ex porn actor named Gil; ""Interior Decorator"" in which Larry politely holds an elevator door for a woman in an office building, which causes Larry to lose his spot at the doctor's office and delay the events of the rest of his day ; and ""Beloved Aunt"" in which Larry offers to use his connections to place an obituary in the newspaper for his wife's aunt. But when the paper comes out, the ""a"" in ""aunt"" has been mistakenly replaced with a ""c"", and his wife's family is convinced that Larry did it on purpose.Overall, Curb Your Enthusiasm is probably one of the funniest shows that I have ever seen, and few shows have managed to match the quality of the writing that Curb Your Enthusiasm offers. My only gripe with the show, is that each season only contains ten 30 minute episodes. The first season DVD set includes all ten first season episodes, as well as the hour long special that inspired the series.

But to me CURB is a major disappointment and an overrated show. Why?First, while David's creativity is intact, he himself is awful. His delivery is awful. His acting is ... awful. So many times, I can see the bits being performed by Jason Alexander (George on Seinfeld) and I start laughing. But David is soporific. He needed the Seinfeld cast as much as they needed him.Second, the pacing of the show is awful. It has an improv feel and supposedly a lot of it is improv. Folks--I'm sorry. But the assumption that actors excel at improv is ludicrous. They don't. The script, as a result, is poorly paced, awkward, and the dialog is often tedious and boring. A lot of good ideas go to waste!Third, no one here evidently knows how to make a TV show. The whole affair, for reasons stated, is just awkward. Mumbling actors with inconsequential lines move around to no end and no purpose.THere are so many times when I see a David idea that screams ""Seinfeld!"" that I want to love this show, but the fact of the matter is that the ideas are great, but the execution is awful, and the show is more tedious than funny.Larry David is the classic example of the Peter Principle. Promoting him to top billing and letting him try to carry a show was a big mistake. On network television he'd flame out quickly and the smug critics would say this was the fault of the tv audience that lacks sophistication.

The funny thing is that even though Larry never knows when to let something go, he is usually in the right concerning the cause, he just doesn't know when to shut the hell up and its this repeated action that makes this a train wreck that is hard to ignore.This first season set included the all 10 season one episodes and the one hour pilot for the show.

780718,A39WM5BQ54J8XY,B0000E2PVR,"Randy E. Aveille ""raveille""","[3, 3]","Curb Your Enthusiasm has all the makings of a classic comedy series. Larry David, writer and star of the show, also co-created the show ""Seinfeld"" with Jerry Seinfeld. David wrote for that series from 1990-96 and returned to write the series finale in 1998. David was Emmy-nominated seven times for his writing on ""Seinfeld,"" and won in 1993 (""Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing in a Comedy Series"") for the now classic episode ""The Contest.""He also shared an Emmy in 1993 for ""Outstanding Comedy Series"" (He has shared a nomination for this award six times.). In 1994 David shared a PGA Golden Laurel Award with Jerry Seinfeld for ""Most Promising Producer in Television."" The second season was nominated for an ""Outstanding Comedy Series"" Emmy.To keep the narrative fresh and spontaneous, Curb Your Enthusiasm is shot without a script; the cast is given scene outlines and often improvise lines as they go. The result is a hysterically capricious show that's unlike anything else on TV. Each half-hour episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm features reality-style footage of David (playing himself) at home, at work and around town, as he gets into predicaments with fictional and real-life personalities.Most of us can probably relate to most of the situations depicted on the show in one way or another. If you watch it enough, you'll probably find one of your own most embarrassing and humiliating moments represented on the show. It's like laughing at your self, but at someone else's expense. The show makes seemingly trivial details of one's day-to-day life (a trip to the movies, a phone call, a visit from some trick-or-treaters), and makes them precipitate a ""Murphy's Law"" chain of misfortune to side-splitting effect.David's writing is once again, fantastic, and the humor is much like that of the Seinfeld show; so if you enjoyed Seinfeld and are craving fresh, new material of that ilk, get HBO and start watching the show. What you will find is that Larry David's style of comedy is as funny as it ever was. Candid, unsparing, and self-deprecating, each show is full of skits that probably reflect a comic exaggeration of David's real-life experiences; and they're hilarious!",5,One of the Best Comedy Series on Cable,1071187200,"12 12, 2003",2003,2194,"['Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'makings', 'classic', 'comedy', 'series', 'Larry', 'David', 'writer', 'star', 'show', 'also', 'co-created', 'show', 'Seinfeld', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'David', 'wrote', 'series', '1990-96', 'returned', 'write', 'series', 'finale', '1998', 'David', 'was', 'Emmy-nominated', 'seven', 'times', 'writing', 'Seinfeld', 'won', '1993', 'Outstanding', 'Individual', 'Achievement', 'Writing', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'now', 'classic', 'episode', 'Contest', 'also', 'shared', 'Emmy', '1993', 'Outstanding', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'shared', 'nomination', 'award', 'six', 'times.', '1994', 'David', 'shared', 'PGA', 'Golden', 'Laurel', 'Award', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Most', 'Promising', 'Producer', 'Television', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'nominated', 'Outstanding', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'Emmy.To', 'keep', 'narrative', 'fresh', 'spontaneous', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'shot', 'script', 'cast', 'given', 'scene', 'outlines', 'often', 'improvise', 'lines', 'go', 'result', 'hysterically', 'capricious', 'show', 'anything', 'else', 'TV', 'half-hour', 'episode', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'reality-style', 'footage', 'David', 'playing', 'home', 'work', 'town', 'predicaments', 'fictional', 'real-life', 'personalities.Most', 'can', 'probably', 'relate', 'most', 'situations', 'depicted', 'show', 'one', 'way', 'watch', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'one', 'own', 'most', 'embarrassing', 'humiliating', 'moments', 'represented', 'show', 'laughing', 'self', 'someone', 'else', 'expense', 'show', 'seemingly', 'trivial', 'details', 'one', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'trip', 'movies', 'phone', 'call', 'visit', 'trick-or-treaters', 'precipitate', 'Murphy', 'Law', 'chain', 'misfortune', 'side-splitting', 'effect.David', 'writing', 'once', 'again', 'fantastic', 'humor', 'much', 'Seinfeld', 'show', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'Seinfeld', 'are', 'craving', 'fresh', 'new', 'material', 'ilk', 'get', 'HBO', 'start', 'watching', 'show', 'What', 'will', 'find', 'Larry', 'David', 'style', 'comedy', 'as', 'funny', 'ever', 'was', 'Candid', 'unsparing', 'self-deprecating', 'show', 'full', 'skits', 'probably', 'reflect', 'comic', 'exaggeration', 'David', 'real-life', 'experiences', ""'re"", 'hilarious']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 1

The show truly got funnier as it went into the second season, and many of the well-known classics are from season 2. Season 1, however, is packed full of the humor that has made this show an instant classic.Essentially, as most of you know, Curb Your Enthusiasm is Seinfeld with the &quot;F&quot; word. When you first watch this show you realize exactly how integral Larry David was to Seinfeld. That same sort of humor completely permeates all these shows. Will they ever run out of uncomfortable situations for Larry to find himself in? It sure doesn't seem like it.This disc is a great value. Each episode has a little description and preview to it (a mini-trailer, so to speak), and some of them have commentaries, which are often hilarious. There is also an extended interview with Bob Costas. This is terrific - many clips from season two are shown and a great deal of insight is revealed as to how the show is written, produced, and filmed. And lastly, there is the one hour documentary that started it all - the special that HBO originally did with Larry David that spawned the show. The only negative thing - there isn't a &quot;play all&quot; option on the DVD, where you just hit one button and let it play through all episodes.

Adding to the strange ""real life"" quality of the show is that the star/creator Larry David plays a character named Larry David and the show is littered with appearances by the likes of Richard Lewis, Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen and Julia Louis-Dreyfus all playing ""themselves"" (or people in alternative realities who look like them and have the same life histories).In another show about nothing, ""Curb"" focuses on the daily life of ""Seinfeld"" co-creator Larry David and maintains many of the qualities of the groundbreaking comedy.  Each episode builds its own plot, with a revolving door of supporting players.  But the show is its star, Larry David.  Fans (or loathers) of George Costanza will see similarities between the fictitious George and the man who created him.  Like George, the neurotic Larry obsesses over events that do not go well, over-analyzes everything, and often is the chief saboteur in destroying his ambitious plans.  Most episodes end with Larry coming face to face with the most disastrous consequences of his conniving ways.""Curb"" is not for everyone, as many of the plots grow from distasteful subject matter and in the Dadaistic sense, challenge conventions and cultural norms for comedy.  Stories are built from incest survivors groups, pants that make Larry appear constantly aroused and the season's most shocking moment, an obituary typo for a ""beloved aunt"" in which the ""a"" is replaced by the worst letter possible for that situation (think about it if you must).Truly avant-garde television, ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" stands on the unconventional shoulders of ""Seinfeld"" and reaches new heights in absurdity and artistic accomplishment.
