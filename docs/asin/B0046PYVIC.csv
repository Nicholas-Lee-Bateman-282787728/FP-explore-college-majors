Despite the poor video quality (watchable, but not great) the show has a real appeal. Somehow the dialogue seems a cut above the average. For instance, one character will hypothesize some goofy theory to explain something, and just as you're saying ""Come'on"" another character in the show will pipe up ""Are you nuts?"".Kenneth Tobey is excellent, as always, and the supporting cast is perfectly fine although I don't recognize any of them. Shows from this era have three unique things going for them:* 30-minute dramas are now extinct for some reason.* There's always a technology angle to the stories (i.e. scuba gear on SeaHunt).* The characters are real people, making a living doing something they love.I find all this a refreshing change from modern TV. Let's hope somebody dredges up a few more of these episodes. FYI, the 8 episodes are picked from across the three seasons of the show so you get to see several models of Bell helicopters.",5,It's always good to see Kenneth Tobey,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,1064,"['have', 'very', 'dim', 'memory', 'seeing', 'show', 'child', ""'m"", 'aviation', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'show', 'again', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'watchable', 'not', 'great', 'show', 'real', 'appeal', 'Somehow', 'dialogue', 'cut', 'average', 'instance', 'one', 'character', 'will', 'hypothesize', 'goofy', 'theory', 'explain', 'something', 'just', ""'re"", 'saying', ""Come'on"", 'character', 'show', 'will', 'pipe', 'up', 'Are', 'nuts', '.Kenneth', 'Tobey', 'excellent', 'always', 'supporting', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'era', 'have', 'three', 'unique', 'things', 'going', '*', '30-minute', 'dramas', 'are', 'now', 'extinct', 'reason', 'always', 'technology', 'angle', 'stories', 'i.e', 'scuba', 'gear', 'SeaHunt', '*', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'making', 'living', 'doing', 'something', 'love.I', 'find', 'refreshing', 'change', 'modern', 'TV', 'Let', 'hope', 'somebody', 'up', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'FYI', '8', 'episodes', 'are', 'picked', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'so', 'get', 'see', 'several', 'models', 'Bell', 'helicopters']",N/A

1387892,A3P8H2VFQ5K605,B0046PYVIC,Dr. Morbius,"[0, 0]","A wonderful Golden Age television series that was filmed by Desilu Studios (yes, that was under the guidance of the ever forward-thinking partnership of Lucy Ball and Desi Arnaz) with the backing of CBS-TV Films although it was a syndicated show, not a CBS program. Some intelligent episodes although a few are pretty silly by today's standards. Many rising stars of the era, such as Robert Vaughn, James Coburn, and Mike Connors, to name a few, appear. Tobey and Hill had great chemistry, with Chuck as a Korean War chopper vet who went into business with a young, upcoming chopper pilot in the decade after the war--the duo are modeled after the L.A.-area based National Helicopter Service which did all the flying appearing in the episodes. Ironic that award-winning ""M*A*S*H"" film director Robert Altman directed many WB episodes. When it came time for him to film ""M*A*S*H"" in 1969, he contacted National Helicopters (the WB aircraft suppliers) and the Bells flew again in front of the cameras. Sadly, there is only one high-quality  collection of this series in a private collector's archive and unlikely to be converted to video anytime in the near future. Also, stories abound that some episodes are lost. The San Fernando Valley airport used as Chuck and P.T.'s base of operations no longer exists; it is now a large trucking facility (sadly, the vanishing rate of America's small airports is far more accelerated today). The surrounding landscape, familiar to T.V. viewers of this series, is nearly unrecognizable today thanks to SoCal suburban sprawl. Yuck! (Aside: The tarnished Golden State these days.) There is a modest Baby Boomer fan following of this show and you can fine two ""reenactors"", billing their air show as ""The New Whirlybirds"", flying a restored Bell chopper to various air shows in the Midwest and elsewhere, notably the annual Rotor Fest at the National Helicopter Museum in West Chester, Pennsylvania USA.",4,Fifties Flyboys,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,1938,"['wonderful', 'Golden', 'Age', 'television', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'Desilu', 'Studios', 'yes', 'was', 'guidance', 'ever', 'forward-thinking', 'partnership', 'Lucy', 'Ball', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'backing', 'CBS-TV', 'Films', 'was', 'syndicated', 'show', 'not', 'CBS', 'program', 'intelligent', 'episodes', 'few', 'are', 'pretty', 'silly', 'today', 'standards', 'Many', 'rising', 'stars', 'era', 'such', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Mike', 'Connors', 'name', 'few', 'appear', 'Tobey', 'Hill', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Chuck', 'Korean', 'War', 'chopper', 'vet', 'who', 'went', 'business', 'young', 'upcoming', 'chopper', 'pilot', 'decade', 'war', 'duo', 'are', 'modeled', 'L.A.-area', 'based', 'National', 'Helicopter', 'Service', 'did', 'flying', 'appearing', 'episodes', 'Ironic', 'award-winning', 'M*A*S*H', 'film', 'director', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'directed', 'many', 'WB', 'episodes', 'When', 'came', 'time', 'film', 'M*A*S*H', '1969', 'contacted', 'National', 'Helicopters', 'WB', 'aircraft', 'suppliers', 'Bells', 'flew', 'again', 'front', 'cameras', 'Sadly', 'only', 'one', 'high-quality', 'collection', 'series', 'private', 'collector', 'archive', 'unlikely', 'be', 'converted', 'video', 'anytime', 'near', 'future', 'Also', 'stories', 'abound', 'episodes', 'are', 'lost', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'airport', 'used', 'Chuck', 'P.T', 'base', 'operations', 'no', 'longer', 'now', 'large', 'trucking', 'facility', 'sadly', 'vanishing', 'rate', 'America', 'small', 'airports', 'far', 'more', 'accelerated', 'today', 'surrounding', 'landscape', 'familiar', 'T.V', 'viewers', 'series', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'today', 'thanks', 'SoCal', 'suburban', 'sprawl', 'Yuck', 'tarnished', 'Golden', 'State', 'days', 'modest', 'Baby', 'Boomer', 'fan', 'following', 'show', 'can', 'fine', 'two', 'reenactors', 'billing', 'air', 'show', 'New', 'Whirlybirds', 'flying', 'restored', 'Bell', 'chopper', 'various', 'air', 'shows', 'Midwest', 'elsewhere', 'notably', 'annual', 'Rotor', 'Fest', 'National', 'Helicopter', 'Museum', 'West', 'Chester', 'Pennsylvania', 'USA']",N/A
