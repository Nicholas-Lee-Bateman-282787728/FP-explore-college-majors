746099,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,B00008OSD9,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[1, 1]","Typecasting can be fatal to an actor's career, as Mark Holton will forever be known as ""Francis Buxton"" from ""Pee Wee's big Adventure."" But in ""Gacy,"" he does step out of that, and he does a decent job at it.John W. Gacy was a horrible man, raised in a harsh environment by an abusive father. People have tried to blame Gacy's behavior on a head injury but the post-mortem didn't show anything. It could be any number of things, but 29 boys and young men didn't bury themselves in the crawlspace under his house. In the end, police connected him to 33 murders (and there could have been even more), which earned him the death penalty.In this film, the viewer gets a glimpse of how it was when he was a boy; his relationship(ha)with his father, which really did inflict some psychological scars on him. It then goes into a narration which tells of his prison term, his early release, and his attempt to rebuild his life. No mention of his first marriage or the family which broke up due to his crime, or why he got into being a clown for kids' parties.There are a lot of frustrating leaps in the storyline, jumping from scene to scene, often with no build-up or release; just a series of seemingly disconected exposition, but one does get a pretty good idea that something is wrong with this situation. Why is there such a foul odor coming from this guy's house? Yes, we see some nasty looking sludge being sump-pumped out of his house, and the neighbors are having a problem with the resultant biohazard which is developing, and his second wife makes a discovery no wife wants to make (""What have I married"" reaction).Understandably, no normal-length film can tell the entire story, there will be omissions, but so much of the Gacy story is left to the imagination, which usually only works in fiction. This is told as a true story, but the writers took many liberties to tell this story, which isn't completely true, as told here. Although the general idea is there.As far as movies go, ""Gacy"" isn't necessarily a bad film. It informs those who don't know of him, and frustrates those who know the story.P.S.Read the other reviews of this movie, positive and negative. They all have Gacy's name appended to the word ahead of it. There is no space between any word which preceeds Gacy's name and the name itself. I wonder why this is so?",3,Could (should) have been better,1299888000,"03 12, 2011",2011,2337,"['Typecasting', 'can', 'be', 'fatal', 'actor', 'career', 'Mark', 'Holton', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'known', 'Francis', 'Buxton', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'big', 'Adventure', 'Gacy', 'step', 'decent', 'job', 'it.John', 'W.', 'Gacy', 'was', 'horrible', 'man', 'raised', 'harsh', 'environment', 'abusive', 'father', 'People', 'have', 'tried', 'blame', 'Gacy', 'behavior', 'head', 'injury', 'post-mortem', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'number', 'things', '29', 'boys', 'young', 'men', 'did', ""n't"", 'bury', 'crawlspace', 'house', 'end', 'police', 'connected', '33', 'murders', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'earned', 'death', 'penalty.In', 'film', 'viewer', 'glimpse', 'how', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'boy', 'relationship', 'ha', 'father', 'really', 'did', 'inflict', 'psychological', 'scars', 'then', 'narration', 'prison', 'term', 'early', 'release', 'attempt', 'rebuild', 'life', 'mention', 'first', 'marriage', 'family', 'broke', 'up', 'due', 'crime', 'why', 'got', 'being', 'clown', 'kids', 'parties.There', 'are', 'lot', 'frustrating', 'leaps', 'storyline', 'jumping', 'scene', 'scene', 'often', 'build-up', 'release', 'just', 'series', 'seemingly', 'disconected', 'exposition', 'one', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'something', 'wrong', 'situation', 'Why', 'such', 'foul', 'odor', 'coming', 'guy', 'house', 'Yes', 'see', 'nasty', 'looking', 'sludge', 'being', 'sump-pumped', 'house', 'neighbors', 'are', 'having', 'problem', 'resultant', 'biohazard', 'developing', 'second', 'wife', 'discovery', 'wife', 'make', 'What', 'have', 'married', 'reaction', '.Understandably', 'normal-length', 'film', 'can', 'tell', 'entire', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'omissions', 'so', 'much', 'Gacy', 'story', 'left', 'imagination', 'usually', 'only', 'fiction', 'told', 'true', 'story', 'writers', 'took', 'many', 'liberties', 'tell', 'story', ""n't"", 'completely', 'true', 'told', 'here', 'general', 'idea', 'there.As', 'far', 'movies', 'go', 'Gacy', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'film', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'frustrates', 'who', 'know', 'story.P.S.Read', 'other', 'reviews', 'movie', 'positive', 'negative', 'have', 'Gacy', 'name', 'appended', 'word', 'ahead', 'space', 'word', 'Gacy', 'name', 'name', 'wonder', 'why', 'so']",Gacy

746102,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00008OSD9,B. E Jackson,"[3, 4]","Gacy was a disturbing movie to watch.  It's about a guy who does the worst things imaginable to teenage boys.  Eventually the bugs and the smell get so bad... yeah it's the kind of storyline that will make you think... and make you sick.The movie moves along at a pace that's almost too realistic.  The guy going around doing horrible things to boys has serious problems in his head because of his father beating and sexually abusing him as a child.Eventually the cops get suspicious, soon after his wife finds out about her husbands sexual preferences by way of magazines he has hidden away (but that's all- she did NOT know about the other bad things he was doing at the time).The guy has serious mental problems too- people would call him names and he would totally flip out with unbelievable rage.  It was incredibly disturbing how many murders he was getting away with.  It seemed whenever he was committing a murder nobody would be around to catch him in the act.The movie seems to focus on the roaches and worms crawling around the dead bodies.  Why I don't know.  Unless the movie directors wanted to focus on how disgusting it is when dead bodies are rotting away.  The bodies were stored in his basement.It was interesting how the guys neighbors, the cops, and other people all noticed an extremely bad smell but didn't realize what was causing it or where it was coming from.  Also interesting is that the guys wife and mother didn't even notice any smell.  Perhaps the writers forgot to include them in the nose-grabbing stink scenes!I thought the movie was easy to understand, not really confusing, and the story rolled along at a comfortable and understandable pace.",5,sick movie,1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,1680,"['Gacy', 'was', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'watch', 'guy', 'who', 'worst', 'things', 'imaginable', 'teenage', 'boys', 'Eventually', 'bugs', 'smell', 'get', 'so', 'bad', 'kind', 'storyline', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'make', 'sick.The', 'movie', 'moves', 'along', 'pace', 'almost', 'too', 'realistic', 'guy', 'going', 'doing', 'horrible', 'things', 'boys', 'serious', 'problems', 'head', 'father', 'beating', 'sexually', 'abusing', 'child.Eventually', 'cops', 'get', 'suspicious', 'soon', 'wife', 'out', 'husbands', 'sexual', 'preferences', 'way', 'magazines', 'hidden', 'away', 'all-', 'did', 'NOT', 'know', 'other', 'bad', 'things', 'was', 'doing', 'time', '.The', 'guy', 'serious', 'mental', 'problems', 'too-', 'people', 'would', 'call', 'names', 'would', 'totally', 'flip', 'out', 'unbelievable', 'rage', 'was', 'incredibly', 'disturbing', 'how', 'many', 'murders', 'was', 'getting', 'away', 'seemed', 'whenever', 'was', 'committing', 'murder', 'nobody', 'would', 'be', 'catch', 'act.The', 'movie', 'focus', 'roaches', 'worms', 'crawling', 'dead', 'bodies', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'directors', 'wanted', 'focus', 'how', 'disgusting', 'when', 'dead', 'bodies', 'are', 'rotting', 'away', 'bodies', 'were', 'stored', 'basement.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'how', 'guys', 'neighbors', 'cops', 'other', 'people', 'noticed', 'extremely', 'bad', 'smell', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'what', 'was', 'causing', 'where', 'was', 'coming', 'Also', 'interesting', 'guys', 'wife', 'mother', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'smell', 'Perhaps', 'writers', 'forgot', 'include', 'nose-grabbing', 'stink', 'scenes', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'easy', 'understand', 'not', 'really', 'confusing', 'story', 'rolled', 'along', 'comfortable', 'understandable', 'pace']",Gacy
746103,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00008OSD9,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I was born in Iowa in the early 60s, within an hour drive or so of where John Wayne Gacy was a manager of three Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants.  Since I lived in Iowa until my mid-teens, I believe that I'm qualified to make the following assertion:  In Iowa, Mr. Gacy surely never fit in.He was surely a psychopath, no doubt about that.  He liked to kill kids -- and perhaps even do worse than that, if that is possible -- and then bury them in his crawlspace.  He liked to dress up as a clown, but in reality, perhaps that was when he was showing his true self.  But perhaps his biggest weakness:  when it comes to a murderer, he just wasn't what I'd call a ""sexy"" serial killer.  Hey, women were fighting each other at the courthouse to get close enough to become the wife of Richard Ramirez, however sick and twisted that might be.  And even one was the ""winner.""  A woman wanted to be married to Ted Bundy so badly that she hung out in a courtroom day after day to have her chance at that ""charmer.""  Gacy?  He was already married, but more than likely, his wife wanted out of that deal.And this is surely not what I would call a ""sexy"" film.  I've tried to watch it a couple of times, and just gave up in the beginning of the second act both times.  I just think that the acting's not all that great, the production values aren't that great, the direction is off, and the screenplay surely could have been better.Supposedly, Mr. Gacy was not a cannibal, and that's one of the only good things that I can say about him really.  But that didn't mean that he was a vegetarian; after all, he seemed to like eating chicken.  And as any good Iowan knows, ""Beef; it's what's for dinner.""

In the beginning we see Gacy's father as abusive, trying to make his son macho. Perhaps Gacy was not raised in an environment of love, so such human qualities as compassion were not there. He puts on a good front as a cover as being ""Mr. Nice Guy"" in his community. With so many bodies buried in his property there was some serious stinking going on yet the real life Gacy he had dozens buried in there and still nobody knew.His neighborhood did not have bright people living there apparently.I thought the movie was done well. I enjoyed it. It makes you think of all the prostitutes out there they can indeed become prime targets for the loonies and sickos out there. How many people out there got killed and nobody knew because they had no family or anybody who cared about them. Scary thought. It makes you wonder...I had no idea Gacy's last words were ""Kiss my ass"" just before lethal injection, and that he picked up approximately 2,000 men.So just how many more were murdered?",5,Gacy not a bad movie,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,1354,"['never', 'seen', 'Adventures', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Herman', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'Mark', 'Holton', 'was', 'can', 'not', 'compair', 'two', 'thus', 'having', 'more', 'objective', 'view', 'movie', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Gacy', 'Nobody', 'can', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'serial', 'killer', 'mind', ""n't"", 'try', 'anything', 'depth', 'terms', 'psychological', 'makeup', 'attempts', 'make', 'insights', 'beginning', 'see', 'Gacy', 'father', 'abusive', 'trying', 'make', 'son', 'macho', 'Perhaps', 'Gacy', 'was', 'not', 'raised', 'environment', 'love', 'such', 'human', 'qualities', 'compassion', 'were', 'not', 'there', 'good', 'front', 'cover', 'being', 'Mr.', 'Nice', 'Guy', 'community', 'so', 'many', 'bodies', 'buried', 'property', 'was', 'serious', 'stinking', 'going', 'yet', 'real', 'life', 'Gacy', 'had', 'dozens', 'buried', 'still', 'nobody', 'knew.His', 'neighborhood', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'bright', 'people', 'living', 'there', 'apparently.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'prostitutes', 'out', 'there', 'can', 'indeed', 'become', 'prime', 'targets', 'loonies', 'sickos', 'out', 'there', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'there', 'got', 'killed', 'nobody', 'knew', 'had', 'family', 'anybody', 'who', 'cared', 'Scary', 'thought', 'wonder', 'had', 'idea', 'Gacy', 'last', 'words', 'were', 'Kiss', 'ass', 'just', 'lethal', 'injection', 'picked', 'up', 'approximately', '2,000', 'men.So', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'were', 'murdered']",Gacy
746111,A1AQ9R3L8ZWWEC,B00008OSD9,"LMG ""ancient art prof""","[1, 1]","The title selected for this review reflects both the movie and Gacy's crawlspace. Many have given kudos to the actor playing Gacy and they are deserved. As for the rest of the film: 1)It starts off with what is almost a mere cameo appearance by Adam Baldwin as Gacy's father who suddenly and jarringly abuses his youthful son both physically and emotionally while on a fishing trip. The reason for this behavior is never revealed. And how did the producers of this film know what took place during that camping incident? There were no witnesses. 2)Fast forward from 1953 to 1976 and we are immediately made aware of the crawling life forms that inhabit Gacy's crawlspace with absolutely no story lead in. (Indeed, there is a fixation on the part of the filmmakers to dwell on the creepy crawlers which makes it even more ridiculous that no one wonders more about this aberrant situation.) Something should have been inserted in the storyline beforehand to give at least a hint of Gacy's motivation. All those who have been physically and emotionally abused by a parent, relative, or stranger don't necessarily turn into mass murderers of young men.As noted by other reviewers, as depicted here, the unabashed stupidity and ignorance on the part of those who work with Gacy or have contact with him as neighbors as to what may be going on is astounding. Certainly a red flag should have gone up when an exterminator who was brought in to clean up the crawlspace was almost overwhelmed by the sight and smell of his encounter. Policemen, who should have recognized the smell of death, were oblivious to what their noses told them. Strange black ooze that suddenly appeared coming up on a neighbor's lawn was not oil. And wouldn't that ooze have demanded attention to make sure that it wasn't toxic? When Gacy nearly bludgeoned to death one of his workers who stopped him in mid-air from delivering the final fatal blow, the guy accepts an apology and continues working for Gacy. Incredible! Did these young men have a lobotomy prior to being hired?That Gacy's wife was so out of it is also bewildering. That neither she nor her two daughters ever saw anything suspicious is more than a puzzlement. Were they all in denial? You cannot pick up 2000 boys (according to the film), kill at least 29+ and not leave some sort of trail. Yet, Gacy quite obviously did succeed in fooling people. And, as stated by others, this movie gives more insight into those who surrounded Gacy than Gacy himself.Overall, the movie has a disjointed quality, is poorly edited, and has sudden shifts that make one scratch one's head. The two detectives who show up at the end to follow Gacy look more like sloppy bounty hunters and give the impression that they never did put 2 and 2 together. Even their appearance in the first place is somewhat iffy. Gacy's ""boarder"", played by a young Charlie Weber, dumps his girlfriend without telling the audience why and we are left to surmise that she told ""Tom"" about Gacy's advances and he didn't believe her. Yet, Tom must have had some inkling of what Gacy was all about since he was living in the house for awhile and the rooms weren't exactly sound proof. And no one ever paid attention to any screams or the sight of a young man being dragged into Gacy's garage. A sexual move on Gacy's part towards Tom was explained as a ""trust test"" and the young man bought it. He was even stupid enough to let Gacy put handcuffs on him as part of a dare which nearly cost him his life.What all this adds up to is a movie that takes on a generic horror veneer that could have been made without any reference to John Wayne Gacy at all. Only the performance by the titular actor saved it from getting a single star from me. See Friday the 13th of any number and it will make more sense than GACY. The former will also be scarier and better done. Don't buy this turkey which takes advantage of a real life horrific situation and turns it into cinema fluff. It has absolutely no socially redeeming qualities unless one wants to believe that, starting in the 1970s at the latest, we are witnessing the total dumbing down of America and the rise of unspeakable soulless murder.",2,IT STINKS!,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,4181,"['title', 'selected', 'review', 'movie', 'Gacy', 'crawlspace', 'Many', 'have', 'given', 'kudos', 'actor', 'playing', 'Gacy', 'are', 'deserved', 'rest', 'film', '1', 'what', 'almost', 'mere', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'Gacy', 'father', 'who', 'suddenly', 'jarringly', 'youthful', 'son', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'fishing', 'trip', 'reason', 'behavior', 'never', 'revealed', 'how', 'did', 'producers', 'film', 'know', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'camping', 'incident', 'were', 'witnesses', '2', 'Fast', 'forward', '1953', '1976', 'are', 'immediately', 'made', 'aware', 'crawling', 'life', 'forms', 'inhabit', 'Gacy', 'crawlspace', 'absolutely', 'story', 'lead', 'Indeed', 'fixation', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'dwell', 'creepy', 'crawlers', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'one', 'more', 'aberrant', 'situation', 'Something', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'inserted', 'storyline', 'beforehand', 'give', 'least', 'hint', 'Gacy', 'motivation', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'abused', 'parent', 'relative', 'stranger', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'turn', 'mass', 'murderers', 'young', 'men.As', 'noted', 'other', 'reviewers', 'depicted', 'here', 'unabashed', 'stupidity', 'ignorance', 'part', 'who', 'work', 'Gacy', 'have', 'contact', 'as', 'neighbors', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'astounding', 'Certainly', 'red', 'flag', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'up', 'when', 'exterminator', 'who', 'was', 'brought', 'clean', 'up', 'crawlspace', 'was', 'almost', 'overwhelmed', 'sight', 'smell', 'encounter', 'Policemen', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'recognized', 'smell', 'death', 'were', 'oblivious', 'what', 'noses', 'told', 'Strange', 'black', 'ooze', 'suddenly', 'appeared', 'coming', 'up', 'neighbor', 'lawn', 'was', 'not', 'oil', 'would', ""n't"", 'that', 'ooze', 'have', 'demanded', 'attention', 'make', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'toxic', 'When', 'Gacy', 'nearly', 'bludgeoned', 'death', 'one', 'workers', 'who', 'stopped', 'mid-air', 'delivering', 'final', 'fatal', 'blow', 'guy', 'apology', 'working', 'Gacy', 'Incredible', 'Did', 'young', 'men', 'have', 'lobotomy', 'prior', 'being', 'hired', 'Gacy', 'wife', 'was', 'so', 'also', 'bewildering', 'two', 'daughters', 'ever', 'saw', 'anything', 'suspicious', 'more', 'puzzlement', 'Were', 'denial', 'can', 'not', 'pick', 'up', '2000', 'boys', 'according', 'film', 'kill', 'least', '29+', 'not', 'leave', 'sort', 'trail', 'Gacy', 'quite', 'obviously', 'did', 'succeed', 'fooling', 'people', 'stated', 'others', 'movie', 'more', 'insight', 'who', 'surrounded', 'Gacy', 'Gacy', 'himself.Overall', 'movie', 'disjointed', 'quality', 'poorly', 'edited', 'sudden', 'shifts', 'make', 'one', 'scratch', 'one', 'head', 'two', 'detectives', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'end', 'follow', 'Gacy', 'look', 'more', 'sloppy', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'give', 'impression', 'never', 'did', 'put', '2', '2', 'together', 'Even', 'appearance', 'first', 'place', 'somewhat', 'iffy', 'Gacy', 'boarder', 'played', 'young', 'Charlie', 'Weber', 'girlfriend', 'telling', 'audience', 'why', 'are', 'left', 'surmise', 'told', 'Tom', 'Gacy', 'advances', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Tom', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'inkling', 'what', 'Gacy', 'was', 'was', 'living', 'house', 'awhile', 'rooms', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sound', 'proof', 'one', 'ever', 'paid', 'attention', 'screams', 'sight', 'young', 'man', 'being', 'dragged', 'Gacy', 'garage', 'sexual', 'move', 'Gacy', 'part', 'towards', 'Tom', 'was', 'explained', 'trust', 'test', 'young', 'man', 'bought', 'was', 'even', 'stupid', 'enough', 'let', 'Gacy', 'put', 'handcuffs', 'part', 'dare', 'nearly', 'cost', 'life.What', 'up', 'movie', 'generic', 'horror', 'veneer', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'reference', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Gacy', 'Only', 'performance', 'titular', 'actor', 'saved', 'getting', 'single', 'star', 'See', 'Friday', '13th', 'number', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'GACY', 'former', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'scarier', 'better', 'done', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'turkey', 'advantage', 'real', 'life', 'horrific', 'situation', 'cinema', 'fluff', 'absolutely', 'socially', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'one', 'believe', 'starting', '1970s', 'latest', 'are', 'witnessing', 'total', 'dumbing', 'America', 'rise', 'unspeakable', 'soulless', 'murder']",Gacy

Most of the events in this film was incorrect not to mention they made him look like a total idiot when it came to his own contracting business and especially how people felt about him. Now from all the research that i have done about Gacy, he was a successful business man and most people in town loved him but in this film they make him look like a crook and a person that wasn't liked. I expected this film to have been a lot better... it reminded me about the movie ALI, which was also horribly done. The movie was incorrect, boring and the acting was just sickening. I do not admire Gacy infact i think he was a sick, demented person but all i asked for was a film that was well done.When i picked this film up i did not expect it to be a ""Award winning film"" or even as good as the movie FROM HELL (Jack The Ripper), and i knew it was going to be a low budget film, but was there any money invested in it or what?

I loved the scene where he drowned the kid he got the car from, and the kid crawls out of the bathroom and dies right behind John's mom(asleep in a chair) I know my killer trivia but that movie added more to my knowledge than what I already knew. I think it's worth seeing, rent it or buy it, it's pretty good. Well I'm done for now folks, 'till next time. Stay outta trouble.

The movie shows how he picked his victims, the type of family he had, how he was &quot;respected&quot; in the community and how his neighbors constantly complained about the foul smells coming from his basement.Overall, the movie was decent and held our interest except that it would skip from one scene to another too fast and too often.

If you are a slasher movie fan, this movie is not for you for there is no gore and no bloody killing scenes. The movie starts off showing Gacy as a young boy on a hunting trip in the woods with his father. We see that his father would taunt him with insults and put downs. We then see Gacy as an adult who is married living what seemed to be a normal life. Gacy's mother lived with them also. To everyone who knew him, Gacy seemed the model citizen. He would throw parties and volunteered as a clown at the hospital. What everyone didn't know is that Gacy was a cold blooded murderer killing many young men. Neighbors start complaining about the awful odor coming from Gacy's basement. Gacy always passed this off as having had a sewer pipe broken. In actuality, the stench was coming from numerous bodies Gacy had buried in the crawlspace underneath his home. When the complaints got so bad, Gacy started using lime to cover up the smell. Gacy would sometimes pose as a police officer in order to lure young boys into his vehicle. He had his own construction type company and employed young men. When Gacy's wife finds sex toys he had hidden, she confronts him and he denies all but she is not convinced and leaves him. The killings go on as Gacy rides around and finds more victims. All of whom end up buried in the crawlspace of his home. Gacy kills so many young men, that he actually runs out of burial room. After an employee reports him to the police, they stake out his home which Gacy actually seemed to enjoy. Gacy would taunt the police and enjoyed playing a cat and mouse game with them. Eventually, he is caught and when local authorities visit the crawlspace to his home, they find Gacy's own gruesome ""cemetery"" crawling with maggots and roaches. It is then discovered that almost 30 bodies are buried there. Chicago was shocked to find out that they had such a serial killer living there like an ordinary citizen. This movie is interesting because it does give us a glimpse into the sick mind of Gacy. However it does so without horror and gore. I'd recommend renting this movie.

They are usually cheaply made, direct-to-video films, with an inexperienced cast, trying to profiteer on the infamy of these evil men. That being said, I decided to watch Gacy anyway, because of all the insane people who became infamous, John Wayne Gacy, may have been the craziest. This married man with kids, ran a construction business, that only employed young boys, and on the weekends, he made extra money by dressing up as a clown for children's birthday parties. This man was seen as a wimpy, harmless, closeted guy, no one would have ever thought they'd find 27 bodies underneath his house. The producers of the film, Gacy, decided to take it in a different direction than similar films by introducing Gacy as this loveable loser. If you didn't know the story and just popped in the film for the hell of it, I'd have thought this was some kind of comedy....until it wasn't. Veteran character actor, Mark Holton, stars as Gacy and was terrific, he was honestly the only reason to watch the film, especially after it turned. The story is horrific and the rest of the cast amounts to little more than eye candy, but Holton really pulls everything together, takes you inside Gacy's tortured mind, and makes this movie more than just another slasher film. After watching Gacy, I did what everyone else would do and Wiki'ed John Wayne Gacy. I wasn't surprised to see that the film is considered to be wildly inaccurate. Obviously five people aren't going to live in a house with 27 rotting bodies underneath and be almost completely oblivious to it, so I knew the film probably had a lot of bull @#$% in it.

Yes, I agree w/ some as far as a chronicle type movie ""documentary"" this is not, and w/ that out of the way, this is a movie that keeps you thinking, and NOW Mark Holten's face is Gacy's to me, and I have to keep seperating the 2 when I'm talking about or thinking about serial killers. His portrayal is that damn good! If you wanna get an idea of his character (personality) I like the book...The LAST VICTIM...it has a real-life almost intimately deadly encounter w/ a young guy who had balls enough to see Gacy alone...and POW his oh so friendly demeanor is shredded w/ his real personality, also there is letters written to this guy by Gacy. Anywho back to the movie. This movie was so eery, and I kept thinking about the torture scenes ie...water and strangulation over a long crobar type object. In all the reading/watching about serial killers it always has me paranoid about the ""nice- happy happy joy joy people"" cause I don't feel that is the ""norm"" for better lack of a word. I'm wondering what was practice for Mark or what he did to get ready for the role? He was so believable. I do wish this was a longer film showing more of the killings, because in this film you'll see him physically kill like one guy, and next thing you know it's like 20 guys later.",4,Gacy -O- Rama!,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,1500,"['1st', 'Mark', 'Holten', 'Yes', 'Mark', 'was', 'bully', '1st', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'movie', 'Who', 'hell', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'capable', 'nicely', 'seasoned', 'now', 'do', 'say', 'so', 'DO', 'love', 'sickening', 'movies..perverse', '8mm', '7', 'etc', 'Yes', 'agree', 'w/', 'as', 'far', 'chronicle', 'type', 'movie', 'documentary', 'not', 'w/', 'way', 'movie', 'thinking', 'NOW', 'Mark', 'Holten', 'face', 'Gacy', 'have', 'keep', 'seperating', '2', 'when', ""'m"", 'talking', 'thinking', 'serial', 'killers', 'portrayal', 'damn', 'good', 'wan', 'get', 'idea', 'character', 'personality', 'like', 'book', 'LAST', 'VICTIM', 'real-life', 'almost', 'intimately', 'deadly', 'encounter', 'w/', 'young', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'balls', 'enough', 'see', 'Gacy', 'alone', 'POW', 'oh', 'so', 'friendly', 'demeanor', 'shredded', 'real', 'personality', 'also', 'letters', 'written', 'guy', 'Gacy', 'Anywho', 'back', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'eery', 'kept', 'thinking', 'torture', 'ie', 'water', 'strangulation', 'long', 'crobar', 'type', 'object', 'reading/watching', 'serial', 'killers', 'always', 'paranoid', 'nice-', 'happy', 'happy', 'joy', 'joy', 'people', 'cause', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'norm', 'better', 'lack', 'word', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'practice', 'Mark', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'ready', 'role', 'was', 'so', 'believable', 'do', 'wish', 'was', 'longer', 'film', 'showing', 'more', 'killings', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'physically', 'kill', 'one', 'guy', 'next', 'thing', 'know', '20', 'guys', 'later']",Gacy
