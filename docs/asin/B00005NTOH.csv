670403,A30MC3GLA7U5JB,B00005NTOH,ADAM M LENHARDT,"[2, 8]","' Freddy Got Fingered ' is a moving, often touching character piece about the love/hate relationship that exists between fathers and sons. Gordie ( Tom Green ) is an unmotivated 28 yr. old, still residing at home. His father ( Rip Torn ) wants his oldest son to be a success, to ' Make Daddy proud '. When Gordie is unable to live up to his father's rather high expectations, his father shows his dark side, and the conflict becomes intense. In one particular scene, Gordie, at a nice restaurant with his new lady friend, is confronted by his father, who happens to be dining there as well. Gordie's father is most unhappy to find out that Gordie is putting on a charade for his girlfriend, wearing Dad's suit and pretending to be an important businessman. Gordie is in fact jobless, and his father exposes his ruse. What follows is a tense, breathtaking scene, a seminal moment for father/son. Powerful stuff. Gordie eventually learns to become more responsible, and in the finale, father and son share a bonding experience that is life-changing for the both. A stunning, hypnotic character study in the spirit of ' American Beauty ' and ' In The Bedroom ', ' Freddy Got Fingered ' is a landmark film that will stay with you forever.

Many people are holding signs, one of which says, ""When the ... is this movie going to end?""  And if a film acknowledges its own limitations, perhaps you can't be too harsh on it.And then again, perhaps you can.  Although Tom Green can't be faulted for being pretentious, he can be faulted for making a pretty damn bad film.  Essentially, the plot serves solely as a mechanism to string a bunch of ridiculous skits together.  I give the movie three stars because you have to admire Tom's dedication- the man will do literally anything for a laugh, and I freely admit laughing quite a bit during the viewing of Freddy Got Fingered.In short, if you're familiar with Tom Green's comedy and you like it, this is worth checking out.

From time to time I used to watch the Tom Green show on MTV. There were times when I laughed my butt off and there were times where my head was spinning from the demented, twisted skits that just passed before my eyes. Tom Green is the type of guy that dresses like a court jester and entertains you...and just when you start to laugh at his childish, nonsensical antics, he slams you in the back of the head with a sledgehammer. At least on MTV, his skits were kept to a few minutes a piece within a 30-minute time slot. That is the forum that is best suited for him! It allows him some freedom, while maintaining some control. That's the problem that plagues this movie. It is 87 minutes of those bizarre gags thrown on top of a movie that barely ... has a plot.From what I understand, the ""plot"" goes like this...Tom Green plays a 28-year-old guy who has 2 goals in life, to be animator and to move out of his parents' house. The movie starts out with him going to Hollywood armed only with his drawings and his dreams. When he gets there, we realize his body of work consists of a few pieces of paper with pictures on it and he doesn't have a plot for the cartoon. That's it.... That's the whole movie.... I can only imagine that he walked into the studio with this script under his arm in that same fashion!! The rest of the movie is just a series of skits that are vile, disturbing and every once in a while, a little funny.... The only way to describe this movie is...it's like a bad acid trip!!!!

Also thrown in is an absurd sub-plot in which Gord's abusive dad is accused of &quot;fingering Freddy,&quot; his younger brother.The ridicules plot is just an excuse for Tom Green to run around screaming for an hour and a half, and act like a retard.

(I Dare not Mock the people who Disagree with me; there are probably a Lot More of them, my Mother for one)In this Ill-Conceived but none-the-less Hilarious film, TV Funny man Tom Green makes the Dangerous Leap to the Big Screen. (and falls to his Death by the hand of an Angry mob of Critics and Paying Audiences) It looks like a Biography of his life, but for His sake I hope it Wasn't. Green plays Gord Brody, a 28-year-old Slacker who lives in his Parents Basement and Dreams of becoming an Animator. Standing in his way are A: Lack of Talent, B: His Father (Rip Torn) and C: His New Job at the Cheese Factory.The Plot is pretty Inconsequential as it's All just an Excuse for Green to Display his Brand of Physical, Gross Out Comedy. Green will either Make or Break this film for you, if you've never found him funny Before, this film is Definitely not for you, if you Enjoy his TV Antics, you'll most likely Enjoy the Film. He does take Gross out comedy to the Extreme, so Be Prepared. Some of it is Stomach-Churningly Shocking, some of it is Gut-Wretchingly Gross, All of it is Hilarious.

Barr ""Craig  Barr""","[3, 6]","""Freddy Got Fingered"" is a misunderstood film about a father who doesn't respect his son & the son who eventually gains his fathers respect. The narrative is masked by politically incorrect pyrotechnics that were necessary to commit this work as being historically the most shockingly repulsive American made film. This film has little violence and a real life story. There are not any scenes of human hate or non consensual sex, no human torture or malice, just misunderstanding. American film goers can sit through scenes of people being disemboweled, shot to death and violently raped but when a man touches a penis of a horse we are shocked. If Tom Green were to grab the penis of a dog that would be less shocking only because sublimated penis envy is intolerable. The horse has an amazingly  huge cock and males are threatened & repulsed by that. The protagonist is also socially challenged and that is a disability which is also intolerable. But, take away all of the adornments and there is a simple narrative of a father who's traditional beliefs of a career undermine his relationship and respect for his son. The father being the antagonist has disdain towards art as a career therefore overlooking his son's creative talents which reach far beyond animation but also include a knack for humorous writing. The son goes through a social ritual of fire and proves to his father his worthiness. The story is one of which 99 percent of fathers and son's share today and throughout history as well as in Shakespearean drama. So, dog this film if you want to but we all live the story and this one at least has a happy ending!

Any decent person will declare Tom Green the AntiChrist after viewing this film.  But, in an EXTREMELY twisted and bizarre sort of way, it is also very funny and sweet.Granted, he definitely takes things WAY over the top, down the other side, and all the way back for more, but, like it or not, that is the very reason that Tom Green exists in the first place.  His MTV show was all about pushing the boundaries of what you can say or do on TV, and this movie is all about doing absolutely anything to get a laugh.  You have to understand that Tom Green does not do these things because he thinks you will laugh, he does them because they make HIM laugh.  Twirling a newborn over his head by the umbilical cord, manually stimulating farm animals, having a young boy get battered and bloodied every time he appears oncreen, these are all things that Tom finds funny.  The truly amazing thing about this movie is that, through all of the gross-out crap and very, very, stupid things he does throughout, it still somehow manages to come across as innocent and sweet.  The critics and most people, really, will not agree with that statement at all, but it is all done in good humor.  He's not neccesarily trying to shock YOU, but rather he is attempting to one-up himself in each successive scene.Tom Green is an artist, and though his vision is distorted and bizarre, he is still an artist, like it or not.  Even if you take away the gross-out humor, of which there is a lot, the movie is still peppered with brilliant bits.  The backwards man, getting past a security gate with gibberish, the &quot;Daddy would you like some sausage?&quot; bit, these, taken out of context, are hilarious and ingenious.

670431,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00005NTOH,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[2, 4]","Tom Green plays an aspiring cartoonist who traveled to California to try selling his work while working at a cheese factory.  He failed to sell a pitch to an animation mogul, but the mogul gave him advice to follow the animals of his drawings, thinking like them so he can make a better pitch next time.  And the movie gets really nasty and incomprehensible from here.When Canadians in the media wanted to make something gross,theyusuallydeliver.  But Tom Green showed his kind what being gross is all aboot, and he outdid it in the most rancid, loud, offensive, and indecent way possible.  And I had to suffer as the consequence, yet for such a beatdown I'm about to give ""Freddy Got Fingered"", there was sadly a time that I once like Tom Green's mental antics.  It was the days that I thought wearing a red NY cap backwards was cool, so it's easy to see how easy I was to laugh at anything ""The Tom Green Show"" had to offer, even his cancer special and ""Bum Bum"" song. He can be a pretty amusing guy under firm restraints, not to push the FCC limits but still be wild enough to chalk at anything.  Watching him take the director's seat on a feature-length film proves that some things are best left restricted.There's nothing remotely story-driven in the film after Tom meets with the animation mogul.  You think a premise like 'be like an animal' would be serviceable enoughfor a Rob Schneider movie, but nope, Tom Green disregard the plot and have the entire movie be a series of unused sketches from his old show.Bud and Doylegot nothing on how reprehensibly destructive Tom Green's character can be.  Whenever he's not causing harm towards others and express motions in a retarded gesture, he's making conflict with his vindictive father (Rip Torn) whether by simply TOMfoolery in the bathroom or making sausages tied to a piano. I wanted to sympathize with the father, but he can be just as rude and abrasive as his son, and what's bizarre, he can easily forgive Tom for everything he destroys just for him having a job; their relationship is so destructive and uncanny, they make Bam Margera and his father look like Mormons.Tom's character's actions are uncalled for.  The monstrosity 'handles' objects from horses and elephants, threatened to use the gun on himself, cut up a deer's carcass and wear it as a disguise only to be hit by truck (and survive, sadly enough), and chewed up an umbilical cord like spaghetti and used the newborn baby as a lasso.  He's not only crazy, he's dangerous.  He's a disturbed human being that needs to be psychologically evaluated and be lobotomized, certainly not from the people in this movie.  The side characters seem to be in their own little world, either not acknowledging his behavior or tolerating it: he has best friend he abused yet the friend's still with him, he manage to get a wheelchair-bound woman with a strange masochistic attitude who supported him, his mother doesn't understand reason, and an family psychologist believed a psycho like Tom and thought the father was a molester.  I am utterly flabbergasted at how inane these people are, just letting the maniac go crazy with anything he touches.I cannot stand the jokes in this movie, their vulgarity is matched by how irrelevant they are.  There's no meaning for him acting so immature and repulsive, and he can go too far with his material.  Specially it's the child abuse jokes that tear my funny bone into two: there's a recurrence where a nice suburban kid gets physical hit whenever Tom is around.  Now I'm not against child abuse in comedies,they can be funny at times, but they have to be wholesome and treated in good fun (plus the child had to be a brat to deserve such slapstick); when this innocent kid gets hurt, he's bleeding and crying.  What's so funny about that?  That's just depressing, it's cruel, mean, and sickening.In fact, ""Freddy Got Fingered"" is entirely sick.  This is an insult to even controversial comedy, because even certain controversial shows and movies make a point.  They don't try to shock the audience for their own sake, and this movie has no purpose in being so horribly depicted.  It's an unsatisfying, unwanted abomination that caters to the garbage where it should be.",1,When Will The Suffering Stop?,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,4229,"['Tom', 'Green', 'aspiring', 'cartoonist', 'who', 'traveled', 'California', 'try', 'selling', 'work', 'working', 'cheese', 'factory', 'failed', 'sell', 'pitch', 'animation', 'mogul', 'mogul', 'gave', 'advice', 'follow', 'animals', 'drawings', 'thinking', 'so', 'can', 'make', 'better', 'pitch', 'next', 'time', 'movie', 'really', 'nasty', 'incomprehensible', 'here.When', 'Canadians', 'media', 'wanted', 'make', 'something', 'gross', 'theyusuallydeliver', 'Tom', 'Green', 'showed', 'kind', 'what', 'being', 'gross', 'aboot', 'outdid', 'most', 'rancid', 'loud', 'offensive', 'indecent', 'way', 'possible', 'had', 'suffer', 'consequence', 'yet', 'such', 'beatdown', ""'m"", 'give', 'Freddy', 'Got', 'Fingered', 'was', 'sadly', 'time', 'once', 'Tom', 'Green', 'mental', 'antics', 'was', 'days', 'thought', 'wearing', 'red', 'NY', 'cap', 'backwards', 'was', 'cool', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'easy', 'was', 'laugh', 'anything', 'Tom', 'Green', 'Show', 'had', 'offer', 'even', 'cancer', 'special', 'Bum', 'Bum', 'song', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'guy', 'firm', 'restraints', 'not', 'push', 'FCC', 'limits', 'still', 'be', 'wild', 'enough', 'chalk', 'anything', 'Watching', 'take', 'director', 'seat', 'feature-length', 'film', 'things', 'are', 'best', 'left', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'story-driven', 'film', 'Tom', 'meets', 'animation', 'mogul', 'think', 'premise', ""'be"", 'animal', 'would', 'be', 'serviceable', 'enoughfor', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'movie', 'nope', 'Tom', 'Green', 'disregard', 'plot', 'have', 'entire', 'movie', 'be', 'series', 'unused', 'sketches', 'old', 'show.Bud', 'Doylegot', 'nothing', 'how', 'reprehensibly', 'destructive', 'Tom', 'Green', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'Whenever', 'not', 'causing', 'harm', 'towards', 'others', 'express', 'motions', 'retarded', 'gesture', 'making', 'conflict', 'vindictive', 'father', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'simply', 'TOMfoolery', 'bathroom', 'making', 'sausages', 'tied', 'piano', 'wanted', 'sympathize', 'father', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'rude', 'abrasive', 'son', 'what', 'bizarre', 'can', 'easily', 'forgive', 'Tom', 'everything', 'just', 'having', 'job', 'relationship', 'so', 'destructive', 'uncanny', 'make', 'Bam', 'Margera', 'father', 'look', 'Mormons.Tom', 'character', 'actions', 'are', 'uncalled', 'monstrosity', 'objects', 'horses', 'elephants', 'threatened', 'use', 'gun', 'cut', 'up', 'deer', 'carcass', 'wear', 'disguise', 'only', 'be', 'hit', 'truck', 'survive', 'sadly', 'enough', 'chewed', 'up', 'umbilical', 'cord', 'spaghetti', 'used', 'newborn', 'baby', 'lasso', 'not', 'only', 'crazy', 'dangerous', 'disturbed', 'human', 'being', 'be', 'psychologically', 'evaluated', 'be', 'lobotomized', 'certainly', 'not', 'people', 'movie', 'side', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'not', 'acknowledging', 'behavior', 'tolerating', 'best', 'friend', 'abused', 'yet', 'friend', 'still', 'get', 'wheelchair-bound', 'woman', 'strange', 'masochistic', 'attitude', 'who', 'supported', 'mother', ""n't"", 'understand', 'reason', 'family', 'psychologist', 'believed', 'psycho', 'Tom', 'thought', 'father', 'was', 'molester', 'am', 'utterly', 'flabbergasted', 'how', 'inane', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'letting', 'maniac', 'go', 'crazy', 'anything', 'touches.I', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'jokes', 'movie', 'vulgarity', 'matched', 'how', 'irrelevant', 'are', 'meaning', 'acting', 'so', 'immature', 'repulsive', 'can', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'material', 'Specially', 'child', 'abuse', 'jokes', 'tear', 'funny', 'bone', 'two', 'recurrence', 'where', 'nice', 'suburban', 'kid', 'physical', 'hit', 'whenever', 'Tom', 'around', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'child', 'abuse', 'comedies', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'times', 'have', 'be', 'wholesome', 'treated', 'good', 'fun', 'child', 'had', 'be', 'brat', 'deserve', 'such', 'slapstick', 'when', 'innocent', 'kid', 'hurt', 'bleeding', 'crying', 'What', 'so', 'funny', 'just', 'depressing', 'cruel', 'mean', 'sickening.In', 'fact', 'Freddy', 'Got', 'Fingered', 'entirely', 'sick', 'insult', 'even', 'controversial', 'comedy', 'even', 'certain', 'controversial', 'shows', 'movies', 'make', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'shock', 'audience', 'own', 'sake', 'movie', 'purpose', 'being', 'so', 'horribly', 'depicted', 'unsatisfying', 'unwanted', 'abomination', 'garbage', 'where', 'should', 'be']",Freddy Got Fingered

I was appalled whenI am absolutely baffled, not to mention appalled, at the large number of people who actually like this (edited for inappropriate language) and giving it favorable reviews. This is a testament to just how mentally arrested much of society seems to have become in recent years in terms of taste for entertainment. There are many extremely disturbing and horrifying scenes that just completely destroy all of the worthiness of this abominable film. To put it plain and simple, there isn't even an atom of redeeming value anywhere on here. All of us have plenty of freak in ourselves. ""FGF"" has none of that. This movie is just plain sick, perverted, and stupid to a dangerous level.How is it funny when a stillborn is spun around in the air with an umbilical cord in a hospital room and then given back to the mother and laughing about it?! How is it supposed to be funny seeing animal (gratification) funny?! How is any of this funny? Anyone with even a small piece of brain tissue would be smart enough to not even find this remotely funny. I would've even go far enough as to say that this is racist and bigoted!There are plenty of dumb movies out there that can still be plenty of fun and humorous without necessarily being intelligent. ""Freddy Got Fingered"" does not fall into either category. In fact, I am absolutely confused that this hasn't gotten an NC-17 rating as the content that is prevalent throughout warrants this being that rating and far more than an R rated flick. This should've even been categorized in the adult movie section at a run down video store. I would even go the distance to say that it almost seems to be more like illegal video material that would get one in major trouble with the law.Don't even bother to rent this cinematic garbage. There isn't anything shocking about it at all. It's just an embarrassing and ignominious piece of garbage that just simply should be taken off the market altogether. It will do nothing but indelibly leave negatively disturbing images in your mind and leave bad mental scars for many years to come. Thankfully though, I managed to psychologically recover from the scars of this wretched movie and rebound a strong person. It's a shame that Green hasn't done the same. He is like 25 years too old to be acting like a leprechaun with rabies.

It's definitely a dated movie and is definitely not as good as some people seem to think it is, I liked Tom Green but to be brutally honest his comedy is nothing special and if you compare it to the kind of stuff that's around nowadays it just becomes mediocre.What I liked most about this movie were the characters, Tom does a good job as gord, and the people who play his brother and mom are also pretty good. His father is the absolute best and the conflicting chemistry between them does a good job of moving the story along. The girl who plays his paralyzed girlfriend is also pretty good, though I would have liked to have seen more of her. The comedy is the most conflicting thing about it for me, some of the jokes are genuinely funny but alot of it comes off as being forced and tries more to shock you or gross you out than to actually be funny.Bottom line, the movie is OK, it's not bad but it's not too good either and it can be a little boring sometimes.

Both films were funny. Both tackled the issue of sex head on. Both ended with an exchange of bodily fluids, ironically more explicit in Green's film.

I suspect there are a lot of wannabe's out there still living at home who were made uncomfortable by Green's mirror. So they looked away and blamed the comedy. It's not classic but there are belly laughs. It's just some of the material inbetween that makes you go ""what?""

His delivery is all wrong, as if the contraints of his own screenplay and direction wrung the humor from him.His physical comedy is spastic and random and go and on. He fumbles around with humor like an orangutang with a bra-strap. Rip Torn as Green's father is equally inept.For a screenplay that has little contextual humor, delivery is everything, and the performers are tone-deaf. Consider the scene where Rip Torn drunkenly bares his arse and invites Gord (Green) to ""f*ck your daddy."" That's the driving comedic force behind this bit. I wonder if Green wrote the screenplay as an act of comedic procrastination, thinking ""we figure out how to make this scene funny while we do it."" As if humor was special effects.Bad as it was, I had a hard time abhorring this. I was ready to be offended by the baby swinging scene, but was instead just bored. There's an ongoing gag about an accident-prone little boy that's handled too graphically to be funny and ends up being uncomfortable, but that's about it.No, It's not worse than TOMCATS.

I think the critics missed the point on this one...it was intended to be marvellously stupid. Nothing made me happier to find that Tom Green was still hitting the mark in my books. Basically a story of a lazy, good-for-nothing kid trying to make a living as a cartoonist while simultaneously trying to live up to his dad's expectations is about the only way to describe this flick. From there it just descends into an anarchic free for all whose only intention is too make you laugh at the absurdity of it's premise. Watch as Tom helps a woman give birth and commence to bite the umbilical cord and swing the baby by the same cord to bring it to life. See Tom bring a lady to climax by wacking on her paralyzed legs with bamboo. Observe as Tom scuba dives in his shower. Laugh as his younger neighbour always gets in the path of flying objects. Somehow, Mr. Green ties all this together into some barely cohesive story. I just laughed harder and harder as the film progressed. He continually tops himself with every scene. Rip Torn is awesome as his abusive, taunting, world-weary father. Rip was always awesome on 'The Larry Sanders Show', and this movies further cements his greatness in my mind. Anthony Michael Hall is nearly unrecognizable as a slick producer at some nameless cartoon company. It's nice to see him working again. I can't put into words how absurd and ridiculous this flick is. When Tom licks the bone jutting from his best friend's shin, I screamed in delight. When Tom freaks out on a fake cell phone in a restaurant, firing the fake person on the other line for costing him 'forty million deutschmarks' I giggled uproarously. When Tom tells his mom to leave his father and pursue sex encounters with basketball players and Greek men, I nearly died. When he fondles a stud horse, I did die and go to heaven. I've given away quite a bit, but believe me, when you see it, you will STILL laugh! I wish every Hollywood comedy was this good! I hate the generic crime film within a comedy scenario. This is what filmmaking is about. The critics just lambasted it, but that's only because they're jealous that someone gave Mr. Green the money to make a movie like this, while they just continue to write reviews nobody reads.

I, personally think it is absolutely the funniest thing I've ever seen, but some people think Tom Green's sick humor is too much.  Now, he can be a little ridiculous at times, but this movie was simply great.  I mean come on, someone running around a forest road screeming and wearing a dead deer on their back while cute little forest animals spectate nearby and children's music plays in the background, and then to have him plowed by a speeding eighteen wheeler and go scraping across the ground at 60 mph?  HOW IS THAT NOT FUNNY? Fans of the Tom Green Show will treasure this movie.  The exaggerated situations and the spontaneous ridicule at unpredictable places just made the movie.  I mean, it's just the kind of movie I'm looking for, nothing but comedy, from the beginning to the end.

670457,A17E28QEX42YU0,B00005NTOH,"Jason ""Hastaj00""","[7, 11]","I remember not being impressed seeing 'Freddy Got Fingered' back in 2001 when it was released in theatres - now close to a half-decade ago - but I also remember thinking ""that wasn't NEARLY as bad as all those reviewers said it was"". That opinion pretty much held up the other night, when I watched it for the first time since that initial viewing.Without any question in my mind, the real reason to see 'Freddy' is for Rip Torn's performance as Green's father. His comedic expressions are, literally, gold, and being the realistic, angry counter-force to Green's manically cartoonish imbecile makes his emotional clouds of rage that much more hilarious. For example, Green is in the shower, unknowingly in scuba gear to his father. Like most of the events in the film, it begins with Torn playing it sincere, as if the situation were normal. In this particular scene he kindly jokes around, doing some trick to make the water in the shower hot to play with Green. When there is no reaction by Green, it quickly cuts to a brilliant shot of Torn seethingly kicking open the door to the bathroom. He then opens the shower, and sees Green in the scuba gear. His basic reaction to situations like this are almost always the same, but Torn plays them so perfectly, with hysterical nuance, that the scheme never gets old. Again, by playing the ""what the $*#@ are you doing?"" contrast to the absurdity of Green makes the situations that much funnier, and Green knows this as a director, and edits those particular scenes wonderfully, which presents some of the most funny, original comedic scenes I've seen in recent years. And, despite Torn's talented subtleties, they play off the situations to the most extreme effect; in the scuba scene, when Torn asks Green what the *%#)@ he's doing, Green gives him some moronic line about the soap being a treasure. Contrasting this absurd behavior, then, is Torn, who violently, ruthlessly throws Green out of the shower on to the floor, breaking the glass of the shower entirely. I think this dynamic works so well because Torn is one of those old-fashioned guys, impulsive and ready to act on his heated emotions, so naturally he abuses Green in a way that most of us are too passive-aggressive to go about doing.Probably the other most successful element of the film, for me, is the musical score. It's basically one simple theme, awesomely satirical in its overt melodrama, that takes advantage of the underlying, ridiculous film it's paired up with. Somehow, it just gels the whole thing together, and in my opinion, gives a lot of the film's bits a sense of humor that they'd lack had its presence been missing.Overall, though, the movie isn't anything truly special, and while I really do believe it's got moments of genius, there are just as many scenes that flop. Yet, I must say not once did I find myself bored or distracted, and I think that's because the sheer distinctness of 'Freddy' is utterly refreshing when such Hollywood RUBBISH, most which have the balls to call themselves 'comedies', are thrown at us. Green goes all out and does his own thing, and if you don't like it, you don't like it. If you do, you do. Though it's certainly not my favorite film of all time, if the debate ever comes up in some sort of social interaction, I'll stubbornly defend the 'thumbs up' stance, if only for the greater elements 'Freddy' does possess.",3,Unfairly dumped on,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,3389,"['remember', 'not', 'being', 'impressed', 'seeing', ""'Freddy"", 'Got', 'Fingered', 'back', '2001', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'now', 'close', 'half-decade', 'also', 'remember', 'thinking', 'was', ""n't"", 'NEARLY', 'as', 'bad', 'reviewers', 'said', 'was', 'opinion', 'pretty', 'much', 'held', 'up', 'other', 'night', 'when', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'initial', 'question', 'mind', 'real', 'reason', 'see', ""'Freddy"", 'Rip', 'Torn', 'performance', 'Green', 'father', 'comedic', 'expressions', 'are', 'literally', 'gold', 'being', 'realistic', 'angry', 'counter-force', 'Green', 'manically', 'cartoonish', 'imbecile', 'emotional', 'clouds', 'rage', 'much', 'more', 'hilarious', 'example', 'Green', 'shower', 'unknowingly', 'scuba', 'gear', 'father', 'most', 'events', 'film', 'Torn', 'playing', 'sincere', 'situation', 'were', 'normal', 'particular', 'scene', 'kindly', 'around', 'doing', 'trick', 'make', 'water', 'shower', 'hot', 'play', 'Green', 'When', 'reaction', 'Green', 'quickly', 'brilliant', 'shot', 'Torn', 'seethingly', 'kicking', 'open', 'door', 'bathroom', 'then', 'shower', 'sees', 'Green', 'scuba', 'gear', 'basic', 'reaction', 'situations', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'same', 'Torn', 'so', 'perfectly', 'hysterical', 'nuance', 'scheme', 'never', 'old', 'Again', 'playing', 'what', '*', '@', 'are', 'doing', 'contrast', 'absurdity', 'Green', 'situations', 'much', 'funnier', 'Green', 'director', 'edits', 'particular', 'scenes', 'wonderfully', 'most', 'funny', 'original', 'comedic', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'Torn', 'talented', 'subtleties', 'play', 'off', 'situations', 'most', 'extreme', 'effect', 'scuba', 'scene', 'when', 'Torn', 'Green', 'what', '*', '%', 'doing', 'Green', 'moronic', 'line', 'soap', 'being', 'treasure', 'Contrasting', 'absurd', 'behavior', 'then', 'Torn', 'who', 'violently', 'ruthlessly', 'Green', 'shower', 'floor', 'breaking', 'glass', 'shower', 'entirely', 'think', 'dynamic', 'so', 'well', 'Torn', 'one', 'old-fashioned', 'guys', 'impulsive', 'ready', 'act', 'heated', 'emotions', 'so', 'naturally', 'Green', 'way', 'most', 'are', 'too', 'passive-aggressive', 'go', 'doing.Probably', 'other', 'most', 'successful', 'element', 'film', 'musical', 'score', 'basically', 'one', 'simple', 'theme', 'awesomely', 'satirical', 'overt', 'melodrama', 'advantage', 'underlying', 'ridiculous', 'film', 'paired', 'up', 'Somehow', 'just', 'gels', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'opinion', 'lot', 'film', 'bits', 'sense', 'humor', ""'d"", 'lack', 'had', 'presence', 'been', 'missing.Overall', 'though', 'movie', ""n't"", 'anything', 'truly', 'special', 'really', 'do', 'believe', 'got', 'moments', 'genius', 'are', 'just', 'many', 'scenes', 'flop', 'must', 'say', 'not', 'once', 'did', 'find', 'bored', 'distracted', 'think', 'sheer', 'distinctness', ""'Freddy"", 'utterly', 'refreshing', 'when', 'such', 'Hollywood', 'RUBBISH', 'most', 'have', 'balls', 'call', ""'comedies"", 'are', 'thrown', 'Green', 'out', 'own', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', 'do', 'certainly', 'not', 'favorite', 'film', 'time', 'debate', 'ever', 'up', 'sort', 'social', 'interaction', ""'ll"", 'stubbornly', 'defend', ""'thumbs"", 'up', 'stance', 'only', 'greater', 'elements', 'possess']",Freddy Got Fingered

670494,AQBHNE9AP6YBP,B00005NTOH,NostalgiaVHS,"[0, 1]","Out of every comedian and tv personality that has come and gone through the years, few managed to be so polarizing to audiences as Tom Green. His signature brand of weirdo, gross-out humor certainly doesn't conform to the general population's idea of what funny is, especially when its pushed to the furthest extreme imaginable as it is in Freddy Got Fingered.For some background, Tom Green hosted his own show from 1994 to 1998 in Canada then moved to MTV sometime around 1999 and achieved what some might call fame. His show was successful because of its wacky content and hidden camera segments. Green won a cult following by acting like a total idiot out on the streets and filming the reactions of unknowing strangers. This reality style format served him well as it was a perfect showcase for his quick wit and zany personality.This brings me to the overall issue plaguing Freddy Got Fingered, the fact that its a fictional film. Tom Green is not a good comedy actor, and he doesn't know how to write good jokes for movies. As a result there are jokes in the movie that are inspired by Tom Green's classic gross-out schtick, such as grabbing a horse's member, but the humor is lost because its scripted and not spontaneous. Tom Green didn't understand what made his brand of humor work, so to me the movie is almost something like a missed opportunity. The Jackass team did not make the same mistake when they made their movie. Instead of making it fictional they formatted it like a full length version of the show. Tom Green should've done the same.That's not to say that the film is completely without humor. There are many funny moments in the film, mainly due to Green's awkward man-boyness and general wackiness when compared to his uptight parents. Rip Torn does a great job playing Tom's dad. He really gives everything into his performance and is willing to do things I honestly wouldn't have expected an actor of his caliber to do. It's definitely a unique role in his career.Like most gross-out comedies the humor in this film is mostly immature and offensive. I personally am a fan of this type of humor, and Tom Green is definitely a master at it, but to be truthful his brand of comedy is not for everyone.

There is no method to his madness. Just random acts of stupidity that reeks of a desperation to get laughs. Im amazed that Tom Green even has fans after seeing this turdfest.  Tom doesnt just scrape the bottom of the barrel when it comes to getting laughs, he breaks through the bottom of the barrel scraping the ground the barrel is on to get laughs. And he still fails!!! Tom Green is so pathetic at getting you to laugh in this movie that it comes off as mere desperation. What's so funny about yanking a horse's third leg? What so funny about licking a guy's bleeding pertruding leg fracture after he busted his butt trying to skateboard with dress shoes on? What's so funny about an attractive handicapped young women that gets off on getting whacked with a stick on her leg or this same pretty woman begging this ugly dillhole known as Tom Green to let her give him skull? What's so funny about cutting open a deer's insides and wearing this skin of this deer on his head right before he gets hit by an oncoming semi truck? What so funny about Rip Torn bearing his naked butt in front of his one while Eric B & Rakim's Microphone Fiend plays in the background? Do you find Tom Green yanking off an elephant only to splash elephant semen on his father and get kicked by the same elephant? Is watching a baby get swung around by it's umbilical cord while splattering blood on some Indian women beating tambourines funny to you? Does watching a guy gnaw off an umbilical cord come off as humorous to you? If you find any of what I just wrote funny you'll love this tripe. If not then stay far away from this garbage as humanly possible. This movie is dumb. Dude, Where's My Car dumb and the script looked like it was written by some kooky middle schoolers.

After all, no film can be as bad as that, huh? There were moments of clarity and genuine sincerity in films like Glitter and Gigli, as well as those films of Ed Wood. Freddy Got Fingered offered a few sensitive moments by Julie Hagerty (a devoted mom) and Eddie Kaye Thomas (an abused sibling, but not what you think). Otherwise, Tom Green's ego trip as star, writer & director has little to offer, esecially in the ""laffs"" department. I enjoy clever, crude scenarios (Airplane!, anyone?). This film is no Airplane! or even American Pie. A few references to Green's penchant for creative behavior might've been better than the long, drawn-out gross-out set pieces. Drew Barrymore (his squeeze at the time) and the great Rip Torn reached new lows, though you can't say they didn't take their roles to the max. And that's the problem...Green's excess simply wasn't funny or clever. I thought the title was a metaphor but there's a suggestion that Freddy really did get...well, you know.

670508,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00005NTOH,Robert I. Hedges,"[3, 7]","It is for good reason that the ""Chicago Sun Times"" called this film ""a vomitorium."" ""Freddy Got Fingered"" is the most tasteless movie I have ever seen. I thought about giving this film two stars, as a couple of bright spots do present themselves underneath the films execrable veneer, but on balance I couldn't bring myself to do it. The film centers around Tom Green's desire to become an animator in Los Angeles, and his conflicts with his father, Rip Torn. Torn and Anthony Michael Hall provide most of the (few) laughs to be had, although there were three other brief bright points in the film. The animation called ""Zebras in America"" was stupid yet amusing (""Listen To My Hooves!""); I will never think of half human-half zebra mythical animals the same way again. The sausage organ scene is one of the most musically odious performances I have ever seen, yet Green's singing made it worthwhile as a touchstone for horrible film scores. Finally, the surprise trip to Pakistan for Green and Torn was a quirky and unexpected turn of events. Torn and Hall are the highlights of the film, as their straight man reaction shots are as good as acting can get in this mess. That's pretty much the good. The bad is much, much more extensive.The film wallows in adolescent self-indulgence, and serves as nothing more than a shock vehicle for Green. While this is no surprise, the depths to which he will plunge (the ""New York Times"" called him an ""artist"" for making this film...) is an unwelcome surprise. I certainly could have done without the baby delivery scene (it's worse than you can possible imagine), I never needed to see Rip Torn's rear end in a provocative dance scene, nor did I need the extremely adolescent phallic obsessions manifested with both a horse and an elephant. Just when you think it couldn't possibly get worse Julie Hagerty (What was she thinking?), Green's mother, turns up in bed with Shaquille O'Neal. I was especially unamused with the handicapped girlfriend, Marisa Coughlan (somehow this movie failed to catapult her to stardom) and her ventures as an ""amateur rocket scientist,"" although that was by far not the most annoying aspect of her character, which I suspect was developed strictly from Green's oversized ego. You'll understand when you see the film, believe me: the world ""subtlety"" does not exist in Tom Green's vocabulary.The DVD features numerous extras, but the real question is, will you be able to stand watching them? The only one worth anything is Rip Torn's scene-specific commentary track. Tom Green's approach to commentary tracks is stylistically similar to Ray Dennis Steckler's, the exception being that Steckler provides useful information and insight along with narration. Green merely likes to hear himself talk, and provokes the audience to like him even less (if that's possible). There is a track of the audience reaction at the premiere, which is a novel innovation. It's pretty boring in practice, though, as you hear laughs here and there, and a lot of groans at mayhem involving Green with roadkill, Green treating an open leg wound, Green delivering a baby, and green massaging various large mammals in an impure manner.I do not recommend this movie for human beings.",1,"""You Can't Hurt Me!

These shamelessly pandered to their braindead teenage audience to get laughs for, amongst other things, a dog's shrinking testes. Ha. Ha.This, though, is a review of ""Freddy Got Fingered."" So let's begin. In order to understand whether a movie is successful, it's important to take its goals into consideration. The point of this movie was, obviously, to push boundaries and be outrageously funny, and, yes, gross. It was an actually disgusting gross-out comedy, something that rarely gets made. So it was unfair for whoever reviewed this to expect anything else. When one gives the movie a fair shake and watches it with said goals in mind, it's actually very good and funny. The plot is more engrossing and quirky than most cookie-cutter comedies, in addition to serving as a springboard for Tom Green's comic mayhem, which is admittedly hit-or-miss here, (I could have done without seeing him run around a highway with a deer's carcas draped on his back before getting hit by a truck)but does hit most of the time.

It took the fears of hundreds of high-school grads and college dropouts...  Then had the nerve to laugh at them and make them look like mental cases.This film's worst crime is that it tries to be about something.  Tom Green plays a general miscreant who, at 28, still lives at home, though he dreams of being an animator.  This premise could have been a showcase for Green's bizarre sense of humor, with him front and center.  Instead, the limelight is shared with his father, played by Rip Torn.  What results is ninety-plus minutes of arguing, with Green constantly mugging, and Torn constantly overacting.  Subplots are provided with Green's little brother Freddy, and his girlfriend.  Those, however, are respectively non-existant, and entirely cliched.I can see where this film may have been a fascinating descent into an off-kilter mind.  With a much better script and the same premise, Green's twisted antics may have had some meaning.  That film is currently nowhere to be seen, though.It could also have been a simple excuse, there merely to display Green to a wider audience, much like the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; movies.

He wanted to be the guy that turned heads with sick scenes, and a ridiculous plot.Now that I've gotten THAT out of the way, I'll review the film itself.Most movies considered ""cult films"" failed to achieve mainstream success upon original theatrical release, often grossing more money in video rentals and sales than in theater tickets. In most cases (but by no means all), the film hardly makes an impression with the general public and critics are often apathetic as well. However, a small, devoted group of viewers, often ""film buffs"" or film students, show an extreme appreciation of the film.Tom Green has really outdone himself with this masterpiece of cinematic art,never in all the history of movie making has any actor/writer even come close with creating a movie so disturbingly crude and yet equally amusing at the same time. The Farrely brothers must be biting their lips in envy at Tom Green, for even they could not have created a movie as over the top as Freddy Got Fingered, and believe me labeling this movie ""over the top"" is an understatement of the highest degree. Anyway, to make a long story short...GO SEE THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS! At least Tom tried, that's all that can be said.I give the movie a very enthusiastic 10 out of 10.",5,A future cult classic!,1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,1346,"['Major', 'props', 'Tom', 'Green', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'took', 'different', 'route', 'directional', 'debut', 'wanted', 'be', 'guy', 'turned', 'heads', 'sick', 'scenes', 'ridiculous', 'plot.Now', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'way', ""'ll"", 'review', 'film', 'itself.Most', 'movies', 'considered', 'cult', 'films', 'failed', 'achieve', 'mainstream', 'success', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'often', 'grossing', 'more', 'money', 'video', 'rentals', 'sales', 'theater', 'tickets', 'most', 'cases', 'means', 'film', 'hardly', 'impression', 'general', 'public', 'critics', 'are', 'often', 'apathetic', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'small', 'devoted', 'group', 'viewers', 'often', 'film', 'buffs', 'film', 'students', 'show', 'extreme', 'appreciation', 'film.Tom', 'Green', 'really', 'outdone', 'masterpiece', 'cinematic', 'art', 'never', 'history', 'movie', 'making', 'actor/writer', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'creating', 'movie', 'so', 'disturbingly', 'crude', 'yet', 'equally', 'amusing', 'same', 'time', 'Farrely', 'brothers', 'must', 'be', 'biting', 'lips', 'envy', 'Tom', 'Green', 'even', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'created', 'movie', 'top', 'Freddy', 'Got', 'Fingered', 'believe', 'labeling', 'movie', 'top', 'understatement', 'highest', 'degree', 'Anyway', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'GO', 'SEE', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'AT', 'ALL', 'COSTS', 'least', 'Tom', 'tried', 'can', 'be', 'said.I', 'give', 'movie', 'very', 'enthusiastic', '10', '10']",Freddy Got Fingered
