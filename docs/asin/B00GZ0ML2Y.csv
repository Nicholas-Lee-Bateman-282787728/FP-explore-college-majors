With his son in tow, Batman wages war against the villain Deathstroke (Gibson) and the League of Shadows, all while teaching his headstrong boy that one can't fight crime by becoming a criminal.

It's only time constraints that are keeping me from watch the whole thing.  I have loved this character since the Batman comics introduced him.  I know that in the comics he has been slain, very brutally, but I am glad DC is continuing his legacy in different media and stories.  He is a great character for the Batman and Alfred to play off of.  He is totally different than any previous Robin.  I bit of a braggart and rather cocky but that is what sets him aside from the other Robins.  He may not have the most friendly attitude but he is a trained fighter, thanks to his grandfather, Ras A Ghul.  He is the son of Bruce Wayne and Tashw Ghul daughter pf Ras.  A dalliance 13 and 1/2 years ago that led to the birth of Damian, something that Bruce Wayne did not know about until Tasha brought him to train with Bruce (She knows he is The Batman).

However, I was happy to find it was a quite enjoyable film, not perfect, but very fun to watch. Much better than the bowels of the DC Universe Animated Original Movies, such as &#34;Justice League: War&#34; (Jerky League: Why?) and &#34;Green Lantern: First Flight&#34; (dosen't get much worse than this).The animation was good, very similar to past ones. The action scenes were awesome, something DC has always been great at. The script I thought was fun. The story is drop dead amazing, but it's good enough, and the humor when it was at play certainly had me laughing (it's like &#34;The Dark Knight Returns: Part 1,&#34; a great and grim Batman movie...with good humor? 0_0). The voice acting I feel has normally been the most controversial aspect of the film. I'm tired of the Damian complaints, he sounds like his age! And David McCallum and Sean Maher do great jobs as portraying Alfred and Nightwing. Deathstroke, however, is not supposed to sound like con artist Darkseid, and Jason O'Mara is still a poor substitute for Kevin Conroy (then again, who's a good one?).If you completely ignored that last bit, here's a quick detailing of it all:- Animation: 4/5- Action: 4/5- Script/Story: 4/5- Voice Acting: 3/5And the only special feature i've watched so far was the &#34;Batman: Assault on Arkham&#34; preview, which looks awesome. Same animation, whatever, but Arkhamverse prescence, good-looking story, and Kevin Conroy as Batman = WA-HOO!So, overall, 4/5.

1682833,A3CPJYAQMCUGNR,B00GZ0ML2Y,Chris Matthews,"[18, 669]","During the harsh winter months up in North Dakota, the amount of after school activities was always limited.  The Boys Club I would frequent burned down from a fire in the kitchen started by a couple sleeping Polish men (on ""working"" visa) at the grill. Most of the time, when I got off the school bus to go home, the door would be locked. My aunt thought she had a break in one time and became obsessed with making sure all the doors were locked.  The ""break in"" turned out to be a stray cat in heat knocking over some of her Precious Moments figurines while trying to mate with them. My uncle had confided with me that disgraceful event saying that he just sat there and watched the entire show with his mirrored sunglasses on while slowly drinking his six pack of beer. He hated those figurines more than cats which made the show all the more enjoyable.As for getting into the house, frequently I would simply have to wait until she woke up from her daily drinking game with game shows. It was a race against daylight due to the short hours of sunlight in the winter.  If I lost that race, I would end up sleeping on the backseat of the Buick with a camping blanket for the night.  My uncle would work late nights with his security job at the alternative lifestyle male truckers dance club. He would go drinking afterwards if he hadn't had enough while at work.My afterschool activities took a turn for the better when the local chapter of NAMBLA got together and rebuilt the Boys Club. It was a sizable upgrade from the facility that resided there previously. Indoor swimming pool, water slides, recreational courts, weight room, media/game room, showers, juice bar and even sleeping quarters for the weary fitness fanatic.It was there that I met Dave who was a wealthy and elusive man who befriended me during those cold winter months.  We seemed to just connect from the time we first met while I was watching some movie action movie on VHS. From there on, we spent a great deal of time together. We had some exciting black luxury van rides around town as we pretended to look for bad guys. In my own way, I felt like we were Batman and Robin.

1682838,A2ZG8JZNJI2F0N,B00GZ0ML2Y,Dante,"[0, 0]","I really looked forward to this film for a long time. Then I saw it. And it hurts me to leave this review.Damian Wayne is both my favorite Robin as well as one of my favorite characters in the DC Universe - which is something remarkable since I borderline hated his character when he was introduced (in my book, the ""surprise offspring"" plotline is what writers do when they're running out of ideas). But he soon grew to be the very reason I got into reading Batman comics again.The first moment I knew the film was going to have major problems was when they released a ""sneak peek"" of the movie and revealed that the creators of the film were going with the ""Talia drugged Batman"" version of events. This made me downright angry, as this version of events was something writer Grant Morrison himself openly admitted was a screw-up on his part quite some time ago, due to relying on shaky memories he had of ""Son of the Demon"" and not bothering to re-read the material before writing ""Batman and Son."" Source: ""For a long time, [DC] said [Son of the Demon] was out of continuity. Now it's just kind of out of continuity. I didn't actually read it before I started writing this. I messed up a lot of details, like Batman wasn't drugged when he was having sex with Talia and it didn't take place in the desert. I was relying on shaky memories. - Grant Morrison, Wizard #182 (p. 38). Furthermore, the New 52 has already established that Talia and Batman had a consensual relationship (to quote Bruce: ""Damian exists because I let my heart overrule my head"" (Batman and Robin Vol. 1). Why the film chose to go with an established mistake from the pre-52 universe (and meant this to be a New 52 movie) is beyond me, and I don't know why viewers are expected to overlook what basically equates to date rape.Damian's appeal is his stark contrast to his father - Damian is an anti-hero, relentlessly trained to kill since he was a young child. He is brutal and angry, and that is part of his charm - especially when he actively decides to overcome his past to follow in his father's footsteps. The film skims over Damian's harsh upbringing and presents what I can really only describe as a watered-down version of the character. As a fan of Peter Tomasi's work in Batman and Robin, I do enjoy Damian's calmer, more controlled self, but he did not start out that way. That being said, this version of Damian is not unlikable, but a little underwhelming to those who know him and his long journey to changing from the comics.A short list of other shortcomings in the film:-Deathstroke is a wimp (and as much as I love Thomas Gibson, he did not excel as a voice actor - he has a very limited voice range, it basically sounds like Hotch quit the FBI and became Deathstroke).-The League of Assassins is also embarrassingly wimpy - when the film begins you get to see the fearsome League of Assassins practicing martial arts moves I would expect to see in a children's karate class in a strip mall. Not to mention they use arrow machine guns and trebuchets to defend against military choppers and machine guns. Really?-In the first few minutes of the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the White Ghost (Ra's son) was in the film - IMO this is an underused but great character - then left disappointed after he was killed off after less than a minute of screen time. Quite literally, this was me during that scene: ""Oh wow, the White Ghost is in this mov...never mind that, then.""-The heart of the film should have been in father/son bonding moments, which are sadly almost completely glossed over. There are a few heartfelt moments (namely Bruce reminiscing about his father taking him to the amusement park where he is now doing surveillance with Damian), but these are few and far in between.-Talia. I'll just say the animators were going for constant fan-service with her outfit, and she's downgraded from being the central villain in the comic to a damsel-in-distress role in the film.- Dick Grayson/Nightwing. While portrayed well, he does little in the movie aside from bickering with Damian for no real reason. Grayson serves as a stand-in for Tim Drake.-I'm not an expert on the Lazarus pit - but I was always under the impression it's dangerous to climb into one if you don't need rejuvenating/reviving. Yet Batman just jumps waist-deep into one.-Small detail that maybe just bugged me: Damian's green eyes. In the comics, he has his father's blue eyes, and indeed this is the first hint we got that he was Bruce's son.Some redeeming moments:-Decent animation-Seeing Damian in action, even with the differences from the comics he still has some of the classic charm-I have never been a fan of Grant Morrison's writing, and I always did feel he introduced Damian too rushed and too briefly in ""Batman and Son."" It was nice to see an alternative version of events where Damian isn't rushed away after a handful of issues.",2,So Underwhelmed...,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,4924,"['really', 'looked', 'forward',

Normally I enjoy a lot of their work, but this movie was sorely lacking on almost every level. Both the characterization and acting was bad, the characters being distorted (with the exception of Damian) from the versions we are familiar with. Deathstroke is awkwardly shoehorned into the plot and becomes a cardboard cutout straw man villain, not even remotely close to his character from the comic books. Forget about watching this if you aren't already familiar with the long history between Ra's Al Ghul, Talia and Batman (the comic book versions); this movie assumes you are, and does nothing to fill in their backstory for viewers who aren't.Even the animation (except for some CGI stuff) is bland, and the character design is mediocre and boring; nothing like the old days of stylish Bruce Timm/Lynne Naylor character design, or when DC's movies attempted to mimic the style of the artist from the comic story on which the movie was based. Now it just looks ho-hum, like the worst of Marvel's DTV animated features. Might be just a notch above what they used for THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX animated feature, but that's not saying much.The preview feature for the next upcoming Batman animated feature looks even more appallingly bad, if that's possible. I was hoping for a totally CGI-animated feature, since the film is supposed to be set in the continuity of the ARKHAM ASYLUM/ARKHAM CITY video games. Why couldn't they just have made it look like the cut scenes from the game? Nor, from what I can glean, does it look like the plot of the story (other than being set in Arkham and featuring a bunch of Batman's rogues gallery of foes) has anything to do with the storyline of the game universe. It looks more like a story based on DC ""New 52"" version of the Suicide Squad (although Amanda Waller is still a middle-aged overweight woman in this one). They even admit that Batman does not even appear until halfway into the movie, so the story becomes more of a villains-versus-villains plot, with Batman almost as an afterthought. Oh, and the Arkham Asylum in the movie is an entire island prison, like Alcatraz, Ryker's or Blackgate Penitentiary.Soo-o-o-o, SO, disappointed in this. This will be the last DC DTV feature that I pre-order. In the future, I will wait until I actually see the DC DTV movies before purchasing, no matter how long that takes.

The real question everybody wanted to know the answer to was, &#34;How will a book written before the launch of the New 52 fit into the new cosmos?&#34; Whether you like the outcome or not, credit has to be given to DC for accomplishing the feat.When Ra's al Ghul is assassinated by Deathstroke and his army, his daughter Talia and her son Damian are left on the run for their lives. She takes the boy to the only place she knows he'll be safe: Gotham City and into the custody of the only man she can truly trust - The Batman. The Caped Crusader is caught off guard when he finds out he is the father of Damian. The heiress to the throne of the Demon leaves the 11-year-old under the wing of the Dark Knight. Batman soon finds himself partnered with a new Robin when he is put in the middle of a battle between Talia's new brigade of Man-Bats and Deathstroke's squad.If you've read Grant Morrison's graphic novel that &#34;Son of Batman&#34; is based on, then you know right off the bat (pun intended) this is not as faithful an adaptation as you might have expected. Whether or not you find this to be a good thing or bad is up to you. I personally found it to be entertaining and quite a brilliant way to pull the saga of &#34;Batman and Son&#34; into the New 52 world.&#34;Son of Batman&#34; is presented in 1080p High-Definition 16x9 (1.78:1) with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. Viewers will find the picture is vibrant and clean. The audio will encircle the audience with the bombastic sounds of explosions and atmospheric elements.The Blu-ray version of &#34;Batman and Son&#34; includes a satisfying amount of bonus material. It includes three featurettes entitled &#34;Strange Blood Ties: Damian Wayne,&#34; &#34;Designing the Characters with Phil Bourassa,&#34; and &#34;The Fang and the Demon Head: The League of Assassins.&#34; There's also a sneak peek at DC Universe's next animated movie, &#34;Batman: Arkham Assault.&#34; Four bonus cartoons from the DC Comics Vault top everything off.&#34;Batman and Son&#34; is rated PG-13 for Stylized violence including bloody images, and some suggestive material. There's more gore than usual as members of the League of Assassins and Deathstroke's army get stabbed and shot. Several lines of dialogue are rather racy, but most pre-teens probably won't get them. I still don't really know why they needed to be included. Why not just leave them out and know that the movie is safe for everyone without question?Some will see DC's use of Deathstroke to be a desperate ploy to promote and push the character further into the spotlight while cross-promoting his presence on &#34;Arrow.&#34; Hey, business is business. DC executives and writers gotta eat, too. I like the character on the television show and I like him in the comics. If you don't like him, then you're probably going to have a problem with his inclusion in &#34;Son of Batman.&#34;&#34;Son of Batman&#34; is made up of the first quarter of Morrison's book sans all the romantic elements and other extraneous elements which could be trimmed out. A little shuffling is done to certain plot elements and events, Deathstroke is thrown in, and &#34;Voila!&#34; We get an energetic and fast-paced 74-minute movie.",4,The Dark Knight deals with the dangers of fatherhood in 'Son of Batman',1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,3531,"['DC', 'Universe', 'combining', 'New', '52', 'Universe', 'animated', 'movie', 'universe', '34', 'Son', 'Batman.', '34', 'was', 'lot', 'easier', 'adapt', '34', 'Justice', 'League', 'War', '34', 'big', 'small', 'screen', 'given', 'was', 'already', 'rooted', 'rebooted', 'world', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'real', 'question', 'everybody', 'wanted', 'know', 'answer', 'was', '34', 'How', 'will', 'book', 'written', 'launch', 'New', '52', 'fit', 'new', 'cosmos', '34', 'Whether', 'outcome', 'not', 'credit', 'be', 'given', 'DC', 'accomplishing', 'feat.When', 'Ra', 'al', 'Ghul', 'assassinated', 'Deathstroke', 'army', 'daughter', 'Talia', 'son', 'Damian', 'are', 'left', 'run', 'lives', 'boy', 'only', 'place', ""'ll"", 'be', 'safe', 'Gotham', 'City', 'custody', 'only', 'man', 'can', 'truly', 'trust', 'Batman', 'Caped', 'Crusader', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'when', 'out', 'father', 'Damian', 'heiress', 'throne', 'Demon', '11-year-old', 'wing', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Batman', 'soon', 'partnered', 'new', 'Robin', 'when', 'put', 'middle', 'battle', 'Talia', 'new', 'brigade', 'Man-Bats', 'Deathstroke', 'squad.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Grant', 'Morrison', 'graphic', 'novel', '34', 'Son', 'Batman', '34', 'based', 'then', 'know', 'right', 'bat', 'pun', 'intended', 'not', 'as', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'Whether', 'not', 'find', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'bad', 'up', 'personally', 'found', 'be', 'entertaining', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'way', 'pull', 'saga', '34', 'Batman', 'Son', '34', 'New', '52', 'world.', '34', 'Son', 'Batman', '34', 'presented', '1080p', 'High-Definition', '16x9', '1.78:1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'Viewers', 'will', 'find', 'picture', 'vibrant', 'clean', 'audio', 'will', 'encircle', 'audience', 'bombastic', 'sounds', 'explosions', 'atmospheric', 'elements.The', 'Blu-ray', 'version', '34', 'Batman', 'Son', '34', 'satisfying', 'amount', 'bonus', 'material', 'three', 'featurettes', 'entitled', '34', 'Strange', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'Damian', 'Wayne', '34', '34', 'Designing', 'Characters', 'Phil', 'Bourassa', '34', '34', 'Fang', 'Demon', 'Head', 'League', 'Assassins.', '34', 'also', 'sneak', 'peek', 'DC', 'Universe', 'next', 'animated', 'movie', '34', 'Batman', 'Arkham', 'Assault.', '34', 'Four', 'bonus', 'cartoons', 'DC', 'Comics', 'Vault', 'top', 'everything', 'off.', '34', 'Batman', 'Son', '34', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'Stylized', 'violence', 'including', 'bloody', 'images', 'suggestive', 'material', 'more', 'gore', 'usual', 'members', 'League', 'Assassins', 'Deathstroke', 'army', 'get', 'stabbed', 'shot', 'Several', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'are', 'rather', 'racy', 'most', 'pre-teens', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'needed', 'be', 'included', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'leave', 'out', 'know', 'movie', 'safe', 'everyone', 'question', 'will', 'see', 'DC', 'use', 'Deathstroke', 'be', 'desperate', 'ploy', 'promote', 'push', 'character', 'further', 'spotlight', 'cross-promoting', 'presence', '34', 'Arrow.', '34', 'Hey', 'business', 'business', 'DC', 'executives', 'writers', 'got', 'ta', 'eat', 'too', 'character', 'television', 'show', 'like', 'comics', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'then', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'have', 'problem', 'inclusion', '34', 'Son', 'Batman.', '34', '34', 'Son', 'Batman', '34', 'made', 'first', 'quarter', 'Morrison', 'book', 'romantic', 'elements', 'other', 'extraneous', 'elements', 'could', 'be', 'trimmed', 'out', 'little', 'shuffling', 'done', 'certain', 'plot', 'elements', 'events', 'Deathstroke', 'thrown', '34', 'Voila', '34', 'get', 'energetic', 'fast-paced', '74-minute', 'movie']",DCU: Son of Batman (DVD)

1682853,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00GZ0ML2Y,FNDNreview,"[4, 9]","Damian Wayne is Robin &#8211; yes, as in Batman and Robin.  Who, you may ask, is Damian Wayne?  To the casual observers out there that pay little attention to Batman comic books, all you really need to know is that even Batman occasionally gets &#8220;down.&#8221;  The unnamed love child of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul was originally introduced during a 1987 graphic novel, Son of the Demon.  Flash forward nearly 10 years and infamous Batman writer, Grant Morrison, decided it was time for Batman to meet his son &#8211; in a storyline titled, Batman and Son.  And, just like that, Batman had another Robin at his side, which happens to be the subject of the new DC Universe animated original movie, Son of Batman.Ethan Spaulding directs Son of Batman, which stars the voices of Jason O&#8217;Mara as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Stuart Allan as Damian Wayne/Robin.  The story begins with an attack on Ra&#8217;s al Ghul&#8217;s (and his League of Assassins) palace by one of the league&#8217;s unruly former members, Slade Wilson/Deathstroke (Thomas Gibson).  Ultimately, the unforeseen ambush takes the life of Ra&#8217;s al Ghul, forcing his daughter, Talia (Morena Baccarin), to send Damian to Gotham City to live with his father, Batman &#8211; who has absolutely no idea that he has a son.Eventually, Deathstroke abducts both Talia and Kirk Langstrom (Xander Berkeley), and forces Langstrom to complete a secret project &#8211; of which both Batman and Damian take an interest in and begin investigating.  While Batman attempts to connect with his son, it&#8217;s abundantly clear that Damian has no respect for authority and spends his time full of rage &#8211; which inevitably pits Damian against the former Robin, Dick Grayson/Nightwing (Sean Mather).  Regardless, Batman, Robin, and Nightwing must find a way to work together and put an end to Deathstroke&#8217;s master plan.The actual comic book storyline was allotted plenty of time for depth and character development, and if you&#8217;ve been lucky enough to read it, then you&#8217;ll likely notice how hastily Son of Batman is adapted.  Like most cases, reading the source material is usually the best way to enjoy a particular story, because it&#8217;s abundantly clear that this animated feature doesn&#8217;t do the comic storyline proper justice.  However, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily take all the fun out of this feature film.  In fact, specific moments, like the showdown between Nightwing and Damian, make this feature an absolute treat to watch.In Son of Batman, Jason O&#8217;Mara is back for another stint as the dark knight, reprising his role from DC&#8217;s most recent animated release, Justice League: War.  Since O&#8217;Mara has again voiced Batman, one could easily assume that Son of Batman is taking place in DC&#8217;s New 52 animated universe.  Damian has played a pivotal role in the New 52 comic book universe, so it&#8217;s a no-brainer to finally give him the animated treatment.  In this film, his origin story is roughly the same, but like Jason Todd&#8217;s stint as Robin, Damian is now most famously known for his shocking death in the pages of Batman Inc.  It&#8217;s entirely possible that particular story could also receive the animated treatment in the not so distant future &#8211; since comic book fans seemingly love to watch their favorite characters take a dirt nap.For fans of Robin, it&#8217;s great to see him in a character-centric film, which is easily comparable to another Robin adventure, Batman:  Under the Red Hood.  Still, the villain of this particular story is a bit overshadowing &#8211; mainly because Deathstroke is not a typical Batman villain.  As of late, Deathstroke has been all over the expanded DC universe, playing a pivotal role in the Batman: Arkham Origins video game and on the popular TV show, Arrow.  Never the less, Deathstroke plays the role of the villain extremely well in Son of Batman &#8211; although his presence and ambitions are nearly identical to that of Bane in The Dark Knight Rises.If you ask serious Batman fans, they will tell you that the 1990s cartoon, Batman: The Animated Series will forever hold a special place in their hearts and is still regarded by countless Bat-followers as the greatest superhero cartoon, ever.  With that being said, the bloody visuals used within the recent animated comic book features are absolutely needless and completely unnecessary.  The storytelling is what sells fans on these movies, not the senseless bloodshed (or the occasional curse words).  Yes, there&#8217;s already plenty of violence, so why does the blood matter?  Well, it simply makes these new adventures unfriendly for young kids &#8211; and typically, cartoons cater to kids.  In fact, The Dark Knight trilogy is probably more suitable for kids than these gruesome animated flicks.Overall, Son of Batman is a dreaded mixed-bag adventure &#8211; largely due to too much happening in a short amount of time.  It would have been nice to see this film play out longer and take a greater in-depth approach to the relationship between Bruce and Damian, which clearly felt rushed and at times disingenuous.  However, there&#8217;s a lot to love about this film, also.  From start to finish, there&#8217;s near endless action (and bloodshed), not to mention several well-placed cameos of prominent Batman heroes and villains.  At the end of the day, Son of Batman is absolutely worth your time, but again, you should be cautioned before allowing the kids to see this graphic presentation.GRADE:  B-FNDNreview.com",4,Damian

1682859,AQIA5GSVGL75I,B00GZ0ML2Y,hoarselord,"[0, 0]","The movie was fun, a bit short like many animated Batman features, and lacked complexity of some of the other films.  It definitely was not on par in terms of style, content, complexity or overall artistry with The Dark Knight Returns, Doom, JL: Crisis on Two Earths, or the Green Lantern Animated Series.I agree with many other reviewers that the voice actor was the wrong choice for Batman and that the iconic Kevin Conroy voice is the best.  This voice actor's voice has an Adam Westish goofy twinge, old man warble to it.  I'm not saying it's a bad voice, just not the correct choice for the dark knight Batman.Spoiler below:Regarding the story, I didn't like the backstory that Batman was a rohypnol victim who was sort of date raped.  That was stupid.  Also, what is the motivation of Talia to 'rebuild the empire'.  Where does she get the money to do it if her 3 fortresses are destroyed and their mining operations also?  Does she offer a ninja assassin work study program / unpaid internship program or does she simply rohypnol them as well?  And if they are working for free, do they also build their own beds and farm their own vegan buffet offerings?  I think she'd have been better off marrying Bruce Wayne and then withholding sex until Batman buys her an army.  Sorry if that sounds like I'm saying something bad about women, I'm not: keep in mind she's a woman without scruples anyway, but as Batman is a flawed hero (driven by vengeance he can never quench because he blames the city for producing criminal elements that killed his parents), maybe it would work as a story.  As participants in a constantly-mutating, modern living myth, I think Batman fans can handle complexity of a Batman with controversial and questionable living arrangements, especially given we love the Dark Knight and his flaws.",5,"Interesting movie, Batman's voice and the ending is ishy",1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,1820,"['movie', 'was', 'fun', 'bit', 'short', 'many', 'animated', 'Batman', 'features', 'lacked', 'complexity', 'other', 'films', 'definitely', 'was', 'not', 'par', 'terms', 'style', 'content', 'complexity', 'overall', 'artistry', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'Doom', 'JL', 'Crisis', 'Two', 'Earths', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Animated', 'Series.I', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'voice', 'actor', 'was', 'wrong', 'choice', 'Batman', 'iconic', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'voice', 'best', 'voice', 'actor', 'voice', 'Adam', 'Westish', 'goofy', 'twinge', 'old', 'man', 'warble', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'voice', 'just', 'not', 'correct', 'choice', 'dark', 'knight', 'Batman.Spoiler', 'Regarding', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'backstory', 'Batman', 'was', 'rohypnol', 'victim', 'who', 'was', 'sort', 'date', 'raped', 'was', 'stupid', 'Also', 'what', 'motivation', 'Talia', ""'rebuild"", 'empire', 'Where', 'get', 'money', 'do', '3', 'fortresses', 'are', 'destroyed', 'mining', 'operations', 'also', 'offer', 'ninja', 'assassin', 'work', 'study', 'program', '/', 'unpaid', 'internship', 'program', 'simply', 'rohypnol', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'working', 'free', 'do', 'also', 'build', 'own', 'beds', 'farm', 'own', 'vegan', 'buffet', 'offerings', 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'marrying', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'then', 'withholding', 'sex', 'Batman', 'army', 'Sorry', ""'m"", 'saying', 'something', 'bad', 'women', ""'m"", 'not', 'keep', 'mind', 'woman', 'scruples', 'anyway', 'Batman', 'flawed', 'hero', 'driven', 'vengeance', 'can', 'never', 'quench', 'city', 'producing', 'criminal', 'elements', 'killed', 'parents', 'maybe', 'would', 'work', 'story', 'participants', 'constantly-mutating', 'modern', 'living', 'myth', 'think', 'Batman', 'fans', 'can', 'handle', 'complexity', 'Batman', 'controversial', 'questionable', 'living', 'arrangements', 'especially', 'given', 'love', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'flaws']",DCU: Son of Batman (DVD)

I'm pretty sure a lot of people want Kevin Conroy back and he is a good actor. Personally I think Jason Omara is a good batman, and he does deserve credit for being his own batman. Kevin Conroy doesn't have to do everything. My biggest complain is how choppy the story is, the dialogue doesn't convey things that I have seen in other movies. especially how hot headed Damian is, he should have had the crap beat out of him, and it is unbelievable that he could stand up to Deathstroke and his henchman, the one with the wolverine claws. He looked to young to have the strength which he was portrayed to have. i can understand skill, but age does have a lot to do with it. I couldn't invest in the movie because i lacked knowledge to the overall plot. It developed over time but I feel like the story writers should have flushed out some of the elements which could have improved the overall product.

1682861,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00GZ0ML2Y,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 0]","DC Animated used to be where fans of good animated long-form superhero adventures could go to get smart, well-told, well-acted, and well-animated storytelling. The key words there being &#34;used to&#34;. Ever since genius creator Bruce Timm left DC Animated, the quality of their original films and adaptations has taken a huge dive downwards in pretty much every category. Releases like THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX and JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR felt totally devoid of anything that made DC Animation the top of the heap; things like heart, emotion, urgency, drama and quality animation took a backseat to cranking out ready-made lowest-common-denominator ultra-violent snoozefests. And the latest addition, SON OF BATMAN is no exception.Based EXTREMELY loosely on Grant Morrison's opening arc of his writing duties on the BATMAN comic, the film opens at the training facility of Ra's Al Ghul's League of Assassins, which is under attack by an army of mercenaries led by Deathstroke (voiced by CRIMINAL MINDS' Thomas Gibson). After the onslaught, Talia (FIREFLY and HOMELAND's Morena Baccarin) sends her son Damian to Gotham City to meet his father, Batman (Jason O'Mara) for his safety. Batman had shared a night of passion with his on/off lover Talia (while he was apparently drugged?!?) and that night produced Damian. Damian is an overly-entitled, borderline sociopathic 10-year-old assassin who's been trained by the League since he could walk. Batman has some reluctance to take Damian in, but only when he starts displaying his murderous tendencies does Batman really believe he has to give guidance and instruct his son that killing is not the answer. Nightwing (FIREFLY's Sean Maher) appears on the scene for... reasons. Apparently, Ra's had intended upon using the Man-Bat formula developed by Kirk Langstrom (career character actor Xander Berkeley) to create unstoppable flying ninjas, and now Deathstroke has hijacked those plans. This leads Batman to allow Damian to don the cape and cowl of Robin and become his new crimefighting partner as they hunt down Deathstroke to put an end to his plans.Aside from the fact that most of the events in this film do not take place in Morrison's arc, this is not a good film at all. One of the best things that I can say about it is that it plays like a below-average Bond film rather than a straight-up comic book film, which is an interesting direction to go in. There are some good zingers tossed around particularly between Alfred and Damian, and the characterization of Damian is pretty well done, but that's about it. The pacing is atrocious, the animation is barely tolerable (particularly when you have CG vehicles against a hand-drawn background, which is something that has been an issue for a while with the DC Animated films, since BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD), the voice acting of O'Mara and Gibson (which is an actor I love) is boring, cool characters like Nightwing are horrifically underused, the writing is terrible, and the film is INCREDIBLY violent. This is a trend that has been evident since THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX, and it's something that needs to stop being this gratuitous. Frankly, I'm a little shocked that some of these films got a PG-13 rating. The bloodletting is particularly brutal in the opening sequence, as well as moments with Talia being abused by Deathstroke and Damian being &#34;crucified&#34; by a knife and a sword. These aren't necessarily meant for kids anyway, but instead of it being interesting or dramatic, it was just uncomfortably and relentlessly bloody which just becomes numbing after this much of it.SON OF BATMAN is another sad, poorly executed misfire in a catalog of new DC Animated releases that is growing with pretty much each subsequent film.",2,"A revamped misfire of the beginning of a critical BATMAN arc, and a major slog to get through to the end.",1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,3744,"['DC', 'Animated', 'used', 'be', 'where', 'fans', 'good', 'animated', 'long-form', 'superhero', 'adventures', 'could', 'go', 'get', 'smart', 'well-told', 'well-acted', 'well-animated', 'storytelling', 'key', 'words', 'being', '34', 'used', '34', 'Ever', 'genius', 'creator', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'left', 'DC', 'Animated', 'quality', 'original', 'films', 'adaptations', 'taken', 'huge', 'dive', 'downwards', 'pretty', 'much', 'category', 'Releases', 'FLASHPOINT', 'PARADOX', 'JUSTICE', 'LEAGUE', 'WAR', 'felt', 'totally', 'devoid', 'anything', 'made', 'DC', 'Animation', 'top', 'heap', 'things', 'heart', 'emotion', 'urgency', 'drama', 'quality', 'animation', 'took', 'backseat', 'cranking', 'out', 'ready-made', 'lowest-common-denominator', 'ultra-violent', 'snoozefests', 'latest', 'addition', 'SON', 'OF', 'BATMAN', 'exception.Based', 'EXTREMELY', 'loosely', 'Grant', 'Morrison', 'opening', 'arc', 'writing', 'duties', 'BATMAN', 'comic', 'film', 'training', 'facility', 'Ra', 'Al', 'Ghul', 'League', 'Assassins', 'attack', 'army', 'mercenaries', 'led', 'Deathstroke', 'voiced', 'CRIMINAL', 'MINDS', 'Thomas', 'Gibson', 'onslaught', 'Talia', 'FIREFLY', 'HOMELAND', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'son', 'Damian', 'Gotham', 'City', 'meet', 'father', 'Batman', 'Jason', ""O'Mara"", 'safety', 'Batman', 'had', 'shared', 'night', 'passion', 'on/off', 'lover', 'Talia', 'was', 'apparently', 'drugged', 'night', 'produced', 'Damian', 'Damian', 'overly-entitled', 'borderline', 'sociopathic', '10-year-old', 'assassin', 'who', 'been', 'trained', 'League', 'could', 'walk', 'Batman', 'reluctance', 'take', 'Damian', 'only', 'when', 'displaying', 'murderous', 'tendencies', 'Batman', 'really', 'believe', 'give', 'guidance', 'instruct', 'son', 'killing', 'not', 'answer', 'Nightwing', 'FIREFLY', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'scene', 'reasons', 'Apparently', 'Ra', 'had', 'intended', 'using', 'Man-Bat', 'formula', 'developed', 'Kirk', 'Langstrom', 'career', 'character', 'actor', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'create', 'unstoppable', 'flying', 'ninjas', 'now', 'Deathstroke', 'hijacked', 'plans', 'Batman', 'allow', 'Damian', 'don', 'cape', 'cowl', 'Robin', 'become', 'new', 'crimefighting', 'partner', 'hunt', 'down', 'Deathstroke', 'put', 'end', 'plans.Aside', 'fact', 'most', 'events', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'Morrison', 'arc', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'can', 'say', 'below-average', 'Bond', 'film', 'rather', 'straight-up', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'interesting', 'direction', 'go', 'are', 'good', 'zingers', 'tossed', 'around', 'particularly', 'Alfred', 'Damian', 'characterization', 'Damian', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'pacing', 'atrocious', 'animation', 'barely', 'tolerable', 'particularly', 'when', 'have', 'CG', 'vehicles', 'hand-drawn', 'background', 'something', 'been', 'issue', 'while', 'DC', 'Animated', 'films', 'BATMAN', 'THE', 'RED', 'HOOD', 'voice', 'acting', ""O'Mara"", 'Gibson', 'actor', 'love', 'boring', 'cool', 'characters', 'Nightwing', 'are', 'horrifically', 'underused', 'writing', 'terrible', 'film', 'INCREDIBLY', 'violent', 'trend', 'been', 'evident', 'FLASHPOINT', 'PARADOX', 'something', 'stop', 'being', 'gratuitous', 'Frankly', ""'m"", 'little', 'shocked', 'films', 'got', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'bloodletting', 'particularly', 'brutal', 'opening', 'sequence', 'as', 'well', 'moments', 'Talia', 'being', 'abused', 'Deathstroke', 'Damian', 'being', '34', 'crucified', '34', 'knife', 'sword', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'meant', 'kids', 'anyway', 'instead', 'being', 'interesting', 'dramatic', 'was', 'just', 'uncomfortably', 'relentlessly', 'bloody', 'just', 'numbing', 'much', 'it.SON', 'OF', 'BATMAN', 'sad', 'poorly', 'executed', 'misfire', 'catalog', 'new', 'DC', 'Animated', 'growing', 'pretty', 'much', 'subsequent', 'film']",DCU: Son of Batman (DVD)

1682864,A20IPZQ38M96RB,B00GZ0ML2Y,J. Bakker,"[11, 16]","Full review at Metal Arcade.NetSon of Batman, the 20th DC Universe Animated Original Movie and an adaptation of Grant Morrison&#8217;s comic series &#8220;Batman and Son&#8221;, finds the Dark Knight (played by Jason O&#8217;Mara, who also voiced the character in Justice League: War) discovering that he has a child with Talia Al Ghul (Morena Baccarin). Filled with great action, witty dialogue, and superb animation, Son of Batman satisfies on many levels &#8211; it&#8217;s personally one of my favorite DC animated films since Batman: Under The Red Hood.After the headquarters of the League of Shadows is attacked, Talia and her father Ra&#8217;s Al Ghul (Giancarlo Esposito of Breaking Bad fame) attempt to defend the fortress in a breathtaking fight sequence. Right from the start, the eponymous son of Batman, Damian Wayne (Stuart Allan), showcases his incredible ability &#8211; shooting and slicing down wave after wave of mercenaries and facing down Deathstroke himself (Thomas Gibson). Soon after, Talia takes Damian to Gotham City to meet his father, as she believes he&#8217;ll be safer with Bruce for the time being. Damian has been trained his entire life to inherit Ra&#8217;s title as head of the League of Shadows, and possesses wisdom and skill far beyond his ten years. However, it falls to Bruce to teach him respect, restraint and control, as when Damian lands on the doorstep of Wayne Manor he&#8217;s essentially an entitled, petulant child. His egotistical attitude quickly gnaws at the nerves of butler Alfred Pennyworth (David McCallum), and the original Robin, Nightwing (Sean Maher).Damian quickly assumes the mantle of Robin (after providing a few cheeky remarks at the expense of Nightwing&#8217;s original Robin uniform), and vows to track down and kill those who attacked the League of Shadows compound. Over the course of the film Damian learns to curb his rage and ruthless nature, eventually becoming a huge asset to Batman.As for the voice acting, Stuart Allan is great as Damian Wayne, easily capturing the character&#8217;s sardonic wit and egotistical nature. Jason O&#8217;Mara does a solid job in his second turn as Bruce Wayne/ Batman, after Justice League: War. Giancarlo Esposito was a cool choice for Ra&#8217;s Al Ghul, but sadly the character isn&#8217;t in the film for very long. Sean Maher plays off of Allan&#8217;s Damian quite well, and the two offer up some of Son of Batman&#8217;s funniest moments. Morena Baccarin is merely decent as Talia, as she seems to be phoning in the role a bit and spends most of the movie as a damsel in distress. Thomas Gibson&#8217;s voice seemed out of place as Deathstroke &#8211; his voice just doesn&#8217;t fit the character in my opinion, but maybe I&#8217;m too used to Manu Bennett&#8217;s awesome interpretation of the character on CW&#8217;s Arrow.The Blu-ray of Son of Batman offers some good extras and featurettes. &#8220;The Fang and the Demon Head: The League of Assassins&#8221; tells the story of Ra&#8217;s Al Ghul&#8217;s beginnings as a doctor before his wife was murdered and he gave into the maddening effects of the Lazarus Pit &#8211; whose rejuvenating energy has also granted him nearly 500 years of life. It also sheds some light on Talia as a character, beginning life in the comics as nothing more than a femme fatale and growing into a much more nuanced, layered character that would one day manage to seduce Batman &#8211; if Bruce Wayne would not marry Talia and take Ra&#8217;s place as the head of the League of Shadows, she would make an heir.&#8220;Strange Blood Ties: Damian Wayne&#8221; focuses on Bruce and Talia&#8217;s son, who would one day take up the mantle of Robin as one of Batman&#8217;s greatest sidekicks. It talks about Damian&#8217;s upbringing as the heir to the League of Shadows throne, and how he struggles to fit in in the Batcave alongside Nightwing and Alfred, who he sees as simply beneath him, before Bruce instills a sense of honor and respect in Damian. The feature also showcases issue 666 of Batman, which showed a future where Bruce is not successful at getting through to Damian, who becomes a much more chaotic, lethal, and darker version of Batman. This is an interesting story element that I wish would have been explored in Son of Batman, but sadly it was left on the cutting room floor.The final extras on the Son of Batman Blu-ray include &#8220;Designing the Characters with Phil Bourassa&#8221;, where the lead artist goes into great detail about how he took the character designs from rough sketches to final renders, including his thought process behind coloring, linework, and adapting designs from the comics. We also get a sneak peek at the upcoming Batman: Assault on Arkham animated film, which is based on the videogame series and looks great so far. Finally, there&#8217;s four Batman cartoons from the DC Vault, including an episode of Batman: The Animated Series and Batman Beyond.While Son of Batman makes considerable alterations to its source material, there&#8217;s still a lot to like about the 20th animated feature from DC. Son of Batman has perhaps the most action of any DC animated feature thus far, and some great dialogue and characterization as well. The animation is beautifully rendered, and the Blu-ray features a respectable amount of extras and an Ultraviolet Digital HD code.",4,There's a lot to like about the 20th animated feature from

I don't think he should be a character in the DC universe just due to the fact that I don't think Batman should have a son. Anyway, the movie is decent enough with a satisfying display of fight scenes and character design; however the movie kinda falls flat with character chemistry. A lot of the voice overs for each character really felt like they were not meant to go together. In some ways it felt as though they picked up some random person off the street and gave them a character of their choosing to voice. Ras Al Ghoul and Death stroke were the worst in my opinion; I couldn't stand there voices at times. Now I'm not 100% sure but I don't think Death Stroke has or has had anything to do with the league of Assassins. So his connection with them here felt really off. He felt a bit off script, as though he wasn't a super solder contracted killer.

That does not mean I believe my opinion or thoughts are not relevant, but it is just a distinction between novice and pro. In this case, the topic of Son of Batman, I hope I can offer some perspective that supports what other reviewers have written, but also encourages those who may not be as informed about the true history of Damon Wayne. It was about 3, maybe 4 years ago that I was first introduced to the discrepancies too many movies, including animations, make by not staying true to the history of a character. My father-in-law, whose comic book collection is jaw dropping to see, row after row of long cardboard boxes full of comics, bag and boarded, told me something I had never considered. The majority of his collections are Marvel, and when asking his opinion on some Marvel movie that was probably being released at that time, he spoke about his dissatisfaction as it relates to the history of a Marvel character or group  of characters that too often is not reflected in films. That was interesting to hear, especially when he began to pull out much older series to show what he meant. I mention this because I am thinking of one review left here and how the reviews states too much of Son of Batman was changed from the original storyline. Because I do not have that background knowledge, just speaking strictly from watching Son of Batman, it is definitely worth the money. But I completely get where the reviewer is coming from because when Marvel announced that Iron Man 3 would be, at least partially, based on Iron Man: Extremis. Man, I was so amped up because I discovered Iron Man: Extremis on Itunes and it was not until the 3rd or 4th episode that I learned it was from comic books or a graphic novel. I think this was in 2009, and I immediately purchased the graphic novel and enjoyed it so much that I bought the DVD of Extremis and the graphic novel as part of the gifts to my father-in-law for his retirement. Unfortunately, Marvel did not do the film justice because too many key elements were changed and they even made The Mandarin into a stupid, secondhand character, which is a complete 180 from his definition in the comics. I understand that additions must be made because a comic or graphic novel may not have sufficient material to make a 2-2 1/2 hour movie. But no one should be expected to turn off what he or she already knows as that is a large portion of the draw when you pay good money to gain access to the theater. For those of you who already know the actual history of Damon and how he was introduced to Bruce Wayne, even how Deathstroke lost his eye (which I do not think Damon had anything to do with, but please correct me if I am wrong), the slights made against the true followers of The Dark Knight will probably end up with a bad taste in their mouth. But for those of you like me who only learned about Damon during The New 52, you will be blown away. There's a lot, A LOT, of blood and action to keep you engaged. The voice acting can at times seem too monotone and unable to give real emotion, and yes this means Batman, too. I've watched it twice now so I enjoyed it. There is even a moment of foreshadowing that suggests Damon will become Batman with his own feature film. Again, I truly enjoyed this, and I think you will, too, but for the hardcore fan, please write your own perspective and teach those of us who do not know better, what, if any, elements work within the film and what you think is absolutely garbage and unnecessary. I hope this helps anyone straddling the fence on this one, and if you find yourself steamed about this one, just remember Batman: Assault on Arkham is coming soon and should be the cure for the common anger.",5,~Beware parents: this is NOT for children!~ For Adults only.~,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,3923,"['Sometimes', 'when', 'begin', 'write', 'review', 'particular', 'subjects', 'may', 'feel', 'less', 'adequate', 'when', 'others', 'have', 'much', 'deeper', 'connection', 'product', 'honestly', 'hesitate', 'write', 'anything', 'not', 'mean', 'believe', 'opinion', 'thoughts', 'are', 'not', 'relevant', 'just', 'distinction', 'novice', 'pro', 'case', 'topic', 'Son', 'Batman', 'hope', 'can', 'offer', 'perspective', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'also', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'informed', 'true', 'history', 'Damon', 'Wayne', 'was', 'about', '3', 'maybe', '4', 'years', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'discrepancies', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'including', 'animations', 'make', 'not', 'staying', 'true', 'history', 'character', 'father-in-law', 'comic', 'book', 'collection', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'see', 'row', 'row', 'long', 'cardboard', 'boxes', 'full', 'comics', 'bag', 'boarded', 'told', 'something', 'had', 'never', 'considered', 'majority', 'collections', 'are', 'Marvel', 'when', 'asking', 'opinion', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'being', 'released', 'time', 'spoke', 'dissatisfaction', 'history', 'Marvel', 'character', 'group', 'characters', 'too', 'often', 'not', 'reflected', 'films', 'was', 'interesting', 'hear', 'especially', 'when', 'began', 'pull', 'out', 'much', 'older', 'series', 'show', 'what', 'meant', 'mention', 'am', 'thinking', 'one', 'review', 'left', 'here', 'how', 'reviews', 'states', 'too', 'much', 'Son', 'Batman', 'was', 'changed', 'original', 'storyline', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'background', 'knowledge', 'just', 'speaking', 'strictly', 'watching', 'Son', 'Batman', 'definitely', 'worth', 'money', 'completely', 'get', 'where', 'reviewer', 'coming', 'when', 'Marvel', 'announced', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'partially', 'based', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Extremis', 'Man', 'was', 'so', 'amped', 'up', 'discovered', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Extremis', 'Itunes', 'was', 'not', '3rd', '4th', 'episode', 'learned', 'was', 'comic', 'books', 'graphic', 'novel', 'think', 'was', '2009', 'immediately', 'purchased', 'graphic', 'novel', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Extremis', 'graphic', 'novel', 'part', 'gifts', 'father-in-law', 'retirement', 'Unfortunately', 'Marvel', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'film', 'justice', 'too', 'many', 'key', 'elements', 'were', 'changed', 'even', 'made', 'Mandarin', 'stupid', 'secondhand', 'character', 'complete', '180', 'definition', 'comics', 'understand', 'additions', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'comic', 'graphic', 'novel', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'sufficient', 'material', 'make', '2-2', '1/2', 'hour', 'movie', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'turn', 'off', 'what', 'already', 'large', 'portion', 'draw', 'when', 'pay', 'good', 'money', 'gain', 'access', 'theater', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'actual', 'history', 'Damon', 'how', 'was', 'introduced', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'even', 'how', 'Deathstroke', 'lost', 'eye', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Damon', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'please', 'correct', 'am', 'wrong', 'slights', 'made', 'true', 'followers', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'will', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'who', 'only', 'learned', 'Damon', 'New', '52', 'will', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'lot', 'LOT', 'blood', 'action', 'keep', 'engaged', 'voice', 'acting', 'can', 'times', 'seem', 'too', 'monotone', 'unable', 'give', 'real', 'emotion', 'yes', 'Batman', 'too', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'twice', 'now', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'moment', 'foreshadowing', 'Damon', 'will', 'become', 'Batman', 'own', 'feature', 'film', 'Again', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'will', 'too', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'please', 'write', 'own', 'perspective', 'teach', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'better', 'what', 'elements', 'work', 'film', 'what', 'think', 'absolutely', 'garbage', 'unnecessary', 'hope', 'anyone', 'straddling', 'fence', 'one', 'find', 'steamed', 'one', 'just', 'remember', 'Batman', 'Assault', 'Arkham', 'coming', 'soon', 'should', 'be', 'cure', 'common', 'anger']",DCU: Son of Batman (DVD)

Son of Batman is a great, action-packed animation many people will enjoy.This film has a lot of elements to admire - thrilling Batman-class fighting that kept me excited and at the edge of my seat. There is also some romance between Batman and his 'special person' which is short, but nice and I thought it fit well.The story starts when a training camp is destroyed. A young boy escapes with his mom and flees to Batman who, as it turns out, is the boy's father. For his safety, Batman takes the child and, as Batman, tries to protect and train him. Batman teaches his kid to take criminals alive but, a new mystery arises - one that will have a significant impact on the story line. We join Batman, Robin, and Batman's son as they face off deadly people while Batman makes sure his kid doesn't hurt himself. It's a fun and action adventure that all Batman fans will appreciate!Overall, I think this movie had some ups and downs. The animation is rather interesting but, I thought it was a bit too much at times. It is gory at times, yet plastic and 2D like most superhero animations. I believe that the animators could have cut down a bit on the violence and mature content. Also, the animation of the faces looks a bit fake to me. The directing is interesting. I thought that the angles were good and fit the storyline quite well. The voice-overs are excellent.  For example, Jason O Marra who is the voice of Batman, doesn't show much emotion and talks in a quiet and dark whisper - perfect for the character. The plot is original and surprising, which I am fond of. For the most part, Son of Batman turns out to be a very unexpected and surprising adventure.My favorite scene is the first scene iwhen the academy is destroyed. Even though this is a sad moment, it sets the tone for the entire movie. I love scenes that may not seem important but have a big impact on the rest of the film.This movie has lots of adult lines and a lot of gory scenes, so I recommend for ages 11 to18. I also give it 4 out of 5 stars because of some hiccups with the animation.",4,"When You Thought There Was Nothing New About Batman, You Learn He Has a Son!",1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,2123,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'original', 'great', 'story', 'Son', 'Batman', 'great', 'action-packed', 'animation', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy.This', 'film', 'lot', 'elements', 'admire', 'thrilling', 'Batman-class', 'fighting', 'kept', 'excited', 'edge', 'seat', 'also', 'romance', 'Batman', ""'special"", 'person', 'short', 'nice', 'thought', 'fit', 'well.The', 'story', 'when', 'training', 'camp', 'destroyed', 'young', 'boy', 'escapes', 'mom', 'flees', 'Batman', 'who', 'out', 'boy', 'father', 'safety', 'Batman', 'child', 'Batman', 'protect', 'train', 'Batman', 'kid', 'take', 'criminals', 'alive', 'new', 'mystery', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'significant', 'impact', 'story', 'line', 'join', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Batman', 'son', 'face', 'off', 'deadly', 'people', 'Batman', 'sure', 'kid', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'fun', 'action', 'adventure', 'Batman', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Overall', 'think', 'movie', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'animation', 'rather', 'interesting', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'times', 'gory', 'times', 'plastic', '2D', 'most', 'superhero', 'animations', 'believe', 'animators', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'down', 'bit', 'violence', 'mature', 'content', 'Also', 'animation', 'bit', 'fake', 'directing', 'interesting', 'thought', 'angles', 'were', 'good', 'fit', 'storyline', 'quite', 'well', 'voice-overs', 'are', 'excellent', 'example', 'Jason', 'O', 'Marra', 'who', 'voice', 'Batman', ""n't"", 'show', 'much', 'emotion', 'talks', 'quiet', 'dark', 'whisper', 'perfect', 'character', 'plot', 'original', 'surprising', 'am', 'fond', 'most', 'part', 'Son', 'Batman', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'unexpected', 'surprising', 'adventure.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'first', 'scene', 'iwhen', 'academy', 'destroyed', 'Even', 'sad', 'moment', 'tone', 'entire', 'movie', 'love', 'scenes', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'important', 'have', 'big', 'impact', 'rest', 'film.This', 'movie', 'lots', 'adult', 'lines', 'lot', 'gory', 'scenes', 'recommend', 'ages', '11', 'to18', 'also', 'give', '4', '5', 'stars', 'hiccups', 'animation']",DCU: Son of Batman (DVD)

What keeps this movie from being 4 stars is the voice acting.  All of the actors sound flat and emotionless.  When talking about the death of Talia's father, Talia and Damion have no emotion in their voice.  The same goes for any of the characters that are in any danger.  Batman's voice is good for the character, but shows no emotion only the same monotone voice whether he is talking about the death of his parents or fighting bad guys.  Deathstroke is one of the worst, he loses an eye but his tone of voice is emotionless and shows no sign of pain.  Their is also a scene where Bruce and Damion are arguing in Bruce's office.  The voices are so emotionless any power the scene might have had was lost.

1682890,AK9Q6HTFF8HTS,B00GZ0ML2Y,Sebast Sterling,"[0, 0]","I had a free Redbox rental so I viewed this for free. Not worth paying for. Animation is similar to the cheapo Japanimation of the 1980s, but without the silly charm. (Where's Bruce Timm and Paul Dini when you need them??)  Poor voice actors, but to be fair, no one will replace Kevin Conroy. (They have Xander Berkeley in the voice cast, so why wasn't he Batman??)  I'm not sure why Talia lacks a European accent.  Judging from her voice actress, the director grabbed the first young chick he found in a Seattle Starbucks.I get the feeling this was made for the Japanese market, then dubbed with English for release in America. You notice this because sometimes the voice actors speak more quickly, or more slowly, to fill up frame time that was designed for the peculiarities of a Japanese script.  But I could be wrong.....Honestly, I'm growing weary of this focus on the League of Assassins in the Batman stories.  It started with Batman Begins and it hasn't ended. The end result is that Batman is now just a glorified ninja, which was never, never true at all.  Bruce Wayne trained with many experts, not just the LOA.  And man-bats? Why did they bring back the nonsensical man-bats here?? I thought we left them all behind in the sloppy 70s.Warner Bros. animation has made some terrific full-length Batman cartoons. (Superman/Batman Public Enemies and the superb Batman: Under the Red Hood).  Even Superman/Batman Apocalypse was pretty good, because it had Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly. But then DC dumped all its veteran voice actors and outsourced the animation to farm-team hacks. It all went downhill starting with Batman: Year One, then The Dark Knight Returns garbage.  I think that's when they starting Japanimating everything, which truly lowers the quality.From what I understand, Kevin Conroy is returning in Assault on Arkham in 2014.

Those two titles were so well put together from the great pacing, animation, plot, and personality of the characters. I was expecting a similar experience when watching Son of Batman seeing as the animation team seem to be the exact same one. However gone was the great story pacing and produced was movie so forced and barely believable. Too many plot holes in this movie such as the inclusion of deathstroke. Animation looks great as ever but everything else is just poor in this movie.",2,One of the most forced DC movies that shames the batman series,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,602,"['Prior', 'watching', 'Son', 'Batman', 'last', 'DC', 'animated', 'movies', 'saw', 'was', 'Justice', 'League', 'War', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'two', 'titles', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'great', 'pacing', 'animation', 'plot', 'personality', 'characters', 'was', 'expecting', 'similar', 'experience', 'when', 'watching', 'Son', 'Batman', 'seeing', 'animation', 'team', 'seem', 'be', 'exact', 'same', 'one', 'However', 'gone', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'pacing', 'produced', 'was', 'movie', 'so', 'forced', 'barely', 'believable', 'Too', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'movie', 'such', 'inclusion', 'deathstroke', 'Animation', 'great', 'ever', 'everything', 'else', 'just', 'poor', 'movie']",DCU: Son of Batman (DVD)
1682902,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00GZ0ML2Y,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","I am firmly in the camp that the whole premise of Batman having a son was a bad idea.  That said, Son of Batman is a moderately entertaining film and certainly better than the last original DC animated film, Justice League: War.  The film is an adaption of 2006 Grant Morrison storyline &#8220;Batman and Son&#8221; although the film makes wholesale changes to the plot and characters.In the League of Assassin&#8217;s mountain stronghold we meet young Damian, the son of Talia al Ghul and grandson of Ra&#8217;s al Ghul.  Although still just a boy Damian has grown up in the league and is already an extremely skilled fighter as well as having a genius intellect.  The fortress is attacked by Deathstoke and a force of armed soldier.  Deathstroke had been Ra&#8217;s al Ghul&#8217;s second-in-command but was tossed out.  He has returned looking for revenge.  The League manages to fight off the invaders but Ra&#8217;s al Ghul is gravely injured and not even the restorative Lazarus Pit can save him.  He dies leaving Damian shattered but vowing revenge.Talia tells Damian it&#8217;s time he finally meets his father and takes him to Gotham to meet Batman.  Batman is skeptical at first but runs his own tests to confirm that Damian is indeed his son.  Damian is shown the Batcave and given full run of Wayne Manor, much to Alfred&#8217;s annoyance as Damian proves a petulant, demanding, and egomaniac.  The strength of the film lies in the relationship between Damian and those around him, notably Batman and Nightwing.  Nightwing replaces the Tim Drake Robin role from the comics which causes the film to lose that rivalry aspect between the two.  There are some humorous bits where Damian keeps asking to drive the Batmobile and the like but ultimately the relationship between father and son is barely explored.They learn that Deathstroke has kidnapped the family of Dr. Kirk Langstrom, the guy who created the Man-Bat formula.  Deathstroke forces Langstrom to help him create an army of super-ninja man-bats (I kid you not it was also in the comics) that he will use to take over the League of Assassins.  Along the way Batman and Nightwing have to teach Damian some basic life lessons such as you simply can&#8217;t go around killing everyone&#8230;you know, the basic stuff.Son of Batman is one of the most adult-themed animated films yet, featuring strong language and a heavy dose of violence.  You wish however that the relationship between Batman and Damian would have received the same treatment instead of handled with so much dry humor.  Deathstroke was not part of the original storyline.  In the comics it was actually Talia who kidnapped Langstrom&#8217;s family and is the main antagonist.  I supposed with Deathstroke playing such a prominent role in the Arrow TV series that they wanted to keep him front and center.Deathstroke as the villain is fine&#8230;Thomas Gibson (Criminal Minds) as the voice of Deathstroke, not so much.  Gibson may very well provide the worst voice performance in any DC animated film.  His Deathstroke sounds like a stressed accountant.  Compared to Manu Bennett&#8217;s gravelly voice oozing with bad intentions, Gibson&#8217;s take is positively feeble.  Jason O&#8217; Mara returns for his second turn as Batman/Bruce Wayne and while he is no Kevin Conroy, he&#8217;s more than serviceable.  Screen veteran David McCallum (The Man from U.N.C.L.E.) provides the voice of Alfred for the second time and is a standout.Son of Batman makes a lot of changes from the original story arc, some good some bad.  Its biggest missed opportunity was in failing to deal more with the relationship between father and son.  As a pure comic action film however, it still manages to hit enough high notes to make it worth checking out.",3,... whole premise of Batman having a son was a bad idea.

Not just for any kind of boy, but this one is also the son of Talia Al-Ghul. Trained in the arts of the League of Shadows we get a 'Lion King' like story, in which an rouge member of the organization wants to take it over for himself. Talia leaves Damian with his birth father Bruce Wayne and there he learns that are ways to serve justice with out killing people. Eventually Damian would end up becoming the 4th Boy Wonder.This film is far from perfect, but it has a lot of high notes. The voice cast as always works well, this time featuring Jason O'Mara and Stewart Alan playing Batman & Robin as well as two former Firefly cast-mates Morena Baccarin and Sean Maher. The movie has tons of action some great lines and a ton of surprise appearances that would be appreciated by any Batman fan. Where the films lacks is through a lot of gaps in the story. We know that in between scenes certain things happen, but we have to use our imaginations in order to see them. I would have loved to see Damian fight Nightwing, but I guess we don't always get what we want.'Son of Batman', may not hold a candle to previous DCU Batman films like 'The Dark Knight Returns' or Under 'The Red Hood'. What it does bring us is an enjoyable new film one that is worthy to be included in the ever growing DCU film library. It also holds true to the darker tone these film project have taken since Sam Register became executive producer of this franchise.
