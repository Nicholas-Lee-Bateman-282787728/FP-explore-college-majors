I love Jamie Lee Curtis and was excited to hear that she was playing the role of the mother in thsi film loosely based on the 70's original with Jodie Foster. The film starts off slow, but gets better fast with plenty of funny moments and excellent acting from the cast. They're very believable.The plot is based around a mother who is about to get married and her rebellious, punk-ish daughter who happen to switch places thanks to an Asian curse placed on them. They then discover that each others lives wasn't as easy as I thought. Great modern re-make. Funny, but not at all vulgar.

616690,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B00005JMCW,Amanda Richards,"[27, 29]","This is one of the most entertaining comedies I have seen in a long time.  I started smiling from the start up tune ""Happy Together"" by the Turtles and didn't stop until long after Simple Plan finished their version at the end.Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely brilliant as Tess Coleman, a harried psychiatrist with two children, about to remarry after the death of her husband.  Lindsay Lohan plays her daughter Anna, a rebellious teenager who can't see eye to eye with her mother.Comparing the Lindsay Lohan of this movie with the wafer thin girl she has become, it should be noted that she looked so much prettier, happier and healthier then, that I wish she'd look back at this movie and go out and eat something.You already know that this is a ""switch"" movie, and thanks to Lucille Soong as an interfering old woman, the switch is done with the crisp snap of a fortune cookie.  Both Curtis and Lohan handle the change in their characters admirably, and soon both Tess and Anna get a first hand understanding of each other's rather complicated lives.Mark Harmon has a supporting role as Tess' fianc&eacute; Ryan, and Chad Michael Murray plays Anna's love interest Jake, but this movie is all about the female leads as they get a new perspective, earn each other's respect and generally change each other, while at the same time delivering the laughs.Tess and Anna switchFortune cookie lets them be""Happy Together""Amanda Richards, July 25, 2005",5,When the cookie crumbles,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,1444,"['one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'comedies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'started', 'smiling', 'start', 'up', 'tune', 'Happy', 'Together', 'Turtles', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'long', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'finished', 'version', 'end.Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Tess', 'Coleman', 'harried', 'psychiatrist', 'two', 'children', 'remarry', 'death', 'husband', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'rebellious', 'teenager', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'eye', 'eye', 'mother.Comparing', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'movie', 'wafer', 'thin', 'girl', 'become', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'looked', 'so', 'much', 'prettier', 'happier', 'healthier', 'then', 'wish', ""'d"", 'look', 'back', 'movie', 'go', 'out', 'eat', 'something.You', 'already', 'know', 'switch', 'movie', 'thanks', 'Lucille', 'Soong', 'interfering', 'old', 'woman', 'switch', 'done', 'crisp', 'snap', 'fortune', 'cookie', 'Curtis', 'Lohan', 'handle', 'change', 'characters', 'admirably', 'soon', 'Tess', 'Anna', 'get', 'first', 'hand', 'understanding', 'other', 'rather', 'complicated', 'lives.Mark', 'Harmon', 'supporting', 'role', 'Tess', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Ryan', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'Anna', 'love', 'interest', 'Jake', 'movie', 'female', 'leads', 'get', 'new', 'perspective', 'earn', 'other', 'respect', 'generally', 'change', 'other', 'same', 'time', 'delivering', 'laughs.Tess', 'Anna', 'switchFortune', 'cookie', 'be', 'Happy', 'Together', 'Amanda', 'Richards', 'July', '25', '2005']",Freaky Friday

616693,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JMCW,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I think most everyone I know has seen the original Disney classic `Freaky Friday', the one with Jodie Foster.  I haven't.  I haven't even seen the original `Parent Trap', starring Hayley Mills either.  Not surprisingly, considering that I was born in the 80's, I've seen both the remakes starring Lindsay Lohan.  I really loved 1998's `The Parent Trap' (for which Lohan should have been up for an Oscar if you ask me) and so I was really excited about seeing `Freaky Friday'.  Sadly, this happened around the time that Lohan's star was rising and her personal life was tanking and, well, it shows in the fact that her acting skills are limited.She had presence, sure (just look at her) and she had major draw because she was young and pretty and young pre-teen girls and boys wanted to watch her in everything, but the talent level had pretty much leveled off and she didn't have the same spark and charisma she possessed as a child actress.  Here, she is just kind of boring.The real show stealer here is Jamie Lee Curtis, who clowns her way through each scene with serious energy that makes a giant impact.  Some of the scenes seem foolish and amateurish (like, she's portraying a teenager, not a child) but she pretty much nails not only the bipolar emotions but also the physical comedy, which can be really difficult to pull off so well.  Still, even with her hilarious performance, this film just doesn't reach the heights I wanted it to.  It isn't very well etched out and the jokes don't feel fresh by any means.  The stuffiness of the film as a whole is a deterrent for it lacks the spark to keep it invigorating.  I was surprised by this, but much like Lohan's performance, this film just kind of left me bored.",3,"The freaky thing is, this film is kind of bland...",1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,1721,"['think', 'most', 'everyone', 'know', 'seen', 'original', 'Disney', 'classic', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'one', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'have', ""n't"", 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'seen', 'original', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'starring', 'Hayley', 'Mills', 'either', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'considering', 'was', 'born', '80', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'remakes', 'starring', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'really', 'loved', '1998', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'Lohan', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'Oscar', 'ask', 'so', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'seeing', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'Sadly', 'happened', 'time', 'Lohan', 'star', 'was', 'rising', 'personal', 'life', 'was', 'tanking', 'well', 'fact', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'limited.She', 'had', 'presence', 'sure', 'just', 'look', 'had', 'major', 'draw', 'was', 'young', 'pretty', 'young', 'pre-teen', 'girls', 'boys', 'wanted', 'watch', 'everything', 'talent', 'level', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'leveled', 'off', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'spark', 'charisma', 'possessed', 'child', 'actress', 'Here', 'just', 'kind', 'boring.The', 'real', 'show', 'stealer', 'here', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'who', 'clowns', 'way', 'scene', 'serious', 'energy', 'giant', 'impact', 'scenes', 'seem', 'foolish', 'amateurish', 'portraying', 'teenager', 'not', 'child', 'pretty', 'much', 'not', 'only', 'bipolar', 'emotions', 'also', 'physical', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'difficult', 'pull', 'off', 'so', 'well', 'Still', 'even', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'reach', 'heights', 'wanted', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'etched', 'out', 'jokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fresh', 'means', 'stuffiness', 'film', 'whole', 'deterrent', 'spark', 'keep', 'invigorating', 'was', 'surprised', 'much', 'Lohan', 'performance', 'film', 'just', 'kind', 'left', 'bored']",Freaky Friday
616694,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B00005JMCW,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[2, 3]","Reading magazines and watching the news now, it's hard to believe that just two years ago, Lindsay Lohan was a beautiful, talented young actress who was on her way to becoming the next Ann-Margret, flaming red hair and all. Nowadays, she has become a talentless, wafer thin cleb, like all the other Hollywood stars.Oh well. But we could always look back on her early film work and enjoy the Lindsay that people loved. The red headed Irish girl with a million dollar smile, not the stick thin blonde that most people can't stomach. ""Freaky Friday"", the remake of the 1976 classic, gave the then 17 year old starlet her big break. It was her second film in seven years (following her debut in the ""Parent Trap"" remake), and might well be her best performance to date.Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis in top form) and her daughter Anna (Lohan) are two complete opposites. Tess is a successful pyschologist. Anna is a rebellious, punk rock living teen who can't stomach her mothe ror the fact that she is going to have a new dad, Harry (Mark Harmon). Anna's angst is caused by the passing of her father, so having another man take care of her is a harde pill to swallow. One night, the two go to a Chinese restaurant. While there, they have a huge fight, and a waitress gives them a fortune cookie. Then Anna locks herself in a bathroom. A strange, earthquake like occurence happens, and the next morning something happens.Anna and Tess wake up to realize they've switched bodies. Now, the two must go the days pretending their best to be each other -which, in Disney terms, means disaster. They learn the only way to get back their original forms is to learn to love, honor and respect each other. The fim wraps in a rather formulaic manner, but the film is enjoyable throughout.The two leading ladies are fantastic. Jamie Lee Curtis hasn't been this good in a while, while Lohan proved that at one point she was indeed a force to be reckoned with.The extras are decent, but it's the film you should watch. It's not the greatest film ever, but it's a wonderful way to pass the time.",4,A Fantatsic Remake Of The Original (4.5 Stars),1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,2077,"['Reading', 'magazines', 'watching', 'news', 'now', 'hard', 'believe', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'was', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'way', 'becoming', 'next', 'Ann-Margret', 'flaming', 'red', 'hair', 'Nowadays', 'become', 'talentless', 'wafer', 'thin', 'cleb', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'stars.Oh', 'well', 'could', 'always', 'look', 'back', 'early', 'film', 'work', 'enjoy', 'Lindsay', 'people', 'loved', 'red', 'headed', 'Irish', 'girl', 'million', 'dollar', 'smile', 'not', 'stick', 'thin', 'blonde', 'most', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'remake', '1976', 'classic', 'gave', 'then', '17', 'year', 'old', 'starlet', 'big', 'break', 'was', 'second', 'film', 'seven', 'years', 'following', 'debut', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'remake', 'might', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'performance', 'date.Tess', 'Coleman', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'top', 'form', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'Lohan', 'are', 'two', 'complete', 'opposites', 'Tess', 'successful', 'pyschologist', 'Anna', 'rebellious', 'punk', 'rock', 'living', 'teen', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'mothe', 'ror', 'fact', 'going', 'have', 'new', 'dad', 'Harry', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'Anna', 'angst', 'caused', 'passing', 'father', 'so', 'having', 'man', 'take', 'care', 'harde', 'pill', 'swallow', 'One', 'night', 'two', 'go', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'there', 'have', 'huge', 'fight', 'waitress', 'fortune', 'cookie', 'Then', 'Anna', 'bathroom', 'strange', 'earthquake', 'occurence', 'happens', 'next', 'morning', 'something', 'happens.Anna', 'Tess', 'wake', 'up', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'switched', 'bodies', 'Now', 'two', 'must', 'go', 'days', 'pretending', 'best', 'be', 'other', '-which', 'Disney', 'terms', 'disaster', 'learn', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'original', 'forms', 'learn', 'love', 'honor', 'respect', 'other', 'fim', 'wraps', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'manner', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'throughout.The', 'two', 'leading', 'ladies', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', ""n't"", 'been', 'good', 'while', 'Lohan', 'proved', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'indeed', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'with.The', 'extras', 'are', 'decent', 'film', 'should', 'watch', 'not', 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'wonderful', 'way', 'pass', 'time']",Freaky Friday

616703,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JMCW,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","This is the third adaption of the &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; book by author Mary Rogers. The first with Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris in 1977, and the second was a TV movie in the mid 90's with Shelley Long. This new adaption, I have to say, blows the other two out of the water. I went into this film knowing that it will probably be a nice little movie(which it is)and will probably think nothing more of it while and after I watched it. I am happy to say that I am wrong in that case. This Disney released film is a joy and a delight from the first frame to the very last. I credit the screenwriters and director Mark Waters for delivering a breezy, witty, lighthearted, lift me up romp that is sure to please and satisfy everyone looking for a nice family for everyone to watch. The film is about The Coleman family. Mom is Tess Coleman(Jamie Lee Curtis), a widowed psychiatrist trying to maintain a job, a home, and raising her two kids. Son Harry, and her 15 year old daughter Anna(Lindsay Lohan). What we soon come to learn is what we have already expected. Mom and daughter not getting along for all the usual reasons. It's the constant battle between young and adult, kids and parents. Anna is a rebel type who is in a rock band that plays in the garage, gets into trouble at school, and feels like everyone is against her. Mom Tess is just trying to keep things together after their father passed away 3 three years before. Tess is engaged to nice guy Ryan(Mark Harmon), and the wedding is in 2 days or so. After a dinner at a chinese restaraunt where Tess and Anna get into a fight, a chinese woman gives them a magical fortune cookie that makes the two change bodies. They wake up the next morning in each other's body's, and the fun really begins. Each try to be the other - Anna, in Tess' body, tries to do her mom's job and to keep up appearances with Ryan. Tess, in Anna's body, tries to go to school in Anna's place. Each learns a lesson while being each other and it's a lesson we have come to all know. It's not easy being a teenaged girl when you are going through changes, falling for boys for the first time, and thinking that nobody, especially your parents, don't understand you. And it's not easy being a single parent with a teenaged girl having to deal with her issues as well as your own and caring for the well being of your family and keeping the house standing. It's something we have seen countless times in movies and TV shows, but it really works here. The main reason for that are because of the wonderful performances by Jamie Lee and Lindsay. I have always been a fan of Jamie Lee's, but even more so now. She delivers a great performance that gets to showcase how good she is at comedy and at physical comedy. She has the moody,snotty teenager thing down pat. You can tell she is having a blast doing it, and it comes thru in the performance and enhances it even more. The performance from young Lohan is equally engaging. She was much better when she was acting as her mom than she was when she was herself. Playing her mom, she had a real knack for giving out a parental demeanor and it was strong and even endearing in some of her actions and mannerisms. The success and every winning aspect of this film is because of these two actresses. Mark Harmon has a pretty typical role, but it's nice to see him in a movie again. Chad Michael Murray, who is quickly becoming the new heartthrob for young girls around the world thanks to this movie and his series &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, is Jake. The token &quot;potential boyfriend&quot; that gets into the mix. Like Harmon, it's a pretty by the numbers type of character, but he does what he does. While it is so easy to dismiss a film like this for being light and fluffy, this one has better odds of making a longer impact than others because of it's sweetness and because of the appealing performances from Curtis and Lohan. I enjoyed this film a lot and it is just about as perfect as a nice family film can possibly be.

Although I did enjoy the Parent Trap b/c that was hilarious, I hated her other movies like Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and that Disney Channel movie Get a Clue.  Not being a big fan of Lindsay was the main reason I chose not to see this movie when it was in theaters.  However, a few weeks ago, my cousin was watching this movie so I decided to watch a little of it and to my surprise I found it to be very funny.  After that I knew I had to see this movie.  I finally caught it on STARZ a few days ago and I loved it.  I found it to be very entertaining and funny.  I have even watched a few times since then and I am still laughing.  It charming, funny, and it made me see a side of Jamie Lee Curtis I have never seen before.  I actually regret seeing this in theaters.  Here is the plot.Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Anna (Lindsay Lohan) Coleman have very frustrating lives.  Tess is a psychologist whose about to get married, yet her job is constantly frustrating her because she is constantly on 2 different cell phones or using a palm pilot.  Anna the daughter seems to be flunking in school, constantly going to detention, and always having to deal with her once best friend-now worst enemy rival in school.  And if that is not enough, both of them are always arguing against each other.  Anna always feels Tess is ruining her life she never listens and barely lets her music with her band.  Tess always feels like Anna acts the way she does because she feels the world revolves around.  But one day a magic spell causes them to wake up in each other's bodies!  Now what are they going to do.  They must somehow find way to switch back because Tess is getting married.  However when living in each other bodies, they both end up learning the difficulties in each other's lives and have a better understanding of each other.  In the end they both learn to have a better respect of each other.Freaky Friday is a funny well-moving film that deals with real life problems.

This version of Freaky Friday is an updated remake of their own 1977 film.On its face this is the classic body switch movie featuring a harried mother and her rebellious teenage daughter (at least by Disney standards). The roles here are played by Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsey Lohan. It is the portrayals that make this film. Both principles do a surprisingly good job with the material that they are given.This is by no means a bad film. Actually it has some funny moments. Not Academy Award good but acceptable for both children and adults. Disney seems to be banking on the power of its stars to carry the film and for the most part it succeeds.The DVD presents the film in both full and widescreen versions with a 5.1 Dolby soundtrack.

616717,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,B00005JMCW,Classic film buff,"[0, 0]","Like its predecessor 1998's ""The Parent Trap"", this is Walt Disney Pictures remake/update of their original film, also both ""The Parent Trap"" and ""Freaky Friday"" star Lindsay Lohan.  The difference is while ""The Parent Trap"" remake was as good as the 1961 original, although in a different way, this 2003 remake of 1976's ""Freaky Friday"" is much better than the original with Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster.  It's updated neatly into the twenty-first century with expert comic tandem acting by Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan.As the film opens it's a Thursday morning in Los Angeles, psychoanalyst Dr. Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) a widowed mother of two is planning to get remarried to Ryan (Mark Harmon) on Saturday.  While her young son Harry (Ryan Malgarini) seems all right with this, her rebellious teen-aged daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) isn't happy about it.  Anna and Tess also clash about Anna's schoolwork, band, appearance and general attitude, there is a definite generation gap.  At a family dinner that night at a Chinese restaurant, they openly battle in front of the owner's elderly mother who offers them fortune cookies which she insists they take.  Upon breaking the cookies they read the enigmatic fortune inside and experience an earthquake that only they can feel.  The next morning upon awakening Tess and Anna find to their horror they have somehow switched places, and each will have to experience the other's Friday, and try somehow to find a way to switch back before Saturday's wedding.  Through the course of the ""Freaky Friday"" each learns that the other's life is not quite as smooth or easy as she thought, as they try to get through the craziness of the day.Both Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are exceptional at capturing the dual roles they play.  I was particularly impressed by the way both women were able physically to suggest the change in character.  For example when Ms. Curtis is Anna in Tess' body, she is tends to be more relaxed in her posture, tends to lope along, slouching whereas Ms. Lohan as Tess in Anna's body is more rigid and precise in her movements.  They also tend to capture the subtle nuances of the other, and have a keen comic rapport, playing off exceptionally well with one another.  In a word, their performances are inspired and FUNNY, with some heartwarming moments as well, and give the film the sparkle that makes it work so well.  The supporting cast is fine, starting with Mark Harmon as Ryan, who is the perfect likeable fianc&eacute; for Tess, and young Ryan Malgarini as Harry, Anna's mischievous younger brother has some expert facial expressions as he reacts to a couple of bewildering situations.  The others Chad Michael Murray as Jake, Anna's would be boyfriend, Harold Gould as Grandpa, Christina Vidal and Haley Hudson as Anna's girlfriends, Rosalind Chao as Pei-Pei owner of the Chinese restaurant, Stephen Tobolowsky as Mr. Bates, Anna's obnoxious teacher and Willie Garson as Evan, Tess' most neurotic patient, all good.The screenplay by Heather Hatch and Leslie Dixon is a nicely done update of the original Mary Rodgers novel that was published in 1972, originally the mother was a housewife, here she is a working mother, while the daughter was a gawky thirteen year old with very few interests other than the boy next door, here she is fifteen and very interested in her band and music.  It's clever, and very amusing, and as I mentioned above gives both Misses Curtis and Lohan a chance to shine.  Besides this, it's very family friendly, younger kids can definitely watch and probably enjoy themselves.The music used is pretty good as well, starting with the 60's classic ""Happy Together"" by the Turtles played over the credits showing various paintings/photos which riffs into an updated version as the movie begins.  Anna's band's music I think will bridge the generation gap, both kids and parents can enjoy, Lindsay Lohan gets a solo at the end, and sounds pretty good. Best of the special features probably is the ""Backstage Pass with Lindsay Lohan"" a behind the scenes look at the film.  So sad to see Lindsay Lohan still relatively normal and unspoiled, considering her recent troubled history.  There is a deleted scene that really was not a great loss to the film, and also two alternative endings plus the ending used in the film, actually not much different in the various versions.  However director Mark Waters talks about the deleted scene and the various endings so the viewer is given his perspective.  There is a cute ""bloopers"" set, and two music videos, Lillix ""What I Like About You"", not bad, cute bit of business with Lindsay Lohan in it.  The second one I didn't especially care for, Halo Friendlies ""Me vs. the World"".Bottom line,  I highly recommend `""Freaky Friday"" it's a bright, lighthearted film that is very enjoyable entertainment  in the best Disney tradition, but which has an underlying message.  You could say it's that very old maxim ""Don't judge another human being until you walked a mile in his/her shoes"", or in this case body!",5,"""OOOOH, I'M LIKE THE CRYPT KEEPER!!!""",1380585600,"10

Each one feels the others life is so much easier than theirs but what they are soon to find out is that they really underestimate the other.

When they switch theres no sign of their previous charactor, for Jamie Lee Curtis 'becomes' Lindsay Lohan and visa versa.  Put them in situations strange to them and hilarity ensues.

616726,A1R8AO9XASQ15C,B00005JMCW,Daniel A. Marsh,"[3, 3]","This remake of the Barbara Harris/Jodie Foster film from the mid-1970s is a borderline 4-star picture. It's a classy, smart and very, VERY funny family film, one that does not insult grownups while it's tickling the kiddos. I don't own this one yet (my daughter does), but I have no doubt I'll be adding it to the family section of my DVD library.What's best about the movie is its acting. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are sensational; did any two actors give better performances in the summer of 2003? I always knew Curtis could play funny/tough/matronly/goofy, but Lohan pretty much comes out of nowhere to deliver what is, I think, a Best Supporting Actress-level performance.Lohan, if you will recall, played the twins in the 1998 remake of &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (another great family film -- strangely absent from DVD). She was wonderful there, but here she's sort of breathtaking. She plays both the mother and the daughter (she and Curtis switch bodies thanks to an Asian &quot;curse&quot;) with absolute conviction. I have a feeling we're watching the rise of a major talent. Who knows what this young actress will be doing 10 years from now?

This is one the funniest comedies released in 2003.  This remake of the 1976 version, starring Jodie Foster, lives up to the original.  The writers update the events very well, while adding new and original elements.  The laughs begin before Tess(Curtis) and Anna(Lohan) switch bodies because of a fortune cookie.  However, the laughs become more frequent in their struggle to get their bodies back.  Such hilarious scenes will be unforgettable to audiences.  Jamie Lee Curtis's Golden Globe nominated role(Best Actress in a Comedy Film) is one of her best in her 25-year acting career.  She, like all the other actors, adds her own sense of humor into the movie, offering audiences more viewing pleasure.  This film may not have been so magical if it wasn't for her.  Lindsay Lohan proves in her role that she'll be a big name actress in the near future.  &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; is a great movie for those looking for a great comedy.

How are you today?""","[2, 2]","Having been a lifelong fan of Mary Rodgers' classic novel ""Freaky Friday,"" as well as the Disney version from 1976 that let Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris play superego and id respectively, I approached this remake with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension.  Though much of Rodgers' novel is again (needlessly) reworked and cast aside, this remake has a flat-out scrumptious bonbon wrapped up in the recycled packaging: Jamie Lee Curtis.  If the 1976 version gave the edge to Foster's crisp, no-nonsense adult-in-a-teenager's body, this version lets Curtis as the teenager-in-the-adult loose on the park swings, and she doesn't stop until she's conquered the entire playground.  (As the daughter/mother, the adorable Lindsay Lohan mostly plays an adult via a bright, hyper-competent smile and careful elocution, though her punk-pop singing is joyfully  effective.)  Supporting actors like Harold Gould and Mark Harmon are mostly furniture (Harmon looks like you could dust him).  It's Curtis, with her vulpine smile and sexy swagger as she racks up the charge card, who inspires giggle fits of happiness, and when she and her daughter's boyfriend (Chad Michael Murray) breathlessly discuss bands they love in a coffee shop, it's pure, mooney bliss.

Psychiatrist Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her teenage daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) are constantly at war.  Tess is days away from remarrying, and Anna feels the acute pain of having lost her father.  Anna has found refuge in her music, but her mother fails to see the importance of it, pulling the plug (literally) on Anna's big break.  When a well-meaning Chinese woman ensures that they will be forced to understand each other's lives, the comedy begins full-force.  The two wake up trapped in the body (and the daily life) of the other.  The script is smart and punchy, with twists that are not as formulaic as the premise might suggest.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are hilarious in their interpretations of the generation gap.  While I expected such a performance from Curtis, Lohan was a wonderful surprise.  Without the chemistry and talent between these two actresses, the film could have been lackluster.  The other actors, most notably bland Mark Harmon, cannot sustain the energy Curtis and Lohan create.  With animated aplomb, they even manage to overcome a few missteps in the screenplay.This film provides some hearty laughs and, in the tradition of such films, sentimental tears at the end.

The basic plotline of this remake of the original has Mom(Jamie Lee Curtis) and daughter switching bodies for a day. Mom is hard-working and quick-witted woman and her daughter is a rebellious and uptight girl who plays in a rock band. Same plot as the original, but different backgrounds for the characters. It works well. I liked the psychical work from the characters. Curtis, from the body of the teenager, dresses hip in order to in with the crowd and the daughter's crush is falling for her! Curtis and the young actress Linsay Lohan give heartwarming performances and make the believibility of a real life mother and daughter seem real.

One of the owners sees Curtis and her daughter arguing intensely, and decides to do something about it, and essentially, the trick is that each of them has to see reality from the other person's eyes, and see what each other truly treasures.This is not a novel idea, but it works rather well in this film.

Jamie Lee Curtis is the &quot;Cher&quot; of motion pictures; people always forget how wonderful she is until she comes barreling back with another fantastic performance.  Both actresses have incredible comic flair and a true sense of physical comedy, as well as a chemistry that completely renders their mother-daughter relationship plausible.In terms of story, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; manages to incorporate contemporary themes like parental death, working parents, remarriage, blended families, teenage angst over love and school, and the like, without seeming preachy or offering any trite solutions.  Both mother and daughter learn the only way to heal their fractured relationship is to talk honestly with one another.  None of the plot lines or messages are rushed or underdeveloped, but presented simply without melodrama.  Thus the movie is accessible to children of all ages, respectful of teenagers and the problems they encounter, and is a nice diversion for adults and parents who are afraid to suffer through another &quot;kiddie&quot; movie.This movie was very well done, with good acting and sequence, a better-than-average plot, and a catchy soundtrack.

It was the first night of school in my senior year of high school. I said to myself, ""Hmm...I would like to go see a movie tonite!"" I looked at what was playing and nothing really caught my eye. So, I said to myself, ""Oh, I guess I will just go see 'Freaky Friday'!"" I had no clue whatsoever about what the movie was about. I didn't really have too high of expectations for this movie. I went in and took my seat. After the movie was over, I found myself saying ""WOW! That was a good movie!"" The music was great and well suited for the movie and the acting was superb. I decided to return to the movies again the next night.The next night, I had an even greater reaction to this movie. From that moment on, I knew that this movie was going to become one of my all-time favorite movies. I returned to the movies one last time a week later to enjoy this film for the third time on my 18th birthday. I honestly can't think of any better way I would have liked to spend my 18th birthday rather than in that theater watching ""Freaky Friday"".To all of you who don't own this movie and have seen it, (with a quote from one of Lindsay's songs in ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen""), ""What are you waiting for?""

Like an intrusion, teenage Anna and working-mother Tess find themselves magically transferred within one another's body after cracking open two fortune cookies at a Chinese restautant.The rest is history.  The two learn about one another's hectic lives and adapt just long enough to find a way to return to their own bodies and lives.

616764,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B00005JMCW,"John ""MovieAddict""","[3, 3]","The teenage years are hard. Countless films have been made about that era in every person's life, including this year's controversial &quot;13.&quot; And the biggest surprise may be the way Disney handles the subject in &quot;Freaky Friday,&quot; not toning down premises as they have before, but rather allowing all to flow freely and still making it a clean, moralistic family film.Oh, and adulthood is hard, too.&quot;Freaky Friday&quot; was originally released in 1976. The film starred Jodie Foster, and was never exactly the Disney family classic it meant to be (obviously copying &quot;The Parent Trap's&quot; style). It spawned a lot of copies, including a made-for-TV remake in 1995 with Shelley Long, not to mention a string of late-80s films, such as &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot;; &quot;18 Again&quot;; and &quot;Vice Versa.&quot; All were different variations on the basic premise of adults switching places with their offspring or younger relations, and the two then coming to appreciate their differences.Now the formula is seeing a steady increase in popularity once again. 2002's &quot;The Hot Chick&quot; (one of the worst of that year) was about a teenage girl who swapped places with a petty criminal. Now Disney is cashing in on something they made some 20 odd years ago, and no one -- myself included -- expected the film to be any good. Surprise, surprise.Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a widowed psychiatrist with two kids, including Anna (Lindsay Lohan), a 15-year-old highschooler with aspirations of punk rock status -- she and her friends get together in the garage of her house and &quot;jam.&quot; (I play guitar and, for the first time since &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; it looks as if the filmmakers put some effort to make the guitar players look like they are really playing the darn thing).&quot;You're ruining my life!&quot; Anna constantly yells. Tess' engaged boyfriend, Ryan (Mark Harmon), isn't sure what's going on between the two, but his attempts at being nice to the kids often backfires. (After Tess removes Anna's bedroom door due to low grades, Harmon tells Anna that it's under the staircase in an effort to make peace with her. &quot;Like I didn't figure that out already,&quot; she says.)When mother and daughter visit a Chinese restaurant and eat some magical fortune cookies, they wake up the next day as always -- expect they're in each other's bodies.And so here come the jokes. One bets that they can make it in school, the other at work. Tess, in Anna's body, acts like a mature adult. Meanwhile, Anna, in Tess' body, acts like a teenager -- she even gets a makeover.But there're problems. There's a wedding and a rock band audition, and since they're in each other's bodies, it presents a major dilemma. But if they want to switch back before their big days, then they'll have to learn to appreciate each other's differences.What a delightful little family film this is! Sweet, gentle, funny, and just plain enjoyable. It doesn't try to be anything it isn't, and in the process becomes a lot more. It has streaks of &quot;Big&quot; and &quot;Vice Versa.&quot; I've always enjoyed &quot;Vice Versa&quot; the most out of the many, many body-switching 80s films released simultaneously, and now I've found another worthy addition to the genre.Annette Bening was originally cast as Tess Coleman, but then Jamie Lee Curtis stepped in. And I'm glad she did. I'm not a very big fan of Curtis, but she can occasionally be quite surprising, and this is one of those cases. Meanwhile, Lindsay Lohan, the little girl from 1998's remake of &quot;The Parent Trap,&quot; evokes the same great method of adult channeling as little Fred Savage did in &quot;Vice Versa.&quot; As many of my readers probably know, my main problem with &quot;Big&quot; is that Tom Hanks did not act like a 13-year-old, but rather like a 6-year-old. Lohan successfully acts like both an irritating teenager and a mature adult. The two gals' performances really make the movie.This is one of the most enjoyable treats of the year. Kids will get a kick out of it, and so will parents, and that is precisely the definition of great family filmmaking -- because, let's face it, Disney lost sight of that a few years ago. Looks like they're finally getting back on their feet after a long dry spot.",4,&quot;Vice Versa&quot; meets &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (1976) meets &quot;Big.&quot;,1071878400,"12 20, 2003",2003,4324,"['teenage', 'years', 'are', 'hard', 'Countless', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'era', 'person', 'life', 'including', 'year', 'controversial', 'quot', '13.', 'quot', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'Disney', 'subject', 'quot', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'quot', 'not', 'toning', 'down', 'premises', 'have', 'before', 'rather', 'allowing', 'flow', 'freely', 'still', 'making', 'clean', 'moralistic', 'family', 'film.Oh', 'adulthood', 'hard', 'quot', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'quot', 'was', 'originally', 'released', '1976', 'film', 'starred', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'was', 'never', 'exactly', 'Disney', 'family', 'meant', 'be', 'obviously', 'copying', 'quot', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'quot', 'style', 'spawned', 'lot', 'copies', 'including', 'made-for-TV', 'remake', '1995', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'not', 'mention', 'string', 'late-80s', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Father', 'Son', 'quot', 'quot', '18', 'Again', 'quot', 'quot', 'Vice', 'Versa.', 'quot', 'were', 'different', 'variations', 'basic', 'premise', 'adults', 'switching', 'places', 'offspring', 'younger', 'relations', 'two', 'then', 'coming', 'appreciate', 'differences.Now', 'formula', 'seeing', 'steady', 'increase', 'popularity', 'once', 'again', '2002', 'quot', 'Hot', 'Chick', 'quot', 'one', 'worst', 'year', 'was', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'swapped', 'places', 'petty', 'criminal', 'Now', 'Disney', 'cashing', 'something', 'made', '20', 'odd', 'years', 'ago', 'one', 'included', 'expected', 'film', 'be', 'good', 'Surprise', 'surprise.Tess', 'Coleman', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'widowed', 'psychiatrist', 'two', 'kids', 'including', 'Anna', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', '15-year-old', 'highschooler', 'aspirations', 'punk', 'rock', 'status', 'friends', 'get', 'together', 'garage', 'house', 'quot', 'quot', 'play', 'guitar', 'first', 'time', 'quot', 'Back', 'Future', 'quot', 'filmmakers', 'put', 'effort', 'make', 'guitar', 'players', 'look', 'are', 'really', 'playing', 'darn', 'thing', 'quot', ""'re"", 'ruining', 'life', 'quot', 'Anna', 'constantly', 'Tess', 'engaged', 'boyfriend', 'Ryan', 'Mark', 'Harmon', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'two', 'attempts', 'being', 'nice', 'kids', 'often', 'Tess', 'Anna', 'bedroom', 'door', 'due', 'low', 'grades', 'Harmon', 'Anna', 'staircase', 'effort', 'make', 'peace', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'already', 'quot', 'When', 'mother', 'daughter', 'visit', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'eat', 'magical', 'fortune', 'cookies', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'always', 'expect', ""'re"", 'other', 'bodies.And', 'so', 'here', 'come', 'jokes', 'One', 'can', 'make', 'school', 'other', 'work', 'Tess', 'Anna', 'body', 'mature', 'adult', 'Meanwhile', 'Anna', 'Tess', 'body', 'teenager', 'even', 'makeover.But', 'there', ""'re"", 'problems', 'wedding', 'rock', 'band', 'audition', ""'re"", 'other', 'bodies', 'major', 'dilemma', 'want', 'switch', 'back', 'big', 'days', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'other', 'differences.What', 'delightful', 'little', 'family', 'film', 'Sweet', 'gentle', 'funny', 'just', 'plain', 'enjoyable', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'anything', ""n't"", 'process', 'lot', 'more', 'streaks', 'quot', 'Big', 'quot', 'quot', 'Vice', 'Versa.', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'Vice', 'Versa', 'quot', 'most', 'many', 'many', 'body-switching', '80s', 'films', 'released', 'simultaneously', 'now', ""'ve"", 'found', 'worthy', 'addition', 'genre.Annette', 'Bening', 'was', 'originally', 'cast', 'Tess', 'Coleman', 'then', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'stepped', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'Curtis', 'can', 'occasionally', 'be', 'quite', 'surprising', 'one', 'cases', 'Meanwhile', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'little', 'girl', '1998', 'remake', 'quot', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'quot', 'same', 'great', 'method', 'adult', 'channeling', 'little', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'did', 'quot', 'Vice', 'Versa.', 'quot', 'many', 'readers', 'probably', 'know', 'main', 'problem', 'quot', 'Big', 'quot', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'did', 'not', 'act', '13-year-old', 'rather', '6-year-old', 'Lohan', 'successfully', 'irritating', 'teenager', 'mature', 'adult', 'two', 'gals', 'performances', 'really', 'make', 'movie.This', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'treats', 'year', 'Kids', 'will', 'get', 'kick', 'so', 'will', 'parents', 'precisely', 'definition', 'great', 'family', 'filmmaking', 'let', 'face', 'Disney', 'lost', 'sight', 'few', 'years', 'ago', ""'re"", 'finally', 'getting', 'back', 'feet', 'long', 'dry', 'spot']",Freaky Friday

This is not a review of the special features or quality of the DVD, but only the film itself.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Disney released 3 gems this summer:1. Finding Nemo,2. Pirates of the Carribean3. Freak FridayThis film is a simply hilarious movie. It is so good for 3 reasons:1. Jamie Lee Curtis - She does such an amazing job when she's playing Hannah trapped in her mothers body I believe it really is Hannah.  It is a true joy watching Curtis really embody a teenager in a grown woman's body, it is fantastic!2. Lindsay Lohan - I had seen Lindsay Lohan in a couple movies, a remake of 'Parent Trap' and 'Get a Clue', a Disney channel movie. Although she was good, she'd yet to impress me, but she proves her ability as a comedic actress in this film, and is an equal match to Jamie Lee Curtis's physical comedy and zany antics.  When Lindsay plays the mom trapped in her daughters body she is absolutely fantastic and hilarious.3. The chemistry of the two leads; Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis play off each other wonderfully as mother and daughter. They have a very natural chemistry, and there are some great moments, to many to count really because this movie all togther is just hilarious. It doesn't feel contrived it feels natural and well paced.This is the perfect movie for mothers and their daughter(s). I saw it with my mom and we loved it. We so many parallels between us in this film.  Especially the seen where Hannah's mother tries to wake her up. :D  Its absolutely hilarious. Even if you're a boy.

616783,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JMCW,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[1, 1]","I am generally apprehensive regarding remakes because they are often inferior to the original. I avoided this movie in the theaters for that reason. Eventually we got the DVD and I gritted my teeth to watch. To my surprise the remake covers new territory in switch films and was quite enjoyable.As with the original, the interplay is between mother Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Annabell Coleman (Lindsay Lohan). However, in the original the daughter, played by Jodi Foster, was the stronger of the two roles and the mother just didn't quite spark my interest after the switch. In this movie both characters play well and Jamie Lee Curtis proves once again what a great actress she is.The best part of the movie is that the update is very modern. Annabell is faced with motorcycle riding hunks, is a member of a hard rock group, and wants to get more piercings. The character of Annabell is wonderfully rebellious yet not completely out of control.As with many teens, Annabell and her mother are arguing about something constantly. With a bit of Asian magic, and a rather tricky fortune cookie, mother and daughter switch bodies. The switch itself is hilarious. One of the scenes played in advertisements continuously is when Annabell, now in Tess' body, looks in the mirror and says that she's the Crypt Keeper. Jamie Lee Curtis is perfectly believable after the transition.We soon find that each really struggles with the other's world. Annabell can't keep up with all her mother's cell phones, PDA, and beeper. Further, driving seems to be quite a challenge for her. Tess discovers that her daughter was telling the truth about the English teacher who is continually out to get her, regardless of how well she does. It turns out that the English teacher and Tess know each other. Tess solves Annabell's problem quite nicely. However, Tess still has other problems, particularly with Annabell's friends. The peak of Tess' problems are during a rock audition that is very important to Annabell.There are additional conflicts for the pair to add even more spice. Tess is preparing to get married to Ryan (Mark Harmon), who is trying to understand his soon-to-be-daughter but, as with many fathers, is more than a little clueless. Annabell also has a younger brother that she sees as a pest. The switch allows candid conversations between Annabell and Ryan and Annabell and younger brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini) where Annabell learns that Ryan doesn't want to upset her life and truly wants to understand her and Harry loves her and admires her. The poignant moments are handled quite well with minimal schmaltz.The true point of the movie is for each to walk in the other's shoes.

It is funny and extremely well character developed.The story is that of a modern day mom and daughter who are opposites and at odds with each other. All mothers and daughters argue and in the heat of the moment may say things they really don&#65533;t mean at the time.  Through the mystical magic of an Asian Woman and a fortune cookie the mothers get the wish &#65533; they switch body&#65533;s and not for any particular time period &#65533; but they get to go back when they realize what their relationship is all about.It stars Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween, True Lies, House Arrest) in one of the best comedic performances in her career. She is so great with her timing and attitude &#65533; because she basically goes from being a middle-aged woman to a teenager. He use of the language, mannerism and her comic timing is perfect. Jamie is clever and inventive and took her performance to the top. She is hysterical in the real business world playing her mother- a Lawyer.Supported by Lindsay Lohan (Life Size, The Parent Trap) as her daughter who sharpens her performance as an overbearing, professional middle-aged women in a teenager&#65533;s body.They spend the remainder of the movie trying to figure out, very comically how to get back into each other&#65533;s original body.  Mark Harmon (Chicago Hope, Wyatt Earp) plays the sympathetic and confused fianc&eacute; for the recently divorced Jamie Lee. The little brother played by Ryan Malgarini (Gilmore Girls) gets caught in the middle and is hysterical in his confusion.This film is great fun for the whole family.

Tess embarrasses teenage Anna to no end and is so busy planning a wedding she doesn't realize her daughter is growing up.  Anna resents the new man in the family and wants to be treated as a grown-up, even if she's not responsible enough yet.Then one Friday, they wake up to discover they've been transported into each other's bodies.  Now Tess has to go to school and see what Anna's world is really like.  And Anna must act like a grown-up whether she wants to or not.  But can they figure out how to switch back before Tess walks down the aisle?I actually have never seen the original or read the book, but as soon as I heard about this movie, I had to see it because of Lindsay Lohan.  I became an instant fan with her work in ""The Parent Trap"" remake, and this movie impressed me even more.  She made playing a grown-up trapped in a teen's body completely believable.  Jamie Lee Curtis is equally wonderful as a grown-up who really isn't.  The supporting cast is wonderful as they try to coup with the weirdness going on around them that they can't possibly understand.  I laughed the entire way through the movie and choked up with tears at the end.  (I cry at the drop of a hat, what can I say?)The DVD is well worth buying.  Not only do you get the fun movie, but you get a few cool extras.  They have a deleted scene with director commentary (and he was right to delete it), and two alternative endings.  The bloopers reel was fun, as were the two music video's from the soundtrack.  There is a seven minute back stage featurette this is also worth checking out.  I would have loved to see an audio commentary or two, especially one including Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan, but it's not to be found.  The movie itself is presented in both widescreen and full frame formats, with a wonderful picture.

I enjoyed watching this umpteenth hundred take on the ""parent-child-switch-body-because-you-don't-understand-my-life-at-all"" concept.  What makes this film really work is the very impressive performances.  I will start with Lindsay Lohan, who I think convincingly embodies the parent role (the scene that shows her admonishing her ""friends,"" while also pulling down the blouse of one of the girls is hilarious!) while also expressing the angst of a young girl quite well.But the real joy and surprise of this film is the incredible performance of Jamie Lee Curtis. I wholeheartedly agree with the many critics who are saying that this work deserves consideration  by the Academy.  This is a performance worthy of at least an Oscar nod!!  Hold your lunch and your complaints skeptics and naysayers for just a second.  So often we equate good performances with dramatic scenes and histrionics.  Comedy is difficult--as many an actor has said, and physical comedy is even more difficult.  Curtis pulls this off with style, grace and comedic elan.  I truly believed she was a teenager!  As an example, watch the scene with Chad Michael Murray at the diner/hangout when they are discussing music--watch Curtis' body language.  This is good work people!!  I hope the Academy sees the value of this work just as they did Tom Hanks' in ""Big.""She truly deserves to be among the five nominated for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role.

616790,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JMCW,Matthew Horner,"[5, 6]","""Freaky Friday"", a remake of a 1976 film starring Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster, was on my list of movies to avoid when it came out in the summer of 2003 - too cute, too predictable, too formula, etc. As it turns out, though, it's rather good and often quite funny, thanks in large part to Jamie Lee Curtis' over-the-top performance and to Mark L. Waters' fairly sophisticated direction. Its target audience is girls aged ten to sixteen, but it is a movie adults can also enjoy.This is the story of Tess [Curtis] and her teen daughter, Annabell [Lindsay Lohman]. Tess is about to remarry and Annabell is in the rebellious stage. The tension between the two, as well as between Annabell and her kid brother, seems rather typical. One night at a Chinese restaurant an old woman casts a spell on mother and daughter. The next morning each wakes up in the other's body. They spend a `freaky' - and hilarious - Friday, each experiencing what life is like for the other. Tess has to go to Annabell's high school, and Annabell must go off to her mother's office. Each must put up with the other one's boy friend. Kid brother, of course, doesn't know which end is up.Like most movies of its type, ""Freaky Friday"" sometimes runs perilously close to the schmaltzy and the sentimental, but each time it does, a funny line or physical action pulls it back from the edge. Again, much of this is due to Ms. Curtis, who is one of our funniest, cleverest, and most underrated actresses. I doubt we'll be seeing her name on Oscar's list of Best Actress nominees, and that's a pity.

I've been where Lindsay Lohan's character was with her on-screen mum, Jamie Lee Curtis. Tell me a teenage daughter who hasn't slammed her bedroom door in protest (and had it removed), yelled at her little brother, not liked her soon to be step-dad, not got on a motorbike because her mother wouldn't have liked it, turns her music up loud, belongs to a rock group, yet pierces her bellybutton without her mother's knowledge.After watching this, I was on such a high afterwards. I loved the music (I'm getting into that loud music phase now, after my years of cheesy pop, so much so, that my mum had to go upstairs when I was watching this, due to the noise!), Jamie Lee Curtis &amp; Lindsay Lohan actually COULD have been mother and daughter (great casting), and on the whole, the movie was great.I haven't watched a 'Walt Disney movie' since I was young, so watching this, and now actually owning a non-ANIMATION (it's called a cartoon) movie by them is great.When Anna and Tess swap minds almost it's so funny! And what happens afterwards, made me appreciate my mum even more - although she hasn't had to put up with me smoking, drinking on street corners, and sleeping with any guy who takes an interest. At least that's something! Unfortunately, I couldn't persuade her to watch this. She doesn't know what's good for her. The way Jamie Lee Curtis manages to change her image - or the way Anna changes her mother's image - is amazing, although I preferred her with the slightly longer hair.The extras are your average, run of the mill DVD extras to be honest.

616795,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00005JMCW,Michael Butts,"[1, 2]","FREAKY FRIDAY is a movie of revelations.  First, we have the breakout performance for an actress who has always done well, but in this movie, well she finds her niche.  Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely delightful in the role of Tess Coleman.  She brings a comic ability hardly evidenced in her earlier films; she also has the maturity to cut loose and play her teenage daughter with all the stops pulled out.  If this was a perfect world, Jamie Lee would find herself with a Best Actress oscar nomination this year.  Likewise, Ms. Lindsay Lohan---incredible performance, going from the self-centered teenybopper to the more sophisticated and mature personage of her stressed out mom.Lohan and Curtis work brilliantly together, and in this same perfect world, Lindsay would also be Oscar nominated.Director Mark Waters kept things moving at a frenetic pace, and had me chuckling throughout the movie.  We can't overlook, either, the wonderful actors in their supporting roles:  Mark Harmon was his usual stuffy self, but there was innate warmth lurking there, too; Harold Gould was charming as the hard of hearing grandfather; Ryan Malgarini was perfect as the brother from hell; Dina Spybey was perfect as the too perfect classmate, Stacey; and my favorites:  Rosalind Chao and Lucille Soong as the Chinese ladies who get the ball rolling with the switching.  They are so full of life, they give the movie incredible bursts of fun and humor.  Ironically, Chad Michael Murray worked best in his scenes with Jamie Lee; he seemed to have more maturity and self-confidence.This is a very entertaining movie, and in its own way, much better than the original.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND OSCAR DON'T BE SUCH A STUFFSHIRT!",5,SWITCHEROONIE,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,1708,"['FREAKY', 'FRIDAY', 'movie', 'revelations', 'First', 'have', 'breakout', 'performance', 'actress', 'who', 'always', 'done', 'well', 'movie', 'well', 'niche', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'role', 'Tess', 'Coleman', 'comic', 'ability', 'hardly', 'evidenced', 'earlier', 'films', 'also', 'maturity', 'cut', 'loose', 'play', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'stops', 'pulled', 'out', 'was', 'perfect', 'world', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'would', 'find', 'Best', 'Actress', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'year', 'Likewise', 'Ms.', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', '-incredible', 'performance', 'going', 'self-centered', 'teenybopper', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'mature', 'personage', 'stressed', 'out', 'mom.Lohan', 'Curtis', 'work', 'brilliantly', 'together', 'same', 'perfect', 'world', 'Lindsay', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'Oscar', 'nominated.Director', 'Mark', 'Waters', 'kept', 'things', 'moving', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'had', 'chuckling', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'either', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'was', 'usual', 'stuffy', 'self', 'there', 'was', 'innate', 'warmth', 'lurking', 'there', 'too', 'Harold', 'Gould', 'was', 'charming', 'hard', 'hearing', 'grandfather', 'Ryan', 'Malgarini', 'was', 'perfect', 'brother', 'hell', 'Dina', 'Spybey', 'was', 'perfect', 'too', 'perfect', 'classmate', 'Stacey', 'favorites', 'Rosalind', 'Chao', 'Lucille', 'Soong', 'Chinese', 'ladies', 'who', 'get', 'ball', 'rolling', 'switching', 'are', 'so', 'full', 'life', 'give', 'movie', 'incredible', 'bursts', 'fun', 'humor', 'Ironically', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'worked', 'best', 'scenes', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'seemed', 'have', 'more', 'maturity', 'self-confidence.This', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'own', 'way', 'much', 'better', 'original.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'AND', 'OSCAR', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'BE', 'SUCH', 'STUFFSHIRT']",Freaky Friday
616796,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JMCW,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[2, 4]","Neo who? 2003 was expected to be the year of The Matrix but has surprisingly become the year of The Mouse. The Walt Disney Company, who last summer was groveling over constant movie problems, has surpassed all other studios by becoming the first to cross the coveted $1 billion mark this year thanks in part to the leggy duo of Finding Nemo and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Disney hopes to continue its winning streak by digging through their archives and remaking a classic film for a new generation. Freaky Friday, which originally starred Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster back in 1977, hopes to join the ranks of other girl oriented Disney comedies like The Princess Diaries and The Parent Trap, which also starred Lindsay Lohan. The only thing going against the film is the fact that it is a remake. Walt Disney Pictures does not have a great success rate for their remakes with films like Flubber and That Darn Cat flopping at the box office. And things didn't go too well for the original Freaky Friday back when it first opened in 1977. The good word on the film didn't get around until late in its run and by then it was all too late. Freaky Friday hopes to defy past history and present a delightful film for teenage girls; a thing the box office has lacked a lot this year. But will the girls flock to the film or will history repeat itself?The story centers on the conflicting relationship between Dr. Tess Coleman and her daughter, Anna. Anna is just another typical fifteen year old teenager who enjoys rock music, plays in a garage band, and drives her mother crazy over her hair, clothes, and problems at school. Tess has enough to worry about with her rising career and her upcoming wedding. But one night while the whole family is dining at a Chinese restaurant things boil over. Anna is totally infuriated that her mother doesn't agree with her musical aspirations and Tess is at wits end trying to get Anna to recognize how good of a man her future husband is. When the two crack open their fortune cookies and read the pieces of paper inside, something mysterious happens the next morning. Anna wakes up in Tess' body and Tess wakes up in Anna's body. The two live each other's lives for one day going through all the problems they never imagined the other had as they try to find a solution to their predicament. Whatever has to be done must be done quickly as Tess is set to marry her boyfriend the next day! The story for Freaky Friday does a great job at modernizing the classic body switching tale for a new generation though several elements of the new script end up getting lost within the course of the two hour feature. The conflict between Anna's former friend who is now a cheerleader was just another typical ""Cheerleaders are evil"" story element most teen comedies and/or dramas seem to have but wasn't really necessary for this film.The cast for the remake of Freaky Friday was surprisingly more memorable then that of the original film. Jamie Lee Curtis, who is best known for her roles in True Lies and the Halloween series, is absolutely amazing as Tess Coleman. She plays the frantic mother role down pat and slips very well into the role of a teenage girl trapped in a grown woman's body. Lindsay Lohan, who also starred another Disney remake, The Parent Trap, does a very good job in the role of Anna Coleman and shows that she is really maturing in her style of acting. The scenes where Tess is in the body of Anna are less comedic then the scenes with Jamie Lee Curtis acting like a teenager but maybe the fact the audience knows its Jamie Lee Curtis makes it that way. Mark Harmon is pretty good as Tess' future husband but he isn't featured as much as he should have been. His character is shown struggling trying to connect with Anna in only a scene or two and doesn't show much conflict as more there was more of a focus on the relationship between Tess and Anna. Chad Murrary plays another typical high school guy who looks bad but is actually good at heart that is seen in every other teen comedy/drama and does nothing outside the ordinary here.Overall, Freaky Friday is another teen oriented comedy which can be both good and bad. Most of the problems with the film seem to be that many of the elements that are typical in a teen comedy/drama are no different here. Such elements as ""cheerleaders are evil"", ""the bad boy is good at heart"" and ""some teachers are out to get certain children"" got pretty annoying after awhile and weren't needed is this feature. Then there were the scenes that show Jake (Chad Murray) becoming fascinated with Anna's mother. Granted they were trying to show that Jake was interested in Anna's mind and personality that was trapped in Tess' body but it still comes out as just creepy and wrong especially when he sings ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" outside their house. And as hilarious as the film was in many instances, the overall feeling was that the film resorted to too much slap stick humor. Certainly the film didn't have to lower itself to that level that much to be entertaining. Outside of those problems, the film was quite entertaining though not on the same level as comedies like Anger Management, Bruce Almighty, and American Wedding. If you are a teenage girl searching for an entertaining film outside of the ""blow `em up"" action flicks the box office seems to be cluttered with then certainly Freaky Friday is the film for you. If not, stick with Pirates of the Caribbean or American Wedding until the next gross out comedy or action flick opens in a few weeks.",3,The Moose Hole - Jamie Lee Curtis is 'Freaky',1072656000,"12

We'd been bickering one afternoon, and he went to his room to get away from me.  This movie came on the TV.  I watched the first 5 minutes and thought it was so perfectly humorous, I called my son in to watch it.  We both loved it.  The themes between a teenage girl & her mom can apply in some respects to what a teenage son and his mom experience.  My son & I both have to see good acting for a movie to truly appeal to us, this has it.  Lindsay Lohan's partying ways in her personal life overshadow her acting abilities, but with the right roles, she's great, and she flawlessly pulls this role off.

This ninety minute film I believe is a remake of an earlier Disney film.  A busy psychiatrist and widowed mom, Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis), and her musical teenage honor student daughter, Anna (Lindsay Lohan), turn squabbling into an Olympic event.  On the verge of remarrying Tess has a heart to heart talk with Anna in a Chinese restaurant about her recent behavior in school.  In order for each to learn how the other lives a Chinese woman gives them each a fortune cookie which causes them to switch bodies.  So for one freaky Friday the two have to masquerade as each other.  Tess finds out that being a modern teenager isn't as easy as she thought.  Anna finds out that her mother's life isn't as perfect as it seems.  Only selfless love can change the two back.  Mother and daughter grow in love and admiration.

The story is about an engaged-widowed-working mother who is constantly bickering with her funky-opinionated-guitar-playing teenage daughter. An older chinese woman sees the two fighting and decides to interject by putting a curse on them which causes them to switch places. When they wake up in the morning, the daughter is in the mothers body and the mother is in the daughters body. They have to try to go about eachothers day without bringing notice to anyone else that anything has changed all while trying to figure out how to get back to their original bodies - and they have to do so soon - the mother is set to get re-married the next day and the daughter is scheduled for a pivitol band audition.

Unfortunately this switch occurs two days before the mother's wedding and the day before her daughter has a major honors test at school.

But when a freak ""accident"" befalls them, causing each of them to wind up in the other's body, both are forced to see things from the other person's perspective.  This sort of one-joke setup could easily have resulted in a mechanical, manufactured comedy, but writers Heather Hach and Leslie Dixon, along with director Mark Waters, have decided to have some real fun with the premise by devising clever scenarios that bend the mind a little and by building a surprising amount of depth into the two lead characters.  We learn quite a bit about how each generation views the other in the course of all the highflying antics.This film is a real tour de force for the two actresses, especially Curtis, who never falters for a moment in her characterization of a bratty teenager trapped in a middle-aged woman's body.  Loman has the less challenging - and less fun - job of portraying her opposite number, but she still delivers a performance of tremendous charm and substance.""Freaky Friday"" may not be original, but it provides more laugh-out-loud moments than virtually any comedy released in 2003.",3,highflying remake,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,1428,"['Freaky', 'Friday', 'fun', 'high-spirited', 'remake', '1976', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'served', 'ground', 'zero', 'body-switch', 'movie', 'craze', ""1980's.Jamie"", 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Lindsay', 'Loman', 'are', 'terrific', 'mother', 'daughter', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'eye-to-eye', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'least', 'how', 'other', 'should', 'be', 'living', 'life', 'when', 'freak', 'accident', 'causing', 'wind', 'up', 'other', 'body', 'are', 'forced', 'see', 'things', 'other', 'person', 'perspective', 'sort', 'one-joke', 'setup', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'resulted', 'mechanical', 'manufactured', 'comedy', 'writers', 'Heather', 'Hach', 'Leslie', 'Dixon', 'director', 'Mark', 'Waters', 'have', 'decided', 'have', 'real', 'fun', 'premise', 'devising', 'clever', 'scenarios', 'bend', 'mind', 'little', 'building', 'surprising', 'amount', 'depth', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'learn', 'quite', 'bit', 'how', 'generation', 'other', 'course', 'highflying', 'antics.This', 'film', 'real', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'two', 'actresses', 'especially', 'Curtis', 'who', 'never', 'falters', 'moment', 'characterization', 'bratty', 'teenager', 'trapped', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'body', 'Loman', 'less', 'challenging', 'less', 'fun', 'job', 'portraying', 'opposite', 'number', 'still', 'performance', 'tremendous', 'charm', 'substance', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'original', 'more', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'virtually', 'comedy', 'released', '2003']",Freaky Friday

It's a remake of a 1976 movie of the same name with Jodie Foster (also by Disney), but is one of the few remakes that easily outdo the original. It is no milestone in filmaking, but in a season chock-full of action movie sequels, and minimal creative products from a panicked studio system that is going through another period of zero originality, this is a blast of a release!Yes, the theme is a slightly 70s doozie: body switching. But don't let that fool you into skipping this (as it did me) because the direction is sharp, not heavy handed. No special effects, great writing, crisp dialogue, just a plain fun movie, like the studios cranked out for decades, before they became what they are today. Curtis as usual is simply charming, she IS every bit the mother/daughter, and Linsday Lohan has a great presence.It's straight family entertainment and generally likely to tickle everyone's fancies.

616818,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00005JMCW,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[4, 4]","I had a lot of fun watching Disney's remake of Freaky Friday. In some ways this updated version improves on the themes of the original 1970's version. Funny and smart, Disney's Freaky Friday makes a great date movie or a great family movie.The story follows a family days before a widow's wedding to her new fianc&eacute;. Daughter and mother are at odds with each other over the upcoming nuptials A trip to the Chinese restaurant and a fortune cookie lead to daughter and mother switching bodies and experiencing each other's lives. It's only when they come to appreciate each other that things change back. I know I'm leaving a lot out; (I usually write detailed synopses in my reviews) but I really want people to watch this movie and experience it for themselves. Disney's Freaky Friday is JUST TOO GOOD TO SPOILThis movie is a lot of fun; the jokes are hilarious and the music is great. My favorite scenes are the collision in the bedroom between Anna and her Mother. I also liked the talk show sequence and the scenes in the car with some McDonald's fries (I can relate.) Really funny stuff. The updated script is well written and the cinematography is solid.Disney did a great job of casting their version of Freaky Friday. Each actor and actress is perfectly cast in their roles. Lindsay Lohan gives a strong performance as Anna. For a young actress she handles the dual role very well, making both a convincing teenager and middle aged woman trapped in a teenage body. Jamie Lee Curtis is hilarious in this movie. Her performance here is worth the purchase of the DVD alone; the way she transitions from middle aged woman to hot teenager trapped in a middle aged woman's body are incredible. Her scenes with Chad Michael Murray made the movie for me. I could actually feel the chemistry swirling between them. She needs to be in more movies; I love watching her perform. Chad Michael Murray is in top form here as Anna's love interest. They need to let him do more on One Tree Hill. Veteran actor Harold Gould gets some great lines in some key scenes. Mark Harmon (NCIS) is a surprise as the mom's love interest. Nice to see him playing something light and funny for once. Look for Christina Vidal as Anna's bandmate.Both versions of Freaky Friday are Shawn James five star Essential Movies. After almost 30 years the story is on its way to becoming a modern classic. While you're buying this one pick up the original 1970's version and the great book both movies are based on.",5,Freaky Friday is freaky fun!

Waters' modern-day remake of ""Freaky Friday"" has got to be one of the more pleasant surprises of recent memory as it turns out to be filled with more fun and wit than anyone would have expected.  It is proof positive that what worked before can work again if done with the proper amount of care and creativity.Psychiatrist Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) has her hands full preparing for her upcoming wedding.  Not making matters easier for Tess is her rebellious daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) who is having difficulties at school and is not too excited at the prospect of having a new father in her life.  After the two of them get into a fight at a Chinese Restaurant, they are each given a fortune cookie by an elderly Chinese woman (Lucille Soong).  Mother and daughter both read their fortune and express amusement, but the joke is on them as they wake up the next morning and find themselves in the other's body.""Freaky Friday"" works because its two central performances are so strong.  Curtis hits all the right notes in a great comedic turn and Lohan sparkles in a winning performance that is reminiscent of her previous solid work in ""The Parent Trap"" (1998).  Lohan proves to be the most charming young actress working today as she energizes every scene she appears in by radiating a natural charm that is wonderfully endearing.  Both actresses are supported by a clever script and quality work from actors Ryan Malgarini, Mark Harmon, Harold Gould, and Chad Murray.  The only problems with the film are its weak soundtrack and the unflattering stereotypical portrayals of the Chinese women. Yet, Curtis and Lohan are so good that they help to elevate ""Freaky Friday"" above its shortcomings.  Those magical, unsolicited fortune cookies sure are good for a lot of fun moments when given to the right people.",3,"""I can't marry Ryan, ewwwww.""",1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,1897,"['Who', 'knew', 'was', 'still', 'life', 'left', 'body-switch', 'film', 'Mark', 'S.', 'Waters', 'modern-day', 'remake', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'recent', 'memory', 'out', 'be', 'filled', 'more', 'fun', 'wit', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'proof', 'positive', 'what', 'worked', 'can', 'work', 'again', 'done', 'proper', 'amount', 'care', 'creativity.Psychiatrist', 'Tess', 'Coleman', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'hands', 'full', 'preparing', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'Not', 'making', 'matters', 'easier', 'Tess', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'who', 'having', 'difficulties', 'school', 'not', 'too', 'excited', 'prospect', 'having', 'new', 'father', 'life', 'two', 'get', 'fight', 'Chinese', 'Restaurant', 'are', 'given', 'fortune', 'cookie', 'elderly', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'Lucille', 'Soong', 'Mother', 'daughter', 'read', 'fortune', 'express', 'amusement', 'joke', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'find', 'other', 'body', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'two', 'central', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'Curtis', 'right', 'notes', 'great', 'comedic', 'turn', 'Lohan', 'sparkles', 'winning', 'performance', 'reminiscent', 'previous', 'solid', 'work', 'Parent', 'Trap', '1998', 'Lohan', 'be', 'most', 'charming', 'young', 'actress', 'working', 'today', 'scene', 'radiating', 'natural', 'charm', 'wonderfully', 'endearing', 'actresses', 'are', 'supported', 'clever', 'script', 'quality', 'work', 'actors', 'Ryan', 'Malgarini', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'Harold', 'Gould', 'Chad', 'Murray', 'only', 'problems', 'film', 'are', 'weak', 'soundtrack', 'unflattering', 'stereotypical', 'portrayals', 'Chinese', 'women', 'Curtis', 'Lohan', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'help', 'elevate', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'shortcomings', 'magical', 'unsolicited', 'fortune', 'cookies', 'sure', 'are', 'good', 'lot', 'fun', 'moments', 'when', 'given', 'right', 'people']",Freaky Friday

616830,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMCW,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","This is the remake of the 1977 original starring one child star Jodie Foster.  Anyone who said remakes stink should reconsider his idea, for the newer &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; is one of the delightful family pictures Disney gave us in this decade.The body-switching story is simple enough.  Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) is an upright and principled psychatrist (and widow) who is busy preparing for the coming marriage, and her daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) is a high school student who wants to have a date with a boy, play rock music; in short, she needs a little bit more freedom.Then, at a Chinese restaurant, they embarrasingly argue in front of the mother's love Ryan (Mark Harmon).  And then, the owner of the place offers a pair of fortune cookie, which, believe it or mot, have a magical power to change the roles of mother and daughter.  Tess is in Anna's body, and Anna in Tess's.We know where &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; will lead you eventually, so let's wait for the film to be better and funnier as it goes on.  The first 20 minutes may look too banal, following the storyline of typical family pictures (a kid in detention class, mother worrying about her, and so on ...), but that is exactly the point.  After their bodies are switched, the things get wild, crazy, and funny ... probably more funnier than you expect.That is all because of the two great leading ladies -- Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan (the latter played the double roles in &quot;The Parent Trap,&quot; another good remake).  The way Lee Curtis changes the make-up (in the punk fashion, of course) and takes over the TV show with comic talk is one of the many highlights of the film.  With her, Lohan always gives an amusing contrast as a rebellous daughter, then a dutiful one.  (The only reason I do not give five stars is Chinese restaurant setting which looks trite to me -- and I didn't want to see Rosalind Chao in this way -- and its slightly weaker supporting actors).And most of all, what is great about the film is that Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are not only great talents but also they are having fun doing what they can do.  And this fun is very contagious -- the kind of fun we can all share.",4,Changing Bodies (with Your Daughter): Delightful Family Pic,1084838400,"05 18, 2004",2004,2205,"['remake', '1977', 'original', 'starring', 'one', 'child', 'star', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Anyone', 'who', 'said', 'remakes', 'stink', 'should', 'reconsider', 'idea', 'newer', 'quot', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'quot', 'one', 'delightful', 'family', 'Disney', 'gave', 'decade.The', 'body-switching', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'Tess', 'Coleman', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'upright', 'principled', 'psychatrist', 'widow', 'who', 'busy', 'preparing', 'coming', 'marriage', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'have', 'date', 'boy', 'play', 'rock', 'music', 'short', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'freedom.Then', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'embarrasingly', 'argue', 'front', 'mother', 'love', 'Ryan', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'then', 'owner', 'place', 'pair', 'fortune', 'cookie', 'believe', 'mot', 'have', 'magical', 'power', 'change', 'roles', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Tess', 'Anna', 'body', 'Anna', ""Tess's.We"", 'know', 'where', 'quot', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'quot', 'will', 'lead', 'eventually', 'let', 'wait', 'film', 'be', 'better', 'funnier', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'may', 'look', 'too', 'banal', 'following', 'storyline', 'typical', 'family', 'pictures', 'kid', 'detention', 'class', 'mother', 'worrying', 'so', 'exactly', 'point', 'bodies', 'are', 'switched', 'things', 'get', 'wild', 'crazy', 'funny', 'probably', 'more', 'funnier', 'expect.That', 'two', 'great', 'leading', 'ladies', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'latter', 'played', 'double', 'roles', 'quot', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'quot', 'good', 'remake', 'way', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'make-up', 'punk', 'fashion', 'course', 'TV', 'show', 'comic', 'talk', 'one', 'many', 'highlights', 'film', 'Lohan', 'always', 'amusing', 'contrast', 'rebellous', 'daughter', 'then', 'dutiful', 'one', 'only', 'reason', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'setting', 'trite', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Rosalind', 'Chao', 'way', 'slightly', 'weaker', 'supporting', 'actors', '.And', 'most', 'what', 'great', 'film', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'talents', 'also', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'doing', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'fun', 'very', 'contagious', 'kind', 'fun', 'can', 'share']",Freaky Friday
616831,A1WL2EKE4TAEJP,B00005JMCW,"Tyler Durden ""Mutton Man""","[1, 1]","""Freaky Friday"" completely revived the ol' ""switcheroo"" genre, only it does it better and is completely more believable. And not only is it more believable, it's actually funny. Not only is it funny, it's just downright funnier than 90% of the garbage out there that passes for a comedy.The plot snypnosis is quite easy. Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) is the mother, who is a psychiatrist at work, continuously bugged by her phone and pagers going off every minute, readying for a big wedding, and having it rough trying to communicate with her daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan). Anna on the other hand has her share of problems, with a teacher that's failing her for no reason, a friend-turned-bully tormenting her, her obnoxious lil' bro bugging her, not getting along with her mother's fiance, trying oh so desperately to gain attention of the cute guy she adores, and exclaiming her mother is ""ruining her life"" and a ""fun-sucker"" (""sucking the fun out of everything""). Not one understands what goes on in their lives, so they fight and argue constantly. Mother plays psychiatrist to her rebellious daughter to try and understand, but daughter says mom just doesn't understand.At a resteraunt, they argue again, but then an elderly Chinese woman interferes with their conflict and decides to try and resolve the issue... by giving them fortune cookies. ""Magic"" fortune cookies, to explain better. Both eat them, and thus begins their most unusual experience of their lifetime. They wake up shocked to find their bodies switched. They try to resolve the issue by a ""jolt"" (running into each other). Unfortunately, they can't fix the problem and try to live out the day as trying to be each other.The result is nothing short of hilarious. Jamie, pretending to be the rebellious teenage girl, completely steals the movie. It's just so funny to see her acting like a teenage girl. When the cute boy Anna likes comes up, Jamie says, ""Oh my God..."" like how a teenage girl would say. She pulls it off so well, you'll just laugh out loud (her saying ""Eww!"" is priceless). Lindsay is also hilarious as being serious and a little Miss Perfect.Naturally they understand how each other's lives are. They manage to make solve each other's problems and pull off the day as being each other. Sure, it sounds cliched, but how else can it be done? ""Freaky Friday"" is by far one of the best comedies of recent times. The movie pulls off more laughs than a comedy that relies on gross-out or sexual humor.Buy it, be entertained, and laugh out loud.",4,"My review of ""Freaky Friday"".. sorry if it's not good",1102723200,"12 11, 2004",2004,2523,"['Freaky', 'Friday', 'completely', 'revived', 'ol', 'switcheroo', 'genre', 'only', 'better', 'completely', 'more', 'believable', 'not', 'only', 'more', 'believable', 'actually', 'funny', 'Not', 'only', 'funny', 'just', 'downright', 'funnier', '90', '%', 'garbage', 'there', 'comedy.The', 'plot', 'snypnosis', 'quite', 'easy', 'Tess', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'mother', 'who', 'psychiatrist', 'work', 'continuously', 'bugged', 'phone', 'pagers', 'going', 'off', 'minute', 'readying', 'big', 'wedding', 'having', 'rough', 'trying', 'communicate', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Anna', 'other', 'hand', 'share', 'problems', 'teacher', 'failing', 'reason', 'friend-turned-bully', 'tormenting', 'obnoxious', 'lil', 'bro', 'bugging', 'not', 'getting', 'along', 'mother', 'fiance', 'trying', 'oh', 'so', 'desperately', 'gain', 'attention', 'cute', 'guy', 'exclaiming', 'mother', 'ruining', 'life', 'fun-sucker', 'sucking', 'fun', 'everything', 'Not', 'one', 'lives', 'fight', 'argue', 'constantly', 'Mother', 'psychiatrist', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'try', 'understand', 'daughter', 'mom', 'just', ""n't"", 'understand.At', 'resteraunt', 'argue', 'again', 'then', 'elderly', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'conflict', 'decides', 'try', 'resolve', 'issue', 'giving', 'fortune', 'cookies', 'Magic', 'fortune', 'cookies', 'explain', 'better', 'eat', 'thus', 'most', 'unusual', 'experience', 'lifetime', 'wake', 'up', 'shocked', 'find', 'bodies', 'switched', 'try', 'resolve', 'issue', 'jolt', 'running', 'other', 'Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fix', 'problem', 'try', 'live', 'out', 'day', 'trying', 'be', 'other.The', 'result', 'nothing', 'short', 'hilarious', 'Jamie', 'pretending', 'be', 'rebellious', 'teenage', 'girl', 'completely', 'movie', 'just', 'so', 'funny', 'see', 'acting', 'teenage', 'girl', 'When', 'cute', 'boy', 'Anna', 'up', 'Jamie', 'Oh', 'God', 'how', 'teenage', 'girl', 'would', 'say', 'off', 'so', 'well', ""'ll"", 'just', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'saying', 'Eww', 'priceless', 'Lindsay', 'also', 'hilarious', 'being', 'serious', 'little', 'Miss', 'Perfect.Naturally', 'understand', 'how', 'other', 'lives', 'are', 'manage', 'make', 'solve', 'other', 'problems', 'pull', 'off', 'day', 'being', 'other', 'Sure', 'cliched', 'how', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'recent', 'times', 'movie', 'more', 'laughs', 'comedy', 'gross-out', 'sexual', 'humor.Buy', 'be', 'entertained', 'out', 'loud']",Freaky Friday

Mother (Jamie Lee Curtis) and teenage daughter (Lindsay Lohan) are at each others' throats, all day every day. Through magical means, each spends a day living the other's life. They reach a new understanding of each other in a tearful rapprochement, and everyone ends up back where they belong. The end. (The fact that Curtis's character was a therapist and had so little respect or understanding to start with makes me think of shoemakers' children going barefoot, but we'll let that slide.)If you have a couple of hours to kill, that much offers a merciful way to euthanize them. What lifts this movie above banality is the physical comedy that both lead actresses bring to the show. Lohan has a few good moments, including some motherly primping of her daughter, Curtis. Her best is the ""That's not mine!"" sequence when the mother wakes up inside her of her daughter and takes inventory of the unfamiliar body parts. It really isn't a memorable performance, though. That's OK, because Curtis more than makes up for it. She manages all the teenish petulance and gawkiness you could want, channeling not only her own inner child but a few other people's as well. It's a role you simply have to see. Writing about it would be like explaining a joke. It might get the point across, but only at the cost of everything that makes it worthwhile.It's family-safe and amusing.
