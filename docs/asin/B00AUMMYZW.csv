1616908,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00AUMMYZW,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","The Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship (DoSAC) is a key government body with wide-ranging responsibilities on a number of different issues. However, the minister in charge of the department is constrained, bewildered and kept on the hop by a prime minister who can't go five minutes without changing his mind and by a variety of mishaps. Luckily, the party's chief spin-doctor Malcolm Tucker is on hand to keep them on-track with a barrage of swearing and formidable powers of media manipulation.The Thick of It is a British drama-comedy that aired for four seasons and two hour-long specials, irregularly scheduled between 2005 and 2012. It was created by political satirist and comedian Armando Iannucci and has a constantly-evolving cast and scope. The first two seasons (of just three episodes each) are tightly focused on DoSAC minister Hugh Abbot (Chris Langham), his advisors Ollie Reeder (Chris Addison) and Glen Cullen (James Smith), his director of communications Terri Coverley (Joanna Scanlan) and, of course, the formidable Malcolm Tucker (a masterful performance by Peter Capaldi). The success of the early episodes opened up the scale of the show and more castmembers were added, including the shadow DoSAC department run by the opposition party and led by Peter Mannion (Roger Allam). Langham's departure under controversial, off-screen circumstances led to his replacement by Nicola Murray (Rebecca Front), a backbencher so obscure that even the detail-oriented Tucker doesn't know who she is.The Thick of It is filmed with handheld cameras to give a semi-documentary, urgent feel to events and much of the dialogue is improvised to help with this feeling, although  there is a script which acts a guide. The show makes a point of never saying which party which character works for, although it's quite clear that the party in government in the first three seasons is Labour and the coalition in the final season is between the Tories and Liberal Democrats. Notably, the final season posits an alternate reality where David Miliband ('Daniel Miller') takes over as Labour leader and is immediately regarded as a key threat by his opponents.The show is mostly comedic, with early storylines revolving around the incompetence of the minister and his staff, usually creating a PR catastrophe that Tucker has to solve through the use of clever media tactics and chewing out the team with a spectacular eruption of creative and sustained invective. This format starts to tire a little, but the show seems aware of this and changes things up, featuring episodes more revolving around political conspiracies and internal power struggles. The final season features a change of focus, with the opposition now in power and Tucker (after a monumental battle for his career in the third season) consigned to helping guide his party back into power. The show also features moments of drama and pathos, most notably revolving around Tucker's undermining in the third season and a more serious subplot in the final season about the death of a nurse and how the parties seek to cynically use it for their own ends.Most of the plaudits bestowed on The Thick of It are well-deserved. The acting is excellent from everyone, although it has to be said that both Capaldi and Roger Allam (whose compromised but well-meaning code of honour makes him the most likable character on the show, which isn't saying much) rise above the pack. The dialogue, whether scripted or improvised, is sharp and quickly-delivered and the storylines are fairly intricate. Events often spin on a single line of dialogue or an innocuous-looking phone call that backfires later on, so some attention to detail is required.If the show has a weakness, it's that the constant tone of cynicism can at times be wearying. Yes, politics is a dirty game and even the most well-meaning, idealistic young politician probably does become despairing and sarcastic about the whole thing after a few years, but the near-total absence of any sympathetic characters (particularly in the final season, when everyone really is out for themselves) feels like it's going overboard. The constant level of incompetence from the characters also feels a little unbelievable after a while, with it being implausible that these characters could keep their jobs after even one of the 'omnishambles' that takes place, let alone dozens. Veep (made by such the same team), which can be seen as an American mirror to The Thick of It, handles this rather better by showing some of the characters to be at least basically competent in their roles and the disasters not being quite as catastrophic.Still, these issues are made up for the sharp humour and extremely strong performances. The Thick of It (****) is the strongest British political comedy since Yes, Minister and is unrelenting in its mockery of some very silly institutions that nevertheless control the country. The series is available on DVD in the UK and USA now.",5,Sharply-written with some superb performances,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,4978,"['Department', 'Social', 'Affairs', 'Citizenship', 'DoSAC',

1616913,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B00AUMMYZW,K. Boullosa,"[1, 1]","I can't say much more about this superlative, black political satire from Britain that other reviewers haven't already said about this alleged behind the scenes look at the UK government's ""Department of Social Affairs"".  The fairly brief episodes revolve around the miseries and predicaments of the Minister for Social Affairs and his/her hapless staff, particularly its PR machine. There are actually two Ministries for Social Affairs: one for the party in power and the other the ""shadow"" version. Americans may get confused by this if they don't know that in the UK, the ""opposition"" party, the one NOT In power, forms a cabinet that mirrors, or ""shadows"" the cabinet of the party in power - thus, the ""shadow cabinet"" and ""shadow ministers"".  It's not hard to figure out which office/cast members are parodying the Liberal/Labour and which the Tory/Conservatives. Equally mendacious, feckless, and amoral, one of the not too subtle points of the show is that it hardly matters which is in power.The cast is wonderful and, like spokes of a wheel, spin around the Senior Press Officer for the majority party, the notorious Malcolm Tucker: vicious, ruthless, terrifying, and ruling all and sundry with levels of profanity so coarse as to beggar description. Even in more sophisticated Europe, it pulls one up short as you listen to remember that the nearly incessant stream of obscenity that forms the great portion of the writing made it onto mainstream programming.Tucker is played by the delightful Peter Capaldi, who makes the most of every oath-filled moment. The heart goes out to the rest of the characters trying to share a screen, even a small one, with Capaldi's no-holds-barred Tucker.I bought this disc and found it to be a Region 1, so if you have US DVD player you should be able to play it, and it does contain ""Rise of the Nutters"" and all the specials.I cracked a couple of ribs laughing as I watched this, but it's just as well that the episodes are less than a half hour each: it's just about as much at a time as anyone can take of Malcolm Tucker's mouth.The film ""In the Loop"", with many of the same cast members, including Capaldi, was based on this series.

1616914,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00AUMMYZW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[14, 14]","The British political satire ""The Thick of It"" wrapped its fourth season in 2012, so this Complete Seasons 1-4 package is a good way to get caught up with this ribald comedy. Created by Armando Iannucci, this sitcom (at times) plays as a fairly conventional workplace comedy driven by awkward moments and uncomfortable blunders. The cast here struggle valiantly to keep their heads above water, maintain a dignity in the most unprofessional situations, and deal with the incompetency of those around them. Here's the thing that separates ""The Thick of It,"" though. This workplace just happens to be in the top offices of the British Government. I have often heard the series described as ""The Office"" meets ""Yes, Minister"" which I think is a fair statement. When Iannucci has described the series, however, he has opted to use ""Larry Sanders"" crossed with ""Yes, Minister"" as a reference point. So, hopefully, that gives you an idea of the show's tone and humor if you have not been lucky enough to see it. Almost the entire basis for the show is how the staff can spin any occurrence, no matter how tragic or absurd, with the media, the public, and the country's real power brokers.The show revolves around the fictitious Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship, an all-encompassing oversight branch that participates and advises various other departments within the contemporary British government. Chris Langham plays the hapless minister in charge, and he's surrounded by a diverse staff all looking out for their own best interests. Their contact with the Prime Minister's office is played by Peter Capaldi, known as the Enforcer, in a tremendous performance. Capaldi (his character name is Malcolm Tucker and you won't ever forget it) is one frightening force to be reckoned with!The DVD release contains all of ""The Thick of It"" spread over 7 discs.  In addition to the episodes and specials listed below, there are a plethora of extras that include outtakes, commentary, deleted scenes, and featurettes.  If you love this show, this is the real deal package. Regular episodes are 30 minutes, the Specials are an hour, and there's a fifteen minute short. I'm listing the shows here in order.Season One: Three episodes from 2005 largely deal with Langham's new appointment and the impending feeling that each day might be his last! Serious on the job training.Season Two: Another three episodes from 2005 (these first six shows were subsequently released as a Season One DVD, but officially are two seasons), this centers around a major cabinet reshuffle which could have important implications for the survival of the department.Specials: Due to complications in Langham's personal life, plans for Season Three were thwarted and these specials aired in lieu of a new season in 2007. (1) Rise of the Nutters: As the Opposition Party rises, the crew struggle with an immigration glitch. (2) Spinners and Losers: A major shift in leadership has everyone (particularly Malcolm) scrambling. (3) Opposition extra: fifteen minute short film.Season Three: Eight episodes from 2009 introduce new faces (including Rebecca Front as the head of the department) and continue to showcase the expected blunders, but they also focus more on the opposition and the potential unraveling of Malcolm!Season Four:  Seven episodes from 2012 show a reverse of power between the government and its opposition.  With the first four parts, the show breaks format a bit and concentrates solely on one half of the political spectrum.  But the final three programs bring everyone back into the fold as everyone tries to evade blame for a public health bill that inadvertently led to public controversy and tragedy.Iannucci recently created a very similar show for HBO called ""VEEP"" which deals with the inner workings of the Vice President's office (delightfully, and sometimes painfully, played by Julia Louis Dreyfus). Also interesting to note, ""The Thick of It"" cast (led by the great Capaldi) were also the basis for the feature film ""In The Loop"" which netted Iannucci with an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay. ""The Thick of It"" is smart and incisive and utterly convincing. It may help to have a familiarity with British Government to appreciate all of its nuances, but it's not entirely necessary either. The madness and spin should be identifiable to anyone who has ever remotely followed the political scene anywhere! At the BAFTA's, Langham picked up a Best Comedy Performance award for the show's first season.

1616917,A2VLS9Y6WLKB24,B00AUMMYZW,"Mitz ""story addict""","[0, 0]","You know what, this series is so funny that there's actually very little point in anything else.It's about what goes on behind the scenes in a British political party, with stories ranging from a new minister's daughter going to a private school rather than a comprehensive (what USA calls public schools) to an aide's girlfriend stealing policy for her own (opposing) boss, to the party having to deal with bolshie members of the public.Peter Capaldi's MONSTROUS Malcolm Tucker, the scariest, cleverest, most inventively profane man in the entire world, is the Prime Minister's spin-doctor, clearing up messes and scheming and hatcheting, is a total joy.  (Fans have had great fun making up lines for him in his new role as Doctor Who, ie: 'Get in the F-ing Tardis, Ron f-ing Waesley's love-child with a f-ing Care-Bear, or I'll eat you, sick you up and grout my f-ing bathroom with you!').  Joanna Scanlan is lovely as the useless civil servant who knows no-one can touch her job, Chris Addison (Ollie Reeder) is the aide trying, on unfeasibly long legs, to catch up (my sis calls him The Claygo Worm).I throw flowers at the feet of Paul Higgins, who plays Jamie &#34;Shut It!&#34; McDonald, arguably even scarier a Scot than Malcolm Tucker, his boss - younger and more in favour of 'a pub fight' rather than 'Oxford pleasantries'.Rebecca Front is spot-on as hapless minister Nicola Murray, who gets the job that no-one wants and messes up every step along the way.  Malcolm's insults to her are priceless.  James Smith plays senior policy adviser Glenn Cullen beautifully, taking a barrage of insults from both Malcolm and Ollie.The strength of ITTOI is that there are so many brilliant characters, minor and lead, for instance: Polly Kemp as clueless, perpetually-worried Robyn, with her ghastly Sloane hairband. Stewart Pearson, the horrendous opposition spin-doctor, with his teeth-curdling management-speak and stupid ideas-generating games.  Cal Richards, Stewart's tiny, psychotic boss.  Creepy, probably psychotic Fleming, Malcolm's holiday-cover, with his improbable chin and inappropriate reactions.  Ah, and Julius.  The divinely civilized Julius, the Right Hon. Lord Nicholson of Arnage, adviser to the PM, always eating something lovely and listening to cricket, refusing to rise to Malcolm's foul language (he says 'f' instead, bless him) .  It's a travesty when Jamie is disrespectful to him!It's quite eerie to hear some of the lines given to Chris Langham, as minister Hugh Abbott, in view of his speedy disappearance after the real-life unsavoury charges against him, but the series doesn't miss a step without him.Oh, and who could forget Blinky Ben!I could go on and list the whole lot of them, because they are all wonderful creations.  Instead, I'll end with:Beautifully written and acted, this is complete TV joy.

It relates goings-on in a minor British government department (Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship, or ""DOSAC"") as they deal with (usually self-created) crises of one sort or another. While the characters would like to do good, they have no resources and so their main concern on a daily basis is usually to avoid blame for the things they do wrong, specifically to avoid having to deal with Peter Capaldi, the hilariously profane representative of the Prime Minister.What's good: The language is very funny. Since this is a DVD copy, you can put on subtitles, which trust me are very helpful when characters start insulting each other especially. It's (finally!) on region 1 DVDs; US and Canadian viewers no longer need to convert from U.K. discs.What's bad: The first episode is comparatively simplistic and obvious. Power through that, and I promise the rest are better. Lots of naughty language; if that is likely to bother you, stay away.My wife and I discovered this show after watching the movieIn The Loop.

When you watch even the first 15 minutes you will recognize the technique: The hand held camera. And, to be honest, that is not for everyone. It jumps and jitters - even more than in The Office, I think - and might give folks a headache (that is if the laughter doesn't take your mind away from it.). So,, while I can heartly recommend the set, I'll suggest that you watch a preview before going for the whole set.But aside from the above warning,  I found the show a great satire on  government politics - in a completely different way from the BBC's ""House of Cards"".
