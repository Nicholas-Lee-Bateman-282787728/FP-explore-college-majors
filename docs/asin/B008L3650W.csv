Finally, FINALLY we can see it again!Dean Martin's time as a wild west bachelor is coming to an end. He has been looking to do ""something big"" for years and his betrothed is sick of waiting. He has one week to make his mark. Meanwhile, Brain Keith almost steals the show with his hysterical low-key role as the retiring commander of a local cavalry  troop. His wife, too, is coming to take him back east. And Albert Salmi puts it all together as a desperate desperado in search of a ""woman"" in exchange for a Gatling gun. What could possibly go wrong?A unique and almost surreal Western that still stays true to that old-school Western motif. Funny a heck, it is hard to tell who is the outlaw. Some side-splitting moments that will make you fall out of your chair. A wonderful mix of A, B and C-level actors.Favorite line: ""You going to bury your friend?"" ""Um, maybe something will come down from the hills tonight and drag him off.""Looks great on my 50"" plasma; fills the screen, NOT cropped to old-fashioned TV format.

1569919,A36KR7A9Z5UTZB,B008L3650W,A. N. O'Nemus,"[1, 7]","I borrowed this from the local library - it had been on my Amazon wish list because of the cast and positive reviews, but I'm deeply grateful I didn't waste money on it.  It's a mess, and can't decide whether it's a comedy or an action film. I assume that the positive reviews are based on having enjoyed it when about ten years old, which would be understandable.Other people have written about the plot, so I won't, but there are no real laughs, although few scenes are somewhat amusing. It has some embarrassingly bad ones, though, including the usual pointless barroom brawl (it's a McLaglen film, so there'd have to be at least one).  This takes place in a saloon on an army post!  That's ludicrous even in a comedy western (as is Brian Keith's synthetic fitted uniform shirt).After all the tiresome shenanigans are done, there's a horrible shoot-'em-up scene in which dozens of faceless Mexicans are slaughtered with a Gatling gun (one which fires endlessly without reloading; in fact, more than one man was required if reloading was to be carried out).  This murderous scene is entirely out of keeping with the preceding ""humorous"" material.  Perhaps McLaglen wanted to emulate ""The Wild Bunch"" finale, or thought he was poking fun at it.  If so, he failed miserably on both counts.  If his intention was to parody the Ford cavalry westerns, as one person here suggests - I think it's very dubious - he failed horribly there, too.  ""F Troop"" did it better.Oh, and I mustn't forget the title song, which one person here calls ""terrific"" - it's awful, and plays over a boring, drawn out shot of galloping horses.  The editing of this film is even worse than the direction - and that's poor.It's sad to see Dean Martin, Brian Keith, and Ben Johnson wasted in this dross - though they must've been glad of the cash.  Martin is likeable, as usual, until he starts killing people, but the best male performances are by Albert Salmi and Robert Donner.  The female female characters - Honor Blackman and Carol White (yes, she of ""Up the Junction"" and ""Poor Cow""!) - manage to raise the tone a bit.It seems the Gatling gun was the kiss of death for several movies (at least two horrible western films bear that title), as well as for the Mexican corpses in this film. The concluding scenes of ""The Wild Bunch"" must be an exception.  For laughs, stick to ""Blazing Saddles"" or, at a pinch, the James Garner vehicle, ""Support Your Local Sheriff"".  For action - take your pick.Having said all that, I'll have to agree with others that the transfer is surprisingly good, on the whole, apart from one scene towards the end that has so many flaws in the film it looks as if there's a snowstorm.  If it weren't, the thing would be unwatchable - as the trailer on the disc bears out.",1,Dreadful - Fails on All Levels - Avoid!,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,2772,"['borrowed', 'local', 'library', 'had', 'been', 'Amazon', 'wish', 'list', 'cast', 'positive', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'deeply', 'grateful', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'mess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'comedy', 'action', 'film', 'assume', 'positive', 'reviews', 'are', 'based', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'would', 'be', 'understandable.Other', 'people', 'have', 'written', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'are', 'real', 'laughs', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'amusing', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'ones', 'though', 'including', 'usual', 'pointless', 'barroom', 'brawl', 'McLaglen', 'film', 'there', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'least', 'one', 'place', 'saloon', 'army', 'post', 'ludicrous', 'even', 'comedy', 'western', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'synthetic', 'fitted', 'uniform', 'shirt', '.After', 'tiresome', 'shenanigans', 'are', 'done', 'horrible', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'scene', 'dozens', 'faceless', 'Mexicans', 'are', 'slaughtered', 'Gatling', 'gun', 'one', 'endlessly', 'reloading', 'fact', 'more', 'one', 'man', 'was', 'required', 'reloading', 'was', 'be', 'carried', 'out', 'murderous', 'scene', 'entirely', 'keeping', 'preceding', 'humorous', 'material', 'Perhaps', 'McLaglen', 'wanted', 'emulate', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'finale', 'thought', 'was', 'poking', 'fun', 'so', 'failed', 'miserably', 'counts', 'intention', 'was', 'parody', 'Ford', 'cavalry', 'westerns', 'one', 'person', 'here', 'think', 'very', 'dubious', 'failed', 'horribly', 'there', 'too', 'F', 'Troop', 'did', 'better.Oh', 'must', ""n't"", 'forget', 'title', 'song', 'one', 'person', 'here', 'terrific', 'awful', 'over', 'boring', 'drawn', 'out', 'shot', 'galloping', 'horses', 'editing', 'film', 'even', 'worse', 'direction', 'poor.It', 'sad', 'see', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'wasted', 'dross', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'glad', 'cash', 'Martin', 'likeable', 'usual', 'killing', 'people', 'best', 'male', 'performances', 'are', 'Albert', 'Salmi', 'Robert', 'Donner', 'female', 'female', 'characters', 'Honor', 'Blackman', 'Carol', 'White', 'yes', 'Junction', 'Poor', 'Cow', 'manage', 'raise', 'tone', 'bit.It', 'Gatling', 'gun', 'was', 'kiss', 'death', 'several', 'movies', 'least', 'two', 'horrible', 'western', 'films', 'bear', 'title', 'as', 'well', 'Mexican', 'corpses', 'film', 'concluding', 'scenes', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'must', 'be', 'exception', 'laughs', 'stick', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'pinch', 'James', 'Garner', 'vehicle', 'Support', 'Your', 'Local', 'Sheriff', 'action', 'take', 'pick.Having', 'said', ""'ll"", 'have', 'agree', 'others', 'transfer', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'whole', 'apart', 'one', 'scene', 'end', 'so', 'many', 'flaws', 'film', 'snowstorm', 'were', ""n't"", 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'unwatchable', 'trailer', 'disc', 'out']",N/A

Martin holds up a stagecoach and kidnaps a woman (Honor Blackman, GOLDFINGER) for the lonely outlaw. The problem is ... she's the wife of a Colonel (Brian Keith) in command of the regional cavalry.

It manages to balance its subtle humor without making a shambles of the genre. I don't want to overpraise it, it's rather modest in its aims and execution but I can't deny I was quite taken with it. Martin, playing it fairly straight, is at his most appealing and Keith brings his own brand of solid magnetism while the leading ladies (Blackman, Carol White) are charming. There's a terrific title song by Burt Bacharach and Hal David that the film's composer Marvin Hamlisch incorporates generously into his underscore. With Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr., Denver Pyle, Paul Fix and Joyce Van Patten and Judi Meredith are hilarious as a pair of dangerous, man hungry sisters.The Paramount DVD is a handsome anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer.",4,Delightful comedy western,1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,1417,"['outlaw', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'gang', 'need', 'Gatling', 'gun', 'order', 'rob', 'treasure', 'infamous', 'Mexican', 'bandit', 'Jose', 'Angel', 'Espinosa', 'end', 'deal', 'grungy', 'lonely', 'bandit', 'Albert', 'Salmi', 'get', 'woman', 'women', 'are', 'scarce', 'territory', 'exchange', 'gun', 'Martin', 'up', 'stagecoach', 'kidnaps', 'woman', 'Honor', 'Blackman', 'GOLDFINGER', 'lonely', 'outlaw', 'problem', 'wife', 'Colonel', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'command', 'regional', 'cavalry', 'Comedy', 'westerns', 'are', 'hard', 'pull', 'off', 'are', 'satire/parody', 'kind', 'PALEFACE', 'BLAZING', 'SADDLES', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'discover', 'engaging', 'sleeper', 'balance', 'subtle', 'humor', 'making', 'shambles', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'overpraise', 'rather', 'modest', 'aims', 'execution', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'was', 'quite', 'taken', 'Martin', 'playing', 'fairly', 'straight', 'most', 'appealing', 'Keith', 'own', 'brand', 'solid', 'magnetism', 'leading', 'ladies', 'Blackman', 'Carol', 'White', 'are', 'charming', 'terrific', 'title', 'song', 'Burt', 'Bacharach', 'Hal', 'David', 'film', 'composer', 'Marvin', 'Hamlisch', 'generously', 'underscore', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', 'Judi', 'Meredith', 'are', 'hilarious', 'pair', 'dangerous', 'man', 'hungry', 'sisters.The', 'Paramount', 'DVD', 'handsome', 'anamorphic', 'wide', 'screen', '1.85', 'transfer']",N/A
