Alone, I would rate this film 5 stars.""Far From Home"" was pretty average 'boy and dog have an adventure in the wilderness' family fare.  Pleasant enough but nothing remarkable.But I was really quite appalled at the production quality of ""Rusty the Great Rescue"".  Despite featuring well-known actors in both human and voice-over form, it looked like it was made on someone's back 40 over a long weekend, and to say the dialogue was trite and stilted would be kind.  I have yet to meet a real live child who talks the way these two do.  I don't think I'll be watching this one again!",3,Two out of three ain't bad,1302480000,"04 11, 2011",2011,911,"['selected', 'item', 'was', 'looking', 'Oh', 'Heavenly', 'Dog', 'came', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'considered', 'wild', 'card', 'bonus', 'Oh', 'Heavenly', 'Dog', 'probably', 'best', 'Benji', 'movies', 'well-known', 'human', 'actors', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'compelling', 'story', 'line', 'viewer', 'interest', 'Alone', 'would', 'rate', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'Far', 'From', 'Home', 'was', 'pretty', 'average', ""'boy"", 'dog', 'have', 'adventure', 'wilderness', 'family', 'fare', 'Pleasant', 'enough', 'nothing', 'remarkable.But', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'appalled', 'production', 'quality', 'Rusty', 'Great', 'Rescue', 'featuring', 'well-known', 'actors', 'human', 'voice-over', 'form', 'looked', 'was', 'made', 'someone', 'back', '40', 'long', 'weekend', 'say', 'dialogue', 'was', 'trite', 'stilted', 'would', 'be', 'kind', 'have', 'yet', 'meet', 'real', 'live', 'child', 'who', 'way', 'two', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'one', 'again']","Triple Feat Far From Home, Oh Heavenly Dog, Rusty the Great Rescue"

I like Far From Home also, but have not tried watching Rusty as it seemed more of a juvenille type movie.Oh Heavenly Dog stars Benji which one enver hears about these days, but used to be a popular animal star. A young Chevy Chase and Jane Seymour make this movie outstanding and the ending is really good.
