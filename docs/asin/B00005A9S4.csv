As I've mentioned in the above caption, this movie was listed as One & A Half Stars by Leonard Maltin, who said (Correctly) that Theresa Russel was miscast in her role. Glenn Close (Jagged Edge) and Rebecca De Mornay (Guilty As Sin) had performances that were light years ahead of Theresa Russels! That is why the movie fell flat-- that and tepid direction from Crichton. He clearly got little from his stars. Aside from Reynolds and Beatty, few of the actors held their own in this production. Speaking of production, couldn't they (Producers) have chipped in more money so the film could have been shot completely on location in Boston instead of Toronto standing in for that tea party city?It's a shame that this movie did not come together. It had all the marks of a solid thriller, yet never reaches its mark. I recommend it only for those who (Like Me) love Burt Reynolds and always desire a thriller with stars.In short, if you can overcome Russell's bad acting and Crichton's lackluster direction (He Got Nothing From His Stars), you might be able to barely stand this below-average movie.A.

Ned Beatty turns in a decent performance as the prosecuting attorney, but nothing else about this movie makes any sense.  The plot is convoluted and silly, the writing is poor, and Theresa Russell is beautiful but unconvincing.  The role of the obviously framed cop could have been played by anyone, and Burt Reynolds phones in his performance from another planet.  There is no suspense, no urgency.  Reynolds doesn't seem to care that he is about to be convicted for a crime he didn't committed; for that matter, no one else does either.What is amazing is that this totally forgettable dreck made it to DVD, whereas Russell's much better performance in ""Impulse"" remains only on VHS.",2,very lackluster courtroom drama,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,724,"['movie', 'not', 'work', 'level', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'decent', 'performance', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'sense', 'plot', 'convoluted', 'silly', 'writing', 'poor', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'beautiful', 'unconvincing', 'role', 'obviously', 'framed', 'cop', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'anyone', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'phones', 'performance', 'planet', 'suspense', 'urgency', 'Reynolds', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'be', 'convicted', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'committed', 'matter', 'one', 'else', 'amazing', 'totally', 'forgettable', 'dreck', 'made', 'DVD', 'whereas', 'Russell', 'much', 'better', 'performance', 'Impulse', 'only', 'VHS']",Physical Evidence

Burt Reynolds plays an broke ex-cop who is accused of murder and he draws a public defender played by Jenny Hudson to defend him. Poor Burt.I recommend this film based in the genre and the MUSIC!A number of times I have watched a new film that I had never seen before and I would notice that the music was touching me deeply only to discover that it was composed by Henry Mancini. Case in point is ""Physical Evidence"". In this film you will hear one of the most beautiful and haunting themes composed. As the credits roll by for 1 minute and 35 seconds and then you see ""Music by HENRY MANCINI"".

And it was.My favorite parts were the interactions between the characters.  Theresa Russell portrayed a defense attorney named Jennifer Hudson, while Burt Reynolds was Joe Paris, the cop on trial for murder.Watching the growing attraction between these characters as they tried to solve the case (in between trial scenes) was fun, if a bit predictable.The movie was set in Boston, so I also enjoyed the street scenes, as well as the interiors of some really gorgeous homes, like the loft where Theresa Russell's character lived with her very annoying fiance, who was materialistic and a bit of an obsessive-compulsive snob.Lots of action, some violence, and a few thrill scenes, especially toward the end--all added up to a so-so movie that I'll probably watch again, but it certainly wasn't one of my favorites.

576278,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00005A9S4,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Physical Evidence is one of those films that you want to like but really should be a lot better than it actually is. Developed as a sequel to Jagged Edge for Glenn Close and Robert Loggia, it gives the impression that all involved only made it while they were waiting for something better to come along. The premise is perfectly serviceable, it's mostly technically efficient if horribly uninspired with even Henry Mancini's musacky score surprisingly pleasant, but you can't help feeling that things would have turned out better if one of the leads had turned out to be the killer (as is rumoured was originally the case). As the opening scene of his little-seen, personally disastrous Heat (1986) showed, Reynolds has all the makings of a great screen villain. As is, there are few surprises and a feeling of half-hearted filming by numbers as it builds up a head of intertia as it ambles disinterestedly towards a less than grand will-this-do? finale.Reynolds is fine, sailing through on charisma in what is clearly a star vehicle. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Theresa Russell. An impressive and fearless actress in husband Nic Roeg's films which allow her to delve into the darker side of human nature, she's trapped in a part that requires star quality rather than depth, and she ain't got it in spades. She doesn't fluff her lines or bump into the other actors, but that's about all that can be said in favour of her astonishingly stilted and often amateurish performance that lets the film down badly. Aside from Ned Beatty's prosecutor the supporting cast add only a slightly surreal presence in a Boston where everyone seems to have a badly disguised Canadian accent and the streets bear a startling resemblance to Toronto and Montreal.Likewise, director Michael Crichton, who in Westworld, Coma and The First Great Train Robbery showed that he knew how to lean an audience to the edge of their seats, seems to handle the action in a purely perfunctory fashion - indeed, in one brief chase the shots don't even match and seem thrown together almost arbitrarily. The climax itself has no flair and is completely bereft of threat or danger, and many scenes are played for far less than they are worth. It's no great surprise that, aside from uncredited reshoots on The 13th Warrior, Crichton hasn't directed since.Its watchable enough in an 80s TV movie sort of way, even if it never lives up to the promise of its opening. Whether that's enough of a reason to buy it is down to individual taste.",2,"Very jagged, not much edge",1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,2516,"['Physical', 'Evidence', 'one', 'films', 'want', 'like', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'actually', 'Developed', 'sequel', 'Jagged', 'Edge', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'impression', 'involved', 'only', 'made', 'were', 'waiting', 'something', 'better', 'come', 'along', 'premise', 'perfectly', 'serviceable', 'mostly', 'technically', 'efficient', 'horribly', 'uninspired', 'even', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'musacky', 'score', 'surprisingly', 'pleasant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'better', 'one', 'leads', 'had', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'killer', 'rumoured', 'was', 'originally', 'case', 'opening', 'scene', 'little-seen', 'personally', 'disastrous', 'Heat', '1986', 'showed', 'Reynolds', 'makings', 'great', 'screen', 'villain', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'feeling', 'half-hearted', 'filming', 'numbers', 'up', 'head', 'intertia', 'disinterestedly', 'less', 'grand', 'will-this-do', 'finale.Reynolds', 'fine', 'sailing', 'charisma', 'what', 'clearly', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Unfortunately', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'impressive', 'fearless', 'actress', 'husband', 'Nic', 'Roeg', 'films', 'allow', 'delve', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'trapped', 'part', 'star', 'quality', 'rather', 'depth', 'ai', ""n't"", 'got', 'spades', ""n't"", 'fluff', 'lines', 'bump', 'other', 'actors', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'favour', 'astonishingly', 'stilted', 'often', 'amateurish', 'performance', 'film', 'down', 'badly', 'Aside', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'prosecutor', 'supporting', 'cast', 'add', 'only', 'slightly', 'surreal', 'presence', 'Boston', 'where', 'everyone', 'have', 'badly', 'disguised', 'Canadian', 'accent', 'streets', 'bear', 'startling', 'resemblance', 'Toronto', 'Montreal.Likewise', 'director', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'who', 'Westworld', 'Coma', 'First', 'Great', 'Train', 'Robbery', 'showed', 'knew', 'how', 'lean', 'audience', 'edge', 'seats', 'handle', 'action', 'purely', 'perfunctory', 'fashion', 'indeed', 'one', 'brief', 'shots', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'match', 'seem', 'thrown', 'together', 'almost', 'arbitrarily', 'climax', 'flair', 'completely', 'bereft', 'threat', 'danger', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'played', 'far', 'less', 'are', 'worth', 'great', 'surprise', 'aside', 'uncredited', 'reshoots', '13th', 'Warrior', 'Crichton', ""n't"", 'directed', 'since.Its', 'watchable', 'enough', '80s', 'TV', 'movie', 'sort', 'way', 'even', 'never', 'up', 'promise', 'opening', 'enough', 'reason', 'buy', 'down', 'individual', 'taste']",Physical Evidence
