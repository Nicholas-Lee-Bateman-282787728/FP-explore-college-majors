Only Coach Kilmer's players (and former players) know that he's a cruel, manpulative, egomaniacal racist who will do anything to win-- even load up badly injured kids with Lidocaine so they can remain in that all-important game.When not engaging in Friday night battle, Coach's boys are typical teens, well... almost. Affable 300 lb. Billy Bob (Lester) takes his pet porker everywhere he goes. Charlie Tweeder (Caan) has an insatiable thirst for beer and uhhh... young ladies. Lance Harbor (Walker) is the golden boy star quarterback, and cheerleader Darcy Sears (Larter) is the bauble on his arm. Then there's Jonathon Moxon (Van Der Beek). This troubled back-up QB (aka: benchwarmer) is dumped on by his former starter dad (Duffy) and by Coach Wilkins, who takes every opportunity to remind 'Mox' of how worthless he truly is. Only girlfriend Jules Harbor (Smart) stands firmly by him.When Lance (who was playing injured per Wilkins' orders) rips his knee to shreds, suddenly the team and coach turn to Mox for salvation and another championship trophy. After a successful QBing debut, Darcy (who's dropped Lance like a used tissue) invites flying-high Mox over for a 'sundae.'Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(6.2) Varsity Blues (1999) - James Van Der Beek/Amy Smart/Jon Voight/Paul Walker/Ron Lester/Scott Caan/Richard Lineback/Ali Larter/Thomas F.

130642,A2582KMXLK2P06,0792162617,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Varsity Blues is about as generic a football movie you'll ever see, except for one saving point making it watchable (and the reason I reluctantly award the movie 3 stars)- the dramatic conclusion with the team overpowering the coach and taking matters into their own hands (due to the coach being a racist, demanding, short-tempered and unappreciative man who cares about winning titles more than the condition and safety of his players).If we ignore the final 20 minutes, we're left with a really ridiculous storyline that centers around several of the generic things we've come to expect out of a drama that concerns a high school football game.  Football team plays hard to please coach, quarterback parties with friends, quarterback meets plenty of attractive women, etc.  The worst part about these type of movies is how there's a feeling that whatever kind of major incident occurs, the focus should be on winning the big football game above everything else.  It strikes me as rather ridiculous.  Varsity Blues is guilty of the same issues.The only character that seems interesting is the one overweight player who experiences problems on and off the field concerning his weight.  Surprisingly, other than the coach, he's the only characters that makes any kind of impression.  You'd think the quarterback would be one of the more memorable characters but... eh, not really.There's a few other scenes that leads me to conclude the first 75% of the film isn't *completely* awful such as the girl who spreads whip cream all over her body parts as a way to make a move on the quarterback, and the younger brother walking around with a cross on his back is relatively funny.  Oh and the teacher who teaches the students about sex and the way the teenagers react.

In a montage of ordinary students who are in awe of Regina George (Rachel McAdams), one of them comments that her favorite movie is 'Varsity Blues.' I thought that Tina Fey and the 'Mean Girls' writers must have been mocking this movie, so I decided that if it was worth mocking, it would be worth watching. If it's good enough for Regina George, it's good enough for me. Let the mocking begin:Top Ten Reasons to Watch 'Varsity Blues'1. Football. & football in Texas is like a religion. Did I say like? In Texas, football IS a religion. Though an actual high school football player might scoff at 'Varsity Blues' with regards to the football scenes, I believe that the football scenes are some of the best scenes in 'Varsity Blues.' The actors trained like athletes, and were surrounded by actual football players, and when they filmed the football scenes, they were playing for keeps.2. Billy Bob. At first he seemed a cartoonish, cardboard, 2-dimensional character. He has a pet pig that he treated like a pet dog. Ron Lester was 28 but he pulled off a character only 18, albeit a big boy, but because he possessed such a baby face. Though he seemed a buffoon at first glance, his story arc was in actual fact serious drama. He sneaked in under the radar making you think he was just a clown, but then sucker punched you with a dramatic scene.3. Charlie Tweeder. I wish I could quote you some of his bon mots, but they would all be bleeped by the censor.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Charlie Tweeder: Hey you wanna see the new Tweeder end zone dance?[Tweeder dances]Charlie Tweeder: You know what it's called?Mox: What?Charlie Tweeder: The new Tweeder end zone dance.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Charlie Tweeder is one particular piece of humanity. He is an unbridled id, representing the archetypal party animal, the jock on the loose, the one who gets away with everything because he plays on the football team.4. Bud Kilmer. Jon Voight played Bud, a coach with a killer instinct, pushing them to win at any cost. He made a darn good villain.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bud Kilmer: Never show weakness, the only pain that matters is the pain you inflict.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------5. Jules Harbor. Amy Smart played Lance's sister, Jules.6. Darcy Sears. Ali Larter played Lance's girlfriend, Darcy Sears.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Darcy: Baby I got so excited thinking about next year and Florida state and the future, I think I need to be your wide receiverLance: Here babyDarcy: Well not ""here"" here, but somewhere here.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------7. Kyle. His younger brother is a total nutcase, which is a little over the top, but somehow the manic zaniness blends with the more somber tones. Kyle is always deep into the latest flavor of religion; he is wearing pure white robes or has a cult of followers worshiping him. You'd think it would disrupt the whole time-space continuum, but 'Varsity Blues' was somehow able to get away with it time after time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mo Moxon: Kyle, did you start a cult?Kyle: Yup.Mo Moxon: That is so sweet!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------8. Lance Harbor. Paul Walker played Lance, the quarterback who was the star of their town until an injury sidelined him. Not just a pretty face, he can act as well.9. Jonathon 'Mox' Moxon. What a great name for this character. He mocks. Ergo, 'Mox.' James Van Der Beek is well known to young females of a certain demographic for his role as Dawson Leery of television's 'Dawson Creek.' He brings a lot to his part; he is the strong moral center that holds the story together, the throw rug that ties the whole room together, to quote The Dude.He is a little bit smarter than most of the small town hicks, but he only mocks them in his own mind. His eyes roll ever so slightly, but we can tell what he is thinking. He is too polite and charming to say it out loud. But we hear you loud and clear.Because Lance is the star quarterback, Moxon is content to sit on the bench reading 'Slaughter House Five' by Kurt Vonnegut. He hides it in his playbook, but he isn't as smart as he thinks he is, and Coach Bud Kilmer sees right through him:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Coach Bud Kilmer: You got to be the dumbest smart kid I know.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------10. Miss Davis. Tonie Perensky as Miss Davis embodies yet another archetype that springs to life before our eyes in 'Varsity Blues.' She is the sexy librarian, or in this case the bespectacled teacher, who moonlights as a stripper. Though this is a universal fantasy of adolescent males, and I am acutely aware that I am being manipulated, I don't mind being manipulated in the least. Manipulate away.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Billy Bob: Miss Davis, would you go to the prom with me?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------When the team visits her place of employment in the evening, and she dances for them, she bears a distinct resemblance to Republican Vice Presidential Candidate and Governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. Though this movie was released in 1999, it couldn't be timelier. Larry Flynt scrambles to get his Nailin' Palin in the store by Xmas, but fast forward 'Varsity Blues' and there she is.

It made me cry a bit because I at that time I was out of work and wondering how I was going to make ends meet.  Let's not get personal here.The movie begins with four boys playing football.  They are having fun.  Then it goes back to the present.  The same boys are now teenagers and playing high school football.  It's not all fun and games.  It's about winning the championship and glorifying the coach.  I can't believe that they even have a statue of him!  He is no Abraham Lincoln.  Give me a break.As I was saying, the main character Jonathan ""Mox"" Moxon, played by James Van Der Beek (with dyed brown hair) plays high school football and reads literature on the side.  He is more concerned about his academic abilities than he is about the game.  When the QB Lance Harbour, played by Paul Walker (Fast and Furious series)is injured, Moxon has to take his place.  The spotlight at first, is engrossing.  But he realizes that it will jeopardize the person that he--trustworthy and understanding.  The last thing he wants is to steal his best friend's girl.The movie doesn't only focus on Moxon, but his friends--Lance, Billy Bob, Charlie Tweeder, and Wendell Brown are also affected by the pressures of football and their relationship with the coach.""Varsity Blues"" focuses on the pride of school sports in small-towns that sometimes gets out of control.  Parents have high expectations of what their son or daughter should be--an athlete or a cheerleader.  And Mox's father wanted his son to live up to his expectations because he was never able to live up to his dream.This movie is a cathartic.  Whenever you feel like life is throwing you a curveball, watch this movie.  Jonathan Moxon never allowed anyone or anything to get in his way.  He knew what he wanted and was determined to go after it and also help his fellow teammates.",5,School Sports Needs to Be Reexamined,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,1927,"['watched', 'movie', 'theatre', '1999', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'made', 'cry', 'bit', 'time', 'was', 'work', 'wondering', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Let', 'not', 'get', 'personal', 'here.The', 'movie', 'four', 'boys', 'playing', 'football', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'Then', 'back', 'present', 'same', 'boys', 'are', 'now', 'teenagers', 'playing', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'not', 'fun', 'games', 'winning', 'championship', 'glorifying', 'coach', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'even', 'have', 'statue', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Give', 'break.As', 'was', 'saying', 'main', 'character', 'Jonathan', 'Mox', 'Moxon', 'played', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'dyed', 'hair', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'literature', 'side', 'more', 'concerned', 'academic', 'abilities', 'game', 'When', 'QB', 'Lance', 'Harbour', 'played', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'series', 'injured', 'Moxon', 'take', 'place', 'spotlight', 'first', 'engrossing', 'will', 'jeopardize', 'person', 'trustworthy', 'understanding', 'last', 'thing', 'steal', 'best', 'friend', 'girl.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'only', 'focus', 'Moxon', 'friends', 'Lance', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Tweeder', 'Wendell', 'Brown', 'are', 'also', 'affected', 'pressures', 'football', 'relationship', 'coach', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'pride', 'school', 'sports', 'small-towns', 'sometimes', 'control', 'Parents', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'what', 'son', 'daughter', 'should', 'be', 'athlete', 'cheerleader', 'Mox', 'father', 'wanted', 'son', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'live', 'up', 'dream.This', 'movie', 'cathartic', 'Whenever', 'feel', 'life', 'throwing', 'curveball', 'watch', 'movie', 'Jonathan', 'Moxon', 'never', 'allowed', 'anyone', 'anything', 'get', 'way', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'was', 'determined', 'go', 'also', 'help', 'fellow', 'teammates']",N/A
130653,A11PTCZ2FM2547,0792162617,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[11, 12]","When I first saw this film, I hated it.  I could not find a single likeable character in the movie:  the backup quarterback who couldn't seem to make up his mind whether to be ambivalent or committed to football; an obsessed, fanatical head coach; shallow, self-absorbed, hedonistic jocks; a whipped cream cheerleader; a little brother with an identity crisis; and moronic football dads wanting to do nothing more than live vicariously through their sons.  Outside of a headbanging soundtrack and sensational football action, I was anything but impressed with VARSITY BLUES.Then I caught the film on cable recently, and watched it.  Then I rented it, and watched it again.  Perhaps I had been too judgmental my first viewing:  VARSITY BLUES was slowly but surely revealing itself to me as a very entertaining movie.  I came to appreciate Jonathan ""Mox"" Moxon (James Van Der Beek), a second string quarterback with aspirations to go to an Ivy League college suddenly thrust into the spotlight of his west Texas town as the new starting signal caller.  I came to loathe  Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight), the epitome of the abusive, cruel, vindictive, win-at-all-costs head football coach.  I came to enjoy the small town ""feel"" of this film, where high school football players are placed on a pedestal and allowed to run wild.  And what can you say about Billy Bob (Ron Lester) and Tweeder (Scott Caan), other than these two raunchy characters flavor this movie whenever they appear like onions in Texas chili?Setting aside a hopelessly unrealistic player revolt (Where were the other coaches to take over when Kilmer left?), director Brian Robbins furnishes fast-moving, high-octane football scenes guaranteed to make those of us who have played the game (and still love it) want to strap on the pads again.  VARSITY BLUES is less than perfect, like a six-pack of warm beer, but still satisfying to the last drop.",4,Kind of Grows on You,1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,1904,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'hated', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'single', 'likeable', 'character', 'movie', 'backup', 'quarterback', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'be', 'ambivalent', 'committed', 'football', 'obsessed', 'fanatical', 'head', 'coach', 'shallow', 'self-absorbed', 'hedonistic', 'jocks', 'whipped', 'cream', 'cheerleader', 'little', 'brother', 'identity', 'crisis', 'moronic', 'football', 'dads', 'wanting', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'live', 'vicariously', 'sons', 'headbanging', 'soundtrack', 'sensational', 'football', 'action', 'was', 'anything', 'impressed', 'VARSITY', 'BLUES.Then', 'caught', 'film', 'cable', 'recently', 'watched', 'Then', 'rented', 'watched', 'again', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'been', 'too', 'judgmental', 'first', 'viewing', 'VARSITY', 'BLUES', 'was', 'slowly', 'surely', 'revealing', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'came', 'appreciate', 'Jonathan', 'Mox', 'Moxon', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'second', 'string', 'quarterback', 'aspirations', 'go', 'Ivy', 'League', 'college', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'spotlight', 'west', 'Texas', 'town', 'new', 'starting', 'signal', 'caller', 'came', 'loathe', 'Bud', 'Kilmer', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'epitome', 'abusive', 'cruel', 'vindictive', 'win-at-all-costs', 'head', 'football', 'coach', 'came', 'enjoy', 'small', 'town', 'feel', 'film', 'where', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'players', 'are', 'placed', 'pedestal', 'allowed', 'run', 'wild', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Ron', 'Lester', 'Tweeder', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'other', 'two', 'raunchy', 'characters', 'flavor', 'movie', 'whenever', 'appear', 'onions', 'Texas', 'chili', 'Setting', 'aside', 'hopelessly', 'unrealistic', 'player', 'revolt', 'Where', 'were', 'other', 'coaches', 'take', 'over', 'when', 'Kilmer', 'left', 'director', 'Brian', 'Robbins', 'fast-moving', 'high-octane', 'football', 'scenes', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'who', 'have', 'played', 'game', 'still', 'love', 'want', 'strap', 'pads', 'again', 'VARSITY', 'BLUES', 'less', 'perfect', 'six-pack', 'warm', 'beer', 'still', 'satisfying', 'last', 'drop']",N/A

130656,A2IY9M330NKBW6,0792162617,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","I just saw this movie for the first time. It was one of those that passed me up on its original release, but for some reason I kept seeing it referred to so I figured maybe I ought to check it out. I was glad I did. This is a good watch with a good heart. Were it not for the fact that it has both feet firmly planted in Hollywood it would be even better.One cannot help but compare it to the later (and much better) Friday Night Lights. Both deal with the issues of being in a top ranked high school football team in Texas. And both focus on the pressures of competing along with the pressures of growing up. Varsity Blues takes a more main line approach. It's much less subtle and felt the need to put up a big Hollywood type ending.I won't recount the plot as others have done so, but the film does show equal parts of sympathy and Animal House for the main characters. Yes they're young kids feeling their stuff. They are on a winning team in a small town so they're local heroes. They get a lot of attention. Get all kinds of stuff (including liquor) for free and people (even police) turn their heads when they do things that are untoward. Some of them are hot dogs and soak it for all it's worth (the Scott Caan character) and some are smarter and more introspective (the James VanderBeek character). But they all are under the thumb of their coach (Jon Voight) who is really more of a military type. He is going to win the war and he knows it will cost lives and he's willing to sacrifice his men (boys) to do so.The production values are good enough to get the point across and hide the bones. The acting is OK with Voight being the best of the lot. The minor sub plot involving the sex ed teacher who is a stripper by night is totally gratuitous and, given VanderBeek's character, nonsensical, but this is a comfortable watch. It won't change your life but a bowl of popcorn and a reasonably cold beer will make this an enjoyable experience.",3,Heart's in the Right Place,1277769600,"06 29, 2010",2010,1951,"['just', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'passed', 'up', 'original', 'release', 'reason', 'kept', 'seeing', 'referred', 'so', 'figured', 'maybe', 'ought', 'check', 'out', 'was', 'glad', 'did', 'good', 'watch', 'good', 'heart', 'Were', 'not', 'fact', 'feet', 'firmly', 'planted', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'better.One', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'compare', 'later', 'much', 'better', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'deal', 'issues', 'being', 'top', 'ranked', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'Texas', 'focus', 'pressures', 'competing', 'pressures', 'growing', 'up', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'more', 'main', 'line', 'approach', 'much', 'less', 'subtle', 'felt', 'need', 'put', 'up', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'ending.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recount', 'plot', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'film', 'show', 'equal', 'parts', 'sympathy', 'Animal', 'House', 'main', 'characters', 'Yes', ""'re"", 'young', 'kids', 'feeling', 'stuff', 'are', 'winning', 'team', 'small', 'town', ""'re"", 'local', 'heroes', 'get', 'lot', 'attention', 'Get', 'kinds', 'stuff', 'including', 'liquor', 'free', 'people', 'even', 'police', 'turn', 'heads', 'when', 'do', 'things', 'are', 'untoward', 'are', 'hot', 'dogs', 'soak', 'worth', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'character', 'are', 'smarter', 'more', 'introspective', 'James', 'VanderBeek', 'character', 'are', 'thumb', 'coach', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'who', 'really', 'more', 'military', 'type', 'going', 'win', 'war', 'will', 'cost', 'lives', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'men', 'boys', 'do', 'so.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'get', 'point', 'hide', 'bones', 'acting', 'OK', 'Voight', 'being', 'best', 'lot', 'minor', 'sub', 'plot', 'involving', 'sex', 'teacher', 'who', 'stripper', 'night', 'totally', 'gratuitous', 'given', 'VanderBeek', 'character', 'nonsensical', 'comfortable', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'life', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'reasonably', 'cold', 'beer', 'will', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'experience']",N/A
130657,A3LH77PBDFEO3F,0792162617,"G. E. Williams ""Nunah""","[1, 1]","I have avoided Varsity Blues all the years since it came out. I had no desire to see a film directed at High Schooler's, made by MTV. Finally, this week I watched it and was very surprised at how much I liked it.First of all, of course anyone who played high school or college sports will be able to relate to the love hate relationship with sports. And most will relate at some level with the evil coach played to a caricature ""T"" by Jon Voight. Now I never had a coach as evil as Kilmer, but there were a few that really disrespected me, and a few to whom winning was a bit too important, and also a few who's favoritism really hurt the program, so I can relate.Varsity Blues was a stereotypical teen flick in some ways, it could have minimized the sex and drugs and alcohol, but overall, Varsity Blues gets to the message of the game should be played with joy and by doing so the memories of your glory days will be pleasant instead of the time you can't move beyond. Although it ended a bit on a confusing note, with a voice over by the protagonist ""Mox"" about how ""that was the last game that I ever played"", when in fact they won and should have gone on to some play-off since they were undefeated. But that's a quibble, maybe without a head coach they were disqualified?So here's the deal,Varsity Blues is not a bad movie at all if you can look over the sex& drugs.

130659,A3CGHACA377KS,0792162617,G. Williams,"[0, 0]",The movie was great. I would guess all the 1 star ratings were completely biases against a little too much teen age party sex. Yes there was a touch too much but the movie was well made and well acted and was pretty real to our football culture. Football is very important to us all and it builds character whether we like it or not. Jon Voight was great in this movie and so were all those acting as high school kids and their parents. Nothing is perfect and most successful people feel the let down of the injured quarterback. His only visit in the hospital was his replacement quarterback. life is great if we make it great and just get through the pettiness of High School partying and get to what is important and that is teamwork and that is what this movie showed.

130661,A2HVL790PBWYTU,0792162617,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Sure, VARSITY BLUES delivers an incisive look at the insane pressures and the sheer callousness which surround sports. Even more specifically it offers a peek at how the game of football gains godlike status in small rural towns, what with nothing else to distract the natives but tipping cows, hanging at honky tonks, and harvesting whatever. In West Canaan, Texas, football rules all, fathers live vicariously thru their sons, and the local high school football team is administered with a monstrous iron-fisted grip by Coach Bud Kilmer (played by Jon Voight with maniacal glee). Coach Kilmer thinks nothing of bending rules, thinks nothing of placing his own athletes in jeopardy. Because winning trumps all, and glory is everything. That statue of him looming over the football field is everything.But what happens when the celebrated hometown hero quarterback goes down for the season? And what's left is an iconoclastic second-string quarterback who isn't willing to sip the coach's Kool-Aid? Can even a kid as grounded as Mox withstand the overwhelming barrage of fame and worship (and free beer) now directed his way? When Mox starts conducting interviews in which he thanks God and refers to himself in the third person, his level-headed girlfriend sure isn't impressed.So when you're watching VARSITY BLUES there's a whole mess of sports tropes you can check off the list. In a sports movie, it's really hard to steer clear of them tropes. What makes VARSITY BLUES one of the better films in its genre is the heart that went into it. Director Brian Robbins was directed to craft a raunchy PORKY'S-type comedy, and while the raunchiness remains, Robbins' willingness to buck the suits won out. Robbins preferred to make a HOOSIERS-type film, and I do think this picture, by a nose hair, dispenses more gravitas than locker room levity. It has stuff to say, and while we may have heard the message before, this movie delivers it with damning insight. Maybe it all boils down to Mox harshly telling his dad: ""Playing football at West Canaan may have been the opportunity of your lifetime, but I don't want your life.""Not to play devil's advocate (except, now, I guess I'm gonna), I will say that, despite being such a lowdown martinet, Coach Kilmer was justified in several of his dressing downs of Mox. Mox had no business reading a book during practice or taking his teammates drinking on the eve of a game. Still, Jon Voight excels at getting hissed at and his character, at heart, really is a despicable, sadistic tool. Voight's presence never fails to lend legitimacy onscreen.VARSITY BLUES came out in 1999, and features a terrific ensemble cast, anchored by a very good James Van Der Beek as ""Mox."" Paul Walker, Amy Smart, and Ali Larter were your basic up-and-comers back then, but they all oozed potential. Ron Lester as Billy Bob is wonderful, and the ad-libbing Scott Caan is utterly hilarious as Tweeder, the hard-drinking loose cannon wide receiver who ends up stealing all the scenes and, at one point, the police squad car.Sports writer Bill Simmons claimed that ALL THE RIGHT MOVES demonstrated better bone-crunching football action, but VARSITY BLUES itself isn't sparing with the hard-hitting football sequences, and some folks seriously get stretched on screen. I label VARSITY BLUES as a sports drama, but plenty of times you'll laugh your what off. So many standout moments in this movie: The William Tell challenge at the barbecue; the ""Too Hot for Teacher"" sequence; Mox's oddball younger brother and his goofy quest for religion; the fact that no mascot is safe from getting a faceful of football; and ""You want some cheese with that whine?""; and, omigosh, the whip cream bikini. I'm calling this movie a classic.The DVD's special features: a pretty listenable commentary ten years after the movie's release with Director Brian Robbins and Producers Tova Laiter and Mike Tollin; ""Football is a Way of Life"": the Making of VARSITY BLUES (00:17:46 minutes); ""Two-A-Days the Ellis Way"" - the cast undergoes training camp under football coordinator Mark Ellis (00:07:48); QB Game Analysis - Mark Ellis and NFL and ex-Texas quarterback Josh McCown critique the film's football aspects and reflect on how the film so closely emulates the small town lifestyle and its obsession with football (00:15:15); Billy Bob with No Bacon - a segment intercutting between the present-day and much, much thinner Ron Lester and the humongous Ron Lester of a decade ago (00:04:39); and the theatrical trailer for VARSITY BLUES.",5,"""Hey, if you're hungry, I left a few hot dogs in here.""",1280016000,"07 25, 2010",2010,4537,"['Sure', 'VARSITY', 'BLUES', 'incisive', 'look', 'insane',

130662,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0792162617,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 2]","You have the right to say: one more high school varsity football film. And it has absolutely all the defects of these films: the kids are unthinkable non-thinking machines. At first at least. The coach is a brute that dopes his players or gives them unethical injections for them to play even when they should not. He is a gross character who treats his players as if they were in a marine training camp and he were a training sergeant as depicted by some films about the Vietnam war. Gross language, blackmailing, violence even are some of his skins on top of the illegal stuff and unethical actions.But the film reveals two elements that are essential to understand this sport is not exactly and only that. First the fathers are shown as being pure idiots who want their children to play football for only two reasons: because they played football when they were going to that particular high school themselves. They are frankly undrinkable nostalgic-spirited bigots about football. And the second reason is that their sons can earn, or win, a full scholarship in college, alleviating the expense for the family. That transforms football into some kind of narrow-minded culture, not to speak of open institutionalized moral prostitution or slavery.The teenagers are well obliged, willy-nilly for some, to play the game which means violence, superficial clich&eacute;s and attitudes including racism against the only black on the team, sexism and hefty male-chauvinistic attitudes, some girls overplaying the game by becoming the prize of each game for the winner. Not to speak of alcohol and other inacceptable practices including public or semi-public sex, driving under the influence, drinking binges and challenges, and even some open and gross misdemeanor. This film becomes then some kind of a manifesto against that absurd and inhumane culture.But the film also shows how the initial quarterback is the victim of some medical mishandling from the coach, and how he will in the last game of the season support his ""substitute"" that leads that game to a direct confrontation of the whole team with the coach. This coach is on the point of forcing the only black player to accept an injection in his knee to go back on the field. The substitute quarterback tells the black player not to do it and he quits when he is menaced by the coach. But he had built a new spirit in the team putting the black chap in the front and using several other tactics that were creative and valorizing for other players than himself, or the coach. The team then refuses to go back for the second half of the game and the coach is forced to leave. The players then take over: the ex- and the new quarterbacks together, the ex- assuming the coach's position. And the rest is the good ending.Football, like all other sports, could be a beautiful adventure for the players all the time if some coaches did not use the system to valorize themselves by over exploiting the players. But apart from what I have said, yes it is another high school varsity football film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",4,Can football be a humane game too?,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,3181,"['have', 'right', 'say', 'one', 'more', 'high', 'school', 'varsity', 'football', 'film', 'absolutely', 'defects', 'films', 'kids', 'are', 'unthinkable', 'non-thinking', 'machines', 'first', 'least', 'coach', 'brute', 'players', 'unethical', 'injections', 'play', 'even', 'when', 'should', 'not', 'gross', 'character', 'who', 'players', 'were', 'marine', 'training', 'camp', 'were', 'training', 'sergeant', 'depicted', 'films', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'Gross', 'language', 'blackmailing', 'violence', 'even', 'are', 'skins', 'top', 'illegal', 'stuff', 'unethical', 'actions.But', 'film', 'reveals', 'two', 'elements', 'are', 'essential', 'understand', 'sport', 'not', 'exactly', 'only', 'First', 'fathers', 'are', 'shown', 'being', 'pure', 'idiots', 'who', 'want', 'children', 'play', 'football', 'only', 'two', 'reasons', 'played', 'football', 'when', 'were', 'going', 'particular', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'frankly', 'undrinkable', 'nostalgic-spirited', 'bigots', 'football', 'second', 'reason', 'sons', 'can', 'earn', 'win', 'full', 'scholarship', 'college', 'alleviating', 'expense', 'family', 'football', 'kind', 'narrow-minded', 'culture', 'not', 'speak', 'open', 'institutionalized', 'moral', 'prostitution', 'slavery.The', 'teenagers', 'are', 'well', 'obliged', 'willy-nilly', 'play', 'game', 'violence', 'superficial', 'clich', 'eacute', 'attitudes', 'including', 'racism', 'only', 'black', 'team', 'sexism', 'hefty', 'male-chauvinistic', 'attitudes', 'girls', 'overplaying', 'game', 'becoming', 'prize', 'game', 'winner', 'Not', 'speak', 'alcohol', 'other', 'inacceptable', 'practices', 'including', 'public', 'semi-public', 'sex', 'driving', 'influence', 'drinking', 'binges', 'challenges', 'even', 'open', 'gross', 'misdemeanor', 'film', 'then', 'kind', 'manifesto', 'absurd', 'inhumane', 'culture.But', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'initial', 'quarterback', 'victim', 'medical', 'mishandling', 'coach', 'how', 'will', 'last', 'game', 'season', 'support', 'substitute', 'game', 'direct', 'confrontation', 'whole', 'team', 'coach', 'coach', 'point', 'forcing', 'only', 'black', 'player', 'accept', 'injection', 'knee', 'go', 'back', 'field', 'substitute', 'quarterback', 'black', 'player', 'not', 'do', 'when', 'menaced', 'coach', 'had', 'built', 'new', 'spirit', 'team', 'putting', 'black', 'chap', 'front', 'using', 'several', 'other', 'tactics', 'were', 'creative', 'valorizing', 'other', 'players', 'coach', 'team', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'second', 'half', 'game', 'coach', 'forced', 'leave', 'players', 'then', 'take', 'over', 'ex-', 'new', 'quarterbacks', 'together', 'ex-', 'assuming', 'coach', 'position', 'rest', 'good', 'ending.Football', 'other', 'sports', 'could', 'be', 'beautiful', 'adventure', 'players', 'time', 'coaches', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'system', 'valorize', 'exploiting', 'players', 'apart', 'what', 'have', 'said', 'yes', 'high', 'school', 'varsity', 'football', 'film.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

130664,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,0792162617,Jason,"[1, 1]","The brief synopsis: In West Canaan, Texas, football is life.  The entire city revolves around the religion of football.  The team is led by big-man-on-campus Lance Harbor (Paul Walker).  Along with the typical cast of zany teammates, a maniacal, championship coach named Bud Kilmer (Jon Voigt - awesome in this role), and the backup QB, Jonathan Moxon (Van Der Beek), the team faces and overcomes difficulties.  Team pulls out improbable, far-fetched play to triumph in the end.  Tons of exciting and believable football action sequences.  There has always been something about the movie that troubled me, however - aside from the improbability of finding a football helmet that would fit Dawson's coconut - Jonathan Moxon's character.Mox never studies, yet he's rumored to be in the running for an academic scholarship to an Ivy League University (Brown).  When Harbor goes down early in the season, Mox must step up and be a hero.  With scholarship dreams dancing in his head, Mox had put all of his eggs in one basket.  The only problem is his complete nonchalance and inattentiveness to his studies also leaks into his football.  Despite these deficiencies, he becomes an overnight superstar.  He gets free beer after the game, but it's not a big deal.  Everything up until this point in the movie is fishy, and THIS is where I figured out what was going on.No real controversy to get beer.  Hmm.  Doesn't study school books or play books.  Hmm.  Mox has failed over ten times; he's in his late twenties, been in high school for years, and his receding hairline finally gave him away.The reason he didn't need to read the playbook is because he memorized the plays.  Kilmer has been using the same plays for each of Dawson's last 8 years as a backup!  It appears that Kilmer is frustrated that Mox doesn't read the playbook or pay attention during games, but it's actually because he's sick of seeing Mox on the sidelines.  If he is going to stick around that long, he may as well be an assistant coach.Why doesn't he study in the classroom?  He's auditing the courses!  He's essentially the white Radio, going to class even when it doesn't matter.  He's been applying to Brown for years!  That's why it's so important to him.  He wants to FINALLY move out of his parents' house.In the middle of the movie, he turns down Ali Larter (who should be a megastar because of this scene alone) in a whipped cream bikini.  No way a teenage boy turns that down.  No way.  Why does Moxon?  Two words: statutory rape.  Why is he with Amy Smart?  Because he knows she's the goody-two-shoes, and there is no risk (i.e. no breasts).  How do the guys get into the strip club, let alone get a free ride?  It's on Moxon's credit card; he opened a tab!It all adds up folks.  It doesn't get in the way of making this one of the more imminently rewatchable sports movies of all time, but it definitely adds something to the viewing pleasure.  Even on late-night TV, this is always a must watch - a TEN! - if only to prove my theory once again.",5,"Absolutely great sports movie, but what's up with Moxon?",1242259200,"05 14, 2009",2009,3027,"['brief', 'synopsis', 'West', 'Canaan', 'Texas', 'football', 'life', 'entire', 'city', 'religion', 'football', 'team', 'led', 'big-man-on-campus', 'Lance', 'Harbor', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'typical', 'cast', 'zany', 'teammates', 'maniacal', 'championship', 'coach', 'named', 'Bud', 'Kilmer', 'Jon', 'Voigt', 'awesome', 'role', 'backup', 'QB', 'Jonathan', 'Moxon', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'team', 'difficulties', 'Team', 'out', 'improbable', 'far-fetched', 'play', 'triumph', 'end', 'Tons', 'exciting', 'believable', 'football', 'action', 'sequences', 'always', 'been', 'something', 'movie', 'troubled', 'however', 'aside', 'improbability', 'finding', 'football', 'helmet', 'would', 'fit', 'Dawson', 'coconut', 'Jonathan', 'Moxon', 'character.Mox', 'never', 'studies', 'rumored', 'be', 'running', 'academic', 'scholarship', 'Ivy', 'League', 'University', 'Brown', 'When', 'Harbor', 'down', 'early', 'season', 'Mox', 'must', 'step', 'up', 'be', 'hero', 'scholarship', 'dreams', 'dancing', 'head', 'Mox', 'had', 'put', 'eggs', 'one', 'basket', 'only', 'problem', 'complete', 'nonchalance', 'inattentiveness', 'studies', 'also', 'leaks', 'football', 'deficiencies', 'overnight', 'superstar', 'free', 'beer', 'game', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'Everything', 'up', 'point', 'movie', 'fishy', 'THIS', 'where', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'on.No', 'real', 'controversy', 'get', 'beer', 'Hmm', ""n't"", 'study', 'school', 'books', 'play', 'books', 'Hmm', 'Mox', 'failed', 'over', 'ten', 'times', 'late', 'twenties', 'been', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'receding', 'hairline', 'finally', 'gave', 'away.The', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'read', 'playbook', 'memorized', 'plays', 'Kilmer', 'been', 'using', 'same', 'plays', 'Dawson', 'last', '8', 'years', 'backup', 'Kilmer', 'frustrated', 'Mox', ""n't"", 'read', 'playbook', 'pay', 'attention', 'games', 'actually', 'sick', 'seeing', 'Mox', 'sidelines', 'going', 'stick', 'around', 'long', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'assistant', 'coach.Why', ""n't"", 'study', 'classroom', 'auditing', 'courses', 'essentially', 'white', 'Radio', 'going', 'class', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'matter', 'been', 'applying', 'Brown', 'years', 'why', 'so', 'important', 'FINALLY', 'move', 'parents', 'house.In', 'middle', 'movie', 'down', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'megastar', 'scene', 'alone', 'whipped', 'cream', 'bikini', 'way', 'teenage', 'boy', 'down', 'way', 'Why', 'Moxon', 'Two', 'words', 'statutory', 'rape', 'Why', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'goody-two-shoes', 'risk', 'i.e', 'breasts', 'How', 'do', 'guys', 'get', 'strip', 'club', 'let', 'alone', 'get', 'free', 'ride', 'Moxon', 'credit', 'card', 'opened', 'tab', 'up', 'folks', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'making', 'one', 'more', 'imminently', 'rewatchable', 'sports', 'movies', 'time', 'definitely', 'something', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'Even', 'late-night', 'TV', 'always', 'must', 'watch', 'TEN', 'only', 'prove', 'theory', 'once', 'again']",N/A

Coach Hades later calls Star QB a ""gimp.""- New QB (Van Der Beek) quickly becomes the star, even though he hates Hades Coach and organized football in general.  Undercuts Hades Coach's authority at every opportunity, but somehow doesn't get booted off the team for acting like a complete douche.  Takes all the skill players out to a strip club for an all-night drinking binge right before a game (more underage binge drinking).  Later organizes mutiny against Hades Coach.  Has a full academic scholarship to Brown, though I can't figure out why since he shows little interest in school thru the movie.- Team is apparently made up entirely of alcoholics, as they get fetal-position drunk at parties after every game.  The police visit frequently but don't seem to mind the underage drinking and occasional drug use going on.  Other team members are useful in supplying pain killers to the squad as needed.- Interesting that this amazing team who has won multiple titles over the years has *one* head coach, and no assistants.  So after the team mutiny in the big game the old star QB takes over as coach and of course leads the team to the big victory.  I was also surprised that a great athlete like New QB just rode the pine prior to Star QB's injury; typically good high school teams will get their best athletes on the field somewhere, or even play them on both offense and defense to maximize their contribution.- Other fun tidbits includes the cheerleader who's job it is to bang whoever the QB is; a Sex Ed teacher at the school who (surprise! well maybe not) moonlights as a stripper at a local club and has managed to keep it a secret from everyone in town; one of the players who steals a cop car but of course suffers no consequences.  And the only parents to show up in the movie are so football-obsessed they don't give a damn what there kids are doing any time other than Friday night at the local stadium.If this was an over-the-top comedy I'd be OK with it, but they actually try to play this straight.

130666,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,0792162617,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[3, 17]","I don't know what the residents of Texas did to the folks responsible for Varsity Blues but, on behalf of my home state, let me say that I sincerely apologize for whatever it was that led you to make this truly awful, truly stupid, truly useless film.  Now, get over it!Anyway, with that off my chest, Varsity Blues is basically the story of an intellectual high school football jock played by James Van Der Beek.  We know he's an intellectual because we see him reading Slaughterhouse Five on the sidelines.  Oh, and he doesn't like his small town's revered high school football coach.  We know he's evil because he's played by Jon Voight.  After the school's star quarterback is injured, Van Der Beek takes his place and soon becomes the town's biggest hero.  But, as stated previously, Van Der Beek reads Slaughterhouse Five so, of course, he's above such petty things.  He's going to play football but he's going to do it HIS way (no, make no doubt about it, in this film James Van Der Beek is anything but unstuck in time).This is a film that wants to have it both ways -- high school football is condemned as being essentially a fascist pursuit that destroys the young but at the same time, isn't it great to see Van Der Beek lead the team to victory?  There's more to life than just attending keggers and having meaningless sex with cheerleaders but, just for the sake of argument, let's fill the entire film with keggers and meaningless sex with cheerleaders.  The film, in short, is an MTV production and the director makes sure we never forget this by keeping his camera constantly and continually spinning around as if desperately trying to fool us into thinking there's actually something interesting happening on screen.  As bad as the direction is, the script actually manages to be even worse by giving us a collection of stereotypical, one demensional characters and scenes that have appeared in just about every other sports film ever made.  With a script this bad, its unfair to penalize the actors for giving awful performances but who ever said life was fair?  Voight glowers as if he can't believe he's doing this while his daughter wins an Oscar.  Scott Caan, as Van Der Beek's wild friend and teammate, lets his smirk carry him through the film.  As the token fat guy, Ron Lester is so believably pathetic that you'll want to smack some sense into him.  Van Der Beek, meanwhile, plays his role with a fatal combination of intensity and smugness and, sadly, seems to be convinced that he's making a truly important film.  Since this film is set in Texas, we get a lot of cowboy hats and a lot of overdone drawls that, whatever they are, certainly aren't Texan.  Van Der Beek's accent is, without a doubt, one of the worst attempts at a southwestern drawl I have ever heard.  Yes, Texans do speak with a drawl and we do have a very noticeable accent (myself certainly included).  But, like everyone else on the planet, we also have our own individual speech rhythms with the occasional variations in tone and pitch.  Unlike Van Der Beek's intellectual jock, we do not deliver every sentence in the exact same drawling monotone!  Still, trying to figure out just where exactly Van Der Beek's accent came from is probably the most entertaining part of the film which is so simpleminded and by-the-numbers, it doesn't even succeed at achieving a level of camp.  Some bad movies you can at least laugh at.  Varsity Blues, on the other hand, is one of the dullest films I've ever seen.  Its a great cure for insomnia if nothing else.",1,"Wow, what an awful film",1002585600,"10 9, 2001",2001,3549,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'residents', 'Texas', 'did', 'folks', 'responsible', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'behalf', 'home', 'state', 'let', 'say', 'sincerely', 'apologize', 'whatever', 'was', 'led', 'make', 'truly', 'awful', 'truly', 'stupid', 'truly', 'useless', 'film', 'Now', 'get', 'Anyway', 'off', 'chest', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'basically', 'story', 'intellectual', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'jock', 'played', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'know', 'intellectual', 'see', 'reading', 'Slaughterhouse', 'Five', 'sidelines', 'Oh', ""n't"", 'like', 'small', 'town', 'revered', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'coach', 'know', 'evil', 'played', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'school', 'star', 'quarterback', 'injured', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'place', 'soon', 'town', 'biggest', 'hero', 'stated', 'previously', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'Slaughterhouse', 'Five', 'so', 'course', 'such', 'petty', 'things', 'going', 'play', 'football', 'going', 'do', 'HIS', 'way', 'make', 'doubt', 'film', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'anything', 'unstuck', 'time', '.This', 'film', 'have', 'ways', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'condemned', 'being', 'essentially', 'fascist', 'pursuit', 'young', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'great', 'see', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'lead', 'team', 'victory', 'more', 'life', 'just', 'attending', 'keggers', 'having', 'meaningless', 'sex', 'cheerleaders', 'just', 'sake', 'argument', 'let', 'fill', 'entire', 'film', 'keggers', 'meaningless', 'sex', 'cheerleaders', 'film', 'short', 'MTV', 'production', 'director', 'sure', 'never', 'forget', 'keeping', 'camera', 'constantly', 'continually', 'spinning', 'around', 'desperately', 'trying', 'fool', 'thinking', 'actually', 'something', 'interesting', 'happening', 'screen', 'As', 'bad', 'direction', 'script', 'actually', 'be', 'even', 'worse', 'giving', 'collection', 'stereotypical', 'one', 'demensional', 'characters', 'scenes', 'have', 'appeared', 'just', 'other', 'sports', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'script', 'bad', 'unfair', 'penalize', 'actors', 'giving', 'awful', 'performances', 'who', 'ever', 'said', 'life', 'was', 'fair', 'Voight', 'glowers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'doing', 'daughter', 'Oscar', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'wild', 'friend', 'teammate', 'smirk', 'carry', 'film', 'token', 'fat', 'guy', 'Ron', 'Lester', 'so', 'believably', 'pathetic', ""'ll"", 'want', 'smack', 'sense', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'meanwhile', 'role', 'fatal', 'combination', 'intensity', 'smugness', 'sadly', 'be', 'convinced', 'making', 'truly', 'important', 'film', 'film', 'set', 'Texas', 'get', 'lot', 'cowboy', 'hats', 'lot', 'overdone', 'drawls', 'are', 'certainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'Texan', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'accent', 'doubt', 'one', 'worst', 'attempts', 'southwestern', 'drawl', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'Yes', 'Texans', 'do', 'speak', 'drawl', 'do', 'have', 'very', 'noticeable', 'accent', 'certainly', 'included', 'everyone', 'else', 'planet', 'also', 'have', 'own', 'individual', 'speech', 'rhythms', 'occasional', 'variations', 'tone', 'pitch', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'intellectual', 'jock', 'do', 'not', 'deliver', 'sentence', 'exact', 'same', 'drawling', 'monotone', 'Still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'where', 'exactly', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'accent', 'came', 'probably', 'most', 'entertaining', 'part', 'film', 'so', 'simpleminded', 'by-the-numbers', ""n't"", 'even', 'succeed', 'achieving', 'level', 'camp', 'bad', 'movies', 'can', 'least', 'laugh', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'other', 'hand', 'one', 'dullest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'great', 'cure', 'insomnia', 'nothing', 'else']",N/A

130682,A152C8GYY25HAH,0792162617,Matthew Horner,"[0, 2]","Varsity Blues is aimed at teenagers, where it has found a sizable audience. That it was produced by MTV is reason enough for it to be fairly hip and more than a little raunchy. It begins as a scathing satire of the politics of high school football , but it nearly fumbles the theme toward the end. Still, it has its moments, won't do permanent damage to young audiences and tends to be better than most recent movies in this genre.West Cannon, Texas, a fictional place, is a community obsessed with football. The picture begins with a silent montage of home movies of little kids playing Pee Wee football. We see their parents faces contort as they yell and scream. Then we move on to the same boys playing varsity football. Coach Kilmer [Jon Voight] has lead the team to twenty-two divisional titles and two state championships. He's been there so long that he's coached some of the boys' fathers, all of whom seem to be trying to relive their glory days through their sons. The town has become blinded to the fact that Coach Kilmer is a bully, a tyrant and a bigot, whose only concern is whether or not the boys will win him another championship. They are just puppets to him.The main character, Mox, is played by teen idol James Van Der Beek from TV's Dawson's Creek. For some reason, Van Der Beek does not seem as sure of himself as he does in his TV role. His performance is hardly more than adequate. Mox is the only team player who sees the coach as he really is. Kilmer is instinctively aware of this, but when star quarterback Lance [Paul Walker] is badly injured, coach has no choice but to use Mox as a replacement. What follows is basically a battle of wills that threatens the team's chances of winning.Much of the movie works. Only Mox and his girlfriend seem interested in getting an education, but, after all, there are communities where scholastics really do take a back-seat to athletic achievements. These teens party a lot, but what's new about that? Unlike many recent films, Varsity Blues works hard to show these kids as basically worthwhile, even the ones who are far from bright or physically attractive. They care about each other. The team's eventual revolt against the coach's tyranny borders on being noble.Other elements are weak. The team visits a strip club and discovers that one of their teachers is moonlighting as a show girl. Since nothing comes of this in the movie, it is just an excuse to show some skin. The satirical elements fizzle because the writers apparently love football after all. This creates a situation where the coach must be defeated while the game has to triumph. This divided attitude weakens the plot and makes the observations from the early scenes a little hollow.",3,Energetic teen comedy nearly fumbles the ball,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,2724,"['Varsity', 'Blues', 'aimed', 'teenagers', 'where', 'found', 'sizable', 'audience', 'was', 'produced', 'MTV', 'reason', 'enough', 'be', 'fairly', 'hip', 'more', 'little', 'raunchy', 'scathing', 'satire', 'politics', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'nearly', 'theme', 'end', 'Still', 'moments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'permanent', 'damage', 'young', 'audiences', 'tends', 'be', 'better', 'most', 'recent', 'movies', 'genre.West', 'Cannon', 'Texas', 'fictional', 'place', 'community', 'obsessed', 'football', 'picture', 'silent', 'montage', 'home', 'movies', 'little', 'kids', 'playing', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'football', 'see', 'parents', 'contort', 'yell', 'scream', 'Then', 'move', 'same', 'boys', 'playing', 'varsity', 'football', 'Coach', 'Kilmer', '[', 'Jon', 'Voight', ']', 'lead', 'team', 'twenty-two', 'divisional', 'titles', 'two', 'state', 'championships', 'been', 'there', 'so', 'long', 'coached', 'boys', 'fathers', 'whom', 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'relive', 'glory', 'days', 'sons', 'town', 'become', 'blinded', 'fact', 'Coach', 'Kilmer', 'bully', 'tyrant', 'bigot', 'only', 'concern', 'not', 'boys', 'will', 'win', 'championship', 'are', 'just', 'puppets', 'him.The', 'main', 'character', 'Mox', 'played', 'teen', 'idol', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'TV', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'reason', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'not', 'seem', 'sure', 'TV', 'role', 'performance', 'hardly', 'more', 'adequate', 'Mox', 'only', 'team', 'player', 'who', 'coach', 'really', 'Kilmer', 'instinctively', 'aware', 'when', 'star', 'quarterback', 'Lance', '[', 'Paul', 'Walker', ']', 'badly', 'injured', 'coach', 'choice', 'use', 'Mox', 'replacement', 'What', 'basically', 'battle', 'wills', 'team', 'chances', 'winning.Much', 'movie', 'Only', 'Mox', 'girlfriend', 'seem', 'interested', 'getting', 'education', 'are', 'communities', 'where', 'scholastics', 'really', 'do', 'take', 'back-seat', 'athletic', 'achievements', 'teens', 'party', 'lot', 'what', 'new', 'many', 'recent', 'films', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'hard', 'show', 'kids', 'basically', 'even', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'far', 'bright', 'physically', 'attractive', 'care', 'other', 'team', 'eventual', 'revolt', 'coach', 'tyranny', 'borders', 'being', 'noble.Other', 'elements', 'are', 'weak', 'team', 'strip', 'club', 'discovers', 'one', 'teachers', 'moonlighting', 'show', 'girl', 'nothing', 'movie', 'just', 'excuse', 'show', 'skin', 'satirical', 'elements', 'fizzle', 'writers', 'apparently', 'love', 'football', 'situation', 'where', 'coach', 'must', 'be', 'defeated', 'game', 'triumph', 'divided', 'attitude', 'plot', 'observations', 'early', 'scenes', 'little', 'hollow']",N/A

The answer is simple: there are only two good  things about this movie.  First point for the patheticaly authentic setting  of a little in-the-middle-of-nowhere Texas town. The way we are shown how  all the life in this town depends and is based on football is so disgusting  that it makes you think that the rest of the world only consists of  geniuses. The other point goes to the very talented mr. Jon Voight who  plays a baddly written role magnificently.But the rest is nothing. James  Van Der Beek should've skiped this movie to keep his CV clean (his accent  is pathetic). You can predict every &quot;twist and turn&quot; of the  movie. The background music is mixed awfuly with the picture (although many  of the songs featured are good). The script is full of holes (especially  how Van Der Beek constantly changes his attitude towards football). And  jokes...my God...they can't even be called jokes (the 'religious' kid  ? ).But if you are the type of person who has never time to follow the  whole football game, then this movie is for you, cause even Super Bowl  hasn't got as nice shots of it as this one.

I wasn't expecting a great movie, but I really was amazed at how cliche nearly each scene actually was. Not real depth in any of the adult characters. That is the way most high school  movies are. The kids know exactly how to act, and the adults are crazy  stereotypes. Why not give us a reason why the Jon Voight character is so  sadistic. We know there are guys out there like them(Bobby Knight, Woody  Hayes) but give us a backstory instead of turning him to a cartoon.I  will say this. The character played by the large kid(I can't remember his  name in the movie) actually could have been a cliche, but it wasn't. It was  played rather touchingly by this young actor....but once again when there  could have been some sort of payoff between this kid and the coach or with  James Van Der Beek's character, it fizzled away. Maybe the filmakers were  too scared to have the kid kill himself or attempt to shoot the  coach....either of those scenarios would have been better than his speech  that wound up being about nothing.So why am I giving this film three  stars?

Zwick,"[4, 9]","&quot;Varsity Blues&quot; is a tedious, shallow and formulaic tale of smalltown high school football hijinks wherein the adults are even more  developmentally disabled than the hormone-crazed teenagers they've  produced.The film manages to encompass just about every cliche of this  wellworn genre. There is, for instance, the maniacal coach, driving his  players to dangerous extremes on the field and circumventing sound medical  advice for his own personal glory.  Then we have the overbearing fathers  obsessively attempting to recapture their former glory through their  pumped-up progeny.  Don't forget the crybaby fat boy who throws up buckets  of food at the seemingly numberless drunken orgies the boys participate in.  What about the sensible boy whose head is not turned by sudden fame and  fortune, and the supportive football-hating girlfriend who tries to keep  her sweetie in tow despite his sudden ascension to the rank of football  hero? All this doesn't take into account the bubbleheaded sexpot, sex ed  teacher who moonlights at the local strip joint; the befuddled cops; the  drunken, smartmouthed jock who hijacks a cop car and spends the evening  joyriding through town with a bevy of naked, nubile girls from the  neighborhood, or the horny young lady who dresses down and splashes on a  whipped cream bikini only to be rejected by the pure-in-heart hero. Then we  arrive at the final game and the unconvincing showdown between the  villainous coach and the righteously rebellious players led by the hero  Moxon. Who will be victorious? If you have to ask, perhaps this is your  first time at one of these movies.As this is an MTV movie production,  the football scenes are, of course, pumped up with a blaring rock  soundtrack that tries in vain to get the adrenalin flowing and the emotions  charged.

But when the team's star quarterback (Paul Walker, before he went ""Fast and the Furious"") is taken down and injured on a play, the duty gets passed to backup QB Jonathan ""Mox"" Moxon (James Van Der Beek), who is more concerned with proving himself academically than on the field.When Moxon shows that he's no bench-warmer and leads the team while showing compassion for his fallen teammate and his active players, his down-home charm and unconventional tactics on the field (like setting a hook-and-ladder play using the team's 350-pound linebacker) clash with Kilmer's take no prisoners attitude.Add on the fact that he has to deal with trying to maintain his relationship with his girlfriend and dealing with the new celebrity that comes with his success on the field, while avoiding the advances of a cheerleader who just happens to be the girlfriend of his friend (Ali Larter)and the fact that his is trying to escape from under the shadow of his father who also played under Kilmer and you get a guy that has the biggest task in bringing the championship home while showing that one individual can make the ultimate difference.This film has moments and plot points that to many may seem extremely hokey (Admit it...don't we all wish we had or remember that one teacher that we WISHED was an exotic dancer on the side?), and some moments contain elements that might seem just unintentionally appropos (During the scene when Ali's character tries to seduce Mox with the now-famous whipped-cream ""bikini"" the song If Your Girl Only Knew by Aaliyah played in the background.  Coincidence?  I think not...), but this is what Friday Night Lights would become 6 years later...a feel-good movie with the right tough of angst and fun in one sweet package.SO if you want a little bit of FNL with a laugh or two thrown in for good measure, the hit the field for a case of the Varsity Blues...",4,"Consider this Friday Night Lights, with an fun touch to it",1112572800,"04 4, 2005",2005,2374,"['Varsity', 'Blues', 'was', 'late', '1990s', 'moviegoer', 'what', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'today', 'movie-watcher', 'ultimate', 'underdog', 'story', 'team', 'Texas', 'who', 'can', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'tossed', 'field', 'prove', 'are', 'best', 'around.The', 'film', 'kids', 'who', 'play', 'West', 'Camen', 'Coyotes', 'who', 'are', 'making', 'way', 'trying', 'win', '23rd', 'State', 'football', 'championship', 'last', '30', 'years', 'hard-nosed', 'coach', 'Bud', 'Kilmer', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'when', 'team', 'star', 'quarterback', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'went', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'taken', 'down', 'injured', 'play', 'duty', 'passed', 'backup', 'QB', 'Jonathan', 'Mox', 'Moxon', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'who', 'more', 'concerned', 'proving', 'academically', 'field.When', 'Moxon', 'bench-warmer', 'team', 'showing', 'compassion', 'fallen', 'teammate', 'active', 'players', 'down-home', 'charm', 'unconventional', 'tactics', 'field', 'setting', 'hook-and-ladder', 'play', 'using', 'team', '350-pound', 'linebacker', 'clash', 'Kilmer', 'take', 'prisoners', 'attitude.Add', 'fact', 'deal', 'trying', 'maintain', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'dealing', 'new', 'celebrity', 'success', 'field', 'avoiding', 'advances', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'friend', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'fact', 'trying', 'escape', 'shadow', 'father', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'Kilmer', 'get', 'guy', 'biggest', 'task', 'bringing', 'championship', 'home', 'showing', 'one', 'individual', 'can', 'make', 'ultimate', 'difference.This', 'film', 'moments', 'plot', 'points', 'many', 'may', 'seem', 'extremely', 'hokey', 'Admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'had', 'remember', 'one', 'teacher', 'WISHED', 'was', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'side', 'moments', 'contain', 'elements', 'might', 'seem', 'just', 'unintentionally', 'appropos', 'scene', 'when', 'Ali', 'character', 'tries', 'seduce', 'Mox', 'now-famous', 'whipped-cream', 'bikini', 'song', 'Girl', 'Only', 'Knew', 'Aaliyah', 'played', 'background', 'Coincidence', 'think', 'not', 'what', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'would', 'become', '6', 'years', 'later', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'right', 'tough', 'angst', 'fun', 'one', 'sweet', 'package.SO', 'want', 'little', 'bit', 'FNL', 'laugh', 'two', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'hit', 'field', 'case', 'Varsity', 'Blues']",N/A

130707,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0792162617,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","""Varsity Blues"" (1999) is a sports film about football in East Texas, where high school football is virtually a religion. I was surprised at how engrossing and entertaining ""Varsity Blues"" is, much more so than similar films, like ""Remember the Titans"" (2000) and scores of others.The story revolves around a second-string quarterback, Mox (James Van Der Beek), who doesn't take football too seriously because he's consigned to the bench, but when the team's star-quarterback is seriously injured (Paul Walker), Mox rises to the challenge and begins to experience all the perks that come with being the football hero of the town.I'm not a huge fan of sports film, unless they successfully tap into other genres. ""Varsity Blues"" does this and is part high school dramedy. The movie features everything you'd want in a film of this ilk -- the sexpot cheerleader (Ali Larter), wild schoolmates (Scott Caan, Ron Lester), the smart girl (Amy Smart, no pun intended), wild parties, miscellaneous coming-of-age antics, megalomaniac coach (Jon Voight) and everything that goes with intense sports competition.Some people complain that the film's unrealistic because of all the extreme things that occur, but the team in ""Varsity Blues"" represents the typical champion high school football team and therefore they experience the various crazy things these types of teams encounter in real life. It was the same thing with ""Platoon."" Veterans of Vietnam say no one platoon would undergo all that this platoon experienced, but the group is a microcosm of all platoons throughout the Vietnam war. It also might come across as ""too much"" because filmmakers only have about 2 hours to tell the story and they have to jam a whole year of experiences into that time frame.Others complain about the lack of assistant coaches in the second half of the final game, but we'll have to assume that they went with a certain person and the film just doesn't show it.I rate ""Varsity Blues"" as high as I do because it's a stand-out sports film and high school dramedy. No genre is beyond redemption or beneath contempt.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in the Austin, TX, area (Georgetown, Elgin and Taylor).GRADE: A-",5,Very entertaining sports movie,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,2196,"['Varsity', 'Blues', '1999', 'sports', 'film', 'football', 'East', 'Texas', 'where', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'virtually', 'religion', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'engrossing', 'entertaining', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'similar', 'films', 'Remember', 'Titans', '2000', 'scores', 'others.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'second-string', 'quarterback', 'Mox', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'who', ""n't"", 'take', 'football', 'too', 'seriously', 'consigned', 'bench', 'when', 'team', 'star-quarterback', 'seriously', 'injured', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Mox', 'challenge', 'experience', 'perks', 'come', 'being', 'football', 'hero', 'town.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'sports', 'film', 'successfully', 'tap', 'other', 'genres', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'part', 'high', 'school', 'dramedy', 'movie', 'everything', ""'d"", 'want', 'film', 'ilk', 'sexpot', 'cheerleader', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'wild', 'schoolmates', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'Ron', 'Lester', 'smart', 'girl', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'pun', 'intended', 'wild', 'parties', 'miscellaneous', 'coming-of-age', 'antics', 'megalomaniac', 'coach', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'everything', 'intense', 'sports', 'competition.Some', 'people', 'complain', 'film', 'unrealistic', 'extreme', 'things', 'occur', 'team', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'typical', 'champion', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'therefore', 'experience', 'various', 'crazy', 'things', 'types', 'teams', 'encounter', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'same', 'thing', 'Platoon', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'say', 'one', 'platoon', 'would', 'undergo', 'platoon', 'experienced', 'group', 'microcosm', 'platoons', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'also', 'might', 'come', 'too', 'much', 'filmmakers', 'only', 'have', 'about', '2', 'hours', 'tell', 'story', 'have', 'jam', 'whole', 'year', 'experiences', 'time', 'frame.Others', 'complain', 'lack', 'assistant', 'coaches', 'second', 'half', 'final', 'game', ""'ll"", 'have', 'assume', 'went', 'certain', 'person', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'show', 'it.I', 'rate', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'as', 'high', 'do', 'stand-out', 'sports', 'film', 'high', 'school', 'dramedy', 'genre', 'redemption', 'beneath', 'contempt.The', 'film', '106', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'Austin', 'TX', 'area', 'Georgetown', 'Elgin', 'Taylor', '.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A
