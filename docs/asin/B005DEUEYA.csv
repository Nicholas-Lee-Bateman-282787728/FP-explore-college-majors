1455527,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005DEUEYA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[13, 16]","If you are a fan of the likable Meagan Good, there is probably no stopping you from checking out ""Video Girl.""  It's easy to see why the actress was attracted to the project--in fact, she actively participated in getting the film made and takes a producer credit.  She is front and center in almost every scene and gets to show the many stages within a classic tale of Hollywood corruption.  It is an opportunity to show a real acting range and while the movie flounders (especially in its second half), my good will toward Good herself never waned.  The movie actually starts as a low-key charmer as Good is introduced to a new life and unexpected career, but suddenly it shifts to a rather laughable cautionary tale at the midpoint.  At fault is a cliche riddled screenplay that loses all sense of realness despite the claims that the movie is ""based on a real story.""  Seriously, some of the sequences in the ""harrowing"" second act could qualify as classic camp and made me giggle when I was supposed to be moved.Good starts out as a rather demure shopgirl who is discovered by a music video director at a bar one evening.  She visits the location shoot, participates as the lead in a rap video, and is somewhat smitten by her new friend (Adam Senn).  A quick sidenote, you probably shouldn't trust someone named Shark.  Senn invites Good out to Los Angeles and soon she is starring in all of his videos and sharing his bed.  Good, of course, becomes the toast of the town despite the fact that she displays no visible talent (not even dancing) as she is usually just the pretty face in the video.  Everyone wants to work with her--but that Senn is a meany and so selfish.  Despite the fact that he made her a star, gave her a career (again with no visible talent), and provided a posh existence--we are eventually supposed to see him as a complete villain because he's too possessive.  How can she prove she's Miss Independence?  One night out with the girls, she snorts some drugs.  She is so innocent, her friends tell her it's like coffee or sugar.  Can you really be sympathetic with such a mental midget?  She is a raging drug addict overnight and must hit bottom before all can be all right again.""Video Girl"" really wants us to root for Good, but I didn't at all.  She's a user and a brat, but the screenplay never really deals with that honestly.  In some of the most delightfully campy moments, Good is shown doing drugs in one scene in which within one minute she snorts about ten lines.  It's hilarious.  In another, the chaste (she doesn't use sex to get ahead, except that in reality she did) and naive Good is mauled by a producer.  I haven't seen such theatrics since ""Valley of the Dolls!""  Of course, this being a cautionary tale--you can only hope she will put her life together and be stronger.  I won't reveal the outcome, but can you guess?  It's all rather painful--especially life lessons by a ghostly apparition.  The beginning of ""Video Girl"" rates about 3 1/2 stars, the end about 1 star--so I'll round it all out at about 2.
