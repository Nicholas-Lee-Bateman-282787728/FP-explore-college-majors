Fraser plays a man that tries to escape his wife and her mafia family in New York by going to Ireland.  There he runs his Uncles Antique shop while he's away. Meaney plays the officer in charge at the hostage negotiations.Spoiler:  He gets caught up in the escape of a fish market robber in the shop, and to make matters worse the bag he took is wanted by the Irish mafia.  Then what he would never expect is to meet his son and grandson while he is there.

1612870,A2VP791XUP9UWN,B00AKIPALG,GJW; Florida,"[15, 16]","This movie was alot of fun to watch, and very enjoyable. It starts off a bit slow as you are introduced to the various characters, However, after that it really takes off, and the longer you watch, the better it gets. The actors were all very very good and the plot was great. The interaction between the actors makes for rich humor with out being stupid, and you never know what will happen next. So, you have humor, action, budding romance, hitmen, mob bosses, crime, upset mothers, and all kinds of wonderfull characters to enjoy. Filmed in Northern Irland, so sometimes the accents are a bit hard to understand, but not often. This movie can be viewed by the whole family. No F-bombs, no nudity, no sexual situations, and what violence there is was done with taste and consideration. If you decide to see this movie, I'll bet you will not be dissatisfied.

The script involves a young American relocated to Belfast to manage his cousin's curio shop; a young gambler indebted to a ruthless loan shark; a dedicated lawman with a son trying to follow in his dad's footsteps, and an odd assortment of village locals.It's all presented with lots of comical coincidences and physical humor.

Joe Maguire (Brendan Fraser) is watching a shop for his cousin in Ireland. Due to a number of odd circumstances Joe becomes the hostage of a young desperate man (Martin McCann) who recently robbed a crime boss (David O'Hara). As they are held up in the shop, Detective Weller (Colm Meaney) is outside negotiating.Fraser and Meany provide the proper light comedic element to this film filled with quirky characters from our stars down to the gypsy Travellers. Meany is the old fashion home spun detective, our Andy of Mayberry. He tries to keep the situation real and low key while there are other departments who make this out to be something which requires major intervention.The film also includes father/son relationships, Joe's love interest, and of course the Irish mafia. This feature is definitely worth a view. It would make for a good date night film.Parental Guide: F-bomb.

When he gets in deep to a local mob boss he has one choice. Pay him back or give him his son. With his back against the wall he decides to rob a fish market, but for a non-criminal things don't always go right. This first and foremost is a really funny comedy. Just seeing the events unfold on its own is really funny and entertaining to watch but when mixed with the dialog it makes it that much more fun to watch. This movie combines the best of British crime movies with American comedy. While this movie won't win any awards it is one of the most entertaining movies that I have seen in a while and I recommend this. The type of movie you can just put in and not really have to think about, just watch and enjoy. I liked it. Overall, very entertaining and very much worth seeing.
