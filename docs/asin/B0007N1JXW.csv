883673,A3KWS5OMNZ7OPN,B0007N1JXW,"John Romero ""gentermart""","[9, 9]","This is a wonderful movie of human determination, love, passion, and betrayal.  It keeps you on your feet as the story is told switching back and forth from the past to the present.  Maxi (Valerie Bertinelli) is a very colorful and dynamic character.  Her ability to switch from a spoiled brat to a business woman gives her quite an insight into the real world.  Not having daddy to bail her out or anywhere to run after her failed marriages teaches her to grow up and to make concesions in life.  Rocco (Jack Sealia) one of Maxi's husbands has also a hand in her understanding the real world.  Maxi's determination in that her coniving uncle Cutter Amberville ( Perry King) does not destroy the magazine empire her father built and in not losing Rocco forever makes this a movie to watch.  All the actors are wonderful and you just love to hate Perry King.  All in all this is a movie to watch.  It raise many different emotions once you see it.",4,Intrguingly Naughty,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,946,"['wonderful', 'movie', 'human', 'determination', 'love', 'passion', 'betrayal', 'feet', 'story', 'told', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'past', 'present', 'Maxi', 'Valerie', 'Bertinelli', 'very', 'colorful', 'dynamic', 'character', 'ability', 'switch', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'business', 'woman', 'quite', 'insight', 'real', 'world', 'Not', 'having', 'daddy', 'bail', 'out', 'anywhere', 'run', 'failed', 'marriages', 'grow', 'up', 'make', 'concesions', 'life', 'Rocco', 'Jack', 'Sealia', 'one', 'Maxi', 'husbands', 'also', 'hand', 'understanding', 'real', 'world', 'Maxi', 'determination', 'coniving', 'uncle', 'Cutter', 'Amberville', 'Perry', 'King', 'not', 'destroy', 'magazine', 'empire', 'father', 'built', 'not', 'losing', 'Rocco', 'forever', 'movie', 'watch', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'just', 'love', 'hate', 'Perry', 'King', 'movie', 'watch', 'raise', 'many', 'different', 'emotions', 'once', 'see']",I'll Take Manhattan
883674,A3AUIEYL3Z9QNK,B0007N1JXW,"Laura Christine ""Jewel of Zion""","[3, 3]","It is ironic that I absolutely loved a short list of Judith Krantz novels, but this was not one of them.  This is the rare time that the film was better than the book.There are eight hours of storyline and a lot of stars to cover, so here is a top ten list of highlights:1) Perry King played a real SOB, but at the same time he was very handsome and hot.  To see a young Perry King, check out the Lords of Flatbush with Sly Stallone.2) Francesca Annis played a great matriarch with a fabulous voice and Euro accent.  No wonder Ralph Fiennes had a long-term involvement with her even though she was many years his senior.3) Although I dislike both smoking and fighting, Barry Bostwick was hot with a cigarette dangling from his mouth as he taught a lesson to some thugs.4) Valerie Bertinelli had a section of hair stripped to white when she pursued this role.  Both Zachary and Maxi had this trait in the book.5) Thanks to this film I developed a bit of a crush on Adam Storke.  I'm not sure how he managed this as he was playing a gay character.6) Jack Scalia once played baseball for the Montreal Expos.7) I never have figured out the name of the actress who played Candace.  She broke my heart with her fine acting, vulnerability, and ultimate tragic demise.8) This film triggered my appreciation for Ella Fitzgerald who sang the theme song with her fabulous smoky voice.9) Doug Davidson from the Young & the Restless played a character that had no problem consorting with men or serving a jail sentence so long as the price was right.10) Tim Daly was handsome in his role.  He played Joe in Wings.This miniseries is a great escape into the world of the wealthy.  It was well-cast and the soundtrack was good.  It is essentially a soap, but soap can be a good thing.",5,Eight Hours of Decadent Fun,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,1768,"['ironic', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'short', 'list', 'Judith', 'Krantz', 'novels', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'rare', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'book.There', 'are', 'eight', 'hours', 'storyline', 'lot', 'stars', 'cover', 'so', 'here', 'top', 'ten', 'list', 'highlights:1', 'Perry', 'King', 'played', 'real', 'SOB', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'handsome', 'hot', 'see', 'young', 'Perry', 'King', 'check', 'out', 'Lords', 'Flatbush', 'Sly', 'Stallone.2', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'played', 'great', 'matriarch', 'fabulous', 'voice', 'Euro', 'accent', 'wonder', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'had', 'long-term', 'involvement', 'even', 'was', 'many', 'years', 'senior.3', 'dislike', 'smoking', 'fighting', 'Barry', 'Bostwick', 'was', 'hot', 'cigarette', 'dangling', 'mouth', 'taught', 'lesson', 'thugs.4', 'Valerie', 'Bertinelli', 'had', 'section', 'hair', 'stripped', 'white', 'when', 'pursued', 'role', 'Zachary', 'Maxi', 'had', 'trait', 'book.5', 'film', 'developed', 'bit', 'crush', 'Adam', 'Storke', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'managed', 'was', 'playing', 'gay', 'character.6', 'Jack', 'Scalia', 'once', 'played', 'baseball', 'Montreal', 'Expos.7', 'never', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'name', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Candace', 'broke', 'heart', 'fine', 'acting', 'vulnerability', 'ultimate', 'tragic', 'demise.8', 'film', 'triggered', 'appreciation', 'Ella', 'Fitzgerald', 'who', 'sang', 'theme', 'song', 'fabulous', 'smoky', 'voice.9', 'Doug', 'Davidson', 'Young', 'Restless', 'played', 'character', 'had', 'problem', 'consorting', 'men', 'serving', 'jail', 'sentence', 'so', 'long', 'price', 'was', 'right.10', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'was', 'handsome', 'role', 'played', 'Joe', 'Wings.This', 'miniseries', 'great', 'escape', 'world', 'wealthy', 'was', 'well-cast', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'good', 'essentially', 'soap', 'soap', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing']",I'll Take Manhattan

Maxi {Valerie Bertinelli} gives you a charactor you'd just love to be. From the spoiled brat, to the resposible woman who comes out a winner all the way around. I first saw this on t.v. Never dreamed they'd make it into a dvd. I am so glad they did! It's a long movie but when I started to watch it...everything else went by the way side. I couldn't NOT watch it. Back then, you couldn't fast forward through all the commercials. Now I can pause it and get a pop or whatever and come back to my beloved movie. By all means buy this.
