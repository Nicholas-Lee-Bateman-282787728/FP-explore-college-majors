I don't know if it was because there was no more Hef or no more playboy mansion or what.! Holly was always my favorite and has such a funny quirky personality but this new hollys world show and the setting didn't appeal to me! Im pretty sure it was just the huge difference life had on her after she left the mansion!!,2,I absolutely love holly but HOLLYS WORLD ..was boring!!!!,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,414,"['loved', 'girls', 'door', 'so', 'much', 'still', 'watch', 'date', 'never', 'got', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'was', 'more', 'Hef', 'more', 'playboy', 'mansion', 'what.', 'Holly', 'was', 'always', 'favorite', 'such', 'funny', 'quirky', 'personality', 'new', 'hollys', 'world', 'show', 'setting', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'Im', 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', 'just', 'huge', 'difference', 'life', 'had', 'left', 'mansion']",Holly's World: Seasons 1 & 2

Holly has really grown on me, but I love Josh and the assistant best. I really dislike Laura and the new mean-girl Playmate Jayde. She is so annoying and I was glad when she got punched. This show is definitely a guilty pleasure, so if you like to laugh and scream out loud at gossipy fun shows, you will love this! So so so much fun.

The show is great fun to watch and I really enjoy watching it over and over again, when I can get away from my kids. There is not a lot of nudity, which is great, but there is  no edited language option on the dvds, and the amount of language some times gets ridiculous. The characters are entertaining, and Angel is such a sweetie!! I didn't care for Laura Croft though, as she has this bimbo/airheaded thing going for her, and you can tell that some of its an act, but other times you want to reach thru the TV and shake her. Jade's character brings a little drama to the show, which is fun. All in all, if you likes the GND series, you'll enjoy this show. I just wish there were commentary and the option to edit the language on the disks.

Became a fan because I liked Bridget & Holly.I do enjoy the show.  Here it is uncut so we get the language.  Good the episodes are wide screen.The seasons were TOO SHORT.  Favorite episode in season one was Bridget's episode where the take the trip. And, I agree with what Holly said, her bobble head looked like a man.Of course season two as short as it was is better.  We got to see the whole Hef getting engaged to ""The Runaway Bride"".  The other parts this season is that Jadye person causing problems and the fight with Angel and Josh finding his real mother.You can tell some of this is staged.  Good to see VegasWhat a cheap DVD package.  The same photo of her on all three DVD's.  NO episode information listed anywhere.
