1111263,A26HDM444XEZ8J,B000WQ9EFO,Ummm no,"[16, 18]","The series is from the early 1990's so i wonder if many younger people will appreciate the jokes. Comical quips about reagan, bush sr., exxon valdez, etcetera.the comedy is rather raw, meaning the show was fundamentally built around making something funny, not politically correct.sadly that and copyrights butchered the series.the musical performances at the end of the show are on the disc, but i can't remember enough of the show to tell what else is missing.a quick wiki look and online search can answer far better than i, but i will say that one of the funniest sketches was demolished. there is a sketch called men on film.that skit is about two homosexual men reviewing various things, and in this case, they are commenting on a super bowl game during half time. the performance was done live and was extremely funny, but offensive to some celebrities. it also grabbed a HUGE, in the double digits of millions huge amount of viewers from the super bowls own half time show.now what's left is still funny, but lacking the omg, he didn't just say that moments.basically for anyone with a good memory and old enough to remember 1980-1990ish pop culture should be able to appreciate the jokes. best way to discern if this series is for you is to look on youtube or some other online video site and view some of the clips of this shows work.i believe without this television series, shows like madtv could not have come around. this show even has the prototype vancome lady.i'll also warn people that this show isn't overly friendly to the caucasian populace. as someone who was raised in the similar areas and double standards as the waynes brothers i can understand and laugh at some of the jokes about whitey/the man and what not, but i have met some people who are out right insulted by the jokes and considered them racially prejudiced. the show does ridicule many races but even kenan (the producer) even admits they focused on whites. therefore if whoever is reading this is white and can't take a joke, don't bother buying this series. luckily my caramel butt can laugh at all the stupidity from every race.finally, this complaint isn't serious as it is just a minor peeve of mine, but the theme song becomes quite annoying after a few episodes (or sooner), so if you don't like it, keep the remote close. sadly too, the skip chapter buttons don't automatically go from one skit to the next, sometimes the skip buttons will cross over 2 or more sketches at a time.**************EDIT************************The few sketches I remember that are missing include:-Billy Dee Williams date rape sketch.-Snow Imposter parody.-Michael Jacksons am I
