281870,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6301971191,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[32, 36]","With an uncanny resemblance to the self-portraits of Vincent Van Gogh, Kirk Douglas is perfect for this detailed and wonderful production of the artist's life; it's a passionate performance of a troubled soul, whose creative urges battled with his mental illness.The film has an intelligent script by Norman Corwin, based on Irving Stone's biographical novel. It picks up the story around 1879, when Van Gogh was 26 years old, and went to minister (unsuccessfully) to the coal miners of a destitute area, and from there takes us through his many different abodes, his relationship with &quot;Christine&quot;, who is well played by Pamela Brown, and the flourishing of his art in his last 15 years of life.The art direction is superb, and the recreations of the places Van Gogh painted a marvel, among them the famous yellow house he lived in and its bedroom, and my favorite, the pool hall, with its hanging lamps.The cinematography by Freddy Young and Russell Harlan is terrific, and we get many full screen views of the original paintings, many of them lesser known pieces from private collections.This was a multi-award winning film, and garnered an Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Anthony Quinn, who is fabulous as Paul Gauguin, whose personality was the complete opposite of his friend Van Gogh; the ego clashes when they attempted to live together are well illustrated in several scenes, and with a little addition to his nose, Quinn has been made to look exactly like Gauguin's famous self-portrait with the snake.James Donald is excellent as Vincent's patient and generous brother, who was Van Gogh's central means of support for most of his lifetime, both financially and of his paintings.A tremendous knowledge about art went into this film, and it's one of the best artist biographies ever put to film (another good one also came from a Stone best seller, &quot;The Agony and the Ecstasy&quot;), and is a must-see for artists and anyone with an interest in Van Gogh's genius.

281871,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301971191,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 3]","Vincente Minnelli took on the tumultuous life of famed painter Vincent Van Gogh in this acclaimed 1956 film, `Lust for Life'.  I was extremely excited by the promise this movie held and settled in, finally, to watching it over the weekend.  What I found was a disappointment of sorts, a film that never really capitalized on that said `passion' and produced a film that felt uneven and surprisingly un-textured; a plain almost flaccid depiction of a life lived to the full (but not in a necessarily `good' kind of way).Kirk Douglas tries to find shades of Van Gogh's madness but winds up coming across like a mere caricature, lost in the segments that are not as clearly defined or strung together as they needed to be.  The film is also admittedly NOT a direct biopic, decidedly fudging facts and delivering a fictional portrait of the man.  This fact makes the film even more disappointing, for it really had the liberties to go all out and make the most of the film's title.  It didn't.  For a guy who loves the biopic, `Lust for Life' nearly bored me to tears.  The way that the subject was handled feels so lazy and uninspired.Thank god for Anthony Quinn who does nothing of real note and yet at least struts his stuff in a scene or two and captures our attention.  His Oscar win is a joke, especially when you consider that Robert Stack was also a nominee, but at least he was fun.The visual grainy nature of the film takes away from the overall impact and also contradicts the visual allure (or should I say `mental allure') of a film about a painter such as Van Gogh.  I was also surprised at how little depth this film offered, giving us little reason to invest in Van Gogh's life and really no reason to care much for how it all panned out.

281874,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,6301971191,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[10, 11]","""Lust for Life"", Vincente Minnelli's rich interpretation of Irving Stone's Vincent Van Gogh bio-novel, is a film both compelling and repelling; in delving into the psyche of the artist (unforgettably portrayed by Kirk Douglas), one can see an untrained, unbridled genius smashing convention to open viewers' eyes to a world defined by passion; yet in doing so, we share in the growing nightmares and agony of his creative mind, teetering toward the madness that would destroy him, and it is an unsettling experience, to be sure!This is a film so rich in visual imagery (with a Technicolor 'palette' that attempts to recreate Van Gogh's view of his world), that it demands repeated viewings, just to savor the details. From wheat fields 'aflame' in color, to night skies that nearly writhe in waves of darkness, the elemental nature of the artist's vision is spectacularly captured. And in experiencing the world through his eyes, the loving, yet uncomprehending concern of his brother (James Donald), and more hedonistic, shallow patronizing, and gradual disgust of fellow artist Paul Gauguin (Anthony Quinn, in his Oscar-winning performance), become elemental 'barriers', as well. Van Gogh wants to 'speak', but no one can understand his 'language', not even the artist, himself!This film deserves a wealth of bonus features, yet the DVD offers only a very dry audio commentary, by film historian Dr. Drew Casper, which sounds like one of those college lectures I used to sleep through! MGM produced a wonderful documentary, when the film was made, about the production, locations, and reactions of locals, who knew Van Gogh, of Kirk Douglas' dead-on appearance and portrayal. Why this was not included is a mystery, as it provides the kind of insights Casper's comments don't!Kirk Douglas never plunged as deeply into a portrayal as he did, in ""Lust for Life"", and the experience nearly crushed him, as he related in his autobiography, ""Ragman's Son"". His total immersion in the role SHOULD have won him an Oscar (Yul Brynner won, instead, for ""The King and I""), and his bitterness and disappointment at the snub would haunt him, to this day. With the passage of time, his performance has only increased in luster and stature, and it certainly shows an actor at the top of his form!""Lust for Life"" is an unforgettable experience, not to be missed, even if this edition is lacking in 'extras'!",5,"Brilliant, Yet  Painful Classic Offers Douglas' Finest Performance...",1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,2394,"['Lust', 'Life', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'rich', 'interpretation', 'Irving', 'Stone', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'bio-novel', 'film', 'compelling', 'repelling', 'delving', 'psyche', 'artist', 'unforgettably', 'portrayed', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'untrained', 'unbridled', 'genius', 'smashing', 'convention', 'open', 'viewers', 'eyes', 'world', 'defined', 'passion', 'yet', 'doing', 'so', 'share', 'growing', 'nightmares', 'agony', 'creative', 'mind', 'teetering', 'madness', 'would', 'destroy', 'unsettling', 'experience', 'be', 'sure', 'film', 'so', 'rich', 'visual', 'imagery', 'Technicolor', ""'palette"", 'recreate', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'view', 'world', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'just', 'savor', 'details', 'wheat', 'fields', 'color', 'night', 'skies', 'nearly', 'writhe', 'waves', 'darkness', 'elemental', 'nature', 'artist', 'vision', 'spectacularly', 'captured', 'experiencing', 'world', 'eyes', 'loving', 'yet', 'uncomprehending', 'concern', 'brother', 'James', 'Donald', 'more', 'hedonistic', 'shallow', 'patronizing', 'gradual', 'disgust', 'fellow', 'artist', 'Paul', 'Gauguin', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'become', 'elemental', ""'barriers"", 'well', 'Van', 'Gogh', ""'speak"", 'one', 'can', 'understand', ""'language"", 'not', 'even', 'artist', 'film', 'wealth', 'bonus', 'features', 'yet', 'DVD', 'only', 'very', 'dry', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'historian', 'Dr.', 'Drew', 'Casper', 'one', 'college', 'used', 'sleep', 'MGM', 'produced', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'production', 'locations', 'reactions', 'locals', 'who', 'knew', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'dead-on', 'appearance', 'portrayal', 'Why', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'mystery', 'kind', 'insights', 'Casper', 'comments', 'do', ""n't"", 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'never', 'plunged', 'deeply', 'portrayal', 'did', 'Lust', 'Life', 'experience', 'nearly', 'crushed', 'related', 'autobiography', 'Ragman', 'Son', 'total', 'immersion', 'role', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'won', 'instead', 'King', 'bitterness', 'disappointment', 'snub', 'would', 'haunt', 'day', 'passage', 'time', 'performance', 'only', 'increased', 'luster', 'stature', 'certainly', 'actor', 'top', 'form', 'Lust', 'Life', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'even', 'edition', 'lacking', ""'extras""]",Lust for Life VHS

To prove this, all anyone need ever do is to partake of the engrossing, frequently wounding, experience of viewing Vincente Minnelli's 1956 masterpiece, Lust For Life. As Douglas channels the tormented soul of the tragic artist Vincent Van Gogh, Minnelli's camera pans across the strikingly gorgeous countryside of rural France, every bit as hypnotically stunning in the 1950's as it surely was for the impressionists of the nineteenth-century. Lust For Life is a meticulous labor of love, admiration, and obvious respect that still manages to treat its central character without the reverence that would have weakened the impact of its subject matter. No lurid tabloidesque tell-all oozing drama for shock value, Lust For Life gives audiences an up close view of Van Gogh's incarnation as he himself must have felt it happening. At times a helpless victim of disorder and circumstance, at others a commanding genius able to convey his own higher vision of supercharged reality, Van Gogh as interpreted by Douglas is surely one of the screen's most engaging figures.

But in due time, Missionary Society representatives denounce his missionary work as demeaning to the clergy  because he insists on living at the same level as the people and giving them his possessions. He, in turn,denounces them as hyprocites.After some time on his own, his brother, Theo(James Donald)finds him,  and brings him home, making an effort to sell his paintings. At home, we see his tempestuous relationship with his father (Henry Daniell), and his attraction to his newly widowed cousin, Kay( Jeanette Starke), and her young son, Jan(Mickey Maza), who fuel his artistic creativity for a while. But when the lonely painter becomes too instant on marriage, he loses them both. A confrontational scene at her parents' home reveals signs of madness.He later encounters a lonely laundress named Christine(Pamela Brown)in a bar. They quickly take up residence together, and he looks after her infant son as though he were his own. But due to Vincent's inability  to support them, that relationship also falls apart.After the death of their father, Theo invites Vincent to live in Paris to see what other artists are doing. Among the prominent artists that he meets are Camille Pissarro (David Leonard), Georges Seurat (David Bond), and Paul Gaugin( Anthony Quinn), the last of whom later stays with Van Gogh at his house in Arles for a time.Van Gogh also finds friendship with the postman, Roulin (Niall MacGuinnis), and the action in the story is moved along via the recital of Vincent's letters to the unflinchingly dedicated Theo.Directors Vincent Minnelli, and George Cukor successfully capture Van Gogh's world, and give light to what inspired the contents of the Impressionist's canvases. We see this in the gold light of Arles, as created by the sun on the wheat fields, the blossoms of the trees, and the lights of the city at night time, which figure in the painting, ""Starry Night"".The main self-inflicted crisis of Vincent's life takes place after a feud with Gaugin. The two appear as an Impressionist Era Oscar Madison and  Felix Unger until Gaugin walks away from a feud, and Van Gogh pursues him with a razor blade for a time before returning to his apartment and severing his own ear. The tortured scream resulting from this calamity is the scream of all agonized humanity.Checking himself into a mental hospital at Saint-Remy, he finds new inspiration for his work, but continues to suffer from seizures and paranoia. Marion Ross has a few brief scenes as Sister Clotilde at this juncture.Although still suffering from seizures, Van Gogh decides to create his final painting, ""Crows Over the Wheat Field"" which has both brilliant and dark symbolism.The film accurately recreates Van Gogh's acquaintances, such as Dr. Gachet(Everett Sloane) who were immortalized on canvas, and gives a considerable portrayal of those closest to Van Gogh, such as his sister, Willhelmien (Jill Bennett).All in all, skillful direction and fine performances move the troubled life of Vincent Van Gogh past its dark ending and give it new illumination, and we see how Theo Van Gogh's belief in his brother's artistic ability has ultimately paid off.",5,"Brilliant Colors, Solemn Reverence, and Brotherly Devotion",1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,3790,"['one', 'finest', 'performances', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'dead-on', 'very', 'intense', 'portrayal', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'capturing', 'brilliance', 'madness', 'doomed', 'artist', 'perfection.We', 'first', 'encounter', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'idealistic', 'young', 'man', 'refusing', 'accept', 'society', 'Belgian', 'missionaries', 'have', 'rejected', 'application', 'be', 'used', 'society', 'way', 'possible', 'board', 'time', 'lowly', 'miners', 'potato', 'gatherers', 'first', 'paintings', 'Dutch', 'Peasant', 'Woman', 'Potato', 'Eaters', 'colors', 'are', 'dark', 'muted', 'earth', 'tones', 'figures', 'are', 'careworn', 'due', 'time', 'Missionary', 'Society', 'representatives', 'denounce', 'missionary', 'work', 'demeaning', 'clergy', 'living', 'same', 'level', 'people', 'giving', 'possessions', 'turn', 'hyprocites.After', 'time', 'own', 'brother', 'Theo', 'James', 'Donald', 'home', 'making', 'effort', 'sell', 'paintings', 'home', 'see', 'tempestuous', 'relationship', 'father', 'Henry', 'Daniell', 'attraction', 'newly', 'widowed', 'cousin', 'Kay', 'Jeanette', 'Starke', 'young', 'son', 'Jan', 'Mickey', 'Maza', 'who', 'fuel', 'artistic', 'creativity', 'while', 'when', 'lonely', 'painter', 'becomes', 'too', 'instant', 'marriage', 'confrontational', 'scene', 'parents', 'home', 'reveals', 'signs', 'madness.He', 'later', 'lonely', 'laundress', 'named', 'Christine', 'Pamela', 'Brown', 'bar', 'quickly', 'take', 'up', 'residence', 'together', 'infant', 'son', 'were', 'own', 'due', 'Vincent', 'inability', 'support', 'relationship', 'also', 'death', 'father', 'Theo', 'Vincent', 'live', 'Paris', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'artists', 'are', 'doing', 'prominent', 'artists', 'are', 'Camille', 'Pissarro', 'David', 'Leonard', 'Georges', 'Seurat', 'David', 'Bond', 'Paul', 'Gaugin', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'last', 'whom', 'later', 'stays', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'house', 'Arles', 'time.Van', 'Gogh', 'also', 'friendship', 'postman', 'Roulin', 'Niall', 'MacGuinnis', 'action', 'story', 'moved', 'recital', 'Vincent', 'letters', 'unflinchingly', 'dedicated', 'Theo.Directors', 'Vincent', 'Minnelli', 'George', 'Cukor', 'successfully', 'capture', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'world', 'give', 'light', 'what', 'inspired', 'contents', 'Impressionist', 'canvases', 'see', 'gold', 'light', 'Arles', 'created', 'sun', 'wheat', 'fields', 'blossoms', 'trees', 'lights', 'city', 'night', 'time', 'figure', 'painting', 'Starry', 'Night', '.The', 'main', 'self-inflicted', 'crisis', 'Vincent', 'life', 'place', 'feud', 'Gaugin', 'two', 'appear', 'Impressionist', 'Era', 'Oscar', 'Madison', 'Felix', 'Unger', 'Gaugin', 'walks', 'away', 'feud', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'razor', 'blade', 'time', 'returning', 'apartment', 'severing', 'own', 'ear', 'tortured', 'scream', 'resulting', 'calamity', 'scream', 'agonized', 'humanity.Checking', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Saint-Remy', 'new', 'inspiration', 'work', 'suffer', 'seizures', 'paranoia', 'Marion', 'Ross', 'few', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Sister', 'Clotilde', 'juncture.Although', 'still', 'suffering', 'seizures', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'create', 'final', 'painting', 'Wheat', 'Field', 'brilliant', 'dark', 'symbolism.The', 'film', 'accurately', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'acquaintances', 'such', 'Dr.', 'Gachet', 'Everett', 'Sloane', 'who', 'were', 'immortalized', 'canvas', 'considerable', 'portrayal', 'closest', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'such', 'sister', 'Willhelmien', 'Jill', 'Bennett', '.All', 'skillful', 'direction', 'fine', 'performances', 'move', 'troubled', 'life', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'dark', 'ending', 'give', 'new', 'illumination', 'see', 'how', 'Theo', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'belief', 'brother', 'artistic', 'ability', 'ultimately', 'paid', 'off']",Lust for Life VHS

281889,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,6301971191,J from NY,"[7, 8]","Critics lambasted Kirk Douglas' performance as ""hammy"".  I don't see that at all.  This is, without a doubt, the Vincent Van Gogh that we read in ""Letters To Theo"" miraculously brought to life.As with Van Gogh's actual life, the whole thing has a kind of creaking bipolarity to it; he has periods of creative bliss, happiness and fulfillment, but they are too short and his almost unbearable intensity gets him into trouble too often with too many people who can help him.  Anthony Quinn as Paul Gaughan would seem like a strange fit, but he pulls it off pretty well; you can feel the arguments crashing between them like thunderstorms, and Vincent's unwavering belief in their friendship is so innocent and enthusiastic that one cannot help but feel heartbroken when it ends so terribly.  Douglas communicates vividly what we suspect about Van Gogh from reading his correspondences, and from his paintings; that he was far too visionary to ever really make it in the practical world, or overcome his restlessness long enough to allow his art to mature.The beginning of the film more than any other sequence shows how violently alienated Van Gogh was from coteries and social mores.  His doomed-from-the-start mission to be a minister ends ironically--he was too Christian for the Christians.  While there is an explosion underground and poverty-stricken children die along with the very miner who introduced him to their real hellish existence, he is reprimanded by his spiritual ""superiors"" for dressing incorrectly.  Van Gogh is so enraged by this that he screams just what he thinks at them, and loses all chance of another path in life.And throughout the film he remains a Christian, but he is too much of a self-absorbed and passionate artist to always retain his ethics.  Douglas' Van Gogh can stick with no situation or person very long: the only constant thread in his life is his passion for painting.  Sometimes the performance is so good we can feel Van Gogh's landmine madness coarsing through the screen and even empathize with those who had to reject him because fiery nature could be really scary at times.We get the chance to see Van Gogh's paintings in a way we never have before, which is probably the best part of this movie.  That and his relationship with his long suffering brother Theo, played superbly by James Donald.  He should have gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor, not Anthony Quinn, who turns in roughly the same performance in every movie and happened to get lucky with this one.  Somewhere inside him he knows his brother is a genius, but he still has the flesh and blood Van Gogh to deal with financially and otherwise.  The ending could not have been remotely as powerful as it is without him.This film, despite concerning a man of titanic imagination, is also a good realistic attack on the myth of the tortured artist as something romantic and to be envied. Barring his moments of vision, Van Gogh's life was a hell of sorts and led him to a miserable death.  This is nothing to envy or emulate and this movie communicates that.  Still, beautifully done and must see for anyone who wants to understand one of the greatest painters to ever live.",5,"""I hope his soul is quieter than mine..""",1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,3195,"['Critics', 'lambasted', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'performance', 'hammy', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'doubt', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'read', 'Letters', 'Theo', 'miraculously', 'brought', 'life.As', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'actual', 'life', 'whole', 'thing', 'kind', 'creaking', 'bipolarity', 'periods', 'creative', 'bliss', 'happiness', 'fulfillment', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'intensity', 'trouble', 'too', 'often', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Paul', 'Gaughan', 'would', 'seem', 'strange', 'fit', 'off', 'pretty', 'well', 'can', 'feel', 'arguments', 'crashing', 'thunderstorms', 'Vincent', 'unwavering', 'belief', 'friendship', 'so', 'innocent', 'enthusiastic', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'heartbroken', 'when', 'so', 'terribly', 'Douglas', 'vividly', 'what', 'suspect', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'reading', 'correspondences', 'paintings', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'visionary', 'ever', 'really', 'make', 'practical', 'world', 'overcome', 'restlessness', 'long', 'enough', 'allow', 'art', 'mature.The', 'beginning', 'film', 'more', 'other', 'sequence', 'how', 'violently', 'alienated', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'was', 'coteries', 'social', 'mores', 'doomed-from-the-start', 'mission', 'be', 'minister', 'ironically', 'was', 'too', 'Christian', 'Christians', 'explosion', 'underground', 'poverty-stricken', 'children', 'very', 'miner', 'who', 'introduced', 'real', 'hellish', 'existence', 'reprimanded', 'spiritual', 'superiors', 'dressing', 'incorrectly', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'so', 'enraged', 'just', 'what', 'chance', 'path', 'life.And', 'film', 'Christian', 'too', 'much', 'self-absorbed', 'passionate', 'artist', 'always', 'retain', 'ethics', 'Douglas', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'can', 'stick', 'situation', 'person', 'very', 'long', 'only', 'constant', 'thread', 'life', 'passion', 'painting', 'Sometimes', 'performance', 'so', 'good', 'can', 'feel', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'landmine', 'madness', 'coarsing', 'screen', 'even', 'empathize', 'who', 'had', 'reject', 'because', 'fiery', 'nature', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'scary', 'times.We', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'paintings', 'way', 'never', 'have', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'relationship', 'long', 'suffering', 'brother', 'Theo', 'played', 'superbly', 'James', 'Donald', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'not', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'who', 'roughly', 'same', 'performance', 'movie', 'happened', 'get', 'lucky', 'one', 'Somewhere', 'brother', 'genius', 'still', 'flesh', 'blood', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'deal', 'financially', 'otherwise', 'ending', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'remotely', 'as', 'powerful', 'him.This', 'film', 'concerning', 'man', 'titanic', 'imagination', 'also', 'good', 'realistic', 'attack', 'myth', 'tortured', 'artist', 'something', 'romantic', 'be', 'envied', 'Barring', 'moments', 'vision', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'life', 'was', 'hell', 'sorts', 'led', 'miserable', 'death', 'nothing', 'envy', 'emulate', 'movie', 'Still', 'beautifully', 'done', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'understand', 'one', 'greatest', 'painters', 'ever', 'live']",Lust for Life VHS

The scenes he plays with Anthony Quinn's Paul Gaugin are so touching, as even Gaugin (a very hard person) must acknowledge how sad Vincent's longing for a friend is.Highlighting the film also are the color depictions of many of Van Gogh's canvases, raw in color and emotion, a testament to a man who didn't know how to do anything by halves, but gave his whole heart and soul to everything he did and everyone he loved, whether reciprocated or not.",4,Tortured Genius,997056000,"08 6, 2001",2001,904,"['would', 'wager', 'really', 'best', 'work', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'ever', 'did', 'spite', 'reputation', 'famous', 'director', 'MGM', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'musicals', 'quot', 'Lust', 'Life', 'quot', 'power', 'pathos', 'seldom', 'matched', 'biographical', 'movies', 'story', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'struggle', 'paint', 'find', 'companionship', 'beautifully', 'brought', 'life', 'here', 'course', 'due', 'superstar', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'intensity', 'tortured', 'artist', 'scenes', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Paul', 'Gaugin', 'are', 'so', 'touching', 'even', 'Gaugin', 'very', 'hard', 'person', 'must', 'acknowledge', 'how', 'sad', 'Vincent', 'longing', 'friend', 'is.Highlighting', 'film', 'also', 'are', 'color', 'depictions', 'many', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'canvases', 'raw', 'color', 'emotion', 'testament', 'man', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'do', 'anything', 'halves', 'gave', 'whole', 'heart', 'soul', 'everything', 'did', 'everyone', 'loved', 'reciprocated', 'not']",Lust for Life VHS

In today's world, Vincent would be put on a regimine of drugs, and lived a life of obscurity. In his day, his only relief from the inner torment was through his painting. It's interesting to note that he was never recognized a great painter until long after he snuffed out his own life. At one time, one of his former landlady's used some of his paintings to cover up holes in her barn, Many of his paintings have been lost forever to time, but the ones remaining are now looked upon as some of the most heart-felt paintings ever done.  With Anthony Quinn portraying Paul Gaugin, the movie unfolds to show a life of highs and lows, of a man tortured by his own mind. Perhaps that's what draws us to Vincent today; each of us can see a part of ourselves in the paintings of a man that few understood. Only now do we recognize the genius of this man.

281898,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,6301971191,magellan,"[1, 2]","Please note that I saw this movie on TV so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer.Van Gogh's troubled life is dramatically brought to the screen in one of Douglas's greatest roles. Douglas and Quinn are superb in this movie as the two ill-fated artist friends, and also James Donald is great as van Gogh's devoted brother. The movie follows van Gogh from his departure from divinity school and his ministerial work with the miners to his ultimate suicide. Van Gogh is shown as a man who is passionate about everything in his life--his religion, his art, and his women--often to the point of being out of control. But that's why van Gogh's story is still well known today, because he lived life on the edge in otherwise conservative, dreary, repressive Victorian society.But although we're supposed to feel sorry for and empathize with the tragic van Gogh, interestingly he doesn't always make a very sympathetic character in this movie. For example, Gauguin praises van Gogh's paintings when no one else would, but in return van Gogh criticizes Gauguin's, setting the stage for another of their blow-ups. And when the woman he loves rejects him he refuses to accept it and tries to force his attentions on her.Unfortunately, the two friends are direct opposites, so their friendship is doomed from the start. Gauguin can be arrogant and abrasive even with his friends, and so the volatile and sensitive van Gogh is soon at odds with his fellow roommate, but they are thrown together by circumstances and by their rejection of the uninspired French Academy art of the day.Rejected by the art society of his day and often neglected even by his friends, fortunately van Gogh knew a few good people who helped him over the years. Pere Tanguy and Dr. Gachet were two of his admirers who were supportive, and of course his brother, who offered encouragement and supported him financially throughout his troubled life. And he is helped initially by his relative Mauve, an artist himself, who gives him materials to work with and some advice on how to proceed. The contrast between the successful and prosperous-looking Mauve's studio and van Gogh's poverty couldn't be more striking.Several times people comment about how van Gogh and Gauguin started late and so the odds are against them just because of  that. Interestingly, van Gogh, who had no formal art training, ended up developing a style that has more in common with the expressionism of forty years later than the Impressionists of his own time, with whom he is usually lumped. Considering how late they started, it's amazing van Gogh and Gauguin accomplished as much as they did.The movie does a fine job of showing many of van Gogh's paintings. I'm assuming museum-quality reproductions were obtained for the filming, but I don't know for sure. I notice that one of the professional reviews says Minelli used an obsolete color process for the movie. I'd like to know more about that and how it affected the color.Overall, a fine movie based on the Irving Stone novel. I'd also like to know what Stone thought of the movie, but I suspect he was pleased with how it turned out.",5,Dramatic depiction of the artist's life,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,3144,"['Please', 'note', 'saw', 'movie', 'TV', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'quality', 'video', 'transfer.Van', 'Gogh', 'troubled', 'life', 'dramatically', 'brought', 'screen', 'one', 'Douglas', 'greatest', 'roles', 'Douglas', 'Quinn', 'are', 'superb', 'movie', 'two', 'ill-fated', 'artist', 'friends', 'also', 'James', 'Donald', 'great', 'van', 'Gogh', 'devoted', 'brother', 'movie', 'van', 'Gogh', 'departure', 'divinity', 'school', 'ministerial', 'work', 'miners', 'ultimate', 'suicide', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'shown', 'man', 'who', 'passionate', 'everything', 'life', 'religion', 'art', 'women', 'often', 'point', 'being', 'control', 'why', 'van', 'Gogh', 'story', 'still', 'well', 'known', 'today', 'lived', 'life', 'edge', 'otherwise', 'conservative', 'dreary', 'repressive', 'Victorian', 'society.But', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'empathize', 'tragic', 'van', 'Gogh', 'interestingly', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'movie', 'example', 'Gauguin', 'van', 'Gogh', 'paintings', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'would', 'return', 'van', 'Gogh', 'Gauguin', 'setting', 'stage', 'blow-ups', 'when', 'woman', 'accept', 'force', 'attentions', 'her.Unfortunately', 'two', 'friends', 'are', 'direct', 'opposites', 'friendship', 'doomed', 'start', 'Gauguin', 'can', 'be', 'arrogant', 'abrasive', 'even', 'friends', 'so', 'volatile', 'sensitive', 'van', 'Gogh', 'soon', 'odds', 'fellow', 'roommate', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'circumstances', 'rejection', 'uninspired', 'French', 'Academy', 'art', 'day.Rejected', 'art', 'society', 'day', 'often', 'neglected', 'even', 'friends', 'fortunately', 'van', 'Gogh', 'knew', 'few', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'helped', 'years', 'Pere', 'Tanguy', 'Dr.', 'Gachet', 'were', 'two', 'admirers', 'who', 'were', 'supportive', 'course', 'brother', 'who', 'offered', 'encouragement', 'supported', 'financially', 'troubled', 'life', 'helped', 'initially', 'relative', 'Mauve', 'artist', 'who', 'materials', 'work', 'advice', 'how', 'proceed', 'contrast', 'successful', 'prosperous-looking', 'Mauve', 'studio', 'van', 'Gogh', 'poverty', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'striking.Several', 'times', 'people', 'comment', 'how', 'van', 'Gogh', 'Gauguin', 'started', 'late', 'so', 'odds', 'are', 'just', 'Interestingly', 'van', 'Gogh', 'who', 'had', 'formal', 'art', 'training', 'ended', 'up', 'developing', 'style', 'more', 'common', 'expressionism', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'Impressionists', 'own', 'time', 'whom', 'usually', 'lumped', 'Considering', 'how', 'late', 'started', 'amazing', 'van', 'Gogh', 'Gauguin', 'accomplished', 'as', 'much', 'did.The', 'movie', 'fine', 'job', 'showing', 'many', 'van', 'Gogh', 'paintings', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'museum-quality', 'reproductions', 'were', 'obtained', 'filming', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'notice', 'one', 'professional', 'reviews', 'Minelli', 'used', 'obsolete', 'color', 'process', 'movie', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'more', 'how', 'affected', 'color.Overall', 'fine', 'movie', 'based', 'Irving', 'Stone', 'novel', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'Stone', 'thought', 'movie', 'suspect', 'was', 'pleased', 'how', 'turned', 'out']",Lust for Life VHS

He is DEFINITELY one of Hollywood's best actors! In ""Lust For Life"", he may very well have done his best work. Of course, he can't be ignored with his portrayal of Spartacus, but there is more accurate historical reference in regards to Vincent Van Gogh. That Van Gogh was mentally ill is irrefutable. It is curious, that civilization still has no place for people with Van Gogh's ""condition"".The see-saw highs and lows that Van Gogh experienced were convincingly portrayed by Douglas. I believe it has everything to do with Kirk Douglas' expressive face. While it may at times, appear as though cut from rock, you can easily see what's going on just by looking at that face!Anthony Quinn, likewise, did a fantastic job portraying Vincent's friend, Gauguin. The period in which these two men lived must have been full of wonder at the natural world, the likes of which we very rarely see today, because we are so preoccupied with ""Modernization"". This wonder is expressed in Van Gogh's paintings. While some may be dismissive of his style, he was savant-like in bringing the richness of what he saw onto canvas. In ""Lust For Life"", we are witness to the demons that plagued Van Gogh for the majority of his life, and ultimately became the engines of his own destruction.It is painful at times, to see a man so at war with himself, yet able to convey a sense of utter calm in his paintings. During the infamous ""ear scene"", it is difficult to watch him succumbing to his demons so fully, that physical pain brings no relief to him.""Lust For Life"", for those who have not seen it yet, is a powerful film on the life of one of history's greatest painters.

Kirk Douglas as Vincent crackles with intensity. He won a Golden Globe award for his portrayal; depicting Van Gogh's artistic growth, deep loneliness and inevitable descent into madness with sensitivity and pathos. It is a moving performance that, along with Spartacus and Paths of Glory, is one of his best. Anthony Quinn as Paul Gauguin won a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. James Donald is especially touching as Vincent's loving Brother Theo. The film features a powerful and poignant musical score by the great film and Classical Music composer Miklos Rozsa, composer of music for Ben-Hur, Double Indemnity, Ivanhoe and The Lost Weekend amongst many others. This film is, along with John Huston's Moulin Rouge made in 1952 about the life of Toulouse-Latrec, one of my favorite Hollywood films about an artist.As soon as the titles appear on this recently released DVD you are aware of the superb transfer to disc. Written with Van Gogh's trademark thick impasto technique, they leap off the screen with 3-dimensional brilliance, breathtakingly alive. This is important because the film contains dozens of Van Gogh's most famous art works, all filmed from the originals in the possession of private collectors and museums. With their thick swirls of color and movement, the images are stunningly beautiful; making the DVD of the film a living art gallery. This was worth the price of the DVD for me. I wish there was some way each one of the paintings could have been bookmarked on the DVD to make them easier to find. Alas no. However, the other more disappointing aspect of this DVD release is that it does not contain the 30 minute long ""Making of"" documentary that often followed the showing of this film on Turner Classic Movies. This fine documentary showed how modern locations in Holland, Belgium and France were painstakingly converted into the late 19th Century locations actually painted by Van Gogh. It also showed how Kirk Douglas developed his characterization. It featured the process by which extras were chosen amongst local townspeople, including one old French woman who had actually known Van Gogh, had seen him paint and remarked upon Douglas' uncanny resemblance to the painter. It is a wonderful little film and its absence from this DVD is inexplicable. There is certainly room for it. The only extras are a 3 minute trailer and a fine commentary by Dr. Drew Casper, a film historian who gives a deeper, more academic analysis of the film than is usual for a commercial release not on Criterion or Kino. This was a missed opportunity by Turner Entertainment that makes no sense and is deeply disappointing.The film is in color shot in widescreen with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 enhanced for widescreen TVs. It looks beautiful, almost 3-dimensionally vivid. It is 122 minutes in length. Sound is offered in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and sounds glorious. Miklos Rozsa's music sounds especially alive. Languages for menus are English and French. Subtitles are in English, French and Spanish. The region code is NTSC 1.This is a film definitely worth getting for its beauty and its excellence. Its lack of appropriate extras is disappointing but that is tempered by gratitude for finally having this wonderful, deeply moving film available on DVD.

I haven't seen the DVD version, but I hope it's considerably better than the print showing on cable.At any rate, it's tremendously well done--the entire look of the production creating the sense of time and authentic atmosphere and actually filmed on the actual location sites with an impressive cast of villagers and supporting actors, including PAMELA BROWN, NIALL MacGINNIS (as The Postman), and most of all, JAMES DONALD as brother Theo, who nurtures his brother and supports him financially but is unable to sell any of his paintings--except one.It's a fine recreation of the Irving Stone novel and Douglas immerses himself in the character of Van Gogh, much the way ANTHONY QUINN does as Gauguin. Quinn's stormy, tempestuous relationship with Douglas provides some electric moments of conflict.The score by Miklos Rozsa accents the drama at every turn, slashing at the drama the way Van Gogh slashed at his canvas with thick brush strokes.

281910,A27M15DFUPV1CK,6301971191,peterfromkanata,"[8, 10]","Released theatrically in 1956, ""Lust for Life"" remains one of the finest films about an artist, in this case the great Dutch painter, Vincent Van Gogh. With his keen eye for colour, Vincente Minnelli was the ideal choice to direct this handsome film for MGM. Based on the best selling novel by Irving Stone, ""Lust for Life"" must have been a real treat to see on the big screen in all its Cinemascope and Metrocolor glory.Vincent Van Gogh was, of course, the quintessential ""tortured soul"", who--after a brief but stormy career as a clergyman--found his true calling as an artist. We follow his life through his relationships with others--an overbearing, intolerant father--a generous, supportive brother (Theo)--a woman who spurns his love with a brutal finality--a poor, single mother, Christine, who for a time, offers him shelter from the ""storms of life""--and, of course, other artists, most notably the volatile Paul Gauguin. While today Vincent's paintings sell for millions of dollars, and he is recognized as a genius, he did not enjoy monetary success in this lifetime. In fact, despite his love of creating art, he still had to battle serious psychological demons.As Van Gogh, Kirk Douglas is brilliant--easily one of the finest performances of his long and distinguished career. Visually, Mr.Douglas is perfect, but he also really seems to inhabit the skin and the mind of Van Gogh. He was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, and justifiably so (he lost to Yul Brynner in ""THe King and I""). As Paul Gauguin, Anthony Quinn did win the best supporting Oscar with a role tailor-made for his ebullient, earthy persona. James Donald is fine as Theo, the long-suffering, ever-faithful brother. Pamela Brown as Christine and Henry Daniell as Vincent's autocratic father are both memorable in smaller roles.Unlike at least one other reviewer, I found the widescreen, colour DVD picture to be gorgeous. The scenes where we see Vincent create some of his famous paintings--for example--""Wheat Field With Crows"" are lovely. Many of his paintings from museums, galleries and private collections are woven into the story, or presented in a stunning collage at the end of the film. The Dolby Surround Stereo is effective for a film of this vintage. Extras are sparse--comments from film historian, Drew Casper, and a trailer.""Lust for Life"" is educational--an exceptionally well-acted drama--and a visual feast.

Marsella,"[0, 0]","Having just read Van Gogh The Life ,an outstanding 900 page biography, of Vincent Van Gogh I was curious to see this film again after many years to see how it lined up against the book. I was very impressed with the film for a number of reasons. It is obviously condensed compared to the book and begins with Vincent already a grown man trying to enter the ministry. The time he spent in Arles with Gaugin takes up a significant part of the film even though their time living and working together was really only three months out of his 37 years. That aside the performances by Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn are both excellent. Douglas particularly does well in conveying the artists manic depressive states and his essential feeling of isolation. The scenery and and the way the film incorporates the actual paintings of Van Gogh and sets them in context is truly remarkable.A film by necessity must have a buildup ,a climax and a conclusion and the choices that were made by Vincente Minelli to achieve that without compromising the essence of Van Gogh's life story result in a wonderful concise view into a very complex artist and troubled man.Overall I thought after reading the book that I might find the film trite but I was happily surprised to find it completely engaging from beginning to end.

As films about artists go, I like this film better than POLLOCK and almost as much as BASQUIAT. This is very much an overlooked CLASSIC. I have friends who are fans of Van Gogh's who have never heard of this film. Based on the book of the same title by Irving Stone and for those who love DEAR THEO: the abridged letters of Vincent Van Gogh, a must see. This film absolutely conveys the heartbreaking feeling of this starving misunderstood genius pounding his lifeblood into canvas in a French atelier or countryside while the gallery owners scoff and the painter remains unrecognized and unloved.Kirk Douglas' finest performance, is fraught with peril. Anthony Quinn, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Paul Gauguin, is superb. The script, some of which was taken from Van Gogh himself, is sometimes dated but always poignant: ""Sometimes the pictures come to me as if in a dream, with a terrible lucidity."" BRILLIANT!!Unfortunately the VHS format is fullscreen which begs the question; WHY IS THIS MASTERPIECE UNAVAILABLE IN WIDESCREEN ON DVD!?!
