The critics ravaged this film when it came out last year, and in truth there are parts of it that are sloppily directed, and don't quite work, but it's really not that bad - fans of Tea Leoni and Jim Carrey will probably enjoy it.Fun with Dick and Jane follows the travails of Dick and Jane Harper. Dick is a well-off executive, a bit jealous of a neighbor's special-order Mercedes but otherwise happily married to his travel agent wife and pleased to be the father of 6-year-old Billy. They're a kind-hearted off-beat and goofy couple, who are proud of their achievements, particularly when Dick ends up being promoted to vice president of communications at the corporate giant Globodyne.While Dick sucks up to the Chief Financial Officer Frank Bascombe (Richard Jenkins) and the company's legendary chief executive, Jack McCallister (Alec Baldwin), Jane decides to quit her job on the strength of Dick's promotion. But his situation is a set-up. He's being made the company fall guy, tapped to announce Globodyne's quarterly projections as the company goes up in smoke. Suddenly he's out of a job and finds it next to impossible to get a new one.Things start to get desperate as Dick and Jane go from shopping for a hot tub to working at the local box store and volunteering for product testing. They eventually end up pulling robberies at convenience stores with their son's squirt gun to make ends meet. It's a quick fall for the couple, to be sure, but the earlier scenes are more amusing than Dick and Jane pulling robberies. Their crime spree lasts about 10 screen minutes, until they decide to swindle Dick's ex-boss.Fun with Dick and Jane makes no apologies about it's send up of the Enron scandal and the film, as a whole, gets a lot of mileage out of being set in our current age of corporate excess. Disgraced executives at places like Enron and Tyco are given prominent ""special thanks"" in the closing credits. But this propensity towards politically correct satire works in fits and starts. The third act is perhaps the strongest with a silly revenge plot that allows Carry and Leoni to exploit their natural rapport and comic timing to great effect.The script is of this movie is the real problem - it isn't nearly as acerbic and biting as it should be and it lacks real sting. Sure, we get send-ups of Ken Lay, George W. Bush and corporate greed, but the lines lack punch. Most of the energy is put into dumb action, generating intermittent laughs.There's no doubt Carrey and Leoni get the physical comedy right and they also convey the required chemistry for a couple that once scheduled dates for sex and now find lawlessness a spontaneous turn-on. But mostly they're asked to flail around in over-the-top ""funny"" acts. While the premise is as timely as ever and the two leads instantly likable, Fun With Dick and Jane just lacks the clout to make it a truly memorable social satire.

I'm giving the movie 4 stars because in a few places this disparity seems a little out of place, but in most cases, it works fairly well. Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni are pretty humorous and convincing as the main characters, and the whole corporate scene is done well, even if it isn't necessarily totally realistic. I would say the only odd thing about the movie is that after robbing numerous banks and other institutions, not only do the main characters not get caught, but they actually end up being heroes.

Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[0, 2]","I'm sorry, Tea Leoni might be beautiful, but she just isn't funny enough to keep up with Jim Carrey, and in my view she really dragged him down in this movie. Not only that, but Jim Carrey just wasn't himself in this; he tried to be too normal and wasn't as slapstick as I had gotten used to him being (until the out-takes). Sure, he had his moments, but they were too brief to really matter. In the end, I classed this movie alongside Truman Show as an attempt at seriousness while also trying to be funny.But it wasn't bad, just not right for the actor. And as a remake, it was actually pretty good and far more modern. The story follows Dick Harper as a high-powered executive placed in a position to fail by the company he works for, and when that failure happens he finds himself without a job. Though he tries to get other jobs, things just don't work out and finally, driven by a severe lack of funds, he and his wife Jane decide a life of crime is the way to go. But still, Dick is bothered by the events at his old job (an Enron like corporation) and finds a way to get back at his old bosses for doing him dirty.As I already said, the movie has its moments, but it takes quite a bit of time before the ""life of crime"" segment begins, and very little in the way of physical comedy comes before that. Be honest, when you hear that Jim Carrey is taking a role, you want to know what he's going to do next, not how well he's going to act in that role (though to be fair, he is a fine actor that probably should have been noticed for Eternal Sunshine). In fact, if not for the DVD special features, especially the outtakes, I may have given this a lesser rating, but the outtakes had me crying with laughter so I have to give it a star for accomplishing that in such a short time.As for recommendations, if you like Jim Carrey a lot, then you'll like Fun With Dick & Jane. But if all you liked from Jim Carrey were movies like the Mask or Ace Venture or Me, Myself, and Irene, then you probably won't feel this movie. Yes, it is very funny at times, but it doesn't feel like a Jim Carrey movie, and the sad thing is he helped produce it.

Dick Harper has lost his job at Globodyne, along with everybody else.  The CEO played by Alec Baldwin came out of the collapse as rich as ever, while his employees lost everything.  Harper, played by Carrey, tries to find a job but refuses to take anything less than a VP position.  Eventually, they sell all their possessions.  When that isn't enough, the resort to robbery.They become quite good at stealing and soon are back to their extravagant level of spending and living.  Hearing he may also be indicted for Globodyne's failure, Harper decides to go after the CEO.  This Christmas blockbuster really isn't that good.  First, it is definitely a satire but it is set just enough in the real world that sometimes the lines blur and the message of the movie becomes a bad one.  Dick and Jane face no consequences for their numerous acts of armed robbery.  The movie portrays it as idealistic that they are stealing to replenish their possessions.

168778,A3JPFWKS83R49V,1404974725,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[0, 2]","""Fun with Dick and Jane"" presents yet another remake of an older movie. This is quickly becoming an old habit, with Hollywood churning out remakes almost as quickly as it creates original motion pictures. It is a trend I cannot see coming to an end anytime soon, given the popularity of these types of films.George Segal and Jane Fonda were the stars in the original- a comedy about a couple who is forced to deal with the runaway inflation and widespread unemployment of the late 1970's. This time around, we have Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni in the starring roles as Dick and Jane and this time, the source of their grief isn't high unemployment and inflation. Updated for the twenty- first century, the problem this time around is an unnecessary layoff stemming from a greedy and corrupt CEO who wants to rob employees of their money.Like the 1977 version of this film, the happy couple is forced to confront a difficult financial situation and they react by turning to a life of crime. Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni work together, driving around town in their old, beat up car, donning masks, and holding up various stores and financial institutions as a means to get money and save their home from foreclosure. They are not alone in their newfound ""profession"". At one point, the mask is pulled from another executive co- worker who is doing exactly the same thing: using armed robbery as a means to make a living.Jim Carrey is good in this type of role because it allows him to showcase him comic talents and add some physical comedy into the mix for added fun. Most of the verbal comedy in the film is supplied by Carrey and every now and then, he delivers with a memorable one- liner. When he isn't saying funny things, he is delivering the fun by way of physical comedy. Some funny physical moments occur when he is holding up a convenience store and cannot get the fake gun to situate itself correctly in his jacket pocket; and when he and his family are trying to position themselves in front of a neighbor's sprinkler so they can bathe (remember- they are broke and looking for any way to save money).Alec Baldwin is pretty good as the bad guy in this movie but Tea Leoni is only average and I can think of several actresses who could have delivered a more convincing performance. Richard Jenkins is pretty good, but the rest of the cast has a very limited role in this film. It mostly centers on Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni, with a small amount of input from Alec Baldwin and Richard Jenkins.The idea of a couple stealing to make ends meet won't sit well with some viewers who feel this is sending a bad message to kids. When this film was released, I can recall some critics stating their disgust with a movie that makes crime look like a feasible means to make a living. Carrey and Leoni have some close calls, but they never get caught committing any of these crimes. Some critics contend that this is sending a message that says ""when times get tough through no fault of your own, the proper way to get even and to survive is by stealing"". I didn't get any message like that. For me, it was just another zany comedy.Speaking of the message, this is one of the important components of this movie. It's a political message and there is no mistaking what direction it is coming from. The problems with Enron, Worldcom, Tyco, and other corporations that have found themselves embroiled in scandal are either mentioned in this movie or shown in the credits at the end for providing inspiration for the film. The movie itself is meant to illustrate this problem in corporate America- the problem of CEO's and other executives who cook the books and end up costing employees more than just their jobs in the end. There are also some obvious political messages about Bush and his former opponent Al Gore, with George W. Bush shown talking on television and several Gore/Lieberman campaign signs appearing in the background in different scenes. The problem with this movie and its message, however, is that the script isn't deep enough or involved enough to take seriously. The viewer knows what is taking place and knows the point the director is trying to get across. But the message would have been stronger and more meaningful with a better script.Overall, this is still a good enough movie to recommend. There are some good, genuinely funny moments and Jim Carrey gets a chance to show off his comedic talents. It isn't another stupid, slapstick comedy- it has a few serious moments as well and these moments help to make it a better comedy. Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni might be cast as temporary criminals, but their characters are likeable and the ending- while basically unreal- is a happy one where the former employees get even with the boss man, thanks to the actions of Jim Carrey and Richard Jenkins.",3,Movie Remake With a Updated Political Twist,1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,4806,"['Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'yet', 'remake', 'older',

It's nice to see Jim Carrey in a more serious (not space-alien level whacky) role.  There are some funny moments, I won't spoil them for you here.However there are a few levels that this film does not work on...1. Enron/Worldcom is too old to be relevant.  I found myself saying, ""oh, yeah, I remember that"".  The attempt to tie the comedy to that exact event dates it, and the events themselves don't lend to the comedy.  It's like making a comedy about a plague.  It would have been better to ditch the ""Enron/Worldcom"" stuff for more generic ""economic downturn"" themes.  That's what makes the original 1977 movie (and others, like ""Gung-Ho"") better.2. The caper in the end of the film is too hard to follow, and doesn't really resolve itself in a credible way.  In fact, the 'villain' is actually made a hero in the end.I broke down and bought the 1977 movie DVD after seeing this, and enjoyed it a lot more.  George Segal (Jack Gallo from ""Just Shoot Me"") and Jane Fonda (political weirdo) do a great job.  Even Ed McMahon was fun to watch as the nasty snake of a boss.If I had to buy one version of this film, I'd pick the 1977 one.

They play a suburban couple, Dick and Jane Harper, who fall from the penthouse to the outhouse. Dick is promoted to vice president for communications at Globodyne, a promotion so big that Jane quits her job. That same afternoon he realizes that he is merely a talking head for corporate sleaze bags. When Globodyne craters, they lose everything, as do all the employees. They resort to criminal capers to survive, and in the end exact recompense from the corrupt executives and restore the lost fortunes of the former Globodyne employees. In a delicious dig, when the credits roll you read a list of people honored for ""Special Thanks,"" then realize that the names are real life corporate criminals--Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, Dennis Kozlowski, and so on.

Fortunately Carrey brings his A Game to FUN WITH DICK AND JANE, a dark, satirical, yet highly satisfying remake of the Seventies classic of the same name.  This time Carrey and Tea Leoni make up the couple Dick and Jane Harper; Dick is in charge of corporate communications of a company about to tank, while Jane is unhappy as a travel agent longing to be a stay-at-home mom.  Because Dick has been energetically sunshine pumped by his two bosses (a deadpan Alec Baldwin and an hysterical Richard Jenkins), he urges his wife to quit her job, and Jane is more than happy to accommodate.  Of course once this occurs the stock in Dick's corporation goes down the john; because Dick and Jane's nest egg is worthless stock, they immediately feel the effects of being destitute.  Desperate, frustrated, and furious, they embark on a life of crime--then plot to get the ultimate revenge from those who have wronged them.  Their journey will have you rolling on the floor.  (Just wait 'til you see their Sonny and Cher disguise.)Again, Carrey is hilarious here, as the silly story allows him to effectively employ his brand of physical comedy, yet (surprisingly) Leoni more than holds her own; this versatile actress should do more comedies.  The dire straits Dick and Jane face lend to the overall zaniness of the film (for example, in one scene Dick, Jane, and their young son run through a neighbor's sprinkler to wash themselves and brush their teeth for the day); and the sight of Jenkins sipping on his pint while he drunkenly instructs Dick and Jane how to steal stock certificates still has me grinning.  To be sure FUN WITH DICK AND JANE is predictable and often contrived--but it's still one darn fine comedy.--D.

Dick works for a large corporation (Globodyne), and once he is promoted to Vice President of Communications, Jane quits her job as a travel agent, as she feels horrible that she can't cook dinner and her son is being raised by their nanny and speaks nearly only Spanish.  However, all this runs amuck on Dick's first day in his new position as he goes on a Lou Dobbs/Neal Cavuto-type show, and the company tanks under the leadership of a crooked CEO (Alec Baldwin with a rather annoying Southern accent, but I tend to find most fake Southern accents annoying).As Dick and Jane start to lose their picture-perfect lifestyle, I just kept thinking about how simiar this plot line was to the collapse of Enron (which was intentional, even though this is a remake), and I kept thinking about the people who actually have gone through this kind of collapse.  This kind of empathy makes you really like Dick and Jane, and it's not even that bothersome that they become rather bungling-yet-successful robbers.  You still find yourselves rooting for them.  In the end, the crooked CEO gets his just desserts, and Dick and Jane come out as silent heros.At 90 minutes, this movie definitely doesn't drag.  It's just a fun, quick movie.

Some of the scenes with him trying to figure out how to rob were hilarious and his acting in this one seemed to help a movie with a plot about as ludicrous as imaginable.This flick is definitely in the popcorn category of entertainment. You can't take anything in it too seriously or believable, but it can be fun at times. Still, like some others have alluded to (or plainly said), there are times when the plot seems a little forced, like they are hoping for a laugh desparately. Alec Baldwin's character is a little too paper thin to even give any credibility to. But, for what its worth, this is a comedy that doesn't resort to an overabundance of profanity, potty humor, over crudeness to make it go, and this is a plus.

In this film version, they even have a dog, Spot - see Spot stop barking (in quite an interesting manner, and yes, I sat through the film to make sure that no animals were harmed).  This updated version of the 1977 original film adds elements of the modern American corporate world to the basic storyline, which still works nearly a generation later.  In the credits, inspirational credit is given to Enron, Worldcom and a host of other corporations whose financial outcomes did not live up to the fullness of the American dream.Dick is a mid-level executive with a multinational corporation.  His wife Jane is a travel agent, who seems to only attract the customers from hell.  When Dick gets the promotion to senior executive, vice-presidential level, Jane sees the opportunity to let her job sail away, and becomes a full-time housewife.  Meanwhile, Dick's company does a dot-com bubble burst fast enough to generate a sonic boom, leaving both Dick and Jane without a job in a corporate town where suddenly everyone is unemployed.The furniture, the car, even the lawn gets sold or repossessed, as Dick and Jane variously look for ways to make ends meet with odd jobs and gray-market tactics.  Finally, Dick has had enough.  He decides to rob a convenience store.  After a few abortive attempts, he finally succeeds in a small score, and both the cash and the excitement propel both Dick and Jane into further and further escapades.  However, this is small-time items, and when another couple from the same corporation is caught doing the same thing as Dick and Jane, the couple decide that it is time to retire, but not before making one last retirement heist.Enter here the twist - in the original film, Dick knew of a safe upstairs in the corporate office that held lots of undocumented cash.  In the modern version, Dick discovers a sort of modern equivalent, that being off-shore accounts.  Can Dick and Jane find a way to take the loot?The ending here is in some ways predictable, but has a very interesting twist which shows both a generosity of spirit and a justice-will-be-done aspect that is truly well done.  Would that the same could be done for the real-life corporations mentioned in the end!Jim Carrey and Tea Leone make a great comedic duo in this film; Alec Baldwin plays the not-quite-as-stupid-as-he-seems corporate leader with good flair.  The slip from success to unemployment to armed robbery is not seen as shocking, but somehow natural and understandable in the modern world (which is in and of itself a frightening idea).Nothing deep or profound, and the script is servicable if not brilliant, but there is fun indeed with this film.",4,Having a little fun...,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,2932,"['recall', 'seeing', 'original', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'plot', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'adhered', 'interesting', 'twist', 'finale.The', 'names', 'course', 'are', 'play', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'series', 'children', 'books', 'film', 'version', 'even', 'have', 'dog', 'Spot', 'see', 'Spot', 'stop', 'barking', 'quite', 'interesting', 'manner', 'yes', 'sat', 'film', 'make', 'sure', 'animals', 'were', 'harmed', 'updated', 'version', '1977', 'original', 'film', 'elements', 'modern', 'American', 'corporate', 'world', 'basic', 'storyline', 'still', 'nearly', 'generation', 'later', 'credits', 'inspirational', 'credit', 'given', 'Enron', 'Worldcom', 'host', 'other', 'corporations', 'financial', 'outcomes', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'fullness', 'American', 'dream.Dick', 'mid-level', 'executive', 'multinational', 'corporation', 'wife', 'Jane', 'travel', 'agent', 'who', 'only', 'attract', 'customers', 'hell', 'When', 'Dick', 'promotion', 'senior', 'executive', 'vice-presidential', 'level', 'Jane', 'opportunity', 'let', 'job', 'sail', 'away', 'full-time', 'housewife', 'Meanwhile', 'Dick', 'company', 'dot-com', 'bubble', 'burst', 'fast', 'enough', 'generate', 'sonic', 'boom', 'leaving', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'job', 'corporate', 'town', 'where', 'suddenly', 'everyone', 'unemployed.The', 'furniture', 'car', 'even', 'lawn', 'sold', 'repossessed', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'variously', 'look', 'ways', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'odd', 'jobs', 'gray-market', 'tactics', 'Finally', 'Dick', 'had', 'enough', 'rob', 'convenience', 'store', 'few', 'abortive', 'attempts', 'finally', 'small', 'score', 'cash', 'excitement', 'propel', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'further', 'further', 'escapades', 'However', 'small-time', 'items', 'when', 'couple', 'same', 'corporation', 'caught', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'couple', 'decide', 'time', 'retire', 'not', 'making', 'one', 'last', 'retirement', 'heist.Enter', 'here', 'twist', 'original', 'film', 'Dick', 'knew', 'safe', 'upstairs', 'corporate', 'office', 'held', 'lots', 'undocumented', 'cash', 'modern', 'version', 'Dick', 'sort', 'modern', 'equivalent', 'being', 'off-shore', 'accounts', 'Can', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'find', 'way', 'take', 'loot', 'ending', 'here', 'ways', 'predictable', 'very', 'interesting', 'twist', 'generosity', 'spirit', 'justice-will-be-done', 'aspect', 'truly', 'well', 'done', 'Would', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'real-life', 'corporations', 'mentioned', 'end', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Tea', 'Leone', 'make', 'great', 'comedic', 'duo', 'film', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'not-quite-as-stupid-as-he-seems', 'corporate', 'leader', 'good', 'flair', 'slip', 'success', 'unemployment', 'armed', 'robbery', 'not', 'seen', 'shocking', 'somehow', 'natural', 'understandable', 'modern', 'world', 'frightening', 'idea', '.Nothing', 'deep', 'profound', 'script', 'servicable', 'not', 'brilliant', 'fun', 'indeed', 'film']",N/A

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 5]","Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni play Dick and Jane Harper, an upwardly mobile, happily married couple enjoying their slice of American pie. Both have job fulfillment and live in the upper-middle class tax bracket. Both are so fixated on work that they have neglected their young son Billy, who prefers to speak Spanish, thanks to the Mexican maid, who has mostly reared him.Dick works for Globodyne Corporation and gets promoted to VP of Communications (but only so he could play scapegoat when the corporate stocks plummet). Globodyne goes under, Dick loses his job. At the same time, Jane quits her position in the travel agency. Their lifestyle takes a downhill turn (""We're in a bit of a pickle, Dick"") - the lawn is repossesed; they have to frequent all-you-can-eat restaurants and pile food a foot high on the plate; they sell their tv (the kid piteously cries out ""Don't take my Telemundo!"") They manage to eke by for a while by taking on menial, minimum-wage gigs: Jane sells her body for science experiments and becomes a jeet kune do instructor; Dick works at KostMart and hires on as a day laborer (but gets deported to Mexico). Out of desperation, Dick resorts to robbery, initially abetted by a bemused Jane, who doesn't take long to get with the program. The film goes on to depict the Harpers' criminal hijinks while garbed in various disguises (my favorite is the Sonny & Cher costumes). The final 20 minutes or so reveals how Dick and Jane get even with the dastardly CEO of Globodyne.This comedy is a remake of the great 1977 Fun With Dick & Jane, which starred George Segal, Jane Fonda and Ed McMahon (!). This update is just as hilarious and, what's more, is more relevant and topical today. Globodyne Corporation is obviously patterned after Enron, in its nefarious misdealings and amoral disregard and treatment of its employees and stockholders. The film also pokes fun at the dog-eat-dog world of competitive employment and satirizes the lengths people would go to to attain a career foothold. Yeah, it's over the top but remember, this is a Jim Carrey starrer.Jim Carrey does tone it down enough here (not much, but enough) that you get more involved with his character. But, as usual, when he does go for the laughs, he'll crack you up with his amazing rubber face and elastic frame. It's also not surprising that Tea Leoni acquits herself well. She is an accomplished comedic actress, beautiful and wry, but smoothly meshing with Carrey in the crazy moments. They should really do more films together. Alec Baldwin, on the other hand, has got that sleazy corporate persona down cold.  Aaron Michael Drozin as the Harpers' son Billy provided me with some of my biggest guffaws; the kid is good.The special features were a letdown. The gag reel was subpar for a Carrey film. The filmmakers' audio commentary left me cold - for some reason, these guys thought they were stand-up comedians and just rambled away with incessantly unfunny oneliners, seemingly not even caring enough to stay on point with the onscreen scenes - *infuriating*. I do give a thumbs-up to the publicity outtakes; once again, these promo bits prove the Carrey-Leoni comedic onscreen chemistry is real. All in all, I give it a well-deserved four stars.

This witless film's one redeeming value is its brevity, and even with that, its 90 minutes feel longer than King Kong.  It is a movie whose idea of comedy includes playing the plight of Hispanic day laborers and border crossers for yucks.  Jim Carrey has never been less funny than in his antic portrayal of Dick Harper.  It is a major career backward step from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  As for Tea Leoni, following on her work in Spanglish, she is now the leading candidate for a Lifetime Achievement Award in the Suburban Shrew Category.  The movie would have you believe they are middle-class heroes.  But when thrown out of his job by the slash and burn pilferage of his company's CEO (a suitably smug Alec Baldwin), Harper proves that the only difference between himself and the CEO is creative opportunity as he quickly falls to robbing the rich (and poor) to give to --  himself.  In fact, this whole movie uncannily parallels the behavior of the fictional (and as is made clear by the closing credits) real life CEO's it purportedly satirizes and criticizes -- it is nothing more than a shoddy, sleazy attempt to enrich itself at public expense.In case I haven't been clear enough -- watch a movie by Ed Wood before you watch this one.",1,Don't Waste Your Time and Money,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,1345,"['Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'wish', 'again', 'Amazon', 'scale', 'permitted', 'zero', 'stars', 'witless', 'film', 'one', 'redeeming', 'value', 'brevity', 'even', '90', 'minutes', 'feel', 'longer', 'King', 'Kong', 'movie', 'idea', 'comedy', 'playing', 'plight', 'Hispanic', 'day', 'laborers', 'border', 'crossers', 'yucks', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'never', 'been', 'less', 'funny', 'antic', 'portrayal', 'Dick', 'Harper', 'major', 'career', 'backward', 'step', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'following', 'work', 'Spanglish', 'now', 'leading', 'candidate', 'Lifetime', 'Achievement', 'Award', 'Suburban', 'Shrew', 'Category', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'are', 'middle-class', 'heroes', 'when', 'thrown', 'job', 'slash', 'burn', 'pilferage', 'company', 'CEO', 'suitably', 'smug', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Harper', 'only', 'difference', 'CEO', 'creative', 'opportunity', 'quickly', 'robbing', 'rich', 'poor', 'give', 'fact', 'whole', 'movie', 'uncannily', 'behavior', 'fictional', 'as', 'made', 'clear', 'closing', 'credits', 'real', 'life', 'CEO', 'purportedly', 'nothing', 'more', 'shoddy', 'sleazy', 'attempt', 'enrich', 'public', 'expense.In', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'clear', 'enough', 'watch', 'movie', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'watch', 'one']",N/A

We watch in disbelief as more and more CEOs are hauled up to jail and how these unscrupulous people leave their once valued employees to fend for themselves, as best they can.I didn't find myself laughing as much as I wanted to from this film. 2005 was the year dominated by comedy-remake stinkers like the ""Honeymooners,"" and ""Bewitched,"" Dick and Jane was one of the better films of that year to watch. Jim Carrey does it very well on this film with this Slapstick comedy but not the pie throwing variety, it's a lot more subtle than the ""Ace Ventura"" movies but it's no dark comedy either.Carrey's excited, over-the-top performance works here and made me laugh, but the writing tattered some of his performance. He didn't do enough to work over the bad writing, however. Tea Leoni always makes me chuckle and there was no difference here. She gave a performance that evened out Carrey's, making the couple seem a little less annoying than it could have been. Alec Baldwin is despicable in a role that oozes cruelty and manipulation. The fact that he pulled it off actually frightens me a bit. Richard Jenkins plays his part off the crazy way, going over-the-top all the time. I still haven't decided whether or not it worked, which, I guess, it a compliment and a negative comment all at the same time.""Fun with Dick and Jane"" works some of the time thanks mostly to its likable and talented cast. Unfortunately, the writing is weak and the laughs are little. Many of the scenes that were meant to give the audience huge belly laughs were more annoying than funny. The film also takes too long getting to its principle premise and, when the premise does start to surface, it is too short and feels rushed. ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" is just another factory-produced, by-the-book comedy that never tries to be anything more. It never proves to be anything more than a cardboard cut-out, nor does it attempt to. Most of the jokes are just not funny and the cast is wasted on recycled, cliched, and predictable material. Unlike ""The Family Stone"" that took an old formula that still worked and gave the formula a fresh spin, ""Fun"" takes a formula that just doesn't work anymore and doesn't do anything to improve it.

Stillman ""Movie Man""","[0, 1]","With the barrage of film remakes hitting the screen lately, it was almost inevitable that the 1977 classic ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" would also get a cinematic facelift.  The original film with George Segal and Jane Fonda is one of my all-time favorites, and I was looking forward to seeing this new version to see how it could be updated.Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni are very funny in the lead roles, and there are some hilarious and inspired scenes, such as when Dick is mistaken for an illegal immigrant and deported, and when Jane has an allergic reaction to skin chemicals she is using.But even with all the fun this new movie has to offer, I couldn't help longing for the original version.  While the updated ""Dick and Jane"" uses slapstick to get laughs, the original film simply uses situations themselves to draw out the comedy.  For instance, I really missed the ""deadbeat"" scene from the 1977 film, when contractors enter the Harpers' home to remove unpaid-for plants while Dick is entertaining a potential new boss.Also, the new ""Dick and Jane"" seems to fall flat at the point when the Harpers decide to turn to crime.  The stick-up scenes are weak and unimaginative and don't illicit much humor.  Richard Jenkins' drunk CFO character is more irritating and pathetic than funny.  Not since ""Arthur"" has a drunk in a movie made me laugh.Finally, the ending of this film lacks comedic punch, and it seemed obvious to me that it was set in the year 2000 at the beginning just to be able to have the last joke about Enron.Summing up, I didn't like Jim Carrey's film as much as the 1977 movie, but there are enough laughs in it to make it worth a look.",3,Who Ever Said Crime Doesn't Pay?,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,1653,"['barrage', 'film', 'remakes', 'hitting', 'screen', 'lately', 'was', 'almost', 'inevitable', '1977', 'classic', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'would', 'also', 'get', 'cinematic', 'facelift', 'original', 'film', 'George', 'Segal', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'new', 'version', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'updated.Jim', 'Carrey', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'lead', 'roles', 'are', 'hilarious', 'inspired', 'scenes', 'such', 'when', 'Dick', 'mistaken', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'deported', 'when', 'Jane', 'allergic', 'reaction', 'skin', 'chemicals', 'using.But', 'even', 'fun', 'new', 'movie', 'offer', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'longing', 'original', 'version', 'updated', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'slapstick', 'get', 'laughs', 'original', 'film', 'simply', 'situations', 'draw', 'out', 'comedy', 'instance', 'really', 'missed', 'deadbeat', 'scene', '1977', 'film', 'when', 'contractors', 'enter', 'Harpers', 'home', 'remove', 'unpaid-for', 'plants', 'Dick', 'entertaining', 'potential', 'new', 'boss.Also', 'new', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'fall', 'flat', 'point', 'when', 'Harpers', 'decide', 'turn', 'crime', 'stick-up', 'scenes', 'are', 'weak', 'unimaginative', 'do', ""n't"", 'illicit', 'much', 'humor', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'drunk', 'CFO', 'character', 'more', 'irritating', 'pathetic', 'funny', 'Not', 'Arthur', 'drunk', 'movie', 'made', 'laugh.Finally', 'ending', 'film', 'comedic', 'punch', 'seemed', 'obvious', 'was', 'set', 'year', '2000', 'beginning', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'last', 'joke', 'Enron.Summing', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'film', 'as', 'much', '1977', 'movie', 'are', 'enough', 'laughs', 'make', 'look']",N/A

How far would you go to ensure that your family is taken care of financially?  Would you be willing to steal for the money?  Sell your body to science?  Dress up like Sonny and Cher?  Well, not everyone would be willing to go to those lengths, especially the latter, but that's how far Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni are willing to go in the hit comedy remake of ""Fun with Dick and Jane"".""Fun with Dick and Jane"" gives us a glimpse into the happy life of Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni), a loving, middle class couple whose lives are turned upside down when Dick is terminated as Globodyne Corporation's VP of Communications after being set up by his boss (Alec Baldwin).  After months of searching for new work Dick and Jane are at the end of their ropes; virtually everything they own has been repossessed, including their lawn, and both have tried to make money on the sides by having Jane sell her body to science and Dick working as a day laborer only to find himself temporarily deported to Mexico.  Feeling increasingly desperate, this once happy couple turn to their last resort, stealing money from the rich and giving to the poor... basically themselves.I really wanted to see this movie when it was initially released to theaters, but reviews from critics and average movie audiences weren't always so kind towards it.  Thus leading me to doubt whether I wanted to pay the expensive cost of tickets to see what could possibly be just another comedy where all the funny parts are in the previews.  So, I waited until its arrival on DVD, and upon renting and watching this movie I discovered that not only did I find the movie to be very funny, downright hilarious in some spots, but it also had a large amount of drama and heart as the characters dealt with a lagging income due to their current circumstances.  I was really impressed by Jim Carrey in this movie, because he generally has a tendency to go over-the-top with most of his characters, but for this movie he stayed pretty even, and I thought that for the subject matter of a couple being down on their luck being such a highly relatable topic for many people, he played the role respectfully to those in that position.  Tea Leoni did a wonderful job as the loving housewife whose watching her dream house and life being stripped away from her, and feels helpless to stop it from happening, but in all the insanity still providing the loving support her husband needs, even in some of the not-so-legal money making endeavors.The story for ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" contained a very serious undertone, covered by comedy without being too nonchalant about the subject matter.  The writers along with the director did a very good job of walking that fine line between being too serious and making a drama out of the movie and isolating Jim Carrey's core audience, while not being too light and comedic to make those that are in that position or have been feel as if they are being made light of.  So, kudos to the creative team behind the film to find the proper balance to deliver a very solid comedy with the right amount of drama to make the whole movie believable and enjoyable to watch.""Fun with Dick and Jane"" is rated PG-13 for language.",4,Don't Mess With Dick and Jane...,1178064000,"05 2, 2007",2007,3328,"['were', 'lose', 'job', 'due', 'evil', 'machinations', 'boss', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'get', 'payback', 'How', 'far', 'would', 'go', 'ensure', 'family', 'taken', 'care', 'financially', 'Would', 'be', 'willing', 'steal', 'money', 'Sell', 'body', 'science', 'Dress', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'Well', 'not', 'everyone', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'go', 'lengths', 'especially', 'latter', 'how', 'far', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'hit', 'comedy', 'remake', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'glimpse', 'happy', 'life', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'Harper', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'loving', 'middle', 'class', 'couple', 'lives', 'are', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'Dick', 'terminated', 'Globodyne', 'Corporation', 'VP', 'Communications', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'boss', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'months', 'searching', 'new', 'work', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'are', 'end', 'ropes', 'virtually', 'everything', 'own', 'been', 'repossessed', 'including', 'lawn', 'have', 'tried', 'make', 'money', 'sides', 'having', 'Jane', 'sell', 'body', 'science', 'Dick', 'working', 'day', 'only', 'find', 'temporarily', 'deported', 'Mexico', 'Feeling', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'once', 'happy', 'couple', 'turn', 'last', 'resort', 'stealing', 'money', 'rich', 'giving', 'poor', 'basically', 'themselves.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'initially', 'released', 'theaters', 'critics', 'average', 'movie', 'audiences', 'were', ""n't"", 'always', 'so', 'kind', 'Thus', 'leading', 'doubt', 'wanted', 'pay', 'expensive', 'cost', 'tickets', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'just', 'comedy', 'where', 'funny', 'parts', 'are', 'previews', 'So', 'waited', 'arrival', 'DVD', 'renting', 'watching', 'movie', 'discovered', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'spots', 'also', 'had', 'large', 'amount', 'drama', 'heart', 'characters', 'dealt', 'lagging', 'income', 'due', 'current', 'circumstances', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'movie', 'generally', 'tendency', 'go', 'over-the-top', 'most', 'characters', 'movie', 'stayed', 'pretty', 'even', 'thought', 'subject', 'matter', 'couple', 'being', 'down', 'luck', 'being', 'such', 'highly', 'relatable', 'topic', 'many', 'people', 'played', 'role', 'respectfully', 'position', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'loving', 'housewife', 'watching', 'dream', 'house', 'life', 'being', 'stripped', 'away', 'feels', 'helpless', 'stop', 'happening', 'insanity', 'still', 'providing', 'loving', 'support', 'husband', 'needs', 'even', 'not-so-legal', 'money', 'making', 'endeavors.The', 'story', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'contained', 'very', 'serious', 'undertone', 'covered', 'comedy', 'being', 'too', 'nonchalant', 'subject', 'matter', 'writers', 'director', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'walking', 'fine', 'line', 'being', 'too', 'serious', 'making', 'drama', 'movie', 'isolating', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'core', 'audience', 'not', 'being', 'too', 'light', 'comedic', 'make', 'are', 'position', 'have', 'been', 'feel', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'light', 'So', 'kudos', 'creative', 'team', 'film', 'find', 'proper', 'balance', 'deliver', 'very', 'solid', 'comedy', 'right', 'amount', 'drama', 'make', 'whole', 'movie', 'believable', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'language']",N/A

The movie revolves around the title characters and their fun filled life. They both have high paying jobs, when the amazing happens: Dick gets promoted as the new VP Chairman of a big business. Because of the new promotion, Jane quits her job, Dick orders some new things for the house, and life is just perfect. Unfortunately, it turns out Dick was promoted to be a scapegoat for the corporation, and Dick is thrown on TV to explain to the world why the CEO (played by Alac Baldwin) has just cashed in on all the stock he owned, and why the company has gone bankrupt.Dick has no answers, and suffers all this humiliation just to wind up without a job. A few months later, both Dick and Jane can't find work, and they are reduced to crime to make themselves money so they can live. Strangely enough, this is where the movie takes a dive. Instead of being like Robin Hood and taking from the rich and greedy, they steel from the poor and good people who work hard to make an honest buck. Kind of hard to root for the main characters when they are robbing an old-timer who runs a gift shop store. I won't deny that ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" isn't funny.This movie does contained some laughs, and there are even a couple scenes that are gut-splitting funny. However these moments aren't frequent enough, and most of the laughs are mere chuckles then genuine laughs. This also isn't Jim Carrey's best work to date either. Considering he made this movie after making the very intriguing (and strange) ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" this movie seems like going back to the basics for him. Tea Leoni is also annoying, playing the same hyperactive mom she's played in the last five or seven films she's made.Dick and Jane eventually do make an effort to get even with the evil CEO who put them (and other families) in misery, but by then it feels like too little too late. By now we've gotten the message that corporations are evil, and we don't like Dick and Jane very much at this point. This movie tries to make a point that people with money are evil and selfish people, but then the movie contradicts itself by saying the same thing about poor people who live an honest life.

168835,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,1404974725,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Let me start out by saying that the idea of remaking ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" actually seemed like a good idea to me. The original was a pleasant romp, but not a classic, so an updating might be in order. I was even cautiously optimistic when Jim Carrey was cast. And then I started to hope, maybe this will finally be Tea Leoni's breakthrough. This had hit written all over it.Sadly, not so much success...First, let me plug Leoni, an actress with great comic sensibilities who keeps getting stranded in substandard fare. Dramatically, she has been in insufferable and contrived films like HOUSE OF D and SPANGLISH. She has also appeared in mediocre comedies like THE FAMILY MAN and this. And she's done the action thing in the tepid JURASSIC PARK 3, the laughably inane BAD BOYS and DEEP IMPACT (not necessarily a great movie, but at least she retained her dignity). Only FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, a terrific comedy by David O. Russell, used her to full affect.Jim Carrey, I'll say right now, is a talented performer. But he's also his own worst enemy. He needs a director who can restrain him and actually make him turn in a performance. Here, he's bellowing to the rafters and screwing up his hammy face in hyperdrive. Well, I've seen this before, ALL TOO OFTEN. There's no real character here, it's just Carrey doing the Carrey shtick that we're all supposed to love so much.As for the plot, it's all a bit silly. After losing their jobs, Leoni and Carrey can't get work anywhere doing anything! Even though they are seasoned, successful professionals, Carrey can't even hold down a job as a store greeter. So, naturally they turn to a life of crime. With a total lack of concern for anything ethical. They rip off individuals, neighborhood stores, corporate entities. All for a laugh. Heck, we wouldn't want them to lose the hot tub or big screen TV or maid!Cast as good guys, they are playing the villains. There is no justification for their actions, they never question anything or display integrity. They are not REAL CHARACTERS anymore, they are bodies standing inside this picture so the script can play out to its prolonged, preachy conclusion. Jim, I beg you, your popularity is waning. Choose to be an actor, you've got it in you.

Carrey's company is a thinly-veiled clone of Enron, whose plummeting financial fortunes result in Carrey's premature departure from the workplace, and from there the hijinks begin. Ironically, the movie, which was made after the 2001 Dot.com debacle and bear market, in a way presaged the far more wide-reaching financial disasters of today.Having fallen from a wealthy VP to collecting unemployment checks, all too soon the couple finds they can't afford their new lawn, expensive yuppie cars, their upscale home, and the pool boy. Oddly enough, they keep their housekeeper almost to the very end. Some of the most trenchant scenes occur when Carrey tries to find other employment and finds that apparently every other desperate executive in town is competing for the same position.Carrey brings a zanier, more hyper interpretation to the male lead, with his eye-popping facial expressions and frenzied, over-the-top performances. But then I expect that of Carrey. Leoni's is less over the top performance and is more like Fonda's in the original.The movie changes many of the original scenes; for example, it doesn't reprise the funny scene in which Segal and Fonda rob the phone company and people are thanking and blessing them, which I missed. But since the breakup of Ma Bell perhaps that wouldn't have played as well. But the movie still has many funny scenes of its own. In one hilarious scene, Carrey finds that both he and one of his former executive colleagues are trying to rob the same bank. :-)Eventually, after seeing the hopelessness of trying to find a real job with so many other executives out of work, the couple turns to crime, where they progress from bumbling tyros to competent stick-up artists. After hatching a scheme to get back at the corrupt president of the company who looted its assets (played by Alec Baldwin), Carrey saves the employees' retirements and all is well at the conclusion of the movie. I have a nostalgia for the original but this movie is just as funny and clever as the first one, and it's probably a must see for Carrey fans.",4,Good remake,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,2235,"['Warning', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'only', 'couple', '.I', 'saw', 'original', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'George', 'Segal', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'so', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'remake', 'would', 'compare', 'Carrey', 'company', 'thinly-veiled', 'clone', 'Enron', 'plummeting', 'financial', 'fortunes', 'result', 'Carrey', 'premature', 'departure', 'workplace', 'hijinks', 'begin', 'Ironically', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '2001', 'Dot.com', 'debacle', 'bear', 'market', 'way', 'presaged', 'far', 'more', 'wide-reaching', 'financial', 'disasters', 'today.Having', 'fallen', 'wealthy', 'VP', 'collecting', 'unemployment', 'checks', 'too', 'soon', 'couple', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'new', 'lawn', 'expensive', 'yuppie', 'cars', 'upscale', 'home', 'pool', 'boy', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'keep', 'housekeeper', 'almost', 'very', 'end', 'most', 'trenchant', 'scenes', 'occur', 'when', 'Carrey', 'find', 'other', 'employment', 'apparently', 'other', 'desperate', 'executive', 'town', 'competing', 'same', 'position.Carrey', 'zanier', 'more', 'hyper', 'interpretation', 'male', 'lead', 'eye-popping', 'facial', 'expressions', 'frenzied', 'over-the-top', 'performances', 'then', 'expect', 'Carrey', 'Leoni', 'less', 'top', 'performance', 'more', 'Fonda', 'original.The', 'movie', 'changes', 'many', 'original', 'scenes', 'example', ""n't"", 'reprise', 'funny', 'scene', 'Segal', 'Fonda', 'rob', 'phone', 'company', 'people', 'are', 'thanking', 'blessing', 'missed', 'breakup', 'Ma', 'Bell', 'perhaps', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'played', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'still', 'many', 'funny', 'scenes', 'own', 'one', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'Carrey', 'one', 'former', 'executive', 'colleagues', 'are', 'trying', 'rob', 'same', 'bank', 'Eventually', 'seeing', 'hopelessness', 'trying', 'find', 'real', 'job', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'executives', 'work', 'couple', 'crime', 'where', 'progress', 'bumbling', 'tyros', 'competent', 'stick-up', 'artists', 'hatching', 'scheme', 'get', 'back', 'corrupt', 'president', 'company', 'who', 'looted', 'assets', 'played', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Carrey', 'employees', 'retirements', 'well', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'have', 'nostalgia', 'original', 'movie', 'just', 'funny', 'clever', 'first', 'one', 'probably', 'must', 'see', 'Carrey', 'fans']",N/A

She works at a travel agency to support their middle class lifestyle.Together, the Harpers have a new house in the suburbs, a son named Billy, a dog named Spot (of course), and a servant named Blanca.In 2000, Dick's big promotion finally comes. He's now the VP of Communications for his company. He encourages Jane to quit her job to stay home with Billy, an idea she loves.On his first day in his new position, he goes on a cable outlet to counter the bad news in the media about his company. While he announces to the world that everything is fine, the FCC announces a full-scale investigation and stock prices plummets.Dick's initial reaction is to not worry. After all, they've got savings. Certainly he can get a new job in a couple months. But as the months go by, nothing happens. All of Dick's former co-workers are also trying to get the limited number of jobs in the area. Dick's desperate attempts to get any kind of job only lead to failure. Finally, out of desperation, Dick and Jane turn to crime. But when they have a chance to get revenge on Dick's former boss (Alec Baldwin), can they pull it off?I was interested in seeing this movie for one reason and one reason alone - they filmed a scene about half a mile from my house. I'm not a Jim Carrey fan, so I was expecting to hate the movie. Plus I didn't like the sounds of the plot. When I got a chance to attend a test screening the end of October, I jumped. I figured this was a way to see the movie without wasting money. I enjoyed every minute of it.In spite of how the plot sounds, this really is a comedy. Maybe because I don't think that way, I've never been able to understand how a black comedy works. All I know is, this one does. The humor seems to come from the absurd. What is happening on the screen is so absurd it really is funny. The scene shown in the trailer where they are asking if the muffins are low fat before taking them is a perfect example. Even while the comedy is coming from absurdity, it is grounded in reality. The likelihood of these events happening to these people is slim to none, but you believe it could happen when watching the movie.Of course, being a Jim Carrey movie, there is physical comedy as well. The scene of him racing other applicants to a job interview comes to mind. He does an amazing job in one scene being a puppet with invisible strings.A big thing that helps the movie is the characters. They truly are likable. Even when they start breaking the law, you can't help but root for them to win. Mr. Carrey and Ms. Leoni deserve lots of credit for bring these characters to life with such skill.Also, as I've hinted at before, the story holds together well. The writers take time making the situations believable. Because of that, the story takes time getting where we know the movie is going, but you truly need that time to understand why Dick and Jane turn to a life of crime.Not that the movie drags at all. It starts out strong and keeps moving from one funny situation to another until the ending, which I absolutely loved.I have recently found out this movie is a remake of a 1977 movie with the same title and plot starring George Segal and Jane Fonda in the title rolls. Since I haven't seen that movie, I can't compare the two. What I can tell you is this movie seemed fresh and funny to me.Since what I saw was a test screening, things can change. Frankly, I don't see how they can make the movie any better. Based on what I saw, this is a winner and I will certainly pay money to see it again.",5,See Dick and Jane,1134086400,"12 9, 2005",2005,3660,"['Meet', 'Dick', 'Harper', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'employee', 'mega', 'corporation', 'way', 'corporate', 'ladder.Meet', 'Jane', 'Harper', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'travel', 'agency', 'support', 'middle', 'class', 'lifestyle.Together', 'Harpers', 'have', 'new', 'house', 'suburbs', 'son', 'named', 'Billy', 'dog', 'named', 'Spot', 'course', 'servant', 'named', 'Blanca.In', '2000', 'Dick', 'big', 'promotion', 'finally', 'now', 'VP', 'Communications', 'company', 'Jane', 'quit', 'job', 'stay', 'home', 'Billy', 'idea', 'loves.On', 'first', 'day', 'new', 'position', 'cable', 'outlet', 'counter', 'bad', 'news', 'media', 'company', 'world', 'everything', 'fine', 'FCC', 'full-scale', 'investigation', 'stock', 'prices', 'plummets.Dick', 'initial', 'reaction', 'not', 'worry', ""'ve"", 'got', 'savings', 'Certainly', 'can', 'get', 'new', 'job', 'couple', 'months', 'months', 'go', 'nothing', 'happens', 'Dick', 'former', 'co-workers', 'are', 'also', 'trying', 'get', 'limited', 'number', 'jobs', 'area', 'Dick', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'get', 'kind', 'job', 'only', 'lead', 'failure', 'Finally', 'desperation', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'turn', 'crime', 'when', 'have', 'chance', 'get', 'revenge', 'Dick', 'former', 'boss', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'movie', 'one', 'reason', 'one', 'reason', 'alone', 'filmed', 'scene', 'mile', 'house', ""'m"", 'not', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fan', 'was', 'expecting', 'hate', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'sounds', 'plot', 'When', 'got', 'chance', 'attend', 'test', 'screening', 'end', 'October', 'jumped', 'figured', 'was', 'way', 'see', 'movie', 'wasting', 'money', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'it.In', 'spite', 'how', 'plot', 'really', 'comedy', 'Maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'way', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'able', 'understand', 'how', 'black', 'comedy', 'works', 'know', 'one', 'humor', 'come', 'absurd', 'What', 'happening', 'screen', 'so', 'absurd', 'really', 'funny', 'scene', 'shown', 'trailer', 'where', 'are', 'asking', 'muffins', 'are', 'low', 'fat', 'taking', 'perfect', 'example', 'Even', 'comedy', 'coming', 'absurdity', 'grounded', 'reality', 'likelihood', 'events', 'happening', 'people', 'slim', 'none', 'believe', 'could', 'happen', 'when', 'watching', 'movie.Of', 'course', 'being', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'movie', 'physical', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'racing', 'other', 'applicants', 'job', 'interview', 'mind', 'amazing', 'job', 'one', 'scene', 'being', 'puppet', 'invisible', 'strings.A', 'big', 'thing', 'movie', 'characters', 'truly', 'are', 'likable', 'Even', 'when', 'start', 'breaking', 'law', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'win', 'Mr.', 'Carrey', 'Ms.', 'Leoni', 'deserve', 'lots', 'credit', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'such', 'skill.Also', ""'ve"", 'hinted', 'before', 'story', 'together', 'well', 'writers', 'take', 'time', 'making', 'situations', 'believable', 'story', 'time', 'getting', 'where', 'know', 'movie', 'going', 'truly', 'need', 'time', 'understand', 'why', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'turn', 'life', 'crime.Not', 'movie', 'out', 'strong', 'keeps', 'moving', 'one', 'funny', 'situation', 'ending', 'absolutely', 'loved.I', 'have', 'recently', 'found', 'out', 'movie', 'remake', '1977', 'movie', 'same', 'title', 'plot', 'starring', 'George', 'Segal', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'title', 'rolls', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'What', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'seemed', 'fresh', 'funny', 'me.Since', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'test', 'screening', 'things', 'can', 'change', 'Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'better', 'Based', 'what', 'saw', 'winner', 'will', 'certainly', 'pay', 'money', 'see', 'again']",N/A

Once he looses he job he finds out that his wife, Jane (Tea Leoni) has quite her job and now that are slowly sinking into bankruptcy.

Ive only seen her in serious roles like ""Deep Impact"" and ""Jurrasic Park 3"" and she was great, but i also think she did good in this move, of course she probably isn't as funny as Carrey, but that because hes a comedian...so lay of her.

I think Fun With Dick & Jan has a little of that as well as Tea Leoni's strange deadpan humor, but there was something a little less funny about the movie than you would have expected.  Taking the angle of the Enron corporate maiming, Dick loses his job when his company's CEO screws everyone and lets Globodyne tank, while taking millions with him safely away.  Everyone is devastated.  Jane had quit her job at Dick's insistence that he was getting promoted.  Now they're totally f*cked.  This is the angle that makes the film a little less funny and a lot more depressing that it should be.  The subject matter is hardly hilarious.  Dick & Jane turn to a life of crime to stay above the waterline.  Hell, Dick even steals a front yard after they come and repossess his lawn.  There are parts of genuine hilarity here and there but over all, there is an air of desperation here that should not be funny at all.  Middle of the road entertainment.

Soon strapped for cash, Dick and his wife Jane embark on a crime spree, growing bolder and bolder as their heists get more and more daring.

The plot was good (especially the reference in the film's final lines) and the jokes were never overdone as seems to be Carrey's style so often.  My favorite was the deportation scene, along with the phone call.  Speaking of which, the child actor in the film, Aaron Michael Drozin, was pretty good and his Spanish speaking skills, though I'm no expert, seemed to be even better.

Zwick,"[3, 6]","About the only memories I retain of the original ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" (which I saw when it was released in 1977) are the grass-reclamation scene and Jane Fonda sitting on the toilet doing her business while she and hubby George Segal discussed what next to do with their lives.  Well, I'm here to report that, while the sod-recalling scene managed to find its way into the remake, the chat on the can did not.  Under normal circumstances, I would hail that as a triumph for shrewd editorial judgment and good taste, but in this case at least, a bit of cheap potty humor might have gone a long way towards elevating the comic level of this current film.Dick and Jane Harper are an upwardly mobile couple who fall on hard times when Jane quits her job and Dick loses his when the company he works for goes under due to a corporate scandal.  After trying to make ends meet as best they can, but being thwarted at every turn, Dick and Jane decide to turn to a life of crime, holding up convenience stores and coffee shops like a modern day version of Bonnie and Clyde.  Eventually, however, they realize that they are aiming too low in their targets, so decide it's time to turn the tables on the CEO (Alec Baldwin) responsible for their woes and come up with an elaborate plan to hit the Big Boy of Business where it will do the most good.What with the Ken Lay/Enron scandal still fresh in our minds, the time would certainly seem ripe for some bright satirist to take on the subject of greedy CEOs and general corporate malfeasance as fodder for ridicule.  But ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" is certainly not that movie.  Instead of finely-honed wit and sophistication, the screenplay (credited to no fewer than FIVE writers!) gives us inane slapstick routines that cater to the lowest common denominator audience imaginable.  Perhaps, if this hadn't been fashioned to be a starring vehicle for Jim Carrey, the film might have been able to provide more in the way of humor than some cheap mugging and endless mindless pratfalls.  Carrey has rarely been more annoying than he is here, and even the normally appealing Tea Leoni is at a loss as to how to make this hopeless material work.  In short, this is a dreadful, drearily unfunny travesty that makes the original ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" look like ""Dr. Strangelove"" in comparison.I never thought I`d miss that toilet scene so much.",1,as dumbed down as the characters in the title,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2381,"['only', 'memories', 'retain', 'original', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1977', 'are', 'grass-reclamation', 'scene', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'sitting', 'toilet', 'doing', 'business', 'hubby', 'George', 'Segal', 'discussed', 'what', 'next', 'do', 'lives', 'Well', ""'m"", 'here', 'report', 'sod-recalling', 'scene', 'managed', 'find', 'way', 'remake', 'chat', 'can', 'did', 'not', 'normal', 'circumstances', 'would', 'hail', 'triumph', 'shrewd', 'editorial', 'judgment', 'good', 'taste', 'case', 'least', 'bit', 'cheap', 'potty', 'humor', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way', 'elevating', 'comic', 'level', 'current', 'film.Dick', 'Jane', 'Harper', 'are', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'couple', 'who', 'fall', 'hard', 'times', 'when', 'Jane', 'job', 'Dick', 'when', 'company', 'due', 'corporate', 'scandal', 'trying', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'can', 'being', 'thwarted', 'turn', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'decide', 'turn', 'life', 'crime', 'holding', 'up', 'convenience', 'stores', 'coffee', 'shops', 'modern', 'day', 'version', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Eventually', 'however', 'realize', 'are', 'aiming', 'too', 'low', 'targets', 'so', 'time', 'turn', 'tables', 'CEO', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'responsible', 'woes', 'come', 'up', 'elaborate', 'plan', 'hit', 'Big', 'Boy', 'Business', 'where', 'will', 'do', 'most', 'Ken', 'Lay/Enron', 'scandal', 'still', 'fresh', 'minds', 'time', 'would', 'certainly', 'seem', 'ripe', 'bright', 'satirist', 'take', 'subject', 'greedy', 'CEOs', 'general', 'corporate', 'malfeasance', 'fodder', 'ridicule', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'certainly', 'not', 'movie', 'Instead', 'finely-honed', 'wit', 'sophistication', 'screenplay', 'credited', 'fewer', 'FIVE', 'writers', 'inane', 'slapstick', 'routines', 'cater', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'audience', 'imaginable', 'Perhaps', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'fashioned', 'be', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'provide', 'more', 'way', 'humor', 'cheap', 'mugging', 'endless', 'mindless', 'pratfalls', 'Carrey', 'rarely', 'been', 'more', 'annoying', 'here', 'even', 'normally', 'appealing', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'loss', 'how', 'make', 'hopeless', 'material', 'work', 'short', 'dreadful', 'drearily', 'unfunny', 'travesty', 'original', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'look', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'comparison.I', 'never', 'thought', 'd', 'miss', 'scene', 'so', 'much']",N/A

""Fun With Dick And Jane"" is, ahem, a satire about corporate greed and leaving beyond one's means that clocks in at just a shade longer than an hour and has Jim Carrey brush the dust off whatever goofy ad-lib he can remember from his ""Ace Ventura"" days to mix it with a few scenes of his eyes welling with tears, while Tea Leoni pads her acting resume as a professional screecher.Dick Harper (Carrey) works as a public relations rep for Globodyne, some giant conglomerate about to be raided and ruined by its own CEO, Jack McCalister (Alec Baldwin) and flunky Oz (Richard Jenkins), both of whom hire Dick to humiliate himself on television - and thus become the fall guy - at the very moment the company melts down. Globodyne dissolves the very day Jane quits her job at the travel agency. The couple's stuck in a new house with a new Mercedes, and when the severance runs out, and the savings, too, they turn to robbing banks, first incompetently, then with the skill of criminal masterminds.Director Dean Parisot (""Galaxy Quest"") can't settle on a tone of black comedy or slapstick, and Carrey, who can do either, sure has to because Leoni's no help at all. ""Fun With Dick And Jane"" clips along to an ending that gets the old CEO real good but seems to have been plucked from a Rolodex of sketchy subplots.

And sure, it can help to be a Jim Carrey fan to really get the most kicks out of this film, and I'm not a Jim Carrey fan and I still liked this flick. My 12-year old told me that he wants this film on DVD when it comes out.The interesting thing is the thematic of this film and the situation in which Dick (Jim Carrey) and Jane Harper (Tea Leoni) find themselves which in quite a few cases in recent history isn't that unrealistic. High-level and mid-level executive lost their jobs in the last several years as their bright shining companies went belly up because of corporate fraud or whatever. And these folks had a hard time finding a new job while the bills continued to come in ... for the mortgage, the lease for the beamer, etc. -- their lifestyle which was a bit excessive had to be radically changed immediately. It's actually a very realistic scenario for folks like that and it reminds you that there isn't any job security no matter where you at on the corporate ladder.Anyway, this is supposed to be a comedy and it is, but the underlying tone and theme of this film is very serious. And how Dick and Jane try to solve the problem when the money really runs out and the final foreclosure notice from the bank arrives, is also interesting and not recommended as an example to follow. Jim Carrey does his usual goofs and these are getting a little old, meaning we've seen that before and this and that is no longer as hilarious as it once was. But there are still a number of lines, etc. that will make everyone laugh. The problem again with recent comedies, especially remakes is that the jokes and pointers are often predictable and it takes away from the potential hearty laughs. As a comparison I can still watch ""Dumb and Dumber"" several times a year and I still get a kick out of it every time I watch, which may not be the case with this ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" flick.Still, it's a funny movie for a Saturday afternoon and some relaxing popcorn crunching.

While many would say that his strength is in cartoonish comedy such as the ""Ace Ventura"" films or ""Liar Liar,"" I have also enjoyed some of his dramatic work, as in ""The Truman Show"" and ""Man on the Moon.""  Here he is back to cartoonish goodness as Dick, a working suburban father who longs for more success.  He is transitioning into a huge promotion to vice-president at his Enron-ish company when the company, headed by a selfish and dastardly CEO (Alec Baldwin), collapses.  This would be less catastrophic, had he not convinced his wife, Jane (Tea Leoni) to quit her job as a travel agent.  They try to make ends meet, but after several months, and the loss of many things, such as their BMW and their lawn, desperation starts to settle in.  Robbery, and apparently hilarity, ensue.Dick and Jane enevr achieves comic perfection, but there are some nice moments.  Viewers might be surprised at how funny Tea Leoni can be, especially in tandem with Carrey, who tends to steal the spotlight on a regular basis.  Both have their nice moments, no doubt thanks to Judd Apatow, one of the screenwriters.  Apatow is also responsible for writing and directing The 40 Year Old Virgin.  This one is ok for a bargain matinee, but a definite renter, especially compared to much of the lame comedy that has been produced in the last year.

The film is produced by Brian Grazer (which may tell you much about the content of the film) and Carrey is also one of the producers. The director is Dean Parisot, whose CV includes hilarious `Galaxy Quest' and muddled `Home Fries.'My impression about Jim Carrey's `Fun with Dick and Jane' exactly is right between these two - `hilarious' and `muddled.' I mean, sometimes the film is funny, but the script looks muddled from the beginning to the end. The opening of the film introduces us to the married couple Dick and Jane, Dick has been recently promoted to VP of one big company `Globadyne' while Jane has been working as travel agent. But after the promotion of his husband, she thinks she can devote more time to their only son.But when they think their life is perfect, Dick's company goes bankrupt, and while the CEO (Alec Baldwin) still can afford to live a comfortable life, the employees including Dick are left behind without money. Now being out of job, Dick and Jane try to make money while keeping appearance. After many slapstick gags about how they manage to make ends meet, the couple decide on the revenge plan, to steal money from the CEO himself.[SOCAIL SATIRE AND SLAPSTICKS] One surprise is the chemistry between Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni, which is credible and works better than the various silly jokes. Even when they are desperate to commit robbery, they manage to be likable, and that is no easy feat. It is true that Jim Carrey repeats his schtick works again, but it is also true that he is careful not to rely too much on his usual mugging face and overacting.However, the new `Fun with Dick and Jane' sometimes looks muddled. Dick and Jane do heists, disguised as pop culture icons like The Blues Brothers and Sonny and Cher (and Jim playing the role of Cher ... oh dear), and perhaps these sight gags should be left in the cutting room. More regrettable is the lack of edge when the film deals with the social satire, whose target includes such companies as Enron (the film is set in 2000). Alec Baldwin's CEO is nothing but caricature (and he reminds us of one US president when he goes hunting ... you can guess who it is easily), but the satire is too obvious. Dean Parisot, it seems, does not know how to put things together when he has good and reliable actors like Baldwin and Richard Jenkins beside Jim Carrey's character who is getting crazier and crazier while he was down on his luck.The film is really a mixed bag. It contains two likable characters, some funny moments, a disappointing conclusion, and no insightful comments on the society that should be the target of the film.

They try all sorts of things to earn some dough, from working with illegals to doing medical experiments, but the money is not enough.  See Dick go insane and attempt to rob some stores.  See Dick and Jane steal.  Dick and Jane become great thieves, but the true test comes when they are presented with the opportunity to get back at the boss that caused Dick's company to go bankrupt.The original FUN WITH DICK AND JANE is one of those rare films from the 1970s that has aged rather well and doesn't come off being all that dated.  With all the corporate scandals of the early 2000s, it was reasonable to update FUN WITH DICK AND JANE.  I watched the movie because my brother had seen it and recommended it to me as a decent comedy.  Tea Leoni is an incredibly talented and beautiful actress and I'm willing to watch anything she performs in.  I also enjoy watching Jim Carrey's movies: he's a brilliant physical comedy, but the man can act and act well, too.  They seem like a real couple in the film and the chemistry between the two helps keep things together.  Carrey doesn't get an opportunity to do much of the over-the-top comedy that he is known for, but he has a lot of moments to shine and Leoni holds her own.I am not a fan of Alec Baldwin, but since he was playing the villain of the movie, Jack McCallister; aka the man who bankrupted Globodyne, I was able to bear his presence on screen.The movie moves at a fairly quick pace, though there are a few moments when the plot bogs down in comical scenes that are also meant to be social commentary.  The overall objective of the movie is to get throw a fist in the air at all the executives who make billions of dollars why bankrupted the very people in their companies who are working for them, ala Ken Lay of Enron.  I can handle that.  However, when the movie veers into scenes of social commentary, such as when Dick gets sent to Mexico because someone stole his wallet, I had a difficult time with some of them.  Sure they can be funny, but they also through the timing and focus of the movie off.That's about the only complaint I have about FUN WITH DICK AND JANE.

This one pleasantly surprised me with many unexpected funny scenes.Alec Baldwin always does a great job at portraying someone you want to hate, and does so again as the greedy, corporate top executive who makes it rich at the expense of the average guy.I didn't like the portrayal of turning to robbery and justifying it in desperate circumstances as being a reasonable and fun option.  Their characters were very shallow and vain when in the down and outs, but I guess this movie's intent wasn't to show character in the first place.I guess overall I'd rate it as so-so.

Also, the supporting players including Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins, and Richard Burgis are just so wasted in low-key roles.

As with Cable Guy and other Jim Carrey movies, the critics love to tear him apart, regardless of the film.Fun With Dick and Jane is actually a good film. It's not amazing or anything. It's no classic. Well, it's a remake of a classic I guess. Or maybe the original was just a good movie too. I don't know. I've never seen it. But I can definitely see why the timing was right for a remake.With the corporate scandals that are going on this movie is extremely relevant. Fun With Dick and Jane focuses on the Harper family (Dick, Jane, and son Billy). Dick gets a promotion to VP of Communication at Globodyne, just before the business tanks for its fraudulent accounting practices. Sound familiar?  What follows is funny, although it feels as if it was thrown together a bit haphazardly. Dick and Jane resort to robbery in order to make enough money to support their middle-class lifestyle. This part of the movie almost amounts to a montage as you see Tea Leoni and Jim Carrey, in various costumes, performing various robberies.The comedy is there (You would hope so with Judd Apatow being one of the writers, and Jim Carrey producing and starring), though at times it does seem a bit forced, and the plot a bit rushed. Overall it's a worthwhile movie, and though it's not worthy of huge praise, it definitely doesn't deserve all the criticism it received.The DVD extras are pretty good. There's a blooper reel, which obviously has some great Jim Carrey outtakes. There's also some clips from an interview with Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni that's pretty funny.",4,Much better than critics would have you believe,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,1671,"['huge', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fan', 'was', 'hesitant', 'see', 'movie', 'criticism', 'got', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'other', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'movies', 'critics', 'love', 'tear', 'apart', 'regardless', 'film.Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'actually', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'amazing', 'anything', 'classic', 'Well', 'remake', 'classic', 'guess', 'maybe', 'original', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'movie', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'why', 'timing', 'was', 'right', 'remake.With', 'corporate', 'scandals', 'are', 'going', 'movie', 'extremely', 'relevant', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'focuses', 'Harper', 'family', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'son', 'Billy', 'Dick', 'promotion', 'VP', 'Communication', 'Globodyne', 'just', 'business', 'tanks', 'fraudulent', 'accounting', 'practices', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'What', 'funny', 'was', 'thrown', 'together', 'bit', 'haphazardly', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'resort', 'robbery', 'order', 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'support', 'middle-class', 'lifestyle', 'part', 'movie', 'almost', 'amounts', 'montage', 'see', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'various', 'costumes', 'performing', 'various', 'robberies.The', 'comedy', 'there', 'would', 'hope', 'so', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'being', 'one', 'writers', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'producing', 'starring', 'though', 'times', 'seem', 'bit', 'forced', 'plot', 'bit', 'rushed', 'Overall', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'not', 'worthy', 'huge', 'praise', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'criticism', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'blooper', 'reel', 'obviously', 'great', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'outtakes', 'also', 'clips', 'interview', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'pretty', 'funny']",N/A
