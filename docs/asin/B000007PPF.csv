495021,A1U2IMZ2HM6ABF,B000007PPF,De witte leeuw.,"[0, 0]","Lee Marvin fans will enjoy this early work in his acting career.  Brandon de Wilde was about seventeen when he made this film.  Unfortunately, he died in a car accident when he was only thirty.  The film has an almost Disney-like feel to it, which is why I think it is a good family film.  Lee Marvin plays the part of one of the town's most important residents as the largest land-owner in the area.  The story takes place about 1910 and small-town America is evident right down to the Fourth of July celebration on Main Street.  Marvin plays the part of one of the surliest, most arrogant, and obnoxious characters he has ever played.  Enter Brandon de Wilde, a run away orphan from a nearby institution.  The editor of the town's newspaper and Marvin immediately take on the roll of surrogate parents to him.  And in time the entire town is taken by the boy's innocence.  Every detail of a 1910 midwestern town has been perfectly reproduced from an electric car to the Civil War monument and cannon in the town square.  The period clothing and interior details are convincingly authentic.  De Wilde's chilli-eating scene is priceless.  And if you should watch this film late at night and fall asleep (not because you're bored); not to worry, the DVD will play continuously until stopped.  This film is an authentic little slice of American life in the past with a very happy ending.",5,A Feel Good Movie For the Entire Family.,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1385,"['Lee', 'Marvin', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'early', 'work', 'acting', 'career', 'Brandon', 'Wilde', 'was', 'about', 'seventeen', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'thirty', 'film', 'almost', 'Disney-like', 'feel', 'why', 'think', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'part', 'one', 'town', 'most', 'important', 'residents', 'largest', 'land-owner', 'area', 'story', 'place', '1910', 'small-town', 'America', 'evident', 'right', 'down', 'Fourth', 'July', 'celebration', 'Main', 'Street', 'Marvin', 'part', 'one', 'surliest', 'most', 'arrogant', 'obnoxious', 'characters', 'ever', 'played', 'Enter', 'Brandon', 'de', 'Wilde', 'run', 'away', 'orphan', 'nearby', 'institution', 'editor', 'town', 'newspaper', 'Marvin', 'immediately', 'take', 'roll', 'surrogate', 'parents', 'time', 'entire', 'town', 'taken', 'boy', 'innocence', 'detail', '1910', 'midwestern', 'town', 'been', 'perfectly', 'reproduced', 'electric', 'car', 'Civil', 'War', 'monument', 'cannon', 'town', 'square', 'period', 'clothing', 'interior', 'details', 'are', 'convincingly', 'authentic', 'De', 'Wilde', 'chilli-eating', 'scene', 'priceless', 'should', 'watch', 'film', 'late', 'night', 'fall', 'asleep', 'not', ""'re"", 'bored', 'not', 'worry', 'DVD', 'will', 'play', 'continuously', 'stopped', 'film', 'authentic', 'little', 'slice', 'American', 'life', 'past', 'very', 'happy', 'ending']",N/A

495026,A42QN9MM6LKKM,B000007PPF,Lee in S.F.,"[2, 3]","This 1910-setting family movie tells a simple story with wholesome values, and as such is quite characteristic of the era in which it was made.  It reminded me of the style and demeanor of the Lassie TV series.  The setting is said to be Missouri, but to me it looked more like western terrain, especially with the sharply pointed hilltop in the horse training scene.A significant portion of the movie was filmed outdoors, which also was  characteristic of the era.  As such, this style of movie-making celebrates  nature and its bounty (while also avoiding expensive set pieces!).Lee Marvin was in top form, and I enjoyed his performance thoroughly.  As for some of the supporting players, on occasion, they delivered their lines flatly, or sometimes lapsed into unnecessary pauses during dialog exchanges. On those occasions, I was reminded of high school theatre productions. Yet, in the early days of movie making, the stage was the model for film productions, and so perhaps what I'm noting here was an effect of the stage to film learning curve.The boy (the ""traveler"") is portrayed as quiet and non-expressive, and so, initially, I wished he were more animated.  As the movie progressed, however, he grew on me.  I eventually concluded that a turn of the century rural lad seeking a better life on his own, could very well be flat of expression and guarded with his words.  Likely, my earlier expectations had been influenced by modern child actors, who tend to be portrayed as precocious beyond their years.  Happily, this movie didn't exploit the boy by making him appear to be something that he wasn't in an effort to sell more tickets.I didn't always agree with how the director moderated the scenes.  For example, to me, the race could have been much longer, thus generating more tension before the outcome.  Conversely, the fight scene could have been much shorter, but at least it resolved a lot of earlier plot tensions.  The length of the parade seemed pointless.  (Perhaps for the audience of that era, it wasn't.)  The orator gag seemed ludicrous (clearly a gag, but not a funny one), and hence, it distracted from an otherwise realistic portrayal of small town life.As for the little bit of romance in this film, it blossomed free of a build-up to it--similar to other films of that era.  For example, in Audrey Hepburn films of that era, Hepburn could easily meet Cary Grant one day, and by the next, be telling him that she loved him (which always seemed like such a leap!).  I won't give away the romance in this film, except to say that the basis for it is equally unfounded.The story line was interesting (not cliched), and it evolved well, including a satisfying ending.  Audience members accustomed to impression overload may find the pace of the film to be rather slow, but that's not a discredit to the movie. (One simply needs to pace oneself to it.)  All in all, the movie delivered good entertainment.  I was happy to be left with the story's underlying theme: that we all need one another, and that ""community"" means agreeing to help and be helped.",3,Similar Tone & Style to Lassie series,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,3080,"['1910-setting', 'family', 'movie', 'simple', 'story', 'wholesome', 'values', 'such', 'quite', 'characteristic', 'era', 'was', 'made', 'reminded', 'style', 'demeanor', 'Lassie', 'TV', 'series', 'setting', 'said', 'be', 'Missouri', 'looked', 'more', 'western', 'terrain', 'especially', 'sharply', 'pointed', 'hilltop', 'horse', 'training', 'scene.A', 'significant', 'portion', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'outdoors', 'also', 'was', 'characteristic', 'era', 'such', 'style', 'movie-making', 'celebrates', 'nature', 'bounty', 'also', 'avoiding', 'expensive', 'set', 'pieces', '.Lee', 'Marvin', 'was', 'top', 'form', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'thoroughly', 'supporting', 'players', 'occasion', 'delivered', 'lines', 'flatly', 'sometimes', 'lapsed', 'unnecessary', 'pauses', 'dialog', 'exchanges', 'occasions', 'was', 'reminded', 'high', 'school', 'theatre', 'productions', 'early', 'days', 'movie', 'making', 'stage', 'was', 'model', 'film', 'productions', 'so', 'perhaps', 'what', ""'m"", 'noting', 'here', 'was', 'effect', 'stage', 'film', 'learning', 'curve.The', 'boy', 'traveler', 'portrayed', 'quiet', 'non-expressive', 'so', 'initially', 'wished', 'were', 'more', 'animated', 'movie', 'progressed', 'however', 'grew', 'eventually', 'concluded', 'turn', 'century', 'rural', 'lad', 'seeking', 'better', 'life', 'own', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'flat', 'expression', 'guarded', 'words', 'Likely', 'earlier', 'expectations', 'had', 'been', 'influenced', 'modern', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'tend', 'be', 'portrayed', 'precocious', 'years', 'Happily', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'exploit', 'boy', 'making', 'appear', 'be', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'effort', 'sell', 'more', 'tickets.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'agree', 'how', 'director', 'moderated', 'scenes', 'example', 'race', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'longer', 'thus', 'generating', 'more', 'tension', 'outcome', 'Conversely', 'fight', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'shorter', 'least', 'resolved', 'lot', 'earlier', 'plot', 'tensions', 'length', 'parade', 'seemed', 'pointless', 'Perhaps', 'audience', 'era', 'was', ""n't"", 'orator', 'gag', 'seemed', 'ludicrous', 'clearly', 'gag', 'not', 'funny', 'one', 'hence', 'distracted', 'otherwise', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'small', 'town', 'life.As', 'little', 'bit', 'romance', 'film', 'blossomed', 'free', 'build-up', 'similar', 'other', 'films', 'era', 'example', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'films', 'era', 'Hepburn', 'could', 'easily', 'meet', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'one', 'day', 'next', 'be', 'telling', 'loved', 'always', 'seemed', 'leap', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'romance', 'film', 'say', 'basis', 'equally', 'unfounded.The', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'interesting', 'not', 'cliched', 'evolved', 'well', 'including', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'Audience', 'members', 'accustomed', 'impression', 'overload', 'may', 'find', 'pace', 'film', 'be', 'rather', 'slow', 'not', 'discredit', 'movie', 'One', 'simply', 'pace', 'movie', 'delivered', 'good', 'entertainment', 'was', 'happy', 'be', 'left', 'story', 'underlying', 'theme', 'need', 'one', 'community', 'agreeing', 'help', 'be', 'helped']",N/A

They were of course, very involved with the famous Saratoga Racetrack (just celebrated our 150 yrs in 2013) and she and her husband have done so much for charity over the years.  Mary Lou was an actress when she first met Sonny (was previously married into the John Deere family).  They were a great match and she made him a family and got him out socially and involved in so many things he would never have done.  After Sonny passed, she eventually married John Hendrikson and they have continued to do much for the backstretch workers at the track.

LINDUP,"[3, 3]","Bairn Turner (Brandon deWilde) is a teenager on the run from an orphanage when he is picked up by gruff, arrogant Tobias Brown (a type-cast role for Lee Marvin) who exploits the lads naievete. Local newspaper man Doyle Magee (nicely played by Gary Merrill) sticks up for the boys misdemeanours and encourages his interest in farming and horse-training. Much of the plot has to do with the antagonism between Magee and Doyle and which one Turner  chooses as a role-model.
