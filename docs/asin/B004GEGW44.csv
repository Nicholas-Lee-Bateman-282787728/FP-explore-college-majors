1406795,A3C54XWT93R2WY,B004GEGW44,"Been around this block, several times over","[0, 0]","THIS REVIEW WILL MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE IF YOU&#8217;VE JUST SEEN THE MOVIE (a Warburgian view)!!!Just saw the movie in streaming video, and now I&#8217;m buying copies for myself and loved ones.  As I suggest in the title to this review, it was the way the movie unfolded like a gentle sarabande, introducing layers and dimensions of life and experience with a most mature casualness.  I could see how some might not like it, for the Granny character was played in such a fashion as to render a very classical feel to the whole process.  Her role was pivotal, and they could hardly have chosen a better person to play it.  The role of the boy did not really come alive until he started to interact with her.We got a promise that this movie would be something else&#8212;a story that would keep to its meter throughout&#8212;by the conversation at the start of the film between the boy and the grounds keeper who came to pick him up at the train station.  You just knew that he was a child with crushed hope, his insistence that his father was still alive notwithstanding.  The man was not cautious or unfeeling in his reactions, just emotionally generous in the way he kept making room for the boy and his feelings (as was the housekeeper).  When the boy reacted to the issue of his father with claims that the loved parent was only &#8220;MISSING in action,&#8221; that was the one spot where the rhythm of the tale was dramatically broken&#8212;which told you right there and then that Death was waiting to make its announcement somewhere down the line, if not just around the corner.The plot evolves along a cautionary path, reminding us to attend studiously to what is around us HERE-AND-NOW, not to deny or over-react to the realities in which we live like fish deep in the ocean.  Fish have to swallow that sea water as-is and extract whatever life-giving oxygen there might be in it, letting the polluting bad stuff hopefully pass out through and out of their gills and rear ends.  So it is that we must take in the depth of our ongoing experience in which we inexorably exist&#8212;not fight it with denials, but absorb it so that it might feed as best as it can what is most good within us.  We can only be ourselves, and we can only live the life we&#8217;ve got, the movie seems to be pointing out (lightly at first, initially only here and there).At he start the boy demonstrates such acceptance of experience, even when his experience presents itself to him as a ghostly presence; an attitude that eventually (at the end) allows him even to take in the fact of his father&#8217;s passing.  It seems everyone knew how that matter would end up from the start . . . except him!  His insistence on blocking that reality (which was all along very much a part of his experience) made him harshly mean and cross: in those exceptional moments when he would not relate to what his experience was telling him, the boy found himself in those moment of non-acceptance acting much in the way the Captain&#8217;s despicable son tended to behave nearly ALL the time, and (unlike the boy) around ALL things.  In other words around his father&#8217;s death the boy did what the viciously spoiled Captain&#8217;s son did around just about everything in his life: he got nastily self-protective at the expense of others.I once heard someone say that if you try to hold back the hands of time in order to make it stand still, you&#8217;ll only get your arms broken.  So it is with the corruption of life that comes with ego-defensively holding back painful realities: it can eventually break one&#8217;s soul&#8212;which is what Freud tried to teach us.  The boy did that and behaved in that way around the question of his father&#8217;s death because he had learned how to do that from Granny&#8217;s initially unrelenting reaction to the father&#8217;s marriage.  Both Granny and the boy would eventually come to embrace their reality at the movie&#8217;s end when they all embraced the Christmas gift of shared grief.  In other words, we don&#8217;t have to go through the rough spots alone; there are always others who can help us carry the heaviest loads (if only we would let them)&#8212;as the Captain knew when he brought home his blind daughter&#8217;s emotionally very generous companion, and as the Captain&#8217;s wife would find out when she would embrace the reality that Black child represented (and which she had fought so hard against accepting prior to the fire, the fight making her as nasty as the Captain&#8217;s son).As you can see, I saw this film allegorically.  It&#8217;s the sort of thing up to two hundred years ago people would write mythopoetic odes about, to be told/recited by the cleansing and community uniting fire (fire being a major theme in this movie, both in terms of the fireplace and chimney, as well as in the burning down of the house).  The movie uses fire to remind us that Death always comes unpredictably (as we are shown by the passing of both the blind daughter and her companion very soon after the matter of the jewels is resolved); hence the fullness of life should not be put off and wasted on meanness and denial.  In all bad there is much good to be found, but only if we embrace it as is, and not try to hold it back from realization as if that could keep it from being so.That&#8217;s a heavy lesson taught in very light steps taken to a very soothing musical score.  I once saw a PBS program on how musicals had become a medium through which Jews well acquainted with persecution could express some astoundingly high ideals.  It was a real eye-opener for me because, on the basis of only the most precursory examination, I had dismissed that entire segment of the Broadway theater as mere dribble.  Don&#8217;t make the same mistake with this movie that I made with Broadway musicals.  Watch it again, and this time let this genteel dance in triple time touch your heart.  The people who put this thing together seemed to have understood that really big messages can only be delivered with ease, grace, circumspection, and above all else infinite aplomb.",5,"The pacing . .

1406805,AB34G6VKP28L,B004GEGW44,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[216, 220]","Based on a well-known children's book series by Lucy M. Boston, From Time to Time is a sentimental and touching story about ghostly encounters in the aftermath of wartime.Although WWII is drawing to an end, there are still a number of British soldiers unaccounted for -- among them is the father of young Tolly (Alex Etel), who has been sent to live with his grandmother (Maggie Smith) while his own mother attempts to use her political connections to discern his father's whereabouts. Moving into the old manor house, Tolly becomes fascinated with its romantic and frequently tragic history. The paintings in the main hall tell a story of past generations and over a hundred year old mystery. But that is not all the secrets the old house contains, for after a ghostly encounter, Tolly becomes convinced the place is haunted. But it seems to contain more magic than that, for sometimes he encounters specters... and sometimes he is the ghost in their world. Weaving in and out of time, he becomes involved in the lives of the great old family that once lived there...With a mean-spirited son and a blind daughter to look after, not to mention his bored, aristocratic wife (Carice van Houten) feeling neglected, it is all Captain Oldknow (Hugh Bonneville) can do to look after his affairs when he is on shore leave. On his most recent trip home he has brought a surprise for his daughter Susan (Eliza Bennett) -- a young Negro boy escaped from slavers, who will become her ""eyes"" and her companion. His son Sefton (Douglas Booth) takes an immediate disliking for Jacob (Kwayedza Kureya) but he becomes invaluable to Susan. However, the malicious butler Caxton (Dominc West) is considering how best to be rid of him. Then comes the theft, and the fire, and no one knows the answers, but maybe Tolly, slipping in and out of his own time, can discern the truth before it is too late.Julian Fellowes is best known for Downton Abbey, but his adaptation of the novel is a charming one, and he proves a capable director. Emotion and suspense are present, but he does not distract his audience with peculiar camera angles, merely points them at the actors and allow their performances to shine through. It's quite a good cast -- Timothy Spall and Harriet Walter make notable appearances, but mostly I was impressed with the main characters. Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville are always good, but here we get to see a different side of her, playing a grandmother without a saucy side. Fans of the book may be frustrated with some of the changes made to the story, but as an independent production it's quite engaging, even if it is a little bit of a tearjerker toward the end.Although at times it moves a little slowly and the ending is a tad predictable, I enjoyed this film. It seems more lighthearted in many ways than your customary WWII drama and introduces some wonderful concepts, as well as exploring slightly more mature themes such as forgiveness, acceptance, racism, and coming together in a hard time, with little gusts of humor throughout. To my knowledge, it is not yet available in the United States but I am sure that with such a remarkable cast, it is only a matter of time.",4,Beautiful Childrens' Adaptation,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3181,"['Based', 'well-known', 'children', 'book', 'series', 'Lucy', 'M.', 'Boston', 'From', 'Time', 'Time', 'sentimental', 'touching', 'story', 'ghostly', 'encounters', 'aftermath', 'wartime.Although', 'WWII', 'drawing', 'end', 'are', 'still', 'number', 'British', 'soldiers', 'unaccounted', 'father', 'young', 'Tolly', 'Alex', 'Etel', 'who', 'been', 'sent', 'live', 'grandmother', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'own', 'mother', 'attempts', 'use', 'political', 'connections', 'discern', 'father', 'whereabouts', 'Moving', 'old', 'manor', 'house', 'Tolly', 'fascinated', 'romantic', 'frequently', 'tragic', 'history', 'paintings', 'main', 'hall', 'tell', 'story', 'past', 'generations', 'hundred', 'year', 'old', 'mystery', 'not', 'secrets', 'old', 'house', 'ghostly', 'encounter', 'Tolly', 'convinced', 'place', 'haunted', 'contain', 'more', 'magic', 'sometimes', 'specters', 'sometimes', 'ghost', 'world', 'Weaving', 'time', 'involved', 'lives', 'great', 'old', 'family', 'once', 'lived', 'mean-spirited', 'son', 'blind', 'daughter', 'look', 'not', 'mention', 'bored', 'aristocratic', 'wife', 'Carice', 'van', 'Houten', 'feeling', 'neglected', 'Captain', 'Oldknow', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'can', 'do', 'look', 'affairs', 'when', 'shore', 'leave', 'most', 'recent', 'trip', 'home', 'brought', 'surprise', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'Eliza', 'Bennett', 'young', 'Negro', 'boy', 'escaped', 'slavers', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'eyes', 'companion', 'son', 'Sefton', 'Douglas', 'Booth', 'immediate', 'disliking', 'Jacob', 'Kwayedza', 'Kureya', 'invaluable', 'Susan', 'However', 'malicious', 'butler', 'Caxton', 'Dominc', 'West', 'considering', 'how', 'best', 'be', 'rid', 'Then', 'theft', 'fire', 'one', 'answers', 'maybe', 'Tolly', 'slipping', 'own', 'time', 'can', 'discern', 'truth', 'too', 'late.Julian', 'Fellowes', 'best', 'known', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'charming', 'one', 'capable', 'director', 'Emotion', 'suspense', 'are', 'present', 'not', 'distract', 'audience', 'peculiar', 'camera', 'angles', 'merely', 'actors', 'allow', 'performances', 'shine', 'quite', 'good', 'cast', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Harriet', 'Walter', 'make', 'notable', 'appearances', 'mostly', 'was', 'impressed', 'main', 'characters', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'are', 'always', 'good', 'here', 'get', 'see', 'different', 'side', 'playing', 'grandmother', 'saucy', 'side', 'Fans', 'book', 'may', 'be', 'frustrated', 'changes', 'made', 'story', 'independent', 'production', 'quite', 'engaging', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'tearjerker', 'end.Although', 'times', 'little', 'slowly', 'ending', 'tad', 'predictable', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'many', 'ways', 'customary', 'WWII', 'drama', 'wonderful', 'concepts', 'as', 'well', 'exploring', 'slightly', 'more', 'mature', 'themes', 'such', 'forgiveness', 'acceptance', 'racism', 'coming', 'together', 'hard', 'time', 'little', 'gusts', 'humor', 'knowledge', 'not', 'yet', 'available', 'United', 'States', 'am', 'sure', 'remarkable', 'cast', 'only', 'matter', 'time']",N/A

Soon a ghost makes it possible for Tolly to travel backward in time, finding himself in his home in the late 18th century. There he gets the adventure of a lifetime, watching his ancestors as they suffer through one calamity after another.Though the story abounds with ghosts, the question presented here is whether ghosts and time traveling people can be separate things, or are they the same?

Boston's novel `The Chimneys of Green Knowe' and as expected, especially when he directs his own films the story though slight is filled with elegance, grace and rich atmosphere. With a splendid cast it truly comes to life.Set in 1940s England, 13-year-old Tolly (Alex Etel) is sent to stay with his grandmother (Maggie Smith) at her country home, which she fears she will have to sell due to money problems. Tolly's father is fighting in WWII, and is missing in action. As his grandmother tells him about the history of the house, and Tolly's ancestors, he finds that he is able to travel back in time to 1805 and discover secrets about his family's past, which still resonate today. The idea of time lapse is present in the story from 1805 - which centers around Tolly's ancestors, the kindly Captain Oldknow (Hugh Bonneville) and his selfish wife Maria (Carice van Houten) and their children Sefton, a spoiled, selfish young man (Douglas Booth) and a kindly, blind girl Susan (Eliza Bennett). Into their lives comes Jacob (Kwayedza Kureya), a former slave who escapes from captivity with the help of Captain Oldknow and joins the household as a companion for Susan, much to the chagrin of Sefton. The primary storyline is set in the 1940s, with Tolly and his grandmother worrying about what has become of Tolly's father, while at the same time getting to know and understand each other. &#8232;The cast is augmented with character roles played by Timothy Spall, Dominic West, Douglas Booth, Rachel Bell and Pauline Collins.This is a spirited adventure ghost story played two centuries apart and for those who enjoy the artistry of Julian Fellowes, this is a fine evening's diversion.

Like the screen-writer of the first Narnia movie, Fellowes added war-related tension to his framing story. In this case, the new material works well to define the characters and give their story some much-needed forward motion.The acting is uniformly superb, from Maggie Smith and Timothy Spall to the trio of children who carry much of the story. The costumes are gorgeous, and the ancient home on which the Green Knowe books are centered is well-represented by an actual stately home.This movie is not the funny, ribald preteen fare that American movie-makers usually provide, but it should appeal to families who enjoy more thoughtful child-centered stories such as Hugo and The Secret of Roan Inish.",5,Lovely adaptation of a favorite book,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,1020,"['Chimneys', 'Green', 'Knowe', 'published', 'U.S.', 'Treasure', 'Green', 'Knowe', 'most', 'dramatic', 'tightly-written', 'Lucy', 'M.', 'Boston', 'spooky', 'atmospheric', 'books', 'young', 'people', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'who', 'created', 'Gosford', 'PArk', 'later', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'wrote', 'directed', 'respectful', 'affectionate', 'adaptation', 'screen-writer', 'first', 'Narnia', 'movie', 'Fellowes', 'added', 'war-related', 'tension', 'framing', 'story', 'case', 'new', 'material', 'well', 'define', 'characters', 'give', 'story', 'much-needed', 'forward', 'motion.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'superb', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'trio', 'children', 'who', 'carry', 'much', 'story', 'costumes', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'ancient', 'home', 'Green', 'Knowe', 'books', 'are', 'centered', 'well-represented', 'actual', 'stately', 'home.This', 'movie', 'not', 'funny', 'ribald', 'preteen', 'fare', 'American', 'movie-makers', 'usually', 'provide', 'should', 'appeal', 'families', 'who', 'enjoy', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'child-centered', 'stories', 'such', 'Hugo', 'Secret', 'Roan', 'Inish']",N/A

From the start, there are clues that test one's temporal and historical placing disbelief. Suspense is mostly lacking where it could have played a decisive role in carrying the movie. Some characters are too matter of fact about the paranormal goings on. The script could have been adjusted greatly to make this more believable.

The film is set during WWII and his father is missing in action, so his grandmother tells him stories about the family to keep him distracted. One night, he sees a ghost (in a very startling scene) and when he approaches his grandmother about it she doesn't deny that there are ghosts at the estate. As time goes on, he sees more and more apparitions and actually participates in the past. In doing so he solves a very old family mystery.I spotted four actors from Downton Abbey, which makes sense because the director of this film created Downton.

Writer/Director Julian Fellowes 'FROM TIME TO TIME'-2008 approaches its subject from the point of view of its main character brilliantly played by Alex Etel and we the audience are introduced and experience each clue as the story progresses.  You've read about the story and characters in the reviews within so its great to discuss the production by Luciana Arrighi and the cinematography by Alan Almond which bounces you back and forth from 1809 to 1940 with the greatest of ease.  The performances are outstanding by all including a villainous take by Dominic West , absolutely shattering characters portrayed by Dame Maggie Smith and Pauline Collins plus a surprise appearance by Timothy Spall.  The transfer is in a 1.85 ratio with subtitles if needed and includes a feature called Cast and Crew Interviews with main actors (not Dame Maggie Smith, unfortunately) and behind the scenes filmmaking.  A trailer for the film rounds out the special features.  It contains so much heart and soul that it must be experienced rather than talked about and it has become one of my favorite films of all time.

His mother remains in London, trying to get information on the fate of Tolly's father who is missing in action.Initially, Tolly resents his granny because he thinks she dislikes his mother, but gradually a close bond forms between the two. Tolly discovers that the estate is in financial trouble and that his granny may be forced to sell it. Tolly also makes another startling discovery - that the estate is haunted by the spirits of a previous generation of Oldknow's, mainly young Susan (Eliza Bennett) who lived in the house more than a century earlier. Susan's father, Captain Oldknow (Hugh Bonneville) is a kind seafaring man who brings home an escaped slave named Jacob and provides for him, expecting only that Jacob be Susan's companion, for Susan is blind. But Maria, the Captain's Dutch wife (played by Carice Van Houten ofBlack Book) is not keen on the boy and spends her days squandering the Captain's wealth. The couple's only son, Sefton (Douglas Booth) is a spoilt brat who abhors Jacob, and finds ways and means to make Jacob's life miserable.Tolly finds himself not only able to see some of these ghosts but also to be able to travel back in time (it is never explained how this happens) and witness events in the past. This later proves fortuitous as Tolly makes an important discovery that could very well save his granny's estate.The story plays out quite well and is beautifully filmed.
