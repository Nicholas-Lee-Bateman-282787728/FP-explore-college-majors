However, I liked her teaching style and the simplicity so I looked through the offerings and found this video.  Boy am I glad I tried it!Some poses are challenging but I was able to do them all even being very overweight.  I like she isn't model-perfect and willowy or ripped like some of the other videos I've tried.  Made me feel more at ease.  And her peaceful expression is so calming.The included meditation time was perfect.  The music was gentle and unobtrusive and I enjoyed the simple beautiful scenery and visuals of the rippling water.  I did the whole video and was suprised when I was still lying on the floor for several minutes after the video had finished!  The PERFECT way to end my workout week, stretch out my whole body, relax and find my inner balance so that I'm ready for the week ahead.  I can't recommend this enough!  I will be buying the DVD.",5,Just what I was looking for!,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,991,"['tried', 'different', 'Yoga', 'video', 'first', 'Ms.', 'Barrio', 'was', 'too', 'fast-paced', 'difficult', ""'m"", 'Yoga', 'beginner', 'However', 'liked', 'teaching', 'style', 'simplicity', 'so', 'looked', 'offerings', 'found', 'video', 'Boy', 'am', 'glad', 'tried', 'poses', 'are', 'challenging', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'all', 'even', 'being', 'very', 'overweight', ""n't"", 'model-perfect', 'willowy', 'ripped', 'other', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'Made', 'feel', 'more', 'ease', 'peaceful', 'expression', 'so', 'calming.The', 'included', 'meditation', 'time', 'was', 'perfect', 'music', 'was', 'gentle', 'unobtrusive', 'enjoyed', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'visuals', 'rippling', 'water', 'did', 'whole', 'video', 'was', 'suprised', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'lying', 'floor', 'several', 'minutes', 'video', 'had', 'finished', 'PERFECT', 'way', 'end', 'workout', 'week', 'stretch', 'whole', 'body', 'relax', 'find', 'inner', 'balance', ""'m"", 'ready', 'week', 'ahead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'enough', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'DVD']",N/A

I selected this one based on reviews as to the instruction and pace of this offering.  I was not disappointed.  The instructor is great.

The pace is slow enough to achieve the posture correctly, but it also moves along well so you don't lose focus or patience.

The menu allows you to choose the most appropriate segment...depending on your energy level and time constraints.  The pacing (not too fast) and narration is first rate.  She takes the time to explain how to move into and hold a pose, something most other yoga instructors neglect.  Granted, the workouts are not as intensive as in other DVDs, but I always feel like I've had a great stretch after doing one or several of the sequences.  I bought a yoga bolster just so I could do the restorative poses on the last segment.  Highly recommended.",5,Very well thought-out!

I decided to try this tape, and I love it! She does things very slowly.  The poses are easy for beginners.  Some of the later ones require a belt, bolster, and block.

1343141,A21MLY6WLBZJ28,B003F76MX4,jewelz,"[11, 32]","My main impression of this DVD is that I, as a person without movie-making experience, could have done a better job filming it.  The yoga instruction is so-so, and Kanta Barrios holds some of the poses for a good long time, but there are some aspects that are really off.  The setting looks like it was done on a public pier (This was filmed in the Canary Islands?  Really?  It looks like it was filmed at some lake because there is only water with lake-sized waves and the pier shown), and the sound is unclear. I can barely hear the music in the background, and the instructor's voice is muffled.  The camera work is not well done. When she bends over her legs for some poses, I can see what looks like the back of pink underwear.  Her black outfit looks worn to the point of being shiny.  That was one of the first things I noticed, and I can't imagine that whoever made this DVD wouldn't buy Ms. Barrios a new exercise outfit~ that wouldn't cost too much and it would look more professional.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the yoga isn't too bad, but really if I knew the true nature of the DVD, I wouldn't have bought it.  The reason I did buy the DVD is that there were some positive reviews of it on here, and after viewing the DVD,I don't believe that those reviews were real and sincere.",3,Low Production Values,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1296,"['main', 'impression', 'DVD', 'person', 'movie-making', 'experience', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'filming', 'yoga', 'instruction', 'so-so', 'Kanta', 'Barrios', 'poses', 'good', 'long', 'time', 'are', 'aspects', 'are', 'really', 'setting', 'looks', 'was', 'done', 'public', 'pier', 'was', 'filmed', 'Canary', 'Islands', 'Really', 'was', 'filmed', 'lake', 'only', 'water', 'lake-sized', 'waves', 'pier', 'shown', 'sound', 'unclear', 'can', 'barely', 'hear', 'music', 'background', 'instructor', 'voice', 'muffled', 'camera', 'work', 'not', 'well', 'done', 'When', 'legs', 'poses', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'back', 'pink', 'underwear', 'black', 'outfit', 'worn', 'point', 'being', 'shiny', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'things', 'noticed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'whoever', 'made', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Ms.', 'Barrios', 'new', 'exercise', 'outfit~', 'would', ""n't"", 'cost', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'look', 'more', 'professional', ""'m"", 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'yoga', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'really', 'knew', 'true', 'nature', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'reason', 'did', 'buy', 'DVD', 'were', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'reviews', 'were', 'real', 'sincere']",N/A
