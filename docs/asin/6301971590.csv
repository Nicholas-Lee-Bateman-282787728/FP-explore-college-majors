I doubt whether any of the rest of the cast will look familiar to you, unless you are quite the old movie buff. It's a pretty good movie, for all it's old enough to be genuinely corny.

Katharine Hepburn was one such luminous personality, and as if by sheer force of will she took this popular story and infused it with her incredible energy, making it a joy to watch even 70+ years later.  Also it's a pleasure to watch a simple story of a family living in the Civil War era without being confronted with controversies, politics, racism, etc.; just a story about a family that loves each other and is trying to get their four daughters from adolescence into adulthood with minimal trauma.Nonetheless, of course, there is trauma.  It's handled with as much melodrama as one would expect from a film of this era.  Remember, talking pictures had only been in existence for about five years, so the art form was still transitioning from the age of emoting to the age of verbal communication.  It shows in some places here, so this first film version of ""Little Women"" doesn't completely hold up all these decades later.  Regardless, once one gets past the first 15 to 20 minutes of exposition the story picks up and flows quite nicely, especially when Ms. Hepburn is front and center, which is often.There's nothing quite like her scene portraying playwright/actress Jo portraying an evil mustachioed villain and then quickly changing costume to portray a handsome romantic leading man.  Obviously this isn't a film top-heavy with the melodrama, there are quite a few good laughs and just general feel-good moments.

That much said, and allowing for the notion of women aged 24, 26, and 23 playing teens and sub-teens (Jean Parker, who plays Beth, was 18), it's a faithful and loving adaptation of the adventures of the four March girls (modelled on Alcott and her sisters), who, as the Civil War winds down, are enduring what they define as ""poverty"" (although they seem to me to be more middle-class, with a comfortable small house, a live-in cook, plenty to eat, a miniature piano, books, and pets) and trying to cope with the trials of growing up in Concord, N.H.  There's quiet, dutiful, ladylike Meg (Frances Dee), shy ""delicate"" Beth, artistic, affected Amy (Joan Bennett), and, of course, the unforgettable, irresistible, one-of-a-kind Jo (Katharine Hepburn)--a high-spirited ""tomboy"" (though we always see her in skirts), given to slang, snowball-throwing, fence-jumping, and wide-eyed exclamations of ""CHRIS-topher Co-LUM-bus!,"" frustrated with the limitations placed on females of the day, impatient with the need to earn money as a day-companion to her tyrannical and wealthy Aunt March (Edna May Oliver), inclined to chatter, yet warm-hearted, generous, and eager to travel and to become ""a famous writer.""  (Jo could, in some sense, be described as a younger version of several of the characters Hepburn later played in screwball comedies and in her team-ups with Spencer Tracy.)  When they befriend Laurie (Douglass Montgomery), the teenage boy who has come to live next door to them, and win over his crotchety grandfather (Henry Stephenson), their lives are changed forever, as Meg meets the man she will eventually marry, Laurie's tutor John Brooke (John Davis Lodge), and Jo's friendship with Laurie, which he longs to make more than that, eventually pushes her into going to New York, where she meets the German Prof. Bhaer (Paul Lukas), who calls her ""my little friend"" and encourages her to turn from the ""blood-and-thunder"" melodramas she's been successfully grinding out to something more ""real"" and ""true""--something that will, of course, eventually be the book on which the movie is based.  There's nothing very spectacular about the story or the people, and some viewers may even find it boring.  But those who have read and loved the book--which probably includes 90% of the literate females on the planet--will revel in its trueness to the original and enjoy even the sappy sentimentality that occasionally takes place.

There is a strong Christmas opening, and they fit in with the other warm hearted stories of the season. I bet devotees of the Alcott book were thrilled when this first came out, and that they were overall well pleased. It is a good representation of the spirit and unfolding of the wonderful story. I'm reminded that this was made during the Depression, which may have been created because it would appeal to those facing difficult circumstances. It is an upbeat example of people managing to be happy, finding simple pleasures, being successful in making the best of hard times.To me, the age thing was just part of what old Hollywood nearly always did. As for the parents, people often aged faster then. The father went through several years of the Civil War, an especially harsh one, and became seriously ill. He could have left home with a head of dark hair and come back with the white. And, a ""matron"" with children of that age was expected to look like one, which was pretty matronly, a negative term for us today. Besides, the Marshes were poor, the father having lost his money.  If Mrs. March would have had Aunt March's wardrobe budget, it might have made some difference. As for casting, I could flow with that as well, with the strong exception being the Laurie actor.But it is too good a story and this is too close to it to pick at things. I am just thankful they brought it to the screen this well. It never fails to impart a softening and sense of well being - what cynics call corny. It was somewhat emotive at times, being of the acting style of the time, but emotionally rich nonetheless. Mrs. March reminds me of some of my country aunts growing up, with her effusion of endearments, sweet expressions and gentle reminders. It sounded very odd to our citified ears on visits, but not actually displeasing. You can't tell me the type is unrealistic, because I've known it and so have a lot of others. It is not sickeningly sweet when genuine.Since comparisons are inevitable - to me, the '49 version was well done also, but not so with the modern versions. They tried to rewrite history, imposing today's ethics into those of more than 100 years ago. If they wanted to copy the premise, then change the title and period. Again, with any remake - don't change it around and call it the same thing. Besides, with a liberated woman re-theming, I would think the title would be off-putting.Ending on a positive note, this is a wonderful film with a great deal of interest, and I really appreciate having a good copy.",5,Screen Debut of a Beloved Story,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,2610,"['older', 'Little', 'Women', 'movies', 'have', 'become', 'part', 'regular', 'holiday', 'viewing', 'strong', 'Christmas', 'opening', 'fit', 'other', 'warm', 'hearted', 'stories', 'season', 'bet', 'devotees', 'Alcott', 'book', 'were', 'thrilled', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'were', 'overall', 'well', 'pleased', 'good', 'representation', 'spirit', 'unfolding', 'wonderful', 'story', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'was', 'made', 'Depression', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'would', 'appeal', 'facing', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'upbeat', 'example', 'people', 'managing', 'be', 'happy', 'finding', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'being', 'successful', 'making', 'best', 'hard', 'times.To', 'age', 'thing', 'was', 'just', 'part', 'what', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'nearly', 'always', 'did', 'parents', 'people', 'often', 'aged', 'faster', 'then', 'father', 'went', 'several', 'years', 'Civil', 'War', 'especially', 'harsh', 'one', 'became', 'seriously', 'ill', 'could', 'have', 'left', 'home', 'head', 'dark', 'hair', 'come', 'back', 'white', 'matron', 'children', 'age', 'was', 'expected', 'look', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'matronly', 'negative', 'term', 'today', 'Besides', 'Marshes', 'were', 'poor', 'father', 'having', 'lost', 'money', 'Mrs.', 'March', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'Aunt', 'March', 'wardrobe', 'budget', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'casting', 'could', 'flow', 'as', 'well', 'strong', 'exception', 'being', 'Laurie', 'actor.But', 'too', 'good', 'story', 'too', 'close', 'pick', 'things', 'am', 'just', 'thankful', 'brought', 'screen', 'well', 'never', 'impart', 'softening', 'sense', 'well', 'being', 'what', 'cynics', 'call', 'corny', 'was', 'somewhat', 'emotive', 'times', 'being', 'acting', 'style', 'time', 'emotionally', 'rich', 'nonetheless', 'Mrs.', 'March', 'country', 'aunts', 'growing', 'up', 'effusion', 'endearments', 'sweet', 'expressions', 'gentle', 'reminders', 'sounded', 'very', 'odd', 'citified', 'ears', 'visits', 'not', 'actually', 'displeasing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'type', 'unrealistic', ""'ve"", 'known', 'so', 'have', 'lot', 'others', 'not', 'sickeningly', 'sweet', 'when', 'genuine.Since', 'comparisons', 'are', 'inevitable', ""'49"", 'version', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'not', 'so', 'modern', 'versions', 'tried', 'rewrite', 'history', 'imposing', 'today', 'ethics', 'more', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'wanted', 'copy', 'premise', 'then', 'change', 'title', 'period', 'Again', 'remake', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'around', 'call', 'same', 'thing', 'Besides', 'liberated', 'woman', 're-theming', 'would', 'think', 'title', 'would', 'be', 'off-putting.Ending', 'positive', 'note', 'wonderful', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'interest', 'really', 'appreciate', 'having', 'good', 'copy']",N/A

It seems to me though, having watched most of the movies based on the famous book, that this version is the most heartfelt.  It's also the most skillfully done, benefitting from a great director (George Cukor) and following an Oscar winning screenplay adapted by husband and wife, Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman.  The movie was also nominated for best picture but inconceivably lost to Cavalcade, of all films!  Although not necessarily a Christmas movie, the story does begin with Christmas making it a good choice to view at this time of year.  It's episodic, following the lives and loves of the March sisters (well, almost all of them).  For the most part, the cast serves the film well, especially Edna May Oliver as Aunt March, the blistering matriarch of the March family.  It's almost a pleasure watching her be mean to everyone.  (My favorite scene is when she tosses the dog off her lap as she's getting up.)  This movie has it all, humor, pathos, and grim reality.

The clothes, the hairdos, the sets, cinematography, the musical score by Max Steiner and the brilliant script that brings to life  the timeless story -together they take you effortlessly to the Marches' world where you feel their true love and caring for one another, and follow their dreams, theirs hopes, and their heartbreaks. This is the film that made me jealous of the girls who have sisters by showing what treasure the sisters' love is. This is the movie which I want to watch with my Mom during the Mother's day and to tell her how much she means to me.

After all, it offers Katharine Hepburn as Jo March, whereas later versions have offered June Allyson, Meredith Baxter Birney (for TV), and Winona Ryder in her place (Although Claire Dane's deathbed scene in the 1994 version is magnificent).  But the entire cast of this film is superb from top to bottom: Joan Bennett as Amy, Jean Park as Beth, Frances Dee as Meg, and Spring Byington as Marmee, with Paul Lukas as Professor Bhaer, Douglass Montgomery as Laurie, and Edna May Oliver threatening to steal every scene she is in as Aunt March.Hepburn won the Cannes International Film Festival award as Best Actress of 1934, and it seems reasonable to suggest that her performance in ""Little Women"" helped Hepburn win her first Academy Award for ""Morning Glory,"" which had come out the previous year (much as Diane Keaton was helped by having done ""Saving Mr. Goodbar"" the same year as ""Annie Hall"" when she won her Oscar).  ""Little Women"" was nominated for Best Picture that year, because the team behind the camera of this RKO film was equally as strong.  The film was produced by David O'Selznick and director George Cukor was nominated for an Oscar as well, although surprisingly none of the actors received nominations.  The film's one award went to Y. Mason and Victor Heerman, who most deservedly won for Best Screenplay Adaptation.This is arguably Hepburn's best performance in her first dozen films, although some dismiss it as being too close to home for the actress.  It would be decades before critics decided that when Katharine Hepburn played herself no one could equal her, and ""Little Women"" certainly foreshadows her later successes.  It would be nice if at least the sound on this 67 year old film could be restored, but if you can get past it being in black and white this is the ""Little Women"" to show your children.Note:  Interesting that this video tape is not currently available by itself, but it is as part of a three tape set of Hepburn films.

It is also a pretty faithful adaptation of  Ms. Alcott's classic. Though there may be a half dozen adaptations, of the three that I have seen this one is, undoubtedly, the best. Its writing deservedly won the Academy Award in 1933 for Best Screenplay Adaptation. It is unfortunate, however, that although the film was also nominated for the Best Picture Award, it lost to &quot;Cavalcade&quot;, a largely forgotten, lesser film.Deftly directed by George Cukor,  the film tells the story of the March family, whose patriarch has gone off to fight in the Union Army during the Civil War. Mrs. March is left to raise her four daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, in nineteenth century New England. The film focuses on the personal interactions family members have with each other, as well as with their friends and neighbors, in order to create a portrait of an idealized, loving family held together during trying times. It is also a very poignant coming of age film.The film primarily revolves around the March sisters, with the focus on independent and headstrong Jo, an aspiring writer, as well as a tomboy and second oldest of the four sisters. In addition to the March family, a wealthy neighbor's nephew, Laurie, plays a prominent role in the life of the March family, with a lesser one played by the family's wealthy Aunt March.This film is beautifully cast, with a luminous Katherine Hepburn perfect in the lead role. As Jo March, Ms. Hepburn captures the essence of this beloved character. Feisty, independent, loving, and intelligent, her characterization of Jo is inspired, though Ms. Hepburn may not have strayed  too far from her own persona.Spring Byington is wonderful as mother to the March daughters, while Frances Dee, Jean Parker, and Joan Bennett are uniformly excellent in the respective roles of Meg, Beth, and Amy, the sisters whom Jo so dearly loves. Douglass Montgomery is superb as Laurie, Jo's best friend, though his painted lips and shadowed eyelids are a bit  anachronistic and a style holdover from the silent screen era.Paul Lukas is endearing as the Professor, Jo's mature love interest.  Henry Stephensen is effective as the generous, elderly neighbor, Mr. James Lawrence, uncle to Laurie. Veteran character actress, Edna Mae Oliver, rounds out this superlative cast as cantankerous Aunt March and shamelessly steals every scene in which she appears.This is a wonderful vintage film that would be a welcome addition to the personal collection of those who love beautifully made, classic films.

I've seen this one, of course, as well as June Allyson's, Susan Dey's, and Winona Ryder's, and a PBS one years ago which featured an extremely pouty gal with a protruding lower lip as Jo. Interestingly enough, though, one evening I rented both Kate's and June's and played them back to back to determine how each measured up against the other. While Kate brings a quality of haplessness to the role that June doesn't, I found to my surprise that OVERALL  I preferred the June Allyson movie. Why? Better film quality, color as opposed to black and white (shouldn't make a difference, but it was attractive), and a cast better known to me from other pictures than Kate's; the 15 years between the pictures makes a great difference for more modern audiences in that respect--imagine, Elizabeth Taylor as Amy!. For more on the June Allyson version, see my full review treatment there. Back to Kate for now.  As I mentioned, Kate's haplessness is right out of the book, one of the overriding characteristics of Jo March. Like many of Selznick's earlier pictures (see &quot;David Copperfield&quot;), there is an antique quality to the movie and some of the acting is a wee bit too dated and histrionic. Depending on whom you watch the movie with, that may matter. The first half of the movie, prior to Jo's moving to NY, is the better part. I have always loved the scene where she is being chased over the hills and fences by Laurie with Max Steiner's score cheerily bouncing away, only to come upon her sister Meg trying to be so dignified with her beau Mr. Brooke--Jo's realization that their childhood days are coming to an end with Meg's changing interests and reproof of Jo's tomboy antics. Edna May Oliver gets my vote for the best Aunt March yet--I suppose she really only ever plays one part in every movie you see her in, but that's what can be so effective about character actors and typecasting.  Incidentally, I wish ALL versions would drop the playacting sequences--I've always been bored out of my mind by those scenes, even though I realize Alcott devoted a lot of time to them in the book.

For the most part it is a very faithful adaptation of the beloved novel (which I finished reading two days before viewing this version).  Unfortunately, some parts are too faithful - like the first fifteen or twenty minutes.  This part is almost verbatim from the book and was soooooo slow!  I was worried that the entire movie would be this way and be six hours long.  Thank goodness the screenwriters began condensing after this long opening sequence.The actresses playing the four March sisters did a good job but they all looked approximately the same age leaving no room for age progression throughout the movie.  The acting was okay for its time - but by today's standards it comes off as very melodramatic.  Hepburn was a suitably tomboyish Jo but even she had her unintentional laughable moments - particularly the ""swoon"" as Prof. Bhaer was playing the piano and singing.

282532,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,6301971590,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[0, 3]","This movie is based on the story of novelist Luisa May Alcott who studied under the tutelage of such luminaries as; Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Margaret Fuller. Little Women is one of her best stories based on her personal experiences as a young woman growing up with three sisters in Concord, MA. This is one of the early literary works Hollywood ever used to make movies and it was great success. This story was used again and again in as many 10 versions including this truly classic made (1933) during the height of Great Depression.The story is woven around the Civil War era about a family living in Concord, Massachusetts. The family consists of four daughters; Jo March (Katherine Hepburn), Meg March (Frances Dee), Amy March (Joan Bennett), and Beth March (Jean Parker). The story is essentially about the lives of four girls and how they grow up and eventually get married and have their own families. It is a tremendous film about family, and a character study of four little girls. When their father Mr. March (Samuel Hinds) is away as a minister serving at the war front, the mother, Marmee (Spring Byington) takes care of the family. To keep their spirits high while living in poverty, the four girls form a strong bond. Amy is selfish and timid, but Beth is sensitive who practices on her broken-down clavichord. Meg is envious who works as a seamstress, and Jo (a true self of author Luisa May Alcott) is spirited and tomboyish, who dreams of becoming a famous author. The four girls also have a well-to-do Aunt March (Edna May Oliver) who cares them.Jo is in love with her wealthy next-door neighbor Laurie Laurence (Douglas Montgomery) whose grandfather Mr. Laurence (Henry Stephenson) terrified her for years. To strengthen their friendship, the Laurie invites the girls to a lavish party, at which Meg meets Laurie's tutor, John Brooke. Over the next few months, while Meg is being romanced by John, Jo has her first short story published and Beth overcomes some of her shyness so that she can practice on Mr. Laurence's fine piano.When mother Marmee leaves her daughters to see her husband in Washington D.C. who was wounded at the warfront. Beth contracts scarlet fever and her fever worsens, and Jo prays that Marmee will return before she dies and tearfully reveals her deepest fears to Laurie: Beth survives and she is reunited with both Marmee and her father. There is a tremendous amount of sorrow for March family, and the sadness that ensues, is splendidly directed by Cukor with great deal of sensitivity.  At the end, Beth passes away, Meg marries John much to the dissatisfaction of the family, and Jo spurns the love of Laurie, moves out to New York City to work for a German professor named Bhaer (Paul Lukas). Amy falls in love with Laurie and marries him, and Bhaer falls in love with Jo.This story is set during Christmas time; hence you may want to add this movie to your Christmas movie list. My favorite scenes are; as a Christmas present, Aunt March gives each of the girls one dollar, which they then decide to spend on presents for their mother; she asks them to donate their holiday breakfast to the impoverished Hummel family. The drama scenes in which the four sisters perform for local children (theses are fun times for the family) is brilliantly directed. Hepburn was only 26 when she made this movie and she was beautiful and very talented: This was captured by one of the best of Hollywood, director George Cukor.1.Little Women2.Little Women (Collector's Series)3.American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work4.Holiday",5,A truly classic movie of Katherine Hepburn and Director Cukor,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,3702,"['movie', 'based', 'story', 'novelist', 'Luisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'who', 'studied', 'tutelage', 'such', 'luminaries', 'Ralph', 'Waldo', 'Emerson', 'Henry', 'David', 'Thoreau', 'Margaret', 'Fuller', 'Little', 'Women', 'one', 'best', 'stories', 'based', 'personal', 'experiences', 'young', 'woman', 'growing', 'up', 'three', 'sisters', 'Concord', 'MA', 'one', 'early', 'literary', 'works', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'used', 'make', 'movies', 'was', 'great', 'success', 'story', 'was', 'used', 'again', 'again', 'as', 'many', '10', 'versions', 'including', 'truly', 'classic', 'made', '1933', 'height', 'Great', 'Depression.The', 'story', 'woven', 'Civil', 'War', 'era', 'family', 'living', 'Concord', 'Massachusetts', 'family', 'four', 'daughters', 'Jo', 'March', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Meg', 'March', 'Frances', 'Dee', 'Amy', 'March', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'Beth', 'March', 'Jean', 'Parker', 'story', 'essentially', 'lives', 'four', 'girls', 'how', 'grow', 'up', 'eventually', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'own', 'families', 'tremendous', 'film', 'family', 'character', 'study', 'four', 'little', 'girls', 'When', 'father', 'Mr.', 'March', 'Samuel', 'Hinds', 'away', 'minister', 'serving', 'war', 'front', 'mother', 'Marmee', 'Spring', 'Byington', 'care', 'family', 'keep', 'spirits', 'high', 'living', 'poverty', 'four', 'girls', 'form', 'strong', 'bond', 'Amy', 'selfish', 'timid', 'Beth', 'sensitive', 'who', 'practices', 'broken-down', 'clavichord', 'Meg', 'envious', 'who', 'seamstress', 'Jo', 'true', 'self', 'author', 'Luisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'spirited', 'tomboyish', 'who', 'becoming', 'famous', 'author', 'four', 'girls', 'also', 'have', 'well-to-do', 'Aunt', 'March', 'Edna', 'May', 'Oliver', 'who', 'them.Jo', 'love', 'wealthy', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Laurie', 'Laurence', 'Douglas', 'Montgomery', 'grandfather', 'Mr.', 'Laurence', 'Henry', 'Stephenson', 'terrified', 'years', 'strengthen', 'friendship', 'Laurie', 'girls', 'lavish', 'party', 'Meg', 'Laurie', 'tutor', 'John', 'Brooke', 'next', 'few', 'months', 'Meg', 'being', 'romanced', 'John', 'Jo', 'first', 'short', 'story', 'published', 'Beth', 'shyness', 'can', 'practice', 'Mr.', 'Laurence', 'fine', 'piano.When', 'mother', 'Marmee', 'daughters', 'see', 'husband', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'who', 'was', 'wounded', 'warfront', 'Beth', 'contracts', 'scarlet', 'fever', 'fever', 'worsens', 'Jo', 'Marmee', 'will', 'return', 'tearfully', 'deepest', 'fears', 'Laurie', 'Beth', 'survives', 'reunited', 'Marmee', 'father', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'sorrow', 'March', 'family', 'sadness', 'splendidly', 'directed', 'Cukor', 'great', 'deal', 'sensitivity', 'end', 'Beth', 'away', 'Meg', 'John', 'much', 'dissatisfaction', 'family', 'Jo', 'love', 'Laurie', 'out', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'work', 'German', 'professor', 'named', 'Bhaer', 'Paul', 'Lukas', 'Amy', 'love', 'Laurie', 'marries', 'Bhaer', 'love', 'Jo.This', 'story', 'set', 'Christmas', 'time', 'hence', 'may', 'want', 'add', 'movie', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'list', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'are', 'Christmas', 'present', 'Aunt', 'March', 'girls', 'one', 'dollar', 'then', 'decide', 'spend', 'presents', 'mother', 'donate', 'holiday', 'breakfast', 'impoverished', 'Hummel', 'family', 'drama', 'scenes', 'four', 'sisters', 'perform', 'local', 'children', 'theses', 'are', 'fun', 'times', 'family', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'only', '26', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'beautiful', 'very', 'talented', 'was', 'captured', 'one', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'George', 'Cukor.1.Little', 'Women2.Little', 'Women', 'Collector', 'Series', '3.American', 'Bloomsbury', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'Ralph', 'Waldo', 'Emerson', 'Margaret', 'Fuller', 'Nathaniel', 'Hawthorne', 'Henry', 'David', 'Thoreau', 'Lives', 'Their', 'Loves', 'Their', 'Work4.Holiday']",N/A

Lane,"[4, 4]","Without comparing this version of Little Women to the 1994 remake I grew up with, I can heartily endorse it as fun-loving, wholesome family entertainment that does justice to a story we hold dear. I suppose one has to develope a taste for these older movies, however . . . and I'm not thinking about the black and white. There are so many parts where it's hard to keep up with the diolog, probably because I'm used to newer movies where they always zoom in on who ever is speaking. Katherine Hepburn did good acting, there is no doubt . . . but looked too old for a teenage role, and she oddly resembled Lucy (""I Love Lucy""), giving me a weird feeling about her through the first half of the movie. The potrayel of her sister/brother relationship with Laurie was brought out better in this movie than in any other, in my opinion. In the 1949 one Laurie seemed to be sweet on her to begin with, and that wasn't the way it was in the book. In the 1994 one with Christian Bale and Winona Ryder, their relationship was playful, but in the book they also ""quarreled"" a lot, and the 1994 version didn't bring that out enough to explain Jo's rejection of his suit. The Laurie in this 1933 version, however, looked way younger than Jo, and a bit frail. And, too, his facial expressions were sometimes nerdy, and sometimes cute, making me edgy. The Beth they had was PERFECT, as was the Amy, but Meg's character was a bit flat, as she wasn't given many lines, and I only remember one scene which Mr. March was in. John Brook was also a side character. Mr. Lawrence and Aunt March were given big parts, though, and were highly entertaining. The Marmee they had gave a sincere effort, you could tell, and truly seemed the warm, caring mother of four girls from Alcott's novel. I would reckon that most of her acting career was on the stage, however, because it shows in her overworked gestures, facial expressions, and intonation. (Stage actors had to be overly dramatic in a time before the magic of fancy camera work.) Jo's Proffessor from the 1994 movie is and will remain my die-hard favorite. The new version did the best with Jo and the Proffessor's romance. My favorite thing about this movie was the quiet, unforced reverence it radiates. Marmee and her girls are shown praying at different times and even sing ""Abide With Me"" as Beth plays the piano, and the March girls are rightly concerned about fashioning their characters as best they can. Very wholesome stuff.

LITTLE WOMEN fully captures the joy and feeling of the classic 1868 classic by Louisa May Alcott. Katharine's playing of Jo is vibrant and she captures Jo's tomboy qualities yet also delicately projects the beauty and intellect of Jo as a woman and budding writer. Paul Lukas made the German professor both manly and tenderly lovable. Spring Byington, as Marmee, is the only one who seems to have stepped out of an old-fashioned Sunday School book - she's unmistakably smug, and proud of it. Highly episodic, the movie focuses on the characters without slavishly following a plot. The very young Joan Bennett is terrific as Amy, who's ever scheming for the &quot;good life&quot; and Douglass Montgomery has the boundless energy needed in his playing of Laurie. A must-see for the fans of Alcott and Hepburn while others will find it enjoyable as a family film.",5,EXCELLENT FAMILY FARE.,944697600,"12 9, 1999",1999,984,"['simple', 'classic', 'tale', 'warm', 'human', 'innocent', 'how', 'four', 'girls', 'grew', 'up', 'good', 'times', 'sad', 'times', 'LITTLE', 'WOMEN', 'fully', 'joy', 'feeling', 'classic', '1868', 'classic', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'Katharine', 'playing', 'Jo', 'vibrant', 'Jo', 'tomboy', 'qualities', 'yet', 'also', 'delicately', 'projects', 'beauty', 'intellect', 'Jo', 'woman', 'budding', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Lukas', 'made', 'German', 'professor', 'manly', 'tenderly', 'lovable', 'Spring', 'Byington', 'Marmee', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'have', 'stepped', 'old-fashioned', 'Sunday', 'School', 'book', 'unmistakably', 'smug', 'proud', 'Highly', 'episodic', 'movie', 'characters', 'slavishly', 'following', 'plot', 'very', 'young', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'terrific', 'Amy', 'who', 'ever', 'scheming', 'quot', 'good', 'life', 'quot', 'Douglass', 'Montgomery', 'boundless', 'energy', 'needed', 'playing', 'Laurie', 'must-see', 'fans', 'Alcott', 'Hepburn', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'film']",N/A

282546,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6301971590,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","This 1933 Hollywood adaptation of Little Women is lavishly produced and a true classic. The story itself is a family drama, centering on the lives of the March sisters - Meg [Frances Dee], Jo [Katharine Hepburn], Beth [Jean Parker], and Amy [Joan Bennett] who live with their mother, Marmie in a New England town during the time of the Civil War, whilst their father is away fighting.Of all the movie adaptations, this 1933 version is the most faithful to the novel and though not my personal favorite [I love the 1949 version with June Allyson the best], I still love it for Katharine Hepburn's performance as the feisty, independent-minded Jo March who harbors dreams of becoming a published author. The actresses who play the sisters are all quite good, but somehow pale in comparison to the latter versions [I liked Elizabeth Taylor's performance as Amy in the 1949 version, and Claire Danes' performance as Beth in the 1994 adaptation.The actor who portrayed Laurie was the weakest of all the adaptations. Apart from the lack of good looks [seeming almost girlish in some scenes], he also lacks stature and credibility in his portrayal of Laurie. Other than that, the production details are convincing and well-done, and I also like this version for staying as true as it could to the novel by Louisa May Alcott.
