1235600,A1MFDFUGEVNIFK,B001T46TUG,AyJay,"[5, 7]","FOR THE RECORD is an MTV documentry, recorded over the course of 60 days, starting 5th September 2008, the day before Britney attended the MTV Video Music Awards [She won 3 awards for work on her 'Blackout' album].The documenty's main focus is in following Britney as she prepares for her sixth album; In the recording studio [she actually does have an agreeable voice without adding all the vocal effects. She's certainly no Mariah, but she is capable of out-singing a lot of other pop acts like Chezza or Katy Perry], selecting dancers for her music videos, shooting the music videos [for 'Womanizer' and 'Circus]' and making a live appearance at a Madonna concert.While it interesting to see how a celebrity puts in their hours of work, almost everyone will watch this hoping for some insight on her devestating mental breakdown...To her credit she does answer every question asked her [including head-shaving, Justin Timberlake and second husband Kevin Federline], most of her answers are vague, sometimes rambling and they don't really scratch below the surface of the chosen subject. I've watched the DVD a few times now, and can't decide if she's trying to protect the last bit of privacy she has left or if she is still lost.Among the non-answers there are a few that are are clear and quite heartbreaking, like when she talks about living under the conservationship of her father: ""There's no excitement, there's no passion...I have really good days, and then I have bad days. Even when you go to jail, you know there's the time when you're gonna get out. But in this situation, it's never ending. It's just like Groundhog Day every day.""To be totally honest - being Britney Spears doesn't seem exciting, it seemsempty and sad: Her own house is always swarming with people, all of her 'friends' are people she works with or family members, she is followed everywhere by abusive paparazzi and her Dad even follows her to work.The scene that sticks with me is about half-way through the documentry when Britney is at the 'Womanizer' video shoot; ""I'm angry, I'm really angry. I'm horribly angry"" she says, whilst everyone there laughs at her. She broadens her clearly fake grin and tiredly sighs ""I'm smiling right now because I think it's funny that you are all laughing"". Later her eyes well up as she tells the interviewer ""When I tell people how I'm feeling it's like they hear me, but they're not really listening. They hear what they want to hear"".That really makes me question if she's making music again because she really feels ready to or if people around her are shoving her back into the limelight. All of the media's crazy stories and conspiracy theories about Britney being some sort of prisoner don't seem quite so insane now.This isn't easy viewing, but is something I highly recommend owning; When you're next enviously eyeing up a celebrity's seemingly charmed life in a magazine, you'll consider this and then the lifestyle won't seem so great.",4,Not easy to watch...,1280016000,"07 25, 2010",2010,2970,"['RECORD', 'MTV', 'documentry', 'recorded', 'course', '60', 'days', 'starting', '5th', 'September', '2008', 'day', 'Britney', 'attended', 'MTV', 'Video', 'Music', 'Awards', '[', 'won', '3', 'awards', 'work', ""'Blackout"", 'album', '.The', 'documenty', 'main', 'focus', 'following', 'Britney', 'sixth', 'album', 'recording', 'studio', '[', 'actually', 'have', 'agreeable', 'voice', 'adding', 'vocal', 'effects', 'certainly', 'Mariah', 'capable', 'out-singing', 'lot', 'other', 'pop', 'acts', 'Chezza', 'Katy', 'Perry', ']', 'selecting', 'dancers', 'music', 'videos', 'shooting', 'music', 'videos', '[', ""'Womanizer"", ']', 'making', 'live', 'appearance', 'Madonna', 'concert.While', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'celebrity', 'hours', 'work', 'almost', 'everyone', 'will', 'watch', 'hoping', 'insight', 'devestating', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'credit', 'answer', 'question', 'asked', '[', 'including', 'head-shaving', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'second', 'husband', 'Kevin', 'Federline', ']', 'most', 'answers', 'are', 'vague', 'sometimes', 'rambling', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'scratch', 'surface', 'chosen', 'subject', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'DVD', 'few', 'times', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'trying', 'protect', 'last', 'bit', 'privacy', 'left', 'still', 'lost.Among', 'non-answers', 'are', 'few', 'are', 'are', 'clear', 'quite', 'heartbreaking', 'when', 'living', 'conservationship', 'father', 'excitement', 'passion', 'have', 'really', 'good', 'days', 'then', 'have', 'bad', 'days', 'Even', 'when', 'go', 'jail', 'know', 'time', 'when', ""'re"", 'gon', 'get', 'out', 'situation', 'never', 'ending', 'just', 'like', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'day', 'be', 'totally', 'honest', 'being', 'Britney', 'Spears', ""n't"", 'seem', 'exciting', 'seemsempty', 'sad', 'own', 'house', 'always', 'swarming', 'people', ""'friends"", 'are', 'people', 'family', 'members', 'followed', 'everywhere', 'abusive', 'paparazzi', 'Dad', 'even', 'work.The', 'scene', 'half-way', 'documentry', 'when', 'Britney', ""'Womanizer"", 'video', 'shoot', ""'m"", 'angry', ""'m"", 'really', 'angry', ""'m"", 'horribly', 'angry', 'whilst', 'everyone', 'there', 'clearly', 'fake', 'grin', 'tiredly', ""'m"", 'smiling', 'right', 'now', 'think', 'funny', 'are', 'laughing', 'Later', 'eyes', 'well', 'up', 'interviewer', 'When', 'tell', 'people', 'how', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'hear', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'listening', 'hear', 'what', 'want', 'hear', 'really', 'question', 'making', 'music', 'again', 'really', 'ready', 'people', 'are', 'shoving', 'back', 'limelight', 'media', 'crazy', 'stories', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'Britney', 'being', 'sort', 'prisoner', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'so', 'insane', 'now.This', ""n't"", 'easy', 'viewing', 'something', 'highly', 'recommend', 'owning', 'When', ""'re"", 'next', 'enviously', 'eyeing', 'up', 'celebrity', 'seemingly', 'charmed', 'life', 'magazine', ""'ll"", 'consider', 'then', 'lifestyle', 'wo', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'great']",Britney: For The Record
1235601,A2EUG9W2IAVCT,B001T46TUG,C. Eberlein,"[2, 3]","She's Britney Spears, arguably the world's most famous female pop star.  Her ups and downs have provided more fire for the tabloids than anyone in the past few years, and yet her success as a pop icon has remained solid since she hit the scene in 1998.  But Britney, in the end, isn't just a product - she's a person.  Deprived of her humanity and sanity by false accusations, intrusive acts by the public and lenses, as well as a simple lack of understanding (which she points out quite beautifully in a previously unreleased segment when she is allowed to drive her Mercedes in the country), the blonde bombshell comes off as a sad, sedated person in Britney: For the Record, her most intimate and in-depth documentary yet.  To her critics who feel she hasn't answered enough about her behavior I say this: It's NONE of your business.  Britney may be an uber-celebrity, but she deserves some privacy and the right to be able to keep some secrets from the prying public eye, which most of us never have to deal with.  For the Record offers up a heartbreaking look into the life of one of the world's most famous persons, allowing the public to finally see the real person beneath the facades.",5,"Heartbreaking, touching & introspective",1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,1193,"['Britney', 'Spears', 'arguably', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'female', 'pop', 'star', 'ups', 'downs', 'have', 'provided', 'more', 'fire', 'tabloids', 'anyone', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'yet', 'success', 'pop', 'icon', 'remained', 'solid', 'hit', 'scene', '1998', 'Britney', 'end', ""n't"", 'just', 'product', 'person', 'Deprived', 'humanity', 'sanity', 'false', 'accusations', 'intrusive', 'acts', 'public', 'lenses', 'as', 'well', 'simple', 'lack', 'understanding', 'out', 'quite', 'beautifully', 'previously', 'unreleased', 'segment', 'when', 'allowed', 'drive', 'Mercedes', 'country', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'off', 'sad', 'sedated', 'person', 'Britney', 'Record', 'most', 'intimate', 'in-depth', 'documentary', 'yet', 'critics', 'who', 'feel', ""n't"", 'answered', 'enough', 'behavior', 'say', 'NONE', 'business', 'Britney', 'may', 'be', 'uber-celebrity', 'privacy', 'right', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'secrets', 'prying', 'public', 'eye', 'most', 'never', 'have', 'deal', 'Record', 'up', 'heartbreaking', 'look', 'life', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'persons', 'allowing', 'public', 'finally', 'see', 'real', 'person', 'facades']",Britney: For The Record

In her words, she isn't looking for pity, just a little understanding.Britney really is in great shape, back to her former self.

1235603,A2WRO6JWS5LQK8,B001T46TUG,STAN CHUN,"[1, 1]",I really liked this documentary on Britney.Usually there are a lot of confusing flashbacks which screen for a millisecond then flash to another old pic.The prime shot of Britney was taken in great lighting and very close up so that it was easier to read her impressions as well as listen to the down to earth narrative.The doco not only describes how hard it is to gain success but also how you can be strangled by the same 'success' and the expression of her having only a space 4 feet by 4 feet to feel free in is apt.This must apply to many of today's stars and they like Britney yearn for understanding and that life at the top can make you feel like you are being crushed.Stan ChunWellingtonNew Zealand,4,BRTNEY FOR THE RECORD,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,707,"['really', 'liked', 'documentary', 'Britney.Usually', 'are', 'lot', 'confusing', 'flashbacks', 'screen', 'millisecond', 'then', 'old', 'pic.The', 'prime', 'shot', 'Britney', 'was', 'taken', 'great', 'lighting', 'very', 'close', 'so', 'was', 'easier', 'read', 'impressions', 'as', 'well', 'listen', 'down', 'earth', 'narrative.The', 'doco', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'hard', 'gain', 'success', 'also', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'strangled', 'same', ""'success"", 'expression', 'having', 'only', 'space', '4', 'feet', '4', 'feet', 'feel', 'free', 'apt.This', 'must', 'apply', 'many', 'today', 'stars', 'like', 'Britney', 'yearn', 'understanding', 'life', 'top', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'are', 'being', 'crushed.Stan', 'ChunWellingtonNew', 'Zealand']",Britney: For The Record
1235604,A33BOYMVG3U58Y,B001T46TUG,TV Critic,"[41, 42]","When 'Britney: For the Record' premiered in the winter of 2008, the world got answers to one of the most infamous breakdowns in entertainment history.  Britney put herself out there and talked candidly about her tough years after her marriage broke-up, years that included shaving her head, stints in rehab, losing custody of her two sons, being drugged and taken advantage of by a manager who she thought had her best interest at heart and with two emergency trips to the psychiatric ward in the hospital, she finally got saved by her family who took the reigns and removed the bad influences from her life and helped her as she worked hard to rebuild the life that was torn apart.This is no ordinary documentary, it's not a fluff piece and it's not 'pity me, I'm rich and famous and don't like it' piece either.  It's simply Britney, up close and personal as she talks about what happened in the past and how she's looking forward to a brighter future.  As she geared up for what would become the greatest comeback in history, Britney assures fans that while she isn't 100% recovered from her hell years, she is definitely on her way and in a much better place than she was.This is a must have DVD for Britney fans and for entertainment fans in general.  It's important to see that while being rich and famous seems like it's euphoria, it comes with it, a lot of pain, stress and constant scrutiny.  It lets fans go past the tabloids and paparazzi and see the true Britney.",5,A Heartbreaking Account of What Fame Can Do to an Individual,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,1475,"['When', ""'Britney"", 'Record', 'premiered', 'winter', '2008', 'world', 'got', 'answers', 'one', 'most', 'infamous', 'breakdowns', 'entertainment', 'history', 'Britney', 'put', 'there', 'talked', 'candidly', 'tough', 'years', 'marriage', 'broke-up', 'years', 'included', 'shaving', 'head', 'stints', 'rehab', 'losing', 'custody', 'two', 'sons', 'being', 'drugged', 'taken', 'advantage', 'manager', 'who', 'thought', 'had', 'best', 'interest', 'heart', 'two', 'emergency', 'trips', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'hospital', 'finally', 'got', 'saved', 'family', 'who', 'took', 'reigns', 'removed', 'bad', 'influences', 'life', 'helped', 'worked', 'hard', 'rebuild', 'life', 'was', 'torn', 'apart.This', 'ordinary', 'documentary', 'not', 'fluff', 'piece', 'not', ""'pity"", ""'m"", 'rich', 'famous', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'piece', 'simply', 'Britney', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'what', 'happened', 'past', 'how', 'looking', 'forward', 'brighter', 'future', 'geared', 'up', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'greatest', 'comeback', 'history', 'Britney', 'fans', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'recovered', 'hell', 'years', 'definitely', 'way', 'much', 'better', 'place', 'must', 'have', 'DVD', 'Britney', 'fans', 'entertainment', 'fans', 'general', 'important', 'see', 'being', 'rich', 'famous', 'euphoria', 'lot', 'pain', 'stress', 'constant', 'scrutiny', 'fans', 'go', 'tabloids', 'paparazzi', 'see', 'true', 'Britney']",Britney: For The Record

Her antics weren't just spread all over EVERY magazine cover, but even make it to the national nightly news!  You also don't have to be a genius to figure out that half the stuff in those magazines didn't seem quite right, though.  Finally Britney shows us a little look into what it's like to be the worlds most famous celebrity.  Some critics say that it doesn't really explain everything (Why exactly did she shave her head?? How did this guy take control of her life?) she touches on most of the highlights, but the poor girl's life is public enough - can we at least allow her to keep SOME secrets to herself?You're probably a Britney fan if you're looking at this so I doubt I have to convince you that her music is awesome.
