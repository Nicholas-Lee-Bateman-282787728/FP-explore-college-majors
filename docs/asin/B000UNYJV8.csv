1095457,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000UNYJV8,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","In a beautifully honest look at the intimate enticement of Nazi comradeship, `This is England' tells the true story of young twelve year old Shaun; an impressionable `fatherless boy' being raised by his mother in 1980's England.  Shaun is a pudgy, oft teased young boy who craves the attention his deceased father cannot give him.  In the film's opening scenes we see this young kid thrash out at those who verbally aggravate him with a faux sense of confidence.Inside, Shaun is living in loneliness.That is, until he meets Woody.  Woody and his friends are a certain breed of skinhead; nothing too abrasive but more embracive of their new young friend.  Shaun is instantly drawn to the idea of friends and the thought that he could have something special and form bonds with these young people.  Woody takes young Shaun under his wing, and all is good and swell until Woody's friend Combo is released from prison.  Combo is abrasive and aggressive and hypnotically manipulative.  He comes home with a ravenous new agenda, one corrupted by racism and a neo-political viewpoint.  This permeates his every word, seething from his lips with an estranging quality.  Instead of being repulsed, like Woody and his friends (which include Milky, who is black), young Shaun is entranced.  Praying on his innate need to please his dead father, Shaun firmly believes that Combo can bring him closer to an intimate understanding of his father, but Combo doesn't even understand his own beliefs.  Combo is just as confused as everyone else, hanging firmly to a conviction he doesn't quite understand.  As their relationship grows, Combo and Shaun both begin to see a clearer reality that explodes in a sequence that is emotionally unsettling yet ultimately inevitable.With a sharp eye for realism, director/writer Shane Meadows uses his own life lessons to script a film that bleeds with a sense of purpose.  Every frame rests comfortably in an air of discomfort, using the awkward layers of honesty to flesh out a very raw and believable depiction of the devastatingly mental, emotional and physical effects of hatred and misplaced loyalties.Shane's brilliant direction is accompanied by a stellar ensemble that truly understands every nuance of emotional complexity within their relatable characters.  Young Thomas Turgoose gives a marvelous performance as Shaun.  The way he absorbs the charismatic presence of his cohorts is intensely believable.  You can see the little boy trying to fake being a `big man' in order to fit in with a crowd he doesn't fully understand.  Better yet is Stephen Graham.  His electrifying performance as Combo is breathtaking.  The way he gets the little things (fully fleshing out Combo's own naivety within his sharp outbursts and manipulated convictions is fantastic) just helps layer his every moment on screen.This man isn't evil, he's just confused.In the end, `This is England' is a powerful statement piece that plays out like so much more.  It is an intimate drama that unfolds like a personal love story to adolescence, a time of mistakes and misfortunes by most of all, a time of growing up, wising up and eventually becoming a man; your own man.",5,This is film!,1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,3177,"['beautifully', 'honest', 'look', 'intimate', 'enticement', 'Nazi', 'comradeship', 'England', 'true', 'story', 'young', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'Shaun', 'impressionable', 'fatherless', 'boy', 'being', 'raised', 'mother', '1980', 'England', 'Shaun', 'pudgy', 'oft', 'teased', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'attention', 'deceased', 'father', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'film', 'opening', 'see', 'young', 'kid', 'out', 'who', 'verbally', 'aggravate', 'faux', 'sense', 'confidence.Inside', 'Shaun', 'living', 'Woody', 'Woody', 'friends', 'are', 'certain', 'breed', 'skinhead', 'nothing', 'too', 'abrasive', 'more', 'embracive', 'new', 'young', 'friend', 'Shaun', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'idea', 'friends', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'something', 'special', 'form', 'bonds', 'young', 'people', 'Woody', 'young', 'Shaun', 'wing', 'good', 'swell', 'Woody', 'friend', 'Combo', 'released', 'prison', 'Combo', 'abrasive', 'aggressive', 'hypnotically', 'manipulative', 'home', 'ravenous', 'new', 'agenda', 'one', 'corrupted', 'racism', 'neo-political', 'viewpoint', 'word', 'seething', 'lips', 'estranging', 'quality', 'Instead', 'being', 'repulsed', 'Woody', 'friends', 'include', 'Milky', 'who', 'black', 'young', 'Shaun', 'entranced', 'Praying', 'innate', 'need', 'please', 'dead', 'father', 'Shaun', 'firmly', 'Combo', 'can', 'bring', 'closer', 'intimate', 'understanding', 'father', 'Combo', ""n't"", 'even', 'understand', 'own', 'beliefs', 'Combo', 'just', 'as', 'confused', 'everyone', 'else', 'hanging', 'firmly', 'conviction', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'relationship', 'grows', 'Combo', 'Shaun', 'begin', 'see', 'clearer', 'reality', 'sequence', 'emotionally', 'unsettling', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'inevitable.With', 'sharp', 'eye', 'realism', 'director/writer', 'Shane', 'Meadows', 'own', 'life', 'lessons', 'script', 'film', 'sense', 'purpose', 'frame', 'comfortably', 'air', 'discomfort', 'using', 'awkward', 'layers', 'honesty', 'flesh', 'out', 'very', 'raw', 'believable', 'depiction', 'devastatingly', 'mental', 'emotional', 'physical', 'effects', 'hatred', 'misplaced', 'loyalties.Shane', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'accompanied', 'stellar', 'ensemble', 'truly', 'nuance', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'relatable', 'characters', 'Young', 'Thomas', 'Turgoose', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'Shaun', 'way', 'charismatic', 'presence', 'cohorts', 'intensely', 'believable', 'can', 'see', 'little', 'boy', 'trying', 'fake', 'being', 'big', 'man', 'order', 'fit', 'crowd', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'Better', 'yet', 'Stephen', 'Graham', 'electrifying', 'performance', 'Combo', 'breathtaking', 'way', 'little', 'things', 'fully', 'fleshing', 'out', 'Combo', 'own', 'naivety', 'sharp', 'outbursts', 'manipulated', 'convictions', 'fantastic', 'just', 'layer', 'moment', 'screen.This', 'man', ""n't"", 'evil', 'just', 'confused.In', 'end', 'England', 'powerful', 'statement', 'piece', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'intimate', 'drama', 'personal', 'love', 'story', 'adolescence', 'time', 'mistakes', 'misfortunes', 'most', 'time', 'growing', 'up', 'wising', 'up', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'man', 'own', 'man']",This is England

It tells the story of a young boy who joins a group of skinheads. The split from Trojan (Traditional Skins) to Rascist/Far Right Skins is shown here with Combo. It does very good to show the Skin Culture in a movie (the director was a Skin in his youth and it's pretty autobiographical). It is a great coming of age tale, a great Skin movie, it  also examines how hatred can spread through manipulative people and how through reason good will rise in the end. Be warned this movie is quite an emotional experience and the ending is cathartic.All the music is great (Toots and The Maytals, Percy Sledge, The Specials, U.K. Subs, the Piano themes by  Ludovico Einaudi, Et cetera) in short  it's all good.As for extras there is an essay on skins, a making of feature, and the deleted scenes (including the alternative ending)10/10 movie I would highly recommend it to those who keep the spirit of '69 Alive  and those who aren't skins at all.

The concept of what a traditional skinhead is vs. a neo-nazi, and when the traditional skinhead movement turned into a political mess during the 1980's, and the Falklands being only a part of what caused a lot of the political chaos amongst the working class, the patriots, and the youth.The story is told through the life of a young fatherless boy who lost his father in the Falklands war that befriends a group of traditional skinheads. He is tired of being picked on, and he's tired of being bullied. He's a loner, and the traditional skinhead group he meets become part of his family. When the group encounters Gumbo, a former member of the group, it's a world that the young boy never imagined, and a divide occurs between the traditional skinhead gang and Gumbo's National Front inspired movement.I have to say that I found the story to be a little bit more realistic than ""American History X,"" and a little bit more educational. The soundtrack to this film is also very fitting, and the soundtrack of traditional ska and northern soul music is wonderful.

1095461,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B000UNYJV8,Dai-keag-ity,"[5, 9]","This is England came to me highly recommended as a smart, insightful film that told a story of modern history that I agree is worth telling. The problem is, I am left clueless as to what this movie was about. It didn't quite work as political commentary, as history, as a coming of age tale, as a story of the aftermath of grieving and loss, or as a buddy film. Its gaping ramblings about skinhead culture, race relations and changing times during Thatcher's ""reign"" needed more focus and a better script. I think too much was ambitiously aimed at by the makers of This is England, and as a result, what could have been an entertaining tale with a sound message ended up being a scattered, drifting, inexplicably stuttering exercise in missed opportunity. What was worth sticking around for were the performances here by some talented actors, young Thomas Turgoose as the emotionally needy central character, and the charismatic Stephan Graham most of all. Graham's sympathetic lost soul skinhead character, Combo, was in equal parts endearing, repulsive, and fascinating, and if this movie had a saving grace it was to be found in him. Other characters were maddeningly underused, namely Joseph Gilgun's Woody, who seemed poised to be the film's protagonist, but vanished as the plot grew toward its mid-point. This is England is in part inspired by real people and events in its director, Shane Meadow's, life, and I'm sure had much personal meaning to him, but it was still a sadly empty motion picture that did not live up to its billing.",3,"Too Timid To Make A Point, Too Scattered To Tell A Firm Story",1230076800,"12 24, 2008",2008,1542,"['England', 'came', 'highly', 'recommended', 'smart', 'insightful', 'film', 'told', 'story', 'modern', 'history', 'agree', 'worth', 'telling', 'problem', 'am', 'left', 'clueless', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'as', 'political', 'commentary', 'history', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'story', 'aftermath', 'grieving', 'loss', 'buddy', 'film', 'gaping', 'ramblings', 'skinhead', 'culture', 'race', 'relations', 'changing', 'times', 'Thatcher', 'reign', 'needed', 'more', 'focus', 'better', 'script', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'ambitiously', 'aimed', 'makers', 'England', 'result', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'entertaining', 'tale', 'sound', 'message', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'scattered', 'drifting', 'inexplicably', 'stuttering', 'exercise', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'What', 'was', 'worth', 'sticking', 'were', 'performances', 'here', 'talented', 'actors', 'young', 'Thomas', 'Turgoose', 'emotionally', 'needy', 'central', 'character', 'charismatic', 'Stephan', 'Graham', 'most', 'Graham', 'sympathetic', 'lost', 'soul', 'skinhead', 'character', 'Combo', 'was', 'equal', 'parts', 'endearing', 'repulsive', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'had', 'saving', 'grace', 'was', 'be', 'found', 'Other', 'characters', 'were', 'maddeningly', 'underused', 'namely', 'Joseph', 'Gilgun', 'Woody', 'who', 'seemed', 'poised', 'be', 'film', 'protagonist', 'vanished', 'plot', 'grew', 'mid-point', 'England', 'part', 'inspired', 'real', 'people', 'events', 'director', 'Shane', 'Meadow', 'life', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'much', 'personal', 'meaning', 'was', 'still', 'sadly', 'empty', 'motion', 'picture', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'billing']",This is England
1095462,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B000UNYJV8,D. Hartley,"[4, 5]","A hard-hitting, naturalistic ""social drama"" reminiscent of the work of Ken Loach and British ""angry young man"" films of the early 60s (with a slight whiff of ""A Clockwork Orange"") ""This is England"" is set against the backdrop of the Thatcher era, circa 1983. The story (reported to be loosely auto-biographical, based on the director's Midlands upbringing) centers around a glum, alienated 12 year-old named Shaun (first-time film actor Thomas Turgoose, in an extraordinary performance) who can't seem to fit in with any of the cliques at his school. Shaun presents a real handful to his loving but somewhat exasperated mother (Jo Hartley),a working-class Falklands War widow who does her best to support herself and her son. After a particularly bad day of being bullied about by teachers and schoolmates, happenstance leads Shaun into the midst of a skinhead gang.Shaun's initial apprehension is quickly washed away when the sympathetic and good-natured gang leader Woody (Joe Gilgun) takes him under his wing and offers him an unconditional entr&eacute;e into their little club. Shaun's weary working mum is initially not so crazy about his new pals, but after sizing them up decides essentially to leave her son in their care. Some may feel that this development strains credibility, but I think it's a pragmatic decision. Her son has no siblings, no close friends,and is suffering from the loss of his father; perhaps this surrogate family will give him what she cannot provide.The idyll is soon shattered, however, when the gang's original leader, Combo (Stephen Graham) is released from prison. Combo's return causes a rift that divides the gang; his jailhouse conversion to racist National Front ideals doesn't settle well with Woody and his supporters, and they break off on their own. Shaun decides to stay on after forming an instant bond with the thuggish Combo, who easily parlays the impressionable Shaun's grief over his father into a blame-shifting hatred of immigrants, with tragic results.The film works successfully on several levels; as a cautionary tale, a history lesson and a riveting drama. As cautionary tale, it demonstrates how easily the neglected and disenfranchised can be recruited and indoctrinated into the politics of hate. As a history lesson, it's a fascinating glimpse at a not-so-long ago era of complex politics and social upheaval in Great Britain. As a riveting drama, it features some very believable and astounding performances, particularly from the aforementioned young Turgoose and Graham, who positively owns the screen with his charismatic intensity.

1095465,A2ONZPPQ93TPQ9,B000UNYJV8,Gena Chereck,"[1, 1]","This Is England, the fifth feature film by Shane Meadows (whose debut feature was the 1998 boxing drama Twentyfour Seven), is set in the summer of 1983 and concerns an 11-year-old boy named Shaun (played by newcomer Thomas Turgoose) whose father has recently been killed in the Falkland Islands war. In the course of the story, the boy grows up mighty fast as he falls in with a couple of gangs.First, lonely Shaun is befriended by a fun-loving bunch of skinheads led by the affable Woody (Joe Gilgun). Woody and his mates are a likable and fairly harmless lot, and their scenes together are quite entertaining. But the party doesn't last forever: Soon a rift forms in the group when their old friend Combo (Stephen Graham) returns from a stint in prison transformed into a nationalistic neo-Nazi, and Shaun chooses to side with his seething posse.In the hands of lesser talents, Combo might have been portrayed as a one-dimensional racist monster, and it would be a total mystery as to why Shaun would be drawn to him. But it's a credit to both actor Graham and screenwriter Meadows that there's so much more to the character: Combo is handsome and charismatic, he sympathizes with the fatherless Shaun, and though cursed with a frightening, hair-trigger temper, he also shows vulnerability; furthermore, even if you don't approve of his rants or how he terrorizes the local Pakistani immigrants, at least you can sense the frustration and fear behind his words and deeds. Indeed, the entire cast is uniformly strong; Turgoose, Gilgun, and Graham are the dominant figures here, but the many fine supporting players include Jo Hartley as Shaun's caring mother, Andrew Shim as Woody's Afro-Jamaican pal Milky, and Vicky McClure as Combo's former girlfriend Lol.I must note that, while TIE is an undeniably personal story for Meadows (it was mostly inspired by incidents from the British writer-director's own childhood), you don't have to be a Brit who grew up in the '80s to appreciate it; for one thing, the notion of the gang-as-surrogate-family is timeless and universal. Also, when Combo rages about unemployment, cheap immigrant labor, a ""fake war,"" and needing to ""fight"" to take back his country, it hits uncomfortably close to home.

1095466,A1F2IPYSXB0ZCX,B000UNYJV8,Ian Phillips,"[0, 0]","This Is England is most definitely one of the very best British films of the twenty-first century and ranking as Shane Meadows most outstanding to date. Meadows draws on his own personal experiences as a skin head during the early 1980's. This Is England is set during the summer months of 1983 at the time of ""Thatcher's Britain"" and indeed the era of the skinheads, punk, racism and facism.Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) is a lonely 11 year old kid growing up on a rough council estate in the North Of England. He is grieving the sudden loss of his father after he was killed in the horrific Falklands War. Encountering incessant bullying at school, Shaun meets a gang of friendly, multi-racial, dope-smoking skin heads, headed by Woody (Joseph Gilgunn) who immediately are drawn to his sadness and confusion and subsequently take the boy under their wing. However when one of the gang's old members Combo, (Stephen Graham) a vicious, racist thug and bully, is released from prison, Shaun is manipulated by Combo's way of thinking and racist attitude and turns into a thug himself, convinced he would be making his late Dad proud. After Combo brutally beats up Shaun's friend Milky (Andrew Shim) and exposes his own deep vulnreability and unbalanced mental state, Shaun comes back down to earth (and his senses), realising the lifestyle he'd been leading was not really for him, nor would it have made his Dad proud.Though the first half of This Is England is touchingly funny, drawing on the allure and fun of being in a gang, the second half soon makes way for a much darker, raw and gritty nature, with many violent episodes and highlighting the brutally stark racism that existed at the time (and still does unfortunately!). Shane Meadows shrewdly evokes the total working-class despair of ""Thatcher's Britain"", capturing the era impeccably well and impressively authentic in detail.Like every other of Shane Meadows absolutely superb films, the acting and dialogue is astutely naturalistic, drawing you in from the opening scene. Most outstanding of all is the immensely talented youngster Thomas Turgoose who's almost stark performance never once shrinks from being anything but utterly powerful and beleavable. Indeed the cast are all thoroughly excellent that includes another notably powerful turn from the ever-brilliant Stephen Graham as Combo; Joseph Gilgunn as the loveable, kindly rogue Woody who is the leader of the gang that Shaun first joins and who also refuses to be brainwashed by Combo's unhinged way of thinking and racial hatred; Jo Hartley as Shaun's mum Cynth who upon meeting the gang headed by Woody becomes charmed by them herself it seems, after having had serious reservations when first seeing her young son with a shaved head; Andrew Shim as the friendly Milky; Vicky McClure as the more sensible, level-headed Lol and Rosamund Hanson as the eccentric but likeable Smell.Extra features on this DVD edition is endearing audio commentary to the film by writer and director Shane Meadows, producer Mark Herbert and the greatly talented young lead actor Thomas Turgoose.Truly an out and out masterpiece, This Is England is an often funny, often shocking and often deeply moving portrait of a moment in British cultural history.Ian PhillipsApril 2010",5,Shane Meadows Very Best Film To Date,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,3273,"['England', 'most', 'definitely', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'British', 'films', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'ranking', 'Shane', 'Meadows', 'most', 'outstanding', 'date', 'Meadows', 'own', 'personal', 'experiences', 'skin', 'head', 'early', '1980', 'England', 'set', 'summer', 'months', '1983', 'time', 'Thatcher', 'Britain', 'indeed', 'era', 'skinheads', 'punk', 'racism', 'facism.Shaun', 'Thomas', 'Turgoose', 'lonely', '11', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', 'rough', 'council', 'estate', 'North', 'England', 'grieving', 'sudden', 'loss', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'horrific', 'Falklands', 'War', 'Encountering', 'incessant', 'bullying', 'school', 'Shaun', 'gang', 'friendly', 'multi-racial', 'dope-smoking', 'skin', 'heads', 'headed', 'Woody', 'Joseph', 'Gilgunn', 'who', 'immediately', 'are', 'drawn', 'sadness', 'confusion', 'subsequently', 'take', 'boy', 'wing', 'However', 'when', 'one', 'gang', 'old', 'members', 'Combo', 'Stephen', 'Graham', 'vicious', 'racist', 'thug', 'bully', 'released', 'prison', 'Shaun', 'manipulated', 'Combo', 'way', 'thinking', 'racist', 'attitude', 'thug', 'convinced', 'would', 'be', 'making', 'late', 'Dad', 'proud', 'Combo', 'brutally', 'up', 'Shaun', 'friend', 'Milky', 'Andrew', 'Shim', 'own', 'deep', 'vulnreability', 'unbalanced', 'mental', 'state', 'Shaun', 'back', 'down', 'earth', 'senses', 'realising', 'lifestyle', ""'d"", 'been', 'leading', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Dad', 'first', 'half', 'Is', 'England', 'touchingly', 'funny', 'drawing', 'allure', 'fun', 'being', 'gang', 'second', 'half', 'soon', 'way', 'much', 'darker', 'raw', 'gritty', 'nature', 'many', 'violent', 'episodes', 'highlighting', 'brutally', 'stark', 'racism', 'existed', 'time', 'still', 'unfortunately', 'Shane', 'Meadows', 'shrewdly', 'total', 'working-class', 'despair', 'Thatcher', 'Britain', 'capturing', 'era', 'impeccably', 'well', 'impressively', 'authentic', 'detail.Like', 'other', 'Shane', 'Meadows', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'films', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'astutely', 'naturalistic', 'drawing', 'opening', 'scene', 'Most', 'outstanding', 'immensely', 'talented', 'youngster', 'Thomas', 'Turgoose', 'who', 'almost', 'stark', 'performance', 'never', 'once', 'shrinks', 'being', 'anything', 'utterly', 'powerful', 'beleavable', 'Indeed', 'cast', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'excellent', 'notably', 'powerful', 'turn', 'ever-brilliant', 'Stephen', 'Graham', 'Combo', 'Joseph', 'Gilgunn', 'loveable', 'kindly', 'rogue', 'Woody', 'who', 'leader', 'gang', 'Shaun', 'first', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'brainwashed', 'Combo', 'unhinged', 'way', 'thinking', 'racial', 'hatred', 'Jo', 'Hartley', 'Shaun', 'mum', 'Cynth', 'who', 'meeting', 'gang', 'headed', 'Woody', 'becomes', 'charmed', 'having', 'had', 'serious', 'reservations', 'when', 'first', 'seeing', 'young', 'son', 'shaved', 'head', 'Andrew', 'Shim', 'friendly', 'Milky', 'Vicky', 'McClure', 'more', 'sensible', 'level-headed', 'Lol', 'Rosamund', 'Hanson', 'eccentric', 'likeable', 'Smell.Extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'edition', 'endearing', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'writer', 'director', 'Shane', 'Meadows', 'producer', 'Mark', 'Herbert', 'greatly', 'talented', 'young', 'lead', 'actor', 'Thomas', 'Turgoose.Truly', 'out', 'masterpiece', 'Is', 'England', 'often', 'funny', 'often', 'shocking', 'often', 'deeply', 'moving', 'portrait', 'moment', 'British', 'cultural', 'history.Ian', 'PhillipsApril', '2010']",This is England

Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) is a defiant and cocksure 12-year-old who recently lost his father in the Falklands War. Surrounded by unemployment, malaise, and picked on at school, he finds companionship and an outlet for his frustrations among a group of skinheads whose leader, Woody (Joe Gilgun), takes the boy under his wing. This seems harmless until violent, insecure Combo (Stephen Graham) rejoins his fellow skins after a 3-year stint in prison, shattering the group's camaraderie with racism and crime.""This Is England"" dives into the skinhead counterculture that gave working-class young people a place to belong and share their dissatisfaction. Unemployment and a poor economy made them susceptible to the inflammatory rhetoric of the National Front, causing skinheads to be associated with racism and violence in the popular consciousness. The two stand-out performances are, not surprisingly, the most emotionally charged characters. Thomas Turgoose is completely natural as a foul-mouthed, moody youngster -who looks closer to 9 than 12. Stephen Graham makes Combo's instability and insecurity menacing, always in danger of erupting. I found the poor quality DV out of place in the period setting and less than this film deserves.

All of the kids are tough troublemakers who get the kid, Shaun, involved in activities that no twelve year old should be involved in, but they are depicted as mainly a good group of kids, who don't have much besides each other and so really care about each other.  They are into music and drinking and the occasional ""spliff"" but aren't haters and don't like violence.  That is, until  the return of an old friend who spent three years in prison and acquired a violent and totalitarian and racist streak, and tries to recruit the ""gang"" for his own ""political"" activities.  Shaun, who is apparently based on the director's own past, has to make a choice, and the film is about how that choice will profoundly affect his young life.  The film also draws an ironic connection between the colonialist activities of England overseas and the xenophobic and nationalistic tendencies of the homegrown skinheads.  The music is perfect, and the film should be seen for the soundtrack alone; the filmmakers do a nice job tying the story to documentary footage from the era and seem to have created a spot on characterization of the period; the film is hard to watch, especially because everything that happens is happening to or is directly participated in by a twelve year old boy; and the language, while presumably authentic, is extremely harsh (both in the sense of its extraordinarily prolific usage of a word that begins with f, and in the sense of being hard for at least these ears to discern fully due to the heaviness of the regional accents).  Still, if you like your films to open you up to a different world, and to be honest in their depiction of that world whether it is comfortable or not, and if you appreciate thoughtful filmmakers who take risks and who push in small ways the envelope of commercial filmmaking, then this is definitely one to watch.",4,The coming of age of a skinhead in post-Thatcher England,1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,2034,"['England', 'riveting', 'story', 'lonely', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'lost', 'father', 'Falkland', 'War', 'who', 'group', 'young', 'skinheads', 'kicks', 'friendship', 'kids', 'are', 'tough', 'troublemakers', 'who', 'get', 'kid', 'Shaun', 'involved', 'activities', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'should', 'be', 'involved', 'are', 'depicted', 'mainly', 'good', 'group', 'kids', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'other', 'so', 'really', 'care', 'other', 'are', 'music', 'drinking', 'occasional', 'spliff', 'are', ""n't"", 'haters', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'violence', 'return', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'spent', 'three', 'years', 'prison', 'acquired', 'violent', 'totalitarian', 'racist', 'streak', 'tries', 'recruit', 'gang', 'own', 'political', 'activities', 'Shaun', 'who', 'apparently', 'based', 'director', 'own', 'past', 'make', 'choice', 'film', 'how', 'choice', 'will', 'profoundly', 'affect', 'young', 'life', 'film', 'also', 'ironic', 'connection', 'colonialist', 'activities', 'England', 'overseas', 'xenophobic', 'nationalistic', 'tendencies', 'homegrown', 'skinheads', 'music', 'perfect', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'soundtrack', 'alone', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'tying', 'story', 'documentary', 'footage', 'era', 'seem', 'have', 'created', 'spot', 'characterization', 'period', 'film', 'hard', 'watch', 'especially', 'everything', 'happening', 'directly', 'participated', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'language', 'presumably', 'authentic', 'extremely', 'harsh', 'sense', 'extraordinarily', 'prolific', 'usage', 'word', 'f', 'sense', 'being', 'hard', 'least', 'ears', 'discern', 'fully', 'due', 'heaviness', 'regional', 'accents', 'Still', 'like', 'films', 'open', 'up', 'different', 'world', 'be', 'honest', 'depiction', 'world', 'comfortable', 'not', 'appreciate', 'thoughtful', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'take', 'risks', 'who', 'push', 'small', 'ways', 'envelope', 'commercial', 'filmmaking', 'then', 'definitely', 'one', 'watch']",This is England

Sprinkle in the classic coming-of-age story with the evil-guy-outta-jail-comes-back theme and the film is absorbed so easily, save for the brutality of the story.  Very watchable, highly entertaining, if possibly the slightest bit cliche (but if you aren't familiar with Toots & The Maytals or Fred Perry shirts then nix that comment.)  It's funny to see Americans getting upset because they can't relate.  This story, though thoroughly English (thus the title) really has enough universality to not let the ""funny accents"" be a stumbling block.

An honest, powerful and genuinely realistic story about the beginings of the skinhead movement in England. I was amazed by this movie, simply amazed. The directing is some of the best I have seen in recent memory. The acting is some of the best I have seen in a very long time. This film is slow moving, but It's not a film that relies on action or brutality to tell it's story. It's a movie that has a real sense of realism, right down to the music, which clearly was particularly treated with special care. There are some underground songs in this film that I was very suprised to hear. Such as Strawberry Switchblade's 'Since Yesterday', and a very moving cover of The Smiths ""Please Please, Please- let me get what I want"" among other music tracks that add to the very realistic feel of this film. This film is certainly the most realistic rendering of the true skinhead movement. It has moments that will remind you of films like Romper Stomper and American History X. And while not nearly as violent as either, you'll come out of this feeling that you've seen an honest portrait of the skinhead movement. I can't say enough good things about this movie.

Turns out, the original or 'Traditional' skinheads in Great Britain were a multi-racial bunch. Reggae was even one of their primary choices of music.Shaun (Tomo Turgoose) is going through a tough period in his life. He just lost his Dad in the Falklands War, and he's understandably not doing too well. Unfortunately, a wardrobe malfunction makes him the target of a group of kids needing someone to pick on.Shaun finds friendship and respect in a skinhead gang. At the time, the gang's led by Jamaican, Woody. Later, the original leader of the gang Combo returns from prison and he's gained a whole new racist agenda there.Still, Woody is welcome and even a Black member can join, because Combo sees his agenda as anti-Pakistani.""This is England"" covers a lot of painful and controversial territory:  student bullying, gangs, racism, war.  It's not an easy watch--but a good one.I think the characterization is some of the best I have seen in British films.  Shaun, Woody, even Combo come alive on the screen.

1095480,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000UNYJV8,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","Superbly written and directed by Shane Meadows, ""This is England"" provides us with an unflinchingly realistic and grimly depressing look at the skinhead subculture of early 1980's Britain.Shaun is a twelve-year-old lad who has recently lost his father in the Falklands War.  Even though Shaun has learned to give as good as he gets when the schoolyard and neighborhood bullies go to whaling on him (both verbally and physically), that still doesn't keep him from being ridiculed and harassed on an almost daily basis by kids who are bigger than he is - until, that is, he hooks up with a gang of social delinquents who take him under their wing, drastically altering his appearance and bringing him along on orgies of destruction as part of his initiation.Although ""This is England"" is harrowing in what it says about a generation caught in an out-of-control spiral of purposelessness, rebelliousness and violence, there is a surprising amount of humor and tenderness in the film as well.  Shaun may be mouthy and obnoxious a good part of the time, but he also possesses a whip-smart sense of humor, a strong instinct for self-preservation, and a wise-beyond-his-years perceptiveness about how life on the street actually works.  In a similar way, even the punks who befriend and corrupt the boy are portrayed as complex, three-dimensional individuals, their occasional displays of charm and decency going a long way towards explaining just why it is that Shaun and even his own well-meaning mother are so easily taken in by them.The real trouble begins when Combo, a neighborhood troublemaker and now radical ""England for the English"" nationalist, is released from prison and proceeds to infect the group with the idea of ""taking back"" the country from the hordes of dark-skinned ""Pakis"" who have increasingly made their home there.  A gifted rabble rouser, Combo not only exploits working class dissatisfaction with the economy and the war, but appeals to out-and-out racism and xenophobia to win the men over to his side.  This proves too much for a number of the gang's members - including Woody, the nominal leader - who quietly bow out of the scene, but Shaun, still feeling sorely the absense of his father, continues to find a home with the group.The thing that is most striking about ""This is England"" is how remarkably fleshed-out and true-to-life the characters are, a result stemming as much from Meadows' thoughtful and intelligent screenplay as from the brilliant performances by Thomas Turgoose and Stephen Graham as Shaun and Combo, respectively.  Turgoose has an astonishing ability to be both childlike and strangely adult at one and the same time, while Graham keeps us on edge throughout with his volatile combination of charm, charisma, love of violence and hair-triggered temper.  And there are numerous other first-rate performances in the film as well.Even though the story, in this case, is played out against the backdrop of bellicose speeches by Margaret Thatcher and file footage of the Falklands War, the themes the movie deals with - the irrational fear of ""the other,"" the radicalization of disaffected youth, the seductive nature of the mob mentality - are sadly universal and relevant to all times and societies.  It is an eye-opening, cautionary tale about where modern society may be heading if we don't learn to see beneath the superficial differences of skin and culture and find the common ground of humanity that unites us all.  It's an old message but one that is delivered with unforgettable force in this film.",5,an unforgettable look at violent youth,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,3552,"['Superbly', 'written', 'directed', 'Shane', 'Meadows', 'England', 'unflinchingly', 'realistic', 'grimly', 'depressing', 'look', 'skinhead', 'subculture', 'early', '1980', 'Britain.Shaun', 'twelve-year-old', 'lad', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'father', 'Falklands', 'War', 'Even', 'Shaun', 'learned', 'give', 'as', 'good', 'when', 'schoolyard', 'neighborhood', 'bullies', 'go', 'whaling', 'verbally', 'physically', 'still', ""n't"", 'keep', 'being', 'ridiculed', 'harassed', 'almost', 'daily', 'basis', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'bigger', 'up', 'gang', 'social', 'delinquents', 'who', 'take', 'wing', 'drastically', 'altering', 'appearance', 'bringing', 'along', 'orgies', 'destruction', 'part', 'initiation.Although', 'England', 'harrowing', 'what', 'generation', 'caught', 'out-of-control', 'spiral', 'purposelessness', 'rebelliousness', 'violence', 'surprising', 'amount', 'humor', 'tenderness', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Shaun', 'may', 'be', 'mouthy', 'obnoxious', 'good', 'part', 'time', 'also', 'whip-smart', 'sense', 'humor', 'strong', 'instinct', 'self-preservation', 'wise-beyond-his-years', 'perceptiveness', 'how', 'life', 'street', 'actually', 'similar', 'way', 'even', 'punks', 'who', 'befriend', 'corrupt', 'boy', 'are', 'portrayed', 'complex', 'three-dimensional', 'individuals', 'occasional', 'displays', 'charm', 'decency', 'going', 'long', 'way', 'explaining', 'just', 'why', 'Shaun', 'even', 'own', 'well-meaning', 'mother', 'are', 'so', 'easily', 'taken', 'them.The', 'real', 'trouble', 'when', 'Combo', 'neighborhood', 'troublemaker', 'now', 'radical', 'England', 'English', 'nationalist', 'released', 'prison', 'proceeds', 'infect', 'group', 'idea', 'taking', 'back', 'country', 'hordes', 'dark-skinned', 'Pakis', 'who', 'have', 'increasingly', 'made', 'home', 'there', 'gifted', 'rabble', 'rouser', 'Combo', 'not', 'only', 'working', 'class', 'dissatisfaction', 'economy', 'war', 'appeals', 'out-and-out', 'racism', 'xenophobia', 'win', 'men', 'side', 'too', 'much', 'number', 'gang', 'members', 'including', 'Woody', 'nominal', 'leader', 'who', 'quietly', 'scene', 'Shaun', 'still', 'feeling', 'sorely', 'absense', 'father', 'find', 'home', 'group.The', 'thing', 'most', 'striking', 'England', 'how', 'remarkably', 'fleshed-out', 'true-to-life', 'characters', 'are', 'result', 'stemming', 'as', 'much', 'Meadows', 'thoughtful', 'intelligent', 'screenplay', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Thomas', 'Turgoose', 'Stephen', 'Graham', 'Shaun', 'Combo', 'respectively', 'Turgoose', 'astonishing', 'ability', 'be', 'childlike', 'strangely', 'adult', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'Graham', 'edge', 'volatile', 'combination', 'charm', 'charisma', 'love', 'violence', 'hair-triggered', 'temper', 'are', 'numerous', 'other', 'first-rate', 'performances', 'film', 'well.Even', 'story', 'case', 'played', 'out', 'backdrop', 'bellicose', 'speeches', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'file', 'footage', 'Falklands', 'War', 'themes', 'movie', 'deals', 'irrational', 'fear', 'other', 'radicalization', 'disaffected', 'youth', 'seductive', 'nature', 'mob', 'mentality', 'are', 'sadly', 'universal', 'relevant', 'times', 'societies', 'eye-opening', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'where', 'modern', 'society', 'may', 'be', 'heading', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'see', 'superficial', 'differences', 'skin', 'culture', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'humanity', 'old', 'message', 'one', 'delivered', 'unforgettable', 'force', 'film']",This is England
