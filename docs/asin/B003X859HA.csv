This is a well done portrait of the competitors of the Van Cliburn Competition and the intense pressure it takes to be chosen as a Medalist.

Allen,"[3, 3]","We are told that ""we entertain angels unaware""... well, in Nobuyuki, we are entertained by a young pianist from Japan who exudes all those qualities that make us feel good about life. I think Nobu's persona and playing would cause any serious viewer to wonder if God was not doing one of those rare, special 'things' in His world through this very lovable young and blind man!I have been following this wonderful competition for many years and have the other DVD's and tapes.  The quality and level of pianistic virtuosity displayed in the 13th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition surpasses all previous ones in my humble opinion.  Ran Dant and all 6 finalists were stunning and spectacular and you just wanted all of them to win the Gold.  Mariangelina Vocatello was my favorite, next to Nobu, but then watching and hearing Yeol Eum Som conquer the formidable Prokofiev 2nd is unbelievable also.  If you really love and appreciate piano played at its absolute finest, this dvd is for you.  Yes, I too would have liked more piano time but the human interest stories here were too good to neglect and anyway, you can go to Cliburn.tv webcast of ALL the performances that still can be seen and heard at that website.",5,Just what this world needs a great deal  more of....,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,1222,"['are', 'told', 'entertain', 'angels', 'unaware', 'well', 'Nobuyuki', 'are', 'entertained', 'young', 'pianist', 'Japan', 'who', 'exudes', 'qualities', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'life', 'think', 'Nobu', 'persona', 'playing', 'would', 'cause', 'serious', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'God', 'was', 'not', 'doing', 'one', 'rare', 'special', ""'things"", 'world', 'very', 'lovable', 'young', 'blind', 'man', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'wonderful', 'competition', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'other', 'DVD', 'tapes', 'quality', 'level', 'pianistic', 'virtuosity', 'displayed', '13th', 'Van', 'Cliburn', 'International', 'Piano', 'Competition', 'previous', 'ones', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Ran', 'Dant', '6', 'finalists', 'were', 'stunning', 'spectacular', 'just', 'wanted', 'win', 'Gold', 'Mariangelina', 'Vocatello', 'was', 'favorite', 'next', 'Nobu', 'then', 'watching', 'hearing', 'Yeol', 'Eum', 'Som', 'formidable', 'Prokofiev', '2nd', 'unbelievable', 'also', 'really', 'love', 'appreciate', 'piano', 'played', 'absolute', 'finest', 'dvd', 'Yes', 'too', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'piano', 'time', 'human', 'interest', 'stories', 'here', 'were', 'too', 'good', 'neglect', 'anyway', 'can', 'go', 'Cliburn.tv', 'webcast', 'performances', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'heard', 'website']",A Surprise in Texas

I've never seen the previous 12 competitions, and I had not read the results of this 13th competition before watching this DVD, another in the fine series of releases from the German company Euroarts which is imported in the US by NAXOS. Secondly, I am not a musician (sorry no coordination) but a lover of all styles of good music and a huge fan of well-done documentaries.That said, I enjoyed this package (the film and the bonus musical performances) very much. Going in, I had no idea what the title meant and, though there is booklet with liner notes packed inside, I purposely did not read it beforehand. (And I suggest that future purchasers do the same.). I've been writing about documentaries based on competitions lately (cooking, harpists, among others). The arc of the story is usually to introduce all the contestants and then follow through as some are eliminated. You then can feel the passion and excitement as well as the anxiety of the competitors. If anything let me down with Peter Rosen's film it is that equal weight was not given to the stories of the finalists - and even the winners. I wanted to know more about Mr. Zhang from China and understand the background of the pianist from Bulgaria, whose idiosyncrasy is that he carries his own bench to competitions, and maybe more about the others too. The booklet fills us in a bit on the top three winners but that's it. It's a minor gripe but the reason for four stars instead of five. Some of the emotion that could have occurred with editing just didn't happen for me.But, for anyone interested in classical piano music and the next generation of artists, this is a great source. Of course it also says something about the music education in the schools in the US. Unless, I missed it through Director Rosen's editing, (and I could have), none of the 29 contestants in the First Round were Americans.There are a lot of performance excerpts in the film to satisfy the music lover and, thankfully five complete performances in the bonus section.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,Well done doc on the 2009 Piano Competition in Texas which everyone seemed to have known the winners beforehand except  me!,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,2141,"['scanning', 'other', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'must', 'admit', ""'m"", 'minority', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'previous', '12', 'competitions', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'results', '13th', 'competition', 'watching', 'DVD', 'fine', 'series', 'releases', 'German', 'company', 'Euroarts', 'imported', 'US', 'NAXOS', 'Secondly', 'am', 'not', 'musician', 'sorry', 'coordination', 'lover', 'styles', 'good', 'music', 'huge', 'fan', 'well-done', 'documentaries.That', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'package', 'film', 'bonus', 'musical', 'performances', 'very', 'much', 'Going', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'title', 'meant', 'booklet', 'liner', 'notes', 'packed', 'purposely', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'beforehand', 'suggest', 'future', 'purchasers', 'do', 'same.', ""'ve"", 'been', 'writing', 'documentaries', 'based', 'competitions', 'lately', 'cooking', 'harpists', 'others', 'arc', 'story', 'usually', 'introduce', 'contestants', 'then', 'follow', 'are', 'eliminated', 'then', 'can', 'feel', 'passion', 'excitement', 'as', 'well', 'anxiety', 'competitors', 'anything', 'let', 'down', 'Peter', 'Rosen', 'film', 'equal', 'weight', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'stories', 'finalists', 'even', 'winners', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Zhang', 'China', 'understand', 'background', 'pianist', 'Bulgaria', 'idiosyncrasy', 'own', 'bench', 'competitions', 'maybe', 'more', 'others', 'too', 'booklet', 'bit', 'top', 'three', 'winners', 'minor', 'gripe', 'reason', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'emotion', 'could', 'have', 'occurred', 'editing', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'me.But', 'anyone', 'interested', 'classical', 'piano', 'music', 'next', 'generation', 'artists', 'great', 'source', 'course', 'also', 'something', 'music', 'education', 'schools', 'US', 'Unless', 'missed', 'Director', 'Rosen', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'none', '29', 'contestants', 'First', 'Round', 'were', 'Americans.There', 'are', 'lot', 'performance', 'excerpts', 'film', 'satisfy', 'music', 'lover', 'thankfully', 'five', 'complete', 'performances', 'bonus', 'section.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",A Surprise in Texas

Park ""ctreric""","[1, 1]","While I was very impressed by the blind pianist Nobuyuki Tsujii who'd won the gold medal, I was actually more excited by the performances of the co-gold medalist Haochen Zhang and silver medalist Yeol Eum Son. Tsujii's performaces were great but his repertoire was a bit too typical to my taste. The ""wow"" moments for me were when Zhang played Stravinsky's ""Petrushka"" and Son did Liszt's ""Rhapsodie Espagnole."" Their technique, rhythmic sense, devotion and ceaseless passion made me so thrilled and mesmerized. I definitely saw a great potential in them. After watching this DVD, I wished more performances in full length had been featured to better understand and appreciate the pianists.
