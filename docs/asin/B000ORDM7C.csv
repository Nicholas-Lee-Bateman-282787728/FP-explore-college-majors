There were also a couple of other shows in the set that were corrupt and could not be played.So, we called the seller and have received a replacement set.  So far, this set is better but not perfect.  I'm now into Season Three and while no episodes have been corrupt they wouldn't play, a few episodes have hung up for a few seconds before continuing.Overall, I am so happy this series is on DVD but I am very disappointed in the quality if the DVDs.

The show is just as good as I remember and my 3 & 3/4 year old daughter loves it too!
