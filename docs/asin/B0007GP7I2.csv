880816,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B0007GP7I2,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[3, 5]","This movie contains a collection of the most rudderless, lost characters I've ever seen in my life.  The story seems to meander around as the lot of them try to make up their mind as to what they really want out of life.  All of the major personas have unhealthy relationships which they would be best to jettison....but they don't.While the story is far from compelling, the acting is good.  Kathleen Robertson is both beautiful AND she has a very strong screen presence.  I hope to see much more of her in the future.  If nothing else, the story of her character is pretty true to life;  a beautiful woman marries the biggest loser she can possibly find.  I've seen that happen all-too-frequently in my time.  Sarah Lassez is stunning, looks great topless and reminds me very much of a young Madeline Stowe.  While she played somewhat of a bit-part in this film as a femme fatale, she was captivating in all of her minutes in the movie.The male actors, I thought, left much more to be desired.  The main dude seemed to have a phobia about combing his hair as he looked like he just woke up all the way thru the film.  Is that in style now or something?  I can never keep up.....If you like movies that are way, way, way off the beaten path, you just might like this one.  However, the fact that the film is quaint does not mean it's necessarily good.  Just remember that if you choose to view it.",2,Which way is up?,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,1398,"['movie', 'collection', 'most', 'rudderless', 'lost', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'story', 'meander', 'around', 'lot', 'try', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'life', 'major', 'personas', 'have', 'unhealthy', 'relationships', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'jettison', '.but', ""don't.While"", 'story', 'far', 'compelling', 'acting', 'good', 'Kathleen', 'Robertson', 'beautiful', 'AND', 'very', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence', 'hope', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'future', 'nothing', 'else', 'story', 'character', 'pretty', 'true', 'life', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'biggest', 'loser', 'can', 'possibly', 'find', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'happen', 'all-too-frequently', 'time', 'Sarah', 'Lassez', 'stunning', 'great', 'topless', 'very', 'much', 'young', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'played', 'somewhat', 'bit-part', 'film', 'femme', 'fatale', 'was', 'captivating', 'minutes', 'movie.The', 'male', 'actors', 'thought', 'left', 'much', 'more', 'be', 'desired', 'main', 'dude', 'seemed', 'have', 'phobia', 'combing', 'hair', 'looked', 'just', 'woke', 'up', 'way', 'film', 'style', 'now', 'something', 'can', 'never', 'keep', 'up', '..If', 'movies', 'are', 'way', 'way', 'way', 'beaten', 'path', 'just', 'might', 'like', 'one', 'However', 'fact', 'film', 'quaint', 'not', 'mean', 'necessarily', 'good', 'Just', 'remember', 'choose', 'view']",N/A

It's a good movie, that I enjoy watching - yes, I'm still watching this because I'm still trying to keep up with who is doing what with who. I'd say this is the Japanese's view (having lived there once) of the world of photography, fashion, modeling, acting and the seemingly maddening lifestyles that one can get caught up in when part of this world. To me, no matter what ""world"" you run in -the emotions, changes, loves and hurts still happen like this, just to a different degree. Basically, people who appear to live like there is no tomorrow or not really care who they're with today or tomorrow go through the same madness as anyone when it comes to Love. Maybe it's my ADHD that keeps changing my mind about each character. I think just about anyone can relate to the characters, or at least one of them, because you live like this or have lived life like this at one time - and everyone knows how Love goes. People who like the darker indie films will enjoy this one.",5,Until the Night  ..... and on til dawn?,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,1047,"['NightMaybe', 'title', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'hedonism', 'good', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'yes', ""'m"", 'still', 'watching', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'who', 'doing', 'what', 'who', ""'d"", 'say', 'Japanese', 'view', 'having', 'lived', 'once', 'world', 'photography', 'fashion', 'modeling', 'acting', 'seemingly', 'maddening', 'lifestyles', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'when', 'part', 'world', 'matter', 'what', 'world', 'run', '-the', 'emotions', 'changes', 'loves', 'hurts', 'still', 'happen', 'just', 'different', 'degree', 'Basically', 'people', 'who', 'appear', 'live', 'tomorrow', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'who', ""'re"", 'today', 'tomorrow', 'go', 'same', 'madness', 'anyone', 'when', 'Love', 'Maybe', 'ADHD', 'changing', 'mind', 'character', 'think', 'just', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'characters', 'least', 'one', 'live', 'have', 'lived', 'life', 'one', 'time', 'everyone', 'how', 'Love', 'People', 'who', 'darker', 'indie', 'films', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one']",N/A

I watched it after watching Floating and I have to say, this movie is so badly acted. None of the characters seem to have any chemistry and I rarely knew what was supposed to be happening during most of the scenes. The only bright spot in the whole movie was Norman.

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I rented it because I like Kathleen Robertson. But in this movie she did nothing. I can't get into my review without saying this movie was very annoying because of all the smoking. I mean nonstop smoking. The male lead must have lit at least 50 cigarettes in this flick, he always had a butt going. One after another, after another. You what that means? That means they had nothing for this character to do. Get a clue Hollywood, smoking is not acting. I mean if he didn't smoke he would have just sat there for 3/4 of the movie doing absolutely nothing but sitting quietly in a corner, except for the endless drinking he did also. Smoking means the writing was lacking also and it surely was. THERE WAS NO PLOT, NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS MOVIE! It was like a meaningless documentary. You don't even get a CLUE as what's going on in his mind with all his ""introspection."" Here's what happened: You meet Kathleen Robertson who is a successful carrier girl. Doing what, we are never told. She goes home to her husband, who is apparently a deadbeat, and all this guy does, in every scene is smoke cigarettes and drink. She seems depressed by this. Then she meets up with this other guy, the guy who smokes ALL the time, who is apparently her former boyfriend.Although her husband makes her sad with all his drinking she gravitates towards her old boyfriend, who does nothing but, I hate to keep repeating it, but smoking and drinking.  She hangs with him but doesn't have an affair, which might have been interesting. Then the movie just ends, which I was thankful for. This movie is a horrible, pointless waste of time, avoid it at all costs.  I hope the director NEVER makes another movie!",1,Pointless waste of time and no talent,1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,1876,"['last', 'reviewer', 'must', 'be', 'insane', 'Intense', 'drama', 'got', 'be', 'kidding', 'drama', 'NOTHING', 'HAPPENS', 'movie', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'rented', 'like', 'Kathleen', 'Robertson', 'movie', 'did', 'nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'review', 'saying', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'annoying', 'smoking', 'mean', 'nonstop', 'smoking', 'male', 'lead', 'must', 'have', 'lit', 'least', '50', 'cigarettes', 'flick', 'always', 'had', 'butt', 'going', 'One', 'what', 'had', 'nothing', 'character', 'do', 'Get', 'clue', 'Hollywood', 'smoking', 'not', 'acting', 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'smoke', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'sat', '3/4', 'movie', 'doing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'sitting', 'quietly', 'corner', 'endless', 'drinking', 'did', 'also', 'Smoking', 'writing', 'was', 'lacking', 'also', 'surely', 'was', 'THERE', 'WAS', 'NO', 'PLOT', 'NOTHING', 'HAPPENS', 'IN', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'was', 'meaningless', 'documentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'CLUE', 'what', 'going', 'mind', 'introspection', 'Here', 'what', 'happened', 'meet', 'Kathleen', 'Robertson', 'who', 'successful', 'carrier', 'girl', 'Doing', 'what', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'home', 'husband', 'who', 'apparently', 'deadbeat', 'guy', 'scene', 'smoke', 'cigarettes', 'drink', 'depressed', 'Then', 'up', 'other', 'guy', 'guy', 'who', 'time', 'who', 'apparently', 'former', 'husband', 'sad', 'drinking', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'nothing', 'hate', 'keep', 'repeating', 'smoking', 'drinking', ""n't"", 'have', 'affair', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'Then', 'movie', 'just', 'ends', 'was', 'thankful', 'movie', 'horrible', 'pointless', 'waste', 'time', 'avoid', 'costs', 'hope', 'director', 'NEVER', 'movie']",N/A
