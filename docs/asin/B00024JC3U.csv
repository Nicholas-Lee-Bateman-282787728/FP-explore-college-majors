If you're trying to put it behind you, then you may not want to see this movie. But for those who loved the show and who like cheesy comedies, this 2004 big screen rendition might be for you.The stars this time around are Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in the roles as David Starsky and Ken Hutchinson respectively. Stiller is a more serious character and Wilson is more laid back and funny, even bordering on stupid at times. The two don't seem to get along that well, but they end up as partners regardless as they try to complete a drug sting. Along they way, they get some help from a character named Huggy Bear, played by Snoop Dogg- one of the best parts of the film. Huggy Bear seems like a cool, slick helpful type of guy, but you don't really know whose side he is on. Snoop Dogg is, basically, playing himself in this role. He always has that cool, calm, confident demeanor no matter when I see him on the small or large screen.The music in this film comes from the 1970's, and much of it is forgettable, just like the 1970's were forgettable. One particularly nauseating scene (or funny, depending on how you look at it) has Owen Wilson taking a guitar from his partner and proceeding to play the song ""Don't Give up on Us"". Most viewers won't recognize this song at all, but it is, in fact, an old hit single from the 1970's by the original Hutch, David Soul.Some of the comedy here is funny, but other parts of the movie don't quite seem to hit the mark.

If you classify yourself as the stereotypical man's man, the film will be worthwhile for two reasons: 1) Starsky and Hutch (as in the original series) drive an awesome car and 2) you'll get to watch Carmen Electra kiss another girl.Reasons not to see this movie: Again, as indicated by the title, without the chemistry between Wilson and Stiller, this movie would've been a complete disaster.

They either barely resemble the original (like the Claire Danes version of The Mod Squad) or turn it into kitsch parody (like The Flintstones). More often than not the contemporary update pales in comparison. As a result, there was a healthy dose of skepticism when a remake of Starsky and Hutch was announced. Would Hollywood ruin yet another vintage TV show?Surprisingly, the movie is not an out-and-out parody but plays things fairly straight. It is set in the 1970s and actually has a story that one can follow instead of the typical M.O. of these kinds of films that simply string together a bunch of loosely connected comedic set pieces.Starsky and Hutch is a vehicle tailor-made for Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson's comedic talents. Stiller plays Starsky as an intense, by-the-book cop, while Wilson's Hutch is the laid-back, loose cannon. You would think that after all of the films they've done together their schtick would have gotten old by now. However, they play so well off each other. Their comic timing is dead-on. The give and take of the dialogue between them is effortless and enjoyable to watch as the mellow Hutch constantly baits the easily flustered Starsky.There is an audio commentary by director Todd Phillips. He dishes a lot of trivial factoids on this rather bland track.""Fashion Fa Shizzle Wit Huggy Bizzle"" is a brief tour of Huggy Bear's funky retro outfits and stylin' pimp wear with Snoop Dog. Not surprisingly, ol' Snoop displays a real knowledge of `70s fashion.""Last Look Special"" gently makes fun of these kinds of puff promo pieces as Stiller, Wilson, et al ""talk trash"" about director Phillips. This is a fun, little extra.There are several deleted scenes that run six minutes in total, including one that has Starsky lecturing Hutch about peeing in public. There are some funny bits here and it's a shame that many of them were cut out.There is also a five minute ""Gag Reel"" that is a slightly amusing collection of blown lines as the cast try hard to keep a straight face during certain scenes.Finally, there is the obligatory theatrical trailer.This is a movie that could have been so easy to screw up. It's amazing that all involved did such a good job. They've created an entertaining and funny movie that pays homage to the classic TV series and yet also stands on its own.

But in the first five minutes, I felt the film had some promise.  However, as in some of their other films, I feel that you either love watching these guys play themselves or you do not.  Neither of them is able to create dynamic characters.  Instead, they just simply play themselves in every movie and let the cards fall where they will.  Of course, I realize that there are some pretty serious fan clubs out there for both of these guys.  Thus, if you are someone who loves watching either of these guys, then you will probably get a kick out of STARSKY & HUTCH.

Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, who were co-stars in ""Zoolander"", re-team as the cop duo, based on the TV series which ran on ABC from 1975-79. Stiller and Wilson have superb chemistry, and seem to be having a really good time on screen. The cast is further complemented by solid performances from Snoop Dogg as informant Huggy Bear, and Vince Vaughn as the cocaine-smuggling Reese. Todd Phillips, who directed the grossly overrated ""Old School"", faithfully recreates the 70's feel of the show, right down to the songs used in the film. Naturally, a television series which becomes a movie isn't complete without the original actors from the show in cameo appearances, so look for Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky) and David Soul (Hutch)in a clever sequence. I was quite surprised at just how entertaining ""Starsky & Hutch"" is, given the generally vague memories I have of the original show.

824708,A3CT2I82NPANNS,B00024JC3U,Desiree Troy,"[5, 6]","I was originally interested in the movie Starsky & Hutch because Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson starred in it together. I had seem them act together in both The Royal Tenenbaums and Zoolander and realised that they made one of the greatest comedic duos I had ever seen in movies. The way that they play off one another so effortlessly is what makes their movies so entertaining to watch. Starsky & Hutch was no exception. I have never seen an episode of the original show but I am actually considering doing so out of curiosity.Ben Stiller plays David Starsky, a police officer who appears to be hopelessly uptight. However, we soon realise that he has his wild side and a bit of an unnatural maternal instinct for his car. Owen Wilson plays Ken 'Hutch' Hutchinson, an unprofessional police officer who is entirely nonchalant in pretty much any situation he and Starsky find themselves in. A few other lead characters are Snoop Dogg who plays Huggy Bear (who as far as I could tell was just a stoned drug dealer with an aversion to being touched) and Vince Vaughn who plays Reese Feldman, a disgusting little worm of a man (i. e. a drug dealer).The movie opens on Feldman's yacht. He is unhappy about the loss of some of his cocaine and shoots the person responsible, Terrence Meyers (played very briefly by David Pressman). Then there's a scene of Starsky chasing a purse-snatcher, clearly the man has a bit of an ego and this is only proven when he opens fire in the midst of citizens. We are also introduced to Hutch who gets busted as he's leaving a small business that he just robbed with a couple other men. After that, we meet Captain Doby (played by Fred Williamson) and Starsky and Hutch are made partners.At first Starsky's and Hutch's personalities clash and they have minor squabbles over trivial things such as when it's appropriate to actually come into work, whether or not to answer a radio call at noon, and what to do with a floater (nudge it into the current with a stick or actually do their job and solve crime?). Slowly, but surely, they begin to rub off on each other (although we don't get to see most of that unfortunately). They also begin to grow to like one another and learn how to work together despite their differences and subsequent bickering.Since I have never seen an actual episode of the show that this spoof was based on, I can't really say how good of a job that the cast and crew did on making a complete mockery of the show, but I can say that I was sufficiently amused. My laughs were sparse at first but I found that halfway through the movie I was laughing uproariously. To say that this movie was entertaining would be a bit of an understatement. The script was great and the cast pulled off all the jokes smoothly, proof of their talent and sense of humour. A few other performances worth mentioning and paying attention to were Juliette Lewis's role as Kitty (Feldman's ""girl-on-the-side"") and Will Ferrell's role as Big Earl (a prisoner who is very much into dragons and... Hutch... or Dragon Hutch in other words).Despite the fact that I did like this movie for the acting, comedy, and satire, I just wasn't very impressed with the overall result. I do enjoy comedies, especially anything with Ben Stiller and/or Owen Wilson, but I tend to lean toward dramas and I don't like movies about drugs or with very little plot. I understand that this was a spoof and that was the point, but I think that it could have been made a bit more intelligent in that area, by filling it slightly. The target audience, I'm sure, was probably more attracted to this film than someone like me who prefers foreign films rather than American movies. A good example of an intelligent satire would be the French film Bon Voyage.I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan Stiller/Wilson movies and light-hearted comedies. It's not very substantial, but it will keep you amused until the credits roll.",3,To say that this movie was entertaining would be a bit of an understatement,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,3926,"['was', 'originally', 'interested', 'movie', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'starred', 'together', 'had', 'seem', 'act', 'together', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Zoolander', 'realised', 'made', 'one', 'greatest', 'comedic', 'duos', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'movies', 'way', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'what', 'movies', 'so', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'was', 'exception', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'original', 'show', 'am', 'actually', 'considering', 'doing', 'so', 'curiosity.Ben', 'Stiller', 'David', 'Starsky', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'be', 'hopelessly', 'uptight', 'However', 'soon', 'realise', 'wild', 'side', 'bit', 'unnatural', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'car', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Ken', ""'Hutch"", 'Hutchinson', 'unprofessional', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'entirely', 'nonchalant', 'pretty', 'much', 'situation', 'Starsky', 'find', 'few', 'other', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'who', 'Huggy', 'Bear', 'who', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'just', 'stoned', 'drug', 'dealer', 'aversion', 'being', 'touched', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'Reese', 'Feldman', 'disgusting', 'little', 'worm', 'man', 'i.', 'drug', 'dealer', 'movie', 'Feldman', 'yacht', 'unhappy', 'loss', 'cocaine', 'shoots', 'person', 'responsible', 'Terrence', 'Meyers', 'played', 'very', 'briefly', 'David', 'Pressman', 'Then', 'scene', 'Starsky', 'chasing', 'purse-snatcher', 'clearly', 'man', 'bit', 'ego', 'only', 'proven', 'when', 'fire', 'midst', 'citizens', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'Hutch', 'who', 'busted', 'leaving', 'small', 'business', 'just', 'robbed', 'couple', 'other', 'men', 'meet', 'Captain', 'Doby', 'played', 'Fred', 'Williamson', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'are', 'made', 'first', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'personalities', 'clash', 'have', 'minor', 'squabbles', 'trivial', 'things', 'such', 'when', 'appropriate', 'actually', 'come', 'work', 'not', 'answer', 'radio', 'call', 'noon', 'what', 'do', 'floater', 'nudge', 'current', 'stick', 'actually', 'do', 'job', 'solve', 'crime', 'Slowly', 'surely', 'begin', 'rub', 'off', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'most', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'begin', 'grow', 'like', 'one', 'learn', 'how', 'work', 'together', 'differences', 'subsequent', 'bickering.Since', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'actual', 'episode', 'show', 'spoof', 'was', 'based', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'how', 'good', 'job', 'cast', 'crew', 'did', 'making', 'complete', 'mockery', 'show', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'sufficiently', 'amused', 'laughs', 'were', 'sparse', 'first', 'found', 'halfway', 'movie', 'was', 'laughing', 'uproariously', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'understatement', 'script', 'was', 'great', 'cast', 'pulled', 'off', 'jokes', 'smoothly', 'proof', 'talent', 'sense', 'humour', 'few', 'other', 'performances', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'paying', 'attention', 'were', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'role', 'Kitty', 'Feldman', 'girl-on-the-side', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'role', 'Big', 'Earl', 'prisoner', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'dragons', 'Hutch', 'Dragon', 'Hutch', 'other', 'words', '.Despite', 'fact', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'acting', 'comedy', 'satire', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'impressed', 'overall', 'result', 'do', 'enjoy', 'comedies', 'especially', 'anything', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'tend', 'lean', 'dramas', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'drugs', 'very', 'little', 'plot', 'understand', 'was', 'spoof', 'was', 'point', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'bit', 'more', 'intelligent', 'area', 'filling', 'slightly', 'target', 'audience', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'attracted', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'prefers', 'foreign', 'films', 'rather', 'American', 'movies', 'good', 'example', 'intelligent', 'satire', 'would', 'be', 'French', 'film', 'Bon', 'Voyage.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'Stiller/Wilson', 'movies', 'light-hearted', 'comedies', 'not', 'very', 'substantial', 'will', 'keep', 'amused', 'credits', 'roll']",Starsky & Hutch VHS
824709,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B00024JC3U,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[1, 1]","'Starsky and Hutch' is a remake of a 70's TV show of the same name. Ben Stiller plays David Starsky and Owen Wilson plays Ken Hutchinson, a.k.a. &quot;Hutch.&quot; Both characters are police officers in Bay City. Starsky is a &quot;by the book&quot; officer, while Hutch is laid back officer willing to bend the rules.Joining Wilson and Stiller are Snoop Dogg as Huggy Bear and Vince Vaughn as Reese Feldman, the movie's villain. Huggy Bear is a pimp character of sorts, and a friend of Hutch. Feldman is a cocaine dealer plotting to distribute millions of dollars of cocaine that has been engineered to be undetectable.The characters and actors are what make this movie watchable. Wilson and Stiller have teamed up on other projects, and they always play well together. Stiller's performance can be somewhat forced, but his best scenes come when his character is undercover. Wilson plays a character that is similar to most of the characters he plays in other movies: a laid back, 90's type of guy. Snoop was perfect as Huggy Bear, right down to the 70's style fur coats, cane, and pimp attitude. Vaughn was remarkable as well.Will Ferrell has a small role in the movie. It was a shame he wasn't used more. His casting was dead on for the role he played. His delivery and interation with Wilson and Stiller lead to one of the funnier scenes with a few funny follow up references later in the movie. There is also a cameo at the end of the movie by a couple of other actors. I won't name them so as to not spoil the surprise. The cameo seemed a bit forced and a bit long. If it had been a bit shorter and tighter, it could have been funnier.Where the movie loses points is in the delivery of the jokes. At times, the movie plodded along, and some of the jokes were either forced, or took to long to set up and didn't deliver enough of a laugh as a payoff. There is a great scene at the beginning of the movie where one of Huggy's henchmen recites facts about everything in the middle of stand off with Starsky like he is World Book Encyclopedia. This scene worked, but unfortunately, it wasn't followed up on well.There are several DVD extras, but none of them are extraordinary. The gag reel largely features scenes that got flubbed because the actors couldn't stop giggling through their lines. The deleted scenes only would have helped the story minimally, and it was easy to see why they were deleted. There is a featurette, in which the actors pretend to have hated working with each other and the director. It is funny because it is obvious they don't mean what they say, but after a few minutes, the joke just seems cruel, especially while the director says such admirable things about the cast.This movie is fun, and definitely worth a rental. I haven't seen much of the 70's TV show to make a decent comparison. This is a movie that you can watch while you do something else, and you won't miss a whole lot. I wanted to give it four stars, but I'm not sure I enjoyed it enough to give that rating.",3,"Fun, but not Great",1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,3006,"[""'Starsky"", 'Hutch', 'remake', '70', 'TV', 'show', 'same', 'name', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'David', 'Starsky', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Ken', 'Hutchinson', 'a.k.a', 'quot', 'Hutch.', 'quot', 'characters', 'are', 'police', 'officers', 'Bay', 'City', 'Starsky', 'quot', 'book', 'quot', 'officer', 'Hutch', 'laid', 'back', 'officer', 'willing', 'bend', 'rules.Joining', 'Wilson', 'Stiller', 'are', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Huggy', 'Bear', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Reese', 'Feldman', 'movie', 'villain', 'Huggy', 'Bear', 'pimp', 'character', 'sorts', 'friend', 'Hutch', 'Feldman', 'cocaine', 'dealer', 'plotting', 'distribute', 'millions', 'dollars', 'cocaine', 'been', 'engineered', 'be', 'undetectable.The', 'characters', 'actors', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'watchable', 'Wilson', 'Stiller', 'have', 'teamed', 'up', 'other', 'projects', 'always', 'play', 'well', 'together', 'Stiller', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'best', 'scenes', 'come', 'when', 'character', 'undercover', 'Wilson', 'character', 'similar', 'most', 'characters', 'other', 'movies', 'laid', 'back', '90', 'type', 'guy', 'Snoop', 'was', 'perfect', 'Huggy', 'Bear', 'right', 'down', '70', 'style', 'fur', 'coats', 'cane', 'pimp', 'attitude', 'Vaughn', 'was', 'remarkable', 'well.Will', 'Ferrell', 'small', 'role', 'movie', 'was', 'shame', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'more', 'casting', 'was', 'dead', 'role', 'played', 'delivery', 'interation', 'Wilson', 'Stiller', 'lead', 'one', 'funnier', 'scenes', 'few', 'funny', 'follow', 'up', 'references', 'later', 'movie', 'also', 'cameo', 'end', 'movie', 'couple', 'other', 'actors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'name', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'surprise', 'cameo', 'seemed', 'bit', 'forced', 'bit', 'long', 'had', 'been', 'bit', 'shorter', 'tighter', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funnier.Where', 'movie', 'points', 'delivery', 'jokes', 'times', 'movie', 'plodded', 'jokes', 'were', 'either', 'forced', 'took', 'long', 'set', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'enough', 'laugh', 'payoff', 'great', 'scene', 'beginning', 'movie', 'where', 'one', 'Huggy', 'henchmen', 'facts', 'everything', 'middle', 'stand', 'Starsky', 'World', 'Book', 'Encyclopedia', 'scene', 'worked', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'followed', 'up', 'well.There', 'are', 'several', 'DVD', 'extras', 'none', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'gag', 'reel', 'largely', 'scenes', 'got', 'flubbed', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'giggling', 'lines', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'only', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'story', 'minimally', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'deleted', 'featurette', 'actors', 'pretend', 'have', 'hated', 'working', 'other', 'director', 'funny', 'obvious', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'what', 'say', 'few', 'minutes', 'joke', 'just', 'cruel', 'especially', 'director', 'such', 'admirable', 'things', 'cast.This', 'movie', 'fun', 'definitely', 'rental', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', '70', 'TV', 'show', 'make', 'decent', 'comparison', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'whole', 'lot', 'wanted', 'give', 'four', 'stars', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'enjoyed', 'enough', 'give', 'rating']",Starsky & Hutch VHS

If anybody needed another example that Owen Wilson cannot act and is not funny other than the very lame ""Shanghai Knights"" then look no further than this film.  He reminds me of a less intelligent Dennis Miller, always trying to come across as cute but without the wit.  Blah!  Then there is the flimsy and altogether predictable and flat script.  It made me wonder how on Earth the producers managed to get so many ""name"" actors for bit roles.  When the drug-deal story goes stale(as it frequently does) Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are called upon to improvise by wearing ridiculous costumes and managing to sneak their way into various locations.  The script even calls for the obligatory passing of the torch from the original actors who starred in the television show by having them hand over the keys to that very cool car.  The best thing about the show was the car, not the acting or the predictable tough-guy dialogue.  ""Let's come up with a new movie idea based on an antiquated television show!""  Sound familiar.  Here it is again.  The only redeeming factor in the entire film(other than Carmen Electra in a cameo as a cheerleader, ouch!) is Ben Stiller.  He seems to be the only person concerned with making this once popular iconic television show into a parody, which is the only sensible thing to do.  He has a few outright hilarious scenes and plays a few other characters that are crazy and quotable.  It's just too bad no one else shared his energy or his vision while making this otherwise dumb film.  As far as Snoop Dogg playing the character Huggy Bear...hoodlums waxing intellectual has been done before.  His presence is wasted in every other scene with stilted dialogue and unbelievable situations.  This film is a waste of time for anyone who isn't a Ben Stiller fan.  As for his fans I recommend renting this film and not buying it, then picking up his other recent film ""Duplex"" which is funnier by leaps and bounds.

824711,A1OIPRC7LMNN9V,B00024JC3U,Dominic,"[11, 12]","Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are two of the funniest actors around these days, and they're even funnier when they're teamed up. Starsky and Hutch puts them in the roles of two drastically different cops chosen to work together. This approach may seem overdone, but Stiller and Wilson keep the screen fresh. They are both incredible actors and comedians; it would be hard to watch this film without laughing out loud.Owen Wilson is Hutch, a laid back cop that likes to bend the rules. He never gets any work done and even drinks on the job. Starsky is the exact opposite. He is uptight and follows the rules to the book. You wouldn't guess, but he's also one hell of a driver. His car of choice is a red Grand Torino, and man can he make it fly. However, both Starsky and Hutch are outcastes at the police office, so they are put together. Naturally, the two characters hate each other when first paired up.They soon get on the case of some drug dealers who are trying to get a new genetically engineered type of cocaine onto the streets. Vince Vaughn does an incredible job as the ringleader of this operation. He is serious and sinister in a way that just makes you laugh.And then there is the infamous Huggy Bear. I've never seen the television series so I have no idea what he's supposed to be like, but Snoop Dogg is hilarious. Huggy Bear calls himself an urban informer. Basically he tells Hutch what the word on the street is so Hutch won't go and bust him. I think Snoop Dogg did a great job acting this part because he really didn't have to act. Huggy Bear wears lots of bling, talks slowly in a mellow voice, and knows a lot about drugs. Just like Snoop Dogg.One of my favorite scenes pits Starsky against Dancing Rick in a disco dance off. It sounds cheesy, and it is. They pull off some really cool and original moves that'll have you splitting your sides with laughter. Another one of my favorite clips involves Starsky playing Russian Roulette while interrogating a suspect. In fact, just about every scene in the movie made me laugh. That's when you know you have a high quality comedy.There are no bad characters in this film. Carmen Electra and Amy Smart play some sizzling love interests. Huggy Bear's crew is even worth a few chuckles. Will Ferrell has perhaps the funniest part in the film. The only downside to Starsky and Hutch is that it comes up a little short on the action side. This isn't a real problem because whatever the film lacks in action it makes up for in comedy twofold.

I liked Owen Wilson as the wisecracking ladies' man in Jackie Chan's &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot; but in this movie, Owen's feminine side comes out and there are occasions when he is distinctly effeminate. A tough cop that is a poofter?? Totally out of character unlike the old TV series where the two partners are really macho and cool. Owen Wilson's character is also corrupt and steals money right at the start of the show unlike the old TV series where they were tough, brutal, hard hitting but straight and honest cops. Even &quot;Huggy Bear&quot; is like a shadow of the old &quot;Huggy Bear&quot;. This &quot;Huggy&quot; is really wierd and looks like a child molester. The only saving grace are the two voluptuous College cheer leaders that really turn you on. The action sequences are predictable and very boring.

824713,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B00024JC3U,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[1, 1]","I can't really say how this movie compares to the popular T.V. show from the 1970s.  I was only 6 years old in 1975, and STARSKY & HUTCH came on after my bedtime.  I may have seen a couple of episodes, but all I remember vividly is the trademark red Grand Torino with the white stripe.Insofar as the car is concerned, it has been resurrected for the current movie.  I am inclined to believe that the humor of the movie is much more of the slapstick variety than any humor displayed in the T.V. series.  There is one curious aspect about this remake, however:  unlike most remakes, this one takes place in its original epoch of the 1970s as opposed to being an ""updated"" rendition that takes place in the present day.By far & away the weakest part of the movie is the inclusion of Snoop Dog.  He is absolutely the worst actor that ever lived;  every scene he is in, is like taking the air out of a balloon.  Trying to teach him to act is like trying to teach an alligator to be a vegetarian.  He is probably the most talentless self-made millionaire the world has ever seen - bar none.  I would beg Snoop Dog to kindly disappear from the public eye - the world would be a better place for it.I am puzzled as to why it went the route of being rated PG-13.  After all, nobody under 35 would even be aware that there WAS an old T.V. show called STARSKY & HUTCH.  It had some opportunities for gratiutous nudity that would have made it a good old-fashioned ""R"" Rated slapstick comedy.  For some unknown reason, it shied away from this and ended up being a teaser flick.As for the rest of the movie, it is OK.  Nothing great, nothing terrible.  For some, it might be nostalgic as it goes back to the 1970s.  Other people, including me, will have nightmares about DISCO making a comeback (yikes!).

824715,A4FAPQKQQLJY1,B00024JC3U,Elite,"[0, 0]","Like another reviewer said here, I wasn't impressed with Dodgeball. I thought it was ok, but nothing special. With that in mind, I wasn't really all thrilled to see Starsky & Hutch. After watching the DVD, I came away with a new respect for Ben Stiller.Stiller isn't the only one in this movie, but he is the one who you can tell makes the flick. As you all know, the movie is based off of a 70's TV series. It's about two cops who sometimes cross the line of the law to get the job done. Sometimes with humorous results. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson play their characters perfectly. Stiller especially, has the Starsky character down pat. The film was directed by Todd Phillips. I enjoyed ""Road Trip"" & ""Old School"", so that was a plus to me.The plot of the film isn't really that deep, to be honest. A drug kingpin (Vince Vaughn) kills one of this henchmen and Starsky and Hutch are put on the case after the body washed ashore. Along the way, the two cops get into all sorts of fun and crazy situations. There is scene after scene of laughter. This is one of those movies where you will be talking about scenes with your friends and even imatating the characters. When you see the scene where Stiller plays a character with the catch-phrase ""Do it. Do it"", you will know what I mean. That little phrase has now become part of my regular vocabulary, for better of worse.The acting is quite good here. Ben Stiller is amazing. You can see his comedic genius here even along side his buddy Owen Wilson. I will admit they do play off each other quite well, but I have never been impressed with Wilson. His voice drives me nuts and I think he is a terrible actor. If anyone reading this has wasted time out of their lives to watch ""The Big Bounce"", you will know what I mean.Along with Stiller, Vince Vaughn takes the movie. Once again, he is amazing. I have loved him in every movie I have seen him in and he is great here as the villain. While not playing the typical psychotic, over the top badguy....he plays a slimy, but yet funny & cool badguy. Snoop Dog is also very good. I couldn't think of any other actor that could have played the role of 'Huggy Bear' more perfectly. He took the role and just owned it.Honestly, I wasn't too geared to see this flick. After seeing it and laughing like crazy for 100 min., I could highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants a good comedy.Special Features: There is a decent commentary track with the director Todd Phillips. He isn't too bad on it, and is insightful enough to keep you awake. I wish Stiller and Wilson would have been on it, but I guess they were too busy. There are deleted scenes. There are a few that I was really happy they kept out, but some could have been in. There is a short featurette with Snoop about his wardrobe. The gag reel is kinda funny. Most of it is just people messing up lines. The best supplement is the ""promotional featurette"". It starts off like one of those crappy ""everyone kisses everyone's butt"" ones, then it goes into the actors all complaining about each other and the director. They basically just trash the movie and complain about everything. It's hilarious and I wish more movies would do this. You can tell this cast had a lot of fun making the movie, so this was a riot.",4,One of the funniest films of the year.......,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,3270,"['reviewer', 'said', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'Dodgeball', 'thought', 'was', 'ok', 'nothing', 'special', 'mind', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'thrilled', 'see', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'watching', 'DVD', 'came', 'away', 'new', 'respect', 'Ben', 'Stiller.Stiller', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'tell', 'flick', 'know', 'movie', 'based', '70', 'TV', 'series', 'two', 'cops', 'who', 'sometimes', 'cross', 'line', 'law', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Sometimes', 'humorous', 'results', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'play', 'characters', 'perfectly', 'Stiller', 'especially', 'Starsky', 'character', 'down', 'pat', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'enjoyed', 'Road', 'Trip', 'Old', 'School', 'was', 'plus', 'me.The', 'plot', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'deep', 'be', 'honest', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'one', 'henchmen', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'are', 'put', 'case', 'body', 'washed', 'ashore', 'way', 'two', 'cops', 'get', 'sorts', 'fun', 'crazy', 'situations', 'scene', 'scene', 'laughter', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'talking', 'scenes', 'friends', 'even', 'imatating', 'characters', 'When', 'see', 'scene', 'where', 'Stiller', 'character', 'catch-phrase', 'Do', 'Do', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'little', 'phrase', 'now', 'become', 'part', 'regular', 'vocabulary', 'better', 'worse.The', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'amazing', 'can', 'see', 'comedic', 'genius', 'here', 'even', 'side', 'buddy', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'will', 'admit', 'do', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'quite', 'well', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'impressed', 'Wilson', 'voice', 'drives', 'nuts', 'think', 'terrible', 'actor', 'anyone', 'reading', 'wasted', 'time', 'lives', 'watch', 'Big', 'Bounce', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean.Along', 'Stiller', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'movie', 'Once', 'again', 'amazing', 'have', 'loved', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'great', 'here', 'villain', 'not', 'playing', 'typical', 'psychotic', 'top', 'badguy', '.he', 'slimy', 'yet', 'funny', 'cool', 'badguy', 'Snoop', 'Dog', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'role', ""'Huggy"", 'Bear', 'more', 'perfectly', 'took', 'role', 'just', 'owned', 'it.Honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'geared', 'see', 'flick', 'seeing', 'laughing', 'crazy', '100', 'min.', 'could', 'highly', 'recommend', 'flick', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'comedy.Special', 'Features', 'decent', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Todd', 'Phillips', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'insightful', 'enough', 'keep', 'awake', 'wish', 'Stiller', 'Wilson', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'guess', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'was', 'really', 'happy', 'kept', 'out', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'short', 'featurette', 'Snoop', 'wardrobe', 'gag', 'reel', 'kinda', 'funny', 'Most', 'just', 'people', 'messing', 'up', 'lines', 'best', 'supplement', 'promotional', 'featurette', 'one', 'crappy', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'butt', 'ones', 'then', 'actors', 'complaining', 'other', 'director', 'basically', 'just', 'trash', 'movie', 'complain', 'everything', 'hilarious', 'wish', 'more', 'movies', 'would', 'do', 'can', 'tell', 'cast', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'riot']",Starsky & Hutch VHS

If you're going to jump a car over something and it becomes top-heavy and slams in the the ground, there's *no way* it's gonna continue to drive and look like new.

Does the director think we're stupid?The movie has some real style.  The 70's never looked so good.  But style doesn't save a movie.

Stiller, one of the most talented comic actors of his age, here goes for shallow caricature rather than developing a true shallow character.  Where it worked for him in Zoolander it fails here.  In fact it's as though Stiller decided to ape Zoolander playing Starsky.  An interesting premise perhaps, but its execution falls fairly flat.Owen Wilson doesn't give much more, and doesn't fare much better.The duo are not without some funny moments, but overall there were long stretches of nothing padding out the comic bits.The film is worth watching primarily for the performances of Vince Vaughan and Snoop Dog's Huggy Bear - both breathing life into an otherwise fairly stagnant vehicle.Also worthwhile is Juliette Lewis in an inflated cameo is wonderful, and more than any other cast member, embodies the sexual innocence gone haywire that seemed to fuel the 70's.Hard to believe Chris Penn in the role he has here.  Completely unrecognizable.Even harder to believe is that this was directed by Todd Phillips, the director who gave us the unflinching, hard hitting documentary ""Hated"" about the twisted, revolting life of punk anti-hero G.G. Allin. Phillips would go on to impress in the comedies Old School and Road Trip.  Faced here with a period piece he relies too heavily on site gags (oversized portable phones, radios, etc.) which cannot alone carry a film.These types of films fail because they are all surface and too little substance.  The original Starsky & Hutch seems funny to us now because there was a sincerity in respecting the material.  The material may not have been great, but the premise was and the execution by David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser nearly perfect.Phillips has been announced as the director for The Six Million Dollar Man with Jim Carrey.

Vince Vaughn, of all people, has the best responses (and lines).  I can think of only three laughs in the film, and they were all from Vaughn's laidback responses (""Hey guys I think I can speak for the rest of us when I say we're all MIMED out"").  A couple of chuckles elsewhere, maybe.  Jason Bateman is completely wasted in this.  Snoop Dog comes out ok, I guess.  The movie is too in love w/ its retro feel to present some gut busters that you'd expect from a movie starring Wilson and Stiller.  Maybe it wasn't supposed to be a big comedy?  Zoolander, a movie panned by critics, had far more laughs than this.Stiller brings in a character from his hilarious short lived skit-show, the Ben Stiller show, the ""Do it...DO it!"" guy, and I think that's just symbolic of the movie as a whole--trying to borrow the laughs from other material.

Boy am I glad I did. This movie was a truly funny movie that did not force the audience to laugh by doing crazy things. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson really clicked in this movie and that really helped the experience. The movie is not a parody, it's not making fun of the 70's like Anchorman is. This is just a funny spin on a classic tv show, and sure you'll find a little spoof on things here and there.. It's not as over the top as Zoolander, which was a very vivid parody on the modeling world. This was a good comedy that I really enjoyed. I really hate comparing it to Dodgeball and Anchorman but I have to because all the cast members are in each of these movies except for Owen Wilson. I actually found Will Ferrel funnier in here than I did in Anchorman. Never will this movie force you to laugh nor will it have crazy things that have no reference whatsoever. So, if you need to wash that bad taste of Dodgeball and Anchorman out of your mouth then this is the movie to do it with. Great to own, a must to rent.VIDEO: The video turned out great for this kind of movie. There are a lot of bright colors in this movie and every thing was sharp and crisp. Ususally red is a nightmare for movies because it blurs very easily, but Starsky's car was so very shiny on my HDTV.AUDIO: The standard 5.1 mix does the job, and actually will surpass your expectations. It certainly surpassed mine.PACKAGING / EXTRAS: Oh my! Another single disc release from Warner in an Armary case. Maybe they got rid of those cheap snapper cases for good, but there is no insert. The extras are a bit wimpy as well. You have a commentary by the director, a funny take on making of documentaries, a look at Snoop Dog's character, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a trailer.

824738,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00024JC3U,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 6]","&quot;Starsky & Hutch&quot; exceeds expectations, which you have to admit have been lowered considerably when it comes to all of the movies that have been made recycling old television shows. This is perhaps to be expected when you understand that the target audience for these films consists of people who have probably never seen an episode of &quot;I Spy&quot; or &quot;The Mod Squad,&quot; and who are would be more familiar with the famous poster of Farrah Fawcett than any single episode of &quot;Charlie's Angels.&quot; But this 2004 comedy has two advantages.First, there is a rich tradition of buddy films where a &quot;good&quot; person and a &quot;bad&quot; person team up and overcome their differences to work together, extending back from Riggs & Murtaugh to Butch & Sundance, all the way back to Katie Scarlet & Miss Melly. &quot;Starsky&quot; and &quot;Hutch&quot; plays with this tried and true formula, mainly by tweaking it, but the key thing is that the film embraces the idea at the same time it is lampooning it. This is, all things considered, a gentle comedy telling the story of how Starksy and Hutch came to meet, even with Snoop Dogg bringing something of an edge to Huggy Bear.Second, there is pretty good chemistry between Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as Starsky and Hutch; they should since this is their sixth film together. In fact, this is the most chemistry Stiller has shown with anybody in one of his films since he worked with DeNiro. Stiller is helped by the fact that his Starsky tends to go over the top but still manages to get the job done. You keep thinking he is about to make a fool of himself, and he certainly moves in that direction, but things never get so far out of hand that he becomes just a big joke.The big joke in the film would be the plan of bad guy Reese Feldman (Vince Vaughn) who has invented a former of cocaine that has even German shepherds cannot detect. In other words, Feldman has invented (wait for it) &quot;new Coke.&quot; But the plot is merely an excuse for Stiller and Wilson to do scenes together and it the spirit of true partnership each gets humiliated in turn, such as when a jailhouse snitch (Will Ferrell) makes Hutch show his belly button (then things get really weird), and then they get humiliated together. It is not like we do not know that in the end Feldman is going down, because he is going down hard, man, so the plot is not the point. Furthermore, the supporting case of Juliette Lewis, Amy Smart, Carmen Electra, and Fred Williamson as Captain Dobey is pretty good for this sort of film.Plus, you have Starsky's beloved bright-red supercharged Ford Gran Torino, which he drives like a crazy person and then becomes incensed by the thought it might get scratched or dented. The homage to the original consists of the requisite appearance by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul, as well as Wilson warbling Soul's one hit, &quot;Don't Give Up on Us Baby,&quot; a joke that is going to be lost on most of the viewers. Actually, throughout the film director Todd Phillips makes great use of the music of that period, such as &quot;We've Only Just Begun&quot; and &quot;Afternoon Delight,&quot; to add a ironic counterpoint to the proceedings.",4,There is actually more to this film that the ultra-cool car,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,3227,"['quot', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'quot', 'expectations', 'have', 'admit', 'have', 'been', 'lowered', 'considerably', 'when', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'recycling', 'old', 'television', 'perhaps', 'be', 'expected', 'when', 'understand', 'target', 'audience', 'films', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'probably', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'quot', 'Spy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'quot', 'who', 'are', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'familiar', 'famous', 'poster', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'single', 'episode', 'quot', 'Charlie', 'Angels.', 'quot', '2004', 'comedy', 'two', 'advantages.First', 'rich', 'tradition', 'buddy', 'films', 'where', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'person', 'quot', 'bad', 'quot', 'person', 'team', 'up', 'overcome', 'differences', 'work', 'together', 'extending', 'back', 'Riggs', 'Murtaugh', 'Butch', 'Sundance', 'way', 'back', 'Katie', 'Scarlet', 'Miss', 'Melly', 'quot', 'Starsky', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hutch', 'quot', 'tried', 'true', 'formula', 'mainly', 'tweaking', 'key', 'thing', 'film', 'idea', 'same', 'time', 'lampooning', 'things', 'considered', 'gentle', 'comedy', 'telling', 'story', 'how', 'Starksy', 'Hutch', 'came', 'meet', 'even', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'bringing', 'something', 'edge', 'Huggy', 'Bear.Second', 'pretty', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'should', 'sixth', 'film', 'together', 'fact', 'most', 'chemistry', 'Stiller', 'shown', 'anybody', 'one', 'films', 'worked', 'DeNiro', 'Stiller', 'helped', 'fact', 'Starsky', 'go', 'top', 'still', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'keep', 'thinking', 'make', 'fool', 'certainly', 'direction', 'things', 'never', 'get', 'so', 'far', 'hand', 'just', 'big', 'joke.The', 'big', 'joke', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'plan', 'bad', 'guy', 'Reese', 'Feldman', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'invented', 'former', 'cocaine', 'even', 'German', 'shepherds', 'can', 'not', 'detect', 'other', 'words', 'Feldman', 'invented', 'wait', 'new', 'Coke.', 'quot', 'plot', 'merely', 'excuse', 'Stiller', 'Wilson', 'do', 'scenes', 'together', 'spirit', 'true', 'partnership', 'humiliated', 'turn', 'such', 'when', 'jailhouse', 'snitch', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Hutch', 'show', 'belly', 'button', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'weird', 'then', 'get', 'humiliated', 'together', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'end', 'Feldman', 'going', 'down', 'going', 'down', 'hard', 'man', 'plot', 'not', 'point', 'Furthermore', 'supporting', 'case', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'Fred', 'Williamson', 'Captain', 'Dobey', 'pretty', 'good', 'sort', 'film.Plus', 'have', 'Starsky', 'beloved', 'bright-red', 'supercharged', 'Ford', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'crazy', 'person', 'then', 'becomes', 'incensed', 'thought', 'might', 'get', 'scratched', 'dented', 'homage', 'original', 'consists', 'requisite', 'appearance', 'Paul', 'Michael', 'Glaser', 'David', 'Soul', 'as', 'well', 'Wilson', 'warbling', 'Soul', 'one', 'hit', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Give', 'Up', 'Us', 'Baby', 'quot', 'joke', 'going', 'be', 'lost', 'most', 'viewers', 'Actually', 'film', 'director', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'great', 'use', 'music', 'period', 'such', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'Only', 'Just', 'Begun', 'quot', 'quot', 'Afternoon', 'Delight', 'quot', 'add', 'ironic', 'counterpoint', 'proceedings']",Starsky & Hutch VHS

In this film, Ben Stiller plays David Starsky and Owen Wilson plays Ken Hutchinson (Hutch), a pair of cops in the free wheeling, psychedelic haze of the nineteen seventies. Both are viewed as problem children by their superior officer and, consequently, are teamed up as partners. The film is really about how Starsky and Hutch met and became partners, something the television series never addressed.Ben Stiller is his usually wacky self as the straight arrow, by the book Starsky, while Owen Wilson positively shines as the laid back, irrepressible Hutch.  Owen Wilson's natural comedic gifts allow him to effortlessly steal every scene in which he is featured. He is positively infectious! Snoop Dogg does a good job of reprising the role of Huggy Bear, the street informant that keeps Starsky and Hutch in the loop in terms of criminal activity afoot. Snoop Dogg infuses the role with a sort of natural cool and is funny in his own way, though not as endearing as the original Huggy Bear was in the television series. Still, he makes the role his own, as do Stiller and Wilson with theirs.The movie has a silly plot involving cocaine dealer/business man Reese Feldman, played by Vince Vaughn, who injects the character with  just the right amount of sleaze. It appears that Feldman has just come up with a new cocaine that will fool any drug sniffing canine. It is left up to Starsky and Hutch to stop his nefarious scheme, but not without getting themselves involved in some nutty situations along the way.  Look for Justin Bateman in the small role of Friday, Feldman's sidekick. Will Ferrell has a small, but pivotal, role as Big Earl, a guy with a dragon fetish who has some information that Starsky and Hutch need badly enough to...well, see the film. Carmen Electra, Amy Smart, and Juliette Lewis round out the cast and provide the babe factor.The film is a retro look at the nineteen seventies from its fashions to its  music. Look for cameo appearances by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. To my surprise, Glaser looks a whole lot better than David Soul, who appears not to have aged well. As to the overall rating of this film, I realize that this film may have limited appeal.

824742,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00024JC3U,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","I think the best word for ""Starsky and Hutch"" is 'serviceable'. It's reasonably funny, decently acted and directed, and, all and all, an entertaining way to spend an evening. It's neither the best nor the worst work the team of Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller have done. [This is their sixth movie together.] One doesn't have to have any knowledge of the ancient TV series it is based on to enjoy it.Starsky [Stiller] and Hutch [Wilson] are two renegade cops who belong together. When first made partners, they don't much like each other, but, after awhile, they begin to care for each other in a classic 'male bonding' way. Their first big case involves a drug dealer [Vince Vaughn], who has figured out a novel way to smuggle and transport cocaine. As is always true in movies like this, they are stymied by the 'system' in pursuing their man, but they figure out 'novel' ways to overcome this problem. [Their 'novel' ways would land them in jail in real life!]The moviemakers wisely chose to make ""Starsky and Hutch"" a satire of the 70s rather than a replication of the TV show - a show most people only vaguely remember anyway.Some of the gags work, while others fall flat.

824743,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B00024JC3U,M. Burns,"[3, 3]","I remember having a discussion with a friend, once, about people in high school and how there are three groups of them - (1) the ones you hate, (2) your friends, and then the third group: the people that you could live without, but you simply don't have the energy to actively dislike them...so you're nice to 'em. Watching Starsky and Hutch last night, I realized that those three groups totally apply to movies, also - filth like Welcome To Mooseport easily falls into that first category, masterful cinema like The Passion slides into the second one, and then...well...stuff like Starsky and Hutch goes right into that third category. Unlike director Todd Philips' earlier films, Road Trip and Old School, there's a sweet, harmless quality to Hutch that, even though I can't say I loved it, I enjoyed myself.The '70's cop show isn't so much parodied in the movie but used as a springboard to pair Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, who - with the right project (The Royal Tenenbaums) - can rock. It's kind of a Felix and Oscar cliche, but Stiller's Starsky is the fastidious, by-the-book cop and Wilson's Hutch just knows a little too much about cocaine. The movie predates the show, imagining how the two got together and then throwing them into various situations that sometimes score and other times fall completely flat. Snoop Dog's bit part as Huggy Bear just didn't do anything for me - usually, that '70's blaxploitation schtick is hilarious (i.e. Undercover Brother or anything on Chapelle's Show), but he fits in like an afterthought, the director trying to pull to another demographic. What does work, though, is a great scene where Starsky accidentally ingests cocaine and excitedly enters a disco contest. Or an undercover bit near the end of the film that you might have caught in the trailer (remember the horse in the garage?). I'll admit, I almost needed a catheter in certain scenes.Then again, S&H; can just be kind of stagnant at times, desperately attempting to be funny and not succeeding. Stretches of the movie were laughless and restlessness sets in...BUT - as much as I want to dislike this movie, I just can't. At the end, when the movie could have committed the carnal sin of overkill, it ends before it wears out its welcome. Nothing in it is really offensive, tasteless, or awful, and that's a rarity in buddy comedies these days. Stiller is looking more and more like a star in every movie he does, too (the vomit-worthy Along Came Polly notwithstanding) - most of the comedy in the movie is thanks to his awesome talent for playing off of that faux-macho persona that works so well for him. And then Will Ferrell - ahh, Will. Where do I start? The man is a riot, and a cameo that he has may as well be the single funniest scene of the whole film (he gets the privelige of alluding to the homoerotic speculation that was rampant during Starsky's run in the '70's).When TV show rehashes are done correctly, they can be brilliant (look at the genius Brady Bunch parody), and when they're done wrong, they can be freaking awful (Leave it to Beaver), but Starsky and Hutch is really neither.

824755,A2ZTB8EDDR8RGW,B00024JC3U,Penguin Egg,"[1, 1]","Starsky and Hutch gaining cult status - who would have thought it? I remember the original tv series during the 70s. It was okay. Nothing special. Quite frankly, The Streets of San Francisco was better. However, Starsky and Hutch are as 70s as disco music, and I suppose that gives it a certain retro appeal. I watched this film with certain misgivings and those misgivings were certainly justified. Although the original series always had a nice balance between action and humour, this film is played strictly for laughs and make the two characters out to be a couple of idiots. It's almost like a remake of a Laurel and Hardy film. Some homage! They also get the character of Huggy Bear completely wrong. In the series, he is on the skirts of criminal activity and he makes a little extra money by informing the police. However, in the movie, he is a successful crime boss who has no need to make a little extra money, especially as being a police snitch would seriously jeopardise his reputation - something he would have to be stupid to do. I should also point out that Snoopy Dogg -Christ, what a name! How on earth does that give him any street cred? - cannot act to save his life. Not since David Bowie's performance in ""Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence "" has there been such a lamentable lack of talent and charisma on the screen. He does not so much act the part as read his lines out loud. After saying all that, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson do have a certain chemistry between them and the film is quite fun to watch.

Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson team up in this modern-day look back of one of America's classic buddy cop series.  I've never seen the original Starsky and Hutch episodes, but seeing this really makes me want to.  As Stiller and Wilson assume the roles made famous by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul, they investigate the murder of a drug pusher and try to prove that a much larger conspiracy is in the making.  They joined by many others from the ""brat pack"", none of whom overdo it in the humor departments they are so well known for.  Somehow Will Ferrell, appearing in an uncredited cameo, manages to be both over-the-top bizarre and under-the-bottom restrained...watch the movie to see what I mean...his performance just works.  But my favorite in this film is Snoop Dogg, who plays Huggy Bear, the leading duo's ""urban informer"" who later reluctantly upgrades to a more hands-on role in the investigation.  He is just hilarious all the way through.  I especially like his first reaction to Starsky's Ford Gran Torino.  Overall, this is a buddy cop movie that, along with the series it is based off of, is the sort of thing all buddy cop movies should try to achieve.  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson have a great chemistry throughout, even making it work when they don't know and/or like each other.

I was sure I would be rolling my eyes and cringing throughout the whole movie.  Well, I would find myself cringing a few times (simply from a few scenes of embarrasing humor), but would only roll my eyes once, the ending.  Now, normally if a movie has a bad ending, I'd slam it, because the end of a movie normally makes or breaks a film, but not in S&H;'s case, this is actually a very enjoyable, good humoured, and even at times uproarious comedy.There is one scene in this movie that for me, goes down in the history books for one of the funniest comedic sequences of all time. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson come barging in an apartment to catch a sniper.  The apartment is occupied by an older man and his son.  They grab the father as the kid does cartwheels and flips out of the room and behind the kitchen counter.  From there, knives come flying out from behind the counter, wreaking havoc in the room and as Wilson and Stiller try to dodge the flying cutlery, the father eggs his son on, speaking in Chinese (I think) telling him to throw more of what and when.  It brought tears to my eyes.The first half of this movie, though distinctly slap-stick, is generally enjoyable and even funny at times, however, the nearer you get to the end of the movie the worse things become.  As usual, in the ridiculously goofy action/comedy flicks that Hollywood makes, there's an amazingly overblown finale that is not fun, interesting, realistic, funny, and without any of those qualities, it fails miserably short of being enjoyable.  Oh well, it could have been worse.  It could have been much worse.  This movie had the potential to be genuinely painful to sit through, but amazingly, I found myself having fun and getting the first decent laugh I'd had in a long time.SUMMARYThis movie is really worthy of ***1/2 stars, but I've given it the benefit of the doubt with four stars, because in all honesty and against every ounce of my better judgement, I like this movie!  I don't normally like slap-stick humor of any kind, and I'm not an Owen Wilson fan either, but ""Starsky and Hutch"" managed to make itself fun for even me, so, I suppose that's the sign of at least a decent movie.",4,Surprisingly Funny.,1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,2294,"['When', 'was', 'dragged', 'theatre', 'see', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'few', 'friends', 'mine', 'expected', 'worst', 'was', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'cringing', 'whole', 'movie', 'Well', 'would', 'find', 'cringing', 'few', 'times', 'simply', 'few', 'scenes', 'embarrasing', 'humor', 'would', 'only', 'roll', 'eyes', 'once', 'ending', 'Now', 'normally', 'movie', 'bad', 'ending', ""'d"", 'slam', 'end', 'movie', 'normally', 'breaks', 'film', 'not', 'S', 'H', 'case', 'actually', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'humoured', 'even', 'times', 'uproarious', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'down', 'history', 'books', 'one', 'funniest', 'comedic', 'sequences', 'time', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'come', 'barging', 'apartment', 'catch', 'sniper', 'apartment', 'occupied', 'older', 'man', 'son', 'grab', 'father', 'kid', 'cartwheels', 'room', 'kitchen', 'counter', 'there', 'come', 'flying', 'out', 'counter', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'room', 'Wilson', 'Stiller', 'try', 'dodge', 'flying', 'cutlery', 'father', 'eggs', 'son', 'speaking', 'Chinese', 'think', 'telling', 'throw', 'more', 'what', 'when', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'though', 'distinctly', 'slap-stick', 'generally', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'funny', 'times', 'however', 'nearer', 'get', 'end', 'movie', 'worse', 'things', 'become', 'usual', 'ridiculously', 'goofy', 'action/comedy', 'flicks', 'Hollywood', 'amazingly', 'overblown', 'finale', 'not', 'fun', 'interesting', 'realistic', 'funny', 'qualities', 'miserably', 'short', 'being', 'enjoyable', 'Oh', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'worse', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'genuinely', 'painful', 'sit', 'amazingly', 'found', 'having', 'fun', 'getting', 'first', 'decent', 'laugh', ""'d"", 'had', 'long', 'time.SUMMARYThis', 'movie', 'really', 'worthy', '***1/2', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'given', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'four', 'stars', 'honesty', 'ounce', 'better', 'judgement', 'like', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'slap-stick', 'humor', 'kind', ""'m"", 'not', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'fan', 'either', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'managed', 'make', 'fun', 'even', 'so', 'suppose', 'sign', 'least', 'decent', 'movie']",Starsky & Hutch VHS

Zwick,"[0, 0]","""Starsky and Hutch"" is a genuine surprise, a clever and funny sendup of not only the popular TV series from the 1970's but all those cop-buddy scenarios that have flooded screens both large and small for decades now.  The convention in these tales is to take two cops with diametrically opposed personalities and team them up as fearless crime fighters.  Thus, we have Starsky, the stuffy, by-the-book, idealistic cop who takes his job seriously and actually believes he is making the streets safe for law-abiding, paired up with Hutch, a laid-back, cynical pragmatist who has no illusions about the nobility of his profession and no qualms about bending the rules when he sees the chance of getting a little personal gain out of it.""Starsky and Hutch"" has a great time poking fun at the cliches of its genre, never taking itself or the era in which it is set too seriously.  In fact, the movie does a fine job satirizing the fashions, trends and music of the 1970's in all their kitschy, tacky glory.  In a clever in-joke, the movie has Hutch singing an acoustic version of ""Don't Give Up On Us,"" the sappy number one hit recorded by the original Hutch, David Soul, in 1977.Of the actors, Ben Stiller steals the show as Starsky, bringing to the character a quality of deadpan seriousness that makes him a sympathetic figure even as he becomes more and more the butt of the movie's jokes.  The screenplay spins many a convention of the cop buddy movie on its head.  For instance, invariably in these films, one of the cops has a father who distinguished himself years earlier as a model officer on the force, and now his rookie son has to live up to the family reputation.  In this case, however, it is Starsky's MOTHER who set the standard for bravery and courage in the precinct and Starksy knows he cannot let her memory down.Owen Wilson is somewhat less effective as Hutch, mainly because the character has been conceived as essentially the same wisecracking slacker Wilson plays in virtually all his movies.  Still, the two actors generate an effective rapport on the screen, one that helps us over some of the rough spots that set in from time to time.  For indeed, the movie, like most big screen comedies, can't sustain the hilarity through the entirety of its running time.  Nevertheless, ""Starsky and Hutch"" does a better job than most at making us laugh and does so without ever insulting our intelligence.

And the car is back (though it seems like they crunched about a dozen or so Gran Torino's in making this movie).  Set in the fictional ""Bay City"" (though it still looks as much LA as any of those cop shows supposedly set in NYC), ""Starsky & Hutch"" has our heroes working together for the first time to take down a crime lord (Vince Vaughn) set to flood the city with a new form of cocaine utterly undetectable by police dogs.  Will they be forced to rely on a local ""businessman"" named ""Huggy Bear"" (Snoop Dogg)?  You bet!  Will they earn the wrath of their Captain (Fred Williamson)?  You got it!  Will they be torn apart, yet rise above it and learn to work as a team?  No problem.  S&H is good clean fun - aside from a knife-throwing kid, a three-way kissing match between Hutch & 2 cheerleaders, a near case of ""Russian Roulette"" and a disco-dance challenge that goes bad.  The jokes are fun, but it's a thin movie - sort of like a stretched version of the ""Sabotage"" video done nearly a decade ago, in which all the hazards and professional hurdles of being an LAPD detective were compressed into a few minutes.  None of the jokes are that new - and most of them are sight gags (the ridiculous size of electronics, old cars and hair-dos, and how the cool people of the time look incredibly stupid and unattractive).  Though it hails from the same TV era as ""Charlie's Angels"" it's not quite as energized as either of the two ""Angels"" movies, could have used some more car-chases, but it's still a load of fun.",4,Fun,1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,1740,"['march', 'Seventies', 'latest', 'attempt', 'update', 'otherwise', 'dramatic', 'period', 'show', 'outright', 'comedy', 'Stiller', 'Starsky', 'man', 'natural', 'perm', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'sensitive', 'Hutch', 'car', 'back', 'crunched', 'dozen', 'so', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'making', 'movie', 'Set', 'fictional', 'Bay', 'City', 'still', 'as', 'much', 'LA', 'cop', 'shows', 'supposedly', 'set', 'NYC', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'heroes', 'working', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'take', 'down', 'crime', 'lord', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'set', 'flood', 'city', 'new', 'form', 'cocaine', 'utterly', 'undetectable', 'police', 'dogs', 'Will', 'be', 'forced', 'rely', 'local', 'businessman', 'named', 'Huggy', 'Bear', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'bet', 'Will', 'earn', 'wrath', 'Captain', 'Fred', 'Williamson', 'got', 'Will', 'be', 'torn', 'apart', 'yet', 'rise', 'learn', 'work', 'team', 'problem', 'S', 'H', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'aside', 'knife-throwing', 'kid', 'three-way', 'kissing', 'match', 'Hutch', '2', 'cheerleaders', 'near', 'case', 'Russian', 'Roulette', 'disco-dance', 'challenge', 'bad', 'jokes', 'are', 'fun', 'thin', 'movie', 'sort', 'stretched', 'version', 'Sabotage', 'video', 'done', 'nearly', 'decade', 'ago', 'hazards', 'professional', 'hurdles', 'being', 'LAPD', 'detective', 'were', 'compressed', 'few', 'minutes', 'None', 'jokes', 'are', 'new', 'most', 'are', 'sight', 'gags', 'ridiculous', 'size', 'electronics', 'old', 'cars', 'hair-dos', 'how', 'cool', 'people', 'time', 'look', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'unattractive', 'same', 'TV', 'era', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'energized', 'two', 'Angels', 'movies', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'car-chases', 'still', 'load', 'fun']",Starsky & Hutch VHS

Even so, I was expecting to have a good time, enjoying the antics of our dynamic duo, but instead I found this film eyeball rollingly CHEESY. Stiller overacts each and every scene and looks ridiculous with the curly hair. Wilson is good as Hutch, but comes off as too much of a black sheep. These  characters were just too inept to be believed. The best scenes by far are those which included ""Huggy Bear"" played by Snoop Dog.The plot? Hardly worth mentioning, but Starsky and Hutch are after a dealer who sells 'odorless coke.'

Dobey(Fred Williamson).The story centers around 2 cops who eagerly work for the Bay City Police Dept. in a city that has distinct Southern California atmosphere to it, especially since Bay City is very similar to L.A.Additionally, this movie also made and formatted everything to look exactly like things did back in the 1970's, including cars, hairstyles, clothing, music, disco, etc., plus they played a lot of popular oldies from the 70's like ""Use Me"" by Bill Withers, ""Back Where We Started From"" by Maxine Nightengale, ""We've Only Just Begun"" by The Carpenters, ""Cocaine"" by Eric Clapton, ""That's The Way I Like It"" by KC & The Sunshine Band, ""Afternoon Delight"" by Starland Vocal, etc.It was also cool how in the last scene Huggy Bear surprises Starsky by buying him another Torino from the original Starsky & Hutch duo meeting face-to-face with the new duo when Paul Michael Glaser reluctantly gives the keys to the new Torino to Ben Stiller showing us that Glaser & Soul were obviously too old to do this flick with their wrinkles & gray hairs & that Stiller & Wilson were a more compatible choice to do this movie since Wilson & Stiller are as young as Soul & Glaser were during the series whole 4-year run on ABC.This movie also takes me back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 2003-2004 when George Bush, Jr. was still the president and Senator John Kerry lost the election in November of 2004.",5,Starsky & Hutch Rocks!,1227139200,"11 20, 2008",2008,2427,"['action', 'comedy', 'drama', 'movie', 'STARSKY', 'HUTCH', '2', 'streetwise', 'undercover', 'cops', 'fictional', 'city', 'Bay', 'City', 'California', '1975', 'who', 'drive', 'around', 'red', ""'74"", 'Ford', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'bust', 'criminals', 'help', 'underworld', 'Huggy-Bear', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'movie', 'functions', 'sort', 'prequel', 'TV', 'series', 'ran', 'ABC', '1975-79', 'when', 'Dave', 'Starsky', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'was', 'first', 'partnered', 'Ken', 'Hutchinson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'movie', 'also', 'personalities', 'title', 'characters.For', 'instance', 'TV', 'series', 'Starsky', 'Paul', 'Michael', 'Glaser', 'was', 'always', 'curious', 'streetwise', 'Hutch', 'was', 'more', 'tough', 'by-the-book', 'police', 'officer', 'movie', 'Starsky', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'loudmouth', 'wannabe', 'macho', 'cop', 'Hutch', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'cool', 'laid-back', 'easy-going', 'detective', '2', 'are', 'wary', 'other', 'beginning', 'when', 'duo', 'reluctantly', 'assigned', 'be', 'partners', 'hard-nosed', 'superior', 'officer', 'Capt', 'Dobey', 'Fred', 'Williamson', '.The', 'story', 'centers', '2', 'cops', 'who', 'eagerly', 'work', 'Bay', 'City', 'Police', 'Dept', 'city', 'distinct', 'Southern', 'California', 'atmosphere', 'especially', 'Bay', 'City', 'very', 'similar', 'L.A.Additionally', 'movie', 'also', 'made', 'formatted', 'everything', 'look', 'exactly', 'things', 'did', 'back', '1970', 'including', 'cars', 'hairstyles', 'clothing', 'music', 'disco', 'etc.', 'played', 'lot', 'popular', 'oldies', '70', 'Use', 'Me', 'Bill', 'Withers', 'Back', 'Where', 'Started', 'From', 'Maxine', 'Nightengale', ""'ve"", 'Only', 'Just', 'Begun', 'Carpenters', 'Cocaine', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Way', 'KC', 'Sunshine', 'Band', 'Afternoon', 'Delight', 'Starland', 'Vocal', 'etc.It', 'was', 'also', 'cool', 'how', 'last', 'scene', 'Huggy', 'Bear', 'surprises', 'Starsky', 'buying', 'Torino', 'original', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'duo', 'meeting', 'face-to-face', 'new', 'duo', 'when', 'Paul', 'Michael', 'Glaser', 'reluctantly', 'keys', 'new', 'Torino', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'showing', 'Glaser', 'Soul', 'were', 'obviously', 'too', 'old', 'do', 'flick', 'wrinkles', 'gray', 'hairs', 'Stiller', 'Wilson', 'were', 'more', 'compatible', 'choice', 'do', 'movie', 'Wilson', 'Stiller', 'are', 'as', 'young', 'Soul', 'Glaser', 'were', 'series', 'whole', '4-year', 'run', 'ABC.This', 'movie', 'also', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'had', 'budget', 'cuts', 'going', 'recession', 'had', 'back', '2003-2004', 'when', 'George', 'Bush', 'Jr.', 'was', 'still', 'president', 'Senator', 'John', 'Kerry', 'lost', 'election', 'November', '2004']",Starsky & Hutch VHS

Maniacally devoted to his job, when he's on duty no crime goes unpunished, and he's always on duty. And that's a good thing, because he has some metaphorically big shoes to fill: his mother was a legend on the force, one of the best cops in the history of Bay City. But while his mom stuck with the same partner throughout her entire career, due to his extremely zealous brand of police work, Starsky burns through partners faster than his beloved Gran Torino goes through spark plugs. Detective Ken ""Hutch"" Hutchinson is having career issues of his own, he's a good cop, but his hazardously laidback personality and desire for a quick buck don't always get the job done.

824781,ACVLLA37BN9KY,B00024JC3U,Valjean,"[1, 1]","If you are expecting a send-up of the classic 1970's cop-show with side-splitting humor, that's not what you're gonna get. Instead, this movie remake of Starsky and Hutch places the emphasis on action and, as such, is more of an action flick than a comedy. Although this might not be what you'd expect from a movie with Stiller and Wilson, an excellent storyline and well-developed characters make this movie a real pleasure to watch.The storyline involves the two detectives on the case of a drug-dealer who has a formula that makes cocaine undetectable. This particular concept is thoughtful and highly original. Starsky (Stller) and Hutch (Wilson) rely on underworld connection, Huggy Bear (played gracefully by Snoop Dogg) and detective work to put the pieces together. And, while a lot of the detective work is silly, it won't have you rolling on the floor like some of Stiller and Wilson's previous outings.I would point out, however, that if you are a Starsky and Hutch &quot;purist&quot; (if there is such a thing?) that quite a few liberties were taken with some characters. First off, while the Dogg plays Huggy Bear as some kind of underworld kingpin, I remember the original Huggy Bear as being more of a street-urchin. Kind of a low-class hustler. Also, I remember the original Hutch (David Soul), as being more sullen and brooding as opposed to the laid-back way that Wilson plays Hutch.These liberties taken with the characters still do not detract from the movie in any way. The only original character that is true to form is Doby, who would always chew-out Starsky and Hutch for unorthodox police work.There is plenty action here, which is the movie's strongsuit. Firefights, carchases and undercover work add excitement to the mix. Ultimatley, the movie is highly enjoyable. At one point, Starsky even tries to &quot;land&quot; the famous red Gran Torino on a yacht (don't ask).I would, however, point out that the Anal-Retentive Cop and the laid-back partner is not 100% original. The same plan was used in the 1980's remake of Dragnet featuring Tom Hanks and Dan Ackroyd. For that I would deduct a half-star. Another half-star is taken away from the general lack of focus on the 1970's settings. I really can't explain this, except by saying that some movies (ie: Boogie Nights) genuinely make you &quot;feel&quot; like you're back in the 70's. Just like the &quot;Doors&quot; made you feel like you were in the 60's. Anyway, I digress. An enjoyable, if not lampoonish movie. 4 stars.",4,More Action than Comedy,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,2505,"['are', 'expecting', 'send-up', 'classic', '1970', 'cop-show', 'side-splitting', 'humor', 'not', 'what', ""'re"", 'gon', 'get', 'Instead', 'movie', 'remake', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'emphasis', 'action', 'such', 'more', 'action', 'flick', 'comedy', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'movie', 'Stiller', 'Wilson', 'excellent', 'storyline', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'make', 'movie', 'real', 'pleasure', 'watch.The', 'storyline', 'two', 'detectives', 'case', 'drug-dealer', 'who', 'formula', 'cocaine', 'undetectable', 'particular', 'concept', 'thoughtful', 'highly', 'original', 'Starsky', 'Stller', 'Hutch', 'Wilson', 'rely', 'underworld', 'connection', 'Huggy', 'Bear', 'played', 'gracefully', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'detective', 'work', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'lot', 'detective', 'work', 'silly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'rolling', 'floor', 'Stiller', 'Wilson', 'previous', 'outings.I', 'would', 'point', 'out', 'however', 'are', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'quot', 'purist', 'quot', 'such', 'thing', 'quite', 'few', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'characters', 'First', 'off', 'Dogg', 'Huggy', 'Bear', 'kind', 'underworld', 'kingpin', 'remember', 'original', 'Huggy', 'Bear', 'being', 'more', 'street-urchin', 'Kind', 'low-class', 'hustler', 'Also', 'remember', 'original', 'Hutch', 'David', 'Soul', 'being', 'more', 'sullen', 'brooding', 'as', 'opposed', 'laid-back', 'way', 'Wilson', 'Hutch.These', 'liberties', 'taken', 'characters', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'movie', 'way', 'only', 'original', 'character', 'true', 'form', 'Doby', 'who', 'would', 'always', 'chew-out', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'unorthodox', 'police', 'plenty', 'action', 'here', 'movie', 'strongsuit', 'Firefights', 'carchases', 'undercover', 'work', 'add', 'excitement', 'mix', 'Ultimatley', 'movie', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'point', 'Starsky', 'even', 'quot', 'land', 'quot', 'famous', 'red', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'yacht', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', '.I', 'would', 'however', 'point', 'out', 'Anal-Retentive', 'Cop', 'laid-back', 'partner', 'not', '100', '%', 'original', 'same', 'plan', 'was', 'used', '1980', 'remake', 'Dragnet', 'featuring', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', 'would', 'deduct', 'half-star', 'half-star', 'taken', 'away', 'general', 'lack', 'focus', '1970', 'settings', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'saying', 'movies', 'ie', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'genuinely', 'make', 'quot', 'feel', 'quot', ""'re"", 'back', '70', 'Just', 'quot', 'Doors', 'quot', 'made', 'feel', 'were', '60', 'Anyway', 'digress', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'lampoonish', 'movie', '4', 'stars']",Starsky & Hutch VHS

""Starsky and Hutch"" is well written and directed with a stellar cast including Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in the title roles and featuring Vince Vaughan, Jason Bateman, Carmen Electra and a hilarious performance from the great Fred Williamson as the police captain. Some examples of the hilarity: Starsky and Hutch's captain (Williamson) regularly calls the boys on the carpet using hilarious profanity over their misguided efforts at law enforcement. Starsky tries to convince a suspect to confess using a fake game of Russian roulette. What Starsky doesn't know is that there's really a bullet in the gun (and the suspect speaks Korean and can't warn him). Starsky and Hutch go to arrest a suspect not realizing that his kid is a knife-throwing martial artist - the kid's dad keeps yelling to the kid in Korean ""throw more knives."" And perhaps the most hilarious of all: a disco dance off between Starsky and some overweight king of ""Saturday Night Fever"". Starsky is high on cocaine, which he thought was sweetener and poured into his coffee. There's much, much more. The 70's setting and music are terrific. The stunt driving and other action is great. I was never a real fan of the series, but I loved this take-off. And yes, the original Starsky and Hutch have a cameo. Oh, and Snoop Dogg is perfect as Huggy Bear. The extras include a fashion show by Snoop, explaining the 70's pimpwear worn by Huggy. Highly recommended.",5,"Ben Stiller, Disco King!

Stiller makes this film with his dry humor. Playing opposite Stiller is Owen Wilson who creates a new Hutch. Wilson is quirky and somehow sexy in a very funny way. These two actors make a brand new comedy team and you won't be disappointed in this film if you enjoy the way they tag team off one another for a laugh. Of course Snoop Dog does a great job as Huggy Bear too and the red and white Grand Terino takes on the original car with a few new tricks!This movie is a great laugh and an evening of nostalgia for people who grew up watching the original series. Many scenes are re-created almost to a perfect tee! The 70's clothing deserves a shout out as well! The only negative aspect I found was in the dimwitted women, like Carmen Electra, who dance across the screen every now and then without much meaning.

Scooby-Doo did it, and- sorry if you were in the process of wiping this one out of your memory- The Avengers did too. But somehow Starsky And Hutch avoids remake clich&eacute;s by revelling in the irony goldmine left vacant by the TV show.Top marks go to the casters for revolving the film around trusted comedy performers rather than straight-faced, perfectly groomed Hollywood big-shots. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson- who tickled the world together in Zoolander and The Royal Tenembaums- have now perfected the geeky, uptight but loveable goon and laid-back chick magnet. Snoop Dogg has a go at stealing the show in his 15 minutes of screen time as Huggy Bear- a role he seems to have spent his whole life emulating.Despite the absence of a Wilson writing credit, the script strikes a balance of comedy and wisely simple plot.
