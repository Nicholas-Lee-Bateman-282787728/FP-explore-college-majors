Sadly, talent like Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock are wasted on a script that lathers on clich&eacute;s and plot holes (nonsensical is an understatement) with rusty dialog, little laughs (why is Chris Rock in this movie if he's not allowed to be funny) and regurgitated familiarity.  Sure, there are some thrills, but they are far too expected and they only get you once, then you're over it.  Hopkins does the best he can here, and his presence certainly gives the film a much needed facelift, but at the end of the day this is a forgettable ride.

If any of these are familiar, so much the better (e.g., Tony Scott).  First of all, the pairing of Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock was simply a surprise.  The soundtrack is excellent (and who cares if any of it was used before?).  It begins as what looks like a fairly serious film (several killings in Prague) and then BAM! it is a comedy.  If they spent any time showing how they figured out that Michael Turner (Kevin Pope's alias) had a twin brother (the husling Jake Hayes) it would have spoiled the film completely.Much of the hilarity and charm of this film comes from that BAM--and it comes through.  Does anyone expect Anthony Hopkins to be anything but dry as an FBI Agent?  I mean, his boss, after all, seems to be 30 years younger than him.  Why is he taking orders?  Why does he have a crew of geeky 30-somethings to handle, as well as groom Jake Hayes for a critical job?It isn't perfect.

717882,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00006JDVT,Eric,"[2, 3]","Bad Company is still slightly better than Gone in Sixty Seconds, but the point is, producer Jerry Bruckheimer is churning out crap at an alarmingly fast rate. And with Kangaroo Jack out, he's not slowing down this trend whatsoever (2001's Black Hawk Down proved to be a fluke on his part). The man truly doesn't know a good script when he sees one, and the odd part is, he typically hires decent directors and to helm these pictures, which typically follow a specific formula. You got your heroes on one side, the despicable villains on the other, a countdown clock, and lots of stuff getting shot up real good.Bruckheimer also knows how to draw in A-list actors. Anthony Hopkins is in this film. Anthony Hopkins! And he's paired with Chris Rock, who plays twins here, though the more refined, cultured one is killed off early on, and the plot has to do with the more street-wise half having to pose as his CIA sibling to make a transaction involving a nuclear bomb go smoothly. Hopkins plays his trainer, so you can see the filmmakers were opting for a mismatched buddy picture.But the point is, there's very little about this movie worth mentioning. The premise is silly, but good action movies can be made from a lack of strong plot, right? Last year there was the wonderfully entertaining The Transporter. But no, Bad Company fails from the start because it brings nothing new to the proceedings. Everything is bland and predictable, all the way down to the perfunctory shootouts. The only bright spot is an energetic car chase, but even that is marred by Rock's awful one-liners and Hopkins' unconvincing bid as an action hero.Hopkins and Rock display little to no chemistry. I cannot remember laughing once during the entire film, nor do I recall anything in the way of thrills, excitement, or fun.

No, this is not the tightest script written, and yes, the story has been done before, but in a field as repetitious as Hollywood products variations on a theme are bound to occur.  Joel Schumacher has a style which includes a love affair with light and dark, with angles of view that distort and sharpen our perception, and he always seems to generate the feeling from his actors that htey are having one terific time working with him.  It is refreshing to see Anthony Hopkins take on a bit of a fluff role, taking the script seriously that he is playing a burned out CIA agent, and spar with Chris Rock (who is always just Chris Rock...not a bad thing.....).  As usual Schumacher introduces fresh faces in minor roles and gathers some of the more interesting new lights around in a full scale production.

Hopkins has made a career of playing the suave gentleman, whether he is the erudite if not the monomanical Hannibal Lechter or the self-effacing butler from REMAINS OF THE DAY.  In BAD COMPANY, however his sense of urbane self is totally lost as he is a CIA operative who recruits a jive Chris Rock to take the place of Rock's twin brother who was killed in a mission to recover a suitcase nuclear bomb.  Director Joel Shumacher clearly attempted to present a cop buddy movie in whose divergent personalities and speech rhythms the audience would surely connect.  In this case, their unlike traits were less believable than those of Toody and Muldoon from CAR 54.The plot, given the events of 9/11, ought to have resonated more than it did to a viewing public that brings terrorist-laden baggage into the theater. Not for a second did I connect the movie plot to detonate a nuclear bomb in Manhattan with the real life worries that appear daily on the evening news.  The film's few laughs came only from Rock's penchant for throwing off some hip hop lines at Hopkins' expense.  Far too much of the story was marked by gunshots, car chases, and slimy eastern Eurotrash terrorist wannabes whose only function seemed to be to snarl directly into the camera.  Had these bald-headed baddies had moustaches, they surely would have twirled them.  And had the writers any original ideas about injecting any oomph into a moribund story, they surely would have done that too.  Since neither event occured, the result is a brainless thriller that fails to thrill.  For those viewers who prefer more in a thriller that features a countdown clock in a suitcase bomb, they would do well to turn to GOLDFINGER.

He's a hustler baby, a DJ, a chess player, and a ticket scalper.  But it still doesn't seem to be enough.  He loves his girl Julie (Kerry Washington) and is sick to death when she tells him she's moving.  I mean seriously what girl wants to live with her sister and family while her man lives in some basement apartment hustling here and there?Okay so as Jake is all lost in love, he goes to sell some tickets and discovers that he had a twin, and now the CIA needs him to workout this major deal for them or else!  So do it for your country?  NOPE!  Do it for your brother? NOPE!  Do it for some dollar-dollar bills?

Someone is desperately trying to prevent Kevin/Michael from making his detrimental meeting in 9 days.  Risking lives, limbs, and whatever else it doesn't take that much for Jakey to realize that he is at risk of loosing more than a couple of dollars.  Now the question is will he stick around to see this mission through and why?This is the part of the film where the main character has grown and is now doing things because he wants a chance to prove people wrong, and he's gained the respect of the person/people who doubted him.

But suprisingly this outing represents one of the better ones of this sort that I have seen. I really like Anthony Hopkins because even though hes such an incredibly accomplished actor he seems to take a lot of risky roles. Hes an serious oscar winner yet hes not afraid of just having a good time with a movie even if it could possibly embarrass him or ruin his career. I think people like that about him, or at least I do. This guy is a heavy weight super star, yet hes game when it comes to choosing some rather unusual scripts. I love the guy. Hes just plain perfect in this role even though its obvious that hes a little on the old side to be running around playing a CIA agent. He still does the job so well you almost believe he could pull it off in reality. Putting him along side hysterical comedic actor Chris Rock is really something interesting to see. Somehow the two of them make a good team despite how unlikely it would be for the chemistry to work. And thanks to some very good funny moments, above average action sequences, intrigue, and an over all very entertaining and stylish kind of production, this movie works better than I really expected it to.

Granted there were some far fetched issues, like Anthony Hopkins running up flights of stairs in no time, but too me this movie was a good action comedy.Chris Rock plays Mike Turner/Jacob Hayes.  As Jacob Hayes, he is a bookie/DJ/hustler who is coming to terms with his ending relationship with Julia who after three years is moving to Seattle to move on with her life.  Jacob is brought into the CIA to help finish a case his now murdered brother Mike Turner was working on.  Agent Oaks has 9 days to make Jacob as polished and knowledge as Hayes to make the mission a success.  Jacob is to help twart a possible suitcase bomb from getting into the wrong hands.  As Mike Hayes he has to speak well, and well act like his brother without blowing the whole case.  Turns out he can mix his street smarts and get over.  He can't fool everybody though.  When Nicole (played by Garcelle Beauvais) she knows right off he is not Mike.  Jacob has to dodge bullets, and is ready to leave the case all together until His girlfriend Juila is kidnapped by the bad guys.The movie had some great action scenes.  Some of the comedic lines were out of place, but the comedic lines that did fit well in the film were funny.  The scene where puts Air supply son ""All out of Love"" on in a club was very, very funny.  Those folks in the club looked like they were about to jump him!!!  Kerry Washington has a bright future if she keeps getting some good roles.  Irma P Hall has a role in the film as Jacob foster mother.  Michael Early also had a very small minor role, so small and minor there was really no sense in him being in the film. The same with Garcelle Beauvais her role was so minor I wondered if it was really necessary.  Aside of that I really enjoyed this film, the movie is predictable at time, but interesting enough to keep you watching.  I would actually rent this again.If you enjoyed Rush Hour, or Enemy of the State then you should enjoy this movie.",3,Better than I anticipated,1089849600,"07 15, 2004",2004,2074,"['reviews', 'heard', 'read', 'was', 'expecting', 'Bad', 'Company', 'be', 'horrible', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'Granted', 'were', 'far', 'fetched', 'issues', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'running', 'up', 'flights', 'stairs', 'time', 'too', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'action', 'comedy.Chris', 'Rock', 'Mike', 'Turner/Jacob', 'Hayes', 'Jacob', 'Hayes', 'bookie/DJ/hustler', 'who', 'coming', 'terms', 'ending', 'relationship', 'Julia', 'who', 'three', 'years', 'moving', 'Seattle', 'move', 'life', 'Jacob', 'brought', 'CIA', 'help', 'finish', 'case', 'now', 'murdered', 'brother', 'Mike', 'Turner', 'was', 'working', 'Agent', 'Oaks', '9', 'days', 'make', 'Jacob', 'polished', 'knowledge', 'Hayes', 'make', 'mission', 'success', 'Jacob', 'help', 'twart', 'possible', 'suitcase', 'bomb', 'getting', 'wrong', 'hands', 'Mike', 'Hayes', 'speak', 'well', 'well', 'act', 'brother', 'blowing', 'whole', 'case', 'out', 'can', 'mix', 'street', 'smarts', 'get', 'over', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fool', 'everybody', 'When', 'Nicole', 'played', 'Garcelle', 'Beauvais', 'right', 'not', 'Mike', 'Jacob', 'dodge', 'bullets', 'ready', 'leave', 'case', 'together', 'girlfriend', 'Juila', 'kidnapped', 'bad', 'guys.The', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'comedic', 'lines', 'were', 'place', 'comedic', 'lines', 'did', 'fit', 'well', 'film', 'were', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Air', 'supply', 'son', 'Love', 'club', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'folks', 'club', 'looked', 'were', 'about', 'jump', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'bright', 'future', 'getting', 'good', 'roles', 'Irma', 'P', 'Hall', 'role', 'film', 'Jacob', 'foster', 'mother', 'Michael', 'Early', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'small', 'minor', 'role', 'small', 'minor', 'was', 'really', 'sense', 'being', 'film', 'same', 'Garcelle', 'Beauvais', 'role', 'was', 'so', 'minor', 'wondered', 'was', 'really', 'necessary', 'Aside', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'movie', 'predictable', 'time', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'would', 'actually', 'rent', 'again.If', 'enjoyed', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'Enemy', 'State', 'then', 'should', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Bad Company

A rival for the bomb kills Rock's character. They need to carry on and it just so happens --surprise!--he has a twin brother that Hopkins never knew about. Chris Rock (again)plays Jake who is enlisted by Hopkins to impersonate his deceased twin. Unless they are able to pull this off, the bomb will fall into the wrong hands (a Yugoslav terrorist)bend on using it in America.All right. There's got to be easier ways to cross the bad guys. Bad Company is an entertaining romp that has its fair share of explosions, gunfire, one-liners and, although it is fun, it isn't as fun as it should be nor as funny. Still, there is a certain chemistry between Hopkins and Rock. Hopkins plays his CIA operative pretty straight. He's a perfect foil for Rock. A pity the material isn't stronger and the plot not overly familiar (well, the portion without the twin).The transfer is very good, the sound terrific and this is fun for a rental but I wouldn't purchase it.
