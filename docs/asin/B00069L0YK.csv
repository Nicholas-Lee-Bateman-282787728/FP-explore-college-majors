In the second season, well most of the field action ceased, and the new ""action"" was the personal hardships faced by the soldiers, love intrested, break downs, some new characters that were out of place, the media and so forth.  What was appealing in the first season lacks heavily in the second season, dont get me wrong, the acting is still top notch but the plots were lame and uninspired.  I am not making blight of the personal issues the soldiers did face, rather the show changed direction as if trying to capture a new audience and left the rest of us just saying ""What the heck just happened here"".

There are VHS tapes out there with better quality picture and sound than this. Sony should be ashamed to release trash like this. The only thing giving this set even 2 stars is the content of the series itself. It still remains a great groundbreaking sereies, but these DVD sets have much to be desired. This series and everyone involved in it's production along with the diehard fans deserve much better than this. Just as an example of how much Sony/CTSE care about this sereies and how much effort they put into these DVD sets, take a close look at the cover photo for season two. If you know anything about the show, or the military for that matter, you will notice that the MAC-V insignia patch is on the wrong shoulder of everyone in the photo, also look closely at the U.S. ARMY strip on Ramon Franco's (Ruiz)right chest and the Devlin name tape on Kim Delaney's (Alex) left chest. See anything wrong? Yeah, that's right, they printed the negative backwards. Gee, they spent alot of time on this one.

I served 3 tours in Viet Nam and what this does not show like all the others, was the smells and oders of the dead and dying ,that is something you can never forget or never describe. The true sounds of the war. What it felt like to see your best friend in pieces on the ground. I to was a Volenteer, and came back 3 times total, not because I loved it but I was young dumb and single. I really thought I could save a Dad with kids from going over. War is War I won't go into the details this missed or was right about it. When I came back from my last tour I was in the Hospital For over a Year. During the last few month I was able to leave the hospital for afew hours, that I loved , what I hated we were not allowed to wear our uniforms off base. Seems they were offencive to many of the locals. The things that went on in that country cost me alot , my first heart attack at 29, 3 bouts with cancer, at 61 I can bearly walk, but that is ok I am better off then many. For many many year I hate what the war did to me and others , I hated the way We were treated when we came home, I hate the fact that many more died after coming home from everything for cancer to taking their own lives. For year I could not stand watching how good the troops were treated when they were coming home from other wars, I felt cheat again, I was jealous. Two weeks ago that all changed. I was in a Fry's store (a supermarket ) It was Vetern's week so Had on a Viet Nam vet hat and shirt. I was standing looking at something and felt a light tapping on my back. I turn to find what looked to be a brother and sister maybe 7 to 8 years old, they looked up at me ( i could see just alittle fear in their eyes ). The little girl said to me ""Welcome Home and the Little boy put out his hand for me to shake and said to me "" Thank you for Serving "". I know it was the parents that told the kids what to do and say. I thanked them both with a salute and a thank you and spent the rest of my time in the store with tears in my eyes. That meant more to me then all the metals, everything.

864315,AYXEEMHPF98Z5,B00069L0YK,S. G Spires,"[5, 8]","This was a ""groundbreaking"" TV show for its time -- not unlike Miami Vice -- and the music does make the episodes more interesting. To me the lack of the original music soundtrack from the first run does slightly detract from the series.I don't think it takes away from the good plotlines or performances though.I'll probably buy Season 2 used, because of all three seasons this was my least favorite. It's not so much of the love triangle soap opera stuff but just that it wasn't written all that well  like the first season.That said, the reason this season is shorter, people might remember, is due to the fact there was a writers guild strike that ran from mid to late 1988. That meant no new scripts were ordered for tv or movies. It was so bad, the ABC network put Mission Impossible back in the line up as a new show but used old scripts from the 1960s and 1970s to dodge around the strike.Tour of Duty was great the first year, so-so the second, but the third season was when it really hit its stride. The platoon becomes part of a special ops group, known as SOG. There were some great episodes that year.So, I'm holding out for season three.",4,Great TV ... but its still TV,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,1151,"['was', 'groundbreaking', 'TV', 'show', 'time', 'not', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'music', 'make', 'episodes', 'more', 'interesting', 'lack', 'original', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'first', 'run', 'slightly', 'detract', 'series.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'away', 'good', 'plotlines', 'performances', 'though.I', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'buy', 'Season', '2', 'used', 'three', 'seasons', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'triangle', 'soap', 'opera', 'stuff', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'written', 'well', 'first', 'season.That', 'said', 'reason', 'season', 'shorter', 'people', 'might', 'remember', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'writers', 'guild', 'strike', 'ran', 'mid', 'late', '1988', 'meant', 'new', 'scripts', 'were', 'ordered', 'tv', 'movies', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'ABC', 'network', 'put', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'back', 'line', 'up', 'new', 'show', 'used', 'old', 'scripts', '1960s', '1970s', 'dodge', 'strike.Tour', 'Duty', 'was', 'great', 'first', 'year', 'so-so', 'second', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'when', 'really', 'hit', 'stride', 'platoon', 'part', 'special', 'ops', 'group', 'known', 'SOG', 'were', 'great', 'episodes', 'year.So', ""'m"", 'holding', 'out', 'season', 'three']",N/A

While I agree it was grainy in some scenes, and I watched it on a smaller screen, it still was a good season with some very dramatic scripts.

Fortunately we're not watching it during the original run otherwise we'd be waiting a long time to find out what happened.It's worth getting the entire series even if the original music isn't included.

It is both entertaining and historically enlightening and relevant.  I may be a bit biased since some of the guys I served with tagged my with the nickname ""Zeke"" because they said that the platoon sargeant in this show reminded them of me and his name on the show is ""Zeke"".  I wear that nickname with pride and honor and I highly recommend this show to anybody with an interest in this subject.  It is extremely well made and the cast is outstanding.  It does not focus so much on the violence or trying to be visually realistic, but rather....it focuses on the bond that developes on a team between men who have so little in common.  However, these men will become closer than blood and they each find out that, although each came for reasons of patriotism or being drafted or just having a job, they will fight more for each other than for any cause or monetary stipend.  It's all about the team...the brotherhood.  A valuable lesson.
