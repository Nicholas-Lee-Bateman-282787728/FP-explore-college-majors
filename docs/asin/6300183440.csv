203019,A1EHD9FFW3274W,6300183440,copy_1@hotmail.com,"[11, 11]","8. ICEMAN (drama, 1984) A team of Arctic-research scientists uncover the body of a 40 000 year old Neanderthal Man frozen in a slab of ice. Miraculously, he is brought to life by Dr. Diane Brady (Lindsay Crouse),  and her surgical doctors. The Iceman (John Lone) is placed in an artificial  wilderness housing, enclosed from the rest of the world. Anthropologist Dr.  Stanley Shepard (Timothy Hutton) is brought in to study the man. However,  he goes one stop further by making face to face contact. With the help of  Diane, their struggle to identify with the Iceman becomes a personal, and  moving experience.Critique: A visual as well as a 'sound' delight,  Iceman is a touching film that brings the naturally in all of us. That film  lore feeds our emotions and our intellectual curiosity. Australian director  Fred Schepisi provides the lush, snow-covered landscapes with a rich  musical tapestry to reside on. Schepisi makes us feel close to the Iceman  by placing him in the position of stranger (which is where we, as audience,  are on), and surveyor of truth. Although it has the same plot overtones of  a Frankenstein's monster dilemma (should a creation be exploited?), it does  sway from this by giving us an insight into the Iceman's past. Actor John  Lone's debut performance as the Iceman is wholly potent, as a rendition of  our 'shadow side'. While Lindsay Crouse for once plays a sensitive  scientist. The best moment of the film comes when the Iceman, at last  happy, plummets through the Arctic air and comes full circle in his quest.  With the film's beautiful soundtrack guiding him.QUOTES: Iceman:  &quot;Pita!!&quot;",4,CULT MOVIES 8,917913600,"02 2, 1999",1999,1640,"['8', 'ICEMAN', 'drama', '1984', 'team', 'Arctic-research', 'scientists', 'body', '40', '000', 'year', 'old', 'Neanderthal', 'Man', 'slab', 'ice', 'Miraculously', 'brought', 'life', 'Dr.', 'Diane', 'Brady', 'Lindsay', 'Crouse', 'surgical', 'doctors', 'Iceman', 'John', 'Lone', 'placed', 'artificial', 'wilderness', 'housing', 'enclosed', 'rest', 'world', 'Anthropologist', 'Dr.', 'Stanley', 'Shepard', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'brought', 'study', 'man', 'However', 'one', 'stop', 'further', 'making', 'face', 'face', 'contact', 'help', 'Diane', 'struggle', 'identify', 'Iceman', 'personal', 'moving', 'experience.Critique', 'visual', 'as', 'well', ""'sound"", 'delight', 'Iceman', 'touching', 'film', 'naturally', 'film', 'lore', 'feeds', 'emotions', 'intellectual', 'curiosity', 'Australian', 'director', 'Fred', 'Schepisi', 'lush', 'snow-covered', 'landscapes', 'rich', 'musical', 'tapestry', 'reside', 'Schepisi', 'feel', 'close', 'Iceman', 'placing', 'position', 'stranger', 'where', 'audience', 'are', 'surveyor', 'truth', 'same', 'plot', 'overtones', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'dilemma', 'should', 'creation', 'be', 'exploited', 'sway', 'giving', 'insight', 'Iceman', 'past', 'Actor', 'John', 'Lone', 'debut', 'performance', 'Iceman', 'wholly', 'potent', 'rendition', ""'shadow"", 'side', 'Lindsay', 'Crouse', 'once', 'sensitive', 'scientist', 'best', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'Iceman', 'last', 'happy', 'plummets', 'Arctic', 'air', 'full', 'circle', 'quest', 'film', 'beautiful', 'soundtrack', 'guiding', 'him.QUOTES', 'Iceman', 'quot', 'Pita', 'quot']",N/A

But at that time, I did not understand the deeper message the director was trying to convey to the viewers. When I watched it again, the message hit me like a ton of bricks!This movie shows us the attitude of human behaviour when Man receives additional knowledge about his past origins. The way the prehistoric man was treated by the ""cold-hearted"" scientists shows us that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing for immature people. It is like giving matches to a child and expecting the kid to be safe with it. Humanity has progressed in the scientific field but when it comes to moral behaviour, we are primitive in this aspect. (A good example is the countless of wars being fought with the use of destructive weapons over the last century alone)In short, the reason why I gave this movie a 4 star rating is because there are virtually no extra features of this DVD.
