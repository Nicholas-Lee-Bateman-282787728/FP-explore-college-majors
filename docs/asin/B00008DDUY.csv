When I found out that this movie was based on a true story I knew I should give it a watch. After watching this movie I never realized how hard it is to survive on the streets as a drug dealer and there are very few people you can trust. It is a movie that is very explicit with content but if your there to get a message it is delivered and it makes you realize that this type of stuff goes on everyday in our life. It was up there for some of my favorite movies gangster wise like get rich or die trying, never die alone, and boyz n da hood. The movie turns around 1 hour and 40 minutes and has a nice pace all the way through. For a movie with a low budget money wise it sure delivered a message and as a movie as a whole.

738924,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00008DDUY,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[1, 1]","When I first check the summary on the back cover of this DVD casing, I'd figured, &quot;Aw, man.  Not another movie about drug dealers at the projects&quot;, but after watching PAID IN FULL, there was more to this movie than from my previous expectation.  This movie was based on a true story, and it was depicit on that true nature pretty well.  It was about a typical brotha' narratin' his life as a low-down homeboy named Ace working at a low-down dry-cleaner shop in the mid-80s, and later he decides to walk down the road of &quot;drug-dealership&quot;; coincidentely, he follows the road the way Al Pacino does in SCARFACE.  He starts his &quot;business&quot; cheap for the &quot;consumers&quot;, hire peeps to control marketing order in the streets, so &quot;everybody can eat&quot; and Ace can bring love and respect for the people on the streets and his family and friends, while at the same, keeping his business discreet from 'the man'.  Sadly, as good as how he keep everything organized for the good of his fellowship, he hasn't a clue to the hardship and sacrifices he's going to face as he walks down this easy road.As recyclable and semi-predictable this movie can be, PAID IN FULL is deep, and it does wonders on showing the experience on a drug dealer's life.  For a company that makes Jay-Z LPs, Roc-a-fella did a good job making this movie, and for brining a good selection of cast, not to mentions collaboratin' few of the rappers like Cam-ron and Doug E. Fresh.  Wood Harris did good with his narration and portrayin' Ace, but I got to give it up to Mekhi Phifer.  He show a lot of passion with his role showing how much he supports his friends and his younger brother hoping his bro' would be a better person in the future, and for that, I'd say his acting was very good.  It's not wonderful, but he did a pretty strong performance.  The music score is good as well, but strangely, in one certain scene, the movie's playing a Phil Collins's song in the background.  Why did they even put that song in a movie like this, I'm not so sure.I would've wanted more from this movie after watching it, but the extras in this DVD are lacking, since it only has a commentary and trailers for other films.  To 'da point, PAID IN FULL isn't gonna put a gunshot through my chest and into my heart(in a positive remark), it isn't provoking enough to see this different than any other films of the same theme, but with its above-par actors and true-to-life nature of 80s uptown, this movie has paid in full and served me well to enjoy it.",4,"Drugs, gangs, family: this movie definitely paid in full.",1074902400,"01 24, 2004",2004,2546,"['When', 'first', 'check', 'summary', 'back', 'cover', 'DVD', 'casing', ""'d"", 'figured', 'quot', 'Aw', 'man', 'Not', 'movie', 'drug', 'dealers', 'projects', 'quot', 'watching', 'PAID', 'IN', 'FULL', 'was', 'more', 'movie', 'previous', 'expectation', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'depicit', 'true', 'nature', 'pretty', 'well', 'was', 'typical', 'brotha', 'narratin', 'life', 'low-down', 'homeboy', 'named', 'Ace', 'working', 'low-down', 'dry-cleaner', 'shop', 'mid-80s', 'later', 'walk', 'road', 'quot', 'drug-dealership', 'quot', 'coincidentely', 'road', 'way', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'SCARFACE', 'quot', 'business', 'quot', 'cheap', 'quot', 'consumers', 'quot', 'hire', 'peeps', 'control', 'marketing', 'order', 'streets', 'so', 'quot', 'everybody', 'can', 'eat', 'quot', 'Ace', 'can', 'bring', 'love', 'respect', 'people', 'streets', 'family', 'friends', 'same', 'keeping', 'business', 'discreet', ""'the"", 'man', 'Sadly', 'as', 'good', 'how', 'keep', 'everything', 'organized', 'good', 'fellowship', ""n't"", 'clue', 'hardship', 'going', 'face', 'down', 'easy', 'road.As', 'recyclable', 'semi-predictable', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'PAID', 'IN', 'FULL', 'deep', 'wonders', 'showing', 'experience', 'drug', 'dealer', 'life', 'company', 'Jay-Z', 'LPs', 'Roc-a-fella', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'movie', 'brining', 'good', 'selection', 'cast', 'not', 'mentions', 'collaboratin', 'few', 'rappers', 'Cam-ron', 'Doug', 'E.', 'Fresh', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'did', 'good', 'narration', 'portrayin', 'Ace', 'got', 'give', 'up', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'lot', 'passion', 'role', 'showing', 'how', 'much', 'friends', 'younger', 'brother', 'hoping', 'bro', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'person', 'future', ""'d"", 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'wonderful', 'did', 'pretty', 'strong', 'performance', 'music', 'score', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'strangely', 'one', 'certain', 'scene', 'movie', 'playing', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'song', 'background', 'Why', 'did', 'even', 'put', 'song', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure.I', 'would', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'more', 'movie', 'watching', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'lacking', 'only', 'commentary', 'trailers', 'other', 'films', ""'da"", 'point', 'PAID', 'IN', 'FULL', ""n't"", 'gon', 'put', 'gunshot', 'chest', 'heart', 'positive', 'remark', ""n't"", 'provoking', 'enough', 'see', 'different', 'other', 'films', 'same', 'theme', 'above-par', 'actors', 'true-to-life', 'nature', '80s', 'uptown', 'movie', 'paid', 'full', 'served', 'well', 'enjoy']",Paid in Full

What is working for this film is a combination of many vital elements that combine to make quite a tasty slice of urban life. The film has plot,character development and outstanding acting. The stand out preformance in the movie is Mekhi Phifer playing one of the three Harlem drug dealers with such freshness. Cam'ron's role as Rico is quite good considering he is a rapper and not a trained actor.  Then again, I guess the role Cam'ron played is not a strech consdering the type of lyrics presents in his music.The plot of the movie is based around the life of three famous drug dealers in Harlem named Az,Alpo,and Richard Porter. In the movie their names are fictionalized into Ace[Az],Mitch[Richard Porter],and Rico[Alpo]. I will not bore with anyfurther details because I am sure the following has probably been overemphasized enough in other reviews. Understand,though, the movie was told primarly  through the eyes of Az and not through Alpo.

738929,A34FSS6DNL1UJ,B00008DDUY,"""iriley1979""","[6, 6]","This movie is actually really good. The acting is amazing. The direction is good, the script is well done, the dialouge is also very convincing. Although I was young in the mid 80's (I was about seven or eight) I rember from the music videos and from how older kids dressed that this movie captured that era perfectly. This movie is extreemly authentic. Being a drug dealer was a lot easier in the 80s than it is now. Less competation, less attention from the cops, etc. Also Cocaine was not nearly as plentiful and was thus much more expensive....The star of this film plays Avon Barksdale on the HBO series ""The Wire"". In this movie he is a lot nicer than he is on the wire, more of a buisness man and less of a gangster. Michael Phifer, who plays Mitch, is practaclly a staple now of any movie invovling the hood but he is defintly a good actor. Nither ""Avon"" or Phifer give their best perfomances in this movie but they are both solid. However, Camron is amazing. I know, I know, he had the juiceist, easiest part, the least complex character, etc. However, no one can say he did not impress in this movie, he blew me away! Wow! And I did not even know that was Camron until the ending credits, the whole movie I was thinking, who is this guy, how come I have never heard of him before, etc. Only when I read the credits did I know who he was, I did not Camron was so big and diseal. He has unbelivable screen presence, the viewer canot take their eyes off of him. He outacts everyone is this movie. Even though he had a less challanging role than everyone else in the film that does not change the fact that his performance was incrediable. Not since Tupac Shakur died have I seen an a rapper act that well. (Dont get me wrong, he does not compare to Tupac, but he is the closest thing we currently have in terms of acting ability)I really cant say enough good things about his perfomance, so convcing as the loudmouth, obnouxious, but incredibly dangerous gangster. His only weakness his overconfidence and love of the spot light. What a character contrast to ""Avon"" the the guy who played Ace in this movie. Ace was smarter than Rico though and thats why he managed to avoid jail while Rico got played. I liked the ending too, the kidnapping out of nowhere was great, showing that just because these guys are drug dealers does not mean they are the only low lives in the hood. All three main characters paid the price for all the easy money they made, no one gets off unscatheed although justice certainly does not prevail. Ace goes on the be a legitimate entrapuner, although he got his foot in the door with blood soaked drug money, but hey, thats life. If Ace had stayed at the laundry he would have been poor for ever, he did what he had to do to benefit himself, however, he caused untold misery doing it. Life is no fairytale and taking the moral highground will result in poverty and hopelessnes. However, choosing the dark path of narcotics sales results in a parinoid existence of betrayal, murder, and incarceration. Their are no easy choices or clear moral distinctions in this movie, this movie is the truth!",4,Drug dealers get paid in cash but pay it back in blood!,1060128000,"08 6, 2003",2003,3127,"['movie', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'amazing', 'direction', 'good', 'script', 'well', 'done', 'dialouge', 'also', 'very', 'convincing', 'was', 'young', 'mid', '80', 'was', 'about', 'seven', 'eight', 'rember', 'music', 'videos', 'how', 'older', 'kids', 'dressed', 'movie', 'captured', 'era', 'perfectly', 'movie', 'extreemly', 'authentic', 'Being', 'drug', 'dealer', 'was', 'lot', 'easier', '80s', 'now', 'Less', 'competation', 'less', 'attention', 'cops', 'etc', 'Also', 'Cocaine', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'plentiful', 'was', 'thus', 'much', 'more', 'expensive', '.The', 'star', 'film', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'HBO', 'series', 'Wire', 'movie', 'lot', 'nicer', 'wire', 'more', 'buisness', 'man', 'less', 'gangster', 'Michael', 'Phifer', 'who', 'Mitch', 'practaclly', 'staple', 'now', 'movie', 'invovling', 'hood', 'defintly', 'good', 'actor', 'Avon', 'Phifer', 'give', 'best', 'perfomances', 'movie', 'are', 'solid', 'However', 'Camron', 'amazing', 'know', 'know', 'had', 'juiceist', 'easiest', 'part', 'least', 'complex', 'character', 'etc', 'However', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'impress', 'movie', 'blew', 'away', 'Wow', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'was', 'Camron', 'ending', 'credits', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'thinking', 'who', 'guy', 'how', 'come', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'etc', 'Only', 'when', 'read', 'credits', 'did', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'Camron', 'was', 'so', 'big', 'diseal', 'unbelivable', 'screen', 'presence', 'viewer', 'canot', 'take', 'eyes', 'everyone', 'movie', 'Even', 'had', 'less', 'challanging', 'role', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'not', 'change', 'fact', 'performance', 'was', 'incrediable', 'Not', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'died', 'have', 'seen', 'rapper', 'act', 'well', 'Dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'compare', 'Tupac', 'closest', 'thing', 'currently', 'have', 'terms', 'acting', 'ability', 'really', 'cant', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'perfomance', 'so', 'convcing', 'loudmouth', 'obnouxious', 'incredibly', 'dangerous', 'gangster', 'only', 'weakness', 'overconfidence', 'love', 'spot', 'light', 'What', 'character', 'contrast', 'Avon', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Ace', 'movie', 'Ace', 'was', 'smarter', 'Rico', 'thats', 'why', 'managed', 'avoid', 'jail', 'Rico', 'got', 'played', 'liked', 'ending', 'too', 'kidnapping', 'nowhere', 'was', 'great', 'showing', 'just', 'guys', 'are', 'drug', 'dealers', 'not', 'mean', 'are', 'only', 'low', 'lives', 'hood', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'paid', 'price', 'easy', 'money', 'made', 'one', 'off', 'unscatheed', 'justice', 'certainly', 'not', 'prevail', 'Ace', 'be', 'legitimate', 'entrapuner', 'got', 'foot', 'door', 'blood', 'soaked', 'drug', 'money', 'hey', 'thats', 'life', 'Ace', 'had', 'stayed', 'laundry', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'poor', 'ever', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'benefit', 'however', 'caused', 'untold', 'misery', 'doing', 'Life', 'fairytale', 'taking', 'moral', 'highground', 'will', 'result', 'poverty', 'hopelessnes', 'However', 'choosing', 'dark', 'path', 'narcotics', 'sales', 'results', 'parinoid', 'existence', 'betrayal', 'murder', 'incarceration', 'are', 'easy', 'choices', 'clear', 'moral', 'distinctions', 'movie', 'movie', 'truth']",Paid in Full

738937,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00008DDUY,mirasreviews,"[6, 6]","Ace (Wood Harris) is a young man working in a dry cleaners in 1985 Harlem. His friend Mitch (Mekhi Phifer) sells cocaine, drives flashy cars, and has cash to burn. When Mitch goes to prison and a couple of coincidences leave Ace with a ball of cocaine in his pocket and customers waiting to buy, Ace decides to enter the drug-dealing business that he had previously shunned. He quickly rises to prominence as the cocaine kingpin of Harlem. When Mitch is released from prison, Ace brings him into the business as a partner, along with Mitch's volatile acquaintance from prison, Rico (Cam'ron). When violence erupts, Ace begins to question whether the money that his cocaine business has provided him is worth its cost.At first look, Paid In Full seems to retread a lot of territory that has already been covered in a slew of films about inner-city drug-dealing since the 1980's. There are a couple of things that set this film apart, however, and make it worth seeing. This film emphasizes the characters' development and inner struggles more, and the trappings of the gangsta lifestyle less, than most films on the same topic. And Paid In Full is based on a true story: the story of AZ, Rich Porter, and Alpo, three young men who controlled the cocaine trade in Harlem in the mid-1980's. (Called Ace, Mitch, and Rico, respectively, in the film.) Azie Faison, who was AZ back then, cooperated with the film and wrote an early version of the screenplay. He has since criticized the film for glamorizing the gangsta lifestyle too much and not being a strong enough cautionary tale. I don't find that Paid In Full glamorizes the lifestyle all that much, but its criticism of gangsta life is not heavy-handed either. Perhaps it is better that the film did not moralize as much as it could have because that tends to alienate the audience. You will have to see it and judge for yourself.The film's faults are more annoying than serious. I found it slow in parts. And there is a lot of carelessness with accuracy. The film states at the outset that it takes place in 1985-1986. But the Saab sports cars that the drug dealers are so fond of driving are not 1980's models. And someone talks on a cell phone in one scene -a little, modern cell phone, not a huge 1980's model. First-time feature film director Charles Stone should try hard to avoid this sort of sloppiness in the future, as it can ruin a perfectly good movie.I recommend Paid In Full for its realistic depiction of a particular lifestyle -and its consequences- in a particular time and place in American History. It is especially interesting because the events are seen through the eyes of someone who actually lived them.",4,"Personal, True Account of the Gangsta Life",1050192000,"04 13, 2003",2003,2678,"['Ace', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'young', 'man', 'working', 'dry', 'cleaners', '1985', 'Harlem', 'friend', 'Mitch', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'cocaine', 'flashy', 'cars', 'cash', 'burn', 'When', 'Mitch', 'prison', 'couple', 'coincidences', 'leave', 'Ace', 'ball', 'cocaine', 'pocket', 'customers', 'waiting', 'buy', 'Ace', 'enter', 'drug-dealing', 'business', 'had', 'previously', 'shunned', 'quickly', 'prominence', 'cocaine', 'kingpin', 'Harlem', 'When', 'Mitch', 'released', 'prison', 'Ace', 'business', 'partner', 'Mitch', 'volatile', 'acquaintance', 'prison', 'Rico', ""Cam'ron"", 'When', 'violence', 'erupts', 'Ace', 'question', 'money', 'cocaine', 'business', 'provided', 'cost.At', 'first', 'look', 'Paid', 'Full', 'retread', 'lot', 'territory', 'already', 'been', 'covered', 'slew', 'films', 'inner-city', 'drug-dealing', '1980', 'are', 'couple', 'things', 'set', 'film', 'apart', 'however', 'make', 'worth', 'seeing', 'film', 'characters', 'development', 'inner', 'struggles', 'more', 'trappings', 'gangsta', 'lifestyle', 'less', 'most', 'films', 'same', 'topic', 'Paid', 'Full', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'story', 'AZ', 'Rich', 'Porter', 'Alpo', 'three', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'controlled', 'cocaine', 'trade', 'Harlem', 'mid-1980', 'Called', 'Ace', 'Mitch', 'Rico', 'respectively', 'film', 'Azie', 'Faison', 'who', 'was', 'AZ', 'back', 'then', 'cooperated', 'film', 'wrote', 'early', 'version', 'screenplay', 'criticized', 'film', 'glamorizing', 'gangsta', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'being', 'strong', 'enough', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'Paid', 'Full', 'lifestyle', 'that', 'much', 'criticism', 'gangsta', 'life', 'not', 'heavy-handed', 'either', 'Perhaps', 'better', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'moralize', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'alienate', 'audience', 'will', 'have', 'see', 'judge', 'yourself.The', 'film', 'faults', 'are', 'more', 'annoying', 'serious', 'found', 'slow', 'parts', 'lot', 'carelessness', 'accuracy', 'film', 'states', 'outset', 'place', '1985-1986', 'Saab', 'sports', 'cars', 'drug', 'dealers', 'are', 'so', 'fond', 'driving', 'are', 'not', '1980', 'models', 'someone', 'talks', 'cell', 'phone', 'one', 'scene', '-a', 'little', 'modern', 'cell', 'phone', 'not', 'huge', '1980', 'model', 'First-time', 'feature', 'film', 'director', 'Charles', 'Stone', 'should', 'try', 'hard', 'avoid', 'sort', 'sloppiness', 'future', 'can', 'ruin', 'perfectly', 'good', 'movie.I', 'recommend', 'Paid', 'Full', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'particular', 'lifestyle', '-and', 'consequences-', 'particular', 'time', 'place', 'American', 'History', 'especially', 'interesting', 'events', 'are', 'seen', 'eyes', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'lived']",Paid in Full

This movie delievers with actors who can act, and not crap like State Property run by rappers.peace",4,"The American dream, their way",1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,913,"['one', 'thing', 'appriciate', 'movie', 'feel', 'realisim', 'feel', 'old', 'harlem', 'hood', 'movies', 'not', 'State', 'Property', 'Baby', 'Boy', 'horsecrap', 'gangsta', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'Ace', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'best', 'friend', 'Mitch', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'who', 'get', 'good', 'buisness', 'going', 'out', 'Mitch', 'put', 'bars', 'when', 'get', 'nusience', 'block', 'So', 'Ace', 'move', 'everyone', 'happy', 'becoming', 'top', 'dog', 'around.But', 'world', 'Harlem', 'drug', 'dealers', 'always', 'load', 'backstabbing', 'snakes', 'filled', 'envy', 'try', 'get', 'way', 'kidnapping', 'jacking', 'murder', 'movie', 'very', 'balievable', 'way.This', 'movie', 'highly', 'underratted', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'everyone', 'intrest', 'hood', 'gang', 'movies', 'Even', ""Cam'ron"", 'preformance', 'nice', 'too', 'movie', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'not', 'crap', 'State', 'Property', 'run', 'rappers.peace']",Paid in Full

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 0]","March/April: I went to three Hollywood Videos and two Blockbusters because I thought with a Mekhi Phifer movie, I couldn't go wrong. WRONG! This movie was about as boring and dry as most street movies. It was the same ole story. One guy is extra bummy, gets into drugs, gets some money, gets a clique with one loud-mouthed dummy, some people die, THE END. (Note: Mekhi Phifer looked good as usual though, and that's the only reason it got two stars).On second thought, on 6/18/2005, this movie was on BET and I watched it again. For some reason, I really got into it this time. The story didn't change but I failed to notice the relationship between Mekhi's character with his brother, the problems with family members and jealousy, the simplicity and intelligence of the main character wanting to be lowkey, and the very real (and amusing) relationship between the main character and his girl. It bothered me that ol' girl didn't try to talk him out of his lifestyle, but other than that, the movie was pretty decent. I watched it to the end and I liked it this time. No doubt, it's cliche--but an interesting cliche.",3,Change of heart,1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,1118,"['March/April', 'went', 'three', 'Hollywood', 'Videos', 'two', 'Blockbusters', 'thought', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'WRONG', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'boring', 'dry', 'most', 'street', 'movies', 'was', 'same', 'ole', 'story', 'One', 'guy', 'extra', 'bummy', 'drugs', 'money', 'clique', 'one', 'loud-mouthed', 'dummy', 'people', 'die', 'END', 'Note', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'looked', 'good', 'usual', 'only', 'reason', 'got', 'two', 'stars', '.On', 'second', 'thought', '6/18/2005', 'movie', 'was', 'BET', 'watched', 'again', 'reason', 'really', 'got', 'time', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'failed', 'notice', 'relationship', 'Mekhi', 'character', 'brother', 'problems', 'family', 'members', 'jealousy', 'simplicity', 'intelligence', 'main', 'character', 'wanting', 'be', 'lowkey', 'very', 'real', 'amusing', 'relationship', 'main', 'character', 'girl', 'bothered', 'ol', 'girl', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'talk', 'lifestyle', 'other', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'watched', 'end', 'liked', 'time', 'doubt', 'cliche', 'interesting', 'cliche']",Paid in Full
