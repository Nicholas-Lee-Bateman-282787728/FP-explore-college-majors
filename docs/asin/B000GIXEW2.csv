1004772,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000GIXEW2,,"[1, 3]","'Curious George' has captivated children for decades.  This child, during the sixties, was enthralled by the heart-warming and heart-breaking tragedy of every scene gone awry by the lovable and incorrigible monkey, George, and his long-suffering companion, Mr. Joe, bka ""the man with the yellow hat"".Taken to the screen, it is hard to imagine a better treatment for Margaret and H.E. Ray's classic book series.  The story is original, but  contains all the familiar elements we have come to know and love.  The delivery is episodic, yet a complete story is kept intact at the same time.  Mr. Joe (Will Ferrell) is sent by his boss, a museum curator (Dick Van Dyke), to obtain a huge idol on a jungle expedition.  The expedition is botched, but the title character tags along the ship ride home.  Then, we get what can be called the converse of 'King Kong' in cartoon form.  (It is the city rather than the wild acquisition that seems like the monster.  The city adventure as George discovers it in his innocence is beautiful!)The animation is uniquely a fine achievement.  No where have I seen anything like it.  It has none of the advancement of the sanitized computer graphics, but it doesn't come close to reminding one of Disney, either.  The treatment of dark and light with nuances and contrasts and the vibrant colors seems groundbreaking.  It is truly impressive.  Also, the scenes flow with a pace that should satisfy even the shortest attention span.  Jack Johnson's original song soundtrack and the score are playful editions for our viewing occasion.  And, while it should be considered a ""children's movie""--and boy are we short of them nowadays!--the kid factor should include those of us lucky enough to include ourselves:  With the right attributes, some between 3-103!  There is some updating and new twists.  (Can you imagine what a fifties audience would think of Curious George making a mess with ""bathroom tissue"" or some of the innocent innuendos that only adults can get?)  For those over 13, 'Curious George' won't entertain like 'Shrek,' but it won't bore like a 'Barney' extravaganza, either.  (Let's be fair, though, maybe a conceivable 'Barney' movie could be done well.  Hollywood has surprised us before.)  Anyway, this fast-moving adventure stays true to the pictures, the characters, and the spirit of 'Curious George' with fluid animation that doesn't ever disappoint.",4,'Curious George' Forever!

1004774,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B000GIXEW2,Amanda Richards,"[10, 10]","This is a great movie for the whole family.  Simple clean animation and CGI translate the classic story book (taking some liberties) to a format to suit a new generation, with a fantastic soundtrack by Jack Johnson and two popular stars in Will Ferrell and Drew Barrymore.  One would have thought that Ferrell would have been better off as the monkey, but instead he gets to play the second banana as Ted, the Man in the Yellow Hat.  Barrymore plays his love interest, but there ain't much to see in that department.Ted works at a museum which is about to close its doors due to lack of public interest.  The owner's son is all for selling it to build a parking garage, but Ted persuades Mr. Bloomsberry (Dick Van Dyke) to make a last effort by retrieving a huge idol from the Lost Shrine of Zagawa and displaying it at the museum.Before he knows it, Ted is outfitted in a yellow suit and is off playing Indiana Jones with a compromised map.  There he meets the adorable monkey of the tile, who falls in love with Ted's yellow hat and the game of peek-a-boo.  Unfortunately the idol he recovers is slightly smaller than advertised, and he goes home to face the music.Unfortunately, Mr. Bloomsberry has started the advertising campaign for the giant idol, and Ted finds himself at a loss for words and of course an idol.  To compound matters, George has managed to track him across the ocean, and a swinging time follows, as the little monkey can't help but get into trouble.Lots of laughs and of course a happy ending is a given, but it's a fun ride all the same.

He is enthralled with it. This movie tells the story of how George came to live with the Man with the Yellow Hat.

Still, my toddler doesn't seem to care, and enjoys this movie over and over. If you need to entertain a little one for an hour and a half, this is a good way to do it.

1004776,AH93HX89KVQG2,B000GIXEW2,"Amy Green ""Amy Green""","[4, 4]","My young daughter liked the movie 'just OK'... and I feel the same way. If you just want a fluffy cute movie to entertain your kids for a couple of hours, this will do. But it doesn't ""feel"" like Curious George. The only similarities to it and the original books are: the monkey looks and is named the same and gets into continual scrapes, and he is owned by a man who looks the same as the one in the books. Everything else is different.The man with the yellow hat doesn't willingly take George from Africa like in the first book; George follows him secretly. In the books, the man loves George unconditionally; he never wants to get rid of George no matter what scrapes he gets into, and he always helps George get out of them. In this movie, the man keeps trying to get rid of George, which is understandable since he didn't want George in the first place and George is ruining his life. Finally the man succeeds: George is caged and taken away (crying and protesting) and put on a boat bound for Africa. If you're sensitive about what impression media may have on your kids, a running theme in this movie is ""if you're a nuisance people will want to get rid of you."" Abandonment is, of course, one of kids' biggest fears. My daughter of course did not like it when the man gave George away. She wasn't upset with the book's original plot of the man taking George FROM Africa, which some reviewers of the book are upset by or have said their kids are.In the books the man is responsible, level-headed and calm. In this movie the man is a total goofus (just like Disney's Goofy but more self-centered), and has a lot of adult problems that he is trying to solve. The problems George causes are on a larger scale than in the original books. The man gets kicked out of his 'no pets' apartment and has to sleep in Central Park. George causes a massive string of traffic accidents which in real life would probably cause serious injuries. And the man's main problem, which George exacerbates for most of the movie, is that the museum where he works is in danger of being shut down for lack of public interest, and the smarmy son of the museum's owner is trying to spur that on so he can build a parking lot on the land. The salvation of the museum is centered on an ancient African monkey idol (the museum's display of it includes tribal Africans kneeling in worship of the idol, just FYI if you care about such things). Why such an adult plot in a kids' movie?The man belatedly realizes that all the havoc George has caused in his life has actually enriched his life, and he goes through many Goofy-esque acrobatic stunts to rescue George from the boat just as it is leaving. The man gets George back, saves the museum and gets the girl (yes, there is a love interest). This movie really is more about the man than about George.If you love the books like I do, I highly recommendCurious George (Collector's Edition). My daughter and I both liked it a LOT more than this movie. It is actually an animated version of two of the books, and it was overseen by Margret Rey. It also has several other animated shorts of classic books including Frog and Toad. The PBS animated seriesCurious George: Monkey Collection, Vol. 1is a lot better than this movie too.",2,"Not true to the spirit of the books, and very complicated, adult and annoying situations",1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,3252,"['young', 'daughter', 'liked', 'movie', 'OK', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'just', 'want', 'fluffy', 'cute', 'movie', 'entertain', 'kids', 'couple', 'hours', 'will', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Curious', 'George', 'only', 'similarities', 'original', 'books', 'are', 'monkey', 'looks', 'named', 'same', 'continual', 'scrapes', 'owned', 'man', 'who', 'same', 'one', 'books', 'Everything', 'else', 'different.The', 'man', 'yellow', 'hat', ""n't"", 'willingly', 'take', 'George', 'Africa', 'first', 'book', 'George', 'secretly', 'books', 'man', 'George', 'unconditionally', 'never', 'get', 'rid', 'George', 'matter', 'what', 'always', 'George', 'get', 'movie', 'man', 'trying', 'get', 'rid', 'George', 'understandable', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'George', 'first', 'place', 'George', 'ruining', 'life', 'Finally', 'man', 'George', 'caged', 'taken', 'away', 'crying', 'protesting', 'put', 'boat', 'bound', 'Africa', ""'re"", 'sensitive', 'what', 'impression', 'media', 'may', 'have', 'kids', 'running', 'theme', 'movie', ""'re"", 'nuisance', 'people', 'will', 'want', 'get', 'rid', 'Abandonment', 'course', 'one', 'kids', 'biggest', 'fears', 'daughter', 'course', 'did', 'not', 'when', 'man', 'gave', 'George', 'away', 'was', ""n't"", 'upset', 'book', 'original', 'plot', 'man', 'taking', 'George', 'FROM', 'Africa', 'reviewers', 'book', 'are', 'upset', 'have', 'said', 'kids', 'are.In', 'books', 'man', 'responsible', 'level-headed', 'calm', 'movie', 'man', 'total', 'goofus', 'just', 'Disney', 'Goofy', 'more', 'self-centered', 'lot', 'adult', 'problems', 'trying', 'solve', 'problems', 'George', 'causes', 'are', 'larger', 'scale', 'original', 'books', 'man', 'kicked', ""'no"", 'pets', 'apartment', 'sleep', 'Central', 'Park', 'George', 'massive', 'string', 'traffic', 'accidents', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'probably', 'cause', 'serious', 'injuries', 'man', 'main', 'problem', 'George', 'most', 'movie', 'museum', 'where', 'danger', 'being', 'shut', 'down', 'lack', 'public', 'interest', 'smarmy', 'son', 'museum', 'owner', 'trying', 'spur', 'can', 'build', 'parking', 'lot', 'land', 'salvation', 'museum', 'centered', 'ancient', 'African', 'monkey', 'idol', 'museum', 'display', 'tribal', 'Africans', 'kneeling', 'worship', 'idol', 'just', 'FYI', 'care', 'such', 'things', 'Why', 'such', 'adult', 'plot', 'kids', 'movie', 'man', 'belatedly', 'havoc', 'George', 'caused', 'life', 'actually', 'enriched', 'life', 'many', 'Goofy-esque', 'acrobatic', 'stunts', 'rescue', 'George', 'boat', 'just', 'leaving', 'man', 'George', 'back', 'museum', 'girl', 'yes', 'love', 'interest', 'movie', 'really', 'more', 'man', 'George.If', 'love', 'books', 'do', 'highly', 'recommendCurious', 'George', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'daughter', 'liked', 'LOT', 'more', 'movie', 'actually', 'animated', 'version', 'two', 'books', 'was', 'overseen', 'Margret', 'Rey', 'also', 'several', 'other', 'animated', 'shorts', 'classic', 'books', 'including', 'Frog', 'Toad', 'PBS', 'animated', 'seriesCurious', 'George', 'Monkey', 'Collection', 'Vol', '1is', 'lot', 'better', 'movie', 'too']",N/A

I found it to be the best animated movie I saw in 2006. The movie has a lovely 2D, clear line, bright primary colors animation. There are some wonderful songs by Jack Johnson, too. It is aimed at children, not at adults: there are no clever in-jokes here, and it's all very naive. But it is also lovely. The plot stars Ted, a guy who works at a natural history museum that's fallen on hard times and is scheduled to be closed to become a parking lot. In order to prevent this, Ted goes to Africa to find a mysterious idol in order to turn around the museum's luck; he returns instead with a money who will be eventually dubbed Curious George, and who will bring friendly mischief to the city. There are no bad guys here: the closer to a bad guy is the museum's owner's son, but even he is redeemed at the end.

1004778,A29X0YEL6O4KZI,B000GIXEW2,"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[4, 4]","Have you ever dreamed that you could go back to the beginning of your life, and see everything again for the first time? If so, then Curious George is the movie for you. When Ted, a tour leader of a city museum, is sent off to Africa to look for an ancient statue to draw interest back to his museum, he meets a playful monkey in the depths of the African jungle. After Ted amuses the monkey for a few minutes by playing peek-a-boo with the monkey (who is soon named George, after George Washington), George becomes very fond of Ted, The Man in The Yellow Hat. The monkey follows Ted all the way back to the boat destined back to America , stowing away in the cargo bay of the ship. And when George arrives in the big city, you can just imagine that things are turned upside down.In this ode to the children stories written by H.A. Rey, the story of how the monkey and the man met is portrayed in a fun-loving and adorable display of cinema. The first thing I noticed about the film is the animation. It's a breath of fresh air to see the more traditional 2-D drawings of years past. In these times of computer animation and Pixar's CGI epics, Curious George fits in it's own niche as far as animation goes. The soundtrack, which is composed and performed by singer-songwriter Jack Johnson, flows beautifully and seamlessly with with basic nature of the animation. There are no extra bells and whistles in the film, yet the audience does not feel that it is sparse or that they have been cheated. If anything, the nostalgia of the books and the memories of the 2-D animation are sure to draw more people to the theaters.The majority of movies being released since the break of the millennium, have had dark overtones and themes, even within the movies made for children. Curious George is inspiring in the fact that it displays the innocence that all children yearn for. The curiousness of George is not made out to be a nuisance, but an adorable testament to the wonder that children feel on their first trip to a big city.This film may not be as diversely spread for all demographics as Shrek and Finding Nemo are, but this really dosn't matter. The movie makes you feel like a child again and memories of story time and trips to the library are brought back through the fabric of time.Curious George is more then just a monkey. He poses an important question to adults of the world, and that is ""Why are we so scared of children's curiosity?"". We've all seen it...parents yelling at their kids for straying a few feet from their side. Children need their time of exploration and inquisitiveness. George stands as a symbol of the innocence of a child's mind, and that's why his character is loved by kids world wide.

That the two don't match up very well is a testament to changing times I think, and not because the creators of the movie didn't care about preserving the original.  But before I get into that I will review the movie as it stands on its own.The ""man with the yellow hat"" (nicely voiced by Will Farrel) is a museum docent who cares passionately about his work and wants to communicate his love of history and the natural world to a disinterested city.  It seems that the museum is failing financially, and destined to soon become a parking lot unless he and the owner can come up with a grand new attraction to bring in the money.  So the man with the yellow hat buys the latest in adventure clothing and sets out to Africa on a mission to find a gigantic idol for their exhibit.  He finds George instead (a very good little monkey, but extremely curious).  George stows away on the ship headed back to America, and there he creates a lot of mischief and fun.  The man with the yellow hat is at a loss about what to do with his new little friend, but soon learns to appreciate the little monkey and learns from his insatiable curiosity to stop worrying and enjoying life more.We are Curious George fans (my household includes a 4 and 7-year old to whom I have read these books many times before bed).  I thought the movie was sweet and innocent, done in a simpler animation style with soft washes of bright color that stayed fairly true to the feeling of the illustrations from the books.  This entranced my four year old:  the seven year old was bored, as I might have expected.  After all, the books were meant more for the pre-K ages.Speaking of innocence, you might have guessed from my summary that the movie took HUGE liberties with the plot.  In its defense, imagine movie audiences of today reacting to some guy showing up in Africa, dropping a monkey into a sack and hauling him off to America to live in his house largely unsupervised.  Then imagine that the monkey accidentally dials the Fire Department, which shows up and arrests him for false alarm, taking him to a prison infested with rats.  When the books were written what, 50 years ago?  this may have seemed more plausible.  Not today, by a long shot!  So you see how there had to be a major rewrite for this to work as a movie in 2006.I thought this was a fun film to see with your 2-5 year old child, but perhaps too simple for older kids unless they are rabid Curious George fans to begin with.

We both have loved animated movies since we were little and still love them today. We have never read the Curious George books (at least none that I can remember). And yet when we saw that this was premering on Nickelodeon and was starring the voice talent of Will Ferrell (who is also starring in my latest obsession Megamind, which I also recommend), we decided to give it a shot. And we're glad we did.This movie is just great! Will Ferrell is hilarious and just brings so much life to the story. He's a realistic character, not the typical cardboard little kids movie character. The other character who brings life to the story is George. He's a cute little monkey who is just so adorable. He can't talk, but his facial expressions say everything he's thinking. Throughout the movie, these two go on one adventure after another while at the same time trying to make sure the museum Ted (aka Man in the Yellow Hat) works for.This movie has plenty of jokes, and they aren't just slapstick. There are some really laugh-out-lines in here for both kids and adults (and even teens). The animation is great and smooth, but also colorful. I'm really surprised how much I liked this movie. They could've made it a boring, dull, mind numbing movie that will only entertain little kids. What we got was a fun, adventurous, hilarious movie with a lot of heart that will make you go LOL and ""Awww"". I would buy this movie for myself in a heartbeat (as long as it was under 20 dollars), and could easily watch it again by myself or with my brother and cousins.

1004788,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000GIXEW2,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","You only grow old when you lose the capacity for childlike wonder.  That is the message I take away from Curious George, this old friend I hadn't thought about in years.  All children know and love Curious George - hospitals really ought to send a Curious George book home with all newborn babies because you can't possibly be a kid without one.  Any child will love this movie because it's funny and they can identify with the cute little guy at the center of it.  That is why I am going to take a different tack and attempt to review this movie as an adult.We live in a jaded, dangerous, increasingly evil world that breeds hatred and cynicism.  A few dreamers manage to succeed and inspire others, but most are laughed at and derided.  Society tells you to conform to expectations and, whatever you do, don't rock the boat.  Things are the way they are, so just accept it and don't ask questions.  Blech!  There's no wonder so many people are living empty, miserable lives.  Curious George knows better; he knows how even the simplest things around us are sources of infinite wonder and fun.  Sure, he gets into trouble sometimes, but he really lives - and he spreads his wonderful spirit with everyone he comes in contact with.  Do you remember how much fun you had as a kid?  Back then, even a dandelion was an incredible source of wonder and fun.  Now, it's just a weed we curse for spreading its nefarious seeds all over our yards.  This movie takes us back to those halcyon days of innocent youth, and that's more than worth the price of admission.Obviously, this film differs from the classic Curious George books, but it truly does capture the spirit that inspired them.  I loved the animation because it helped tell the story without trying to impress us with super-fantastic 3D or similarly absurd special effects.  Will Ferrell makes for a most fitting (and funny) man in the yellow coat and hat, but this really is George's story - and what a wonderful, richly simple story it is.  Unless you're just hopelessly cynical, you'll be amused by the little guy's adventures and heart-melting cuteness.  Why, oh why, though, do filmmakers insist on adding a terribly sad scene to every child-oriented film?  These sorts of scenes bother me more as an adult than they ever did as a child, but any sensitive soul - of any age - will be affected by such an unnecessary moment of angst.  It doesn't last long, however, as a happy ending is guaranteed.All I really want to say is that this adult loved this movie.  Many adults would say the film is too simplistic and childlike to appeal to them, but I don't see things that way.  Children will be entertained by Curious George, but at least some of us adults will be reminded of what we have lost - our innocence and sense of wonder - and inspired to try and recapture the kind of curious outlook that makes life worth living.

1004795,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000GIXEW2,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[3, 4]","This is a feature film version of the popular ""Curious George"" books by H.A. and Margret Rey. In this film, Ted (The Man in the Yellow Hat --- they decided he needed a name) finds himself facing the prospect of being jobless when the museum he works out is faced with closure. The son of the curator is all ready to have it torn down for a parking lot, but Ted is desparate to save it. He goes on a jungle expedition to find a lost idol and ends up having the wildly cute, curious monkey named George follow him home.""Curious George"" is packed with fun humor, excellent music by Jack Johnson and a strong vocal team. Will Ferrell is the voice of Ted and Drew Barrymore provides the voice of his love interest. Dick Van Dyke is the museum curator and the awesomely talented Frank Welker (who was also the voice of Abu in ""Aladdin"") is on hand as George himself.Product placement? Check. Occasional heavy-handed moral? Check. But overall, neither of these dampened my enthusiasm for the film.The animation is fantastic. I believe it's a combination of CG and traditional animation and overall it has a very rich, but also sweet look.The ""Curious George"" DVD comes with a nice set of bonus features. There are 15 Deleted Scenes --- stuff that was scripted for the movie, but didn't make into the final version. A lot of these deleted scenes are in uncolored animation, others are storyboards. Most of them are extensions of scenes already seen in the film. Of particular interest is one in which the outfitters for Ted's yellow suit go into a full on Crocodile Hunter (Steve Irwin --- may he rest in peace) spoof. My other favorite bonus feature was one that teaches you how draw George --- I actually managed to do a pretty good job of it for my first try. Monkey in Motion shows how motion for Curious George is animated. There's also another (product-placed) featurette about the animated Volkswagen seen in the film and one from Shea Homes about reading to kids. Finally, there's a set of games, some of DVD-ROM. None of these were especially thrilling or noteable, but they pass for DVD games.Overall, an excellent DVD release.

1004799,A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K,B000GIXEW2,"Jared Castle ""Oregon writer""","[1, 1]","He's cute. He's silly. Curious George steps from his famed children's books and, for a blessed 86 minutes, delivers pure family entertainment both charming and funny.The man with the yellow hat now has a name, Ted (Will Ferrell), and a new career as a Bloomsberry Museum tour guide. I had misgivings when I saw Ferrell's name. His other comedies are not G-rated entertainment and I wasn't interested in exposing my sons (ages 8 and 6) to Ferrell'sSaturday Night Liveshtick. There's nothing to fear though.The movie's G-rating could stand for ""gentle,"" a pleasant change of pace from other kids fare such as the G-rated (for ""gross"")Space Chimpsand the PG-ratedPlanet 51andOpen Season. Curious George's charm is that he generates laughs without trafficking in the rude humor - defecating, passing gas, profanity - now so common in animated children's movies.Joining Ferrell are Drew Barrymore, Dick Van Dyke, Eugene Levy, David Cross and Frank Welker as George. The voice work is good but, most importantly, the stars don't distract from the animation like the odd pairing of John Travolta and Miley Cyrus did inBolt.In summary, Universal Pictures deserves much credit for maintaining the character's innocence after what I've read was a long, drawn-out process to bring Curious George to film. While the film doesn't quite reach classic status, it makes for a wonderful family movie night and will entertain children ages 8 and younger. Rating: Four stars.UPDATE: We held a kids movie night, pairing Curious George with cheese pizza, 40 bananas (in lieu of popcorn) andNeon Monkey Tattoos. The theme party was successful.

His curiousity got him into all sorts of trouble and I got a vicarious thrill out of watching him get out of trouble and have everything turn out all right, but not without a lot of action and suspense and humor first.What kid can't relate to the constant struggle between following the rules and testing the boundaries.?Luckily, this movie stays true to the spirit of the classic books and it features a stellar cast, including Drew Barrymare and Will Ferrell. They do fine in their roles.DO keep in mind that this movie is NOT designed to entertain adults (as Shrek did) There aren't the clever ""in"" jokes and the animation is a bit strange at times. Also, there are updates such as cell phones (not around when Curious George was created).But the spirit of the series remains intact.

She turned to me during the middle of the movie and said, ""Mommy, can we come and see this again?"" And though the audience was filled with a multitude of very young children-- they were quiet and still--they were entranced.This was such a refreshingly sweet natured story--with very decent staring characters.  The Man in the Yellow Hat (Will Ferell) was an amusing nerd but he was also a wonderful model of a man with lots of integrity--a very positive father figure that is so lacking in many children's films.In a time when many children's movies are so cynical and have characters who constantly say rude and insulting things to each other to provide cheap but painful laughs--this was a breath of fresh air in it's non-reliance on hurtful comments from the main characters.  This is how I want my daughter to be treated and act towards others.Another thing I liked about this movie was that it was an old-fashioned cartoon--and not another Pixar type movie.  I do like the Pixar animations and they showed many previews of upcoming movies of that type but this moving needed the simplicity of old-style animation and it worked so well.  It was very visually pleasing to the eye--all the colors just seemed to glow.George himself was more appealing to me in the film than in the books.  For one thing he looked and acted more like a human toddler--and as all of us parents know those little guys are so very curious (at times naughty) but are also so completely enchanting and endearing.  I fell in love with little George from the very start.I believe this movie was produced by Ron Howard.  It's far better than his version of the Grinch who stole Christmas a few years back.  Mr. Howard is a very talented man and I believe he has created a classic movie here with little George.

It was nice to see a cartoon movie without the frills that Pixar create for a change - kind of like going back to my childhood.  It's not too long - so you won't get bored, and the story and humour are as good for kids as adults so everyone can see this.Ted stumbles across George in Africa and George is so taken by him, that he follows him back to New York.  He is very curious as this new world is strange to him.  I love the scene in particular where he is discovering paint in the neighbors apartment while she is taking a bath.  I also love watching him discover bubbles.  He puts his face into one and delights while it pops.This is such a cute movie that everyone will love.

I think that's what makes Curious George such an endearing story/movie. You're likely to see similarities to yourself in it. This movie has a great cast and the music from Jack Johnson is kid friendly and velvety pleasant. In this story, no towering dinosaur exhibit is immune to George and city traffic gets a big dose of the little monkey too. I think my favorite scene in this film is when George gets creative with the various cans of paint left behind in a room. In typical George fashion, painting walls and furniture is only the beginning of the mischief. He's not done until he's poured the rest of it into the sophisticated lady's bath, just to see what the colors will do. (Not long after my son watched the movie he told me I painted like George!

1004810,A2NHPCKUWZUFLM,B000GIXEW2,M. S. Hillis,"[7, 9]","""Curious George"" is actually better than we expected, but in an unexpected way. Let me explain. The storyline of ""Curious George"" is mediocre, leaning towards bad, but the movie's visual style and charm handily overcomes its many little deficiencies.The Man In the Yellow Hat, whose name we learn is Ted, works for a museum that is about to close. To prevent the museum from becoming a parking lot, he heads to Africa to search for a fabled idol. There, he runs into George. Hilarity ensues as the monkey follows Ted back to the city and causes all kinds of trouble.The movie is faithful to the spirit, but not the detail, of the books. The closest the plot comes to anything in the books is a scene when George is carried away by a bundle of helium balloons.If that was all there was to the movie, you could safely skip it. But the movie is worth seeing simply because of the lush and colorful production. The characters thankfully bear only the merest of hints of the overdone Disney-style of animation, and they are softened and brought to life by a marvelous visual style that employs soft edges and bright, but not overbearing, primary colors. The use of light is masterful at times -- for example, bringing a soft glow to George's eyes or Ted's yellow hat while muting the surroundings.The artists also did a marvelous job with George. He is lovingly drawn, and he easily stirs sympathy and affection in the audience. The portrayal of Ted also makes it seem as if he was brought to life straight out of H.A. Reys' books. They didn't hit the same notes of perfection for the other characters, however. For the museum director, it seems like the simply recast Jane's father from Disney's ""Tarzan"". And the mad inventor character sort of appears out of nowhere and is responsible for the movie's disjointed ending.If you have kids, this movie, diamond in the rough though it is, should be a no-brainer.Oh yeah, and the soundtrack by Jack Johnson is a surprisngly sweet touch.",3,Curious About George?,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,1978,"['Curious', 'George', 'actually', 'better', 'expected', 'unexpected', 'way', 'Let', 'explain', 'storyline', 'Curious', 'George', 'mediocre', 'leaning', 'towards', 'bad', 'movie', 'visual', 'style', 'charm', 'handily', 'many', 'little', 'deficiencies.The', 'Man', 'Yellow', 'Hat', 'name', 'learn', 'Ted', 'museum', 'close', 'prevent', 'museum', 'becoming', 'parking', 'lot', 'Africa', 'search', 'fabled', 'idol', 'George', 'Hilarity', 'monkey', 'Ted', 'back', 'city', 'kinds', 'trouble.The', 'movie', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'not', 'detail', 'books', 'closest', 'plot', 'anything', 'books', 'scene', 'when', 'George', 'carried', 'away', 'bundle', 'helium', 'balloons.If', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'movie', 'could', 'safely', 'skip', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'simply', 'lush', 'colorful', 'production', 'characters', 'thankfully', 'bear', 'only', 'merest', 'hints', 'overdone', 'Disney-style', 'animation', 'are', 'softened', 'brought', 'life', 'marvelous', 'visual', 'style', 'soft', 'edges', 'bright', 'not', 'overbearing', 'primary', 'colors', 'use', 'light', 'masterful', 'times', 'example', 'bringing', 'soft', 'glow', 'George', 'eyes', 'Ted', 'yellow', 'hat', 'muting', 'surroundings.The', 'artists', 'also', 'did', 'marvelous', 'job', 'George', 'lovingly', 'drawn', 'easily', 'sympathy', 'affection', 'audience', 'portrayal', 'Ted', 'also', 'seem', 'was', 'brought', 'life', 'straight', 'H.A', 'Reys', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'same', 'notes', 'perfection', 'other', 'characters', 'however', 'museum', 'director', 'simply', 'recast', 'Jane', 'father', 'Disney', 'Tarzan', 'mad', 'inventor', 'character', 'sort', 'nowhere', 'responsible', 'movie', 'disjointed', 'ending.If', 'have', 'kids', 'movie', 'diamond', 'rough', 'should', 'be', 'no-brainer.Oh', 'yeah', 'soundtrack', 'Jack', 'Johnson', 'surprisngly', 'sweet', 'touch']",N/A

When George stows away on the man's boat back to New York, presumably so he can continue their peek-a-boo game, all kinds of mischief ensues. Ted must recover from a failed trek to Africa that was meant to save the museum he works at from going under to the owner's (played by Dick Van Dyke) greedy son junior (David Cross), who wants to raze the place and erect a parking garage instead. George gets Ted into many a scrape, but eventually finds a way to save the day.The DVD has many nice features: 15 deleted scenes, and over 10 interactive games, including How to Draw George (my son loves this one), as well has the ""Find George"" game.

The weakness of the script cannot be denied, but watching the mischievous monkey (or chimpanzee precisely) is pleasant and amusing experience.The story is basically about the buddy-buddy relations between a bumbling curator named Ted (Will Ferrell), and the much-beloved curious monkey. Though the film's beginning chapters about Ted's adventure in the jangle to search for the lost artifact is very unconvincing, the story really gets underway when we see the monkey following him to the big city where some of the famous episodes (about the balloons for instance) are re-created in a modified form.But the real asset of the film is its colorful images drawn in traditional 2-D style. The delightful combination of shades and primary colors is always effective with the rich facial expressions of the monkey, which is really fun to see. The laid-back soundtrack from Jack Johnson is additional merit of the film.Drew Barrymore appears, providing the voice of Maggie, love interest for Ted, but her role is not explored to the full. You can also hear the voices from Dick Van Dyke, Eugene Levy, David Cross and Joan Plowright, but it is veteran Frank `Voice God' Welker who brings the character of George into life.I heard several complaints about this `Curious George' - one British reviewer said it is `perfunctory' and one eminent critic from America said it is enjoyed only by children. I am a 40-year-old adult who consider myself as a huge fan of animations, and I was thoroughly amused, finding that the film is much better than what those remarks suggest.

1004822,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000GIXEW2,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[5, 5]","When I was a young child, I never read the Curious George books.  I heard about him from some of my friends, but that was it.  In fact, I don't think it was until I saw the movie FORREST GUMP that I checked out a copy of the original CURIOUS GEORGE book and was introduced to the adventures of the curious little monkey.  I was in high school at the time, but I'm not ashamed to admit that I found George's exploits entertaining.  Sometimes the messages were overdone and often I found myself comparing how George got in and out of trouble to another character in a different series of children's book our librarian used to read to us, Amelia Bedelia.  Anyway, when I first read about George and the Man in the Yellow Hat, I thought that the stories would make a great animated movie or series.I learned later that the stories had indeed many made into a series of sorts.  However, there was no feature-length film.  That was until now.CURIOUS GEORGE the movie loosely follows the earliest tales of Curious George, but also includes a plot line for adults that ties the whole movie together.  Ted (Will Ferrell) is a young man who works at the City Museum.  The Museum is in financial trouble.  People just aren't visiting it as much as they used to.  The store isn't selling as many items and the restaurant isn't selling much food. In fact, about the only people Ted gets to talk to are a group of preschoolers that Miss Maggie Dunlop (Drew Barrymore) keeps bringing to the museum each week so that she can see and talk to Ted. The owner of the museum, Mr. Bloomsberry [...] is afraid that they will have to sell. Mr. Bloomsberry's son, Junior (David Cross) is hoping they will have to sell so that he can turn the museum into a parking lot and make lots and lots of money.  However, Ted gets the great idea of finding a lost idol and bringing it back to bring in business. Mr. Bloomsberry loves the idea and sends Ted out on a journey to find this lost idol that is supposed to be over three stories tall.  Along the way Ted buys a yellow suit (he gets suckered into buying it), meets George in the jungle, thinks he finds the idol but doesn't, and accidentally brings George back to the U.S.Of course, when George gets here he's curious about everything.  He paints a rich woman's penthouse apartment in colorful pictures, he gets blown away by some balloons at the zoo, and he causes a dinosaur skeleton at the Museum to collapse.  George and Ted bond and through his friendship with the curious little monkey, Ted gets a new lease on life and love.I'm not going to try to kid anyone. CURIOUS GEORGE is a movie that was made mainly for kids.  The movie's bright pallet of colors is quite impressive and when combined with a style of animation patterned after the Curious George books, it's really nice to look at.  That's part of the appeal for very young children. The bright colors are sure to catch and keep their attention.  However, the story that ties all the various snippets together is rather creative.  It is somewhat predictable, yet it works for the movie and doesn't seem a bit out of place.  The actors performing the voices for the characters do an excellent job. Will Ferrell is a great Man in the Yellow Hat (Ted), Drew Barrymore has the perfect girl-next-door quality in her voice to deliver a very warm and loving Maggie, and [...] voice is perfect for the aging and overweight Museum owner and curator, Mr. Bloomsberry.  The soundtrack of the film is performed by Jack Johnson and his songs are a perfect mix for the action that occurs on screen.  Also, the creators of Curious George are given a nod in the film because the ship that Ted and George ride between the jungle and America is named the H.A. Rey.I found CURIOUS GEORGE to be rather charming.  It was very pleasant and peaceful.  I know it's a movie made pretty much strictly for kids, but adults with a childlike faith or an open mind might enjoy it as well.",4,Colorful Fun.,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,3945,"['When', 'was', 'young', 'child', 'never', 'read', 'Curious', 'George', 'books', 'heard', 'friends', 'was', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'saw', 'movie', 'FORREST', 'GUMP', 'checked', 'out', 'copy', 'original', 'CURIOUS', 'GEORGE', 'book', 'was', 'introduced', 'adventures', 'curious', 'little', 'monkey', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'found', 'George', 'exploits', 'entertaining', 'Sometimes', 'messages', 'were', 'overdone', 'often', 'found', 'comparing', 'how', 'George', 'got', 'trouble', 'character', 'different', 'series', 'children', 'book', 'librarian', 'used', 'read', 'Amelia', 'Bedelia', 'Anyway', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'George', 'Man', 'Yellow', 'Hat', 'thought', 'stories', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'animated', 'movie', 'series.I', 'learned', 'later', 'stories', 'had', 'indeed', 'many', 'made', 'series', 'sorts', 'However', 'was', 'feature-length', 'film', 'was', 'now.CURIOUS', 'GEORGE', 'movie', 'loosely', 'earliest', 'tales', 'Curious', 'George', 'also', 'plot', 'line', 'adults', 'whole', 'movie', 'together', 'Ted', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'City', 'Museum', 'Museum', 'financial', 'trouble', 'People', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'visiting', 'as', 'much', 'used', 'store', ""n't"", 'selling', 'many', 'items', 'restaurant', ""n't"", 'selling', 'much', 'food', 'fact', 'only', 'people', 'Ted', 'talk', 'are', 'group', 'preschoolers', 'Miss', 'Maggie', 'Dunlop', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'bringing', 'museum', 'week', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'talk', 'Ted', 'owner', 'museum', 'Mr.', 'Bloomsberry', '[', ']', 'afraid', 'will', 'have', 'sell', 'Mr.', 'Bloomsberry', 'son', 'Junior', 'David', 'Cross', 'hoping', 'will', 'have', 'sell', 'so', 'can', 'turn', 'museum', 'parking', 'lot', 'make', 'lots', 'lots', 'money', 'However', 'Ted', 'great', 'idea', 'finding', 'lost', 'idol', 'bringing', 'back', 'bring', 'business', 'Mr.', 'Bloomsberry', 'idea', 'sends', 'Ted', 'out', 'journey', 'find', 'lost', 'idol', 'supposed', 'be', 'three', 'stories', 'tall', 'way', 'Ted', 'yellow', 'suit', 'suckered', 'buying', 'meets', 'George', 'jungle', 'idol', ""n't"", 'accidentally', 'brings', 'George', 'back', 'U.S.Of', 'course', 'when', 'George', 'here', 'curious', 'everything', 'rich', 'woman', 'penthouse', 'apartment', 'colorful', 'pictures', 'blown', 'away', 'balloons', 'zoo', 'dinosaur', 'skeleton', 'Museum', 'collapse', 'George', 'Ted', 'bond', 'friendship', 'curious', 'little', 'monkey', 'Ted', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'love.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'try', 'kid', 'anyone', 'CURIOUS', 'GEORGE', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'mainly', 'kids', 'movie', 'bright', 'pallet', 'colors', 'quite', 'impressive', 'when', 'combined', 'style', 'animation', 'patterned', 'Curious', 'George', 'books', 'really', 'nice', 'look', 'part', 'appeal', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'bright', 'colors', 'are', 'sure', 'catch', 'keep', 'attention', 'However', 'story', 'various', 'snippets', 'together', 'rather', 'creative', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bit', 'place', 'actors', 'performing', 'voices', 'characters', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'great', 'Man', 'Yellow', 'Hat', 'Ted', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'perfect', 'girl-next-door', 'quality', 'voice', 'deliver', 'very', 'warm', 'loving', 'Maggie', '[', ']', 'voice', 'perfect', 'aging', 'overweight', 'Museum', 'owner', 'curator', 'Mr.', 'Bloomsberry', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'performed', 'Jack', 'Johnson', 'songs', 'are', 'perfect', 'mix', 'action', 'screen', 'Also', 'creators', 'Curious', 'George', 'are', 'given', 'nod', 'film', 'ship', 'Ted', 'George', 'ride', 'jungle', 'America', 'named', 'H.A', 'Rey.I', 'found', 'CURIOUS', 'GEORGE', 'be', 'rather', 'charming', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'peaceful', 'know', 'movie', 'made', 'pretty', 'much', 'strictly', 'kids', 'adults', 'childlike', 'faith', 'open', 'mind', 'might', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well']",N/A

All of them enjoyed George and even treasured a stuffed Curious George monkey as a Christmas gift.  So when we noticed Curious George on television we immediately introduced our grandchildren to the series.I ordered  this Curious George movie anticipating many hours of joy for my youngest  grandson.  My grandson watched the early parts of the movie then turned away.  It was simply not interesting to him.  I think the problem is too little George - he is not active early in the movie and does not seem to be the focus later.I have watched Curious George with my grandson on TV and he likes the program and  loves George.  However the TV program focuses upon George.  The other characters support him.  In this movie there is too much concentration upon the man with the yellow hat and how he found George.  That lost the child's attention.This may be a fine movie for older children but for children under six there simply is not enough George.  I hope the producers revise the focus in any future movies.,3,Wrong Focus,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,1082,"['.Many', 'years', 'ago', 'remember', 'reading', 'Curious', 'George', 'books', 'children', 'enjoyed', 'George', 'even', 'treasured', 'stuffed', 'Curious', 'George', 'monkey', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'So', 'when', 'noticed', 'Curious', 'George', 'television', 'immediately', 'introduced', 'grandchildren', 'series.I', 'ordered', 'Curious', 'George', 'movie', 'anticipating', 'many', 'hours', 'joy', 'youngest', 'grandson', 'grandson', 'watched', 'early', 'parts', 'movie', 'then', 'turned', 'away', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'interesting', 'think', 'problem', 'too', 'little', 'George', 'not', 'active', 'early', 'movie', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'focus', 'later.I', 'have', 'watched', 'Curious', 'George', 'grandson', 'TV', 'program', 'George', 'However', 'TV', 'program', 'George', 'other', 'characters', 'support', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'concentration', 'man', 'yellow', 'hat', 'how', 'found', 'George', 'lost', 'child', 'attention.This', 'may', 'be', 'fine', 'movie', 'older', 'children', 'children', 'six', 'simply', 'not', 'enough', 'George', 'hope', 'producers', 'revise', 'focus', 'future', 'movies']",N/A
