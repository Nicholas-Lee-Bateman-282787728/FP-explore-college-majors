Teslovich,"[0, 0]","Cast selection had a made-for-TV formula feel (stereotypes for a female cop and her cohorts; stereotypes of a salesman and motel personnel, etc.). The portrayals were unbelievable, robotic and overly scripted. Directing, editing and cinematography had that one person crew with a camera; jumping scenes; cheapness. Worst was the script in foisting an implausible series of events conjoined with the usual dumb investigative cops. Seemed like a Twinkie movie with not much of a beginning and not much of an end with even less in the middle.",1,Twinkie Movie,1340064000,"06 19, 2012",2012,539,"['Cast', 'selection', 'had', 'made-for-TV', 'formula', 'feel', 'stereotypes', 'female', 'cop', 'cohorts', 'stereotypes', 'salesman', 'motel', 'personnel', 'etc.', 'portrayals', 'were', 'unbelievable', 'robotic', 'overly', 'scripted', 'Directing', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'had', 'one', 'person', 'crew', 'camera', 'jumping', 'scenes', 'cheapness', 'Worst', 'was', 'script', 'foisting', 'implausible', 'series', 'events', 'conjoined', 'usual', 'dumb', 'investigative', 'cops', 'Seemed', 'Twinkie', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'beginning', 'not', 'much', 'end', 'even', 'less', 'middle']",Kate Logan Affair

While some people might think its cheesy and predicable, I for one enjoyed it immensely.  A rookie cop in a Canadian Town, makes a mistake in arresting a man that fits the description of a rapist that she had gotten a report about in the area.  What starts out as harmless innocent apology drinks between Kate and Mr. Gando, turns into a twisted situation after an accidental discharge of her firearm in a motel where Mister Gando was staying, and where Kate had been with him too.In my opinion, me as the viewer of this movie, felt bad for both Kate and Mr. Gando. her for wanting something she had found in him and him for his own reasons, but one mistake sends the couple on a spiraling out of control situation...Give the movie a shot, it might surprise you, in any event hope this review helps someone  decide on getting this movie.",5,Great Movie,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,916,"['Kate', 'Logan', 'Affair', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'know', 'recent', 'years', 'people', 'might', 'think', 'cheesy', 'predicable', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'rookie', 'cop', 'Canadian', 'Town', 'mistake', 'arresting', 'man', 'description', 'rapist', 'had', 'gotten', 'report', 'area', 'What', 'out', 'harmless', 'innocent', 'apology', 'drinks', 'Kate', 'Mr.', 'Gando', 'twisted', 'situation', 'accidental', 'discharge', 'firearm', 'motel', 'where', 'Mister', 'Gando', 'was', 'staying', 'where', 'Kate', 'had', 'been', 'too.In', 'opinion', 'viewer', 'movie', 'felt', 'bad', 'Kate', 'Mr.', 'Gando', 'wanting', 'something', 'had', 'found', 'own', 'reasons', 'one', 'mistake', 'couple', 'spiraling', 'control', 'situation', 'Give', 'movie', 'shot', 'might', 'surprise', 'event', 'hope', 'review', 'someone', 'decide', 'getting', 'movie']",Kate Logan Affair
1517352,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B006MHZ1NQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[0, 0]","With her perpetual look of wide-eyed innocence, it may be hard for actress Alexis Bledel to break away from her squeaky clean Gilmore Girl alter ego. She practically grew up in front of our eyes and I, for one, fell in love with her. As she moved into movies, she's had notable success sticking close to this TV persona (say Traveling Pants or the underrated Tuck Everlasting) in coming-of-age roles. But when she tries to break free from typecasting with edgier fare, the results are a bit more mixed (for example, a prostitute in Sin City). I don't fault her for wanting to take on the lead in the low budget Canadian project ""The Kate Logan Affair,"" but it's not a particularly easy fit. It doesn't help that the film's screenplay presents one of the most painfully overwrought and wildly unbelievable scenarios that you're likely to encounter. It's the equivalent of a Lifetime Network movie gone bad where the entire ""thriller"" element revolves around an event that poses no real suspense. Truth is, I never believed one second of this movie or one moment of Bledel's performance (which was sadly more grating than I'd like to think possible).Bledel plays a rookie cop (somewhat unconvincingly) who starts the film by making a false arrest on a visiting businessman played by Laurent Lucas. I knew I was in for trouble as this establishing sequence is so poorly executed. In an attempt to make amends, the two share a drink. Bledel and Laurent have no apparent sexual chemistry (he's like a kindly uncle in all their interactions), but that doesn't stop a torrid affair from beginning despite the fact he has a loving wife. I won't spoil the details of this increasingly preposterous thriller. Let's just say that a random mishap (which any rational person would have dealt with in about 15 minutes) leads the couple to go on the lam (which is ridiculous). The plot than veers into melodramatic overdrive as Bledel becomes desperate and conniving. The small initiating event escalates into a complete mental melt down.I enjoyed some of the lunatic plot twists in the film's final acts, but you have wade through so many annoying and repetitive scenes to get there. If you're going to make a bad movie, at least embrace its campiness and over-the-top unbelievability. That's what makes the aforementioned Lifetime movies more palatable, they aren't afraid to acknowledge their inherent silliness. ""The Kate Logan Affair"" plays it too straight. The DVD cover and advertising would have you believe that this movie is something entirely different than it is. It is less of a thriller and more about a pair of characters that make poor decisions. Ultimately, I didn't care much either way as the central driving plot point is so relatively insignificant. With unconvincing performances, plot developments, and dialogue--I can't really make this any sort of recommendation. I guess I'm feeling generous, though, I'll give it an extra star for the last minute twists.

New to the force officer Kate Logan (Bledel) stops someone she thinks matches the description of a killer. After realizing her mistake she offers to buy him a drink. The two soon begin an affair that leads to secrets and problems that make them regret meeting each other. I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this movie. It didn't really seem like a movie I would like, mostly because it seemed like it would be a ""Lifetime"" movie. It took about a half hour for anything of substance to happen and about an hour in for me to get interested. The ""twist"" at the end was OK but very predictable. My main problem with the movie is that the event that causes the spiral of events is so minor that it makes the movie a little unbelievable.
