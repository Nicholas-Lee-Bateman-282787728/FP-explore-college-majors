I was really reluctant to see it becuase I really do not care for Ashton Kutcher *he annoys me*, but his acting in this movie was actually very well done. The movie's plot revolves around a young man and his discovered ability to change the past by going back to key events in his life that shaped who he became. It's difficult to tell more without spoiling the movie. It really is worth viewing yourself. However, it does require close attention because it can be confusing at times. Also, the ending is wonderfully bittersweet and really tied together the film. A definite 5 star viewing.

818029,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B0001Z52RU,A. Estes,"[6, 6]","I went into Butterfly Effect with only one expectation: to see Ashton Kutcher in a serious role. After seeing him on &quot;That 70's Show,&quot; &quot;Punk'D&quot; and the deliciously stupid &quot;Dude Where's My Car?&quot; I was ready to see what the serious side of him could bring to the table. What I got with this film is more than I had bargained for. Sure, the previews promised a lot (and delivered on it), but this film is one of the most intense and gripping movies I have seen in a long time. First time directors  J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress do an outstanding job with the material, and although the initial premise is far-fetched, it's forgiven because of how the story sucks you in and makes you feel involved. Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a college student with a dark past, who can't remember key moments in his life because he simply blacked them out. He is told his dad is crazy, and as a child, sees him die. Evan's doctor told him to start writing journals when he was seven years old and when he reads a passage in the present day about a moment that he blacked out, he finds himself in a dream-like state where he is reliving the moment he couldn't remember. After a few experiences, Evan figures he can control these dreams and try to change things and maybe create a better future for him and his three childhood friends: Tommy (William Lee Scott), Lenny (Elden Henson) and most importantly, the girl he has loved since as long as he can remember (Tommy's twin sister) Kayleigh (Amy Smart). However, everytime Evan goes back in time, things in the present get shifted around severely, and most of the time, end up the worst. Evan finds himself going from frathouse to prison to wheelchair and each time he experiments, his window of hope for saving his friends seems to be waning. The most powerful scenes involve Evan's childhood, where we slowly watch how deranged Tommy can get, how disturbed Lenny can get, and how messed up Kayleigh's life can get. All of the actors in this film turn out exceptional performances. Obviously Kutcher does a great job, and is natural as Evan. But props must go to the underrated Amy Smart, who plays so many different characters in this movie and covers so much area. You can tell she put a lot into the role and it translates onto the screen. The movie (well, the theatrical cut) revolves around the love-story between Evan and Kayleigh, and basically serves as Evan's motivation. This movie is a bit disturbing, if you have certain childhood scars that you would rather not bring up, I wouldn't recommend this movie. But the bottom-line is &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; is a great movie and exceeds all expectations. The Director's Cut found on this DVD, is basically the original movie, with some cut-scenes pasted here and there (and it's easy to see why some of these were cut) and a completely different ending. Personally, I liked the original ending better. It just seems to end perfectly, exactly the way it should. But The Director's Cut, while being risky and bold, just doesn't seem to fit. But, it's all open for interpretation. The extras are somewhat disappointing. The extra deleted scenes are always nice and the commentary from the directors is rather interesting, but there isn't much else going on.",5,&quot;I'll come back for you.&quot;,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,3285,"['went', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'only', 'one', 'expectation', 'see', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'serious', 'role', 'seeing', 'quot', '70', 'Show', 'quot', 'quot', 'Punk', ""'D"", 'quot', 'deliciously', 'stupid', 'quot', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Car', 'quot', 'was', 'ready', 'see', 'what', 'serious', 'side', 'could', 'bring', 'table', 'What', 'got', 'film', 'more', 'had', 'bargained', 'Sure', 'previews', 'promised', 'lot', 'delivered', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'gripping', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'First', 'time', 'directors', 'J.', 'Mackye', 'Gruber', 'Eric', 'Bress', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'material', 'initial', 'premise', 'far-fetched', 'forgiven', 'how', 'story', 'feel', 'involved', 'Kutcher', 'Evan', 'Treborn', 'college', 'student', 'dark', 'past', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'key', 'moments', 'life', 'simply', 'blacked', 'out', 'told', 'dad', 'crazy', 'child', 'die', 'Evan', 'doctor', 'told', 'start', 'writing', 'journals', 'when', 'was', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'passage', 'present', 'day', 'moment', 'blacked', 'out', 'dream-like', 'state', 'where', 'reliving', 'moment', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'few', 'experiences', 'Evan', 'can', 'control', 'dreams', 'try', 'change', 'things', 'maybe', 'create', 'better', 'future', 'three', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Tommy', 'William', 'Lee', 'Scott', 'Lenny', 'Elden', 'Henson', 'most', 'importantly', 'girl', 'loved', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'Tommy', 'twin', 'sister', 'Kayleigh', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'However', 'everytime', 'Evan', 'back', 'time', 'things', 'present', 'get', 'shifted', 'severely', 'most', 'time', 'end', 'up', 'worst', 'Evan', 'going', 'frathouse', 'prison', 'wheelchair', 'time', 'window', 'hope', 'saving', 'friends', 'be', 'waning', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'involve', 'Evan', 'childhood', 'where', 'slowly', 'watch', 'how', 'deranged', 'Tommy', 'can', 'get', 'how', 'disturbed', 'Lenny', 'can', 'get', 'how', 'messed', 'up', 'Kayleigh', 'life', 'can', 'get', 'actors', 'film', 'turn', 'out', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'Obviously', 'Kutcher', 'great', 'job', 'natural', 'Evan', 'must', 'go', 'underrated', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'who', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'characters', 'movie', 'covers', 'so', 'much', 'area', 'can', 'tell', 'put', 'lot', 'role', 'screen', 'movie', 'well', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'love-story', 'Evan', 'Kayleigh', 'basically', 'serves', 'Evan', 'motivation', 'movie', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'have', 'certain', 'childhood', 'scars', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'bring', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'bottom-line', 'quot', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'quot', 'great', 'movie', 'expectations', 'Director', 'Cut', 'found', 'DVD', 'basically', 'original', 'movie', 'cut-scenes', 'pasted', 'here', 'there', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'cut', 'completely', 'different', 'ending', 'Personally', 'liked', 'original', 'ending', 'better', 'just', 'end', 'perfectly', 'exactly', 'way', 'should', 'Director', 'Cut', 'being', 'risky', 'bold', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'open', 'interpretation', 'extras', 'are', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'extra', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'always', 'nice', 'commentary', 'directors', 'rather', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'going']",N/A

I will say that it is one of the finest science fiction movies of the last 20 years.  It even crosses genres into drama and suspense.  Like most movies of its kind, there may be some problems of logic and a contradiction here and there, but overall the writing, directing, and acting is great.  For those of us who wonder ""what if"" about many things in our past or regret the past from time to time it gives us a lot to reflect on.  The characters are deep and sympathetic.Many of the critics who say the movie is too graphic or sadistic(i.e. child porn and animal cruelty) probably have not really seen the entire movie.  These subjects are only touched upon briefly and are condemned rather than glorified.  I do recommned it only for adults or those in their late teens.

818034,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B0001Z52RU,alex bushman,"[4, 10]","Why is the trailer excellent?  It decieves you into thinking that certain events happen out of order and at least that mislead has brought some attention to the film because otherwise this fish is dead in the water.  The biggest reason that I can point to the directing.  It's absolutely terrible.  I never had a sense of place within this film whether it was outside, inside, obviously on a set.  These places didn't feel like anything.  The film doesn't establish moods, or opinions about much of anything and that is the fault of the director. I didn't sense any kind of importance, or relevance to the events that happened within the first five minutes and within ten I was passively wishing this was over.  The editing was cold and mechanical when the only way that this would've worked would've been as a personal study (it doesn't the script, or brains to put off a competent sci fi, I'll get to that later).  Sound is the only thing the directors did partially well.  I say partially because when the actors couldn't keep attention on the screen the sound jumped out and got it, but after awhile it became revealed as a cheap trick to simply replace emotional development. What's worse is that in some scenes which are meant to be disturbing, they have surround sound of a crowd laughing and it's so loud that it actually sounds like the crowd in the theater is laughing at the film, just plain bad.  As for the acting, I think that the direction does the performances a disservice, but the casting director is just as much to blame for some obvious miscasts, or maybe they wouldn't be miscasts if the script gave them something interesting to say, or if it was plausible and the actors were being directed by good artists.  There are some whole within the plot and I'm sure that they're intentional.  1) If his father had this power to travel back in time than why is it that the blackouts that Kutcher's character indures within his life are only his own tamperings later in life. 2)If he simply goes back by concentrating on the events that happened in his journals which are actually his memories then why can't he go back by simply remembering?  3)what seven year old boy keeps a journal in today's day and age? 4)If he wrote all of these old journals for such a long time, why is it that he never reads them until after the blackouts stop? 5)If he can go back through time and change events, therefore changing history and his memories then it's not possible that he could save those memories of himself changing, or that they had been changed at all.  He might even forget about his ability to change things, otherwise, it doesn't make sense for his brain to be bleeding. 6)The quote at the beginning suggests that the butterfly effect can be catstrophic and because its effects are limited to the lives of only a few people and not the surroundings and/or entire world it really doesn't fulfill its potential. Ditto on the movie, but Kutcher was a passable actor in the main role. Also, the movie is an empty nuggett because it goes out of its way at the end to say that certain talents are better left unused, if that's the lesson then why waste my time showing them being used haphazardly and only having them work out at the end in service of the plot? On the plus side, I didn't hate it and just felt empty at the end, in a sedated way.",1,This is a bad movie with an excellent trailer,1075507200,"01 31, 2004",2004,3356,"['Why', 'trailer', 'excellent', 'thinking', 'certain', 'events', 'happen', 'out', 'order', 'least', 'mislead', 'brought', 'attention', 'film', 'otherwise', 'fish', 'dead', 'water', 'biggest', 'reason', 'can', 'point', 'directing', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'never', 'had', 'sense', 'place', 'film', 'was', 'outside', 'inside', 'obviously', 'set', 'places', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'film', ""n't"", 'establish', 'moods', 'opinions', 'much', 'anything', 'fault', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'sense', 'kind', 'importance', 'relevance', 'events', 'happened', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'ten', 'was', 'passively', 'wishing', 'was', 'over', 'editing', 'was', 'cold', 'mechanical', 'when', 'only', 'way', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'personal', 'study', ""n't"", 'script', 'put', 'off', 'competent', 'sci', 'fi', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later', 'Sound', 'only', 'thing', 'directors', 'did', 'partially', 'well', 'say', 'partially', 'when', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'attention', 'screen', 'sound', 'jumped', 'out', 'got', 'became', 'revealed', 'cheap', 'trick', 'simply', 'replace', 'emotional', 'development', 'What', 'worse', 'scenes', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'disturbing', 'have', 'surround', 'sound', 'crowd', 'laughing', 'so', 'loud', 'actually', 'crowd', 'theater', 'laughing', 'film', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'acting', 'think', 'direction', 'performances', 'disservice', 'casting', 'director', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'blame', 'obvious', 'miscasts', 'maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'miscasts', 'script', 'gave', 'something', 'interesting', 'say', 'was', 'plausible', 'actors', 'were', 'being', 'directed', 'good', 'artists', 'are', 'whole', 'plot', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'re"", 'intentional', '1', 'father', 'had', 'power', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'why', 'blackouts', 'Kutcher', 'character', 'indures', 'life', 'are', 'only', 'own', 'tamperings', 'later', 'life', '2', 'simply', 'back', 'concentrating', 'events', 'happened', 'journals', 'are', 'actually', 'memories', 'then', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'simply', 'remembering', '3', 'what', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'journal', 'today', 'day', 'age', '4', 'wrote', 'old', 'journals', 'long', 'time', 'why', 'never', 'blackouts', 'stop', '5', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'change', 'events', 'therefore', 'changing', 'history', 'memories', 'then', 'not', 'possible', 'could', 'save', 'memories', 'changing', 'had', 'been', 'changed', 'might', 'even', 'forget', 'ability', 'change', 'things', 'otherwise', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'brain', 'be', 'bleeding', '6', 'quote', 'beginning', 'butterfly', 'effect', 'can', 'be', 'catstrophic', 'effects', 'are', 'limited', 'lives', 'only', 'few', 'people', 'not', 'surroundings', 'and/or', 'entire', 'world', 'really', ""n't"", 'fulfill', 'potential', 'Ditto', 'movie', 'Kutcher', 'was', 'passable', 'actor', 'main', 'role', 'Also', 'movie', 'empty', 'nuggett', 'way', 'end', 'say', 'certain', 'talents', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'unused', 'lesson', 'then', 'why', 'waste', 'time', 'showing', 'being', 'used', 'haphazardly', 'only', 'having', 'work', 'out', 'end', 'service', 'plot', 'plus', 'side', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'just', 'felt', 'empty', 'end', 'sedated', 'way']",N/A

818037,A1VHK9A4VLJTHC,B0001Z52RU,"Amazon Customer ""Michael S. Beverly""","[1, 1]","This  film takes the ""what if"" question to an extreme, and in order to illustrate it, it uses extremely radical situations to provide the story line.  Of course, mundane life changes wouldn't make much of a movie, so I didn't have a problem with the subject matter, which includes child molestation, child porn, suicide, mental institutions and the like.  I didn't find anything too graphic or too disturbing, and I think the directors got the point across without crossing any lines.The script for this film was excellent and I believe the acting was first rate.Without going into the actual story, the basic premise is that a college student studying the human memory and how it works, finds a way to alter the past and thus change the future (his current present state).  Unlike basic time travel stories, where the person traveling in time actually goes back (or forward) in his own body, in this story, the character simply shows up in a scene in his body as it was at the time, but with his ""current"" mind and knowledge.  From that vantage point, he tries to alter a horrible event by saying or doing something that will change the event enough to change the future for the better.Of course the film, like all good drama, is an interesting movie because every time the character tries to reach his goal something gets screwed up and things get worse.I think the power of this film, and its redeeming quality, is the fact that while we (or at least most of us) believe that it is impossible to change the past, the reality is that small choices we make today can have dramatic effects on our future and those around us.  The real message of the movie (in my opinion)  is to make the right choices now, in the present, because even small errors in judgment at the present can mushroom into major problems later.I give a strong recommendation to this movie, it is disturbing in many ways, but well worth seeing.",5,Thought provoking movie,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,1914,"['film', 'what', 'question', 'extreme', 'order', 'illustrate', 'extremely', 'radical', 'situations', 'provide', 'story', 'line', 'course', 'mundane', 'life', 'changes', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'subject', 'matter', 'child', 'molestation', 'child', 'porn', 'suicide', 'mental', 'institutions', 'like', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'too', 'graphic', 'too', 'disturbing', 'think', 'directors', 'got', 'point', 'crossing', 'lines.The', 'script', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'believe', 'acting', 'was', 'first', 'rate.Without', 'going', 'actual', 'story', 'basic', 'premise', 'college', 'student', 'studying', 'human', 'memory', 'how', 'way', 'alter', 'past', 'thus', 'change', 'future', 'current', 'present', 'state', 'basic', 'time', 'travel', 'stories', 'where', 'person', 'traveling', 'time', 'actually', 'back', 'forward', 'own', 'body', 'story', 'character', 'simply', 'up', 'scene', 'body', 'was', 'time', 'current', 'mind', 'knowledge', 'vantage', 'point', 'alter', 'horrible', 'event', 'saying', 'doing', 'something', 'will', 'change', 'event', 'enough', 'change', 'future', 'better.Of', 'course', 'film', 'good', 'drama', 'interesting', 'movie', 'time', 'character', 'tries', 'reach', 'goal', 'something', 'screwed', 'up', 'things', 'get', 'worse.I', 'think', 'power', 'film', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'fact', 'least', 'most', 'believe', 'impossible', 'change', 'past', 'reality', 'small', 'choices', 'make', 'today', 'can', 'have', 'dramatic', 'effects', 'future', 'real', 'message', 'movie', 'opinion', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'now', 'present', 'even', 'small', 'errors', 'judgment', 'present', 'can', 'mushroom', 'major', 'problems', 'later.I', 'give', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'many', 'ways', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

In fact, the reason I refused to see the film in theaters was because I thought that there was no way he could pull off a good performance. Yes, I was wrong. Though I do not think the role that he played was too hard, I do think that he was more than suitable to star the role.In this provacative film, Kutcher plays the role of a person who is basically able to travel through time which in turn, alters the outcome of his life, as well as the lives of the people closest to him. In his youth, he represses a lot of disturbing memories, but keeps them stuffed in journals, in hopes it may decrease the number of blackouts that he has (which seemd to come conveniently at times when he'd cause trouble). By the time he reaches college, the blackouts are gone. Then one night, he stumbles across one of his old journals and reads it aloud, resulting in his first blackout in years. He soon discovers that he holds the power to travel through time back! In particular, he is able to race back through time to the points in his life where he blacked out. He plays with his power and learns that he can change the past and does so multiple times in order to change the future--mostly to change the outcome of a person he loves most. It seems as though no matter how many times he goes back to change something, it all leads to something dramatically different than what he expected.Entertaining and mind boggling. The art in this film does not necessarily come from the cinematography, the editing techniques, or the directing in particular. I would say this is more of a film that challenges the mind to think about the longterm consequences of our actions. Something so technical as the words and the order that we use them could in turn effect the outcome of a person's life. Even more so, one action at a single stage in a youth's life can dramatically effect the outcomes of others.

A bunch of convuluted mixed up crap. Starring Ashton Kutcher who I think should stick to TV and shows like ( That 70s show ) instead of trying to be a film actor because he just dosent cut it. Hes better at comedy. He dosent give a good performance as a serious actor nor did i buy it. Amy Smart was mediocre in this role. The whole film was mediocre at best, barely watchable. Long tedious and boring. Ashton Kutcher stars as a college kid who keeps revisiting his past and going back in time through a notebook he kept when he was younger. The movie is basically about what would happen if he did somthing diffrent in his past and what would happen if he could change it and the situations it would lead to and how it would affect peoples lives. No matter how he changes it the outcome always seems to be bad. Him and his mother encounter a fortune teller during the movie that says something to the extent of you were never meant to be born or you dont have a soul. It all comes together at the end of the film. During all this nonsense he keeps re reading his notebook and starts to go into a transe and his nose starts bleeding. Very lame.

818046,A26O6MQFA36WBK,B0001Z52RU,A Reviewer,"[5, 5]","I was not expecting much when I saw this movie on TV a while ago, but I was amazed by it. The Butterfly Effect is a great movie on every level. Great storyline, compelling characters, great acting, (even from the young cast,) great soundtrack, great directing, great storytelling.....just a great movie.Evan realizes at a young age that he has blackouts during some disturbing events in his childhood. After a seriously messed up childhood, the movie then cuts to him at college. He finds some old journals, and learns that he can go back in time using them to view events that were previously blacked out. He eventually learns that he can change events in the past. Every time he tries this, though, to save the life of a friend, he ends up making things much worse for everyone, including himself. Each time he travels back in time to change something, something goes very wrong in the present.This movie isn't for those who can't take disturbing themes. There's a lot of them in this movie, and plenty of violence too. But there's something admirable about how this movie completely avoids doing what's usually expected of a Hollywood movie. The endings, (both theatrical and director's cut) are not happy endings, both involving sacrifice by the main character to make those he loves live happy lives.The Butterfly Effect is always interesting because it goes to both the young life, teenage life, and adult life of its main characters. Luckily, the acting is great for each part of the movie, and the tight storytelling always keeps the film intense and interesting. (Especially in the theatrical version.) Overall, a very good film that leaves a great impression on you after it's finished.The DVD comes with 2 versions; Theatrical version, (the one shown in movie theaters) and the Director's Cut version, which features the movie ""how the directors would want to watch it."" This includes about 6 minutes of additional scenes and a different, MUCH darker ending. One version is on one side of the disc, and the other version's on the other. It was a great idea to include both versions, because people will definitely disagree on which ending is the better one.Since I saw this movie on TV, (Which was the theatrical one,) I was luckily spared the difficult choice of which version to watch first. But I highly recommend the theatrical version. By eliminating some scenes that completely slow down the plot, the theatrical version's pacing is much better. And the ending...well, yeah, it's definitely the less dark of the 2 of them, but somehow, despite usually liking dark endings, I thought the theatrical ending was better. I know it wasn't how the directors originally planned to end the film, but it just seemed so much more well-thought out than the Director's Cut ending. The Director's Cut ending, while attempting to portray sacrifice and make it heroic, just ended up coming off as depressing and the ""easy way out."" If I had seen the movie with the Director's Cut ending first, I would have thought that they ""just didn't know how to end the film, and this was an idea that they came up with the last minute."" The theatrical version, though, gets the same message across, but it seemed to fit much more organically into the clockwork plot. And to tell the truth, the way Evan ""fixes everything"" in the theatrical version (at that party) was more sad to me than the events that took place in the director's cut ending, which just seemed cold and unnecessary.So anyway, some will like one ending, some will like the other one. I thought the theatrical ending, while not as dark, was definitely the better ending.

Ryan ""Merribelle""","[9, 10]","""Oh goodie, another teenage movie featuring the pretty-boy-of-the-moment"", was my thought when my husband brought home The Butterfly Effect last night.  He rarely picks anything I would have, although about half the time his selections surprise me by being good.  Happily this turned out to be one of those situations.TBE is about a boy growing up under a peculiar curse; he has occasional blackouts, during which he does things that he cannot remember afterwards and which usually traumatize everybody around him.  They often come at key moments of his life that end up in disaster before he comes back to himself.  CAT scans of his brain show no organic disorder.  Hypnosis doesn't reveal much.  His mom and circle of friends learn to accept him and cope with him, and he grows up with some strong friendships until he has to move at age 14.  That's the last he hears from them until he revisits childhood sweetheart seven years later.  Her life has been a downward spiral since he left and after he leaves this time she commits suicide.  Remorse drives him to reexamine his childhood journals for clues and answers to why things got so bad, and he makes a disturbing discovery:  he can travel back in time to those blackout periods and redo them.  The question now becomes, should he?  Because on every one of those ""trips"", his tampering has unexpected, horrible results for one or more of his loved ones.I never used to think much of Ashton Kutcher, for better or for ill, but TBE changed my mind about him.  He proved that he can play a smart, compelling character with a good range of emotions.  I believe that Kutcher may have a future in Hollywood aside from the himbo roles he's been stuck with up until now.  Let's hope some casting directors agree.My final opinion of TBE is that it is a somewhat dark, but well done film.  The plot is not perfect (toward the end there is a big plot hole that I won't reveal so I don't spoil it for you) but it does raise intelligent questions for the viewer to ponder on the long-term consequences of everything we do and what moments in our lives really decide who we will become.  It was also engaging on a more gut level that I can't explain, but I enjoyed the entire hour and fifty five minutes.

I don't say things like that often, and I don't use words lightly.This movie just smacks you in the face time after time with insulting nonsense. Throughout the entire film I feel extremely uncomfortable. And not in the good way that you enjoy from a film. Maybe that's what they were looking to do when they made this thing, make people uncomfortable. No, thanks. If someone finds this stuff fun or enjoyable, then there is a problem with the person emotionally or psychologically.Child pornography, drug abuse, cruelty to animals, and unspeakable graphic violence from kids are all things that lurk in our deepest nightmares (or on the six o'clock news broadcasts). But here they are, presented for your approval as entertainment. Not my idea of a good night at the movies.I would feel differently if this film really raised some worthwhile issues, or had a truly riveting story to tell, or contained fascinating and richly drawn characters, or painted an emotionally satisfying picture. It does none of these things.Each fantastic and twisted scenario presented gets worse and worse. This is really just an exercise in sensational shock value. 'How can we freak the audience out for a couple of hours', this film seems to ask. And even when the film seems to be going in a positive direction it is all too brief and too late for all the negative crap it has already spewed at its audience.People who love this film should reexamine why they do. It may be just for cheap and easy thrills. This movie flirts with science fiction and aims to be high psychological drama. It fails, big time. People say ""Wow, this film really blew my mind"". Fine. Yes, it's all very freaky and disturbing stuff. But does that equal a good film? No. There are other psychological films that succeed way beyond this junk, movies that are thought provoking, entertaining, and fascinating, that don't pander to the lowest or go for cheap jolts. I would advise people to avoid this movie unless they enjoy staring at awful car wrecks for long periods of time.The worst part for me is that this could have been a really fascinating and interesting film (rather than a stupid shock ride), because it plays with such intriguing concepts and ideas: time travel and altering the past to change the future.

I was not disappointed.The plot revolves around Evan (Ashton Kucher) a psychology major in college, whose childhood was plagued by blackouts. Although psychologists and neuroscientists can find nothing physically wrong with him, they suggest Evan keep journals to catalogue his daily doings and perhaps pin down the source of the blackouts. His last blackouts occur at approximately the age of 13, and he is then blackout-free until he reaches college.One night, however, he is cajoled into reading one of his old journals, and perhaps serendipitously, randomly selects a particularly traumatic and gruesome episode from his past. He is transported back in time - to age 13, with a sudden awareness that he can do this at will and alter the past. Of course, Evan tries to right all the wrongs that he let go on in his past, all with the best of intentions, but unfortunately, each seemingly small alteration to the past that Evan, age 13 does, has exponentially multiplying consequences for Evan, age 20.Ultimately, this movie is sort of a more violent and darker version of the time-travel themes explored in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; movies, or the TV series &quot;Sliders.&quot; I believe even an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; was similar in concept.

818052,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0001Z52RU,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Butterfly Effect is a pretty interesting suspense.  The pacing is highly original and different from anything I've ever seen before.  If you think Ashton Kutcher plays a comedian here, guess again!  This is a suspense from beginning to end with several twists and turns giving it plenty of replay value.  Not the kind of movie you're used to seeing starring Ashton Kutcher, that's for sure.It's about Ashton having the ability to travel back in time and change certain traumatic events so they never happen, leading to the future events to play out differently.  Quite often he changes things for the worse but it's not realized until later on in surprising fashion.  This is the theme throughout the ENTIRE film.  Some like it, others don't.  To give one example, a girl who's molested by her father ends up having a rough lifestyle as an adult.  However in one segment Ashton goes back and changes this, so now she's a more respectable and likeable woman in the future.  This is just one example- there's a LOT more.  If I reveal every single one, I'd end up spoiling the entire film.  Ashton is the only one who does the time travelling however- but his 3 friends (a girl and two boys all with their own highly unusual personalities) have their own disturbing dilemmas.Now when I say Ashton travels back in time, he's not using a time machine or anything like that.  Instead the movie opts for simple ""blink of the eye"" time travelling after Ashton reads certain lines from a notebook.  One second he's an adult, the next he's back in time as a child and changing the future with his friends.  Really cool special effects are briefly used so the viewers can see the actual travelling.Now, you're probably wondering what kind of horrible traumatic events ARE we seeing?  Well to name the main ones- the kids blow up a mailbox using dynamite that leads to a few deaths, the one blonde-haired boy tortures a trapped dog tied up in a bag, and of course, the girl being molested.  Ashton goes back in time and changes these events.For the first 20 minutes you'll probably be REALLY confused but please, stick with the entire thing.  The storyline pretty much demands your entire attention.  Highly recommended.

We are led to believe the young twenty-year-old man is reliving his past in flashbacks -- at first. He'd apparently led such a troubled, neglected life in his childhood and growing-up years it had left him in a tramatized state of insanity.  This is filled with unknowns as actors (the only bright spot was Logan Lerman who reminded me of my son Zach at that age); it is so positively dark that Tim Burton or Justin Lin should have been the director. In fact, this is the American version of Better Luck Tomorrow.It is a movie of ""what if's"". There is no guarantee that life would be any better if we could change things. Yet, this boy uses some entries in journals covering thirteen years to try to rectify the wrongs which were done to him or he was involved in causing. Sometimes, it is reflective of the lowlife of society, with scenes in prison, college dorms, teenage pranks which exploded into criminal activity. It was always 'what if I had done this or that.'  At the Park theater there in Briarville, New York, we watch a movie within a movie -- very distracting, as was that infernal necklace he wore throughout the entire film. His computer in the dorm room is never turned on, so why'd he have one? He's always hoarding the composition books he calls journals. But does he really have journals. That's the big question.Those were weird characters in the bar. He always seemed to attract strange roommates (in prison it was a religious freak as his cell mate). The prison scene was a nightmare. The macabre ending in his dreams echoed his dreaming about all the bad things he'd experienced and how he'd go about changing them in several dream fantasies. Guess that's where the 'butterfly effect' came in -- flitting from one strange incidence to another.  It was hard to decided whether he was on the brink of insanity or completely around the bend like his father who had died at Sunnyvale Mental Institution. Had he inherited his 'father's curse'? There was some fleeting nudity in the shower scene and plenty of crude language.No matter what life holds for a human, there is no going back -- no perfect life. In his warped mind, he returns to his past to redeem the hurts perpetrated on him. He discovers that mental illness is worse than death.  This was a very disturbing movie and not pleasant to watch.

The idea that if you can travel back in time you can change the future is by no means a novel idea. What's unique here is the movie's overall darkness. There are several different alternate realities each one done with incredible detail.This movie has the best inside prison scenes I've ever seen ina movie. I learned from watching the movie with the directors' commentary that it was filmed in in a real prison, and the extras were real prisoners.  Incredible.I've noticed a lot of subtle things in the movie that the directors didn't even mention in their commentary (which is well worth listening to).The DVD is doublsided and contains two versions of the movie. The Theatrical release version and the Director's Cut which is the movie the way the directors original wanted it to be seen. Luckily I watched the Director's cut, not realizing how signficant the differences are. It turns out to be a good thing that I never watched this movie in the theater, because the Director's Cut on the DVD is by far superior to what was shown in the theater.The movie was filmed with a relatively low budget, only $13 million, which explains some of the negatives people may have. A $26 million movie has a little more in the way of slickness, a little more leeway to take more time in filming and get better performances from the actors by having more takes to choose from. Nevertheless, I had no idea that I was watching a ""bad performance"" until I read reviews after watching the movie.This is the best movie I've watched in many months.

818062,APP5MBH2BSX6I,B0001Z52RU,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[0, 0]","""The Butterfly Effect"" is many things at once.  It is violent, disturbing, sweet, sad, funny, horrifying, redemptive, and touching.  It is also a badly flawed gem that hints at being a masterpiece in screaming need of a story editor.First, the best news about this unique sci-fi story (the science in this case being medical science).  Ashton Kucher, co-producer, is surprisingly believable as Evan, the young man inflicted with a congenital brain disorder that causes him to black out at stressful moments.  This early part of his life is played by two other younger actors, both of whom are equally credible.  This disorder also, as Evan finds later in life, allows him to be transported back in time to embody the younger versions of himself during those stressful moments, so that he can take a different action than he originally did, thereby changing his history and that of those around him.If Evan hadn't had such a quasi-Dickensian life, this would never come to the forefront, apparently.  But his father ""ain't quite right,"" as we learn in the first scene when he's told that his daddy can't come to parents day at school because ""it would be too dangerous for him.""  Add the influence of the equally dysfunctional family that includes his friends Tommy, Kayleigh (adult version played nicely by Amy Smart in four or five different alternate realities), and their dad (an appropriately warped Eric Stolz), and Evan and his friends are scarred for life in several unpleasant ways during their Wonder Years.  When this all leads to one character's suicide, Evan decides to go back and change things and set it all right.Thus the story shows us repeatedly that the Shakespearean cliche is true about the best laid plans of mice and men oftimes going astray.  By the time Evan figures out how to really make it all right for everybody, he realizes that, in so doing, he must make a sacrifice that he didn't see coming.Overall the story is a real winner, despite the unpleasantness that turned off so many viewers.  For me, the unpleasantness never become overly oppressive because there's always a sense of hope, thanks to Kucher's energetic (but not too hammy) performance.  Aside from the brutal language and violence, the monstrously gaping holes in story logic are what puts me off from considering this to be a legit favorite.  For instance, in each alternative reality Evan's journals are there, the touchstone he uses to transport himself back into his blackouts.  What, multiple changes of reality didn't change his journals?!  I'll not go into detail about some of the other goofy lapses in common sense that are here, but suffice to say the film suffers by making the viewer frequently frown and say ""What?!""As for the ending, there are at least four.  The PPV version of the film I saw on DirectTV showed three, and I understand the ""director's cut"" ending is much more depressing than any of these three.  Personally I'm glad I didn't see that one.  The ending that features two major characters walking away from each other is perfect, and was presented on PPV as being THE ending (I understand this is the ending shown in theaters).  The alternative endings included one where one character follows the other (yeah, but what happens when the other turns around?) and the other features the two characters meeting and agreeing to go somewhere together (with one of the worst lines of dialogue I've heard this year).  I don't have any desire to see the director's cut ending, wherein Evan goes back to the womb and kills himself, thus ensuring that he never has to experience the pain he goes through in his life but leaving everyone else to their own misery.  What a depressing, selfish copout.This film is obviously a matter of taste, more so than most are.

Son,"[2, 2]","""If a butterfly flaps its wings on one side of the world, the ripple effect could cause a tempest on the other."" --Chaos TheoryStarting off with a quote of the Chaos Theory. Background info about the quote and theory. ""The flapping of a single butterfly's wing today produces a tiny change in the state of the atmosphere. Over a period of time, what the atmosphere actually does diverges from what it would have done"" (Ian Stewart, Does God Play Dice? The Mathematics of Chaos, pg. 141). So the movie is relating to the idea that a small, unseemingly insignificant action would cause drastic changes in the future.Ashton Kutcher plays a college student who had intermittent black-outs, periods of time that would be lost from memory, could be stirred and remembered simply by reading journal entries he wrote as a child to help him remember. Acting that seemed rushed and confused by younger actors, it depicts the life of a troubled boy, a brother and sister with a pedophile father, and a boy with extreme emotional problems all friends in horrible, graphic events. But by reading these journal events would cause him to go back in time, time-traveling if you want to call it, enabling him to change something in the past, thus rippling the change of the past to the future. Each time he would go back to the past and change something, it would result in a different situation in the future. He doesn't make small changes, but drastic ones, causing huge changes in the future. Not like the fluttering of a butterfly's wings but the sheer force of a hurricane permanently rearranging the once and preserved future.Ashton Kutcher puts a well-meaning performance, far atypical of his real-life and other acting personas (Punk'd, That 70's Show, Just Married...), in a genre that the audience has never seen. Though this may deter some to even watch this movie, the movie itself is so shocking and dramatic that the idea of Kutcher being the aloof Kelso is left far behind.The movie does what every movie should do: it keeps the audience wide-eyed for the movie, starting off strong with profound, twisted events, leaving the audience with morbid curiosity. Although R-Rated for intense, graphic situations and controversial issues, this movie may be too intense for some.The movie leaves the audience in a state of fascination, distraughtedness, and deep thought. The theme in the movie lends it one of the many, especially after watching either one of two versions: Director's Cut or Theatrical Presentation. (Director's Cut has a extremely odd ending, different from the Theatrical Presentation) Though one will get the idea that love drives us all to do anything for the sake of it, and the sheer realization that self-sacrifice is something we must all do in order to keep things in order.Great directing, and story builds great with minor holes. However it doesn't not finish it with finesse, leaving the audience more bewildered and distraught than a deer caught in headlights. Acting is subpar, seemingly rushed and lacking in focus. Though credit should be given to Ashton Kutcher and Melora Walters for their performance.",4,The Butterfly Effect,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,3129,"['butterfly', 'wings', 'one', 'side', 'world', 'ripple', 'effect', 'could', 'cause', 'tempest', 'other', 'Chaos', 'TheoryStarting', 'off', 'quote', 'Chaos', 'Theory', 'Background', 'quote', 'theory', 'flapping', 'single', 'butterfly', 'wing', 'today', 'tiny', 'change', 'state', 'atmosphere', 'period', 'time', 'what', 'atmosphere', 'actually', 'diverges', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'Ian', 'Stewart', 'Does', 'God', 'Play', 'Dice', 'Mathematics', 'Chaos', 'pg', '141', 'movie', 'relating', 'idea', 'small', 'unseemingly', 'insignificant', 'action', 'would', 'cause', 'drastic', 'changes', 'future.Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'had', 'intermittent', 'black-outs', 'periods', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'memory', 'could', 'be', 'stirred', 'remembered', 'simply', 'reading', 'journal', 'entries', 'wrote', 'child', 'help', 'remember', 'Acting', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'confused', 'younger', 'actors', 'life', 'troubled', 'boy', 'brother', 'sister', 'pedophile', 'father', 'boy', 'extreme', 'emotional', 'problems', 'friends', 'horrible', 'graphic', 'events', 'reading', 'journal', 'events', 'would', 'cause', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'time-traveling', 'want', 'call', 'enabling', 'change', 'something', 'past', 'thus', 'rippling', 'change', 'past', 'future', 'time', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'past', 'change', 'something', 'would', 'result', 'different', 'situation', 'future', ""n't"", 'make', 'small', 'changes', 'drastic', 'ones', 'causing', 'huge', 'changes', 'future', 'Not', 'fluttering', 'butterfly', 'wings', 'sheer', 'force', 'hurricane', 'permanently', 'rearranging', 'once', 'preserved', 'future.Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'well-meaning', 'performance', 'far', 'atypical', 'real-life', 'other', 'acting', 'personas', 'Punk', ""'d"", '70', 'Show', 'Just', 'Married', 'genre', 'audience', 'never', 'seen', 'may', 'deter', 'even', 'watch', 'movie', 'movie', 'so', 'shocking', 'dramatic', 'idea', 'Kutcher', 'being', 'aloof', 'Kelso', 'left', 'far', 'behind.The', 'movie', 'what', 'movie', 'should', 'do', 'audience', 'wide-eyed', 'movie', 'starting', 'off', 'strong', 'profound', 'twisted', 'events', 'leaving', 'audience', 'morbid', 'curiosity', 'R-Rated', 'intense', 'graphic', 'situations', 'controversial', 'issues', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'intense', 'some.The', 'movie', 'audience', 'state', 'fascination', 'distraughtedness', 'deep', 'thought', 'theme', 'movie', 'one', 'many', 'especially', 'watching', 'one', 'two', 'versions', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Theatrical', 'Presentation', 'Director', 'Cut', 'extremely', 'odd', 'ending', 'different', 'Theatrical', 'Presentation', 'one', 'will', 'get', 'idea', 'love', 'do', 'anything', 'sake', 'sheer', 'realization', 'self-sacrifice', 'something', 'must', 'do', 'order', 'keep', 'things', 'order.Great', 'directing', 'story', 'builds', 'great', 'minor', 'holes', 'However', ""n't"", 'not', 'finish', 'finesse', 'leaving', 'audience', 'more', 'bewildered', 'distraught', 'deer', 'caught', 'headlights', 'Acting', 'subpar', 'seemingly', 'rushed', 'lacking', 'focus', 'credit', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Melora', 'Walters', 'performance']",N/A

818072,A2VU1UE8IA0986,B0001Z52RU,Cavan Terrill,"[2, 3]","The Butterfly Effect, in many ways, comes off as a ""lite"" version of Donnie Darko - it explores similar premises with a less effective screenplay, less talented actors and a bigger budget. That said, The Butterfly Effect is still a relatively enjoyable movie. It won't provoke as much thought as Darko did, but that's largely because it's been heavily 'Hollywoodized'. As far as acting goes, Kutcher was quite good. As much as I like That 70s Show, it's nice to see him moving into roles that require more of him than simply replicating his role as Kelso. Amy Smart, however, didn't impress me at all and didn't do much for the film. In the supporting roles, Eric Stoltz was excellent as a [...] father and Ethan Suplee, who is one of my favorite supporting actors (you might have seen him in American History X, Cold Mountain or Remember The Titans) is onscreen for such a short time that he doesn't have much impact as Kutcher's goth roommate. The downside of this movie is that, if you start to think about it too hard, plot holes show up at every turn, so it's best to simply enjoy the movie on its own terms.Also, if you're watching the DVD version, I'd recommend watching the Director's Cut over the Theatrical Version.

At the beginging we see the childhood of Evan, Kayleigh, Tommy and Lenny, where Evan has occasional blackouts during certain tramatic times. Now this early stuff isn't particularly good, but it gets much worse.Evan, played as an adult by Kutchor, finds out he can go back to those certain blackout events and change events by reading his journal. Now the fact that they spend almost no time explaining how he does this doesn't bother me near as much as the obsurdity of the time changing outcomes. This movie is so over the top with every single major transition and almost always seems phoney. There's one decent performance by Amy Stuart who plays the adult Kayleigh, and love interest of Evan, but every other character is lined with overacting gibberish. Kutchor was definetly not the right person to play a psychotic, but to be fair the material is so dead that the best of actors couldn't save it.I really try to think about what other people who like this film are seeing, but the only positive thing I can really say about it is it kept my attension throughout, though it did so in a way that often made me squirm. It's not a bad movie I laughed at, it's just a bad movie. I wanted to stay for the ending, but that was ultimately as stupid as anything else the film had to offer.

818081,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B0001Z52RU,C. Middleton,"[3, 3]","This film is an excellent spin on a fascinating and well-trodden concept. If one scans their memory, it has been done many times before in numerous ways. There was that familiar Simpson's episode where old Homer, in his usual fashion, accidentally creates a time machine in an effort to fix the family toaster, merely stepping on a flower or insect in the distant past, thereby altering the very fabric of future society. There was also Richard Bach's much-underrated 80's novel, ""One"", describing his and his wife Leslie's travels through alternate realities and dimensions. This was a good novel. The basic premise for all these stories are essentially the same, and that is, the choices we make in life, however small or mundane, can have a tremendous effect on our future circumstances.The Butterfly Effect is a moral tale and a love story. Similar to H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, traveling back in time to prevent the death of a loved one or the destiny of a loved one will not always turn out the way we want it to. The moral message in the film, I believe, is that we are ultimately responsible for our own condition, and the choices we make in life determine our destinies. But what if we could travel back in time and change our choices? And by making different choices, how profoundly would it affect the outcome of our lives? This concept also begs the question - is our future pre-determined?Ashton Kutcher delivers a good performance as the reluctant and later, obsessive traveler of alternate time. This film showed me that Kutcher has talent as an actor and could well go far in the profession. The two younger versions of his character also put in excellent performances, particularly the younger one of the two. It was also a pleasure to see Eric Stoltz again, as the character showed me that Stolz could just about play anything with believability.This film certainly cranks along and remains compelling to the end. And the film's ending, really, could have gone in many directions. The conclusion the writer's chose, however, was appropriate, as it rounded out this chaotic and at times complex tale, leaving the audience with a sense of closure.

Smith ""Everything Fantasy & Horror""","[1, 1]","When I first found out Ashton Kutcher (Kelso in That 70s Show) was going to star in a serious intelligent horror movie as the sober main character I was just a little bit skeptical.  Then the movie hit the theaters and the critics hated it, now I'd become that much more skeptical.  However, despite all that I was intrigued by the premise of the movie and after about half a dozen other crappy recent horror movies I figured I didn't have anything to lose.  Let me state that this was by far one of the best psychological horror movies I've seen in a very long time.  Ashton Kutcher did a fantastic job.The premise for this movie is that Ashton's character has the ability to remember important events in his life and has the ability to return to the events in his life and change them.  Needless to say, once he starts it gets pretty crazy.  Any physicist will tell you that alterting past events could result in very drastic changes/consequences.  The whole cause and effect formula is put to good use in this movie.  Everytime Ashton plays around with things it always seems to turn out that much worse for him in the future.I love this movie for the amazing plot twists and reveletions that are thrown at you in abundance.  Throughout the entire movie you feel like you're constantly being inundated with fresh new content.  Never for a moment did I feel bored, nor could I ever successfully predict some of the outcomes.The usual acclaim goes towards this movie, great plot, good special effects, fantastic acting jobs, solid dialogue, etc.  Don't get me wrong people, this is a very twisted and disturbing movie.  Prepare to be shocked and utter the praise, ""What the hell?"" a lot.

It was nice to see Ashton Kutcher making the leap to the big screen and I give him full credit for putting his all into a difficult role. I liked the idea that by going back in time and trying to make things better, tiny deeds can set off unforeseen changes to everything that might come after. (Ray Bradbury used this theme well in his classic short story A Sound of Thunder.) In The Butterfly Effect, Kutcher's character returns again and again to his own past in order to try to right the wrongs that ruined the lives of a girl he loved, that girl's emotionally-unstable brother, and a third friend, who also goes on to a pathetic future that can be directly traced to the same key moments. The catch is, of course, that with each interference into the timeline, ripple effects occur and while certain areas of the existence of the four might improve, overall there are unacceptable consequences that inspire yet another trip backward. One weakness to this film was that there was little explanation or exploration of exactly how Kutcher's character was undertaking these jaunts into the past. That was left wide open and wasn't covered very well at all. I can respect saying that something ""just is"" and going on from there, but it still would have been nice had the means of his ability been fleshed out just a bit more. I also wondered why if the flashbacks to childhood were set (as revealed on a tombstone) in 1995, a relatively recent year, the hairstyles and fashions of the kids looked more like they were from the early `80's. Maybe a subtle effort to give the impression of distance between the latter-day events and the tragedies of once upon a time? Overall The Butterfly Effect was neither great science fiction nor a moving love story but it wasn't visual junk food either.

And boy, does he have reason to do so! There's a lot of grim stufff back there!Overall, the movie works fairly well, although it's pretty heavy-handed and Ashton Kutcher is no great shakes of an actor. He handles the lead role passably well, but it's no Oscar-level performance. And there are some places where Evan does things that are obviously stupid even at the time he does them; it's almost as if Kutcher's &quot;Kelso&quot; character from &quot;That '70s Show&quot; has taken over. Still, if you like movies of this genre, you'll probably be willing to overlook them. And Amy Smart shines as the ever-changing Kayley.If you're expecting greatness, look elsewhere.

818096,A216F4VHOTA9MJ,B0001Z52RU,Deafie,"[2, 2]","I knew I wanted to see this movie immediately when I learned it was taken from a previously published science fiction story about someone going back millions of years into time, accidentally stepping on a butterfly, and then returning to the present, only to discover the entire course of future history was changed because of that mistakenly killed butterfly.I thought originally the movie would be based on the written scifi  story due to the title containing the word 'butterfly', given the stepped-on butterfly in the published story. I was also told 6 months before this movie hit movie theaters by another friend who keeps up with the movie industry that it was connected to the published scifi story. When I saw the TV ads, they made me realize the movie would have nothing to do with the written scifi story; it would still touch on Chaos theory, but in a different way.Now I realize the butterfly is also a reference to the fact that every time Chaos theory is described, invariably the example is invoked of a butterfly's wing's moving air in one part of the world that ends up causing a hurricane in another part of the world. So, two different sorts of butterflies being invoked here simultaneously in the title.But I noticed that the DVD in its interviews refers to the butterfly of Chaos theory, and nowhere in the DVD is anything said about the science fiction story with the stepped-on butterfly in its plot, the only indication of its influence is how changing the past unavoidably changes the present too and the word 'butterfly' in its title.(Sorry, I don't have that written scifi story's title or author of that story with me off the top of my head as I'm typing this. I don't think the title of that story is 'The Butterfly Effect', it's likely something else. Maybe someone else's review can provide that information.)Back in college I had many talks with one friend in particular (we're both fans of scifi) about whether we could go back in time, but wouldn't that cause problems? When I saw this movie, I also watched with those past conversations in the back of my mind.Because I'm deaf, however, I was forced to wait until this movie reached DVD format, because I did not hear of it being shown with captions in movie theaters anywhere in my area.When I finally saw the movie on DVD, I felt it was well worth the wait!There are some scenes in the first half of the movie that seemed to make no sense. When I got to the second half of the movie the logic of those scenes that I thought strange suddenly became clear.I did hope that the real life Ashton, who plays the main character, would be a lot better than he is in his TV program. His program I don't really care for and have nearly always made a point of quickly clicking past it with my TV remote. I just don't understand how such drek is even allowed to exist on TV. Well, surprise! In this movie I think he's really terrific, a very serious and dramatic contrast to how he looks on TV.Hard to believe how many different versions the real life Melora (who plays Ashton's girlfriend in the movie) can act, are they all really the same person?? In one time line I barely even recognized her, I had to look twice, she was that incredible. She's obviously a marvelously skilled actress. I don't think I ever saw her before this movie.After Ashton goes back and changes time, there is a sudden rush of scenes in a brighter color, signifying new events and memories being formed as a result of some event in the past being changed, then the movie returns to normal colors and a newly-changed present. Those lighter-colored scenes occur very fast and I wasn't always sure of what I was seeing. When those particular scenes appear in the movie, you really have to have your eyes on the ball; look away just one instant or even merely blink, you've missed it. It was sometimes simply too rapid to cognitively process, at least for me, so I will have to go back and re-watch those scenes on the DVD to understand what I was seeing.I have to doublecheck to make sure I'm right, I could very well be wrong, I think the first time those lightly-colored scenes appear, the scenes flash by a little slower, later on in the movie I think they go by faster now that we know their meaning.About the three different endings on the DVD -- I didn't like the director's preferred ending that appears in the director's cut. I say this even though it was much more dramatic than the other two endings and left me thinking even more about what could go really wrong with changing one's past. In contrast, the theater release's ending, and the other ending that wasn't used, I preferred either of those. The best ending I preferred was the third alternative ending that was not used in the director's cut nor in the theater release, because it left open new possibilities.I devoured the entire DVD, not only watching the original theater release but also the two alternative endings and all of the other extras such as how the movie was made.Thank you, thank you, thank you, New Line Home Entertainment, for choosing to close caption the entire DVD including the interviews and how the movie was made! I really hate it when DVDs close-caption only the movie or TV episodes, then leave the rest of the DVD or DVD set (the interviews, etc.) virtually uncaptioned. (Perfect example: In Showtime's Queer as Folks' 2nd season DVD set, the episodes are all closed captioned on the first 5 DVDs, but nothing on the 6th and final DVD is closed captioned, and this is where the interviews, how the film was made, etc. are, and as a result, even though I enjoyed watching the first 5 DVDs in the set, in the end I felt upset and pissed off with Showtime.)I liked the Infinifilm version of the movie, a new technology I haven't seen before, thought it was interesting. The movie can be seen both outside and within the Infinifilm format. Don't remember which cut is the main one shown inside the Infinifilm format, the theater cut or the director's cut, but you can see the other two possible endings while within Infinifilm. At various points in the movie where a certain indicator appears briefly, if you choose to click your remote at that point before the indicator disappears and the movie then resumes, you get automatically and briefly switched to a portion of whatever interview touched on that part or a film short about how that part of the movie was made. At the end of that clip you get switched back and the film automatically resumes where it paused before.Speaking as a deaf person, the interview clips in the Infinifilm however are easier to understand and to follow only if the original interviews from which those clips were taken is seen in their entirety. (These interviews appear in full elsewhere on the DVD; I saw the clips first, before I saw the interviews, and then realized the clips had come out of these interviews.) The reason I emphasize being deaf here is that the close captions get messed up in the film clips inside the Infinifilm, while in the full interview format the same closed captions come across completely. Within the Infinifilm, sometimes the first sentence that's said and which should be closed captioned, doesn't appear in some of the film clips. The rest of the captions within each clip come out just fine.I finally realized this is probably an artifact of the Infinifilm technology that definitely needs to be fixed, and not a result of sloppy captioning, because the clips were clearly taken from the filmed interviews after the latter were already fully captioned, since the captioning in both is virtually identical.This problem disappeared if I ran the Infinifilm, and then used the remote to fast-forward straight from one short film clip to the next clip, and made a point of skipping watching any part of the movie itself within the Infinifilm format.If you're someone who seeks or needs captions, or know someone who's either, and seek a DVD that provides full access to all parts of it, not just the movie portion, this DVD is terrific. The closed captioning is top quality, and the accessibility of this DVD (aside from the small problem with the Infinifilm technology) is 100%.",5,Terrific movie; all portions of DVD fully accessible

Ashton Kutcher is, and always will be, a pinhead in my mind - Dude, where's my car?  Note that I loved that movie.  It is SO hard to take him seriously.  But I couldn't help it - this movie is excellent.  The script is GREAT, and the movie had me jumping out of my skin.  I won't reveal anything of the plot to you.  I guarantee you that once you see this movie, you will have to watch it once more, to catch what you missed the first time.The special effects were excellent, not over the top.

An awesome screenshot, proudly displaying a quote from the chaos theory graces the screen as a small blue butterlfy appears and flies away. Kutcher appears, panting, disheveled. Dimly lighted with a tint of royal, the scene takes off in a fury with the beginnings of the wonderful soundtrack that the film proudly displays.But it is downhill from there...And don't be fooled - the trailer is decieving.While I still maintain that the music saved the film (trust me, it was AMAZING), I almost felt like leaving. Not only were some of the most serious parts of the film laughable (and trust me, the room was laughing), but some parts were just darn lame. The dialogue was badly written, even if the script itself had potential. And that is the story of this film, uncarried out potential. The Chaos Theory and the Butterfly Effect (within the Chaos theory), which both state the if you change one thing, it changes everything, are both ambiguous and hardly discussable topics. It is no wonder that the film leaves the viewer with a yearning for something more.I have a severe problem with a previous reviewer's comparison to Memento and the Sixth Sense. If you have seen and liked Memento (one of the best films ever made, in my opinion), you will probably find the idea of The Butterfly Effect to be, at least, interesting. BUT, the two films are not even comparable. The Sixth Sense is also one of my favorite films. However, both Memento and The Sixth Sense have resolute, yet wonderfully ambiguous endings that will make you cringe and smile at the same time. The Butterfly Effect fails at this in all respects. It gets to the point where the viewer wonders how any ending could possibly save this movie. And the ending is as blase as one would think.Now, I'm not saying that the film was horrible - it was just bad. The acting is mediocre (despite a few horrendous miscasts, including Kutcher's character's mother), and the characters that you feel the closest to are not even main characters. While I almost cried for Kailey's (Amy Smart) brother, I did not once feel compassion for Ashton Kutcher.But the idea was so wonderful!If you are intrigued by the premise, give this film a shot. Maybe it has something going for that I am just completely missing. However, don't expect too much. It's nothing more than a step in the right direction for Ashton Kutcher and nothing less than a somewhat intriguing B movie.

818101,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B0001Z52RU,D. Mok,"[3, 3]","Critics of this movie have a point -- this story writes its own rules of logic and cause and effect.  If you don't accept its premise, then you will probably ridicule every twist and turn in the story.I accepted the premise, though, and though not all the pieces work, the resultant story was so unpredictable and unusual that I found myself quite engrossed.  I was in fact surprised that this film was directed by the writers of Final Destination 2, which I disliked.  But this time, I found myself drawn into this world of parallel realities and possibilities drawn up by directors/writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber.  Where Final Destination 2 was all shock tactics and gratuitous gore set pieces, The Butterfly Effect does its job much more by playing with your expectations and sympathies.The performances are fine, with Ashton Kutcher doing a good job playing college psych major Evan, whose memory blanks out at key points in his life, leaving black holes he must fill in for himself.  The character is basically a god-like figure with the ability to change the realities of everybody around him by manipulating his own decisions.  This alone makes for a fascinating character motivation -- not quite complete altruism, but a mad dash to save the people he loves.  Melora Walters, Elden Henson and William Lee Scott tackle multiple roles with good results, and central figure Amy Smart has never looked dreamier, giving a solid emotional motivation for Evan's character.  The switching of roles and characters is an oft-used TV device, but it's done with enough aplomb and variety here to make the exercise highly entertaining.If I have one grudge, it's the pacing.  The first act of the film lurches forward jarringly (though not without reason), and scenes are often a little too short.  As a result, it's a little hard to accept when the central conceit first happens; it's like we were set up for a psychological thriller and then the filmmakers cheated us into a supernatural solution.  Still, it was somewhat fun to be completely disoriented by the ""what the blazes?"" middle of the film, and after the initial lurches, the narrative moves forward quite nicely.Say what you will about this film, but you can't say it doesn't take risks.  And the script is smart enough to ground its very far-fetched premise with enough setups, payoffs, catharsis and danger that even if you don't buy the conceit, you probably won't be bored.

Why? For the very simple reason that Evan did NOT do any time-traveling whatsoever except in his own twisted mind, being a patient in a Psychiatric Facility!The key to the movie is the Psychiatrist's absolutely stunning revelation to Evan that there are NO notebooks, that he used these in his imagination in order to create Alternate Universes. Why? So as to escape the guilt of having been the instrument of killing his neighbor's young daughter for whom he had a puppy-love crush. l repeat: there were NO notebooks! Thus - no time travel except in his twisted mind! Evan is a certified crackpot, folks.As for the endings, 6 of one, half a dozen of the other: Director's Cut - he escapes either by killing himself (in another Alternate Universe)at birth and, it has to be assumed, fully withdrawing into himself for the rest of his life in the Sanitarium; or - Theatrical Release - as a youngster, he detaches himself fully from the young girl and her family, and everyone goes on to lead their own lives - no dynamite, no beatings, no killings, no prostitution, etc. Either way, nothing happens to Evan and his 3 friends.",5,Misunderstood Movie,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,1344,"['SPOILERS', 'l', 'finally', 'saw', 'excellent', 'movie', 'versions', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Theatrical', 'Release', 'l', 'also', 'read', 'bickering', 'ending', 'better', 'as', 'far', 'l', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'one', 'will', 'do', 'Why', 'very', 'simple', 'reason', 'Evan', 'did', 'NOT', 'do', 'time-traveling', 'whatsoever', 'own', 'twisted', 'mind', 'being', 'patient', 'Psychiatric', 'Facility', 'key', 'movie', 'Psychiatrist', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'revelation', 'Evan', 'are', 'NO', 'notebooks', 'used', 'imagination', 'order', 'create', 'Alternate', 'Universes', 'Why', 'So', 'escape', 'guilt', 'having', 'been', 'instrument', 'killing', 'neighbor', 'young', 'daughter', 'whom', 'had', 'puppy-love', 'crush', 'l', 'repeat', 'were', 'NO', 'notebooks', 'Thus', 'time', 'travel', 'twisted', 'mind', 'Evan', 'certified', 'crackpot', 'folks.As', 'endings', '6', 'one', 'dozen', 'other', 'Director', 'Cut', 'killing', 'Alternate', 'Universe', 'birth', 'be', 'assumed', 'fully', 'withdrawing', 'rest', 'life', 'Sanitarium', 'Theatrical', 'Release', 'youngster', 'fully', 'young', 'girl', 'family', 'everyone', 'lead', 'own', 'lives', 'dynamite', 'beatings', 'killings', 'prostitution', 'etc', 'way', 'nothing', 'happens', 'Evan', '3', 'friends']",N/A

Determined to get those memories back,  Evan  figures out a way to travel back in time to revisit those memories.  However, what he uncovers is so disturbing that he now wants to change those events so the future can  turn out better for  both him and his friends.But  no matter how hard he tries, changing the past doesn't create the happy ending  Evan  is hoping for, which frustrates him.  When he tries to save one person, another person ends up getting mentally and/or physically crippled ... and some even get killed.  Soon,  Evan  becomes obsessed with trying to get the past right and starts losing his mind in the process.It's only when he stops trying to control everything that he eventually sets everyone free....but it's also tragic in what he has to do to make that happen.I'm used to seeing  Ashton Kutcher  play dopey roles in ""That 70's Show"" and ""Dude, Where's my Car?"", so I didn't know if  Kutcher  could pull off a serious role.  He did surprisingly well.  The supporting characters are also convincing in their roles, too.  Evan's childhood male friend  is especially chilling in the bedroom scene where we see how  Evan's  actions changed his future.Just a word of warning, when it's revealed what really happened in  Evan's  childhood, it's pretty disturbing what's revealed.  You don't actually see what happens in graphic detail (thank goodness), but it is implied so your imagination fills in the blanks.Overall, I thought this was a compelling story.  The beginning starts out mysteriously as you see a little boy go into these fugue states and you don't know why, but are curious to know why.  It's also compelling to see if  Evan  can ever right what went wrong in his past.",4,When saving one life destroys another,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,1924,"['Evan', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'blocked', 'out', 'specific', 'events', 'memory', 'events', 'not', 'only', 'traumatized', 'Evan', 'also', 'traumatized', 'two', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'brother', 'one', 'friends', 'Determined', 'get', 'memories', 'back', 'Evan', 'out', 'way', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'revisit', 'memories', 'However', 'what', 'so', 'disturbing', 'now', 'change', 'events', 'so', 'future', 'can', 'turn', 'out', 'better', 'friends.But', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'changing', 'past', ""n't"", 'create', 'happy', 'ending', 'Evan', 'hoping', 'When', 'save', 'one', 'person', 'person', 'up', 'getting', 'mentally', 'and/or', 'physically', 'crippled', 'even', 'get', 'killed', 'Soon', 'Evan', 'obsessed', 'trying', 'get', 'past', 'right', 'losing', 'mind', 'process.It', 'only', 'when', 'trying', 'control', 'everything', 'eventually', 'everyone', 'free', 'also', 'tragic', 'what', 'do', 'make', 'happen.I', ""'m"", 'used', 'seeing', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'play', 'dopey', 'roles', '70', 'Show', 'Dude', 'Where', 'Car', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Kutcher', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'serious', 'role', 'did', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'convincing', 'roles', 'too', 'Evan', 'childhood', 'male', 'friend', 'especially', 'chilling', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'how', 'Evan', 'actions', 'changed', 'future.Just', 'word', 'warning', 'when', 'revealed', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Evan', 'childhood', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'what', 'revealed', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'what', 'graphic', 'detail', 'thank', 'goodness', 'implied', 'so', 'imagination', 'fills', 'blanks.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'compelling', 'story', 'beginning', 'out', 'mysteriously', 'see', 'little', 'boy', 'go', 'fugue', 'states', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'are', 'curious', 'know', 'why', 'also', 'compelling', 'see', 'Evan', 'can', 'ever', 'right', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'past']",N/A

As he does so, he finds he has more and more to unravel as the consequences of his meddling affect those around him.  Amy Smart is fabulous as Kutcher's girlfriend--and the one who pays the heaviest price for what he does.I found this movie to be extremely engaging.  Who wouldn't want to be able to change their past?  The plot blows along at a fast pace, and I was on the edge of my seat for most of it.  All of the supporting characters are well-played.  So few movies of this type are anything but action movies set in space/the future/the past.The DVD video transfer is excellent, but the available DTS 6.1 audio is superb!  In fact, this is one DVD to test your sound system.  Turn it up, and be prepared to jump off your couch!  This is an Infinifilm DVD, which means that you can access the special features while the movie is playing if you desire.  I don't like this feature, but you can also access them the good old-fashioned way as an extras menu.  Some of the extras on the DVD are pure horsepucky--there are pieces on chaos theory and time travel that have nothing to do with this movie.  In fact, chaos theory really has nothing to do with this movie, either, since the movie is not about small changes producing wide effect, but rather about major changes producing other focussed changes in lock-step.  I have to be vague to avoid giving away too much, but you'll see what I mean.  There is a feature that has the director/writers talking about the genesis of the film, and other things.  Although the plot is very creative, you'd think listening to this interview that nothing like this has been done before.  There is at least one Ray Bradbury story, and Ursula K LeGuin's book ""The Lathe of Heaven"" (which spawned two movies that I know of, neither quite worthy of the material) that do tread the same path.Both the theatrical version and the director's cut are included on the disc.  What the difference is, other than 7 minutes of additional length in the director's cut, I couldn't tell you--I only watched the director's cut.

It was available as a Canadian import as far back as 2009 but now it comes directly from the U.S. This new Blu-ray version comes with both the Director's Cut and the theatrical version. It also has an impressive amount of special features included.Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) suffered from blackouts and memory loss most of his childhood. He keeps a diary of the events so he can read them later and remember what he did. After heading off to college, he begins to have the blackouts again. Evan soon realizes he has the ability to alter reality through time-travel.Directors / writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber created quite a thought-provoking and suspenseful movie here. It makes you think about your actions in life and the sort of repercussions they have on those around us. It's a disturbing reminder that the things we say and do really affect people.This was Ashton Kutcher's first real dramatic leading role and he handled it well. It can be hard to push the image of an actor's character out of your mind if it gets stuck in there. I think Kutcher's biggest obstacle was getting audiences to see him as anyone but Michael Kelso from ""That 70s Show"" at the time. He succeeded in my opinion.The high definition transfer of the film looks and sounds great. The picture is clean and clear. All the color levels are well preserved. The 6.1 surround sound disperses the dialogue, audio effects, background noises, and musical score successfully throughout a home theater.Bonus material in this version include four featurettes entitled ""The Science and Psychology of the Chaos Theory,"" ""The History and Allure of Time Travel,"" ""The Creative Process,"" and ""Visual Effects."" There's commentary for the director's cut by co-directors and co-writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber. Deleted / alternate scenes and a storyboard gallery are included as well.If you're a fan of this particular movie or ones like it, getting ""The Butterfly Effect: The Director's Cut"" Blu-ray is a given. There's no better way to see it than in high-definition.

If you ask me this is one good directorial debut for these guys.It all starts when this little boy starts having this so-called blackouts. After the confusing lapse in time, we are brought back to a pivital event that changes his life. We, in the audience know exactly what happens after each blackout, which sometimes are very disturbing given the innuendo that comes with it. But, after getting over his blackouts and documenting his condition, he finds that he is able to rewind back in time and change the life-altering events. But even good deciscions make the worst outcomes. Throughout the movie he is forced to go back each time to change the chain of events which he set in motion. Not only is this a movie with heart, consequences and redemption but it is just a really good change of pace. It does something different. It does something original.

Yet by keeping a journal from the age of seven on, he is able to revert back to the past when he reads the journal as an adult, giving him the opportunity to make changes. However, the changes he makes (dog story excepted) create dire consequences as well. Overall, the events are just a wee (as in weeeeeeeeee...) bit melodramatic. Had he just tweaked a few details of moments BEFORE they became major events, he might have smoothed things out. But the story as is just has WAY too much ego, when you think about it.

Could he manage to pull of such a dramatic role, profoundly different from his normally comedic role on ""That 70's Show?""  The answer...yes, without question!The plot of this movie centers around the subject of time travel and what altering the past can do to the future.  However, unlike many other films that deal with the same topic, this keeps an aura of dark reality about it.  Not only does it deal with changing future events, it also delves into a deeper meaning than that.Aside from the obvious premise, this film also shows that your life is your life and you are dealt the cards you are dealt.  There is no need to change past events because no matter what you change, there will always be elements of your life you will not be happy with.  Also, not to give anything away but unlike many Hollywood movies, this one doesn't necessarily have a happy ending which in my mind is a good thing and perfectly justifies the movie as a whole.I must say I also felt a lot of good chemistry between Kutcher and Amy Smart.  To me, Ashton has proven himself a worthy actor in not only the comedic genre, but also the dramatic roles.  Amy Smart seems very natural in this role and doesn't seem to force anything.Overall this movie is well worth owning and truly shows the potential Ashton has in becoming a serious actor.

818127,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0001Z52RU,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT is an oddly controversial film.  Marketed as a star turn for Ashton Kutcher, it is more a film that, despite its big budget and excessive special effects, should have played the small art theaters.  Well, now, in the solitude of the home, the film can be watched for what it really is - an interesting concept based on the Chaos Theory: one tiny event can have cosmic end effects. The title references this theory: the flutter of a butterfly wing can result in a chain of events that may end in a huge, destructive windstorm.  The writers and directors of this film use a rather sophisticated example of a young man haunted by past events he recorded in journals only to find he is able to 'relive' those series of bad events, change one thing, and alter the outcome of the initial deed.  It just happens that his blackouts/memory lapses/time travels don't always make things better and it is only a final act of change/contrition that he is able to put the bad histories to rest. Yes, it is a bit sci-fi in technique, but it also elicits participation from the viewer who must concentrate to walk the maze created by the victim/perpetrator/madman/savior. The cast is well chosen and Kutcher for the most part is able to overcome his history of pretty boy, inane previous roles to make Evan (the history-altering proponent of the Chaos Theory) credible - and that says a lot.  The others in the cast do well with some occasional rather dreary dreadful roles inherent in the story, and while one wishes the cinematography/special effects could have been more sophisticated, the mood of the film remains unbroken until the rather surprising ending (Director's Cut version).  In other words, what on the surface may seem a glitzy, silly movie is actually a thinking person's film.

I didn't even want to watch it at first but I got talked into it, the next day I went out and bought a copy and watched it again.  It starts off at the end with him saying ""if only I could go back I might be able to save her"" then flashes back in time.  As a kid Evan (Ashton) has blackouts where he doesn't remember what happens but usually it's something bad.  He gets molested by Tommy & Kayley's dad (as does kayley) but blacks it out.  After going to a Psych Ward you find out his dad had the same blackout problems and many others (as did his grandfather).  The doctor tells his mom to monitor him by making Evan write everything in a journal and lets him see his dad (who lives in a mental hosital) but his dad tries to kill Evan and ends up getting killed.  It then flashes to age 13 Evan w/ his 3 friends Lenny (a fat kid), Kayley (not to sure on the spelling), and her brother Tommy (who is one sick f**k).  They get in some trouble w/ a stick of TNT (don't know what happens until much later) and Evan blacks it out and Lenny goes nuts and has to go to a Psych Ward as a patient.  Then they go to the movies and Tommy sees Evan kiss his sister and flips out only to later tie Evan's dog in a bag and light it on fire.  Evan's mom then says they're moving and it flashes to age 20 w/ Evan in college.  He goes out to drink w/ his roommate because he hasn't had a blackout in 7 yrs.  After taking a girl back to his place he reads one of his old journals and blacks out.  he then realizes he can read his old journals to go back in time to change the past, and he starts to do this.  This is where the movie gets real good and interesting (can he go back and save ""her"" (Kayley) or does he cause her to die, or is it Tommy, or is it Lenny, or is it a completely different Evan, or was it all in his mind since he inherited the disease of his dad and grandfather ????) but I won't go any further you'll have to watch it to see for yourself (and hopefully you'll understand at the end but I didn't until about the 4th or 5th time I watched it), but it is a GREAT movie and you have to see it!!!!!",5,Great movie,1100044800,"11 10, 2004",2004,2208,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'stating', 'am', 'NOT', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'fan', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'GREAT', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'watch', 'first', 'got', 'talked', 'next', 'day', 'went', 'out', 'bought', 'copy', 'watched', 'again', 'off', 'end', 'saying', 'only', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'then', 'back', 'time', 'kid', 'Evan', 'Ashton', 'blackouts', 'where', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'usually', 'something', 'bad', 'molested', 'Tommy', 'Kayley', 'dad', 'kayley', 'out', 'going', 'Psych', 'Ward', 'find', 'out', 'dad', 'had', 'same', 'blackout', 'problems', 'many', 'others', 'did', 'grandfather', 'doctor', 'mom', 'monitor', 'making', 'Evan', 'write', 'everything', 'journal', 'see', 'dad', 'who', 'mental', 'hosital', 'dad', 'tries', 'kill', 'Evan', 'up', 'getting', 'killed', 'then', 'age', '13', 'Evan', 'w/', '3', 'friends', 'Lenny', 'fat', 'kid', 'Kayley', 'not', 'sure', 'spelling', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'who', 'one', 'sick', 'f**k', 'get', 'trouble', 'w/', 'stick', 'TNT', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'much', 'later', 'Evan', 'blacks', 'out', 'Lenny', 'nuts', 'go', 'Psych', 'Ward', 'patient', 'Then', 'go', 'movies', 'Tommy', 'Evan', 'kiss', 'sister', 'out', 'only', 'later', 'tie', 'Evan', 'dog', 'bag', 'light', 'fire', 'Evan', 'mom', 'then', ""'re"", 'moving', 'age', '20', 'w/', 'Evan', 'college', 'out', 'drink', 'w/', 'roommate', ""n't"", 'had', 'blackout', '7', 'yrs', 'taking', 'girl', 'back', 'place', 'one', 'old', 'journals', 'blacks', 'out', 'then', 'can', 'read', 'old', 'journals', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'change', 'past', 'do', 'where', 'movie', 'real', 'good', 'interesting', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'save', 'Kayley', 'cause', 'die', 'Tommy', 'Lenny', 'completely', 'different', 'Evan', 'was', 'mind', 'inherited', 'disease', 'dad', 'grandfather', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", '4th', '5th', 'time', 'watched', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'have', 'see']",N/A

Then there is another category: Laughably Bad Movie Masquerading as Important Cinema. ""The Butterfly Effect"" is the last category.  It starts off with a pompous quotation on Chaos Theory, just so we know that there will be physicists, psychologists and other 'experts' pontificating on Chaos Theory & the Importance of this Movie  later on in the bonus material.I'd have to sum it up as 'Stand By Me Meets It's a Wonderful Life on Elm Street"".  Holes abound in the movie's own internal logic, and the biggest one of all is the basic premise:  If Evan, the main character, blacks out at crucial moments, how is keeping a journal going to help him reconstruct his memory, since he is only able to record in his notebook what he's able to remember up to the traumatic event, which, of course, he's totally blacked out?  His character's memory sure receives a lot of assistance from half-written & scribbled out pages.  Even if you're able to accept the basic premise, which is a real stretch, this Chaos Theory, which states that a butterfly flapping its wings can start a hurricane over on the other side of the world. The scope of Evan's chaos is pathetically small--him and his three friends & their unfortunate parents.  The major difference in Evan's alternative realities seems to be that sometimes he's a successful, popular college student in a fraternity & sometimes he's a moody loner with an obese Goth roommate.  I can't help thinking that if Chaos Theory is real, its ramifications might be a bit . . .larger than what happens to a few self-involved college kids.  The special effects that signal Evan's transition between worlds are laughable--it looks like someone was shooting on a Super8 camera and just shakes it really hard at intermittent intervals.I confess that I rented this movie to see what Ashton Kutcher has that is compelling enough to attract Demi Moore, and I confess that I am mostly unable to see it.  Ashton's cute enough, especially clean-shaven, and I certainly hope for his sake that he never winds up in prison for real, like he did in one of these scenarios in the movie.  Sometimes he appears to be wearing lipstick.  Either that, or he's got the naturally reddest lips I've ever seen on a girl, never mind a boy.  But can the boy ACT?  Um.  Roger Ebert put it diplomatically in his review when he said that Mr. Kutcher 'does what is required of him' by the script.  What, like . .breathe while walking at the same time and recite lines?  Yes, he can do that.The four protaganists are played by three sets of actors at various ages . . .7, 14 & 21.  The young actors playing the teens act circles around their older counterparts & they do some good work depicting adolescence in hell.  I've always had a soft spot for Eric Stolz, and it pains me to see him here, criminally wasted in a tiny role as Evan's friends' pedophilic father.  Dude, if you're gonna play a pedophile, at least make it a meaty role in a quality film.  Go see 'The Woodsman' for pointers.If you do buy this DVD (which I don't recommend), be sure to watch the Director's Cut first.  An early scene in the movie only makes any kind of 'sense' (notice the quotations) in light of that ending.

Reviewers' descriptors include: romantic, entertaining, mystery, sleaze, violent, thriller, dark, psychological, horror, sinister, time travel, evil, scientific, disturbing, etc.  These come from both favorable and unfavorable reviews.To understand Butterfly, one has to understand what the ""butterfly effect"" is; otherwise the viewer will be sorely disappointed.  The official editorial reviewer, Shannon, points to ""Jurassic Park"" for edification, but that's nonsense; don't waste your time there.Without going into detail, the butterfly effect is a very real scientific postulation that includes elements of chaos theory, non-linear differential equations, and how infinitesimal differences in initial conditions can drastically change outcomes.  Specifically, the butterfly effect refers to how the action of a butterfly in one part of the world might have unexpected but profound effects on weather systems half way around the globe.  Sounds absurd (like many found the movie), but it is an accepted theory in the scientific community.  I recommend ""Chaos"" by Gleick for a clear and understandable explanation of the effect, and for a general understanding of chaos theory.If I had no understanding of the butterfly effect, I would have panned the movie too.

Using the journals he kept as a child brings the moment back to play, more realistic than a dream.Plot : Please note first and foremost, this movie was billed as a Horror/Drama but it falls into the Sci-fi/Drama category to me. I classify anything dealing with some form of time travel to be considered science fiction. Now, on with the show......This was an amazing movie filled with all forms of emotions; sincerity, disgust, betrayal, hopefulness and the neverending question - should one person play ""god"" over everyone else's lives?Cast/Characters : I know what you are thinking, oh my, Jekyll actually sat through an Ashton Kutcher movie. Trust me, I amaze even myself. But in all honesty, he does a fantastic job in a dramatic role. You don't even realize who the actor is you are swept up in the moment. Powerful performance also by Amy Smart as we get to see her in different stages and ""lives"" - how she can be beautiful and glamourous in one scene and a totally wasted out drug addict in the next.Pace : The beginning of the movie was a bit slow, but did well in building up the story of each character and allowing us to get into their heads for a moment. Once the main character was grown and in college, the rest of the movie went pretty fast, jumping from ""life"" to ""life"" smoothly. Overall smooth sailing to the end of the movie.F/X : Not really a special effects type of movie, other than the sequences of Evan going from present time to past time. I WAS impressed with the use of sound and colors though in the movie. Depending on which person he would meet up with would determine the colors used to surround that person, wether they were happy or sad. In one scene we have a very happy, well adjusted girl surrounded by pinks and yellows and a very sunshine-sort-of-day and then within the same scene a very depressed, hurt and angry boy with just minimal colors of grey, white and black surrounding him. Truly an amazing sequence to me.Jekyll's Final Thoughts : This was definitely a surprize movie for me. Low expectations for me entering the film in having to sit through 2 hours of Ashton turned out to be 2 hours of an emotional roller coaster of a movie. I plan to watch this one again just to grasp on some moments that left me wondering. This is a must see movie - 5 stars!

There can be some corny moments and there are some brilliant momentss, the ride is uneven, but ultimately the good outshines the bad, the Butterfly Effect is very original and engaging throughout.So Ashton Kutcher has something his father did where they can alter their past by going over their records or whatever, and after having an initially f***ed up childhood he goes back to try to fix it to be with the girl he loves. The results vary wildly, sometimes he'll end up with her, while someone else's life is ruined, or his life is ruined, and nothing seems to come out perfect. The four major people are Ashton, his neighbors Kayleigh, the girl, Tommy, the psychopath, and Lenny, the token fat friend. What I liked about this film was that in each scenario they were all radically different characters playing the same people, basically the same set-up for the story gets completely altered but the recipe is still the same.You could say that the sci-fi elements are pretty half assed in the film, but it wasn't dumb enough to pull me out of the movie, if anything it was done well enough to work in the realm of the movie. So time travel nit-pickers might hate this film, but anyone else who can get sucked into a compelling story probably won't mind.Maybe my favorite thing about this film though is the ending, how after numerous trial and error attempts at making things better for him and the girl, he ultimately realizes that the only way for her to truly be happy is to never be involved with his life.

Giving us far too much information in a few seconds and turning me completely off it. I only saw it at the cinema because there was nothing else on and I'm glad I gave it a tiny chance.The concept is intriguing and the execution is brilliantly done. Set at three different stages in the lives of the four main characters we are quickly familiar with the sometimes curious, sometimes devastating events that shape their lives. The relationships between Evan, Kalley, Lenny and Tommy are very well developed and it's very interesting to watch them twist and change as Evan suffers from constant black-outs, Tommy goes totally insane and Kalley and Lenny even insaner. Almost all of them end up in the nut-house at some point.It's at this point that the older Evan (a horrifically bearded, pre-packaged and homogenised 'pretty boy' Ashton Kutcher) decides to time travel back to his childhood, thanks to his incredible memory (how this is achieved is never explained!!!) and put right what once went wrong. Only each time he tries he just makes things worse and worse.The storylines involving the younger quartet are truly the best bits of the film. The young Tommy is one of the most evil and depraved characters I have ever seen and the younger Evan is far more interesting than his future counterpart. Whenever the film flashes forward to the college years I found it extremely lagging and wished for another time travel scene. Ashton Kutcher was far less expressive than his younger actors.And am I the only one noticing several nods to Se7en? Not only do they go see the movie as kids (how they got in is never explained either but I'm assuming they got tickets for Dumb and Dumber and sneaked in) but Evan's journals (his method of time travel!) are exactly the same as John Doe's and are written in the same manner. A curious bit of trivia indeed.For a film with a great story, a few scares and wonderfully (if not nicely) developed characters then seriously check this out.

Then when we saw him with his girlfriend, well that was the top of the cake.  More publicity.  The only way Kutcher got knocked out of the news was when it was announced (Pardon me for saying this.  This is quite a shock) Chris Rock was going to host the 77th Academy Awards.After recovering from that, I put off seeing this film and waited months before I finally decided it was time to see it on DVD.  ""Additional Scenes"" and both versions theatrical and ""Director's Cut"" on one disc peaked my interest.Evan (Logan Lerman) has had some real horrifing things happen in his young life so far.  He visits his real father who is in a psycho ward.  The visit starts normal, but suddenly when he opens his eyes, he sees his father trying to ring his neck in full anger.The neighbor kids are with Evan (John Patrick Amedori).  They want to blow up a mailbox with an explosive.  They wait for the explosion.  When Evan comes to, he someone is in the woods.  Evan has blackouts.  He doesn't know what has just happened. he keeps a diary of his blackouts.  Nobody will tell him what has happened while he is out, so he still doesn't know.  It bothers him.  A solution to the problem, him and his parents move away.Now in college, Evan (Ashton Kutcher) hasn't had a blackout in seven years.  A date finds his diary and he begins to read it.  Suddenly the horrible memories come back to him.  He now knows how he blacked-out and the lost memories are now returning much to his horror.  He goes back to his old hometown to get answers with some horrifing effects.This DVD version gives you the chance to see the ""theatrical version"" or the ""Director's Cut"" version with a different ending.""Infinifilm"" can be chosen to play during either versions while you watch the film,  deleted scenes, casting, storyboards and alternate scenes.The theatrical version and ending is better.

Then he is a teen with similar issues, and then he appears as a college student (where Kutcher becomes the character).  At this point, he starts going through his old journals and his mind goes back to traumatic childhood episodes, where he discovers that he can change what happened by mentally altering his actions during the episode recall.  When he returns from these mental flashbacks, reality has changed according to what he did in the flashback.  Unfortunately, each time he tries to change things for the better, another painful reality unfolds.

Blascyk ""the Shamrock kid""","[1, 3]","Taking on a the plot gimmick of changing the past much like Bedazzled, Back to the future, or the TV show Quantum Leap. This isn't new territory, but this movie takes a fresh approach to the theme of changing the past and how it never works.Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), who suffered severe traumas as a boy copes with the pain by blacking out at moments of high stress. While searching for an answer to heal his emotional wounds, he finds that when he reads from his adolescent journals and focuses on those moments, he travels back in time, and is able to essentially fix parts of his past. There are consequences to his every choices.  His alternate futures vary from frat boy to prisoner to amputee. As he continues to do this, His intentions are in the right place, the actions he takes always have unintended consequences. You know what coming from there, the butterfly effect becomes the snowball effect.The story takes many leaps of faith and if you can get past the idea of being about to go back in time just by thinking about it you can enjoy it on some level.  Ashton Kutcher does a decent job, noting that blows you away but he does what's necessary to move the story along.  The supporting cast does about the same, just enough.  The concept has some value and the situations are interesting and somewhat predictable.  But when dealing with a movie like this where everything gets worse then gets tied up by the happy theatrical ending seems to not fit with what this film should have been. I know there is another ending but this review focuses on the original,(The Director's cut of the movie adds some amount of depth to the storyline, but differs only a little from the theatrical version of the film, as well as providing a bit more detailed look at Evan's ability) The directors cut ending is more fitting but still is a bit of a stretch, it works well to tie up some lose ends and try's to paint a certain picture about the character but still seems kinda funky to me.  I liked many things about this movie but disliked about as much.  The movie gets very repetitive and slightly predictable. The scenes with the children were a stretch and a bit to over the top for my tastes in this film.  The level of intensity never really hit it's peak that was needed.  this is a film that i can see where they were going with it and wasn't that far off, but in the end just fell short of a home run.  I think with a better director and maybe a more seasoned dramatic actor this film could have reached for something more than the popcorn movie that it is. This movie is based to much in the ""real world"" to really sell most of these over the top ideas and situations, if it was done more in the vein of lets say a 12 Monkeys where the reality is slightly surreal and blurred as well as the theme of psychosis that the main character isn't really experiencing what he thinks he is.  This is just my opinion of course but never really felt in the movie.  It's worth a watch and if you can get into the movies ideas you'll enjoy it on some level.I will mention that I'm a big Sci Fi fan and this movie was nominated for the prestigious Saturn award for best Sci Fi film in 2004 It lost to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and should have.",3,Dark thriller that just misses the mark,1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,3254,"['Taking', 'plot', 'gimmick', 'changing', 'past', 'much', 'Bedazzled', 'Back', 'future', 'TV', 'show', 'Quantum', 'Leap', ""n't"", 'new', 'territory', 'movie', 'fresh', 'approach', 'theme', 'changing', 'past', 'how', 'never', 'works.Evan', 'Treborn', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'who', 'suffered', 'severe', 'traumas', 'boy', 'pain', 'blacking', 'out', 'moments', 'high', 'stress', 'searching', 'answer', 'heal', 'emotional', 'wounds', 'when', 'adolescent', 'journals', 'focuses', 'moments', 'back', 'time', 'able', 'essentially', 'fix', 'parts', 'past', 'are', 'consequences', 'choices', 'alternate', 'futures', 'vary', 'frat', 'boy', 'prisoner', 'amputee', 'do', 'intentions', 'are', 'right', 'place', 'actions', 'always', 'have', 'unintended', 'consequences', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'there', 'butterfly', 'effect', 'snowball', 'story', 'many', 'leaps', 'faith', 'can', 'get', 'idea', 'being', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'just', 'thinking', 'can', 'enjoy', 'level', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'decent', 'job', 'noting', 'away', 'what', 'necessary', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'supporting', 'cast', 'same', 'just', 'enough', 'concept', 'value', 'situations', 'are', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'when', 'dealing', 'movie', 'where', 'everything', 'worse', 'then', 'tied', 'up', 'happy', 'theatrical', 'ending', 'not', 'fit', 'what', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'know', 'ending', 'review', 'original', 'Director', 'cut', 'movie', 'amount', 'depth', 'storyline', 'only', 'little', 'theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'providing', 'bit', 'more', 'detailed', 'look', 'Evan', 'ability', 'directors', 'cut', 'ending', 'more', 'fitting', 'still', 'bit', 'stretch', 'well', 'tie', 'up', 'lose', 'ends', 'try', 'paint', 'certain', 'picture', 'character', 'still', 'kinda', 'funky', 'liked', 'many', 'things', 'movie', 'disliked', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'very', 'repetitive', 'slightly', 'predictable', 'scenes', 'children', 'were', 'stretch', 'bit', 'top', 'tastes', 'film', 'level', 'intensity', 'never', 'really', 'hit', 'peak', 'was', 'needed', 'film', 'i', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'were', 'going', 'was', ""n't"", 'far', 'end', 'just', 'fell', 'short', 'home', 'run', 'think', 'better', 'director', 'maybe', 'more', 'seasoned', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'reached', 'something', 'more', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'movie', 'based', 'much', 'real', 'world', 'really', 'sell', 'most', 'top', 'ideas', 'situations', 'was', 'done', 'more', 'vein', 'lets', 'say', '12', 'Monkeys', 'where', 'reality', 'slightly', 'surreal', 'blurred', 'as', 'well', 'theme', 'psychosis', 'main', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'experiencing', 'what', 'just', 'opinion', 'course', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'movie', 'watch', 'can', 'get', 'movies', 'ideas', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'level.I', 'will', 'mention', ""'m"", 'big', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'fan', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'prestigious', 'Saturn', 'award', 'best', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'film', '2004', 'lost', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'should', 'have']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[4, 4]","I thought the movie was great psychological thriller, involving a pretty typical storyline about alterations to the past causing the future to turn out in ""unexpected ways""... rarely ever the way the protagonist really wants it to be. This is one of those movies that will keep your full attention for the entire length. Ashton Kutcher, in his first serious role, plays surprisingly well in this movie. He shows us a side that I hope we'll see again. But for the kind of person he is, Kutcher does an excellent job portraying his character. Amy Smart, William Lee Scott, and Elden Henson all have done a great job on acting out on different levels of their characters with the same core in each variation.Who ever wrote this was a smart person. There needs to be more intelligent writers. It is a big responsibility to entertain our public. A movie such as this makes us think about ""what if"" affects us emotionally, yet changes our physical world, thus putting great responsibility on the writer. This writer did very well and I thank him. We could use more thought feed movies in our world today. Imagine no war and always peace. Would our Bush agree to war, and What would happen if we all could go back to September 11th. Too many people focus on personal gain. Would it not benefit us all in a personal way to have peace? One act of kindness can be felt around the world. One violent thought not acted upon can cause a positive movement, just like that of a butterfly. The tension builds up quickly and you're never quite given a chance to relax before the end. I like that in a movie...it keeps you on your toes.This movie is very well done and well structured. There are no low points in this movie - each scene has a point and ties directly into the main idea of the movie. The ending is great as it made me feel sad but happy of its outcome.

818154,A1IRC4VBTL6B6J,B0001Z52RU,"J HADFIELD ""James Hadfield""","[12, 35]","Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) is a gifted college student whose childhood was plagued by blackouts that occurred during the pivotal moments of his life. Revisiting his old journals, he finds that he is able to relive these moments, and sets out to right past wrongs. However, with each intervention, he ends up radically altering his - and his friends' - presents: the ""butterfly effect"" to which the film's title refers.It's an intriguing premise, but one that this flick seems infuriatingly incapable of living up to. Alarm bells start ringing right from the off: the opening quote, explaining the titular effect, is credited not to a writer but merely to ""chaos theory"". Sloppy stuff, and things don't get much better thereafter. Take the fact that, in spite of altering his past, Evan is still able to remember exactly what he's done, waking-up in an unfamiliar bed with a dopey ""how did I get here?"" expression with each flap of that darned butterfly's wings. Shouldn't he be as oblivious as everyone around him? Maybe it's unfair to expect academic rigor from your average filmmaker, but it would've been nice to see a little more thought applied here. It's a bit like Darren Aronofsky's ""Pi"", whose mathematical genius fluffed even basic equations - more effort, please, people...Such quibbles aside, the screenplay does offer a few treats, with the repercussions of Evan's interventions alternately screwing him and his circle of friends in all manner of increasingly sick ways. Having his friend Tommy pop up in one revision as a psychopath, then in another as a devout Christian, was inspired; props to Amy Smart, too, for making a convincing stab at her character Kayleigh's alternate versions - cute girlfriend, traumatized waitress, drug-addicted hooker... Would that the same could be said about Kutcher, really. Fair play to him for trying his hand at some more ""heavyweight"" material, but he barely gets out of first gear.The same is true of ""The Butterfly Effect""'s attempts to tackle serious issues - disability, child abuse, prostitution, animal rights... It's encouraging to see a major picture refusing to shy away from such controversial subjects, but it's hard to shirk off the nagging doubt that writers Gruber and Bress introduced them more for their shock value than to get any dialogue started. The sheer quantity of Weighty Issues vying for attention here means that nothing ever gets more than a few minutes in the spotlight. It's more a case of: ""kiddy-fiddling? Check. Let's see what else we can fit in...""All in all, ""The Butterfly Effect"" makes for a bit of a depressing experience, a whole that's much smaller than the sum of its parts.

After all it does star Ashton Kutcher. Ashton gives a surprising performance in this movie though, and I left after watching this movie with the feeling that it earned every bit of the $7 it costed to see it.Kutcher plays Evan, who ever since childhood has had blackouts for unknown reasons. Seeing a doctor for these blackouts, he starts to keep a journal of just about everything that goes on in his daily life. Evan comes to realize that through these journals he can change occurences from his childhood. Evan's decision to change something from the past always results in the consequence of somebody elses life being affected, usually in a way he never though would happen. It is a well though out movie, one that will keep you thinking about the changes that occur and what could have been done differently to avoid that situation. Critics didn't give this movie much of a chance but you should. I was entertained from start to finish, never with an ounce of boredom. I think the overall message here is that we cant really change anything for the better without changing something else for the worse. What's better for one person can have consequences on others around you. This is a non-stop movie that never lets up, and with great performances by Ashton Kutcher, Amy Smart and others I definately say see this movie.

Chiappelli ""jjcx""","[27, 31]","Before I go on to describe why I liked this movie, I should explain right away that this is mostly a rebuttal of what the critics say. I think that this movie has received an unfair amount of criticism and I want to rebut some of the main points people have brought up.Firstly, if you go into the movie expecting Kutcher to suck in his role, then he probably will as far as you are concerned. It is tough to accept him as a dramatic lead, I admit, but if you try to not let his past interfere with your judgement, then it will free you to focus on the movie itself (something that very few mainstream critics seem to have done seriously).Secondly, if you watch this with the wrong group of people, then its mood changes drastically. I saw it in a crowded theater full of people who either came in expecting a comedy or were just planning to trash it. What happened was that I really enjoyed the movie, but many others complained constantly. Because this opened up the floor for criticism, many others joined in--this is an effect you can see frequently in any event where there are a lot of people. If everybody's laughing, then you are tempted to laugh. So, I reccommend that you try to see this only with an audience that you know will take it seriously, because otherwise it will ruin your enjoyment of the film.""The Butterfly Effect"" is a lot like other major science-fiction movies from the past in that it tries out a lot of new things and worries only about the elements it was created to serve. A good comparison brings to my mind the movie ""Dark City,"" which received very little praise or attention during its initial release. Both movies expect you to care for the characters without spending a great deal of time building them up. Both movies are more focused on answering the question, ""What if?"" and then trying to create a world where strange possibilities can be discovered.The movie has been criticized for being overly violent and too melodramatic. Too violent? Not so. Melodramatic? Not really, although I'll grant you that one or two points are a bit heavy-handed. Extremely disturbing? Yes.The violent content within is not exploitative in anyway--what it does is provides extreme environments for the ""butterfly effect"" theme to work with. The concept of the film is based on how much would change if you fixed one mistake in the past. To make these changes more interesting, the filmmakers have come up with some extreme material. For example, early in the film two of the main characters are sexually abused as children. By changing this event, the characters lives become drastically different. If Kutcher's character had instead went back in time and changed an event such as, say, his first hair cut, then there would probably not be a huge change in his life. So, the movie wouldn't be very interesting, nor would it explore the ""What if"" question very well.In the end, this movie is about ideas and exploration. It is a great movie because it heavily explores the concept of time travel and its effects on the future. It is not a movie for everyone, but I have a feeling that many people who would like it are going to be scared away (probably by the presence of Kutcher, who does a respectable job).I found it very clever, exciting, and thoroughly enjoyable. The acting is great all around and it is the first true thinking-man's (or -woman's) film I've seen for several years. Ultimately, though, I think it will find its audience on DVD and video. I can only hope, because it's a gem from our era.",5,"Probably best watched alone, without biases.",1075680000,"02 2, 2004",2004,3529,"['go', 'describe', 'why', 'liked', 'movie', 'should', 'explain', 'right', 'away', 'mostly', 'rebuttal', 'what', 'critics', 'say', 'think', 'movie', 'received', 'unfair', 'amount', 'criticism', 'want', 'rebut', 'main', 'points', 'people', 'have', 'brought', 'up.Firstly', 'go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'Kutcher', 'suck', 'role', 'then', 'probably', 'will', 'as', 'far', 'are', 'concerned', 'tough', 'accept', 'dramatic', 'lead', 'admit', 'try', 'not', 'let', 'past', 'interfere', 'judgement', 'then', 'will', 'free', 'focus', 'movie', 'something', 'very', 'few', 'mainstream', 'critics', 'seem', 'have', 'done', 'seriously', '.Secondly', 'watch', 'wrong', 'group', 'people', 'then', 'mood', 'changes', 'drastically', 'saw', 'crowded', 'theater', 'full', 'people', 'who', 'came', 'expecting', 'comedy', 'were', 'just', 'planning', 'trash', 'What', 'happened', 'was', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'many', 'others', 'complained', 'constantly', 'opened', 'up', 'floor', 'criticism', 'many', 'others', 'joined', 'effect', 'can', 'see', 'frequently', 'event', 'where', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'everybody', 'laughing', 'then', 'are', 'tempted', 'laugh', 'So', 'reccommend', 'try', 'see', 'only', 'audience', 'know', 'will', 'take', 'seriously', 'otherwise', 'will', 'ruin', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'lot', 'other', 'major', 'science-fiction', 'movies', 'past', 'out', 'lot', 'new', 'things', 'worries', 'only', 'elements', 'was', 'created', 'serve', 'good', 'comparison', 'brings', 'mind', 'movie', 'Dark', 'City', 'received', 'very', 'little', 'praise', 'attention', 'initial', 'release', 'movies', 'expect', 'care', 'characters', 'spending', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'building', 'up', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'focused', 'answering', 'question', 'What', 'then', 'trying', 'create', 'world', 'where', 'strange', 'possibilities', 'can', 'be', 'discovered.The', 'movie', 'been', 'criticized', 'being', 'overly', 'violent', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'Too', 'violent', 'Not', 'so', 'Melodramatic', 'Not', 'really', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'one', 'two', 'points', 'are', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'Extremely', 'disturbing', 'Yes.The', 'violent', 'content', 'not', 'exploitative', 'anyway', 'what', 'extreme', 'environments', 'butterfly', 'effect', 'theme', 'work', 'concept', 'film', 'based', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'change', 'fixed', 'one', 'mistake', 'past', 'make', 'changes', 'more', 'interesting', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'extreme', 'material', 'example', 'early', 'film', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'sexually', 'abused', 'children', 'changing', 'event', 'characters', 'become', 'drastically', 'different', 'Kutcher', 'character', 'had', 'instead', 'went', 'back', 'time', 'changed', 'event', 'such', 'say', 'first', 'hair', 'cut', 'then', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'huge', 'change', 'life', 'So', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'would', 'explore', 'What', 'question', 'very', 'well.In', 'end', 'movie', 'ideas', 'exploration', 'great', 'movie', 'heavily', 'concept', 'time', 'travel', 'effects', 'future', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'have', 'feeling', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'scared', 'away', 'probably', 'presence', 'Kutcher', 'who', 'respectable', 'job', 'found', 'very', 'clever', 'exciting', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'acting', 'great', 'around', 'first', 'true', 'thinking-man', '-woman', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'years', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'audience', 'DVD', 'video', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'gem', 'era']",N/A

The only problem is, things keep getting worse instead of better as each alternate universe unfolds, until Kutcher finally perceives the big picture and uncovers the key that will truly affect a significant change in the lives of the people he loves.

818162,A33IATTAB2Q7KD,B0001Z52RU,John Bliss,"[1, 3]","I was intrigued by the trailers for this movie when it came out, but I never got around to seeing it. Part of the reason was the Kutcher factor (Can he carry it off?), but mostly I was distracted by more important things. When it came out on DVD, I was excited to see it. And the video store clerk told me it was GREAT.It wasn't great.First things first: Ashton Kutcher does a good job in the movie. In fact, all of the actors turn in good performances, especially considering that they are required to play the same character in alternate realities. Despite the changed circumstances, the characters remain consistent, and that's more difficult than it sounds. The young actors who play the main characters as children are very good, particularly Logan Lerman, who plays Evan (the Kutcher character) at age 7. Lerman is required to play a broader emotional range than Kutcher, especially when you consider that in his later scenes, he has to ""channel"" the adult Evan as well. Another bright spot, in a role that could have been phoned in, is Nathaniel DeVeaux, who plays Evan's doctor.My problem with the film is not in the acting, but in the writing. Although the ideas are interesting - and if you're reading this review, I assume you already know the basic plot of the movie - the execution is fairly flat. An earlier reviewer compared this movie to ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" and like that movie, the first half seems endless. The scenes setting up Evan's childhood traumas seem to go on forever - especially since we don't get to see what actually happened/happens until later in the film. There's a good reason for this, given the structure of the film, but it makes the first hour of the movie feel like homework.In the trailer, a voice over informs Evan, ""Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down."" In the film, unfortunately, that line occurs in a scene in which a younger Evan is hypnotized. When the adult Evan begins time-traveling, his trips are all pretty straight forward. And when he returns to the present, we get the gag pretty quickly, and nothing in the writing deepens those moments. The characters aren't human beings so much as pieces in a puzzle the writers/directors are building, so it's hard to care what happens.I did enjoy the twists of the plot. I won't go into details, for those who haven't seen the movie, but the cause of Evan's childhood blackouts, when eventually revealed, is enjoyable, and the ways the writers limit Evan's travel possibilities as time goes on adds to the suspense.

People probably thought the same way when Mel Gibson played ""Hamlet"" in the '80's.But Mel Gibson was great in ""Hamlet"", and Kutcher is actually pretty good in ""The Butterfly Effect"", as well.  He avoids for the most part Keanu-esque awkward moments that make the viewer cringe and pulls off a believable-enough performance as a college student whose realities just aren't what they used to be.The story follows his character for 13 years from childhood to college, during which times he is prone to blackouts that he can't explain that have great effect on the direction his life takes.  In his desire to determine their cause and to regain the memory he lost during their occurrance, he finds that he has the ability to literally revisit his childhood (as well as his adolescence), returning to the exact point in time when he lost consciousness before...only upon his return he maintains the consciousness and the knowledge he had as a young adult.Ultimately he decides that with the hindsight of an adult, he can, as a child, change the course of events that brought unhappiness to himself, his mother, and his friends.  This has the effect of changing any number of other things that happens consequently, and as a result the present that he realizes changes each time he ""wakes up"".""Donnie Darko"" comparisons are inevitable...the afflicted yet brilliant young man, the malicious company he keeps, the ""stitch in time"" plot in general...anyone who was a fan of one movie should definitely appreciate the other.  The ""director's cut"" edition is particularly satisfying if you're looking for an ending that is essentially the antithesis of the moral found in the Christmas classic ""It's A Wonderful Life"".It's a good movie.  The continuity obsessives will no doubt have a field day complaining about every little detail that the producer missed, but this is only a movie and the suspension of at least SOME disbelief should be accorded.  I don't think I'm totally sold on Ashton making his living in dramatic roles, but he was a lot better than I was initially willing to give him credit for, and it does show that he's a lot more versatile than the other teeny flicks he's made outside of ""That '70's Show"".",4,"It's ""Donnie Darko"" taken to another level.",1097625600,"10 13, 2004",2004,2386,"['was', 'very', 'apprehensive', 'seeing', 'movie', 'believing', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'beard', 'mean', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'market', 'something', 'not', 'People', 'probably', 'thought', 'same', 'way', 'when', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'played', 'Hamlet', ""'80's.But"", 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'was', 'great', 'Hamlet', 'Kutcher', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'Keanu-esque', 'awkward', 'moments', 'make', 'viewer', 'cringe', 'off', 'believable-enough', 'performance', 'college', 'student', 'realities', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'be.The', 'story', 'character', '13', 'years', 'childhood', 'college', 'times', 'prone', 'blackouts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'have', 'great', 'effect', 'direction', 'life', 'desire', 'determine', 'cause', 'regain', 'memory', 'lost', 'occurrance', 'ability', 'literally', 'revisit', 'childhood', 'as', 'well', 'adolescence', 'returning', 'exact', 'point', 'time', 'when', 'lost', 'consciousness', 'only', 'return', 'consciousness', 'knowledge', 'had', 'young', 'adult.Ultimately', 'hindsight', 'adult', 'can', 'child', 'change', 'course', 'events', 'brought', 'unhappiness', 'mother', 'friends', 'effect', 'changing', 'number', 'other', 'things', 'consequently', 'result', 'present', 'changes', 'time', 'up', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'comparisons', 'are', 'inevitable', 'afflicted', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'young', 'man', 'malicious', 'company', 'stitch', 'time', 'plot', 'general', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'fan', 'one', 'movie', 'should', 'definitely', 'appreciate', 'other', 'director', 'cut', 'edition', 'particularly', 'satisfying', ""'re"", 'looking', 'ending', 'essentially', 'antithesis', 'moral', 'found', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'Wonderful', 'Life', '.It', 'good', 'movie', 'continuity', 'obsessives', 'will', 'doubt', 'have', 'field', 'day', 'complaining', 'little', 'detail', 'producer', 'missed', 'only', 'movie', 'suspension', 'least', 'SOME', 'disbelief', 'should', 'be', 'accorded', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'totally', 'sold', 'Ashton', 'making', 'living', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'was', 'initially', 'willing', 'give', 'credit', 'show', 'lot', 'more', 'versatile', 'other', 'teeny', 'flicks', 'made', ""'70"", 'Show']",N/A

818167,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0001Z52RU,Jonathan Appleseed,"[2, 3]","I have two responses to this film: an emotional one, and an intellectual one.My emotional response is that all of the actors played their roles with such convincing strength, and that the quality of direction was at such a high level that it was relatively easy to suspend disbelief (necessary in a film such as this). Even though many of the situations ? specifically the taboo situations ? were tired clich?-ridden retreads, my emotional responses to them were powerful. (During the film, that is. As I rethink them, I?m disgusted at myself for having powerful reactions to such tired retreads that offered no new explorations.)The concept of the film ? an exploration into how our choices affect the outcome of our lives ? is, if not an original concept, always an interesting one. This film is, essentially, a macrocosmic exploration of that question.Intellectually, however, my reaction is slightly different. We learn the likely reason for Evan?s blackouts as a child later in the film, but the explanation isn?t explored beyond that single connection. I consider that a considerable flaw, because when you start to piece each blackout with the supposed event that caused it, they don?t all add up. Moreover, much has been made of the quality of the drawing that Evan made as a seven year old. When we approach the end of the film, we understand what the painting represents. We also see that it wasn?t really a seven year old Evan that was drawing that. However, that disrupts the films prescribed timelines and organization as if nuclear fusion were occurring at its core. How could Evan, at that particular point in the film, possibly know what the sum total of his choices was going to be? Also, his father AND his grandfather possessed the same abilities as Evan? That?s a bit hard to swallow.Still, it was an interesting film to watch. Better than I thought, but not as good as it could have been.",3,"Yes, it is guilty pleasure best watched at home.

As such it provides a good lesson to every filmmaker as well as every fan of cinema.I originally saw the theatrical release version and although I found it thought-provoking it seemed to dissolve in the end quite unsatisfyingly.Then I got the DVD Director's cut release. Having already seen it the way the studio wanted I watched the Director's cut. And I was completely floored. Not only did the admitedly minor changes (the addition of a few short scenes in the body of the film and an entirely different ending) completely alter the point of the film it elevated it from merely another creepy science fiction foray into the world of ""time travel"" and into the realm of, what I consider, art.My recommendation for those who have not seen this film would be:1. Watch the ""theatrical release"" version (it's on one side of the disk) first.2. Wait a little while, say a week.3. Watch the ""director's cut"" side. (Feel free to fast forward through sequences that look familiar)For me this was a rare case where something I thought I had seen and understood was totally changed because of finally seeing the director's vision (rather than what the studio hoped would make it successful.) I had an emotional reaction to the director's cut similar to that I experienced upon first seeing the ending of ""Sixth Sense""... despite the fact that I'd already seen the theatrical release version of this film. And isn't that what we go to movies for in the first place?One WARNING:This is not an easy film to ""enjoy"". It is about as far from a ""feel good"" experience as you can get. Indeed, it vaguely reminded me of helplessly watching a puppy being methodically beaten to death. It is brutal, disheartening, depressing and never seems to let up despite the best intentions of the main character. But then art isn't always necessarily ""pretty"". What it tells you is sometimes what you do not want to hear. That is definitely the case with this film.Perhaps that's why so many people absolutely hated this film. It's not easy to watch and can be quite disturbing. If you want something merely entertaining, look elsewhere.But if you found yourself one of the rare fans of ""Unbreakable"", because (rather than in spite) of the fact that it didn't live up to any pre-concieved expectations you might have had, then do see ""The Butterfly Effect"".I think in years to come the Director's cut will be more greatly appreciated for what it is... unique.",4,"Brutal, uncompromising art",1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,2549,"['one', 'films', 'was', 'essense', 'ruined', 'interests', 'studios', 'hopes', 'making', 'commercial', 'such', 'good', 'lesson', 'filmmaker', 'as', 'well', 'fan', 'cinema.I', 'originally', 'saw', 'theatrical', 'release', 'version', 'found', 'thought-provoking', 'seemed', 'dissolve', 'end', 'quite', 'unsatisfyingly.Then', 'got', 'DVD', 'Director', 'cut', 'release', 'Having', 'already', 'seen', 'way', 'studio', 'wanted', 'watched', 'Director', 'cut', 'was', 'completely', 'floored', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'admitedly', 'minor', 'changes', 'addition', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'body', 'film', 'entirely', 'different', 'ending', 'completely', 'alter', 'point', 'film', 'elevated', 'merely', 'creepy', 'science', 'fiction', 'foray', 'world', 'time', 'travel', 'realm', 'what', 'consider', 'art.My', 'recommendation', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'would', 'be:1', 'Watch', 'theatrical', 'release', 'version', 'one', 'side', 'disk', 'first.2', 'Wait', 'little', 'while', 'say', 'week.3', 'Watch', 'director', 'cut', 'side', 'Feel', 'free', 'fast', 'forward', 'sequences', 'look', 'familiar', 'was', 'rare', 'case', 'where', 'something', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'understood', 'was', 'totally', 'changed', 'finally', 'seeing', 'director', 'vision', 'rather', 'what', 'studio', 'hoped', 'would', 'make', 'successful', 'had', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'director', 'cut', 'similar', 'experienced', 'first', 'seeing', 'ending', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'fact', ""'d"", 'already', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'release', 'version', 'film', ""n't"", 'what', 'go', 'movies', 'first', 'place', 'One', 'WARNING', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'enjoy', 'far', 'feel', 'good', 'experience', 'can', 'get', 'Indeed', 'vaguely', 'reminded', 'helplessly', 'watching', 'puppy', 'being', 'methodically', 'beaten', 'death', 'brutal', 'disheartening', 'depressing', 'never', 'let', 'up', 'best', 'intentions', 'main', 'character', 'then', 'art', ""n't"", 'always', 'necessarily', 'pretty', 'What', 'sometimes', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'hear', 'definitely', 'case', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'film', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'want', 'something', 'merely', 'entertaining', 'look', 'elsewhere.But', 'found', 'one', 'rare', 'fans', 'Unbreakable', 'rather', 'spite', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'pre-concieved', 'expectations', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'then', 'do', 'see', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', '.I', 'think', 'years', 'come', 'Director', 'cut', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'greatly', 'appreciated', 'what', 'unique']",N/A

I also must add that DVD is so great to have, This movie had this thing called ""Alternative Endings"" so you could chose which ending that you liked most. If you had seen it on the cinema, the ending was quite dark and unhappy, so to say. But here you can chose between 4 diffrent one's that suits you best. The Unhappy ending contradicted the story a bit and it surely must have made some people dislike this movie just because of it.Ashton Kuther plays a guy called Evan that you get to follow from the days as a kid to his 20's. He got some terrible blackouts as a kid, just like his father and will end up not remembering what really happened. In order to remember he keeps a diary that he frequently writes in every day. His childhood wasn't the best and alot of terrible things happened that he either don't want to remember or can't because of his many blackouts. When he becomes older, he realize that he could go back in time and change things thanks to his diary's (and also video tapes later on) When Evan goes back in time, he changes small details that later comes to change how his whole life and his friends later became. No matter how he changes it, there will always be some things that turns out wrong, and as they say ""One thing Leads to another"" and when he comes back to reality there is a alternative world and certain things are totally diffrent from before, so he must go back again to make his world perfect.It's not the most easy movie to follow, it can be hard to understand at times and you need to stay focused and remember diffrent details. It's even worth seeing twice to understand some things better. It got some flows from time to time and it isn't perfect but it's a very unique and also a exciting movie that it defenitely well made. Kutcher shows some good acting and Amy Smart as his girlfriend aswell. Now thanks to the Dvd version you get directors cut that is a longer and deeper version and you get to decide the ending aswell.

818172,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B0001Z52RU,JRP,"[0, 0]","Hello out there those of you reading this review this is part of my series where I go back & review movies that either came out in 20 years ago or 10 years ago. This review is for the awesome movie The Butterfly Effect. Now I haven't seen since I rented on DVD so I have somewhat of a fresh perspective I watched both cuts I like the theatrical edition more there's only 1 scene I like in The Director's Cut which I will get to & I watched this movie on Blu Ray cause it was in the $ 7.88 bin at Wal Mart & going back 10 years so far this was the best movie from that year. I know I will go on & on so I am sorry about that this is a retrospective. The movie was made for $13 million & it made $17 million in it's opening weekend in it's entire run in The US it made $57 million & when all was said & done it made $96 million worldwide. The movie was directed by Eric Bress & J Mackye Gruber & watching the special features I understand why it had 2 director's. Both of them wrote for Final Destination 2 & 4. & have had other TV writing gigs. The movie stars Ashton Kutcher as Evan it revolves around him a these 3 other characters Kayleigh, Lenny & Tommy. Now you start off with this kid named Evan who has these blackouts which goes back to his Father who is locked up. This Teacher tells Evan's Mom about this drawing showing him killing 2 people & Evan doesn't remember drawing from there were introduced to Kayleigh & Tommy who he's going to spend the day with so he blacks out he's in a basement with Kayleigh & her Father is going to use them to make a disgusting disturbing movie & if you have seen this movie you know what I mean if not then go find The Butterfly Effect cause it's an amazing movie. Then it goes to a few years later where Evan, Kayleigh & Tommy are 13 & they have this other kid they hang out with Lenny. Tommy who is f  *  *  *  ed up in the head finds this dynamite he wants to blow something up so he has Lenny put it in this mail box but Evan has a black out & Lenny is like  catatonic  from it he's sent to a hospital. Now there is a scene in The Director's Cut where Evan finds papers about his Grandfather & that he had the same problems as him too. At The Theater the kids decide to see Seven & Tommy is being annoying through out it Evan & Kayleigh are talking in the lobby Evan finds out that her Father is abusing her Tommy is starting something he is tripped by this older boy he goes off & beats him up & Tommy is arrested. Awhile later you have Evan Kayleigh & Tommy are in the woods Kayleigh sees smoke Tommy has Evan's Dog in a bag & he is going to set him on fire he hits Evan Kayleigh with a wooden plank he blacks out when he wakes up he finds that his Dog has been burnt to death & Lenny is out of it. Then 7 years later Evan is in college where he has this goth roommate & they're going to celebrate cause Evan hasn't had any black outs in 7 years. Evan picks up this girl at a bar & she finds his Journal & he reads her some of it & he learns he can go back. He heads into town he finds out that Lenny is some kind of emotional mess he doesn't leave his room & builds model airplanes. You find out the day Evan's Dog was killed that Lenny was trying to free it from the bag Tommy threatened to kill Lenny's Mom. Bring that day up upsets Lenny he finds Kayleigh who is depressed & they talk he brings up the day her Dad was going to film them which sets her off & later Tommy calls Evan & tells him Kayleigh killed herself & he will kill him. There is 1 deleted scene in The Director's Version I liked where Evan's Mom takes him to this Fortune Teller & she tells Evan he wasn't meant to be & he has no soul which upsets his Mom you find out before she had Evan she miscarried 3 times I will admit they should've left that scene in The Theatrical Edition. When reading his Journal he goes back to the day when Kayleigh's Dad was going to film them but Evan tells him what will happen & tells him to treat his Daughter right & focus on Tommy who is evil & twisted. When awakes in his room he's with Kayleigh both of them are in College Kayleigh is in some kind of group & Evan is a Frat Boy. Anyway he put things right & is going to have a special dinner with Kayleigh that's cut short cause someone has busted up his car. Kayleigh tells him about her brother getting out of prison he is going to kill but Evan does his best fights back & kills him Evan is sent to prison where he has to put up with some torment his Mom brings his Journal's but these 2 gang members take his Journal's where in The Director's Cut they read them out loud. Evan has sort of became friends with this inmate who is a christian he shows him what is capable of so he helps Evan get his Journal's back Evan goes back to the day his Dog died he finds a piece & gives it Lenny so he came the bag & release his Dog. This time Evan talks Tommy out of killing The Dog he tells him he will stop seeing Kayleigh Lenny stabs Tommy in the back with the piece of metal This time he's back with The Goth Guy & every time he changes the future Evan suffers some kind of brain damage that causes nosebleeds which I thought was a good touch cause he's changing what he knows in his mind. When he is released from the hospital he finds Lenny there who is strapped down to a bed Lenny tells him you knew something was going to happen he told him that he should be here not him. He goes to find Kayleigh he finds out she is a drugged up Pros  t  it  u  t  e. Basically everytime he tries to fix something that happened in the past something goes wrong & he was told by his Dad you can't mess with people's pasts & change who they are cause he blacked out when he visited his Dad in the hospital & he attacked Evan & tried to kill him & he was killed by the staff. This time Evan goes to the day Tommy had Lenny put the dynamite in the mail box he blacked out that day what happened was a woman & her baby were killed in an explosion. So Tommy goes to stop the lady Evan tries to remove the explosive but it goes off he awakes in his Dorm Room to find out he lost his arms & legs he's now in a Wheelchair Lenny's with Kayleigh & Tommy is nice clean cut Christian Man. Evan tries to kill himself but is found by Tommy he takes him to see his Mother who is dying of Lung Cancer cause she started again after Evan's accident so he decides to go back after the dynamite he goes back to the day when Kayleigh's Dad was going to film them he finds the dynamite he tries to take it away from him he drops it to the ground where Kayleigh picks it up thinking it's a sparkler & it goes off & she is killed. Evan ended up being locked up he finds his Doctor he asks for his Journal's he tells him there is no Journal's just like his Dad though there was a Photo Album. Later on Evan locks himself up in The Doctor's Office writing a note that he has to save her not in The Director's Cut Evan goes to the day he was born cause he's watching home movies & he kills himself. In The Theatrical Ending he goes to back to the day he met Kayleigh he tells her he hates her & he never wants to see her again. Cause Kayleigh told him that he was the reason  she never went to go live with her Mom cause she cared about him. So that way she goes & lives her life & he can live his. So I do prefer The Theatrical Edition over The Director's Cut there's only 1 deleted scene in The Director's Cut I like. Anyway Evan's in College he's roommates with Lenny they burn The Journal's it goes to 8 years later Evan's in New York City he crosses paths with Kayleigh the movie ends with a really good song Stop Crying Your Heart Out by Oasis. What do I think overall I think this movie is smart along with a great plot a lead that's likable cause he wants to fix things & make them better to save the girl he loves even if it means doing something mean & hateful. The features are decent & you'll understand why it was co Directed by Eric Bress J Mackye Gruber who did a really good job directing.  Ahston Kutcher did a really good job the rest of the cast was good too. So I do recommend this movie I got my copy on Blu Ray out of a $7.88 bin at Wal Mart. I do know there is 2 other movies & I haven't ever seen them I might get them 1 of these days & see what I think of them. As for my next review in this series I'll see what I can do for February & I hope you enjoyed this review & retrospective.",5,2004 in film The Butterfly effect 9/10 review &

818173,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B0001Z52RU,Julian Kennedy,"[2, 3]","The Butterfly Effect: 4 out of 10: The first 40 minutes of The Butterfly Effect are tough sledding. It's not incompetent film-making mind you. If anything the film is simply too effective. Literally showing the world's worst childhood. It is so much of a downer with its child molestation, its baby killing and, most unforgivingly, its burning puppies; that it is almost a Stephen King parody rather than an actual science fiction drama.I guess there is a reason we repress memories after all. I would repress this childhood as well.The film to that point kind of reminded me of Sleepers in that it was so unpleasant to experience that it simply doesn't matter how good the movie really is. Then the movie takes a wild turn as Ashton Kutcher shows up as the adult version of our protagonist.. As easy a target as he is I hate to admit the second two-thirds of the film are really not his fault.Some notes to writer/directors Eric Briss and J. Mackye Gruber. If your going to have scenes in a prison you might want to visit one first, or at least watch a documentary on the same. Speaking of documentaries ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and other eighties comedies are not a documentaries on college life. Sororities do not resemble the Playboy Mansion. And twenty-three year old crack whores often look bad, but they tend not to resemble a Dawn of the Dead extra.If The Butterfly Effect didn't keep flashing back to the puppy and baby horrors, then the second two thirds would be a hoot. There is even a ""hey there is a psycho chasing me lets take a walk in the dark woods"" scene.To add injury to insult, since Kutcher's time travel effects only his friends and family and nothing else at all. The Butterfly Effect inadvertently substantiates the reverse of the Butterfly theorem.Needless to say the change in tone from the childhood scenes and adult scenes is jarring. Though most of the humor in the adult scenes is admittedly unintentional.Kutcher travels back in time by staring at notebook paper. I tried the same technique staring at my screen. It didn't work I still lost two hours.",2,The Butterfly Effect...

Far better than theater version that underestimated (hmm, maybe not after all) intelligence and spiritual depth of audience and gave in to a cop out shallower version.

It's so suspenseful, well written, disturbing, chilling, and violent that it just makes you love it. I had lots of mature themes in it, like a pedophile (played great by Eric Stoltz from ""Pulp Fiction""), a burning of a dog, stabbings, beatings to death, profanity, nudity and sex, prostitution, suicide, and the murder of a woman and her child. But now to the other stuff.Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) is a troubled young man who discovers he can travel back in time after reading his journals he wrote in as a kid. He tries to go back in time and prevent horrific events from ever happening, but it alters things in the future. When he returns, things range from bad to worse. His friends, his mother and himself aren't the same.I enjoyed the ending of this film, even though it was sort of bad. In the director's cut version, he goes back to when he was a fetus in his mother's womb, and he strangles himself with his umbilical cord so he never existed, and his closest friend Caley grows up without the trama's of their childhood ever happening and she gets happily married instead of commiting suicide. In the theatrical version, he goes back to when their about 5 or 6 and he tells her he hates her, so they aren't friends throughout their lives, and then they passby on the street, and they both recognize each other but continue walking. This one was more emotional, even though the other ending was happy, this one was sad and emotional and I liked it better. I especially enjoyed the music in this scene, ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" by Oasis, it added to the sadness of this scene.I enjoyed this film a lot and if you are a fan of suspense and aren't afraid of some violence and blood, you will enjoy this film.",5,A suspenseful and amazing movie,1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,1855,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'numerous', 'times', 'theatrical', 'director', 'cut', 'versions', 'film', 'one', 'favourite', 'movies', 'ever', 'so', 'suspenseful', 'well', 'written', 'disturbing', 'chilling', 'violent', 'just', 'love', 'had', 'lots', 'mature', 'themes', 'pedophile', 'played', 'great', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'burning', 'dog', 'stabbings', 'beatings', 'death', 'profanity', 'nudity', 'sex', 'prostitution', 'suicide', 'murder', 'woman', 'child', 'now', 'other', 'stuff.Evan', 'Treborn', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'reading', 'journals', 'wrote', 'kid', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'prevent', 'horrific', 'events', 'ever', 'happening', 'things', 'future', 'When', 'things', 'range', 'bad', 'worse', 'friends', 'mother', 'are', ""n't"", 'same.I', 'enjoyed', 'ending', 'film', 'even', 'was', 'sort', 'bad', 'director', 'cut', 'version', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'fetus', 'mother', 'womb', 'umbilical', 'cord', 'never', 'existed', 'closest', 'friend', 'Caley', 'up', 'trama', 'childhood', 'ever', 'happening', 'happily', 'married', 'instead', 'commiting', 'suicide', 'theatrical', 'version', 'back', 'when', '5', '6', 'are', ""n't"", 'friends', 'lives', 'then', 'passby', 'street', 'recognize', 'other', 'continue', 'walking', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'emotional', 'even', 'other', 'ending', 'was', 'happy', 'one', 'was', 'sad', 'emotional', 'liked', 'better', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'scene', 'Stop', 'Crying', 'Your', 'Heart', 'Out', 'Oasis', 'added', 'sadness', 'scene.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'lot', 'are', 'fan', 'suspense', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'violence', 'blood', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A

It was surprisingly good!Evan (played by Ashton Kutcher) had a rocky childhood where he had many blackout periods and where he couldn't remember what happened.  His father was in a mental institution for a similar problem (he had the blackouts as well).  He had some rough times with his friends, especially with siblings Tommy and Kaylie who had an abusive pedophile father.  The three of them, plus a friend named Lenny, tended to hang out together and get in trouble.  A couple particular events between the four of them end up scarring them all for life.Cut to the present, Evan is a psych major at a university, Kaylie is a disturbed waitress at a diner, Tommy got out of juvenile hall and works in an auto shop and Lenny is bordering on insanity and still living with his mother.  Evan confronts Kaylie and tries to find out what happened during a particular blackout where the two of them were in her father's basement making a movie, when he blacks out and wakes up without his clothes on.  She is mentally disturbed by this and the next day commits suicide.Evan is distraught over this and begins to read his journals that he's kept since he was a little kid.  He's reading about a particular event, then suddenly seems to be there reliving it.  He wakes up shaken with a bloody nose and a new scar.  He begins to realize that he can use his journals to go back to those blackout periods and can actually change what happened.  Once he changes one little thing, however, the butterfly effect takes over and EVERYTHING changes.  He keeps trying to change things to make everyone happy and things don't quite turn out like he hoped.I thought the acting was superb.  I've never been a huge fan of Ashton Kutcher, but he did a great job in this film.  The other lead characters were also great, especially Amy Smart as Kaylie.  While any time travel movie will have to have some sort of fantasy element that doesn't make sense, this one tried to stay as close to the truth as possible.  If you change one thing in the past, EVERYTHING changes .. and not always for the better.  I also thought the conclusion to the film was phenominal.  I couldn't have thought of a better way to end it without becoming cheesy and ruining the entire movie.Overall I'm giving this film 5 stars.  I really enjoyed it.

But hey, when the script, plot, and acting all fall through, at least Ashton Kutcher can promise that it will make a lot of money.So where to start on this mistake of a movie?  Well for starters there is the Butterfly Effect itself.  The title of this film is basically just another way to make this movie look more intriguing and intelligent than it actually is.  Never once is the so called Butterfly Effect even brought up; had the movie been called 'Timechanger' I could understand this, but the movie never justifies it's title.  There is no clear explanation of why or how Mr. Kutcher has these powers, the audience can't just suspend their disbelief in this film, they just have to follow it blindly wherever it goes. And, just on a side note, the changing of the present through altering the past is not actually The Butterfly Effect, it is just logic. The Butterfly Effect is actually a reference to a short Bradbury story in which a man (with a lot more logical reasoning) returns to the prehistoric world and returns with a Butterfly on his shoe.  So, you see, there actually is no Butterfly Effect, it was just a way to suck more people in.The plot is convoluded to say the least, but not in the way where the convolusion actually leads up to anything. The complications of this film are just a way of attempting to make this movie seem, well, just not so simple.  But in reality this is a very simple film, and all the convolusion just turns it into a terrible film.  Why did young Ashton have the knife again?  Why does his body react through inflamation every time he returns to the present? Why is it that the hispanic prison inmate has the ability to see him suddenly come back from the past?  These, and many more questions, are never answered, most likely for the fact that they never had an explanation to begin with.Many fans of this movie have said it is scary.  This is simply not the case, for there is a difference between being scary, and just using shock value to disturb the audience.  Blown off apendages, burning puppies, overly-violent children, nosebleeds, and child pornography are just a few of the 'disturbing' things that this movie hardly presents realistically and leaves this viewer feeling like he just got a stomach ache for no reason at all.If I could say one good thing about this movie it would be that Eric Stoltz (Hayleighs father) who is always a fine actor made me crack up in this movie.  The few lines that he has in the basement scene are pure gold, and it was the one part of the movie I actually enjoyed. To be honest, I'm surprised the director could get an actor as good as Stoltz for this debauchery.So, in summation, I don't think I have to tell you again that this movie is pointlessly complicated, terribly written, illogical and has an overall incomplete feeling to it.  It is the absolute worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of seeing.P.S -- When Ashton changes the past and returns to the present, only he knows he did it and only he can remember the original past, correct?  Well, if that is the case, than in the prison scene when Ashton goes back in time for his stereotyped-Hispanic cell mate to scar his hands and prove that he can go back in time, how come his cell mate is able to be just standing there and say ""Wow, you really did go back in time?""This follows no logic, because nobody but Ashton would know he went back in time because they would all be victims of the time changing.  His cell mate would of noticed the scars from the first day Ashton came to prison.  It really bothers me that a flaw this big could exist in a big-budget movie such as this.",1,The Absolute Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,1090022400,"07 17, 2004",2004,3645,"['hey', 'when', 'script', 'plot', 'acting', 'fall', 'least', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'can', 'promise', 'will', 'make', 'lot', 'money.So', 'where', 'start', 'mistake', 'movie', 'Well', 'starters', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'title', 'film', 'basically', 'just', 'way', 'make', 'movie', 'look', 'more', 'intriguing', 'intelligent', 'actually', 'Never', 'once', 'so', 'called', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'even', 'brought', 'up', 'had', 'movie', 'been', 'called', ""'Timechanger"", 'could', 'understand', 'movie', 'never', 'title', 'clear', 'explanation', 'why', 'how', 'Mr.', 'Kutcher', 'powers', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'film', 'just', 'have', 'follow', 'blindly', 'wherever', 'just', 'side', 'note', 'changing', 'present', 'altering', 'past', 'not', 'actually', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'just', 'logic', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'actually', 'reference', 'short', 'Bradbury', 'story', 'man', 'lot', 'more', 'logical', 'reasoning', 'prehistoric', 'world', 'returns', 'Butterfly', 'shoe', 'So', 'see', 'actually', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'suck', 'more', 'people', 'in.The', 'plot', 'convoluded', 'say', 'least', 'not', 'way', 'where', 'convolusion', 'actually', 'up', 'anything', 'complications', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'way', 'attempting', 'make', 'movie', 'seem', 'well', 'just', 'not', 'so', 'simple', 'reality', 'very', 'simple', 'film', 'convolusion', 'just', 'terrible', 'film', 'Why', 'did', 'young', 'Ashton', 'have', 'knife', 'again', 'Why', 'body', 'react', 'inflamation', 'time', 'present', 'Why', 'hispanic', 'prison', 'inmate', 'ability', 'see', 'suddenly', 'come', 'back', 'past', 'many', 'more', 'questions', 'are', 'never', 'answered', 'most', 'likely', 'fact', 'never', 'had', 'explanation', 'begin', 'with.Many', 'fans', 'movie', 'have', 'said', 'scary', 'simply', 'not', 'case', 'difference', 'being', 'scary', 'just', 'using', 'shock', 'value', 'disturb', 'audience', 'Blown', 'apendages', 'burning', 'puppies', 'overly-violent', 'children', 'nosebleeds', 'child', 'pornography', 'are', 'just', 'few', ""'disturbing"", 'things', 'movie', 'hardly', 'realistically', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'just', 'got', 'stomach', 'ache', 'reason', 'all.If', 'could', 'say', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'Hayleighs', 'father', 'who', 'always', 'fine', 'actor', 'made', 'crack', 'up', 'movie', 'few', 'lines', 'basement', 'scene', 'are', 'pure', 'gold', 'was', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'be', 'honest', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'director', 'could', 'get', 'actor', 'as', 'good', 'Stoltz', 'debauchery.So', 'summation', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'tell', 'again', 'movie', 'pointlessly', 'complicated', 'terribly', 'written', 'illogical', 'overall', 'incomplete', 'feeling', 'absolute', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'displeasure', 'seeing.P.S', 'When', 'Ashton', 'past', 'returns', 'present', 'only', 'did', 'only', 'can', 'remember', 'original', 'past', 'correct', 'Well', 'case', 'prison', 'scene', 'when', 'Ashton', 'back', 'time', 'stereotyped-Hispanic', 'cell', 'mate', 'scar', 'hands', 'prove', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'how', 'come', 'cell', 'mate', 'able', 'be', 'just', 'standing', 'there', 'say', 'Wow', 'really', 'did', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'logic', 'nobody', 'Ashton', 'would', 'know', 'went', 'back', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'victims', 'time', 'changing', 'cell', 'mate', 'would', 'noticed', 'scars', 'first', 'day', 'Ashton', 'came', 'prison', 'really', 'flaw', 'big', 'could', 'exist', 'big-budget', 'movie', 'such']",N/A

Butterfly Effect is based on the Chaos Theory and time traveling, which has been introduced in several other science fiction books and films.  Nonetheless, Butterfly Effect is not a science fiction film as it incorporates these two fundamental elements of philosophical thinking that are often connected with the future and progressive philosophy.Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) has memory lapses as a child through some severely distressing moments. Evan's mother becomes very concerned as she finds out that he has begun to display some bizarre traits in school and at home.  The mother is also concerned as Evan's father is institutionalized in a highly secure clinic and she is worried that Evan might begin to show the same traits as his father.  This leads the mother to contact a psychiatrist, who instructs Evan to begin to write a daily journal.Years later when Evan attends college as a psychology honors student he begins to have flashes of his past.  Evan returns to his childhood town to find out more about his past and he finds that his friends also suffer from the past traumatic events.  It troubles Evan that he and his friends endure deep emotional pain, which leads him to read his old journals in order to find a solution to the problems.  The reading opens Pandora's Box as he realizes that he can return to the past and change the future.Butterfly Effect has interesting premise, however, it falls short as it gives a serious attempt to depict two interesting philosophical notions.  The reasons for its shortcomings are the numerous plot holes and blunders in the story.  The film, at times, seems rushed and hurried as appropriate channels were not consulted before shooting several of the scenes.  This results in several awkward moments that are enhanced by the lead in the film.  Butterfly Effect begins extremely promising, but lands far from a great cinematic experience as the end credits roll.",3,Chaos Theory and Time Traveling in Ok Cinematic Experience,1095811200,"09 22, 2004",2004,2034,"['theory', 'butterfly', 'wing', 'Asia', 'can', 'cause', 'Hurricane', 'Caribbean', 'called', 'Chaos', 'Theory', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'based', 'Chaos', 'Theory', 'time', 'traveling', 'been', 'introduced', 'several', 'other', 'science', 'fiction', 'books', 'films', 'Nonetheless', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'two', 'fundamental', 'elements', 'philosophical', 'thinking', 'are', 'often', 'connected', 'future', 'progressive', 'philosophy.Evan', 'Treborn', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'memory', 'lapses', 'child', 'severely', 'distressing', 'moments', 'Evan', 'mother', 'very', 'concerned', 'out', 'begun', 'display', 'bizarre', 'traits', 'school', 'home', 'mother', 'also', 'concerned', 'Evan', 'father', 'institutionalized', 'highly', 'secure', 'clinic', 'worried', 'Evan', 'might', 'begin', 'show', 'same', 'traits', 'father', 'mother', 'contact', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'Evan', 'begin', 'write', 'daily', 'journal.Years', 'later', 'when', 'Evan', 'college', 'psychology', 'honors', 'student', 'have', 'flashes', 'past', 'Evan', 'childhood', 'town', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'past', 'friends', 'also', 'suffer', 'past', 'traumatic', 'events', 'Evan', 'friends', 'endure', 'deep', 'emotional', 'pain', 'read', 'old', 'journals', 'order', 'find', 'solution', 'problems', 'reading', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'can', 'return', 'past', 'change', 'future.Butterfly', 'Effect', 'interesting', 'premise', 'however', 'short', 'serious', 'attempt', 'depict', 'two', 'interesting', 'philosophical', 'notions', 'reasons', 'shortcomings', 'are', 'numerous', 'plot', 'holes', 'blunders', 'story', 'film', 'times', 'rushed', 'hurried', 'appropriate', 'channels', 'were', 'not', 'consulted', 'shooting', 'several', 'scenes', 'results', 'several', 'awkward', 'moments', 'are', 'enhanced', 'lead', 'film', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'extremely', 'promising', 'far', 'great', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'end', 'roll']",N/A

The script is terrible, it has some of the worst lines since ""I, Robot"" Yet, like ""I, Robot"" it has some astounding visuals and great amosphere. In the best scenes it looks like they are in a suburban paradise from a bygone era-- think ""Hearts in Atlantis"" and you'll get the idea. The choice to make the neighborhood seem outwardly idyllic is brilliant. As is the choice to make the institute seem similarly antichronistic. Other than that, there's not much to reccomend it.I don't put the fact I am physically disabled in my reviews very often, but I do have to say I was a little offended.

I would, instead, claim that the &quot;time travel&quot; sequences are used as a device merely to carry the dramatic elements of the film, which are really what the film seeks to convey.  If you can keep that in mind, you will most likely enjoy the film for what it tries to do.  Like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, the science behind exactly how Frankenstein created the monster was never really explained because it wasn't the point-- it was the social and philosophical consequences of the creation that mattered.And, wow, the social and philosophical elements that are examined in this film are heavy indeed.  While some of the characters as written in the script may be a little over the top, they are, nevertheless, engaging, entertaining and well-acted by all players, including the surprisingly serious Ashton Kutcher.  I would like to see more of him in this type of role, as he was very convincing, believe it or not.The director's cut ending, while actually fitting more with the darkness of the rest of the film, is so disturbing, you may have to question whether you prefer it to the theatrical ending if only for what it suggests about how we affect the lives of those around us.  The theatrical release ending allowed the main character to redeem himself without leaving the audience in utter destruction.  I am not suggesting that one is better, only that there was likely a very good reason why the director's ending didn't make it into the theater.  It's not that it isn't good; it's definitely worth seeing, but I would suggest not watching it if you are feeling a little down.

818189,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001Z52RU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","The basic idea of ""The Butterfly Effect"" appeals to me. I remember the Ray Bradbury short story where the guy goes back in time to shoot a T-Rex and changes the future because he comes back with a butterfly on his boot and enjoyed watching Sam trying to set the past to rights on ""Quantum Leap."" But the story from co-writers and co-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber also resonates with me because of an idea I had for short story about a rich guy who wants the Confederacy to win the Civil War. He sits in the time machine trying to select the right moment to go back and change history; he only has one shot and he sits there, going over all the options (e.g., assassinate Lincoln years earlier, help Pickett's charge succeed), unable to decide which would guarantee success.However, in ""The Butterfly Effect"" it turns out that Evan (Ashton Kutcher) has multiple opportunities for changing his past, although actally it is the past of Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart) that he wants to change. But his also means changing the past of Kayleigh's brother, Tommy (William Lee Scott) and their friend, Lenny (Elden Henson), as well as Evan's mother (Melora Walters) and his college roommate (Ethan Suplee). The problem is that every time he changes the past things do not necessarily get better as new problems are presented. But Evan keeps trying to find the magic solution that will set everything to rights, or at least what he thinks would be the best of all possible worlds.Evan and his friends had a trouble childhood. ""The Butterfly Effect"" takes place mainly in the present, but it also involves going back to when the kids were 7 and discovered that Mr. Miller (Eric Stolz) was a sicko and when they were 13 and something equally horrible happened. The first time we visit these events we do not know everything that happened because Evan does not remember; as a child he was afflicted with blackouts and since the film is told from his perspective we follow suit. Evan's mother is worried that he might have the same mental illness as his father, but Dr. Redfield (Nathaniel DeVaux) does not think so and has Evan start keeping a journal.In college Evan discovers that when he reads the journal entries he wrote in the past he can go back to that moment in time and that he can control what he says and does, thereby changing the present. This is certainly an interesting way of engaging in time travel (cf. Christopher Reeves thinks his way to the past in ""Somewhere in Time"") and I think ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a rather ambitious time travel film that is trying to be intelligent in terms of both the theory at work and the construction of the story. This is one of those films where you can better appreciate it the second time around, even if you do all the Infinifilm options, especially once you understand the rules for the game.In the end I am not sure if it is because the intelligence of the story by Bress and Gruber is not up to their ambition, but you cannot fault the effort. One of the strengths of this film is how it takes it time, as Evan wrestles with not only the changes in his world but struggles to figure out what he can do to make everything better the next time around. This is certainly superior to their previous effort, ""Final Destination 2"" and it will be interesting to see what they come up with next if they continue along this path. As for performances I would say that Amy Smart's is the best of the bunch and as for Ashton Kutcher, I know he is usually regarded as a tabloid joke or a television pretty boy, but this was actually the first film I have seen when I liked his character or his performance. He might be a forgotten actor by the end of the decade, but he gets props for showing some ambition. But in the final analysis this is Bress and Gruber's film and everybody is just along for the ride.I watched the director's cut (or, I guess, the directors' cut) before seeing the original theatrical ending or the two alternative endings (""Stalker"" and ""Happy Sappy"") and at this point would have to say the first one I saw is the best of the bunch. That is because while the effect remains the same the cause in the original theatrical release is just too simplistic after the complicated setup. Granted, the preferred version is rather dark and twisted, but if you listen to any of the commentary on the DVD you will understand their reasoning.",4,When you change who people are you destroy who they were,1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,4400,"['basic', 'idea', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'appeals', 'remember', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'short', 'story', 'where', 'guy', 'back', 'time', 'shoot', 'T-Rex', 'future', 'back', 'butterfly', 'boot', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Sam', 'trying', 'set', 'past', 'rights', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'story', 'co-writers', 'co-directors', 'Eric', 'Bress', 'J.', 'Mackye', 'Gruber', 'also', 'idea', 'had', 'short', 'story', 'rich', 'guy', 'who', 'Confederacy', 'win', 'Civil', 'War', 'time', 'machine', 'trying', 'select', 'right', 'moment', 'go', 'back', 'change', 'history', 'only', 'one', 'shot', 'there', 'going', 'options', 'e.g.', 'assassinate', 'Lincoln', 'years', 'earlier', 'help', 'Pickett', 'charge', 'succeed', 'unable', 'decide', 'would', 'guarantee', 'success.However', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'out', 'Evan', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'multiple', 'opportunities', 'changing', 'past', 'actally', 'past', 'Kayleigh', 'Miller', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'change', 'also', 'changing', 'past', 'Kayleigh', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'William', 'Lee', 'Scott', 'friend', 'Lenny', 'Elden', 'Henson', 'as', 'well', 'Evan', 'mother', 'Melora', 'Walters', 'college', 'roommate', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'problem', 'time', 'past', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'get', 'better', 'new', 'problems', 'are', 'presented', 'Evan', 'trying', 'find', 'magic', 'solution', 'will', 'set', 'everything', 'rights', 'least', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'possible', 'worlds.Evan', 'friends', 'had', 'trouble', 'childhood', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'place', 'mainly', 'present', 'also', 'going', 'back', 'when', 'kids', 'were', '7', 'discovered', 'Mr.', 'Miller', 'Eric', 'Stolz', 'was', 'sicko', 'when', 'were', '13', 'something', 'equally', 'horrible', 'happened', 'first', 'time', 'visit', 'events', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'everything', 'happened', 'Evan', 'not', 'remember', 'child', 'was', 'afflicted', 'blackouts', 'film', 'told', 'perspective', 'follow', 'suit', 'Evan', 'mother', 'worried', 'might', 'have', 'same', 'mental', 'illness', 'father', 'Dr.', 'Redfield', 'Nathaniel', 'DeVaux', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'Evan', 'start', 'keeping', 'journal.In', 'college', 'Evan', 'when', 'journal', 'entries', 'wrote', 'past', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'moment', 'time', 'can', 'control', 'what', 'thereby', 'changing', 'present', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'way', 'engaging', 'time', 'travel', 'cf', 'Christopher', 'way', 'past', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'think', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'rather', 'ambitious', 'time', 'travel', 'film', 'trying', 'be', 'intelligent', 'terms', 'theory', 'work', 'construction', 'story', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'can', 'better', 'appreciate', 'second', 'time', 'even', 'do', 'Infinifilm', 'options', 'especially', 'once', 'understand', 'rules', 'game.In', 'end', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'intelligence', 'story', 'Bress', 'Gruber', 'not', 'up', 'ambition', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'effort', 'One', 'strengths', 'film', 'how', 'time', 'Evan', 'not', 'only', 'changes', 'world', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'make', 'everything', 'next', 'time', 'around', 'certainly', 'superior', 'previous', 'effort', 'Final', 'Destination', '2', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'come', 'up', 'next', 'continue', 'path', 'performances', 'would', 'say', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'best', 'bunch', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'know', 'usually', 'regarded', 'tabloid', 'joke', 'television', 'pretty', 'boy', 'was', 'actually', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'when', 'liked', 'character', 'performance', 'might', 'be', 'forgotten', 'actor', 'end', 'decade', 'props', 'showing', 'ambition', 'final', 'analysis', 'Bress', 'Gruber', 'film', 'everybody', 'just', 'along', 'ride.I', 'watched', 'director', 'cut', 'guess', 'directors', 'cut', 'seeing', 'original', 'theatrical', 'ending', 'two', 'alternative', 'endings', 'Stalker', 'Happy', 'Sappy', 'point', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'first', 'one', 'saw', 'best', 'bunch', 'because', 'effect', 'same', 'cause', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'just', 'too', 'simplistic', 'complicated', 'setup', 'Granted', 'preferred', 'version', 'rather', 'dark', 'twisted', 'listen', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'will', 'understand', 'reasoning']",N/A

The ""Back To The Future"" trilogy plays with the concept, with strong characters, humor and juxtaposition.  ""12 Monkeys"" and the ""Terminator"" trilogy deal with end-of-the-world issues and the players who effect those events.  ""Timecop"" showcases Jean Clod very well, and takes us passionately into his feelings, as we see world events changed.  Other ""lesser"" attempts at the time-travel concept have been made into pretty good movies.The Butterfly Effect takes the allegedly simpler task of one small life and the small circle of friends who he may or may not have impacted.  Yet, the implications of one small change -- one butterfly-wing-sized change -- are shown to radically change the lives of that small circle of friends.  This movie masterfully chose to not try to make this story about world events or end-times events.  This choice actually intensifies the power-punch of the story, or should I say, ""stories.""Some may see in this movie a statement that we are only a product of our circumstances.  My title for this review refers to The Three Stooges (ugh, sorry ladies) episodes in which two professors make a bet that those three guys cannot be made into gentlemen by their environment being altered.  (I'll let you guess whether they were changed.)  Nevertheless, this movie does not claim this.I find the statement of this movie to be two-fold.First, it is saying that if you knew what has gone on in someone's life, perhaps you would be more compassionate toward them.Second, if you had to choose between you being blessed and your friends/family being in ruin, or you being a handi-capped, gimped, overlooked has-been while your friends/family are blessed, which would you choose??  Gotta confess, this put me in tears.I won't spoil it by saying more about the plot.My only complaint of the movie was that the first few minutes of acting seemed wooden, as if the shrink and mother were reading their lines.  Not only did they get better, but the acting, casting and camera-work in this movie are top-drawer.  The script must have been challenging, and I'd love to give it 6 stars!  The writer even handled the challenge of; how do you play out (for the viewer) so many different life scenarios, without the movie being 5-6 hours long?  I'll let you see how they did it.  And it worked!As for the difference between the ending in the director's cut v. standard VHS, I think the director's cut is a sign of lack of bravery.  The viewer wants a solution, not a cop-out.

This is a film that will appeal to those who enjoy seeing films or reading books that thematically deal with alternate realities or time travel.The butterfly effects refers to the chaos theory in physics. The bottom line is that every action has a reaction, often one that is seemingly unpredictable. That is probably the keyword to describe this compelling and intense film that is filled with complex relationships. Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), a college student interested in psychology, discovers for himself just how unpredictable life can be, when he finds a way to go back into his troubled past to try to right what went wrong with him and his three childhood friends, Lenny, Kayleigh, and her twin brother, Tommy. Unfortunately, the best intentions often go awry. Despite traveling back a numer of times into his past, each alternate reality has its own nightmarish permutations.This is an inventive, creative, well-done film with excellent performances by the entire cast. While Ashton Kutcher gives a fine, sensitive performance as the angst ridden Evan Treborn, he is, however, outshone by the two child actors who play the role of Evan Treborn as a seven year old (Logan Lerman) and as a thirteen year old (John Patrick Amedori). In fact, three talented sets of actors play the roles of Evan and his three childhood friends at ages seven, thirteen, and as young adults.Melora Walters gives a well-nuanced performance as Andrea Treborn, Evan's mother. Amy Smart gives a wonderful performance as the adult Kayleigh Miller, a very special childhood friend and the love of Evan's life, who acts as the catalyst for his entry into the wacky world of alternate realities. Jesse James gives a riveting performance as the thirteen years old Tommy Miller, Kayleigh's psychotic twin brother. Look for Eric Stoltz in the small, pivotal role of Mr. Miller, Kayleigh's father, whose fresh faced looks belie a man steeped in perversion and cruelty.Writers-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber provide a fresh and inventive script with labyrinthine twists and turns that, coupled with deft direction, give rise to a compelling, mind bending film that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen. This is definitely a film that one will want to view more than once, as the DVD provides both the director's cut and the theatrical release and is packed with many extras.

At early points, he is molested by a friend's father and later he is shown doing mischevious things with friends (the exact nature of which does not become clear until later in the movie).2. Eventually, he finds that he has some type of power to think about things and go back in time to change them.3. Changing things leads to several different outcomes-- all of which are unsatisfactory (for him, but amusing for us).4. Eventually, he decides that the only way to do things is to commit suicide (which he does in the womb).The idea of this movie is not strictly Chaos Theory (which is misstated in the very beginning of the movie), and which correctly is: ""Small changes in initial conditions can have large changes in the final result."" This movie was more strictly making a cinematic version of Milan Kundera's ""The Joke"" or ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" (=there is no reason that It Must Be....It Could Very Well Have Been Otherwise).That all said: There were some funny parts in the film (1), and the character acting made it all work very well. Children actors are normally a ""vacuum that nature has every right to abhor."" But even these children were very good and the characters in one state were so believable that it was all the more interesting that they could be equally believable when portrayed in such radically opposite ways.This movie is worth an evening movie ticket price.",5,Good-- even though a misunderstanding of Chaos Theory.,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,1478,"['Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary:1', 'movie', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'child', 'early', 'points', 'molested', 'friend', 'father', 'later', 'shown', 'doing', 'mischevious', 'things', 'friends', 'exact', 'nature', 'not', 'become', 'clear', 'later', 'movie', '.2', 'Eventually', 'type', 'power', 'think', 'things', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'change', 'them.3', 'Changing', 'things', 'several', 'different', 'outcomes', 'are', 'unsatisfactory', 'amusing', '.4', 'Eventually', 'only', 'way', 'do', 'things', 'commit', 'suicide', 'womb', 'idea', 'movie', 'not', 'strictly', 'Chaos', 'Theory', 'misstated', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'correctly', 'Small', 'changes', 'initial', 'conditions', 'can', 'have', 'large', 'changes', 'final', 'result', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'strictly', 'making', 'cinematic', 'version', 'Milan', 'Kundera', 'Joke', 'Unbearable', 'Lightness', 'Being', 'reason', 'Must', 'Be', '.It', 'Could', 'Very', 'Well', 'Have', 'Been', 'Otherwise', 'said', 'were', 'funny', 'parts', 'film', '1', 'character', 'acting', 'made', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Children', 'actors', 'are', 'normally', 'vacuum', 'nature', 'right', 'abhor', 'even', 'children', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'characters', 'one', 'state', 'were', 'so', 'believable', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'could', 'be', 'equally', 'believable', 'when', 'portrayed', 'such', 'radically', 'opposite', 'ways.This', 'movie', 'evening', 'movie', 'ticket', 'price']",N/A

818196,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B0001Z52RU,Lleu Christopher,"[1, 1]","The surprising thing about The Butterfly Effect is how entertaining it is, considering its flaws. The title comes from a theory that the movement of a butterfly's wings could theoretically cause a hurricane halfway around the world.This film explores the possibility that changing one aspect of the past would have unforeseeable consequences. I found the premise interesting enough that I was able to overlook --most of the time-- the often amateurish way it was executed. Ashton Kutcher plays Evan, a young man who discovers that, by reading journals written as a child, he is able to re-enter the past and change events. These events all revolve around his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh (Amy Smart), her sociopathic brother Tommy (William Lee Scott) and their friend Lenny (Elden Henson). Evan learns that his father also had this ability, though it drove him to insanity.I found the story engrossing from beginning to end. The problem is, writers/directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber apparently felt compelled to keep the action at the level of ""B"" horror movie schlock. Everything is over-the-top. Every time Evan changes something, someone is either brutally murdered or maimed; in one scene a dog is set on fire. Several outcomes involving an accident with a firecracker each lead to the goriest imaginable results. In one scenario, Kayleigh becomes a prostitute, and her appearance, and that of the run-down hotel where she lives is almost a parody. So are several other scenes, including one where Evan is about to be sodomized by Nazi inmates in a prison, and another where he winds up an invalid. Rather than being confident in the basic premise of the story, the film distracts us with superfluous gore and melodrama.Despite all of this, I still enjoyed this movie and remained interested right through the last scene. Changing the past may be like a cosmic Rubik's Cube. Every time Evan changes one event, some other unexpected (and catastrophic) thing happens. The premise is similar to the more lighthearted (and better done) Groundhog Day. Ashton Kutcher's performance in this film has been criticized, but considering the improbable series of changes and misadventures he is put through, he doesn't do a bad job. The other actors (including the childhood versions of the adults) all give good performances. The Butterfly Effect is an interesting and compelling movie that, had it been toned down a little (or maybe a lot) could have been much better.",3,Would you really want to change the past?,1089849600,"07 15, 2004",2004,2471,"['surprising', 'thing', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'how', 'entertaining', 'considering', 'flaws', 'title', 'theory', 'movement', 'butterfly', 'wings', 'could', 'theoretically', 'cause', 'hurricane', 'halfway', 'world.This', 'film', 'possibility', 'changing', 'one', 'aspect', 'past', 'would', 'have', 'unforeseeable', 'consequences', 'found', 'premise', 'interesting', 'was', 'able', 'overlook', 'most', 'time', 'often', 'amateurish', 'way', 'was', 'executed', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Evan', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'reading', 'journals', 'written', 'child', 'able', 're-enter', 'past', 'change', 'events', 'events', 'revolve', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Kayleigh', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'sociopathic', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'William', 'Lee', 'Scott', 'friend', 'Lenny', 'Elden', 'Henson', 'Evan', 'father', 'also', 'had', 'ability', 'drove', 'insanity.I', 'found', 'story', 'engrossing', 'beginning', 'end', 'problem', 'writers/directors', 'Eric', 'Bress', 'J.', 'Mackye', 'Gruber', 'apparently', 'felt', 'compelled', 'keep', 'action', 'level', 'B', 'horror', 'movie', 'schlock', 'Everything', 'over-the-top', 'Every', 'time', 'Evan', 'changes', 'something', 'someone', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'maimed', 'one', 'scene', 'dog', 'set', 'fire', 'Several', 'outcomes', 'involving', 'accident', 'firecracker', 'lead', 'goriest', 'imaginable', 'results', 'one', 'scenario', 'Kayleigh', 'prostitute', 'appearance', 'run-down', 'hotel', 'where', 'almost', 'parody', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'where', 'Evan', 'be', 'sodomized', 'Nazi', 'inmates', 'prison', 'where', 'up', 'invalid', 'Rather', 'being', 'confident', 'basic', 'premise', 'story', 'film', 'superfluous', 'gore', 'melodrama.Despite', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'remained', 'interested', 'right', 'last', 'scene', 'Changing', 'past', 'may', 'be', 'cosmic', 'Rubik', 'Cube', 'Every', 'time', 'Evan', 'one', 'event', 'other', 'unexpected', 'catastrophic', 'thing', 'premise', 'similar', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'better', 'done', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'performance', 'film', 'been', 'criticized', 'considering', 'improbable', 'series', 'changes', 'misadventures', 'put', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'other', 'actors', 'including', 'childhood', 'versions', 'adults', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'little', 'maybe', 'lot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better']",N/A

It's not a fun film to watch, in fact, it's very tragic and depressing, but it's also engrossing, well-made, and exceptionally acted. Ashton Kutcher shows that not only can he pull off some funny pranks, but he can support a dramatic film as well. Melora Walters, with her meak voice and undeniable maternal presence, was the perfect choice to play his mother. Amy Smart, beautiful and innocent, was wonderful as Ashton's sometimes girlfriend. She had the most difficult job because she gets to change personalities so quickly, and she pulled it off very well.The film was brutal, way too honest, and at times, very tough to take, but I loved how it didn't shy away from the tragedies in life like most movies do. This is a terrific film, one of the best of the year in my opinion, that manages to leave a mark and lingers in the mind long afterward. It does try to tackle way too much in too short a period, but it manages to crawl under the skin and refuses to come out. After a string of very disappointing Hollywood thrillers, The Butterfly Effect was a very refreshing change of pace; a Hollywood thriller that actually thrills. The theatrical trailer, included on the DVD, did not do it justice.Note: While some viewers prefer the Direcor's Cut of the film, I was surprised because I think the Theatrical Version is a much better film. More tightly paced and with a far superior ending, the Theatrical Version is the definitive one to watch. Out of curiosity though, pop in the Director's Cut on the flip side and watch the final 5 minutes to see the main difference between both versions. While both are emotional, the Theatrical Version has a better ending that is more suitable to the film. Both versions are GREAT, but surprisingly, I prefer the original theatrical one since usually, the Direcor's Cut fairs better.I recommend this film.

818206,AWPODHOB4GFWL,B0001Z52RU,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[0, 0]","Evan (Ashton Kutcher) and Andrea (Amy Smart) are childhood friends. When Evan goes to college he discovers that by simply reading his childhood journals, he can go back in time and change some unpleasant memories for the better. However, others see Evan as a genetic equivalent of his institutionalized father. The premise is clever and the acting is good, but the scenarios become more and more confusing as Evan goes back in time and tries to change one bad childhood event only to realize that it makes another one even worse. Every time Evan goes back in time to various ages, he has his adult mind and can forcibly change the outcome of the killing of his dog, a murder, an accident, a girlfriend going into prostitution or a truly, unnecessary case of child molestation.This film is targeted for the teen crowd and no doubt will be a large crowd pleaser on DVD. However, there are some small items that `scream' Hollywood inconsistencies. Evans childhood drawing is so good that it Looks like a Disney animator drew it. His journal is miraculously meticulous even though it is written at break-neck speed. These are minor events that remind us we are watching a movie (not a good thing), but some of the scenes of animal cruelty and child molestation (talked about - never shown) are extremely unpleasant. This is the kind of reality that can be done in a more effective way without the gruesome visuals.This is a tough movie to criticize as it does entertain, but I must admit, the ending can be predictable if you watch the first few scenes closely enough.

The acting ranges from acceptable to excellent. But its problem is that the screenwriters, Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, who also directed the movie, were not able to carry their interesting premise to a satisfactory conclusion, either as entertainment or as profound statement. In other words, it doesn't work well as either art or as pop culture.The movie is based on the theory of chaos, a plausible idea that supposes that the universe is not based on order but on chaos.The protagonist, Evan [Aston Kutcher], who is his early 20s, has always had a memory problem. To counter this, he's kept journals since he was very young. Very bad things seemingly happen to Evan in his youth. Later, as he reads his entries, he is able to go back and rearrange the past. His efforts result in an uglier, more chaotic present. It never occurs to Evan that many of the events he is trying to change occurred only in his imagination. Maybe Evan himself is Chaos.Kutcher is adequate as Evan. Melora Walters is very good as his mother. By far the best performance is given by Amy Smart. She plays Kayleigh, Evan's traumatized childhood friend, who grows up to be a college student, a forlorn waitress or a hooker, depending on how Evan changes the future.If the writers had been able to flesh out their premise, this would have been a really interesting movie. As the story starts to flounder, the old `you can't change fate' premise comes in.

I was expecting to see a moderately entertaining class B film and discovered a hard, solid and intelligent cinematographic work.The story is quite complicate and requires the audience to be paying special attention.It starts showing Evan, a young boy, whose father is interned in a psychiatric institution and his mother is stressed fulfilling maternal and paternal roles.He is prone to suffer blackouts which left him without recollection of what happened pending them.The psychiatrist that had nursed his father is consulted and recommends him to keep a detailed diary as to enhance his memory.Several critical scenes with Evan passing out and covering a period of 15 years are shown.He finally gets into university, applies to study psychology and specializes in memory phenomena.Suddenly when reading his diary he is able to remember what happened that time, but not only that he actually ""re-lived"" the moment.That's the real kick-off the action. He is able to go back and change some critical fact (trying to suppress evil consequences). Well... those consequences ARE suppressed but a sort of new alternate universe emerges and... new awful events will occur or has already occurred.Evan doggedly goes back time and again, muddling everything up to the last desperate effort.The film is co-directed and co-wrote by Eric Bress & J. Mackey Gruber and they prove to be a good team in both aspects. I hope they'll keep this quality level in future releases.Playacting is compact and convincing. The group of kid & juvenile actors and actress keep a resemblance with the adult characters really astounding (I don't know if it was enhanced by make-up or other techniques).It is a shocking movie. Some scenes are revulsive but not gratuitously as I've seen in many recent films. So be aware of this situation in order to decide who will be able to see it and who don't.This is a highly recommended film for sci-fi aficionados and general public.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",4,The Ceaseless Pain!,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,2045,"['Butterfly', 'Effect', '2004', 'very', 'much', 'underrated', 'gripping', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'class', 'B', 'film', 'discovered', 'hard', 'solid', 'intelligent', 'cinematographic', 'work.The', 'story', 'quite', 'complicate', 'audience', 'be', 'paying', 'special', 'attention.It', 'showing', 'Evan', 'young', 'boy', 'father', 'interned', 'psychiatric', 'institution', 'mother', 'stressed', 'fulfilling', 'maternal', 'paternal', 'roles.He', 'prone', 'suffer', 'blackouts', 'left', 'recollection', 'what', 'happened', 'pending', 'them.The', 'psychiatrist', 'had', 'nursed', 'father', 'consulted', 'keep', 'detailed', 'diary', 'enhance', 'memory.Several', 'critical', 'scenes', 'Evan', 'passing', 'out', 'covering', 'period', '15', 'years', 'are', 'shown.He', 'finally', 'university', 'applies', 'study', 'psychology', 'memory', 'phenomena.Suddenly', 'when', 'reading', 'diary', 'able', 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'actually', 're-lived', 'moment.That', 'real', 'kick-off', 'action', 'able', 'go', 'back', 'change', 'critical', 'fact', 'trying', 'suppress', 'evil', 'consequences', 'Well', 'consequences', 'ARE', 'suppressed', 'sort', 'new', 'alternate', 'universe', 'emerges', 'new', 'awful', 'events', 'will', 'occur', 'already', 'occurred.Evan', 'doggedly', 'back', 'time', 'again', 'muddling', 'everything', 'up', 'last', 'desperate', 'effort.The', 'film', 'co-directed', 'co-wrote', 'Eric', 'Bress', 'J.', 'Mackey', 'Gruber', 'prove', 'be', 'good', 'team', 'aspects', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'quality', 'level', 'future', 'releases.Playacting', 'compact', 'convincing', 'group', 'kid', 'juvenile', 'actors', 'actress', 'keep', 'resemblance', 'adult', 'characters', 'really', 'astounding', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'enhanced', 'make-up', 'other', 'techniques', '.It', 'shocking', 'movie', 'scenes', 'are', 'revulsive', 'not', 'gratuitously', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'recent', 'films', 'So', 'be', 'aware', 'situation', 'order', 'decide', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'who', ""don't.This"", 'highly', 'recommended', 'film', 'sci-fi', 'aficionados', 'general', 'public.Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

But add slightly longer, less dorky hair, and a beard, then my eyes literally go out on stalks in my head! Plus, a lovely scene for the ladeez - he appears in little more than a towel at one point, which is very low-slung, and all the females will be yelling at the screen to get him to drop it! That doesn't necessarily mean I like guys with beards - they're OK to look at, it's a totally different matter if you go to kiss them!I've read the novelisation of this, and absolutely loved it. The film is absolutely terrific too, although I missed the first couple of minutes, due to not finding a parking space! All people seem to know Ashton Kutcher for is playing dorky roles/playing dorky roles/ditching Brittany Murphy for Bruce Willis' ex. Wow. What they don't realise is he can pretty much do a serious role, AND he exec-produced it too. Just a little thing to add his CV.If you've read the book, you'll pretty much understand what happens when the film suddenly jumps forward 5 minutes or so. Unfortunately, I went with someone who hadn't read the book, and I kept getting elbows in my ribs every two seconds, asking what the hell was going on! All the 'missing' sections appear later in the movie, but I kinda knew what was happening. It takes a lot to have at least some intelligence.Amy Smart (who I've mainly known from Rat Race) plays the role of Caillie brilliantly. Her image constantly changes throughout the film (think Jenny's sometimes drastic image changes in Forrest Gump).If you're expecting the ending to be very predictable, you'd be wrong. I couldn't really remember what the ending was from the book (need to re-read it now!), and I was quite surprised. It's one of those ""what if?"" endings, totally not what you're expecting to happen.If you get a chance to see this movie, GO SEE IT! You won't regret it. Or get the DVD. Whatever suits you.

That kid could have done several things to avoid the beatdown he got from little 9 year old Tommy (stepped on him, flicked him in the forehead, picked him up and tossed him into the corner, etc).  And not to be nitpicky, but if you notice the outside of the theater, two of the movies playing are Se7en and Dumb and Dumber.

Each time you watch in anticipation of the twist for the new reality.Kutcher is a troubled youth who was molested along with a young girl, by the girl's father and later is bullied by the girl's brother.  The girl ends up committing suicide and Kutcher's life is haunted by his past.  Kutcher is told by his analyst to keep a diary of everything that happens.  In his college years, Kutcher finds that when he re-reads his diary, he is suddenly transported back to the actual events depicted in the diary. Each time Kutcher tries to make some adjustment to that event, to try to make things turn out better.  But like the story of the butterfly that caused a tidal wave to occur, each little ""adjustment"" for the good has a ripple effect on the future that causes not necessarily pleasant results.I was riveted by this movie until the end.

818217,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B0001Z52RU,Michael Crane,"[97, 108]","While &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; wasn't critically acclaimed or well loved by everyone, I thought it was a pretty good movie when I first saw it at the theatres.  It was a dark and completely disturbing film that made me want to look away at times, but at the same time I was very intrigued.  My only problem was the ending.  I thought it really contradicted the whole theme of the movie, but I always suspected that the so-called &quot;happy ending&quot; was forced upon since the movie is so dark and hard to watch that they thought there was no way people would like it if a more darker and depressing ending were added.  Well, now you get to see the director's cut of the film that's on this very DVD, which offers the superior ending.Evan had terrible blackouts when he was little, very much like his father.  He would blackout during terrible situations and not remember anything.  That's when it was suggested to him that he keep a journal to see if he could remember what happened during those blackouts.  When Evan is all grown up, still haunted by his terrible past that had blanketed him and his friends, he discovers that he can relive those memories when he reads his entries.  He can view it like a movie and finally see what had happened during his blackouts.  Not only that, but he has the power to even alter those moments.  Determined to fix the pasts of him and his friends, he relives those memories and tries to fix them so they will all have a better future.  However, when he tries to change one thing, it leads to devastating results that he could have never foreseen.  As the cover says, &quot;Change one thing... change EVERYTHING.&quot;I found this film to be very interesting and complex, even though I felt that the film itself was not perfect.  The movie is very hard to watch at times, so it's not recommended for those who don't like being disturbed or who are extremely sensitive to such matters.  I think it has a smart storyline and great acting.  Believe it or not, Ashton Kutcher is able to act in a serious role.  I didn't even recognize him at first, but he really pulled it off.  He was able to convince me that he was in fact &quot;Evan,&quot; as he played the role with determination and force.As I said in the beginning, my major problem with the movie had always been the ending.  While it was happy and nice to see that things worked out considering the absolute hell this movie can put you through, I still found the ending to be contradictive and a &quot;cop-out.&quot;  Now, all of that's changed as you are given the choice to either watch the theatrical version, OR the director's cut.  The director's cut offers a few more extra minutes that adds more substance to the story (including an interesting find) and a more appropriate ending.  If you were to ask me which version is better, I'd say that the director's cut is without any hesitation  The new ending does a better job of fitting in with the theme of the movie and doesn't contradict the film as the theatrical ending does.  The DVD also offers &quot;infinifilm&quot; features that give you a deeper insight to the movie itself.  Extras included are commentary, documentaries, storyboard galleries and much more.  I must say that the film looks great, and also sounds fantastic as well.&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; proves to be an even stronger film with the director's cut version, even if it's still not a perfect movie.  If you're looking for something a little more darker and sinister than your regular picks, then this is something to consider.  Just remember that this movie does not let you off easy.  It's brutal and extremely disturbing.  If you're daring and think you can handle it, then pick this up and prepare for one unforgettable and chilling ride. -Michael Crane",4,&quot;You were happy once... with me.&quot;,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,3800,"['quot', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'quot', 'was', ""n't"", 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'well', 'loved', 'everyone', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'theatres', 'was', 'dark', 'completely', 'disturbing', 'film', 'made', 'want', 'look', 'away', 'times', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'intrigued', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'ending', 'thought', 'really', 'contradicted', 'whole', 'theme', 'movie', 'always', 'suspected', 'so-called', 'quot', 'happy', 'ending', 'quot', 'was', 'forced', 'movie', 'so', 'dark', 'hard', 'watch', 'thought', 'was', 'way', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'more', 'darker', 'depressing', 'ending', 'were', 'added', 'Well', 'now', 'get', 'see', 'director', 'cut', 'film', 'very', 'DVD', 'superior', 'ending.Evan', 'had', 'terrible', 'blackouts', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'very', 'much', 'father', 'would', 'blackout', 'terrible', 'situations', 'not', 'remember', 'anything', 'when', 'was', 'suggested', 'keep', 'journal', 'see', 'could', 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'blackouts', 'When', 'Evan', 'grown', 'up', 'still', 'haunted', 'terrible', 'past', 'had', 'blanketed', 'friends', 'can', 'relive', 'memories', 'when', 'entries', 'can', 'view', 'movie', 'finally', 'see', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'blackouts', 'Not', 'only', 'power', 'even', 'alter', 'moments', 'Determined', 'fix', 'pasts', 'friends', 'memories', 'tries', 'fix', 'so', 'will', 'have', 'better', 'future', 'However', 'when', 'change', 'one', 'thing', 'devastating', 'results', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'foreseen', 'cover', 'quot', 'Change', 'one', 'thing', 'change', 'EVERYTHING.', 'quot', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'complex', 'even', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'not', 'recommended', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'disturbed', 'who', 'are', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'such', 'matters', 'think', 'smart', 'storyline', 'great', 'acting', 'Believe', 'not', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'able', 'act', 'serious', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'first', 'really', 'pulled', 'off', 'was', 'able', 'convince', 'was', 'fact', 'quot', 'Evan', 'quot', 'played', 'role', 'determination', 'force.As', 'said', 'beginning', 'major', 'problem', 'movie', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'ending', 'was', 'happy', 'nice', 'see', 'things', 'worked', 'out', 'considering', 'absolute', 'hell', 'movie', 'can', 'put', 'still', 'found', 'ending', 'be', 'contradictive', 'quot', 'cop-out.', 'quot', 'Now', 'changed', 'are', 'given', 'choice', 'watch', 'theatrical', 'version', 'OR', 'director', 'cut', 'director', 'cut', 'few', 'more', 'extra', 'minutes', 'more', 'substance', 'story', 'including', 'interesting', 'find', 'more', 'appropriate', 'ending', 'were', 'ask', 'version', 'better', ""'d"", 'say', 'director', 'cut', 'hesitation', 'new', 'ending', 'better', 'job', 'fitting', 'theme', 'movie', ""n't"", 'contradict', 'film', 'theatrical', 'ending', 'DVD', 'also', 'quot', 'quot', 'features', 'give', 'deeper', 'insight', 'movie', 'Extras', 'included', 'are', 'commentary', 'documentaries', 'storyboard', 'galleries', 'much', 'more', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'great', 'also', 'fantastic', 'well.', 'quot', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'quot', 'be', 'even', 'stronger', 'film', 'director', 'cut', 'version', 'even', 'still', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'darker', 'sinister', 'regular', 'picks', 'then', 'something', 'consider', 'Just', 'remember', 'movie', 'not', 'let', 'off', 'easy', 'brutal', 'extremely', 'disturbing', ""'re"", 'daring', 'think', 'can', 'handle', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'prepare', 'one', 'unforgettable', 'chilling', 'ride', '-Michael', 'Crane']",N/A

Anytime the subject of time travel is approached, it usually makes for an interesting and exciting film. However, the film did have the critics going against it, and Ashton Kutcher trying to play in a dramatic role.I finally got to see the movie recently, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this film turned out to be. While it is not the best time travel film I have ever seen, it was extremely entertaining and suspenseful to see all the different lifetimes being played out. I really enjoyed the fact that Kutcher's character used his mind to travel in time and not a machine. The movie can be frustrating at times. In fact, after the first 20 minutes of the film I had serious doubts. Things would happen, followed by Ashton's Kutcher's character having a blackout right at the moment when an explanation was needed. This left myself and the rest of the audience feeling confused at what was playing out. But after the film gets over the initial speed bump in the beginning, The Butterfly Effect turns into a riveting thriller and everything is explained in the long run. The entire cast did a fantastic job in my opinion. While I still feel that Ashton Kutcher is not a very good actor, he did a lot better than I thought he would. Especially, when you consider the fact that he is known for being a comedy actor.One of the best things about this film was the ending. It was not your typical happy ending. While every character's life turned out for the better, Kutcher's character still experiences loss and regret by how the story turns out. I was very happy with the ending, because it actually manages to leave your emotions feeling conflicted, which gets you thinking about how things could have been. Anytime you leave the theater in discussion about what you would have done differently, it means that the film made an impression on you. That is definately something that The Butterfly Effect manages to do.I really don't understand the harsh treatment from critics. In Entertainment Weekly, the average grade for this film is a ""C-"".

I finally gave in to all the people I know telling me just how great this movie was and I rented it today. I will be buying this movie first thing tomorrow, that's how great it is. I am not a fan of Ashton Kutcher at all, but he actually played the low-key part rather well. He wasn't great, but he also wasn't even close to being bad either. His performance fell somewhere in between, but more on the good side. Amy Smart also turns in a solid performance playing both a beautiful college hottie and a drugged up prostitute. I must say though that this film is MUCH darker than expected. I mean this is borderline ""Seven"" material. There are some scenes and talk about child pornography, a demonic kid who kills animals and threatens to kill people, a fat annoying gothic roommate (he was disturbing to me!), and many other images of discomfort. Both versions of the film are great, but The Director's Cut is the true version that should be seen, because this was the original superior version before the studio heads wanted a more happy flow to end the film with. This film also boasts some nice Special FX and a moving soundtrack. I couldn't believe that my 50-year-old mother loved the film as much as I did, so that truly shows that anyone over age 16 should enjoy this movie. If you can see through the grisly darkness (which was actually thrown in to tap into your own emotions about disturbing issues) then you will be rewarded with one of the best films of last year.

No cause for these blank spots in his life was ever found in spite of extensive tests. His father suffered a similar problem and was institutionalised, Evan is afraid this will be his fate too. To try and make sense of what was going on he was encouraged to keep a daily journal. Although Evan had no memory of what happened during these episodes it was obvious from the behaviour of those around him that some horrific and traumatising events had happened.When his mother decides to move the family to a different town the blackouts stop. Evan grows up and moves away to university. This is where the film takes a twist. Evan finds that reading his journals propels him into the past, to the events that scarred him and those he cared for, particularly his childhood sweetheart, Kayleigh. He realises that he can control this and even change the events. But like the saying `when a butterfly flaps its wings a hurricane is felt on the other side of the world', Evan finds that for everything he changes, there is a knock on effect and it isn't necessarily good.This is a dark and at times very disturbing film. The situations Evan faces are, at times, nightmarish. Ashton Kutcher, better known for lightweight comedic roles, shows he is capable of taking on more serious roles.

818237,A3VS8L85Y9FSZK,B0001Z52RU,"Nathan Thoms ""Nate""","[1, 1]","The Butterfly Effect is the must-see directorial debut from directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, who worked previously together as a screenwriting team forFinal Destination 2.  Ashton Kutcher, made famous by his role onThat '70s Show - Season 7, stars in this film as Evan Treborn, a man who periodically blacks out due to a rare neural disorder he shares with his institutionalized father.  Evan and his best friend Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart fromRoad Trip (Unrated Edition)andRat Race (Special Collector's Edition)), her brother Tommy (William Lee Scott), and Lenny (Eldon Henson), grow up in a hellish childhood environment and are all traumatized by a childhood incident where a woman and her baby are killed very gruesomely.  In an effort to help him recall blacked out memories, Evan begins to keep meticulous journals of his daily life.  Later, while reading the journals in college he discovers that, in addition to helping him remember the blacked out events, he finds he has the ability to change the incidents in question.  Evan begins trying to better the lives of his group of friends by changing the incidents he believes lead to their later depression, institutionalization, suicides, imprisonment, and general harm.  He soon discovers that every change he makes has grand consequences that often only worsen his friends' fates.Concisely put, the only element missing from 'The Butterfly Effect,' is a more effective soundtrack.  Bearing that in mind, this film is a phenomenal journey through the lives of this group of friends and even with that minor flaw, it remains a gleaming treasure. While 'The Butterfly Effect' is an incredibly impressive film, Amy Smart's performance is particularly noteworthy as it really brings the raw emotional feeling of regret that permeates the film's style and story.  Her character's ever more dramatic tragedy is portrayed by Smart brilliantly.  This film has successfully brought Smart out of her supporting role shell and into her fuller potential as a great actress.One might expect Ashton Kutcher to be a limiting factor in the overall quality of this film, but he is surprisingly competent in a more serious role and, while his performance doesn't compare with Smart's, he is able to hold his own.  The most important aspect of this film is definitely the direction.  The same raw emotional tension that was infused into the trailer is present throughout 'The Butterfly Effect,' which only serves to draw the viewer ever deeper into the storyline.  Directors Bress and Gruber's contribution combines a solid script, several great performances, and an emotional style of filming, skilled direction, and special effects that nicely compliment the story.

818239,A3713PP4MADKED,B0001Z52RU,"Nick Watkins ""Nick Watkins""","[2, 6]","Before I start this review, I'll just say that I expected this to suck because I hate Ashton Kutcher. He used to be just another funny and entertaining guy when he was in &quot;Dude, Where's My Car?&quot; and on &quot;That 70's Show&quot;, but then he started &quot;Punk'd&quot; and since then he has annoyed the s*it out of me. But for some reason I watched this movie with a friend anyway.It's definetly confusing and bizarre as hell at first. Quick edits representing black-outs that leaves you wondering what happened. Let me explain. The movie starts with Kutcher's character, Evan, as a kid. Is shows that he often has black-outs and can't remember what happened, just like his Father did. One day, Evan draws a picture of himself on top of a pile of dead bodies with a knife, which catches his teacher's attention and she calls Evan's Mom. Evan's Dad was a psycho, or at least everyone thoughthe was, and Evan's Mom starts to worry that her son has caught his Father's &quot;sickness&quot;, and only furthers her belief in that when she catches Evan standing in the kitchen with a knife, for no apparent reason. Also in his child-hood, Evan is tricked by his best friend's Dad to strip down and get into his 'Robin Hood' movie, just an excuse for his friend's Dad to get a little kiddie porno.Then we fast forward a few years and Evan's probably around 13 or 14. His best friend, the girl who's Dad took the video of, and her sadistic brother and their other friend decide to blow up a toy doll house, which, in the end, has severe consequences. Also in this time-span the sadistic brother named Tommy torches Evan's dog and beats up a kid at the movies with a pole. Seems like the filmmakes wanted an excuse to be as senselessly offensive as possible so far, huh? Well, in the end, all of this does add up and the reason for showing all this is revealed.We fast-forward again and Evan is now in college with his goth roommate, who's pretty freaky, but he has some good music playing. Evan's life has been good; no black-outs for a number of years and he's almost completely forgotten about his childhood problems, that is until he brings a girl back to his dorm who gets him to read her his diaries he'd been keeping since he was 7. That's when we learn that Evan can time travel, in a way.Eventually, Evan starts reading his journals which can take him back to the time when they happened, where he can try to fix it, then he will wake up in the situation he would have been in if he had 'fixed' it. However, there are always consequences either for him or for his friends and he can never seem to find a good outcome...until the end of the movie. I suggest watching the director's cut on the DVD because, even though the end is a little unbelievable, it is a better ending than that on the original theatrical version.So...is this an awesome movie? Not really. But it gets you to think and it's always fun to see how Evan turns out every time he tries to fix something. And the end of the director's cut will definetly get you.

The premise is pretty absurd, but the film succeeds in getting the viewers suspension of disbelief on board.There is material for a really good picture here. The script is an interesting parable about responsibility and fate, and the impact one's actions can have one the course of several lives, yours and that of those around you, who are intertwined with your own. The script does a pretty good job of exploring this theme, and Kutcher's acting is better than it usually is, suggesting he may mature into quite a good actor in the future.Unfortunately, the storytelling is amateurish in the begining of the film. The characters sound like their made of cardboard, and don't really come to life. Instead young Evan lives in a stereotyped world, in a neighborhood peopled with characters and situations you could swear you've seen in a million other movies.This is particularly unfortunate because what could have been a really good movie is marred by its begining, and never quite recovers from the underdeveloped characters.

This is just my opinion.I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone. Due to a high content of bad words (being used left and right by children, women, etc), screaming and violence, it's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else. My ears got tired half-way through the movie. The violence committed by kids is just not realistic. Some people may say that kids can grow up violent if treated badly or molested, but I think the way it's presented in this movie is over-the-edge.Some people really enjoyed it, and that's not me, and that's not the other two people I know who watched it. This movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense, with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies.There's one good idea in this movie and that's how life develops as it goes along, and one action or inaction changes how life plays out. But this is no where near original, even the Simpsons had an episode like that. And this movie just goes scene after scene of how the main character jumps back in time to try to change the future.

Even yes, you may fix one thing but causing rippling side effects to others like a chain reaction. The possibilities are unlimited. Just like the ride of birth to death, it's unpredictable. This is what the film all about. The ButterFly Effect is dedicated to the Chaos Theory:&quot;It has been said that something as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world.&quot;About the film, the storyline is very interesting, you may have no idea of what the ending should be. The casting is amazingly done, three sets of the leading characters in 7 years old, 13 years old, and 21 yeasr old, are all look-alike appearance and very convincing. When this film was out in theatrical release, I missed it because of quite few negative critics. So I waited for the DVD out, and it became a well-spent twenty dollars to my DVD collection. This film is superb.The DVD comes with two film versions: a theatrical release and a director's cut. I strongly recommend that you should watch the director's cut version. It's a bit longer but it fills up lots of gaps & details you don't want to miss. There's also a couple of alternative endings, simply choose the one that make you feel better. Personally, I find the director's cut ending is stronger and more appealing but may not be commerically accepted in general. In addition to the standard features such as director's commentary, visual effects, theatrical trailer, etc., it comes with two bonus documentary: &quot;The Science and Psychology of The Chaos Theory&quot; and &quot;The History and Allure of Time Travel&quot;.

Doesn't follow the rules that establishes at the beggining, the acting is wooden, and overall seems rushed.  If you look at the ""behind the scenes"" featurette, you can understand that the two young directors have energy, but don't seem very, how to say it, intellectual in their approach to cinema.This movie is about sadism and violence in general.  How people act against each other, and the results of their actions.  In this sense, ""The Butterfly Effect"" work as an indictment of the cowboy syndrome.

This is generally not a good way to go about seeing a movie because either one's hopes are too high or one wants to dislike it just so that everyone can stop talking about it.But I liked it.  It's a pretty tight psychological thriller, involving a pretty typical storyline about alterations to the past causing the future to to turn out in ""unexpected ways""... rarely ever the way the protagonist really wants it to be. ""I'll make everything perfect!"" he decrees.Ashton Kutcher is an interesting actor.  I think he's a lot like Keira Knightley: both of them CAN act, it's just that if the director doesn't tell them to they won't.  However, this movie shows Kutcher's one-up to Knightley in that he actually did act in this one, and Knightley has yet to fully embrace a role (but I haven't seen all of her movies, so who knows on that part).Anyway, I think the biggest thing that prevented me from giving this movie a higher score is the way the children are presented.  I know that children can be damaged, and can do extreme and horrific things, but oftentimes I have a hard time accepting a movie where they find each other and end up the whole group of them hurting each other.  It's hard to explain, but it's the same reason why I don't really accept a lot of the contemporary cop dramas... there seems a need in those to get some mentally damaged woman with a completely differently mentally damaged man, and then work out this intricate plot involving how their mental problems cause this huge crime but also hide it in layers of mental instability.  Same thing here, I find it pretty difficult to accept four kids from three different families all with their completely separate lives coming together to create specific incident which one just happens to be able to twist around.  More than making the story unbelievable, it's a matter of making it seem as if everybody out there is some insane psychopath ready to explode in the right situation...  when actually psychopaths are generally kind of rare.--PolarisDiB",4,Good,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,2243,"['being', 'recommended', 'movie', 'three', 'different', 'Internet', 'recommendation', 'engines', 'being', 'told', 'see', 'good', 'friend', 'having', 'dozen', 'other', 'people', 'mention', 'figured', 'had', 'get', 'seeing', 'generally', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'go', 'seeing', 'movie', 'one', 'hopes', 'are', 'too', 'high', 'one', 'dislike', 'just', 'so', 'everyone', 'can', 'stop', 'talking', 'it.But', 'liked', 'pretty', 'tight', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'involving', 'pretty', 'typical', 'storyline', 'alterations', 'past', 'causing', 'future', 'turn', 'out', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'rarely', 'ever', 'way', 'protagonist', 'really', 'be', ""'ll"", 'make', 'everything', 'perfect', 'Kutcher', 'interesting', 'actor', 'think', 'lot', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'CAN', 'act', 'just', 'director', ""n't"", 'tell', 'wo', ""n't"", 'However', 'movie', 'Kutcher', 'one-up', 'Knightley', 'actually', 'did', 'act', 'one', 'Knightley', 'yet', 'fully', 'embrace', 'role', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movies', 'who', 'part', '.Anyway', 'think', 'biggest', 'thing', 'prevented', 'giving', 'movie', 'higher', 'score', 'way', 'children', 'are', 'presented', 'know', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'damaged', 'can', 'do', 'extreme', 'horrific', 'things', 'oftentimes', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'accepting', 'movie', 'where', 'find', 'other', 'end', 'up', 'whole', 'group', 'hurting', 'other', 'hard', 'explain', 'same', 'reason', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'accept', 'lot', 'contemporary', 'cop', 'dramas', 'there', 'need', 'get', 'mentally', 'damaged', 'woman', 'completely', 'differently', 'mentally', 'damaged', 'man', 'then', 'work', 'out', 'intricate', 'plot', 'involving', 'how', 'mental', 'problems', 'cause', 'huge', 'crime', 'also', 'hide', 'layers', 'mental', 'instability', 'Same', 'thing', 'here', 'find', 'pretty', 'difficult', 'accept', 'four', 'kids', 'three', 'different', 'families', 'completely', 'separate', 'lives', 'coming', 'together', 'create', 'specific', 'incident', 'one', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'twist', 'around', 'More', 'making', 'story', 'unbelievable', 'matter', 'making', 'seem', 'everybody', 'insane', 'psychopath', 'ready', 'explode', 'right', 'situation', 'when', 'actually', 'psychopaths', 'are', 'generally', 'kind', 'rare.', 'PolarisDiB']",N/A

Who wouldn't want to go back and be a part of history in the making or altering those situations that led to the more horrific events of the past?Ashton Kutcher stars as a young man that makes several life-changing ""treks"" to his past, only to discover that each one brings about an ""alteration"" more devastating than the next. As each journey brings about unwanted circumstances, Kutcher's ""Evan Treborn"" becomes more and more determined to right each wrong, thus creating a totally seductive viewing experience for the viewer.In all honesty, I didn't expect much in the acting department from the star of ""That 70's Show"". I was pleasantly surprised to discover Kutcher the actor as opposed to the ""star/boy toy"" of tabloid fame. He is actually quite good and carries the film quite well.

However, even that one seems rushed and imperfect.  They should have ended up with everything fixed and not even having to wait 8 years for the two leads to hook up.  The writer/directors saying that the film simply wasn't heading in that direction and it wouldn't be right to end it happily is nonsense.  The characters and the audience have just been through hell.  There is absolutely no way that Kutcher's character would put up with a life without her, or his own nonexistence, for that matter.  O.k., he was gang raped in one reality and an amputee in another, but it was his love for her that motivated him to keep trying.  Since they wrote the Director's Cut Ending in the original script, the writer/directors obviously thought his love for her was enough to warrant killing himself.  But come on, if there are an infinite number of possible outcomes, then there's no point in stopping until it's all satisfactory.  The downer endings might look good on paper, but they play like arse on screen.  Of the two versions included on the DVD, the Theatrical Version is the better one, not because it's less depressing (though it is), but simply because it's more consistent with his character and the journey he's made...and hey, that missed-look is classic.  His mother also looks too young in the Fortune Teller Scene.  I thought they could possibly start making out at any moment.  The drastic solution in the other ending strikes me as rash and desperate, as if he is losing his grip.  If someone told me about it or I'd read the original script, I'd probably call it as a great idea.  But it simply doesn't feel right in practice.  Don't think I hate unhappy endings.  If the catharsis has built up to that point, tragedy is artistically beautiful.  In this case the film did not warrant a downer ending...of any sort.  The fact that they shot so many endings in the first place is a symptom that the writer/directors had lost their pulse on the film's emotional development towards the end.  If the climax/resolution is not completely and obviously right how you imagine it, then you're probably way off.  Great endings don't have ""alternatives"".  I might rip the DVD into Final Cut Pro and put the Happy Sappy on the end and burn it onto a DVD-R.  O.k., it's a little corney and rushed, but it's better than the others shot.

818265,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0001Z52RU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 3]","The Butterfly Effect (Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, 2004)Bress and Gruber, the scriptwriters for Final Destination 2, deliver their directorial debut with one of the worst casting decisions of all time, Ashton Kutcher (That 70's Show) in a dramatic role.Or so it seemed.Kutcher is actually one of the best things about this movie. Like Jamie Foxx in Any Given Sunday, an actor who's nauseatingly annoying in comedies gets put into a drama and shows that he does, in fact, have talent.The first half of the film, which despite the above doesn't feature Kutcher, is told in flashback form as we meet the main character, Evan Treborn (played variously by Kutcher, Unbreakable bit player John Patrick Amadori, and Logan Lerman of The Patriot, Riding in Cars with Boys, etc.) at three separate times in his life. He's your typical unpopular schoolkid with a very small group of friends, a similarly messed up brother and sister, Tommy (William Lee Scott/Jesse James/Cameron Bright) and Kaylee (Amy Smart/Irene Gorovaia/Sarah Widdows) Martin, and the fat kid, Lenny (Eldon Hensen/Kevin Schmidt/Jake Karese). Evan suffers from odd blackouts throughout his life, and also various other things, like the Martins' dad (played menacingly by the always-fun Eric Stoltz) being an abusive pedophile, and his own father (Callum Keith Rennie, recently in Torso, eXistenZ, and Memento) being locked up in a mental institution for suffering from the same thing Evan does.Let me make sure you understand this: the setup is fantastic. Everything is laid out perfectly for the massive payoff. Sure, a few things are a little too pat (Martin, for example, is stereotyped to the point of silliness), and it's obvious that they're setting you up for the massive payoff. But that makes it no less enjoyable.The movie, however, starts to go downhill when it snaps back to the present. It goes from being a good thriller to something of an episode of Quantum Leap. To be short, the payoff is simply not as good as the buildup was; it's as if they had this idea, worked out how to get to it, then got there and realized there was no creative energy left.Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh. Some parts of the present-day storyline work just fine. They don't leave any loose ends around. Things are still a little too pat (the stereotyping of Evan's mother during one scene is so stupid it makes Eric Stoltz's character look like something out of Sartre), especially when you get to the ending (which takes the message of a popular classic film-- to say which one would give it away-- and turns it on its head), which is way too ""man, that's the way things SHOULD have happened"" to be anything but a cheap trick. And the idea itself is extremely interesting, and could be done far better, were anyone to come up with a good way to do it (it's been done in novels and in short form, but I don't think a feature film has ever quite pulled it off).All in all, some good things, some bad things. Probably worth a rental just to marvel at the idea Ashton Kutcher really can act. Lord knows we've never seen him do it before. ** ",3,Kutcher's got the goods-- who knew?,1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,3093,"['Butterfly', 'Effect', 'Eric', 'Bress', 'J.', 'Mackye', 'Gruber', '2004', 'Bress', 'Gruber', 'scriptwriters', 'Final', 'Destination', '2', 'deliver', 'directorial', 'debut', 'one', 'worst', 'casting', 'decisions', 'time', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', '70', 'Show', 'dramatic', 'role.Or', 'seemed.Kutcher', 'actually', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'movie', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'actor', 'who', 'nauseatingly', 'annoying', 'comedies', 'put', 'drama', 'fact', 'have', 'talent.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'above', ""n't"", 'feature', 'Kutcher', 'told', 'flashback', 'form', 'meet', 'main', 'character', 'Evan', 'Treborn', 'played', 'variously', 'Kutcher', 'Unbreakable', 'bit', 'player', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Amadori', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'Patriot', 'Riding', 'Cars', 'Boys', 'etc', 'three', 'separate', 'times', 'life', 'typical', 'unpopular', 'schoolkid', 'very', 'small', 'group', 'friends', 'similarly', 'messed', 'up', 'brother', 'sister', 'Tommy', 'William', 'Lee', 'Scott/Jesse', 'James/Cameron', 'Bright', 'Kaylee', 'Amy', 'Smart/Irene', 'Gorovaia/Sarah', 'Widdows', 'Martin', 'fat', 'kid', 'Lenny', 'Eldon', 'Hensen/Kevin', 'Schmidt/Jake', 'Karese', 'Evan', 'suffers', 'odd', 'blackouts', 'life', 'also', 'various', 'other', 'things', 'Martins', 'dad', 'played', 'menacingly', 'always-fun', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'being', 'abusive', 'pedophile', 'own', 'father', 'Callum', 'Keith', 'Rennie', 'recently', 'Torso', 'eXistenZ', 'Memento', 'being', 'locked', 'up', 'mental', 'institution', 'suffering', 'same', 'thing', 'Evan', 'make', 'sure', 'understand', 'setup', 'fantastic', 'Everything', 'laid', 'out', 'perfectly', 'massive', 'payoff', 'Sure', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'pat', 'Martin', 'example', 'stereotyped', 'point', 'silliness', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'setting', 'massive', 'payoff', 'less', 'enjoyable.The', 'movie', 'however', 'go', 'downhill', 'when', 'back', 'present', 'being', 'good', 'thriller', 'something', 'episode', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'be', 'short', 'payoff', 'simply', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'buildup', 'was', 'had', 'idea', 'worked', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'then', 'got', 'there', 'realized', 'was', 'creative', 'energy', 'left.Maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'bit', 'too', 'harsh', 'parts', 'present-day', 'storyline', 'work', 'just', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'loose', 'ends', 'Things', 'are', 'still', 'little', 'too', 'pat', 'stereotyping', 'Evan', 'mother', 'one', 'scene', 'so', 'stupid', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'character', 'look', 'something', 'Sartre', 'especially', 'when', 'get', 'ending', 'message', 'popular', 'classic', 'film', 'say', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'head', 'way', 'too', 'man', 'way', 'things', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'happened', 'be', 'anything', 'cheap', 'trick', 'idea', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'far', 'better', 'were', 'anyone', 'come', 'up', 'good', 'way', 'do', 'been', 'done', 'novels', 'short', 'form', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'feature', 'film', 'ever', 'quite', 'pulled', 'off', '.All', 'good', 'things', 'bad', 'things', 'Probably', 'rental', 'just', 'marvel', 'idea', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'really', 'can', 'act', 'Lord', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'do', '**']",N/A

818267,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,B0001Z52RU,Robert J. Schneider,"[9, 10]","The first time I ever saw Ashton Kutcher was the very first episode of &quot;That '70's Show&quot;---a show that I fell in love with right away. As it went on to become one of the best sitcoms in the past ten years, I at first saw star Topher Grace as becoming the superstar of the bunch. However, as the third season began, I began to realize that Ashton Kutcher was the valedictorian. As terminally clueless, and childishly impish, stoner Michael Kelso, the former straight-A college engineering student has created one of the most memorable sitcom characters of the modern television era. His impending superstardom seemed more &amp; more destined to be. By the beginning of the year 2000, I was wondering when his first movie would come out. By the end of the year 2000, my question had been answered, though not my prayers.As Ashton's film career began with the incredibly unfunny DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?, I shook my head with disappointment at how the lowest-common-denominator mindset of Hollywood was going to drag him down along the forgotten road of Typecast Alley. I missed the few other comedies he did afterwards (TEXAS RANGERS--2001, JUST MARRIED, MY BOSS'S DAUGHTER--both 2003), but after viewing my DVD rental of THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT (2004) last week, I was disappointed no more.THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT shows the beginnings of Kutcher's hopefully-maturing career-turn as a real all-around actor. This isn't an Oscar-caliber performance, but he brings a real heart &amp; soul to his portrayal of a young man whose future seems inexorably bound to his past---a past to which he discovers he can return at any time in order to affect his present. Evan tries to fix what went wrong in his life; however, in doing so he creates unintended consequences for himself and his beloved Kayleigh (a radiant Amy Smart, showing real depth of character here).This DVD shows both the original 113-minute Theatrical Version and the full 2-hour Director's Cut. I saw only the latter version, which is said to be the superior cut. I have not yet seen the original, so I am unable to compare the two versions. I will just say for now that the Director's Cut had a similar effect on me as the incredible Adrian Lyne-directed 1991 psycho-horror flick JACOB'S LADDER (1991): both films begin as strangely perplexing, but develop a strangely hypnotic and engrossing quality as well. As much as I wondered what the *beep* was going on, I just couldn't take my eyes off the bizarre action unwinding onscreen. And then *THE ENDING*---&gt; Unexpectedly blindsiding, it pulls the previously indecipherable clues all together, and makes total sense out of senselessness, order out of chaos. Funny that the central theme of THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT *is* Chaos Theory!Although it displays some of the more unpleasant qualities of a conventional horror flick (foul-mouthed youngsters doing things they have no business in doing, cute dogs existing purely for the purpose of being sadistically put to death), there is no doubt that Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber---the co-writers and directors who had previously teamed up to write the 2002 chiller sequel FINAL DESTINATION 2---have crafted a truly original story that contains a deceptive amount of substance behind the blurry, slick style. Some people---especially kids, it seems---did not particularly like the Director's Cut ending. I say that this is the only true ending this story could have had. (It also serves my strongly-felt theory that movies like this are most decidedly not meant for kiddies.) It makes me all the more curious as to what alternative kind of ending was edited into the Theatrical Version in order to 'please' the audience (whatever it was, it sure didn't seem to please many). Well, it looks like I'll just have to purchase this loaded-with-extras DVD to find out. That's just fine with me, as the Director's Cut alone is worth the money! If you're like me and passed on seeing THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT during its theater run, take another look at it on DVD. It may just surprise you, too!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED; AGES 16 &amp; UP",5,Excellent Film---Believe It Or Not!,1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,4076,"['first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'quot', ""'70"", 'Show', 'quot', '-a', 'show', 'fell', 'love', 'right', 'away', 'went', 'become', 'one', 'best', 'sitcoms', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'first', 'saw', 'star', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'becoming', 'superstar', 'bunch', 'However', 'third', 'season', 'began', 'began', 'realize', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'was', 'valedictorian', 'terminally', 'clueless', 'childishly', 'impish', 'stoner', 'Michael', 'Kelso', 'former', 'straight-A', 'college', 'engineering', 'student', 'created', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'sitcom', 'characters', 'modern', 'television', 'era', 'impending', 'superstardom', 'seemed', 'more', 'amp', 'more', 'destined', 'be', 'beginning', 'year', '2000', 'was', 'wondering', 'when', 'first', 'movie', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'end', 'year', '2000', 'question', 'had', 'been', 'answered', 'not', 'prayers.As', 'Ashton', 'film', 'career', 'began', 'incredibly', 'unfunny', 'DUDE', 'WHERE', 'MY', 'CAR', 'shook', 'head', 'disappointment', 'how', 'lowest-common-denominator', 'mindset', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'going', 'drag', 'down', 'forgotten', 'road', 'Typecast', 'Alley', 'missed', 'few', 'other', 'comedies', 'did', 'afterwards', 'TEXAS', 'RANGERS', '2001', 'JUST', 'MARRIED', 'MY', 'BOSS', 'DAUGHTER', '2003', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'rental', 'THE', 'BUTTERFLY', 'EFFECT', '2004', 'last', 'week', 'was', 'disappointed', 'no', 'more.THE', 'BUTTERFLY', 'EFFECT', 'beginnings', 'Kutcher', 'hopefully-maturing', 'career-turn', 'real', 'all-around', 'actor', ""n't"", 'Oscar-caliber', 'performance', 'real', 'heart', 'amp', 'soul', 'portrayal', 'young', 'man', 'future', 'inexorably', 'bound', 'past', '-a', 'past', 'can', 'return', 'time', 'order', 'affect', 'present', 'Evan', 'fix', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'life', 'however', 'doing', 'so', 'unintended', 'consequences', 'beloved', 'Kayleigh', 'radiant', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'showing', 'real', 'depth', 'character', 'here', '.This', 'DVD', 'shows', 'original', '113-minute', 'Theatrical', 'Version', 'full', '2-hour', 'Director', 'Cut', 'saw', 'only', 'latter', 'version', 'said', 'be', 'superior', 'cut', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'original', 'so', 'am', 'unable', 'compare', 'two', 'versions', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'now', 'Director', 'Cut', 'had', 'similar', 'effect', 'incredible', 'Adrian', 'Lyne-directed', '1991', 'psycho-horror', 'flick', 'JACOB', 'LADDER', '1991', 'films', 'begin', 'strangely', 'perplexing', 'develop', 'strangely', 'hypnotic', 'engrossing', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'As', 'much', 'wondered', 'what', '*beep*', 'was', 'going', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'bizarre', 'action', 'unwinding', 'onscreen', 'then', '*THE', 'ENDING*', 'gt', 'Unexpectedly', 'blindsiding', 'previously', 'indecipherable', 'clues', 'together', 'total', 'sense', 'senselessness', 'order', 'chaos', 'Funny', 'central', 'theme', 'THE', 'BUTTERFLY', 'EFFECT', '*is*', 'Chaos', 'Theory', 'more', 'unpleasant', 'qualities', 'conventional', 'horror', 'flick', 'foul-mouthed', 'youngsters', 'doing', 'things', 'have', 'business', 'doing', 'cute', 'dogs', 'existing', 'purely', 'purpose', 'being', 'sadistically', 'put', 'death', 'doubt', 'Eric', 'Bress', 'J.', 'Mackye', 'Gruber', '-the', 'co-writers', 'directors', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'teamed', 'up', 'write', '2002', 'chiller', 'sequel', 'FINAL', 'DESTINATION', '2', '-have', 'crafted', 'truly', 'original', 'story', 'deceptive', 'amount', 'substance', 'blurry', 'slick', 'style', 'people', '-especially', 'kids', '-did', 'not', 'particularly', 'Director', 'Cut', 'ending', 'say', 'only', 'true', 'ending', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'also', 'strongly-felt', 'theory', 'movies', 'are', 'most', 'decidedly', 'not', 'meant', 'kiddies', 'more', 'curious', 'what', 'alternative', 'kind', 'ending', 'was', 'edited', 'Theatrical', 'Version', 'order', ""'please"", 'audience', 'was', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'please', 'many', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'purchase', 'loaded-with-extras', 'DVD', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'fine', 'Director', 'Cut', 'alone', 'money', ""'re"", 'passed', 'seeing', 'THE', 'BUTTERFLY', 'EFFECT', 'theater', 'run', 'take', 'look', 'DVD', 'may', 'just', 'surprise', 'too', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'AGES', '16', 'amp', 'UP']",N/A

All of us have played this ""what if"" game at some point in our lives, speculating about where we might be, whom we might know and what we might be doing now if even a single event in our past had played out differently.  And how many of us would be willing to return to a key moment in our past if we knew that, by doing something different, we could forever alter the path our life ended up taking?  And what if we discovered that by undoing that event we ended up altering our lives and the lives of those around us in ways we never expected?  Would we still want to do it?This is the premise for ""The Butterfly Effect,"" an effectively creepy supernatural thriller that boasts a star-making performance by Ashton Kutcher.  Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a young man in college who, since his childhood, has been suffering inexplicable blackouts at key traumatic moments in his life.  And traumatic his life has been!  His father is consigned to a mental institution, suffering from an ailment that may have been passed on to his son.  In addition, Evan is friends with a young girl, Kayley, whose father sexually abuses not only her but Evan as well.  Kayley also has a sadistic little brother named Lenny, who inspires Evan, Kayley and a neighbor friend of theirs to perform malicious pranks and even sets Evan's dog on fire.  Now that he's in college, Evan discovers he has the power to transport himself back in time to many of these key moments in his life in an attempt to rewrite history and undo the mental and psychological damage they've caused.  The trouble is that Evan finds out that changing the course of history often brings a whole host of other unforeseen and unanticipated problems right along with it.Directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber have fashioned a complex, intricate screenplay filled with plot twists that continually alter the plane of the film's reality.  The story hurtles us back and forth in time, showing us what was, what is and then what might have been without a moment's confusion, all the while making us question whether Evan isn't simply insane after all.  There are a few, perhaps inevitable, plot holes, the most glaring of which is why Evan is unable to find out how a prank he and his friends committed in their childhood turned tragically wrong (Evan blacked out during the event).  Considering the fact that the tragedy was one that became common knowledge in the small town in which Evan lived, it is highly implausible that he would have to wait till his early `20's before he finally found out what had happened.  In addition, one might question the propriety of using a topic as sensitive as pedophilia for a supernatural thriller.  Still, those are minor quibbles for a story that works remarkably well at keeping itself credible and focused despite the inherent absurdity at its core.Kutcher does an effective job carrying the film.  By not being too handsome or too heroic, Kutcher keeps Evan life-sized and interesting.  We're willing to follow him through this elaborate labyrinth because we can identify with the truths of his character.

I would not call it an scifi, its more kind of a moralic lecture. Dont wish- it might become true (die geister, die ich rief).Whatever happens in this movie happens in extreme.

I saw it in the cinema 2 times and then decided to buy the DVD. Kutcher's performance is remarkable and the story is original. It is time travelling but not physical like back to the future and Time machine, it is mental time travel.  The movie starts with Kutcher as a kid who blacks out in certain times and his mom takes him to a doctor who advises her that her son should start writing everything he does in a journal.  That would help him control/minimize black outs. The boy starts doing that and the only things he does not record in his journal is his blackouts coz he simply can not remember what happens.  He grows up and stops having blackouts.  When one day he opens one of the journals on a certain page that he blacked out in the middle of as a kid, something wierd happens. He goes back in time with his mind and suddenly he remembers.  Throughout the film he does things in his past, little little things that make huge impacts on his present. So everytime he goes back in time to fix something, the present changes drastically. So throughout the movie he is trying to fix what he has done.  There is only one problem.  Let us assume that the blackout times for him were as follows: when he was 8 then when he was 10 then when he was 12.  If the movie starts by him going back to the most recent blackout there wouldnt have been any problem.  But the movie jumps from one blackout to the other irrespective of their time of occurance. Now, if Kutcher goes back in time for the first time when he was 8, my question is: How come do the hournals stay the SAME everytime his present changes? When you watch the movie you will see it better.  In any case, that does not make the movie bad or anything, it is one of my most favourite movies!",4,The one and only mistake in this movie is..,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,1804,"['one', 'very', 'good', 'thrillers', 'have', 'seen', 'saw', 'cinema', '2', 'times', 'then', 'decided', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Kutcher', 'performance', 'remarkable', 'story', 'original', 'time', 'travelling', 'not', 'physical', 'back', 'future', 'Time', 'machine', 'mental', 'time', 'travel', 'movie', 'Kutcher', 'kid', 'who', 'out', 'certain', 'times', 'mom', 'doctor', 'who', 'son', 'should', 'start', 'writing', 'everything', 'journal', 'would', 'help', 'control/minimize', 'black', 'outs', 'boy', 'doing', 'only', 'things', 'not', 'record', 'journal', 'blackouts', 'coz', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'what', 'up', 'stops', 'having', 'blackouts', 'When', 'one', 'day', 'one', 'journals', 'certain', 'page', 'blacked', 'out', 'middle', 'kid', 'something', 'wierd', 'back', 'time', 'mind', 'suddenly', 'film', 'things', 'past', 'little', 'little', 'things', 'make', 'huge', 'impacts', 'present', 'So', 'everytime', 'back', 'time', 'fix', 'something', 'present', 'changes', 'drastically', 'So', 'movie', 'trying', 'fix', 'what', 'done', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'Let', 'assume', 'blackout', 'times', 'were', 'when', 'was', '8', 'then', 'when', 'was', '10', 'then', 'when', 'was', '12', 'movie', 'going', 'back', 'most', 'recent', 'blackout', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'problem', 'movie', 'jumps', 'one', 'blackout', 'other', 'irrespective', 'time', 'occurance', 'Now', 'Kutcher', 'back', 'time', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'was', '8', 'question', 'How', 'come', 'do', 'hournals', 'stay', 'SAME', 'everytime', 'present', 'changes', 'When', 'watch', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'better', 'case', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'bad', 'anything', 'one', 'most', 'favourite', 'movies']",N/A

And Evan's life is ripe with trauma.  He and his friends Kayleigh Miller (a showcase role for Amy Smart) and Lenny Kegan (Elden Henson) must deal with the problems from their childhood as they grow into adults.  For Evan, his problems are made worse by the fact that his father is insane and in a psychiatric hospital, and Evan has never met him.  When Evan does meet his father, his father tries to choke him and is killed, but Evan can't remember why because of a blackout.Later, while in college and free from his blackouts for over seven years, something strange happens to Evan while he is glancing through his old journals.  Spurred by this incident to try and find out more about his past, Evan visits his old friends Kayleigh and Lenny to question them.  Lenny is disturbed and still lives at home building models, and Kayleigh is working as a waitress, scarred too deep on the inside to make a better life for herself.  When Evan is informed of Kayleigh's suicide by her brutal and psychotic brother, he decides to harness the strangeness that comes from reading his journals.Evan finds he can go back, travel into his childhood, into the dead places left by his blacked out memory, and attempts to save Kayleigh in this way.  What follows is a taut and thrilling roller coaster ride in which for every fix Evan attempts, he changes the entire course of his life and the lives of his friends.  And before its too late, Evan needs to find a way to fix everyone, even if it means losing the only girl he's ever loved.Ashton Kutcher surprised me in this movie, moving from silly comedies to a serious role with a clean style and well displayed talent.  The role of Kayleigh for Amy Smart was perfect, giving her a wide variety of characterization to spiral through as Evan continues his pursuit to bring about the changes that will leave each of his friends in a better life.  Watch for Eric Stoltz as George Miller, Kayleigh's dad, in a shocking character that he performs with excellence.  More great supporting roles from Melora Walters as Evan's mom Andrea, Elden Henson as Lenny, and the perfectly done character of Thumper, played by the talented Ethan Suplee (John Q, Evolution).`The Butterfly Effect' is not an action packed thriller, but you will still be glued to your set, watching how events unfold in different and unexpected ways, adding twists now and than that will leave you changing your mind about certain characters and crossing your fingers for Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny, and Tommy.

Many reviewers complained about the unrelieved grimness of the events in the narrative, but it only goes to show that the Freudian ""return of the repressed"" repeats the grimness of the original event. Try as he may, the main character can't seem to stop (or block out) all the repurcussions of the original child abuse event. The metaphore is given filmic visual gravitas in the image of the ""perfect"" gabled house (the mailbox which perfectly models the house behind it) being blown apart violently, an unconscious acting out of violence by the kids who were damaged by the abusive father -- an image that says that families are blown apart by domestic sexual abuse, which says the ""address"" of the issue is the home where it starts.

Or was this a semi-serious attempt at that ""Simpsons"" episode in which Homer creates a time machine out of a toaster and keeps altering his universe? Guess it doesn't really matter because whatever it was, it was fairly perplexing.First, the central quasi-timetravel theme is so dense and doozy that it hogs about 1/3rd of the movie just to present itself. We are led to believe that an adolosecent possesses the mystic ability to get back into his childhood memory and restitch some key components that were too painful for him.Fine and dandy, but the screenplay with which this is told is messy and unriveting. There are scenes of ragging (bullying, hazing) that just add very little to the overall texture of the movie. There's also a scene with Kutcher waking up in the buff with no memory of the girl in his bed last night, which is followed by a walk to the communal showers from where hot women with no clothing emerge.

LOL!)The Butterfly Effect is a darkly complex, violent, and graphic psychological thriller. Despite the violence, it is strangely compelling. Ashton Kutcher does a fine job, playing the main character Evan, and carrying the movie with surprising skill. (He was an executive producer on the project.)Evan suffered from blackouts as a young boy, typically during times of great violence and/or tragedy. As a college student, he develops the ability not only to remember what happened during those blackouts, but to be present during that time line and alter what has happened. He attempts to change the past and resulting future in order to rescue his childhood friend Kaylie from what fate has dealt her. But each time he changes the past, as might be expected, the future changes in unexpected ways. Evan then becomes caught in a roller-coaster ride of present versus past as he attempts to repair and alter an unrelenting cascade of tragic events.The movie is graphic and violent. If you have triggers for abuse or violence or PTSD, you should avoid this movie, since it pretty much hit every trigger you can think of. In fact, even if you have no triggers, you may find much of the stuff uncomfortable to watch, as I did. Still, if that isn't an issue for you, or you can get past that, it is quite the psychological thriller. It truly isn't everyone's cup of tea, so I can't really recommend it.

818282,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,B0001Z52RU,Sirin,"[1, 3]","This is a fairly original movie that has several flaws but much to go for it as well. the story of Evan (Ashton Kutcher), a psychology student who discovers the ability to change events in the past, obscured by blackouts but revealed by reading his childhood journals is an entertaining, convincing plot with several interesting incarnations. Just as a butterfly flapping its wings in China is meant to set of a chain of results that leads to a hurricane in Florida, the movie explores the counterfactuals that can result from changing one event in history.Of course, this central premise (the dangers of changing history) is not original, but the movie is saved from cliche by several aspects. Firstly the ways in which the different characters are affected are complicated, varied, realistic and require some sharply changing acting. For example, the character of Tommy - warped from abuse by his paedophile father (played by Eric Stoltz) turns into, at various times, a psychopath and a born again Christian.The themes are disturbing and often taboo- e.g paedophilia and prostitution - it seems director Eric Bess wanted the movie to have a disturbing, frightening tone. Generally this works and the actors play their parts with sinister realism. This is helped by using different actors to play the main characters as children, teenagers and adults respectively. The best example is Jesse James playing the teenage Tommy with sadistic hatred. Stoltz is convincing as the twisted father and Andy Smart deals with the different situations Kayleigh, Evan's childhood friend whom he has a lifelong crush on, finds herself in with commendable chameleon skill. The main problem is Kutcher himself. He is not laughably awful as some critics described him. It is just that he frequently lapses into laughably over the top ham acting with a half silly expression on his face that threatens to drag the film into the realms of black comedy. Essentially, he is a goofy comic actor who makes a commendable but inadequate stab at a complex, serious role.I have other quibbles with the movie as well. The ending - a sort of disturbing antithesis to the message of 'It's a Wonderful Life' is pretty underwhelming and left me feeling that the central message of the film - that changing history has reckless consequences - had turned into a rather bleak and pointless message of the futility of Evan's entire life.But don't let this put you off. Many critics hated this film. It is true that minor details leave a lot to be desired. But the general tone is haunting, tense and packed with nervous energy and some good cinematography.

This really isn't a film to be judged by its acting. Sure, they may have been able to find someone a little better, but Ashton gets the job done here and that's all the movie needs.The Butterfly Effect is about the chaos theory. It is about a man who finds a way to recall his blacked-out memories from certain points in his childhood. When he was a kid, he didn't know why he kept blacking things out, so doctors suggested having him keep a journal. They suggest that he write in it everything that he does to help jog his memory if he blacks something out.The movie is entertaining with its interesting premise, and it's at least decent acting. Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart do an excellent job as Evan and Kayleigh, along with Eric Stoltz as Kayleigh's father, and Elden Henson as Lenny. Just prepare for an entertaining ride with some very neat twists in it. This is a thinking movie, and a good one at that. I think the less you know about it before you watch it, the better it will be when you watch it.The DVD has a decent amount of supplements, with one part covering the history of the chaos theory and time travel, and a fact track. The All-Access Pass features cover more behind-the-scenes details, with commentary from the filmmakers, and documentaries on ""the creative process"", which is mostly about what the directors went through for pre-production, and a ""visual effects"" documentary.

On the surface you have Ashton Kutcher and other good looking kids going from scene to scene with cool music in the background and such... which is fine for bringing in that crowd. What I really liked about the movie were the questions that it was raising about Ashton's character and what he can do: if you can go back and change your past what implications would come of it? The Butterfly Effect pulls this off almost perfectly.The movie spends a fair amount of time in the beginning establishing Evan's (Ashton) life as a youth and all of the serious problems he faced. This is some intense stuff. You really get pulled down in the mud in these scenes and get a good idea of how messed up Evan's life was and how much he had to overcome to get to Ashton's age. By then his need to change his past, along with his ability to, gets the movie started to the point. Is this beginning long and drawn out? Does it pull you too far from the direction the movie ultimately goes? No way. While it does go off on a tangent of sorts that's exactly what you need.The rest of the film deals with his jumping back and forth to his past, trying to change it for the better, and having to deal with the results. This is the meat of the movie and this is where you see the complications between dealing with a traumatic past and how much worse it can be trying to fix it. Ashton didn't get a lot of praise for his performance in this movie, which is sad. Although his face is unforgettable from his past exploits he didn't come off as That 70's Show's Kelso or the host of MTV's Punk'd in any way. He really showed his acting chops in this movie.The special effects on this movie played well with things like its time/space warping scenes. Cinematography is worth noting too. Different eras of Evan's life seem to be depicted with different lens filters and other camera tricks that give the scenes a very signature look. All in all a very solid production.Now the theatrical release has an ending different from the director's original vision. If you ask me they made a good choice with the theatrical ending. It makes more sense and it fits better in the overall theme of the movie. The alternate ending goes way out there on left field, even with the director's cut filling in little scenes that are supposed give foreshadowing for that ending. It's just a lame ending in my opinion. There are lot of people who say they prefer the alternate ending and I can only think they do because it's such a radical departure from conventional endings.Now this Blu-Ray release is actually an import and doesn't come with any special features and whatnot other than enhanced picture. As a matter of fact this release will only have the director's cut of the movie and the theatrical release is not there at all. That includes the director's ""alternate ending"". This sucks for people who want to compare between the theatrical and director's cut as they are pretty different on how they end (and believe me that makes all the difference).The Butterfly Effect is a great movie, but this Blu-Ray release isn't. No extra features. No commentary. No both versions of the movie.

818294,AL277B4AQCWBG,B0001Z52RU,Steven Reynolds,"[2, 8]","This is a bold movie but it doesn't really work.  The fundamental problem with ""The Butterfly Effect"" is that it takes the usually lighthearted time-shifting / alternate lives premise and asks it to carry the weight of a dramatic thriller involving mental illness, paedophilia, dead kids, amputations, the sexual vagaries of prison life, and an incinerated puppy.  The premise never allows you to take any of these things quite seriously, which is why it's much better suited to comedy - films like the Bill & Ted movies, ""Groundhog Day"", ""Back To The Future"", or even ""Bedazzled"".  This variation might have worked with more imaginative scripting, a spookier look, and some classier direction - something akin to ""Vanilla Sky"" or ""Donnie Darko"" - but this was clearly aimed at the mall crowd, and probably nothing could've overcome the impediment of casting the possibly bankable but irrepressibly comedic Ashton Kutcher in the lead.  It's momentarily redeemed by a bravely downbeat Director's Cut ending, which I'd be stunned to hear didn't poll better at the test screenings than the conventional, sappy theatrical alternatives included on the DVD.  If only what came before it had been more engaging, more moving and more logically consistent (how can Evan remember everything that happened in the alternate lifetimes, when by the theory of the movie, once he changes something, it didn't happen?), then we'd be able to interpret Evan's fatal decision unambiguously as a redemptive sacrifice: ""I'll gladly give my life for the happiness of the girl I love.""  But given the relentless chaos with which the lives surrounding Evan's have proceeded DESPITE everything he's done, and the unrelieved cheesy perfection of their lives after he removes himself from the equation, his decision betrays a curious strain of solipsistic nihilism: ""I am the centre of the universe, and yet it all would have been better had I never been born.""

I love him in ""That 70s Show"", and I even like ""Pun'kd"" once in a while, in which he shows off his flair for playing both an idiot and a prankster. Until ""The Butterfly Effect"", I believed that this was all he was capable of. This movie shows that this young man may not be Lawrence Olivier, but he is an able actor that will go far with his talent rather than with his choice of bedmate.That said, ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a movie that explores the idea of Chaos Theory, and how one little thing, such as the flap of a butterfly wing, can change one's fate entirely. Ashton's character is cursed with the power to change his fate, and the fate of his childhood friends. Amy Smart goes from suicidal waitress to frat girl to drug addled hooker with ease in each of these fates, and Eric Stoltz plays the child molesting daddy with eerie precision. Every performance in this movie is strong, and nothing is sacred for the film maker. We get prison rape scenes, child abuse, animal abuse, and a host of other horrible things thrown at us that other films would avoid for fear of horrifying an audience into missing the point of the actual story.So why a 4 instead of a 5?

I am glad that i held out and continued watching, this film is a sensitive, well thought-out interpretation of that timeless thought we all have from time to time, how would my life have changed if i had done something differently, at a pivotal moment?In the case of the films main character (superbly played by the actor), things start out at rock bottom, however he realises he has the power (hereditary) to change how his character behaves at pivotal moments of his life, quickly he realises things could have been much worse. We empathise very strongly with all the characters (even the sadistic Tommy) as we understand how they became the way they did. I found it beautifully haunting the transformations which the characters undergo as their histories are changed, born again christian one minute, psychotic madman the next. The director makes a very convincing argument for the nurture over nature debate.The film works on many levels. Because we have half a dozen characters playing many differing manifestations over and over again, we become familiar with, we warm to - the characters.

Mackye GruberCast:  Ashton Kutcher, Melora Walters, Amy Smart, Elden Henson, William Le Scott, John Patrick Amedori, Irene Gorovaia, Kevin Schmidt, Eric Stoltz.Running Time:  113 minutesRated R or violence, sexual content, language and brief drug use.""The Butterfly Effect"" is directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye GruberEvan's attempt at the time-travelling, life-altering thriller.  At times the film succeeds as a compelling drama, but the film is not supported by solid acting, a complete, cohesive script, and formidable direction and execution.  Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher in a fairly sedated performance), as a young boy, endured a few childhood trauma along with his three childhood friends, Kallie, Tommy, and Lenny, such as his friend's pedophile father (played eerily by Eric Stoltz). Evan has some kind of problem, however, that causes him to blackout during these traumatic, life changing events. These past events obviously effect the present as they mold the person the four children will become and it isn't always pretty.  As a psychology major, Evan is inspired to study memory patterns, and consequently, discovers his neurological knack for forcing himself to remember things. When he does, he is able to transplant himself back to that time (through the help of his journals that he kept since he was 7) and, still knowing what he knows in the present, is able to alter the past, and also the present. So, his goal is to make all of his friends' and mother's lives at least as perfect as they can be by wiping out as much of the bad stuff as he possibly can. But not everything works well on the first try. In other words, it is an opportunity to be able to ""redo"" his past. Evan is able to give everyone a second (and third, and fourth) chance at life.The main problem with ""The Butterfly Effect"" is that it doesn't transcend this level but simply thinks that it does. The chain reaction of events that result from Evan's actions may be drastic, but there is nothing unpredictable about them. He affects crucial events in his life and the result are straightforward, logical consequenced, hardly akin to stepping on an insect and changing the course of man. The writers could have used far more imagination when devising the plot. Other changes that the character makes are unconvincing, such as the notion that he could prevent the Eric Stoltz character from abusing his daughter by simply threatening him on one occasion, a scene that again misses the point. It's not a good example of little things affecting the world in big ways. It's an example of wishful thinking, plain and simple. When the scenario finally goes wrong, it happens because of the way Kutcher's character acts in the altered present, not because of the altered time-line itself.The film's first forty-five minutes are somewhat more promising. These early scenes deal with Kutcher's childhood experiences, how he blacks out whenever his life becomes too traumatic. It's an intriguing setup that would have left me wondering where the story was headed had I not already seen the trailer, where I learned that it was going to be about time travel. On a dramatic level, the movie's biggest failing is that it never follows through with the tone it sets up in the beginning. We're promised a thriller, but the movie degenerates into what can best be described as an episodic black comedy, almost a dark version of ""Bedazzled.""  Ultimately, this movie has nothing new to contribute to the time travel genre. While it tries to pass itself off as a twist on the old premise, it quickly becomes a fairly routine thriller about a man tweaking his past. I hope that the next time they decide to do such a film, they'll leave cool metaphors like butterfly effects to a script that is truly willing to deal with such concepts instead of simply pretending to.",2,The Butterfly Effect  (2004),1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,3865,"['Director', 'Eric', 'Bress', 'J.', 'Mackye', 'GruberCast', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Melora', 'Walters', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'Elden', 'Henson', 'William', 'Le', 'Scott', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Amedori', 'Irene', 'Gorovaia', 'Kevin', 'Schmidt', 'Eric', 'Stoltz.Running', 'Time', '113', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'violence', 'sexual', 'content', 'language', 'brief', 'drug', 'use', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'directors', 'Eric', 'Bress', 'J.', 'Mackye', 'GruberEvan', 'attempt', 'time-travelling', 'life-altering', 'thriller', 'times', 'film', 'compelling', 'drama', 'film', 'not', 'supported', 'solid', 'acting', 'complete', 'cohesive', 'script', 'formidable', 'direction', 'execution', 'Evan', 'Treborn', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'fairly', 'sedated', 'performance', 'young', 'boy', 'endured', 'few', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'three', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Kallie', 'Tommy', 'Lenny', 'such', 'friend', 'pedophile', 'father', 'played', 'eerily', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'Evan', 'kind', 'problem', 'however', 'blackout', 'traumatic', 'life', 'changing', 'events', 'past', 'events', 'obviously', 'effect', 'present', 'mold', 'person', 'four', 'children', 'will', 'become', ""n't"", 'always', 'pretty', 'psychology', 'major', 'Evan', 'inspired', 'study', 'memory', 'patterns', 'consequently', 'neurological', 'knack', 'forcing', 'remember', 'things', 'When', 'able', 'transplant', 'back', 'time', 'help', 'journals', 'kept', 'was', '7', 'still', 'knowing', 'what', 'present', 'able', 'alter', 'past', 'also', 'present', 'So', 'goal', 'make', 'friends', 'lives', 'least', 'as', 'perfect', 'can', 'be', 'wiping', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'bad', 'stuff', 'possibly', 'can', 'not', 'everything', 'well', 'first', 'try', 'other', 'words', 'opportunity', 'be', 'able', 'redo', 'past', 'Evan', 'able', 'give', 'everyone', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'chance', 'life.The', 'main', 'problem', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', ""n't"", 'transcend', 'level', 'simply', 'chain', 'reaction', 'events', 'result', 'Evan', 'actions', 'may', 'be', 'drastic', 'nothing', 'unpredictable', 'crucial', 'events', 'life', 'result', 'are', 'straightforward', 'logical', 'consequenced', 'hardly', 'akin', 'stepping', 'insect', 'changing', 'course', 'man', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'far', 'more', 'imagination', 'when', 'devising', 'plot', 'Other', 'changes', 'character', 'are', 'unconvincing', 'such', 'notion', 'could', 'prevent', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'character', 'abusing', 'daughter', 'simply', 'threatening', 'one', 'occasion', 'scene', 'again', 'point', 'not', 'good', 'example', 'little', 'things', 'affecting', 'world', 'big', 'ways', 'example', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'plain', 'simple', 'When', 'scenario', 'finally', 'wrong', 'way', 'Kutcher', 'character', 'altered', 'present', 'not', 'altered', 'time-line', 'itself.The', 'film', 'first', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'more', 'promising', 'early', 'scenes', 'deal', 'Kutcher', 'childhood', 'experiences', 'how', 'out', 'whenever', 'life', 'too', 'traumatic', 'intriguing', 'setup', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'wondering', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'headed', 'had', 'not', 'already', 'seen', 'trailer', 'where', 'learned', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'time', 'travel', 'dramatic', 'level', 'movie', 'biggest', 'failing', 'never', 'tone', 'up', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'promised', 'thriller', 'movie', 'what', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'episodic', 'black', 'comedy', 'almost', 'dark', 'version', 'Bedazzled', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'nothing', 'new', 'contribute', 'time', 'travel', 'genre', 'pass', 'off', 'twist', 'old', 'premise', 'quickly', 'fairly', 'routine', 'thriller', 'man', 'tweaking', 'past', 'hope', 'next', 'time', 'decide', 'do', 'film', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'cool', 'metaphors', 'butterfly', 'effects', 'script', 'truly', 'willing', 'deal', 'such', 'concepts', 'instead', 'simply', 'pretending']",N/A

It tells of a little boy who keeps on having blackouts and doesnt realize what he is doing sometimes. He is lead to unusual actions. And Kayleigh is such a very emotional character as in he movie she is through from a happy life to unhappy, being molestered and abused to succesfulness and prostitution. Movie is about all of what I have said about Kayeigh and to further extents bad teenagehood, love, lies, animal cruelty. This movie is very kalaeidoscopic and can show how the dumbest person could have such insight in some subjects. Kutchers character is like a cat and in he movie it seems he has multiple lives, changing friends, personality due to his blackouts and psychiatric problems.

(again?!) the little bits in between that he cannot remember are literally forced on him  in the flesh as he is teleported  back in time.This movie trys to be hard hitting,intelligent,visceral,deep and ponderous all at once and fails at every turn.The screen writers dont have a clue what the subject matter is here or how to translate it nor do the directors have any idea how to make these transistions from past to present work in the context of a 120 minutes worth of film.This would have worked better without the blundering of quantum physics and the possibilities of time travel.If you dont beleive me look up Stephen Hawkins and try to hold onto your sanity because this man is decades ahead of eveyone in this field and as a layman personally I have only the most basic understanding of quantum physics and The Butterfly Effect offended me as do most tv and movie renderings of such.There is only one movie that combines all the elments of this movie plus what it means in very basic terms to time travel by Hawkins definition and that movie is the BRILLIANT but overlooked and underated Donnie Darko.No doubt the makers of The Butterfly Effect watched and ripped off Darko,I mean direct scenes just lifted with no care for the source material in either capacity.If you know nothing of physics quantum or otherwise you will probally love this movie.me I was annoyed by the inept fuzzy logic of it all.By the way the kids who played the young Smart And Kutcher are WAY better than their big star leads.Acting and chemistry wise these children could have carried this movie easy

818312,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001Z52RU,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 2]","The idea of 'The Butterfly Effects' sounds unique, but actually it is a more violent and unnerving version of Ray Bradbury's 'A Sound of Thunder' (which was filmed in 2003 with the director Peter Hyams, but of which release is much delayed).  For all its overwrought script, 'The Butterfly Effect' remains intriging all through, with the time paradox idea twisted and turned countless times.Ashton Kutcher (not so bad playing a serious role) is Evan, who as a little boy experiences sudden memory losses.  Whenever it happens, something terrible has happened around him, but the boy does not remember the truths while, as the film implies, the kids and adults surrounding him know, and greatly affected by, these horrible events.[IF YOU CAN CHANGE THE PAST...] Grown-up and in college, Evan is now a brilliant student majoring in psychology.  But one day he finds he has special ability to 'go back' to the certain point of the past, and 'see' the incidents that really happened to him.  Moreover, he realizes by interfering the events, he can change the entire course of the life of him and his girlfriend Kayleigh (excellent Amy Smart).  But the more Evan interfers, the more the history gets meddled, often with a very awful result.Avid film fans would promptly point out that the central idea is a familiar one -- remember the films like 'Frequency,' 'Somewhere in Time,' 'Retroactive,' and of course, the great 'Back to the Future' trilogy.  'The Butterfly Effect,' least humorous among them, uses this time-travel concept in a way those films never did before, including the disturbing elements like murders, abusing children, prostitution, hurting animal, and so on and on.  'Donnie Darko' surely contains pretty dismal moments, but compared with this, it is a real fun movie.The story of 'The Butterfly Effect' never stops, and by refusing to give us the chance to think a moment, it gives the audiences a non-stop roller-coaster ride, which changes the fate of Evan, Kaykeigh, and the others involved Evan's life in the most unpredictable fashion.  Though the ride is never boring, too many things are crammed in the script, and with less characters and incidents the film could have been better.Finally, as to Ashton Kutcher himself.  I think he did better acting than I expected, but still I could not shake off the image of him in 'Dude, Where's My Car?' and most notably, TV series 'Punk'd.'  I can understand the opinions of some reviewers saying he is unfairly treated -- I agree -- but if he really wants to be taken seriously, he should quit the hidden camera show immediately, or at least, before they start to make a sequel.",3,(3.5 STARS) Fine Adaptaion of Bradbury's Time-Traveling Idea,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,2643,"['idea', ""'The"", 'Butterfly', 'Effects', 'sounds', 'unique', 'actually', 'more', 'violent', 'unnerving', 'version', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'A', 'Sound', 'Thunder', 'was', 'filmed', '2003', 'director', 'Peter', 'Hyams', 'release', 'much', 'delayed', 'overwrought', 'script', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'remains', 'intriging', 'time', 'paradox', 'idea', 'twisted', 'turned', 'countless', 'times.Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'playing', 'serious', 'role', 'Evan', 'who', 'little', 'boy', 'experiences', 'sudden', 'memory', 'losses', 'Whenever', 'something', 'terrible', 'happened', 'boy', 'not', 'remember', 'truths', 'while', 'film', 'implies', 'kids', 'adults', 'surrounding', 'know', 'greatly', 'affected', 'horrible', 'events', '[', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'CHANGE', 'THE', 'PAST', 'Grown-up', 'college', 'Evan', 'now', 'brilliant', 'student', 'majoring', 'psychology', 'one', 'day', 'special', 'ability', ""'go"", 'back', 'certain', 'point', 'past', ""'see"", 'incidents', 'really', 'happened', 'Moreover', 'interfering', 'events', 'can', 'change', 'entire', 'course', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'Kayleigh', 'excellent', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'more', 'Evan', 'interfers', 'more', 'history', 'meddled', 'often', 'very', 'awful', 'result.Avid', 'film', 'fans', 'would', 'promptly', 'point', 'out', 'central', 'idea', 'familiar', 'one', 'remember', 'films', ""'Frequency"", ""'Somewhere"", 'Time', ""'Retroactive"", 'course', 'great', ""'Back"", 'Future', 'trilogy', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'least', 'humorous', 'time-travel', 'concept', 'way', 'films', 'never', 'did', 'including', 'disturbing', 'elements', 'murders', 'abusing', 'children', 'prostitution', 'hurting', 'animal', 'so', 'Darko', 'surely', 'pretty', 'dismal', 'moments', 'compared', 'real', 'fun', 'movie.The', 'story', ""'The"", 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'never', 'stops', 'refusing', 'give', 'chance', 'think', 'moment', 'audiences', 'non-stop', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'fate', 'Evan', 'Kaykeigh', 'others', 'involved', 'Evan', 'life', 'most', 'unpredictable', 'fashion', 'ride', 'never', 'boring', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'crammed', 'script', 'less', 'characters', 'incidents', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.Finally', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'think', 'did', 'better', 'acting', 'expected', 'still', 'could', 'not', 'shake', 'off', 'image', ""'Dude"", 'Where', 'My', 'Car', 'most', 'notably', 'TV', 'series', ""'d"", 'can', 'understand', 'opinions', 'reviewers', 'saying', 'unfairly', 'treated', 'agree', 'really', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'should', 'quit', 'hidden', 'camera', 'show', 'immediately', 'least', 'start', 'make', 'sequel']",N/A

I thought the movie would offer something along the lines of the famous Ray Bradbury story. Boy, was I ever wrong.The movie is, well it's just a movie. But it's the first time in a long time that I actually considered walking out of the theatre. The convoluted plot begins near the end of the film, then flashbacks thirteen years before in time. Ashton Kutcher's character is a child who starts suffering from blackouts and has brain bleeding, similar to his father (who lives in a mental institution). Kutcher's character soon learns that he can travel back through time by reading journals from his youth. He has to concentrate on what he is doing and he is only able to travel back in his own life and control his former self. That doesn't really make any sense and the movie doesn't either. I guess the best way to describe it is a cross between SOMEWHERE IN TIME and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.The movie doesn't really make any sense. I heard several people say near the end of the film, &#34;I have no idea what is going on.&#34; Also, the film is such a bizarre blend, that it just left the audience confused. For instance, there were several times in the movie that were clearly meant to be serious, but not in a shocking way: several people were laughing and several people were gasping in shock. Of course, besides all the confusion, there's also the fact that the film doesn't remain true to logic. For instance, Kutcher's character goes back in time to the exact same period of his childhood at least two times. His character performs different actions all three times, which makes no sense whatsoever. As for the &#34;big questions&#34; this movie supposedly raises, it really doesn't ask any. It just appears that it does, kind of like a political candidate appearing to answer a question without really answering it.Just trying to write about the movie is confusing and is gives me a headache. I would recommend staying away from this film at all costs because it really is a waste of your time (the only things worthwhile in the film are Kutcher and Amy Smart and the eerie musical score).

Kutcher as an adult is a psychology student who can access the past through his childhood journal entries. After several violent incidents that occur during his childhood along with his friends, specifically child abuse, animal torture and a bombing dare gone wrong, Kutcher believes he can change the outcome and save the lives of his cherished friends. In a film that twists and turns and keeps your mind wondering the characters walk back and forth over time making changes and living the outcomes only to continuously be disappointed, life is never perfect no matter how hard they try.Kutcher and his gang do excellent work in this thriller with a message. This movie is suspenseful, gut wrenching and something that will cause one to ponder the source of our own childhood guilt. It will leave you questioning how much you would sacrifice to save the life of your friends.

The problem is that whenever he makes any changes, there are always disasterous and unpredictable consequences of his alteration of the past (hence the relationship to &quot;chaos theory&quot; and the term &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, i.e., a butterfly taking flight can have a dynamic effect on weather conditions making complete prediction impossible).The film's dark vision doesn't make this light entertainment. Still, it's a very interesting and well made film that challenges the viewer's preconceptions. The kids cast in the film give strong, convincing performances. Ashton Kutcher does a solid job in his role as Evan &quot;the time traveler&quot; but he doesn't always have the dramatic depth to communicate everything he could. Still, he does an exceptional job with the skills he has to work with. He's proven that he can carry more than a comedy picture.  Amy Smart, in particularly, plays a variation on the same character many, many times with major differences depending upon how the timeline was altered.I personally preferred the original theatrical ending. Why? Because creating hope out of hopelessness is an essential part of our humanity. The nilistic director's cut doesn't add anything and makes the character's sense of discovery worthless if there's no dramatic payoff that the audience can buy into.The infinifilm features on the DVD allow you to watch short commentaries,a breakdown of visual effects, alternate takes,storyboards, deleted scenes with and without commentary then return immediately to the film. While it doesn't provide as much depth as a series of featurettes (or director's commentaries), it provides a thumbnail sketch of how the film took shape.I'd be curious to hear the writers/directors take on the original ending vs. the theatrical cut. I won't say anything about the two except that one is more hopeful while the other is very, very dark. The latter ending made the film less pleasant for me. Sometimes the audience is right about the film and the artist wrong. In this case, I'd have to argue for watching the theatrical cut first and using the infinifilm feature to view the alternate, original ending of the film. It's the best way to gage them and compare them.The DVD picture quality is pretty good overall on this dual sided single layer disc. The sound quality was a bit problematic at times as the version I purchased had some problems with distortion (which has become more and more of a problem with DVDs now that more of them are being pressed). My only complaint (a minor one at that) is that there isn't a director's commentary track.&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; isn't a perfect thriller but it doesn't need to be; the questions it raises and the genuine suspense created by not knowing the outcome of each change in the past makes it an enjoyable film to watch. Yes, there's a lot of dark stuff that happens shaping the events in the lives of these kids but it that is the essence good drama.",4,&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; takes flight,1089244800,"07 8, 2004",2004,3253,"['very', 'interesting', 'thriller', 'many', 'same', 'themes', 'recent', 'remake', 'quot', 'Time', 'Machine', 'quot', 'quot', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'quot', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'ability', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'essentially', 'reliving', 'memories', 'based', 'journals', 'problem', 'whenever', 'changes', 'are', 'always', 'disasterous', 'unpredictable', 'consequences', 'alteration', 'past', 'hence', 'relationship', 'quot', 'chaos', 'theory', 'quot', 'term', 'quot', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'quot', 'i.e.', 'butterfly', 'taking', 'flight', 'can', 'have', 'dynamic', 'effect', 'weather', 'conditions', 'making', 'complete', 'prediction', 'impossible', '.The', 'film', 'dark', 'vision', ""n't"", 'make', 'light', 'entertainment', 'Still', 'very', 'interesting', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'viewer', 'preconceptions', 'kids', 'cast', 'film', 'give', 'strong', 'convincing', 'performances', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'solid', 'job', 'role', 'Evan', 'quot', 'time', 'traveler', 'quot', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'dramatic', 'depth', 'communicate', 'everything', 'could', 'Still', 'exceptional', 'job', 'skills', 'work', 'proven', 'can', 'carry', 'more', 'comedy', 'picture', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'particularly', 'variation', 'same', 'character', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'major', 'differences', 'depending', 'how', 'timeline', 'was', 'altered.I', 'personally', 'preferred', 'original', 'theatrical', 'ending', 'Why', 'creating', 'hope', 'hopelessness', 'essential', 'part', 'humanity', 'nilistic', 'director', 'cut', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'character', 'sense', 'discovery', 'worthless', 'dramatic', 'payoff', 'audience', 'can', 'buy', 'into.The', 'infinifilm', 'features', 'DVD', 'allow', 'watch', 'short', 'commentaries', 'breakdown', 'visual', 'effects', 'alternate', 'storyboards', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'then', 'return', 'immediately', 'film', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'depth', 'series', 'featurettes', 'director', 'commentaries', 'thumbnail', 'sketch', 'how', 'film', 'took', 'shape.I', ""'d"", 'be', 'curious', 'hear', 'writers/directors', 'take', 'original', 'ending', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'two', 'one', 'more', 'hopeful', 'other', 'very', 'very', 'dark', 'latter', 'ending', 'made', 'film', 'less', 'pleasant', 'Sometimes', 'audience', 'right', 'film', 'artist', 'wrong', 'case', ""'d"", 'have', 'argue', 'watching', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'first', 'using', 'infinifilm', 'feature', 'view', 'alternate', 'original', 'ending', 'film', 'best', 'way', 'gage', 'compare', 'them.The', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'dual', 'sided', 'single', 'layer', 'disc', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'bit', 'problematic', 'times', 'version', 'purchased', 'had', 'problems', 'distortion', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'problem', 'DVDs', 'now', 'more', 'are', 'being', 'pressed', 'only', 'complaint', 'minor', 'one', ""n't"", 'director', 'commentary', 'track.', 'quot', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'quot', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'questions', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'created', 'not', 'knowing', 'outcome', 'change', 'past', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'watch', 'Yes', 'lot', 'dark', 'stuff', 'shaping', 'events', 'lives', 'kids', 'essence', 'good', 'drama']",N/A

If it wasn't him in it, I'm sure those 300 and something reviews weren't so good!",1,One Of The Worst Films I had Ever Seen!,1110585600,"03 12, 2005",2005,438,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'friends', 'told', 'great', 'movie', 'watched', 'damn', 'movie', 'HORRIBLE', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'years', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'horrible', 'movie', 'tasteless-trying', 'be', 'sophisticated', 'script', 'Please', 'did', ""n't"", 'fooled', 'just', 'bored', 'reason', 'movie', 'became', 'hit', 'only', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'sure', '300', 'something', 'reviews', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'good']",N/A

Do you like to really think about the repercussions of the actions transpiring on screen?  If you answered ""Yes"" to both of those questions, then ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a movie for you!For a basic plot summary, ""Butterfly Effect"" tells the story of the rather unique Evan (Ashton Kutcher), who as a child begins to experience strange blackouts that frighten mother Andrea (Melora Walters), whose husband had a history of similar experiences.  As Evan begins to age, he discovers that his blackouts all revolve around a series of traumatic memories spent with childhood acquaintances Kayleigh (Amy Smart), Lenny (Elden Henson), and Tommy (William Lee Scott).  I wish I could delve more into this wonderful film, but to do so would give away too many spoilers and ruin the experience.There are two things to know about this movie right off the bat:1. Do not be scared away by Kutcher.  No, he is not God's gift to thespians, but this isn't goofy Kelso here.  He plays a very good role.2. Do not give up after the first 30-40, which will seem rather random and disjointed.  If you can give the movie at least an hour, you will be hooked.This is very much a ""thinking person's"" movie at its core.  It deals with relativistic physics and the like.  If that is not your cup of tea, then don't bother.  If you love to be challenged by your theatrical fare, though, then this one will astound you!",5,Do You Like To Think While Watching?,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,1446,"['Do', 'like', 'be', 'challenged', 'watching', 'movie', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'repercussions', 'actions', 'transpiring', 'screen', 'answered', 'Yes', 'questions', 'then', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'movie', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'story', 'rather', 'unique', 'Evan', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'who', 'child', 'experience', 'strange', 'blackouts', 'frighten', 'mother', 'Andrea', 'Melora', 'Walters', 'husband', 'had', 'history', 'similar', 'experiences', 'Evan', 'age', 'blackouts', 'revolve', 'series', 'traumatic', 'memories', 'spent', 'childhood', 'acquaintances', 'Kayleigh', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'Lenny', 'Elden', 'Henson', 'Tommy', 'William', 'Lee', 'Scott', 'wish', 'could', 'delve', 'more', 'wonderful', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'ruin', 'experience.There', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'know', 'movie', 'right', 'bat:1', 'Do', 'not', 'be', 'scared', 'away', 'Kutcher', 'No', 'not', 'God', 'gift', 'thespians', ""n't"", 'goofy', 'Kelso', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'role.2', 'Do', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'first', '30-40', 'will', 'seem', 'rather', 'random', 'disjointed', 'can', 'give', 'movie', 'least', 'hour', 'will', 'be', 'hooked.This', 'very', 'much', 'thinking', 'person', 'movie', 'core', 'relativistic', 'physics', 'like', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'love', 'be', 'challenged', 'theatrical', 'fare', 'though', 'then', 'one', 'will', 'astound']",N/A
