802563,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B0001EFV9K,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[2, 2]","After reviewing Saved by the Bell back in August, I couldn't get the silly theme song out of my head. I used a $15.00 coupon code given to me by Mommy Bear Media (where you can find family-friendly movies and television series) along with my own money to buy Saved by the Bell Seasons Three & Four. I also bought the Saved by the Bell: Double Feature Two Movies set that features the two made-for-television movies, Hawaiian Style and Wedding in Las Vegas.I was hooked on Saved by the Bell when I was a kid, but I think every kid in the early 90s watching it. The first & second DVD set went by the syndication order and not the original airdate. The episode order in the season 3 & 4 is worse than the previous. Yes, Lionsgate once again went by the syndication order, but there are a few two part episodes that have another episode in between them. The episodes at the summer resort are randomly mixed in with the Bayside High episodes for discs 1-3. The continuity error doesn't bother me too much, but it could become a problem for any new fan of the series.The series actually aired for four seasons, but the production filmed five different batches, aka five seasons.The episodes are:Disc One - The Famous Belding Boys; Breaking Up is Hard to Do; The Glee Club; The Last Dance; Zack's Birthday Party; The AftermathDisc Two - The Game; Operation Zack; Fourth of July; Wicked Stepbrother part 1; Wicked Stepbrother part 2; Check Your MateDisc Three - My Boyfriend's Back; Fake IDs; Boss Lady; Pipe Dreams; The Last Weekend; Date Auction; All in the MallDisc Four - S.A.T.'s; Palm Springs Weekend Part 1; Hold Me Tight; Palm Springs Weekend Part 2; No Hope With Dope; Rockumentary; Cut Day; Home for Christmas Part 1; Home for Christmas Part 2; Mystery WeekendMajor highlights during the season are the breakup of Zack and Kelly, the breakup of Slater and Jesse, the six summer episodes at the resort, and the two-part Palm Springs episodes. The plots are better in seasons 3 & 4, though Screech becomes less of a nerd and more of a goofball sidekick. My favorite is the two-part Christmas episode that use to air on TBS every holiday season up until a few years ago. Despite the order errors, I enjoyed watching the DVD set.",4,A Childhood Favorite,1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,2228,"['reviewing', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'back', 'August', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'silly', 'theme', 'song', 'head', 'used', '15.00', 'coupon', 'code', 'given', 'Mommy', 'Bear', 'Media', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'family-friendly', 'movies', 'television', 'series', 'own', 'money', 'buy', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'Seasons', 'Three', 'Four', 'also', 'bought', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'Double', 'Feature', 'Two', 'Movies', 'set', 'two', 'made-for-television', 'movies', 'Hawaiian', 'Style', 'Wedding', 'Las', 'Vegas.I', 'was', 'hooked', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'think', 'kid', 'early', '90s', 'watching', 'first', 'second', 'DVD', 'set', 'went', 'syndication', 'order', 'not', 'original', 'airdate', 'episode', 'order', 'season', '3', '4', 'worse', 'previous', 'Yes', 'Lionsgate', 'once', 'again', 'went', 'syndication', 'order', 'are', 'few', 'two', 'part', 'episodes', 'have', 'episode', 'episodes', 'summer', 'resort', 'are', 'randomly', 'mixed', 'Bayside', 'High', 'episodes', 'discs', '1-3', 'continuity', 'error', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'could', 'become', 'problem', 'new', 'fan', 'series.The', 'series', 'actually', 'aired', 'four', 'seasons', 'production', 'filmed', 'five', 'different', 'batches', 'aka', 'five', 'seasons.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'Disc', 'One', 'Famous', 'Belding', 'Boys', 'Breaking', 'Up', 'Hard', 'Do', 'Glee', 'Club', 'Last', 'Dance', 'Zack', 'Birthday', 'Party', 'AftermathDisc', 'Two', 'Game', 'Operation', 'Zack', 'Fourth', 'July', 'Wicked', 'Stepbrother', 'part', '1', 'Wicked', 'Stepbrother', 'part', '2', 'Check', 'MateDisc', 'Three', 'Boyfriend', 'Back', 'Fake', 'IDs', 'Boss', 'Lady', 'Pipe', 'Dreams', 'Last', 'Weekend', 'Date', 'Auction', 'All', 'MallDisc', 'Four', 'S.A.T', 'Palm', 'Springs', 'Weekend', 'Part', '1', 'Hold', 'Me', 'Tight', 'Palm', 'Springs', 'Weekend', 'Part', '2', 'Hope', 'Dope', 'Rockumentary', 'Cut', 'Day', 'Home', 'Christmas', 'Part', '1', 'Home', 'Christmas', 'Part', '2', 'Mystery', 'WeekendMajor', 'highlights', 'season', 'are', 'breakup', 'Zack', 'Kelly', 'breakup', 'Slater', 'Jesse', 'six', 'summer', 'episodes', 'resort', 'two-part', 'Palm', 'Springs', 'plots', 'are', 'better', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'though', 'Screech', 'less', 'nerd', 'more', 'goofball', 'sidekick', 'favorite', 'two-part', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'use', 'air', 'TBS', 'holiday', 'season', 'up', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'order', 'errors', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'DVD', 'set']",Saved by the Bell - Seasons 3 & 4

802568,A1PL872BEASABJ,B0001EFV9K,Ham Sammich,"[3, 3]","After being very disappointed with the 1st and 2nd season's DVD boxed sets, I purchased season 3 and 4 for mostly archival purposes.  I am in a constant state of paranoid fear that someday TBS will stop showing Saved By the Bell in syndication, so the fact that these boxed sets are available at all is reason enough for me to buy them.The absence of special features, coupled with the shoddy packaging of the first boxed set made me very angry, despite the relatively low price of the set for two seasons.  I, as had many other fans, vented my rage on Amazon.com...and Lion's Gate or NBC Entertainment (or what have you) listened!!  And good for them.However, there is still quite a bit of room for improvement.  The packaging still leaves much to be desired.  Although the cardboard is more substantial, it is still a funky fold-out without an outer box.  I commend them on their decision to put any stickers on the outside of the shrink wrap so that upon removal, the cardboard does not rip.  Cool beans.The back cover boasts commentary from cast members and this is somewhat misleading.  Commentary is found on only a few episodes by some combination of the following: Peter Engel (producer), Dennis Haskins (Mr. Belding), Lark Voorhies (Lisa Turtle), and Dustin Diamond (if you don't know, I'm not going to tell you).  The commentaries that exclusively feature by Peter Engel are unlistenable.  He sounds like a retarded old man reading a prepared statement.  Those commentaries that feature the actors, however, are well worth the price of admission.  On one episode, Dustin Diamond does the commentary solo and the result is pure brilliance.  His attitude toward being a formerchildstar is as healthy as I've ever seen-such an attitude translates well to episode commentary.  He's loose, he's witty, he's Sceech.Always frustrating, of course, is the order of the episodes.  I'm still very confused about what happened when and who the hell Tori is.  The ""Malibu Sands"" episodes are all out of order, spliced by other episodes that take place at the school-so confusing.And let me let you in on a funny little secret (I have to give my husband full credit for spotting this).  In one of the pictures of the cast on the box, there is a picture with all the kids and Mr. Belding.  That picture is actually from the ""No Hope With Dope"" episode, which featured then-NBC president Brandon Tartikoff.  Mr. Belding's head was photo-shopped on to Brandon Tartikoff's body.  It's really corny.Overall, it was a good second try.  Hopefully, the third time will be the charm.  I really look forward to getting explanations for certain issues that have plagued me and so many others of my generation since seventh grade.  In the first Tori episode, why does Slater dance with a tree?  Is there any transition whatsoever between the Jessie/Kelly and the Tori episodes that I somehow missed?  WHO IS TORI???",4,It's Alright...,1083801600,"05 6, 2004",2004,2899,"['being', 'very', 'disappointed', '1st', '2nd', 'season', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'sets', 'purchased', 'season', '3', '4', 'mostly', 'archival', 'purposes', 'am', 'constant', 'state', 'paranoid', 'fear', 'someday', 'TBS', 'will', 'stop', 'showing', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'syndication', 'fact', 'boxed', 'sets', 'are', 'available', 'reason', 'enough', 'buy', 'them.The', 'absence', 'special', 'features', 'coupled', 'shoddy', 'packaging', 'first', 'boxed', 'set', 'made', 'very', 'angry', 'relatively', 'low', 'price', 'set', 'two', 'seasons', 'had', 'many', 'other', 'fans', 'vented', 'rage', 'Amazon.com', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'NBC', 'Entertainment', 'what', 'have', 'listened', 'good', 'them.However', 'still', 'quite', 'bit', 'room', 'improvement', 'packaging', 'still', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'cardboard', 'more', 'substantial', 'still', 'funky', 'fold-out', 'outer', 'box', 'commend', 'decision', 'put', 'stickers', 'outside', 'shrink', 'wrap', 'upon', 'removal', 'cardboard', 'not', 'rip', 'Cool', 'beans.The', 'back', 'cover', 'boasts', 'commentary', 'cast', 'members', 'somewhat', 'misleading', 'Commentary', 'found', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'combination', 'following', 'Peter', 'Engel', 'producer', 'Dennis', 'Haskins', 'Mr.', 'Belding', 'Lark', 'Voorhies', 'Lisa', 'Turtle', 'Dustin', 'Diamond', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'commentaries', 'exclusively', 'feature', 'Peter', 'Engel', 'are', 'unlistenable', 'retarded', 'old', 'man', 'reading', 'prepared', 'statement', 'commentaries', 'feature', 'actors', 'however', 'are', 'well', 'price', 'admission', 'one', 'episode', 'Dustin', 'Diamond', 'commentary', 'solo', 'result', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'attitude', 'being', 'formerchildstar', 'as', 'healthy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen-such', 'attitude', 'well', 'episode', 'commentary', 'loose', 'witty', 'Sceech.Always', 'frustrating', 'course', 'order', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'still', 'very', 'confused', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'who', 'hell', 'Tori', 'Malibu', 'Sands', 'episodes', 'are', 'order', 'spliced', 'other', 'episodes', 'take', 'place', 'school-so', 'confusing.And', 'let', 'let', 'funny', 'little', 'secret', 'have', 'give', 'husband', 'full', 'credit', 'spotting', 'one', 'pictures', 'cast', 'box', 'picture', 'kids', 'Mr.', 'Belding', 'picture', 'actually', 'No', 'Hope', 'Dope', 'episode', 'featured', 'then-NBC', 'president', 'Brandon', 'Tartikoff', 'Mr.', 'Belding', 'head', 'was', 'photo-shopped', 'Brandon', 'Tartikoff', 'body', 'really', 'corny.Overall', 'was', 'good', 'second', 'try', 'Hopefully', 'third', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'charm', 'really', 'look', 'forward', 'getting', 'explanations', 'certain', 'issues', 'have', 'plagued', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'generation', 'seventh', 'grade', 'first', 'Tori', 'episode', 'why', 'Slater', 'dance', 'tree', 'there', 'transition', 'whatsoever', 'Jessie/Kelly', 'Tori', 'somehow', 'missed', 'WHO', 'TORI']",Saved by the Bell - Seasons 3 & 4

It defined my Saturday mornings: this, along with The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.I bought this season first because it had more of my favorite episodes on it.This show isn't just a sitcom. It is a cult classic. They were able to make the show appealing for both young kids and adults.As I watch Saved by the Bell as an adult, I pick up on some disturbing things that eluded me before: one, the gang is really mean to the nerds (""school intellectuals""), or anyone who doesn't fit their ""cool"" status. It reminds me of real-life school cliques and elitists who ostracize the unpopular kids. These kids grow up to become mass murderers much of the time. Better watch out! You might be on somebody's ""list."" The Saved by the Bell clique were basically good people, but boy did they have their moments of cruelty and deviousness.One other complaint I have is with the breakdown of the episodes. This is more of NBC's fault than it is Lions Gate.

(played by Mario Lopez), who struggles to please in the gift wrapping department.  Jessie (played by Elizabeth Berkley) struggles with onery brats as Santa's Helper.  (Santa Claus plays &#34;himself.&#34;  Zack (played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar) plays Santa, too.)  Kelly (played by Tiffani-Amber Thiessen) also works at Mr. Moody's retail store, and befriends Laura.Zack bumps into Laura (played by Jennifer McComb) at the mall, and starts flirting with her immediately.  They start dating, and he eventually wins her heart.Coincidentally, Zack and his friends are putting on a theatrical version of Charles Dickens' classic, A Christmas Carol, in the mall, so he, of course, wants Laura to participate.  Unfortunately, Mr. Moody, a modern Scrooge, refuses to give Laura the time off, and he also refuses to give her an advance on her wages so she can purchase a much-needed coat.To make matters worse, Laura's father (played by Stephen Mendel) passes out at the mall due to starvation.  Luckily, Zack and A.C. rescue him, and he is hospitalized.  (ObamaCare wasn't in effect yet, and the benefits of Reaganomics were still &#34;kicking&#34; during George H.W. Bush's Presidency, before the dope-smoking, draft-dodging sex offender, Bill Clinton, had a chance to destroy the U.S. housing market and economy, so even homeless people could get medical care.)Will Laura get to see, let alone perform in her new boy friend's Christmas Carol?
