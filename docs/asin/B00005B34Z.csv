Even better, of course, would be to actually take them to see it performed if you can find it in your area, but this will do.My children were already familiar with, and love, the ballet but this is by far their favorite.  The storyline is spoken so they do not have to interrupt your concentration asking you to explain what is going on (another thing that makes it ideal for a first ballet outing) and the story is one that any child can love.I have three boys and all of them ask to watch this over and over.As for whether or not it should even be a ballet, let the purists fume.  In my opinion this is a non-issue (and I'm somewhat a purist myself).",4,Introduce your children to the ballet,1127606400,"09 25, 2005",2005,814,"['kids', 'have', 'knowledge', 'ballet', 'think', 'probably', 'boring', 'schoolmates', 'tell', 'great', 'DVD', 'start', 'Even', 'better', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'actually', 'take', 'see', 'performed', 'can', 'find', 'area', 'will', 'do.My', 'children', 'were', 'already', 'familiar', 'love', 'ballet', 'far', 'favorite', 'storyline', 'spoken', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'interrupt', 'concentration', 'asking', 'explain', 'what', 'going', 'thing', 'ideal', 'first', 'ballet', 'outing', 'story', 'one', 'child', 'can', 'love.I', 'have', 'three', 'boys', 'ask', 'watch', 'over', 'over.As', 'not', 'should', 'even', 'be', 'ballet', 'let', 'purists', 'fume', 'opinion', 'non-issue', ""'m"", 'somewhat', 'purist']",Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf / Royal Ballet School

Bell ""Imzadi""","[30, 30]","I bought three copies of this DVD, one for myself, one for my 8-year-old granddaughter, and one for a friend's daughters, ages 11, 9, and 6.  All of us, including my friend and his wife, loved it.  It is the perfect length for children who are being introduced to ballet.  The costumes are beautiful and colorful, and, of course, the music is outstanding.  The students dance very well.  At the price, it's a bargain.  Buy this video &amp; enjoy it with your young ones.  Even boys would like this one!",5,Little Girls Love This Ballet,1049328000,"04 3, 2003",2003,502,"['bought', 'three', 'copies', 'DVD', 'one', 'one', '8-year-old', 'granddaughter', 'one', 'friend', 'daughters', '11', '9', '6', 'including', 'friend', 'wife', 'loved', 'perfect', 'length', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'introduced', 'ballet', 'costumes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'colorful', 'course', 'music', 'outstanding', 'students', 'dance', 'very', 'well', 'price', 'bargain', 'Buy', 'video', 'amp', 'enjoy', 'young', 'ones', 'Even', 'would', 'like', 'one']",Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf / Royal Ballet School

Lichlyter ""Colorado Gran""","[2, 2]","I learned the Prokofiev work as a child (long ago) as a way of getting to know the various instruments of the orchestra - and, of course, I'd seen the Disney version.  So I knew the music and the story.  When I came across this ballet interpretation, I thought my granddaughters might or not be interested - it was worth a try.  Was I surprised!  When they visit, PETER always comes out and the girls love it.  If I had grandsons, I would try it with them as well, since the boys' dancing is interesting and not ""girly.""  At first I had to explain why the actors did not speak - that they were telling the story by dancing - and then they were sold on it.Yes, there are some close-up cuts, but a previous reviewer was certainly correct in saying that youngsters benefit from seeing the characters up close.  Every time I watch it, I find something I didn't see before.  Some of the ""business"" is charming, and it will get past you if you think you already know what is happening at a given moment.  For instance, look for the spot at which the wolf has eaten the duck (I'm not really giving anything away here) and the sad ensemble is exiting past him; one of them bumps him deliberately and he snarls.  Facial expressions are wonderful!I'm quite impressed with the quality of the production, and I've discovered that some of the young dancers have gone on to fine careers.The problem with this dvd right now is that it is difficult to find!

580212,A1JEFESGLIS076,B00005B34Z,rsoonsa,"[5, 5]","The enduringly popular work by Sergei Prokofiev is adapted here with admirable aesthetic cohesion by 24 year old choreographer Matthew Hart, and performed by dancers in training with the Royal Ballet, as the Company's Director, Sir Anthony Dowell, one of the very finest artists with the Royal during the last half of the twentieth century, serves as narrator and as the cast's Grandfather in an engaging performance recorded at Covent Garden.  Staging is uncomplicated and is distinguished by effective lighting, each craft increasing the impact of Hart's able use of engraved line for the young dancers, designed to capture the attention of an equally young audience, and Prokofiev's orchestral colour is aptly appropriated, with its varied descriptive moods conveyed by Hart for the purposes of dance.  The composer's score provides but a limited number of conceivable balletic roles: Peter, his Grandfather, the Wolf, Bird, Cat, and Duck, yet Hart in a master stroke has deployed small groups of dancers to embody abstractions of a forest, a meadow, a wall, and a pond, while Royal Ballet Junior School boys are depicted as bespectacled huntsmen.  These latter exhibit the only ragged dancing in the film, while Martin Harvey, one year into the Upper School, displays a good deal of fluency, thereby tendering the work's central performance as the Wolf, while Dowell, completing dilatory enveloping arabesques with a walking stave, creates a correctly personal interpretation in his role as Peter's Grandfather in this delicious film that must certainly garner approval from viewers of all ages.  A DVD version provides no extras, but is excellent in every other manner.",5,Ballet Tailored For A Musical Showpiece.,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,1674,"['enduringly', 'popular', 'work', 'Sergei', 'Prokofiev', 'adapted', 'here', 'admirable', 'aesthetic', 'cohesion', '24', 'year', 'old', 'choreographer', 'Matthew', 'Hart', 'performed', 'dancers', 'training', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'Company', 'Director', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Dowell', 'one', 'very', 'finest', 'artists', 'Royal', 'last', 'half', 'twentieth', 'century', 'narrator', 'cast', 'Grandfather', 'engaging', 'performance', 'recorded', 'Covent', 'Garden', 'Staging', 'uncomplicated', 'distinguished', 'effective', 'lighting', 'craft', 'increasing', 'impact', 'Hart', 'able', 'use', 'engraved', 'line', 'young', 'dancers', 'designed', 'capture', 'attention', 'equally', 'young', 'audience', 'Prokofiev', 'orchestral', 'colour', 'aptly', 'appropriated', 'varied', 'descriptive', 'moods', 'conveyed', 'Hart', 'purposes', 'dance', 'composer', 'score', 'limited', 'number', 'conceivable', 'balletic', 'roles', 'Peter', 'Grandfather', 'Wolf', 'Bird', 'Cat', 'Duck', 'yet', 'Hart', 'master', 'stroke', 'deployed', 'small', 'groups', 'dancers', 'embody', 'abstractions', 'forest', 'meadow', 'wall', 'pond', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'Junior', 'School', 'boys', 'are', 'depicted', 'bespectacled', 'huntsmen', 'latter', 'exhibit', 'only', 'ragged', 'dancing', 'film', 'Martin', 'Harvey', 'one', 'year', 'Upper', 'School', 'good', 'deal', 'fluency', 'thereby', 'tendering', 'work', 'central', 'performance', 'Wolf', 'Dowell', 'completing', 'dilatory', 'enveloping', 'arabesques', 'walking', 'stave', 'correctly', 'personal', 'interpretation', 'role', 'Peter', 'Grandfather', 'delicious', 'film', 'must', 'certainly', 'garner', 'approval', 'viewers', 'ages', 'DVD', 'version', 'extras', 'excellent', 'other', 'manner']",Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf / Royal Ballet School
