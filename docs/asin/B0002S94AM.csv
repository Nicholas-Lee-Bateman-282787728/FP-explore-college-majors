844508,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0002S94AM,Grady Harp,"[5, 6]","SLIPPING DOWN LIFE is obviously a work of love - a low budget film that won recognition in the Sundance Festival in 1999 but wasn't  released until 2004.  Adapted from Anne Tyler's novel by the same name, director Toni Kalem has carefully recreated the shabby little North Carolina town of the early 1960s and directs her actors in a way that convinces us of the rural mentality that drove so many young people to follow the piper of Rock and Roll, merely to escape the doldrums of their corralled future.Evie Decker (Lili Taylor in yet another finely tuned portrayal of a young women on the verge of self extinction) is a plain, bored, young lass living with her father (Tom Bowers), her mother having died at childbirth.  She  works in a kiddie amusement park inside the costume of a silly rabbit.  Her view of the world and her role in it is bleak, to say the least.  Her only friend is Violet (a fine cameo by Sara Rue) who is an overweight hairdresser and the two of them attend a local concert of rock and roll music, discovering the strangely hypnotic, idiosyncratic singer Drumstrings Casey (Guy Pearce, always extending his repertoire of character types from 'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert' to 'LA Confidential' to 'Memento', etc).Drum's sidekick David (John Hawkins) will go to any extreme to publicize his partner's singing career, and when Evie falls under Drum's spell, she 'competes' with all the tawdry tramps vying for Drum's sexual favors by carving ""Casey"" on her forehead.  This act not only serves as an awakening of Evie's spirit, but also gives David a thought for publicity: Evie with her carved forehead will be present at all of Drum's concerts as a trademark of fan devotion!The now awakened Evie eventually draws Drum out of his cocoon and they eventually marry, only to encounter the realities of commitment.  The scenario ends is a most tender fashion that remains best withheld from the viewer.This film, while very fine in its capturing a time and era and atmosphere so prevalent in the turbulent 60s in America, is in need of editing.  The tale simply needs better pacing, using less footage to describe some events and more emphasis on the other aspects of each character's life.  But radiant performances by Lili Taylor and Guy Pearce (and with the fine support of Irma P. Hall, Sara Rue, and Tom Bower, etc) keep this 'first film' in the foreground of interest in Tyler's story and Kalem's future ventures.",4,A little chamber work of a film,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,2442,"['SLIPPING', 'DOWN', 'LIFE', 'obviously', 'work', 'love', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'won', 'recognition', 'Sundance', 'Festival', '1999', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', '2004', 'Adapted', 'Anne', 'Tyler', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'director', 'Toni', 'Kalem', 'carefully', 'recreated', 'shabby', 'little', 'North', 'Carolina', 'town', 'early', '1960s', 'actors', 'way', 'rural', 'mentality', 'drove', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'follow', 'piper', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'merely', 'escape', 'doldrums', 'corralled', 'future.Evie', 'Decker', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'yet', 'finely', 'tuned', 'portrayal', 'young', 'women', 'verge', 'self', 'extinction', 'plain', 'bored', 'young', 'lass', 'living', 'father', 'Tom', 'Bowers', 'mother', 'having', 'died', 'childbirth', 'kiddie', 'amusement', 'park', 'costume', 'silly', 'rabbit', 'view', 'world', 'role', 'bleak', 'say', 'least', 'only', 'friend', 'Violet', 'fine', 'cameo', 'Sara', 'Rue', 'who', 'overweight', 'hairdresser', 'two', 'attend', 'local', 'concert', 'rock', 'roll', 'music', 'discovering', 'strangely', 'hypnotic', 'idiosyncratic', 'singer', 'Drumstrings', 'Casey', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'always', 'extending', 'repertoire', 'character', 'types', ""'Priscilla"", 'Queen', 'Desert', ""'LA"", 'Confidential', ""'Memento"", 'etc', '.Drum', 'sidekick', 'David', 'John', 'Hawkins', 'will', 'go', 'extreme', 'publicize', 'partner', 'singing', 'career', 'when', 'Evie', 'Drum', 'spell', 'tawdry', 'tramps', 'vying', 'Drum', 'sexual', 'favors', 'carving', 'Casey', 'forehead', 'act', 'not', 'only', 'awakening', 'Evie', 'spirit', 'also', 'David', 'thought', 'publicity', 'Evie', 'carved', 'forehead', 'will', 'be', 'present', 'Drum', 'concerts', 'trademark', 'fan', 'devotion', 'now', 'awakened', 'Evie', 'eventually', 'Drum', 'cocoon', 'eventually', 'marry', 'only', 'encounter', 'realities', 'commitment', 'scenario', 'most', 'tender', 'fashion', 'best', 'withheld', 'viewer.This', 'film', 'very', 'fine', 'capturing', 'time', 'era', 'atmosphere', 'so', 'prevalent', 'turbulent', '60s', 'America', 'need', 'editing', 'tale', 'simply', 'better', 'pacing', 'using', 'less', 'footage', 'describe', 'events', 'more', 'emphasis', 'other', 'aspects', 'character', 'life', 'radiant', 'performances', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'fine', 'support', 'Irma', 'P.', 'Hall', 'Sara', 'Rue', 'Tom', 'Bower', 'etc', 'keep', ""'first"", 'film', 'foreground', 'interest', 'Tyler', 'story', 'Kalem', 'future', 'ventures']",N/A

She becomes a fan and then cuts his name into her forehead which kicks off a relationship and the beginning of their journey, the goal of which is to leave their dead end town.The two principles were a delight and the supporting cast was wonderful. However,  the direction and/ or script was peripatetic without the supporting architecture which would have made the characters' actions and secondary relationships transparent.

844516,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0002S94AM,Linda Linguvic,"[14, 14]","Adapted from a novel by Ann Tyler, this is a small independent film that has finally been released after being an limbo since 1998.  Toni Kalem, who sometimes appears as one of Carmela's friends in The Sopranos, is the writer/director of this film and she's taken the material and suited it well to the screen.Starring Lili Taylor as a mousy young woman in a rather bleak and depressed small town in the south, we can all identify with her attraction to a local rock musician played by Guy Pearce.  She becomes obsessed with him even though he doesn't even notice her.  Suddenly, in an act that shocked me with its suddenness, she goes into a ladies room and, with a piece of broken glass, she carves his name into her forehead.This, of course, gets his attention, and they even have their picture put in the newspaper together.  It's not surprising that a romance then blossoms and they marry.  During the rest of the film, we see the scar on her forehead in various stages of healing.  Lili Taylor is an incredibly gifted actress and she plays the role both tough and sweet with an inner core that is clear, pure and honest, especially as her husband's career is failing and she's the one who has to hold the relationship together.Most of the film is very subtle, the textures are soft, the feeling is quiet and we get a glimpse of the working class lives of the characters that is all about survival.  And yet there is love in this film and the eccentric romance is unique and interesting.  I would have enjoyed it a bit more if it were just a little shorter and moved a little faster.  However, I'm aware that this is my particular taste and the rather slow pacing of this offbeat romance was well suited to the material.  Recommended.",5,Offbeat and unique romance. Great characters.

Despite spotty reviews during its theatrical release, fans of novelist Anne Tyler or thoughtful independent film should grab this one, quickly.

Lili Taylor, while probably too old for the girl she's playing, is as intelligent and touching as always, while Guy Pearce gives one of his best performances as the rocker who's the object of her obsession.  Nice turns from Irma P. Hall and (making the best of small roles) Veronica Cartwright, Keith McDermott, Clea DuVall and Bruno Kirby.
