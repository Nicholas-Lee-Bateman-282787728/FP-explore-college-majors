All the stars were there for Real Madrid.  Of course the film shows its age with Beckham and Zidane both being out there for Real and Henry playing for Arsenal, but it was still fun to watch.There is some drama in the movie between Santiago Munez and his fiance that anyone could script.  He becomes a big star with lots of money and fans and she has to stay in England for nursing...you can guess the source of tension. The other twist is Munez' family.  His long lost mother and brother come into the picture.The character of Gavin Harris, Munez' teammate from Newcastle, now also with Real provides some humor and lightness to the film.Sure, it continues the Cinderella story, but you don't want it to end badly.  I think soccer fans and sports fans will like it and maybe the miss or mrs. won't mind it too much either.",5,I think this is as good as a sports movie gets,1239148800,"04 8, 2009",2009,943,"['soccer', 'fan', 'thought', 'game', 'scenes', 'were', 'well-done', 'was', 'almost', 'watching', 'real', 'Champions', 'League', 'games', 'stars', 'were', 'there', 'Real', 'Madrid', 'course', 'film', 'age', 'Beckham', 'Zidane', 'being', 'out', 'there', 'Real', 'Henry', 'playing', 'Arsenal', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'watch.There', 'drama', 'movie', 'Santiago', 'Munez', 'fiance', 'anyone', 'could', 'script', 'big', 'star', 'lots', 'money', 'fans', 'stay', 'England', 'nursing', 'can', 'guess', 'source', 'tension', 'other', 'twist', 'Munez', 'family', 'long', 'lost', 'mother', 'brother', 'come', 'picture.The', 'character', 'Gavin', 'Harris', 'Munez', 'teammate', 'Newcastle', 'now', 'also', 'Real', 'humor', 'lightness', 'film.Sure', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'badly', 'think', 'soccer', 'fans', 'sports', 'fans', 'will', 'like', 'maybe', 'miss', 'mrs.', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'too', 'much']",Goal II: Living The Dream (Gol 2: Viviendo El Sueño) [NTSC/REGION 1 & 4 DVD.

He accepts the offer, takes his fianc&eacute;e to live with him in Madrid, only to discover that many problems will begin to happen.First, he is caught by fame and wealth. He starts getting approached by girls, which obviously makes his fianc&eacute;e jealous and uncomfortable. His fiancee gets back home and knows after a while that he cheated on her during her leave. Also, he discovers that his mother, who abandoned him when he was young, is living in Madrid. He knows this from his little brother whom he met for the first time. In addition to the previous problems, he unconsciously is competing with his offence friend at Real Madrid, which creates some tension between them. All this affected his performance at the pitch.This movie depicts what these rich players go through. Their lives are not all about enjoying football and making lots of money, they also have lots of personal problems that do affect their gameplay. Check out the biographies of some of the big players and see for yourself. Maradona is a great example.Even though I am a Barca fan and wish Real Madrid would not win another game ever, I thought this movie was good.",5,Good promotion for Real Madrid,1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,1221,"['Munez', 'player', 'New', 'Castle', 'job', 'offer', 'play', 'Real', 'Madrid', 'offer', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'live', 'Madrid', 'only', 'discover', 'many', 'problems', 'will', 'begin', 'happen.First', 'caught', 'fame', 'wealth', 'getting', 'approached', 'girls', 'obviously', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'jealous', 'uncomfortable', 'fiancee', 'back', 'home', 'knows', 'while', 'cheated', 'leave', 'Also', 'mother', 'who', 'abandoned', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'living', 'Madrid', 'little', 'brother', 'whom', 'met', 'first', 'time', 'addition', 'previous', 'problems', 'unconsciously', 'competing', 'offence', 'friend', 'Real', 'Madrid', 'tension', 'affected', 'performance', 'pitch.This', 'movie', 'what', 'rich', 'players', 'go', 'lives', 'are', 'not', 'enjoying', 'football', 'making', 'lots', 'money', 'also', 'have', 'lots', 'personal', 'problems', 'do', 'affect', 'gameplay', 'Check', 'biographies', 'big', 'players', 'see', 'Maradona', 'great', 'example.Even', 'am', 'Barca', 'fan', 'wish', 'Real', 'Madrid', 'would', 'not', 'win', 'game', 'ever', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'good']",Goal II: Living The Dream (Gol 2: Viviendo El Sueño) [NTSC/REGION 1 & 4 DVD.

It wasn't that close, it didn't even hit the crossbar!!I so much enjoyed the first of the ""Goal!"" series, & while I totally recognize that this is all about Santiago Munez' coming to grips with stardom & the pitfalls there can be, I had a problem right off the bat:The first preview we get is for some wanker professional wrestler!! Now, if I'm trying to target soccer/futbol fans, wrasslin' is a natural fit....yeah, right!! I think the second preview was for some crap like ultimate fighting, but I didn't stick around long enough to find out.OK, as with ""Goal!"", ""Goal 2"" has great photography, and some characters we've come to care about, but that's where the family resemblance ends. Maybe to get Beckham and the true stars of Real Madrid to appear in this sequel they had to be guaranteed max on-screen time, but the match shots in the movie overpower what little plot there is.And speaking of plot, if it hadn't been some of the deleted scenes, the plot would have made no sense beyond the basics. I believe there were four deleted scenes: the 1st to re-show Kuno Becker's naked butt, but all the other three added far more to the plot than the many slow motion shots on goal.I think the most glaring shortcoming may have been the absence of the screenwriters of the original Goal!, the always steady Ian La Frenais and Dick ClementI really hope the next installment is better, but for football, give me the original ""Goal!"", the original ""Fever Pitch""(Colin Firth as an Arsenal fan- it's great!!), or a ""Greatest Goals"" DVD from the FA or FIFA.By the way, I really enjoyed hearing Beckham speak....now I know that the ""Dead Ringers"" satires of his speaking voice have been spot on!",3,Goal 2 sails over the crossbar & off the pitch,1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,1739,"['should', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'was', 'wide', 'open', 'was', ""n't"", 'close', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'hit', 'crossbar', 'so', 'much', 'first', 'Goal', 'series', 'totally', 'recognize', 'Santiago', 'Munez', 'coming', 'grips', 'stardom', 'pitfalls', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'problem', 'right', 'bat', 'first', 'preview', 'get', 'wanker', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'Now', ""'m"", 'trying', 'target', 'soccer/futbol', 'fans', 'wrasslin', 'natural', 'fit', '.yeah', 'right', 'think', 'second', 'preview', 'was', 'crap', 'ultimate', 'fighting', 'did', ""n't"", 'stick', 'around', 'long', 'enough', 'find', 'out.OK', 'Goal', 'Goal', '2', 'great', 'photography', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'come', 'care', 'where', 'family', 'resemblance', 'Maybe', 'get', 'Beckham', 'true', 'stars', 'Real', 'Madrid', 'appear', 'sequel', 'had', 'be', 'guaranteed', 'max', 'on-screen', 'time', 'match', 'shots', 'movie', 'what', 'little', 'plot', 'is.And', 'speaking', 'plot', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'basics', 'believe', 'were', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes', '1st', 're-show', 'Kuno', 'Becker', 'naked', 'butt', 'other', 'three', 'added', 'far', 'more', 'plot', 'many', 'slow', 'motion', 'shots', 'goal.I', 'think', 'most', 'glaring', 'shortcoming', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'absence', 'screenwriters', 'original', 'Goal', 'always', 'steady', 'Ian', 'La', 'Frenais', 'Dick', 'ClementI', 'really', 'hope', 'next', 'installment', 'better', 'football', 'give', 'original', 'Goal', 'original', 'Fever', 'Pitch', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Arsenal', 'fan-', 'great', 'Greatest', 'Goals', 'DVD', 'FA', 'FIFA.By', 'way', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'Beckham', 'speak', '.now', 'know', 'Dead', 'Ringers', 'satires', 'speaking', 'voice', 'have', 'been', 'spot']",Goal II: Living The Dream (Gol 2: Viviendo El Sueño) [NTSC/REGION 1 & 4 DVD.

1110238,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B000WM5NR6,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 0]","For anyone who has seen the movie ""Goal: The Dream Begins"", this film is a natural progression.  Most of the protagonists are the same, except that nature of their relationship changes drastically.  For fans of the soccer sport, this movie is a treat because many of the scenes are done on the soccer field where professionals showcase their soccer talent.Main character Santiago has made it to the big league.  He is ""in"" with the boys playing professional soccer, making lots of money.  He still has the same girlfriend, his Newcastle little nurse who is the grounding force in their relatonship.  But Santiago has turned into caricature.  He now wears expensive watch and sunglasses, has huge diamond earrings and fancy car and a house.  We do not see what, if anything he has done (financially or otherwise) for his aging grandmother and little brother who lived in US on the verge of poverty while Santiago is playing professional soccer in Madrid, Spain.Santiago is living a dream he alsways wanted, but that comes at a steep price. His relationship with his father was never fully repaired, and his father dies from heart attack.  Santiago's manager knows well that luck is short lived and in addition to managing Santiago's career, he still keeps his mechanic shop.  Santiago's colleagues and fighting to keep their place in the league and hide their signs of aging.  Then, his mother and half-brother appear out of no where and that rocks his world.I was disappointed about part 2. I expected more.  But if you like soccer and want to follow up on the story this film is must see.  I understand they are preparing ""Goal 3"" which will probably be titled ""The end of the Dream"" .  One can already see that Santiago is not street smart enough to take care of his career, his health and relaitonship with people he cares about.  I can already see that his dream will be over quick, faster than it started and he will fall into caring hands of his girlfriend, mother, grandmother and his talent agent.  Perhaps he will even become a mechanic and find some way to earn his living for the rest of his life.",3,Rags to riches,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,2108,"['anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'movie', 'Goal', 'Dream', 'Begins', 'film', 'natural', 'progression', 'Most', 'protagonists', 'are', 'same', 'nature', 'relationship', 'changes', 'drastically', 'fans', 'soccer', 'sport', 'movie', 'treat', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'soccer', 'field', 'where', 'professionals', 'showcase', 'soccer', 'talent.Main', 'character', 'Santiago', 'made', 'big', 'league', 'boys', 'playing', 'professional', 'soccer', 'making', 'lots', 'money', 'still', 'same', 'girlfriend', 'Newcastle', 'little', 'nurse', 'who', 'grounding', 'force', 'relatonship', 'Santiago', 'turned', 'caricature', 'now', 'expensive', 'watch', 'sunglasses', 'huge', 'diamond', 'earrings', 'fancy', 'car', 'house', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'anything', 'done', 'financially', 'otherwise', 'aging', 'grandmother', 'little', 'brother', 'who', 'lived', 'US', 'verge', 'poverty', 'Santiago', 'playing', 'professional', 'soccer', 'Madrid', 'Spain.Santiago', 'living', 'dream', 'wanted', 'steep', 'price', 'relationship', 'father', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'repaired', 'father', 'heart', 'attack', 'Santiago', 'manager', 'well', 'luck', 'short', 'lived', 'addition', 'managing', 'Santiago', 'career', 'still', 'mechanic', 'shop', 'Santiago', 'colleagues', 'fighting', 'keep', 'place', 'league', 'hide', 'signs', 'aging', 'Then', 'mother', 'half-brother', 'appear', 'where', 'world.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'part', '2', 'expected', 'more', 'like', 'soccer', 'want', 'follow', 'up', 'story', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'understand', 'are', 'preparing', 'Goal', '3', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'titled', 'end', 'Dream', 'One', 'can', 'already', 'see', 'Santiago', 'not', 'street', 'smart', 'enough', 'take', 'care', 'career', 'health', 'relaitonship', 'people', 'can', 'already', 'see', 'dream', 'will', 'be', 'quick', 'faster', 'started', 'will', 'fall', 'caring', 'hands', 'girlfriend', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'talent', 'agent', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'even', 'become', 'mechanic', 'find', 'way', 'earn', 'living', 'rest', 'life']",Goal II: Living The Dream (Gol 2: Viviendo El Sueño) [NTSC/REGION 1 & 4 DVD.
