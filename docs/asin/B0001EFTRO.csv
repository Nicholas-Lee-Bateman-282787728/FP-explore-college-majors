802034,A2HH9HB8IVSNAH,B0001EFTRO,"J. Fink ""hodgemo2""","[0, 0]","Comic party is a parody of the world of the doujin and doujinshi.  (fan anime).  It is very well drawn, and there are TONS of references that poke fun of other animes, which is fun.  However, if you don't REALLY KNOW you're anime (including some stuff that you can only get as fan subs), you may kinda feel like an outsider going &quot;and this is funny, how?&quot;On the other hand, Comic party is a cute story within itself.  It gives a little bit of a look inside one part of Japanese culture (the doujinshi side, of course), and the characters are anywhere from believable and mildly funny, to completely over the top.As far as the DVD itself is concerned, it is a bit of a bummer that you only get 3 episodes.  The mini-special, or whatever it is called is OK, but it seems to take place somewhere much further in the series, with characters you either don't know yet, or barely know at this point.  The special booklet that explains all of the references is neat, as are the translators notes.  After a while, though, it becomes a bit like a joke that you have to explain...how funny is that?  The interviews are good, but nothing too special.  Another note, I couldn't stand the dub of this, and would highly recommend watching the subtitled version.All in all, Comic Party is well worth a go, in my opinion.  It won't make you rave about it to your friends, you probably won't watch it over and over and over...you probably won't even be waiting with delicious anticipation until the next volume is released, but it is a good way to spend 2 hours.  Even if you aren't an otaku.",4,An above average anime parody,1085356800,"05 24, 2004",2004,1585,"['Comic', 'party', 'parody', 'world', 'doujin', 'doujinshi', 'fan', 'anime', 'very', 'well', 'drawn', 'are', 'TONS', 'references', 'poke', 'fun', 'other', 'animes', 'fun', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'REALLY', 'KNOW', ""'re"", 'anime', 'including', 'stuff', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'fan', 'subs', 'may', 'kinda', 'feel', 'outsider', 'going', 'quot', 'funny', 'how', 'quot', 'other', 'hand', 'Comic', 'party', 'cute', 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'look', 'one', 'part', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'doujinshi', 'side', 'course', 'characters', 'are', 'anywhere', 'believable', 'mildly', 'funny', 'completely', 'top.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'concerned', 'bit', 'bummer', 'only', 'get', '3', 'episodes', 'mini-special', 'whatever', 'called', 'OK', 'take', 'place', 'somewhere', 'much', 'further', 'series', 'characters', 'either', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'barely', 'know', 'point', 'special', 'booklet', 'references', 'neat', 'are', 'translators', 'notes', 'while', 'bit', 'joke', 'have', 'explain', 'how', 'funny', 'interviews', 'are', 'good', 'nothing', 'too', 'special', 'note', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'dub', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'subtitled', 'version.All', 'Comic', 'Party', 'well', 'go', 'opinion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'rave', 'friends', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'waiting', 'delicious', 'anticipation', 'next', 'volume', 'released', 'good', 'way', 'spend', '2', 'hours', 'Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'otaku']",N/A
802035,A3E5OY3YLZMOA9,B0001EFTRO,"Keith A. Jones ""Sonic Jones... I'm Kind Of A ...","[0, 1]","Comic party is a laid-back anime series that doesn't take a lot of intelligence to watch, you just need a very creative mind and a love for comedy or comic books. Although it may seem a bit slow at first it starts to hit you with some nutty scenes and characters like a guy that wants Kazuki to do what he does best and that's draw comics.In the editorial review it says that Mizuki (Girl on the cover) is Kazuki's girlfriend and she isn't. If she was his girlfriend then half the story would be gone because she's his best friend and she wants to be more than friends so that's why she gets mad at him a lot. She gets even more mad when Kazuki finally budges and starts doing comics and this takes away all the time they use to have together but Kazuki is stupid and doesn't realize Mizuki likes him. Really this series shows all the hardships of a kid who was Destine to be a comic book artist finally fulfill the dream he never had and his how his life is affected by it.Kazuki thought comics were easy but after finishing his first he found out different. The animation is pretty good, I see that for some reason some people don't like it but it looks clear and crisp so what more could you ask for. It's not like this is some kind of action anime. This first volume is very worth it, I can't really explain why some people don't like it but you should still check it out for yourself.",5,A perfect start,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,1389,"['Comic', 'party', 'laid-back', 'anime', 'series', ""n't"", 'take', 'lot', 'intelligence', 'watch', 'just', 'need', 'very', 'creative', 'mind', 'love', 'comedy', 'comic', 'books', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'slow', 'first', 'hit', 'nutty', 'scenes', 'characters', 'guy', 'Kazuki', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'draw', 'editorial', 'review', 'Mizuki', 'Girl', 'cover', 'Kazuki', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'was', 'girlfriend', 'then', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'gone', 'best', 'friend', 'be', 'more', 'friends', 'why', 'mad', 'lot', 'even', 'more', 'mad', 'when', 'Kazuki', 'finally', 'doing', 'comics', 'away', 'time', 'use', 'have', 'together', 'Kazuki', 'stupid', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Mizuki', 'Really', 'series', 'hardships', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'Destine', 'be', 'comic', 'book', 'artist', 'finally', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'never', 'had', 'how', 'life', 'affected', 'it.Kazuki', 'thought', 'comics', 'were', 'easy', 'finishing', 'first', 'found', 'out', 'different', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'see', 'reason', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'clear', 'so', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'not', 'kind', 'action', 'anime', 'first', 'volume', 'very', 'worth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'why', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'should', 'still', 'check', 'out']",N/A

A demo DVD included with the Newtype mag came out a couple months ago with the first full episode of this series. If you were not able to obtain a copy of that and have no idea what Comic Party is about, then this is for you especially.For anyone who's ever wanted to be a manga-ka, it isn't easy. First of all, most manga-ka start out as doujinshi (amateur comics) artists. That's what this series is about.Kazuki Sendo is a high school senior. He likes manga, but not enough to be an aspiring artist. That all changes when, one day, a friend of his drags him to a doujinshi convention. After meeting one of the artists and helping out for a while, he realizes suddenly that this must be his calling- manga writing... You get the picture, right? ^-^;;Anyway, the charming thing about this series is that any hardcore manga or anime fan can totally relate to Kazuki in the fact that he is fashioned after them in a way.",4,Very Interesting...,1086307200,"06 4, 2004",2004,995,"['read', 'Newtype', 'USA', 'then', 'may', 'already', 'be', 'familiar', 'series', 'demo', 'DVD', 'included', 'Newtype', 'mag', 'came', 'out', 'couple', 'months', 'first', 'full', 'episode', 'series', 'were', 'not', 'able', 'obtain', 'copy', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Comic', 'Party', 'about', 'then', 'especially.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'wanted', 'be', 'manga-ka', ""n't"", 'easy', 'First', 'most', 'manga-ka', 'start', 'doujinshi', 'amateur', 'comics', 'artists', 'what', 'series', 'about.Kazuki', 'Sendo', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'manga', 'not', 'enough', 'be', 'aspiring', 'artist', 'changes', 'when', 'one', 'day', 'friend', 'drags', 'doujinshi', 'convention', 'meeting', 'one', 'artists', 'helping', 'out', 'while', 'suddenly', 'must', 'be', 'calling-', 'manga', 'writing', 'get', 'picture', 'right', '^-^', 'Anyway', 'charming', 'thing', 'series', 'hardcore', 'manga', 'anime', 'fan', 'can', 'totally', 'relate', 'Kazuki', 'fact', 'fashioned', 'way']",N/A

But his childhood friend, Mizuki, isn't about to let him go without a fight.  Why she thinks he will somehow get trapped in the world of fan comics is anybody's guess.  Maybe she has a crush on him?Funny, touching, and really shows us how things work in Japan when it comes to fan comics and the business of fan comics.  Lots of good artwork, tons of extras and even a special mini episode to add to the other three full ones.  That's the only reason it failed to get five points - not enough episodes for the price.  But there is a lot of love and humor put into the disc.  Even the cover is from right to left format ""Manga Style"" and it comes with a booklet that helps explain some of the scenes in the episodes, so you don't miss anything.For 13 and up, but I feel younger viewers can watch without a problem.  115 minutes total.Great stuff from the Rightstuf!",4,A good story...,1105660800,"01 14, 2005",2005,935,"['Kazuki', 'dragged', 'world', 'fan', 'comics', 'friend', 'Taishi', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Mizuki', ""n't"", 'about', 'let', 'go', 'fight', 'Why', 'will', 'somehow', 'get', 'trapped', 'world', 'fan', 'comics', 'anybody', 'guess', 'Maybe', 'crush', 'Funny', 'touching', 'really', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'Japan', 'when', 'fan', 'comics', 'business', 'fan', 'comics', 'Lots', 'good', 'artwork', 'tons', 'extras', 'even', 'special', 'mini', 'episode', 'add', 'other', 'three', 'full', 'ones', 'only', 'reason', 'failed', 'get', 'five', 'points', 'not', 'enough', 'episodes', 'price', 'lot', 'love', 'humor', 'put', 'disc', 'Even', 'cover', 'right', 'left', 'format', 'Manga', 'Style', 'booklet', 'explain', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything.For', '13', 'up', 'feel', 'younger', 'viewers', 'can', 'watch', 'problem', '115', 'minutes', 'total.Great', 'stuff', 'Rightstuf']",N/A

He believes that the world can be conquered and ruled through the proliferation of manga. The problem is that he can't draw, and he can't write stories. That's where the main character of Comic Party Volume 1: A New World, enters the picture. Kazuki Sendoh has always been a good artist and his best friend Mizuki also has a little talent. Both are suckered into attending a doujinshi convention in which amateur manga artists ply their work to the buying public. Kazuki catches doujinshi fever and wants to produce his own work after seeing the passion of the creators of manga and by meeting such characters as Yuu, a glasses wearing Osakan quick on the draw with her fan, and her rival Eimi, a green-haired prima donna who believes her work outclasses all others. Mizuki, on the other hand, feels that being a doujinshi is a low-class trade and her feelings are only confirmed by what she sees as the deviant behavior of the otaku fanboy phenomenon. Volume 1 chronicles the early trials and tribulations of Kazuki and friends as he tries to make and sell his first book.This first volume is a modern anime classic by showing the dedication and passion that doujinshi artists must possess to produce manga solely on their own without a legion of assistants to help them. The series is also very funny, especially the animosity between Yuu and Eimi, who never fails to point out the resemblance between Yuu and wild mountain pandas. Don't forget Taishi, who seems to have been infected by every mad scientist stereotype but uses his mind only to further the cause of Kazuki. The music is great too, giving the series a late 80s or early 90s feel even though it came out in 2001. Great and highly recommended series. Based on the manga Comic Party.Extras include:A special 7 minute mini-episode in which while at a hot spring Kazuki and his friends are sucked into an underground world. Interviews with the Japanese actors who play Kazuki, Taishi, and Mizuki. A booklet with footnotes about the episodes.
