1429821,A3T29QVYZ7IBAL,B004V2S4QK,"Jennifer Chatham ""Mad Moose Mama""","[3, 3]","Norm MacDonald: Me Doing Standup takes us to the edge of jocularity with his comedic approach to standup comedy. Infamously known for his long, drawn out punchlines, and sarcastic, nonchalant wit, Norm delivers the laughs in this short, sixty minute, standup comedy routine.Ranging in topics from death, which will leave you gasping for breath as he approaches a delicate subject with mirth, to homosexuality, which was a little more difficult for him to pull off; it will leave you laughing until your sides ache! Other topics include alcoholism, family, the media, Tiger Woods, O.J. Simpson, and more!With a fair deal of profanity, the jokes are delivered in only a way that Norm MacDonald can pull off. Without being overly vulgar, he broaches some fairly risky topics without bearing malice from the audience. The faces shared of the crowd scenes shows them enjoying themselves and the event they are a part of, sometimes including the audience into his routine, the energy being fed to Norm is exactly the kind a comedian requires to enable a spectacular performance.Each segment of his act takes you on a roller coaster ride of laughs, riding each as you crest to the top and coast to the bottom to be uplifted time and again. If you are a Norm MacDonald fan, you will not be disappointed and, even if you aren't, this DVD has the merit to deliver.On the minor side of things, Norm is showing his age in this latest performance. His physique has changed considerably, his cheeks and nose reddened, his onstage presence slow to pick up; however, the punchlines are delivered with gusto and finesse.Included in this one-disk DVD you will be pleased to find bonus features which include Norm's pilot episode of Back To Norm, in which Rob Schneider guest hosted, also included is the roast of Bob Saget, which I found to be a bit wooden and cliched and the hilarious, animated short, ""The Twelves Days of Christmas"".",4,Nonchalant wit at its finest~!!,1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,1918,"['Norm', 'MacDonald', 'Me', 'Doing', 'Standup', 'edge', 'jocularity', 'comedic', 'approach', 'standup', 'comedy', 'Infamously', 'known', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'punchlines', 'sarcastic', 'nonchalant', 'wit', 'Norm', 'laughs', 'short', 'sixty', 'minute', 'standup', 'comedy', 'routine.Ranging', 'topics', 'death', 'will', 'leave', 'gasping', 'breath', 'delicate', 'subject', 'mirth', 'homosexuality', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'difficult', 'pull', 'off', 'will', 'leave', 'laughing', 'sides', 'ache', 'Other', 'topics', 'include', 'alcoholism', 'family', 'media', 'Tiger', 'Woods', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'more', 'fair', 'deal', 'profanity', 'jokes', 'are', 'delivered', 'only', 'way', 'Norm', 'MacDonald', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'being', 'overly', 'vulgar', 'fairly', 'risky', 'topics', 'bearing', 'malice', 'audience', 'shared', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'enjoying', 'event', 'are', 'part', 'sometimes', 'including', 'audience', 'routine', 'energy', 'being', 'fed', 'Norm', 'exactly', 'kind', 'comedian', 'enable', 'spectacular', 'performance.Each', 'segment', 'act', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'laughs', 'riding', 'crest', 'top', 'coast', 'bottom', 'be', 'uplifted', 'time', 'again', 'are', 'Norm', 'MacDonald', 'fan', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'merit', 'deliver.On', 'minor', 'side', 'things', 'Norm', 'showing', 'age', 'latest', 'performance', 'physique', 'changed', 'considerably', 'cheeks', 'nose', 'reddened', 'onstage', 'presence', 'slow', 'pick', 'up', 'however', 'punchlines', 'are', 'delivered', 'gusto', 'finesse.Included', 'one-disk', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'find', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'Norm', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Back', 'Norm', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'guest', 'hosted', 'also', 'included', 'roast', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'found', 'be', 'bit', 'wooden', 'cliched', 'hilarious', 'animated', 'short', 'Twelves', 'Days', 'Christmas']",Norm Macdonald: Me Doing Standup
