1048991,A3UQ3PNURYB0N3,B000MQ58XQ,Daniel Sutton,"[14, 31]","Dear Readers,Larry King is a fixture on CNN, and I watch his show fairly regularly.  I watch his show mostly for the entertainment value of his program, not to see a series of stellar interviews.  Another reviewer on this page notes that King does not do any research into his show guests in order to keep the interviews ""fresh.""  What this strategy guarantees, however, is that the guests will be able to run with the show and talk only about what they see fit, totally sidelining King.  The ""interviews"" thus turn out to be more of a PR stunt to the benefit of the guests than anything else.  It is a rare case in which King does in fact do a great interview, but I have seen it happen!If you want to see interviews with substance, do not watch ""Larry King Live.""  Watch Charlie Rose, or 60 Minutes.  Larry King's program is entertaining at times, but it is not worth watching for the interviews.Happy Watching!--Daniel",3,A mediocrA CNN Legend,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,921,"['Dear', 'Readers', 'Larry', 'King', 'fixture', 'CNN', 'watch', 'show', 'fairly', 'regularly', 'watch', 'show', 'mostly', 'entertainment', 'value', 'program', 'not', 'see', 'series', 'stellar', 'interviews', 'reviewer', 'page', 'King', 'not', 'do', 'research', 'show', 'guests', 'order', 'keep', 'interviews', 'fresh', 'What', 'strategy', 'however', 'guests', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'run', 'show', 'talk', 'only', 'what', 'see', 'fit', 'totally', 'sidelining', 'King', 'interviews', 'thus', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'PR', 'stunt', 'benefit', 'guests', 'anything', 'else', 'rare', 'case', 'King', 'fact', 'do', 'great', 'interview', 'have', 'seen', 'happen', 'want', 'see', 'interviews', 'substance', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'Larry', 'King', 'Live', 'Watch', 'Charlie', 'Rose', '60', 'Minutes', 'Larry', 'King', 'program', 'entertaining', 'times', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'interviews.Happy', 'Watching', 'Daniel']",LARRY KING LIVE:GREATEST INTERVIEWS COLL

Its what Larry King is all about..nothing really too in-depth and a its a nice walk down memory lane. The second disc really brought back some of the big news stories over the years.
