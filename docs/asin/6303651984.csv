384255,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,6303651984,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[7, 12]","Let's see, where have I seen elements of this movie before... ""Fatal Attraction, The Crush"" both roll off my tongue immediately, but I'm sure I've seen this story line many times more, and done better at that. An obssessed young lady sets her scope on the film's lead male role, a stud college baseball player and tests his morals, then leads him little by little to the inevitable path that we've seen all too often. This movie is merely a toy for the male demographic who probably grew up watching Molly Ringwald and always fantasized about her being in a role like this. Come to think of it, this may well have been the same thing for the director of this uninspired schlock. There's only one reason to watch this flick- Molly gets it! Oh boy, does Molly get it. But even that scene is a contrived setting with nill plausibility, as can be said for this movie in general. Molly's in a sexy role, which given the release date (95) may have been in desperation to shed her ""brat pack"" typecasting. Come to think of it, if that was the case, why did she even think about doing ""Townies,"" the ill fated sitcom attempt by the lucsious red-head. That aside, there's a good reason many haven't seen this flick. It didn't have a long run on any movie channels (not to mention the theater), so it was easy to miss. And its DVD release hasn't sounded anyone's alarms either. If you wanna see ""Samantha"" finally make it to the big leagues, go for it. But FYI, it's not a very explicit scene, not even late nite Cinemax caliber, but perhaps still satisfying enough for some. Otherwise, go for classic Molly stuff.",2,"Been there, done that, seen that.

Sorry for being sexist, but the sight of Molly Ringwald's breasts are pretty much all this film promises.  The plot -- a Fatal Attraction rip-off -- is obvious, the ending predictable, and the acting is pretty much second-rate except for Ringwald who reveals a zest for over-the-top villiany and, in her earlier scenes, actually does manage to bring some sympathy to her spurned woman.  Still, the film is mostly a tease that lures its male viewers along with the promise of showing us what we were fantasizing about during the Breakfast Club.  It must be said that when they finally do make their debut, Molly's breasts are not a disappointment -- even if the rest of the film is.  Still, its hard to get over the fact that this is the quissential '80s teenager -- the star of 16 Candles, the girl who helped make &quot;Are you a virgin, Clare?&quot; a pop cultural catch phrase -- wandering around topless and engaging in soft-core sex.  Its one of those weird, pop moments that pretty much distances the viewer from the film (so much as it is).  But that curiosity valure pretty much gives the movie whatever worth it might have.
