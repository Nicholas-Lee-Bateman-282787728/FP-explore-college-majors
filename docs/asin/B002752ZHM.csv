This event, for sure, is fitting that he has been honored and celebrated.My main issue with this is that a few of the singers just don't cut it anymore. I realize that they all have been forces in prior years but, gee, when your voice says enough well.......I was very excited to get this when it was released and I do enjoy the redeeming quality of the band. The players are fantastic. The people who put the show together could have chosen singers who can really still sing!Should you desire to watch a show with singers and band that will blow you away, choose to purchase ""Hit Man"" celebrating David Foster.

For all of the extrodinary talent and musicianship assembled for this once in a lifetime event it left me wanting. The video was shot extremely well and I will watch it,probably just with the LPCM stereo mix",3,Wanted to Love it...Just misses mark,1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,457,"['premise', 'execution', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'really', 'wanted', 'give', 'concert', 'five', 'stars', 'concert', 'sound', 'mix', 'was', 'definately', 'lacking', 'poor', 'sound', 'staging', 'instruments', 'seeming', 'lost', 'entirely', 'DTS', 'HD', 'Master', 'included', 'extrodinary', 'talent', 'musicianship', 'assembled', 'once', 'lifetime', 'event', 'left', 'wanting', 'video', 'was', 'shot', 'extremely', 'well', 'will', 'watch', 'probably', 'just', 'LPCM', 'stereo', 'mix']",N/A
1252425,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B002752ZHM,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[25, 26]","Quincy Jones has had one heck of a career! Older jazz fans know him from his years as trumpeter and arranger for Dizzy Gillespie, sixties rock and roll fans know him from all the hits he produced with Lesley Gore and - of course - everyone knows him from his work on the mega-platinum albums of Michael Jackson. He even worked with early hip-hop artists with his ""Back On The Block"" CD - still one of my favorites.Jones is highly respected in every pop and jazz genre and has fostered young musicians with his involvement in school music programs and with scholarships.This beautifully crafted - once-in-a-lifetime concert - was organized by Montreux Jazz Festival founder Claude Nobs - in July 2008 and features, not only well know artists who Jones has worked with over his career - a literal ""who's who""  including, Al Jarreau, Toots Theilmans, James Moody, Nana Mouskouri, Petula Clark, Chaka Kahn and the incredible Patti Austin  - who in my opinion steals the show! It concert must have lated longer, but its edited here down to THREE HOURS! The combinations of performers is unique: Herbie Hancock, with Patti Austin vocalizing on the theme from the film ""The Good , The Bad and the Ugly"" start it off and later Miss Austin joins Miss Kahn for ""Miss Celie's Blues"" from the film ""The Color Purple"". (Oh did I mention that Jones composed lots of film scores, including this one? Michael Jackson was not in attendance at the party so All Jarreau and the a capella group Naturally 7, handle his hits. The camera work is excellent - as it usually is on the Montreux Jazz DVDs from Eagle Vision and there's a nice 48-page booklet of photos and tributes included. (They could have used some of those pages to discuss Q's career, but that's just a minor quibble.The guy is still producing and making great music at age 76.
