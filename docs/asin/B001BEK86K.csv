Her immature husband (Matthew Broderick) is leaving her; her endearing adoptive mother dies; and her estranged natural mother (Bette Midler) crosses her path. Throw in meeting the parent (Colin Firth) of one of her young students, and you've befuddled Gail Sheehy's 'Passages'. Genuine laughs and some heartfelt soul searching make for a dramedy of substance. Midler is fresh and funny as the talk show host mother; Firth shows more repertoire in a strong, solid character role as her boyfriend; but Hunt carries the show with her frayed character who gets deeper as her ordeal of romance and faith move along.

The movie is watchable, but I find a number of aspects somewhat hard to believe. First of all, Helen Hunt looks way too old in the movie even to be playing a person who is almost too old to have a baby. She is really in her mid 40s and was playing someone who was supposed to be 39, but she looked more like 50. Second, the intitial interaction between April and her biological mother doesn't seem very believable. Third, the Broderick chataceter doesn't seem very believeable as a teacher. He doesn't seem like a teacher and apparently just walks off the job to go live with his mom. Fourth, April seems like she doesn't go to work very much for a teacher. After the first few scenes in the movie, she seems to be everywhere but school during the day. Fifth, the relationship between April and the father of her student seems a little quick and odd.

1171692,AXOZ5BWOEDL76,B001BEK86K,Andrew C. Miller,"[0, 0]","Then She Found Me [2007] [Blu-ray] A FINE UNPREDICTABLE COMEDY!This touching, warmly amusing story directed by Helen Hunt, follows schoolteacher April Epner [Helen Hunt] on her very unlikely path toward personal fulfilment. Following here separation from her husband Ben Green [Mathew Broderick] and the death of her adoptive mother, April is contacted by her apparent birth mother Bernice Graves [Bette Midler], a colourful local talk show host who&#8217;s not exactly the ideal mum. As she tries to become her mother to April that she never was able to be, April finds solace in the arms of the father of one of her students Frank [Colin Firth]. With every aspect of her world turned upside down, April must learn how to cope with an age-old truth &#8211; life can change in a heartbeat.Cast: Helen Hunt, Bette Midler, Colin Firth, Matthew Broderick, Ben Shenkman, Salman Rushdie, John Benjamin Hickey and Lynn CohenDirector: Helen HuntProducers: Christine Vachon, Connie Tavel, Helen Hunt, Katie Roumel and Pamela KofflerScreenwriters: Alice Arlen, Helen Hunt and Victor LevinMusic: David MansfieldCinematography: Peter DonahueResolution: 1080pAspect Ratio: 1.78:1Audio: English: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and English: 5.1 Dolby DigitalSubtitles: English SDH and SpanishRunning Time: 100 minutesNumber of discs: 1Region: Region A/1Studio: Image EntertainmentAndrew&#8217;s Blu-ray Review &#8211; Cinema is littered with failed film made by big stars turned first-time directors. Eddie Murphy's 'Harlem Nights,' Ethan Hawke's 'The Hottest State,' Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh's 'The Anniversary Party' and Madonna's recent 'Filth & Wisdom' are just a few examples of arguably terrible movies that are clear reminders that sometimes, actors should stick to their day jobs. So it's a nice surprise when, every once in a while, a film made by a thespian comes along that actually isn't entirely dreadful. Helen Hunt's 'Then She Found Me' is just such a movie, one that's certainly flawed but made with such obvious passion that you want to cheer Hunt on just for getting more right than wrong.Based on the book by Elinor Lipman, Hunt not only stars and directs, but also co-wrote the screenplay with Alice Arlen and Victor Levin. She retains the basic structure of Victor Lipman's novel if streamlining many of its subplots and characters. The premise veers into Woody Allen territory, a slice of Jewish urban angst that sees Hunt as New York schoolteacher April Epner, a recent divorcee whose ex-husband Benjamin [Matthew Broderick] left her because of her desire to have children, which is only compounded after her adoptive mother unexpectedly dies. Attempting to re-start her life, April finds herself in a myriad of dramedy complications, including the return of her intrusive biological mother [Bette Midler], her comically morose brother [Ben Shenkman] and a potential new boyfriend [Colin Firth] who is the father of one of her students.The story of 'Then She Found Me' is nothing new. It's Female Empowerment 101, and had the tone been comedic, it could have just as easily starred Sandra Bullock. We can immediately anticipate all of the staple scenes to come, including April's first slapstick encounter with Midler, her meet-cute with Firth, and the eventual return of Benjamin, just at the moment when April will need to make her crucial romantic decision of whether to pursue her new suitor. Though Hunt's script and direction are blatant in bringing Victor Lipman's spiritual and thematic concerns to the fore, which gives 'Then She Found Me' an intellectual bent rare for a romantic comedy, it remains a bit too precious to truly surmount the limitations of its genre.Indeed, April herself can be insufferable. Her predicament is certainly relatable, but her lack of humour and warmth (which is not helped by Hunt, who can come off as a cold actress) is not. It's intriguing that, as she elaborates on the included audio commentary, Hunt laboured for so many years to bring this story to the screen. April's realisations are ultimately not all that revelatory, and her frequent wallowing in self-pity often makes her seem a passive bystander in her own life rather than an active participant. It's often frustrating to watch, and the film's denouement just isn't emotionally transformative enough to truly make the journey worth it.What Hunt does succeed in bringing to 'Then She Found Me' is insight and earnestness, sort of like a distaff Edward Burns movie but far less pretentious and grating. Hunt is refreshing in her lack of visual ticks and self-conscious camera moves, and instead aims for the immediacy of a stage play. Her style is workmanlike and unpretentious (the Woody Allen influence is clear), which allows the fine cast to shine. Though I find Midler simply annoying these days (ever since 'The First Wives Club,' she's played every role the same way), Firth brings a real charm to a potentially awkward character, while the underrated Shenkman provides plenty of droll laughs. Ironically, Hunt's own performance suffers even more by comparison, as she sometimes feels overwhelmed by the other characters in the movie, they steal the show.'Then She Found Me' is ultimately a small movie in every sense of the word, but not quite a real sleeper. Its lead character is just too oft-putting, and the story's themes too off-the-rack. Yet at the same time, Hunt is so committed to her story and her filmmaking that 'Then She Found Me' is a film that you can't help but root for. It's refreshing to find a film these days whose maker truly seemed determined to make. I wish I could have fully embraced 'Then She Found Me,' but however imperfect, it's at least a work driven by passion not profit.Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; The definition of &#34;small people picture,&#34; 'Then She Found Me' is hardly the type of material that screams high-def. This 1080p encode image is simply nice and pleasant, delivering a good-looking picture but nothing more. The film has a realistic, non-stylized appearance. Colours are well-saturated and natural, if on the bland side. The transfer handles the palette well, however, with a clean look and accurate flesh tones. Detail is merely average, with a softness to the image which flattens out depth. The source is in good shape, however, with nice blacks and smooth contrast. Shadow delineation is average as well, with darker scenes offering little real fine texture. There are no major compression artefacts, and noise and edge enhancement are not problematic.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; I didn't expect much from the audio on 'Then She Found Me,' but this is quite a strong English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround soundtrack. It serves the material very well, and even has a few moments of inspired subtlety. I liked how well-done discrete effects and atmosphere are, which gives this mix a surprisingly strong rear presence. The back channels are usually alive with minor effects or score bleed, and sometimes more pronounced moments. The quality of the recording is likewise impressive, with a wide dynamic range and low bass that is prominent but non-intrusive. Dialogue is also front-and-center, as it should be, with spoken words always intelligible and never overwhelmed by the rest of the mix. Sure, 'Then She Found Me' is not a demo disc, but it's hard to imagine the material could have been served more properly.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Audio Commentary: Helen Hunt flies solo on this track, and it is one of the best I've heard in ages. This first-time director explains that she came into her first commentary completely prepared, aiming the track at fellow neophyte filmmakers. Her extensive experience as an actress who has worked with some of the greats is also well in evidence, and she comes off as intelligent and insightful about every aspect of her film and craft. She also provides a welcome thesis on the film's main themes, as well as continual detail on how she structured each scene. Thorough, witty, and passionate, Hunt shows us how a commentary is done right.Interviews [28:00] Nearly a half-hour of interviews is included, with Hunt and stars Colin Firth, Bette Midler, and Matthew Broderick. An off-screen interviewer guides the discussion, and if these chats are static in presentation, the content is very strong. (Only Hunt's nearly 10-minute talk is a bit redundant after the commentary).Theatrical Trailers [HD] The film&#8217;s original trailer is provided in full HD video.Finally, 'Then She Found Me' is a small but very engaging film, and a notable directorial debut for star Helen Hunt. This Blu-ray gives it a fine presentation, with good video and nice audio sound and a few worthwhile supplements. Still, 'Then She Found Me' isn't really material that calls out for a high-definition presentation, the Blu-ray release is undoubtedly the best this film will look for quite some time. Devoted fans of the film's actors may be curious to check this title out, but otherwise, &#8216;Then She Found Me&#8217; will probably float under the radar for most, but if you are in the mood for something different on Blu-ray, this is definitely worth a look and it is a wonderful winner all the way, as I never got to see this when it was released in the cinema, but wow what a joy to get this Blu-ray as all the actors give a truly outstanding performance and should of got some kind of gong for their efforts. But one word of warning, get your Kleenex tissues out, as this is a 10 hanky emotional roller coaster emotional ride and I am so proud to add this to my ever increasing Bette Midler Blu-ray Collection, as I cannot praise this film enough.

The directorial debut from Helen Hunt seemed poised for promising things, but never found an audience.  Its widest release was a paltry 153 theaters.  Box office receipts fell just short of $4 million domestically.  The worldwide tally was right on $8m according to Box Office Mojo.The reason?  Like others on these pages have noted, of the four main characters only Bette Midler was likable.  Delightfully so.  I spent the time The Divine Miss M was off-screen waiting for her to return.  Helen Hunt looks tired and determinedly unhappy.  Matthew Broderick is odd, nebbish (and chunky to boot).  Colin Firth's character keeps an explosive temper barely under wraps.  I realize these are the roles they're playing, but the result is that you're hard-pressed to root for any of these three.However, my kudos to Ms. Hunt for the awesome stunt-casting of Salman Rushdie as a gynecologist.  That rocked.  I felt like I was in on a nice inside joke there.  And I would have found more scenes to deploy Ben Shenkman, who appears here as Ms. Hunt's on-screen brother.

I love all of these actors and actresses separately; but together in this movie, I have to say that it left me a little cold.  I asked myself how this could be and I think that a major problem was casting; I just could not believe Matthew Broderick acting in that way towards Helen Hunt (unless he was still playing Ferris Bueller as one poster humorously pointed out); Colin Firth in this part was not believable and Bette Midler certainly did not come across as Mom.I think Helen Hunt saved the day.  April Epner (Hunt) is thrown into a tizzy when her child husband (Ben) abandons her and moves back with his own Mom.  Hunt is left to find her own way; along that trail she meets Colin Firth (one of her student's fathers) and encounters or is more accosted by Bette Midler who we come to find out is April's biological mother.  How April loses and finds love and all of the discoveries she makes about her personal relationships never quite amount to the self discovery she makes about herself and what she wants out of life and what she wants from herself and others.The cast is great; but for me there was a big something missing.  It was quite simply an unexpected let down.  But for those staying in on a rainly afternoon, this is a movie which may help you pass the time (if you are for example in the woods without any transportation and cannot find anything else to do).Not an awful film; but not a great one either - 3 starsBentley/2008",3,The Unexpected,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,1576,"['would', 'think', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'would', 'have', 'hit', 'comedy', 'guess', 'again', 'love', 'actors', 'separately', 'together', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'left', 'little', 'cold', 'asked', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'think', 'major', 'problem', 'was', 'casting', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'acting', 'way', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'was', 'still', 'playing', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'one', 'poster', 'humorously', 'pointed', 'out', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'Mom.I', 'think', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'saved', 'day', 'April', 'Epner', 'Hunt', 'thrown', 'tizzy', 'when', 'child', 'husband', 'Ben', 'back', 'own', 'Mom', 'Hunt', 'left', 'find', 'own', 'way', 'trail', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'one', 'student', 'fathers', 'encounters', 'more', 'accosted', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'who', 'come', 'find', 'out', 'April', 'biological', 'mother', 'How', 'April', 'love', 'discoveries', 'personal', 'relationships', 'never', 'quite', 'amount', 'self', 'discovery', 'what', 'life', 'what', 'herself', 'others.The', 'cast', 'great', 'was', 'big', 'something', 'missing', 'was', 'quite', 'simply', 'unexpected', 'let', 'down', 'staying', 'rainly', 'afternoon', 'movie', 'may', 'help', 'pass', 'time', 'are', 'example', 'woods', 'transportation', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'anything', 'else', 'do', '.Not', 'awful', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'one', '3', 'starsBentley/2008']",Then She Found Me

1171703,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B001BEK86K,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[5, 7]","I would have called this movie, ""The Importance of Being Helen Hunt.""  When you incorporate everything on the DVD, including the commentary and interviews, I felt like the entire experience of ""Then She Found Me"" was more like watching a documentary on the talented actor, director, and artist.  On this basis, I gladly awarded five stars, which I will expain in a minute.Limiting my commentary to just the footage, I would have awarded four stars, taking one away for how things occasionally jumped ahead way too fast, for example, when Colin's character and Helen's character first meet.  They seem to progress to intimacy almost immediately, which didn't make sense given their personalities.  And we didn't get much (any?) background on him.  Another example is at the end, when the film takes a huge leap forward without allowing the viewer to participate.  I felt like we lost what could have been a solid 20 minutes of quality character development and lovely compromise.  Instead, we have to guess how these two very likable characters arrived at the most important decisions of the film.I felt like this experience was really referendum on Helen Hunt, the actor, the ambitious artist, and the graceful storyteller.  First the actor.  I'm sure Hollywood has amazing technology to improve someone's appearance.  OK fine.  To this 40ish reviewer, Ms. Hunt looked amazing, and like most beautiful women, she looked her best whenever she was exceedingly happy (several moments), and whenever she was very unhappy (most of the balance of the movie).The unhappiness seemed to dominate, for example when men (or birth mothers) were letting her down, and when the lonliness seemed too much to bear.  At these times, her appearance was striking.  When Helen takes yet another deep breath or heavy sigh in weary resignation, its as if she's carrying the woes of the world on her shoulders.  It makes you want to reach through the screen and give her a hug.The ambitious artist - if there is any message on the DVD extras its that Helen Hunt worked long and hard financially, artistically, persuasively, and courageously to make this project a reality.  Hollywood is becoming so ""big budget/same old thing,"" I can imagine all of the stereotypes she had to overcome to get this film completed.Finally, graceful story teller.

It has now been replaced by the more realistic and they lived `somewhat content for the time being'. Yes, in my estimation the film is indeed that cynical and pessimistic. This assumption on my part is further supported by the Jewish joke told at the beginning and end of the movie. It's about a trusting child being told by his Father to jump off a high step only to be allowed to fall instead of being caught by his Dad as promised. What's the lesson? I guess it's something like even the ones you love the most will let you down, or worse, don't trust anyone.Needless to say I didn't enjoy this film despite the presence of the usually charming Colin Firth and the always vulnerable, girl-next-door Helen Hunt.

1171725,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001BEK86K,Ed Uyeshima,"[111, 123]","Released earlier this year, Baby Mama covers the same emotional territory but in much broader slapstick terms, while this 2008 serio-comedy is driven far more by character than situation. In this case, the protagonist is 39-year-old April Epner, a New York kindergarten teacher who was raised in a close-knit Jewish family and desperately wants the biological connection of a birth child before her alarm clock goes off. She marries fellow teacher Ben, an inarticulate schlub with a terminal case of the Peter Pan Syndrome. After a brief time, he wants out of the marriage, and at almost the same time, April's adoptive mother Trudy dies. Not even a month goes by before April's biological mother suddenly shows up in the form of the brazenly overbearing but genuinely likeable Bernice Graves, a cable talk-show hostess who is something of a local media celebrity. If life was not complicated enough, April also finds herself drawn to Frank, the single father of one of her pupils. Unlike Ben, he feels the same about April but is fighting his own bitterness about his own recent divorce.Not only does Helen Hunt star as April, but she also co-wrote the screenplay with Alice Arlen and Victor Levin and makes her big-screen directorial debut. Granted she's more impressive as an actress than a filmmaker, but as a director and writer, she makes the most of a storyline that stacks the deck a bit like a Lifetime TV-movie. There are enough realistic surprises that take the plot off the rails in a good way. Looking gaunt and avoiding much make-up, Hunt is really playing a variation of the beaten-down waitress she played inAs Good As It Gets, as she carries that same constantly pained expression of disappointment and looks about to explode during moments of emotional duress. However, a decade later, Hunt inhabits the character more naturalistically this time and with a deeper sense of vulnerability and haggard exhaustion. Perhaps to minimize any unnecessary dramatic risk, Hunt cast the other principal roles with actors playing familiar parts. Matthew Broderick effectively portrays Ben as the perpetually dazed man-child he is, while perennial love interest Colin Firth gives texture to the seemingly ideal suitor Frank, especially as he edges toward the breaking point in tolerating the sum of April's foibles.In one of her increasingly rare screen appearances, Bette Midler gives a scene-stealing performance as Bernice. She lights up the movie with the character's unfettered sense of abandonment while gradually exposing the secrets that threaten to undermine her newly found relationship with her daughter. Other parts are played with minimum fuss - Ben Shenkman as April's physician brother Freddy feeling put-upon for having a biological tie to their mother, and Salman Rushdie (yes, the controversial author ofThe Satanic Verseswhich brought him a death sentence from the Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989) as April's doctor. Hunt provides the principal actors, especially herself, plenty of good, meaty scenes with opportunities for bravura moments, and they do deliver. It just doesn't quite come together as a whole by the end, and that may be that Hunt is so used to the sitcom format of the long-running series,Mad About You. The incomplete result is that some laughs feel a bit contrived, some scene transitions seem jarring, and some expected character revelations are given short shrift. Nonetheless, the dramatic developments toward the end carry the emotional impact necessary to make the movie truly affecting, and Hunt should be given full credit for a most auspicious debut as a filmmaker.",4,Another Biological Clock Ticks...But Hunt Provides Heart and Conviction to Her Directorial Debut,1218067200,"08 7, 2008",2008,3612,"['Released', 'earlier', 'year', 'Baby', 'Mama', 'same', 'emotional', 'territory', 'much', 'broader', 'slapstick', 'terms', '2008', 'serio-comedy', 'driven', 'far', 'more', 'character', 'situation', 'case', 'protagonist', '39-year-old', 'April', 'Epner', 'New', 'York', 'kindergarten', 'teacher', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'close-knit', 'Jewish', 'family', 'desperately', 'biological', 'connection', 'birth', 'child', 'alarm', 'clock', 'off', 'fellow', 'teacher', 'Ben', 'inarticulate', 'schlub', 'terminal', 'case', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Syndrome', 'brief', 'time', 'marriage', 'almost', 'same', 'time', 'April', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'Trudy', 'dies', 'Not', 'even', 'month', 'April', 'biological', 'mother', 'suddenly', 'up', 'form', 'brazenly', 'overbearing', 'genuinely', 'likeable', 'Bernice', 'Graves', 'cable', 'talk-show', 'hostess', 'who', 'something', 'local', 'media', 'celebrity', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'complicated', 'enough', 'April', 'also', 'drawn', 'Frank', 'single', 'father', 'one', 'pupils', 'Ben', 'same', 'April', 'fighting', 'own', 'bitterness', 'own', 'recent', 'divorce.Not', 'only', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'star', 'April', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Alice', 'Arlen', 'Victor', 'Levin', 'big-screen', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Granted', 'more', 'impressive', 'actress', 'filmmaker', 'director', 'writer', 'most', 'storyline', 'deck', 'bit', 'Lifetime', 'TV-movie', 'are', 'enough', 'realistic', 'surprises', 'take', 'plot', 'rails', 'good', 'way', 'Looking', 'gaunt', 'avoiding', 'much', 'make-up', 'Hunt', 'really', 'playing', 'variation', 'beaten-down', 'waitress', 'played', 'inAs', 'Good', 'same', 'constantly', 'pained', 'expression', 'disappointment', 'explode', 'moments', 'emotional', 'duress', 'However', 'decade', 'later', 'Hunt', 'character', 'more', 'naturalistically', 'time', 'deeper', 'sense', 'vulnerability', 'haggard', 'exhaustion', 'Perhaps', 'minimize', 'unnecessary', 'dramatic', 'risk', 'Hunt', 'cast', 'other', 'principal', 'roles', 'actors', 'playing', 'familiar', 'parts', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'effectively', 'Ben', 'perpetually', 'dazed', 'man-child', 'perennial', 'love', 'interest', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'texture', 'seemingly', 'ideal', 'suitor', 'Frank', 'especially', 'breaking', 'point', 'tolerating', 'sum', 'April', 'foibles.In', 'one', 'increasingly', 'rare', 'screen', 'appearances', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'scene-stealing', 'performance', 'Bernice', 'up', 'movie', 'character', 'unfettered', 'sense', 'abandonment', 'gradually', 'exposing', 'secrets', 'threaten', 'undermine', 'newly', 'found', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Other', 'parts', 'are', 'played', 'minimum', 'fuss', 'Ben', 'Shenkman', 'April', 'physician', 'brother', 'Freddy', 'feeling', 'put-upon', 'having', 'biological', 'tie', 'mother', 'Salman', 'Rushdie', 'yes', 'controversial', 'author', 'ofThe', 'Satanic', 'Verseswhich', 'brought', 'death', 'sentence', 'Ayatollah', 'Khomeini', '1989', 'April', 'doctor', 'Hunt', 'principal', 'actors', 'especially', 'plenty', 'good', 'meaty', 'scenes', 'opportunities', 'bravura', 'moments', 'do', 'deliver', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'come', 'together', 'whole', 'end', 'may', 'be', 'Hunt', 'so', 'used', 'sitcom', 'format', 'long-running', 'series', 'Mad', 'incomplete', 'result', 'laughs', 'feel', 'bit', 'contrived', 'scene', 'transitions', 'seem', 'jarring', 'expected', 'character', 'revelations', 'are', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'Nonetheless', 'dramatic', 'developments', 'end', 'carry', 'emotional', 'impact', 'necessary', 'make', 'movie', 'truly', 'affecting', 'Hunt', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'full', 'credit', 'most', 'auspicious', 'debut', 'filmmaker']",Then She Found Me

Her cast shares in the very sentimental story of Hunt's devotion and seemingly endless charisma and abilities. The explanation for making this budget film are in many ways more successful than the film, a work the cast seems determined to classify as a comedy but a work that is far more a human drama.April Epner (Helen Hunt) is married to fellow schoolteacher Ben Green (Matthew Broderick) and longs to have a baby before her advancing age prevents her dream.  April was adopted as an infant by a Jewish couple who subsequently gave birth to April's brother Freddy (Ben Shenkman): April has always longed to have been Freddy's biological equal, wondering what it would feel like NOT to be adopted.  April's busy life implodes: Ben has decided he doesn't like his life and leaves April, April's mother dies, April meets Frank (Colin Firth) a recently divorced writer and father of two children,  and April is contacted by a man who can put April in touch with her birth mother - popular TV talk show hostess Bernice Graves (Bette Midler). And if these turns of events weren't traumatic enough, April discovers that she has become pregnant by Ben and Ben is unsure whether he can handle the restructuring of his life to accommodate April.  Cautiously April and Frank begin a rather tenuous courtship which is almost immediately threatened by April's discovery of her pregnant state.  April and Bernice meet, exchange backgrounds, and make pacts to test their biologic relationship.  How each of these characters makes promises that eventually damage each other and then resolve in unexpected ways becomes a study of the meaning of love and compassion among fragile human beings.While not a satisfying story on every level and a film too cluttered with inconvenient editing choices, the cast is strong and obviously committed, and the story (neither a comedy or a drama but a mixture of the two) tests credibility.  But there are some fine moments and the lessons in human behavior are worth examining.  Not a great movie but a strong little small budget film.

Of course I only watched it in the first place because Colin Firth was in it. It was a good story though. Helen Hunt plays a confused and rather foolish woman who desperately wants to have a baby, but who is married to a man (Matthew Broderick) that doesn't want the responsibilities of marriage anymore and moves back into his mothers house. Then Hunt discovers she is pregnant and at the same time finds out her birth mother (Bette Midler) that gave her up now wants to be part of her life. Bette Midlers character is suppose to be annoying and narcissistic so she is well cast. Colin Firth is the good and sane relationship in her life. He plays a man with two small children who's wife also no longer wants the responsibilities of marriage or motherhood. Helen Hunt is the teacher of one of the children and that is how they meet.

""Then She Found Me"" finds Hunt working as screenwriter, director, actress & producer.  It is quite a lot for one project, which may explain why the film works only moderately well.  In the DVD extras, Hunt discusses making the rookie director mistake of acting in your own movie, but defends it because she wouldn't have ""had time to communicate to another actress.""  The result doesn't support the viewpoint.  Hunt looks much better in the interview in the DVD extras than she does in the film.  A director who was not directing herself would have made sure her star in a romantic comedy would look good.  Even though Hunt has an Oscar forAs Good As It Gets& even though I love her great talent, this did not work.  There's a scene where Hunt comes to her husband in a negligee.  While the negligee looks good, where were the makeup artist and the hair stylist?  There was no reason for Hunt's character April to look so plain, particularly when Frank describes her as ""a knock out.""I also love Bette Midler's work.  This was her first picture sinceThe Stepford Wives (Full Screen Collector's Edition)in 2004.  Midler has two Oscar nominations for ""For the Boys"" in 1991 & ""The Rose"" in 1979.  She's fun.  She comes on with energy and verve, ""chewing the scenery"" as she describes her high energy style in the DVD interview.  But this does not mix with the sad sack April that Hunt plays.  Even when Hunt makes love, she looks depressed.Colin Firth does a good job of playing Frank Harte who gets a crush on April.  Matthew Broderick signed onto the film as a long-time friend of Hunt's and does well with the comic style.  Ben Shenkman who was nominated for an Emmy & a Golden Globe for ""Angels in America"" in 2003 does a good job as April's brother.  Lynn Cohen who has a small part as Grandma Carrigan inAcross the Universe (Two-Disc Special Edition)plays a feisty mother.  Unusually cast, Salman Rushdie who created such a controversy for his bookThe Satanic Verses: A Novelplays the doctor administering April's sonogram.  John Benjamin Hickey who was inFreedom Writers (Full Screen Edition)plays Bernice's TV producer friend.This film won the Rogue Award at the Ashland Independent Film Festival and the Audience Award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.

1171773,A42QN9MM6LKKM,B001BEK86K,Lee in S.F.,"[0, 0]","Others here have well-reviewed the plot.  While some compare it to a Lifetime effort, I see it as much more.  The screenplay is creative and consistently engaging (a perspective free of Lifetime's formulaic, cliche-filled approach). Also unlike LIfetime, it doesn't exploit tragedy.  Rather, the script is fresh and filled with clever humor.The casting is so good that there's not even a weak minor character in the effort. For starters, Helen Hunt is believable and likable in her haphazard love life and quest to be a mom.  She often blurts the truth of a situation, which adds punch to any interaction.  The story line honors her struggles by showing her as thin and unglamorous, an approach which respects the audience, in my opinion.  Conversely, a disrespectful approach is taken when characters are shown behaving like fools/idiots, along with the embedded message that because these stunted individual are dripping with wealth, the behaviors are ""normal."" (As you breeze through evening TV selections this week, note how your awareness of poor behaviors perhaps is blunted by shows of wealth and/or lavish glamor.)Midler deliciously delights and irritates as the birth mom.  I loved every single scene she appeared in.  In her brief appearance, the adoptive mom is well-defined as controlling but loving.  The brother come across as a quiet ally--always there when Hunt needs him (love brothers like that!). Matthew Broderick's eternal adolescence is so naturally portrayed that (at one point), I had to remind myself that he was playing a role and this wasn't his real personality.  Colin Firth gives a well-nuanced performance as a devoted dad (a real stand-up guy), who is attracted to the Hunt character.Hunt's character's choices were often self-sabotaging, but I cared about her enough to reflect on why she might act like that.  (This means the movie did a good job of fleshing her out, else there'd be nothing to reflect upon.)  Maybe she started life emotionally ungrounded, due to her mother's struggles with her for a year before the baby was adopted.  Maybe this insecurity expanded when she perceived that her adoptive mother didn't look at her with the same loving eyes as she looked at her birth son.  Later, the ground beneath Hunt's feet quakes even further when a series of significant losses befall Hunt in a stunningly brief period of time.In light of the above, I wondered if Hunt's character tended to default to choices which reduced her emotional risk (a form of staying numb).  As for that numbness, Hunt's response to a series of losses was (to me) glossed over and not true to reality.  However, perhaps the intention was to portray Hunt as disconnected from herself.Here's a message I took from the movie.  If life has already dealt some blows, then it's easy to default to  ""known"" pain (pain you know you can live with--even if it reaps no happiness).  It's frightening to then go beyond that, for the unknown pain of pursuing one's dreams, but the human spirit keeps nudging for that anyway.  The movie points to the necessity of a grounded inner life, combined with the support/help of people who want the best for you.  As for defaulting to known pain, it strikes me that it's like treading water.  It offers the illusion that movement is happening, while dulling awareness of zero progression.  In adopting this approach, one never actually drowns.  Yet, ""not drowning"" does not equate to living life fully.  Sorting out these issues became Hunt's challenge.Nearly every movie has daydream scenes, but there weren't many of them for me in this instance.  In particular, I was struck by the scene involving a challenge Midler makes when Hunt (in hospital garb) is ready for a procedure.  The outcome is surprising and meaningful (a welcomed counter-point to the light touch of other scenes).  There, Midler got to signal new depth to her embrace of late in life motherhood.  A second memorable scene takes place in Midler's dressing room, where Hunt (advised by her brother), makes a request.  The conviction Hunt brought was bracing--a welcomed triumph over past efforts of vaguely wobbling towards her goals.Does Hunt ever re-direct enough to make her life work?  Rich with reality doses regarding the messiness of relationships, the movie weaves a believable answer, and is entertaining to boot. I cheerfully recommend it.A final thought: how refreshing it would be if people in real life spoke so constructively, so directly, and with such emotional honesty!",4,Bittersweet/Fun with Threads of Realism,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,4503,"['Others', 'here', 'have', 'well-reviewed', 'plot', 'compare', 'Lifetime', 'effort', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'screenplay', 'creative', 'consistently', 'engaging', 'perspective', 'free', 'Lifetime', 'formulaic', 'cliche-filled', 'approach', 'Also', 'LIfetime', ""n't"", 'exploit', 'tragedy', 'script', 'fresh', 'filled', 'clever', 'humor.The', 'casting', 'so', 'good', 'not', 'even', 'weak', 'minor', 'character', 'effort', 'starters', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'believable', 'likable', 'haphazard', 'love', 'life', 'quest', 'be', 'mom', 'often', 'truth', 'situation', 'punch', 'interaction', 'story', 'line', 'honors', 'struggles', 'showing', 'thin', 'unglamorous', 'approach', 'audience', 'opinion', 'Conversely', 'disrespectful', 'approach', 'taken', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'shown', 'behaving', 'fools/idiots', 'embedded', 'message', 'stunted', 'individual', 'are', 'dripping', 'wealth', 'behaviors', 'are', 'normal', 'breeze', 'evening', 'TV', 'selections', 'week', 'note', 'how', 'awareness', 'poor', 'behaviors', 'perhaps', 'blunted', 'shows', 'wealth', 'and/or', 'lavish', 'glamor', 'Midler', 'deliciously', 'delights', 'irritates', 'birth', 'mom', 'loved', 'single', 'scene', 'appeared', 'brief', 'appearance', 'adoptive', 'mom', 'well-defined', 'controlling', 'loving', 'brother', 'come', 'quiet', 'ally', 'always', 'when', 'Hunt', 'love', 'brothers', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'eternal', 'adolescence', 'so', 'naturally', 'portrayed', 'one', 'point', 'had', 'remind', 'was', 'playing', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'personality', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'well-nuanced', 'performance', 'devoted', 'dad', 'real', 'stand-up', 'guy', 'who', 'attracted', 'Hunt', 'character.Hunt', 'character', 'choices', 'were', 'often', 'self-sabotaging', 'cared', 'enough', 'reflect', 'why', 'might', 'act', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'else', ""'d"", 'be', 'nothing', 'reflect', 'Maybe', 'started', 'life', 'emotionally', 'ungrounded', 'due', 'mother', 'struggles', 'year', 'baby', 'was', 'adopted', 'Maybe', 'insecurity', 'expanded', 'when', 'perceived', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'same', 'loving', 'eyes', 'looked', 'birth', 'son', 'Later', 'ground', 'beneath', 'Hunt', 'feet', 'quakes', 'even', 'further', 'when', 'series', 'significant', 'losses', 'Hunt', 'stunningly', 'brief', 'period', 'time.In', 'light', 'above', 'wondered', 'Hunt', 'character', 'tended', 'default', 'choices', 'reduced', 'emotional', 'risk', 'form', 'staying', 'numb', 'numbness', 'Hunt', 'response', 'series', 'losses', 'was', 'glossed', 'over', 'not', 'true', 'reality', 'However', 'perhaps', 'intention', 'was', 'portray', 'Hunt', 'disconnected', 'herself.Here', 'message', 'took', 'movie', 'life', 'already', 'dealt', 'blows', 'then', 'easy', 'default', 'known', 'pain', 'pain', 'know', 'can', 'live', 'even', 'happiness', 'frightening', 'then', 'go', 'unknown', 'pain', 'pursuing', 'one', 'dreams', 'human', 'spirit', 'keeps', 'nudging', 'anyway', 'movie', 'points', 'necessity', 'grounded', 'inner', 'life', 'combined', 'support/help', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'best', 'defaulting', 'known', 'pain', 'treading', 'water', 'illusion', 'movement', 'happening', 'dulling', 'awareness', 'zero', 'progression', 'adopting', 'approach', 'one', 'never', 'actually', 'drowns', 'not', 'drowning', 'not', 'equate', 'living', 'life', 'fully', 'Sorting', 'issues', 'became', 'Hunt', 'challenge.Nearly', 'movie', 'daydream', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'instance', 'particular', 'was', 'struck', 'scene', 'involving', 'challenge', 'Midler', 'when', 'Hunt', 'hospital', 'garb', 'ready', 'procedure', 'outcome', 'surprising', 'meaningful', 'welcomed', 'counter-point', 'light', 'touch', 'other', 'scenes', 'Midler', 'got', 'signal', 'new', 'depth', 'embrace', 'late', 'life', 'motherhood', 'second', 'memorable', 'scene', 'place', 'Midler', 'dressing', 'room', 'where', 'Hunt', 'advised', 'brother', 'request', 'conviction', 'Hunt', 'brought', 'was', 'bracing', 'welcomed', 'triumph', 'past', 'efforts', 'vaguely', 'wobbling', 'goals.Does', 'Hunt', 'ever', 're-direct', 'enough', 'make', 'life', 'work', 'Rich', 'reality', 'doses', 'regarding', 'messiness', 'relationships', 'movie', 'believable', 'answer', 'entertaining', 'boot', 'cheerfully', 'recommend', 'it.A', 'final', 'thought', 'how', 'refreshing', 'would', 'be', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'spoke', 'so', 'constructively', 'so', 'directly', 'such', 'emotional', 'honesty']",Then She Found Me

1171778,A3NLJZI5NEOT0K,B001BEK86K,"Linda Pagliuco ""katknit""","[2, 2]","Helen Hunt, who has grown as an actor, directed herself in Then She Found Me. Loosely based on the novel of the same title, Ms. Hunt plays April Epner, a woman who has made a late marriage that fails in less than a year. She wants nothing more than to become a mother, and now, at age 39, she fears her chances have slipped away when her husband takes off. No sooner does she find herself abandoned than she receives overtures from her previously unknown birth mother, who hopes to develop a relationship with the daughter she so long ago gave up for adoption. Serendipitously, April meets a divorced man with 2 kids of his own, and the attraction is mutual.The theme of this story has to do with the feelings of an adoptee who wants to give birth to her own child rather than adopt. Naturally, April's emotions are conflicted, and she needs to work them through before she can move forward in her own life. As director, Ms. Hunt admirably prevented this film from becoming maudlin or mawkish. April runs the gamut of emotions, as does her new love interest, Colin Firth, who was unceremoniously dumped by his own wife. Perhaps the most outstanding performance is delivered by Bette Midler, who is larger than life in real life, but restrains herself in the role of April's birth mother, now a spoiled TV celebrity. I don't know if Ms. Hunt is Jewish, but her treatment of the religious overtones in this story is exemplary, also real but restrained. Matthew Broderick does as well as can be expected in the thankless role of April's fickle husband.The main problems with this otherwise charming movie are the rather dull cinematography and some clumsy editing. My recommendation is to read the novel, watch the DVD, but don't expect the same things from them.",4,"Tick, tick, tick",1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,1760,"['Helen', 'Hunt', 'who', 'grown', 'actor', 'directed', 'Then', 'Found', 'Me', 'Loosely', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'Ms.', 'Hunt', 'April', 'Epner', 'woman', 'who', 'made', 'late', 'marriage', 'less', 'year', 'nothing', 'more', 'become', 'mother', 'now', 'age', '39', 'chances', 'have', 'slipped', 'away', 'when', 'husband', 'off', 'sooner', 'find', 'abandoned', 'overtures', 'previously', 'unknown', 'birth', 'mother', 'who', 'develop', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'Serendipitously', 'April', 'divorced', 'man', '2', 'kids', 'own', 'attraction', 'mutual.The', 'theme', 'story', 'do', 'feelings', 'adoptee', 'who', 'give', 'birth', 'own', 'child', 'rather', 'adopt', 'Naturally', 'April', 'emotions', 'are', 'conflicted', 'work', 'can', 'move', 'forward', 'own', 'life', 'director', 'Ms.', 'Hunt', 'admirably', 'prevented', 'film', 'becoming', 'maudlin', 'mawkish', 'April', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'was', 'unceremoniously', 'dumped', 'own', 'wife', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'delivered', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'who', 'larger', 'life', 'real', 'life', 'role', 'April', 'birth', 'mother', 'now', 'spoiled', 'TV', 'celebrity', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Ms.', 'Hunt', 'Jewish', 'treatment', 'religious', 'overtones', 'story', 'exemplary', 'also', 'real', 'restrained', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'thankless', 'role', 'April', 'fickle', 'husband.The', 'main', 'problems', 'otherwise', 'charming', 'movie', 'are', 'rather', 'dull', 'cinematography', 'clumsy', 'editing', 'recommendation', 'read', 'novel', 'watch', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'same', 'things']",Then She Found Me

Bette Midler did a great job of reigning herself in and every other actor is just as great.

As she herself is adopted, she desperately wants to have a child of her own. As in real life, things do not go exactly as planned. This film was fun to watch despite the kleenex staged moments.The thing that struck me the most was the ending. As an adopted child, April was determined to have her own flesh and blood and adoption was not an option. She felt that there was a difference between herself and her mother versus her mother and her biological child. The resolution was a beautiful sight to behold.

He knows she wants a baby, but he isnt sure he is ready for the responsibility.Depressed and alone, she finds solace in a divorced father of two who is semi-angry, semi-depressed, and in a way, ready to move on. She ignores his advances at first, but finally realizes it is time to move on from the husband she believed to be the one.I love Colin Firth in this movie, he has an excellent display of passion and anger at each event that happens to him. He seems to be a mate of challenge for our heroine, but at the same time the potential for a better future.Bette Midler was also equally superb. She played the crazy, sometimes destructive liar pretty well. She is very self centered, and changes the subject frequently, but you cannot help but resist her.Excellent from all angles, a must see.

1171800,AV252YPWNODEV,B001BEK86K,M. Oliver,"[3, 3]","I am a guy and I often like ""women's"" movies - either carefree chick flicks, sappy romances, or on occasion, serious movies with really defective people - e.g. like Halle Berry inMonster's Ball.  Knowing this movie was going to one of these, I was astonished how far from good this movie was with Helen Hunt and Colin Firth in it - I had expected a great movie - but it was all I could do to watch it.  The story line is fairly preposterous and doubles down later to sheer incredulity.Hunt's character is a 39 year old woman who teaches Elementary school children.  Helen Hunt is a beautiful woman but the make up/style in this movie makes her look like a disheveled late 40's woman who has bulimia, she really looks awful in almost every scene (very few beautiful women can pull this off, unfortunately Helen Hunt does not do it here).  We find out she was adopted by a Jewish family in some odd out-of-place family scenes.  She marries a Jewish man (played by Matthew Broderick, who was terribly miscast in this role).  That marriage ends quickly and very awkwardly.  The rest of the movie is a disjointed plot/subplot story . . . Hunt's character's actual mother (played by Bette Midler), who is some kind of TV talk show host, appears out of no where, and wants a mother-daughter relationship with her 39 year old daughter.  The other story line is another very awkward love story with Firth's character, a parent of a student in Hunt's class.  Firth's character has odd habits - never explained or tied into anything (did his wife die? leave him for another man? woman? why, he seems almost perfect?)Hunt's character starts dating Firth's character almost immediately after her marriage ends.  She finds out she is pregnant (by the ex-husband, they had awkward in-the-kitchen sex the night he left??) and then the preposterous part of the story really kicks into gear.  She goes to the doctor first with the ex husband and Firth's character; later after a fight, her brother from her adopted family comes with her, the ex husband brings a date?  In between, the ex-husband asks for a ride home from a doctor appointment, and Hunt's character has sex with him in broad daylight in the back seat of her car.  (an awkward, silly scene)In the sub story, Hunt's character does not believe her newly found mother (who appears in many scenes with a guy whose point/role is never explained).  I could not here explain fully how bizarre most of this plot is . . . there is a point that Hunt's character does a DNA test from stolen hair, and then blackmails the mother to pay for fertility drugs after she has a miscarriage.  This just seemed implausible from such a meek character.  The mother lies to Hunt's character about all kinds of things, and then starts stalking her daughter after the lies turn to shunning.  The whole subplot just was uninteresting.  The movie ends abruptly when it appears that she adopts a child instead of having one.Hunt plays her character very dead pan throughout the movie - as if her life was pointless - and in the end, I just did not care about her life, any more than she did in the movie.To the extent this movie was trying to be ""realistic"" in portraying life, in my view it failed miserably.  The character interactions are very disjointed and often unexplained.  Some scenes looked as if they were cut in for some point that was never set up (for example, Midler's character comments on a 50 year old guy's but, and then later might be sleeping with him, but who is he, why? it just made no sense - we had already figured out she was a narcissist).  People do not pick up a date and first go to an ex-wife's ultrasound, unless the date is a prostitute.  This movie just does not come off at all realistic.  Or entertaining.If you like really depressing movies with characters that meander through life, do pointless things, interact in unrealistic manners, and then the movie just ends . . . then you might like this.  Otherwise, do yourself a favor and spend 2 hours doing something else more life enriching . . .",2,"Moribund unrealistic story, painful to watch even if you like these movies",1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,4052,"['am', 'guy', 'often', 'women', 'movies', 'carefree', 'chick', 'flicks', 'sappy', 'romances', 'occasion', 'serious', 'movies', 'really', 'defective', 'people', 'e.g', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'inMonster', 'Ball', 'Knowing', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'one', 'was', 'astonished', 'how', 'far', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'had', 'expected', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'could', 'do', 'watch', 'story', 'line', 'fairly', 'preposterous', 'down', 'later', 'sheer', 'incredulity.Hunt', 'character', '39', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'Elementary', 'school', 'children', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'make', 'up/style', 'movie', 'look', 'disheveled', 'late', '40', 'woman', 'who', 'bulimia', 'really', 'awful', 'almost', 'scene', 'very', 'few', 'beautiful', 'women', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'unfortunately', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'not', 'do', 'here', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'adopted', 'Jewish', 'family', 'odd', 'out-of-place', 'family', 'scenes', 'Jewish', 'man', 'played', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'who', 'was', 'terribly', 'miscast', 'role', 'marriage', 'quickly', 'very', 'awkwardly', 'rest', 'movie', 'disjointed', 'plot/subplot', 'story', 'Hunt', 'character', 'actual', 'mother', 'played', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'who', 'kind', 'TV', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'where', 'mother-daughter', 'relationship', '39', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'other', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'awkward', 'love', 'story', 'Firth', 'character', 'parent', 'student', 'Hunt', 'class', 'Firth', 'character', 'odd', 'habits', 'never', 'explained', 'tied', 'anything', 'did', 'wife', 'die', 'leave', 'man', 'woman', 'why', 'almost', 'perfect', 'Hunt', 'character', 'dating', 'Firth', 'character', 'almost', 'immediately', 'marriage', 'pregnant', 'ex-husband', 'had', 'awkward', 'in-the-kitchen', 'sex', 'night', 'left', 'then', 'preposterous', 'part', 'story', 'really', 'gear', 'doctor', 'first', 'ex', 'husband', 'Firth', 'character', 'later', 'fight', 'brother', 'adopted', 'family', 'ex', 'husband', 'date', 'ex-husband', 'ride', 'home', 'doctor', 'appointment', 'Hunt', 'character', 'sex', 'broad', 'daylight', 'back', 'seat', 'car', 'awkward', 'silly', 'scene', 'sub', 'story', 'Hunt', 'character', 'not', 'believe', 'newly', 'found', 'mother', 'who', 'many', 'scenes', 'guy', 'point/role', 'never', 'explained', 'could', 'not', 'here', 'explain', 'fully', 'how', 'bizarre', 'most', 'plot', 'point', 'Hunt', 'character', 'DNA', 'test', 'stolen', 'hair', 'then', 'mother', 'pay', 'fertility', 'drugs', 'miscarriage', 'just', 'seemed', 'implausible', 'such', 'meek', 'character', 'mother', 'Hunt', 'character', 'kinds', 'things', 'then', 'stalking', 'daughter', 'lies', 'turn', 'shunning', 'whole', 'subplot', 'just', 'was', 'uninteresting', 'movie', 'abruptly', 'when', 'child', 'instead', 'having', 'one.Hunt', 'character', 'very', 'dead', 'pan', 'movie', 'life', 'was', 'pointless', 'end', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'life', 'more', 'did', 'movie.To', 'extent', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'realistic', 'portraying', 'life', 'view', 'failed', 'miserably', 'character', 'interactions', 'are', 'very', 'disjointed', 'often', 'unexplained', 'scenes', 'looked', 'were', 'cut', 'point', 'was', 'never', 'set', 'up', 'example', 'Midler', 'character', 'comments', '50', 'year', 'old', 'guy', 'then', 'later', 'might', 'be', 'sleeping', 'who', 'why', 'just', 'made', 'sense', 'had', 'already', 'figured', 'out', 'was', 'narcissist', 'People', 'do', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'date', 'first', 'go', 'ex-wife', 'ultrasound', 'date', 'prostitute', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'realistic', 'entertaining.If', 'really', 'depressing', 'movies', 'characters', 'meander', 'life', 'do', 'pointless', 'things', 'interact', 'unrealistic', 'manners', 'then', 'movie', 'just', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'Otherwise', 'do', 'favor', 'spend', '2', 'hours', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'more', 'life', 'enriching']",Then She Found Me

She wants a career, a marriage, a family and happy ever after. And, then one day it all falls apart.April Epner, played by Helen Hunt teaches kindergarten, her husband played by Matthew Broderick is also a teacher. As we meet them they are having a Jewish religious holiday in the hospital with April's adopted mother. It is easily apparent that relations between April and her adopted mother are not all they should be. That night, April's husband tells her he loves someone else, and before he leaves they have hasty sex on the kitchen floor. April who is heartbroken faces the world in a haze, and on top of it all her adoptive mother dies. Life goes on, her friends and in particular her brother are her support. One day out of the blue a man comes to her school to ask her to meet with her birth mother, Beatrice, played by Bette Midler. Beatirce is an over the top local talk-show personality. On the same day that April meets her mother she also meets one of her student's father. They are both instantly hooked. They dance around having a date for awhile, but after a bit they decide their love is real. The relationship with real mom is up and down and April reaches a true conundrum.This could be a very sappy film, but Helen Hunt's excellent direction saves it. Helen wears not much make-up, she looks pale and thin. Her new boyfriend, played by Colin Firth is rugged, a nice term for a little fat, solvely dad. He is all taken up in caring for his two young children, they were all left by his wife, their mother who is traveling through Europe with a new lover. Beatrice is as she should be, funny, really over the top as only Bette Midler can be, but filled with common sense and seems to instinctively knows how to behave. Matthew Broderick is a young mommy's boy and someone to avoid at all costs. The storyline may be trite to some, but I think it was well written and superbly acted. April's gynecologist is Salman Rushdie, for gosh sakes!This is a film that all women will appreciate and men if they are really men.

Zwick,"[0, 0]","Played by first-time director Helen Hunt, April is a 39-year-old elementary school teacher in Brooklyn whose biological clock has been ticking so loudly it's been keeping her up at night.  But that's just the beginning of her woes.  Her husband of just a few months (Matthew Broderick) has left her; her adoptive mother has just died; and a crazy lady (Bette Midler) - a local TV talk show host - is claiming to be her biological mother (with Steve McQueen as her father, no less).  Then, just as her midlife crisis is coming to a boil, in steps a conveniently abandoned father of two (Colin Firth) - one of whom is April's pupil - to sweep her off her feet, though he comes with his own share of problems as well.Though ""Then She Found Me"" is not quite as shopworn and trite as that synopsis may make it sound, it's still an uneasy mixture of insightful drama and plot-tweaking contrivance.  In fact, the Alice Arlen/Victor Levin/Helen Hunt screenplay, based on the 1990 novel by Elinor Lipman, tries so hard to be unconventional that it often winds up feeling fake.  On the positive side, though, the acting is good (why have we seen so little of Hunt on screen since she won her Oscar fourteen years ago?); the characters skew a little older than your typical romantic comedy figures; the story ends on a tremendously sweet note, and there's just enough genuine humor and charm in the movie to make it worth a look-see.One side note: the movie makes a continuity error by claiming that April was conceived in 1966 when McQueen was off in China filming ""The Sand Pebbles,"" but later we're told she was conceived when her mother was at a drive-in showing of ""Bullitt,"" which wasn't even released until 1968!",3,Hunt shines in mixed-bag directorial debut,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,1708,"['Played', 'first-time', 'director', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'April', '39-year-old', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'Brooklyn', 'biological', 'clock', 'been', 'ticking', 'so', 'loudly', 'been', 'keeping', 'up', 'night', 'just', 'beginning', 'woes', 'husband', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'left', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'just', 'died', 'crazy', 'lady', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'local', 'TV', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'claiming', 'be', 'biological', 'mother', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'father', 'less', 'Then', 'just', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'coming', 'boil', 'steps', 'conveniently', 'abandoned', 'father', 'two', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'one', 'whom', 'April', 'pupil', 'sweep', 'feet', 'own', 'share', 'problems', 'Then', 'Found', 'Me', 'not', 'quite', 'shopworn', 'trite', 'synopsis', 'may', 'make', 'still', 'uneasy', 'mixture', 'insightful', 'drama', 'plot-tweaking', 'contrivance', 'fact', 'Alice', 'Arlen/Victor', 'Levin/Helen', 'Hunt', 'screenplay', 'based', '1990', 'novel', 'Elinor', 'Lipman', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'unconventional', 'often', 'up', 'feeling', 'fake', 'positive', 'side', 'though', 'acting', 'good', 'why', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'little', 'Hunt', 'screen', 'won', 'Oscar', 'fourteen', 'years', 'ago', 'characters', 'skew', 'little', 'older', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'figures', 'story', 'tremendously', 'sweet', 'note', 'just', 'enough', 'genuine', 'humor', 'charm', 'movie', 'make', 'look-see.One', 'side', 'note', 'movie', 'continuity', 'error', 'claiming', 'April', 'was', 'conceived', '1966', 'when', 'McQueen', 'was', 'off', 'China', 'filming', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'later', ""'re"", 'told', 'was', 'conceived', 'when', 'mother', 'was', 'drive-in', 'showing', 'Bullitt', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'released', '1968']",Then She Found Me

I have little to add, but do recommend Then She Found Me, if the viewer understands that this is not a mainstream Hollywood romance. Those seeking yet another reprisal of a Colin Firth as Darcy to a modern day Elizabeth Bennett treatment probably will be disappointed. The film has many layers, with a primary focus on betrayal, not just formulaic romantic love. I read some complaints that reviewers didn't find the characters likable and found Ms. Hunt not glamorous enough. One of the things I enjoyed most was more realistic, complex portrayal of human foibles than we're often given in film today. I laughed when I read the comments about Ms. Hunt's appearance, because this basically is what you look like when it all comes crashing down around you. You can relate to these characters. They are quite imperfectly human.I like it. This is a film for adults, which is a such rarity these days. There is a lot of heart to the story and its characters. Lots of lovely subtleties in scenery, music, costuming, etc. The cast is superb, comedy is generally smartly written and well delivered. Formulaic aspects to some story lines, but it was thought-provoking overall, and well worth viewing.I'm a fan of Helen Hunt as an actress and am proud to see such a strong directorial debut. I hope she continues. I really recommend checking out the Special Features section of the DVD, especially the interviews and featurette. Those interested in film making will enjoy Ms. Hunt's commentary, much of which focuses on the creative detail of telling the story, especially with little budget and limited time.I think this film deserved more of a chance than it got. It's not a ""chick flick,"" fluffy romance or Lifetime movie. It's an adult comedy-drama with a thought-provoking theme and wonderful performances.

I loved the book,  a tender, poignant journey of love in which April,  albeit unwillingly, learns to accept the difficult person who gave birth to her and slowly learns the devastating truth of her past.  But Elinor Lipman says she does not mind the fact that Helen Hunt basically took her book and scissored away everything but a few names and the center plot of the book,  and came up with this idiotic film about ticking biological clocks instead.But I have to wonder,  how can she not mind?  This hash of a movie bears little resemblance to what it was based on,  so why did Helen Hunt not just find someone to write a new screenplay about a woman who wanted to have a baby?  Why did she take a brilliant story,  with fabulous characters,  and turn it into this really rather dumb movie?In the book,  Bernice is difficult but ultimately complex and suprisingly sympathetic by the end,  but Bette Midler's Bernice is just a cardboard cutout of the same person.  And it's a shame,  because Midler would have played the ""real"" Bernice beautifully if she had had a decent script to work with.  And in the book,  April is a bit uptight,  but not the brittle, haggard neurotic that is portrayed here.  And while Colin Firth is, as usual,  great to look at,  his character is poorly written as well.  The male ""hero"" of the book,  Dwight,  and his relationship with April,  are so appealing,  that I cannot believe these two annoying men and their shallow interactions with the main character are supposed to replace that.I did give this movie two stars because I liked Salman Rushdie playing the part of the doctor and I liked the sweet little twist at the end.  But the whole time I watched it,  I couldn't help thinking of the wonderful book at home on my shelf and asking,  ""Why,  oh why,  did someone have to screw it up so very badly?""",2,How can Elinor Lipman not mind this?,1224720000,"10 23, 2008",2008,1918,"['Ok', 'tried', 'really', 'really', 'tried', 'not', 'compare', 'movie', 'book', 'loved', 'book', 'tender', 'poignant', 'journey', 'love', 'April', 'unwillingly', 'accept', 'difficult', 'person', 'who', 'gave', 'birth', 'slowly', 'devastating', 'truth', 'past', 'Elinor', 'Lipman', 'not', 'mind', 'fact', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'basically', 'took', 'book', 'scissored', 'away', 'everything', 'few', 'names', 'center', 'plot', 'book', 'came', 'up', 'idiotic', 'film', 'ticking', 'biological', 'clocks', 'instead.But', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'mind', 'hash', 'movie', 'little', 'resemblance', 'what', 'was', 'based', 'so', 'why', 'did', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'not', 'just', 'find', 'someone', 'write', 'new', 'screenplay', 'woman', 'who', 'wanted', 'have', 'baby', 'Why', 'did', 'take', 'brilliant', 'story', 'fabulous', 'characters', 'turn', 'really', 'rather', 'dumb', 'movie', 'book', 'Bernice', 'difficult', 'ultimately', 'complex', 'suprisingly', 'sympathetic', 'end', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Bernice', 'just', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'same', 'person', 'shame', 'Midler', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'real', 'Bernice', 'beautifully', 'had', 'had', 'decent', 'script', 'work', 'book', 'April', 'bit', 'uptight', 'not', 'brittle', 'haggard', 'neurotic', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'usual', 'great', 'look', 'character', 'poorly', 'written', 'as', 'well', 'male', 'hero', 'book', 'Dwight', 'relationship', 'April', 'are', 'so', 'appealing', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'two', 'annoying', 'men', 'shallow', 'interactions', 'main', 'character', 'are', 'supposed', 'replace', 'that.I', 'did', 'give', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'liked', 'Salman', 'Rushdie', 'playing', 'part', 'doctor', 'liked', 'sweet', 'little', 'twist', 'end', 'whole', 'time', 'watched', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'wonderful', 'book', 'home', 'shelf', 'asking', 'Why', 'oh', 'why', 'did', 'someone', 'have', 'screw', 'up', 'so', 'very', 'badly']",Then She Found Me

Bette Midler's character was good but the lie on top of lie sort of lead the story down a disappointing path.  Helen Hunt's performance was depressing and her clothing and make up choices were way too frumpy for a lady her age.  It made the story that less believeable.  There could have been chemistry with Colin Firth and his two daughters - but that never seemed to take off either!  Not sure what the point was suppose to be - was it to develop a relationship with your birth mother - to move on from your lazy husband - to have a healthy romantic relationship with the new man and embrace his children?  Even though we are rooting for her and Colin Firth, the ending didn't seem to be realistic either.
