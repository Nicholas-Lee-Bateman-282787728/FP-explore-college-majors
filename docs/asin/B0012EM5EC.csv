1136734,A1A692B4XLFOLL,B0012EM5EC,"A. Courie ""Treb""","[2, 2]","""Cheers"" is my favorite television show of all time and one of the all-time best shows, but the show was starting to get stale by the ninth season.  Still, a lesser season of Cheers is a great season.Sam is back in charge of Cheers in this season and things feel normal after a few seasons of corporate ownership.  It also featured the 200th show (hosted by John McLaughlin) and such classic sub-plots as Frasier reading Dickens to the Cheers gang and the short-term bartender Earl.  As far as characters, the ninth season saw the introduction of Henri and John Allen Hill and the increased prominence of Paul Krapence (the same actor had a different name in earlier seasons).  It also saw the (temporary) end of Robin Colcord as a featured character.(One other note: Although many have complained about the new packaging, I prefer the slick and compact packaging of all give discs in one normal-sized DVD case to the large and bulky packaging of the previous seasons.)Cheers was beginning to lose its luster, partly because Sam and Rebecca's relationship had ""matured"" to the point where they were true friends, but it still remained a fantastic show with a special cast.  Although the overall quality of the show had begun to decline by this season, there are too many great jokes, episodes, and characters to give it any less than five stars.",5,"Not One of the Best Seasons, But It's Cheers!",1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,1345,"['Cheers', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', 'time', 'one', 'all-time', 'best', 'shows', 'show', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'stale', 'ninth', 'season', 'Still', 'lesser', 'season', 'Cheers', 'great', 'season.Sam', 'back', 'charge', 'Cheers', 'season', 'things', 'feel', 'normal', 'few', 'seasons', 'corporate', 'ownership', 'also', 'featured', '200th', 'show', 'hosted', 'John', 'McLaughlin', 'such', 'classic', 'sub-plots', 'Frasier', 'reading', 'Dickens', 'Cheers', 'gang', 'short-term', 'bartender', 'Earl', 'As', 'far', 'characters', 'ninth', 'season', 'saw', 'introduction', 'Henri', 'John', 'Allen', 'Hill', 'increased', 'prominence', 'Paul', 'Krapence', 'same', 'actor', 'had', 'different', 'name', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'also', 'saw', 'temporary', 'end', 'Robin', 'Colcord', 'featured', 'character', 'One', 'other', 'note', 'many', 'have', 'complained', 'new', 'packaging', 'prefer', 'slick', 'compact', 'packaging', 'give', 'discs', 'one', 'normal-sized', 'DVD', 'case', 'large', 'bulky', 'packaging', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Cheers', 'was', 'beginning', 'lose', 'luster', 'partly', 'Sam', 'Rebecca', 'relationship', 'had', 'matured', 'point', 'where', 'were', 'true', 'friends', 'still', 'remained', 'fantastic', 'show', 'special', 'cast', 'overall', 'quality', 'show', 'had', 'begun', 'decline', 'season', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'great', 'jokes', 'episodes', 'characters', 'give', 'less', 'five', 'stars']",Cheers: Season 9

Percell,"[3, 9]","Like most everybody else, the packaging was an issue at first, but frankly the new packaging takes up a lot less space on an already crowded shelf, so no problem. My gripe (and it is a BIG one) is the fact that these episodes were edited from the originals. Don't believe me? Look on the back of the case in the little rectangular box at the bottom and it says so right there. Had I known this, I would never have ordered it, as much as I love this show. What the idiots at CBS Video apparently don't understand is that the whole point of buying complete seasons is that so we can see the complete episodes as they were intended to be seen, not some hacked up versions by some no-talent hack who has nothing to do with the show in the first place.

1136738,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0012EM5EC,calvinnme,"[11, 19]","It's been awhile since Paramount released season eight of Cheers, and I'd even heard that due to poor sales on previous seasons that Paramount would not be releasing any more seasons. Thus I was very happy to see season nine come up for preorder, since it really is essential. It's not that seasons ten and eleven are not essential, but you are really left hanging if you only have Cheers up through season eight. There are SPOILERS AHEAD, primarily from season eight.At the conclusion of season eight, Rebecca's boyfriend, billionaire Robin Colcord, had been stealing information from the company for which Rebecca worked. Robin cleverly silenced Rebecca by promising to marry her. Sam, fearing Rebecca would wind up being implicated in Robin's criminal schemes, went to Rebecca's company and uncovered the plot himself. Robin responded by wiring his money to Switzerland and fleeing the country. The good news is that Sam was rewarded by the company by having his bar returned to his ownership. Likewise, Rebecca was fired, not because of Robin's insider trading but because ""they never much cared for her work"", to quote Woody. Rebecca turns to Sam for comfort which turns into a passionate encounter when a penitent Robin suddenly returns, seeking the love and forgiveness of Rebecca and finds...Thus begins season nine.Season nine deals with what exactly it is that Robin saw when season eight ended, how Robin deals with incarceration, how Sam and Rebecca deal with the new standing of their personal and professional relationship, and how Rebecca reacts to the idea of marrying a now bankrupt Robin when he is paroled at midseason. To top it all off, Sam is beginning to really enjoy babysitting Frasier and Lillith's son to the point of making a pest of himself. Sam decides that a child is something he would really like to have in his life, and with the prompting of Elvis' ghost decides on a likely candidate for a mother in the season finale.Although still funny, the earlier seasons of Cheers haven't aged that well. However, season nine is recent enough (1990-1991) that it should still hold up. It's not necessary to have seen the first five seasons (1982-1987) to enjoy season nine, since ""The Diane Chambers Years"" are practically a different show from the last six seasons, but you should have seen seasons six through eight to appreciate what is going on in season nine.",5,A needed addition to the Cheers' series DVDs,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,2389,"['been', 'awhile', 'Paramount', 'released', 'season', 'eight', 'Cheers', ""'d"", 'even', 'heard', 'due', 'poor', 'sales', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Paramount', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'releasing', 'more', 'seasons', 'Thus', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'see', 'season', 'nine', 'come', 'up', 'preorder', 'really', 'essential', 'not', 'seasons', 'ten', 'eleven', 'are', 'not', 'essential', 'are', 'really', 'left', 'hanging', 'only', 'have', 'Cheers', 'up', 'season', 'eight', 'are', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'primarily', 'season', 'conclusion', 'season', 'eight', 'Rebecca', 'boyfriend', 'billionaire', 'Robin', 'Colcord', 'had', 'been', 'stealing', 'information', 'company', 'Rebecca', 'worked', 'Robin', 'cleverly', 'silenced', 'Rebecca', 'promising', 'marry', 'Sam', 'fearing', 'Rebecca', 'would', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'implicated', 'Robin', 'criminal', 'schemes', 'went', 'Rebecca', 'company', 'uncovered', 'plot', 'Robin', 'responded', 'wiring', 'money', 'Switzerland', 'fleeing', 'country', 'good', 'news', 'Sam', 'was', 'rewarded', 'company', 'having', 'bar', 'returned', 'ownership', 'Likewise', 'Rebecca', 'was', 'fired', 'not', 'Robin', 'insider', 'trading', 'never', 'much', 'cared', 'work', 'quote', 'Woody', 'Rebecca', 'Sam', 'comfort', 'passionate', 'encounter', 'when', 'penitent', 'Robin', 'suddenly', 'seeking', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'Rebecca', 'finds', 'Thus', 'season', 'nine.Season', 'nine', 'deals', 'what', 'exactly', 'Robin', 'saw', 'when', 'season', 'eight', 'ended', 'how', 'Robin', 'deals', 'incarceration', 'how', 'Sam', 'Rebecca', 'deal', 'new', 'standing', 'personal', 'professional', 'relationship', 'how', 'Rebecca', 'idea', 'marrying', 'now', 'bankrupt', 'Robin', 'when', 'paroled', 'midseason', 'top', 'off', 'Sam', 'beginning', 'really', 'enjoy', 'babysitting', 'Frasier', 'Lillith', 'son', 'point', 'making', 'pest', 'Sam', 'child', 'something', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'have', 'life', 'prompting', 'Elvis', 'ghost', 'decides', 'likely', 'candidate', 'mother', 'season', 'finale.Although', 'still', 'funny', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Cheers', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well', 'However', 'season', 'nine', 'recent', 'enough', '1990-1991', 'should', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'not', 'necessary', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', '1982-1987', 'enjoy', 'season', 'nine', 'Diane', 'Chambers', 'Years', 'are', 'practically', 'different', 'show', 'last', 'six', 'seasons', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'seasons', 'six', 'eight', 'appreciate', 'what', 'going', 'season', 'nine']",Cheers: Season 9
1136739,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B0012EM5EC,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[1, 1]","I love cheers. I watched it since it first came out when I was 11. It was the first show I found and watched on my own. Most times I just watched what everyone else watched. So I would buy this set no matter what. I do not like the fact that episodes are edited, and there are times when I can tell. My memories are not perfect but I always know when something is missing/changed. But, I was worried they were not going to release any more seasons, so I am glad just to have it. As for the packaging I actually like it. One reason is that it's easier to keep safe without looking frayed or dirty. Second, it takes up less space. Though I wish they would have started this way. I always hate having series in two different type packages. I really do think they needed to add more special features though. This show is too classic to not have cast interviews or whatever. However, I will say when they change the cases like this they should offer retro-fitted cases for previous seasons (at a low cost). I remember when they changed the cases for the Simpsons they gave you a number you could call in order to get a normal case (to match previous seasons) of course it was Homer's voice, and he gave you the link and derided you for your choice for of a plain case lol, but at least they gave you the option. Anyway, I would recommend Cheers to anyone, as for people who say that Cheers was losing it's luster, I'd like to add that even cheers' worst episode was and is better than most other shows best episode. The writing and acting/chemistry was top notch. Something you rarely find on tv. Especially now in the day of reality TV. do you think Kim Kardashian could make it in a world where you'd actually have to do work and say things that are actually clever?

However - this may not be all Paramounts fault. Not that long ago, the wonderful folks at RIAA and various record companies sued people who used ""Samples"" of their music - usually 10 - 15 second snippets that wound up on songs by Chemical Brothers and other sampler groups - but also on TV shows.Essentially, our legal system decided that this was ""copyright infringement"" and ordered that anybody who continues to use or release these snippets pay royalties. Yes - it's probably the same people who do not want to let us make copies of our CD's or DVD's for protection because ""they are very resiliant"" - right.Anyhow, my point is that as a result of this ruling, it may have become cost prohibitive to obtain the rights to use these snippets, and may also explain to long delay between season 8 and season 9 coming out. Sure, Paramount might have been able to get the rights - but at what cost? Longer waits, higher prices; or possibly just the decision not to release the final 3 seasons.So, we are stuck suffering because of the record execs, but there are still some good laughs to be had from the season, even if it has been butchered.",5,Music changes might not be due to Paramount,1220486400,"09 4, 2008",2008,1236,"['agree', 'who', 'are', 'upset', 'changes', 'series', 'apparently', 'Season', '10', 'However', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Paramounts', 'fault', 'Not', 'long', 'ago', 'wonderful', 'folks', 'RIAA', 'various', 'record', 'companies', 'sued', 'people', 'who', 'used', 'Samples', 'music', 'usually', '10', '15', 'second', 'snippets', 'wound', 'up', 'songs', 'Chemical', 'Brothers', 'other', 'sampler', 'groups', 'also', 'TV', 'shows.Essentially', 'legal', 'system', 'decided', 'was', 'copyright', 'infringement', 'ordered', 'anybody', 'who', 'use', 'release', 'snippets', 'pay', 'royalties', 'Yes', 'probably', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'let', 'make', 'copies', 'CD', 'DVD', 'protection', 'are', 'very', 'resiliant', 'right.Anyhow', 'point', 'result', 'ruling', 'may', 'have', 'become', 'cost', 'prohibitive', 'obtain', 'rights', 'use', 'snippets', 'may', 'also', 'explain', 'long', 'delay', 'season', '8', 'season', '9', 'coming', 'out', 'Sure', 'Paramount', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'rights', 'what', 'cost', 'Longer', 'higher', 'prices', 'possibly', 'just', 'decision', 'not', 'release', 'final', '3', 'seasons.So', 'are', 'stuck', 'suffering', 'record', 'execs', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'season', 'even', 'been', 'butchered']",Cheers: Season 9

Many of the characters have progressed more, others, not at all. Sam and Rebecca are by this time more or less a distraction, while Woody and specially Frasier go from strenghts to strenghts.My beef with this Region 1 DVD is this. After waiting for a couple of years now, for the the 9th season to come out, I was extremly angry to see how this disc looked. After 8 seasons of Cheers stuck in the same ""digi packs"", cardboard sleeves with a fold out housing inside, the parent company has changed the format! All the discs (5 in total this time) are stuck inside a single disc DVD case just like the ones from Bossom Buddies and Family Ties. So now you'll have the complete Frasier looking uniform and nice next to Cheers, the mixed up series. Which may or may not annoy you enough, like having a piece of sand in your eye, so when they re-release the whole series on, lets say Blu-Ray, you feel compelled to get it all again. Maybe.Just a warning.
