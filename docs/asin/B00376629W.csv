1329456,A1GRN460CMF38N,B00376629W,E. Lee,"[2, 3]","Very interesting story.  Heard about the Queen Seondeok but didn't know much about her.  I'm glad they're branching out and exploring historical characters outside of Chosun Dynasty.  Overall, I liked the story and the characters but it's not the best historical drama I've seen.  So here are my complaints.1.  Like a lot of Korean dramas, this one also relies too much on misunderstandings and lies to move the plot forward.  When someone asks you if you've ever lied to him/her, that's because they probably think you did.  So don't lie and say ""No, I've never lied to you.""  Anyhow, so the plot moves along... lies then misunderstanding... people don't talk when they need to... misunderstanding...  People go from trusting to not trusting and then everything's well and then something else makes them distrust each other.. happens a lot so fast back and forth...  sigh...2.  The story took place in ~600 AD.  That's 1,400 years ago.  I'm not sure what kind of language they used back then and I'm sure nobody really knows.  However, I'm pretty sure they talked very differently than now.  I'm really surprised that the writers and actors made no significant effort to change the way they talk and interact.  It's very casual and 21st century.  It's not a deal breaker but personally, I thought it took away from the setting and overall atmosphere of the show.3.  It goes back and forth between historical periodic drama, comedy and some weird kung fu.  They tried too hard to be everything.  Once again, I felt like it's just too 21st century.",3,Seondeok,1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,1547,"['Very', 'interesting', 'story', 'Heard', 'Queen', 'Seondeok', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'re"", 'branching', 'out', 'exploring', 'historical', 'characters', 'Chosun', 'Dynasty', 'Overall', 'liked', 'story', 'characters', 'not', 'best', 'historical', 'drama', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'So', 'here', 'are', 'complaints.1', 'lot', 'Korean', 'dramas', 'one', 'also', 'too', 'much', 'misunderstandings', 'move', 'plot', 'forward', 'When', 'someone', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'lied', 'him/her', 'probably', 'think', 'did', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'lie', 'say', 'No', ""'ve"", 'never', 'lied', 'Anyhow', 'plot', 'moves', 'then', 'misunderstanding', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'when', 'need', 'misunderstanding', 'People', 'go', 'trusting', 'not', 'trusting', 'then', 'everything', 'well', 'then', 'something', 'else', 'distrust', 'other..', 'lot', 'fast', 'back', 'forth', 'sigh', '2', 'story', 'took', 'place', '~600', 'AD', '1,400', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'kind', 'language', 'used', 'back', 'then', ""'m"", 'sure', 'nobody', 'really', 'However', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'talked', 'very', 'differently', 'now', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'writers', 'actors', 'made', 'significant', 'effort', 'change', 'way', 'talk', 'interact', 'very', 'casual', '21st', 'century', 'not', 'deal', 'breaker', 'personally', 'thought', 'took', 'away', 'setting', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'show.3', 'back', 'forth', 'historical', 'periodic', 'drama', 'comedy', 'weird', 'kung', 'fu', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'everything', 'Once', 'again', 'felt', 'just', 'too', '21st', 'century']",The Great Queen Seondeok Complete Set - Episodes 1-62 (13 Discs)

1329460,A1RP2Y86TDQ95V,B00376629W,"Keith J. Williams ""the music man""","[4, 4]","The great queen seundook is a great series.  Released after Jumong and the King & I, it is still one of the best of the three.  I got hooked on these Korean tele-novellas while on vacation in the Philipines.  But since I could not understand Tagolog that well, I vowed to get these shows if they were available in the states.  And to my luck, they were.  If you like hisory and great adventure and lots of schemes, these are the series to watch.  The Great Queen Seundook is about a girl who is abandonded at birth by the king due to aan age old prophecy.  Raised by her maid, she encounters her older sister, the princess Cheonmyoung, and is escorted back to the castle under an assumed name Doekman.  Though unaware of her royal status or her real self, she is raissed as one of the Hwarang (palace guards).  After finding out about herself, she vows to the take the throne and destroy Misil, who had her sister Princess Cheonmyoung assassinated, the woman who has no passion of anyone except for herself, (she even abandoned her own son who inevitably helps Doekman get the throne.)  I am probably one of the few white people who loves these type of shows and probably always will.  You could say this is the way to learn Korean from these shows, as Sho-gun was for America was for learning Japanese!!!  These shows are truly great in characters, action, comedy & martial scenes, which even make the great Jackie Chan & Jet Li look bad.  If you are a person who likes adventure, drama, great cinematography and great battle scenes and if you don't mind reading subtitles, these series, Ju-Mong, The King & I, & The Great Queen Seondook are truly worth having in your collection and knowing a little bit about Korean history.
