494073,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B000006GDQ,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[12, 12]","Update: Thankfully, a DVD has been released for this movie in the United States so it's finally part of my DVD collection.I have long been a fan of this entertaining 1970s caper movie and so, even though I am a DVD devotee, I had no qualms about picking up a VHS copy.  Though, a region-free DVD player comes in handy for movies like THE FOURTH PROTOCOL, HIGH ROAD TO CHINA, WHEN EIGHT BELLS TOLL and SILVER BEARS, I have yet to find a region where this movie is released.However I do have a qualm. It appears that the quirky dry humor laden internal commentary by the lead Charles Grodin is missing from this VHS tape. This is an essential part of what makes this movie so engaging because  although this movie is not filmed strictly as a comedy (except for the last 20 minutes or so), Grodins commentary kept the atmosphere  light and  carefree even in the moments of high-tension.This movie also benefits from a truly amazing high-caliber cast. Featured alongside Grodin is Candice Bergen (later to find fame as Murphy Brown), James Mason, Trevor Howard and Sir John Gielgud. Given this cast and the clever humor and plot it really is astounding that this movie has yet to find a DVD release.The movie centers around small-time diamond trader Howard R. Chesser who suddenly finds himself negotiating a million-pound deal (a lot more in 1974 than it sounds  today). Treated with contempt by the Diamond Exchange located at 11 Harrowhouse (which carefully controls the flow of diamonds and stockpiles tons of them in order to maintain their value), Chesser jumps at the chance to snub his nose at the Exchange and particularly its snobbish Director Meecham (played by Gielgud).Financing the deal is the multi-millionaire Clyde Massey (played by Trevor Howard), who wants a large diamond to be named ""The Massey."" However, things do not go according to plan and when Chesser is robbed of the diamond on his return from getting it cut he finds himself blackmailed by Massey into engineering the theft of all four tons of diamonds stockpiled at the Exchange.  With the help of his free-spirited girlfriend Maren (Bergen), the gravely ill employee at the Exchange named Watts (played by Mason) and a giant vacuum hose the three manage to literally suck up all the diamonds through the wiring system. It's an ingenious plot and I liked the line of commentary from Grodin. As he sits on the roof hearing the stones going through the hose he ponders what the hourly rate might be for work like this.Yet, all is not as it seems. And the fact that there is still a half-hour of movie left after the theft is completed should tell you that a bigger and more rousing climax is approaching, and does it ever with gun-toting men on horseback and cars chasing Chesser and Maren through the English countryside.All in all this is a thoroughly entertaining movie and much better than some other titles that have already seen a DVD release. Come on Fox, give us this movie in our favorite format.",5,"Come on Fox, please give us a DVD of this entertaining caper movie",1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2980,"['Update', 'Thankfully', 'DVD', 'been', 'released', 'movie', 'United', 'States', 'finally', 'part', 'DVD', 'collection.I', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'entertaining', '1970s', 'caper', 'movie', 'so', 'even', 'am', 'DVD', 'devotee', 'had', 'qualms', 'picking', 'up', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Though', 'region-free', 'DVD', 'player', 'handy', 'movies', 'THE', 'FOURTH', 'PROTOCOL', 'HIGH', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'CHINA', 'WHEN', 'EIGHT', 'BELLS', 'TOLL', 'SILVER', 'BEARS', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'region', 'where', 'movie', 'released.However', 'do', 'have', 'qualm', 'quirky', 'dry', 'humor', 'laden', 'internal', 'commentary', 'lead', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'missing', 'VHS', 'tape', 'essential', 'part', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'engaging', 'movie', 'not', 'filmed', 'strictly', 'comedy', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'Grodins', 'commentary', 'kept', 'atmosphere', 'light', 'carefree', 'even', 'moments', 'high-tension.This', 'movie', 'also', 'benefits', 'truly', 'amazing', 'high-caliber', 'cast', 'Featured', 'Grodin', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'later', 'find', 'fame', 'Murphy', 'Brown', 'James', 'Mason', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Given', 'cast', 'clever', 'humor', 'plot', 'really', 'astounding', 'movie', 'yet', 'find', 'DVD', 'release.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'small-time', 'diamond', 'trader', 'Howard', 'R.', 'Chesser', 'who', 'suddenly', 'negotiating', 'million-pound', 'deal', 'lot', 'more', '1974', 'today', 'Treated', 'contempt', 'Diamond', 'Exchange', 'located', '11', 'Harrowhouse', 'carefully', 'flow', 'diamonds', 'stockpiles', 'tons', 'order', 'maintain', 'value', 'Chesser', 'chance', 'snub', 'nose', 'Exchange', 'particularly', 'snobbish', 'Director', 'Meecham', 'played', 'Gielgud', '.Financing', 'deal', 'multi-millionaire', 'Clyde', 'Massey', 'played', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'who', 'large', 'diamond', 'be', 'named', 'Massey', 'However', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'according', 'plan', 'when', 'Chesser', 'robbed', 'diamond', 'return', 'getting', 'cut', 'blackmailed', 'Massey', 'engineering', 'theft', 'four', 'tons', 'diamonds', 'stockpiled', 'Exchange', 'help', 'free-spirited', 'girlfriend', 'Maren', 'Bergen', 'gravely', 'ill', 'employee', 'Exchange', 'named', 'Watts', 'played', 'Mason', 'giant', 'vacuum', 'hose', 'three', 'manage', 'literally', 'suck', 'up', 'diamonds', 'wiring', 'system', 'ingenious', 'plot', 'liked', 'line', 'commentary', 'Grodin', 'roof', 'hearing', 'stones', 'going', 'hose', 'what', 'hourly', 'rate', 'might', 'be', 'work', 'this.Yet', 'not', 'fact', 'still', 'half-hour', 'movie', 'left', 'theft', 'completed', 'should', 'tell', 'bigger', 'more', 'rousing', 'climax', 'approaching', 'ever', 'gun-toting', 'men', 'horseback', 'cars', 'chasing', 'Chesser', 'Maren', 'English', 'countryside.All', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'titles', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'DVD', 'release', 'Come', 'Fox', 'give', 'movie', 'favorite', 'format']",11 Harrowhouse VHS
494074,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000006GDQ,David Baldwin,"[2, 3]","""11 Harrowhouse"" is that rare bird-a unique and intelligent caper film.  The heist itself isn't anything great but it's the little fluorishes in the film that make it special.  The film emphasizes character even though it contains it's fair share of action and droll comedy.  Normally I don't like voice-over narration because it usually reiterates the obvious.  Charles Grodin's, however, is the exception to the rule because not only does it serve as a greek chorus to what's happening onscreen but adds flavor to the action.  The ensemble cast is universally excellent.  Candice Bergen at the time wasn't taken that seriously as an actress but more than holds her own with her heavyweight co-stars.  I particularly liked James Mason's understated turn as a disgruntled employee of the diamond exchange that Grodin is planning to rob.  Stones fans should note that his character's name is Charlie Watts.  I stumbled upon this film by happenstance-Amazon was offering it in conjunction with ""Lucky Lady"".

I wanted to be the Charles Grodin character, I wanted the Dino Candace Bergen drove, I loved everything about the film. Because of that for years I've tried to find it on DVD without succss. I read about how the narrative track had been removed and that was a great disappointment because that is a key part of the film. So I was surprised and intrigued to see this DVD on the market. I bought it hoping that it had all of the elements of the original film because I wanted to share this gem with my spouse. I am so glad that I bought it.

And not only did Candice Bergen illustrate the polar opposite personality to that of Marin in the book; but to watch her twist and roil her way through her idea of ""acting"" was both boring and painful at the same time.

I found the movie to be one of the absolute worst adaptations of a book I have ever seen. The book was absolutely spellbinding, but the movie has little in common with the book other than the name and the same basic premise, stealing diamonds. The tone of the book was dark and full of drama and adventure. The tone of the movie was light, nearly comedic. Plus who would ever believe Charles Grodin as a diamond thief or even a diamond dealer. When I first read the book in 1973, I pictured Paul Newman as Chesser. Grodin was a substantial let down. James Mason was the only bit of great casting. Candace Bergan was pretty good, but she would have been better in the role had it been truer to the book. I really can't recommend this film. I can highly recommend the book. Read the book first, then if you must, watch the movie. You will see what I mean. Also, the surprise twist at the end of the book is nowhere to be found in the movie, which ends in a sort of madcap chase scene that reminded me of the final scene in ""The Pink Panther.""

This is the kind of cops and robbers caper that does not involve breaking, entering,using explosives or taking a platoon of hostages to accomplish the objective.  Would you believe it only took just one woman and two men to successfully remove $12 billion in uncut diamonds from what was a virtual fortress?  Surrounded by thick steel impervious to a 75mm cannon shell, the vault where the diamonds were stored and the building that housed the world's largestclearing house for gems were not open to the public. In fact the activities of each of the handful of long time employees were carefully monitored by armed guards who addressed each ofthese men (this place apparently employed no women) by their last names.The heist was craftily and successfully carried out without a single gunshot fired.  Okay, one of the accomplices who remained in the vault until the theft was discovered collapses and dies.The character played by James Mason was only a few months short of gaining full retirement benefits. But the management of 11 Harrowhouse would not grant him that exemption since hewould be dead from an incurable disease much sooner. Hence he could not turn down an offer from the masterminds of the robbery for a small cut of the take. All he had to do was tounscrew the plate that covered the electric socket next to his desk and watch for a pair of cockroaches.The way this movie ends is simply outrageous.
