I think maybe it was too much of what I expected. The ending isn't satisfying.There aren't any major plot twists you haven't already figured out. The revelations come too little too late and never answer most of the questions the series brings up. So much is just left hanging, justified by an ending that renders everything that happens irrelevant. Well maybe not irrelevant, but certainly less important. There's a sense of meaninglessness in it all that I found depressing. And why kill everyone? What was accomplished by that?So Ayato fails to escape his fate and is forced to become Rah. The real Rah or Xephon's Rah? Is there a difference? I was hoping for a more scientific approach to the whole Aztec myth premise and a firm scientific explanation of the Xephon system, but instead what I get is some glorified techno/religious babble that doesn't explain anything. The series should have stopped playing peek-a-boo in DVD6 and started giving FIRM answers to satisfy the viewers, yet they continue in meaningless cloak and dagger play with no real answers. The Xephon system is never explained. Dolem are never explained. The Mu are never explained.I think perhaps I have a fundamental philosophical difference of opinion with the writers of this series. They appear to be from the school that ""art has no meaning except what the viewer puts into it. I don't have to give it a meaning, and others can interpret it how they like."" Sorry, but all good art needs the artist to give/understand it's meaning. I finished this series and I am left confused by too much meaningless symbolism and unanswered questions.While the first 5 DVDs were good, the last 2 are a real disappointment. Many things are left unanswered and too much is left open to interpretation. Since I made the mistake of buying the DVDs I'm still trying to decide whether to sell them or hold onto them for the first few DVDs sake.

This show alone makes me want to expand my vocabulary just so that I can find a way to praise this series to the greatest extent that I am capable of.From the very beginning of Rahxephon, I was intrigued, though I wasn't sure what to make of it at first.  Each episode became like a piece of a puzzle that slowly put together the whole picture of everything that was going on.  And most surprisingly of all, was the touching romance found throughout.  The love between the two main characters is so deep and beautiful that it leaves you with that warm fuzzy feeling you get after drinking hot chocolate on a cold day.This last volume was simply amazing.  I was blown away by the animation, which not only exceeded my expectations, but practically tossed them out the window.  Everything was gorgeous. The backgrounds, the character designs, even the mecha.  Just about everything you wanted to know about is explained perfectly and carefully, without ever feeling rushed or ridiculous, while some of the more discreet elements are left shrouded in mystery to ponder later and during repeated viewings.And best of all, the ending is wondeful and leaves you happy.  I can't tell you how important of a thing that is.  Lately, I've found myself extremely disappointed with anime endings.  Wild Arms and Orphen, which left me confused and annoyed, Noir and Lain, which both left me feeling depressed and annoyed. Berserk... I'm not even going to go into how that anime ended.  Full Metal Panic, definitely disappointed me.  Come to think of it, a lot of animes just leave you thinking ""that's it?  Where the heck is the rest!""  But not Rahxephon.  It left me smiling and feeling very pleased and moved.To those that unfairly compare this to Neon Genesis Evangelion, please try and be fair.  I personally didn't even find myself thinking of the other show at all while I watched it.  Definitely a new favorite of mine.

783537,A7FVX0OOEIHYZ,B0000TPARO,"Bjorn ""wolf-sigma""","[5, 9]","Welcome to RahXephon, an unabashed ""compliment"" to Neon Genesis Evangelion, and shame on anyone who doubts it.For those of you who finished Neon Genesis Evangelion with crossed eyes and drool at the corner of your mouth, have heart; I was there with you.  Even the new End of Evangelion, an amazing and awe inspiring anime, brings little real closure other than what the watcher decides to believe.  Evangelion is a mish mash of confused monologues, esoteric concepts and diluted theology.  And that never stopped everyone from loving it.Why am I reviewing Evangelion when RahXephon is what I am supposed to be writing about?  Well, RahXephon is so much like Evangelion that to not mention them together would be criminal.  Each episode is set up much like Evangelion, with a singular enemy appearing, the command unit deciding on a course of action, and the hero eventually somehow defeating the enemy, often after a crisis of character.  Even the D1's in this series are angelic, more so even than Evangelion's but the relation is uncanny.  Our main Character, Ayato, even acts like Shinji much of the time, endlessly questioning his own motives and his place in the world.  The supporting cast also closely resembles those in Evangelion in one way or another.BUT!  This is not a criticism!  The fact is that Evangelion is one of the most influential anime series of all time and it would be a damn shame if it wasn't borrowed from occasionally.  What is special to RahXephon is, although the last few episodes break into a highly philosophical tone, it is not so confused as Evangelion. And by confused I mean that if you really listen to the last two episodes of Evangelion, and I mean really listen, they are not saying anything sensical.  It is up to the viewer to take from it whatever they want.  RahXephon is less demanding, allowing each viewer some lee way on interpretation but also setting a definite theme.  Still, as I listened real close to RahXephons's ending, again the ideas were simple after the obsessive diolouge was sifted through.The reason I give RahXephon a 4 instead of a 5 is that, as amazing as it is and as well done, there are still a number of series out there that are just plain better.  Cowboy Bebop and Escaflowne come to mind.  I also personally disliked the level to which characters constantly questioned themselves, something that is much more common in anime than Hollywood.  Whether this is cultural or otherwise, I know not.  All I know is that as the end apporaches, its not action filled...its thought provoking.In the end, RahXephon is worthy of any collection, though maybe not worth buying each disk individually.  Because ultimately, unless you haven't seen Evangelion, you'll be noticing a lot of similarity throughout this series.  And while that doesn't diminish this title, it is worth consideration.",4,Playgery is the Highest Form of Compliment,1100217600,"11 12, 2004",2004,2853,"['Welcome', 'RahXephon', 'unabashed', 'compliment', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'shame', 'anyone', 'who', 'it.For', 'who', 'finished', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'crossed', 'eyes', 'drool', 'corner', 'mouth', 'have', 'heart', 'was', 'there', 'Even', 'new', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'amazing', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'anime', 'little', 'real', 'closure', 'other', 'what', 'watcher', 'believe', 'Evangelion', 'mish', 'mash', 'confused', 'monologues', 'esoteric', 'concepts', 'diluted', 'theology', 'never', 'stopped', 'everyone', 'loving', 'it.Why', 'am', 'reviewing', 'Evangelion', 'when', 'RahXephon', 'what', 'am', 'supposed', 'be', 'writing', 'Well', 'RahXephon', 'so', 'much', 'Evangelion', 'not', 'mention', 'together', 'would', 'be', 'criminal', 'episode', 'set', 'up', 'much', 'Evangelion', 'singular', 'enemy', 'appearing', 'command', 'unit', 'deciding', 'course', 'action', 'hero', 'eventually', 'somehow', 'defeating', 'enemy', 'often', 'crisis', 'character', 'Even', 'D1', 'series', 'are', 'angelic', 'more', 'so', 'even', 'Evangelion', 'relation', 'uncanny', 'main', 'Character', 'Ayato', 'even', 'Shinji', 'much', 'time', 'endlessly', 'questioning', 'own', 'motives', 'place', 'world', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'closely', 'Evangelion', 'one', 'way', 'another.BUT', 'not', 'criticism', 'fact', 'Evangelion', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'anime', 'series', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'damn', 'shame', 'was', ""n't"", 'borrowed', 'occasionally', 'What', 'special', 'RahXephon', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'break', 'highly', 'philosophical', 'tone', 'not', 'so', 'confused', 'Evangelion', 'confused', 'mean', 'really', 'listen', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'Evangelion', 'mean', 'really', 'listen', 'are', 'not', 'saying', 'anything', 'sensical', 'viewer', 'take', 'want', 'RahXephon', 'less', 'demanding', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'lee', 'way', 'interpretation', 'also', 'setting', 'definite', 'theme', 'Still', 'listened', 'real', 'close', 'RahXephons', 'ending', 'again', 'ideas', 'were', 'simple', 'obsessive', 'diolouge', 'was', 'sifted', 'reason', 'give', 'RahXephon', '4', 'instead', '5', 'that', 'as', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'still', 'number', 'series', 'there', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'better', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Escaflowne', 'come', 'mind', 'also', 'personally', 'disliked', 'level', 'characters', 'constantly', 'questioned', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'anime', 'Hollywood', 'cultural', 'otherwise', 'know', 'not', 'know', 'end', 'not', 'action', 'filled', 'thought', 'provoking.In', 'end', 'RahXephon', 'worthy', 'collection', 'maybe', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'disk', 'individually', 'ultimately', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Evangelion', ""'ll"", 'be', 'noticing', 'lot', 'similarity', 'series', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'title', 'worth', 'consideration']",N/A

783540,A1H2RT46AOYW43,B0000TPARO,Issei Takechi,"[4, 4]","This series is vastly less well-known than Neon Genesis Evangelion even in Japan partly because it was broadcast after midnight. The release of the theater version last spring did not make much of a splash, either.In my opinion NGE is ultimately a story of a family disguised as sci-fi anime, and RahXephone seems to cover a similar terrain as the story centers around Ayato Kamina's identity crisis and his search for his true self. As in NGE, the primary characters here feel somewhat alienated against each other and struggle hard to get their true feelings across. It is in this respect that the Jupiter barrier is to this series what the AT field is to NGE as they both represent the mental barriers that the characters harbor deep inside themselves. However, befitting their adolescent mentality, Ayato's and Haruka's yearning for each other seems more sugarcoated and thus less urgent than Shinji Ikari's yearning for love and recognition.All the references to ancient mythology and music are ultimately peripheral to the main argument of this series. And I must admit that I could not get all the characters' names right until the very end of the series.

After being forced to action after fleeing from the disasters of the previous episodes Ayato Kamino finds himself at a crossroads in his own quest for identity.  He fears that, if he gives in to the call of the RahXephon, he will lose his own personality.  But the war between the Mu and humanity reaches a fevered pitch around him.  If he does not commit, the ruin of what he loves is inevitable.  Torn between his love for Haruka and the lure of Quon, Ayato most make a great leap of faith, with results that are difficult to absorb.Watching these episodes is like falling through one layer of deception after another.  Like an onion, the viewer first sees the interpersonal deceptions, then the deceptions of Mu and human, and finally the deceptions created by director Yutaka Izubuchi.  These components are so intertwined that it is impossible to determine whether Izubuchi was deadly serious or tongue-in-cheek.  This creates an intentional air of unease which is hardly relieved when the entire plot is once again stood on its head on last, glorious time.  After pointing out that RahXephon was quite a bit different than Evangelion, These final episodes unexpectedly reestablishe RahXephons relationship to its noble predecesspr, while retaining a great deal of independent creativity.From all production viewpoints - art, animation, music, acting, etc. - these final moments are outstanding, frame after frame.  I have to say that I'm happy to have decided to follow the series, even if I haven't quite figured out what to make of it.

783542,ABVULUZ2ILKKO,B0000TPARO,Stephen Ressel,"[5, 32]","Wow!  I finally watched it!  The seventh DVD of RahXephon has sat on my entertainment center for 2 months while I tried to find the ability to overcome the prediction of silliness and boredom that would rush over me watching the final 3 episodes.  Now I can truely say this series is absolutely ridiculous and laughable.  Perhaps the one moment in the series I actually busrt out laughing at the story was when the world was caught in the moment of apotheosis granted by Babhem....and it turned into an EGG!  haha AND THEN YOU HEAR A CRACKING NOISE!  Oh god, precious.Overall, the series gets one star.  The one star is for the five star art and animation, but everything else was truely attrocious (aside from the DVD authoring and packaging by ADV Films who did a great job with voices and over all product detail).  This series would have been incredible if it had good writing and storytelling, but from the basic premise down to storyboarding, the whole Japanese crew was abominable, then everyone following the boards was pretty incredible.  Typical to every other DVD in the RahXephon series, it mirrors Evangelion on some level and creates a kind of post-modern malais of images and sequences ripped from other anime/movies while trying to create its own identity with useless red herrings or obscure imagery.  Everyone was someone's mom/son/sister/father it seemed, and when the characters were done with their usefulness, they died for no real reason then that the writer thought a death would create more meaning then interaction during their part of the play.  None of the dialogue really made any sense, and none of the plot really had any meaning either.  Like the odd dreams and hallucinations that littered the series AND these final episodes, this story was basically a potpourri of random information the writer grabbed from around him while trying to get a chunky paycheck.  Sad.  The night before watching RahXephon 7 I saw CAGLIOSTRO and GIANT ROBO where every line of dialogue and every action meant something, and the storytelling through the film/boarding was precise and rousing.  Comparatively, this series was absolutely the anti-masterpiece, but hopefully anime will resurrect out of skillless stories and filmwork to continue the genius it was paving in the early and mid-ninties with shows like ROBO, GOLDEN BOY, EVANGELION (kind of), TYLER, FLCL (a bit beyond the ninties), COWBOY BEBOP, YUA OVAs, NINJA SCROLL and others that had strong scripting and precise visuals to blue print the animation through to final film.Even in the end, with the last scenes, the writer basically says, 'Hey!  It was all written as if it was a story in the mind of a 16 year old!  Don't hold me responsible! HAHAHAHA!!!'  And following his lead, I'll leave you with touch of RahXephon by pulling an obtuse piece of dialogue from the show and displaying it for all of you to boggle over, and come to the conclusion that this review was great because you didn't understand it...'Hey those stairs are dangerous!'",1,The world infused with sound = a lot of noise.,1077408000,"02 22, 2004",2004,3021,"['finally', 'watched', 'seventh', 'DVD', 'RahXephon', 'sat', 'entertainment', 'center', '2', 'months', 'tried', 'find', 'ability', 'overcome', 'prediction', 'silliness', 'boredom', 'would', 'rush', 'watching', 'final', '3', 'episodes', 'Now', 'can', 'truely', 'say', 'series', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'laughable', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'moment', 'series', 'actually', 'busrt', 'out', 'laughing', 'story', 'was', 'when', 'world', 'was', 'caught', 'moment', 'apotheosis', 'granted', 'Babhem', '.and', 'turned', 'EGG', 'haha', 'THEN', 'YOU', 'HEAR', 'A', 'CRACKING', 'NOISE', 'Oh', 'god', 'precious.Overall', 'series', 'one', 'star', 'one', 'star', 'five', 'star', 'art', 'animation', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'truely', 'attrocious', 'aside', 'DVD', 'authoring', 'packaging', 'ADV', 'Films', 'who', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'voices', 'product', 'detail', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'incredible', 'had', 'good', 'writing', 'storytelling', 'basic', 'premise', 'down', 'storyboarding', 'whole', 'Japanese', 'crew', 'was', 'abominable', 'then', 'everyone', 'following', 'boards', 'was', 'pretty', 'incredible', 'Typical', 'other', 'DVD', 'RahXephon', 'series', 'Evangelion', 'level', 'kind', 'post-modern', 'malais', 'images', 'sequences', 'ripped', 'other', 'anime/movies', 'trying', 'create', 'own', 'identity', 'useless', 'red', 'herrings', 'obscure', 'imagery', 'Everyone', 'was', 'someone', 'mom/son/sister/father', 'seemed', 'when', 'characters', 'were', 'done', 'usefulness', 'died', 'real', 'reason', 'then', 'writer', 'thought', 'death', 'would', 'create', 'more', 'meaning', 'then', 'interaction', 'part', 'play', 'None', 'dialogue', 'really', 'made', 'sense', 'none', 'plot', 'really', 'had', 'meaning', 'either', 'odd', 'dreams', 'hallucinations', 'littered', 'series', 'AND', 'final', 'episodes', 'story', 'was', 'basically', 'potpourri', 'random', 'information', 'writer', 'grabbed', 'trying', 'get', 'chunky', 'paycheck', 'Sad', 'night', 'watching', 'RahXephon', '7', 'saw', 'CAGLIOSTRO', 'GIANT', 'ROBO', 'where', 'line', 'dialogue', 'action', 'meant', 'something', 'storytelling', 'film/boarding', 'was', 'precise', 'rousing', 'Comparatively', 'series', 'was', 'absolutely', 'anti-masterpiece', 'hopefully', 'anime', 'will', 'resurrect', 'skillless', 'stories', 'filmwork', 'continue', 'genius', 'was', 'paving', 'early', 'mid-ninties', 'shows', 'ROBO', 'GOLDEN', 'BOY', 'EVANGELION', 'kind', 'TYLER', 'FLCL', 'bit', 'ninties', 'COWBOY', 'BEBOP', 'YUA', 'OVAs', 'NINJA', 'SCROLL', 'others', 'had', 'strong', 'scripting', 'precise', 'visuals', 'blue', 'print', 'animation', 'final', 'film.Even', 'end', 'last', 'scenes', 'writer', 'basically', 'was', 'all', 'written', 'was', 'story', 'mind', '16', 'year', 'old', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'responsible', 'HAHAHAHA', 'following', 'lead', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'touch', 'RahXephon', 'pulling', 'obtuse', 'piece', 'dialogue', 'show', 'displaying', 'boggle', 'come', 'conclusion', 'review', 'was', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'stairs', 'are', 'dangerous']",N/A
