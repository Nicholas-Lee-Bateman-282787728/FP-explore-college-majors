This is a great discovery for science, and for the rest of the world. He was found by hikers up in the alps, at first they thought it was the body of a climber who had lost his life up there. But on further shoveling they discoverd primitive tools near the Icemans body, and knew they had come across something unbelieveable. It was the body of a stone age man. This documentary shows you performing an autopsy on the body, to try and unravel the mysterys surrounding this frozen man. And you will learn how he died. The Iceman lived all those many centurys ago, even 3,OOO years befor Christ was born, so that is a very long time ago. Some of his community were farmers, others were nomads. But he was just a person. Like us. He looked the same as we do. He ate meat too. They found the contents of a meat and bread meal still in his stomach. The only difference with this man, is he carried bows and arrows around with him. This documentary is well worth watching. As they will never find another, quite like him.",5,KATELAND,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,1136,"['What', 'interesting', 'specimen', 'ICEMAN', 'think', 'was', 'murded', '5', 'OOO', 'years', 'ago', 'yet', 'mummfied', 'body', 'here', 'today', 'great', 'discovery', 'science', 'rest', 'world', 'was', 'found', 'hikers', 'up', 'alps', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'body', 'climber', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'life', 'up', 'there', 'further', 'shoveling', 'discoverd', 'primitive', 'tools', 'Icemans', 'body', 'knew', 'had', 'come', 'something', 'unbelieveable', 'was', 'body', 'stone', 'age', 'man', 'documentary', 'performing', 'autopsy', 'body', 'try', 'unravel', 'mysterys', 'surrounding', 'frozen', 'man', 'will', 'learn', 'how', 'died', 'Iceman', 'lived', 'many', 'centurys', 'ago', 'even', '3', 'OOO', 'years', 'befor', 'Christ', 'was', 'born', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'community', 'were', 'farmers', 'others', 'were', 'nomads', 'was', 'just', 'person', 'looked', 'same', 'do', 'ate', 'meat', 'too', 'found', 'contents', 'meat', 'bread', 'meal', 'still', 'stomach', 'only', 'difference', 'man', 'carried', 'bows', 'around', 'documentary', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'quite']",Nova: Iceman Murder Mystery

The oldest human body ever found.  He's a messenger from the past, bearing secrets of how humans lived nearly a 1000 years before the [Great] Pyramids [of Egypt].  He is also a homicide, waiting to be solved.Who was he?  And who shot an arrow into his back?  Was it warfare?  Or murder?Now a rare and dangerous procedure [autopsy] leads to some startlingly fresh clues.  A piece of bone, a copper axe, and a last meal surprise the experts, as they come closer to understanding our ancient past and to solving the Iceman murder mystery.""The above is said by the narrator at the beginning of this extraordinary documentary.The mummy was found and pulled from a glacier Sept. 1991 in the Otztal Alps near the border between Austria and Italy.  Thus, the Iceman is also known as ""Otzi.""An autopsy was performed (including a DNA analysis) giving details of Otzi's death and life.Throughout the program brief comments are made by an alpine archaeologist, radiologist, etc.Near the end of the documentary, all the evidence that's found is considered leading to an unexpected conclusion of who killed Otzi.Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2012) is perfect in picture and audio quality.  There are no extras.In conclusion, this is an exceptional documentary that may have solved the ""world's oldest open case of homicide!!""(2011;  55 min;  wide screen;  6 scenes;  PBS-NOVA/National Geographic)&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",5,Defrosting the ultimate time-capsule: a 5000-year-old man!!,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,1627,"['XXXXX', 'Frozen', 'more', '5000', 'years', 'remote', 'mountain', 'pass', 'now', 'preserved', 'ages', 'refrigerated', 'tomb', 'Iceman', 'frozen', 'relic', 'Stone', 'Age', 'oldest', 'human', 'body', 'ever', 'found', 'messenger', 'past', 'bearing', 'secrets', 'how', 'humans', 'lived', 'nearly', '1000', 'years', '[', 'Great', ']', 'Pyramids', '[', 'Egypt', ']', 'also', 'homicide', 'waiting', 'be', 'solved.Who', 'was', 'who', 'shot', 'arrow', 'back', 'Was', 'warfare', 'murder', 'Now', 'rare', 'dangerous', 'procedure', '[', 'autopsy', ']', 'startlingly', 'fresh', 'clues', 'piece', 'bone', 'copper', 'axe', 'last', 'meal', 'surprise', 'experts', 'come', 'closer', 'understanding', 'ancient', 'past', 'solving', 'Iceman', 'murder', 'mystery', 'above', 'said', 'narrator', 'beginning', 'extraordinary', 'documentary.The', 'mummy', 'was', 'found', 'pulled', 'glacier', 'Sept.', '1991', 'Otztal', 'Alps', 'border', 'Austria', 'Italy', 'Thus', 'Iceman', 'also', 'known', 'Otzi', 'autopsy', 'was', 'performed', 'including', 'DNA', 'analysis', 'giving', 'details', 'Otzi', 'death', 'program', 'brief', 'comments', 'are', 'made', 'alpine', 'archaeologist', 'radiologist', 'etc.Near', 'end', 'documentary', 'evidence', 'found', 'considered', 'leading', 'unexpected', 'conclusion', 'who', 'killed', 'Otzi.Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', '2012', 'perfect', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'extras.In', 'conclusion', 'exceptional', 'documentary', 'may', 'have', 'solved', 'world', 'oldest', 'open', 'case', 'homicide', '2011', '55', 'min', 'wide', 'screen', '6', 'scenes', 'PBS-NOVA/National', 'Geographic', 'lt', 'lt', 'Stephen', 'Pletko', 'London', 'Ontario', 'Canada', '>', '>', 'XXXXX']",Nova: Iceman Murder Mystery
