1149885,A2V96BLJYN5CR9,B0015LPRSI,"A. Crane ""Joy to read""","[6, 8]","I gave this production 2 stars because the overall production quality and acting was fair enough. On the other hand... I had doubts about this remake from the beginning- it's always dangerous to remake something done so well once. Some (on this site) found the 1985 version stuffy and too romantic, but that's the whole point. The juxtoposition of fantastically sensual scenery against turn of the century English stuffiness was explosive and revealed Lucy's conflict as well as her passionate piano playing. This version suffers from a lack of chemistry between its stars. I'm really not sure if I would have realized there was any attraction between them at all without previous knowledge of the story. So, the supporting cast could not provide the magic of the Merchant/Ivory version and the leads had no chemistry, but it was better than I feared it would be all around---UNTIL the end. The end was awful- it completely gutted the author's intent. SPOILERS!!!Forster did not even leave George's fate up to question- he put him back in Florence after WWI and states specifically that he was a conscientious objector- fully in line with his RWAV characterization. Lucy's tracking down of the gig driver was just tacky and suggests that George was not the catalyst of her sexual awakening, but a place holder. Awful. These were carefully built characters who were gutted in the last minutes of this adaption.Lastly, the only real excuse to remake this film would be to do it as Forster privately imagined it- as a tale of two men- it would be neither difficult nor terribly shocking today. That would be interesting. This was not and appalled at the end.",2,no chemistry and character implosion,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,1655,"['gave', 'production', '2', 'stars', 'overall', 'production', 'quality', 'acting', 'was', 'fair', 'enough', 'other', 'hand', 'had', 'doubts', 'remake', 'beginning-', 'always', 'dangerous', 'remake', 'something', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'once', 'site', 'found', '1985', 'version', 'stuffy', 'too', 'romantic', 'whole', 'point', 'juxtoposition', 'fantastically', 'sensual', 'scenery', 'turn', 'century', 'English', 'stuffiness', 'was', 'explosive', 'revealed', 'Lucy', 'conflict', 'as', 'well', 'passionate', 'piano', 'playing', 'version', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'stars', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'realized', 'was', 'attraction', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'story', 'So', 'supporting', 'cast', 'could', 'not', 'provide', 'magic', 'Merchant/Ivory', 'version', 'leads', 'had', 'chemistry', 'was', 'better', 'feared', 'would', 'be', 'around', '-UNTIL', 'end', 'end', 'was', 'awful-', 'completely', 'gutted', 'author', 'intent', 'SPOILERS', 'Forster', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'leave', 'George', 'fate', 'up', 'question-', 'put', 'back', 'Florence', 'WWI', 'states', 'specifically', 'was', 'conscientious', 'objector-', 'fully', 'line', 'RWAV', 'characterization', 'Lucy', 'tracking', 'gig', 'driver', 'was', 'just', 'tacky', 'George', 'was', 'not', 'catalyst', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'place', 'holder', 'Awful', 'were', 'carefully', 'built', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'gutted', 'last', 'minutes', 'adaption.Lastly', 'only', 'real', 'excuse', 'remake', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'do', 'Forster', 'privately', 'imagined', 'it-', 'tale', 'two', 'men-', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'terribly', 'shocking', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'was', 'not', 'appalled', 'end']",Masterpiece Theatre: Room With a View
1149886,A2RIAXGSBP65BJ,B0015LPRSI,"Amanda Hamm ""writer""","[5, 6]","I have not read the book or watched any other adaptation.  If you have, bear in mind that my review is not based on any comparisons.This was a light movie with enjoyable scenes scattered throughout, but the overall story seemed very thin.  We are introduced to a Miss Honeychurch early on, who is on vacation.  She meets Mr. Emerson and it seems there is a mutual attraction.  They have maybe two conversations before she leaves.  She meets up with Mr. Vyse, a neighbor who it appears she has been acquainted with for some time.  She and Mr. Vyse become engaged and she appears perfectly happy with the choice.  Then Mr. Emerson moves into the neighborhood (we assume by design) and Miss Honeychurch is immediately flustered and forced to choose between the two men.The problem with this is that we haven't been given a chance to care about any of these characters.  A movie with a love triangle needs to make the viewer root for someone.  The other characters try by giving their opinions, but we don't know enough about the other characters to know which opinions to trust.  The movie just lacked good characterization all over the place and then ended somewhat muddled and sudden.  But it was not all bad.  There was occasional witty dialogue and pretty scenery.",3,"Nice scenery, but not enough character development",1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,1265,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'watched', 'other', 'adaptation', 'have', 'bear', 'mind', 'review', 'not', 'based', 'comparisons.This', 'was', 'light', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'scenes', 'scattered', 'overall', 'story', 'seemed', 'very', 'thin', 'are', 'introduced', 'Miss', 'Honeychurch', 'early', 'who', 'vacation', 'Mr.', 'Emerson', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'have', 'maybe', 'two', 'conversations', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Vyse', 'neighbor', 'who', 'been', 'acquainted', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Vyse', 'become', 'engaged', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'choice', 'Then', 'Mr.', 'Emerson', 'neighborhood', 'assume', 'design', 'Miss', 'Honeychurch', 'immediately', 'flustered', 'forced', 'choose', 'two', 'men.The', 'problem', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'care', 'characters', 'movie', 'love', 'triangle', 'make', 'viewer', 'root', 'someone', 'other', 'characters', 'try', 'giving', 'opinions', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'other', 'characters', 'know', 'opinions', 'trust', 'movie', 'just', 'lacked', 'good', 'characterization', 'place', 'then', 'ended', 'somewhat', 'muddled', 'sudden', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'occasional', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'scenery']",Masterpiece Theatre: Room With a View

1149888,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B0015LPRSI,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","2008's A Room With A View&#34; is a Masterpiece Theater dramatization of E.M. Forster's novel of the same name, adapted for the screen by veteran writer Andrew Davies (Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility). The film is produced to the usual quality PBS standards but the adaptation may represent a case of overreaching.The story concerns a young and proper Englishwoman named Lucy, who visits Italy with her spinster chaperone Charlotte in the years prior to the First World War. Upon arrival at a pensione, Lucy and Charlotte find their assigned room lacks a promised view. A Mr. Emerson and his son George obligingly switch accomodations so that Lucy gets her view. In touring nearby Florence, Lucy gets to know Mr. Emerson and George, who are, shockingly, amiable but freethinking socialists and atheists. When Lucy witnesses a street murder, it is George who rescues her. On a subsequent visit to the beautiful Italian countryside, George surprises Lucy by kissing her. Lucy's shocked chaperone rushes her off to Rome to stay with a neighbor from England, a Mr. Vyse. Lucy and Mr. Vyse become engaged and return to England. The engagement falls apart when George appears in Lucy's village, forcing her to confront her lack of real passion for Mr. Vyse.The movie features nicely romantic location shooting in Italy and England. Elaine Cassidy is very acceptable as the young Englishwoman struggling to deal with the conflict between her feelings and her expectations. The supporting cast provides good context for Lucy's dilemma as the touring party in Italy and her family in England. This reviewer wishes they had been given more screen time.Being in love is by definition an irrational state; romantic comedy is mostly for the spectators as we watch people in love go through awkward self-discovery. The process is acceptable as entertainment because, at least in fiction, we expect happy endings. Andrew Davies has been remarkably successful in refreshing Jane Austen's novels for a modern audience, by bringing out points of interest for the modern viewer without damaging the author's original intent. In this case, he may have been less successful. Lucy's sexual awakening is unsubtle. Davies' new ending is, in its first part, a real downer, and in the second, rather implausible. This reviewer was disappointed.&#34;A Room With A View&#34; is worth a look as a different take on a familiar story. Viewers may form their own opinions on whether it is an improvement or not.",3,Fragile love story...,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,2490,"['2008', 'Room', 'A', 'View', '34', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'dramatization', 'E.M.', 'Forster', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'adapted', 'screen', 'veteran', 'writer', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'film', 'produced', 'usual', 'quality', 'PBS', 'standards', 'adaptation', 'may', 'represent', 'case', 'overreaching.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'young', 'proper', 'Englishwoman', 'named', 'Lucy', 'who', 'Italy', 'spinster', 'chaperone', 'Charlotte', 'years', 'prior', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'arrival', 'pensione', 'Lucy', 'Charlotte', 'find', 'assigned', 'room', 'promised', 'view', 'Mr.', 'Emerson', 'son', 'George', 'obligingly', 'switch', 'accomodations', 'so', 'Lucy', 'view', 'touring', 'nearby', 'Florence', 'Lucy', 'know', 'Mr.', 'Emerson', 'George', 'who', 'are', 'shockingly', 'amiable', 'freethinking', 'socialists', 'atheists', 'When', 'Lucy', 'street', 'murder', 'George', 'who', 'subsequent', 'visit', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'countryside', 'George', 'Lucy', 'kissing', 'Lucy', 'shocked', 'chaperone', 'off', 'Rome', 'stay', 'neighbor', 'England', 'Mr.', 'Vyse', 'Lucy', 'Mr.', 'Vyse', 'become', 'engaged', 'return', 'England', 'engagement', 'apart', 'when', 'George', 'Lucy', 'village', 'forcing', 'confront', 'lack', 'real', 'passion', 'Mr.', 'Vyse.The', 'movie', 'features', 'nicely', 'romantic', 'location', 'shooting', 'Italy', 'England', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'very', 'acceptable', 'young', 'Englishwoman', 'struggling', 'deal', 'conflict', 'feelings', 'expectations', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'context', 'Lucy', 'dilemma', 'touring', 'party', 'Italy', 'family', 'England', 'reviewer', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time.Being', 'love', 'definition', 'irrational', 'state', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'mostly', 'spectators', 'watch', 'people', 'love', 'go', 'awkward', 'self-discovery', 'process', 'acceptable', 'entertainment', 'least', 'fiction', 'expect', 'happy', 'endings', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'been', 'remarkably', 'successful', 'refreshing', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novels', 'modern', 'audience', 'bringing', 'out', 'points', 'interest', 'modern', 'viewer', 'damaging', 'author', 'original', 'intent', 'case', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'successful', 'Lucy', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'unsubtle', 'Davies', 'new', 'ending', 'first', 'part', 'real', 'downer', 'second', 'rather', 'implausible', 'reviewer', 'was', 'disappointed.', '34', 'Room', 'A', 'View', '34', 'look', 'different', 'take', 'familiar', 'story', 'Viewers', 'may', 'form', 'own', 'opinions', 'improvement', 'not']",Masterpiece Theatre: Room With a View
1149889,A24BEMERMTXJRY,B0015LPRSI,Ford Ka,"[6, 6]","When one has a Merchant-Ivory production to compare oneself to, one has to be extra careful and quite apparently the authors of the movie failed to remember about this warning. They were apparently aware of the existence of the earlier version and tried to do their best to do something different. And they failed. Partly because they tried at the same time to do something different from the book.The moments of the movie which are good are not very different from the 1986 version. Well, there is not much one can do with Florence but I guess there is something one could do to make the Florentine part not look as if some scenes were exactly reshot with a different cast.There are parts of the new movie which are different - we get a Roman bit (not really included in the novel...) which is nice and colourful (in general, this version is much more subdued than the 1986 one) but it only presents Cecil in a completely wrong light. When he can't kiss Lucy we can't help but wonder (even though the script includes a bit too many allusions to his homosexuality ;) why it is so difficult for him.And then there is the whole structure of the movie. The book (and Merchant/Ivory movie) is set within a time frame of the year. Lucy and Charlotte arrive in Florence in the spring, the English part takes place in the summer, the conflict coincides with the arrival of the autumn, and Lucy is back in Florence in the early spring with George. You don't believe me? Well, don't take my word for it. Read the book!This modest time frame was apparently not enough for producers - they had to add to the novel another time frame and make Lucy revist Italy in 1922, some years after George... was killed in the Great War. Which only proves that getting a decent critical edition can be crucial to success - George could not get killed in the war because he was a consciencious objector and did time for that. He did fight, however, in the Second World War. Anyone who read the book knows this from Forster's postscript written in 1958.The movie ends with Lucy reunited with the Italian coachman. If all her liberation was aimed at this, well, did she really have to wait for some twenty years? It seems the more a waste of time as Lucy of 2007 version is by far more liberated than she was twenty years earlier. This makes the movie more modern but undermines the crucial issue of the plot - spiritual maturation and liberation.In short - a lavish TV production. Not very bad but it doesn't measure up to the 1986 version.",3,Unnecessary - if one word must suffice,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,2514,"['When', 'one', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'production', 'compare', 'be', 'extra', 'careful', 'quite', 'apparently', 'authors', 'movie', 'failed', 'remember', 'warning', 'were', 'apparently', 'aware', 'existence', 'earlier', 'version', 'tried', 'do', 'best', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'failed', 'Partly', 'tried', 'same', 'time', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'book.The', 'moments', 'movie', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'different', '1986', 'version', 'Well', 'not', 'much', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'Florence', 'guess', 'something', 'one', 'could', 'do', 'make', 'Florentine', 'part', 'not', 'look', 'scenes', 'were', 'exactly', 'reshot', 'different', 'cast.There', 'are', 'parts', 'new', 'movie', 'are', 'different', 'get', 'Roman', 'bit', 'not', 'really', 'included', 'novel', 'nice', 'colourful', 'general', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'subdued', '1986', 'one', 'only', 'Cecil', 'completely', 'wrong', 'light', 'When', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kiss', 'Lucy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'even', 'script', 'bit', 'too', 'many', 'allusions', 'homosexuality', 'why', 'so', 'difficult', 'him.And', 'then', 'whole', 'structure', 'movie', 'book', 'Merchant/Ivory', 'movie', 'set', 'time', 'frame', 'year', 'Lucy', 'Charlotte', 'arrive', 'Florence', 'spring', 'English', 'part', 'place', 'summer', 'conflict', 'arrival', 'autumn', 'Lucy', 'back', 'Florence', 'early', 'spring', 'George', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'word', 'Read', 'book', 'modest', 'time', 'frame', 'was', 'apparently', 'not', 'enough', 'producers', 'had', 'add', 'novel', 'time', 'frame', 'make', 'Lucy', 'revist', 'Italy', '1922', 'years', 'George', 'was', 'killed', 'Great', 'War', 'Which', 'only', 'getting', 'decent', 'critical', 'edition', 'can', 'be', 'crucial', 'success', 'George', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'killed', 'war', 'was', 'consciencious', 'objector', 'did', 'time', 'did', 'fight', 'however', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'Forster', 'postscript', 'written', '1958.The', 'movie', 'ends', 'Lucy', 'reunited', 'Italian', 'coachman', 'liberation', 'was', 'aimed', 'well', 'did', 'really', 'have', 'wait', 'twenty', 'years', 'more', 'waste', 'time', 'Lucy', '2007', 'version', 'far', 'more', 'liberated', 'was', 'twenty', 'years', 'earlier', 'movie', 'more', 'modern', 'crucial', 'issue', 'plot', 'spiritual', 'maturation', 'liberation.In', 'short', 'lavish', 'TV', 'production', 'Not', 'very', 'bad', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', '1986', 'version']",Masterpiece Theatre: Room With a View

It makes you feel like you're watching a Reader's Digest version.The new adaptation has a very good cast, particularly Timothy and Rafe Spall as Mr. Emerson and his son. I also liked the casting of Elaine Cassidy as Lucy. Cassidy is not as beautiful as Helen Bonham Carter and I found her more believable. I also preferred Rafe Spall to Julian Sands because Spall is less self-conscious as an actor because he doesn't have to worry about his looks so much. In such a short amount of time I believed he was in love with Lucy.But as another review points out, the storytelling seems rushed and they should have devoted another half hour to characterization. And I really found the new ending unnecessary.I didn't dislike this version though.

I do feel Elaine Cassidy looks a bit more realistic as the tepid, muddled Lucy Honeychurch (Bonham-Carter was a bit too ""polished"" for me), but her portrayal of Lucy lacked the subtlety Bonham-Carter did bring to the screen. In fact, none of the actors were able to convey the gentle hints and ironic turns to the plot as seen in the book and the '85 version. I can place the blame heavily on the writing: Davies stripped the plot of its sweet, nuanced and very Austen-like exploration of the maturation of an Edwardian lady for an aggressiveness--both in dialogue and in the characters. Everything is spelled out instead of shown through the characters's actions, and by changing the ending, tweaking characters, as well as injecting a crudely sexual element, Davies basically took the book and adapted it with his own agenda in mind.

It's very important to keep in mind that this was made for a general public British TV audience - not for American/International art-house cinema audiences or PBS viewers.Yes, it's different than ""the original"", but you need to enjoy it for what its is (someone else's interpretation)rather than consider it only in comparison to what many people feel is the definitive version. If you really love a story, there should be some enjoyment in watching different interpretations of that story for the purpose of comparing and contrasting, and seeing it through different eyes - rather than just in the (re-)telling of the story itself. Of course you're bound to prefer some versions to others, but don't write this off because it's not a duplicate of Merchant/Ivory.I'm really surprised but how upset some reviewers are by this version - it's not that different/off the mark from the book.If you are dead-set on benchmarking this against the Merchant/Ivory classic, don't bother getting it as you'll be wasting your time and money. If you can watch it with an open mind, you'll enjoy it for what is - and there is some excellent casting and acting.One last thought - as a piece of (British) primetime television, this is fantastic compared to the usual TV broadcast rubbish (reality shows, un-funny politcally-correct comedies, soap operas, etc.)",4,A Room with a DIFFERENT View,1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,1582,"['1986', 'Merchant/Ivory', 'adaptation', 'A', 'Room', 'View', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'also', 'book.That', 'said', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'adaptation', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'saw', 'originally', 'aired', 'November', '2007', 'ITV/Channel', '3', 'UK', 'very', 'important', 'keep', 'mind', 'was', 'made', 'general', 'public', 'British', 'TV', 'audience', 'not', 'American/International', 'art-house', 'cinema', 'audiences', 'PBS', 'viewers.Yes', 'different', 'original', 'need', 'enjoy', 'what', 'someone', 'else', 'interpretation', 'rather', 'consider', 'only', 'comparison', 'what', 'many', 'people', 'feel', 'definitive', 'version', 'really', 'love', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'different', 'interpretations', 'story', 'purpose', 'comparing', 'contrasting', 'seeing', 'different', 'eyes', 'rather', 'just', 're-', 'telling', 'story', 'course', ""'re"", 'bound', 'prefer', 'versions', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'off', 'not', 'duplicate', 'Merchant/Ivory.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'upset', 'reviewers', 'are', 'version', 'not', 'mark', 'book.If', 'are', 'dead-set', 'benchmarking', 'Merchant/Ivory', 'classic', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'getting', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wasting', 'time', 'money', 'can', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'what', 'excellent', 'casting', 'acting.One', 'last', 'thought', 'piece', 'British', 'primetime', 'television', 'fantastic', 'compared', 'usual', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'rubbish', 'reality', 'shows', 'un-funny', 'politcally-correct', 'comedies', 'soap', 'operas', 'etc']",Masterpiece Theatre: Room With a View

1149895,A106016KSI0YQ,B0015LPRSI,Jay Dickson,"[13, 13]","After having adapted so many great Victorian novels for the BBC successfully, Andrew Davies tried to set the bar for himself even higher by adapting this E. M. Forster novel which most people would think had been definitively adapted as a film in 1986 by Merchant/Ivory. To give Davies credit, he does work to make this adaptation as different as possible, so he intriguingly plays up the class difference between Lucy Honeychurch and her suitor George Emerson (an element all but ignored in the Merchant-Ivory film) and also elects to have her other suitor, Cecil Vyse, more of a Bloomsbury type than he was in Daniel Day-Lewis's indelible broad caricature of the role from twenty-some years ago. All this seems potentially quite interesting; but Davies--disastrously--chose to make this version much grimmer than the 1986 film. All of the more comic elements of the original novel are drained away so completely that you'd think this were an adaptation of George Moore rather than of one of Forster's funniest novel. The cinematographer's palette here is murky and unlovely, and there's even a grossly unneeded framing device involving George Emerson's death in the trenches of the war and Lucy's return visit to Florence in the 20s that seem pompous and unwieldy. All the actors, even the excellent Sophie Thompson, seem suitably depressed and unhappy; this is really an experiment that failed.",2,The Pension Bertolini Revisited,1234137600,"02 9, 2009",2009,1397,"['having', 'adapted', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'Victorian', 'novels', 'BBC', 'successfully', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'tried', 'set', 'bar', 'even', 'higher', 'adapting', 'E.', 'M.', 'Forster', 'novel', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'think', 'had', 'been', 'definitively', 'adapted', 'film', '1986', 'Merchant/Ivory', 'give', 'Davies', 'credit', 'work', 'make', 'adaptation', 'as', 'different', 'possible', 'intriguingly', 'up', 'class', 'difference', 'Lucy', 'Honeychurch', 'suitor', 'George', 'Emerson', 'element', 'ignored', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'other', 'suitor', 'Cecil', 'Vyse', 'more', 'Bloomsbury', 'type', 'was', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'indelible', 'broad', 'caricature', 'role', 'twenty-some', 'years', 'ago', 'potentially', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Davies', 'disastrously', 'chose', 'make', 'version', 'much', 'grimmer', '1986', 'film', 'more', 'comic', 'elements', 'original', 'novel', 'are', 'drained', 'away', 'so', 'completely', ""'d"", 'think', 'were', 'adaptation', 'George', 'Moore', 'rather', 'one', 'Forster', 'funniest', 'novel', 'cinematographer', 'palette', 'here', 'murky', 'unlovely', 'even', 'grossly', 'unneeded', 'framing', 'device', 'involving', 'George', 'Emerson', 'death', 'trenches', 'war', 'Lucy', 'return', 'visit', 'Florence', '20s', 'seem', 'pompous', 'unwieldy', 'actors', 'even', 'excellent', 'Sophie', 'Thompson', 'seem', 'suitably', 'depressed', 'unhappy', 'really', 'experiment', 'failed']",Masterpiece Theatre: Room With a View

Although I thought the cast of the Merchant Ivory production was magnificent, I actually like a great deal of the cast in this adaptation as well, so I was prepared to view this with an open mind and not hate it instantly because it wasn't Merchant Ivory.  I have seen several of this cast (Cassidy, Cusak, Thompson, Spall) in other productions and thought they were wonderful.  The aspects of this production I found most disappointing were the script and direction.  I found the dialogue to be lackluster, and the interpretation of some of the characters (primarily Cecil) just plain dull.  I have admired some of Davies' adaptations in the past, but his more recent works seem to have an underlying conceit in them that I find distasteful, as though he would deign to ""improve"" the works of the authors he is adapting.  Davies is, indeed a gifted and talented man, but is he really so lofty that he feels capable of enhancing Austen, Forster, and Waugh?  He had a wonderful cast of people to work with for this adaptation, but their performances were never going to reach the stellar level they were capable of when the script they were given to work with was second rate.  I know there was a time limitation, but the story was just diluted and unnecessary additions were made (the additional meeting with the gig driver, George's death, etc)that seemed to serve no purpose other than to needlessly outrage the audience.  I don't understand why Davies feels the need to shock a response out of his audience, rather than impress them with quality.  That cheapens the whole production.

1149898,A21OJ208JYJO7A,B0015LPRSI,Melily,"[1, 1]","On its own, this is an ok film. Funny, unpredictable, a bit odd, with a rather forced ending. However, after watching the older movie adaptation of E. M. Forster's novel, I appreciate this adaptation more. Not that the other is worse; they both have weaknesses, in different areas. First off, I thought the casting and acting in this version were overall much better, especially the lead - Sophie Thompson did a really great job. Maybe it's me, but Helena Bonham-Carter's acting in the other version felt wooden and was generally unconvincing. The exception is George - I thought George was cast much better in the 1980s adaptation. He has much more character, and seems more like an actual person than a caricature (which is how George Emerson-this-version came across - he's just a little too random).The other downside of this version: the way the story was told didn't do much for me. The chemistry between George and Lucy is pretty much non-existant, and the tacked-on ending feels clumsy and strained. Where did the scriptwriters get that ending, anyway??Put briefly, my ideal adaptation would have the cast from this version (except for George) and the storyline/most of the script from the other.",3,"Really good cast, but disappointing in other ways",1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,1204,"['own', 'ok', 'film', 'Funny', 'unpredictable', 'bit', 'odd', 'rather', 'forced', 'ending', 'However', 'watching', 'older', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'E.', 'M.', 'Forster', 'novel', 'appreciate', 'adaptation', 'more', 'Not', 'other', 'worse', 'have', 'weaknesses', 'different', 'areas', 'First', 'thought', 'casting', 'acting', 'version', 'were', 'overall', 'much', 'better', 'especially', 'lead', 'Sophie', 'Thompson', 'did', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'acting', 'other', 'version', 'felt', 'wooden', 'was', 'generally', 'unconvincing', 'exception', 'George', 'thought', 'George', 'was', 'cast', 'much', 'better', '1980s', 'adaptation', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'more', 'actual', 'person', 'caricature', 'how', 'George', 'Emerson-this-version', 'came', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'random', 'other', 'downside', 'version', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'chemistry', 'George', 'Lucy', 'pretty', 'much', 'non-existant', 'tacked-on', 'ending', 'feels', 'clumsy', 'strained', 'Where', 'did', 'scriptwriters', 'get', 'ending', 'anyway', 'Put', 'briefly', 'ideal', 'adaptation', 'would', 'have', 'cast', 'version', 'George', 'storyline/most', 'script', 'other']",Masterpiece Theatre: Room With a View
