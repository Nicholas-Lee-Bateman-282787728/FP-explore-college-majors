Not because it tells an accurate account, but because it is so inaccurate. We have studied Esther before, so I am not worried that this will be a bad influence on the group. They are smarter than that. We will specifically look for the wrong information in the movie. Only Haman comes close to being accurate. I would challenge anyone who thinks this is a great movie to study the bible. Esther was not a weak woman with stars in her eyes. She was intelligent and beautiful.

1634308,A31PS1VR7O27TD,B00BF657AG,John Thornton,"[3, 4]","Not accurate to the Bible at all.  The film ""The Book of Esther"" is NOT an accurate portrayal of the Bible's Book of Esther.  No where in the Bible's Esther is the word God said.  Yet throughout this film God is used.  No where in the Bible's Esther is there a direct voice from God speaking to Esther, yet that happens in this film.  In the Bible's Esther, there is no mention of this first Queen, Vasthi being a spoiled brat, yet that is how she is portrayed in this film.  This film shows Mordicai in a totally different way than the Bible describes.This film DISTORTS the Bible's story of Esther, and in the end offers a false view of the Bible's Esther.  As a Christian that troubled me greatly.  The Bible's Esther is a wonderful story and would make a great film, it did NOT need to be distorted, altered, and revised into what this film displays.On positive notes, the acting by Jen Lilley (Esther) and Joel Smallbone (the King) is very good.  The sets are adequate.  The filming itself, in technique is adequate.  But the other actors are just not very good at all.If the film makers wanted to make some period piece maybe they should have just presented a fictional account, because the way the writers mangled and revised and redacted the Bible's Esther is really disappointing.  Yes, they did admit to revising the story at the beginning, but they did not say they were corrupting the Bible's wonderful account.I will be very hesitant to watch another film by Pure Flix, unless I am looking for a fictional account.",1,Not at all like the Bible's Esther.
