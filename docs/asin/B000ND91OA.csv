My only complaint is that the video on disc 2 is kind of funky.  It's feels like you're watching it in slow motion, or like every other frame was removed.  This problem occurs on about half of the episodes on this disc.  I think that the company is obligated to fix this problem and that everyone who has bought a copy is entitled to a replacement of disc 2.  I think that all fans should try calling technical support and mentioning this error and maybe even write the company about it.I personally don't have any real problem with the packaging of the season.  I always prefer saving shelf space.  I also can't complain at all about the price that I got this season for.

My favorite part is Tim's jabs at Al's unseen supposedly overweight mother.  Hehehe snort snort  Anyway, I like the clear plastic packaging used for this season; looks cool.  I would've preferred the 2-disc per slim case arrangement, though (1 in 1 case, 2 in the other 1).  Would be nice if the episode list could be read on the back outside, not inside right side as I'd have to take out one or both discs if I need to see.  Video quality looks somewhat choppy in the opening sequence, but it's no big deal to me.  I know H.I. has been done on videotape, but it looks more like film to me in some episodes.  Season 6 was the first I ever bought for this series; found it at Target for only $17.99.  I might round out the entire series someday, but not in a hurry to do so.

Instead of the cardboard folding box; holding the three disks with the matching slipcover. It's now a regular clear plastic DVD case. The first disk fits onto the inside front cover and the second and third disk fit onto the back cover respectively. Since the case plastic is clear; the notes and episode names are printed on the back of the label and can be seen once you remove all the disks. There is a cardboard sleeve that slides over the top of the case; that most people will probably throw away. To give you a better idea what this looks like. It looks just like the ""Pirates of the Caribbean; Dead Man's Chest"" set that Disney released a few month ago. (The same type of set up). I'm not complaining that much however; because the price for this and probably for the remaining seasons will be very low now.
