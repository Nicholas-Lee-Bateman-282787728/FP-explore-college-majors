382959,A2OEUROGZDTXUJ,630363642X,Amazon Customer,"[3, 5]","This movie was made 20 years ago, yet it is probably more relevant now than it was when it was released.  I'm sure that if it were remade today, it would make headlines everywhere and be banned in several areas.  This mockumentary is striking in its honesty.In 2042, abortion is illegal.  ""Barrier devices,"" such as condoms, are legal.  ""Irritants,"" such as IUDs are illegal, but still available on the black market. Since they are not administered by a medical professional (or even sterilized), women often become septic.  If they are caught with such a device, they may be sentenced to three years in prison.This story shows the glaring differences between different socioeconomic classes as well as racial divide in laws, or rather, how laws are prosecuted.The scariest thing about this movie is that it chronicles exactly how easy our rights can be sucked away from us.  We have become complacent. We, as a society, need to do more to protect our rights.  Even to those of you that welcome government into your wombs by allowing restrictions on reproductive freedoms, this movie shows how restrictions can spread.  ""Search and seizure laws"" get slashed, allowing entire neighborhoods to be searched in order to control ""hypercrime.""""People will invest more energy into protecting their jewelry than protecting their liberty.  Women not only placed their anatomical liberty on their doorstep, they elected the people who snatched it way.""Rain Without Thunder should be shared with everyone concerned about maintaining and expanding personal freedoms.",5,Frightening...,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,1554,"['movie', 'was', 'made', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'probably', 'more', 'relevant', 'now', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'released', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'remade', 'today', 'would', 'make', 'headlines', 'everywhere', 'be', 'banned', 'several', 'areas', 'mockumentary', 'striking', 'honesty.In', '2042', 'abortion', 'illegal', 'Barrier', 'devices', 'such', 'condoms', 'are', 'legal', 'Irritants', 'such', 'IUDs', 'are', 'illegal', 'still', 'available', 'black', 'market', 'are', 'not', 'administered', 'medical', 'professional', 'even', 'sterilized', 'women', 'often', 'become', 'septic', 'are', 'caught', 'device', 'may', 'be', 'sentenced', 'three', 'years', 'prison.This', 'story', 'glaring', 'differences', 'different', 'socioeconomic', 'classes', 'as', 'well', 'racial', 'divide', 'laws', 'rather', 'how', 'laws', 'are', 'prosecuted.The', 'scariest', 'thing', 'movie', 'exactly', 'how', 'easy', 'rights', 'can', 'be', 'sucked', 'away', 'have', 'become', 'complacent', 'society', 'need', 'do', 'more', 'protect', 'rights', 'Even', 'welcome', 'government', 'wombs', 'allowing', 'restrictions', 'reproductive', 'freedoms', 'movie', 'how', 'restrictions', 'can', 'spread', 'Search', 'seizure', 'laws', 'get', 'slashed', 'allowing', 'entire', 'neighborhoods', 'be', 'searched', 'order', 'control', 'hypercrime', 'People', 'will', 'invest', 'more', 'energy', 'protecting', 'jewelry', 'protecting', 'liberty', 'Women', 'not', 'only', 'placed', 'anatomical', 'liberty', 'doorstep', 'elected', 'people', 'who', 'snatched', 'way', 'Rain', 'Thunder', 'should', 'be', 'shared', 'everyone', 'concerned', 'maintaining', 'expanding', 'personal', 'freedoms']",Rain Without Thunder VHS
382960,A1LV6LMUHV3DNS,630363642X,"C. Bauer ""buccaneer""","[1, 3]","I saw this movie on a local channel, with commercial breaks, with great interest.  I'd never heard of it.  I have since ordered a copy of it with great difficulty.  Why is that I wonder?Could it be because this is a film of America after the repeal of Roe v. Wade?  A time set some 60 years from now.  A film that illustrates just exactly where the anti choice activists and politicians are taking us even if they do not realize it themselves.Imagine a world where the abortionist, the illegal abortionist, is not the only felon but the pregnant woman who seeks to terminate her pregnancy is also.Only one politician, in Mississippi which has the dubious distinction of recently ending all abortions no matter what the circumstances, has faced the ugly truth of America without abortion choices.  He stated that if women resorted to coat hangers so be it.  He really, REALLY, said that in public before cameras for the record.  If women resort to coathangers so be it.But in this film even the women resorting to coathangers, not only those who went to an abortionist, are subjected to an invasive investigation sanctioned by the U.S. Government.  An investigation that includes forced gynecological exams to determine prior pregnancy and ""illegal termination"".  All in the efforts to prosecute these women and send them to jail.To Federal Penitentiares that are especially set up for such women.I'm not surprised this film is easier to see and find in the EU than here.  Something else about ""Rain Without Thunder"" I discovered; difficulty in finding a copy.  Here we are ruled by extremists of every variety who decide what is right for all of us; whose minority opinions rule us.  They reach out even to venues that sell films and books and make their opinions like the force of law.  What other explanation can there be for the rarity of this simple film that screams at us about a world without choice?I fear Roe v. Wade will end.  Too many people who believe in choice are complacent about fighting for it.  And very sensibly they are cautious to fearful in engaging the anti-choice groups who indulge in insane violence and even more insane ideology to promote their views.  Who wants to challenge a crazy person or crazy group of people.But this film illustrates brilliantly this country AFTER the end of Roe v. Wade.  What we will be like then.  Chris Matthews pointedly demanded from a Catholic bishop what would happen to women who sought abortions if he and others succeeded in getting Roe overturned.  Because as I know and Matthews knows, the only choice governments have when recriminalizing abortion is to ALSO punish the pregnant woman.  But of course the bishop could not, or would not, engage in that discussion.  Noone wants to talk about this country AFTER Roe is repealed.  Because we all know what will happen.""Rain Without Thunder"" shows us exactly what our world will be like for all of us.  Watch this film and be politicized to stand up and support a woman's right to choose.",5,THE FUTURE OF REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,3002,"['saw', 'movie', 'local', 'channel', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'great', 'interest', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'have', 'ordered', 'copy', 'great', 'difficulty', 'Why', 'wonder', 'Could', 'be', 'film', 'America', 'repeal', 'Roe', 'v.', 'Wade', 'time', 'set', '60', 'years', 'now', 'film', 'just', 'exactly', 'where', 'anti', 'choice', 'activists', 'politicians', 'are', 'taking', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'realize', 'themselves.Imagine', 'world', 'where', 'abortionist', 'illegal', 'abortionist', 'not', 'only', 'felon', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'who', 'terminate', 'pregnancy', 'also.Only', 'one', 'politician', 'Mississippi', 'dubious', 'distinction', 'recently', 'ending', 'abortions', 'matter', 'what', 'circumstances', 'faced', 'ugly', 'truth', 'America', 'abortion', 'choices', 'stated', 'women', 'resorted', 'coat', 'hangers', 'so', 'be', 'really', 'REALLY', 'said', 'public', 'cameras', 'record', 'women', 'resort', 'coathangers', 'so', 'be', 'it.But', 'film', 'even', 'women', 'resorting', 'coathangers', 'not', 'only', 'who', 'went', 'abortionist', 'are', 'subjected', 'invasive', 'investigation', 'sanctioned', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'investigation', 'forced', 'gynecological', 'exams', 'determine', 'prior', 'pregnancy', 'illegal', 'termination', 'efforts', 'prosecute', 'women', 'send', 'jail.To', 'Federal', 'Penitentiares', 'are', 'especially', 'set', 'up', 'such', 'women.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'film', 'easier', 'see', 'find', 'EU', 'here', 'Something', 'else', 'Rain', 'Thunder', 'discovered', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'copy', 'Here', 'are', 'ruled', 'extremists', 'variety', 'who', 'decide', 'what', 'right', 'minority', 'opinions', 'rule', 'reach', 'out', 'even', 'venues', 'sell', 'films', 'books', 'make', 'opinions', 'force', 'law', 'What', 'other', 'explanation', 'can', 'there', 'be', 'rarity', 'simple', 'film', 'world', 'choice', 'fear', 'Roe', 'v.', 'Wade', 'will', 'end', 'Too', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'choice', 'are', 'complacent', 'fighting', 'very', 'sensibly', 'are', 'cautious', 'fearful', 'engaging', 'anti-choice', 'groups', 'who', 'indulge', 'insane', 'violence', 'even', 'more', 'insane', 'ideology', 'promote', 'views', 'Who', 'challenge', 'crazy', 'person', 'crazy', 'group', 'people.But', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'country', 'end', 'Roe', 'v.', 'Wade', 'What', 'will', 'be', 'then', 'Chris', 'Matthews', 'pointedly', 'demanded', 'Catholic', 'bishop', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'women', 'who', 'sought', 'abortions', 'others', 'succeeded', 'getting', 'Roe', 'overturned', 'know', 'Matthews', 'knows', 'only', 'choice', 'governments', 'have', 'when', 'recriminalizing', 'abortion', 'ALSO', 'punish', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'course', 'bishop', 'could', 'not', 'would', 'not', 'engage', 'discussion', 'Noone', 'talk', 'country', 'AFTER', 'Roe', 'repealed', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Rain', 'Thunder', 'exactly', 'what', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'Watch', 'film', 'be', 'politicized', 'stand', 'up', 'support', 'woman', 'right', 'choose']",Rain Without Thunder VHS

382965,A1Z26JLRD3B48Y,630363642X,"SMC ""SMC""","[12, 18]","I saw this movie for the first time this week. This is a movie that is filmed entirely as a series of interviews by a television reporter, following the imprisonment of a wealthy and White mother and her teenage daughter. The unmarried teenaged daughter had recently become pregnant in the year 2042, and she and her boyfriend had decided marriage and parenthood were not options they could pursue. Unfortunately, current laws made it criminal for women to seek abortions (or ""P-Terms"", as it would be called then). Women who could not afford to leave the country for abortions were often caught and imprisoned (usually non-White, poor mothers), while wealthier women were getting abortions overseas. The government debate on how to catch the wealthier women was chilling - the debate included questions of pregnancy-testing all women at the airports, and ultimately concluded with a legislative decision to create the ""Unborn Child Kidnapping Act."" Thus, pregnant women leaving the country were charged with the crime of kidnapping for the intent to murder an unborn child.Interviews with various individuals examining the imprisonment of the 2 women addressed issues of racial and economic inequality, ""federally-mandated motherhood,"" the history and evolution of the abortion debate (pointing out that the year 2000 saw an overwhelming change towards the conservative right - remember this was filmed in 1992), and the complacency of women towards the abortion debate. It was this complacency which was partially blamed for the radical changes in Roe v Wade, which in fact occured by courts ""whittling it away"" with small and seemingly insignificant changes.The interview style and the futuristic jargon used in the movie can be tedious and distracting. There is little to no ""action"" in this movie - it is strictly a series of interviews looking at the multifaceted picture of how abortion rights could change over the next 50 years (the film was made in 1992, and the movie takes place in 2042). The predictions are chilling, as several of them have come true, 13 years after the film was released. I thought the interviews with the ""Atwood Society Director"" were the most predictive of future trends. I count myself as one of those people who moved from activism to complacency over the past 13 years, and saw that comfortable denial being exposed by this film. It is an angry and scary film, and many viewers could get turned off by the pounding message of the movie - which I think is unfortunate. It has a message which, like ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" should rouse us from our complacency and call us to action.",4,13 years later ...,1164931200,"12 1, 2006",2006,2619,"['saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'week', 'movie', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'series', 'interviews', 'television', 'reporter', 'following', 'imprisonment', 'wealthy', 'White', 'mother', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'unmarried', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'had', 'recently', 'become', 'pregnant', 'year', '2042', 'boyfriend', 'had', 'decided', 'marriage', 'parenthood', 'were', 'not', 'options', 'could', 'pursue', 'Unfortunately', 'current', 'laws', 'made', 'criminal', 'women', 'seek', 'abortions', 'P-Terms', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'then', 'Women', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'afford', 'leave', 'country', 'abortions', 'were', 'often', 'caught', 'imprisoned', 'usually', 'non-White', 'poor', 'mothers', 'wealthier', 'women', 'were', 'getting', 'abortions', 'overseas', 'government', 'debate', 'how', 'catch', 'wealthier', 'women', 'was', 'chilling', 'debate', 'included', 'questions', 'pregnancy-testing', 'women', 'airports', 'ultimately', 'concluded', 'legislative', 'decision', 'create', 'Unborn', 'Child', 'Kidnapping', 'Act', 'Thus', 'pregnant', 'women', 'leaving', 'country', 'were', 'charged', 'crime', 'kidnapping', 'intent', 'murder', 'unborn', 'child.Interviews', 'various', 'individuals', 'examining', 'imprisonment', '2', 'women', 'addressed', 'issues', 'racial', 'economic', 'inequality', 'federally-mandated', 'motherhood', 'history', 'evolution', 'abortion', 'debate', 'pointing', 'out', 'year', '2000', 'saw', 'overwhelming', 'change', 'conservative', 'right', 'remember', 'was', 'filmed', '1992', 'complacency', 'women', 'abortion', 'debate', 'was', 'complacency', 'was', 'partially', 'blamed', 'radical', 'changes', 'Roe', 'v', 'Wade', 'fact', 'occured', 'courts', 'whittling', 'away', 'small', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'changes.The', 'interview', 'style', 'futuristic', 'jargon', 'used', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'tedious', 'distracting', 'little', 'action', 'movie', 'strictly', 'series', 'interviews', 'looking', 'multifaceted', 'picture', 'how', 'abortion', 'rights', 'could', 'change', 'next', '50', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1992', 'movie', 'place', '2042', 'predictions', 'are', 'chilling', 'several', 'have', 'come', 'true', '13', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'thought', 'interviews', 'Atwood', 'Society', 'Director', 'were', 'most', 'predictive', 'future', 'trends', 'count', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'moved', 'activism', 'complacency', 'past', '13', 'years', 'saw', 'comfortable', 'denial', 'being', 'exposed', 'film', 'angry', 'scary', 'film', 'many', 'viewers', 'could', 'get', 'turned', 'off', 'pounding', 'message', 'movie', 'think', 'unfortunate', 'message', 'Inconvenient', 'Truth', 'should', 'rouse', 'complacency', 'call', 'action']",Rain Without Thunder VHS
