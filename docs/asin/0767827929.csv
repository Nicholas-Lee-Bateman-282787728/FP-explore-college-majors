19350,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,0767827929,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[81, 83]","This colorful hippie romp through the Gospel According to Matthew is a classic for kids of all ages, with its attractive, talented cast, and Richard Heimann's wonderful cinematography, with great vistas of New York City as the backdrop; many have the eerie beauty of the World Trade Center as its focus, with one scene taking place on the roof of one of the towers, with the city spread out beneath it.The music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz are delightful, though my favorite song, ""By My Side"", was written by Peggy Gordon and Jay Hamburger.The comedy is broad, and of the many parables told, the story of the Prodigal Son is hilarious, using clips from silent films to illustrate it.The energetic,  gifted ensemble have a wide range of talents, and though this film did not propel any of them to stardom, some have had good careers (mostly with TV work) since this film was released in 1973, especially Victor Garber, who is so marvelous as Jesus, with his lovely, sweet tenor voice and angular movements, Lynne Thigpen, the effervescent bundle of joy who sings ""O Bless the Lord My Soul"", and the very funny Jerry Sroka.As a group, they are all equally strong in their vocal, dance, and comedic skills, and are a large part of why this film works so well.The Last Supper scene is a great piece of staging, and I especially like the added touch of blessing the bread and wine in Hebrew, and the subtle, though gripping handling of the darker portions towards the end keeps this an excellent family film, as even very young children will enjoy the slapstick humor and clever costumes.This film is one of the best stage to screen adaptations, and is a jubilant celebration of life and God's love.",5,still fresh and fun after 30 years,1068681600,"11 13, 2003",2003,1698,"['colorful', 'hippie', 'romp', 'Gospel', 'According', 'Matthew', 'classic', 'kids', 'ages', 'attractive', 'talented', 'cast', 'Richard', 'Heimann', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'great', 'vistas', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'backdrop', 'many', 'have', 'eerie', 'beauty', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'focus', 'one', 'scene', 'taking', 'place', 'roof', 'one', 'towers', 'city', 'spread', 'it.The', 'music', 'lyrics', 'Stephen', 'Schwartz', 'are', 'delightful', 'favorite', 'song', 'My', 'Side', 'was', 'written', 'Peggy', 'Gordon', 'Jay', 'Hamburger.The', 'comedy', 'broad', 'many', 'parables', 'told', 'story', 'Prodigal', 'Son', 'hilarious', 'using', 'clips', 'silent', 'films', 'illustrate', 'it.The', 'energetic', 'gifted', 'ensemble', 'have', 'wide', 'range', 'talents', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'propel', 'stardom', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'careers', 'mostly', 'TV', 'work', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1973', 'especially', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'who', 'so', 'marvelous', 'Jesus', 'lovely', 'sweet', 'tenor', 'voice', 'angular', 'movements', 'Lynne', 'Thigpen', 'effervescent', 'bundle', 'joy', 'who', 'O', 'Bless', 'Lord', 'My', 'Soul', 'very', 'funny', 'Jerry', 'Sroka.As', 'group', 'are', 'equally', 'strong', 'vocal', 'dance', 'comedic', 'skills', 'are', 'large', 'part', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'well.The', 'Last', 'Supper', 'scene', 'great', 'piece', 'staging', 'especially', 'added', 'touch', 'blessing', 'bread', 'wine', 'Hebrew', 'subtle', 'gripping', 'handling', 'darker', 'portions', 'end', 'excellent', 'family', 'film', 'even', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'clever', 'costumes.This', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'stage', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'jubilant', 'celebration', 'life', 'God', 'love']",N/A

This movie just brings back so many memories of my childhood, since I grewup on musicals like Jesus Christ Superstar, Joseph and The Amazing Technolcolor Dream coat. But Godspell is the one that I cherish. I grew up on the 1971 soundtrack, and know the movie. Which I know by heart. Victor Garber is fantasic as Jesus, as is David Haskell, and Lyne Thigpen, Robin Lamont, who sang the famous song, DAY BY DAY. This movie have left out other songs like, We Beesech Thee, and Learn Your Lessons well, but they make up for it, with Beautiful City, which has become a favorite of mine. Also, All Good Gifts, sung by Merral Jackson is so moving and wonderful. What is also striking, is the use of New York Skylines. Making The Big Apple, the cast's own personalplayground. And in the showstopping ""All For the Best"" they cast dances on one of the Twin Towers. Overall, this movie is amazing and joyful.

How can anyone NOT like ""Day by Day"" (or it's reprise), ""Prepare Ye,"" etc.But the FILM? Wellll.....that's another story.It's cool at first to see the straightlaced cast struggling through unfulfilling jobs giving all that up to don clown makeup and prance and frolic through NYC with an unorthodox but reverent reperesentation of Jesus. But sitting through over an hour of this (up to the Last Supper and the inevitable climax) is a bit much to ask of an audience.This gets really freaky at times. A strange Sid and Marty Kroft-type monster confronts the Jesus character as the Pharisees. The prodigal son story is told to a backdrop of silent movie comedies and a ragtime soundtrack. Folks, make no mistake, this movie is STRANGE! The gospel according to H.R. Pufnstuf!However, I'm personally not opposed to an unorthodox retelling of the Story of Christ since the producers were clearly respectful of the subject. The seventies strangeness and weirdo hippiedom will put a lot of people off.

19357,A351XMJF8DCD8Z,0767827929,"bart ""wwfrockfan""","[5, 17]","Let me first tell you about myself before I talk about this movie.  I am an active member my schoo'l drama club.  I have been part of every play since my freshman year.  Whether if its on stage or being part of the crew, you will always find my name somewhere in playbook.  I am going to be completely honest; I know I am not that good when it comes to acting.  So when it comes to being in my school plays, I always find myself in the ensemble cast.  Basically that means I am part of the back round characters.  But that's not bad, in every play where I have been in the ensemble; I always learn to find the fun in it.  I always manage to enjoy my part in the production, even if it is such a small part.  And once the play is over, I always look back and realize that I had a great time.  This year, my High Schools performed GODSPELL in the spring.  However, this year, being my junior year, I decided it was time for me to do something bigger then ensemble.  For the past 3 years, all I have been doing was ensemble or some minor backstage position.  Because I KNEW that I was once again gonna land in the ensemble, and since it was the last production of the year and I was in the ensemble for the two earlier production, I decided not to be in the cast for GODSPELL.  And after watching this movie, which I thought was horrible; I said, ""I am DEFINETLY not being in the cast"".  So I decided to be crew.  But enough about me let me talk about GODSPELL.Basically anybody who is reading should have a good idea about what the plot line is.  It is basically Jesus in the 1960's in New York.  First there is a small twenty-some group living their daily lives in New York when all of sudden they drop their activities and join John the Baptist in water fountain where they all become baptized.  Once they are baptized they meet Jesus.  From there on they follow him around New York City and he teaches them passages from the Bible through various different songs an comical moments.  All the songs have very catchy tunes.  Personally, my favorite ones were ""We Beseech Thee"", ""Light of the World"", ""Bless the Lord"", ""Save the People"", and ""All for the Best"" (Those songs boost this movie up to 2-stars).  And besides teaching the audience about Bible passages, this musical also shows people the life of Jesus in which he was betrayed by one of his closest friends.  That part is a major section of this play; it takes place in the last  part of it.  From then on, the musical changes from lively cheery happy atmosphere into a tragedy.  By the end of the musical, the audience gets a more positive look on the religion of Christianity.Now let me explain why I did not like this movie.  Personally, it was because the movie was very weird, especially the characters.  I know the actors had to portray the characters in their own way, but I liked the ones that my schoolmates portrayed.  I though that my school did much better job of presenting this musical then the movie did.  They made up characters who very likeable and while the ones in this movie were just annoying and they made up such lame humor.  I remember looking at this movie all-weird during its so-called humorous moments.  And I also remember me laughing at the jokes that were included in the my school's production.  By the times this movie was over, I said ""Thank God"".  But when my High school production ended, I looked back and realize that it was a great show and then TOTALLY REGRETTED that I was not in the cast.  I was probably not going to be in the cast anyway even if I did not see this movie, but it still shows that my High school must have done a seriously good job performing this show if it made me feel that way.  Somebody from school taped the play and I own a copy of that.  I am gonna end this by saying that I would much rather watch a taping of my High School performing this musical then watching this movie.",2,"I love the show, but I HATE this movie",1121904000,"07 21, 2005",2005,3902,"['Let', 'first', 'tell', 'talk', 'movie', 'am', 'active', 'member', 'schoo', 'l', 'drama', 'club', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'play', 'freshman', 'year', 'stage', 'being', 'part', 'crew', 'will', 'always', 'find', 'name', 'somewhere', 'playbook', 'am', 'going', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'know', 'am', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'when', 'acting', 'So', 'when', 'being', 'school', 'plays', 'always', 'find', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Basically', 'am', 'part', 'back', 'round', 'characters', 'not', 'bad', 'play', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'ensemble', 'always', 'learn', 'find', 'fun', 'always', 'manage', 'enjoy', 'part', 'production', 'even', 'such', 'small', 'part', 'once', 'play', 'always', 'look', 'back', 'realize', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'year', 'High', 'Schools', 'performed', 'GODSPELL', 'spring', 'However', 'year', 'being', 'junior', 'year', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'do', 'something', 'bigger', 'then', 'ensemble', 'past', '3', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'was', 'ensemble', 'minor', 'backstage', 'position', 'KNEW', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'gon', 'land', 'ensemble', 'was', 'last', 'production', 'year', 'was', 'ensemble', 'two', 'earlier', 'production', 'decided', 'not', 'be', 'cast', 'GODSPELL', 'watching', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'horrible', 'said', 'am', 'DEFINETLY', 'not', 'being', 'cast', 'decided', 'be', 'crew', 'enough', 'let', 'talk', 'GODSPELL.Basically', 'anybody', 'who', 'reading', 'should', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'plot', 'line', 'basically', 'Jesus', '1960', 'New', 'York', 'First', 'small', 'twenty-some', 'group', 'living', 'daily', 'lives', 'New', 'York', 'when', 'sudden', 'drop', 'activities', 'join', 'John', 'Baptist', 'water', 'fountain', 'where', 'become', 'baptized', 'are', 'baptized', 'meet', 'Jesus', 'follow', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'passages', 'Bible', 'various', 'different', 'songs', 'comical', 'moments', 'songs', 'have', 'very', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'Personally', 'favorite', 'ones', 'were', 'Beseech', 'Thee', 'Light', 'World', 'Lord', 'Save', 'People', 'Best', 'songs', 'boost', 'movie', 'up', '2-stars', 'teaching', 'audience', 'Bible', 'passages', 'musical', 'also', 'people', 'life', 'Jesus', 'was', 'betrayed', 'one', 'closest', 'friends', 'part', 'major', 'section', 'play', 'place', 'last', 'part', 'then', 'musical', 'changes', 'lively', 'cheery', 'happy', 'atmosphere', 'tragedy', 'end', 'musical', 'audience', 'more', 'positive', 'look', 'religion', 'Christianity.Now', 'let', 'explain', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'Personally', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'weird', 'especially', 'characters', 'know', 'actors', 'had', 'portray', 'characters', 'own', 'way', 'liked', 'ones', 'schoolmates', 'portrayed', 'school', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'presenting', 'musical', 'then', 'movie', 'did', 'made', 'up', 'characters', 'who', 'very', 'likeable', 'ones', 'movie', 'were', 'just', 'annoying', 'made', 'up', 'such', 'lame', 'humor', 'remember', 'looking', 'movie', 'all-weird', 'so-called', 'humorous', 'moments', 'also', 'remember', 'laughing', 'jokes', 'were', 'included', 'school', 'production', 'times', 'movie', 'was', 'said', 'Thank', 'God', 'when', 'High', 'school', 'production', 'ended', 'looked', 'back', 'realize', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'then', 'TOTALLY', 'REGRETTED', 'was', 'not', 'cast', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'cast', 'anyway', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'still', 'High', 'school', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'seriously', 'good', 'job', 'performing', 'show', 'made', 'feel', 'way', 'Somebody', 'school', 'taped', 'play', 'own', 'copy', 'am', 'gon', 'end', 'saying', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'watch', 'taping', 'High', 'School', 'performing', 'musical', 'then', 'watching', 'movie']",N/A

The songs are legendary, i.e. the pop hit Day By Day, clearly the shows most popular number.  Haunting melodies on songs such as On The Willows and By My Side give the show real emotion.  Songs like All For The Best and Save The People give the show some reall jazz and pizazz, pepping it up and bringing it life, not just boring you like some Sunday church service.It's a great show, very colorful and energetic.

The plot is confusing, since it's basically just Jesus and his disciples acting out parables from the Bible as the plot meanders along, somewhat faithful to the Gospel of Mattthew.  The cast mugs a lot, using a ton of cartoon-y voices and facial expressions, which can get annoying.My favorite part of Godspell is the music. I love almost every song. &quot;Save The People,&quot; &quot;Bless The Lord,&quot; &quot;By My Side,&quot; &quot;Beautiful City,&quot; &quot;Day By Day,&quot; &quot;Turn Back, O Man&quot; are just some of the classics that appear in this film, sung with an exciting innocence, and staged somewhat inventively, especially the &quot;All For The Best,&quot; number.The cast is great - fans of ABC's &quot;Alias&quot; television series will be shocked to see Victor Garber as an Afro'd Superman shirt singing Jesus. I know I was! The great Lynne Thigpen, sadly passed away, gets a great rollicking number in &quot;Bless The Lord,&quot; and the rest of the cast is entertaining as well in their own ways.So this movie may not be for everybody - if you don't think you can handle a movie based on Bible parables, then don't bother buying this.

Costuming aside, a definite religious musical including dancing & singing.

Critics thought this was a little ""light"", but it came out just a year after Jesus Christ Superstar & in my opinion, stayed much truer to the Gospel.  It is a series of parables set to music.  Don't remember John the Baptist playing a dual role in the stage production, but he does in the movie (but I'm not going to give it away here).

19370,AUMVXQK7OYOXC,0767827929,"Freder ""ducksoupproductions""","[0, 0]","Twenty-five years ago I did not like to admit that stage and screen are different media, driven by utterly incompatible engines -- but time has shown that some wonderful stage productions are just plain unfilmable; and by rights the early '70s New Testament Rock Musical Godspell should have been more unfilmable than most.Yet somehow director David Greene managed to pull the thing off. Released in 1973, Greene's film version of Godspell stripped the Broadway show of its dead weight, refined its design and musical score, and siphoned off the best players from several stage productions (notably Victor Garber from a Canadian production and David Haskell, Robin Lamont, Gilbert McCormick, Joanne Jonas and Jeffrey Mylett from New York). That alone would not have insured success. But Greene's gimmick -- that of setting the show's action in the middle of a deserted, pristine New York City, retained the flavor of the stage production while placing it within an entirely filmable framework. Suddenly Godspell was as much movie as stage show. The fact that it never really clicked with a mass audience says more about its timing than it does about the value of the film.Godspell came along just as the Broadway Musical was taking its last gasp of fresh air -- and about ten years after the Hollywood Movie Musical had begun to rot in its grave. Not long after Godspell came Bob Fosse's Pippin and a little show from out of nowhere called Grease (since butchered and bowdlerized in its transition to film, and altered even more offensively in its transition back from film to stage); by then, Andrew Lloyd Webber had begun to dig his toes in, and it would not be long before the Brits effectively put us out of our own theaters.If Hair capitalized on the cynical, rebellious side of hippie subculture, Godspell's emphasis was on the sweetness and innocence of that same movement. It began as a college theater project that set the Gospel According to St. Matthew in a modern junkyard, and presented Christ as a heartfaced mime in clown pants and a Superman sweatshirt, leading a company of costumed Flower Children in musical enactments of the parables. As such, even the stage version came about five years too late. Flower Children were already trite stuff for all but those -- like myself -- who had just missed that bus flashing by at psychedelic speed. Godspell had to rise above the Flower Child, and it did so on the charm of Stephen Schwartz's musical score, on a glib mixture of stage technique and most especially on the vitality of its players.By the time of the film's release, the sad old Flower Child was looking horribly, grotesquely pass&eacute;. Godspell was a relic before it ever hit the screen. It's distributor, Columbia Pictures, didn't know how to market the thing. Nor did ABC TV, when they aired the movie, just once, a year later. After that, Godspell dropped out of sight faster than a brick in a murky pond. Its director managed to cop a good career for himself helming television mini-series, notably Rich Man, Poor Man and Roots. Of its actors, only Victor Garber (lately Goldie Hawn's Evil Ex in the film version of The First Wives Club) has carved out anything that remotely resembles name recognition, though a few -- among them Tony Award winning Lynne Thigpen (currently host of the PBS children's series Where in The World is Carmen Sandiego) -- still turn up from time to time in films, commercials and sitcoms.Given that Home Video didn't begin to take off until the mid-to-late eighties, it has still taken better than a decade -- nearly a quarter of a century after its screen release -- for Godspell to finally turn up on video. It is perhaps more difficult to market than ever -- Columbia at first washed its hands of the picture, leaving its video release to a bootlegged version from a company called Bridgestone. Perhaps the bootleg served its purpose by demonstrating to Columbia that there was a market for the film after all: one year later, the studio has finally followed suit with an official video release.In 1973, it was not a movie to suit every taste. That remains true today. Modern viewers are likely to feel as if they have wandered into a Big Hair Convention by mistake. Whatever horror we might experience at the sight of '70s fashions and hairstyles is moderated by the device of setting the action outside of the real world, in a city outside of time, combined with the deliberate eclecticism of the costuming and performance styles; but Godspell is still very much a product of its decade. Nonetheless, its vitality and freshness still shine bright.We love its playfulness, its color and joy; we love its cheerfully talented cast. Some critics, notably Judith Crist, objected to the funny voices, the deliberately broad performances, the skipping, the adults acting patently like children -- but these are essential to Godspell's theme: that we are all children in the face of Eternity, that to renew one's spirit is to become a child again. If that message has no meaning to you, then this is not your movie. If it does have meaning to you, then you need not be a Christian to enjoy what Godspell has to offer.Director Greene brings a full range of film technique to bear on the material, an artist's eye and a dramatist's sensibility. He moves his camera only to achieve deliberate effect, and choreographs his shots as carefully as he does the actors. Joy is a terribly difficult emotion to convey, so easily brushed aside by audiences at the first sign of a false note. Yet Greene and his youthful cast succeed at infusing the entire film with Joy -- it is probably the last great Movie Musical to have been filmed, one of the happiest ever.All that is outrageous eventually becomes established: Godspell and its darker cousin Jesus Christ Superstar were roundly condemned at the time of their release by the religious right, whereas both are now, seemingly, being embraced by the same people. We raise our eyebrows at the thought that religious types are now supporting a film that has the balls to present the Resurrection matter-of-factly as a metaphor, not as a physical event. For several months after we saw Godspell in its initial release, we walked around feeling very high-toned and religious, which seems as silly to us now as all of the marketing heebie-jeebies still surrounding the movie. Godspell the movie has about as much to do with religion as Robert Schuller, which is to say very little. What it really preaches is what the religious right likes to call Secular Humanism -- the Brotherhood of Mankind.But even that message is not the film's primary concern. Godspell is a Director's Movie; just as the stage version was, more than anything else, about theatrical technique and the ways in which old stories can be freshened up with modern presentation, the film version is about the ways that film techniques can be applied to the same end. Renewal is its theme; how appropriate then, that it has been returned to us after all these years.",5,Beautiful City,1037750400,"11 20, 2002",2002,7027,"['Twenty-five', 'years', 'did', 'not', 'admit',

I don't remember much about the experience at all, but then again, I don't remember hating it either.Flash forward to three years later. In honor of the fact that my high school has chosen to throw its students into the world of Godspell this spring (read: it's this year's musical), my theater director decided to show our class the 1973 Victor Garber movie version of Godspell.Everybody has their opinion of this movie. I actually found it to be enjoyable, in a way (then again, the sole fact that it's a musical appeals to me- they grow on me). I was actually capable of having it completely freak me out while at the same time holding my interest. It was nothing like I thought it would be- the songs sound so obviously bible-related that I assumed it would be more direct in the biblical story, instead of just being a group of 70's people wandering around, singing and dancing.The fact that there were no definitive characters threw me off. No one is called by a name in this story. Well, that's sort of a lie: Jesus is called ""Lord"" once. But you know he's Jesus, and that David Haskell is John the Baptist and Judas, by their words, not their names. It seems this is extremely heavily geared toward Christians because it relies on the legendary stories of these people to reach its audience.And it did reach me. I found the crucifixion scene to be rather violent and disturbing, but then realized that in the end, that seems a bit more appropriate then Jesus being gently carried to the cross and put up there and just sitting there until he dies. It probably was nothing like that, and could very well have been as tumultous and catastrophic as the movie suggests.In my mind, there are four categories of a show's power to make you come back. The first is the obsession: the thing that you think about all the time. The second and most common is the good quality: for instance, a TV show that you look forward to each week but don't really miss on the days you don't watch it. You don't feel empty without it because you know it'll be back the next week. The third is an addiction: you don't really have to watch it, you just do it so frequently that when it's not there, you recognize a gap where it was. And the fourth, the category where Godspell belongs, is an impulse. I have incredibly mixed feelings about this movie, but all in all, I am strangely eager to see it again.Be prepared when you watch this for the first time- it's almost impossible to predict what kind of effect it will have. Your feelings may be just as divided as mine. But I can assure you that it will make you think.",3,"Good, although not filled with tons of clarity",1046908800,"03 6, 2003",2003,2743,"['first', 'saw', 'Godspell', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'would', 'make', 'twelve', 'community', 'theater', 'production', 'summer', 'camp', 'leader', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'experience', 'then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'hating', 'either.Flash', 'forward', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'honor', 'fact', 'high', 'school', 'chosen', 'throw', 'students', 'world', 'Godspell', 'spring', 'read', 'year', 'musical', 'theater', 'director', 'decided', 'show', 'class', '1973', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'movie', 'version', 'Godspell.Everybody', 'opinion', 'movie', 'actually', 'found', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'then', 'again', 'sole', 'fact', 'musical', 'appeals', 'me-', 'grow', 'was', 'actually', 'capable', 'having', 'completely', 'freak', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'holding', 'interest', 'was', 'nothing', 'thought', 'would', 'be-', 'songs', 'sound', 'so', 'obviously', 'bible-related', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'direct', 'biblical', 'story', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'group', '70', 'people', 'wandering', 'around', 'singing', 'dancing.The', 'fact', 'were', 'definitive', 'characters', 'threw', 'off', 'one', 'called', 'name', 'story', 'Well', 'sort', 'lie', 'Jesus', 'called', 'Lord', 'once', 'know', 'Jesus', 'David', 'Haskell', 'John', 'Baptist', 'Judas', 'words', 'not', 'names', 'extremely', 'heavily', 'geared', 'Christians', 'legendary', 'stories', 'people', 'reach', 'audience.And', 'did', 'reach', 'found', 'crucifixion', 'scene', 'be', 'rather', 'violent', 'disturbing', 'then', 'realized', 'end', 'bit', 'more', 'appropriate', 'then', 'Jesus', 'being', 'gently', 'carried', 'cross', 'put', 'up', 'there', 'just', 'sitting', 'there', 'probably', 'was', 'nothing', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'tumultous', 'catastrophic', 'movie', 'suggests.In', 'mind', 'are', 'four', 'categories', 'show', 'power', 'make', 'come', 'back', 'first', 'obsession', 'thing', 'think', 'time', 'second', 'most', 'common', 'good', 'quality', 'instance', 'TV', 'show', 'look', 'forward', 'week', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'miss', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'empty', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'next', 'week', 'third', 'addiction', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'watch', 'just', 'do', 'so', 'frequently', 'when', 'not', 'there', 'recognize', 'gap', 'where', 'was', 'fourth', 'category', 'where', 'Godspell', 'belongs', 'impulse', 'have', 'incredibly', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', 'am', 'strangely', 'eager', 'see', 'again.Be', 'prepared', 'when', 'watch', 'first', 'time-', 'almost', 'impossible', 'predict', 'what', 'kind', 'effect', 'will', 'have', 'feelings', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'divided', 'mine', 'can', 'assure', 'will', 'make', 'think']",N/A

I first saw the play as a 15-year-old in 1972 at the Wilbur theater in Boston and was utterly captivated. The play at the time seemed daring and contemporary -- picturing Jesus in clown make-up and Superman t-shirt, inserting a whiff of vampy sexuality into some of the characters, setting up strawman ""establishment"" characters to protest against. Very light on theology (which may have been part of its attraction) Godspell was a welcome antidote to the harsh and sterile Church experiences that were the norm at the time. Godspell presented a Jesus that young people in the counter-culture could relate to, even if the real counter-culture was not terribly interested in cute, folk-inspired music. Godspell gave us a gender- and race-inclusive group of ""cool"" disciples we could imagine ourselves part of, who would be sad when Jesus died and glad when he returned. Godspell's funny/sad Jesus told amusing stories, was young and old (he drank wine!), loved everyone and stood up to the oppressor.For the more theologically inclined, there were questions. What did the writers have in mind (if anything) by melding John the Baptist with Judas Iscariot? And was there a resurrection scene or not? But audiences then and now didn't worry too much about the details. Fun with Jesus was what mattered.The film takes a light touch in translating the theater experience to the big screen. The mugging, clowning, long hair and flea-market clothes are still there. The music is still sweet, charming, and full of achy longing. But music aside, Godspell has not aged well. Young people of the early 21st century are likely to be as put off by the hippy-dippy costuming as their parents were attracted to it. And clowning that doesn't involve dangerous stunts or stuff blowing up (a la ""Jackass"") has completely lost its appeal, except to 4-year olds.For Christians of a certain age (40-60) ""Godspell"" is still a worthwhile nostalgia trip.

My big memories of that era are that everyone else's hair was much longer and shaggier than mine (my choice) and that the clothing styles were colorful but horrid. I was not a particular fan of rock music either. All of these factors are very prominent in this film but it is wonderful in spite of it. In fact, it is wonderful largely because of it.The film is an adaptation of the Gospel of St. Matthew. It takes place in New York City. Victor Garber plays Jesus but does not make any effort to redo the ""life"" of Christ. Instead, it focuses on the teachings. He gathers a group of young followers who listen to his teachings and parables. Often, they enact the stories in a mime, burlesque or Vaudeville style and break into song. They try to make simple points and they do so quite effectively.Part of the effectiveness lies in the style of the time. It uses the excesses of the 60s and 70s to make the simple points. It strips away all of the history and goes straight to the moral teachings. It demonstrates very well that these teaching work well at all times in all places.The disciples are a mixed bunch. They are all young. There are not twelve of them. They are male and female and they each play more than one role. The man who plays John the Baptist also plays Judas the traitor.

At least this was my experience and I have experientially learned that experiential learning is far more valuable than anything else.Was not Jesus a rebel against the traditional religion of authority He grew up with? The protagonist here certainly displays that disposition, symbolically representing the society-rebellion movement of an earlier decade that dared to challenge the Establishment by peacefully proclaiming the liberty of their individuality and the right to freely choose non-violence over violence. Jesus was also into non-violence and non-traditional methods of teaching. He was a supremely cool dude who never scared people with threats of fire and damnation. Many concepts that were never taught by Jesus got absorbed into Christianity long after He had risen from the dead, this resurrection, by the way, certainly being an important plot point in the gospel of Matthew that was unfortunately omitted from this film perhaps for commercial considerations since not everyone believes Jesus conquered Death hence the difference between men and women of faith who believe without seeing and those who choose to see only with their material eyes believing nothing that transcends the reflection of mere light on empty objects before their hollow gaze.And although Jesus displayed a genuine respect for the sacred writings passed down from previous generations, He never paused to let short-term consequences deter Him when His hour came to proclaim the new teaching that God was not only the Father of Israel but also the Father of every man and woman including the wrongdoer and this all-inclusive declaration of spiritually liberating non-exclusivity whereby all of us are God's kids threatened the Chosen People concept of the Jews and even this quasi-comical portrayal of events did not leave out what happened after that happened.",5,A Rebel With A Cause,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,2000,"['believe', 'enough', 'teachings', 'Jesus', 'movie', 'truths', 'spoken', 'universal', 'language', 'music', 'lead', 'one', 'closer', 'God', 'least', 'was', 'experience', 'have', 'experientially', 'learned', 'experiential', 'learning', 'far', 'more', 'valuable', 'anything', 'else.Was', 'not', 'Jesus', 'rebel', 'traditional', 'religion', 'authority', 'grew', 'up', 'protagonist', 'here', 'certainly', 'disposition', 'symbolically', 'representing', 'society-rebellion', 'movement', 'earlier', 'decade', 'dared', 'challenge', 'Establishment', 'peacefully', 'proclaiming', 'liberty', 'individuality', 'right', 'freely', 'choose', 'non-violence', 'violence', 'Jesus', 'was', 'also', 'non-violence', 'non-traditional', 'methods', 'teaching', 'was', 'supremely', 'cool', 'dude', 'who', 'never', 'scared', 'people', 'threats', 'fire', 'damnation', 'Many', 'concepts', 'were', 'never', 'taught', 'Jesus', 'got', 'absorbed', 'Christianity', 'long', 'had', 'risen', 'dead', 'resurrection', 'way', 'certainly', 'being', 'important', 'plot', 'point', 'gospel', 'Matthew', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'omitted', 'film', 'perhaps', 'commercial', 'considerations', 'not', 'everyone', 'Jesus', 'conquered', 'Death', 'hence', 'difference', 'men', 'women', 'faith', 'who', 'believe', 'seeing', 'who', 'choose', 'see', 'only', 'material', 'eyes', 'believing', 'nothing', 'reflection', 'mere', 'light', 'empty', 'objects', 'hollow', 'gaze.And', 'Jesus', 'displayed', 'genuine', 'respect', 'sacred', 'writings', 'passed', 'down', 'previous', 'generations', 'never', 'paused', 'let', 'short-term', 'consequences', 'deter', 'Him', 'when', 'hour', 'came', 'proclaim', 'new', 'teaching', 'God', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'Father', 'Israel', 'also', 'Father', 'man', 'woman', 'including', 'wrongdoer', 'all-inclusive', 'declaration', 'spiritually', 'liberating', 'non-exclusivity', 'whereby', 'are', 'God', 'kids', 'threatened', 'Chosen', 'People', 'concept', 'Jews', 'even', 'quasi-comical', 'portrayal', 'events', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'happened']",N/A

It uses a small cast to act out various parables and stories from the life of Christ.  Interspersed are songs inspired by the events the cast has been reenacting.This movie musical has several drawbacks.  The biggest is that it is obviously a 70's musical.  The costumes and arrangements just scream it out.  The second is a personal pet peeve.  They removed the song &quot;We Beseech Thee&quot; and added the song &quot;Beautiful City.&quot;  I've tried, but I just don't think it's a good substitute.  Third, the &quot;crucifixion&quot; scene is almost laughable in this version.  Lastly, with the small cast, everyone but Jesus plays multiple &quot;rolls&quot; in the overall story.  This can be very confusing and often interrupts the message that segment was trying to get across.In my mind, the positives out way the negatives, however.  The cast is obviously having fun with the material and each other, which makes the movie more enjoyable.  There are many good songs, including my favorites &quot;God Save the People&quot; and &quot;Day by Day.&quot;  The video choreography for &quot;All For the Best&quot; and &quot;Light of the World&quot; are imaginative as well.

19396,A2R6RA8FRBS608,0767827929,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[9, 9]","Godspell retains its energetic force decades after its cinematic release. Godspell tells the story of Jesus and his followers--only with a highly creative twist. Instead of the action taking place in the Middle East thousands of years ago, the backdrop scenes are from the then modern day (1970s) Manhattan. Jesus' followers and even Jesus himself are dressed as hippies; and although the costumes are dated the emotional impact and the artistic quality never suffer. Godspell takes its subject matter and infuses it with a flawlessly beautiful score by Stephen Schwartz; and the actors work so hard to make the story come alive. They succeed.The action begins with John Haskell playing John the Baptist crossing a bridge into Manhattan; and soon he beckons to people to meet him in Central Park for a group baptism. Jesus first appears in the Central Park baptism scene; and from the word go Victor Garber plays Jesus as an energetic, enthusiastic young man who loves God with all his heart. John the Baptist and the other people form a group with Jesus as their leader. As a group Jesus and his followers, who are now dressed as hippies, re-enact several parables and passages from the Bible.During the numerous scenes that ensue we get some of the most wonderful, delightfully arranged musical numbers I've ever witnessed on screen. Robin Lamont's ""Day By Day"" moves me with its beauty; the simplistic lyrics coupled with a beautiful, folk music style arrangement stand out as a musical highlight of this film. Lynne Thigpen performs a marvelous rendition of ""O Bless the Lord My Soul"" with all her heart; Lynne's acting as a follower of Christ remains convincing and impressive throughout Godspell. In addition, Joanne Jonas turns in a great performance as a follower of Jesus who helps to highlight Jesus' disdain of comparatively superficial things that materialistic people crave. Excellent!Look also for an excellent Last Supper scene in which Jesus hands out the bread and wine after blessing it using traditional Hebrew prayers to bless bread and wine. The Last Supper scene is very tastefully done.Of course, Jesus' ministry ends tragically with his betrayal by Judas, who is also played by David Haskell. I agree with the reviewer who writes that it's good that David Haskell plays both John the Baptist and Judas--it does indeed demonstrate how there's good and bad in every human being. Jesus is crucified in a Manhattan junkyard while his followers weep for him; and the next day they carry Jesus' body through the empty streets of Manhattan while singing upbeat numbers from the score. This would appear to imply that Jesus will be resurrected.Choreography doesn't get any better than this: the numerous musical numbers are carefully staged and the timing amongst all the cast members remains flawless throughout the movie. It is a bit eerie to see them dancing on the top of the former World Trade Center; but they dance there so ably it's truly remarkable. Cinematography also shines with the panoramic views of Manhattan with streets both crowded and empty; and all the characters are well framed within the picture frame to create an even stronger impact on viewers.Overall, I highly recommend Godspell as a prime example of how artistic creativity can take a story thousands of years old and breathe new life into it as if it were actually happening in the here and now. The acting by Victor Garber and company leaves nothing to be desired; and the musical numbers reflect extreme attention to detail and great thoughtfulness. It's not a movie for very young children, primarily because of the crucifixion scene; but otherwise there's no reason not to see this movie and enjoy it over and over again.",5,fun musical exploring Biblical passages and the story of Christ,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,3721,"['Godspell', 'energetic', 'force', 'decades', 'cinematic', 'release', 'Godspell', 'story', 'Jesus', 'followers', 'only', 'highly', 'creative', 'twist', 'Instead', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'Middle', 'East', 'thousands', 'years', 'ago', 'backdrop', 'scenes', 'are', 'then', 'modern', 'day', '1970s', 'Manhattan', 'Jesus', 'followers', 'even', 'Jesus', 'are', 'dressed', 'hippies', 'costumes', 'are', 'dated', 'emotional', 'impact', 'artistic', 'quality', 'never', 'suffer', 'Godspell', 'subject', 'matter', 'flawlessly', 'beautiful', 'score', 'Stephen', 'Schwartz', 'actors', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'story', 'come', 'alive', 'succeed.The', 'action', 'John', 'Haskell', 'playing', 'John', 'Baptist', 'crossing', 'bridge', 'Manhattan', 'soon', 'people', 'meet', 'Central', 'Park', 'group', 'baptism', 'Jesus', 'first', 'Central', 'Park', 'baptism', 'scene', 'word', 'go', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Jesus', 'energetic', 'enthusiastic', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'God', 'heart', 'John', 'Baptist', 'other', 'people', 'form', 'group', 'Jesus', 'leader', 'group', 'Jesus', 'followers', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'dressed', 'hippies', 're-enact', 'several', 'parables', 'passages', 'Bible.During', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'ensue', 'get', 'most', 'wonderful', 'delightfully', 'arranged', 'musical', 'numbers', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witnessed', 'screen', 'Robin', 'Lamont', 'Day', 'Day', 'beauty', 'simplistic', 'lyrics', 'coupled', 'beautiful', 'folk', 'music', 'style', 'arrangement', 'stand', 'out', 'musical', 'highlight', 'film', 'Lynne', 'Thigpen', 'marvelous', 'rendition', 'O', 'Bless', 'Lord', 'My', 'Soul', 'heart', 'Lynne', 'acting', 'follower', 'Christ', 'convincing', 'impressive', 'Godspell', 'addition', 'Joanne', 'Jonas', 'great', 'performance', 'follower', 'Jesus', 'who', 'highlight', 'Jesus', 'disdain', 'comparatively', 'superficial', 'things', 'materialistic', 'people', 'crave', 'Excellent', 'Look', 'also', 'excellent', 'Last', 'Supper', 'scene', 'Jesus', 'out', 'bread', 'wine', 'blessing', 'using', 'traditional', 'Hebrew', 'prayers', 'bless', 'bread', 'wine', 'Last', 'Supper', 'scene', 'very', 'tastefully', 'done.Of', 'course', 'Jesus', 'ministry', 'tragically', 'betrayal', 'Judas', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'David', 'Haskell', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'good', 'David', 'Haskell', 'John', 'Baptist', 'Judas', 'indeed', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'good', 'bad', 'human', 'being', 'Jesus', 'crucified', 'Manhattan', 'junkyard', 'followers', 'weep', 'next', 'day', 'carry', 'Jesus', 'body', 'empty', 'streets', 'Manhattan', 'singing', 'upbeat', 'numbers', 'score', 'would', 'appear', 'imply', 'Jesus', 'will', 'be', 'resurrected.Choreography', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'numerous', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'carefully', 'staged', 'timing', 'amongst', 'cast', 'members', 'flawless', 'movie', 'bit', 'eerie', 'see', 'dancing', 'top', 'former', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'dance', 'there', 'so', 'ably', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'Cinematography', 'also', 'panoramic', 'views', 'Manhattan', 'streets', 'crowded', 'empty', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'framed', 'picture', 'frame', 'create', 'even', 'stronger', 'impact', 'viewers.Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Godspell', 'prime', 'example', 'how', 'artistic', 'creativity', 'can', 'take', 'story', 'thousands', 'years', 'old', 'breathe', 'new', 'life', 'were', 'actually', 'happening', 'here', 'now', 'acting', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'company', 'nothing', 'be', 'desired', 'musical', 'numbers', 'reflect', 'extreme', 'attention', 'detail', 'great', 'thoughtfulness', 'not', 'movie', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'primarily', 'crucifixion', 'scene', 'otherwise', 'reason', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'over', 'again']",N/A

I thought I would hate this movie because I'd been hearing nothing but bad things about it. ""It's weird. The choreography looks like it was done on the spot."" I loved every minute of it. It never even hit me that these people were running around an abandoned New York. It's possible for New York to be empty like that sometimes if the day is particularly lazy. One of the most moving moments was the shot of the World Trade Center. When you saw that shot, it seemed almost prophetic. It was as if the cinematographer knew he wouldn't see it again. It's a great movie. You should see it sometime. I loved it.

19401,A17UC91G2697HP,0767827929,NoFear6061,"[3, 4]","I saw this movie for the first time after I did ""Godspell"" in high school, and I thought it was a pretty good movie, but I was amazed how much I felt ""dazed and confused"" during it. First of all, my high school did not do the ""clown"" theme with Jesus in a Superman shirt and all that, so this was my first time seeing the original 1971 concept. I thought it was pretty good, but amazingly outdated. It just doesn't work anymore, it seems too far out of place. This taking place in the 70's, many things were funnier than they are now, and so some, actually, most, of the the comedy wasn't funny. The major thing I'm talking about is Jerry and his high, cartoonish voice that he does for 90% of the film. It just got annoying. Another character I wasn't always so happy about was Judas. David Haskell just doesn't seem really into it. He wasn't annoying, but I just didn't like him as much as I did with him just being a voice on my CD. Also, I know I'm not allowed to, but I also got annoyed with how HAPPY the cast were. I mean, except for the pharasee scene and the finale, they were always SO incredibly happy....Also, playing the Jeffery character in high school, I was really disappointed when they cut ""We Beseech Thee"" and ""Learn Your Lessons Well"" for the film. I mean, both are good, high-sprited songs, and people would of enjoyed them in the movie just as much as on the stage. But oh, well, we did get ""Beautiful City"" instead. These were the bad points of the film, at least for me.But for the good points, I must say the best thing in the film is the soundtrack. I enjoyed the music much more here then with the original Broadway cast. Lamar's ""All Good Gifts"" was just too much, and Merrell's version was great. ""Day by Day"" sounds the best here, not on the video, but the SONG does. Also, Lynne Thigpen NAILS, I mean, NAILS ""Bless the Lord"" and she sounds GREAT on it. Also, ""Beautiful City"" does make you smile. Buy the CD soundtrack with this movie. You may like it better than the Boradway Cast CD. But besides the soundtrack, I also enjoyed the sense of friendship the cast has. I know I said earlier that they seem TOO happy, but it's good that they do. It shows they really are friends, and when Jesus (played almost awkwardly by Victor Garber, who will keep you thinking only about him being Mr. Andrews in ""Titanic"" while you watch him) dies, you'll really care, and seeing the disciples scream on the fence at the end will make you almost cry. Finally, I love the photography of the film. It's amazing how they seem to totally desert New York City for the film. I was surprised how awesome it looked. And them fitting in the Prodigal Son scene inside the Cherry Lane Theatre, where ""Godspell"" was first performed, is just a cool thing to do.Overall, this IS a good movie, sadly ignored by moviegoers in 1973.

It was the unusual interaction between stage actors and audience, as if the audience completed the performance with the interaction of clapping, laughing, and even being led to sing along. It was an interactive performance which made it so special as a stage show. Performers even served wine to audience during half time, which was signaled by a lyric to end of first half song. ""We're gonna drink some wine!""All that left a definite impression.The movie has no audience to play to during filming other than production crew, so they must interact with themselves to drum up the same flamboyant energy to convey to a later audience This is rather difficult and it's obvious they must really ham things up to keep the momentum going for the camera & crewmen.The production reminds me of The Wiz motion picture as cast performs throughout revisions of the big apple.The songs are, of course, excellent, but they are out of context. The intertwining vaudeville acts fall flat as none has the real spark to produce genuine comedy. This should enlighten those to how difficult it is to produce vaudevillian comedy on film, such as The Three Stooges who were masters of that genre in cinema.

Of course, I was 13 then and rock musicals were something new and different. It was one of those films that pointed me in the direction of Musical Theatre performance and direction.Watching it recently as a reference for a production I am directing and choreographing, I found it to be trite, dated, missing large portions of the musical itself, and just so terribly dated it was of little reference value for a modern production of the show.There are some things I still love -- the cast (I can imitate half of the facial expressions on command); the songs; the whimsy. I do love that they replaced We Beseech Thee with Beautiful City -- a change not permitted for current productions, and a prettier song at a clumsy transition point in the stage musical.But watching the movie is almost impossible without cringing now -- the orchestrations are terrible, the videography dated, the colors washed out. Victor Garber looks more effeminate now than he did when I was 13, of course, but it detracts from the overall taste. NYC looks dirty, dingy, and...well...smelly in this movie.

The city of New York is seemingly abandoned to provide a fresh-faced, winning troupe of young people looking for something meaningful in their lives a place in which to play, laugh, run, skip, jump, and most of all, sing and dance.  This concept is outrageously creative, and for fans of the music and show, delightfully wonderful.

Present it with a light, even comic touch. That's what you get in this film musical version of the Broadway play Godspell. Appropriately, as the time of Jesus betrayal and death approaches, the humor falls away and things get serious; and by that time the viewer has been completely drawn in by the wonderful music and creatively conceived visual presentation.I recall being bowled over when I saw this film just by chance during a 'snow day' at a New York high school where I was teaching at the time. I had no previous experience of it because of having seen and greatly disliking 'Jesus Christ Superstar'. Why did I respond so positively to this film? It was the wonderful music that drew me into the story and to this day I still put on the CD to listen to it from time to time. Many of the songs are excellent: romantic to the core. Visually the story counterpoints the most local run down urban areas with the most glamorous and overpowering  scenes of 'the city of man.'In short, as music, it is a wonderful experience; as picture, it is at times creatively overpowering; as gospel story, it uses the back door to remind us that there is still something there that can be of import even in these post modern times.

Set in modern-day (ca. 1973) New York City, with characters dressed in costumes that resemble the characters of ""Hair"" more than the Bible. However, looks can be deceiving, and the movie is a fun, joyous musical journey that stays closer to the the Biblical personages than the more well-known ""Jesus Christ Superstar.""Victor Garber, stars of such films and shows as ""Titanic,"" ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Alias,"" makes his film debut as Jesus, and it is a great performance. The supporting cast is magnificent, and the story does a good job of condensing the 28 chapters of Matthew into 103 minutes in fun and emotional ways. The songs are very upbeat, and have a quality to them that the viewer can't help but sing along to.Of course, as in the Gospels, the story must come to an emotional climax, and the scenes of Jesus' torment and crucifixion are handled well, and you can't help but cry for Jesus as he dies on the cross. But while the Resurrection is not seen onscreen, the uplifting songs at the very end hint of things to come. Overall, this is a great musical film that people of all ages can enjoy, though small children may find the scenes at the end a bit too much for them.Movie/DVD Grade: A-",5,"A FUN, JOYFUL TRIP THROUGH THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW!

Barty ""Fab Fan""","[0, 0]","The greatest stories are those that can be told using the simplest means, and surely the story of Jesus Christ, our Savior, is the greatest. Godspell tells this story in simple, accessible and very hip terms.A travelling actor, in hippie attire, arrives in New York and takes the role of John the Baptist, calling various discontented New Yorkers who are tired of the hustle and bustle, to be Baptised and renewed. Another actor represting Jesus Christ arrives and asks to be Baptised. As they do this in a public fountain, they are renewed and transform into hippie outfits with costume-box style flourishes to tell the story of Jesus's message, his parables and his last days using simples props, fantastic songs and the New York environment.The costumes and locations are fitting for each of the lessons and songs - and it is all a lot of fun. The old cinema used for the story of the Prodigal Son is a good example. The actors make excellent clowns and vaudevillians and each are sincere and work well as an ensemble.
