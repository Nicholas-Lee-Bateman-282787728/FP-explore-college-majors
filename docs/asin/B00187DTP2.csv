In fact, it's the most realistic horror movie I have ever seen and I've seen over 1000 horror movies! It could easily be real! I really don't get why it has such a low rating on IMDB... If you can't handle realistic violence, don't watch a fake snuff movie, idiots! Anyway, it's not entertaining in any way, but it's not supposed to be, it's supposed to be shocking and it REALLY is. It's definitely one of the sickest movies ever!You ""like"" sick and/or disturbing movies? Watch it and Penance, but I really don't recommend Mordum! It's *beep* crazy, depraved, vile, sick, disgusting, evil and etc... etc... etc... like everyone says, but it's also unrealistic (it's just too over-the-top) and boring as hell! Yeah, it has a lot of really messed up *beep* that should be disturbing, but it all feels like the makers told themselves ""let's film the most depraved acts of sex and violence ever (even if they're totally unbelievable) and show people how depraved we are"" and because of that, it just doesn't feel serious and it's not disturbing. It feels like a gross-out contest.

1158544,A2XU3L553413PO,B00187DTP2,Daniel Camhi,"[0, 0]","TRUE HORROR. THE MOVIE THAT STARTED IT ALL FOR ME. THIS MOVIE INFLUENCED, INSPIRED, AND REVIVED THE HORROR (AND GORE) GENRE FOREVER!!!I am disgusted at some of the reviews here on amazon for the August Underground and the trilogy. This movie is obviously not for everyone (and kind of hard to find) so I am surprised to see such harsh reviews from people who ""apparently"" stumbled onto these films. Fred Vogel, first and foremost, is a makeup/prosthetic artist who was even an instructor at the famous Tom Savini school for horror makeup. I mean the guy is as legit as they come. He is a true film fan. Like most of us horror lovers he loves to see gore. Let me rephrase that...he likes to see the gore done RIGHT!!! So much that he spent his life learning how to be the absolute best at doing this for fans like us. And that he has become...the best. Period. His attention to detail is the absolute best you can find in gore fx. His ability to work on a small budget and give a REAL movie is incredible. Now I will say I have watched a couple other films by Fred that have not been as good as these, but how can you top something that is so perfect and can never be touched on its level? I am not writing this review to tell you about what happens in the movie. This movie is much more effective without knowing the details going in. What I CAN tell you is that if you are looking for something to disturb you...to sicken you...to terrify you with its reality...this is the movie you need to see. The most accurate and honest depiction of murder/serial killing that I have ever seen. To be honest it's probably the most accurate depiction that even exists. It's holds nothing back. The movie is so real that the main characters may sound like YOU at times (not specifically during the killings or anything just in general). Sometimes even their actions and jaded behavior can make you laugh a bit yourself inside. This terrifies you even more because that's when you realize that these people can be ordinary people like you and me...but capable of such extraordinary evil. I promise if you are a fan of gore, torture, extreme violence, disturbing content, anything like that...this will be your all time favorite movie and trilogy. It will never get old. It will always be as horrifying with each viewing if not more. Do yourself a favor watch them in order. It's the way they were meant to be seen. And please if you haven't seen these films, prepare yourself for the nastiest guiltiest pleasure you've ever feasted your eyes on. Pure cinematic horror. Pure genius.",5,Please don't listen to the bad reviews!!!,1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,2568,"['TRUE', 'HORROR', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'THAT', 'STARTED', 'IT', 'ALL', 'FOR', 'ME', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'INFLUENCED', 'INSPIRED', 'AND', 'REVIVED', 'THE', 'HORROR', 'AND', 'GORE', 'GENRE', 'FOREVER', 'am', 'disgusted', 'reviews', 'here', 'amazon', 'August', 'Underground', 'trilogy', 'movie', 'obviously', 'not', 'everyone', 'kind', 'hard', 'find', 'so', 'am', 'surprised', 'see', 'such', 'harsh', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'apparently', 'stumbled', 'films', 'Fred', 'Vogel', 'first', 'foremost', 'makeup/prosthetic', 'artist', 'who', 'was', 'even', 'instructor', 'famous', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'school', 'horror', 'makeup', 'mean', 'guy', 'as', 'legit', 'come', 'true', 'film', 'fan', 'most', 'horror', 'lovers', 'see', 'gore', 'Let', 'rephrase', 'see', 'gore', 'done', 'RIGHT', 'So', 'much', 'spent', 'life', 'learning', 'how', 'be', 'absolute', 'best', 'doing', 'fans', 'become', 'best', 'Period', 'attention', 'detail', 'absolute', 'best', 'can', 'find', 'gore', 'fx', 'ability', 'work', 'small', 'budget', 'give', 'REAL', 'movie', 'incredible', 'Now', 'will', 'say', 'have', 'watched', 'couple', 'other', 'films', 'Fred', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'how', 'can', 'top', 'something', 'so', 'perfect', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'touched', 'level', 'am', 'not', 'writing', 'review', 'tell', 'what', 'movie', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'knowing', 'details', 'going', 'What', 'CAN', 'tell', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'disturb', 'sicken', 'terrify', 'reality', 'movie', 'need', 'see', 'most', 'accurate', 'honest', 'depiction', 'murder/serial', 'killing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'be', 'honest', 'probably', 'most', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'even', 'nothing', 'back', 'movie', 'so', 'real', 'main', 'characters', 'may', 'sound', 'YOU', 'times', 'not', 'specifically', 'killings', 'anything', 'just', 'general', 'Sometimes', 'even', 'actions', 'jaded', 'behavior', 'can', 'make', 'bit', 'inside', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'realize', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'ordinary', 'people', 'capable', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'evil', 'promise', 'are', 'fan', 'gore', 'torture', 'extreme', 'violence', 'disturbing', 'content', 'anything', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'favorite', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'old', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'horrifying', 'viewing', 'not', 'more', 'Do', 'favor', 'watch', 'order', 'way', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'please', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'films', 'prepare', 'nastiest', 'guiltiest', 'pleasure', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'feasted', 'eyes', 'Pure', 'cinematic', 'horror', 'Pure', 'genius']",Fred Vogel's AUGUST UNDERGROUND

You take it home and sit in your comfortable chair and on this DVD is some home video footage of someone pouring a beer out, the quality is rough and the photography is shaky.  You see another character come into view and then you are walking down some stairs into a basement and when the light is turned on you see...That's the movie, period.  Except what you see after that 20 seconds will have you squirming in your seat, as you see graphic murder and rape and stuff too vile to speak about here.  That's the plot of the film.  2 serial killers stalking and killing and laughing about it all. The rest of the 70 minutes is simply murder and mayhem but it's shot like you are watching someone's home video.  I watched the 3rd August Underground Penance DVD before seeing this one but it really doesn't matter the order you see them in, they are all similar and don't necessarily have to be viewed in order.You follow killers around that have no compassion and are simply out on a ""killing"" streak.  I have to say that the 3rd one I think is a little better than this one but both feature similar material.  It's very well done and the reason for that is that Fred Vogel (the director, writer, killer etc) was a teacher at the Tom Savini school in Pennsylvania so you'll see very graphic special effects and they only get better as you go through the series.  This is not for everyone.  If you are looking for plot, don't look here.  If you are looking for great characterizations, don't look here.  If you are looking to see the most depraved (almost snuff like movie ever made) you are looking in the right place!That is what you'll get, everything I heard about this film series is exactly what everyone has said it was going to be.  This is what you could classify as Transgressive Cinema, that's the only way to describe it, leave your morals at the door and expect to be shocked. If this is not your cup of tea then I would strongly advise you don't see it.I gave it 5 stars because this is the first time that all of the hype actually lived up to what was displayed.  The DVD has a TON of extras and I bought the Special Edition with 2 DVD's and it has a couple of different director's commentaries and is full of previews of other ToeTag Pictures films.If your into the extreme you won't be disappointed, if you aren't, steer clear.  When I get August Underground 2 - Mordam, I'll review it.  That one is supposed to be the most depraved of the entire trilogy. I'm ready!",5,Is this a lost home video?
