Sure some of the dialogue is inane, some of the actors overact, and the direction uses too many cliche's (seems like everybody is either smoking, drinking, having sex or taking drugs in every scene).Perhaps it is a reflection of the decadence and decline of the american civilization as a whole.  But this film isn't totally without merit.  While there are bad elements to it, I didn't find anything particularly terrible.  The older actors provided the best acting, imo.  And of course, I don't know why Joanna Going wasn't in the credits as her presence was basically heavy in the latter half of the film.  You do at least get the feeling that you are looking at a slice of midwest americana if nothing elseI will also say that this is one of the most sparse DVD's I've ever scene in terms of extras.  I guess the producers or manufacturer figured that the market for this film was too small to justify too many extras.",3,A film that tries to be cool without being dark,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,1039,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'based', 'reviews', 'here', 'have', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'worse', 'movies', 'Sure', 'dialogue', 'inane', 'actors', 'overact', 'direction', 'too', 'many', 'cliche', 'everybody', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'having', 'sex', 'taking', 'drugs', 'scene', 'reflection', 'decadence', 'decline', 'american', 'civilization', 'whole', 'film', ""n't"", 'totally', 'merit', 'are', 'bad', 'elements', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'particularly', 'terrible', 'older', 'actors', 'provided', 'best', 'acting', 'imo', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Joanna', 'Going', 'was', ""n't"", 'credits', 'presence', 'was', 'basically', 'heavy', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'do', 'least', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'looking', 'slice', 'midwest', 'americana', 'nothing', 'elseI', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'sparse', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'scene', 'terms', 'extras', 'guess', 'producers', 'manufacturer', 'figured', 'market', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'small', 'justify', 'too', 'many', 'extras']",Keys to Tulsa VHS

The story, however, isn`t that great, turning into an average betrayal plot that doesn`t bring nothing new or too memorable, and is a bit too slow. Some good moments still occur, though, and the acting is alright, with talents like Eric Stoltz, James Spader, Mary Tyler Moore and even a then unnoticed Cameron Diaz. So, &quot;Keys To Tulsa&quot; is a decent indie movie that`s neither too surprising nor too disappointing, another one to watch at a rainy night.",2,Who Wants To Be Quentin Tarantino?,1075680000,"02 2, 2004",2004,659,"['movie', 'seemed', 'suffer', 'quot', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'quot', 'effect', 'pretty', 'much', 'relies', 'attitude', 'cool', 'badass', 'characters', 'stylish', 'cinematography', 'edgy', 'music', 'give', 'mood', 'story', 'however', 'isn', 't', 'great', 'turning', 'average', 'betrayal', 'plot', 'doesn', 't', 'bring', 'nothing', 'new', 'too', 'memorable', 'bit', 'too', 'slow', 'good', 'moments', 'still', 'occur', 'though', 'acting', 'alright', 'talents', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'James', 'Spader', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'even', 'then', 'unnoticed', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'So', 'quot', 'Keys', 'Tulsa', 'quot', 'decent', 'indie', 'movie', 's', 'too', 'surprising', 'too', 'disappointing', 'one', 'watch', 'rainy', 'night']",Keys to Tulsa VHS

427781,ANOGMDG460PA4,6304539444,inDUHvidual,"[1, 1]","Reinventing the wheel is not the priority of this little straight-to-video from 96'. The ""Key"" point in me seeing this movie was Joanna Going. Who surprisingly to know was around 34 when she made this movie, as she looks more like 24. Adding insult to her great performance, despite her large role was that her name nor picture is anywhere to be found on the DVD.Meanwhile, Cameron Diaz who only has a cameo that lasts a few minutes at the beginning of the film has second billing, and a huge spot on the front cover. So don't buy this movie for her if your a fan she's barely in this one.Keys To Tulsa spends most of its two-hour length teetering on the brink of being a convoluted mess, but the wit and charm of the script and the cast combine to make it a worthwhile watch. There are a lot of characters with a lot of back story, and at times it's easy to forget who has done what to whom.Still, I'd check it out if only to catch a glimpse of Joanna Going who is the hot point of this otherwise respectable movie.",4,This ones for fun folks,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,1016,"['Reinventing', 'wheel', 'not', 'priority', 'little', 'straight-to-video', '96', 'Key', 'point', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'Joanna', 'Going', 'Who', 'surprisingly', 'know', 'was', '34', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'more', '24', 'Adding', 'insult', 'great', 'performance', 'large', 'role', 'was', 'name', 'picture', 'anywhere', 'be', 'found', 'DVD.Meanwhile', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'who', 'only', 'cameo', 'few', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'film', 'second', 'billing', 'huge', 'spot', 'front', 'cover', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'fan', 'barely', 'one.Keys', 'Tulsa', 'most', 'two-hour', 'length', 'teetering', 'brink', 'being', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'wit', 'charm', 'script', 'cast', 'combine', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'are', 'lot', 'characters', 'lot', 'back', 'story', 'times', 'easy', 'forget', 'who', 'done', 'what', 'whom.Still', ""'d"", 'check', 'out', 'only', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'Joanna', 'Going', 'who', 'hot', 'point', 'otherwise', 'respectable', 'movie']",Keys to Tulsa VHS
427782,A1LBBULBEREVEF,6304539444,Kathy Fennessy,"[7, 11]","Just how bad can a movie starring James Coburn (who would win the Oscar for ""Affliction,"" also 1997), Mary Tyler Moore, Eric Stoltz, James Spader and Deborah Unger (more effective as a married couple in ""Crash""), Michael Rooker (""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer""), Joanna Going and, in a bit part, a pre-""There's Something About Mary"" Cameron Diaz be? Far worse  than I thought. I have no idea why these actors, who've all done better work elsewhere, would have agreed to star in such a stinker. Easily one of the more inept entries in the overcrowded post-""Pulp Fiction"" dying-to-be-hip black comic neo-noir derby.Stoltz, saddled with a bad haircut and the unfortunate name of Richter Boudreau, is completely miscast as a reporter who mostly just walks around with his shirt open, and his love scenes with Vicky (Unger) and Cherry (Going) are pretty tepid, especially in the scene where Going's punk rock stripper character drags herself over a plate of sausage and eggs en route to a morning quickie (can you say yuck?).And the film isn't even half as interesting as I've made it sound! Cinematography and soundtrack are competent, but the story doesn't make sense, dialogue is DOA, characters uninteresting, direction listless, and actors bored. Only some morbid and compulsive form of curiosity kept me going until the very end.
