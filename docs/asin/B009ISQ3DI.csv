My family and I sat down to view it and it immediately drew us in. We LOVE watching films like this. Darren Wilson and his team have traveled the world to find out who God truly is. I know to me as a child I thought God was a tall, very old man with long, flowing white hair and a long, white beard carrying a staff. But as I have grown in my spiritual walk as well as growing more mature I have a more personal relationship with Him.My Father is my friend, my secret keeper. The One I can depend on always when things are going well or when things aren't. He is ever faithful and always near. The Wanderlust team has done a great job on showing us that a stronger, more intimate relationship with God is possible. He is always wanting us close to Him. We are to revere and respect Him but above all I think He wants us to love Him. He is our Daddy after all and isn't that what all Dad's want us to do?I like alot of the stories I heard on the film but the main one that I liked was the one about Ravi. What an amazing man of God this man is. I would love to meet him in person one day. He really has made a big impact on my family. This man is an excellent follower of Christ. We should all strive to go about God's work just as he has done.You know God just wants to love us. We serve a mighty God that comes to us no matter what the situation only to love us and draw us closer to Him.""Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in hope that I would mention it on my blog.

But I have to share about this review that almost wasn't and the amazing way God works.I've been reviewing products for this particular company for only a short while.  I've signed up for a few reviews and enjoyed the products I've seen.  When I read the advertisement, I thought this DVD looked intriguing.So I signed up for the review and promptly forgot.  A week or so ago I received the DVD in the mail.  I read the back cover, thought ""Hmm, this looks interesting.  I wonder why I'm getting this?"" and shelved it to watch and figure out later.  Then I received a reminder email about this review.  So, I remembered signing up and proceeded to watch the DVD.I can think of many words to describe how I feel after watching- inspired, convicted, overwhelmed, awed, blessed.  But none of them can truly come close to the impact that watching this film had.I have been a Christian almost my entire life.  I was raised in a Christian home and brought up in church and a Christian school.  I come from a fairly conservative church background- no charismatic here.  In my church it's usually not even okay to clap.  And when we first started a contemporary service, heaven help those folks who raised their arms while we sang.Even though I've ""loosened up"" quite a bit, this film challenged quite a few of my preconceived notions.  It blew them out of the water.This is a very well-done documentary style film that examines our relationship with our Father Who is the Light.  I was drawn in from the beginning and captured as I watched.I want to share it.  I want to let everyone I know see it.  I've been touched and inspired and convicted.  I've been moved.I know it was no accident that I ""stumbled upon"" this review opportunity.  I'm very thankful for Darren Wilson and his crew that created this film.  I can definitely give this one 5 stars (or more).  I plan to let my children watch it,  but there are some moments that may be too intense for some audiences, so screen it first.

1597041,A13HUHXEQPX3YI,B009ISQ3DI,Lightning TigerFists,"[1, 1]","This film contained several amazing stories of Christians sacrificially serving and loving others with incredible faith. At points, it focused me on the love of the Father for His children. Those aspects were both inspiring and convicting.My issue with the film was that woven into the stories were two things that gave me pause:The first concern I had was that the film immediately drew a false dichotomy between God's holiness and his grace, and seemed to suggest that as believers we have no right to alert non-Christians to the reality of the separation that their sin has created between them and God, or God's wrath, or God's displeasure with their willful rejection of his Son. In fact, it asserted that all people, redeemed or not, are ""children of God"", and that our commonality with the lost rests on that basis. That notion is flatly at odds with Scripture. It also implied that those who preach on judgment are being disobedient and unloving, and that they are actually an impediment to the Gospel. I think we need to be wise/sensitive/Spirit-led about how we present the Good News in different settings with different people, but to suggest that pointing to God's holiness and wrath is categorically wrong is dangerous and unbiblical.My second concern was the parade of cameos by leaders in the Charismatic movement, and the conflating of these figures and their rather esoteric doctrinal postures with the more doctrinally uncontroversial, loving, attractive stories I mentioned previously. Because the more alarming aspects of the activities of these figures went completely unremarked upon, I can only assume this was an intentional decision on the part of the filmmakers to disarm viewers and consequently to interest them in those ministries. Yet visit the website of Doug Addison, one of the featured prophetic types, and you'll find content that is (barely) one step removed from popular celebrity psychics.There's a long section with street healer Todd White. I'll just say this. Jesus restored a man's visually withered hand to wholeness. He made leprosy disappear. He called a decomposing dead man out of the tomb. In public. Immediately. ""Healers"" of the kind featured here spend an inordinate amount of time healing bad backs, sore knees, chronic headaches, bad eyesight, and poor hearing. Always maladies that are not visual in nature. I went to see a well-known ""healer"" one time, and I observed something interesting. The license plates in the parking lot were from all over the country, so people were obviously desperate and traveling for help. All of the individuals with visible impairments were kept off to the side of the stage, and never called up. They were prayed for privately. Those on the stage? Bad backs, bad hearing, sore shoulders, etc.God is an infinite being with prerogatives.

By thoughtfully documenting the stories of extraordinary believers and candidly filming miracles, visions and other supernatural occurrences, Wilson engages viewers in modern day examples of the true nature and character of God.Wilson gives honest access to his own spiritual questions as he tackles the religious misconceptions he has struggled with throughout his life.  ""I went into making this film by asking the simple question: who is God? I wanted to know His character, His personality, and who He truly is. To answer this question, we had to peel back the many layers of religious garbage that has been passed onto him through generations. That He is angry. Vengeful. Wrathful. And in general, that He doesn't like you very much. The truth, as you will see vibrantly in this film, is that He is the most loving, compassionate, and wonderful Father you can imagine.""About Wanderlust ProductionsWanderlust Productions is a video production company focusing on creating content for various media that highlights, informs, and is designed to spiritually stretch our audience.

Wanderlust prides itself on its willingness to put the story above the message.  That being said, the message will never waver.My ReviewThis is such an powerful documentary of just how wondrous the love of God is to those that we encounter in our day to day lives. While this video shows some of the extreme conversions of God's power in their lives, from a witch doctor, a notorious Chicago gang leader, a Hindu holy man who has been searching all his life for the one true God, and even a random encounter with people in the land of Israel shows what is impossible for man to achieve, for God it's possible!My husband and I were powerfully impacted in unexpected ways and I have to say my favorite person was an ex-drug addict, now turned street evangelist for God, Todd White. You can just see the love he has for the people he encounters and shows us all that the Bible is alive and real. That they are not just stories but real power that even now we can show to every single person around us and let the light of our Father shine in all of us. Without light, there is only darkness. I received this DVD, Father of Lights compliments of Flyby Promotions and Wanderlust Productions for my honest review and proudly give it a 5 out of 5 shining stars! You can not watch this movie without being impacted for a greater good to share the love and light of God to every single person you meet. This would make for a powerful movie to share in a Bible Study or church group! This DVD runs about 98 minutes and contains some subject matter that might not be suitable for young children.",5,Prepare to see the impossible.

It tells of how different believers listen to God's voice and how they tell others of the Lord.I was quite taken with the first man they showed on the DVD who became a Christian and says he hears God's voice every morning telling him where to go and what to do. This man talks to witch doctors, hindu holy men, gang members etc.. I really believe he has the spirit of the Lord.Also we meet another man who loves the Lord and heals people with laying his hands on people and praying. This part of the movie for me wasn't all that believable, because you never see how bad the person was before he was healed. You just see the person walking and talking after healing. I guess I like to see the person before and after.This group of believers want you to only love others and show them love, not tell them about their sin. I know we do need to show love more and be more compassionate, but we also need to warn them of their sin and help them see themselves.I recommend watching this DVD, but watch with a discerning spirit.""Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in hope that I would mention it on my blog.
