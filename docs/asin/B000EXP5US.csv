Surprised me completely.The characters are portryed so believbly....  no, really.  Even with the dubbing into English, (by the way - very well done) these youths do a surpurb job of 'being' the usual Alpine citizens.European Mountain country...  Switzerland - Austria - Poland - Northern France - who knows?  Who cares?  regarding the dress one would assume either Austria or Switzerland.Children from the village/town school in the valley at the bottom of mountains.  Up on the mountain they live....  Waaaaayyyyy  up there.Main girl character about eleven or twelve with her sibling (I don't remember if it was a little brother or sister) go back home from school one afternoon.  The sibling has a pet kitten.Enter boy schoolmate, a peer or maybe next grade or so up.  This is the main boy character.  Our main girl character is aloof to this young fellow so to show off, he teases the sibling by taking the kitten and holding it over the mountain's edge.  Unnnnnnfortunatly the sibling rushes to rescue his kitten but right over the edge and gone.""Uh Oh....  What've I done?""  Terrified at his own sin and really overcome by guilt and realization that he has caused a reallllllllly baaaaaad thing, the boy runs away and hides in the barn.  This kid is only about twelve or thirteen.  He is discovered by family and with a little coaxing he tearfully confesses that he has killed the sibling.  A little more demand of explanation to get the particulars and the Papa, a youngish middle aged healthy alpine arian grabs a coil of rope and goes to the rescue.Actually the sibling has landed on a ledge but is hurt - badly.  Even after doctoring, this child will have parts in a cast and will be a long time recovering.Our girl character's daily activities round out the rest of the story.The boy protagonist is not only remorseful but now he has the whole village/town's angst to deal with.  Of course he seeks solitude on the mountainside.  At least in solitude there will be no one around to condem any more than he as already done himself....  Taking out a pocket kinife he whittles out some figurine.Enter the/an old man of the mountain who is an artist of woodcarving.  The old man neither approves nor condems the pitiful boy but offers to simply instruct the lad  in his carving talents.Our broken (in spirit and in heart) boy now has a distraction.  He also has a totally objective instructor.How can he make up for his sin?How can he even let it be known how very sorry he is?How can he make amends?What can he do?How can he seek forgivness?Will he ever be able to even like himself again?THAT becomes the Treasure in the Snow.Beliveable (sp?) characters portray a very plausable tale.If you have youts,  don't pass up the chance to entertain them with this gem.  Even if you don't have youts, this is a well done story.Noah  8-?",3,Little known Gem - Sleeper,1261094400,"12 18, 2009",2009,2918,"['been', 'YEARS', 'saw', 'movie', 'vhs', 'captured', 'tv', 'broadcast', 'Surprised', 'completely.The', 'characters', 'are', 'portryed', 'so', 'believbly', 'really', 'Even', 'dubbing', 'English', 'way', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'youths', 'do', 'surpurb', 'job', ""'being"", 'usual', 'Alpine', 'citizens.European', 'Mountain', 'country', 'Switzerland', 'Austria', 'Poland', 'Northern', 'France', 'who', 'Who', 'regarding', 'dress', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'Austria', 'Switzerland.Children', 'village/town', 'school', 'valley', 'bottom', 'mountains', 'mountain', 'live', 'Waaaaayyyyy', 'up', 'there.Main', 'girl', 'character', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'sibling', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'little', 'brother', 'sister', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'school', 'one', 'afternoon', 'sibling', 'pet', 'kitten.Enter', 'boy', 'schoolmate', 'peer', 'maybe', 'next', 'grade', 'so', 'up', 'main', 'boy', 'character', 'main', 'girl', 'character', 'aloof', 'young', 'fellow', 'so', 'show', 'off', 'sibling', 'taking', 'kitten', 'holding', 'mountain', 'edge', 'Unnnnnnfortunatly', 'sibling', 'rushes', 'rescue', 'kitten', 'right', 'edge', 'gone', 'Uh', 'Oh', 'What', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Terrified', 'own', 'sin', 'really', 'overcome', 'guilt', 'realization', 'caused', 'reallllllllly', 'baaaaaad', 'thing', 'boy', 'away', 'hides', 'barn', 'kid', 'only', 'about', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'discovered', 'family', 'little', 'coaxing', 'tearfully', 'killed', 'sibling', 'little', 'more', 'demand', 'explanation', 'get', 'particulars', 'Papa', 'youngish', 'middle', 'aged', 'healthy', 'alpine', 'arian', 'grabs', 'coil', 'rope', 'rescue.Actually', 'sibling', 'landed', 'ledge', 'hurt', 'badly', 'Even', 'doctoring', 'child', 'will', 'have', 'parts', 'cast', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'time', 'recovering.Our', 'girl', 'character', 'daily', 'activities', 'round', 'out', 'rest', 'story.The', 'boy', 'protagonist', 'not', 'only', 'remorseful', 'now', 'whole', 'village/town', 'angst', 'deal', 'course', 'solitude', 'mountainside', 'least', 'solitude', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'around', 'condem', 'more', 'already', 'done', 'Taking', 'out', 'pocket', 'kinife', 'out', 'figurine.Enter', 'the/an', 'old', 'man', 'mountain', 'who', 'artist', 'woodcarving', 'old', 'man', 'approves', 'pitiful', 'boy', 'simply', 'instruct', 'lad', 'carving', 'talents.Our', 'broken', 'spirit', 'heart', 'boy', 'now', 'distraction', 'also', 'totally', 'objective', 'instructor.How', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'sin', 'How', 'can', 'even', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'how', 'very', 'sorry', 'How', 'can', 'make', 'amends', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'How', 'can', 'seek', 'forgivness', 'Will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'even', 'like', 'again', 'Treasure', 'Snow.Beliveable', 'sp', 'characters', 'portray', 'very', 'plausable', 'tale.If', 'have', 'youts', 'do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'chance', 'entertain', 'gem', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'youts', 'well', 'done', 'story.Noah', '8-']",N/A
980437,A3TYF16HATHDHK,B000EXP5US,Timothy,"[8, 8]","This dvd is hard to find, yet it is a gem. Set in a Switzerland village, with lovely chlets, snow capped mountains, and jaggedravines; this back drop is ripe for love, forgiveness, and struggling inside an alpine hamlet=(small country village). It isinteresting how the story here starts and ends alike.Lucien, a ladd of 13 or so, likes to tease his neighbours Annette and Danny, like any other boy would. Annette gave him a bitof a smack. He threw a rock at her. Soon, he teased little Danny, and such a tragic accident occurred that Lucien could notforgive himself for, it seemed.So he befriends an old wood-carver, in a chlet up the mountain side, whom also has his own set of haunts. This pair actuallyhelp each other more than they realise. Lucien learns the wood-carver's secrets with his help. The old gentleman learns ratherquickly Lucien's heartrending story - which made him want to help the ladd.The closeness of the hamlet folks is relevant in his case, and he tries his hardest to gain forgiveness and love through hisworks. This failing to reach Annette and the other children, makes him depressed and tries to work harder. Annette's nicegrandmother, notices a change about her, and tries her best to encourage her to do what she knows is best. Yet she wants toget back at Lucien, to punish him; in doing this, she ends up hurting herself, her brother, dad and grandmother, and leavesout the Lord too.Through a nice set of twists and turns, love, and forgiveness lay over the ""pass"" in the mountains. Interesting turn of eventssets Annette in a different tone, as well as the old gentleman too. The power of the Lord to forgive mankind, and the power offorgiveness towards each other: bringing reconciliation, peace, and harmony. This is a very nice message of forgiveness andloving kindness. This is one great film for the family! If you like the book by Patricia St. John, then you will probably likethis family-friendly program. We highly recommend it.",5,"Hard to find, overlooked jewel.",1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,1969,"['dvd', 'hard', 'find', 'gem', 'Set', 'Switzerland', 'village', 'lovely', 'chlets', 'snow', 'capped', 'mountains', 'jaggedravines', 'back', 'drop', 'ripe', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'struggling', 'alpine', 'hamlet=', 'small', 'country', 'village', 'isinteresting', 'how', 'story', 'here', 'alike.Lucien', 'ladd', '13', 'so', 'likes', 'tease', 'neighbours', 'Annette', 'Danny', 'other', 'boy', 'would', 'Annette', 'gave', 'bitof', 'smack', 'threw', 'rock', 'Soon', 'teased', 'little', 'Danny', 'tragic', 'accident', 'occurred', 'Lucien', 'could', 'notforgive', 'seemed.So', 'old', 'wood-carver', 'chlet', 'up', 'mountain', 'side', 'whom', 'also', 'own', 'set', 'haunts', 'pair', 'other', 'more', 'realise', 'Lucien', 'wood-carver', 'secrets', 'help', 'old', 'gentleman', 'ratherquickly', 'Lucien', 'heartrending', 'story', 'made', 'want', 'help', 'ladd.The', 'closeness', 'hamlet', 'folks', 'relevant', 'case', 'hardest', 'gain', 'forgiveness', 'love', 'hisworks', 'failing', 'reach', 'Annette', 'other', 'children', 'depressed', 'tries', 'work', 'harder', 'Annette', 'nicegrandmother', 'change', 'best', 'encourage', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'toget', 'back', 'Lucien', 'punish', 'doing', 'up', 'hurting', 'brother', 'dad', 'grandmother', 'Lord', 'nice', 'set', 'twists', 'turns', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'lay', 'pass', 'mountains', 'Interesting', 'turn', 'eventssets', 'Annette', 'different', 'tone', 'as', 'well', 'old', 'gentleman', 'too', 'power', 'Lord', 'forgive', 'mankind', 'power', 'offorgiveness', 'towards', 'other', 'bringing', 'reconciliation', 'peace', 'harmony', 'very', 'nice', 'message', 'forgiveness', 'andloving', 'kindness', 'one', 'great', 'film', 'family', 'like', 'book', 'Patricia', 'St.', 'John', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'likethis', 'family-friendly', 'program', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
