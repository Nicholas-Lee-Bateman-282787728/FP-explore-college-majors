1064612,A34PAZQ73SL163,B000OIOPPO,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[3, 7]","This is a first class documentary about someone who could have been a first class President. Richard Nixon was as complex a man as any who ever occupied the Oval Office. His legacy has been tarnished by the bizarre and occasionally sinister deeds he authorized his plumbers and dirty tricks men to commit against his enemies. These enemies were very real but also very much a product of his initial machinations.Those of us on the right are often confused by how much the left hates Nixon because we see him as the big spending, government bloating neo-leftist he actually was. With conservatives around like Nixon in charge of domestic spending there would not be any private sector remaining after awhile. The fact is that this man really did not have a political ideology outside the realm of foreign policy. In that department, with the aid of Kissinger, he accomplished great things. Yes, great things in both his dealings with China and the Soviet Union.Was he brilliant? I think he was but no amount of mental wattage can outshine a disturbed psyche. The man hated and was hated in return. The vanity and narcissism of those ridiculous tapes is what destroyed him but destruction is a fitting and just end for someone who is narcissistic and vain. He was an incredibly insecure man who allowed those who served him to go to jail on his behalf. History remembers him now mostly as a disgrace which is how he deserves to be remembered.",5,Implosion!,1186012800,"08 2, 2007",2007,1440,"['first', 'class', 'documentary', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'class', 'President', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'was', 'complex', 'man', 'who', 'ever', 'occupied', 'Oval', 'Office', 'legacy', 'been', 'tarnished', 'bizarre', 'occasionally', 'sinister', 'deeds', 'authorized', 'plumbers', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'men', 'commit', 'enemies', 'enemies', 'were', 'very', 'real', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'product', 'initial', 'machinations.Those', 'right', 'are', 'often', 'confused', 'how', 'much', 'left', 'Nixon', 'see', 'big', 'spending', 'government', 'bloating', 'neo-leftist', 'actually', 'was', 'conservatives', 'Nixon', 'charge', 'domestic', 'spending', 'there', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'private', 'sector', 'remaining', 'awhile', 'fact', 'man', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'political', 'ideology', 'realm', 'foreign', 'policy', 'department', 'aid', 'Kissinger', 'accomplished', 'great', 'things', 'Yes', 'great', 'things', 'dealings', 'China', 'Soviet', 'Union.Was', 'brilliant', 'think', 'was', 'amount', 'mental', 'wattage', 'can', 'outshine', 'disturbed', 'psyche', 'man', 'hated', 'was', 'hated', 'return', 'vanity', 'narcissism', 'ridiculous', 'tapes', 'what', 'destroyed', 'destruction', 'fitting', 'just', 'end', 'someone', 'who', 'narcissistic', 'vain', 'was', 'incredibly', 'insecure', 'man', 'who', 'allowed', 'who', 'served', 'go', 'jail', 'behalf', 'History', 'now', 'mostly', 'disgrace', 'how', 'be', 'remembered']",Nixon - A Presidency Revealed

1064614,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B000OIOPPO,CGScammell,"[3, 3]","Initially I was disappointed that this production focused mostly on Nixon's dark, ""paranoid"" (as some who knew him described him) side.  But the longer I watched this I came away with a better understanding not so much of the man, but of his administration and how wrapped up in Vietnam and later with Watergate he got.  The audio tapes are quite revealing of Nixon's abuse of power.The downside to this production is that it doesn't go into his pre-political life.  For that I suggest one watches the PBS Presidential version of Nixon, a good production that balances this one out.  This work starts with Nixon's term under Eisenhower and how he rose to power in the 1950s.Nixon's daughter is interviewed for this, Alex Butterfield, Sen Bob Dole, Henry Kissinger and a few others, but not VP Ford or others closely working with Nixon.  That is fine, though as the tapes we get to listen to in part say enough of Nixon the man.Sen Dole said it best that Nixon the persona overshadowed some of the laws that Nixon passed early in his administration:  environmental laws and other seemingly-progressive laws that were later overlooked when Watergare came around.  He would be considered a moderate-progressive to today's standard Republican and, according to Dole, never be nominated to the GOP.  It makes one think of what could have happened had Nixon won the election in 1960 instead of Kennedy.This is a nice addition to a presidential buff's personal library.",4,The dark side of Nixon,1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,1462,"['Initially', 'was', 'disappointed', 'production', 'focused', 'mostly', 'Nixon', 'dark', 'paranoid', 'who', 'knew', 'described', 'side', 'longer', 'watched', 'came', 'away', 'better', 'understanding', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'man', 'administration', 'how', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Vietnam', 'later', 'Watergate', 'got', 'audio', 'tapes', 'are', 'quite', 'revealing', 'Nixon', 'abuse', 'power.The', 'downside', 'production', ""n't"", 'go', 'pre-political', 'life', 'suggest', 'one', 'PBS', 'Presidential', 'version', 'Nixon', 'good', 'production', 'one', 'out', 'work', 'Nixon', 'term', 'Eisenhower', 'how', 'rose', 'power', '1950s.Nixon', 'daughter', 'interviewed', 'Alex', 'Butterfield', 'Sen', 'Bob', 'Dole', 'Henry', 'Kissinger', 'few', 'others', 'not', 'VP', 'Ford', 'others', 'closely', 'working', 'Nixon', 'fine', 'though', 'tapes', 'get', 'listen', 'part', 'say', 'enough', 'Nixon', 'man.Sen', 'Dole', 'said', 'best', 'Nixon', 'persona', 'overshadowed', 'laws', 'Nixon', 'passed', 'early', 'administration', 'environmental', 'laws', 'other', 'seemingly-progressive', 'laws', 'were', 'later', 'overlooked', 'when', 'Watergare', 'came', 'around', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'moderate-progressive', 'today', 'standard', 'Republican', 'according', 'Dole', 'never', 'be', 'nominated', 'GOP', 'one', 'think', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'Nixon', 'won', 'election', '1960', 'instead', 'Kennedy.This', 'nice', 'addition', 'presidential', 'buff', 'personal', 'library']",Nixon - A Presidency Revealed

I wouldn't actually recommend it, because it doesn't feature enough detail about Nixon or his life to warrant repeated viewings throughout the course of a 365 day year.  A more thorough DVD is necessary to do this.  The extras here are the same; awesome to watch a few times, boring and rote thereafter.  Works well as a PBS special that airs once a year, where the viewer cannot memorize every single line being uttered by every participant.  One thing: no interviews with either the late John Mitchell, the late Pat Nixon, the late Gerald Ford, or even the late Richard Nixon himself.  DVD needed that actually encompasses the man's life.",4,"Good DVD, but after about 5 viewings you memorize all of the material.",1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,751,"['Good', 'DVD', 'Material', 'easily', 'recalled', 'few', 'viewings', 'no', 'longer', 'intriguing', 'new', 'would', ""n't"", 'actually', 'recommend', ""n't"", 'feature', 'enough', 'detail', 'Nixon', 'life', 'warrant', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'course', '365', 'day', 'year', 'more', 'thorough', 'DVD', 'necessary', 'do', 'extras', 'here', 'are', 'same', 'awesome', 'watch', 'few', 'times', 'boring', 'rote', 'thereafter', 'Works', 'well', 'PBS', 'special', 'once', 'year', 'where', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'memorize', 'single', 'line', 'being', 'uttered', 'participant', 'One', 'thing', 'interviews', 'late', 'John', 'Mitchell', 'late', 'Pat', 'Nixon', 'late', 'Gerald', 'Ford', 'even', 'late', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'DVD', 'needed', 'actually', 'man', 'life']",Nixon - A Presidency Revealed
