I watched the first disk once and thought ... ""Ehh. It's no Monty Python."" Then I watched the extras, saw the rest of the episodes, and by the end I was totally hooked.David Walliams and (especially) Matt Lucas aren't just inspired comedians, they're brilliant actors. Even when the skits don't come off, once you've made a connection with them, it's funny just watching them breathe. In some ways the humor reminds me of old radio shows, where characters have recurring taglines and zany verbal tics that get stuck in your head over time until you're practically quoting them in your sleep (it's no surprise to learn that ""Little Britain"" started as a radio show). There's also a lot of care taken with wigs, makeup, costumes and interiors, which adds to the social edge of the humor and shows the kind of attention Lucas and Walliams pay to the British types they're skewering (it's impressive to see the skits evolve as you watch the deleted scenes).What their huge cast of surreal characters have in common is the ability to live completely inside their own fantasies about themselves. The humor is mostly in watching reality try to intrude on their delusions, and fail. Hard to believe it's only two guys creating this ridiculous, over the top, complete-unto-itself universe.

It had me in stitches. And it has had me in stitches ever since.The sketches and the characters are original (well, they're basically just blokes dressing up as girls and such, but in a new way:-) and they take it straight to the limit, as for example with the young chap who fancies older women (the finale of that particular series of sketches is at the same time some of the most hilarious and revolting I've ever seen). Who can keep a straight face when you see (and more importantly hear) Matt Lucas in the shape of Vicki Pollard ramble on about nothing and anything and nothing again? Or Andy making Lou's days a ""straight keffufle""? Even the narration of the series is enough to get me laughing out loud. Tom Baker does an absolutely fantastic job of narrating utter nonsense.I've heard people mention the monotony of the sketches. Seen one you've seen 'em all. That is true. David Walliams in fact commented on that very thing in an interview once: you know exactly what's gonna happen. However, these are characters and indeed sketches, that dosen't wear easily. I've seen them all many times, and I still laugh every time. They are simply funny, no matter how many times you see them (well, within reason of course).This is some of the best comedy to hit the tube for a long, long time.

The series was totally different; definitely for a more mature audience, crude, vulgar, suggestive, ridiculous, silly, but extremely entertaining and funny. It was the type of series that I enjoyed watching alone but would have been somewhat uncomfortable watching in the prescence of someone else. Since the skits presented are so obviously ridiculous, I was able to laugh openly. There wasn't the slightest bit of seriousness or sincerity in the entire series. I particularly enjoyed watching them to see what type of humor the UK was enjoying. Many of the skits contained &#34;insider&#34; type humor with references to people and movie/TV productions that I wasn't familiar with, but this had a very minor impact on the overall production and did not distract in any fashion. I have always been offended by humor at the expense of others (individuals or groups) but the manner in which this series was presented set aside any reservations on my part at being offended by the silly skits. They were designed only with the thought of laughter and not to make any social statement or have any redeeming value. I am now on the hunt for similiar presentations from the UK with similiar humor so am open to any recommendations.

905015,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B0009FVS8Y,Caleb Williams,"[7, 21]","When Little Britain first hit our screens in 2003 it certainly made an impact as an over the top, hilarious reflection of the British public. David Walliams and Matt Lucas were virtually unknown at the time of its debut, I only really recognised Lucas from his time on Shooting Stars. There's no denying that these men have a knack for comic timing and are great comic minds in their own individual ways. However, what they did was find their hook and keep hold of it for as long as humanly possible. The characters such as Vicky Pollard, Lou & Andy and Marjorie Dawes, were used on such a repetitive level that it's now made what I once held as an enjoyable sketch show into something I loath.The premise of this sketch show is to jump into the everyday lives of British people and sketch after sketch sees characters in truly bizarre situations. The characters unique and bizarre traits are what really made this show enjoyable at the beginning of its tenure on our screens. Vicky Pollard is by far the most recognised character as upon its original debut it was widely discussed as to how this mimics the teenagers of today, much like Katherine Tate's teenage character, Lauren. Vicky's catchphrase of ""Yeah, but No"" really caught on and rather than mocking teenagers, it gave teenagers another way to annoy the public.Lou & Andy are the more interesting pare of characters and are about the only sketch that I still enjoy to this day. Lou is a carer for the supposed wheelchair bound, Andy. Andy isn't actually as incapable as he first appears as the minute Lou's back is turned we see Andy jump out of the chair and get into all kinds of trouble. I don't want to over analyse things but it sort of says a lot about the members of the public who claim such things as disability benefit. Now there's no denying that some members of the British public do need to claim it, but this character makes fun of those who tend to rush into claiming such benefits when they clearly do not need it. Andy's catchphrase of ""I Don't Like It"" is also something that has been adopted by many and become quite annoying, but the real gem of it is when Lou quotes Andy in an attempt to persuade him not to do something he wont like. Lou will quote the most intelligent sentences which apparently came from Andy at one point, but we never get to see that and it's personally something I quite enjoy.The Little Britain franchise started flogging a dead horse when they decided to produce a third series, which much the same characters and catchphrases as the previous two series. I was lucky enough to see their live stage show and it was much more inventive than what the television show has become. The American version is equally as tedious as the British show had become at its end. There have been a few specials such as Little Britain Abroad which were good for the fact the characters are in a different setting, but it become boring very quickly indeed.Overall the show started off brilliantly but due to the over saturation of the main characters it became boring very quickly. Walliams and Lucas are two very talented comedy minds, but they let the hype get ahead of them and because of how the public caught onto some characters they decided to milk it rather than trying to remain consistently original in the sketches the two produced.",3,"Started Well, But Died Quickly",1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,3331,"['When', 'Little', 'Britain', 'first', 'hit', 'screens', '2003', 'certainly', 'made', 'impact', 'top', 'hilarious', 'reflection', 'British', 'public', 'David', 'Walliams', 'Matt', 'Lucas', 'were', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'time', 'debut', 'only', 'really', 'recognised', 'Lucas', 'time', 'Shooting', 'Stars', 'denying', 'men', 'have', 'knack', 'comic', 'timing', 'are', 'great', 'comic', 'minds', 'own', 'individual', 'ways', 'However', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'find', 'hook', 'keep', 'hold', 'as', 'long', 'humanly', 'possible', 'characters', 'such', 'Vicky', 'Pollard', 'Lou', 'Andy', 'Marjorie', 'Dawes', 'were', 'used', 'repetitive', 'level', 'now', 'made', 'what', 'once', 'held', 'enjoyable', 'sketch', 'show', 'something', 'loath.The', 'premise', 'sketch', 'show', 'jump', 'everyday', 'lives', 'British', 'people', 'sketch', 'sketch', 'characters', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'situations', 'characters', 'unique', 'bizarre', 'traits', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'made', 'show', 'enjoyable', 'beginning', 'tenure', 'screens', 'Vicky', 'Pollard', 'far', 'most', 'recognised', 'character', 'original', 'debut', 'was', 'widely', 'discussed', 'how', 'teenagers', 'today', 'much', 'Katherine', 'Tate', 'teenage', 'character', 'Lauren', 'Vicky', 'catchphrase', 'Yeah', 'No', 'really', 'caught', 'rather', 'mocking', 'teenagers', 'gave', 'teenagers', 'way', 'annoy', 'public.Lou', 'Andy', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'pare', 'characters', 'are', 'only', 'sketch', 'still', 'enjoy', 'day', 'Lou', 'carer', 'supposed', 'wheelchair', 'bound', 'Andy', 'Andy', ""n't"", 'actually', 'as', 'incapable', 'first', 'minute', 'Lou', 'back', 'turned', 'see', 'Andy', 'jump', 'chair', 'get', 'kinds', 'trouble', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'analyse', 'things', 'sort', 'lot', 'members', 'public', 'who', 'claim', 'such', 'things', 'disability', 'benefit', 'Now', 'denying', 'members', 'British', 'public', 'do', 'need', 'claim', 'character', 'fun', 'who', 'tend', 'rush', 'claiming', 'such', 'benefits', 'when', 'clearly', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'Andy', 'catchphrase', 'Do', ""n't"", 'also', 'something', 'been', 'adopted', 'many', 'become', 'quite', 'annoying', 'real', 'gem', 'when', 'Lou', 'Andy', 'attempt', 'persuade', 'not', 'do', 'something', 'Lou', 'will', 'quote', 'most', 'intelligent', 'sentences', 'apparently', 'came', 'Andy', 'one', 'point', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'personally', 'something', 'quite', 'enjoy.The', 'Little', 'Britain', 'franchise', 'started', 'flogging', 'dead', 'horse', 'when', 'decided', 'produce', 'third', 'series', 'much', 'same', 'characters', 'catchphrases', 'previous', 'two', 'series', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'live', 'stage', 'show', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'inventive', 'what', 'television', 'show', 'become', 'American', 'version', 'equally', 'as', 'tedious', 'British', 'show', 'had', 'become', 'end', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'specials', 'such', 'Little', 'Britain', 'Abroad', 'were', 'good', 'fact', 'characters', 'are', 'different', 'setting', 'become', 'boring', 'very', 'quickly', 'indeed.Overall', 'show', 'started', 'off', 'brilliantly', 'due', 'over', 'saturation', 'main', 'characters', 'became', 'boring', 'very', 'quickly', 'Walliams', 'Lucas', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'talented', 'comedy', 'minds', 'let', 'hype', 'get', 'ahead', 'how', 'public', 'caught', 'characters', 'decided', 'milk', 'rather', 'trying', 'remain', 'consistently', 'original', 'sketches', 'two', 'produced']",Little Britain: The Complete First Series

Not sure if its quite up to Python, Young Ones or The League, but despite its repetitiveness I think its way up there. Actually its amazing how many times you can watch the same routine over and over and still be sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for the punch which might involve a man in a realistic looking fat lady body suit complete with naughty bits disrobing, someone getting vomited on or a good old fashioned gay prime minister joke. Then again, this is what I admire about the Brits. They have almost no comic taboos, not God, not the Queen (not midgets, not Chinese people and certainly not braindamaged people in wheelchairs either)... The more sacred it is, the more likely they're to joke about it. There are very few countries in the world where people have the freedom to make jokes about their own monarch, God and whatever else without getting in big trouble, so I think it says a lot for the State of their democracy - - even if they *are* all poofs and going to burn.All in all, for devoted fans of Britcoms and British Humor this is a must have purchase !

905037,A140XH16IKR4B0,B0009FVS8Y,Jean E. Pouliot,"[1, 2]","There is much going for ""Little Britain,"" mostly in the persons of its two leads -- Matt Lucas and David Walliams -- who perform at least a dozen characters between them. The characters themselves are funny and original -- from rapid-talking bad schoolgirl Vicky Pollard, to unconvincing transvestite Emily Howard, to poodle-coddling, bonbon-eating trash novelist Dame Sally Markham. It's amazing how two actors can conjure up and play such divergent characters -- each having unique catch phrases, makeup and mannerisms.But Little Britain has more than its fair share of misses. Des Kaye, the out of work TV kids show host now employed at a hardware store is creepy and wretched, but not funny. The narrator's introductions are so juvenile that I thought they might be parodies. And the characters find themselves in precisely the same situations over and over again. This is particularly true for  the characters Lou Todd and Andy Pipkin. Andy is wheelchair-bound and constantly vexes his longsuffering companion Lou with demands for items that (once he has gotten them) he instantly rejects. This was interesting the first time, and perhaps the second, but by the 6th of 7th repetition of the formula, I was wondering about the writers' seriousness. And sanity. Then, there is the vulgarity, which given the show's deficits, seems an attempt to make up with grossness what it lacks in cleverness.

905039,A3H7ADUP07D93H,B0009FVS8Y,"J. Fuchs ""jax76""","[3, 6]","It pains me to give this DVD anything less than 5 stars since the second and third series are possibly the funniest sketch comedy ever, but in this, the first season, David Williams and Matt Lucas hadn't quite worked things out.  When the sketches hit, they really hit, but there are still quite a few misfires and if you've only seen the third season on BBC America, you may be disappointed by this disk.A number of the characters that are so funny in the later series are here (Vicki Pollard, the teenage delinquent who is the mother of six children by seven different fathers, Lou and Andy, Marjorie Dawes of Fight Fighters, Daffyd, the self-professed only gay in his Welsh mining village, Emily Howard, the really bad transsexual, the Prime Minister and his flaming aide, Sebastian, and my personal favorite, Anne, the not-so-mental mental patient who only says ""eh-eh-eh"" while doing hilariously inappropriate things in front of her oblivious, doting doctor.)  Unfortunately, there are also a number of characters who, for reasons that are obvious after the viewing the disk, did not make it past this first series, and some of the great characters from series 2 and 3 (such as former gymnast, Bubbles Devere) hadn't yet been introduced.It's also worth mentioning that although the humor is definitely tongue-in-cheek, there is a great deal of fun-making at the expense of fat people and although, as one reviewer stated, it's a case of misdirected self-loathing, the barbs can be rather cruel at times and sensitive types might find the humor offensive.If you like the later episodes of Little Britain you'll probably enjoy this season, but if you're new to the series and just want to check out what all the fuss is all about, start with series 2.  Because the answer to the question of whether this disk is the best British comedy out there is sadly, ""computer says 'no.'""",3,Hilarious sketch comedy with some bugs to work out,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,1880,"['give', 'DVD', 'anything', 'less', '5', 'stars', 'second', 'third', 'series', 'are', 'possibly', 'funniest', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'ever', 'first', 'season', 'David', 'Williams', 'Matt', 'Lucas', 'had', ""n't"", 'quite', 'worked', 'things', 'out', 'When', 'sketches', 'hit', 'really', 'hit', 'are', 'still', 'quite', 'few', 'misfires', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'third', 'season', 'BBC', 'America', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'disk.A', 'number', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'later', 'series', 'are', 'here', 'Vicki', 'Pollard', 'teenage', 'delinquent', 'who', 'mother', 'six', 'children', 'seven', 'different', 'fathers', 'Lou', 'Andy', 'Marjorie', 'Dawes', 'Fight', 'Fighters', 'Daffyd', 'self-professed', 'only', 'gay', 'Welsh', 'mining', 'village', 'Emily', 'Howard', 'really', 'bad', 'transsexual', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'flaming', 'aide', 'Sebastian', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Anne', 'not-so-mental', 'mental', 'patient', 'who', 'only', 'eh-eh-eh', 'doing', 'hilariously', 'inappropriate', 'things', 'front', 'oblivious', 'doting', 'doctor', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'also', 'number', 'characters', 'who', 'reasons', 'are', 'obvious', 'viewing', 'disk', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'first', 'series', 'great', 'characters', 'series', '2', '3', 'such', 'former', 'gymnast', 'Bubbles', 'Devere', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'been', 'introduced.It', 'also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'humor', 'definitely', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'great', 'deal', 'fun-making', 'expense', 'fat', 'people', 'one', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'case', 'misdirected', 'self-loathing', 'barbs', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'cruel', 'times', 'sensitive', 'types', 'might', 'find', 'humor', 'like', 'later', 'episodes', 'Little', 'Britain', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'season', ""'re"", 'new', 'series', 'just', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'what', 'fuss', 'start', 'series', '2', 'answer', 'question', 'disk', 'best', 'British', 'comedy', 'sadly', 'computer']",Little Britain: The Complete First Series

The formula is very much the same per each episode, but it's almost as though we're following the very colourful characters in the show through episodes in their lives, and even though you know what's coming, it's always great to see how they manage to incorporate the catch phrases or idiosyncracies of these wonderfully nutty people into new situations.  The characters are memorable and even quotable: ""I'm a LADY, you see..."" or ""If you ask me on a Monday, I'd say ah-Yeeeesss!""  This series is sketch comedy, and it's just plain funny.  It doesn't involve having to think about the humour, and it's occasionally gross without being too over-the-top.

905045,A27493GW3TEX65,B0009FVS8Y,L. Wilde,"[97, 103]","After two highly successful seasons and a DVD release in Britain, BBC is finally giving us Americans the home version of the `less refined' nature of the British population. Not all ""tea and crumpets"" this or ""jolly good"" that, this comedy sketch series brings us two actors who morph into a myriad of more than one hundred and twenty different characters -- all who would give the Queen heart palpitations and are guaranteed to bring laughter to your living room. Although still foreign to most Americans these characters and their infectious catch phrases are already imbedded in the British lexicon. The whole show relies heavily on these character catch phrases and scenes full of running jokes repeating and trumping themselves in different contexts -- much similar to how real British `characters' act in real life just personified and embellished here by the amazingly diverse Matt Lucas and David Willams. Just reading the lines, situations, descriptions, and catch phrases won't do much for you. It's Matt and David's ability to bring these characters to life that will leave you laughing and repeating the lines with your friends. Walk into a pub, or grammar school, or store in Britain and you'll certainly hear many of them repeated. Share this series with your friends and you'll have a whole new vocabulary to share. A selection of characters follows:""I want that one.""Not-so-wheelchair-bound Andy, and his long-suffering, volunteer caregiver Lou are the favorite characters of many. Although the formula for their running gag is always predictable, that's the point. Will Andy ever learn Lou knows what he wants better than he does himself? Will Lou ever stop enabling Andy' s strange whims? Will Lou ever discover Andy doesn't need the wheelchair Lou's been pushing all these years? Probably not, and that running gag is the recipe for their relationship and humor. The boys up the ante early on in the running gag department when Lou memorably takes Andy to the public pool.""Yeahbutnobutyeahbutnobut, Shut up!""Juvenile delinquent Vicky Pollard whose fast talking and nearly incomprehensible speech patter will have you grabbing for the remote to enable to subtitles option. Unlike Brits who watched this show on BBC, you'll actually be able to find out what she's rambling about. She'd swap her baby for a ""boy band"" CD and stabs out a cigarette in each episode. Part of the humor is the adults around her still trying to treat her babbling as normal communication and obviously missing some of the outrageous things that come out of her mouth -- things you'll just be able to catch. She's every parent's worst nightmare and is one character you definitely have to experience for yourself.""I am the only gay in the village.""Dafydd is convinced, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that he is the only gay in his small mining village of Llanddewi Brefi. The most funny part of these sketches aren't the sight gags of Dafydd's rotund body sausaged into the next rubber/mesh/pleather outfit (each one more outrageous than the last) and the village people's indifference to his appearance in them, though you'll definitely laugh out loud at their sight. It's the small mining townspeople's comfort level at saying the most colored, cheeky, and outrageous things to Dafydd while conversing with him. Although everyone in the village tries to identify other gays for Dafydd to socialize with, Dafydd's self-identity is based around being ""the only gay in the village"" and keeps him isolated from some really good fun.""The Prime Minister is Gorgeous!""Government Aide Sebastian who is hopelessly in love with his boss the Prime Minister of Great Britain (expertly played by Anthony Head) gets it's humor from the audience trying to decide if the PM is aware of Sebastian's obvious crush and trying to decipher his dead pan looks. Each time Sebastian goes further over the line, you're convinced a sacking is next on the agenda.""Eh, eh, ehhh.""Anne the perhaps-not-so-mental patient in the Stephen Speilburg Hospital is under the watchful care of Dr. Morris. While `innocently' destroying everything around him/her, can only utter the phrase eh, eh, ehhh  . . . unless talking on the cellphone with friends.""Mayyyyybe yes, mayyyybe no.""The looney Innkeeper of the Ye Olde Hotel in Scotland and his magic flute. He can never give you a straight answer to your questions but will punctuate his responses with a few puffs on his flute. The humor lies in the fact that everyone in Scotland acts like this, right?""Dust is low in fat so you can eat as much dust as you like.""Marjorie Dawes is the less than slender leader of the local chapter of Fat Fighters. In what can only be described as misdirected self-loathing she viciously belittles the members of her weight loss group who still keep coming back week after week. How this woman keeps her job is unknown. The acid interaction she has with the ever returning members of the group, especially Mira and Paul, provides the most humor.Other reoccurring characters don't have catch phrases but still have their running gags nonetheless. Just a selection of these follow:The schoolteacher at Kelsey Grammar school who confuses his students more than teaching them . . . Royal correspondent Peter Andr' who is in love with Princess Anne and also not right in the head . . . a quick peek behind the writing process will have you wondering how Dame Sally Markham ever became a famous novelist . . . Hypnotist Kenny Craig who is not afraid to use his talents to get whatever he wants. Just be careful not to look into his eyes . . .the former actor Sir Bernard Chumley who eats his invalid sister Kitty's Meals on Wheels. ""I didn't push her,"" he claims even when not asked . . . Edward Grant is the schoolteacher who married one of his former pupils Samantha and still treats her as such. . . Dennis Waterman the pint sized actor who insists on writing and performing his own awful sounding theme tunes. The humor here is in the running ""scale of objects"" gag . . . Denver Mills the Olympic medalist who should really forget his new career in speech giving and stick to running . . . Des Kaye the ex-children's television star who's not adjusting well to loosing his show and taking a job at the ""Do It Yourself"" shop.Other characters include Emily Howard the unconvincing transvestite who ""is a lady and likes ladies things"" still utters one of the most memorable and more quotable (though sadly not printable here) lines in the show when he's told before an getting an x-ray he must cover his `meat and two vedge' with a lead shield. ""But I'm a lady,"" he protests, ""I don't have (insert feminized version of `two vegetables' here). Jason, the bloke who fancies his friend' Gary's grandmother in the worst way is soooo wrong, very wrong, but you're compelled to watch anyway. Most of these skits veer deeply into the PG-13 category so you'd want to pack the little ones off to bed before breaking it out or you'll have you toddler repeating the most embarrassing phrases.While the intro to each weekly episode is the same visually, it's the different voiceovers narrated by Tom Baker, of Dr. Who fame, that will elicit quite a chuckle. Baker introduces each sketch in a funny voiceover as well and closes each episode after a funny version of the latest, failed world record attempt. Baker's voiceovers are the glue that tie the whole show together and are just as humorous as the skits themselves.For those of you who like Bonus features, you will not be disappointed here. There is a commentary track for each episode on this disk by Matt and David; surprisingly deadpan, you may miss the humor if you're not listening carefully. Also included are the Pilot Episode, Deleted Scenes, a hysterical television interview with Matt and David, a ""Character Playlist"" that will allow you to view an edited version of some of your favorite character's sketches in their running order. One warning when selecting ""Lou & Andy."" You'll have to tell Lou ""Yes"" twice that you want to ""crash the disc"" but NOT three times or your disc will indeed crash (it's not permanent). Try it once if you like and then simply eject the disc and reinsert to go back to the main menu. In the ""Extras"" section on the second disc, you'll get to see what Matt and David were up to prior to this series when you view the ""Best of Rock Profiles"" -- hilarious non-impressions of famous (and some local British) musical artists. ""How to Make a Little Britain"" is the behind-the-scenes feature that chronicles the filming of all eight episodes over the time span of 40 days. The ""Teenage Cancer Trust Sketches"" are fun to watch and the ""Radio 5 Interview"" will give you more inside scoop. ""What Does Britain Mean to You?"" is a collection of man-on-the-street interviews with the characters humorously answering the question while poking fun at themselves in the process.",5,Masters of

Anthony Head (from the Merlin TV series) makes appearances in season one of Little Britain as a politician.

With a range of zaney to bizarre charactors there is sure to be something in this season for everyone.

905055,A2NSPP048P1NRZ,B0009FVS8Y,Mrs. George,"[0, 0]","I came across this series completely out of context, since I'm American and discovered it in a DVD box set long after the series had run its course on BBC TV and Matt Lucas and David Walliams had moved on to other things. I fell deeply in love with it right away. Then I started reading about it on the internet and discovered (a) most Americans have never heard of it, and (b) despite its massive popularity when it was first shown on the BBC a significant number of people in the UK are eager to tell the world how much they despise it and Lucas and Walliams.I can see why some British progressives are ""Little Britain"" haters as much of the humor in this series, especially in the second and third seasons, is shocking and gross and relies on stereotypes that can be interpreted as sociopolitically reactionary--a teenage mom with criminal tendencies, people with fake disabilities scamming their caretakers, flamboyantly gay men annoying everybody around them. Lucas and Walliams were perhaps unwise in insisting on doing the old Peter Sellers ""aren't I funny, I can play anybody"" thing, even appearing as blackface minstrels in the first season. This tendency to push the outside of the envelope of what John Waters called ""good bad taste"" would get them in deeper trouble with their follow-up comedy series ""Come Fly With Me,"" which I do find pretty unbearable. Coming from the land of Rush Limbaugh and ""South Park,"" where great fortunes are built on sadism masquerading as comedy, I honestly don't think Lucas and Walliams' humor is intentionally cruel or demeaning. Let's just say they can be a little callow from time to time.As far as the contents of this box set are concerned, I can't say enough good things about ""Little Britain"" the original three-season series and its companion, ""Little Britain Live,"" a recording of the stage show that Lucas and Walliams toured the UK and Australia with at the height of the show's popularity. They are first-rate comedy and great theater by two very intelligent, original and charming performer-writers. Given the sometimes very edgy material they're acting out onscreen, it's funny how polite and decorous Lucas and Walliams are on the DVD audio commentary (although Walliams, whose naked body is much on display throughout, helpfully points out to the viewer every instance in which his genitalia are visible through his costumes.) The additional materials in this set are mostly very welcome. The pilot episode is fascinating as it shows how the TV series evolved from its origins as a radio series (which is also available in its own well-produced box set that includes video recordings of Lucas and Walliams performing the radio shows--I highly recommend this to fans of the TV series.) There's also a generous portion of ""Little Britain"" sketches performed for TV specials and charity events and a sampler of sketches from ""Rock Profile,"" the Lucas-Walliams TV series that came just before ""Little Britain,"" which I found underwhelming as it's mostly impersonations of British pop stars I've never heard of. I hope the much superior early Lucas and Walliams series ""Mash and Peas"" and ""Sir Bernard's Stately Homes"" get their own box set someday.As for ""Little Britain USA,"" I prefer to pretend it doesn't exist. I can understand Lucas and Walliams' urge to extend their enormously popular UK hit into the American market, but it was doomed precisely because ""Little Britain"" is such a specifically British confection that it just doesn't translate into the American idiom. But then when you have an iconic comedy series like this it can be hard to recreate in another context.",5,Their Little Britain and mine,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,3635,"['came', 'series', 'completely', 'context', ""'m"", 'American', 'discovered', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'long', 'series', 'had', 'run', 'course', 'BBC', 'TV', 'Matt', 'Lucas', 'David', 'Walliams', 'had', 'moved', 'other', 'things', 'fell', 'deeply', 'love', 'right', 'away', 'Then', 'started', 'reading', 'internet', 'discovered', 'most', 'Americans', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'b', 'massive', 'popularity', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'BBC', 'significant', 'number', 'people', 'UK', 'are', 'eager', 'tell', 'world', 'how', 'much', 'despise', 'Lucas', 'Walliams.I', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'British', 'progressives', 'are', 'Little', 'Britain', 'haters', 'much', 'humor', 'series', 'especially', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'shocking', 'gross', 'relies', 'stereotypes', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'sociopolitically', 'reactionary', 'teenage', 'mom', 'criminal', 'tendencies', 'people', 'fake', 'disabilities', 'scamming', 'caretakers', 'flamboyantly', 'gay', 'men', 'annoying', 'everybody', 'Lucas', 'Walliams', 'were', 'perhaps', 'unwise', 'insisting', 'doing', 'old', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'can', 'play', 'anybody', 'thing', 'even', 'appearing', 'blackface', 'minstrels', 'first', 'season', 'tendency', 'push', 'outside', 'envelope', 'what', 'John', 'Waters', 'called', 'good', 'bad', 'taste', 'would', 'get', 'deeper', 'trouble', 'follow-up', 'comedy', 'series', 'Come', 'Fly', 'Me', 'do', 'find', 'pretty', 'unbearable', 'Coming', 'land', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh', 'South', 'Park', 'where', 'great', 'fortunes', 'are', 'built', 'sadism', 'masquerading', 'comedy', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Lucas', 'Walliams', 'humor', 'intentionally', 'cruel', 'demeaning', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'callow', 'time', 'time.As', 'far', 'contents', 'box', 'set', 'are', 'concerned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'Little', 'Britain', 'original', 'three-season', 'series', 'companion', 'Little', 'Britain', 'Live', 'recording', 'stage', 'show', 'Lucas', 'Walliams', 'toured', 'UK', 'Australia', 'height', 'show', 'popularity', 'are', 'first-rate', 'comedy', 'great', 'theater', 'two', 'very', 'intelligent', 'original', 'charming', 'performer-writers', 'Given', 'sometimes', 'very', 'edgy', 'material', ""'re"", 'acting', 'out', 'onscreen', 'funny', 'how', 'polite', 'decorous', 'Lucas', 'Walliams', 'are', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Walliams', 'naked', 'body', 'much', 'display', 'helpfully', 'out', 'viewer', 'instance', 'genitalia', 'are', 'visible', 'costumes', 'additional', 'materials', 'set', 'are', 'mostly', 'very', 'welcome', 'pilot', 'episode', 'fascinating', 'how', 'TV', 'series', 'evolved', 'origins', 'radio', 'series', 'also', 'available', 'own', 'well-produced', 'box', 'set', 'video', 'recordings', 'Lucas', 'Walliams', 'performing', 'radio', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'TV', 'series', 'also', 'generous', 'portion', 'Little', 'Britain', 'sketches', 'performed', 'TV', 'specials', 'charity', 'events', 'sampler', 'sketches', 'Rock', 'Profile', 'Lucas-Walliams', 'TV', 'series', 'came', 'just', 'Little', 'Britain', 'found', 'underwhelming', 'mostly', 'impersonations', 'British', 'pop', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'hope', 'much', 'superior', 'early', 'Lucas', 'Walliams', 'series', 'Mash', 'Peas', 'Sir', 'Bernard', 'Stately', 'Homes', 'get', 'own', 'box', 'set', 'someday.As', 'Little', 'Britain', 'USA', 'prefer', 'pretend', ""n't"", 'exist', 'can', 'understand', 'Lucas', 'Walliams', 'urge', 'extend', 'enormously', 'popular', 'UK', 'hit', 'American', 'market', 'was', 'doomed', 'precisely', 'Little', 'Britain', 'specifically', 'British', 'confection', 'just', ""n't"", 'translate', 'American', 'idiom', 'then', 'when', 'have', 'iconic', 'comedy', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'recreate', 'context']",Little Britain: The Complete First Series

Although they do have female actresses on the show, it's not all them in the dresses or frocks as they are called. They just played the leads. I love Daffyd who believes that he's the only gay in a small Welsh village despite the Star Trek Gay fan club, the lesbian barmaid, and other signs of homosexuality. He would rather be the only gay person in the entire village than admit that he's not the only one. I love the fat fighters support group woman who is mean and critical of her group members at time. I love the prime minister played by Anthony Head and the narrator is played by the great Tom Baker of Doctor Who fame. What about the young guy who falls head over heels in love with his best friend's grandmother or the scene of a Scottish holiday which includes a couple lying out in the rain as if they were on the beach.

905067,A3FDBBQ0NK2SSO,B0009FVS8Y,"takingadayoff ""takingadayoff""","[1, 1]","Little Britain is being compared to The Office and The League of Gentlemen. I have to disagree. After watching the first few episodes of The Office, I gave up - it seemed like the same joke over and over, although it was funny the first time. I haven't watched League of Gentlemen at all, since the preview of it on other BBC videos is not at all funny. Little Britain reminds me more of early French and Saunders.It took me several episodes before I even realized that nearly all the characters were being played by the same two actors, Matt Lucas and David Walliams. Walliams, the tall dark one, is very good, but Lucas is just amazing. Due to a medical condition, he has no hair, so he is completely bald and has a very smooth face, rather like one of those kid's toys in which you use a magnet to decorate the cartoon bald man with metal shavings through clear plastic. With his collection of wigs and eyebrows Lucas becomes each of the characters he plays. But it's Lucas's acting that makes you forget that this thirty-ish man is playing a fourteen year old girl or a forty year old woman.Although many of the characters are very funny the first and even second time around, they get old quickly. The Scottish innkeeper and the institutionalized Ann fall into this category. Even Vicky Pollard and Daffyd, two of the most popular characters, are likely to wear thin from overexposure. On the other hand, several of the characters seem to be deeper and edgier. Marjorie Dawes, the Fat Fighters instructor and Les, the former children's show host, are characters who seem cheerful at first, but it isn't long before someone gets on their bad side, and they turn rather frightening, in different ways. I'd like to see more of them.The DVD set of the first season includes all the episodes, plus the pilot episode, which includes a lot of the same skits that turn up in the first season. There are also several entertaining interviews with the cast and crew of Little Britain, some clips of Lucas and Walliams in a pre-Little Britain program, and a slide show of most of the characters. Enough here to keep you entertained until the next season is released on DVD (soon, I hope!).",5,"""Dust. Anybody? No?

Been there, done it--will Lou ever figure out that Andy can walk?  That'd be something so see.The schoolmaster who marries a former student--boring, overdone, not funny.  Sorry to the girl that has to be the bride in that sketch, but they don't give her enough to do.Now, the other schoolmaster who doesn't have a clue:  fantastic!  I had several of these in public school!  More of him, I do want to see!Vicki:  Oh God, but do I know several of those!  The cigarette puffing, screwball trailer trash girl is a howl!Really, there's a lot of good stuff there, but I hope the characters develop more in the coming seasons, and we see a bit more range from two guys who definitely have it.The bonuses are good:  the making is fun to watch and the live performance of some of the sketches is also quite funny.There is indeed potential for Little Britain.",3,"Hilarious In Parts, Needs Help In Others",1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,1680,"['Lucas', 'Williams', 'irresistable', 'characters', 'Little', 'Britain', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'fine', 'examples', 'British', 'comedy', 'farcical', 'top', 'perverse', 'likely', 'be', 'incomprehensible', 'Americans', 'who', 'understand', 'humor', 'Monty', 'Python', '.I', 'do', 'however', 'feel', 'first', 'season', 'having', 'flashes', 'brilliance', 'need', 'further', 'development', 'hope', 'so', 'time', 'on.Most', 'characters', 'are', 'fairly', 'well-drawn', 'are', 'pretty', 'close', 'what', 'imagine', 'British', 'folk', 'sometimes', 'be', 'pompous', 'arrogant', 'flightly', 'self-delusing', 'class-conscious', 'same', 'token', 'fairly', 'decent', 'ordinary', 'men', 'women.I', 'think', 'sketches', 'labored', 'were', 'one-trick', 'ponies', 'Lou', 'Andy', 'one', 'know', 'Lou', 'going', 'stick', 'neck', 'out', 'Andy', ""'ll"", 'change', 'mind', 'last', 'moment', 'Been', 'there', 'done', 'will', 'Lou', 'ever', 'figure', 'out', 'Andy', 'can', 'walk', ""'d"", 'be', 'something', 'so', 'see.The', 'schoolmaster', 'who', 'former', 'student', 'boring', 'overdone', 'not', 'funny', 'Sorry', 'girl', 'be', 'bride', 'sketch', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'do.Now', 'other', 'schoolmaster', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'fantastic', 'had', 'several', 'public', 'school', 'More', 'do', 'want', 'see', 'Vicki', 'Oh', 'God', 'do', 'know', 'several', 'cigarette', 'puffing', 'screwball', 'trailer', 'trash', 'girl', 'howl', 'Really', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'there', 'hope', 'characters', 'develop', 'more', 'coming', 'seasons', 'see', 'bit', 'more', 'range', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'definitely', 'have', 'it.The', 'bonuses', 'are', 'good', 'making', 'fun', 'watch', 'live', 'performance', 'sketches', 'also', 'quite', 'indeed', 'potential', 'Little', 'Britain']",Little Britain: The Complete First Series
