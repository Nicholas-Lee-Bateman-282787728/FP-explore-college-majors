He is a comic genius with more all-time classic movies on his resume than virtually anyone else could hope for.  &quot;All of Me,&quot; &quot;The Jerk,&quot; &quot;Roxanne&quot;--the man has done a lot of great work across a wide range of comedic styles.  And Queen Latifah is talented and likable.  Witness the sadly-ignored &quot;Set it Off,&quot; which is a much better movie than you might expect, and which really showed that Queen Latifah had great potential as an actress.Martin and Latifah deserved a chance to do a good movie together.  They could have pulled off a decent movie from a mediocre script.  But instead, this is the movie you get when you take Steve Martin's lawyer character from &quot;All of Me,&quot; suck all of the character and life out of him, and plug him into &quot;Housesitter&quot; with Queen Latifah as Goldie Hawn.  There's even a rich old client, like in &quot;All of Me.&quot;  You get the feeling you've seen better versions of this movie before, and you're right.We all know the gag from the commercials.  Steve Martin thinks he's meeting some thin white lawyer for an internet date, but instead Queen Latifah shows up at his front door.  Comedy theoretically ensues.  But the movie takes its sweet time getting to this first surprise, even though we the audience know it's coming.  And in that interval, man, do they lay on the exposition.  Layer after layer of trite TV-movie exposition, written in such a way as to show you the path the movie is going to follow as to every single character.  Even after Queen Latifah shows up, the exposition just keeps on coming, and coming, and coming.  When it stops, you are hoping comedy might ensue, but it just doesn't.In the first 30 minutes of this movie, there are a few amusing moments, and two occasions where you might actually chuckle out loud.  That is a pathetic laugh ratio for any comedy, and it is unforgivable given that a truly awful script has dragged two great performers to that level.You know the comedies where you see the preview on TV and there are 3 or 4 funny clips, and you get to the movie, and those are the only 3 or 4 funny things in it?

612563,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,B00005JM4B,casualsuede,"[3, 3]","Let me first say that there is not one original idea in the movie. It steals from movies like Uncle Buck, Houseguest and Steve Martin's own Housesitter about the the unwelcome guest moving in and making life better for the main lead and their kids.The sort of novel idea is that the two main leads don't automatically become a couple (all the ingredients are there like initial trickery to gain access to the lead's life, chemistry but tension, tender reconciliation and the love interest proving themselves to be actually nice under their stone skins). It is interesting that Roger Ebert and a few other critics whine that this does not happen in their reviews, yet he always complains about Hollywood following their typical formula.Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) is a successful attorney who neglects his kid and his (now divorced) wife Kate (all cute, non-sexy California blondes are named Kate by the way) and has started an internet relationship with a personality named lawyergirl. When they decide to meet, she doesn't appear to a be a thin blonde attorney, but a shapely, black convict. Even worse, Sanderson's neighbor Mrs. Kline (Betty White) is a bigot as well as the sister of his boss. Charlene will not quit and at the end, they reach a comprimise and Peter begins investigating the case with his buddy Howie.The plot of this case, as you can see is very generic and only seems to happen in Hollywood. Of course, the ex-wife is waiting to come back into the relationship. Of course, the sidekick is ready to pick up female lead since formulaic wise the WASPY old man doesn't suit Charlene. Of course there is a wacky, b!tchy sister that meddles, the uptight hag that needs to be loosened up and of course the kids are messed up with problems that only Charlene can take care of. However, Queen Latifah takes her role with an earnesty that is refreshing to see and those who are Steve Martin fans from the past may like what they see, since his schtick really hasn't changed much over the years. However, his Bulworth routine is hilarious and he dances better than I ever thought he would (gotta see the scene to believe it). However, it is Eugene Levy who gets the laughs because he plays Howie as such a straight character.If you want a movie that is good for 12 years and up that is no more offensive than what is on TV, then this is a good bet, especially for March break.",3,Same old same old plot lifted by excellent performances,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,2390,"['Let', 'first', 'say', 'not', 'one', 'original', 'idea', 'movie', 'movies', 'Uncle', 'Buck', 'Houseguest', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'own', 'Housesitter', 'unwelcome', 'guest', 'moving', 'making', 'life', 'better', 'main', 'lead', 'kids.The', 'sort', 'novel', 'idea', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'do', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'become', 'couple', 'ingredients', 'are', 'there', 'initial', 'trickery', 'gain', 'access', 'lead', 'life', 'chemistry', 'tension', 'tender', 'reconciliation', 'love', 'interest', 'proving', 'be', 'actually', 'nice', 'stone', 'skins', 'interesting', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'few', 'other', 'critics', 'whine', 'not', 'happen', 'reviews', 'yet', 'always', 'Hollywood', 'following', 'typical', 'formula.Peter', 'Sanderson', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'successful', 'attorney', 'who', 'kid', 'now', 'divorced', 'wife', 'Kate', 'cute', 'non-sexy', 'California', 'blondes', 'are', 'named', 'Kate', 'way', 'started', 'internet', 'relationship', 'personality', 'named', 'lawyergirl', 'When', 'decide', 'meet', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'thin', 'blonde', 'attorney', 'shapely', 'black', 'convict', 'Even', 'worse', 'Sanderson', 'neighbor', 'Mrs.', 'Kline', 'Betty', 'White', 'bigot', 'as', 'well', 'sister', 'boss', 'Charlene', 'will', 'not', 'quit', 'end', 'reach', 'comprimise', 'Peter', 'investigating', 'case', 'buddy', 'Howie.The', 'plot', 'case', 'can', 'see', 'very', 'generic', 'only', 'happen', 'Hollywood', 'course', 'ex-wife', 'waiting', 'come', 'back', 'relationship', 'course', 'sidekick', 'ready', 'pick', 'up', 'female', 'lead', 'formulaic', 'wise', 'WASPY', 'old', 'man', ""n't"", 'suit', 'Charlene', 'course', 'wacky', 'b', 'tchy', 'sister', 'uptight', 'hag', 'be', 'loosened', 'up', 'course', 'kids', 'are', 'messed', 'up', 'problems', 'only', 'Charlene', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'However', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'role', 'earnesty', 'refreshing', 'see', 'who', 'are', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'fans', 'past', 'may', 'like', 'what', 'see', 'schtick', 'really', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', 'years', 'However', 'Bulworth', 'routine', 'hilarious', 'better', 'ever', 'thought', 'would', 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'scene', 'believe', 'However', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'who', 'laughs', 'Howie', 'such', 'straight', 'character.If', 'want', 'movie', 'good', '12', 'years', 'up', 'more', 'offensive', 'what', 'TV', 'then', 'good', 'bet', 'especially', 'March', 'break']",N/A

Who can then give the white southern person some weed to make them not racist anymore.This movie was very much about offensive sterotypes.

When was this woman born...1840 or something?Next, this film tries to accomplish way too much in just under 2 hours.  I see several major conflicts: Peter & Charlene (white vs. black), Peter & Mrs. Arness (Peter trying to get at Mrs. Arness' estate), Peter & his ex-wife (trying to get back together), Peter & his daughter (his daughter's spurt for independence), Peter's son's reading problem, Charlene & her being framed for a crime she didn't do.  I really wish the director could have just chosen two of the above and really focused instead of throwing every possible conflict at the screen.  It was disorienting and made following any one conflict almost impossible (as it was only discussed for maybe 5 minutes before hopping to the next conflict).Further, this film is loaded with sexuality that does little for the plot other than allow Queen Latifah feel sexy even when not a size 0.  Charlene makes so many remarks about her sex appeal, allows Peter's son to read one of his porn magazines (what the...?, and encourages a drunk Peter to open himself sexually for his ex-wife in a disgusting sequence (in which Betty White and son walk in on the action).  Further, Peter's daughter is almost raped (not funny and not important to the plot) and Peter's ex-wife is seeing a man that is barely older than the daughter!Lastly, this is minor, but why does it take Queen Latifah almost 15 minutes to knock Missi Pyle's lights out and only 5 seconds to knock out Michael Rosenbaum?  This is completely illogical.  Queen Latifah struggled with Missi for what seemed like forever in a battle for respect in which Missi is bludgeoned against a wall, head dunked in a toilet and hung on a wall.  Contrast this with her brief whack to Michael Rosenbaum which ends with him landing on a pillow (or dog toy), sleeping like a baby.  If Queen Latifah had a hard time knocking out a candy cane (Missi Pyle), she should have had just as much trouble with a divan (Michael Rosenbaum).  It just doesn't make sense otherwise.There were some genuinely funny points in the movie.  I enjoyed Eugene Levy's complete acceptance of Queen Latifah and their relationship at the end (Levy looks good in Jamacan beads!) and was pleased to see Peter and his ex-wife make up (for the sake of their kids).  But overall, I would never recommend this film; in fact, I would tell people to stay away and look elsewhere for a laughn that doesn't center on racial slurs and sex.Brought to you by*C.S.

612575,A2D4E93M8AIQEO,B00005JM4B,"Daniel Ari ""Ghas Phox""","[1, 1]","I had sincere misgivings about renting this movie. Steve Martin has lost so much allure for me since the days of Comedy Is Not Pretty and Wild and Crazy Guy, his two astonishing comedy records that influenced me for a lifetime. Giving in to old age, respectability, and being self-impressed with his frequent appearances is The New Yorker, Martin lost a lot of the wackiness that made The Jerk, Man With Two Brains, and Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid so enjoyable.Frankly, I have trouble forgetting his performance in Father of the Bride. I'm sure he was in more sappy, sloppy, mushy, family-style pap besides that one, but somehow that movie sticks in the craw of my memory, as it were, as the unfortunate compromise that disenchanted the funniest white man in America.Not only did I have misgivings about Martin, but also about the subject of Bringing Down the House, patently apparent from its cover even without the general hype that surrounded the theatrical release. I was going to have to watch a racial comedy where white people acted like black people. Not that this can't be funny, but it has been so overdone for so long that I despaired of seeing anything original enough to make me laugh. Spike Lee could do it with Bamboozled (reviewed in my archives), but he wasn't making a comedy.It was my dear wife, the lovely Mrs. Worsted, who requested a comedy, something mellow to zone out to. My choice at the video store, King of the Hill, looked heavy. Eugene Levy's presence in The House was good incentive to give it a shot, and then Jeff at Family Video and DVD said, ""It's pretty funny, actually,"" and that closed the deal.Jeff was right, and so was I. It is pretty funny, and Levy is in top form. On top of that, Martin is in top form, a delightful surprise. And Queen Latifah rounds out the top-form triumvirate. Not that you're in the presence of greatness with this movie, but it certainly does provide a decent night's entertainment.Bringing Down the House is the tale of Larry the Lawyer (Martin), a workaholic, up-tight tax attorney who falls into an Internet friendship with ""Lawyer_girl."" Separated from his wife, Larry decides to try meeting the girl in person, and is shocked to find that Charlene is a large, sassy, sexy black woman who recently got out of prison after being convicted of armed robbery.Charlene is obviously not what Larry had in mind: he is as white as they come, working for an upper-crust, racist law firm and living in an upper-crust, racist neighborhood, across the street from Betty White, who I always liked (and it pained me to see her play a rich bigot). Charlene's pursuit and deception of Larry isn't just for giggles. She claims to be innocent of the crime and in desperate need of legal assistance to clear her name. Larry refuses to help her, but Charlene has ways of changing his mind, mainly by playing her race against Larry's lifestyle. Pretending to be the mother of his lovechild, loudly on the front lawn, for example, regains her entry into his house.But race and class tensions don't always work in Charlene's favor. Larry is trying to court a billion-dollar client, a matronly woman whose attitudes seem to come through time and distance from the antebellum plantations of Georgia. Once Larry has been coerced into helping Charlene, he makes her pose as a nanny, a maid, and a church choir leader to keep his prejudiced compatriots satisfied that he'd never actually befriend an African American. The lawyer and the convict are thrown into situation after situation where racial tension is the source of comedy (especially when Larry finally leaves his white-bread world for Charlene's natural scene, deep downtown).Larry has two children whose struggles form the subplots. Charlene is the force that brings them out of their difficulties, the daughter with her adolescent shenanigans and the son with his difficulty in school. This helps create true friendship between the superwoman con (mother, lover, fighter, grifter, crusader) and the well-situated attorney. It also helps that Larry's colleague, played by Levy, has a thing for Charlene. To hear Levy speak in what sounded to me like passable Afro-urban parlance was, even familiar as it's become, funny. Furthermore, Levy's unbridled propensity--okay, lust--for Latifah makes him one of the more consistently likeable characters, second only to Latifah herself.Finally, Larry the lawyer becomes convinced of Charlene's innocence and begins to work to clear her name. Antics, shenanigans, intrigues and excitement ensue when Larry confronts the gangstas who set Charlene up. The rich prospective client and her French bulldog are kidnapped by Levy and Latifah. Guns go off; ganga is smoked; cops show up; and everything works out as you'd expect.For such a traditional comedy with such traditional laughs, Bringing Down does a good job of being likeable. The funny stuff is pretty funny and gags are not milked overlong (except for the fight scene between Charlene and Larry's sister in law). The fact that the comedy is all racially derived doesn't bother me much. I don't think the core message is racist considering that all the bigots are served their just deserts. I could imagine that the stereotypes could be problematic to someone more sensitive or consciousness-raised than I. I wonder what Spike Lee or bell hooks would think of this film. Regardless, I found a good helping of mirth and a welcome return of Steve Martin to actually funny comedy.",4,"Fun, much better than I expected.",1061769600,"08 25, 2003",2003,5474,"['had', 'sincere',

612579,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00005JM4B,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In 2003, the romantic comedy ""Bringing Down the House"" starring Steve Martin and Queen Latifah would earn over $164 million in the box office.Directed by Adam Shankman (""Hairspray"", ""Bedtime Stories"", ""A Walk to Remember"") and written by Jason Filardi (""17 Again"", ""Back Nine""), despite mixed reviews from critics, the film would become a financial success and also earning Queen Latifah a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture and also a Teen Choice Award for ""Choice Movie Actress Comedy"".And to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the film, Touchstone Home Video entertainment will be releasing the film on Blu-ray.VIDEO:Perhaps the biggest difference from the original DVD release of ""Bringing Down the House"" is the film's video quality.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:35:1), ""Bringing Down the House"" looks absolutely vibrant with this new digital transfer.The outdoor scenes look amazing, no sign of the artifacts from the older DVD release, the clarity and detail is much more apparent in the Blu-ray release and for those who love this film, may want to upgrade to this latest Blu-ray release.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Bringing Down the House"" is one of those films where you expect dialogue to be the primary focus and if anything, audio primarily coming from the center and front channels.  But ""Bringing Down the House"" is also a film known for its music soundtrack, from Queen Latifah to Robert Palmer, the soundtrack does have its fair share of  hip hop and pop music and the soundtrack does feature a good amount of bass during those music-driven scenes.  Dialogue is crystal clear and for the most part, the lossless soundtrack is definitely a step-up from the original DVD verison.SPECIAL FEATURES""Bringing Down the House: 10th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features:Breaking Down ""Bringing Down the House"" - (16:33) Interview with Adam Shankman and the cast of ""Bringing Down the House"".The Godfather Hop - (2:57) A featurette focusing on Eugene Levy's character, Howie.""Better than the Rest"" Music Video - (3:44) Queen Latifah's music video.Deleted Scenes - (4:10) Featuring four deleted scenes: Ashley Spies on Charlene, More Golfing with Arness, Howie confronts Peter on Humping and Charlene Bitch Slaps Mike.Gag Reel - (4:00) Featuring the bloopers from ""Bringing Down the House"".JUDGMENT CALL:While ""Bringing Down the House"" was not exactly a favorite of film critics, part of the success of the film is because of its mismatching of talents.  One would never expect Steve Martin and Queen Latifah to be in a film together, yet they did and for the most part succeeded.While Steve Martin usually delivers in his role, what brought a fun atmosphere was Queen Latifah, who served as Executive Producer for the film but also worked closely with director Adam Shankman and writer Jason Filardi to bring some credibility to her character, know what kind of slang and terminology would go well with the audience, especially since both are complete opposites but at the same time, during this point in their lives, they realize how much they need each other.It's hard to believe 10-years has gone by since the release of this film in theaters, and while most of the cast members have gone on to bigger things (especially the young Angus T. Jones, who is now among the highly paid actors on television (ala ""Two and a Half Men""), the film's comedy still works today as it did in 2003.  It's one thing to see Steve Martin deliver his one-liners, but to see Queen Latifah show off her comedy skills, even a little action with actress Missi Pyle, its the chemistry that seemed odd at first, comes together in this crazy, farcical film.  It's one of those films that you want to watch, get away from reality and just laugh at how crazy the situations are.Eugene Levy escapes from his fatherly comedy routine that he tends to play on the ""American Pie"" films and plays the sex-crazed lawyer who just lusts after Charlene and is blunt of how he feels towards her. Betty White plays the bigot neighbor across the street who runs out of the house after hearing Charlene scream and telling Peter ""I hear Negro!"".  There are jokes that Queen Latifah brought to the film, that may raise eyebrows but she knew what jokes would work well with a diverse audience.As for the Blu-ray release, the film looks fantastic and definitely an upgrade over the previous DVD release.  The special features are pretty much the same content that was on the original DVD but for those who want to upgrade or those strictly looking for a comedy to watch and have a good time, ""Bringing Down the House"" is a film worth considering.Sure it's farcical film that may be too absurd for some,  but for those who aren't looking for anything too serious but something just to watch and laugh, will find ""Bringing Down the House"" an entertaining comedy.Overall, ""Bringing Down the House"" is a hilarious and fun comedy that will make people laugh today as it did ten years ago.",4,"(3.5

The acting is absolutely atrocious and the script is horrible and without any strengths. Steve Martin really drops the ball with awful acting and embarrassing attempts at humor. He's better than that. Queen Latifah fares little better.What also kills this movie for me is how offensive and excessively stereotypical it is. The dumbest part for me was when the character played by Martin dresses up as some hip-hop raver just made me laugh in derision at the scene. Not that it's obscene but it's just such a massive joke for such a talented actor to really slip on a banana peel like this. What were you thinking Steve? (Shakes head) I also hated the stereotypes that this movie seems to bring up about the African-American societies in this country even though in some ways we are still quite polarized.This movie was already doomed to begin with even when it had potential. &quot;Bringing Down THe House&quot; could really have been a funny, witty, and original movie but whatever on Earth happened in it's making, it really destroys this movie.BDTH is complete rubbish and should be depolymerized immediately because it's a waste of natural resources and we cannot afford to waste them on making such God-awful movies.

Queen Latifah and Steve Martin are the perfect comedy team and Eugene Levy adds just the right flair to make this movie memorable.  Peter is an uptight attorney conversing on the internet with what he believes is a petite blonde attorney.  After inviting her to the house, he is shocked and dismayed to find an ex-con Charlene bursting through the door demanding that he look over her case.  Kicking her out, she has many tricks up her sleeve and eventually finds her way into his life in ways neither of them expect.I think what alot of people find so distasteful about this film is the racism coming from some white people.  As I had lived in an upscale white neighborhood at one time, I can honestly say there are people just like this.  More than you would ever dare imagine.  What makes this movie so good is the way this is shown in a thought-provoking yet funny way.  Yes, there are offensive things in this film but it makes fun of everybody.I love the romance between Latifah and Levy.  The fistfight at the country club with the awful sister of Martin's ex-wife.  The movie has a great ending and everyone is changed for the better.If you are offended easily, stay away from this movie.  If you have no sense of humour, stay away.

Charlene's nemesis, the racist predator who goes after sick old rich men for their money, wears a bathing suit like lingerie under an open robe as she demonstrates what she learned from Quentin Tarantino movies and tai-bo classes.After minutes of brutal violence Charlene hangs the unconscious gold-digger up on a hook like a piece of meat.  Comedies like this usually set someone up to be satisfyingly slapped down, but the sexism in this scene was jarring.  These two women were so obviously on display.  It took me out of the formula story of the rich guy (here a tax lawyer) who's losing his family because he spends all his time working, but who is taught what's really important by the outsider who forces herself into his life (here an innocent woman from the hood framed for a robbery who blackmails the lawyer into clearing her).Another scene was disturbing.  Lawyer Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) is talking to his teenage daughter after Charlene has rescued her from a ""bad boy"" she snuck off to a party with who tried to force her into sex.  Peter, the clueless father who thought his daughter had gone out with a preppy young man instead of a slimeball, tries to process everything she tells him.  When she tells her father how far the boy got with her, you can see how relieved he is that she wasn't ""violated.""  You don't get the impression he would abandon her if she had been raped, but it's clear he doesn't think what did happen was as bad.  It's a little more okay because his daughter's still a virgin.I watched this movie because Eugene Levy is in it, and I'd just been blown away by his performance in A Mighty Wind.  Levy is funny as ""freakboy,"" Peter's law partner who falls in love with Charlene, and Steve Martin and Queen Latifah are both very good actors.  The movie isn't meant to be anything more than a dumb comedy.  But once you start thinking about the way women are presented, you ask the question Peter does when he goes to The Down Low dressed up like a gansta to clear Charlene:  ""What's the dealio?",3,All Caught Up in the Game,1078790400,"03 9, 2004",2004,2444,"['Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'predictable', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'cringing', 'Charlene', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'starting', 'kung-fu-ing', 'skinny', 'white', 'ho', 'country', 'club', 'room.The', 'fight', 'scene', 'pornographic', 'centerpiece', 'too', 'long', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'got', 'strongest', 'audience', 'reaction', 'cheers', 'whistles', 'teenage', 'boys', 'shouting', 'Yeah', 'when', 'movie', 'played', 'multiplexes', 'Charlene', 'nemesis', 'racist', 'predator', 'who', 'sick', 'old', 'rich', 'men', 'money', 'bathing', 'suit', 'lingerie', 'open', 'robe', 'what', 'learned', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'movies', 'tai-bo', 'classes.After', 'minutes', 'brutal', 'violence', 'Charlene', 'unconscious', 'gold-digger', 'up', 'hook', 'piece', 'meat', 'Comedies', 'usually', 'set', 'someone', 'up', 'be', 'satisfyingly', 'slapped', 'down', 'sexism', 'scene', 'was', 'jarring', 'two', 'women', 'were', 'so', 'obviously', 'display', 'took', 'formula', 'story', 'rich', 'guy', 'here', 'tax', 'lawyer', 'who', 'losing', 'family', 'time', 'working', 'who', 'taught', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'outsider', 'who', 'life', 'here', 'innocent', 'woman', 'hood', 'framed', 'robbery', 'who', 'lawyer', 'clearing', 'scene', 'was', 'disturbing', 'Lawyer', 'Peter', 'Sanderson', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'talking', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Charlene', 'rescued', 'bad', 'boy', 'snuck', 'off', 'party', 'who', 'tried', 'force', 'sex', 'Peter', 'clueless', 'father', 'who', 'thought', 'daughter', 'had', 'gone', 'out', 'preppy', 'young', 'man', 'instead', 'slimeball', 'tries', 'process', 'everything', 'When', 'father', 'how', 'far', 'boy', 'got', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'relieved', 'was', ""n't"", 'violated', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'impression', 'would', 'abandon', 'had', 'been', 'raped', 'clear', ""n't"", 'think', 'what', 'did', 'happen', 'was', 'bad', 'little', 'more', 'okay', 'daughter', 'still', 'virgin.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'Eugene', 'Levy', ""'d"", 'just', 'been', 'blown', 'away', 'performance', 'A', 'Mighty', 'Wind', 'Levy', 'funny', 'freakboy', 'Peter', 'law', 'partner', 'who', 'love', 'Charlene', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'movie', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'dumb', 'comedy', 'once', 'start', 'thinking', 'way', 'women', 'are', 'presented', 'ask', 'question', 'Peter', 'when', 'Down', 'Low', 'dressed', 'up', 'gansta', 'clear', 'Charlene', 'What', 'dealio']",N/A

Martin's shifts from being an uptight lawyer to posing as a hip rapper.  His antics in the club are truly amusing.

Eugene Levy is quite entertaining as Martin's side kick.  He varies his role ever so slightly from the series of American Pie movies.  But the fit is a good one.The storyline however is a bit ridiculous.  How Queen Latifah's character takes over Martin's palce with a gangster party questions the authenticy of Martin's security system which was employed only a couple of scenes earlier.  Also the many shifts with Latifah being a maid and a love interest grows a little cumbersome in spots.If you do not take this movie too seriously you might like it.

What I didn't know, however, was that it would be a blatant rip-off of You've Got Mail, with Martin failing to fill Tom Hanks' shoes, Latifah (I refuse to call her a queen) playing the equivalent of two Meg Ryans, and some of the most painful scenes ever caught on film.In case you can't see it coming, there's a decent chance that Latifah and Martin will dance together and she'll either teach him or disapprove of his spastic, uncoordinated, rehashed and unfunny King Tut act.  But I won't ""ruin it"" for you.  Oh, and you guessed it, the older white guys - which includes the lamest person in history: Eugene Levy - all make feeble attempts at ebonics that cause ever-increasing groans and cringes with each ignorant usage.  There has never been a more out of touch combo in history.  In fact, I'd say neither has EVER been hip.It's truly baffling to me how anyone could convince so many black people to be in such a racially stereotypical movie.  After this movie, I'm convinced that ""The Man"" does exist, and he's a producer in Hollywood attempting to perpetuate the racial divide.  To be honest, I'd swear that Steve Martin is complicit, because between him and Levy, they've taken back racial understanding roughly 10-20 years.

While the story and action are silly and unrealistic in many scenes, the main duo of Martin &amp; Latifah bring charisma to their roles, while the story is spiced up by subplots, one involving a character played by Eugene Levy (The Dad from the American Pie films), another involving veteran English actress Joan Plowright, and additional supporting roles by Jean Smart as Martin's ex-wife and another actress playing a nasty sister-in-law.  The one scene that I think should have been pared down or removed is where Latifah and the sister-in-law get in a vicious, bruising fight.  Betty White has a small role as a racist neighbor who happens to be the sister of Martin's boss, making for some good laughs.  Overall, this story is contrived, formulaic, and seemingly tasteless at times, yet it works very well due to great casting and performances, which make the humor in the film seem funnier than it otherwise might be.

If we are grading on the social worth of this movie (compared to other Martin movies like L.A. Story, a 5 star story or Roxanne, a four only because it is a knock off of Cyrano) this movie doesn't even make one star.THE PLOT - Steve Martin is a tax attorney in a conservative tax office and is trying to reel in the multi million dollar account of an exceedingly conservative and somewhat eccentric old heiress.  When he sets up a blind date with an internet acquaintance, Lawyer girl, it turns out to be Charlene - an escaped convict trying to clear her name of the armed robbery charge for which she was falsely imprisoned. While that would be a suitable description for her in most movies, it is also a big deal in this movie that she is black. Not able to get rid of her, she moves in - ostensibly as the nannny - until he can get her name cleared. Typical hijinx ensue. The only thing that was really entertaining was Eugene Levy who pursues Charlene throughout the movie but then we start getting into the problem with some of the ridiculous things he says.THE PROBLEM - From the start, almost all plot points are based on race. All the whites are openly bigotted. Betty White as Martin's neighbor says she doesn't want to see hispanics in the neighborhood unless they have a leafblower. Terms &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; and &quot;jungle love&quot; are just the beginning.  All of the blacks in the movie speak presumably some type of hip hop language that bears no resemblance to anything.

612617,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JM4B,Joe Sherry,"[3, 5]","A Film by Adam ShankmanAfter all the money this movie made and after hearing all the hype about how funny Bringing Down the House is supposed to be, I finally got around to renting the movie.  I don't know what my expectations were, but I thought it was going to be funnier than it actually was.  This movie was somewhat of a let down.The premise of the movie has Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) looking forward to meeting a woman that he met on the internet.  From the picture, she looks like an attractive, professional, white woman.  Normally I wouldn't mention race unless it was meaningful for the movie, and in this case it is.  When Peter finally meets this woman, she turns out to be Charlene (Queen Latifah), a black woman who looks nothing like the white woman Peter expected.  Charlene is in the picture, however.  She is in the background being taken away in handcuffs.  The humor in the movie works on the idea of the streetwise black woman clashing with the culture of the elite, rich white man and his world.  Fairly standard.Charlene needs Peter to help her clear her name as she claims to have ""done the time, but I didn't do the crime"".  There is some humor in Peter trying to get rid of Charlene and Charlene not getting out of his life.  The best scenes occur when Peter's lawyer co-worker Howie Rottman (Eugene Levy) meets Charlene.  Howie talks to Charlene with street slang and it just sounds funny coming out of Eugene Levy's mouth.  Levy truly is golden.At the same time that Peter is trying to help Charlene (was there any doubt), he is also trying to land a huge account for his law firm, in the person of Mrs. Arness (Joan Plowright).  Mrs. Arness is an eldery white woman who is a throwback to a more prejudiced time.  She lives in a world of white privilege where the only black people she knows of are servants.  I would like to be able to say that hilarity ensues, but it really doesn't.  There is an occasional funny line, but the culture clash between Charlene and Mrs. Arness doesn't quite work.The other bit of amusement I got from this movie (aside from Eugene Levy) was Peter dressing up in some sort of a hip hop outfit and going into a club where he would not normally be able to go.  He passes himself off as having some sort of street cred, and has some fairly funny lines as he tries to establish himself in the club.  Steve Martin plays the straight man throughout this movie and when he breaks out to try to be hip, it comes off as funny.As I mentioned earlier in the review, the entire plot of the movie felt far too predictable and this detracted from the humor in the movie...well, that and a lot of it just wasn't funny.  The movie had it's moments, but that's all it felt like, a collection of funny moments ruined by a boring, ordinary plot.  On the plus side, the movie did have Betty White in a glorified cameo as a racist neighbor (Betty White always gets great lines).  Even though other people surely will, I can't recommend this movie.",3,"too predictable, but Eugene Levy is golden",1060560000,"08 11, 2003",2003,2991,"['Film', 'Adam', 'ShankmanAfter', 'money', 'movie', 'made', 'hearing', 'hype', 'how', 'funny', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'supposed', 'be', 'finally', 'got', 'renting', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expectations', 'were', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'funnier', 'actually', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'somewhat', 'let', 'down.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'Peter', 'Sanderson', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'looking', 'forward', 'meeting', 'woman', 'met', 'internet', 'picture', 'attractive', 'professional', 'white', 'woman', 'Normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'mention', 'race', 'was', 'meaningful', 'movie', 'case', 'When', 'Peter', 'finally', 'woman', 'out', 'be', 'Charlene', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'nothing', 'white', 'woman', 'Peter', 'expected', 'Charlene', 'picture', 'however', 'background', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'handcuffs', 'humor', 'movie', 'idea', 'streetwise', 'black', 'woman', 'clashing', 'culture', 'elite', 'rich', 'white', 'man', 'world', 'Fairly', 'standard.Charlene', 'needs', 'Peter', 'help', 'clear', 'name', 'have', 'done', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'crime', 'humor', 'Peter', 'trying', 'get', 'rid', 'Charlene', 'Charlene', 'not', 'getting', 'life', 'best', 'scenes', 'occur', 'when', 'Peter', 'lawyer', 'co-worker', 'Howie', 'Rottman', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Charlene', 'Howie', 'talks', 'Charlene', 'street', 'slang', 'just', 'funny', 'coming', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'mouth', 'Levy', 'truly', 'golden.At', 'same', 'time', 'Peter', 'trying', 'help', 'Charlene', 'was', 'there', 'doubt', 'also', 'trying', 'land', 'huge', 'account', 'law', 'firm', 'person', 'Mrs.', 'Arness', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'Mrs.', 'Arness', 'eldery', 'white', 'woman', 'who', 'throwback', 'more', 'prejudiced', 'time', 'world', 'white', 'privilege', 'where', 'only', 'black', 'people', 'are', 'servants', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'really', ""n't"", 'occasional', 'funny', 'line', 'culture', 'clash', 'Charlene', 'Mrs.', 'Arness', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work.The', 'other', 'bit', 'amusement', 'got', 'movie', 'aside', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'was', 'Peter', 'dressing', 'up', 'sort', 'hip', 'hop', 'outfit', 'going', 'club', 'where', 'would', 'not', 'normally', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'off', 'having', 'sort', 'street', 'cred', 'fairly', 'funny', 'lines', 'establish', 'club', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'straight', 'man', 'movie', 'when', 'out', 'try', 'be', 'hip', 'off', 'funny.As', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'review', 'entire', 'plot', 'movie', 'felt', 'far', 'too', 'predictable', 'detracted', 'humor', 'movie', 'well', 'lot', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'movie', 'had', 'moments', 'felt', 'collection', 'funny', 'moments', 'ruined', 'boring', 'ordinary', 'plot', 'plus', 'side', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'Betty', 'White', 'glorified', 'cameo', 'racist', 'neighbor', 'Betty', 'White', 'always', 'great', 'lines', 'Even', 'other', 'people', 'surely', 'will', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

Martin and Latifah do set off some sparks together and Eugene Levy, Betty White and Joan Plowright support them well in parts which they play better than they are written.

612629,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JM4B,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","Some of the comments I heard about &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; made me think that this was going to be the cinematic equivalent of when Ted Danson showed up at the Friar's Club in blackface to roast his then paramour Whoopi Goldberg.  But I certainly did not find this 2003 comedy starring Steve Martin and Queen Latifah to be offensive, just not as funny as your would think it would be given the cast assembled for the festivities, which includes Eugene Levy, Joan Plowright, and Jean Smart.Actually, the problem with this film is the casting.  Steve Martin should not have done this movie because his character, tax lawyer and divorced dad Peter Sanderson, is supposed to be the straight man surrounded by crazy people.  When Martin gets the chance to do his shtick, primarily when he is getting lessons on being sexually aggressive and when he lays down his hip hop moves, it really runs against the grain of his character in the rest of the movie.  Consequently, we are left in the strange situation where Martin is arguably the fifth funniest person in the film.  Queen Latifah, as Charlene Morton, the woman Sanderson hooks up with on the Internet only to discover she is an ex-con looking to be cleared of a bum rap, has the best moments in the film.  Levy, as Sanderson's freaky lawyer friend, does not quite carry off the ability to get down with the funk lingo, but his persistence becomes somewhat endearing.  Lady Olivier has the funniest scene in the film when she starts singing an old Negro spiritual as she reminsceneces about the good old days.  Even Missi Pyle as Sanderson's ex-wife's sister, Ashley, has a pretty good moment when she literally goes toe-to-toe with Charlene.  Martin has those previously mentioned scenes where he tries hard, but none of them are really the best moments in the movie.&quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; is an interesting combination between two types of films because on the one hand you have a modern screwball comedy where an oddball couple come together, but on the other you have the Mary Poppins bit going on where the outsider comes into the home and turns everybody into better persons and recreates a happy family.  It might have been more interesting if the film had stayed true to that first genre, but then we would have been in &quot;Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?&quot; territory and Hollywood is not going to go down that particular road with Martin and Latifah.At the end of this film I was thinking that Steve Martin needs to be a bit more selective in picking his film projects.  But as for Queen Latifah, between this and &quot;Chicago,&quot; it is clear that her majesty can do pretty good with any film project she wants to tackle.  It is not surprising that she comes out of &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; with her reputation enhanced.  This is one of those films that grades out at 3.5 stars.  A Steve Martin fan is going to round down, but a Queen Latifah fan will round up, and I remain her majesty's loyal subject.",4,Actually would have been a better film without Steve Martin,1063843200,"09 18, 2003",2003,3005,"['comments', 'heard', 'quot', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'quot', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'when', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'showed', 'up', 'Friar', 'Club', 'blackface', 'roast', 'then', 'paramour', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'find', '2003', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'be', 'offensive', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'cast', 'assembled', 'festivities', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'Jean', 'Smart.Actually', 'problem', 'film', 'casting', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'movie', 'character', 'tax', 'lawyer', 'divorced', 'dad', 'Peter', 'Sanderson', 'supposed', 'be', 'straight', 'man', 'surrounded', 'crazy', 'people', 'When', 'Martin', 'chance', 'do', 'shtick', 'primarily', 'when', 'getting', 'lessons', 'being', 'sexually', 'aggressive', 'when', 'down', 'hip', 'hop', 'moves', 'really', 'grain', 'character', 'rest', 'movie', 'Consequently', 'are', 'left', 'strange', 'situation', 'where', 'Martin', 'arguably', 'fifth', 'funniest', 'person', 'film', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Charlene', 'Morton', 'woman', 'Sanderson', 'up', 'Internet', 'only', 'discover', 'ex-con', 'looking', 'be', 'cleared', 'bum', 'rap', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'Levy', 'Sanderson', 'freaky', 'lawyer', 'friend', 'not', 'quite', 'carry', 'off', 'ability', 'get', 'down', 'funk', 'lingo', 'persistence', 'somewhat', 'endearing', 'Lady', 'Olivier', 'funniest', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'singing', 'old', 'Negro', 'spiritual', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'Even', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'Sanderson', 'ex-wife', 'sister', 'Ashley', 'pretty', 'good', 'moment', 'when', 'literally', 'toe-to-toe', 'Charlene', 'Martin', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'scenes', 'where', 'hard', 'none', 'are', 'really', 'best', 'moments', 'movie.', 'quot', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'quot', 'interesting', 'combination', 'two', 'types', 'films', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'modern', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'where', 'oddball', 'couple', 'come', 'together', 'other', 'have', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'bit', 'going', 'where', 'outsider', 'home', 'everybody', 'better', 'persons', 'happy', 'family', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'had', 'stayed', 'true', 'first', 'genre', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quot', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'quot', 'territory', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'down', 'particular', 'road', 'Martin', 'Latifah.At', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'thinking', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'selective', 'picking', 'film', 'projects', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'quot', 'Chicago', 'quot', 'clear', 'majesty', 'can', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'project', 'tackle', 'not', 'surprising', 'quot', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'quot', 'reputation', 'enhanced', 'one', 'films', 'out', '3.5', 'stars', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'fan', 'going', 'round', 'down', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'fan', 'will', 'round', 'up', 'remain', 'majesty', 'loyal', 'subject']",N/A

After a few movies that seem to have gone nowhere (does anyone remember NOVOCAINE?) he returns to form in the movie BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE.Martin stars as uptight and pure white tax attorney Peter Sanderson. Divorced, yet still in love with his wife, a father, yet having no time for his children, Sanderson finds a few moments to make a friend online. Via chatroom, he makes the acquaintance of Charlene Morton, a woman he thinks to be another lawyer, a petite blonde in the picture she's sent his way. And Charlene is about to show up at Sanderson's house for a first face to face meeting.Imagine his surprise when he opens the door to find Charlene (Queen Latifah) is not at all what he expected. The petite blonde has been replaced by a sassy and hip black woman who is all that and more. On closer inspection, she points out his misconception, blowing up the picture so he can see her being arrested in the background.Wanting nothing to do with her, he does his best to get her out of his house. But Charlene has come with one goal in mind and that is to get his help in reopening her case. She claims she was framed for a robbery she didn't commit. And she's not leaving without his help.A series of events, including his attempts to woo a new wealthy conservative client (Joan Plowright) result in his doing his best to help Charlene. And as he does so, she involves herself with his family. His two children are staying with him for the week and during that time, Charlene helps them with their problems and Sanderson in getting better acquainted with his own children.The back and forth of Charlene's case with Sanderson's attempts to nail down his new client make for some fantastic laughs. References back and forth between hip hop lifestyles and posh white elitism show the differences of the two worlds and at the same time the fact that the two worlds are more alike than most people realize. This equation lends itself to laughter on the highest end.Martin turns in one of his best performances ever, never quite going over the top in his portrayal of the square, seeming more real but still bland. He's an actor that has the ability to come off as normal in some films but far too out of bounds in others. Here, he plays it just right. And when he doffs the white bread world for an attempt to get down with his bad self, he shines the light of laughter even brighter.Latifah has always shone she can be funny. But in this movie she outdoes herself. She is bright and bold and beautiful in her own way, and that way sparks all sorts of laughter and sympathy for a character in trouble and in need of a friend. While all of this has been shown before, her run at physical comedy alongside Martin shows that she can hang in there with the best of them.The comedy here is not forced and some of it is expected but you know what? Who cares? As long as you get a good laugh out if it isn't that the whole point? And this movie is filled with laughter.The rest of the cast, including Eugene Levy and Jean Smart turn in equally great performances. But it is Martin and Latifah who shine here.

Also adding some fun are supporting actors Eugene Levy, Betty White and Joan Plowright. It's as though these performers got together and decided to put on a good show despite the script's glaring defects.As the movie opens, Paul [Martin], a divorced Los Angeles tax lawyer with two kids, is carrying on an e-mail correspondence with a woman he has never met. She calls herself Lawyer Girl and has lead Paul to believe she is a successful attorney like himself. Later, when the woman, whose name is Charlene [Latifah], shows up at his door, not only is she big and black rather than petite and white as Paul expected, she's also an escaped convict. What follows is a very predictable story with even more predictable characters - uptight white guy is loosened up by hip black chick, guy's kids' problems are solved, ex-wife takes a second look at guy, noisy neighbor gets an eyeful, rich client gets her comeuppance, etc.Martin and Latifah play easily off each other - two master comedians out to make us laugh. And laugh we do, but mostly because these two are so good at what they do. If the material had been better, this might have been a comedy classic rather than a mildly diverting movie. I suspect that where the movie goes off track is in its insistence on sugarcoating the story.

In many of his recent movies, he's being held up by other cast members, so viewers will practically ignore him, and like the rest of the film. Here, Queen Latifah carries the film, and she does it brilliantly. I wasn't sure whether I'd like her as an actress or not - hence, it took me two tries to watch this film, the first time I watched it, I switched it off after 20 minutes.This time it fared a little better, and I managed to sit right the way through it. Queen Latifah is basically the best thing about this, and Eugene Levy also, but he's seriously underused, and almost sleazy? There's a very cringe-worthy moment, where Steve pretends to be a rapper - every stereotype he uses. The really baggy clothes, the chains, the language that no one else can understand the hand movements. If you thought Steve Martin still had a sense of humour, and could make people laugh, then watch that scene alone. It's embarrassing, and makes you want to switch off the film. For future reference Steve: NO!This film yields no surprises, and is the same as many other films out there. The storyline has been done before: a straight-laced, uptight career-minded person, is taken off the straight & narrow by a wild, just out of jail person. How many times does this have to be done? It shouldn't have been a hit this movie, and should have quietly slipped under the radar of your usual cinema goers.After years of loving Steve Martin in the two Father Of The Bride films (yes, I own them), I'm disappointed to say, he's lost it, and will probably never get it back.

She can be funny at times, but she can also be blustery, obnoxious and a little overbearing.  I'm not sure if this is the character or perhaps the Queen herself?The movie actually gets its boost from Joan Plowright and Eugene Levy.  Plowright plays the snooty rich lady whose account Martin is trying to sew up; her scene in the nightclub is hilarious and it's to the marvelous British actress' credit that she comes across so well.  Cheerio, Ms. Plowright.  Levy plays Martin's buddy and his infatuation, no let's say lust, for Latifah gives the movie a comic thrust.  Kimberly J.

Queen Latifah's character repeatedly states that she was framed, so she blackmails Steve Martin's character into helping prove her innocence.Here, we witness Steve Martin tackling a role in which we've probably never seen him undertake (at least in his transformation from stiff lawyer, to lively person speaking in Eubonics), and Queen Latifah proves that she is one of the most versatile actresses in the business. I believe this woman can do anything she sets her mind to.The hilarious scenes tend to overshadow the underlying dialogue, which may be seen as a flaw in the film, but it really doesn't bother me too much. Also worth noting, racial stereotypes are poked at largely throughout the film, so some may be slightly offended (or annoyed) by this. Both African-Americans and Caucasians are not spared. But, this was all done in the funniest, most tongue-in-cheek kind of way, so it's not anything to be taken too seriously. Besides that, racial stereotyping has seemingly become standard these days in modern film (and TV), if you really think about it. Sometimes, you just have to laugh at stupidity (e.g. racism), as I believe the writers were poking derision at racists and ignoramuses in general. Not only that, as mentioned above, the racial stereotyping is something that can be found in quite a few movies today, but are done in lighthearted fashion. An attempt at parody, or a project falling into the routine of modern culture? You decide.A favorite funny scene:(1). Steve Martin's character is drunk as a skunk, and Queen Latifah is teaching him how to become more..desirable, by teaching him some &quot;moves.&quot; One thing leads to another, and one of Steve Martin's associates catches the two lying on top of one another, and we all know what the scene suggested. I admit, that the outcome of the scene was quite predictable, as I knew what was going to happen.I would list more favorite funny scenes, but I refuse to, in fear of coming across as something in which I totally despise and disagree with. You get one guess at what I'm referring to!Actor Eugene Levy turns in quite a funny performance as well, as he admires Queen Latifah's brashness in character, and tries to emulate her as much as possible. Predictable, innovative or not, an hilarious film, in which I probably never would have watched, if my family hadn't asked me to watch it with them.

He thinks he has met the perfect match in on online chat room - petite, blonde lawyer, Charlene.  They are going to meet for the first time that evening for dinner and Peter is sure that they have a lot in common.  So when Charlene (Queen Latifah), big, loud and black shows up for dinner, Peter is certain that she has the wrong house.  Turns out that Charlene escaped from prison and is out to prove that she was innocent of the crime she was convicted of and she needs Peter's help.  Peter, who can't afford to be seen with someone who is black and an ex-con, quickly gets rid of her by trickery, only to find her back at his house the next day having a pool party.  After Charlene threatens to ruin Peter's chance at winning a big new account for his firm, an account with an ultra conservative, aged, very wealthy widow (Joan Plowright), Peter agrees to help Charlene out a little.  However, as Peter gets more involved in the case, he comes to discover that Charlene really is innocent.

I was watching this movie with my sisters, brother-in-law, and my parents and I was embarrassed.  I fast-forwarded through whole chapters on the DVD, simply because I felt that the humor was grossly inappropriate for my nephews, who were also watching the show.  The movie did have a few funny parts, such as the ending where Steve Martin is at the hip hop club and trying to dance and speak like a black person, but I found the funny parts few and far between.  The plot was also way too simplistic and I felt that it could have been made a bit more original, especially with the talents employed here to make the film.

Of course, in the middle of such stories, there was always a sympathetic friend or two to teach her how to be fun and beautiful, ditch the glasses and books, loosen her attitudes and hair, enjoy rock music and dancing, and finally become the ""it"" girl who gets the guy.This tremendously bad bad movie with Martin and Latifah tiredly updates this tired story with racial boundaries standing in for social ones. I learned from this movie that black people are always blessedly hip, white people are almost invariably uptight and racist, and that the goals of life are 1) to be as limber as possible, 2) to spout street jargon smoothly, and 3) to initiate pre-pubescent kids into the world of reading with T&A; magazines.The only whites exempt from tight-buttitude are two kids (kids are hip by default in such stories, and are by nature more wise than their benighted parents) and a curious mutant creature played by Eugene Levy -- a middle-class laywer so up on the very latest urban lingo that each of his utterances seems like a tape recorded reading of a hip-hop lexicon.The script wears Levy out with this supposedly comic device until you realize you were sick of it the first time he did it. In fact, the first time ANYONE does their ""characteristic"" thing in this flick (Latifah doing her head-swerves, Betty White making a disparaging comment about another race, Missi Pyle sneering bitchiness) we instantly know that nothing original, fun, or nice will be forthcoming.I chuckled a couple of times, but I hated myself later.

Too bad this stuff makes money. It means not just that more junk like it will be produced, but that our culture is a pigpen full of slop-feeders.

612672,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,B00005JM4B,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[1, 2]","Adam Shankman's ""Bringing Down the House"" is a strange hybrid of a film.  It is not a comedy, it is not a thriller, and it is not a drama.  As strange as it sounds, it is all of the above.  Does this make for a disorienting viewing experience?  You bet.  Yet, somehow, someway, the film still manages to hold together.Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) is an attorney who gets more than he bargains for when he arranges a date with a woman he has met in an Internet chat room.  It turns out that the Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) who shows up at his doorstep is not the woman he was expecting but rather a fugitive who is looking for an attorney to re-open her case.  Peter becomes more and more frustrated as Charlene refuses to go away and finally agrees to help her if she just stops creating more trouble for him.  Eventually Charlene proves to be extremely valuable to Peter as she helps him piece together his personal life.  However, danger unexpectedly intrudes into Peter's life when he learns that the crime Charlene was accused of actually was not what it appeared to be.There are a lot of aspects of ""Bringing Down the House"" to admire.  Both Martin and Latifah are great in their parts and work well opposite each other.  Eugene Levy also is hilarious in a solid supporting turn.  Furthermore, the pace of the film is extremely brisk as the film never drags.  However, there are a lot of aspects to the film that also causes you to scratch your head.  Peter's evolving relationship with his family is supposedly an important element of the screenplay but none of his family members are adequately developed into anything substantial.  In addition, the supporting characters of Mrs. Arness (Joan Plowright) and Mrs. Kline (Betty White) are not funny and come perilously close to being outright offensive.  Also, the subplot involving Peter's sister-in-law (Missi Pyle) is unnecessary.  Still, ""Bringing Down the House"" is passably amusing.  It is no masterwork by any stretch of the imagination but there is enough good stuff in here to make watching it worthwhile.",3,"""Naw . . . it's more like a milk of mint.""",1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,2075,"['Adam', 'Shankman', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'strange', 'hybrid', 'film', 'not', 'comedy', 'not', 'thriller', 'not', 'drama', 'As', 'strange', 'above', 'make', 'disorienting', 'viewing', 'experience', 'bet', 'somehow', 'someway', 'film', 'still', 'hold', 'together.Peter', 'Sanderson', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'attorney', 'who', 'more', 'when', 'date', 'woman', 'met', 'Internet', 'chat', 'room', 'out', 'Charlene', 'Morton', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'up', 'doorstep', 'not', 'woman', 'was', 'expecting', 'rather', 'fugitive', 'who', 'looking', 'attorney', 're-open', 'case', 'Peter', 'more', 'more', 'frustrated', 'Charlene', 'go', 'away', 'finally', 'help', 'just', 'creating', 'more', 'trouble', 'Eventually', 'Charlene', 'be', 'extremely', 'valuable', 'Peter', 'piece', 'together', 'personal', 'life', 'However', 'danger', 'unexpectedly', 'Peter', 'life', 'when', 'crime', 'Charlene', 'was', 'accused', 'actually', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'appeared', 'be.There', 'are', 'lot', 'aspects', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'admire', 'Martin', 'Latifah', 'are', 'great', 'parts', 'work', 'well', 'opposite', 'other', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'also', 'hilarious', 'solid', 'supporting', 'turn', 'Furthermore', 'pace', 'film', 'extremely', 'brisk', 'film', 'never', 'However', 'are', 'lot', 'aspects', 'film', 'also', 'scratch', 'head', 'Peter', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'family', 'supposedly', 'important', 'element', 'screenplay', 'none', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'adequately', 'developed', 'anything', 'substantial', 'addition', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Mrs.', 'Arness', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'Mrs.', 'Kline', 'Betty', 'White', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'come', 'perilously', 'close', 'being', 'outright', 'offensive', 'Also', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Peter', 'sister-in-law', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'unnecessary', 'Still', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'passably', 'amusing', 'masterwork', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'enough', 'good', 'stuff', 'here', 'make', 'watching', 'worthwhile']",N/A

Sure, he was good in &quot;Spanish Prisoner&quot; and &quot;Novocane,&quot; but this is the kind of film we fans wanted to see.  And delightful Queen Latifah is also great, showing her Oscar nomination is not a fluke.But don't look for any romantic comedy element, which has become the trend of recent Hollywood movies.  In fact, this is a comedy you might have seen in the 80s, in which the characters get involved in troubles, and then realize the meaning of life, or something like that.  And as other reviewers rightly say, lots of clithe are thrown into the story, with stereotypes and caricatures that might offend some people.Steve Martin is a lawyer Peter Sanderson, which means in this kind of comedy, that he is working too much.  So he again cancels the trip to Hawaii with the kids, and his wife divorced him, considering that he is a hopeless case.But he has secret fun; he daily meets Charlene on the net, chatting joyfully with her, giving some free legal tips on this and that.  Then when the physical Charlene shows up at the door, well, you know, she turns out an ex-convict Peter least expected to see.  Of course, Queen Latifah's Charlene says she is innocent, being framed.  And we know from miles away that Peter is going to like her.  Not only him, but his kids soon come to like her, and even his partner Eugene Levy seems to have fallen in love with her.There is few things that are really surprising.  Even the grumpy matron Joan Plowright looks predictable.  (You should know the director is Adam Shankman of &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot;)  But that fact doesn't mean the film is bad.  Actually &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; is full of joy for those who love this kind of comedy based on incongruous pair of man and woman.  The story itself is as stale as last year's cookie, but the characters are certainly fun to see.The two leads are always great, plus you get a reliable support from Levy, who is as funny as the dad in &quot;American Pie.&quot;  Steve Martin's fans would see many of his irresistible trademark smiles, and don't miss the last sequence which alone can make up for any tedious moments.  Steve Martin, using some lingo of the boys in the hood, is dressed in hip-hop costume, and shows a bit of dancing.  Oh, so he can still go physical.Many gags are 'potentially offensive' -- for example, Steve Martin grabbing certain parts of Queen Latifah might not be a sihgt you want your kids to see.  And a spiritual song sung at dinner party is not to everybody's taste.

Levy and Latifah are great too.All this nonesense about the movie being racist is a bit nutty, after all Latifah is a co-producer, and you'd think that if she can see past the harmless jokes the viewers could do the same.The Farrelly Brothers take a similar approach in their movies in that they include characters who themselves disapprove of the jokes, so that your reaction as a viewer is represented by them. They diffuse the bomb for you so you can laugh. Well the idea in this movie is the same.The movie was overall harmless and enjoyable despite a few irritating moments (the girl-on-girl brawl with the dumb 80's &quot;Simply Irresistable&quot; tune was too long and unnecessary).I also wasn't blown away by the extras, though it was nice to see more shots of Martin dancing to HipHop in the outtakes. How many 58 year old white guys do you see doing that? All the interviews are the usual &quot;oh he's so great to work with&quot; or &quot;for such a young actor he's so professional&quot; crap.Anyway, above average fluff (carried by the performances of Martin, Latifah, and Levy).",3,A good Steve Martin vehicle,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,1209,"['fluff', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'usual', 'self', 'good', 'thing', 'fun', 'watch', 'Levy', 'Latifah', 'are', 'great', 'nonesense', 'movie', 'being', 'racist', 'bit', 'nutty', 'Latifah', 'co-producer', ""'d"", 'think', 'can', 'see', 'harmless', 'viewers', 'could', 'do', 'same.The', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'take', 'similar', 'approach', 'movies', 'include', 'characters', 'who', 'disapprove', 'jokes', 'reaction', 'viewer', 'represented', 'diffuse', 'bomb', 'can', 'laugh', 'Well', 'idea', 'movie', 'same.The', 'movie', 'was', 'overall', 'harmless', 'enjoyable', 'few', 'irritating', 'moments', 'girl-on-girl', 'brawl', 'dumb', '80', 'quot', 'Simply', 'Irresistable', 'quot', 'tune', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'unnecessary', '.I', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'blown', 'away', 'extras', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'shots', 'Martin', 'dancing', 'HipHop', 'outtakes', 'How', 'many', '58', 'year', 'old', 'white', 'guys', 'do', 'see', 'doing', 'interviews', 'are', 'usual', 'quot', 'so', 'great', 'work', 'quot', 'quot', 'young', 'actor', 'so', 'professional', 'quot', 'crap.Anyway', 'average', 'fluff', 'carried', 'performances', 'Martin', 'Latifah', 'Levy']",N/A

He ignores his kids, lost his wife, and basically has no social life.  After he sets up a blind internet date with what he hoped was a hot blonde to his horror he discovered that it was Queen Latifa who also wants some legal help.From there the laughs keep on continuing as Queen LAtifa follows Steve to these ritzy WHite people contry clubs, to his place of work and so on.  Meanwhile she also helps him get back into his kids life and discover that there is more to life than just work.This is a funny classic Steve Martin Comedy.

Steve Martin and John Candy; Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy...wait a second I see a trend here. Actually the former two comedic performers contrasted well with Martin's comedic style. Latifah also comes off well in what is, essentially, a buddy movie.Martin and Latifah meet through the modern day classifieds ; internet dating made remarkably difficult. Martin sees a picture with  Latifah in it and mistakes the attractive blond in the picture for Latifah (it's pretty easy to do once you see the photo). Clearly a match made in hell, Latifah and Martin immediately clash. The cliche about opposites attracting doesn't apply here. Martin's tax lawyer is straight laced and keeps a tight control on his emotions. Suddenly the focus is for Latifah to help Martin win back his ex-wife.Eugene Levy virtually steals this picture from the stars. Levy has always been an underappreciated performer and like most of the material he is in (whether it be trash or treasure), he always shines. His performance as a buddy of Martin's virtually blows the star off the screen. Part of the reason is Levy's innate talent the other reason is that Martin's character is underwritten and, really, not given much to do beyond reacting to his circumstances. In Martin's comedy classics The Jerk and Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, it's clear that he's best when he acts and reacts against other performances. He needs to get something started before he can use his comedic flair in reacting to it (he's second only to Kelsey Grammer in the comedic slow burn).The movie is enjoyable and there are many sequences that are fun. It just doesn't hold together as well as it should. Perhaps it's an example of marketing and packaging put before creativity.
