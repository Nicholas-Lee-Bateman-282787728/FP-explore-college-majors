1351749,A2V5AGMDQ7A5XM,B003L77GE2,adamKS,"[13, 16]","this is how you create a classic, clever comedy tv series. michael schurr and greg daniels had already done it with the office and got that show off and running but after they left (around season 5?) their new tv project ""parks and recreation"" started the same way the office had. . .a little rough and rocky with low ratings at the beginning and seemed somewhat of a carbon copy of the office. however, when a tv show has smart humor, excellent writing and loveable/unique/warm characters with depth, the show is going to get a cult following and continue to grow and become beloved. this season also did a great job of separating itself from the office while still obviously borrowing the humor.parks and recreation is unique in where most tv shows fail. either a show will go for cheap laughs and the raunchy sex humor like two and a half men or a show can stay classy and sophisticated and have character development and continous running stories between characters that arch over the entire season and you feel a real connection with the people and their situations...or you have the 30 minute sitcom where each episode basically starts from a clean slate which disables you from truly getting to know or connect to a character. fortunately, parks and rec picks the high road and stays classy while building on back stories and being absolutely hilarious.while i was sad to see mark brandaniwitz (paul schneider) character go last season, the addition of ben (adam scott) and chris (rob lowe) has been HUGE. i think they add alot to the show and i think rob lowe's health-freak of a character ""chris"" is just absolutely hilarious and adam scott's ""ben"" is awkwardly great and warm and those two characters add alot of laughs and quirkiness to an already great ensemble/cast.  i also like how leslie has came into her own in the season, she has gained more confidence and seems to be wiser than her oblivious nature in the first few seasons (good move to differentiate her from michael scott on the writers part). i also enjoyed the progression of rashida jones character ""ann"" in the season, she was always the ""stickler"" and uptight nurse in previous seasons, but in this season she lets loose and starts enjoying herself more and exploring the ""ann"" character.once again, character development is so essential to this shows success and this season continued that. i also love the unorthodox marriage and relationship of andy and april. puts a very modern twist on marriage however i did feel the ceremony was kind of disrespectful to the idea of a real marriage in general but it ended up being sweet and charming like the show is known for so that was a minor detail for me. very similiar to how pam and jim were the sails for the ship on the office in its first 4 seasons, andy and april are that for parks and rec, just in an even more unconventional way.i honestly cannot wait to get my hands on season 3 on dvd so i can watch all of these brilliant episodes again. like the office was in seasons 1-5, the show just continues to get better and i cannot wait to see what is in store for season 4.brilliant show!",5,it just keeps getting better. . .,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,3121,"['how', 'create', 'classic', 'clever', 'comedy', 'tv', 'series', 'michael', 'schurr', 'greg', 'daniels', 'had',

So many new classic episodes/moments. So much is right with this show that it's hard to know where to begin. Let's see we've got the successful intergration of Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott). Speaking of...there's another adorable relationship unfolding between Ben and Leslie. But my favorite as far as couples go is still April and Andy.  And if not for NBC's flub of accidentally promoting April and Andy's awesome sauce wedding they would have taken everyone by surprise with probably the most charming TV wedding I have ever seen. And what really is amazing is that they are more loveable/ interesting to watch as a married couple. From them being horrible housekeepers, to them eating turkey chili with a shared plastic fork off of a frisbee, to their role playing and contests of seeing who can get the most money from people at the Snakehole Lounge...there are so many things that have been funny, sweet and original about them.But there have been great moments with the other major characters as well: Ann and Leslie anger dancing in ""The Fight"". Ron swiveling his chair around his circular desk in a vain effort to avoid citizens in ""The Bubble"". The Return of Tammy 2. The Return of Jean-Ralphio. The Return of Detlef Schrempf. Tom seemingly becoming a budding mogul with Jean-Ralphio (their company's name is Entertainment 720). Which I hope means that we get to see more of Jean-Ralphio (""Flushed with Cash""). The ecstasy that was ""5000 Candles In The Wind"", and the potential agony that is Tammy 1 (Just the mention of her made Tammy 2 run for cover). And what's gonna happen with Leslie? Will she run for and/or become Mayor? Will she and Ben go public with their relationship? And after Ann being a party girl most of the season is she going to continue to ride the wildside with Donna or was that a gleam in Chris' eye and what does that mean to Ann? And will Jerry ever be recognized as the great artist he is by the rest of the Parks department? (""Shut up Jerry"") I guess we'll just have to find out next season...For the uninitiated you'll have to forgive me if my review seemed to be relevant to only those who have been watching the show. To you, I say you have all summer to catch up and see why most people think this show is great.
