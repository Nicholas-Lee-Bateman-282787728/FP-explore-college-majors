To the makers credit they scored personal interviews with Defeo family neighbors and close friends who give insight into the family and the events leading up to the murders along with rare family photographs not seen in almost 40 years.The Defeo murders were best summed up by attorney William Weber. "" This was the murder of a family, that could have been your neighbor or mine "" Granted there were problems in it but all families do. The best book written on the Defeo Murders was done in 1981 called "" High Hopes The Amityville Murders "". I cannot give this documentary more than 2 stars despite it's qualities because too much of the so called facts in it have been debunked by reliable sources and the Brigante and Defeo families long ago.",2,Blend of Truth and Fiction,1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,792,"['documentary', 'blend', 'truth', 'fiction', 'makers', 'credit', 'scored', 'personal', 'interviews', 'Defeo', 'family', 'neighbors', 'close', 'friends', 'who', 'give', 'insight', 'family', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'murders', 'rare', 'family', 'photographs', 'not', 'seen', 'almost', '40', 'years.The', 'Defeo', 'murders', 'were', 'best', 'summed', 'up', 'attorney', 'William', 'Weber.', 'was', 'murder', 'family', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'neighbor', 'mine', 'Granted', 'were', 'problems', 'families', 'do', 'best', 'book', 'written', 'Defeo', 'Murders', 'was', 'done', '1981', 'called', 'High', 'Amityville', 'Murders', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'documentary', 'more', '2', 'stars', 'qualities', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'called', 'facts', 'have', 'been', 'debunked', 'reliable', 'sources', 'Brigante', 'Defeo', 'families', 'long', 'ago']",Shattered Hopes: The True Story of the Amityville Murders - Part I From Horror To Homicide
1520421,ABGJAV24BYFYF,B006W2TYZM,Joan Napolitano,"[4, 4]","The question on this is how they got a name like Edward Asner to do the narration. That aside it was mostly stuff I already knew. The crime scene photos were terrible. I would have liked to see some kind of interview with DeFeo I'm assuming he's allowed to do interviews. The sound quality was extremely bad with the music very loud and the dialogue very dim (I have a speaker set up on my TV so sound it usually not a problem). It ended abruptly Part II is coming sometime I guess, but they gave no clue as to what was actually in Part II. At times the recreation was inadvertently funny; the beard on DeFeo was absolutely fake and horrible. Anyway, I wouldn't pay to see Part II but it if winds up on Prime for free I might watch.",3,Wasn't bad...wasn't real good either,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,732,"['question', 'how', 'got', 'name', 'Edward', 'Asner', 'do', 'narration', 'aside', 'was', 'mostly', 'stuff', 'already', 'knew', 'crime', 'scene', 'photos', 'were', 'terrible', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'kind', 'interview', 'DeFeo', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'allowed', 'do', 'interviews', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'extremely', 'bad', 'music', 'very', 'loud', 'dialogue', 'very', 'dim', 'have', 'speaker', 'set', 'up', 'TV', 'so', 'sound', 'usually', 'not', 'problem', 'ended', 'abruptly', 'Part', 'II', 'coming', 'sometime', 'guess', 'gave', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'Part', 'II', 'times', 'recreation', 'was', 'inadvertently', 'funny', 'beard', 'DeFeo', 'was', 'absolutely', 'fake', 'horrible', 'Anyway', 'would', ""n't"", 'pay', 'see', 'Part', 'II', 'up', 'Prime', 'free', 'might', 'watch']",Shattered Hopes: The True Story of the Amityville Murders - Part I From Horror To Homicide
