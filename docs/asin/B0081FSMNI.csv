1541218,A1X7K2E0H9T319,B0081FSMNI,A Customer,"[8, 12]","Detention is thus far the crowning achievement of filmmaker Joseph Kahn, having co-written, self-funded, and directed the genre-bending movie and after two long years of growing acclaim and indie screenings has finally scored a mass distributing deal, giving the work the attention it deserves. This is one crazy movie, and Kahn's work creating dozens of music videos is not even prelude to the knowing style he pulls off here. I mean it- he even made Dane Cook watchable.The story of the seniors of fictitious Grizzly Lake High, where every face has a story to tell, sometimes diving hip-thrustingly first into science-fantasy fervor. Utilizing a breakneck pace with a constantly twisting and turning plot full of threads ingeniously converging like Navajo code on cocaine, the narrative is at different times comedy and horror and social commentary while at all times maintaining a cuttingly distinct voice and perspective. Iconic stories from teen movies past such as the Breakfast Club and Back to the Future and Scream are homaged into the framework of Detention, but twisted together in ways less fart jokey than Not Another Teen Movie (which itself was genius from start to finish). With an excellent cast of primarily young actors and a soundtrack that maps out the last twenty years of popular culture like the most  hipster of geeks on a soapbox, Detention is a tornado that praises modern American aesthetics in the same breath as rightly condemning it.While rich in hyperactive humor and smarmy critique, the script never crosses too far into hollow parody grounds, but instead is grounded by subplots as myriad as a masked killer on the prowl and a time-traveling identity switcharoo and typical teenage malcontent. This is eulogy for our urban legends as much as our time-worn tropes of comedy and horror in the pop mainstream, a testament to the timeless freak-fest that is high school, and yet still including a massive amount of in-jokes and puns and red herrings and the other things that makes art reveal itself as more worthy our time than movie-length commercials for god knows what. This is Kahn and friends appreciating the past, but begging for a relief from that same past with all the vigor of a pep rally from Hell and NO MORE MARIJUANA.Some may say the ending is over the top, but I see it as a culmination of what was there all along, as well as a statement on how absurd real life is anyhow. The prolific producer of legal bubblegum smut Aaron Spelling once responded, when asked why he made so many television programs about and for essentially teens exclusively, something to the affect of how teens can live and die a thousand times in the span of a single day. Kahn hasn't made a movie for teens here, not by any stretch of the pineal gland. He's made something for those who survived that time without bringing guns to class, something for those old enough to know better than to take mainstream culture in general or Hollywood in particular, so effably serious.",5,genre-busting like it's going out of style,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,2997,"['Detention', 'thus', 'far', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'filmmaker', 'Joseph', 'Kahn', 'having', 'co-written', 'self-funded', 'directed', 'genre-bending', 'movie', 'two', 'long', 'years', 'growing', 'acclaim', 'indie', 'screenings', 'finally', 'scored', 'mass', 'distributing', 'deal', 'giving', 'work', 'attention', 'one', 'crazy', 'movie', 'Kahn', 'work', 'creating', 'dozens', 'music', 'videos', 'not', 'even', 'prelude', 'knowing', 'style', 'here', 'mean', 'it-', 'even', 'made', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'watchable.The', 'story', 'seniors', 'fictitious', 'Grizzly', 'Lake', 'High', 'where', 'face', 'story', 'tell', 'sometimes', 'diving', 'hip-thrustingly', 'first', 'science-fantasy', 'fervor', 'Utilizing', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'constantly', 'twisting', 'turning', 'plot', 'full', 'threads', 'ingeniously', 'converging', 'Navajo', 'code', 'cocaine', 'narrative', 'different', 'times', 'comedy', 'horror', 'social', 'commentary', 'times', 'maintaining', 'cuttingly', 'distinct', 'voice', 'perspective', 'Iconic', 'stories', 'teen', 'movies', 'past', 'such', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Back', 'Future', 'Scream', 'are', 'homaged', 'framework', 'Detention', 'twisted', 'together', 'ways', 'fart', 'jokey', 'Not', 'Teen', 'Movie', 'was', 'genius', 'start', 'finish', 'excellent', 'cast', 'primarily', 'young', 'actors', 'soundtrack', 'out', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'popular', 'culture', 'most', 'hipster', 'geeks', 'soapbox', 'Detention', 'tornado', 'modern', 'American', 'aesthetics', 'same', 'breath', 'rightly', 'condemning', 'it.While', 'rich', 'hyperactive', 'humor', 'smarmy', 'critique', 'script', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'hollow', 'parody', 'grounds', 'instead', 'grounded', 'subplots', 'as', 'myriad', 'masked', 'killer', 'prowl', 'time-traveling', 'identity', 'switcharoo', 'typical', 'teenage', 'malcontent', 'eulogy', 'urban', 'as', 'much', 'time-worn', 'tropes', 'comedy', 'horror', 'pop', 'mainstream', 'testament', 'timeless', 'freak-fest', 'high', 'school', 'yet', 'still', 'including', 'massive', 'amount', 'in-jokes', 'puns', 'red', 'herrings', 'other', 'things', 'art', 'reveal', 'more', 'worthy', 'time', 'movie-length', 'commercials', 'god', 'what', 'Kahn', 'friends', 'appreciating', 'past', 'begging', 'relief', 'same', 'past', 'vigor', 'pep', 'rally', 'Hell', 'NO', 'MORE', 'MARIJUANA.Some', 'may', 'say', 'ending', 'top', 'see', 'culmination', 'what', 'was', 'all', 'along', 'as', 'well', 'statement', 'how', 'absurd', 'real', 'life', 'anyhow', 'prolific', 'producer', 'legal', 'bubblegum', 'smut', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'once', 'responded', 'when', 'asked', 'why', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'television', 'programs', 'essentially', 'exclusively', 'something', 'affect', 'how', 'teens', 'can', 'live', 'die', 'thousand', 'times', 'span', 'single', 'day', 'Kahn', ""n't"", 'made', 'movie', 'teens', 'here', 'not', 'stretch', 'pineal', 'gland', 'made', 'something', 'who', 'survived', 'time', 'bringing', 'guns', 'class', 'something', 'old', 'enough', 'know', 'better', 'take', 'mainstream', 'culture', 'general', 'Hollywood', 'particular', 'so', 'effably', 'serious']",N/A

Someone dressed up as ""Cinderhella"" from a horror movie franchise is killing kids from Grizzly Lake High School. Meanwhile some smaller dramas with some of the students play out. Riley Jones and Clapton Davis have been good friends since forever. She's a bit peeved because he wants to go to the prom with Ione who is vapid beyond the meaning of the word. Meanwhile, Billy Nolan, who is part fly, (yes, you read that right) wants to beat up Clapton because he also wants to go to the prom with Ione. Oh, and there is a time machine inside the stuffed bear in the school hall.This is a fast, wild ride. The dialogue is replete with now and wow padder. There are a lot of clever pop culture references from both 'now' and the 90s and they come at you relentlessly. The story isn't quite as involved as it might seem at first glance because the pace throws you off. Once you settle into that the viewing gets a bit easier. There are, though, a couple of bizarre zingers (one late in the third act) that are so far out of left field, you might just be thinking WTF!?The principle actors, Josh Hutcherson, Shanley Caswell, Spencer Locke, et al, do a decent job. The production values are as good as they need to be to get this done. What's really happening here is the script. Writer/director Joseph Kahn's previous work has been entirely in music videos which is probably why he felt the need to cram so much into each moving minute. But, as I said earlier, you really need to pay attention. A 'time slip' element enters the plot in the third act and, if you blink, you'll be lost.I liked this a lot.

And so it was, on a rather different scale than Joss Whedon.  Whedon is a humanist, whereas I get the picture that Joseph Kahn, who directed this highly entertaining horror comedy, is no such thing, despite the sentimental flourishes with which his movie concludes (sappy voice over that says, basically, ""but underneath it all we're just people, and we all need love."")Kahn made two epic videos with the pop singer slash actress Kylie Minogue.  In one, the charity single by ""Helping Haiti,"" he blended shocking real-life footage of hurricane devastation in Haiti, with hideous footage or pop stars from Rod Stewart to Westlife and beyond, all lip synching the old R.E.M. classic ""Everybody Hurts.""  For Kylie's 11th solo album, APHRODITE, Kahn turned the first single, ""All the Lovers"" into a giant orgy of models, male and female, stripping to pristine white underwear in the middle of downtown LA in front of the Gehry Disney Concert Hall, to worship a giant goddess Kylie.  Made in the immediate aftermath of DETENTION, you can see Kahn trying to work out ideas he didn't manage to articulate during its filming.  Josh Hutcherson, the executive producer of the film, plays the hero part, but he's sort of a sad sack, and he's named after a pair of heritage rock artists (in joke?)  In general the acting's not great in DETENTION, but who cares?  In CABIN IN THE WOODS, the whole movie slides by on the Whedonesque charm of the actors and the witty dialogue, and here the dialogue and the acting is just one jab after another, like an attack of fire ants.  If like me you thought of abandoning Detention before the second murder, my advice is, keep up with it if you can, because you will be amply rewarded throughout.  The characters start making sense, they become sort of lovable, even the awful ones and though I never did figure out why the boy had to wear a TV on his wrist growing up, I enjoyed myself immensely and, if this is the future of cinema, it's in safe hands.",5,See it early and often,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,2440,"['watched', 'picture', 'critic', 'Steve', 'Shaviro', 'who', 'said', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'represented', 'future', 'horror', 'wait', 'maybe', 'future', 'cinema', 'grand', 'claim', 'exactly', 'kind', 'have', 'hankering', 'enjoyed', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'helluva', 'lot', 'went', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'sorts', 'movies', 'kind', 'like', 'rip', 'genre', 'so', 'many', 'jungle', 'fronds', 'machete', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'different', 'scale', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Whedon', 'humanist', 'whereas', 'get', 'picture', 'Joseph', 'Kahn', 'who', 'directed', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'horror', 'comedy', 'such', 'thing', 'sentimental', 'flourishes', 'movie', 'concludes', 'sappy', 'voice', 'basically', ""'re"", 'just', 'people', 'need', 'love', 'Kahn', 'made', 'two', 'epic', 'pop', 'singer', 'slash', 'actress', 'Kylie', 'Minogue', 'one', 'charity', 'single', 'Helping', 'Haiti', 'blended', 'shocking', 'real-life', 'footage', 'hurricane', 'devastation', 'Haiti', 'hideous', 'footage', 'pop', 'stars', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'Westlife', 'lip', 'synching', 'old', 'R.E.M', 'classic', 'Everybody', 'Kylie', '11th', 'solo', 'album', 'APHRODITE', 'Kahn', 'turned', 'first', 'single', 'Lovers', 'giant', 'orgy', 'models', 'male', 'female', 'stripping', 'pristine', 'white', 'underwear', 'middle', 'downtown', 'LA', 'front', 'Gehry', 'Disney', 'Concert', 'Hall', 'worship', 'giant', 'goddess', 'Kylie', 'Made', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'DETENTION', 'can', 'see', 'Kahn', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'ideas', 'did', ""n't"", 'manage', 'articulate', 'filming', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'executive', 'producer', 'film', 'hero', 'part', 'sort', 'sad', 'sack', 'named', 'pair', 'heritage', 'rock', 'artists', 'joke', 'general', 'acting', 'not', 'great', 'DETENTION', 'who', 'CABIN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'whole', 'movie', 'slides', 'Whedonesque', 'charm', 'actors', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'here', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'just', 'one', 'jab', 'attack', 'fire', 'ants', 'thought', 'abandoning', 'Detention', 'second', 'murder', 'advice', 'keep', 'up', 'can', 'will', 'be', 'amply', 'rewarded', 'characters', 'start', 'making', 'sense', 'become', 'sort', 'lovable', 'even', 'awful', 'ones', 'never', 'did', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'boy', 'had', 'wear', 'TV', 'wrist', 'growing', 'up', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'future', 'cinema', 'safe', 'hands']",N/A
1541239,A3TMS14RL9Q0R1,B0081FSMNI,"K. Sommerfield ""Slasher Studios""","[3, 6]","The phrase ""love it or hate it"" is overused when it comes to describing films in general. The term is too often applied without much care and is a way to separate oneself from the masses. Earlier this year ""Cabin in the Woods"" was released to many raves but I was less than impressed. Nevertheless, I couldn't use the phrase ""love it or hate it"" because while I admired the artistry behind the film, I just didn't care for the execution. It wasn't a terrible film by any means and I understand why fans went crazy for it, it just didn't work for me. Now we have a film that I WILL use the ""love it or hate it"" phrase because nothing else can possibly describe it. The film in question? ""Detention"", the direct-to-dvd release (select theaters doesn't work when it comes to horror) from Sony that, in my eyes, is the film that ""Cabin in the Woods"" SHOULD have been. Are you ready for the madness? Let's dig in.The film opens with uberbitch Taylor Fisher, the most popular girl in Grizzly Lake, waking up and telling the audience how to be cool while screaming obscenities at her family. As she is about to leave for school, she is brutally murdered by someone dressed as Cinderhella, a horror film serial killer in the movie within a movie.We shift attention to Riley Jones, a smart, rebel loner, who arrives at school where the audience is introduced to Clapton Davis, a ""slacker hipster"" liked by virtually everyone of which Riley has a crush on, Ione Foster (shades of ""Say Anything""), the cheerleader former best friend of Riley and current girlfriend of Clapton, Sander Sanderson, Clapton's best friend who openly makes attempts to have sex with Riley, and Billy Nolan, the school jock who is still obsessed with Ione.Sound confusing? Don't worry, it's part of the fun. Wouldn't you know it, Billy challenges Clapton to a fight after school for the right to date Ione. Since Taylor is absent (due to umm...being murdered and all), Ione is assigned as head cheerleader and Riley as the school mascot for the upcoming football game. As Riley attempts to hang herself in front of the school's stuffed grizzly bear, she is attacked by Cinderhella. While Billy and Clapton's fight is about to start, the police arrive to inform the students of Taylor's murder. Barely escaping her attack, Riley tries to inform the police, but they do not believe her. At home, Riley is again attacked and manages to escape by running through backyards. The police arrive but still remain skeptical due to the similarities of her attacker and that of the film. When the group of teens show up for a drunken sex party and Billy is killed by the Cinderhella wannabe, the teens are forced to serve Detention to find out who the killer is among them.Wow..that was exhausting. Did I mention the guy with the tv for a hand, the time traveling bear, the mother and daughter that switch bodies, the UFOs, the meteor, or the parallel time lines? It's all here in one of the strangest movies that you will see all year. A test to see if you will like this film, when a confrontation gets ugly a reply to the bully is, ""Sorry, I gotta go. Hotel for Dogs is on cable."" Make you laugh or smile a little? Well then, ""Detention"" is the movie for you. Loaded with gore, strong performances by a more than capable cast, one kicking soundtrack, and more pop cultural references than you can shake a stick at...""Detention"" is ""Scream"" meets ""Scott Pilgram"" with a dash or two of ""Kaboom?""

1541242,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0081FSMNI,Mark Turner,"[6, 7]","Ever since Mel Brooks first began making fun of movie genres it seems that form of comedy has taken hold. What started out hilarious though ended up becoming stale and some truly bad examples were made (think of the movies made by the group behind EPIC MOVIE). Rare gems came out like SCARY MOVIE that then slacked off as well. So when a parody of a genre comes out that offers something original and whacky, I'm ready to give it a watch. With DETENTION I'm glad I did.The movie begins with a form that hasn't been used before that works well here. The characters now and then talk to the fourth wall, the audience, and guide them through things happening in the film. It opens with the most popular girl in school (and of course the bitchiest) telling us all about her high school and the kids there while she gets ready for her day. This is one of those girls seen on SWEET 16 who complains about not getting the correct car on her birthday. She mentions the release of a new horror film with a killer known as Cinderhella who then promptly shows up and dispatches of our narrator setting the stage for the killer on the lose.The kids at school of course do nothing but talk about her death as we introduce them here. Riley is the odd girl out, the different girl who talks about being a vegetarian and supports other groups yet isn't on the popular list of school kids. Her best friend Taylor is though. Taylor's boyfriend (the guy Riley wanted to ask out) Clapton Davis is a neer do well teen complete with skateboard and loved by all...except the school jock who wants to do nothing more than pound Clapton into the ground.As the film progresses we get glimpses of the killer here and there, several in failed attempts on the lives of our main characters. We also get tons of laughter inspiring moments that are too many to count and too fast to catalog. Yes, this film moves at a frighteningly fast pace but not so much that it can't be enjoyed. And the film doesn't leave itself in the horror genre alone, skipping along occasionally into sci fi alien invasion or time travel storylines that tie into the main one as well.When the group finally makes it to their actual detention during the high school prom, things happen that are completely off the wall and absurd. And yet it totally works. A killer in the room with them and they never see the murder happen? A student who's been in detention for decades and yet never ages? The reveal of how it all began years ago? Yep, it works here.There really isn't a true category to place this film in. It's more original than most and offers so much at that rapid pace that you might find yourself clutching the remote so you can pause to finish laughing while the next joke or set up is being offered. I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but was pleasantly surprised as it played out. I was left wanting more and finding myself hoping that those behind it are given a bigger budget and the chance to make more movies.

It could be that Shaw has changed her name to Caswell but nobody is saying.Spencer Locke is allowed to carry her Bitsy characterization to new levels and is really good in this,  or maybe it is just that she is the most effortlessly erotic actress in history and I can't be remotely objective.  Whatever, she is the main reason to watch and you will most likely spend a lot of the viewing wishing she had more screen time and that there were more extreme close-ups of her expressive face.You hate to say innovative about something this derivative,  but it is a fair assessment of ""Detention"".  From the ""Girls Just Want to have Fun"" opening sequence (the same 1985 spoiled girl bedroom scene - here Alison Woods channels Holly Gagnier) to the ""Breakfast Club"" (1985) detention to the ""Freaky Friday"" ""Back to the Future"" plot devices;  this is a teen movie tribute without the obvious title of ""Not Another Teen Movie 2"".  Unfortunately scotch taping this stuff together without a higher wattage script means that the whole is a lot less than the sum of its parts.""Detention"" would greatly benefit from having actual humor in place of its endless failed attempts at humor, although at least the continually failed humor provides a kind of unity to the film. Forty-something directors writing dialog for teenagers is generally a bad idea, Joseph Kahn grew up in the 80's and his homages are lost on most target audience viewers.  This disconnect can occasionally work in films,  when it fuses into a Coan Brothers style poke at movie conventions; but that requires a movie where the absurdity is subtle and not one where the audience is repeatedly bludgeoned with the absurdity sledgehammer.  ""Detention"" constantly seeks your attention, like a psychedelic one-trick pony mad for a carrot.  If it had been made two years later it could serve as a posthumous tribute to Tony Scott, the master of ignoring any reality checks when moving his self-delusions to the screen.On the other hand you have to admire a film that makes absolutely no effort to connect with its target audience (if it actually had a pre-production target audience), that doesn't happen often because feature films are supposed to have at least a faint hope of a financial payback.It does have a fun commentary featuring most of the cast and crew.  You won't miss much by simply watching it the first time with the commentary on and that will save you from a life wasting second viewing.Then again, what do I know?

It begins with a high school girl lying in bed and breaking the fourth wall, espousing on her rules of existing as a high school hottie, with her rules being written on the screen a la Zombieland.  She is quickly (and thankfully) eviscerated by a surprising original and creepy-looking killer, modeled off of a fictitious horror show (a la Scream/Stab) called Cinderhella and its sequel.  The movie proper begins, this time with our lower-class, French-fry -in-bed-eating loser protagonist who also breaks the fourth wall (this happens a lot).  As Detention then introduces our unlikely protagonists who talk as if they wanted to be in a Kevin Smith film and dissect the horror movie they are in, all the while getting confused whether the murderer is replicating Cinderhella or Scream.  I think that's when they introduce the time-traveling stuffed bear.  I don't know.  I was on Ambien the first time I watched it.Why is it called Detention?  Well, about an hour into the film (approximately 30 minutes from the end), they end up in (Breakfast Club alert!) Saturday Detention during their prom because the principal (Dane Cook) believes that since they were near one of the people who was killed (who apparently has fly blood (The Fly) and lived for the first 13ish years of his life with his hand in a TV...I can't make this stuff up) one of them is obviously the killer so let's all get together for Detention instead of going to prom.  From there, time travel, body-swapping, end-of-the-world (Donnie Darko) shenanigans all come to play that I forgot I was watching a movie supposedly about a slasher-killer.Honestly, I don't really know what to say about Detention.  I did laugh periodically throughout and I appreciated some of what director Joseph Kahn was aiming for.  He takes shots at music video directors thinking they can be feature film directors (i.e., him) and the movie Torque (also by him) and continues the trend set up in Scream 4 in dissecting not only modern day horror but also the Twitter/Facebook/YouTube nature of pop culture today.  At one point, the Detentionees find footage of upcoming Cinderhella 3 and, much like the much superior opening to Scream 4, it is a movie inside a movie inside a movie, all wrapped around being in Saturday detention.  But when something takes a kitchen sink approach to filmmaking, it can either be absolutely enthralling and entertaining (see: American Horror Story) or needlessly exhausting (see: Detention).  I think it was around the moment of the mother/daughter body/time-swapping that my eyes glazed over.
