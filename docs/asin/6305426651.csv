It has everything--adventure, suspense, romance, comedy, tragedy--all extremely well done by a man whose tender spirit shines through every moment.The best scene in the film for me is when Guido's love interest (who becomes his wife in the film and really IS his wife off camera), ducks under her table to see Guido, the waiter. When she asks him to ""take me away,"" oh my Lord, nothing in the history of film gets any better than that sweet moment.""Life is Beautiful"" is aptly titled. It is a testament to the beauty of the human spirit.

463501,AK6UVFSU07NXH,6305426651,Anthony Hinde,"[1, 1]","Few people believed it would be possible to make a comedy set in the Nazi concentration camps of WWII. But in Life is Beautiful (aka: La Vita &egrave; bella), Roberto Benigni had a vision of one possible way to tell this tale  of horror without dehumanising the lead characters. In fact, the whole film  is full of contradictions and surprises.There are two clear  stages in the film. The first half concentrates on Guido Orefice's efforts  to woo his chosen lady. He is funny, courageous and irrepressible in his  attempts to win the heart and hand of the lovely Dora.  Cunning strategies  are used, that take advantage of all the quirks of Florence and its people  to impress the woman he constantly greets with, &quot;Buono giorno  Principessa&quot;, (Good day Princess).From early on, there is an  undercurrent of anti-Semitism that casts a cloud over our anticipation of  things to come. But for Guido, racism is simply another of life's  obstacles; all he does is dodge around them in his pursuit of life. Pre-war  Italy still manages to seem magical through his eyes and his attitude  becomes infectious. We soon come to believe, along with Guido, that  anything is possible and if you assume the best will happen, it probably  will.Dora's situation does not start out quite as rosy. She is  betrothed to a boorish man who takes her for granted and seems more  interested in his political status than in her happiness. Luckily, Guido  has set his sights on making her life as interesting as possible. And that  allows the audience the pleasure of rooting for the underdog; a  semi-employed Jewish waiter with one sadly misshapen hat. Although she  doesn't see a way out at first, we all know that Guido's optimism will  eventually triumph over his straight-laced and  narcissistic competitor.Soon, the two star crossed lovers are married and joined by a  precocious son by the name of Giosu&eacute;, played superbly by the young actor,  Giorgio Cantarini. He clearly takes after his father and is the apple of  his parents' eyes. It would take a hard-hearted person to avoid loving this  little angle; an angel who will go to any extreme to avoid his bath time.  His other main concern seems to be getting enough time to play with his toy  tank.But love and optimism are unable to hold back the tide of  history. Italy soon falls in with Germany and begins persecuting their  Jewish population. On Giosu&eacute;'s forth birthday, while his mother is out,  soldiers take he and his father. They are bundled into a truck and then a  train, headed for the concentration camps. As soon as Dora realises what  has happened, she follows them into the depths of hell.Guido has  other problems to occupy him. Although he doesn't know exactly what is  going to happen, he knows enough to want to shield his son in the only way  he can. While they are in the truck he concocts a story to convince Giosu&eacute;  that they are taking a surprise trip to celebrate his birthday. As their  situation worsens, the fiction becomes more convoluted. Guido controls  every aspect of his son's perception to convince him they are participating  in a most challenging competition, with a full sized tank as the prize.Despite the horror of the situation, death all around, brutal  labour,  starvation and dehumanising barracks, Guido focuses all his  efforts on the happiness of his son. Not only does he succeed in protecting  the young boy's fragile soul but it is clear he manages to distract himself  as well. Guido epitomises selflessness. In the brief moments when he is not  labouring for the Nazis or entertaining his son, he finds small ways to  remind Dora that he loves her. I can't think of any more poignant moments  in cinema.In the end, Guido manages to accomplish what he had set  out to do; protect his son.

At once hilarious and heartwarming, and haunting and disturbing, director and star Roberto Benigni creates not just one of the finest Holocaust films of all time, but one of the saddest, happiest, heartwarming, brilliant, and truly, truly beautiful movies ever made.This is not your typical Hollywoodized cheesy melodramatic soap opera. No emotion feels saccharine or cheesy, no tear is not earned, and no joyous moment not truly thrilling. This is the touching story of a man who loved his child so much he would try to shield him from unspeakable characters if it meant his life. La Vita &egrave; Bella (Italian name) will take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions; from gut-bursting laughing, to joy, to sorrow, to sickening horror, disbelief, and joy again.If there is one thing that La Vita &egrave; Bella has to tell us, it is that Life, truly IS, beautiful. Light can triumph over darkness and there is hope even in despair. I urge you to watch this incredible film, which is both one of my favourites, and one of the greatest films ever made.

463504,A62G4QX6XQVLP,6305426651,Anyechka,"[6, 11]","The first half of this film was a fun lighthearted sweet romantic comedy, which really contrasts with the second half, which despite having some funny moments, is very serious and depressing in tone, almost as though it were an entirely different movie.  The second half of the movie gives me mixed feelings; I believe Benigni's heart was in the right place when he made this movie, but by and large the second half is so unrealistic and even tasteless in parts that it insults what really happened.  I was even sick to my stomach when Guido was making light of how Giosue had told him that he'd heard that people were being made into soap and buttons and being burnt in ovens, joking about washing himself and buttoning up with their friends in the Barracks and how the ovens weren't burning people fast enough, trying to make him see how ""ridiculous"" it was to believe such things.  And what camp are they supposed to be in that has such horrible security and where a child not only goes ungassed on arrival but also undetected the entire time he's there?  There were instances where underage inmates or invalids who had been smuggled out of the hospital were able to be hidden for a time, but before long nearly all of them were found out, and the person or people hiding them were likely killed also.  The voiceover at the end suggests that this is a true story, though I have a hard time believing that.I can accept that some things had to be modified for practical purposes while still conveying the truth of what happened; for example, not stuffing the cattle car with as many people as the Nazis really stuffed into them, or the actors playing the inmates not dropping down to 40 pounds each, but what remains is still unrealistic (albeit well-meaningly so).  People aren't greeted with screams, kicks, beatings, slaps, curses, and barking dogs when they unboard the cars (in a very orderly way!), their heads aren't shaved, the portions are too large and healthy-looking, there is no Kapo or other sadistic prisoner put in charge of the inmates in the Barracks, no searchlights till the very end, an incredibly unrealistic evacuation of the camp, too many prisoners alive (and healthy-looking) at the end on the death march that is liberated, and no security.  We know this camp has a gas chamber, so it can't be one of the milder camps like Westerbork where families could be together and children were allowed to live, yet if it had been one of those types of camps, the child wouldn't have had to be hidden either.  This camp has so little security it's like a revolt and escape waiting to happen!  And where is the delousing process that greeted the prisoners lucky enough to live (during which Giosue would certainly have been detected), where they had to undress, got their heads shaved, were driven into an icy-cold shower, were thrown raggy prisoner rags, and had to pick a pair of shoes, no matter how ill-fitting or mismatched, from a mammoth pile of them?If this were a real Vernichtungslager, the child would have had no doubts about what kind of place they really were in.  The few children selected to live (for medical experimentation or sexual exploitation primarily) didn't have any doubts about where they were or what was happening to them.  In a real extermination camp, the Kapo or whomever was put in charge of each Block rounded up the people trying to escape going off to work each day and beat them.  That child would have been detected during one of these searches to see if anyone were hiding in there and trying to avoid labour.  The Nazis were constantly counting the prisoners and searching the Barracks and other buildings to make sure everyone was accounted for and that no one was trying to hide!Overall it was a very sweet movie about a father's love for his son (and in the first half how he won the heart of the boy's mother), but unfortunately the inaccuracies in the second half spoilt some of my enjoyment of this movie.  And as well-meaning as the people who produced this movie may very well have been, it unfortunately will be fodder for the historical revisionists, who will point to it as ""proof"" that the Shoah really wasn't all that bad.",4,Mixed feelings about this,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,4192,"['first', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'fun', 'lighthearted', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'really', 'second', 'half', 'having', 'funny', 'moments', 'very', 'serious', 'depressing', 'tone', 'almost', 'were', 'entirely', 'different', 'movie', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'believe', 'Benigni', 'heart', 'was', 'right', 'place', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'large', 'second', 'half', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'even', 'tasteless', 'parts', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'was', 'even', 'sick', 'stomach', 'when', 'Guido', 'was', 'making', 'light', 'how', 'Giosue', 'had', 'told', ""'d"", 'heard', 'people', 'were', 'being', 'made', 'soap', 'buttons', 'being', 'burnt', 'ovens', 'joking', 'washing', 'buttoning', 'up', 'friends', 'Barracks', 'how', 'ovens', 'were', ""n't"", 'burning', 'people', 'fast', 'enough', 'trying', 'make', 'see', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'believe', 'such', 'things', 'what', 'camp', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'such', 'horrible', 'security', 'where', 'child', 'not', 'only', 'ungassed', 'arrival', 'also', 'undetected', 'entire', 'time', 'there', 'were', 'instances', 'where', 'underage', 'invalids', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'smuggled', 'hospital', 'were', 'able', 'be', 'hidden', 'time', 'long', 'nearly', 'were', 'found', 'out', 'person', 'people', 'hiding', 'were', 'likely', 'killed', 'also', 'voiceover', 'end', 'true', 'story', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'that.I', 'can', 'accept', 'things', 'had', 'be', 'modified', 'practical', 'purposes', 'still', 'conveying', 'truth', 'what', 'happened', 'example', 'not', 'stuffing', 'cattle', 'car', 'as', 'many', 'people', 'Nazis', 'really', 'stuffed', 'actors', 'playing', 'inmates', 'not', 'dropping', 'down', '40', 'pounds', 'what', 'still', 'unrealistic', 'well-meaningly', 'so', 'People', 'are', ""n't"", 'greeted', 'screams', 'kicks', 'beatings', 'slaps', 'curses', 'barking', 'dogs', 'when', 'unboard', 'cars', 'very', 'orderly', 'way', 'heads', 'are', ""n't"", 'shaved', 'portions', 'are', 'too', 'large', 'healthy-looking', 'Kapo', 'other', 'sadistic', 'prisoner', 'put', 'charge', 'inmates', 'Barracks', 'searchlights', 'till', 'very', 'end', 'incredibly', 'unrealistic', 'evacuation', 'camp', 'too', 'many', 'prisoners', 'alive', 'healthy-looking', 'end', 'death', 'march', 'liberated', 'security', 'know', 'camp', 'gas', 'chamber', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'milder', 'camps', 'Westerbork', 'where', 'families', 'could', 'be', 'together', 'children', 'were', 'allowed', 'live', 'yet', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'types', 'camps', 'child', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'be', 'hidden', 'camp', 'so', 'little', 'security', 'revolt', 'escape', 'waiting', 'happen', 'where', 'delousing', 'process', 'greeted', 'prisoners', 'lucky', 'enough', 'live', 'Giosue', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'detected', 'where', 'had', 'undress', 'got', 'heads', 'shaved', 'were', 'driven', 'icy-cold', 'shower', 'were', 'thrown', 'raggy', 'prisoner', 'rags', 'had', 'pick', 'pair', 'shoes', 'matter', 'how', 'ill-fitting', 'mismatched', 'mammoth', 'pile', 'were', 'real', 'Vernichtungslager', 'child', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'doubts', 'what', 'kind', 'place', 'really', 'were', 'few', 'children', 'selected', 'live', 'medical', 'experimentation', 'sexual', 'exploitation', 'primarily', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'doubts', 'where', 'were', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'real', 'extermination', 'camp', 'Kapo', 'was', 'put', 'charge', 'Block', 'rounded', 'up', 'people', 'trying', 'escape', 'going', 'work', 'day', 'beat', 'child', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'detected', 'one', 'searches', 'see', 'anyone', 'were', 'hiding', 'trying', 'avoid', 'labour', 'Nazis', 'were', 'constantly', 'counting', 'prisoners', 'searching', 'Barracks', 'other', 'buildings', 'make', 'sure', 'everyone', 'was', 'accounted', 'one', 'was', 'trying', 'hide', 'Overall', 'was', 'very', 'sweet', 'movie', 'father', 'love', 'son', 'first', 'half', 'how', 'won', 'heart', 'boy', 'mother', 'unfortunately', 'inaccuracies', 'second', 'half', 'spoilt', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'as', 'well-meaning', 'people', 'who', 'produced', 'movie', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'unfortunately', 'will', 'be', 'fodder', 'historical', 'revisionists', 'who', 'will', 'point', 'proof', 'Shoah', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

463507,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6305426651,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 2/13Rate: 82/13: Why Life Is Beautiful is a memorable film is because of what Roberto Benigni did during the 1999 Oscars show. I did see it live on television when it happened, but since then, I had never seen the film until now. I think the reason why for that is that I am not particularly keen about the prospect of being trapped through a very slow Italian picture which is very common. So, I decided to watch it and swallow the pace. For about probably half of the film, I think that I realized my misfortune because it was too loquacious and unfunny. Then, like how it happened in Vertigo, things start to change, and a perspective begins to develop as the characters enter the phase of undergoing through the Holocaust. After seeing what had transpired between the father and the son about making the Holocaust a game to be played, I wasn't sure if I should be offended or say, ""Well, that's an interesting point of view."" To make the Holocaust a positive experience for the sake of shielding the son's eyes from the horrors in order to mitigate the effects of the inevitable psychological trauma that would soon follow after liberation is what makes Life Is Beautiful a compelling film to watch.

There are happy and magical moments scattered throughout this Italian masterpiece, but it is Benigni's handling of the holocaust that gives this film substance.You often hear this foreign film described as powerful and moving but upon viewing it for the first time you may wonder what all the fuss is about, until you reach the end and finally feel the impact of what Benigni has been trying to say.The film opens in Arezzo, Italy, in 1939, Benigni and his pal just a couple of happy-go-lucky Italian guys looking to make a place for themselves. Benigni wants to open a book store but will end up waiting tables instead while he charms his princess in spite of her imminent engagement. Benigni's lovely wife Nicoletta Braschi plays the girl of his dreams and falls for him because he makes her laugh. Their romance is tender and funny, with a touch of the sweet flavor of an Italian bread.A few years down the road, now with a book store and a young son, their lives begin to be intruded upon as anti-Semitism reaches its zenith. When his princess arrives home one day, she finds them missing, taken by soldiers. Hunting them down she forces a soldier to allow her to share in their fate, whatever that may be, and boards the train for the camps as well.Benigni makes the conscious decision to shield his son from the evil around him and save his innocence, convincing him it is all a game, the grand prize a real tank; something his son can not resist. Separated from his wife in the camp he finds clever ways to let her know he loves her, resulting in some truly touching scenes.But the real question is whether Benigni can keep up this high wire balancing act long enough to save his son's life and his innocence. The fact that Benigni keeps off screen the horror of the Holocaust makes the ending more powerful, as we have seen everything through the eyes of his son, yet we know the truth his son does not. The final shot is joyous yet poignant, leaving us suddenly angry, moved by what we have seen in unexpected ways.This film is shown quite often in schools, and Disney has released this special edition for that purpose, with elements which will add to the discussion about this most important part of history, at an affordable price for teachers and schools. The power of this film is derived from the joy of living Benigni instills in it. This is a magnificent film probably not appreciated as much as it should be but a film that stands as a moving testament to all those who did not get to continue the joy of living. No film library or school is complete without this foreign film masterpiece.",5,The Joy of Life,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,2711,"['Life', 'Beautiful', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'made', 'warm', 'romantic', 'film', 'filled', 'joy', 'living', 'are', 'happy', 'magical', 'moments', 'scattered', 'Italian', 'masterpiece', 'Benigni', 'handling', 'holocaust', 'film', 'substance.You', 'often', 'hear', 'foreign', 'film', 'described', 'powerful', 'moving', 'viewing', 'first', 'time', 'may', 'wonder', 'what', 'fuss', 'reach', 'end', 'finally', 'feel', 'impact', 'what', 'Benigni', 'been', 'trying', 'say.The', 'film', 'opens', 'Arezzo', 'Italy', '1939', 'Benigni', 'pal', 'just', 'couple', 'happy-go-lucky', 'Italian', 'guys', 'looking', 'make', 'place', 'Benigni', 'open', 'book', 'store', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'waiting', 'tables', 'instead', 'princess', 'spite', 'imminent', 'engagement', 'Benigni', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Nicoletta', 'Braschi', 'girl', 'dreams', 'falls', 'laugh', 'romance', 'tender', 'funny', 'touch', 'sweet', 'flavor', 'Italian', 'bread.A', 'few', 'years', 'road', 'now', 'book', 'store', 'young', 'son', 'lives', 'begin', 'be', 'intruded', 'anti-Semitism', 'zenith', 'When', 'princess', 'home', 'one', 'day', 'missing', 'taken', 'soldiers', 'Hunting', 'down', 'soldier', 'allow', 'share', 'fate', 'may', 'be', 'boards', 'train', 'camps', 'well.Benigni', 'conscious', 'decision', 'shield', 'son', 'evil', 'save', 'innocence', 'convincing', 'game', 'grand', 'prize', 'real', 'tank', 'something', 'son', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'Separated', 'wife', 'camp', 'clever', 'ways', 'let', 'know', 'resulting', 'truly', 'touching', 'scenes.But', 'real', 'question', 'Benigni', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'high', 'wire', 'balancing', 'act', 'long', 'enough', 'save', 'son', 'life', 'innocence', 'fact', 'Benigni', 'keeps', 'off', 'screen', 'horror', 'Holocaust', 'ending', 'more', 'powerful', 'have', 'seen', 'everything', 'eyes', 'son', 'yet', 'know', 'truth', 'son', 'not', 'final', 'shot', 'joyous', 'yet', 'poignant', 'leaving', 'suddenly', 'angry', 'moved', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'unexpected', 'ways.This', 'film', 'shown', 'quite', 'often', 'schools', 'Disney', 'released', 'special', 'edition', 'purpose', 'elements', 'will', 'add', 'discussion', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'history', 'affordable', 'price', 'teachers', 'schools', 'power', 'film', 'derived', 'joy', 'living', 'Benigni', 'magnificent', 'film', 'probably', 'not', 'appreciated', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'moving', 'testament', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'continue', 'joy', 'living', 'film', 'library', 'school', 'complete', 'foreign', 'film', 'masterpiece']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

At once we are reminded of the extremes of life - love and hatred, kindness and cruelty, laughter and sadness. Yet, through it all, ""Life is Beautiful"" for its optimism, courage and inner strength amidst adversity. Lessons that we as parents, as spouses and, above all else, as human beings should emulate.The film moves quickly thanks to Roberto Benigni's brilliant story, tightly woven script and slapstick humour. Indeed, at times I thought I was watching Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton or Harpo Marx in some scenes, i.e. the changing of hats, the horse in the restaurant, the umbrella dance, the runaway car, the exaggerated goosestep.As for the Miramax `Collector's Edition' DVD, it features various film trailers, an interview with Benigni nd his wife (Nicoletta Braschi) and an interactive menu with language options in Italian or English. I watched it in Italian with English subtitles, and although I don't speak the language, I found it relatively easy to follow.""Life is Beautiful"" really pulls at the heartstrings.

The first half of the film introduces us to Roberto Benigni's character, the Jewish Italian Guido.  Benigni's performance is immediately captivating and the story of his life in fascist Itlay before the war is lighthearted and quite enjoyable.  Then the Nazis take over his portion of Italy and Guido and his son end up in a concentration camp.  Despite this development, however, the movie's lighthearted tone doesn't change.  In fact, Guido shelters his son from the cold reality of what is going on around them.  This, of course, is utterly implausible and is the biggest flaw in the film.  Though the horrors of the Holocaust are by no means ignored, the unreality of the camp scenes make it difficult to figure out how one is supposed to react to the film.  Ultimately, the film is worthwhile to see Benigni's almost magical performance.

463529,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6305426651,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 5]","This highly acclaimed film is not without controversy.  The highly successful Italian comedian Roberto Benigni has created a film that uses all the time tested techniques of comedy and brings them to one of the most horrific chapters in human history, the systematic deaths of millions of Jewish people by the Germans in World War II. He is a master of slapstick which he combines with romantic comedy in the first half of the film. Every silly strategy from cars without breaks to raw eggs in hats is used. The first half of the film, except for a few references to fascism, is as light as a Rock Hudson and Doris Day romantic comedy with Benigni's wife Nicoletta Braschi playing his romantic interest. Benigni is the lovable clown character, the wise-fool, which is a standard in Western literature and films. In addition, Benigni uses a child actor, Giorgio Cantinini who is superb and is possibly the most appealing child actor since Shirley Temple in the 1930s. Thus there is a group of viewers who are thrilled and moved by the theme that a loving and inventive father could use his humor, intelligence, imagination, and love for his small son to hide and save that son in a concentration camp. This is understandable since we all want to believe that the human spirit can overcome all adversity and horror; that we can use our gifts to counter terror; that we can save innocence in the human condition through humor and creativity.However, there are also groups of viewers who found the film highly offensive and their criticism bears analysis and thought. The film has absolutely no historic accuracy and the German's created a systematic killing machine that was structured so that no one could save themselves, no matter how creative or funny they may be. In summary of these critics, they point out that Benigni does to the viewing audience exactly what the character Guido is doing for his little son, shielding the viewer from the real horror and terror of the holocaust.A defense of the film might be that the film attempts to show mankind at its best and mankind at its worst.

463530,A17N23WXA7EAF,6305426651,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[7, 19]","""Life is Beautiful"" is a superb film in many ways. Roberto Benigni is a brilliant comic actor and is certainly at the top of his game in this movie. Some scenes such as his impersonation of the fascist lecturer in the  Italian primary school are outstanding. In this scene, Benigni has posed as  the lecturer in order to get close to the teacher he is in love with.  Unfortunately before Benigni can approach her, he is asked to give the  students a lecture on Aryan racial superiority. So in a moment of genius  the swarthy, dark-haired Benigni strips down to his boxer shorts and  demonstrates his ""perfect Aryan features"".While I enjoyed the comic  genius of the film, I was deeply disturbed by its fictitious, understated  portrayal of the Nazi death camp. Anyone who has encountered documentary  footage and source material from the holocaust can see staggering contrasts  between the fictional death camp in ""Life is Beautiful"" and the real thing.  For example, real death camp prisoners would never have been as healthy  looking and well fed when disembarking from the cattle cars as the ones in  ""Life is Beautiful"". They would have been greeted with beatings, killings  and an instant sense of what the place was all about. If the child, Joshua  had survived for more than a few hours (which was almost impossible) he  would have been under no illusion about what kind of place he was in. If  you don't believe me then read the accounts of Elie Weisel and other  youthful survivors of the death camp. What life people clung to in such  places was brutal. The horror was so total and so pervasive that even a  genius like Roberto Benigni would never have successfully convinced his son  that the whole thing was a game.Does this make ""Life is Beautiful"" a bad  movie? Well, it does and it doesn't. The dramatic quality of the film is  superb. Unfortunately, the only way the film was able to float its main  premise-that a loving father could fool his son into thinking that a deadly  situation was just a game-was to tone down the holocaust. This is a  terribly irresponsible thing to do for the sake of dramatic quality. There  are only a few things in life are too staggering and too important to be  molded into comic material, but genocide is certainly one of them.",3,Holocaust Lite,963446400,"07 13, 2000",2000,2278,"['Life', 'Beautiful', 'superb', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'brilliant', 'comic', 'actor', 'certainly', 'top', 'game', 'movie', 'scenes', 'such', 'impersonation', 'fascist', 'lecturer', 'Italian', 'primary', 'school', 'are', 'outstanding', 'scene', 'Benigni', 'posed', 'lecturer', 'order', 'get', 'close', 'teacher', 'love', 'Unfortunately', 'Benigni', 'can', 'approach', 'asked', 'give', 'students', 'lecture', 'Aryan', 'racial', 'superiority', 'So', 'moment', 'genius', 'swarthy', 'dark-haired', 'Benigni', 'down', 'boxer', 'shorts', 'perfect', 'Aryan', 'features', 'enjoyed', 'comic', 'genius', 'film', 'was', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'fictitious', 'understated', 'portrayal', 'Nazi', 'death', 'camp', 'Anyone', 'who', 'encountered', 'documentary', 'footage', 'source', 'material', 'holocaust', 'can', 'see', 'staggering', 'contrasts', 'fictional', 'death', 'camp', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'real', 'thing', 'example', 'real', 'death', 'camp', 'prisoners', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'healthy', 'looking', 'well', 'fed', 'when', 'disembarking', 'cattle', 'cars', 'ones', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'greeted', 'beatings', 'killings', 'instant', 'sense', 'what', 'place', 'was', 'child', 'Joshua', 'had', 'survived', 'more', 'few', 'hours', 'was', 'almost', 'impossible', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'illusion', 'what', 'kind', 'place', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'then', 'read', 'accounts', 'Elie', 'Weisel', 'other', 'youthful', 'survivors', 'death', 'camp', 'What', 'life', 'people', 'clung', 'such', 'places', 'was', 'brutal', 'horror', 'was', 'so', 'total', 'so', 'pervasive', 'even', 'genius', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'successfully', 'convinced', 'son', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'game.Does', 'make', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'bad', 'movie', 'Well', ""n't"", 'dramatic', 'quality', 'film', 'superb', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'float', 'main', 'premise-that', 'loving', 'father', 'could', 'fool', 'son', 'thinking', 'deadly', 'situation', 'was', 'just', 'game-was', 'tone', 'down', 'holocaust', 'terribly', 'irresponsible', 'thing', 'do', 'sake', 'dramatic', 'quality', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'things', 'life', 'are', 'too', 'staggering', 'too', 'important', 'be', 'molded', 'comic', 'material', 'genocide', 'certainly', 'one']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

I am hardly surprised.  In fact I have yet to come across a person who has told me that he doesn't like this film.  When people watch a movie, they expect to be entertained.  Some expect to be touched, while others expect to be impressed.  'Life is beautiful' is capable of doing all that and more.A good comedy is hard to execute, a 'tragicomedy' harder and to draw a comedy out of the darkest period of mankind is almost impossible.  Benigni begged to differ.  His mind was set on showing you that laughter is the remedy of all ills.  He would make you forget to cry without demeaning the gravity of the situation.  Only at the very end would you feel the weight of this crime against humanity.The reason why the film works so well is because he brilliantly divided it up into two almost distinct segments.  Like a good salesman, before he makes the sale pitch, he would like to get personal with you.  For the first hour or so, he would introduce you to his family, charm you endlessly and before you have the chance to get bored, he would take you to the gutter.  By the time you are in the slaughterhouse (in this case literally), he has built up enough credibility that you no longer doubt him.  By that point, you would laugh with him and not at him.This film is not only about the triumph of humankind, it is also a triumph of moviemaking.

463532,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,6305426651,Char,"[1, 1]","Comedy and Tragedy are locked in a unique struggle around the main characters of this story set in WWII Italy.  Guido is a mad-cap Jewish waiter, a self-designated ""Principe."" Dora is the adored sweetheart that Guido calls ""Principesse.""  Joshua is the son that they have together, a darling kid who looks just like his father.The action of the story begins when, due to faulty brakes in a friend's convertible, Guido is driven at breakneck speed down the main street of a country town where he is mistaken for the King, whose arrival the townspeople are awaiting.  The people hail Guido as he races by, and he waves back at them, assuming the character of the King.The love story begins when Dora falls out of the sky and lands on top of Guido.  The two raise themselves up from a pile of hay and look at one another with pleased wonder and surprise, falling immediately in love.  Guido insists upon sucking a wasp's stinger out of Dora's thigh!Notice that Dora is wearing a big, pretty summer hat with a small black veil when she falls from Heaven into Guido's arms.  Notice that there are lots of hats in this movie.  A lot of hat-play goes on.  What meaning, if any, are we to deduce from the hat motifs?Back in the city, on the streets, other encounters between Guido and Principesse occur.  One is a freak accident in which Guido lands on top of Principesse and the two are splayed on the ground while school children laugh merrily at the sight!Later, the couple are thrown together again by circumstances and, as they walk about the city streets together, Guido is trying to get Principesse to say Yes to him and she says she doesn't know what the key to making her say Yes is.  She says that her father used to know very well how to get her to say Yes. Guido gets the bright idea to look up to Heaven and ask Mary for the key to make Dora say Yes.  Immediately, a key falls down from Heaven!  Each time that the couple prays to Mary, they get an immediate answer to their prayer.Guido and Dora long for one another, but Dora is engaged to marry someone else.  Her engagement party takes place at a restaurant where Guido is a waiter.  Alarmed to learn that Dora is engaged to another guy, he sends her a great big cake that says, ""Bon jour, Principesse,"" which is the greeting he uses often to please her and to recommend himself to her.  When Guido has to get down on the floor under the table to clean up something, Dora crawls under the table, too.  Tete-a-tete, she requests, ""Take me away.""  Guido hastens to comply with her wish.Next scene, Guido calmly and proudly enters the banquet hall seated upon a white horse that had been standing outside the hall and that belongs to a family member of his.  The horse is painted over with a lurid green color.  Vandals have written upon the horse, ""Achtung, Jewish Horse!"" and they've drawn a skull and crossbones on it.  Dora climbs up onto the horse with Guido and they ride out of the hall.  The horse is an emblem of the Jewish persecution that has begun in the city and that about six years later will send the married couple and their little boy, Joshua, to a Nazi prison camp.In prison, using his clever mad-cap ingenuity, Guido is able to hide his son in his bunk with him and to keep the boy distracted from the truth about the horror around them by making up a game about a contest for winning a tank, which is something Joshua wants keenly.The ending of the story when Guido is killed is heartbreaking and unbearably sad, but then, the sorrow is immediately uplifted.  The action of the film does not stop to dwell on death, but moves on, on a rather light note.  Joshua is now happy in his powerful, big tank that the liberating American soldier allows him to drive.  It's a bigger tank than he probably ever dreamed of winning.  He and his mother are together again and have one another.Guido, the clever fool, has saved his loved ones, especially his son, and Life will go on for them in a mildly Beautiful way, but it will not be even nearly so Beautiful for them as it was when Guido was leaping onto bikes and racing about and serving his son and his Principesse.I could understand all the slapstick involving hats was in the movie because Guido was a mad-cap character.  Guido's little family all wear hats, which seems fitting.  I couldn't understand all the slapstick involving eggs.  Was it just incidental?A nice thing about the film was, I thought, that we get to see the Yanks who liberate the camp in the role of strong, beneficent rescuers, as they used to be portrayed in the good ol' idealistic days following WWII.On first viewing, it's difficult to comprehend what's going on in the action of the movie.  It seems like jumbled nonsense because your attention is divided between trying to read the subtitles and watch the movie.  On second viewing, you can focus in better on the plot and characters and details of the action.",5,Viva the Fool!,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,4912,"['Comedy', 'Tragedy', 'are', 'locked', 'unique', 'struggle', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'set', 'WWII', 'Italy', 'Guido', 'mad-cap', 'Jewish', 'waiter', 'self-designated', 'Principe', 'Dora', 'adored', 'sweetheart', 'Guido', 'Principesse', 'Joshua', 'son', 'have', 'together', 'darling', 'kid', 'who', 'just', 'father.The', 'action', 'story', 'when', 'due', 'faulty', 'brakes', 'friend', 'convertible', 'Guido', 'driven', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'down', 'main', 'street', 'country', 'town', 'where', 'mistaken', 'King', 'arrival', 'townspeople', 'are', 'awaiting', 'people', 'hail', 'Guido', 'back', 'assuming', 'character', 'King.The', 'love', 'story', 'when', 'Dora', 'sky', 'top', 'Guido', 'two', 'raise', 'up', 'pile', 'hay', 'look', 'one', 'pleased', 'wonder', 'surprise', 'falling', 'immediately', 'love', 'Guido', 'sucking', 'wasp', 'stinger', 'Dora', 'thigh', 'Notice', 'Dora', 'wearing', 'big', 'pretty', 'summer', 'hat', 'small', 'black', 'veil', 'when', 'Heaven', 'Guido', 'arms', 'Notice', 'are', 'lots', 'hats', 'movie', 'lot', 'hat-play', 'What', 'meaning', 'are', 'deduce', 'hat', 'motifs', 'Back', 'city', 'streets', 'other', 'encounters', 'Guido', 'Principesse', 'occur', 'One', 'freak', 'accident', 'Guido', 'top', 'Principesse', 'two', 'are', 'splayed', 'ground', 'school', 'children', 'merrily', 'sight', 'Later', 'couple', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'again', 'circumstances', 'walk', 'city', 'together', 'Guido', 'trying', 'get', 'Principesse', 'say', 'Yes', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'key', 'making', 'say', 'Yes', 'father', 'used', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'how', 'get', 'say', 'Yes', 'Guido', 'bright', 'idea', 'look', 'up', 'Heaven', 'ask', 'Mary', 'key', 'make', 'Dora', 'say', 'Yes', 'Immediately', 'key', 'down', 'Heaven', 'time', 'couple', 'Mary', 'get', 'immediate', 'answer', 'prayer.Guido', 'Dora', 'long', 'one', 'Dora', 'engaged', 'marry', 'someone', 'else', 'Her', 'engagement', 'party', 'place', 'restaurant', 'where', 'Guido', 'waiter', 'Alarmed', 'learn', 'Dora', 'engaged', 'guy', 'great', 'big', 'cake', 'Bon', 'jour', 'Principesse', 'greeting', 'often', 'please', 'recommend', 'When', 'Guido', 'get', 'down', 'floor', 'table', 'clean', 'up', 'something', 'Dora', 'table', 'too', 'Tete-a-tete', 'Take', 'away', 'Guido', 'comply', 'wish.Next', 'scene', 'Guido', 'calmly', 'proudly', 'banquet', 'hall', 'seated', 'white', 'horse', 'had', 'been', 'standing', 'hall', 'family', 'member', 'horse', 'painted', 'lurid', 'green', 'color', 'Vandals', 'have', 'written', 'horse', 'Achtung', 'Jewish', 'Horse', ""'ve"", 'drawn', 'skull', 'crossbones', 'Dora', 'up', 'horse', 'Guido', 'ride', 'hall', 'horse', 'emblem', 'Jewish', 'persecution', 'begun', 'city', 'six', 'years', 'later', 'will', 'send', 'married', 'couple', 'little', 'boy', 'Joshua', 'Nazi', 'prison', 'camp.In', 'prison', 'using', 'clever', 'mad-cap', 'ingenuity', 'Guido', 'able', 'hide', 'son', 'bunk', 'keep', 'boy', 'distracted', 'truth', 'horror', 'making', 'up', 'game', 'contest', 'winning', 'tank', 'something', 'Joshua', 'keenly.The', 'ending', 'story', 'when', 'Guido', 'killed', 'heartbreaking', 'unbearably', 'sad', 'then', 'sorrow', 'immediately', 'uplifted', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'stop', 'dwell', 'death', 'moves', 'rather', 'light', 'note', 'Joshua', 'now', 'happy', 'powerful', 'big', 'tank', 'liberating', 'American', 'soldier', 'drive', 'bigger', 'tank', 'probably', 'ever', 'dreamed', 'winning', 'mother', 'are', 'together', 'again', 'have', 'one', 'another.Guido', 'clever', 'fool', 'saved', 'loved', 'ones', 'especially', 'son', 'Life', 'will', 'go', 'mildly', 'Beautiful', 'way', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'even', 'nearly', 'so', 'Beautiful', 'was', 'when', 'Guido', 'was', 'leaping', 'bikes', 'racing', 'about', 'serving', 'son', 'Principesse.I', 'could', 'understand', 'slapstick', 'involving', 'hats', 'was', 'movie', 'Guido', 'was', 'mad-cap', 'character', 'Guido', 'little', 'family', 'wear', 'hats', 'fitting', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'slapstick', 'involving', 'eggs', 'Was', 'just', 'incidental', 'nice', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'thought', 'get', 'see', 'Yanks', 'who', 'liberate', 'camp', 'role', 'strong', 'beneficent', 'rescuers', 'used', 'be', 'portrayed', 'good', 'ol', 'idealistic', 'days', 'following', 'WWII.On', 'first', 'viewing', 'difficult', 'comprehend', 'what', 'going', 'action', 'movie', 'jumbled', 'nonsense', 'attention', 'divided', 'trying', 'read', 'subtitles', 'watch', 'movie', 'second', 'viewing', 'can', 'focus', 'better', 'plot', 'characters', 'details', 'action']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

The plot follows the Jewish character,Guido Orifici, as he attempts to woo his 'principessa', the beautiful Dora. She leaves her Aryan fascist fianc&eacute;e for the amusing and loveable Guido, but just as they start to enjoy their life together, Italy becomes suffocated by the influence of Nazi power. Eventually Guido, along with their son, is captured and sent to Auschwitz. Despite her wealthy and influential background, Dora refuses to be left behind and demands a place on the death train beside them. When they reach Auschwitz, Guido desperately attempts to keep his son from being afraid by pretending that they are participating in a game to win a tank, rather than being held against their will.The references to the mass murder of the Jewish nation are all the more powerful through their subtlety: we are shown vans full of women driving off not to return, a group of old people and children undressing for the showers which cuts to the piles of empty clothes, and finally a smokey obscured image of the horrific pile up of corpses in the camp. The film is both beautiful and brutal and you will find yourself simultaneously laughing out loud and crying, captivated by Guido's touching attempts to keep his son safe and alive. It is a beautiful celebration of a father's love for his son and of the sacrifices and bravery that went on in order to liberate the surviving members of Auschwitz from the death camps.",5,Very moving,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,1653,"['Having', 'watched', 'big', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'holocaust', 'Schindler', 'List', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'moved', 'Benigni', 'attempt', 'show', 'courage', 'pain', 'Jewish', 'victims', 'film', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'plot', 'Jewish', 'character', 'Guido', 'Orifici', 'woo', ""'principessa"", 'beautiful', 'Dora', 'Aryan', 'fascist', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'amusing', 'loveable', 'Guido', 'just', 'start', 'enjoy', 'life', 'together', 'Italy', 'becomes', 'suffocated', 'influence', 'Nazi', 'power', 'Eventually', 'Guido', 'son', 'captured', 'sent', 'Auschwitz', 'wealthy', 'influential', 'background', 'Dora', 'be', 'left', 'place', 'death', 'train', 'When', 'reach', 'Auschwitz', 'Guido', 'desperately', 'keep', 'son', 'being', 'afraid', 'pretending', 'are', 'participating', 'game', 'win', 'tank', 'rather', 'being', 'held', 'will.The', 'references', 'mass', 'murder', 'Jewish', 'nation', 'are', 'more', 'powerful', 'subtlety', 'are', 'shown', 'vans', 'full', 'women', 'driving', 'off', 'not', 'return', 'group', 'old', 'people', 'children', 'undressing', 'showers', 'cuts', 'piles', 'empty', 'clothes', 'finally', 'smokey', 'obscured', 'image', 'horrific', 'corpses', 'camp', 'film', 'beautiful', 'brutal', 'will', 'find', 'simultaneously', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'crying', 'captivated', 'Guido', 'touching', 'attempts', 'keep', 'son', 'safe', 'alive', 'beautiful', 'celebration', 'father', 'love', 'son', 'sacrifices', 'bravery', 'went', 'order', 'liberate', 'surviving', 'members', 'Auschwitz', 'death', 'camps']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

Then WWII breaks out and the whole family is herded off to a concentration camp.  This doesn't sound like the plot synopsis of a comedy, but this is no ordinary comedy.  It is a heartwarming affirmation of life, as Guido tries to shield his son from the horrors of the camp by making a game out of it.  Guido makes up the rules as he goes along: ""You must hide and never let the angry people [the guards] see you - we get 50 points for every day you stay hidden!""There are many things to like about the film.  The performances are charming (Benigni won an Oscar as Guido).  The screenplay is well-constructed, in that it doesn't shy away from the reality of the holocaust (e.g., Guido's elderly uncle is dispatched in the gas chamber), but can still be sweet and funny.  In fact, the jarring effect of arriving at the concentration camp is more pronounced in this film because it's so farcical and lighthearted in the beginning.This DVD version has clean video and audio (at least, on the Italian track - I have not listened to the dubbed version).  Unfortunately, as is typical of Mirimax, the extras on the DVD are mostly promotional materials.  For example, the Making Of featurette is essentially a half hour of sound bits from people praising the film.  Some are convincing, such as the director of the Simon Weisenthal Centre stating how the film is important for raising awareness of the Holocaust.  But where are the dissenting views?  It is well-known that Steven Spielberg hated the film because he felt it belittled the Holocaust.  Another feature is a complete (?) set of about 20 television ads, all of which are about the same, each with a different award that the film won.  What's the point of that?  There is no commentary, no deleted scenes, etc.  All-in-all, there's no reason to buy the DVD over the VHS except possibly for the choice of subtitles/language tracks.Thus, this film is fantastic, and deserves better in the DVD format than this version gives.",4,"Great film, essentially featureless DVD",1024531200,"06 20, 2002",2002,2078,"['Guido', 'Italian', 'Jew', 'bookstore', 'gentile', 'woman', 'marry', 'have', 'son', 'Then', 'WWII', 'out', 'whole', 'family', 'herded', 'off', 'concentration', 'camp', ""n't"", 'sound', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'comedy', 'ordinary', 'comedy', 'heartwarming', 'affirmation', 'life', 'Guido', 'shield', 'son', 'horrors', 'camp', 'making', 'game', 'Guido', 'up', 'rules', 'along', 'must', 'hide', 'never', 'let', 'angry', 'people', '[', 'guards', ']', 'see', 'get', '50', 'points', 'day', 'stay', 'hidden', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'film', 'performances', 'are', 'charming', 'Benigni', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Guido', 'screenplay', 'well-constructed', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'reality', 'holocaust', 'e.g.', 'Guido', 'elderly', 'uncle', 'dispatched', 'gas', 'chamber', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'sweet', 'funny', 'fact', 'jarring', 'effect', 'arriving', 'concentration', 'camp', 'more', 'pronounced', 'film', 'so', 'farcical', 'lighthearted', 'beginning.This', 'DVD', 'version', 'clean', 'video', 'audio', 'least', 'Italian', 'track', 'have', 'not', 'listened', 'dubbed', 'version', 'Unfortunately', 'typical', 'Mirimax', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'mostly', 'promotional', 'materials', 'example', 'Making', 'featurette', 'essentially', 'half', 'hour', 'sound', 'bits', 'people', 'praising', 'film', 'are', 'convincing', 'such', 'director', 'Simon', 'Weisenthal', 'Centre', 'stating', 'how', 'film', 'important', 'raising', 'awareness', 'Holocaust', 'where', 'are', 'dissenting', 'views', 'well-known', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'hated', 'film', 'felt', 'belittled', 'Holocaust', 'feature', 'complete', 'set', '20', 'television', 'ads', 'are', 'same', 'different', 'award', 'film', 'won', 'What', 'point', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'etc', 'All-in-all', 'reason', 'buy', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'possibly', 'choice', 'subtitles/language', 'tracks.Thus', 'film', 'fantastic', 'better', 'DVD', 'format', 'version']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

This lovely little movie is so charming and so sweet, I don't know how anyone could dislike it. I do realize that the star, Roberto Benigni, sometimes is over the top and tends to annoy some people but that is so far from the truth involving this film. We see his character meet a beautiful woman and his attempts to woo her. When they fall in love, marry and have a child, all seems perfect---until World War II and the beginning of the Holocaust.

It received seven Oscar nominations and three rightful wins: Best Foreign Film, Best Original Score, and Best Actor(Roberto Benigni).  Its plot is brilliant.  Such chain of events rarely fit as one credible movie.  Benigni's writing brilliance makes everything fit.  Amazingly, the plot takes a severe historic tragedy and offers more hope of survival, namely Guido telling his son that this is a game of trying to win the tank.  Though nothing about The Holocaust was good, this accurately desplicts the trials of its victims.  The movie combines tragedy, magic, and love.  The acting is wonderful.  Everyone pours their heart and soul through their characters.  Their previous research about the real-life victims shines through every scene.  Such rough emotions are never held back for a second.  The set and the costume designs were manufactured wonderfully.  They accurately desplict the styles of 1939-1945.  The elaborate settings give the added magical or tragic vibe, depending on the individual scene.  &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; is a great movie for those looking for a unique, powerful drama.  The italian version is much better than the english version.  The english version takes away much of the intended emotion.

I can well understand the reservations that many bring to this film.  It is important to note, however, that Benigni's comedy never makes light of the Holocaust itself; rather, it is the means by which the resourceful Guido (Benigni) attempts to salvage his son's innocence.  Guido is a heroic character, using the only tools at his command in a desperate situation.  When the child is not present, the film does allow us a few darker glimpses at the horror of the camps although these are admittedly few.I believe that humor, being one of the most delightful inventions of human creativity, can be an appropriate response to the darkness that also exists in the human soul.

Director and star Roberto Benigni has created a fairy tale with an edge.  An irrepressible Jewish waiter falls in love with a socialite, winning her away from her Fascist fiance with a mix of humor, coincidence, opportunism and whimsy.  They have a son and find themselves in the midst of a Jewish pogrom that transports them to an unnamed concentration camp.  Father ""Guido"" uses the same skill set that he used to win his wife to protect his four-year old son from the brutality that surrounds him, convincing him that the camp is an elaborate holiday and game in which the winner will receive a new tank.Benigni's performance (which won a Best Actor Academy Award--rare for a foreign language film) is a masterwork--manic, touching, hilarious and affecting in about every possible way.  The scene where he translates a German soldier's camp instructions for the benefit of his son is priceless (""No lollipops!  Don't even think about asking!"") His wife Dora is beautiful and bemused in the first act and exists more symbolically, but still powerfully in the second.  The very young actor who plays son Joshua is amazing--portraying the wide-eyed enthusiasm of his father combined with a mistrustful wisdom well beyond his years.Like the recent French film ""Amelie"", ""Beatiful"" has a whimsical soul.  The concentration camp sometimes seems a little too smooth, a feature that Spielberg films on serious subjects are sometimes accused of.  Still, the Germans were known for the their organization and order, and the story doesn't really need grisly depictions of much of what went on during the Holocaust to make its point.  The production design also fits with the fairy tale feeling of the tale.My wife doesn't much care for foreign films, but said she felt like she'd learned some Italian watching this one.  My daughter doesn't like foreign films or period movies.  Both loved ""Life is Beautiful.""

The comic fairy tale romance of pre-WWII Italy at the film's beginning, and the (sanitized) nightmare of a father and his young son being held in a Nazi camp in the second half, work like oil and water; though Benigni tries--valiantly--he can't quite pull it off.  (One wonders if the film  might have worked better had the son known the father was faking his desperate cheerfulness, and was going along with the act to indulge him; then, the subtext might have gelled into something stronger and more poignant.)  And the ""happy"" ending will strike a discordant note with many viewers.  Still, it's almost impossible to criticize a  film which so many have clutched to their hearts as a life-altering  experience--you go with it, or you don't, period.  Many adored Begnini's clowning, whereas others found it as subtle and endearing as a jackhammer to the skull.

Instead, I waited for the DVD.  However, what I perceived as hype was truly deserved.  ""Life is Beautiful"" is a wonderfully inventive tale that seems fresh even today, years after its first release.  Part slapstick, part drama, part romantic comedy, part tragedy - this story of an Italian family during the Holocaust defies categorization.The films opens with Guido (Benigni) and his friend arriving in town on a car with no brakes and being mistaken for facist officials expected for a parade.  This slapstick scene ends with Guido catching the future love of his life, Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), as she jumps from a barn window.  The clownish Guido sets out to win her heart despite the odds against him.  These early scenes set the stage for the rest of the movie:  Guido will rely on invention, humor, and persistence to protect his loved ones despite the obstacles he faces.  What begins as slapstick becomes heartbreaking later.  Like all stories of the Holocaust, this film has its grim side, but Benigni relies heavily on exaggerated humor, running gags, and an early circus-like atmosphere to set up the emotional power of the time's reality.  Most of the atrocities are implied, not witnessed, and the viewer's own knowledge of the time period creates an additional layer of tension.Roberto Benigni is superb as Guido; his antics are hilarious, but during more dire moments, emotions flash across his face, revealing both the depth of his character and the reality of his position.  Nicoletta Braschi is also good, and little Giorgio Cantinini as Guido?s son Joshua is adorably spunky, especially as he questions his father's stories.I always advocate watching foreign films in the original language, with subtitles, but I understand that some viewers may not like ""reading"" a movie.  In this case, however, the dubbed version was distracting, as Benigni provides the English track for his own character while American voices dub the rest of the cast.  His Italian accent amid the American accents completely broke the illusion for me.  Still, if a dubbed version is the only way you'll watch this movie, please do it.I highly recommend ""Life is Beautiful."" Its offbeat approach remains unparalleled in the canon of Holocaust movies.

463562,A2DBWD5OPCJYDS,6305426651,Deborah Lovelace,"[1, 2]","Roberto Benigni brillantly and passionatly portrays an Italian Jewish waiter and bookstore owner, who has a flair at solving life's many riddles, during the waning days of World War II in Europe. Combining Italian Realism  with many elements of Classic Hollywood Cinema, Guido (Benigni) invites the  viewer to find the beauty in each and every day of life, and to openly and  assertively express and embrace love at every opportunity, because one  never knows when and how that love will be tested, or physically torn from  one's self. Guido approaches his ultimate test of his strength of love when  he and his young son are forced into a concentration camp, and his wife, a  non-Jew, chooses to join them. Guido uses his brilliant talent at solving  riddles, and his deep understanding that through an unselfish love, life  can be what you make of it. In this case, Guido solves the real life  riddles of how to help his son survive, and how to help his wife retain  hope in a situation that would leave most of us withdrawn into ourselves by  dispair. He convinces his son that the &quot;stay&quot; in the  concentration camp is a planned game for his birthday, and, even though the  game is not much fun, the reward of playing, and winning, is receiving a  real tank of his very own. Guido supports his wife by taking every unusual  opportunity to communicate to her that he and their son are alive, and she  can live one more day in hope that they all will be together again. Guido  understands that life is most beautiful when love is put into juxtaposition  with the ridiculousness of blind hatred fueled by fear. Another theme of  this film is that one must be able to find something of beauty and value to  love within one's self, and without one's self, in order to simply survive  the most horrific riddles, or terrifying life conditions, that humans  sometimes find themselves. Benigni does not make light of the overwhelming  suffering and pain that was experienced by Jews in the concentration camps.

There are real-life Guidos in this world and when faced with a grave threat like Auschwitz, they somehow find a way to rise above it.  The late Pope John Paul II was no stranger to the horrors of Nazism and Soviet communism, especially in Poland not far from Auschwitz, and it is a fitting tribute to ""Life is Beautiful"" that he considered it his favorite movie.  It is much the same with me and I plan to see it often enough to be able to understand it in Italian without subtitles (so as to take it in more like the way it was intended).

There's the same attempt to reduce the worse horror in human history to the absurd.  Perhaps this is a way of comprehending something monstrous beyond comprehension.  Benigni was criticized in some circles for trivializing the Holocaust, but that is not what he did.  He sought to rise above it.  I don't know whether he or Ionesco were really successful.  On the other hand has anybody-any religion, philosophy or great artist-ever solved the problem of evil in this world?There's something of Charlie Chaplin in Benigni's irrepressible hero, and in the camera work look for the influence of Orson Wells in light and shadow.

And, if we are beautiful (on the inside, where true beauty lives), then we will see beauty everywhere we look.Life Is Beautiful puts this idea to the test. It posits a carefree, happy-go-lucky book salesman who romances a well-to-do lady in Mussolini's Italy (the film starts just on the onset of WWII). As he weds her, and they rear a child, they are soon put into jeopardy due to his Jewish heritage. Ultimately, they are sent to a Concentration Camp where his carefree, imaginitive and unceasingly joyful attitude are the only things that keep him, and his son, from utter despair.Humor? Romance? Carefree? In a Nazi Death Camp?To some, this is blasphemous. But to the makers of this film, and our lead character, life is beautiful, and this vision is taken from their perspective. That the film manages to show that there is joy, love and beauty--even in the worst imaginable conditions--is a testament to the way in which the film succeeds, and also to the basic truth of the message.

There is no other word to describe it.  This film is beautiful, and it definitely makes you appreciate and value life more.I know some people have trouble picturing a film whose subject matter is the Holocaust that starts out as such a bubbly comedy.  But, that is exactly the tone that the director and writers (Roberto Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami) developed, and it's brilliant.  Guido (Benigni) is a young, Jewish-Italian man with a wonderful sense of humor and a gusto for life.  He falls madly in love with Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), a beautiful woman who he continues to pursue (even when she is engaged to be married to another man!).  Of course, love conquers all.  However, the second half takes a decidedly different turn when he and his son (Giorgio Cantarini) are placed in a concentration camp.  This is when Guido's inventiveness and imagination become invaluable tools in shielding his son from the horrors they encounter there.It is rare that I see a film that leaves me so breathless as this one does, ten years later.  This is the film that Roberto Benigni will be most remembered for, and for good reason.  I suggest that you watch this for your heart, your soul and your spirit.

463574,A3LEJ7UEJQDQNA,6305426651,Eddy Oquendo,"[0, 0]","Many films, in the movie theater and on television, have documented the horrors of The Holocaust. The best of these -- most notably, Speilberg's masterpiece, &quot;Schindler's List&quot; -- relate human anguish and evil  incarnate in startling clarity. What's interesting is that as poignant and  disturbing as these works have been, they often fail to drive home the  unbridled emotion that one would expect from such detail. Perhaps this is  due to a sort of &quot;historical phenomena;&quot; intellectually -- and  correctly -- we feel that we should be moved, but it's like reading a text  book, the most profound emotional connection is lost. With &quot;Life is  Beautiful,&quot; that elusive bond is crystallized. That is the genius --  yes, genius -- of this film; the relatively cold mental link is superceded  by the ethereal in all of us.This marvelous film is, as our narrator  informs us, a fable. The humor is onerously silly, at least by American  standards, but it often works. What's unexpectedly wonderful about the  lightheartedness of the first half of the movie is that it masterfully sets  up the second half. Our idyllic little family, Guido, Dora, and Joshua, are  beset upon by a damnable twist of fate -- AND WE ARE TAKEN WITH THEM! What  comes next is nothing short of movie magic, that which makes a film a  classic. Guido, through a series of thoroughly implausible actions, manages  to pull our heartstrings like -- unbelievably -- no other film concerning  The Holocaust ever has!While the film has come under fire from some  circles for not depicting an egregious event in history accurately or  reverently, I believe that the detractors have focused their senses in the  wrong direction.

The story is so touching, so hauntingly beautiful that five  stars alone aren't enough for it. Like Amazon.com's reviewer said, &quot;he  accomplishes the impossible&quot;...the film is basically told in two  parts. The first part tells of the story of Guido(Roberto Benigni) who  keeps having accidental encounters with a young, beautiful woman, Dora  (played by Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's wife off the screen), and he is so  fixated by her that he does literally everything he can to see her again.  In the second part, Dora and Guido are married and have a son, Guosu&egrave;.  Guido and his son are taken off to a concentration camp, but Guousu&egrave; is  much too young to understand the enormity of the horrors around him, and  Guido knows this, so he makes it look like a big game for his son...a game  where upon the contestants, amassing a total of 1000 points, win a tank- a  real one.  It's a genuinely heartwarming film with glorious performances by  all. It's so original, so engaging, once you start you don't want to stop  watching it...this film is one of the best films I've ever seen, and also I  believe that all the awards it got, it deserved.

Upon arriving to their dreary destination, Guido has a choice to make.  He can either tell his young son the brutal truth about their future or he can lie to him, thus preserving his son's childhood innocence.  Guido chooses the latter alternative.Now, realistically, Guido's antics would never work.  However, if you're willing to suspend disbelief, then you're in for a very touching story about the lengths a father will go to protect his son.  And what makes this story even more touching is that even though Guido is being tortured daily, he nonetheless puts on a happy face around his son and does whatever he can to keep his son's spirits up.What I also appreciated about this movie was that the young son isn't portrayed as a gullible kid who simply goes along with the program.  He's a smart kid who challenges what his father is telling him and this creates suspense, making you wonder how Guido will get his son to believe his lies.  His tricks are pretty clever.The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, though, is that the first half of the movie is very disorganized.  I kept wondering where this movie was going and how on earth it won an Oscar.

463582,A228NBNLYJ8V3J,6305426651,Eran Cohen,"[10, 37]","About a year ago I wrote a controversial review over this movie. I decided to pull it off in the end because I realized it didn't convey my opinion correctly.Today I want to repeat my efforts to point out the things that were wrong in this film, because I truly think someone did here something unjustified and got away with it.I know the most see it a remarkable 'human spirit victory', not me.To begin with, it's all attached to the way you allow yourself to perceive the Holocaust.Most recently, I've read the opinion of an Austrian Philosopher, that his beliefs raised much ado in the European academies. He has published an article that, in short, speaks about the need to percept the actuality of the Holocaust as another tragedy among many in the 20th century. He reminds us that there were more than a few like-Shoas genocide events and that one shouldn't dramatize this in particular.He resents the sacredness people are giving to the Holocaust, and claims that it harms the greater goal of healing and evolving to a better humanity as a whole.Why have I mentioned this ?  Because I suspect his thoughts, in a way , are given form in this film.First of all, you'd have to agree with me that the main subject of this movie is the Holocaust(and the efforts to inclose it from the child). Moreover, it's not just a comedy - it has a purpose.Now we can begin our journey. Half a movie is evidently almost a pure comedy. The terror that is to come is cued, very subtly. With the other half I have my problems, because here we really enter the concentration camp, and the Holocaust.Up till now, ok, the father concealed the truth from the son -and from the rest of the viewers. But once in the camp - the comedy continues, AND, a person can get the impression that this is what it really was.I would causiously say taht you might give legitimacy to Holocaust deniers by screening this film-they will find a lot to hang on to. It's wrong to put things in this light. You see the reality of the camp through the eyes of a child ,as a game, and people might think - hell, maybe that what it really was, everything else is another pulp fiction of the Jews !I feel that this movie help those who are responsible, or feel responsible to polish their conscience. How? By pretending it wasn't that bad, not to say it wasn't at all. Recall this scene: after the supper with the Germans, the father takes his son to their quarters. There is mist all around, and everything is foggy - and exactly then he witnesses for the first and last time a stack of dead bodies ,apparently Jews, the only innuendo in the film for what is really going on . He fortunately succeeds in preventing his son from seeing.The wrong is the whole atmosphere which allude us this was all a dream,a Nightmare - the dead pile wasn't real!Look, I didn't spend watching the movie searching for things like that, but it just popped up and really bothered me - and there are more examples like that .I admit, an article I'd read before I saw the movie influenced me. But aren't we all ?We criticize things all the time - so why regard a `non harmful' comedy, when it is about the Shoa, as it is? I looked deeper and found disturbing messages all over the film that I feel shouldn't be ignored. That's why it was important for me to express it, even though most folks disagree.  Do not take the film as innocent as it appears! This 'comedy' had a purpose, and it wasn't just to entertain us.Getting back to the Philosopher I started with, this film is the first I know ,that allows itself to look in another glasses over the ,up to this point, a somber ,terrible and serious tragedy. 'All the sudden' it is fine not to dramatize the whole concept . We can start talking now with the `take it easy' terms. It's not a major disgraceful point in the humanity evolution anymore, like it can be interpreted from the opinion of the Philosopher.I hope reading this clarified your understanding of my resentment from the movie,though you may still wouldn't agree with me...",2,This life is not so beautiful...,1000339200,"09 13, 2001",2001,4027,"['year', 'ago', 'wrote', 'controversial', 'review', 'movie', 'decided', 'pull', 'off', 'end', 'realized', 'did', ""n't"", 'convey', 'opinion', 'correctly.Today', 'want', 'repeat', 'efforts', 'point', 'out', 'things', 'were', 'wrong', 'film', 'truly', 'think', 'someone', 'did', 'here', 'something', 'unjustified', 'got', 'away', 'it.I', 'know', 'most', 'see', 'remarkable', ""'human"", 'spirit', 'victory', 'not', 'me.To', 'begin', 'attached', 'way', 'allow', 'perceive', 'Holocaust.Most', 'recently', ""'ve"", 'read', 'opinion', 'Austrian', 'Philosopher', 'beliefs', 'raised', 'much', 'ado', 'European', 'academies', 'published', 'article', 'short', 'need', 'percept', 'actuality', 'Holocaust', 'tragedy', 'many', '20th', 'century', 'were', 'more', 'few', 'like-Shoas', 'genocide', 'events', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'dramatize', 'particular.He', 'resents', 'sacredness', 'people', 'are', 'giving', 'Holocaust', 'claims', 'greater', 'goal', 'healing', 'evolving', 'better', 'humanity', 'whole.Why', 'have', 'mentioned', 'suspect', 'thoughts', 'way', 'are', 'given', 'form', 'film.First', ""'d"", 'have', 'agree', 'main', 'subject', 'movie', 'Holocaust', 'efforts', 'inclose', 'child', 'Moreover', 'not', 'just', 'comedy', 'purpose.Now', 'can', 'begin', 'journey', 'movie', 'evidently', 'almost', 'pure', 'comedy', 'terror', 'come', 'cued', 'very', 'subtly', 'other', 'half', 'have', 'problems', 'here', 'really', 'enter', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Holocaust.Up', 'till', 'now', 'ok', 'father', 'concealed', 'truth', 'son', '-and', 'rest', 'viewers', 'once', 'camp', 'comedy', 'AND', 'person', 'can', 'get', 'impression', 'what', 'really', 'was.I', 'would', 'causiously', 'say', 'taht', 'might', 'give', 'legitimacy', 'Holocaust', 'deniers', 'screening', 'film-they', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'hang', 'wrong', 'put', 'things', 'light', 'see', 'reality', 'camp', 'eyes', 'child', 'game', 'people', 'might', 'think', 'hell', 'maybe', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'everything', 'else', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'Jews', 'feel', 'movie', 'help', 'who', 'are', 'responsible', 'feel', 'responsible', 'polish', 'conscience', 'How', 'pretending', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'not', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'Recall', 'scene', 'supper', 'Germans', 'father', 'son', 'quarters', 'mist', 'everything', 'foggy', 'exactly', 'then', 'first', 'last', 'time', 'stack', 'dead', 'bodies', 'apparently', 'Jews', 'only', 'innuendo', 'film', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'fortunately', 'preventing', 'son', 'seeing.The', 'wrong', 'whole', 'atmosphere', 'allude', 'was', 'dream', 'Nightmare', 'dead', 'pile', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'Look', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'watching', 'movie', 'searching', 'things', 'just', 'popped', 'up', 'really', 'bothered', 'are', 'more', 'examples', '.I', 'admit', 'article', ""'d"", 'read', 'saw', 'movie', 'influenced', 'are', ""n't"", 'criticize', 'things', 'time', 'so', 'why', 'regard', 'non', 'harmful', 'comedy', 'when', 'Shoa', 'looked', 'deeper', 'found', 'disturbing', 'messages', 'film', 'feel', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', 'why', 'was', 'important', 'express', 'even', 'most', 'folks', 'disagree', 'Do', 'not', 'take', 'film', 'as', 'innocent', ""'comedy"", 'had', 'purpose', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'entertain', 'us.Getting', 'back', 'Philosopher', 'started', 'film', 'first', 'know', 'look', 'glasses', 'up', 'point', 'somber', 'terrible', 'serious', 'tragedy', 'sudden', 'fine', 'not', 'dramatize', 'whole', 'concept', 'can', 'start', 'talking', 'now', 'take', 'easy', 'terms', 'not', 'major', 'disgraceful', 'point', 'humanity', 'evolution', 'anymore', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'opinion', 'Philosopher.I', 'hope', 'reading', 'clarified', 'understanding', 'resentment', 'movie', 'may', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'agree']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

463585,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,6305426651,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[7, 8]","Released to movie theaters in 1998, like many people, I could not conceive how a comedy and satire about the Holocaust would be an award-winning film ... yet having viewed it, I *do* now understand: it is the personality of Roberto Benigni who uses Charlie Chaplinesque comedy techniques to emphasize the tragic events which seem even more intense as the viewer knows the truth. Roberto Benigni plays Guido, a waiter who moves to Arezzo, Italy and literally bumps into Dora (played by Nicoletta Braschi, his real-life wife), a stylish and attractive young lady, with whom he instantly falls in love, only to learn she is engaged to someone else. As luck would have it, he is the waiter at their engagement reception - where all kinds of mishaps occur, as Guido tries to engage Dora's attention. He accidentally drops something on the floor and crawls beneath the table to retrieve it while Dora peeks under the table and crawls half-way to meet him ... where they exchange a secret kiss (despite her fiance sitting at the table). One thing leads to another, Guido magically rides in on a green-painted horse, sweeping Dora up onto the saddle with him, as they ride off ... together to be married.Next, more than five years has passed, as the present turns into the future, within the courtyard of Guido's home ... Their son Joshua is the sunshine of their lives, as he sits on the bicycle along side his mother, as Guido peddles into the town. Joshua tends the bookstore while his dad is taken off to the police station, to register as a Jewish store owner. Guido does the famous goose-step routine to entertain his son ... Shortly afterwards, on Joshua's birthday, the local Jewish population is taken off to internment. Guido tells Joshua a story about going on a trip, a secret trip, only his mother knows about it. Guido establishes the rules of the game, where on this trip, if they earn 1000 points, Joshua wins a *real* tank. As a little boy, Joshua is in love with his toy tank ...There are numerous poignant scenes within the film which emphasize the risks Guido is willing to take to keep his wife and son safe from harm. He manages to send Dora a very personal message by playing an opera song on a loudspeaker, and even Joshua gets in a loving message to his mother. Guido continues the game, despite Joshua's suspicions, as other prisoners give him messages of what is truly happening at the camp. One of the most bizzare twists is when, Joshua manages to escape from taking a shower ... his dad says, you should take the shower (as meaning a real cleansing one) ... not knowing that Joshua's life was held in the balance, and tilted toward ""life"" by having refused and run away from the shower which meant *certain* death. The rescue scene by an American soldier, who has Joshua hop on board for a ride is very moving ... especially when realizing Guido who was dressed as a woman with a babushka tied beneath her chin, had just been caught, and led away into an alley, where gunfire was heard in the distance. The German soldier walked out alone ... The fact is, Guido sacrified himself in search of his family after the war was declared over, and in the end, had died in the attempt to keep his family alive. To appreciate the magic of this film ... it must viewed, with an open mind. There is no doubt in my mind, the film deserves the 70 world-wide film festival awards it has won ... including the prestigious Gran Prix at Cannes, three awards in Jerusalem, including the Mayor's award and the Jerusalem Medal,  Best Actor, Best Score, and Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards and at the European Film Awards, Best Film and Best Actor.

Guido is articulate, fun, possesses a great imagination and upon arrival falls in love with the woman of his dreams, who ""falls from the sky into his arms."" Dora, played by Benigni's real life wife, actress Nicoletta Braschi, is dating and is soon to be married to a man that Guido runs into and with whom Guido has several controversial episodes which serve to add great adventure and fun to the story.Thanks to several encounters where Guido and Dora end up in each other's arms, Guido conquers Dora's heart and they marry, forming a beautiful family. We meet their son, played by Giorgio Cantarini... and the child is simply magnificent as the stubborn, intelligent and precocious boy that struggles to live through the Holocaust.At some point, this ideal family life is shattered by the Nazis who arrest and ship the men off to a concentration camp. Because she is Italian, Dora is not arrested but she goes to the train station and commands the Gestapo in charge to stop the train because there has been a mistake. He reviews the list and tells her that no mistake has been made, she is not Jewish and therefore, has not been selected to go, but she explains that her husband and son are on the train, therefore, she too... must go on their journey. The saga that ensues is simply heart wrenching because Guido attempts to do something that we know is impossible, make believe that the concentration camp experience is part of a game designed to determine a winner of a real tank. He does this to shield the child from the horror of what they have to endure each and every day.What we enjoy most about owning DVD's is that we get to see the special features and bonus material provided with the films. In this DVD, the extras include interviews with many actors that had the honor of working with Benigni, who comment on his personality and charismatic human power. The interviews answer the question: would a Jew be offended by attempting to bring humor, fun, and hope into circumstances surrounding the Holocaust? They conclude that the film surfaces the horror of it all and yet, provides an endearing vision into the best of humanity; a father that risks it all to make sure his child is not traumatized by the insanity created by the most evil machine ever conceived.

A year ago, I would've no doubt awarded this movie a perfect five star rating. However, I've now taken other things into consideration.First off, I'd like to say that this is a truly magical film, and I have no idea how the producers managed to do it. It's so ugly, but at the same time, so beautiful. The whole time you're watching, you're crying, but also smiling at the same time.La Vita E Bella [Life is Beautiful] is the story about a young, secular Jewish family in Italy during the Holocaust. It tells about the love of a father to his child. The father risks everything he's got - his life - to make his and his son's stay at a concentration camp a tad bit more bearable by pretending everything is just a game. He is a hilarious character.I have a few problems with this movie, though. For one thing, it's incredibly historically inaccurate, but that doesn't really bother me that much, because the main point of the film does get across. My main concern with the movie, though, is how real Holocaust survivors actually feel about it. Unfortunately, most seem to think it's mocking them. They believe the movie makes everything that happened seem trivial and not as bad as it truly was. I hate to admit it, but, in a way, they are partially correct.Life is Beautiful does make the Holocaust become fiction, but, at the same time, it's simply a masterpiece. I've found it extremely hard to make up my mind about this movie.

What's next, a film masking the reality of rape? Anyone giving this film a good rating is seriously desensitized to the realities of genocide.There are plenty of other settings for the director to get his point across of offering hope to his son. Using the Holocaust in this manner is a disgrace. This is also a typical Hollywood film (I know its a foreign film) since it uses plenty of manipulative ploys to draw in an uncritical audience. This is Holocaust revisionism writ to celluloid. Have you ever seen a Holocaust survivor laughing and smiling like the idiot in this film.Putting the kid in the tank was beyond reprehensible. The irony of that scene juxtaposed against the concentration camps and the understanding that the German blitzkrieg is what initiated WWII must be lost on the director and most clueless, antiseptic viewers.This is the reality the film deliberately masks (then again maybe Benigni doesn't know it, doesn't want to know it, or doesn't believe it):""There was a sign `to disinfection.' He said `you see,they are bringing children now.' They opened the door, threw the children in and closed the door. There was a terrible cry.A member of the SS climbed on the roof. The people went on crying for about ten minutes. Then the prisoners opened the doors. Everything was in disorder and contorted.

By the time the first half was up I felt like it  was the happiest film I had ever seen.  Then came the dreadful second half  which takes place in a Nazi death camp.  Sure there is some extremely dark  humor in this last half but it reaked of &quot;Shindler's List&quot; and  the conclusion is not exactly uplifting either.

463602,A12LH2100CKQO,6305426651,God is a refuge for us (Psalms 62:8),"[8, 26]","I took a chance on this movie due to all of its good reviews and its star rating. After watching the trailer, I wasn't sure if I'd like it (but thought I'd take a chance anyway because of the reviews/rating).Well, if you think the trailer is kind of silly, then there is a lot more where that came from...the entire movie is like that. Silly, happy-go-lucky, always smiles, always laughter, impossible ""happy"" circumstances, silly talk, and more happy happy.Oh yes, it's 1939 and World War II is underway. But never mind that...just more happy happy. It even shows Jewish people taken by train to a camp...shows them wearing black/white striped clothing...but even then...more happy happy.After 15 minutes, I increased the speed of my DVD player to hurry-up the movie (still able to listen to the audio). After 30 minutes, I started to fast forward into the movie to see if it would get serious at all. Nope. At 1 hour into the movie (at the happy happy Jewish camp scene), I decided to turn it off.Maybe this movie is your cup of tea, but it is not for me. I did not find it cute, happy, or entertaining. It's just silliness. Given the era and what was occurring in history at that time, I thought the movie was insulting. I would not classify this movie as a war/military drama (although some websites do).Prior to renting (or buying it), I encourage you to watch the trailers.

463603,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,6305426651,Godly Gadfly,"[20, 24]","An Italian movie?  Worth watching?  If you are put off by the fact that this movie was produced in Italian, you'll miss the pleasure of seeing one of the most ""moving"" movies ever made.  And fortunately for us English-speaking folks, a version has been produced with English voices fluently dubbed over the original Italian.  You'll find that the power of this movie goes beyond languages and cultures.The setting is Italy, prior the Second World War; the protagonist Guido is a bumbling yet charming waiter.  With his Charlie Chaplin style charm, Guido attempts to seduce the pretty schoolteacher Dora, only to find she is already engaged.  In a comic sequences of events, he courts and wins his bride.  But this first half of the movie about romance is mere background, setting the emotional stage for the rest of the movie and the horror that follows.  After their marriage and an interlude of five years, it becomes evident that Guido is a Jew.  Along with his wife and son Giosue (Joshua), he is deported to a concentration camp.The structure reminds me of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", which in a similar manner is composed of two halves, the first half developing sympathy for a character and his family, and the second half placing this character in the cauldron of fiery trials and tragedy.  There are also similarities with the movie ""Titanic"" - a man falls in love with an engaged woman based on physical attraction, and after the conquest of their love they are together they are thrown into a horrific trial with a tragic conclusion.  But ""Life is Beautiful"" has a story far more ""titanic"" in its power and passion, and unlike the Hollywood blockbuster, it is genuine love based on self sacrfice rather than immoral passions.  Whatever suggestion there is of immorality (such as Guido's declaration that he desires to make love to her on the street) is presented absurdly and for humor, and is hardly intended to be taken seriously, unlike the steamy car scene in Titanic.  The very vague suggestion that they sleep together before marriage quickly fades behind the image of marital faithfulness, the wife's selfless devotion to her husband and family, and the self-sacrificing love of a husband and father.While the first half is very comic, the second half is very serious. Guido is desperate to protect young Joshua from the horror inflicted by the Germans, and so he pretends that the concentration camp is part of an elaborate game, with the first prize being a real tank.  He tries to keep up his son's spirits by ingeniously inventing this game, saying ""Isn't this fun?"" ""I've never had so much fun!""  ""It sure is fun!"" These repeated statements ring hollow in the middle of a concentration camp, and the illusion is hard to maintain when the boy says ""I just don't get this game"" and wants it to be over.  His father's reply ""This game is serious"" has more significance than he realizes.The first part of the movie features many memorable scenes of comedy: the belly-button classroom speech; the couple in deep conversation on the steps, he holding a steering wheel and she holding a pillow over her behind; a passionate kiss that occurs underneath the table; the green horse Prince Charming uses to rescue his princess; Guido's ""interpreting"" of the German guard's instruction.  But as comedy turns into tragedy, there are also memorable scenes of tragedy: the old Jew offering to help up the German who trips in the gas chambers; the irony of the German doctor who can help Guido but is obsessed with his riddles: ""You have to help me!""; and the boy's final vision of his father goose-stepping between the guards.The concluding hope (""We won! We won!"") is touched by tragedy.  By not being afraid to include sorrow, this tragic note makes the movie all the more emotional and successful.  I can think of few movies that have affected me as emotionally as this one.  Injecting a movie about the holocaust with comedy was taking a major risk, but ultimately made the movie all the more successful.  The height of comedy in the first half makes the depth of tragedy in the second half all the deeper.The PG-13 rating is primarily because of one instance of blasphemy, and a few war scenes.  Any adult themes that are present, however are not seen, but implied off-screen, including the actual horrors of the concentration camp.  Rather than dwell on the physical horrors of war through sensationalism, this movie focuses instead on the emotional impact.  It is especially the actor Roberto Benigni that makes this succeed.  As well as being the main actor, Roberto Benigni was also the writer and director of the movie.  In the half-hour featurette that is on the DVD, he acknowledges that the biggest influence on his acting was Charlie Chaplin.  Not does his slap-stick humour provide wonderful comic relief, but also emotion.  It's a brilliant performance that deservedly won him the Academy Award for Best Actor.But this film also took out the Academy Awards for best soundtrack - the classical music is a wonderful emotional counterpart to the storyline - and for the best foreign language film.  Over time, it has won a record of over 70 international awards.  After you watch it, you'll understand why.  It's a captivating picture of comedy and of survival and hope in the midst of horrific tragedy.  I can't think of a single movie that has ""moved"" me as this one has.  It may be Italian, but this is a movie not to be missed by people from anywhere around the world.",5,"You&#65533;ll laugh, you&#65533;ll cry: a truly moving movie.",1042588800,"01 15,

463604,A2BX9UPWBK2I8V,6305426651,Grahame R. Davis,"[11, 11]","Get this straight, folks.  This is not another Schindler's List, and it does not attempt to be. Schindler's List is an excellent film, but this is not another documentary picture on the Holocaust.  While it is a fable  based on events during the Second World War and the end is set in a  concentration camp, it is obviously only a movie and not based on real  life.  And who says that every movie made on a particular subject must be  the same?  Begnini has made a film that does not make light of the  Holocaust, but rather tells the tale of a man and his valiant attempts to  shield his son from the attrocities of this horrible war.  He knows what  his ultimate fate will likely be, but he can not bring himself to reveal  this to his little boy.The first half of this movie is simply  hilarious, with Begnini showing an incredible gift for physical comedy.  It  also serves as a great contrast to the second half of the picture, which is  serious and quite sad to watch.  The subject of the concentration camp is  not dealt with in complete accuracy, obviously, but there are a few scenes  which are easily as visually and emotionally powerful as those in any  documentary picture.One must remember that this is only a movie.  People go to the movies to see stories, and while some movies do attempt to  represent 100% accurate accounts of historical events, most take a more  liberal approach and simply use the historical informatoin upon which to  base a story of some degree of fiction.  In this respect, as a form of  entertainment, La Vita e Bella is a complete success.  It is a story of a  man who deals with terrible tragedy the way he has dealt with so many other  events in his life, by using humour. Those who say it trivializes the  Holocaust are missing the point, and must realise that this is only a  fable, and not a documentary.  It will make you laugh, it will make you  cry, and it WILL make you think.  As a piece of fictional entertainment, it  is a clear winner.",5,"Wonderful Movie, Exceptional Story.",955324800,"04 10, 2000",2000,1989,"['Get', 'straight', 'folks', 'not', 'Schindler', 'List', 'not', 'attempt', 'be', 'Schindler', 'List', 'excellent', 'film', 'not', 'documentary', 'picture', 'Holocaust', 'fable', 'based', 'events', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'end', 'set', 'concentration', 'camp', 'obviously', 'only', 'movie', 'not', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'who', 'movie', 'made', 'particular', 'subject', 'must', 'be', 'same', 'Begnini', 'made', 'film', 'not', 'make', 'light', 'Holocaust', 'rather', 'tale', 'man', 'valiant', 'attempts', 'shield', 'son', 'attrocities', 'horrible', 'war', 'what', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'reveal', 'little', 'boy.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'simply', 'hilarious', 'Begnini', 'showing', 'incredible', 'gift', 'physical', 'comedy', 'also', 'great', 'contrast', 'second', 'half', 'picture', 'serious', 'quite', 'sad', 'watch', 'subject', 'concentration', 'camp', 'not', 'dealt', 'complete', 'accuracy', 'obviously', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'easily', 'visually', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'documentary', 'picture.One', 'must', 'remember', 'only', 'movie', 'People', 'go', 'movies', 'see', 'stories', 'movies', 'do', 'attempt', 'represent', '100', '%', 'accurate', 'accounts', 'historical', 'events', 'most', 'take', 'more', 'liberal', 'approach', 'simply', 'use', 'historical', 'informatoin', 'base', 'story', 'degree', 'fiction', 'respect', 'form', 'entertainment', 'La', 'Vita', 'e', 'Bella', 'complete', 'success', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'way', 'dealt', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'events', 'life', 'using', 'humour', 'who', 'say', 'Holocaust', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'must', 'realise', 'only', 'fable', 'not', 'documentary', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'WILL', 'make', 'think', 'piece', 'fictional', 'entertainment', 'clear', 'winner']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

This story isn't quite your average WWII hideout plot, though.In this movie, Roberto Benigni, who plays a funny, romantic  father and husband, must cope with the effects of World War II, which has  changed his life forever. The movie, however, does not start out darkly- it  begins with Benigni romantically persuing a beautiful and kind woman, whom  he has fallen in love with. Benigni is very funny, and does wonders with  this role. His character uses wit and humor to gain the affection of his  object of affection, played by Nicoletta Braschi. Soon they start a family:  the two of them, with their young, innocent son.This is where things  take a turn for the worse. The War begins, and Benigni and his son are sent  off to a Nazi prison camp, where Jews and other people are being enslaved  and killed. Faced with having to explain this to his son, he turns the  entire situation into a pretend game, so as not to frighten his son. From  here things worsen- but throughout it all, Benigni tries to keep his son  happy, refusing to give up on life.This movie, while very tragic, is  also uplifting. It give us a better sense of the value of life when we  watch it, and it amuses us at the same time.

I was worried that I was interpreting a movie about the Holocaust incorrectly, but no, that was the intention of the film. Weird, right? Some people have found that disrespectful, but I thought the film was very well done. I must admit that I selected it randomly off the foreign language shelf in the library, wanting something new, and didn't even look at it that closely. I was therefore surprised at the abrupt change of pace in the middle of the movie. I enjoyed it a lot, though. I don't care that the beginning was silly. Why not have fun in life? The silliness in the second half was hard to get a grasp on, even knowing the father was doing it for the sake of his son. I think... if I was one of the men staying in the same shack as the two of them, I would have gotten fed up with that ""game"" pretty quickly. Well, probably immediately. Him shielding his son from the Nazis didn't strike me as unbelievable so much as a bunch of random prisoners not getting in the way of one man's game.

It demonstrated their wonderful integrity, particularly in the characters played by Begninni and Braschi.It is a refreshing look at the horrible experience of the Holocaust -- from the viewpoint of a person who DOES maintain his integrity and refuses to be beaten down, even to the moment of death. It was a story of the spirit winning over all attempts to destroy it.I think it's important to not forget what happened, but the way this movie was put together was uplifting, too.I don't normally watch movies that deal with real tragic material, because it can be just too upsetting to me, especially when children are involved.

It's about a Jewish fellow in pre-WWII Italy who falls in love with a rich Italian Christian noble.  They get married and live happily as WWII erupts.  Their little son Jozue grows up oblivious to the horrors of the day thanks to his wonderful parents.  Jozue's father is an eternal optimist and displays an incredible love for live and optimism even as he and little Jozue are being deported to the concentration camp just before the arrival and liberation of the allies. His mother shows no less courage and love as she voluntarily steps on to the ""death train"" heading for the same camp as her husband and son.  The film has a bitter sweet ending, but is an incredible production and a must see.

It's a seamless account of a man blessed with the ability to laugh at everything and not take himself nor, for that matter, anyone or anything else, very seriously. It's that trait which endears Guido (Roberto Benigni) even to Benigni's critics at the start of the film. In fact it's this gift of humor that allows him to foil a fascist school administrator, confound an imperious public official, befriend a German doctor and win the girl, played by Benigni's real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi.As so often happens in life, just when things are looking up, the world closes in on Guido and his family. They wind up in a Nazi concentration camp, where Guido spends all of his energy trying to shield his young son from the realities of their existence. He tells him, it's all a game and that the winner gets a life sized tank to take home. The rest is a tale of a father's love that translates into self sacrifice for his son.As he (the son/survivor) narrates at the start, ""This is a very simple story, but a difficult one to tell.""

463629,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6305426651,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[8, 10]","Life is Beautiful is a film by Roberto Benigni, which really showcases his talent before he made an embarassing stab at playing Pinocchio. ""Life is Beautiful"" is probably my favorite Foreign film (I've only seen probably 5 though); It's funny, heartfelt, has wonderful performances, and is all around a joy to watch. It also happens to be a layered film, that goes in one direction before veering off into another but never losing it's charm. Benigni plays Guido, a waiter with a humorous streak. After Guido contantly stumbles into Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), he falls in love with her and the movie (with no warning) flashes forward a number of years. This first half of the film (which is a little over 50 minutes) is pretty much a romantic-comedy. The second half is quite different. In the second half, Guido and Dora (who now have a young son named Joshua) live in Italy which is overrun with Germans. Subsequently, Guido and Joshua are taken into a concentration camp; Dora also goes to the camp, but under different circumstances which are a bit unbelievable but still a nice part of the story. Anyway, Guido employs his quick-wit to keep his son from the horrors of the camp; Guido tells Josh that it's actually an elaborate game and that he must avoid being seen. If, at the end, he does everything he's told and racks up the most ""points"" he will get a tank. Benigni (who is also the co-writer and director) does something that's never been done. He takes a horrifying setting (a concentration camp) and turns it into a comedy, without exploting anything and without losing heart.The film takes a sad turn in the end, which I think adds to it's realism. If it had a completely happy ending, I don't think it would work as well. Even if you're not a person who watches foreign film, this is an absolute masterpiece and to not see this film would be a mistake. This is a wonderful film, with Benigni (who I think is the first person to win an Oscar for Best Actor for a foreign language film, although I could be wrong) giving an absolutely delightful performance. I really don't see how someone could not enjoy this film.GRADE: A",5,A Wonderful Film,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2137,"['Life', 'Beautiful', 'film', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'really', 'talent', 'made', 'embarassing', 'stab', 'playing', 'Pinocchio', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'probably', 'favorite', 'Foreign', 'film', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'probably', '5', 'funny', 'heartfelt', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'joy', 'watch', 'also', 'be', 'layered', 'film', 'one', 'direction', 'veering', 'off', 'never', 'losing', 'charm', 'Benigni', 'Guido', 'waiter', 'humorous', 'streak', 'Guido', 'contantly', 'Dora', 'Nicoletta', 'Braschi', 'love', 'movie', 'warning', 'forward', 'number', 'years', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'little', '50', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'much', 'romantic-comedy', 'second', 'half', 'quite', 'different', 'second', 'half', 'Guido', 'Dora', 'who', 'now', 'have', 'young', 'son', 'named', 'Joshua', 'live', 'Italy', 'overrun', 'Germans', 'Subsequently', 'Guido', 'Joshua', 'are', 'taken', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Dora', 'also', 'camp', 'different', 'circumstances', 'are', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'still', 'nice', 'part', 'story', 'Anyway', 'Guido', 'quick-wit', 'keep', 'son', 'horrors', 'camp', 'Guido', 'Josh', 'actually', 'elaborate', 'game', 'must', 'avoid', 'being', 'seen', 'end', 'everything', 'told', 'up', 'most', 'points', 'will', 'get', 'tank', 'Benigni', 'who', 'also', 'co-writer', 'director', 'something', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'horrifying', 'setting', 'concentration', 'camp', 'comedy', 'exploting', 'anything', 'losing', 'heart.The', 'film', 'sad', 'turn', 'end', 'think', 'realism', 'had', 'completely', 'happy', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'person', 'who', 'foreign', 'film', 'absolute', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Benigni', 'who', 'think', 'first', 'person', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'giving', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'performance', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'could', 'not', 'enjoy', 'film.GRADE']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

Roberto Benigni and Nicoletta Braschi plays are really breathtaking... but how to forget that wonderful kid called Giorgio Cantarini (Giosue on the movie)This story tells the nice and quite life of a Jewish man (Guido) who falls in love with a beautiful school teacher (Dora). His permanent and occurrent humor sense and persistence gets Dora's heart... movie goes softly with many humoristic scenes and situations. Some years later, Giosue appears in scene, having Guido and Dora already married. The unexpected comes with a Nazi guard arrives to this happy family. Guido and his very young child are taken by the force to a Nazi death camp. Dora's love is stronger than anything and she leaves everything to join her family at the same hell.Then, the most dramatic (and unforgettable) situations are shown. Guido makes everything to make Giosue believe they are part of a game which will give to the winner a tank car. Even when Guido finishes his extremely-hard working days, he's still smily and full of imagination to make this white lie bigger. Although Guido's duties, he manages to get his sweetheart a love message, an operah play that Dora attented when they weren't together.After many situations, Guido knows the war is finishing and hides his little boy from Nazis soldiers. He tries to rescue his wife but he's caught by a soldier... who has no mercy with him. After some silent moments, Giosue comes out and he realizes is in front of the game winner's price... a real tank car.

I had absolutely no idea that it'll leave me sobbing after all the laughters I've had by watching it.Guido, lives in Italy and he's a remarkable man with great sense of humour. He meets his principesa by accident and soon she becomes his wife and gives birth to a very bright boy. Then the bloody Nazis show up - Guido and his son are taken away in the camps and then Guido's wife joins their fate too but she's kept seperate from them.Guido is a very caring father to his son and from the very beginning he keeps telling him that this is only a game so he wouldn't get scared from this absurd but most of all so his son couldn't get killed by damned Nazis.I've probably seen hundreds of movies on Jews sufferings. I must have read hundreds of books too - sad ones that would break my heart into zillion pieces but only after I've watched this movie I realised that I lacked the 100% sympathy to Jews for what they've gone through from sadistic Nazis.

463645,A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK,6305426651,"Kurt Harding ""bon vivant""","[3, 4]","I never saw Life is Beautiful when it first came out but always meant to when I found time. However, in the years since its release, I had quite forgotten about it until something I read recently rekindled my desire to view it. So I looked it up here, bought it, and enjoyed it several times.The idea of a Holocaust comedy is intriguing and I sure wanted to see how something like that could be done tastefully. This film shows how that can be done.Roberto Benigni is magnificent as Guido, a man who has such a cheerful outlook on life that very little can faze him for long. The film begins with Guido and a friend barreling down a twisting highway seemingly out of control in a car with failed brakes. They come into a town where a crowd lines the road awaiting the motorcade of the king and queen, not fascist officials as one reviewer said. As Guido frantically waves them aside, they think he is the king saluting and they salute him in return, and are still doing so when the real motorcade arrives with the impatient-looking royal couple inside. And the comedy continues...I won't rehash the entire movie, others have done so, but suffice to say that Guido is such an irrepressible guy that he finds it within himself to have an outwardly positive attitude about everything even when all seems hopeless.To me, the key parts of the film are:1) The way in which he courts the beautiful Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) and persists even when it looks as though she seems almost sure to be wed to a wealthy and debonair childhood friend. How he snatches her from under that stuffed shirt's nose is hilarious.2) The way he reacts to the anti-Semitism lite of fascist society. He keeps his head up, a smile on his face and tries to brush it off. When his young son Joshua, played by Giorgio Cantarini, asks about a sign on a shop that forbids entry to dogs and Jews, Guido deflects the emotional blow by joking that everyone has his own dislikes and that down the street there are other shops forbidding entry to other groups. So, since he (Guido) doesn't like Visigoths and his son doesn't like spiders, they will post a sign in their bookstore forbidding entry to Visigoths and spiders!3)When Germans occupy part of Italy toward the end of the war, the soft anti-Semitism of Mussolini's regime gives way to the hard-core anti-Semitism of the Nazis. The town's Jews, Guido and Joshua among them, are rounded up and shipped out to a labor camp. When Dora informs the German commander that there must be a mistake, he looks at his list, sees that Guido and Joshua are Jews, and assures her there is no mistake at all and suggests she go home. She demands to be shipped out as well and is granted her wish.In the camp, Guido has to use all his powers of persuasion and imagination to keep the truth of their predicament from his son. He tells the doubting boy that they are in an elaborate contest to win a tank, and if he remains undiscovered, he will accrue the thousand points needed to win. How he manages to keep his son from being detected and how he keeps his spirits up, even when worry and apprehension lie just beneath his upbeat facade, is a wonder to see. His seeming optimism in the face of looming disaster even helps his fellow captives grimly endure. I don't want to give it all away, so it will suffice to say that Guido is ever the jokester to the end.We've all heard the expression ""If life gives you lemons, make lemonade."". Well, Life Is Beautiful is a prime example of someone doing just that. And while we all can't be happy-go-lucky types, that is the trait that let Guido carry on in what would be an untenable situation for most people. And that is the trait that helped him help his son live to see a new dawn.All the lead characters give excellent performances, especially Benigni. The German characters are largely stereotypically sneering and bossy hate-filled Nazis, about the only sympathetic one being the camp doctor. There are a few scenes that are literally not credible, but even with these the movie is well worth seeing for the lessons it imparts and for the warm feelings you have at the end.",5,If Life Gives You Lemons...,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,4124,"['never', 'saw', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'always', 'meant', 'when', 'found', 'time', 'However', 'years', 'release', 'had', 'quite', 'forgotten', 'something', 'read', 'recently', 'rekindled', 'desire', 'view', 'looked', 'up', 'here', 'bought', 'enjoyed', 'several', 'times.The', 'idea', 'Holocaust', 'comedy', 'intriguing', 'sure', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'tastefully', 'film', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'done.Roberto', 'Benigni', 'magnificent', 'Guido', 'man', 'who', 'cheerful', 'outlook', 'life', 'very', 'little', 'can', 'faze', 'long', 'film', 'Guido', 'friend', 'barreling', 'down', 'twisting', 'highway', 'seemingly', 'control', 'car', 'failed', 'brakes', 'come', 'town', 'where', 'crowd', 'lines', 'road', 'awaiting', 'motorcade', 'king', 'queen', 'not', 'fascist', 'officials', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'Guido', 'frantically', 'aside', 'think', 'king', 'saluting', 'salute', 'return', 'are', 'still', 'doing', 'so', 'when', 'real', 'motorcade', 'impatient-looking', 'royal', 'couple', 'inside', 'comedy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'entire', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'suffice', 'say', 'Guido', 'such', 'irrepressible', 'guy', 'have', 'outwardly', 'positive', 'attitude', 'everything', 'even', 'when', 'hopeless.To', 'key', 'parts', 'film', 'are:1', 'way', 'beautiful', 'Dora', 'Nicoletta', 'Braschi', 'persists', 'even', 'when', 'almost', 'sure', 'be', 'wed', 'wealthy', 'debonair', 'childhood', 'friend', 'How', 'stuffed', 'shirt', 'nose', 'hilarious.2', 'way', 'anti-Semitism', 'lite', 'fascist', 'society', 'head', 'up', 'smile', 'face', 'tries', 'brush', 'off', 'When', 'young', 'son', 'Joshua', 'played', 'Giorgio', 'Cantarini', 'sign', 'shop', 'entry', 'dogs', 'Jews', 'Guido', 'emotional', 'blow', 'joking', 'everyone', 'own', 'dislikes', 'down', 'street', 'are', 'other', 'shops', 'forbidding', 'entry', 'other', 'groups', 'So', 'Guido', ""n't"", 'like', 'Visigoths', 'son', ""n't"", 'like', 'spiders', 'will', 'post', 'sign', 'bookstore', 'forbidding', 'entry', 'Visigoths', 'spiders', '3', 'When', 'Germans', 'occupy', 'part', 'Italy', 'end', 'war', 'soft', 'anti-Semitism', 'Mussolini', 'regime', 'way', 'hard-core', 'anti-Semitism', 'Nazis', 'town', 'Jews', 'Guido', 'Joshua', 'are', 'rounded', 'up', 'shipped', 'out', 'labor', 'camp', 'When', 'Dora', 'German', 'commander', 'must', 'be', 'mistake', 'list', 'Guido', 'Joshua', 'are', 'Jews', 'mistake', 'go', 'home', 'be', 'shipped', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'granted', 'wish.In', 'camp', 'Guido', 'use', 'powers', 'persuasion', 'imagination', 'keep', 'truth', 'predicament', 'son', 'doubting', 'boy', 'are', 'elaborate', 'contest', 'win', 'tank', 'undiscovered', 'will', 'accrue', 'thousand', 'points', 'needed', 'win', 'How', 'keep', 'son', 'being', 'detected', 'how', 'spirits', 'up', 'even', 'when', 'worry', 'apprehension', 'lie', 'just', 'beneath', 'upbeat', 'facade', 'wonder', 'see', 'seeming', 'optimism', 'face', 'looming', 'disaster', 'even', 'fellow', 'captives', 'grimly', 'endure', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'will', 'suffice', 'say', 'Guido', 'ever', 'jokester', 'end.We', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'expression', 'life', 'lemons', 'make', 'lemonade.', 'Well', 'Life', 'Is', 'Beautiful', 'prime', 'example', 'someone', 'doing', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy-go-lucky', 'types', 'trait', 'let', 'Guido', 'carry', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'untenable', 'situation', 'most', 'people', 'trait', 'helped', 'help', 'son', 'live', 'see', 'new', 'dawn.All', 'lead', 'characters', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'especially', 'Benigni', 'German', 'characters', 'are', 'largely', 'stereotypically', 'sneering', 'bossy', 'hate-filled', 'Nazis', 'only', 'sympathetic', 'one', 'being', 'camp', 'doctor', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'literally', 'not', 'credible', 'even', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'lessons', 'warm', 'feelings', 'have', 'end']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

Totally inventive in concept, the story revolves around an exuberant and romantic Italian man named Guido, who also happens to be Jewish. He sweeps the woman of his dreams,his ""Principessa"", off her feet. They marry and have an adorable little boy whom they dearly love. Unfortunately, this all happens during World War II in fascist Italy.Ultimately, Guido and their son are whisked away to a concentration/work camp on their young son's birthday. Meanwhile, his wife and the boy's mother, coming home and expecting to find a birthday celebration in progress, discovers, instead, that the inevitable has occurred. She tracks them down to the train that is taking prisoners to a work camp and, after confirming that they are on board, insists upon boarding the train herself, so that she may remain close to them. They see her board the train and know that she is with them.In order to get his son through this horror as best he can, Guido tells his son that they are involved in a real life game to win a tank, knowing that the boy had wanted a toy tank for his birthday. Talk about a reality survival game! In any case, his son is young enough to fall for it and gets with the program as only the very young can. What follows is a series of inventive scenarios which tells the viewer of the lengths that the father goes in order to keep his son quiet, obedient, entertained, and safe from harm. All along, the father has his son believing in the game and playing to win, to the point that the boy believes that they are actually in first place to win the tank.While this may sound like an odd venue in which to find oneself laughing, that is exactly what the viewer does. At the same time, the film is achingly poignant, and the end is infinitely sad. Guido is played to perfection by comedic star and filmmaker Roberto Benigni, who also directed this masterpiece. His on screen wife and comedic foil is played by his real life main squeeze, Nicoletta Braschi. The son is played with wondrous innocence by the totally adorable Giorgio Cantarini. This is an award caliber film that saw Benigni deservedly capture Oscars for Best Actor and Best Foreign Language Film.All in all, this film will leave the viewer both laughing and crying.

Its about the holocaust.The story opens in 1939 and the first half is a rollicking comedy of how Guido (played brilliantly by Robert Bernigni) woos and wins his wife.  He is a natural clown and his gift is quick thinking, fantastic timing, and outrageous acts.  He's lovable and optimistic and full of energy and life. However, he is Jewish at a time when Jews are being sent to death camps and he and his 5 year old son are rounded up.  His wife insists on following and she is sent to the women's part of the camp.  Guido wants to protect his son from the horrors of the camp and so, in his special inventive way, he spontaneously makes up elaborate inventive stories that are masterpieces of creativity.  The audience smiles through their tears as again and again Guido saves his son and gets messages of hope through to his wife, using his gift for comedy and natural joy for life in spite of the most gruesome of conditions.I laughed, I cried and sat at the edge of my seat as I watched this video which is a celebration of the human spirit in the worst kind of circumstances.  The acting is fantastic, the direction great and the plot moves with the speed of light bringing the audience though an emotional roller coaster.  This is a serious film with an important theme and is extremely painful film to watch.  However, I have nothing but the highest praise for the filmmakers who dared to bring this epic tale of love and the human spirit to the screen.

Set in 1930s Italy, the film opens as a slapstick comedy, with the rubber-faced Benigni (who won the Academy Award as Best Actor for this role) playing Guido Orifice, a hyperactive clown, as he repeatedly surprises a beautiful young woman, acts as the clever hotel waiter, and attempts to exchange hats with men he meets.Despite the frantic comedy, however, the fascist dictatorship and the growing anti-semitism loom constantly in the background, as Guido's uncle (Giustino Durano) is assaulted, his horse is painted green, and a local school principal talks about getting rid of defectives.  After a lovely segue to represent the passage of six years or so, we again see Guido, now married to his beautiful Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), and meet Giosue Orifice, his son, winningly played by six-year-old Giorgio Cantorini.  Totally committed to protecting his son from the horrors of anti-semitism, Giorgio turns everything into a joke.When the family is eventually rounded up and shipped to a concentration camp, Guido turns the event into a ""birthday surprise"" for Giosue and tries to ensure his survival by pretending that all the events are part of a huge game, with the winner getting a full-sized tank. Disappearances from the camp are explained as people dropping out of the game.In some ways, Guido's game-playing sets the reality of the concentration camps into sharp relief, intensifying the horror by showing the lengths to which a father will go to protect the innocence of his child.  The viewer knows that the game is a pitiful, and ultimately hopeless, attempt to hold back the reality of the Final Solution but cannot help hoping that against all odds, somehow Guido and Giosue will win.  The horrors of the Holocaust are obvious here, and the ironies of seeing both Guido and his captors all playing some sort of macabre ""game"" will not be lost on the viewer.I thoroughly enjoyed Benigni's pratfalls, his touching attention to his family, the music (by Nicola Piovani, which also won an Academy Award), and the cleverness of the plot.  But I also found that my realistic knowledge of the Holocaust was so overwhelming I could not ""suspend [my] disbelief,"" and I was unable to appreciate the film as the wonder-filled ""fable"" Benigni intended.

463659,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305426651,Matthew Horner,"[5, 7]","When I read several years ago that one of Italy's favorite comedic actors planned to make a comedy about the holocaust, I was appalled. That's what I get for believing everything I read. Life is Beautiful isn't a comedy. Director and star Roberto Benigni has taken what is, in fact, a grim subject, and, in typically Italian fashion, has infused it with a marvelous lust for life. He shows the remarkable abilities many people have to adopt to any situation and to get through it with dignity and humor. And, above all, he shows the remarkable lengths a parent will go to in order to protect a child - not just from physical harm, but from mental and spiritual harm as well.This is a simple story full of the richest of characters. Guido [Benigni] is a young man who is always aware of the wonder of being alive. He can take the most mundane events and turn them into wondrous fantasies. He comes up with the most remarkable ideas for diffusing any bad situation. He is the hopeless romantic.When he moves to a small town, he immediately meets the love of his life. She is Dora [Nicoletta Braschi], the school teacher daughter of a rich, snobbish woman. Guido woos her, and she is captivated by him. Her mother has arranged for her to marry an oafish town official, but Guido has a wealth of funny tricks up his sleeve that aid him in winning her. In the beginning, theirs is a storybook romance, but soon, they encounter an obstacle that even the resourceful Guido cannot overcome, though he tries mightily. Their love affair begins in 1939, when Fascist Italy is in an evil alliance with Nazi Germany. Guido is a Jew. Fate is about to play its hand.By the time Guido and Dora's son, Giosue, is four years old, the Nazi have arrived to send Guido to a concentration camp. Guido and Giosue are arrested suddenly and placed on a train filled with other prisoners. When Dora, who is Catholic, learns of their plight, she rushes to the train station, and, in one of the most poignant scenes in movie history, she demands that the commandant put her aboard it.How can Guido protect his child's mind from the horror that is to follow? That is the heart and soul of Life is Beautiful. Guido shows incredible ingenuity, and, for the most part, Giosue believes him. At times, he just pretends to, because Guido is so full of life, love and humor. His is an infectious personality.The best label for Life is Beautiful is tragicomedy. You take the bitter with the sweet. You appreciate the gift of life. You do your best to see that, no matter what tragedy strikes, the young are preserved for a hopefully brighter future. All of these things are so hard to do, yet Guido makes them seem so simple.Recently, Miramax Films went to great lengths to make a dubbed version of the movie. This is the version I reviewed. While I know subtitles are a nuisance, dubbing often robs a film of the inflections actors try so hard to put into their words. The new language can add an unintended flatness to the dialog. This problem is not so noticeable in Life is Beautiful, and it opens the movie up to the many people who otherwise might avoid it.The movie won Oscars for Best Foreign Film, Best Actor [Benigni] and Best Dramatic Score.",5,One of my Top Ten of 1998,1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,3215,"['When', 'read', 'several', 'years', 'one', 'Italy', 'favorite', 'comedic', 'actors', 'planned', 'make', 'comedy', 'holocaust', 'was', 'appalled', 'what', 'get', 'believing', 'everything', 'read', 'Life', 'Beautiful', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'Director', 'star', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'taken', 'what', 'fact', 'grim', 'subject', 'typically', 'Italian', 'fashion', 'infused', 'marvelous', 'lust', 'life', 'remarkable', 'abilities', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'adopt', 'situation', 'get', 'dignity', 'humor', 'remarkable', 'lengths', 'parent', 'will', 'go', 'order', 'protect', 'child', 'not', 'just', 'physical', 'harm', 'mental', 'spiritual', 'harm', 'well.This', 'simple', 'story', 'full', 'richest', 'characters', 'Guido', '[', 'Benigni', ']', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'aware', 'wonder', 'being', 'alive', 'can', 'take', 'most', 'mundane', 'events', 'turn', 'wondrous', 'fantasies', 'up', 'most', 'remarkable', 'ideas', 'diffusing', 'bad', 'situation', 'hopeless', 'romantic.When', 'small', 'town', 'immediately', 'love', 'life', 'Dora', '[', 'Nicoletta', 'Braschi', ']', 'school', 'teacher', 'daughter', 'rich', 'snobbish', 'woman', 'Guido', 'woos', 'captivated', 'mother', 'arranged', 'marry', 'oafish', 'town', 'official', 'Guido', 'wealth', 'funny', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeve', 'aid', 'winning', 'beginning', 'storybook', 'romance', 'soon', 'encounter', 'obstacle', 'even', 'resourceful', 'Guido', 'can', 'not', 'overcome', 'mightily', 'love', 'affair', '1939', 'when', 'Fascist', 'Italy', 'evil', 'alliance', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Guido', 'Jew', 'Fate', 'play', 'time', 'Guido', 'Dora', 'son', 'Giosue', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'Nazi', 'have', 'arrived', 'send', 'Guido', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Guido', 'Giosue', 'are', 'arrested', 'suddenly', 'placed', 'train', 'filled', 'other', 'prisoners', 'When', 'Dora', 'who', 'Catholic', 'learns', 'plight', 'train', 'station', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'movie', 'history', 'commandant', 'put', 'aboard', 'it.How', 'can', 'Guido', 'protect', 'child', 'mind', 'horror', 'follow', 'heart', 'soul', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'Guido', 'incredible', 'ingenuity', 'most', 'part', 'Giosue', 'times', 'just', 'Guido', 'so', 'full', 'life', 'love', 'humor', 'infectious', 'personality.The', 'best', 'label', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'tragicomedy', 'take', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'appreciate', 'gift', 'life', 'do', 'best', 'see', 'matter', 'what', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'young', 'are', 'preserved', 'hopefully', 'brighter', 'future', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'hard', 'do', 'yet', 'Guido', 'seem', 'so', 'simple.Recently', 'Miramax', 'Films', 'went', 'great', 'lengths', 'make', 'dubbed', 'version', 'movie', 'version', 'reviewed', 'know', 'subtitles', 'are', 'nuisance', 'dubbing', 'often', 'film', 'inflections', 'actors', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'put', 'words', 'new', 'language', 'can', 'add', 'unintended', 'flatness', 'dialog', 'problem', 'not', 'so', 'noticeable', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'movie', 'up', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'otherwise', 'might', 'avoid', 'it.The', 'movie', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Best', 'Actor', '[', 'Benigni', ']', 'Best', 'Dramatic', 'Score']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

You see, in this film, Roberto Begninni walks that fine line  between the exploitation of a tragedy (the Holocaust), and making a  comedic, touching movie. This is something that movies like American  Beauty,Forrest Gump, and Primary Colors, failed to do. They all took human  tragedies and tried to be clever with them (patricide,mental &amp; physical  disabilities and corruption respectively),unsuccessfully. Life is Beautiful  takes as important a subject, if not more so, and makes an incredibly  entertaining, and never demeaning film. The way that the father protects  his son from not only the German hostilities, but the mental anguish of the  holocaust by creating a game is a stroke of genius! It is also a touching  story of true love that cannot be separated, and a friends betrayal. Is  there a sadder moment in cinema than when Begninni is approached by an old  friend, now a German officer, who thinks is about to help his family escape  the concentration camp in whic they are imprisoned, but instead only wants  answers to a puzzle? (long stroy, rent the film!)Even the climax, when the  Americans liberate the camp and Begninni's character is killed, you never  see his death, you only hear the shot! Beautiful!

Guido's (Roberto Begnini) car breaks down and he meets Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) at her family farm.  For him it's love at first sight but he will never see his ""princi pessa"" again.  He continues to Rome to work for his uncle as a waiter.  And who does he run into, Dora.  He sees Dora again at the restaurant.  The only problem is it's her engagement party.  This does not deter Guido and he pursues her and eventually wins her love.Five year passes and Guido and Dora are deliriously happy and they have a son.  The only problem is WWII and Italy's alliance with Germany.  Fascism and anti-Semitism are in full swing.  Guido does everything to protect his son from this.  But eventually, it becomes too real and he and his son are deported to a concentration camp.  Dora, who is Catholic, will not let her two men go alone and she goes with them.  (This is where I have a small issue, as she is Catholic, the boy would have been raised Catholic and I don't think the church would have let the boy be deported).They arrive at the camp and the Guido and his son are separated from Dora.  Guido is warned not the let the boy leave the barracks.  Guido tells the boy that this is a game and tells him the rules, including that the winner gets a tank (This is a hilarious scene.)  Guido does everything to shield the boy from the reality.  Eventually, the Americans liberate the camp.The one thing that I hated about the film was the ending but this film cannot have a truly satisfying ending.  Therefore, you have to live with the ending.As I stated at the beginning, this is a fantasy.  The second half of the film could never happen but this is a film about love and you must look at the film from this point of view.  The moral is that with love anything can be accomplished and that is why Life is Beautiful.  This is a great film and must be seen by everyone.Note: I have only seen the subtitled version and have been told that the dubbed is not as good but still is excellent.DVD EXTRA:  Making Life Beautiful - A 23 minute making of featurette with interviews with stars Roberto Begnini and Nicoletta Braschi and actors Walter Matthau (costar of Little Devil) and Michael Keaton.

Life is Beautiful will do so from beginning to end. Benigni is a motor-mouthed genius, the script and screen play devilishly inventive and impishly funny all the way along.It's certainly no flat-out rib-tickler: The experiences of a Jewish Italian waiter and his family in a concentration camp could hardly be wall to wall slapstick. (Well, in Mel Brooks' capable hands, maybe - but Benigni has bigger fish to fry than Mel Brooks ever did.)HOWEVER, I was not so taken with the Holocaust element. For one thing, the film is deliberately surreal and derives much of its humour from patently improbable situations: Benigni's character, a lovable wag, spends the entire film getting away with things which would throw any mortal into hospital, jail or a santitorium.  So there's inevitably an element of Hogan's Heroes about the Concentration Camp scenes. This is fine on the comedy level, of course, but it does undermine any more serious a points Benigni might be trying to make. And Life is Beautiful unquestionably does stoop to collect some cheap gravitas.[Warning: Controversial View coming up:]As an exercise in harrowing film-making, depicting the Holocaust is easy pickings. You don't need to be Spielberg or Polanksi to create an emotional wrecking-ball out of Dachau: the Nazis did that by themselves. You only have to have seen ""The World At War"" to realise that pure reportage of the Holocaust is horrifying enough without any dramatic push.And, like it or not, Benigni does collect on this front.  I don't think that detracts from the excellence of this film - which is, after all about what a father will do for his family - but I think it considerably skews the Deep & Meaningful Index readout.Which is to say is that Life is Beautiful is a standout piece of cinema because of its wit, not because of its treatment of the Holocaust.

I have not even read the other amazon.com reviews before doing this one.If you dislike Holocaust movies per se, still see this movie. This is a story about living life and loving.  Guido is the epitome of a true man.  He is a little goofy, but endearing.  At first I put up with his antics, but as the movie progressed, Benigni (Guido) had me wishing I was his princepessa.  He loved Dora with a passion that I've rarely seen in life.  He consistently refused to live life at a low level, no matter what the circumstance.  He refused to bow to any circumstance or public opinion that made him feel less than a prince.  Principe Guido!He seemed to glide through life with his wit and optimism.  He refused to be offended by racism, and protected his loved ones by making light of racist attacks.  His humor and creativity shielded his son through the concentration camp experience, all the way to the end.  He was a winner...an overcomer.  He gave this great gift of winning to his son, whose innocence was intact to the end.You start out the movie thinking Guido's a goofball, and end up realizing that he is a man among men.  That is the charm of the movie, that you become attached to them as though you know them.This movie is about a horrible event, but will make your spirit soar.

463686,A23VBURIWZPRR2,6305426651,purplehaloz,"[2, 3]","Life Is Beautiful is an extraordinarily significant work of art. Screenwriter/Director/Actor Roberto Benigni takes Tragicomedy to new heights, even as he pays tribute to the finest work of Charles Chaplin. Benigni plays Guido, an Italian Jew whose ethnicity is suddenly and shockingly targeted by the Nazis at a time when he is growing a young family- after having, literally, fallen upon the ""Princesa,"" the woman of his dreams- as well as a fine bookstore.A genuinely happy, warm and charming person, Guido, along with millions of other Jewish people, is now beset by woes of almost horrificaly unimaginable proportions as he and his little boy are taken away by the Nazis to a concentration camp. His intent, no matter what may follow and above all else except keeping his child physically alive in Auschwitz, a place and time where Jewish children were systematically gassed and killed, is to protect the innocence of his young son by pretending the whole horror is a game, the end of which, if he plays right, is to win a tank.Guido's wife, who is not Jewish and not sent on the train, insists on accompanying the rest of her family, husband and son, to Auschwitz, much to the surprise of the Nazi soldier at the train station; her life is her loved ones, something he does not understand.The strikingly beautiful cinematography- including exceptionally rich use of color, choice of camera shots and movement, set- and costume design-, editing, stirring musical score and fine surrealistic touch reminiscent of Fellini, make this film enjoyable and poetic in a visual sense, because there is rhyme and reason to each decision made by Benigni as screenwriter and director, as they blend with the dialogue, acting, story and theme to create a finely crafted, richly inspired, tragicomic masterpiece that brings forth tears of abject sadness amid the light of Guido's sense of play and fatherly protection- ""You always did want to go on a trip,"" he softly tells his little boy as they are carted off in the death train amid the foreboding musical passage that accompanies this shot.This seems bizarre but it is only the beginning of this man's overwhelming desire to shield his beloved child from the pain of the reality that confonts their family. In fact this preparation was actually, in a sense, begun before that, when Josue playfully hid from his mother in a little cabinet to avoid taking his bath, with his father in collusion with the game, something that winds up saving him from the fake ""bath"" at the camp.The use of extreme close-ups is reserved by director-screenwriter Benigni for the most poignant point in the film, where a final wink from Guido to little Josue hiding in the cabinet places the seal on the reality of their game of survival and preservation of the child's innocence.Survival in the physical sense and also in the emotional or psychological sense is Guido's role as father/protector of his child. Other high cinematic/editing feats include those such as the skillful, unobstrusive change of time from the courting of his wife stage to the realization of their family they created, five years later,in one single shot. This makes clear the family/child they created is a direct result of the love they have for each other. Cinematic poetry is unfortunately a rare phenomenon on the big screen, so this one is a true gem. It should be watched in the original Italian, because the true voices of the characters that people this film belong to them and should be heard by all.",5,Protection of Innocence Amid the Horror,1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,3507,"['Life', 'Is', 'Beautiful', 'extraordinarily', 'significant', 'work', 'art', 'Screenwriter/Director/Actor', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'Tragicomedy', 'new', 'heights', 'even', 'tribute', 'finest', 'work', 'Charles', 'Chaplin', 'Benigni', 'Guido', 'Italian', 'Jew', 'ethnicity', 'suddenly', 'shockingly', 'targeted', 'Nazis', 'time', 'when', 'growing', 'young', 'family-', 'having', 'literally', 'fallen', 'Princesa', 'woman', 'dreams-', 'as', 'well', 'fine', 'bookstore.A', 'genuinely', 'happy', 'warm', 'charming', 'person', 'Guido', 'millions', 'other', 'Jewish', 'people', 'now', 'beset', 'woes', 'almost', 'horrificaly', 'unimaginable', 'proportions', 'little', 'boy', 'are', 'taken', 'away', 'Nazis', 'concentration', 'camp', 'intent', 'matter', 'what', 'may', 'follow', 'else', 'keeping', 'child', 'physically', 'alive', 'Auschwitz', 'place', 'time', 'where', 'Jewish', 'children', 'were', 'systematically', 'gassed', 'killed', 'protect', 'innocence', 'young', 'son', 'pretending', 'whole', 'horror', 'game', 'end', 'right', 'win', 'tank.Guido', 'wife', 'who', 'not', 'Jewish', 'not', 'sent', 'train', 'accompanying', 'rest', 'family', 'husband', 'son', 'Auschwitz', 'much', 'surprise', 'Nazi', 'soldier', 'train', 'station', 'life', 'loved', 'ones', 'something', 'not', 'understand.The', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'cinematography-', 'including', 'exceptionally', 'rich', 'use', 'color', 'choice', 'camera', 'shots', 'movement', 'set-', 'costume', 'design-', 'editing', 'stirring', 'musical', 'score', 'fine', 'surrealistic', 'touch', 'reminiscent', 'Fellini', 'make', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'poetic', 'visual', 'sense', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'decision', 'made', 'Benigni', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'blend', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'story', 'theme', 'create', 'finely', 'crafted', 'richly', 'inspired', 'tragicomic', 'masterpiece', 'forth', 'tears', 'abject', 'sadness', 'light', 'Guido', 'sense', 'play', 'fatherly', 'protection-', 'always', 'did', 'want', 'go', 'trip', 'softly', 'little', 'boy', 'are', 'carted', 'off', 'death', 'train', 'foreboding', 'musical', 'passage', 'shot.This', 'bizarre', 'only', 'beginning', 'man', 'overwhelming', 'desire', 'shield', 'beloved', 'child', 'pain', 'reality', 'family', 'fact', 'preparation', 'was', 'actually', 'sense', 'begun', 'when', 'Josue', 'playfully', 'mother', 'little', 'cabinet', 'avoid', 'taking', 'bath', 'father', 'collusion', 'game', 'something', 'up', 'saving', 'fake', 'bath', 'camp.The', 'use', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'reserved', 'director-screenwriter', 'Benigni', 'most', 'poignant', 'point', 'film', 'where', 'final', 'wink', 'Guido', 'little', 'Josue', 'hiding', 'cabinet', 'seal', 'reality', 'game', 'survival', 'preservation', 'child', 'innocence.Survival', 'physical', 'sense', 'also', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'sense', 'Guido', 'role', 'father/protector', 'child', 'Other', 'high', 'cinematic/editing', 'feats', 'include', 'such', 'skillful', 'unobstrusive', 'change', 'time', 'courting', 'wife', 'stage', 'realization', 'family', 'created', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'one', 'single', 'shot', 'clear', 'family/child', 'created', 'direct', 'result', 'love', 'have', 'other', 'Cinematic', 'poetry', 'unfortunately', 'rare', 'phenomenon', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'true', 'gem', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'original', 'Italian', 'true', 'voices', 'characters', 'people', 'film', 'belong', 'should', 'be', 'heard']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS
463687,AQGISDG8KML8W,6305426651,"Quaker Annie ""reader""","[20, 29]","The Holocaust has been a point of interest for me since my brief residency in Germany as a child in the late 50's, and I've read many books on the topic, basically trying to understand the meaning of life, and deal with  the knowledge that people can be so cruel to each other.Still, for  months, I'd avoided watching this movie. No doubt that reveals a bit too  much about me - I've always been one to cover my eyes at scary scenes in  movies (there's a scene in Dancing with Wolves that I never have seen and  don't intend to). I've never made it through the movie version of  Shindler's List, though I'd read the book - perhaps I don't need to watch  that one. This movie is quite different than Shindler's List, although it  teaches the same history.Watching the trailers for this movie made me  think it could not possibly be for me.  The idea of a child in a  concentration camp seemed the ultimate horror. How could such a movie be as  wonderful as reviewers were saying?  Eventually, through recommendations  from friends, I rented it, comforted by the knowledge that I could always  fast-forward it if it got too awful to watch.I didn't fast-forward over  this movie, but fell in love with the lead character and stuck with him to  the end.  Roberto Benigni makes you love Guido, and that love for him (and  his own love for his young son) draws you into this story that is based on  so many incredible stories of that time and place.On the surface, Guido  is a buffoon, a slapstick goofball, who falls in love with a beautiful  woman. His goofiness his really an expression of his love of life, his  humor, his willingness to take incredibly wild changes. These are the very  traits that win him the love of this woman, in an incredible scene as she  almost marries the wrong guy.

There is also something disturbing which is probably caused by a supposed disproportionate impact of Benigni's ego on the movie. And this does not seem to concern an aspiring (or even failing) artistic ego, I would say, but rather an exhibitionistic ego.This movie is imagination-driven and creatively and culturally interesting, but it is not uplifting.Maybe the core of my criticism of this movie is that the playful and daring and unlikely attitude Guido has towards his son (in the second part of the movie) in those existentially pressing circumstances, is that this attitude can only be approved or justified, I believe, if it works, that is: when it has the intended effect of appeasing the mind and heart of the son. In the movie it does have this effect and so the attitude could be approved (in the context of the movie). Yet, this attitude works precisely because the movie is a product of (Benigni's) imagination, it (only) works in a contrived imaginary world.So Benigni provided a context for an unlikely attitude to work. But to what avail?Also the portrayed or suggested braveness of Guido in the camp is unconvincing and hollow; this braveness could be sustained only because the reality in which Guido lives has been bended by Benigni into an unlikely artificial reality.I do think though, this movie does evoke an interesting question:Can the creation of subrealities for somebody else (and presenting it as real) be really helpful for that other?Admitting that this movie is creative and energetic, I ask:What does Benigni's creativity and imagination in this movie (intend to) serve apart from being merely entertaining?",2,Benigni's imagination is beautiful,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,1814,"['imagination', 'not', 'life.Please', 'skip', 'review', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'yet.I', 'found', 'movie', 'well-made', 'entertaining', 'also', 'contrived', 'unconvincing', 'also', 'something', 'disturbing', 'probably', 'caused', 'supposed', 'disproportionate', 'impact', 'Benigni', 'ego', 'movie', 'not', 'seem', 'concern', 'aspiring', 'even', 'failing', 'artistic', 'ego', 'would', 'say', 'rather', 'exhibitionistic', 'ego.This', 'movie', 'imagination-driven', 'creatively', 'culturally', 'interesting', 'not', 'uplifting.Maybe', 'core', 'criticism', 'movie', 'playful', 'daring', 'unlikely', 'attitude', 'Guido', 'towards', 'son', 'second', 'part', 'movie', 'existentially', 'pressing', 'circumstances', 'attitude', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'approved', 'justified', 'believe', 'when', 'intended', 'effect', 'appeasing', 'mind', 'heart', 'son', 'movie', 'have', 'effect', 'so', 'attitude', 'could', 'be', 'approved', 'context', 'movie', 'attitude', 'precisely', 'movie', 'product', 'Benigni', 'imagination', 'only', 'contrived', 'imaginary', 'world.So', 'Benigni', 'provided', 'context', 'unlikely', 'attitude', 'work', 'what', 'avail', 'Also', 'portrayed', 'suggested', 'braveness', 'Guido', 'camp', 'unconvincing', 'hollow', 'braveness', 'could', 'be', 'sustained', 'only', 'reality', 'Guido', 'been', 'bended', 'Benigni', 'unlikely', 'artificial', 'reality.I', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'evoke', 'interesting', 'question', 'Can', 'creation', 'subrealities', 'somebody', 'else', 'presenting', 'real', 'be', 'really', 'helpful', 'other', 'Admitting', 'movie', 'creative', 'energetic', 'ask', 'What', 'Benigni', 'creativity', 'imagination', 'movie', 'intend', 'serve', 'apart', 'being', 'merely', 'entertaining']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

The first half is a classic slapstick romance, the second half, a black comedy. These two link together, but the change of pace is  jarring and is signalled by the arrival of the main characters at a  concentration camp. I wondered how it could be possible to make a comedy of  the holocaust, and now I know - depict a fantasy rather than reality. The  film is 'unrealistic' in the extreme, but this only partly detracts from  the main message, that life and love are stronger than fear and death. I'm  not a person who laughs out loud at slapstick - and here yet another egg in  the hat routine bores me. But despite the sometimes formulaic pratfalls  this film has some comedic moments that are truly inspired. Benigni's  arrival at the town school to explain and inadvertantly debunk racial  superiority, for instance, or his impromptu 'translation' of the rules of  the concentration camp, are simultaneously hilarious and poignant. If  you're looking for a film about the holocaust, this isn't it. But if you're  looking for a great sentimental comedy with some fine moments, this is one  for you.

I'm not saying one can do that with the holocaust, so I don't want any one to misread what I'm saying here.What ever we go through in life, it may be possible to experience some things differently, just by the &#34;take&#34; or the perspective we have on what is going on around us.If someone says they hate you, they just haven't taken the time to get to know you.

It should have been obvious for anyone who followed both men that Jarmusch's humor is of a decidedly different sweep than is Benigni's. After all, Benigni released the silly, rather stupid Johnny Stecchino the same year Jarmusch released Night on Earth, with Benigni as one of the cab drivers. Where Jarmusch is intellectual, Benigni is slapstick, often painfully so.To Benigni's credit, La Vita e Bella is his best film. (By far.) He tones down the slapstick quite a bit, though he's as manic as ever. Here, he plays the kind of guy everyone knows, the inveterate liar who uses his talents for storytelling to try and make life better for everyone around him. He gets his big test during World War II; as he is Jewish, both he and his son are taken to a concentration camp, where he spends his time trying to convince his son that they're playing a game rather than trying to keep themselves alive in the face of Nazi oppression.It's impossible not to like the film, really. But I think much of the credit should go to the supporting cast rather than Benigni, who's as annoying as ever. (At least he's not playing with bananas this time a la Johnny Stecchino.) Everyone around him, rather than seeming grateful for his actions, seems to take them with an almost resigned amusement; in other words, every other actor in the movie is set up as a straight man for Benigni and his wild flights of fantasy. The effect is wonderful.There is much to be made of the light tone taken with the Holocaust, and the hundreds of coincidences throughout the latter half of the movie that would have made it impossible, but we must remember: this is Benigni. His character's wild flights of fantasy are nothing more than a mirror of Benigni's own wild flight of fantasy in the structure and content of the film itself. Still, the juxtaposition of manic comedy with the horrors of war (most starkly shown when Benigni gets lost in the fog after the dinner) does leave something of a bad aftertaste in the mouth.Overall, though, a good film. Worthy of the Oscar nominations? Maybe. Benigni winning Best Actor over Edward Norton in American History X?

463698,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,6305426651,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[5, 6]","Mixing humor and the Holocaust isn't anything new: Ernst Lubitsch's 'To Be Or Not To Be' is just one enduring classic; Mel Brooks' 'The Producers' is another; and 'Life Is Beautiful' has the small-town charm and ambiance of 'Amarcord,' and light-straight satire of 'The Great Dictator.'Set against the stark reality of World War II Europe, Roberto Benigni's sentimental fable is not a film about the Holocaust, it's a film about life and hope merely against the backdrop of the Holocaust... It's not a denial of the Holocaust, it is a manifestation that humor itself can be courage... It's not about betraying the experience of millions of Jews, it is about the great lengths a father will go to protect his family from the horrors of the Nazis... It's a demonstration of the power of cinema, it's art without claim, hope without fear, dreams without limitations... It's a motion picture about love, not a documentary about the Nazis... It delivers a powerful message that despite everything--life is truly beautiful...The story begins in 1939 Italy, where a simple, free-spirited Italian Jew Guido Orefice (Benigni) and his poet friend Ferrucio (Sergio Bini Bustic) have dreams of owning their own bookstore... For now, however, Guido must be satisfied to wait tables, while Ferrucio is unable to get a job...Benigni's character is introduced during a long set of fast comedy scenes, particularly when he meets a cute gentile woman, Dora--Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife... When she 'falls out of the sky,' and he quickly nicknames her 'Principessa'... When he rides, in a fascist ball, on a horse painted green... When he turns a gloomy rainy night into a red carpet event... When he is caught by the Nazis as he hurries about securing the safety of his wife and son.. When his car speeds, without brakes, through a village and is mistaken for a king...Guido falls hard for the radiant schoolteacher, daughter of a wealthy family, and pursues her with all the charm and imagination he can discharge... In one sequence he pretends to be a school inspector and gives an impromptu speech on racial superiority before the assembled students and teachers, ending with a striptease...That hilarious side of the film takes up the first half... Benigni (who also wrote and directed) borrows a bit of Chaplin's grace and a bit of Groucho Marx charm... All of the action is so neatly contrived that the film essentially ends when it's over, and then begins again with the introduction of Guido and Dora's cute five-year-old son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) few years later...There, in 1945, we catch a glimpse of their enchanting household, but things are soon shattered, and the Nazis take Guido, with his tolerant uncle (Giustino Durano) and little Giosue off to an unidentified concentration camp... Dora races to the train station and demands to be put also on the train...At the death camp, and in order to protect his son from the nightmare of the place, Guido uses his imagination by creating the illusion that everything that's happening is just a game, an epic game that will be exciting and fun...He convinces Giosue that by hiding from the Gestapo soldiers (whom he refers to simply as the ""men who yell a lot"") and maintaining silence, he can gain the necessary points to win a tank... Not a toy tank, but a full-size tank, which they'll be free to take home...As co-writer, Benigni (with Vincenzo Cerami), doesn't just mix drama and comedy, he often hides drama in the comedy... The film does not dwell on the horrors of the camp, nor does it ignore them...With a memorable score by Nicola Piovani, ""Life Is Beautiful"" is an important film, triumphant, timeless, and sublime... It manages to entertain, educate, and move with its potent combination of humor, poignancy, and dignity... Roberto Benigni has taken pure horror and turned it into a love story between a man and a woman, between a father and his son... As an actor, Benigni manages with his wise and simple performance to make us laugh in tragic situations... He was very realistic, natural, distant from great special effects, far from Hollywood style, only nice and beautiful cinema...The film won Academy Awards for Best Actor, Best Foreign Film and Best Dramatic Score...",4,"An important film, triumphant, timeless, and sublime...",1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,4251,"['Mixing', 'humor', 'Holocaust', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', ""'To"", 'Be', 'Not', 'Be', 'just', 'one', 'enduring', 'classic', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Producers', ""'Life"", 'Is', 'Beautiful', 'small-town', 'charm', 'ambiance', ""'Amarcord"", 'light-straight', 'satire', ""'The"", 'Great', 'Dictator', 'stark', 'reality', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Europe', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'sentimental', 'fable', 'not', 'film', 'Holocaust', 'film', 'life', 'hope', 'merely', 'backdrop', 'Holocaust', 'not', 'denial', 'Holocaust', 'manifestation', 'can', 'be', 'courage', 'not', 'betraying', 'experience', 'millions', 'Jews', 'great', 'father', 'will', 'go', 'protect', 'family', 'horrors', 'Nazis', 'demonstration', 'power', 'cinema', 'art', 'claim', 'hope', 'fear', 'dreams', 'limitations', 'motion', 'picture', 'love', 'not', 'documentary', 'Nazis', 'powerful', 'message', 'everything', 'life', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'story', '1939', 'Italy', 'where', 'simple', 'free-spirited', 'Italian', 'Jew', 'Guido', 'Orefice', 'Benigni', 'poet', 'friend', 'Ferrucio', 'Sergio', 'Bini', 'Bustic', 'have', 'dreams', 'owning', 'own', 'bookstore', 'now', 'however', 'Guido', 'must', 'be', 'satisfied', 'wait', 'tables', 'Ferrucio', 'unable', 'get', 'job', 'Benigni', 'character', 'introduced', 'long', 'set', 'fast', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'when', 'cute', 'gentile', 'woman', 'Dora', 'Nicoletta', 'Braschi', 'Benigni', 'real-life', 'wife', 'When', 'sky', 'quickly', 'When', 'fascist', 'ball', 'horse', 'painted', 'green', 'When', 'gloomy', 'rainy', 'night', 'red', 'carpet', 'event', 'When', 'caught', 'Nazis', 'securing', 'safety', 'wife', 'son..', 'When', 'car', 'speeds', 'brakes', 'village', 'mistaken', 'king', 'Guido', 'hard', 'radiant', 'schoolteacher', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'family', 'charm', 'imagination', 'can', 'discharge', 'one', 'sequence', 'be', 'school', 'inspector', 'impromptu', 'speech', 'racial', 'superiority', 'assembled', 'students', 'teachers', 'ending', 'striptease', 'hilarious', 'side', 'film', 'up', 'first', 'half', 'Benigni', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'bit', 'Chaplin', 'grace', 'bit', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'charm', 'action', 'so', 'neatly', 'contrived', 'film', 'essentially', 'when', 'then', 'again', 'introduction', 'Guido', 'Dora', 'cute', 'five-year-old', 'son', 'Giosue', 'Giorgio', 'Cantarini', 'few', 'years', 'later', '1945', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'enchanting', 'household', 'things', 'are', 'soon', 'shattered', 'Nazis', 'take', 'Guido', 'tolerant', 'uncle', 'Giustino', 'Durano', 'little', 'Giosue', 'unidentified', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Dora', 'train', 'station', 'demands', 'be', 'put', 'also', 'train', 'death', 'camp', 'order', 'protect', 'son', 'nightmare', 'place', 'Guido', 'imagination', 'creating', 'illusion', 'everything', 'happening', 'just', 'game', 'epic', 'game', 'will', 'be', 'exciting', 'fun', 'Giosue', 'hiding', 'Gestapo', 'soldiers', 'whom', 'simply', 'men', 'who', 'yell', 'lot', 'maintaining', 'silence', 'can', 'gain', 'necessary', 'points', 'win', 'tank', 'Not', 'toy', 'tank', 'full-size', 'tank', ""'ll"", 'be', 'free', 'take', 'home', 'co-writer', 'Benigni', 'Vincenzo', 'Cerami', ""n't"", 'just', 'mix', 'drama', 'comedy', 'often', 'drama', 'comedy', 'film', 'not', 'dwell', 'horrors', 'camp', 'ignore', 'memorable', 'score', 'Nicola', 'Piovani', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'important', 'film', 'triumphant', 'timeless', 'sublime', 'entertain', 'educate', 'move', 'potent', 'combination', 'humor', 'poignancy', 'dignity', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'taken', 'pure', 'horror', 'turned', 'love', 'story', 'man', 'woman', 'father', 'son', 'actor', 'Benigni', 'wise', 'simple', 'performance', 'make', 'tragic', 'situations', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'natural', 'distant', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'far', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'only', 'nice', 'beautiful', 'cinema', 'film', 'won', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Best', 'Dramatic', 'Score']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

Sardrena,"[1, 8]","Since the Italian film Life Is Beautiful deals with the Second World War and the Holocaust, many viewers watched for signs of insensitivity; really they were looking for any traces of irreverence towards subject matter which forces the filmmakers to tread carefully.  The very notion that this film could be a comedy offended some viewers.  My unease was of a different sort; the way that Italians portray their nation's involvement in the war.It has become a widely accepted notion that Italians were victims of the NAZI's - presumably due to the Wehrmacht's slow fighting retreat up the peninsula during the last years of the war.  But is that a truthful notion?  After all. the Italians invented Fascism.  Mussolini came to power eleven years before Hitler, and was a role model for the latter.  NAZI Germany came to Italy's aid when they ineptly invaded Greece and Egypt.  When the Allies landed in Italy, the Italians switched sides and greeted them as liberators.  Given this appalling wartime record, can the Italians claim equal status with the French, Greeks, et cetera as innocent victims?  They can and do claim that mantle, but should not.  Vestiges of Fascism remain in Italy to this day.I know the rejoinder: ""Come on, it's a comedy.""  But it is a pretentious comedy treading on important history.  Millions of people define themselves today in relation to that conflict, therefore the truth must be served.

This is 100% true.  However, how many Schindler's Lists do we really need to see?  This movie was not intended to chronicle every injustice suffered by the Jewish people.  It is more a story of family.  As a Holocaust movie, it is mixed, but as a love story and a story of family persevering through trying times, it succeeds fully.  Benigni is hilarious and charming in the first half as he woos his future wife while happily bumbling through life.  And in the second half, he is a tragic optimist, as he shields his son from the horrors of their situation.  Although featured very little in the film, the son is really the focal point, and the whole movie is basically told through the rosy memories of the child and the stories he has heard about his father.While some may find the white-washing of Nazi atrocities offensive, again it should be understood that this is not a movie about the Holocaust.

This was one of the first movies I played on my Dolby Digital sound system and was quite impressed with the technical  quality of this DVD which unfortunately is not always the case with  'foreign' language productions. The English dubbing is best avoided and  should only be used if you tire of reading the subtitles.As to the  movie itself, cannot say much that has not already been said - after all  232 reviews at the time of writing! All I will add is Benigni is a genius  for coming up with a very visually pleasant concoction (the lights, shadows  and colors in the movie are excellent) of everything that is politically  correct, fashionable, maudlin, and marketable - and making it palatable to  a xenophobic Hollywood generation. Arezzo and Tuscany, a little boy to melt  your heart, romance and rain and steam rising from cobblestone streets, Jim  Carrey-isque like capers and WW II atrocities are just some of the  ingredients in the mixture. Nothing ever really jells or flows. A little  emotional tickle results with the little boy tugging at your heartstrings.  The scenes in the internment camp are sometimes so ludicrous, improbable  and so wild, you have the gas chamber sequences to remind you `Hey! We are  dealing with a serious situation here!'The backdrop of the Holocaust is  an intriguing choice.  I personally prefer serious treatment of such  sensitive topics - where comedy finds expression, if any, in the fortitude  and wisdom of the characters experiencing the pain. A powerful script and a  strong acting performance should convey these transient and conflicting  emotions - w/o using painful visual inserts (almost as afterthoughts) from  the Holocaust. The script is undecided between comedy and severity and  Benigni as an actor fails to convey the duality of the fabricated  existence.  Benigni instead holds the audience hostage - with a poor  attempt at comedy spread on a canvas of the Holocaust and making us feel a  mixed bag of emotions. Him being shot is a poor attempt at salvaging what  is obviously a very predictable ending.  I expected him to pop up from  behind the bushes with that silly grin on his face.In conclusion, it  was an intriguing and novel attempt at recording a time and place in  history - and that is where lies the value of this movie.",3,My Two Cents In the Mix,948758400,"01 25, 2000",2000,2406,"['Let', 'talk', 'quality', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'aspects', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'played', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'sound', 'system', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'technical', 'quality', 'DVD', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'always', 'case', ""'foreign"", 'language', 'productions', 'English', 'dubbing', 'best', 'avoided', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'used', 'tire', 'reading', 'subtitles.As', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'not', 'already', 'been', 'said', '232', 'reviews', 'time', 'writing', 'will', 'add', 'Benigni', 'genius', 'coming', 'up', 'very', 'visually', 'pleasant', 'concoction', 'lights', 'shadows', 'colors', 'movie', 'are', 'excellent', 'everything', 'politically', 'correct', 'fashionable', 'maudlin', 'marketable', 'making', 'palatable', 'xenophobic', 'Hollywood', 'generation', 'Arezzo', 'Tuscany', 'little', 'boy', 'melt', 'heart', 'romance', 'rain', 'steam', 'rising', 'cobblestone', 'streets', 'Jim', 'Carrey-isque', 'capers', 'WW', 'II', 'atrocities', 'are', 'just', 'ingredients', 'mixture', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'little', 'emotional', 'tickle', 'results', 'little', 'boy', 'tugging', 'heartstrings', 'scenes', 'internment', 'camp', 'are', 'sometimes', 'so', 'ludicrous', 'improbable', 'so', 'wild', 'have', 'gas', 'chamber', 'sequences', 'remind', 'Hey', 'are', 'dealing', 'serious', 'situation', 'here', ""'The"", 'backdrop', 'Holocaust', 'intriguing', 'choice', 'personally', 'prefer', 'serious', 'treatment', 'such', 'sensitive', 'topics', 'where', 'comedy', 'expression', 'fortitude', 'wisdom', 'characters', 'experiencing', 'pain', 'powerful', 'script', 'strong', 'acting', 'performance', 'should', 'convey', 'transient', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'w/o', 'using', 'painful', 'visual', 'inserts', 'almost', 'afterthoughts', 'Holocaust', 'script', 'undecided', 'comedy', 'severity', 'Benigni', 'actor', 'convey', 'duality', 'fabricated', 'existence', 'Benigni', 'instead', 'audience', 'hostage', 'poor', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'spread', 'canvas', 'Holocaust', 'making', 'feel', 'mixed', 'bag', 'emotions', 'Him', 'being', 'shot', 'poor', 'attempt', 'salvaging', 'what', 'obviously', 'very', 'predictable', 'ending', 'expected', 'pop', 'up', 'bushes', 'silly', 'grin', 'face.In', 'conclusion', 'was', 'intriguing', 'novel', 'attempt', 'recording', 'time', 'place', 'history', 'where', 'value', 'movie']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

BEAN GOES TO AUSCHWITZ.  Actual history proved just too distracting for me to get caught up in this ""fable.""Actually, the film I kept thinking of has never been seen: Jerry Lewis' THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED.  I've read the script and I can only imagine the reviews of that film if it was ever released!  (Now there's a film in itself: a daffy but deranged filmmaker, popping pills and performing pratfalls, producing his movie about a German clown entertaining Jewish kids on their way to the ovens.  Yikes.)LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL doesn't go that far, but I found myself constantly distracted by Benigni's rubbery slapstick taking place in a concentration camp.  Yeah, it's sweet that he wants to spare his son the horrors of the camp...but they're in a camp, a concentration camp.The first half of the film actually plays like a whimsical, slightly-more-witty Jerry Lewis movie.  Then the Nazis arrive.  Individual scenes manage to touch and charm, but overall it just feels very odd.Jerry Lewis must have gone nuts when Benigni won the Best Actor Academy Award (William Goldman, the sage of screenwriters, certainly did in print by saying this was the greatest Oscar abomination since THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH won Best Picture in the 1950s).  I admit I was put off at Benigni's antics at the Oscars--""I LUFF YOU, I LUFF YOU ALL, I MAKE LUFF TO YOU ALL!""  I can't even picture Jerry Lewis carrying on that much if he'd won Best Actor for THE BELLBOY.  Now that I think about it, maybe he would....Yes, movies are a great escape from reality--but there are some realities that shouldn't be part of that escape.We have new generations of kids coming up who are quite removed from the terrifying reality of the Holocaust and the near-slapstick version of it portrayed in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL could diminish the true horror of it.That heaviness, that memory, made buying into the humor nearly impossible.",2,"Life is Beautiful, Movies can be Weird",1070150400,"11 30, 2003",2003,2081,"['skimming', 'reviews', 'here', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'obviously', 'struck', 'chord', 'lot', 'people.I', 'would', 'not', 'argue', 'found', 'reviewer', 'who', 'called', 'film', 'MR.', 'BEAN', 'GOES', 'TO', 'AUSCHWITZ', 'Actual', 'history', 'proved', 'just', 'too', 'distracting', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'fable', 'Actually', 'film', 'kept', 'thinking', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'THE', 'DAY', 'THE', 'CLOWN', 'CRIED', ""'ve"", 'read', 'script', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'reviews', 'film', 'was', 'ever', 'released', 'Now', 'film', 'daffy', 'deranged', 'filmmaker', 'popping', 'pills', 'performing', 'pratfalls', 'producing', 'movie', 'German', 'clown', 'entertaining', 'Jewish', 'kids', 'way', 'ovens', 'Yikes', 'LIFE', 'IS', 'BEAUTIFUL', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'found', 'constantly', 'distracted', 'Benigni', 'rubbery', 'slapstick', 'taking', 'place', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Yeah', 'sweet', 'spare', 'son', 'horrors', 'camp', ""'re"", 'camp', 'concentration', 'camp.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'actually', 'whimsical', 'slightly-more-witty', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'movie', 'Then', 'Nazis', 'arrive', 'Individual', 'manage', 'touch', 'charm', 'overall', 'just', 'feels', 'very', 'odd.Jerry', 'Lewis', 'must', 'have', 'gone', 'nuts', 'when', 'Benigni', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'William', 'Goldman', 'sage', 'screenwriters', 'certainly', 'did', 'print', 'saying', 'was', 'greatest', 'Oscar', 'abomination', 'GREATEST', 'SHOW', 'ON', 'EARTH', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', '1950s', 'admit', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'Benigni', 'antics', 'Oscars', 'LUFF', 'YOU', 'LUFF', 'ALL', 'MAKE', 'LUFF', 'TO', 'YOU', 'ALL', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'picture', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'carrying', 'much', ""'d"", 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'THE', 'BELLBOY', 'Now', 'think', 'maybe', 'would', '.Yes', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'escape', 'reality', 'are', 'realities', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'part', 'escape.We', 'have', 'new', 'generations', 'kids', 'coming', 'up', 'who', 'are', 'quite', 'removed', 'terrifying', 'reality', 'Holocaust', 'near-slapstick', 'version', 'portrayed', 'LIFE', 'IS', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'could', 'diminish', 'true', 'horror', 'it.That', 'heaviness', 'memory', 'made', 'buying', 'humor', 'nearly', 'impossible']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS
463729,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,6305426651,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[4, 4]","""Life Is Beautiful"" is a film that is daring in its attempt to create laughs in the realistic setting of the Holocaust, yet filled with considerable visual comedy  The movie opens in Italy in 1939. Guido (Roberto Benigni) is a carefree drifter with a modest dream of going to the city to open a bookstore.  Guido falls in love with Dora (Ncoletta Braschi, Benigni's wife), who is engaged to a humorless Fascist thug.  Guido wins her heart by sheer persistence and his tireless sense of humor.Guido and Dora marry and have a son, Giosue, but by now Italy has been overtaken by the Nazis, who soon begin rounding up all Italian Jews, including father and son.  Dora insists on going with her family on the train to the work camp.To protect his son from the real horrors of the camp, Guido tries to transform their plight by turning unpleasantries into games, always trying to shield the boy from what really takes place.Benigni won an Academy Award for this film, which stirred controversy because of the conceit of turning the Holocaust -- even in fictional terms -- into a lighthearted comedy, which had never been done before.  The fact that we get to know Guido as a happy-go-lucky clown allows the second half of the movie to work.  Like Chaplin, Benigni has the ability to create big laughs through slapstick and sight gags in one scene, while eliciting pathos in another.  The balance works, as the viewer gets an escalating sense of the inevitable as Guido's games are harder to pass off as frivolity.  In addition to starring, Benigni co-wrote the screenplay and directed.Blu-ray bonus extra include a making-of featurette, Academy Awards TV commercials, and theatrical trailer.",4,A Unique Film With a Chaplinesque Performance,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,1685,"['Life', 'Beautiful', 'film', 'daring', 'attempt', 'create', 'laughs', 'realistic', 'setting', 'Holocaust', 'yet', 'filled', 'considerable', 'visual', 'comedy', 'movie', 'Italy', '1939', 'Guido', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'carefree', 'drifter', 'modest', 'dream', 'going', 'city', 'open', 'bookstore', 'Guido', 'love', 'Dora', 'Ncoletta', 'Braschi', 'Benigni', 'wife', 'who', 'engaged', 'humorless', 'Fascist', 'thug', 'Guido', 'heart', 'sheer', 'persistence', 'tireless', 'sense', 'humor.Guido', 'Dora', 'marry', 'have', 'son', 'Giosue', 'now', 'Italy', 'been', 'overtaken', 'Nazis', 'who', 'soon', 'begin', 'rounding', 'up', 'Italian', 'Jews', 'including', 'father', 'son', 'Dora', 'going', 'family', 'train', 'work', 'camp.To', 'protect', 'son', 'real', 'horrors', 'camp', 'Guido', 'transform', 'plight', 'turning', 'unpleasantries', 'games', 'always', 'trying', 'shield', 'boy', 'what', 'really', 'place.Benigni', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'film', 'stirred', 'controversy', 'conceit', 'turning', 'Holocaust', 'even', 'fictional', 'terms', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'fact', 'get', 'know', 'Guido', 'happy-go-lucky', 'clown', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'work', 'Chaplin', 'Benigni', 'ability', 'create', 'big', 'laughs', 'slapstick', 'sight', 'gags', 'one', 'scene', 'eliciting', 'pathos', 'balance', 'viewer', 'escalating', 'sense', 'inevitable', 'Guido', 'games', 'are', 'harder', 'pass', 'off', 'frivolity', 'addition', 'starring', 'Benigni', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'directed.Blu-ray', 'bonus', 'extra', 'include', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'TV', 'commercials', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS

To me, Holocaust is one of these subjects. Slapstick and clowning around do not belong here. I am sorry to be so categorical, because I like Benigni's work very much, and generally, his movies are both art and entertainment of the highest class. I think I know what he was trying to do here, and he achieved it. But emotionally I cannot accept this product. This movie has a very different feel than the much lighter ""Johnny Stecchino"" and ""The Monster"" (two of his other big hits in America). That is to say, the movie does not leave you feeling that you have just seen a wild, light comedy, but instead, leaves you feeling that you have had a trying experience and know what it's like to confront real evil. This was almost certainly intentional and the only appropriate way to go, but then we are back to the argument that the comedic elements just do not ""belong."" .... But here you have a death camp and genocidal Germans--a ""truly different race"" as one character calls them in admiration. By the way, it is typical of Benigni's approach to drop this kind of ""hints"" to make his statements--he almost never generalizes in a direct fashion. The mere presence of his puzzle-obssessed German doctor, who is entirely incapable of empathy, says more about the single-minded, cold-blooded determination of the Nazis than entire volumes of verbal propaganda ever could.The acting in ""Life is Beautiful"" is of the highest quality. Benigni again engages his real-life wife Nicoletta Braschi as his co-star and on screen love interest who eventually marries him. Braschi's character, Dora, who is not Jewish, nevertheless follows her husband and son to the camp, when the invading Germans spread their genocidal policy to Italy. This is where the second part of the movie takes place. If you know a lot about WW II and the Holocaust, then the movie is hard to watch and it's hard to accept that its humor fits. But if you are new to the subject or feel rather emotionally distant from it, perhaps you can enjoy the movie as a moving inspirational story.

Chan ""vandelist""","[4, 6]","I've been reading a few of these reviews, and quite frankly, I've been disappointed with those who despise this wonderful and wholesome film.  I think the fact that this film is considered somewhat of a controversy is a misconception -- this is one of the most beautiful and fulfilling films I have ever experienced.I guess some people label this as comedy, but I don't see it as so.  Yes, there are moments where you laugh, but this is hardly a piece that can be taken lightly.  Perhaps Benigni shouldn't have used the Holocaust as a background for his story as that has seemed to offend many viewers, people who believe that it does not do the horrible historical event justice.  Being that I am not (Jewish) I cannot know the extent of this offense...However, I don't believe Benigni's intention was to dishonor the event in any way.  Furthermore, this movie is fiction, and is NOT, and has never claimed to be, a movie based on the events of the Holocaust.This film is not about the Holocaust.  It is about a beautiful and loving family in adverse times, and the sacrifices parents are willing to make to maintain the innocent mind of their beloved child.  This film is an expression of humanity, and survival.Some people I've spoken with expressed their disgust for the film's title, since the ending's tragedy does not seem to fit the meaning of the title.  I disagree.  The laughter and tears are an equal summation of the title - the beauty of the tragedy is the love that lives on, and that is passed down from one generation to the next.
