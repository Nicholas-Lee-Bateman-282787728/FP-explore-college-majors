551495,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,B00004U28P,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[0, 0]","Jason and the Argonauts had everything going for it- great special effects, terrific production team (Many Of Whom Had Worked On The Odyssey), an experienced director, a solid supporting cast, a beautiful damsel and a locations that were breathtaking. Unfortunately what it did not have- where it fell flat- was that it did not have a true lead actor. Had Jason London been able to carry the weight of the character, this would have been a Four or Five Star movie. Unfortunately due to this major flaw, I cannot give the production more than Three Stars. To do so would be to insult The Odyssey, which had Armand Assante, an actor with the experience and precision to carry the weight of a big budget production on his back (See My Four Star Review For That Great Mini-Series).This review is for the show I taped from television in 2000. I do not claim to know what the DVD contains. Are there deleted scenes and/or extras that might add a Half Star to my rating? I do not know. When I get around to seeing the DVD I shall comment on its pros and cons.As far as Jason's crew: They were an elite bunch! Although not soldiers themselves, they came together and jelled at the right time. I liked that they were cosmopolitan group. Orpheus was supposed to represent a black African who had contact with the Greeks perhaps from Axum and/or Meroe (Although According To Ancient Greek Sources He Was Of Thracian Descent). The others were from Turkey and Italy and Greece & Greek Islands. They were sheperds and stonemasons, farmers and archers. I liked this crew more than I did the so-called ""professional"" crew of Odysseus. Odysseus's men seemed to be a more selfish and ignorant lot than Jason's crew, whoose loyalty and devoition to him only grew and grew. I liked Argos and Hercules the most--followed by Orpheus, played wonderfully by Adrian Lester.The CGI effects were quite impressive to me. For television they were quite spectacular. As I've said before, if only they had gotten a better lead. Brendan Fraser would have been perfect for the role; at that time he would have been the right age.I give this a marginal recommendation if only because I so love Greek Mythology. I next plan to buy Clash of the Titans-- the original and the remake.A.

551496,AB34G6VKP28L,B00004U28P,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[1, 1]","A legendary tale of great heroics, Jason and the Argonauts is the story of one man's journey to find the legendary golden fleece that will grant its owner anything his heart desires. It is an adventure, a romance, and authentic mythology from beginning to end.After the kingdom is stormed and its ruler (Ciarn Hinds) slaughtered by his evil brother Pelias (Dennis Hopper), the heir to the throne, young Jason, is taken by a temple guard far from the city. Raised among the impoverished of his nation, with his true heritage kept a secret from those who would wish to destroy him, Jason (Jason London) soon wishes to discern the truth. He returns to the homeland of his fathers and on the way gives aid to a crippled old woman, who promises him that a great journey lies before him.Little does Jason know that the old woman is the goddess Hera (Olivia Williams), who toys in the fates of men for pleasure. Jason's mother has long invoked Hera's name as a guardian over her son's fate and because of her loathing for Pelias, Hera has chosen Jason to succeed him to the throne. Her emotionally distant and mischievous husband Zeus becomes jealous of Hera's love for Jason and determines to make his trials difficult. Jason is captured and taken as a prisoner to the palace, where Pelias offers him his life in exchange for the theft of the golden fleece, a mystical object he has long sought. If Jason does not return in six months' time, his mother's life will be forfeit. Determined to persevere, he gathers together an intrepid group of sailors willing to take on a great adventure, among their ranks the legendary Hercules (Brian Thompson). Together they encounter many trials and dangers, from enraging the sea god to fighting demons, following a mythical star chart, and finally the epic battle with the fleece's keeper, a dragon.The fleece is in the guardianship of King Aertes (Frank Langella), whose daughter is a sorceress chosen to protect its powers. Medea (Jolene Blalock) foresees the approach of Jason and predicts it will bring their downfall. Rather than setting out to sabotage him, with a little help from Hera and the god of love, Medea will compel him to succeed. The result is a tale that is well transcribed to the screen and beautifully filmed. A story that has enraptured audiences for thousands of years is treated with decency, given strong dialogue and intriguing characters. While the gods wage war in the heavens, Jason forges forth with a gathering that become likable as time wears on. The thief who wishes to be reformed, but not quite enough to keep his hands off other people's property. The young woman who has always loved Jason but cannot seem to draw more than brotherly affection from him. Hercules, who never fails to amuse the audience by spouting off one of his legendary victories. ""And, as always,"" he says with a less than modest shrug, ""I saved the day!""From evil princes to mythological creatures such as sprites, demons, dragons, and sirens, to an old blind prophet banished to endless hunger for displeasing the gods (a cameo by Derek Jacobi), the story is highly engaging and enjoyable. There are some production flaws. It's evident the filmmakers have never observed a bull ride. Their supposedly monstrous and terrifying supernatural bull appears to be hopping around the arena. Its animation is also shoddy, odd when you consider that they do a fantastic job with all the other elements, including the dragon and demons. There is some wooden acting involved, particularly on Jason's part.Because of the violence, conflicting religious aspect, and implied sensuality, children should not be allowed to view this film, but for older audiences it's an amusing and creative interpretation of the classic myth.",3,A Creative Interpreation of a Classic Myth,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3756,"['legendary', 'tale', 'great', 'heroics', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'journey', 'find', 'legendary', 'golden', 'fleece', 'will', 'grant', 'owner', 'anything', 'heart', 'adventure', 'romance', 'authentic', 'mythology', 'beginning', 'end.After', 'kingdom', 'stormed', 'ruler', 'Ciarn', 'Hinds', 'slaughtered', 'evil', 'brother', 'Pelias', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'heir', 'throne', 'young', 'Jason', 'taken', 'temple', 'guard', 'far', 'city', 'Raised', 'impoverished', 'nation', 'true', 'heritage', 'kept', 'secret', 'who', 'would', 'wish', 'destroy', 'Jason', 'Jason', 'London', 'soon', 'wishes', 'discern', 'truth', 'homeland', 'fathers', 'way', 'aid', 'crippled', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'great', 'journey', 'him.Little', 'Jason', 'know', 'old', 'woman', 'goddess', 'Hera', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'who', 'fates', 'men', 'pleasure', 'Jason', 'mother', 'long', 'invoked', 'Hera', 'name', 'guardian', 'son', 'fate', 'loathing', 'Pelias', 'Hera', 'chosen', 'Jason', 'succeed', 'throne', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'mischievous', 'husband', 'Zeus', 'jealous', 'Hera', 'love', 'Jason', 'determines', 'make', 'trials', 'difficult', 'Jason', 'captured', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'palace', 'where', 'Pelias', 'life', 'exchange', 'theft', 'golden', 'fleece', 'mystical', 'object', 'long', 'sought', 'Jason', 'not', 'return', 'six', 'months', 'time', 'mother', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'forfeit', 'Determined', 'persevere', 'together', 'intrepid', 'group', 'sailors', 'willing', 'take', 'great', 'adventure', 'ranks', 'legendary', 'Hercules', 'Brian', 'Thompson', 'Together', 'encounter', 'many', 'trials', 'dangers', 'enraging', 'sea', 'god', 'fighting', 'demons', 'following', 'mythical', 'star', 'chart', 'finally', 'epic', 'battle', 'fleece', 'keeper', 'dragon.The', 'fleece', 'guardianship', 'King', 'Aertes', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'daughter', 'sorceress', 'chosen', 'protect', 'powers', 'Medea', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'approach', 'Jason', 'will', 'bring', 'downfall', 'Rather', 'setting', 'out', 'sabotage', 'little', 'help', 'Hera', 'god', 'love', 'Medea', 'will', 'compel', 'succeed', 'result', 'tale', 'well', 'transcribed', 'screen', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'story', 'enraptured', 'audiences', 'thousands', 'years', 'treated', 'decency', 'given', 'strong', 'dialogue', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'gods', 'wage', 'war', 'heavens', 'Jason', 'forth', 'gathering', 'become', 'likable', 'time', 'wears', 'thief', 'who', 'be', 'reformed', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'keep', 'hands', 'other', 'people', 'property', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'always', 'loved', 'Jason', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'draw', 'more', 'brotherly', 'affection', 'Hercules', 'who', 'never', 'amuse', 'audience', 'spouting', 'off', 'one', 'legendary', 'victories', 'always', 'less', 'modest', 'shrug', 'saved', 'day', 'evil', 'princes', 'mythological', 'creatures', 'such', 'sprites', 'demons', 'dragons', 'sirens', 'old', 'blind', 'prophet', 'banished', 'endless', 'hunger', 'displeasing', 'gods', 'cameo', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'story', 'highly', 'engaging', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'production', 'flaws', 'evident', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'never', 'observed', 'bull', 'ride', 'supposedly', 'monstrous', 'terrifying', 'supernatural', 'bull', 'be', 'hopping', 'arena', 'animation', 'also', 'shoddy', 'odd', 'when', 'consider', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'other', 'elements', 'including', 'dragon', 'demons', 'wooden', 'acting', 'involved', 'particularly', 'Jason', 'part.Because', 'violence', 'conflicting', 'religious', 'aspect', 'implied', 'sensuality', 'children', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'view', 'film', 'older', 'audiences', 'amusing', 'creative', 'interpretation', 'classic', 'myth']",Jason and the Argonauts
551497,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00004U28P,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[14, 18]","When I saw this latest version of the story of Jason and his search for the fabled Golden Fleece was scheduled for broadcast on the Hallmark channel I was intrigued. Not only did the movie feature not one, but two of the most beautiful women in Hollywood today - Natasha (`Species') Henstridge and Jolene (`Enterprise') Blalock, but it also promised four hours of grand entertainment.Why then was I, about an hour into it, looking wistfully over at my DVD collection and in particular the classic Harryhausen version of the tale and contemplating what could have been.Essentially put, this new adaptation of the Greek legend is a dud. Not only is the lead actor wholly unconvincing throughout but the action is tired, the narrative too drawn out and the pace sluggish. It does not help either that Henstridge's part (although top billed) is essentially nothing more than an extended cameo and that Blalock is unrecognizable (after watching her in a scene it was only her voice that clued me in to it being her).Also why is it that the set design and effects looked cheaper and less convincing than they did four decades earlier?All in all this was a huge disappointment and something Hallmark should have done better. For an example of the channel getting these made-for-television features/mini-series right check out the simply superb and very entertaining `La Femme Musketeer.'",3,Sluggish version of the Jason legend,1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,1380,"['When', 'saw', 'latest', 'version', 'story', 'Jason', 'search', 'fabled', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'was', 'scheduled', 'broadcast', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'was', 'intrigued', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'movie', 'feature', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'Natasha', 'Species', 'Henstridge', 'Jolene', 'Enterprise', 'Blalock', 'also', 'promised', 'four', 'hours', 'grand', 'entertainment.Why', 'then', 'was', 'hour', 'looking', 'wistfully', 'DVD', 'collection', 'particular', 'classic', 'Harryhausen', 'version', 'tale', 'contemplating', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been.Essentially', 'put', 'new', 'adaptation', 'Greek', 'legend', 'dud', 'Not', 'only', 'lead', 'actor', 'wholly', 'unconvincing', 'action', 'tired', 'narrative', 'too', 'drawn', 'out', 'pace', 'sluggish', 'not', 'help', 'Henstridge', 'part', 'top', 'billed', 'essentially', 'nothing', 'more', 'extended', 'cameo', 'Blalock', 'unrecognizable', 'watching', 'scene', 'was', 'only', 'voice', 'clued', 'being', '.Also', 'why', 'set', 'design', 'effects', 'looked', 'cheaper', 'less', 'convincing', 'did', 'four', 'decades', 'earlier', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'something', 'Hallmark', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'example', 'channel', 'getting', 'made-for-television', 'features/mini-series', 'right', 'check', 'out', 'simply', 'superb', 'very', 'entertaining', 'La', 'Femme', 'Musketeer']",Jason and the Argonauts
551498,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B00004U28P,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[9, 11]","No matter what anyone says, this film is by far &amp; away superior to the 1962 Todd Armstrong movie.  I own both on DVD and watched them on consecutive nights for comparison.  There was no comparison.  The 1962 film is full of very stilted acting and the story is incomplete [plus, the ending is rather &quot;sudden&quot;].  The acting in the present version is better (although not always perfect - more on that later), the script is smoother, and the storyline is more inclusive of the Greek myth.One of the best features of the present film is its presentation of the Gods.  They are seen as being both awe-inspiringly powerful, yet at the same time full of petty emotions and childish jealousies.  These anthropomorphic tendencies infused into almost all-powerful entities is precisely how they are depicted in Homer's ILIAD.  JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS picks up on this aspect more than any other film on Greek mythology that I have seen.For the most part, the casting of this movie is superb.  Although it becomes readily apparent that Jason London was picked due to his good looks rather than his acting talents, he is nonetheless adequate.  Jolene Blalock is terrific as the sultry, mysterious and exotic Medea.  Dennis Hopper plays a wonderful ruthless &amp; whacked-out Pelias  (of course, whenver you give Hopper a character who is whacked out, you can be sure that he will deliver).  Likewise, Frank Langella is perfect as the manipulative king of Caucaus, and seeing the legendary Derek Jacobi as Phineas is a treat.  Brian Thompson plays a good Hercules, and has a far superior physique to Nigel Green, who played the strongman in the 1962 version.A nice plus for this film is that it adds a few other characters from Greek mythology to the crew of the Argo, such as Atalanta and Orpheus.  What is even better is that they actually made them both into major contributing as opposed to being merely ornaments.Although there are a few holes in the plot @ the end of the movie, where they never really engage Pelias' army (or perhaps they simply forget about it......hmmmmm....maybe Aristotle would call it DEUS EX MACHINA?), this is a very good effort and well worth watching.

I was really hoping that this newer version would put that one to shame.  Unfortunately, i was disappointed.  Not that this new version was horribly bad.  It was just so-so.  It has a few good special affects.  But nothing spectactular that really jumped out at me.  The movie is not real fast moving, and it's a little long.

Of course, I knew before I watched it that there was no way that it could match the fun and excitement of the original. But I didn't think THIS MUCH!The acting isn't very good. Jason London does pretty good at times, but also ranges from emotionless wood, to spoiled brat, to antiviolent coward. Dennis Hopper, who usually makes a great bad guy, sucks in this case. And everyone else just stands around, saying their lines, looking bored (but not as bored as the audience).The special effects are very obvious. The harpies look like a bunch of chicken-lizard monkeys, and are more laughable than menacing. (There's just something about the old Ray Harryhausen stop-motion technique that is simply pure magic, and can never be surpassed by any computer.)Another thing: while the mood of the first two thirds is just action-adventure, the last third relies on dull, stupid romance (the very ending where everyone just starts kissing in ways that they would never think of in ancient Greece, makes you scream in annoyance!). Let's just say that you can really tell that this is Hallmark.On the other hand, it does sprout some verrrry nice-looking chicks here and there, as well as beautiful scenery. The score is pretty good, I guess, but rather than have lots of minor themes, it just replays the main theme over and over and over again!

Brian Thompson (the alien bounty hunter from THE X-FILES TV show) is a hearty and jovial Hercules, while the kings of Frank Langella and Dennis Hopper and Natasha Henstridge's queen provide ample opposition for our hero.  As the musician Orpheus, Adrian Lester delivers a thoughtful and solid performance.  Robert McFadden is good as a petulant, yet puckish, Zeus.  Unfortunately, where this movie falters is in the performance of Jason London as our hero.  While he has the &quot;angry young man&quot; aspect right, he lacks the heroic passion and fire (that Todd Armstrong displayed in the 60's version) needed to be a credible leader of his Argonaut crew.

If you really want to see the worst movie of the 20th century...check out Kull. Not even watchable. But when Jason and the Argonauts came on, I was immediately taken by the depth of the acting. I think the choice of Jason London was done on purpose...he obviously is portraying an ""innocent"", not established in any way as a man, and at the whim of the gods.And I happen to believe that Baron Munchausen is one of the most glorious scifi/fantasy movies ever made (along with Dune), so I consider any comparisons a compliment to the new Argonauts.(Side note...this is apparently a fullscreen DVD.

Originally, my expectations were low, but I ended up pleasantly surprised.As this will inevitably draw comparisons to Harryhausen's version, let me start out by saying the FX in this, though computer graphics, was top-notch for the time, as good as the graphics in some major motion pictures.  These are definitely 2 levels above the rather featureless, robotic computer models as seen in the ""Hercules"" and ""Xena"" shows.  The Harpies in particular were well done, and overall the animation superior to that seen in the rather lackluster TV remake of ""Mysterious Island"" with Patrick Stewart.Because of the longer running time than the original, this version has more story derived from the myth.  This gives the excellent cast room to shine and I feel the characterizations are what makes this movie.  Dennis Hopper was surprisingly good as Jason's evil uncle, Orpheus has his moment at the clashing rocks with his pet seagull, Hera is particularly beautiful and godlike, Hercules is well cast, Langella is regal and tragic as King of Colchis......its a pleasure to see a production like this give equal attention to story as to spectacle.The musical score is passionate and humanistic but lacks the heroic majesty of Bernard Hermann's soundtrack from the 1963 version.  Some reviewers felt that the actor in the lead was flat as Jason.  Perhaps, but if you look at what this character is actually doing, you may find that the only way to bring Jason to life is to paint him as a scoundrel.  I mean, here's a guy who sailed to the end of the known world to steal a precious artifact from a people who welcomed him.  Anyone who knows the actual myth knows that it was actually Medea who repeatedly made Jason's successes possible.  It was Medea who hypnotized the serpent guarding the golden fleece so Jason could steal it, Medea who killed her own younger brother so Jason could escape while her father stopped to pick up the pieces of the body, Medea who tricked Jason's uncle's daughters into murdering their father.  And how does Jason repay all of this?  He dumps Medea for a younger woman. Jason ends his days badly as a result of this, but this is an ending Hollywood never wants to show.  It would be interesting to see a truly faithful version but face it, this guy isn't exactly a role-model, and even in the movie versions some of this comes through.At any rate, this is a well-cast, spectacular remake that can be very entertaining as long as the viewer keeps an open mind and doesn't get hung up over it as being some kind of ""threat"" to the original.",5,Worthy of Harryhausen,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,2815,"['1963', 'film', 'version', 'greek', 'myth', 'was', 'more', 'tightly', 'scripted', 'stronger', 'lead', 'bear', 'mind', 'one', 'question', 'was', '2-part', 'TV', 'movie', 'mini-series', 'necessarily', 'longer', 'filled', 'running', 'time', 'solid', 'story', 'Originally', 'expectations', 'were', 'low', 'ended', 'up', 'pleasantly', 'will', 'inevitably', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'Harryhausen', 'version', 'let', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'FX', 'computer', 'graphics', 'was', 'top-notch', 'time', 'as', 'good', 'graphics', 'major', 'motion', 'pictures', 'are', 'definitely', '2', 'levels', 'rather', 'featureless', 'robotic', 'computer', 'models', 'seen', 'Hercules', 'Xena', 'shows', 'Harpies', 'particular', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'animation', 'superior', 'seen', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'TV', 'remake', 'Mysterious', 'Island', 'Patrick', 'Stewart.Because', 'longer', 'running', 'time', 'original', 'version', 'more', 'story', 'derived', 'myth', 'excellent', 'cast', 'room', 'shine', 'feel', 'characterizations', 'are', 'what', 'movie', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Jason', 'evil', 'uncle', 'Orpheus', 'moment', 'clashing', 'rocks', 'pet', 'seagull', 'Hera', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'godlike', 'Hercules', 'well', 'cast', 'Langella', 'regal', 'tragic', 'King', 'Colchis', 'pleasure', 'see', 'production', 'give', 'equal', 'attention', 'story', 'spectacle.The', 'musical', 'score', 'passionate', 'humanistic', 'heroic', 'majesty', 'Bernard', 'Hermann', 'soundtrack', '1963', 'version', 'reviewers', 'felt', 'actor', 'lead', 'was', 'flat', 'Jason', 'Perhaps', 'look', 'what', 'character', 'actually', 'doing', 'may', 'find', 'only', 'way', 'bring', 'Jason', 'life', 'paint', 'scoundrel', 'mean', 'here', 'guy', 'who', 'sailed', 'end', 'known', 'world', 'steal', 'precious', 'artifact', 'people', 'who', 'welcomed', 'Anyone', 'who', 'actual', 'myth', 'was', 'actually', 'Medea', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'made', 'Jason', 'successes', 'possible', 'was', 'Medea', 'who', 'hypnotized', 'serpent', 'guarding', 'golden', 'fleece', 'Jason', 'could', 'steal', 'Medea', 'who', 'killed', 'own', 'younger', 'brother', 'Jason', 'could', 'escape', 'father', 'stopped', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'body', 'Medea', 'who', 'tricked', 'Jason', 'uncle', 'daughters', 'murdering', 'father', 'how', 'Jason', 'repay', 'Medea', 'younger', 'woman', 'Jason', 'days', 'badly', 'result', 'ending', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'truly', 'faithful', 'version', 'face', 'guy', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'role-model', 'even', 'movie', 'through.At', 'rate', 'well-cast', 'spectacular', 'remake', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'as', 'long', 'viewer', 'open', 'mind', ""n't"", 'get', 'hung', 'up', 'over', 'being', 'kind', 'threat', 'original']",Jason and the Argonauts

We also have Jason (Jason London) and the Argo visiting the land of the Amazons and other details from the epic poem written by the third-century poet Apollonius of Rhodes, as well as the relationship between Jason and Pelias (Dennis Hopper) taken from Pindar.  There is also a hint of the Medea (Jolene Blalock) that Jason will get to meet in the tragedy by Euripides.  The only complaint is that unless you know the background on most of these characters you have no way of appreciating who is sailing with Jason.  A prime example is when Orpheus mentions losing Eurydice but does not tell of how he almost won her back from Hades.  Meanwhile, Atalanta seems to be interested in Jason (what would Artemis say?).But while Matthew Faulk and Mark Skeet get credit for working the ancient sources into this telling of the tale, the problem is that the end result misses the magic of the Harryhausen version.  The problem is twofold.  First, the tenor of the story has contradictory impulses.  On the one hand we have the active participation of the gods, with Hera (Olivia Williams) and Zeus (Angus MacFadyen) aiding and hindering Jason in his quest as they work out one of their frequent marital spats.  But on the other hand there is an effort to make the story more realistic, in terms of the politics and relationships, which works against the idea of being the playthings of the gods.  None of the actors strike heroic poses or speak in grand phrases and even Dennis Hopper is remarkable restrained in his performance.  ""Jason and the Argonauts"" tries to reconcile these two by having the gods work behind the scenes for the most part, but then Poseidon stands up and that idea is quickly dispatched.Second, Jason London as the title character looks too young.  I know the actor was 28 when he made this mini-series but he seems like a youth.  One of the problems with the story was while the greatest heroes in Greece would come to sail with Jason, a callow youth, which Apollonius solved by having Hera make them all want to go.  Instead Faulk and Skeet have Jason make up have the crew with undesirables, some of whom provide comic relief, helped because of the aid of the guard who saved him from death as a youth.  In other words, Jason leads the Argonauts because that is what was written in the script.  Granted, this is consistent with the tone of the mini-series, but you cannot help but think that when Jason meets Medea that she is going to eat him alive (of course, she does much worse, but that is another tragedy).  The end result is a production of ""Jason and the Argonauts"" that lacks the sense of heroic adventure that the tale personifies in classical mythology.  It was okay and it should have been fantastic.",3,More fidelity to the classical myth but no sense of epic,1056326400,"06 23, 2003",2003,3349,"['someone', 'who', 'Classical', 'Greek', 'Roman', 'Mythology', 'impossible', 'sit', 'something', '2000', 'mini-series', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'constantly', 'thinking', 'fidelity', 'myths', 'antiquity', 'Certainly', 'new', 'version', 'more', 'members', 'Argos', 'crew', '1963', 'film', 'version', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'stop', 'motion', 'animation', 'one', 'beloved', 'films', 'youth', 'time', 'there', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'mighty', 'Hercules', 'Brian', 'Thompson', 'aboard', 'also', 'Orpheus', 'Adrian', 'Lester', 'Atalanta', 'Olga', 'Sosnovska', 'Castor', 'Omid', 'Djalili', 'Pollux', 'John', 'Sharian', 'also', 'have', 'Jason', 'Jason', 'London', 'Argo', 'visiting', 'land', 'Amazons', 'other', 'details', 'epic', 'poem', 'written', 'third-century', 'poet', 'Apollonius', 'Rhodes', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'Jason', 'Pelias', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'taken', 'Pindar', 'also', 'hint', 'Medea', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'Jason', 'will', 'get', 'meet', 'tragedy', 'Euripides', 'only', 'complaint', 'know', 'background', 'most', 'characters', 'have', 'way', 'appreciating', 'who', 'sailing', 'Jason', 'A', 'prime', 'example', 'when', 'Orpheus', 'mentions', 'losing', 'Eurydice', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'almost', 'won', 'back', 'Hades', 'Meanwhile', 'Atalanta', 'be', 'interested', 'Jason', 'what', 'would', 'Artemis', 'say', '.But', 'Matthew', 'Faulk', 'Mark', 'Skeet', 'get', 'credit', 'working', 'ancient', 'sources', 'telling', 'tale', 'problem', 'end', 'result', 'magic', 'Harryhausen', 'version', 'problem', 'twofold', 'First', 'tenor', 'story', 'contradictory', 'impulses', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'active', 'participation', 'gods', 'Hera', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Zeus', 'Angus', 'MacFadyen', 'aiding', 'hindering', 'Jason', 'quest', 'work', 'out', 'one', 'frequent', 'marital', 'spats', 'other', 'hand', 'effort', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'realistic', 'terms', 'politics', 'relationships', 'idea', 'being', 'playthings', 'gods', 'None', 'actors', 'strike', 'heroic', 'speak', 'grand', 'phrases', 'even', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'remarkable', 'restrained', 'performance', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'reconcile', 'two', 'having', 'gods', 'work', 'scenes', 'most', 'part', 'then', 'Poseidon', 'up', 'idea', 'quickly', 'dispatched.Second', 'Jason', 'London', 'title', 'character', 'too', 'young', 'know', 'actor', 'was', '28', 'when', 'made', 'mini-series', 'youth', 'One', 'problems', 'story', 'was', 'greatest', 'heroes', 'Greece', 'would', 'come', 'sail', 'Jason', 'callow', 'youth', 'Apollonius', 'solved', 'having', 'Hera', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'Instead', 'Faulk', 'Skeet', 'have', 'Jason', 'make', 'up', 'have', 'crew', 'undesirables', 'whom', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'helped', 'aid', 'guard', 'who', 'saved', 'death', 'youth', 'other', 'words', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'what', 'was', 'written', 'script', 'Granted', 'consistent', 'tone', 'mini-series', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'when', 'Jason', 'Medea', 'going', 'eat', 'alive', 'course', 'much', 'worse', 'tragedy', 'end', 'result', 'production', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'sense', 'heroic', 'adventure', 'tale', 'personifies', 'classical', 'mythology', 'was', 'okay', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic']",Jason and the Argonauts
551514,A3013MHSQS4Y8Y,B00004U28P,lobohombreriera,"[5, 6]","Along with ""Merlin"" and ""The Odyssey"", ""Jason and the Argonauts"" is one of the greatest fantasy mini-series ever made by Hallmark Channel. It also had to fill very big shoes: the classic 1963 movie was too good to forget, specially because of the incredible stop-motion work by Ray Harryhousen. This version rises up to that challenge and goes all the way. Without trying to top the magnificence of the previous version, it gives the story a much more ""serious"" approach, by giving special atention to the production. This 3-hour long miniseries was shot on location in Turkey, where the actual myth is set in!! Also, the production design deserves five stars. I can assure you that the wardrobe, the weapons, the ships and the buildings are almost 100% accurate! (they really did their homework with those soldiers storming the village in the opening sequence) The cast is supreme, specially the actor who plays Zeus, the king of the Olympian gods. Many interesting characters also make appearances, even though they are not quite exactly like they are portrayed in Greek Mithology (Hercules, for example, serves the Goddess Hera, and Castor and Polux are a couple of clowns). The special effects are great too, even better than they were in ""Merlin"", and you know that's pretty hard to do. One thing: if you've watched the Harryhousen version, check out the scene were Jason fights the warriors born from the dragon's teeth (they were skeletons in the 1963 version). This part is definite proof of how cautious were the producers of this miniseries when they decided to stand up to that fantasy-classic.Unfortunately, for such a good movie, you'd think they could've come up with a better edition. There are almost no features at all, and there aren't even subtitles of any kind. Even so, if you are a fantasy fan, or a Greek Mythology fan, or an adventure fan of any kind, don't hesitate with this movie. You can't go wrong! In fact, I didn't give it five stars only because I can't give six to the Harryhousen version.",4,Too good for TV!,1027728000,"07 27, 2002",2002,2022,"['Merlin', 'Odyssey', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'one', 'greatest', 'fantasy', 'mini-series', 'ever', 'made', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'also', 'had', 'fill', 'very', 'big', 'shoes', 'classic', '1963', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'forget', 'specially', 'incredible', 'stop-motion', 'work', 'Ray', 'Harryhousen', 'version', 'up', 'challenge', 'way', 'trying', 'top', 'magnificence', 'previous', 'version', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'approach', 'giving', 'special', 'atention', 'production', '3-hour', 'long', 'miniseries', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Turkey', 'where', 'actual', 'myth', 'set', 'Also', 'production', 'design', 'five', 'stars', 'can', 'assure', 'wardrobe', 'weapons', 'ships', 'buildings', 'are', 'almost', '100', '%', 'accurate', 'really', 'did', 'homework', 'soldiers', 'storming', 'village', 'opening', 'sequence', 'cast', 'supreme', 'specially', 'actor', 'who', 'Zeus', 'king', 'Olympian', 'gods', 'Many', 'interesting', 'characters', 'also', 'make', 'appearances', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'exactly', 'are', 'portrayed', 'Greek', 'Mithology', 'Hercules', 'example', 'Goddess', 'Hera', 'Castor', 'Polux', 'are', 'couple', 'clowns', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'even', 'better', 'were', 'Merlin', 'know', 'pretty', 'hard', 'do', 'One', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Harryhousen', 'version', 'check', 'out', 'scene', 'were', 'Jason', 'fights', 'warriors', 'born', 'dragon', 'teeth', 'were', 'skeletons', '1963', 'version', 'part', 'definite', 'proof', 'how', 'cautious', 'were', 'producers', 'miniseries', 'when', 'decided', 'stand', 'up', 'fantasy-classic.Unfortunately', 'good', 'movie', ""'d"", 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'come', 'up', 'better', 'edition', 'are', 'almost', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'subtitles', 'kind', 'Even', 'so', 'are', 'fantasy', 'fan', 'Greek', 'Mythology', 'fan', 'adventure', 'fan', 'kind', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'only', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'six', 'Harryhousen', 'version']",Jason and the Argonauts
551515,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B00004U28P,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[99, 104]","I was pleasantly surprised to find this version of JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS as a worthy successor to the original film starring Todd Armstrong.I admit I was expecting some cheesy, low budget, badly-acted made-for-tv series but was pleased to find an entertaining film that stays faithful to the original myth. Add to that a strong cast, good production values and impressive special effects and you have a film that you will want to watch again and again.The story centers on Jason (Jason London), who returns to reclaim his kingdom from his uncle, Pelias (Dennis Hopper).  In order to regain the throne and save his mother's life, Jason agrees to sail to Colchis and obtain the golden fleece. With a crew that includes Orpheus, Atalanta, the mighty Hercules and the shipbuilder Argos, Jason faces many dangers on his quest for the fleece.  The argonauts encounter the bronze giant Talos, the women of Lemnos (led by their queen Hypsypile - Natasha Henstridge), blind Phineas (Derek Jacobi) and the frightening harpies, the clashing rocks and more. When Jason arrives in Colchis, he falls in love with the lovely Medea (Jolene Blalock) but must face more challenges (including its ruler, King Aertes - Frank Langella) before he can leave the island with the fleece.This version is more faithful to the myth than the 1963 film. For instance, Orpheus, Atalanta, Castor and Pollux make their appearance here.  Also, this version shows what happens when the argonauts return home and has a better, more tightly woven ending than the original. The special effects are impressive and I enjoyed the behind-the-scenes bickering between Zeus (Angus MacFadyen) and Hera (the lovely Olivia Williams). I also thought that this version's Hercules (Brian Thompson) was a lot more convincing than Nigel Green from the original. This film also does a great job of portraying the role of the gods in Jason's quest.However, there are also a few weaknesses. For one, I certainly miss the Talos of the original. Watching Talos first come to life on the 1963 film still gives me goosebumps up to this day.  That Talos was definitely one of Ray Harryhausen's greatest creations.  I also preferred the many-headed hydra to this version's giant lizard-like creature.  Jason London is a passable lead but I believe the filmmakers could've picked a stronger actor. He certainly is nice to look at and the supporting actors more than make up for his shortcomings.All in all, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to those who enjoy mythological, fantasy or action/adventure films.  For those who enjoy Greek mythology, I suggest you also check out the 1963 version of JASON OF THE ARGONAUTS if only to see the fantastic Talos and the army of skeleton soldiers as well as CLASH OF THE TITANS (starring Harry Hamlin) and upcoming film TROY (starring Brad Pitt).  Edith Hamilton's book MYTHOLOGY: TIMELESS TALES OF GODS AND HEROES is also a great introduction to the wonderful world of Greek and Roman myths and legends.",4,A rousing adventure tale!

Handsomely filmed and epically proportioned, JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS is a rousing, sometimes outstanding, version of this classic Greek myth.  Nick Willing keeps the action moving fairly quickly, although at times it seems to outstay its welcome in terms of length.  A surplus of padded shots including the hull of the Argos traipsing through the waters.  Most of the special effects are very good:  I particularly liked having Zeus and Hera in the heavens; it was not only metaphorically neat, but it was visually beautiful as well.  Angus McFadyen as Zeus and Olivia Williams as Hera looked divine.  The special effect that was below par was the mechanical bull; it seemed not only anachronistically out of place, but it looked cheesy.  Also, the skeletons were nowhere near as frightening as those in Harryhausen's version (oops, I slipped and made a comparison!).  The others, however, particularly the Harpies and Poseidon were ingenuous.Brian Thompson's Hercules was the best performance; he seemed not only gigantically strong, but his bragging about his historic seven deeds was a nice addition.  Dennis Hopper was basically boring as the evil king, and Frank Langella wasn't strong enough either.  Natasha Henstridge's bit as the Amazon queen was fetching.  The main problem with the cast was Jason London, who did not have the maturity or strength to carry the role.  He seemed like a weak leader, one I would have been remiss to follow.  London just doesn't have the chops to play such an integral role.Overall, though, it's an entertaining version of the myth and looked sumptuous.

Horrendous if you are looking for accuracy to the original myths. Or cool CGI. The dragons' teeth soldiers/Jason were pretty bad. Clearly you had Jason ducking, jumping, etc. and these CGI animations drawn in around him as a reaction to him instead of vice-versa. Which is really sad since I am sure it ate into their budget and it ended up just not looking very good. The lizard non-hydra hydra was a bit more nicely done. Almost forgot the smashing rocks scene was kind of uneven (how far exactly are they from the end?). Nicely done CGI I thought, but the various perspectives in the scenes (focus on them rowing and the end is still far off and the rocks are now coming together) don't work out to them getting through there fast enough (and all of a sudden they are coming out).A few things I enjoyed was Hercules as the 'uncle at get-togethers' relating tales of past exploits to anyone who will listen... and roll their eyes and shake their heads when he's not looking.

551519,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00004U28P,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[7, 7]","Jason and the Argonaunts is probably one of the best-known Greek myths, and this movie tells it adequately. Jason London plays Jason, the son of King Aeson and Queen Polymele (Diana Kent) whose kingdom is overrun by Aeson's evil brother Pelias (Dennis Hopper) who kills Aeson and marries Polymele. Jason however, manages to escape, and is brought up by the centaur Chiron in a peaceful enviroment where he has no memory of his violent past except for images that appear to him in dreams. When Chiron finally tells him the truth, giving him a necklace of his mother which displays the sign of Hera, queen of the gods, Jason sets off to reclaim his destiny. Once home he finds his kingdom downtrodden and poverty-stricken as Pelias sends more and more men to their doom in the quest for his greatest desire - the Golden Fleece. When Jason appears, Pelias strikes a deal - Jason will fetch him the Fleece, or else his mother's life will be forfeit.And so the journey begins - on board the ship The Argo, with a hand-picked crew that includes the musician Orpheus, the huntess Atalanta, the mightly Hercules and eagle-eyed Zetes, Jason and his men face dangers such as harpies, the sea-god Poseidon, man-killing Amazons and rocks that crush anything that sails between them. But they are being watched - the sorceress Medea, the protecter of the Fleece has her eye on 'the boy with the pleasent face', and her father and suspicious brother are concerned for the safety of their precious Fleece.The first half of these movie is exellent, and very accurately portrayed in accordance to the myths, (ie Jason's missing sandal, Chiron, and Hera's disguise). I was especially impressed that they called the love god by his Greek name - Eros, instead of the Roman Cupid, which is a mistake that many people make. The second half however changes a little - it is Jason and the crew attempting to snatch the Fleece on enemy territory. They are more liberal with making changes to the original story (for instance Hercules describes himself as being sent to protect Jason by Hera - however, Hera hated Hercules in the myths!). I also felt there was an unsatisfactory ending with two many loose ends that weren't tied up.However, the battle scenes were good (though I'm sure I spotted someone being killed with a javelin that never touched him), as were the special effects, sets and very historically accurate costumes. Some people claim Jason London wasn't very good as Jason, but he could have been worse, and Jolene Blalock made Medea an interesting heroine (though they understandably cut down on Medea's original bloodthirstiness). All scenes that involved Zeus and Hera in Mount Olympus were wonderful, with the clouds reflecting their moods, as was the scene in which Zeus attempts to seduce Medea. Also watch out for Natasha Henstridge as Hypsipyle, Queen of the Amazons.So overall, this is a good enough movie to watch more than once, though in my opinion the first half is much better than the second, and they could have done a better job of completing sub-plots (such as Atalanta's secret love for Jason) to make it a more rounded-up ending.",3,Good enough Voyage to take,1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,3139,"['Jason', 'Argonaunts', 'probably', 'one', 'best-known', 'Greek', 'myths', 'movie', 'adequately', 'Jason', 'London', 'Jason', 'son', 'King', 'Aeson', 'Queen', 'Polymele', 'Diana', 'Kent', 'kingdom', 'overrun', 'Aeson', 'evil', 'brother', 'Pelias', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'who', 'Aeson', 'marries', 'Polymele', 'Jason', 'however', 'escape', 'brought', 'up', 'centaur', 'Chiron', 'peaceful', 'enviroment', 'where', 'memory', 'violent', 'past', 'images', 'appear', 'dreams', 'When', 'Chiron', 'finally', 'truth', 'giving', 'necklace', 'mother', 'sign', 'Hera', 'queen', 'gods', 'Jason', 'reclaim', 'destiny', 'Once', 'home', 'kingdom', 'downtrodden', 'poverty-stricken', 'Pelias', 'more', 'more', 'men', 'doom', 'quest', 'greatest', 'desire', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'When', 'Jason', 'Pelias', 'deal', 'Jason', 'will', 'fetch', 'Fleece', 'else', 'mother', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'forfeit.And', 'so', 'journey', 'board', 'ship', 'Argo', 'hand-picked', 'crew', 'musician', 'Orpheus', 'huntess', 'Atalanta', 'mightly', 'Hercules', 'eagle-eyed', 'Zetes', 'Jason', 'men', 'face', 'dangers', 'such', 'harpies', 'sea-god', 'Poseidon', 'man-killing', 'Amazons', 'rocks', 'crush', 'anything', 'are', 'being', 'watched', 'sorceress', 'Medea', 'protecter', 'Fleece', 'eye', ""'the"", 'boy', 'pleasent', 'face', 'father', 'suspicious', 'brother', 'are', 'concerned', 'safety', 'precious', 'Fleece.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'exellent', 'very', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'accordance', 'myths', 'ie', 'Jason', 'missing', 'sandal', 'Chiron', 'Hera', 'disguise', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'called', 'love', 'god', 'Greek', 'name', 'Eros', 'instead', 'Roman', 'Cupid', 'mistake', 'many', 'people', 'make', 'second', 'half', 'however', 'little', 'Jason', 'crew', 'attempting', 'snatch', 'Fleece', 'enemy', 'territory', 'are', 'more', 'liberal', 'making', 'changes', 'original', 'story', 'instance', 'Hercules', 'being', 'sent', 'protect', 'Jason', 'Hera', 'however', 'Hera', 'hated', 'Hercules', 'myths', 'also', 'felt', 'was', 'unsatisfactory', 'ending', 'two', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'were', ""n't"", 'tied', 'up.However', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', ""'m"", 'sure', 'spotted', 'someone', 'being', 'killed', 'javelin', 'never', 'touched', 'were', 'special', 'effects', 'sets', 'very', 'historically', 'accurate', 'costumes', 'people', 'claim', 'Jason', 'London', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Jason', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'made', 'Medea', 'interesting', 'heroine', 'understandably', 'cut', 'down', 'Medea', 'original', 'bloodthirstiness', 'scenes', 'involved', 'Zeus', 'Hera', 'Mount', 'Olympus', 'were', 'wonderful', 'clouds', 'reflecting', 'moods', 'was', 'scene', 'Zeus', 'attempts', 'seduce', 'Medea', 'Also', 'watch', 'out', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'Hypsipyle', 'Queen', 'Amazons.So', 'overall', 'good', 'enough', 'movie', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'opinion', 'first', 'half', 'much', 'better', 'second', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'completing', 'sub-plots', 'such', 'Atalanta', 'secret', 'love', 'Jason', 'make', 'more', 'rounded-up', 'ending']",Jason and the Argonauts
551520,AJ2RU4VJ470IU,B00004U28P,Robert Law,"[16, 17]","This made-for-television film based on the Greek tale never quite seems to know where it&#65533;s headed. It is visually exciting, however, and it seems almost certain that this is exactly what the filmmakers were looking for that they might be able to hide the film&#65533;s flaws behind a morass of half-naked Amazon women, computer-generated dragons, harpies, and gorgon bulls.The story revolves around the vengeance-seeking young man named Jason (played in a very cardboard manner by Jason London) who finds himself setting sail on a ship called the Argo (with the hand-picked crew known as Argonauts, of course) to fetch the Golden Fleece. Along the way, of course, in the tradition of such tales, there are many adventures and encounters with gods, men, and unnatural beasties. There is a love story of sorts hidden in there somewhere as well, but it&#65533;s quite unsympathetic. ...The acting in Jason and the Argonauts ranges from shoddy to pretty good. Even the respectable actors acquired for the film sometimes manage to turn in pretty unstable performances. Dennis Hopper plays the villain of the piece (not surprisingly), the arch-enemy of Jason, and he seems to have a thing for embracing people and then stabbing them in the back. Frankly, it is a silly role, and played just so. There are other characters even more absurd  - one who has the keenest eyes in the land and shouts &#65533;I see it!&#65533; every five seconds which is both annoying and laughable. But on the other side of the coin, there are characters that manage to keep Jason and the Argonauts interesting, such as Hercules (a very non-Kevin Sorbo performance that is pretty fun), the minstrel, and the bodyguard of Jason&#65533;s father who seeks redemption. Anguss McFadyen (who played Robert the Bruce so beautifully in Braveheart) also stars briefly as King of the Gods, Zeus. It is nice to see Anguss again.Jason and the Argonauts fails in many ways, but usually compensates in others to round out the experience somewhat. After all, a movie based on a Greek myth such as this does not have to be believable all the time, nor does it require the best actors ever assembled. This is a good thing, since the acting and the writing is so hit-and-miss. Fortunately, the adventure elements of any Greek tale such as this are here, and with them in tact there is entertainment to be had. I for one enjoy watching and waiting just to see what the Argonauts will stumble upon next - will it be a god or a monster, or a feud with men over the Golden Fleece? The battles and creature effects may not be cutting-edge, but they have impressive moments. The dragon who guards the Fleece is the creature highlight, and at times looks strikingly real, and the battle against Hopper&#65533;s troops at the end is climactic enough.All in all, Jason and the Argonauts is an enjoyable, if sometimes silly, fantasy with fairly high production values for a film of its type - complete with a wide range of adventures that any adaptation of a Greek myth should have. It&#65533;s not as good as the earlier production of The Odyssey, but it&#65533;s a voyage to consider.",3,A Voyage Worth Taking...,998265600,"08 20, 2001",2001,3137,"['made-for-television', 'film', 'based', 'Greek', 'tale', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'where', '65533', 's', 'headed', 'visually', 'exciting', 'however', 'almost', 'certain', 'exactly', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'looking', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'hide', 'film', '65533', 's', 'flaws', 'morass', 'half-naked', 'Amazon', 'women', 'computer-generated', 'dragons', 'harpies', 'gorgon', 'bulls.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'vengeance-seeking', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Jason', 'played', 'very', 'cardboard', 'manner', 'Jason', 'London', 'who', 'setting', 'sail', 'ship', 'called', 'Argo', 'hand-picked', 'crew', 'known', 'Argonauts', 'course', 'fetch', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'way', 'course', 'tradition', 'such', 'tales', 'are', 'many', 'adventures', 'encounters', 'gods', 'men', 'unnatural', 'beasties', 'love', 'story', 'sorts', 'hidden', 'there', 'somewhere', 'as', 'well', '65533', 'quite', 'unsympathetic', 'acting', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'shoddy', 'pretty', 'good', 'Even', 'respectable', 'actors', 'acquired', 'film', 'sometimes', 'manage', 'turn', 'pretty', 'unstable', 'performances', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'villain', 'piece', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'arch-enemy', 'Jason', 'have', 'thing', 'embracing', 'people', 'then', 'stabbing', 'back', 'Frankly', 'silly', 'role', 'played', 'just', 'so', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'even', 'more', 'absurd', 'one', 'who', 'keenest', 'eyes', 'land', '65533', 'see', '65533', 'five', 'seconds', 'annoying', 'laughable', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'are', 'characters', 'manage', 'keep', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'interesting', 'such', 'Hercules', 'very', 'non-Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'performance', 'pretty', 'fun', 'minstrel', 'bodyguard', 'Jason', '65533', 'father', 'who', 'redemption', 'Anguss', 'McFadyen', 'who', 'played', 'Robert', 'Bruce', 'so', 'beautifully', 'Braveheart', 'also', 'briefly', 'King', 'Gods', 'Zeus', 'nice', 'see', 'Anguss', 'again.Jason', 'Argonauts', 'fails', 'many', 'ways', 'usually', 'compensates', 'others', 'round', 'out', 'experience', 'somewhat', 'movie', 'based', 'Greek', 'myth', 'such', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'believable', 'time', 'require', 'best', 'actors', 'ever', 'assembled', 'good', 'thing', 'acting', 'writing', 'so', 'hit-and-miss', 'Fortunately', 'adventure', 'elements', 'Greek', 'tale', 'such', 'are', 'here', 'tact', 'entertainment', 'be', 'had', 'one', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'waiting', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'Argonauts', 'will', 'stumble', 'next', 'will', 'be', 'god', 'monster', 'feud', 'men', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'battles', 'creature', 'effects', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cutting-edge', 'have', 'impressive', 'moments', 'dragon', 'who', 'Fleece', 'creature', 'highlight', 'times', 'looks', 'strikingly', 'real', 'battle', 'Hopper', '65533', 's', 'troops', 'end', 'climactic', 'enough.All', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'enjoyable', 'sometimes', 'silly', 'fantasy', 'fairly', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'type', 'complete', 'wide', 'range', 'adventures', 'adaptation', 'Greek', 'myth', 'should', 'have', '65533', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'earlier', 'production', 'Odyssey', '65533', 's', 'voyage', 'consider']",Jason and the Argonauts
