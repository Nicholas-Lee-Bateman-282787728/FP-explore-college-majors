Some of the interview subjects, such as the D.A. guy, I found to be a little irritating and boring.Anatomy of a Prison Murder is an intense and involving story that presents the dire realities of prison life and how one young man chose to take the darkest route to the pits of prison hell.",4,Chow hall can be hazardous to your health..,1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,697,"['am', 'always', 'sucker', 'good', 'prison', 'story', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'present', 'intense', 'grim', 'real-life', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'managed', 'screw', 'life', 'getting', 'life-time', 'prison', 'sentence', 'then', 'proceed', 'shank', 'inmate', 'bloody', 'death.Along', 'actual', 'story', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'viewing', 'prison', 'riot', 'scenes', 'truly', 'how', 'tense', 'dangerous', 'prison', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'interview', 'subjects', 'such', 'D.A', 'guy', 'found', 'be', 'little', 'irritating', 'boring.Anatomy', 'Prison', 'Murder', 'intense', 'involving', 'story', 'dire', 'realities', 'prison', 'life', 'how', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'chose', 'take', 'darkest', 'route', 'pits', 'prison', 'hell']",Gladiator Days - Anatomy of a Prison Murder

723164,A22FFXBR4U3S8X,B00006SFKG,Michael B. Green,"[0, 0]","If you can stand a realistically grim and gritty view of both a superficially charming racist psychopathic killer and the penal system that supported his cold-blooded killing of a black inmate, this is a rewarding movie.  Anthony Kell's murder of the black inmate says at least as much about the racist institutional support for the killing as it does about Kell.  Listen carefully to how the victim was set up to be sent to hospital infirmary even though he was not ill; listen carefully to how the prison guards watched without intervening as Kell's friend held the victim down and Kell stabbed him over-and-over during the prolonged course of many minutes until he gradually bled to death.  The guards, instead of intervening, were filming the murder - the video of the killing is the grisly highlight of this movie - but doing nothing until after Kell rose in exultation and started celebrating.  No guards were disciplined, and the in-prison cooperation to make the referral to the infirmary was never addressed.The young Tony Kell and his ""philosophy"" is briefly but fruitfully explored, and then there is a telling narrative of the very vacant inner man.  In a wonderful moment Kell reflects upon his motives for committing the murder that put him in prison in the first place: Kell doesn't really know why he did it.  He was just going to rough up a man who was hounding a young neighborhood female friend of his, but brought a gun to the event, and then well... things happened.  You can see how loosely connected most of the group of murdering youngsters were to social consequences; the crime would have gone unsolved but for the fact that one of the killers kept bringing friends back to see the body to prove his boast of what he had done. The female friend, herself convicted as co-conspirator, adds a poignant contrast.  She is neither evil nor violent, and if she hadn't complained to Tony about the man harassing her she would have grown up fairly normally and not have spent most of her life behind bars.",4,Intimate view of a psychopath and a prison hell-hole,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,2022,"['can', 'stand', 'realistically', 'grim', 'gritty', 'view', 'superficially', 'charming', 'racist', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'penal', 'system', 'supported', 'cold-blooded', 'killing', 'black', 'inmate', 'rewarding', 'movie', 'Anthony', 'Kell', 'murder', 'black', 'inmate', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'racist', 'institutional', 'support', 'killing', 'Kell', 'Listen', 'carefully', 'how', 'victim', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'sent', 'hospital', 'infirmary', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'ill', 'listen', 'carefully', 'how', 'prison', 'guards', 'watched', 'intervening', 'Kell', 'friend', 'held', 'victim', 'down', 'Kell', 'stabbed', 'over-and-over', 'prolonged', 'course', 'many', 'minutes', 'gradually', 'bled', 'death', 'guards', 'instead', 'intervening', 'were', 'filming', 'murder', 'video', 'killing', 'grisly', 'highlight', 'movie', 'doing', 'nothing', 'Kell', 'rose', 'exultation', 'started', 'celebrating', 'guards', 'were', 'disciplined', 'in-prison', 'cooperation', 'make', 'referral', 'infirmary', 'was', 'never', 'addressed.The', 'young', 'Tony', 'Kell', 'philosophy', 'briefly', 'fruitfully', 'explored', 'then', 'telling', 'narrative', 'very', 'vacant', 'inner', 'man', 'wonderful', 'moment', 'Kell', 'motives', 'committing', 'murder', 'put', 'prison', 'first', 'place', 'Kell', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'did', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'rough', 'up', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'hounding', 'young', 'neighborhood', 'female', 'friend', 'brought', 'gun', 'event', 'then', 'well', 'things', 'happened', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'loosely', 'connected', 'most', 'group', 'murdering', 'youngsters', 'were', 'social', 'consequences', 'crime', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'unsolved', 'fact', 'one', 'killers', 'kept', 'bringing', 'friends', 'back', 'see', 'body', 'prove', 'boast', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'female', 'friend', 'convicted', 'co-conspirator', 'poignant', 'contrast', 'evil', 'violent', 'had', ""n't"", 'complained', 'Tony', 'man', 'harassing', 'would', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'fairly', 'normally', 'not', 'have', 'spent', 'most', 'life', 'bars']",Gladiator Days - Anatomy of a Prison Murder

As someone interested in the subject matter I think it addresses a variety of issues: racial issues, delinquency, juvenile housing, gang violence, lockup procedures,and criminality in general. I think it also addresses some of the stereotypes concerning criminals and criminal behavior. Troy Kell is the perfect example of someone who came from a decent family, educated and had all the tools for success, and yet ended up on death row (1st killing a guy over some foolishness and then committing a murder while in prison). I think even to the average person, they would find Kell charasmatic, charming (oops, that is the same thing), with no regrets or excuses.

What I disagree with is that the murder was racially motivated. Someone that hasn't done serious time will never understand that it was mutually agreed between his victim and Troy that one of them had to die. It's just that Troy was more devious and effective. He would have done the same to a white opponent that challenged him. His reference to the guards about watch this act referred to his testimony at the trial not the apology to the victim's family.
