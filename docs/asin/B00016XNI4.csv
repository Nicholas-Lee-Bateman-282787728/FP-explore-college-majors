I was rooting for her the whole time, since she was able-bodied, younger, and without children or a man.  Minimum wage doesn't cut it and something should be done to assure that everyone has a decent, yet humble, home.

794488,A2FNE3CGLVMHB3,B00016XNI4,"Brooke ""islandr1""","[6, 7]","After publishing my book ""Shadow Women: Homeless Women's Survival Stories"" (Sheed & Ward, 1990), I had many offers from producers, directors, and stars for a movie contract.  An error by my publisher resulted in my choice of director, and Ohayon approached me, begging for the rights in exchange for fundraisers for my 501(c)nonprofit org: Women Organized Against Homelessness. She said that by giving her the rights to a film, her org, Cinewomen, would have their first break in the ""Old Boy's Net"" in Hollywood.  I believed her, helped her find some undetectable homeless women, and was in the film for a comment. The original product ""thanked my org and me for my input.""  It has been deleted and Ohayon never fulfilled her promise.  She has taken all of the credit for my long years of research, doctoral dissertation on the topic, and books published.  She appeared on Oprah, taking credit for my work.I did appear on ""60 Minutes"" (1992) with some undetectable homeless women, and it was a disaster.  Practically no one believed that such people exist -- living amongst us without our knowledge of their situations.  It didn't help that CBS deleted the solutions posited by these women and focused only on exploiting how they were living out of personalized vehicles in Beverly Hills and Malibu.As for helping these women who are trying to be self-sufficient, my org members have been doing so since 1982.  I was one of this subculture of the larger homeless population in the 1970s.  I lived on a deserted island for a long time before I thought of asking for a fully-financed Ph.D. from my ""old"" university.  I have websites that describe who these women are and how they are surviving. If there are any questions, just type in my name on Google and find out more information.This doc was made without any creative control on my part and I do not think it was well done. The woman on the cover and the doc's ""star"" was a very visible ""street person,"" living in a junk-filled vehicle that would not be typical of this subculture.  The doc does tell the truth about a previously unknown population, but in the 2000 era, there are now also many men using the same tactics that women have used for decades.  The major economic downturn has created so many more people who are living in alternative housing and creating self-employment. (My other book, ""Organizational and Community Responses to Domestic Abuse and Homelessness"" (Garland, 1994) is more apt to be of importance to housing and org professionals.)I have raw film waiting for editing for two docs that show how to alleviate homelessness among all stable homeless people. I have a historical model to use in every state where homeless people can live and work with sweat equity and self-sufficiency.  It is already being accomplished.",3,I Wrote the Book From Which This Doc Was Made:,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,2798,"['publishing', 'book', 'Shadow', 'Women', 'Homeless', 'Women', 'Survival', 'Stories', 'Sheed', 'Ward', '1990', 'had', 'many', 'offers', 'producers', 'directors', 'stars', 'movie', 'contract', 'error', 'publisher', 'resulted', 'choice', 'director', 'Ohayon', 'approached', 'begging', 'rights', 'exchange', 'fundraisers', '501', 'c', 'nonprofit', 'org', 'Women', 'Organized', 'Against', 'Homelessness', 'said', 'giving', 'rights', 'film', 'org', 'Cinewomen', 'would', 'have', 'first', 'break', 'Old', 'Boy', 'Net', 'Hollywood', 'believed', 'helped', 'find', 'undetectable', 'homeless', 'women', 'was', 'film', 'comment', 'original', 'product', 'thanked', 'org', 'input', 'been', 'deleted', 'Ohayon', 'never', 'fulfilled', 'promise', 'taken', 'credit', 'long', 'years', 'research', 'doctoral', 'dissertation', 'topic', 'books', 'published', 'appeared', 'Oprah', 'taking', 'credit', 'work.I', 'did', 'appear', '60', 'Minutes', '1992', 'undetectable', 'homeless', 'women', 'was', 'disaster', 'Practically', 'one', 'believed', 'such', 'people', 'exist', 'living', 'amongst', 'knowledge', 'situations', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'CBS', 'deleted', 'solutions', 'posited', 'women', 'focused', 'only', 'exploiting', 'how', 'were', 'living', 'personalized', 'vehicles', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Malibu.As', 'helping', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'be', 'self-sufficient', 'org', 'members', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'so', '1982', 'was', 'one', 'subculture', 'larger', 'homeless', 'population', '1970s', 'lived', 'deserted', 'island', 'long', 'time', 'thought', 'asking', 'fully-financed', 'Ph.D.', 'old', 'university', 'have', 'websites', 'describe', 'who', 'women', 'are', 'how', 'are', 'surviving', 'are', 'questions', 'just', 'type', 'name', 'Google', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'information.This', 'doc', 'was', 'made', 'creative', 'control', 'part', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'woman', 'cover', 'doc', 'star', 'was', 'very', 'visible', 'street', 'person', 'living', 'junk-filled', 'vehicle', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'typical', 'subculture', 'doc', 'tell', 'truth', 'previously', 'unknown', 'population', '2000', 'era', 'are', 'now', 'also', 'many', 'men', 'using', 'same', 'tactics', 'women', 'have', 'used', 'decades', 'major', 'economic', 'downturn', 'created', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'alternative', 'housing', 'creating', 'self-employment', 'other', 'book', 'Organizational', 'Community', 'Responses', 'Domestic', 'Abuse', 'Homelessness', 'Garland', '1994', 'more', 'apt', 'be', 'importance', 'housing', 'org', 'professionals', 'have', 'raw', 'film', 'waiting', 'editing', 'two', 'docs', 'show', 'how', 'alleviate', 'homelessness', 'stable', 'homeless', 'people', 'have', 'historical', 'model', 'use', 'state', 'where', 'homeless', 'people', 'can', 'live', 'work', 'sweat', 'equity', 'self-sufficiency', 'already', 'being', 'accomplished']",It Was a Wonderful Life
794489,A21279TEPJ8YJ9,B00016XNI4,"Diaspora Chic ""diaspora_chic""","[6, 6]","Although this documentary was done fifteen years ago, I rented it because of the title. I find it interesting to know how women do end up homeless. I remember Sixty Minutes doing a segment on homeless women when I was in high school. I have to say that these women are more resourceful than a woman who has a job and a home.It's a shame that our legal system can barely do anything to help these women to get back on their feet. Yet, they can respond quickly to high-profile cases that are sometimes too outrageous or frivilous. These were women who had good, if not great lives. They were married with children. Some of them were working to make ends meets and not having to worry about tomorrow. Then something happened.Marital discord, medical injury, loss of employment turned their world upside down. I felt sorry for these women because they were struggling to stay afloat when things took a turn for the worse. Some of them wouldn't turn to their families or friends for assistance; and one didn't have anyone to turn to for assistance.The thought of what these women are going through is a reflection of what can happen to me and several other women. As much as I whined and complained about not having a place of my own and having to struggle financially, there is always a ray of sunshine.The only thing we as women need to do is to acknowledge our presence and look out for our well-being. And help each other.I wonder if there was ever any thought to follow-up on this documentary. One committed suicide and the other was never heard from again. It would be interesting to know what they have been doing since this documentary was made.",5,Great Documentary,1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,1648,"['documentary', 'was', 'done', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'rented', 'title', 'find', 'interesting', 'know', 'how', 'women', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'homeless', 'remember', 'Sixty', 'Minutes', 'doing', 'segment', 'homeless', 'women', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'have', 'say', 'women', 'are', 'more', 'resourceful', 'woman', 'who', 'job', 'home.It', 'shame', 'legal', 'system', 'can', 'barely', 'do', 'anything', 'help', 'women', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'can', 'respond', 'quickly', 'high-profile', 'cases', 'are', 'sometimes', 'too', 'outrageous', 'frivilous', 'were', 'women', 'who', 'had', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'lives', 'were', 'married', 'children', 'were', 'working', 'make', 'ends', 'meets', 'not', 'having', 'worry', 'tomorrow', 'Then', 'something', 'happened.Marital', 'discord', 'medical', 'injury', 'loss', 'employment', 'turned', 'world', 'down', 'felt', 'sorry', 'women', 'were', 'struggling', 'stay', 'afloat', 'when', 'things', 'took', 'turn', 'worse', 'would', ""n't"", 'turn', 'families', 'friends', 'assistance', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anyone', 'turn', 'assistance.The', 'thought', 'what', 'women', 'are', 'going', 'reflection', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'several', 'other', 'women', 'As', 'much', 'whined', 'complained', 'not', 'having', 'place', 'own', 'having', 'struggle', 'financially', 'always', 'ray', 'sunshine.The', 'only', 'thing', 'women', 'need', 'do', 'acknowledge', 'presence', 'look', 'out', 'well-being', 'help', 'other.I', 'wonder', 'was', 'ever', 'thought', 'follow-up', 'documentary', 'One', 'committed', 'suicide', 'other', 'was', 'never', 'heard', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'know', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'documentary', 'was', 'made']",It Was a Wonderful Life
794490,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00016XNI4,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[7, 7]","It Was a Wonderful Life had quite an effect on me--I was troubled by what had happened to these ""hidden homeless"" women who live out of their cars and who dress well enough that if I saw them walking down the street I never would have guessed that they were homeless. The documentary flows at a good pace; I was never bored although I do agree with reviewers who note that it's certainly not the most polished documentary I've ever seen. Honestly, I was unaware of the extent of this problem; the film raised my awareness of this issue and if it was a problem then I can just imagine the extent of the problem in today's ""Great Recession!""We meet several women who actually lead quite a comfortable life--or at least a solidly middle class existence before they ran out of money because of a medical illness that apparently was not covered by insurance (or perhaps they lacked health insurance, they film doesn't go into this), bad investments or deadbeat dads/ex-husbands who simply refused to make their child support payments. These women are remarkably talented artists, teachers, realtors and more and they are every bit as well educated as the filmmakers say that they are; one of them is quite a chanteuse and it pained me greatly to see how she ended up homeless with her hopes and chances for subsidized ""Section 8"" housing dwindled, leaving her in a state of despair and deep depression.We also learn how these women rarely seek out financial support such as food stamps and public assistance--I assume this is out of pride and a strong determination to make their own way. When interviewed, these women didn't think that they were desperate enough to apply for welfare. Granted, there is some discussion about barriers to collecting public assistance but it's not as in-depth as I would have liked it to be.The film doesn't attempt to suggest answers for this problem except in the area of ex-husbands who didn't make child support payments--in that arena they state that there have to be stricter laws to be sure that deadbeat dads make their child support payments in a timely fashion. I would have liked the film more if they had explored potential solutions in more depth but it painted such a strong picture of homeless women living out of their cars (or, in one case, a U-Haul truck at times when Lou, a homeless woman, could afford it) that this will haunt me for quite some time to come.All in all, this is a well done documentary even if it was apparently made on a rather tight budget. I recommend this film for anyone interested in these issues.",4,a thought provoking documentary,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,2567,"['Was', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'had', 'quite', 'effect', 'was', 'troubled', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'hidden', 'homeless', 'women', 'who', 'live', 'cars', 'who', 'dress', 'well', 'enough', 'saw', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'were', 'homeless', 'documentary', 'flows', 'good', 'pace', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'do', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'note', 'certainly', 'not', 'most', 'polished', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Honestly', 'was', 'unaware', 'extent', 'problem', 'film', 'raised', 'awareness', 'issue', 'was', 'problem', 'then', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'extent', 'problem', 'today', 'Great', 'Recession', 'meet', 'several', 'women', 'who', 'actually', 'lead', 'comfortable', 'life', 'least', 'solidly', 'middle', 'class', 'existence', 'ran', 'money', 'medical', 'illness', 'apparently', 'was', 'not', 'covered', 'insurance', 'perhaps', 'lacked', 'health', 'insurance', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'bad', 'investments', 'deadbeat', 'dads/ex-husbands', 'who', 'simply', 'refused', 'make', 'child', 'support', 'payments', 'women', 'are', 'remarkably', 'talented', 'artists', 'teachers', 'realtors', 'more', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'educated', 'filmmakers', 'say', 'are', 'one', 'quite', 'chanteuse', 'pained', 'greatly', 'see', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'homeless', 'hopes', 'chances', 'subsidized', 'Section', '8', 'housing', 'dwindled', 'leaving', 'state', 'despair', 'deep', 'depression.We', 'also', 'learn', 'how', 'women', 'rarely', 'seek', 'out', 'financial', 'support', 'such', 'food', 'stamps', 'public', 'assistance', 'assume', 'pride', 'strong', 'determination', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'When', 'interviewed', 'women', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'desperate', 'enough', 'apply', 'welfare', 'Granted', 'discussion', 'barriers', 'collecting', 'public', 'assistance', 'not', 'as', 'in-depth', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'be.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'suggest', 'answers', 'problem', 'area', 'ex-husbands', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'child', 'support', 'payments', 'arena', 'state', 'there', 'have', 'be', 'stricter', 'laws', 'be', 'sure', 'deadbeat', 'dads', 'make', 'child', 'support', 'payments', 'timely', 'fashion', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'film', 'more', 'had', 'explored', 'potential', 'solutions', 'more', 'depth', 'painted', 'strong', 'picture', 'homeless', 'women', 'living', 'cars', 'one', 'case', 'U-Haul', 'truck', 'times', 'when', 'Lou', 'homeless', 'woman', 'could', 'afford', 'will', 'haunt', 'quite', 'time', 'come.All', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'even', 'was', 'apparently', 'made', 'rather', 'tight', 'budget', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'interested', 'issues']",It Was a Wonderful Life
