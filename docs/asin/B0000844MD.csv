733752,A2KTE6T3YFLI2W,B0000844MD,Action Movie Fan,"[2, 2]","This movie is a 3 star review, but I am rating it 4 stars for Seagal fans. Seagal is sent to prison to build up his credibility so he can later join a criminal group after he serves his time. The prison Seagal is sent to is maximum security on an island. While locked up, a group of armed paramilitary people take control of the prison. Seagal teams up with inmates to fight the paramilitary group. This movie did not have enough action. There are some fight scenes and some gun fights, but not nearly enough. It was not realistic that a maximum security prison could be easily broken into with almost no fight from the security guards. I expected better gun fights between the prison security guards and the paramilitary group. This movie could have been much better than what it turned out to be.",3,"Not great, but not bad",1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,798,"['movie', '3', 'star', 'review', 'am', 'rating', '4', 'stars', 'Seagal', 'fans', 'Seagal', 'sent', 'prison', 'build', 'up', 'credibility', 'can', 'later', 'join', 'criminal', 'group', 'time', 'prison', 'Seagal', 'sent', 'maximum', 'security', 'island', 'locked', 'up', 'group', 'armed', 'paramilitary', 'people', 'take', 'control', 'prison', 'Seagal', 'up', 'inmates', 'fight', 'paramilitary', 'group', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'action', 'are', 'fight', 'scenes', 'gun', 'fights', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'was', 'not', 'realistic', 'maximum', 'security', 'prison', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'broken', 'almost', 'fight', 'security', 'guards', 'expected', 'better', 'gun', 'fights', 'prison', 'security', 'guards', 'paramilitary', 'group', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be']",N/A
733753,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0000844MD,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[10, 15]","For a man that is not feeling well, this was the perfect no brainer film to help me conquer those sweats and chills.  There was unrealistic fighting, a Swiss cheese plot, and characters that we cared nothing for, which allowed me to doze off and still know what was happening.  This was a Steven Seagal film, so I wasn't expecting much, but honestly, after several of his film you come to realize that they are all very similar and Seagal has not changed his fighting habits at all over the years.  He is still using the same fist moves that made him popular in Above the Law.  Why should he change?  He is Steven Seagal.So, take his old-school 1980s fighting techniques and combine it with a modern day rap artist like Ja-Rule (especially after his popularity with DMX in Exit Wounds), and you have the film Half Past Dead.  So, let's begin.  The fighting was laughable.  I think that if a gust of wind hit Ja-Rule he would fly halfway across the room.  Also, why did it become increasingly obvious that Ja-Rule was not doing his own fight sequences?  Throughout his fighting with Nia Peeples, it is very clear that it is not Ja-Rule.  How could a director allow such a blatant error happen in an action film?  This is not the only case of action gone wrong.  There are several scenes in which bullets defy their projected path and gravity.  Also, let us not forget the flying fists of Seagal which had the sounds of some hard hits, but it was very obvious that he was mock fighting with most of the extras.  This unrealistic fighting knocked this film from five stars to four stars.So, let's move past the fighting.  What is a good action film without the story to accompany the fighting?  Sadly, director Don Michael Paul felt as if there was no story needed.  Why bother the audience with a story when we have Ja-Rule and Steven Seagal fighting together on-screen?  The plot was riddled with more holes that my high school underwear.  It was as if we were not seeing the entire picture, and instead of showing us the director relied on words to tell us.  Some examples of what I mean are how Sasha and Nick first met.  I needed to see this.  Without this story and seeing their trust be born, it became less emotional when it was broken.  I didn't care, I needed to know more about them.  The side-story about Seagal's wife was just filler.  He has these visions of her that help him live after a gun battle, but that is all we know about her.  When I first saw this scene, I thought it was going to be a major influence in the film.  Sadly, I believe that was the last mention of the wife.  The Prisoner's story with the gold was horrible.  I didn't know enough about the guy to make me see the evil in his ways.  This ultimately led to an unclimactic ending with this Prisoner.  Does anyone really know who Morris Chestnut's character was?  How did he get the money to finance this operation, and how did he become the inside man?  I needed answers of which Don Michael Paul was not willing to provide.  The lack of story and weakness of the main characters knocked this film from four stars to two.Finally, I would like to comment on the title.  What does it mean?  Was it a reference to the time when Sasha almost died, or is it a reference to the lack of caring about life from Ja-Rule and the inmates (remember his line, ""Tonight is a good time to die"").  I don't know.  This led me to the ultimate conclusion about this film.  The director just didn't care.  He was happy to have Seagal and Ja-Rule signed on, so everything else became second fiddle.  In the range of action films, this is pretty poor.  Unrealistic fighting with an overabundance of cliched lines only plummeted this film deeper into the world of action.  To be brutally honest, Ja-Rule cannot act, and this became a problem in this film.  He needed a smaller film to get his feet wet and see if he was ready for the cinema world.  Half Past Dead was not the best role for him.  This film is the perfect example of a movie made just to get rap artists some screen time and attempt to bring an overweight action start from the 80s into the new generation.  Sadly, in Half Past Dead it didn't work.Grade: * out of *****",1,The jury decided; I presided.,1099958400,"11 9, 2004",2004,4195,"['man', 'not', 'feeling', 'well', 'was', 'perfect', 'brainer', 'film', 'help', 'conquer', 'sweats', 'chills', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'fighting', 'Swiss', 'cheese', 'plot', 'characters', 'cared', 'nothing', 'allowed', 'doze', 'off', 'still', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'was', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'honestly', 'several', 'film', 'come', 'realize', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'Seagal', 'not', 'changed', 'fighting', 'habits', 'years', 'still', 'using', 'same', 'fist', 'moves', 'made', 'popular', 'Above', 'Law', 'Why', 'should', 'change', 'Steven', 'Seagal.So', 'take', 'old-school', '1980s', 'fighting', 'techniques', 'combine', 'modern', 'day', 'rap', 'artist', 'Ja-Rule', 'especially', 'popularity', 'DMX', 'Exit', 'Wounds', 'have', 'film', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', 'So', 'let', 'begin', 'fighting', 'was', 'laughable', 'think', 'gust', 'wind', 'hit', 'Ja-Rule', 'would', 'fly', 'halfway', 'room', 'Also', 'why', 'did', 'become', 'increasingly', 'obvious', 'Ja-Rule', 'was', 'not', 'doing', 'own', 'fight', 'sequences', 'fighting', 'Nia', 'Peeples', 'very', 'clear', 'not', 'Ja-Rule', 'How', 'could', 'director', 'allow', 'blatant', 'error', 'happen', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'case', 'action', 'gone', 'wrong', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'bullets', 'defy', 'projected', 'path', 'gravity', 'Also', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'flying', 'fists', 'Seagal', 'had', 'sounds', 'hard', 'hits', 'was', 'very', 'obvious', 'was', 'mock', 'fighting', 'most', 'extras', 'unrealistic', 'fighting', 'knocked', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'four', 'stars.So', 'let', 'move', 'fighting', 'What', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'story', 'accompany', 'fighting', 'Sadly', 'director', 'Don', 'Michael', 'Paul', 'felt', 'was', 'story', 'needed', 'Why', 'bother', 'audience', 'story', 'when', 'have', 'Ja-Rule', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'fighting', 'together', 'on-screen', 'plot', 'was', 'riddled', 'more', 'holes', 'high', 'school', 'underwear', 'was', 'were', 'not', 'seeing', 'entire', 'picture', 'instead', 'showing', 'director', 'relied', 'words', 'tell', 'examples', 'what', 'mean', 'are', 'how', 'Sasha', 'Nick', 'first', 'met', 'needed', 'see', 'story', 'seeing', 'trust', 'be', 'born', 'became', 'less', 'emotional', 'when', 'was', 'broken', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'needed', 'know', 'more', 'side-story', 'Seagal', 'wife', 'was', 'just', 'filler', 'visions', 'help', 'live', 'gun', 'battle', 'know', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'scene', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'major', 'influence', 'film', 'Sadly', 'believe', 'was', 'last', 'mention', 'wife', 'Prisoner', 'story', 'gold', 'was', 'horrible', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'guy', 'make', 'see', 'evil', 'ways', 'ultimately', 'led', 'unclimactic', 'ending', 'Prisoner', 'Does', 'anyone', 'really', 'know', 'who', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'character', 'was', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'money', 'finance', 'operation', 'how', 'did', 'become', 'inside', 'man', 'needed', 'answers', 'Don', 'Michael', 'Paul', 'was', 'not', 'willing', 'provide', 'lack', 'story', 'weakness', 'main', 'characters', 'knocked', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'two.Finally', 'would', 'like', 'comment', 'title', 'What', 'mean', 'Was', 'reference', 'time', 'when', 'Sasha', 'almost', 'died', 'reference', 'lack', 'caring', 'life', 'Ja-Rule', 'inmates', 'remember', 'line', 'Tonight', 'good', 'time', 'die', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'led', 'ultimate', 'conclusion', 'film', 'director', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'happy', 'have', 'Seagal', 'Ja-Rule', 'signed', 'everything', 'else', 'became', 'second', 'fiddle', 'range', 'action', 'films', 'pretty', 'poor', 'Unrealistic', 'fighting', 'overabundance', 'cliched', 'lines', 'only', 'plummeted', 'film', 'deeper', 'world', 'action', 'be', 'brutally', 'honest', 'Ja-Rule', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'became', 'problem', 'film', 'needed', 'smaller', 'film', 'get', 'feet', 'wet', 'see', 'was', 'ready', 'cinema', 'world', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'role', 'film', 'perfect', 'example', 'movie', 'made', 'just', 'get', 'rap', 'artists', 'screen', 'time', 'attempt', 'bring', 'overweight', 'action', 'start', '80s', 'new', 'generation', 'Sadly', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', 'did', ""n't"", 'work.Grade', '*', '*****']",N/A
733754,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000844MD,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 7]","Sadly when I first saw this train wreck of a movie I must have been drunk because the next day I vaguely remembered it being cool, cool enough to buy and then a week or two later, watching my new glossy DVD sober as can be I realized that this is a mess of a film with rarely a redeeming factor.  The acting is atrocious, enough to make me want to hire hit men to take these so called actors out.  The action, which should be the biggest draw, is nothing more than laughable.  The film rips from so many previous films that did this so much better and the pairing of Seagal and Ja Rule is so humanly wrong that I can't believe I rented the film the first time.  Steven Seagal is a mystery to me.  How he became famous in the first place just about blows my mind, and why anyone figured Ja Rule could act when he can't even rap is just plain bad executive skills.The plot is mumbled and pure Hollywood stupidity, and while there are plenty of good films that rely of plots improbably, some even impossible, just about every other one does it ten times better than this flop.  Seagal is an undercover FBI agent who gets himself incarcerated with a felon, played by Ja Rule, in order to stop a group of criminals from preventing an execution in order to gain a large fortune; at least I think that's what it was about.  It lost my interest and it seemed to confuse itself quite a bit so I could be wrong there.  The criminals, led by Morris Chestnut, are the only redeeming factor.  Chestnut is effective despite the lack of depth in his role, and at least Nia Peeples is hot and can kick amble behind.  They may be a redeeming factor, but that redemption is very short lived and is no where near enough to make this worth watching.After the successful `Exit Wounds' maybe Seagal thought any rapper would make him look good.  The difference between DMX and Ja Rule is that DMX can act to a degree, can fight to a degree and is entertaining to a degree.  Ja Rule is none of the above.  This film is enough reason to swear off anything containing his and or Seagal's name ever again, although I did enjoy `Exit Wounds' quite a bit.  There's just too much gone wrong in this action flick.  It feels like a rushed summer popcorn filler, like the executives at the studio decided to throw an aged action star, a rapper and a hole riddled plot in the hands of an inexperienced director and say ""make us some quick money"".  I don't think they succeeded too much at any end of the equation but then again I don't care too much either.I encourage the reader here to walk away from this case at your local rental store.  It will do nothing more than disappoint and any brief moments of entertainment are not enough o make up for the rest of this deadbeat waste of time and money.  Not to beat a dead horse any longer I'll end this review on that note.  I'm not one to bash a film, heck I always try and find something to write positive but I just couldn't, with sober eyes, find anything in this film I could praise and or use to justify multiple viewings.  I don't think I can even justify the first viewing.  Yes I can, I was drunk and that's justification enough.",1,"Not a thing here to write home about, dense, corny and a complete drag...",1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,3153,"['Sadly', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'train', 'wreck', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'drunk', 'next', 'day', 'vaguely', 'remembered', 'being', 'cool', 'cool', 'enough', 'buy', 'then', 'week', 'two', 'later', 'watching', 'new', 'glossy', 'DVD', 'sober', 'can', 'be', 'realized', 'mess', 'film', 'rarely', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'acting', 'atrocious', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'hire', 'hit', 'men', 'take', 'so', 'called', 'actors', 'out', 'action', 'should', 'be', 'biggest', 'draw', 'nothing', 'more', 'laughable', 'film', 'rips', 'so', 'many', 'previous', 'films', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'pairing', 'Seagal', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'so', 'humanly', 'wrong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'rented', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'mystery', 'How', 'became', 'famous', 'first', 'place', 'just', 'blows', 'mind', 'why', 'anyone', 'figured', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'could', 'act', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'rap', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'executive', 'skills.The', 'plot', 'mumbled', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'stupidity', 'are', 'plenty', 'good', 'films', 'rely', 'plots', 'improbably', 'even', 'impossible', 'just', 'other', 'one', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'flop', 'Seagal', 'undercover', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'incarcerated', 'felon', 'played', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'order', 'stop', 'group', 'criminals', 'preventing', 'execution', 'order', 'gain', 'large', 'fortune', 'least', 'think', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'lost', 'interest', 'seemed', 'confuse', 'quite', 'bit', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'there', 'criminals', 'led', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'are', 'only', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'Chestnut', 'effective', 'lack', 'depth', 'role', 'least', 'Nia', 'Peeples', 'hot', 'can', 'kick', 'amble', 'behind', 'may', 'be', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'redemption', 'very', 'short', 'lived', 'where', 'near', 'enough', 'make', 'worth', 'successful', 'Exit', 'Wounds', 'maybe', 'Seagal', 'thought', 'rapper', 'would', 'make', 'look', 'good', 'difference', 'DMX', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'DMX', 'can', 'act', 'degree', 'can', 'fight', 'degree', 'entertaining', 'degree', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'none', 'above', 'film', 'enough', 'reason', 'swear', 'off', 'anything', 'containing', 'Seagal', 'name', 'ever', 'again', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Exit', 'Wounds', 'quite', 'bit', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'gone', 'wrong', 'action', 'flick', 'rushed', 'summer', 'popcorn', 'filler', 'executives', 'studio', 'decided', 'throw', 'aged', 'action', 'star', 'rapper', 'hole', 'riddled', 'plot', 'hands', 'inexperienced', 'director', 'say', 'make', 'quick', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'succeeded', 'too', 'much', 'end', 'equation', 'then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'either.I', 'encourage', 'reader', 'here', 'walk', 'away', 'case', 'local', 'rental', 'store', 'will', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'disappoint', 'brief', 'moments', 'entertainment', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'o', 'make', 'up', 'rest', 'deadbeat', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'Not', 'beat', 'dead', 'horse', 'longer', ""'ll"", 'end', 'review', 'note', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'bash', 'film', 'heck', 'always', 'try', 'find', 'something', 'write', 'positive', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'sober', 'eyes', 'find', 'anything', 'film', 'could', 'praise', 'use', 'justify', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'even', 'justify', 'first', 'viewing', 'Yes', 'can', 'was', 'drunk', 'justification', 'enough']",N/A

With the exception of Arnie and Bruce, the top action heroes of the 80s and 90s seem to be going direct to DVD these days. Van Damme. Sly. Chuck. Even some of Jackie's movies. And of course Steven Seagal- graduate of the Chuck Norris School of Non-Acting. A man who talks softly and hits hard.Seagal's latest offering HALF PAST DEAD was released on DVD in NZ simultaneously with THE FOREIGNER. I decided against renting both at once in case I came down with a severe case of ""Seagal Stupidity Syndrome"" due to overexposure to his movies, thus rendering me a lifeless vegetable (In which case my friends would probably have me embalmed in French dressing, just to be cheeky.)Actually HALF PAST DEAD ain't half bad. The plot is a mix of DIE HARD, THE ROCK and CON AIR. A not terribly original combo from Writer/ Director Don Michael Paul, but this isn't CITIZEN KANE we're talking about here. Paul has loaded the movie with so many explosive stunts that viewers are unlikely to care.Seagal also co-produced with Andrew Stevens, the man responsible for the humdrum NIGHT EYES franchise.Steve plays FBI Agent Sascha Petrosevitch; who coincidentally also used to work for the CIA, KGB, and U.S Marshalls. Busy boy.The opening is pretty silly: Petrosevich is wounded in the line of fire and flatlines, but comes back cuz he's Steven Seagal baby!; hence the movie's title HALF PAST DEAD. (Shouldn't this be HARD TO KILL 2?).Immediately, the movie flashes forward 8 months later to Sasha's latest assignment: To go undercover in the newly re-opened Alcatraz prison (Cleverly renamed ""New Alcatraz"") to infiltrate gangs operating within the compound's impenetrable walls. Well, almost impenetrable. The warden makes the silly mistake of announcing to the inmates: ""There's only one way off The Rock, and that key is under my pillow"". How helpful.Convieniently there also just happens to be $200 million worth of gold hidden in the facilities by a prisoner who is condemned to die in the electric chair within the next few hours.And as if this isn't bad enough the prison is taken hostage by a band of commandos turned terrorists led by ""49er One"" (Morris Chestnut) &  ""49er Six"" (played by the incredibly sultry Nia Peeples) who want the gold- and they mean business when they strap the visiting Supreme Court Justice into the electric chair in which she's sent so many men to their deaths. Naturally only Steve, with help of convict Nick  (Played by rapper Ja Rule) can save the Judge and the prisoners.Fortunately, HALF PAST DEAD is an action movie which seems to realize its own limitations, so it delivers what viewers want: Loads of explosive, high-octane stunts and mindless destruction. The personal highlight for me is the fight scene between Peeples and Ja Rule where Peeples says ""Let's put the guns down and settle this like... men"" before giving him a Matrix-style martial arts butt-kicking. My only compaint is the stupid prison phone coversation which plays during the end credits. What's the point? That aside, HALF PAST DEAD is pure popcorn cinema that delivers the goods. This is a good no-brainer to watch with a group of friends.

Law,"[3, 4]","First off, I know you've probably heard a lot of bad reviews for this movie claiming that it's nothing new and all that and it isn't anything new but is that really that bad? It's something we haven't seen in awhile. Folks, this is an 80's action movie. This is what THE TRANSPORTER and BALLISTIC; ECKS VS. SEVER should have been but they weren't anywhere even close.I must say that HALF PAST DEAD pleasantly surprised me. It's a quick paced, lighthearted action movie with a little bit of DIE HARD, a little bit of CON AIR and a little bit of THE ROCK and that's okay. It works!!! It's an hour and forty-five minutes of straight action and it's leagues better than EXIT WOUNDS, which admittedly doesn't take much.All in all though it's the supporting cast and not Seagal that make things work.  Morris Chestnut (who also starred with Seagal in UNDER SIEGE 2: DARK TERRITORY) brings some style and some coolness to the lead villain. Nia Peeples is just plain gorgeous as the gun-toting, ass kicking martial arts babe who is second-in-command on the bad guy's side. Hell, Peeples' part is the part Lucy Liu should have taken instead of the wretched trash that was ECKS VS. SEVER.  Peeples has a really cool fight sequence with Ja Rule. This movie's worth checking out if only for that scene alone.But the most memorable performance goes to Tony Plana who plays the warden, El Fuego. He literally chews through the film's scenery with his rugged tough guy looks. Trust me, he's a pretty cool supporting character.Now, can you take this movie seriously...No way! But it is loads of fun. If you're an action fan then this movie should satisfy!It's just too bad we didn't have Jason Statham (THE TRANSPORTER) as the lead in this instead of Seagal then this really would have rocked. Check it out though, you won't be disappointed.C+",3,The best action movie in a long time...SERIOUSLY!!!,1037750400,"11 20, 2002",2002,1827,"['First', 'know', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'lot', 'bad', 'reviews', 'movie', 'claiming', 'nothing', 'new', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'really', 'bad', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'Folks', '80', 'action', 'movie', 'what', 'THE', 'TRANSPORTER', 'BALLISTIC', 'ECKS', 'VS', 'SEVER', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'were', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'even', 'close.I', 'must', 'say', 'HALF', 'PAST', 'DEAD', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'quick', 'paced', 'lighthearted', 'action', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'little', 'bit', 'CON', 'AIR', 'little', 'bit', 'THE', 'ROCK', 'okay', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'straight', 'action', 'leagues', 'better', 'EXIT', 'WOUNDS', 'admittedly', ""n't"", 'take', 'much.All', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'Seagal', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Seagal', 'UNDER', 'SIEGE', '2', 'DARK', 'TERRITORY', 'style', 'coolness', 'lead', 'villain', 'Nia', 'Peeples', 'just', 'plain', 'gorgeous', 'gun-toting', 'ass', 'kicking', 'martial', 'arts', 'babe', 'who', 'second-in-command', 'bad', 'guy', 'side', 'Hell', 'Peeples', 'part', 'part', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'instead', 'wretched', 'trash', 'was', 'ECKS', 'VS', 'SEVER', 'Peeples', 'really', 'cool', 'fight', 'sequence', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'movie', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'only', 'scene', 'alone.But', 'most', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Tony', 'Plana', 'who', 'warden', 'El', 'Fuego', 'literally', 'film', 'scenery', 'rugged', 'tough', 'guy', 'Trust', 'pretty', 'cool', 'supporting', 'character.Now', 'can', 'take', 'movie', 'seriously', 'way', 'loads', 'fun', ""'re"", 'action', 'fan', 'then', 'movie', 'should', 'satisfy', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'THE', 'TRANSPORTER', 'lead', 'instead', 'Seagal', 'then', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'rocked', 'Check', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.C+']",N/A
733760,A364W6U6YL219D,B0000844MD,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[1, 3]","Half Past Dead (2002) After the success of Exit Wounds, Steven Seagal surrounded himself with more hip hop heroes for this, one of his last Big Screen Action Flicks. Seagal is Sascha Petrosevitch, a criminal recruited by Nick (Ja Rule) to work for big time mastermind Sonny (Richard Bremmer). But Sascha and Nick are soon caught and sent to a remodeled and renovated Alcatraz, which has a really cool new execution chamber with the choice of five different ways to die. A criminal named Lester (Bruce Weitz) is scheduled to be the first to go in the new death room, but not before several terrorist/criminals led by Donnie (Morris Chestnut) pop up looking for the location of some gold Lester stole and hid. It's then that Sascha reveals the truth--that he is an undercover FBI agent and it's up to him and his new pal Nick to stop the bad guys. From here this is standard Seagal territory, with lots of bone snapping fights and action aplenty. Seagal is chunking back up though, so the editing team is called on to assist him in regaining his speed of old, but the other, younger cast members acquit themselves pretty well in the fightin' and blowin' stuff up arenas. Writer/director Don Michael Paul used to be an actor, with lots of tv series and tv movies under his belt. He's been away from the lens side of the camera for a while, writing and directing several episodes of a varied assortment of tv shows, and he also wrote the script for Harley Davidson and The Marlboro Man, that rather strange Don Johnson/Mickey Rourke movie from 1991. He does a workmanlike job with both of his assignments here, not breaking much new ground, but providing the required elements in the required doses at the required intervals. While this is a somewhat lesser light in the Seagal Ouevre, it has enough to recommend it to hardcore fans, including the cool casting of former Avengers star Linda Thorson as a judge, and the somewhat goofy casting of Don Michael Paul's former producer boss Stephen J. Cannell as the head of the Bureau of Prisons (?) If you're looking for some simple action on a medium to small scale, this flick will serve your purpose. All others need not apply.

Its a great film to have on for some background noise.  Between tons of guns and explosions and the hip-hop soundtrack, its an audio-filled time.  Fortunately, there is so little to this film, I was able to know exactly what was going on when I wasn't even completely watching.  All I can say is, here's another Seagal film, where Seagal is just put to waste.Mr. Seagal had his time, and that was long before this movie was released.  Looking tired and worn out, he surely doesn't provide the convincing Akido hero we all love, but he's earned his name, and no matter how badly he performs on screen, movies will continue to be pumped out of production and watched by many, just as in the case of Half Past Dead.  The plot is simple and uninteresting, I won't even explain.  This movie is all about tons and tons of action, nothing more.  Character development is unintersting too, and while there was some possibilities for some great things to unfold between people, I guess the creators just didn't feel like doing anything special.It all comes down to the guns and fights.  There are several fight scenes, but it seems that guns are the weapons of choice in this film, not fists.  Of the couple of fight scenes there were, they looking tiring and uninspiring.  Some either end too quickly, and some you just want to end before they look any more ridiculous.  Its obvious the creators were trying, but it just didn't work in the end.Like I said, great movie for some background noise...yes its fun to listen to, but I guess that's really what cds are for.

733768,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0000844MD,Jeffrey Leach,"[5, 9]","In the late 1980s and early 1990's, it looked as though Steven Seagal would join the ranks of Hollywood's top action stars. You would hear his name in the same sentence with Arnie and Stallone, no small feat indeed. And to a large degree, Seagal's films deserved the comparison. ""Under Siege"" was a winner, as were ""Hard to Kill"" and ""Above the Law."" The actor's greatest appeal isn't hard to fathom; Seagal embraced a brutal form of martial arts that, at least onscreen, allowed him to slap down thugs, break bones, and wreak massive havoc without batting an eye. Literally, Seagal would stand in place and put down one goon after the other with an ease that looked not only realistic but also extremely painful. I still enjoy watching that pool room scene where Seagal's character used cues, billiard balls, and whatever else he could lay his hands on to put out the trash. Alas, how the mighty have fallen. The early 1990s may as well be ancient history as far as Steven Seagal is concerned. Although he's still capable of making a few entertaining films, like his comeback picture ""Exit Wounds,"" far too often we're seeing movies like ""The Foreigner"" and ""Half Past Dead"".Oh, the horror that is ""Half Past Dead""! After watching this car wreck, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Seagal plays (yeah right) Sasha Petrosevich, an undercover FBI agent trying to bring down the chap that killed his wife. In the process of trying to take this guy down, Sasha and Nick Frazier (Ja Rule) end up in a newly reopened Alcatraz. Why is Seagal in prison? Because Nick works for the aforementioned crime boss, thinks Seagal is still a criminal, and has information that our hero needs to break the case. Got that? Good, cuz it's the last time any of it matters BECAUSE now that Seagal is in prison, a new caper unfolds that he must deal with. An inmate scheduled for execution knows the whereabouts of hundreds of millions of dollars in gold. Before he meets his maker, an outfit of black clad thugs led by Donny Johnson (Morris Chestnut) and his right hand gal, known as 49er Six (Nia Peeples), break into the prison and take everyone hostage. Oh, and they kill a bunch of people too. AND they take a Supreme Court justice, Jane McPherson (Linda Thorson), hostage as well. Warden El Fuego (Tony Plana), Special Agent Ellen Williams (Claudia Christian), and even Stephen J. Cannell all show up as well.Obviously, it's up to the portly Seagal to swoop in and save the day. As the entire law enforcement community of the United States stands around outside the prison drinking coffee, our hero must overcome numerous obstacles to win the day, including but not limited to: turning the prison population into his own personal army, securing the weapons in the penitentiary's armory (which contains everything except nuclear warheads), finding out where that gold is, saving the hostages, repairing his relationship with Nick Frazier, and killing the requisite number of baddies. Whew! That's a tall order! But then again, we're talking about Seagal. He can do anything. And he does even when doing so defies the very laws of physics. Like the time he and Nick Frazier sit in a helicopter that has half crashed through glass panes in the ceiling of the prison and use the choppers arsenal to mow down the bad guys. Why are there glass panes in the ceiling of a newly rebuilt Alcatraz? How can they use one of the guns on the chopper to successfully shoot down an incoming rocket launched from about ten feet away? Who cares man, it's Seagal!""Half Past Dead"" is half past brain dead. This is one sorry film, surpassed in true hideousness only by subsequent Steven Seagal efforts...you know, the ones he's been shooting in Eastern Europe the last couple of years. I mean, I knew I was in trouble when I witnessed Steven Seagal ambling into prison wearing a doo rag and spouting ebonics. That's just not right on so many levels. Then there's the choreography for the fight scenes, or rather the lack of choreography. Some of it works, I should say, but most of the scenes are so woodenly handled that it's obvious we're seeing stunt doubles doing the work that Lord Steven could have easily handled ten years ago. And speaking of Seagal (as, one should say, we must always do), he's certainly been hitting the puddin' pops hard in the last couple of years. Watching him toddle around ""fighting"" is like watching Orson Welles starring in ""Enter the Dragon"". It ain't happening anymore. He's far past his prime. Even his ponytail needs Lipitor at this point. But really, the most disappointing part of the movie is seeing Stephen Cannell here. That hurts in ways I can't really talk about. He should know better.Supplements, and there are supplements, on the DVD include a commentary track from director and writer Don Michael Paul (who can now be seen scooping French fries at a Wendy's in Toledo, Ohio), a few deleted scenes that add absolutely nothing to the atrocity we've just witnessed, a making of featurette that's really sad, and a bunch of trailers for other films that are far better than this one (the trailers are ""Half Past Dead,"" ""XXX,"" ""National Security,"" and ""I Spy""). By the way, the movie gets its title from the fact that Seagal's character literally dies in the film, but is revived so he can save the day. Whatever. We'd all have been better off if the doctors had just let Sasha Petrosevich die on the operating table. Heck, that would've shaved off eighty minutes of the pure hell that is otherwise known as my viewing experience!",1,Half past brain dead,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,5541,"['late', '1980s', 'early',

But that doesn't help you figure out whether or not to put this DVD in your shopping cart . . .If you thought you missed this film at the theatre, you didn't.  If you thought Mr. Seagal was ""back"" because ""Exit Wounds"" was a good action flick, well - he's not.The story is choppy . . . and I say that knowing that the story is not the priority of an action film.  I mean you will find yourself once or twice going ""what the hell?""  And if the story (dare I say ""plot"") that doesn't need to be the real highlight in a Steven Seagal-action film is so out of sorts that you actually find yourself stopping to ponder what it going on, you know two things have happened - (1) there is no story, there is no stream of consciousness that you can follow to even figure why or what reason there is for anything to be coming together, because it is not and (2) there is NOT enough action.There is not enough Seagal.  If you want to run the risk and pick up the DVD because you are a die hard Seagal fan, he looks horrible, tired and puffy in it, and he's phoning it in ala Tommy Lee Jones in ""Batman Forever.""  Remember how it seemed Mr. Jones knew Jim Carrey would steal the show, so he was just along for the ride?  It seems like Mr. Seagal is just along for the ride in this film as well.  I am hard-pressed to recall any major action scenes around him.By the way . . .if you were a fan of ""Fame"" and want to see what happened to Nia Pepples, pick it up.  I was surprised to see her in the flick, and she was good.  Morris Chestnut was good, as well.WARNING:But here's a SPOILER if you dare to read on . . .  you know how in most of these types of films, Steven Seagal will have some final one-on-one with the big bad and hand him back his a$$?

Stelly,"[2, 4]","I first &quot;discovered&quot; Steven Seagal when he made &quot;Above the Law.&quot; HEre was this tall, skinny white boy who obviously knew something about the martial arts -- no charlatan he! Iloved the moral of corrupt government and his lone ranger approach to exposing that corruption. Then came &quot;hard to Kill&quot; and again,we dealt with crooked politicians and Seagal's one man gang approach to exposing them. &quot;Marked for Death&quot; interjected race and Seagal had a hard time justifying how he could destroy an entire Jamaican drug posse on their own turf. But even in that, he showed mastery of his craft and protected suburbia from the influx of Rastafarian ne'er-do-wells. In &quot;out for justice&quot; he avenged the death of his partner and played the role of a cop out for vengeance: &quot;Anybody here know why somebody would wanna kill Bobby Lupo?&quot; His Italian accent left a lot to be desired, but his martial arts skills were on display as he dissected an entire pool hall and at movie's end, some of William Thompson's front teeth.But from there we saw changes. He went big time with Under Siege and Under Siege: Dark Territory,&quot; but then took a jive role in &quot;Executive Decision.&quot; From there it was all downhill.His major problem was pushaways. It was clear that he found it difficult to push himself away from the table! He got fatter and fatter and his martial arts degenerated from full camera angles to clips and stand-ins. He went on a tear of movies teaming up with even goonier rap stars: DMX and then this kid Ja-Rule. As he descended down the hill into the valley of mediocrity, no movie better evidences this slide than &quot;half past dead.&quot;Somehow, he and Ja-Rule organize a prison riot and break. I don't want to give what little plot there is away, but in my view, Nia Peeples steals the show. Not only does she look great in her all black leather gear, but her martial arts skills are real and make Seagal look like a relative novice. Seagal is also upstaged by almost everyone else in the movie, and his fight scenes are laughable. The Steven Seagal who did &quot;Above the Law&quot; and &quot;Out for Justice&quot; has disappeared with flicks like &quot;The Foreigner,&quot;&quot;The Patriot,&quot; and a slew of others, that only seem interested in giving him star billing to lure poor suckers into renting videos (most of is movies, thank God, are going straight to video, bypassing movie theaters).This movie is embarrassingly bad for everyone except for hip-hop fans, who will enjoy Ja-Rule's role as a prisoner (yeah, like he'd make it without being some guy's boy toy). Don't waste your time, folks - he's not the same Steven Seagal. Perhaps his talents would best be put to use if he made a movie called, &quot;Above the Kitchen Table,&quot; or how about, &quot;Out for Grub&quot;? Maybe one titled, &quot;Under Siege: Curdled Gravy&quot; or &quot;Marked For a Diet.&quot;",2,Half Past Dead is an Understatement!,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,2952,"['first', 'quot', 'discovered', 'quot', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'when', 'made', 'quot', 'Law.', 'quot', 'HEre', 'was', 'tall', 'skinny', 'white', 'boy', 'who', 'obviously', 'knew', 'something', 'martial', 'arts', 'charlatan', 'Iloved', 'moral', 'corrupt', 'government', 'lone', 'ranger', 'approach', 'exposing', 'corruption', 'Then', 'came', 'quot', 'hard', 'Kill', 'quot', 'again', 'dealt', 'crooked', 'politicians', 'Seagal', 'one', 'man', 'gang', 'approach', 'exposing', 'quot', 'Marked', 'Death', 'quot', 'interjected', 'race', 'Seagal', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'justifying', 'how', 'could', 'destroy', 'entire', 'Jamaican', 'drug', 'posse', 'own', 'turf', 'even', 'showed', 'mastery', 'craft', 'protected', 'suburbia', 'influx', 'Rastafarian', ""ne'er-do-wells"", 'quot', 'out', 'justice', 'quot', 'avenged', 'death', 'partner', 'played', 'role', 'cop', 'out', 'vengeance', 'quot', 'Anybody', 'here', 'know', 'why', 'somebody', 'would', 'wan', 'na', 'kill', 'Bobby', 'Lupo', 'quot', 'Italian', 'accent', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'were', 'display', 'dissected', 'entire', 'pool', 'hall', 'movie', 'end', 'William', 'Thompson', 'front', 'teeth.But', 'saw', 'changes', 'went', 'big', 'time', 'Siege', 'Siege', 'Dark', 'Territory', 'quot', 'then', 'took', 'jive', 'role', 'quot', 'Executive', 'Decision.', 'quot', 'was', 'downhill.His', 'major', 'problem', 'was', 'pushaways', 'was', 'clear', 'found', 'difficult', 'push', 'away', 'table', 'got', 'fatter', 'fatter', 'martial', 'arts', 'degenerated', 'full', 'camera', 'angles', 'clips', 'stand-ins', 'went', 'tear', 'movies', 'teaming', 'up', 'even', 'goonier', 'rap', 'stars', 'DMX', 'then', 'kid', 'Ja-Rule', 'descended', 'down', 'hill', 'valley', 'mediocrity', 'movie', 'better', 'slide', 'quot', 'half', 'dead.', 'quot', 'Somehow', 'Ja-Rule', 'organize', 'prison', 'riot', 'break', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'what', 'little', 'plot', 'away', 'view', 'Nia', 'Peeples', 'show', 'Not', 'only', 'look', 'great', 'black', 'leather', 'gear', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'are', 'real', 'make', 'Seagal', 'look', 'relative', 'novice', 'Seagal', 'also', 'upstaged', 'almost', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'laughable', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'who', 'did', 'quot', 'Law', 'quot', 'quot', 'Out', 'Justice', 'quot', 'disappeared', 'flicks', 'quot', 'Foreigner', 'quot', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'quot', 'slew', 'others', 'only', 'seem', 'interested', 'giving', 'star', 'billing', 'lure', 'poor', 'suckers', 'renting', 'videos', 'most', 'movies', 'thank', 'God', 'are', 'going', 'straight', 'video', 'bypassing', 'movie', 'theaters', '.This', 'movie', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'everyone', 'hip-hop', 'fans', 'who', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Ja-Rule', 'role', 'prisoner', 'yeah', ""'d"", 'make', 'being', 'guy', 'boy', 'toy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'folks', 'not', 'same', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Perhaps', 'talents', 'would', 'best', 'be', 'put', 'use', 'made', 'movie', 'called', 'quot', 'Kitchen', 'Table', 'quot', 'how', 'about', 'quot', 'Out', 'Grub', 'quot', 'Maybe', 'one', 'titled', 'quot', 'Siege', 'Curdled', 'Gravy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Marked', 'Diet.', 'quot']",N/A

733779,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B0000844MD,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","I'll say it right away: I like ""Half Past Dead"" mainly because it has Steven Seagal in it. Indeed, this tends to make more casual viewers like a film less, but as someone raised on the man's poorer DTV outings, I found HPD a surprisingly exhilarating departure from the repetitive wrist-snapping, stale shootouts, and nonsensical storylines of the majority of the aikido master's lesser films. Less passionate or non-fans of Seagal will almost certainly catch onto the film's faults, but devotees shouldn't be disillusioned: our hero's last theatrical outing is worth watching.The plot: car thief Sasha Petrosevich (Seagal) and his friend and partner Nick (Ja Rule,The Fast and the Furious) are busted by the FBI and sent to the newly-opened Alcatraz. Before long, the in-prison execution of an infamous gold thief (Bruce Weitz,Hill Street Blues) is interrupted by terrorists eager to find his hidden treasure (headed byMorris ChestnutandNia Peebles). Sasha must now rally the prisoners to the side of justice and use his uncanny abilities to foil the plot.Style- and story-wise, ""Half Past Dead"" is a combination of Seagal'sExit Woundsand Sean Connery'sThe Rock, but there's really no comparison when it comes to dramatic strength. Seagal is probably the first man to play a Russian without an accent, and nobody in the film acts with any kind of memorable finesse. Ja Rule's weasily performance in particular is best left forgotten. In addition, whoever was in charge of the editing and camerawork deserves a swat on the nose: endless slow-motion is topped by hit-and-miss cinematography that develops a trend of showing guns being pointed and fired but not who was shot. Add a few silly scenes - like Seagal ""accidentally"" hurling Ja Rule out of his car as a joke without reprimand - and it's easy to see why this film didn't do too well at the box office.However, once we consider that this is a Steven Seagal film, we begin to appreciate it for its good points, all of which come back the fact that it's a return to action for our hero. The gunfights are numerous and diverse - the final shootout in the cell block is pure action fantasy - and the hand-to-hand fights are similarly nice, with nifty choreography by Xin Xin Xiong (Seven Swords) proving that Seagal still had the moves at the time he went straight-to-video. Though the latter have a knack for ending disappointingly, the encounters are fast-paced and range from an unexpected Nia Peebles/Ja Rule confrontation to an acrobatic Seagal/Chestnut tussle on 15-foot hanging chains. If that's not enough, then judge on the fact that HPD is built entirely upon fun: whereas flicks likeThe Foreignerwould focus excruciatingly on stories that no one understood, HPD is a straightforward action vehicle that makes no secret of being silly but boasts some definite adrenaline. Essentially, it's the kind of movie that makes hotdogs and popcorn taste even better.Diehard Seagal fans will not want to be without this one. Others viewers will be a bit harder to sell on this premise, but even in their case, you could definitely find worse if you're looking for a way to spend the evening in front of the television.",3,Not Half Past Bad,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,3171,"[""'ll"", 'say', 'right', 'away', 'like', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', 'mainly', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Indeed', 'make', 'more', 'casual', 'viewers', 'film', 'less', 'someone', 'raised', 'man', 'poorer', 'DTV', 'outings', 'found', 'HPD', 'surprisingly', 'exhilarating', 'departure', 'repetitive', 'wrist-snapping', 'stale', 'shootouts', 'nonsensical', 'storylines', 'majority', 'aikido', 'master', 'lesser', 'films', 'Less', 'passionate', 'non-fans', 'Seagal', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'catch', 'film', 'faults', 'devotees', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'disillusioned', 'hero', 'last', 'theatrical', 'outing', 'watching.The', 'plot', 'car', 'thief', 'Sasha', 'Petrosevich', 'Seagal', 'friend', 'partner', 'Nick', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'are', 'busted', 'FBI', 'sent', 'newly-opened', 'Alcatraz', 'long', 'in-prison', 'execution', 'infamous', 'gold', 'thief', 'Bruce', 'Weitz', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'interrupted', 'terrorists', 'eager', 'find', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'headed', 'byMorris', 'ChestnutandNia', 'Peebles', 'Sasha', 'must', 'now', 'rally', 'prisoners', 'side', 'justice', 'use', 'uncanny', 'abilities', 'foil', 'plot.Style-', 'story-wise', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', 'combination', ""Seagal'sExit"", 'Woundsand', 'Sean', ""Connery'sThe"", 'Rock', 'really', 'comparison', 'when', 'dramatic', 'strength', 'Seagal', 'probably', 'first', 'man', 'play', 'Russian', 'accent', 'nobody', 'film', 'acts', 'kind', 'memorable', 'finesse', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'weasily', 'performance', 'particular', 'best', 'left', 'forgotten', 'addition', 'was', 'charge', 'editing', 'camerawork', 'swat', 'nose', 'endless', 'slow-motion', 'topped', 'hit-and-miss', 'cinematography', 'trend', 'showing', 'guns', 'being', 'pointed', 'fired', 'not', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'Add', 'few', 'silly', 'scenes', 'Seagal', 'accidentally', 'hurling', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'car', 'joke', 'reprimand', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'well', 'box', 'office.However', 'once', 'consider', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'film', 'begin', 'appreciate', 'good', 'points', 'come', 'back', 'fact', 'return', 'action', 'hero', 'gunfights', 'are', 'numerous', 'diverse', 'final', 'shootout', 'cell', 'block', 'pure', 'action', 'fantasy', 'hand-to-hand', 'fights', 'are', 'similarly', 'nice', 'nifty', 'choreography', 'Xin', 'Xin', 'Xiong', 'Seven', 'Swords', 'proving', 'Seagal', 'still', 'had', 'moves', 'time', 'went', 'straight-to-video', 'latter', 'have', 'knack', 'ending', 'disappointingly', 'encounters', 'are', 'fast-paced', 'range', 'unexpected', 'Nia', 'Peebles/Ja', 'Rule', 'confrontation', 'acrobatic', 'Seagal/Chestnut', 'tussle', '15-foot', 'hanging', 'chains', 'not', 'enough', 'then', 'judge', 'fact', 'HPD', 'built', 'entirely', 'fun', 'whereas', 'flicks', 'likeThe', 'Foreignerwould', 'focus', 'excruciatingly', 'stories', 'one', 'understood', 'HPD', 'straightforward', 'action', 'vehicle', 'secret', 'being', 'silly', 'definite', 'adrenaline', 'Essentially', 'kind', 'movie', 'hotdogs', 'popcorn', 'taste', 'even', 'better.Diehard', 'Seagal', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'one', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'harder', 'sell', 'premise', 'even', 'case', 'could', 'definitely', 'find', 'worse', ""'re"", 'looking', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'front', 'television']",N/A

There were a couple times when I thought the movie was going to end up being good, but a couple goods don't beat fifty lames.Here's the plot: Ja Rule and Steven Segal are partners in crime until they're unexpectedly arrested and thrown into the New Alcatraz prison. Coincidentally, an inmate there knows where 200 million dollars worth of gold is, but he's on death row, and he plans to take the secret with him to the grave. Some dirty government bad guys think differently though, and they decide to break into the prison and coerce the dead man walking into telling them where the gold is. The bad guys start killing people, so Steven Segal, Ja Rule, and the inmates get out of their cells, get a bunch of guns, and save the day, all with Ja Rule's music pumping in the background.I guess I just wasn't very convinced.

Yes he has always been a terrible actor and not very many people have liked him, but action movies is what he does, like Arnold. You dont have to act well in actions, and yes they do come off as being quite cheesy and unrealistic, but it doesn't fail to entertain, even for those who arent that into actions, like me.  Alot of parts were cheesy in half past dead, like when the music blasted as they walked with guns, as if it's cool to be a homicidal maniac who kills cops for no reason. But what do you expect. It's sensless garbage, but i was still entertained. Ja Rule and Korrupt werent oscar worthy or anything, but still added a little something like humor, and that thug vybe, especially for ja rule and korrupt fans, who only went to see the movie because they were in it.

Then producer Joel Silver appeared on the scene and resurrected the aging aikido champ for Exit Wounds in 2001.So what do you do if you're Seagal?You pack on more pounds and make Half Past Dead, a DOA film that was part of a two-picture deal that included The Foreigner.  I mean, no one expects a Seagal film to be Godard, folks.  Seagal appeals as a tough guy action icon who smacks bad guys around and looks silly with his ponytail, soft-voice delivery of bad lines, and shameless perpetuation of a mysterious past / Buddhist mystique.  Unfortunately, Half Past Dead offends in all departments.For one, it's PG-13, a major problem.  If you're going to have a Seagal film with a lot of shooting, people need to die violently.  Why else are you watching these movies?!  Then, there's an attempt to tell a story that is too complicated for its own good.  A deep undercover cop, a tricky criminal, a prison takeover, an inmate with a secret, a lot of shooting, a lot of loud rap music (which, even worse, has the swear words washed out!)  I could talk about the whole story and the plot, but it wouldn't matter. The film is riddled with very tired action movie clich&eacute;s.  Bad guys don black dusters that flap in the wind; people hold two guns and shoot in slow motion, etc etc.  It's a bore to watch John Woo and countless other followers imitated (badly) yet again all in the service of a ... story.Seagal is getting older, but he only stacks the deck against himself as he continues to balloon up.  It's obvious that he can't do any stunts.  His fight scenes are awful, period.  And since he could never act, you have to wonder where his career is headed.  Half Past Dead did so poorly that The Foreigner, which was supposed to get a theatrical release depending on the success of the first film, was shot right out of the straight to DVD cannon.  Ja Rule is unexceptional as a gangster, and his attempts to teach Seagal (who is deep undercover with the name Sasha) how to say 'Aight' (for 'all right') make the film even more embarrassing.The funny thing is, The Foreigner, which went straight to DVD because of Half Past Dead's failure at the box office, is a better movie.  It's bad, sure, but at least it's R-rated and has enough stupid violence and exotic locales to make it pass for some kind of entertainment.

But Seagal couldn't resist in making another crappy film, so he gave us this ""Half Past Dead""...More like Half Past 300 Pounds ; Seagal also couldn't resist from eating more quarter pounders, I bet he created his own cheeseburger during the hiatus he had from Exit wounds to Half Past Dead.It must have been called ""Seagal's gain weight in 10 days cheeseburger"". Seriously, I don't understand how someone can gain weight from one movie to another. If you were to put Exit Wounds & Half Past Dead together side by side you will notice a huge difference in weight.As for the movie itself its ludicrous at most; the plot is so laughable that I have no idea how anyone could have green light this project, First of all this is a rip-off ""The Rock"". the whole movie is about some dudes that decide to brake in to a newly reopened Alcatraz, inside they will find an inmate that has the location of a lot of money in gold brick. The inmates decide to fight back against the criminals that are breaking in..Ironic isn't? Funny thing is if you watch the trailer for the movie it seems somewhat interesting, the idea of breaking into a jailhouse is a bit original and neat, but the way it was executed here was very weak. Even though this movie is billed as a ""Seagal"" movie, it really isn't. Ja-Rule, Morris Chestnut and even Kurupt have more screen time than Seagal. And the most annoying thing is the doubles; Seagal has doubles for all of his fights, and when he does fight is just the camera closing in on his overweight face doing patty cake with his hands.Conclusion, seeing Seagal trying to be Gansta, wearing Durags and wearing big clothes to look thinner wont make a movie better, as a matter of fact it will make it worse. And why make a PG-13 Seagal movie, all of them have been rated R; its like making Die Hard or Alien Pg-13 (Which they did) The only good thing about this movie is the intro music from Ja-Rule.

733788,ABE14SVILZLNY,B0000844MD,"SID ""Punk""","[11, 18]","Half Past DeadJust two months ago, I wrote about how depressingly 80s action film retro I found `Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever.' Now comes another slice of the same bitter pie, `Half Past Dead.'Sascha (Steven Segal) and Nick (rapper Ja Rule) are two criminal buddies out to make a huge score with some stolen goods. When an FBI agent (Claudia Christian) interrupts the deal, the duo is sent to the new, improved Alcatraz to serve their prison sentences. While Sascha and Nick are finding their bearings, a team of thieves, lead by criminal mastermind Donny (Morris Chestnut, `Like Mike`), have broken into the prison to retrieve information from a death row inmate about 200 million dollars worth of stolen gold bars. With the FBI held at bay as Donny and his crew raise hell in the prison, it's up to Sascha and Nick to save the day.Television actor Don Michael Paul (`Renegade,' `Models, Inc.') makes his directorial debut with `Half Past Dead,' and somebody's been studying the Michael Bay school of action. `Dead' isn't anything new. It's chaotically photographed and sloppily performed like countless other action vehicles, scored with any rap or nu-metal track the production could get its hands on, and actually tries to make Steven Seagal into a sensitive hero, allowing the stilted actor some scenes of smiling, and even comedy, to open up his range. It's like watching Leatherface on `Whose Line Is It Anyways?' It just doesn't quite work or make sense.Even though the film is decidedly formulaic, you can only fight that for so long before you have to make due with what you've got. And `Half Past Dead' ain't half bad, if you can stomach the lack of creativity, and the employment of not one, but two rappers in the film (Kurupt has a small role). A small time rip-off of `The Rock,' `Die Hard,' and any other gun fetishizing, machismo actioner you can think of from the late 80s to the mid 90s, `Dead' attempts to be oceans of fun, but Paul shamelessly guides his film through the motions, without any idea that what he is committing to film here is beyond played out.It's not that he's wasting a great leading cast in the process. Though notorious for letting the camera sell his fight scenes for him, it seems Steven Seagal went one better and only showed up for his close-ups here in `Dead.' The once mighty, now just absurd action star doesn't help Paul out with his monotonous line readings and refusal to perform a single one of his own stunts. Same goes for baddie Morris Chestnut, whose matches Seagal scene for scene with his own brand of lifeless, embarrassing acting (this is the second film the actors have made together). And the less said about Ja Rule, the better. Can we even call what he does acting?Thankfully, Paul has cast his supporting players with a little more flair, and maybe even helped out some old friends in the process. Television vets Bruce Weitz (`Hill Street Blues') and Tony Plana turn in strong work as a death row inmate and an Alcatraz warden, respectively. Claudia Christian (`Babylon 5') brings a rough butchness to her FBI role, conjuring up more testosterone than any of the rappers. Even Stephan J. Cannell, old-school action producer of `The A-Team' and `Hunter,' shows up in a small role. And Nia Peeples, of all people, the eternally chipper host of the failed 90s dance show `The Party Machine' and a vet of countless TV movies, takes on the role of Donny's number one hit woman. Peeples steals the movie away from everyone, mostly because it appears she's the only one to show up for her stunt work. With an entire movie you can set your watch to, Paul's little casting surprises outside of Seagal keeps this desperate little film interesting.",3,H@/F p@$T  De@d,1038441600,"11 28, 2002",2002,3700,"['Half', 'Past', 'DeadJust', 'two', 'months', 'wrote', 'how', 'depressingly', '80s', 'action', 'film', 'retro', 'found', 'Ballistic', 'Ecks', 'Vs', 'Sever', 'Now', 'slice', 'same', 'bitter', 'pie', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'Nick', 'rapper', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'are', 'two', 'criminal', 'buddies', 'make', 'huge', 'score', 'stolen', 'goods', 'When', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Claudia', 'Christian', 'deal', 'duo', 'sent', 'new', 'improved', 'Alcatraz', 'serve', 'prison', 'sentences', 'Sascha', 'Nick', 'are', 'finding', 'bearings', 'team', 'thieves', 'lead', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'Donny', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Mike', 'have', 'broken', 'prison', 'retrieve', 'information', 'death', 'row', 'inmate', '200', 'million', 'dollars', 'worth', 'stolen', 'gold', 'bars', 'FBI', 'held', 'bay', 'Donny', 'crew', 'raise', 'hell', 'prison', 'up', 'Sascha', 'Nick', 'save', 'day.Television', 'actor', 'Don', 'Michael', 'Paul', 'Renegade', 'Models', 'Inc.', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', 'somebody', 'been', 'studying', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'school', 'action', 'Dead', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'chaotically', 'photographed', 'sloppily', 'performed', 'countless', 'other', 'action', 'vehicles', 'scored', 'rap', 'nu-metal', 'track', 'production', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'actually', 'tries', 'make', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'sensitive', 'hero', 'allowing', 'stilted', 'actor', 'scenes', 'smiling', 'even', 'comedy', 'open', 'up', 'range', 'watching', 'Leatherface', 'Whose', 'Line', 'Anyways', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'make', 'sense.Even', 'film', 'decidedly', 'formulaic', 'can', 'only', 'fight', 'so', 'long', 'have', 'make', 'due', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', 'ai', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'can', 'stomach', 'lack', 'creativity', 'employment', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'rappers', 'film', 'Kurupt', 'small', 'role', 'small', 'time', 'rip-off', 'Rock', 'Die', 'Hard', 'other', 'gun', 'fetishizing', 'machismo', 'can', 'think', 'late', '80s', 'mid', '90s', 'Dead', 'attempts', 'be', 'oceans', 'fun', 'Paul', 'shamelessly', 'film', 'motions', 'idea', 'what', 'committing', 'film', 'here', 'played', 'out.It', 'not', 'wasting', 'great', 'leading', 'cast', 'process', 'notorious', 'letting', 'camera', 'sell', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'went', 'one', 'better', 'only', 'showed', 'up', 'close-ups', 'here', 'Dead', 'once', 'mighty', 'now', 'just', 'absurd', 'action', 'star', ""n't"", 'help', 'Paul', 'out', 'monotonous', 'line', 'readings', 'refusal', 'perform', 'single', 'one', 'own', 'stunts', 'Same', 'baddie', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'matches', 'Seagal', 'scene', 'scene', 'own', 'brand', 'lifeless', 'embarrassing', 'acting', 'second', 'film', 'actors', 'have', 'made', 'together', 'less', 'said', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'better', 'Can', 'even', 'call', 'what', 'acting', 'Thankfully', 'Paul', 'cast', 'supporting', 'players', 'little', 'more', 'flair', 'maybe', 'even', 'helped', 'out', 'old', 'friends', 'process', 'Television', 'vets', 'Bruce', 'Weitz', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'Tony', 'Plana', 'turn', 'strong', 'work', 'death', 'row', 'inmate', 'Alcatraz', 'warden', 'respectively', 'Claudia', 'Christian', 'Babylon', '5', 'rough', 'butchness', 'FBI', 'role', 'conjuring', 'up', 'more', 'testosterone', 'rappers', 'Even', 'Stephan', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'old-school', 'action', 'producer', 'A-Team', 'Hunter', 'up', 'small', 'role', 'Nia', 'Peeples', 'people', 'eternally', 'chipper', 'host', 'failed', '90s', 'dance', 'show', 'Party', 'Machine', 'vet', 'countless', 'TV', 'movies', 'role', 'Donny', 'number', 'one', 'hit', 'woman', 'Peeples', 'movie', 'away', 'everyone', 'mostly', 'only', 'one', 'show', 'up', 'stunt', 'work', 'entire', 'movie', 'can', 'set', 'watch', 'Paul', 'little', 'casting', 'surprises', 'Seagal', 'desperate', 'little', 'film', 'interesting']",N/A

I had put off watching it cause the last bunch of segal movies were absolutely horrible, but this one was actually cool. Basically, he's an FBI agent undercover, of course, and he's in prison. They call it half past dead cause in a scene in the begining of the movie where he gets shot and dies, but they are able to save him. Anyways, A dude in that prison stole like 20 million in gold 17 years before and they never found the gold and he never told anybody where it was, he's scheduled to be executed at midnight, but not if a bunch of commando like mercenaries have anything to say about it. They take over the prison, and try to get the dude to tell them where the gold is. Segal is meanwhile undercover as a prisoner, just a coicidence that he was there, he was really there to earn the trust of a different prisoner, but of course he's always in the right place at the right time. Anyways, he of course causes havoc for the mercenaries and gets some of the prisoners to help him out. There's a butt-load of shooting in it, and actually quite a bit of martial arts fighting in it. He actually didn't look fat at all either, so either they did some good camera tricks or stunt doubles, or he actually lost weight. There were also some scenes with like this kung fu maniac super chick who kicks the heck out of lots of people. He must have gained all his weight back after this movie cause the next movie after this one, Belly Of The Beast, he was fat as heck. So I would definitely reccomend you check this one out.

733795,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0000844MD,trebe,"[6, 7]","Half Past Dead, is a reasonably entertaining, comic book level, action flick.  While no masterpiece, it does have its moments, and some pleasant surprises.  Action veteran Steven Seagal heads a diverse cast, and though we don't see too much of his trademark fighting style, he delivers a solid performance, with perhaps a bit more depth of character than usual.Seagal is Sasha Petrosevitch, an undercover FBI agent, working to gain the confidence of Nick, a big time car thief, played by rapper Ja Rule.  After a confrontation with the FBI, both men are incarcerated on Alcatraz.  Bruce Weitz (Hill Street Blues) is Lester McKenna, a prisoner who has stolen and hidden 20 million in gold bullion.  On death row, he is about to be executed, when the prison is invaded by the ""49ers"", a group of criminals who want McKenna to reveal the gold's location.  Morris Chestnut is Donnie Johnson (49er One), the group's charismatic and ruthless leader.  His second in command is 49er Six, played with style and panache, by the explosive and sexy Nia Peeples.  Johnson's plans need to be adjusted, when the inmates get involved.Actor/Writer/Director Don Michael Paul provides an informative commentary that stresses and details, the trials and tribulations of bringing this low budget production to the screen.  Paul's screenplay was originally written years before, but was shelved because of similarity to Jerry Bruckheimer's film, ""The Rock"".  Rewritten to incorporate modern elements of hip-hop culture, Paul explains that his goal was to produce a fast paced film, with a stylized music video vibe.  His big screen directorial debut was filmed primarily in Berlin, shortly after the 9/11 incident.  Despite the monetary difficulties, the film delivers some decent action scenes, with enough of a plot to hold things together.  Rated PG-13, it contains massive amounts of gunfire and violence, punctuated by a rap and metal soundtrack.Ja Rule's performance is quirky, and he does a passable job in his action scenes.  Morris Chestnut makes an eloquent and intelligent villain.  Linda Thorson, as a Supreme Court Judge, and Bruce Weitz, are not bad.  Supporting characters played by Claudia Christian, Tony Plana, and the rapper Kurupt, are less developed and more one-dimensional.Nia Peeples is a suprisingly impressive bad girl.  Costumed in a tight black outfit, her look combines elements from The Crow, and The Matrix.  Peeples looks great carrying a gun, and performs most of her own fight scenes.  Her background as a dancer is put to good use, as her flashy fighting style primarily features kicking and jumping, bringing an edge to the proceedings.As for Steven Seagal, this film, like Exit Wounds, seeks to build some ties with hip-hop culture.  His character is troubled, reflective, and a bit restrained, taking the back seat at times to others.  He doesn't engage in much hand to hand, and editing makes his fight scenes flow.  Those looking for old school Steven, may be disappointed, but the reality is that time catches up with all of us.  Nonetheless, Seagal carries the film, making it an enjoyable and entertaining escape for action film aficionados.",3,Not half bad...,1072569600,"12 28, 2003",2003,3162,"['Half', 'Past', 'Dead', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'comic', 'book', 'level', 'action', 'flick', 'masterpiece', 'have', 'moments', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'Action', 'veteran', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'diverse', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'too', 'much', 'trademark', 'fighting', 'style', 'solid', 'performance', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'character', 'usual.Seagal', 'Sasha', 'Petrosevitch', 'undercover', 'FBI', 'agent', 'working', 'gain', 'confidence', 'Nick', 'big', 'time', 'car', 'thief', 'played', 'rapper', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'confrontation', 'FBI', 'men', 'are', 'incarcerated', 'Alcatraz', 'Bruce', 'Weitz', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'Lester', 'McKenna', 'prisoner', 'who', 'stolen', '20', 'million', 'gold', 'bullion', 'death', 'row', 'be', 'executed', 'when', 'prison', 'invaded', '49ers', 'group', 'criminals', 'who', 'want', 'McKenna', 'reveal', 'gold', 'location', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Donnie', 'Johnson', '49er', 'One', 'group', 'charismatic', 'ruthless', 'leader', 'second', 'command', '49er', 'Six', 'played', 'style', 'panache', 'explosive', 'sexy', 'Nia', 'Peeples', 'Johnson', 'plans', 'need', 'be', 'adjusted', 'when', 'inmates', 'get', 'involved.Actor/Writer/Director', 'Don', 'Michael', 'Paul', 'informative', 'commentary', 'details', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'bringing', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'screen', 'Paul', 'screenplay', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'years', 'was', 'shelved', 'similarity', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'film', 'Rock', 'Rewritten', 'incorporate', 'modern', 'elements', 'hip-hop', 'culture', 'Paul', 'goal', 'was', 'produce', 'fast', 'paced', 'film', 'stylized', 'music', 'video', 'vibe', 'big', 'screen', 'directorial', 'debut', 'was', 'filmed', 'primarily', 'Berlin', 'shortly', '9/11', 'incident', 'monetary', 'difficulties', 'film', 'decent', 'action', 'scenes', 'enough', 'plot', 'hold', 'things', 'together', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'massive', 'amounts', 'gunfire', 'violence', 'punctuated', 'rap', 'metal', 'soundtrack.Ja', 'Rule', 'performance', 'quirky', 'passable', 'job', 'action', 'scenes', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'eloquent', 'intelligent', 'villain', 'Linda', 'Thorson', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Judge', 'Bruce', 'Weitz', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'Supporting', 'characters', 'played', 'Claudia', 'Christian', 'Tony', 'Plana', 'rapper', 'Kurupt', 'are', 'less', 'developed', 'more', 'one-dimensional.Nia', 'Peeples', 'suprisingly', 'impressive', 'bad', 'girl', 'Costumed', 'tight', 'black', 'outfit', 'look', 'combines', 'elements', 'Crow', 'Matrix', 'Peeples', 'great', 'carrying', 'gun', 'most', 'own', 'fight', 'scenes', 'background', 'dancer', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'flashy', 'fighting', 'style', 'primarily', 'kicking', 'jumping', 'bringing', 'edge', 'proceedings.As', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'film', 'Exit', 'Wounds', 'build', 'ties', 'hip-hop', 'culture', 'character', 'troubled', 'reflective', 'bit', 'restrained', 'taking', 'back', 'seat', 'times', 'others', ""n't"", 'engage', 'much', 'hand', 'hand', 'editing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'flow', 'looking', 'old', 'school', 'Steven', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'reality', 'time', 'up', 'Nonetheless', 'Seagal', 'film', 'making', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'escape', 'action', 'film', 'aficionados']",N/A

733797,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000844MD,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","""Half Past Dead"" features so-so action sequences, incoherent plot, and Steven Seagal who hasn't changed his style for more than 15 years.  All those factors are all right if there is something good about the result, like in ""Under Siege.""  Did I find that?  Sorry, but the answer's no.The story means nothing here, but that is OK.  In Alcatraz. a newly-made prison is now in operation (the film says), and Seagal's character Sascha Petrosevitch and his buddy Nick (Ja Rule) are sent into the cells there.  At the same time, a man in death row is going to the chair, and the judge who presided the case is watching over the proceedings.  AND moreover, a group of heavily-armed terrorists arrive there to take over the place, to make the film look like ""The Rock 2"" or ""Die Hard 4.""ALl those situations are acceptable as long as actions are good.  And fortunately, we got Hong-Kong born action coordinator Xing Xing Xiong, who provides pretty powerful action sequences.  The short but impressive fighting scenes between Ja Rule and Nia Peeples are most memorable among them.But it's Seagal who drags everyting down.  I've been watching his films since his debut, but the fast and deadly movement which only real martial arts specialists can do is sadly gone.  Please don't say I am wrong -- see his actions back in the 1990s -- he is clearly out of shape, and you should know that.Some of the actors are still doing their best -- Nia Peeples is excellent as a dangerous killer -- and you might enjoy the veterans' faces (Linda Thorson, 'Tara King' of the original ""The Avengers"" for instance).  But they are all wasted, and the slow and tedious script cannot be saved from the messy job by the repeated flashy MTV-like cameras.",2,"Looks Like Unofficial Spin-off of ""The Rock"" (with no Nick)",1053648000,"05 23, 2003",2003,1725,"['Past', 'Dead', 'so-so', 'action', 'sequences', 'incoherent', 'plot', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'who', ""n't"", 'changed', 'style', 'more', '15', 'years', 'factors', 'are', 'all', 'right', 'something', 'good', 'result', 'Siege', 'Did', 'find', 'Sorry', 'answer', 'no.The', 'story', 'nothing', 'here', 'OK', 'Alcatraz', 'newly-made', 'prison', 'now', 'operation', 'film', 'Seagal', 'character', 'Sascha', 'Petrosevitch', 'buddy', 'Nick', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'are', 'sent', 'cells', 'there', 'same', 'time', 'man', 'death', 'row', 'going', 'chair', 'judge', 'who', 'presided', 'case', 'watching', 'proceedings', 'moreover', 'group', 'heavily-armed', 'terrorists', 'arrive', 'there', 'take', 'over', 'place', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'Rock', '2', 'Die', 'Hard', '4', 'ALl', 'situations', 'are', 'acceptable', 'as', 'long', 'actions', 'are', 'good', 'fortunately', 'got', 'Hong-Kong', 'born', 'action', 'coordinator', 'Xing', 'Xing', 'Xiong', 'who', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'action', 'sequences', 'short', 'impressive', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'Nia', 'Peeples', 'are', 'most', 'memorable', 'Seagal', 'who', 'everyting', 'down', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'films', 'debut', 'fast', 'deadly', 'movement', 'only', 'real', 'martial', 'arts', 'specialists', 'can', 'do', 'sadly', 'gone', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'am', 'wrong', 'see', 'actions', 'back', '1990s', 'clearly', 'shape', 'should', 'know', 'that.Some', 'actors', 'are', 'still', 'doing', 'best', 'Nia', 'Peeples', 'excellent', 'dangerous', 'killer', 'might', 'enjoy', 'veterans', 'Linda', 'Thorson', ""'Tara"", 'King', 'original', 'Avengers', 'instance', 'are', 'wasted', 'slow', 'tedious', 'script', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'saved', 'messy', 'job', 'repeated', 'flashy', 'MTV-like', 'cameras']",N/A
