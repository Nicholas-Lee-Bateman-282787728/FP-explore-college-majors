This was not done well.  It's barely even funny.  The first 3 seasons were great and made EBD one of the funniest shows ever.  I don't know what happened with the writers on this one.  It's almost like they weren't even trying.  I own the first three seasons, but will never be buying this one or watching it again.  I'd like to forget that Season 4 was ever made.",2,What a Crappy Way to Go Out!,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,485,"['season', 'sucked', 'far', 'worst', 'saying', ""'ve"", 'got', 'job', 'do', ""'ve"", 'got', 'do', 'well', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'well', 'barely', 'even', 'funny', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'were', 'great', 'made', 'EBD', 'one', 'funniest', 'ever', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'writers', 'one', 'almost', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'trying', 'own', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'buying', 'one', 'watching', 'again', ""'d"", 'like', 'forget', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

Henning ""bond_girl_double07""","[1, 3]","I don't think there's any doubt that Eastbound and Down is one of the funniest comedy series to come along in a long time.  Every season, Kenny Powers managed to be one of the worst humans ever put to film, but somehow to make you root for him in the end.  Even though he consistently made selfish decisions and treated other people horribly, there was still an ember of a good guy underneath all the craziness.  Plus there were so many situations in the other seasons that were just too hilarious not to make you laugh and forgive Kenny a little bit..  He was over the top way more than he was right.  The fourth season takes most of the characters to a really dark place, and I didn't feel like there was enough redemption to bring up that tail spin.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, but those of you who have seen the season know what I'm talking about.  I did think the last episode was pretty amazing, but I'm not sure it was good enough to bring up the rest of the season.Also where is Ashley Schaefer?!  Come on?!

1672308,A1V9OKVCPJSAHD,B00FOHHMWI,Barbara Streisand,"[1, 2]",The 4th Season is a great one. I didn't know how they could take Kenny further but they reached a great story arc and provided lots of laughs and dark moments. I liked the 4th season and applaud the writing and character development. I love the way Kenny burns the a-holes. Low brow but the show reflects a kind of insanity that is common in the general population.Great job cast and crew.,5,Funneey!,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,389,"['4th', 'Season', 'great', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'could', 'take', 'Kenny', 'further', 'reached', 'great', 'story', 'arc', 'provided', 'lots', 'laughs', 'dark', 'moments', 'liked', '4th', 'season', 'applaud', 'writing', 'character', 'development', 'love', 'way', 'Kenny', 'a-holes', 'Low', 'brow', 'show', 'kind', 'insanity', 'common', 'general', 'population.Great', 'job', 'cast', 'crew']",N/A

It's as hilarious as ever, but also it's a great character study. The season starts off with Kenny living as a normal everyday guy working at a car rental place. Although he hates his job, he has a loving wife and family, but that isn't enough for KP. One of my favorite moments of the show is when April is getting an award for being the best real estate agent, Kenny is standing in the back of the crowd listening to her acceptance speech, not happy, but angry. Is this really his life?I don't want to spoil anything that happens, but definitely check out this season (and the others, obviously-- but you probably already have), it has not disappointed so far.I will edit this review after the conclusion of the season, and series. I am excited, scared, and just flat out sad for what the final episodes of Eastbound & Down will hold.--UPDATED--Wow, what a finish. This season was flawless in my opinion, and it ended on a truly remarkable and hilarious note. Will go down as one of the funniest shows to ever grace television, without a doubt.",5,Could this be the best season of Eastbound & Down... ever?,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,1211,"['Man', 'am', 'happy', 'Mr.', 'McBride', 'co.', 'came', 'back', 'one', 'more', 'season.Only', '5', 'episodes', 'really', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'season', 'Eastbound', 'Down', 'yet', 'as', 'hilarious', 'ever', 'also', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'season', 'off', 'Kenny', 'living', 'normal', 'everyday', 'guy', 'working', 'car', 'rental', 'place', 'job', 'loving', 'wife', 'family', ""n't"", 'enough', 'KP', 'One', 'favorite', 'moments', 'show', 'when', 'April', 'getting', 'award', 'being', 'best', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'Kenny', 'standing', 'back', 'crowd', 'listening', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'not', 'happy', 'angry', 'really', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'season', 'others', 'obviously', 'probably', 'already', 'have', 'not', 'disappointed', 'so', 'far.I', 'will', 'edit', 'review', 'conclusion', 'season', 'series', 'am', 'excited', 'scared', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'sad', 'what', 'final', 'episodes', 'Eastbound', 'Down', 'will', 'hold.', 'UPDATED', 'Wow', 'what', 'finish', 'season', 'was', 'flawless', 'opinion', 'ended', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'hilarious', 'note', 'Will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'funniest', 'shows', 'ever', 'grace', 'television', 'doubt']",N/A
