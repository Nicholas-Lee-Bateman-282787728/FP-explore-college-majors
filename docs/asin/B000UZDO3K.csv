1097818,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000UZDO3K,Acute Observer,"[3, 7]","The film begins with a celebration for newspaper people. Miss Jane Froman sings for them. The story began in Cincinnati with her audition at a radio station. Jane sings with her trained voice and gets a job. Soon she is a star in Chicago. Her manager Don Ross gets her mor money. Next Froman plays at Radio City in New York. Hollywood was next. Froman was now a star. But trouble begins with her husband Don. [Does it seem like the Hollywood version of her life?] Jane Froman volunteers to entertain the troops after Pearl Harbor. A four-engine flying boat takes them to Lisbon. There is a crash landing, and the travelers go to a hospital. Forman's leg was nearly amputated below the knee, an ankle was crushed. But she survived, and returned to New York for more medical treatment.There is more singing in the hospital. Froman returns to the stage and a hit show. But her leg causes problems and multiple operations. Will her leg have to come off? Will Froman break off her friendship with that co-pilot? Her performance is staged to hide her handicap. Froman returns to Europe to entertain wounded troops in a hospital, and other places. The ending has many songs [like some opera]. The singing and dancing was the hallmark of 20th Century-Fox films. It is a typical Hollywood entertainment that glides over any controversial topic. [Are the lives of today's singers much different?]An Internet search said Froman had a cut below her left knee that nearly severed her leg. She had a compound fracture of her right leg, and multiple fractures of her right arm. Pilot John Burns held on to her to keep her afloat until the rescue. They later married, but divorced. Jane's father left home when she was five years old, she developed a stutter that vanished when she sang.",3,Jane Froman's Life,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,1771,"['film', 'celebration', 'newspaper', 'people', 'Miss', 'Jane', 'Froman', 'sings', 'story', 'began', 'Cincinnati', 'audition', 'radio', 'station', 'Jane', 'sings', 'trained', 'voice', 'job', 'Soon', 'star', 'Chicago', 'manager', 'Don', 'Ross', 'mor', 'money', 'Next', 'Froman', 'Radio', 'City', 'New', 'York', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'next', 'Froman', 'was', 'now', 'star', 'trouble', 'husband', 'Don', '[', 'seem', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'life', ']', 'Jane', 'Froman', 'volunteers', 'entertain', 'troops', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'four-engine', 'flying', 'boat', 'Lisbon', 'crash', 'landing', 'travelers', 'go', 'hospital', 'Forman', 'leg', 'was', 'nearly', 'amputated', 'knee', 'ankle', 'was', 'crushed', 'survived', 'returned', 'New', 'York', 'more', 'medical', 'more', 'singing', 'hospital', 'Froman', 'stage', 'hit', 'show', 'leg', 'causes', 'problems', 'multiple', 'operations', 'Will', 'leg', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'Will', 'Froman', 'break', 'off', 'friendship', 'co-pilot', 'performance', 'staged', 'hide', 'handicap', 'Froman', 'Europe', 'entertain', 'wounded', 'troops', 'hospital', 'other', 'places', 'ending', 'many', 'songs', '[', 'opera', ']', 'singing', 'dancing', 'was', 'hallmark', '20th', 'Century-Fox', 'films', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'entertainment', 'controversial', 'topic', 'Are', 'lives', 'today', 'singers', 'much', 'different', 'Internet', 'search', 'said', 'Froman', 'had', 'cut', 'left', 'knee', 'nearly', 'severed', 'leg', 'had', 'compound', 'fracture', 'right', 'leg', 'multiple', 'fractures', 'right', 'arm', 'Pilot', 'John', 'Burns', 'held', 'keep', 'afloat', 'rescue', 'later', 'married', 'divorced', 'Jane', 'father', 'left', 'home', 'when', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'developed', 'stutter', 'vanished', 'when', 'sang']",With a Song in My Heart - The Jane Froman Story

She could be fun, she could be quite imperious.  She sang pop songs but sang them like a Wagnerian mezzo soprano.  Her stage demeanor was formal, her private demeanor totally down to earth when she wasn't in a star mood.  She was magnetic, charismatic and even more gorgeous than her photos show.  I think everyone who knew her was fascinated by her.  Our paths crossed when I was a student at the  University of Missouri in Columbia in 1962.  I still have the lovely note she sent to my dorm to thank me for an editorial I wrote about her coming home in the Columbia Missourian.  She was Columbia's favorite girl, that's for sure.  The film remains glorious in his production numbers, costuming and often surprisingly sophisticated script and Hayward is the true miracle quotient.",5,Susan Hayward was a genius,1209081600,"04 25, 2008",2008,1267,"['Song', 'My', 'Heart', 'matchless', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'playing', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'who', 'almost', 'nothing', 'do', 'real', 'Jane', 'Froman', 'amazing', 'how', 'very', 'shallow', 'fast-moving', 'snappy', 'script', 'somehow', 'up', 'riveting', 'performance', 'life', 'Jane', 'had', 'many', 'sides', 'University', 'Missouri', 'was', 'popular', 'girl', 'campus', 'star', 'whom', 'everything', 'seemed', 'come', 'easy', 'few', 'people', 'knew', 'difficult', 'life', 'story', 'even', 'young', 'age', 'could', 'be', 'fun', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'imperious', 'sang', 'pop', 'songs', 'sang', 'Wagnerian', 'mezzo', 'soprano', 'stage', 'demeanor', 'was', 'formal', 'private', 'demeanor', 'totally', 'down', 'earth', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'star', 'mood', 'was', 'magnetic', 'charismatic', 'even', 'more', 'gorgeous', 'photos', 'show', 'think', 'everyone', 'who', 'knew', 'was', 'fascinated', 'paths', 'crossed', 'when', 'was', 'student', 'University', 'Missouri', 'Columbia', '1962', 'still', 'have', 'lovely', 'note', 'sent', 'dorm', 'thank', 'editorial', 'wrote', 'coming', 'home', 'Columbia', 'Missourian', 'was', 'Columbia', 'favorite', 'girl', 'sure', 'film', 'glorious', 'production', 'numbers', 'costuming', 'often', 'surprisingly', 'sophisticated', 'script', 'Hayward', 'true', 'miracle', 'quotient']",With a Song in My Heart - The Jane Froman Story

However, I got to hear a lot of Jane Froman because it was her voice that we heard coming out of Susan Hayward's mouth.

However, the last major scene was of Miss Froman singing to GI's at a hospital (somewhere in Europe if I'm not mistaken).

Robertson""","[110, 114]","This movie has never been released in ANY format so this is a cause for celebration for this highly sought after flick. Many fine reviews have already preceded mine (considering it is not yet available) so I will not rehash the plot but give what I hope will be interesting insights into the making of this fine film.Susan during her contract with FOX were her most visible superstardom years and it has always struck me a bit odd little has been released by the studio considering a quarter of their budget was wrapped up in her movies alone. She was the only star at Grauman's to place her hands, footprints and signature in cement embedded in gold dust. Hayward's famous long red tresses were insured for a million dollars and could only be trimmed a half inch. She was allowed to have it cut shoulder length since she bore some resemblence to Jane Froman. She spent hours in the recording booth watching Froman sing the songs used on the soundtrack, noting her every gesture and movement which explains why her lip syncing job is one of the best on celluloid. Her lavish wardrobe was not for glamor but character, as Froman was voted consistently one of the top 10 best dressed women of her time. Her elaborate dance routines took weeks of rehearsal and during one shot, her breast was flashed during a daily rush and and had to be reshot. A young Bob Wagner credits his success to Hayward for taking him under her wing. This was his first major film albeit a small part and he had to cry in one scene while Hayward was singing which he found difficult to execute. Hayward deliberately had the camers focused on the back of her head during the scene as she prompted him to tears. In the 70's he remarked on THE TONIGHT SHOW what a tremendous help she was to a young struggling actor. Susan was not one for making friends with her peers; however, the ascerbic Thelma Ritter as her nurse and companion became life-long friends. Ritter who was also nominated for an oscar should have won. She was overlooked by the Academy 6 times and never received an award of any type. Poor judgement indeed.Susan made many top money making films for Fox and was always voted one of the top 10 most popular movies during her tenure with FOX yet few have been released and this is her only Oscar nod during her contract with the company. She was cast in big budget movies and given interesting scenes to appeal to her creative talents and despite the overblown budgets, she always managed to bring a close intimacy to the moviegoing public. The next year after SONG she was given her best and most overlooked role as the maligned Rachel Jackeson in THE PRESIDENT'S LADY co-starring a fairly junior Charleton Heston. He was one of her better male leads as their chemistry on screen crackled with electricity.This grand scale musical was the biggest moneymaker in it's category for 1952 and she was voted the ""Most Popular Female Star of 1952"" and won a Golden Globe award. Here it is...and it's a long time coming. This one woman show leans towards sentimentality at times, but Hayward never allows it to become maudlin. Under her cabable hands she has managed to give one of the finest musical performances in film history.This is a classic movie for everyone in the family to enjoy. Sit back and watch a real pro at work here. She is that rare combination of beauty and talent that is seldom found in Hollywood.A one of a kind movie with a one of a kind actress--the great Susan Hayward. And it is tragic she died at the age of 56 just as she was returning to movies and having great success in important made for TV movies (at a time when this medium was usually silly fare).ABOUT TIME!!!!

1097856,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B000UZDO3K,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[34, 35]","""With a Song in My Heart"" is one of those films that has never been released on VHS or DVD.  It's about time 20th Century-Fox plans to release it to coordinate with what would have been Jane Froman's 100th birthday.  The film features a superb performance by Susan Hayward as Froman, who lip synchs to Froman's actual singing flawlessly.  The script is standard Hollywood biopic, but the music is absolutely terrific, from Rodgers & Hart's ""Blue Moon"" to an elaborate production number of the title song to a rousing medley of patriotic and state songs.  A new biography of Froman, ""Say It With Music: The Life & Legacy of Jane Froman,"" fills in the gaps the movie doesn't cover and traces Froman's life from her return to performing in the States to her TV show of the 1950's to her years of retirement in Columbia, Missouri.  Other songs in the film include ""I'm Thru With Love,""  ""Embraceable You,"" ""The Right Kind,"" ""They're Either Too Young or Too Old,""  ""On the Gay White Way,"" and ""That Old Feeling.""",5,Finally on DVD!,1192665600,"10 18, 2007",2007,1007,"['Song', 'My', 'Heart', 'one', 'films', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'time', '20th', 'Century-Fox', 'plans', 'release', 'coordinate', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Jane', 'Froman', '100th', 'birthday', 'film', 'superb', 'performance', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'Froman', 'who', 'lip', 'synchs', 'Froman', 'actual', 'singing', 'flawlessly', 'script', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'biopic', 'music', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'Rodgers', 'Hart', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'elaborate', 'production', 'number', 'title', 'song', 'rousing', 'medley', 'patriotic', 'state', 'songs', 'new', 'biography', 'Froman', 'Say', 'Music', 'Life', 'Legacy', 'Jane', 'Froman', 'gaps', 'movie', ""n't"", 'cover', 'traces', 'Froman', 'life', 'return', 'performing', 'States', 'TV', 'show', '1950', 'years', 'retirement', 'Columbia', 'Missouri', 'Other', 'songs', 'film', 'include', ""'m"", 'Thru', 'Love', 'Embraceable', 'Right', 'Kind', ""'re"", 'Too', 'Young', 'Too', 'Old', 'Gay', 'White', 'Way', 'Old', 'Feeling']",With a Song in My Heart - The Jane Froman Story
1097857,A35V32HZEGZH04,B000UZDO3K,"W. Easley ""Opa""","[2, 2]","For anyone who likes musicals, this film is especially appealing.  With a Song in My Heart is the story of Jane Froman, a wonderful singer and one of the most courageous performers in United States entertainment history.Over the years many performers have joined USO tours to entertain the troops.  Jane was especially generous with her time and talent.  Despite severe injures she suffered in a plane crash (39 operations and a continued threat to amputate her leg) she traveled  throughout the World War II European theater and, in crutches, gave 95 performances for the troops.Susan Hayward stars as Jane and does a great job.  Jane herself does the singing (no one can match her voice), but Susan Hayward beams during the singing and is convincing in the hospital scenes.Rodgers and Hart wrote the superior musical score.  In addition to the title song, the film includes excellent productions of:  ""That Old Feeling,""  ""I'm Through With  Love,""  ""Blue Moon,""  ""Embraceable You,""  ""It's A Good Day,"" and ""I'll Walk Alone.""Lavish costumes highlight Jane's performances.  She appears in flowing and beautifully designed gowns that enhance her appearances before the many audiences.The narration for this movie alternates among the supporting cast of David Wayne, Rory Calhoun, and Thelma Ritter.  David Wayne plays Don Ross, Jane's husband and manager, and provides most of the narration.Rory Calhoun plays aircrewman John Burn, who is a fellow survivor and convalescent  after the terrible airplane accident that caused Jane's disability.  John becomes her one true love (whom she temporarily gives up for her marriage)Thelma Ritter portrays nurse Clancy who nurses Jane for the many months of her convalescence.  Clancy is Jane's cheerleader; she keeps Jane together.  Despite her sarcasm, Clancy is  saucy, funny, and a supporting angel.The wonderful soundtrack, beautiful costumes and superior story of a true artist and gracious person, combined with good acting, make With a Song in My Heart an excellent movie. Although I had seen the movie when it originally was released, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the high quality production again.  I highly recommend this DVD for fans of popular music and people who enjoy tales of heroism.",5,Superior Singing,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,2239,"['anyone', 'who', 'musicals', 'film', 'especially', 'appealing', 'Song', 'My', 'Heart', 'story', 'Jane', 'Froman', 'wonderful', 'singer', 'one', 'most', 'courageous', 'performers', 'United', 'States', 'entertainment', 'years', 'many', 'performers', 'have', 'joined', 'USO', 'tours', 'entertain', 'troops', 'Jane', 'was', 'especially', 'generous', 'time', 'talent', 'severe', 'injures', 'suffered', 'plane', 'crash', '39', 'operations', 'continued', 'threat', 'amputate', 'leg', 'traveled', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'European', 'theater', 'crutches', 'gave', '95', 'performances', 'troops.Susan', 'Hayward', 'Jane', 'great', 'job', 'Jane', 'singing', 'one', 'can', 'match', 'voice', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'beams', 'singing', 'convincing', 'hospital', 'scenes.Rodgers', 'Hart', 'wrote', 'superior', 'musical', 'score', 'addition', 'title', 'song', 'film', 'excellent', 'productions', 'Old', 'Feeling', ""'m"", 'Love', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'Embraceable', 'Good', 'Day', ""'ll"", 'Walk', 'Alone', 'Lavish', 'costumes', 'highlight', 'Jane', 'performances', 'flowing', 'beautifully', 'designed', 'gowns', 'enhance', 'appearances', 'many', 'audiences.The', 'narration', 'movie', 'supporting', 'cast', 'David', 'Wayne', 'Rory', 'Calhoun', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'David', 'Wayne', 'Don', 'Ross', 'Jane', 'husband', 'manager', 'most', 'narration.Rory', 'Calhoun', 'aircrewman', 'John', 'Burn', 'who', 'fellow', 'survivor', 'convalescent', 'terrible', 'airplane', 'accident', 'caused', 'Jane', 'disability', 'John', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'whom', 'temporarily', 'up', 'marriage', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'nurse', 'Clancy', 'who', 'Jane', 'many', 'months', 'convalescence', 'Clancy', 'Jane', 'cheerleader', 'Jane', 'together', 'sarcasm', 'Clancy', 'saucy', 'funny', 'supporting', 'angel.The', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'superior', 'story', 'true', 'artist', 'gracious', 'person', 'combined', 'good', 'acting', 'make', 'Song', 'My', 'Heart', 'excellent', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'when', 'originally', 'was', 'released', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'high', 'quality', 'production', 'again', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'fans', 'popular', 'music', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'tales', 'heroism']",With a Song in My Heart - The Jane Froman Story
