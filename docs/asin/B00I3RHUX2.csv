1693378,A12XN92F75DU19,B00I3RHUX2,"David S. Raby ""OleJoe""","[2, 2]","I purchased this set to watch a single episode -- &#34;The Good Luck Charm&#34; with guest star Gloria Swanson.  In particular, I wanted to see the performance of a young (then) actress named Jena Engstrom who played the dying young woman who considered the former movie star played by Gloria Swanson to be her good luck charm.  As expected, Jena Engstrom was great; she left acting in 1964 because of her health, not because of lack of talent.  As for the series and the episode, I was suprised that I liked them.  This series came out after I had enlisted in the Army and was overseas (Europe).  I don't recall ever watching it after I left the Army.  It has not been shown on TV much and I expected that I would find it to be like so many other shows of the 1960s -- a cringe-worthy view of how we saw ourselves back then.  It is better than than, and a lot of that is probably due to Richard Chamberlain who always has had a good screen presence.  As for the episode &#34;The Good Luck Charm,&#34; I liked it to.  I suspect that forever played versions of Norma Desmond after the 1950 film &#34;Sunset Boulevard.&#34;  I think it is one of the great movie performances ever.  And Julia Colton is a version of Norma Desmond, but Norma Desmond was insane, Julia Colton is not.  She is  an actress whose greatness is behind her and the loss of attention has made her fragile and vulnerable while still presenting an over-the-top persona to her diminishing fan base.  The story of how an admiring dying woman makes this star of the past come to grips with reality is a good piece of story telling.",5,"""The Good Luck Charm"" episode with guest star Gloria Swanson is very good.",1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,1597,"['purchased', 'set', 'watch', 'single', 'episode', '34', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Charm', '34', 'guest', 'star', 'Gloria', 'Swanson', 'particular', 'wanted', 'see', 'performance', 'young', 'then', 'actress', 'named', 'Jena', 'Engstrom', 'who', 'played', 'dying', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'considered', 'former', 'movie', 'star', 'played', 'Gloria', 'Swanson', 'be', 'good', 'luck', 'charm', 'expected', 'Jena', 'Engstrom', 'was', 'great', 'left', 'acting', '1964', 'health', 'not', 'lack', 'talent', 'series', 'episode', 'was', 'suprised', 'liked', 'series', 'came', 'had', 'enlisted', 'Army', 'was', 'overseas', 'Europe', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'watching', 'left', 'Army', 'not', 'been', 'shown', 'TV', 'much', 'expected', 'would', 'find', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'shows', '1960s', 'cringe-worthy', 'view', 'how', 'saw', 'back', 'then', 'better', 'lot', 'probably', 'due', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'who', 'always', 'had', 'good', 'screen', 'presence', 'episode', '34', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Charm', '34', 'liked', 'suspect', 'forever', 'played', 'versions', 'Norma', 'Desmond', '1950', 'film', '34', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard.', '34', 'think', 'one', 'great', 'movie', 'performances', 'ever', 'Julia', 'Colton', 'version', 'Norma', 'Desmond', 'Norma', 'Desmond', 'was', 'insane', 'Julia', 'Colton', 'not', 'actress', 'greatness', 'loss', 'attention', 'made', 'fragile', 'vulnerable', 'while', 'still', 'presenting', 'over-the-top', 'persona', 'diminishing', 'fan', 'base', 'story', 'how', 'admiring', 'dying', 'woman', 'star', 'past', 'come', 'grips', 'reality', 'good', 'piece', 'story', 'telling']",Dr. Kildare: The Complete Second Season - Back to Back 2 Pack

It is so fun, to go back in time, remembering how our family gathered to watch this exciting medical series every Thursday evening. Like everyone back then, I believe I had a crush on the gorgeous Richard Chamberlain, and I chuckle at times, when I realize that the handsome actor has written to me numerous times over the years, and actually called to talk with me, when he was in Portland doing a few segments of Leverage, which is filmed here. Had I known back then, that I would EVER even speak to the actor, I wouldn't have believed it. He is just as nice, and down-to-earth, in person, as he is on the screen.

1693386,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B00I3RHUX2,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[1, 1]","Doctor Kildare was actually before my time.  I was a kid so young, I never experienced Doctor Kildare when the show aired in prime time. I had always heard of Doctor Kildare in movies and I had a few and liked them. So when I saw this Doctor Kildare DVD set I had to give them a chance.  I am happy I brought Seasons One and Two of Doctor Kildare.  Like season one Dr Kildare is a young idealistic doctor being led by the sometimes kindly, always blunt fatherly advice of an elder doctor.Doctor Kildare wants to be a world class diagnostitian. Dr Kildares failing he is a young idealist as such he is susceptible to all the flights of fancy that led young men away from the common sense virtues of their respective callings.  Doctor Kildare faces the death of his patients and the moral quagmires that come from their struggles.  Dr. Kildare is thust into confront various social ills like drug abuse, alcoholism and disfunctional families all cleaned up enough to pass 1950's sensibilities and network censorship.It's awesome seeing all the old cars that were in this time brand new.  If you know anything at all about medicine its fun to watch them prescribe treatments that have been replaced or debunked as bad medicine.  It was at first funny to watch Dr. Kildare deal with a Smallpox patient when in 2014 the only living small pox viruses live in cold storage in assorted labs. I never saw what smallpox looked like. I was asstounded seeing what it looked like on one episode of Dr. Kildare. Also I did not know smallpox was so easily transmitted as it appears on the show.  Dr. Kildare gave me a new respect for smallpox that those who suffered with it.What Dr. Kildare showed was state of the art medicine at the time it aired. Another thing that struck me is how dark, depressing and cavernous Blair General Hospital the hospital hallways, rooms and wards always looked. The so called Hospital Ward has been almost completely replaced by the semi-private room.  The hospital ward where the poorest patients were placed in one large cummunal bedroom sorted by race and gender of course is a thing of the past now. Todays hospitals are soaring edifices of glass, steel and concrete, metal and brick. Todays hospitals are bathed in light which is a 180 about face compared to the hospital Dr. Kildare calls home. Today's hospitals are filled with art work and exciting structure all designed to create an atmosphere of healing. Blair General Hospital was dungeon like in design, its rooms like prison wards. Also looking at Dr. Kildare and you see how far the profession of nursing has come in 2014.  In Dr Kildare's time nurses were not much more than maids with a little medical knowledge. Today's nurse is part administrator, social worker, healer and leiazon between patient and all others. Today there are medical assistants to do the scutt work that nurses performed in Doctor Kildares time.Doctor Kildare is filled with stereotypes bums are always drunken sots laying in the gutter victim of bad choices rather than the lack of jobs or opportunity. Fallen ladies lacking wifely virtues are clearly indicated in an Doctor Kildare story. I find Dr. Kildare interesting on many different levels.  Dr. Kildare is interesting for the social commentary and insights it gives to the culture of the United States in the 1950's. This series is a sort of Norman Rockwells view of hospital life with clean cut All American Dr. Kildare fighting evil disease, rescuing the innocent and curing the sick at least till they died.  On Doctor Kildare they died boy did they die.  If you base your experiences on Dr. Kildare the body count was high in hospitals of the time but no where near the death rate at the hospital where Ben Casey hailed but thats another review.Surfice to say that Dr. Kildare is interesting in many fronts even if its medical treatments which were cutting edge medicine in their day have most long ago lost relevence in 2014. I brought this Season Two and Season One of Dr Kildare and am happy I did. If you know what to expect going in Doctor Kildare never disappoints. Dr. Kildare is a look back at idealistic 1950's life as seem from the eyes of a young energetic doctor who wants to change thew world for the better!",5,WATCH THE SHOW OBSERVE THE BODY COUNT - BACK WHEN HOSPITALS WERE THE PLACE YOU DIED!,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,4241,"['Doctor', 'Kildare', 'was', 'actually', 'time', 'was', 'kid', 'so', 'young', 'never', 'experienced', 'Doctor', 'Kildare', 'when', 'show', 'aired', 'prime', 'time', 'had', 'always', 'heard', 'Doctor', 'Kildare', 'movies', 'had', 'few', 'liked', 'when', 'saw', 'Doctor', 'Kildare', 'DVD', 'set', 'had', 'give', 'chance', 'am', 'happy', 'brought', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'Doctor', 'Kildare', 'season', 'one', 'Dr', 'Kildare', 'young', 'idealistic', 'doctor', 'being', 'led', 'sometimes', 'kindly', 'always', 'blunt', 'fatherly', 'advice', 'elder', 'doctor.Doctor', 'Kildare', 'be', 'world', 'class', 'diagnostitian', 'Dr', 'failing', 'young', 'idealist', 'such', 'susceptible', 'flights', 'fancy', 'led', 'young', 'men', 'away', 'common', 'sense', 'virtues', 'respective', 'callings', 'Doctor', 'Kildare', 'death', 'patients', 'moral', 'quagmires', 'come', 'struggles', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'thust', 'confront', 'various', 'social', 'ills', 'drug', 'abuse', 'alcoholism', 'disfunctional', 'families', 'cleaned', 'up', 'enough', 'pass', '1950', 'sensibilities', 'network', 'censorship.It', 'awesome', 'seeing', 'old', 'cars', 'were', 'time', 'brand', 'new', 'know', 'anything', 'medicine', 'fun', 'watch', 'prescribe', 'treatments', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'debunked', 'bad', 'medicine', 'was', 'first', 'funny', 'watch', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'deal', 'Smallpox', 'patient', 'when', '2014', 'only', 'living', 'small', 'pox', 'viruses', 'live', 'cold', 'storage', 'assorted', 'labs', 'never', 'saw', 'what', 'smallpox', 'looked', 'was', 'asstounded', 'seeing', 'what', 'looked', 'one', 'episode', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'Also', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'smallpox', 'was', 'so', 'easily', 'transmitted', 'show', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'gave', 'new', 'respect', 'smallpox', 'who', 'suffered', 'it.What', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'showed', 'was', 'state', 'art', 'medicine', 'time', 'aired', 'thing', 'struck', 'how', 'dark', 'depressing', 'cavernous', 'Blair', 'General', 'Hospital', 'hospital', 'hallways', 'rooms', 'wards', 'always', 'looked', 'so', 'called', 'Hospital', 'Ward', 'been', 'almost', 'completely', 'replaced', 'semi-private', 'room', 'hospital', 'ward', 'where', 'poorest', 'patients', 'were', 'placed', 'one', 'large', 'cummunal', 'bedroom', 'sorted', 'race', 'gender', 'course', 'thing', 'past', 'now', 'Todays', 'hospitals', 'are', 'soaring', 'edifices', 'glass', 'steel', 'concrete', 'metal', 'brick', 'Todays', 'hospitals', 'are', 'bathed', 'light', '180', 'face', 'compared', 'hospital', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'home', 'Today', 'hospitals', 'are', 'filled', 'art', 'work', 'exciting', 'structure', 'designed', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'healing', 'Blair', 'General', 'Hospital', 'was', 'dungeon', 'design', 'rooms', 'prison', 'wards', 'Also', 'looking', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'profession', 'nursing', 'come', '2014', 'Dr', 'Kildare', 'time', 'nurses', 'were', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'maids', 'little', 'medical', 'knowledge', 'Today', 'nurse', 'part', 'administrator', 'social', 'worker', 'healer', 'leiazon', 'patient', 'others', 'Today', 'are', 'medical', 'assistants', 'do', 'scutt', 'work', 'performed', 'Doctor', 'Kildares', 'time.Doctor', 'Kildare', 'filled', 'stereotypes', 'bums', 'are', 'always', 'drunken', 'sots', 'laying', 'gutter', 'victim', 'bad', 'choices', 'rather', 'lack', 'jobs', 'opportunity', 'Fallen', 'lacking', 'wifely', 'virtues', 'are', 'clearly', 'indicated', 'Doctor', 'Kildare', 'story', 'find', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'interesting', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'interesting', 'social', 'commentary', 'insights', 'culture', 'United', 'States', '1950', 'series', 'sort', 'Norman', 'Rockwells', 'view', 'hospital', 'life', 'clean', 'cut', 'American', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'fighting', 'evil', 'disease', 'rescuing', 'innocent', 'curing', 'sick', 'least', 'till', 'died', 'Doctor', 'Kildare', 'died', 'boy', 'did', 'die', 'base', 'experiences', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'body', 'count', 'was', 'high', 'hospitals', 'time', 'where', 'death', 'rate', 'hospital', 'where', 'Ben', 'Casey', 'hailed', 'review.Surfice', 'say', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'interesting', 'many', 'fronts', 'even', 'medical', 'treatments', 'were', 'cutting', 'edge', 'medicine', 'day', 'have', 'most', 'long', 'ago', 'lost', 'relevence', '2014', 'brought', 'Season', 'Two', 'Season', 'One', 'Dr', 'Kildare', 'am', 'happy', 'did', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'going', 'Doctor', 'Kildare', 'never', 'disappoints', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'look', 'back', 'idealistic', '1950', 'life', 'seem', 'eyes', 'young', 'energetic', 'doctor', 'who', 'change', 'thew', 'world', 'better']",Dr. Kildare: The Complete Second Season - Back to Back 2 Pack
