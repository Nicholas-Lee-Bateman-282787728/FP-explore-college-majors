925708,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000AARKY4,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[2, 2]","The moral issues presented in FMA is something you'd find in some of the more classical works of literature, not in an anime aimed at teenagers. Yet it all works as the series never gets away from the fact that it is dealing with some of the most basic concepts of being human. Hell, FMA's bad-guys are even named after the Seven Deadly Sins.This volume continues with Ed and Al's fight within and outside the prison against creatures that are very akin to Alphonse. Eventually, though, the brother's find themselves facing off against the main antagonists of the series (the aforementioned Seven Deadly Sins). Later, Alphonse must face the fact that he's losing his memories and must also figure out a few things on his own, like whether or not he ever truly existed as the brother to Edward Elric, and what exactly it is to be human. Also, Scar takes center stage more than once in this volume in a somewhat surprising way...FMA's ability to juggle the massive cast is brilliant. I think I can name almost every character in FMA (and for me, this is something as I'm very forgetful of names), simply because each and every character has something endearing about them. That includes the bit-players who are there simply to fill a moment of the series or to progress a specific scene ahead.If you haven't started collecting FMA yet, then start quickly. There aren't many anime out right now that can top FMA. It has everything great anime has: great story, great characters, great music, great animation. Though it may be cliche to say this, FMA is one of the top five anime ever created, and any fan of anime would be foolish to let this slip by them.",5,What Is Human?,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,1653,"['moral', 'issues', 'presented', 'FMA', 'something', ""'d"", 'find', 'more', 'classical', 'works', 'literature', 'not', 'anime', 'aimed', 'teenagers', 'series', 'never', 'away', 'fact', 'dealing', 'most', 'basic', 'concepts', 'being', 'human', 'Hell', 'FMA', 'bad-guys', 'are', 'even', 'named', 'Seven', 'Deadly', 'Sins.This', 'volume', 'Ed', 'Al', 'fight', 'prison', 'creatures', 'are', 'very', 'akin', 'Alphonse', 'Eventually', 'brother', 'find', 'facing', 'off', 'main', 'antagonists', 'series', 'aforementioned', 'Seven', 'Deadly', 'Sins', 'Later', 'Alphonse', 'must', 'face', 'fact', 'losing', 'memories', 'must', 'also', 'figure', 'out', 'few', 'things', 'own', 'not', 'ever', 'truly', 'existed', 'brother', 'Edward', 'Elric', 'what', 'exactly', 'be', 'human', 'Also', 'Scar', 'center', 'stage', 'more', 'once', 'volume', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'way', 'FMA', 'ability', 'juggle', 'massive', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'think', 'can', 'name', 'almost', 'character', 'FMA', 'something', ""'m"", 'very', 'forgetful', 'names', 'simply', 'character', 'something', 'endearing', 'bit-players', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'simply', 'fill', 'moment', 'series', 'progress', 'specific', 'scene', 'ahead.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'started', 'collecting', 'FMA', 'yet', 'then', 'start', 'quickly', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'anime', 'out', 'right', 'now', 'can', 'top', 'FMA', 'everything', 'great', 'anime', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'characters', 'great', 'music', 'great', 'animation', 'may', 'be', 'cliche', 'say', 'FMA', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'anime', 'ever', 'created', 'fan', 'anime', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'let', 'slip']","Fullmetal Alchemist: Vol. 6, Episodes 21-24"

925714,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B000AARKY4,Sesho,"[6, 6]","As Edward works his way even deeper into the 5th laboratory, he comes closer to a moral decision that could put him onto the road of darkness forever. Knowing that the creation of the Philosopher's Stone needs the death of human victims, he will have to wrestle with whether restoring Al and himself back to normal is worth the cost of innocent lives, well, actually, criminals. And Al is even questioning whether he is really himself or whether he is just Ed's memories instead of a soul. All the villains of the show are also converging on the site. The Homunculi are there for a reason and want something from Ed, while Scar is there to kill all of them in the name of his god.Fullmetal Alchemist just keeps getting better and better. While it is heavy on action, the moral issues are pretty prominent. The fact that Ed faces conflict on whether to sacrifice the lives of prisoners for Al just shows how realistic Fullmetal is. Scar is a good anti-hero. While he has done some horrible things and engaged in wanton killing, we see what is driving him, and he has begun to evolve in the past two volumes, becoming more enlightened about the fate of his race, and the hearts of Ed and Al. It even gets a little disturbing because most of the characters, even the bad ones, are just trying to make their lives better. The problem is that you don't get something for nothing. And sometimes that cost is death.

In terms of plotline, it would seem fitting that there would have to be problems for Ed and Al in lab five. Thats the conflict isn't it? Without a conflict there's no point in writing a story, unless you like stories like that: where there are little or no conflicts and/or the characters don't die or get hurt. Personally, those are not for me. I apologize to the ""Mixed Feelings"" reviewer, but when you ask questions like that its like asking ""why does this story have conflict?""In all I really like this series. It has twists, turns and its really unpredictable. When a story is unpredictable, you know its been done well. And the characters are full of life and heart, you can actually feel their feelings as they fight all these enemies who are greedy and want to steal everything the Elrics have and received by accident.I've only seen a few of these episodes on TV, but so far I give it a thumbs Up!
