What we're hearing and seeing is a genuine artist soaring once again to heights unfathomable. Every song, every step, every word of dialogue is a gem. If you love Liza, you'll want this one.

I have been a Liza fan ever since ""Flora The Red Menace,""and have seen her in concert a number of times in New York and Boston.But, this DVD is a major disappointment. Liza can still belt in her lower register, and she is extremely likeable. I enjoyed songs such as ""Judy at The Palace."" But, Liza's voice is in tatters, yet she's singing songs that are far outside her current vocal range.Unlike Rosemary Clooney and Tony Bennett, who with age discovered ways to adjust theirvocal styles or give more time to the orchestra, this concert could have been given thirty years ago -- just add the Thompson songs. The Kay Thompson long medley is a highlight because the backup singers are first rate, and that's what is required for such superb arrangements.While some non-Liza's fans may enjoy this DVD, it's really aimed at people who like everything she does regardless of the quality of her voice. This does not apply if you are a Kay Thompson fan.

1296834,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002WHQ9XG,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","Her high notes and vocal range left her a long time ago, but Liza Minnelli was never really about the strength or purity in her singing voice. She has always been about performing all out. In her increasingly rare film roles, her need to bowl us over could get overwhelming, but onstage, it is truly a level of showmanship that she has singularly crafted with blood, sweat and tears over the years thanks in no small part to her lineage. There are moments in this production - especially during the first half - when the 63-year-old entertainer evokes her mother Judy Garland in stage manner and professional savvy. However, Minnelli has truly become her own self-defined persona, one that feeds off an audience's unabated adoration. She gets that in spades in the Hollywood Theatre at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, where her month-long engagement at Broadway's Palace Theater nearly a year earlier was recreated on September 30 and October 1, 2009.Directed and choreographed by Ron Lewis, the almost two-hour running time of this concert is divided into two acts. Minnelli opens the show with a surprisingly sonorous turn on the Gene DePaul-Sammy Cahn classic ""Teach Me Tonight"" and then lights into equally unexpected choices like the comical rat-a-tat-tat of ""If You Hadn't, But You Didn't"" (based on her own self-professed misfortune at love) and an affecting rendition of the Ebb-Kander chestnut, ""My Own Best Friend"". However, she doesn't disappoint fans by including two numbers fromCabaret: a torchy version of ""Maybe This Time"" and a high-octane performance of the title tune. The high point comes with a revised version of the vaudeville tribute her mother performed at the Palace during her legendary engagement back in 1961 (Judy At Carnegie Hall). The second act opens with one of my favorites, the resigned-to-blistering ""And the World Goes `Round"" fromNew York, New York.What follows is an extensive recreation of the nightclub act that her godmother Kay Thompson performed in the late 1940's with the Williams brothers as her back-up quartet. Thompson was a legendary vocal arranger from MGM's golden era, probably best remembered for her scene-stealing turn as the flamboyant fashion editor in Stanley Donen'sFunny Face. Granted Minnelli more struts than dances, she is still at her energetic best in these up-tempo numbers backed by an accommodating quartet of talented singer-dancers: Cortes Alexander, Jim Caruso, Tiger Martina, and Johnny Rodgers. Naturally, she climaxes the show with a no-holds-barred rendition of her signature tune, ""New York, New York"", followed by a quiet encore, another tribute to her mother, ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" accompanied solely by Billy Stritch's piano. Despite the ragged edges of her performance, Minnelli proves she can still wow them. The one extra to the 2010 DVD is an extended conversation between Minnelli and Lewis about the creation of the concert.",4,Liza Defies the Odds Yet Again with a Full-Throttle Performance,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,2927,"['high', 'notes', 'vocal', 'range', 'left', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'strength', 'purity', 'singing', 'voice', 'always', 'been', 'performing', 'out', 'increasingly', 'rare', 'film', 'roles', 'need', 'bowl', 'over', 'could', 'get', 'overwhelming', 'onstage', 'truly', 'level', 'showmanship', 'singularly', 'crafted', 'blood', 'sweat', 'tears', 'years', 'thanks', 'small', 'part', 'lineage', 'are', 'moments', 'production', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'when', '63-year-old', 'entertainer', 'mother', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'stage', 'manner', 'professional', 'savvy', 'However', 'Minnelli', 'truly', 'become', 'own', 'self-defined', 'persona', 'one', 'audience', 'unabated', 'adoration', 'spades', 'Hollywood', 'Theatre', 'MGM', 'Grand', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'where', 'month-long', 'engagement', 'Broadway', 'Palace', 'Theater', 'nearly', 'year', 'earlier', 'was', 'recreated', 'September', '30', 'October', '1', '2009.Directed', 'choreographed', 'Ron', 'Lewis', 'almost', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'concert', 'divided', 'two', 'acts', 'Minnelli', 'show', 'surprisingly', 'sonorous', 'turn', 'Gene', 'DePaul-Sammy', 'Cahn', 'classic', 'Teach', 'Me', 'Tonight', 'then', 'lights', 'equally', 'unexpected', 'choices', 'comical', 'rat-a-tat-tat', 'Had', ""n't"", 'Did', ""n't"", 'based', 'own', 'self-professed', 'misfortune', 'love', 'affecting', 'rendition', 'Ebb-Kander', 'chestnut', 'Own', 'Best', 'Friend', 'However', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'fans', 'including', 'two', 'numbers', 'fromCabaret', 'torchy', 'version', 'Maybe', 'Time', 'high-octane', 'performance', 'title', 'tune', 'high', 'point', 'revised', 'version', 'vaudeville', 'mother', 'performed', 'Palace', 'legendary', 'engagement', 'back', '1961', 'Judy', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'second', 'act', 'one', 'favorites', 'resigned-to-blistering', 'World', 'Goes', 'Round', 'fromNew', 'York', 'New', 'York.What', 'extensive', 'recreation', 'nightclub', 'act', 'godmother', 'Kay', 'Thompson', 'performed', 'late', '1940', 'Williams', 'brothers', 'back-up', 'quartet', 'Thompson', 'was', 'legendary', 'vocal', 'arranger', 'MGM', 'golden', 'era', 'probably', 'best', 'remembered', 'scene-stealing', 'turn', 'flamboyant', 'fashion', 'editor', 'Stanley', ""Donen'sFunny"", 'Face', 'Granted', 'Minnelli', 'more', 'struts', 'dances', 'still', 'energetic', 'best', 'up-tempo', 'numbers', 'backed', 'accommodating', 'quartet', 'talented', 'singer-dancers', 'Cortes', 'Alexander', 'Jim', 'Caruso', 'Tiger', 'Martina', 'Johnny', 'Rodgers', 'Naturally', 'climaxes', 'show', 'no-holds-barred', 'rendition', 'signature', 'tune', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'followed', 'quiet', 'encore', 'tribute', 'mother', 'Have', 'Merry', 'Little', 'Christmas', 'accompanied', 'solely', 'Billy', 'Stritch', 'piano', 'ragged', 'edges', 'performance', 'Minnelli', 'can', 'still', 'wow', 'one', 'extra', '2010', 'DVD', 'extended', 'conversation', 'Minnelli', 'Lewis', 'creation', 'concert']",N/A

In the first half she was happy to sit down and singone of her songs, ""MAYBE THIS TIME,"" and sitting or standing she gives it her all. Realizing thechanges in her  voice for numerous reasons she has become a ""performer,"" and ""actress,"" who I whouldlove to see on screen more. She might have sat in Act one but she never sat down in Act 2 and her tributeto godmother ""Kay Thompon"" was out of this world. It could have gone the other way for none of the songshave gone on to become popular.I hope that Liza watches this tape over and over again, realizing one of the key elements of making thisspecial was the sincerity of her stories and memories. In fact I would have loved more stories...morememories...and I hope Liza does that from this point on. I want to hear her views of growing up in sucha multi talented, troubled family life. I'm not seeking stories but I'm lovin to hear the special memoriesthat translates to the audience, as her mom is ""Judy Garland,"" and father, ""Vincente Minnelli.""It allows her concerts to become partly a play, an autobiography of what  she remembers.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect now that Liza's getting older--but I came away far from being disappointed. I've seen MANY Liza concerts; and this one is easily one of her very, very best. At her age she manages to electrify her adoring audience; her delivery of each and every song proves she has a tremendous command of anything that comes her way.There's nothing bad I can say about this concert! Liza gave blood and it shows. Just watch the way she moves, the way she enunciates, her sophisticated phrasing and her timing. It's all flawless. They say she worked hard for this and I'm sure that she did; but she makes it all look so easy--I don't know how she does it. The years clearly haven't diminished her ability to entertain us one bit; and that's grand.There are many songs in this concert; and all of them are worthy of mention. Of course, I still had my personal favorites. Liza dazzled me with ""Teach Me Tonight;"" ""If You Hadn't, But You Did;"" ""What Makes a Man a Man;"" ""My Own Best Friend;"" ""Maybe This Time;"" ""The Palace Medley"" which makes a wonderful tribute to her mother, Judy Garland; ""Cabaret;"" ""And the World Goes `Round;"" ""Basin Street Blues;"" Clap Yo' Hands;"" ""Liza (All the Clouds`ll Roll Away);"" ""Look For the Silver Lining;"" ""New York, New York"" and her encore number, ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.""

I was one of those shocked years back when she came out as the grand finale at the tribute to Freddie Mercury...I thought even then she was passe and ultimately understood it as a ""gay"" thing for Freddie that the remaining members of Queen supported.I may have even thought I may be witnessing a train wreck when I picked up this disc, but when I put it in my player....Unlike some of the other reviews I'm not going to discuss her vocal range and timber...although I have many years in the music business and have produced nearly 100 albums. I would like to stress the ""entertainment"" factor which I find to be off the chart on this project and I found her performance galvanizing!!!The production values are thankfully first class but its the sheer power and electricity of her performance that put this over the top and make me glad I picked it up. The ultimate compliment I can make where any live/performance DVD is concerned is that it makes me sad I didn't go see the actual tour of the artist and I absolutely would have enjoyed this night.  Even though I am not familiar with much of the material she performs ,it didn't really matter, which again just shows how compelling she is. Sometimes vocalists with great gifts fall back on their perfect instrument and don't really engage the audience and sometimes an artist whose instrument isn't what it used to be chooses to dial up the energy to compensate and that might be what we have...but she sings the (you know what) out of every tune and between songs uses her charm and acting chops to keep the audience riveted.Any fan of hers I would imagine should love this and those who wish to nitpick about her upper register probably can't see the forest for the trees!",5,"this  gal can ""bring it"" as they say.....kudos to Liza !!!!",1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,1844,"['picked', 'up', 'today', 'not', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'never', 'seeing', 'live', 'always', 'enjoying', 'style', 'performer', 'was', 'one', 'shocked', 'years', 'back', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'grand', 'finale', 'tribute', 'Freddie', 'Mercury', 'thought', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'passe', 'ultimately', 'understood', 'gay', 'thing', 'Freddie', 'remaining', 'members', 'Queen', 'supported.I', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'thought', 'may', 'be', 'witnessing', 'train', 'wreck', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'disc', 'when', 'put', 'player', 'other', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'discuss', 'vocal', 'range', 'timber', 'have', 'many', 'years', 'music', 'business', 'have', 'produced', 'nearly', '100', 'albums', 'would', 'like', 'stress', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'find', 'be', 'off', 'chart', 'project', 'found', 'performance', 'galvanizing', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'thankfully', 'first', 'class', 'sheer', 'power', 'electricity', 'performance', 'put', 'top', 'make', 'glad', 'picked', 'up', 'ultimate', 'compliment', 'can', 'make', 'where', 'live/performance', 'DVD', 'concerned', 'sad', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'actual', 'tour', 'artist', 'absolutely', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'night', 'Even', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'much', 'material', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'again', 'just', 'how', 'compelling', 'Sometimes', 'great', 'gifts', 'fall', 'back', 'perfect', 'instrument', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'engage', 'audience', 'sometimes', 'artist', 'instrument', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'be', 'chooses', 'dial', 'up', 'energy', 'compensate', 'might', 'be', 'what', 'have', 'know', 'what', 'tune', 'songs', 'charm', 'acting', 'chops', 'keep', 'audience', 'riveted.Any', 'fan', 'hers', 'would', 'imagine', 'should', 'love', 'who', 'wish', 'nitpick', 'upper', 'register', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'forest', 'trees']",N/A

For many - they would prefer to remember her the way they may have seen her years ago - when she was at her peak. When this DVD was recorded I had already bought my tickets to her concert in Sydney last October - and having seen a little of what she performs like now on Youtube - i kind of knew what i was in for. For those who don't know... Liza doesn't perform the way she used to. She can still belt out songs to some degree - but not the way she did years ago. Her voice still sounds like her - but its not the same Liza. She's more frail - she gets very worn out easily - in part because she gives every song and every moment on stage everything she has within her to give.And also, in part because her system is so clearly wrecked from the years of substance abuse and health problems. The amount of face-lifts are also very obvious. Yet these days - audiences the world over - give her standing ovation after standing ovation for the great performer she still shows us a faint glimmer of now.The first half of this show is a selection of songs she is known for - which always make the crowd go wild, as well as a few character pieces that she has added - one of which really is hard to listen to - cause her diction is not as good anymore (referring to 'If You Hadn't, But You Did). Nice in concert to hear the little anecdotes here and there.The second half of the show is a tribute to her late godmother Kay Thompson - one of America's great cabaret performers, and in particular during her time and shows with The Williams Brothers (one of which was Andy Williams).There is no footage that survives to this day of Thompsons original shows or choreography - just still photographs. It's entertaining for the most part - as it's not a serious tribute - it's entertainment - and for this i must say it's great to see.By the end of the show - she's buggered. the final number - New York, New York, she barely makes it through. But she gives it every damn ounce of energy she can possibly muster up in her being and performs the hell out of it.Nice to have a concert DVD of Liza in a few different stages of her career and her performing life.

The concert is divided into two parts: the first features music made famous by Liza herself including ""Cabaret"" as well as songs made famous by her mother Judy Garland when she did vaudeville; the second part is dedicated to Liza's Godmother Kay Thompson, an amazing performer who taught song and dance at MGM in the '30's and '40's. Liza Minnelli is now 64 years of age and if your expecting the Liza who use to strut across the stage impeccably you will be disappointed. Her voice is not up to par either. These were factors many Broadway critics pointed out in their reviews of this show. However, this is the one and only Liza and she does her best and it shows. She belts out tunes and dances to the best of her ability. Liza gives this performance her all and that is all we as an audience can ask from any entertainer.

Minnelli recreated her Broadway show in a midnight performance at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on October 1, 2009.  The concert features songs written by George and Ira Gershwin, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Sammy Cahn, and the team most closely associated with Minnelli, John Kander and Fred Ebb, composers of ""Cabaret,"" ""Maybe This Time,"" ""But the World Goes `Round,"" and ""New York, New York.""It also includes two special tributes: to Liza's mother, Judy Garland, via a performance of Garland's own 1951 Palace theater tribute to vaudeville; and to Liza's godmother, Kay Thompson, a singer-dancer, songwriter, and vocal arranger/coach at MGM in the 1940's. For the tribute to Thompson, Minnelli is joined by a male singing and dancing quartet who stand in for the Williams Brothers (who included a young Andy Williams), the group that backed Thompson in her cabaret act of the late 1940's and early 1950's.Liza Minnelli won the Best Actress Oscar for ""Cabaret"" in 1972, the same year she won an Emmy for the Bob Fosse-directed TV special, ""Liza With a Z.""  Her movies include ""The Sterile Cuckoo,"" Martin Scorsese's ""New York, New York,"" and the comedy hit ""Arthur.""  In ""Liza's at the Palace,"" her energy level is 100% and her joy of performing apparent in every moment as she feeds off the audience's enthusiasm and adulation.
