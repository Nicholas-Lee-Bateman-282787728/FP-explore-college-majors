1534860,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B007NE02MM,Jason,"[1, 1]","The backdrop: A Vietnam veteran gets confronted on a bus, doesn't back down when antagonized, and proceeds to repaint several seats with blood from the nose of his aggressor.  The video goes to Youtube where it immediately goes viral.  He's immediately nicknamed ""Epic Beard Man.""  Following days provide us with a Street Fighter II remake, an interview or two, a documentary, the discovery that the protagonist has had issues in the past, the revelation that the antagonist was intoxicated and butted his nose in where it didn't belong, and the person behind the video took a ton of grief for instigating a fight and perceived racism.  Playing off that internet fame we get Bad Ass.First of all, the film is based VERY loosely on the actual events and the actual man.  The original altercation was a elderly white guy beating up a younger black guy, and the movie starts out with Trejo beating two white skinhead while defending an elderly black man.  Beyond that, I'm 100% positive the original Epic Beard Man did not unleash his inner Bernhard Goetz and has not gone on to a life of vigilante justice.  Nonetheless, Danny Trejo embraces that role and literally kicks ass the entire movie.The storyline is utterly predictable, but I didn't care.  The acting - supporting actor Charles S. Dutton - was pretty good all around.  The attempts at humor that often get forced into action films like this were almost all poorly done.  I would much rather have just seen another fight instead of a corny scene full of unfunny interaction.  And the love interest?  C'mon!  Chicks may dig real-life Danny Trejo, but they would almost unequivocally not be into a broke, disabled, nasty beard, movie version of Danny Trejo.  While the scenes in Machete worked because of the nature of the film, they do not work as well in this movie.Most impressive about this film is Trejo's action chops.  Much like in Machete, he spreads his wings and shows he can move pretty well.  A bit of the blood spray and slow-mo work was hokey, but for the most part the action holds up well.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, and he looks like he might actually be a BAMF...like Epic Beard Man.",5,DEATH WISH TREJO,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,2157,"['backdrop', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'confronted', 'bus', ""n't"", 'back', 'down', 'when', 'antagonized', 'proceeds', 'repaint', 'several', 'seats', 'blood', 'nose', 'aggressor', 'video', 'Youtube', 'where', 'immediately', 'viral', 'immediately', 'nicknamed', 'Epic', 'Beard', 'Man', 'Following', 'days', 'provide', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'II', 'remake', 'interview', 'two', 'documentary', 'discovery', 'protagonist', 'had', 'issues', 'past', 'revelation', 'antagonist', 'was', 'intoxicated', 'butted', 'nose', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'person', 'video', 'took', 'ton', 'grief', 'instigating', 'fight', 'perceived', 'racism', 'Playing', 'off', 'internet', 'fame', 'get', 'Bad', 'Ass.First', 'film', 'based', 'VERY', 'loosely', 'actual', 'events', 'actual', 'man', 'original', 'altercation', 'was', 'elderly', 'white', 'guy', 'beating', 'up', 'younger', 'black', 'guy', 'movie', 'out', 'Trejo', 'beating', 'two', 'white', 'skinhead', 'defending', 'elderly', 'black', 'man', 'Beyond', ""'m"", '100', '%', 'positive', 'original', 'Epic', 'Beard', 'Man', 'did', 'not', 'unleash', 'inner', 'Bernhard', 'Goetz', 'not', 'gone', 'life', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'Nonetheless', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'role', 'literally', 'kicks', 'ass', 'entire', 'movie.The', 'storyline', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'acting', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'around', 'attempts', 'humor', 'often', 'get', 'forced', 'action', 'films', 'were', 'almost', 'poorly', 'done', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'fight', 'instead', 'corny', 'scene', 'full', 'unfunny', 'interaction', 'love', 'interest', ""C'mon"", 'Chicks', 'may', 'dig', 'real-life', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'would', 'almost', 'unequivocally', 'not', 'be', 'broke', 'disabled', 'nasty', 'beard', 'movie', 'version', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'scenes', 'Machete', 'worked', 'nature', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'movie.Most', 'impressive', 'film', 'Trejo', 'action', 'chops', 'Much', 'Machete', 'wings', 'can', 'move', 'pretty', 'well', 'bit', 'blood', 'spray', 'slow-mo', 'work', 'was', 'hokey', 'most', 'part', 'action', 'up', 'well', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bit', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'BAMF', 'Epic', 'Beard', 'Man']",N/A

For the Vietnam veterans, post-war is one of the biggest battles of all. Decorated war hero, Frank Vega, is no stranger to this. Upon returning home he learns that fitting in is no easy task. After being shunned by society and his childhood sweetheart, he is left to fend for himself. Forty years later and no longer the young dreamer he once was, a deplorable incident on a bus brings him back into the spotlight. But it isn't until his best friend is murdered that he begins the unyielding fight for justice that turns him into the Bad Ass.I have a confession... Danny Trejo is the sole reason I watched this movie. We have that type of relationship where if he's in it, I'll watch it. Because c'mon... he's a bad ass! And speaking of Bad Ass, if you hadn't already guessed by the no-holds-barred-title, this is a movie I lovingly classify ""awesomely bad."" So yeah, that should say a lot right there. It's a shame, really, that Trejo's not one of the more well-known action stars of today because he genuinely is a total BAD ASS. I mean, he's no spring chicken and he's still got some seriously impressive moves. I kind of adore him despite his choice in doing awesomely bad and just plain bad movies.Bad Ass is one of those vigilante justice titles much like Grand Torino or The Brave One. I guess the biggest difference is that it takes on a more casual tone and lacks the depth and insight that most movies of this genre do. And it's not to say that Bad Ass is bad necessarily, it definitely makes a point, only it does so with a little less finesse than the others. And I have to give them credit because there's only so much that ass-kicking can make up for when you're working with a subpar screenplay.One of the prerequisites for obtaining my seal of ""awesomely badness"" is that a movie must NOT take itself too seriously. So yeah, Bad Ass definitely doesn't. In fact, there are enough well-timed quips of comedy to make it enjoyable and tone down on the seriousness. It's also notable to mention that the comedy here outshines many of the cliched puns used in action flicks today. They might not be smart but they're original. Bad Ass has a good mix of action, comedy and drama so it never gets stale. And yes, I don't deny that there is a bit of the cheese factor to the movie, however, it's got a decent message at it's core so I'm willing to overlook all that.

And if you're into those kinds of movies, you should enjoy this one. And with a tagline ""They 'messed' with the wrong senior citizen"", how can you go wrong? Personally, I'm a big Danny Trejo fan. And its nice to see him play in more starring roles (like Machete). And this role fits him perfectly. The film has plenty of action, some amusing lines of dialogue, and actually a pretty good storyline. In fact, its partly based on a true event of an older man beating a younger guy up on a bus (which is how the film begins). The acting is decent, and the only kinda weak thing is some of the special effects look very obvious. Other than that, I can't complain to much about the film. I definitely enjoyed it. You have to know what kind of film you're watching in order to have the right expectations. Obviously, if you bought or rent this expecting something like Training Day or something other more dramatic action film, then you're gonna be disappointed.

I have to start by saying that only Danny Trejo could play this part, it is so perfect for him. Perfect blend of over the top action and comedy and realistic action that only he can pull off. That said this is really nothing original combining parts of ""Falling Down"", ""Gran Torino"" and ""Hobo With A Shotgun"" but what the movie is is very entertaining. There are some movies that suck you in with a story and keep you interested and guessing.

One day Frank protects an elderly citizen from two unruly young men by beating them up.That Frank becomes a sort of local hero has little to do with the rest of the film, which is mainly about Frank's quest for the person responsible for the death of his best friend Klondike (Harrison Page). The story is that of a typical B action movie, in which one clue leads to another, until a corrupt public figure and a few henchmen hired by him show up.Don't expect violent action here. This is not a so-called ""vigilante film"" like ""Hobo with a Shotgun."" ""Bad Ass"" is more like an old-fashioned low-budget action flick, with a romantic subplot (yes, romance) about Frank's budding relationship with his next-door neighbor Amber (Joyful Drake), mother of a precocious son. And of course it is Frank who saves her from her abusive husband.With charismatic Danny Trejo in the starring role, ""Bad Ass"" remains pretty entertaining throughout, but it is obvious the film could have been much better with a more focused story and sharper direction.
