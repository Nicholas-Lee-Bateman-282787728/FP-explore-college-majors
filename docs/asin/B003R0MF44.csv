1359910,AKZGOBZGR1WA3,B003R0MF44,A.K.A. Me,"[77, 81]","Season One of Human Target was a little choppy in the beginning. I've always been a big fan of both Mark Valley and Jackie Earle Haley, so I kept watching, and I was REALLY glad I did. The show really started to gel beautifully in the last third of the season, when they started to incorporate more of Haley's character, Guerrero, and toned down the animosity between him and Chi McBride's character, Winston. Later, this particular dynamic became much less serious, and more of a tug-of than an actual war. By the end of the first season I was completely hooked. I LOVE my USA network shows, Memphis Beat and Leverage, but this became my favorite. Could NOT wait for the second season. The show received three Emmy nominations and developed a VERY loyal following.When, at the end of the first season it was announced that two women were going to join the cast I was skeptical. Most of my favorite shows have strong women characters, but this just didn't strike me as the right vehicle. It was just so perfect as it was. When the characters were revealed, I was NOT happy, and neither were MOST of the fans, from what I can gather. A green young woman with an attitude problem and a lack of commitment? A ""hands-off"" investor who decides to meddle, change all the guys and the way they do things in a whiny, self righteous manner? In real life, these women would get these guys KILLED. BAD MOVE. And when they made Guerrero into a babysitter, I thought it was all over. BUT luckily that little plot line faded out, and still the magic of Chance, Winston and Guerrero pulled this show through.So the question is (as it pretty much ALWAYS is...) Why can't Fox let a show develop without screwing with it? This show was PERFECT at the end of the first season. They take it in a BAD direction, they delay the start of the second season, they change the night, pre-empt it, change the time to make it follow American Idol (Dude...really?) and then they're not happy with the results, DESPITE the fact that their loyal fans followed it through EVERY combination and permutation. Should watching your favorite show be an obstacle course???And still, now, they can't decide whether or not to renew this show. After the fiasco of Terriers on F/X, I will NEVER get caught up in a Fox show again if they cancel Human Target. It's just too painful to have your favorite shows pulled right out from under you, Emmy nominations and loyal fans not withstanding.I highly recommend this show on DVD to anyone who enjoys the new action/drama/smattering of comedy vehicles, such as Burn Notice and Leverage. GREAT chemistry between the original cast members, and stories you WON'T figure out, even if you are cursed with ""can always figure out the ending-itis.""",5,Some things just shouldn't be Co-ed,1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,2743,"['Season', 'One', 'Human', 'Target', 'was', 'little', 'choppy', 'beginning', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Mark', 'Valley', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'kept', 'watching', 'was', 'REALLY', 'glad', 'did', 'show', 'really', 'started', 'gel', 'beautifully', 'last', 'third', 'season', 'when', 'started', 'incorporate', 'more', 'Haley', 'character', 'Guerrero', 'toned', 'down', 'animosity', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'character', 'Winston', 'Later', 'particular', 'dynamic', 'became', 'much', 'less', 'serious', 'more', 'tug-of', 'actual', 'war', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'completely', 'hooked', 'LOVE', 'USA', 'network', 'shows', 'Memphis', 'Beat', 'Leverage', 'became', 'favorite', 'Could', 'NOT', 'wait', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'received', 'three', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'developed', 'VERY', 'loyal', 'following.When', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'announced', 'two', 'women', 'were', 'going', 'join', 'cast', 'was', 'skeptical', 'Most', 'favorite', 'shows', 'have', 'strong', 'women', 'characters', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'right', 'vehicle', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'perfect', 'was', 'When', 'characters', 'were', 'revealed', 'was', 'NOT', 'happy', 'were', 'MOST', 'fans', 'what', 'can', 'gather', 'green', 'young', 'woman', 'attitude', 'problem', 'lack', 'commitment', 'hands-off', 'investor', 'who', 'meddle', 'change', 'guys', 'way', 'do', 'things', 'whiny', 'righteous', 'manner', 'real', 'life', 'women', 'would', 'get', 'guys', 'KILLED', 'BAD', 'MOVE', 'when', 'made', 'Guerrero', 'babysitter', 'thought', 'was', 'BUT', 'luckily', 'that', 'little', 'plot', 'line', 'faded', 'out', 'still', 'magic', 'Chance', 'Winston', 'Guerrero', 'pulled', 'show', 'question', 'pretty', 'much', 'ALWAYS', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Fox', 'let', 'show', 'develop', 'screwing', 'show', 'was', 'PERFECT', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'take', 'BAD', 'direction', 'delay', 'start', 'second', 'season', 'change', 'night', 'pre-empt', 'change', 'time', 'make', 'follow', 'American', 'Idol', 'Dude', 'really', 'then', ""'re"", 'not', 'happy', 'results', 'DESPITE', 'fact', 'loyal', 'fans', 'followed', 'EVERY', 'combination', 'permutation', 'Should', 'watching', 'favorite', 'show', 'be', 'obstacle', 'course', 'still', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'not', 'renew', 'show', 'fiasco', 'Terriers', 'F/X', 'will', 'NEVER', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'Fox', 'show', 'again', 'cancel', 'Human', 'Target', 'just', 'too', 'painful', 'have', 'favorite', 'shows', 'pulled', 'right', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'loyal', 'fans', 'not', 'withstanding.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'new', 'action/drama/smattering', 'comedy', 'vehicles', 'such', 'Burn', 'Notice', 'Leverage', 'GREAT', 'chemistry', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'stories', 'WO', ""N'T"", 'figure', 'out', 'even', 'are', 'cursed', 'can', 'always', 'figure', 'out', 'ending-itis']",Human Target: Season 2

This is not the type of series that lends itself to such a treatment.  I felt bad for the characters and the actors for the entire episode.  If you like Human Target, do yourself a favor and skip this episode.  It does nothing to advance the storyline.  It has horrible music throughout, albeit on purpose.  The father of the suburban family is so annoying that you hope he dies.  In fact, the whole family is pretty irritating.  Chi McBride in a santa costume should never, ever have happened.  Not that it mattered in this train wreck, but the plot made absolutely no sense, and the fight scenes were poorly filmed and fakey, not like the usual fight scenes.  This was the worst episode of any TV series ever.  I hope they can all recover from this ordeal.  I enjoy this series, even though it not my favorite.  (Dexter.)

Loved Mark Valley and Chi McBride, all of the actors in season one. I really feel the addition of the female thief and the female financier ruined the show. Can't I have at least one show that isn't about shoving romance down my throat? The preoccupation with sex in TV shows is ridiculous, and a cop out. What made Season 1 great was the cases and characters, not romance or sexual tension. Stick with the great writing.

The super spy that's not a spy like the man with no name. Saving the people that hire him and his great cast. He is like James Bond with a fun child attitude. Tough as they come and a real human being at the same time. Chi McBride as the ex-cop that is smart and wanted to make more of a difference acts as the head of the agency. Jackie Earle Harley is priceless as the little guy with a reputation for toughness that makes the baddest of the bad tremble in fear.
