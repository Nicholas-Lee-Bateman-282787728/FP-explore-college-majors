974333,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000EMGICS,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[0, 2]","Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) flies cross country with her finance', Jeff (Mark Ruffalo), to be at her sister's wedding.  She narrates all her apprehension as she reflects that she has little in common with her wealthy Pasadena family.  Interlaced are scenes for the alleged inspiration of the movie, 'The Graduate,' and the key triangle romance between Dustin Hoffman's character, the mother and the daughter.  She believes she is the product of its inspiration.  This sets us up for a playful backdrop for the plot of 'Rumor Has It...'When she arrives all of her goofy alienation comes to haunt her, but it is during the wedding reception that she hears some suggestive information:  Her mother had an affair just before her wedding, and, doing some math, she calculates that her misfit status may be hereditary.  Her father may have been her mother's lover on a trist in Mexico just before she married.  Grandma Catherine (Shirley MacClaine) has all the low-down.  She has the year book that shows a picture of Class of '59 ladies' man, Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner), her mother's fling thing before marriage.  Most of the film sets up the funny investigation as she meets her mother's lover.  (She passed away neatly enough when Sarah was nine, so Beau is her only recourse.)  We get mixed messages, but Sarah is taken on flight, romantically and literally, by this jet-set philanderer.  The answers do come about with a telling confrontation between Grandma are 'her' ex-lover, Beau!  Then, one of the best scenes is saved between father and daughter.  Showing beautiful tenderness, Jennifer Anniston proves that she's an actress who can, as in can be more than a skillful hair-brained comic screen presence.Shirley MacClaine is always welcome.  This time she dials it up two notches as an even more abrasive part than her classic Aurora Greenway role in 'Terms of Endearment'.  Bluntly crude, Grandma Catherine is blurt-out funny as are many of the lines delivered in this warmly engaging adult comedy.  Kevin Costner takes a stepping stone to his comeback with his low-key, yet suave performance as Beau.  (Although I think he is even better in his latest adventure 'The Guardian'.)  The treatment of possible incest and infidelity during engagement is given both sensitive and comedic treatment.  Often cutesy, but never banal, 'Rumor Has It...' is a rejuvenating film.  Rob Reiner, as usual, delivers a heartwarming comedic hand, and it is to his credit that the world often seems like a  better place after watching another one of his movies.

Well it was recently on my premium movie channel and I started watching it. It begins with Sara (Jennifer Aniston) heading with her boyfriend/fiancee to her younger sister's weddding. Once there she gets involved in a 'rumor' about her family and finds out her deceased mom and very much alive grandmother slept with the same guy and they made a movie about it: The Graduate! Now she becomes obsessed with finding this guy. She goes and finds him and a romance ensues (onces she's sure he's not her dad, I'll admit that part was kind of weird.) It goes on from there. I won't ruin the ending, but it was a bit anti-climatic. I can see why Jennifer Aniston is trying to disown this one, but it's a decent rental.

974335,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000EMGICS,A Customer,"[2, 3]","Another sit-com type, light-hearted, and feel good movie that got ravaged by the critics when it was released in the theatres. Rumor Has It isn't all bad, in fact, largely due to the performances of the A-list cast members, it's a pleasant little screwball comedy occasionally peppered with some clever dialogue. Although the movie's denouement doesn't really live up to the promise of it's opening, there's lots of fun to be had and there's something intrinsically likeable about all the characters.Sarah Huttinger (Jennifer Aniston) and her boyfriend Jeff (Mark Ruffalo) are on their way to her ditzy younger sister's wedding in Pasadena. Sarah and Jeff also plan to get married, but of late, a feeling of insecurity has been plaguing Sarah. Her initial diffidence is reinforced when she learns that members of her family were the inspiration for the book and 1967 film, The Graduate - and she just might be the offspring of the liaison.Jeff is initially weary of Sarah's investigations, but when he discovers there's a huge question revolving around the date of her birth, Sarah is compelled to seek out the truth.  Was her Granny Catherine (Shirley MacLaine) in fact Mrs. Robinson? And was that Benjamin Braddock, so famously played by Dustin Hoffman, in fact an entrepreneurial Internet shark called Beau Burroughs, played by Kevin Costner?It's all terribly far fetched and the material is undoubtedly light-weight, contrived and rather predictable, but director Rob Reiner imbues his characters with such a fine sense of loving earnestness that it is impossible not to get caught up in all the shenanigans of the Huttinger family. Shirley MacLaine gets the best lines as sharp-witted, cynical and world-weary Catherine who tosses alcohol fuelled acerbic barbs at the drop of a hat.By the time Sarah wakes up at a seaside villa in San Francisco not knowing where she is, perhaps enamored of her new potential father, we know we have been kidnapped by the fantasy. And as the main story begins to wear out steam, Reiner beefs up the screenplay, with subplot of Sarah's neurotic sister, Annie (Mena Suvari) and then introduces a zany character (Cathy Bates), who was around at the time and knows a few secrets.It's thanks to the charisma of Aniston, Ruffalo and Kevin Costner as the aging Romeo, the smooth-talking classic charmer that the movie mostly works. Ruffalo - who is always good - manages to bring some of his ineffable charm to the role of Jeff, and Aniston, who has the central role of the tortured, conflicted, self doubting and generally messed up 20-something trying to find herself, is her usual competent and quirky self.I guess you could wrap up Rumor Has It by saying it's a film with a meagerly clad premise that works as a type of cheery and optimistic farce, but don't expect anything that rises above mediocrity.

I love Director Rob Reiner as well, he has directed some great films, like Stand by me, When harry met sally, and The story of us, but this film was slow and not funny at all. Shirley McClaine holds this film together but her jokes are kind of vulgar and strange. I wanted to like this film, the trailer was deceiving, it looked like a comedy but it is mainly a drama.

974337,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B000EMGICS,Amanda Richards,"[3, 6]","This is a slightly above-average romantic comedy, but would have been much less so if it weren&#8217;t for the luminescence of the star power assembled by Rob Reiner.Jennifer Aniston plays Sarah Huttinger, a cutesy-pie, ditsy and often confused young woman, who is engaged to a perfect man (Mark Ruffalo) but who is unsure of her feelings towards marriage.  Now living in New York, she and her fianc&eacute; travel to her hometown of Pasadena to attend her sister&#8217;s wedding, and while there, events lead Sarah to the shocking revelation that her family may have inspired the story of &#8220;The Graduate&#8221;, and that the timing of her birth raises a few questions about her biological father.Her mother having passed away when she was nine, Sarah confronts her grandmother (a show-stealing brilliantly cast Shirley MacLaine), and then sets off on a man-hunt for Beau Burroughs (an unbelievably charming and entertaining Kevin Costner), the man who inspired the Benjamin Braddock character.Doing her detective work efficiently, she tracks him to San Francisco, where he puts some of her fears to rest on the one hand, but stirs up a hornet&#8217;s nest with the other.  Her relationship with her fianc&eacute; deteriorates rapidly, but when she is called upon to calm her sister&#8217;s anxieties about marriage, she realizes that she should listen to herself sometimes on matters of the heart.A shaky script that is admirably supported by the cast, but all the kudos belong to Shirley MacLaine who made this movie watchable.Hey hey hey.- 3.5 starsAmanda Richards, June 12, 2006",4,"And here&#8217;s to you, Mrs. Richelieu&#8230;..",1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,1587,"['slightly', 'above-average', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'less', 'so', '8217', 't', 'luminescence', 'star', 'power', 'assembled', 'Rob', 'Reiner.Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Sarah', 'Huttinger', 'cutesy-pie', 'ditsy', 'often', 'confused', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'engaged', 'perfect', 'man', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'unsure', 'feelings', 'towards', 'marriage', 'Now', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'travel', 'hometown', 'Pasadena', 'attend', 'sister', '8217', 'wedding', 'there', 'events', 'lead', 'Sarah', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'family', 'may', 'have', 'inspired', 'story', '8220', 'Graduate', '8221', 'timing', 'birth', 'few', 'questions', 'biological', 'father.Her', 'mother', 'having', 'passed', 'away', 'when', 'was', 'nine', 'Sarah', 'grandmother', 'show-stealing', 'brilliantly', 'cast', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'then', 'off', 'man-hunt', 'Beau', 'Burroughs', 'unbelievably', 'charming', 'entertaining', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'man', 'who', 'inspired', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'character.Doing', 'detective', 'work', 'efficiently', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'fears', 'rest', 'one', 'hand', 'up', 'hornet', '8217', 'nest', 'other', 'relationship', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'rapidly', 'when', 'called', 'calm', 'sister', '8217', 'anxieties', 'marriage', 'should', 'listen', 'sometimes', 'matters', 'heart.A', 'shaky', 'script', 'admirably', 'supported', 'cast', 'kudos', 'belong', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'hey', 'hey.-', '3.5', 'starsAmanda', 'Richards', 'June', '12', '2006']",N/A

974341,ARA48345JZPZR,B000EMGICS,Archmaker,"[2, 2]","I enjoyed the idea that The Graduate, both book and movie, was really a disguised true story of a friend of author Charles Webb's who actually did sleep with an older woman, the infamous Mrs. Robinson, and later fell-in-love and slept with her daughter who then married another.  That the grandaughter of the former and daughter of the latter discovers it might be her family that was being written about and sets out to discover the truth was a clever conceit and might have made a pretty good movie.Unfortunately, this ain't it.  While it has all the elements, including Jennifer Aniston as the young woman, a nicely laid-back Kevin Costner as Beau Burroughs the real-life model for Benjamin Braddock in the book and film, and what should have been an easy homerun for Shirley Maclaine as the prototype for Mrs. Robinson, ends up being flat-footed comically, awkward romantically and just off-kilter in direction, performance and tone.  The comedy is forced and unfunny, the sentimentality and emotion un-earned.I don't know what has happened to Rob Reiner whose early work was marked by such superb manipulation and timing of all these elements of comedy, emotion and sentimentality, but none of it works here.

This is a decent movie, but it's kind of slow and, well, just plain boring some of the time. And some of the time, you might just want to gag at the thought of a girl who sleeps with the same playboy that her mother and grandmother have also slept with. Yuck! I don't care if the playboy is played by Kevin Costner!Aniston plays Sarah, who is engaged to Jeff (Ruffalo) and living in NYC. Sarah has always felt like the oddball of her family. She's not quite blonde. She hates tennis. She has nothing in common with the people of her hometown, Pasadena. Her little sister is getting married, and even though Sarah is happy for her, she still feels out of place. That's when she begins to piece together the biggest mystery of Pasadena: Who exactly was the inspiration for the movie The Graduate? When she discovers that it was HER family, she goes on a wild goose chase to find the real life Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman's character in The Graduate). Turns out, that Benjamin Braddock is actually Beau Burroughs (Costner), and Sarah begins to wonder if there are genetic reasons for her familial displacement.This movie might not mean that much to you if you haven't seen The Graduate. Too much emphasis is put on this other movie, rather than the writer, directors, whatever actually focusing on THIS movie. Hell, it might not mean much to you if you have. It's an intriguing premise, but the whole let's-use-the-movie-The-Graduate-as-a-tag-to-get-people-to-see-this-movie, isn't that great of an idea.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 5]","One of the main things that helps me rate films is how memorable they are, and with RUMOR HAS IT this became a bit sticky. The conundrum comes from my extreme enjoyment of THE GRADUATE (1967), something that RUMOR HAS IT makes no small claim to being a sort of sequel to.THE GRADUATE was sexy, funny, ahead of its time, and even explicitly inappropriate. RUMOR HAS IT tries to ratchet up these areas but doesn't succeed due to poor acting, poor casting (with one exception) and a senseless script.Jennifer Aniston plays Sarah Huttinger, the granddaughter of Katherine Richelieu (Shirley MacLaine playing the aged Mrs. Robinson/Anne Bancroft), and she soon discovers that the women in her family have a ""thing"" for Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner playing an middle-aged Benjamin Braddock/Dustin Hoffman). Sarah (Aniston) is engaged to be married but something inside her makes her hesitate before heading to the alter. She doesn't act or look anything like anyone in her family and she feels that maybe she was adopted. Her mother died years ago and can't give her any answers, so she goes to see Grandma Katherine (MacLaine) to see if she has any. A pandora's box of information suddenly gushes forth as Sarah learns her family was the basis for the book and film, The Graduate. She also learns that Beau (Costner) may be her father, since her mother also slept with him right before Sarah's mother and father were married.Coming to terms with the fact that Beau isn't her father is both tough and touching (one of the few truly memorable moments of the movie.)But RUMOR HAS IT just isn't that engaging. It's not nearly as sexy as THE GRADUATE was and it's not nearly as funny, either. The film makers try to ""shock"" the audience by having Sarah and Beau sleep together while the true nature of Sarah's paternity remains unclear (""This isn't The Graduate, this is Deliverance!"") But the shock just doesn't take us where we need to go. It's not funny, dramatic, or even that interesting.The one exceptional portion of this movie lay with Shirley MacLaine. Stealing nearly every scene she's in, MacLaine was the epitome of a damaged woman trying to keep her granddaughter from becoming just as screwed up as she. But even her excellent performance couldn't save the film ...unfortunately. Costner and Aniston looked out of place and miscast, completely lacking any kind of true chemistry, thus making the entire film unmemorable.",2,MaLaine Steals The Show ...But Even That Can't Save This Flick,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,2425,"['One', 'main', 'things', 'rate', 'films', 'how', 'memorable', 'are', 'RUMOR', 'IT', 'became', 'bit', 'sticky', 'conundrum', 'extreme', 'enjoyment', 'THE', 'GRADUATE', '1967', 'something', 'RUMOR', 'IT', 'small', 'claim', 'being', 'sort', 'sequel', 'to.THE', 'GRADUATE', 'was', 'sexy', 'funny', 'ahead', 'time', 'even', 'explicitly', 'inappropriate', 'RUMOR', 'IT', 'ratchet', 'up', 'areas', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'due', 'poor', 'acting', 'poor', 'casting', 'one', 'exception', 'senseless', 'script.Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Sarah', 'Huttinger', 'granddaughter', 'Katherine', 'Richelieu', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'playing', 'aged', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson/Anne', 'Bancroft', 'soon', 'discovers', 'women', 'family', 'have', 'thing', 'Beau', 'Burroughs', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'playing', 'middle-aged', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock/Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Sarah', 'Aniston', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'something', 'hesitate', 'heading', 'alter', ""n't"", 'act', 'look', 'anything', 'anyone', 'family', 'maybe', 'was', 'adopted', 'mother', 'died', 'years', 'ago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'answers', 'see', 'Grandma', 'Katherine', 'MacLaine', 'see', 'pandora', 'box', 'information', 'suddenly', 'forth', 'Sarah', 'family', 'was', 'basis', 'book', 'film', 'Graduate', 'also', 'Beau', 'Costner', 'may', 'be', 'father', 'mother', 'also', 'slept', 'right', 'Sarah', 'mother', 'father', 'were', 'married.Coming', 'terms', 'fact', 'Beau', ""n't"", 'father', 'tough', 'touching', 'one', 'few', 'truly', 'memorable', 'moments', 'movie', 'RUMOR', 'HAS', 'IT', 'just', ""n't"", 'engaging', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'sexy', 'THE', 'GRADUATE', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'funny', 'either', 'film', 'makers', 'try', 'shock', 'audience', 'having', 'Sarah', 'Beau', 'sleep', 'together', 'true', 'nature', 'Sarah', 'paternity', 'unclear', ""n't"", 'Graduate', 'Deliverance', 'shock', 'just', ""n't"", 'take', 'where', 'need', 'go', 'not', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'even', 'interesting.The', 'one', 'exceptional', 'portion', 'movie', 'lay', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Stealing', 'nearly', 'scene', 'MacLaine', 'was', 'epitome', 'damaged', 'woman', 'trying', 'keep', 'granddaughter', 'becoming', 'just', 'screwed', 'up', 'even', 'excellent', 'performance', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'Costner', 'Aniston', 'looked', 'place', 'miscast', 'completely', 'lacking', 'kind', 'true', 'chemistry', 'thus', 'making', 'entire', 'film', 'unmemorable']",N/A

974353,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000EMGICS,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[1, 1]","""Rumor Has It"" is a family movie about a woman in search of clues from her past- clues that will help her sort out why she is so different from her real father and give her the wisdom she needs to decide about marriage in general and whether or not it's the right move for her. Rumor Has It, while not a sequel, has similarities to the classic film ""The Graduate"" and the latter is mentioned several times in this movie.As everyone knows, The Graduate centered around a young man who falls for the seduction of an older woman named Mrs. Robinson and then later falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine. In Rumor Has It, a similar situation occurs, except this time around it's Kevin Costner playing the role of ladies man and this time the main character nabs three different generations of a family rather than only two. Jennifer Aniston- one of the few bright spots in this film- falls for the charms of Costner's character and she continues the trend, in spite of the fact that just moments earlier she thought he was her biological father.The basic plot of this movie is a little bit interesting but I don't like the way Rob Reiner pulls it all together. The film starts out with good intentions as Aniston's character goes off on a manhunt, hoping to discover that a total stranger is her real father so that she will finally understand once and for all why she is so different from the rest of her family. But rather than make this into an intriguing movie full of personal drama and suspense, Reiner decides to make it a light hearted comedy that starts out running and then slams into a concrete wall about midway through. Once the question about whether or not Kevin Costner is Jennifer Aniston's father has been answered, the movie really loses steam. Reiner doesn't do much else with the movie at this point, allowing it to fizzle out for the next thirty to forty minutes.This movie has been classified as a romantic comedy but it really isn't that funny. I think I counted one funny line through the entire movie (a toast made by Shirley MacLaine to her soon to be married granddaughter Annie). But at the same time, this isn't really a drama either because it lacks the involvement and seriousness one would expect in a good family drama. Again, Reiner let this aspect of the movie get away from him. I'm quite surprised by this, because usually Rob Reiner can be counted on to make some good, solid movies whether they are comedies or serious in nature.Among the performances, only Jennifer Aniston and Shirley MacLaine are up to snuff. The other performances are not very memorable and Mark Ruffalo's character doesn't have much chemistry with Aniston's at all. They don't seem like a good couple and I didn't find myself cheering them on or hoping they would work things out in the end and become the happily married couple that Aniston's parents were not. I really didn't care at this point.Overall, Rumor Has It is a sub- par film that ranks among Rob Reiner's weaker efforts. I wouldn't say it's a total dud because I have seen worse films during the past year. But with an all- star cast like this and with someone with Reiner's experience behind the camera, I expected it to be much better than it turned out.",2,The Rumors are True: This Movie Isn't Very Good,1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,3241,"['Rumor', 'family', 'movie', 'woman', 'search', 'clues', 'past-', 'clues', 'will', 'help', 'sort', 'out', 'why', 'so', 'different', 'real', 'father', 'give', 'wisdom', 'decide', 'marriage', 'general', 'not', 'right', 'move', 'Rumor', 'not', 'sequel', 'similarities', 'classic', 'film', 'Graduate', 'latter', 'mentioned', 'several', 'times', 'movie.As', 'everyone', 'Graduate', 'centered', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'seduction', 'older', 'woman', 'named', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'then', 'later', 'love', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'daughter', 'Elaine', 'Rumor', 'Has', 'similar', 'situation', 'time', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'playing', 'role', 'ladies', 'man', 'time', 'main', 'character', 'nabs', 'three', 'different', 'generations', 'family', 'rather', 'only', 'two', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston-', 'one', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'film-', 'charms', 'Costner', 'character', 'trend', 'spite', 'fact', 'just', 'moments', 'earlier', 'thought', 'was', 'biological', 'father.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'together', 'film', 'out', 'good', 'intentions', 'Aniston', 'character', 'off', 'manhunt', 'hoping', 'discover', 'total', 'stranger', 'real', 'father', 'will', 'finally', 'understand', 'once', 'why', 'so', 'different', 'rest', 'family', 'rather', 'make', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'full', 'personal', 'drama', 'suspense', 'Reiner', 'make', 'light', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'out', 'running', 'then', 'slams', 'concrete', 'wall', 'midway', 'question', 'not', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'father', 'been', 'answered', 'movie', 'really', 'steam', 'Reiner', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'else', 'movie', 'point', 'allowing', 'fizzle', 'out', 'next', 'thirty', 'forty', 'minutes.This', 'movie', 'been', 'classified', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'really', ""n't"", 'funny', 'think', 'counted', 'one', 'funny', 'line', 'entire', 'movie', 'toast', 'made', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'soon', 'be', 'married', 'granddaughter', 'Annie', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'really', 'drama', 'either', 'involvement', 'seriousness', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'good', 'family', 'drama', 'Again', 'Reiner', 'let', 'aspect', 'movie', 'get', 'away', ""'m"", 'quite', 'surprised', 'usually', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'make', 'good', 'solid', 'movies', 'are', 'comedies', 'serious', 'nature.Among', 'performances', 'only', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'are', 'up', 'snuff', 'other', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'memorable', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'character', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'chemistry', 'Aniston', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'good', 'couple', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'cheering', 'hoping', 'would', 'work', 'things', 'out', 'end', 'become', 'happily', 'married', 'couple', 'Aniston', 'parents', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'point.Overall', 'Rumor', 'Has', 'sub-', 'par', 'film', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'weaker', 'efforts', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'total', 'dud', 'have', 'seen', 'worse', 'films', 'past', 'year', 'all-', 'star', 'cast', 'someone', 'Reiner', 'experience', 'camera', 'expected', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'turned', 'out']",N/A

The performances of the cast lift it above the norm--Shirley MacLaine is very funny, Anniston is good in a very Rachel-type role, Ruffalo's part is well done if not real demanding and he continues to be a likeable presence in these romantic comedies; Costner is  in his laid-back and genial mode and only Mena Suvari seemed a bit overdone or irritating.  It's not world-shaking comedy but it's funny; it's not world-shaking anything but it doesn't pretend to be; and I found it several cuts above recent comedies that were more highly touted (""The Family Stone""--with a bunch of mean-spirited, snotty and unattractive relatives ; ""Failure to Launch""--a bit funnier but featuring a boneheaded overgrown juvenile; ""How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days""--one of the most irritating and least funny movies in a long time).If you can lighten up and just go with a slightly wacky and insubstantial comedy with funny characters played by pros, you will probably enjoy this film more than you expect to.",4,Underrated Comedy,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,1447,"['Boy', 'what', 'bunch', 'soreheads', 'have', 'reviewed', 'film', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'carping', 'reviews', 'However', 'did', 'watch', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'plot', 'such', 'agree', 'pretty', 'skewed', 'featherweight', 'been', 'reviewed', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'will', 'address', 'only', 'overall', 'quality', 'movie', 'found', 'very', 'entertaining', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'great', 'depth', 'originality', 'what', 'was', 'obviously', 'bit', 'fluff', 'performances', 'cast', 'lift', 'norm', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'very', 'funny', 'Anniston', 'good', 'very', 'Rachel-type', 'role', 'Ruffalo', 'part', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'real', 'demanding', 'be', 'likeable', 'presence', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Costner', 'laid-back', 'genial', 'mode', 'only', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'seemed', 'bit', 'overdone', 'irritating', 'not', 'world-shaking', 'comedy', 'funny', 'not', 'world-shaking', 'anything', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'found', 'several', 'cuts', 'recent', 'comedies', 'were', 'more', 'highly', 'touted', 'Family', 'Stone', 'bunch', 'mean-spirited', 'snotty', 'unattractive', 'relatives', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'bit', 'funnier', 'featuring', 'boneheaded', 'overgrown', 'juvenile', 'How', 'Lose', 'A', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'one', 'most', 'irritating', 'least', 'funny', 'movies', 'long', 'time', 'can', 'lighten', 'up', 'just', 'go', 'slightly', 'wacky', 'insubstantial', 'comedy', 'funny', 'characters', 'played', 'pros', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'more', 'expect']",N/A

We all know that this movie is a speculation as to what it would be like if the book and movie, The Graduate, was real and how Jennifer Anniston's character, Sarah, deals with it.  There is actually a tiny bit more meat to it.  Sarah feels lost and unsure about life and her place in it and feels she has nothing in common with her dad and sister (mom having passed away years ago).  When she discovers that this man who slept with both her mom and grandmother (Shirley MacLaine in all the only real bright spots in the movie) slept with her mom 9 months before she was born she goes on a search for him thinking the answer to this quest could explain her feelings.Now you could make a decent movie out of that concept.  Too bad this isn't it.  Instead after it being proven (or is it?) that Beau (Kevin Costner) cannot be dear old dad Sarah ends up in the same night kissing (Ewww) then sleeping with (EWWWW!!!!) this man she was just asking if he might be her dad.  I don't care how it ends up, that ain't right!If that's not enough, while she's dining and dancing it up with the man who, if not her dad is obviously old enough to be (and slept with her mom and grandma by the way), her super fiance played entirely likable by the entirely likable Mark Ruffalo is worried sick about her as she ignores his calls (with no real explanation other than she's too busy tying to find herself by kissing and sleeping with old men).  When he flies cross country just to check on her safety because he hasn't heard from her in days and catches her kissing the man who would be dad you only feel crushed for him and want her to get dumped.I don't think I'm being harsh when I say by the end of the movie I don't care if Sarah gets her fiance back and hope he kicks her to the curb.  Who would want to marry someone so flaky that she hopes someone else is her dad to explain her empty feelings (hey, we all get those from time to time lady!) then kisses and sleeps with the old codger, cheating on her fiance, when he's not.There are a couple of funny moments, sure.

974371,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000EMGICS,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 6]","There are moments in this inconsequential 2005 comedy when I can see a bright future for Jennifer Aniston's light comedic talents, even though this movie does not stretch her much beyond her likeably insecure ""Friends"" persona. She plays Sarah Huttinger, a likeably insecure New York Times obituary writer going home to Pasadena to attend her younger sister Annie's wedding. Sarah is picture-pretty, 33 and engaged to a nice, unflappable guy named Jeff who accompanies her. At the same time, she's unhappy about her career and wondering why she always feels out-of-sorts with her well-to-do family. A ray of light comes from her only kindred spirit in the family, her feisty, tart-tongued grandmother Katherine, who tells Sarah about her late mother's pre-wedding tryst in Mexico that gives rise to questions about Sarah's paternity.All the domestic shenanigans that ensue would probably be enough to fill this comedy's blessedly brief 96-minute running time, but screenwriter Ted Griffin hangs it all on the idea that Sarah's family may have been the inspiration for the Robinsons in Charles Webb's 1963 novel, ""The Graduate"", which of course, is the basis of Mike Nichols' classic 1967 movie. The tie-in must have sounded like a creative idea on paper, but something happened on the way to the screen that has taken most of the comic invention out of it. In fact, there is a pervasive lethargy throughout this movie, and director Rob Reiner is unable to overcome it because Sarah's dilemma of choosing between adventure and predictability never feels that emotionally resonant. The dialogue never feels sharp, perceptive or funny enough to pull off the inevitable comparisons with the earlier film. Moreover, the story is set rather arbitrarily in 1997 to make the timelines make sense with the stars' ages.Beyond Aniston, a strong cast has been set adrift. Playing Katherine like an even more embittered variation on Aurora Greenway, Shirley MacLaine crackles with aplomb as the possible inspiration for Mrs. Robinson, even when her lines are not as snappy as she thinks they are. As the aging but still magnetic Benjamin Braddock doppelganger, a high-tech mogul named Beau Burroughs, an overly sedate Kevin Costner barely registers in a smallish role. When he does, there is an insinuating, almost creepy quality in the way Beau's relationship with Sarah evolves. Until the end, Mark Ruffalo has little to do as Jeff but wait patiently for Sarah to resolve her personal dilemma. Richard Jenkins and Mena Suvari have even less time to make an impression in the underwritten roles of Sarah's passive father and bubbly sister, respectively. The 2006 DVD provides the original theatrical trailer (which gives away most of the plot) as its sole extra.",2,"Resuscitating a Classic Movie with a Lacking, Lethargic Sequel Three Decades Later",1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,2750,"['are', 'moments', 'inconsequential', '2005', 'comedy', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'bright', 'future', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'light', 'comedic', 'talents', 'even', 'movie', 'not', 'stretch', 'much', 'likeably', 'insecure', 'Friends', 'persona', 'Sarah', 'Huttinger', 'likeably', 'insecure', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'obituary', 'writer', 'going', 'home', 'Pasadena', 'attend', 'younger', 'sister', 'Annie', 'wedding', 'Sarah', 'picture-pretty', '33', 'engaged', 'nice', 'unflappable', 'guy', 'named', 'Jeff', 'who', 'same', 'time', 'unhappy', 'career', 'wondering', 'why', 'always', 'feels', 'out-of-sorts', 'well-to-do', 'family', 'ray', 'light', 'only', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'family', 'feisty', 'tart-tongued', 'grandmother', 'Katherine', 'who', 'Sarah', 'late', 'mother', 'pre-wedding', 'tryst', 'Mexico', 'rise', 'questions', 'Sarah', 'paternity.All', 'domestic', 'shenanigans', 'ensue', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'enough', 'fill', 'comedy', 'blessedly', 'brief', '96-minute', 'running', 'time', 'screenwriter', 'Ted', 'Griffin', 'idea', 'Sarah', 'family', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'inspiration', 'Robinsons', 'Charles', 'Webb', '1963', 'novel', 'Graduate', 'course', 'basis', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'classic', '1967', 'movie', 'tie-in', 'must', 'have', 'sounded', 'creative', 'idea', 'paper', 'something', 'happened', 'way', 'screen', 'taken', 'most', 'comic', 'invention', 'fact', 'pervasive', 'lethargy', 'movie', 'director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'unable', 'overcome', 'Sarah', 'dilemma', 'choosing', 'adventure', 'predictability', 'never', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'dialogue', 'never', 'sharp', 'perceptive', 'funny', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'inevitable', 'comparisons', 'earlier', 'film', 'Moreover', 'story', 'set', 'rather', 'arbitrarily', '1997', 'make', 'timelines', 'make', 'sense', 'stars', 'ages.Beyond', 'Aniston', 'strong', 'cast', 'been', 'set', 'adrift', 'Playing', 'Katherine', 'even', 'more', 'embittered', 'variation', 'Aurora', 'Greenway', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'aplomb', 'possible', 'inspiration', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'even', 'when', 'lines', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'snappy', 'are', 'aging', 'still', 'magnetic', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'doppelganger', 'high-tech', 'mogul', 'named', 'Beau', 'Burroughs', 'overly', 'sedate', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'barely', 'smallish', 'role', 'When', 'insinuating', 'almost', 'creepy', 'quality', 'way', 'Beau', 'relationship', 'Sarah', 'evolves', 'end', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'little', 'do', 'Jeff', 'wait', 'patiently', 'Sarah', 'resolve', 'personal', 'dilemma', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'have', 'even', 'less', 'time', 'make', 'impression', 'underwritten', 'roles', 'Sarah', 'passive', 'father', 'bubbly', 'sister', 'respectively', '2006', 'DVD', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'away', 'most', 'plot', 'sole', 'extra']",N/A

The beginning, while Jennifer Aniston's character is telling about the history of the story of the Graduate, got me to thinking that I must have read wrong because it seemed like it was going to be a pretty good movie.  Then the movie actually started and the first scenes in the airplane caused me to completely abandon those thoughts.Things got better when Shirley MacLaine's character is introduced because she made the story more interesting with her sharp and witty dialogue.  I think the only time I laughed, or found the movie entertaining, were the scenes she was in.  I was bored with the story of Sarah - and I don't think the writers knew what they wanted from her relationship with Mark, so they just wrote her character based off of that.I hate when movies don't know where they're going and by the time they figure it out, you've lost interest and are just waiting for the end to finally come.

This will by no means be an Oscar contender, but as a pleasant diversion on a weekend afternoon, or possibly as a date movie (for those who still go on dates), this could be a winning movie.  Jennifer Aniston, late of 'Friends', plays a role that is in many ways reminiscent of the Rachel role - she is a transplanted New Yorker, returning home to L.A. (actually, Pasadena, which becomes a running joke) with her as-yet-unannounced fianc&eacute; to attend her younger sister's wedding.  We learn all of this in the first few minutes, possibly before the credits are done scrolling on the screen - the frenetic pace of 'Friends' is still here.Rumour has it that there was a family in Pasadena that the film 'The Graduate' is based upon - Sarah (Anniston) fixates upon the idea that this may be her family.  She questions her grandmother (Shirley MacLaine, but don't call her grandmother), who tells of a possible affair her mother had with a playboy before her marriage (Kevin Costner, now a dot-com mega-millionaire).  Sarah goes off without her fianc&eacute; in search of her mother's past, but finds a past of her own, of a sort.Lots of twists and turns in the film have the characters racing up and down the coast of California in search of the past, the future, and the truth, which ends up being both expected and unexpected in this complicated but easily-followed plot.There aren't major effects and major surprises here.  The situational comedy is very much in keeping with an extended version of a comfortable television show, even with the star power of MacLaine and Costner backing Anniston up.  The writing is serviceable with occasional flashes of true wit, and the pace of the film is even and pleasant.  In all, this is a good film, well worth seeing for a bit of entertainment.

It seems that Aniston returns for her sister Annie's (Mena Suvari) wedding to hunky Scott (Steve Sandvoss from 'Latter Days' fame) with her affianced Jeff (Mark Ruffalo) only to realize that she doesn't seem to fit into Pasadena much less her family.  Never close to her father (Richard Jenkins) she hears that her mother had a fling with one Beau (Kevin Costner) and that she may be the offspring of Beau and her mother.  How she discovers the reality of the rumor is the point (or lack thereof) of the movie.With Aniston, MacLaine, Ruffalo, Costner and Jenkins in the cast the film has to have some good points - and it does.  It is just that the idea for the story is too lame to digest and too poorly written to buy into, making this a film to watch only if you happen to love the cast.

The problem seems to be Jennifer Aniston who is the primary ingredient.  While obviously a cute lady who wears some stunning outfits in this film (my daughter kept muttering, ""I want that dress!"" during the Ball sequence), Aniston's current skills seem destined to small screen sit-coms with their quick cuts and limited character development.Her acting skills on the big screen are inadequate compared to other ""leading"" actresses.  Good actresses on film need to convey far more than she apparently can with facial expressions, gestures, body language, etc. -- she needs to SHOW more of how her character is thinking and reacting.  Many times Aniston's expressions intended to show deep concern, thoughtful understanding, or passionate anger come off as simply looking quizzical or confused.  I realize that's possibly Rob Reiner's fault as the director, but other Aniston movies tell the same tale about her facial expressions.  Is Jennifer Aniston the ""Zoolander"" of female leading ladies?Having said that, this movie is not without some virtues: Shirley MacLaine always, in particular, and the male characters at various times throughout.

Stewart""","[4, 4]","I am not impressed but I can not say that watching Rumor Has It was total waste of my time because it has a few funny  moments, some solid performances and at times comes very close to what could have been a great movie. The main problem here is the awfully written script. It supposed to be a romantic comedy, but it is not funny and  it is not romantic. None of the characters are developed to the point where I would care about them. I did not see Beau Burroughs as shallow and hopeless womanizer. In fact, I saw a sensitive and tender man who is a victim of unfortunate circumstances. In his school years he suffered trauma, which left him infertile. Later on he was seduced by an older woman, then he had brief romance with her daughter with whom he has had ""the three most beautiful days in his life"". Watching her leaving him broke his heart. Why didn't he stop her?  Perhaps, he felt insecure due to trauma consequences. Or may be, he was afraid to reveal his painful secret. Who knows? So much potential is wasted with this character. It could've been much more interesting and engaging if the script allowed it.The miscast leading actress is the other problem. I really wanted to see Jennifer Anniston  portraying someone different from Rachel of Friends, but it didn't happen. In Rumor Has It, Anniston plays Sarah Huttinger, a young woman, whose family was the inspiration for the classic book and movie The Graduate. Coming back home to Pasadena with her fianc&eacute; Jeff /Mark Ruffalo for the wedding of her younger sister, Sarah realizes that she has almost nothing in common with her family. She decides to find Beau Burroughs/ Kevin Costner, the man who had an affair with her grandmother/Shirley McClain, and her deceased mother,  and who might be her real father. In pursuit for the ""truth"" Sarah gets carried away and loses her fianc&eacute;. After realising what really matters in her life she goes to New York to win back the heart of her man. This could've been sophisticated and significant role. Sadly, it is not. It is shallow and the lack of chemistry between Aniston and Costner doesn't help. For instance, in a tender moment when Beau Burroughs  opens his heart to Sarah, she says to him ""I've got to pee"". Does that supposed to be funny? I thought it was absolutely pathetic!  The final of this movie is spoiled the same way. Sarah asks her fianc&eacute;'s forgiveness and  says all the right things. It is a powerful and touching scene until the moment he tells her, he'll forgive and marry her, but if they have a daughter, Beau Burroughs will never be allowed near the child. Sarah replies ""It stops with me"". Unbelievable!Well for me, the film stopped  even before that.

You can see the cracks in the plot open up like chasms after an earthquake, and whole storylines just get lost forever.  One director after another tried fixing up the results, it must have been enormously expensive, and finally they brought in Rob Reiner to polish it all up.  Wonder why poor Kathy Bates, in a honey blonde wig, had only one scene to play?  I forget what her name is in the movie, but whatever it is she's playing ""Exposition.""  It's up to her to shoulder the whole burden of the back story, including keeping the treasured high school yearbooks from the 1950s.The scenarists had also to backdate the storyline by ten or twelve years, so that in the present day, it's 1990 or 1992--the early days of the coming internet revolution.  (And yet all the actors have the hairstyles and outfits of today.)  Why?  because otherwise the plot would have Jennifer Aniston playing a woman of 40 or so, and that just wouldn't have been very cute for poor Jennifer.  Because she was supposed to be the daughter born to the real life originals of the ""Elaine"" and ""Benjamin"" characters in THE GRADUATE, forever fixed as a mid-sixties book and movie.  It's like a giant jack inserted underneath a flat tire of a movie, this shift back to an earlier time, and yet still there's remnants of a plot in which Jennifer Aniston accidentally pockets Mark Ruffalo's cell phone.Didn't you think she was going to find, like Brittany Murphy in LITTLE BLACK BOOK, that her innocent good boy boyfriend had a secret life, a whole cell phone filled with other women's numbers?Well, she did in an earlier avatar of the script.  Then LITTLE BLACK BOOK came out and the producers realized they would have to change everything, so forget about the portable phone subplot.Then they must have thought that Nellie McKay was going to be the next big thing, not realizing that everyone, even Nellie McKay's mom and dad, eventually has a saturation point beyond which they beg, ""Please, not another Nellie McKay song on the soundtrack!""The creepy dead ghost father from SIX FEET UNDER plays Jennifer Aniston's father in this one.

Generally that's fair, because in the end it's their name taking the credit (or blame) for the success or failure of the movie. Unfortunately there's so much and so many people involved in the production of a film that the end result can't be pinned on any one person.As is the case here. And frankly, everyone involved deserves their fair share of the blame: starting with the insipid, cliche-ridden script by Ted (T.M) Griffin (Matchstick Men, Ocean's 11), to Rob Reiner (Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally) and his ham-fisted direction (Meathead!), to the entire, wasted cast, especially Kevin Costner and Jennifer Aniston, who have absolutely no chemistry with each other and who deliver each bland line like they're reading them cold for the first time.The story here actually has kind of a nifty premise: Aniston plays Sarah Huttinger, a cute, annoying perky young woman (an awful lot like Aniston's character in 'Friends' - go figure.), whose family was the inspiration for the classic coming of age book (and movie), The Graduate. Coming back home to Pasadena with her new lawyer fiance, Jeff (the usually sturdy Mark Ruffalo, who seems forever doomed to playing the sweet, caring, loser-guy) for the wedding of her cuter, blonder, and even more-annoyingly perky tennis playing sister, at some point Sarah realizes that she has almost nothing in common with her family, and sets out to find Beau Burroughs (played by Costner, taking a much needed break from his usual cute, dishevelled and slightly over the hill drunk womanizer to play a fabulously rich and powerful, cute, disheveled and slightly over the hill drunk womanizer), the man who had an affair with her grandmother (Shirley MacLaine, over-acting and scene-stealing, as usual) and her deceased mother - and who just might be her real father.In due course, Beau tells his story, he and Sarah get drunk and spend the night together (!), then he endeavors to wisk her off her feet, until their little affair is found out by the worried-sick Jeff; and then the contrived plot just gets ever dumber and more predictable.One thing I've learned - if the rental box has to tell you a movie is funny (and this one does!), it probably isn't. If you're in the mood for a light, romantic comedy, go back and watch When Harry Met Sally instead, and leave this one for the bargain bin at the video store.",2,So...

974399,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000EMGICS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I know that the critical reception to ""Rumor Has It"" was very chilly, but something about the idea of the film really appealed to me. The concept, the plot conceit, is a genuinely clever notion. Being a fan of ""The Graduate,"" I was interested to see how well they would integrate the characters of that film with the real life counterpoints in this film. I mean, come on, Shirley MacLaine representing Mrs. Robinson and Kevin Costner as Ben Braddock--seems like a great idea! But, alas, when all is said and done--an amusing and well conceived setup did not equal a satisfying movie experience, for me.Jennifer Aniston returns to her Pasadena homestead with her new fiance, played by Mark Ruffalo. Plagued with doubts about her engagement, and seemingly disengaged from any real affection for her own family, she hears a rumor that leads her to suspect that the book and film of ""The Graduate"" were based on her deceased mother's experiences. Confirming that her grandmother (MacLaine) was indeed the Mrs. Robinson character, she deduces that her mother had a fling prior to marrying her father. Thus, with the notion that she might be the daughter of this man--she sets off to find the truth. Encountering Costner, as the potential daddy and Ben Braddock character, she discovers truths about herself and her family.All of this plays out very routinely, but the supporting actors are engaging and comfortable. It's always great to see MacLaine, but she offers nothing new or inventive in this performance--it's the standard brassy MacLaine persona we've come to expect. Costner continues to embrace his middle-aged status and has, thus, developed into a far more interesting actor than he used to be. (But for a more nuanced and astute role, check him out in ""The Upside of Anger"" with the luminous Joan Allen.) And Mark Ruffalo, a great serious actor, continues to play lightly as a romantic leading man. Recently cast with Witherspoon, Garner, and now Aniston in lightweight fluff--I do miss the more challenging roles he used to take on.But it is Aniston's character, to me, that is a despicable movie creation--one that I've seen all too frequently, but this one is supposed to be endearing. Born into a life of privilege, she has accomplished nothing in her 30+ years and has become a self-involved and unpleasant Woman-child. She floats through her sister's wedding as if it's all some great inconvenience. She doesn't think twice about mistreating a man who loves her. She never acts on anything that doesn't blatantly promote her own self-interest. I'm just so tired of it--it's not charming. Don't get me wrong--there are plenty of Man-child movies too (more so, even) about men who still act as if they were adolescent. But, think about those movies--the Man-child is an object of scorn and ridicule, we laugh at him. But ""Rumor Has It"" doesn't ask you to laugh at Aniston's social ineptitude and selfishness--far from it--we're supposed to embrace it and identify with her as a real person. Well, frankly, I wished everyone in Aniston's life would abandon her because of her behavior so that she'd learn to grow up. But, of course, this is wish fulfillment--and she learns about life while retaining everything of value--there is never any consequence to being a nasty person.This gender double standard really bothers me, and the fact that I genuinely disliked the central character--obviously, I didn't care for this film.

974404,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000EMGICS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","Screenwriter Ted Griffin (""Ocean's Eleven,"" ""Matchstick Men"") gets high marks for showing restraint in coming up with this ""sequel,"" of sorts, to ""The Graduate.""  ""Rumor Has It..."" could have been played a lot broader, especially when you are talking about Shirley MacLaine playing the role of the woman who was the model for Mrs. Robinson.  This could have been a farce (remember the sequel idea that Buck Henry pitches at the start of ""The Player""?), but it ends up being a romantic comedy that actually places a premium on the characters more than the comedy.The movie is set a decade ago so that Sarah Huttinger is old enough to basically be Jennifer Aniston's age. As we all know from the trailer, Sarah discovers that her family is the basis for the Robinsons in the book that became the movie.  Her grandmother, Katharine Richelieu (MacLaine) is the original Mrs. Robinson, which makes Sarah's mother, Jocelyn Richelieu (seen only in flashback so that the image of Katharine Ross persists), ""Elaine"" in the configuration.  The immediate question is who then is ""Benjamin Braddock.""  When Sarah goes to visit her Aunt Mimi (an uncredited Kathy Bates) to find out about the skeletons in the family closet, lights come on and suddenly the finger of fate points to Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner).Obviously there are some differences between ""The Graduate"" and the story of the Huttinger family.  Instead of ""Benjamin"" rescuing ""Elaine"" at the church from marrying ""Carl,"" what happened was a week before Jocelyn married Earl Huttinger (Richard Jenkins), she ran off to Mexico to be with Beau.  Then she came back, got married, and eight-and-a-half months later had Sarah.  Jeff Daly (Mark Ruffalo), who is engaged to Sarah, points out the implications of the math.  Consequently, Sarah has to track down Beau and ask the big question: Are you my daddy?Such a scene could be played for laughs, or certainly more laughs than director Rob Reiner goes for in this 2005 film.  What I found most interesting about this film is that the best moments are not really comedic and ultimately ""Rumor Has It..."" is waiting to give Jennifer Aniston her moment.  The first moment comes when she confronts Beau, but it is really his scene and before he ever gets around to going for the hat trick he deals honestly with her situation (Costner is building on what he accomplished in ""The Upside of Anger"" as a supporting player).  The second comes when her father tells her the rest of the story that she thought she knew.  Then we come to the end of the film when Sarah finally has her moment and actually the film I was thinking about at that point was ""Notting Hill.""""Rumor Has It..."" is an enjoyable film because it is a gimmick film that does not overplay its hand (nice use of the opening guitar licks from ""Mrs. Robinson"").  It knows that these are not the character from ""The Graduate,"" but that some-and not all-of them are real people on whom the story was based.  The fact that Jocelyn has been dead since Sarah was nine, and that Sarah is now older than her mother was when she died, become key parts of the dynamic.  The great irony here is that Sarah proves to be her mother's daughter, but not in the way she thought and not the way in which this movie would lead you to believe.  Team Aniston is still looking for a cinematic home run and this is not it, but it is nice ground-rule double and you have to admit, she is one of the best weepers of her generation.",4,"Jennifer Aniston in an engaging little ""sequel"" to ""The Graduate""",1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,3463,"['Screenwriter', 'Ted', 'Griffin', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'high', 'marks', 'showing', 'restraint', 'coming', 'up', 'sequel', 'sorts', 'Graduate', 'Rumor', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'lot', 'broader', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'talking', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'playing', 'role', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'model', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'farce', 'remember', 'sequel', 'idea', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'pitches', 'start', 'Player', 'up', 'being', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'actually', 'premium', 'characters', 'more', 'comedy.The', 'movie', 'set', 'decade', 'ago', 'so', 'Sarah', 'Huttinger', 'old', 'enough', 'basically', 'be', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'age', 'know', 'trailer', 'Sarah', 'family', 'basis', 'Robinsons', 'book', 'became', 'movie', 'grandmother', 'Katharine', 'Richelieu', 'MacLaine', 'original', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'Sarah', 'mother', 'Jocelyn', 'Richelieu', 'seen', 'only', 'flashback', 'image', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'persists', 'Elaine', 'configuration', 'immediate', 'question', 'who', 'then', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'When', 'Sarah', 'visit', 'Aunt', 'Mimi', 'uncredited', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'find', 'out', 'skeletons', 'family', 'closet', 'lights', 'come', 'suddenly', 'finger', 'fate', 'points', 'Beau', 'Burroughs', 'Kevin', 'Costner', '.Obviously', 'are', 'differences', 'Graduate', 'story', 'Huttinger', 'family', 'Instead', 'Benjamin', 'rescuing', 'Elaine', 'church', 'marrying', 'Carl', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'week', 'Jocelyn', 'married', 'Earl', 'Huttinger', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'ran', 'off', 'Mexico', 'be', 'Beau', 'Then', 'came', 'back', 'got', 'married', 'eight-and-a-half', 'months', 'later', 'had', 'Sarah', 'Jeff', 'Daly', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'engaged', 'Sarah', 'out', 'implications', 'math', 'Consequently', 'Sarah', 'track', 'down', 'Beau', 'ask', 'big', 'question', 'Are', 'daddy', 'scene', 'could', 'be', 'played', 'laughs', 'certainly', 'more', 'laughs', 'director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', '2005', 'film', 'What', 'found', 'most', 'interesting', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'comedic', 'ultimately', 'Rumor', 'waiting', 'give', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'moment', 'first', 'moment', 'when', 'Beau', 'really', 'scene', 'ever', 'going', 'hat', 'trick', 'honestly', 'situation', 'Costner', 'building', 'what', 'accomplished', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'supporting', 'player', 'second', 'when', 'father', 'rest', 'story', 'thought', 'knew', 'Then', 'come', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Sarah', 'finally', 'moment', 'actually', 'film', 'was', 'thinking', 'about', 'point', 'was', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Rumor', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'gimmick', 'film', 'not', 'overplay', 'hand', 'nice', 'use', 'opening', 'guitar', 'licks', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'are', 'not', 'character', 'Graduate', 'some-and', 'not', 'all-of', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'whom', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'fact', 'Jocelyn', 'been', 'dead', 'Sarah', 'was', 'nine', 'Sarah', 'now', 'older', 'mother', 'was', 'when', 'died', 'become', 'key', 'parts', 'dynamic', 'great', 'irony', 'here', 'Sarah', 'be', 'mother', 'daughter', 'not', 'way', 'thought', 'not', 'way', 'movie', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'Team', 'Aniston', 'still', 'looking', 'cinematic', 'home', 'run', 'not', 'nice', 'ground-rule', 'double', 'have', 'admit', 'one', 'best', 'weepers', 'generation']",N/A

It was apparently supposed to be set in 1997 (when it was filmed in 2004/2005, why I have no idea), and there's a really obvious mention about James Cameron's Titanic, which wouldn't have been out yet. It had already been mentioned that it was January 1997, which would mean the film wasn't even OUT yet. Hats also disappear clean off character's head from one shot to the next, hair goes from behind the ear to loose (that really bugs me!)Why exactly is Kathy Bates uncredited as well? Sure, she's hardly in the film but still! There's a lot of references to other films, the main one being The Graduate, which I haven't actually seen. Many reviewers have said that Rumor Has It is like a sequel to The Graduate. No it's not. It's just referencing it, and updating the story a little for a new generation.The film's basically about a girl finding out her grandmother actually inspired the film (why not the book? It was a book first! The book was mentioned once, and then she even watches a video of The Graduate) The Graduate. She discovers her grandmother & mother had a fling with this one man, who she promptly thinks is her father, but then discovers he's sterile, so has a fling with him too. (How many guys would have used the ""I'm sterile"" line just to get a girl into bed?)The thing that gets me is that you can see from the start of the film is that the relationship that Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) is in isn't gonna last. They're engaged - but she doesn't wear the ring. They try to join the Mile High Club, but fail miserably.The film's perfectly entertaining, it's not a bad movie and alright for a day off work, when the weather's windy and rainy outside. It's instantly forgettable, Jennifer plays her usual role, as does Mark Ruffalo (can we try showing some emotion, or a different facial expression please? Move aside Heath Ledger, I've found a new candidate!)

Ruffalo and MacLaine are pretty good, but playing characters they've played before, especially MacLaine.  If you've seen her somewhat-crotchety grandmother-type role, then you've seen her in this, too.

That would be the premise, and pretty ingenious one, for Rumor Has It... The movie follows Jennifer Aniston (Leprechaun) as she slowly starts to realize that her mother and grandmother were the people who inspired The Graduate. Throwing a bigger wrinkle into her life is the possible that the real life Dustin Hoffman character could be her father.The dude in question is Kevin Costner (Waterworld) who plays the real life graduate even though he never did but as he tells it The Dropout wasn't as catchy. Shirley McLaine (Cannonball Run II) is the matriarch and first female in the family to bed Costner. Then there is Mark Ruffalo, who has been in almost forty films but has yet to be memorable in one, as Aniston's fianc&eacute;e who puts up with her cold feet and search for her possible father because, well, he looks like Mark Ruffalo and she looks like Jennifer Aniston. Rounding out the cast is my hero, Shooter McGavin himself as one of Costner's business buddies.Even though the plot is a clever one, the film sinks in its delivery which seems to be a theme in the last couple movies I've seen. It is like the producers, which this film actually had ten of including Ocean's 11 duo of George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh, get a topic that they feel could write itself. But in this film, the laugh are far and few in between or beat to death. The funniest bits come when they reference the film especially when Aniston wonder why she wasn't told of her family secret to which Ruffalo sing ""But most of all you got to hide it from the kids."" But not all The Graduate reference are great as it sometimes felt as if you needed to just see the film to get the joke, which I haven't in more than a decade. Another sticking point with the film was Aniston in full Rachel Green mode not getting the memo that this was a film and not a sitcom.

Director Rob Reiner, who practically redefined romantic comedies with ""When Harry Met Sally,"" has run aground.The premise of this film is exactly what you have seen in the film trailers and TV ad campaigns.  Jennifer Aniston plays Sarah Huttinger, a young woman headed home to Pasadena to attend her younger sister Annie's (Mena Suvari) wedding.  She brings her fiance Jeff (the outstanding Mark Ruffalo), but she doesn't want to reveal her engagement to her family yet.  Her mother passed away when she was just 9 years old, and Sarah is obviously still reeling from that loss.  She picks up on a rumor that her mother and grandmother (Shirley Maclaine, underperforming her role) were the two women involved with the same man on whom ""The Graduate"" was based.  The difference here is that Sarah's mother married her father (Richard Jenkins of Six Feet Under, giving the best performance of the film)instead of running off with the other guy (Kevin Costner).What follows is  a mishmosh of situations that aren't funny or very interesting.  I did manage a small laugh or two, but I can't remember the joke(s).  The script is overly complex and the conclusion is predictable.

Remember when he used to make funny films or has it been too long?Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) and Jeff (Mark Ruffalo) travel back to her childhood home for the wedding of her sister (Mena Suvari). Sarah doesn't want to tell the family that she and Jeff have just become engaged; she doesn't want to steal the thunder from her sister. Jeff doesn't get it, but he agrees. During the evening, Grandma Katherine (Shirley MacLaine), reveals a secret about Sarah's mom, leading the young woman to believe her family was the basis for the film ""The Graduate"". ""Aunt"" Mitzi (Kathy Bates) reveals that Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner) dated her mother right before she was married. Sarah begins to suspect that Burroughs may actually be her father and decides she needs to find him. She flies to San Francisco, where he is giving a lecture.""Rumor Has It"" has all of the hallmarks of a great, zany comedy yet the only element that consistently works is Shirley MacLaine. The few times she is on screen, the film becomes alive with promise. Katherine is a rich woman beyond caring what anyone thinks of her. As a result, she says whatever she wants, providing the film's four or five funny lines. Unfortunately, MacLaine isn't in the film enough to save it.Jennifer Aniston is having a problematic transition to ""Movie Star"". Her last good film was ""The Good Girl"", an independent film she made while ""Friends"" was still earning her $20 million a year. Perhaps she felt the security of the show allowed her to take some risks, some chances, and it paid off. ""The Good Girl"" was critically acclaimed and earned Aniston a lot of good reviews. Since then, she has only appeared in big budget ""romantic comedies"" and the unfortunate ""Derailed"". In ""Rumor"", Aniston presents yet another variation on Rachel, her character from ""Friends"". Imagine her TV persona, only whinier, ditsier, and more annoying and you begin to get a picture of her performance in the film.Kevin Costner's performance is interesting only because he seems to have found a second career playing men his actual age, more interesting characters than he has in some time. He was great in ""The Upside of Anger"" as a boozy former jock turned sport radio show jock. In ""Rumor"", his character is just too creepy to be likable. Why exactly would he want to sleep with Sarah, a woman so much his junior? Okay, that was a dumb question. Yes, it continues the tradition of the original film, but Sarah is in a relationship. And he still sleeps with her even after learning he has already slept with her mother and her grandmother. Sarah also knows this. And both people still let it happen. Why? It is enough to generate nightmares. And it isn't funny or romantic.Also, early in the film, there is some question if Burroughs (Costner) is in fact Sarah's (Aniston) father. After he convinces her he isn't her biological father, they hop into the sack together. Later, at a fancy ball, Sarah runs into Burroughs' son, who unwittingly asks her to sleep with him. Somehow, I feel the filmmakers think this is a funny situation which is why they bring it up again. And again. Later, Sarah tells her sister she isn't so screwed up. ""Did you sleep wit a man who slept with mom and Grandma Katherine?"" Her sister responds ""Oooooh, you slept with Dad? Dad slept with Grandma Katherine?"" Har-de-har har. I guess I can see how the potential act of incest is funny. Can you sense the sarcasm? More than one person in the audience made an audible gasp when the film started to go down this path. I sense that Reiner lost more than a handful of potential admirers with this storyline.One thing they didn't seem to feel necessary was to come up with an original ending.

974448,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000EMGICS,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","`Rumor Has It' has two good things in it: interesting cast including hilarious Shirley MacLaine, and Ted Griffin's curious and intriguing idea about the 'origin' of classic film `The Graduate.' For the reasons I don't know Griffin (who is attached to the film as director) left the set, and Rob Reiner took up the project. Then something happened to the film, which should be more original and intriguing. `Rumor Has It' is still cozy and charming in its own way, but is a great missed opportunity.The plot starts like a standard romantic comedy, but there is one clever twist in it; that is, Jennifer Aniston's heroine Sarah, already vaguely angst-ridden about her future, suddenly finds the `Truths' about her mother's life. Sarah comes to believe that her deceased mom was actually the model of Katherine Ross character in `The Graduate.' Charles Webb, she insists, wrote the story of Benjamin Braddock in `The Graduate' based on the real life of one Beau Burroughs, who is still living somewhere in America.Leaving behind her nice and understanding fianc&eacute;e (played by underrated Mark Ruffalo), Sarah travels to meet Beau (Kevin Costner). The consequences of their meeting should not be told here, but anyway you can tell from the miles away.Very clever and intelligent initial setting gradually turns into a middling rom-com path where so many others have already passed. It is Rob Reiner who once directed charming `When Harry Met Sally...' and we naturally expect something better or different. But sorry, no such luck here.Naturally (and deservedly) Shirley MacLaine steals every scene as the grandmother with an acid tongue. Richard Jenkins is excellent as Sarah's slightly odd father, cute Mena Suvari is cute as ever, and you even see handsome Mike Vogel. Uncredited Kathy Bates also appears (with a very strange hair), and Jennifer Aniston and Mark Raffalo are both good, the incarnation of nice, good-looking American couple, if nothing more. But Kevin Costner is a huge disappointment, who should have been the inspiration of Dustin Hoffman character in `The Graduate' but shows little of the charms of Ben of the Mike Nichols film.Oh, and the closing chapters are simply banal, throwing away any cleverness of the original idea about `The Graduate' or the life in Pasadena, and take the safest course throughout. If Shirley Maclaine had punched Costner in the face, the film would be much funnier. I expected to see something like that, but got no chance of seeing it. Just a comfortable, unoriginal, and insipid ending of `Ever After.'",2,"Starts with a Clever Idea, Turns a Middling Romantic Comedy with Disappointing Ending",1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,2557,"['Rumor', 'two', 'good', 'things', 'interesting', 'cast', 'including', 'hilarious', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Ted', 'Griffin', 'curious', 'intriguing', 'idea', ""'origin"", 'classic', 'film', 'Graduate', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Griffin', 'who', 'attached', 'film', 'director', 'left', 'set', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'took', 'up', 'project', 'Then', 'something', 'happened', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'original', 'intriguing', 'Rumor', 'still', 'cozy', 'charming', 'own', 'way', 'great', 'missed', 'opportunity.The', 'plot', 'standard', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'one', 'clever', 'twist', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'heroine', 'Sarah', 'already', 'vaguely', 'angst-ridden', 'future', 'suddenly', 'Truths', 'mother', 'life', 'Sarah', 'believe', 'deceased', 'mom', 'was', 'actually', 'model', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'character', 'Graduate', 'Charles', 'Webb', 'wrote', 'story', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'Graduate', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'Beau', 'Burroughs', 'who', 'still', 'living', 'somewhere', 'America.Leaving', 'nice', 'understanding', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'played', 'underrated', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Sarah', 'meet', 'Beau', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'consequences', 'meeting', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'told', 'here', 'anyway', 'can', 'tell', 'miles', 'away.Very', 'clever', 'intelligent', 'initial', 'setting', 'gradually', 'middling', 'rom-com', 'path', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'passed', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'who', 'once', 'directed', 'charming', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'naturally', 'expect', 'something', 'better', 'different', 'sorry', 'such', 'luck', 'here.Naturally', 'deservedly', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'steals', 'scene', 'grandmother', 'acid', 'tongue', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'excellent', 'Sarah', 'slightly', 'odd', 'father', 'cute', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'cute', 'ever', 'even', 'see', 'handsome', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'Uncredited', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'also', 'very', 'strange', 'hair', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Mark', 'Raffalo', 'are', 'good', 'incarnation', 'nice', 'good-looking', 'American', 'couple', 'nothing', 'more', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'inspiration', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'Graduate', 'little', 'charms', 'Ben', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'film.Oh', 'closing', 'chapters', 'are', 'simply', 'banal', 'throwing', 'away', 'cleverness', 'original', 'idea', 'Graduate', 'life', 'Pasadena', 'take', 'safest', 'course', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'had', 'punched', 'Costner', 'face', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'funnier', 'expected', 'see', 'something', 'got', 'chance', 'seeing', 'Just', 'comfortable', 'unoriginal', 'insipid', 'ending', 'Ever']",N/A
974449,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000EMGICS,Wayne C. Rogers,"[2, 4]","As a big fan of the sixties' movie, The Graduate, with Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft as the delectable Mrs. Robinson, I found the storyline of Rumor Has It to be somewhat intriguing.  What would happen if a young woman returned to her home in southern California to attend her sister's wedding, only to find out by accident that the book and film of The Graduate was actually based on her family?  Let's take the premise even one step further.  What would happen if this woman began to suspect that the young man that her mother and grandmother had an affair with was really her own dad and not the man her mom eventually married?This is the setup for Rumor Has It with Jennifer Aniston playing Sarah, who's just gotten engaged to her boyfriend, Jeff, and now finds herself having doubts about the whole thing as she attends her younger sister's wedding.  While there, her grandmother (played wonderfully by Shirley MacLaine) after having one too many drinks, accidentally lets the cat out of the bag that The Graduate might have been based on her and her daughter's affair with the same young man, Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner).  Since Sarah's mother spent a few days with Beau in Mexico just before she got married to another man, Sarah begins to suspect that she might be Beau's daughter.  Rather than flying home to New York with her boyfriend after the wedding is over, she takes off to San Francisco to find Beau and hopefully to learn the truth about who her real father might actually be.I found myself thoroughly enjoying Rumor Has It.  Though I'm not a big Jennifer Aniston fan (I did like her in Derailed), I felt she handled the dynamics of her role perfectly.  Kevin Costner's acting chops seem to be improving with age, much like an expensive wine.  He conveyed just the right amount of emotion as a middle-aged man who suddenly finds this young woman standing in front of him, thinking that he's her father.  Of course, what happens after that is for you to find out when you see the film.  I will say that Shirley MacLaine steals the movie with every minute of on-screen time that she has as the outrageous grandmother who's not afraid to speak her mind and who's still hurt from being dumped by Beau for a younger model so many years before.  I could easily see Ms. MacLaine as the seducer of young men when she was in her thirties and forties.  Even now, she's still a pistol that's too hot to handle.  Though the ending is somewhat predictable, this is a good date movie that will have you thinking about love and the fear of commitment.  No extras on the DVD, which probably means that the Special Collector's Edition of the Unrated Director's Cut will be out in a few months with a lot of nifty behind-the-scenes stuff.",4,"Here's to you Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you can know!!!",1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,2744,"['big', 'fan', 'sixties', 'movie', 'Graduate', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'delectable', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'found', 'storyline', 'Rumor', 'Has', 'be', 'somewhat', 'intriguing', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'young', 'woman', 'returned', 'home', 'southern', 'California', 'attend', 'sister', 'wedding', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'accident', 'book', 'film', 'Graduate', 'was', 'actually', 'based', 'family', 'Let', 'take', 'premise', 'even', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'woman', 'began', 'suspect', 'young', 'man', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'had', 'affair', 'was', 'really', 'own', 'dad', 'not', 'man', 'mom', 'eventually', 'married', 'setup', 'Rumor', 'Has', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'playing', 'Sarah', 'who', 'just', 'gotten', 'engaged', 'boyfriend', 'Jeff', 'now', 'having', 'doubts', 'whole', 'thing', 'younger', 'sister', 'wedding', 'there', 'grandmother', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'having', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'drinks', 'accidentally', 'cat', 'bag', 'Graduate', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'daughter', 'affair', 'same', 'young', 'man', 'Beau', 'Burroughs', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Sarah', 'mother', 'spent', 'few', 'days', 'Beau', 'Mexico', 'just', 'got', 'married', 'man', 'Sarah', 'suspect', 'might', 'be', 'Beau', 'daughter', 'Rather', 'flying', 'home', 'New', 'York', 'boyfriend', 'wedding', 'San', 'Francisco', 'find', 'Beau', 'hopefully', 'learn', 'truth', 'who', 'real', 'father', 'might', 'actually', 'be.I', 'found', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'Rumor', 'Has', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'fan', 'did', 'Derailed', 'felt', 'handled', 'dynamics', 'role', 'perfectly', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'acting', 'chops', 'seem', 'be', 'improving', 'age', 'much', 'expensive', 'wine', 'conveyed', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'emotion', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'who', 'suddenly', 'young', 'woman', 'standing', 'front', 'thinking', 'father', 'course', 'what', 'find', 'out', 'when', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'movie', 'minute', 'on-screen', 'time', 'outrageous', 'grandmother', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'speak', 'mind', 'who', 'still', 'hurt', 'being', 'dumped', 'Beau', 'younger', 'model', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'Ms.', 'MacLaine', 'seducer', 'young', 'men', 'when', 'was', 'thirties', 'forties', 'Even', 'now', 'still', 'pistol', 'too', 'hot', 'handle', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'good', 'date', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'love', 'fear', 'commitment', 'extras', 'DVD', 'probably', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', 'will', 'be', 'out', 'few', 'months', 'lot', 'nifty', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff']",N/A

Mass sedation is attractive but has other problems, and sometimes it's too early in the day for alcohol. The airlines' solution is to show movies like ""Rumor Has It."" It's amusing enough, safe enough for a cabin full of people with widely varying sensitivities, and 100% guaranteed not cause excitement of any kind. And it's available without a prescription.The premise is goofy, in a chick-flick kind of way. Sarah (Aniston), Katharine (Shirley MacLaine, and ""don't call me grandma"") and the family get together for the wedding of Sarah's neurotic sister. Somehow, Sarah digs into enough of the family girl-gossip to discover that Katharine was the original Mrs. Robinson, the one in the movie ""The Graduate."" She also comes to think (and hope) that the man who bedded both her grandmother and mother might be her biological father - and thus begins the quest.She of course finds him: Beau Burroughs (Costner). And finds him attractive, as did the two generations of women before her. And beds him, as did her mother and don't-call-me-grandmother. By screwing him, she also screws up her own relationship. After some inept running around, everyone ends up back where they belong, in a forgettably happy ending.There are a few amusing moments in the banter, including:-- ""Does every girl in my family have to go to bed with you?""-- ""They don't have to, they just do.""Aniston also delivers a bit of physical comedy that was almost enough to rouse a real laugh out of my torpid mind. (Don't worry, you'll recognize it when it comes.) Mostly, though, it's a two hour movie built around a ten minute joke. The almost-incestuous side of Sarah's affair with Beau creates some amount of tension, defused safely through humor and atoned for by Sarah's eventual contrition.On the whole, this movie delivers the three Ss that it was selected for: it's safe, silly, and sedative.--wiredweird",3,Rumor can keep it,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,2027,"['non-stop', 'flight', 'country', 'presents', 'least', 'one', 'big', 'problem', 'airlines', 'keeping', 'passengers', 'reasonably', 'happy', 'reasonably', 'inert', 'Mass', 'sedation', 'attractive', 'other', 'problems', 'too', 'early', 'day', 'alcohol', 'airlines', 'solution', 'show', 'movies', 'Rumor', 'amusing', 'enough', 'safe', 'enough', 'cabin', 'full', 'people', 'widely', 'varying', 'sensitivities', '100', '%', 'guaranteed', 'not', 'cause', 'excitement', 'kind', 'available', 'prescription.The', 'premise', 'goofy', 'chick-flick', 'kind', 'way', 'Sarah', 'Aniston', 'Katharine', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'grandma', 'family', 'get', 'together', 'wedding', 'Sarah', 'neurotic', 'sister', 'Somehow', 'Sarah', 'enough', 'family', 'girl-gossip', 'discover', 'Katharine', 'was', 'original', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'one', 'movie', 'Graduate', 'also', 'think', 'hope', 'man', 'who', 'bedded', 'grandmother', 'mother', 'might', 'be', 'biological', 'father', 'thus', 'quest.She', 'course', 'Beau', 'Burroughs', 'Costner', 'attractive', 'did', 'two', 'generations', 'women', 'did', 'mother', ""don't-call-me-grandmother"", 'screwing', 'also', 'up', 'own', 'relationship', 'inept', 'running', 'around', 'everyone', 'up', 'back', 'where', 'belong', 'forgettably', 'happy', 'are', 'few', 'amusing', 'moments', 'banter', 'including', 'girl', 'family', 'have', 'go', 'bed', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'just', 'do', 'Aniston', 'also', 'bit', 'physical', 'comedy', 'was', 'almost', 'enough', 'rouse', 'real', 'laugh', 'torpid', 'mind', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'when', 'Mostly', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'built', 'ten', 'minute', 'joke', 'almost-incestuous', 'side', 'Sarah', 'affair', 'Beau', 'amount', 'tension', 'defused', 'safely', 'humor', 'atoned', 'Sarah', 'eventual', 'contrition.On', 'whole', 'movie', 'three', 'Ss', 'was', 'selected', 'safe', 'silly', 'sedative.', 'wiredweird']",N/A
