My 7-month-old watches this  almost as intently as she does #1 - Baby Mozart... which is still much  better than other companies' video &quot;board-book&quot; or video  &quot;mobile&quot; products.All in all, Ms. Aigner-Clark's innovation  is quite remarkable - stimulating music and visuals to distract and aid in  child development. I give all of my friends the Baby Einstein Library  (which includes the videos Baby Mozart, Baby Bach and Baby Einstein) for  shower and baby gifts - and I receive raving 'thank yous.'These videos  can be life-savers when Mom or Dad need a couple of minutes of quiet to  themselves or to devote to other children. I am still surprised by shrieks  of delight from my daughter at some of the visuals. My four-star rating has  only yo do with my own lesser's opinion of this video's visuals and one  particularly annoying laugh-track AS COMPARED TO Baby Mozart (which I rate  at five-stars). My daughter would probably give them both five++.",4,"not quite Baby Mozart, but a strong #2",964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,1094,"['Baby', 'Bach', 'third', 'installation', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'Company', 'series', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Baby', 'Mozart', '7-month-old', 'watches', 'almost', 'as', 'intently', '1', 'Baby', 'Mozart', 'still', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'companies', 'video', 'quot', 'board-book', 'quot', 'video', 'quot', 'quot', 'products.All', 'Ms.', 'Aigner-Clark', 'innovation', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'stimulating', 'music', 'visuals', 'distract', 'aid', 'child', 'development', 'give', 'friends', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'Library', 'videos', 'Baby', 'Mozart', 'Baby', 'Bach', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'shower', 'baby', 'gifts', 'receive', 'raving', ""'thank"", 'yous', ""'These"", 'videos', 'can', 'be', 'life-savers', 'when', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'need', 'couple', 'minutes', 'quiet', 'devote', 'other', 'children', 'am', 'still', 'surprised', 'shrieks', 'delight', 'daughter', 'visuals', 'four-star', 'rating', 'only', 'yo', 'do', 'own', 'lesser', 'opinion', 'video', 'visuals', 'one', 'particularly', 'annoying', 'laugh-track', 'COMPARED', 'TO', 'Baby', 'Mozart', 'rate', 'five-stars', 'daughter', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'five++']",Baby Bach VHS
504162,A2FE8EIEGNWC41,B00000INEX,"Adam Cole ""Ministry of Silly Walks""","[2, 14]","In a certain sense, as a Bach fanatic, I support anything that exposes kids to his music.  So my 1-star rating is a bit awkward in that light.  However, I think it well worth pointing out that the music of Bach needs no video embellishment to captivate a child's attention.  As a toddler, I was given cassette tapes of Bach's music, and listened to them constantly.  In a very real sense, from about age 1 1/2 to 6 I lived *inside* the Brandenburg concertos, preludes, and fugues, and the immersive experience has irrevocably enhanced and deepened my perception and enjoyment of music to this day.  So, consider allowing your child to focus on the marvelous harmonic intricacy of Bach without the concurrent distraction of an irrelevant stream of baby photos and implicit toy ads.  Who knows? Maybe (s)he will grow up appreciating such music as more than mere auditory &quot;scenery&quot; (to which category Baroque music has largely been relegated in American society).",1,Bach doesn't need any help reaching kids.,983318400,"02 28, 2001",2001,970,"['certain', 'sense', 'Bach', 'fanatic', 'support', 'anything', 'kids', 'music', '1-star', 'rating', 'bit', 'awkward', 'light', 'However', 'think', 'well', 'pointing', 'out', 'music', 'Bach', 'video', 'embellishment', 'captivate', 'child', 'attention', 'toddler', 'was', 'given', 'cassette', 'tapes', 'Bach', 'music', 'listened', 'constantly', 'very', 'real', 'sense', 'age', '1', '1/2', '6', 'lived', 'Brandenburg', 'concertos', 'preludes', 'fugues', 'immersive', 'experience', 'irrevocably', 'enhanced', 'deepened', 'perception', 'enjoyment', 'music', 'day', 'So', 'consider', 'allowing', 'child', 'focus', 'marvelous', 'harmonic', 'intricacy', 'Bach', 'concurrent', 'distraction', 'irrelevant', 'stream', 'baby', 'photos', 'implicit', 'toy', 'ads', 'Who', 'Maybe', 's', 'will', 'grow', 'up', 'appreciating', 'such', 'music', 'more', 'mere', 'auditory', 'quot', 'scenery', 'quot', 'category', 'Baroque', 'music', 'largely', 'been', 'relegated', 'American', 'society']",Baby Bach VHS

504170,A1O3ONM1MJM7EM,B00000INEX,"C. Marsteller ""Cafreen""","[29, 32]","I agree with the other reviewers, Baby Mozart is the best of the series.  The problem with Baby Bach, Baby Santa's Music Box (the two others I have seen so far) is that there are scenes with children in them.  My daughter is not at all interested in the people scenes for some reason.  She loves all the movement and all the toys, and in the Bach series, there simply aren't as many moving toy scenes.  (Same goes for Baby Santa which is definitely the WORST of Baby Einstein.)I think the thing that bothers me the most about Baby Bach is that Julie Clark puts her children in it, and frankly, I find it to be the MOST annoying part of the show, thank goodness it's only for a few minutes.  Trying too hard to be cutesy, believe me, it's not at all cute.In buying the Baby Einsten tapes / DVDs (in general) I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised at my daughters reaction.  She is captivated by the (moving) scenery, it's amazing to see a five month old so interested, I almost want to videotape her watching it, yes it's that cute.  And I think you will be thrilled, too, when you see your child interact.Should you buy this one?  Sure, it's one of the better Baby Einstein tapes, but it's not the best.

We bought Baby Bach a few weeks later and, while she enjoyed it a little, Baby Bach is not as good.  There are a lot more static shots with little or no movement and some scenes are repetitious.  The producer also put their daughter (and other kids - maybe friends/neighbors) in the video and these scenes just don't fit in.  It's obvious that they were just stuck in because they thought that it would be ""cute"" - it really wasn't.

Baby Bach happens to be one of the ones I don't like.  It's just music with toys and spinning things; like many of the Baby Einstein videos.  One toy was pretty neat (a spinning top with blue water inside).  Other then that, what really is the point of these videos?  I really don't get it.  I can just imagine my kid wanting all the toys they see.  This video also had some very ugly clown faces in it.I still don't like most of the Baby Einstein puppets and this video is no exception.  At one point in the video you see a chicken puppet clucking.  Then a you hear a voice that starts to say something and then instead of the chicken you see a little girl (Aspen Clark).  She's apparently telling a joke.  The first time you see and hear this you don't really know what's going on because she starts telling this joke while you still see the chicken puppet.  By the time you understand that it's a girl telling a joke, the joke is half over.  Her question is very difficult to understand.  I had to listen four times to get what she says.  She asks, ""Why did the Mozart get rid of all his chickens?""  Then you hear a squeeky adults voice say, ""Why?""  Aspen then says, ""Because they kept saying Bach, Bach, Bach.""  Then you hear a bunch of adults in the background dying of laughter.  I am sorry but it's lame.  It's very poorly understandable and I don't think any babies or toddlers will even understand this joke.  I don't know why it was included.  At the very end of the video you see Aspen again and she says, ""The video of me is all done?  I'm not the star anymore?"" Again, the adults burst into laughter.  Sorry, I didn't find it funny.

The Mozart vid is far better music wise but I suggest buying the c.d.s and forgoing the vids for this collection altogether.",1,Blech!,1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,579,"['*love*', 'Bach', 'music', 'selection', 'video', 'hardly', 'best', 'stuff', 'composed', 'so', 'dumbed-down', 'downright', 'bad', 'not', 'dumbed-down', 'people', 'who', 'arranged', 'had', 'different', 'idea', 'figured-bass', 'most', 'others', 'have', 'seen', 'still', ""n't"", 'appeasing', 'ears', 'Also', ""'ve"", 'said', 'reviews', 'composer', 'vids', 'timing', 'vid', 'portion', 'Bach', 'video', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'Mozart', 'vid', 'far', 'better', 'music', 'wise', 'suggest', 'buying', 'c.d.s', 'forgoing', 'vids', 'collection', 'altogether']",Baby Bach VHS

My  principal objection is to the static shots of various musical instruments  accompanied by snatches of music that could not have possibly issued from  those pictured. To my mind it would have been more interesting to show  individuals playing those instruments.  There is a certain lifelessness to  the video as a whole increased by an echo chamber quality in some of the  music and voices.  Still, there just aren't that many videos out there for  kids that can't yet talk so I don't want to be overly critical. As far as  the frequent footage of producer's daughters...well it certainly provides  us parents with a warning that what we may find simply adorable in our  children just might be grating to others.  From now on I vow to limit the  number of baby photos I carry and the footage of home movies I show should  I ever purchase a camcorder.",3,Acceptable if annoying,968889600,"09 14, 2000",2000,991,"['16', 'month', 'old', 'video', 'as', 'much', 'Baby', 'Mozart', 'done', 'so', 'past', 'four', 'months', 'definitely', 'deficiencies', 'principal', 'objection', 'static', 'shots', 'various', 'musical', 'instruments', 'accompanied', 'snatches', 'music', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'possibly', 'issued', 'pictured', 'mind', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'show', 'individuals', 'playing', 'instruments', 'certain', 'lifelessness', 'video', 'whole', 'increased', 'echo', 'chamber', 'quality', 'music', 'voices', 'Still', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'videos', 'out', 'there', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'yet', 'talk', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'overly', 'critical', 'As', 'far', 'frequent', 'footage', 'producer', 'daughters', 'well', 'certainly', 'parents', 'warning', 'what', 'may', 'find', 'simply', 'adorable', 'children', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'grating', 'others', 'now', 'vow', 'limit', 'number', 'baby', 'photos', 'carry', 'footage', 'home', 'movies', 'show', 'should', 'ever', 'purchase', 'camcorder']",Baby Bach VHS

Although, I love the music of Bach, this video was a disappointment. I found the segments of the creator's daughter a bit too rehearsed and quite honestly, I'm not sure why they put her into it. It affects the flow of the video. Both Baby Mozart and Baby Bach appear &quot;homemade&quot;, but Baby Mozart has much better flow and better choices of &quot;real world objects&quot;.
