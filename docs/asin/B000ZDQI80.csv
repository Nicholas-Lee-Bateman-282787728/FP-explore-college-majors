I was lucky enough to find that a friend of mine had recorded game 1 on VHS, but subsequently dissappointed when I discovered that the infamous call to Kirk Gibson's pinch-hit walkoff HR was not from the TV airing :(  I know it's a long shot, but Yankees Classics dubs the radio broadcast over the games a lot so I figure it's worth asking if anyone knows if it was done here?(Please ignore my rating since I have not viewed this DVD!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I assume there is no pregame or postgame included like other MLB World Series releases)",4,"""I don't believe, what I just saw!""",1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,788,"['OK', 'Dodgers', 'fans', 'probably', 'know', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'just', 'watched', 'boxset', 'am', 'looking', 'find', 'out', 'chance', 'game', '1', 'radio', 'commentary', 'dubbed', 'rather', 'original', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'commentary', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'find', 'friend', 'mine', 'had', 'recorded', 'game', '1', 'VHS', 'subsequently', 'dissappointed', 'when', 'discovered', 'infamous', 'call', 'Kirk', 'Gibson', 'pinch-hit', 'walkoff', 'HR', 'was', 'not', 'TV', 'airing', 'know', 'long', 'shot', 'Classics', 'dubs', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'games', 'lot', 'figure', 'worth', 'asking', 'anyone', 'was', 'done', 'here', 'Please', 'ignore', 'rating', 'have', 'not', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'assume', 'pregame', 'postgame', 'included', 'other', 'MLB', 'World', 'Series']",La Dodgers 1988 World Series

We see the best of Tommy Lasorda as a manager, the coming of age of Orel Hershiser the famous Kirk Gibson home run off Eckersley and the blossoming of McGwire and Canseco as the bash brothers.  Little did we know about steroid use at that time. So the Lasorda-led Dodgers were able to defeat the more youthful and upstart Oakland As.  Another Oakland World Championship had to wait until 1989 (the very next season).This has to be a best seller among Dodger fans.  I bet Bruce Kendall has this in his collection.  It's a wonder that he hasn't reviewed it.",5,great series for Dodger fans,1208563200,"04 19, 2008",2008,599,"['What', 'interesting', 'World', 'Series', 'was', 'see', 'best', 'Tommy', 'Lasorda', 'manager', 'coming', 'age', 'Orel', 'Hershiser', 'famous', 'Kirk', 'Gibson', 'home', 'run', 'off', 'Eckersley', 'blossoming', 'McGwire', 'Canseco', 'bash', 'brothers', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'steroid', 'use', 'time', 'Lasorda-led', 'Dodgers', 'were', 'able', 'defeat', 'more', 'youthful', 'upstart', 'Oakland', 'As', 'Oakland', 'World', 'Championship', 'had', 'wait', '1989', 'very', 'next', 'season', '.This', 'be', 'best', 'seller', 'Dodger', 'fans', 'bet', 'Bruce', 'Kendall', 'collection', 'wonder', ""n't"", 'reviewed']",La Dodgers 1988 World Series

As a Dodger fan you may long for more than two games from the NLCS.Game 4 and 7 were both thrilling. However, that was an incredible series against The Mets. MLB should have put all seven games in the collection. I am not a fan of LA and I was wanting more. Overall, it is a nice set for any Dodger fan or a fan of baseball in general.",4,Worth A Look.,1227398400,"11 23, 2008",2008,423,"['are', 'Dodger', 'fan', 'baseball', 'junkie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'dvd', 'box', 'set', 'Dodger', 'fan', 'may', 'long', 'more', 'two', 'games', 'NLCS.Game', '4', '7', 'were', 'thrilling', 'However', 'was', 'incredible', 'series', 'Mets', 'MLB', 'should', 'have', 'put', 'seven', 'games', 'collection', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'LA', 'was', 'wanting', 'more', 'Overall', 'nice', 'set', 'Dodger', 'fan', 'fan', 'baseball', 'general']",La Dodgers 1988 World Series
1121906,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B000ZDQI80,P Magnum,"[2, 2]","If you are a Dodgers fan, then this set is a must own.  It has every game of the 1988 World Series which chornicles their improbable run to the club's six and final World Series title with their stunning five game victory over the heavily favored Oakland A's.  It also includes games five and seven from their equally stunning upset of the heavily favored New York Mets.  The '88 series is best remembered for Kirk Gibson's bottom of the ninth, two out home run off of Dennis Eckersley that is one of the most memorable moments in baseball history.  While the image of an injured Gibson hobbling around the bases pumping his fists is an iconic image, it was his only apperance of the entire series.  It was ace pitcher Orel Hershiser that was the true star of the series.  Pitching twice and throwing two complete games, he pitched a shut-out in game two and gave up a mere two runs in the clinching game five.",4,Last Dodgers Title,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,910,"['are', 'Dodgers', 'fan', 'then', 'set', 'must', 'own', 'game', '1988', 'World', 'Series', 'improbable', 'run', 'club', 'six', 'final', 'World', 'Series', 'title', 'stunning', 'five', 'game', 'victory', 'heavily', 'favored', 'Oakland', 'A', 'also', 'games', 'five', 'seven', 'equally', 'stunning', 'upset', 'heavily', 'favored', 'New', 'York', 'Mets', ""'88"", 'series', 'best', 'remembered', 'Kirk', 'Gibson', 'bottom', 'ninth', 'two', 'home', 'run', 'Dennis', 'Eckersley', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments', 'baseball', 'history', 'image', 'injured', 'Gibson', 'hobbling', 'bases', 'pumping', 'fists', 'iconic', 'image', 'was', 'only', 'apperance', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'ace', 'pitcher', 'Orel', 'Hershiser', 'was', 'true', 'star', 'series', 'Pitching', 'twice', 'throwing', 'two', 'complete', 'games', 'pitched', 'shut-out', 'game', 'two', 'gave', 'up', 'mere', 'two', 'runs', 'clinching', 'game', 'five']",La Dodgers 1988 World Series

All of us in LA will continue to prefer the Vin Scully called  as aired...when  Vinny just shut up and let the scene play out after he called the homer.Back to the set...its pretty great..a couple of games from the improbable Mets Series and then the complete world series..and lots of bonus interviews and awards  presentations on the last DVD.If you are a Dodger  fan...its hard to believe its been 20 years...buy this.  It is much more than one home run...Hershiser had one of the best seasons and post seasons a pitcher EVER had...and many fringe  players like Micky Hatcher came through in the clutch.  a  lot of  goodies here and lets hope 1981 when we (oops I've given away my bias) upset the Yankees gets this  sort of presentation!Go Big Blue!!",5,i HAVE seen it all and DO believe!!!,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,959,"['first', 'answer', 'question', 'reviewer', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'it..YES', 'bonus', 'feature', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'Kirk', 'Gibson', 'home', 'run', 'alternate', 'Joe', 'Buck', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'call', 'LA', 'will', 'continue', 'prefer', 'Vin', 'Scully', 'called', 'as', 'aired', 'when', 'Vinny', 'just', 'shut', 'up', 'let', 'scene', 'play', 'out', 'called', 'homer.Back', 'set', 'pretty', 'great..a', 'couple', 'games', 'improbable', 'Mets', 'Series', 'then', 'complete', 'world', 'series..and', 'lots', 'bonus', 'interviews', 'awards', 'presentations', 'last', 'DVD.If', 'are', 'Dodger', 'fan', 'hard', 'believe', 'been', '20', 'years', 'buy', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'home', 'run', 'Hershiser', 'had', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'post', 'seasons', 'pitcher', 'EVER', 'had', 'many', 'fringe', 'players', 'Micky', 'Hatcher', 'came', 'clutch', 'lot', 'goodies', 'here', 'hope', '1981', 'when', ""'ve"", 'given', 'away', 'bias', 'upset', 'Yankees', 'sort', 'presentation', 'Go', 'Big', 'Blue']",La Dodgers 1988 World Series
1121908,A3JOQX9FLASNVN,B000ZDQI80,"Thomas K. Craig ""NCAA Tournament Expert""","[3, 3]","This is one series that helped me out in a personal way. This is coming from a diehard Yankee fan but my grandmother was a diehard Dodgers fan and she died only 3 weeks before the Dodgers won the series. To this day will always pull for the Dodgers even if I am a Yankees fan. But this series was a great one as for me I watched all the games and was interested in the series because I knew how much my grandmother loved watching the Dodgers. And it was so fitting as they won as underdogs and made me feel great that they won for my grandmother and for them beating the A's, which I disliked at the time. But as for the set, I would recommend buying especially if your a Dodgers fan but it's great to have on the shelf even if your a baseball fan in general. It's great to watch baseball when all the players loved the game and not just the money. I thought the quality was great and it was always entertaining when Vin Scully was doing the game for NBC.
