1252277,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00274SITW,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[1, 1]","As a fan of Reno 911, I was told by many other fans to check out this DVD collection. Repeatedly, in fact. While I was a bit skeptical at first, I gave it a chance. After all, it came out during a period of time where MTV put out quality shows rather than umpteen reality shows about celebutants. Boy am I glad that I got this set.Where do I start? First off, this is a sketch show, so there's not really a plotline. (Although there are characters that are recurring characters.) The show had a great cast of comedians, most of which would go on to become highly recognizable stars in their own rights. The show is surprisingly risque for the time period, with one of the sketches in the first episode poking fun at sex & masturbation. (Guess that's the nice thing about being on cable!)You can tell that the show took place in the 90s (mostly by looking at the fabulous wardrobe), but the humor in it is pretty much timeless. I mean, who couldn't laugh at 'Old-fashioned Guy' or at Sid & Nancy appearing on a gameshow? If you can't find at least one thing to laugh at while watching this entire DVD set then the viewer must need a funny bone transplant.

(Would be 4 stars if not for the re-dubbing, as described below).People have complained about the music replacement and redubs about a billion times. Well, this is a billion and one, I suppose. That being said, It's not all that bad.For those new to the discussion, here's the long story made short: when originally aired, many of the sketches had popular songs playing in the background (some say, although I haven't been able to confirm it, at the insistence of MTV). When it came time for the DVD release, MTV didn't want to pay the royalties and therefore other music was substituted and in many cases entire sketches had to be re-recorded on audio and dubbed in.How much is lost? To be fair, not too much. Most of the re-dubbing/insertion of new music is pretty seamless and the original material stands out just the same. That being said, there are definitely a few instances in which the comic timing is lost in the new re-dubs (the Barry and Levon sketches stand out particularly, in my opinion).All that being said, The State, at least in my opinion, originally had a usual running ratio of 65% funny to 35% ""meh"" (that's an average, there were episodes that were funnier and episodes that were less funny). The new edits might change that to 60/40...not a big difference overall, but you might notice that one of your favorite bits doesn't work the way it used to.",3,"Good, but not as good as the original",1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,1470,"['loved', 'State', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'aired', 'probably', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'Would', 'be', '4', 'stars', 'not', 're-dubbing', 'described', '.People', 'have', 'complained', 'music', 'replacement', 'redubs', 'billion', 'times', 'Well', 'billion', 'one', 'suppose', 'being', 'said', 'not', 'bad.For', 'new', 'discussion', 'here', 'long', 'story', 'made', 'short', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'many', 'sketches', 'had', 'popular', 'songs', 'playing', 'background', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'confirm', 'insistence', 'MTV', 'When', 'came', 'time', 'DVD', 'release', 'MTV', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'pay', 'royalties', 'therefore', 'other', 'music', 'was', 'substituted', 'many', 'cases', 'entire', 'sketches', 'had', 'be', 're-recorded', 'audio', 'dubbed', 'in.How', 'much', 'lost', 'be', 'fair', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'Most', 're-dubbing/insertion', 'new', 'music', 'pretty', 'seamless', 'original', 'material', 'out', 'just', 'same', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'definitely', 'few', 'instances', 'comic', 'timing', 'lost', 'new', 're-dubs', 'Barry', 'Levon', 'sketches', 'stand', 'out', 'particularly', 'opinion', 'being', 'said', 'State', 'least', 'opinion', 'originally', 'had', 'usual', 'running', 'ratio', '65', '%', 'funny', '35', '%', 'meh', 'average', 'were', 'episodes', 'were', 'funnier', 'episodes', 'were', 'less', 'funny', 'new', 'edits', 'might', 'change', '60/40', 'not', 'big', 'difference', 'overall', 'might', 'notice', 'one', 'favorite', 'bits', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'used']",The State: The Complete Series

(How much can the Breeders want for the Video rights to Cannonball anyway? Go into Denny's and have them sign the release on their coffee break...)3) It is not for everybody. If you have never seen the State before you may find this show is not for you. If you are a fan of any of the performers or the shows and projects by the same artists that came after, then definitely give it a try.Still, I HAD to give this set at least 4 stars because: The Amazon price is much more reasonable than list, and this is REAL sketch comedy that is good, edgy, and takes risks. It is a rarity.I haven't seen most of these shows since their original airings. I have only seen the first disk of the DVD so far, and I am not dissapointed with my purchase. There is just something about this show that makes me love it. Sketch comedy is not easy, and the 11 writers and performers of the State could have taken the SNL route and made bland uninteresting sketches for the masses with repetitive catch phrases. Their show would have had much more mass audience appeal and it might even still be running today. But it wouldn't be half as funny as what we have here.While watching this show you get the feeling that the players were doing what made THEM laugh, and they were definitely having fun doing it. This is much more entertaining than the past 10 years of SNL or Mad TV. It is the true sign of good comedy. They take risks, are edgy without relying on a stream of profanities, and are not afraid to be just weird and stupid. Example: $240 worth of pudding. This is a Weird sketch about two guys talking to the camera about seducing and making love to $240 dollars worth of pudding. Sound Stupid? It is. Is it funny? IT IS HILARIOUS! (Note: They had to redub the soundtrack to take out the song ""Sexual Healing"", but even with the changes I was ROFL! How could they do and say that stuff with straight faces?!?)Some of the sketches fall flat, but the show barrels on through like a freight train and just keeps on going. They just keep taking chances and there is very little of the repetitiveness you see in other sketch shows.

1252283,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B00274SITW,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[0, 0]","After 15 long years of teenaged-level angst, the adolescents of the 90's have finally been heard: the comedic stylings of The State finally arrive in a DVD package so good, it makes $240.00 worth of pudding seem frigid.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So you think the world is unfair? Don't feel anyone ever listens to you? Have you been made fun of because your feet are made out of bologna sandwiches, or because you weren't gay in high school?Well, push all that misery aside: The State is coming to DVD. And, no, it isn't coming in a clear computer case with a black and white photocopy cover and sold from some guy's trunk. It's official, baby. Aaaaaaawwwww Yeeeeeah.This coming July 14th will mark the return of The State after 15 years of being copied onto VHS tapes and horribly edited YouTube videos. Even if you haven't seen these pirated pieces, I'm sure that you knew exactly what I was talking about by the time you read the intro. This is because The State is that iconic, even if it only survived three full seasons.For those of you that need a history lesson, The State is a comedy troupe consisting of Kevin Allison, Michael Ian Black, Robert Ben Garant, Todd Holoubek, Michael Patrick Jann, Kerri Kenney, Thomas Lennon, Joe LoTruglio, Ken Marino, Michael Showalter, and David Wain, all of whom wrote and acted in the skteches, and would have written me nasty letters if they were not included in that insanely long cast list. The State began as a college improv comedy group, and through hard work and talent, found a place on MTV, in our hearts, and eventually in Ken Marino's pants.The amazing thing about The State compared to most comedy sketch shows is that it did not rely on parody and satire as much as other shows did. Sure, the Sid and Nancy $7,000 Pyramid skit(season 1) and Stephen Hawking Stand-Up(unaired but on the DVD) were amazing displays of satire. However, The State brought their own quirky characters into the mix 90% of the time. Sometimes it was a humorous display of teenaged angst with Doug, or the uncomfortable display of two guys who still think it's 1973. Other times it was the self-deprecating cast disclaimers to the viewers. It could even be something so off the wall as eating Muppets. The point is that much of what the cast created was truly their own, without relying so much on current event lampooning. That is what creativity is all about: making the personally ridiculous seem funny to the general public. The State did this time and time again.So is it worth buying a DVD of such a show? Do these skits traverse time, or do they fall flat when they aren't cubbyholed in their generation? Yes, yes, and no. The jokes never get old to me, and because of some fancy ad-libbing on what the cast has explained in their interviews, it is because they did not rely on satirizing the times that The State can be laughed at by future generations. Even the extras are worth the time to watch. Not only do you get insight from the cast, but you get to see over 20 sketches that never made it through the editing room, and some of those were as funny as some of their best bits, no matter how short.Some of these include:Stephen Hawking Stand-UpCoach GunnerThompson's All Weather SealantKrispy Pops(man on the the street)Drag DadThen, of course, we have such classics as:Bologna FootSleep with The StateThe State Discuss SecretsThe Boner SongDan the Openly Gay High School StudentDougPiggy ShoesAh crap, I could go on forever.

1252286,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00274SITW,Mark Turner,"[12, 112]","I am a major fan of sketch comedy. Having been in my teen years when Saturday Night Live began and did its best work, I've remained a fan. I even made a point of visiting Second City whenever in its birthplace of Chicago and had the chance to witness some great comedic moments and stars on the rise. But even SNL has run the roller coaster route of up and down years, giving good and bad seasons.That being said, and knowing my love for this style of comedy, I was surprised with the new release of the MTV series from the past, THE STATE. I barely remembered the series but once I began watching I recalled why. I never thought it was all that good.As I watched each disc play I kept waiting to laugh. No joke, I never found myself even offering a grin at the items showing on the screen. Instead I watched what felt to me like people trying to be like the great sketch comedy groups that had come before and failing miserably.For those SNL fans who stuck through the series through thick and thin (don't include me here), you know there were years when the things they did just weren't funny. Instead they either relied on using sex or drugs to shock and get an audience reaction rather than a deep rooted laugh. THE STATE doesn't even go for those that often. Instead it just offers unfunny premises or attempts at jokes that fall flat.I witnessed characters that I could get the easiest laughs from the most juvenile of viewers. For example a party seems to be boring as all get out only to rise once the group's favorite friend shows announcing that he wants to dip his [...] (not the phrase he uses) into everything. A drink? He wants to dip into it. A bowl of something? He wants to dip into it as well. Gee, isn't that funny? I will say that his delivery of the line might be but once said the joke gets stale very quick.Perhaps the most amazing thing about this box set is that fans have been clamoring for it for some time. Heck, who would have thought it had that many fans? Online review sites note that the most disappointing thing about the box set is that they've altered the music since no one wants to pay for the rights to the original songs used. Who would have thought the day would come when people actually missed the music on something from MTV, a channel which has all but abandoned using music.I really wanted to like this show and this set. I went in with an open mind, especially since I didn't remember it all that well. Instead it offered a comedy show with nothing to laugh at. It felt more like a show where people tried to be funny like the originals they seemed to emulate, but fell far short.The comedy here relies more on how loud it can be and how over the top (for the time) the group thinks they can become. Unfortunately that doesn't offer long standing comedy gems. The humor in a Jack Benny sketch can still bring a laugh today more than 50-60 years after it was first heard or seen. This group can't muster a laugh (at least from me) after less than 20,If you consider yourself one of the fans of the series, you'll be delighter here. Not only do you get the entire series on four discs, you get commentary from the cast, some of the members on THE JON STEWART SHOW, outtakes, and more. Fans will definitely get their moneys worth. If you're not a fan, chances are you won't be converted.I am certain dedicated fans will think I haven't just paid close enough attention. They'll talk about how I just don't get what they were trying to do. They'll talk about how the most absurd situations presented were done so by an intelligent group of people who were trying to bring new standards to a tired old form. Too bad its just not funny.Perhaps the nice thing about this series was that is spawned the careers of many who went on to bigger and MUCH better things. Many of the casts are involved with RENO 911 in front of and behind the camera. They've been involved in writing things like NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM, BALLS OF FURY, THE PACIFIER and more. I'm sure, having listened to the extra commentaries here, that these shows hold fond memories for them. I'm sorry I can't say the same.",1,LAUGHLESS COMEDY,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,4123,"['am', 'major', 'fan', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'Having', 'been', 'teen', 'years', 'when', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'began', 'did', 'best', 'work', ""'ve"", 'remained', 'fan', 'even', 'made', 'point', 'visiting', 'Second', 'City', 'whenever', 'birthplace', 'Chicago', 'had', 'chance', 'witness', 'great', 'comedic', 'moments', 'stars', 'rise', 'even', 'SNL', 'run', 'roller', 'coaster', 'route', 'years', 'giving', 'good', 'bad', 'seasons.That', 'being', 'said', 'knowing', 'love', 'style', 'comedy', 'was', 'surprised', 'new', 'release', 'MTV', 'series', 'past', 'STATE', 'barely', 'remembered', 'series', 'once', 'began', 'watching', 'recalled', 'why', 'never', 'thought', 'was', 'good.As', 'watched', 'disc', 'play', 'kept', 'waiting', 'laugh', 'joke', 'never', 'found', 'even', 'offering', 'grin', 'items', 'showing', 'screen', 'Instead', 'watched', 'what', 'felt', 'people', 'trying', 'be', 'great', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'groups', 'had', 'come', 'before', 'failing', 'miserably.For', 'SNL', 'fans', 'who', 'stuck', 'series', 'thick', 'thin', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'here', 'know', 'were', 'years', 'when', 'things', 'did', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Instead', 'either', 'relied', 'using', 'sex', 'drugs', 'shock', 'get', 'audience', 'reaction', 'rather', 'deep', 'rooted', 'laugh', 'STATE', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'often', 'Instead', 'just', 'unfunny', 'premises', 'attempts', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat.I', 'witnessed', 'characters', 'could', 'get', 'easiest', 'laughs', 'most', 'juvenile', 'viewers', 'example', 'party', 'be', 'boring', 'get', 'out', 'only', 'rise', 'once', 'group', 'favorite', 'friend', 'announcing', 'dip', '[', ']', 'not', 'phrase', 'everything', 'drink', 'dip', 'bowl', 'something', 'dip', 'as', 'well', 'Gee', ""n't"", 'funny', 'will', 'say', 'delivery', 'line', 'might', 'be', 'once', 'said', 'joke', 'stale', 'very', 'quick.Perhaps', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'box', 'set', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'clamoring', 'time', 'Heck', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'had', 'many', 'fans', 'Online', 'review', 'sites', 'note', 'most', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'box', 'set', ""'ve"", 'altered', 'music', 'one', 'pay', 'rights', 'original', 'songs', 'used', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'day', 'would', 'come', 'when', 'people', 'actually', 'missed', 'music', 'something', 'MTV', 'channel', 'abandoned', 'using', 'music.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'show', 'set', 'went', 'open', 'mind', 'especially', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'well', 'Instead', 'offered', 'comedy', 'show', 'nothing', 'laugh', 'felt', 'more', 'show', 'where', 'people', 'tried', 'be', 'funny', 'originals', 'seemed', 'emulate', 'fell', 'far', 'short.The', 'comedy', 'here', 'more', 'how', 'loud', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'top', 'time', 'group', 'can', 'become', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'offer', 'long', 'standing', 'comedy', 'gems', 'humor', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'sketch', 'can', 'still', 'bring', 'laugh', 'today', 'more', '50-60', 'years', 'was', 'first', 'heard', 'seen', 'group', 'ca', ""n't"", 'muster', 'laugh', 'least', 'less', '20', 'consider', 'one', 'fans', 'series', ""'ll"", 'be', 'delighter', 'here', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'get', 'entire', 'series', 'four', 'discs', 'get', 'commentary', 'cast', 'members', 'THE', 'JON', 'STEWART', 'SHOW', 'outtakes', 'more', 'Fans', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'moneys', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'chances', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'converted.I', 'am', 'certain', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'will', 'think', 'have', ""n't"", 'just', 'paid', 'close', 'enough', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'how', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'do', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'how', 'most', 'absurd', 'situations', 'presented', 'were', 'done', 'so', 'intelligent', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'trying', 'bring', 'new', 'standards', 'tired', 'old', 'form', 'Too', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'funny.Perhaps', 'nice', 'thing', 'series', 'was', 'spawned', 'careers', 'many', 'who', 'went', 'bigger', 'MUCH', 'better', 'things', 'Many', 'casts', 'are', 'involved', 'RENO', '911', 'front', 'camera', ""'ve"", 'been', 'involved', 'writing', 'things', 'NIGHT', 'AT', 'THE', 'MUSEUM', 'BALLS', 'OF', 'FURY', 'THE', 'PACIFIER', 'more', ""'m"", 'sure', 'having', 'listened', 'extra', 'commentaries', 'here', 'shows', 'hold', 'fond', 'memories', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same']",The State: The Complete Series

The real star of the show was the comedy, not the background music, so I don't know why people are so worked up about it being replaced it doesn't make me laugh any less.The DVD presentation is very slick, with great menu screens and of course great transfers of some of my favorite sketches including:-Blueberry Johnson-Taco Man-The Audition-Monkeys Doin' It II-USMBTRBTThe commentaries featured on all the episodes are a fun (but not essential) listen with the members appearing in different groupings of 3-5 throughout. Due to this there is a lot of repetition of stories or conjecture as to who wrote what, etc. Surprisingly, Michael Patrick Jann ends up being the most enthusiastic and entertaining of the contributing members on the commentaries.Each disc has a series of 5-10 minute MTV backstage interviews that appear to be from the final season period of the show with Micheal Patrick Jann providing most of the group's history, while Micheal Ian Black provides goofy tours of the day to day goings on.Also featured are 5 minute reels of outtakes from various sketches, that usually end up being more extended footage than bloopers. I found the most entertaining to be uncut footage from ""The Prom"" segment, that really shows what the whole hilarious night was like.The un-aired sketches are many, but mostly forgettable (although they all have commentaries). Highlights include: ""Muskrats"", ""Disco Girl"" and ""Swamp Creature"". The special appearances are neat, especially seeing a young Jon Stewart stand patiently by as The State destroys his set.There are only 2 things that could have made the set better: A then & now type documentary featuring interviews with all 11 members (including footage of their recent live reunion shows) and clips of ""You Wrote It, You Watch It"" an MTV show featuring performances by The State that the group mentions over and over again during the commentaries but provides little detail on.Overall this is a fantastic set that took its time getting to us, but I'm glad it finally made it.",5,The State: Worth The Wait,1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,2145,"['living', 'off', 'memories', 'bootlegs', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'awesome', 'finally', 'have', 'complete', 'series', 'DVD', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'was', 'comedy', 'not', 'background', 'music', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'worked', 'up', 'being', 'replaced', ""n't"", 'make', 'less.The', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'very', 'slick', 'great', 'menu', 'screens', 'course', 'great', 'transfers', 'favorite', 'sketches', 'including', '-Blueberry', 'Johnson-Taco', 'Man-The', 'Audition-Monkeys', 'Doin', 'II-USMBTRBTThe', 'commentaries', 'featured', 'episodes', 'are', 'fun', 'not', 'essential', 'members', 'appearing', 'different', 'groupings', '3-5', 'Due', 'lot', 'repetition', 'stories', 'conjecture', 'who', 'wrote', 'what', 'etc', 'Surprisingly', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'Jann', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'enthusiastic', 'entertaining', 'contributing', 'members', 'commentaries.Each', 'disc', 'series', '5-10', 'minute', 'MTV', 'backstage', 'interviews', 'appear', 'be', 'final', 'season', 'period', 'show', 'Micheal', 'Patrick', 'Jann', 'providing', 'most', 'group', 'history', 'Micheal', 'Ian', 'Black', 'goofy', 'tours', 'day', 'day', 'goings', 'on.Also', 'featured', 'are', '5', 'minute', 'reels', 'outtakes', 'various', 'sketches', 'usually', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'extended', 'footage', 'bloopers', 'found', 'most', 'entertaining', 'be', 'uncut', 'footage', 'Prom', 'segment', 'really', 'what', 'whole', 'hilarious', 'night', 'was', 'like.The', 'un-aired', 'sketches', 'are', 'many', 'mostly', 'forgettable', 'have', 'commentaries', 'Highlights', 'include', 'Muskrats', 'Disco', 'Girl', 'Swamp', 'Creature', 'special', 'appearances', 'are', 'neat', 'especially', 'seeing', 'young', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'stand', 'patiently', 'State', 'set.There', 'are', 'only', '2', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'set', 'better', 'then', 'now', 'type', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'interviews', '11', 'members', 'including', 'footage', 'recent', 'live', 'reunion', 'shows', 'clips', 'Wrote', 'Watch', 'MTV', 'show', 'featuring', 'performances', 'State', 'group', 'mentions', 'over', 'again', 'commentaries', 'little', 'detail', 'on.Overall', 'fantastic', 'set', 'took', 'time', 'getting', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'made']",The State: The Complete Series

1252291,A2ONX15N6TWDR,B00274SITW,Vincenzo L.,"[4, 4]","While MTV occasionally offers up something worth watching, seemingly by accident, there was a time when they were on a hardcore winning streak, and that was the mid '90s, when the channel rolled the dice and managed to craft a truly unique and entertaining line-up with original series like Unplugged, The Maxx and, of course, The State. Handing the keys of a nationwide sketch comedy show to a gaggle of kids just out of college, whose biggest accomplishment to that point was working on the much-forgotten, yet prescient crowdsourcing series You Wrote It, You Watch It, was an actual programming risk, unlike airing yet another Laguna Hills series.That risk paid off though, at least for those who watched it, as The State delivered three or so seasons of sketch genius that deserved a place alongside the true legends of the genre, mostly because they were from a new generation of comedy troupes who learned from the pioneers, but wanted to blaze their own trail, a group that included The Kids in the Hall and the Upright Citizens Brigade. Taking influences from Monty Python and adding a healthy helping of pop-culture flavor, The State bent the expectations for sketch comedy and yet managed to practice the art to near perfection, until an ill-advised move away from the comfort of MTV to the more corporate, less-nurturing CBS ended their show.From the moment the unusual theme song kicks in, with it's rough, loud ""Boys and girls...action! Action!"", you know this show is something different. Utilizing links to move from sketch to sketch, filming with a mix of multiple camera and single camera shoots and mixing longer sketches with quick bits, the show built a legitimate sense of momentum that helped the group's absurd sensibility create a show where anything truly could happen. In a single episode you could have a slapstick-style food fight, a commercial parody, a kabuki scene, talking, vengeful seamonkeys and the story of a relationship with a toothbrush. There's no such thing as the prototypical The State sketch, with only the recurring character sketches bearing any resemblance to each other (and even those are parodies of recurring characters.)All the credit obviously goes to the troupe, who wrote and performed everything, and the talent they brought to the show is obvious in the success so many of them have had in the years since the show left the air. Considering how organic the group's origins are, with them being college pals and improv group colleagues before getting the show, the variety of styles they bring to the table is surprising, with a bit of everything amongst the 10 guys, including the overwhelmingly funny Michael Ian Black, Thomas Lennon and Ken Marino, and an unbelievably versatile and hilarious lady in Kerri Kenney-Silver. Of course, with just one female member, drag is also a big part of their arsenal, with their technique coming in somewhere between Monty Python and the Kids in the Hall, as there's not a lot of an attempt to be feminine, but the women don't tend to be as grotesque as some of the females portrayed on the Flying Circus. Truthfully, unlike SNL or many other sketch shows, there's not a weak link in the bunch, with even the lesser-known stars, like Todd Holoubek and Kevin Allison, having their moments of brilliance and overall solid performances.With hundreds of sketches included, it's hard to pick out a handful to highlight, without leaving out a ton of great ones, so instead focusing on the genres makes sense. The recurring characters, which were mostly foisted upon the group by MTV, looking to build popular bits, actually ended up becoming popular, despite making fun of the idea of a sketch built around a catchphrase. Thus we get several segments with Louie (Marino), a guy whose sole attribute is a desire to dip his (golf) balls in various items, and announcing that desire, along with teen rebel Doug (Michael Showalter), who is unable to cope with understanding authority figures, and busts out his own exit catchphrase (which itself is parodied in a sketch.) It's amazing how many times it feels like they are trying to not make a legitimate sketch, only to create a memorable one, like ""The Animal Song,"" a bizarre musical scene, or the Barry and Levon bits, which center around $240 worth of pudding.The show has aged surprisingly well, with bits that aren't hugely timely, though most of the MTV-focused segments, including an MTV Sports parody and several ""Free Your Mind"" commercials, may fall on the deaf ears and blind eyes of younger viewers. Making fun of talk shows, kids getting in trouble and sneakers that make piggy sounds when you step down on the heel are simply universal concepts, as is the extreme absurdism the show trades in. A commercial for cereal where everyone is at least mildly mentally retarded is an example of where this show is coming from, and that's just the first episode, as it just gets weirder from there, touching on monkey torture, dinnertime prayers for fratricide and Eastern European variety shows (the origin of the later Viva Variety series.) Having a line that's hard to cross, or no line at all, will go a long way toward helping you enjoy this series.The DVDsJust to start, according to The State's site, there were only three seasons on MTV, with the third being aired in two parts, but this set is broken up into four seasons. Considering the group was heavily involved with the discs, there's no reason to doubt this organization, but it is a bit weird. On the other hand, it made it easy to split the four seasons over four discs, with a fifth for more bonus material. The discs are held in a trio of black ThinPak cases, which are inside a loose-fitting slipcase that also holds a note from The State (explaining the music replacement (see The Quality for details,) and some promo inserts. The DVDs feature animated full-frame menus with options to play all the episodes, select shows, check out the bonus material and activate audio commentaries. There are no subtitles and no audio options, but closed captioning is available.The QualityThe episodes were remastered for re-release (on iTunes first and then on DVD) and the results are clear on these full-frame transfers, especially when you compare them to other shows from the early '90s. There's an odd inconsistency to the footage though, with some scenes looking like they were shot last week, with a clean image that sports bright, appropriate color and a good level of detail, while others look like home video I shot with my old Sears shoulder-mouth camcorder, with that distinct dull, soft look that only VHS does justice to. It's not even like you can compare in-studio to location shoots, as they vary in quality no matter where they were shot. No matter what you're looking at though, there's no obvious damage or compression artifacts, though there's a bit of blurring that's distracting, as copyrights are upheld on posters and such throughout the series.The audio is presented in pretty standard Dolby Digital 2.0 tracks that do a fine job of recreating the early-'90s basic cable sound of the series, with clean dialogue and clear music, though there's nothing dynamic about the mix.Now, about that music replacement... When the show aired, they were free to use a wide range of music due to deals MTV had with the major labels. So there were a lot of well-known music tracks throughout the series. Those deals didn't extend to video, so most of the music had to be replaced (""The Power"" by Snap somehow slid through.) It's frequent, but, as the updates were done with the cooperation of the troupe, the creator of the rocking theme, Craig Wedren of Shudder to Think, was brought in to do fill-in tracks, and he's done an excellent job of recreating the feel of the original songs. The most memorable example of music in the series is probably the iconic use of The Breeders' ""Cannonball"" in the classic ""Pants"" sketch, but it's imitated with some heavy bass use to good effect. It's not ideal, but as noted in the packaging, the cost of the music would have prevented the DVDs from being released, and some rights were simply not available to them. The only real down note is the removal of a link sketch where the cast sang part of a Pearl Jam song, but only the most hardcore fans will miss it or notice its absence.The Bottom LineIncredibly, The State remains truly hilarious, even with the dual demons of timeliness and music copyrights working against it, thanks to a fantastically funny gang of creators working with a relative level of freedom. After years of hoping by fans, a complete collection of episodes has finally arrived, and it looks and sounds very nice (despite many changed music cues), while packing some impressive extras to boot. Though the music and blurs are frustrating, I can't think of anything else I could ask for in this set, aside from the CBS special, which is likely a rights issue (though aren't they all Viacom now?) As such, I feel I have to give this the highest rating possible, if only for finally fulfilling the wishes of so many. It's a fantastic walk down memory lane for longtime fans, and a chance for a new generation of fans to dip their balls in The State.",5,I Wanna Dip My Balls In It!,1320192000,"11 2,

Although, just like every other diehard fan of this series, watching most of these classic sketches without the original music isn't easy to do.  I'm glad that the series is on DVD at any rate. I hope that in the future, MTV will shell out the cash and re-release this set with the original tracks.  I also hope that the CBS Halloween Special will also be released because it was arguably one of the State's greatest series of sketches.  With all of that said, any fan of the State or irreverent sketch comedy should rush to own these discs.",4,A Great Series from a Horrible Television Network,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,618,"['ask', 'State', 'greatest', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'series', 'ever', 'created', 'just', 'other', 'diehard', 'fan', 'series', 'watching', 'most', 'classic', 'sketches', 'original', 'music', ""n't"", 'easy', 'do', ""'m"", 'glad', 'series', 'DVD', 'rate', 'hope', 'future', 'MTV', 'will', 'shell', 'out', 'cash', 're-release', 'set', 'original', 'tracks', 'also', 'hope', 'CBS', 'Halloween', 'Special', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'released', 'was', 'arguably', 'one', 'State', 'greatest', 'series', 'sketches', 'said', 'fan', 'State', 'irreverent', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'should', 'rush', 'own', 'discs']",The State: The Complete Series
