Crabtree ""Doc Crabtree""","[1, 1]","Based on the true story of the Great Camel Experiment launched by the U.S. military just prior to the Civil War, Hawmps is a fun look at Army soldiers confronted by the &#34;ships of the desert.&#34; During this brief experiment camels turned out to be ideal for the environment found in the Great South-West Desert, the area which would someday include parts of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and Utah. What went wrong? Well, first of all the Secretary War who requested the experiment was Jefferson Davis and he would eventually go on to a bigger gig... President of the Confederacy. And Congress, which financed the project, was being torn apart by sectarian and political divisions.If not for that, camels might have become as familiar to outlaws like Jesse James and Billy the Kid as colt six-shooters.A light-hearted comedy, Hawmps is a good film.

It's pretty fun light hearted stuff, but this is one of the worst video transfer jobs I've ever seen.  I can barely read the opening text, I can barely make out some of the shapes, and the whole thing looks like its negative had been sitting in the sun for the last 30 some odd years.  Then again it's Good Times Video marketing the thing, and they're not exactly known for quality videos.  Both audio and visuals get a major thumbs down in this viewers book.
