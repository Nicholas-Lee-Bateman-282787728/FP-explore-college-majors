963066,A14N5L5T089VX3,B000DBHX4M,"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader""","[2, 2]","Lots of films with kids in lead roles feature inept dialog, bad acting, poor shooting and/or little or no plot, or are thinly disguised morality tales. Despite its not lighting up the Hollywood skies with box office success, Zathura is one of those rare and delightful exceptions that is really worth taking the time to see.The film starts out showing the belligerent behavior of a 10 year old boy towards his younger brother, and the 6 year old's response, during a front yard game of catch with their father. After Dad goes out for an errand, the 6 year old finds a ""space"" game in the basement - Zathura - and his older brother resentfully agrees to play it with him. It turns out that the game changes reality - as they learn when a meteor shower hits the living room, followed by the discovery that their house is now orbiting what appears to be a fiery planet.The boys overcome increasingly terrifying challenges as the movie progresses, learning to trust and love each other (and themselves) more and more, as they work to protect each other as each new catastrophe occurs.Their older sister joins in and learns to love and trust her younger siblings as well, though she doesn't have a significant role until the latter half of the film - a side effect of being cryogenically frozen by the game early-on (and the source of several humorous moments and sight gags during the course of the film).Without being ""preachy"", the film provides strong lessons on the value and importance of family, and of working together to solve problems.The performances of all of the actors are superb and very believable. The writing, direction and special effects are all excellent. Humorous moments and dialog, some of it REALLY funny, kept the audience laughing throughout the film, and helped to lighten things up in between some of the really intense scenes.This is a ""must-see"" film, right up there with the best children's films I've ever seen. Even so, due to the intensity, I would not recommend it for very young children (5-6 years of age or under), and some older pre-teens should probably see the film with an adult.Given that the film hits the mark in terms of quality, provides an excellent message of the importance of family, does a good job of reaching its intended audience, and treats them with respect, I'll give it 5 stars: good entertainment, and a ""must have"" for any parent's DVD collection.",5,Excellent Family Entertainment: hits the mark without being pompous or preachy,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,2404,"['Lots', 'films', 'kids', 'lead', 'roles', 'feature', 'inept', 'dialog', 'bad', 'acting', 'poor', 'shooting', 'and/or', 'little', 'plot', 'are', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'morality', 'tales', 'not', 'lighting', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'skies', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'Zathura', 'one', 'rare', 'delightful', 'exceptions', 'really', 'worth', 'taking', 'time', 'see.The', 'film', 'out', 'showing', 'belligerent', 'behavior', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'younger', 'brother', '6', 'year', 'old', 'response', 'front', 'yard', 'game', 'catch', 'father', 'Dad', 'out', 'errand', '6', 'year', 'old', 'space', 'game', 'basement', 'Zathura', 'older', 'brother', 'resentfully', 'play', 'out', 'game', 'reality', 'learn', 'when', 'meteor', 'shower', 'living', 'room', 'followed', 'discovery', 'house', 'now', 'orbiting', 'what', 'be', 'fiery', 'planet.The', 'boys', 'overcome', 'increasingly', 'terrifying', 'challenges', 'movie', 'learning', 'trust', 'love', 'other', 'more', 'more', 'work', 'protect', 'other', 'new', 'catastrophe', 'occurs.Their', 'older', 'sister', 'joins', 'learns', 'love', 'trust', 'younger', 'siblings', 'well', ""n't"", 'have', 'significant', 'role', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'side', 'effect', 'being', 'cryogenically', 'frozen', 'game', 'early-on', 'source', 'several', 'humorous', 'moments', 'sight', 'gags', 'course', 'film', 'being', 'preachy', 'film', 'strong', 'lessons', 'value', 'importance', 'family', 'working', 'together', 'solve', 'problems.The', 'performances', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'very', 'believable', 'writing', 'direction', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'Humorous', 'moments', 'dialog', 'REALLY', 'funny', 'kept', 'audience', 'laughing', 'film', 'helped', 'lighten', 'things', 'up', 'really', 'intense', 'scenes.This', 'must-see', 'film', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'children', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Even', 'so', 'due', 'intensity', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'very', 'young', 'children', '5-6', 'years', 'age', 'older', 'pre-teens', 'should', 'probably', 'see', 'film', 'adult.Given', 'film', 'mark', 'terms', 'quality', 'excellent', 'message', 'importance', 'family', 'good', 'job', 'reaching', 'intended', 'audience', 'respect', ""'ll"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'good', 'entertainment', 'must', 'have', 'parent', 'DVD', 'collection']",Zathura

The special effects are fantastic, and a plot twist or two make the movie more cerebrally stimulating than your average pre-teen adventure flick.Parents, be forewarned, though -- the main characters (two brothers, ages 10 and 6) spout a few mildly bad words and phrases that struck me as being ripe for parroting.

But Zathura is about 100 times better. First of all, the characters aren't overshadowed by 1) huge special effects and 2)big name actors who take over the movie. This is a movie with heart, and a great way to start the holiday season, I might add. Remember how surprisingly good the fun, holiday movie Elf was? This is like that, and both are directed by Jon Favreau. This film does a marvelous job of making an implausible situation seem plausible, while giving the characters some realness.Two young boys, Walter (age 10) and Danny (age 6) are constantly fighting. Danny just wants someone to play with. Walter could care less. Their father (played by Tim Robbins) is newly divorced, which only adds to this family's stress. There's also an older sister, Lisa, who sleeps until 2 pm and doesn't care about anyone but herself. When Danny finds a mysterious game in the basement called Zathura, he begs Walter to play. Walter doesn't feel like it, so Danny begins to play anyway. On his first spin, the game spits out a card that reads, ""Meteor Shower. Take evasive action."" Danny can't really read, and it's not until their living room is being pelleted with meteors that the boys take evasive action. Danny runs in circles screaming. Eventually, when the house if floating in the middle of space, they rescue a stranded astronaut (played wonderfully by Dax Shephard!), who reveals that he also once played the game and that's why he's a stranded astronaut. There's actually a twist in this movie about the astronaut, which I totally didn't see coming. I had to explain it to my little cousins because they didn't really get it, but they still thought it was cool.In the words of a three year old movie critic prodigy, this movie is ""really really cool, kinda scary, but really cool."" She even said it was better than Jumanji! And if you can't take my word for it, take hers. This is a very sweet movie that explores not only the far reaches of space, but the relationship that siblings have with one another.

Kids and adults alike will revel in this great story about two young brothers who find an old board-style game called Zathura that literally launches them and their home into outer-space. Danny and Walter are the brothers and when their father leaves them alone with their teenage sister for a few minutes, worlds collide and their home becomes a space-bound asteroid, but not because of any interstellar cataclysm. It's all related to the game Zathura that the younger Danny finds and begins playing.Their father's beautiful arts and crafts style home is magically transported to the nether reaches of space and as the boys play the game - in an attempt to get back to Earth - more and more bizarre occurrences happen. A meteor shower pummels the house. A defective robot tries to kill the elder brother, Walter. Zorgons, weird, space-faring lizard-men, track their home because of the warmth radiating off it. A stranded spaceman joins the duo and has much more vested in the game than we could ever imagine. Walter and Danny's sister goes into cryogenic sleep for ""five turns"" only to awaken in the midst of this spaceflight odyssey.Can the boys make it home? Will they be able to finish the game? Can they put aside their sibling rivalries and become loving brothers? Why is the stranded astronaut helping them? What will Dad say when he gets home and finds out there is no home?_______________________________________________________________________________________There's been a lot of controversial talk amongst film-o-philes about this movie and JUMANJI. There's no doubt that there's an incredibly strong similarity between the two (a house being overrun by animals versus space creatures; a family in crisis that's forced to come together; a board game that recreates a fantasy; a happy ending that gets fixed-up before adults arrive back in the picture; and so on).Regardless of those striking comparisons, Zathura is a really fun film to watch. The two brothers are believable, and when they fight it reminded me of the great arguments I had with my brothers when I was growing up.The amazingly beautiful arts and crafts home. It was painful watching it get destroyed piece by piece. Sitting on a gimbal, too, it was surprising (watching the special features on the DVD) to learn that director Jon Favreau used minimal digital special effects and built miniatures, etc. in order to get the desired effects for the film.The ridiculous nature of the story allowed me to suspend disbelief and just go with it. We all know that fire doesn't burn in outer-space (they light a sofa on fire and kick it out the door), and that a person could never survive fifteen years floating around in space in a spacesuit (the astronaut), but so what.I was also a tad surprised about the astronaut. I'd surmised quite a bit about the movie as it continued (being able to guess pretty easily what was going to happen next and why) but when the true nature of the stranded astronaut came to light, I felt a bit choked-up (yeah, yeah, I know).So sit back and enjoy the film, and try not to get overly critical about its obvious relation to JUMANJI.",4,Get Off Jumanji And Get On-Board With Zathura,1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,3188,"['Open', 'up', 'imagination', 'world', 'Zathura', 'Kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'will', 'revel', 'great', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'brothers', 'who', 'find', 'old', 'board-style', 'game', 'called', 'Zathura', 'literally', 'home', 'outer-space', 'Danny', 'Walter', 'are', 'brothers', 'when', 'father', 'alone', 'teenage', 'sister', 'few', 'minutes', 'worlds', 'collide', 'home', 'space-bound', 'asteroid', 'not', 'interstellar', 'cataclysm', 'all', 'related', 'game', 'Zathura', 'younger', 'Danny', 'finds', 'father', 'beautiful', 'arts', 'crafts', 'style', 'home', 'magically', 'transported', 'nether', 'space', 'boys', 'play', 'game', 'attempt', 'get', 'back', 'Earth', 'more', 'more', 'bizarre', 'occurrences', 'happen', 'meteor', 'shower', 'house', 'defective', 'robot', 'tries', 'kill', 'elder', 'brother', 'Walter', 'Zorgons', 'weird', 'space-faring', 'lizard-men', 'track', 'home', 'warmth', 'radiating', 'off', 'stranded', 'spaceman', 'duo', 'much', 'more', 'vested', 'game', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'Walter', 'Danny', 'sister', 'cryogenic', 'sleep', 'five', 'turns', 'only', 'awaken', 'midst', 'spaceflight', 'odyssey.Can', 'boys', 'make', 'home', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'finish', 'game', 'Can', 'put', 'aside', 'sibling', 'rivalries', 'become', 'loving', 'brothers', 'Why', 'stranded', 'astronaut', 'helping', 'What', 'will', 'Dad', 'say', 'when', 'home', 'out', 'home', 'been', 'lot', 'controversial', 'talk', 'film-o-philes', 'movie', 'JUMANJI', 'doubt', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'similarity', 'two', 'house', 'being', 'overrun', 'animals', 'versus', 'space', 'creatures', 'family', 'crisis', 'forced', 'come', 'together', 'board', 'game', 'fantasy', 'happy', 'ending', 'fixed-up', 'adults', 'arrive', 'back', 'picture', 'so', '.Regardless', 'striking', 'comparisons', 'Zathura', 'really', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'believable', 'when', 'fight', 'reminded', 'great', 'arguments', 'had', 'brothers', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up.The', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'arts', 'crafts', 'home', 'was', 'painful', 'watching', 'get', 'destroyed', 'piece', 'piece', 'Sitting', 'gimbal', 'too', 'was', 'surprising', 'watching', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'learn', 'director', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'used', 'minimal', 'digital', 'special', 'effects', 'built', 'miniatures', 'etc', 'order', 'get', 'desired', 'effects', 'film.The', 'ridiculous', 'nature', 'story', 'allowed', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'just', 'go', 'know', 'fire', ""n't"", 'burn', 'outer-space', 'light', 'sofa', 'fire', 'kick', 'out', 'door', 'person', 'could', 'never', 'survive', 'fifteen', 'years', 'floating', 'around', 'space', 'spacesuit', 'astronaut', 'so', 'what.I', 'was', 'also', 'tad', 'surprised', 'astronaut', ""'d"", 'surmised', 'quite', 'bit', 'movie', 'continued', 'being', 'able', 'guess', 'pretty', 'easily', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'why', 'when', 'true', 'nature', 'stranded', 'astronaut', 'came', 'light', 'felt', 'bit', 'choked-up', 'yeah', 'yeah', 'know', '.So', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'film', 'try', 'not', 'get', 'overly', 'critical', 'obvious', 'relation', 'JUMANJI']",Zathura

The plot of the film is that two brothers begin playing, and find themselves in outer space, beseiged by all manners of spaceborne things from meteorites to alien lizards. There are several good messages that the film gets across, like 'try to get along with your brothers and sisters'. These ideas aren't really pushed in your face, but they're pretty obvious, nonetheless. This is one of the things I liked about it. I enjoy films that are geared toward kids that contain positive messages - they get too few of them these days.The special effects were great, the acting was very good for a movie filled with child actors, and the action sequences were okay for even younger kids to watch.

One such film was ""Jumanji"" where the special effects have aged considerably since its release but the charm and even spectacle of it all makes it better even while you might scoff many times. Well essentially we have that movie set in space with this film, a ""Jumanji: The Galaxy Edition"" if you will, and while the similarities are quite obvious and the effects have gotten better, it still feels to familiar though kids might have a blast with it.Walter and Danny are 2 brothers dealing with their parent's divorce and father's working. Walter wants attention from his dad to play catch and wants nothing to do with his brother while Danny just wants his brother to play with him. But with dad gone and sister upstairs sleeping, they learn to work together when Danny finds a board game called ""Zathura"" that brings with it meteor showers and the house flying through space complete with strange and dangerous events every time one takes a turn.Yeah, you can see the parellels to Jumanji already huh? The board game, reading the next event (off a card instead of a glass center, the dealings with a cheater and someone who escapes from the game because of a roll, sorry...button press) and if you remember what happens when someone wins the board game in the other one well you can tell what's in this one. But aside from the similarities, the problem is the film is kind of - but not all the time - irritating, mainly due to the brother's. They spent so much time bickering and arguing that Tim Robbin's exasperation early on doesn't seem like an overreaction at all. While there's lots to ogle at, the characters themselves just don't have a lot of appeal.However, the film certainly looks great to look at with an early meteor shower, an encounter to close to a star and the end sequence being highlights. Since a good chunk of it was done without just going straight to the computers was everything is welcome. The acting when it's not being grating, works and looking at Kristen Stewart any chance I can made the film better but the lack of suspense throughout the whole film and just being little mini-episodes till the end hurts and the ""villain"" doesn't have a real sense of threat Jonathan Hyde brought to Jumanji. But I'm nitpicking and I certainly don't want to seem like I'm making that film to be perfectly awesome but when compared to this one, what it lacks in effects makes up for it in key areas.I'd recommend Zathura since ultimately it is a family movie and such criticisms tend to get thrown out the door when you watch but when you start really watching, then stuff gets noticed.

If you've seen and enjoyed Jumanji you'll probably enjoy Zathura.Both are generally based on children's adventure stories of the same names by Chris Van Allsberg. The book version of Jumanji was published in 1981 while the book version of Zathura was published in 2002.Both movies involve the discovery of powerful games which seem to change the reality in which the players live. In Zathura the adventures take place in space and involve the dangers offered by space as well as alien life forms who want to eat the players. There are also some plot surprises which lend a little mystery to the story.Zathura is good family fun and provides a pleasant evening's entertainment for all ages.

963094,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000DBHX4M,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","ZATHURA (Dir. Jon Favreau, 2005, 113 minutes) was first and foremost a starring vehicle for a very young Josh Hutcherson (Walter) and his co-star Jonah Bobo (Dan). Walter is 10 (but Hutcherson was already 13) and Dan is 6 (but Bobo was actually 8 at the time), and yes, this is a JUMANJI-related film and is based on the book by the same author who gave usJumanji.Set in beautiful Culver City, California, we can easily assume without seeing this that the kids discover a creepy board game. It's a cheesy 1950s-looking space adventure called ""Zathura"". And yes, they start to play and the game swallows them up--they have to play it all to the end to 'get back home'. But wait! Don't let that or the horrible JUMANJI put you off!This is no JUMANJI in my opinion--it is supremely funny. That is what it is: a comedy and one of the highest caliber I have ever enjoyed. Hutcherson and Bobo are the funniest pair onscreen since Laurel and Hardy. It is this wonderful, natural comedic genius and the charm they display that carries the entire film.Tim Robbins, who plays the boys' overworked father, is really put to shame by the kids' performances. He does his best but I saw that he simply did not click with the kids. It was good that he was mostly in a cameo role and then wasn't much to be seen after that.The surprise I had, since I never saw this before, was seeing the odious Kirsten Stewart (ofTwilight Forever: The Complete Saga Box Set [DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy)fame undeserved) as the boys' older sister. Happily, she is cryogenically frozen early in the film and I loved seeing her frozen little self being bumped around the house.And yes, it is necessary to state for the dum-dums of the world: most of the film has a DUMMY of Kirsten Stewart. That is not her actual body thumping down the steps, so please don't tell me what a great actress she is for acting frozen. Her acting is already pretty frozen as it is!The kids are so funny, the lines so classic and delivered with an old man's precision, that this does deserve to be in any DVD collection. Aside from an early vehicle for Kirsten Stewart--who looks exactly the same as she does now--as well as Josh Hutcherson, this is worth it for the dialogue alone. Just don't expect profundity or deep emotional investments.After all, this is a family-popcorn-comedy, but I have rarely seen a comedy so successfully and completely carried by two young children. And now the younger kid is a successful TV-star teen, while the other is an extremely hot film commodity (and in general just an extremely hot young man whom I suspect will be coming out of the closet very soon).For detail/degrees-of-removal buffs, I also note as a matter of trivia that Robin Williams, who starred in JUMANJI, also starred as Josh Hutcherson's father inRV--and RV was the 1st time I ever saw Hutcherson. See my review of RV, as a matter of interest because RV was an early attempt to reanimate Robin Williams' dying film career. The one thing it surefootedly did was attract the public eye to Hutcherson and he has not disappointed yet.",5,Comedy at its best: skilled kids,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,3080,"['ZATHURA', 'Dir', 'Jon', 'Favreau', '2005', '113', 'minutes', 'was', 'first', 'foremost', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'very', 'young', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Walter', 'co-star', 'Jonah', 'Bobo', 'Dan', 'Walter', '10', 'Hutcherson', 'was', 'already', '13', 'Dan', '6', 'Bobo', 'was', 'actually', '8', 'time', 'yes', 'JUMANJI-related', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'author', 'who', 'gave', 'usJumanji.Set', 'beautiful', 'Culver', 'City', 'California', 'can', 'easily', 'assume', 'seeing', 'kids', 'discover', 'creepy', 'board', 'game', 'cheesy', '1950s-looking', 'space', 'adventure', 'called', 'Zathura', 'yes', 'start', 'play', 'game', 'up', 'have', 'play', 'end', ""'get"", 'back', 'home', 'wait', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'horrible', 'JUMANJI', 'put', 'off', 'JUMANJI', 'opinion', 'supremely', 'funny', 'what', 'comedy', 'one', 'highest', 'caliber', 'have', 'ever', 'enjoyed', 'Hutcherson', 'Bobo', 'are', 'funniest', 'pair', 'onscreen', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'wonderful', 'natural', 'comedic', 'genius', 'charm', 'display', 'entire', 'film.Tim', 'Robbins', 'who', 'boys', 'overworked', 'father', 'really', 'put', 'shame', 'kids', 'performances', 'best', 'saw', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'click', 'kids', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'mostly', 'cameo', 'role', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'be', 'seen', 'that.The', 'surprise', 'had', 'never', 'saw', 'was', 'seeing', 'odious', 'Kirsten', 'Stewart', 'ofTwilight', 'Forever', 'Complete', 'Saga', 'Box', 'Set', '[', 'DVD', '+', 'UltraViolet', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'fame', 'undeserved', 'boys', 'older', 'sister', 'Happily', 'cryogenically', 'frozen', 'early', 'film', 'loved', 'seeing', 'frozen', 'little', 'self', 'being', 'bumped', 'house.And', 'yes', 'necessary', 'state', 'dum-dums', 'world', 'most', 'film', 'DUMMY', 'Kirsten', 'Stewart', 'not', 'actual', 'body', 'thumping', 'down', 'steps', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'great', 'actress', 'acting', 'frozen', 'acting', 'already', 'pretty', 'frozen', 'kids', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'lines', 'so', 'classic', 'delivered', 'old', 'man', 'precision', 'deserve', 'be', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Aside', 'early', 'vehicle', 'Kirsten', 'Stewart', 'who', 'exactly', 'same', 'now', 'as', 'well', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'worth', 'dialogue', 'alone', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'profundity', 'deep', 'emotional', 'investments.After', 'family-popcorn-comedy', 'have', 'rarely', 'seen', 'comedy', 'so', 'successfully', 'completely', 'carried', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'now', 'younger', 'kid', 'successful', 'TV-star', 'teen', 'other', 'extremely', 'hot', 'film', 'commodity', 'general', 'just', 'extremely', 'hot', 'young', 'man', 'whom', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'closet', 'very', 'soon', 'detail/degrees-of-removal', 'buffs', 'also', 'note', 'matter', 'trivia', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'starred', 'JUMANJI', 'also', 'starred', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'father', 'inRV', 'RV', 'was', '1st', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'Hutcherson', 'See', 'review', 'RV', 'matter', 'interest', 'RV', 'was', 'early', 'attempt', 'reanimate', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'dying', 'film', 'career', 'one', 'thing', 'surefootedly', 'did', 'was', 'attract', 'public', 'eye', 'Hutcherson', 'not', 'disappointed', 'yet']",Zathura
963095,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B000DBHX4M,Eric J. Anderson,"[8, 12]","I love a good kids film. Often I like them better than films aimed exclusively at adults. There is less objectionable material. Plots are not convoluted. Often there is genuine sentiment, and a moral to the story. What I do not enjoy is the increasing tendency of movies for kids to rely on kinetic energy (or wild special effects) as a substitute for good writing and acting. I think that is part of what happened with Zathura.Zathura is a movie like Jumanji -- where kids start playing a board game (called Zathura, naturally) and they enter an alternate reality -- the world of the game made real. They have to finish the game to get back to the normal world.The acting isn't very good. Haley Joel Osment and Dakota Fanning have raised the bar so high now that what used to be a passable job of acting for a child now looks silly and amateurish. I got bored about halfway through and started fast forwarding furiously to the end.Zathura is supposed to have a ""moral,"" but that aspect is so ham-handedly written and acted that it almost seems pasted on.The game involves a series of challenges and threats, as the children journey to outer space and confront robots and lizard aliens and friendly stranded astronouts. It is mostly a succession of strange things (involving expensive special effects photography) happening every time a kid takes a turn at the game. The kids then react badly (or badly act) in fright and stumble their way through until the game ends.I don't know why this movie was made. The only thing it has going for it is a lot of action whenever the game play results in peril. In between the peril, the dialogue is dull.There are so many great kids movies, or even mediocre kid's movies, better than this -- almost any of the animated classics directed by Hayao Miyazaki, or Secondhand Lions. I kind of enjoyed Holes, and The Sandlot, too. The old My Bodyguard. The Incredibles was very entertaining.I don't know how the kiddies reacted to Zathura, but it seems like a waste of time to me.

963098,A3KGBMSG9ASVL,B000DBHX4M,Gozer,"[2, 2]","Like Joe Dante, who directed the 1985 sci-fi flick ""Explorers,"" John Favreau understands exactly what it is about sci-fi that tickles the imaginations of kids. Both directors ground their adventures in the familiar setting of home -- a neighborhood, a house -- and both directors show a talent for remembering what it's like to be a kid in awe, presenting everything from the point of view of the boys as they stumble through unlikely space adventures.This movie is perfectly paced, the kids play their parts with convincing emotion and the dialogue is often hilarious. Zathura is a movie about a magical board game that brings aliens and space ships to life, but it's also about siblings pulling together and discovering their love for each other even if they don't always get along.There are very funny moments here, like one scene that plays on the absurdity of an astronaut who lands on a house floating in space and still offers the courtesy of ringing the doorbell. The comedic timing is absolutely perfect. But there are also warm scenes, showing what another reviewer described as ""a movie with a heart,"" which is a great way to put it.Favreau makes it just as easy for adults to feel the same thrill at the prospect of a space adventure as the younger audience. And like Joe Dante, who paid homage to the sci-fi classics of the 50s with ""Explorers,"" Favreau gives those films a nod visually with the retro ships of the alien villians and a malicious robot that's straight out of early comic books.This was a great release for the Christmas season and I could see it becoming a seasonal classic for families. I caught this movie with my brother -- we're both in our 20s -- and my mom during a week when my brother was on a rare leave from an overseas military station, and it was a great way to spend a family afternoon.

We do know  Chris Van Allsburg wrote both the picture books, and the premise of both films are similar. But while Jumanji was also kid-friendly, Robin Williams still took something away from the kids' performances. Here, not being saddled with a star actor - who hogs all the screen time -  the focus in Zathura is squarely on the two child stars who play the contentious siblings, and the film is generous with its portrayal of their rivalrous relationship, as well as their fantastic, out of this world adventures.Walter and Danny are two young, neglected brothers (10 & 6 years old respectively) who are going thru that normal stage of sibling rivalry. They have an older sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart) who sleeps all day and who doesn't take her babysitting duties seriously, and a divorced father (Tim Robbins) who one week-end afternoon leaves them alone in their ""creepy, old house"" to go to work. In the midst of their usual shenanigans, Danny ends up in the scary basement and chances upon an old board game called Zathura. When Walter refuses to join him in play, Danny winds the key on the board and begins playing anyway - and, the next second, the children are frantically taking ""evasive action"" against an in-house meteor shower. And that's only the beginning!Suddenly, their house is floating in space, their sister is in a cryonic sleep, and a maniacal robot, an astronaut, and ravenous reptilian space aliens become unexpected visitors. The only way to get home seems to be to keep playing the game, but with every turn, the danger deepens, as well as the boys' mutual dislike. Will Walter and Danny ever get home? Will the spaceman ever get home? Will their sister ever wake up?Zathura has a total ensemble of 5 actors, and you really don't need any more to make the film work. Josh Hutcherson (Walter) and Jonah Bobo (Danny) are the two main protagonists and they prove to be capable young actors. They are ably bolstered by veteran actor Tim Robbins and also by Dax Shepard, who has a nice turn as the stranded astronaut. Kristen Stewart, meanwhile, does a great job as the frozen popsickle.With an interesting, magical premise, flawless special effects (that robot was a trip), skillful direction by Jon Favreau, and a nice albeit predictable twist near the end, an adult can certainly find something to like here (I certainly did). But this film is firmly targeted for our young audience. And, as such, Zathura is quickly paced, highly energetic and wholesome enough (there are some mild profanity uttered by the kids). Younger children under 5 or 6 years old might find the movie experience too intense, but older kids should get a kick out of the outrageous and sometimes intense perils, the amazing set designs, and the cool robot and aliens.

I expected Michael, as someone who's been exposed to a steady diet of Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, and Spider-Man, as well as to Peanuts, the Wiggles and the Muppets, to enjoy the sci-fi elements.  Predictably, he spent the second half of the film cowering in his seat, latched onto both of my arms... and he walked out of the theater at the end loving every minute of it, completely jazzed about the experience.  We spent most of the 10-minute walk back talking about outer space, aliens, and how it was all fiction, and he drew a lot of pictures of aliens (most of whom looked like Muppets) once he got home.As others here have said, the language used by the two boys in the movie (10 and 7) is a little disconcerting.  However, they use the same words I was exposed to at that age, and comparable to the language Michael is exposed to at home.  Michael didn't walk out of the theater cursing, so that part of the movie did not bother me.The scare factor is somewhat intense.  The predictable monsters don't show up until the final two reels and aren't what I'd call terrifying, although that's the part of the movie that had Michael cowering.  There's also a big clunky '50s-style robot, but when you find out who provides the voice you'll realize that this wasn't meant to be terrifying -- not if anything to say about it Jon Favreau had.  The images of the house floating through space, alongside asteroids and suns, is what will really stand out for the younger viewer.This is basically a kids' movie directed by Jon Favreau, so naturally it's going to seem odd.  Based on the uncomfortably short shorts worn by the teenage girl in the movie (and she has nothing else to do at all), I'd say the target audience is boys 9 to 12.  There's also a surprisingly deep plot twist involving another game player that the boys meet as their house drifts through space.  I had trouble explaining that to my nephew, although his grandmother didn't understand it either.My final verdict is that it's safe to take a smaller child (6-ish) to this movie, and they will not take anything negative away from the experience.

963112,A2XA0P02QNFA38,B000DBHX4M,"Joeomar ""joeomar""","[1, 2]","In 1995 the movie ""Jumanji"" came out, based on a story by Chris Van Allsburg about two children playing a board game that came to life.  When it became fairly successful, another short story of Van Allsburg in the same theme was turned into a movie.  This was ""Zathura"".  Whereas the Jumanji game centered around an African jungle safari, the setting of Zathura was rocket ships in outer space.  Despite the nature of the board game, the movie ""Zathura"" is of the ""fantasy"" genre, not science fiction; the idea of children being magically transported into the universe of a board game is fantasy, and the universe depicted is a fantasized version of outer space that isn't intended to match reality (more on that later).  Zathura was generally well-received by critics but tanked at the box office.  However, despite the lack of success or of the star-power names its predecessor had, Zathura is actually the better movie.  It is less pretentious than Jumanji, and similar to Pixar movies is packaged with a nice little moral (in this case regarding sibling rivalry) that is not horribly overdone.  It also has surprisingly good special effects, much better than Jumanji's.  The ""Zathura"" board game that the children find has a graphic style that looks like the covers of 1950's science-fiction pulp magazines.  When the boys get launched into ""outer space"", instead of making the environment look like a REAL spaceflight the movie brings the campy 1950s-look of the board game to life and makes it quite realistic.  ""Sibling rivalry"" was a prophetic theme for this movie, considering its older brother was a successful movie whereas this one sank in the theaters without making a ripple.

It's very creative, much like Jumanji.BUT Hollywood's nearly 100% tendency to fill its ""kids"" movies with nasty brats and dysfunctional families ruins this film.  They really push the envelope here.  The jerky older brother (played irritatingly by Josh Hutcherson) gets so obnoxious that I end up not caring about his poor misunderstood childhood and want him to get eaten by the Zorgons (alien lizards).  He treats his little brother like dirt and casually disregards everything that any adult tells him to do.  His sister is likewise pushing-the-envelope obnoxious, but thankfully is asleep for 1/3 the film and gets frozen for another 1/3.  The only ""likeable"" character is the little brother played by Jonah Bobo, who is the stereotypical Hollywood little-kid (precocious, long hair), but he also tends to disregard what adults say in a very irritating fashion.Of course there is maximum havoc and just as you think that all is lost (in space), everyone comes home safe-and-sound before the patsy Dad comes home.  The big plot twist is how an astronaut boards their spacecraft home and surprise! turns out to be the older brother from the future.But about the only significant thing that I recall from thinking about watching this movie is the extreme obnoxiousness of the Hollywood family.  I seem to remember the older brother callously calling his little brother ""BEEYOTCH,"" which makes you want to reach through the screen and slap him on his head.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[6, 8]","Zathura is pretty good and it's a movie that will definitely keep most kids entertained thanks to the wacky characters and special effects. Its back-story is exactly like Van Allsburg's first book turned film Jumanji but the acting isn't as solid. So now you know it's just like Jumanji, so you know that two kids basically start to play a game and somehow someway they're thrown into the game and everything that the game says will happen actually happens. As a person who already saw Jumanji and I'm sure everyone in the world has too seeing as Jumanji's videotape stays in every classroom I've ever been in, I should only have to explain the quality of Zathura. These kids are a little too old for their own good, and they push the PG rating as far they can. Older brother Walter has one dirty mouth so if your child still has virgin ears you may want to watch out for that.Though this story is much like Jumanji Van Allsburg still does a nice job of delivering a different set of characters and ending with a moral that will have siblings hugging each other. The ending is very predictable but if a kid is watching he/she probably won't even notice because the explosive action and fat aliens will catch most of their attention. If you are watching a movie like this with your children you can always stretch a little fib at the end and say ""see this will happen if you keep being mean to your brother"". Zathura is not really trying to come across as a children's classic or an original work but it is a nice family movie though that PG rating is used to the fullest. Walter is funny when he says it but it's not really needed.

963122,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B000DBHX4M,Kevin J. Loria,"[6, 8]","Zathura propels the audience and two squabbling siblings into deep space while playing a mysterious board game. The live-action film is based on Chris Van Allsburg's 2002 follow-up to his award-winning Jumanji. Brothers Danny and Walter's combative relationship is established immediately along with a four-letter word, which is more jarring given the young age of the film's target audience. Zathura is rated PG, but considering the overall family tone of the film, the line is awkward at best. Tim Robbins plays the inefficient dad who appears only long enough to leave Danny and Walter in the problematic care of the sleeping older sister.  After this not-entirely, unnecessary, initial exposition the movie is remarkably fast-paced leaving little need to think too hard about the physics or lackthereof. One cool effect is followed another as the brothers take their turns to make matters worse, one card after the next, just like Jumanji and its movie adaptation.  And like Jumanji there is an adult who shows up in the form of an astronaut, played by Dax Shephard, to help end the game before the house is entirely wrecked by the barrage of black holes and bad robots. The astronauts presence, not only gives the parents a character to connect too, but creates a much more interesting dynamic between the brothers. The game itself is nicely sci-fi retro, as are the sci-fi scenarios, the art direction and the music.A mostly harmless family film which looks as pretty as Chris Van Allsburg's artwork (too bad he didn't add color to HIS Zathura).Watch for the ""Citizen Kane"" homage in the alien ship.",3,"a Very Pretty, Fast-paced, MOSTLY HARMLESS family film",1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,1605,"['Zathura', 'audience', 'two', 'squabbling', 'siblings', 'deep', 'space', 'playing', 'mysterious', 'board', 'game', 'live-action', 'film', 'based', 'Chris', 'Van', 'Allsburg', '2002', 'follow-up', 'award-winning', 'Jumanji', 'Brothers', 'Danny', 'Walter', 'combative', 'relationship', 'established', 'immediately', 'four-letter', 'word', 'more', 'jarring', 'given', 'young', 'age', 'film', 'target', 'audience', 'Zathura', 'rated', 'PG', 'considering', 'overall', 'family', 'tone', 'film', 'line', 'awkward', 'best', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'inefficient', 'dad', 'who', 'only', 'long', 'enough', 'leave', 'Danny', 'Walter', 'problematic', 'care', 'sleeping', 'older', 'sister', 'not-entirely', 'unnecessary', 'initial', 'exposition', 'movie', 'remarkably', 'fast-paced', 'leaving', 'little', 'need', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'physics', 'lackthereof', 'One', 'cool', 'effect', 'followed', 'brothers', 'take', 'turns', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'one', 'card', 'next', 'just', 'Jumanji', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Jumanji', 'adult', 'who', 'up', 'form', 'astronaut', 'played', 'Dax', 'Shephard', 'help', 'end', 'game', 'house', 'entirely', 'wrecked', 'barrage', 'black', 'holes', 'bad', 'robots', 'astronauts', 'presence', 'not', 'only', 'parents', 'character', 'connect', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'dynamic', 'brothers', 'game', 'nicely', 'sci-fi', 'retro', 'are', 'sci-fi', 'scenarios', 'art', 'direction', 'music.A', 'mostly', 'harmless', 'family', 'film', 'as', 'pretty', 'Chris', 'Van', 'Allsburg', 'artwork', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'color', 'HIS', 'Zathura', '.Watch', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'homage', 'alien', 'ship']",Zathura
963123,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B000DBHX4M,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[2, 3]","I like the movie ""Jumanji."" I don't think it's a great film, but it was a fairly decent movie. The special effects haven't held up quite as well as they used to, but that's okay, that's just the way things work sometimes. With that in mind, I wasn't particularly looking forward to seeing ""Zathura."" Like ""Elf,"" the movie just looked too dopy and childish for me. However, like ""Elf,"" I walked away from ""Zathura"" quite surprised. I only then learned that the guy who directed ""Elf"" directed ""Zathura"" too.The storyline is simple: Boys who hate each other find board game, start playing, weird stuff happens, boys must learn to love each other if they are to survive. In this regard, ""Zathura"" is nothing special, as this story has been told multiple times before. What makes this movie worth seeing is that it is told in a very fun way. While ""Jumanji"" was a good movie, calling it a family film (and giving the film it's too flexible PG rating) was a joke, as that film was capable of terrifying kids. ""Zathura"" makes this a fun ride by establishing very early on that this is going to be a fun fantasy ride.The first thing that happens is a huge meteor shower takes place in the living room. The meteors fall everywhere, destroying the room, but the kids are unharmed. So while it looks like the kids are avoiding the meteors, it's really the meteors that are avoiding the kids. This scene does a great job in setting up the fact that this is all just going to be fun. As more disasters show up, there is always something to protect the kids, and (in a brilliant stroke of genius) some of the special effects are old fashioned. The old fashioned special effects (like the robot) helps establish the fantasy setting we are in.The actors all do a commendable job in the movie. There is no Oscar work to be found here, but what is in here works. Save for Tim Robbins in a very minor supporting role as the dad who doesn't have for his kids, the cast is made up entirely of unknowns. This is also okay, as we don't want anyone mistaking this movie for art. Still, it's a great family film, and even if you don't have kids it is quite and enjoyable ride in itself.

I say that for two reasons:  1)The story is sort of dull, even with a huge ""gee-whiz"" factor going for it and, 2)It's no surprise that liberal lug Tim Robbins raises two potty-mouthed kids in this film.  If you have children, I'd wait until they're at least eight before letting them watch this film due to the fact that the two kiddie leads have some pretty rough mouths and there are a few sequences that can get pretty scary for young'uns.The reason that this seems familiar is that it's written by the same guy who wrote ""Jumanji.""  I liked this story much better when it was ""Jumanji.""  It's as if writer Chris Van Allsburg decided that ""Hey, it worked with jungle creatures, why not outerspace?""  This film is almost an exact carbon copy of ""Jumanji,"" all the way down to a regretful former player of the game trapped within it.  The only thing missing is the huge patrol car-eating vines.So, with that said, I'm sure any child between the ages of eight and twelve will love this film.  However, if you want to give them a real treat, let them watch ""Jumanji"" first and then have them compare the two.

963125,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000DBHX4M,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 2]","Ten years after Jumanji (1995) the idea of a board game reanimating itself by reemerging in the refurbished space cadet version called Zathura comes to life.  The idea of reusing the idea initially seems clich&eacute;d, especially when it comes from the same source, as Chris Van Allsburg wrote both stories.  Initially, I also thought that director Jon Favreau had run out of ideas, as he had to give the concept a face-lift.  Regardless of what Favreau thought, it will undoubtedly hurt the films novelty.  However, the film still succeeds in bringing forth a terrific tale of forgiveness, family, and hope for the whole family.The six-year-old Danny (Jonah Bobo) often finds himself being far less skilled in several activities common for children than his slightly older brothers Walter (Josh Hutcherson).  Danny's skill discrepancy has become a major issue in his life and has brought on low self-esteem, as his brother exploits the situation by showing off.  Their father, performed by Tim Robbins, tries to balance his attention equally among them, work, deadlines, and the time they do not live with their mother.  It is a difficult job for him while trying to provide the best possible home for them.  Nonetheless, Danny finds himself physically and emotionally bullied by Walter, as he most of the time finds him annoying.  Yet, they spend a lot of time together, which forces Walter to pay attention to Danny and play with him.  On occasion they are left on their own, as they are in this story when their father has return to work and leaves them under their older sister's supervision.  However, she is far too self-centered and focuses most on getting her beauty sleep.After one of the sibling's skirmishes, Walter sends Danny to the basement where he discovers an old board game called Zathura.  Danny brings the game to the living room where he wants to play the game with his brother, but Walter is completely uninterested.  Without anyone to play with, Danny opens and begins to play by himself, awe how the game initially operates.  After his piece has moved by some old fashion machinery inside the game, a card materializes out of the game.  The card says, ""METEOR SHOWER.  Take evasive action.""  Unaware what he activated, Danny seeks shelter together with his brother, as the living room is bombarded by small burning meteors that cut through the room like rocks through air.  In shock, the two brothers begin to realize what has just happened, as they must now finish what Danny has set in motion.It sends Danny and Walter on an amazing journey where they are about to test their affection and caring for one another.  The dangers that emerge could have costly consequences, but with the right decisions they might just get through the perilous adventure of the Zathura game.  Throughout the story, the audience will learn several valuable lessons of forgiveness, understanding, and compassion among others.  What is even more intriguing is that the story is told through the eyes of a child, which enhances its fascination for the younger viewers.  Furthermore, the hazardous events in the film bring about an adult and childish atmosphere at the same time, which undoubtedly further children's interest to the story.  In retrospect, Zathura might present an already used idea, but the story is far more elaborated than Jumanji.  It makes me wish that this were the first time I saw the concept, which might have made me love this already terrific science fiction tale even more.Jon Favreau truly loves his calling, and Zathura radiates this throughout the whole film.  However, the reuse of the coming alive board game from Jumanji hurts the overall cinematic experience, yet it is still a wonderful tale with suspense, drama, and entertainment for all ages.  In essence, Zathura is a definitely a film I would strongly recommend to younger viewers and for older people to see in order to find their younger selves once again.",4,Terrific Sci-Fi Tale Despite the Recycling of Old Concept...,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,3952,"['Ten', 'years', 'Jumanji', '1995', 'idea', 'board', 'game', 'reanimating', 'reemerging', 'refurbished', 'space', 'cadet', 'version', 'called', 'Zathura', 'life', 'idea', 'reusing', 'idea', 'initially', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'especially', 'when', 'same', 'source', 'Chris', 'Van', 'Allsburg', 'wrote', 'stories', 'Initially', 'also', 'thought', 'director', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'had', 'run', 'ideas', 'had', 'give', 'concept', 'face-lift', 'Regardless', 'what', 'Favreau', 'thought', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'hurt', 'films', 'novelty', 'However', 'film', 'still', 'bringing', 'forth', 'terrific', 'tale', 'forgiveness', 'family', 'hope', 'whole', 'family.The', 'six-year-old', 'Danny', 'Jonah', 'Bobo', 'often', 'being', 'far', 'less', 'skilled', 'several', 'activities', 'common', 'children', 'slightly', 'older', 'brothers', 'Walter', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Danny', 'skill', 'discrepancy', 'become', 'major', 'issue', 'life', 'brought', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'brother', 'situation', 'showing', 'off', 'father', 'performed', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'balance', 'attention', 'equally', 'work', 'deadlines', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'mother', 'difficult', 'job', 'trying', 'provide', 'best', 'possible', 'home', 'Nonetheless', 'Danny', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'bullied', 'Walter', 'most', 'time', 'annoying', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'together', 'Walter', 'pay', 'attention', 'Danny', 'play', 'occasion', 'are', 'left', 'own', 'are', 'story', 'when', 'father', 'return', 'work', 'older', 'sister', 'supervision', 'However', 'far', 'too', 'self-centered', 'most', 'getting', 'beauty', 'sleep.After', 'one', 'sibling', 'skirmishes', 'Walter', 'Danny', 'basement', 'where', 'old', 'board', 'game', 'called', 'Zathura', 'Danny', 'game', 'living', 'room', 'where', 'play', 'game', 'brother', 'Walter', 'completely', 'uninterested', 'anyone', 'play', 'Danny', 'play', 'awe', 'how', 'game', 'initially', 'piece', 'moved', 'old', 'fashion', 'machinery', 'game', 'card', 'game', 'card', 'METEOR', 'SHOWER', 'Take', 'evasive', 'action', 'what', 'activated', 'Danny', 'shelter', 'together', 'brother', 'living', 'room', 'bombarded', 'small', 'burning', 'meteors', 'cut', 'room', 'rocks', 'air', 'shock', 'two', 'brothers', 'begin', 'realize', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'must', 'now', 'finish', 'what', 'Danny', 'set', 'motion.It', 'sends', 'Danny', 'Walter', 'amazing', 'journey', 'where', 'are', 'test', 'affection', 'caring', 'one', 'dangers', 'emerge', 'could', 'have', 'costly', 'consequences', 'right', 'decisions', 'might', 'just', 'get', 'perilous', 'adventure', 'Zathura', 'game', 'story', 'audience', 'will', 'learn', 'several', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'forgiveness', 'understanding', 'compassion', 'others', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'intriguing', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'child', 'fascination', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Furthermore', 'hazardous', 'events', 'film', 'bring', 'adult', 'childish', 'atmosphere', 'same', 'time', 'undoubtedly', 'further', 'children', 'interest', 'story', 'retrospect', 'Zathura', 'might', 'present', 'already', 'used', 'idea', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'elaborated', 'Jumanji', 'wish', 'were', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'concept', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'love', 'already', 'terrific', 'science', 'fiction', 'tale', 'even', 'more.Jon', 'Favreau', 'truly', 'calling', 'Zathura', 'whole', 'film', 'However', 'reuse', 'coming', 'alive', 'board', 'game', 'Jumanji', 'overall', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'still', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'suspense', 'drama', 'entertainment', 'ages', 'essence', 'Zathura', 'definitely', 'film', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'younger', 'viewers', 'older', 'people', 'see', 'order', 'find', 'younger', 'selves', 'once', 'again']",Zathura
963126,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B000DBHX4M,K. Ostrowski,"[1, 3]","I hadn't even been conceived back in 1959.  That was about when my mom was still in school.  Nonetheless, I sat down during my teenage years every afternoon after school to watch the episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" I'd taped the night before (via timer) off the sci-fi channel, because I loved the formula.  That formula?  Suspension of disbelieve = 1.By this I mean that the audience will only really have to suspend their disbelief for one thing.  One element.  One plot point that dominates the episode later.  One thing alone about the world you're about to be vaulted into is different or unnatural.The same was true of Jumanji.  Basically, there is a board game (presumably a cursed board game, as it weilds magic against the gamers,) that you must play to the end, or else its ""interesting effects"" will never go away.Of course, Jumanji took those effects from a fictitious jungle environment, more dangerous than any jungle on earth, but Zathura is a slightly different kind of game.  This one is a space exploration game, and starting the game vaults anyone who plays it, along with, presumably, everything in their immediate vicinity, into the spaceborne world of Zathura.  The long and short is that two quarreling brothers start playing the game and find themselves and their house stranded in outer space.Now, I've seen many good reviews for this movie, and I'm sorry mine must be so... harsh, but I didn't enjoy Zathura as much as I enjoyed Jumanji for one reason above all others.That reason is that frankly, the scriptwriting stunk.I'm not talking about the dialogue between the boys or the dialogue of their father or their sister, or some of the dialogue of the mysterious astronaut, who appears later on.  Much of the dialogue was actually very realistic, which is more than can be said for most kids movies.  Problems seem to have only arisen in dialogue when it pertains to the game and its effects, which occur more and more frequently as the movie progresses.For one thing, the behavior of children when vaulted into outer space by a mad board game would be considerably different than what is shown in this movie.  In Jumanji, the behaviors of the kids (and adults) playing the game was actually quite realistic.  The girl who plays the game of Jumanji reacts realistically to the game's warning with an ""un-oh.  I didn't see this part.""  Then from then on, the kids realize that it is of the utmost importance that one of them finish the game if they want to be rid of the horrible dangers it's been visiting upon them.In this movie, the very real, life-threatening dangers are put on the back burner in the children's minds, as their conflicts with one another take precidence.  For instance, the whole scene where the older brother complains that the younger one ""cheated"" to move himself ahead a number of spaces, and not even the astronaut has the wherewithall to note that if cheating were possible, they should all try it, since who ""wins"" doesn't matter.  What matters is that they don't all lose.Children quarrel easily, and can be remarkably foolish and stubborn.  This I freely admit, but if they are in mortal danger, they will stand up and harken to it first, before trying to find someone to blame.  This was done in Jumanji, but not Zathura.  I think the scriptwriters on this movie were either being pestered by their own quarreling children WHILE they wrote this script, or else had just come off reading ""lord of the flies"" and decided that all children are barbaric and less intelligent than squirrels; which at least have the basic animal instinct to react to danger until the danger is past.Indeed, I have to say that since this is really only a problem when the game gets involved, I almost found myself wishing the game had never been in the movie, and that it had just been a movie about two brothers learning about each other while being left alone in a house with their irresponsible sister, which is a shame, since the game is kinda supposed to be what the whole movie is about, right?Of course, this is the biggest problem with this movie (unrealistic dialogue,) but there are other shortcomings it has that Jumanji lacked.  At least, these things are shortcomings in my mind.First, I think the fact that the boys adventure takes place entirely in another world didn't really help things any.  Realistically, they sort of had to do it that way, in order for it to be a space exploring game, but I kind of prefer the effect when there's some scenery to worry about beyond one house, a starfield and a few alien ships.  I always liked the scenes in Jumanji where the stampeding animals ran through town and stomped all over that one car.  They could have at least visited another planet or something and showed some scenery like that.However, more importantly, the game (I know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief regarding the game, but this bothered me) seems to appear just before the younger brother finds it, and disappear just after they finish.  It's apparently been lying in the basement of their house (an old house, admittedly, but it's not like someone tried to get rid of it, like they did Jumanji,) visible behind the stairs in that basement to anyone who turns around to walk up them.  It would have made a whole lot more sense (at least to me,) if the game had been found by the younger brother in a crater in a local park or something; all that remained of a meteorite.  Plus, I just thought that up on the spot.  You could also do a lot of other origin stories that make even more sense.  Aliens drop it off to get rid of it, it comes from the future due to a time warp, it was manufactured by a race of spacefaring immortals and lost by one of their children... the list goes on.  The game has no origin, and it easily could.  How much imagination does it really take?However, and this bothered me a lot more, the game is left on the floor where anyone could get at it after they win.  What, do they WANT somebody to come along and get lost in space after they've just barely escaped with their lives?  It was another thing about their behavior that didn't add up.  At least bury it in the backyard or something.I've already commented on the lack of scenery, but let me do so once more.  Even at the beginning and ending of the movie, where you get to see the yard and street connected to the house, the camera never dares to zoom into someone else's yard and the script never calls for the boys to go off the property for any reason, and it fades out just as they're about to leave the lot at the end of the movie.  Disappointing.  This isn't the Sims, for goodness sake.  It's okay to show the neighborhood (unless the neighborhood pulled out of the movie at the last minute.)But I think the worst thing, for me, wasn't the confined space of this movie (irony there... sorta...) but the fact that there really weren't any action sequences at all.  Children fighting with giant, poison misquitos and spiders is an action sequence.  Robin Williams fending off an african lion is an action sequence.  These kids typically aren't called upon to do anything but run from one place to another, pick things up, carry them, put them down, break some furniture, and hold up cards.  For those who are familiar with beer, let me say that this movie felt like Jumanji Lite; not as exciting to make it go down easier.Indeed, Zathura goes down easy, and that's my issue.  I know this movie clearly was intended for kids after having watched it, but I'm pretty sure Jumanji was too, and it was also enjoyable to adults.  It took a stupid, unrealistic, silly and impossible piece of subject matter and did as much with it as was humanly possible at the time, achieving the delicate balance of stressing the character traits and life experiences of the characters it portrays, but not allowing those traits to take center stage, watermarking them over the mortal danger, or really even letting them distract the viewers from the centerpiece of the movie.Long and short, Jumanji was better.  The graphics and sound have improved over the last decade, but that's to be expected.  Graphics and sound quality are pretty much all this film had on Jumanji.  I won't say it's a downright bad film, because there are enjoyable elements to it, and a kid might like it more than I (an artist) do, but after having seen it once, I can't picture myself purchasing it.",2,Time to play the game...,1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,8412,"['had', ""n't"", 'even', 'been', 'conceived', 'back', '1959', 'was', 'when', 'mom', 'was', 'still', 'school', 'Nonetheless', 'sat',

963127,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000DBHX4M,Larry VanDeSande,"[22, 23]","A highly entertaining family film about the inadvertant adventure of two boys and their teenage sister, ""Zathura"" is a space game the bumbling brothers find one day while stationed at dad's house (the parents are divorced and dad gets parenting time in this flick.) After about 15 minutes setting the scene of the brothers intermittently fighting, cutting down each other, failing to get along, and being bored at dad's house, dad goes to the store, the younger borther finds the game and, wow, does the movie go into outer space.The game requires each player to turn a knob which tells them where to move, after which their spaceship correspondingly advances on the board, and a card pops up with a message. Essentially, whatever comes up on a popup card in the game happens to the boys in real life. Right away, their dad's house is hoisted to the universe where they are variously attacked by spacecraft, hone in on and rescue a lost astronaut, try to survive a deranged robot, fail to be fried by passage too close to somebody's sun, and a half-dozen other calamaities. Oh yeah, their sister becomes cryonic during one of these gambits and spends time as a frozen statue. That astronaut turns out to be somebody pretty special, too.Jon Favreau's direction, the outer space staging, and the set designs are all sumptuous in this highly-evolved film that is basically for kids...but my wife and I laughed throughout and stayed involved all the way to the end. There's a moral to this tale, of course, that is predictably homespun. Tim Robbins plays the dad in the opening and closing scenes; he must have been filming elsewhere when he made this flick.One unanticipated devlopment from this game, er, movie -- the score reminded me so much of Gustav Holst's ""The Planets"" that I soon bought a newer version of that music. Don't know if that one's any good; I'll grade it here later. This movie is definitely a winner for anyone that is or once was a child and has (or had) an imagination.

First, this one is about a game that takes you to outer space instead of a game that brings the jungle to you.  Actually that would be two key differences, so since I have messed this up already let me get to the most significant difference, which is that this one is about a pair of bickering brothers where as the other was another opportunity for Robin Williams to run around crazy (which always has its moments).  It might seem strange that the main attraction in a film filled with special effects turns out to be a couple of brothers being mean to each other in a way that only brothers can be, but a fantasy has to be grounded in reality to really touch an audience and that is what happens with these two kids.On a dad weekend Walter (Josh Hutcherson) is being incessantly bugged by his younger brother, Danny (Jonah Bobo).  While dad is out of the house and their older sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart) is lost beneath her headphones, Danny finds the Zathura game and gets his brother to play.  As the first move is completed a card pops out warning them to take cover from a meteor shower and the next minute that is exactly what they are doing.  Then they discover the house is in outer space and the only way to get home is to keep playing the game.  Unless, of course, the house is destroyed by Zorgons before they get that far.  The one constant as the two brothers continue to play the game is the way that they keep going at each other, and even when an adult (Dax Shepherd) enters the game, Danny and Walter are not going to stop.I was really struck by how different ""Zathura"" was from ""Jumanji"" right up tot he moment that I became aware of the most significant thing they have in common.  Jon Favreau (who is currently working on ""John Carter of Mars,"" which it looks like will actually come out before we get to the centennial for ERB's pulp fiction adventure) focuses on the story of Chris Van Allsburg's book more than his drawings, which makes perfect sense even though if they figure out a way to animate one of his books so that those exquisite pencil drawings come to life that would blow everybody away.  As an object lesson ""Zathura:The Space Adventure"" might be over the top, but when you have kids who fight like cats and dogs something that metaphorically hits them over the head really hard is sometimes what is needed.  Unfortunately, kids who need a lesson like that will be too caught up in the idea of playing the game that getting the message of this 2005 film.",4,"Tired of your kids trying to kill each other?

It was funny, it was original, and it's stood the test of the time (so far). I bought Zathura on the off chance, as I needed another DVD to complete the deal.But Zathura is practically a carbon copy of Jumanji, but set in space, and with robots, and stranded astronauts (hello Dax Shephard), instead of out of control animals. Both were originally books, and Zathura is a sequel to Jumanji in the books. But they're just too similar, it's like the author couldn't think of another good idea, so decided to rehash his previous story. Both share the same plot device: children find a board game that transports them into another world effectively and cards are drawn that decide their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the game, is to play it.There was a cool twist towards the end, but unfortunately I saw it coming, which was mighty clever of me, since I'm normally the last to spot these when it's staring me right in the face. Kristen Stewart, the girl from Panic Room, is in it a shocking little amount of time, and really isn't necessary to the story, apart from the fact she wears little more than a skimpy t-shirt, and what can only be described as guy's boxers. Basically, she's in the movie to look cute.I was very disappointed in this, and every minute seemed to last a lot longer. It doesn't live up to Jumanji in my eyes, and if I ever have kids, I will be sitting them in front of Jumanji not Zathura.

Naturally, a lot of it is computer enhanced, and you know how it is going to end, but as someone famous once said, it's the journey that matters.The small quibbles that I have are thus:1) The kids just aren't nice to one another during the movie's majority.  Naturally, they learn in the end how to love each other, but I spent a lot of time explaining to our four year old that it just wasn't nice to talk that way.2) It is pretty scary in parts.

Based upon the 2002 book""Zathura""by Chris Van Allsburg, (who also wrote the book""Jumanji""in 1981), the plot of the film ""Zathura"" is very similar to ""Jumanji"" as it centers around a mysterious & magical board game.  In this case, the name of the board game is Zathura, which is found by the youngest of two rivaling brothers: Walter (Josh Hutcherson) who is 10 years old and Danny (Jonah Bobo) who is 6 years old.  Walter, Danny and their older teenage sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart) are the children of recently divorced parents.  The children's mother is never shown, but their father (Tim Robbins) does his best to spend time with the boys in spite of his busy work schedule.  It is when the father has to leave on the weekend to attend a meeting that Walter & Danny get into a heated argument as Walter really can't stand Danny and repeatedly accuses Danny of cheating in just about everything.  Danny tried to hide from Walter inside of an old dumbwaiter built into their father's old house.  Walter finds Danny and lowers him into the dark basement, which frightens Danny considerably.  In the basement, Danny finds the courage to come out of the dumbwaiter and it is there that he find the box containing the Zathura board game under the stairs leading back up into the house.  Danny brings the game upstairs to see if Walter will play with him as they are both bored and not happy that their father had to leave.  It is when Danny starts to the play the game that the sci-fi fantasy begins as their father's house is magically transported into space near a ringed & multi-mooned planet resembling Saturn.  Walter & Danny try desperately to get help from Lisa, but thinking that it's dark outside, she runs into the bathroom to get ready for a date.  In the meantime, the boys continue to play, which only allows more unusual & dangerous things to occur, such as the appearance of a mad robot, lizard-like aliens and a mysterious astronaut (Dax Shepard).  With Walter & Danny continuing to fight and Danny being reluctant to continue to play, will any of them ever see home again?Directed by Jon Favreau, with extravagant special effects, good cinematography, an interesting story (more so than ""Jumanji"") and mostly engaging characters, ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" is a film worth watching.  The primary downside to the film is the almost constant fighting between Walter & Danny, as well as Walter's very poor attitude during most of the film; but this is better explained towards the end of the film.

On its own merits, however, it's an entertaining if noisy little film.  The brothers, wisecracking insensitive Walter (Josh Hutcherson) and whiny, nerdish Danny (Jonah Bobo), aren't instantly likeable as all they do is fuss and feud and act like little hellions.  Father (Tim Robbins) and mama are divorced and that excuse of a broken home souring the kids is used again.  (Coming from a broken home myself, I find it insulting to think that divorce is blamed once again; the father has actually spoiled the brats).  They also have the obligatory insolent older sister (Kristen Stewart).  One day little Danny finds a board game called Zathura and before you know it, the siblings find themselves off into space, house and all.  They play the game with varying perils and they hook up with a stranded astronaut (an effective Dax Stewart) who aids them in a fight against reptilian aliens called Zorgons.

""Zathura"" is a sequel to ""Jumanji"", it is about what happened when the Budwing brothers opened the game box that Peter and Judy discarded at the end of ""Jumanji"". Early board games were often designed with two-sided boards so that the game pieces could be used to play two different games-usually of the same type. ""Zathura"" was the flip side of the ""Jumanji"" game board and the ones the brothers choose to play (because Walter did not like jungle games). So it is supposed to be another ""Jumanji"".Having grown up with this same sibling age dynamic (six and ten) I was not surprised at the amount of yelling, anger, and resentment that goes on between the two brothers. I was however surprised that anyone would find this sort of thing entertaining. While their divorced father (Tim Robbins playing the only sympathetic character in the film) is away at a meeting, the younger brother (Danny) finds an old Zathura game in the basement. Based on those old 1950's tin toys it involves two tin spaceships on a track racing around space. Each spin of the dial determines the distance the ship will move on that turn and a card is ejected detailing what happens to the ship at that point of space.As Danny and Walter face the challenges of space they discover that they can work as a team and they even develop some affection for each other (a more unrealistic idea than anything they actually encounter in space).Like the source book, the movie adaptation of ""Zathura"" targets kindergarten to Grade 5 children. Like ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl"", older viewers will find very little of interest other than a fun production design and nice effects.Unfortunately ""Zathura"" it is not as pure as that film which uniquely refused to compromise its ""for kids only"" story. ""Zathura"" does compromise, as the producers attempt to expand their audience by creating an older sister (Lisa played by Kristen Stewart) who was not a character in the book. While Stewart is fine in this role and even provides some comic relief, it is rather disturbing that the producers chose to turn her into a pubescent sex object, blustering around the house in her underwear for most of the film. Van Allsburg's illustrations are the best part of his books but this image is not one than he has ever published.The DVD has some excellent special features, which even older viewers will enjoy.  The best is an interview with Van Allsburg in which he discusses his influences and his other books.Then again, what do I know?

We've gotten the amazing and utterly joyful Wallace and Gromit in the Curse of the Wererabbit, we've gotten the magical and rich world of MirrorMask, and we've gotten the science fiction bonanza of Zathura.The latter film and the focus of this little review is a story about a breaking home, two brothers in a divorced family that argue all of the time and can't seem to be comfortable with each other and who, eventually, must work out their differences in a pretty magnificent and original way: tearing apart the home pane-by-pane as they shoot through outer-space playing a board game.Which is interesting, if you think about it, the whole theme of broken home/horrors of nature that the characters experience in this film and in Jumanji, it's counterpart.  It's not a big theme, it's just something that's there, but both groups of children have relatively unhappy homelifes and they both play a board game that realizes their fears and causes them to grow up, in a sense.In terms of any realness to this picture, some people might feel stuff a bit lacking.  You know, they can breathe in space, the couch keeps burning after it leaves the atmosphere of the living room, so on and so forth.  Actual physics has next to nothing of importance in this film, but what it does have is pretty amazing special effects... as in, really, I couldn't see through any of them.  Huh, weird, since much bigger and more appreciated films with much bigger budgets tend to have very obvious special effects and an entire lack of a plot, too!  State of contemporary film, people.The only thing really a problem with this film, if one considers it a problem, is that the character of Lisa is pretty underdeveloped and actually helps undermine a lot of what the boys discover about trust and growing up.  However, she becomes such a minor character that it's mostly incidental, so if she bothers you she's easier to ignore.  Then, of course, it's kind of hard to imagine any house taking that much abuse and still stand, right to the very end, even taking into account the lack of care for physics and reality in it.  So if those are issues that really bother you, I guess you'll just have to be bothered.--PolarisDiB",4,Sci Fi Action Adventure,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,2313,"['been', 'good', 'couple', 'weeks', 'family', 'family-rated', 'films', 'out', 'DVD', 'past', 'couple', 'weeks', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'amazing', 'utterly', 'joyful', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'Curse', 'Wererabbit', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'magical', 'rich', 'world', 'MirrorMask', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'science', 'fiction', 'bonanza', 'Zathura.The', 'latter', 'film', 'focus', 'little', 'review', 'story', 'breaking', 'home', 'two', 'brothers', 'divorced', 'family', 'argue', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'comfortable', 'other', 'who', 'eventually', 'must', 'work', 'out', 'differences', 'pretty', 'magnificent', 'original', 'way', 'tearing', 'home', 'pane-by-pane', 'shoot', 'outer-space', 'playing', 'board', 'game.Which', 'interesting', 'think', 'whole', 'theme', 'broken', 'home/horrors', 'nature', 'characters', 'experience', 'film', 'Jumanji', 'counterpart', 'not', 'big', 'theme', 'just', 'something', 'there', 'groups', 'children', 'have', 'relatively', 'unhappy', 'homelifes', 'play', 'board', 'game', 'fears', 'grow', 'up', 'sense.In', 'terms', 'realness', 'picture', 'people', 'might', 'feel', 'stuff', 'bit', 'lacking', 'know', 'can', 'breathe', 'space', 'couch', 'keeps', 'burning', 'atmosphere', 'living', 'room', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'Actual', 'physics', 'next', 'nothing', 'importance', 'film', 'what', 'have', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'Huh', 'weird', 'much', 'bigger', 'more', 'appreciated', 'films', 'much', 'bigger', 'budgets', 'tend', 'have', 'very', 'obvious', 'special', 'effects', 'entire', 'lack', 'plot', 'too', 'State', 'contemporary', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'problem', 'film', 'one', 'problem', 'character', 'Lisa', 'pretty', 'underdeveloped', 'actually', 'undermine', 'lot', 'what', 'boys', 'discover', 'trust', 'growing', 'up', 'However', 'such', 'minor', 'character', 'mostly', 'incidental', 'so', 'easier', 'ignore', 'Then', 'course', 'kind', 'hard', 'imagine', 'house', 'taking', 'much', 'abuse', 'still', 'stand', 'right', 'very', 'end', 'even', 'taking', 'account', 'lack', 'care', 'physics', 'reality', 'So', 'are', 'issues', 'really', 'bother', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'be', 'bothered.', 'PolarisDiB']",Zathura

Zathura successfully ponders many tensions in our daily lives, such as sibling rivalry. The two brothers in this film are very dysfunctional and are both full of pure hatred for one another.  Don't worry, there is a fantastically satisfying ending. The divorce of the parents had destroyed the relationship between the two. The little brother is always living in his brother's shadow. Desperately trying to get his father to be proud of him. Zathura offers a engaging story with a great balance of everything. The special effects are extremely believable and the sets and props are outstanding. They definitely look alien for sure. The film offers some brilliant photography and dazzling lighting.

Destination Moon, made over 50 years ago, was more accurate.  However, by the end the story was so good it gets 5 stars anyway.It's about two brothers who find an old game, Zathura, in the basement, and when they play it, like in the same author's ""Jumanji,"" things start to happen.  A game card warns of a meteor shower, and real meteors breech the roof of the house.  It turns out once they started playing, the whole house has been displaced into outer space, and they have to finish the game to get back, even if it brings on horrendous aliens and other grave dangers.  It's more than just ""Jumanji In Space"" though, with some family lessons as good as, but different from that earlier film.The most glaring mistakes are:  One, when the house enters a gravity field.  We see things falling off shelves all over the house, and pieces falling off the outside of the house.  You don't have to be a science student; anyone who reads sci-fi (Heinlein, Clarke, etc.) knows that the house would fall at the same rate as everything in it and there would be no relative motion.  Furthermore, in the next scene there are still some dishes on the shelves to rattle and fall.  Two, they set a couch on fire and push it out into space, where it continues buring with visible yellow flames as it floats away.  Of course there's no oxygen in space and nothing would burn in that manner even if supplied with oxygen.  All that's really a shame because the movie could have had some educational value if they'd bothered to get some facts right.I guess you just have to take it as a children's fantasy instead of serious SF, and as such it's an exceptionally good movie.",5,"Technically flawed, but exceptionally good in a bad movie year.",1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,1778,"['ZathuraDuring', 'first', 'half', 'Zathura', 'was', 'thinking', 'subtracting', 'one', 'star', 'review', 'due', 'scientific', 'flaws', 'Destination', 'Moon', 'made', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'more', 'accurate', 'However', 'end', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'good', '5', 'stars', 'anyway.It', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'find', 'old', 'game', 'Zathura', 'basement', 'when', 'play', 'same', 'author', 'Jumanji', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'game', 'card', 'warns', 'meteor', 'shower', 'real', 'meteors', 'breech', 'roof', 'house', 'out', 'once', 'started', 'playing', 'whole', 'house', 'been', 'displaced', 'outer', 'space', 'have', 'finish', 'game', 'get', 'back', 'even', 'horrendous', 'aliens', 'other', 'grave', 'dangers', 'more', 'just', 'Jumanji', 'Space', 'family', 'lessons', 'as', 'good', 'different', 'earlier', 'most', 'glaring', 'mistakes', 'are', 'One', 'when', 'house', 'gravity', 'field', 'see', 'things', 'falling', 'off', 'shelves', 'house', 'pieces', 'falling', 'outside', 'house', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'science', 'student', 'anyone', 'who', 'sci-fi', 'Heinlein', 'Clarke', 'etc', 'house', 'would', 'fall', 'same', 'rate', 'everything', 'would', 'be', 'relative', 'motion', 'Furthermore', 'next', 'scene', 'are', 'still', 'dishes', 'shelves', 'rattle', 'fall', 'Two', 'set', 'couch', 'fire', 'push', 'out', 'space', 'where', 'buring', 'visible', 'yellow', 'flames', 'away', 'course', 'oxygen', 'space', 'nothing', 'would', 'burn', 'manner', 'even', 'supplied', 'oxygen', 'really', 'shame', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'educational', 'value', ""'d"", 'bothered', 'get', 'facts', 'right.I', 'guess', 'just', 'have', 'take', 'children', 'fantasy', 'instead', 'serious', 'SF', 'such', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'movie']",Zathura

The special effects are quite good and the art design is outstanding, but as an adult I require a bit of a story to go with my smoke and mirrors.  The film does a large number of things right.  The look is absolutely spectacular from beginning to end and I loved the way that the art design reminded one of the forties to fit the design of the game.  Unfortunately, the plot was pretty much nonexistent.  If one has seen the quite excellent JUMANJI, one knows what to expect.  But this one lacks the originality of that film as well as the large cast and varied sets.  This film is restricted to a house in outer space, precluding both varieties in locations and in cast.Despite the above-mentioned restrictions, this might still have been a good movie if only the script had been stronger.  There just wasn't much to it, and the entire brother versus brother aspect got intensely tiresome well before the utterly predictable bonding that inevitably took place before the end of the film.  Indeed, the screaming matches between the two brothers caused me more than once to nearly turn the film off before I had completed it, something that almost never happens (I can almost count all the films I have started but not finished on the fingers of both hands).Would I recommend a parent showing this to a younger child?

963159,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000DBHX4M,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 3]","It sounds like Jumanji transplanted to space - two young sibs, the product of a broken marriage, accidentally start playing a game that soon envelopes their reality.  The only way to finish the game - which catapults their house into deep space - is to reach Zathura and finish the game.  Along the way, Danny and his unloving brother Walter will bury their differences as they face off against a homicidal robot, meteor showers and hordes of carnivorous reptilian Zorgons.  (""They eat meat.  We're meat!!"" Danny yelps.)My first thought when catching the trailer for this flick was that the guys who made ""Jumanji"" should sue - until I found out that both ""Zathura"" were based on books (surprising enough) written by the same guy.  (Two similar movies based on books written by the same guy, but not one adaptation of ""House with a clock in its Walls""?  What black hole has Planet Hollywood fallen into?)  While the older movie had a broader plot and more characters, I appreciated the slim offerings of ""Zathura"" even more.  The action kept me holding on, the treacly emotional scenes are happily few and there are some genuine surprises.  It's a fun movie, diverting in that unassuming way that Hollywood sometimes is.FOR KIDS? ""Zathura"" is one of those movies that makes you wonder whether it should be seen by anybody old enough to have been in the movie.  I'm not sure how parents should decide - I would let me kids watch it, just not alone.  On the one hand, the violence is minimal - on the other hand, the threat of violence is everywhere, and the gap between the two gets pretty close.  (The killer robot never actually kills anybody, but its intentions are pretty clear, and they involve buzzsaws and grasping claws.)

963168,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B000DBHX4M,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[17, 18]","I went into this movie at first not expecting much, and if you look at it on paper that's exactly how it seems. This observation starts changing with each new scene in the movie opening up a very pleasant experience all around. Zathura is a spiritual sequel/remake of Jumanji, and aside from the whole story being based on playing a board game there are almost no similarities between the two. That being said Zathura is a great film about sibling rivalry and bonding that unfolds in an ever-expanding universe of imagination and wonder. It's a family film best suited for young adults and young at heart.Here's the plot. Two brothers decide to play an old wind up board game found in the basement. Every time they come to an event on the game it comes to life. This being a sci-fi game those events come in the forms of a rampaging robot, menacing aliens, a wayward astronaut, meteor storms and other sorts of mayhem that systematically trash their house and challenge the brothers to outrun or out-think their way out of every situation. In the process the brothers build a stronger connection with each other that ends with a very satisfying, even if ultimately stereotypical, happy ending.The story is laid out in such a way where the viewer is learning new things as the plot moves forward. The set up of the characters and their lives, playing Zathura, finding solutions on the way. All of this is done in a way that empathizes with the point of view of the kids. Notice I didn't say ""through their eyes"". This isn't a movie trying to pander to younger audiences with goofy gimmicks. The storytelling is mature while at the same time very accessible. As an aside this story just isn't evolving around the family. There is a universe that unfolds from the game that resonates more than just being various creatures and events to build excitement. It comes out as a living, breathing entity of itself that feels like it will go on long after the boys finish with their game.At its core this movie is a science fiction film, and the imagination put behind that element on Zathura is really nice. Since the game itself seems to be from the 50's era the robots and spaceships in the film have that nostalgic and classic sci-fi look. If you like the Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers look back in that day you will love this homage to the style. The alien baddies on the film, the Zorgons, are a pretty well developed concept with the creatures having a bit of depth in it more so than just a generic bad guy. They also are the coolest looking reptile alien I have seen.The special effects for this movie are beyond excellent. Director Jon Favreau (of Iron Man fame) decided to use as much practical effects as possible and the end result is so visceral and tangible that it shames all of those movies who opt for pure CGI for their effects. Real walls come tumbling down. The rocketships and embattled house in space are real models. The explosions and flames are real. The Zorgons (designed by legendary Stan Winston in fact) have real actors in them along with animatronics. When you see a robot running in a kitchen knocking down dishes it's really a guy in a bulky costume slipping all over the floor and tearing up real props. Sure computer effects are used to touch up that robot and add digital backdrops. This amount of tactile interaction makes what you see feel a lot more real. It makes all the difference.The acting is impressive and shows some real keen strategy in the casting. The youngest kid (played by Jonah Bobo) has the big eyed wonder that moms melt for and had that underdog demeanor that all younger brothers feel at one time or another. The older brother (played by Josh Hutcherson) is a classic ""boy too old to be a kid and young to be a man yet trying to reach that plateau"". Both child actors play off their parts with a kind of conviction to the part that impresses me when I see it in adult actors. They are playing kids with kid's complicated lives, and you believe that to the hilt. Then you have their sister (played by Kristen Stewart of Twilight fame). Her time on the screen is not as long as the brothers, but her interaction with them as the teenage sister sells the performance of that complicated relationship a teen would have with younger siblings. The only other main role was the astronaut (Dax Shepard). Dax plays the part with a natural and casual demeanor that says he's used to being in the middle of all the craziness. In other words the acting is as well produced as the special effects and story in my book.Zathura didn't do too well in the box office with a lot of people dismissing it as Jumanji without the star power. More the pity, as this movie to me feels like it's much better than Jumanji's special effects-laden showcase, yet many didn't get a chance to experience that. Now you can get the movie on a Blu-Ray and DVD combo pack, and it includes all of the great special features found on the DVD along with an exclusive extra. Visually I don't think you can get any better on this sort of film. The details from the live action and models really come out. This BD-50 disk (announced region free) is packed with language options with a DTS-HD English 5.1 master audio track and 5.1 Dolby Digital in five languages (Spanish, French, Japanese, Portugese and Thai). Subtitles are in all these languages plus Chinese (traditional Mandarin I think), Korean, Dutch, Indonesian and Arabic. Here are the features:Audio Commentary - With director Jon Favreau and producer Peter Billingsley. They have really good chemistry on this commentary and you get a score of interesting information as well as some entertaining banter.The Right Moves: The Making of Zathura - Goes over the book the movie is based on and how the production wished to honor that book. They also go over the human aspect of the film and in capturing that element in the story.Race to the Black Planet: A Visual Effects Documentary - This is a really cool making of featurette that shows how they did all of those practical effects I was talking about as well as the CGI and digital elements of the film. You get to see some cool pre-production footage and how they tweaked it in post production.The Cast - Actor profiles and their comments on making the film. Some cute anecdotes like how Bobo was loosing his baby teeth during filming and they had to get a bridge made for him.Zorgons, Robots and Frozen Lisa - A featurette on Stan Winston and his company's contributions to the movie.Making the Game - A little documentary on the game Zathura and what thoughts went behind designing it.Miniatures - Remember when I said they used miniatures for the spaceships and exteriors of the house in space? Well here you get to see those efforts and get some insight on why they were the best choice.The World of Chris Van Allsburg - Kind of a tribute to the author of the book the movie is based on. It goes through a little biography of Van Allsburg.Race Through Space: Virtual Board Game - This is a Blu-Ray exclusive. While all the other featurettes will be on both Blu-Ray and DVD this one is only on the BD. This is a two player game where you race to beat your opponent on a digital board game by answering film related trivia questions.Zathura is a grossly under-appreciated film that has gotten lots of good feedback from people who saw it, but unfortunately not many people actually did. Sci-fi fans, with families or without, do yourself a favor and get this flick. The Blu-Ray has a lot of great extras and will likely look awesome on top of that.",5,Awesome family sci-fi now on Blu-Ray,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",2011,7565,"['went', 'movie', 'first', 'not',

963170,AGMW3I34INNYG,B000DBHX4M,Stephen Cannon,"[1, 1]","Zathura bears a striking similarity to Jumanji.  This is not shocking, considering that both were originally novels written by the same author, Chris Van Allsburg.  The principal difference here is that Zathura is a board game about outer space, and as the two brothers who are at the center of the film begin to play the game, their house ends up in space.The strength of this movie is that it depends almost entirely on two young but very talented actors to carry it through its one hour and fifty minute ride.  The two young men are quite engaging, and give convincing depth to the big brother/little brother relationship.  They are joined along the way by an astronaut and their older teenage sister, who has little to do but does just fine doing it.The effects work here is nice.  In the CG age, it's hard to note anything as being a standout, but outer space here is vast and beautiful, and the 'destructive' effects are a little scary.As Zathura reaches its third act, the story bogs down.  There is some sentimentality and predictability, but on the whole there is great fun to be had here.  This movie is ok for kids who are not overly sensitive to frightening images.

Dad (Tim Robbins) asks her to keep an eye on them as he runs to the office to pick up something for an upcoming meeting.  Being the teenager she is, she promptly goes back to sleep. Walter wants to watch baseball on TV, avoiding his younger brother. When Danny proves to be too much of a pest, Walter chases him throughout the house. He finds Danny hiding in the old dumb waiter and lowers him into the basement. Danny finds his way to the stairs and notices an old board game hiding between the wooden steps. ""Zathura, a Space Adventure for Two Players"". Danny excitedly shows the game to Walter who ignores him. Danny opens the box and turns the key on the board, causing a button to pop out. He presses the button. His spaceship is moved mechanically across the board. A card pops out. It reads ""Meteor Shower. Take Evasive Action."" Danny can't read the card and shows Walter. Walter looks at the card and explains what it means just as meteors begin to destroy the living room. They soon realize that their house is floating in outer space. The only way home? To complete the game.""Zathura"", directed by Jon Favreau (""Elf"", ""Made"", ""Swingers""), is based on a Chris Van Allsburg book, the same children's book author behind ""Jumanji"" and ""The Polar Express"".A well-crafted film suitable for the whole family, ""Zathura"" is a delight.The story is involving and interesting and effectively brings us into the lives of these children. As Danny and Walter run around the house, getting on each others nerves, they seem entirely realistic; two young boys, stuck inside, bored, on a Saturday afternoon. What else would they do except annoy each other, get into mischief and make various attempts to play together? As soon as they find the game, the story really kicks into gear. They realize that they have to play the game through to the end, to get their house back to its small lot in Pasadena and for everything to return to normal. As they play the game, they realize that they have to work together to overcome the challenges of Zathura.""Jumanji"" had a similar premise, but ""Zathura"" is a very different film. The first film seemed overflowing with characters and animals. ""Zathura"" takes a different approach, telling the story of the two brothers and a couple of visitors who help out through the course of the story. Because of this, ""Zathura"" seems more manageable, more intimate. The first film had Robin Williams' antics, but this new film seems better, more enjoyable, more like a real adventure.Each card popping out of the machine signals the beginning of a new part of the adventure, a new challenge. Some of these put the two boys in dangerous situations that only strengthen the bond between them, others provide some comic relief. An early card reads ""Player enters cryogenic sleep chamber. For next five turns."" Lisa (Stewart), still not realizing that the house is floating through space walks into her bathroom, concerned that she will be late for her date, and instantly freezes solid. The two boys don't know what to do, except to keep her safe until that action has expired. Another card reads ""Rescue Abandoned Astronaut"". At that very moment, an astronaut (Dax Shepard, TV's ""Punked"") flies by the front door. After they rescue him, he proves particularly useful during the remaining challenges.When you were a kid, you most likely played games or with toys, imagining they were real and you were actually interacting with them. ""Zathura"" brilliantly captures this feeling, taking it to a new level. Two little boys who were playing a real board game would probably interact in the same way. If one of the players started imagining something a little scary, the other would either encourage him to keep going, to become stronger, or help him through the challenge. The two brothers do this throughout. As various parts of the house are demolished by a robot, heat seeking aliens, and meteors, they scramble to keep the board game, their ticket home, intact.Director Jon Favreau does a great job at the helm. From the beautiful house, a million plus dollar Arts and Crafts home that dad (Robbins) says he is fixing up, to the look and feel of the board game, Favreau has a definite and unique style. Much like in ""Elf"", Favreau likes everything to seem a little retro. In ""Zathura"", the board game graphics and design appear to have been plucked out of the Fifties. A robot, looking more like something from ""Forbidden Planet"" than ""Star Wars Episode III"", makes an appearance. It actually looks like some of the special effects were created the old fashioned way, with models and miniature, rather than excessive CGI, lending the film a charm many parents should appreciate.Favreau also does a nice job with the actors. The two brothers are great. Funny and entirely believable, they could live in any house on your street. Kirsten Stewart is also very funny as Lisa, the typical teenage girl. And Dax Stewart does a nice job as the slightly charismatic astronaut.""Zathura"" is that rare live action film good for the entire family. Kids will love it and adults will enjoy watching it. A couple of the scenes are probably too scary for some of the youngest children. Children Danny's age, under 7, will probably find the film too scary. But everyone else should have a great time playing ""Zathura"".",4,An Adventure for the Whole Family,1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,5460,"['Danny', 'Jonah', 'Bobo', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'Walter',

If the idea worked once do it again and again and again ad nauseum until you kill the charm of the film that inspired the craze. ""Zathura"" appeared to be a fun adventure fantasy on the surface but boy did it look like it lived up to the recycling trend. Luckily I was wrong. While the basic inspiration is the same (a board game that comes to life)director Jon Favreau and his writers David Koepp & John Kamps revisit the basic concept and then do their own fun spin on it. Based on another book by Chris Van Allsburg (""Jumanji"", ""The Polar Express"")and adeptly directed by Favreau ""Zathura"" is a fun adventure that's just familair enough to entice kids to want to watch it with enough surprises to keep both parents and kids entertained.Walter (Josh Hutcherson from Kicking and Screaming), Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Lisa (Kristen Stewart from Panic Room)are typical siblings. They torture each other as much as their parents can stand it. Their Dad (Tim Robbins in a nice cameo) is recently divorced and everyone is trying to cope with a family ripped apart. Danny finds the board game Zathura in the basement of their new home. This ancient board game looks like it was made in the 50's (as does everything they run into from the game). Once they start playing it they get sucked into the Zathura universe. They run into insane robots and giant lizards that like to eat human flesh (don't worry we don't see any of that). The only way home is to finish the game.The film is a lot of fun. My three kids loved it (ages 7 to 12). There are some minor bad words in the movie which got overlooked the first time in theaters (hence the PG rating) The performances are first rate and kids will be able to relate to the conflicts between the three siblings. There's also a a number of nice plot twists. Like Favreau's last film ""Elf"" he gives ""Zathura"" heart and humor in equal doses.The DVD itself looks first rate with a high definition transfer from Sony. There's lots of extras for this set which film fans will enjoy that go behind-the-scenes into the design of the movie, visual effects and a sectionon the world of illustrator/author Chris Van Allsburg. The producer and director do a commentary track that's really informative to listen to unlike a lot of these tracks.""Zathura"" does recycle the basic premise from ""Jumanji"" (hey, there's only 36 dramatic situations in the world and the Greeks thought of them all so it is all, in a sense, recycling)but more importantly it's what you do with the material that matters. The crew here does a terrific job of crafting an entertaining movie that will appeal to lots of folks.",4,"Fun adventure for kids 7and up from Director of ""Elf"".

The acting by the children is mediocre but visually it's fun to watch. I felt that Josh Hutcherson acting was especially poor and I think that he will be out of showbiz once he becomes an adult. I was particularly annoyed by the packaging of the DVD. It prominently shows Kristen Stewart who plays their teenage sister.

(A projectionists work is never done) So I was glad to get the BluRay for not a lot of money.  For the ""family sci-fi crowd"" this is a very entertaining film and is was fun the see ""Twilight girl"" Christen Stewart in an early role, not to mention Dax Shephard from TV's ""Parenthood.""

With nothing better to do, they start in on the board game's imaginary space adventure, only to discover that it's not imaginary at all. When a playing card says ""meteor shower,"" a hail of burning stones pummels their living room. Also, you should see the new view from the house's front door ...Each new turn in the game adds to the adventure, which is pretty much all the movie is about. Oh, a sibling rivalry gets resolved along the way, but that seems an afterthought, pasted on so the plot has some kind of beginning and ending. An overbearing older sister in a permanent snit figures in, too, but just barely - the game sidelines her early on, then brings her back when a girly bit of screaming seems appropriate.I haven't read Van Allsburg's children's book, the one that this movie comes from, so I can't say anything about the adaptation. That aside, this movie offers good commodity entertainment. It's kid-friendly (as long as your kid isn't too skittish), with enough action to keep a grown-up from falling asleep. If it never rises above the ""rainy afternoon"" category, that's fine.

963181,A303AR58MOOYAV,B000DBHX4M,"Woofboy ""Woofboy""","[1, 8]","I had no idea that Chris Van Allsburg had written Zathura.  When I saw the trailer for Zathura and heard ""from the world of Jumanji"" being advertised, I figured it was just the movie studio trying to reap more money out of Chris Van Allsburg's Jumanji.  When I got to the theatre, I was plesantly suprised to see that it was actually based on a book that Chris Van Allsburg had written.The movie started out with overly done bickering brothers who seemed to be bickering for a bit too long by the time the game of Zathura was found in the basement.  In this beginning part of the movie, I was very suprised at two words that were written to come out of a 10 year old's mouth.  It was unexpected and unnecessary.The bickering brothers began playing Zathura and realized that they were in outer space after meteors destroy their living room after the first move of the game.  They go and open the door and see that they are floating through an asteroid belt somewhere in outer space, but yet they could breath perfectly, and there was normal earth gravity for the majority of the movie, unless you spit off of the porch, and then the spit would float away.  Each move of the board brought something new, whether it be a malfunctioning robot voiced by Frank Oz (voice of Yoda, Miss Piggy), picking up a stranded astronaught that has been drifting through space for the past 15 years after first playing Zathura, or being attacked by Zorgons.  Speaking of Zorgons, was it just me, or were Zorgons a tribute to a few different movies?  When searching the house, the Zorgons reminded me a whole lot of the raptors from the Jurassic Park movies.  Their ships looked like ships from classic sci-fi movies, but without really thinking about it, it dawned on me that they look a WHOLE lot like the Natalus from 20,000 leagues under the sea, and then in the Zorgon ship itself, there was the tribute to Citizen Kane.  It wasn't exactly Rosebud, but close enough.  I see I'm not the only amazon reviewer that spotted that, but I have a feeling that most people completely missed that.Overall, the movie didn't have an original enough story.  It was just Jumanji all over again, only this time in space and with a much smaller (and less famous) cast.  The language and intense scenes did seem way too much for a PG movie as well.  It could have easily been rated PG-13 in my opinion...",2,Seemed a bit too intense for a PG movie...,1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,2372,"['had', 'idea', 'Chris', 'Van', 'Allsburg', 'had', 'written', 'Zathura', 'When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Zathura', 'heard', 'world', 'Jumanji', 'being', 'advertised', 'figured', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'studio', 'trying', 'reap', 'more', 'money', 'Chris', 'Van', 'Allsburg', 'Jumanji', 'When', 'got', 'theatre', 'was', 'plesantly', 'suprised', 'see', 'was', 'actually', 'based', 'book', 'Chris', 'Van', 'Allsburg', 'had', 'written.The', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'overly', 'done', 'bickering', 'brothers', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'bickering', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'time', 'game', 'Zathura', 'was', 'found', 'basement', 'beginning', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'suprised', 'two', 'words', 'were', 'written', 'come', '10', 'year', 'old', 'mouth', 'was', 'unexpected', 'unnecessary.The', 'bickering', 'brothers', 'began', 'playing', 'Zathura', 'realized', 'were', 'outer', 'space', 'meteors', 'destroy', 'living', 'room', 'first', 'move', 'game', 'go', 'open', 'door', 'see', 'are', 'floating', 'asteroid', 'belt', 'somewhere', 'outer', 'space', 'yet', 'could', 'breath', 'perfectly', 'there', 'was', 'normal', 'earth', 'gravity', 'majority', 'movie', 'spit', 'porch', 'then', 'spit', 'would', 'float', 'away', 'move', 'board', 'brought', 'something', 'new', 'be', 'malfunctioning', 'robot', 'voiced', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'voice', 'Yoda', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'picking', 'up', 'stranded', 'astronaught', 'been', 'drifting', 'space', 'past', '15', 'years', 'first', 'playing', 'Zathura', 'being', 'attacked', 'Zorgons', 'Speaking', 'Zorgons', 'was', 'just', 'were', 'Zorgons', 'tribute', 'few', 'different', 'movies', 'When', 'searching', 'house', 'Zorgons', 'reminded', 'whole', 'lot', 'raptors', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'movies', 'ships', 'looked', 'ships', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'really', 'thinking', 'dawned', 'look', 'WHOLE', 'lot', 'Natalus', '20,000', 'leagues', 'sea', 'then', 'Zorgon', 'ship', 'was', 'tribute', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Rosebud', 'close', 'enough', 'see', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'amazon', 'reviewer', 'spotted', 'have', 'feeling', 'most', 'people', 'completely', 'missed', 'that.Overall', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'original', 'enough', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'Jumanji', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'only', 'time', 'space', 'much', 'smaller', 'less', 'famous', 'cast', 'language', 'intense', 'scenes', 'did', 'seem', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'PG', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'opinion']",Zathura
