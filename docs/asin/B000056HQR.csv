569545,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B000056HQR,Danny G.,"[5, 6]","The first time I watched Common Ground I actually sobbed. Unless a person is Gay, Lesbian or Bisexual, I really think it's very hard for heterosexuals to understand what many of us have gone through, or are currently going through!This brilliant story links together three generations of gay and lesbian struggles in a mythical rural town in Connecticut. I came of age sexually in the second story, which takes place in the 1970's. I can identify only too well what the young gay man experienced at the hands of his fellow, bigoted classmates. And it ain't pretty! But the courage and fortitude he showed to everyone made me feel proud - and relieved - because I know there are people actually like him in the real world!While Common Ground ends on a positive note and Connecticut actually is one of the first states to legalize gay marriage, I wouldn't want to be holding a wedding (or similar) ceremony in a place like rural Oklahoma or in 2/3 of the United States, for that matter! The struggles of previous generations (the first two stories in the film) are still common in way too many places, even if substantial progress has been made in the West Coast, Mid-Atlantic, New England and Iowa (who would have guessed a gay person would have more rights in the heartland than in California? Good For You Iowa!) Unfortunately, the struggle for fairness and common sense needs to continue!Few areas of a person's life is more personal and important than one's own sexuality! I wonder how bigoted heterosexuals would feels if they woke up one morning on another planet and they were made to feel something was wrong with them for being straight instead of, let's say, bisexual! What, you don't engage in romantic relationships with BOTH genders! How strange! How odd! How could you possibly not be sexually attracted to both genders? What's wrong with you? This is a lovely fantasy I wish I could have every bigot experience!I can only hope that in 2009 Common Ground is released on DVD and the extremely ridiculous ""R"" rating is downgraded to PG-13. To realize that a teenager struggling with his or her sexuality could not privately order Common Ground on their own is simply OUTRAGEOUS! The ""R"" rating and the fact that this film has not migrated to DVD speaks volumes about our society's utter stupidity when it comes to treating Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual people fairly.See my other favorite LGBT films:Elliot LovesandLatter Days (Unrated Edition)",5,One Of The Best Films Ever Made Dealing With Same-Sex Love!,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,2451,"['first', 'time', 'watched', 'Common', 'Ground', 'actually', 'sobbed', 'person', 'Gay', 'Lesbian', 'Bisexual', 'really', 'think', 'very', 'hard', 'heterosexuals', 'understand', 'what', 'many', 'have', 'gone', 'are', 'currently', 'going', 'brilliant', 'story', 'links', 'together', 'three', 'generations', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'struggles', 'mythical', 'rural', 'town', 'Connecticut', 'came', 'age', 'sexually', 'second', 'story', 'place', '1970', 'can', 'identify', 'only', 'too', 'well', 'what', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'experienced', 'hands', 'fellow', 'bigoted', 'classmates', 'ai', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'courage', 'fortitude', 'showed', 'everyone', 'made', 'feel', 'proud', 'relieved', 'know', 'are', 'people', 'actually', 'real', 'world', 'Common', 'Ground', 'positive', 'note', 'Connecticut', 'actually', 'one', 'first', 'states', 'legalize', 'gay', 'marriage', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'holding', 'wedding', 'similar', 'ceremony', 'place', 'rural', 'Oklahoma', '2/3', 'United', 'States', 'matter', 'struggles', 'previous', 'generations', 'first', 'two', 'stories', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'common', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'places', 'even', 'substantial', 'progress', 'been', 'made', 'West', 'Coast', 'Mid-Atlantic', 'New', 'England', 'Iowa', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'gay', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'rights', 'heartland', 'California', 'Good', 'Iowa', 'Unfortunately', 'struggle', 'fairness', 'common', 'sense', 'continue', 'Few', 'areas', 'person', 'life', 'more', 'personal', 'important', 'one', 'own', 'sexuality', 'wonder', 'how', 'bigoted', 'heterosexuals', 'would', 'feels', 'woke', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'planet', 'were', 'made', 'feel', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'being', 'straight', 'instead', 'let', 'say', 'bisexual', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'engage', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'BOTH', 'genders', 'How', 'strange', 'How', 'odd', 'How', 'could', 'possibly', 'not', 'be', 'sexually', 'attracted', 'genders', 'What', 'wrong', 'lovely', 'fantasy', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'bigot', 'experience', 'can', 'only', 'hope', '2009', 'Common', 'Ground', 'released', 'DVD', 'extremely', 'ridiculous', 'R', 'rating', 'downgraded', 'PG-13', 'realize', 'teenager', 'struggling', 'sexuality', 'could', 'not', 'privately', 'order', 'Common', 'Ground', 'own', 'simply', 'OUTRAGEOUS', 'R', 'rating', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'migrated', 'DVD', 'volumes', 'society', 'utter', 'stupidity', 'when', 'treating', 'Gay', 'Lesbian', 'Bisexual', 'people', 'fairly.See', 'other', 'favorite', 'LGBT', 'films', 'Elliot', 'LovesandLatter', 'Days', 'Unrated', 'Edition']",N/A
569546,A2S29EES9TA9ZM,B000056HQR,hredzak,"[1, 1]","... so I'm not surprised this one never came out on DVD.  What?  No VHS player? lol.  You can find this movie online if you look. (note: only one story focuses on a lesbian- the other two are about gay men)The only reason this movie is on my radar at all is because of where I was when I first saw it.  I first came across this while living abroad years and years ago while walking through a market of random vids with my girlfriend.  In a country where all things gay are hidden away, this was a weird and lucky find (we thought maybe they didn't know what it was, lol).  We thought it was cheesy then but enjoyed it anyway as you will anything American when you're buried abroad long enough... and it was something gay.But I'm so much more spoiled now with the availability of happier stories that I didn't like it too much at all when I saw it again this week.  It was a mix of depressing and hopeful, felt kinda dated, and is drowning in clich&eacute;s. Filmed better than most lez stories you'll find today... just old. Like, the stuff I really don't want to watch anymore.  I appreciate how far we've come, but I prefer the positive stories these days.  I was raised on all the depressing stuff, ya know?Just like If These Walls Could Talk 2, this one follows 3 different generations of lgbt stories.  Only it's got more of a focus on gays as opposed to lesbians.  A one-armed vet in the small town of Homer, Connecticut watches the lives of these gay characters play out along with all the homophobia surrounding them, even as things change over time--  from 1954 to 1974, and finally to 2000.  It's packed with familiar looking stars... which gave me the impression they must of all felt to be a part of something important.  I can appreciate that as well... I just wish the stories were more interesting and less stereotypical.1954:  Brittany Murphy plays the innocent and naive Dorothy... a young woman exploring her sexual identity who is dishonorably discharged from the Navy for ""sexually deviant behavior.""  Jason Priestly plays her handsome gay friend.  The blonde lead from Desert Hearts (Helen Shaver) has a friendly and positive role here.  This was easily the best of the three stories.  Brittany Murphy did a really good job as the shy Dorothy and her first kiss is a sweet one.  I like how it captured the secrecy and gay camaraderie closeted soldiers share... and the insidious hypocrisy that pervades the military.  But it was really hard to watch her whole town ostracize her.1974:  A closeted gay French high school teacher has aspirations to be a principal... but when his best senior student is bullied and beat up for being gay, he knows he must make a stand- even if this will risk his professional future.  This is very stereotypical homophobia.  Still relevant today, I'm sure.  Just not an ounce of originality.  The high schooler is played adorably by handsome Jonathan Taylor Thomas.  The teacher's boyfriend is irritatingly insensitive to what his boyfriend stands to lose. There is a kind of rape scene here.  But nothing about this film is visually graphic at all and you never see anything more than kissing.  I suspect the gentle portrayal of ""gay"" here in every story is a result of not wanting to offend a target straight audience... the message that homophobia is wrong but that times are changing seems to be the primary message here.2000:  Two gay men prepare for their wedding amidst a little drama.  This was mostly boring... even the token lesbians trying to get pregnant planted there couldn't keep my interest.  And did one really run up to the groom at his wedding, right after his wedding kiss, and shove her positive pregnancy stick in his face?  Don't women pee on those things??Each story ended on a hopeful note and got less terrible for characters over time, but what mostly stuck with me overall is the awful and depressing homophobia.2-3 stars",3,the suckier version of If These Walls Could Talk 2,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,3901,"['so', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'one', 'never', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'What', 'VHS', 'player', 'lol', 'can', 'find', 'movie', 'online', 'look', 'note', 'only', 'one', 'story', 'lesbian-', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'gay', 'men', 'only', 'reason', 'movie', 'radar', 'where', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'first', 'came', 'while', 'living', 'abroad', 'years', 'years', 'ago', 'walking', 'market', 'random', 'vids', 'girlfriend', 'country', 'where', 'things', 'gay', 'are', 'hidden', 'away', 'was', 'weird', 'lucky', 'find', 'thought', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'lol', 'thought', 'was', 'cheesy', 'then', 'enjoyed', 'anyway', 'will', 'anything', 'American', 'when', ""'re"", 'buried', 'abroad', 'long', 'enough', 'was', 'something', 'gay.But', ""'m"", 'so', 'much', 'more', 'spoiled', 'now', 'availability', 'happier', 'stories', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'saw', 'again', 'week', 'was', 'mix', 'depressing', 'hopeful', 'felt', 'kinda', 'dated', 'drowning', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Filmed', 'better', 'most', 'lez', 'stories', ""'ll"", 'find', 'today', 'just', 'old', 'stuff', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'anymore', 'appreciate', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'prefer', 'positive', 'stories', 'days', 'was', 'raised', 'depressing', 'stuff', 'ya', 'know', 'Just', 'Walls', 'Could', 'Talk', '2', 'one', '3', 'different', 'generations', 'lgbt', 'stories', 'Only', 'got', 'more', 'focus', 'gays', 'opposed', 'lesbians', 'one-armed', 'vet', 'small', 'town', 'Homer', 'Connecticut', 'lives', 'gay', 'characters', 'play', 'out', 'homophobia', 'surrounding', 'even', 'things', 'change', 'time', '1954', '1974', 'finally', '2000', 'packed', 'familiar', 'looking', 'stars', 'gave', 'impression', 'must', 'felt', 'be', 'part', 'something', 'important', 'can', 'appreciate', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'wish', 'stories', 'were', 'more', 'interesting', 'less', 'stereotypical.1954', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'innocent', 'naive', 'Dorothy', 'young', 'woman', 'exploring', 'sexual', 'identity', 'who', 'dishonorably', 'discharged', 'Navy', 'sexually', 'deviant', 'behavior', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'handsome', 'gay', 'friend', 'blonde', 'lead', 'Desert', 'Hearts', 'Helen', 'Shaver', 'friendly', 'positive', 'role', 'here', 'was', 'easily', 'best', 'three', 'stories', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'shy', 'Dorothy', 'first', 'kiss', 'sweet', 'one', 'how', 'captured', 'secrecy', 'gay', 'camaraderie', 'closeted', 'soldiers', 'share', 'insidious', 'hypocrisy', 'military', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'watch', 'whole', 'town', 'ostracize', 'her.1974', 'closeted', 'gay', 'French', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'aspirations', 'be', 'principal', 'when', 'best', 'senior', 'student', 'bullied', 'beat', 'up', 'being', 'gay', 'must', 'make', 'stand-', 'even', 'will', 'risk', 'professional', 'future', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'homophobia', 'Still', 'relevant', 'today', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Just', 'not', 'ounce', 'originality', 'high', 'schooler', 'played', 'adorably', 'handsome', 'Jonathan', 'Taylor', 'Thomas', 'teacher', 'boyfriend', 'irritatingly', 'insensitive', 'what', 'boyfriend', 'lose', 'kind', 'rape', 'scene', 'here', 'nothing', 'film', 'visually', 'graphic', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'more', 'kissing', 'suspect', 'gentle', 'portrayal', 'gay', 'here', 'story', 'result', 'not', 'wanting', 'offend', 'target', 'straight', 'audience', 'message', 'homophobia', 'wrong', 'times', 'are', 'changing', 'be', 'primary', 'message', 'here.2000', 'Two', 'gay', 'men', 'prepare', 'wedding', 'amidst', 'little', 'drama', 'was', 'mostly', 'boring', 'even', 'token', 'trying', 'get', 'pregnant', 'planted', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'interest', 'did', 'one', 'really', 'run', 'up', 'groom', 'wedding', 'right', 'wedding', 'kiss', 'shove', 'positive', 'pregnancy', 'stick', 'face', 'Do', ""n't"", 'women', 'pee', 'things', 'story', 'ended', 'hopeful', 'note', 'got', 'less', 'terrible', 'characters', 'time', 'what', 'mostly', 'stuck', 'overall', 'awful', 'depressing', 'homophobia.2-3', 'stars']",N/A

569548,A107H3XGCV6Y4Q,B000056HQR,"Paige Turner ""Film Fanatic""","[5, 5]","The stories are timeless and still relevant, even though one takes place in 1954, one in 1974, and the last in 2000. It is a similar format to ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" in which there are three stories from three different generations. The 1954 sequence hits home, in spite of a ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy within the armed services, because even now, a military career can still be irreparably damaged if a soldier or officer is outed. Gay youths can relate to the 1974 story, seeing minimal progress from 1974 to the present with the way GLBT young people are treated by their peers. All one has to do is watch ""The Matthew Shepard Story"" or  ""Boys Don't Cry"" to witness recent cruelty against GLBT youth.The three stories could have easily been made into full-length movies. I especially wanted to learn more about the characters from ""A Friend of Dorothy's."" That story has a lot of potential, and Brittany Murphy was quite effective in her sad, wide-eyed  portrayal of Dorothy Nelson. The phrase, ""A friend of Dorothy's"" was a bit overused in the script; I'm sure gays and lesbians back in 1954 had other code words to communicate their homosexuality other than just proclaiming ""I'm a friend of Dorothy's."" At times the gay cliches became a bit much, which diluted the realism and authenticity of the stories.What  I liked about the film was its positive ending and overall of message of hope and acceptance, in spite of what happened to some of the main characters in the three stories. It is a visually beautiful film and captures the small town feeling.  And the stories are compelling enough to make this an interesting film to purchase and watch. I hope it comes out on DVD with Director's and Screenwriters' commentary.",3,Intro to Gays & Lesbians 101,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,1738,"['stories', 'are', 'timeless', 'still', 'relevant', 'even', 'one', 'place', '1954', 'one', '1974', 'last', '2000', 'similar', 'format', 'Walls', 'Could', 'Talk', '2', 'are', 'three', 'stories', 'three', 'different', 'generations', '1954', 'sequence', 'home', 'spite', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Ask', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'policy', 'armed', 'services', 'even', 'now', 'military', 'career', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'irreparably', 'damaged', 'soldier', 'officer', 'outed', 'Gay', 'youths', 'can', 'relate', '1974', 'story', 'seeing', 'minimal', 'progress', '1974', 'present', 'way', 'GLBT', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'treated', 'peers', 'one', 'do', 'watch', 'Matthew', 'Shepard', 'Story', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'witness', 'recent', 'cruelty', 'GLBT', 'youth.The', 'three', 'stories', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'made', 'full-length', 'movies', 'especially', 'wanted', 'learn', 'more', 'characters', 'A', 'Friend', 'Dorothy', 'story', 'lot', 'potential', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'was', 'quite', 'effective', 'sad', 'wide-eyed', 'portrayal', 'Dorothy', 'Nelson', 'phrase', 'friend', 'Dorothy', 'was', 'bit', 'overused', 'script', ""'m"", 'sure', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'back', '1954', 'had', 'other', 'code', 'words', 'communicate', 'homosexuality', 'other', 'just', 'proclaiming', ""'m"", 'friend', 'Dorothy', 'times', 'gay', 'cliches', 'became', 'bit', 'much', 'diluted', 'realism', 'authenticity', 'stories.What', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'positive', 'ending', 'overall', 'message', 'hope', 'acceptance', 'spite', 'what', 'happened', 'main', 'characters', 'three', 'stories', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'film', 'small', 'town', 'feeling', 'stories', 'are', 'compelling', 'enough', 'make', 'interesting', 'film', 'purchase', 'watch', 'hope', 'out', 'DVD', 'Director', 'Screenwriters', 'commentary']",N/A

The fear that is displayed by Weber as a closeted teacher is very realistic and the treatment of the young gayTaylor-Thomas character was also true to the time period if not true today.I highly recommend this film to anyone who is confused about their sexuality, have friends who are confused or family members who do not accept your sexuality.
