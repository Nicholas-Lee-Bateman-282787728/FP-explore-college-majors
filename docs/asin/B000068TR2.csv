706067,A5UGX57EV695M,B000068TR2,Kenneth M. Pizzi,"[6, 8]","Wow!  What an unusual and oftentimes disturbing film this is with excellent performances all around from Perkins, Bronson, and Ireland in this tale about a twisted neurologist (Perkins)whose wife's infidelity prompts him to manipulate an amenesiac (Bronson), into killing his wife and her lover.Perkins is well-cast in this role as the doctor who takes Bronson both into his care and confidence later managing to convince him that Ireland is his wife and is having an affair with a French journalist.  An unusual role for Bronson, typically regulated to B pictures and action roles, this film showcases his tremendous range where the director has successfully cast him against type. In this case, the victim.Like ""Lola"" with Susan George filmed a year earlier and directed by Richard Donner, Bronson played a 38 year old author of ""adult literature"" who marries the 16 year old Susan George--a stretch for an actor of mostly B action pictures like ""Death Wish"" and ""The Evil That Men Do.""This film shot on the southern coast of England, as did ""Lola,"" captures another facet of this actor's gifts.  This would be one of many pictures where he would collaborate with his wife, Jill Ireland.Perkins is superb as the disturbed neurologist who finds solace in the opening bars of Dvorak's ""New World Symphony"" and toy puzzles.  Perkins always brings a neurotic intensity to any role, and this is no exception. The ending is one that is shocking as well as unexpected.The quality of this DVD is excellent for a film over 30 years old. The transfers from the 16mm print are remarkably clean, and the audio is remastered to Dolby standards. Beware of cheaper versions of this DVD that look like they were taken from a VHS tape.",5,"Redefines the concept of ""mind games""....",1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,1720,"['Wow', 'What', 'unusual', 'disturbing', 'film', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Perkins', 'Bronson', 'Ireland', 'tale', 'twisted', 'neurologist', 'Perkins', 'wife', 'infidelity', 'manipulate', 'amenesiac', 'Bronson', 'killing', 'wife', 'lover.Perkins', 'well-cast', 'role', 'doctor', 'who', 'Bronson', 'care', 'confidence', 'later', 'managing', 'convince', 'Ireland', 'wife', 'having', 'affair', 'French', 'journalist', 'unusual', 'role', 'Bronson', 'typically', 'regulated', 'B', 'pictures', 'action', 'roles', 'film', 'tremendous', 'range', 'where', 'director', 'successfully', 'cast', 'type', 'case', 'victim.Like', 'Lola', 'Susan', 'George', 'filmed', 'year', 'earlier', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Bronson', 'played', '38', 'year', 'old', 'author', 'adult', 'literature', 'who', '16', 'year', 'old', 'Susan', 'George', 'stretch', 'actor', 'mostly', 'B', 'action', 'pictures', 'Death', 'Wish', 'Evil', 'Men', 'Do', 'film', 'shot', 'southern', 'coast', 'England', 'did', 'Lola', 'facet', 'actor', 'gifts', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'many', 'pictures', 'where', 'would', 'collaborate', 'wife', 'Jill', 'Ireland.Perkins', 'superb', 'disturbed', 'neurologist', 'who', 'solace', 'opening', 'bars', 'Dvorak', 'New', 'World', 'Symphony', 'toy', 'puzzles', 'Perkins', 'always', 'neurotic', 'intensity', 'role', 'exception', 'ending', 'one', 'shocking', 'as', 'well', 'unexpected.The', 'quality', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'film', '30', 'years', 'old', 'transfers', '16mm', 'print', 'are', 'remarkably', 'clean', 'audio', 'remastered', 'Dolby', 'standards', 'Beware', 'cheaper', 'versions', 'DVD', 'look', 'were', 'taken', 'VHS', 'tape']",N/A

I was a huge Bronson fan and said &quot;what the hell&quot; and got it. The title and cover did not make the film too appealing, but I was actually taken by total surprise by the film. Fans of Bronson's action films, don't expect the same here. This is more of a thought provoking thriller. What got me the most is the great performances by Bronson, Perkins, and Bronson's then wife . The story centers on brain sergon Anthony Perkins finding amnesia victim Bronson. Perkins takes him in for care and somehow convices him to murder his wife. The ending is spactacular. Smartly written and moves at a brisk pace. Though this is one of Bronson's more obsecure films, it well worth for fans to check out. This one his rarities that he made while in Italy.
