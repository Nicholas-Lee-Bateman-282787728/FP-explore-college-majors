480606,A1IDQAVGGXBYS7,6305837538,David L Jones,"[2, 2]","I found this an extremely interesting documentary on The Studio, (as it was known before it's slew of Drew Barrymore vehicles, where she plays a virgin... again.) It was also fairly entertaining. The DVD, however, is recommended, in my humble opinion, to only those who are self-acknowledged movie buffs, or were alive at the time of Fox's first 50 years, or who are just FOX-y people. This is not recommended for the casual viewer, but for the viewer with the specific requirements mentioned. On the plus side, there are many insights into both The Studio and early film-making in general, and also featured are dailies from various Marilyn Monroe films of her 'goofing up' during her more traumatic years.",4,"Movie buffs, old timers, and foxy people only!",1000339200,"09 13, 2001",2001,707,"['found', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'Studio', 'was', 'known', 'slew', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'vehicles', 'where', 'virgin', 'again', 'was', 'also', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'DVD', 'however', 'recommended', 'humble', 'opinion', 'only', 'who', 'are', 'self-acknowledged', 'movie', 'buffs', 'were', 'alive', 'time', 'Fox', 'first', '50', 'years', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'FOX-y', 'people', 'not', 'recommended', 'casual', 'viewer', 'viewer', 'specific', 'requirements', 'mentioned', 'plus', 'side', 'are', 'many', 'insights', 'Studio', 'early', 'film-making', 'general', 'also', 'featured', 'are', 'dailies', 'various', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'films', ""'goofing"", 'up', 'more', 'traumatic', 'years']",N/A
480607,A3V1ARVPHYOZJS,6305837538,"D. S. Wymore ""Golden Age of Hollywood fan""","[1, 1]","I purchased this DVD for two reasons: 1.) because I'm a big fan of the films of Twentieth Century Fox from the 1930s and 2.) I teach a scenic art class that focuses on painting scenery for film and television production. The DVD has many behind the scenes footage of a working film studio from that era - everything from the carpentry shops to the wardrobe department to the commissary. Since part of my classes features a short history lesson of the film studios of that era, this footage is extremely helpful in demonstrating what it was like to work in a film studio back then. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has an interest in the workings of a major film studio during the Studio Era. It also has many clips from Fox films that have never seen the light of day on VHS or DVD.",4,Great for reference material,1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,790,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'two', 'reasons', '1', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'films', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', '1930s', '2', 'teach', 'scenic', 'art', 'class', 'painting', 'scenery', 'film', 'television', 'production', 'DVD', 'many', 'scenes', 'footage', 'working', 'film', 'studio', 'era', 'everything', 'carpentry', 'wardrobe', 'department', 'commissary', 'part', 'classes', 'short', 'history', 'lesson', 'film', 'studios', 'era', 'footage', 'extremely', 'helpful', 'demonstrating', 'what', 'was', 'work', 'film', 'studio', 'back', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'interest', 'workings', 'major', 'film', 'studio', 'Studio', 'Era', 'also', 'many', 'clips', 'Fox', 'films', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'VHS', 'DVD']",N/A
