998822,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000G5SIEO,calvinnme,"[5, 5]","Season 5 of Roseanne starts out on a very morose note that corresponds to the deep recession the country was suffering at the time these shows were aired in 1992. Dan's motorcycle shop is failing and will have to be closed in order for him to salvage the mortgage on the Conner home. Rodbell's , the diner in the mall where Roseanne has worked for two years, is closing too, due to business in the mall being so bad. In order to make ends meet, the kids' college fund has been depleted so that Becky, while filling out college applications, throws a fit when she asks her parents about this fund and finds it no longer exists. Like any typical teenager, she is very upset when the harsh realities of life actually have an impact on her individual plans. Thus, she elopes with boyfriend Mark and moves to Minnesota, since with the closing of Dan's shop, Mark is unemployed too. Before she leaves though, she says some hurtful words to her father that basically blame all of the family's problems on him saying that her life has been ruined because Dan is a bad businessman. Everything hits rock bottom when the electric company turns off the power in ""The Dark Ages"", with Roseanne remarking that ""Well, middle class was fun.""The Conner family luck takes an abrupt turn upward when Roseanne's mother, having just finished divorcing Roseanne's father, decides to move back to Lanford and gives both Jackie and Roseanne each ten thousand dollars to do with as they please. Ultimately, though, even this is not enough for the two sisters to do what they really want - open up a diner in a now vacant building. Thus, they reluctantly invite their mother in as a partner in their business venture. She ultimately says yes - but not until she gives their dream her usual shellacking that she sees as motherly advice but comes across as disapproval bordering on contempt. With Becky now departed from the show, the role of David, Mark's brother and Darlene's girlfriend, is increased. We get a good look at his verbally abusive and often absentee mother in the Christmas episode, and his rocky home life is ultimately responsible for Roseanne taking David in to live with the Conners. The season concludes with Dan taking a job as supervisor with the city so that he can have a regular paycheck with benefits after Roseanne cracks a tooth, and the family has no dental insurance. Also, Darlene makes the announcement that she wants to go to school in Chicago where she can finish high school and begin college early at a really good writing school. This announcement is met with absolute resistance at first, but her parents soon realize that keeping Darlene at home will not bring Becky back to them, and they finally grant their permission. This sets up Sarah Gilbert in a recurring role for the rest of the series, since in reality she actually was starting college in the fall of 1993.There are some other outstanding individual episodes too, including the two-parter where Roseanne discovers that Jackie's younger boyfriend, who seems like Mr. Wonderful in public, has actually been beating her. Even though Jackie is an ex-cop she takes on the typical stance of an abused girlfriend by blaming the violence on herself. When Dan finds out, he decides to teach the young man a lesson with his own fists. Also, in another outstanding episode, Roseanne's father dies and she winds up sharing a drink with a woman who turns out to have been her father's mistress.Although I thought this season was excellent overall, there were a couple of points that bothered me.First off, there actually was a VERY bad recession going on in 1992, and I compliment the show for incorporating it into the storyline. However, the Conners' troubles came on very suddenly and were resolved with a very pat answer. In retrospect, it all seemed like a somewhat contrived attempt to help Bill Clinton get elected. Just as homeless people didn't seem to exist on TV until Ronald Reagan was elected president, it seemed like everyone in Lanford was on the road to starvation until the outcome of the 1992 election seemed inevitable, and then economic conditions suddenly normalized.The second point of contention is the sudden transformation of Roseanne's father into an abusive individual as pointed out in Roseanne and Jackie's comments during the episode in which he dies, and also in the episodes in which Roseanne compares David's horrible parents to her own parents. When Roseanne's parents came to visit at the end of season one, they both seemed like very nice but very annoying people, taking over the Conners' bedroom during their visit, and then waking them at 4:30 in the morning because this is the time of day that Roseanne's father must eat breakfast every morning, no matter what. There was no mention of any childhood trauma. This just seemed like Roseanne writing into the script the accusations she was making at that time about her own father, even if meant abandoning previous characterizations.However, these are minor points, and I feel the show handled all of the cast changes very well. I highly recommend this season of Roseanne to all who count themselves as fans of the show.",5,Another excellent season of Roseanne handles lots of changes,1156204800,"08 22,

But they did mention Roseanne's fathers abuse in the fourth season episode ""This Old House""  Roseanne and Jackie went to the house they grew up in before it was torn down and were discussing the things that went on during childhood.  Roseanne pointed to the wall and said to Jackie ""Remember what was hanging there?""  Referring to the belt they were hit with.  Roseanne also referred to her dad as a lunatic in the Tornado episode from the 1st season when Jackie said he used to get them all in the car during a storm and chase it.  They changed the character of Dan's mother also.  I think in the second season Dan's mother comes to Thanksgiving with her boyfriend and seemed like a perfectly normal woman and in a later season she had mental problems and was put in a hospital.  Then Debbie Reynolds played her as a psycho.  David's name started as Kevin.  They might have cleared that up in a later episode though.  And of course the two Beckys.  All in all Roseanne was a great show and I am thrilled that they are bringing them out on DVD so quickly.  I gave only 4 stars because I felt the 2nd 3rd and 4th seasons were the best, although I absolutely love the episode on this one where the power is turned off.  That has some of the biggest laughs of the entire series.  I would place Roseanne in my top 5 series of all time.  Even the lesser episodes are better than most things on TV.

In the previous season, Roseanne's video commentary was for the full episode--this time, the episodes are condensed so that there are no long puases between comments. LADIES runs 14 minutes and LANDFORD runs 18. Even condensed, most of the screen time is just Roseanne watching the episode and lauighing. I wish in future Roseanne would share the screen (or just audio commentary) with another member of the cast, which I'm sure would make the commentary much more lively as the two or more people would bounce off each other (liek the huge cast and crew commentaries on NEWSRADIO or even Angie Dickinson and Earl Holliman's dual commentaries on POLICE WOMAN).
