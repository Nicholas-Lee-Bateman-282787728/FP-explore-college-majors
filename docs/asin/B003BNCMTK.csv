While I'm glad to have the rest of this series, and while the episodes are watchable in terms of sound and picture quality, they were not cleaned up much, if at all (I am watching on a 42 inch LCD). I got my set for less than $20 at Sam's and so feel like I got a good deal in terms of what I paid. But I am disappointed in the picture quality overall. Though they cram a lot of episodes on each disc (and it is strange that the discs are not numbered), compression doesn't seem the big problem (slow drifting smoke doesn't present a lot of artifacts)--the problem is less-than-pristine prints. If you're a fan of the series, I'd recommend paying no more than $20 because the picture quality doesn't warrant more. But great to have these wonderful shows.

1335960,A3V1ARVPHYOZJS,B003BNCMTK,"D. S. Wymore ""Golden Age of Hollywood fan""","[8, 9]","Five stars for the television show; 1 star for the packaging!  Alias Smith and Jones is my favorite television show of all time and has been since I was 15. I haven't seen any of the episodes since they originally aired in 1971 so it was wonderful to view them all over again. Since I was a teenager at the time, I didn't realize how many stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood appeared on the show (Rudy Vallee, George Montgomery, Walter Brennan, Craig Stevens, Don Ameche, Cesar Romero, etc... - each a delight to see).  I could go on and on with my thoughts about the program but I think this space is better used to say a few things about the DVD product itself. First: the print used of ""The Day They Hanged Kid Curry"" is not up to snuff. It's faded, has bad color balance and a lot of dirt and scratches. However, you have to bear in mind that this episode was probably supposed to air twice and, due to length, probably not in syndication. Therefore, the original print was probably not maintained as pristine as the rest of the series. Second: whoever wrote the liner notes on the back of the DVDs obviously never watched the show, nor did the person who proofread the liner prior to going to print. If they had watched the show, they would know that Roger Davis replaced Pete Duel as the Hannibal Heyes character (NOT Kid Curry), as written on the liner notes of Disc 4, episode 2 (The Biggest Game in the West).  Third: the packaging itself is very bare bones - no extras, no fun photos, no interviews and the box itself is flimsy. It would've made the DVD set a little extra special  if there was an interview with Ben Murphy and Roger Davis. What a missed opportunity! Forth: Academy Award winner Anne Baxter is NOT in the episode Shootout at Diablo Station as indicated on the liner notes - it is Anne Archer. Timeless Video/ Universal Studios/ NBC - you ought to be embarrassed! That  liner notes writer and proofreader need to be reassigned to different jobs - or maybe even fired.",5,My favorite TV show ever!

Also the episodes while not bad quality are not as good as the ones I have taped off encore.

It is a great show.  One of my favorites.  I am a big Pete Duel fan.  So sad he died.  The show is great and I love the acton, the acting and everything about it.  BUT... YOU KNOW THAT WAS COMING. BUT... The packaging is horrible.  And there are no extras on it.  Not even a tribute to Pete Duel.  Even on the Gidget TV show  DVD Sally Fields talks about Pete Duel.  He was a regualar on that show also.  The box is flimsy and the cases are hard to get out.  This doesnt mean you should not  get it.  It is a GREAT SHOW. To bad Universal didn't release it.  Perhaps they didnt know all the loyal fans it has.  Now for the rest of the BUT.  After Pete Duel died, the show went down hill.  I like Roger Davis, but he is not right for the part for a number of reasns.  1.  He looks like Chuck Conners and I keep thinking of the Rifleman when seeing him.  2.  His looks are not a contrast to Ben Murphy, also a blond.  The show tries to make up for this by saying they are now cousins.  Doesnt work for me.  3.  Hannibal is suppose to be the brains of the two.  Roger  doesnt pull it off like Pete did.  Pete Duel had that con artist smile that told you he was pulling the wool over someone's eyes.  Plus Pete Duel was  a better actor then Roer Davis.  The show also tried to bring in a female quality near the end.  True, Sally Fields was in some of the early episodes, and was brought back, but trying to put Michelle Lee in as George didnt work for me.  She didnt have the same chemestry that Sally had with the two. When Sally Fields did come back she was in an episdoe called  ""The Clementine Ingredient"" which also had Alejandro  Rey in it.

Sadly after shooting the 18th episode and while on break actor Pete Duel killed himself leaving the popular series without finished dialogue for some scenes (voice actor Paul Frees came in and dubbed Duel's voice for these scenes)and five episodes short of what was ordered. Actor Roger Davis (who had auditioned for Hannibal Heyes but lost the role to Duel ending up as the opening narrator for the series)replaced Duel for the remaining five episodes and the show--still popular although fans were still reeling from the death of Duel--was renewed for a third season.Sadly, the first season set didn't sell as well as Universal had hoped so they licensed it out to another company giving them access to the transfers that they had prepared for seasons two and three. One of the problems with a show licensed from a studio is that there isn't much money (or the company releasing it doesn't feel as if it is worthwhile to spend the money since they don't own the show)to clean up the series for home video.The image quality is fairly shoddy due to 1) overcompression (i.e., too many episodes per disc--six)and 2)the varying conditions of episodes (the two hour second season premiere looks like it was pulled from a 16mm syndication print and has black leader spliced in for missing frames as the fake Kid Curry is led to the gallows--although others look like they are from the 35mm but with no restoration/clean up). Skin tones are a bit too pink and colors are generally washed out looking. Blacks are crushed and detail is murky in many episodes.Aliasing is a problem through the set which wasn't as big an issue with the original Universal release of the first season. There's also plenty of video noise sprinkled throughout the set.The original mono audio sounds fine although it would have been nice to include closed captioning or subtitles as an option for the series for those members of the audience who are getting up there in years.It's a pity that there aren't any additional extras such as commentary tracks from those who worked on the show discussing the issues that dogged the series by the end of season two and the final season (I did my own podcast for the two hour movie second season premiere, the last episode with Duel and the first with Roger Davis as a gift to friends who had the set).It's too bad that Timeless didn't elect to put less episodes per disc (4 or 5 would have been the maximum)and that Universal didn't use the high def versions that aired on the Encore Western Channel as they looked better.",3,Seminal series receives a shoddy transfer to DVD for seasons 2 & 3,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,2822,"['4', 'stars', 'series2', 'stars', 'presentation', 'DVD-read', 'below', 'Alias', 'Smith', 'Jones', 'chugged', 'locomotive', 'top', 'speed', 'starting', 'TV', 'movie', 'then', 'turned', 'midseason', 'replacement', 'show', 'became', 'so', 'popular', 'ABC', 'immediately', 'renewed', 'series', 'season', 'two', 'Sadly', 'shooting', '18th', 'episode', 'break', 'actor', 'Pete', 'Duel', 'killed', 'leaving', 'popular', 'series', 'finished', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'voice', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Frees', 'came', 'dubbed', 'Duel', 'voice', 'scenes', 'five', 'episodes', 'short', 'what', 'was', 'ordered', 'Actor', 'Roger', 'Davis', 'who', 'had', 'auditioned', 'Hannibal', 'Heyes', 'lost', 'role', 'Duel', 'ending', 'up', 'opening', 'narrator', 'series', 'replaced', 'Duel', 'remaining', 'five', 'episodes', 'show', 'still', 'popular', 'fans', 'were', 'still', 'reeling', 'death', 'Duel', 'was', 'renewed', 'third', 'season.Sadly', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'as', 'well', 'Universal', 'had', 'hoped', 'so', 'licensed', 'out', 'company', 'giving', 'access', 'transfers', 'had', 'prepared', 'seasons', 'two', 'three', 'One', 'problems', 'show', 'licensed', 'studio', ""n't"", 'much', 'money', 'company', 'releasing', ""n't"", 'feel', 'worthwhile', 'spend', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'show', 'clean', 'up', 'series', 'home', 'video.The', 'image', 'quality', 'fairly', 'shoddy', 'due', '1', 'overcompression', 'i.e.', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'disc', 'six', '2', 'varying', 'conditions', 'episodes', 'two', 'hour', 'second', 'season', 'premiere', 'was', 'pulled', '16mm', 'syndication', 'print', 'black', 'leader', 'spliced', 'missing', 'frames', 'fake', 'Kid', 'Curry', 'led', 'gallows', 'others', 'look', 'are', '35mm', 'restoration/clean', 'up', 'Skin', 'tones', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'pink', 'colors', 'are', 'generally', 'washed', 'out', 'looking', 'Blacks', 'are', 'crushed', 'detail', 'murky', 'many', 'episodes.Aliasing', 'problem', 'set', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'big', 'issue', 'original', 'Universal', 'release', 'first', 'season', 'also', 'plenty', 'video', 'noise', 'sprinkled', 'set.The', 'original', 'mono', 'audio', 'fine', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'include', 'closed', 'captioning', 'subtitles', 'option', 'series', 'members', 'audience', 'who', 'are', 'getting', 'up', 'there', 'years.It', 'pity', 'are', ""n't"", 'additional', 'extras', 'such', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'who', 'worked', 'show', 'discussing', 'issues', 'dogged', 'series', 'end', 'season', 'two', 'final', 'season', 'did', 'own', 'podcast', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'second', 'season', 'premiere', 'last', 'episode', 'Duel', 'first', 'Roger', 'Davis', 'gift', 'friends', 'who', 'had', 'set', '.It', 'too', 'bad', 'Timeless', 'did', ""n't"", 'elect', 'put', 'less', 'episodes', 'disc', '4', '5', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'maximum', 'Universal', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'high', 'def', 'versions', 'aired', 'Encore', 'Western', 'Channel', 'looked', 'better']",N/A
