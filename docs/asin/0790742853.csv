I just happened to be watching TV the other day (something I rarely do) and it was on.  I had totally forgot what a great movie it was!  I was seriously mesmerized for an hour.  The songs just took me back.  I didn't see the beginning so I went on a search to find it.  I figured Amazon wouldn't have the DVD and soundtrack, but, voila! That's why I love them.

111280,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,0790742853,Bobby Underwood,"[1, 1]","When this very special film begins, Billy Wyatt is adrift, further away from the promising ballplayer he once was than he has ever been. The most wonderful person in his life has just committed suicide. She was his babysitter and first crush growing up. She was also his compass and beacon towards all that mattered in life. She has left him her red VW convertible, and something far more personal; her ashes.Jodie Foster has a truly magical turn as the troubled free spirit, Katie. Foster's Katie is one of her most memorable performances, capturing perfectly a free soul just a little different, and a little more wonderful, than everyone else. She was always the one to point Billy in the right direction and is doing so one last time, posthumously. Mark Harmon does a nice job as the adult Billy, lost more than ever now that Katie has died.Katie has killed herself at Seascape, the fondly remembered second home and hangout of his youth. Much of the film takes place as he makes the journey back home by train, remembering in bittersweet fashion this magical soul who meant so very much to his life. Their free-spirited drives always got them into trouble, but always made his life better somehow. She comforts him during a family tragedy and on his birthday gives him a silver chain with a baseball, telling him: ""It's who you are Billy. You're a ballplayer.""Only Katie knew. But what Billy doesn't know, is what to do with her ashes. He knows she would not have entrusted him with something so important unless she knew it was he who would know what to do with them. But he is at a loss. Billy almost gives up finding the perfect spot for her ashes until he suddenly recalls a memory so revealing, he understands why Katie did what she did. There are images of Foster's Katie in this film that will quietly stay with you for the rest of your life.Harold Ramis as Billy's lifelong best friend Alan Appleby is terrific here, and the always great Blair Brown as Billy's mother, Ginny, help lift this already special film to near greatness. It is wistful and nostalgic, a melancholy atmosphere augmented by David Foster's beautiful score, as evocative as any in memory. A great 60's soundtrack is mingled in also, but it is Foster's opening music and his ""When We Danced"" which will haunt the viewer long after the closing credits. A wistful mood and magical performance by Jodie Foster make this a film not to be missed.",5,Katie's Theme,1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,2424,"['When', 'very', 'special', 'film', 'begins', 'Billy', 'Wyatt', 'adrift', 'further', 'away', 'promising', 'ballplayer', 'once', 'was', 'ever', 'been', 'most', 'wonderful', 'person', 'life', 'just', 'committed', 'suicide', 'was', 'babysitter', 'first', 'crush', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'also', 'compass', 'beacon', 'towards', 'mattered', 'life', 'left', 'red', 'VW', 'convertible', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'personal', 'ashes.Jodie', 'Foster', 'truly', 'magical', 'turn', 'troubled', 'free', 'spirit', 'Katie', 'Foster', 'Katie', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'capturing', 'perfectly', 'free', 'soul', 'just', 'little', 'different', 'little', 'more', 'wonderful', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'point', 'Billy', 'right', 'direction', 'doing', 'so', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'posthumously', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'nice', 'job', 'adult', 'Billy', 'lost', 'more', 'ever', 'now', 'Katie', 'died.Katie', 'killed', 'Seascape', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'second', 'home', 'hangout', 'youth', 'Much', 'film', 'place', 'journey', 'back', 'home', 'train', 'remembering', 'bittersweet', 'fashion', 'magical', 'soul', 'who', 'meant', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'life', 'free-spirited', 'drives', 'always', 'got', 'trouble', 'always', 'made', 'life', 'better', 'somehow', 'family', 'tragedy', 'birthday', 'silver', 'chain', 'baseball', 'telling', 'who', 'are', 'Billy', ""'re"", 'ballplayer', 'Only', 'Katie', 'knew', 'what', 'Billy', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'ashes', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'entrusted', 'something', 'so', 'important', 'knew', 'was', 'who', 'would', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'loss', 'Billy', 'almost', 'up', 'finding', 'perfect', 'spot', 'ashes', 'suddenly', 'memory', 'so', 'revealing', 'why', 'Katie', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'are', 'images', 'Foster', 'Katie', 'film', 'will', 'quietly', 'stay', 'rest', 'life.Harold', 'Ramis', 'Billy', 'lifelong', 'best', 'friend', 'Alan', 'Appleby', 'terrific', 'here', 'always', 'great', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'Billy', 'mother', 'Ginny', 'help', 'lift', 'already', 'special', 'film', 'greatness', 'wistful', 'nostalgic', 'melancholy', 'atmosphere', 'augmented', 'David', 'Foster', 'beautiful', 'score', 'as', 'evocative', 'memory', 'great', '60', 'soundtrack', 'mingled', 'also', 'Foster', 'opening', 'music', 'When', 'Danced', 'will', 'haunt', 'viewer', 'long', 'closing', 'credits', 'wistful', 'mood', 'magical', 'performance', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'make', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

111282,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,0790742853,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[3, 3]","I first saw this film in the movie theatre and liked it a lot.  The other day, I saw it on the shelf @ the pharmacy and was feeling nostalgic, so I picked it up.  This is a PERFECT movie for anyone who happens to be in a nostalgic mood!The plot centers around a burned-out baseball player (Mark Harmon) who is tasked with finding the final place of burial for an old friend's ashes.  The old friend is Katie (Jodie Foster), who was his babysitter as he grew up during the 1960s.  Katie committed suicide, which is a bit of a gender role-reversal;  most movies which deal with suicides are stories of men ending their own lives.  After all, men are FAR more prone to suicide than women are.The story has plenty of flashbacks to his boyhood and teenage years - back when he spent time with Katie.  She had a tremendous influence on his life, and Nietzsche would label her as a sort of un-restrained Dionysian character.For myself, I could very much relate to the flashbacks where things seemed SO close to perfection, and yet any sort of sustained happiness was just out-of-reach.  That is a motif that is more than relevant to my life.The soundtrack was written by David Foster (St. Elmo's Fire) and is a classic 80s soundtrack.  In fact, I have owned the soundtrack for several yrs on CD as I liked it so much.The time of the movie is rather interesting in that Jodie Foster was making the transition from her childhood actress years of doing Disney-type movies to becoming an accomplished and serious actress.  There are many actresses in Hollywood who are more glamorous than Foster, but few can match her in acting skills.  I would very much like to meet her one day for a cup of coffee as it's obvious that she has a lot of depth to her personality.This is a well-done movie, and the usually stoic Mark Harmon turns in perhaps his best performance.  Harold Ramis (The Ghost Busters - The Complete Series (Filmation, Live Action) (1975)), Blair Brown (Altered States) also star, and a young Helen Hunt makes a cameo appearance.Many people will call this movie sappy, and that's not altogether unfair.  However, sometimes sappy movies can be good movies, and this is a good movie (in my mind).  If you loathe films which ooze nostalgia, this one is likely not for you.Ultimately, the title of the movie doubles as both a baseball maneuver as well as well as a symbol of how we must sometimes take chances in life in order to truly feel alive & vibrant.  To paraphrase Rilke, the best life is one where one ""lives dangerously.""",5,Waxing nostalgic,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,2528,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'movie', 'theatre', 'liked', 'lot', 'other', 'day', 'saw', 'shelf', 'pharmacy', 'was', 'feeling', 'nostalgic', 'picked', 'up', 'PERFECT', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'be', 'nostalgic', 'mood', 'plot', 'centers', 'burned-out', 'baseball', 'player', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'who', 'tasked', 'finding', 'final', 'place', 'burial', 'old', 'friend', 'ashes', 'old', 'friend', 'Katie', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'was', 'babysitter', 'grew', 'up', '1960s', 'Katie', 'committed', 'suicide', 'bit', 'gender', 'role-reversal', 'most', 'movies', 'deal', 'suicides', 'are', 'stories', 'men', 'ending', 'own', 'lives', 'men', 'are', 'FAR', 'more', 'prone', 'suicide', 'women', 'are.The', 'story', 'plenty', 'flashbacks', 'boyhood', 'teenage', 'years', 'back', 'when', 'spent', 'time', 'Katie', 'had', 'tremendous', 'influence', 'life', 'Nietzsche', 'would', 'label', 'sort', 'un-restrained', 'Dionysian', 'character.For', 'could', 'very', 'much', 'relate', 'flashbacks', 'where', 'things', 'seemed', 'SO', 'close', 'perfection', 'yet', 'sort', 'sustained', 'happiness', 'was', 'just', 'out-of-reach', 'motif', 'more', 'relevant', 'life.The', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'written', 'David', 'Foster', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'classic', '80s', 'soundtrack', 'fact', 'have', 'owned', 'soundtrack', 'several', 'yrs', 'CD', 'liked', 'much.The', 'time', 'movie', 'rather', 'interesting', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'was', 'making', 'transition', 'childhood', 'actress', 'years', 'doing', 'Disney-type', 'movies', 'becoming', 'accomplished', 'serious', 'actress', 'are', 'many', 'actresses', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'glamorous', 'Foster', 'few', 'can', 'match', 'acting', 'skills', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'meet', 'one', 'day', 'cup', 'coffee', 'obvious', 'lot', 'depth', 'personality.This', 'well-done', 'movie', 'usually', 'stoic', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'perhaps', 'best', 'performance', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'Ghost', 'Busters', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Filmation', 'Live', 'Action', '1975', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'Altered', 'States', 'also', 'star', 'young', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'cameo', 'appearance.Many', 'people', 'will', 'call', 'movie', 'sappy', 'not', 'altogether', 'unfair', 'However', 'sometimes', 'sappy', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'movies', 'good', 'movie', 'mind', 'loathe', 'films', 'ooze', 'nostalgia', 'one', 'likely', 'not', 'you.Ultimately', 'title', 'movie', 'baseball', 'maneuver', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'well', 'symbol', 'how', 'must', 'sometimes', 'take', 'chances', 'life', 'order', 'truly', 'feel', 'alive', 'vibrant', 'paraphrase', 'Rilke', 'best', 'life', 'one', 'where', 'one', 'dangerously']",N/A

111285,A3QP1LM5A0PRXG,0790742853,J. Moore,"[3, 3]","This film is not perfect by any means.  It covers many years, and it often features Mark Harmon staring off into space as he remembers his past.  (That does get a bit old after the few first flashback sequences).  During these years, some of the storylines are a bit farfetched.  (His friend's escapades with an older redhead while at a summer beach house are particularly strained).  And after a beautiful, touching moment at the end of the film, they tack on a strange sequence at a ballpark that ends abruptly and oddly.HOWEVER, even with these flaws, this is still a movie that I cannot forget.  It touches on a lot of deep and emotional subjects, such as death, family, friends, depression, and most importantly love.  The relationship between BIlly and Katie at the center of this film is so ""real"" that all of the other storylines seem to disappear.  The relationship's progress--from babysitter and child, to teenage friends and lovers, and ultimately to Billy being responsible for her ashes after her death--is flawless in its realism.  The many memorable moments in this relationship will touch you and stay with you for a long time (Katie and Billy getting caught smoking and driving during one of her babysitting adventures--Billy asks ""What do we do?""  She shrugs, ciagrette in her mouth, and says ""Wave!"";  Katie and Billy jumping into a pool to ""touch the drain"" so he can feel better during a sad moment in the film;  Billy putting his hand on Katie's leg as a child and then again as a teenager, getting two very different responses each time).I truly believe this is one of Jodie Foster's best, most underrated roles.  She needs to  come across as a carefree, fun loving person who underneath it all is very sad and lonely.  Sounds tough, but she succeeds with ease--you can somehow see her depression through all of her smiles.  This comes across perfectly towards the end of the film, when Billy remembers a moment he shared with Katie on a seashore dock.  She is smiling, and waving her arms through the air at the end of the dock overlooking the ocean.  She's talking about how she would love one day to be like a bird and fly through the air, swoop down over the caves and caverns, touch the bottom of the ocean and meet her lover there, and on and on.  More than anything, she's just talking about how she'd love to experience love and freedom to its fullest.  Watch her carefully as she finishes her speech--her face changes from excitement and happiness to the saddest, most longing expression you'll ever see from an actress, all in a matter of seconds as she says sadly ""God I wish I could do that.....""  It's perfect, and only Jodie could have done it with such finesse.Please watch this movie, even if you've never heard of it.  Try to overlook some of its flaws and focus on the main relationship, and you'll definitely remember it and watch it repeatedly for years to come.",5,Not Flawless--but You'll Always Remember It,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,2906,"['film', 'not', 'perfect', 'means', 'many', 'years', 'often', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'staring', 'off', 'space', 'past', 'get', 'bit', 'old', 'few', 'first', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'years', 'storylines', 'are', 'bit', 'farfetched', 'friend', 'escapades', 'older', 'redhead', 'summer', 'beach', 'house', 'are', 'particularly', 'strained', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'moment', 'end', 'film', 'tack', 'strange', 'sequence', 'ballpark', 'abruptly', 'even', 'flaws', 'still', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'lot', 'deep', 'emotional', 'subjects', 'such', 'death', 'family', 'friends', 'depression', 'most', 'importantly', 'love', 'relationship', 'BIlly', 'Katie', 'center', 'film', 'so', 'real', 'other', 'storylines', 'seem', 'disappear', 'relationship', 'progress', 'babysitter', 'child', 'teenage', 'friends', 'lovers', 'ultimately', 'Billy', 'being', 'responsible', 'ashes', 'death', 'flawless', 'realism', 'many', 'memorable', 'moments', 'relationship', 'will', 'touch', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'Katie', 'Billy', 'getting', 'caught', 'smoking', 'driving', 'one', 'babysitting', 'adventures', 'Billy', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'ciagrette', 'mouth', 'Wave', 'Katie', 'Billy', 'jumping', 'pool', 'touch', 'drain', 'can', 'feel', 'better', 'sad', 'moment', 'film', 'Billy', 'putting', 'hand', 'Katie', 'leg', 'child', 'then', 'again', 'teenager', 'getting', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'responses', 'time', '.I', 'truly', 'believe', 'one', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'best', 'most', 'underrated', 'roles', 'come', 'carefree', 'fun', 'loving', 'person', 'who', 'very', 'sad', 'lonely', 'Sounds', 'tough', 'ease', 'can', 'somehow', 'see', 'depression', 'smiles', 'across', 'perfectly', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Billy', 'moment', 'shared', 'Katie', 'seashore', 'dock', 'smiling', 'waving', 'arms', 'air', 'end', 'dock', 'overlooking', 'ocean', 'talking', 'how', 'would', 'love', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'bird', 'fly', 'air', 'swoop', 'down', 'caves', 'caverns', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'meet', 'lover', 'there', 'More', 'anything', 'just', 'talking', 'how', ""'d"", 'love', 'experience', 'love', 'freedom', 'fullest', 'Watch', 'carefully', 'speech', 'face', 'changes', 'excitement', 'happiness', 'saddest', 'most', 'longing', 'expression', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'actress', 'matter', 'seconds', 'sadly', 'God', 'wish', 'could', 'do', '..', 'perfect', 'only', 'Jodie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'such', 'finesse.Please', 'watch', 'movie', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Try', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'focus', 'main', 'relationship', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'remember', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'years', 'come']",N/A

William McNamara is the teenage Bill, who has the most touching scenes with Jodie Foster, who plays Katie, an important and meaningful relationship in his life.Watch Foster's face, especially when she faces away from others. She is brilliant in her portrayal, you will see the pain she suffers, even as a young girl.

You know you are in for something special from the first note of David Foster's rich, sensitive musical score, which is an integral part of the architecture of the film.  Jodie Foster is unforgetable as a free-thinking 50's teenager and, later, a  troubled woman who commits suicide. She leaves her ashes to life-long  friend Billy (Mark Harmon) and as he remembers her, an intricate series of  flashbacks take us to various stages of his life. Playing Billy as a  teenager, William McNamara is sweet, beautiful, and touching as the young  ballplayer who gives up a promising career. Billy must find a place for  Katie's ashes and, at the same time, his own reason for being. This is a  labor of love on the part of the writer/directors, and they hit it out of  the park.",5,home run,957916800,"05 10, 2000",2000,825,"['little', 'gem', 'near-perfect', 'start', 'finish', 'know', 'are', 'something', 'special', 'first', 'note', 'David', 'Foster', 'rich', 'sensitive', 'musical', 'score', 'integral', 'part', 'architecture', 'film', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'unforgetable', 'free-thinking', '50', 'teenager', 'later', 'troubled', 'woman', 'who', 'suicide', 'ashes', 'life-long', 'friend', 'Billy', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'intricate', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'take', 'various', 'stages', 'life', 'Playing', 'Billy', 'teenager', 'William', 'McNamara', 'sweet', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'young', 'ballplayer', 'who', 'up', 'promising', 'career', 'Billy', 'must', 'find', 'place', 'Katie', 'ashes', 'same', 'time', 'own', 'reason', 'being', 'labor', 'love', 'part', 'writer/directors', 'hit', 'park']",N/A

Yet I want to express some of my feelings after watching this movie once again, this time on DVD. 1. The DVD itself kind of let me down due to its lack of so many features I'd expected (commentaries, producer's notes, deleted scenes etc...) Hopefully Warner Bros. will release a special or collector's edition to make up for that. 2. I may be wrong, but ""Stealing Home"" obviously tends to become a ""classic"" -- in the sense that it brings up a lot of memories or nostalgic sentiments to the viewer, just like what ""Summer of '42"" or ""The Big Chill"" always does to me. That being said, I got myself a pleasant surprise while going over all the reviews on Amazon.com and found one written by Katie Kampmann -- who played ""baby Hope"" and whom the main character played by Jodie Foster was actually named after. If this wonderful movie grows with the ""real"" Katie, well, it also grows with many other people -- no doubt about it. And whenever we feel lost in life (""... when things get confusing, and believe me Billy, they will""), we can always go back to the treasure chest of our memories to find a mystical face or smile that'd give us the strength to move on in the right direction...",5,A pleasant surprise for me....,1023408000,"06 7, 2002",2002,1310,"['Nothing', 'much', 'add', 'most', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'how', 'Stealing', 'Home', 'came', 'touch', 'hearts', 'way', 'want', 'express', 'feelings', 'watching', 'movie', 'once', 'again', 'time', 'DVD', '1', 'DVD', 'kind', 'let', 'down', 'due', 'lack', 'so', 'many', 'features', ""'d"", 'expected', 'commentaries', 'producer', 'notes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'etc', 'Hopefully', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'will', 'release', 'special', 'collector', 'edition', 'make', 'up', '2', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'Stealing', 'Home', 'obviously', 'become', 'classic', 'sense', 'up', 'lot', 'memories', 'nostalgic', 'sentiments', 'viewer', 'just', 'what', 'Summer', ""'42"", 'Big', 'Chill', 'always', 'being', 'said', 'got', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'going', 'reviews', 'Amazon.com', 'found', 'one', 'written', 'Katie', 'Kampmann', 'who', 'played', 'baby', 'Hope', 'whom', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'was', 'actually', 'named', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'grows', 'real', 'Katie', 'well', 'also', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'doubt', 'feel', 'lost', 'life', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'confusing', 'believe', 'Billy', 'will', 'can', 'always', 'go', 'back', 'treasure', 'chest', 'memories', 'find', 'mystical', 'face', 'smile', ""'d"", 'give', 'strength', 'move', 'right', 'direction']",N/A
