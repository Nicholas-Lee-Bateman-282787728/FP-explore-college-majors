1387627,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0046BHC32,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","The Freebie has -what I believe- a ridiculous concept.  A couple wonders what it would be like to sleep with another person.  For the first 30 minutes, they sit in the car or in bed wondering whether sleeping with another person would be a healthy decision for their relationship (lol).  They wonder if flirting and having a one night stand would actually spice things up (lol).30 straight minutes of this doesn't exactly result in any kind of interesting storytelling, especially since all they do is lay around in bed and quietly talk about it- make sure you turn the volume up loud to hear it (that is, if such a silly concept is appealing enough that you actually end up watching this movie, which I hope it's not).After those dreaded 30 minutes pass by, they actually go through with it.  They find a partner for one night (the woman picks a bar and the man picks a woman he met at a restaurant) and then when the two get back together again, the question becomes ""Did they REALLY just have a one night stand?""  This portion of the film is tolerable which explains the 3-star rating I'm giving it.  The way they try to sort things out afterwards is appealing too.Dax Shepard portrays a character here almost identical to the one in the hit TV show Parenthood.  A guy who seems concerned about his girlfriend or wife, but does clueless things and ignores his better judgement.  This isn't really appealing to me, and he's the weak point of Parenthood.Overall, the storyline is really really exceptionally moronic and basic, but I suppose that's the point.",3,boring or interesting?

1387628,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0046BHC32,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","The Freebie is a lot of talking and not much action. The feeling I got from this film was, Woody Allen tried to make Hall Pass (Hall Pass), and failed miserably.The film opens beautifully, with a group of thirty something friends sitting around a dinner table talking. The banter is interesting, fun, and engaging. Annie and Darren appear to be a happy couple very much in love, entertaining their mostly single friends. The movie then moves on to Annie and Darren endlessly over analyzing everything. It becomes clear; these two people love each other deeply as intellectual friends that happen to share the same bed. About the a third of the way into this film, things really bogged down. The constant discussions about minutiae became annoying. By midway, I found myself thinking, will you just do it and stop talking about it?I apologize for bringing a brilliant director like Woody Allen together in the same sentence as Hall Pass. To me the fault in some of Allen's films is that he spends a long time intellectualizing simple events. I find myself frequently thinking, well Woody, would you just stop thinking and do it. The Hall Pass connection is that the guys get a ""freebie"" to do what they want with women for one week (actually a much more plausible scenario than this movie's one night). Although Hall Pass is an awful exploitation film, there is at least action, some humor, and some exciting scenes. The Freebie teases constantly, although it is rated R, there is no nudity; I found nothing terribly funny; and it feels more like a one room three act play than a film.This film does have a few good sides. This is Katie Asleton's directorial debut, and on the independent film scale, this is a film well worth supporting. She has a lot of potential if she had a better script and concentrated on directing only instead of acting in the lead role also. I really loved Katie Asleton in the role of Annie (homage to Annie Hall maybe?). She is gorgeous, shows wonderful emotional range, and I believed and cared for her character.I did not care for Dax Shepard as Darren. This role seemed to replay his role in the television series Parenthood (Parenthood: Season 1). The pseudo-intellectual, staring at the camera, asking too many questions, and trying to be a somewhat baked carefree guy was annoying to me.Although the film is only an hour and seventeen minutes, it is still about ten minutes too long. The film is rated R for language and sexuality. I don't really remember very many f-bombs or any nudity. I have a hard time imagining why this film isn't PG-13, aside from the topic of infidelity. On the other hand, not many younger viewers would sit through much more than fifteen minutes of this film anyway. This would have been far more interesting if The Freebie was a more adult film.I didn't hate this film. I wish there had been a lot less talking and a lot more doing.",2,Nice Try,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,2895,"['Freebie', 'lot', 'talking', 'not', 'much', 'action', 'feeling', 'got', 'film', 'was', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'tried', 'make', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'failed', 'miserably.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'group', 'thirty', 'something', 'friends', 'sitting', 'dinner', 'table', 'talking', 'banter', 'interesting', 'fun', 'engaging', 'Annie', 'Darren', 'appear', 'be', 'happy', 'couple', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'entertaining', 'mostly', 'single', 'friends', 'movie', 'then', 'Annie', 'Darren', 'endlessly', 'analyzing', 'everything', 'clear', 'two', 'people', 'love', 'other', 'deeply', 'intellectual', 'friends', 'happen', 'share', 'same', 'bed', 'third', 'way', 'film', 'things', 'really', 'bogged', 'down', 'constant', 'discussions', 'minutiae', 'became', 'annoying', 'midway', 'found', 'thinking', 'will', 'just', 'do', 'stop', 'talking', 'apologize', 'bringing', 'brilliant', 'director', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'together', 'same', 'sentence', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'fault', 'Allen', 'films', 'long', 'time', 'intellectualizing', 'simple', 'events', 'find', 'frequently', 'thinking', 'well', 'Woody', 'would', 'just', 'stop', 'thinking', 'do', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'connection', 'guys', 'get', 'freebie', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'women', 'one', 'week', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'plausible', 'scenario', 'movie', 'one', 'night', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'awful', 'exploitation', 'film', 'least', 'action', 'humor', 'exciting', 'scenes', 'Freebie', 'constantly', 'rated', 'R', 'nudity', 'found', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'funny', 'more', 'one', 'room', 'three', 'act', 'play', 'film.This', 'film', 'have', 'few', 'good', 'sides', 'Katie', 'Asleton', 'directorial', 'debut', 'independent', 'film', 'scale', 'film', 'well', 'supporting', 'lot', 'potential', 'had', 'better', 'script', 'concentrated', 'directing', 'only', 'instead', 'acting', 'lead', 'role', 'also', 'really', 'loved', 'Katie', 'Asleton', 'role', 'Annie', 'homage', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'maybe', 'gorgeous', 'wonderful', 'emotional', 'range', 'believed', 'cared', 'character.I', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'Dax', 'Shepard', 'Darren', 'role', 'seemed', 'replay', 'role', 'television', 'series', 'Parenthood', 'Parenthood', 'Season', '1', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'staring', 'camera', 'asking', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'trying', 'be', 'somewhat', 'baked', 'carefree', 'guy', 'was', 'annoying', 'me.Although', 'film', 'only', 'hour', 'seventeen', 'minutes', 'still', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'language', 'sexuality', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'very', 'many', 'f-bombs', 'nudity', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'imagining', 'why', 'film', ""n't"", 'PG-13', 'aside', 'topic', 'infidelity', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'many', 'younger', 'viewers', 'would', 'sit', 'much', 'more', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'anyway', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'Freebie', 'was', 'more', 'adult', 'film.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'film', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'lot', 'less', 'talking', 'lot', 'more', 'doing']",N/A

1387631,A5SC9O8TZJ6DK,B0046BHC32,Gregory William Locke,"[7, 9]","I'll start with the one bone I need to pick: the title of the movie, The Freebie. The name implies that the film is fun and lighthearted. Sure, at times. But, as a whole, this is a serious story that will surely be relatable to a whole lot of people. And, while I'm on the topic, I get the impression that a lot of people were misled by both the poster (which makes it look like an Jud Apatow movie) and the casting of Dax Shepard, who is mostly known for his comedic roles. Thus, I'd guess, the low score the movie has on IMDb. The unreasonably low score.So, I'm guessing, someone along the way knew that this was a pretty great movie and thus wanted it to be one that people would see. Thus the title. Thus the poster. Thus all the wrong people seeing this movie. The Freebie is for fans of Noah Baumbach and Joe Swanberg.What The Freebie is is naturalistic drama done right. The story is simple: a happy couple decide to ""fix"" their bedroom apathy by taking a single night to go out and share some bone with a stranger. Both Katie Aselton and Shepard are fantastic, both as lovers and as people going through a mighty big challenge together. Much of the dialogue in the first two acts plays through in a way that makes you wish it was your relationship - the two leads seeming so uniquely happy together at times that you get the feeling that Aselton took from her personal life for the script. Things change a bit in the third act, as they should. Things get, well, heavy.Knowing that the writer/director, Aselton, is married to actor/writer/director Mark Duplass, I half expected the film to have a Mumblecore vibe. Not really the case. The cinematography is solid, if simple, the picture always looking big and bright and, at times, quite stylized. And sure, the writing and acting are great, but it's the combination of clever editing and the believable bond between the two leads that really make this thing work.I don't want to give too much away. Go watch the movie ... it's streaming right now on Netflix and up for rent at your local video store. I'll be excited to see what Katie does next. I could see the coupling of this project and her role on ""The League"" getting her some rom-com roles alongside Paul Rudd or Seth Rogan or whoever. I hope she passes on those. I love to see a smart, talented female ""make it"" in any male-dominated industry. I think Katie has what it takes to have a solid career as a filmmaker, The Freebie standing as a very promising directorial debut.",4,An Amazing Debut from Kate Aselton!,1300147200,"03 15, 2011",2011,2490,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'one', 'bone', 'need', 'pick', 'title', 'movie', 'Freebie', 'name', 'film', 'fun', 'lighthearted', 'Sure', 'times', 'whole', 'serious', 'story', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'relatable', 'whole', 'lot', 'people', ""'m"", 'topic', 'get', 'impression', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'misled', 'poster', 'look', 'Jud', 'Apatow', 'movie', 'casting', 'Dax', 'Shepard', 'who', 'mostly', 'known', 'comedic', 'roles', 'Thus', ""'d"", 'guess', 'low', 'score', 'movie', 'IMDb', 'unreasonably', 'low', 'score.So', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'someone', 'way', 'knew', 'was', 'pretty', 'great', 'movie', 'thus', 'wanted', 'be', 'one', 'people', 'would', 'see', 'Thus', 'title', 'Thus', 'poster', 'Thus', 'wrong', 'people', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Freebie', 'fans', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'Joe', 'Swanberg.What', 'Freebie', 'naturalistic', 'drama', 'done', 'right', 'story', 'simple', 'happy', 'couple', 'decide', 'fix', 'bedroom', 'apathy', 'taking', 'single', 'night', 'go', 'out', 'share', 'bone', 'stranger', 'Katie', 'Aselton', 'Shepard', 'are', 'fantastic', 'lovers', 'people', 'going', 'mighty', 'big', 'challenge', 'together', 'Much', 'dialogue', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'way', 'wish', 'was', 'relationship', 'two', 'leads', 'seeming', 'so', 'uniquely', 'happy', 'together', 'times', 'get', 'feeling', 'Aselton', 'took', 'personal', 'life', 'script', 'Things', 'change', 'bit', 'third', 'act', 'should', 'Things', 'get', 'well', 'heavy.Knowing', 'writer/director', 'Aselton', 'married', 'actor/writer/director', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'half', 'expected', 'film', 'have', 'Mumblecore', 'vibe', 'Not', 'really', 'case', 'cinematography', 'solid', 'simple', 'picture', 'always', 'looking', 'big', 'bright', 'times', 'quite', 'stylized', 'sure', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'great', 'combination', 'clever', 'editing', 'believable', 'bond', 'two', 'leads', 'really', 'make', 'thing', 'work.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Go', 'watch', 'movie', 'streaming', 'right', 'now', 'Netflix', 'up', 'rent', 'local', 'video', 'store', ""'ll"", 'be', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'Katie', 'next', 'could', 'see', 'coupling', 'project', 'role', 'League', 'getting', 'rom-com', 'roles', 'alongside', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'whoever', 'hope', 'love', 'see', 'smart', 'talented', 'female', 'make', 'male-dominated', 'industry', 'think', 'Katie', 'what', 'have', 'solid', 'career', 'filmmaker', 'Freebie', 'standing', 'very', 'promising', 'directorial', 'debut']",N/A
