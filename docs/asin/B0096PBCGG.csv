Soldiers living on an alien infested planet must battle those who have become self-aware and seek to destroy all of humanity.I've written about this before in many other low-budget film reviews but I honestly think that the general populace is so spoiled on big budget affairs anymore that they don't give low-budget films a chance. If you're like me and you dig watching low-budget films; you'll notice that, practically, every one has a long list of haters reviewing it stating how bad that it is.Android Insurrection is one of those sci-fi films you'll either like, love, or hate but, regardless, you probably won't change your mind about it. As for my opinion on it, well- much like Alien Dawn, AI is entertaining for the 83 minutes that it lasts. It's acting and plot were okay. Special effects were good. Also like Alien Dawn, it feels uninspired and generic at times(which is my only gripe). Course, it is a good waste of 83 minutes. I've seen far worse films in my day. It reminded me of a cross between War of the Worlds & I, Robot but not quite.At any rate, it's probably another film that I'd only watch once and not give it another look. Even so, though, it is still worth a look if you're a sci-fi fan.",3,Android Insurrection........,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,1323,"['23rd', 'century', 'advancements', 'science', 'have', 'led', 'creation', 'indestructible', 'killing', 'machine', 'Soldiers', 'living', 'alien', 'infested', 'planet', 'must', 'battle', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'self-aware', 'seek', 'destroy', 'humanity.I', ""'ve"", 'written', 'many', 'other', 'low-budget', 'film', 'reviews', 'honestly', 'think', 'general', 'populace', 'so', 'spoiled', 'big', 'budget', 'affairs', 'anymore', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'low-budget', 'films', 'chance', ""'re"", 'dig', 'watching', 'low-budget', 'films', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'practically', 'one', 'long', 'list', 'haters', 'reviewing', 'stating', 'how', 'bad', 'is.Android', 'Insurrection', 'one', 'sci-fi', 'films', ""'ll"", 'like', 'love', 'hate', 'regardless', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'mind', 'opinion', 'well-', 'much', 'Alien', 'Dawn', 'AI', 'entertaining', '83', 'minutes', 'acting', 'plot', 'were', 'okay', 'Special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'Also', 'Alien', 'Dawn', 'uninspired', 'generic', 'times', 'only', 'gripe', 'Course', 'good', 'waste', '83', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'worse', 'films', 'day', 'reminded', 'cross', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Robot', 'not', 'quite.At', 'rate', 'probably', 'film', ""'d"", 'only', 'watch', 'once', 'not', 'give', 'look', 'Even', 'so', 'still', 'worth', 'look', ""'re"", 'sci-fi', 'fan']",Android Insurrection

I am glad it cost me nothing but my time, ok that was over priced but I think to comment on other reviews about this product would be the best review of this product. Comment on nudity in the film was made, I do not believe it was clarified but what I saw I believe was the logo for Pandora Machine Films Production; sorry, it was the best part of this movie. You know how some movies are so bad they are entertaining, maybe funny or thought provoking. Not this one. You know how some movies are just bad and you feel you might be able to forgive them, not this one. They do as in one reviewers keen observation use the F word a bit more than probably needed, but then they needed the R rating. Now for some positive words on the release. It (the dvd) does come in a sturdy case. The artwork on the outside of the case is nice. It does appear to be a quality disk, just the disk, although the disk is not a rewritable so you are stuck with the Pandora Machine Films into scene of the nude in antique black and white as the only good part of the film. Believe the reviews on this page, if you are reading this before buying, you probably don't want to do that. If you do buy, let me know what you think by using the comment on this review button. I was about to list a couple films I felt this one was trying to copy, but honestly I feel it would be an injustice to the other films to have their names in the same review.

1586289,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0096PBCGG,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[4, 4]","I am not sure where to start. This is a very bad film, but has some camp value. The film takes place in the year 2532. We know robots have taken over all of our tasks, but we don't know anything about society or why there is a desert between Philadelphia and New York, why it is called the Philadelphia Desert, or why the young Prince of England is there being held captive by a robot. Afterwards, a group of humans take on the task of rescuing an android and whatever humans they can find from a rogue AI manufacturing facility which looks like a large 20th century metal frame warehouse complete with office cubicles and marks-a-lot eraser boards.The crew takes their orders from a man (David Ian Lee) with a varying bad German accent, Elvis chops and a Hitler mustache. The android they rescue (Sarah-Doe Osborne) is one of those jerk your head around androids. The special effects were made worse once it got to the editors where they ensured the sounds of gun fire and the CG gun flames hopelessly don't match. There is a ""Star Wars"" type light laser. Sometimes it uses a blue CG light, but in battle the laser looks like it is plastic pea green.  There were a lot of pauses as if the actors forgot their lines. Oh yes. The film has a twist, but at that point, who cares? Virginia Logan is the main actor in this one. She runs around showing off her bare midriff. Her name is Foxwell, perhaps to make us think about a low budget ""Transformers"" Megan Fox. She tried to carry the film, but it was just too much of a stinker.The film is worse than a SyFy production or Asylum. The beginning has a long narration about robots and likewise the ending has an extremely long boring narration followed by the movie credits...Seriously, who does that? 8th graders?The DVD cover says ""brief nudity"" which is kind of odd, because the film itself has no nudity. It does have B&W; nudity at the very beginning to present the film logo, but none in the main body of the film.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex. Aforesaid nudity. $9.96 Walmart. They took me.
