Sylvie invites her to ride home, she also invites Ivy into her house. She was making a deadly mistake.Anyone can tell that something is definitely odd about Ivy, but she is charming to anyone around her. Sylvie's sick mother is always depressed, but when Ivy comes along, Sylvie's mother starts to love Ivy. Sylvie's dad is really starting to get closer to Ivy, too. But Sylvie herself starts to regret the day that she talked to Ivy, because Ivy is starting to ruin her life. But Ivy wants to stay in Sylvie's house, and whatever Ivy wants, Ivy gets.This movie was really entertaining throughout the whole thing, and it always kept you wondering what horrible thing that the misuderstood Ivy was going to do next.

35749,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780627776,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","In all honesty `Poison Ivy' is a terrible movie.  The plot is predictable and campy, the script is poorly written and the mood of the film is manipulated and cheesy.  That said; it is campy fun.  `Wild Things' proved that camp can be done to perfection, and while this is no `Wild Things' it is certainly no `Showgirls'.  What separates `Poison Ivy' from becoming the diluted mess that `Showgirls' was is the acting (although Gina Gershon was fantastic; seriously), which actually saves this film from being nothing more than a poorly conceived skin flick with `Lifetime' movie direction.Ivy is a seductive teen who befriends Sylvie, an introverted girl whose mother is very sick and whose father is obviously suffering as much as his wife.  Ivy moves in with this family and soon begins spinning her web and spreading her vine into the crevices of her new life.  This involves seducing Sylvie's father Darryl and trying to take the place of her mother Georgie.  As the film spirals to a close it runs off course in a series of far fetched sequences that expose Ivy for the person she is and brings a seemingly justified conclusion.  If it weren't for the fact that Barrymore sells Ivy so well I'd be forced to say that this movie really has no value whatsoever.But I can't honestly say that...Drew Barrymore is a very fine actress, one that is often underrated and seen as mere eye-candy or Hollywood royalty (because of her family) instead of as a viable screen actress.  Her performance here should squash that.  I was having a conversation with a friend about the fact that a good actress will rise above a bad script and make it work.  Barrymore does that flawlessly here.  This script is undeniably bad (and the dialog is even worse) but Barrymore never shows it.  She jumps into her role as if it was a role from the heavens and delivers a very strong and very convincing portrait of a very misunderstood girl.  The ambiguities she brings to her character help make the film slightly better than it would have been otherwise (and I say `slightly' because even Barrymore can't save the film from absurdity).The remaining actors all do well also.  Sara Gilbert is decent here, but she pales when standing next to Barrymore.  She has the disadvantage of being the most normal character in the film so she ends up becoming far less interesting.  Ivy, Darryl and even Georgie all have their issues to contend with and thus become the focal point of our attention.  Sylvie is merely trying to survive inside their world and thus she becomes rather dull.  Tom Skerritt does a fine job shoveling his ridiculous dialog as does Cheryl Ladd, who really has a thankless role but never lets us know her disappointment.Barrymore is the sole reason to watch this movie though.  She gives a great performance that shows her acting talent full throttle.  Looking the part and acting the part are two totally different things (as is made very clear when considering Elizabeth Berkley's horrendous performance in `Showgirls' versus Barrymore's stunning portrayal here).  So, while I can't say that this is a good movie (because it's not) I have to admit that it has its moments, and it has Barrymore; and on a rainy, lazy afternoon that is more than enough for me.",2,The movie as a whole is poison; but Barrymore is utter perfection...,1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,3252,"['honesty', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'terrible', 'movie', 'plot', 'predictable', 'campy', 'script', 'poorly', 'written', 'mood', 'film', 'manipulated', 'cheesy', 'said', 'campy', 'fun', 'Wild', 'Things', 'proved', 'camp', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'perfection', 'Wild', 'Things', 'certainly', 'Showgirls', 'What', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'becoming', 'diluted', 'mess', 'Showgirls', 'was', 'acting', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'was', 'fantastic', 'seriously', 'actually', 'film', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'skin', 'flick', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'direction.Ivy', 'seductive', 'teen', 'who', 'Sylvie', 'introverted', 'girl', 'mother', 'very', 'sick', 'father', 'obviously', 'suffering', 'as', 'much', 'wife', 'Ivy', 'family', 'soon', 'begins', 'spinning', 'web', 'spreading', 'vine', 'crevices', 'new', 'life', 'seducing', 'Sylvie', 'father', 'Darryl', 'trying', 'take', 'place', 'mother', 'Georgie', 'film', 'spirals', 'close', 'off', 'course', 'series', 'far', 'fetched', 'sequences', 'expose', 'Ivy', 'person', 'seemingly', 'justified', 'conclusion', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Barrymore', 'Ivy', 'so', 'well', ""'d"", 'be', 'forced', 'say', 'movie', 'really', 'value', 'whatsoever.But', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'say', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'very', 'fine', 'actress', 'one', 'often', 'underrated', 'seen', 'mere', 'eye-candy', 'Hollywood', 'royalty', 'family', 'instead', 'viable', 'screen', 'actress', 'performance', 'here', 'should', 'squash', 'was', 'having', 'conversation', 'friend', 'fact', 'good', 'actress', 'will', 'rise', 'bad', 'script', 'make', 'work', 'Barrymore', 'flawlessly', 'here', 'script', 'undeniably', 'bad', 'dialog', 'even', 'worse', 'Barrymore', 'never', 'role', 'was', 'role', 'heavens', 'delivers', 'very', 'strong', 'very', 'convincing', 'portrait', 'very', 'misunderstood', 'girl', 'ambiguities', 'character', 'help', 'make', 'film', 'slightly', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'otherwise', 'say', 'slightly', 'even', 'Barrymore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'absurdity', 'remaining', 'actors', 'do', 'well', 'also', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'decent', 'here', 'when', 'standing', 'next', 'Barrymore', 'disadvantage', 'being', 'most', 'normal', 'character', 'film', 'up', 'becoming', 'far', 'less', 'interesting', 'Ivy', 'Darryl', 'even', 'Georgie', 'have', 'issues', 'contend', 'thus', 'become', 'focal', 'point', 'attention', 'Sylvie', 'merely', 'trying', 'survive', 'world', 'thus', 'rather', 'dull', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'fine', 'job', 'shoveling', 'ridiculous', 'dialog', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'who', 'really', 'thankless', 'role', 'never', 'know', 'disappointment.Barrymore', 'sole', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'great', 'performance', 'acting', 'talent', 'full', 'throttle', 'Looking', 'part', 'acting', 'part', 'are', 'two', 'totally', 'different', 'things', 'made', 'very', 'clear', 'when', 'considering', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkley', 'horrendous', 'performance', 'Showgirls', 'versus', 'Barrymore', 'stunning', 'portrayal', 'here', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'admit', 'moments', 'Barrymore', 'rainy', 'lazy', 'afternoon', 'more', 'enough']",N/A

35753,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0780627776,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 5]","This is primarily a vehicle to exploit the generalized sensuality of Miss Drew Barrymore, an excellent actress and heir of a great acting family.  Drew, who was so cuddily in E.T. when she was six years old or so, is now oh so cuddily and then some to a more varied audience.  Here, as a scheming little poor girl, she seduces dad, mom and daughter (in psychologically different ways) before slipping into murder.  She is sexy, trashy and very pretty.Sara Gilbert (from TV's ""Rosanne"") plays the dweeby poor little rich girl daughter with veracity and some wit.  Tom Skerrit is the father without a clue; and Cheryl Ladd, looking rather fetching despite the role, is the dreary mother.  Yes, old TV stars can find work!  Best scene is when Sara and Drew go to the tattoo parlor.  Drew makes a few ugly remarks causing Sara to get up to leave, but Drew draws her back tenderly (to pay the tab), pulls her close, and kisses her.  When the beer-bellied tattoo guy tries to join in, the girls give him an ""ugh!"" and split.The slow-motion seduction of Skerrit seems a little drawn out.  Even after Drew kisses and licks his cut hand, Skerrit just looks off into space in befuddlement.  Later things heat up though, and then take a kinky turn when Mom, through a drug and alcohol haze, dimly notices Drew wearing her sexy dress and doing some love numbers on her husband.Second best scene is after the funeral with Drew sleeping in Cheryl Ladd's bed where she is discovered by Sara.  Drew urges her friend, the distraught daughter, to join her.  ""Pretend I'm your mother,"" Drew says.  As they lie in bed, Sara confides to Drew that what she couldn't say to her mother was ""I love you.""  Drew kisses her head and holds her close.What was intended here was a psychological study of a teenaged girl without much of a home or much of a family who is drawn to adopt her own family among those of her friends, and in doing so assumes the role of the mother in toto.

Although it will never be the exact score from the film we can always play the movie.Here are some recommendations of sexy movie music to check out:Theme From Body HeatSadness Part 1- By Enigma (Boxing Helena, Single White Female)Wasted Time- By My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult (Showgirls)I'm Your Man- By Leonard Cohen (Secretary)Money Can't Buy It- Annie Lennox (Striptease)Carly's Song- By Enigma (Sliver)Never, never Gonna Give You Up- and every song By Barry White(Bruce Almighty)Orane- By Les Negresses Vertes- (Bad Influence)Taste- By Auto & Cherokee- (The Crush)Life In Mono- By Mono (Great Expectations)Theme From Taxi Driverand more!",5,I keep watching it even years later,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,1130,"['movie', 'could', 'never', 'hold', 'candle', 'teen', 'thriller', 'today', 'magic', 'could', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'recaptured', 'time', 'watch', 'am', 'more', 'more', 'mesmorized', ""'m"", 'not', 'gay', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'hot', 'movie', 'music', 'amazing', 'very', 'sexy', 'too', 'bad', 'never', 'put', 'out', 'soundtrack', 'composer', 'David', 'Michael', 'Frank', 'checked', 'out', 'other', 'music', 'scores', 'are', 'sound', 'similar', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'exact', 'score', 'film', 'can', 'always', 'play', 'movie.Here', 'are', 'recommendations', 'sexy', 'movie', 'music', 'check', 'out', 'Theme', 'Body', 'HeatSadness', 'Part', '1-', 'Enigma', 'Boxing', 'Helena', 'Single', 'White', 'Female', 'Wasted', 'Time-', 'My', 'Life', 'Thrill', 'Kill', 'Kult', 'Showgirls', ""'m"", 'Your', 'Man-', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'Secretary', 'Money', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'It-', 'Annie', 'Lennox', 'Striptease', 'Carly', 'Song-', 'Enigma', 'Sliver', 'Never', 'never', 'Gon', 'Give', 'Up-', 'song', 'Barry', 'White', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'Orane-', 'Les', 'Negresses', 'Vertes-', 'Bad', 'Influence', 'Taste-', 'Auto', 'Cherokee-', 'Crush', 'Life', 'Mono-', 'Mono', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'Theme', 'Taxi', 'Driverand', 'more']",N/A
35758,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0780627776,Gregor von Kallahann,"[2, 3]","Erotic thriller?  Or erotic melodrama?  Drew Barrymore inhabits her role as the teenage homewreaker who worms her way into the affections of all the members of a wealthy, but dysfunctional California family.  She's riveting.  But the script and the direction pretty much let her--and the rest of the talented cast-down.As a psychological drama, the movie works pretty well for the first hour or so.  The bond between two misfit schoolmates (Barrymore and ROSEANNE'S Sara Gilbert) rings true--and its erotic undercurrent is not totally glossed over for once.  The flirtation between the teen tart and the repressed and tormented pater familias (Tom Skerritt) is a little more paint-by-numbers, but the actors are so good, they pull it off.What is less convincing is how quickly the interloper Ivy wins over her friend's initially skeptical, ailing mother (Cheryl Ladd).  Ladd's character Georgie is sweet talked out of her suspicions one too many times to be believed.  Are we supposed to believe that her illness has left her numb and dumb?  This still elegant, sophisticated woman?  It's asking too much.(SPOILER WARNING)The plot derails so quickly after Mom's sudden death.  The most ridiculous moment is the one that leads to Ivy's kinda sorta ""confession.""  Ivy has already been in several situations where she's had to come up with a quick excuse, and she always pulls it off.  When it comes to explaining knowing the tune that was playing in Georgie's room before she apparently leapt to her death--well, there are any number of possible explanations, including the fact that Ivy had taken to sleeping in Georgie's room after the latter's death.  A veteran conniver like Ivy should have been able to hand her friend a convincing enough line even in the heat of a very stressful moment.The biggest problem with a film like POISON IVY is that it hints that it's going to reveal the dark corners of the human heart in a knowing way.  But it doesn't.  Yeah, it exposes the moralistic father's hypocrisy, but only hints at his complexity.  In fact, nearly all the characters could have been better developed.  There's a hint that the mom isn't really as sick as she seems; or rather, that her illness may have a strong psychosomatic component.  Only the two girls are presented in any depth, but even that is obscured when the plot turns to lurid melodrama in the last third.",3,Trash With Flash,1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,2376,"['Erotic', 'thriller', 'erotic', 'melodrama', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'role', 'teenage', 'homewreaker', 'who', 'way', 'affections', 'members', 'wealthy', 'dysfunctional', 'California', 'family', 'riveting', 'script', 'direction', 'pretty', 'much', 'let', 'rest', 'talented', 'cast-down.As', 'psychological', 'drama', 'movie', 'pretty', 'well', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'bond', 'two', 'misfit', 'schoolmates', 'Barrymore', 'ROSEANNE', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'true', 'erotic', 'undercurrent', 'not', 'totally', 'glossed', 'over', 'once', 'flirtation', 'teen', 'tart', 'repressed', 'tormented', 'pater', 'familias', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'little', 'more', 'paint-by-numbers', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'pull', 'off.What', 'less', 'convincing', 'how', 'quickly', 'interloper', 'Ivy', 'friend', 'initially', 'skeptical', 'ailing', 'mother', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'Ladd', 'character', 'Georgie', 'sweet', 'talked', 'suspicions', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'be', 'believed', 'Are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'illness', 'left', 'numb', 'dumb', 'still', 'elegant', 'sophisticated', 'woman', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'SPOILER', 'WARNING', 'plot', 'derails', 'so', 'quickly', 'Mom', 'sudden', 'death', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'moment', 'one', 'Ivy', 'kinda', 'sorta', 'confession', 'Ivy', 'already', 'been', 'several', 'situations', 'where', 'had', 'come', 'up', 'quick', 'excuse', 'always', 'off', 'When', 'explaining', 'knowing', 'tune', 'was', 'playing', 'Georgie', 'room', 'apparently', 'leapt', 'death', 'well', 'are', 'number', 'possible', 'explanations', 'including', 'fact', 'Ivy', 'had', 'taken', 'sleeping', 'Georgie', 'room', 'latter', 'death', 'veteran', 'conniver', 'Ivy', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'hand', 'friend', 'convincing', 'enough', 'line', 'even', 'heat', 'very', 'stressful', 'moment.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'POISON', 'IVY', 'going', 'reveal', 'dark', 'corners', 'human', 'heart', 'knowing', 'way', ""n't"", 'Yeah', 'moralistic', 'father', 'hypocrisy', 'only', 'hints', 'complexity', 'fact', 'nearly', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'developed', 'hint', 'mom', ""n't"", 'really', 'as', 'sick', 'rather', 'illness', 'may', 'have', 'strong', 'psychosomatic', 'component', 'Only', 'two', 'girls', 'are', 'presented', 'depth', 'even', 'obscured', 'when', 'plot', 'lurid', 'melodrama', 'last', 'third']",N/A

She befriends Sylvie (Sara Gilbert).  Sylvie is shy, geeky, and doesn't have many friends, so she is happy that Ivy is showing her some attention.  Sylvie invites Ivy over to her house.  There, she meets Sylvie's parents, Daryl Cooper (Tom Skerritt) and his wife Georgie Cooper (Cheryl Ladd).  Daryl is the manager of the local television station, while Georgie is suffering from emphysema.  Georgie rarely comes out of her room and often thinks of suicide by jumping from the bedroom ledge.  Georgie's mood seems to improve after meeting Ivy, and soon, Ivy is spending most of her time at the Cooper's home.However, something strange is beginning to occur.  Ivy has begun to take an interest in Daryl.  Ivy volunteers to work at a party hosted by Daryl, and she dresses in one of Georgie's favorite dresses. While suffering from a drinking relapse, Daryl puts the moves on Ivy, and they begin to make out.  These sessions between Daryl and Ivy become more frequent.Ivy continues living in the Cooper home until one day, Ivy spots Georgie standing on the bedroom ledge.  She puts her hand on Georgie's shoulder as if to comfort her, but instead, Ivy pushes her.  Georgie falls to her death.  The death is ruled a suicide, because everyone was aware that Georgie had contimplated killing herself before.  Ivy goes on as if nothing ever happened.Sylvie decides to shine up her mother's red Corvette convertible, hoping it will make her feel better and ease her pain of not being able to tell her mother her true feelings before she died.  Ivy shows up carrying the urn containing Georgie's ashes and suggest that the ""three"" of them take a drive in the Corvette.  While driving, Ivy begins humming a song.  Sylvie recognizes the song as the one that her mother was listening to the morning she died.  She accuses Ivy of killing her mother.  The two are then involved in an accident.  Ivy makes it look like Sylvie was driving, and she leaves Sylvie in the driver's seat.  Sylvie is put in the hospital, while Ivy resumes her affair with Daryl.  Convinced she's right about Ivy, Sylvie sneaks out of the hospital and hitches a ride back to her house.  There, she catches Ivy and her father in the act.  What will happen next?  Will Ivy suffer the same fate as Georgie, or will Ivy get her wish and they all will become a family?This is a very good movie.  The plot is well-conceived, and the twists will keep you guessing throughout the movie.

I originally bought the sequel - with Alyssa Milano, cos I'm having serious withdrawal symptoms from Charmed - and since it seems to be stupid to have the sequel without the original, I bought the original.Set in somewhere extremely rainy (it rains pretty much every other scene), Sylvie meets a girl who she calls Ivy, because of the tattoo transfer of a cross with ivy at the bottom. (Do we ever find out her real name? Cos all 'Ivy' says when Sylvie says that's her name, is: ""It gives me a chance to start over."" And she later gets the tattoo for real and he charged her $40??? I wish my tattoos were that cheap!) They quickly become best friends, and Ivy tries to fit into her friend's family pretty much by seducing the father and killing the mother. Some friend huh?This should have been one of those movies that is all nude scene after nude scene after nude scene. With any other actress I think it probably would have been. But with Drew Barrymore at the helm, it became something more than that, almost touching at times. There are some weird moments, like why the parents never question why Ivy is always there; her mother lending Ivy her clothes and the father leering from afar.Drew Barrymore, and the majorly big haired Sara Gilbert were the shining stars in this movie. Funnily enough they later starred in Riding In Cars With Boys together, where I didn't even realise it was the same girl in that as it was in Poison Ivy.Also look out for Leonardo Di Caprio in this - a blink and you'll miss him scene.

Not trying to be rude, but what the hell is wrong with that girls chin? It grew over the years, because she looked fine in bad girls this movie, and i think boys on the side, but movies like never been kissed, and at the end of charlie's angels full throttle, all you can see when you look at her face is that huge white chin, like a jay leno chin. reminds me of the moon man from mcdonalds... with the huge chin that sticks way out. it's a cruel fact of what time does to our looks, when you get older you arent as pretty as you use to be, but i never thought chins grew bigger, in her early years her chin was of normal size now it looks huge and deformed. AS for this movie, not sexy at all, unless you find a backstabbing, murdering, lying, crazy ass teenage girl ..... sexy? Maybe men would like it, because all it has is sex scenes. only for shallow people who get excited when it comes to ""that fantasy"" of a much older man having sex with a teenage girl, and he's old enough to be her father.

Although alot of people  might not enjoy this film, with all the sex and the content of the film,  but it is interesting to watch to see just what lengths Drew Barrymore will  go to. In this film Drew Barrymore gets taken in by her new best friend,  and then things go awire. Her sexual manners seduces the father, and while  she is getting to the father, she is moving on the wife as her daughter who  understands her life-threatening condition. Her friend doesn't trust Ivy  after awhile, so Drew Barrymore(ivy) decides to take matters into her own  hands in a tense and manner of seeking revenge to move into the family to  become loved by all. This movie may not appeal to alot of people, but it  was very good in my mind, because Drew Barrymore is my fav. actress since I  was seven.

35777,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0780627776,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","...that's the basic plot of 1992's ""Poison Ivy"" starring Drew Barrymore in the titular role. The movie comes from a long tradition of films about a hot little babysitter (or nanny or friend) taking control of the family by winning the hearts of the kids and seducing the husband. ""The Babysitter"" (1980) and ""Summer Girl"" (1983) are two examples, both TV films (available on youtube). In ""Poison Ivy"" Drew, as Ivy, plays a friend of the awkward misfit Sylvie (Sara Gilbert). Tom Skerritt plays the slowly-seduced husband and Cheryl Ladd the withering (but still beautiful) mother.""Poison Ivy"" is more stylized than the aforementioned examples and technically better due to a much bigger budget. One of its best highlights is its score, which is equal parts haunting, romantic, melancholic and beautiful. Speaking of melancholic, there's an element of sadness to the story because the family is so wealthy -- living on a mansion on a hill in Los Angeles (shot on location) -- but they're so spiritually bereft. It just goes to show that all the financial success and material possessions in the world can't buy happiness and love.Drew was almost 17 during filming and plays the sultry little tamale well, which brings up why people tend to look down on the film -- it's nothing more than a lethal Lolita tale with a slick garnishment and they write it off as trash exploitation. Regardless, it works for what it is; and, after all, does every film have to be ""Ghandi""? Besides, ""Poison Ivy"" and similar films are more than just ""trash exploitation"". They're commentaries on the power of a woman or, more specifically, the power of a young beautiful woman. In the story, Ivy comes from a troubled past but, as a blossoming woman, she realizes the power she wields and seems to bask in it.I was involved with a church for a number of years and the granddaughter of the pastor was aged 17-22 at the time. She wasn't in Drew's league, as far as beauty goes -- not even close -- yet she still had power. She would lie about people and spread rumors and, because she was the pastor's granddaughter, some morons would believe her. She started dating a naive relative of mine, who was 19 years her senior, and it was clear that she was just interested in his money. At some point she was able to get his credit card info and bought over $17,000 worth of merchandise without him knowing it until it was too late. She did everything in her power to move into his house, but his aging mother blocked the last attempt at the last minute. His mom said that she could just see the vixen pushing her down the stairs, or something something like this, to get her out of the picture. It was discovered that the little tart tried to buy life insurance on the guy, which was very odd. You can draw your own conclusions.My point is that these lethal Lolitas exist -- young vixens who use their beauty to cause havoc, ruin lives and take control. Trash exploitation or not, it's good fodder for a movie, particularly if it's done stylishly, like ""Poison Ivy"".The film runs 88 minutes and the unrated version 93 minutes, both available on the DVD.GRADE: B+",4,A luscious Lolita takes over the family...,1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,3133,"['basic', 'plot', '1992', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'starring', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'titular', 'role', 'movie', 'long', 'tradition', 'films', 'hot', 'little', 'babysitter', 'nanny', 'friend', 'taking', 'control', 'family', 'winning', 'hearts', 'kids', 'seducing', 'husband', 'Babysitter', '1980', 'Summer', 'Girl', '1983', 'are', 'two', 'examples', 'TV', 'films', 'available', 'youtube', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'Drew', 'Ivy', 'friend', 'awkward', 'misfit', 'Sylvie', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'slowly-seduced', 'husband', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'withering', 'still', 'beautiful', 'mother', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'more', 'stylized', 'aforementioned', 'examples', 'technically', 'better', 'due', 'much', 'bigger', 'budget', 'One', 'best', 'highlights', 'score', 'equal', 'parts', 'haunting', 'romantic', 'melancholic', 'beautiful', 'Speaking', 'melancholic', 'element', 'sadness', 'story', 'family', 'so', 'wealthy', 'living', 'mansion', 'hill', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'shot', 'location', ""'re"", 'so', 'spiritually', 'bereft', 'just', 'show', 'financial', 'success', 'material', 'possessions', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'happiness', 'love.Drew', 'was', 'almost', '17', 'filming', 'sultry', 'little', 'tamale', 'well', 'up', 'why', 'people', 'tend', 'look', 'down', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'lethal', 'Lolita', 'tale', 'slick', 'garnishment', 'write', 'off', 'trash', 'exploitation', 'Regardless', 'what', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'Ghandi', 'Besides', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'similar', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'just', 'trash', 'exploitation', ""'re"", 'commentaries', 'power', 'woman', 'more', 'specifically', 'power', 'young', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'story', 'Ivy', 'troubled', 'past', 'blossoming', 'woman', 'power', 'bask', 'it.I', 'was', 'involved', 'church', 'number', 'years', 'granddaughter', 'pastor', 'was', 'aged', '17-22', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'Drew', 'league', 'as', 'far', 'beauty', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'yet', 'still', 'had', 'power', 'would', 'lie', 'people', 'spread', 'rumors', 'was', 'pastor', 'granddaughter', 'morons', 'would', 'believe', 'started', 'dating', 'naive', 'relative', 'mine', 'who', 'was', '19', 'years', 'senior', 'was', 'clear', 'was', 'just', 'interested', 'money', 'point', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'credit', 'card', 'info', 'bought', 'over', '17,000', 'worth', 'merchandise', 'knowing', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'did', 'everything', 'power', 'move', 'house', 'aging', 'mother', 'blocked', 'last', 'attempt', 'last', 'minute', 'mom', 'said', 'could', 'just', 'see', 'vixen', 'pushing', 'stairs', 'something', 'something', 'get', 'picture', 'was', 'discovered', 'little', 'tart', 'tried', 'buy', 'life', 'insurance', 'guy', 'was', 'very', 'odd', 'can', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions.My', 'point', 'lethal', 'Lolitas', 'exist', 'young', 'vixens', 'who', 'use', 'beauty', 'cause', 'havoc', 'ruin', 'lives', 'take', 'control', 'Trash', 'exploitation', 'not', 'good', 'fodder', 'movie', 'particularly', 'done', 'stylishly', 'Poison', 'Ivy', '.The', 'film', '88', 'minutes', 'unrated', 'version', '93', 'minutes', 'available', 'DVD.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A
