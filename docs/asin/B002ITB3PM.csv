1270780,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B002ITB3PM,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Jermaine and Bret are a pair of New Zealand musicians, living in New York City and hoping to hit it big. Yeah, ""Flight of the Conchords: The Complete Collection"" sounds like a terrible generic sitcom, but instead this series is one of the most hilarious comedies of the last decade -- a quirky, weird, tongue-in-cheek little show with hilarious dialogue. Think a musical version of ""The Office.""Folk-pop group Flight of the Conchords is Jermaine Clement and Bret McKenzie (played by themselves), who came all the way from New Zealand to New York. They are being managed by the ineffectual New Zealand Consulate official Murray (Rhys Darby), and they have exactly one fan/stalker, Mel (Kristen Schaal). They don't have many gigs, and even fewer successful ones.As they chase elusive fame'n'fortune, the guys have to deal with girlfriend woes (dating the same girl, a ""Yoko"", a girl who just wants to use Bret for sex), financial difficulties (Bret bought a cup!), jobs, muggings, anti-Kiwi racism, a problematic rock'n'roll tour, two new fans with impure intentions, a semi-professional actor/compulsive liar who makes Murray think they've got a multimillion-dollar deal, the Crazy Doggz, Australians, epileptic terriers, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, hair gel, and a stage musical based on their misadventures.If I had to come up with a description for ""Flight of the Conchords,"" it would be that they're the folky New Zealand love child of Spinal Tap and ""The Office."" No laugh track, rambling dialogue, and the main characters tend to spontaneously break into song-and-dance at pivotal parts of the plot. And it's brilliant.The writing is brimming over with effortless weirdness, as the guys encounter everyday problems (threesomes, girlfriend woes, weird dreams) which soon turn into hilariously surreal situations (the disturbing children's show, ""Albi the Racist Dragon""). The dialogue is amazing (""When I first met you you tried to have me deported from New Zealand because you thought I was an Australian""), and full of rambling conversations that just get stranger with every line (""Have you ever had a threesome?"" ""Nearly."" ""What do you mean, nearly?"" ""I've had a twosome"").The songs are gutsplitting as well, since they're all about homicidal robots, mermaids, toothpaste, hip-hop spoofs, hermaphrodites (""Oh you sexy hermaphrodite lady-man-ladies""), rappers, cannibalism, and the hiphop-potamus. Not to mention ""Frodo, Don't Wear the Ring"" and its accompanying music video, which are a nod to McKenzie's role as the elf Figwit.But none of this would be even half as funny if it weren't for the actors -- Clement's self-named chatacter is stoic and kind of weird (he writes a song about putting a wig on Bret), while McKenzie's is more childlike, naive and likes to sit in a cardboard box. Darby rounds out the cast as their harried, rather pathetic manager (who isn't even supposed to be managing a band), and Schaal is also quite funny as a woman who has a creepy sexual fixation on the guys.""Flight of the Conchords: The Complete Series"" is one of the rarest kind of comedy out there -- steady, hysterical, and only gets better with repeated viewings.

Then they released the Complete SECOND season.  Finally (well, almost) they released a package with both Seasons 1 AND 2 and added a CD of some of the soundtrack.  Well this time they have repackaged it AGAIN, replacing the Cd with ""new to DVD"" disc of their American TV debutin 2005  for HBO's One Night Stand  special. The special is just 25 minutes and has Bret and Jermaine on stage with their guitars singing song which never would have fit in the TV episodes because of length. The first one takes nearly nine minutes. Some are funnier than others - as you can tell from the live audience reaction - but its still fun to watch.There are many other reviews out there about each of the two seasons and I agree (with most of them) in that Season One is more consistently funny than Season Two (but there are great moments in Season Two). I think this is the case with most TV series. The best ideas come in the first season. I've given this set four stars based on this.Whether you need this set depends on whether you already have either (or both) of the previous packagings. The One Night Stand is for completists.

The show, about a folk duo trying to survive in New York City, is quite honestly one of the funniest and inventive comedies I've ever seen on the small screen. Infused with great songs and a fantastic supporting cast, the Conchords rises above most other comedy shows you've most likely seen. The second season finds the show hitting its creative stride and is even funnier than the first with some hilarious cameos and better overall production value.

It's just extremely odd. I can't quit express how odd it is. That's a good thing in my opinion.The show is two singers from New Zealand trying to make it in America and their manager. They are generally poor and get into odd situations. There's one where they get mugged and end up sort of friends with the muggers by the end. They also have their one fan who is something of a stalker. The show also intersperses some of their songs which are generally intended to just be funny. Somehow it all just works.If you like shows that are just a bit eschew and not quite normal, then you'll like this series.

However, this show is slightly different humor and the main characters seem to be the exact opposite of Jack Black. The show itself is better produced and higher quality, with more episodes and characters, it does a great job of crafting an interesting and fun universe for the viewer to grow comfortable with.As with Tenacious D, the show is very music-based. Each episode has at least two songs w/ 'music videos' of varying catchy-ness and quality (but generally speaking, all are great). The music ranges from all genres but generally falls in the soft-rock category, even so, the show is definitely acting/comedy first and 'musical' second.While the two dvd seasons are fantastic, the soundtrack is not complete (its actually their 'distant future' EP) and only has 5 tracks from the show. while it is a cool inclusion, but generally useless as a soundtrack itself and can be had for a couple dollars on other sites.Personally, i love the show, however just want to warn everyone that this set, currently priced at 45, can be had cheaper if bought separately and was 20 on Black Friday Week of 2009.",5,an excellent show yet questionable value set,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,1323,"['Flight', 'Conchords', 'fantastically', 'humorous', 'tale', 'two', 'dimwits', 'New', 'Zealend', 'who', 'come', 'NYC', 'hit', 'big', 'band.Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'HBO', 'Tenacious', 'D', 'will', 'feel', 'instantly', 'home', 'show', 'However', 'show', 'slightly', 'different', 'humor', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Jack', 'Black', 'show', 'better', 'produced', 'higher', 'quality', 'more', 'episodes', 'characters', 'great', 'job', 'crafting', 'interesting', 'fun', 'universe', 'viewer', 'grow', 'comfortable', 'with.As', 'Tenacious', 'D', 'show', 'very', 'music-based', 'episode', 'least', 'two', 'songs', 'w/', ""'music"", 'videos', 'varying', 'catchy-ness', 'quality', 'generally', 'speaking', 'are', 'great', 'music', 'genres', 'generally', 'soft-rock', 'category', 'even', 'so', 'show', 'definitely', 'acting/comedy', 'first', ""'musical"", 'second.While', 'two', 'dvd', 'seasons', 'are', 'fantastic', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'complete', 'actually', ""'distant"", 'future', 'EP', 'only', '5', 'tracks', 'show', 'cool', 'inclusion', 'generally', 'useless', 'soundtrack', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'couple', 'dollars', 'other', 'sites.Personally', 'i', 'love', 'show', 'however', 'just', 'want', 'warn', 'everyone', 'set', 'currently', 'priced', '45', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'cheaper', 'bought', 'separately', 'was', '20', 'Black', 'Friday', 'Week', '2009']",Flight of the Conchords: The Complete First and Second Seasons
