1084582,A1UWGR88UD16Z6,B000RZIGWM,"Edward Rasen Jr. ""ExecEditor""","[0, 0]","Twelfve episodes of Max and Ruby including two specifically devoted to christmas. Max and Ruby are brother and sister rabbits who live in a human's house and act like humans. Max, Ruby, Grandma and their friends are wonderful alter-ego characters for young children especially pre-schoolers.No violence. No insults. No adult jokes. No politics. These are much better than most adult programs. Obviously, these are broadcast on Nick Jr, a sub-channel of Nickelodeon and Nickelodeon is head and shoulders above or beyond Sesame Street. Nick knows how to educae and entertain children. Nick communicates to children as children communicate with each other.Each of the twelfve episodes are approximately 10 - 11 minutes and the total running time is 97 minutes. I highly recommend this disc and all the Max and Ruby discs. You must buy this and the others because your children will endlessly watch them. Kudoes to Nickelodeon for producing Max and Ruby. Hooray for Max and Ruby.
