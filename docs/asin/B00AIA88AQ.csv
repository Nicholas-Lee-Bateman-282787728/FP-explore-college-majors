With the release of ONCE MORE, WITH FEELING, all three of her best movies are now available on DVD ...LES GIRLS, THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE and now this one.

1610700,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,B00AIA88AQ,Classic film buff,"[0, 0]","It's poignant to watch this film, an intended comic battle of the sexes about a egotistical conductor Victor Fabian of the London Festival Orchestra(Yul Brynner)and his mercurial though charming wife Dolly(Kay Kendall). By the time of it's initial release in February 1960, Kay Kendall had been dead almost six months. She had been fighting leukemia for several years, but she was unaware of her condition, thinking that she had a severe iron deficiency.  However, her husband Rex Harrison knew the truth, and had confided it to several friends, and it seems it was an open secret in the theatrical community.  Filming was done in Paris, with Kendall's fragility becoming more and more evident.  When the film was two thirds completed, she had to be hospitalized, but managed to rally to wrap it up.In this film, you can see the physical evidence of her illness for the first time, Ms. Kendall looks painfully thin and frail, but still matchlessly elegant gowned in chic creations by Parisian courtier Hubert de Givenchy. Although the screenplay by Harry Kurnitz adapted from his Broadway play is very slight, Ms. Kendall rises to the occasion and turns in a final scintillating performance.  She is the best thing about the film, I just wish she had a stronger role for her last performance.Sophisticated, high styled comedy was not co-star Yul Brynner's forte, he comes off as heavy handed, and oddly Stanley Donen's direction so wonderful in ""Indiscreet"" is off kilter here.  Kay Kendall enchanting and effervescent is the reason you'll want to see ""Once More, with Feeling!"". My four star rating is solely for her, tragically a star that got away.",4,"""Farewell Kay...""",1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,1651,"['poignant', 'watch', 'film', 'intended', 'comic', 'battle', 'sexes', 'egotistical', 'conductor', 'Victor', 'Fabian', 'London', 'Festival', 'Orchestra', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'mercurial', 'charming', 'wife', 'Dolly', 'Kay', 'Kendall', 'time', 'initial', 'release', 'February', '1960', 'Kay', 'Kendall', 'had', 'been', 'dead', 'almost', 'six', 'months', 'had', 'been', 'fighting', 'leukemia', 'several', 'years', 'was', 'unaware', 'condition', 'thinking', 'had', 'severe', 'iron', 'deficiency', 'However', 'husband', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'knew', 'truth', 'had', 'confided', 'several', 'friends', 'was', 'open', 'secret', 'theatrical', 'community', 'Filming', 'was', 'done', 'Paris', 'Kendall', 'fragility', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'evident', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'two', 'thirds', 'completed', 'had', 'be', 'hospitalized', 'managed', 'rally', 'wrap', 'up.In', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'physical', 'evidence', 'illness', 'first', 'time', 'Ms.', 'Kendall', 'painfully', 'thin', 'frail', 'still', 'matchlessly', 'elegant', 'gowned', 'chic', 'creations', 'Parisian', 'courtier', 'Hubert', 'de', 'Givenchy', 'screenplay', 'Harry', 'Kurnitz', 'adapted', 'Broadway', 'play', 'very', 'slight', 'Ms.', 'Kendall', 'occasion', 'final', 'scintillating', 'performance', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'stronger', 'role', 'last', 'performance.Sophisticated', 'high', 'styled', 'comedy', 'was', 'not', 'co-star', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'forte', 'off', 'heavy', 'handed', 'oddly', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'direction', 'so', 'wonderful', 'Indiscreet', 'kilter', 'here', 'Kay', 'Kendall', 'enchanting', 'effervescent', 'reason', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'solely', 'tragically', 'star', 'got', 'away']","Once More, With Feeling"
1610701,ATYKXNLVOZN02,B00AIA88AQ,Constant Viewer,"[1, 1]","Most of the reviews here focus on this highly interesting film as a sparkling comedy enlivened by the exquisite final performance of the deeply regretted Kay Kendall.  There's no denying her success in lifting this film above its rather mediocre dramatic realities.  Perhaps her finest moment comes while she listens to a televised interview with Yul Brynner, as her husband---a monumentally (think Mount Rushmore) egotistical orchestra conductor.  Her ongoing reactions to his pompous and self-serving statements, which the audience immediately realize are so much crap, bring to mind one word: Vitameatavegemin.  You know what I mean.  Kendall's handling of that scene could have been hammed up to a fare-thee-well, but she handles it every bit as eloquently as the Vitameatavegemin lady handled that scene.Brynner's performance sadly suggests something of what might have been had the studios ever been able to decide what to do with him.  He presented formidable obstacles to being cast in major roles, starting of course with his bare scalp, but also arising from that matchlessly deep, sonorous voice and Russian accent.  He proved in ""Kings of the Sun"" that he was a viable action star, but even there he had to be cast as an exotic type---an Indian chief---to accommodate his appearance and speech.  ""Once more..."" shows that he had it in him to succeed in comic roles too, but again his persona got in the way. (""The Buccaneer,"" made around the same time as ""Once More..."" also gives him a few very effective comic moments, but there again he was given a wig and cast as a French pirate in the Caribbean.)  Apart from his repeated tours in ""The King and I,"" he was repeatedly cast as Europeans, evil Nazis or Russians threatening Hungarians or other Eastern Europeans.  Today he would probably have no trouble gaining access to a wider range of roles; for the 1950s and 60s, his choices were sadly limited, and his career suffered.One way the designer of this film got around Brynner's bare scalp was to meet it (pardon the expression) head-on.  Every work of art in the conductor's house, whether painting or sculpture, is of Brynner's character, so the audience is constantly brought face to face with that shaved head, itself a striking departure from established convention in the 1950s.  One might adopt that for one role, as Brynner himself did for ""The King and I"" in 1951, but until the more adventurous '60s nobody except Brynner kept it that way. (Telly Savalas first shaved for ""King of Kings"" in '62; the best-known of the other '60s skinheads, Shel Silverstein, adopted the tonsure only in '64 to deal with a receding hairline.)  Note that throughout the picture, whenever Brynner stands in front of one of the paintings (nearly all of which show him in dramatic conducting poses), he adopts the pose shown in the painting behind him.  Of course the ubiquitous display of Brynner's most recognizable feature is meant to demonstrate the conductor's immense ego even as it plays up the bald head AND at the same time, neatly diminishes its impact.  Surprisingly enough, it works.  It really does work.During a recent viewing of ""Once more..."" I suddenly (and unexpectedly) became aware of what a film like this must have seemed like to experienced eyes in the late 1950s. (I would have been 12 when I first saw it theatrically, so ""experienced"" didn't apply to me.)  The film contains a number of surprising bits of business and sight gags that must have struck knowing viewers as quite risqu&eacute;.  Two examples suffice.  In one scene, as Brynner and his agent are riding in the conductor's limousine, Brynner makes a suggestion to resolve a current crisis, a suggestion that strikes the agent as quite mad.  The agent takes the cigarette Brynner is smoking and sniffs it to be sure it's really just tobacco.  Today the implications are obvious, but I doubt that would have been the case for most people at the time this film was made and released.  Later, when Kendall is doing her magnificent best to resolve a quarrel between Brynner and the principal violinist in his orchestra, the violinist admits to her that he has one weak finger on his left hand (the hand that creates the pitches on a violin's fingerboard). He holds up that particular finger to show her.  You can guess which one it is.  I'm sure the actor playing the violinist was cast because of the unusual length of his fingers, that one in particular.  And gven that finger's implications, Kendall's restrained reaction to the sight of it is exquisitely priceless.There are other such moments, e.g., when Brynner escorts Kendall upstairs, obviously intending to engage in intimacy, and says he has ""a surprise"" for her; she archly asks ""Is it bigger than a breadbox?""  Including such fleeting but unmistakable references in what was supposedly a family film in Mamie Eisenhower's USA  could not possibly have been accidental. Coded though they may have been for an audience of that time, they are unmistakably THERE and make ""Once more..."" an unexpected point of departure from mainstream society of the '50s to the lurking changes of the '60s.  The subtlety with which these moments are embedded in the film makes them all the more enjoyable even now, at a time when we are far less sensitive to such things.For one major reason, I believe these allusions were deliberate.  The cast includes the familiar presence of Gregory Ratoff as the perpetually harried agent to the gifted great. Ratoff had trod the same ground in 1950's ""All About Eve,"" as agent to Bette Davis' temperamental Margo Channing.  In ""All About Eve,"" Ratoff's character was named Max Fabian, and in ""Once More..."" his first name is also Max.  The name of Brynner's character in ""Once More..."" is Victor Fabian, however, so the agent's last name is not Fabian but Archer.  I can't help concluding that Ratoff's casting was deliberate for just this reason---Ratoff's virtually identical character in both films, and the repetition of the names Fabian and Max.  If the production crew on ""Once More..."" was this attuned to these resonances in what they were doing, they were attuned as well to other resonances, so I think they knew all about ""Once More's..."" subtly embedded allusions to subterranean currents that would tumultuously become so markedly less subterranean by 1970.A major plot theme is, moreover, the fact that Brynner and Kendall are not married; everybody thinks they are, but they've really been living together for 8 years.  Unwed cohabitation was not unknown in 1960 but it wasn't advertised as honestly as nowadays.  I think this got past the censors only because the film is not set in the pristine USA of those distant days, but in London, so it didn't have to be seen as a straightforward picture of US society.  People over there did that sort of thing all the time, and Brynner is supposed to be an artsy type, and in the end they do get married. It's foreign and safe, so it's OK. None the less, so open an acknowledgment of Living In Sin must have been at least mildly surprising to US audiences of that day.To sum up, we've got 2 solid comedic performances from 2 very competent actors; highly imaginative and successful set design that contributes a great deal to the film's success; a literate script and skilled direction that point toward changes that were on the brink of transforming the world.  What's not to like?  Not much I can think of.  Maybe those novelties, and the then-hidden realities they suggested, were what kept this little jewel from the wider recognition it deserved. I'd like to know, but probably we never will find out.  So just enjoy this very special film.  Enjoy it a lot.",5,A Real Point of Departure,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,7691,"['Most', 'reviews', 'here', 'focus', 'highly', 'interesting', 'film', 'sparkling', 'comedy', 'enlivened', 'exquisite',

As the most egocentric symphony conductor of all time, Brynner carries it with no sense of seeming a fool; He's convinced of his greatness and allows others to acknowledge that. Kay kendall as his &#34;wife&#34; is at her charming, comedic best. This was her last film, she died of Leukemia before it was released. To explain why it's amusing, droll, comedic is an impossibility. It just is. Some will find this a bit too English in subtext but the lines are witty, the situation different and the supporting players just perfect. (Gregory Ratoff as Brynner's manager has several oaths to swear if he's lying. My favorite being, &#34;May my whole troup of Russian Ballet Dancers come down with Hoof and Mouth Diesease If I'm lying.&#34; He was lying. More than fifty years since it was made, it looks modern, contemporary and that is due ot the Genius of Hubert de Givenchy who designed the wardrobe for Miss Kendall. (He had a knack for film actresses; His best remembered gown is the black one worn by Audrey Hepburn in &#34;Breakfast At Tiffany's&#34;.The plot is genuinely clever coming with a couple of twists that take it beyond simple farce and move it gently to social comedy that is both believable and terribly funny at the same time. Kendall and Brynner are perfect foils for each other, his ego and her ability to snap back are perfection. Sad to think that they might have become another famous acting pair in the manner of Hepburn and Tracy. The chemistry is there.For those who are too accustomed to television sitcom comedy, this will seem slow, mannered but that's becasuse it's a comedy of both with and situation not just set up, joke, set up, joke. One is led, sometimes kicked, from scene to scene and it's a welcome trip.It's a film of a type no longer made which is really too bad.

I remembered watching it on TMC years ago, and ever since then I have been searching for it high and low...and leave it to Amazon to have it!!This is a hilarious film! Yul Brenner is just fantastic, it is a shame he did not do more comedy. His timing and wit are classic! And Ka Kendall was a force of nature--both on the screen, and off given how ill she was during the making of this film. She was a great loss to the film industry. There was also great chemistry between these too, which made the film even more fun to watch. This is definitely one to have in your classic film collection.Thank You Amazon for carrying this rare and hard to find title!!",5,Love this movie!!,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,698,"['am', 'so', 'glad', 'finally', 'found', 'movie', 'remembered', 'watching', 'TMC', 'years', 'ago', 'ever', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'searching', 'high', 'low', 'leave', 'Amazon', 'have', 'hilarious', 'film', 'Yul', 'Brenner', 'just', 'fantastic', 'shame', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'more', 'comedy', 'timing', 'wit', 'are', 'classic', 'Ka', 'Kendall', 'was', 'force', 'nature', 'screen', 'given', 'how', 'ill', 'was', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'loss', 'film', 'industry', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'chemistry', 'too', 'made', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'definitely', 'one', 'have', 'classic', 'film', 'collection.Thank', 'Amazon', 'carrying', 'rare', 'hard', 'find', 'title']","Once More, With Feeling"

1610707,AXHCIHVT92GYF,B00AIA88AQ,The CinemaScope Cat,"[0, 0]","When the wife (Kay Kendall) of a narcissistic and high strung orchestra conductor (Yul Brynner) catches him with a young girl (Shirley Anne Field), she leaves him. When she wants to get married again, she asks for a divorce but there's one small problem ..... they were never married in the first place! So they must secretly get married and then divorced (this is 1960 after all) so she'll be free to marry again. But the conductor, who's still on love with her, has other plans. Based on an only modestly successful Broadway farce by Harry Kurnitz (who also wrote the screenplay), material like this needs to sparkle like champagne. What we get is a drink of tepid water. Watching the actors flapping around in an attempt to induce laughter, one calmly listens to the dull dialog thinking, &#34;Oh, there's supposed to be a laugh here&#34; as you sit there stone faced. Brynner is all wrong for this kind of farce that cries out for a Rex Harrison or even a Danny Kaye. He just doesn't have the comic timing needed. Kendall (who died at 33 before the film opened) looks stunning in her Givenchy outfits, fares better but nothing is going to help. It's a static film that lazily doesn't even bother to hide its stage bound roots. Directed by Stanley Donen (SINGIN' IN THE RAIN), who usually has a better touch for material like this. With Gregory Ratoff, rechanneling his Max Fabian from ALL ABOUT EVE and Martin Benson.The Sony MOD DVDr is a very nice anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer.",3,Fizzles when it should sparkle,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,1493,"['When', 'wife', 'Kay', 'Kendall', 'narcissistic', 'high', 'strung', 'orchestra', 'conductor', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'young', 'girl', 'Shirley', 'Anne', 'Field', 'When', 'get', 'married', 'again', 'divorce', 'one', 'small', 'problem', '..', 'were', 'never', 'married', 'first', 'place', 'must', 'secretly', 'get', 'married', 'then', 'divorced', '1960', ""'ll"", 'be', 'free', 'marry', 'again', 'conductor', 'who', 'still', 'love', 'other', 'plans', 'Based', 'only', 'modestly', 'successful', 'Broadway', 'farce', 'Harry', 'Kurnitz', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'material', 'sparkle', 'champagne', 'What', 'get', 'drink', 'tepid', 'water', 'Watching', 'actors', 'flapping', 'around', 'attempt', 'induce', 'laughter', 'one', 'calmly', 'dull', 'dialog', 'thinking', '34', 'Oh', 'supposed', 'be', 'laugh', 'here', '34', 'sit', 'stone', 'faced', 'Brynner', 'wrong', 'kind', 'farce', 'out', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'even', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'comic', 'timing', 'needed', 'Kendall', 'who', 'died', '33', 'film', 'opened', 'stunning', 'Givenchy', 'outfits', 'better', 'nothing', 'going', 'help', 'static', 'film', 'lazily', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'hide', 'stage', 'bound', 'roots', 'Directed', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'SINGIN', 'IN', 'THE', 'RAIN', 'who', 'usually', 'better', 'touch', 'material', 'Gregory', 'Ratoff', 'rechanneling', 'Max', 'Fabian', 'ALL', 'ABOUT', 'EVE', 'Martin', 'Benson.The', 'Sony', 'MOD', 'DVDr', 'very', 'nice', 'anamorphic', 'wide', 'screen', '1.85', 'transfer']","Once More, With Feeling"
