775737,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0000CDRW5,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","Wisdom learned the hard way: never try to watch Ellen when it hurts to laugh.It's 2003, and she looks so young, so sweet, so innocent. And of course she knows how to use that face for laughs. She starts with the obligatory gay jokes, just to get it over with, and gets in a few zingers like the people who worry that others will think they are gay because they showed up at this show. But once she's had some five to ten minutes of getting that subject out of the way, the rest is her stream-of-consciousness that, for example, dissects procrastination and turns it to a thing to be proud of. She makes the point that people are forever worrying what other people are thinking of them, when in fact what they are thinking is worrying what you think of them. A variety of minor embarrassing moments are flawlessly executed.Ellen has the gift of being able to say what the rest of us only think. Yoga, for example. It's really about paying for quiet. So you get yourself in a lotus position, get all your chakras properly aligned, looking out at the world with your third eye, and trying to appreciate the silence. What do you hear?

Through it all, she received rave reviews from many critics, describing it as hilarious and entertaining.  ""Here And Now"" explores her New York visit, which is no exception.  Her routine expresses how great of a comedienne she truly is.  This DVD is one of three performances that proves that 2003 was her biggest year since 1997, the year she came out with her sexuality.  The premiere of her new show ""The Ellen Show"" and receiving rave reviews for her performance on ""Finding Nemo"" followed.Though nothing beats the live experience, ""Here And Now"" commemorates that beautifully.  It explores a variety of topics, including procrastination, technology, music, and others.  Though many may expect gay issues, she shares them briefly.  She proves herself as one of the most unique comediennes of modern day.  Amazingly, she can act out the simplest things, and audiences react with hardcore laughs.  Even pushing a button and eating popcorn become unforgettable scenes.  Unlike many other bigname comedians/ comediennes, her performances are mostly vocal rather than physical.  Such talents prove that her humor is natural.  Her expressions through her voice and her face wonderfully add to the fun.  Nothing controversial is featured in this performance (not that controversy is a bad thing).  She never uses any discriminatory words.  Through the laughter, she acknowledges the true importances in life.Her great performance makes ""Here And Now"" worth watching several times.  This is sure to keep audiences laughing through the entire hour feature.

""Here and Now"" is a masterful presentation that brings to our attention the heart of American life today.  It's amazing how eloquently she nail's the vague, deeply unsettling core adversity that represents the hallmark of American citizens lives today, while making us laugh hysterically at our weakness.I've always admired Ellen, seeing in her a wise, compassionate, deep soul that loves and understands people.  She has courageously sacrificed herself to offer humanity a kind service with the gift of her humor, even as she vulnerably exposed her true self publicly, knowing she would face the heavy burden of society's judgement.  In ""Here and Now"", Ellen has never been more beautiful, witty, humble and radiant, a woman who has attained her full potential with grace, and this all makes the subject matter of her show more touching on a personal level.This is a must-see for all, especially for baby-boomers and early Gen-Xer's, who will so easily relate and laugh at ourselves and our lives, poignantly bringing us back in touch with life before the chaos, when things were so much simpler, and joy could be experienced in the little things that mattered.Bravo, Ellen!  What a beautiful way to share your vision and help us all more aware that we can make life what we want it to be more like - if we choose.  I could not help but enjoy the show even more so, for ""seeing"" that lovable little blue fish called Dori in my mind - they both share so much in common.",5,"Ellen shines in this briliant, witty, poignant look at life today, and how much has changed!",1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,1648,"['Ellen', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'era', 'sociological', 'crisis', 'understanding', 'fundamental', 'issue', 'critically', 'impacted', 'human', 'nature', 'whole', 'individual', 'level', 'Here', 'Now', 'masterful', 'presentation', 'attention', 'heart', 'American', 'life', 'today', 'amazing', 'how', 'eloquently', 'nail', 'vague', 'deeply', 'unsettling', 'core', 'adversity', 'hallmark', 'American', 'citizens', 'lives', 'today', 'making', 'hysterically', 'weakness.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'admired', 'Ellen', 'seeing', 'wise', 'compassionate', 'deep', 'soul', 'understands', 'people', 'courageously', 'sacrificed', 'offer', 'humanity', 'kind', 'service', 'gift', 'humor', 'even', 'vulnerably', 'exposed', 'true', 'self', 'publicly', 'knowing', 'would', 'face', 'heavy', 'burden', 'society', 'judgement', 'Here', 'Now', 'Ellen', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'beautiful', 'witty', 'humble', 'radiant', 'woman', 'who', 'attained', 'full', 'potential', 'grace', 'subject', 'matter', 'show', 'more', 'touching', 'personal', 'level.This', 'must-see', 'especially', 'baby-boomers', 'early', 'Gen-Xer', 'who', 'will', 'so', 'easily', 'relate', 'laugh', 'ourselves', 'lives', 'poignantly', 'bringing', 'back', 'touch', 'life', 'chaos', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'simpler', 'joy', 'could', 'be', 'experienced', 'little', 'things', 'mattered.Bravo', 'Ellen', 'What', 'beautiful', 'way', 'share', 'vision', 'help', 'more', 'aware', 'can', 'make', 'life', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'more', 'choose', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'enjoy', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'seeing', 'lovable', 'little', 'blue', 'fish', 'called', 'Dori', 'mind', 'share', 'so', 'much', 'common']",N/A

I travelled over form Belfast to see the show, got front row seats and was also fortunate enough to get to ask the lady a question at the end of the show.....wot a lady (I am hoping there may be extrs of audience questions....).  This DVD testifies the irrepressible force that is Degeneres, and is a great catch-up opportunity for anyone not familiar with Ellen prior to her daytime talk show (I've seen about 10 shows of it and they're a riot!).  This stand-up show digresses around the theme of procrastination, containing laff-out loud and painfully realistic observations of everyday human idiosyncranices....from the brilliant observation of brand new cds to the riotous observations of waving at someone you think you know, I was rolling in the aisles at this.  My hat goes off to her, she has fought adversity in recent years and come out (metaphorically, lol) a true winner....Finding Nemo, an awesome talk-show and this truly original and entertaining fun show...the lady has it all.
