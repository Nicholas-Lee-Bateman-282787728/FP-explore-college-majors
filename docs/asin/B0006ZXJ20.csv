It does strike up good point that are a problem in the south asian community. Married into the asian community, and living in the same city where they filmed this and so many of the actors from here. I can say it is a big issue with the Asian community about their identities. Especially the new generations of Asians being born in the USA. They have the old way and new way hitting them and mostly they choose to be like everyone else and go for the new way. In that they think they are better then other Asian who are new here or choose their culture over fitting in. For this point I think the movie is showing this very well, though a little overboard. In regard to the comedy it is funny at times, but it not hilariously funny.

This isn't your average American teen flick, but an insightfully humorous look at the young Desi (South Asian) community in America.  The story centers around a Fresh off the Boat (FOB) Indian, Hari Patel, who moves to America to attend college while living with his Uncle's family.  Before his journey, a local guru predicts Hari will meet his destined wife in America whose name begins with ""P"" and will fall upon him in a fever during a full moon.  Hari is thrilled about his trip to America and can't wait for his  cousin, played by ""Van Wilder's"" Kal Penn, to introduce him to his hip American friends.Kal Penn's character does everything in his power to avoid Hari because FOBs like him represent all the un-cool things about his Indian heritage.

The fact that this difference or tension is examined in a college setting gives it the funny edge. While the movie was entertaining, there were parts where it lacked that funny edge.The person who stands out like a star in this movie is Kal Penn of Harold and Kumar fame.A familiarity with the South Asian community may help in better understanding and appreciating the movie.

I'm a white american, but I think I have more respect for indian people than american-born indian people seem to.  Just because they were born in India, our american-born indian people treat their own kind like they are ignorant foreigners.  Yes, we all know that indians from India follow stupid religions and religious practices, and their hygiene needs improvement, but these people need patient help from their american-born brothers and sisters. I guess Kal Penn was born in america.  He doesn't ever seem to show his Indian pride.  It seems that he enjoys ridiculing his heritage.I enjoyed watching this film as I do any indian-oriented film because indian girls are all so beautiful and I'm glad to see them coming to america and living a new life of self-respect and dignity (that is, if their India born parents aren't still insistent on their warped religious practices).Anyone that meets a FOB (fresh off the boat) from any country (who's entered this country legally and is pursuing an education to enhance their american dream), should be treated with more respect.This movie has laughs, but the attitudes of some american-born indians is disturbing and not so funny.",3,One of several american made indian themed movies,1226188800,"11 9, 2008",2008,1247,"['movie', 'was', 'okay', 'did', 'make', 'little', 'uncomfortable', ""'m"", 'white', 'american', 'think', 'have', 'more', 'respect', 'indian', 'people', 'american-born', 'indian', 'people', 'seem', 'Just', 'were', 'born', 'India', 'american-born', 'indian', 'people', 'treat', 'own', 'kind', 'are', 'ignorant', 'foreigners', 'Yes', 'know', 'indians', 'India', 'follow', 'stupid', 'religions', 'religious', 'practices', 'hygiene', 'improvement', 'people', 'need', 'patient', 'help', 'american-born', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'guess', 'Kal', 'Penn', 'was', 'born', 'america', ""n't"", 'ever', 'seem', 'show', 'Indian', 'pride', 'ridiculing', 'heritage.I', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'do', 'indian-oriented', 'film', 'indian', 'girls', 'are', 'so', 'beautiful', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'coming', 'america', 'living', 'new', 'life', 'self-respect', 'dignity', 'India', 'born', 'parents', 'are', ""n't"", 'still', 'insistent', 'warped', 'religious', 'practices', '.Anyone', 'FOB', 'fresh', 'boat', 'country', 'who', 'entered', 'country', 'legally', 'pursuing', 'education', 'enhance', 'american', 'dream', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'more', 'respect.This', 'movie', 'laughs', 'attitudes', 'american-born', 'indians', 'disturbing', 'not', 'so', 'funny']","Dude, Where's The Party?"
