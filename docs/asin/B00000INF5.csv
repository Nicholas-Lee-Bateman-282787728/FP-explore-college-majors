This dvd is a good look into his career, circa 1997 before the infamous Montreal screw job. Lots of uncensored WWF footage and shows Hart with his family.

If you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of the WWF/WWE, then this one is for you. A fitting sad ending where Hart is walking with his frail father, Stu, into the famous Hart house and tells us Hart is currently with wrestling with WCW.

504202,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,B00000INF5,"C. Baker ""cbaker""","[4, 4]","This documentary details a short period in the career of professional wrestler Bret Hart.  It just so happens that is filmed during the infamous Montreal Screwjob.At the time of this documentary in 1997 Bret Hart was the World Wrestling Federation champion.  He had somewhat of a falling out with Vince McMahon and decided to leave for a rival promotion.  His contract stipulated he had creative control over his character if he decided to leave for the last 30 days of his tenure.  Not wanting to drop the title to rival Shawn Michaels in front of his Canadian and Montreal fans, he and McMahon agreed that the match would end in outside interference and brawl in the ring with no real conclusion to the fight.  In return, Hart promised to drop the title to Michaels on a later date.That was how the fight was supposed end.  Instead, McMahon and Michaels concocted a scenario where Michaels would put Hart in a submission hold.  Hart was supposed to reverse it but as soon as the hold was administered in the ring McMahon came out and had the bell rung to end the fight and awarded the match to Michaels.All the preliminary angst by Hart of his distrust of McMahon and the aftermath was recorded on film for posterity.While the Montreal Screwjob was not the only aspect of the ring life of Hart chronicled here, that was the culmination of the film and what makes it a valuable piece.While this film is very interesting there are some flaws.  The main flaw is I felt the scenes with Bret Hart and his wife talking about his contract with the WWF and trying to decide whether to leave seemed very scripted.  Also, there really is not a lot of detail on the intense animosity between Hart and Shawn Michaels that is detailed in Bret Hart's autobiography, Hitman.Nevertheless, it is an interesting look into the world of professional wrestling and a snapshot of Bret Hart's later ring career.This particular DVD also contains a biography of the career of Bret Hart's younger brother,  Owen Hart, and the tragic accident that lead to his death.",3,Bret the Hitman Hart and the Montreal Screwjob,1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,2041,"['documentary', 'details', 'short', 'period', 'career', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'just', 'so', 'filmed', 'infamous', 'Montreal', 'Screwjob.At', 'time', 'documentary', '1997', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'was', 'World', 'Wrestling', 'Federation', 'champion', 'had', 'somewhat', 'falling', 'out', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'decided', 'leave', 'rival', 'promotion', 'contract', 'stipulated', 'had', 'creative', 'control', 'character', 'decided', 'leave', 'last', '30', 'days', 'tenure', 'Not', 'wanting', 'drop', 'title', 'rival', 'Shawn', 'Michaels', 'front', 'Canadian', 'Montreal', 'fans', 'McMahon', 'agreed', 'match', 'would', 'end', 'outside', 'interference', 'brawl', 'ring', 'real', 'conclusion', 'fight', 'return', 'Hart', 'promised', 'drop', 'title', 'Michaels', 'later', 'was', 'how', 'fight', 'was', 'supposed', 'end', 'Instead', 'McMahon', 'Michaels', 'concocted', 'scenario', 'where', 'Michaels', 'would', 'put', 'Hart', 'submission', 'hold', 'Hart', 'was', 'supposed', 'reverse', 'as', 'soon', 'hold', 'was', 'administered', 'ring', 'McMahon', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'bell', 'rung', 'end', 'fight', 'awarded', 'match', 'Michaels.All', 'preliminary', 'angst', 'Hart', 'distrust', 'McMahon', 'aftermath', 'was', 'recorded', 'film', 'Montreal', 'Screwjob', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'aspect', 'ring', 'life', 'Hart', 'chronicled', 'here', 'was', 'culmination', 'film', 'what', 'valuable', 'piece.While', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'are', 'flaws', 'main', 'flaw', 'felt', 'scenes', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'wife', 'talking', 'contract', 'WWF', 'trying', 'decide', 'leave', 'seemed', 'very', 'scripted', 'Also', 'really', 'not', 'lot', 'detail', 'intense', 'animosity', 'Hart', 'Shawn', 'Michaels', 'detailed', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'autobiography', 'Hitman.Nevertheless', 'interesting', 'look', 'world', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'snapshot', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'later', 'ring', 'career.This', 'particular', 'DVD', 'also', 'biography', 'career', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'younger', 'brother', 'Owen', 'Hart', 'tragic', 'accident', 'lead', 'death']",N/A

My two heroes were The Undertaker and the man featured in this docu, Bret The Hitman Hart. When I saw the SS in 97 I was shocked at what was unraveling before my eyes. This was too real to be just a storyline, this was an already ""turned heel"" hero being ripped apart and broken in just a few minutes. To me it seems that Bret still hasn't made it through the darkness that was brought upon by this and the tragedies afterwards. (Such as the death of his little brother Owen in a WWE stunt) I cringed when Bret ""turned heel"" in his last year at the WWE, it was so obviously fake and a built up to destroy his legacy. Sadly Bret, being a man of honor, truth and honesty, didn't see through the devious plotting of Vince and his ilk.Wrestling With Shadows had me in tears so many times. Not just because of the SS 97 incident but because it turned a once happy, hopeful and positive man into a tormented, disillusioned shadow of his former self. As for business re: Bret not being allowed to retire from WWE as the reigning champion.....HOW MANY TIMES were there exceptions in that damn company? Couldn't they have arranged a fab Goodbye ceremony for their greatest athlete with the highlight being Bret passing the torch to the next generation? Would that have been bad ""business""?Bret The Hitman Hart has shown immense strength, integrity and he has given millions of kids and adults all over the world what we all need: A hero. A hero who believes in the good in folks and who stands erect and strong against all odds. Bret Hart still is this hero.

As the film goes on, we get to see that something is wrong in the relationship between Bret Hart and Vince McMahon which leads up to the big ""Montreal Screwjob"" in November 1997. Even Bret's wife at the time accussed HHH and Shawn of being in on it (which we now know they were)!Personal note, I think both parties were wrong. Bret, knowing he was leaving, should've jobbed the title. However, if Vince told him that it was going to be a Double DQ, then that's how it should've went down. He could've did an angle where Bret gets stripped right after the match due to his conduct in the match or something.I am no booker but I would've left the Double DQ intact, then either do the strip angle or have Bret do an angle where he pretty much says ""screw WWF"" and drops the belt at McMahon's feet and leaves! From there, I would've vacated the title and did the Royal Rumble thing were the winner gets the title shot and make the Casket Match with Undertaker and Shawn Michaels where the winner of that would be in the title match at WrestleMania as well!Back to this video, its worth a look. No matter whether you love or hate Vince McMahon or Bret Hart, this was definitely one of the darkest periods of wrestling ever. Both sides suffered on this one.

I think the Ironic part about this, is that this was made during the time that WCW was threating to put WWF out of business and yet 4 years later, Vince Mcmahon bought WCW, and a few months after this released in 1998, Raw began beating Nitro.I always got the feeling that Bret Hart exaggerated on a lot of his facts, because it almost seemed like he was trying to act instead of being himself. I love the backstage look at wrestling in this, but as far as the story goes, i am not convinced that Bret Hart or Vince Mcmahon are being 100% honest in this, because i find it strange that this would release and totally bash Vince Mcmahons character and yet he didn't say anything about it.By all means, if you like it, watch it.

Watching(in hindsight) him tell Hart he wants him to go to WCW, then lie about why he was leaving, lie about the supposed ending of the match at Survivor Series, and ultimately lie about everything to do with Hart is pretty disgusting to watch. If wrestling lasts 1000 more years, we will never have as compelling footage as is on here from that match. Watching Earl Hebner practically dive out of the ring as soon as he calls for the bell, and Mcmahon wiping the spit from his face as Hart glares at him from the ring with disgust is absolutely riveting. It's just a shame that they didn't include the part of the Mcmahon interview where he claims he &quot;let&quot; Bret knock him out afterwards.

Bret Hart seems to fall under both of these mantles, some very vew wrestlers can claim. He may not have been the flashiest guy, or the most flamboyant, but Bret was dedicated 100% to his career, something that he paid the price for in his personal and family life.Hitman Hart: Wrestling With Shadows, documents that event caused Bret's career in WWE to come to a controversial end, a double-cross talked to even to this day. Wrestling might be sports-entertainment, but the politics behind the curtains are very real, and often very ugly.This documentary follows Hart from his return to wrestling at Survivor Series 1996 against Stone Cold Steve Austin, to his final WWE match against Shawn Michaels one year later. Hart is very honest, and very frank about what he thinks about some of his fellow wrestlers, Michaels in particular.The documentary is very well done, cut very well, and helps offer one insight into what was going through Hart's mind during this time, dealing with changes in mindsets of wrestling fans, Vince's decision to turn him hel, which would forever affect his character and direction in WWE, and the confrontations surrounding Survivor Series 1997 and the infamous Montreal Screwjob.If You're a Bret Hart fan, pick this up.

This incident sent shockwaves through wrestling and caused a major rift between all three men, the story has been told before but this dvd gives us a behind the scenes look at Bret's final few months in the WWE up to the day in Montreal, Canada where this screwjob happened.This documentary is quite well done, the interview pieces and behind the curtain look really does lend some realism to the personal feelings everyone involved felt leading up to the day in Montreal. Bret seems very honest and real when he talks about his career and how he views himself, I personally loved hearing from Bret, seeing all the backstage footage of the various wrestlers including the members of the Hart Foundation stable, Brian Pillman, Jim Neidhart, British Bulldog and Bret's late brother Owen Hart.Its actually well filmed, very well paced, you really get a feel from all those involved, especially Bret, who had his own reasons for wanting to do the match in Montreal his way. Its just too bad things couldn't be worked out between Vince and Bret, which lead to so much animosity that they didn't talk for years. Mind you of course in the past years things have been patched up between Bret, Vince and even Bret and Shawn.This is a great look at what was and still is a very important moment in wrestling history, a wonderful look at the personal lives of Bret and his family and if you're a wrestling fan you will enjoy this documentary as it does tear down the walls of the WWE at that time.Also included is a special dvd about the death of Owen Hart, where Bret talks about his brother's life and how his death has affected the family and Bret personally.

504218,AT1GMH2UHYROT,B00000INF5,Lee DeWald,"[32, 36]","Bret &quot;Hitman&quot; Hart has been my favorite wrestler ever since I first watched this documentary on A&amp;E a few years ago.  He had always been a great wrestler, but after having watched this riveting tale of Hart's association with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1996-97, he became my hero.Bret Hart's tale in this video is both happy and sad.  In the beginning moments of the film, we see a light-hearted and very accomodating Hitman talking about his family and how he started in wrestling.  He talks about growing up a Hart, and how life at the house was not always so wonderful.  For the first 20-30 minutes, this film shows us the happier side of Bret Hart.  And that's when things get interesting.World Championship Wrestling (WCW) made Hart an incredible offer that he almost couldn't refuse.  But, as a man of integrity and moral values, he inititally declined the WCW's offer out of loyalty to Vince McMahon, the owner of the WWF.  Instead of taking a three-year contract worth $9 million from the WCW, he signed a 20-year contract for significantly less with the WWF.Bret Hart's topsy-turvy road in 1997 is a captivating one to travel on for the audience.  Anyone who knows wrestling knows the name Bret Hart and what has happened with him throughout his career.  This documentary, so beautifully done by director Paul Jay, gives you the dirt on what Hart's life was like back when wrestling was just starting to come into its more adult nature.This film gives you the entire scoop on why Bret Hart was turned heel (turned into a bad guy).  This film shows you exactly what happened at the now infamous 1997 Survivor Series, which forever changed the direction of WWF programming.  You will see it all as the happy and appreciative Bret Hart from the first 20-30 minutes is slowly chipped away until a depressed and demoralized Bret Hart is left in the wake of what the WWF and Vince McMahon did to him.After the film, there is a special interview with Bret Hart and director Paul Jay that takes place 18 months later following the double-cross at the 1997 Survivor Series.  Bret Hart goes on to tell what life has been like since his departure from the WWF and how things in his life have drastically changed.  One shock, for example, is his admittance of his divorce.  This comes as such a surprise since we see him and his wife sticking so closely together in the film.In short, this is one of the best wrestling documentaries out there.  They don't get any more real than this, and any wrestling fan will find Bret Hart's real-life battle with Vince McMahon intriguing.On a personal note, Bret Hart, in my mind, will always be the Excellence of Execution.  He will always be &quot;The Best There Is, The Best There Was, and The Best There Ever Will Be.&quot;  He deserved to have a grand exit from professional wrestling.

""mattb123""","[6, 7]","I still remember when this documentary first aired back in '98 or so (the DVD is the 10-year anniversary of the original DVD, as opposed to when the documentary first aired).  I believe it aired on A&E; or one of those similar cable channels.  Basically, a camera crew followed around WWF (now known as ""WWE"") wrestler, Bret Hart, filming his WWE professional life and personal life including his contract negotations with WWE owner Vince McMahon.  The documentary is somewhat unique as up until this point there had been little done or shown behind-the-scenes on pro wrestling.  Further, it just so happened that the year that was filmed led up to...and included...one of the most renowned and ""real-life"" controversies in the recent history of pro-wrestling ""The Montreal Screwjob."" (Granted, this documentary may have helped make it one of the most memorable and controversial events...).  Since the night of ""the Screwjob,"" everyone involved has had their say on what happened...  Wellllll (as ""Hawk"" would say), on this DVD you'll see exactly who got caught on camera saying what (and lying to Bret's face).  If you have an opinion...or interest...you'll want to watch it.  If you don't have an opinion or know the full story, you might decide to ""wikipedia"" it after watching this...there have been various ""revelations"" made in the years since, including admissions by Shawn Michaels.  It's a prime example of how - as strange as wrestling storylines may seem to many - the behind-the-scenes stories can be just as unusual!Beyond the ""screwjob,"" there's much more covered in this documentary including Bret's struggles to balance his family life and wrestling career, his negotiations with Vince up until the time Bret departed the WWE, and battles with himself trying to decide what was best to do.  Some of the ""spin"" around that time was that Bret and others ""sold out"" and left Vince McMahon and the WWE in a bind; but again this documentary provides new insight about that - at least as far as Bret goes.  I also found memorable a scene with Bret expressing to some fellow wrestlers his true feelings about other wrestlers (such as Michaels and Triple H), and on the direction and storylines the Federation was taking.Overall, after viewing this I definitely came away thinking that Bret was ""old-school"" and a ""traditionalist"" struggling in a business that seemed to be changing from what he believed it was or should be.  Bret is an interesting study - he's a hero in Canada, the all-time favorite of many wrestling fans, and clearly drew strong opinions about the changing sport and the way he was dis-loyally treated.  But others see him as inflexible and taking things a little too seriously, which may have led to his bitterness.  After viewing this the viewer can draw their own opinion...but if you know Bret's full story you cannot argue that he sacrificed all (and paid a very heavy toll indeed) for the sport that he dedicated his life to!I would add this DVD isn't very redundant even if you've seen the Brett Hart DVD set or read his book (and I recommend those if you're a WWE or Bret Hart fan too).New to this ""10-year anniversary"" edition are additional updated interviews (""10 years later..."" with Bret and others) as well as a documentary on the life and death of Owen Hart (Bret's younger brother, also a wrestler, who died doing a stunt during a ""pay-per-view"" event that took place not long after Bret left the WWE...and yet the PPV event continued!!!).",5,Very Good and Infamous Wrestling Documentary!,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,3486,"['still', 'remember', 'when', 'documentary', 'first', 'aired', 'back', ""'98"", 'so', 'DVD', '10-year', 'anniversary', 'original', 'DVD', 'opposed', 'when', 'documentary', 'first', 'aired', 'believe', 'aired', 'A', 'E', 'one', 'similar', 'cable', 'channels', 'Basically', 'camera', 'crew', 'followed', 'WWF', 'now', 'known', 'WWE', 'wrestler', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'filming', 'WWE', 'professional', 'life', 'personal', 'life', 'including', 'contract', 'negotations', 'WWE', 'owner', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'documentary', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'up', 'point', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'done', 'shown', 'behind-the-scenes', 'pro', 'wrestling', 'Further', 'just', 'so', 'happened', 'year', 'was', 'filmed', 'led', 'up', 'included', 'one', 'most', 'renowned', 'real-life', 'controversies', 'recent', 'history', 'pro-wrestling', 'Montreal', 'Screwjob', 'Granted', 'documentary', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'controversial', 'events', 'night', 'Screwjob', 'everyone', 'involved', 'had', 'say', 'what', 'happened', 'Wellllll', 'Hawk', 'would', 'say', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'see', 'exactly', 'who', 'got', 'caught', 'camera', 'saying', 'what', 'lying', 'Bret', 'face', 'have', 'opinion', 'interest', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'opinion', 'know', 'full', 'story', 'might', 'decide', 'wikipedia', 'watching', 'have', 'been', 'various', 'revelations', 'made', 'years', 'including', 'admissions', 'Shawn', 'Michaels', 'prime', 'example', 'how', 'as', 'strange', 'wrestling', 'storylines', 'may', 'seem', 'many', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stories', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'unusual', 'screwjob', 'much', 'more', 'covered', 'documentary', 'including', 'Bret', 'struggles', 'balance', 'family', 'life', 'wrestling', 'career', 'negotiations', 'Vince', 'up', 'time', 'Bret', 'departed', 'WWE', 'battles', 'trying', 'decide', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'do', 'spin', 'time', 'was', 'Bret', 'others', 'sold', 'out', 'left', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'WWE', 'bind', 'again', 'documentary', 'new', 'insight', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'Bret', 'also', 'found', 'memorable', 'scene', 'Bret', 'expressing', 'fellow', 'wrestlers', 'true', 'feelings', 'other', 'wrestlers', 'such', 'Michaels', 'Triple', 'H', 'direction', 'Federation', 'was', 'taking.Overall', 'viewing', 'definitely', 'came', 'away', 'thinking', 'Bret', 'was', 'old-school', 'traditionalist', 'struggling', 'business', 'seemed', 'be', 'changing', 'what', 'believed', 'was', 'should', 'be', 'Bret', 'interesting', 'study', 'hero', 'Canada', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'many', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'clearly', 'drew', 'strong', 'opinions', 'changing', 'sport', 'way', 'was', 'dis-loyally', 'treated', 'others', 'see', 'inflexible', 'taking', 'things', 'little', 'too', 'seriously', 'may', 'have', 'led', 'bitterness', 'viewing', 'viewer', 'can', 'draw', 'own', 'opinion', 'know', 'Bret', 'full', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'argue', 'sacrificed', 'paid', 'very', 'heavy', 'toll', 'indeed', 'sport', 'dedicated', 'life', 'would', 'add', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'very', 'redundant', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Brett', 'Hart', 'DVD', 'set', 'read', 'book', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'WWE', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'fan', 'too', '10-year', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'are', 'additional', 'updated', 'interviews', '10', 'years', 'later', 'Bret', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'documentary', 'life', 'death', 'Owen', 'Hart', 'Bret', 'younger', 'brother', 'also', 'wrestler', 'who', 'died', 'doing', 'stunt', 'pay-per-view', 'event', 'took', 'place', 'not', 'long', 'Bret', 'left', 'WWE', 'yet', 'PPV', 'event', 'continued']",N/A

Who should we believe?  Well, that really depends on you, the viewer.  I really think this is an interesting side of the WWF (now the WWE) that very few have ever seen.The movie is about the life and career of a very well known and famous wrestler, Bret Hart.  It's about his life and his struggles with the WWF.  And with Mr. McMahon, of course.  Though wrestling is scripted, THIS is not.  You also get to see the lighter side of Bret.  The family side.  You also see the toll his career takes on them.I was really in awe as I watched ""Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows.""  A very interesting documentary about the dark side of wrestling and the lives it can make....or destroy.  Highly recommend this.  Even if you don't like wrestling, you still might find this interesting.In the end, Vince says ""Bret screwed Bret.""  After seeing this, I'm not too sure about that.  Don't know what to think.

Al Taher ""Saudi_Red_Neck""","[1, 1]","Hello Friends,Now, As of this month we have been through 10 years after November 9, 1997 or infamous Montreal Screw Job.Try to find this product whether on VHS / DVD or whatever form. Why?Because :1. You will see that pro wrestling is real in many shapes and forms. Yes, it is predetermined, the moves maybe fabricated, but it truly does take a real toll on the wrestlers bodies.2. You will see what really happens backstage without sugar coating.3. You will see how the politics in wrestling play a major role in the outcome of the matches.4. You can tell that bussiness is in the dumps today because of some of the desions that Vince McMahon has made on November 9, 1997 and beyond.5. History can easlily be repeated if the current or future roster of talent is not careful.6. What you hear or see on TV may not really be the truth. IMHO opinion, Vince can do better without both HHH & Shawn Michaels.Folks, the documetary is truly a keeper, I have watched several times.I understand that Vince has the right to protect his bussiness, but he could have made a different action then Screwing Bret in his home town.How?Well, Vince was scared that Bret would take the belt to WCW (like when Alundra Blaze threw the WWF championship belt in the garbage can on TV). But, I mean come on. They could have easily like agreed bewteen Vince and Bret that the match would end with an interfernece at the end of the champsionship bout. Then Vince would take the belt from Bret before leaving the building.The next night on Raw Vince would approach the fans on RAW, and play a pre-tapped interview where Bret decides to let go of the belt for any given reason. Bret then goes to WCW (as agreed between him & Vince).But to see what Vince has done, he made it clear that no one is safe, and that he is truly selfish and truly unprofessional.I have for years enjoyed watching WWF/WWE, but after that dark day, I have lost interest. Why?Because:1. Lack of competion betwen wrestling organizations (No more WCW). Eating McDonalds can be cool, but eating it 3 times a week will make you sick.2. The roster in the WWE lacks the same charisma that we saw in the 80's & 90's.3. The storylines are boring and repetive.4. The shows rely now mostly on Divas, immorale angles and has lost the faamily values (knowing the fact that merchandise is running wild because of the children).5. Pushing related stars & and allowing them to be bookers (HHH), and burrying legends (Ric Flair).6. WWE could have dones something to minimize the huge number of deaths in pro wrestling. By at least minimizing the tour days, or at least helping create a retirment fund where an amount is deducted from their salalry on monthly basis, or having them contribute one way or another in the wrestling bussiness. Or at least being more strict on the drug testing.In the end, I hope you do enjoy the documentary, I & many friends of mine did. And the bottom line is, if you enjoy or enjoyed wrestling. And if you were or still is a Bret Hart fan, this documentary is for you !While you are at it, grab Bret Hart's autobiography, I truly enjoyed reading it.All the best,Nawaf",5,The Day that Changed Wrestling History.,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,3129,"['Hello', 'Friends', 'Now', 'month', 'have', 'been', '10', 'years', 'November', '9', '1997', 'infamous', 'Montreal', 'Screw', 'Job.Try', 'find', 'product', 'VHS', '/', 'DVD', 'form', 'Why', ':1', 'will', 'see', 'pro', 'wrestling', 'real', 'many', 'shapes', 'forms', 'Yes', 'predetermined', 'moves', 'maybe', 'fabricated', 'truly', 'take', 'real', 'toll', 'wrestlers', 'bodies.2', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'backstage', 'sugar', 'coating.3', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'politics', 'wrestling', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'outcome', 'matches.4', 'can', 'tell', 'bussiness', 'dumps', 'today', 'desions', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'made', 'November', '9', '1997', 'beyond.5', 'History', 'can', 'easlily', 'be', 'repeated', 'current', 'future', 'roster', 'talent', 'not', 'careful.6', 'What', 'hear', 'see', 'TV', 'may', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'truth', 'IMHO', 'opinion', 'Vince', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'HHH', 'Shawn', 'Michaels.Folks', 'documetary', 'truly', 'keeper', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times.I', 'understand', 'Vince', 'right', 'protect', 'bussiness', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'different', 'action', 'then', 'Screwing', 'Bret', 'home', 'town.How', 'Well', 'Vince', 'was', 'scared', 'Bret', 'would', 'take', 'belt', 'WCW', 'when', 'Alundra', 'Blaze', 'threw', 'WWF', 'championship', 'belt', 'garbage', 'can', 'TV', 'mean', 'come', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'agreed', 'bewteen', 'Vince', 'Bret', 'match', 'would', 'end', 'interfernece', 'end', 'champsionship', 'bout', 'Then', 'Vince', 'would', 'take', 'belt', 'Bret', 'leaving', 'building.The', 'next', 'night', 'Raw', 'Vince', 'would', 'approach', 'fans', 'RAW', 'play', 'pre-tapped', 'interview', 'where', 'Bret', 'let', 'go', 'belt', 'given', 'reason', 'Bret', 'then', 'WCW', 'agreed', 'Vince', '.But', 'see', 'what', 'Vince', 'done', 'made', 'clear', 'one', 'safe', 'truly', 'selfish', 'truly', 'unprofessional.I', 'have', 'years', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'WWF/WWE', 'dark', 'day', 'have', 'lost', 'interest', 'Why', 'Because:1', 'Lack', 'competion', 'betwen', 'wrestling', 'organizations', 'more', 'WCW', 'Eating', 'McDonalds', 'can', 'be', 'cool', 'eating', '3', 'times', 'week', 'will', 'make', 'sick.2', 'roster', 'WWE', 'same', 'charisma', 'saw', '80', ""90's.3"", 'storylines', 'are', 'boring', 'repetive.4', 'shows', 'rely', 'now', 'mostly', 'Divas', 'immorale', 'angles', 'lost', 'faamily', 'values', 'knowing', 'fact', 'merchandise', 'running', 'wild', 'children', '.5', 'Pushing', 'related', 'stars', 'allowing', 'be', 'bookers', 'HHH', 'burrying', 'legends', 'Ric', 'Flair', '.6', 'WWE', 'could', 'have', 'dones', 'something', 'minimize', 'huge', 'number', 'deaths', 'pro', 'wrestling', 'least', 'minimizing', 'tour', 'days', 'least', 'helping', 'create', 'retirment', 'fund', 'where', 'amount', 'deducted', 'salalry', 'monthly', 'basis', 'having', 'contribute', 'one', 'way', 'wrestling', 'bussiness', 'least', 'being', 'more', 'strict', 'drug', 'end', 'hope', 'do', 'enjoy', 'documentary', 'many', 'friends', 'mine', 'did', 'bottom', 'line', 'enjoy', 'enjoyed', 'wrestling', 'were', 'still', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'fan', 'documentary', 'are', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'autobiography', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'best', 'Nawaf']",N/A

504225,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B00000INF5,R.A. McKenzie,"[2, 2]","Documentaries and biographies are tough to recommend, because whether you like them depends on how familiar you are with the subject?  Would I have loved ""Hoop Dreams"" if I didn't grow in the western suburbs of Chicago?  Would I have loved ""Waiting For 'Superman'"" if my mother hadn't been an educator & school administrator?  Would I have loved ""An Inconvenient Truth"" if I had done my research and learned more about the environment?  Would I have loved ""Beyond The Mat"" if I wasn't a wrestling fan?""Hitman Hart: Wrestling With Shadows"" is no exception.  I am a fan of televised pro wrestling, especially the WWE (formerly known as the WWF).  I've enjoyed this kind of entertainment for as long as I can remember, and I've been fascinated with the behind-the-scenes aspect since about the time this movie since premiered in the late '90s.This documentary follows Bret Hart, the WWF's then-current champion, in last few months as he's on his way to leaving the company to work for a competing promotion.  Hart's career with the WWF has been a successful one, but like most stories from the world of entertainment, there's a darker side.  The final months with the WWF are becoming stressful and confusing.  Hart's final chapter with the company is to work with a fellow wrestler named Shawn Michaels; both men have an intense dislike for each other.Even the quiet, tender moments with the Hart Family seem to have an undercurrent of sadness.  Bret's father, Stu, was a tough-as-nails father, who trains wrestlers by applying painful holds in his ""Dungeon"".  His mother, Helen, has always hated the fact that the family is involved in the pro wrestling business, and it's been over 40 years!  And the 12 Hart children were picked on when they were kids because their father was a wrestling promoter.It's not all heartbreak, however.  In a weird way, Bret Hart seems to be having a lot of fun working with his brother and in-laws with the WWF's current script for him, even when the backstage drama gets frustrating.  His son, Blade, travels with him to the shows.  The cast of characters are unique and diverse, and seem to get along with Bret Hart pretty well.  There's a terrific part of the documentary when the WWF is coming to the Hart Family's hometown of Calgary, Canada, and the whole family gets involved with a tag team match involving 10 guys.  The crowd applauds & cheers to a fever pitch.It's difficult to explain ""Wrestling With Shadows"" because pro wrestling, unlike movies or TV, spent many years keeping the secrets & tricks away from the general audience.  The whole business thrives on a glorified con where reality is questioned?  When someone gets hurt, are they faking it?  If someone really gets hurt, do the fans even know?  When Bret Hart's final performance for the WWF ends in a confusing controversy, I've always questioned whether pro wrestling fans really understood what went down before Bret Hart and WWF owner Vince McMahon addressed the situation to the media.  I won't give away the controversial turn-of-events; diehard fans already know what happens, & newcomers deserve to see it for themselves.But will newcomers and non-fans get into ""Wrestling With Shadows""?  I personally think they will, although not for the reasons Bret Hart and director Paul Jay claim to.  The documentary began partially because they wanted to give a realistic (albeit sympathetic) look at a pro wrestler's day-to-day life.  On that level, ""Wrestling With Shadows"" works, especially because it does a good job of keeping things focused and tight.  Many wrestling documentaries tend to make references that newcomers don't understand, so it's a great relief that Paul Jay and his team didn't fall into that trap.However, when the story ends, I don't think the documentary becomes an indictment of the pro wrestling business.  Its cynical look at the business somehow erases all of the pleasant memories from one's mind.  What is the documentary trying to say?  I don't think Paul Jay really has an answer.  I know wrestling fans will get into this because this was the most fair-and-balanced document we had of went down at the Molson Centre in Montreal during Bret Hart's final perofrmance.  However, I think people unfamiliar with the WWF are going to wonder what the big deal?  Why should they care?It's my opinion that in ""Wrestling With Shadows"", Paul Jay acheived the hard part and slipped up on the easy part.  He somehow made pro wrestling understandable to the untrained viewer, much like ""Beyond The Mat"" did.  But he doesn't answer the most basic question: What's the point?  If the pro wrestling industry indeed has a dark side to it, then why should we care?  If Bret Hart's legacy with the WWF isn't a happy story, then what's the aftermath?  These are questions I feel casual viewers won't be able to answer, because ""Wrestling With Shadows"" hasn't prepared them for it.  As Bret Hart told the UK Sun in 2009, the filmmakers approached him and said, ""We don't have an ending.""  Seriously, think about ""Wrestling With Shadows"" without its final act; I'm betting the movie was conceptualized one way, but when the filmmakers caught a shocking different ending on tape, Paul Jay was then forced to merge the two together.That's just my theory, anywayI'm giving this 5 stars because I'm familiar with pro wrestling, and I think fans will absolutely love this!  However, this is a 4-star recommendation from me, because I think director Paul Jay could've done more to wrap it up.The bonus disc features ""The Life and Death of Owen Hart"", another documentary from Paul Jay.  In all fairness, it's not very well put together, but I enjoyed it anyway.  4 stars for fans, 3 stars for the rest.",5,Wrestling Fans Will Love It.

Bret Hart &amp; Paul Jay took the viewers into the most private moments of Hart's life in the WWF. The video showed the viewers how Bret cared about his wrestling career, his devotion to his chosen profession, his love for his family, his opinions about certain people in the WWF, his observation on how wrestling has changed over the years, &amp; his relationship with WWF owner Vince McMahon, who stabbed Bret in the back after Bret gave 14 years of his life working for the WWF.During the making of this video, Bret just signed a deal with McMahon for less money but a 20 year contract with the WWF. He could've gone to WCW for more money, but Bret felt a sense of loyalty to the WWF &amp; Vince McMahon &amp; opted to stay in the WWF. While this was going on, WCW was beating the WWF in the ratings. Vince later told Bret that he can't afford him anymore &amp; wanted him out of his deal. Bret reluctantly agreed because he didn't want to leave the federation he has called home for 14 years. Then, on his last match for the WWF before leaving for rival promotion WCW...I can't recommend this film enough.

Of course we were like 8 and not 27 at the time, so watching wrestling was truly normal for the age group. Outside of the Ultimate warrior nobody rammed the world like Brett ""The Hitman"" Hart did. We often thought ""man if we could get our hands on those fantastic pink robocop sunglasses, we'd be the coolest kids on the planet."" Well unfortunately the shades never worked out and either did the old boy Brett's career with the WWF. From the viewers standpoint it seemed to be the usual aging wrestler gracefully making his way out the back door. However after watching Wrestling with Shadows it was a totally different story. One that made you say to McMahon...I want to hit you, I want to hit you soooo bad!As we stated in the previous paragraph Wrestling With Shadows explains exactly what happened to the Hitman's career. What started off as a situation where Sid said ""wouldn't it be hilarious to watch this Hitman movies?"" turned into an absolutely intriguing documentary. You really get to explore the studio space of the Hart family and in some odd way begin to legitimately like them. It documents Hart's 14 year career with the WWF from his moments as master of the house up to his sudden demise thanks to the crooked ways of Vince McMahon. The only thing good this wanna be meat head ever did was supply this planet with a daughter sporting a glorious rack. At least Brett smashed his face in, off camera, after the ultimate betrayal. It was somewhat similar to Vach's hand fork stabbing on Mr. Cross...yeah it was that satisfying.Without a doubt Sid gives a full seal of approval for Hitman Hart: I want to wrestle you so freaking bad. It's the finest cinema to come out of Canada next to The Final Sacrifice. We even think we saw Rowsdower sitting front row at one of Brett's 1980's wrestling matches, or maybe it was some other drunk bloated hick. All we were expecting was to get a nice 90's B documentary under our belt, and wound up glued to the screen watching a true masterpiece. Sure Brett never dropped a coontz throughout the film but still managed to headlock us into a 5 star review. If you're a wrestling fanatic then you probably all ready own 4 copies of this on VHS, laserdisk, DVD, & bluray. But for the rest of the normal functioning world we implore you to watch this when you get a chance.

Building on his father's success in the ring, Bret became one of the most-recognizable faces during the 1990s wrestling boom. Wrestling in the Shadows is a documentary that follows Hart during his split from Vince McMahon's WWF for a rival league.There is a lot to like in this documentary. Hart discusses what it was like to have a father who was a pro wrestler. By Bret's reckoning, it was mostly negative, as it led to much abuse from other children. Also, the viewer learns about Bret's life with his wife and kids and about the difficulties of life on the road.However, the main focus is on Hart's deteriorating relationship with Vince McMahon. Hart admits that McMahon's help was essential to his success in wrestling, but Hart fears that McMahon will take away Hart's championship belt before he leaves. The drama builds as the documentary nears its end.My only complaint with the film is that we don't know how much of the action is scripted. Given that Hart eventually returned to work for McMahon, I believe that much of what happens in the film is staged.Still, I enjoyed the film held my interest.

I had watched like many and VHS recorded the original airing of Wrestling With Shadows on A & E when it was doubled up with the Hulk Hogan biography. This was a highly anticipated film which was done with respect and great quality to both Bret Hart and WWE. At the time Vince McMahon didn't want the world to know what the inside story was on Bret getting out of WWE to go to WCW at that time. This documentary serves as a snip-it of one of many situations a wrestler goes through when working for a major organization. It's more than the physical product you see every week. There's the mental preparation, sometimes the walk through of a match/angle, and then like in any other line of work there's contract negotiation issues. This also tells the story of Bret Hart, which is complimented some 10 years later by the WWE released anthology of Bret Hart and the book titled Hitman: My Life In The Cartoon World of Wrestling. It will also be revisited in the soon to be released title by WWE outlining the Montreal incident.The DVD on Owen Hart wasn't as lengthy as Bret's Wrestling with Shadows. But it gave a fair look into who Owen Hart was with insight from various people within his life. Owen's DVD focuses mostly on his tragic accident from 1999 that costed him his life, and forced his family to be without a father.
