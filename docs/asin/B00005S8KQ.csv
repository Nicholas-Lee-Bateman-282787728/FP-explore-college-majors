681153,A3VDGERHHLOQVQ,B00005S8KQ,Crabby Apple Mick Lee,"[8, 9]","I remember watching this movie when I was a only seven or eight and being totally ticked off that most of the film was set away from all the action I loved.  ""Hey, we're fighting the Germans.  Forget this French chick!""Now watching this film all these years later I am nearly overwhelmed with how mature and complex Kings Go Forth is.  This could have easily sunk to the level of a simple minded morality play; but the interplay of likable and flawed human characters raise this film to be a story for thoughtful adults.Racism is a theme; but it is only one of several.  We have a rich kid/poor kid dynamic.  We have sexual jeolousy.  We have a central character who struggles to not only to do the right thing but to act with a nobility he knows is not natural for him.  We have a irresponsible character who is sauve and socially graceful who knows exactly what he is even though he is a true hero in many ways.  We have a French girl who is actually American--very much American in the sense that she is the product of a uniquely American melting pot.  But she lives in exile because she is also ahead of her time.  She so desparately wants to be worthy of her true homeland and is crushed when she finds out the hope she has set her heart on is false.  She also knows that she failed to ""dance with the one who brought her"" for a golden boy whose promise was untrue.On top of all this is the larger drama of loyalty and duty in war.  How at the end Sinatra comforts and forgives the buddy he promised to kill as death seemingly was about to consume them both.  Deaths both Sinatra and Curtis come to accept as a price of the mission.Sinatra was rarely better than this.  Wood breathes live into a role that is quite wooden on paper.  While Curtis acts his butt off playing the cad we end up feeling sympathy for.  (It has been Tony Curtis' great fortune and curse to be in films where he is overshadowed by actors who were not just good but great.  We are dazzled by the performances of these great actors so much that Curtis' own contributions are obscured by the glow.  But he also has to be ranked as one of Hollywood's most accomplished and skilled actors.)Kings Go Forth is an excellent film.  It is overlooked and deserves more.  It is both complex and subtle.

I asked myself that after watching the trailer for KINGS GO FORTH.  It's the price I pay for watching the trailers before the movie.  Figure they'll give me a hint about what the movie's makers wanted us to think about the movie, give me a clue about their motives.There were a bunch of reasons for popping the dvd out of the player then and there.  KINGS GO FORTH was directed by Delmer Daves, who was in free-fall career decline in 1958, the year the movie was released.  One of the factors contributing to the decline was his growing tendency to be late to the game on the big trends - KGF is about a forbidden love, and it's forbidden because the woman involved had a black father.  If this had been made a decade earlier, back when movies like `Gentleman's Agreement,' `Pinky,' and `Cross-Fire' were breaking the ground on racial prejudice it would be different.  By '58 it was a relatively safe topic, and, fair or not, that makes a big difference.Also adding to the `you don't want to watch this' feeling was the cast. You can argue, and probably convince me, that Frank Sinatra was the greatest singer ever pressed on vinyl.  Different story when you talk about his acting, though.  Great in `From Here To Eternity,' intolerable in `Tony Rome.' Sinatra's two co-stars, Natalie Wood and Tony Curtis, weren't any more promising.  Worst of all the movie took its title from the Bible.  As a general rule movies that take their names from the Bible take themselves very seriously, and want their audience to do the same. So you've got a `hot' topic that was topical a decade earlier, a sense of righteousness that usually makes social-conscious movies a drag, and a trio of less than sure-fire stars.With all that stacked against it, I'm happy to say I thought this movie was okay.  Sinatra is in Maggio mode here, the odd-man out in a love triangle he shares with Wood and Curtis.  Sinatra and Curtis are in the same army unit in the picturesque south of France, fighting the Germans during the week, pitching woo at Wood during the weekend. The last act resolves a crisis in the love triangle and introduces a plan by Lt. Sinatra to break the stalemate between the U.S. and German forces, both of which are groaningly predictable.  Wood's character is a little too perfect, a little too saintly and innocent to be convincing, but she does the best that could be expected with the role.  Curtis, as the charming rogue who cuts in on and supplants Sinatra, is okay. KINGS GO FORTH isn't quite as daring a statement it believes itself to be, but it's solid enough entertainment.",3,Alright story of 'forbidden' love,1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,2657,"['Do', 'REALLY', 'want', 'watch', 'most', 'challenging', 'love', 'story', 'time', 'asked', 'watching', 'trailer', 'KINGS', 'GO', 'FORTH', 'price', 'pay', 'watching', 'trailers', 'movie', 'Figure', ""'ll"", 'give', 'hint', 'what', 'movie', 'makers', 'wanted', 'think', 'movie', 'give', 'clue', 'motives.There', 'were', 'bunch', 'reasons', 'popping', 'dvd', 'player', 'then', 'there', 'KINGS', 'GO', 'FORTH', 'was', 'directed', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'who', 'was', 'free-fall', 'career', 'decline', '1958', 'year', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'One', 'factors', 'contributing', 'decline', 'was', 'growing', 'tendency', 'be', 'late', 'game', 'big', 'trends', 'KGF', 'forbidden', 'love', 'forbidden', 'woman', 'involved', 'had', 'black', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'decade', 'earlier', 'back', 'when', 'movies', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'Pinky', 'Cross-Fire', 'were', 'breaking', 'ground', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'would', 'be', 'different', ""'58"", 'was', 'relatively', 'safe', 'topic', 'not', 'big', 'difference.Also', 'adding', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'feeling', 'was', 'cast', 'can', 'argue', 'probably', 'convince', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'was', 'greatest', 'singer', 'ever', 'pressed', 'vinyl', 'Different', 'story', 'when', 'talk', 'acting', 'though', 'Great', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'intolerable', 'Tony', 'Rome', 'Sinatra', 'two', 'co-stars', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'were', ""n't"", 'more', 'promising', 'Worst', 'movie', 'took', 'title', 'Bible', 'general', 'rule', 'movies', 'take', 'names', 'Bible', 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'want', 'audience', 'do', 'same', ""'ve"", 'got', 'hot', 'topic', 'was', 'topical', 'decade', 'earlier', 'sense', 'righteousness', 'usually', 'social-conscious', 'movies', 'drag', 'trio', 'less', 'sure-fire', 'stars.With', 'stacked', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'okay', 'Sinatra', 'Maggio', 'mode', 'here', 'odd-man', 'out', 'love', 'triangle', 'shares', 'Wood', 'Curtis', 'Sinatra', 'Curtis', 'are', 'same', 'army', 'unit', 'picturesque', 'south', 'France', 'fighting', 'Germans', 'week', 'pitching', 'woo', 'Wood', 'weekend', 'last', 'act', 'crisis', 'love', 'triangle', 'plan', 'Lt.', 'Sinatra', 'break', 'stalemate', 'U.S.', 'German', 'forces', 'are', 'groaningly', 'predictable', 'Wood', 'character', 'little', 'too', 'perfect', 'little', 'too', 'saintly', 'innocent', 'be', 'convincing', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'role', 'Curtis', 'charming', 'rogue', 'who', 'supplants', 'Sinatra', 'okay', 'KINGS', 'GO', 'FORTH', ""n't"", 'quite', 'daring', 'statement', 'be', 'solid', 'enough', 'entertainment']",N/A
