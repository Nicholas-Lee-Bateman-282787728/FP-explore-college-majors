Century, about the carpenter, John Harrison (Michael Gambon), who believe that a clock impervious to extremes of temperature and the motion of a ship at sea will solve the problem of determining longitude.The second, set in the early 20th century, tells of the trials and tribulations of Cdr.Rupert Gould (Jeremy Irons),""on leave"" from the Royal Navy, in finding and restoring Harrisons' 4 clocks.It was common knowledge, even in the 18th. Century, that the Earth turns through 1 every 3 minutes 56 seconds. If every 3'56"" unit of time = 1 of Longitude then all mariners need is some arbitrary Prime Meridian to compare with ship's time at noon! i.e. Greenwich. Through the Act of Queen Anne, Parliament offered a prize of 20,000, to anyone who could find a practical way to find longitude at sea.To Harrison that meant a clock that could keep time at sea and so he  presented the ad hoc Board of Longitude with the world's first chronometer. He was opposed by the ""lunatics"" on the board, personified by the obese Dr. Bliss (Ian McNeice) and rodent like Rev. Nevil Maskelyne (Samuel West,)astromomers who insisted that ""lunar observations, properly charted, would solve the problem of navigation at sea"" even though the moon could not be seen for 12 days in every month.Gould was a British Officer in ""disgrace for conduct un-becoming;"" a nervous breakdown no less ~ whilst on active duty at sea in World War I. In the early 20th. Century it seems, Post-traumatic Stress disorder was no excuse for a British Officer and Gentleman  to ""fail in setting an example to the British Other Ranks."" Gould had further ""blotted his copy-book"" by seperation from his wife Muriel (Anna Chancellor) who found the strain from his ""obsession"" with restoring Harrison's clocks unbearable.After a roller-coaster ride of triumph and setbacks, the stories come together at the Greenwich Obseratory where Harrison's four clocks, restored by Gould and his journals on their restoration, are on joint display.Harrison was given his 20,000 at the age of 80 by special act of Parliament and had 2 years to enjoy his wealth before his death on March 24, 1776. Gould was given a gold medal in 1946 and often appeared on the ""The Brain's Trust"" until his death 5 October 1948.This two disc version of ""Longitude"" includes a useful docco that clarifies the Board's resistance to Harrison's ""machanical"" solution to finding longitude at sea: the board members, university educated astronomers, were deeply incensed by the prospect of handing over the 20,000 prize to a country tool-maker and not a man of science!For me the great irony of ""Longitude"" lay in the clockmaker George Graham's(Peter Vaughan) warning to Harrison, that ""the Board wants a practical solution - they won't reward a theory,"" because in their grim determination to ignore Harrison, in favor of luna observations the likes of Bliss and Maskelyne spent 40 years trying to do JUST THAT!A quotation from elsewhere:""In the excellent film ""Longitude"" Rupert Gould is seen on the TV version of ""The Brains Trust,"" but the show was not televised until 4 September 1955; seven years after his death. The radio version of ""The Brains' Trust"" had it's first transmission on 1 January 1941.""Still both Harrison and Gould stuck to their guns and won out in the end and that makes it more than just a docco to me.",5,The man who made his bicycle fly to France,1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,3575,"['Longitude', 'view', 'docco-drama', 'best', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'utterly', 'boring', 'lesser', 'hands', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Jeremy', 'Irons.Longitude', 'actually', 'two', 'stories', 'set', '200', 'years', 'apart', 'first', 'set', '18th', 'Century', 'carpenter', 'John', 'Harrison', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'who', 'believe', 'clock', 'impervious', 'extremes', 'temperature', 'motion', 'ship', 'sea', 'will', 'solve', 'problem', 'determining', 'longitude.The', 'second', 'set', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'tells', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Cdr.Rupert', 'Gould', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'leave', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'finding', 'restoring', 'Harrisons', '4', 'clocks.It', 'was', 'common', 'knowledge', 'even', '18th', 'Century', 'Earth', '1', '3', 'minutes', '56', 'seconds', ""3'56"", 'unit', 'time', '=', '1', 'Longitude', 'then', 'mariners', 'need', 'arbitrary', 'Prime', 'Meridian', 'compare', 'ship', 'time', 'noon', 'i.e', 'Greenwich', 'Act', 'Queen', 'Anne', 'Parliament', 'offered', 'prize', '20,000', 'anyone', 'who', 'could', 'find', 'practical', 'way', 'find', 'longitude', 'sea.To', 'Harrison', 'meant', 'clock', 'could', 'keep', 'time', 'sea', 'so', 'presented', 'ad', 'hoc', 'Board', 'Longitude', 'world', 'first', 'chronometer', 'was', 'opposed', 'lunatics', 'board', 'personified', 'obese', 'Dr.', 'Bliss', 'Ian', 'McNeice', 'rodent', 'Rev', 'Nevil', 'Maskelyne', 'Samuel', 'West', 'astromomers', 'who', 'insisted', 'lunar', 'observations', 'properly', 'charted', 'would', 'solve', 'problem', 'navigation', 'sea', 'even', 'moon', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'seen', '12', 'days', 'month.Gould', 'was', 'British', 'Officer', 'disgrace', 'conduct', 'un-becoming', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'less', '~', 'whilst', 'active', 'duty', 'sea', 'World', 'War', 'early', '20th', 'Century', 'Post-traumatic', 'Stress', 'disorder', 'was', 'excuse', 'British', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'fail', 'setting', 'example', 'British', 'Other', 'Ranks', 'Gould', 'had', 'further', 'blotted', 'copy-book', 'seperation', 'wife', 'Muriel', 'Anna', 'Chancellor', 'who', 'found', 'strain', 'obsession', 'restoring', 'Harrison', 'clocks', 'unbearable.After', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'triumph', 'setbacks', 'stories', 'come', 'together', 'Greenwich', 'Obseratory', 'where', 'Harrison', 'four', 'clocks', 'restored', 'Gould', 'journals', 'restoration', 'are', 'joint', 'display.Harrison', 'was', 'given', '20,000', 'age', '80', 'special', 'act', 'Parliament', 'had', '2', 'years', 'enjoy', 'wealth', 'death', 'March', '24', '1776', 'Gould', 'was', 'given', 'gold', 'medal', '1946', 'often', 'appeared', 'Brain', 'Trust', 'death', '5', 'October', '1948.This', 'two', 'disc', 'version', 'Longitude', 'useful', 'docco', 'Board', 'resistance', 'Harrison', 'machanical', 'solution', 'finding', 'longitude', 'sea', 'board', 'members', 'university', 'educated', 'astronomers', 'were', 'deeply', 'incensed', 'prospect', 'handing', '20,000', 'prize', 'country', 'tool-maker', 'not', 'man', 'science', 'great', 'irony', 'Longitude', 'lay', 'clockmaker', 'George', 'Graham', 'Peter', 'Vaughan', 'warning', 'Harrison', 'Board', 'practical', 'solution', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reward', 'theory', 'grim', 'determination', 'ignore', 'Harrison', 'favor', 'luna', 'observations', 'likes', 'Bliss', 'Maskelyne', 'spent', '40', 'years', 'trying', 'do', 'JUST', 'THAT', 'quotation', 'elsewhere', 'excellent', 'film', 'Longitude', 'Rupert', 'Gould', 'seen', 'TV', 'version', 'Brains', 'Trust', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'televised', '4', 'September', '1955', 'seven', 'years', 'death', 'radio', 'version', 'Brains', 'Trust', 'had', 'first', 'transmission', '1', 'January', '1941', 'Still', 'Harrison', 'Gould', 'stuck', 'guns', 'won', 'out', 'end', 'more', 'just', 'docco']",N/A
551546,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B00004U2K1,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[1, 1]","This compelling historical drama based on Dava Sobel's bestseller, tells the story of how one lonely genius solved the problem of how sailors could locate their position at sea. Until 18th-century clockmaker John Harrison (Michael Gambon) came on the scene, sailors could calculate what their latitude was but had no way of knowing their longitude. This meant they were constantly running into hazards with great loss of life. To solve the problem, the British Parliament set up a Longitude Board and offered a reward of 20,000 pounds -- an unimaginable fortune for that time -- to the man who came up with a practical solution.There were two approaches to the problem. The first, favored by the scientific elite of the time, depended on using celestial observation to make the calculation. The problem was that the math was very complex -- and that if the skies were not clear, there was no way to take the required measurements. Despite these obvious difficulties, the gentlemen-scientists of the day proved extraordinary stubborn, refusing to abandon an approach that could never work.Anderson, a bluff, working-class Yorkshireman and amazing craftsman, came up with the other approach -- which was simply to build a timepiece that kept accurate time in all extremes of temperature and weather. Anderson build four amazing clocks, each more accurate than the last. The first was a beautiful but cumbersome timepiece. The last was simply an enlarged pocket watch that could be easily transported and protected -- and which was uncannily accurate.But the Longitude Board, in charge of deciding whether the problem had been solved and giving Anderson the prize he had earned, put one obstacle after another into his path. Their unwillingness to recognize his solution (that of a tradesman rather than a scientist) was based on acute, English class consciousness, otherwise known as snobbery of the worst kind.This series mixes Anderson's tale with that of shell-shocked British Navy veteran Rupert Gould (Jeremy Irons)who in the 1930s devoted himself to restoring Anderson's beautiful creations to working order. I must say I found this part of the story much less compelling. It slowed down the really interesting stuff -- as Anderson's quest for recognition and justice reached a climax.The 1930s scenes mar this movie -- but not too seriously. They slow it down and freight it with unneeded and unwanted mawkishness. But the original 18th century story is fascinating -- I would say riveting. Gambon is excellent as always and the rest of the cast equally fine.",4,Excellent historical drama,1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,2564,"['compelling', 'historical', 'drama', 'based', 'Dava', 'Sobel', 'bestseller', 'story', 'how', 'one', 'lonely', 'genius', 'solved', 'problem', 'how', 'sailors', 'could', 'locate', 'position', 'sea', '18th-century', 'clockmaker', 'John', 'Harrison', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'came', 'scene', 'sailors', 'could', 'calculate', 'what', 'latitude', 'was', 'had', 'way', 'knowing', 'longitude', 'meant', 'were', 'constantly', 'running', 'hazards', 'great', 'loss', 'life', 'solve', 'problem', 'British', 'Parliament', 'set', 'up', 'Longitude', 'Board', 'offered', 'reward', '20,000', 'pounds', 'unimaginable', 'fortune', 'time', 'man', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'practical', 'solution.There', 'were', 'two', 'approaches', 'problem', 'first', 'favored', 'scientific', 'elite', 'time', 'depended', 'using', 'celestial', 'observation', 'make', 'calculation', 'problem', 'was', 'math', 'was', 'very', 'complex', 'skies', 'were', 'not', 'clear', 'was', 'way', 'take', 'required', 'measurements', 'obvious', 'difficulties', 'gentlemen-scientists', 'day', 'proved', 'extraordinary', 'stubborn', 'refusing', 'abandon', 'approach', 'could', 'never', 'work.Anderson', 'bluff', 'working-class', 'Yorkshireman', 'amazing', 'craftsman', 'came', 'up', 'other', 'approach', 'was', 'simply', 'build', 'timepiece', 'kept', 'accurate', 'time', 'extremes', 'temperature', 'weather', 'Anderson', 'build', 'four', 'amazing', 'clocks', 'more', 'accurate', 'last', 'first', 'was', 'beautiful', 'cumbersome', 'timepiece', 'last', 'was', 'simply', 'enlarged', 'pocket', 'watch', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'transported', 'protected', 'was', 'uncannily', 'Longitude', 'Board', 'charge', 'deciding', 'problem', 'had', 'been', 'solved', 'giving', 'Anderson', 'prize', 'had', 'earned', 'put', 'one', 'obstacle', 'path', 'unwillingness', 'recognize', 'solution', 'tradesman', 'rather', 'scientist', 'was', 'based', 'acute', 'English', 'class', 'consciousness', 'otherwise', 'known', 'snobbery', 'worst', 'kind.This', 'series', 'mixes', 'Anderson', 'tale', 'shell-shocked', 'British', 'Navy', 'veteran', 'Rupert', 'Gould', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'who', '1930s', 'devoted', 'restoring', 'Anderson', 'beautiful', 'creations', 'working', 'order', 'must', 'say', 'found', 'part', 'story', 'much', 'less', 'compelling', 'slowed', 'down', 'really', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'Anderson', 'quest', 'recognition', 'justice', 'reached', 'climax.The', '1930s', 'scenes', 'mar', 'movie', 'not', 'too', 'seriously', 'slow', 'down', 'freight', 'unneeded', 'unwanted', 'mawkishness', 'original', '18th', 'century', 'story', 'fascinating', 'would', 'say', 'riveting', 'Gambon', 'excellent', 'always', 'rest', 'cast', 'equally', 'fine']",N/A

551551,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,B00004U2K1,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[123, 125]","This film is described as an adaptation of Dava Sobel's book of the same name. It is far more than an adaptation, however. Charles Sturridge took a somewhat threadbare tale and turned it into a stirring, dramatic account of the life, tribulations, and ultimate achievement of the 18th century English horologist, John Harrison. It's not that Sobel's book is poorly written. It is in fact entertaining and engrossing as far as it goes. The trouble is that she doesn't go into enough detail and leaves a lot of questions unanswered for the reader. Sturridge takes up her story and fleshes it out, providing the sort of background and character development that the book lacks. Providing the audience with a parallel storyline involving the WWI veteran, Rupert Gould (briefly noted in Sobel's book) also is a stroke of genius on the writer/director's part. The parallels between the lives of the earlier inventor and the shell-shocked vet are striking and poignant.It does nothing to hurt Sturridge's cause to have assembled such a sterling British cast. Irons and Gambon have great roles to their credit, but they surpass themselves in this production. Sturridge has demonstrated that he can squeeze good acting out of a virtual lemon (Ted Danson in Sturridge's adaptation of ""Gulliver's Travels""). He has far more to work with here, and the results are remarkable. Gambon, perhaps best known to American audiences for his lead role in ""The Singing Detective,"" and the recent ""Gosford Park,"" again delivers the goods in this masterful performance. He captures perfectly his character's idiosyncrasies, vicissitudes and ultimate triumph.Much of the series of course focuses on the ""chase"" for a solution to the longitude problem that plagued seamen from time immemorial. Methods for determining longitude before the chronometer was invented ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous. Heavenly charts were sometimes supplanted by such ludicrous schemes as ""the wounded dog method&quot;. The following is a transcription of a dialogue delivered by the method`s inventor:"" Now, it is vital to my process, Sir Edmund, that each dog be wounded with the *same knife*, as these three animals have been, under my instructions, some three days ago. Now, the animals are then to be conveyed aboard one of His Majesty's ships, uh, under the supervision of a designated officer, whose task it is to *prevent the wound from healing*. Now the knife, however, would remain here, in London, and at *precisely noon*, each day, is to be plunged into the Powder of Sympathy, which would immediately aggravate the wound, so that each dog, no matter how many thousands of miles away he may be on his particular vessel, would begin to howl... thus.""Clearly, there was a need for a practical solution to this age-old problem, as thousands of sailors were placed in constant peril, owing to the fact that, without a reliable method, they really couldn't get their bearings. This is one area where Sobel does a very good job in her book describing the difficulty in determining longitude, versus the rather simple methods for calculating latitude. That a rather simple man of humble origins could work out the method was disconcerting to several members of the vaunted Board of Longitude, which was composed of members of the ruling class. Harrison's chief detractor and a rival for his claim of the longitude prize (20,000 pounds, equivalent to almost a million dollars by today's standards) was Sir Nevil Maskelyne. Maskelyne comes across in the film and in Sobel's book as a rather arrogant, self-inflated snob, who engages in actual subterfuge of Harrison's claims. Viewers/readers may be interested to note that Maskelyne also appears as a character in Thomas Pynchon's ""Mason &amp; Dixon,"" also in an unflattering light.In terms of a recommendation, I would have to give Sobel's book between three and four stars. While it is highly readable and engaging, it leaves way too many avenues and dramatic possibilities unexplored. Sturridge fills in all the gaps, and then some. It is not often that I recommend a film over a book, but in this instance, the film is a far richer and satisfying experience.",5,Better Than the Book,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,4178,"['film', 'described', 'adaptation', 'Dava', 'Sobel', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'far', 'more', 'adaptation', 'however', 'Charles', 'Sturridge', 'took', 'somewhat', 'threadbare', 'tale', 'turned', 'stirring', 'dramatic', 'account', 'life', 'tribulations', 'ultimate', 'achievement', '18th', 'century', 'English', 'horologist', 'John', 'Harrison', 'not', 'Sobel', 'book', 'poorly', 'written', 'fact', 'entertaining', 'engrossing', 'as', 'far', 'trouble', ""n't"", 'go', 'enough', 'detail', 'lot', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'reader', 'Sturridge', 'up', 'story', 'fleshes', 'out', 'providing', 'sort', 'background', 'character', 'development', 'book', 'Providing', 'audience', 'parallel', 'storyline', 'involving', 'WWI', 'veteran', 'Rupert', 'Gould', 'briefly', 'noted', 'Sobel', 'book', 'also', 'stroke', 'genius', 'writer/director', 'part', 'parallels', 'lives', 'earlier', 'inventor', 'shell-shocked', 'vet', 'are', 'striking', 'poignant.It', 'nothing', 'hurt', 'Sturridge', 'cause', 'have', 'assembled', 'sterling', 'British', 'cast', 'Irons', 'Gambon', 'have', 'great', 'roles', 'credit', 'surpass', 'production', 'Sturridge', 'demonstrated', 'can', 'squeeze', 'good', 'acting', 'virtual', 'lemon', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Sturridge', 'adaptation', 'Gulliver', 'Travels', 'far', 'more', 'work', 'here', 'results', 'are', 'remarkable', 'Gambon', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'American', 'audiences', 'lead', 'role', 'Singing', 'Detective', 'recent', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'again', 'goods', 'masterful', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'character', 'idiosyncrasies', 'vicissitudes', 'ultimate', 'triumph.Much', 'series', 'course', 'focuses', 'chase', 'solution', 'longitude', 'problem', 'plagued', 'seamen', 'time', 'immemorial', 'Methods', 'determining', 'longitude', 'chronometer', 'was', 'invented', 'ranged', 'sublime', 'ridiculous', 'Heavenly', 'charts', 'were', 'sometimes', 'supplanted', 'such', 'ludicrous', 'schemes', 'wounded', 'dog', 'method', 'quot', 'following', 'transcription', 'dialogue', 'delivered', 'method', 's', 'inventor', 'Now', 'vital', 'process', 'Sir', 'Edmund', 'dog', 'be', 'wounded', '*same', 'knife*', 'three', 'animals', 'have', 'been', 'instructions', 'three', 'days', 'ago', 'Now', 'animals', 'are', 'then', 'be', 'conveyed', 'one', 'Majesty', 'ships', 'uh', 'supervision', 'designated', 'officer', 'task', '*prevent', 'wound', 'healing*', 'Now', 'knife', 'however', 'would', 'remain', 'here', 'London', '*precisely', 'noon*', 'day', 'be', 'plunged', 'Powder', 'Sympathy', 'would', 'immediately', 'aggravate', 'wound', 'dog', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'thousands', 'miles', 'away', 'may', 'be', 'particular', 'vessel', 'would', 'begin', 'howl', 'thus', 'Clearly', 'was', 'need', 'practical', 'solution', 'age-old', 'problem', 'thousands', 'sailors', 'were', 'placed', 'constant', 'peril', 'owing', 'fact', 'reliable', 'method', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'bearings', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'Sobel', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'book', 'describing', 'difficulty', 'determining', 'longitude', 'rather', 'simple', 'methods', 'calculating', 'latitude', 'rather', 'simple', 'man', 'humble', 'origins', 'could', 'work', 'out', 'method', 'was', 'disconcerting', 'several', 'members', 'vaunted', 'Board', 'Longitude', 'was', 'composed', 'members', 'ruling', 'class', 'Harrison', 'chief', 'detractor', 'rival', 'claim', 'longitude', 'prize', '20,000', 'pounds', 'equivalent', 'almost', 'million', 'dollars', 'today', 'standards', 'was', 'Sir', 'Nevil', 'Maskelyne', 'Maskelyne', 'film', 'Sobel', 'book', 'rather', 'arrogant', 'self-inflated', 'snob', 'who', 'actual', 'subterfuge', 'Harrison', 'claims', 'Viewers/readers', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'note', 'Maskelyne', 'also', 'character', 'Thomas', 'Pynchon', 'Mason', 'amp', 'Dixon', 'also', 'unflattering', 'light.In', 'terms', 'recommendation', 'would', 'have', 'give', 'Sobel', 'book', 'three', 'four', 'stars', 'highly', 'readable', 'engaging', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'avenues', 'dramatic', 'possibilities', 'unexplored', 'Sturridge', 'fills', 'gaps', 'then', 'not', 'often', 'recommend', 'film', 'book', 'instance', 'film', 'far', 'richer', 'satisfying', 'experience']",N/A

This book well dramatizes the Sobel book, but interspersed with the story of how John Harrison found a useful and practical means of finding longitude at sea, is the story of Rupert Gould (well acted by Jeremy Irons), who overcame shell shock, mental illness, and a failing marriage to restore Harrison's chronometers.Perhaps the major problem is that the stories do not mesh that well.  The transitions seemed rather forced, and the effort to make the stories parallel (with Gould working on, say, the second chronometer as the Harrisons are building it) don't work to the benefit of either story.  The idea seems to be to expand what isn't a terribly long book into a miniseries.  Good idea, not so good in execution.  The Harrisons have by far the more interesting story, and I suspect that most people (readers of the book, for example) wanted to see their story, not that of Gould.Well set and directed, with the sea scenes especially well done (though why it was necessary to follow convention and have a flogging scene, I don't know, though that seems to be part of any sea story these days).Michael Gambon is notable as John Harrison, playing him well both as a young man and as an elderly one.

For ""film as history lesson"" it stays sharply on course with the known history of its subject, it is full of high sea adventure, heartbreak, fascinating glimpses into 18th century technology and the mindsets that produced it and much, much more.The stories of John Harrison and Rupert Gould, one's creating and the other's discovery - are played out on the screen simultaneously in an ingenious time traveling manner that is never confusing but keeps the viewer alert and hungry with anticipation.  Its 200+ minutes fly by too quickly.Harrison is played with such crackling authority, gusto and love by Michael Gambon that it is impossible not to route for him and be angered at the shabby treatment he receives at the hands of the Board of Longitude- really little more than an aristocratic old boys club unwilling to accept that a country carpenter could possibly solve the problem of longitude at sea.  These bastards held up Harrison for over half a century, refusing to fully acknowledge his achievement and withholding the prize from him for some 51 years!  Harrison's dream of providing a better life for William, his son, is lost in the balance as his son dedicates his 40 some years to aiding his father.  As William, Ian Hart must play a lot of second fiddle, but in his important scenes he adds further heart to the story and his speech to his father about earning respect and love is one of the film's most powerful.As Gould Jeremy Irons is - as always - terrific, putting more gas into the role than anyone else may have thought to, and watching the dissolution of his marriage, sanity and life, all mirroring various points of Harrison's life, is never less than fascinating.I can't find enough good things to say about this wonderful, gripping movie.

It would be another eleven years before I had a chance to finally purchase the mini-series at a reasonable cost. Until fairly recently it wasn't available for less than $30. Not sure what caused the price reduction, but for $4, it was finally time to catch up.I'm not disappointed, but after a decade of imagining what this was like... I suppose I had built-up too much anticipation for what turned out to be a decent film series. Nothing like the awesome centuries spanning mystery and adventure that my mind had conjured over the years.This production reminds me a bit of the recent film ""Julie & Julia"" where many reviewers, like myself, felt the Julia Child story was absolutely wonderful and the Julie Powell story was only a middling affair that acted as a distraction.And like that - so it seems is Longitude. A dual story of two men who lived nearly two hundred years apart, but shared a similar goal - to bring the pure order of Time into our lives that, without it, is chaotic and unmanageable.As these are biographical films - I was engaged to learn the story of these two disparate men. One lost to the passage of time (no pun intended), a carpenter who literally changed the face of the world: John Harrison as portrayed by consummate British actor Michael Gambon. The other: Rupert Gould, a British naval officer who, some two hundred years later, rediscovered Harrison's amazing handcrafted timepieces rusting away; neglected by the very people and service that benefitted by their creation.While Jeremy Irons' character and story is serviceable - I found the constant cutting between the two worlds, present and the past, distracting. It seems to me that Longitude would've been better off as two productions, one solely dedicated to the incredible struggle of John Harrison, and the other about Gould's quest to recover his creations. Bookends to the same story, rather than a melang&eacute; of the two.Honestly, the suggested parallels between the lives of these two men - and the reason the director/writers executed the films this way - was a stretch during many points in the series.Case in point: Harrison's wife was a steadfast, if not a wholehearted, supporter of her husband during all those decades of struggle. While Gould's wife left him almost immediately upon his announcement to recover the other timepieces. Hardly mirror images.That complaint aside - I enjoyed the mini-series. Had no idea what it took to bring, what eventually became the marine chronometer, into existence. And I finally understand why Greenwich, England is considered the Prime Meridian across the globe.

Finding your east-west longitude however (and keeping your ship off the reefs) was hit-and-miss. That could get you killed. The cure was to know the time in London, precisely, but keeping time accurate on a rolling ship was tougher than keeping milk fresh; pendulum clocks need stable ground, and pendulum clocks were all they had.Queen Anne had another idea: a 20,000 pound-sterling prize to anyone who had a solution.

I think the film is most useful in describing how the process of invention, or any scientific advance, really works.  There are always twists and turns and dead ends.  It is very difficult to know ahead of time who is on the right track and deserves funding, and who is just another weirdo with a strange idea.  As a person who has had a few strange ideas myself, I appreciate that.Another important point made by the film is the crucial role that prizes can play in technological advance.  The way the prize is organized is important.  Prizes given after the fact are all well and good, but have a limited effect.  Prizes that lay out ahead of time exactly what is wanted, with a large enough amount of money at stake for serious effort to be put into it, do help advance science and technology. I would like to see such a prize offered in elementary education--perhaps for a reliable method for teaching reading which is cheap to administer and which is 95% effective in producing kids who are functionally literate.  We could see some major advances in our schools.I found the film's scenes of life in the 18th century fascinating.  The 18th century was the last century  in which mankind had not yet become dependent on fossil fuels.

Schultz,"[1, 1]","This is a visually stunning 2-disc dramatization of Dava Sobel's book about 18th century struggles to produce an accurate, seaworthy clock that would enable sailors to know their location by knowing precisely what time it was.The acting is superb; the settings and production values are magnificent. This film does a worthy job of telling the story of John Harrison's 50-year battle to be granted the prize promised by the English Crown to the man who could produce a reliable timepiece.However this film attempts an expansion of Sobel's book that I'm not sure was quite warranted or that works. There is no full-length Director's Commentary on these DVD's. There is only a relatively short ""Making Of"" bonus feature. In that extra, it's revealed that the producers/director thought that they would bore modern audiences if they stuck to Sobel's almost exclusively 18th century narrative. They thought they had to introduce a more contemporary dramatic line that modern audiences could identify with better. So they layered Harrison's story with the story of Rupert Gould, the Englishman who in the 1930's undertook the task of restoring Harrison's clocks.The two men's stories are closely interwoven and indeed do have a lot in common. Both men became fixated on the minute workings of clocks - to the exclusion of most human relations. Both let their projects grow to engulf their whole lives. Both were continuously balked by the English Maritime bureaucracy.The movie often cuts so quickly from one narrative to the other that it is almost like watching split-screen action. The intention is perhaps to imitate the two armatures that extend from Harrison's counterbalance mechanism as these armatures nod towards each other, then separate in courtly, symmetrical minuet - over and over. However, the effect is more often simply disruptive and distracting.At least, it was jarring to me for the first 45 minutes or so. After that, I became a little more accustomed to the quick volley between Harrison and Gould. Still, I think Sobel's account of Harrison would have been able to stand on its own and be amply relevant to modern audiences. There were so many interesting episodes in the book that had to be omitted here in order to make room for the stereopticon duet involving Gould's life. However enough remains. There are swashbuckling sea adventures, intrigue in periwigged counsel chambers, and glowing scenes around the hearth.The occasional jaggedness of the interjection of Gould's story is a minor flaw in what is overall a wonderful cinematic achievement. ""Longitude"" is a prime example of how a film can be truly educational and entertaining at the same time.

The two worlds are the eighteenth century of John Harrison (1693 to 1776) and the twentieth century of Lieutenant Commander Rupert Gould (1890 to 1948).  This movie chronicles the life of Harrison who builds sea clocks and alternates his story with Gould's who restores Harrison's clocks and at the same time restores his own health. (Note that most of Sobel's book is concerned with Harrison's story while only four pages in the last chapter of her book are devoted to Gould's story.)The beginning of this movie is narrated and lasts less than three minutes.  However, this narration is probably the most important part of this movie because it tells the viewer about latitude and longitude, indirectly how to calculate longitude, how time is related to longitude, and why longitude was so difficult to measure ""during most of human history.""  (How to determine latitude was discovered centuries before this.)I felt this narration was adequate but it did not mention one simple and important fact:In 24 hours, the Earth spins 360 degrees on its axis from east to west.  (Thus, as the narrator states, four minutes of time equals one degree of longitude east or west.)The first of two DVDs tells the story of how ships (with their crew and valuable cargo) were being lost at sea because they could not determine their position properly since their navigators were unable to calculate the ship's longitude accurately.  As a result, the British parliament offered a reward that's equivalent to many millions of dollars today to anyone who could practically solve ""the longitude problem.""Most of the scientists of this time thought that this problem's solution, even at sea, was astronomical.  However, a lone genius, simple carpenter, and clockmaker named John Harrison (acted superbly by Michael Gambon) knew the fact stated above, so he reasoned that time was the solution to this problem.So Harrison began building a clock (eventually called a ""chronometer"") that would be accurate enough to be used by a ship at sea.  (Realize at this time there were only pendulum clocks that were quite bad at keeping time on a swaying ship at sea.)  The viewer is shown Harrison constructing his clocks with it's many components.  As well, we are shown the final beautiful result -- a clock that was to be used at sea.  (Note that this first clock was named ""H-1."")  We are also shown the maiden voyage of H-1 as it's tested in 1736 on a ship bound for Lisbon (with Harrison, a non-sailor, on board).  H-1 worked well during this trial.  Because of Harrison's perfectionism, he elected after this trial, to build a better clock called H-2 (which was never tested).  H-2 led to H-3 (which was also not tested).As mentioned above, we are also shown scenes of Rupert Gould's life (very well-acted by Jeremy Irons) that alternate with Harrison's adventure described above.  We are made aware that Gould's own life was tragic.  As a result, he volunteers as a sort of therapy to restore clocks H-1, H-2, and H-3 that, in his time, were almost two centuries old.  The result is that the viewer is shown more of the exterior and interior of Harrison's beautiful and complex ""timekeepers"" and how they actually work.The second DVD tells us of Harrison's masterpiece -- H-4 (that was the size of a large pocket watch).  As with H-1, H-4 is tested in 1761 on a ship bound for Jamaica with Harrison's grown son (well-acted by Ian Hart) on board.  This timepiece worked well.Also we are shown how Harrison had trouble collecting his monetary prize.  In fact, we hear one official on the board (the ""Board of Longitude"") responsible for bestowing this prize say, ""I would not wish to see the longitude prize stolen by a country toolmaker.""  As fate would have it, an astronomer who favored an astronomical method, Nevil Maskelyne (well-acted by Sam West) became the head of this board, causing further delays.  Harrison has to seek the assistance of King George the Third (well-acted by Nick Rowe) to cut through this bureaucracy.Meanwhile, Gould finishes restoring the clocks and manages at the same time to overcome his own problems.The acting of those indicated above and the supporting cast is exquisite.  The cinematography is breath-taking with the scenes at sea very realistic.  All costumes that represented the two alternating time periods transport the viewer back to those periods.  The movie itself has it all: intrigue, science, history, geography, astronomy, navigation, clockmaking, ambition, and greed.A minor complaint is that a simple calculation for determining longitude was not shown.  As well, the DVD only has one extra feature called ""Behind the Scenes.""Finally, although not absolutely necessary, I recommend reading Sobel's book before viewing this movie.  Doing this will enhance your enjoyment and understanding of the movie.In conclusion, this movie was an A&E; production.  As a result, viewing this movie is definitely ""time well spent.""+++++",5,True Story of a Lone Genius who Captured Time,1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,5288,"['+++++Note', 'review', 'been', 'written',

551585,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,B00004U2K1,Themis-Athena,"[34, 35]","In the 18th century much had already been achieved in the exploration of the world:  In addition to the achievements of Columbus, Cabot , Vespucci, Cartier, da Gama and others in the discovery of the Americas, Portuguese sailors commissioned by Prince Henry the Navigator (1394-1460) had sailed along the western African coast; Bartolomeu Dias (1457-1500) had circumnavigated the Cape of Good Hope; Vasco da Gama had been the first explorer to reach India by sea (1498); 1518-19 had seen Francisco Magellan's almost-complete global circumnavigation; in the mid-16th century Portuguese merchants and Jesuit missionaries had made contact with Japan; and about 50 years later the Dutch had established their first trading posts in South-East Asia.  On their voyages, these early explorers had overcome storms, hunger, scurvy and uncertainty about their exact course and the feasibility of their aim; and they had suffered from a severe navigational handicap:  For while it is comparatively easy to determine latitude, the exact determination of longitude requires consideration of the world's fourth dimension - time.  Only the knowledge how long the rotation of the earth vis-a-vis the sun takes from one point to another enables a seaman to determine where precisely he is at any given moment; wherefore he needs to know both the time at his departure port and the time aboard ship.  The inability to make that determination invariably adds the danger of getting lost at sea to the perils of every naval voyage (and in fact, even da Gama's Indian expedition was almost derailed when the navigator miscalculated his position off the African coast).Having emerged from the shadow of the continental European powers and become a major seafaring nation in its own right, the England of the Age of Reason was no longer willing to sacrifice thousands of sailors to the inability of determining longitude.  After the 1707 death of over 2000 men under the command of Admiral Sir Clowdisley Shovel, who had mistaken his ships' position for the coast of Brittany while in fact sailing right into the Scilly Islands off the coast of Cornwall, Queen Anne in 1714 signed an act promising a reward of 20,000 pounds (today, approximately $5 million) to the discoverer of a ""practicable and useful solution to the problem of finding longitude at sea.""  Among those taking the bait were proponents of rocket signals, would-be scientists working with injured dogs and a so-called ""powder of sympathy"" - and a self-taught Yorkshire carpenter named John Harrison (Michael Gambon).""Longitude,"" based on Dava Sobel's novel of the same name, tells the story of Harrison's quest; expanding the book's premise, however, and contrasting it with that of Navy Commander Rupert Gould (Jeremy Irons), who - having suffered a nervous breakdown in WWI - unearthed and restored Harrison's by then almost-forgotten chronometers.  Originally a TV mini-series, this is in fact one single coherent film; realized with the broad vision of a big-screen approach to filmmaking.  Part naval adventure, part historic docudrama, the movie first and foremost explores the two lead characters' hearts and souls:  That of the mercurial (yet, with his chronometers infinitely patient) Harrison and that of the fragile Gould; the former a puritan on a scientific mission, the latter searching for his peace of mind, hoping to regain it by giving new life to Harrison's timekeepers.  They are united by their infinite respect for all watches and clocks, which to them are living things - dearer, in a way, than their own flesh and blood - and by a screenplay joining their stories into a single rhythm of discovery, setbacks, apparent triumph, despair and fulfillment; seamlessly cutting between the 18th century's candle-lit world and that of the 20th century and its technical advances.Both Harrison and Gould are at odds with society's established rules:  Harrison, in the eyes of the Board of Longitude created to oversee the 1714 act, is utterly unworthy of receiving the prize; awarding it to him, according to board member Lord Morton, would be letting ""the longitude prize [be] stolen by a country toolmaker.""  Gould on the other hand, by sacrificing his marriage to the work on Harrison's chronometers, risks scandal and social isolation.  And the juxtaposition of Harrison's ever-more practical approach (eventually resulting in the creation of a chronometer just a little over 5 inches in diameter, capable to measure longitude within the revolutionary degree of approximately 1 minute or about 1 mile) and the method favored by the astronomers on the Board of Longitude (lunar observation, soon earning them and their darling, Astronomer Royal-to-be Reverend Nevil Maskelyne (Samuel West) the nickname ""lunatics"" in the Harrison household) is a classic tale of David vs. Goliath, and remains so even after Harrison Sr. is joined by his son William (Ian Hart).  Although his benefactor Graham has once suggested that, after having convinced the Admiralty and the Royal Society's initial appointees to the Board, Harrison's real test will be the politicians, it finally falls to Parliament to come to his aid, more than 50 years after he has begun his work; and after the intervention of stout Harrison supporter First Lord of the Admiralty and Secretary of State Lord Sandwich, Australian explorer Captain James Cook, and eventually even King George III, who likewise fancies himself a scientist.In addition to director Charles Sturridge's vision, ""Longitude"" benefits from the great sense of authenticity displayed by cinematographer Peter Hannan, production designers Eileen Diss and Chris Lowe and costume designer Shirley Russell - and from a cast list that virtually reads like a ""who is who"" of contemporary British cinema; featuring inter alia, besides Gambon, Irons, Hart and West, Gemma Jones (Elizabeth Harrison), Anna Chancellor (Muriel Gould) and Brian Cox (Lord Morton), as well as brief appearances by Stephen Fry as ""powder of sympathy"" proponent Sir Kelnhelm Digby and German actress Heike Makatsch as King George's wife Charlotte. - This is a complex, fascinating movie; one of televisions's finest hours in recent years:  Nothing for the mere casual viewer, but truly rewarding to anyone willing to join Harrison and Gould in their voyage of discovery.Also recommended:Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His TimeGalileo's Daughter: A Historical Memoir of Science,

The DVD did a great job describing the true story 0f Harrison giving 50 years of his life and his sons life to get the 20,000 LB prize from the English nobility and Lords for developing a reliable system to tell the time on the high seas so seaman could know where they are at longitude ( East/ West).We see the decades and decades John Harrison an excellent great clockmaker gives to develop different models of practical shipboard clocks that can keep accurate time so as to learn their longitude. We see the battles he has to go through against the ingrained stupidity of board members who wanted Astronomers to come up with the winning prize idea. He is forced to go to sea on long dangerous voyages to test his clocks.Then there is the flashback to a later age after WW1 where an inventor is trying to get John Harrison's clocks running again.The DVD was very interesting in a historical setting. I learned the dangers seaman had to go through without accurate ship time to know there East/West Longitude.

The transfer is very good and the DVD played without incident.,5,Where are we?,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,225,"['saw', 'movie', 'TV', 'long', 'time', 'still', 'love', 'think', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Too', 'bad', 'ironic', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'story', 'hubris', 'class', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'played', 'incident']",N/A

Next to fall into my possession was Sobel's 'The Illustrated Longitude' which was just superb and added so much to the story with all the amazing images. Subsequently when I came across the DVD 'Longitude' a few years back I quickly grabbed it.This film is wonderful and a delightful complement to Sobel's books. Michael Gambon and Jeremy Irons shine in their respective roles of John Harrison and Rupert Gould. The movie quickly draws you in and you soon find yourself sharing Harrison's challenge in his quest to solve the problem of finding longitude at sea, and feeling his frustration in the claiming of his prize with the big-headed politicking from the Board of Longitude consistently throwing new obstacles in his path.The story of Gould is interwoven with that of Harrison throughout the film and it works exceedingly well. Jeremy Irons excels in his portrayal of Gould and you share the man's passion for the timepieces as he discovers them in 1920 to gently take them under his wing and painstakingly restore them to their former glory, breathing life back into their little mechanical hearts. If it hadn't been for Gould then these ticking treasures could very well still be stashed away collecting dust and rust, or worse still they could have been destroyed during the war. For the producers to include Gould's story in the movie was a masterstroke.The supporting cast is excellent as is the detail to historical accuracy and setting. The film has a nice blend of intrigue, science, heartache, triumph, humour, passion and politics. Compelling, informative and entertaining, this is film is a winner and a definite keeper. The acting by all involved is stellar.A marvellous film that will be enjoyed by all the family. Chances are you won't look at clocks the same way ever again.",5,A Timeless Period Drama.

What I did not expect was the second parallel story, of the man responsible for restoring the clocks created by John Harrison. An equally wonderful story.If you have ever been to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich and have seen the restored clocks, you will enjoy seeing this film and how those clocks came into being and how they were restored to the state you can see them in today.",5,Great story!,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,653,"['Growing', 'up', 'heard', 'past', 'difficulties', 'sailors', 'had', 'finding', 'location', 'open', 'sea', 'film', 'truth', 'life', 'beautiful', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'ingenious', 'driven', 'man', 'who', 'helped', 'solve', 'problem', 'finding', 'longitude', 'What', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'was', 'second', 'parallel', 'story', 'man', 'responsible', 'restoring', 'clocks', 'created', 'John', 'Harrison', 'equally', 'wonderful', 'story.If', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'Royal', 'Observatory', 'Greenwich', 'have', 'seen', 'restored', 'clocks', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'film', 'how', 'clocks', 'came', 'being', 'how', 'were', 'restored', 'state', 'can', 'see', 'today']",N/A

First the true fantastic story of wanting to solve a problem that was killing people, for the fight with the snobbery who refused to believe a carpenter could solve the problem of longitude at sea.  I did not realize the amount of lost ships and sailors due to sailing from the hip out of the sight of land.Any man or woman who loves the sea and the heavens will need the history and  knowledge contained in this film and give them a very firm grip into celestial navigation.  Yes, we have GPS.  But to know the paths of the stars and 4th dimension of the time equation needed for longitude only gains more love for the sea and sky.The photographic path is very good, the acting takes you there, keeps you there,  You will watch it constantly and then buy the book which is my next step.",5,remembered,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,866,"['Saw', 'movie', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'immensely', 'enjoyable', 'many', 'levels', 'First', 'true', 'fantastic', 'story', 'wanting', 'solve', 'problem', 'was', 'killing', 'people', 'fight', 'snobbery', 'who', 'refused', 'believe', 'carpenter', 'could', 'solve', 'problem', 'longitude', 'sea', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'amount', 'lost', 'ships', 'sailors', 'due', 'sailing', 'hip', 'sight', 'land.Any', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'sea', 'heavens', 'will', 'need', 'history', 'knowledge', 'contained', 'film', 'give', 'very', 'firm', 'grip', 'celestial', 'navigation', 'Yes', 'have', 'GPS', 'know', 'paths', 'stars', '4th', 'dimension', 'time', 'equation', 'needed', 'longitude', 'only', 'gains', 'more', 'love', 'sea', 'sky.The', 'photographic', 'path', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'there', 'there', 'will', 'watch', 'constantly', 'then', 'buy', 'book', 'next', 'step']",N/A
