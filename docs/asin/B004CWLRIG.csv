1396358,AZUPF431ILUIH,B004CWLRIG,"FLY QUEEN ""Ace Shopper""","[11, 15]","This was a great movies. Never heard of it until I scrolled thru Amazon's list of Black movies. I enjoyed all of it, nothing wrong; no overplayed roles.The movie showed how 2 people can love in truth and in honest.  When you are in love, it does not pay to bring old baggage and past mistakes into a new marriage in 'SECRET'.You must tell of all your baggage that you know will cause a problem with your new spouse, especially if it had something to do with a close friend of your spouse. You can't keep that a secret because one day, it will slip out. The bridegroom's secret ate him up inside all the way to the altar saying his I DOs before he had the nerve to tell his bride-to-be, his secret.For a while it looked like no wedding was going to take place, but his love for her, prayer, explanations of what happened, and the pastor praying with both of them, brought them through.  Forgiveness is powerful and healing only if you have the GUTS to CONFESS YOUR SINS, AND THE GUTS TO FORGIVE A LOVE ONE.Many forget that ""what is done in the dark will come to the light'. God promised that and it will happen, so if you don't want to destroy your relationships or marriages, tell it all. Especially, if it involves many men or women, or a best friend. Those kinds of situations are too close not to tell.Even if you men had a lot of women, you still need to confess that, even without calling names, unless it is someone who you are still friends with now. That has to stop.  Same with you women. SO, LETS ALL BE GUILT FREE IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS AND BE FREE TO HAVE AND LIVE A WONDERFUL LOVE FILLED LIFE.I can't believe I saw this great movie for $1.99.  Beats Comcast any day.I love Amazon's new Instant Video. I've seen so many movies that I never heard of.THANKS AMAZON. I'M HOOKED ON YOU!!! LOL",5,BE TRUE IN LOVE.
