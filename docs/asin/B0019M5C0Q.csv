I am a fan of the first one; it may not have had the deepest plot and story-line but there was some substance to go along with the fun special effects laden action.I was very excited for the second movie - I'm 25, Transformers was a part of my childhood.Once again Micheal Bay ruins what could have been a good movie by relying on big explosions and effects to mask a dreadfully boring plot and story. The entire time I kept thinking ""Well what is the significance of this part? Well who is this robot? WHY are they fighting? HOW does this scene relate to anything? WHAT IS GOING ON HERE!?"" I'm talking about even within the opening scenes. And the swearing? Out of place! The Jar Jar Binks-esque comedy relief just added another layer of disappointment.Loved the first one... but my god this movie flat out sucks. I didn't believe the negative reviews on here and went to see this garbage anyway when I could have saved my time and money. Don't bother with this one.

Pulled off a few humor situations.Plot holes are present. It is a mindless popcorn movie you know. Not a 5 star by any stretch. I thought it was better than the first one.  M Fox working in a garage in dukes and sleeveless shirt was moronic but looked good as intended. Just needed 5lbs. of grease smeared on her for ""realism"", lol.  Hot exhaust pipe on those bare legs would cure her of those shorts.Big budget one liners and sight gags are the spikes forced into my ears and this one has them too, robot testes, love thing, man thong and the like.  90% of Terminator one liners were a travesty to all forms of entertainment too. If a movie costs over 75-100 million it starts out with strike one most times anyway. Designed for the lowest common denominator.The fight scenes are surprisingly intense. Found myself tensing up like a real fight scene does. Things move a little fast, I can follow it just would like to see it a little longer, would have more impact. Did I say plot holes?  Just a few and easy to ignore. Space boss made no sense as depicted.It earned an extra star even with all its problems because it was entertaining. Fox looks good. She does need to be quiet in the press some. I thought of some her statements during the movie, not a good sign. I usually shut that off while watching. Shia has charisma.

Government officials are stubborn, uniformed boobs, who one would have to wonder how they ever got put in that position in the first place.  Being in the military myself, I found it very insulting how government officials treated our military.  Ripping off someone's rank in the manner Galloway did would NEVER happen (at least not in public fashion).  Oh, and for the record there is absolutely NO WAY Tech Sergeant Epps would go from an E-5 (TSgt) to an E-9 (CMSgt) in TWO YEARS no matter how ""Classified"" the project was.  I won't delve too far into the military faade depicted in this movie, but I do have to mention I was almost excited for a moment.  When the predator was taking off they actually got it right--it's, after all, propeller driven.  Then as it arrived on scene it was once again JET PROPELLED!  I think Bay infused the Predator with the Global Hawk to make it cooler for the uninformed viewer.My last gripe would be the apparent lack of time in this film.  The characters seemed to move freely through space and time (maybe they had an upgraded flux capacitor).  In Bay's Universe it only takes a camera shift to go from Saturn to Earth, from Diego Garcia to the East Coast, from the East Coast to the Middle East, and all countries in the Middle East are as close as your neighborhood convenient store.  Having flown across the Atlantic more times than I'd care to count let me tell you--It's an ALL DAY event.  Add the extra day it would take to get to the Indian Ocean and you have one LONG movie--oh wait, this was 2  hours.  My bad.Well, this has already gone on longer than I had intended so I'll end with; the explosions were fun, the transformers looked amazing (aside from the Twins), the acting was as good as it could be given the script, and Bay was...well, BAY!",3,"The potential was there, but Michael Bay was the director!",1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,3014,"['Well', 'potential', 'was', 'there', 'once', 'again', 'Bay', 'over-exaggerated', 'stereo', 'types', 'believe', 'big', 'explosions', 'outweigh', 'importance', 'plot', 'reality', 'example', 'single', 'woman', 'Bay', 'universe', 'goddess', 'Paradise', 'Island', 'Would', 'hero', 'girl', 'really', 'be', 'seductively', 'sprawling', 'out', 'motorcycle', 'one', 'around', 'FATHER', 'order', 'give', 'characters', 'bit', 'edge', 'do', 'really', 'want', 'believe', ""'d"", 'sound', 'uneducated', 'ghetto-bots', 'Twins', 'were', 'more', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'C3PO', 'Harlem', 'nothing', 'worse', 'sophisticated', 'robots', 'acting', 'society', 'uneducated', 'worse', 'racial', 'clich', 'eacute', 'foul', 'language', 'LEG', 'HUMPING', 'Yes', 'transformer', 'dry', 'girl', 'leg', 'Bay', 'left', 'nothing', 'imagination', 'time', 'even', 'gave', 'giant', 'set', 'robot', 'testicles', 'Thanks', 'Michael', ""'re"", 'genius', 'continue', 'rant', 'rave', 'um', 'mean', 'offer', 'constructive', 'criticism', 'when', 'last', 'time', ""'ve"", 'been', 'frat', 'party', 'look', 'ANYTHING', 'what', 'Bay', 'envisions', 'have', 'wonder', 'ever', 'been', 'college', 'campus', 'Once', 'again', 'Bay', 'universe', 'hot', 'chicks', 'are', 'horny', 'jocks', 'are', 'brick-stupid', 'bullies', 'Government', 'officials', 'are', 'stubborn', 'uniformed', 'boobs', 'who', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'ever', 'got', 'put', 'position', 'first', 'place', 'Being', 'military', 'myself', 'found', 'very', 'insulting', 'how', 'government', 'officials', 'treated', 'military', 'Ripping', 'off', 'someone', 'rank', 'manner', 'Galloway', 'did', 'would', 'NEVER', 'happen', 'least', 'not', 'public', 'fashion', 'Oh', 'record', 'absolutely', 'WAY', 'Tech', 'Sergeant', 'Epps', 'would', 'go', 'E-5', 'TSgt', 'E-9', 'CMSgt', 'TWO', 'YEARS', 'no', 'matter', 'how', 'Classified', 'project', 'was', 'wo', ""n't"", 'delve', 'too', 'far', 'military', 'faade', 'depicted', 'movie', 'do', 'have', 'mention', 'was', 'almost', 'excited', 'moment', 'When', 'predator', 'was', 'taking', 'off', 'actually', 'got', 'right', 'propeller', 'driven', 'Then', 'arrived', 'scene', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'JET', 'PROPELLED', 'think', 'Bay', 'infused', 'Predator', 'Global', 'Hawk', 'make', 'cooler', 'uninformed', 'viewer.My', 'last', 'gripe', 'would', 'be', 'apparent', 'lack', 'time', 'film', 'characters', 'seemed', 'move', 'freely', 'space', 'time', 'maybe', 'had', 'upgraded', 'flux', 'capacitor', 'Bay', 'Universe', 'only', 'camera', 'shift', 'go', 'Saturn', 'Earth', 'Diego', 'Garcia', 'East', 'Coast', 'East', 'Coast', 'Middle', 'East', 'countries', 'Middle', 'East', 'are', 'as', 'close', 'neighborhood', 'convenient', 'store', 'Having', 'flown', 'Atlantic', 'more', 'times', ""'d"", 'care', 'count', 'let', 'tell', 'ALL', 'DAY', 'event', 'Add', 'extra', 'day', 'would', 'take', 'get', 'Indian', 'Ocean', 'have', 'one', 'LONG', 'movie', 'oh', 'wait', 'was', '2', 'hours', 'My', 'bad.Well', 'already', 'gone', 'longer', 'had', 'intended', 'so', ""'ll"", 'end', 'explosions', 'were', 'fun', 'transformers', 'looked', 'amazing', 'aside', 'Twins', 'acting', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'given', 'script', 'Bay', 'was', 'well', 'BAY']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

1163973,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0019M5C0Q,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","I actually really enjoyed the first installment of this franchise.  I never got into the cartoon as a kid and, to be honest, I only ever owned ONE of the action figures (a T-Rex) and my father broke it accidentally and never replaced it, but I didn't really care.  No, I only went to see the film because my best friend at the time was insistent that we go, and so we did, and I was truly entertained.  Yes, it had many faults (the graphics, while amazing, were a little bulky and the film was overly long) but it was a great way to waste a day, that's for sure.This one, is just a wasted day; period.Hollywood, popcorn munching, big-budget, explosion filled, mind numbing spectacles have no business crossing the two-hour mark; ever.  Okay, so some of them have, and some of them warrant that (I still love `Armageddon') but for the most part, two-hours is pushing it.  There is only so much you can do with that kind of atmosphere, and if you ware out your welcome you diminish any affection one may have towards the film as a whole.  This film is roughly an hour too long.  In fact, once they reach the desert, it's pretty much a collage of repeated sequences that made me want to pick out my eye-balls.How many times can you have the same battle before the audience just walks away?I liked the college part of the story, even if the parents were gimmicky caricatures (the mother was the funniest part of the whole film though, and it should be mentioned that she is also the most memorable).  I liked the faux tension between Sam and Mikaela, even if you don't really care about them as characters (yes, she is hot and he is charming, but really, who cares?).  I liked the base storyline, even though after a while things got confusing and rather stupid and just completely fell apart in the end.  To make a long story short, it opened with promise (a lot of promise) but it just went downhill, fast.I'm one of those rare guys who likes Shia LaBeouf.  I don't like the fact that he is dating the ubber hot and superiorly talented Carey Mulligan (marry me Jenny) but whatever.  At least he is talented (who would have ever guessed that?) and so I really hope that he has a big career after this phase in his life is over.  I mean, it's a big thing for a star this young to get a franchise like Transformers, because it paves the way for him to make something of himself.  He is a household name now because of this movie, but I think he has more in store than this drivel.Oh, and can I just say that this films racial stereotypes (those ghetto robots) are insulting.  I was blown away that they would GO there with this film.I'd watch the first half of the film and then shut of down before it ruins itself.  Isabel Lucas is extremely hot here and steals Fox's thunder a bit (although she's only in the first part of the film, so BOO) and Shia keeps the charm coming full throttle in order to keep you somewhat interested.  The graphics are the same as before, except there is more of them this go around, and that proves to be a blessing and a malediction.  The forest fight sequence is great; everything in the desert is not.Seriously, turn this off about half way through and you'll be satisfied.",2,Less than half a movie...,1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,3202,"['actually', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'installment', 'franchise', 'never', 'got', 'cartoon', 'kid', 'be', 'honest', 'only', 'ever', 'owned', 'ONE', 'action', 'figures', 'T-Rex', 'father', 'broke', 'accidentally', 'never', 'replaced', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'No', 'only', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'best', 'friend', 'time', 'was', 'insistent', 'go', 'so', 'did', 'was', 'truly', 'entertained', 'Yes', 'had', 'many', 'faults', 'graphics', 'amazing', 'were', 'little', 'bulky', 'film', 'was', 'overly', 'long', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'waste', 'day', 'sure.This', 'one', 'just', 'wasted', 'day', 'period.Hollywood', 'popcorn', 'munching', 'big-budget', 'explosion', 'filled', 'mind', 'numbing', 'spectacles', 'have', 'business', 'crossing', 'two-hour', 'mark', 'ever', 'Okay', 'have', 'warrant', 'still', 'love', 'Armageddon', 'most', 'part', 'two-hours', 'pushing', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'kind', 'atmosphere', 'ware', 'out', 'welcome', 'diminish', 'affection', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'towards', 'film', 'whole', 'film', 'roughly', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'fact', 'once', 'reach', 'desert', 'pretty', 'much', 'collage', 'repeated', 'sequences', 'made', 'want', 'pick', 'out', 'eye-balls.How', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'have', 'same', 'battle', 'audience', 'just', 'walks', 'away', 'liked', 'college', 'part', 'story', 'even', 'parents', 'were', 'gimmicky', 'caricatures', 'mother', 'was', 'funniest', 'part', 'whole', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'mentioned', 'also', 'most', 'memorable', 'liked', 'faux', 'tension', 'Sam', 'Mikaela', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'about', 'characters', 'yes', 'hot', 'charming', 'really', 'who', 'liked', 'base', 'storyline', 'even', 'while', 'things', 'got', 'confusing', 'rather', 'stupid', 'just', 'completely', 'fell', 'apart', 'end', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'opened', 'promise', 'lot', 'promise', 'just', 'went', 'downhill', 'fast.I', ""'m"", 'one', 'rare', 'guys', 'who', 'likes', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'dating', 'ubber', 'hot', 'superiorly', 'talented', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'marry', 'Jenny', 'least', 'talented', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'guessed', 'so', 'really', 'hope', 'big', 'career', 'phase', 'life', 'mean', 'big', 'thing', 'star', 'young', 'get', 'franchise', 'Transformers', 'way', 'make', 'something', 'household', 'name', 'now', 'movie', 'think', 'more', 'store', 'drivel.Oh', 'can', 'just', 'say', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'ghetto', 'robots', 'are', 'insulting', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'would', 'GO', 'there', 'film.I', ""'d"", 'watch', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'then', 'shut', 'down', 'Isabel', 'Lucas', 'extremely', 'hot', 'here', 'steals', 'Fox', 'thunder', 'bit', 'only', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'so', 'BOO', 'Shia', 'charm', 'coming', 'full', 'throttle', 'order', 'keep', 'somewhat', 'interested', 'graphics', 'are', 'same', 'more', 'go', 'around', 'be', 'blessing', 'malediction', 'forest', 'fight', 'sequence', 'great', 'everything', 'desert', 'not.Seriously', 'turn', 'off', 'half', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'satisfied']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

This installment involves the darker, evil Transformers known as Decepticons who want to take back the power they lost way back when. We start with Sam going off to college, determined not to let Bumblebee or any other Autobots interfere with his new, normal life-experience. He tries to keeps connected with his girlfriend, Mikaela who's back at home, via webcam. Sam keeps trying to be normal, but that's just not possible when the Decepticons are after him. That's when everything starts rolling, and, you guessed it, the Autobots need Sam's help again to save the world AGAIN. The action was non-stop (some might think there was too much action), and the graphics and explosions were fantastic just like the first movie.

The Autobots ask for Sam's help, who declines. Soon enough, Sam is in trouble as Megatron tries to capture him because he holds the map to where the Matrix of Leadership is kept. During his rescue, Optimus is destroyed and the Autobots are asked to leave the planet by the government.

I love movies so I went to go see it anyway and boy did it suck. The Decepticons looked awesome but the movie followed every basic summer blockbuster cliche known to man. Here are some problems I hate with the filmThe red and green car followed Sam around and the little truck robot were all stereotypes. Red and green acted like gangsta's and reminded me of Jar Jar Binks in a way. They were so friggin annoying. The truck played off as a wise guy from Brooklyn. He reminded me of Frank from Men in Black but less cuter to look at.Sex. A movie staring Megan Fox had sex in it and it wasn't five stars?!

She looked alot like Angelina Jolie in this film but way would you film more then half here scenes in slow-motion? But damn, she is friggin smoking.The humor was the kind of quick chuckle but doesnt last long kind. Make sense?

1163983,A2Y0N656MWUCXU,B0019M5C0Q,Archanubis80,"[3, 5]","The Story:Picking up two years after the end of the last movie, Revenge of the Fallen begins with the Autobots, working with their human allies, led by Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel), hunting down the few remaining Decepticons on Earth. The alliance, called NEST, tracks down two in an industrial part of Shanghai, China and manage to dispatch the pair, but not before receiving a warning that ""the Fallen shall rise again."" Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is preparing to go off to college, ready for a ""normal"" life after his action in Mission City and struggling to maintain his relationship with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox), who is staying behind. However, an encounter with a fragment of the shattered Allspark will again thrust Sam into the middle of the centuries-long war between the Cybertronian factions.The Good:I want to first comment on something that isn't related to the movie's content, but I think is worth mentioning: seeing this film on IMAX is an experience worth the $[...] I paid to get in. I've been to IMAX films before, but they've all been documentaries in museums, not Hollywood blockbusters. I had tried to see the last Star Trek film at my local IMAX theater, but as I mentioned before, if you don't get those tickets at least the day before, you're not getting one at all. I'm glad I got my ticket the day before, because every seat in the theater was filled by the time the film started, which pretty much started at the time advertised. Aside from the usual courtesy notices, I didn't have to sit through fifteen minutes of commercials and trailers before the film started (thank God, really, I don't think I could stand watching that hideous trailer for G.I. Joe again). There are rumors that the IMAX version of Revenge has scenes that aren't in the regular theatrical release, but having not seen the regular release, I can't compare the two. I did note that the scene with Sam Witwicky's phone conversation with Mikaela and her subsequent discovery of Wheelie had dialogue not shown in the Internet sneak peaks I'd seen before the movie's release, but how that differs from the theatrical release, I couldn't say. I highly recommend catching this film in an IMAX theater if you have the opportunity, before the distributors move on to the next Hollywood blockbuster - if they haven't already.Moving on to the movie's content, I'll start off with the action in the film, which, as most people know, is practically Michael Bay's trademark. Say what you will about Bay's directing style, but the film's action sequences are intense, quick, and managed to hold my attention. Yes, there's still the ""shaking camera"" effect that is prevalent in modern action films, and some of the scenes fly by in a ""blink and you'll miss it"" fashion, but at least this time you get to see who's who in a fight. The best action scenes are during the fight in Shanghai, the three on one fight in some unnamed forest in New York (or New Jersey, it better be one of the two), and the final battle between NEST and the Decepticons in Egypt. You wanted more robot fights, well Bay and the writers give you more robot bashings. Watching Sideswipe slice Sideways in half in Shanghai was a great scene (I agree with Sideswipe, he is good) but it's Optimus Prime (voiced by the legendary Peter Cullen) who gets to shine in this film. From taking on a Decepticon nearly five times his size, fighting off three Decepticons at once, and even taking on the titular god-like ancient known as the Fallen (given voice by Tony Todd of Candyman fame), it's clear that the writers and director intended to make Prime a tougher character, and to an extent, they may have succeeded too well here. There have been criticisms by some fans that Prime displayed no such fighting talent in the first film and that Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving), despite having been resurrected in a theoretically more powerful form, switches to the role of punching bag with Prime. I'd like to point out that Prime does basically wail on Bonecrusher in the first film and was fighting the climactic battle with Megatron in the middle of a crowded major population center. In the latter case, it is possible Prime was holding back in that fight out of concern for harming innocents, while Megatron, of course, would have no such concerns. It should also be pointed out that Prime has had two years to hone his combat skills, while Megatron has been rusting on the ocean floor for that time and now has to get used to an essentially brand new body. The two big fights between Prime and Megatron occur in more sparsely populated and open areas, giving former the chance to go all out without concerning himself with collateral damage.One of the criticisms leveled at the first film was the lack of characterization with the robot characters and too much focus on the humans. Humans still play a large part in Revenge, but there are very few additions to the human cast in this film. The only new addition that has any significant screen time is the character of Leo Spitz (Ram&oacute;n Rodr&iacute;guez); most of the other new additions play only a minor role or are limited to cameos. Instead, the filmmakers chose to introduce more personalities into the Transformers themselves, though most of it is focused on some of the newer Autobots. The most obvious examples are the twins Skids (Tom Kenny) and Mudflap (Reno Wilson), who have been the focus of accusations that they are ""annoying"" at their mildest, at worst "" promoting negative racial stereotypes."" I'll admit, their faces are ugly, their manner of speaking is questionable, and they spend most of their screen time arguing and fighting with each other (Bumblebee even has to knock some sense into them at one point). But I didn't find them half as annoying as some fans and most critics claimed - I'll admit, I laughed at some of their comments and antics.One character I was pleasantly surprised with was that of Jetfire, the old Decepticon turned Autobot. As with Bumblebee in the first movie, I was a little nervous when I heard that Jetfire would be a ""geriatric"" robot with rusting, crumbling parts and a memory core that likely needs defragging. But the writers, animators and voice actor Mark Ryan manage to successfully depict the character whose gone a little too long without energon and a visit to a CR chamber. The fact that he transforms into an SR-71 Blackbird, one of the most popular aircraft to have been developed and current speed record holder, doesn't hurt - though farting out a parachute is probably pushing it a little bit. I'm also curious as to why the VA was changed from John Turturro (reprising his role of Agent Simmons (retired)) as earlier report to Mark Ryan, but that's a minor quibble. I won't say that my eyes started to tear up when Jetfire sacrificed himself to give Prime an edge against the Fallen - it didn't - but it is a nobler and more touching death than that of Jazz in the first film.Another, rather surprising, breakout was that of the character Wheelie, a name that is perhaps the most universally reviled within the fandom. Before this film, the name had only been used once, for a character introduced in the 1986 animated film known for his rhyming manner of speaking, high-pitched voice, and a rather simplistic toy that isn't considered the best ever made. Personally, I've neither liked nor disliked the character, but any new incarnation could only be considered an improvement. Wheelie of Revenge of the Fallen is definitely a vast improvement over his original counterpart. Voiced by Tom Kenny and transforming into a RC truck, his accent and personality is much closer to that of Rattrap from Beast Wars than his namesake. Wheelie gets some of the best lines in the movie and he comes off much scrappier than his toy bio indicates, though ""Warrior Goddess"" Mikaela still manages to kowtow him. At least one of his antics could have been changed drastically, but overall, the writers manage to make this Wheelie work.Most of the Decepticons in the movie are again limited to growls, grunts, and other sounds, as they were in the first Transformers. A few, like Demolisher and Soundwave, have lines, but the lion's share of dialogue is taken up by the Fallen, Megatron, and Starscream. Hugo Weaving is again perfect as this ""universe's"" Megatron, reprising the sinister, growling tone he used in the first movie - and this time, he gets more to do. He also get's one of the best lines in the film: ""Starscream, I'm home!"" Charlie Adler reprises his role as Starscream and we get more characterization from the Decepticon lieutenant than his two lines in the first movie hinted at. It's clear that Adler is at least attempting to channel a little bit of Chris Latta into his performance, and while he doesn't quite get the tone, he does manage to get Starscream's classic sniveling, cowardly, scheming personality down. The audience is also treated to the classic, dysfunctional relationship between Megatron and Starscream, right down to Megatron's berating, and even physical abuse against his lieutenant for ""his"" failures.As a long time fan of Transformers, I have to say it is a pure joy that Frank Welker joins the cast reprising his role as Soundwave. I was a little disappointed that Soundwave talks with the unmodified ""Dr. Claw"" voice; the classic voice would have fit well in this universe, I think. However, I can accept that it isn't modified, especially since its Welker voicing Soundwave. The character does little outside of coordinating the other Decepticons from orbit, intercepting transmissions, and launching Ravage towards Diego Garcia - then again, he didn't do much more than that in the original cartoon. Speaking of Ravage, he was a character I couldn't wrap my mind around when I first saw his design. I'm still not keen on his spiky, cycloptic appearance, but his actions acquit his physique. He definitely a dangerous, deadly opponent, as witnessed when he covers the ""Reedman"" bot from the Deigo Garcia personnel and again when he takes on Bumblebee while he's fighting Rampage. It's just too bad Bumblebee gets the better of him - gruesomely. However, Soundwave has apparently survived, giving me hope that Laserbeak may make an appearance in the next film.The Bad:There are a lot of good things with Revenge of the Fallen, but there are plenty of things that were wrong with the movie. The most obvious is that lack of exposure for some of the characters, both new and old. Soundwave, as mentioned above, has relatively little screen time, though that could be a function of where he's situated throughout the film. Most of the Constructicons have no dialogue at all: Rampage has a voice credit, but I don't recall him actually saying anything - it's possible it was lost in all the background noise. For the Autobots, most of the screen time is taken up by Optimus Prime, the Twins, and Bumblebee (Mark Ryan), whose back to speaking through his radio despite regaining his voice in last movie. By contrast, returning Autobots Ironhide (Jess Harnell) and Ratchet (Robert Foxworth) have even less lines in this movie than they did in the last one. In addition, new Autobots Sideswipe (Andr&eacute; Sogliuzzo), the Arcee trio (Grey DeLisle) and Jolt have little screen time and few lines - in Jolt's case, no lines. It would have been nice to have at least devoted a little more time to fleshing out the new characters a little. In Jolt's case; it would have been nice to have included him in a few more scenes than the mere two he was in, especially some of the fight scenes.Speaking of characters, Scalpel, simply referred to as ""Doctor"" in the film and voiced by John Di Crosta, is great character in concept and his actions. Sure would have been nice, though, if I could have been able to understand what he was saying. Between his thick faux German accent and whatever electronic modulation is being used (if any), Scalpel's dialogue comes across more as constant buzzing than a coherent sentence. Occasionally I could understand a word or two, but it would have been better if they had just dropped the mad German scientist shtick.Being a Michael Bay flick, the addition of a hot chick or two to serve as eye candy for his arguably mostly male audience is a given. Revenge of the Fallen is no different, with Megan Fox reprising her obligatory role as eye candy Mikaela from the original movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the writers or the director quite knows what to do with the character this time around. At least in the first movie, Mikaela has her use beyond giving Sam (the boys in the audience) something to drool over: she sliced Frenzy's head off and first towed a wounded Bumblebee out of and then back into a combat zone - under fire no less. While she does manage to wrangle Wheelie and run Alice over with a car, both of these actions are a far cry from charging at the heavily armed, hulking Decepticon that was Brawl. Like newcomer Leo, Mikaela just seem to be along for the ride in this movie, occasionally arguing with Sam, mostly over who should say ""I love you,"" and even becoming a naysayer at the Tomb of the Primes. While I can't see the film without her, I think the writers should have found a way to make her more - useful.Speaking of eye candy, introducing Isabel Lucas as the Decepticon "" Pretender "" Alice seemed like a good idea, but more I think about her scenes in the movie, the more I think she served only two purposes - rather freaky eye candy and a cheap way to get Sam, Mikaela, and Leo off campus and somewhere that Grindor, the carbon copy of Blackout from the first film, can grab them. Personally, a trip to the local park might have been a better means of doing that. Pretenders were initially introduced during the ""Generation One"" period, though they've become rather obscure in recent years. Reintroducing the concept into this film seemed like a good idea and the effects are excellent, if a little Terminator-esque, but Alice's overall inclusion just seems superfluous. In addition, the character comes off as a little too aggressive and overt towards Sam; I think even a Decepticon would be able to be more subtle. I will say that I enjoyed Bumblebee beating on her when she hitched a ride with him and Sam, and even his attempts to give Sam hints that she wasn't what she seemed, appropriately playing ""Superfreak"" at one point.Another staple of Bay films is the inclusion of a usually half-baked romance between the principle male and female characters. The relationship started between Sam and Mikaela in the first film continues in this one - and is about as unnecessary to the plot as in the first one. Sam and Mikaela spend most their time together arguing about something; who's going to say ""I love you"" before Sam goes off to college and again when spending a night under the Great Pyramids. They have unrelated argument as they're trying to hide from Alice's rampage, when Mikaela thinks Sam was cheating on her - though this one was more legit, since Mikaela had no idea that Alice was, quite literally, the aggressor. Fortunately, the love story doesn't overwhelm the story, but like Alice, it's a bit redundant.Disappearing characters are minor annoyance in the film as well. Most blatant of these is Barricade from the first movie, who disappeared right before Bonecrusher transformed to take on Prime and was never seen again. It's not unreasonable to assume that he fell victim to the NEST alliance in the intervening years, but I still find it to be a glaring oversight on the part of the filmmakers. Barricade could have been used in the Shanghai battle in place of Sideways, just to explain his fate, and Sideways used as the means by which the Decepticons capture Sam instead of Grindor and Alice. Another character who disappears without explanation is Scalpel, who vanishes after Prime and Bumblebee break into the warehouse where the Decepticons are about to dissect Sam. The comic adaptation has Prime shoot Scalpel into pieces when the latter breaks in and it's not a far stretch that Scalpel could have been caught in the melee and crushed. The final character to slip into the editing void is Wheelie, who is apparently just left in the Egyptian desert after Sam, Mikaela, Leo, Simmons, Bumblebee and the Twins head off to Giza. It would have been nice to have added him to the brief epilogue scenes before the credits, just to know what happens. Characters that disappear without explaination is a familiar, though annoying, phenomenon in the Transformers franchise, so we really shouldn't expect the movies to be any different. Still, it would be nice sometimes if the writers could tie up loose ends.The Expendable:Crude jokes were present in the first Transformers film and they're present in Revenge of the Fallen as well. Low blow humor isn't exactly new to the series - anyone remember ""The Low Road"" from Beast Wars? Still, some of the humor in the film seemed unnecessary, and some of it shouldn't have even been considered. One example is the scene where Jetfire reveals that he switched sides, prompting Wheelie to do the same - and right after, Wheelie proceeds to ""hump"" Mikaela's leg. I'll admit, I wasn't surprised by it - I had read about in the sole fan review I saw - and I did laugh, but after two similar scenes with the Witwicky mutts, this was just one scene too many. That scene could have been written with something better to showcase Wheelie's... enthusiasm.Another scene of low blow humor that could have been excluded was just after Sam's group arrives at the Smithsonian Air & Space Udvar-Hazy Annex. As he prepares to infiltrate the museum, Simmons removes his pants to reveal - that he's wearing a thong. Not only is this rather disturbing sight revealed to the audience, but it's done so at extreme close up, butt crack and all. Mr. Bay, if in the extremely unlikely event you happen to be reading this, I know you like to appeal to the high school and college set who think this kind of thing is funny, but was this scene really necessary? The majority of the audience in the theater I was in emitted a very loud groan when this scene appeared (and they say modern movie audiences have no taste).Let's make one thing clear: I like this Devastator. I like him the first time I saw him in action in the initial trailers, even if he looked like Unicron's ugly stepchild. I can forgive the fact that he doesn't really do all that much actual fighting in the film. I can accept the idea that he's so heavy that he is forced to walk like a giant mechanized gorilla. I can even accept the idea his components have copies that don't make up the Gestalt - evidenced by the fact that Long Haul, Rampage, and Mixmaster are all wandering around while Dev's doing his best impression of King Kong on the pyramid. Unfortunately, someone - the director, the writers or a bored animator at ILM - decided to give Devastator a pair of brass balls - literally. These ""robo-testicles,"" first noticeable when this behemoth starts climbing the pyramid, look like they're made from wrecking balls, which is odd considering none of his components are vehicles that carry such a tool. He does have a crane that forms his arm that could explain one ball, but two? And why isn't it on his arm instead of between his legs? Granted, this kind of ""humanization"" is not new in Transformers, but it's been mostly limited to female Transformers characters (which, in a species of alien robots, is questionable in and of itself). Overall, Devastator's balls are a strange and extraneous physical feature that only serves to give Simmons a shot at cracking a lewd joke at the giant's expense.Lastly, the award for most expendable element or character in the film has to go to Jolt, the eleventh hour addition to an arguably already crowded cast, and glaringly so. Jolt doesn't even show up until the about midway through the movie, and all he does is stand around in the background, weapons crackling. He shows up one more time, just before Prime takes on the Fallen, using his whips to basically magnetize Optimus and Jetfire's remains so that the two merge. In my opinion, if the filmmakers were going to spend the time and money creating the CGI model for the character, they could have at least put him in a few more scenes. They could have initially introduced him greeting the NEST team as they returned from Shanghai and added him to a couple of the battle scenes, just to justify the cost of his CGI model. I do have hope that Jolt will have a larger role in the next movie, especially since the apparent demise of Jetfire and Arcee has thinned the Autobot cast slightly. Unfortunately, it's more likely that poor Jolt will disappear into the same writing void that claimed Barricade.Final Thoughts:Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a fun film to watch, especially in an IMAX format, and is arguably better than its predecessor - a rarity for any film sequel. It does have problems that could have been fixed with a little refinement in the writing, but let's face facts shall we? This is a movie that's A) based on a toy line, B) based on a series of cartoon series, C) directed by Michael Bay. If you're expecting something with the quality of a Sundance Festival film, you're in the wrong building. Still, I believe it was worth my $11.",4,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Review (Warning: Spoilers),1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,21374,"['Story', 'Picking', 'up', 'two', 'years', 'end', 'last',

But hey wait what's missing here...... oh Sh*# thats right a plot to makes sense. Like a good reviewer best put it ""Michael Bay got paid 75 million dollars to lose his freaking mind"" cause that is exactly what he displayed here. While the actions are awesome and beautifully done it does not even redeem the sheer stupidity of the story line that only fans and kid fans of the series can enjoy. I have seen the film and 3 of my other (Super transformers fans)friends have seen it and while sadly one of my friend loved it because he even admitted that since he is a fan of the franchise he is biased. Well anyway my other 2 friends and i agreed with this fact while action wise it surpasses the original story wise it was far worse than the first could ever be and it was far longer than it needed to be 150 mins WHAT THE HELL. Bay had the nerve to insult the smarter viewers by thinking that everyone will be glad with just explosions and destructions that we won't care if a story is not present he probably thought we would be ""Duuuh autobot went boom yhaaaaay"" he even made a statment saying that we should ""Take the film for what it is"" well i did it's crap. the acting here was bad and i blame bay for lack of direction for them. Many fans who read this will be mad and say that i don't know what i'm talking about and my response will be ""thank you for proving that you are in denial and biased that you do not want to admit that you threw $10. down the toilet."" in closing if you are a fan who can be unbiased and have seen enough movies to tell what is actually a good film then we can agree this film sucks.",1,only for transformers fans PERIOD!,1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,1734,"['Yeah', 'got', 'parts', 'transformers', 'fans', 'want', 'more', 'action', 'more', 'explosions', 'more', 'autobots', 'more', 'decepticons', 'hey', 'wait', 'what', 'missing', 'here', 'oh', 'Sh*', 'thats', 'right', 'plot', 'sense', 'good', 'reviewer', 'best', 'put', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'got', 'paid', '75', 'million', 'dollars', 'lose', 'freaking', 'mind', 'cause', 'exactly', 'what', 'displayed', 'here', 'actions', 'are', 'awesome', 'beautifully', 'done', 'not', 'even', 'redeem', 'sheer', 'stupidity', 'story', 'line', 'only', 'fans', 'kid', 'fans', 'series', 'can', 'enjoy', 'have', 'seen', 'film', '3', 'other', 'Super', 'transformers', 'fans', 'friends', 'have', 'seen', 'sadly', 'one', 'friend', 'loved', 'even', 'admitted', 'fan', 'franchise', 'biased', 'Well', 'anyway', 'other', '2', 'friends', 'i', 'agreed', 'fact', 'action', 'wise', 'original', 'story', 'wise', 'was', 'far', 'worse', 'first', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'was', 'far', 'longer', 'needed', 'be', '150', 'mins', 'WHAT', 'HELL', 'Bay', 'had', 'nerve', 'insult', 'smarter', 'viewers', 'thinking', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'just', 'explosions', 'destructions', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'story', 'not', 'present', 'probably', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Duuuh', 'autobot', 'went', 'boom', 'yhaaaaay', 'even', 'made', 'statment', 'saying', 'should', 'Take', 'film', 'what', 'well', 'i', 'did', 'crap', 'acting', 'here', 'was', 'bad', 'i', 'blame', 'bay', 'lack', 'direction', 'Many', 'fans', 'who', 'read', 'will', 'be', 'mad', 'say', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'i', ""'m"", 'talking', 'response', 'will', 'be', 'thank', 'proving', 'are', 'denial', 'biased', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'admit', 'threw', '10', 'toilet', 'closing', 'are', 'fan', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'unbiased', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'movies', 'tell', 'what', 'actually', 'good', 'film', 'then', 'can', 'agree', 'film']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
1163988,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B0019M5C0Q,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[3, 4]","According to common wisdom, the plot of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is incomprehensible. Which is odd, as it actually seemed reasonably straightforward to me. Essentially it goes like this:Thousands of years ago - and apparently without anyone noticing - the Decepticons placed a device inside the Great Pyramid of Giza that can blow up the Sun and harvest it for energon, which they can use to fuel themselves and possibly restore their dying homeworld of Cybertron. The Fallen - the Decepticons' supreme commander, senior even to Megatron - wants to activate the device, but he fears setting foot on Earth due to the threat posed by Optimus Prime (apparently only 'a Prime' can kill him). Also, the device's starting key, the 'Matrix of Leadership', has been missing for millennia. The Autobots and their human allies end up getting involved in the Decepticon plan to find the key and start the machine and the whole matter is resolved in a string of unlikely plot coincidences and stupendous explosions (spoiler: the good guys win).What confuses the matter is Michael Bay's total inability to selectively self-edit. The problem with Revenge of the Fallen - aside from those inherent to the franchise established in the opening movie which it is far too late to do anything about - isn't that the ingredients are wrong or that you couldn't make an entertaining movie with them, but that Bay and the writers throw every single half-baked idea they have into the mix, regardless of whether it makes sense or if they have the screentime to do it justice. In isolation, ideas like Devastator (a massive robot made up of seven lesser ones), the Pretender (a Terminator-esque Decepticon assassin that can pass as human) or Jetfire (an elderly Decepticon who switched sides to join the Autobots, got bored with the war and has spent decades disguised as an exhibit in the Smithsonian) could have made for interesting scenes or story points. Thrown on top of one another, they decohere the story and make it increasingly hard work to follow what's going on amidst the ridiculous number of fireballs being hurled around.Matters aren't helped by the human cast: Shia LeBouf was blandly inoffensive in the first movie, but doesn't have the acting chops to sell Sam Witwicky's plot-inspired descent into temporary insanity, which reduces the middle third of the movie into barely-bearable tedium, though things are briefly livened up by the arrival of the Pretender assassin, a cool idea which is underdeveloped. In fact, most of the human performances are uninspired and uninteresting. There's also a bizarre lack of emotional response to events in the film. At one point a US aircraft carrier is destroyed and sinks, taking with it thousands of lives and an appreciable fraction of the USA's military power, but this garners almost no response whatsoever from anyone. No-one seems to be particularly concerned about the partial destruction of the Great Pyramid of Giza, either.The Transformers themselves also suffer from the problems of plot overload. Compared to the dozen or so in the first movie, there are about forty in the second, and very few have any development or interesting character traits. Those that do get more screentime tend to be lazily-written and based on human racial stereotypes and caricatures which are inappropriate and moronic. Still, from the carnage Jetfire emerges as a more interesting character that not enough is done with, whilst Optimus Prime and Bumblebee develop well over their roles in the first movie. Indeed, Peter Cullen's dignified voice performance does seem to have come in from a completely different and considerably better film altogether. The Decepticons are mostly lacking in any kind of development whatsoever with the Fallen being a colossal disappointment and Devastator being a let-down after an impressive first appearance. The film's lack of memorable villains is a key problem (though hardly the greatest in the picture).What really damages the film beyond all possible repair, however, is its severe pacing problem. The climactic battle sequence in the Egyptian desert (written by someone who's never looked at a map of the Middle East, but let's not go there) goes on for far too long, eating away at screentime that could have been better-used earlier in the movie to flesh out more interesting concepts and ideas, or simply could have been removed: two and a half hours is probably way too long for a brainless popcorn action movie in the first place.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (*) is a spectacular failure of a movie, being incoherent, badly-paced, badly-acted and ill-conceived. The special effects are genuinely impressive and there are glimpses of concepts that could have made for a great film, but these are left underdeveloped in favour of atrocious attempts at comedy or pathos. It's certainly not the worst movie of all time, as some have labelled it, and it's almost worth watching as a masterclass in how not to make a big-budget action film. A tremendous let-down considering some promising ideas and also the inoffensively entertaining first movie in the franchise.",1,"A staggering failure of a movie, considering some good

The story was straightforward enough, but the sexual jokes and innuendoes were extremely annoying enough to make me wonder if this movie was actually bucking for an ""R"" rating.Not only did I not find them funny, I was  embarrassed that kids would actually see all that.Ron and Judy Witwicky were only good toward the end and spoiled what was a halfway decent picture otherwise when they weren't in it. I could forgive Skids and Mudflap, after all, they were aliens, though just as annoying. I will say that the Smackdown in the forest with Prime and the Decepticons and the battle with the Fallen at the end was well worth seeing.I honestly believed in both of those encounters that Megatron and the Fallen both had no idea of just what kind of power and rage that Optimus was truly capable of.

I thought the 1st movie and most of the cartoon series were wonderful and could not wait until this movie was released. Words cannot describe how painfully disappointed I was in this film. To me there was no worthy plot. This should have been called ""The Witwicky Chronicles featuring the Transformers"". There is too much emphasis on the human characters in this movie. Do we really need to know that Sam is going to college? Do we need to see his mom crying and acting stupid for a straight 30 minutes? Did we need to introduce new human characters and give them a bigger part of the movie than the robots that the film is named after? Also Shia is one of the most annoying actors out there today, which made it even harder for me to watch.  This is not at all what I expected from a TF movie. When I think of a TF movie I think of TRANSFORMERS, and nothing else. I could care less for the human side of the story. In the future I would suggest less human interaction. More story behind the Robots. (btw did the new TF's even have names?) More screen time with the robots and did I mention, less humans? Kind of like the cartoons, you know? I also found a lot of the movie inappropriate. I love crude humor and inappropriateness, but this is not the format for such things. I could have done without the dog humping, testicle jokes.  This type of thing has no relevance to the Transformers, so keep it out of the movie. Overall , less humans, get rid of Shia, stay out of the desert, and give the bots the majority of the screen time. I haven't given up yet though. Hopefully the makers will notice their mistakes and make the next film better.Another thing I'd like to add, since when does Megatron answer to anyone?

1163995,A2JE9B8J80F2U9,B0019M5C0Q,b-gat,"[2, 5]","I thought the first Transformers movie had too many distracting human characters and didn't focus enough on the actual Transformers (sometimes literally -- it was hard to see what was going on in the action sequences), but at least it was an enjoyable enough popcorn movie.  This one takes everything I didn't like about the first movie and amplifies it, and then drops everything I enjoyed until the last ten minutes or so.The cast of characters in this movie is pretty much everyone you ever hated in high school, plus Optimus Prime, and then Jar Jar Binks times three.  I'm serious; there are at least THREE characters in this movie who are basically Jar Jar clones: extremely irritating, utterly useless sidekicks whose dialogue makes you wonder if the director and screenwriter are closet racists.  There's also a group of soldiers who are okay, but they have like five lines of dialogue between them, and their entire contribution to the first 4/5 of the movie is to show up periodically to walk slowly and look saintly.  The plot is somehow simultaneously inordinately convoluted and entirely unnecessary.  Most of the screen time that isn't just things blowing up or spinning involves Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox arguing about when one of them is going to tell the other one they love them, or else Shia's parents screeching about random ridiculous crap.There are robots in this movie, but most of them look and sound exactly the same.  (There's one cool sequence early on with a tiger-shaped robot and his tiny friends, but that's definitely the exception.)  Megatron and Starscream are essentially the same character.  I couldn't tell which object was Ironhide until 2 hours and 15 minutes into the movie.  I don't have any idea who the other Autobots were, besides Bumblebee and Optimus Prime.  It's hard to care at all about the outcome of a battle when you can't tell who's who, so the fight sequences here are about as compelling as footage of an iPhone in a blender.  That can be fun, sure, but it's certainly not worth 2 and a half hours of your time.If you want to know if you'll enjoy this movie, look at the reviews from people who liked it.  Do they sound like intelligent people who share your tastes and values?  If you think they do, you'll probably enjoy it.

The problem is the 1st Transformers was done with a wink-in-the-eye sense of humor. This one has almost zero humor in it and any attempts at it are lame. I just didn't get why they had two jive talkin' transformers. Is this the 1970s?The whole premise seems flimsy. The US has some heavily secured facilities yet they are so easy to break into despite the fact they now know the evil Transformer decepticon robots exist. Then deaths here are cartoonish (OK, the series comes from a cartoon but it's still dumb).Also, explain to me how the mom and dad end up in Egypt. I still don't get how in the middle of some massive battle they just pop up when we last saw them maybe an hour ago in Paris.Also, the thing they are chasing or whatever is called the ""matrix."" Wow, how original! Name it after another hit sci-fi movie. Maybe it's all part of the comic book/cartoon series but I had to laugh at that. Also, laughable is this super evil decepticon is called ""the Fallen."" Really? That's the coolest name you could come up with with religious overtones?When you read the title, I expected ""the Fallen"" to stand for a group of decepticons. Nope.

And, I've seen Attack of the Clones. And for that matter, I've also seen Dune, Howard the Duck, The Never Ending Story and this much of Battlefield Earth. Not blockbusters, but they can join in on the fecalitous fun.And it's not that I have ever had a problem with Michael Bay. I very much enjoyed The Island, Armageddon and The Rock. Even Bad Boys 2, despite it's dialogue. I thought the first Transformers was awful until the last 20 minutes then Bay did his thing and well. Pearl Harbor was just Brandon, Dylan and Kelly going to Hawaii until they do a Top Gun inspired episode before going back to the Bermuda Love Triangle. It was also an excellent showcase for Josh Hartnett who managed to look like Tommy Lee Jones and sound like Keanu. Impressive, most can't do both. But I digress...Back to this, this, thing. The issue with Bay has never been that he agressively goes after the lowest common denominator, it's that the lowest common denominator is not near low enough for him. It's one thing to go after the Nascar crowd, it's another thing to try to appeal to them when they're drunk.And Sheia LaBarf? Man, Jim Belushi isn't this lucky! And Ms. Fox would have been a much lovelier presence, if you couldn't see Bay's fingerprints all over her so she can be positioned just so. And if she thought that was degrading and humiliating, what about the things she is made to say to this little muppet put in the hero role. Seriously, this guy's about as charasmatic as Jay Mohr and as about as manly as an Air Supply song.Then the ghettobots. Que pasta?

1164011,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B0019M5C0Q,Caleb Williams,"[1, 5]","The original Transformers movie is an ultimate favourite of mine and I was delighted when I first heard there was going to be a sequel and Bay was going to turn up the juice. Unfortunately, in comparison to the first movie, this fell flat in many ways and left me feeling a bit empty when leaving the theatre. The amount of Transformer characters in this movie is four times as many and they have a more prominent presence on Earth in terms of their co-operation with the government in tackling the Decepticon menace.The story is set two years after the original. More Autobots have come to Earth and formed a government alliance with the humans known as NEST which has the aim of eradicating the Decepticon presence on Earth. We see the return of our favourite Transformers and our favourite human characters such as Sam Witwicky (LaBouf), Mikaela (Fox), Major Lennox (Duhamel), Agent Simmons (Turturro) and Master Sergeant Epps (Gibson). This time the humans and Autobots face their biggest enemy to date as they have to tackle one of the original Transformers, from the Dynasty of Primes known as the Fallen.17,000 BC the Dynasty was on Earth and the Fallen wanted to harvest the sun which would provide Energons for the AllSpark. His fellow Primes disagreed with his plan as Earth was inhabited by humans so, in order to prevent him from starting the sun harvester destroying the planet, they sacrificed themselves and hid the Matrix of Leadership which powered the harvester. The Fallen vowed to take his revenge on Earth by finding the Matrix and starting up his sun harvester and destroying the humans. Now in the present, Sam Witwicky is going to college, Soundwave has joined the Decepticon forces by hacking into a government satellite to mobilise those who will help The Fallen achieve his revenge.On paper the plot sounds like it could work wonders and translate into one hell of a blockbuster extravaganza, however, what it translated to was a film that didn't seem to know where it was going and what it was trying to achieve. The human characters had to naturally take a step back in order to make way for the new and larger presence of the transformers, but what this meant is that the film makers still needed a reason to keep them around which ultimately, was ridiculous. The goofy humour is back but becomes way too childish for my liking. Bumblebee peeing on one of the Sector 7 agents in the first movie was pretty funny but, despite what imbeciles will tell you, dogs humping aren't. Sam's parents are also given a bigger and more annoying role as an attempt at some form of comic relief and also end up falling flat by destroying the plot line by breaking away from an important moment in the movie to see the parents being stupid.Talking about a lesser point of the human characters, although this is to make way for the higher level Transformer storyline, it does end up meaning you don't care what happens to any character. One of the more important people in the movie does get killed and I just found myself thinking ""who cares?"" which is something you don't want in a movie. The fighting in this sequel has been altered somewhat to get away from the confusion of the fight sequences of the first film. One of the better battle sequences pits Optimus against Megatron and Starscream. The look and set up for the battle is really well done and presents an exciting scene that presents the enjoyable aspect of this film.There's much more good and bad that I could talk about this movie, but I think it's best that you discover that for yourself. If you liked the first film then you will enjoy this but feel a bit dry coming out of it and there's the likelihood you will still prefer the first live action film. Character voicing is good, human acting is OK and the pacing and construction of the story is abysmal to say the least. When you blend them all together you are presented with a summer blockbuster that is just OK and nothing more than that. Judging by the fact that Michael seems to have learned from his mistakes of the first film, I'm hoping that if he does make this a trilogy, he manages to repair the numerous mistakes made by this one.",3,"A Great Blockbuster, But A Bit Too Goofy",1246492800,"07 2, 2009",2009,4179,"['original', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'ultimate', 'favourite', 'mine', 'was', 'delighted', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'sequel', 'Bay', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'up', 'juice', 'Unfortunately', 'comparison', 'first', 'movie', 'fell', 'flat', 'many', 'ways', 'left', 'feeling', 'bit', 'empty', 'when', 'leaving', 'theatre', 'amount', 'Transformer', 'characters', 'movie', 'four', 'times', 'many', 'have', 'more', 'prominent', 'presence', 'Earth', 'terms', 'co-operation', 'government', 'tackling', 'Decepticon', 'menace.The', 'story', 'set', 'two', 'years', 'original', 'More', 'Autobots', 'have', 'come', 'Earth', 'formed', 'government', 'alliance', 'humans', 'known', 'NEST', 'aim', 'eradicating', 'Decepticon', 'presence', 'Earth', 'see', 'return', 'favourite', 'Transformers', 'favourite', 'human', 'characters', 'such', 'Sam', 'Witwicky', 'LaBouf', 'Mikaela', 'Fox', 'Major', 'Lennox', 'Duhamel', 'Agent', 'Simmons', 'Turturro', 'Master', 'Sergeant', 'Epps', 'Gibson', 'time', 'humans', 'Autobots', 'face', 'biggest', 'enemy', 'date', 'have', 'tackle', 'one', 'original', 'Transformers', 'Dynasty', 'Primes', 'known', 'Fallen.17,000', 'BC', 'Dynasty', 'was', 'Earth', 'Fallen', 'wanted', 'harvest', 'sun', 'would', 'provide', 'Energons', 'AllSpark', 'fellow', 'Primes', 'disagreed', 'plan', 'Earth', 'was', 'inhabited', 'humans', 'so', 'order', 'prevent', 'starting', 'sun', 'harvester', 'destroying', 'planet', 'sacrificed', 'hid', 'Matrix', 'Leadership', 'powered', 'harvester', 'Fallen', 'vowed', 'take', 'revenge', 'Earth', 'finding', 'Matrix', 'starting', 'up', 'sun', 'harvester', 'destroying', 'humans', 'Now', 'present', 'Sam', 'Witwicky', 'going', 'college', 'Soundwave', 'joined', 'Decepticon', 'forces', 'hacking', 'government', 'satellite', 'mobilise', 'who', 'will', 'help', 'Fallen', 'achieve', 'revenge.On', 'paper', 'plot', 'could', 'work', 'wonders', 'translate', 'one', 'hell', 'blockbuster', 'extravaganza', 'however', 'what', 'translated', 'was', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'achieve', 'human', 'characters', 'had', 'naturally', 'take', 'step', 'back', 'order', 'make', 'way', 'new', 'larger', 'presence', 'transformers', 'what', 'meant', 'film', 'makers', 'still', 'needed', 'reason', 'keep', 'around', 'ultimately', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'goofy', 'humour', 'back', 'way', 'too', 'childish', 'liking', 'Bumblebee', 'peeing', 'one', 'Sector', '7', 'agents', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'what', 'imbeciles', 'will', 'tell', 'dogs', 'humping', 'are', ""n't"", 'Sam', 'parents', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'bigger', 'more', 'annoying', 'role', 'attempt', 'form', 'comic', 'relief', 'also', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'flat', 'destroying', 'plot', 'line', 'breaking', 'away', 'important', 'moment', 'movie', 'see', 'parents', 'being', 'stupid.Talking', 'lesser', 'point', 'human', 'characters', 'make', 'way', 'higher', 'level', 'Transformer', 'storyline', 'end', 'up', 'meaning', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'character', 'One', 'more', 'important', 'people', 'movie', 'get', 'killed', 'just', 'found', 'thinking', 'who', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'movie', 'fighting', 'sequel', 'been', 'altered', 'somewhat', 'get', 'away', 'confusion', 'fight', 'sequences', 'first', 'film', 'One', 'better', 'battle', 'pits', 'Optimus', 'Megatron', 'Starscream', 'look', 'set', 'up', 'battle', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'exciting', 'scene', 'enjoyable', 'aspect', 'much', 'more', 'good', 'bad', 'could', 'talk', 'movie', 'think', 'best', 'discover', 'liked', 'first', 'film', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'feel', 'bit', 'dry', 'coming', 'likelihood', 'will', 'still', 'prefer', 'first', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'Character', 'voicing', 'good', 'human', 'acting', 'OK', 'pacing', 'construction', 'story', 'abysmal', 'say', 'least', 'When', 'blend', 'together', 'are', 'presented', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'just', 'OK', 'nothing', 'more', 'Judging', 'fact', 'Michael', 'have', 'learned', 'mistakes', 'first', 'film', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'make', 'trilogy', 'repair', 'numerous', 'mistakes', 'made', 'one']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

Browsing around I found some interesting items and also I found Transformers 2. I never got a chance to see it at the movies, and me not being a big fan of the cartoons but a fan of its prequel I decided to purchase it since it was at that price. I already knew what many people and critics said about the film; when it hit the theaters I was disappointed to read all the negative appraisals from websites and people from work that viewed it.  Still I decided to give it an opportunity.The movie first of all definitely encloses what an action summer blockbuster should have: loud explosions, great special effects, nonstop action, good battle sequences; but unfortunately Michael Bay thought that the juvenile act on some autobots and decepticons and even including Sam's parents would enhance the film: the pointless gags, the `ghetto' slangs from the twins, their bothersome voices, leg humping (which I cannot blame since it was on Megan Fox -what a beauty-), showing off their testicles, and so forth. But beyond all those ridiculous happenings I found a movie that entertained me which was its principle.  In fact, the plot was more thought of than the original making you think that Michael Bay probably wanted to take the film to a different direction, but whoever thought of the entire lame jokes I stated literally killed what could have been a better movie.There is no essence to this movie that you should look forward to but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't see it.

That being said, I thought this installment was pretty good.  The first one is one of my favorites, which totally shocked me as I hadn't expected much. This one had too much sexual inuendo, the first film was softer on that score, which I liked much better.  Gutter type humor, in placed that didn't fit or was appropriate.  It did run longer then was necessary.  All in all, the story was ok, the acting good, Fox did a better job in the first film though.  They sexed her up over the top in this one...not a good idea.  This isn't a T&A; film, lose the idea. The action was tight and well paced.  There were spots where it slowed down, necessary I think.  Too much action all the time can really be taxing and turn people off. Enough drama; I thought the ""I love you"" subplot was REALLY subplot, you didn't really notice it as being annoying.  They are teenagers after all and saying I love you the first time is a tough thing, at any age really.I would recommend this to most people.

Plus the previews looked pretty spectacular.  But, great special effects hardly compensate for mediocre action sequences and inept storytelling.  This mega-budget clunker has too many moronic nuts and bolts to ever be considered much of a smooth thrill ride.I did like this slightly more than the original, but that's not saying much.  The plot here is pretty stagnant and unimaginative, but I wasn't expecting anything close to THE DARK KNIGHT.  But for some reason this weak story gets stretched to 2.5 hours, and it gets extremely tedious.There are some decent fight scenes, and the Decepticons do seem pretty formidable.  Partially this film seemed geared towards a family film, as there are no human casualties in battle.  But then for some reason they threw in plenty of unneccessary profanity just for some cheap laughs.  And some drug use?  Hardly meant for the younger crowd.Plus some other attempts at humor fall pretty flat.Another Big problem:Shia Lebouf--the dorkMegan Fox--the goddessBumblebee--the awesomest car/robot ever createdThe result--Lebarf leaves them for college and makes out with the first chick he meets?

His MTVish, everything looks like a commercial, hyperactive directing style caters to the lowest-common denominator of film-making. Everything he has ever done has been so over-the-top and ridiculous, I personally think it's embarassing that his movies make as much money as they do. He insults our intelligence by removing creativity and replacing it with mind-numbing, ""what the heck just happened"", ""that was ridiculous"" explosions.That being said, I enjoyed TRANSFORMERS (the first one). It seemed to me that Michael Bay had finally found a movie where he could be his arrogant over-the-top self and nobody would notice. I mean, how more over-the-top can you get than robots that transform into cars, boats, planes and whatever else they feel like.Yet, TRANSFORMERS 2: RISE OF THE FALLEN showed Bay's over-the-topness in a different way. The least of which is the ability to shoot some of the most unnecessarily sexist shots of Megan Fox I've ever seen in a movie. The first time we see Mikaela Banes (Fox), she's leaning forward on her motorcycle in her short short shorts for everybody to drool over. Look, I appreciate the beauty that is Megan Fox just like the next guy. She's smokin' hot, but that camera shot is hands down, the most unnecessary camera shot in the history of film. Sure, for a sex movie or Basic Instict or such, but not TRANSFORMERS, a movie that is based off of a popular set of toys, cartoons and is catered toward young people.On top of that, we have to witness the unnecessary hanging testicles of one robot and countless other unnecessary instances.Then of course there's the action sequences that are so fast and confusing it had me thinking of SPEED RACER and how the creators needed to just tone it down a notch. Wrestling matches between robots become just a pile of twisted metal. Just F/X rolling around on screen.The entire final sequence was so rapidly edited and over here, over there, over here again, over there, here's a new place, who's that, what side is that robot on? who just got blown up? oh, there's some giant robot testies, explosion here, explosion there, run there, run here... and it's over.I had actually started to find a small place of appreciation for Michael Bay after the first Transformers movie, but now he's right back in the cellar with me. Too bad though. This isn't a bad movie. There are a lot of funny, entertaining, well-constructed moments in RISE OF THE FALLEN, it was just a movie that was poorly handled by an arrogant director who thought he had to do way too much stuff.I wanted to give it 2 stars, but there is enough entertainment to make it a worthy watch. It just could have been so much more if Michael Bay had an ounce of tact in his repertoire.Less is more Bay.

1164021,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0019M5C0Q,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 10]","Michael Bay's ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is an aggressive, incomprehensible film that has no ambition other than to assault the senses with blinding special effects and a hell of a lot of noise. There's not a moment of entertainment to be found in any of its self-indulgent 150 minutes ... unless, of course, you find mindless action sequences and inconsequential plots entertaining. It follows the tradition of its equally God-awful predecessor by bombarding us with tangled images of destruction before pausing to be funny, although I use the term loosely since I never laughed, although I did smirk once at an outburst from one of the Transformer robots. I won't spoil it for you, seeing as there would no other reason to go see this film once you know what it is.The plot: Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is ready to go to college. Before he leaves, he discovers a broken piece of the cube from the first film, the one that can turn any inanimate object into a Transformer. Instantly, his mind is filled with bizarre symbols that somehow relate to the ongoing war between the Autobots and the Decepticons. Once he's in school, he occasionally has severe mental overloads, causing him to talk incoherently and write out all the symbols in his head. With the help of his techno-geek roommate, Leo Spitz (Ramon Rodriguez), and his girlfriend, Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), Sam tracks down the flustered Agent Simmons (John Turturro), who now works behind the counter of his mother's deli. Simmons has reason to believe that the Transformers have been among us for thousands of years.The Autobots, meanwhile, have since allied themselves with Earth armies to track down and destroy any Decepticons that have been in hiding. But it's a very shaky alliance, especially now that Decepticons are arriving from outer space and destroying major cities all over the world. A highly distrustful government official named Galloway (John Benjamin Hickey) seems to believe that they're only after the Autobots, not only because the remaining shard of the cube is under heavy lock and key, but also because the evil Megatron is slowly decaying at the bottom of the ocean. The leader of the Autobots, Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen), knows that Galloway is wrong and turns to Sam for help.Up in space, there awaits the malevolent Decepticon known only as The Fallen (voiced by Tony Todd), who, as the title suggests, wants revenge against Earth and the Autobots. Why? Who cares? Let's just leave it at this: If he didn't want revenge, there wouldn't be a movie.Back to Sam and his pals. They end up in the Egyptian desert for one reason or another and make a remarkable discovery in one of the three Pyramids. This, in turn, leads to the climactic battle between the Decepticons, Optimus Prime, and the American military. Funny how the Egyptian military (or any random Egyptian, for that matter) fails to notice that the Pyramids are being blown and smashed to smithereens. No matter; we're only supposed to pay attention to the action, and boy, is there a lot of it. I will say that I kind of liked the Transformer that used its mouth as a gigantic vacuum cleaner, sucking up sand as if it lived off of the stuff. Naturally, its throat is nothing more than a series of metal gears meant to grind whatever it sucks up into fine fragments.But wait--I haven't even gotten to the ""funny"" parts yet. In the course of this movie, we see a mini Transformer ravishing Mikaela's leg like a dog, Sam's beloved Bumblebee Camero SS crying at the thought of being abandoned, and Sam's mother (Julie White) accidentally eating a marijuana-laced brownie, after which she acts like a reject from a vaudeville slapstick routine. As if this weren't bad enough, two Transformers in particular cross the fine line between satire and insensitivity; disguised as a pair of compact hatchbacks, twins Skids and Mudflap (voiced by Tom Kenny and Reno Wilson) constantly argue with each other using slang-heavy ghetto street talk. The filmmakers take the stereotype one step further by giving one of them a gold tooth. This isn't funny. It's not even mildly amusing. It wouldn't be appropriate in any movie, let alone the sequel to ""Transformers.""I enjoy escapist entertainment as much as the next person. But my God, something went horribly wrong when Michael Bay decided to make two films based on action figures. ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is such a miserable experience, so loud, so visually unappealing, so terrible at finding a balance between action and humor. The story is jam-packed, but not with anything of interest or value. Absolutely nothing about the plot sinks in; it's a two and a half-hour exercise in storytelling without actually telling a story. The next time I want that kind of experience, I'll read a book with the TV on while playing a CD of exploding sound effects on my stereo system. I'll make sure to turn the subwoofer all the way up, because goodness knows feeling the sounds is just as important as hearing them.",2,These Machines Have a Serious Glitch,1246060800,"06 27,

So I am going to stick to my ""good/bad/summary"" approach.On the good side, I thought this movie had a lot more depth than the previous Transformers movie (which was much more a shallow movie for fans).  It is still not a deep movie, but it poses some material that can actually be food for thought.On the negative side, I there were a number of things that REALLY bugged me about the movie and made it downright cheesy.  Having Optimus Prime spit out teeth during the fight is just wrong on so many levels.  Similarly the college scenes were extraordinarily cheesy by any standard.If this is a movie just made for fans, I suppose I would have to say it doesn't measure up.  I think it was an attempt at something more, but where neither the director nor the screenwriter had any idea what that ""something more"" was supposed to be.

1164027,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B0019M5C0Q,Craig Whittle,"[0, 1]","TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLENSTARRING: Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Ramon Rodriguez, Kevin Dunn, Julie White, Isabel Lucas, Rainn Wilson, Glenn Morshower and the voices of: Hugo Weaving, Tony Todd, Peter Cullen, Reno Wilson, Robert Foxworth and Jess HarnellWRITTEN BY: Ehren Kruger, Roberto Orci and Alex KurtzmanDIRECTED BY: Michael BayRated: PG-13Genre: Action / Science FictionRelease Date: 24 June 2009Let me start off by saying that no-one is a bigger Michael Bay fan than I am, because this is going to get ugly and I want everyone to know that he is an amazing director. He just had this one slip up and it's called Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.I have stood behind Bay on every one of his previous films including Armageddon and Pearl Harbor which I thought were amazing and have gotten so much criticism. Bay is notorious for putting things in his movies that would never happen in real life and when called out on it he will flat out admit to it. He likes to push the envelope of reality in order to make something look cool. But you can't blame him entirely because he knows his audience better than perhaps any director in Hollywood. You need only to look at the billions of dollars his films have grossed to see that. He knows what Middle America wants to see. Several people have told me that this movie was incredible and that they loved it and that it was better than the first one. I disagree entirely but there are so many people out there that just want to be visually entertained for two plus hours and take away nothing else from the film. I have had people tell me that they like to watch bright and shiny things go bang on the screen. If this is what you are looking for in a film, then Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is for you. Now on with the bashing.The film opened very weak in comparison to Transformers. Optimus Prime's voice seemed dull and not as adventurous as it did when we first met him. Maybe he had already seen the movie when they had him narrate it.I have heard rumors that Bay shot all of the action and CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery) sequences months before there was even a script and then had the writers generate the rest of the story around those scenes. Is it true? Not sure.I've got to tell you however, watching the film it looks like that's exactly what happened. And the writers are all very talented. He brought back the two who wrote the first film as well as another writer who has an incredible list of successful screenplays under his belt to include, Arlington Road and Reindeer Games just to name a few. And the two writers who wrote the first film also wrote the new Star Trek and Mission Impossible III. So you have to ask, how did this film get so horribly screwed up? Where was the witty dialogue and perfect comedic timing that the first film was engulfed with? Where was the cool story and plot and character development scenes? Who knows what happened.I will say that it is filled with awesome action sequences and should undoubtedly win an Oscar for best special effects and at the very least be nominated for Oscars in sound and sound effects editing. But I feel like that's all the film had to offer and I'm sorry but that's just not enough. I don't care if it's just an action movie. It's because I'm such a huge fan of Michael Bay that I'm this disappointed. Luckily he promises to put more effort into the script of the third film.The plot is nearly impossible to explain. It's everywhere all at once. Apparently the Transformers have been here for thousands of years and the leader of the bad guys (Decepticons), called The Fallen, was imprisoned in space. It makes you wonder if they called him The Fallen before he fell or if it's just been so long that perhaps they just forgot his real name. Anyhow, his buddies send Transformers out on missions to gather intelligence from our Military bases that apparently don't have very good security at all. They soon discover that Sam (Shia LaBeouf) has a shard of the cube left from the first film.We learn that Sam is off to college without his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). I am amazed that this girl even made it into Hollywood. Next to Paris Hilton, she has to be the worst actress out there. I understand that she is attractive physically and that nine out of 10 guys would love to sleep with her. So many guys tell me ""She's hot dude."" So what if she's hot, she's a terrible actress! This is a huge movie and there are plenty of actresses who are 'hot' and can actually act! Hopefully her character will die early in the third film.Sam is talking on the phone with her using very cheesy dialogue that is obviously pushing toward what is going to happen next, when a piece of the cube drops from the pocket of the sweatshirt he was wearing at his first Transformers encounter. He explains that he hasn't washed it because it's his lucky shirt, as lame as that is, thank God Shia LaBeouf is a great actor so it's tolerable. But then he drops the shard of the cube and it burns through the floor and the ceiling of the floor below and lands on a countertop and somehow can't melt through that. Then all of the metallic common household appliances come to life. They transform, so I guess we are supposed to believe that they are Transformers? But the Transformers are aliens so did the Witwickeys purchase all of their appliances from Mars? A huge firefight ensues and Sam is rescued by his Camaro that Transforms into Bumblebee.Immediately following this scene, Sam tells Bumblebee he's leaving him at home because he is no longer in danger. I guess Sam must have suffered amnesia to not remember that he was just attacked by several little Transformers. And what kid in their right mind would leave behind a brand new Camaro, let alone one that's a Transformer?Bay also shows Mikaela sitting on a motorcycle wearing the skimpiest outfit imaginable in a very provocative pose at her father's body shop. Maybe her dad was at lunch when she struck this unnatural pose? We also get to see Mikaela change her outfit to say goodbye to Sam which is really an excuse to just see her change her outfit. And then it isn't shown to us how exactly Mikaela ends up with the shard of the cube and later in the film Sam actually asks her if she has it, but she takes it with her and where does she put it? She brings it to the body shop which is comprised entirely of metal objects and not one of them turns into a Transformer, like Sam's appliances did. How does that add up?This film doesn't know what kind of film it wants to be. At one moment it is filled with vulgarity, intense violence sequences, it shows two male dogs having sex with each other and Sam's mom even samples pot-filled brownies at his college and has some amusing side effects. While I was not offended by any of these moments in the film, I know that several parents were.Then on the other hand, it is filled with all kinds of lame child-related humor as well. A lot of the Transformers are real slap-stick characters like the twins who I found to be annoying in every scene and the little voices that some of them have. A lot of the dialogue by the Transformers is child-like in nature as well. There's even a Transformer that is so old he has a beard made out of metallic shards and uses a piece of his body as a cane to get around. Come on, seriously?He's a great actor, but they used the same guy that played the Colonel in the first film, (Glenn Morshower) to play a Four Star General in this one. He is working with the good Transformers (Auto Bots) in a special military unit. For some reason, despite the fact he is in charge of the project, he is allowed by a Major to speak with Optimus Prime, but can't see him directly. And Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel) knows way more about the project than the General. So much in fact that he doesn't feel the need to call the General, Sir when speaking to him and is aware that the President has appointed a new civilian in charge of Commanding the Auto Bots. The General actually says, ""I guess I didn't get that memo."" I was in the military folks and I'm here to tell you that a Major would damn sure refer to a Four Star General as Sir or General and would have no knowledge of information regarding the President and his chief of Staff that the General would not. Wow.Sam and Mikaela meet up with a really irritating kid who is supposed to be a comic relief that is Sam's roommate in college and the always funny and enjoyable John Turturro's character Simmons. They all set out to gain information from the very old Transformer mentioned previously. They are then transported by him miraculously to the pyramids in Egypt where the secret to their salvation is believed to be and the third act takes place. I glanced at the clock on my DVD player when watching this for the second time and the final action sequence was well over 30 minutes of non-stop action. Given the special effects were amazing and it was very fun to watch, it was just too much. It just kept going and going and going. It was about as relenting as watching a couple of kids play with the Transformers toys for over half an hour.The Decepticons previous to all of this had captured Sam's parents who bring so much to the film. They really are hilarious and believable characters played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White. I guess the Decepticons had kidnapped them in hopes of trapping Sam in Egypt, but then they are just set loose. Maybe the Decepticons forgot about them due to the chaos of the rigorous 30 plus minute climax?There are two huge moments in the film that were beyond the lamest of the lame. It's almost like everyone at the pitch meeting was yelling out ideas and then someone said, ""Hey, let's just use all of them!"" and then everyone agreed. Not to give too much away, one involves an idea that's been recycled a million times and takes place at Sam's dorm room with a pretty girl. How random was that? Once it's over it's never mentioned again. The second is Sam's destiny that's carried out at the climax. Why did he have to be the one to do this? A toddler could have been just as effective. After all of the other confusing and ridiculous moments in the film though, several of which I didn't even mention, these seem to fit with the rest pretty well.",2,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

This movie was excellent and masterful from the epic cgi robots to the fun plot of world destruction from a old menace. The movie picks up two years after the first one and whisks us away to a brand new story of the oldest foe (voiced by Tony Todd) who is interested in destroying the world and it's up to Optimus Prime and the human and robot race (Including Shea Lebouf and Megan Fox who obviously are in for a wild ride) to save the world. When i saw this in theaters, it nearly blew my mind away with the sound(which shouldve won the oscar) and what was happening on screen. Take my word for it people.

1164033,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B0019M5C0Q,DarthRad,"[54, 81]","The first Transformers movie was great!  And the second?Bigger, longer, louder, more robots, more action, more Megan Fox, more CGI ... so how can you end up with a worse movie than the original?Well, it happened, as Michael Bay definitely went out of control here.  What are the problems with this movie?Characters - When John Turturro returns and actually becomes one of the more sympathetic characters in the movie, that tells you just how packed the script is with truly annoying characters.  Ramon Rodriguez led the list for Character-Who-I-Most-Wanted-to-See-Gutted-By-Megatron.  Isabel Lucas, the supposed Aussie hottie and rival to Megan Fox, was OMG some wierd orange shade of tan... NOT attractive,  gross, really.  Skids and Mudflap... WTF?  Oh yeah, for sure there were strong racist overtones here in their jive-talking and monkey-ghetto appearance, but what was worse was that they were just sooooo Jar-Jar Binks acid-on-the-nerves annoying.The list of characters in the ""Needs To Be Killed by Megatron Real Soon"" category is just too long for this movie to be enjoyable.Robots, you want more giant robots?  Way too many giant robots - couldn't hardly tell who was who in all the fighting, couldn't even see what all the fighting moves were... lots of robot deathblows, the CGI was great, but the images were so densely packed with detail that they blurred in the mind - way, way Too Much Information!!!  Can we get subtitles for the action sequences on the DVD/Blu-Ray?More TMI - was it me, or did the dialogue sound compressed and speeded up?  Several times, it sounded like Sam and Mikaela were talking to each other at Fedex speeds - no they didn't sound like chipmunks, but it is possible  to speed up the soundtrack and lower the tonal frequencies to normal.  Maybe this was the only way Michael Bay could get the movie to come in at only 2-1/2 hours instead of four hours.Plot... well, seriously, after all the critics decrying the lack of any plot in this movie, I came away thinking that this problem with the movie was way overblown compared to all of its other problems.  I don't know about you, but I didn't come into this movie expecting any plot.  This is after all a movie about giant robots fighting each other.But somehow or another, in the first movie, we were made to care more about these robots, and about the humans they were fighting over.  That was what made the first Transformers so enjoyable.  All of that went out the window in this movie.  As you sit through this very long second movie in the Transformers franchise, you begin to wish that Megatron could hurry up and gut everybody in the movie.......Except for Megan Fox of course.  Fox manages to appear even more lovely in this film than the first, the only thing improved from the first movie...Overall, though, by piling in an excess of almost everything except sympathetic characters into this movie, Michael Bay has made this movie into an example of information overload, and it becomes just a tedious exercise for the eyes.",1,Disappointing doesn't quite express the problems with this movie,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,3025,"['first', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'second', 'Bigger', 'longer', 'louder', 'more', 'robots', 'more', 'action', 'more', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'more', 'CGI', 'so', 'how', 'can', 'end', 'up', 'worse', 'movie', 'original', 'Well', 'happened', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'definitely', 'went', 'control', 'here', 'What', 'are', 'problems', 'movie', 'Characters', 'When', 'John', 'Turturro', 'returns', 'actually', 'one', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'movie', 'just', 'how', 'packed', 'script', 'truly', 'annoying', 'characters', 'Ramon', 'Rodriguez', 'led', 'list', 'Character-Who-I-Most-Wanted-to-See-Gutted-By-Megatron', 'Isabel', 'Lucas', 'supposed', 'Aussie', 'hottie', 'rival', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'was', 'OMG', 'wierd', 'orange', 'shade', 'tan', 'NOT', 'attractive', 'gross', 'really', 'Skids', 'Mudflap', 'WTF', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'sure', 'were', 'strong', 'racist', 'overtones', 'here', 'jive-talking', 'monkey-ghetto', 'appearance', 'what', 'was', 'worse', 'was', 'were', 'just', 'sooooo', 'Jar-Jar', 'Binks', 'acid-on-the-nerves', 'annoying.The', 'list', 'characters', 'Needs', 'Be', 'Killed', 'Megatron', 'Real', 'Soon', 'category', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'movie', 'be', 'enjoyable.Robots', 'want', 'more', 'giant', 'robots', 'Way', 'too', 'many', 'giant', 'robots', 'could', ""n't"", 'hardly', 'tell', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'fighting', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'what', 'fighting', 'moves', 'were', 'lots', 'robot', 'deathblows', 'CGI', 'was', 'great', 'images', 'were', 'so', 'densely', 'packed', 'detail', 'blurred', 'mind', 'way', 'way', 'Too', 'Much', 'Information', 'Can', 'get', 'subtitles', 'action', 'sequences', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'More', 'TMI', 'was', 'did', 'dialogue', 'sound', 'compressed', 'speeded', 'up', 'Several', 'times', 'sounded', 'Sam', 'Mikaela', 'were', 'talking', 'other', 'Fedex', 'speeds', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'chipmunks', 'possible', 'speed', 'up', 'soundtrack', 'lower', 'tonal', 'frequencies', 'normal', 'Maybe', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'could', 'get', 'movie', 'come', 'only', '2-1/2', 'hours', 'instead', 'four', 'hours.Plot', 'well', 'seriously', 'critics', 'decrying', 'lack', 'plot', 'movie', 'came', 'away', 'thinking', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'overblown', 'compared', 'other', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'movie', 'expecting', 'plot', 'movie', 'giant', 'robots', 'fighting', 'other.But', 'somehow', 'first', 'movie', 'were', 'made', 'care', 'more', 'robots', 'humans', 'were', 'fighting', 'over', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'Transformers', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'went', 'out', 'window', 'movie', 'sit', 'very', 'long', 'second', 'movie', 'Transformers', 'franchise', 'begin', 'wish', 'Megatron', 'could', 'hurry', 'up', 'gut', 'everybody', 'movie', '.Except', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'course', 'Fox', 'appear', 'even', 'more', 'lovely', 'film', 'first', 'only', 'thing', 'improved', 'first', 'movie', 'Overall', 'though', 'piling', 'excess', 'almost', 'everything', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'made', 'movie', 'example', 'information', 'overload', 'just', 'tedious', 'exercise', 'eyes']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

I can watch an action film, turn my mind off and enjoy the explosions. For these types of film Michael Bay usually delivers and to a degree the first Transformers did. With Revenge of the Fallen he attempts to continue the story, upping the ante with a vast array of larger robots, bigger stakes and more scantily dressed ladies. Unfortunately in super-sizing these aspects others became watered down.The story is non existent. The Decipticons are back and they want our sun for energy. It's that simple. Sam (Shia Labeouf) moves from pointless encounter to encounter without progressing the character or the plot. Megan Fox has little impact beyond being eye candy. Other secondary characters are of little importance and rehash their same old ideas.What really disappointed me was the opportunity to expand the existing Transformer characters and that doesn't happen, at all. I believe Optimus Prime shares one scene with Sam and only Bumblebee really returns. A wasted opportunity. In their place are a couple of `comedy' bots in the style of gangster wanabees. Cringeworthy at every moment. The action also suffers. It has become more disjointed, hard to watch and understand the geography of the scenes. Someone explain less is more to Bay please.With all these criticisms it may sound like I hate this movie. Far from it. I'm always happy to see an exploding robot, it looks expensive and Shia's Sam is always interesting to watch.I would recommend this as a Saturday night movie when little else is on.

They would only destroy Suns of solar systems where there was no life. But one of the Primes, lands on Earth and wants to destroy our Sun, killing everything. The other primes cast him out and he is sent into exile, now known as the Fallen.Sam is leaving for college, and is busy trying to keep his relationship with Mikaela alive via webcam and phone calls. He also tries to send his Autobot protector, Bumblebee, back to join Optimus Prime and the other Autobots. Optimus and his team, along with the soldiers from the first film, are traveling the world and destroying the Decepticons which have gone into hiding. In China, Optimus learns that the Fallen is going to return.Sam finds a piece of the Cube from the first film and when touched it activates, turning all of the Witwicky appliances into Decepticons. By touching the Cube shard, Sam also begins to suffer from visions. Sam turns to the Autobots to help him figure out what the visions mean, and must help them stop the Fallen from returning.Michael Bay really amped up everything for this movie. The action is non-stop, the visuals are stunning, the CGI is jaw-dropping, and there are quite a few laughs throughout. The humor is very crude, but pretty funny. Megan Fox and Isabel Lucas look stunning, and while there is no actual nudity in the film, there are a few scenes which push the sexuality presented in the film up a few notches, so parents with pre-teens may not want to throw this on for family fun night.The only real issue I had with the film is the running time. At 149 minutes, this film simply runs too long. There are multiple scenes that could've ended up on the cutting room floor, and it wouldn't have hurt the narrative at all.

1164040,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B0019M5C0Q,David J. Brown,"[7, 12]","First, let me say that I enjoyed the first film.  It was nothing great and it will be forgotten by anyone who is a real film fan in less then five years, but it was fun and some of the visuals were genuinely exciting and unique.  I don't care about the original cartoon show.  I thought it was boring and lame when I was six and in my older age it's down right intolerable and obviously an ingenious extended commercial for a toy line.  That's it.  The mythology, characters and plots aren't worth talking about or remembering.  I was thankful that the first film only retained the only cool element of the concept which was cars and machines instantly transforming into giant robots, no matter how illogical.  That's it!While the first film kept the first act down and simple with suburban comedy, high school loser hijinks and military conflict seemingly based in some reality with the fantastic element of giant robots, the sequel just piles on loud, ugly and confusing imagery and action with lame and foreced jokes.  I enjoyed the humorous elements of the first film.  It helped take some of the edge off the story which is totally stupid to begin with.  Taking it too serious would have made the film more funny then I think the creators would've intended.  There is nothing memorable about this film.  The plot is not only uninteresting, it never really makes sense and it's not even an inch compelling.  Sure, this film has some moments that are entertaining, but they are mild and one of them involves a small robot humping Megan Foxx's leg!  That's it.  So, that tells you the heights this film strives for.Special effects, the real reason anyone would even mildy care about this film.  Are they good?  I guess so.  They are basically the same as the first, but there's more of them.  Great.  The spectacle of the first film's robots is gone, gone two years ago.  This film doesn't offer anything new regarding visuals.  We get some new robots of course, but their designs aren't fun or interesting.  Plus, we get robots with personalities in more abundance this time, but again I say that mildly.  A pair of twins speak fluent 'hip-hop'.  Right.  Of course an ancient species of robot new to earth would talk like the type of idiots you see hanging out at the food court in the mall.  How innovative.  Oh, and the 'leg humping' robot talks like he's straight out of Brooklyn, of course.  I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, John Tuturro provides its voice and it sounds similar to the one he did for the film Monkeybone.  Oh, and one is British, he's old and wise, so of course he's British!  This is pure mind rot and it's unfortunate that this British robot is the only CGI character of any interest.Now onto the humans.  Ummm...wait, there are no humans in this film!  Not one recognizable human trait to be found among the many human denizens in this film, AND the humans are more interesting in this film then the robots!  Megan Fox should've got billing along with her endless supply of glycerine(filmmakers use it to make actors look sweaty in movies).  Bay is in love with the mere image of Fox, and why not, she's completely hot, but it is so escessive and gratuitous I was embarrassed to be watching it.  Her opening shot would make a great still photo in Maxim but in a film where she is supposed to be a real person it's really stupid!  Lebouf is a real pro with the comic beats.  Hew fumbles and reacts in fun and real ways, but his character's arch involves him not being able to tell his two year long girlfriend that he loves her and it is really straight out of a sitcom and holds no dramatic interest or weight.  It's lame and cheap.  Oh, and then there's  the parents.  They were a funny part of the original film so I guess Bay decided that it worked so well that he would over-do it this time.  Again, no real humanity just sitcom hijinks.  Why is there a scene in this film involving the mom losing her mind after eating a pot brownie at her son's new college campus?  It's lame and tired and totally besides the point.  Even moreso when the main plot has nothing to do with the college experience, unlike in the first film where the idea of your first car and big spectacle in suburbia was used as a great juxtaposition.  Hell, at least the parents were memorable if not believable in this film.John Tuturro comes back from the original and manages to deliver his awful dialogue with some tact, but again, nothing remotely human in this character.  In the last film he was sort of exposition/comic relief but here he is a main player and unfortunately the way the character is composed you realize how little interest he really holds.  Good thing they got a really talented and pro actor for this, or would've been unbearable.Excessive is the best way to describe this sequel, and you expect a sequel to give more of the same but bigger, but this film just repeatedly bashes you over the head and it becomes numbing and worse, unpleasant.  Why would someone think constant loud noises and explosions and robots punching each other for two and half hours is entertaining?  Aren't action films supposed to have a flow, a build of momentum?  It's just constant in-your face action with no purpose and no drama, and action that doesn't involve characters you care about, especially the robots for which the film is titlted after.  In big dumb summer films I need either two things, or both if I'm lucky: interesting characters or an intriguing plot.  This film has neither.  If you want to experience what this film has do this; punch you self in the face, sit under a giant ringing bell while listening to a recording of someone screaming.There are some good moments in the film, very few.  The battle that leads to Optimus Prime's 'death' is fun and what I paid to see.  The same goes for the opening action scene.  Once they pass I thought the film would start going to new places but rather settled to do those two scenes in different locations over, and over, and over, and over, and over again for almost three hours!  Why is this film two and half hours long?  Why?  At an hour and half at least it would've been mildly diverting and a fairly pleasureable experience at the movies.Michael Bay is not a brilliant director.  He is a brilliant still-photoagrapher, brilliant 2nd unit action director, brilliant special visual and practical effects supervisor, and a good cinematographer.  In these jobs he would be a great asset to any more talented director.  I'm no hater of Bay either.  His film The Rock was very good, though a lot of credit must go to Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery and Ed Harris for that one, and I thought he was improving at telling stories with the last Transformers and The Island.  Both films were fun and well told and had some spectacular sequences worth remembering, but with Transformers: Rise of the Fallen he seems to be regressing back to Bad Boys II territory, and that was one of the most overly-long, mind numbing, boring, excessive, totally awful films I ever saw.  Maybe it should be a rule that Bay can't do anymore sequels to his own films.I still have faith in the movie going public.  I know this film will do really well in the first two weeks or so, but I don't think it will do as well as the first film and I hope return receipts drop after the first few weeks.  I'm not sure I want to meet a person who claims they like movies and thought this film was good or entertaining on any level.  How mind numb, stupid and dull does one have to be to like this film?  I know I'm being harsh, but when you have morons on this site claiming that people are too hard on films like this and Wolverine and us harsh critics go into these films wanting hate them, really are the low bar setters that are ruining films.  I don't pay hard earned money hoping a movie will suck so I can get-off complaining on the internet!  That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard!  I had no expectations for this film beyond just being entertained for a few hours.  It wasn't entertaining to me and that's it.  Maybe those who say these things should raise thier expectations or maybe see real summer films like the original Star Wars, Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Missions: Impossible, new Bond films, Aliens, The Dark Knight or any of the various Pixar films.  I'm happy for you if you like this film, but at the same time you really scare and worry me.  Also, maybe you folks can tell me why alien robots with massive and super-hi-tech technology wuld fight each other using their fists or arm daggers?  What a waste of time!  Don't they have lazer guns or something?  Why, oh why, after countless rounds from the last film and in this film, would the military continue to shoot bullets at these alien robots?  It's obvious they have little to no effect on them!  AAAAGGGHHH!!!PS: This awful new Transformers film has gotten much valid critcisms but there is one that I don't agree with--some claim that the hip-hop personalities of the twin robots is racist against black people.  NO.  The robots are pink and green, not black.  In my life I've seen many white, Asian and even Indian folks with hip-hip slang, gold teeth and big ears.  Go to the mall, go to L.A. or go to New York City, and you'll see what I mean.  If you see racism or black stereotypes then you might be the racist.  Just a thought.",2,I think this film might just represent everything wrong with big Hollywood movies!,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,9359,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'film', 'was',

Here are few reasons why I think so:1.  Script is horrible. They just decided to make a second movie for the sake of making more money and did not really care about the point or a story of which there is none.2.  If you have not seen the first movie, don't even bother because it is not made for you.3.  Fight sequence is also confusing given that you really can't tell who is destroying who.4.  Knowing that you can not just have 2.5 hours of explosions, between fight sequences we have the most ridiculous dialog I have ever heard in a movie, therefore you have 15 minute time blocks which should used for more important tasks such as pulling your hair out one at a time.5.  Acting (or better over-acting) is some of the worst you will ever see. Given that there was NOTHING of value to say, director asked everyone to just speak louder and look more stressed for no reason.6.  Clearly attempt was made to make this funny. THEY FAILED. This movie is NOT FUNNY. Inappropriate and vulgar 1 liners should not be sold as humor. They are actually offensive.There are so many more I can list, but writing this means I have to think about the movie which is making me angry again. Who can I file a lawsuit against to get 2.5 hours of my life back?

Infect I  do  have  memories  from  seeing  this  movie  when  it  was  shown  at  the  drive  inn  2  summers  ago. It  was  a  late  Monday  afternoon  like  around  6:00  pm  and  the  sun  was  still  out. My  parents  were  out  of  town  that  evening  and  I  did  not  have  to  work  the  next  day. So  I  decided  to  see  a  movie  that  night. The  movie  I  wanted  to  see  that  night  was  Transformers  2. Insted  of  seeing  it  at  regular movie  theather. I  decided  to  see  this  at  a  drive  inn  movie  theather,  because  I  thought  it  would  be  more  fun  and  worth  it. So  I  grabed  my  pillow  off  my  bed  and  some  snacks, and  my  public  enemies book  to  read  until the  movie  started  and  was  on  my  way  to  the  drive  inn. With  the  theather  about  45  minutes  from  where  I  live  and  it  did  not  start  until  8:45  after  dark. I  also  decided  to  pick  up  a  pizza  at  Pappa  John  on  the  way.  So when  I  got  to  the  drive  inn, I  told  the  lady  at  the  ticket  booth  that  this  is  going  to  be  the  sweetest  movie  to  watch  here. So  I  enter  the  parking  lote  and  parked  next  to  a  speaker  to  place  on  my  front  seat  window  and  I  turned  on  my  car  stero  to  the  station  the  movie  was  playing. I  do  drive  a  2003  Chevy  red  tracker. I  was  also  parked  in  the  front  row  infront  of  the  screen  and  in  the  middle  of  the  role. I  even  told  a  bunch  of  20  year  olds  in  truck  parked  next  me  are  you  ready  to  be  blown  away  because  this  is  going  to  be  the  sweetest  movie  ever. So  it  got  dark  and  the  movie  started. You  all  know  that  Mega  tron  in  a  car,  So  picture  that  the  mega  Tron  is  your  car  when  he  starts  speaking  on  to  your  car  stero.

The Autobots and Decepticons continue their civil war on Earth. The Decepticons are searching for the Matrix of Leadership, a tool which can be used to harvest energy to recreate Cybertron in their own image. The Autobots have allied themselves with N.E.S.T, an international group of human soldiers dedicated to protecting Earth from the Decepticons. When The Fallen, one of the original 13 Transformers, revives Megatron and sends him to capture Sam Whitwiky (Shia LeBouf), the Autobots and Decepticons battle for control. The film delivers on a truly epic scale with lots of Robots fighting, explosions and a worthy adventure. This movie assaults the mind on several levels, but is easy to follow.

Everything clicked in the first one. I thought the follow up would be just as good and was I ever wrong.Revenge of the Fallen was just that a character called the Fallen is introduced as Megatron's master & decides now is the time to take over.They missed the target on this one. Too much toilet, bathroom and pointless vulgar language and humor to start off..characters that were just plain stupid...Autobots that had no name and had ghetto humor.Robots that were not even part of the TV series...boy what went wrong here (everything basically)...I cant believe just how bad this was..Fallen is the key word...Fallen from the great heights from the first picture to this lousy sequel.I have no idea what made Michael Bay decide to go for bathroom humor, closeups of a man's fatty butt, a character walking around with his pants down , endless scenes of Megan Fox' boobie cleavage, and a pointless ""I love you"" subplot that went nowhere at all. I mean really, if you love someone tell them - don't play the battle of wills. Is that how Bay sees relationships - who gives in to who ? Do you wait until someone dies until you say 'I love you I need you' and endless pour your heart out dribble ? Bleck !!This was also overlong running at 2 1/2 hours with endless scenes of the cast running around Egypt looking for signs to find the Matrix of Leadership (which in the cartoon Optimus already has this in his chest) I was waiting for a Transformer Mummy to come out. Take the worst out of the Mummy Series and National Treasure & National Lampoon them with robots and this is what you get..The action was okay - good, but explosions , SPFX , more robots with 'cool' (uncool) dialog do not replace a movie filled with holes, lousy toilet humor and just utter tedium in Egypt....On top of that Rainn Wilsons parents were everything out of a nightmare. What kind of parents are these two ? Who came up with their asinine lines. The mother was just horrible with her dialog. And they kept popping up out of nowhere as did characters - just popping up out of nowhere, half the time I was asking where did this person come from...this made me want to watch the cartoon which at least were classier than this and had a more serious tone than this..As much as I like Transformers & being a fan for over 2 decades this movie was a car wreck..this would make a great Rifftrax or Cinematic Titanic title (for those who are MST3K fans)It really was that bad, and yet, you really want to root for Optimus Prime, you want to like him, but the film wont let you. Or you will like Prime but nothing else.I know Transformers 3 is in the works..I hope Michael Bay & company decide to re-watch the first one to see that formula.For those that did like it and want to own it , the 2 disc is the way to go as it has all the bonus features.

1164056,A8B3WBWEI3TVG,B0019M5C0Q,"E. Ambrose ""Fellshot""","[1, 6]","Stuff like this makes me grateful that Rifftrax were made available to the public.So this move can be summed up as thus: Twilight for guys.Rather than terrible romance, we get Explosions! Lots of explosions! Lots of running and screaming!  Talking very quickly! *sigh* I was asking if the movie was over twenty minutes in.So, this film also rather obviously lacks a plot of any sort. There's something about a key and decepti-whatnots winning if it falls into their hands... and that's about all I got in between the explosions. There are absolutely no original, sympathetic, interesting or snarky characters. Actually, I don't think there are any actual characters at all. Just terrible cliches and  some of the worst racial stereotypes I've ever seen in recent film. I don't remember any character names at all. They were that forgettable.Well since I've mentioned it a few times, I might as well address the main portion of the film: explosions and robot fight scenes.Now I like a good explosion as much as the next person. I can snicker with glee as well as any Mythbuster whilst contemplating blowing up some random inanimate object (for science!). However, I appreciate explosions more when there is some context put around them besides ""I shot a rocket at it."" Speaking of rockets,  what idiot fires bullets at machinery when there are rocket launchers available? A shoulder mounted rocket launcher is used exactly one time in the entire two and half hours of the film. This seems more than a little silly to me.Then the fight scenes... oh the fight scenes. I like a good robot fight scene. I love Macross and its mecha. I love the bot fights in Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Those are well animated, well choreographed, put in context and fun to watch. Revenge of the Fallen's robot fight scenes were not fun to watch. They look like someone shot two Erector sets at each other from air cannons and filmed the resulting impact. While Freud would likely say that I was right on target with the example, visually these scenes were not helped by a low contrast between robots versus robots and robots and the background.

1164057,A2LY87A30IOYNX,B0019M5C0Q,ecclesial hypostasis,"[4, 7]","There is a fundamental difference between popular art and 'high' art. High art offers up complex and challenging concepts and execution, only able to be appreciated by those with a developed aesthetic sense. Popular art offers simple and accessible material that can be appreciated by anyone, because it works with established conventions and techniques. But it can still be a richly rewarding experience. Cinema is one of the great purveyors of popular culture in our society, and many Hollywood films are remarkable examples of this craft. Not this one.I give this preface because the standard defense of this film is its low-brow nature. Transformers 2 is meant to be a 'mindless action flick'. I enjoy action films that do not tax the brain very much. But apparently this has been misconstrued by the makers of this film to mean that they have license to be mindless themselves while making it. And apparently heartless too.This is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. With every passing scene it sank below the lowest expectations that I had for its quality. The plot was entirely incoherent. The acting was laughable, and the younger women completely exploited for their appearance. The premises of the Transformers universe were violated or disregarded in completely unnecessary ways (apparently they can assume human form?). Every attempt at humour went for the absolute lowest common denominator of tasteless sexual or racially-based jokes, and scenes which called for some genuine emotion were unintentionally funny (robot heaven?). The much-vaunted special effects produced scenes that were almost impossible to follow due to the lack of differentiation between the robots. The film is also far too long and completely uninvolving - I found myself yawning with boredom by the time we arrived at the supposed 'climax' of the film and during its most intense action sequences.Yet this is one of the most commercially successful films of all time. I think we need to collectively meditate on this and what it means for our culture.

The movie was never intended to be a masterful work of cinematic art but rather a fun, metal on metal adventure - it's Transformers, not Sophie's Choice.  I'm not in the theater for a touching human drama, or up-scale humor [however the Twins are a little too overblown and annoying I must admit]. I'm there for a realistic version of Saturday morning adventure - and Revenge of the Fallen delievers.The 'supposed' plot holes are actually just threads where a lack of elaboration on the writer's part, of which they've even admitted on the commentary, failed to explain themselves to the general audience. When the Writers Strike hit, the plot of the movie was jumbled together from an initial outline, and then of course, the oh-so-famous curse of too many hands in the cookie jar.  Directorial compromises, Producer requests, etc. So I can see where people had a tiff or two, but for those of us who read the Marvel Comics run know about the abstract use of the Matrix of Leadership. (We also aren't tweens or ignorant critics who don't realize the Matrix of Leadership pre-dated Keanu Reeves by 13 years.) Those of us who read Dreamwave's War Within: The Dark Ages were familiar with The Fallen.  And most importantly - any fan who, like me, still watches the Gen 1 cartoon and digs multi-part episodes like 'Five Faces of Darkness' know that a good Transformer tale is nothing more than a race between good and evil to get their hands on the object in question.For a Transfan, the movie has a treasure trove of nods to the mythology - Soundwave & Ravage, the use of Combiner/Gestalt technology, Pretender technology, Power-Up technology, the crashed Nemesis, the Matrix of Leadership, and Megatron finally gets his arm canon - sort of.For anyone who hasn't seen the movie, ignore the criticism and instead use your own judgement.  If you like the Transformer brand and look for new stories, check out this flick.  If you just want to watch something you think you'll like, or expect to hate for that matter, don't bother. If you are curious, though, and want to bone up your mythology beforehand, read The Transformers issues #1-12 from 1980s, War Within: The Dark Ages, and watch the classic 1986 animated movie.

1164059,A3RZBOL3HHNED8,B0019M5C0Q,Ed. Mireles,"[17, 27]","Where should I begin?The story never seemed to quite fit in the transformers universe. First, Who is this fallen guy and why should we care about him? Megatron was supposed to be the worst SOB robot out there, (at least thats what we were told over and over in the first movie) turns out he is just a little sissy that works for this fallen robot which we have never heard of before, and doesn't look threatening at all. Another thing that makes no sense to me, Whats the point of fighting and trying to kill robots if its so easy to revive them? It was clearly stated at the end of Transformers that Megatron was death and dropped to sink at the world's deepest sea, making it impossible for him to come back thus the cold temperature wouldn't allow transformers to go get him because cold causes malfunctions to them, This rule was crucial in the plot of the first movie. Now it only takes about 4 generic robots to break this rule, dive in, fix Megatron, and he is back only to disappoint. Optimus gets very little screen time because of a fatal fight, but again it's so easy to bring him back to life!, even though he is the hero of this saga he made very little impact on this movie.Another thing that drove me crazy, Whats the point of having robots transforming into cars when there are robots that can be human like? completely unnecessary.So you have all of this great characters settled down from the First movie,Ironhide, Ratchet, Starscream ... they are all important Transformers and people are familiar with them, but instead you get Skids and Mudflaps, two annoying negro twins, wheels, a leg humping gremlin robot, and jetfire, an ancient robot that teleports(?). So bumble bee was supposed to be the comic relief of this movie, having all of this robots that have the archetype of a pixar character at the same time, just annoyed me to my nerves and skull.And this also makes me think: Who is this movie marketed for? Little kids? Teenagers who love Megan Fox and other unnecessary sexy scenes? Transformer fans? Action fans? Its hard to tell because at times the movie is edgy and violent and at times its cartoonish.Some human characters were also as annoying as the ""Pixar"" robots: Sam's parents and that Mexican dude. Really, why were they there the whole time? Every dialogue leads to a punch line, at the end its way overdone and unnecessary.The story delivers the most outdone cliches in holywood, its hard to list them all. Believe me.I have to give credit to the artists on charge of the special effects, congratulations. This is the only reason why I give a star to this movie and the only reason why this movie did so good on the box office. All of you have to admit that. But having great special effects just doesn't cut it.Not after watching other contemporary sci-fi movies such as: Batman, Hancock, Iron man, Star trek, Terminator and District 9 among others. Such movie franchises with such large followings are obligated to reach nothing else but prime quality film making. What I'm trying to say is that you need a good story to back up the great elements of fantasy and special effects.This isn't worth owning, but it could be a great rental if you don't mind the silly (stupid) details.On a final thought, I ought a quote from The Lou's review:  ""This review isn't for most younger viewers.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 5]","I will be up front: I gave this hateful film two stars because it had a few quality minutes...I say MINUTES.That is because I cannot tolerate anything getting a watered-down rating that it does not deserve. This smelly gym sock got a misleading PG, and I can't think of a better movie to tell parents to keep their little kids from seeing.Let me be more explicit: MPAA ratings have deliberately fuzzed and confused lines between them. A PG-13 rating, for example, may contain some garbage that would offend sensitive or very moral adults. Yet its simple explanation is parents ought to be warned that a PG-13 film might contain material inappropriate for kids under 13.In other words, what the hell does that mean?? They can show what they want. TRANSFORMERS is an excellent example: it has torture scenes, lots of foul language, terrible violence and some sexually 'suggestive' material that I wouldn't really like 16-year-olds watching. Yet there it is...and this film should have been rated R.It is this type of evil Hollyweird bait-and-switch in film that I have come to resent. I've seen excellent films undeservedly rated R...why? Why rated R without any noticeable reason? Swearing? It's the only explanation I can find, yet TRANSFORMERS has more swearing than adults can perceive at the first viewing. (I'm sure kids hear it instantly.)The storyline is of ZERO interest to me, and it will be of zero interest to anyone over 9 years of age--ironically, this film isn't viewable by those under the age of 17. There is a great deal of frankly dirty humor, four-letter words fly like robot parts, Shia is tortured horribly in a particularly disgusting scene......oh, and this thing had more TERMINATOR in it than TERMINATOR SALVATION had.There are sequels and what I call GELQUELS--and this is a gelquel because it made no sense, doesn't fit, has so much ugly garbage in it that I cannot believe this is what passes for a sequel. The original TRANSFORMERS was fun. It was a bit of fluff for kids, but it was intriguing to watch, the action was good (way too much military, just like this rotten offering), and you didn't have to hang your--or your children's--heads for seeing it.Heck, even my wife liked it and said Shia and the Transformers were cute.This film, no way.

There's a lot of razzle-dazzle, glitz, and bling, making it pretty to look at but it's still hollow to the core.  They even recycle some of the plot devices from the first film (from one-liners to the expected explosions, it's all the same).  This `new' story involves a sliver or two from the destroyed AllSpark.  (Rule one; never presume anything is truly finished or over.)  Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is all grown up and off to college.  In a scene reminiscent of those dreadful boy and his dog flicks, Sam dumps his faithful car, doing everything but throwing stones at it and ordering it to run free!  Naturally, Sam spends little to no time in college, as he is immediately embroiled in another tussle with the bad bots the Decepticons.  Magnified mayhem ensues on a grand scale.  John Turturro, the human villain from the last movie, is now a good guy (but he is replaced in this outing by another officious twit serving in the same type of role).  And!  They're still just as squeamish about death, showing only the vehicles and buildings and whatnot that the robots destroy, never the people who are inside them dead or dying.  Only two pseudo-death scenes are highlighted and both don't amount to anything.  It's all quite cautious and cowardly, revealing their target audience.  (Death as an abstraction doesn't serve anyone.)It's hard to invest anything in these films because they're just one long battle sequence after another; a flurry of kinetic energy that goes nowhere.

1164072,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B0019M5C0Q,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[5, 8]","Continuing where Transformers left off, the Autobots are valiantly defending Earth from the pesky Decepticons. Along the way, thousands of innocent civilians are killed, but who cares, the Decepticons always lose at the end of the day right? That is until new ones are created, or brought back to life by other pesky Decepticons from outer space. It is then where College Freshman Shia Laboef (I hate spelling his, or his character's last name) must then help save humanity, with the help of familiar friends and Meagan Fox, who filmmakers could find no better reason to be in this film other than cheesy emotional scenes and eye candy.I must admit, this film is impossible for a real movie reviewer, or critics to review because their job title has them breaking down movies to see if you should enjoy them. Unfortunately, if you break this film down, it loses all it's fun. So don't think, just sit and enjoy.See It If:You like Awesome action: This is almost a pure action movie, because the fighting sequences are stunning, and really make you get into the movie despite any flaws it may have. Sure, a 20-minute action sequence may be overblown, but I was enjoying every moment of it.You like comedy that is funny in the moment: To balance the intense action, the writers upped the quotient on comedy this time around, having several LOL jokes that kept a semi-permanent smile on my face throughout the film, especially in the college scenes. Kudos especially to Kevin Dunn, Julie White, and Rainn Wilson who play Shia's parents and teacher, respectively. I could have done without the juvenile scenes of dogs humping which a 6-year old sitting a few seats down from me found particularly enjoyable. However, don't think about these jokes later, because you mind lose your mind trying to wrap it around these jokes.Don't See It If:Your movies are driven on plot: This plot is one in the moment as you get it when it's happening, but you're left wondering later how the heck they got there. Again, don't think, just sit and enjoy.Your tolerance for pure stupidity is low: Yeah, this has been beaten to death by other reviewers. You have been warned.You hated the Transformers mythology: Because if you got confused before, you're going to be scratching your head here. It's like they went for the geeks, and left the rest of us just to ignore that aspect, because it gets confusing.Now For Some Observations:This movie is very grounded in 2009... Swine Flu jokes? Economy jokes? And a Chevy Volt? Will anybody get what any of this means in 10 years?Speaking of which, from the first scenes GM makes their presence known because they must have gotten a HUGE contract with the government.Obama is anti-Transformer! He's mentioned specifically by name in the movie as wanting to shut down the Transformers program as he feels they could be a threat to nation's security. I mean, he is pro immigration! His National Security advisor is also a jerk within the movie, so it shows poor judgement in his staff choices... Republicans, ravage at this fact, Democrats steer clear of these scenes.Did the composer get lazy in this movie? I counted no less than 4 times Linkin Park's ""New Divide"" was played in the movie either instrumentally or in full. Same goes for Green Day's ""21 Guns"" which I counted no less than 5 times during the movie. It also happened to be the ONLY song playing in Meagan Fox's garage.Again, a LOT of civilians die in this movie. In the first I was shocked when a Decepticon plowed through a bus, but in this movie, that's nothing. Buildings are wiped out, cars are smashed at will, aircraft carriers are blown up with no survivors. It's almost numbing after a while.Overall:In a survey of viewers that saw the movie, 91% said it was as good, if not better than the first. I would join these people in saying that what the first one sets up, the sequel takes and runs away with in explosive fashion. And despite its many flaws, I was fully-engrossed in the movie, and you will be too if you don't try to break it down, or take it too seriously. But I must admit I have seen this movie 4 or 5 times now, and it grates on me more every time I see it, so keep repeat viewing at an absolute minimum.

This movie is the best movie I have seen so far this summer (I've seen Wolverine, Star Trek, Angles and Demons, Phalam 123).  This was a very entertaining movie with good story line.  It did not have an overbearing love story and it did not have annoying comic relief (ie-jar jar in star wars I - trust me the twins were not annoying).  Plenty of actions and smooth transition from scene to scene.  Of course CGI was awesome.  I bet people who did not like this movie are the same ones who said ""Crying Game"" and ""Queen"" were awesome movies.  Just want to let you know I could not finish either movies mentioned before.  One thing to remember from my review is the entertainment value.  If you liked the first movie and if you like action movies, then Transformer 2 will not disappoint.  If I were you, I would watch this in theater  (IMAX preferred). Definitely an excellent movie and a definite BUY for me.

1164074,A2GEQ6I6M11JR2,B0019M5C0Q,Fred Rayworth,"[2, 5]","There is certainly a lot to like about this movie. It has lots of action, some great dialogue (in spots anyway) and a great cast of human characters.There was so much robot action, I found myself anxiously awaiting the next human to appear on screen. I know this is the trend of movies to be non-stop, no breathing room stories, but at times the action was so intense, the movement on screen so fast that I had to look away. The saving grace for me was the scenes with the human characters.Megan Fox is the hottest babe on the planet right now, and there is nothing in this movie to take away from that. To some (including herself), her part here was just eye candy, but I see in all of that hot chick stuff that the girl really has talent, if she can exploit it.Shia LaBeouf is a very likable character in this one, as he was in Indiana Jones. A quite capable actor with a lot going for him. He does an outstanding job.I loved the mom and dad. They made all the robot action come to a screeching halt with their typical American family banter. They had some of the funniest scenes in there.Glenn Morshower, the bodyguard from 24, is a favorite. He is perfect as the general (especially using his real name [General Morshower]) and I could hardly wait for him to give an order, or make a wisecrack.The rest of the actors handled their parts very well, especially John Turturro.I can't forget Josh Duhamel. He is a favorite of mine, yet in this movie, he is so buried in the scenes that he rarely gets to show his great talents as an actor. I came away wishing they'd given him more dialogue instead of having him constantly ducking for cover.The most annoying thing was those two ""ghetto boy"" robots. A pair of Jar Jar Binks'. I can see why people were upset with them as they seemed to stab at every stereotype imaginable. Yet, in a way they had their moments. If they were supposed to be comic relief, Mr. Bay could've come up with a much better idea.As far as the plot goes, just another good versus evil battle with plenty of holes, but who cares?Overall, this movie was mostly a fun ride, but in a way, it is the perfect excuse for a migraine unless you have a pause button. A bit too much action, and not enough breathing. Still, those moments of dialogue, especially the wisecracks, made it all worthwhile.

I wasn't a big fan of the first film, it was a decent 3 star (out of 5) popcorn movie with fun actions scenes and pretty special effects.  But it was also your typical Michael Bay summer blockbuster with mediocre acting, weak plot and stock dialogue.  So obviously I wasn't expecting too much with this, but I thought it might be a small step above the first, or at least on par with it.  But no, this film took a significant step down and should really ruin Michael Bay's already worthless reputation.To begin, the film was just a huge commercial for Chevy, Mountain Dew, and the soundtrack featuring all the latest and trendiest hits from Green Day, Linkin Park, and Nickelback.  Megan Fox's character was even more worthless than she was in the first film, and they really went out of their way to emphasize her hotness.  I also couldn't stand the 2 new Autobot ""twins,"" Mudflap and Skids.  Not only are these robots shamelessly plugging more Chevy cars (the Trax and Beat), but they also talk like black crackheads straight from the hood.  One of them even has a gold ""tooth,"" and they curse excessively.  I mean how ridiculous is that!?  The movie was full of silliness that was both immature and random.  In one scene, Sam's mom eats a hash brownie by mistake and runs a rampage through the college campus and tackles a student.  At one point Bumblebee cries like a little girl with a skinned knee.  There's also about 4 or 5 scenes with the dog-humping-the-leg joke...how mature.  It's like the movie was made by 5-year-olds, except that it's not appropriate for 5-year-olds.  Finally, the story has more holes than Swiss cheese.  At the end of the first film, Bumblebee's voice finally came back, but it's still broken throughout this entire movie.  And how did the Autobots drive from America to Egypt in a day?  And if the Fallen was in space all this time, what was he doing while Megatron was frozen for hundreds of years?  Many fans complained in the first film that Optimus Prime didn't show up until halfway in, and guess what, they take him out of half the film again!  This movie was just an absolute mess and I felt a little dumber after watching it.

1164088,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,B0019M5C0Q,Gregorio,"[1, 4]","Representing everything wrong with American ""Cinema"" it is shameful to note that this film was one of the biggest box office winners of the year.  Entirely awful in every respect, this is a nauseating, headache inducing nightmare that feels much longer than its 2 and a half hour running time. Although I hate to admit it, I DID enjoy some of the first TRANSFORMERS film (not much but enough to make me waste my time with this sequel). There is no story and nothing that could be called acting this time around.  All the characters simply shout at each other and scream their lines as quickly as they can (sometimes screaming so fast it is impossible to comprehend what they are saying). The CGI robots are intensely boring and overdone. There is LOTS of crude humor and every ""joke"" is some sort of sexual reference. And did I mention that the women in the cast are all portrayed as skanky whores?  Well they are.  When was the last time you saw a woman airbrushing a motorcycle in a porn star pose with her nearly bare ass in the air?  EVERY scene is edited so quickly that nothing appears on the screen for more than 10 seconds at a time and most shots last under 3 seconds.  It is impossible to ever get a look at what is really going on (if anything is).  Of course, if the box office is any indication, we can expect to see more of this nonsense from the most untalented sucessful ""film"" maker in history, Michael Bay, a being so devoid of true talent that the mind boggels.

1164089,A9YA983MXKCEL,B0019M5C0Q,"Gregory Bartz ""Gregorius""","[43, 67]","Revenge of the Fallen is a horrible movie. It's much worse than the first and is an absolute failure in almost every possible way. Here are a few:1) CRITICAL NARRATIVE CONTINUITY FAILUREThis movie does not have a ""plot"" per se. Instead, it has numerous chunks of plots that have sort of been smooshed together, and although each one makes internal sense, they add up to gibberish. For example, what happened to the Decepticons who revived Megatron (other than Ravage)? How did Sam's parents get from France to Egypt, and why? Why does Sam suddenly stop seeing those symbols? Where'd that blue guy (Bolt or Jolt or whatever its name is) come from, and what happened to it? It was on screen for about 2 seconds out of the whole movie. What's worse is that many of these plot chunks are not even consistent with the original movie, much less each other. Seriously. In the first movie, the leader of the Decepticons was Megatron, who started the war because of a dispute over how to use the Cube's abilities. In the second movie, the leader of the Decepticons is The Fallen, who started the war because of a dispute over star-destruction regulations. I still don't remember whether or not explanations were given for why a key was created for The Fallen's doomsday device, why The Fallen returned to Cybertron, blah blah blah...2) CRITICAL CHARACTERIZATION FAILUREMy mind is still trying to come to grips with the fact that the three most annoying, useless characters in the movie - let's call them Hump-Bot, Beavis, and Butt-head - got such huge amounts of dialog and screen time, whereas characters that might have actually been cool, like Ratchet, Ironhide, Arcee, and the silver car with the swords for arms, got virtually none and were completely wasted. Other beloved characters from the old cartoon that had great potential, like Hound and Mirage, were left out of the movie entirely (AGAIN!) to make room for the useless idiot characters. On the Decepticon side of things, I guess it's kind of cool that Soundwave showed up, even if he didn't actually do anything except talk in space (which makes no sense for numerous scientific and narrative reasons that I won't go into). Devastator shows up, but at no point in the movie is the word ""Constructicon"" mentioned, nor are the names of the Constructicons mentioned, nor do the Constructicons even have individual robot forms or identities as far as I can tell. To make up for it, there are numerous other Decepticons that also transform into construction equipment, but aren't Constructicons, and do have individual robot modes, but not names. The biggest insult, however, was Skyfire. The very best episode in the original cartoon was all about Skyfire and his difficult choice between his friendship with Starscream and his sense of moral right and wrong. He had the greatest potential to be an awesome, complex, well-developed character with an interesting storyline. In this movie, however, he has been reduced to an old geezer yelling ""get off my lawn, dagnabbit kids and their rock and roll music... back in my day... fifteen miles through the snow... prune juice... broke my hip back in World War 2, ya know..."" until he finally kills himself because he can't stand how much he sucks compared to his cartoon version. Then, instead of having an ""alas poor yorick, I knew him well"" moment, Optimus is like ""hey thanks yo, I could use the parts"" and goes SUPER SAIYAN FOR TEH WIN.3) CRITICAL MATURITY FAILUREOkay, I'll admit that a guy accidentally tasing himself in the nuts is kinda funny, and if you're 9 years old, watching Mojo hump another dog might be funny too. But a robot humps Mikaela's leg? Devastator has testicles? Dear God... it's like ""Bumblebee pisses on John Turturro"" times ten. And I did NOT need to see John Turturro's hairy arse in a G-string! Seriously, I'm not making this up.4) CRITICAL ABILITY-TO-SEE-WHAT-THE-HECK-IS-GOING-ON FAILUREThe first movie suffered heavily from this as well.5) CRITICAL NARRATIVE CONTINUITY FAILUREOkay, so, like... couldn't the Fallen have just built a second sun-killing device? One that didn't require a key? How can the Cube hold all Cybertronian knowledge if it predates their civilization? How did the Cube go from ""put it in a robot's chest and it kills them"" to ""put it in a robot's chest and it revives them""? WHY HOW WHY HOW?!?With that having been said, I confess that I did enjoy myself quite a lot during this movie. Sam's parents were excellent, as were the scenes with Megatron and Starscream. I also loved the fact that they brought back Frank welker for the voice of Soundwave, even if he's doing his Dr. Claw voice from Inspector Gadget instead of his Soundwave voice. Overall, though, the vague semblance of a plot sucks, most of the characters suck, much of the humor sucks, basically everything in this movie sucks.",1,Absolutely horrible,1246147200,"06 28,

Decepticons.Now he's preparing for the biggest challenge of his life: leaving home for college.Despite his extreme heroics,the battle of Mission City has become an urban legend believed only by conspiracy theorists.Sam is still an average teenager with everyday anxieties and excitement about heading off into adulthood,separating from his parents for the first time,and vowing to be faithful to girlfriend Mikaela.Of course,he also has to explain his departure to his guardian robot,Bumblebee.Leaving home is something the Autobots understand only too well.With the destruction of the Allspark,the Transformers home planet of Cybertron is uninhabitable,and the Autobots(Optimus Prime,Bumblebee,Ironhide,Ratchet,The Sisters(Arcee,Chromia,& Moonracer),The Twins(Mudflap & Skids),Sideswipe & Jolt)make the best of their lives on earth,working in league with the military as part of a TOP SECRET team called NEST.Operating alongside their human counterparts,field commanders Major Lennox and USAF Master Sergeant Epps,the NEST TEAM seeks to hunt down whatever remaining Decepticons are still hiding on earth.Unfortunately,even as the Autobots try to make a new life among humans,they discover they may not be welcome.National Security Advisor Theodore Galloway,driven to prove that all Transformers should be banished from earth,endeavors to terminate NEST,believing the Autobots very presence may endanger the human race.Optimus Prime,the leader of the Autobots,agrees to leave our planet if the governments of the world wish it... but he warns Galloway to consider what happens if the Autobots leave earth defenseless.Meanwhile at school,Sam adjusts to his pushy,legend-in-his-own mind roommate,Leo,and an equally aggressive temptation in the form of a new co-ed,Alice.Sam does his best to navigate college life,until suddenly he's besieged by visions flashing across his brain like thunderbolts.The Decepticons soon learn what Sam doesn't know;that he alone holds the key to the outcome of the struggle between evil and the ultimate power of good.A normal life will have to wait.With the help of the Autobots,the soldiers of NEST,and an old adversary-turned-ally,former Sector 7 Agent Simmons,Sam and Mikaela must uncover the secret history of the Transformers presence on earth,and the sacrifices that have to be made to save it from an

The screenplay/dialogue is just plain ridiculus, and it doesn't have to be that way.  Look at Star Wars (yes all 6).  Granted Lucas did a fine job writing and directing the 1st one (1977), then he was smart enought to pass both the writing and directing over to other people (Lawrence Kasdan, Irving Kershner, Richard Marquand?) for both Empire and Jedi.  Which is why I believe Empire to be the difinitive best of the series.  Then Lucas makes us wait 15 plus years and decides to take full writing and directing credit for the prequels and aside from a few cool scenes, the films were awful.

This time our hero Sam Witwicky (played again by Shia LaBeouf) and his plucky girlfriend Mikaela Banes (played again by Megan Fox) are being pursued by the evil Decepticon Transformers because Sam has information in his brain about the location of a lost Transformer artifact known as the Matrix of Leadership (buried somewhere on the earth) which holds the key to unlocking the Sun Harvester, a weapon of unspeakable power used in the distant past by Prime Transformer robots to cause stars to explode so that the energy from these explosions could be converted to power Cybertron (the Transformers' planet of origin)'s AllSpark (the life force of the Transformers). The Sun Harvester is located somewhere on the earth and if activated will cause our sun to explode, destroying the earth in the process and wiping out mankind. Behind this dastardly plan is a rogue Prime Transformer and former brother of the leader of the benevolent Autobot Transformers Optimus Prime, who rebelled against the code of the Prime Transformers (which states that the Sun Harvester should only be used on uninhabited suns to prevent loss of life) and who as a result is now and forever known as The Fallen. But with Optimus Prime recently slain in battle, there is no Autobot powerful enough to defeat the Fallen (as only a Prime can stand up to him), so the earth is doomed, unless Sam can somehow use the Matrix of Leadership to resurrect the dead Optimus Prime. But with the Decepticons determined to stop Sam at all costs, Sam's efforts just may cost him his life.Comments: this was a most fun movie that just got better as it went on. The action scenes are as spectacular as in the first Transformers movie and the plot is as big as it gets: saving the earth from destruction. Leading man Shia LaBeouf's character Sam Witwicky matures much in this movie and Megan Fox's character Mikaela Banes is as resourceful as she is beautiful. And lest we forget the robot characters are called `Transformers' for a reason: the various scenes where robot characters transform from earthly vehicles into their true forms will take your breath away and are a marvel of modern CGI. This is how you do a big summer robot blockbuster movie, although I do have a few criticisms: some of the humour in this film doesn't really work and often when the Transformers are fighting because the camera is held so close to the action you often can't see exactly what is going on. This film may be based on Hasbro toy characters but the plot is pleasingly complex and there is a depth to this film that exceeds that of the first film, as well as the tale of man overcoming his mistrust of beings from other worlds to stand with alien allies against mutual enemies. That and a clear multi-million dollar budget (some of the robot special effects in this film are unbelieveable) makes this a must see film, arguably even better than the other two big sci-fi films of summer 2009, Terminator: Salvation and Star Trek.

1164105,A1FX8F4YIIXEWZ,B0019M5C0Q,Jacob Warren,"[2, 4]","Since the release of 2007's  ""Transformers"" critics--mostly fans of the 1980's animated series--have labeled Bay's re-imagining of these shape-changing alien robots a complete failure, going so far as to claim that Bay ""hates the Transformers"" and ""wants to ruin our childhood memories.""These detractors obviously have not seen the original Transformers  series since its 1984 debut, their perception of the modern films dimmed by their nostalgia. Look at the premise of the cartoon: On the distant planet of Cybertron a race of sentient robots are waging civil war. The two factions are the peace-seeking Autobots and the war-mongering Decepticons. Their seemingly endless battle somehow comes to the relatively young planet of Earth, where the Decepticons seek out significant power sources for universal conquest and the Autobots change into vehicles so they may disguise themselves among Earth's inhabitants while working to defeat the Decepticons. All of this adds up to big action, mindless robot fights, and stuff blowing up.What's the plot of the movies? The same thing: The same robots from the same far-off plant come to Earth to fight the same war with the same strategies. The explosions are better, however.There are three distinct differences between classic Transformers and the modern (dubbed by some the ""Bayformers""). 1) The Autobots no longer look like boxes with arms and legs (which is a good thing.), 2) one of the main characters is a stiff doll-like female capable of little real emotion (Megan Fox, the films' only significant downside. Actually, now that I think of it, there was a useless female human introduced in Transformers Season 2), and 3) Megatron does not immediately jump to the goal of Ruling the Known Universe. The first and third difference are unimportant ones that nevertheless make the movies slightly more realistic and slightly less dumb.Michael Bay, believe it or not, does not what to ruin your childhood memories. Those cartoons and toys are still there for you to enjoy. If you cannot see the likeness shared by those cartoons on the modern films, I'm afraid your nostalgia is getting in the way of the facts (honestly, just go back and watch those terrible cartoons; you'll see exactly what I'm talking about). ""Transformers"" and ""Revenge of the Fallen"" serve up healthy portions of robot action, alien mythos, and underlying commentary on the human race.Just like the originals.Whether you like the Bay films or hate them, we should all keep two things in mind:1) The Transformers has always been about big, dumb fun with robot action and transforming. To expect anything different from modern films is foolish, and practically your admission to wanting something different from the originals.2) The 2007 and 2009 films are the re-imagining of a 1980's cartoon that served as little more than a series of lengthy commercials for, you guessed it, toys.

I have to also laugh at those people, as the original was a good cartoon, but it was foremost a commercial to sell toys. If you have ever watched any of the interviews with the people who started the show, they will tell you that the reason the show was made, was to get kids to buy their toys. Sure they tried to have some good stories in the show, but there were a lot of story flaws. The background of certain transformers changed multiple time in order to sell a different toy. So, what is so wrong with these new movies. All they are doing are selling an action pack toy commercial. Who else better to get than a man who loves action like Micheal Bay. He wasn't brought in to make a movie about story, they wanted an action packed movie to sell toys to a new generation of kids. You can't expect Oscar movies from this type of idea. Most action movies are not Oscar type movies. I liked these movies because I knew what to expect, and they delivered what they promised, a big robot action movie.

1164112,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0019M5C0Q,Jason,"[4, 9]","First and foremost, let's get the positives out of the way.  The action and special effects in this movie are incredible.  It's nothing less than one would expect.  During all the battle scenes, and especially during the scenes around the pyramids, there are some incredible, sphincter-tightening, tense moments.  For sci-fi fans and special effects fans, this may well be in the pantheon.  Transformers II is a ""shut your brain off"" good time, with explosions, transforming cars, crisp action scenes, and a decent enough plot that has the feel of a National Treasure sequel.  But with alien cars that can shape-shift.  And speaking of that, this movie makes a significant improvement over the original by giving more attention to the Transfromers and less to the humans.  Now that that's out of the way...Let me get this right.  Shia Lebouf's character goes away to college, leaving the impossibly hot Megan Fox and his shape-shifting car back home?  Let's back up one second, because that's just too colossally ridiculous.He leaves Megan Fox - who is clearly about 500 miles, 250 football fields, and 98 fathoms out of his range - his current girlfriend that will epically dwarf all other possible girls and/or women with which he'll ever be with, or probably even see in college (read: ever), to go to a far off college that requires a webcam for communication?  You're telling me there wasn't a diesel engine tech school nearby?  Any time an integral story arc derives from American Pie II, and the movie is not meant as a ridiculous yet enjoyable comedy, it's usually a bad thing (even Jim realized he screwed up by leaving Nadia and would never have a chance with a woman like that again).  All of this, of course, is secondary on the WTF-scale to the fact that he actually leaves Bumblebee behind.Bumblebee, his sentient, alien, shape-shifting car who not only helped Shia land Megan Fox, but also helped save his life, and can pull up any song in the history of songs on merely a whim - which is like having a 1-million disc CD-changer - being abandoned is just too hard for me to believe, even if it is a Michael Bay blockbuster without common sense.It's a fun movie with a few unnecessary parts, and some really stupid humor shoved in, but overall I'd recommend it (mainly for Megan Fox and the action).",4,"Exactly what I expected, better than the original, and I'm still a bit unimpressed",1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,2313,"['First', 'foremost', 'let', 'get', 'positives', 'way', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'incredible', 'nothing', 'less', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'battle', 'scenes', 'especially', 'scenes', 'pyramids', 'are', 'incredible', 'sphincter-tightening', 'tense', 'moments', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'special', 'effects', 'fans', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'pantheon', 'Transformers', 'II', 'shut', 'brain', 'good', 'time', 'explosions', 'transforming', 'cars', 'crisp', 'action', 'scenes', 'decent', 'enough', 'plot', 'feel', 'National', 'Treasure', 'sequel', 'alien', 'cars', 'can', 'shape-shift', 'speaking', 'movie', 'significant', 'improvement', 'original', 'giving', 'more', 'attention', 'Transfromers', 'less', 'humans', 'Now', 'way', 'Let', 'get', 'right', 'Shia', 'Lebouf', 'character', 'away', 'college', 'leaving', 'impossibly', 'hot', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'shape-shifting', 'car', 'back', 'home', 'Let', 'back', 'up', 'one', 'second', 'just', 'too', 'colossally', 'ridiculous.He', 'leaves', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'who', 'clearly', 'about', '500', 'miles', '250', 'football', 'fields', '98', 'fathoms', 'range', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'will', 'epically', 'dwarf', 'other', 'possible', 'girls', 'and/or', 'women', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'be', 'probably', 'even', 'see', 'college', 'read', 'ever', 'go', 'far', 'off', 'college', 'webcam', 'communication', ""'re"", 'telling', 'was', ""n't"", 'diesel', 'engine', 'tech', 'school', 'nearby', 'Any', 'time', 'integral', 'story', 'arc', 'derives', 'American', 'Pie', 'II', 'movie', 'not', 'meant', 'ridiculous', 'yet', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'usually', 'bad', 'thing', 'even', 'Jim', 'realized', 'screwed', 'up', 'leaving', 'Nadia', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'chance', 'woman', 'again', 'course', 'secondary', 'WTF-scale', 'fact', 'actually', 'Bumblebee', 'behind.Bumblebee', 'sentient', 'alien', 'shape-shifting', 'car', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'helped', 'Shia', 'land', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'also', 'helped', 'save', 'life', 'can', 'pull', 'up', 'song', 'history', 'songs', 'merely', 'whim', 'having', '1-million', 'disc', 'CD-changer', 'being', 'abandoned', 'just', 'too', 'hard', 'believe', 'even', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'blockbuster', 'common', 'sense.It', 'fun', 'movie', 'few', 'unnecessary', 'parts', 'really', 'stupid', 'humor', 'shoved', 'overall', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'mainly', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'action']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

How come nobody can see that a big robot is destroying one of the pyramid? Is the army that stupid or what? Should i go on? To try and analyze this is to give the story to much credit. Which it doesn't deserve.To witness a brilliant actor like John Turturro make a fool of himself this way is very sad. Shameful, pitiful and embarrassing. Almost vulgar in its presumption. It's not even selling one's self to the Devil. It's just loosing prestige. The way he did it in ""The Big Lebowski"" was something amazing. Worthy of his talent. Here, there is no word. Well yes, there is. Sad.For the first time in my life, i almost walked out of the theatre right in the middle of the movie. I didn't because i didn't want to disturb other people. Michael Bay clearly is a intelligent person. For him to do this just shows that he was condescending to his public. ""We'll just do this and that and they'll buy it"". That sort of thing.Oh yeah! Megan Fox is truly a beautiful woman and sure, the special effects are dazzling! But who is surprised by that? Every new movie comes with special effects that are always better and better. We expect it. There's got to be more than this. Like an actual story. Or simply a true desire for making a good film. Like the first one.You know what the worst thing is? Some people are actually defending this thing i dare call a film. Some are even saying that we, who didn't like it, exagerate. That it is only a movie. A pop-corn movie. That it's not a intellectual film. And so on.That is frightening. And if you don't understand why it is frightening, than THAT is even more frightening.People, we can't simply justify something crappy by saying ""it's only a movie""! What's wrong with you all? You are watching it for two hours. Do you like to be taken for a fool? There are so many good movies out there, why settle for this and say ""It's only a pop-corn movie""?Are you that easy to entertain?If you're gonna respond to that, it'll just depress me more. In this case, you simply don't have the right to defend this movie. You Can't. Sorry. I've decided it for everyone. Think what you will. In this case, i refuse to have an open mind. This is a bad movie. You know it. I know it. It happens. We're all able to say that Wayne Gretzky was a great hockey player or that Robert De Niro is one of the best actor. Well, we're all able to say that ""Transformers 2"" is a baaaaad movie. And that those who defends it are... well, they are wrong. No, they're evil.",1,"C'mon, you all!

Maybe he should remove some of that metal and replace it with some education.  I'd hate read his job resume.  As for his actual opinion of the movie, that's his opinion.  As we all know, opinions are like butts, everyone has one, and sooner or later they all stink.  By the way, fella, it's about the people AND the bots, okay?  The theme is about how we humans and the bots need to trust each other and work together for a common cause.  As for me, I saw the movie.  Did he?  Really?  I enjoyed it very much.  So did my wife, and she's not nearly the sci-fi fan I am.  She fell in love the the Corvette-bot.  Bumble Bee is my personal favorite.  His expressions - yes, he has them - reminds my wife and me of one of our cats who uses the same kind of guilt-trip looks and sounds when he wants something.  The action factor was waaaaay up over the first Transformers since the characters were established and Michael Bay did not see the need to reindroduce them.  For that, KUDOS!  Way to do it!  I like wall-to-wall action.  This movie is a 2-1/2-hour roller coaster ride.  I really didn't see the need for the mother to get whacked out on those special brownies, but I have to admit it was funny.  I only have one criticism about the show.  STOP THE STUPID, CONDESCENDING SLOW-MOTION CRAP!!!  It does nothing for the movie.  It does NOT intensify an exciting and critical moment but only wrecks it.  Someone, please get this message out to Mr. Bay and all those other action movie producers and directors.  I'm on my knees right now, okay?  That's why I appreciate George Lucas.  Re-examine the light saber fights in the second Star Wars trilogy, the three prequels.  Lightning fast but able to keep up with it.  Slo-mo basically explains the sequence.  I think we're all smart enough not to need it, don't you?  I would have given (not ""would of gave"", Metalhead!) the movie five stars if it weren't for the slow motion sequences.  Still, it's a very worthy effort, expecially with a duffle bag full of fresh popcorn and a 55-gallon drum of soda.

If there is they need a more talented director like JJ Abrams. Michael Bay did a better job with the first film. This one has less of a head on it's shoulder. I think with sequels Bay will just give us the same stuff over and over again. Megan Fox in tight clothes running and screaming in slow motion ""not that there's anything wrong with that lol"", Decepticons after Sam and Autobots having to protect him and the humans being more developed and shown more than the Transformers.The fights between the Autobots and Decepticons are just messy and the movement is so quick that it's hard to keep up with what's going on. While the Transformers are just side characters in their own franchise, everything is more about Sam and his girlfriend (Megan Fox). We are hardly introduced to any of the new Autobots. The 2 new Autobots to me were as painful as 2 Jar-Jar Binks. They were annoying. While the film could have used characters like Hot Rod or the Dinobots. But even if they were in it, I don't think we'd even be introduced to them or be made to care about them. The only Autobot that we were ever made to really care about in the films is Bumble Bee, we don't really care if any of the others get ripped apart since they are undeveloped. Hell even Optimos Prime is under-used in this movie.Bay knows how to do very few things. Such as...blowing stuff up, making a loud movie and smothering us with patriotism and romance. The first movie had all that, but it was executed better and the movie was fresh. This one could have just used a lot more development. I mean people complained that Terminator: Salvation was all action and no brains but I think that applies to this film a lot more. It has nice effects, the acting wasn't bad and there was some fun but it wasn't as good as I was hoping for. It has more battles and more action, yet it gets tiresome.

But if your looking for a fun entertaining time with, hot women, great action and special effects Transformers 2 is the movie for you.Unlike the reviewers out there I knew what I was getting from this movie. I wasn't expecting wonderful acting or a great story. I was expecting a entertaining fun time and of course Megan Fox.The Things I liked: 1. The chemistry between all the old actors from the first movie was great. You could tell they were having a good time filming the movie. You could tell by how good a acting job everyone did. I was surprised.2. The action/special effects: The were both great. I'm glad they got the help of the military again for this movie it added to both the feel and action of the film. All the actors/stunt men did a great job.Then there was ILM and their special effects of the action and Transformers was superb.3. Megan Fox: Damn she is hot. What ever flaws this film had she did a great job of distracting me during the movie. I think I might have given this film 4 stars of less if it weren't for her.The things I didn't like.1. The Story: This was the worst part of the film. It just made almost no sense. Especially the part about there being a source of energon on Earth, but there was none, so what was the point of building the weapon on Earth when I'm sure they could have done it on any of the other planets.2. The Transformers: The special effects were great, but there were just way to many characters. The only ones that had any impact for me was Optimas Prime, Bumble Bee, Soundwave(one of my favorite characters for the old show.), Star Scream, Megatron, and Jet Fire(Who I thought was a great character.), the rest were cannon fodder.Overall: A really good movie worth seeing, but again this is a Michal Bay movie. They same guy who directed Bad Boys 1 and 2, Pearl Harbor, and Armageddon so don't expect a amazing story and great acting worthy of Oscars.

1164127,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B0019M5C0Q,Joe Carugati,"[9, 18]","Heart.  It's something the first ""Transformers"" had in 2007.  Flash forward two years (and millions of dollars) later and the inevitable sequel is upon as, aptly subtitled, ""Revenge of the Fallen.""  Bigger, louder, funnier, more action-packed, and longer are the best way to describe the sequel.  While this may seem like a wet dream to Transformers' fans, it's also dumber, lacks true wit and charm, and at many points, just feels lazy.  It's all quantity over quality.Two years have passed since the battle between the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons in Mission City, LA.  Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving), leader of the Decepticons, was killed when our young hero, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) shoved the Allspark into his chest and for the time being, everything seemed fine.  Now, signs of Decepticons are showing up all over the world and the government decides to join sides with the Autobots and form NEST, a tactical group aimed to find and hunt down rogue Decepticons.  Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) returns as the Autobot leader, skydiving into Shanghai, China, where he exterminates a Decepticon, not before hearing from the enemy's mouth that the Fallen is coming.  The Fallen is one of the earliest Decepticons and his presence on Earth could mean the end for humanity.  Along with Lennox (Josh Duhamel), Epps (Tyrese Gibson), and the rest of NEST, Optimus realizes that he may need Sam to help him once more.Sam has is own problems though.  He's going off to college and that means saddened parents (Julie White and Kevin Dunn), a saddened girlfriend, Mikaela (Megan Fox), and a saddened car, Bumblebee.  To add to the mix, he touched a piece of Allspark that was found in his attire he wore the day of Mission City.  All of a sudden he starts seeing symbols that begin to interrupt with his college life.  Eventually, news gets out to the Decepticons that Sam has priceless information in his head that could be the key to bringing Fallen to Earth to continue his reign.  Before you know it, the Decepticons are on Sam's tail as well as Mikaela's, Sam's college roommate, Leo's (Ramon Rodriguez), and the ex-Sector 7 agent, Simmons' (John Turturro).  From Pennsylvania to Washington to Egypt, they race against the clock with Optimus and the Autobots trying to fend the Decepticons off and hoping to stop the Fallen from making an appearance.""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a mess of a movie.  And here's why...First, since there are too many storylines, the characters (who we've come to appreciate due to the first film) don't grow whatsoever and I even forgot some were in the movie half the time (the NEST team).  It was like Bay said, ""Oh, wait, I forgot we have these characters over here...Let's cut back to them to show the audience they are still in the movie.""  Another problem with the characters was that we didn't need most of them.  Ramon Rodriguez, John Turturro, Kevin Dunn and Julie White would have been fine if they were involved in small roles, but they are in the entire film!  They are used only for humor for 99% of the running time, but when the script asks them to be dramatic for that 1%, it just seems out of place.  All the actors are credible though.  It's just that they deserve better.Second, I didn't care about the Autobots save for Bumblebee.  Optimus Prime and the rest of the Autobots became cold-blooded killers in this installment.  In the first film, it seemed that wanted to use violence as a last resort when it came to Decepticons, but they're the ones doing the hunting and killing.  They also lack screen time compared to the first outing with Optimus and Bumblebee maybe getting thirty minutes each.  Instead, the audience is treated to the Twins, Mudflap and Skidz, two robots that do get a great scene towards the end of the film, but again, add nothing to the story, but humor that doesn't work.Third, the whole film felt rushed in both its writing and direction.  Characters and robots aren't developed and I didn't even know or fear any of the Decepticons, especially the Fallen, which is a problem if Bay was trying to make him terrifying.  I didn't care about his feud with Optimus at all or what the point was.  Since the writing isn't great, it just seems like everyone is going through the motions to get from point A to point B and the audience is stuck doing the same.  In terms of direction and editing, it was sloppy at times.  Characters appear and then disappear for the remaining movie for no reason.  Shots were re-used from the first film and even from the same film (they show the same shot of Soundwave and change the audio).  Lazy...  Also, the pacing was off for the film.  The first hour goes by fairly quickly, but then the next hour slows down to a screeching halt.  Finally, the plot of the movie is revealed and at that point, we don't care.Finally, the special effects and the action scenes were less stellar this time around in my opinion.  It was like the technicians at ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) focused on getting some robots to look incredible while others were passable.  The worst offense is that Optimus Prime did not look good at all in this movie.  In the first, he looked flawless, but now, he looks like a videogame creation.  His character is too shiny, too bright, and walks around like he's made of air and not tons of metal.  Now, while there were more action scenes in this film than the first, I couldn't care at all about what happened (or understand what was happening), especially in the final fight scene.  It goes on for way too long, explosions seem to happen for no reason, you can't tell one Transformer from another, and the Fallen is criminally under-used.  He's supposed to be the ultimate villain of all the Transformers, but he's really just a weakling.  Also, Bay shows us Devastator (who does look awesome), but he does nothing.  He sucks in some sand, terrorizes the comic reliefs of the film, climbs a pyramid, and takes off the top of it.  That's it.  He was so built up in the trailer and he did little to nothing in the film.  What a waste.Was there anything good to say about the movie?  Actually, yes.  First, the acting was passable with Megan Fox actually being the best (she's gorgeous, but also knows how dumb the movie is) and Shia LaBeouf being the worst.  His dialogue consisted of ""No! No! No!"", ""Optimus!, and ""Bumblebee!"" on repeat.  I could have played Sam Witwicky, dude.  While I didn't care for the action on a whole, the forest fight pitting Optimus against Megatron, Grindor, and Starscream was neat (although so similar to King Kong fighting three Rexes) and Bumblebee taking on two Decepticons was cool.  The special effects were tight for the most part besides what I talked about and finally, Steve Jablonsky's score.  These movies could be god-awful, but his music would always be epic and wonderfully done.So...did I have a good time at the movies?  Yes and no.  I thought the film was fun at some parts, the action was well shot, and had some good comedy, but it wasn't what I came to see.  I wanted to see an epic fight between Autobots and Decepticons, learn more about them, and see an all out war.  Instead, I got Shia LaBeouf with alien robots on the side.  The plot was less than great, I didn't care for any robots (Bumblebee still rocks though), the humor was not needed at all, sloppy direction and writing at times, and some rushed special effects hindered what could have been the movie of '09.  I really wanted to like this film, but it came across as just so-so.  It has everything you'd want in a summer blockbuster, but it lacks something crucial, which the first ""Transformers"" had.

1164130,AIBSC3DOO3UHR,B0019M5C0Q,"John B. Connor ""dragonsandsuch""","[21, 34]","First of all, this is a movie based on a toy franchise marketed for kids 5 and up, so don't even start with the ""it's not intended for kids"" crap. You know kids are going to want to see this and the filemakers should have taken that into account. The level of crude humor and sexual content in this movie was completely irresponsible.Now, knowing that kids are going to want to see it, does that mean it needs to be dumbed down? No, it does not. Look at the ORIGINAL Star Wars movies (espially SW and ESB). They appealed to both children AND adults without being dumbed down for the kids or made too mature so as to be inappropriate.Who were they trying to appeal to in this, though? Certainly not kids, because the amount of swearing, crude humor, and sexual references (including a fairly gratuitus up-skirt shot of a coed in a slinky dress) make it inapproriate for children, yet the sophmoric idiocy of the crude humor makes it embarressing for the actual grown up. It was like watching ""Revenge of the Nerds"" with giant robots thrown in.Some examples of the crude humor:* Wheelie humping Mikaela's leg* two dog humping scenes* Devastator having testicles* Former Agent Simmons in a thongSome examples of the sexual content* Sam's dorm room covered in posters of half-naked girls* Sam being seduced multiple times by the pretender ""Alice""* Upskirt shot of ""Alice"" and she's atop Sam in bed* Mikaela constantly posing as if it were a Maxim photo shoot.Plus there is an excessive amount of swearing throughout the film.This sort of thing might be what makes a ""good"" National Lampoon movie, but it is not only unneeded, but actually brings down, a film that is supposed to be a sci-fi action movie about giant robots.Plot-wise, there were a number of problems as well.* Anyone who knows anything about the Transformers knows that Megatron serves only Megatron. If he is forced to serve someone else, it is reluctantly and only until he can destroy that individual. They got that right in the first. In this one, he is kissing the rear axil of the Fallen.* Didn't Bay learn from the Phantom Menace? Jar Jar Binks characters are nearly universally despised, yet we get two, in the forms of Mudflap and Skids. They are so overwhelmingly annoying that I spent the entire time they were on screen waiting for them to get killed. (I could care less if they were racial steriotypes. So was Jazz from the first. Jazz, however, was cool. These two were obnoxious. And they killed off Jazz but neither of these -go figure.)* The cool Autobots got very little screen time.* There was a massive lack on continuity between the first and second movie as well.These plot problems I could live with, but the crassness I cannot, which is truly disappointing to me because the movie DID get somethings right. The action sequences were great. I loved the team effort between the soldiers and the Autobots in taking down the Decepticons. I loved that there were more Transformers overall as well. I also liked the dead on depiction of our current administration. After the World ""Apology"" tour, I can easily see Obama blaming the Autobots for the destruction the Decepticons caused and asking them to leave (while turning Sam over to Megatron and the Fallen).",2,Warning: Do not bring you kids to this!!,1246492800,"07 2, 2009",2009,3241,"['First', 'all', 'movie', 'based', 'toy', 'franchise', 'marketed', 'kids', '5', 'up', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'start', 'not', 'intended', 'kids', 'crap', 'know', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'see', 'filemakers', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'account', 'level', 'crude', 'humor', 'sexual', 'content', 'movie', 'was', 'completely', 'irresponsible.Now', 'knowing', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'see', 'mean', 'be', 'dumbed', 'down', 'No', 'not', 'Look', 'ORIGINAL', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'espially', 'SW', 'ESB', 'appealed', 'children', 'adults', 'being', 'dumbed', 'kids', 'made', 'too', 'mature', 'so', 'be', 'inappropriate.Who', 'were', 'trying', 'appeal', 'Certainly', 'not', 'kids', 'amount', 'swearing', 'crude', 'humor', 'sexual', 'references', 'including', 'fairly', 'gratuitus', 'up-skirt', 'shot', 'coed', 'slinky', 'dress', 'make', 'inapproriate', 'children', 'yet', 'sophmoric', 'idiocy', 'crude', 'humor', 'embarressing', 'actual', 'grown', 'up', 'was', 'watching', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'giant', 'robots', 'thrown', 'in.Some', 'examples', 'crude', 'humor', '*', 'Wheelie', 'humping', 'Mikaela', 'leg*', 'two', 'dog', 'humping', 'scenes*', 'Devastator', 'having', 'testicles*', 'Former', 'Agent', 'Simmons', 'thongSome', 'examples', 'sexual', 'content*', 'Sam', 'dorm', 'room', 'covered', 'posters', 'half-naked', 'girls*', 'Sam', 'being', 'seduced', 'multiple', 'times', 'pretender', 'Alice', '*', 'Upskirt', 'shot', 'Alice', 'atop', 'Sam', 'bed*', 'Mikaela', 'constantly', 'posing', 'were', 'Maxim', 'photo', 'shoot.Plus', 'excessive', 'amount', 'swearing', 'film.This', 'sort', 'thing', 'might', 'be', 'what', 'good', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'unneeded', 'actually', 'down', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'movie', 'giant', 'robots.Plot-wise', 'were', 'number', 'problems', 'well', '*', 'Anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'Transformers', 'Megatron', 'only', 'Megatron', 'forced', 'serve', 'someone', 'else', 'reluctantly', 'only', 'can', 'destroy', 'individual', 'got', 'right', 'first', 'one', 'kissing', 'rear', 'axil', 'Fallen', '*', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Bay', 'learn', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'characters', 'are', 'nearly', 'universally', 'despised', 'yet', 'get', 'two', 'forms', 'Mudflap', 'Skids', 'are', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'annoying', 'spent', 'entire', 'time', 'were', 'screen', 'waiting', 'get', 'killed', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'were', 'racial', 'steriotypes', 'So', 'was', 'Jazz', 'first', 'Jazz', 'however', 'was', 'cool', 'two', 'were', 'obnoxious', 'killed', 'off', 'Jazz', '-go', 'figure', '*', 'cool', 'Autobots', 'got', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', '*', 'was', 'massive', 'lack', 'continuity', 'first', 'second', 'movie', 'well.These', 'plot', 'problems', 'could', 'live', 'crassness', 'can', 'not', 'truly', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'DID', 'get', 'somethings', 'right', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'great', 'loved', 'team', 'effort', 'soldiers', 'Autobots', 'taking', 'down', 'Decepticons', 'loved', 'were', 'more', 'Transformers', 'overall', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'liked', 'dead', 'depiction', 'current', 'administration', 'World', 'Apology', 'tour', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'Obama', 'blaming', 'Autobots', 'destruction', 'Decepticons', 'caused', 'asking', 'leave', 'turning', 'Sam', 'Megatron', 'Fallen']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

Bumblebee is left behind but does still follow Sam even in disguise as his friends such as Optimus Prime (Voiced by Peter Cullen) with Ratchet (Voiced by Robert Foxworth) and Ironhide (Voiced by Jess Harnell) plus other new autobots like Skids (Voiced by Tom Kenny), Wheelie (Voiced by Tom Kenny), Mudflap, Arcee and others have had their battle with the Decepticons especially Starscream (Voiced by Charles Adler). Sam however has one of the last remaining pieces of the all-spark then something goes haywire went it's powers go into his brain making him a bit smarter, more frantic and fast paced like never before like if he had a rush of some kind especially writing weird transformers type languages on paper and some kind of supernatural ability. An ancient Decepticon named ""The Fallen"" (Voiced by Tony Todd) has arrived on Earth seeking revenge but while he's at it, Sam has became a target for Megatron (Voiced by Hugo Weaving) and other decepticons must seek an ancient device hidden in Egypt that can unleash doom into the world.Co-starring Megan Fox back as Mikaela, Isobel Lucas, Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel this is a very entertaining and well paced sequel that is actually four stars. Sure some of the jokes are crude yet tasteless and weak at times including former Decepticon Jetfire (Voiced by Mark Jones) being one of those old-man jokes to even humping stuff but there is a few good hilarious moments. The acting is quite good, the action sequences are breathtaking as usual from Michael Bay as they are better than the first and amazing CGI even thought ""Avatar"" has the best visual effects of 2009. We get more Transformers such as Wheelie (Voiced by Tom Kenny), Soundwave (Voiced by Frank Welker), and Skipjack (Voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) and sometimes it's a bit racist with those 2 robots being punk-hip hop stereotypes even goofy looking but annoying at times. What more can you want when you can turn off your brain and have some fun despite what lousy critics said.This 2-Disc Blu-Ray Wal Mart edition is PHENOMENAL with amazing big screen IMAX style picture and flawless sound quality like never. The extras are fantastic such as commentary, documentary called Human Factor which takes you behind the scenes, Destructing Visual Bayhem which gives you multi-angel sequences, NEST: Transformer Data Hub which tells you files of Transformers in quality 3D including history, The Blu-Ray exclusive called Allspark Experiment, 25 years of transformers featurette, deleted and alternate scenes, giant effing movie which is a semi behind the scenes montage, music video by Linkin Park and of course Trailers, TV Spots and galleries.",5,Outstanding Blu-Ray for a enjoyable follow-up!,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,2812,"['events', 'first', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'Sam', 'Spike', 'Witwicky', 'Shia', 'Lebeouf', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'now', 'becoming', 'college', 'student', 'Bumblebee', 'left', 'still', 'follow', 'Sam', 'even', 'disguise', 'friends', 'such', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'Voiced', 'Peter', 'Cullen', 'Ratchet', 'Voiced', 'Robert', 'Foxworth', 'Ironhide', 'Voiced', 'Jess', 'Harnell', 'other', 'new', 'autobots', 'Skids', 'Voiced', 'Tom', 'Kenny', 'Wheelie', 'Voiced', 'Tom', 'Kenny', 'Mudflap', 'Arcee', 'others', 'have', 'had', 'battle', 'Decepticons', 'especially', 'Starscream', 'Voiced', 'Charles', 'Adler', 'Sam', 'however', 'one', 'last', 'remaining', 'pieces', 'all-spark', 'then', 'something', 'haywire', 'went', 'powers', 'go', 'brain', 'making', 'bit', 'smarter', 'more', 'frantic', 'fast', 'paced', 'never', 'had', 'rush', 'kind', 'especially', 'writing', 'weird', 'transformers', 'type', 'languages', 'paper', 'kind', 'supernatural', 'ability', 'ancient', 'Decepticon', 'named', 'Fallen', 'Voiced', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'arrived', 'Earth', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'Sam', 'became', 'target', 'Megatron', 'Voiced', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'other', 'decepticons', 'must', 'seek', 'ancient', 'device', 'hidden', 'Egypt', 'can', 'unleash', 'doom', 'world.Co-starring', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'back', 'Mikaela', 'Isobel', 'Lucas', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'very', 'entertaining', 'well', 'paced', 'sequel', 'actually', 'four', 'stars', 'Sure', 'jokes', 'are', 'crude', 'yet', 'tasteless', 'weak', 'times', 'including', 'former', 'Decepticon', 'Jetfire', 'Voiced', 'Mark', 'Jones', 'being', 'one', 'old-man', 'jokes', 'even', 'humping', 'stuff', 'few', 'good', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'usual', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'are', 'better', 'first', 'amazing', 'CGI', 'even', 'thought', 'Avatar', 'best', 'visual', 'effects', '2009', 'get', 'more', 'Transformers', 'such', 'Wheelie', 'Voiced', 'Tom', 'Kenny', 'Soundwave', 'Voiced', 'Frank', 'Welker', 'Skipjack', 'Voiced', 'Kevin', 'Michael', 'Richardson', 'bit', 'racist', '2', 'robots', 'being', 'punk-hip', 'hop', 'stereotypes', 'even', 'goofy', 'looking', 'annoying', 'times', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'want', 'when', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'have', 'fun', 'what', 'lousy', 'critics', 'said.This', '2-Disc', 'Blu-Ray', 'Wal', 'Mart', 'edition', 'PHENOMENAL', 'amazing', 'big', 'screen', 'IMAX', 'style', 'picture', 'flawless', 'sound', 'quality', 'never', 'extras', 'are', 'fantastic', 'such', 'commentary', 'documentary', 'called', 'Human', 'Factor', 'scenes', 'Destructing', 'Visual', 'Bayhem', 'multi-angel', 'sequences', 'NEST', 'Transformer', 'Data', 'Hub', 'files', 'Transformers', 'quality', '3D', 'including', 'history', 'Blu-Ray', 'exclusive', 'called', 'Allspark', 'Experiment', '25', 'years', 'transformers', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'giant', 'effing', 'movie', 'semi', 'scenes', 'montage', 'music', 'video', 'Linkin', 'Park', 'course', 'Trailers', 'TV', 'Spots', 'galleries']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

The computer artists are the only real talent that shows up on screen.  The script and dialogue sound like they were written by an 8th grader.  The film itself looks like a long music video.  Sometimes the camera will just NOT STOP MOVING.  It makes one dizzy after a while.  I guess the director and cameraman get mileage points.Some of the sexual content is WAY too inappropriate for the younger portion of the target audience.Shia LeBeouf looks like he's wearing a spray-on tan.""The bigger they are, the harder they fall.""  Remember that, Megan Fox, when you are no longer the Hottie of the Moment.This movie, like the one before it and the three Star Wars prequels, was made to show off how spiffy the effects can look and THAT'S ALL.  No intelligent or coherent script.  This film is meant to be EYE CANDY ONLY.Kind of disappointing, too.  So much potential with the effects and budget, yet they took the ""low road"" in the Brains department.For the record, I didn't pay to see it (nor would I).  I snuck into the screening room after leaving a showing of ""Public Enemies"".  Not a single Space Robot in ""Public Enemies"" and yet it was a far, far superior film.  Go figure.Michael Bay movies have become their own genre:  loud, visually impressive, and dumb as a bucket of hair.  I don't think it bothers him or the studios for one nanosecond that so many people hate his films for being dumb and badly directed.  I don't think he's even trying to make a good film any more.  He specializes in Junk Food Cinema, and that's all you will likely ever get from him.He takes advantage of moviegoers with low standards.  And he'll laugh all the way to the bank.  One of these days he's gonna make a film so bad even his devoted fans won't like it.  But by then he'll be so rich he won't care, if he's not already.  Wait!  That's it!  He's ALREADY so rich he doesn't have to care!  THAT'S why his movies stink so bad.Believe me, the only artistically talented contributors to his films are sitting in air-conditioned offices at ILM and the other effects houses.

After the first film, people said that there were not enough transformers in it, there wasn't enough plot, and there wasn't enough action. Now that they finally got what they wanted, they say it's bad? Seriously, they need to get their thoughts straight. Plus, they're saying it was targeted to kids and stuff. However, this movie is based on a show for kids just in case you didn't know. Just get real already.Now that that's taken care of, let's go onto the review.I watched this movie on iMax and it was a blast. The special effects, the action, and the plot. They seriously did it the right way. You get to see way more transformers than in the previous movie and bigger ones as well (just like in the anime). There's is also more comedy than before with a bigger plot. Those who watched the anime series would know the connection that exist between humans and the transformers just as shown in the first movie, but it is more solid in the second one. Also, the movie is almost as long as the first one but with more action. They are constantly at war and they tell the story as the continuous war progresses. You've got more involvement of the characters from the first one as well as newcomers from all sides. The special effects are superb. It's like watching Transformers remake with a deeper story.In conclusion, this movie is accessible to fans of the series as well as people who didn't even watch the first one since they kind of re-tell the events of the first film. We've seen movies like Dragon Ball and Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li fail since they try to re-create the story that has already been implanted in the world. Transformers was a little off the edge in the first movie, but in this second film, they really got on track.

1164147,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0019M5C0Q,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[4, 10]","In 2007, the often critically maligned, yet still box office powerhouse, director Michael Bay (""Pearl Harbor"") presented us with his vision of bringing gigantic transforming robots to life on the big screen. It was big, bold, loud, funny, and above all incredibly entertaining, not to mention taking many audience members by surprise in terms of just how much fun the movie was. I mean seriously, here was a movie based on an animated series from the 80's that was itself based on a toy line from Hasbro. How could that movie be anything but absurd? Yet, somehow Bay and his writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (""Star Trek"") found a way to make it work that was believable and enjoyable to audiences, thus leading to an incredible amount of money being spent at the box office. Which brings us to the summer of 2009; two years after the initial movie blew audiences away, the inevitable sequel to the smash hit ""Transformers"" has arrived.""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" picks up approximately two years after the events in the first film. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is preparing to head off to college sans girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) and car/guardian Bumblebee. However, Sam's higher learning shall have to wait as the evil Decepticons have returned to Earth at the behest of their overlord, The Fallen, to locate an ancient artifact of Cybertronian origin that is hidden somewhere on the planet. If the Decepticons locate the relic it would spell certain doom for humanity and the Autobots. Now, Optimus Prime and company must band together to fight their deadliest foes in an effort to ensure that Earth and its people have not seen their last days.If you saw the original film, and judging by the box office numbers not too many people didn't, then you kind of know what may be in store for you with the sequel. Everything that worked so well in the previous movie is back, bigger and better than ever for this one. Not to diminish how great ""Transformers"" was as a movie, because it was incredible; however in my opinion, it was simply the opening act, and ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is the main event.If you presumed that this film was going to be a visual effects extravaganza with a plethora of explosions, then you would be correct; however, it isn't just a brainless exercise in blockbuster movie making courtesy of Michael Bay as some would have you believe. Written by returning screenwriting duo Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, along with writer Ehren Kruger (""The Ring Two""), the story for ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is much more epic and grand in both scope and size than that of the previous film. In conjunction with all of the visually intensive action sequences, the writing team maintained the quick-witted banter of Sam, increased the presence of his romance with girlfriend Mikaela, and built upon the friendship and camaraderie between him and the Autobots. The film also has some quieter, more introspective moments, as Sam struggles with being a young adult trying to discover who he will be as a man. Meanwhile, he is also keeping secret the fact that his car is a member of an alien race hiding amongst us and that certain members of that alien race may return someday to destroy him and everything he cares about. Talk about having some internal baggage to carry with you. All of these story elements together create a movie experience that has more going for it than being just another mindless action flick.The original film was truly an achievement in the realm of visual effects by making giant, life-like, transforming robots into a reality. With the sequel, the talented crew at Industrial Light and Magic have topped themselves yet again by delivering an even bigger smorgasbord of extremely detailed (as they were in the first one) Transformers to feast our eyes upon. Plus, because of the fact that their arrival on Earth had already been chronicled in the first film, this one allows us to see the two warring sides of this alien race much sooner, and they are much more prominent in the story as a result. I didn't know how far technology had come in the realm of CGI in the short time since the previous movie, but it appears that the capabilities these wizards now possess are leaps and bounds above what was available two years ago. For me, ""Revenge of the Fallen"" possibly sets the new standard for visual effects by which all other movies may be judged.Returning to join the Autobots in their war against the Decepticons are the two leads in the film, Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox, as Sam and Mikaela. Their two characters have matured quite a bit since the last movie, and are now trying to find their place in the outside world. Both characters are also more proactive in this film, and are working hand-in-hand with the Autobots in the effort to thwart the Decepticons' evil plans. Another aspect of their roles worth mentioning is that their relationship onscreen is very believable, and their commitment to each other in the trying times that follow is a commendable trait that is often found lacking in today's society.Alongside Shia and Megan are supporting cast members John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, and Tyrese Gibson. All of these supporting characters are given more to do this time around. Although the characters of Lennox and Epps (Josh and Tyrese respectively) command more respect than last we saw them, it is Turturro's eccentric former Sector 7 Agent Simmons that has undergone the most change. No longer an agent of the government, Simmons has been relegated to working for his mother. I liked Turturro's performance in the original film, but his work in this one is even more enjoyable, and his eccentricity seems even better suited to his character now that he is a civilian.Also returning for more are character actors Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents. In this movie their characters are featured a little bit more in the story, still not major players, but the time they do get on the screen they make the very best of. Both offer several moments of levity, especially Julie White, but we also get to see them go through the difficulty as a parent having to let go of a child who's growing up. Hopefully we will get to see even more from them in the inevitable third film.Lastly, the actors giving voice to the various Transformers once again do an excellent job of bringing these characters to life. From returning talents Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime) and Hugo Weaving (Megatron) to newcomers Frank Welker (Soundwave), Tony Todd (The Fallen), and Tom Kenny (Skids), each member delivers a solid performance that perfectly compliments the flawless computer-generated imagery that created these robots. One last thing regarding the voice-over actors, to be truthful saying Frank Welker is a newcomer to Transformers only applies to this movie. In reality, Welker provided many of the voices in the original animated series, most notably those of Megatron and Soundwave.Boasting an even bigger scope, more action, humor, and almost 3-times as many robots than its predecessor, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a pulse-pounding, fast-paced thrill ride that will entertain you from beginning to end.""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",5,Much More Than Meets the Eye...,1246579200,"07 3, 2009",2009,7291,"['2007', 'often', 'critically', 'maligned', 'yet', 'still', 'box', 'office',

I owned all the toys, comics, and other fan-related merchandise. I even watched the original film on VHS so much that the tape turned to shreds. Since a kid, I've been dying to see a live-action film made of one of my most beloved franchises. Enter Michael Bay and all my childhood fantasies of seeing a great Transformers film have been ruined.I was not happy with the direction of the first film. In fact, even though I hated it, I felt it did have some redeeming qualities which made it at least worth watching. With that said, I dreaded seeing the sequel. But nothing could have prepared me for just how terrible Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is. There have been some real sci-fi stinkers released at the movies over the years (Streetfighter, Mortal Kombat 2, Godzilla, Highlander 4, Matrix Revolutions, Attack of the Clones, etc). But until watching RotF, I have never left the theater feeling as though all of my brain cells had died from watching a film. Only reason I didn't walk out of this movie is because I had gone to see it with a friend. Without a doubt, RotF is the single most mindless piece of garbage filmmaking I have ever seen in my life.The positives:-Some well-choreographed action scenes.-Improved battle scenes between the Transformers.-Megan Fox-Peter Cullen/Frank WelkerThe negatives:-Way too much cursing (even for a PG-13 movie).-Too many raunchy scenes-Toilet humor.-Bad acting.-God awful script.-Nonsensical plot.-Terrible robot design.-Racist ""black-face"" vaudeville robots.-Too much Mom and Dad-Excessive running time.-Shia Lebeouf-Michael BayIt's a testament to how dumb our culture has gotten when a film as crude, silly, and tasteless as RotF can go on to become one of the highest grossing films in history. Thanks to the success of this mindless film, it's a good bet that Hollywood is sure to make fewer good films in the future in order to spit out more rubbish like RotF.I am convinced that so long as Michael Bay is at the helm, I will never watch another live-action Transformer movie. In fact, I will probably never watch another Michael Bay film period.My advice to anyone with half of a brain or even an ounce of good taste is to save your money and stay far away from this despicable train-wreck!Zero Stars.",1,Easily the worst movie I have ever seen.,1257292800,"11 4, 2009",2009,2364,"['Gen-Xer', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Transformers', 'zealotry', 'only', 'surpassed', 'love', 'Star', 'Wars', 'owned', 'toys', 'comics', 'other', 'fan-related', 'merchandise', 'even', 'watched', 'original', 'film', 'VHS', 'so', 'much', 'tape', 'turned', 'shreds', 'kid', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dying', 'see', 'live-action', 'film', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'franchises', 'Enter', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'childhood', 'fantasies', 'seeing', 'great', 'Transformers', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'ruined.I', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'direction', 'first', 'film', 'fact', 'even', 'hated', 'felt', 'did', 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'made', 'least', 'worth', 'watching', 'said', 'dreaded', 'seeing', 'sequel', 'nothing', 'could', 'have', 'prepared', 'just', 'how', 'terrible', 'Transformers', '2', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'sci-fi', 'stinkers', 'released', 'movies', 'years', 'Streetfighter', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', '2', 'Godzilla', 'Highlander', '4', 'Matrix', 'Revolutions', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'etc', 'watching', 'RotF', 'have', 'never', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', 'brain', 'cells', 'had', 'died', 'watching', 'film', 'Only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'walk', 'movie', 'had', 'gone', 'see', 'friend', 'doubt', 'RotF', 'single', 'most', 'mindless', 'piece', 'garbage', 'filmmaking', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life.The', 'positives', '-Some', 'well-choreographed', 'action', 'scenes.-Improved', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Transformers.-Megan', 'Fox-Peter', 'Cullen/Frank', 'WelkerThe', 'negatives', '-Way', 'too', 'much', 'cursing', 'even', 'PG-13', 'movie', '.-Too', 'many', 'raunchy', 'scenes-Toilet', 'humor.-Bad', 'acting.-God', 'awful', 'script.-Nonsensical', 'plot.-Terrible', 'robot', 'design.-Racist', 'black-face', 'robots.-Too', 'much', 'Mom', 'Dad-Excessive', 'running', 'time.-Shia', 'Lebeouf-Michael', 'BayIt', 'testament', 'how', 'dumb', 'culture', 'gotten', 'when', 'film', 'crude', 'silly', 'tasteless', 'RotF', 'can', 'go', 'become', 'one', 'highest', 'grossing', 'films', 'history', 'Thanks', 'success', 'mindless', 'film', 'good', 'bet', 'Hollywood', 'sure', 'make', 'fewer', 'good', 'films', 'future', 'order', 'spit', 'out', 'more', 'rubbish', 'RotF.I', 'am', 'convinced', 'so', 'long', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'helm', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'live-action', 'Transformer', 'movie', 'fact', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'watch', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'film', 'period.My', 'advice', 'anyone', 'half', 'brain', 'even', 'ounce', 'good', 'taste', 'save', 'money', 'stay', 'far', 'away', 'despicable', 'train-wreck', 'Zero', 'Stars']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

I enjoyed the action (I'm easily entertained when it comes to movies with lots of gratuitous sex and violence), but don't expect much in the way of nuanced acting. The story line here, however, is stronger than in the first movie and the transformers themselves even more impressive, and with some very human personality quirks in some cases. Fans of C3PO and R2D2 will see that famous pair of robot friends reprised here in the two goofy, smaller transformers.For me this was a four star movie just for the entertainment value. For someone with more movie acumen than me it might be more like a three-star. Just my perhaps uninformed opinion.

Michael Bay certainly gets props for creativity and trying to squeeze an entertaining story from thin air, but this movie like ALL of his movies, is like sitting thru a 2 hour movie trailer. The guy just doesn't stop to give gravitas to ANY scene, longer than a few seconds, before the camera is zipping to the next shot. Some people might appreciate that for the rapid fire action that also follows suit, but it get VERY old for me after 30 minutes or so. This one, like the first, have dazzling special effects that are enough to enjoy all by themselves. The story and hyperactive shot editing are bad enough that I didn't even care to see how this turned out, also just like the first one. I quit watching about an hour in, even by then the CGI'd effects become rote. If ever I became a film director , and wanted a guy to put together an adrenalin and action packed trailer, Michael Bay is the guy I'd call. For anything longer than that....pass. I found the most entertaining part of the movie to be LeBouf's parents, that was a hoot. Maybe Bay should try his hand at a comedy next.

1164172,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B0019M5C0Q,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[5, 8]","The first movieI enjoyed a lot.  Sure, it was silly and cheesy, but within the movie's concept of ""logic,"" it was both forgiveable and fun.  It was exactly what I expected it to be, no more and no less.This film was much, much less.  So much less that even the spectacular fight scenes grew tiresome and monotonous.Here's the skinny:The plot is breath-takingly idiotic.  Sam's home is beseiged by a dozen or so tiny (and seemingly spontaneous) Decepticon bots right before he leaves for college.  Bumblebee jumps in and (chaotically) saves the day.  Moments later, Sam tells Bumblebee that he isn't taking the Autobot with him to college for reasons that make no sense whatsoever.  Add to this an annoying and absurd subplot about Sam having difficulty saying the ""love"" word to his uber-perfect girlfriend.About that girlfriend: scriptwriters, please give your characters flaws.  Megan Fox's character is perfect in every conceivable way, from her patience with Sam to the sultry way she bends over engines as she fixes them.  She and Sam have endured life-changing (and -threatening) situations together, and yet, Sam still can't bring himself to tell her how much she means to him.  As soon as the couple begins arguing about the ""L"" word, you know immediately what the climax of the film will entail.The Earth has also been beset with an unusually high number of violent and high-profile Decepticon attacks.  In the face of this, what does the American government do?  In the greatest plot contrivance of all, a liason from the president not only kicks the Autobots off the planet, he does so with a speech that conveniently (for the audience and the Decepticon) lays out every weakness and detail of the country's experience with the Transformers.These are just a few of the film's gaping holes.  In order to distract from these, the creators added the following window dressing, ostensibly to titillate and amuse:--a pointless scene involving Sam's mom and some illegal brownies--two jive-talking robots with golden buck teeth and huge ears; when these characters first appeared, I turned to a friend who had come with me to the IMAX and said, ""Is it just me, or are those things racist?""  My friend held up his forefinger and thumb and said, ""Yeah.  Just a bit.""--a new kind of Decepticon that stretches credulity; let's just say it can shift into some really hot shapes--the robots are given more human characteristics than ever before, including breath, farts, and anatomically correct groinsOther things I couldn't help but notice:--it takes the Decepticons roughly five minutes to break into and take over a top-secret, ultra-secure military compound, but they have an extraordinary amount of difficulty stealing a purse from an 18 year old girl on a motorbike--Sam's dormroom is so full of gorgeous coeds that they actually have a character explain the abnormal ratio of hot chicks--Rainn Wilson is under-utilized as a smarmy professor in a classroom scene that contributes almost nothing to the plot--a military official, when he receives an anonymous transmission from a character telling him to fire the government's most dangerous, most top secret weapon at one of the three pyramids in Egypt only hesitates about half a second before going ahead and doing it--Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox have absolutely no chemistry this time around; it took me about five minutes to realize that they were flirting when they started talking about breaking up.See it for the fight scenes, I guess, but try not to think too hard.

It stared some of them, but this movie had absolutely nothing to do with them. This was more like watching a script that was meant to be part of another movie, then adapted to be a Transformers movie. The producers just threw in additional autobots that have nothing to do with the Transformers franchise. The story doesn't even go in line with the concept of the Transformers. Why fabricate a villian no one has ever heard of, when there are PLENTY and I mean PLENTY! of major Decepticon villians they could have introduced... like Hello UNICRON!I also don't understand why the major players from the TV show are made to seem as extra's and lackies in these movies. Star Scream was never a coward he was always ready to take control. He never feared Megatron so why does he become his rag doll in the movie? I don't get why the producers decided to create so many new and unheard of decepticons. The Decepticons have their own squad of recognized soldiers just like the Autobots do. They did it in the last film so why are they so absent in this one?I was really dissapointed with this film, and while I thought the first one was ""ok"" aside from the Transformations being too technical it was an enjoyable film. Revenge of the Fallen is makes ""Batman and Robin"" (the one with george clooney)look like ""The Dark Night"". This film is absolutely terrible, and for a show made originally for children to watch, there is no way any child under the ager of ""21"" could watch this film. There is just too much foul language, sexually suggestive themes, and adult humor going on in this film. I was really suprised to see all of these vulgarities in a ""Transformers"" movie. Even if it is live action, it's still a story made for children (I know because Optimus Prime and GI Joe raised me). It was more like a slap in the face to anyone that loves transformers. They took a series that was made to teach kids moral principles about life and turned it into a film with a decepticon humping a girls leg. I mean they just took a dump on my childhood Saturday mornings and I didn't appreciate that.I've never been a fan of Michael Bay's films, and seeing Revenge of the Fallen reminded me why.

And the explosions - I liked the nice big one at the end - were nice eye-candy.But the story was the best they could do considering the Writer's Strike of last year. With all the new robots, it's hard to create a character-driven story like the last one (what am I saying?!?!?!).You can definitely tell how Michael Bay feels about President Obama and his foreign policy. The jabs given are aimed at liberals and those who aren't too keen on the U.S. military. Speaking of the military, they really get to shine and explode in this film as they do most Michael Bay films.Even though it's raking in the big bucks (think Spider-Man 3), people will remember this sequel as another poor attempt at milking a franchise.

Herzog,"[3, 6]","When the first Transformers came out, I thought there was no way that transformers could possibly work on the big screen (the concepts of being a giant robot one moment, then a car the next seemed rather uninteresting).  However, when I saw the movie, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a great balance of action and comedy, and left me excited at the prospect of a sequel.  So this time I was excited for it, expecting it to surpass the original, in every way.  Sadly, the sequel greatly failed at every turn.  Rather than find a way to improve on the original, everything was more...much more.  Did you like the robot fights in the first transformers?  There's a lot more of those.  Wanted more transformers?  There's a ton here.  What about explosions and stuff blowing up?  There's that in spades.But that's the problem...there's only more without any real improvements.  There's so many transformers that sometimes its hard to tell who is the good guys and who are the bad, making the multiple fights rather un-impressive.  There's so many explosions that you're almost numb to them half way through.  Rather than space everything out so there's some impact, its explosion, fight, explosion, fight, brief moment of story, explosion, fight, etc.  By the end, you're numb to everything.  So numb that you actually pay attention to the plot which makes no sense.  Why can only a prime kill the Fallen?  He doesn't have a special power, there's no electric reason, and they never mention any programming issue.  All prime does is bludgeon him anyway, so why couldn't anyone have done that.  Why is there a transformer heaven?  How are we supposed to believe building high machines are still a secret from the general public?I guess the real problem is that there was no heart in the movie.  While I know the first was a product of corporate moguls, it didn't quite feel that way.  It felt like something fun and entertaining.  This felt like every scene had someone saying ""more explosions"" or ""more fights.""

The first Tranformers movie dealt with the robots being discovered for the first time.  That can't be re-created for the sequel.  One had to know going in that this movie would be pretty much good robots vs. bad robots.  And that's exactly what it was.Yes, the movie is flawed here and there.  There may be a few too many Michael Bay-esque shots...you know, slow-mo explosions, a quick shot of a plane flying with the sound of radio traffic, pilots jogging (in slow motion) towards their planes, etc.  There's not a very solid plot; it's good robots vs. bad robots.  Some of the dialogue is silly.  And there are a few less than believable scenes.But so what?  This is a fun, loud, exciting movie.  A perfect turn off your brain summer flick.  The special effects are very good.  There are some very cool scenes involving the robots, and the Decepticons steal the show with some new additions and one huge robot made up of many others.I didn't feel that the movie was too long.  It didn't seem like 2 and a half hours.  I suppose the nearly constant action helped with that.  My 6-year old son and I watched it and both enjoyed it a lot.  He told me he didn't want it to end (and I suppose it won't with more sequels to come for sure).I'm not one to bash other reviewers (although I think there are A LOT of Michael Bay haters in the movie critic population).  But a few of the comments I saw in reviews here make me shake my head.  One of the repeated complaints was the language and some of the adult humor.  Without going on a tirade here, I just wanted to point out that this movie is rated PG-13.  A PG-13 movie is not a family movie.  Some scenes may not be suitable for those under the age of 13.  I'll leave it at that.Overall, Transformers, Revenge of the Fallen is not better than the original.  It's different.  It's an action movie, and a pretty good one with cool action scenes, great special effects, exciting new robots, and a lot of humor.  Turn off your brain, sit back, and enjoy.

1164190,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0019M5C0Q,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 4]","Michael Bay is known for making loud, expensive, visually arresting, utterly shallow films, but like so many directors his reputation is often a broad caricature than reality. Even Uwe Boll has made some decent films. But ""Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen"" is every awful thing about Bay rolled into one big dumb movie.Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBouf) is at it again, after he discovers a piece of the Cube. He's off to college, so of course his pet Autobot Bumblebee is upset. So is his smoking hot girlfriend (smoking hot Megan Fox), who reluctantly agrees to keep up a long distance relationship. Because, you know, she has no other options and Sam is really funny.Meanwhile, the Autobots are told to bug off by the U.S Military, who is tired of having all these robots blowing up exotic locations in blurry melees. So Optimus Prime agrees to leave humanity to its fate. This is a bad thing, of course, because Megatron has slunk off to his progenitor's planet to ask for reinforcement. This guy, who looks like an angry aborigine robot, is the titular Fallen mentioned in the title.What ensues is a series of fights interspersed with broad and offensive stereotypes of robots with human-like traits. The worst are the two brothers who look and talk like urban punks, complete with gold buck teeth. Bay obviously thinks it's not offensive if ugly racial stereotypes are dressed up as robots.But really, the most offensive thing about this film is that it exists. It's a blend of everything awful about big budget films, from the hot supporting actress who stands around stretching and sighing to robots speaking in slang to giant robot conflicts that are nigh-impossible to follow with the eye.It all culminates with a death that's not a death since it lasts about twenty minutes, a contrived reason to make the miniscule humans relevant to the plot, and Megatron slinking away to fight again another day. I could characterize the film as a very expensive cartoon episode, but that would be an insult to the Transformer cartoons that started it all.The first installment of Transformers was big, brash, and undeniably American, fetishizing our country's military might and love of big cars.

Let's be real- this product is very much marketing to kids under 13 years of age, and the only reason this thing didn't get a hard R rating is because the filmmakers had enough money to bargain for whatever rating they wanted. It's absolutely sickening that this is the state of Hollywood.Don't get me wrong- I'm not a religious person nor am I masquerading as a reviewer for a family website. I love action movies and explosions, and I even like appropriate racial commentary when it's done right. I don't appreciate scene after scene of mindless special effects interspersed with gradeschool-level humor from a junior-level director.If you think watching robots who walk around like gorillas, talking in ebonics, with gold teeth, saying they ""don't read much"" (I am really not kidding- there's two of them), is a fine way to spend two and a half hours, then may Vector Sigma have mercy on your spark. Having an obviously ethnic stereotype made up as an Autobot in the first movie call the group ""[...]"" was already appalling- why take it further? Answer: Because people will pay money to see it, apparently.Some will say that this is all subjective. Maybe the twins aren't really that racist, maybe it's okay for kids to see a robot with visible testicles (again, not kidding), and maybe more than one shot of dogs humping is justified somehow by the plot (I wish I was making this up!). Even if you wanted to try and grant all that, you still have to admit that the plot makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and there are holes big enough to ride Devastator through. Why for example are metal robots grown in organic space-sacs, which not only contradicts all source material, but just doesn't make sense anyway? And you'd still have Michael Bay's terrible filmmaking, where there are too many quick cuts and the shakey camera is zoomed in too far on the action. With the overly complex robot designs, battles are often unintelligible blurs of gray and brown with random blocks of primary color thrown in for reference points.The final justification by fans, over and over, is that this is just a kids' movie, and hey the original 1980s cartoon was pretty cheesy.

1164199,A3RFCBJ6U5DLFN,B0019M5C0Q,MisterMusicFan,"[12, 23]","`Transformers 2: Revenge of The Fallen' is a marvel for two reasons: it opened to some of the most alarmingly bad critic reviews in history, as well as one of the most alarmingly successful box office grosses in history. Needless to say, the two aren't generally expected to go hand in hand. So who's right? The critics or the audiences? Well I suppose neither party can be `right' in this particular scenario, because apparently `Transformers' can be critically panned until the cows come home, and it wouldn't make a square inch of difference to the oceans of consumers flooding into theaters, eager to see the massively hyped film-or at least its skanktacular stars.Apparently even reps for the movie itself are taking heed to the windfall of horrifyingly bad critic reviews: Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount (distributor of the film for DreamWorks), recently released a statement, claiming, ""Critics forget what the goal of the movie was/to entertain and have fun. What the audience tells us is, `We couldn't be more entertained and having more fun.' They kind of roll their eyes at the critics and say, `You have no idea what you're talking about'."" Well, the latter half of the statement couldn't be more true; I'm sure the critics and consumerist-culture audiences are indeed rolling their eyes at one another, not having the idlest idea where the other is coming from.`Transformers 2' has moderately entertaining moments but isn't very `fun' at all; minus a handful of averagely entertaining jokes and some as-usual CGI flare, the movie is a total stinker, in every sense of the word, from start to finish. The plot is painfully contrived and out-of-nowhere, and begins just as jarringly and spastically as the film's headache-inducing editing. After some melodramatic, wannabe-epic words from Optimus, the movie opens to a random robotic brawl on the streets of somewhere, and already most audiences would walk away feeling as if they'd been bludgeoned by an enormous metal object. Sam Witwicky is heading off to college, and we're briefly treated to miniscule nuggets of hilarity thanks to his comic-relief parents, but mere minutes into the film even what they have to offer is beaten senselessly into the ground. From there, Megan Fox bends over on a motorcycle, speaks in her nauseating, Anna Nicole Smith-like drawl, has a random gratuitous wardrobe change, and whines over Sam not loving her. Meanwhile, Sam makes the convenient discovery of a fragment of the AllSpark cube on his shirt (which apparently hadn't been washed since the first movie), more random robot chaos ensues, and mom eats a pot brownie. Are we having fun yet?`Transformers 2' is completely void of a single shred of the originality or actual fun of the `Transformers' franchise, and children who are fans of the toys should not see this movie-for multiple reasons. The film is amuck with sex jokes and toilet humor, very, very little of which most parents would find suitable for the kids who actually play with the Transformers toys. There's lots of humping, both by the Witwicky pets and by robots (yes, I'm serious), and the attempts at appealing to older audiences come in the form of rampant cussing, dolled-up pinup eye candy and morbidly unfunny sexual humor (the whole bit about Sam's mom parading her son's loss of virginity during the pot brownie scene was really, really unnecessary, and tries pathetically hard to cater to the most simple-minded of people).And then of course there's the action. They couldn't have added more if they tried. There's robotic arms, legs, and assorted other limbs flailing about in just about every square inch of the movie, but at this point the `look what we can do' approach to CGI doesn't impress anymore. It's easy to dismiss a movie's drawbacks at least partially with the common comment of `oh, well, the special effects were pretty cool.' The special effects are absolutely all `Transformers' has to rely on at this point, what with the witless, soulless sitcom parading itself as the human characters' side story as the only available alternative. The special effects are impressive, but they don't impress, if that makes sense-in an era where CGI is the standard for movies of this type, you need more than just flashy special effects to make a decent movie, and unfortunately `T2' doesn't even manage to reach that level of decency.`Transformers' also manages to be offensive on many levels, the most shocking of which is the introduction of Ebonics-speaking, appallingly stereotyped Mudflap and Skids, whose attempt at `comedic relief' retards comedy back to the days of blackface and racial slandering. Michael Bay was clearly very ambitious with this movie, but this big, lumbering, idiotic, overwhelming, slobbering mess it turned out to be does not properly embody the efforts of his ambition. Unless you want to be overwhelmed, dumbfounded, offended, and stupefied within the unbearably long span of 147 minutes, don't see 'Transformers 2.' Or do. Everyone else has anyway. As modern-day pop culture consumerists, we are after all programmed to naturally migrate to pop culture phenomena, regardless of how astoundingly bad or un-entertaining it may be.

I know that's not saying much, but it had unique SFX that should have won the Oscar and a sense of fun throughout. Revenge of the Fallen has even better visuals and a whole lot more action, but the dialogue and script are really weak this time around. There are a bunch of scenes that try way too hard to be funny and the addition of two ""black"" sounding robots who claim they can't read, brings back horrible memories of Jar Jar Binks. Shia Labeouf is okay in the first half of the movie, but he is given little to do or say after that.There are a couple of things that left me no choice other than giving it three stars. The SFX are outstanding and you can see more of what is happening in the fights. Megan Fox is not even close to being a good actress, but she is really something to look at. Michael Bay loves showing her off, especially her gorgeous face. The other hot girl (Isabel Lucas) tries to seduce Shia's character in college and she is near perfect in the looks department as well.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a long movie and it feels that way, but I was entertained enough to say it is worth seeing in theaters if you liked the first movie.",3,It's sensory overload time,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,1250,"['first', 'Transformers', 'far', 'great', 'was', 'one', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'best', 'films', 'know', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'had', 'unique', 'SFX', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'sense', 'fun', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'even', 'better', 'visuals', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'action', 'dialogue', 'script', 'are', 'really', 'weak', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'bunch', 'scenes', 'try', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'addition', 'two', 'black', 'sounding', 'robots', 'who', 'claim', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'back', 'horrible', 'memories', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'Shia', 'Labeouf', 'okay', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'given', 'little', 'do', 'say', 'are', 'couple', 'things', 'left', 'choice', 'other', 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'SFX', 'are', 'outstanding', 'can', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'happening', 'fights', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'being', 'good', 'actress', 'really', 'something', 'look', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'showing', 'off', 'especially', 'gorgeous', 'face', 'other', 'hot', 'girl', 'Isabel', 'Lucas', 'seduce', 'Shia', 'character', 'college', 'near', 'perfect', 'looks', 'department', 'well.Transformers', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'long', 'movie', 'way', 'was', 'entertained', 'enough', 'say', 'worth', 'seeing', 'theaters', 'liked', 'first', 'movie']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

Do moviegoers just want sequel after sequel that only adds to the franchise by cramming in more stuff? Has the 'more is always better' theory started to dominate film making to such an extent that we'll go gladly dump our money (myself included) on a movie this poorly made just because it promises more flash special effects and lots of explosions? I hope this isn't true, but judging by this movie's success at the box office, it just might be.Other reviewers have adequately described most of the major problems with the film, but there were a few things that actually made me sad watching REVENGE OF THE FALLEN. The first and primary is that Optimus Prime (probably the coolest Transformer in my opinion) is given very few lines--a major mistake considering he is the only 'serious' Transformer, and voiced by a fantastic voice actor who dates back to the original Transformers cartoon. The film reveals that he is the very last 'Prime' Transformer, the most powerful that exist in the universe. This could be a remarkably cool story in itself, but the film is so filled up with other nonsense that Optimus is left on the sidelines (literally due to one of the most anticlimactic action sequences of the film which leaves him incapacitated). He is the voice of moral authority and wisdom in the original series, in the previous Hollywood offering, and in REVENGE as well. So why give him so few lines and why leave his character undeveloped?Another sad thing is the brazenly idiotic portrayal of The Twins, two 'ghetto' robots who can't read, speak in jive, act like punks, and generally are such an idiotic stereotype that it makes you wonder what Michael Bay was thinking, and how they could even make it into the final version of the film. They add nothing but the lowest of low-brow humor all while being racial stereotypes of the worst variety. I mean come on, a gold toothed robot? Seriously?The plot line is a mad dash from one end of the film to the other, with very little room for any real character development to take place. Much screen time is given to massive robot battles in which it is sometimes pretty hard to tell which Transformer is which, and who is in fact winning. The MORE phenomenon really sinks the ship here because I found myself losing interest in what was happening simply because it was too hard to keep track of who was an Autobot and who was a Decepticon.A film overpopulated with robots, unnecessary characters, and crammed full of as many explosions as possible, the movie left me feeling tired and frustrated. It's likely there will be a third Transformer installment in the future, and if Michael Bay directs, it boggles the mind trying to think of ways he could up the ante on action and poorly designed story. Perhaps he'll opt for 90 minutes of robots blowing the hell out of everyone and everything and skip the story entirely. If he does that, it might actually be better than this piece of garbage.1.5/5 Stars.",2,More! More! More!

1164213,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0019M5C0Q,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 6]","There has been an awful lot of criticisms heaped upon Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, the sequel to Michael Bay's surprisingly good 2007 film.  Some of which are justifiable (twin Autobots Mudflap and Skids being caricatures of racial stereotypes for one, and the fact that there isn't much of a story to be found here), but in the end, Revenge of the Fallen is just as its predecessor was: big, dumb, and loud fun.  The story picks up two years after the conclusion of the last film, with the heroic Optimus Prime (once again voiced by the great Peter Cullen) and his Autobots allied with the military and taking out renegade Decepticons across the globe.  In the meantime, Sam (Shia LaBeouf) is embarking on going away to college, much to the chagrin of his obscenely hot girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox).  Things don't go too well for Sam however, as it turns out he holds the key to the Decepticons plans for universal domination, as Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) is revived, and his ancient, evil master The Fallen (voiced by Tony Todd) unleashes a wave of destruction upon the planet.  Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Kevin Dunn, Julie White, and the great John Turturro are back as well; even though most of them take a back seat to the display of giant robots smashing and destroying everything in sight.  Despite the many inherent flaws of Bay's filmmaking, he does manage to coax enough comedic moments out of the proceedings, and there is great interplay between LaBeouf and Fox, plus (of course) enough brilliant special effects to keep you glued to the screen.  The only real major drawbacks of the film is that at a solid two and a half hours, it does wear out its welcome, and the film as a whole just isn't as awe inspiring as its predecessor, as the audience is now used to seeing these giant robots in disguise transform and cause mass destruction.  If you enjoyed the first Transformers film, you'll probably enjoy Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, just based on the fact that, as previously mentioned, it is big, dumb, and loud fun that proves to be enjoyable; even when there is so much happening on the screen that you may get lost in the haze.

1164214,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B0019M5C0Q,Newton Ooi,"[1, 3]","2009 was full of anticipated movies, with Transformers 2 being the most hyped about.  Opening during the summer with both regular and an extended-length IMAX versions, this movie quickly made back its $200 million budget and more.  But like many sequels, this was a big letdown from the first movie, as both critics and fans took jabs at the various parts of it.  Here is my take on why the movie sucked.First, the comedy was a rehash of that found in the first movie, except closer to the gutter.  Transformers 2 features humping dogs, a humping decepticon, and dialogue around sex among both couples, Sam and Mikaela, and Sam's parents.  Nobody really wants to see old people talk about sex, especially if they remind them of their parents.  The stereotypical parents are worse than before; the wife, Julie is ditzy, with her ditziness juiced up by some pot brownies.  The husband, Ron, is still a knucklehead; cheap, conniving, and loud-mouthed.  Besides the sexually-oriented comedy, we also have the racial jokes and stereotypes.  This time, instead of having Anthony Anderson playing a geeky homeboy, we have two autobots who talk, and act like gangsters from the hood.  Everything from their slang, use of profanity, to their notions about reading, seem geared towards attracting the East LA crowds of hoodlums and bro's into buying tickets.  And last but not least, John Torturro is back as Simmons, sarcastic, bombastic and pretentious.  Having watched this movie twice, once at the theater and now once on DVD, I finally realize that the entire comedy routine of both the 1st and 2nd Transformers movies is built on dichotomies.  Basically, half the character are dead-serious all the time, and the other half are ridiculous all the time.  There is no-one in between, no person who acts serious when needed, and then cracks an occasional joke at the right moments.  Every character fits and is defined by a specific stereotype.Second, the action scenes were totally unrealistic.  We see about a dozen autobots and several dozen decepticons in this movie.  All the decepticons are killed in battle except for Megatron and Starscream.  All the autobots live, except for Optimus, who is killed but brought back to life.  How is this possible, especially when many of the decepticons looked bigger and meaner than most of the autobots?  This was basically a robot version of Rambo or James Bond; the vastly outnumbered good guys never miss and never die of, while the bigger, meaner, bad guys all get killed of, with a couple of exceptions to make sure there is a sequel.  Its as if Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg took a storyline from one of the 80's action flicks, and replaced half the human characters with robots.  Utter lack of originality.Third, the storyline is chock full of holes.  The most visible example is at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  When Jetfire stands up and opens the door to go outside, we are suddenly in the middle of a desert airfield.  How do we go from Washinton D.C. to a desert?  Another example is when the decepticons go live on worldwide TV and threaten to destroy the world's cities if mankind does not give them Sam Witwicky.  We then see decepticons standing atop various towers throughout the world's cities.  And then nothing.  Its as if all the decepticons left.  Why not destroy a couple of cities to make good on their threat.  For an action movie about a war on earth, there seems to be minimal collateral damage of any sort!Probably the worst part of this movie is the dialogue.  All the transformers speak english almost the entire movie.  Even Soundwave, when giving orders from space, speaks in english.  Why would an alien race go out of their way to speak english.  The first Transformers movie was very realistic in that the decepticons always spoke their own language except when conversing with humans.  Why the letdown here?  Did Bay and Spielberg spend so much money on the explosions and other visual effects that they had to cut money on screenwriting some transformer dialogue in?  And then when the robots do speak, they have accents.  Why does Jetfire have an australian accent?  He lives in D.C., so if anything, he should have an East Coast or Virginian accent.  Its as if the movie makers decided that since australian actress Maggie Madsen was not in this movie, they could make up for her absence by having one of the transformers speak with an australian accent.And my biggest beef with the movie is the brazen copying of the POTC movies.  In the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, we have Barbossa die and then come back to life, then we have Jack Sparrow die and then come back to life.  Here in Transformers 1 and 2, we have Megatron die and come back to life, followed by Optimus Prime who dies and comes back to life.  Can we have some other plot device please?!All in all, this is probably one of the worst movies of 2009.  The only redeeming value is the package the DVDs came in, a case that opens up to become Bumblebee.",1,"Buy it for the cool casing, not for the movie",1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,5009,"['2009',

Explosion sound effects are even bigger than before, and the transformers have unique sounds to their weapons; which is a mix between bullet fire and electronic based weapon firing.Graphics are just as amazing as the first movie was, but you also have gigantic transformers in this movie. Even if you have the larger than life transformers, you still feel like they fit in and don't seem like they are CGI at all. A few scenes have the entire area with CG only, and it's done so well I didn't even realize it until they tell you about them in the special features. The explosions are still just as great as the first, with even larger explosions in this movie.The military actions are just like the first movie, and you can really tell they are coordinated professionally, with a ton of real life AC130's and Blackhawks to just name a few. It's really cool to see real life military tactics, with them doing their own thing and supporting the Autobots.I personally don't think that the controversy surrounding the movie is true at all. You have these two brother Autobots that are accused of making fun of black people. I personally don't believe this because white people try and talk gangster out there, and you can't tell me that they could also be hillbillies instead of being black. Even in a race of super advanced robots you will have the lemons in the group, and I don't think its offensive to anyone, just humorous events.Also this movie does have crude humor, and I really think it's funny. Some people have complained that this is a family movie and that they didn't expect to hear some of the humor when they brought their children to it. Ok, this movie is rated PG-13 and it clearly says crude humor on it, and I believe that is the parents responsibility if they think their child is ready for that or not, this is why it doesn't factor into my score.The special features are great; I mean it's around three hours total of special features. They talk about the history of the transformers franchise, and so much more. It's pretty cool hearing about how they made the amazing robots in the film. Also on top of all the special features in the second disk, you have a full audio commentary with Michael Bay and the writers.Overall I say you should buy this movie. This is how you should do a sequel: They took what made the first movie great, and made it even better.~Written: August, 2010Positives:* Even better story than the first* Bigger and even more kick-ass robots* Same great soundtrack with some changes* Awesome Special effectsNegatives:* Nothing, just like the first",5,Micheal Bay does another great job,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,3183,"['follow', 'up', 'great', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '2007', 'story', 'ton', 'more', 'robots', 'action', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'still', 'amazing', 'CG', 'first', 'film', 'bigger', 'more', 'detailed', 'robots', 'were', 'made', 'IMAX', 'movie', 'what', 'first', 'one', 'did', 'great', 'ton', 'more', 'second', 'film.You', 'have', 'great', 'sound', 'track', 'movie', 'add', 'creepier', 'Decepticon', 'music', 'film', 'great', 'main', 'theme', 'still', 'playing', 'movie', 'even', 'bring', 'rain', 'theme', 'back', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Explosion', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'even', 'bigger', 'before', 'transformers', 'have', 'unique', 'sounds', 'weapons', 'mix', 'bullet', 'fire', 'electronic', 'based', 'firing.Graphics', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'amazing', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'have', 'gigantic', 'transformers', 'movie', 'Even', 'have', 'larger', 'life', 'transformers', 'still', 'feel', 'fit', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'are', 'CGI', 'A', 'few', 'scenes', 'have', 'entire', 'area', 'CG', 'only', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'tell', 'special', 'features', 'explosions', 'are', 'still', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'first', 'even', 'larger', 'explosions', 'movie.The', 'military', 'actions', 'are', 'just', 'first', 'movie', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'are', 'coordinated', 'professionally', 'ton', 'real', 'life', 'AC130', 'Blackhawks', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'really', 'cool', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'military', 'tactics', 'doing', 'own', 'thing', 'supporting', 'Autobots.I', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'true', 'have', 'two', 'brother', 'Autobots', 'are', 'accused', 'making', 'fun', 'black', 'people', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'white', 'people', 'try', 'talk', 'gangster', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'hillbillies', 'instead', 'being', 'black', 'Even', 'race', 'super', 'advanced', 'robots', 'will', 'have', 'lemons', 'group', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'offensive', 'anyone', 'just', 'humorous', 'events.Also', 'movie', 'have', 'crude', 'humor', 'really', 'think', 'funny', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'family', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'hear', 'humor', 'when', 'brought', 'children', 'Ok', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'clearly', 'crude', 'humor', 'believe', 'parents', 'responsibility', 'think', 'child', 'ready', 'not', 'why', ""n't"", 'factor', 'score.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'mean', 'three', 'hours', 'total', 'special', 'features', 'talk', 'history', 'transformers', 'franchise', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'pretty', 'cool', 'hearing', 'how', 'made', 'amazing', 'robots', 'film', 'Also', 'top', 'special', 'features', 'second', 'disk', 'have', 'full', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'writers.Overall', 'say', 'should', 'buy', 'movie', 'how', 'should', 'do', 'sequel', 'took', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'movie', 'great', 'made', 'even', 'August', '2010Positives', '*', 'Even', 'better', 'story', 'first*', 'Bigger', 'even', 'more', 'kick-ass', 'robots*', 'Same', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'changes*', 'Awesome', 'Special', '*', 'Nothing', 'just', 'first']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

1164224,A2SA6LR78V49UV,B0019M5C0Q,"OrangeCrush ""Still shooting with Film!""","[3, 6]","First and foremost I really enjoyed the first transformers. Even tho that film was also flawed it still wound up being an excellent summer popcorn action flick. Unfortunately I cannot say the same thing for the sequel. The biggest problem I have with this film is its running time. Michael Bay just doesn't seem to understand that out of all of the films that end up running over 2 hours, VERY FEW are summer action films. Thats because it takes a great story with exceptional performances to keep people interested that long and I am sorry to say Transformers is not one of those films. There is absolutely NO reason why this film couldn't have been made in under 2 hours. In fact if you were to get rid of a lot of the scenes that don't need to be there and shorten a few of the battle scenes, this film could easily have come in around the 1 hour 40 minute mark.This shortening of the film would have had a positive ripple effect throughout the entire film as your not only making the film a better length, your also getting rid of a lot of the scenes that hurt the quality of this film. Some of the scenes that immediately come to mind are the one involving the parents. I actually enjoyed the role they played in the first film but they were just annoying in the sequel. For example, the entire eating of the pot brownies scene on campus. It does absolutely NOTHING to further the plot and was obnoxious. Again I enjoyed them in the first film but they were nothing short of annoying in this film.Another problem with this film is it had some action scenes that went on WAY to long. For example at the end of the film when Shia LaBeouf is trying to get to Optimus with the dust. I swear it took him at least 30 minutes to get there. That entire sequence just dragged on and on and on. Yes it had some very cool action scenes in it and they could have kept all of them and still shortened it DRAMATICALLY. This problem of having too long of a running time is not a new problem for Michael Bay. Almost every film this guy makes is too long. I am not sure what the problem is, if he is just a terrible editor or he has such an ego that he doesn't want to leave anything on the cutting room floor. Whatever the reason this is hands down one of his biggest problems as a director. The bottom line, these kinds of action films should never run above an 1:40. It just kills the pacing of the film and ultimately hurts the overall quality of the film and this film is a perfect example of just that.On a positive note we were given some fantastic action scenes that weren't just a mess of close ups like we had in the first film.. This time we get some wide angle shots that clearly show the action taking place in the shots. In particular the fight in the forest that ultimately saw Optimus taken down was amazing. I also think the story as whole was fairly interesting. I liked the entire back story of how the Decepticons had been here before and how they left behind the ancients that were looking for the key. I really didn't have a problem with anything regarding the overall story and this is why I ultimately gave this a 3 star rating. I think this film had a lot potential, it was unfortunately just squandered by Bay.Now I perfectly understand the argument that most fans are throwing out there. This is a summer popcorn film. We shouldn't expect Oscar worthy performances or Oscar worthy writing. Well in all honesty I wasn't and my biggest problems with this film arent even connected to those aspects of the film. Again my biggest problems deal with length, pacing, and leaving in scenes that should have been cut not only due to length but also due to quality. Because of these problems this wound up being an average action film and that really is a shame as it could have been so much more. At this point the studio should give Michael Bay an ultimatum, Bring the next film in under 1:50 or we are getting a new director. Again I don't know what it is about Bay that makes him incapable of making films under 2 hours and to be honest I really don't care anymore. This series still has a lot of potential and as long as Bay continues to make these into epic length films, that potential will never be realized.I will admit that I think a lot of people are being a bit harsh in regards to scoring this film as there is no way this film deserves a 1 star rating. I honestly believe that most of the people that have given it a 1 star rating did so not because they actually think it deserves a 1 star rating, they did it because they are upset with Bay for blowing this film and the best way to show that is by giving it a 1 star rating. While I don't agree with such methods, I can at least understand the frustration. This could have been a much better film. All he had to do was cut the film differently, bring down the running time to 1:40 or 1:50 and I honestly believe it could have been a much better film. As is its just a mediocre film that goes on way too long.3 Stars (I would probably have given it a 2.5 if Amazon allowed scoring in .5 increments)",3,Extremely Flawed!,1256515200,"10 26,

I don't know whats up with all the haters and critics who hate this movie. Oh well, all that matters is that I enjoyed it, and many Transformers fans will enjoy it as well. After seeing the new Transformers movie I can say the critics are wrong, this movie was awesome! The entire original cast is back which plays a huge part of this movies success. The movie takes off where the last one left off. Starscream (now the leader of the Decepticons) decides to return to earth from Cybertron to revive the Decepticon leader Megatron. After the Autobots discover Megatron has been revived and is now seeking revenge, Optimus Prime tries to get Sam to help them stop Megatron once and for all. This new movie is even more action packed than the first, and if you're a fan of Transformers you will most likely love this new movie. This is now one of the best looking blu-rays to date. The Walmart edition is similar to the IMAX Dark Knight edition, with a few fight scenes that fill up your entire TV, but other than that there's not much difference. There is no doubt that this will be the one of if not the biggest selling blu-ray to date. With the new PS3 slim and top notch release like this, I believe this is the movie to finally take blu-ray to the mainstream.As an added bonus, the Blu-ray will include an exclusive interactive feature that gives viewers the ability to customize their own robot characters and get a glimpse at a rogue robot. Out of all the available permutations, one will unlock an exclusive interview with Michael Bay about his plans for the next adventure.Two-Disc Special Edition DVD & Blu-ray:The TRANSFORMERS: Revenge of the Fallen specs belowThe Blu-ray is presented in 1080p high definition with English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital with English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese subtitles.

To me it seemed like they were mostly concentrating on the ""human"" aspect of the movie instead of the actual transformers themselves. I would have loved to see optimus fight a little more or maybe for the last fight scene to be a little longer. I could have done without all that Sam and his girlfriend, college problems. Way too much skin was exposed and this is not something for little kids. Which makes no sense seeing that they are the ones asking for the transformer toys.

1164240,A3PWPNZVMNX3PA,B0019M5C0Q,rareoopdvds,"[12, 19]","I am surprised at how many people really love this movie and feel its a great movie. Some claiming the greatest action film, while others astounded at the special effects, some saying its incredibly emotional and impacting. For me, I felt continually hammered over the head until my senses were numb to everything going on in the film.The story, however dense or plotless you may feel it is, was mishandled and confusing. The action sequences were lengthy and generally a mish-mash of shiny metal parts. I could not tell who was fighting and for the most part, did not care. I know teenagers will love this movie and could tolerate the high-intensity-over-stimulation scenes can bring and be able to know what is going on, but from someone who is older, I found them overwhelming to the point where the action was undecipherable.The robots were more biological this time around which took away from the 'Transformers' understanding that they were cars, or at least machines, and could transform into some known image, like a humanoid or beast like machine. But when I saw the ""Other Hot Chick"" in the movie, and she was a robot, it became a new breed of transforming and so to me it was out of the realm of what I knew Transformers to be.The film is directed by Michael Bay who seems to put so much into one scene and have these grand panoramic sweeping shots that it engulfs the plot and through-action, that I gave up trying to sort out any meaning to the film. It looks like a cyclone of machine parts moving across the screen.The star, Shiah Labeouf, reprises his neurotic annoying character who has no other meaningful lines besides ""No-no-no-no-no...."" Megan Fox looks like she is in a Playboy shoot in every scene. John Turturro is the best part of the film.If I could comment on the special effects, while they are incredible, what is more incredible is that the special effects artists were able to tell themselves what characters were transforming into what, and also who was fighting who.Lastly, there were so many scenes that did not need to exist, such as the mom who ate some pot brownies and got high at Sam's school. Its not comic relief, it does nothing for the plot. The film is already 2 and half hours, why do we need this scene? Megan Fox could have been cut entirely and it would not have changed one scene in the film. Sam going to college was not necessary either. Dwight Schrute, err, I mean, Rainn Wilson, had a small and unimportant role.In the beginning of the film it was cutely set up to hear Sam have difficulty saying 'I love you' to the hottest chick in the room (Megan Fox). Later in the film, Sam is knocked out for the count and goes to Transformers heaven for a brief moment, and in that time Megan says (with all of her best emotional effort) 'I love you'. That seemed to save Sam and he came back to life at that moment. True love does indeed conquer all.In sum, I thought this was a terrible film, virtually in every respect. It had occurred to me, while watching this film, that lots of action and great special effects do not equal and exciting film. In fact, my senses were so dulled from over stimulation that I found them boring. Michael Bay had stated he was not going to do Transformers 3 and vowed not to do high budget films in favor of and independent film to prove his directorial prowess. However, temptation of the big bucks could not sway his passion for directing when he agreed to do a third part. I cant imagine what a mess that will be. I admit, I rented this movie on the pretense that it was going to be a bad film. And it was.

1164247,AEOCAW963TM88,B0019M5C0Q,"R. Goldberg ""Bobbo""","[0, 3]","Forgive this departure. There are enough trenchant opinions of the film that mine will ring hollow. Briefly, I enjoyed this silly, overproduced, over the edge and at times over the limits film. I liked it in much the same way I enjoyed that Matthew Broderick version of ""Godzilla"" - there was nothing that stood in the way of just letting the thing be what it was. I found the first one, thin story notwithstanding, to be most enjoyable, and the effects shots to be some of the most beautiful I'd ever seen. I stared at a 37"" screen in a Sam's Club, having had no intention of seeing ""Transformers,"" with tears in my eyes at the lyrical beauty and depth of the visual effects. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" was a lesser film in that respect: the editing was so frenetic at times that one didn't have a chance to really study the beauty of the shots (I guess that's what slo-mo is for). But it was a good-natured film, and John Turturro's burlesque turn was worth the price of admission, especially if you knew his Pacino-esque interp in the first film. Suffice it to say I found it a fun romp with plenty of room for popcorn.What I can't understand is this subculture of reviewers who seemingly take near-ecstatic joy in tearing a film to shreds. I see it all the time with Shyamalan films, which I invariably enjoy for their metaphoric content and soft poetry. Roger Ebert called the effects in ""The Last Airbender"" ""atrocious."" What an outrageous statement; they were groundbreaking and gorgeous. An article in Computer Graphics World magazine was mindblowing in describing how things were done, but before that I found the work with the elements to be beautiful, convincing, properly stylized, operatic, and visually uplifting. Yet all Night Shyamalan has to do is make a movie and people are lined up around the block to parade their critical faculties and prowess of the pen, lambasting it within an inch of its life.We're all entitled to our opinions, of course, and a forum of this type exists to provide the opportunity to share them. But when I see the near Industrial Revolution energy brought to the task of excoriating what is, after all, merely a fun, popcorn movie, I am bemused to say the least. It's a Michael Bay! If you don't know by now what that means, do more research! :) It's like the people who called the hideous ""Doctor"" Laura Schlessinger in a time of great emotional need, expecting therapy, and getting skinned alive. For a time, I felt sorry for them, but that passed. They knew who and what she was before they called, after all. If you intend to see (much less buy) ""Revenge of the Fallen,"" make sure you like wildly overdone action, can briefly eschew subtle characterization, and don't mind just having a good time - even if that good time is laughing your fanny off at a film that you don't relate to.

1164254,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0019M5C0Q,Robert Badgley,"[13, 19]","Transformers Two is one of the worst sequels in recent memory and remains as one of the worst pictures I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through.Spielberg,Bay and company should be ashamed of this overly complicated,long and generally shoddy product they hoisted on an eagerly awaiting public.The first movie in this franchise was superb;the right amount of action with a very credible plot and great special effects.This movie takes all that that was built on and essentially trashes it.Shia Lebeouf returns as Sam,as his friend Optimus Prime continues his fight to eliminate the Decpeticon threat throughout the world(and in space).Sam discovers a piece of the Allspark in his house which melts through the floor to bring to life all the appliances in his house,wreaking alot of unwanted havoc.Optimus approaches Sam saying that the Decepticons are amassing again and the time has come that he needs his help.Sam,incredulously considering all that has past in the first movie,refuses to help!!He's off to college and can't be bothered??? Sam,in keeping with all that has gone on,should have been right there,no questions.This illogical plot thread creates a rift from which the movie never recovers.Sam goes to college but the inevitable conflict follows him,much to his chagrin(what did he really expect?).In fact he does everything to avoid getting involved.His roommates we discover even run an internet alien conspiracy theory site;how convenient!The fight eventually engulfs Sam and his girlfriend who have no choice but to join Optimus and company in their fight against the Decepticons.Their journey goes worldwide and Megatron is(of course) released and in turn releases the Fallen,the evil head of the Decepticons.In the end it is a dual to the death and just as we think Optimus and Sam are no more a material called the Matrix comes into the picture and with the help of ancient Primes Sam is sent back to bring Optimus back to life to finally defeat the evil horde.This is just a tip of the iceberg breakdown of the plot,because it is a long,ponderous and over complicated thing that I could never do justice to anyway;nor is it WORTH repeating or trying to do justice to(may I recommend a look at [...],to see just how complicated it really is).One autobot we are intro'd to is a souped up ice cream truck which turns into two ""homeys"" at will who constantly argue over nothing and are there for supposed ""comic relief"" but offer nothing but annoyance.At 143 minutes this special effects driven leviathan slowly weaves its' way along and doesn't really get moving until the last 20 minutes or so,and by then everything is anti-climactic and you are just wishing the whole mess a speedy and quick ending.This two DVD set contains featurettes,deleted and alternate scenes and a music video by Linkin Park.The film has been transferred beautifully and the sound as A-1.However it is like trying to dress up a corpse;there is no life here so why bother.This movie goes on my all time Turkey list for two reasons:what the film IS and for what it SHOULD have been.Unless the next one can dig itself out from under this massive failure somehow,this might have essentially killed the franchise in just two pictures.The producers lost sight of the ball big time and the proof is painfully here for all to see.But I recommend you save your money and DON'T!",1,One of the worst and painful sequels in recent

I'll focus then on the Bluray edition and its contents as there are already plenty of reviews discussing the quality of the film.Disc one includes the movie with an audio commentary by director Michael Bay and the writers. The movie looks and sounds incredible in its Bluray edition, the level of detail (1080p) on the scenery, the characters, the robots (while transforming for example) and the sounds during the battles make perfect reference material for HD home theater display, a 5.1 DTS-HD master audio track is included, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital are also presented. There is however, an exclusive edition which includes the IMAX scenes in shifting aspect ratio, this is not the version Amazon is selling in case that's the version you are after.Disc two is loaded with plenty of extra material in full HD:* The Human Factor (Exacting Revenge of the Fallen) - Includes documentaries covering the whole process from Development and design to post-production and release of the film, you can watch them separately or as a whole.* A Day with Bay: Tokyo - If you followed the release of the film in theaters you may remember the world premiere took place in Tokyo; this documentary includes all the details on the premiere, from Bay's impressions on 'Terminator Salvation', to the press conferences and the like. While in HD most of the time there are some night shots that do not look that well.* 25 Years of Transformers - This is a documentary on the history of the Transformers franchise.* Deleted/Alternate Scenes - Only three are included and they are actually extended scenes that you can easily tell why they were removed (""Sam and Alice meet"", ""Witwickys in Paris""  and ""Leo refuses to go to Egypt"")* Linkin Park's ""New Divide"" Music Video*The Matrix of Marketing - Includes trailers, TV spots and image galleries of posters and merchandise.While I prefer the first movie over this one, 'Revenge of the fallen"" does not disappoint in its Bluray edition.

I bought the Blu-Ray edition from Amazon @ $[...] (now down to $[...] as of this review).If you liked the first Transformers movie, you'll HATE this one.More action? Yea.But the movie SUCKED. I had read the reviews before I bought it, but, I know my opinion isn't necessarily the same as anyone else.Please don't take just my word for it. Read the other reviews.This movie developed the relationship of Sam and Mikaela, which was to be expected. But they even screwed that up.Ironhide, a major character in the first movie, BARELY made it on to the screen for this movie.And they had some very immature/lame jokes. Such as..1) The little robot who was humping Mikaela's leg.2) Same little robot would 'fart' every so often, as indicated by the 'flame' coming from his behind.3) Devastator (Constructicons combine to make one big robot) had a scrotum.4) Agent Simmons claiming ""This is top secret. Do not tell my mother.""5) There was this new character. Sam's college roommate. More than once talked about how he got his testicles hurt. Yea, I know it hurts, but did not add anything to movie.And those are just the jokes that I can think of off the top of my head.

It's obviously running around in her garage and no one notices?  The Autobots' rendition of slum kids with the Black ghetto accents will probably offend some viewers.Besides the dropped ""coming of age"" storyline with the ridiculous antics of Sam's roommate and screaming girlfriend who just wants to have her first online date, we have a decent bit of history of the Optimus Prime's group, who deal with the red-tape of government - run by a lackey who gets his quite nicely I might add.Action:  The movie forgets about a decent script and plot for some Rockem Sockem action with lots of alien robot fights.  Yes, lots of explosions - well, it is a Michael Bay film after all.Bottom Line:  Outside of learning about the invasion of these `Bots and how they've been around us since the dawn of Time, and some incredibly impossible athletic actions by Sam, who almost dies in the attempt upon the deserts of Egypt, it's really not much of a film.

1164268,AIBRTGBN07D6A,B0019M5C0Q,Scott,"[0, 1]","I wasn't expecting much going into this film. I'm aware of director Michael Bay's history and his habit of making mindless popcorn films with huge explosions, scantily-clad women, and awful cheesy dialogue. Sometimes that's okay for me. However, I thought the first film was okay for what it was, so figured maybe I would like the sequel. I was wrong. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is the most ridiculous campy, poorly-written and poorly-directed film to come out this year. The acting by Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox is average, and the special effects are extremely well done. That's about the only saving grace for this film.The writing is so unbelievable you almost have to see it to believe it. At one point a character actually utters the line ""not on my watch."" No one in the history of the military has ever said this outside of a film. Reading over the screenplay, you would think it was some terrible Transformers fan faction written by a tenth grader and posted to the Internet. The dialogue is horrible. This would be a great movie if it was targeted to 9 year olds, but the overt sexual references and language suggest an older demographic. Maybe it's because Bay is trying to please a wide range of people, and maybe that's why we have jokes made about Transformer Testicles and there's a scene where a transformer (with a Jersey accent much less) tries to hump Megan Fox's leg. What possible reason is this robot trying to hump her leg? Is that the way they procreate? There is ZERO excuse for it other than a cheap laugh. And that's ALL the jokes are, cheap laughs. I honestly would not have been surprised to see a transformer fart in this film, or maybe a scene where a transformer gets high. It wouldn't matter if it made sense because an intoxicated transformer would be HILARIOUS. But don't worry, because there's plenty of scenes of Sam's mother accidentally getting high at college and proceeding to follow the Robin Williams/Jim Carey acting formula of physical humor. Then there are Skids and Mudflap - two Autobots who can't read, speak in ""jive,"" act like gangster-wannabes, and fight a lot. One of them even has a gold tooth (I am not making that up). I am one of the last people you will meet who cares about things being politically correct or will ever claim anything is racist unless it is blatant, but this was a BLATANT stereotype. I cannot believe this made it into the movie. I wouldn't call it racist, but if these characters had actually been human, the NAACP would have freaked out.This movie is also insanely long, at a running time of 2.5 hours. This probably could have been avoided if there wasn't so much slow motion footage of people running. I was miserable after the first 45 minutes. Bay should have cut at a minimum, the last half hour off of the movie. The action scenes, while good, were way too confusing. The robots are so complex you can't tell what is happening since it's so fast and you can't figure outTransformers: ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is not Armageddon. It is not Bad Boys. It is definitely not the Rock. Say what you will about those films, they at least had somewhat decent plots and required some brain activity. This movie is nothing but pure mindless action, awful jokes, and gratuitous shots of Megan Fox (and only one of those is a good thing).",1,Very disappointing,1246233600,"06 29, 2009",2009,3306,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'going', 'film', ""'m"", 'aware', 'director', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'history', 'habit', 'making', 'mindless', 'popcorn', 'films', 'huge', 'explosions', 'scantily-clad', 'women', 'awful', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'okay', 'However', 'thought', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'okay', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'figured', 'maybe', 'would', 'like', 'sequel', 'was', 'wrong', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'campy', 'poorly-written', 'poorly-directed', 'film', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'acting', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'average', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'film.The', 'writing', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'almost', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'one', 'point', 'character', 'actually', 'line', 'not', 'watch', 'one', 'history', 'military', 'ever', 'said', 'outside', 'film', 'Reading', 'screenplay', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'terrible', 'Transformers', 'fan', 'faction', 'written', 'tenth', 'grader', 'posted', 'Internet', 'dialogue', 'horrible', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'targeted', '9', 'year', 'olds', 'overt', 'sexual', 'references', 'language', 'suggest', 'older', 'demographic', 'Bay', 'trying', 'please', 'wide', 'range', 'people', 'maybe', 'why', 'have', 'jokes', 'made', 'Transformer', 'Testicles', 'scene', 'where', 'transformer', 'Jersey', 'accent', 'much', 'less', 'hump', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'leg', 'What', 'possible', 'reason', 'robot', 'trying', 'hump', 'leg', 'way', 'procreate', 'ZERO', 'excuse', 'other', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'jokes', 'are', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'honestly', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'see', 'transformer', 'fart', 'film', 'maybe', 'scene', 'where', 'transformer', 'high', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'made', 'sense', 'intoxicated', 'transformer', 'would', 'be', 'HILARIOUS', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'Sam', 'mother', 'accidentally', 'getting', 'high', 'college', 'proceeding', 'follow', 'Robin', 'Williams/Jim', 'Carey', 'acting', 'formula', 'physical', 'humor', 'Then', 'are', 'Skids', 'Mudflap', 'two', 'Autobots', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'speak', 'jive', 'act', 'gangster-wannabes', 'fight', 'lot', 'One', 'even', 'gold', 'tooth', 'am', 'not', 'making', 'up', 'am', 'one', 'last', 'people', 'will', 'meet', 'who', 'things', 'being', 'politically', 'correct', 'will', 'ever', 'claim', 'anything', 'racist', 'blatant', 'was', 'BLATANT', 'stereotype', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'made', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'racist', 'characters', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'human', 'NAACP', 'would', 'have', 'freaked', 'out.This', 'movie', 'also', 'insanely', 'long', 'running', 'time', '2.5', 'hours', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'slow', 'motion', 'footage', 'people', 'running', 'was', 'miserable', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'Bay', 'should', 'have', 'cut', 'minimum', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'action', 'scenes', 'good', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'confusing', 'robots', 'are', 'so', 'complex', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'happening', 'so', 'fast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'outTransformers', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'not', 'Armageddon', 'not', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'definitely', 'not', 'Rock', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'films', 'least', 'had', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'plots', 'required', 'brain', 'activity', 'movie', 'nothing', 'pure', 'mindless', 'action', 'awful', 'jokes', 'gratuitous', 'shots', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'only', 'one', 'good', 'thing']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

He pronounced it much better than the firstTransformers movie, and I have to agree with him, as I sat through that one, and gave up on it after about thirty minutes.From the first minutes, you get high-tech military ops, explosions, cool flying debris, massive and gratifying Hollywood movie explosion fireballs, chases, and CGI action so fast and so intricate and that you've got to put the DVD player on slo-mo to actually see all the work that the F/X geeks put into the scenes.  Never mind the ridiculous opening premise of the Chinese government allowing a full-blown American (there are a couple of Brit allies, in the thinnest sliver of a nod to multilateralism) military combat op to take place on their soil.This film is a nonstop raging orgy of military hardware, reeeeeally close to but not quite a two-hour commercial for theUS Air Force, with a little bit of Army and Marines thrown in to, you know, actually close with the enemy and hold the objective.  It sure looks to me like the Navy didn't want to play in the film, as there's an extended scene of an aircraft carrier being blasted apart by the bad AGRs, sailors and all of their really cool hardware--wait for it--yes--exploding and going down.  Like we got inIron Man, there are a lot of USAF air-power goodies, with the C-17 and F-22 featuring prominently and early, F-16s, A-10s, the Predator, then the B1 bomber.  We even get the classic SR-71, but sadly not flying.  The only thing we didn't get was the 117 or the B2, or a Global Hawk.  The Army and Marines throw in some BFVs, Abrams and MLRS, and of course there are tons of Blackhawk helicopters.  And everything shoots stuff, stuff that blows up!All of that gear, and then some, is thrown at the bad AGRs, and they throw more than their share back, in very active and deadly combat.  But, we never, ever, see anybody dead or dying, other than the robots.  There is no blood, no reality of the literally tens of thousands who get killed over the course of this film.  While not as egregious as the glossing over the hundreds of millions killed in that awfulThe Day After Tomorrow, or the billions who are sure to die in the upcoming ""2012"" disaster-fest, it's something like irresponsible to just waste thousands of folks in crystal-clear CGI while being so thoroughly removed from the true, horrific nature of it.And because it's a Michael Bay film, you've got lots of slo-mo American flags fluttering in pure rippling jingoistic splendor.  This is awesomely crafted pandering for the never-been-past-the-state-line audience at home, but I can't help but see it as just another reason for the other 5.7 billion people on the planet to think we're arrogant jerks.I enjoyed the character of National Security Advisor Galloway as a pure and unapologetic lambasting of SecDef Rumsfeld, right down to the iconic specs.  He gets his, eventually, of course.  The only screwy part of this, is when he charges in to take over, he's got a warrant from the President, who is named once as President Obama.  This indirectly makes Obama look like a fool for appointing him, while it's the moron Bush Republican administration that apparently is the target.I love to watch John Turturro, although sitting throughYou Don't Mess With the Zohanreally was pretty difficult.  His reprised role as Agent Simmons allows him to be spastic, crazy, and get all weird, a great character and a perfect fit for the film.Camaro-bot comes across as sad, a developmentally challenged autobot.  He's a good guy, sure, but he's more like a V-8 golden retriever.Flick and Flack, or Zap and Zop, whatever the hell the two twin robots are called were hard to see as anything but annoying, contributing almost nothing to the story but idiotic wisecracks during the slow parts.  Why, yes, their characters and dialog were offensive, despite what the producers have said.  You'd think sophisticated entertainment professionals would have been smart enough to realize that this kind of portrayal isn't quite the thing to do anymore.  The movie could do without these two.And the illustrious Miss Megan Fox: Sorry, but all I could see of this Ultra-Hottie Of The Moment was a deep spray-on tan and many layers of industrial-grade lipstick.  Early in the film she comes across as nothing but trashy, and later she's nothing but makeup, with delicate smudges to make it appear she's actually been doing something.  She's pretty, sure, but not the greatest thing sinceJill St. JohnorRaquel Welch.Of course, dead isn't really dead.  Just like the first film, folks die but they don't really die.  It's just, y'know, an illusion, so easily rectified with a magic liquid/crystal/gem,  mystical knowledge, extraterrestrial power, that kind of too-easily crafted and lame gimmick.Bottom Line: Hey, this is a US blockbuster, so it's all lowest common denominator.  You can't expect depth of character, logical story, normal people, normal situations, or subtlety of story or expression.  But, buddy, You CAN expect massive CGI-rendered physical destruction, action, gunplay, chases, and tons of weapons, gadgets and technology, a hot chick or two, MTV-style editing and a soundtrack that will rattle your fillings, and this film delivers a surplus of all.",3,Explosion Weapon Robot Hardware America F/X Explosion Movie!,1257292800,"11 4, 2009",2009,5800,"['First', 'do', 'Internet',

1164280,AJ6XR403WY88M,B0019M5C0Q,"Sniff Code ""www.sniffcode.com""","[1, 5]","I can't believe I'm about to write this, but the Transformers sequel isn't as bad as the critics say. It really isn't. Especially if you are a person who never really got into the original animation series. Such a person might be dazzled by the sheer spectacle of 3D cars and planes turning into massive robots. A person unburdened by the history of the Transformers brand would probably care less that virtually all of the characters are so radically redesigned, both in appearance and personality, that they bear little to no semblance to the source materal. That won't matter to them.But it matters to me. As a kid I was loyal to the original series. I knew all the charcters. I knew their strengths and weaknesses. Their designs were simple and easy to recognize. Even their voices were so singular that I knew who was who without seeing them. But I am not the intended audience. Accepting that made it possible to appreciate some parts of the movie.Michael Bay did not set out to make a Transformers movie. He set out to make an action movie that merely uses the Transformers brand. With such an agenda, he's not obligated to evoke nostalgia by keeping the designs even remotely true to the source material. In fact, with the exception of Optimus Prime and Bumble Bee, the remaining autobots are so much new inventions that I can only wonder why Bay decided to stick with their original names. The Deceptions seemed more inspired by James Cameron's Aliens than by the original characters. They are also so generic in appearance and complicated in detail that they are pretty much anonymous. Especally in battle. When a deception is killed, it's difficult to know who just bit the big one. Nor do you care. Unlike, the original series, the Transformers as characters is less important than the Transformers as spectacle. They are show pieces. Eye candy. Enormous targets for shooting at and blowing upThe plot slightly echoes the original series. The Transformers need energy -- or energon as it is called -- to remain functional. The Decepticons know a way to get said energon, but it involves destroying the sun. Bad news for humans. From here you would think it's the Autobots who are going to stop them from this. But no. Again, Michael bay is not making a Transformers movie. Just an action movie. So it's really the humans -- that is, the United States military -- who are going to stop the Decepticons. Here is where Bay returns to his comfort zone. By diverting this back to a human driven action movie, he can revert to those cliches that make such movies what they are: Type-A male soldiers who are quick on thier feet, quick with their tongue and always in control. Schmucky government beuracrats with flawed rationalizations about what's really happening -- and who will get their just desserts served to them by the Type-A clever soldiers. You'll see more of this than you will actual big scary robots (it's not necessary to call them Transformers anymore).Oh, and then there's Sam Whitwicky (or however you spell his last name) and his girlfriend. And since this is an action movie, theirs is an action-movie romance. This means all of the eye gazing, and lip puckering is there, but without the sincerity of a real drama. Amazingly, this fast-forward love affair is where Bay devotes a lot of his attention. So I can't believe I'm about to say this: the real problem with Bay's Robot movie is that it takes far too long to get to the spectacle. Sure, he opens with one. But that's a given. All action movies open with action. It's part of the formula. But after the big bang opening, you have to wait about another hour before the second big clash between the robotsWhen it does come, though, boy what a ride. The big scary robots are fun to watch when they're slugging it out.",3,When the Robots Battle...it's a Fun Watch,1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,3796,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'write', 'Transformers', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'say', 'really', ""n't"", 'Especially', 'are', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'original', 'animation', 'series', 'person', 'might', 'be', 'dazzled', 'sheer', 'spectacle', '3D', 'cars', 'planes', 'turning', 'massive', 'robots', 'person', 'unburdened', 'history', 'Transformers', 'brand', 'would', 'probably', 'care', 'less', 'virtually', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'radically', 'redesigned', 'appearance', 'personality', 'bear', 'little', 'semblance', 'source', 'materal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'them.But', 'kid', 'was', 'loyal', 'original', 'series', 'knew', 'charcters', 'knew', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'designs', 'were', 'simple', 'easy', 'recognize', 'Even', 'voices', 'were', 'so', 'singular', 'knew', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'seeing', 'am', 'not', 'intended', 'audience', 'Accepting', 'made', 'possible', 'appreciate', 'parts', 'movie.Michael', 'Bay', 'did', 'not', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'action', 'movie', 'merely', 'Transformers', 'brand', 'such', 'agenda', 'not', 'obligated', 'evoke', 'nostalgia', 'keeping', 'designs', 'even', 'remotely', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'fact', 'exception', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'Bumble', 'Bee', 'remaining', 'autobots', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'new', 'inventions', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'why', 'Bay', 'decided', 'stick', 'original', 'names', 'Deceptions', 'seemed', 'more', 'inspired', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Aliens', 'original', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'so', 'generic', 'appearance', 'complicated', 'detail', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'anonymous', 'Especally', 'battle', 'When', 'deception', 'killed', 'difficult', 'know', 'who', 'just', 'bit', 'big', 'one', 'do', 'care', 'original', 'series', 'Transformers', 'characters', 'less', 'important', 'Transformers', 'spectacle', 'are', 'show', 'pieces', 'Eye', 'candy', 'Enormous', 'targets', 'shooting', 'blowing', 'upThe', 'plot', 'slightly', 'original', 'series', 'Transformers', 'need', 'energy', 'energon', 'called', 'remain', 'functional', 'Decepticons', 'know', 'way', 'get', 'said', 'energon', 'destroying', 'sun', 'Bad', 'news', 'humans', 'here', 'would', 'think', 'Autobots', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'stop', 'Again', 'Michael', 'bay', 'not', 'making', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'Just', 'action', 'movie', 'really', 'humans', 'United', 'States', 'military', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'stop', 'Decepticons', 'Here', 'where', 'Bay', 'comfort', 'zone', 'diverting', 'back', 'human', 'driven', 'action', 'movie', 'can', 'revert', 'cliches', 'make', 'such', 'movies', 'what', 'are', 'Type-A', 'male', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'quick', 'thier', 'feet', 'quick', 'tongue', 'always', 'control', 'Schmucky', 'government', 'beuracrats', 'flawed', 'rationalizations', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'just', 'desserts', 'served', 'Type-A', 'clever', 'soldiers', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'will', 'actual', 'big', 'scary', 'robots', 'not', 'necessary', 'call', 'Transformers', 'anymore', '.Oh', 'then', 'Sam', 'Whitwicky', 'however', 'spell', 'last', 'name', 'girlfriend', 'action', 'movie', 'action-movie', 'romance', 'eye', 'gazing', 'lip', 'puckering', 'there', 'sincerity', 'real', 'drama', 'Amazingly', 'fast-forward', 'love', 'affair', 'where', 'Bay', 'lot', 'attention', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'say', 'real', 'problem', 'Bay', 'Robot', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'spectacle', 'Sure', 'one', 'given', 'action', 'movies', 'open', 'action', 'part', 'formula', 'big', 'bang', 'opening', 'have', 'wait', 'hour', 'second', 'big', 'clash', 'robotsWhen', 'come', 'boy', 'what', 'ride', 'big', 'scary', 'robots', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'when', ""'re"", 'slugging', 'out']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
1164281,AIT3L2OSJNPZ6,B0019M5C0Q,"snoogins4life ""brokenone""","[7, 12]","Tis the season is usually a phrase you hear at the beginning of November to signify the beginning of ""The Holiday"" Season, but in the past few years another time of year has sprung up to take a bite out of the calender. It begins about the beginning of May and usually runs to the end of July or sometimes beginning of August, and it's called ""The Popcorn Movie"" Season; aka ""The Blockbuster Movie"" Season.  It's the time of year where you can escape the gaggle of giggly little brats that pass you in line and block the aisle in front of your favorite dvd section, texting one another; and grab a cold drink and a popcorn the size of your grandma's purse and sit in a theater with the thermostat set to 25 below and get comfortable, turn your brain off from all the thoughts of bills you need to pay, what's going on at your job, how are you gonna get your wedding ring unstuck from the drain your 3 year old threw it in; and just enjoy a film.  No need to over think, no need to criticize what's going on in the film, as long as it gives EXACTLY what is expected, no problems.Obviously, I am one of very few out there who understand this universal concept; and understand that Michael Bay is not an Oscar Winning Director, nor an Oscar Winning Screen Writer. If you went in to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen expecting anything other than big BAD robots and big GOOD robots beating the ever living snot out of one another, then you most likely went to see the wrong film.Let me just say a few words on most of the attacks being made on the film in general.  First, that there is no plot.  Um...it's Transformers, what plot...think of a paper thin reason to get the Decepticons and the Autobots fighting, a halfway decent reason to add a few choice humans and you have a plot, and by the way; said plot wasn't that bad.  We follow Sam Witwicky (Shai LeBeuf) to College, but before he goes he finds a shard of the Allspark (the big cube thing from the original) and it transfers important info into Sam's head.  He begins to have a meltdown in school, enter Mikeala (the ever HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT! Megan Fox!) to save his butt! and the rest falls into place much better than the original.  Where as in the first all roads were focused on ""what the crap is going on?"" in several different ways, all roads lead to ""KEEP SAM ALIVE!!!!""Now for the ""racism"" thing.  We live in the 21st century where three year olds know slang that would have made a sailor blush 30 years ago.  Many critics are attacking the addition of Autobot twins Mudflap and Skids saying they are racist stereotypes. I must have a VERY different definition of racism.  Slurs, comments directed at a person for their color, sex, sexual preference, age, etc. all are forms of racism.  Why is it that only the afformentioned Autobots are the only ones getting bashed, what about Jetfire? Stereotype of elderly?  The jock kids at the frat party...stereotype... Mikeala herself a stereotype. The Twins used no derogatory comments toward any race, sex or age group at all.  They are getting bashed for a look and a way of speech.  They and almost all the characters in the film are some form of stereotype.  So what's the big deal? how many films DON'T have stereotypes of somesort or another.  In fact the world as a whole is pretty much a stereotype.  Look at the media around you and tell me if there is much of anything that isn't.  Plus, you can't really call an asexual transforming machine a racist.  It's a dang machine!  I will admit though that there was some language from some of the Autobots; mainly Wheelie and the Twins; that aren't really for kids, but the film isn't PG, it's PG-13!!!Anyway, enough fussing.  The action sequences were AMAZING! The opening sequence in Shanghai between Optimus/Human soldier's and the new Decepticon Demolisher is UNBELIEVABLE!!! Also, the battle in the forest between Optimus and Megatron and Starscream was EYE POPPING WOW!!!  Needless to say, the effects were INSANE! As if the first films visuals weren't good, this one takes them one step farther.  The believability of the Transformers being in the film not added to the film was more so here than the first.  Plus, the action never really lets up.  From a funny action scene involving the Allspark shard at the Witwicky house at the beginning to the final battle between Optimus and The Fallen at the End, the War between the Transformers is epic in visual size.The humor was also bigger and more outlandish, to my strange delight.  From Mrs. Witwicky eating pot brownies and going ape s**t, to Wheelie going all ""dog friendly"" with Mikeala's leg. There is alot of humor, both kid friendly and not so much.  In fact, I think that there was alot more adult humor that kid humor.  There was more foul language for sure.The acting was also on par.  Shia is a fantastic actor and his comedic moments were the best part of the film.  Megan Fox, is an okay actress, but we don't go see her to watch her act, well we watch ""something"" act but not her per say.  John Tutorro is hilarious but not used nearly enough, and Josh Duhamal and Tyrese as soldiers Lennox and Epps do what they are there to do, fight with the Autobots.  But, to put it bluntly, this film really; unlike the first film; belongs to the Transformers, as it should, heck the film is entitled Transformers.There are also many new things to look for, we have familiar Transformers.  Optimus, Bumblebee, Ironhide and Ratchet return; but Arcee, and an old Transformer named Jetfire make their film debuts.  Also, Megatron returns from the dead, with Starscream by his side, we get to see an updated version of Soundwave now a really cool looking satellite dish and his little tiger like minion Ravage, plus of course the main bad Megatrons master The Fallen who is to my slight dismay underused for such a cool looking character.  Also, little nods to pretender Decepticons are thrown in, as well as Dinobots...well kinda, and a few other little surprises.Over all the film is a simple to understand, mindless, epic Popcorn Blockbuster Movie.  It's not Citizen Kane people and it's not Gumby either.  Over all, the new Autobots show different personalities whether we as a mass accept them as such or not, and I enjoyed the film as a whole VERY much.  In fact, I plan to go see it again in theaters and will most positively be getting it on Blu Ray when it hits.",4,Simply put...a fantastic...mind numbing action film!,1245888000,"06 25,

1164283,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B0019M5C0Q,S. Rhodes,"[8, 15]","There are times when movies can blow you away.  The first Transformers movie certainly blew me away.  Despite its problems, it was a fun ride with a well crafted story and even some well crafted dialog and sequence of events.  Transformers Revenge of the Fallen, however, shows us that bigger isn't always better.  In fact, bigger can be a headache.  Especially when it's a Michael Bay sequel.The film brings back Shia Lebouf and Megan Fox as our protagonists.  As it turns out, the Transformers actually came to earth a lot sooner than we thought.  In the year 17,000 BC to be exact.  A war happened involving some of the machines.  As it turns out, the Fallen were sealed... but they may soon rise again.  And Sam (played by Shia) has the key to this, which the Decepticons want to get a hold of.  And quickly.Anyway, Sam is off to college and as far as he is concerned, Bumblebee's job is done.  His parents are rather emotional over seeing him go (particularly his mother), but things could be worse, right?  Well, as it turns out, when he gets to college he meets a strange guy who has been tracking these ""aliens"" for some time, ever since the incident happened two years ago.  Apparently the Government is so good at covering things up they were able to make sure no one could remember all the chaos that happened right in the middle of the streets of the first film... in broad daylight.  Even stranger is that Sam still has a piece of the cube (All Spark) and despite holding onto it for two years, only now manages to touch it.  When he does, however, he begins to see a bunch of symbols in his head that he doesn't know anything about.These symbols, however, play  much bigger role than he could imagine.  The Fallen, it turns out, will rise again sometime.  And only one Autobot can stop them... Optimus Prime.  Unfortunately through circumstances it's a wonder if he can.  Even worse is how more decepticons are coming forth and finding most f the good guys.  Not to mention there's another man in the government hoping to mess things up because they believe that it's the fault of the Autobots that the Decepticons are coming in the first place.  And Michael Bay makes sure you really don't like this guy.Meanwhile, the Decepticons are after Sam because he knows something that's been implanted into his brain.  The end result is that the Autobots along with Sam and Mikeala--and a few supporting characters--have to stop the Fallen from rising again.On paper it sounds rather simple, but the movie is a lot more convoluted than it actually sounds.  It not so much that the plot makes little sense as it is that it keeps throwing one thing after another into the mix.  By the time the movie concludes you might find yourself having a little too much information.  But more than that, there's a lot of time spent away from the plot.  The first movie, for the most part, had very appropriate jokes that came at just the right moments.  Revenge of the Fallen throws several jokes at a wall hoping something will stick.  You'll get a good share of laughs, but also a lot of jokes that fall flat in the process.However, it's mostly Michael Bay's filming technique that makes the movie something of a drag.  In many instances the camera angles are incredibly weird and shaky.  When the robots are fighting it's really hard to get into the fight scenes because they're so chaotic and because the camera is constantly jerking around.  More often than not, you lose focus in the middle of the battle.  There are also tons of new robots introduced.  Good and bad.  Unfortunately the movie doesn't give us enough time to get to know any of them.  So much so that in some fights it was hard to tell the good guys from the bad.  Which brings up another thing, the fights themselves can be spectacular, but on the whole they're a little long.  Many moments in the movie are too overdone for their own good.The story in and of itself comes together but the way it comes together might leave some movie goers feeling cheated in some ways.  If anyone here has ever heard of the term ""Deus Ex Machina"" (which means ""God from the Machine"") then you should know that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is full of them.  In nearly impossible situations, amusing coincidences come into play.  Sam and friends need to get to Egypt upon JUST discovering they need to go there... they magically get there.  They find an old Transformer who is a Decepticon who just happens to have switched sides.  One of the most heart pounding moments of the entire movie is ruined by a Deus Ex Machina that looks as though Michael Bay and company decided to just tack it on.  There's plot and story but a lot of it comes off as an after thought.  Most of i just felt like things they tacked on to make sure that things come out just fine for our protagonists involved.  Every heart pounding moment is immediately crushed when you realize that no matter what happens, none of the characters are in any real danger because of many ""amusing coincidences.""  It makes the movie come as more predictable.That's not to say it isn't fun.  When you're not being given a headache by the camera work, the special effects are spectacular, and some of the fights are really good.  It's just that its hard to enjoy them because of the awkward camera movements and shifts.  Even Paul Greengras knew when we needed a break.That's not all, the movie is incredibly long.  Around two and half hours.  But it doesn't quite pass the butt-shifting contest.  A lot of scenes are long and drawn out.  The final battle in and of itself can make you feel like you're sitting through the incredibly long ending of Lord of the Rings.  It's not that it's long which can grate on the nerves so much as it is that Bay and his crew stuffed way too much in a movie.  Suffice to say, how long was this movie supposed to be before it was cut down?  There are so many characters and plot devices introduced that it's a wonder it could all e contained in one film.The acting, for the most part, isn't really all that bad, but there's far too much acting to care.  This is all about Shia.  Megan Fox is there, but she serves no real purpose other than to give the boys something to stare at between action sequences.One thing that might raise a few eyebrows however, may be ""The Twins.""  Where would Michael Bay be without ethnic stereotypes?  Here, the Twins are so stereotypical you wonder if Bay was trying to be offensive or funny.  I'm guessing it was the latter option of the two, but the crew on Transformers 2 did go a little overboard with it.Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is a visual spectacle but not much else beyond that.  To put it all in context, it's not hard to understand, but it's definitely cluttered.  And the director does nothing to make sure we care about the characters.  We don't learn much more about them than what the first movie gave us.  There's hardly any development.  It's pleasing to the eye, but little beyond that.",3,Headache Inducing...,1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,6994,"['are', 'times', 'when', 'movies', 'can', 'blow', 'away', 'first', 'Transformers', 'movie',

The second Transformers was good, but not as good as the original.  Not really surprising, as most of the time the original is the best.  But I still would recommend Revenge of the Fallen to lovers of the first.  All your favorite characters are back and some new ones.  The new characters are mainly autobots and decepticons, while they do add their touch, they don't change anything dramatically.  You also visit some new locations like Egypt, so that changes it up a bit.The plot is similar to the first.  The decepticons are trying to kill the humans and take over earth and the autobots are trying to stop them.  It is different enough to make it interesting but isn't anything amazing.  The action scenes are stepped up a notch.  This means more explosions, more fist fights, and more shooting missiles.  As mentioned before, there are more robots.  Sometimes there are so many that it's hard to keep track of who's who.  But it's not a big deal as you can figure it out pretty easily when you see who's fighting who.There's also the same type of humor as in the first Transformers.

Durrant ""tdurrant""","[1, 5]","First of all, though I am the right age to have seen the original Transformer cartoons, I never did watch them, so I don't come into the new franchise with any expectations of how it ""should be"".  I actually enjoyed the first movie, maybe because I didn't expect much, yet it entertained me and kept my attention.  I even bought that first movie on DVD and enjoyed watching it a couple of times.  The effects were impressive even if the plot did not represent the more intelligent side of science fiction.OK, now on to the sequel.  Wow.  I was watching it for free for the first time, more than a year after the theatrical release.  I put it off for so long because I had heard that it was not as ""good"" as the first.  That was an understatement.  I did not make it through the entire movie.  I just couldn't take it anymore.  I gave up once a little decepticon robot started humping the leading lady's leg while it admitted it never wanted to be a decepticon anyway.  How does that make sense anatomically?  Well, if you take everything that came before that point, I guess that scene fits right in.  I'd already been subjected to watching real dogs humping one another, and a horrible super-model type college girl trying to get busy with the leading man, just to find out she was really a robot with a robo-tongue.  And...um...speaking of which, that super-model robot lady can blow the crap out of various campus buildings, but can't beat one kid in a dorm room?  Anyway...all I'm saying is, it was not just one offense that caused me to pick up the remote and turn this piece of sci-fi crap off...it was an entire series of offenses.  There is one moment when the main character is about to have his head split open and brain removed because his mind holds robo-secrets.  I think that was symbolic of what was being done to viewers like me.Yep, my brain hurt while I was watching.  Even the stuff that would have at least registered on the ""cool"" scale in terms of special effects were so horribly edited (or programmed?) that I couldn't tell what was going on.  I get it...robots were fighting!  But I couldn't see anything-- just metal flashing around with different angles coming in so fast that I never got the entire picture.  The giant robot baddy that rolled through Tokyo in the beginning looked kinda like it might have been cool, but I never got a real look at the darn thing! Plus, I couldn't tell one decepticon from another-- I just know that the bad robots all had gruff, ""evil"" voices, as apposed to the good guys robots who talked...well...um...jive?  OK. It is hard to put into words.  And obviously it was just as hard for the makers of the movie to put this transformers concept into words, so they just threw as much CGI and over-the-top potty humor at the viewers as they could, hoping that the money would come flowing in, and it probably did, which is the biggest tragedy of all.",1,I think my brain fell out.,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,2907,"['First', 'am', 'right', 'age', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'Transformer', 'cartoons', 'never', 'did', 'watch', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'new', 'franchise', 'expectations', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'movie', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'entertained', 'kept', 'attention', 'even', 'bought', 'first', 'movie', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'couple', 'times', 'effects', 'were', 'impressive', 'even', 'plot', 'did', 'not', 'represent', 'more', 'intelligent', 'side', 'science', 'fiction.OK', 'now', 'sequel', 'Wow', 'was', 'watching', 'free', 'first', 'time', 'more', 'year', 'theatrical', 'release', 'put', 'off', 'so', 'long', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'first', 'was', 'understatement', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'anymore', 'gave', 'up', 'once', 'little', 'decepticon', 'robot', 'started', 'humping', 'leading', 'lady', 'leg', 'admitted', 'never', 'wanted', 'be', 'decepticon', 'anyway', 'How', 'make', 'sense', 'anatomically', 'Well', 'take', 'everything', 'came', 'point', 'guess', 'scene', 'fits', 'right', ""'d"", 'already', 'been', 'subjected', 'watching', 'real', 'dogs', 'humping', 'one', 'horrible', 'super-model', 'type', 'college', 'girl', 'trying', 'get', 'busy', 'leading', 'man', 'just', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'really', 'robot', 'robo-tongue', 'um', 'speaking', 'super-model', 'robot', 'lady', 'can', 'blow', 'crap', 'various', 'campus', 'buildings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'one', 'kid', 'dorm', 'room', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'saying', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'offense', 'caused', 'pick', 'up', 'remote', 'turn', 'piece', 'sci-fi', 'crap', 'was', 'entire', 'series', 'offenses', 'one', 'moment', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'have', 'head', 'split', 'open', 'brain', 'removed', 'mind', 'robo-secrets', 'think', 'was', 'symbolic', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'done', 'viewers', 'me.Yep', 'brain', 'hurt', 'was', 'watching', 'Even', 'stuff', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'registered', 'cool', 'scale', 'terms', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'so', 'horribly', 'edited', 'programmed', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'robots', 'were', 'fighting', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'just', 'metal', 'flashing', 'different', 'angles', 'coming', 'so', 'fast', 'never', 'got', 'entire', 'picture', 'giant', 'robot', 'baddy', 'rolled', 'Tokyo', 'beginning', 'looked', 'kinda', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'never', 'got', 'real', 'look', 'darn', 'thing', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'one', 'decepticon', 'just', 'know', 'bad', 'robots', 'had', 'gruff', 'evil', 'voices', 'apposed', 'good', 'guys', 'robots', 'who', 'talked', 'well', 'um', 'jive', 'OK', 'hard', 'put', 'words', 'obviously', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'makers', 'movie', 'put', 'transformers', 'concept', 'words', 'just', 'threw', 'as', 'much', 'CGI', 'over-the-top', 'potty', 'humor', 'viewers', 'could', 'hoping', 'money', 'would', 'come', 'flowing', 'probably', 'did', 'biggest', 'tragedy']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

1164300,A2LHMP07OFU6JW,B0019M5C0Q,Texas Reader,"[4, 17]","Here is my list as to why ""Revenge of the Fallen"" did not appeal to me:1)  You still have trouble telling the Transformers apart when they are fighting, especially the Decepticons.  That was the main complaint from people who watched the film the first time and Dreamworks did nothing, in this movie, to fix the problem.  You can never tell which Transformer got destroyed.  You can only guess.2)  There is not a single strong female character in the film.  The mother acts like a retard throughout the film.  Her role was to play a ditz.  Then you had the girl Transformer who is trying to get with Shia's character and you also have Meghan Fox's character.  I understand that both were there to appeal to a teenage audience, but at least try to give one woman some depth.  Fox's entire role was to show some cleavage and run in slow motion so people could see her breasts bounce.  Boing Boing Boing.  Also, there is not a single strong female character in the military.  In fact, I don't think the military, in the film,  has a single female in it at all.  It's a pure sausagefest.  What an insult to the women who serve in our military.3)  Of course, they didn't just insult women, they insulted African Americans too.  What's the point of having Transformers with gold teeth talking like a bunch of rappers? If the characters talked regularly, no one would have cared.  Why cause controversy over something stupid?  There are not enough Black people behind the scenes in Hollywood and, in instances such as this, it shows. I wonder what race they are going to insult in the third one.  They will probably have a Decepticon blowing up a building, while he wears a turban on his head.  I wouldn't be surprised.4)  Sometimes, when the Transformers speak, you have to listen carefully.  If you don't, you won't catch what they're saying.  In the final fight scene, this happens quite a bit.

I'm sure her off screen escapades will be the stuff of tabloid legend once faced with the reality of fading stardom.But let us not linger on the worm in the apple.The movie would've done better by cutting 30-40 minutes off the top.

By contrast, the last half or so shines beyond expectation with brilliant special effects and dessert battle scenes. Also consistently carried from the first Transformers is the wry humor- but we sorely miss Bernie Mac! John Turturro's reappearance was also a wonderful surprise.The writers and director would be wise to take geography lessons- the locations made no sense to those paying attention, but that's small stuff.So while you can't CGI talent (read, Megan Fox), you can CGI a fantastic effects driven adventure to hopefully eclipse the incidental talentless bimbo.",3,You can't CGI talent,1255996800,"10 20, 2009",2009,1345,"['odious', 'equally', 'talentless', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'stellar', 'contribution', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'slow', 'motion', 'running', 'tank', 'top', 'sporting', 'push-up', 'bra', 'rest', 'dim-wit', 'screen', 'presence', 'as', 'forgettable', 'lines', 'Representative', 'Hollywood', 'new', 'batch', 'moronic', 'young', 'things', 'Ms.', 'Fox', 'sure', 'not', 'disappoint', 'once', 'Transformers', 'trilogy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'off', 'screen', 'escapades', 'will', 'be', 'stuff', 'tabloid', 'legend', 'once', 'faced', 'reality', 'fading', 'stardom.But', 'let', 'not', 'linger', 'worm', 'apple.The', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'cutting', '30-40', 'minutes', 'top', 'set', 'up', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'leaving', 'college', 'scenes', 'thereof', 'did', 'nothing', 'move', 'plot', 'mother', 'escapades', 'border', 'more', 'obnoxious', 'funny', 'contrast', 'last', 'half', 'so', 'shines', 'expectation', 'brilliant', 'special', 'effects', 'dessert', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Also', 'consistently', 'carried', 'first', 'Transformers', 'wry', 'humor-', 'sorely', 'miss', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'John', 'Turturro', 'reappearance', 'was', 'also', 'wonderful', 'surprise.The', 'writers', 'director', 'would', 'be', 'wise', 'take', 'geography', 'lessons-', 'locations', 'made', 'sense', 'paying', 'attention', 'small', 'stuff.So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'CGI', 'talent', 'read', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'can', 'CGI', 'fantastic', 'effects', 'driven', 'adventure', 'hopefully', 'eclipse', 'incidental', 'talentless', 'bimbo']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

1164304,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B0019M5C0Q,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[6, 12]","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has a lot of flaws. Some are easier to overlook than others, especially with the nearly indescribable amount of mayhem exploding across the screen. While the CG effects have virtually perfected giant robots destroying everything in sight, the story department seems to have digressed into conjuring up outlandish situations that require even more preposterous solutions. Similar to the creation of Kryptonite to offset the invulnerability of Superman, several plot devices are devised as a way to counterbalance overly invincible Transformers, themselves created just to compete with the power of Autobot leader Optimus Prime. But of course, story isn't likely the primary reason to go see this film, and on an action scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a tank truck hitting a helicopter and 10 is an aircraft carrier colliding with a nuclear submarine, Revenge of the Fallen rates about an 11.Two years after the harrowing events of the first Decepticon attack on Earth, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) attempts to lead the normal life of a college student. But contending with overbearing parents, conspiracy-obsessed roommates, and a long distance relationship with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) gives way to fending off lethally aggressive girls, alien symbol-induced mental breakdowns, and once again saving the world from transforming robots intent on destroying the universe.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen certainly proves that bigger is not better. In its attempt to outdo the first film with louder sound effects, more destructive explosions, bulkier robots and grander comedy relief, it fails to square off against the appeal of its predecessor: originality. The transformations, the battles, the firepower, and the obnoxious amount of side characters are just too familiar; nothing about this sequel boasts an increase in creativity, just a boost in excess.This plays into the use of plot contrivances - those pesky solutions to the random problems that are pointlessly devised to keep the story complex and always changing. While most are so drastically unpredictable that knowing about them would ruin the surprise, the plot suffers from a lack of rules. Since the limits of almost everything surrounding the Transformers are never clearly defined, Revenge of the Fallen runs amok creating new origins, lore, abilities, characters and boundaries of mortality, with little rhyme, reason or concern. When a space bridge is introduced for brief teleportation, it's both unnecessary and completely unconvincing. And that's a problem in a movie about alien creatures that camouflage themselves as mechanical vehicles, which starts with little basis in reality in the first place.Almost the entire cast of the original returns, with even more new characters thrown into the mix; much of their involvement is for a few extra laughs that add nothing but running time. The witty banter between father, mother and son is almost too much to bear, the racial stereotype Transformers (Mudflap and Skids) are like Jar Jar Binks at best, and Megan Fox remains spotlessly clean no matter how many explosions she gets thrown from or the number of times she rolls around in the dirt. Design elements from The Matrix, Species, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and more make their way into this lengthy continuation, and despite the spectacular special effects and insanely monstrous new enemies, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen can't offer enough truly fresh material to warrant this overlong, mind-bogglingly destructive summer blockbuster.

1164305,A3OWUMRVHG0VGT,B0019M5C0Q,The Lou,"[10, 23]","Seeing this movie is equal to your parents forgetting about your birthday... a huge let down.  Don't get me wrong when director Michael Bay spends dump truck loads of money on a movie parts of it are going to be cool. Unfortunately these glimmers of hope were far and in-between. This movie brings to question why are most sequels pieces of trite (Die hard 2, Mission impossible 2, long long list). Why did this one have to be soo cheesy and at times ludicrous? Sigh... only thing for sure is Megan Fox critical comments on Bay focusing too much on Transformers special effects were true. Bay of course threw a George Lucas style fit over the comments ummm wonder why. Hit a nerve Bay.Story (Cheesy, confusing & a disservice to its roots): The story really ruined this Movie its Jar Jar binks bad at times. The first Transformers developed characters for both the humans and Transformers. This movie adds multiple new Autobots but only gives lines to a few. For example Skids and Mudflaps are the comic relief that get a lot of screen time. They unfortunately are batting about 1/20 funny to cringing stupid attempt at a lousy joke. These two get old fast. Now their is the Decepticons which at times are deviously fun. Unfortunately they throw in a plethora of new Decepticons but I couldn't recognize any of them. Most went unnamed and were given sticky note size character development. The Fallen wasn't even in the original series. Ultimately I could have cared less who wins Decepticon or Autobot and that's why Bay failed. Maybe next time they will review the classic cartoon and try and play off some of their story lines. Plus why did they add robot humans??? That was never part of the series. They melted movies like the Terminator, a national lampoons comedy, Indiana Jones and Transformers into one. The end result was yet another dreadful sequel.Acting (Average or stale): Comedy can be over done and over played. Sam's college roommate regurgitates the same slap stick the whole time. John Turturro along with the Witwiky parents had these over the top jokes that should of been toned down. Most of the Transformers were good minus Skids & Mudflaps. The jokes overall fell flat losing the spark of the first Transformers. Sigh. Why Mr. Bay did one of the little Transformers start humping Miss Fox's leg? Mr. Bay, allowing this over the top humor is totally your fault.Special effects (Top notch but not enough): Eye candy works best with a great story. Bad story in this flick means eye candy wasn't as much fun. That being said there is a lot of eye poping effects. It mostly amounted to more of the same. Like instead of two Transformers fighting there would be six. So no new ground was covered just a lot more of the old ground from the original Transformers. Despite my critical comments the special effects were the best part of this movie and most likely oscar nomination worthy.Best parts of Transformers Revenge effects were the forest battle, Decepticon space lair & Decepticons crashing into the sea.Final thought: My only resolve is that this movie bridges very little from the first Transformers. So I'll skip out on buying number two and hope the third gets it right again. Sad that yet again I'll end up owning another trilogy minus the middle section.Second take: This review isn't for most younger viewers. Teenagers will mostly like this flick. Also adults who have the emotional depth of a teenager will most likely enjoy this one.",2,Another feckless sequel,1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,3465,"['Seeing', 'movie', 'equal', 'parents', 'forgetting', 'birthday', 'huge', 'let', 'down', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'when', 'director', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'dump', 'truck', 'loads', 'money', 'movie', 'parts', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'cool', 'Unfortunately', 'glimmers', 'hope', 'were', 'far', 'in-between', 'movie', 'question', 'why', 'are', 'most', 'sequels', 'pieces', 'trite', 'Die', 'hard', '2', 'Mission', 'impossible', '2', 'long', 'long', 'list', 'Why', 'did', 'one', 'have', 'be', 'soo', 'cheesy', 'times', 'ludicrous', 'Sigh', 'only', 'thing', 'sure', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'critical', 'comments', 'Bay', 'focusing', 'too', 'much', 'Transformers', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'true', 'Bay', 'course', 'threw', 'George', 'Lucas', 'style', 'fit', 'comments', 'ummm', 'wonder', 'why', 'Hit', 'nerve', 'Bay.Story', 'Cheesy', 'confusing', 'disservice', 'roots', 'story', 'really', 'ruined', 'Movie', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'bad', 'times', 'first', 'Transformers', 'developed', 'characters', 'humans', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'multiple', 'new', 'Autobots', 'only', 'lines', 'few', 'example', 'Skids', 'Mudflaps', 'are', 'comic', 'relief', 'get', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'batting', '1/20', 'funny', 'cringing', 'stupid', 'attempt', 'lousy', 'joke', 'two', 'get', 'old', 'fast', 'Now', 'Decepticons', 'times', 'are', 'deviously', 'fun', 'Unfortunately', 'throw', 'plethora', 'new', 'Decepticons', 'could', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Most', 'went', 'unnamed', 'were', 'given', 'sticky', 'note', 'size', 'character', 'development', 'Fallen', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'original', 'series', 'Ultimately', 'could', 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'who', 'Decepticon', 'Autobot', 'why', 'Bay', 'failed', 'Maybe', 'next', 'time', 'will', 'review', 'classic', 'cartoon', 'try', 'play', 'off', 'story', 'lines', 'why', 'did', 'add', 'robot', 'humans', 'was', 'never', 'part', 'series', 'melted', 'movies', 'Terminator', 'national', 'lampoons', 'comedy', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Transformers', 'one', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'yet', 'dreadful', 'sequel.Acting', 'Average', 'stale', 'Comedy', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'played', 'Sam', 'college', 'roommate', 'same', 'slap', 'stick', 'whole', 'time', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Witwiky', 'parents', 'had', 'top', 'jokes', 'should', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'Most', 'Transformers', 'were', 'good', 'minus', 'Skids', 'Mudflaps', 'jokes', 'overall', 'fell', 'flat', 'losing', 'spark', 'first', 'Transformers', 'Sigh', 'Why', 'Mr.', 'Bay', 'did', 'one', 'little', 'Transformers', 'start', 'humping', 'Miss', 'Fox', 'leg', 'Mr.', 'Bay', 'allowing', 'top', 'humor', 'totally', 'fault.Special', 'effects', 'Top', 'notch', 'not', 'enough', 'Eye', 'candy', 'best', 'great', 'story', 'Bad', 'story', 'flick', 'eye', 'candy', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'being', 'said', 'lot', 'eye', 'poping', 'effects', 'mostly', 'amounted', 'more', 'same', 'instead', 'two', 'Transformers', 'fighting', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'six', 'So', 'no', 'new', 'ground', 'was', 'covered', 'just', 'lot', 'more', 'old', 'ground', 'original', 'Transformers', 'critical', 'comments', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'most', 'likely', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'worthy.Best', 'parts', 'Transformers', 'Revenge', 'effects', 'were', 'forest', 'battle', 'Decepticon', 'space', 'lair', 'Decepticons', 'crashing', 'sea.Final', 'thought', 'only', 'resolve', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'first', 'Transformers', 'So', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'out', 'buying', 'number', 'two', 'hope', 'third', 'right', 'again', 'Sad', 'yet', 'again', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'owning', 'trilogy', 'middle', 'section.Second', 'take', 'review', ""n't"", 'most', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Teenagers', 'will', 'mostly', 'flick', 'Also', 'adults', 'who', 'have', 'emotional', 'depth', 'teenager', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'one']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

1164308,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0019M5C0Q,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[27, 44]","Michael Bay, what went wrong?""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" suffers from sequelitis big time. It almost seems as though Bay decided that whatever worked in the first ""Transformers"" film had to be bigger, louder, more frantic, more hectic and less human in this new sequel. And more of it. A lot more.The first ""Transformers"" was a surprising film. Infused with a significant amount of character and story, the film used newfound star Shia LaBeouf and made him the center of the film. Because he was so good, the loud, frantic whirling special effects seemed better somehow. They made sense. And the relationship between LaBeouf's character and Megan Fox's character seemed sweet somehow, something we can all relate to. Bay layered in the usual special effects, allowing him to play with his toy box, but they actually contributed to the story and were cool to watch.All of this helped the first ""Transformers"" become a huge hit. When a sequel became inevitable, Bay apparently decided to just add more and more and more to the new film. Bigger is better, right?But all of these additional elements only serve to make the new film everything the first film wasn't. Loud, obnoxious, confusing, repetitious and filled with two-dimensional characters.Picking up a few months after the first film ended, Sam (LaBeouf) is headed to college and his parents (Julie White and Kevin Dunn) are ready for a trip to Europe. Sam is distraught at the prospect of leaving Mikaela (Megan Fox) behind and they have an argument about who will say ""I Love You"" first. Before he leaves for school, he spots a piece of the All Spark, the object the Transformers were fighting over in the first film, causing him to see symbols everywhere. The All Spark fragment also wakes up some Transformers who soon start to attack Mikaela before she quickly subdues them. When Sam arrives at school, the symbols continue to distract him. Before you can say ""Optimus Prime"", we learn that a new leader of the Decepticons (or old depending on how you look at it) the Fallen has come back and taken control. He leads the Decepticons in an all out battle to find Sam and Mikaela and learn what he knows. They think the symbols will lead them to an ancient resting place for their ancestors, an ancient resting place hiding a power that will allow them to take over the Earth. Naturally, Optimus Prime, Bumble Bee and the other Transformers have something to say about that. The US Government has set up a special ops unit led by Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) to work with Optimus Prime and his team to hunt down Decepticons hiding across the globe. As we watch a lengthy prologue, it becomes apparent they have been around for a long time. After a destructive chase through Shanghai, a US Senator manages to convince the President to let him take over the unit. And all he wants to do is shut them down. So Lennox and Epps have to work to keep him at arms length. Eventually, as Sam and Mikaela try to figure out what the symbols mean and how to avoid the Decepticons, they run across an old friend (John Turturro) who now works in a deli. Soon, everyone is headed to Egypt.Does this synopsis sound as confusing to you as it does to me? And I've seen the film. This is a big part of the problem with ""Fallen"". There is too much going on and little of it makes sense.There is a lengthy prologue showing the Fallen leading a group of Decepticons to Earth and battling with cavemen. This is kind of a neat idea and helps to set up the rest of the film. I guess Bay was bored by this sequence, as it is ostensibly just narrative, because this is immediately followed by a lengthy action sequence set in Shanghai. Lennox, Epps, Optimus Prime and the other Transformers are hunting a Decepticon. When they find the bad Transformer, all hell breaks loose and they chase the renegade through the busy, crowded streets. During the chase, many buildings and a freeway are destroyed. This sequence is fun to watch, but later, you begin to wonder what role it plays in the overall film. It doesn't seem to have a lot of connection, except to introduce us to new Transformers, and to reintroduce us to the robots we have already met. More on this later. The sequence, while fun to watch, ultimately just seems like a waste of time. And when a film like this runs two hours and thirty minutes, time isn't something you want to waste. More on that later.Perhaps the worst thing about ""Fallen"" is the waste of the actors. No one shows any emotion and everyone seems to be simply walking through the story. We have seen this from Bay before, he has never been very interested in character development or story, preferring to make things blow up, but after the first ""Transformers"" film, I held out some hope that he would continue to learn and continue to improve his storytelling technique. At one point, Mikaela cries and Bay lingers his camera on her face to capture the teardrop, almost as though he is trying to prove he can capture emotion.I'm not entirely sure ""Fallen"" is appropriate for young children. The first time we see Mikaela (Fox) she is literally draped across the top of a motorcycle, her butt barely covered in denim short shorts, her blousy shirt revealing a tight t-shirt inside. The composition almost seems like a parody of a Maxim cover. Apparently, she now works at a motorcycle shop detailing the top of the chassis. This apparently requires her to get real close, forcing her to lay on top of the motorcycle, the big engine between her bent legs. Later, after Sam arrives at college, another beautiful young lady, Alice (Isabel Lucas), starts to throw herself at Sam. As soon as this storyline began to play out, I could just see the filmmakers looking at her audition tape. ""She is HOT"". Later, when a twist occurs, the story makes some lewd references and she makes some strange gestures. Not exactly appropriate for little kids.I defy just about anyone to remember what most of the Transformer's names are. Beyond the few central characters (Optimus Prime, Bumble Bee, Megatron), there are simply too many of them and they don't look or act differently enough to make it easy to recognize them. Given the level of cacophony, it is near impossible to hear them address each other. So this limits the number of characters we can follow to about half the number on screen. Of those, again another half are distinct enough to make us care about them. What is the point of adding so many characters when it is all but impossible to follow them, to make any sense of them?Of the new additions, two seem particularly problematic. During the Shanghai sequence, we see a beaten up ice cream truck participating in the action. When the truck breaks apart into two transformers (I think), they begin talking in a highly characterized 'jive' talk. Later, these robots get an upgrade and transform into two different 'Scion' like cars. I have heard these characters referred to as Bay's Jar Jar Binks. It is a pretty good analogy. They are insulting characters and only serve to bring the quality of the rest of the film down.Later in the film, they meet an old British Decepticon (I'm not kidding) who served in World War II as a bomber but has now switched sides. They find him in the Smithsonian and... oh, well, do you really want to read about story points that make little or no sense?With the two beginning sequences and an extremely long sequence set in Egypt to close the film, ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" seems long. As soon as the Egypt plotline began, and we begin to watch LaBeouf and Fox running through the desert sand, my companion turned to me and said ""Doesn't this seem familiar?"" An accurate assessment as much of the beginning of the first film concerns Lennox and Epps fighting the Decepticons in another desert. Repetition is not a good thing in film and only serves to make this film seem longer.Worse yet, Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) is nowhere to be found which leads Bay and his writers to come up with a new villain. They look back, you might say way back, and come up with the Fallen. He resembles a cross between a transformer and Alien. This is a little ironic as Bay recently feuded with director McG over ""Terminator Salvation"", claiming some of his new Terminators resembled Transformers. Michael, It appears that he is not the only director to receive inspiration from others.""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" is the second most disappointing film of the summer. ""Terminator Salvation"" is the first.",2,Revenge of Michael Bay,1247875200,"07 18, 2009",2009,8557,"['Michael', 'Bay', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Transformers', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'suffers',

In the cartoon it had the power to cure the entire universe of the hate plague yet in the movie can't even heal optimus all the way. Also how rampage is in two places at once? He is fighting bumblebee and yet is supposed to be the left leg of devastator (who is tearing down a pyramid at the same time as rampage is fighting bumblebee)um...yea....how does that work? The movie also explains prime's ancestors, the 7 primes. No place in any episode of any saga explains who came before optimus prime. That and it shows who came before megatron, although the true megatron bowed down to no-one with the exception of unicron, but whole other movie.My friend told me that the first movie barely dodged a rated r rating, which after seeing this movie I believe this one barely dodged the r rating not the first.The only shocker I got was the fact that people were bringing their little kids to this movie.

1164312,AA78TCLHXPJOK,B0019M5C0Q,Timothy G. Berntsen,"[2, 5]","If my headliner sounds like I don't like the movie, that's not the case. I came out of the movie super pumped and eager to buy lots of small plastic robots that will probably end up in a cardboard box in the attic in a few months, because there was plenty of fun stuff in the movie. However, overall there were a lot of questionable storytelling choices in this movie, and I think that this is a prime example of what kinds of effects the writers' strike had. The plot of this movie is very unfocused, constantly jumping from one location to another, but it feels more like a really long car ride than it does a rollercoaster. There's lots of scenes in this movie that simply aren't necessary. This movie should have been about 30 minutes shorter, and most of it could have been taken out of the stupid college campus scenes, the bathroom / sex humor, Skids and Mudflap's zany antics, and several rather useless and unnecessary plot devices.There is a good movie hidden somewhere in Transformers 2, underneath the layers and layers of unnecessary trash. As it is it's a fun movie, but it goes on way longer than it should and has a lot of humor content that is downright inappropriate for the kids that the movie is largely meant for. It's not terrible, but it's not nearly as good as the first one.

I think he over acted and he really slowed down the film.  One way to describe this film is too much sizzle not enough steak.  There are explosions and fighting robots.  The two most cringeworthy scenes include a robot humping the heroine's leg like a dog and robot genitalia.  Michael Bay needs to make a movie with story and not just special effects.

Rather than try to achieve plot, characterization, and drama (such as was found in Ironman, and Dark Knight), Michael Bay goes for the simpler approach.  Like Indiana Jones and the Starwars before it, Transformers 2 throws out all the building blocks of a good film and replaces it with horrible (and offensive) dialog, ethnic stereotypes, and mindblowing action.What's bad? Quick list: Transformer's ""testicles"", farting decepticons, dogs fornicating, ghetto-talking transformers with gold teeth & dreadlocks, multiple unneeded upskirt camera angles, John Tuturro in a thong, HORRIBLE ending, too much human army time, storyline itself has innumerable plotholes, etc.What's good? Megatron/Starscream interactions, the few robot-robot fight scenes, Prime ripping off heads.Overall this film is mediocre at best.

1164315,A3SLPJHXZYTT8A,B0019M5C0Q,Ton Thai,"[1, 3]","Decepticon forces return to Earth on a mission to take Sam Witwicky prisoner, after the young hero learns the truth about the ancient origins of the Transformers. Joining the mission to protect humankind is Optimus Prime, who forms an alliance with international armies for a second epic battle.So there it was. The trailer. Played on the silver screen. It looked darker than the previous film. The tagline ""Revenge is coming"" reinforces that aspect. It excited me. This could really be a serious, dark movie, like THE DARK KNIGHT. I was wrong. So wrong. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. I was insane hoping for a serious, dark, gritty action flick from Michael Bay. In fact, the trailer doesn't show any of the crude and sexual humor throughout the film. And you know what? I found the jokes pretty funny. Sure, some of the jokes are just disgusting (you'd be surprised what lays hidden in this movie), but I liked the laid back feel.The plot was...confusing, I will admit, but in a film like this, does it really matter? The movie never ceases to be entertaining. The action sequences are amazing, but directed by Michael Bay, it's not surprising. If there is one thing I have to say about him, he knows how to entertain audiences. And he was right when he said there would be more action scenes in the film. You thought the first movie had a lot of action scenes? Oh, God, I wouldn't even begin. To keep it simple, the special effects are nothing short of being flawless. I loved the score by Steve Jablonsky, most of it being brought back from the first movie.In an interview with Megan Fox, the sexy actress said the following: ""This movie is not about acting."" And she's right. I can go on saying that the humans in the films were actually the robots, but that's not particularly true. You have to give credit to Shia LaBeouf's part, at least. He does a swell job, given the material. I found John Turturro to be quite annoying in the first film but the producers or writers decided it was a good idea to bring him back. I still found him annoying in the film and I especially rolled my eyes when he was doing a serious scene.This goes along with Sam's parents in the film, Kevin Dunn and Julie White, although I don't find them quite as annoying. In fact, I enjoyed most of their scenes. They give some good comic relief throughout the film. I just didn't like them being serious because you just can't take them seriously. The writers apparently thought Ramon Rodriguez's character was a good idea. I just really hated him. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson also returned for the sequel, although they don't have much to do. Overall, the whole cast pretty much had one thing to do: Run in slow motion.With all the positives, there was no doubt some negatives. The most obvious is the overly long running time. I don't think Michael Bay ever made a movie less than two hours. I would've liked the movie if it were thirty minutes shorter. It was until the third act that I realized how long the movie was going to be. It started to meander a bit after that and there came a point in the film that there was just overkill. The movie was just really long. Another thing that annoyed me was a pair of twin Transformers. Actually, add another Transformer. All three of them were yelling profanity throughout. Not my thing.If you walk into the movie with the right mindset, you'd be surprised that you had enjoyed most of the film. The action sequences are just fantastic but the plot is lacking. The actors don't have much to do but to run around and scream. But really, what are you going to expect when you walk into a Michael Bay film? A plot? Great performances? A delightful script? Nah. You'd expect action. Action. And did I mention action?",3,Revenge is coming.,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,3753,"['Decepticon', 'forces', 'return', 'Earth', 'mission', 'take', 'Sam', 'Witwicky', 'prisoner', 'young', 'hero', 'truth', 'ancient', 'origins', 'Transformers', 'Joining', 'mission', 'protect', 'humankind', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'who', 'alliance', 'international', 'armies', 'second', 'epic', 'battle.So', 'was', 'trailer', 'Played', 'silver', 'screen', 'looked', 'darker', 'previous', 'film', 'tagline', 'Revenge', 'coming', 'reinforces', 'aspect', 'excited', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'serious', 'dark', 'movie', 'THE', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'was', 'wrong', 'So', 'wrong', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'was', 'insane', 'hoping', 'serious', 'dark', 'gritty', 'action', 'flick', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'fact', 'trailer', ""n't"", 'show', 'crude', 'sexual', 'humor', 'film', 'know', 'what', 'found', 'jokes', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Sure', 'jokes', 'are', 'just', 'disgusting', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'what', 'hidden', 'movie', 'liked', 'laid', 'back', 'feel.The', 'plot', 'was', 'confusing', 'will', 'admit', 'film', 'really', 'matter', 'movie', 'never', 'be', 'entertaining', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'amazing', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'not', 'surprising', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'how', 'entertain', 'audiences', 'was', 'right', 'when', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'thought', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'action', 'scenes', 'Oh', 'God', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'keep', 'simple', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'being', 'flawless', 'loved', 'score', 'Steve', 'Jablonsky', 'most', 'being', 'brought', 'back', 'first', 'movie.In', 'interview', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'sexy', 'actress', 'said', 'following', 'movie', 'not', 'acting', 'right', 'can', 'go', 'saying', 'humans', 'films', 'were', 'actually', 'robots', 'not', 'particularly', 'true', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'part', 'least', 'swell', 'job', 'given', 'material', 'found', 'John', 'Turturro', 'be', 'quite', 'annoying', 'first', 'film', 'producers', 'writers', 'decided', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'bring', 'back', 'still', 'found', 'annoying', 'film', 'especially', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'when', 'was', 'doing', 'serious', 'scene.This', 'Sam', 'parents', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'Julie', 'White', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'quite', 'annoying', 'fact', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'scenes', 'give', 'good', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'serious', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'writers', 'apparently', 'thought', 'Ramon', 'Rodriguez', 'character', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'just', 'really', 'hated', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'also', 'returned', 'sequel', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'Overall', 'whole', 'cast', 'pretty', 'much', 'had', 'one', 'thing', 'do', 'Run', 'slow', 'motion.With', 'positives', 'was', 'doubt', 'negatives', 'most', 'obvious', 'overly', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'ever', 'made', 'movie', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'movie', 'were', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'was', 'third', 'act', 'realized', 'how', 'long', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'started', 'meander', 'bit', 'came', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'overkill', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'long', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'was', 'pair', 'twin', 'Transformers', 'Actually', 'add', 'Transformer', 'three', 'were', 'yelling', 'profanity', 'Not', 'thing.If', 'walk', 'movie', 'right', 'mindset', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'film', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'just', 'fantastic', 'plot', 'lacking', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'run', 'around', 'scream', 'really', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'expect', 'when', 'walk', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'film', 'plot', 'Great', 'performances', 'delightful', 'script', 'Nah', ""'d"", 'expect', 'action', 'Action', 'did', 'mention', 'action']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

1164318,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B0019M5C0Q,trashcanman,"[11, 17]","Bay, I want my goddamn brain cells back!  Every once in a while a movie comes along that reminds me why we have terms like OMFG.  This is one of those movies.  Like Devastator, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is big and looks totally awesome.  But also like Devastator in this film, pretty much all it does is SUCK!  If you could sue an artist for making the world you live in a stupider place, Michael Bay would be so snowed under by lawsuits that he would never be able to work again.  Millions of slack-jawed yokels would cry at the thought, but then they'd see something shiny and forget all about it.  Cinema would be like a utopian wonderland of intelligent creative films that deliver both thrills and wit in equal portions and Hollywood would burn to the ground as actual artists got a chance to succeed and not be plowed under by the juggernaut of hacks with massive budgets who only know how to throw cliches and massive special effects at the audience and hope they're too busy staring at the hot lead actress's jiggling hotness as she runs from explosions in a low-cut top to care that they are essentially being told that they are imbeciles by the same people who are taking their money.  Wouldn't that be nice?Okay, Bayformers 2: Revenge of the Terrible Writers.  I need some positivity after that rant.  Let's talk about the good.  Bay apparently took the criticisms of the first film to heart.  I foundTransformersto be as hugely entertaining as it was moronic and actually enjoyed a lot of the jokes, as juvenile as they were.  It succeeded on a crowd-pleasing scale and I had a very good time watching it.  But the action scenes were a bloody mess.  Just random images of rolling, leaping, and tumbling robots that looked absolutely wonderful but you had no idea what the hell they were doing because the direction was so unbelievably inept.  ""Revenge of the Fallen"" fixes this complaint admirably.  The action scenes are epic and you can actually see what's going on with a lot of wide-angle shots and solid editing.  No complaints with the action itself at all, really.  The overall direction was pretty good as far as the fun stuff goes and it was killer to see Rampage.  Bumblebee and Bestimus Mucho (or is it Optimus Prime?) were also very cool.  There, I said something nice.  Now brace yourself.  The bad news is coming hard and fast.Holy sonofawhattheHELL were those writers thinking?!  I simply cannot believe that there is a single person on this planet that would read that script and say ""yeah, that's definitely not the stupidest thing ever"".  If there is, then we deserve to be obliterated by a race of evil robots.  ""Mean robots suck!""  That's what they came up with for the Autobots to yell at the Decepticons?  Seriously?  And what do they tell the humans, you ask?  How about ""Why don't you get a haircut with your b!+ch a*#!"".  Seriously.  That's what they came up with.  I want to line up every person from the guy who wrote that line to the director, producers, and everyone else right down to the voice actor who didn't say ""no effing way am I going to say that retarded sh!+"" and kick them each squaw in the nuts.  And while I'm on topic, yes Mudflap and Skids are as bad as advertised.  Worse even.  Any claim that they aren't racist caricatures is pretty much squashed as when one admits in his transvestite Chris Tucker impersonation ""Ummm...we don't read much"" .  Get it?!  Because robots who behave like black people are supposed to are stupid and ignorant!  Like black people!  HAHAHAHA!  That is so funny and clever!  Do I mind racist humor?  No, I seek it out.  But it needs to be A) funny,  B) satirical or ironic, C) aimed at adults who can understand B, and preferably D) all of the above.  And this is without a doubt a kid's movie.  A movie that damn near earns an R-Rating with near-constant profanity, I might add.  Because it's 100% necessary to have a robot based on an 80's childrens cartoon designed to sell toys curse out ""punka*# Decepticons"".  Ooh, edgy. And nothing could be more hilarious then watching dogs have sex.  Multiple times.  And then having a pint-sized robot hump the lead actress's leg in a similar manner.  So funny. Maybe they'll do a live-action ""Clifford: The Big Red Dog"" film and have him rape Emily Elizabeth and call her a whore before rocking a giant canine Cleveland Steamer on her.  That'd be totally boss, dude!  High five!Alrighty then, so Michael Bay and George Lucas have this bet going about who can utterly destroy our childhood icons more completely.  Sorry, Lucas; it takes a special kind of talent to do something so completely moronic that it insults the intelligence of every single person who sees it.  You at least, used to make great movies.  To be fair, he did totally rip off your moronic droid humor and racial caricaturing, though.  Bay has spent his entire career going out of his way to make film fans suffer.  You're just outclassed.  He's like the Andy Kaufman of filmmaking.  He just wants to see if we're stupid enough to buy into this so he can get his own laughs.  Even Lucas would never let Linkin Park score his film.  Those guys were out of date before their second album even dropped.  I'm putting money on Limp Bizkit for the next film.  Don't laugh.  Can I turn my brain off and enjoy the big dumb boominess of a film like this?  Absolutely.  But if a filmmaker is going to persistently kick me in the face with a slew of one-dimensional characters that each represents a single one-note joke repeated in every scene they are in and have them continue to build on each other until the entire film is a retarded symphony of extremely unfunny cliche then I'm not going to have a good time.  I realize Bay wants us to share and appreciate his love of explosions, but making every frame where nothing is exploding a living hell to sit through can make a 2 1/2 hour film rather tedious.  And I dare ANYBODY who is not an old-school superfan to name more then a few of the dozens of Transformers in this film.  Or more then 5 human characters for that matter.  2 1/2 hours is a long, long time to have zero character development aside from a contest between the two charisma-free leads to see who will say ""I love you"" first.  Guess what?  I didn't care!  I wanted them both to die.  There's not a single human I didn't want to die, really.  Kind of makes you wonder why they'd even bother.So there you have it.  ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" makes a great case for stupidest movie of the decade. There are stupider film out there, but this is the one that is not only stupid itself, but it proves how stupid we as a culture have become.  That is a monumental cinema achievement.  I gave it a chance since I enjoyed the first film, but my instinct to avoid paying to see it in the theater rang true.  If you could take the fantastic action scenes and hire a real science fiction writer who is a fan of the old show, this could have been something really special. But it's so like Hollywood to spare no expense on the special effects and marketing and just hire some random idiots to bang out some half-baked adolescent garbage for a script.  If we keep going to see this stuff, rest assured that they will keep it coming and continue to ignore anything of any actual quality.  I gave this a shot and it bricked right off of the backboard.  Now I'm taking my ball and I'm going home.  No more Shia ""world's biggest d-bag"" Lebouf, no more robots that make obnoxious animal noises and fart and tinkle all over the place, no more sub-grade school humor, no more WTF's.  I'm calling this whole thing off.",2,Don't be sucking this sack.,1256083200,"10 21, 2009",2009,7628,"['Bay', 'want', 'goddamn', 'brain', 'cells', 'back', 'once', 'while', 'movie', 'why', 'have',

My 9 year old son and I watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I had heard that this new installment was not meant for kids.  I just thought because of the action it had, but it was as if they said ""We really didn't have enough mindless idiotic humor so let's throw as much as possible in on this one.""  Everything from two male dogs having intercourse to crude humor.  Just terrible stuff.  Stuff that I'd have to take the time to explain to my kids NOT to say, or explain why two male dogs are doing it.  And there's even a part where a small transformer is gyrating on Megan Fox's leg.  And she doesn't mind.  I'm not a fan of her either.  Even some of the shots of her are very suggestive.  Like I said this stuff really spoiled it for me and I won't be showing this to my nine year old.  As far as the concept.  Great story, Shia Lebouf is great in this one as well.  The action and effects are INCREDIBLE, but too many low class humor, really brought down the integrity of the movie's potential.Too me, I'll forget this installment.

Hayes,"[1, 5]","In terms of the DVD itself, the Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Two Disc Special Edition DVD features, on the first disc the actual movie itself.  Transformers: ROTF was a moviTe that needed to be seen more than twice because of the fact that the CGI scenes were just so intense and large that one could not possibly everything there is to see during some of these shots, especially the transformation sequences. No matter what your opinion is of the plot of the film itself and what not, this was an impressive CGI film feat. That is really all there is on the first disc (well commentary by Micheal Bay, hes a hilarious guy)The second disc features a nearly 2 hour general feature on many of the processes of making the movie. Rather than splitting it into the usual segments, theyve just combined it into one huge 2 hour fest of things dealing with filming at each location, the actors, sound design, etc.  There is also a feature on the premiere in Japan, a feature on 25 years of Transformers, and a music video.  The 2 hours long one is in my opinion one of the best features Ive seen and with it so long, I wonder if there is even more stuff they left out for the DVD release. I could imagine they have extra stuff just lying around for a trilogy pack special edition in the future.For the price that Amazon offers this film, I would say it is definitely worth a rent, and a purchase if Transformers is your thing. Its a pretty solid offering, and for CGI buffs, this movie is awesome.

The later Harry Potters. Jurassic Park. Pirates of the Caribbean. The Matrix. Spider-Man. X-Men. The Dark Knight.I just listed off a number of movies that have spectacle and explosions and action and also manage to not forgo competent writing, storytelling, characterization and coherency. Keep them in mind as you read my review. You could make an argument for each one qualifying as a popcorn movie. I bring these movies up to highlight that just because a popcorn movie is a popcorn movie, that doesn't excuse it for being completely terrible in every way.Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is completely terrible in every way. Objectively speaking.RotF displays a shocking disregard for storytelling, in that there is no story. Almost every scene in the movie has nothing to do with the scene before or after it. If the plot of the Decepticons from the beginning was to sap the energy from the sun, why did it take over two hours of the ridiculously long run time for that to factor into anything? Why was so much time spent with Shia's parents? Why is the army involved at all? Robot heaven wtf? The movie was ""written"" during the writer's strike, meaning Michael Bay did most of the script work. I'm pretty sure he came up with a bunch of ideas that he thought were cool for a Transformers sequel and threw them all in without bothering to tie them together at all. The movie feels like it's making it up as it goes along, probably because it is.As for the characters, there are none. No character in this movie has an arc, no one changes at all. If there is an ""emotional core"" to this movie, it's that Shia Lebeouf is struggling to tell Megan Fox that he loves her. This might be an interesting premise in the hands of a good director, but in the hands of Michael Pearl Harbor Bay, it's utter garbage. I'd be shocked if anyone cares at all about Shia's and Megan's relationship in this movie, because there's nothing to care about. Also, pretty much every character in this movie is the comic relief. Shia's parents are comic relief. The racist robots are comic relief. Poor John Turturro is comic relief. Maybe this would be fine if any of it was even close to being funny, but it's not. It's all juvenile, offensive, painfully unfunny jokes. I've seen funnier canceled CBS sitcoms.Digging a little deeper, there is nothing to dig deeper into this movie. There's no overarching theme. There's no subtext to chew on. Everything is on the surface in RotF. Much like a lot of canceled CBS sitcoms.Ahh, but who cares about all of that! What about the ACTION and the EXPLOSIONS and the ROBOT ON ROBOT FIGHTING?! I'll again point out my list of movies above as a reminder that there are loads of movies that give us both good storytelling/writing/acting/characters and action, but I'll carry on because the action in RotF sucks as well. The action in RotF is technically impressive, I guess. The quality of the special effects is high. However, that is not the same thing as effective special effects. Sure, you get robots fighting each other, but there's no reason to care about any of it. There's no weight to anything. It's just a bunch of stuff that's happening. I see no difference between the action scenes in RotF and a montage on YouTube of NASCAR smash ups. Compare any action scene in this movie to the T-Rex fight scene in Peter Jackson's King Kong. While that movie certainly isn't perfect, that action scene is pretty darn good. In it, you know who the participants are, you know what's going on, and you know what's at stake. There is no action scene in RotF that accomplishes any of those things, especially at establishing stakes.To conclude, this movie is an objective failure in every way. I am beyond sick of defenders telling me to turn my brain off and enjoy it. There's nothing to enjoy. I don't understand why people accept this trash when there are so many movies that have the spectacle and are also simply good movies.

1164325,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0019M5C0Q,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 10]","Michael Bay's ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is, in a nutshell, a special effects extravaganza without any discernible story. You get more transforming robots, but no character(s) you can relate to. There are lots of actions and battles between the good and evil, but you just can't tell which is which, watching the hectic movements of the CG-created transformers that would make you dizzy.The fierce fight with the Decepticon forces continues in ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" This time the evil robots are planning something much more damaging to the Earth, and humans and autobots, or good robots, must stop them before it is too late. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox reprise their roles as Sam Witwicky and Mikaela Banes. Sam is going to college, leaving his gorgeous girlfriend in his hometown, but soon Sam learns that he has accidentally got a secret that the evil Decepticon leader really needs.Well, this is only the introduction. ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" runs about 150 minutes and the story defies easy summary simply because the story is actually non-existent. Like the two ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" sequels, the film takes up the story that should have ended in the original. Instead, the filmmakers have added new characters (humans and transformers), new locations and long, extended action sequences that are bigger and louder than before.Actually, this is not a bad thing. After all Michael Bay films (such as ""Pearl Harbor"" ""Armageddon"" ""The Rock"" and two ""Bad Boys"") have been known for actions and most of us are aware of that. To his credit, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" provides tons of actions with first-rate visual effects though I prefer less shaky camerawork.Sadly Michael Bay (and producer Steven Spielberg) has forgotten one important thing. Transformers are characters with their own personalities, not just machines. In the original ""Transformer"" the director tried to present them as characters and succeeded to some extent, in some of the scenes like comical interaction between Bumblebee (as a Camaro) and a human friend, Sam. In fact Shia LaBeouf's Sam was a pretty interesting character in the first ""Transformer,"" but here he just sleepwalks or overacts.In the sequel two new smaller Autobots appear as comic relief, but they sound more like two Jar Jar Binks. More irritating is Sam's parents, especially his mom, who goes berserk in the campus. Michael Bay (and Spielberg) was never good at doing comedy and he overreaches himself when he tries to make us laugh.Still the film's actions and visuals are amazing and for that alone, my 2.5 stars.",3,"(2.5 STARS) Lots of Actions, No Characters",1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,2617,"['Michael', 'Bay', 'Transformers', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'nutshell', 'special', 'effects', 'extravaganza', 'discernible', 'story', 'get', 'more', 'transforming', 'robots', 'character', 'can', 'relate', 'are', 'lots', 'actions', 'battles', 'good', 'evil', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'watching', 'hectic', 'movements', 'CG-created', 'transformers', 'would', 'make', 'dizzy.The', 'fierce', 'fight', 'Decepticon', 'forces', 'Transformers', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'time', 'evil', 'robots', 'are', 'planning', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'damaging', 'Earth', 'humans', 'autobots', 'good', 'robots', 'must', 'stop', 'too', 'late', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'reprise', 'roles', 'Sam', 'Witwicky', 'Mikaela', 'Banes', 'Sam', 'going', 'college', 'leaving', 'gorgeous', 'girlfriend', 'hometown', 'soon', 'Sam', 'accidentally', 'got', 'secret', 'evil', 'Decepticon', 'leader', 'really', 'needs.Well', 'only', 'introduction', 'Transformers', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', '150', 'minutes', 'story', 'defies', 'easy', 'summary', 'simply', 'story', 'actually', 'non-existent', 'two', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'sequels', 'film', 'up', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'original', 'Instead', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'added', 'new', 'characters', 'humans', 'transformers', 'new', 'locations', 'long', 'extended', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'bigger', 'louder', 'before.Actually', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'films', 'such', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Armageddon', 'Rock', 'two', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'actions', 'most', 'are', 'aware', 'credit', 'Transformers', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'tons', 'actions', 'first-rate', 'visual', 'effects', 'prefer', 'less', 'shaky', 'camerawork.Sadly', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'producer', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'forgotten', 'one', 'important', 'thing', 'Transformers', 'are', 'characters', 'own', 'personalities', 'not', 'just', 'machines', 'original', 'Transformer', 'director', 'tried', 'present', 'characters', 'succeeded', 'extent', 'scenes', 'comical', 'interaction', 'Bumblebee', 'Camaro', 'human', 'friend', 'Sam', 'fact', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Sam', 'was', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'character', 'first', 'Transformer', 'here', 'just', 'sleepwalks', 'overacts.In', 'sequel', 'two', 'new', 'smaller', 'Autobots', 'appear', 'comic', 'relief', 'sound', 'more', 'two', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'More', 'irritating', 'Sam', 'parents', 'especially', 'mom', 'who', 'berserk', 'campus', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'never', 'good', 'doing', 'comedy', 'when', 'make', 'laugh.Still', 'film', 'actions', 'visuals', 'are', 'amazing', 'alone', '2.5', 'stars']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

A lot of distributers try to cram in useless extras like U-Control and BDLIVE, that simply don't satisfy the people who actually watch special features.  Transformers 2 has a good block of behind the scenes footage, which is all that is necessary.  Separate extra segments with titles, but put them all in the same 2 hour chunk of time.  I was very impressed with my Blu-ray edition, and I'm sure they designed this disc solely with the audience and fans in mind.  Other stuff like interactive games and transformers history are on the disc as well, which might not be as entertaining, but interesting none the less.  My only issue with the disc(Not the film) would be that Michael Bay sounds way too self-righteous on the interview segments.  There's about a 20 minute segment explaining how he knows its a good movie and how critics should be ignored.  I give him a moment to justify himself, but it seemed like too much time was wasted on this subject on the commmentary and behind the scenes.Now as for the movie:  I happened to enjoy this film much more than the first one.  Main reason would be that the action sequences are a lot more crisp and clear.  I can actually see whats going on in the fights this time.  In the last film I had not a clue on who was kicking/punching/stabbing who.  I was glad to see that they greatly improved on this aspect, and took a wider shot approach, as opposed to the tight close ups.Ok.  This movie has been bashed and criticized in every which way and a lot of it I do agree with.  The film is not smart or dynamic, but the one thing it is, is.......entertaining!  It would not have sold so many tickets if it was not this entertaining.  Michael Bay is making a movie for not only adults, but children as well.  Hundreds of children would be left in the dust if Bay tried to make this film an intelligent action thriller.  He has to take shortcuts and write lots and lots of jokes to keep people entertained.  Otherwise why would we want to watch it more than once.  In order to sell so many tickets, he needed to make a huge action movie with comedy sprinkled all over it.  Yea, it's a little cheesy at times and some ""dramatic"" scenes feel like cheap tricks, but I still gotta say that it's great entertainment.  Those expecting another Dark Knight or Star Trek will be majorly dissapointed.  What this film is about is entertaining a WIDE audience.  And it looks like more of the common people were satisfied, rather than the smaller population of critics and skeptics.  I happened to like it because it's just good entertainment.  It looks beautiful and the action scenes work well, and I even laughed a few times.  Don't expect the film to move you in any way.  Just expect the beauty of it to blow your mind away.",5,Another Very Rewarding Blu-ray,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,2852,"['great', 'example', 'what', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'should', 'look', 'blu-ray', 'lot', 'distributers', 'try', 'cram', 'useless', 'extras', 'U-Control', 'BDLIVE', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'satisfy', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'Transformers', '2', 'good', 'block', 'scenes', 'footage', 'necessary', 'Separate', 'extra', 'segments', 'titles', 'put', 'same', '2', 'hour', 'chunk', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', ""'m"", 'sure', 'designed', 'disc', 'solely', 'audience', 'fans', 'mind', 'Other', 'stuff', 'interactive', 'games', 'transformers', 'history', 'are', 'disc', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'none', 'less', 'only', 'issue', 'disc', 'Not', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'way', 'too', 'self-righteous', 'interview', 'segments', '20', 'minute', 'segment', 'explaining', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'how', 'critics', 'should', 'be', 'ignored', 'give', 'moment', 'justify', 'seemed', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'wasted', 'subject', 'commmentary', 'scenes.Now', 'movie', 'happened', 'enjoy', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'first', 'one', 'Main', 'reason', 'would', 'be', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'crisp', 'clear', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'whats', 'going', 'fights', 'time', 'last', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'clue', 'who', 'was', 'kicking/punching/stabbing', 'who', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'greatly', 'improved', 'aspect', 'took', 'wider', 'shot', 'approach', 'opposed', 'tight', 'close', 'ups.Ok', 'movie', 'been', 'bashed', 'criticized', 'way', 'lot', 'do', 'agree', 'film', 'not', 'smart', 'dynamic', 'one', 'thing', '.entertaining', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'sold', 'so', 'many', 'tickets', 'was', 'not', 'entertaining', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'making', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'adults', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'Hundreds', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'dust', 'Bay', 'tried', 'make', 'film', 'intelligent', 'action', 'thriller', 'take', 'shortcuts', 'write', 'lots', 'lots', 'jokes', 'keep', 'people', 'entertained', 'Otherwise', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'order', 'sell', 'so', 'many', 'tickets', 'needed', 'make', 'huge', 'action', 'movie', 'comedy', 'sprinkled', 'Yea', 'little', 'cheesy', 'times', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'feel', 'cheap', 'tricks', 'still', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'great', 'entertainment', 'expecting', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Star', 'Trek', 'will', 'be', 'majorly', 'dissapointed', 'What', 'film', 'about', 'entertaining', 'WIDE', 'audience', 'more', 'common', 'people', 'were', 'satisfied', 'rather', 'smaller', 'population', 'critics', 'skeptics', 'happened', 'like', 'just', 'good', 'entertainment', 'beautiful', 'action', 'scenes', 'work', 'well', 'even', 'laughed', 'few', 'times', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'move', 'way', 'Just', 'expect', 'beauty', 'blow', 'mind', 'away']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

The first Transformers film I had a great case to show that it was a good movie. Now we have the sequeal. Same director, same actors and a few new robots.Let me be as consice as I can. If you want to see a movie with a great plot, oscar worthy performaces and an ending that will make you leap out of your seat an applaud. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! PUT A RESTRAINING ORDER ON IT IF YOU HAVE TO! Here is the honest truth about 'Revenge of the Fallen' The acting is the worst I have seen since 'Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'. I use this movie by comparison for good reason. My intentions for seeing 'Revenge of the Sith' or any of the 3 recent installmets to the Star Wars franchise had nothing to do with the expectations of seeing a movie that was perfect with no equal. No, I just wanted to see a Star Wars movie and get closure I wanted seeing Anakin Skywalker finally become Darth Vader. By the way if you are a reader that had no idea that THAT was the outcome of Star Wars then I should personally slap you around for a bit before you climbed back under the stone you crawled out from for at least 20 years of your life. Now that I have gone completly off topic I will get back to my review. The real reason I wanted to see this highly anticipated Transformers sequel was to see sweet looking plains trains and automobiles turn in to awesome kick keister robots and signature Michael Bay explosions! Also while the plot is about as shallow as the local kiddie pool a true fan of the Transformers cartoon will get a real treat of plot devices from the orgional show. The movie is loud, fun and ficken awesome. Apparently the movie did it's job at the box office because they have green lit the third installment.

1164330,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B0019M5C0Q,V. Berk,"[12, 21]","Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is one of the most desperate attempts I have ever seen by a movie in its desperate ideas of entertainment. Coming only two years after the release of the first Michael Bay Transformers I knew this movie was not going to be anything special, because a sequel that is pushed into completion within two years is never a good sign. Regardless, I decided to hop over to see this movie after having spent a wonderful time with Pixar's latest release, Up (more on that delightfully entertaining movie some other time).This is the first time I shall really spoil a movie's plot points in a review, because trust me, if you are a rational human being you shall stay clear from this movie knowing its clich&eacute; plot and offensive characters. If you don't want to be spoiled don't read any further, but trust me when I say, even if you enjoyed the fun popcorn film that was Transformers(2007).The movie begins with what we find to be an alliance between the military and the Autobots from the first film as they work together in an attempt to destroy all remaining Deceptacons on the planet Earth. I suppose this was a better idea than simply repeating the exact formula of the first film, but it's just handled very childishly. This entire idea leads up to a huge, explosion filled fight with some sort of giant wheel-bot, that after a few minutes seems to be giving the Autobots the slip (of course in a Michael Bay film a giant robot destroying much of a highway is easy to cover up by the government. Durr-hurr). But what's this? A military cargo plane is flying overhead and heroic music has kicked in! Can it be? My God, it is! Here comes the toy world's most beloved robot character, Optimus Prime! Only problem is that Optimus seems to think he's in a 1980s cop film, because I wouldn't be joking if I say the first thing he tells the tinker-toy from hell after parachuting onto it was "" Pull over!"" Great! Optimus Prime has now become RoboCop! By the way, get used to one-liners like this- they make up most of the movie's dialogue.The first problem I find in this is that the first film implied that the entire remaining robotic forces of both sides were on Earth and that there were not many others. The way this film is I believe there are THOUSANDS of Decepticons and Autobots still left in reserve and will probably be seen in some giant Lord of the Rings style battle when the third entry comes round, because as bad as this film is it will undoubtedly make a lot of money no matter how bad the word of mouth.The military involvement is vague and they are, as is sci-fi tradition, failing to help in any way! Have you ever once seen a sci-fi/action movie where World domination seeking robots are brought down by machine gun fire? Makes you wonder what the humans are doing here in the first place! They're probably cushions for the robots whenever they fall- don't want those bright paint jobs ruined. Well, that would explain why so many of the robots in this film have red on some part of their paint job.Cut through the opening credits and go to our loving family from the first film. These segments between Sam, his parents, Bumblebee, and Sam's mechanic girlfriend (played by more curves than brains actress Megan Fox) are something that totally turns to movie upside down whenever they occur. No longer are you watching a mindless Rock `Em Sock `Em movie, but you've gone into a sitcom I like to call ""That Robot Show."" Whether it be Sam's dogs humping each other or his mother randomly getting off on pot-brownies these segments will stoop to anything in vain attempts to make you laugh (as if the absurd action sequences aren't funny enough of a joke). The worst part about this is that there are more of these sitcom scenes than there are actual Robot-versus-Robot moments. I know this is a brainless movie but I would rather see brainless violence than laugh-less ""comic"" interludes.Speaking of vain attempts at humor let me move right along to perhaps the worst aspect of this entire mess of a film: The Twins. Where to even begin with these unpleasant characters...Throw Jar Jar Binks into a ghetto, blend him up and split him into two and that would sum up how incredibly annoying these characters are, and if their presence wasn't enough to bother you they've made sure to provide you one of the most offensive portrayals of African Americans you will ever see in a big-budget action film. These robots...even their design screams of racist stereotype. One of them has big lips, another has big ears, and one even has a gold tooth (!!). I don't know who approved these characters or this portion of the script during development but surely no rational being could have thought these characters to be a good idea.We also have some shameless rip-off of what appears to be The Terminator as a Deceptacon has taken to form of an attractive girl who seems to have her eyes set on Sam. You know something tells me that if I had the ability to take the form of humans I would use myself in a lot more productive manner than being a tease for college boys at Princeton (which seems to be a party university according to this film).None of the plot really makes sense other than to come up with as many cheesy one-liners and explosions as physically possible. When the bad guys chase Sam they don't pursue, or stalk him- they just choose to blow everything up at random. There is something called tension that even a bad film can pull off, and it does not involve constant wall-to-wall explosions. Go back to the first two Terminator films. Remember how intense it was to have our human characters in a factory where a deadly machine could be anywhere? This didn't involve any explosions, or gunshots, but it sure as hell managed to create tension and edge of your seat moments.This Transformers script came from the writing team of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who earlier this Summer movie season also had their names on the incredibly entertaining Star Trek reboot. So what went wrong with them in Transformers 2? Well, Star Trek had some racial stereotypes, and silly jokes, but they never became annoying or offensive to the viewers. Why? I give credit where credit is due, and that was the talent of director J.J. Abrams (Mission Impossible 3, TV's Lost). Unlike Michael Bay, Abrams knew what was worth cutting and what was worth keeping in, and the result was a movie that brought laughs, intense action, whimsical characters, visually stunning special effects, and to top it off it was edited to perfection, running just a bit over two-hours. Transformers 2 seems to have had little to no editing, running at two-hours, thirty-minutes and the director - Bay - seemed so content with what he was doing he never stopped to question what he was doing.The result of Transformers 2 is an overly long, boring movies with very few memorable characters or action sequences...At least 300 had fun action sequences to make up for its absurd, poorly written script- same case with the first Transformers. The action sequences of Transformers 2 are miserable to watch because you can't tell what's going on unless the cheesy slow-motion moments are thrown in (and one even has a bad shot of Optimus being punched in the face and having...PURPLE ROBOT BLOOD fly from his mouth).I'll admit to liking some movies that involve turning your brain down a notch, the first Transformers film being an example of this, but this movie just went too far. At two hours and twenty minutes I thought the first film was forty minutes too long and this sequel is only longer and much less comprehensible. Some people say these films are the exact same thing and I have to strongly disagree. In the first film you could find the characters enjoyable and sometimes even whimsical. This one everyone is a cardboard cutout. First film the special effects were enough to dazzle you. This one they are so elaborate and over developed that you often had trouble understanding what was going on! This movie is an attack on your senses, plain and simple, though it's bound to make plenty of money and a third film will undoubtedly be spawned I can only say that no one will be talking about this series five years from now. It is just a passing fancy, something pretty to look at, like the cars showcased in this movie.  Whoever kept Michael Bay in-check for the first film needs to come back.Only good part of the film is seeing the new Corvette Stingray. Now that's a nice car, but not something [...] Luckily I snuck into this mess and paid nothing (and even then I want a refund).",2,Letting Michael Bay off his leash was a bad idea...,1246492800,"07 2,

1164334,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0019M5C0Q,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[2, 5]","The first ""Transformers"" film may not be faithful to the animated series, not even to the comic book by Marvel comics. Seeing as how Hasbro only utilized those mediums to promote its toy line, I can forgive its inconsistencies to the beloved animated series. The original film by Michael Bay was fun, it utilized a simple formula with little room for a real intricate plot; it was just a popcorn film. After the huge box-office success of Bay's rendition of the ""Transformers"", of course there would be a sequel and ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" fulfills that promise. Bay main goal would have to make the sequel bigger while going deeper into the mythos of our transforming robots. In this sequel, one thing, Michael Bay proves once again is the fact that he is a good director of action sequences but the skill of great storytelling still ELUDES him. ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" may be louder and bigger--but it is definitely NOT better.Sam (Shia LeBeouf) is off to college. Life couldn't be better for the young man, he has a hot girlfriend named Michaela (devastatingly sexy Megan Fox) and his parents are very supportive. The Autobots led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) had joined forces with the U.S. military to hunt down the remaining Decepticons still on Earth. On the day that he is supposed to leave for college, Sam discovers a shard of the `Allspark' from an old sweater, the supposed source of life in Cybertron and his brain ends up being encoded with strange symbols. Prime and his companions come to the aid of the young man, and an encounter with the Decepticons end with a revived Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) sidelining the heroic Optimus Prime. Now it is up to Sam and Michaela to uncover the secret of the Transformers whose history spans hundreds of years on Earth. Aided by his roommate, Leo (miscast Ramon Rodriguez), former sector 7 agent, Simmons (John Turturro) and some old military friends (Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel), Sam must thwart the Fallen's machinations to bring about disaster by stealing the powers of the sun to make Energon through the powers of the ""leadership matrix"" key.I did not love the first film, but I thought it was fun and somewhat entertaining. It was a popcorn film that relied on slick hyper-editing tricks, CGI mayhem and visual disarray. ""Tranformers"" wasn't anything special but it was a crowd-pleaser, it appealed to mainstream audiences. Somewhere along the way, Michael Bay messed up an easy formula with ""Revenge of the Fallen"". This sequel is a display of pure undisciplined execution. One would ask; ""How can Bay mess up a simple formula?"" Well, it seemed like the director is trying too hard to outshine the original film by exercising the utmost minimum in restraint that relies mostly on rehearsed special effects and overbearing humor. I'm not sure whether he was trying to be funny or to be offensive.The problems with ""Revenge"" come mostly from its script.  I am not expecting a masterpiece or something that resembles an original plot, but the plot in this film totally uninspired. It's not that it didn't have some aces in the screenplay but somewhere along the way, Bay and company decided to opt for a comedic experience. The history of the robots is somewhat fleshed out, with the ""Fallen"" concept being brought into play. Unfortunately, any relevance to the film's main plot is downplayed by overdone annoying stereotypes in its characters; I am not just talking about the human characters, I am talking about the newer supporting cast of robots. (I will further elaborate in a minute) The Matrix key and the whole thing about the shards may hold some viability in the transformers mythos but sadly, the script falters, the film should be about the robots with the humans as the supporting element not the other way around. I would buy into the human-robot relationship and its significance but the film fails to fully realize this potential; it tosses in the idea but never develops it with emotion. I guess Bay thought that while the audience love to see robots fighting, they also like to laugh, so Bay and his writers puts a lot of emphasis on comedy; not just comic relief but actual comedy.The film brings a lot of comedy into the screenplay that it makes no emotional or narrative impact. The life and death stakes of saving the planet feels more like a backdrop than an actual inherent part of the screenplay. Any aces from its limited concept are diverted to useless detours from its narrative. The new robots feel like they're mere caricatures of certain stereotypes and the designs aren't impressive either. Most of the newer supporting robots act like they're rejects from some gangster comedy show. The twin `jive-talking' robots, Mudflap and Skids act like they're degenerates and play a very ethnic stereotype. I found their designs and behavior rather unnecessary and quite frankly may raise some racial flags. There is also a small Decepticon spy that behaves like a dog that it began to hump Megan Fox's leg. The film's script falls to many inadequacies and useless devices to try to entertain--to try badly. Using laughs as the central focus of the film diminishes the film's concept. I was NOT laughing at all.The question remains, does ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" deliver on the ""Heavy Metal"" combat scenes? Yes, it does. The fight between Optimus Prime and Megatron with two other Decepticons was real fun to watch; it was a true testament to the heroic traits of Optimus Prime. The final encounter between a ""maxed-out"" Optimus Prime and ""The Fallen"" one was pretty cool although it threw another wrench in the screenplay. There are plenty of robotic battles and while some of them are good, some are pretty mediocre. It does try to evolve the areas of robotic combat and violence, but most of the new faces such as Sidewinder are ignored. The idea of a human-like Decepticon is sadly also abandoned and not fully fleshed out. We see classic Autobots, Iron Hide, BumbleBee and Decepticons, Soundwave and Rampage. An Insecticon and the Constructicons also make an appearance but their ""Devastator"" looks like a washing machine on steroids. Megatron's master, the Fallen one does look menacing but looks too reminiscent of the Japanese mecha designs. There is also an old Decepticon defector that uses a cane? The battles are good, but most of them feel too routine and a practice in rehearsal--lots of explosions and CGI mayhem does not make the qualities of an epic battle. Peter Cullen does a great voice-acting as Optimus and Hugo Weaving sounds menacing as the sinister Megatron.The film also features returning characters into the mix. Familiar faces John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel reprises their roles from the original film. Turturro is somewhat entertaining but I really thought that Ramon Rodriguez was definitely a miscast as Leo. Shia LeBeouf is his usual over-acting self, that all he did to express emotion is to widen his eyes with his mouth open. Megan Fox is indeed a Fox! The actress is so seductive as the sexy Mikaela that even a sexy Decepticon (played by Isabel Lucas) almost couldn't compete. Sam's parents played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White weren't funny and the pot joke is the type that has been overused by other films.Maybe I'm being too harsh to the film, but I think I should try to tell the truth. While the film does have some decent gags, the comedy just overstays its welcome. This is a film that assumes that comedy is gold and a scene with two dogs humping the other is a viable plot device. Michael Bay further cements the impression that he DOES NOT care for the franchise at all, and that any success the original film enjoyed was a fluke. I am rather at a loss as to what target audience this film is geared to, that I cannot give it a recommended rating. I suppose to be optimistic, those who just want a mindless summer film, ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" may prove to be a minor diversion--but at 150 minutes the film proves too long. Bay isn't going to elevate this once-beloved franchise to new heights, and sadly, there are already hints at another sequel.It is a ""FALLEN"" sequel.RENT IT [2 - Stars]",3,How LOW Has the Mighty

When the Decepticons cook up another evil plan to destroy Earth, though, it isn't too long before Sam and Mikaela are once again teaming up with the Auto-Bots (as well as the U.S. military) to once again save the world.Simply put, this is the classic cinema case of ""same concepts, different packaging"".  The amounts of humor, pulse-pounding action, and plot (or lack thereof) are pretty much the same as the original, but director Michael Bay is able to keep the proceedings remarkably fresh.  Never once did I feel as if things were becoming ""old hat"".The key to enjoying this franchise (and even more so this film in particular) is this: have the ability to not take it seriously.  If you view these movies as strictly ""escapism"" entertainment, they will entertain you thoroughly.  Do they hold up to dissection?  Heck no.  But that isn't the point.As usual, LaBeouf pretty much steals every scene he is in as the young Witwicky.  He has the type of acting talent that perfectly meshed with the numerous ""just passed adolescence"" characters he played during this time period, and this makes Sam very relatable to the audience.Overall, I enjoyed ""Revenge of the Fallen"" nearly as much as its predecessor.  While the ""newness"" factor may have worn off a bit, this second effort (if viewed in the proper light) repackages the key elements of part one and lets us enjoy them again.  Despite all the negative publicity about this one, the Transformers fan who can fully immerse him/her self into the experience (without too much ""thinking"") CAN still have a blast watching this one.",5,Not A Let-Down,1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,2052,"['rousing', 'somewhat', 'unpredictable', 'success', 'first', 'Transformers', 'film', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'Co.', 'set', 'out', 'capture', 'winning', 'formula', 'once', 'again', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'much', 'critical', 'panning', 'even', 'outright', 'derision', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'consider', 'let-down', 'way', 'shape', 'form.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Transformers', '2', 'sees', 'Sam', 'Witwicky', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'entering', 'college', 'leaving', 'girlfriend', 'Mikaela', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'behind', 'When', 'Decepticons', 'cook', 'up', 'evil', 'plan', 'destroy', 'Earth', 'though', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'before', 'Sam', 'Mikaela', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'teaming', 'up', 'Auto-Bots', 'as', 'well', 'U.S.', 'military', 'once', 'again', 'save', 'world.Simply', 'put', 'classic', 'cinema', 'case', 'same', 'concepts', 'different', 'packaging', 'amounts', 'humor', 'pulse-pounding', 'action', 'plot', 'lack', 'thereof', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'original', 'director', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'able', 'keep', 'proceedings', 'remarkably', 'fresh', 'Never', 'once', 'did', 'feel', 'things', 'were', 'becoming', 'old', 'hat', 'key', 'enjoying', 'franchise', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'film', 'particular', 'have', 'ability', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'view', 'movies', 'strictly', 'escapism', 'entertainment', 'will', 'entertain', 'thoroughly', 'Do', 'hold', 'up', 'dissection', 'Heck', ""n't"", 'point.As', 'usual', 'LaBeouf', 'pretty', 'much', 'steals', 'scene', 'young', 'Witwicky', 'type', 'acting', 'talent', 'perfectly', 'meshed', 'numerous', 'just', 'passed', 'adolescence', 'characters', 'played', 'time', 'period', 'Sam', 'very', 'relatable', 'audience.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'predecessor', 'newness', 'factor', 'may', 'have', 'worn', 'off', 'bit', 'second', 'effort', 'viewed', 'proper', 'light', 'key', 'elements', 'part', 'one', 'enjoy', 'again', 'negative', 'publicity', 'one', 'Transformers', 'fan', 'who', 'can', 'fully', 'immerse', 'him/her', 'self', 'experience', 'too', 'much', 'thinking', 'CAN', 'still', 'have', 'blast', 'watching', 'one']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

However that night I left the theaters disapointed. The reason I felt this way is because there was not a very good plot. I think the biggest reason why this movie made such a large sum of money is because of the special effects, all the transforming and Meghan Fox.I thought there was good acting in this film but if there is not a very good plot good acting can only carry a film so far.",2,Not as good as the box-office shows,1271808000,"04 21, 2010",2010,506,"['When', 'went', 'theaters', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'alot', 'had', 'already', 'earned', 'good', 'sum', 'money', 'However', 'night', 'left', 'theaters', 'disapointed', 'reason', 'felt', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'think', 'biggest', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'made', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'special', 'effects', 'transforming', 'Meghan', 'Fox.I', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'good', 'acting', 'can', 'only', 'carry', 'film', 'so', 'far']",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

Actually it is pretty simple. The writers took what was annoying fromthe first movie amplified it in full force.I HATED his mother in this movie. I don't know any woman her age that acts her way.You would have thought a 12 year old wrote this.Between the lame ""deaths"" of Optimus and Sam to the constant crude and sex jokes that were so overdone overused, you lost interest in the lame story to begin with.Megatron all of a sudden wants to be the slave of the Fallen???? HUH????Megatron bows to no one except a planet eating Transformer called Unicron(80's animated movie)and in that movie, HE STILL RESISTED BEING CONTROLLED. Total deviation from g1 character.He could have atleast made him galvatron when they rebuilt him, I could have tolerated that.Instead of a decent plot and lead to climactic battle, we get overdone jokes and lots of unneccesary scenes.Devastator had a weak presence in the movie, he eats things, wow big whoop dee do.Read the novel instead. Megatron acts more like Megatron, he doesn't care when the fallen is killed and he awakes the sleeping decepticon army.But you didn't see this because we were too busy:Watching the mother act like a jerk and eat marijana induced brownies, a huge closeup of a man's butt wearing a speedo, dogs humping toys, themselves and the robot humping Megan Fox's leg.In short WAAAY too many lame scenes and not enough cool scenes.I enjoyed the first movie. This crude immature CGI crapfest was a complete dissappointment.For those who have not seen it, wait for it on cable and save yourselves the $$$.If there is a third installment. Michael.
