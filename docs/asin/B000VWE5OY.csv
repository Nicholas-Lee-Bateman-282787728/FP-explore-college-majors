Took me a few years to take a peek. I'm real picky about my Time Lords. Maybe that why I dig Jack and his motley crew. He's not quite a Time Lord yet, just another schmuck caught in a bizarre loop of cosmic wonder while carnage and Armageddon storm down a shadowy alley. They get rid of narcissus-lizard Owen, which is an improvement, but they also get rid of Sato, not so great. But Jack is still around, and his maddeningly perfect features make up for his maddeningly perfect features. Gwen evolves from curious imp into bossy denmother, and sadly the sexual tension between her and Jack is put on the back burner because of faulty contraceptives. But Torchwood: Miracle Day promises more of the same but with palm trees and probably American guest stars.My absolute favorite parts of Torchwood are the graphics and the theme music. The opening theme has got great spooky vocals, the closing theme is this amazing eclectic mash-up that uses elements of the original Dr. Who theme. But the show is OK. They work with a time rift that lets in the flotsam and jetsam of our interdimensional multiuniverses. Aliens and crap.

1104297,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B000VWE5OY,Allan M. Lees,"[3, 4]","My children and I recently discovered the new Doctor Who programs and we were impressed by the intelligent scripts, the superior direction and sometimes outstanding acting.  This prompted me to order the anagram series Torchwood, billed as ""a grownup sci-fi.""  Doctor Who lead writer Russell T Davies conceived Torchwood and wrote the initial episode, which seemed to be very promising.Alas, the reality fails to deliver on the promise.  The scripts don't provide us with a ""way in"" to the central characters and thus we never really come to care about them and their travails.  The challenges they face - aliens and other oddities crossing a temporal rift to invade Cardiff - are too simplistic and monotonic.  Some of the scripts struggle for relevance (for example, Meat, in which ordinary people are not for the last time the villains) but the single-episode story format is too confining.  Although Torchwood is supposed to be for adults, the scripts are actually much less intelligent than those for Doctor Who.  It's a shame, because the actors here are probably capable of much more, if only they had better material to work with.  Torchwood seems to be striving to be a less banal version of the X-Files but in the end doesn't rise to anything more than forgettable filler.Several reviewers have commented on the sexual aspects of the series but in reality there's very little sexuality on display, and that which is shown is just kissing and loving gazes.  Americans may get worked up over the same-sex stuff but let's face it: any for-adults European show is going to contain material that US citizens will find disturbing.  There's a huge cultural gap between Europeans and Americans and Torchwood reflects that, but it's not really integral to the show, any more than are the ringtones on their mobile (cellular) phones or the fact that despite all the high-tech stuff they don't seem to be able to get frame-mounted tactical lights and laser target acquisition devices for their handguns.In short, this is a series that could use a serious make-over in the scripting department, with a lot more emphasis on plot and character development.  If Doctor Who can assume that its audience of children is capable of following clues and subtle hints and can handle emotion to a considerable degree, why on earth would Torchwood miss out on precisely the things that made its parent series so compelling?  Davies clearly needs to return to the concept and beef it up, or the BBC should do the decent thing and opt for euthanasia.",3,Undeveloped concept spin-off,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,2534,"['children', 'recently', 'discovered', 'new', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'programs', 'were', 'impressed', 'intelligent', 'scripts', 'superior', 'direction', 'sometimes', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'prompted', 'order', 'anagram', 'series', 'Torchwood', 'billed', 'grownup', 'sci-fi', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'lead', 'writer', 'Russell', 'T', 'Davies', 'conceived', 'Torchwood', 'wrote', 'initial', 'episode', 'seemed', 'be', 'very', 'promising.Alas', 'reality', 'deliver', 'promise', 'scripts', 'do', ""n't"", 'provide', 'way', 'central', 'characters', 'thus', 'never', 'really', 'come', 'care', 'travails', 'challenges', 'face', 'aliens', 'other', 'oddities', 'crossing', 'temporal', 'rift', 'invade', 'Cardiff', 'are', 'too', 'simplistic', 'monotonic', 'scripts', 'struggle', 'relevance', 'example', 'Meat', 'ordinary', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'last', 'time', 'villains', 'single-episode', 'story', 'format', 'too', 'confining', 'Torchwood', 'supposed', 'be', 'adults', 'scripts', 'are', 'actually', 'much', 'less', 'intelligent', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'shame', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'probably', 'capable', 'much', 'more', 'only', 'had', 'better', 'material', 'work', 'Torchwood', 'be', 'striving', 'be', 'less', 'banal', 'version', 'X-Files', 'end', ""n't"", 'rise', 'anything', 'more', 'forgettable', 'filler.Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'sexual', 'aspects', 'series', 'reality', 'very', 'little', 'sexuality', 'display', 'shown', 'just', 'kissing', 'loving', 'gazes', 'Americans', 'may', 'get', 'worked', 'up', 'same-sex', 'stuff', 'let', 'face', 'for-adults', 'European', 'show', 'going', 'contain', 'material', 'US', 'citizens', 'will', 'find', 'disturbing', 'huge', 'cultural', 'gap', 'Europeans', 'Americans', 'Torchwood', 'not', 'really', 'integral', 'show', 'more', 'are', 'ringtones', 'mobile', 'cellular', 'phones', 'fact', 'high-tech', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'frame-mounted', 'tactical', 'lights', 'laser', 'target', 'acquisition', 'devices', 'handguns.In', 'short', 'series', 'could', 'use', 'serious', 'make-over', 'scripting', 'department', 'lot', 'more', 'emphasis', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'can', 'assume', 'audience', 'children', 'capable', 'following', 'clues', 'subtle', 'hints', 'can', 'handle', 'emotion', 'considerable', 'degree', 'why', 'earth', 'would', 'Torchwood', 'miss', 'out', 'precisely', 'things', 'made', 'parent', 'series', 'compelling', 'Davies', 'clearly', 'return', 'concept', 'beef', 'up', 'BBC', 'should', 'do', 'decent', 'thing', 'opt', 'euthanasia']",Torchwood: Season 1

After much catching up on Dr. Who, I decided to give this a try.As many others have written a reviews complete with spoilers, I will simply share a few thoughts here.I completely enjoyed this series. There are many differences between this show and Dr. Who. There are a few similarities. Those who enjoy Dr. Who but would like a little bit more darkness in their shows will most likely enjoy this.Why did I rate this a low five? Mainly because it is a bit more risque than I prefer. It addresses adult issues such as same sex couples, bisexual preferences etc. And really, it doesn't address them so much as it is a way of life for many of these characters. For me, the good thing was that it didn't turn this show into a political statement - it just simply was a part of this show.Torchwood is more like one of those shows that would be shown after nine here in the U.S. when I was a kid. It has enough scenes that indicate sex is occurring or has recently occurred to be risque.  Some examples might be- Gwen walks in on the main Jack Harkness and another man and you can clearly see buttocks and male on male kissing.  There is some drug use. And even some alien cruelty, which completely bothered me- much like hearing about someone being mean to the neighbor dog. There is also swearing. While these things might not bother some/many people, it is worth noting prior to watching this series, that there will be some who find it offensive.I loved the aliens and I loved the mysteries that they solved and the problems they solved. It is a fairly fast paced show with quite a variety of shows in each season. To be honest, I would have continued watching this show if there had been more seasons/shows to watch.Enjoy.",4,"Low Five, high Four",1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,1794,"['fan', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'will', 'often', 'find', 'one', 'off', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'much', 'catching', 'up', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'decided', 'give', 'try.As', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'written', 'reviews', 'complete', 'spoilers', 'will', 'simply', 'share', 'few', 'thoughts', 'here.I', 'completely', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'are', 'many', 'differences', 'show', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'are', 'few', 'similarities', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'would', 'like', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'darkness', 'shows', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'this.Why', 'did', 'rate', 'low', 'five', 'Mainly', 'bit', 'more', 'risque', 'prefer', 'adult', 'issues', 'such', 'same', 'sex', 'couples', 'bisexual', 'preferences', 'etc', 'really', ""n't"", 'address', 'so', 'much', 'way', 'life', 'many', 'characters', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'show', 'political', 'statement', 'just', 'simply', 'was', 'part', 'show.Torchwood', 'more', 'one', 'shows', 'would', 'be', 'shown', 'nine', 'here', 'U.S.', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'enough', 'scenes', 'indicate', 'sex', 'occurring', 'recently', 'occurred', 'be', 'risque', 'examples', 'might', 'be-', 'Gwen', 'walks', 'main', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'man', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'buttocks', 'male', 'male', 'kissing', 'drug', 'use', 'even', 'alien', 'cruelty', 'completely', 'bothered', 'me-', 'much', 'hearing', 'someone', 'being', 'mean', 'neighbor', 'dog', 'also', 'swearing', 'things', 'might', 'not', 'bother', 'some/many', 'people', 'worth', 'noting', 'prior', 'watching', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'find', 'loved', 'aliens', 'loved', 'mysteries', 'solved', 'problems', 'solved', 'fairly', 'fast', 'paced', 'show', 'variety', 'shows', 'season', 'be', 'honest', 'would', 'have', 'continued', 'watching', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'seasons/shows', 'watch.Enjoy']",Torchwood: Season 1

1104309,A2VMT89TCSF105,B000VWE5OY,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[2, 2]","""Torchwood"" is a British science fiction series, shown in the United States on BBC America.The series is a ""Doctor Who"" spin off. While ""Doctor Who"" is considered a family show, ""Torchwood"" is more adult in content. It contains explicit sex, gruesome murders and some pretty nasty aliens. Most characters turn out to be bisexual. Indeed, the fictitious Torchwood Institute seems to be a veritable LGBT love fest!The closest thing ""Star Trek"" ever came to homosexuality were a couple of strange alien races. ""Torchwood"" is the real thing. How about same-sex kissing between Allied officers in pretty uniforms (one of them a time traveller), interracial lesbian sex with a shape shifting alien, or swinging from a straight robot to a gay human? Well, at least they have diversity on this show!Weirdly, the plot is set in Cardiff, Wales. Hardly a place anyone would consider the gay capital of Britain. The story revolves around the Torchwood Institute, a secretive operation charged with hunting down aliens from outer space and retrieve alien technology. The leader of the operation is one Jack Harkness, a mysterious human with supernatural abilities whose real identity is never revealed in the first season (of course, avid viewers of ""Doctor Who"" know exactly who he is). A rift in space-time runs right across Cardiff, turning the city into some kind of alien boomtown. Most fascinating are the Weewils, monstrous aliens living in the sewage system but occasionally making it to the surface, attacking people. To make the story a little bit more believable, the Torchwood Institute controls a drug known as Retcon, which wipes out the memories of everyone who ever sees the aliens. Torchwood are, after all, above the government and beyond the police!So far, three seasons of ""Torchwood"" has been produced. I originally only watched the second season, and drew the hasty conclusion that the show isn't much to write home about. The last couple of weeks, I've also been watching the first season episodes on Swedish TV. They are much better. In the second season, the monsters are just too corny and the characters too weirdly depressed. One of them even becomes a zombie. The first season also borders the corny at times (what about the cannibals? Or Abaddon?), but overall it's perfectly acceptable.Unless, of course, you have a problem with bisexuals...",4,Torchwood is gay,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,2359,"['Torchwood', 'British', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'shown', 'United', 'States', 'BBC', 'America.The', 'series', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'spin', 'off', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'considered', 'family', 'show', 'Torchwood', 'more', 'adult', 'content', 'explicit', 'sex', 'gruesome', 'murders', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'aliens', 'Most', 'characters', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'bisexual', 'Indeed', 'fictitious', 'Torchwood', 'Institute', 'be', 'veritable', 'LGBT', 'love', 'fest', 'closest', 'thing', 'Star', 'Trek', 'ever', 'came', 'homosexuality', 'were', 'couple', 'strange', 'alien', 'races', 'Torchwood', 'real', 'thing', 'How', 'same-sex', 'kissing', 'Allied', 'officers', 'pretty', 'uniforms', 'one', 'time', 'traveller', 'interracial', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'shape', 'shifting', 'alien', 'swinging', 'straight', 'robot', 'gay', 'human', 'Well', 'least', 'have', 'diversity', 'show', 'Weirdly', 'plot', 'set', 'Cardiff', 'Wales', 'Hardly', 'place', 'anyone', 'would', 'consider', 'gay', 'capital', 'Britain', 'story', 'Torchwood', 'Institute', 'secretive', 'operation', 'charged', 'hunting', 'down', 'aliens', 'outer', 'space', 'retrieve', 'alien', 'technology', 'leader', 'operation', 'one', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'mysterious', 'human', 'supernatural', 'abilities', 'real', 'identity', 'never', 'revealed', 'first', 'season', 'course', 'avid', 'viewers', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'know', 'exactly', 'who', 'rift', 'space-time', 'runs', 'right', 'Cardiff', 'turning', 'city', 'kind', 'alien', 'boomtown', 'Most', 'fascinating', 'are', 'Weewils', 'monstrous', 'aliens', 'living', 'sewage', 'system', 'occasionally', 'making', 'surface', 'attacking', 'people', 'make', 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'believable', 'Torchwood', 'Institute', 'drug', 'known', 'Retcon', 'out', 'memories', 'everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'aliens', 'Torchwood', 'are', 'government', 'police', 'So', 'far', 'three', 'seasons', 'Torchwood', 'been', 'produced', 'originally', 'only', 'watched', 'second', 'season', 'drew', 'hasty', 'conclusion', 'show', ""n't"", 'much', 'write', 'home', 'last', 'couple', 'weeks', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'Swedish', 'TV', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'second', 'season', 'monsters', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'corny', 'characters', 'too', 'weirdly', 'depressed', 'One', 'even', 'zombie', 'first', 'season', 'also', 'corny', 'times', 'what', 'cannibals', 'Abaddon', 'overall', 'perfectly', 'acceptable.Unless', 'course', 'have', 'problem', 'bisexuals']",Torchwood: Season 1

Sadly, I was bored to tears before I got to the second disc, and quite halfway through that one. It was just dull -- badly written, badly paced, poorly acted. In particular, the central character of Jack Harkness is played with one of the worst Brits-doing-an-American accent performances I've ever seen, a stiff, unconvincing, pale imitation of Tom Cruise-ish macho cool... Which is weird since Great Britain has no shortage of fine actors who are perfectly capable of doing spot-on Americanisms.

I don't have a problem with gay characters or references, but in Torchwood's first few episodes all the gay and bi-sexual content does nothing to advance the plot. The atheism in the first episode also serves no purpose. I have heard that Russel T. Davis is gay and watching this almost feels like him saying ""I am gay and an athiest and am going to work that in wherever I can."" Mr. Davis did a wonderful job of reviving Doctor Who, but I think Torchwood should have undergone a few more rewrites.

It's currently mid-way through its US run on BBC America.I have to say I was really excited about Torchwood when I heard it was going to be shown in the US. I fell in love with the character of Captain Jack on Doctor Who and I think Russell T. Davies has done an absolutely phenomenal job in resurrecting the Doctor, so I was expecting more of the same greatness. But the first episode was quite a jolt - and not necessarily in a good way; but I haven't tuned out in the hopes the episodes would get better - and there have been a couple that I did enjoy quite a bit - ""They Keep Killing Suzie"" is a particular favorite. I really appreciated the subject matter as death and whether or not there is an afterlife is a question I ponder often. Their answer to it in this episode is more than a little chilling.My one complaint with the series is the sex. Now, I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination and I do believe that when well placed, sex can add to and enhance the story. But some of the instances in Torchwood are truly cringe-worthy and actually detract from the story. Take ""Cyberwoman"" for example. Who is gonna sit there and make out when you're being hunted by a killing machine? There are other instances throughout the series that have left me scratching my head, wondering, ""what was the point of that?""That's my major beef with it; however, I haven't turned off the telly yet and I have seen some improvement as the series progresses. And to be quite honest, there's a zinger at the end of Doctor Who: Series Three that will probably compel me to tune into Torchwood: Series Two.

Of the supporting characters, there are problems as well, including too much rebellion and conflict among the team - they are, after all, people we're supposed to like and want to invite into our homes on TV or DVD, but all too often they aren't.All of that said, some of these stories are fantastic, and I'm excited to see what they come up with for their second season!

Melendez,"[16, 18]","I've never watched a single episode of Dr. Who, so if you are feeling a bit undecided on TW because it's a spin-off of Dr.Who and you've never watched the Dr. any way, then don't be. I have been watching TW since the 1st episode and I love it. It has a lot of action, drama, humor and there is some same-sex snogging(kissing) so if that bothers you don't watch. It all centers around a group of people that work at TW an organization that was formed to deal with alien threats on Earth. There are a few TW offices and this one happens to be in Cardiff, where Captain Jack says there is a rift in time and ""things"" from ""out there"" keep popping up in Cardiff. The series begins with the introduction of Police Constable Gwen Cooper, our link to TW so to speak for we are as lost as Gwen is when she stumbles on them. There is Captain Jack Harkness a guy from the future and the past, Ianto Jones the ""gopher"" coffee/tea maker but he will become much more then that in due time, Owen the doctor and resident ladies man, Toshiko the computer wiz.To give you an idea of the series here are the episodes and a brief discription, no spoilers promise,and rating 1star worst 5 stars great.:Epi.1: Everything Changes- Gwen Cooper comes across TW, and Jack discovers that rules aren't always followed. 5*Epi.2: Day One- TW has to stop a sex addicted alien as it leaves a trail of dead bodies.5*Epi.3: Ghost Machine- Gwen gets hold of an alien object that gives you visions of past crimes.4*Epi.4: Cyberwoman- Ther's a dark secret in the basement of the Hub. Even jack is unawareof it, but Ianto knows.And he'll go to any lengths, sacrifice anything and anyone, to protect what's down there.5*Epi.5: Small Worlds- A withdrawn child has some very gruesome friends.4*Epi.6: Countrycide- TW team goes investigating in a deserted village and find themselves out of their elements.5*Epi.7: Greeks Bearing Gifts- Tosh gains the ability to read minds after receiving a special gift.4*Epi.8: They Keep Killing Suzie- A series of murders are linked to Torchwood, Jack and the crew turn to the one thing that might help, resurrect Suzie Costello. But was this a fluke or does Suzie have other plans?5*Epi.9: Random Shoes- The invisible spirit of a hit and run victim tries to convince Gwen to locate the alien that might have been responsible for his death.4*Epi.10: Out of Time- A 1950's passenger plane arrives in 21st century Cardiff, can the TW team help them assimilate to modern life?5*Epi.11: Combat- The team discovers a ring of that are kidnapping Weevils (aliens) for there own mixed up reasons.3*Epi.12: Captain Jack Harkness- The Captain and Toshiko are transported to WWII Cardiff, there Toshiko soon finds out that being Japanese at this time is not that good and they meet the real Capt. Jack. Back in the present the rest of the team have to battle there own demons in order to find a way to bring their friends back, but things are going to go horribly wrong.5*Epi.13: End of Days- The rift is splintering, strange things are happening all around the world.These events resemble those in the prophecy of the arrival of Abaddon, the Great Devourer, who will lead the world into shadow and bring about the End of Days...5*So ends season 1 of this great series, I recommend you get it in Blu Ray because this is one of the few shows that is actually filmed in HD, and it looks incredible. I really like the interaction between the characters and the way they all seem like very rounded individuals and not paper cut outs.

The basic premise of the show is not ever really written into the storyline.  The idea that something big is going t hit in the 21st century and they are preparing for it, really?  How?  When?  None of the characters know what they are preparing for but jack, just dealing with stuff that comes up.  By the end of the season they have at least professed to be collecting alien and alien technology in preparation, but we don't really see a lot of aliens or alien tech.  It is focused on a rift in the time-space continuum in the writing, and in the shows plots.  There is no real character development in the traditional sense of writing, other then Gwen.  Some with Jack, but more in regards to that he is a mystery.So get past that you just jump into a story full speed ahead, and that the assertion of the shows introduction doesn't really align with the writing, and you still somehow get a show that is entertaining to watch.  Given this is entertainment that isn't so bad.  The mystery to Jack in coming season makes you ask why, when revealed who cares?  People die, weird stuff goes on from catastrophic to x-files weird but show just clunks along and basically entertains episode to episode making it worth watching.

1104393,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B000VWE5OY,Graves,"[3, 7]","Although called a spin off of the BBC's wildly successful ""Dr Who,"" Torchwood really does stand alone. Set in modern Cardiff it is a team of experts to who monitor, contain and if need be, elminate aliens that come to earth. Very much like a mix of Will Smith's MIB done in the style of the X-Files and it works.The team is led by captain Jack Harkness, an immortal alien who passes for human, played convincingly by John Barrowman who has the same mannerisms and charm as Tom Cruise, but in a frame that's 6 feet tall. The rest of the team tends to be attractive, techy nerds who are caught up in their world and drift a little out of touch with humanity. The touchstone for the team and the show is Eve Myles, who plays Gwen, a Cardiff policewoman who in the pilot see's the Torchwood team in action and starts to probe into this secretive group, finding out along the way that a little knowledge is very, very dangerous.Gwen is the character we, the viewers, link to. She is the 'common man' through whose eyes we see the alien interaction that the others have become jaded with. As a policewoman she is tough enough to hold her ground when things invariably go wrong and as a person saying 'you gotta be kidding"", she is the one the viewers relate to.The overall  effect is dark and and current and frighteningly believable. With a serious  note this is NOT for small children. There is sex and violence and while not graphic, it is rather more than we're use to on American TV. For example in the first episode after the pilot an alien inhabits a human woman who needs to feed by having sex with men. The act destroys her victimsd, reducing them to a pile of dust.If I do have a problem with this otherwise excellent program, it's Cardiff. The show is set there because it's produced through BBC Wales who's offices are in Cardiff so it keeps unnessary production costs down. It looks very nice. I don't have a problem with the Welch. The show even gives an explanation for why they are based in Cardiff, but in all honesty, it's like staging ""CSI:Helena, Montana."" In the pilot one of the policemen even jokes about how boring ""CSI:Cardiff"" would be, so they're in on the joke, but still.

So I bought the Torchwood Series 1 without having seen any of the episodes on TV, just from my love of sci-fi and the carryforward of Captain Jack.  Torchwood's writing is no where near as good as David Tennant's new Dr. Who series.  The sci-fi in Torchwood sometimes takes a back seat to the character drama.  The last couple episodes of season 1 devolved into soap opera. I watched the whole series with my 14-year old daughter.  During these last episodes, we started doing chores while watching, that's how uninteresting they were. And, worst of all, we started (correctly) predicting what was going to happen next. As a sci-fi lover, it's still got some interesting stuff.  But too often, the characters' actions aren't believable.  This is some government funded super-shop, and yet, Captain Jack's employees very frequently act like untrained idiots. Over and Over. And them acting like idiots will take up 20 minutes at a time. Overall, if you love sci-fi excitement, I would recommend David Tennant as Dr. Who as a much better show.  If you like standard sit-com drama, then you may be more appreciative of Torchwood. Oh, and, yes, Torchwood is more ""adult-oriented"" than Dr. Who.  But they've said that from the beginning.  Sometimes, the ""adult"" stuff works well with a storyline, like when Captain Jack meets his namesake. Othertimes, though, it's more like filler to get the ratings up (sleaze) or it's filler to use up time (instead of good writing).  I really hope that the next season has better storylines, because there's great potential.

1104400,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000VWE5OY,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[154, 166]","Some SPOILERS here.TORCHWOOD, a spinoff of DOCTOR WHO, is yet another television show with nifty science-fiction and paranormal elements, and it IS a marvelous and fun show. The premise: the Torchwood Institute is a covert organization given the responsibility of being Great Britain's watchdog against all things malicious and extraterrestrial. This series revolves around the amazing exploits of Torchwood Three, a branch of the Torchwood Institute which operates out of Cardiff, Wales.In the debut episode ""Everything Changes,"" Policewoman Constable Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) witnesses a deceased stab victim's temporary return to life. This becomes her introduction to a hidden world of frightening monsters, incomprehensible alien technologies, and extreme paranoia. She meets the very charming Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a man displaced in time and leader of Torchwood Three. Oh, and he can't die. He obligingly places Gwen in the loop: ""We don't just catch aliens. We scavenge the stuff they leave behind, find ways of using it, arming the human race against the future."" Fairly soon, after some fairly interesting - not to mention, harrowing - moments, Gwen finds herself recruited as the group's police liaison. And with a spacetime rift located in Wales, she and the other Torchwood members remain up to their necks in weirdness and peril. On a more personal scale, Gwen struggles to maintain a normal relationship with her lived-in boyfriend. It's not easy being Scully.I happened to stumble onto this dark, moody series on the On Demand's BBC America channel and became speedily hooked. It's done by the Brits and they bring their sensibilities to the table. Its tone, while somewhat reminiscent of the X-FILES, also does remind me a bit of DOCTOR WHO, but that one's to be expected as these two shows are closely linked. In fact, the word ""Torchwood"" is an anagram of Doctor Who and was a security code used by the crew of that series to foil television piracy.The sci-fi elements naturally loom large. The show immediately immerses the audience in its peculiar and scary universe lurking just behind the veil of normality. Cool and wondrous gadgets and concepts abound: perception filters, invisible lifts, ghost machines, time rifts, resurrection gloves - you know, screwy science-run-amok stuff. The show's contents do tend to stray toward more adult themes, and the casual use of earthy language underscores this. As a reflection of this maturity, the show isn't shy in depicting several of the team members as leaning towards an alternative lifestyle. Captain Jack Harkness himself is bisexual and disarmingly casual about it. In the sexually-charged ""Day One"" the baddie is a snog-happy (wonderful word, ""snog"") space creature who snuffs out its victims at the moment of orgasm (As Jack off-handedly comments regarding one casualty: ""He just...came and went.""). So, no, not for the young 'uns, this show.There are 13 episodes in the first series, and they are thoughtful and lushly plotted and just as splashy as their American counterparts. The CG is certainly there. The mostly British actors are very good. Gwen Cooper is played by Welsh actress Eve Myles, and Gwen makes for an engaging and ideal point-of-view character. The popular Captain Jack Harkness, last seen in the DOCTOR WHO series, comfortably crosses over into this show and drags actor John Barrowman with him. Barrowman, by the way, is magnetic! The cast of characters is interesting and complex and develops as the series progresses, with team members keeping their share of dark and dangerous secrets. One of them even turns traitor, dies, and comes back from the dead. Needless to say, the group dynamics tend to be volatile.One negative is that most of the episodes are self-contained, which introduces a certain faltering in overall cohesion and continuity. However, the episodes will still suck you in. The best ones, in my opinion, are ""They Keep Killing Susie"" (Former Torchwood member Susie Costello returns), ""Out of Time"" (great and melancholy episode with three aircraft passengers from 1953 disembarking in the present and forced to acclimate to this brave new world), ""Captain Jack Harkness"" (very good time travel story as Jack and Toshiko journey temporaly to 1941 and meet the real Captain Jack Harkness, whose identity Torchwood's Jack would soon steal), and the exciting season finale ""End of Days"" (Wales' time rift becomes unstable and begins causing disturbing temporal anomalies).Hmm, the Doctor Who universe seems to be rapidly expanding. First, this riveting Torchwood offshoot and now followed by THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES (longtime Doctor Who-philes will recall investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, a popular companion to the 3rd and 4th Doctor). As a fan, I say keep it coming. To the curious out there who somehow haven't yet turned on to a good thing: c'mon, get hip to TORCHWOOD.",5,"""That is so Welsh.

1104405,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B000VWE5OY,Howard M. Kindel,"[5, 9]","I have to refrain from saying Torchwood is light years ahead of Doctor Who - partly because it probably isn't but mainly because it's too different to even compare the two.  Where Doctor Who (at least at its best) keeps you on the edge of your seat from the excitement, Torchwood keeps you rivited to your TV from the intensity.  Yes, Torchwood is far more ""adult"" oriented; and far less alien ""monster"" oriented.  But to me the main difference is the level of intensity.  And this intensity proceeds not just from the nature of the relationships between the characters - who are definitely not the typical one-dimensional sci-fi characters - but from the uncertainly of each episode's resolution.  I've watched all of Season 1 and a few of Season 2, and, so far,  each episode has had an unexpected turn of events at the ending.  This show, unlike Doctor Who, does not have ""happy endings.""  You always know, with Doctor Who, that  all will be made right again with the world; not so with Torchwood.  Yes, the alien entity is effectively dealt with; but there's no sense of relief.  All is not right with the world again. The resolution leaves as much loss as gain in its wake - if not more so. This was no more true than with the 2-part Season 1 finale.  Part 1 was absolutely magnificent, in every respect - as great a show as I've ever seen; Part 2, though, was a great let-down - because when the alien entity finally made its appearance, it was entirely anti-climactic, and the resolution unsatisfactory in that it wasn't really worthy of what went before it.  The loss was far greater than the gain.  It's unusual enough to see any Sci-Fi show which doesn't have a happy ending that restores everything to the way it was before anything happened; but to see one that never has a happy ending is nothing short of amazing - particularly amazing because we're conditioned to believe that saving the world from the ""bad guy"" is such a good thing that it makes everything  alright again.  But everything's not alright just because the world's been saved.  What's lost is lost and gone forever.

Then, everything settled down and the show took a wonderful turn for the better and established a reasonably unique identity they can be proud of that is more Alfred Hitchcock meets The Twilight Zone in nature than the comic strip sci-fi of Dr. Who.By the 9th show of the season Torchwood took off on a sprint.  They tossed off any likeness to US produced shows like &#34;Fringe&#34; or &#34;The X-Files&#34; and embraced the odd, sci-fi human drama that I remember from the black and white TV days of the Twilight Zone where Burgess Merideth played the last man on earth, finally having all the time in the world to read any book he wanted...before he broke his glasses and could not read with out them. I'd say that they were more like Alfred Hitchcock Presents except with a returning cast, setting and characters.I would not say that these shows are &#34;like&#34; the twilight zone&#34; only that, in the same way that the &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; could air an episode one week that is more Action Adventure and Science Fantasy (as John Wyndham of Triffods Fame might call it), the next week the show would be a dark, quirky human story about how &#34;one should be careful about what one wishes for.&#34;  This isn't slip shod and peace meal either, as one might think from what I've said so far.  Like most modern suspence/thriller/sci-fi shows, there is a multi-layered plot at work keeping the entire plot organized and effecitve and various sub-plots to work out that keep things interesting that last for 2-3 episodes before working themselves out in an entertaining and interesting way.This is GOOD STUFF.And when it gets to episodes 8, 9 and 10, make sure you bring a box of tissues.

Serving as mankind's line of defense against the paranormal -- be it ghosts, aliens, or technology run amok -- they've got their hands full when Cardiff policewoman Gwen Cooper discovers the group resurrecting a dead man in order to question him about his (otherworldly) killer.Eventually joining the group, Cooper slowly comes to realize that being a part of such a secretive agency has its drawbacks -- especially the fact that she has to hide her job from her boyfriend, Rhys.Joining her are Toshiko Sato, a computer expert, as well as fellow agent Owen Harper and ""support man"" Ianto Jones. They're an interesting and rather complicated bunch, each bringing their own personal demons to the table.Part of the brilliance of ""Torchwood"" is that we the audience care as much about the characters as we do the plights they face. Considering they face everything from killer fairies, country-dwelling cannibals and even rips in the fabric of time that threaten to destroy the world, that's really saying something!Of course, one couldn't review ""Torchwood"" without mentioning its charismatic lead, John Barrowman. Truly an actor's actor, he delivers fine performances as Jack Harkness, blending the perfect mix of bravado and vulnerability, making him more than just an action-hero or a dashing  prime-time star.While some of the episodes are of the ""monster-of-the-week"" variety (one of the series' few weaknesses) we begin to build some continuity towards the end. There are too many standout episodes to name -- an uncommon trait in most American television. Sexy, scary and often quite riveting,  I'm at my wits end now that season two has begun and I *do not* receive BBC America.Needless to say, the BBC has outdone themselves in terms of quality. Presented in the 1.85 aspect ratio and enhanced for wide-screen displays, the picture quality is excellent. Audio is equally as good, and there are so many extras that are you'll be playing these discs long after you finish watching all twelve episodes.So for those of you haven't seen this show, what are you waiting for? ""Torchwood"" is one of the finest series since ""The X-Files"" or ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".

Dr. Who was awesome to such a point where I was interested in even the ancillary shows, so I viewed Torchwood, hoping for more.  No luck.  What really makes Dr. Who great is the acting and characterization of the Doctor himself.  Torchwood has nothing like him.  It's budget is low, the Weevils are silly, and the relationships are a mess.The relationships, let me go into them more.  If male/male and female/female is your thing, you'll love Torchwood.

A couple episodes which didn't concentrate on the main cast like 'Random Shoes' and 'Small Worlds' were really good.  They carry the show up to three stars for me.Probably the biggest dislike I had for the show was how Captain Jack Harkness reacted to his subordinates.  They don't follow his orders.  They don't listen to him.  He's 'in charge' only during the tense chases when they have a clearly defined enemy.  As soon as a decision comes along which doesn't have immediate consequences, they ignore his orders.

1104438,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B000VWE5OY,Kevin J. Loria,"[213, 238]","Torchwood is the most-times dark, sometimes gory, adult tie-in to the new Doctor Who series, but that hardly matters as it is the most unique TV you'll ever see. ..Dr. Who producer & two-time Hugo-nominated writer Russell T. Davies created the series as an opportunity to do more than just family fare, part CSI, part X-files and the remaining part is out there on its own.  In Dr. Who there have been hidden references to the ""secret"" organization TORCHWOOD (the name which is an anagram of DOCTOR WHO) since season one (an answer given by the ANNE DROID in BAD WOLF episode 12 ), then appearing more physically throughout season two, even featuring the origin of the organization created by  Queen Victorian herself to defend the Earth from alien threats, including The Doctor.  The series takes place over a hundred years later as Jack says on the promos, ""In the 21st century, everything changes."" Captain Jack Harkness (played BRILLIANTLY by the dashing John Barrowman, best known to Americans as the singing Nazi lead in the ""Springtime for Hitler"" number in the Producers musical) is a character introduced during season one of Dr. Who, an ex-time agent, con-man, the Doctor & Rose meet in the 1940's and turn towards the path of good and righteousness, well almost.Jack is originally from the 51st century, which is intended to explain his oversexed ways (i.e. he is very liberal in who he ""SNOGS""& ""SHAGS"" ) His background is really complex, even before he meets the Doctor, but he is missing some of his memories from his time as a time-agent, during the ""Parting of the Ways"" the first season finale of Dr. Who his character becomes even more interesting, but I won't say more without spoiler warnings.I know I've referenced Dr. Who, a lot, but WATCHING DR. WHO IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR ENJOYING TORCHWOOD, MERELY A BONUS. There is a level to Torchwood that is directed at DW fans, but it isn't obtrusive.  The initial season of Torchwood begins introducing the viewer to its world through the eyes of Gwen, a low-rung Cardiff lady cop, eventually becomes part of a jaded almost amoral group that uses scavenged alien-tech to protect the world from future threats. The neophyte member eventually serves as catalysis to re-humanize the team. But the dynamic of the characters is one of abrasiveness, deceit, love and lust. The major players are far from perfect, by the end of the season, most of the team have done things both unexpected and at times alarming.Most of the performances are great to watch, much Americanized, gritty acting. Gwen, played by Eve Myles, who oddly enough played a Victorian servant girl named Gwyneth who opens the closes the very rift Torchwood is build on in Dr. Who season 1. Gwen is an earthy attractive but not unrealistically so, as are most of the players, except Jack, of course, who is over-the-top silver-screen good looking, which is perfect for his over-the-top fearless-leader-with-a-mysterious-past archetype.Torchwood is very stylish, lots of aerial shots of building in Cardiff, the Welsh city where the series is filmed and most of the action takes place.  Its waterside features remind me of New Orleans.  Another anchor location of the show in Cardiff is soooo appropriately the Roald Dahl Plaza (Carciff-born creator of Willy Wonka) it would naturally hold a time-space rift and the headquarters of a secret organization under the fountain where it can monitor extra-terrestrial traffic through the rift. Kind of a sexed up Men in Black, except no one wears black,  well ok Iantos does, but he's more of a case manager type. The series music co-composed by Dr. Who's Murray Gold is both edgy and original. As is the special effects and make-up. In the pilot episode, the make-up on the Weevil, a reoccurring species, is so good that a long scene is shot in full-light with Gwen and another character studying the creature. That is how confident and bold the makers of Torchwood are! The series won a BEST DRAMA SERIES BAFTA (the British Academy of Film and Television Arts), besting Doctor Who season 2 in the category and  first episodes gave BBC 3 its highest ratings ever.  One series flaw is that Torchwood is meant to be very covert, but they also seem to be high profile ""special ops,"" other than that amusing conflict, I love the series and think that many Americans who may have never watched any British TV before, will be hooked!The episode guide that follows may have some MINOR SPOILERS, okay?#1 ""Everything Changes""This is a good one, I give it 9 out of 10,  it is one of the best series pilots I've seen. Unlike some series openers, it seems familiar with characters and where they are going, there's no early season one awkwardness here,  INFACT, Eve Myles WON a ""BEST-ACTRESS"" BAFTA (Wales) for this one, John Barrowman got a nom...Episode Synopsis:South Wales coffee makin' cop Gwen Cooper is at the scene of a murder when Torchwood shows,  Gwen snoops on the group and sees in a disturbing scene in which the victim is temporally resurrected, then  questioned. She starts her own investigation to learn more, and ends up meeting an alien and literally going underground unsuccessfully disguised as a pizza-girl, joins up and then things get weird....#2 Day OneThis one is less good, but is all about the fact that Torchwood is an adult series and begins to set some boundaries. Even so, this one has a great pre-titles scene with Gwen & her boyfriend, and a great opening line...7 out of 10 for this one...Episode Synopsis:The title says it all...it is Gwen's first day on the job, and because of her obligatory noob screw up she unwittingly unleashes a hot-sex-addicted-alien....no REALLY...this  one is about AN ALIEN WHO SHAGS HER WAY THROUGH THE EPISODE...it seems like a Captain Jack natural. There are some great moments and some great lude dialogue, like following the discovery of the alien's nature and the disintegrated remains of its first partner, Harkness remarks that the guy ""came and went, at the same time."" More lines like that and hot-girl-on-alien action...#3 Ghost MachineThis one is spooky and provides some insights into the gruff team member Owen's character.  Usually, so far, Owen, played by Burn Gorman, isn't the sort to get involved or outwardly show his real feelings, in the series thus far, he has deflected them and given Gwen and the others attitude to cover.  This time, due to his unique interaction with the machine, he is very open and driven.... 8 out of 10 for this one...Episode Synopsis:The team retrieve an alien artifact that shows ghost images of the past, thus allowing Owen to witnesses a girl's murder some forty years before. He becomes obsessed with bring the murderer to justice, while Gwen tries to stop future projections from occurring as well.#4 CyberwomanThis one may be too much for the Dr. Who fans, but you need not know the back-story to appreciate the story, but it helps to forgive the nature of the story that seems awkward when compared to the rest of the season. The Cybermen, humans converted from a parallel Earth, were all meant to be destroyed at another Torchwood base on this Earth, this is the exception. This time a half converted erotic-cyborg with more gruesome conversion effects and other creepiness, oh and Cyberwoman vs. the pterodactyl...did I mention they have a pterodactyl in the Torchwood HQ...7.5 out of 10 for this one...Episode Synopsis:Ianto, played by Gareth David-Lloyd who is sort of the teams Alfred the Butler, managing the Batcave,  has hidden what's left of his girlfriend  at Torchwood. His plans to get outside help end with the entire team at risk of finding themselves converted or worse!#5 Small WorldsThis one is creepy, if a little predictable, take something inherently cute and friendly, like say fairies, and make them dangerous, powerful and a little homicidal, throw in a spooky little girl, an old girl friend of Jack's er... Dad...and you have a winning mix,  8.5 out of 10 for this one....Episode Synopsis:Jack's senior friend has discovered fairies in a nearby wood, while Torchwood uncovers a mysterious jail death and weird weather bursts. Jack sees a pattern connected to his mysterious past....#6 CountrycideThis one is grisly, edgy and very frightening, playing-out like a mainstream horror movie, a good one!  This one isn't for the squeamish.  ...9 out of 10 for Countrycide...Episode Synopsis:Deaths in the middle of nowhere split up the team, Gwen and Owen find themselves in another tight situation, a survivor hides from the killer, Tech-chick Tosh and Ianto race against the clock, and the team fight to stay off the menu.#7 Greeks Bearing GiftsThis one isn't the best of the season, but it does give more development to Tosh's character...6.5 out of 10...Episode Synopsis:Tosh gets a strange pendant from a strange woman and she gains the strange ability to read  minds. In the process learning way more than just casual thoughts, in order to make things right Tosh must get this woman into Torchwood H.Q.#8 They keep killing SuzieThis is a great one...disturbing and well written, a fallen Torchwood member returns providing a unique opportunity to deal with the consequences of events in the pilot episode. A great exploration of Gwen and her place in Torchwood... I give it 9.5 out of 10...Episode Synopsis:The ""Resurrection-Gauntlet"" was classified as too dangerous to continue experimenting with, but a link to pre-pilot events, force the team to use the gauntlet on a deceased Torchwood member. The process goes wrong  and events go from bad to worse#9 Random ShoesAnother surprisingly good story, most of the regular team is sideline for much of this one as it's point of view is from a deceased peripheral character, like Dr. Who's B team stories (used for shooting two shows simultaneously ), it brilliantly features an outsider's view of the team, more outside than even Gwen's episode one intro...9 out of 10...the end is a bit sappy...Episode Synopsis:Eugene Jones learns that he has been the victim of a hit-and-run and is dead. He retracing his ""steps""  leading up to his death, including his interaction with the Torchwood team and what he believed was an alien artifact,  while Gwen is the unwitting partner in the same investigation.#10 Out of TimeThis one is a weak one, ""the fish out of water/ romance that can never be,""  great pre-title opening with the Team on hand as a temporally -displaced plane touches down on an airstrip, mostly-predictable and unnecessarily sappy...7 out of 10...Episode Synopsis:Three stangers from the early 50's are trapped in present-day Cardiff, after flying from the Rift. Torchwood helps each of the them deal with making a new life, one way or another and Owen gets serious with one.#11 CombatThis one is written by Noel Clarke a.k.a Mickey Smith, really.  You've asked for it, you got it! The Weevil Fight Club!  This one is pretty good, what it lacks in originality it makes up for in style and intensity...9 out of 10...Episode Synopsis:Weevils continue to come from the rift surfacing across Cardiff, but where are they disappearing to? Owen goes undercover to find out.#12 Captain Jack HarknessWarning this one is not for the homophobic; Jack is particularly randy in this one. There's loads of drama and amazing acting in this one,  although a visually limited view of the WWII era, the character of Bilis Manger, mysterious time-walker, is fascinating to watch as he manipulates the staff in this episode and the next, played by Murray Melvin (who could play William Hartnell if they every need him). .. 9.5 out of 10Episode Synopsis:Jack and Tosh are transported to the 1940s, during the Blitz where they meet another Captain Jack Harkness and it isn't Jack. The rest of the team go in search of decades old clues Jack and Tosh may have left.( Watch for the ""Vote Saxon"" posters in this one. A Dr. Who series 3 ref.)#13 End of DaysTightly following the events in the last episode, all hell breaks loose, literally as the mysterious Mr. Bilis plans for the Rift continue with it wide enough to release the deity he worships. This one has its roots in H.P. Lovecraft's work, ...10 out of 10...Episode Synopsis:People from thoughout history come through the rift into the present across the world.  Jack learns he is the only thing standing between the world and the ""Son the Beast"". Jack is put in a position where he may have to sacrifice it all to save everyone. (This one connects directly to the final 3 episodes of Dr. Who season 3.)Check out the Deadringer's spoof of the series on YOUTube.And BBC America showing Series TWO in January, it has had such a good

1104439,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000VWE5OY,Kevin Killian,"[1, 5]","Too often an episode of Torchwood reaches its climax with Captain Jack standing in a column of irradiated light, his handsome features contorted in pain, screaming either, ""&Ouml;pen the Rift!"" or ""Close the Rift!""  Since we never did figure out what the Rift was nor why it should be either opened or closed, we haven't yet come close to the ideal experience of Torchwood which, on the face of it, should be one of our very favorite shows.It has, seemingly, everything, an unusual location, a provocative theme, some passable acting, a good looking cast, and that Doctor Who pedigree.  And how many shows use anagrams in their title, so that's cool!  And yet whenever it begins, I get distracted, looking at Owen's unappealingly foxy face; the little twerp is supposed to be the sexyboy on the show, but to me he looks like a pocket version of the late Don Knotts.  Then there's Eve Myles, gorgeous and gaptoothed as Gwen.  In Season One she quits her job on the regular police force to join up with Torchwood, the secret branch.  Either they present some episodes out of order on the DVD, or Gwen forgets she's married whenever it's convenient for the writers (if she's not married to the guy at home, forgive me for not understanding the Welsh).Torchwood's mission, to repel aliens, seems boring after a bit.  And xenophobic and nationalistic.  Why are the aliens uniformly presented as unattractive, in fact evil freaks?  Is this how outsiders are welcomed in Cardiff?  Then excuse me if I stay home, despite the way the city skyline and marina have been photoshopped to picture postcard perfection for the filming.  As for Ianto or whatever his name is, on any other show he'd be an extra; here requiring him to memorize and say lines smacks of exploitation.Still we're sort of hooked and have started Season Two with hopes still high.",3,Leeks and Daffodils,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,1840,"['Too', 'often', 'episode', 'Torchwood', 'climax', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'standing', 'column', 'irradiated', 'light', 'handsome', 'features', 'contorted', 'pain', 'screaming', 'either', 'Ouml', 'pen', 'Rift', 'Close', 'Rift', 'never', 'did', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Rift', 'was', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'opened', 'closed', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'come', 'close', 'ideal', 'experience', 'Torchwood', 'face', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'shows.It', 'seemingly', 'everything', 'unusual', 'location', 'provocative', 'theme', 'passable', 'acting', 'good', 'looking', 'cast', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'pedigree', 'how', 'many', 'shows', 'use', 'anagrams', 'title', 'cool', 'yet', 'whenever', 'get', 'distracted', 'looking', 'Owen', 'unappealingly', 'foxy', 'face', 'little', 'twerp', 'supposed', 'be', 'sexyboy', 'show', 'pocket', 'version', 'late', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Then', 'Eve', 'Myles', 'gorgeous', 'gaptoothed', 'Gwen', 'Season', 'One', 'job', 'regular', 'police', 'force', 'join', 'up', 'Torchwood', 'secret', 'branch', 'present', 'episodes', 'order', 'DVD', 'Gwen', 'married', 'convenient', 'writers', 'not', 'married', 'guy', 'home', 'forgive', 'not', 'understanding', 'Welsh', '.Torchwood', 'mission', 'repel', 'aliens', 'boring', 'bit', 'xenophobic', 'nationalistic', 'Why', 'are', 'aliens', 'uniformly', 'presented', 'unattractive', 'fact', 'freaks', 'how', 'outsiders', 'are', 'welcomed', 'Cardiff', 'Then', 'stay', 'home', 'way', 'city', 'skyline', 'marina', 'have', 'been', 'photoshopped', 'picture', 'postcard', 'perfection', 'filming', 'Ianto', 'whatever', 'name', 'other', 'show', ""'d"", 'be', 'extra', 'here', 'requiring', 'memorize', 'say', 'lines', 'smacks', 'exploitation.Still', ""'re"", 'sort', 'hooked', 'have', 'started', 'Season', 'Two', 'hopes', 'still', 'high']",Torchwood: Season 1
1104440,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000VWE5OY,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[19, 23]","""Torchwood,"" a spin-off of the revived ""Doctor Who"" series, is a strange bird.  It can be one of the greatest shows around and then tank miserably.  The show centers around the Torchwood Institute's Cardiff operation, headed up by the dashingly handsome (and quite possibly immortal) Captain Jack Harkness (played with excellent flair by John Barrowman).  He leads a small ragtag group of scientists, specialists, etc. who set out to protect the world from bizarre aliens and other creatures that make their way to our home planet via a rift in time and space.  Some of the visitors are good, but the bad ones get the attention.  The team includes Tosh (Naoko Mori), a shy computer specialist who longs for Owen (Burn Gorman), the cocky and not-all-too-likeable team doctor.  Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) is the quiet and always reliable clean-up man who is basically a butler in the same vein as Batman's Alfred (although much younger).  The team is rounded out by Suzie and eventual team newbie, Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), who adds heart to the team.Fans of the new ""Doctor Who"" will recognize Captain Jack.  He's still the dashing and cocky hero that the Doctor and Rose met, but throughout the season his character becomes more mysterious and, at times, morbidly dark and heartless.  He is the glue that holds this show together.What ""Who"" fans might not recognize is the heavy adult tone of ""Torchwood.""  The language, violence and sexual content go way beyond family-friendly.  This helps and hinders the show at the same time.  The language is about as bad as a PG-13 movie for the most part, but a few scenes get (necessarily) R-rated.  The violence is also essential for the most part, but the action can be too much for younger viewers.  I felt like much of the sexual content was thrown in just because it could be.  I have no problem with this sort of content but I do believe it should be used only when it adds to the story.  In ""Day One,"" a sex-crazed alien that survives off of orgasms (yes, I said orgasms), makes for an interesting and hilarious story.  While some may not like seeing homosexual content, the episode ""Captain Jack Harkness"" uses just that develop the character of Harkness even more.  In other episodes, there are brief encounters that really needn't be there.The series has some excellent episodes, such as ""Small Worlds,"" a downright creepy thriller involving the activity of fairies in our world.  Another bright spot is ""Random Shoes,"" told from the viewpoint of a dead man following the Torchwood team as they investigate his death.  It's funny, interesting and even touching at times.  The top of the heap as far as series one goes, though, is ""Countrycide.""  The team visits a rural town where the body count skyrockets in cycles.  Who or what is killling off these people?  The answer will shock you.Of course, for all that is great about this series, there are a few clunkers that almost turned me off to the show entirely.  First was ""Cyberwoman,"" which showcases a relationship of my favorite Torchwood member, Ianto.  He's keeping his semi-Cyber girlfriend hidden in the bowels of Torchwood hoping to find help for her.  The Cybermen are my favorite classic ""Who"" villains, but even I have to say that Ianto's Cyber-girlfriend was too hokey to digest.  The ending almost saves the episode, but it's the biggest downfall of the series so far.  Secondly is ""Combat,"" which features a very interesting fight club that is used to develop Owen's character a bit more.  Unfortunately, it all falls flat in the end.  Also, a couple of episodes, ""Greeks Bearing Gifts"" and ""Out of Time,"" are mediocre at best.The DVD release is very good, with excellent extras including ""Torchwood Declassified"" and extensive looks into each character and special effects.So, you take the good with the bad and you end up with a new series that has wonderful highs and horrible lows.  I would recommend this series as a purchase since there are more pros than cons, but do not let your chidren watch this until they are much older.  I understand that many ""Who"" fans were completely turned off by the series' abrasive ways, but it's okay with me.  Remember, this isn't ""Doctor Who,"" it's a whole new animal.",4,Up And Down The Rift,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,4226,"['Torchwood', 'spin-off', 'revived', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'strange', 'bird', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'then', 'tank', 'miserably', 'show', 'Torchwood', 'Institute', 'Cardiff', 'operation', 'headed', 'up', 'dashingly', 'handsome', 'quite', 'possibly', 'immortal', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'played', 'excellent', 'flair', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'small', 'ragtag', 'group', 'scientists', 'specialists', 'etc', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'protect', 'world', 'bizarre', 'aliens', 'other', 'creatures', 'make', 'way', 'home', 'planet', 'rift', 'time', 'space', 'visitors', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'ones', 'get', 'attention', 'team', 'Tosh', 'Naoko', 'Mori', 'shy', 'computer', 'specialist', 'who', 'Owen', 'Burn', 'Gorman', 'cocky', 'not-all-too-likeable', 'team', 'doctor', 'Ianto', 'Gareth', 'David-Lloyd', 'quiet', 'always', 'reliable', 'clean-up', 'man', 'who', 'basically', 'butler', 'same', 'vein', 'Batman', 'Alfred', 'much', 'younger', 'team', 'rounded', 'out', 'Suzie', 'eventual', 'team', 'newbie', 'Gwen', 'Cooper', 'Eve', 'Myles', 'who', 'heart', 'team.Fans', 'new', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'will', 'recognize', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'still', 'dashing', 'cocky', 'hero', 'Doctor', 'Rose', 'met', 'season', 'character', 'more', 'mysterious', 'times', 'morbidly', 'dark', 'heartless', 'glue', 'show', 'Who', 'fans', 'might', 'not', 'recognize', 'heavy', 'adult', 'tone', 'Torchwood', 'language', 'violence', 'sexual', 'content', 'go', 'way', 'family-friendly', 'show', 'same', 'time', 'language', 'about', 'as', 'bad', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'few', 'scenes', 'get', 'necessarily', 'R-rated', 'violence', 'also', 'essential', 'most', 'part', 'action', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'younger', 'viewers', 'felt', 'much', 'sexual', 'content', 'was', 'thrown', 'just', 'could', 'be', 'have', 'problem', 'sort', 'content', 'do', 'believe', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'only', 'when', 'story', 'Day', 'One', 'sex-crazed', 'alien', 'orgasms', 'yes', 'said', 'orgasms', 'interesting', 'hilarious', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'seeing', 'homosexual', 'content', 'episode', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'just', 'character', 'Harkness', 'even', 'more', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'brief', 'encounters', 'really', 'need', ""n't"", 'be', 'there.The', 'series', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'such', 'Small', 'Worlds', 'downright', 'creepy', 'thriller', 'involving', 'activity', 'fairies', 'world', 'bright', 'spot', 'Random', 'Shoes', 'told', 'viewpoint', 'dead', 'man', 'following', 'Torchwood', 'team', 'investigate', 'death', 'funny', 'interesting', 'even', 'touching', 'times', 'top', 'heap', 'as', 'far', 'series', 'one', 'though', 'Countrycide', 'team', 'rural', 'town', 'where', 'body', 'count', 'skyrockets', 'cycles', 'Who', 'what', 'killling', 'off', 'people', 'answer', 'will', 'shock', 'you.Of', 'course', 'great', 'series', 'are', 'few', 'clunkers', 'almost', 'turned', 'show', 'entirely', 'First', 'was', 'Cyberwoman', 'relationship', 'favorite', 'Torchwood', 'member', 'Ianto', 'keeping', 'semi-Cyber', 'girlfriend', 'hidden', 'bowels', 'Torchwood', 'hoping', 'find', 'help', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'favorite', 'classic', 'Who', 'villains', 'even', 'have', 'say', 'Ianto', 'Cyber-girlfriend', 'was', 'too', 'hokey', 'digest', 'ending', 'almost', 'episode', 'biggest', 'downfall', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'Secondly', 'Combat', 'very', 'interesting', 'fight', 'club', 'used', 'develop', 'Owen', 'character', 'bit', 'more', 'Unfortunately', 'flat', 'end', 'Also', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Greeks', 'Bearing', 'Gifts', 'Time', 'are', 'mediocre', 'best.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'very', 'good', 'excellent', 'extras', 'including', 'Torchwood', 'Declassified', 'extensive', 'looks', 'character', 'special', 'effects.So', 'take', 'good', 'bad', 'end', 'up', 'new', 'series', 'wonderful', 'highs', 'horrible', 'lows', 'would', 'recommend', 'series', 'purchase', 'are', 'more', 'pros', 'cons', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'chidren', 'watch', 'are', 'much', 'older', 'understand', 'many', 'Who', 'fans', 'were', 'completely', 'turned', 'off', 'series', 'abrasive', 'ways', 'okay', 'Remember', ""n't"", 'Doctor', 'Who', 'whole', 'new', 'animal']",Torchwood: Season 1

I had heard of the show before, but never gave it much thought.  I've always been a fan of the X-Files and CSI, which this show is somewhat similar to, but I just never really watched it.  I'm glad I decided to give the first episode a try...I was hooked from the start.What I especially love is the writing and the acting.  Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper is great.  She is probably the heart of the show.  Sure, John Barrowman is the lead character, but Eve somehow just gives the show heart.  Don't get me wrong; John is incredible in his role as Captain Jack.  I never saw the show Dr. Who, so I can't really compare him to what he was like on that show.  I think that the episode that stands out for me is ""The Keep Killing Susie"".  I loved the twists and turns in that episode; just when you think she (Susie) is dead...she's not and we have no idea why until the final 20 minutes or so of the episode.Torchwood is definitely a darker drama/action/sci-fi and every now and then humorous show.  I just hope I am able to watch the fourth season in some way.  It's going to air on a channel that I do not get and hopefully BBC America will still be able to pick it up (or it'll maybe be available on Amazon Instant Video...???).

1104454,A33775AIB1A664,B000VWE5OY,"Mark Colan ""duke-of-url""","[1, 1]","Torchwood is a team centered on its leader, a mysterious man with an unusually long history given his apparent age, and the team he has assembled to manage aliens and deal with apparently supernatural events, some but not all related to a rift in the time-space continuum, which just happens to be located in Cardiff, Wales.  Some sci fi, some fantasy themes, and some truly original ideas.There is a LOT of variety in the episodes.  Part of this is that they use a variety of writers who have different ideas, but I wonder if perhaps they were instructed to NOT try to make this look like it was all the same writer.  The characters are developed across all episodes and they still make sense with these differing plot lines, but the subject, mood, and purpose of the episodes vary wildly.Sex plays a role in some of the stories.  It is never very graphic or revealing, but it certainly is not restricted to heterosexuality.  Indeed, the team leader is openly gay, and there is a very romantic story about him and a lover that never quite was, in his distant past.  If it would disturb you to see a romantic or lusty kiss shared between two people of various gender combinations and orientations, this show isn't for you.  I thought it was very nicely done.On finishing the first season, we decided to go through the various show recaps, which give background about each episode, including details on how they created the visual effects.  I would not call them ""special effects"" in that there is not a lot of computer-rendered animation, rather they show how, for example, a man is hit by a car and goes flying over it.  It is very convincing, and it is interesting and educational to see how they did it by filming various parts and then edited them together carefully.  Although I enjoyed watching the episodes, the recap deepened my appreciation for both the stories and production, based on what the cast and creators had to say about them.I love listening to the characters speaking the local dialect and with the local accent.  There are phrases and expressions that use English words that are outside of my understanding, thus something to learn.  The downside is that at times I miss what they are saying.  This problem is solved by turning on subtitles, something we do for shows where the local accent sometimes overwhelms understanding (The Wire is another example).  But having the words up makes it easier to learn from the way they talk.Overall it is a very good series, and we're enjoying it a lot (now in Season 2).  It makes up for its flaws with truly creative ideas and acting.  It is not destined to find its place among my all-time favorites, but it is very entertaining and well worth watching, though quite variable.MINOR SPOILERTorchwood is an anagram of a famous and long-running BBC serial in which the central figure of Torchwood was first introduced.  I have not seen the episodes from the earlier show, but my sense is that his history is consistent with what is in Torchwood.

This Doctor Who spin-off (watching Doctor Who beforehand is not required) concerns a semi-secret (all the locals know they exist, but not what they do) organization called Torchwood, whose mission is to defend Earth against alien invasion.  There's a time-space rift in Cardiff, Wales, so most of the action is based in that area.  The team is led by Captain Jack Harkness (apparently all of this first season takes place before Jack first meets the Doctor.)  We're introduced to Torchwood via Gwen Cooper, a cop, who is recruited into the team in the first episode.  Rounding out the team are Owen, who performs the autopsies, Toshiko (""Tosh""), hacker and gadget girl, and Ianto, who's a... ""tea boy""?There's apparently a contingent of Ianto fans.

Everything about it is disappointing: the writing, characterisation, continuity, acting, directing, editing, music, sound editing, lighting, and special effects. Perhaps the producers were too ambitious for their budget, or perhaps they felt they could rely on the cheap-and-cheerful plastic rocks and rubber monsters that populate early Star Trek and most of the Dr Who series and not bother with essentials like writers.Everything is wrong with this series, so I shall only discuss the writing.The characters are inconsistent, irresponsible, shallow, immature and stupid.  Their dialogue is often stilted and inane; there were only a few moments in the entire series when a line stood out as being at all insightful or witty.The relationships between the characters are also shallow and unappealing, and the focus is, as many reviewers here have stated, mostly crude sexual opportunism.  I have nothing against depicting sexual relationships on tv, but the immediate rush of first kisses is not the interesting part. But that's all we get in Torchwood; the writers don't bother to explore the relationships in depth, to develop compatibility or explore the consequences of infidelity and rejection, or bother to maintain a credible emotional arc.The stories are just a loop of plot devices, emotional wallowing, long harangues declaimed most theatrically, and silent movie era over-acting.",1,Awful.

How did the original Torchwood team ever get together to begin with?! They don't respect their boss Jack, they don't work well together, they, to a person (except Jack), are out for themselves and do the most STUPID things imaginable for a group that supposedly are professionals and have dealt with aliens and alien technology for at least some time. Gwen, at least, has an excuse for being stupid - she's new and she can get away with it for a few episodes, but neither she, nor any team member have ANY growth or maturity over the entire first season. Almost every problem situation they bring on themselves for being plainly reckless and stupid. The potential for a terrific series is there, but the writing rarely lifts the show beyond marginal sci-fi. If the writers think that because this is a BBC show shown and advertised as 'adult', that by making almost every cast member omni-sexual, adding colorful language and bedroom scenes that this could possibly lift the drama out of the quagmire of painful writing and ridiculous story lines - they are SO mistaken. It's too bad, I actually like the cast, the show looks great in HD, the Torchwood set and locations are nice, the directing is good - but the writing cripples what should be an enjoyable earth-bound sci-fi show. Let's see if season two can redeem the show. If you want to see the show at its best in season one, check out Countrycide and Random Shoes.

It was well-played and put together nicely... just the right amount of ""cheesiness"" and humor. Good. I liked it. Series 2 of Dr.Who with the cast changes was not as good in my opinion, but whatever.. My point is.. when Captain Jack's character came along, it was a nice addition.

So I was excited for Torchwood and finally downloaded the season (1)  the other day.I gotta say.. everyone does a great job with the acting, aside from Captain Jack. (John Barrowman) He just seems to be WAY over-doing every line and action. It really makes it a task to watch, becuase his cast-mates are doing a fine job. I guess I just expected more.

1104495,AIJ0DEHA822CS,B000VWE5OY,"Ricky Pooski ""cool""","[14, 18]","WhenDoctor Who - The Complete First Seriesintroduced Jack, he was charming and fun. He flirted with everyone and had a great time doing it. Of course, they were going to make a spinoff.And then the spinoff came and it turned Jack into a dull school marm in a classroom full of bland creeps. The first four episodes are pretty good but eventually it becames too apparent that Gwen, a miserable Mary Sue character, is going to be the center of the show. And she's awful. She has to always be on some kind of sermonizing moral trip. When she ""accidentally"" kills someone (who by the plotline fully deserves it) she gets weepy. When she is in a situation where it's kill or be killed - she decides to drop her gun and wait for Jack to rescue her.And then halfway through the season the show decides to explore the rest of the cast. And they are even more boring. Tosh is sad. Owen is a jerk. Ianto has a sexy cyberwoman girlfriend. He's been hiding her in the Torchwood basement for over a year and somehow no one has noticed.Even more fun, RTD just hits us over the head with his two sermons - pacifism and atheism. The former is typically hypocritical since he can't seem to write a character that might NOT deserve death to save his life. The latter is just irritating. How many characters can die and come back to life and go ""There's NOTHING out there""?? Got it. The only difference between this series andLeft Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days (Left Behind No. 1)is that I EXPECT to be preached at with Left Behind. With this show I expect entertainment.And then just as things can't get any worse, Gwen admits to having an affair (everyone is having sex with each other on this show) and then knocks her boyfriend out with Space Roofies (yes, I know the name is Retcon, but I'm calling them space roofies) and DEMANDS that he forgives her. He doesn't. But that doesn't stop this narcissist idiot from yelling at him. At this is when I realized that I was watchingGrey's Anatomy - The Complete Third Season.Stupid. Boring. Obnoxious.

1104497,A4FX5YCJA630V,B000VWE5OY,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[8, 9]","This is a review with a bit of a difference considering I've never watched a single episode of Doctor Who in my life (I'll get to it eventually), despite knowing that ""Torchwood"" is a spin-off of that entertainment juggernaut, and in fact derives its name from an anagram of its mother show. But I'd been told that knowledge of the prior show was not strictly necessary, and thought perhaps I'd be able to watch with fresh eyes and without inevitably drawing comparisons with the original show.Gwen Cooper is a young police officer who happens to be present when a crime scene is interrupted by a mysterious group of people who are offhandedly referred to as Torchwood by her colleges. She watches in astonishment from a nearby car-park building as the team use a gauntlet to temporarily resurrect the murder victim, and begins her own private investigation into discovering who exactly these people are.Turns out that Torchwood is a secret organization ""outside the government, beyond the police"" which is led by the enigmatic, charismatic, long coat-wearing Captain Jack Harkness, who is intrigued by Gwen's disapproving point of view on their activities. After being introduced to the rest of the team: Doctor Owen Harper, computer genius Toshiko Sato, faithful butler Ianto Jones, and second-in-command Suzie Costello; Gwen learns that there's a rift in space and time over Cardiff, resulting in an influx of aliens, time-travel and other bizarre occurrences that require a specialized team of experts to deal with. That's where Torchwood comes in.Unexpected tragedy means that a space opens up on the team, and Jack invites Gwen to join in order to infuse some degree of humanity in the business-like dealings of the Torchwood team. She agrees; a decision that will change her life forever. Thirteen episodes in all, the show purports to be a grownup sci-fi show that melds the detective work of CSI with plenty of sex, gore and violence. For the most part the episodes are standalone, with little continuity between them (unless you count the meaningless entanglements that the staff have with each other or with one-shot guest stars), and many of them follow basic sci-fi storylines. There's the one with the parasitic alien, the time-traveling visitors, the alien fight club, the device which reads minds, etc.Yet when the show finds its feet, it suddenly becomes very, very good. Jack Harkness is an intriguing character with a mysterious past and an immunity to death. His agenda suggests that he knows more than he's letting on, whilst simultaneously being just as baffled about his own existence as the rest of his team. The scenes that centre on him and John Barrowman's boisterous, enthusiastic, larger-than-life performances are invariably the scenes worth tuning in for. Other episodes such as ""They Keep Killing Suzie"" have intricate plots, nuanced characterization and themes on the nature of life and the cost of immorality that are truly thought-provoking.To make a long story short, the first season of Torchwood is a mixed bag. There's plenty of potential, and lots of pay-off, but the characterization and general content are often frustrating. For the record, I don't consider three stars a ""bad"" review by any means, but to my mind at least, the biggest detriments of the show are threefold.As mentioned, the show tries to pass itself off as ""adult"" by making it a darker and edgier version of Doctor Who. Here's the rub: the process of making something ""darker and edgier"" has been interpreted as ""adding more sex, profanity and violence."" This does not automatically make a show more adult, in fact it has the opposite effect and can make it seem quite juvenile at times. Despite repeated claims by writers and producers in the DVD extras that their use of sex and violence is not gratuitous, most of the time it *is* gratuitous and serves no real purpose beyond giving the writers the opportunity to point at the screen and say: ""look at how edgy we're being!""Another serious problem is the fact that many of characters simply aren't very likeable: not in the ""flawed but human"" way, but in the ""what a jerk!"" way. Essentially, most of them act like irresponsible and immature children, only with sex drives that they can't seem to keep in check. The drama of the show doesn't derive from characters grappling with moral conundrums or with the weight of the responsibility placed on them, but from their inability to keep their pants on. The relationships they foster are shallow and meaningless, and the audience is given little reason to care about any of them.In particular, the focus of the show keeps coming back to Gwen and Owen. Although Tosh is a cool intellectual and Ianto is a sweetheart, the writers seem to be more interested in making most of the plots revolve around Gwen and Owen; the former an inconsistent character who never seems to do the job that she was hired for, and the latter a complete jerk. Gwen is apparently meant to be the empathetic one, but this usually involves her trusting the wrong people, getting aggravated with her team mates when she feels they're not being compassionate enough, and cheating on her boyfriend.Owen is meant to be a dark, smooth ladies man, except that the actor isn't really handsome or charming enough to pull it off, and in his first appearance he's using an alien aphrodisiac to entice strangers into having sex with him. Wow, just like a sex offender with date-rape pills! Later he makes a rather disgusting proposition to Gwen whilst he has her forcibly pinned against a tree, and by the end of the episode they're sleeping together. Even Jack, ostentatiously the main character, is marginalized in favor of these two.Finally there are also some things that just plain don't make sense. If Torchwood is a secret organization, why do they drive around in a giant SUV with flashing lights and blaring music? Why is this team of ""experts"" so ridiculously incompetent and disorganized? What exactly is it that they do that couldn't be done just as easily by the local police force? If they're above the government, where do they get their funding? (admittedly, the answer to this may lie in Doctor Who, where it was first introduced). Why do they have a pterodactyl flying around their headquarters, and who cleans up after it? Is it just a coincidence that they're all bi-sexual or is it something to do with the rift? (I just think four out of five bi-curious characters are rather unlikely odds).Yet my three-star review does not mean that I think the show is bad - not by any means. The episodes, whatever else their faults, are fast-paced, well acted and built on a solid premise. There is room for much improvement, but the promise is there, and (according to general opinion) is acted upon in the second season.This DVD box set boasts some exceptional extras: along with the usual deleted scenes, outtakes, making of featurettes, and interviews with the cast and crew, it also has a commentary track for every single episode, something I've never seen before (usually they opt for just one or two). There's even a segment in which John Barrowman grabs hold of a microphone and belts out ""Anything Goes"" for a 1930s audience. The enthusiasm and care with which the cast and crew discuss the show is contagious, and it's difficult to really condemn a show that so many people obviously enjoy being a part of. Although I was not hugely impressed by Torchwood's first offering, I'm sufficiently intrigued to give season two a try.",3,"""The 21st Century is When Everything Changes...""",1285027200,"09 21,

After all, they ARE NOT the Doctor, they are humans who for the most part have had little to no exposure to aliens and their technology, and are basically winging it (well, despite Jack) with 21st Century know how- They don't have all the answers like the Doctor, but they carry on their mission to learn more and adapt.It is a reflection of how the earth carries on WITHOUT the Doctor's presence and the learning curve associated with trying to deal with extra terrestrial incursions- really, did Mulder and Scully ever get this much exposure or effect when dealing with aliens? Seems like every time they got close to a close encounter, the plot did not allow for prolonged or even physical contact with their protagonists, and they were usually relegated to staring at the thing as it disappeared.The interpretations that the characters are morally compromised, well, I am sure that everyone of us is so perfect that we can judge other's character.A great series and only getting better, with competent acting, great stories, and the FX is on par with Dr Who (Suprise?).",5,I only bought this because I was running out of Dr Who episodes,1227139200,"11 20, 2008",2008,1406,"['first', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'take', 'series-', 'was', 'darker', 'naughtier', 'grimmier', 'Dr', 'Who', 'uplifting', 'fun', 'David', 'Tennant', 'band-Slightly', 'disappointed', 'opener', 'was', 'not', '2nd', '3rd', 'episode', 'where', 'really', 'started', 'appreciate', 'then', 'love', 'characters', 'premise', 'naivte', 'times', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'Doctor', 'are', 'humans', 'who', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'had', 'little', 'exposure', 'aliens', 'technology', 'are', 'basically', 'winging', 'well', 'Jack', '21st', 'Century', 'know', 'how-', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'answers', 'Doctor', 'carry', 'mission', 'learn', 'more', 'adapt.It', 'reflection', 'how', 'earth', 'Doctor', 'presence', 'learning', 'curve', 'associated', 'trying', 'deal', 'extra', 'terrestrial', 'incursions-', 'really', 'did', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'ever', 'get', 'much', 'exposure', 'effect', 'when', 'dealing', 'aliens', 'Seems', 'time', 'got', 'close', 'close', 'encounter', 'plot', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'prolonged', 'even', 'physical', 'contact', 'protagonists', 'were', 'usually', 'relegated', 'staring', 'thing', 'interpretations', 'characters', 'are', 'morally', 'compromised', 'well', 'am', 'sure', 'everyone', 'so', 'perfect', 'can', 'judge', 'other', 'character.A', 'great', 'series', 'only', 'getting', 'better', 'competent', 'acting', 'great', 'stories', 'FX', 'par', 'Dr', 'Who', 'Suprise']",Torchwood: Season 1

It's unfortunate because the trend ruined stand-outs like ""Sliders"" after it's first two seasons.  I didn't dislike like Torchwood, but it seems to offer nothing original nor has any particular strong points; if one takes away the ""flash"", there is little left.  As an example - The first show after the opener is very similar to a ""New Outer Limits"" show staring Alisa Milano(sp).  She was possessed by an alien that wanted sexual energy; Torchwood just re-presented this theme with more ""flash"" different cast and venue.  The ""Outer Limits"" version spent more time on character development and plot, the actors were more engaging and it was simply a better (deeper, richer) story (and I'm not that much of a fan of the New Outer Limits).  Torchwood seems geared to ""entertain"" a certain demographic, and it's following a formula to do it.

1104504,A3KOB8M5L0ZYRO,B000VWE5OY,R. Ward,"[4, 7]","There are lots of things wrong with this series, but they mostly don't matter.  Cheesy plots?  Sure.  When did that stop a series from being entertaining? Inconsistent characters?  Check.  Usually there would be no plot if the characters acted predictably and sensibly, after all.  A number of people have commented negatively on the persistent sex (mostly kissing and talking about sex -- very little else happens on camera), which personally I think is one of the best things about the show.  It's pleasantly silly & over the top, especially coming from Captain Jack.  Admittedly if you're offended by characters breathing heavily at each other, this is not a series you will enjoy.  To me the one enormous negative is the character of Gwen Cooper.  She's unbearable.  Gooey brown eyes that round with hurt or surprise at every opportunity.  Empathy that bleeds out of her in ridiculous directions. Snuggle-bunny-ness with boring boyfriend.  Guilt, guilt at not being able to be home for dinner.  I find myself muttering ""silly cow"" almost every time she does or says anything.  She can't even turn her phone off when she's hiding from an alien. Silly cow.  The other female character, Tosh, is only mildly pathetic, and all the males are entertaining in different ways.

I liked the characters, though I did find them a bit shallow, unintelligent, stubborn, prone to mistakes, and unwilling to learn from their mistakes. In the real world, such mistakes would lead to criminal prosecution, and in the very least, an immediate discharge. For example, one character (I won't spoil it for you by giving his name) disobeys orders and opens a rift in time that puts the whole planet in danger. No big deal, he is forgiven! A little far fetched, don't you think?What really put me off is finding out that the lead character, and hero of the series, Jack, is a homosexual.  OK, we live in a world where this is acceptable, but why show intimate kissing (with open mouth and tongue) between the same sexes? Are the writers trying to tell us that this is completely acceptable? Is this series about space aliens or sexual morality?

1104508,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B000VWE5OY,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[1, 3]","Looked at in the whole of his work, Russell T. Davies used his run as executive producer of Doctor Who (2005-2008) to expand the universe surrounding the Time Lord.  Using the Doctor Who anthology as a jumping off point, Davies was able to build the premise that brought Elizabeth Sladen back into the Family of Time as a more mature Sarah Jane Smith...and through the first two series of Doctor Who, built the foundation that led to Torchwood; using ""The Unquiet Dead"" , ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"" and ""Bad Wolf/Parting Of The Ways"" from Series One; then ""Tooth And Claw"" and ""Army of Ghosts/Doomsday"" for establishing the hows and whys for the Institute.It's obvious that the BBC decided that that, in spinning off one of the characters from a reimaging of The Doctor, the one that HAD to be spun off was Jack Harkness.  As portrayed by John Barrowman, Captain Jack was too handsome, too tragically heroic, too charismatic...and too adventurous (Both in his work and his off hours) to NOT have a storyline built around him.  In many ways, Captain Jack is another vision of the Doctor; sort of an off-kilter reflection that one might see in a Hall of Mirrors.  Jack is immortal but wishes for death, a leader who demands his team follow his leadership yet keeps secrets of his past (Their future) from them...Barrowman has matured Jack from his introduction...SOME.  Certainly, he is a more severe and understanding human in Cardiff than he was during his time on the TARDIS...and this plays out over the 13 episodes.Barrowman's equal in this series is the brilliant Eve Myles as the police constable turned Torchwood police liaison Gwen Cooper.  Cooper, a descendant of the housemaid Gwyneth from ""The Unquiet Dead"" (Something that was retconned in Series Four of Doctor Who), observes Torchwood reanimate a corpse in the series opener (""Everything Changes""), and begins a winding trail to--oddly enough--becoming somewhat of a ""Companion"" to Jack.  Myles is an oddly attractive woman--once she gets out of the PC uniform and into regular clothing, she has a wonderful body with that odd gap between the front of her upper teeth--which somehow makes her more human and appealing.  Gwen's adjustment to working at Torchwood--the sequence in ""Ghost Machine"" in which Jack teaches her how to user firearms--makes Gwen almost seem a natural for the unique mission of Torchwood.The rest of the Torchwood team--the medical specialist Owen Harper (Given an angry, arrogant edge by Burn Gorman--at least until ""Out Of Time""), the computer/systems specialist Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori, played as a bit of a wallflower save ""Greeks Bearing Gifts""; in which we find out she holds a torch for Owen) and the administrative specialist Ianto Jones (Gareth Lloyd-Davies, who never seems to have a hair out of place or his suit out of joint--well, except for ""Cyberwoman"" and ""Countrycide"") round out Torchwood Three.Torchwood is a series that delves into the seamier side of Doctor Who's world.  The basic premise of the Torchwood Institute--a first line of defense on Earth against aliens (Aliens in this case defined as beings from other planets AND dimensions in time and space) allows for the issues that might inhabit any law-enforcement unit--relationships (How Gwen cannot tell her boyfriend, Rhys Williams, what she does...or as the season goes on, who she's sleeping with), the usage of what the team garners through the rift, and the potential for corruption from those items.  This is the theme of the first episode, in which the usage of one of the items...and it's corruptive, corrosive nature...leads to the death of one member of the team...and opens up the spot that Gwen fills.  From then on, the season veer wildly--aliens consuming bodies during sex, devices opening portals to the past, cannibals, fairies that aren't all sweet and nice, mind reading devices...oh yeah, and demons looking to consume all life.Overall, Torchwood is a wonderfully different take on the Whoniverse.  It is at times sadder, a little more visceral, and definitely more intense.  Barrowman and Myles give the series a heft and weight that couldn't be displayed in Doctor Who.  But that weight and intensity is why Davies gave this series a run...and it works.Highly recommended.",5,Torchwood Season One--The Dark Reflection Of The Doctor,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,4269,"['Looked', 'whole', 'work', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'used', 'run', 'executive', 'producer', 'Doctor', 'Who', '2005-2008', 'expand', 'universe', 'surrounding', 'Time', 'Lord', 'Using', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'jumping', 'off', 'point', 'Davies', 'was', 'able', 'build', 'premise', 'brought', 'Elizabeth', 'Sladen', 'back', 'Family', 'Time', 'more', 'mature', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Smith', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'built', 'foundation', 'led', 'Torchwood', 'using', 'Unquiet', 'Dead', 'Empty', 'Child/The', 'Doctor', 'Dances', 'Bad', 'Wolf/Parting', 'Ways', 'Series', 'One', 'then', 'Tooth', 'Claw', 'Army', 'Ghosts/Doomsday', 'establishing', 'hows', 'whys', 'Institute.It', 'obvious', 'BBC', 'decided', 'spinning', 'off', 'one', 'characters', 'reimaging', 'Doctor', 'one', 'HAD', 'be', 'spun', 'off', 'was', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'portrayed', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'was', 'too', 'handsome', 'too', 'tragically', 'heroic', 'too', 'charismatic', 'too', 'adventurous', 'work', 'off', 'hours', 'NOT', 'have', 'storyline', 'built', 'many', 'ways', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'vision', 'Doctor', 'sort', 'off-kilter', 'reflection', 'one', 'might', 'see', 'Hall', 'Mirrors', 'Jack', 'immortal', 'wishes', 'death', 'leader', 'who', 'team', 'follow', 'leadership', 'yet', 'keeps', 'secrets', 'past', 'Their', 'future', 'Barrowman', 'matured', 'Jack', 'introduction', 'SOME', 'Certainly', 'more', 'severe', 'understanding', 'human', 'Cardiff', 'was', 'time', 'TARDIS', 'out', '13', 'episodes.Barrowman', 'equal', 'series', 'brilliant', 'Eve', 'Myles', 'police', 'constable', 'turned', 'Torchwood', 'police', 'liaison', 'Gwen', 'Cooper', 'Cooper', 'descendant', 'housemaid', 'Gwyneth', 'Unquiet', 'Dead', 'Something', 'was', 'retconned', 'Series', 'Four', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Torchwood', 'reanimate', 'corpse', 'series', 'opener', 'Everything', 'Changes', 'winding', 'trail', 'oddly', 'enough', 'becoming', 'somewhat', 'Companion', 'Jack', 'Myles', 'oddly', 'attractive', 'woman', 'once', 'PC', 'uniform', 'regular', 'clothing', 'wonderful', 'body', 'odd', 'gap', 'front', 'upper', 'teeth', 'somehow', 'more', 'human', 'appealing', 'Gwen', 'adjustment', 'working', 'Torchwood', 'sequence', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'Jack', 'how', 'user', 'firearms', 'Gwen', 'almost', 'seem', 'natural', 'unique', 'mission', 'Torchwood.The', 'rest', 'Torchwood', 'team', 'medical', 'specialist', 'Owen', 'Harper', 'Given', 'angry', 'arrogant', 'edge', 'Burn', 'Gorman', 'least', 'Time', 'computer/systems', 'specialist', 'Toshiko', 'Sato', 'Naoko', 'Mori', 'played', 'bit', 'wallflower', 'save', 'Greeks', 'Bearing', 'Gifts', 'find', 'out', 'torch', 'Owen', 'administrative', 'specialist', 'Ianto', 'Jones', 'Gareth', 'Lloyd-Davies', 'who', 'never', 'have', 'hair', 'place', 'suit', 'joint', 'well', 'Cyberwoman', 'Countrycide', 'round', 'out', 'Torchwood', 'Three.Torchwood', 'series', 'seamier', 'side', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'world', 'basic', 'premise', 'Torchwood', 'Institute', 'first', 'line', 'defense', 'Earth', 'aliens', 'Aliens', 'case', 'defined', 'beings', 'other', 'planets', 'dimensions', 'time', 'space', 'issues', 'might', 'inhabit', 'law-enforcement', 'unit', 'relationships', 'How', 'Gwen', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'boyfriend', 'Rhys', 'Williams', 'what', 'season', 'who', 'sleeping', 'usage', 'what', 'team', 'garners', 'rift', 'potential', 'corruption', 'items', 'theme', 'first', 'episode', 'usage', 'one', 'items', 'corruptive', 'corrosive', 'nature', 'death', 'one', 'member', 'team', 'up', 'spot', 'Gwen', 'fills', 'then', 'season', 'veer', 'wildly', 'aliens', 'consuming', 'bodies', 'sex', 'devices', 'opening', 'portals', 'past', 'cannibals', 'fairies', 'are', ""n't"", 'sweet', 'nice', 'mind', 'reading', 'devices', 'oh', 'yeah', 'demons', 'looking', 'consume', 'life.Overall', 'Torchwood', 'wonderfully', 'different', 'take', 'Whoniverse', 'times', 'sadder', 'little', 'more', 'visceral', 'definitely', 'more', 'intense', 'Barrowman', 'Myles', 'give', 'series', 'heft', 'weight', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'displayed', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'weight', 'intensity', 'why', 'Davies', 'gave', 'series', 'run', 'works.Highly', 'recommended']",Torchwood: Season 1

Now, most of what was cut out is development of character and plots, sorry they didn't really cut out additional sex folks, but I thought most of it was useful.Many of the disc contain what are called ""deleted"" scenes and these vary from what appear to be last minute cuts to first level editing where the full sound and music is missing.  What I would have really liked (part of the one star reduction in rating) is for these deleted scenes to have been available closer to the actually episode they were cut from.  It would have been very cool to have the option to add them back in and watch the show.The sound was odd with a lot of softness in the introductions on most of the episodes but this sound problem did not continue in the episode itself.  Nothing new as far as I could tell in terms of sound.Probably just as many hours spent on these ""featurettes"" about filming and the actors if you are interested in that sort of thing.

One of the advantages of a Roku with Prime and Netflix, I can try most of them.I will admit, Torchwood was a slow start for me. I would watch an episode and not find it too interesting. The shows seemed kinda cheesy. After several attempts, it finally got my attention. Mid first season, character development really improves, the writing gets better and some of the cheesiness declines.Capt. Jack is somewhat irritating at first. He gets less irritating as the show progesses. Also, if you are offended my gay male leads, then you might want to skip this series. However, I think the episode regarding his namesake, where they kissed, was well done. It was one of the best episodes of season one. At the conclusion of season one, the character of Capt. Jack seems to be the biggest negative distraction to the series for me. I am not sure why, he seems almost transparent and does not come across well. His character improves in a few episodes, then the mannequin type acting restarts. Maybe this is one of the side effects of not being able to die.The other characters do a fine job. No problems.Some of the 'monsters' have this bad Halloween costume type appearance. Thankfully, these do not dominate the series.When it comes to mysteries and crime dramas, the UK produces some of the best, if not the best. When it comes to SciFi type shows, the UK puts much less effort into the quality. This spinoff of the Dr. Who series could have been much better done. The writing and special effects are lacking and those accustomed to the US produced SciFi shows will probably be somewhat disappointed.The first season gets three stars. Not the best but not bad. The last half of the season is by far the better half. I hope season two continues this improvement and turns out to be at least a four star season.The first three seasons of Torchwood are included with Prime. Season four is not.

""Torchwood"" is one of those shows that has a lot of potential and could become quite exceptional. Russell T. Davies ""Dr. Who"" spin-off ""Torchwood"" is a pretty good show and could be an exceptional show if it layed off the sex and violence so much. Why? Because the show focuses entirely too much on it to its own detriment. The first series starts off well if a bit uneven. The pilot ""Every Thing Changes"" sets up the premise of the series but really would have benefited from a two hour or two episode set up since the serial killer story angle isn't developed enough. We meet Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman)the new head of Torchwood a MI-5 like organization that deals with threats from aliens and we don't mean illegal aliens. Torchwood (which is an anagram for ""Doctor Who"") was developed BECAUSE of the good doctor and, when all of its members were turned into Cybermen, Harkness started the organization again in honor of its original primary target--the good Doctor himself. He and his crew including Owen (who looks a bit like Willem Dafoe), Tosh and Suzie deal with alien incursions that occur because of a rift in time/space located in Cardiff. When Gwen a police officer witnessesTorchwood ressurecting one of the victims of the serial killer to try and find out his identity she starts trying to find out more about the investigation, she gets drawn into their world. Gwen is later invited to join Torchwood and assist the group and becomes its conscience filled with the compassion that have become as alien to them as the creatures they hunt.The quality of the writing veers from weak to brilliant over the course of the 13 episodes included. As mentioned the pilot episode could have been much better (it's good but underdeveloped) if it was longer allowing for the plot and characters to be better deveoped. As the series progresses it does get better with ""Countrycide"", ""They Keep Killing Suzie"", ""Random Shoes"" and ""Out of Time"" all well written. The problem is that the show will deal with a emotionally charged issue and then two characters will decide, ""oh, let's go have casual sex right now"". It's an odd shift in tone much more in keeping with a series like ""Queer as Folk"" (also created by Davies)or ""Coupling"" than, say, ""Doctor Who"". As Davies himself states in an extra just because they can show more gore and sex doesn't mean they necessarily have to ALL the time. It disrupts some of the well written narratives and seems almost like the focus of those that are NOT well written with else everything is built around it. ""Out of Time"" and ""Greeks Bearing Gifts"" are both perfect examples where the sexuality is well integrated into the script and inseparable from the story itself. There are others, however, where is like those moments in ""NYPD Blue"" where it felt like it was the obligatory sex scene.Regardless, I like this show and I think fans of ""The X-Files"" or ""Doctor Who"" (and ""Supernatural"") will as well but the writing isn't as sharp as any of those shows. In fact, it suffers from the same flaws (but to a larger degree)as the third season of ""Supernatural"".The show looks like it came from an inferior source with the image quality good when it should be terrific. Perhaps in the switch from the normally incompatable European format to the US or during the Telecine process something unexpected happened or the source wasn't properly handled. Either way, it looks good but could look GREAT given the high definition video format it is shot in.Audio sounds extremely good unlike ""Doctor Who"" the 5.1 mix sounds very good even when it is listened to in 2.0 (the dialogue in""Doctor Who"" tends to get lost in the mix with the music and sound effects overwhelming it--it's not as big an issue here).The extras are terrific as with other BBC shows released by Warner. There are commentary tracks by cast and crew in for every episode of the series. We also get outtakes, a variety of featurettes on each disc on various episodes and, as with ""Doctor Who"", we get the weekly edited version of ""Torchwood: Unclassified"" that runs around two hours on the last disc.""Torchwood"" is a good series that hasn't completely found it's way yet. Once the series begins to find a better balance between its brand of ""adult"" sex and violence (as well as language)with the science fiction, supernatural elements AND character development, ""Torchwood"" will really be something.
