1297406,A2DYMDOAJURO5F,B002WY65VA,"Aceto ""All Knowledge is Sorrow""","[6, 6]","John Keats was the youngest member of the second generation of English Romantic poets. This film arrives just in time for Autumn as in his Ode:""...to swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells with a sweet kernel...""Jane Campion has given us, with the combined help of Pathe, BBC and Australia Film, the kernel of Keats in a quiet film of several small superlatives. The focus is not his biography or even his poetry, but on the slow budding of his only romance, that with Fanny Brawne.I have never heard so much laughter from the audience for a film that is not a comedy. Not belly laughs, but knowing, happy laughter over several subtle moments. You cannot even eat popcorn, so riveted is everybody to this quiet immersion. Gentleman Brown is the brown bear, ranging about, bearing teeth, swiping great paws as foil to the tender side. He is tonic, bitter, but effective.Never has fabric been so pervasive in a film. The use of cloth and wood in the houses opens to expansive lines of laundry flying on lines. Wind is a great animator here, rather than gunfire or other stupid explosives. Here is the zenith of English romantic poetry, when, as the great physicist, Freeman Dyson says, Science & Poetry Were Friends. Wind billows curtains, so we may feel the air here. This is the most tactile film I have seen. You feel all fabrics, all beds and grass and tree bark. Paper is still important, so you see wet ink at the instance of creation.And then there is the lighting. Rooms are painted with color that echoes in the clothing. Fields of flowers do likewise. Fabric, paint, wood and leather all are seen as part of nature, not as some desperate rejection. The cloudy English village lets light show us rooms opening to fields and forest. Woods are great trees everywhere without end. Light breaks where no sun shines, said the poet. In the early scenes of English overcast, we might get the feel of Vermeer, but without his focus for symbolism, staging or placement. This film is painterly.The dank weather of Vermeer is on both sides of the channel. Here, the persistent English clouds hold until that moment when first Keats and Fanny kiss. Then sunlight bathes everything.Now we have flowers everywhere. Old roses, bulbs and fields of flowers, once again picked up in the fabrics of their clothing. All is air and open windows and sun. Poetry is natural, not an artifice. It is a force of nature. There is Mozart; music abounds as does dance. But it does so adjunctly, as a part of seeing their active, intelligent and muscular lives. There is no real soundtrack. Music is evident, obvious, essential, but not a background drone. We need to hear Keats' poetry against a silent and blooming background.The flowers everywhere in spring and summer, and lead us to the fabulous butterfly scene. It makes cheap all the zippo crashing hollow special effects we are tired of yet used to, instead of story and voice that we here have.Finally, we see the bottom of the Spanish Steps in Rome. If you follow the steps, straight past the fountain, down that street, you can have coffee in Keats' daily breakfast place. It is still there, friendly and inviting centuries later.",5,A painterly Film for Poetry's Canvass,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,3173,"['John', 'Keats', 'was', 'youngest', 'member', 'second', 'generation', 'English', 'Romantic', 'poets', 'film', 'just', 'time', 'Autumn', 'Ode', 'swell', 'gourd', 'plump', 'hazel', 'sweet', 'kernel', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'given', 'combined', 'help', 'Pathe', 'BBC', 'Australia', 'Film', 'kernel', 'Keats', 'quiet', 'film', 'several', 'small', 'superlatives', 'focus', 'not', 'biography', 'even', 'poetry', 'slow', 'budding', 'only', 'romance', 'Fanny', 'Brawne.I', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'laughter', 'audience', 'film', 'not', 'comedy', 'Not', 'belly', 'knowing', 'happy', 'laughter', 'several', 'subtle', 'moments', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'eat', 'popcorn', 'so', 'riveted', 'everybody', 'quiet', 'immersion', 'Gentleman', 'Brown', 'brown', 'bear', 'ranging', 'bearing', 'teeth', 'swiping', 'great', 'paws', 'foil', 'tender', 'side', 'tonic', 'bitter', 'effective.Never', 'fabric', 'been', 'so', 'pervasive', 'film', 'use', 'cloth', 'wood', 'houses', 'expansive', 'lines', 'laundry', 'flying', 'lines', 'Wind', 'great', 'animator', 'here', 'rather', 'gunfire', 'other', 'stupid', 'explosives', 'Here', 'zenith', 'English', 'romantic', 'poetry', 'when', 'great', 'physicist', 'Freeman', 'Dyson', 'Science', 'Poetry', 'Were', 'Friends', 'Wind', 'curtains', 'may', 'feel', 'air', 'here', 'most', 'tactile', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'feel', 'fabrics', 'beds', 'grass', 'tree', 'bark', 'Paper', 'still', 'important', 'see', 'wet', 'ink', 'instance', 'creation.And', 'then', 'lighting', 'Rooms', 'are', 'painted', 'color', 'clothing', 'Fields', 'flowers', 'do', 'likewise', 'Fabric', 'paint', 'wood', 'leather', 'are', 'seen', 'part', 'nature', 'not', 'desperate', 'rejection', 'cloudy', 'English', 'village', 'lets', 'light', 'show', 'rooms', 'opening', 'fields', 'forest', 'Woods', 'are', 'great', 'trees', 'everywhere', 'end', 'Light', 'breaks', 'where', 'sun', 'shines', 'said', 'poet', 'early', 'scenes', 'English', 'overcast', 'might', 'get', 'feel', 'Vermeer', 'focus', 'symbolism', 'staging', 'placement', 'film', 'painterly.The', 'dank', 'weather', 'Vermeer', 'sides', 'channel', 'Here', 'persistent', 'English', 'clouds', 'hold', 'moment', 'when', 'first', 'Keats', 'Fanny', 'kiss', 'Then', 'sunlight', 'bathes', 'have', 'flowers', 'everywhere', 'Old', 'bulbs', 'fields', 'flowers', 'once', 'again', 'picked', 'up', 'fabrics', 'clothing', 'air', 'open', 'windows', 'sun', 'Poetry', 'natural', 'not', 'artifice', 'force', 'nature', 'Mozart', 'music', 'dance', 'so', 'adjunctly', 'part', 'seeing', 'active', 'intelligent', 'muscular', 'lives', 'real', 'soundtrack', 'Music', 'evident', 'obvious', 'essential', 'not', 'background', 'drone', 'need', 'hear', 'Keats', 'poetry', 'silent', 'blooming', 'background.The', 'flowers', 'everywhere', 'spring', 'summer', 'lead', 'fabulous', 'butterfly', 'scene', 'cheap', 'zippo', 'crashing', 'hollow', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'tired', 'yet', 'used', 'instead', 'story', 'voice', 'here', 'have.Finally', 'see', 'bottom', 'Spanish', 'Steps', 'Rome', 'follow', 'steps', 'straight', 'fountain', 'street', 'can', 'have', 'coffee', 'Keats', 'daily', 'breakfast', 'place', 'still', 'there', 'friendly', 'inviting', 'centuries', 'later']",Bright Star
1297407,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B002WY65VA,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[4, 6]","The absolute best moment of this biopic of the English poet John Keats comes at the very end as the closing titles roll when Ben Wishaw who plays Keats reads his ""Ode to a Nightingale"" and we hear the wonderful poetry. Of course, it's spoiled by the annoying, gloomy music that accompanies this entire movie.So Keats is talented but penniless. He falls in love with the next-door neighbor, the feisty Fanny Brawne. The love affair ends, as it must, both unconsummated and unhappily as Keats dies from consumption aged only 26. We see the characters walking around a lot in the woods, climbing trees and gamboling around in the daffodils and bluebells. There is also the hint of a love triangle because the poet's roommate, Mr. Brown, is almost like a jealous wife, insanely envious of the love growing between Keats and Fanny.This is a very restrained movie. The acting is pretty good but not much happens and of course we get half an hour of coughing, in fine Hollywood and operatic tradition, before the poet expires, thankfully offscreen.We don't really get a sense of Keats the genius, of what moved and inspired him. I guess we're supposed to think that Fanny inspired him.It wasn't bad if you like a couple of hours of gloomy unfulfilled love, nice costumes and pretty pictures.",3,The short miserable life of John Keats,1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,1284,"['absolute', 'best', 'moment', 'biopic', 'English', 'poet', 'John', 'Keats', 'very', 'end', 'closing', 'titles', 'roll', 'when', 'Ben', 'Wishaw', 'who', 'Keats', 'Ode', 'Nightingale', 'hear', 'wonderful', 'poetry', 'course', 'spoiled', 'annoying', 'gloomy', 'music', 'entire', 'movie.So', 'Keats', 'talented', 'penniless', 'love', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'feisty', 'Fanny', 'Brawne', 'love', 'affair', 'must', 'unconsummated', 'unhappily', 'Keats', 'consumption', 'aged', 'only', '26', 'see', 'characters', 'walking', 'lot', 'woods', 'climbing', 'trees', 'gamboling', 'around', 'daffodils', 'bluebells', 'also', 'hint', 'love', 'triangle', 'poet', 'roommate', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'almost', 'jealous', 'wife', 'insanely', 'envious', 'love', 'growing', 'Keats', 'Fanny.This', 'very', 'restrained', 'movie', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'much', 'happens', 'course', 'get', 'hour', 'coughing', 'fine', 'Hollywood', 'operatic', 'tradition', 'poet', 'thankfully', 'offscreen.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'Keats', 'genius', 'what', 'moved', 'inspired', 'guess', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'think', 'Fanny', 'inspired', 'him.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'like', 'couple', 'hours', 'gloomy', 'unfulfilled', 'love', 'nice', 'costumes', 'pretty', 'pictures']",Bright Star

I fell under its enchantment from the opening bars of Mozart's Serenade No. 10, to Fanny's tragic recitation in the closing scene of ""Ode to a Nightingale."" It was as close to ""catharsis"" as I have felt in any movie or book this year. I have not felt this same yearning for the happiness of two frail beings, since, perhaps, my reading of Tess of the D'urbavilles. I have seldom had to pause and rewind so often, to notice the way the wind blew, or the flowers shivered, or the children played, or poetry sounded, or linen danced, or candle-wax spilled, or hands touched, or an emotion flickered across Fanny's face, or an octagon-shaped table with inkwells and quills looked like.

1297411,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002WY65VA,Andrew Ellington,"[52, 55]","My wife, bless her soul, did something wonderful for me this past week.  Despite her personal regard for this film (she fell asleep in the theater), her knowledge of my personal respect and admiration for John Keats (my favorite poet to ever walk the earth) and my feelings towards this film (one of the top five best of this past year, easy) moved her to buy this movie for me last Tuesday.  She even found herself searching store after store since, for some reason, a lot of places weren't carrying it.Alas, I've already watched this three times this past week.Jane Campion is a marvelous director who has stunned me many times, and if you have ever wondered what a Jane Austen adaptation would look like under her sensual guidance, you have your answer in `Bright Star'.  I will say this; this movie is by far one of the most sensually stimulating films I've ever seen.  That isn't to say that it is an explicit film (nothing close to `The Piano') but Campion has a wonderful way of eliciting in the viewer a raw and natural emotion, that of longing and desire, and she paints such a beautifully desirous picture that we are left with baited breath.The way Keats caresses Fanny's hand; the way she removes a key from her necklace; the way the press their bodies against a wall just to be nearer to one another.  Every frame is captured in such a provocative way that we are so entranced and so, excited.If you've seen the film, then you may recognize where the title of my review is pulled from.The film tells of the final years of Keats' life.  Keats' story is tragic because, at the young age of twenty-five he died of tuberculosis.  Sadly, he considered himself a failure, yet today he is renowned as one of the (if not the) best romantic poets who ever lived.  This splendid film follows his relationship with two very important people; his dear friend Charles and his muse (and love) Fanny.  As Keats attempts to make a name for himself, he finds that he is spellbound by Fanny, a self professed artistic soul, and realizes that finding love in her stirred something magical in him (his letters to Fanny are some of the most moving and provoking words ever penned).  Sadly, their relationship was marred by jealousy (on the part of Charles) and social status (he was poor, and thus never wed Fanny) and was eventually cut drastically short by Keats' tragic death.Campion is a goddess as far as I'm concerned, lacing this film with such glorious emotion and tender affections.Breaking down this film and trying to explain all that I find so amazing is hard.  To say that this film flows like poetry seems rather clich&eacute;d beings that it is about a poet, but the statement would be a true one.  There is a rich fluidity that exudes every frame and just milks the entire film.  The cinematography is easily the best I've seen all year, with some of the most beautiful screen shots of any film, ever.  I mean, the butterflies, the bluebonnets, the windows, the hands...everything breathes a life of its own, and it is simply stunning (and soul reaching).  You can feel every frame beneath your skin.  The score is simple yet refreshing, and the vocal harmonies add a layer of depth and humanity to the film.  The costumes and sets are outstanding.  I love how one review stated that this film really made you feel as though you were LIVING in that era, and it is so true.  Everything feels authentic, yet it's painted with such lush brushstrokes it appears almost dreamlike.And then there are the performances.What can I say really?  I mean, I have been a huge fan of Paul Schneider since his breakout year in 2007 (he just oozes sensual chemistry) and he doesn't disappoint.  Some have attacked his accent, but I found it authentic and unwavering; and his eventual breakdown (""I failed John Keats!"") is so touching and heart-tugging.  Ben Whishaw is a new talent, and an agreeable one.  I do find that this film paints Keats as a canvas for those around him (much like Benjamin Button was last year) and so he comes off a tad less interesting or captivating, but Whishaw has some remarkable moments.  The life of this film is, without doubt, Abbie Cornish.  I was crossing my fingers this morning for a surprise Oscar nomination for her, since outside of Carey Mulligan, she delivers the best performance of the entire year, in any category.  The way she captures the edginess of this woman (her sharp wit, especially when conversing with Charles, is catching) while never discarding her tender affections (the way she describes her adoration of Keats is the pure definition of poetry) is just spellbinding.  There is such natural warmth and progression of character, and that final breakdown (shaky hands, gaping breaths, near seizure-like panic) is so authentic, so powerful and so...unforgettable.I want to cry.So, now I have to end this review.  I'm not sure what else I can say outside of SEE THIS MOVIE.  If you are not a fan of the period piece then you probably should avoid it, since this is really a film that defines that genre, but if you are a fan of Jane Austen, Jane Campion (this is her best film since `The Piano') and or poetry then you will fall in love with this film; quite literally.",5,Everything...,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,5215,"['wife', 'soul', 'did', 'something', 'wonderful',

The sceneary, beautiful. The costumes, beautful. The diologue, the people, the story, everything was beautiful. I have no idea where this movie was filmed, I do know that I want to go there. I'd probably be happy turning the volume down and just watching this movie because it is so asteticly pleasing.The people in this movie are beautiful. They are real fleshed out characters who do not act selfishly or rashly, and yet are true to the love they feel for each other. There was deep emotion between the two and that was beautiful.Why not 5 stars? I can't put my finger on it, but I can say there was something missing. I think there was an element of quickness and disjointedness at times that left me a little confussed. I came to believe that this movie was intended to have a poetic feel, so when theres a random scene with John Keats up in a tree and someone standing in teh curtains I tried to ignor my confussion and let a mood be created, but at times it felt like the mood was being created at the sacrifice of the story. The fact that the scene where Keats gets jealous came out of the blue for me, or the parts relating to Fanny's despart actions when she believes Keats isn't coming back were rushed and brushed over left me wishing for more details and build up or reasons to believe that the same wasn't going to happen again.",4,Beautiful,1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,1464,"['end', 'day', 'there', 'be', 'something', 'said', 'anything', 'just', 'beautiful', 'what', 'film', 'sceneary', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'beautful', 'diologue', 'people', 'story', 'everything', 'was', 'beautiful', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'do', 'know', 'want', 'go', 'there', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'happy', 'turning', 'volume', 'down', 'just', 'watching', 'movie', 'so', 'asteticly', 'pleasing.The', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'beautiful', 'are', 'real', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'act', 'selfishly', 'rashly', 'yet', 'are', 'true', 'love', 'feel', 'other', 'was', 'deep', 'emotion', 'two', 'was', 'beautiful.Why', 'not', '5', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'something', 'missing', 'think', 'was', 'element', 'quickness', 'disjointedness', 'times', 'left', 'little', 'confussed', 'came', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'intended', 'have', 'poetic', 'feel', 'so', 'when', 'random', 'scene', 'John', 'Keats', 'up', 'tree', 'someone', 'standing', 'teh', 'curtains', 'tried', 'ignor', 'confussion', 'let', 'mood', 'be', 'created', 'times', 'felt', 'mood', 'was', 'being', 'created', 'sacrifice', 'story', 'fact', 'scene', 'where', 'Keats', 'jealous', 'came', 'blue', 'parts', 'relating', 'Fanny', 'despart', 'actions', 'when', 'Keats', ""n't"", 'coming', 'back', 'were', 'rushed', 'brushed', 'left', 'wishing', 'more', 'details', 'build', 'up', 'reasons', 'believe', 'same', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'happen', 'again']",Bright Star
1297415,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B002WY65VA,Brian C.,"[6, 7]","I thought this was actually a really excellent movie. I watched it awhile ago and it took me a little while to decide whether I liked it or not. Eventually I decided that I really liked the movie quite a lot, but it took me even longer to figure out why; and now I am going to tell you (this is also my SPOILER ALERT). There are a number of reasons.The movie was, I think, one of the most emotionally powerful movies I have ever seen. One of the central themes of literary Romanticism (Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Keats, Holderlin, etc.) is the theme of infinite longing. The Romantics discovered, or believed they discovered, a longing within the human heart that simply could not be satisfied or find its adequate object within the finite world. This insight, that the world is a veil of tears, lies behind the mood of melancholy that is so prevalent in Romantic poetry. The Romantics did a great job expressing that infinite longing within their poetry and this film does an excellent job expressing it through the medium of film and narrative.The story is the story of the poet John Keats, who died at the age of 25, and his engagement to Fanny Brawne just before his death. The story is by nature a sad, melancholy story and I was aware of that going in. Sometimes I get annoyed when it is clear to me that movies are manipulating my emotions, usually because moviemakers have become such masters at manipulating emotion. I did not get annoyed with this movie, however, despite the fact that it manipulated my emotions as well as any movie I have ever seen. I think the reason it did not annoy me in this movie is because the emotions felt genuine and real to me. Hollywood seems to have a very difficult time dealing with emotion. They tend to over-dramatize it and that was a very real danger for a movie like this since, 1) it tells the story of first love which is so easy to over-dramatize, and 2) it is telling the story of a Romantic poet and the Romantic poets themselves tended to romanticize (i.e. over-dramatize) their emotions (hence the moniker).I thought this movie succeeded very well in portraying the reality of first love without turning it into a cliche. It is difficult not to over-dramatize first love because first love does tend to consume the whole world and seem like a much bigger deal when it is happening then it really is, and the moviemaker has to find some way to portray that without believing it themselves (it is when moviemakers believe it themselves that they run into the problem of sentimentality). I thought this movie did a good job of portraying the agonies of first love (Fanny sitting and waiting for letters from Keats when he is away) without turning it into a cliche or indulging in sentimentality.Now back to my original point. The movie succeeds in portraying the infinite longing that is a theme of so much Romantic poetry by portraying a love that certainly feels infinite to both parties involved while being doomed to be radically finite. John Keats and Fanny Brawne only had around two years together, and they were separated during much of that time. When you are in love there is usually some desire to spend eternity together. The longing for something eternal is partly why the Romantics considered romantic love to be so noble, it seems to aspire to something beyond this world. Unfortunately the world we live in is radically finite and impermanent to its very core. Our days are numbered. Keats and Brawne had less time together than most of us but it is merely a matter of degree.The climax of the movie comes, in my opinion, when Keats is about to travel to Italy to try to regain his health. Keats is fairly certain that he is dying, and that his death will come sooner rather than later, and it is his last night with Fanny Brawne. Keats says (I am paraphrasing now), ""This will most likely be the last time we see each other on this mortal earth"" and Fanny cries, ""No!"". Keats continues, ""We have woven a web on top of this world but it is now time to start cutting the threads."" At some point Fanny cries, ""There has to be another life beyond this one. We cannot have been made for such suffering!"". That is one of the most powerful lines in the movie and it perfectly expresses the infinite longing that I think is the theme of this movie and of so much Romantic poetry. There must be something beyond this finite world. We cannot have been created just to grieve and to suffer.That is ultimately the feeling that the movie leaves you with. It is somewhat disconcerting which is why I could not decide right away whether I liked the movie. I was not entirely pleased with where the movie left me. Keats dies, of course, and there is certainly no guarantee within the movie (or within life for that matter) that there is any life or world beyond this one in which the grief portrayed in the movie will be resolved or made good. It was only a week or two later that I realized that is precisely what a great deal of Romantic poetry is attempting to convey, and it was at that point that I decided not only that I really liked the movie, but was able to figure out why.Finally, I cannot end my review without quickly praising two other aspects of the movie. First, none of the characters were one dimensional. John Keats' friend Charles Brown is a particularly interesting and well played character. Second, cinematically the film is quite beautiful. There are beautiful scenes in fields of flowers and equally beautiful scenes with butterflies playing in the light. It all seems to fit perfectly with the subject matter and the era of Romantic poetry.",5,Succeeds in capturing the Romantic longing for the infinite...,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,5623,"['thought',

Only finally does he redeem himself, in an interesting confession on his utter neglect of Keats. In several scenes, oddly, Brown destroys the magic between the leads.The lush cinematography and costume work surpasses one's expectations, the tenderness of the love scenes captivates, as does the fragility of the courting, and ultimately, the final crushing loss. (Cornish is brilliant in her scene reacting to Keats' death.)There is much to adore here, with small exquisite moments one may easily miss.

1297419,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B002WY65VA,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","This film has much to be admired. The art direction is beautiful and reveals 18th century rural England in a romantic and yet realistic perspective. There are few films that would give the viewer a real glimpse into what life might be like in another century but this film is able to achieve that goal.  The screenplay was superb, it is not so much complex as subtle. The acting was outstanding. Overall this is a highly recommended film. Jane Campion&#8217;s sensitivities to theme, character, and especially the flow of time was very evident. Before electricity and the industrial revolution, families were with each other constantly, working, playing and in each other&#8217;s business.  This film depicts this so well as Fanny Brawne, played by Abbie Cornish, engages in an extended engagement with the romantic poet, John Keats, played perfectly by Ben Whishaw. Cornish plays her role as an independent and intelligent young woman who falls in love with a poor undiscovered literary genius. Whishaw is exceptional in portraying the vulnerability and ambiguities of poverty, ill health, and romantic obsession. John Keats was a Romantic Poet during that period of transition between the Neo-Classical world of the Napoleonic wars to the Romantic period of Wordsworth and Coleridge. Unfortunately, a few years after losing his young brother to tuberculosis he also dies of the disease at age 25.The film also unfolds the relationship between mentor Charles Armitage Brown, played perfectly by Paul Schneider, and Keats; a relationship that competed with Keat&#8217;s relationship with Fanny.  This creates a tension throughout the film that is finally broken with the death of Keats. Fanny&#8217;s two younger siblings play a role of companions but also co-conspirators in the love affair between Fanny and John Keats. This feature of the film is charming for Jane Campion reveals these children to be both innocent and yet fully aware of the power of human love. It conveys the message that romantic love, with all its power and depth, can be understood by children.This is a beautiful and moving film. It is a feast for the eye yet a tragedy of lost potential as Keat&#8217;s love and art are cut short by disease.

1297427,A38B6JNQA3USU7,B002WY65VA,Edward Waters,"[7, 8]","This film has a feel much like that of the better Jane Austen adaptations. There is, of course, its nearly identical setting: Pre-Victorian 19th-century England, with the same tangles of family dynamics, social expectation, and voluminous clothing. It is also beautifully filmed, juxtaposing natural scenery with the sparely furnished interiors of homes rented by highborn classes fallen on hard times yet forced to keep up appearances. More important similarities, however, are reflected in the characters themselves and their various journeys of growth, understanding, and love. Even the one role which might easily have come off as merely adversarial ultimately proves more complex, discovering something of conscience and even a hint of pity.Unlike Austen's classics, however, this tale is fated to end in heartbreak. Written and directed by Jane Campion, BRIGHT STAR dramatizes the last three years in the life of poet John Keats and speculates on his relationship with Fanny Brawne, for whom he wrote the poem from which the film takes it name. Ben Whishaw and Abbie Cornish in the leads build their characters slowly, so that we are not certain at first whether we will like either of them at all. Yet, with starts and stumbles, they develop a bond of such tenderness that only the hardest heart can fail to embrace their ultimate tragedy and grief. And somehow all this is managed without quite crossing the line into maudlin.As the film ended and Keats words were heard at length over the closing credits, I found myself wanting to know better the poet's life and work.

1297428,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B002WY65VA,Elisabeth,"[6, 10]","The best thing about this film is the scenery.  You could press the Pause button on your remote anywhere in this movie and see a lovely shot.  You could choose the scene where John Keats climbs up a tree and lies in a bed of flowers.  Or the outdoor park scenes that reminded me of the paintings by both Manet and Seurat.  Or the scene where Fanny is sitting on her bed facing the window and the curtain floats up towards her like it's trying to reach her but can't.  Or even the ending where you have a white snow scene with dark clothed figures in stark contrast.I also liked the close-up shots, too.  I liked the close-up shot of dead butterflies being swept away (especially since previously the butterflies had been freely flying around Fanny's room earlier, showing off their beauty).  And then there's the close-up shot of Fanny cutting her hair followed by another close-up shot of her boots where the hair falls next to them.  It's these kinds of careful shots that interest me.However, it's the acting that makes this movie suffer.  The only actor who impressed me in this film was Paul Sneider.  Sneider plays John Keat's friend Charles Armitage Brown.  Sneider is the only actor in this film who really seemed to understand the point of the story and the motivations of his character.  He has a biting sarcasm that manages not to be overdone.  He knows when to push and when to pull away.Abbie Cornish plays Keat's love interest Fanny Brawne.  Cornish is stunningly beautiful, even in plain clothing (although her clothing is actually supposed to appear avant-garde for her time, it looked plain to me).  However, her acting fell flat at times.  Sure, she's able to cry on cue, but her eyes betray her.  Her tears are real, but the sincerity behind them is not.  And so, I wasn't moved when she cried (and I usually always cry during sad scenes).  The only part where her acting came off convincingly is when she has verbal sparring matches with Charles.Ben Whipshaw plays John Keats and his acting is the most disappointing.  In fact, it's his weak acting that ruined the film for me.  He has the same flat expression on his face throughout the film no matter if the scene is supposed to be joyous or sad.For example, there's a scene where he's at the dinner table and reaches for Fanny's hand.  The gesture is intended to reveal his passion for Fanny, but since his face looks distracted and far away, it doesn't work as intended.  It was as if he made that gesture simply because the script asked for it, but there was no feeling behind it.Another example is when Fanny is sitting on the couch weeping in front of him and he just stares at her with the same flat, disconnected expression, looking totally unmoved by her tears.  As a result of his acting, I couldn't feel his love for her.  And since he treats Charles the same way, I couldn't feel his love for him either.If I had just read the script for this movie, I would've thought this was a very romantic love story.  For example, there's a scene where Fanny and John are lying in bed and John is telling her where he'd like to kiss her and she tells him to kiss her everywhere.  Very romantic stuff here, but too bad it falls flat onscreen.These two actors just couldn't seem to connect with one another onscreen.  When she'd go left, he'd go right.  Because their acting was so off-center and because it seemed like Fanny was way more into John than he was into her, I was unable to get swept up by this romance and the movie seemed to drag on for too long.So what should've been a passionate romance came off as a flat romance instead.",2,A flat romance,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,3610,"['best', 'thing', 'film', 'scenery', 'could', 'press', 'Pause', 'button', 'remote', 'anywhere', 'movie', 'see', 'lovely', 'shot', 'could', 'choose', 'scene', 'where', 'John', 'Keats', 'up', 'tree', 'bed', 'flowers', 'outdoor', 'park', 'scenes', 'reminded', 'paintings', 'Manet', 'Seurat', 'scene', 'where', 'Fanny', 'sitting', 'bed', 'facing', 'window', 'curtain', 'up', 'towards', 'trying', 'reach', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'ending', 'where', 'have', 'white', 'snow', 'scene', 'dark', 'clothed', 'figures', 'stark', 'contrast.I', 'also', 'liked', 'close-up', 'shots', 'too', 'liked', 'close-up', 'shot', 'dead', 'butterflies', 'being', 'swept', 'away', 'especially', 'previously', 'butterflies', 'had', 'been', 'freely', 'flying', 'Fanny', 'room', 'earlier', 'showing', 'off', 'beauty', 'then', 'close-up', 'shot', 'Fanny', 'cutting', 'hair', 'followed', 'close-up', 'shot', 'boots', 'where', 'hair', 'next', 'kinds', 'careful', 'shots', 'interest', 'me.However', 'acting', 'movie', 'suffer', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'impressed', 'film', 'was', 'Paul', 'Sneider', 'Sneider', 'John', 'Keat', 'friend', 'Charles', 'Armitage', 'Brown', 'Sneider', 'only', 'actor', 'film', 'who', 'really', 'seemed', 'understand', 'point', 'story', 'motivations', 'character', 'biting', 'sarcasm', 'not', 'be', 'overdone', 'when', 'push', 'when', 'pull', 'away.Abbie', 'Cornish', 'Keat', 'love', 'interest', 'Fanny', 'Brawne', 'Cornish', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'even', 'plain', 'clothing', 'clothing', 'actually', 'supposed', 'appear', 'avant-garde', 'time', 'looked', 'plain', 'However', 'acting', 'fell', 'flat', 'times', 'Sure', 'able', 'cry', 'cue', 'eyes', 'tears', 'are', 'real', 'sincerity', 'not', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'moved', 'when', 'cried', 'usually', 'always', 'cry', 'sad', 'scenes', 'only', 'part', 'where', 'acting', 'came', 'off', 'convincingly', 'when', 'verbal', 'sparring', 'matches', 'Charles.Ben', 'Whipshaw', 'John', 'Keats', 'acting', 'most', 'disappointing', 'fact', 'weak', 'acting', 'ruined', 'film', 'same', 'flat', 'expression', 'face', 'film', 'matter', 'scene', 'supposed', 'be', 'joyous', 'sad.For', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'dinner', 'table', 'reaches', 'Fanny', 'hand', 'gesture', 'intended', 'reveal', 'passion', 'Fanny', 'face', 'distracted', 'far', 'away', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'intended', 'was', 'made', 'gesture', 'simply', 'script', 'asked', 'was', 'feeling', 'it.Another', 'example', 'when', 'Fanny', 'sitting', 'couch', 'weeping', 'front', 'just', 'same', 'flat', 'disconnected', 'expression', 'looking', 'totally', 'unmoved', 'tears', 'result', 'acting', 'could', ""n't"", 'feel', 'love', 'Charles', 'same', 'way', 'could', ""n't"", 'feel', 'love', 'either.If', 'had', 'just', 'read', 'script', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'romantic', 'love', 'story', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Fanny', 'John', 'are', 'lying', 'bed', 'John', 'telling', 'where', ""'d"", 'like', 'kiss', 'kiss', 'everywhere', 'Very', 'romantic', 'stuff', 'here', 'too', 'bad', 'flat', 'onscreen.These', 'two', 'actors', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'connect', 'one', 'onscreen', 'When', ""'d"", 'go', 'left', ""'d"", 'go', 'right', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'off-center', 'seemed', 'Fanny', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'John', 'was', 'was', 'unable', 'get', 'swept', 'up', 'romance', 'movie', 'seemed', 'drag', 'too', 'long.So', 'what', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'passionate', 'romance', 'came', 'off', 'flat', 'romance', 'instead']",Bright Star

Don't worry if you haven't read John Keats since high school, and then perhaps only the shortest of his poems. If this film doesn't send you to your library or local bookshop to confirm your love of language, then you had no business watching it in the first place.I have to wonder ... how could anybody ever, even a critic, have read a stanza of Keats without recognizing that he was the loveliest natural poet the English language has ever brought forth:The poetry of earth is never dead:When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,And hide in the cooling trees, a voice will runFrom hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead ...orSeason of mists and mellow fruitfulness,Close bosom friend of the maturing sun;Conspiring with him how to load and blessWith fruits the vines that round the thatch eves run;To bend with apples the mossed cottage trees,And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shellsWith a sweet kernel; to set budding more,And still more later flowers for the beesUntil they think warm days will never cease.But if you don't like language, you can still thrill to your toenails at the cinematography of this sad film. Once every decade or so, a film is made that recreates the bygone beauty of pre-industrial Earth, a film like the 1991 Tous les Matins du Monde. This is a film that beautiful; it amazes me that the producers could find enough of early 19th C England intact to stage it. But it's not only the sets and sights; it's the pure photography, as perfectly composed in every scene as an Impressionist masterpiece. How could they make a even soggy, muddy trudge through a London slum so touchingly gorgeous?As my samples should prove, Keats was the sublime poet of the beauties of the seasons.

1297434,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002WY65VA,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","John Keats is still hailed as one of the greatest of the Romantic Poets and Writer/Director Jane Campion offers a biographically centered yet lyrically poetic version of the few years that that inspired so many memorable works.  She has carefully studied the letters of John Keats to his muse Fanny Brawne, researched the period in and around 1818 and has devised a love story that ranks with the finest of Romantic writers.  This is a film to absorb slowly, with repeated viewings, a dream like tale of just what the measured passions of the period were like during the time in which they unfolded.There is a strange triangle here: Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish of 'A Good Year' and 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age') lives with her mother (the subtle actress Kerry Fox) and here siblings (fine, detailed performances by Edie Martin and Thomas Sangster).  In part of the house lives one Charles Armitage Brown (Paul Schneider of 'Lars & the Real Girl', 'The Assassination of Jesses James...', etc), a wannabe artist who shares his living space with John Keats (the brilliant Ben Wishaw of 'Perfume', 'Brideshead Revisited', 'I'm Not There' etc) who along with writing poetry he finds difficult to publish is caring for his dying brother.  Brown loves Keats and is devoted to his happiness, but vies for the attention of Fanny who is caught up in her own 'artistry' of sewing.  From Keats Fanny learns about poetry, a form of art she has not encountered, and in the times she spends with Keats as her teacher she simultaneously avoids the advances of Brown and instead feels her heart awaken to Keats. Fanny's mother sees Keats' gifts and deeply admires him, but warns her daughter not to become involved with a poet who cannot support her expectations of marriage into wealth.  The triangle of love and devotion among Keats, Brown, and now Fanny is the core of the story and is handled in the most subtle way that few other directors than Campion could accomplish.Keats develops tuberculosis and for heath reasons is instructed to go to the warmer climes of Italy for recovery.  It is from Italy that Keats writes his letters (and a poem 'Bright Star') to Fanny  that seals the hearts and souls of the two delicate lovers.  Keats succumbs to his disease and Fanny continues her life of celibacy, wandering the heath, longing for the love of her life.The DVD offers comments form Jane Campion regarding the making of this film and her insights into the characters shed precious light on the film.  The cast is exceptional, with stunning portrayals by Wishaw, Cornish, Schneider and Fox.  This is a gentle film to treasure, much the way we still treasure the poems of the inimitable John Keats.

This historical significance of a beloved poet, Keats, gives it another aspect which will be enjoyed by yet other following. The romance is just a measure flat, but that has to do more with the attempt to make this story accurate to the life of Keats. Not a fault of the dialogue, and writing. Keats had only a short time to experience love, and his poetry falls short only in quantity of what could have been. Death stole him much too young. Abbie Cornish (""Outriders"",""Candy"",""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"") and Ben Whishaw (""Brideshead Revisited"") make it a believable love affair.Jane Campion, dir/prod, states in bonus interviews that the movie was shot outside of London at the Hyde House, Ashridge Estate. Beautiful, perfection, and every wonderful facet of the grounds were used for the film. Other bonus include one 2-min. deleted scene (why delete?); and 3 featurettes (10 minute total): Becoming Keats & Fanny, Setting the Scene, An Inspiring romance.Subtitles provided.So watch this as a documentary, romantic drama, for Keats written words, for the period excellence, or just for entertainment.

Unlike that film, however, which consisted of visually pleasing frames with very little action, ""Bright Star"" slowly but surely builds into a climax that will break your heart. The cinematography is beautiful beyond description. It is as if Vermeer came back to life as a photographer.That Ms. Campion has given us a film about a Nineteenth Century dying poet who falls in love with his next-door neighbor that engages the most jaded of us speaks to her genius as a film director. That she is able to have the actors speak from the poems and letters of Keats to Brawne and make them believable and moving also speaks to her talent. This story in the hands of a lesser director could have sunk into sentimental nothingness, but it does not. You do not have to be a lover of romantic poetry to relate to this movie since it is about a mother who does not want her daughter to marry a poor poet who has no visible means of supporting her and a love affair that because of a mortal illness is destined for tragedy. Surely these themes are as relevant in 2010 as they were in the Nineteenth Century.One final comment: as the credits go up, there is a voice-over of the reading of ""Ode to A Nightingale.""

I must be spoiled by such impressive period pieces as A&E;'s Pride and Prejudice and Masterpiece Theatre's recent Jane Austen remakes.To open the film is a soundtrack that is both annoying and painful to the ear. Gio might like it; a stringed thing that sounds like forks scraping on a plate. To add to this morose droning are the meagerly appointed sets and backgrounds. The town looks like the old western set from the movie Shane, with fancy lads instead of cattleman and farmers. The interior shots are in rooms that have nothing on the walls but paint. It's like the director rented a conveniently unoccupied house and threw in some old furniture expecting good acting to carry the day. Not! The actors seemed neither comfortable nor plausible in any of the settings. Even the outdoors scenes appear to have been shot in random fields without much thought about the locations. Apparently they couldn't afford a Mexican lawn maintenance team to trim the grass where the socialites were playing soccer. The actors are reasonable given the minimal material they had to work with. They are pretty, handsome, cute, and completely unrealistic. The main character Keats, looks skeletal and diminutive compared to the buxom woman he adores. She could squash him with her big toe or knock him over with her pinky. What she really needs is a, ""Marlboro man"". It's the usual, ""he isn't rich enough to marry his lover"", problem. So we must endure this unlikely relationship with a wink and a nod as the stilted and plodding pace heads toward its predictable conclusion: Keats's death. I thought to myself, I wish this guy would hurry up and die, so he can get published posthumously and finally marry this whiny, spoiled wench. He is a better fit socioeconomically and intimately as a corpse, no doubt. Spoiler alert! My wish came true after the poet artistically rode on the outside of a carriage, without a jacket, in the cold and wet only to conveniently become deathly ill. This death sequence drags on for another 20 minutes as he leaves his love to go to Italy to get better, but eventually dies anyway without his love by his side. Yay! Hey, but this film is about Keats, the famous English poet! The director makes sure to cram a little of his poetry into the script. A boring dinner conversation is livened up with a passage or two and naturally the guests are wholly enthralled and amazed by this little chaps words. If only I could have been as impressed as these actors apparently pretended to be. Spoiler alert: after dinner Keats entertains his hosts with a Scottish jig.

Though it's mostly historically accurate, as far as I know, it's a romance above all else. And it is done very well. The whole movie has a very quiet feel- beautiful cinematography that uses a lot of natural light (it reminds me a lot of the 1995 Persuasion in its realistic look), exquisite costumes, and brilliant acting. Even the music, while beautiful, is quiet. There are sensual undertones throughout, but the romance, like the movie itself, is very restrained. The heroine is usually ""chaperoned"" by her younger siblings (her sister, Toots, is beyond adorable!), and the pair cannot marry due to poverty and then Keats' illness. Keats' friend and roommate, the greasy Mr. Brown, also tries to prevent their romance, but this really seems to only encourage them! The ending is tragic (Keats died of consumption at age 25) but the movie is just gorgeous.The movie is worth watching for the cinematography alone. Everything is understated and subtle, and yet left a bigger impression on me than anything on a grander scale ever has.By far my favorite thing about this movie was the costumes! It's set in the Regency, which is always a plus (for me at least. I love the fashions from that period). The heroine, Fanny, is a seamstress and prides herself on her fashionable clothes, which she makes all herself. I loved that the clothes in this actually looked hand-stitched. Fanny's gowns in the beginning can be a bit over-the-top (bright colors, big hats and collars) but become more subdued throughout the course of the film. Most of her shoes are really cute too, take notice! Some of Toots' dresses use the same fabrics as Fanny's, which I thought was a nice touch.This movie is not for everyone. If you like a lot of action and that sort of thing, you'll probably hate it. I may get slightly upset if I hear that anyone hates the costumes, though!",5,Understated Beauty,1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,1966,"['loved', 'loved', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'Similar', 'Young', 'Victoria', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'biopic', 'Keats', 'mostly', 'historically', 'accurate', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'romance', 'else', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'whole', 'movie', 'very', 'quiet', 'feel-', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'lot', 'natural', 'light', 'lot', '1995', 'Persuasion', 'realistic', 'look', 'exquisite', 'costumes', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'Even', 'music', 'beautiful', 'quiet', 'are', 'sensual', 'undertones', 'romance', 'movie', 'very', 'restrained', 'heroine', 'usually', 'chaperoned', 'younger', 'siblings', 'sister', 'Toots', 'adorable', 'pair', 'can', 'not', 'marry', 'due', 'poverty', 'then', 'Keats', 'illness', 'Keats', 'friend', 'roommate', 'greasy', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'also', 'prevent', 'romance', 'really', 'only', 'encourage', 'ending', 'tragic', 'Keats', 'died', 'consumption', 'age', '25', 'movie', 'just', 'gorgeous.The', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'cinematography', 'alone', 'Everything', 'understated', 'subtle', 'yet', 'left', 'bigger', 'impression', 'anything', 'grander', 'scale', 'ever', 'has.By', 'far', 'favorite', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'costumes', 'set', 'Regency', 'always', 'plus', 'least', 'love', 'fashions', 'period', 'heroine', 'Fanny', 'seamstress', 'prides', 'fashionable', 'clothes', 'loved', 'clothes', 'actually', 'looked', 'hand-stitched', 'Fanny', 'gowns', 'beginning', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'bright', 'colors', 'big', 'hats', 'collars', 'become', 'more', 'subdued', 'course', 'film', 'Most', 'shoes', 'are', 'really', 'cute', 'too', 'take', 'notice', 'Toots', 'dresses', 'use', 'same', 'fabrics', 'Fanny', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'touch.This', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'like', 'lot', 'action', 'sort', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'hate', 'may', 'get', 'slightly', 'upset', 'hear', 'anyone', 'costumes']",Bright Star

1297450,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B002WY65VA,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[5, 6]","In 2009, Jane Campion's ""Bright Star"" returned her to her gothic romance roots (ala, ""The Piano"" and far away from her desultory ""In the Cut"") in telling the story of John Keats, a 19th century British poet who has a passion-driven love affair with Fanny Brawne, the daughter of a family that is renting a summer house next to the one that Keats' shares.  Andrew Morton wrote a biography of Keats, (""Keats"", in 1997) and Campion drew her pas de deux from the biography, casting only the brief love story of the two that shaped much of Keats' famous poetry.  She set the stage to create again, in ""Bright Star"", what she had captured in ""The Piano"", but this time in the type of chaste love so normal to this period.  Keats, at this time, 3 years prior to his death at 25, is an unknown, a hopeful, a dreamer.  If you have read a Keats poem, you are taken away by his sheer romanticism.  Campion reveals its roots in this film.The film is beautiful.  Campion focuses on her strengths -  the costumes and the incredible cinematography.  The use of wood, of fabrics, of textures, of flowers in the film, is second to none.  There are shots within the film (notably a scene of Fanny Brawne reading one of Keats' letters in a field of blue flowers) that I can truly say took my breath away.She cast relative unknowns for the leads, Ben Whishaw as Keats and Abbie Cornish as Fanny; they both are independent, intellectual, conscious of how closely they match. Whishaw emanates the love of writing and poetry.  Cornish is equally caught up in her fine needlework, confident in her style.  They bring a vitality to the screen, a rare coupling without any frank sex scenes - they are financially conscious and responsible young people, but yet deliciously vibrant in their feelings for each other.  In the showing I attended of the film, couples who appeared to be lovers or mates waited breathlessly in the tender moments; relating to the subtle moments of wanting between the lovers.  (His hand on her hand, both lovers on opposite sides of a single door...) Both actors are impeccable in their roles; or does Campion just get the best from her players?For many, this film will move too slowly and the speaking of some of Keats' poetry will seem mawkish.  Only Charles Brown, (Paul Schneider of ""Lars and the Real Girl"") seems practical - his vulgar dislike of Fanny based on what he sees is ""lightweight"" in her love of fashion and tendency to flirt; and Fanny's mother (Kerry Fox, who starred in one of Campion's earlier films) berates her to find someone who has money or an income, instead of a penniless poet, seem to energize the events.  For me, the beauty of Keats' old fashioned poetry, the subtleness of the romance, the utter happiness of the two together, and the heartbreak of Keats' death in Italy; they all contribute to the visual treat that is this movie, a period piece with incredible depth.  It seems as though Campion may be bypassed in the granting of awards this year, but have no doubt, elements of this film are award-worthy.The DVD has three interesting featurettes and deleted scenes, some of which were more than deserving of being included in the film.  At this point, I don't know if it will be released on Blu-Ray -  as fine a film as any produced in 2009, I hope that ""Bright Star"" (from the Keats poem of the same name) will capture a larger audience on DVD that its limited theater release in the United States allowed.""A thing of beauty is a joy forever""....~John Keats",5,"""Bright Star"" - a film in the romantic tradition of the poet Keats",1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,3497,"['2009', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'Bright', 'Star', 'returned', 'gothic', 'romance', 'roots', 'ala', 'Piano', 'far', 'away', 'desultory', 'Cut', 'telling', 'story', 'John', 'Keats', '19th', 'century', 'British', 'poet', 'who', 'passion-driven', 'love', 'affair', 'Fanny', 'Brawne', 'daughter', 'family', 'renting', 'summer', 'house', 'one', 'Keats', 'shares', 'Andrew', 'Morton', 'wrote', 'biography', 'Keats', 'Keats', '1997', 'Campion', 'drew', 'pas', 'deux', 'biography', 'casting', 'only', 'brief', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'shaped', 'much', 'Keats', 'famous', 'poetry', 'set', 'stage', 'create', 'again', 'Bright', 'Star', 'what', 'had', 'captured', 'Piano', 'time', 'type', 'chaste', 'love', 'so', 'normal', 'period', 'Keats', 'time', '3', 'years', 'prior', 'death', '25', 'unknown', 'hopeful', 'dreamer', 'have', 'read', 'Keats', 'poem', 'are', 'taken', 'away', 'sheer', 'romanticism', 'Campion', 'roots', 'film.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'Campion', 'strengths', 'costumes', 'incredible', 'cinematography', 'use', 'wood', 'fabrics', 'textures', 'flowers', 'film', 'second', 'none', 'are', 'shots', 'film', 'notably', 'scene', 'Fanny', 'Brawne', 'reading', 'one', 'Keats', 'letters', 'field', 'blue', 'flowers', 'can', 'truly', 'say', 'took', 'breath', 'away.She', 'cast', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'leads', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'Keats', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'Fanny', 'are', 'independent', 'intellectual', 'conscious', 'how', 'closely', 'match', 'Whishaw', 'love', 'writing', 'poetry', 'Cornish', 'equally', 'caught', 'up', 'fine', 'needlework', 'confident', 'style', 'bring', 'vitality', 'screen', 'rare', 'coupling', 'frank', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'financially', 'conscious', 'responsible', 'young', 'people', 'yet', 'deliciously', 'vibrant', 'feelings', 'other', 'showing', 'attended', 'film', 'couples', 'who', 'appeared', 'be', 'lovers', 'mates', 'waited', 'breathlessly', 'tender', 'moments', 'relating', 'subtle', 'moments', 'wanting', 'lovers', 'hand', 'hand', 'lovers', 'opposite', 'sides', 'single', 'door', 'actors', 'are', 'impeccable', 'roles', 'Campion', 'just', 'get', 'best', 'players', 'many', 'film', 'will', 'move', 'too', 'slowly', 'speaking', 'Keats', 'poetry', 'will', 'seem', 'mawkish', 'Only', 'Charles', 'Brown', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'practical', 'vulgar', 'dislike', 'Fanny', 'based', 'what', 'lightweight', 'love', 'fashion', 'tendency', 'flirt', 'Fanny', 'mother', 'Kerry', 'Fox', 'who', 'starred', 'one', 'Campion', 'earlier', 'films', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'money', 'income', 'instead', 'penniless', 'poet', 'seem', 'energize', 'events', 'beauty', 'Keats', 'old', 'fashioned', 'poetry', 'subtleness', 'romance', 'utter', 'happiness', 'two', 'together', 'heartbreak', 'Keats', 'death', 'Italy', 'contribute', 'visual', 'treat', 'movie', 'period', 'piece', 'incredible', 'depth', 'Campion', 'may', 'be', 'bypassed', 'granting', 'awards', 'year', 'have', 'doubt', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'award-worthy.The', 'DVD', 'three', 'interesting', 'featurettes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'more', 'deserving', 'being', 'included', 'film', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'Blu-Ray', 'fine', 'film', 'produced', '2009', 'hope', 'Bright', 'Star', 'Keats', 'poem', 'same', 'name', 'will', 'capture', 'larger', 'audience', 'DVD', 'limited', 'theater', 'release', 'United', 'States', 'allowed', 'thing', 'beauty', 'joy', 'forever', '.~John', 'Keats']",Bright Star

We then see that the seamstress is a 20-year old lady sat by a window in the early hours of the morning in her bonnet and ribbons - she is Fanny Brawne (played by Abbie Cornish). Her younger sister Toots (Edie Martin) then wakes up in the bed nearby and sighs at Fanny - Toots may only be 6, but she knows exactly who all the 'just so' work is for...Jane Campion's 2009 re-telling of the mercurial love affair between the struggling English romantic poet John Keats and Fanny Browne has been accused by historians and purists as being historically inaccurate and frankly hogwash. But I feel this is to miss the point. This is a movie - and some artistic allowance is to be expected. But more importantly, Campion absolutely makes it work - and for the whole journey too. You care about these idealistic people - you are enthralled by their short but oh so sweet shot at happiness - and Fanny's destruction at her soulmate's loss is one of the most powerful scenes committed to celluloid in decades.The setting is Hampstead Village, London in 1818 - and Greig Fraser's Cinematography puts huge amounts of detail on screen. This is a world of Inky Quills, Scullery Maids and Pantaloons - where men smoke cigars, gulp brandy and sing chummy Acapella songs for the gathered Ladies and Gentlemen at society parties. A triple-pleated mushroom collar is a clothing advance and a man who is dying of consumption (Keats' brother) is described as 'diminished'.Words are all in this society and Campion's script revels in it. Keats' poems ""Endymion"", ""Bright Star"" and ""When I Have Fears That I May Cease To Be"" are all quoted - and the dialogue inbetween is just as elegant and insightful. But of course the movie lives and dies on the dance of love between Cornish and Whishaw - and that courtship and deepening of feeling features so many great moments... a look she gives Keats in the woods as they walk and exchange ideas, her reaction to Tom's death - create something of beauty to remember him by - an embroidered pillow case that she sat up all night making - her feet curling on a bed as she devours one of Keats love letters - her tender kisses on the paper as she posts her reply... It could all have been so terribly corny, but both the actors and the script give it life and a genuine beating heart. Mark Bradshaw's music is also used sparingly and with great effect - and when it isn't there - the silence engenders a terrible feeling of foreboding (sickness, death).Special mention should also go to Paul Schneider who is exceptional as the arrogant and obsessive Mr. Brown - supposed friend and fellow accomplice in poetry with Keats. Brown does everything to thwart the burgeoning romance between Keats and Brawne - feeling her a distraction from their lofty writing and a danger to his talent - even coveting her as his own. His vehemence forces Keats to step up to the plate and Fanny is well able for him. The core 3 actors here are fabulous together. Special mention should also go to Kerry Fox as Fanny's practical mother and Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Liam Neeson's son in ""Love Actually"") as her younger brother Samuel - also quietly superb.The extras include (a) Working With Jane Campion Documentary (b) Behind The Scenes Featurette (c) Deleted Scenes (d) Photo Gallery and (e) TrailerThe lone subtitle is 'English For The Hearing Impaired'. My only real gripe is that it's not on BLU RAY - a format that would surely make this beauty shine like a diamond (due in 2011 apparently).Campion and her exceptionally talented cast are to be congratulated - ""Bright Star"" is a literate, sensual, beautifully staged and gushingly romantic tale - and proud of it.They did a great job and I for one was deeply moved...PS: the BLU RAY Issue...As you can see from the photo provided by Amazon (UK) - this appears to be a GERMAN issue on BLU RAY - but the copy I received this morning (Dec 2011) is in fact a FRENCH Pathe issue with that language used for all cover artwork.There are 2 audio tracks - 'both' FRENCH and ENGLISH DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. It is obviously defaulted to play in French when you start the disc, but a simple flick of the audio button brings in the English version. The extras on the DVD (including the ""Working With..."" making of) are all intact -  but there are also some totally unrelated Australian Black & White shorts tagged on (God knows why).But the big news is the picture improvement - which at times is simply breathtaking. The outdoor Hampstead scenes, Fanny sowing her garments in her home, Keats lying on top of a tree with its flowering buds beneath him, Fanny walking through a field of bluebells, the child Toots and the cat Topper in her room full of butterflies, the intricate costumes - so many things and scenes are improved - and beautifully so.A gorgeous film made better by BLU RAY.

Campion set out not to out-do prior filmmakers, but to recreate (to fabricate the authenticity if you will) the manner of the times as well as the ethics involved, this without calling attention to her purpose other than through character and by suggestion - even the rumours of presumably scandalous nature are referred to, never uttered.

1297456,A3DTHQIPBY0NI7,B002WY65VA,M. Feldman,"[2, 2]","For many people, ""Bright Star"" will be a solitary pleasure. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this film who did not already know something about the poet John Keats, even if that something is a shadowy remembrance of a Brit Lit survey in college. If you're contemplating acquiring this film, a quick look at an outline of Keats's biography (there are lots of possibilities online) will bring you up to speed. Even so, a drama set in Regency England that details a delicate love affair---well, let's just say that some people near and dear to me would be fast asleep in under ten minutes.I loved ""Bright Star."" The focus of the film is Fanny Brawne, Keats's beloved, not Keats himself, and she is beautifully played by Abbie Cornish, who is anything but ethereal, thank goodness. She is warm and rather bosomy in her high-waisted gowns whose fabrics show the imperfect press of the flat iron and the wrinkles of daily living. (There is even a scene in which her mother is shown ironing.) Sometimes the stitches show too, a reminder that sewing was a creative outlet for Fanny, as it was for many women in this period.The key idea in this film is Keats's love of the sensual, which Fanny comes to share, even though she confesses to not understanding much about poetry. It's no accident that the film maker, Jane Campion, chooses to incorporate lines from  ""Ode to a Nightingale"" from among the famous odes, since any number of scenes in the film are all about yielding to a ""drowsy numbness"" in which ordinary life is suspended and the senses become intensely heightened. Thus, within the domestic, even mundane household interiors of Hampstead interiors, as well as in its fields and parks, butterflies and flowers, birds and music, lush colors and tender kisses, appear and reappear. As Keats tells Fanny when he tries to explain the experience of reading a poem, one does not immediately think of the shore when one jumps in the water; one experiences the water. And so she does, often alone, stretched out on her bed with her eyes shut or dreaming in a corner.Watching a visually gorgeous film like ""Bright Star"" unfold is a bit like reading an ode by Keats.  At the film's end, one is tolled back to reality and remembers: ""Adieu, the fancy cannot cheat so well/As she is famed to do, deceiving elf.""M.

Hard to believe that Keats could be so hide-bound by convention or so undaring.  The film rather peaks in emotion and intensity after the tragic death of Keats' brother Tom.  The emotion expressed by Fanny through the gift of an embroidered pillowslip, on which Tom will lay his head, is effective and heart-rending.After that, things just move along episodically with Keats friend sparring with Fanny possessively for Keats' affection, Keats and Fanny never quite making anything happen time after time and, finally, letting others separate them because of Keats' inability to marry due to lack of funds.  Fanny even allows him, at the height of his illness to be boarded at some flea-bitten hostelry in London rather than keep him at home.  And then allows him to go to Italy where he dies.  I found myself becoming increasingly impatient with their lack of tenacity.

1297465,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002WY65VA,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 5]","As any true romantic will tell you, there's more genuine passion to be found in a love that goes unrequited than in any happily-ever-after ending a writer could come up with.  Certainly, the Romantic poets understood this - and so, too, does Jane Campion, the acclaimed director of ""Sweetie"" and ""The Piano,"" whose exquisitely understated film ""Bright Star"" has as its subject one of the giants of Romantic poetry, John Keats.The movie begins in 1818, when Keats, a young and virtually penniless - though already published - writer meets and falls in love with Fanny Brawne, a woman of some means and family background who prides herself on her way with a needle and her willingness to speak her mind in matters of importance in life.  Though monetary concerns and differences in social standing make a match between them a virtual impossibility, the love between the two becomes the defining force of their beings - be they together or apart, in sickness or in health, in life or in death.  Fanny, we are told, became the inspiration for some of Keats' most beloved works - including ""Bright star, would I as steadfast as thou art,"" a sonnet from which the movie takes its title - and they, along with the letters the lovers wrote to one another over the course of their three-year courtship, provide the main primary sources for Campion`s screenplay (a key secondary source is the biography of Keats by Andrew Motion).  And if the story of Keats and Brawne plays like a romantic novel itself, that's undoubtedly part of what drew Campion to the material in the first place.  In terms of emotional power alone, she clearly knew what she had with this story.Ironically, the most overtly passionate relationship in the film is not the one between the two lovers but the one between Fanny and Charles Armitage Brown, Keats' devoted friend and fellow writer, who jealously guards the poet and his work, and who sees Fanny as a potentially fatal distraction to both the man and his work.  It's hate-at-first-sight for the two of them, with Fanny viewing Brown as little more than a crude, arrogant boor, almost a rival in her love for Keats, and Brown seeing Fanny as a frivolous, flirtatious pseudo-intellectual with nothing of value to contribute to the young genius who seems to have taken such a fancy to her.Unfortunately, many people may avoid seeing this film, in the mistaken belief that, just because it is a high-toned ""costume drama,"" then it must ipso facto be stuffy, inert and boring.  But fear not, for despite its being set in the genteel world of the 19th Century British countryside, this is no tea-and-crumpets, lace-and-doily affair, but rather a profoundly moving glimpse into the intricacies and complexities of the human heart - one where human passions roil just beneath the surface of the drama and where star-crossed lovers cannot be separated even by death itself.Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw are heartbreaking as the two ill-fated lovers, while Paul Schneider, as Brown, fulfils his role of carping naysayer without ever overplaying his hand.The true beauty of ""Bright Star"" lies in how splendidly Campion matches the lyricism of the subject matter with the lyricism of her filmmaking.  With her flawless eye for composition - artfully arranged but never stagy - Campion makes the bucolic setting an integral part of the drama.  The visuals, coupled with a dramatic use of natural sounds and a haunting score by Marc Bradshaw, allow Campion to break free of the bonds of prosaic reality and set the spirits soaring - much as Keats does with his poetry.

I thought the actors who played Fanny and Keats were flat and dull and I really didn't care about their love story nor did I buy that they were so ""passionately"" in love with each other. I thought the scenes moved far too slowly to the point where I was getting bored and starting to fall asleep. This doesn't happen often since I have been able to sit through 4 and 5 hour long period dramas in one sitting without ever feeling bored. Not only did the acting bother me but I thought most of the hair/makeup and costumes were ugly (how on earth did it get nominated for an Oscar?) and they managed to make Abby Cornish, who I can tell is pretty, very frumpy looking in many scenes. Most of the music was weird, especially the opening scene with the weird singing.Overall, don't bother with this movie. It is rare that I watch a period romantic drama that I really really didn't like but this is one of them. Unlikeable and unrelatable characters, boring scenes, flat acting and ugly costumes.

'Bright Star' is a deliberately-paced (perhaps slow to some) almost two hour movie that traces the love affair (as it were) between Keats and Fanny Brawne.  That on-again, off-again relationship was complicated by Keats' rounder of a friend, Mr. Brown.  Brawne and Brown never got along very well, and it was difficult for Keats to manage both of his friends, who so disliked one another.As in any Jane Campion film, the film looks terrific.  Here England is lusciously photographed by cinematographer Greig Fraser.  Campion was able to make England look just as one would expect of the middle-class in 19th century England.  This is a departure from most English period pieces (though Austen sometimes looks as the non-moneyed classes).  One could imagine walking down the street in 'Bright Star' and actually living there.  (As much as I loved 'Brideshead Revisited', I could not imagine being Sebastian or Charles.  Not in that castle.)Moderately Highly Recommended.  The film takes its sweet time to develop to its sad conclusion, and that may disappoint some filmgoers.  Others, such as me, enjoyed the journey, the photography, and the acting.

I think my expectations where a bit high going into this and I was left feeling a bit underwhelmed and indifferent. Bright Star is a beautiful film filled with wonderful, rich colors, lovely costumes and quiet performances.Based on actual characters, it is hard to say what was real and what was not. A few points in the film seemed embellished, mostly to do with the actual extent of the relationship between Ben Whishaw's character and Abbie Cornish's character. This being the early 1800's, I found it a tad difficult to believe their relationship was allowed certain liberties, especially with Cornish's mother constantly around and pretty informed of all that went on. Again, who is to say what really happened but it almost seemed unrealistic for that particular time period.The performaces themselves where subtle, though effective. Ben Whishaw as John Keats was the more understated of the 2 leads and I found his character to be the more indifferent one in the relationship. Cornish as Fanny Brawne was more passionate but again, she seemed almost too 'modern' and forward for the time period. Their budding relationship starts almost suddenly and seemingly out of the blue, or at least that is how I perceived it. I found their connection genuine in some instances and bland the next.Bright Star is a slow-moving film and a bit confusing in the beginning and may not be for everyone, even those who love Period films, as I do. While I ended up liking it, I can say that I certainly wasn't in love with it by any means. Again, I think I wanted to love it so badly and it didn't meet my expectations, sadly. The ending was very touching and felt very genuine and perhaps, oddly, the best part of the film. There is nothing better than a drama done right and the latter part of the film was certainly proof of that.Bright Star is an uneven film at times and though not perfect by any means, is still worth watching for those desperately in love with the genre.",3,Slow-paced and subtle,1265241600,"02 4, 2010",2010,2056,"['wanted', 'adore', 'Bright', 'Star', 'especially', 'reading', 'wonderful', 'sounding', 'reviews', 'think', 'expectations', 'where', 'bit', 'high', 'going', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'bit', 'underwhelmed', 'indifferent', 'Bright', 'Star', 'beautiful', 'film', 'filled', 'wonderful', 'rich', 'colors', 'lovely', 'costumes', 'quiet', 'performances.Based', 'actual', 'characters', 'hard', 'say', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'what', 'was', 'not', 'few', 'points', 'film', 'seemed', 'embellished', 'mostly', 'do', 'actual', 'extent', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'character', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'character', 'being', 'early', '1800', 'found', 'tad', 'difficult', 'believe', 'relationship', 'was', 'allowed', 'certain', 'liberties', 'especially', 'Cornish', 'mother', 'constantly', 'pretty', 'informed', 'went', 'Again', 'who', 'say', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'almost', 'seemed', 'unrealistic', 'particular', 'time', 'period.The', 'performaces', 'where', 'subtle', 'though', 'effective', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'John', 'Keats', 'was', 'more', 'understated', '2', 'leads', 'found', 'character', 'be', 'more', 'indifferent', 'one', 'relationship', 'Cornish', 'Fanny', 'Brawne', 'was', 'more', 'passionate', 'again', 'seemed', 'almost', 'too', ""'modern"", 'forward', 'time', 'period', 'budding', 'relationship', 'almost', 'suddenly', 'seemingly', 'blue', 'least', 'how', 'perceived', 'found', 'connection', 'genuine', 'instances', 'bland', 'next.Bright', 'Star', 'slow-moving', 'film', 'bit', 'confusing', 'beginning', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'even', 'who', 'love', 'Period', 'films', 'do', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'can', 'say', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'love', 'means', 'Again', 'think', 'wanted', 'love', 'so', 'badly', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'expectations', 'sadly', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'felt', 'very', 'genuine', 'perhaps', 'oddly', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'nothing', 'better', 'drama', 'done', 'right', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'proof', 'that.Bright', 'Star', 'uneven', 'film', 'times', 'not', 'perfect', 'means', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'desperately', 'love', 'genre']",Bright Star
1297473,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B002WY65VA,Westley,"[3, 4]","""Bright Star"" tells of the love story between Romantic poet John Keats (Ben Whishaw) and his neighbor, Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish).  Brawne is a bit younger than Keats and at first doesn't know much about poetry; instead, her ""art"" is designing and sewing her own clothes.  Their affair was largely unknown until after their deaths, when their love letters were published.  The pair were engaged for several years before Keats' death by consumption, and this period corresponds with the writing of some of his most successful poems.  As with many great love stories, this one is about the inability of the two to be together.  For Keats did not have an income and relied on the kindness of fellow writers, including Charles Brown (Paul Schneider), who dislikes the flirtatious Brawne and the attention she takes Keats' writing.Director Jane Campion has done some amazing period pieces in the past, including the glorious ""The Piano"" (1993).  Unfortunately, she got off-track a bit with ""Holy Smoke!"" (1999) and the dismal ""In the Cut"" (2003).  Thus, ""Bright Star"" marks a stunning return to form and arguably her best film since ""The Piano.""  What I loved most about this movie is how alive it feels; it's not a stodgy period piece that is overly reverential to its subjects.  Keats and Brawne are just two crazy, mixed-up kids in love.  At the same time, the movie doesn't veer too far into syrupy romance, even though one of the protagonists is a poet.  Keats' poetry is featured at times but not enough to scare away poetry-phobes.  Campion really does a lovely job of balancing all aspects of this story, making ""Bright Star"" likely to appeal to fans of Keats' poetry as well as many other types of audiences.This movie is also one of the most beautiful films set in 1800s England.  The costumes are gorgeous and completely realistic for an upper-middle-class English family.  The scenery and set designs are also stunning without being ostentatious.  Finally, the acting is very good.  American Paul Schnieder (Parks and Recreation) is particularly good as the dour, teasing Brown.

Of course it's all the more poignant & bittersweet for lasting so short a time ... but isn't that the beauty of the cherry blossom, falling & fading so quickly? And for being such chaste love in this case, it beautifully expresses the physicality of the emotions: the tightness in the throat, the quickening of the heart, the exquisite pain of longing & desire. For those who've experienced these feelings, the film will make you relive them all over again!The look of the film is lovely & fresh, with a certain roughhewn quality to the everyday background of life, and a lushness to the details.

But then, nothing is mundane when you're in that state -- everything is charged with unbearably piercing meaning, isn't it? The slightest gesture, the most trivial incident: all speak feverish volumes.The fact that it's a true story makes it even more moving. The bitter irony of Keats' certainty of his failure, without knowing that he was destined to become one of the immortals of poetry, is like a poisoned arrow. But this is really Fanny Brawne's story, told from her perspective -- and Abbie Cornish is excellent in the role. She knows when to be subtle, barely betraying the storm beneath the surface; she knows when to be embarrassingly raw, utterly naked in her anguish.If you want to understand what's meant by Romantic, this is the film that embodies it -- most highly recommended!",5,First & last love,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,1787,"['was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'Bright', 'Star', 'Having', 'seen', 'last', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'quiet', 'power', 'equally', 'tender', 'passionate', 'truly', 'capturing', 'essence', 'finding', 'one', 'special', 'love', 'life', 'course', 'more', 'poignant', 'bittersweet', 'lasting', 'so', 'short', 'time', ""n't"", 'beauty', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'falling', 'fading', 'so', 'quickly', 'being', 'such', 'chaste', 'love', 'case', 'beautifully', 'physicality', 'emotions', 'tightness', 'throat', 'quickening', 'heart', 'exquisite', 'pain', 'longing', 'desire', 'who', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'feelings', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'relive', 'over', 'again', 'look', 'film', 'lovely', 'fresh', 'certain', 'roughhewn', 'quality', 'everyday', 'background', 'life', 'lushness', 'details', 'think', 'very', 'accurately', 'way', 'first', 'love', 'brings', 'everything', 'intense', 'focus', 'making', 'almost', 'too', 'sensitive', 'even', 'most', 'mundane', 'aspects', 'world', 'then', 'nothing', 'mundane', 'when', ""'re"", 'state', 'everything', 'charged', 'unbearably', 'piercing', 'meaning', ""n't"", 'slightest', 'gesture', 'most', 'trivial', 'incident', 'speak', 'feverish', 'volumes.The', 'fact', 'true', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'moving', 'bitter', 'irony', 'Keats', 'certainty', 'failure', 'knowing', 'was', 'destined', 'become', 'one', 'immortals', 'poetry', 'poisoned', 'arrow', 'really', 'Fanny', 'Brawne', 'story', 'told', 'perspective', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'excellent', 'role', 'when', 'be', 'subtle', 'barely', 'betraying', 'storm', 'surface', 'when', 'be', 'embarrassingly', 'raw', 'utterly', 'naked', 'anguish.If', 'want', 'understand', 'what', 'meant', 'Romantic', 'film', 'most', 'highly', 'recommended']",Bright Star
1297476,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002WY65VA,Z Hayes,"[4, 5]","This is a movie that romantics will savor over and over - and the fact that it is based on the true love story between Romantic poet John Keats and his muse, Fanny Brawne, makes it all the more riveting. In director Jane Campion's able hands, ""Bright Star"" is a perfect blend of poetry and passion. Ben Whishaw plays the young poet John Keats who falls hard for Fanny Brawne (Abby Cornish), the spirited and talented daughter (she sews beautifully) of a widow (Kerry Fox) who along with two younger children live in Hampstead Village, North London. Keats and his friend and patron Charles Brown (Paul Schneider) take a room in the house where Fanny and her family live, and a slow attraction develops between Brawne and Keats which eventually consumes them in full force. The beauty of it all is that this passion is not so much physical but something that transcends the flesh - this is a couple that due to the conventions of the day (Keats realizes the hopelessness of his situation for his lack of finances makes him an unworthy suitor) where propriety and maintaining a girl's respectability were highly prized makes physical intimacy almost an impossibility.Despite this, Fanny and Keats are able to show us how very real their affection and love for each other is - they read poetry to each other, finishing each other's lines, exchange soulful looks, the most tender, feather-light kisses, and all these amidst a gorgeous backdrop of lush fields of flowers, butterflies, etc. There is a strong sense of sexual energy - most evident in a bedroom scene where Fanny and Keats, fully attired recite poetry to one another! The one spoke in this relationship is Charles Brown (well-played by Paul Schneider) who resents Fanny's monopoly of Keat's attention, jealous of their intimacy and his inability to break this close bond, though he tries mightily to do so. In a fit of pure malice, Brown says of Fanny, ""She can't speak, because she only knows how to flirt and sew."" To Brown, Fanny is like a pesky gnat, an irritant that won't go away. The jibes shared between Fanny and Brown are actually one of the film's highlights, with an energy of their own, and makes for an interesting contrast to the tender interludes between Fanny and Keats.As I watched ""Bright Star"", I felt like I was watching the real characters come to life - Whishaw and Cornish breathe so much life into their roles and I was reminded of a line from Keat's poem, ""A thing of beauty is a joy forever."" ""Bright Star"" certainly is a thing of beauty to be treasured and appreciated for a long time to come. The DVD sadly lacks interesting bonus features - trailers for various movies, a deleted scene ""I'll Wait"", and three featurettes which are basically very brief interviews with the director, i.e. ""Becoming Keats and Fanny"", ""Setting the Scene"", and ""An Inspiring Romance"". I wish there had been a director's commentary, a making-of segment, and also interviews with the cast.",5,Stirring and incredibly touching,1264550400,"01 27, 2010",2010,2954,"['movie', 'romantics', 'will', 'savor', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'love', 'story', 'Romantic', 'poet', 'John', 'Keats', 'muse', 'Fanny', 'Brawne', 'more', 'riveting', 'director', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'able', 'hands', 'Bright', 'Star', 'perfect', 'blend', 'poetry', 'passion', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'young', 'poet', 'John', 'Keats', 'who', 'hard', 'Fanny', 'Brawne', 'Abby', 'Cornish', 'spirited', 'talented', 'daughter', 'beautifully', 'widow', 'Kerry', 'Fox', 'who', 'two', 'younger', 'children', 'live', 'Hampstead', 'Village', 'North', 'London', 'Keats', 'friend', 'patron', 'Charles', 'Brown', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'take', 'room', 'house', 'where', 'Fanny', 'family', 'live', 'slow', 'attraction', 'Brawne', 'Keats', 'eventually', 'full', 'force', 'beauty', 'passion', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'physical', 'something', 'flesh', 'couple', 'due', 'conventions', 'day', 'Keats', 'hopelessness', 'situation', 'lack', 'finances', 'unworthy', 'suitor', 'where', 'propriety', 'maintaining', 'girl', 'respectability', 'were', 'highly', 'prized', 'physical', 'intimacy', 'almost', 'impossibility.Despite', 'Fanny', 'Keats', 'are', 'able', 'show', 'how', 'very', 'real', 'affection', 'love', 'other', 'read', 'poetry', 'other', 'finishing', 'other', 'lines', 'exchange', 'soulful', 'looks', 'most', 'tender', 'feather-light', 'kisses', 'gorgeous', 'backdrop', 'lush', 'fields', 'flowers', 'butterflies', 'etc', 'strong', 'sense', 'sexual', 'energy', 'most', 'evident', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'where', 'Fanny', 'Keats', 'fully', 'attired', 'recite', 'poetry', 'one', 'one', 'spoke', 'relationship', 'Charles', 'Brown', 'well-played', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'who', 'Fanny', 'monopoly', 'Keat', 'attention', 'jealous', 'intimacy', 'inability', 'break', 'close', 'bond', 'mightily', 'do', 'so', 'fit', 'pure', 'malice', 'Brown', 'Fanny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'only', 'how', 'flirt', 'sew', 'Brown', 'Fanny', 'pesky', 'gnat', 'irritant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'jibes', 'shared', 'Fanny', 'Brown', 'are', 'actually', 'one', 'film', 'highlights', 'energy', 'own', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'tender', 'interludes', 'Fanny', 'Keats.As', 'watched', 'Bright', 'Star', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'real', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'Whishaw', 'Cornish', 'breathe', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'roles', 'was', 'reminded', 'line', 'Keat', 'poem', 'thing', 'beauty', 'joy', 'forever', 'Bright', 'Star', 'certainly', 'thing', 'beauty', 'be', 'treasured', 'appreciated', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'DVD', 'sadly', 'interesting', 'bonus', 'features', 'trailers', 'various', 'movies', 'deleted', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'Wait', 'three', 'featurettes', 'are', 'basically', 'very', 'brief', 'interviews', 'director', 'i.e', 'Becoming', 'Keats', 'Fanny', 'Setting', 'Scene', 'Inspiring', 'Romance', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'director', 'commentary', 'making-of', 'segment', 'also', 'interviews', 'cast']",Bright Star
