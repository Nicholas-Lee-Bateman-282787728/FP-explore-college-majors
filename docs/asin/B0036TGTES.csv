And as a fan of the show owning this season is just wrong.  They got rid of Jim Gaffigan, denied the actors playing PJ & Bobby jobs on real network tv, then bought in the fabulous Rachel Harris only to cancel it.  To make matters worse this season's ""start"" really wasn't up to the previous seasons so again no reason to buy this.  I knew this was the last season but what a crummy way to go out.  I'm giving it 2 stars out of sentimentality it really only deserves 1.",2,Booooooooo!,1284422400,"09 14, 2010",2010,570,"['Renewing', 'show', 'then', 'canceling', '9', 'episodes', 'then', 'asking', 'full', 'season', 'price', 'crazy', 'fan', 'show', 'owning', 'season', 'just', 'wrong', 'got', 'rid', 'Jim', 'Gaffigan', 'denied', 'actors', 'playing', 'PJ', 'Bobby', 'jobs', 'real', 'network', 'tv', 'then', 'bought', 'fabulous', 'Rachel', 'Harris', 'only', 'cancel', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'season', 'start', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'previous', 'seasons', 'so', 'again', 'reason', 'buy', 'knew', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'what', 'crummy', 'way', 'go', 'out', ""'m"", 'giving', '2', 'sentimentality', 'really', 'only', '1']",N/A

TBS could never fully commit to the show.  The final season doesn't live up to the great first three seasons mainly because of the departure of Jim Gaffigan.  His presence is desperately missed especially during the poker games where a lot of the shows best banter happened.  I agree that the price is a bit steep for the number of episodes, but despite not living up to prior seasons, Season Four still has its moments and is funnier that a lot of other shows that have had longer lives.",3,Misses Gaffigan,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,616,"['Boys', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'TBS', 'never', 'got', 'recognition', 'deserved', 'especially', 'channel', 'broadcast', 'TBS', 'could', 'never', 'fully', 'commit', 'show', 'final', 'season', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'great', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'mainly', 'departure', 'Jim', 'Gaffigan', 'presence', 'desperately', 'missed', 'especially', 'poker', 'games', 'where', 'lot', 'shows', 'best', 'banter', 'happened', 'agree', 'price', 'bit', 'steep', 'number', 'episodes', 'not', 'living', 'up', 'prior', 'seasons', 'Season', 'Four', 'still', 'moments', 'funnier', 'lot', 'other', 'shows', 'have', 'had', 'longer', 'lives']",N/A
