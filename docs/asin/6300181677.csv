200204,AI3QBELSAE39K,6300181677,"Amazon Customer ""xcasto""","[4, 6]","Loved this movie as a kid at it was the driving force for me ordering it. The other reviews gave this item high praise and made me feel comfortable enough to pay Amazon's price.This item's details include:- Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1 perspective- English Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono audio- Quality packaging (this is actually a reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2).That's it folks... It has NO menus, NO Subtitles or Closed Captions, NO other languages, NO Extras and the video quality is somewhere around that of a New VHS Tape.  Because it is a (Single Layer) DVD-R there may be some playback problems on different devices.If you LOVE this movie then I suggest you get this item (it is an Amazon Exclusive after all) for it does have a feature for you... It is designed to continuously play so it can be enjoyed for days on end.  But if you're like me, you won't be happy spending more than five dollars for a movie that doesn't have basic DVD details like menus, subtitles and/or some extras (regardless of how nice the packaging looks)...Thanks Amazon for the movie, but I doubt I'll buy anymore from the ""Vault Series"" at the price you're asking.",3,A High Quality Bootleg From An Approved Source,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,1150,"['Loved', 'movie', 'kid', 'was', 'driving', 'force', 'ordering', 'other', 'reviews', 'gave', 'item', 'high', 'praise', 'made', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'pay', 'Amazon', 'price.This', 'item', 'details', 'include', 'Anamorphic', 'Widescreen', '1.85:1', 'perspective-', 'English', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'Mono', 'audio-', 'Quality', 'packaging', 'actually', 'reason', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'instead', '2', 'NO', 'menus', 'NO', 'Subtitles', 'Closed', 'Captions', 'NO', 'other', 'languages', 'NO', 'Extras', 'video', 'quality', 'somewhere', 'New', 'VHS', 'Tape', 'Single', 'Layer', 'DVD-R', 'may', 'be', 'playback', 'problems', 'different', 'devices.If', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'then', 'suggest', 'get', 'item', 'Amazon', 'Exclusive', 'have', 'feature', 'designed', 'continuously', 'play', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'days', 'end', ""'re"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'spending', 'more', 'five', 'dollars', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'basic', 'DVD', 'details', 'menus', 'and/or', 'extras', 'regardless', 'how', 'nice', 'packaging', 'Thanks', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'anymore', 'Vault', 'Series', 'price', ""'re"", 'asking']",N/A

My only reference to Marty Feldman was his work in Mel Brooks' films notably his memorable turn as Igor in ""Young Frankenstein"".  Since then I've become a fan of British comedy notably the work of Alec Guiness and Peter Sellers as well as the output of the Ealing Studios.  Viewing this film in a different light Brooks' influence is most definitely present but it's steeped very much in the British tradition with the Goons coming to mind.  This is not to say that Feldman doesn't leave his own personalized stamp here.  The film is a hodge-podge of verbal and visual gags and amusing slapstick.  Some of it works and some of it doesn't.  Feldman was taken from us prematurely directing only one other feature, ""In God We Trust"" which wasn't received well critically or commercially.

The story of twin brothers - Marty Feldman and Michael York - who end up in the French Foreign Legion, it's hysterical. Feldman is incredible with his comedic delivery, physical comedy, and directing. ""The Escape"" scene is five minutes long and funnier than most entire movies. Immediately after watching this I looked up some of Feldman's British shows and they're just as funny. This movie has it all - brilliant wordplay, intelligent parody, and some outstanding slapstick. If you're a fan of Monty Python or Mel Brooks you will love this movie. It's easy to see where the Pythons got their training after watching Feldman at work.
