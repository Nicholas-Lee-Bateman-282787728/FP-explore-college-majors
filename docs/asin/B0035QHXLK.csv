Great melodrama starring Lindsay Wagner, Barry Bostwick, Marie~France Pisier, Kim Cattrall, Gavin MacLeod, and Gene Tierney in her final role.Wonderful 'soap', from the book that scandalized Hollywood, Judith Krantz.  The movie is engrossing and filled with wonderful interiors.  Not to be missed are the furnishings, still 'in situ' at the old Hilda Boldt Weber/Conrad Hilton estate, which were designed in the 1930's by TH Robsjohn~Gibbings.

I was leery at first of buying DVD-R because, as a rule, they are easy to scratch and generally more fragile than glass pressed, mass produced DVD's.  Sadly, my fears were realized when my copy of 'Scruples' arrived and disc one started stalling and skipping half way through.  Indeed, it seemed to be scratched (even though it was a NEW copy).  So, I am sending it back and getting another one.  My other fear was quality, but this was quickly dispelled.  Read on.I have to say that other than the technical difficulty, the quality of this DVD is excellent. Video is crisp and sharp and sound is good (for a mono 1980 miniseries).  The series itself stands the test of time and is as good as always.  Of course, we're talking Judith Krantz, so it is as sappy and cheesy as you can expect it to be.  The discs themselves are professionally produced, with great artwork and printing both on disc and keepcase.Something else I would like to point out. That Warner Bros. is releasing titles 'on demand' on DVD-R seems to be the answer for a dwindling economy, which would otherwise see many of these titles never released.  I applaud Warner Bros. for taking this route.  I wish SONY would take the hint and use this method to release TV series that they release one season of and then never release the rest due to less than multi-million dollar sales.  With this 'on demand' system, everyone wins (especially the customer).

I was appalled when I read the review, thinking that Lotte had mis-judged the series.  I do not own ""Scruples"" on dvd yet.  But I do have the original VHS copy, and I also have a personal copy of my own which I had watched so many times until the product became worn.  Lotte, I really do believe you've over-looked something fundamental when viewing the dvd. ""Scruples"" has always been a superb piece of '80's drama, and having Lindsay Wagner at the helm of the production vehicle was a superb choice.  I have always regarded her as the quinessential queen of the '80's mini-series.  And I only wish the television moguls would re-consider bringing back the mini-series before reality t.v. completely takes over the spectrum.Lotte, please give the dvd another once-over.  I'm sure there are some things you've missed.  Or maybe you were viewing on a bad day.

At some point, years later I bought the DVD and I finally got around to watching it. It started out OK, and the lead character, Billie, was a nice girl with good morals, etc., but didn't move along as I remembered it.  Billie changes. For instance, after her very rich, and much older but beloved husband dies, she hires a helicopter where she throws his ashes in the sea.  When she gets back, innocent Billy (up to now) initiates sex with the pilot. Already I'm confused. The story was exasperating, and I kept fast forwarding it to see if it got any better. It didn't. With a couple of exceptions, most of the players were trashy.  The story had no humor, and no character. To make it worse it highlighted murder, rape, wealthy and/or neurotic Hollywood characters, many of them crooks.I saw several actors I'd seen in other TV shows. (Much better ones)  MTM (Mary's dad, Murrey from MTM, Lindsay Wagner from Paper Chase (the film), Kim Cattrail (Paper Chase,(the TV version), Sex and the City)and others.

1326866,A135WQ77OCZID7,B0035QHXLK,"Perry R. Johnson ""Perry R. Johnson""","[3, 3]","For years, I have been curious about ""Scruples"". It has been advertised as one of Lindsay Wagner's best tv movies and as legendary Gene Tierney's last video performance. For 1980, this movie was considered scandelous. However, in the new ages of violent music videos, terrorists, and a non innocence society, this is tame. Lindsay Wagner, as usual, is a gifted actress. Barry Bostwick and Marie-France Piser are great as the secondary story line as two people, who are in love, but don't know how to commit to each other. Guest appearences include Connie Stevens, Robert Reed, Gavin MacLeod, and Kim Cattrall. This is a factory of stars, who guest starred on ""Love Boat"" and ""Charlie's Angels"". After reading the facts on the stars, I noticed under Lindsay Wagner's biography that she was in an auto accident, which gave her a scar above her upper lip. It is evident here. However, she is nevertheless beautiful. Marie-France Fimer is a striking sexy but Carole Lombard type beauty, who gives an excellent performance. She is sexy and wise cracking like Lombard. Unfortunately, I read she died recently this year in a pool accident. God bless her soul. Barry Bostwick is also good in a not conviencing hustler role. He makes the audience like him in the long run. As for the most surprising role, it goes to legendary Gene Tierney, who played in ""Laura"", ""Leave Her To Heaven"" and ""The Raxor's Edge"". Gene Tierney was known to be one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. In this movie, it is a sad reminder that time takes it toll. Gene is overweight and looks more like 70 by today's standard than 59 or 60, when she made this. The eyes are still as beautiful, when she first made movies and in my opinion, more beautiful than Elizabeth Taylor's. However, she gives a great brief short performance as a latent lesbian, who is overwhelmed with Kim Cattrall's beauty. This appearence was shortly made after Gene Tierney's bestseller autobiography. One, guesses, she did this to help promote the book. Anyway, Gene's performance makes you believe she was lusty after Kim Cattrall. Buy this DVD. It is one to have in your collection. This makes me want to buy more Lindsay Wagner t.v. or movie performances.
