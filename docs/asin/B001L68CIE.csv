During the virtual driving test, the car following the driver signals to turn left but when questioned on the test the correct answer is given as the driver was turning right.  This confused me and I reviewed that part three times.  I went to my own mirror and emulated the turn for myself and the video is in error.Think of it this way, the car trailing behind you is facing the same direction you are, not the opposite direction, ""wysiwyg-what you see is what you get"" in the rearview mirror.",2,"Fatal flaw in our copy, could be dangerous to a less competent driver...",1320192000,"11 2, 2011",2011,583,"['major', 'flaw', 'copy', 'video', 'checked', 'out', 'local', 'library', 'virtual', 'driving', 'test', 'car', 'following', 'driver', 'signals', 'turn', 'left', 'when', 'questioned', 'test', 'correct', 'answer', 'given', 'driver', 'was', 'turning', 'right', 'confused', 'reviewed', 'part', 'three', 'times', 'went', 'own', 'mirror', 'emulated', 'turn', 'video', 'error.Think', 'way', 'car', 'trailing', 'facing', 'same', 'direction', 'are', 'not', 'opposite', 'direction', 'wysiwyg-what', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'rearview', 'mirror']",Rules of the Road  Set: Interactive Driver's Ed Course
