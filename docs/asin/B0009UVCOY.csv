It details the efforts of one woman to provide a safe haven for her and her daughter, and the lengths her husband will take to keep her in his control.  This movie has a lot of twists and turns, and it keeps the viewer involved.

Mcgorm ""tiddles""","[8, 8]","This is an absolute treasure for movie watchers and collectors as well as its based on a true story of women who are abused in marriages and I,m glad i brought this dvd. Many would not know what it is like to be in the same situation or where to turn and for that mother I really feel for, More movies of both sexes as it happens to men that get abused as well should be told and maybe society should be made more aware of this instead of it be hidden like it has been for years. Maybe with this type of thing going on the abuser will stop and think better before acting in temper. The story line could not have been better and the acting was not overdone.

913361,A21M3YYEERMG3D,B0009UVCOY,Sherrie H,"[0, 0]","The story of a battered woman and I imagine the story of a lot of battered women. First there's the stepmother who couldn't understand the problem but the father understood and was ready to kill the husband played by Corbin Berson (sp?). From shelter to shelter to shelter, to live in fear every day, to watch your back, I can't imagine living that kind of life.  One day my husband threw me across the room during an argument and then cornered me in the bathroom and started pinching me (hurt like hell). The next day I called my lawyer dad and asked him to start divorce papers. I was scared, afraid, concerned (I had a daughter under two) but I wasn't going to stick around and let this get any further. He left, my life changed for the better, got a job and lived a normal happy life until I met the man of my dreams (32 years wed). So there is hope ladies-don't put up with this sh.t--get out while the gettin's good-at the first time of violence. You'll be glad you did. I don't mean to make light of the situation as in this story but there are options, underground shelters, family who may help.....just get out and get help; it's out there!!!
