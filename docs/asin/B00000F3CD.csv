497369,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00000F3CD,Anthony L.,"[1, 1]","Tight, lean, cynical, economical, and hard-hitting, Following is one of those movies that gains recognition because the then-unknown people who made it went on to greater fame.Is it the greatest neo noir of all time? No. Is it an all-time classic; one of Christopher Nolan's best films? Again, no. Is it a razor sharp and brutally effective, slick and gritty neo-noir that accomplishes it's twisting message through understated acting and sharp dialogue? Yes. Does it show the brimming talent that Nolan would show later in films likeMementoandThe Dark Knight? Absolutely.In Following, we see a lot of tropes and themes that can be seen in the later films of Christopher Nolan: the non-linear narrative (Memento, The Prestige), the black-and-white (Memento), the unreliable narrator (Memento, Inception), the voiceovers (Memento...again), and the tight editing, smart scripts, and gritty cinematography of his later, bigger budgeted films.The small budget is Following's biggest flaw. It's budget is practically non-existent, and it shows onscreen. Nolan and Co. do their best to mask the fact, and the production values are high, but this movie would not suffer at all from bigger financing.Still, a very impressive debut. With a tight, mind-bending, effective neo-noir scirpt, a brilliant performance from Jeremy Theobald (See: Doodlebug), and a slick score from David Julyan, Following is a dark, gritty, mind-bending, thought-provoking, and lean, mean debut from one of the 21st Century's great directors.

497376,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00000F3CD,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 3]","Following is the one of the cleverest, smartest, toughest psychological thrillers since...well...since Memento. Bill (Jeremy Theobald) is an unsuccessful wannabe writer. ""I've been on my own for a while,"" he tells an older man at the beginning of the movie, ""and getting kind of lonely...and bored...nothing to do all day. And that's when I started shadowing."" Bill will pick out a person and spend the day secretly following them around, seeing what they do and who they meet, what their lives are like. Fate, or something more sinister, takes a hand when he follows Cobb (Alex Haw) one day...and Cobb confronts him in a cafe. Cobb is about Bill's age, but he's smart and assured. And a thief. He breaks into people's flats and takes things, not just for the money. He convinces Bill, almost in a seduction, to follow him around while he does this. Bill is torn between fascination and unease, and fascination wins. Cobb explains to him that ""interrupting someone's life is what it's all about. Making them see all the things they take for granted."" One night Bill meets an attractive blond (Lucy Russell) in a nightclub owned by her boyfriend, an older, ruthless criminal who deals in drugs and pornography. As their relationship develops, so does his relationship with Cobb. Cobb may not be the best guy around to trust. Maybe not Lucy, either.You might think the movie is a linear neo-noir until you realize that while some scenes are not in a linear context, they still provide clues to what's happening to Bill. In one scene he may be scruffy. In another scene more-or-less well groomed. He may have a bruise the size of a fist on his cheek with a white rubber glove stuffed in his mouth; in the next scene, no bruise, no glove. The scenes aren't in any chronological context, but they aren't random, either. They're great as a way to cleverly capture your attention and to make you suspicious of what you're seeing and of what seems to be happening. We realize Bill's story is a lot more complicated than we think, and that Bill's version doesn't seem likely to be the only version. The conclusion makes absolute sense when we look back at everything, and it is totally unexpected.Nolan, who made Memento three years after Following, is a master at cleverly moving around pieces of a puzzle. If Memento was close to being a masterpiece of indirection, Following shows Memento wasn't a lucky one-shot. The movie, according to IMDb, was shot on a budget of about $6,000 on weekends. The cast and crew were friends, coworkers and relatives. It doesn't look like the work of amateurs at all. This is a fully professional film. The cast, incidentally, does an outstanding job. Only Russell seems to have gone on to a professional acting career. Theobald captures the feel of a person who doesn't just follow, but is essentially a follower. And Alex Haw as Cobb brings to the role all the competent, assured superciliousness of a young Rupert Everett, and that's intended as a compliment.The movie was shot full frame and the DVD transfer looks just fine. There are a number of extras that fans of Nolan will most likely find of interest, including a Nolan commentary. For people who can't stand puzzles, one of the extras includes the ability to restructure the story chronologically.",5,You'll Need To Pay Attention With This One.

497378,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00000F3CD,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[1, 3]","After watching Following (1998) last night, I've determined that writer/director Christopher Nolan, who would later do the immensely popular film Memento (2000), is either a raving psychotic, mad genius, or possibly equal parts of both (I'll elaborate more on this later).  Appearing in the film is Jeremy Theobald, who appeared in Nolan's first feature short, Doodlebug (1997), Lucy Russell, who is going to appear in Nolan's take on the Gotham Knight in 2005's Batman Begins, and Alex Haw, who has no other credits, which is too bad as I thought he did very well here.Theobald plays Bill, an aspiring writer (i.e. the starving artist type...you know him...greasy, unkempt, living in a shabby apartment subsisting off macaroni and ketchup...or is it catsup?  I guess it doesn't matter) whose curiosities have developed into a rather odd compulsion of picking people out of the crowd, randomly, and following them with no other reason than to see where they go...I guess it beats working.  Anyway, after Bill gets caught `doing his thing' by one of his subjects, a slick, smartly dressed man named Cobb (Haw), he learns the man is a burglar, the two develop a sort of partnership, and Bill begins tagging along with Cobb (who seems to have an awful lot of insight about those who he robs), supposedly to gather information for his writing...but soon Bill finds himself not only learning, but participating, using the tricks of the trade taught to him as Cobb becomes the mentor, Bill the student.  Bill also becomes involved with the occupant of one of the flats the two have burglarized, a pretty blonde woman (Russell) with a somewhat shady past and a penchant for manipulation.  So what happens next?  Well, let's just say once you begin your downward decent, regardless of the illicit activity, the momentum generally takes hold and becomes a force of its' own, and not stopping until confronted with an immovable object, in this case, rock bottom.So what the heck did I mean when I referred earlier to Nolan's mental state?  The story seems pretty straightforward, from the way I described it, right?  If you've seen the film Memento, you'll have a better understanding about what I'm talkin' about, Willis.  The story is straightforward, when played in the linear, chronological sense, but that's not the case here.  The film begins in the present, with the Bill relating his story to what appears to be a police detective, and then bounces between three different timeframes, the past, the not so distance past, and the present, highlighted by noticeable physical changes in Bill (hairstyles, facial hair, distinguishing bruises and cuts on his face...Bill gets the beating at one point).  Now, this might make the story sound confusing and hard to follow, but I didn't think so as Nolan seemed to know exactly how to best put things in the order without actually putting them back in order (if that makes sense).  As I said before, he does allow for variances to become the key indicators between the various timeframes, so if you're paying attention, you shouldn't have problems keeping up.  The story, when told in chronological order, is actually pretty simplistic, but Nolan manages to complicate things just enough to keep you in the dark right up until the end.  It is strange how much different the same story can play out depending on how it's told.  As I said, Nolan seems to be able to extract the most out of his skewed chronology of events, heightening the tension greatly.  The whole notion of understanding a story enough to completely tear it apart, re-assembling it in a completely different fashion, ultimately getting the same ending though a different route, and doing it successfully, is amazing.  The film, which was shot in black and white, is kept minimal (i.e. sparse) in nearly all aspects (script, story, characters, etc.), and runs lean and mean with a runtime of about 70 minutes.  There seems little, if anything, in the film that was unnecessary, so there's little to distract from the story.  Bottom line is if you're interested in a sharp, smartly paced film that wastes little and requires a bit of thought from its' viewer, Following won't disappoint.The full screen picture (aspect ratio 1.33:1) looks gritty, serving to give the film a `noir-ish' quality, which accentuates the story well.  The 2.0 Dolby stereo is adequate, but there are English subtitles if you have difficulty hearing all the dialogue.  There are a whole slew of extras including commentary by director Nolan, the ability to reconstruct the film into chronological order, theatrical trailers for this film and Memento, second angles with the director's shooting script, along with cast and crew biographies.

announced Tim Burton was going to do a Batman film way back in 1989, and that didn't turn out too bad.Cookieman108",4,You're Never Alone.,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,5033,"['watching', 'Following',

He doesn't just follow women, he points out.  He's not a stalker, as such.  He's just curious.  He's an intriguing and sympathetic character, a Brit writer with a lot of time on his hands who seems something of a throwback to an earlier age with his clanking manual typewriter and the photo of a pursed-lips Marilyn Monroe on the wall of his shabby apartment.Things began to go wrong for him, he further explains, when he broke some of his ""following rules"" and got too close to his prey.  What he doesn't know and what we don't know yet, is that his clumsy following technique has allowed him to unwittingly become the followed himself.Enter a juicy blonde (Lucy Russell) walking down some steps from her apartment.  (This scene is out of sequence as far as chronological time goes, but psychologically speaking, her appearance signals his entanglement).  Enter now a scheming, sophisticated psychopathic thrill-seeker named Cobb (Alex Haw) who entices Bill with his (apparent) practice of burglary just for the powerful feeling one gets from invading the sanctity of another's life.Although justification for the temporal inversions here is not as clearly established as in Memento, nonetheless the technique works well, and Nolan provides us with a clever ending that sneaks up on us and makes in a few seconds all that went before clear.  Or mostly clear.  You might want to rewind and view the first few minutes of the film, and then everything should be clarity.This low-budget, black and white, deliciously ironic little film (71 minutes) marked the auspicious debut of a film maker who has already made quite a name for himself, not only with the aforementioned Memento, but with Insomnia (2002).

Appropriate, effective use of hand-held cameras give the screen a disheveled, voyeuristic look and feel that had me averting my eyes out of guilt and embarrassment once or twice. A very small, casual cast seemed to know that's what Nolan was after, and played it up beautifully, with sudden piercing glares that often shot straight through the lens.

The film was a newly created 35mm print and in my opinion, this blu ray looks a bit better. The grainy look of the original film is there, but it has been cleaned up and sharpened quite a bit. This is probably the best this film is ever going to look and it was a revelation to see it. The restoration was supervised by Chris Nolan himself. Included are several bonus features such as a side by side view of the script and the film, an in depth 26 minute interview with Nolan done in 2010, the director's commentary on previous  releases, and a version of the film in chronological order, like on the Memento special edition DVD release.The Criterion Collection has done this film some serious justice and put out a beautiful looking and worthy title of their name.

The plot is pretty simple, but an interesting concept and the script is pretty intelligent. I like the interaction between the two main characters. It&#8217;s quirky. An artist with a weird need to follow people around bumps into a thief and they form an interesting bond that goes a little wrong. It&#8217;s got little twist, nothing jaw dropping, but I was surprised.

This movie proves that a cinematic story can be told without special effects, big-name stars, or a big budget.  What's important is the director's vision.  And what a vision director Nolan had.  Following is a modern film noir that honors the classic genre and elevates it; using his now-familiar non-chronological approach to telling the tale.The actual story isn't very complicated once you piece it together in the right sequence.  However, it's beautifully revealed in bits and pieces as you first see the end, then the beginning, then the middle, then back to the beginning, then the end.At only one hour and a few minutes, there's not a dull minute in the film.

497393,A3LP5RUMWG7GQ0,B00000F3CD,I. Westray,"[101, 103]","If you're looking at this DVD, odds are it's because you saw &quot;Memento&quot; and wondered about the director, Christopher Nolan. Let's cut to the chase: Yes, &quot;Following&quot; is similar to &quot;Memento&quot; -- its narrative jumps around in a similar way, to start with -- and yes, it's basically just as good a movie. If you're wanting to stumble across a great young film noir director, Christopher Nolan is your guy, and this movie is well worth a look. Make that two or three looks.I have to say, when I read the DVD case and saw that this plot wasn't told chronologically, the first word that came to mind was &quot;gimmick.&quot; For &quot;Memento&quot; it made sense to tell things backward, because of the whole memory-impairment center of the story, but here Nolan was doing it again in an earlier movie? I was set to see a sort of warmup run, especially because this one was made with almost no budget at all.Okay, so I was wrong. &quot;Following&quot; tells a few different lines of the story at once, but it doesn't tell them in reverse; here the idea is that the story's framework is a conversation between our main character and another man who's interviewing him in the opening moments. In the (dryly funny) director commentary, Nolan says he's trying to provide the viewer with details and themes in a &quot;conversational&quot; way. Maybe that's a conceit, but dang it, the mixed up storyline worked on this one too.Two other common points of the two movies: they're built on incredibly spare, lean writing, and they really, really reward watching at least twice.Following, if anything, is even more minimalistic than Memento; it's literally true that you come out of the movie not knowing any of the characters' real names. Given the premise -- that the main character develops an inappropriate, fascinated interest in the intimate lives of anonymous people he sees in a crowd -- the doubt you feel even about the characters' names makes perfect sense. A bunch of other little touches on that theme really hit home with me -- boxes full of memorabilia that are (or maybe aren't) giving our protagonist a look at people's internal lives, and so on. Gradually you realize the story's so sparely told because we're like the main character, trying to figure people out by looking at the pieces of their story from a distance in a crowd.And man, does Following reward a second watching. You'll get through it once and you'll kick it around for a while, work out the stuff you missed, tell your friends what you noticed... and then you all want to hit Play again. Every scene plays a little differently the second, or third, time through. That's exactly the sort of movie you want to collect, right?If you are a collector sort, you'll like the few extras this one provides. For a &quot;no budget&quot; indie film, it really &quot;gets&quot; the DVD thing. There's an alternate camera angle with the modified script, so you can play through and watch where Nolan and company made changes along the way. Some of the changes are pretty funny; the sound guy's name got substituted for one of the character names. Nolan's commentary soundtrack is really worth hearing, too, especially because he made this with no money at all. He talks about how he established continuity for the viewer with little visual cues, throws off very funny little asides about how he cut corners, and stuff like that. Finally, you also get a &quot;chronological&quot; option, so you can see everything in order. It's all set in a nicely elegant set of menus that match the sleak tone of the movie.So, yeah, it's worth it. Following is extremely memorable. It's not a perfect movie, or anything -- I'd still say either The Third Man or The Big Sleep is my favorite film noir -- but give it four stars and change, for doing so much on a shoestring.You gotta wonder what Christopher Nolan can do to back this up. He's going to have more money in hand, and the fractured story thing might not last another movie. Hearing the director commentary on this disc, I don't think he's going to necessarily be limited to the cynical point of view these two movies have seemed to push. The guy has a real eye for character, for the way people head in unlikely directions... This could be an amazing career we're seeing start up, or then again maybe these are just a little too cynical to start with.",4,Exceptional DVD,1010188800,"01 5, 2002",2002,4381,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'DVD', 'odds', 'are', 'saw', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'wondered', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Let', 'cut', 'chase', 'Yes', 'quot', 'Following', 'quot', 'similar', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'narrative', 'jumps', 'similar', 'way', 'start', 'yes', 'basically', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'movie', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'stumble', 'great', 'young', 'film', 'noir', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'guy', 'movie', 'well', 'look', 'Make', 'two', 'three', 'looks.I', 'have', 'say', 'when', 'read', 'DVD', 'case', 'saw', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'told', 'chronologically', 'first', 'word', 'came', 'mind', 'was', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'made', 'sense', 'tell', 'things', 'backward', 'whole', 'memory-impairment', 'center', 'story', 'here', 'Nolan', 'was', 'doing', 'again', 'earlier', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'see', 'sort', 'warmup', 'run', 'especially', 'one', 'was', 'made', 'almost', 'budget', 'all.Okay', 'was', 'wrong', 'quot', 'Following', 'quot', 'few', 'different', 'lines', 'story', 'once', ""n't"", 'tell', 'reverse', 'here', 'idea', 'story', 'framework', 'conversation', 'main', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'interviewing', 'opening', 'moments', 'dryly', 'funny', 'director', 'commentary', 'Nolan', 'trying', 'provide', 'viewer', 'details', 'themes', 'quot', 'conversational', 'quot', 'way', 'Maybe', 'conceit', 'mixed', 'up', 'storyline', 'worked', 'one', 'too.Two', 'other', 'common', 'points', 'two', 'movies', ""'re"", 'built', 'incredibly', 'spare', 'lean', 'writing', 'really', 'really', 'reward', 'watching', 'least', 'twice.Following', 'anything', 'even', 'more', 'minimalistic', 'Memento', 'literally', 'true', 'come', 'movie', 'not', 'knowing', 'characters', 'real', 'names', 'Given', 'premise', 'main', 'character', 'inappropriate', 'fascinated', 'interest', 'intimate', 'lives', 'anonymous', 'people', 'crowd', 'doubt', 'feel', 'even', 'characters', 'names', 'perfect', 'sense', 'bunch', 'other', 'little', 'touches', 'theme', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'boxes', 'full', 'memorabilia', 'are', 'maybe', 'are', ""n't"", 'giving', 'protagonist', 'look', 'people', 'internal', 'lives', 'so', 'Gradually', 'realize', 'story', 'so', 'sparely', 'told', ""'re"", 'main', 'character', 'trying', 'figure', 'people', 'out', 'looking', 'pieces', 'story', 'distance', 'crowd.And', 'man', 'Following', 'reward', 'second', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'get', 'once', ""'ll"", 'kick', 'around', 'while', 'work', 'out', 'stuff', 'missed', 'tell', 'friends', 'what', 'noticed', 'then', 'want', 'hit', 'Play', 'again', 'Every', 'scene', 'little', 'differently', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'exactly', 'sort', 'movie', 'want', 'collect', 'right', 'are', 'collector', 'sort', ""'ll"", 'like', 'few', 'extras', 'one', 'quot', 'budget', 'quot', 'indie', 'film', 'really', 'quot', 'quot', 'DVD', 'thing', 'alternate', 'camera', 'angle', 'modified', 'script', 'can', 'play', 'watch', 'where', 'Nolan', 'company', 'made', 'changes', 'way', 'changes', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'sound', 'guy', 'name', 'got', 'substituted', 'one', 'character', 'names', 'Nolan', 'commentary', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'worth', 'hearing', 'too', 'especially', 'made', 'money', 'how', 'established', 'continuity', 'viewer', 'little', 'visual', 'cues', 'off', 'very', 'funny', 'little', 'asides', 'how', 'cut', 'corners', 'stuff', 'Finally', 'also', 'get', 'quot', 'chronological', 'quot', 'option', 'can', 'see', 'everything', 'order', 'set', 'nicely', 'elegant', 'set', 'menus', 'match', 'sleak', 'tone', 'movie.So', 'yeah', 'Following', 'extremely', 'memorable', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'anything', ""'d"", 'still', 'say', 'Third', 'Man', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'favorite', 'film', 'noir', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'change', 'doing', 'so', 'much', 'shoestring.You', 'got', 'ta', 'wonder', 'what', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'can', 'do', 'back', 'up', 'going', 'have', 'more', 'money', 'hand', 'fractured', 'story', 'thing', 'might', 'not', 'last', 'movie', 'Hearing', 'director', 'commentary', 'disc', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'going', 'necessarily', 'be', 'limited', 'cynical', 'point', 'view', 'two', 'movies', 'have', 'seemed', 'push', 'guy', 'real', 'eye', 'character', 'way', 'people', 'head', 'unlikely', 'directions', 'could', 'be', 'amazing', 'career', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'start', 'up', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'are', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'cynical', 'start']",Following

497395,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B00000F3CD,Jason Bean,"[1, 1]","Chrisopher Nolan has been dazzling critics and movie-goers since his first big hit 'Memento'. Since then he's been filling his movies with neat ideas, great actors and special effects in films like 'Dark Knight' and 'Inception' but his stories are starting to lose their spark. While Nolan's definitely one of the more creative movie makers working today, when it comes to characters and story-telling I think he has yet to top his low-budget indie film 'Following' (at least as both writer/director).'Following' is about a young wannabe writer who likes to follow random people from a distance. He first starts doing this to get ideas for characters for stories he's writing but then becomes addicted and starts developing rules for who to follow and how. He does this until he follows man named Cobb (nice nod from Inception) who confronts him then draws him into his own voyeuristic world of breaking into stranger's houses and 'disrupting' their lives. The story is told in a non-linear style with flash-backs and flash-forwards though much less gimmicky than Memento and it really holds your attention. Christopher Nolan also managed to cram his screenplay with suspense and some suprising dark humor as it follows our main characters to their fates. The music, though sparse is very well implimented and gives the film real energy. Like Nolan's other films there are points in the story where it seems the filmmaker is just making things up as he goes, but 'Following's unique feel and atmosphere keeps the movie afloat.The performances and camera work really compliment 'Following'. Both Jeremy Theobald (as ""Bill"") and Alex Haw (as Cobb) bring real authenticity to their roles that grounds this film in it's world. The Black and White camera work also does a great job giving the movie a very isolated feel.As I said before I've sort of lost interest in Christopher Nolan's newer films because he keeps heaping them with more and more creative ideas and special effects but forgets about what can really draw people into a story and it's characters. 'Following' is still a shining example of what you can do even on a shoe-string budget and no reputation.",4,"A fascinating, unique film...",1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,2163,"['Chrisopher', 'Nolan', 'been', 'dazzling', 'critics', 'movie-goers', 'first', 'big', 'hit', 'then', 'been', 'filling', 'movies', 'neat', 'ideas', 'great', 'actors', 'special', 'effects', 'films', ""'Dark"", 'Knight', ""'Inception"", 'stories', 'are', 'starting', 'lose', 'spark', 'Nolan', 'definitely', 'one', 'more', 'creative', 'movie', 'makers', 'working', 'today', 'when', 'characters', 'story-telling', 'think', 'yet', 'top', 'low-budget', 'indie', 'film', ""'Following"", 'least', 'writer/director', ""'Following"", 'young', 'wannabe', 'writer', 'who', 'follow', 'random', 'people', 'distance', 'first', 'doing', 'get', 'ideas', 'characters', 'stories', 'writing', 'then', 'addicted', 'developing', 'rules', 'who', 'follow', 'how', 'man', 'named', 'Cobb', 'nice', 'nod', 'Inception', 'who', 'then', 'own', 'voyeuristic', 'world', 'breaking', 'stranger', 'houses', ""'disrupting"", 'lives', 'story', 'told', 'non-linear', 'style', 'flash-backs', 'flash-forwards', 'much', 'less', 'gimmicky', 'Memento', 'really', 'attention', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'also', 'managed', 'cram', 'screenplay', 'suspense', 'suprising', 'dark', 'humor', 'main', 'characters', 'fates', 'music', 'sparse', 'very', 'well', 'implimented', 'film', 'real', 'energy', 'Nolan', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'points', 'story', 'where', 'filmmaker', 'just', 'making', 'things', 'up', ""'Following"", 'unique', 'feel', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'afloat.The', 'performances', 'camera', 'work', 'really', 'compliment', ""'Following"", 'Jeremy', 'Theobald', 'Bill', 'Alex', 'Haw', 'Cobb', 'bring', 'real', 'authenticity', 'roles', 'film', 'world', 'Black', 'White', 'camera', 'work', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'giving', 'movie', 'very', 'isolated', 'feel.As', 'said', ""'ve"", 'sort', 'lost', 'interest', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'newer', 'films', 'heaping', 'more', 'more', 'creative', 'ideas', 'special', 'effects', 'forgets', 'what', 'can', 'really', 'draw', 'people', 'story', 'characters', ""'Following"", 'still', 'shining', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'even', 'shoe-string', 'budget', 'reputation']",Following
497396,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B00000F3CD,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[3, 3]","Christopher Nolan is now one of the biggest filmmakers on the planet, but his first studio feature was a modest remake of the Norwegian film Insomnia. In any other filmmaker's hands this project could have easily turned into a cliched cop drama, but Nolan made it into an intense character study that landed him the job of rebooting Batman. Out of seven feature films in his career, Nolan has five that appear in IMDb's Top 250 as voted on by average viewers who visit the site. Of his seven feature-length films, Nolan's auspicious debut, Following, is his most overlooked.Filmed over the course of a year due to cast and crew working other full-time jobs and funded on Nolan's own dime for a mere $6,000, Following is about a writer (a young man who remains nameless) that follows strangers around to conduct research for his writing but also to cure his feelings of loneliness. Although the writer has established strict rules for following people, he finds himself thrust into a world of crime when he breaks those rules by following a man named Cobb (a name that will appear in a future Nolan movie).Throughout Following you'll find motifs that appear throughout Nolan's future films. One of the first things you'll notice is the non-linear plot line that pops up again in movies like Batman Begins, The Prestige, and Inception. Here the pieces might not seem to fit together as well as they do in Nolan's future films, but they add to the mystery of figuring out exactly what's going on throughout the movie. As you watch this film you're able to piece things together, but at first the effect of this technique can seem a little more jarring than in the films made after Nolan perfected his craft.The central themes apparent throughout Nolan's work, along with his unique brand of story telling, are also present in Following. The story of a man following strangers works brilliantly as a means of exploring the kind of moral ambiguity that leads down dark paths and eventually spirals out of control; the kind of ambiguity that Nolan would go on to explore in films like The Dark Knight and The Prestige. Nolan stages Following as a neo-noir film, noir being a difficult style of filmmaking that he appears to be more than adept at handling.If you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's brand of filmmaking I suggest you give this a try. Unfortunately when I say that it's overlooked I mean that the DVD is currently out of print, although you can still buy used copies on Amazon. However, if you have Netflix feel free to add it to your queue or check it out on Instant. Much like Kevin Smith's Clerks or Darren Aronofsky's Pi this film is very gritty, but the style is still Nolan's own. Of course, if you're like me you're more about substance than style.

FOLLOWING has somewhat of that same flavor, though not so engagingly or cleverly done.In this film, Jeremy Theobald plays Bill, a young Londoner addicted to following people - not with any malicious intent, but just out of curiosity.  After a period of initial confusion for which the viewer might be excused, it becomes apparent that scenes from three timelines are being depicted. There's the present, in which Bill is telling an interviewer (lawyer, psychologist, police official ?) the genesis of his current situation, beginning with his practice of following strangers. There's the relatively distant past, in which Bill is confronted by one of his quarry, Cobb (Alex Haw), a sartorially elegant house burglar, who befriends Bill and includes him on his capers. Finally, the relatively recent past, in which Bill is dating The Blond (Lucy Russell), one of the pair's victims that isn't what she appears to be. The first clue I had that three timelines were running intermixed was Bill's facial appearance: scruffily bearded and unkemptly dressed, well dressed and clean shaven, and the latter plus a bruised face.The plot twist, when it finally comes, is sufficiently unexpected to raise an eyebrow. However, unlike Pearce's Leonard in MEMENTO, the characters are all so universally unattractive that it was hard to care when the patsy among them took the fall. Also, the director's decision to photograph in black and white added nothing as far as I was concerned; color would have sufficed. Blessedly, the run time is only 70 minutes.

During that time he has become very bored and needs to find ways to kill time.  He starts to follow people... anybody who seemed interesting to him.  At first it was supposed to be a way for him to gather material for characters in his stories, but soon he becomes obsessed and cannot stop following people.  Once a thief, Cobb, catches Bill in the act, he decides to allow him to enter his world of robbing houses, showing Bill how to really violate the lives of strangers.  Soon everything starts to spin out of control and things for Bill will never be the same as he starts to learn that somebody just might be trying to use him as a decoy.... but a decoy for what?  This dark film noir will keep you watching and thinking, even when it's all said and done.  Then, you're going to want to watch it again.Very much like &quot;Memento,&quot; Nolan screws around with time, forcing us to remember exactly what has happened and the order they occurred in.  However, the movie is not backwards, it is very much out of order in parts, so pay attention to every little detail that you come across.  Is this film confusing?  Yes, it is, or at least the first time you see it.  This is a movie that will require you to watch it at least two times.  Although I thought this was a good movie, I was a little disappointed with the length of the movie.  It is only 70 minutes long, which isn't very long at all.  It's also not widescreen, but I'm sure that' s because it wasn't filmed that way.  It is black and white, very much like &quot;Clerks,&quot; but it actually makes the film seem more darker and eerier.  The movie does have great acting, from people you've never even heard of most likely, and it does have a great story line.  It tends to be confusing at times, even frustrating.  So see it with an open mind.  I loved the music in it and you will be glad to know that it is the same person Nolan used for &quot;Memento.&quot;  There are a few extras on the DVD; one of the best features is the ability for you to see the movie in chronological order.

497410,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00000F3CD,Mike Stone,"[6, 6]","Wes Anderson made ""Bottle Rocket"" for no money, and then followed it up with the critically lauded ""Rushmore"".  Darren Aronofsky made ""Pi"" for no money, and then followed it up with the critically lauded ""Requiem for a Dream"".  Richard Linklater, Guy Ritchie, and Tom Tykwer, some of my favourite filmmakers working today, have all followed this formula for success.Add Christopher Nolan's name to this list.  Before making the critically lauded smash ""Memento"", he hunkered down and wrote an engrossing script, raised a minimal amount of capital, cast some amateur/non-actors, found some cheap black and white film, and took to the streets guerrilla-style to complete his first film.  What we get is the engrossing neo-noir of ""Following"".And we also get a kind of proto-""Memento"".  Nolan, in what some may call a gimmick, again utilizes an irregular story structure to tell the tale of a lonely man caught up in extraordinary circumstances.  The story, complicated enough if it were told straight (more on that later) is divided into three acts.  The trick is that all three acts are told simultaneously; a scene from one follows a scene from another, which follows a scene from the third.  The effect is somewhat jarring: protagonist Bill (or is it Danny?  Or, as the credits denote him, The Young Man) sometimes has long hair and a goatee, sometimes sports a short haircut and a clean suit, and sometimes shows the cuts and bruises from a brutal beating.  All within consecutive scenes.  Fear not, for there is a method to Nolan's madness.  He does his best to play fair with the audience, to provide them with visual clues so they can tell where they are in the story.  Nolan, as he later would show with ""Memento"", is a masterful puppeteer, controlling all the limbs of his story with skill and precision.Populating the disordered order of ""Following"" is a small cast of unknown actors, many making their first and only screen appearances.  Jeremy Theobald plays The Young Man (he also co-produces; the director's commentary track notes that 'Jerry' was responsible for location scouting, on top of playing the lead).  He's got low-key appeal, essential for essaying a loner looking for any human contact he can muster.  Bill has taken to picking out a random person in a crowd, and following them around, ostensibly to gather character information for his writing, but more likely in the hopes of creating an imaginary friend.  When one such 'friend' catches him in the act, Theobald does a fantastic job of showing Bill's discomfort, and then his gradual easing into the situation.  Cobb, the friend in question, is a hyper-confidant thief, played with slimy charm by Alex Haw.  Haw is great at showing Cobb's malice, his untrustworthiness, as well as the plethora of reasons that draw Bill to him.  He's got a toned-down Richard E. Grant quality about him, although less kinetic and manic.  Lucy Russell, as The Blonde, is really nothing more than that.  Russell does fine showing her femme fatale-ness, but really brings little else to the role, including the desirability that all the characters keep insisting she has.""Following"" is a quick (67 minutes) slice of urban isolation.  You feel for Bill as he spirals down deeper and deeper into a web of intrigue.  And the discerning audience member will appreciate having to pay attention to a plot that gives you all the clues you'll need, but never holds your hand.  If you've done your homework, and been alert the whole time, the ending will leave you mouth agape.NOTES ON THE DVDThe DVD is jam-packed with goodies, mounds more than a movie of this magnitude would normally deserve.  I guess Nolan took every post-""Memento"" opportunity to shed light on his little-seen first feature.  I think it deserves all it gets.Nolan's commentary track focuses on his knowledge that he'd never have any money to make this film, and how that knowledge affected everything from the script he wrote, to the way he lit the film, to the choice of using black and white, to the actors he used and they way they rehearsed, to the locations.  It's a very thoughtful commentary, full of useful tidbits for other first time filmmakers.  Nolan's monotone delivery can be somnolent at times, but he's so smart and precise about what he's saying you can easily overlook that and become engrossed in the content.Using the alternate angle button on your DVD player allows the viewer to see the current page of Nolan's shooting script while the movie is running.  It is interesting to see where changes were made, and to figure out why.  Often budgetary restraints were the deciding factor, but some changes were made to tighten up and improve the storytelling.And as a neat little toy for those with an insatiable curiosity, the DVD comes with a feature allowing you to restructure ""Following"" chronologically.  Its main benefit is that it proves that the film's modular structure is not merely a gimmick, but amplifies the intensity and dynamic tension of the story.""Following"" can be a tough sell for some; its grainy (but gloriously shadow-intensive) cinematography and bare bones approach to acting and scenery are a far cry from big-budget Hollywood.  But it is still an engrossing work, one that, like its younger sibling, rewards repeat viewings.  I've seen it three times now, and am still amazed at the bang for his buck that Nolan achieved.",4,Add me to Chris Nolan's growing 'Following',1023667200,"06 10, 2002",2002,5387,"['Wes', 'Anderson',

When he's caught by one of the followees (Alex Haw) he's lured into a game of burglary.  A game because, making money isn't the motive.

I decided to watch this because it's by the same director and I was wondering what else he could come up with. And I wasn't dissapointed. The movie is in black and white and jumps around the timeline in an interesting way, which keeps you focused and trying to figure out what's going on. I thought the general idea of the movie, about a guy who follows and watches random people, trying to figure out who they are and what they do, is quite original but at the same time common to everybody -- who hasn't wondered about the random person on the street (I sure have).The way the movie is presented is involving and at times humorous. The way the camera is positioned you really get a feel for being right there, next to the characters and involved in the storyline.The movie is just as good on the second or third viewing (like Memento), and that's definitely evidence to the fact it's good.I would definitely recommend this movie to people who liked Memento; you won't be dissapointed with it.",5,"If you liked memento, you'll like this one",1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,1055,"['have', 'say', 'Memento', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'decided', 'watch', 'same', 'director', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'dissapointed', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'jumps', 'timeline', 'interesting', 'way', 'focused', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'thought', 'general', 'idea', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'watches', 'random', 'people', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'do', 'quite', 'original', 'same', 'time', 'common', 'everybody', 'who', ""n't"", 'wondered', 'random', 'person', 'street', 'sure', 'have', '.The', 'way', 'movie', 'presented', 'involving', 'times', 'humorous', 'way', 'camera', 'positioned', 'really', 'get', 'feel', 'being', 'right', 'there', 'next', 'characters', 'involved', 'storyline.The', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'second', 'third', 'viewing', 'Memento', 'definitely', 'evidence', 'fact', 'good.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'Memento', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed']",Following

While not perfect, its manipulation of time and use of the film noir genre is admirable and proved to be the precursor to his first widely released and superior Memento.Following is about a man with the habit of following strangers, and what happens when one of them turns out to be a follower himself. The film cleverly mixes up time, showing scenes out of order to raise questions to what later happens to the follower. At the beginning, he's long haired and unshaven, but in other scenes he's cleaned up and others he's bruised and beaten up. It's a wonderful technique to keep the audience involved in the film. We know he must get into some serious trouble, but we don't know what or why. The film's black and white photography, while likely chosen more for its inexpensive trait, complements the film noir aspects of the storyline.However, mostly due to the small budget, the acting isn't too great. Only the thief character named Cobb whom the follower gets involved with is convincing in his role. Everyone else feels like a B-movie actor, and not very good ones at that. But another downfall of this film isn't much a fault of its own. Nolan's later film Memento tells another noir story in a very similar style, but with amazing fashion (telling the story completely backwards) and a story arc (A man with a memory disorder after his wife was murdered) that far outshines Following's smaller ideas. Here it seems he was just beginning to toy with time and scene order in film, so he'd really get it right in Memento.Overall, Following is a decent little flick that is better rented before being purchased. Fans of Memento may find it especially interesting to see how the director began shifting time and scenes around in preparation for his later mind bender, but the average film viewer might want to skip it and check out the superior Memento instead.",3,The decent precursor to Nolan's outstanding Memento,1043625600,"01 27, 2003",2003,1938,"['film', 'debut', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Following', 'showed', 'serious', 'promise', 'not', 'perfect', 'manipulation', 'time', 'use', 'film', 'noir', 'genre', 'admirable', 'proved', 'be', 'precursor', 'first', 'widely', 'released', 'superior', 'Memento.Following', 'man', 'habit', 'following', 'strangers', 'what', 'when', 'one', 'out', 'be', 'follower', 'film', 'cleverly', 'mixes', 'up', 'time', 'showing', 'scenes', 'order', 'raise', 'questions', 'what', 'later', 'follower', 'beginning', 'long', 'haired', 'unshaven', 'other', 'scenes', 'cleaned', 'up', 'others', 'bruised', 'beaten', 'up', 'wonderful', 'technique', 'keep', 'audience', 'involved', 'film', 'know', 'must', 'get', 'serious', 'trouble', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'why', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'likely', 'chosen', 'more', 'inexpensive', 'trait', 'film', 'noir', 'aspects', 'storyline.However', 'mostly', 'due', 'small', 'budget', 'acting', ""n't"", 'too', 'great', 'Only', 'thief', 'character', 'named', 'Cobb', 'whom', 'follower', 'involved', 'convincing', 'role', 'Everyone', 'else', 'B-movie', 'actor', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'ones', 'downfall', 'film', ""n't"", 'much', 'fault', 'own', 'Nolan', 'later', 'film', 'Memento', 'noir', 'story', 'very', 'similar', 'style', 'amazing', 'fashion', 'telling', 'story', 'completely', 'backwards', 'story', 'arc', 'man', 'memory', 'disorder', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'far', 'Following', 'smaller', 'ideas', 'Here', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'toy', 'time', 'scene', 'order', 'film', ""'d"", 'really', 'get', 'right', 'Memento.Overall', 'Following', 'decent', 'little', 'flick', 'better', 'rented', 'being', 'purchased', 'Fans', 'Memento', 'may', 'find', 'especially', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'director', 'began', 'shifting', 'time', 'scenes', 'preparation', 'later', 'mind', 'bender', 'average', 'film', 'viewer', 'might', 'want', 'skip', 'check', 'out', 'superior', 'Memento', 'instead']",Following

If you can imagine that feeling of anxiety, then you'll understand how exhilarated I am to tell you that Christopher Nolan (in my opinion) has a perfect track record of excellence in his decade-long library.FOLLOWING shares many similarities to MEMENTO.  Nolan penned both screenplays, produced both pictures, used David Julyan to compose a minimal score for each movie, and presents the plot out of chronological order.  But to list the shared qualities between the two films is just as if you tired to compare Nolan's INSOMNIA to the 1998 original - you're missing out on the unique complexities.As FOLLOWING begins, we see brief random images that clue us into the literal and metaphorical shape of the story.  Then, a young man is telling his story to an older authority figure in flashback.  Jeremy Theobald, an actor I regretfully haven't seen in anything else, plays this unnamed character.  His voice-over narration reveals that in order to inspire his writing, he innocently (?) shadowed London strangers.  But soon, he is caught by one of his random selections in a diner.  The stranger swiftly and seductively turns the tables on the follower, and convinces him to tag along for a burglary.What's interesting about this thief is that he shares some remarkable similarities to The Joker in THE DARK KNIGHT: sinister yet irresistible, criminal yet logical, dangerous yet comforting.  Like the Young Man, our assumptions about this thief's greed are quickly overturned by his philosophical justifications.  What's more disturbing, is we're tempted to discover the secrets of others we don't know.  The thief, calling himself ""Cobb"", soon reveals that he doesn't loot for money.  He steals personal items instead, claiming that this invasion of privacy will impact his victims in a profound way.The plot isn't told in chronological order, but unlike MEMENTO, there is no particular pattern to the puzzle.  The timeline is more like Alejandro Gonzalez Inarrittu's movies (21 GRAMS or BABEL, for example): told in random pieces, so that we're unsure if we're one step ahead of the characters, or vice versa.  The main story arc focuses on the Young Man's involvement with a femme fatale, whose troubles with a powerful ex-boyfriend allow this Young Man (and us) to penetrate her innermost secrets.  Like the greatest film noirs, FOLLOWING is so much more than a visually stunning piece of bizarre entertainment.  The story is primarily (I think) an exploration of how our privacy can be violated in the most unusual ways; its unusual focus forces us to join the thieves for the ride.  When Cobb and The Young Man enter these strangers' homes, I felt a guilty rush like when Michael Corleone almost couldn't find the gun in the bathroom stall.  After all, did I really want to see either of these criminals get caught in the act?But this guilt is where Nolan is crucial to the piece.  He never once approves of this behavior.  He doesn't even sympathize with the Young Man's new ladyfriend, in spite of her exposure to brutish violence.  But the secret to Nolan's success in FOLLOWING (and perhaps MEMENTO) is that his artistry paints the portrait, but makes it our responsibility to describe it.  I think Nolan is very in tune with his audiences.  He carefully constructs the story, but leaves us with plenty of subtleties to discover over time.I won't give away where the story goes next, because FOLLOWING depends on a first-time viewing more than any of Nolan's other films.  There are some twists in the plot that are effective the first time around, but aren't as surprising after repeat viewings.  That's not to say FOLLOWING isn't an excellent picture, because its psychological depth is a genuine delight.  But like Nolan's THE PRESTIGE, there may be one too many twists.  The developments work and make sense, but don't hit the gut as much as other surprises in Nolan's other pictures.  Think of a clock whose hands make a slightly noisier sound than you might prefer.While this is my personal least favorite of Christopher Nolan's film catalog, FOLLOWING is an exemplary movie well worth your time.  It's black-and-white photography and limited budgetshouldn't discourage you from one of the 90s' most intelligent psychological thrillers.  Nolan had the confidence in his story - or at least good budget management - to keep the time length to a tight 71 minutes, and it's not a moment too short or too long.  FOLLOWING is a tale so absorbing, it's a shame we didn't hear of this Nolan guy right away.  Good thing MEMENTO was his next picture, right?***DVD Notes***This Columbia DVD release includes:1) A trailer2) An alternate angle to read the screenplay while the movie plays3) The option to play the movie in chronological order4) An audio commentary track by Christopher NolanNolan's humility and intelligence make any interview or commentary track a pleasure to listen to, and the alternate options to watch FOLLOWING are a nice touch.

Bill is an unemployed, aspiring writer who substitutes the dullness in his own life by following strangers walking down the street. His plans, however, take an unexpected turn when he follows a man who confronts him for shadowing him. Soon Bill realizes that this reluctant 'subject', Cobb, also participates in voyeuristic activities of breaking into apartments and rummaging through their belongings. Cobb leads Bill down a path that will forever change him, and one that he cannot return from. In a similar fashion as Momento, FOLLOWING is filmed in non-chronological order and includes many plots twists and turns along the way. Once the audience believes they know what is going on, the tables are turned on them once again. This film has a similar feel as Momento and even contains a comparable narrator. Also included on this DVD are several special features that further enhance the viewing experience, such as an alternate version of the film shown in chronological order and a version shot from a different camera angle.

497427,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00000F3CD,Steven Aldersley,"[5, 5]","Are you a fan of Christopher Nolan? His impressive filmography includes Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception, and The Dark Knight Rises. But his first feature was Following, and I imagine that there are plenty of Nolan fans who haven't got around to seeing it. My first viewing was just a few months ago, shortly after the Criterion Blu-ray release.Why do I want to review it?Well, one reason is that I wanted to talk about the first first film made by one of the best directors working today. Another incentive was the presence of actual ideas. Following is unpredictable, and does not use proven formulas. It works because it is genuinely interesting and compelling.You have probably never heard of the actors involved. The two principals haven't had much of a career since, but I enjoyed their performances. The film is full of mysteries and revelations, so I am not going to talk about everything that happens. Instead, I'll limit most of my comments to things we learn in the opening 10 minutes.The film grabbed my attention after two minutes during the opening narration by Bill (Jeremy Theobald), who is the main character. He tells us that he's unemployed, and frequently bored and lonely. In order to combat his boredom, he decides to start following people at random. In his own mind, he's an aspiring writer, although he probably views himself that way to justify his miserable existence. He's interested in people and what motivates them. When he's following someone, he has a certain set of rules, such as not pursuing women along dark alleys at night. He's a keen observer, but not a predator of any kind. He follows people of any gender, watches what they do, and then leaves.Bill's problems begin when he breaks one of his biggest rules, and decides to follow the same person more than once. The man calls himself Cobb (Alex Haw), and after noticing that he's being followed, he confronts Bill and questions him. Cobb dresses, acts, and sounds like a successful man, which is in total contrast to Bill's scruffy appearance and less formal way of speaking.Minor spoiler coming:Cobb allows Bill to look inside the bag he's carrying, and Bill realizes that it's full of goods that are presumably stolen. The two form a kind of partnership, and start to do burglaries together.I'm not going to reveal any more specific information, but I want to talk generally about the plot structure, and the overall feel of the film. The plot is fragmented, jumping around in time. If you have seen Memento, you'll recognize the style immediately. Bill's appearance changes, and is always a clue as to the timeline. As he's a writer, there's also a strong possibility that some of the events are things that he is imagining for a future story.Another key element is the music. It reminds me a little of Angelo Badalementi's work, and it wouldn't be too out of place in a David Lynch film. The film was shot in black and white with an aspect ratio of 1.37:1, so be prepared for that. Following was originally shot using 16 mm film, giving the piece a raw feel which suits the story, but the Criterion presentation is superb. The Blu-ray also includes the option to use an updated 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix, as well as the original mono. Like the Memento DVD, the special features offer the chance to see events in chronological order.After viewing the film a second time, I noticed that events had a different meaning because I was in full possession of the facts. Seemingly random encounters have more meaning because some of the people are recognizable. You'll probably ask yourself a lot of questions the first time you watch the events unfold. How does the character know that? Why is he doing that? Why is she acting that way? All of those questions will be answered by the end of the film, so trust that Nolan knows what he is doing and enjoy the ride. The revelations in the final 20 minutes will make you question everything you've seen up to that point, and then smile as you understand the logic.Following cost around $6,000 to make, and grossed just $43,000, but Nolan hasn't made a weak film yet and this deserves to be seen.

497428,A3HK5EM5F8MT8H,B00000F3CD,"T. Crockett ""Homebrewer""","[2, 2]","This movie is written from the same director that gave all of us the unbelievable movie ""Memento"", a cult legend in itself.  If you enjoyed Memento, stop reading this review and go buy yourself a copy of this movie 'ASAP'.  Now that is said, here's the review.  This movie is so smart and sophisticated!  It's a shifty, paranoid, devilishly clever, sleek, taut, exquisite, startling, with an eerie intensity, that will leave you wanting more.  These are what movies are supposed to be like.  director Christopher Nolan shows the world how movies are supposed to be directed.  You will have to put your thinking hats on for this one though, it's not for your mainstream movie watchers.  This one will need to be watched several times to put the whole story together (Like Memento, the more you watch this, the more you will see the whole picture).  Just remember after watching this movie ""Your Never Alone"".  Following is a wickedly clever story of how a young man's obsession with following people leads him into a dark underworld.  Bill, the unlikely hero, is a marginalized but intriguing everyday man who follows strangers at random on the street.  When Cobb, a man Bill has been following, catches him in the act, Bill is drawn into Cobb's world of breaking into flats and prying into the personal lives of their victims.  In Cobb, Bill finds a strange companion (Part mentor, part confessor and part evil twin).  With an ingenious structure that involves flash forwards and doubling back, the film tests our knowledge and understanding just as the protagionist is being duped into an elaborate triple-cross (And what a monster triple-cross it is, it will leave your jaw hitting the ground with shock).  This movie is intriguing....  It sucks you into its conceit with an ease, you won't be able to leave your T.V. until the very end, and then you will already want to watch it again.  I only wish I could give this movie more stars than 5.  Honestly, I think this is every bit as good as Memento, if not better.This movie won :* Winner Tiger Award @ The International Film Festival of Rotterdam* Official Selection @ Toronto International Film Festival* Official Selection @ San Francisco International Film FestivalIt's special features include :* Commentary by Director Christopher Nolan* Second angle showing Director's shooting script* Ability to restructure The Story Chronologically (This is way cool!  How many movies do you know of that you can piece back together to see it in the chronologically order, instead of the flash forwards and doubling back effect).

497429,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00000F3CD,trebe,"[2, 2]","Written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins,The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight Rises), Following (1998) is a film that sucks the viewer into a shadowy world of petty crime, romance, and intrigue, and then keeps you confused and off balance, with nonlinear storytelling that concludes unexpectedly.  The black and white presentation and low key approach, gives the movie a retro vibe, and neo-noir feel, as the film's stylish elements, contribute to a pretty interesting watch.Bill (Jeremy Theobald) is a struggling writer, who has developed the unusual habit of following people that he finds interesting, through the streets of London.  Bill's life changes, when one of his subjects, a thief named Cobb (Alex Haw), takes him on a job robbing a flat.For Cobb, who steals women's underwear, the thrill of violating the personal space of others, seems to be more important than making a big score.  Already involved in some questionable activities, Bill seems easily drawn into Cobb's criminal world.  Bill also begins a relationship with a woman (Lucy Russell) who has some connection with Cobb.  The web of deception grows more complex, and the intrigue builds, as some are manipulated for a fall.Told out of order, and featuring numerous jump cuts and flashbacks, the story doesn't flow very smoothly, and doesn't play fair with the audience, who must ""follow"" along, trying to sort out what is happening.  For many, a second viewing may be helpful in piecing the story together, and under detailed examination, the flaws become more pronounced.  On a first view, with confusion and uncertainty present, the film makes a compelling, although disjointed watch.The shifting time frame, makes it difficult for the story to build much momentum, but solid acting by Theobald, Russell, and Haws, holds your interest, with the character Cobb, bringing a theatrical flair to most things he does.  Christopher Nolan displays the ability to artfully tell a story in his feature film debut, earning a rating of 3.5 stars.",4,a quirky tale of misdirection...,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,2021,"['Written', 'directed', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'Following', '1998', 'film', 'viewer', 'shadowy', 'world', 'petty', 'crime', 'romance', 'intrigue', 'then', 'keeps', 'confused', 'balance', 'nonlinear', 'storytelling', 'unexpectedly', 'black', 'white', 'presentation', 'low', 'key', 'approach', 'movie', 'retro', 'vibe', 'neo-noir', 'feel', 'film', 'stylish', 'elements', 'contribute', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'watch.Bill', 'Jeremy', 'Theobald', 'struggling', 'writer', 'who', 'developed', 'unusual', 'habit', 'following', 'people', 'interesting', 'streets', 'London', 'Bill', 'life', 'changes', 'when', 'one', 'subjects', 'thief', 'named', 'Cobb', 'Alex', 'Haw', 'job', 'robbing', 'flat.For', 'Cobb', 'who', 'women', 'underwear', 'thrill', 'violating', 'personal', 'space', 'others', 'be', 'more', 'important', 'making', 'big', 'score', 'Already', 'involved', 'questionable', 'activities', 'Bill', 'easily', 'drawn', 'Cobb', 'criminal', 'world', 'Bill', 'also', 'relationship', 'woman', 'Lucy', 'Russell', 'who', 'connection', 'Cobb', 'web', 'deception', 'grows', 'more', 'complex', 'intrigue', 'builds', 'are', 'manipulated', 'fall.Told', 'out', 'order', 'featuring', 'numerous', 'jump', 'cuts', 'flashbacks', 'story', ""n't"", 'flow', 'very', 'smoothly', ""n't"", 'play', 'fair', 'audience', 'who', 'must', 'follow', 'trying', 'sort', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'many', 'second', 'viewing', 'may', 'be', 'helpful', 'piecing', 'story', 'together', 'detailed', 'examination', 'flaws', 'become', 'more', 'pronounced', 'first', 'view', 'confusion', 'uncertainty', 'present', 'film', 'compelling', 'disjointed', 'shifting', 'time', 'frame', 'difficult', 'story', 'build', 'much', 'momentum', 'solid', 'acting', 'Theobald', 'Russell', 'Haws', 'interest', 'character', 'Cobb', 'bringing', 'theatrical', 'flair', 'most', 'things', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'ability', 'artfully', 'tell', 'story', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'earning', 'rating', '3.5', 'stars']",Following
497430,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00000F3CD,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 7]","Christopher Nolan surprised movie fans with critically acclaimed &quot;Memento&quot; with its stylish, original storytelling, and if you're interested how he started his career, &quot;Following&quot; is a must for you to see.  The classic ingredints of the Holloywood's old film noir -- a deadly attractive but morally dubious character from the underworld, an unemployed self-claimed writer, and a blonde woman -- are suavely treated with skillful editing and moody 16 mm. black-and-white photography of London, and though the story itself is often too incredible (as many of the past noir masterpieces are), you find yourself drawn into the world Nolan created with this low-budget movie, just like the hapless hero of the film.Bill, a writer without writing anything, finds a new hobby.  That is following people he picks up on the street at random.  Without any particular reason Bill keeps on shadowing until he encounters Cobb, who notices his following, and boldly faces him to invite Bill to HIS own world of joy -- sneaking into someone's room.  This is the beginning of his little adventure, in which Bill meets another mysterious figure, a beautiful blonde girl, whose motive is unclear to him and also to us....As in &quot;Memento,&quot; a comparatively thin plot is enlarged with Nolan's unique storytelling techniques that break the rule of chronological order, making use of flash-back and flash-forward.  You have to always concentrate your mind on what's going on on the screen, to truly appreciate the impact of the unexpected windup of Bill's new hobby, which turns, as you know, a big nightmare.  Though I find the middle part of the film a little bit dull, and the story itself is too unbeliebavle, the film's integrity is a considerable one, making &quot;Following&quot; a rare treat for the fans of this film noir genre.My material about the film I got at theater says that as the filmmakers did another job on weekdays to earn money, they could spend only Saturdays to film the scenes, so the actors had to keep their haircut always the same for more than 20 weeks, so as to preserve  continuity!",4,Very Impressive Feature Debut from the Director of &quot;Memento&quot;,1019779200,"04 26, 2002",2002,2120,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'surprised', 'movie', 'fans', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'stylish', 'original', 'storytelling', ""'re"", 'interested', 'how', 'started', 'career', 'quot', 'Following', 'quot', 'must', 'see', 'classic', 'ingredints', 'Holloywood', 'old', 'film', 'noir', 'deadly', 'attractive', 'morally', 'dubious', 'character', 'underworld', 'unemployed', 'self-claimed', 'writer', 'blonde', 'woman', 'are', 'suavely', 'treated', 'skillful', 'editing', 'moody', '16', 'mm', 'black-and-white', 'photography', 'London', 'story', 'often', 'too', 'incredible', 'many', 'past', 'noir', 'masterpieces', 'are', 'find', 'drawn', 'world', 'Nolan', 'created', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'just', 'hapless', 'hero', 'film.Bill', 'writer', 'writing', 'anything', 'new', 'hobby', 'following', 'people', 'up', 'street', 'random', 'particular', 'reason', 'Bill', 'shadowing', 'Cobb', 'who', 'following', 'boldly', 'invite', 'Bill', 'HIS', 'own', 'world', 'joy', 'sneaking', 'someone', 'room', 'beginning', 'little', 'adventure', 'Bill', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'girl', 'motive', 'unclear', 'also', '.As', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'comparatively', 'thin', 'plot', 'enlarged', 'Nolan', 'unique', 'storytelling', 'techniques', 'break', 'rule', 'chronological', 'order', 'making', 'use', 'flash-back', 'flash-forward', 'have', 'always', 'concentrate', 'mind', 'what', 'going', 'screen', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'impact', 'unexpected', 'windup', 'Bill', 'new', 'hobby', 'know', 'big', 'nightmare', 'find', 'middle', 'part', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'dull', 'story', 'too', 'unbeliebavle', 'film', 'integrity', 'considerable', 'one', 'making', 'quot', 'Following', 'quot', 'rare', 'treat', 'fans', 'film', 'noir', 'genre.My', 'material', 'film', 'got', 'theater', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'job', 'weekdays', 'earn', 'money', 'could', 'spend', 'only', 'Saturdays', 'film', 'scenes', 'actors', 'had', 'keep', 'haircut', 'always', 'same', 'more', '20', 'weeks', 'so', 'preserve', 'continuity']",Following

That is, at first you see scenes from separate times and nothing makes sense, but in the end it all comes together in a way you'd never expect.I personally thought this movie was done better than Memento. For one, in the end there were absolutely NO loose threads. Every single detail made sense and fit into the story. In this way it was much less confusing than Memento was (I couldn't place a couple details when I watched that movie). The plot itself was like a mystery, a very interesting mystery which made me pay full attention the entire time.  It began to fit together quickly enough to keep me interested, but slowly enough to keep revealing more and more, steadily up until the end. The final ending was VERY clever, and quite unpredictable.The only real issue I can think of is that this movie is entirely in black and white, as if it were filmed by hand with an old-fashioned camera.  At first this detracts from the story.  But once the viewer is accustomed to it, it ends up adding to the surreal and mysterious atmosphere.  I really don't think the movie would have had as strong an effect if it had been in colour.In any case, it is hard to describe how perfect this movie was, how well the plot fit together, that amazing feeling I got while watching it as everything began to fit into place...

I liked his first one too, although probably the comparison with his follow up Hollywood production makes 'Following' even more interesting. It is low budget independent movie in noir style that is shot in black and white. The style of the movie reminds me old french crime movies although it adds the twists so familiar to us from 'Memento': the order of the movie doesn't follow the real order so you see different pieces in different times trying to recreate what really happened. The plot itself, although unpredictable (the ending is totally surprising) not really convincing and logical. But it's ok since, in my opinion, the main quality of this movie is its style.

Nolan likes to play with time in his films--the sequence of events and our perception of how they unfold.Shot for less than $5000 in black and white, ""Following"" focuses on a writer named Bill (co-producer Jeremey Theobald) who ""shadows"" people to experience a little bit of their lives. He meets a burglar named Cobb (Alex Haw) who robs to ""show people what they had"" and appreciate it. Bill aids Cobb in his burglaries and finds himself going down an unexpected rabbit hole from which he can't escape.What's surprising is how well made the film is given the budget and limitations that Nolan and his co-producers faced.The blu-ray transfer looks exceptionally good but keep in mind that ""Following"" was shot on 16mm B&W; film. That isn't to suggest that the film doesn't benefit from it (it does). Would the blu-ray look signficantly better than the DVD? I haven't compared them but the differences, I would imagine, would be marginal for most film fans. Nevertheless, Criterion has done a nice job of restoring the film under Nolan's supervision. We also get a nice 5.1 mix that is discreet.The big attraction here is Chris Nolan's commentary track which provides lots of interesting insights. We also get Nolan's short film ""Doodlebug"" as well as the film chronologically edited as well as a side-by-side comparison between three scenes from the film and the script. The big thing here is a new interview with Nolan done for the Criterion edition.
