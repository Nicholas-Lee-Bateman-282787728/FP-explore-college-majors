Should you tell your mate about your past? Should you forgive someone if they don't tell you everything about their past relationships? I enjoyed this film and especially enjoyed the performances of the lovely women in cast. Jazsmin Lewis is always a treat.

I saw this film on TV and enjoyed the story and actors so much I had to get this for my collection. I have  18 and 11 year old daughters and this was an excellent story of marriage but also about honoring Gods design of marriage (abstinence). It shows that God still loves all despite our choices and that others can change after making poor choices in life.
