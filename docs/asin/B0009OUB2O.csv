909775,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B0009OUB2O,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[7, 9]","I'm game for most things Disney, so when I saw ""Disney Princess: A Christmas of Enchantment,"" I thought it was worth a look. I wasn't disappointing, this is a great DVD for the holidays.This DVD features a packaging of content wrapped around theatrical stage and narration by the Disney princesses. It also includes a couple of neat songs from them, such as a Disney princess version of ""The Twelve Days of Christmas.""The stories are generally things that have been seen in past productions, but since I hadn't seen of it before, I enjoyed it and it made me want to check out some more of it. My favorite was the content from ""Beauty and the Beast: An Enchanted Christmas."" This is a sweet story about the time Belle put together a Christmas celebration during the time when the castle was still under the spell. This is a shortened version of the tale, but is told very nicely by Belle and it's a good edit. The other story featuring a Disney princess was a Christmas tale (I believe pulled from one of the learning DVDs.) about how Ariel and her friends celebrated ""Chrissymas."" It's a cute, funny little story.The other content is stuff that some people may call old and boring, but I call classic. It includes a silent (as in no dialogue) retelling of the story of the Tin Soldier and a few other such classic Disney pieces, some silent, some not. This was stuff largely made in the early Disney days and while it lacks some of the flash of today's films, the stories are still strong. While I enjoy today's animation, you have to work with what you have, and these are a great example of doing the best with that.So, if I truly think this DVD is enchanting, then you may be wondering why I gave it four stars and not five. That would be because of the special features. While this DVD does have a couple half-way decent special features, I believe DVDs must have truly great special features in order to earn a five-star rating from me.",4,My Vote is For Truly Enchanting!,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,1941,"[""'m"", 'game', 'most', 'things', 'Disney', 'when', 'saw', 'Disney', 'Princess', 'Christmas', 'Enchantment', 'thought', 'was', 'worth', 'look', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointing', 'great', 'DVD', 'holidays.This', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'content', 'wrapped', 'theatrical', 'stage', 'narration', 'Disney', 'princesses', 'also', 'couple', 'neat', 'songs', 'such', 'Disney', 'princess', 'version', 'Twelve', 'Days', 'Christmas', 'stories', 'are', 'generally', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'past', 'productions', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'made', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'more', 'My', 'favorite', 'was', 'content', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Enchanted', 'Christmas', 'sweet', 'story', 'time', 'Belle', 'put', 'together', 'Christmas', 'celebration', 'time', 'when', 'castle', 'was', 'still', 'spell', 'shortened', 'version', 'tale', 'told', 'very', 'nicely', 'Belle', 'good', 'edit', 'other', 'story', 'featuring', 'Disney', 'princess', 'was', 'Christmas', 'tale', 'believe', 'pulled', 'one', 'learning', 'DVDs', 'how', 'Ariel', 'friends', 'celebrated', 'Chrissymas', 'cute', 'funny', 'little', 'story.The', 'other', 'content', 'stuff', 'people', 'may', 'call', 'old', 'boring', 'call', 'classic', 'silent', 'dialogue', 'retelling', 'story', 'Tin', 'Soldier', 'few', 'other', 'such', 'classic', 'Disney', 'pieces', 'silent', 'not', 'was', 'stuff', 'largely', 'made', 'early', 'Disney', 'days', 'flash', 'today', 'films', 'stories', 'are', 'still', 'strong', 'enjoy', 'today', 'animation', 'have', 'work', 'what', 'have', 'are', 'great', 'example', 'doing', 'best', 'that.So', 'truly', 'think', 'DVD', 'enchanting', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'not', 'five', 'would', 'be', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'have', 'couple', 'half-way', 'decent', 'special', 'features', 'believe', 'DVDs', 'must', 'have', 'truly', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'order', 'earn', 'five-star', 'rating']",Disney Princess - A Christmas of Enchantment

909778,A23AFVXWF9A0CF,B0009OUB2O,Sallie A. Neal,"[73, 81]","Disney Princess- A Christmas Enchantment was just that- an enchantment. My daughter who is 5 and a Disney Princess guru was not disappointed unlike many of the reviewers here. I don't know quite what they expected, but this dvd is wonderful for young Princesses in training. We are not D.P amateurs, this review is coming from a mother and daughter who have been to Disney Princesses on Ice, own all the Disney Princess movies, books and whatever else you can get. Many people are claiming how awful it was, but few are actually explaining why. I will explain why it's not bad as many have come to think.The dvd opens with a beautiful grand entrance which the viewer is a part of. You take your seat in the grand theater and begin the journey with the Disney Princess' version of 12 Days of Christmas. You are then taken through several stories and songs in which the Princesses narrate, sprinkled with Old classic Disney Christmas cartoons. I did not find any of these cartoons inappropriate for my 5 year old. In fact, she watched them over and over again. It's sad to hear that the old cartoons are being labelled as filler or recycled material. Please remember that many of these Princesses are ""old""! Disney tried to make it enjoyable for both the child and the parent, and the nostalgic cartoons were a great bonus.One of my daughter's favorite parts of the dvd was the intermission. During the intermission, you are taken to a menu screen where you can choose a Princess to decorate a tree for. They give you choices for ornaments, tinsel and a tree topper based on the movie they appeared in. So not only are you decorating, but you are testing your Princess trivia skills. In the end, the trees glow and change color and the Princess whose tree was decorated sings a Christmas song for you.The Princesses were very clearly a part of this dvd unlike what one reviewer says. They are the narrators and all of the games and activities are about them, and they do appear on the screen. Just watch the beginning of the dvd and you will see them in the grand theater as well as throughout the dvd itself. I am very disappointed that so many reviewers are being so hard on this dvd. My daughter and I both love it and have watched it over and over again. It will definitely be something that she will have a memory of watching each Christmas.",5,Full of Real Christmas Enchantment,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,2344,"['Disney', 'Princess-', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Enchantment', 'was', 'just', 'that-', 'enchantment', 'daughter', 'who', '5', 'Disney', 'Princess', 'guru', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'expected', 'dvd', 'wonderful', 'young', 'Princesses', 'training', 'are', 'not', 'D.P', 'amateurs', 'review', 'coming', 'mother', 'daughter', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'Disney', 'Princesses', 'Ice', 'Disney', 'Princess', 'movies', 'books', 'else', 'can', 'get', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'claiming', 'how', 'awful', 'was', 'few', 'are', 'actually', 'explaining', 'why', 'will', 'explain', 'why', 'not', 'bad', 'many', 'have', 'come', 'think.The', 'dvd', 'beautiful', 'grand', 'entrance', 'viewer', 'part', 'take', 'seat', 'grand', 'theater', 'begin', 'journey', 'Disney', 'Princess', 'version', '12', 'Days', 'Christmas', 'are', 'then', 'taken', 'several', 'stories', 'songs', 'Princesses', 'narrate', 'sprinkled', 'Old', 'classic', 'Disney', 'Christmas', 'cartoons', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'cartoons', 'inappropriate', '5', 'year', 'old', 'fact', 'watched', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'sad', 'hear', 'old', 'cartoons', 'are', 'being', 'labelled', 'filler', 'recycled', 'material', 'Please', 'remember', 'many', 'Princesses', 'are', 'old', 'Disney', 'tried', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'child', 'parent', 'nostalgic', 'cartoons', 'were', 'great', 'bonus.One', 'daughter', 'favorite', 'parts', 'dvd', 'was', 'intermission', 'intermission', 'are', 'taken', 'menu', 'screen', 'where', 'can', 'choose', 'Princess', 'decorate', 'tree', 'give', 'choices', 'ornaments', 'tinsel', 'tree', 'topper', 'based', 'movie', 'appeared', 'So', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'decorating', 'are', 'testing', 'Princess', 'trivia', 'skills', 'end', 'trees', 'glow', 'change', 'color', 'Princess', 'tree', 'was', 'decorated', 'sings', 'Christmas', 'song', 'you.The', 'Princesses', 'were', 'very', 'clearly', 'part', 'dvd', 'what', 'one', 'reviewer', 'are', 'narrators', 'games', 'activities', 'are', 'do', 'appear', 'screen', 'Just', 'watch', 'beginning', 'dvd', 'will', 'see', 'grand', 'theater', 'as', 'well', 'dvd', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'are', 'being', 'so', 'hard', 'dvd', 'daughter', 'love', 'have', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'something', 'will', 'have', 'memory', 'watching', 'Christmas']",Disney Princess - A Christmas of Enchantment
909779,AVWCDSTES2RZY,B0009OUB2O,"That one guy - you know the one ""Dennis""","[42, 49]","Although it shouldn't really be a huge surprise that Disney will spare no expense, unless they can help it.  Previous Disney releases are all based on recycled Material, all the Princess Stories are either episodes from the ""Little Mermaid"" TV series, or Jasmine themed episodes of the ""Aladdin"" Television series, while all the new stories are usually just scenes, either still or short moving scenes, from a movie starring that princess.  Although this DVD does contain some new content, two new songs and new ""Animation"" it's basically all stuff that's been available previously.The ""New Animation"" is hard to explain, it's stiff, repetitive, and lifeless, although some of the cahracters original voices are here, others sound horrible, the voice of Snow White sounds like Fran Drescher with her nose welded shut and singing in a room full of helium.  Meanwhile, the ""New Songs"" are played with scenes from each princesses movie.Stories Include ""the Steadfast Tin Soldier"" - taken from Fantasia 2000""Aurora's Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy""- which just uses Aurora's dancing from ""Sleeping Beauty""- over and over and over-""Belle's Enchanted Christmas"" is justa condensed version of ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" but leaves out the villian, and most of the storyline.""A Merry Mermaid Christmas"" just has Ariel narrating ""Ariel's Undersea Christmas""- which is a story that was available in a ""Storybook with Tape"" set in the early nineties-The rest of the stories are either classic Diney cartoons, or music played out with scenes from Disney films.It's sad that Disney would trade their integrity for a quick buck out of the pockets of little girls, Dinsey  and Dinsey princess fans.I would advise that if you HAVE to see this movie, borrow it from a friend, it;s not even worht the rental money.  It's sad to see so many classic Dinsey characters cheapened by such a shotty release from a company that exudes creaticity and achievement.
