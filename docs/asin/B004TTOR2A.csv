It is an enjoyable look at children's TV of yesteryear. The production values show how far TV has come, in production.,and how little it has come in substance or content.

1427926,A2HMP6THXZZN3B,B004TTOR2A,Time Traveller,"[0, 0]","As a boy, I loved Paul Winchell and company. However, I was probably too young to see this version when it originally aired. I think Mr. Winchell is about the best ventriloquist I've ever seen. The main thing that made me rate this 3 stars rather than more was the barrage of commercials for Tootsie Rolls. It was built into the skits and even some of the costumes. If you can overlook that, you can still appreciate Paul Winchell's talent both with the ventriloquism and his creativity. A better choice would be Stop, Look, and Laugh a feature film released around 1960. It showcases winchell's talent interspersed with portions of Three Stooges episodes. Much more fun !",3,Ventriloquism at its best,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,672,"['boy', 'loved', 'Paul', 'Winchell', 'company', 'However', 'was', 'probably', 'too', 'young', 'see', 'version', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Winchell', 'best', 'ventriloquist', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'main', 'thing', 'made', 'rate', '3', 'stars', 'rather', 'more', 'was', 'barrage', 'commercials', 'Tootsie', 'Rolls', 'was', 'built', 'skits', 'even', 'costumes', 'can', 'overlook', 'can', 'still', 'appreciate', 'Paul', 'Winchell', 'talent', 'ventriloquism', 'creativity', 'better', 'choice', 'would', 'be', 'Stop', 'Look', 'Laugh', 'feature', 'film', 'released', '1960', 'winchell', 'talent', 'interspersed', 'portions', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Much', 'more', 'fun']",The Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney Show
