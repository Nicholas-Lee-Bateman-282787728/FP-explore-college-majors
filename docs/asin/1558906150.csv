179222,AMICVV9N2U2R4,1558906150,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[1, 1]","Full of spirit and character, the Brave Little Toaster is one of my favourite animated movies of all time. The rightful winner of the 1988 Parents' Choice Award, it has stood the test of time remarkably well. This is a moving story about loyalty and friendship through hardships, and I can recommend it without blinking.Five dated appliances in an old summer house finally get enough of waiting for their master to come back, and decide to go to the city to find him. While the big world is not a very inviting place for them, they're determined to find him at all cost. A very moving story, told with real heart. The characters are wonderful - the toaster is the leader, feeling responsible for the group. The radio likes to keep jabbering away, much to the annoyance of the lamp. The electric blanket - sort of the little kid of the group - is perhaps most eager to find the ""Master"". Then we have my favourite, Kirby the vacuum cleaner. He is tough and grumpy, but he has a soft side which he unsuccessfully tries to hide. These five characters captivate me and they are done good justice by animators who clearly did their homework.The music of this movie is wonderful as well. The four musical numbers are all very memorable -  the optimistic""City of Light"", the dramatic ""B-Movie"", the futuristic ""Cutting Edge"" and the melancholically beautiful ""Worthless"". All wonderful. Exciting, scary but above all moving and captivating, the Brave Little Toaster is one of those truly deserved classics.

179245,AVGX4BYF7J559,1558906150,"Jer ""kingjer151""","[0, 1]","SynopsisThis movie is from the book with the same title by Thomas M. Disch and the movie was directed by Jerry Rees. Toaster, Lampy, Blanky, Kirby, and Radio live in a cottage just outside the city. They are devastated when they learn that the cottage is going to be sold and never see their master ever again. Toasters idea is to set out and find the master and be with him again but its a dangerous place out there for appliances. Will they be able to find the master in the big city and brave the perils of nature?Plot RatingI found this movie and plot to be very cute. There are some songs (B Movie is great), cute scenes, and a crazy clown dream sequence that I won't even get into but if you've ever seen the movie you know what I'm talking about. The movie also has some bad things that happen to the appliances (Kirby having a seizure) that are rather adult and I'm not sure that kids today appreciate the horrible dreams we may have had because of it. Kids today have it so lucky with their Hannah Montanah, icarly, and Jonas Brothers. I give the plot an 8 out of 10Actors/ActressesDeanna Oliver plays toaster and she does a good job at playing a strong willed, leader that will do anything to be with the master once again. Thurl Ravenscroft plays the grumpy Kirby who drags the appliances through the woods, dirt, mud, and eventually to the masters door. He pushes the other appliances to the side but secretly likes them and cares about them. Timothy E. Day plays Blanky and the youngest of the appliances. There's nothing special about this character and isn't even that likable. The only thing I would say that he has going for him is his innocence and naivety. Timothy Stack plays Lampy and isn't that bright. You'd think he would know that getting hit with lighting was a bad thing. Jon Lovitz plays Radio and is the comedic character in the movie. He's a quick witted, fast talking, appliance that has a lot of stories and leads them through the wood and to the city to find the master. He may not always be telling the truth though. I give the acting a 9/10DVD ExtrasThis movie comes from Walt Disney home entertainment and there are no extras on the DVD, which is a pity because I would have liked to see the recording of them doing the voices and an interview with the original writer and director but one can only dream. I give the extras a 0/10.Personal ThoughtsI don't remember a lot of my childhood so I can't say I saw this movie when I was little but I do remember it. The movie is a nice way to recap into your subconscious and remember all the times you sat down and watched a scary clown try to drown the toaster or sang the songs to the movie. All the voice actors did a good job with their characters even if some of them weren't that important (Blanky). My friend and I have discussed this movie a lot and we both agree that children today shouldn't be subjected to such horrible actions that happen to these appliances. Although, I doubt they would be as affected as we were with all the violence that is on television and movies today. If you want something that will take you back and entertain you at the same time then I suggest this movie. Also, if your looking for something to distract your kids and give you a break from their incessant screaming then I suggest this movie.Overall, this movie gets a 17/30. A mediocre score but that's what happens when you don't add any extras to a DVD which could have been more than feasible.

I also (See, reviewers do read other reviewers' opinions!) agree that the sequels didn't quite live up to the original, but sequels seldom do...and I agree that there are some scary parts, or - to a 3 year old - even 'sad' parts, such as when Toaster gets pretty banged up as he rescues all of the other appliances, etc. But all of these thoughts and points cannot take away from the fact that this is a clever, cute little movie that I recommend highly to anybody who asks me about it when they see it on our shelf. The plot is discussed in great detail in many of the other reviews, and so I will just add my personal opinion to this list, as a mom. I should mention that my son is autistic and mentally disabled, by the way, and so I have to be very, very careful with what I buy, so that he will not be unnecessarily upset, frightened, etc., and he has done more than fine with TBLT and its' sequels. Perhaps it is an autistic individual's tendency to see things in an unusual way that he never thought the plot - a toaster for the hero, and a bunch of talking appliances? - silly or too offbeat. And I will admit to sitting down and watching it with him and friends' kids, and never once looking at my watch or thinking, ""Oh, god, not again."" That says something when you consider there have been Disney movies (uh,'Chicken Little') when I seriously hoped that I would choke on my popcorn, if it would get me out of that movie theatre sooner than later. Cute movie, and for adults, the late, great Phil Hartman does Jack Nicholson as an air-conditioner, and it's hilarious.

He's now 13 and when it was on TV recently, he sat down to watch it again with his little brother who is 2 1/2 years old.  It's a delightful, sometimes sad, and a little scary, tale of several appliances who come to life and try to get home to their master, a young man named Rob.It seems that the appliances have all been left behind in an old cottage and the cottage is soon to be sold.  The five appliances: Radio (Jon Lovitz), Lampy (Tim Stack), Kirby the vacuum Cleaner (Thurl Ravenscroft, voice of Tony the Tiger) Blanky the electic blanket (Timothy Day) and the Toaster (Deanna Oliver.  Phil Hartman does the voice of the Air conditioner at the cottage who tells the other appliances they are going to be left behind.They tie a car battery to an office chair and plug in Kirby as he pulls the rest of the appliances like a wagon.  Literally over hill, dale, and river, the comrades face a world of peril including ""the collector"" who takes apart old appliances and sells parts, a dangerous waterfall, and the climax at a junk yard.A very cute little Movie NOT made by Disney although Hyperion pictures would eventually be acquired by Disney.  The movie was based on a story by renowned sci-fi and Horror author Thomas M. Disch who gives us a modern day fable.  The voice actors, particularly Lovitz and Ravenscroft are outstanding and the animation is quite good considering it was done in the 1980's when studios were not spending a great deal on quality animation.This would be followed up by two sequels: The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars and The Brave Little Toaster to the rescue.

Additionally, the conflicts and some of the suspenseful situations mirror experiences that little ones have in their day to day experience.My only complaint is that the sequels produced aren't up to the high quality of the first film. While the third film in the series (but second produced) The Brave Little Toaster Goes To Mars is very close in quality to the first film, the second film suffers from a lower budget and is missing the imaginative direction of the first film.As to the viewer who mentioned that there were images inappropriate for younger children--honestly, my kids can't operate the pause button and never noticed the ""image"". It isn't nasty or subversive and I find it doesn't effect the overall quality of this fine children's film. The cliche about not being able to see the woods for the tree applies to children's movies as well.
