744889,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00008LUNW,A Customer,"[1, 4]","Summary:Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley; young Kyle - Joshua Anderson (I)) lives in the town of Darkness Falls (ridiculously stupid name, but I'll get to that later) where a curse caused by the quasi-accidental hanging of one of the town's residents has left children who lose their teeth in fear for their lives.  The curse was put on the town by an elderly lady who used to exchange the children's teeth with baked goods or money (the origins of the tooth fairy legend).  She was mistakenly accused of having killed two of the town's children when, in fact, she had not.  Years prior to the hanging she had suffered some terrible misfortunes, including the burning of her home in which she was badly disfigured.  As a result of the disfigurement she never left her home but at night and even then only when wearing a porcelain mask.Now Kyle is just losing the last of his baby teeth and knowing the curse, he tries his best not to look at the tooth fairy when she arrives to get his teeth, but he just can't help himself - he pulls out a flashlight and shines it on her.  The curse declares that if anyone sees her face she'll kill them.  Well, Kyle saw her face, but because he is in the light, which hurts her if she enters it, she can't kill him, so she kills his mom (Rebecca McCauley) instead.  Kyle is taken away and everyone in the town seems to accuse him of his mother's death, except his girlfriend at the time, Caitlin 'Cat' Greene (Emma Caulfield; young Caitlin - Emily Browning) who, for some reason, can't seem to get over him.A number of years later Caitlin's younger brother, Michael (Lee Cormie), is losing his baby teeth and has seen The Tooth Fairy.  He is afraid of the dark and refuses to sleep knowing that she'll get him if he does.  Caitlin, apparently at her wit's end, calls Kyle to see if he can help. Kyle returns to Darkness Falls from Las Vegas and upon arriving in the town seems to call forth from the townspeople years of pent up rage (for no apparent reason).  What's more, no one believes him about The Tooth Fairy except Michael until the Tooth Fairy starts killing everyone.Eventually Kyle is able to save Michael from certain death and ushers both Michael and Caitlin to the local lighthouse where they commence a standoff with The Tooth Fairy in which Kyle ultimately prevails, breaking the curse and ridding Darkness Falls from the 'evil' Tooth Fairy.My Comments:The one thing this movie has going for it is what a friend of mine likes to call 'mental real estate', everyone has heard of the tooth fairy.  But that is where the real estate ends.  This has to be the worst movie I have seen this year and ranks right up next to Final Destination 1 and The Perfect Storm as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.First, the premise - A Tooth Fairy gone bad?  Come on!  My wife and I laughed for almost 10 minutes straight when we realized that we were watching a 'horror' movie about an evil Tooth Fairy.  Bloodsucking monsters, ghosts, zombies, vampires, even possessed cats and dolls are scarier than an 'evil Tooth Fairy'.  This has to be the worst premise for a horror movie of all time!As for the story...  I think my summary is actually clearer then the story you witness in the movie.  The movie jumps from location to location and makes absolutely no sense.  There is no reason for Caitlin to still love Kyle.  Kyle has no reason to return to Darkness Falls.  Michael seems to have some uncanny knowledge about Kyle's experiences with the Tooth Fairy as though he were possessed.  And the fight scene in the bar, please!  What was the cause of that?  Why did some guy just walk up to Kyle and throw his beer on him?  Of course Kyle then has to be immediately arrested not once, but twice in the same night so they can take his flashlights away from him.  And the set up for the ending, Caitlin reading some book about how some banshee was banished by using a 'really bright light', when will this ever end?  I was literally appalled that this story was made into a movie and, what's more, that I wasted even the smallest amount of my time watching it.The acting... Don't get me started.  There wasn't one good actor in this movie, except, perhaps, for Michael.  The rest of the characters were ridiculously stereotyped and even more poorly portrayed.  Even the Tooth Fairy did silly things and she was computer generated.  There are no big names in this movie and it is obvious why - because this movie sucked.  Did you hear me correctly?  This is a terrible movie.  As I mentioned, Michael might be plausibly considered the only decent actor of the film, but he had to read such horrible lines that I just felt sorry for him; perhaps I mistook my sorrow for decent acting, I don't know.  I'm actually surprised I'm able to write a review of this film because I'm trying so hard to forget it.  The Kyles, both old and young, were horrible; the Caitlins too.  Larry, the lawyer, was such a horrible stereotype I couldn't believe someone would write something so infantile.Overall, this is a horrible movie.  The premise is ridiculous, there is no real story, and the acting is beyond dreadful.  There was one redeeming quality, however, to this DVD (thank goodness I watched it on DVD and for free to boot), and that is the featurette about the true story on which the movie is based.  Yes, you heard me correct, this is actually based on a legend from Australia.  I had no idea.  And just so you know, you would be better off watching the featurette than the movie because it is more interesting and better made then the movie.  In fact, don't watch the movie, just watch the featurette and save yourself the agony.  I don't recommend this film, even if someone pays you a lot of money to watch it!!!",1,The tooth-fairy gone bad?

744890,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00008LUNW,A. Estes,"[1, 4]","""Darkness Falls"" is notorious for one thing: being one of the most underwhelming horror films of 2003. You can thank the studio behind it for that. The ghost story with a tooth fairy twist had its teeth knocked out one by one during its production and in spite of the efforts of director Jonathan Liebesman to rise above it, one can't help but feel cheated by the film, which barely clocks in at 80 minutes.When he was twelve years old, Kyle (Chaney Kley) was terrorized by the blood-thirsty spirit of Matilda Dixon. A child-loving, sun-fearing old woman with an apparent fetish for teeth, Matilda was mistakenly murdered by the local townspeople and now stalks children upon the loss of their last baby tooth as a form of revenge. A decade down the line and Kyle - now a mopey 20-something who spends his free-time popping pills, collecting flashlights and brooding alongside some generic hard rock - finds himself returning home to assist his childhood sweetheart (Emma Caulfield) whose child is being haunted by the same spirit.Despite its strong opening, ""Darkness Falls"" is a mess of a film seemingly in a rush to reach its conclusion. Rather than spend time on developing its characters, the film instead casts them off as quickly as possible, leaving little room for suspense or, you know, genuine horror. While the gorgeous cinematography goes a long way in establishing an appropriately foreboding atmosphere, the film resorts to cheap gags such as fast editing and jarring sound effects to get its jollies. It's also worth noting that the film is also host to one of the most face-palm inducing cat-jumping-into-frame scares. Liebesman has a great eye and tries his hardest, but at the end of the day, the film feels incomplete and hollow. If the studio intended to deliver a film that looks good but features nothing below the surface, then consider it a job well done. For the rest of us, it's about as scary as a routine trip to the dentist.",2,Mediocrity Falls.,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,1954,"['Darkness', 'Falls', 'notorious', 'one', 'thing', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'underwhelming', 'horror', 'films', '2003', 'can', 'thank', 'studio', 'ghost', 'story', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'twist', 'had', 'teeth', 'knocked', 'out', 'one', 'one', 'production', 'spite', 'efforts', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Liebesman', 'rise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'cheated', 'film', 'barely', '80', 'minutes.When', 'was', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'Kyle', 'Chaney', 'Kley', 'was', 'terrorized', 'blood-thirsty', 'spirit', 'Matilda', 'Dixon', 'child-loving', 'sun-fearing', 'old', 'woman', 'apparent', 'fetish', 'teeth', 'Matilda', 'was', 'mistakenly', 'murdered', 'local', 'townspeople', 'now', 'children', 'loss', 'last', 'baby', 'tooth', 'form', 'revenge', 'decade', 'down', 'line', 'Kyle', 'now', 'mopey', '20-something', 'who', 'free-time', 'popping', 'pills', 'collecting', 'flashlights', 'brooding', 'alongside', 'generic', 'hard', 'rock', 'returning', 'home', 'assist', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'child', 'being', 'haunted', 'same', 'spirit.Despite', 'strong', 'opening', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'mess', 'film', 'seemingly', 'rush', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'Rather', 'spend', 'time', 'developing', 'characters', 'film', 'instead', 'off', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'leaving', 'little', 'room', 'suspense', 'know', 'genuine', 'horror', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'long', 'way', 'establishing', 'appropriately', 'foreboding', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'resorts', 'cheap', 'gags', 'such', 'fast', 'editing', 'jarring', 'sound', 'effects', 'get', 'jollies', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'film', 'also', 'host', 'one', 'most', 'face-palm', 'inducing', 'cat-jumping-into-frame', 'scares', 'Liebesman', 'great', 'eye', 'hardest', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'feels', 'incomplete', 'hollow', 'studio', 'intended', 'deliver', 'film', 'good', 'nothing', 'surface', 'then', 'consider', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'rest', 'as', 'scary', 'routine', 'trip', 'dentist']",N/A

744893,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B00008LUNW,Amanda,"[3, 8]","Possibly one of the worst ""horror"" films ever made, 'Darkness Falls' goes from a fairly interesting beginning to an incredibly bad middle and end. I have to be honest - I'm a little uncertain of a lot of the events that happened in the middle and end, because I was so unbelievably bored by that time that I'm pretty sure I blacked out.I couldn't wait to rent 'Darkess Falls' because I had high expectations for it. Okay, well maybe not that high, but I expected it to be at least half-way decent. But guess what? It wasn't even a quarter of the way decent. The premise was great: the tooth fairy as an evil, murderous tooth-stealer. She's hideously scarred from a fire, and she wears a mask. Just like in 'Halloween'! And 'Friday the 13th'! And 'Scream'! How original. So, this tooth fairy chick flys around, looking for kids who have just lost some baby teeth. When she finds them, she trades the tooth for money. But if any of the kids open their eyes and looks at her, she kills them. Hmm. Kind of makes you glad you're out of that tooth-losing phase, huh? Okay, now it's starting to sound dumb. That's because it IS dumb. And on top of that, the acting is not good at all. The only recognizable person in the whole film is Emma Caulfield (as the main character Caitlin), who I adore as Anya on 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', but here she just struggles through a bad script. The film is less than an hour and a half, yet it feels like an eternity before it's finally over. And when it's done, you applaud, because it means that you can now go do something more meaningful with your time. If you're in the mood for a good scare, don't be fooled into renting or buying this one, because it's not that scary. Get 'The Ring' instead. A lot of people say that one's not that scary either, but at least it's got more of a plot, and it won't make you want to bash your head against a wall.",1,Darkness Falls Flat,1051401600,"04 27, 2003",2003,1884,"['Possibly', 'one', 'worst', 'horror', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Falls', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'beginning', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'middle', 'end', 'have', 'be', 'honest', ""'m"", 'little', 'uncertain', 'lot', 'events', 'happened', 'middle', 'end', 'was', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'bored', 'time', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'blacked', 'out.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'rent', ""'Darkess"", 'Falls', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'Okay', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'high', 'expected', 'be', 'least', 'half-way', 'decent', 'guess', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'quarter', 'way', 'decent', 'premise', 'was', 'great', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'evil', 'murderous', 'tooth-stealer', 'hideously', 'scarred', 'fire', 'mask', 'Just', ""'Halloween"", '13th', 'How', 'original', 'So', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'chick', 'flys', 'looking', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'lost', 'baby', 'teeth', 'When', 'tooth', 'money', 'kids', 'open', 'eyes', 'Hmm', 'Kind', 'glad', ""'re"", 'tooth-losing', 'phase', 'huh', 'Okay', 'now', 'starting', 'sound', 'dumb', 'dumb', 'top', 'acting', 'not', 'good', 'only', 'recognizable', 'person', 'whole', 'film', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'main', 'character', 'Caitlin', 'who', 'adore', 'Anya', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'here', 'just', 'through', 'bad', 'script', 'film', 'less', 'hour', 'half', 'eternity', 'finally', 'when', 'done', 'applaud', 'can', 'now', 'go', 'do', 'something', 'more', 'meaningful', 'time', ""'re"", 'mood', 'good', 'scare', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'renting', 'buying', 'one', 'not', 'scary', 'Get', ""'The"", 'Ring', 'instead', 'lot', 'people', 'say', 'one', 'not', 'scary', 'least', 'got', 'more', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'want', 'bash', 'head', 'wall']",N/A

744895,A13RYFCGR7AM7E,B00008LUNW,"Andrew Thompson ""a.k.a. Jake Kincaid, Jack of...","[3, 4]","Wow...there's a whole lotta hatin' goin' on in THIS place, I see...Well, while the majority of you are sharpening your pitchforks and lighting your torches, I'll take advantage of the opportunity to put MY two cents in on this little flick.I loved this movie. I thought the concept was good (I mean, why do we assume the tooth fairy looks like Tinkerbell and is just inherently friendly?

Why is it easy to accept an undead revenant with a hockey mask haunts a summer camp, but not the idea that there is a supernatural being that must conform to a set of celestial rules?), and the cinematography was positively chilling (the scene near the beginning in the hallway outside the safety of the bright bathroom is the stuff of Lovecraftian nightmares).Preying on our inherent fear of the dark was a masterstroke...and I've read the complaints about how light was her downfall, but lightning didn't bother her...well, why do we swallow that in some vampire movies crosses ward away the villains, but in others they can use them as toothpicks?Add to that element the use of the tooth fairy, as aforementioned a friendly and ""safe"" element of almost all of our childhoods, weaving her legends of how you must be asleep and never see her into something sinister, and you have a very scary movie.I look at any horror film in the respect of 'does it scare me?

I am 14 and I found this movie quite boring and not scary at all. First off, their are many mindless glitches and the story always falls apart. First off, common sense, who would have the brains to live in a tiwn called Darkness Falls? 2nd, if the tooth fairy kills every child that loses their last tooth, how come no one else in the town is dead? I mean, really. 3rd, why is the tooth fairy all of a sudden spazing out and killing everyone? I mean, 2 or 3 deaths are fine, but when it comes to grabbing doctors and police men and throwing them everywhere the movie doesn't really make sense anymore. The beginning was okay, but after that, it's really stupid. Even when people are in the light they get killed. And &quot;stay in the light&quot; kind of starts to drag on after he says it 100 times. This movie is not very well thought out and not put together well at all. The cast is as boring as a ball of yarn and the story is, well, there really is no story. If you want a good horror movie see The Excorcist, Silence of the Lambs, Halloween, Candyman, Psycho or the Shining, but don't waste your time with this junk.

What disappoints me the most is when there is something there that could of been done and used effectively, but the writers and director don't know what they have and water it down and turn it into the most preposerous, neandering drivel. That is the feeling with this underdeveloped film that feels like it was barely even written in script form and slapped together in a real quick hatchett job. Yes, there was something here that could of been something. I think that is obvious, and to the film's credit, there were a few parts here and there that were quite creepy and spooky. The movie begins a few years ago and we see a little boy who is having trouble sleeping. He has lost a tooth and while thinking the Tooth Fairy is coming, is scared of the dark and shadows in his room. After the opening minutes that include a tragedy and what was a promising start, the movie flashes to present day and the little boy is now grown up. His name is Klye(played by Chaney Kley), and he returns to his hometown after getting a call from an old schildhood friend named Caitlin(Played By Buffy's superb Emma Caufield), whose little brother is experiencing the same fears and trauma that Klye did all those years ago. He reluctantly comes to help, and things are set in motion. The Tooth Fairy was an old woman named Matilda Dixon, who years and years earlier, was a kindly woman who made cookies and gave treats to the town's children. She was horribly disfigured in a fire and became a recluse. When children began to disappear, the town blamed the disfigured old woman and hunt her down. Now, decades later, she is back for her revenge. It's quite a silly premise, but it is something that could of been shaped into a better idea if it had been in the hands of more capable writers. Which it isn't. Horror cliches also abound mightily in the flick. The clueless police, the buddy cop who tries to help, the ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend, fake scares and jumps. You get the picture. Emma Caufield is so good as Anya on &quot;Buffy&quot;, and so it is with a big disappointment that she is wasted in a nothing role in a nothing movie. She is so much better than this. Seriously, there is nothing to the role and nothing for her to do. Don't they know what a horror heroine should have?. Chaney Kley(nice name), is a generic, right off the assembly line hero. His acting is wooden and he seems to be reading &quot;Acting In Horror Movies For Dummies&quot;. The acting isn't without some merit. The little boy who played Caitlin's brother was actually very good. So where the little ones playing Kyle and Caitlin. That's about it. Stan Winston did a fine job with the look of The Tooth Fairy, but this is small fry for him. The Tooth Fairy herself is actually creepy and at times scary. There was potential in the character and there were enough decent chills and creeps to show that there might have been hope at one point, but the project ultimately fails on every front.

Darkness Falls starts off like it's going to have a *ton* of potential, and then it completely collapses 20 minutes later.A world of potential completely disregarded.  That about sums up Darkness Falls.The first 20 minutes shows a little boy in his bedroom.  His girlfriend sneaks in, they kiss, she leaves, and then soon after, the boy sees his mother being killed by an actual witch who apparently enters homes whenever it turns dark.The storyline then shifts to making sure the main characters are NEVER staying in complete darkness for too long, because then the witch would come and kill them instantly.The problem?  After the first 20 minutes, the storyline shifts to a little boy in a mental institution, and the storyline feels like it gets completely stuck in this rut with absolutely no suspense or interest whatsoever.  No suspenseful witch appearances, no interesting storyline taking place, nothing.Eventually, like an hour later, the witch continues her relentless hunt to kill people who are stuck in the dark.  This is when another problem occurs- the atmosphere you experienced in the very beginning of the film is completely gone by this point, and it *never* comes back again, even when you believe the suspense will finally return towards the end of the movie.So the remainder of the movie is basically like a cheesy action flick showing the innocent people try to escape with their lives.  It's just really silly, and the storyline makes a witch seem laughable by its conclusion instead of what appeared (according to the intro scene) to be a really intimidating creature.I'm giving this film two stars because the opening 20 minutes really were THAT good.

This I had to see. And as it turned out, ""Darkness Falls"", was a little scary, though only because it worries me that such a vapid film ever got made at all.The premise is half good (playing off of the natural human fear of the dark seemed like a good psychological tool), and half bad (the tooth fairy? gimme a break). At the beginning and the end are two very effective ""shock-value"" scenes. In between them, though, the only thing that this movie supplies is a few cynical laughs at the predictable and totally wanton series of deaths that passes for a plot. Every single expendible character is knocked off, making for a death rate of one every thirty seconds through about half the movie (I exaggerate only slightly). The ghost (who, despite being dead, possesses all the qualities of a living creature including the ability to die) swoops down (think the flying reptiles in ""Jurassic Park 3"") and carries people off left and right, lending a ridiculous action-movie quality to the film. Electricity and all other forms of artificial light fail unsurpisingly at every turn. And it's not scary. At all. The script is lifeless, the characters more one-dimensional than a photograph of a cardboard mannequinn, most of the acting light-years from the way real people would respond to a situation.

We all harbor our own individual thoughts and views on different themes of discussion and that, in essence, is what makes diversity so wonderful.Many legions of horror fans critically castrated ""Darkness Falls"" upon its initial release. Why that transpired is something I will probably never comprehend. Had I taken all the mad ravings of people who believed this movie was so utterly wretched at face value, I would have gone ahead with the foolhardy assumption that it really was as ""lame"" and ""stupid"" as they claimed. That, however, was not the case. ""Darkness Falls"" is very possibly the single most misunderstood and under-appreciated feature to have seen a major release in recent years. My spouse and I sat through the entire viewing and came away with the combined opinion that there was, in all honesty, not one single thing wrong with this movie. I found Jonathan Liebesman's debut as a director quite impressive. His approach to the story was refreshingly frank and straightforward. He took the time-honored myth of the Tooth Fairy and created a monster that truly terrifies and gives us ample reason to fear the dark.Horror fans constantly whine that it got a ""PG-13"" instead of an ""R."" They appearently went into this production expecting a Tarantino-style bloodbath, and that is not what any frame of this film was intended to represent. What specifically irritates me is the fact that anybody who enjoyed ""Darkness Falls"" automatically had their integrity as a ""true horror fan"" called into question. This happens rather more frequently than you may imagine. You can visit any message board that deals directly with the horror genre and see the mud-slinging firsthand. I look at shameful behavior like that and find I can do nothing but simply shake my head in total contempt.Regardless of what anyone might say to the contrary, this was a decently made and fun-filled horror ride.

He swears he didn't do it  -  that the real culprit was the ""Tooth Fairy,"" a local ghost-witch/boogeyman, who takes childrens' last baby teeth but relentlessly pursues them to death if they are so presumptuous as to steal a peek at her disfigured visage.  Now an adult, Kyle can't get through a single night without a flashlight, because the Tooth Fairy can't strike in anything but darkness.Kyle's old childhood flame, Caitlin Greene (Emma Caulfield), tracks down Kyle and solicits his return to Darkness Falls to help her kid brother, Michael (Lee Cormie), who  -  like Kyle  -  suffers from insomnia due to night-terrors.  Neither she, nor her lawyer fiancee Larry (Grant Piro) believe in Kyle's ""Tooth Fairy""  -  nor do the local constabulary, when another body turns up in Kyle's vicinity.  But their skepticism diminishes, when the Tooth Fairy becomes more aggressive in her pursuit of Kyle and Michael, soon threatening the entire town of Darkness Falls.This movie is short on logic, but long on scares.  It's an old-fashioned horror film of famous last words  -  ""See?  There was nothing there!""  -  which are invariably the cue for the Tooth Fairy to swoop down out of the shadows at lightning speed, thence to abduct her victims to isolated locations for murder and mayhem.Director Jonathan Liebesman makes the most of light and shadows, and of a great, unsettling soundtrack that underlies the entire proceedings.  Experienced monster-maker Stan Winston provides the genuinely grisly and unsettling Tooth Fairy, almost scarier in her featureless Gray-alien ghost mask than in her later-revealed grotesquely fire-scarred visage.  The production is gorgeous, and the cast are really terrific  -  especially principals Kley and Caulfield (the latter fresh from her role as Anya in the popular series Buffy the Vampire Slayer), and Lee Cormie as the earnestly intense suffering little boy.  The imagery is nightmarishly unsettling, and highly memorable.The whole thing comes in at just 75 minutes, making it one hell of a fast and furious ride.  Don't question it.  Just jump on, and hold tight.  It's a perfect popcorn movie: meant for quick consumption, not at all thought-provoking, and intended for thrills only.Bring a date.

744916,A21T2ZAT0QA0KO,B00008LUNW,ChildInside,"[0, 1]","I am a former horror movie junkie. I've been addicted to horror movies for a good 10 years of my life. Recently, I stopped caring about horror movies. Why? Because horror movies nowadays suck. I remember watching GOOD horror movies such as the original House On Haunted Hill, Wolf Man, or Nosferatu. Sure, these movies weren't scary (how many horror movies actually are), but they had class.Nowadays, people consider movies like Resident Evil scary. What? Who in their right mind considers that scary? Does RE have a good story? No. Does RE have good characters? No. Is Milla Jovovich hot? No. Does RE deserve a sequel? No. Did it get one? Sadly, yes.Movies just aren't what they used to be. Sure, there are a few surprises every now and then, like the House On Haunted Hill remake, or The Ring, but that just isn't enough.And, of course, Darkness Falls isn't exactly gold either.Right from the start, you can already tell that this movie screwed itself. To begin, the movie clearly says that the ""tooth fairy"" will kill anybody that has seen her face. This wonderful fact that the movie provided us with was immediately screwed up when Kyle's mother, who hadn't see the fairy at all, was killed. Then there's also the fact that everyone she had killed later on never really seen her face at all. They only saw her mask.You can also tell from the moment they showed Caitlin with her brother that the story was going to be corny. As a matter of fact, before I even seen the movie, I bet myself that I could guess what would happen.I guessed that what will happen is that Kyle, the main character, will be so racked with guilt about his ""ex-girlfriend"" and her brother (who amazingly knew ALL about Kyle's experience as a child without no one ever telling him and who also immediately liked him for no reason at all) that he will come back to protect them even though he is terrified of the tooth fairy. Somewhere along the way, Michael will be trapped by tooth fairy and Caitlin or, the more likely, Kyle will jump out of nowhere and rescue him, then as they run away, the tooth fairy will just stay there to look at them for a moment before chasing after them. All throughout the movie, the tooth fairy will have an incredibly hard time catching them even though, logically, she should have done it easily. Finally, at the end, Kyle will find a way to trap and kill her, then he and Caitlin kisses and they all live happily ever after. Hey, maybe Larry will be killed or Michael will even do some brave act just to add to the corniness.That was my prediction for Darkness Falls. Can you guess how close I was? If you said 95%, then you are correct!When I finished the movie, there were plot holes galore! And that was just from the first viewing! I haven't seen so many plot holes since Home Alone 4! But before I talk about the plot holes, let see how correct my predictions were.About Kyle being racked with guilt, that part is debatable. It doesn't show that he feels guilty for long, but why else would he come back after saying no? And it seems I was right about the second part. Michael and (as an added bonus) Caitlin was trapped, not once, but TWICE! And Kyle saved them both times. Isn't that terrific? And as for the tooth fairy standing still to watch them run away, it didn't happen immediately, but it did eventually happen just when she had Kyle trapped. All throughout the movie, it was shown that the tooth fairy moves very fast, yet she slows down immensely just when the opportunity to catch Kyle and the others pop up. The only part I was wrong about was Kyle and Caitlin kissing, but they did live happily ever after.Oh, and guess what? Larry was killed.Now on to the plot holes. All throughout the movie, it was also shown that the tooth fairy couldn't stand a bit of light, no matter how thin or weak the light is. So if this is the case, then how was she able to attack those hospital staff members during their run through the hallway? And why was she able to attack the cop and Kyle near the end even those they had light with them? And why is she able to stand the lightning? It illuminates everything almost as well as the freaking lighthouse!This movie just plain sucks.",1,Steve Tyler's mouth scared me more than this movie,1095897600,"09 23, 2004",2004,4198,"['am', 'former', 'horror', 'movie', 'junkie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'addicted', 'horror', 'movies', 'good', '10', 'years', 'life', 'Recently', 'stopped', 'caring', 'horror', 'movies', 'Why', 'horror', 'movies', 'suck', 'remember', 'watching', 'GOOD', 'horror', 'movies', 'such', 'original', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'Wolf', 'Man', 'Nosferatu', 'Sure', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'scary', 'how', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'actually', 'are', 'had', 'class.Nowadays', 'people', 'consider', 'movies', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'scary', 'What', 'Who', 'right', 'mind', 'considers', 'scary', 'Does', 'RE', 'have', 'good', 'story', 'No', 'RE', 'have', 'good', 'characters', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'hot', 'No', 'RE', 'deserve', 'sequel', 'No', 'Did', 'get', 'one', 'Sadly', 'yes.Movies', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'be', 'Sure', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'now', 'then', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'remake', 'Ring', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough.And', 'course', 'Darkness', 'Falls', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'gold', 'either.Right', 'start', 'can', 'already', 'tell', 'movie', 'screwed', 'begin', 'movie', 'clearly', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'will', 'kill', 'anybody', 'seen', 'face', 'wonderful', 'fact', 'movie', 'provided', 'was', 'immediately', 'screwed', 'up', 'when', 'Kyle', 'mother', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'see', 'fairy', 'was', 'killed', 'Then', 'also', 'fact', 'everyone', 'had', 'killed', 'later', 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'face', 'only', 'saw', 'mask.You', 'can', 'also', 'tell', 'moment', 'showed', 'Caitlin', 'brother', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'corny', 'matter', 'fact', 'even', 'seen', 'movie', 'bet', 'could', 'guess', 'what', 'would', 'happen.I', 'guessed', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Kyle', 'main', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'racked', 'guilt', 'ex-girlfriend', 'brother', 'who', 'amazingly', 'knew', 'Kyle', 'experience', 'child', 'one', 'ever', 'telling', 'who', 'also', 'immediately', 'liked', 'reason', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'protect', 'even', 'terrified', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'Somewhere', 'way', 'Michael', 'will', 'be', 'trapped', 'fairy', 'Caitlin', 'more', 'likely', 'Kyle', 'will', 'jump', 'nowhere', 'rescue', 'then', 'run', 'away', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'will', 'just', 'stay', 'there', 'look', 'moment', 'chasing', 'movie', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'will', 'have', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'time', 'catching', 'even', 'logically', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'easily', 'Finally', 'end', 'Kyle', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'trap', 'kill', 'then', 'Caitlin', 'kisses', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'Hey', 'maybe', 'Larry', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'Michael', 'will', 'even', 'do', 'brave', 'act', 'just', 'add', 'corniness.That', 'was', 'prediction', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'Can', 'guess', 'how', 'close', 'was', 'said', '95', '%', 'then', 'are', 'correct', 'When', 'finished', 'movie', 'were', 'plot', 'holes', 'galore', 'was', 'just', 'first', 'viewing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'Home', 'Alone', '4', 'talk', 'plot', 'holes', 'let', 'see', 'how', 'correct', 'predictions', 'Kyle', 'being', 'racked', 'guilt', 'part', 'debatable', ""n't"", 'show', 'guilty', 'long', 'why', 'else', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'saying', 'was', 'right', 'second', 'part', 'Michael', 'added', 'bonus', 'Caitlin', 'was', 'trapped', 'not', 'once', 'TWICE', 'Kyle', 'saved', 'times', ""n't"", 'terrific', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'standing', 'still', 'watch', 'run', 'away', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'immediately', 'did', 'eventually', 'happen', 'just', 'when', 'had', 'Kyle', 'trapped', 'movie', 'was', 'shown', 'fairy', 'moves', 'very', 'fast', 'yet', 'down', 'immensely', 'just', 'when', 'opportunity', 'catch', 'Kyle', 'others', 'pop', 'up', 'only', 'part', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'Kyle', 'Caitlin', 'kissing', 'did', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Oh', 'guess', 'what', 'Larry', 'was', 'killed.Now', 'plot', 'holes', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'shown', 'fairy', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'bit', 'light', 'matter', 'how', 'thin', 'weak', 'light', 'So', 'case', 'then', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'attack', 'hospital', 'staff', 'members', 'run', 'hallway', 'why', 'was', 'able', 'attack', 'cop', 'Kyle', 'end', 'even', 'had', 'light', 'why', 'able', 'stand', 'lightning', 'everything', 'almost', 'as', 'well', 'freaking', 'lighthouse', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'sucks']",N/A
744917,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00008LUNW,Clare Quilty,"[2, 4]","There's a lot to criticize about ""Darkness Falls"" but, in an effort to head straight to the positive, I'll say this: At least it's not very long.From its opening frames to the end of its closing credits, ""Darkness Falls"" clocks in at a lean 75 minutes. So, though viewers may be bored by the movie's predictability and dumbfounded by its lack of logic and character development, at least the filmmakers had the good sense to wrap the whole thing up in well under an hour and a half.The story: Twelve years after the murder of his mother, Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley) returns to his hometown of Darkness Falls to confront an evil spirit that's been plaguing the village for a century and a half. One could argue that any town with a name like ""Darkness Falls"" deserves all the evil spirits it attracts, but that's probably overthinking the issue.The spirit in question here is actually a local legend called the Tooth Fairy. This is not the same Tooth Fairy that caused all those problems in Anthony Hopkins' ""Red Dragon,"" which came out just three months ago. No, this is an entirely different (and far less interesting) Tooth Fairy - a ghost who can attack and kill anyone as long as they're in the dark. Since most of the movie's barely sketched characters spend a considerable amount of time wandering around in the dark (both literally and figuratively) the evil spirit has its work cut out for her.Faced with the problem of depicting a villain that can't be shown (after all, the Fairy can only attack in the dark ), the director compensates by giving her some of the most vivid and hilarious sound effects in the history of Dolby Digital. When The Tooth Fairy is about to strike she can be heard, in the dark, making noises, waiting for someone to drop and break his flashlight. Sometimes it sounds like she's gargling; sometimes it sounds like she's snoring; sometimes it sounds like she's hawking a supernatural loogie.The flick doesn't waste time with mundane details like character-developement.  People die and we hardly even understand who they are or what purpose they're supposed to serve within the plot.  And the Ghost plays pretty fast & loose with its own rules -- sometimes, it looked a lot like The Tooth Fairy was attacking people who were standing in relatively well-lit areas.But criticizing a horror movie these days is kind of beside the point (with the notable exclusion of ""The Ring"") because most horror movies these days aren't really meant to be reviewed, they're simply meant to be screamed at by rambunctious audiences of teens and pre-teens on a Saturday night until another low-budget, PG-13 horror movie comes out.

744919,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00008LUNW,Cubist,"[4, 5]","Recent films, such as The Ring and Wendigo, steeped heavily in vivid folklore, are heralding a new wave in the horror genre. If the '90s were typified by Irony Age films like Scream, then the new millennium identity plays it closer to the vest: straightforward approaches to human behaviour. Sarcastic banter between characters has been replaced with more realistic responses to the situation at hand.A recent entry into this sub-genre is Darkness Falls (2003).I found Emma Caulfield's Caitlin to be the complete antithesis to Anya, the perky vengeance demon she played on T.V.'s Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Caitlin is dressed down in plain, earth tone garb and mousy brown hair (much in the same fashion of Winona Ryder's character in Lost Souls). Caulfield does a good job in portraying a caring, maternal figure that is intensely protective of her little brother. She conveys an internal strength but also a vulnerability that results in a very sympathetic performance.Chaney Kley's portrayal of the soft-spoken, yet intense Kyle is a refreshing change-he plays a reluctant hero haunted by the past and forced to become more proactive if he is to come to terms with his fears.Avoiding the annoying child actor factor, the spot on casting of Lee Cormie is a welcome relief from the Haley Joel Osment school of cutesy acting. He has big, expressive eyes that suggest a tortured soul and his pained expressions create a genuine compassion for his character.Like Pitch Black, Darkness Falls uses the dark to suggest more by showing very little. For most of the movie the Tooth Fairy is only seen in fleeting glimpses as she uses the shadows to prey on unsuspecting victims. This is only further proof that a horror film does not need a lot of excessive gore to scare its audience. The timeless technique of playing with the audience's imagination is a much more effective way of creating suspense and terror.The DVD features two audio commentaries. First up is the filmmaker's commentary with director Jonathan Liebesman, producers William Sherak and Jason Shuman and co-screenwriter, James Vanderbilt. This is a more light-hearted audio track as the guys joke between each other and exchange anecdotes about the filming and touch on other films that influenced them. On the downside, both Liebesman and Vanderbilt talk about cut scenes that would have fleshed out some of the characters' backstories but none of them are included in the deleted scenes section!The second commentary is with the film's two other screenwriters, John Fasano and Joe Harris. The latter scribe wrote the original short film and then turned it into a feature-length screenplay. Fasano then re-wrote the screenplay which was, in turn, re-written by Vanderbilt. The two screenwriters track is much more focused as they talk at length about the early drafts: the original setting of the film was Long Island because that was the home of both men.There are seven deleted scenes and alternate takes that are all quite short in length and revolve around a sun necklace that Caitlin gave Kyle when they were kids. It's a shame that this subplot was removed from the film and no commentary is provided to explain why this footage was cut.Two featurettes are also included on the disc. ""The Legend of Matilda Dixon"" provides background on the actual legend of the Tooth Fairy. The story originates from an incident that occurred in the fishing town of Port Fairy, Australia in the 1800s. The ""locals"" that are interviewed in this featurette come across as well-rehearsed actors which calls into question the authenticity of this material.""The Making of Darkness Falls"" is a standard electronic press kit material as everyone speaks highly and enthusiastically about the project. This is Liebesman's first feature film and the producers picked him because he wanted to make ""a classy horror film"" in the tradition of Alien.Finally, three scenes from the movie are compared to their storyboards in a split screen effect so that both can be viewed simultaneously.Darkness Falls is a straightforward horror film that uses traditional scare tactics in a refreshingly effective way. It is a must-see for fans of Buffy's Emma Caulfield for her strong performance that is an exciting change from her T.V. persona. She has successfully made the difficult transition from T.V. to movies with this entertaining genre film.",3,"Actually, a pretty good movie...",1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,4377,"['Recent', 'films', 'such', 'Ring', 'Wendigo', 'steeped', 'heavily', 'vivid', 'folklore', 'are', 'heralding', 'new', 'wave', 'horror', 'genre', ""'90s"", 'were', 'typified', 'Irony', 'Age', 'films', 'Scream', 'then', 'new', 'millennium', 'identity', 'closer', 'vest', 'straightforward', 'human', 'behaviour', 'Sarcastic', 'banter', 'characters', 'been', 'replaced', 'more', 'realistic', 'responses', 'situation', 'hand.A', 'recent', 'entry', 'sub-genre', 'Darkness', 'Falls', '2003', '.I', 'found', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'Caitlin', 'be', 'complete', 'antithesis', 'Anya', 'perky', 'vengeance', 'demon', 'played', 'T.V', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Caitlin', 'dressed', 'down', 'plain', 'earth', 'tone', 'garb', 'mousy', 'brown', 'hair', 'much', 'same', 'fashion', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'character', 'Lost', 'Souls', 'Caulfield', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'caring', 'maternal', 'figure', 'intensely', 'protective', 'little', 'brother', 'conveys', 'internal', 'strength', 'also', 'vulnerability', 'results', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'performance.Chaney', 'Kley', 'portrayal', 'soft-spoken', 'yet', 'intense', 'Kyle', 'refreshing', 'change-he', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'haunted', 'past', 'forced', 'become', 'more', 'proactive', 'come', 'terms', 'fears.Avoiding', 'annoying', 'child', 'actor', 'factor', 'spot', 'casting', 'Lee', 'Cormie', 'welcome', 'relief', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'school', 'cutesy', 'acting', 'big', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'suggest', 'tortured', 'soul', 'pained', 'expressions', 'create', 'genuine', 'compassion', 'character.Like', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'dark', 'suggest', 'more', 'showing', 'very', 'little', 'most', 'movie', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'only', 'seen', 'fleeting', 'glimpses', 'shadows', 'prey', 'unsuspecting', 'victims', 'only', 'further', 'proof', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'need', 'lot', 'excessive', 'gore', 'scare', 'audience', 'timeless', 'technique', 'playing', 'audience', 'imagination', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'way', 'creating', 'suspense', 'terror.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'First', 'up', 'filmmaker', 'commentary', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Liebesman', 'producers', 'William', 'Sherak', 'Jason', 'Shuman', 'co-screenwriter', 'James', 'Vanderbilt', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'audio', 'track', 'guys', 'joke', 'other', 'exchange', 'anecdotes', 'filming', 'touch', 'other', 'films', 'influenced', 'downside', 'Liebesman', 'Vanderbilt', 'talk', 'cut', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'backstories', 'none', 'are', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'section', 'second', 'commentary', 'film', 'two', 'other', 'screenwriters', 'John', 'Fasano', 'Joe', 'Harris', 'latter', 'scribe', 'wrote', 'original', 'short', 'film', 'then', 'turned', 'feature-length', 'screenplay', 'Fasano', 'then', 're-wrote', 'screenplay', 'was', 'turn', 're-written', 'Vanderbilt', 'two', 'screenwriters', 'track', 'much', 'more', 'focused', 'talk', 'length', 'early', 'drafts', 'original', 'setting', 'film', 'was', 'Long', 'Island', 'was', 'home', 'are', 'seven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'are', 'quite', 'short', 'length', 'revolve', 'sun', 'necklace', 'Caitlin', 'gave', 'Kyle', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'shame', 'subplot', 'was', 'removed', 'film', 'commentary', 'provided', 'explain', 'why', 'footage', 'was', 'cut.Two', 'featurettes', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'disc', 'Legend', 'Matilda', 'Dixon', 'background', 'actual', 'legend', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'story', 'incident', 'occurred', 'fishing', 'town', 'Port', 'Fairy', 'Australia', '1800s', 'locals', 'are', 'interviewed', 'featurette', 'come', 'well-rehearsed', 'actors', 'question', 'authenticity', 'material', 'Making', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'standard', 'electronic', 'press', 'kit', 'material', 'everyone', 'highly', 'enthusiastically', 'project', 'Liebesman', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'producers', 'picked', 'wanted', 'make', 'classy', 'horror', 'film', 'tradition', 'Alien.Finally', 'three', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'compared', 'storyboards', 'split', 'screen', 'effect', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'simultaneously.Darkness', 'Falls', 'straightforward', 'horror', 'film', 'traditional', 'scare', 'tactics', 'refreshingly', 'effective', 'way', 'must-see', 'fans', 'Buffy', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'strong', 'performance', 'exciting', 'change', 'T.V', 'persona', 'successfully', 'made', 'difficult', 'transition', 'T.V', 'movies', 'entertaining', 'genre', 'film']",N/A

Jason X was [not good] and Halloween Resurection (though it is still my favorite franchise) was lacking that special something.  Darkness Falls is a beacon of light for horror fans such as myself who crave something new and interesting.  The story takes place in the town of Darkness Falls, where 100 years ago, an old woman would give children cakes and treats in exchange for their baby teeth.  Thus earning her the name Tooth Fairy.  After a hideous fire that burns her face and body, she becomes a recluse who wears a porcelain mask to hide her deformity.  She gives the children gold coins instead of treats.  When two children don't come home after going to see her, the town lynches her and hangs her.  She puts a curse on the town that she will have revenge on their descendents, killing any who see her face while she continues to exchange gold coins for the last of each childs baby teeth.  We flash forward to the semi present and find Kyle walsh losing the last of his baby teeth, and waking up to the Tooth Fairy.  He manages to escape her but his mother is killed and he is blamed.  He spends the next 12 years staying out of the light.  Now the present.  Kyle's old flame Caitlyn has a younger brother Michael who has just lost his last baby tooth and is experiencing similar night terrors.  Caitlyn, at the end of her rope calls Kyle and he must go back to his hometown to save the boy and everyone else who gets in the path of the Tooth Fairy before it is too late.  This movie has great suspense and some great spine tingling moments.

744921,A169I83JL8QJGN,B00008LUNW,Daniel A Moir,"[15, 23]","Whenever I see a horror movie get the PG-13 rating I generally rush out to see it. It&#65533;s rare that a horror film can get away with scaring an audience at anything less than an R rating.Maybe its because I've grown up on horror films, but I'm getting really finicky about scary movies. There's a certain level of quality that I expect and I am constantly let down. I suppose that a movie where the villain is the tooth fairy should be obviously low quality, but I had hoped that they could put a new and scary twist on the classic legend that might actually be good. I assumed wrong.I'll give credit to its special effects, but the poor plot, bad acting, and cheesy ""we're going to die"" dialogue played into far too many horror stereotypes for this film to be even remotely enjoyable for me.I'm sick of the ""Boo!"" type scares. I want a film with a deeply psychological story, and an aroma of mystery. Had I written this story I would have played on the lead characters psychological condition. I would have left it up in the air whether or not he was the killer, or if the tooth fairy had indeed gone bad. It would have been more interesting.The ghost showed up way too often, and the kills were uninteresting and boring. There was nothing intense or scary about this film at all. Then again, I'm not sure if the concept was any good to begin with.

744922,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00008LUNW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 6]","Any film promising me an evil tooth fairy is one I just have to see.  Darkness Falls is not a perfect film, but it earns five stars from this reviewer for a number of reasons.  Directors are oftentimes little more than names to me, some of which I know and some of which I do not, but Jonathan Liebesman is a refreshingly humble, exuberant, and talented young director with an appreciation of old-school, atmospheric horror.  I tend to question the power of PG-13 horror movies, but Darkness Falls delivers.  This is exactly the type of film with which to begin one's experience with the genre.  With no nudity, no real gore, and hardly any profanity, it is a film that parents should have little to objection to their children watching (as long as those children no longer believe in the Tooth Fairy, that is).  This is horror that inspires exhilaration without any nightmarish after-effects.The opening of the movie is quite good.  First, we are told of the legend of Matilda Dixon, a kindly lady of the early nineteenth century who gave children coins for their lost teeth, thereby acquiring her nickname as the tooth fairy.  After being burned horribly in a fire, Matilda would only appear at night, wearing a porcelain mask; the town's growing suspicions of this poor woman were eventually inflamed when two kids went missing; a lynch mob took Matilda from her home, exposed her badly burned face for all to see, and hanged her just before the missing boys turned up safe and sound elsewhere.  Matilda cursed the town, and the story goes that she comes seeking revenge on the children there when they lose their last baby teeth.  Don't peek, parents laughingly warn their children, or else the tooth fairy will kill you  One boy did peek, learning that the legends were somehow actually true, and the dramatization of that night's terrible events is capable of generating more than a few creeps within the soul of the viewer.  The boy survived that night, but his life was thrown into chaos, costing him his mother, girlfriend, home, and, to some degree, his sanity.  Twelve years later, he lives in a world of constant light, knowing that Matilda can only harm him in darkness.  When his little girlfriend of old, Caitlyn, calls him out of the blue seeking his help for her little brother, a child suffering from night terrors of the worst kind, he reluctantly comes back home.  His desperate effort to help young Michael leads to an inevitable final confrontation between himself and the demon-haunted tooth fairy, and the town of Darkness Falls will never be the same.This is not a high-budget film, but the overall look and feel of it is impressive.  In his first professional directing job, Liebesman snags some major talent, much of it coming from a new generation of professionals.  In the interviews included in the Making Of featurette, Liebesman gives those around him what is perhaps too much credit for making this first film of his as successful as it is.  Undoubtedly, though he was fortunate indeed to have Stan Winston design his vengeful tooth fairy.  I think the creature works very well, both before and after its porcelain mask is removed, and the camera work makes her all the more interesting and disturbing.  Much of the action consists of fast-paced movements and visual chaos, leading one to peer deeply into the darkness looking for her; such concentration on the part of the viewer opens up the door for some quick little scares and Boo tactics.  The entire cast is superb, particularly Chaney Kley and  the lovely Emma Caulfield, but in many ways the very talented child actor Lee Cormie steals the show and does more than anyone else to make this fanciful tale quite believable.The extras included on the DVD make the movie a much richer experience.  The Making Of featurette really increased my appreciation for what I had seen, and the set of deleted scenes has an important contribution to make.  Whereas most movie's deleted scenes clearly deserve to have been cut, most of the deleted scenes here add so much more depth to different parts of the story that I question why they were ever deleted in the first place.  You get two distinct commentaries of the film, your choice of widescreen or full screen display, and a most interesting documentary about the real life of Matilda Dixon, the tooth fairy of Port Fairy, Australia, upon whose legend this movie was conceived.  The whole package is most impressive, and I believe the movie deserves more attention than it has received.",5,Stay in the light during this underappreciated horror film,1059177600,"07 26, 2003",2003,4519,"['film', 'promising', 'evil', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'one', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'reviewer', 'number', 'reasons', 'Directors', 'are', 'oftentimes', 'little', 'more', 'names', 'know', 'do', 'not', 'Jonathan', 'Liebesman', 'refreshingly', 'humble', 'exuberant', 'talented', 'young', 'director', 'appreciation', 'old-school', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'tend', 'question', 'power', 'PG-13', 'horror', 'movies', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'delivers', 'exactly', 'type', 'film', 'begin', 'one', 'experience', 'genre', 'nudity', 'real', 'gore', 'hardly', 'profanity', 'film', 'parents', 'should', 'have', 'little', 'objection', 'children', 'watching', 'as', 'long', 'children', 'no', 'longer', 'believe', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'horror', 'exhilaration', 'nightmarish', 'after-effects.The', 'opening', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'First', 'are', 'told', 'legend', 'Matilda', 'Dixon', 'kindly', 'lady', 'early', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'who', 'gave', 'children', 'coins', 'lost', 'teeth', 'thereby', 'acquiring', 'nickname', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'being', 'burned', 'horribly', 'fire', 'Matilda', 'would', 'only', 'appear', 'night', 'wearing', 'porcelain', 'mask', 'town', 'growing', 'suspicions', 'poor', 'woman', 'were', 'eventually', 'inflamed', 'when', 'two', 'kids', 'went', 'missing', 'lynch', 'mob', 'took', 'Matilda', 'home', 'exposed', 'badly', 'burned', 'face', 'see', 'hanged', 'just', 'missing', 'boys', 'turned', 'up', 'safe', 'sound', 'elsewhere', 'Matilda', 'cursed', 'town', 'story', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'children', 'there', 'when', 'lose', 'last', 'baby', 'teeth', 'Do', ""n't"", 'peek', 'parents', 'laughingly', 'warn', 'children', 'else', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'will', 'kill', 'One', 'boy', 'did', 'peek', 'learning', 'legends', 'were', 'somehow', 'actually', 'true', 'dramatization', 'night', 'terrible', 'events', 'capable', 'generating', 'more', 'few', 'creeps', 'soul', 'viewer', 'boy', 'survived', 'night', 'life', 'was', 'thrown', 'chaos', 'costing', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'home', 'degree', 'sanity', 'Twelve', 'years', 'later', 'world', 'constant', 'light', 'knowing', 'Matilda', 'can', 'only', 'harm', 'darkness', 'When', 'little', 'girlfriend', 'old', 'Caitlyn', 'blue', 'seeking', 'help', 'little', 'brother', 'child', 'suffering', 'night', 'terrors', 'worst', 'kind', 'reluctantly', 'back', 'home', 'desperate', 'effort', 'help', 'young', 'Michael', 'inevitable', 'final', 'confrontation', 'demon-haunted', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'town', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same.This', 'not', 'high-budget', 'film', 'overall', 'look', 'feel', 'impressive', 'first', 'professional', 'directing', 'job', 'Liebesman', 'major', 'talent', 'much', 'coming', 'new', 'generation', 'professionals', 'interviews', 'included', 'Making', 'featurette', 'Liebesman', 'what', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'making', 'first', 'film', 'as', 'successful', 'Undoubtedly', 'was', 'fortunate', 'indeed', 'have', 'Stan', 'Winston', 'design', 'vengeful', 'fairy', 'think', 'creature', 'very', 'well', 'porcelain', 'mask', 'removed', 'camera', 'work', 'more', 'interesting', 'disturbing', 'Much', 'action', 'fast-paced', 'movements', 'visual', 'chaos', 'leading', 'one', 'peer', 'deeply', 'darkness', 'looking', 'such', 'concentration', 'part', 'viewer', 'up', 'door', 'quick', 'little', 'scares', 'Boo', 'tactics', 'entire', 'cast', 'superb', 'particularly', 'Chaney', 'Kley', 'lovely', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'many', 'ways', 'very', 'talented', 'child', 'actor', 'Lee', 'Cormie', 'show', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'make', 'fanciful', 'tale', 'quite', 'believable.The', 'extras', 'included', 'DVD', 'make', 'movie', 'much', 'richer', 'experience', 'Making', 'featurette', 'really', 'increased', 'appreciation', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'set', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'important', 'contribution', 'make', 'Whereas', 'most', 'movie', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'clearly', 'deserve', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'most', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'here', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'different', 'parts', 'story', 'question', 'why', 'were', 'ever', 'deleted', 'first', 'place', 'get', 'two', 'distinct', 'commentaries', 'film', 'choice', 'widescreen', 'full', 'screen', 'display', 'most', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'real', 'life', 'Matilda', 'Dixon', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'Port', 'Fairy', 'Australia', 'legend', 'movie', 'was', 'conceived', 'whole', 'package', 'most', 'impressive', 'believe', 'movie', 'more', 'attention', 'received']",N/A

Although a great many people die in this film, you don't actually see it happen.  In some cases, you simply catch a glimpse of the aftermath.  They were trying desperately not to get an R rating.I like gore as much as anyone but I can also handle horror that just hints or suggests death without being blatant about it.  This was, after all, more of a ghost story than anything else (as this vicious avenging tooth fairy was everywhere, locked doors could not keep her out).  I also appreciated that most of the film had to take place at night and for once, we have a cinematographer who could keep an element of darkness intact yet still let us see things creeping about.  More than anything, I loved the camera work in this film.  The way scenes were cropped was brilliant.  I also loved the scoring (sound was carefully used to make up for the lack of graphic depictions).  This is definitely a film geared towards an audience more accepting of old-school horror than what is expected from slasher or torture films.  If you are looking for something beyond jump scares and brooding menace, than this film is not going to satisfy you, look elsewhere.  For me, I loved the stealth and unrelenting aspect of the story, gore was not required.I've watched this film several times (even bought a replacement copy), and I plan to watch it many times more.  It's a favorite of mine.",5,"""Stay in the light.""",1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,1496,"['Darkness', 'Falls', 'very', 'basic', 'horror', 'movie', 'reminiscent', 'way', 'horror', 'was', 'filmed', 'gore', 'started', 'flow', 'great', 'many', 'people', 'die', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'happen', 'cases', 'simply', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'aftermath', 'were', 'trying', 'desperately', 'not', 'get', 'R', 'rating.I', 'gore', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'can', 'also', 'handle', 'horror', 'just', 'hints', 'death', 'being', 'blatant', 'was', 'more', 'ghost', 'story', 'anything', 'else', 'vicious', 'avenging', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'was', 'everywhere', 'locked', 'doors', 'could', 'not', 'keep', 'out', 'also', 'appreciated', 'most', 'film', 'had', 'take', 'place', 'night', 'once', 'have', 'cinematographer', 'who', 'could', 'keep', 'element', 'darkness', 'intact', 'yet', 'still', 'let', 'see', 'things', 'creeping', 'about', 'More', 'anything', 'loved', 'camera', 'work', 'film', 'way', 'scenes', 'were', 'cropped', 'was', 'brilliant', 'also', 'loved', 'scoring', 'sound', 'was', 'carefully', 'used', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'definitely', 'film', 'geared', 'audience', 'more', 'accepting', 'old-school', 'horror', 'what', 'expected', 'slasher', 'torture', 'films', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'jump', 'scares', 'brooding', 'menace', 'film', 'not', 'going', 'satisfy', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'loved', 'stealth', 'unrelenting', 'aspect', 'story', 'gore', 'was', 'not', 'required.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'even', 'bought', 'replacement', 'copy', 'plan', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'more', 'favorite', 'mine']",N/A

Unfortunately for viewers the filmmakers didn't execute it right, I guess we have to take what we get. With that being said 2 exec. Producers, 3 writers, 4 producers, & 1 director later we have this attempt at a mainstream film. Not to say it doesn't have it's moments. I was very pleased with the beginning when the kid peeks and sees her eye that was great. Also to see the mother killed was a surprise, usually in these films the parents check it out, nothing there and the kid looks stupid. Ah but not here, she is executed. Another nice moment is when the Tooth Fairy glides threw the trees right before she kills the dumb drunk guy in the woods who was picking a fight with Kyle.Speaking of Kyle, Chaney Kley {who sounds like JASON LEE} gives an alright performance in a roll that didn't give him to much to do. The same can not be said for Emma Caulfield who to me didn't make the performance believable. Everyone else in the film does what they can with the script, some of the side performances are good. It's also cool to see the tooth fairy snatch people out of no where.  Like when they are jumping down the stairs, and she grabs the nurse. One thing I didn't get is why Kyle would come back to see the kid for Caitlin, the film tries to say they are romantically linked {Kyle talking to Larry in the car} but that never happens.As far as the creature goes Stan Winston Studio did an excellent job with the tooth fairy. The long black cloak and the white mask were great. As far as everything else goes, just average.

Reading the synopsis of Darkness Falls made me want to rent it: this movie about a young man being haunted sounded unique and original, and most importantly, scary. However, after watching it, I felt I was misled.One of the reasons this movie is not scary and fails is lack of background information.  The beginning of the movie kind of just ""narrates"" briefly why this town is supposed to be cursed by this woman. Background as to why this woman's spirit is so determined to haunt invididuals of this town would have been helpful (I know, I read the cover, but still..). Instead, she just appears after a youth loses his tooth and the proceeds to chase characters around aimlessly moaning incoherantly, and the audience is left with the question ""So, why exactly is the Wicked Witch of the East chasing these people around?""Action seems to be the movie's main focus, as opposed to figuring out a way to scare people. The movie pretty much turns into ""action movie meets The Blair Witch Project"". The story's protagonist knows exactly what to do (after, of course, 20 years of being tortured by this spirit you wonder why he didn't do something sooner) and of course needs to race here and there in his car to try to save the young boy from meeting his end in the darkness. He has to get to the hospital, and of course he is the ""freak"" and everyone thinks he's crazy for believing in this demon/ghost/whatever that chases and kills individuals. He eventually ends up looking like Bruce Willis in Die Hard as he goes in for the battle with the demon, jumping over glass, climbing walls, saying one-liners, etc.Scary movies are the most difficult movies to produce effectively, and this movie proves this point. However, the frustrating thing is that this movie doesn't even make a good attempt at being scary, yet alone explaining why scenes are taking place.Enough with the moaning of the spirit, enough with the ""don't stay in the dark"" references. The movie is just trying to push something that is ineffective from the get go. If you are a big skeptic of horror movies, then you will probably find this movie laughable.

Surely it would be a better idea to kill the people who wrongfully executed her.More problems I have with this movie begin with the fact that almost every actor is miscast in regards to the age of the character. It's very off-putting. None of the characters use the slightest bit of common-sense or make even the slightest decision (until the last second of course, it makes it more 'suspenseful') and the dialogue is below adequate.The 'dark' look to the film feels pretty cliched and it's mostly just uninspired photography in the most generic of sets. Hardly anything unique. All this movie represents is a recycling of tired cliches and stereotypes and a by-the-numbers, unexciting story.

Director Jonathan Liebesman did a fine job of putting together this film.  The actors, Chaney Kley and Emma Caulfield, did a great job acting out their parts in this film and accomplished in making them believeable.  The Tooth Fairy's story and past was well described in the beginning of the film and her appearences were something to look forward to throughout the entire film.The DVD is also very well done.  The picture is extremely clear and fully detailed.  The sound is nice and pleasing to the ear.  The special features are also good.  They include: filmmakers commentaries, The Legend of Matilda Dixon, The Making of Darkness Falls, deleted scenes, storyboard comparisons, widescreen and fullscreen presentations, and more.  Over this DVD is well done and well thought out.  This film is rated PG-13 for terror and horror images, and brief language.  It is approximately 86 minutes long.(REVIEW CONTAINS SOME MINOR SPOILERS:SCROLL DOWN FOR REVIEW)As a young boy, Kyle puts his last tooth under his pillow and is told by his friend not to peek at the tooth fairy.  Awaking from a nightmare, he jumps up and sees shadows moving across the wall.  When he pulls the covers down he sees a face covered with a porcelin mask and he runs into the bathroom.  His mother then comes out of her bedroom to see what the noise is about.  As she ventures into her sons room when the son is begging her not to, she sees nothing wrong.  Then sees is attacked by the figure and the boy runs and jumps into the tub to hide.  That morning the police come and take Kyle away.Now over twelve years later, Kyle has left the town that never believed him.  He also left behind the one person who truly believed him, his childhood girlfriend Caitlin.  With evil emerging in Darkness Falls again, Kyle must return to battle the creature that ruined his childhood so many years ago.This film is surely worth a rental, but you must decide if you want to buy or not because not everyone will enjoy this film.Hollywood",5,Evil is Back With a Vengeance,1052006400,"05 4, 2003",2003,2149,"['Shunned', 'many', 'critics', 'worthless', 'audiences', 'found', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'be', 'entertaining', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'engrossing', 'well', 'done', 'Director', 'Jonathan', 'Liebesman', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'putting', 'together', 'film', 'actors', 'Chaney', 'Kley', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'acting', 'out', 'parts', 'film', 'accomplished', 'making', 'believeable', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'story', 'past', 'was', 'well', 'described', 'beginning', 'film', 'appearences', 'were', 'something', 'look', 'forward', 'entire', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'picture', 'extremely', 'clear', 'fully', 'detailed', 'sound', 'nice', 'pleasing', 'ear', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'include', 'filmmakers', 'commentaries', 'Legend', 'Matilda', 'Dixon', 'Making', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'storyboard', 'comparisons', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen', 'presentations', 'more', 'DVD', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'terror', 'horror', 'images', 'brief', 'language', 'approximately', '86', 'minutes', 'long', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SOME', 'MINOR', 'SPOILERS', 'SCROLL', 'DOWN', 'FOR', 'REVIEW', 'young', 'boy', 'Kyle', 'last', 'tooth', 'pillow', 'told', 'friend', 'not', 'peek', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'Awaking', 'nightmare', 'up', 'sees', 'shadows', 'moving', 'wall', 'When', 'covers', 'down', 'face', 'covered', 'porcelin', 'mask', 'bathroom', 'mother', 'then', 'bedroom', 'see', 'what', 'noise', 'about', 'ventures', 'sons', 'room', 'when', 'son', 'begging', 'not', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Then', 'attacked', 'figure', 'boy', 'runs', 'jumps', 'tub', 'hide', 'morning', 'police', 'come', 'take', 'Kyle', 'away.Now', 'twelve', 'years', 'later', 'Kyle', 'left', 'town', 'never', 'believed', 'also', 'left', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'truly', 'believed', 'childhood', 'girlfriend', 'Caitlin', 'evil', 'emerging', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'again', 'Kyle', 'must', 'return', 'battle', 'creature', 'ruined', 'childhood', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago.This', 'film', 'surely', 'worth', 'rental', 'must', 'decide', 'want', 'buy', 'not', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film.Hollywood']",N/A

744953,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00008LUNW,Jeffrey Leach,"[1, 2]","A few minutes after I popped ""Darkness Falls"" into my DVD player, I sensed a strong resemblance to ""The Blair Witch Project."" Don't get me wrong: there are plenty of differences between the two movies. ""The Blair Witch Project"" tries to generate scares psychologically, by making the viewer fill in the terrible blanks about what those three filmmakers hear stalking through the woods. ""Darkness Falls"" goes straight for the jugular by actually showing you the creature responsible for so much mayhem during the course of the film. I guess the similarity struck me as I watched the opening sequence regarding the history of Matilda Dixon, a sequence resembling the back story about the Blair Witch. The fact that a few extras on the disc play up the legend of Matilda Dixon by attempting to link her with real events also reminded me of ""The Blair Witch Project.""Well, ""Darkness Falls"" easily stands on its own two feet. The opening scenes reveal a bit of background on good old Matilda Dixon, stating that about 150 years ago she used to play tooth fairy to the little tots in the village of Darkness Falls. Then tragedy struck, as two kids disappeared and the townspeople blamed this suspicious incident on Dixon. The result was the execution and disfigurement of Matilda Dixon. Dixon cursed the town with her final breath, declaring that the children of Darkness Falls would always face her eternal wrath from beyond the grave. This curse is as follows: a child who loses his or her last tooth and peeks at Matilda when she arrives to collect the tooth faces a world of hurt. A kid who doesn't attempt to catch a peek of Dixon will come through just fine, but several children do look and consequently suffer a terrible experience. One of these children is Kyle Walsh, who actually had the gall to survive an attack by this malevolent tooth fairy. The lengthy scenes of Kyle's encounter with Matilda Dixon really deliver some chills. Regrettably, the rest of the film steps away from this promising opening.Kyle Walsh's Mom died the night he saw Matilda Dixon, so he never got to take Caitlin Greene (also known as Cat) to the school dance. In fact, young Kyle ended up floating through foster care for ten or so years before landing in Las Vegas in the present day. Cat never forgot about her young love, and when her little brother undergoes an unpleasant occurrence with Matilda Dixon, she tracks down Kyle in the hopes that he will return to town and help the latest victim. Kyle, as we quickly notice in a few shots of his apartment, never got over his nightmarish encounter: he pops anti-psychotic pills like candy and always carries a big bag of flashlights around with him just in case Dixon rears her mug. Kyle's enthusiasm about returning to Darkness Falls is nonexistent. He does it, though, and reunites with Cat and a few other childhood acquaintances. Most of the locals are definitely not happy about Kyle's reappearance because they believe he killed his Mom, especially the town cops who quickly blame a few of Matilda's latest nighttime excursions on Walsh. The truth comes out soon enough as the town undergoes a full frontal assault by Dixon. We even get to see her face in the epic confrontation in a lighthouse at the end of the movie.Several problems plague ""Darkness Falls."" I kept wondering what happened to Caitlin's parents. Her little brother is suffering psychotic episodes in a hospital and the parents are nowhere to be found? Why? Perhaps it's due to budgetary restrictions that hindered hiring two more actors to play concerned parents. Another problem with the film is its short running time. ""Darkness Falls"" clocks in at roughly eighty-five minutes, with the opening sequence on Matilda Dixon eating into that total along with closing credits that run for another eleven. This isn't a movie; it's a television special. A lack of gruesome scenes also proved problematic for me. Granted, this movie does have a PG-13 rating, but I still would have liked a few bloody encounters with the evil tooth fairy.I do believe ""Darkness Falls"" delivers a few chilling and frightening scenes along with several chuckles. You might jump a few times during the Kyle Walsh/Matilda Dixon sequence at the beginning of the movie, and the part where Dixon runs rampant through the local police station works quite well too. I roared with laughter when Kyle rocketed through the windshield of a car after it plowed into a tree. Boy, how could a guy get right up after that catastrophic collision? Don't mess with Kyle Walsh, folks! He's a bad dude! Overall, ""Darkness Falls"" isn't the best horror movie I have ever seen, but it is definitely worth a rental.The Special Edition DVD contains a constellation of extras, including two commentary tracks, one with the director and one with two of the writers. There are also deleted scenes, storyboards, full and widescreen options, a making of documentary, and a ""Legend of Matilda Dixon"" film. That's an excellent deal if you decide to watch this movie on DVD. I am willing to bet that a sequel is already in the works, and if so, I liked ""Darkness Falls"" just enough to watch any subsequent installments.",4,A Few Effective Frights,1063756800,"09 17,

744954,A1HO5HKD2MSIQK,B00008LUNW,"Jeff W. ""Jeff W.""","[1, 3]","Yawn, another ""paint by numbers"" horror film.  This very weak entry into the horror genre follows the exact same formula as the Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street films.  That is, there's an unstoppable person who kills at night.  In this case, it happens to be a witch/tooth fairy.  The story follows the usual predictable path that these films tend to do.  An unappealing group of individuals must band together to try to stay alive while being stalked by a supernatural creature.  In all fairness, the tooth fairy herself is done well.  She's scary looking and she moves very quickly.  However, every single scare is so obvious and trite.  In fact, this film stoops to the level of cheap scares by having a black cat jump out (Friday the 13th Part II anyone?)!  This is the kind of film where one character will say, ""There's something in that room"" and another character will go look, will find nothing, will turn around and say, ""There's nothing here"" and then (fill in predictable conclusion).  This is the kind of film where the solution is so obvious!  In this film we're told that the town is cursed by the tooth fairy and she'll come out to get you when you lose your final tooth.  Here's an idea, MOVE! LEAVE THE TOWN!  Why on earth would you stay there knowing that you'll be killed?  The main character in the film moved when he was a child.  He only comes back to the town because the tooth fairy is terrorizing a new little kid.  Why wouldn't the main character's very first act be to take the little kid out of the town?  Also, the tooth fairy will only get you if it's dark.  Here's an idea, if the power goes out (as it does in the film), light some candles!!!  There's no excuse for these characters to ever be in jeapordy because one can always produce light.  This is also the type of film where you know how it's going to end 5 minutes into it.

It's a good idea to have an evil tooth fairy and she id scary. When she attacks someone though it's the same over and over again. She just swoops down and grabs them. We have to use our imagination to what she's doing to them through the whole movie. The film would of been scarier if it had some surprises to it. Instead it's predictible where she's gonna show up and when she's gonna show up. You also hear ""stay in the laight, stay alive"" about 20 times in one movie. It's also silly how they can't put the kid in the cat scan like machine because it's dark in there. It's silly because you hear that evil moan she does when they're getting ready to put the kid inside. Ok she comes out when it's dark is one thing but putting her everywhere it's dark including a catscan machine is just silly. I hear they might do a sequel and i don't mind that because I think they can approve upon the originals flaws if they try. For one thing it's needs to be more violent without all the non-stop swooping and grabbing from the air. The only scary thing about this one is hearing the Tooth Fairy coming with that scary moan she does, haha.

744958,A1F6DHVFE1ZIXX,B00008LUNW,John,"[6, 15]","Seeing this movie is an experience that I will never forget.  Now that I said that, don't take it the wrong way.  This movie is only slightly better than mediocre, what makes it memorable is the condition under which I viewed it.  I had time to kill for several hours earlier this week, and decided to go to the movies.  This was the only thing worth watching at my local theater (that I hadn't already seen) so I saw the 4:40 showing.  To my surprise, there was NOT ONE PERSON THERE!  Maybe this is not such an odd thing, but it is amazing for me.  It was like having my own personal screening.  Watching a horror movie alone in a big dark theater is really something special.  But on to the review...The movie starts out with a short explanation of the Tooth Fairy, which you will find summarized in Amazon.com's review.  Then comes the obligatory opening scare that all horror movies contain.  In it, the main character is shown as a child.  He has just lost his last baby tooth, and in the town of Darkness Falls that spells trouble.  According to legend, anyone who peeks when the Tooth Fairy comes to take your last tooth is doomed, and poor Kyle peeks.  This results in a frighteningly well-done scene in which the Tooth Fairy attacks Kyle, then kills his mother.  The part in the bathroom is particularly brilliant.  The movie is very dark up until Kyle runs into the bathroom, but the bathroom is bright and almost entirely white.  Kyle jumps in the bathtub and hides behind the curtain, and the camera angles during this scene are fantastic.  They are reminicsent of the great Stanely Kubrick.  After this scene I decided that even if the rest of the movie was horrible, these 10 minutes or so were worth my five dollars.  If the director had used the same amount of attention to detail that he put into this scene, this movie would have been a classicFor better or worse, the movie is all downhill from there. There are some other highlights, such as the long scene in the police station near the end, but that's about it. Don't get me wrong, it is not horrible, but the quality definitely dips.  It is very clich&eacute;d to say the least.  The actors' performances are satisfactory, and for the most part the script is ok (for what it is), but the screenwriter needs to learn to write children's dialogue.  Whenever a child talks in the film, it is like an adults words coming out of their mouth, not believable at all as something a kid would say.  Also some might be disappointed with the BOO! type scares, but under the circumstances that I watched the movie, it worked very well.Overall this is a very mediocre movie.  It is not for hardcore horror fans at all, so steer clear if that is who you are.  For anyone else, if you are looking for an hour and a half of entertainment, then you have found the right movie. For anyone else this is probably a three star movie.  For me, this movie will always be remembered as a great experience, so four stars.",4,Stay in the light!,1043971200,"01 31, 2003",2003,2969,"['Seeing', 'movie', 'experience', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'Now', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'wrong', 'way', 'movie', 'only', 'slightly', 'better', 'mediocre', 'what', 'memorable', 'condition', 'viewed', 'had', 'time', 'kill', 'several', 'hours', 'earlier', 'week', 'decided', 'go', 'movies', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'worth', 'watching', 'local', 'theater', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'so', 'saw', '4:40', 'showing', 'surprise', 'was', 'NOT', 'ONE', 'PERSON', 'THERE', 'Maybe', 'not', 'such', 'odd', 'thing', 'amazing', 'was', 'having', 'own', 'personal', 'screening', 'Watching', 'horror', 'movie', 'alone', 'big', 'dark', 'theater', 'really', 'something', 'special', 'review', 'movie', 'out', 'short', 'explanation', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'will', 'find', 'summarized', 'Amazon.com', 'review', 'Then', 'obligatory', 'opening', 'scare', 'horror', 'movies', 'contain', 'main', 'character', 'shown', 'child', 'just', 'lost', 'last', 'baby', 'tooth', 'town', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'trouble', 'According', 'legend', 'anyone', 'who', 'when', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'take', 'last', 'tooth', 'doomed', 'poor', 'Kyle', 'peeks', 'results', 'frighteningly', 'well-done', 'scene', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'attacks', 'Kyle', 'then', 'mother', 'part', 'bathroom', 'particularly', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'very', 'dark', 'up', 'Kyle', 'bathroom', 'bathroom', 'bright', 'almost', 'entirely', 'white', 'Kyle', 'bathtub', 'hides', 'curtain', 'camera', 'scene', 'are', 'fantastic', 'are', 'reminicsent', 'great', 'Stanely', 'Kubrick', 'scene', 'decided', 'even', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'horrible', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'were', 'worth', 'five', 'dollars', 'director', 'had', 'used', 'same', 'amount', 'attention', 'detail', 'put', 'scene', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'classicFor', 'better', 'worse', 'movie', 'downhill', 'there', 'are', 'other', 'highlights', 'such', 'long', 'scene', 'police', 'station', 'end', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'horrible', 'quality', 'definitely', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'say', 'least', 'actors', 'performances', 'are', 'satisfactory', 'most', 'part', 'script', 'ok', 'what', 'screenwriter', 'learn', 'write', 'children', 'dialogue', 'Whenever', 'child', 'talks', 'film', 'adults', 'words', 'coming', 'mouth', 'not', 'believable', 'something', 'kid', 'would', 'say', 'Also', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'BOO', 'type', 'scares', 'circumstances', 'watched', 'movie', 'worked', 'very', 'well.Overall', 'very', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'not', 'hardcore', 'horror', 'fans', 'so', 'steer', 'clear', 'who', 'are', 'anyone', 'else', 'are', 'looking', 'hour', 'half', 'entertainment', 'then', 'have', 'found', 'right', 'movie', 'anyone', 'else', 'probably', 'three', 'star', 'movie', 'movie', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'great', 'experience', 'so', 'four', 'stars']",N/A

But nothing else ..., yet has to grab my high attention. And here, I am talking about Darkness Falls. I really wanted this movie to grab me by the hair and tug me into the darkness a la the ""Tooth Fairy"" villian here, but nothing did.The premise was great. The town of Darkness Falls has a dark legend. The woman who gave children a gold coin in exchange for their baby teeth. When she is accused of murdering 2 children, they hang the woman. In revenge, she spends her afterlife visiting those who lose their last baby teeth. Those who take a look while she's visiting, they die. Actually, anyone who spies her, they die. Awesome awesome premise. Was it handled ""awesome awesome?"" Nah. If I were 14 again, and watching this, I may have been scared.I was kind of relying on the performances to bring this up. Didn't happen. Not even with Emma Caulfield. How can she act so superbly on Buffy and act half wittedly here? The dialogue. Darkness Falls had some of the shortest and redundant dialogue. Our three main characters had minimal depth while others were just placed in to be killed. Which we never saw. Just a fly away effect.Even with this array of negatives I'm throwing in this review, there were some positives. The opening montage of Matilda's past was neat. And the opening scene in which we learn the main character's past with Matilda or the Tooth Fairy was a suspense-filled and nifty shot sequence. After that, everything went downhill. The finale gave a little bit of a resurgance, but not much. And the extremely long credits were interesting. What was that song playing at the beginning?The DVD is a pretty good one. Audio and video are good. There are two commentaries if you're interested. Seven deleted scenes are included. The only one worth watching is the Hallway of Lights. Should have kept that one in the movie. Also included are 2 featurettes and the interesting storyboard comparisons. Not a theatrical trailer, though. Perhaps it is being saved for a director's cut? I really want a director's cut. See, I'm still hoping for this to be a good movie.In the end, Darkness Falls shows nothing new, and gives nothing more to the basic horror movie.

The first part that told the story about the tooth fairy was pretty good but then what could have been a pretty scary movie just turned into a flying slasher flick, this time the slasher doesn't use a knife and flys around and grabs people. That's it. It's not a ghost like the story suggests. It's simply a flying Jason Vorhees. I thought it was suppose go after kids that saw it, not go after everybody it sees! It was just appearing everywhere everytime the lights went off. Sometime in the movie, it suddenly appears in the police station. This is where it really gets funny, the police officers see it and start shooting at it. It was flying around the room and the officers were shooting the lights out, letting the thing get them. First of all, why would a ghost appear in a police station? Just to get the main character? That one scene was inserted for pure action. Things get even more stupid at the end.

744968,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00008LUNW,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 4]","""Darkness Falls"" is the type of movie that flies in under the radar and hits you with some nice surprises.  It's kinda spooky, kinda scary and kinda silly all at once.  First of all, it relies on the fact that we all know about the tooth fairy.  Then it takes that fact, whips it into a frenzy and turns the sweet ol' tooth fairy into one wicked you know what.  The story falls before you like an old fashioned horror flick that relies more on camera angles, suspenseful music and the ""potential"" for danger.  Although you get to see the creature early on, you never get a really good look at her, but you know she is always there and will strike when given the chance.Other reviewers compare this movie to ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but I know not why.  Sure, the movie and the featurette on the DVD build up the background for the creature, but unlike ""Blair Witch,""  ""Darkness Falls"" didn't try for months ahead of its release to convince you that this story was ""true.""  And although both films use the potential for danger and creepy noises to set you up for ""jump-at-ya"" scares, ""Darkness Falls"" actually delivers.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" only gained popularity for the creative way that its creators conned moviegoers into seeing a supposedly scary flick that was just a major dissappointment.  ""Darkness Falls"" never promises that, and yet, it is a far better movie.""Darkness Falls"" is also a good Halloween flick for the younger crowd, although I would stick to letting kids over 12 seeing it for the fact that it does get kind of gruesome.Even with a PG-13 rating, this movie is scarier than other R-rated flicks that rely on gore, sex and an over-abundance of violence.

Less fortunate was Kyle's mother, murdered in a night of raving terror from which Kyle has never recovered even twelve years later.  Now he's coming home to Darkness Falls, to confront his childhood fear, and save his beloved Caitlin and her younger brother from a nightmarish doom...Though it got off to a good start at the box office in 2003, DARKNESS FALLS quickly floundered and is not widely appreciated by many horror fans.  Despite its decidedly mixed reviews from fans and critics alike, DARKNESS FALLS won me over the first time I saw it and it continues to entertain today.Exploring both humanity's general fear of the dark as well as the theme of childhood trauma that can shape one's life forever, DARKNESS FALLS is a fast-moving supernatural thriller that scores high marks for an original concept, interesting monster, empathetic characters, and atmospheric suspense.  Chaney Kley captures all of Kyle's angst and obsessiveness perfectly, and Emma Caulfield is appealing as Kyle's childhood sweetheart Caitlin, caught up in a nightmare from which she cannot awake.  Children in peril are often a bust in scary movies, but Lee Cormie is excellent in his role as the benighted Michael and provides a highly believable catalyst to bring Kyle and Caitlin back together.  The monster is scary and realistic, another knockout job from Stan Winston Studio, and turning the Tooth Fairy legend on its darkside makes for an ingenious and decidedly wicked new bogeyman.One reason DARKNESS FALLS disappointed at the box office is that it is, after all, a PG-13 film in a genre in which a very hard ""R"" rating is par for the course.  Lacking the splattering gore of many horror films, as well as the gratuitous nudity, DARKNESS FALLS perhaps came across as too ""tame"" for some.  Director Jonathan Liebesman took a lot of the blame, but unnecessarily so, as the look, feel, and pacing of DARKNESS FALLS are all excellent.  Often compared to the more popular THE RING, DARKNESS FALLS is clearly a very different movie, sharing with its rival only the theme of a haunted child.Though mine may be a minority opinion, I consider DARKNESS FALLS to be perhaps the best horror movie since the remake of THE MUMMY in the 90s.  Relying more on creativity for its shocks than the normal blood & guts, DARKNESS FALLS succeeds at least in part because it doesn't give in to certain genre conventions.  If you're looking for something different in a scary movie, give DARKNESS FALLS a try--I don't think you'll be disappointed.",4,WELCOME TO DARKNESS FALLS,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,2594,"['young', 'boy', 'Kyle', 'Walsh', 'saw', 'something', 'one', 'supposed', 'see', 'live', 'Less', 'fortunate', 'was', 'Kyle', 'mother', 'murdered', 'night', 'raving', 'terror', 'Kyle', 'never', 'recovered', 'even', 'twelve', 'years', 'later', 'Now', 'coming', 'home', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'confront', 'childhood', 'fear', 'save', 'beloved', 'Caitlin', 'younger', 'brother', 'nightmarish', 'doom', 'got', 'off', 'good', 'start', 'box', 'office', '2003', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'quickly', 'floundered', 'not', 'widely', 'appreciated', 'many', 'horror', 'fans', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'fans', 'critics', 'alike', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'won', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'entertain', 'today.Exploring', 'humanity', 'general', 'fear', 'dark', 'as', 'well', 'theme', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'can', 'shape', 'one', 'life', 'forever', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'fast-moving', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'high', 'marks', 'original', 'concept', 'interesting', 'monster', 'empathetic', 'characters', 'atmospheric', 'suspense', 'Chaney', 'Kley', 'Kyle', 'angst', 'obsessiveness', 'perfectly', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'appealing', 'Kyle', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Caitlin', 'caught', 'up', 'nightmare', 'can', 'not', 'awake', 'Children', 'peril', 'are', 'often', 'bust', 'scary', 'movies', 'Lee', 'Cormie', 'excellent', 'role', 'benighted', 'Michael', 'highly', 'believable', 'catalyst', 'bring', 'Kyle', 'Caitlin', 'back', 'together', 'monster', 'scary', 'realistic', 'knockout', 'job', 'Stan', 'Winston', 'Studio', 'turning', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'legend', 'darkside', 'ingenious', 'decidedly', 'wicked', 'new', 'bogeyman.One', 'reason', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'disappointed', 'box', 'office', 'PG-13', 'film', 'genre', 'very', 'hard', 'R', 'rating', 'par', 'course', 'Lacking', 'splattering', 'gore', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'perhaps', 'came', 'too', 'tame', 'Director', 'Jonathan', 'Liebesman', 'took', 'lot', 'blame', 'unnecessarily', 'so', 'look', 'feel', 'pacing', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'are', 'excellent', 'compared', 'more', 'popular', 'THE', 'RING', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'clearly', 'very', 'different', 'movie', 'sharing', 'rival', 'only', 'theme', 'haunted', 'child.Though', 'mine', 'may', 'be', 'minority', 'opinion', 'consider', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'be', 'perhaps', 'best', 'horror', 'movie', 'remake', 'THE', 'MUMMY', '90s', 'Relying', 'more', 'creativity', 'shocks', 'normal', 'blood', 'guts', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'least', 'part', ""n't"", 'give', 'certain', 'genre', 'conventions', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'scary', 'movie', 'give', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'try', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

After the disappearance of 2 town children, blamed on the woman ""tooth fairy"", she was wrongfully put to death and subsequently cursed the town when the 2 children were found alive and well.The focal character is a child who, after losing a tooth in the movie's beginning, peeks at the tooth fairy creature (stemming from the curse) and is pursued and tormented to no end.  It seems that the only way to avoid the terror of this creature is not to look at it directly, according to legend.  Those who do look at it full in the face have a date with death.In the essence of not being a spoiler and giving away too much plot, suffice it to say that an eventual battle ensues against this sinister entity in Darkness Falls after it repeatedly attacks town residents and causes general mayhem.In good faith, I'll refrain from calling this movie a top notch suspense thriller but it doesn't fall flat by any means either.  The plot may be called too manufactured by some or maybe underdone by others in some areas but there are a surprisingly good number of creepy scenes that make you jump.  The camera work is nicely done and the special effects are worth their weight.  The creature itself may be reminiscent of other horror movies to a degree but the way it is employed in the movie appears to be interesting and impressive.Although not destined for greatness in the horror genre of films, Darkness Falls was an honest attempt at some good thrills and chills.

What you basically have here is a cross between the wrong person being killed a long time ago from &quot;The Blair Witch Project,&quot; the creature that only comes out under certain circumstances from the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; movies, and the white mask from the &quot;Halloween&quot; movies.  Now, what made the first Freddy Kreuger movie work was that there were these clear cut rules that actually came into play with the climax of the film.  But in &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; the rules really do not explain what is happening on screen and the gross violations kill any momentum that the story might be generating.Because the town lynched an innocent woman she takes her revenge by coming after kids when they lose the last of their baby teeth.  But she only comes after you if you take a peek and look at her when she comes at night, because otherwise the town of Darkness Falls would have nothing but pre-teens and adults who moved into town.  At the beginning of the film she comes for young Kyle Walsh (Joshua Anderson) who had just lost his last tooth, but gets his mother instead.  Kyle is institutionalized because it is assumed that he killed his mother, despite the lack of forensic evidence to support the idea, but also because he is now afraid of the dark.  But little Caitlin Greene (Emily Browning) believes in Kyle and their paths cross several years later.Now the problem is Michael (Lee Cormie), the young brother of Caitlin (Emma Caulfield), who can only sleep for about ten minutes at a time because he has been totally afraid of the dark for three weeks.  Nobody thinks to just let the kid sleep with the lights on when he drops off from sheer exhaustion or to just knock him out with tranquilizers.  Instead, Caitlin brings Kyle (Chaney Kley) back to the hometown where everybody thinks he murdered his mom to help.  Kley's performance as the hero is pretty good for this particular genre, although Caulfield is not given anything substantive to do, which is a shame since you know the primary reason I checked out this 2003 film was that it had a &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; cast member in it.But once the lights start going out &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; starts to fail, big time.  This is a film that offers no suspense (if the lights go out, the tooth fairy shows up) and no gore (she takes her victims away into the darkness, or, more accurately, the darker part of the darkness, otherwise we would never see anything).  Then we get to the big finale and the rules go out the lighthouse window.  Director Jonathan Liebesman is certainly competent, but the screenplay by John Fasano, James Vanderbilt, and Joseph Harris just presents too many problems with the story that there is nothing that can be done by the director or the actors to save this one in the end.",3,"You know, you really can fall asleep with all the lights on",1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,2918,"['quot', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'quot', 'monster', 'dark', 'coming', 'get', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'What', 'basically', 'have', 'here', 'cross', 'wrong', 'person', 'being', 'killed', 'long', 'time', 'quot', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'quot', 'creature', 'only', 'out', 'certain', 'circumstances', 'quot', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'quot', 'movies', 'white', 'mask', 'quot', 'Halloween', 'quot', 'movies', 'Now', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'Freddy', 'Kreuger', 'movie', 'work', 'was', 'were', 'clear', 'cut', 'rules', 'actually', 'came', 'play', 'climax', 'film', 'quot', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'quot', 'rules', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'explain', 'what', 'happening', 'screen', 'gross', 'violations', 'kill', 'momentum', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'generating.Because', 'town', 'lynched', 'innocent', 'woman', 'revenge', 'coming', 'kids', 'when', 'lose', 'last', 'baby', 'teeth', 'only', 'take', 'peek', 'look', 'when', 'night', 'otherwise', 'town', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'would', 'have', 'nothing', 'pre-teens', 'adults', 'who', 'moved', 'town', 'beginning', 'film', 'young', 'Kyle', 'Walsh', 'Joshua', 'Anderson', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'lost', 'last', 'tooth', 'mother', 'instead', 'Kyle', 'institutionalized', 'assumed', 'killed', 'mother', 'lack', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'support', 'idea', 'also', 'now', 'afraid', 'dark', 'little', 'Caitlin', 'Greene', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'Kyle', 'paths', 'several', 'years', 'later.Now', 'problem', 'Michael', 'Lee', 'Cormie', 'young', 'brother', 'Caitlin', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'sleep', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'time', 'been', 'totally', 'afraid', 'dark', 'three', 'weeks', 'Nobody', 'just', 'let', 'kid', 'sleep', 'lights', 'when', 'sheer', 'exhaustion', 'just', 'knock', 'out', 'tranquilizers', 'Instead', 'Caitlin', 'Kyle', 'Chaney', 'Kley', 'back', 'hometown', 'where', 'everybody', 'murdered', 'mom', 'help', 'Kley', 'performance', 'hero', 'pretty', 'good', 'particular', 'genre', 'Caulfield', 'not', 'given', 'anything', 'substantive', 'do', 'shame', 'know', 'primary', 'reason', 'checked', 'out', '2003', 'film', 'was', 'had', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'quot', 'cast', 'member', 'it.But', 'lights', 'start', 'going', 'out', 'quot', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'quot', 'fail', 'big', 'time', 'film', 'suspense', 'lights', 'go', 'out', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'up', 'gore', 'victims', 'away', 'darkness', 'more', 'accurately', 'darker', 'part', 'darkness', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'Then', 'get', 'big', 'finale', 'rules', 'go', 'out', 'lighthouse', 'window', 'Director', 'Jonathan', 'Liebesman', 'certainly', 'competent', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Fasano', 'James', 'Vanderbilt', 'Joseph', 'Harris', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'problems', 'story', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'director', 'actors', 'save', 'one', 'end']",N/A

The spooky beginning shows some real promise, as well as chills and thrills, but quickly careens into disaster, providing the viewer with nothing much but sheer boredom with an occasional thrill tossed in just to make sure that the viewer is still breathing.The premise of the film is simple. About a hundred and fifty years ago in the town  of  Darkness Falls, an old woman used to give young children gold coins in exchange for their baby teeth. When two children turned up missing, a mob mentality overtook the town. The townspeople, blaming the old woman for the disappearance of the two children, hanged her for her supposed crime, but not before the old woman cursed the town and all in it. Later, the two missing children turned up alive and well. Oops!Over the years, legend has it that the ghost of this woman, now known as the tooth fairy, murders those children who see her when she comes to get their baby teeth. About sixteen years ago, a young boy saw the tooth fairy and lived to tell the tale. Unfortunately, his mother did not fare as well. Confined psychiatrically, he returns, as a young man,  to his home town of Darkness Falls, where he finds his childhood sweetheart's baby brother being pursued relentlessly by this tooth fairy. Therein lies the tale.With  a script that would not pass muster in Writing 101, as it lacks intelligence and cohesiveness, as well as ham-handed directing and editing that leaves much to be desired, this is a film that simply does not pass muster. At times incomprehensible and down right ridiculous,  the film boils down to pure drivel. Its initial promise in term of plot remains unfulfilled, and the film ultimately fails in its execution. All those participating in this production are hampered by the silly script, which does not provide the actors with much with which to work.Save your money and do not buy this film.

744979,A3013MHSQS4Y8Y,B00008LUNW,lobohombreriera,"[2, 4]","So finally I went against my better judgment and rented ""Darkness Falls"". The only thing that really scared me about this movie is how bad it was. It's just what's wrong about the genre these days. It seems like most horror films have become just an excuse to pared some fancy CGI effects, which is just the case with this awful, awful ghost story. The ""Tooth Fairy"" (the monster in this farce of a movie) is as scary as a ride in the Tunnel O'Love, and what seemed like an interesting concept (a legendary ghost that can only appear in total darkness and haunts you forever if you see its face) very soon turned into a succession of nonsense. The characters not only lack any motivation, but they're also just a mangled bunch of clich&eacute;s: the tormented hero, the female love interest (late 20's, pretty and vulnerable) and of course, the weird kid that just HAS to appear in every horror movie since ""The Sixth Sense"" became a hit.I won't even talk about the DVD edition. The commentary with the director is mildly interesting, but the one with the writers is too much, since they really can't make you become at least interested in this phlop that lacks any intelligence whatsoever. As for the rest of the material, it's mostly promotional stuff, so you won't need that anyway.I usually don't write bad reviews because I don't wish to waste my time with movies I won't recommend, but I was so enraged by this one that I felt like I had to warn everyone I could. If you must see a horror movie of the past year, you're much better off with Verbinski's remake of ""The Ring"" that you would ever will be with this one.

744981,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00008LUNW,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 4]","Our story begins in the town of Darkness Falls. Naturally all towns in New England are on the coast, all have a lighthouse, and all have unusual names. Darkness Falls has an interesting curse. Once upon a time there was a kindly old lady who gave children gifts in exchange for their baby teeth. The biggest problem with the old lady was that she was horribly disfigured from a fire and wore a mask. Of course the local townspeople suspected something kinky about the old lady, and when two children disappeared she was blamed and hung. However, before she was hung she laid a curse upon the town. At this point the story reminds me somewhat of John Carpenter's ""The Fog"", or the beginning of ""Salem's Lot"".Once we have this history out of the way, we meet a young boy who loses his last baby tooth, and, as many of us did when we were his age, we put the tooth under our pillow hoping to have it exchanged for a gift. Unfortunately, in the town of Darkness Falls if you look at the ghost of the old lady playing the tooth fairy, she kills you in a horrible way. The boy in our story sees the old lady and manages to get away. His mother tells the boy it's all in his mind and goes to check out the noise. You need little imagination to know what comes next. Our hero is taken away to another town, and everyone in Darkness Falls thinks he's crazy and many think he killed his mother.We fast forward 12 years to find that the young boy (our hero), has an intense fear of the dark, and never goes into the dark. He usually carries around bags of flashlights, flares, and a variety of other devices to assure he'll never be in the dark, because the dark is where the mask-wearing ghost of the old lady hides (light burns her, so she stays out of it). A woman he knew as a girl in Darkness Falls calls him for help because her brother has started to act in the same weird way that he did, and isn't it nice how he has grown out of his childhood fears. She will learn soon enough that he hasn't grown out of those fears.Our hero comes back to Darkness Falls to do battle with the old lady, or at least we hope so. The middle portion of the movie may remind some ardent horror fans of the cat and mouse chases with the werewolf in Stephen King's movie ""Silver Bullet"". After a number of false starts in battling the old woman, she really gets into her killing and our hero gets into running away. In fact, I'm not sure the movie ever would have ended had the old lady not chased our hero down.While some parts of the movie were a bit cheesy, I like the general concept. I particularly appreciated that the director did not need blood glopping all over the place to describe the various deaths. There were a few places where I jumped. There were a number of cliches, but in this day and age it is difficult to avoid all cliche.I thought this movie was decent. Not great, but in the same general league as the recent movie ""Ghost Ship"", though with less creativity. I think this movie is a must-see for horror fans and those for whom horror movies are occasional indulgences. For people who are not horror fans and yet have watched many horror films, you might want to pass this one by.

One night two children go missing from the village and the town blame her and burn her at the stake. the next morning the children are found alive and well.

One day this lady was accused of being a witch and was badly burned leaving her disfigured. From that moment on, she vowed to take revenge on those who had hurt her after she performed so many acts of kindness.

The lead actors (Chaney and Emma) are pretty to look at and the kid does a darn good job doing generic American accent!The director's commentary is pretty light hearted with the homages to other films and 'gives good hallway' comments. The writer's seemed a bit, mmm, self important? but did explain a lot in the way of how the story was initially scripted out and subsequent rewrites and reshoots changed the story from 'Is Kyle a psycho killer' to Kyle, the hero as well the 'rules' to the tooth fairy changing from rewrite to rewrite.I might add again that Chaney is quite easy on the eyes.French dubbing was quite good too.As for the lack of gore- well it *is* PG-13...Young Kyle reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio. I don't get the age difference between young Kyle losing his last tooth (12?) and Caitlin's kid brother (7? 8?). Isn't that a bit young to be losing your 'last' baby tooth? Maybe he's just a really frail  10-11 yr old.A lot of the reviews have good points. And I am glad I did not see this in a theater for $$$...

745000,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00008LUNW,OverTheMoon,"[2, 3]","Darkness Falls is not the worst horror film you will ever see. Yes it does have lots of stereotypical horror moments... but it also boasts some original and clever ideas. After 30 minutes of Darkness Falls you will get what this is about and what you think of it will depend on how insane you think the ghost is. I think that the ghost was very well done and the fight sequences a joy, but the story is awfully written without much memorable dialogue, characters or a plot (which is never fully explained).Let's not beat around the bush here. I would recommend Darkness Falls to anybody who can have a laugh at the ghost flying around the town killing whoever she chooses for reasons that are never fully explained either. In fact the whole background story of a local woman `tooth-fairy' who was wrongly executed for the double murder of two boys does not matter much. Yes, the opening sequence is frightening, but after that this is just 100% action all the way.... and at its heart Darkness Falls is exactly that...... a ""No-brainer action/horror"".So if that is your genre and if you think that a ghost that only attacks people in darkness (the protagonists use torches and must avoid dark spots to survive) then you actually might have some fun with this one. I know this film is terribly bad, 2 star material, but the fact that the ghost was just so well done and the action sequences quite entertaining, merits this movie a little more than 2 stars for me and possibly pushes the 3 boundary... but not by much.In short watch it for the opening sequence, the ghost and the action. Forget about the characters and plot. This is pure pop-corn fodder, but do not avoid it just because it has a terrible plot (the main reason for the bad reviews but the ghost and the action is 100% fun). If you want to see an intelligent horror this year then watch ""Frailty"" instead. If you can forgive the film for its story found in a cornflakes pack and just enjoy the insanity of a ghost flying around the place and attacking people in dark spots then who knows?... you just might actually like it a little.

Later, woman is horribly disfigured in a fire, and is seldom seen, and if she is, she's wearing a porcelain mask.  When some kids go missing, the Tooth Fairy is blamed and promptly lynched by the town, who, as the ultimate humiliation, also tear off her mask, exposing her horrible injuried for the world to see.  Later, the children are found safe and sound, but by then, she has cursed the children of Darkness Falls.  If, when she comes to collect their last tooth, a child sees the Tooth Fairy, they will be killed, unless they always stay in the light.  She hates that light, see.Oh my.  But even if one accepts the silliness of this device, perhaps we'll get some decent chills along the way?  Well, no.  We first meet our lead character, whose name I don't remember a mere hour after enduring the movie, when he manages to see the Tooth Fairy as a child.  His mother is killed and he is blamed (for NO good reason) and taken to an asylum, where he spends some amount of years hiding in the light and having a hard time sleeping...you'd think you might get used to sleeping with some lights on, but what do I know?Years later, another boy is in the same situation, only this time, his much older sister (who happens to be the lead characters' long-ago sweetheart) drags our lead character back to Darkness Falls to ""help"" her troubled younger brother.  Naturally, no one believes these two sufferers of the tooth fairy curse, but everywhere they go, the tooth fairy swoops down and takes another victim.The movie is PG-13, so the killings are pretty tame, and pretty much the same.  Tooth Fairy can sorta fly, so she usually drops on her victim and then up into the air with them she goes.  Naturally it's always dark when she does this, so we don't see any of it very clearly.  But no one cares anyway.At one point in the movie, we meet our adult male lead, now living far away from Darkness Falls, and we see that he's got drawings all over his wall of a porcelain faced figure.  When he sees that the little boy has also drawn a similar figure, he apparently decides to make it his life's mission to save the boy.  What is it in horror movies that the hero so often draws sketches of the ""horrible"" thing they've seen.  If I saw something horrible, I wouldn't be able to sketch it...can't draw worth a hill of beans.  Or maybe being scared would make me artistic?  Or maybe only artistic people get scared?  This is such a cliche, and in this film, if falls even flatter than usual.Mostly the movie involves every one running around, trying to stay in light and shooting guns at her...to no effect.  Nearly everyone dies and we, the viewer, are unable to muster up even one ounce of concern or caring.  The movie generates not one smidgen of tension.  And there is no humor, either...it takes itself VERY seriously. Everyone involved in the movie:  director, screenwriter, actors (all unknown to me), cinematograher, editor, scorer have NO business in show business!!!(The only worse horror I have seen is FEAR DOT COM, which is equally incompetent, but I hate even more because some of the cast members are actually good actors (usually) and because the movie is so ICKY.)

745007,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00008LUNW,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 4]","Darkness Falls (Jason Liebesman, 2003)Somehow I never got round to reviewing this. Which is okay, because everyone's already said everything I have to say about it, but hey.This movie is probably going to end a lot of careers before they begin, and could have deleterious effects on a few others. I watched it (well, because I like bad horror movies) mostly because Emma Caulfield is hot and I could never stand enough of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to get a good enough fix. This ain't much better, but at least I could sit through it.The Tooth Fairy (Antony Burrows in his big-screen debut, also a stuntman for the lead actor: what a surprise, a stuntman playing a monster) is a ghost who's been exceptionally pissed at a small town for a hundred fifty years. Every time a child loses his first tooth, he's visited by the tooth fairy, and if he's not asleep... well, trauma. Or the brutal and bloody murder of one's parents which then gets pinned on the kid, as happened to Kyle Walsh (Legally Blonde's Chaney Kley). Kyle, not surprisingly, split town after that for a while. No one believes in the Tooth Fairy (of course), and they all think Kyle's nuts (of course), but he comes back to town to save the son of his high school sweetheart, Caitlin (Caulfield). He's being stalked by the Tooth Fairy, as well.First, just to get this out of the way: enough with the new age psychology crap already. Oh, boy, childhood trauma. Yeah, that hasn't been horribly overdone. (No one uses the words ""inner child,"" but they're written all over Kley's face throughout. Try not to puke.)Second, pretty much everything bad you can say about this movie, well, you can say. The acting is hideous, the pace is off, the jumps out of your seat feel more like you settling your butt deeper into the chair. I was more scared by the last Mary Kate and Ashley movie.That said, there are two very above-average things about this flick. The special effects are tremendous, as is to be expected; the Tooth Fairy was designed by Stan Winston. Nuff said. Also, the direction has something going for it. Had Liebesman been able to put together as good a cast as found in, say, The Ring (or even as good a bad cast as found in, say, Cabin Fever), this might have been a wonderful little sleeper.

I only give it one extra star because the whole idea of the movie sounded quite interesting. But even at the very beginning of the movie it did not make any sense. The whole plot of the movie was that a man comes back to his home town where he hasn't been since his mother was murdered that he was accused of. He comes back only because his old girlfriend has asked him to help her brother who seems to be seeing the same creature in the dark that the man swore killed his mother years back.Sound like a steady, concrete story line, and yet it isn't. There were already questions I was asking at the very beginning of the movie. Like why did this dangerous version of the Tooth Fairy (she looks more like a wicked old witch to me) kill the man's mother in the beginning anyway? I thought she only killed, as the legend goes, kids who lost their last tooth? And on and on do the questions go. And much worse, the actors did not at all seem believable. Overall, the movie never scared me whatsoever. At the end of the film I begun to fall asleep, and that's a bad thing when you watch a horror movie.

I knew it would bring nothing intelligent to the table, but still I figured it could manage a cheap teenagers-in-peril kind of thrill.  And for about 10 minutes, it did.  The opening attack is downright chilling (especially if you have surround sound and are watching in pitch black at about 2am.  The screeching slowly arising from behind you will give you goosebumps.)  Also, the premise wasn't silly in theory to me.  Some of the most horrifying images are of traditionally good things being turned evil (evil clowns, evil dogs, evil cops . . . and so forth).  Really, the premise packed alot of promise.Then, the rest of the movie happened.  Instead of giving us a batch of teenagers with angst and hormones getting offed one at a time, we are given two boring adults and one annoying child.  Rather than attempting to explain why Matilda suddenly comes back to attack, and why she can only kill you if you see her, or just exactly how much light do you need to repel her - instead it is just ""Hide here, get attacked there . . . repeat 50 times.""  The ""monster"" is not remotely scary looking, with or without the mask.  And the one scene that seemed really creepy to me in the trailer (the girl walking down the dark hallway trying not to look at the monster) was DELETED out of the finished film!  You can still see it in the deleted scenes - but it loses all of it's chilliness being out of context and in low-grade video display.So, is it even worth a rent?

Stupid, huh? Ya.....Whenever you lose a tooth, your told not to peek otherwise it will kill you, ya....However, it suddenly turns out that the tooth fairy starts haunting everyone. But their is a twist. The tooth fairy only comes out in the dark.The story starts about a young boy who loses a tooth. They live in a rather large house, and its time for him to go to bed. The mom tucks him in and tells him ""not to peek."" Hes fast asleep and hears something. He worries, so he goes to his mom and tells her that he heard something. Of course, she doesn't believe him. However, she goes in the room and gets brutally cut to death by the monster. (This scene was actually the best in the entire movie.)The movie then jumps to 12 years later when he is a grown man. He is married to his girlfriend that he had since he was a young boy, and they had this kid named Michael who is suffering the same images of the tooth fairy that the husband is.So the story is basically him, his girlfriend, and the young boy Michael trying to stop the tooth fairy. (*yawn!*) You see, where this movie really fails is that its just not scary, (horror movies are ment to be scary by the way) its just a whole hunk of junk, the enemy tooth fairy is this ghoulish cheesy dump of goo, (you see its face at the end, because they manage to rip its mask off and kill it) and the scipt is one of the worst scrips i've ever seen in horror movie history.The action scenes are pitiful, no suspense, everything was predictable, not enough storyline to actually make it addicting and worth watching, and lets just say that this movie is just wasting your time. (i hate it when directors waste their time with movies like this!)So in conclusion, if i was able to i would give this 0 stars but the minimum is one, so i guess i give it 1 star.",1,The biggest excuse for a horror movie i've ever sat through!,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,2300,"['Let', 'just', 'start', 'review', 'saying', 'i', 'have', 'seriousely', 'seen', 'movie', 'can', 'think', 'ever', 'genre', 'horror', 'action', 'comedy', 'adventure', 'anything', 'Let', 'continue', 'review', 'saying', 'one', 'most', 'pitiful', 'excuses', 'horror', 'movie', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'entire', 'life', 'honesty', 'i', 'turned', 'off', 'fist', 'one', 'hour', 'i', 'sure', 'hell', 'know', 'enough', 'piece', 'garbage', 'i', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'review.Basically', 'haunted', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'loose', 'Stupid', 'huh', 'Ya', '..Whenever', 'lose', 'tooth', 'told', 'not', 'peek', 'otherwise', 'will', 'kill', '.However', 'suddenly', 'out', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'haunting', 'everyone', 'twist', 'tooth', 'only', 'out', 'dark.The', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'tooth', 'live', 'rather', 'large', 'house', 'time', 'go', 'bed', 'mom', 'tells', 'not', 'peek', 'Hes', 'fast', 'asleep', 'something', 'mom', 'heard', 'something', 'course', ""n't"", 'believe', 'However', 'room', 'brutally', 'cut', 'death', 'monster', 'scene', 'was', 'actually', 'best', 'entire', 'movie', 'movie', 'then', '12', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'grown', 'man', 'married', 'girlfriend', 'had', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'had', 'kid', 'named', 'Michael', 'who', 'suffering', 'same', 'images', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'husband', 'story', 'basically', 'girlfriend', 'young', 'boy', 'Michael', 'trying', 'stop', 'tooth', 'fairy', '*yawn', '*', 'see', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'not', 'scary', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'ment', 'be', 'scary', 'way', 'just', 'whole', 'hunk', 'junk', 'enemy', 'fairy', 'ghoulish', 'cheesy', 'dump', 'goo', 'see', 'face', 'end', 'manage', 'rip', 'mask', 'kill', 'scipt', 'one', 'worst', 'scrips', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'horror', 'movie', 'history.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'pitiful', 'suspense', 'everything', 'was', 'predictable', 'not', 'enough', 'storyline', 'actually', 'make', 'addicting', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'just', 'wasting', 'time', 'i', 'hate', 'when', 'directors', 'waste', 'time', 'movies', 'So', 'conclusion', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'i', 'would', 'give', '0', 'stars', 'minimum', 'one', 'i', 'guess', 'i', 'give', '1', 'star']",N/A

If you saw one, you saw both.In both DARKNESS FALLS and THEY, children are targeted by a monster that lurks in darkness and fears the light.  Children see the monster, grow up into sexy twentysomethings, and the monster pursues them.  One of them trie to convince the others that the monster is real.In both films people suffer from ""night tremors"" and can't get much sleep.  The monster picks people off in both films.Both films are low-budget with few extras, so they look sparsely populated.  Both films are real short, running about an hour and 15 minutes, not including credits.  Both films are shot outside the US.  DARKNESS FALLS in Australia, THEY in Canada.There are some slight variations.  In DARKNESS FALLS the beauty is quicker to believe the guy.  In DARKNESS FALLS the monster is the Tooth Fairy, in THEY it's some sort of demon.  THEY has a darker ending.Despite the variations, as I watched DARKNESS FALLS, I quickly felt, ""Hey, I've seen this before!  This is like that other horror movie about night tremors.""Both merit a three-star rating.  They're both smallish horror films, reasonably entertaining -- but only for hardcore horror fans who are forgiving.  If you're not the sort of person who sees and enjoys almost every horror film, you may wish to pass this by for a first-rate horror film.  There are many: LOST SOULS, SIXTH SENSE, THE HAUNTING (the 1963 film), THE SENTINEL, and many more.Finally, DARKNESS FALLS has ridiculous script bloopers.  For instance, a group of hospital patients and staff are trying to escape a hospital.  A nurse pops out and demands to know what's going on.  She's told about the Tooth Fairy.  She asks, ""Should I evacuate the other patients?""They tell her, No, the Tooth Fairy can only pursue you if you've seen her face.  The other patients haven't.  Neither has this nurse.  They're all safe.So then, this nurse should return to the other patients, right?NOT what the idiot filmmakers have her do!This nurse accompanies these other patients and hospital staff, all of whom have seen the Tooth Fairy and are thus a danger to be around.  Amazingly, none of them scream, ""Hey, we JUST TOLD YOU that you were safe!  Don't follow us!  Go back to the other patients!""Naturally, this nurse is the first one killed by the Tooth Fairy.Sloppy scriptwriting at its worst.",3,IDENTICAL to Wes Craven Presents They,1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,2422,"['DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'near', 'carbon', 'copy', 'WES', 'CRAVEN', 'PRESENTS', 'THEY', 'was', 'released', 'year', 'before', 'saw', 'one', 'saw', 'both.In', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'THEY', 'children', 'are', 'targeted', 'monster', 'darkness', 'light', 'Children', 'see', 'monster', 'grow', 'up', 'sexy', 'twentysomethings', 'monster', 'One', 'trie', 'convince', 'others', 'monster', 'real.In', 'films', 'people', 'suffer', 'night', 'tremors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'sleep', 'monster', 'people', 'off', 'films.Both', 'films', 'are', 'low-budget', 'few', 'extras', 'look', 'sparsely', 'populated', 'films', 'are', 'real', 'short', 'running', 'hour', '15', 'minutes', 'not', 'including', 'credits', 'films', 'are', 'shot', 'US', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'Australia', 'THEY', 'Canada.There', 'are', 'slight', 'variations', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'beauty', 'quicker', 'believe', 'guy', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'monster', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'THEY', 'sort', 'demon', 'THEY', 'darker', 'variations', 'watched', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'quickly', 'felt', 'Hey', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'other', 'horror', 'movie', 'night', 'tremors', 'merit', 'three-star', 'rating', ""'re"", 'smallish', 'horror', 'films', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'only', 'hardcore', 'horror', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'forgiving', ""'re"", 'not', 'sort', 'person', 'who', 'almost', 'horror', 'film', 'may', 'wish', 'pass', 'first-rate', 'horror', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'LOST', 'SOULS', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', '1963', 'film', 'THE', 'SENTINEL', 'many', 'more.Finally', 'DARKNESS', 'FALLS', 'ridiculous', 'script', 'bloopers', 'instance', 'group', 'hospital', 'patients', 'staff', 'are', 'trying', 'escape', 'hospital', 'nurse', 'pops', 'demands', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'told', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Should', 'evacuate', 'other', 'patients', 'tell', 'No', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'can', 'only', 'pursue', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'face', 'other', 'patients', 'have', ""n't"", 'nurse', ""'re"", 'safe.So', 'then', 'nurse', 'should', 'return', 'other', 'patients', 'right', 'NOT', 'what', 'idiot', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'do', 'nurse', 'accompanies', 'other', 'patients', 'hospital', 'staff', 'whom', 'have', 'seen', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'are', 'thus', 'danger', 'be', 'around', 'Amazingly', 'none', 'scream', 'Hey', 'JUST', 'TOLD', 'YOU', 'were', 'safe', 'Do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Go', 'back', 'other', 'patients', 'Naturally', 'nurse', 'first', 'one', 'killed', 'Tooth', 'Fairy.Sloppy', 'scriptwriting', 'worst']",N/A

745029,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00008LUNW,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","The greatest part of &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; is its opening 15 minutes, in which you are informed that about 150 years ago a certain old lady Matilda is wrongly prosecuted by the townspeople in Darkness Falls (what a name...) for killing two kids, and she was put to death.  The vengeful soul comes back to the town of the present day, in the form of the Tooth Fairy, claiming the lives of the people of the place.I say again, the first section is great, spooky and scary, partly becasue of the participation of Kyle Cooper, one of the influential title designers in the film industry (his titleback of &quot;Se7en&quot; is now a classic).  But after that prologue, everything goes downward.The film uses the &quot;hero and heroine&quot; format, namely &quot;Kyle&quot;  (newcomer Chaney Kley) and Catlin (Emma Caulfield, &quot;Buffy, the Vampire Slayer&quot;).  They have to fend off the evil soul of Matilda, which dislikes the light, while the body counts rise, but the way the film shows them is devoid of imagination, originality, and worst of all, scares.  The tactics the film uses is the kind of &quot;shock&quot; like sudden banging noise, and the decerning fans of horror genre would be bored with the result.Probably, the most embarrassing thing is the film's basic idea of &quot;fear the darkness&quot; which has been used much effectively in &quot;Pitch Black.&quot;  To make matter more uncomfortable, the similar concept recently showed up in the little-seen film &quot;They,&quot; and one recent Spanish occult thriller (featuring Anna Paquin and Lena Olin) uses it again, of which name incidentally &quot;Darkness.&quot;  What a coincidence, or maybe lack of creativity.While I was watching &quot;Darkness Falls,&quot; and one of the characters say &quot;Stay in the light,&quot; I was wondering, like,  &quot;So why not live in Las Vegas?&quot;  And next moment, the film jumps exactly to the place I imagined.

This almost becomes a copy of Pitch Black with a lean towards dentistry, though not even in the same legue as Pitch Black. What's funny is how sometimes the &quot;demon&quot; can swoop into the light, and sometimes it can't.

Plot -A demented tooth fairy out for blood!2.  The mask worn by the demented tooth fairy.I loved the idea of taking such a pleasant child hood tale and twisting it into a demented story, but the movie itself was bland.  It might have been a bit better if they expanded to it cover more victims....and not had her only chasing a small group of boring people.  It almost seemed beneath her to keep chasing the older guy.  I kept thinking, ""Just kill him and be done with it already!  There are so many more people to terrorize.""",3,tooth fairy reeks havoc!,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,709,"['phantom', 'who', 'last', 'baby', 'tooth', 'child', 'town', '.and', 'make', 'mistake', 'peeking', ""'re"", 'doomed', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'good', 'things', 'movie:1', 'Plot', '-A', 'demented', 'fairy', 'out', 'blood', '2', 'mask', 'worn', 'demented', 'tooth', 'fairy.I', 'loved', 'idea', 'taking', 'such', 'pleasant', 'child', 'hood', 'tale', 'twisting', 'demented', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'bland', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'better', 'expanded', 'cover', 'more', 'victims', '.and', 'not', 'had', 'only', 'chasing', 'small', 'group', 'boring', 'people', 'almost', 'seemed', 'beneath', 'keep', 'chasing', 'older', 'guy', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Just', 'kill', 'be', 'done', 'already', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'people', 'terrorize']",N/A
