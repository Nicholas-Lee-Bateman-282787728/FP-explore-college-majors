871941,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006Q93CO,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 9]","Dave Chappelle is funny.  Ever since I witnessed his comedy in the form of his stand-up performances and on the infamous Dr. Katz, I thought Dave Chappelle was funny.  His blend of social issues coupled with pop culture references continually made me laugh.  One of his funniest routines involved Aquaman and the Justice League.  I even laughed further when he came out with Half Baked.  While most awarded it just another moment in Hollywood history filled with clich&eacute;s and bathroom humor, I saw it as a possible cult classic.  I want to repeat that I think Dave Chappelle is funny.  That is why it pains me so to say that his program on Comedy Central was not the best I have witnessed.As I know many of you are already hitting the ""disagree"" button on your screen, I would like to explain this statement further.  I do not have cable, so when the opportunity presents itself, I find renting full seasons of programs the better option.  Recently, I had the opportunity to see the second season of Dave Chappelle's show, and, much like the first season, wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be.  Sure, the first season had quite a bit of cutting edge humor coupled with shocking racial stereotypes, but it wasn't something I could watch over and over again.  There were some great skits, but as a whole, the first season lacked the intelligence to reach a huge audience as I witnessed in his stand-up comics.  Dave Chappelle was looking to make a name for himself, utterly change his image, and use his heritage as a joke.  For the first season that may have worked, but now for season two, it just feels cheap and most times, unoriginal.I like Dave Chappelle because he is original and not afraid to go one step further to either shock us or make us feel uncomfortable.  He is giving us a slice of American life that we are not accustomed to, but at times with the second season, it felt like he was forcing it upon us.  I found his humor to be lacking the original pizzazz that he brought with the first season.  Sure, there were skits that stood out (like the ""Rick James"" interview, Wayne Brady episode, and the Black President skit), but overall it didn't feel like the same Dave Chappelle that I first was introduced to.  It felt like he was attempting to outdo what he did originally without just trying to improve upon it.  For several episodes I felt like he created scenarios/skits that would shock instead of actually make you laugh.  I don't think that I would ever use the word ""offensive"" to describe his show, but there were some scenes (like the entire ""teaching children about sexual diseases"" skit) that just were not funny or not attempting to make a point, but rather see how gross one could be.  It felt as if several of these episodes he was teetering between attempting to appeal to an intellectual audience and that of a pre-teen audience.  Did Chappelle make a conscious decision to slow down on the smart humor and recreate the American Pie dream?  For this viewer, it felt like it.Again, there were several skits that reminded me of why I initially enjoyed the humor of Dave Chappelle.  I even liked the skit where the drug addicts goes on Fear Factor, but there were others that just felt cheap.  He overused the stereotypes to attempt to gain a laugh and make his image seem radical, when in fact the humor he was trying to create wasn't even funny.  The skit that initially comes to mind was the one with the white family with the racial last name.  That could have been hysterical, but instead it just felt bland and cheap.  Audience members were laughing, but I couldn't tell if it was an uncomfortable laugh or a pity laugh.  Maybe it is my choice of humor, but I love Dave Chappelle.  I think Comedy Central, in all of its glory, found that if Dave continued to use racial stereotypes to make humor (nearly at the wrong expense) than they had a hit show.  After the first season I believe that Comedy Central's influence on the show began making a bigger appearance, thus the quality went behind quantity.  Did anyone else notice the one 16-minute long episode?Overall, this second season did not impress me.  Again, he had some great skits that will remain a part of pop culture (aka the ""Rick James"" episode), but overall, his humor has changed.  I would even go so far as to say that Dave himself has changed.  His social/ethnic references and over-abuse of the series The Jeffersons started fun, but by the end just felt tired and old.  Even Dave didn't seem like he had that spunk when he first ran out on stage.  I will end with this thought.  Dave is a comedian, I do not believe that his shows warranted a musical guest appearance at the end.  I didn't have it much in the first season, so why build further upon it for the second.  I realize Dave has ""celebrity"" friends, but this is his show.  I want to see Dave; not some famed hip-hop group.  I love Dave's humor, I always will, but I do not think this show can keep the balance that it once was awarded.  His shock value is slowly turning annoying and is weaning down his range of comedy.  I realize that he can make a joke about his race, but there is so much more than he could laugh about ... I would like to see that side.  I miss you Dave Chappelle.Grade: ** out of *****",2,What did the five fingers say to the face?,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,5285,"['Dave', 'Chappelle', 'funny', 'Ever', 'witnessed', 'comedy', 'form',

Thank goodness I burned them all to DVD myself because once again, the powers that be are screwing the consumers over by telling us one thing and doing another.  As with the first season, we are allegedly getting the ""uncensored"" season of Dave Chappelle.  On closer examination, we see that there is censorship going on: even if it is of a financial nature.  The back DVD image displayed on DVD Empire dot com clearly shows the same B.S. statement that the first set showed: ""Some songs/musical performances features in the original broadcast versions of the show are not included on the DVD set.""Last time, ""some"" equated 7/11ths of the performances.  I wonder what percentage it'll be this time? *shakes head*  If one finds the comedic material presented on Chappelle's Show questionable or dubious, the thing most people could agree on is that the broadcast version at least showcases musical talent to which we might not otherwise be exposed.  If they cut that part out in any degree (for whatever reason), they severely diminish the overall cultural value of the show.  Of course, they're not primarily interested in cultural value, they're interested in monetary value, and I'm sure this represented the most profitable move for the studios.I love Dave, and I love his show's music. Out of respect for what he does and what the original shows represent, I will not be buying this edited DVD set.Another reviewer begged to differ with my assessment of the mismanagement of the season's release to DVD for a couple reasons.1. It's all about the comedy: not the music.2. The musical guests were all corporate puppets.First off, it's absolutely *NOT* just about the comedy...not from an objective standpoint.  That's like saying Letterman, Leno, and Conan are all about talking-head guests.  Simply not the case.  Each Chappelle show runs an average (paultry) 21 minutes from credit to credit.  A three minute guest musical spot is 1/7th of that time.  A four minute guest spot is about 1/5th.  These are some major minutes.  Multiplied by 13 episodes, we're missing between 39 and 52 minutes of performances: a significant sum of time for a show that itself runs ~260 minutes.Second, it was insinuated that the musical guests were just corporate drones doing the company (Paramount/Viacom) bidding.  Watching how Dave interacts with his musical guests, I don't believe that for a second.  It seems like Dave is the closest to his true self when he's interacting with the musical guests.  You can see how much the music means to him.  If that wasn't enough, Paramount/Viacom (which has its closest musical claws via Columbia/CBS records) doesn't manage *ANY* of the musical guests.  Rival, Universal, ultimately has the biggest thumb in that pie.  Here's the breakdown.DMX - Def Jam owned by UniversalLudacris - Def Jam owned by Universal.Cee-Lo - Arista owned by BMG.Kanye West - Roc-A-Fella distributed by Island Records owned by Universal.Erykah Badu - Motown owned by Universal.Wyclef Jean - Koch which is an indepedent label.Snoop Dogg - Geffen owned by Universal.Common - Geffen owned by Universal.Talib Kwali - Rawkus owned by MCA owned by Universal.Big Boi - Arista owned by BMG.Finally, if music wasn't an important part of Chappelle's Show, why did they have a full show devoted to musical guests, eh?  If a person didn't like the musical guests, they could just skip through them or turn the DVD off.  We're not even given that choice.",3,"Another Incomplete ""Uncensored"" Season :(",1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,3502,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'shows', 'know', 'what', 'content', 'hold', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'burned', 'DVD', 'because', 'once', 'again', 'powers', 'be', 'are', 'screwing', 'consumers', 'telling', 'one', 'thing', 'doing', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'allegedly', 'getting', 'uncensored', 'season', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'closer', 'examination', 'see', 'censorship', 'going', 'even', 'financial', 'nature', 'back', 'DVD', 'image', 'displayed', 'DVD', 'Empire', 'dot', 'com', 'clearly', 'same', 'B.S', 'statement', 'first', 'set', 'showed', 'songs/musical', 'performances', 'features', 'original', 'broadcast', 'versions', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'DVD', 'set', 'Last', 'time', 'equated', '7/11ths', 'performances', 'wonder', 'what', 'percentage', ""'ll"", 'be', 'time', '*shakes', 'head*', 'one', 'comedic', 'material', 'presented', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'questionable', 'dubious', 'thing', 'most', 'people', 'could', 'agree', 'broadcast', 'version', 'least', 'showcases', 'musical', 'talent', 'might', 'not', 'otherwise', 'be', 'exposed', 'cut', 'part', 'degree', 'reason', 'severely', 'diminish', 'overall', 'cultural', 'value', 'show', 'course', ""'re"", 'not', 'primarily', 'interested', 'cultural', 'value', ""'re"", 'interested', 'monetary', 'value', ""'m"", 'sure', 'represented', 'most', 'profitable', 'move', 'studios.I', 'love', 'Dave', 'love', 'show', 'music', 'respect', 'what', 'what', 'original', 'shows', 'represent', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'buying', 'edited', 'DVD', 'set.Another', 'reviewer', 'begged', 'differ', 'assessment', 'mismanagement', 'season', 'release', 'DVD', 'couple', 'reasons.1', 'comedy', 'not', 'music.2', 'musical', 'guests', 'were', 'corporate', 'puppets.First', 'absolutely', '*NOT*', 'just', 'comedy', 'not', 'objective', 'standpoint', 'saying', 'Letterman', 'Leno', 'Conan', 'are', 'talking-head', 'guests', 'Simply', 'not', 'case', 'Chappelle', 'show', 'average', 'paultry', '21', 'minutes', 'credit', 'credit', 'three', 'minute', 'guest', 'musical', 'spot', '1/7th', 'time', 'four', 'minute', 'guest', 'spot', '1/5th', 'are', 'major', 'minutes', 'Multiplied', '13', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'missing', '39', '52', 'minutes', 'performances', 'significant', 'sum', 'time', 'show', '~260', 'minutes.Second', 'was', 'insinuated', 'musical', 'guests', 'were', 'just', 'corporate', 'drones', 'doing', 'company', 'Paramount/Viacom', 'bidding', 'Watching', 'how', 'Dave', 'musical', 'guests', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'second', 'Dave', 'closest', 'true', 'self', 'when', 'interacting', 'musical', 'guests', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Paramount/Viacom', 'closest', 'musical', 'claws', 'Columbia/CBS', 'records', ""n't"", 'manage', '*ANY*', 'musical', 'guests', 'Rival', 'Universal', 'ultimately', 'biggest', 'thumb', 'pie', 'Here', 'breakdown.DMX', 'Def', 'Jam', 'owned', 'UniversalLudacris', 'Def', 'Jam', 'owned', 'Universal.Cee-Lo', 'Arista', 'owned', 'BMG.Kanye', 'West', 'Roc-A-Fella', 'distributed', 'Island', 'Records', 'owned', 'Universal.Erykah', 'Badu', 'Motown', 'owned', 'Universal.Wyclef', 'Jean', 'Koch', 'indepedent', 'label.Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Geffen', 'owned', 'Universal.Common', 'Geffen', 'owned', 'Universal.Talib', 'Kwali', 'Rawkus', 'owned', 'MCA', 'owned', 'Universal.Big', 'Boi', 'Arista', 'owned', 'BMG.Finally', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'important', 'part', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'why', 'did', 'have', 'full', 'show', 'devoted', 'musical', 'guests', 'eh', 'person', 'did', ""n't"", 'musical', 'guests', 'could', 'just', 'skip', 'turn', 'DVD', 'off', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'given', 'choice']",N/A
871943,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B0006Q93CO,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[2, 4]","Season two of Chappelle's Show isn't the best overall season. Season one still has the better collection of episodes and still introduced a lot of Chappelle's best characters, but season two has three very important things that couldn't be found in season one: ""Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories""; Dave's Lil Jon skits; and ""I Know Black People.""Firstly, Charlie Murphy's stories are some of the best I've ever heard, and in the fourth episode, we get to see the Rick James story, complete with Rick James himself there to prove the story is true. This is the funniest skit of both seasons; the fact that now you can hear everyone today going around shouting the catchphrase heard in this episode proves this. Charlie Murphy also talks about Prince and has a few extra moments on the special features DVD. Like the Rick James episode, Dave's Lil Jon has since spawned about four or five more catchphrases. And ""I Know Black People"" plays out like a real game show where Dave asks questions dealing with black people, rap, or any other subject closely related to those two. The he asks are varied with people who seem both hip to the subjects and people who look as if they should know nothing about it. The funny thing about this game show is who ends up winning, and also some of the answers given to Dave's questions.Other good skits include ""Making Da Band"" where Dave makes fun of P. Diddy's MTV series; ""Negrodamus"" where Paul Mooney returns; an entire episode where Dave quits and is replaced by Wayne Brady; and the ""Racial Draft"" in the first episode, which explains itself well. Plus, the extra features are excellent, with nearly a half-hour of stand-up comedy from Dave, plenty of bloopers, two more ""Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories""--though not done nearly as well--and an the entire interview with the late Rick James. Those special features, along with the episodes and a few commentary tracks, make this a great package deal.Dave Chappelle is easily the funniest comedian out. He doesn't base his career off of corny one-liners (see Blue Collar Comedy) and doesn't mind being offensive. Basically, if you're offended by what he says or does in his series, then don't watch this, and definitely don't buy it. If you don't take yourself so seriously, and can see that Dave also makes fun of himself in this show, then pick this up.",5,"""I'm Rick James B****""",1138060800,"01 24, 2006",2006,2358,"['Season', 'two', 'Chappelle', 'Show', ""n't"", 'best', 'overall', 'season', 'Season', 'one', 'still', 'better', 'collection', 'episodes', 'still', 'introduced', 'lot', 'Chappelle', 'best', 'characters', 'season', 'two', 'three', 'very', 'important', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'season', 'one', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'True', 'Hollywood', 'Stories', 'Dave', 'Lil', 'Jon', 'Know', 'Black', 'People', 'Firstly', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'stories', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'fourth', 'episode', 'get', 'see', 'Rick', 'James', 'story', 'complete', 'Rick', 'James', 'there', 'prove', 'story', 'true', 'funniest', 'skit', 'seasons', 'fact', 'now', 'can', 'hear', 'everyone', 'today', 'going', 'shouting', 'catchphrase', 'heard', 'episode', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'also', 'Prince', 'few', 'extra', 'moments', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'Rick', 'James', 'episode', 'Dave', 'Lil', 'Jon', 'spawned', 'four', 'five', 'more', 'catchphrases', 'Know', 'Black', 'People', 'out', 'real', 'game', 'show', 'where', 'Dave', 'questions', 'dealing', 'black', 'people', 'rap', 'other', 'subject', 'closely', 'related', 'two', 'are', 'varied', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'hip', 'subjects', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'should', 'know', 'nothing', 'funny', 'thing', 'game', 'show', 'who', 'up', 'winning', 'also', 'answers', 'given', 'Dave', 'questions.Other', 'good', 'skits', 'include', 'Making', 'Da', 'Band', 'where', 'Dave', 'fun', 'P.', 'Diddy', 'MTV', 'series', 'Negrodamus', 'where', 'Paul', 'Mooney', 'entire', 'episode', 'where', 'Dave', 'quits', 'replaced', 'Wayne', 'Brady', 'Racial', 'Draft', 'first', 'episode', 'well', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'excellent', 'nearly', 'half-hour', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'Dave', 'plenty', 'bloopers', 'two', 'more', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'True', 'Hollywood', 'Stories', 'not', 'done', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'entire', 'interview', 'late', 'Rick', 'James', 'special', 'features', 'episodes', 'few', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'make', 'great', 'package', 'deal.Dave', 'Chappelle', 'easily', 'funniest', 'comedian', 'out', ""n't"", 'base', 'career', 'corny', 'one-liners', 'see', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Comedy', ""n't"", 'mind', 'being', 'offensive', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'offended', 'what', 'series', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'so', 'seriously', 'can', 'see', 'Dave', 'also', 'fun', 'show', 'then', 'pick', 'up']",N/A

JUST A THEORY.Wow, the skits are hilarious. I never thought I would see this type of comedy on T.V. again or ever again, but we did and they're funny. But, it seemed, (to me at least) that the skits were fewer and far between in the second season. Instead in their place, there were more musical acts, more rapping and more TALKING about stuff.  Weird things... that weren't funny, but talking about how the world puts the blacks down. Meanwhile, blacks, whites, yellows, reds and every other race was pouring money toward the show and its DVDs.Was Dave Chappelle's show hijacked by a bunch of people who saw an opportunity to voice their oppression? That's what I think. The comedy was less and the complaining was increased.That, to me, ain't funny.Either way, season 2 was less comedy, less funny and I couldn't help while I was watching it, to think that I wish I had my own editor and could have edited all those weird moments where Dave Chappelle was pushed to the background and the comedy was replaced with uncomfortable negativity.Or maybe Dave Chappelle wanted all that stuff to be in it to use his show as a forum to voice his oppression and the network and companies producing the show told him to change it and he didn't like it, so he left.I guess that could have happened too.And if that's what happened, the Chappelle needed only to look at his overflowing pockets and quit complaining.Whether Chappelle or the people who hijacked his show are feeling oppressed or not, or if they are, doesn't matter... it's a comedy show... and people don't tune into a comedy show to hear that junk and feel all negative. They want to laugh.So, if you wanna use your show to stress your feelings about oppression... then do it in the realm of comedy.I'm sorry, but being a huge fan of season 1, and buying season 2 as soon as it came out, I was shocked at how the show had changed and how unimpressed I was.

Hustwick,"[3, 4]","This guy is so freakin hilarious -- he knows just how to cut something down to size -- never pandering, never cloying, never trying too hard to get a laugh.Chapelle is totally gutsy and that's what makes him great. My only bone to pick is that his racially charged sketches frequently walk the line between pointing out hypocrisy and bull**** and become genuinely offensive. He uses the ""N"" word SO MUCH, and it is the basis of too many of his punchlines. Eventually, it seems like kind of a cheap excuse for comedy. He just doesn't have to do it -- the Rick James sketches are some of the best of the entire season, and they have virtually nothing to do with racial undertones. I think you are treading on pretty thin ice when you start dressing up as a slave, pretend to be whipped, etc. And using the ""N"" word SO MUCH really does become something pretty twisted. I mean, if a caucasian accidentally says this EVER, much less in public...it's all over. And if that's Chapelle's way of being patronizing, I suppose it's his perogative but seems beneath his enormous talents.Another thing Dave does repeatedly is come up with a clever framing device that thinly veils some seriously offensive material. In the first season, it was the blind African-American racist -- which was obviously a character concocted out of necessity for Chapelle's own riffs on white supremacists. Now he gets away using the ""N"" racial slur about 100 times by saying against white people. That supposedly makes it less offensive, see. Oh, and violently urinating in a females prosecutor's face gets swept under the carpet as ""video technology."" Dave is very clever at sliding his racial slurs under the near-impenetrable shield of comedic liscense. And don't get me started on the MTV Real World episode with the African American stealing the white dud'e girl and then fornicating with her while fat white boy watches. Can you IMAGINE what the reaction would be if the races were reversed in that situation?",5,Dave is Hilarious.

Well, there is good reason for that pixelation...the pixelation is to give the viewer the idea that there were bare breasts there when there really was not...they were really covered up! If you watch the ""outtakes/blooper"" reel, you'll see clearly (and UN-pixelated) that the women at the bar have dark covers over their breasts, but the pixelation made them look bare.Had they not had these covers on, this DVD would NOT have censored it. And ask yourself why they pixelated that when, during the Oprah sequence, Dave was painting a VERY NAKED woman who was NOT pixelated at all...and was 100% in the buff. Think about it!It's really a shame when reviews have to resort to something like this, but I felt I owed it to Dave, Neal and their genius comedic talents to let everyone know what they were complaining about was really absolutely nothing!

871957,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B0006Q93CO,Dorrie Wheeler,"[1, 1]","This really was a hilarious season.  It seems like the mass media really picked up on the Rick James and Lil Jon skits from the second season.  Although, these skits were funny (Rick James more than the Lil Jon), the season was so much more than these two skits.  One of the funniest skits of the season was the Wayne Brady episode when Wayne hosted Dave's show and then took him on a wild ride.  Their were a lot of other funny skits like the puppets, Making The Band (when Dave did his best Puff Daddy), and the skit Keeping It Real.  Another funny skit from this season is the Prince skit.The DVD includes all of the episodes from the second season.  All of the episodes were funny, with the exception of episode 12 I believe.  The episode in which they highlight skits that never aired, like the Sally Jesse skit when Dave comes in took discipline some kids as Nelson Mandela, that episode was a little bit slow.The bonus disc is worth taking a look at.  In the bloopers and deleted scenes you can catch extra footage from some of the popular skits from the season.  At times during these bloopers Dave can be heard saying some choice things.  Before the ""Black Gallagher"" skit he says, ""this is so ridiculous,"" minus expletive and during an office scene blooper for ""Keepin It real"" he can be heard saying, ""I can't stop laughing at myself, in Hollywood this is what we call a bad actor.""  In another skit outtake, he has to call a woman a B to her face and no matter how many times he trys he can't get it right.  These little moments make the viewer wonder if Dave was growing tired of yelling expletives and acting so foolish to make us laugh.  In the episode in which he quits Comedy Central and leaves the show it makes one wonder if Dave was fed up with the show in real life since he has yet to complete Season 3.The bonus Charlie Murphy True Hollywood Stories are kind of snoozers.  The one about his brother is just basicallly Charlie talking about how he used to work security for his brother.  The best Charlie Murphy feature on the bonus disc is the extended Rick James memories.  He tells a lot of other funny stories about Rick and it's real funny.Overall, I am truly pleased.

Monty Python is my favorite, and still unsurpassed in sketch comedy.  Another one is the early years of SNL.  I also love The Two Ronnies.  The other brilliant sketch show is this one, Chappelle's Show.  Even though there were only 2 seasons (the ""lost episodes"" don't really count, as Dave didn't want them released), they were some of the funniest sketch stuff that I've ever seen, where I was literally rolling in the aisles and had to pause for a few minutes because I was dying of laughter.  Chappelle has that unspoken quality, that aura if you will, that many artists/performers have.  You're just born with that.  And his stuff is absolutely hilarious.  I love many sketches here, like the ""when keepin' it real goes wrong"" sketch, the ""three Daves"" sketch, the white supremacist sketch, Tyrone the crack guy, Little Jim, and, of course, the Rick James sketch.  There's a few clunkers here and there (mostly black Gallagher and Samuel Jackson's beer), but there are incredibly minor complaints when you look at how brilliant the rest of the material is.  Perhaps Dave was right to cut off the series before he started repeating himself.  Who knows?

The ""Racial Draft"" cuts across racial lines in an amusing farce of inter-racial celebrities.  Then there are ""The Time Haters"" who go back to the antebellum days of America to free the slaves, and his side-splitting spoof on ""Samuel Jackson"" beer.

The envelope is pushed even further as only Dave can do it, and now it can be remembered in a great dvd set. This 3-disc set is packed with more extras than season 1 and for $20 it was more than worth it. So many memorable skits came from this season, and of course the most popular one seems to be the Rick James skit. Somebody says Chappelle and another person will usually yell out ""I'm Rick James, b****"" every time. This season had so many other highlights though. Black Gallagher, Samuel Jackson beer, and Making the band  were some of my favorites. Also the Wayne Brady skit where Wayne asks ""Is Wayne Brady gonna have to slap a b****?"" kills me every time. What makes them so funny is the fact that Dave is dead-on in his impressions of P. Diddy, Rick James, Prince and Gallagher. It really is intelligent comedy by one of the funniest men alive today.There are some thoughtless complaints about the title ""uncensored"". The two chicks in the Rick James skit are still blurred out on the dvd. Did anyone ever think that they didn't give permission to show their breasts? In the bloopers they are unblurred but using body paint to partially cover them up. Sounds to me like they didn't want them to be shown. Anyone complaining about that and giving the set 2-3 stars is an idiot. There are plenty of places in real life and internet to see what you want to see.This set contains all episodes from the second season uncensored, and it truly is uncensored aside from the Rick James skit. It is so much better than watching the bleeped versions on tv. Disk 3 is loaded with great stuff, from commentaries by Chappelle and co-creator Neal Brennen, bloopers and outakes on many of the episodes, 2 unaired Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories, extended Rick James interview and even some bonus stand-up on the show from Chappelle.

After Season 2's fourth episode aired, you couldn't escape ""I'm Rick James, bitch!""; everyone was saying it---proof that the show was becoming a cultural phenomenon.I first discovered ""Chappelle's Show"" just before Season 2 began, via reruns of certain Season 1 episodes. Dave Chappelle's racially-slanted takeoff of ""Real World"" was one of the funniest sketches I have seen, an inspired short piece which re-imagined the MTV show with a poor chubby white guy surrounded by crazy black characters. It satirized nearly every possible stereotype of blacks in today's society, and exaggerated them to hilarious effect. As Tyrone Biggums said about crack, ""It's great.""For me, very few of the sketches in Season 2 really approached the glorious high of that sketch. Throughout the season's 13 episodes, I kept waiting for something to really make me bust my gut with laughter, and it rarely occurred for me. I guess I'm mostly speaking on a visceral level; I'm not denying the intelligence and social satire underlying some of the season's sketches. But after some of the brilliantly funny sketches of Season 1, most of Season 2 seemed, to me, a letdown---not a massive disappointment, just a letdown.My problems with Season 2 are, I suppose, mostly personal---some sketches went irredeemably over-the-top with vulgarity, for instance, while others relied a bit too much on references to previous ""Chappelle's Show"" jokes. But, as the season went along, I started to feel a little uneasy at some of the attitudes Dave Chappelle was passing off as ""edgy comedy.""One look at a sketch in Episode 9, and perhaps you might see what I mean. The sketch in question is one in which Chappelle simulates his involvement in certain jury selections. The joke, of course, is that Chappelle is much more willing to excuse black people on trial than whites (Chappelle on Robert Blake: ""Oh yeah. Baretta did that s--t."") And I know, I'm supposed to find it amusing, the lengths Chappelle goes to try to excuse the actiosn of O.J. Simpson (""what black man don't got some bloody gloves on his property?""), Michael Jackson (""He made 'Thriller'...'Thriller'...""), and R. Kelly (""For all I know, that piss was digital...""). Still, I think the sketch highlights a faint (but, to me, unmistakable) strain of reverse racism that started to bother me as I watched some of the sketches of Season 2---a feeling that Chappelle was starting to (however unintentionally) support stereotypes rather than comically skewer them. I could excuse Season 1's ""The Mad Real World"" from such claims, since it was clearly meant to play with racial stereotypes in the context of a fantasy universe, and not necessarily meant to realistically satirize social reality. The real-life context of S2E9's sketch, though, made my view of it a little more complicated, to say the least. In the alternate universe of ""Chappelle's Show,"" it seems as if most blacks in it were comical drug addicts or gangsters, and most whites (as well as Tiger Woods) were stiffs (and even racist ones, as Episode 5's spoof of ""Law and Order"" implies). Of course, such stereotypes are the main fount of humor that Chappelle and (white) co-writer Neal Brennan draw upon for their comedy. I guess that maybe, for me, the joke is starting to get a little stale. (Even Dave Chappelle may be starting to realize it, too; he suggested as much in that exclusive interview for TIME that he gave while still in hiding in South Africa recently.)Still, I don't want to sell this second season too short; Chappelle is too witty a comic to not come up with some good, enjoyable material here and there. Even when Chappelle isn't at the top of his game, he is often hilarious anyway simply for his delivery (without Chappelle's sheer energy level, Episode 13's ""Black Bush"" probably would have been boring, since it doesn't really add much to the anti-Bush table except Chappelle's own style). I'll give this Season 2 DVD set 4 stars because, while I don't think the episodes are consistently good, they often are, at the very least, consistently entertaining (and sometimes genuinely witty). I just don't think Season 2 is as memorable as Season 1, for some of the reasons I've outlined above.",4,"Still funny, but not as good as Season 1, to me",1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,4344,"['memorable', 'first', 'season', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'laid', 'groundwork', 'Season', '2', 'show', 'really', 'become', 'huge', 'popular', 'hit', 'Season', '2', 'fourth', 'episode', 'aired', 'could', ""n't"", 'escape', ""'m"", 'Rick', 'James', 'bitch', 'everyone', 'was', 'saying', 'show', 'was', 'becoming', 'cultural', 'phenomenon.I', 'first', 'discovered', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'just', 'Season', '2', 'began', 'reruns', 'certain', 'Season', '1', 'episodes', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'racially-slanted', 'takeoff', 'Real', 'World', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'sketches', 'have', 'seen', 'inspired', 'short', 'piece', 're-imagined', 'MTV', 'show', 'poor', 'chubby', 'white', 'guy', 'surrounded', 'crazy', 'black', 'characters', 'satirized', 'nearly', 'possible', 'stereotype', 'blacks', 'today', 'society', 'exaggerated', 'hilarious', 'effect', 'Tyrone', 'Biggums', 'said', 'crack', 'great', 'very', 'few', 'sketches', 'Season', '2', 'really', 'approached', 'glorious', 'high', 'sketch', 'season', '13', 'episodes', 'kept', 'waiting', 'something', 'really', 'make', 'bust', 'gut', 'laughter', 'rarely', 'occurred', 'guess', ""'m"", 'mostly', 'speaking', 'visceral', 'level', ""'m"", 'not', 'denying', 'intelligence', 'social', 'satire', 'underlying', 'season', 'sketches', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'sketches', 'Season', '1', 'most', 'Season', '2', 'seemed', 'letdown', 'massive', 'disappointment', 'just', 'letdown.My', 'problems', 'Season', '2', 'are', 'suppose', 'mostly', 'personal', '-some', 'sketches', 'went', 'irredeemably', 'over-the-top', 'vulgarity', 'instance', 'others', 'relied', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'references', 'previous', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'jokes', 'season', 'went', 'started', 'feel', 'little', 'uneasy', 'attitudes', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'was', 'passing', 'off', 'edgy', 'comedy', 'One', 'look', 'sketch', 'Episode', '9', 'perhaps', 'might', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'sketch', 'question', 'one', 'Chappelle', 'involvement', 'certain', 'jury', 'selections', 'joke', 'course', 'Chappelle', 'much', 'more', 'willing', 'excuse', 'black', 'people', 'trial', 'whites', 'Chappelle', 'Robert', 'Blake', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Baretta', 'did', 's', 't.', 'know', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'find', 'amusing', 'lengths', 'Chappelle', 'try', 'excuse', 'actiosn', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'what', 'black', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'got', 'bloody', 'gloves', 'property', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'made', ""'Thriller"", ""'Thriller"", 'R.', 'Kelly', 'know', 'piss', 'was', 'digital', 'Still', 'think', 'sketch', 'faint', 'unmistakable', 'strain', 'reverse', 'racism', 'started', 'bother', 'watched', 'sketches', 'Season', '2', '-a', 'feeling', 'Chappelle', 'was', 'starting', 'however', 'unintentionally', 'support', 'rather', 'comically', 'skewer', 'could', 'excuse', 'Season', '1', 'Mad', 'Real', 'World', 'such', 'claims', 'was', 'clearly', 'meant', 'play', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'context', 'fantasy', 'universe', 'not', 'necessarily', 'meant', 'realistically', 'satirize', 'social', 'reality', 'real-life', 'context', 'S2E9', 'sketch', 'made', 'view', 'little', 'more', 'complicated', 'say', 'least', 'alternate', 'universe', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'most', 'blacks', 'were', 'comical', 'drug', 'addicts', 'gangsters', 'most', 'whites', 'as', 'well', 'Tiger', 'Woods', 'were', 'stiffs', 'even', 'racist', 'ones', 'Episode', '5', 'spoof', 'Law', 'Order', 'implies', 'course', 'such', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'main', 'fount', 'humor', 'Chappelle', 'white', 'co-writer', 'Neal', 'Brennan', 'comedy', 'guess', 'maybe', 'joke', 'starting', 'get', 'little', 'stale', 'Even', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'may', 'be', 'starting', 'realize', 'too', 'suggested', 'as', 'much', 'exclusive', 'interview', 'TIME', 'gave', 'while', 'still', 'hiding', 'South', 'Africa', 'recently', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'sell', 'second', 'season', 'too', 'short', 'Chappelle', 'too', 'witty', 'comic', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'material', 'here', 'there', 'Even', 'when', 'Chappelle', ""n't"", 'top', 'game', 'often', 'hilarious', 'anyway', 'simply', 'delivery', 'Chappelle', 'sheer', 'energy', 'level', 'Episode', '13', 'Black', 'Bush', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'boring', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'much', 'anti-Bush', 'table', 'Chappelle', 'own', 'style', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'set', '4', 'stars', 'because', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'episodes', 'are', 'consistently', 'good', 'often', 'are', 'very', 'least', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'sometimes', 'genuinely', 'witty', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Season', '2', 'as', 'memorable', 'Season', '1', 'reasons', ""'ve"", 'outlined']",N/A

872006,A194GQYVY9HXUP,B0006Q93CO,Ray-Review,"[3, 4]","Some people may dissagree with me but Dave Chappelle is the funniest man that has ever been on stand-up. Yeah he has been in a couple of law suits because of this show, because he was accused of bein a racist and many things which made him so controversal. But if u think about all of the things he says and does is all based on what he has heard of from other people. For an example black people like fried chicken, that may or may not be true but he was not the one who created that. The thing that makes him so damn funny is the way he tells his jokes, he is so outragous and goes so far that other people hasn't done yet which makes him an original. But enough with that s*** I would Like to tell you the good and the bad about this DVD.First the bad, I really had nothing wrong with the show itself but the fact there is only 13 episodes really pissed me off. I mean u could finish this dvd less then 6 hours and I was expecting at least 20 episodes, but other then the size of the dvd thats about all thats wrong with it. NOW the good, everything he did during the second season is extremly funny and I meanlaugh until it hurts funny. The things I like the most I will list.1)The Racial Draft episode- It was hella funny when Colin Powell and Condeleazer Rice was picked by the white delegation and the funniest sh** when Wu-Tang turned chinese.2)Wayne Brady take over- the last skit of that episode was so funny I cryed, it shows a different side of Wayne, if u have seen him on Whose Line is it Anyway? then this will be new to you. cuz he acts the way a ghetto person would act - hoes, cussin, drugs, and drive-bys wayne brady was hilarious.3)Charlie Murphys True Hollywood Stories- Starring Dave Chappelle as The superstar rick james and Prince. this particular skit was the main reason I bought this It was probably the only one I watched over & over again. I'm Rick James B****.4)The Extras was okay just showed extra stand-ups that Dave Chappele did plus an hour of outakes that were pretty funny except the only thing I didn't like was the 4osumthin takes of Charlie Murphy laughing the same exact laugh. I just didn't get that.5) Season 2 completly surpasses season 1 in every way so get up out yo ass and end this review by buying this DVD.

Wayne Brady - When Brady said, ""Is Wayne Brady gonna have to slap a (expletive deleted)?"" it had me on the floor for days.4. When Keeping it Real Goes Wrong - Keep it real is a phrase that has annoyed me for a while so these skits were always good for a laugh especially the one with the girl.3. Black Bush - A rare political statement from Chappelle with great takes from Mos Def as Black Ashcroft, Charlie Murphy as Black Rumsfeld and Jamie Foxx as Black Tony Blair. Check out the deleted scenes for Black Jeb Bush explaining the Florida recounts.2. Kneehigh Park - How can you go wrong with Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest, Snoop Dogg as a puppet and a bunch of little VD puppets? I just hope that they overdubbed the lines so the kids there didn't actually hear any of it.1. Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories - This one is a no brainer with the duel blast of Rick James and Prince. I remember reading Prince said he's constantly getting challenged to play basketball, although he never mentioned whether it actually happened or not. And it is very hard to go a day without hearing someone say, ""I'm Rick James...""This DVD does have most of the musical performances unlike the first season so we get great performances from the likes of Anthony Hamilton, Common, Kanye West (three times), Mos Def, Wyclef Jean, Snoop Dogg, and a special performance from John Mayer and ?uestlove doing a few 80's TV theme songs. I'm a huge John Mayer and The Roots fan so the skit was great to see them perform together (a side note, ?uestlove played drums on Mayer's Clarity).As for extras on the DVD, we get the standard audio commentary by Chappelle and co-creator, Neal Brennan for five episodes. We also get about an hour and a half of deleted scenes and blooper, including twenty-three takes of Charlie Murphy laughing at Prince's challenge. But the highlights of the extra a two unaired storied by Charlie Murphy. One of which I can't believe they didn't turn into a sketch because it could have been as funny as Rick James or Prince. Then there is the extended interview of Rick James that they used for that episode. His imitation of Charlie Murphy had me on the floor.

872025,A1A2SWJHNJ10FP,B0006Q93CO,"Troy Kearney ""avid reader""","[1, 2]","Chappelle's Show became Comedy Central's breakthrough hit show in 2003, giving the network its hottest program to date.  Of course it would lead to the release of Season 1 on DVD and thusly lead to the biggest-selling DVD collection of a TV series in history with nearly 3 million copies sold and counting (currently beating out the Family Guy DVD collections).  So how do you match that?The answer is you follow up your hit season with an even bigger second season and that is what viewers get with Chappelle's Show Season 2: Uncensored.  The newest volume of the series contains all 13 episodes of the smashing 2nd season of Chappelle's Show, including the episodes and various sketches that have made the show explode into a cult phenomenon.The first of the classic episodes deals with Charlie Murphy (Eddie's brother) and his ""True Hollywood Stories"" involving funk superstar Rick James, who also appears in the story to seemingly corroborate (or at times disprove) Charlie's statements. Additionally, James is portrayed hilariously in flashbacks by Dave Chappelle and if you can't laugh at his performance you need a serious laughter transfusion.  As we all know this led to the creation of one of the most quoted, or paraphrased, phrases of last and this year: ""I'm Rick James, b---h!""Another episode is a second edition of ""THS"" that has Charlie meeting up with another funk legend, Prince (again played up for laughs in flashbacks by Chappelle),who along with his band The Revolution challenges Charlie and his friends to a basketball game after a listening party.  This is one of the funnest sketches of the entire 2nd season and worth getting the set.Several sketches over the series run have Dave playing the self-proclaimed ""King of Crunk"", Lil Jon and seemingly reducing the rapper/producer's vocabulary to the 3 most well-known words he says: Yeah!, What? and Okay!, and making him seem like a seriously intellingent man (which he is in real life)at times (so much so the real Lil Jon appears in one sketch).But without question the one episode the takes the prize in the collection is when Dave abruptly quits the show and is ultimately replaced by...Wayne Brady?!?!  The fact that Brady plays so far against the normally typecast ""goody-two-shoes"" way that he normally acts is a howler, especially when he says ""Does Wayne Brady need to choke a b---h around here?""  That line alone make the episode a classic.Unlike the Season 1 set which was made up of 2 discs, the Season 2 set has 3 discs, the episodes are on discs 1 and 2 including audio commentary from Dave and his partner/co-creator Neal Brennan on selected episodes, but the 3rd disc contains all the bonus features to include: an additional stand-up from Dave, over an hour of deleted/extended scenes and bloopers with commentary, an extended interview with Rick James, 2 unaired Charile Murphy stories, and more.  The one thing that might burn some viewers is that in the Rick James episode, a scene where two women show ""Rick"" (Dave) their breasts is still blurred in the episode.  Never fear though: The scene is located in the Deleted Scenes without blurring and (believe it or not) shows a rather unique way to use chocolate...:)This is definitely for those Chappelle's Show fans that loved the first season and need something to tide them over until the 3rd season FINALLY gets completed or just for those that always wonder why someone is consistently walking around saying ""I'm Rick James, b---h!"" and have no clue why.  This will definitely prove that some things are funner the second time around...",4,The funniest show on TV gets even more funnier in Season 2,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,3585,"['Chappelle', 'Show', 'became', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'breakthrough', 'hit', 'show', '2003', 'giving', 'network', 'hottest', 'program', 'date', 'course', 'would', 'lead', 'release', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'thusly', 'lead', 'biggest-selling', 'DVD', 'collection', 'TV', 'series', 'history', 'nearly', '3', 'million', 'copies', 'sold', 'counting', 'currently', 'beating', 'out', 'Family', 'Guy', 'DVD', 'collections', 'So', 'how', 'do', 'match', 'answer', 'follow', 'up', 'hit', 'season', 'even', 'bigger', 'second', 'season', 'what', 'viewers', 'get', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'Season', '2', 'Uncensored', 'newest', 'volume', 'series', '13', 'episodes', 'smashing', '2nd', 'season', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'including', 'episodes', 'various', 'sketches', 'have', 'made', 'show', 'cult', 'phenomenon.The', 'first', 'classic', 'episodes', 'deals', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'Eddie', 'brother', 'True', 'Hollywood', 'Stories', 'involving', 'funk', 'superstar', 'Rick', 'James', 'who', 'also', 'story', 'seemingly', 'corroborate', 'times', 'disprove', 'Charlie', 'statements', 'Additionally', 'James', 'portrayed', 'hilariously', 'flashbacks', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'performance', 'need', 'serious', 'laughter', 'transfusion', 'know', 'led', 'creation', 'one', 'most', 'quoted', 'paraphrased', 'phrases', 'last', 'year', ""'m"", 'Rick', 'James', 'b', '-h', 'episode', 'second', 'edition', 'THS', 'Charlie', 'meeting', 'up', 'funk', 'legend', 'Prince', 'again', 'played', 'up', 'laughs', 'flashbacks', 'Chappelle', 'who', 'band', 'Revolution', 'Charlie', 'friends', 'basketball', 'game', 'listening', 'party', 'one', 'funnest', 'sketches', 'entire', '2nd', 'season', 'worth', 'getting', 'set.Several', 'sketches', 'series', 'run', 'have', 'Dave', 'playing', 'self-proclaimed', 'King', 'Crunk', 'Lil', 'Jon', 'seemingly', 'reducing', 'rapper/producer', 'vocabulary', '3', 'most', 'well-known', 'words', 'Yeah', 'What', 'Okay', 'making', 'seem', 'seriously', 'intellingent', 'man', 'real', 'life', 'times', 'so', 'much', 'real', 'Lil', 'Jon', 'one', 'sketch', 'question', 'one', 'episode', 'prize', 'collection', 'when', 'Dave', 'abruptly', 'show', 'ultimately', 'replaced', 'Wayne', 'Brady', 'fact', 'Brady', 'so', 'far', 'normally', 'typecast', 'goody-two-shoes', 'way', 'normally', 'howler', 'especially', 'when', 'Does', 'Wayne', 'Brady', 'need', 'choke', 'b', '-h', 'here', 'line', 'alone', 'make', 'episode', 'classic.Unlike', 'Season', '1', 'set', 'was', 'made', '2', 'discs', 'Season', '2', 'set', '3', 'discs', 'episodes', 'are', 'discs', '1', '2', 'including', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Dave', 'partner/co-creator', 'Neal', 'Brennan', 'selected', 'episodes', '3rd', 'disc', 'contains', 'bonus', 'include', 'additional', 'stand-up', 'Dave', 'hour', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'commentary', 'extended', 'interview', 'Rick', 'James', '2', 'unaired', 'Charile', 'Murphy', 'stories', 'more', 'one', 'thing', 'might', 'burn', 'viewers', 'Rick', 'James', 'episode', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'women', 'show', 'Rick', 'Dave', 'breasts', 'still', 'blurred', 'episode', 'fear', 'scene', 'located', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'blurring', 'believe', 'not', 'rather', 'unique', 'way', 'use', 'chocolate', 'definitely', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'need', 'something', 'tide', 'over', '3rd', 'season', 'FINALLY', 'completed', 'just', 'always', 'wonder', 'why', 'someone', 'consistently', 'walking', 'around', 'saying', ""'m"", 'Rick', 'James', 'b', '-h', 'have', 'clue', 'why', 'will', 'definitely', 'prove', 'things', 'are', 'funner', 'second', 'time']",N/A

(Now I cleverly altered the real titles in order to protect the shows that the few who will want them already have or will shortly get anyway.  Here's a hint to the producers of these shows as it worked for me:  Word of mouth does far better than forcing adverts down our throats or other areas.)(this is more of an industry gripe)  We didn't get forced commercials before for other DVD releases, and this new trend is disturbing.  Especially when prices haven't dropped one penny.  Where's the trade-off?Okay, that's really 5 minutes/20 seconds of pointless adverts (I ain't buyin') plus 1 minute 30 seconds of the omnipresent FBI warnings.As for the show itself, some music videos are removed.  Fans will not be pleased by this, especially when they had to sit through 6 minutes of promos (and a minute of FBI jargon) just to get to the menu.

I was waiting for this release for MONTHS as it kept getting pushed forward.

(yeah, this part sounds lame but how would you feel after sitting through, you guessed it, 6 minutes of commercials plus an FBI warning that every DVD owner sees on every DVD.  If you own 200 DVDs, you've seen this advert at least 200 times.
