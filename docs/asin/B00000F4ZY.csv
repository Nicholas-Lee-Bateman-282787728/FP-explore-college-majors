The ending with him jousting without armour and strapping the lance to his arm is just silly. The movie is modern in every sense of the word and that is it's greatest failing. As much as I like the music on it's own it fails to inspire in a story about jousting. There is an MTV mentality that prevails throughout the film. It is a big disappointment. It's strongest element is the characters as most are likeable and interesting. It tries hard to be fun and fantasy, but it's modern influences are so heavy and overdone that it is difficult to appreciate the rest. It is no Excalibure or Ivanhoe.",3,It's called a lance... hello,1001462400,"09 26, 2001",2001,668,"['movie', 'had', 'alot', 'going', 'really', 'fell', 'short', 'end', 'ending', 'jousting', 'armour', 'strapping', 'lance', 'arm', 'just', 'silly', 'movie', 'modern', 'sense', 'word', 'greatest', 'failing', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'music', 'own', 'inspire', 'story', 'jousting', 'MTV', 'mentality', 'film', 'big', 'disappointment', 'strongest', 'element', 'characters', 'most', 'are', 'likeable', 'interesting', 'hard', 'be', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'modern', 'influences', 'are', 'so', 'heavy', 'overdone', 'difficult', 'appreciate', 'rest', 'Excalibure', 'Ivanhoe']",A Knight's Tale

The film effectively merges multiple genres, and in turn audiences are treated to a wonderfully witty, rock-god-esque romp through time, with a dash of medieval chivalry thrown in for good measure.

No performances leap out as great, with the exception of Paul Bettany (the saving grace of A Beautiful Mind), who played Chaucer. That was a great touch.

498631,A24YME33WJ71LY,B00000F4ZY,AJ Starling,"[1, 4]","Although not an Oscar level film, this is a fun movie and is worth adding to your collection.  It starts of fun and keeps getting better as the movie continues.  Heath Ledger gives a good performance, and Rufus Sewell is the knight you'll love to hate.  Everyone in the supporting cast does a superb job as well, and they were really a good match for each other.  ""A Knight's Tale"" has a great soundtrack (that's more than a little out of time) and spectacular jousting matches, but also is a wonderful story.  The movie really has it all:  humor, romance, battle (jousting anyway), beautiful scenery, excellent camera work, and hot tunes.The movie is about a young squire from old England named William.  The knight that he and his friends have been following most of their lives dies during a jousting competition, and in order to win the trophy (so they can eat), William dons the armor and mask (thus breaking the rule of only the nobility may joust) and wins the match.  Charged by this victory, the trio elects to continue the charade and William becomes Sir Ulrich.  Now they must travel and compete, all the while trying to conceal the truth as Ulrich vies to win the heart of his sweet Jocelyn (who his nemesis Count Adhemar vows to steal from him).The DVD features are excellent also, if that's something you're interested in.  The commentary is done by Brian Helgeland (director) and Paul Bettany (Geoff) and I do recommend listening to it at least once.  Some deleted scenes are included, although they're not of high quality as far as the actual picture-quality goes.  Also included are a few ""making of"" featurettes that are worth watching if you care at all about cinematic production or if you just want to know how they did all that jousting without getting killed.  But this movie stands on its own without the added extras.Most important, if you have not seen it before, is to watch to the end of the credits.",4,Thoroughly enjoyable movie,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,1928,"['not', 'Oscar', 'level', 'film', 'fun', 'movie', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'fun', 'getting', 'better', 'movie', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'good', 'performance', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'knight', ""'ll"", 'love', 'hate', 'Everyone', 'supporting', 'cast', 'superb', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'match', 'other', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'more', 'little', 'time', 'spectacular', 'jousting', 'matches', 'also', 'wonderful', 'story', 'movie', 'really', 'humor', 'romance', 'battle', 'jousting', 'anyway', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'excellent', 'camera', 'work', 'hot', 'tunes.The', 'movie', 'young', 'squire', 'old', 'England', 'named', 'William', 'knight', 'friends', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'most', 'lives', 'dies', 'jousting', 'competition', 'order', 'win', 'trophy', 'can', 'eat', 'William', 'armor', 'mask', 'thus', 'breaking', 'rule', 'only', 'nobility', 'may', 'joust', 'match', 'Charged', 'victory', 'trio', 'continue', 'charade', 'William', 'Sir', 'Ulrich', 'Now', 'must', 'travel', 'compete', 'while', 'trying', 'conceal', 'truth', 'Ulrich', 'win', 'heart', 'sweet', 'Jocelyn', 'who', 'nemesis', 'Count', 'Adhemar', 'steal', '.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'excellent', 'also', 'something', ""'re"", 'interested', 'commentary', 'done', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'director', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Geoff', 'do', 'recommend', 'listening', 'least', 'once', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', ""'re"", 'not', 'high', 'quality', 'as', 'far', 'actual', 'picture-quality', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'few', 'making', 'featurettes', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'care', 'cinematic', 'production', 'just', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'did', 'jousting', 'getting', 'killed', 'movie', 'own', 'added', 'extras.Most', 'important', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'watch', 'end', 'credits']",A Knight's Tale

498633,A1A4DEENGHK51T,B00000F4ZY,Alan Attebery,"[5, 6]","Imagine..... it is the 1370s, and jousting is the most popular sport around. The knights are making their way onto the field, riding high on top of their steeds, looking at the arena full of people, both peasants and royalty, singing and clapping their hands to Queen's &quot;We Will Rock You.&quot;Say what??????????For most people, they will either love or hate this movie based on the first ten minutes, which contains the aformentioned rock anthem. If you do decide to brave this weirdness, you will be treated to a movie that is much better than the burning that many critics gave it.Heath Ledger stars as William Thatcher, a peasant whose dreams are much, much bigger than he is. But Williams won't let that stop him. The first chance he gets, he impersonates a knight by pretending that he is descended from royalty. Since peasants are not allowed to joust, he must continue his act no matter what. Even if that means lying to the one he loves.The casting of this movie was brillant, but none more so than casting Paul Bettany as Geoffrey Chaucer (see one of the extras on the history behind bringing this real life writer into the movie as one of the characters). Shannyn Sossamon, making her acting debut as Jocelyn, the object of Thatcher's love, makes her presence known with every move, word, and stare. You will quickly see why Thatcher is in love with her.This is not a movie that you can see once and pretend to understand.

498634,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00000F4ZY,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[3, 3]","* NOTE:  This review, filed February 6, 2008, is a substantial reworking of my first Amazon review filed January 18, 2006, following the film's first release in standard DVD.  What follows is a substantial reworking of the 2006 review to fit the new conditions of the film's release in Blu-Ray format.  The caption is new, too, formerly THE CRITICS UNFAIRLY RAZZED THIS ONE.The tragic death of Heath Ledger by accidental drug overdose in January 2008 has resulted in an irony: a cruel one, but one which rebounds for people who are interested in Ledger's early career. So many of his many movies are available now, this release in Blu-Ray, and so many show him to be the stellar actor he was.  This is one of them.A KNIGHT'S TALE (2001) is a deliberately anachronistic farce: Medieval and Modern, Savage and Satiric, (maybe we should call them ""Swords and Synthesizers?"") The tone of Middle Ages naturalism/bled thru with modern gonzo absurdity results in an enjoyable, if somewhat high-concept, comedy along the lines of ELLA ENCHANTED, but for slightly older audiences.  Early in the film, the amped-up strains of QUEEN's ""We Will Rock You"" comes on the soundtrack -- an indicator that A KNIGHT'S TALE strives to be funny: and it succeeds -- but only, as some other reviewers have written, ""if you don't take it too seriously."" The movie is laced with other enjoyable pop songs from our not-too-recent past, crowd-pleasers to fit the theme that sometimes ironically comment on the action, and sometimes support it.Essentially, films like A KNIGHT'S TALE, MOULIN ROUGE and the remarkably successful ELLA ENCHANTED have become the new Anglo-American movie musical. The characters don't burst into song, like SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, nor do they even warble as in a more naturalistic ""backstage"" setting like CABARET. In A KNIGHT'S TALE, the soundtrack itself is one of the stars. The story of a poor boy from Cheapside, London, whose father gives him to a wandering knight for training, is an up-with-your-bootstraps story in the vein of ROCKY or ALL THE RIGHT MOVES, but with an attitude more like ""Fractured Fairy Tales.""  What other film but this one introduces a major character in the (posterior) nude--an itinerant poet named Geoff Chaucer?The writing's good, the plot has just enough turns to remain interesting, and you couldn't ask for a better cast than Heath Ledger and company. If you're looking for a fun Medieval comedy-drama, somewhat in the vein of ELLA ENCHANTED but a little more mature, go for A KNIGHT'S TALE. Yes, it was done in 2001 and early in the Anglo/American component of Heath Ledger's filmography.  However, IMHO his acting skills and ability to disappear into a role are quite in evidence here. Recommended as a family flick, especially for people who like modern pop music, Ledger the actor himself, or medieval spoof a la MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL.Nearly seven years ago, when A KNIGHT'S TALE first played in cinemas, more than a few well-seasoned professional critics panned this -- unfairly, IMO. Perhaps they hadn't yet become acclimated to this type of ancahronistic farce?But that was then and this is now.  A KNIGHT'S TALE works!

It had everything that I wanted when I originally saw it in the theatres and now that I have it on DVD I couldn't be more pleased. First of all, I want to inform you that I'm the 256th Five Star reviewer and the 525th person overall to review this magnificent movie.William Thatcher (Descendant Of Margaret Thatcher?) is a squire who takes advantage of a situation that presents itself to him. When his lord dies of a heart attack he decides to use his armor and cop his Identity in a jousting tournament. He wins the tournament and with the prize money decides with his friends to continue jousting in the guise of Ulrich von Liechenstein. Along the way he encounters Jeffrey Chaucer, a writer and poet who is able to create the forged documents that legitimize his identity. They meet an ironsmith named Kate Farris, a woman who is the best at her trade yet is discriminated against because of her gender. Along with Roland and Wat (The Original Squires), they form a companionship that endures through good times and bad times.I liked the themes of this movie (Not The Song Thems Though). A humble man who rises above his station and defeats the wealthy arrogant noble while along the way becomes friends with men in high places and meets and charms a beautiful woman who in turn loves him through thick and thin! This is every guys dream.A Knight's tale has it all. Adventure, excitement, locales galore in the beautiful Czech Republic and of course more beautiful women! Heath Ledger hwas remarkable in this film. I can honestly say it is one of his four or five best movies Ledger ever did. Now let me say that I did not like the thematic music. Rock music from the 1970s has no place in a period piece set in the Middle-ages.

498639,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00000F4ZY,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Few films fill me with the same amount of joy that `A Knights Tale' pulls out of me each and every time I watch it.  It just seems to have everything going for it, and so it easily rises in the ranks for me as one of the finest films of its particular breed.It's fun, fresh and heartwarming.`A Knights Tale' begins with an accidental discovery of talent that launches a young peasant named William into unfamiliar territory as he forges his identity in order to joust.  Along the way he picks up cohorts that help him advance in the medieval tournaments and even help him sway the heart of a young maiden named Jocelyn, who has also fallen under the eye of Count Adhemar, a selfish and malicious man intent of having what he wants and squashing William in the process.The wonderful thing about `A Knights Tale' is that it takes an age-old canvas and completely reinvents it, while maintaining a watchful eye of naysayers who would be quick to dismiss it as a joke.  It modernizes and embellishes the beautiful aspects of the genre while understanding the importance to respect the roots that make this genre so beloved.  While nowhere near as extreme as Baz Luhrmann's take on the musical that very same year (ala `Moulin Rouge!'), `A Knights Tale' uses rock anthems and new world gags to give this film set so far in the past some edge and fresh appeal.  From the set pieces to the costumes (complete with Nike logo) to the oft stunning cinematography and breakneck editing, `A Knights Tale' just gets it.And then there is Heath Ledger.  What a marvelous talent lost to the world, and it is films like this that remind us of his range and the fact that he is so dearly missed.  The way that Ledger layers young William is superb.  He really took the time to create someone guarded yet charismatic (something of a signature for Ledger), while never forgetting those tender touches that elevated his every movement.  The moment where he reunites with his father is especially effective.The rest of the cast is also very good, especially Mark Addy (just love that teddybear), Paul Bettany (this guy needs a better career) and the STUNNING Shannon Sossamon who just yanks your eyeballs out of your skull and conceals them in her dress.Fun, witty, charming and exciting to the very end; `A Knights Tale' is a tale to be told and remembered.",5,Puts a smile on my face every time I watch it!,1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,2336,"['Few', 'films', 'fill', 'same', 'amount', 'joy', 'Knights', 'Tale', 'pulls', 'time', 'watch', 'just', 'have', 'everything', 'going', 'so', 'easily', 'ranks', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'particular', 'breed.It', 'fun', 'fresh', 'heartwarming.', 'Knights', 'Tale', 'begins', 'accidental', 'discovery', 'talent', 'young', 'peasant', 'named', 'William', 'unfamiliar', 'territory', 'identity', 'order', 'joust', 'way', 'up', 'cohorts', 'help', 'advance', 'medieval', 'tournaments', 'even', 'help', 'sway', 'heart', 'young', 'maiden', 'named', 'Jocelyn', 'who', 'also', 'fallen', 'eye', 'Count', 'Adhemar', 'selfish', 'malicious', 'man', 'intent', 'having', 'what', 'squashing', 'William', 'process.The', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'Knights', 'Tale', 'age-old', 'canvas', 'completely', 'reinvents', 'maintaining', 'watchful', 'eye', 'naysayers', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'quick', 'dismiss', 'joke', 'beautiful', 'aspects', 'genre', 'understanding', 'importance', 'respect', 'roots', 'make', 'genre', 'so', 'beloved', 'nowhere', 'as', 'extreme', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'take', 'musical', 'very', 'same', 'year', 'ala', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Knights', 'Tale', 'uses', 'rock', 'anthems', 'new', 'world', 'gags', 'give', 'film', 'set', 'so', 'far', 'past', 'edge', 'fresh', 'appeal', 'set', 'pieces', 'costumes', 'complete', 'Nike', 'logo', 'oft', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'breakneck', 'editing', 'Knights', 'Tale', 'just', 'it.And', 'then', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'What', 'marvelous', 'talent', 'lost', 'world', 'films', 'remind', 'range', 'fact', 'so', 'dearly', 'missed', 'way', 'Ledger', 'layers', 'young', 'William', 'superb', 'really', 'took', 'time', 'create', 'someone', 'guarded', 'yet', 'charismatic', 'something', 'signature', 'Ledger', 'never', 'forgetting', 'tender', 'touches', 'elevated', 'movement', 'moment', 'where', 'father', 'especially', 'effective.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'just', 'love', 'teddybear', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'guy', 'better', 'career', 'STUNNING', 'Shannon', 'Sossamon', 'who', 'just', 'yanks', 'eyeballs', 'skull', 'conceals', 'dress.Fun', 'witty', 'charming', 'exciting', 'very', 'end', 'Knights', 'Tale', 'tale', 'be', 'told', 'remembered']",A Knight's Tale

The application of modern music and language is reserved, well applied and applicable to bringing out the characters and the story-line. Otherwise, the world they create is quite good.

498646,A32MCD01AP5JP5,B00000F4ZY,Anthony Peak,"[5, 7]","A Knight's Tale is what you get when you cross underdog sports drama, comedy, medieval knights, and a healthy dose of Gen X attitude. William Thatcher is a nobody, son of a peasant, fascinated with knights. When the knight he's serving dies before the final round of a joust, William takes a chance and assumes his identity.The show wastes no time whatsoever getting straight to the fun stuff. The above paragraph is the very first thing you'll see in the movie, and the very next is the movie's first joust set to Queen's We Will Rock You. The twist here isn't just a cheap soundtrack, but the fact that it's interwoven into the movie itself. The jousting audience is more of a football crowd, clapping along to the legendary beat and having fun. The herald trumpet players are even shown to belt a few notes, while the guards step along.The best example I can think of this previously is Robin Hood: Men in Tights. A Knight's Tale takes it one step farther however by taking it all very seriously. By the end of the show you could almost believe it. Heralds that sound more like boxing announcers, armor with famous looking logos, ultra modern hair and outfits, and even an amazing dance sequence that blends classical with modern set to David Bowie. It's a highlight of the movie and worth watching just for that scene alone.The best thing I can say about A Knight's Tale is how real it all is, despite it's theme. The modern aspects are blended into the events with real tact, the comedy is honestly funny, and the drama is in no way cheapened by the lightheartedness. It's not exactly Oscar material, but the show has a few honestly dramatic and heart touching moments that are go over extremely well to anyone but scoffing critics.If you've ever had even a slight fascination with Knights and the joust, give this a watch. It's a great movie filled with all the fun and wit one could ask for. The Gen X attitude may seem like a gimmick, but if you're as tired as I am of lame actors speaking in extremely poor old English, this movie is for you.",4,"Fun, if you still know how to have fun.",1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,2051,"['Knight', 'Tale', 'what', 'get', 'when', 'cross', 'underdog', 'sports', 'drama', 'comedy', 'medieval', 'knights', 'healthy', 'dose', 'Gen', 'X', 'attitude', 'William', 'Thatcher', 'nobody', 'son', 'peasant', 'fascinated', 'knights', 'When', 'knight', 'serving', 'dies', 'final', 'round', 'joust', 'William', 'chance', 'identity.The', 'show', 'time', 'whatsoever', 'getting', 'straight', 'fun', 'stuff', 'above', 'paragraph', 'very', 'first', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'see', 'movie', 'very', 'next', 'movie', 'first', 'joust', 'set', 'Queen', 'Will', 'Rock', 'twist', 'here', ""n't"", 'just', 'cheap', 'soundtrack', 'fact', 'interwoven', 'movie', 'jousting', 'audience', 'more', 'football', 'crowd', 'clapping', 'along', 'legendary', 'beat', 'having', 'fun', 'herald', 'trumpet', 'players', 'are', 'even', 'shown', 'belt', 'few', 'notes', 'guards', 'step', 'along.The', 'best', 'example', 'can', 'think', 'previously', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Men', 'Tights', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'one', 'step', 'farther', 'however', 'taking', 'very', 'seriously', 'end', 'show', 'could', 'almost', 'believe', 'sound', 'more', 'boxing', 'announcers', 'armor', 'famous', 'looking', 'logos', 'ultra', 'modern', 'hair', 'outfits', 'even', 'amazing', 'dance', 'sequence', 'classical', 'modern', 'set', 'David', 'Bowie', 'highlight', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'scene', 'alone.The', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'how', 'real', 'theme', 'modern', 'aspects', 'are', 'blended', 'events', 'real', 'tact', 'comedy', 'honestly', 'funny', 'drama', 'way', 'cheapened', 'lightheartedness', 'not', 'exactly', 'Oscar', 'material', 'show', 'few', 'honestly', 'dramatic', 'heart', 'touching', 'moments', 'are', 'go', 'extremely', 'well', 'anyone', 'scoffing', 'critics.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'even', 'slight', 'fascination', 'Knights', 'joust', 'give', 'watch', 'great', 'movie', 'filled', 'fun', 'wit', 'one', 'could', 'ask', 'Gen', 'X', 'attitude', 'may', 'seem', 'gimmick', ""'re"", 'as', 'tired', 'am', 'lame', 'actors', 'speaking', 'extremely', 'poor', 'old', 'English', 'movie']",A Knight's Tale

The movie is about the dangerous sport of jousting, and mostly takes place around the arena, near castles, and sometimes in the woods.

Heath Ledger plays William, a Knight's servant who decides upon his master's death to take up the lance and take his place in a jousting tournament. The success of his first attempt gives him the confidence to keep on competing under an assumed name, exasperating his two humourous friends (Mark Addy, Alan Tudyk) who are terrified because any revelation of William's humble origins will get them all executed. Soon William finds himself a top knight, competing with the evil villain in black (Rufus Sewell) and trying to win the heart of the lovely Lady Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon, a club DJ making a very fine acting debut). The film's best asset is its cheeky use of anachronims: crowds that sing the music of Queen, medieaval dances that blend into David Bowie, Nike symbols on the armour, and its very lively performances give it much more life than it necessarily deserves for a story so routine. Laura Fraser is exceptional as a trailblazing blacksmith, and Paul Bettany steals the show as the very humourous Geoffrey Chaucer, upon whose stories the plot is very loosely based.",4,Jolly good fun!,1001894400,"10 1, 2001",2001,1241,"['younger', 'crowd', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'crowd-pleasing', 'mediaevel', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'turn', 'adults', 'away', 'one', 'got', 'something', 'everyone', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'William', 'Knight', 'servant', 'who', 'master', 'death', 'take', 'up', 'lance', 'take', 'place', 'jousting', 'tournament', 'success', 'first', 'attempt', 'confidence', 'keep', 'competing', 'assumed', 'name', 'exasperating', 'two', 'humourous', 'friends', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'who', 'are', 'terrified', 'revelation', 'William', 'humble', 'origins', 'will', 'get', 'executed', 'Soon', 'William', 'top', 'knight', 'competing', 'evil', 'villain', 'black', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'trying', 'win', 'heart', 'lovely', 'Lady', 'Jocelyn', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'club', 'DJ', 'making', 'very', 'fine', 'acting', 'debut', 'film', 'best', 'asset', 'cheeky', 'use', 'anachronims', 'crowds', 'sing', 'music', 'Queen', 'medieaval', 'dances', 'blend', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Nike', 'armour', 'very', 'lively', 'give', 'much', 'more', 'life', 'necessarily', 'story', 'so', 'routine', 'Laura', 'Fraser', 'exceptional', 'trailblazing', 'blacksmith', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'show', 'very', 'humourous', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'stories', 'plot', 'very', 'loosely', 'based']",A Knight's Tale

I don't know whose fault it is, but this movie can never decide if it wants to be a comedy or a drama and therefore fails at being both.The movie begins with Heath Ledger taking the place of a knight in a joust.  The crowd begins chanting &quot;We will Rock You&quot;, and instantly you know this is going to be a different kind of movie.I'm now prepared for a comedy, a different take on movies such as Gladiator and Robin Hood.  Heath Ledger's friends (including a young Geoffrey Chaucer) provide a lot of the humor and keep the laughs coming.Then the standard plot takes over with Ledger battling another knight for the affections of a girl (who is supposed to be some sort of royalty.)  The girl ends up attending all of the jousts and Ledger wins her over.  But the other knight is still his main rival and the movie concludes with them jousting to see who will win.This part of the movie turns into a drama.  Ledger returns to London to find his father and then people discover he isn't a knight.  Nothing is played for laughs here, and the sentimentality goes overboard.Then the final jousting scene occurs and it is nothing like the many scenes early in the movie.  Nothing is done for laughs and there are no rousing intros by Chauser or crowds chanting modern day rock songs.  Instead the focus is between Ledger and his rival Knight.Somewhere about two thirds through the movie, it quit being funny and started being serious.  The movie lost me there because I didn't want it to be serious.  I wanted it to be clever and funny like the first parts of the movie.",2,What's wrong with this movie?,1013126400,"02 8, 2002",2002,1713,"['How', 'could', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'exciting', 'action', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'quite', 'dissapointing', 'Easy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fault', 'movie', 'can', 'never', 'decide', 'be', 'comedy', 'drama', 'therefore', 'fails', 'being', 'both.The', 'movie', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'taking', 'place', 'knight', 'joust', 'crowd', 'chanting', 'quot', 'will', 'Rock', 'quot', 'instantly', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'different', 'kind', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'now', 'prepared', 'comedy', 'different', 'take', 'movies', 'such', 'Gladiator', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'friends', 'including', 'young', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'provide', 'lot', 'humor', 'keep', 'laughs', 'coming.Then', 'standard', 'plot', 'Ledger', 'battling', 'knight', 'affections', 'girl', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'sort', 'royalty', 'girl', 'up', 'attending', 'jousts', 'Ledger', 'over', 'other', 'knight', 'still', 'main', 'rival', 'movie', 'jousting', 'see', 'who', 'will', 'win.This', 'part', 'movie', 'drama', 'Ledger', 'London', 'find', 'father', 'then', 'people', ""n't"", 'knight', 'Nothing', 'played', 'laughs', 'here', 'sentimentality', 'final', 'jousting', 'scene', 'nothing', 'many', 'scenes', 'early', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'done', 'laughs', 'are', 'rousing', 'intros', 'Chauser', 'crowds', 'chanting', 'modern', 'day', 'rock', 'songs', 'Instead', 'focus', 'Ledger', 'rival', 'Knight.Somewhere', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'quit', 'being', 'funny', 'started', 'being', 'serious', 'movie', 'lost', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'serious', 'wanted', 'be', 'clever', 'funny', 'first', 'parts', 'movie']",A Knight's Tale

A very few years ago it did a several month stretch on the movie channels when it seemed to be on several times a week. It wasn't unusual during that period for my wife and I to catch it every couple of weeks or so.Heath Ledger is perfect as the squire masquerading as a knight, and Rufus Sewell portrays a villain with an unexpected depth of character.Many parts are just as funny to me every time I watch it (in many ways like a lot of scenes in Tootsie).The film is very unique in that it consistently breaks with the 'period', yet seems to portray it in a believable way anyhow. I think the reason for this is that the anachronisms serve to involve us in the events in the same way behavior of the time would have drawn those living several hundred years ago ... but we wouldn't fully understand or appreciate those same behaviors now. So the modern behaviors help to involve us in the same way that those of the period might have felt. That sounded convoluted as I wrote it, I hope people get it. LOL The film is also a beautiful piece of cinematography if you see it well presented. This is a movie that I first saw on cable, many times (and before we had HD). I have since bought it twice. Once to see the original wide-screen format, and again on Blu-ray.If you are not really stuck up and stiff about the movies you watch, and have a sense of humor AT ALL, you will enjoy this film in at least a lesser measure, and likely a greater measure.The Blu ray presentation is gorgeous.

498667,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00000F4ZY,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 3]","In the opening scenes of this film, at a middle ages joust, Queen's We Will Rock You lets all the viewers know they are in for a witty, clever bundle of anachronisms that continually entertain throughout the film. The rock songs are not just overlaid on the story line, they are integrated.The scenes were shot in Prague and retain a real feel of the middle ages in Paris and London. Art direction was very good, especially in the subtle, beautful and wacky costumes. Notice the subtle jewel-like colors in the dance scenes within the palace after William comes in second in his first tournament. Notice the geometric patterns on the costumes. Notice the wonderful choice of gauzy, transparent materials for both actors and actresses to contrast against the armor. The film should have won the Oscar for best costumes in 2001.The acting is very good with Paul Bettany (playing Geoffrey Chaucer), and Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk playing William Thatcher's side kick, Roland and Wat, carrying a considerable load of the comic aspects of the film. Paul Bettany, playing a Chaucer you will never see in an English classroom, was super as a reckless gambling addict, huckster, public relations manager, and promoter.Paul Bettany should have won the Oscar for best supporting actor for his role in this film. He is able to play handsome and edgy while being bright and sarcastic.The use of rock music throughout the film causes you to smile each time it starts. It continues to remind us that times may change but basic human nature remains the same.  It is the details in this film that reveal considerable wit to the careful viewer. For example, watch the crowd reaction when a knight's helmet is knocked off and the men in the stands fight for it like it was a football or baseball. Or, in the opening We Will Rock You scenes, watch the peasants in the stands making a wave before a joust. The insult fest between English and French in a pub prior to a tournament was certainly contemporary in its display of national tensios. Paul Bettany sounds like a professional wrestling promoter as he introduces William before each joust.Don't expect historical accuracy, just sit back and be entertained.The story line is fairly traditional in that William demonstrates that it is strength of character that is the basis for nobility, not birth-rights. Another story line within the film is that demonstrating love is easy so long as it does not challenge your self concept and social structural concepts, but when we are required to demonstrate love by contradicting our self constructs and social constructs, then we are really demonstrating our committment.  Thus William passes the tests set by Lady Joslin as well as the tests set by the evil Count Adhemar.A Knight's Tale is good entertainment, not a history lesson, so sit back and relax!",4,"Anachronisms everywhere, make a good entertainment experience",1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,2831,"['opening', 'scenes', 'film', 'middle', 'ages', 'joust', 'Queen', 'Will', 'Rock', 'lets', 'viewers', 'know', 'are', 'witty', 'clever', 'bundle', 'anachronisms', 'continually', 'entertain', 'film', 'rock', 'songs', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'overlaid', 'story', 'line', 'are', 'integrated.The', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'Prague', 'retain', 'real', 'feel', 'middle', 'ages', 'Paris', 'London', 'Art', 'direction', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'subtle', 'beautful', 'wacky', 'costumes', 'Notice', 'subtle', 'jewel-like', 'colors', 'dance', 'scenes', 'palace', 'William', 'second', 'first', 'tournament', 'Notice', 'geometric', 'patterns', 'costumes', 'Notice', 'wonderful', 'choice', 'gauzy', 'transparent', 'materials', 'actors', 'actresses', 'contrast', 'armor', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'costumes', '2001.The', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'playing', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'playing', 'William', 'Thatcher', 'side', 'kick', 'Roland', 'Wat', 'carrying', 'considerable', 'load', 'comic', 'aspects', 'film', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'playing', 'Chaucer', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'English', 'classroom', 'was', 'super', 'reckless', 'gambling', 'addict', 'huckster', 'public', 'relations', 'manager', 'promoter.Paul', 'Bettany', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'role', 'film', 'able', 'play', 'handsome', 'edgy', 'being', 'bright', 'sarcastic.The', 'use', 'rock', 'music', 'film', 'smile', 'time', 'remind', 'times', 'may', 'change', 'basic', 'human', 'nature', 'same', 'details', 'film', 'considerable', 'wit', 'careful', 'viewer', 'example', 'watch', 'crowd', 'reaction', 'when', 'knight', 'helmet', 'knocked', 'off', 'men', 'stands', 'fight', 'was', 'football', 'baseball', 'opening', 'Will', 'Rock', 'scenes', 'watch', 'peasants', 'stands', 'making', 'wave', 'joust', 'insult', 'fest', 'English', 'French', 'pub', 'prior', 'tournament', 'was', 'certainly', 'contemporary', 'display', 'national', 'tensios', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'promoter', 'William', 'joust.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'be', 'entertained.The', 'story', 'line', 'fairly', 'traditional', 'William', 'strength', 'character', 'basis', 'nobility', 'not', 'birth-rights', 'story', 'line', 'film', 'demonstrating', 'love', 'easy', 'so', 'long', 'not', 'challenge', 'self', 'concept', 'social', 'structural', 'concepts', 'when', 'are', 'required', 'demonstrate', 'love', 'contradicting', 'self', 'constructs', 'social', 'constructs', 'then', 'are', 'really', 'demonstrating', 'committment', 'Thus', 'William', 'tests', 'set', 'Lady', 'Joslin', 'as', 'well', 'tests', 'set', 'evil', 'Count', 'Adhemar.A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'good', 'entertainment', 'not', 'history', 'lesson', 'sit', 'back', 'relax']",A Knight's Tale

'A Knight's Tale' just proved to me how fun a movie can be. I don't think the film itself tries to be serious, though the dramatic parts can be a bit overdone.'A Knight's Tale' is about a peasant named William Thatcher, who wishes one day to &quot;change his stars&quot; and become a knight. His father left William one day to the care of another knight. Years later, William and his friends, Roland and Wat, discover the knight dead. Willing to take his place, William poses as the knight and wins. This sparks a growing interest in his mind, and William convinces his buddies to join him on his quest to become a champion jouster. Along the way, they encounter Geoffrey Chaucer, their match announcer, and Kate, a female blacksmith. William also begins to fall in love with the fair Jocelyn, hoping to win her heart. The only problem is is that he is not a noble knight, so he must continue this charade, until...The story is set to rock music, such as Queen's &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and dancing to David Bowie's &quot;Golden Years.&quot; I think this accurately sets the mood and I can't help but smile every time the peasants clap at the jousting tournaments in unison.Characters are nicely acted. The supporting characters had a lot of chemistry with each other, especially between Geoffrey and Wat (ok, not really). Shannyn Sossamon, who is a newcomer, did a nice job playing Jocelyn. The only thing that I did not enjoy watching in the film were the dramatic scenes. They didn't seem right and it seemed as if they were trying to slow the momentum.All in all, 'A Knight's Tale' is something you can enjoy watching if you don't want something to sentimental or full of perverse jokes.

498673,A3E8BTA2SXPV3P,B00000F4ZY,cinemagirl,"[0, 1]","First and foremost, this film is not trying to grab an Oscar; it is not trying to be deemed the most historically accurate film of all time; it is merely trying to entertain (think MTV, think Jim Carrey comedy, think Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie). So, this is a &quot;flick,&quot; not a film by any means. How does it rate there?The film opens with &quot;We Will Rock You,&quot; which may jarr a few audience members. This is a conglomeration of the old and the new: costumes, language, and people will be painfully anachronous. Acceptable? Unforgivable? It depends on how badly one needs to relax and just enjoy some mindless fun. No summary will be given here, as there are plenty contained in previous reviews.The it-listed Heath Ledger plays William Thatcher, a role that does not demand much acting muscle; however, Ledger does his job well playing an ambitious young pauper-turned-hero. Newcomer Shannyn Sossamon plays his romantic interest, Jocelyn, with more frigidity than expected. She has obvious charisma and charm, but it would have been the film's benefit if she had played the role with a little more warmth rather than her adoption of the archetypal cold princess persona. The real stars are the actors who portray Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) and Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell). The virtually unknown Bettany shows his acting chops in this film, stealing the show with his vibrancy. The talented Sewell could have played the humdrum villainous without any spark, but he manages to bring sympathy to the role.Is this another manufactured flick that follows the 1-2-3 formula? Yes, but the key word here is &quot;energy.&quot; A tedious medieval dance that segues into David Bowie's &quot;Golden Years&quot; only invites audience glee. As for the negatives: Thatcher's childhood scenes are plopped down in inappropriate places, which screams director Brian Helgeland's attempt for a saccharine moment (&quot;Now, everyone, this is where you 'aww' and shed a little tear, okay?&quot;). The only positive arising from this is Christopher Cazenove's genuine performance as John Thatcher, William's father. Someone cast this man in a serious and dramatic film.The jousting scenes, intially thrilling, quickly become tiring and repetitive - how many times can a person see splinters a-flying in slow motion? In addition, the fact that a month is enough time for an unpolished knight wannabe to become an unbeatable knight is somewhat eyebrow-lifting, but then again, this is a movie.The verdict: the characters are fun, the love story somewhat interesting, and the lines are sometimes funny. However, ultimately the anachronistic music hurts the film, as it brings the film from the &quot;just good fun&quot; level to the &quot;man, this is really ridiculous&quot; level. The film is energetic and fun without the &quot;aid&quot; of Queen, thank you very much. This is a good flick - a great film? The absolute best? No, not by a long shot.

In this latest attempt to fill seats and make money, a Medieval setting featuring several jousting tournaments (including the world championship) is accented by a soundtrack that mixes an original Medieval-type score with, of all things, classic rock.  To some, that may seem like a fresh and exciting twist, but to me at least, it only serves to bury this already-laughable flick even deeper.  In my opinion, the movie itself wasn't even all that great; the plot is pretty much as simple as it gets (the whole story's in the trailers!), the dialogue was pretty much ripped from an episode of &quot;Xena&quot;, the action was bordering on just plain goofy (although I did actually flinch at several of the lance shots these guys were taking), and, of course, the soundtrack (don't even get me started).  Strangely, though, it seemed that every time this flick fell on its face, something would happen that almost redeemed it.  It was pretty much a rollercoaster for the emotions, actually; I groaned, I laughed, I flinched...all told, though, the groans were more frequent than anything else, and between that and looking at my watch at least twice during the movie, it makes a good summary for how it turned out.  Medieval &quot;purists&quot; will probably be insulted by this flick, but a few action fans might get a kick out of it.  Far as me, it was definitely not the best eight bucks I ever spent.

498682,A31HN3JZNRB74Y,B00000F4ZY,"daibhidh ""daibhidh""","[3, 6]","This is a fun 2-hour pile of raucous fluff. Heath Ledger is great as William Thatcher (aka, Ulrich von Lichtenstein, a very eccentric knight in history who did not behave like Thatcher at all), and his compatriots (including a nifty, scoundrelish Geoffrey Chaucer) are fun. The jousting scenes and costuming are enjoyable; much has been made of the use of classic rocks tunes with the soundtrack, but it works well enough, given the light-hearted tone that dominates through the majority of the movie.Rufus Sewell is good (though underused) as the villainous Count Adhemar, though the attempt to portray him as the aristocratic past (constrasting him with Ledger as the egalitarian future) didn't quite gel with the overall tone of the movie. The appearance of Edward ""The Black Prince"" was nice, although I could see early on that he was ending up a plot device to bail out Thatcher.My biggest problem with this movie is the casting of Shannyn Sossamon (aka, Angelina Jolie LITE), who doesn't work at all, except as eye candy. I think the writer/director/producer must have been in love with her, because her role as Jocelyn seemed crafted as a star vehicle for her, showcasing her within the story without making her a real part of it. The costuming and hairstyles they did for her are jarringly out of step with everybody else around her, and I found them very distracting. Yes, she's pretty, but I found her painfully anachronistic -- is she an Asian princess? A French merchant daughter? A Jewess (ala Ivanhoe)? It's unclear and is never explained. Her dad is mentioned as wanting her to marry the Count, and I can't fathom any medieval father wanting his seemingly well-born daughter to love a commoner (even a recently knighted one as Thatcher is). After watching it, I laughed that after the ""Thatcher wins the girl"" ending kiss, she leaves him behind and marries the Count, knowing where her interests lie.I had hoped Thatcher would end up with Kate, the cheeky (and striking) armorer who does more for Thatcher than Jocelyn ever does by crafting him a great suit of armor that makes his career possible. But she's only played in a minor role -- I was envisioning a medieval ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" situation with Kate and William, but they didn't do that. The linear love story (William loves Jocelyn, Jocelyn loves William) is sadly lacking any real bumps (they have one minor bump, and it's clear that the Count will have no chance with her). Let's make them work for their unlikely love, yes?Another thing I didn't like was that William's knightly activities are confined solely to the jousting lists -- I had hoped he'd have his mettle (and metal!) tested in actual war. The cameos by the Black Prince made me think William might actually see what true knighthood entailed in warfare, but that doesn't happen, either. So, it's all ultimately a game for William.This is a fun movie, despite itself; it could have been an excellent one, if the writer/director/producer had worked through several more revisions and tightened up the story and made Jocelyn fit in more with the world she was in, instead of making her look like a smug refugee from a Star Trek set.",3,Jousting for Jocelyn,1041811200,"01 6, 2003",2003,3175,"['fun', '2-hour', 'pile', 'raucous', 'fluff', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'great', 'William', 'Thatcher', 'aka', 'Ulrich', 'von', 'Lichtenstein', 'very', 'eccentric', 'knight', 'history', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'behave', 'Thatcher', 'compatriots', 'including', 'nifty', 'scoundrelish', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'are', 'fun', 'jousting', 'scenes', 'costuming', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'much', 'been', 'made', 'use', 'classic', 'rocks', 'tunes', 'soundtrack', 'well', 'enough', 'given', 'light-hearted', 'tone', 'majority', 'movie.Rufus', 'Sewell', 'good', 'underused', 'villainous', 'Count', 'Adhemar', 'attempt', 'portray', 'aristocratic', 'past', 'constrasting', 'Ledger', 'egalitarian', 'future', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'gel', 'overall', 'tone', 'movie', 'appearance', 'Edward', 'Black', 'Prince', 'was', 'nice', 'could', 'see', 'early', 'was', 'ending', 'up', 'plot', 'device', 'bail', 'out', 'Thatcher.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'casting', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'aka', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'LITE', 'who', ""n't"", 'work', 'eye', 'candy', 'think', 'writer/director/producer', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'love', 'role', 'Jocelyn', 'seemed', 'crafted', 'star', 'vehicle', 'showcasing', 'story', 'making', 'real', 'part', 'costuming', 'hairstyles', 'did', 'are', 'jarringly', 'step', 'everybody', 'else', 'found', 'very', 'distracting', 'Yes', 'pretty', 'found', 'painfully', 'anachronistic', 'Asian', 'princess', 'French', 'merchant', 'daughter', 'Jewess', 'ala', 'Ivanhoe', 'unclear', 'never', 'explained', 'dad', 'mentioned', 'wanting', 'marry', 'Count', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'medieval', 'father', 'wanting', 'seemingly', 'well-born', 'daughter', 'love', 'commoner', 'even', 'recently', 'knighted', 'one', 'Thatcher', 'watching', 'laughed', 'Thatcher', 'girl', 'ending', 'kiss', 'marries', 'Count', 'knowing', 'where', 'interests', 'lie.I', 'had', 'hoped', 'Thatcher', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'Kate', 'cheeky', 'striking', 'armorer', 'who', 'more', 'Thatcher', 'Jocelyn', 'ever', 'crafting', 'great', 'suit', 'armor', 'career', 'possible', 'only', 'played', 'minor', 'role', 'was', 'envisioning', 'medieval', 'Kind', 'Wonderful', 'situation', 'Kate', 'William', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'linear', 'love', 'story', 'William', 'Jocelyn', 'Jocelyn', 'William', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'real', 'bumps', 'have', 'one', 'minor', 'bump', 'clear', 'Count', 'will', 'have', 'chance', 'Let', 'make', 'work', 'unlikely', 'love', 'yes', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'William', 'knightly', 'activities', 'are', 'confined', 'solely', 'jousting', 'lists', 'had', 'hoped', ""'d"", 'have', 'mettle', 'metal', 'tested', 'actual', 'war', 'cameos', 'Black', 'Prince', 'made', 'think', 'William', 'might', 'actually', 'see', 'what', 'true', 'knighthood', 'entailed', 'warfare', ""n't"", 'happen', 'So', 'ultimately', 'game', 'William.This', 'fun', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'one', 'writer/director/producer', 'had', 'worked', 'several', 'more', 'revisions', 'tightened', 'up', 'story', 'made', 'Jocelyn', 'fit', 'more', 'world', 'was', 'instead', 'making', 'look', 'smug', 'refugee', 'Star', 'Trek', 'set']",A Knight's Tale

Out of desperation, William (played by Heath Ledger) takes over the role of Sir Ector and accompanied by the two other remaining squires continues on their quest to win tournaments, ergo make a living for themselves.On the road to the next challenge of arms they run into a naked guy walking down the road who turns out to be no other than the young Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany). Geoffrey seems to have a gambling problem and lost all. The trio allow him to accompany them as he, Geoffrey, has the ability to forge the proper documents to show that Charles is a true knight...all this is quite illegal of course.The story is a story of the little guy making good. It is the adventure of these three men as they go from tournament to tournament, surprisingly winning them as they go! Of course there is a love interest for William, and an evil enemy. The plot is pretty loose but this is not a movie you go to in order to bask I a great plot line; nor should I mention, expect historical accuracy...far, far from it. But this is actually part of the charm of this movie. It has some truly hilarious parts in it and if you watch very closely, the makers of this film have slipped all kinds of treats in here and there.As an example, first you have to remember that this is supposed to be 14th-century Europe. Right from the start you will find the peasants rocking out and singing ""We Will Rock You"" and ""Golden Years."" This is an absolute hoot. If you look closer, you will find such things as the Nike symbol on armor, contemporary clothing on some of the women; which include styles from the 1930s and 1940s, hair styles that simply are not old European. Accents from today are mingled with those of yesterday as well as attitudes toward just about everything.One of the high spots of this picture was Paul Bettany's portrayal of Geoffrey Chaucer.

It's Helgeland's unique vision that makes this film truly special.The disc is loaded with wonderful extras--a dozen-or-so deleted/alternate scenes, several mini-documentaries on characters and effects and music and more, wonderful commentary tracks, and even a Queen (with Robbie Williams) music video.Leave your prejudices at the door and see the film for what Helgeland intended it to be.  Smartly paced, snappy dialogue, fine performances--Paul Bettany as Chaucer and Mark Addy as Roland will have you smiling throughout, and you can't help but hiss at Rufus Sewell's Count Adhemar--a driving soundtrack and so much romance you'll wonder why Meg Ryan's not in it.Worth every penny.

He plays a peasant who masquerades as a knight, so that he can joust, after his master, who also jousts, dies.  The cast of characters that surround Ledger are absolutely fabulous.  I love it that they have Geoffrey Chaucer in his group of friends.  The actor who plays him is very handsome and the character is hilarious.  Chaucer has a gambling problem, and that causes some problems, but he also plays Ledger's announcer--he is the one who introduces Ledger at the beginning of the jousting matches--and he really hams it up, which is very funny.  I like the female blacksmith who makes Ledger's armor, she puts Nike logos on it as her trademark, and joins Ledger's entourage.Of course, Ledger takes the jousting tournament season by storm, and he becomes extremely popular.  He and the villain (whose name I cannot remember), the only knight that he cannot defeat at jousting, are both vying for the hand of the same woman, of course Ledger wins her heart, but the villain causes problems for their relationship towards the end of the movie.  The romantic aspect of this movie is the only one that I did not thoroughly love.Everything comes to a head at the Jousting World Championships in London.  At this point I want to mention the character of Prince Edward of England, he and Ledger meet in a jousting match during the season.  Ledger makes quite an impression on the prince when he is the only knight who has the guts to actually compete against him. (The villain has a chance to joust against the Prince, but he withdraws from the match to avoid having to joust against his Prince.)  Anyway, the Prince plays an essential role in the way the movie ends, and I really liked the way he was portrayed.This was just a wonderfully funny and good movie and I would recommend it to anyone.",5,This movie is sooooo good--it is very funny.,989625600,"05 12, 2001",2001,1888,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'movie', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'such', 'great', 'actor', 'soooo', 'handsome', 'peasant', 'who', 'knight', 'so', 'can', 'joust', 'master', 'who', 'also', 'dies', 'cast', 'characters', 'surround', 'Ledger', 'are', 'absolutely', 'fabulous', 'love', 'have', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'group', 'friends', 'actor', 'who', 'very', 'handsome', 'character', 'hilarious', 'Chaucer', 'gambling', 'problem', 'problems', 'also', 'Ledger', 'announcer', 'one', 'who', 'Ledger', 'beginning', 'jousting', 'matches', 'really', 'up', 'very', 'funny', 'female', 'blacksmith', 'who', 'Ledger', 'armor', 'Nike', 'logos', 'trademark', 'Ledger', 'entourage.Of', 'course', 'Ledger', 'jousting', 'tournament', 'season', 'storm', 'extremely', 'popular', 'villain', 'name', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'only', 'knight', 'can', 'not', 'defeat', 'jousting', 'are', 'vying', 'hand', 'same', 'woman', 'course', 'Ledger', 'heart', 'villain', 'problems', 'relationship', 'end', 'movie', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'thoroughly', 'love.Everything', 'head', 'Jousting', 'World', 'Championships', 'London', 'point', 'want', 'mention', 'character', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'England', 'Ledger', 'meet', 'jousting', 'match', 'season', 'Ledger', 'quite', 'impression', 'prince', 'when', 'only', 'knight', 'who', 'guts', 'actually', 'compete', 'villain', 'chance', 'joust', 'Prince', 'match', 'avoid', 'having', 'joust', 'Prince', 'Anyway', 'Prince', 'essential', 'role', 'way', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'way', 'was', 'portrayed.This', 'was', 'just', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone']",A Knight's Tale

498698,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00000F4ZY,D. Litton,"[12, 15]","Peasants chanting Queen's &quot;We Will Rock You?&quot; A medieval royal ball gone disco? You may think it's silly, and you'd be right: it's absolutely ridiculous. But &quot;A Knight's Tale&quot; dares to walk the tightrope of placing the old with the new, incorporating modern songs and phrases into an era gone by, and it succeeds in doing so. The perfect mix of grandeur, passion, and exciting action, director Brian Helgeland tells a likeable tale that, for me, is a real triumph of a film.From the beginning, the movie puts forth its own set of rules, as peasants sing &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; during a jousting match; at this point, you either accept the movie's machinations, or turn away in contempt. At the center of the excitement is William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), a squire whose master has just taken part in his last match. Desperately in need of money for food, he and his partners Roland and Wat (Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk) decide to finish the match themselves, and William dons the armor and takes the arena by storm, giving new meaning to the phrase &quot;natural born.&quot;But that isn't enough for the ambitious lad, whose life-long dream of becoming a knight stems from his father's instillation of hope in him. After encountering Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) and striking a deal with him to concoct a fictitious family history for William, they make their way to several jousting matches, where William takes a new identity, a new love interest in Lady Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon), and a new rival in Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell), whose jealousy over William's fame and popularity stir his devious mind.A somewhat formulaic plot, you might say, but when you're having so much fun in a film such as this, does it really matter? There is such a high spirit to the movie, an energy so exciting and full of joy that any inhibitions you originally had will be swept aside once the movie invites you on its trek.Much of this enjoyment is due to the cast, which is stellar in all fields. Ledger is the ideal embodiment of a hero, and his character's mission becomes one of hope and strength through his forthright acting. He and newcomer Sossamon share a warm chemistry, one that is as vibrant as a medieval tapestry. Addy, Tudyk, and Bettany are riotous as William's cohorts, each of them possessing a warm spirit that makes this supporting cast one of the year's best. The rival Adhemar is played exquisitely by Sewell, who even has that cunning look and characteristic about him.Director Helgeland, who also wrote the film, brings an upbeat feel to the movie, even in its more emotional scenes. His portrayal of a medieval setting is less articulate than something along the lines of, say, &quot;Excalibur,&quot; but it's nonetheless breathtaking, if not exquisite. Helgeland also instills a high energy into the jousting matches, giving us many different points of view, and charging each scene with fast-paced editing and the roar of cheering audiences in the arena.The movie's true high point is the comic relief, stemming from the mix of 14th century settings with post-modern culture. The &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; sequence is bursting with laughs and upbeat charisma, a successful opener to the film. A medieval ball that begins with harmonic melodies resonates into David Bowie's &quot;Golden Years,&quot; and the scene practically takes flight. Some may sneer at the mixture, but it is purely nothing more than good-natured fun, and I fully recommend it.While scenarios such as this are nothing new, they are rarely done so well, and that's what makes &quot;A Knight's Tale&quot; such a special movie. It's got everything you could ask for in a movie: genuine comedy, a believable love story, likeable characters, and a plot that never stops moving. It's brilliant combination of eras and culture is nonetheless upbeat and inspired, and I enjoyed every minute of it. One of the best films of the year.",5,One of the year's best!

It saddens me that so many movie goers never really got his films, or often talked about them as trivial and unimportant. I found his roles ripe, fresh and full of vigor and controversy. Roles that spanned the epic The Patriot, to Lords of Dogtown and The Ten Things I hate about you; as well as the endearing and touching Brokeback Mountain. We were just getting a soft whisper of a voice yet unheard, that was only beginning to shout to the world how a champion would be born.What could have been, like River, we shall never know, but I think I speak for a majority of movie lovers, who will appreciate his work until our own passing, and give condolences to his family, his friends, his daughter, and the countless lives he touched with his amazing and powerful roles, and the jaded ways of our world, and our lives in it, and why and how a young life can be so suddently taken from us, before it has a chance to really shine and set afire the world of cinema.His wit and charm and smiles in A Knight's Tale, made it easy to like him, and root him on. Its hard to do a period piece, with humor and sincerity, while rocking a music selection that others would find abruptly unsuitable.

Writer/director Brian Helgeland, who scored big with &#65533;L.A. Confidential&#65533; has followed that excellent effort with a succession of progressively worse screenplays (&#65533;Conspiracy Theory&#65533;, &#65533;The Postman&#65533;, &#65533;Payback&#65533;) culminating in this charming but trite puff piece.The pity is that the story had possibilities.  A squire seizes upon the opportune death of his knight to enter a jousting competition and ultimately, albeit illegitimately, establish himself as a top competitor.  William/Ulrich (Heath Ledger) begins the film with no skills whatever and with the help of his hapless lads, miraculously is transformed into a lean mean jousting machine.  He is then thunderstruck by the utterly bland Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon) and spends the rest of the film trying to win her love.  Meanwhile Kate (Laura Fraser), the only interesting female character, with excellent potential for an intriguing romantic entanglement, is relegated to becoming William&#65533;s groupie.Despite good potential for a serious medieval drama, Helgeland decides that it should follow a rutted and unimaginative formula so that it will appeal to all those millions who have loved this same story in different forms countless times before.  As if that isn&#65533;t enough, he further debases it by filling it with anachronistic contemporary dialogue (&#65533;Oh Wow&#65533;, &#65533;Helllllloooo&#65533;, &#65533;Foxy Lady&#65533;, etc.) and rock music to which all the medieval peasants join in to sing along and boogie.  This wouldn&#65533;t be so bad if the film was constructed to be a spoof, but after each of these absurd digressions, Helgeland switches back into drama mode, asking us once again to take his characters seriously.Helgeland can&#65533;t seem to decide whether he wants this to be a farce, a send up, or a serious drama.  It is all out of sync.  The film is funny when it is trying to be serious and dull when it is trying to be funny.  I don&#65533;t even want to get into how historically unrealistic his depiction of medieval Europe is.  The only redeeming quality of Helgeland&#65533;s direction is the stunt work on the jousting scenes.  The jousting is brilliantly done and (of course) unabashedly overused.  After a couple of dozen broken lances, it is hard to get up for the final match between William and the evil Count Adhemar as all the spectacle has been wrung out.  It would be like having 25 chariot races in Ben-Hur and asking us to be excited about the 26th race against Messala.Heath Ledger is airy and adorable as William, qualities I know I always associate with medieval knights (sarcasm intended).  Ledger plays the part with such lack of force that it is difficult to believe the rushing wind didn&#65533;t knock him off his horse long before the opponent&#65533;s lance hit the mark.  Shannyn Sossamon is pretty, but equally mind-numbing.  Their romance has all the heft of balsa wood and all the maturity of a date to the Junior Prom.Paul Bettany steals what is left of the show with his spirited portrayal of Chaucer.  Bettany provides us with a most remarkable interpretation of the celebrated author, whipping the crowds into frenzy with his commanding introductions.  Rufus Sewell is a passable villain, but comes across more obnoxious than despicable.Overall, this film is so utterly insubstantial and obsequious to the masses that it had to be a hit.  This is another typical Hollywood cotton candy film, sweet with no substance.  It is charming, light, and predicable, giving everyone exactly what they want and expect.

498713,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B00000F4ZY,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[0, 2]","From the blurb I read, the director visualized clashing knights while listening to classic rock. It's at least possible that jousting was to the middle ages what car racing is to us, and rock music might provide an adrenalin pumping soundtrack as a parallel experience. Regardless, it de-fossilizes the medieval period while making it viscerally (or maybe vicariously) present for mainstream audiences.But the real surprise is the character of Geoffrey Chaucer, author of Canterbury Tales, who in this version has a gambling problem. Thus our intrepid would-be knights find him naked on the road, having lost his clothes to his addiction. Writers in movies are usually what Dostoevsky in Notes from Underground called ""Men of Consciousness"" not ""Men of Action"". Chaucer is a man of action (as he perhaps was in his own time), and essential to the plot and story.

As an announcer Geoffrey could give Michael Buffer a run for his money, for sheer passion and theatrics. Quite the character this man Geoffrey Chaucer. Then of course we have Count Adhemar, the villian who thinks only of ""himself, and his own honor"" A perfectly dastardly chap is our Adhemar.Music. What can I say. This is is NOT Medieval period music obviously. Not most of it any way. Most is 70's rock tunes but they appropriately emphasize the comedic nature of this picture to give the the scenes where they are played a little more of humorous punch. In places orchestral music is used, and where that is the case the music is suitably rousing and dramaatic, giving the sceenes where they use it addition tension and a sense of readiness for a big moment to come.Before you start thinking this movie is all laughs, I must say to you that there are several genuinely touching moments in it, like William's reunion with his father after years away and several more I will not mention for fear of spoiling the movie for you. Also the love story in this I found touching as well. Stilted, maybe but heartwarming and certainly poetic in a very real sense.All in all this to me is great family entertainment. Lots of action. Plenty of humor, with touches of tenderness too. If you want a movie that you can just kick back and have fun with it, give this one a try. I loved it and I think you can enjoy it too. The key is relax and have fun with the film. It certainly has a lot of fun with itself. Peace, and God bless you.",5,VERY FUNNY!

498737,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00000F4ZY,Joseph Haschka,"[7, 9]","A KNIGHT'S TALE is a light-hearted, romantic comedy set in the mid-14th century and centered around the sport of jousting.Heath Ledger plays one of three servants of a knight who has the misfortune to fall from his horse and die immediately before his scheduled appearance in a tournament. Since his servants don't eat if their man doesn't compete and win, they find themselves up against it. Ledger, as Will Thatcher, has the daring idea of donning his dead master's armor and competing under his identity. As luck would have it, he wins. Afterwards, he convinces his buddies, Roland and Wat (Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk), to invest the prize money (15 silver pieces) into the equipment needed to prepare and train for the next tournament, then the next. The ultimate goal is the World Championship of Jousting to be held in London.As Will trains in the forest away from prying eyes, he and his two pals provide slapstick comedy reminiscent of the Three Stooges. However, Thatcher perseveres. Finally, the only problem left is to acquire knighthood, since jousting is reserved for the nobility. Our boys soon encounter a naked man walking down the road, who turns out to be the young writer Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany), fleeced of all his possessions by a gambling loss. In exchange for clothes and food, Chaucer forges the appropriate documents that give Will an impressive upper class lineage as Sir Ulrich of Liechtenstein, and afterwards serves as Ulrich's herald.All characters in this delightful film are attractive and well-played, even that of Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell), the treacherous (but extremely capable) fighter who is Will's greatest obstacle to the Big Prize Money. And, since every gallant knight needs a Babe to provide some silky underthing as a token to fight under, we have Shannyn Sossamon as Lady Jocelyn. Sossaman has strong-featured good looks that are sometime spoiled, in my opinion, by coiffures that might be considered bizarre in this day and age, much less the Middle Ages. And Jocelyn's costuming is occasionally tongue-in-cheek humorous. At one point, she wears a hat that brings to mind Audrey Hepburn's Holly Golightly persona in BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S. (My wife, whose one-time hobby was making medieval costumes, chortled at the incongruity of some of Jocelyn's outfits.) Another character that attaches to Sir Ulrich's entourage is the blacksmithess Kate (Laura Fraser). Young and very pretty, one would have expected Kate to provide a love interest for somebody, but disappointingly never does. She serves principally as a foil for the boy-will-be-boys shenanigans of her traveling companions.One of the more quirky elements of A KNIGHT'S TALE is the contemporary classic rock soundtrack. When a disguised Will enters the arena to compete for the first time, the spectators  belt out a rendition of ""We Will Rock You"". Later, as the World Championship contestants ride into London, the crowd sings ""The Boys Are Back In Town"". While seeming absurd at first, it grows on you.I recommend this film as excellent family fare for an afternoon or evening of laughter in front of the castle's wide-screen, HD TV.",4,Campy good fun,1033257600,"09 29, 2002",2002,3150,"['KNIGHT', 'TALE', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'set', 'mid-14th', 'century', 'centered', 'sport', 'jousting.Heath', 'Ledger', 'one', 'three', 'servants', 'knight', 'who', 'misfortune', 'fall', 'horse', 'die', 'immediately', 'scheduled', 'appearance', 'tournament', 'servants', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', 'man', ""n't"", 'compete', 'win', 'find', 'up', 'Ledger', 'Will', 'Thatcher', 'daring', 'idea', 'donning', 'dead', 'master', 'armor', 'competing', 'identity', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'Afterwards', 'buddies', 'Roland', 'Wat', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'invest', 'prize', 'money', '15', 'silver', 'pieces', 'equipment', 'needed', 'prepare', 'train', 'next', 'tournament', 'then', 'next', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'World', 'Championship', 'Jousting', 'be', 'held', 'London.As', 'Will', 'forest', 'away', 'prying', 'eyes', 'two', 'pals', 'provide', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'reminiscent', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'However', 'Thatcher', 'Finally', 'only', 'problem', 'left', 'acquire', 'knighthood', 'jousting', 'reserved', 'nobility', 'boys', 'soon', 'encounter', 'naked', 'man', 'walking', 'down', 'road', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'young', 'writer', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'fleeced', 'possessions', 'gambling', 'loss', 'exchange', 'clothes', 'food', 'Chaucer', 'appropriate', 'documents', 'give', 'Will', 'impressive', 'upper', 'class', 'lineage', 'Sir', 'Ulrich', 'Liechtenstein', 'afterwards', 'serves', 'Ulrich', 'herald.All', 'characters', 'delightful', 'film', 'are', 'attractive', 'well-played', 'even', 'Count', 'Adhemar', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'treacherous', 'extremely', 'capable', 'fighter', 'who', 'Will', 'greatest', 'obstacle', 'Big', 'Prize', 'Money', 'gallant', 'knight', 'Babe', 'provide', 'silky', 'underthing', 'token', 'fight', 'have', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'Lady', 'Jocelyn', 'Sossaman', 'strong-featured', 'good', 'looks', 'are', 'sometime', 'spoiled', 'opinion', 'coiffures', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'bizarre', 'day', 'age', 'much', 'less', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'Jocelyn', 'costuming', 'occasionally', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'humorous', 'one', 'point', 'hat', 'mind', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Holly', 'Golightly', 'BREAKFAST', 'AT', 'TIFFANY', 'My', 'wife', 'one-time', 'hobby', 'was', 'making', 'medieval', 'costumes', 'chortled', 'incongruity', 'Jocelyn', 'outfits', 'character', 'Sir', 'Ulrich', 'entourage', 'blacksmithess', 'Kate', 'Laura', 'Fraser', 'Young', 'very', 'pretty', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'Kate', 'provide', 'love', 'interest', 'somebody', 'disappointingly', 'never', 'principally', 'foil', 'boy-will-be-boys', 'shenanigans', 'traveling', 'companions.One', 'more', 'quirky', 'elements', 'A', 'KNIGHT', 'TALE', 'contemporary', 'classic', 'rock', 'soundtrack', 'When', 'disguised', 'Will', 'arena', 'compete', 'first', 'time', 'spectators', 'belt', 'out', 'rendition', 'Will', 'Rock', 'Later', 'World', 'Championship', 'contestants', 'ride', 'London', 'crowd', 'Boys', 'Are', 'Back', 'Town', 'seeming', 'absurd', 'first', 'you.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'excellent', 'family', 'fare', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'laughter', 'front', 'castle', 'wide-screen', 'HD', 'TV']",A Knight's Tale

I am not &#34;into&#34; medievil films exactly, so I'm no purist regarding the particulars I read in the negative reviews of the movie. I began watching it without any preconceived notions and took it at face value. Tudyk and Bettany's characters (and wonderful acting) are entertaining enough to carry the film regardless of anyone's tastes or preferences in genre. If you want to watch a light-hearted movie that will entertain (without getting angry that they dared to put &#34;that&#34; kind of music with &#34;this&#34; kind of movie) you'll most likely enjoy it as much as I did.Rotten Tomatoes critics gave it 58%, audiences 80%. The negative consensus seems to be that the haters detested the idea of mixing modern with medievil.  It seems to me that the fun in a lot of movies is the idea that you can say, &#34;What if this happened...&#34; and not really have to be technical about it all. If you're making a documentary, I agree, you should be as specific and correct about factual things as possible. But, if you're just having fun and asking the audience to imagine along with you, what's the harm?If you want to watch a more serious-minded adventure set in medievil times, do not watch this movie. It will only make you mad.  If you're just in the mood to forget about your worries, stresses, and all the bad news we're bombarded with in daily life, give it a try.Movies I loved (to give you an idea of what I think is good): Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Avatar, Groundhog Day, Matrix, Big Fish, Catch Me if You Can, O Brother Where Art Thou, The Color Purple, Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Pride & Prejudice, Sling Blade, True Grit, Shallow Hal, Uncle Buck, Inception, et. al.One last note: I love all the History Channel reenactment series',, i.e., Battles B.C.

Featuring some of Hollywood's hottest new talents, such as, Heath Ledger (""The Patriot"" and ""The Order""), Paul Bettany (""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Firewall""), Shannyn Sossamon (""The Order"" and ""Rules of Attraction""), and the always evil and engaging Rufus Sewell (""Dark City"" and ""The Legend of Zorro""), this movie, though met with much skepticism due to its blending of things old and new, when handled by such an acclaimed director, Brian Helgeland (""Payback"") was guaranteed to at least be entertaining, if not a sure fire hit.""A Knight's Tale"" is the story of young William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), a peasant squire who breaks a long-standing tradition when he passes himself off as a noble in order to joust.  With the help of his friends, and a loud-mouthed announcer named Chaucer (Paul Bettany), William is determined to prove to the world that you don't have to come from nobility to achieve greatness.  As he climbs the ranks of the jousting world, one man stands in William's way of achieving his goal, that man is Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell).  Not only is Count Adhemar the best jouster, and one that is determined to do whatever it takes to win, but he also has set his sights on William's new girlfriend (Shannyn Sossamon).  With the world on his shoulders, Williams must go head-to-head in a no-holds-barred joust with his arch-rival to see who will be the world champion jouster, and to prove to all, that any man can have what it takes to be a knight.The story of ""A Knight's Tale"" may sound like a standard run of the mill action/adventure movie, except set in medieval times, but the well-written characters being fleshed out by the terrific actors brings the entire proceeding up to a much higher level.  I must admit that the prospect of mixing modern day anthemic rock ballads with jousting didn't seem like a great fit, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and hearing Queen's timeless classic `We Will Rock You' during a joust, makes you want to join in with the cheering crowds.  The jousting scenes are truly exciting to watch, and the witty, hilarious introductions by Paul Bettany's character Chaucer (supposedly the famous writer) are perfect lead-ins for getting both the crowd on film and the movie-going audience charged up and ready to go.  All of these elements are pieced together perfectly by director Brian Helgeland, who balances his previous work on ""Payback"" with Mel Gibson, a film that was extremely dark and violent, with this more upbeat, family-oriented action/adventure.The film never lets up on the excitement level, though I don't mean to make the movie sound like it's one big action sequence, it has plenty of dramatic moments that propel the storyline, yet even in these quieter moments there is still a sense of drive and excitement for the audience and the characters to feed off of.

What really scares me is that some who see this movie may think its an accurate depiction of the middle ages. I can see if it were supposed to be a farce, a spoof on the time period--but even then the story was bland. But there was no historical accuracy at all, save for maybe the jousting scenes. And we certainly were treated to enough of those. The language, clothing (loved the see through dress on the princess--I'm sure that was the rage in medieval France), mannerisms and especially, the place of women. Yes, princesses and upper class women just roamed the streets unescorted, traveled all over the country and beyond, had strange men bringing them notes in their bedroom and had sex whenever they wanted. In reality, Ulrich/William wouldn't have been able to get near that woman, and in fact, probably never would've even laid eyes on her because she wouldn't have been out on the street! I don't understand the reason for this movie--why make it take place in the middle ages if nothing at all is accurate? It reminded me of a bunch of people just dressing up for a costume party on a Hollywood set. There is no feeling at all that you are in another place and time.Aside from that, the acting is pretty bland and the character lukewarm. Especially unappealing is Jocelyn, who is so moronic and dull, and not particularly good looking. It really pushes the imagination as to why William would be so enthralled with her. His groupie Kate the blacksmith was far more attractive and interesting, although I tend to doubt there were any female blacksmiths at the time. Her clothes and hairdo reminded one more of a women from the American wild west, several centuries later. All in all, an awful movie. We fast forwarded it after a while, just to get to the final scene and hoping beyond hope, that he'd get rid of Jocelyn and get it on with Kate.",1,Awful Beyond Comprehension,1003708800,"10 22, 2001",2001,1987,"['am', 'absolutely', 'amazed', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'even', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'fun', 'movie', 'What', 'really', 'who', 'see', 'movie', 'may', 'think', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'middle', 'ages', 'can', 'see', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'farce', 'spoof', 'time', 'period', 'even', 'then', 'story', 'was', 'bland', 'was', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'save', 'maybe', 'jousting', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'were', 'treated', 'enough', 'language', 'clothing', 'loved', 'see', 'dress', 'princess', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'rage', 'medieval', 'France', 'mannerisms', 'especially', 'place', 'women', 'Yes', 'princesses', 'upper', 'class', 'women', 'just', 'roamed', 'streets', 'unescorted', 'traveled', 'country', 'had', 'strange', 'men', 'bringing', 'notes', 'bedroom', 'had', 'sex', 'whenever', 'wanted', 'reality', 'Ulrich/William', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'woman', 'fact', 'probably', 'never', 'would', ""'ve"", 'even', 'laid', 'eyes', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'out', 'street', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'reason', 'movie', 'why', 'make', 'take', 'place', 'middle', 'ages', 'nothing', 'accurate', 'reminded', 'bunch', 'people', 'just', 'dressing', 'up', 'costume', 'party', 'Hollywood', 'set', 'feeling', 'are', 'place', 'time.Aside', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bland', 'character', 'lukewarm', 'Especially', 'unappealing', 'Jocelyn', 'who', 'so', 'moronic', 'dull', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'looking', 'really', 'imagination', 'why', 'William', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'enthralled', 'groupie', 'Kate', 'blacksmith', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'attractive', 'interesting', 'tend', 'doubt', 'were', 'female', 'blacksmiths', 'time', 'clothes', 'hairdo', 'reminded', 'one', 'more', 'women', 'American', 'wild', 'west', 'several', 'centuries', 'later', 'awful', 'movie', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'while', 'just', 'get', 'final', 'scene', 'hoping', 'hope', ""'d"", 'get', 'rid', 'Jocelyn', 'get', 'Kate']",A Knight's Tale

They tend to be boring, full of stilted dialogue, and oftentimes pretentious.  I watch movies to have fun, not to watch an overwrought spectacle that takes itself far too seriously and, more often than not, seems to be fishing for an Oscar rather than trying to be entertaining.  Call me a schlub or an uncultured heathen, but that's simply my feelings on the subject.  So I avoided ""A Knight's Tale"" for awhile, simply because I assumed it was another drab medieval film.  But then I read a review, discovered the decidedly modern bent of the film (which the reviewer hated), and immediately decided that any film that managed to combine jousting knights with the music of Queen, AC/DC, War, and Bachman-Turner Overdrive had to be worth a look.If you're expecting a serious historical film, or even one that's historically accurate, look elsewhere.  But if you're wanting a fun medieval romp that makes no pretense at taking itself seriously, you're well on your way to enjoying this film.Young squire William Thatcher aspires to someday become a knight and to compete in the jousting tournaments, despite being a peasant's son and having no noble blood.  He gets his chance at stardom when, upon the death of his master, he's forced to disguise himself and take his place in a tournament.  With the aid of his fellow squires, sensible Roland and snarky Wat, and a wandering writer by the name of Geoffrey Chaucer, he takes on the persona of a fictional knight, Ulric von Liechtenstein, to continue to compete.  Along the way he brazenly courts the semi-rebellious noblewoman Joselyn, receives aid from a female blacksmith, makes a powerful enemy in rival jouster Count Adhemar, and ends up taking the jousting world by storm while valiantly trying to cover up his true identity.  And his rags-to-riches story is accompanied not by music of the era or an orchestral score, but by classic rock of the '70s.This movie takes quite a bit of liberty with historical facts, and doesn't try to hide that it's putting entertainment over accuracy.  In my mind, the film is all the better for it.  If one is able to accept that the film is going more for entertainment than accuracy, they're able to more fully enjoy the story and characters.  That way, when anachronisms do rear their heads, one isn't jarred completely out of the film by them.  (Though it's worth noting that more than one source has pointed out that, for all its rock songs and Joselyn's decidedly modern-looking dresses, ""A Knight's Tale"" is still more historically accurate than many of the so-called ""serious"" medieval epics out there.  For one thing, female blacksmiths DID exist -- though it's highly unlikely that they put the Nike swoosh on the armor they forged...)The story is one that's been told multiple times -- an underdog takes on the big dogs in a favorite sport and comes out on top -- but the medieval bent to it gives it a new twist.  It's actually pretty fun to see a sports story set in another time period, and to see that for all the obvious differences between our time and theirs, some things never did change.  We still obsess over sports figures and favorite pastimes, and it's still satisfying to see the little guy score a victory.  And the characters are a delightful bunch, still managing to be snarky, witty, and playful even when they're using the dialogue and slang of the day.  (Though the term ""foxy lady"" does come up once in the movie -- and somehow Heath Ledger manages to make it work in context.)If you're willing to suspend your disbelief, this is a fun movie, with a great soundtrack, fun characters, and plenty of humor to make up for the predictable story.

Then, of course, there's a great villain, who I felt was only there to fill the need of having a villain.The real story is about Ledger's character becoming something he isn't allowed to be by the standards of the day.  It shows how a hero is measured not by his nobility or rank, but by his heart.  Along the way, Ledger's sidekicks provide comic relief and the action in the jousting competitions is great.Overall, a solid movie that only has a couple of holes in it.

This movie is fun-- the non-period elements are part of the charm.  When the characters all do a semi-medieval dance to a David Bowie song, it's really a good moment.  It's funny, it doesn't take itself too seriously (unlike me sometimes) and it is an entertaining look at class warfare, how we can sometimes get so caught up in what is the ""norm"" that we forget what really should be.The scene where Chaucer promises his revenge on the evil summoner & pardoner is something that makes anyone who has read the Canterbury Tales (especially the naughty stories they don't always teach in high school) laugh out loud.

Bettany and Purefoy steal the scenes they're in and Ledger does fine work. I saw it in the theater and then again on DVD.Heath Ledger appears as the handsome leading man he is, with a strong sense of comedy, and is able to work the scenes well, which is good, because as a successful screenwriter (Brian Hedgeland) the scenes don't hang together, are not seamless, are choppy, don't fit either the scene before or the scene after, and on occasion leave you with that uncertain feeling of 'that doesn't make sense.'William Thatcher is given a chance by his commoner father to ""follow his star"" and become the Squire to a Knight of the Realm. Good stuff and not uncommon to that age. Could have used a little explanation. The age is about the 10th or 11th century so we're in heady company here with Arthur, Modred, Excalibur, that whole Camelot charade, of course Chaucer, and the importance of the class system and nobility.Here's where the script starts to slip. Some time should have been spent on why noble birth became an issue. Because that's what happens at the end and why William gets (OK, sorry to do this) unseated.Secondly, Chaucer. This has got nothing to do with the Canterbury Tales. I took a course on them at Fordham College a thousand years ago. It should be noted in the opening credits as one of those movies with a quasi-disclaimer ""from an idea by."" Here it would say ""from an idea, that we think, had he been alive today and really high, Geoffrey Chaucer might have kidded about.""So then there's Shannyn, with 2 n's and a y . . . no, I've said enough.And Edward, the Black Prince of Wales (James Purefoy) who is brilliant in a small role, could have been given the words to explain to us why he couldn't get a match (""I coulda been somebody"" - Terry Malloy) and why he honors William at the end.All in all, as a comedy with a touch of evil, a teary reunion with Dad, a sexy interlude with Lady Jocelyn, and great special effects, it's a fun, visually rewarding movie. No problems with the anachronisms and Freddy Mercury and Bowie aside, well placed and fun.And Paul Bettany's impersonation of Michael Buffer is great. Still, it's chopped up. 4 stars.

498761,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00000F4ZY,Lawyeraau,"[1, 3]","This highly enjoyable, fairy tale of a film revolves around the efforts of William, a tanner's son, trying to change his destiny. His father gave him up into servitude to a knight, when William was a slip of a lad, in hopes of his having a better future. When he grows up, William, remembering his father's advice, reaches for the stars in an effort to become what he has always dreamed of being, a knight in shining armor.Played to perfection by the very hunky and charismatic Heath Ledger, William gets his big break when the knight, whom he serves, dies during a jousting competition. Donning his knight's armor and substituting secretly for the knight, he handily, though clumsily, wins the competition and its purse. He persuades Roland and Wat, the other two vassals who also served the now dead knight, to assist him in his efforts to continue competing. They reluctantly agree and begin helping him train for future jousting competitions. William, however, needs credentials establishing his knighthood in order to compete, as mere peasants are prohibited to do so. He has the good fortune to run into a man of letters, Geoffrey Chaucer, who happens to be a bit down on his luck. Chaucer agrees to provide him with forged patents in order to enter tournaments.William, playing the role of a knight named Ulric Von Lichtenstein, becomes a force with which to be reckoned on the playing field. This does not pass unnoticed by an evil knight, Count Adhemar, played with deliciously wicked malice by Rufus Sewell, who does not hesitate to play dirty on and off the field, if necessary, in order to win. William, however, plays his role most honorably and nobly.William falls in love with the Lady Jocelyn, whom Sewell also covets and intends to marry, but Lady Jocelyn, played by lovely newcomer, Shannyn Sossamon, may be falling for our erstwhile hero. This turn of events makes Count Adhemar all the more determined to win on and off the field. When a jousting competition brings them all to William's hometown, Adhemar pulls out all the stops in an effort to settle the matter once and for all.This is truly a fun film. The viewer can't help but love the ever so earnest William, played by the simpatico and romantically handsome Heath Ledger. Paul Bettany, as the insouciant and scampish Chaucer, very nearly steals the film, so terrific is he in his role. Rufus Sewell is both sexy and ruthless as the unprincipled and haughty Count Adhemar. The rest of the supporting cast is likewise superb, with the exception of Shannyn Sossamon who does not seem fit the role of one to the manor born.While the plot seems somewhat formulaic, it is made new by the interjection of modern day music and customs. Watch as the crowd gathered for the jousting competition stomps, claps, and does the ""wave"" in time to Queen's rousing song, ""We Will Rock You"". See Chaucer act as a modern day huckster for his knight, working the crowd to a fever pitch. Look to the dance led by William at a post jousting reception at the local castle. Likewise, Jocelyn's costumes, at times, resemble haute couture. These modern day interjections that occur throughout the film, though jarring, keep this age old story fresh and funny.

498762,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00000F4ZY,Lee Armstrong,"[5, 5]","""A Knight's Tale"" was delightful to me when I saw it in the theatre.  I recently started thinking about how much I liked it and then saw a copy @ a bargain price.  Heath Ledger never seems light, even when in a frothy bit of romantic comedy from the middle ages.  There is a fierce intensity to his work.  His one Oscar nomination came for Best Actor for ""Brokeback Mountain"" in 2005, a film for which he won similar awards from critics' associations in Las Vegas, New York, Phoenix, San Francisco & St. Louis.  As William Thatcher, he is a joy to watch as the servant who dreamed he could become a knight.Director Brian Helgeland won an Oscar for screenwriting for ""L.A. Confidential"" in 1997 & was similarly nominated for ""Mystic River.""  I found the DVD extras interesting as his explanation of why the rock music that is clearly out of period was used.  His concept tried to make the period easy to relate to for modern audiences and show the energy from those times as if they were happening today.  The dance sequence is still amazing.Alan Tudyk's flaming red hair looks great on the DVD.  Tudyk came to the screen with ""Patch Adams,"" ""The Wonder Boys"" & with Sandra Bullock in ""28 Days.""  As Wat, he lends great comic timing.  Some of the deleted scenes are priceless as he mugs wildly.  His sidekick Mark Addy who played with Ledger in ""The Order"" as well as his breakout role in ""The Full Monty"" does a good job as the rotund Roland who eagerly helps William in hopes that he will get to see his family again.Paul Bettany came to the fore in ""A Beautiful Mind"" & as the flagellating albino priest inThe Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition), but I particularly liked him as a romantic lead in what was a critically slammed film,Wimbledon.  As Geoffrey Chaucer, Bettany bares his behind to show the wordsmith with a gambling addiction.  The deleted scene where William, Wat & Roland follow a naked Chaucer only to meet his wife is hilarious.Shannyn Sossamon was discovered for this role when she was spinning discs for a party.  I've enjoyed her work on TV's ""Moonlight,"" the vampire series.  As Jocelyn, she is lovely and brings kind of a romantic wisdom to the part.  While I've read she's compared frequently to Angelina Jolie, I kept thinking of Keira Knightly as I watched this DVD.  The scene where William follows her on horseback into a church put a smile on my face.Rufus Sewell is another intense actor.  He had a supporting part in the Jude Law-Cameron Diaz film I liked,The Holiday, as well as a major part in the excellent filmThe Illusionist (Widescreen Edition).  As Count Adehmar, he is as ruthless as he is good looking.  The strength of his arrogance contributes strongly to the making Thatcher such a sympathetic character.Christopher Cazenove who was in one of my favorite films, ""Eye of the Needle"" from 1981, plays William's father.

Heath Ledger is cast as low-born serf who impersonates a knight and wins jousting matches, eventually winning over the villain and getting the beautiful noble-born woman.  This is not a film to take seriously, especially since the sound track includes a whole bunch of modern rock pieces - ""We are the Champions:"", ""We Will Rock You"", ""Taking Care of Business"", etc.  I sometimes laughed out loud at this silly film but I must say I enjoyed it.All the actors did a good job, playing their roles with a sense of whimsy. Paul Bethany is cast in the role of Chaucer and the whole film is based very very loosely on one of his Canterbury Tales. I particularly thought that Rufus Sewell, cast in the role of the villain nobleman was excellent as well as James Purfoy who I remembered from his role as Brutus in the TV series ""Rome"".  Both of these gentleman seemed more like real men than the blond haired slim Heath Ledger but I think the casting was perfect.I enjoyed this film.

Silly me (and sis) had come to see an authentic treatment of knights and pageants and got this unholy mess instead. Sis was particularly incensed at the buffoonish portrayal of Geoffrey Chaucer served up. That didn't have quite the resonance for me, but everyone has their issues, I guess. I was more ticked off at the stupid love interest woman who clearly thought she was &quot;all that&quot;, and like all who entertain such ideas about themselves, she really wasn't.

I thought it was brilliant and witty and funny and stirring, even after I watched it for a second, third and fourth time...if anything, it actually got better with each repeat viewing.As a general rule, I love knights and castles and medieval weapons. In fact, there's a special place in my heart for all things medieval--except for the black plague of course! Sadly, though, I find that most movies about knights and medieval times are actually rather pathetic. Not so in this case, though. This movie really worked!Yes, as many reviewers have pointed out, this movie has a contemporary soundtrack, not an authentic medieval one. But personally, I liked that. It reminded me that even though this movie is set in olden times, the kids back then were the same as they are today--they wanted to go out dancing to hip tunes and get into fights and fall in love and become heroes and live their dreams and make a better life for themselves. The lifestyle might have been different back then, but the people were basically the same as they are now. Plus, the songs in the soundtrack were classics, and I was glad of any excuse to hear them! I wanted to play the air guitar along with them...although, in the interests of medieval authenticity, I had to make do with an air gittern.I'm not going to rehash the plot of this movie for you, as every other reviewer here has pretty much done that already. But I will tell you a few things that I think you ought to know.Firstly, when you watch this movie, do NOT turn it off when you get to the final credits, because after the credits there's a brilliantly funny bonus scene. Unfortunately, many people miss seeing this scene because they switch off too early, and that's a shame. Watch it. You'll cack yourself laughing.Secondly, here's an interesting historical fact that you won't find out in this movie: the 'fictional' persona that the hero of this story adopts, that of Count Ulrich Von Lichtenstein (I hope I spelt that right!) really did exist. Only, the real Ulrich was actually a bit of a weirdo. You see, back in those days, the jousts were a bit like pro-wrestling is today. Fighters used to dress up and take on 'characters'. As I understand it, Ulrich actually spent an entire tournament season dressed up as a woman. And apparently, that wasn't the strangest outfit he ever wore! Also, Ulrich was so over the top, he once cut off his finger and sent it to a lady to prove his devotion to her. And she wasn't even his lover, but just a wealthy lady whom he wished to represent in the tournaments! None of these historical facts appear in the movie, but I live in the hope that they'll turn up in a sequel one day...",5,A tale to treasure,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,2706,"['have', 'say', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'witty', 'funny', 'stirring', 'even', 'watched', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'anything', 'actually', 'got', 'better', 'repeat', 'general', 'rule', 'love', 'knights', 'castles', 'medieval', 'weapons', 'fact', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'things', 'medieval', 'black', 'plague', 'course', 'Sadly', 'find', 'most', 'movies', 'knights', 'medieval', 'times', 'are', 'actually', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'Not', 'so', 'case', 'though', 'movie', 'really', 'worked', 'Yes', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'movie', 'contemporary', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'authentic', 'medieval', 'one', 'personally', 'liked', 'reminded', 'even', 'movie', 'set', 'olden', 'times', 'kids', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'same', 'are', 'today', 'wanted', 'go', 'out', 'dancing', 'hip', 'tunes', 'get', 'fights', 'fall', 'love', 'become', 'heroes', 'live', 'dreams', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'lifestyle', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'back', 'then', 'people', 'were', 'basically', 'same', 'are', 'now', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'were', 'classics', 'was', 'glad', 'excuse', 'hear', 'wanted', 'play', 'air', 'guitar', 'interests', 'medieval', 'authenticity', 'had', 'make', 'do', 'air', 'gittern.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'rehash', 'plot', 'movie', 'other', 'reviewer', 'here', 'pretty', 'much', 'done', 'already', 'will', 'tell', 'few', 'things', 'think', 'ought', 'know.Firstly', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'do', 'NOT', 'turn', 'off', 'when', 'get', 'final', 'credits', 'credits', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'bonus', 'scene', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'people', 'miss', 'seeing', 'scene', 'switch', 'too', 'early', 'shame', 'Watch', ""'ll"", 'cack', 'laughing.Secondly', 'here', 'interesting', 'historical', 'fact', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'movie', ""'fictional"", 'persona', 'hero', 'story', 'Count', 'Ulrich', 'Von', 'Lichtenstein', 'hope', 'spelt', 'right', 'really', 'did', 'exist', 'Only', 'real', 'Ulrich', 'was', 'actually', 'bit', 'weirdo', 'see', 'back', 'days', 'jousts', 'were', 'bit', 'pro-wrestling', 'today', 'Fighters', 'used', 'dress', 'up', 'take', ""'characters"", 'understand', 'Ulrich', 'actually', 'spent', 'entire', 'tournament', 'season', 'dressed', 'up', 'woman', 'apparently', 'was', ""n't"", 'strangest', 'outfit', 'ever', 'wore', 'Also', 'Ulrich', 'was', 'so', 'top', 'once', 'cut', 'off', 'finger', 'sent', 'lady', 'prove', 'devotion', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'lover', 'just', 'wealthy', 'lady', 'whom', 'wished', 'represent', 'tournaments', 'None', 'historical', 'facts', 'appear', 'movie', 'live', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'turn', 'up', 'sequel', 'one', 'day']",A Knight's Tale

498778,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00000F4ZY,Matthew Horner,"[3, 5]","Mixing in a rock and roll soundtrack with a tale about the medieval sport of jousting may sound like a recipe for disaster, but A Knight's Tale manages to beat the odds and provide us with some tasty entertainment. Purists may argue that it grossly distorts history. There's really no argument because it does. The truth is that the movies have always done this. With few exceptions, historical epics have never reflected the values of the times they were set in. They've reflected modern values. As for the music they use, sweeping orchestral scores may feel more appropriate, but for any movie set more than four hundred years ago, these are almost as anachronistic as rock and roll. One could even argue that rock music is more in attuned to the bawdy tavern songs of the 14th Century, when A Knight's Tale takes place, than is classical fare.William, Roland and Wat [Heath Ledger, Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk] are three peasants in service to an old knight who competes in jousts, which were popular games in England and France in the Middle Ages. Two knights in armor would charge each other on horseback and try knock each other to the ground with their lances. This was a dangerous game, but it was not a blood sport. Everyone was welcome to witness these events, but only noblemen could compete.One morning, William and the others discover that their knight has died in his sleep. They can either let William take the knight's place in the game and try to fool the lords or they can starve to death. They chose the deception, and William wins the joust. Heady with victory, they begin to practice in earnest. The problem remains that William is not a knight, but in their travels they meet up with Chaucer [Paul Bettany], who later would become a very famous writer. Chaucer expertly forges papers that say William is royalty and then joins the trio as they travel around to various tournaments. Along the way, William falls for a beautiful noblewoman [Shannyn Sossaman]. He also makes an enemy of the evil Count Adhemer [Rufus Sewell], who vows revenge at any costThe movie is an odd mixture of comedy, adventure, period history and parody, but it works. An early tournament starts out seriously, but then the crowd breaks out into The Wave. We see spectators with their faces painted as if they were pro football fanatics. A lovely female armorer, who wouldn't have existed back then, makes a new metal suit for our hero and engraves it with her trademark, which just happens to be the Nike logo. When William first dances with his lady love, rock music suddenly breaks out, and it looks like these long ago revelers are at a disco. If there is a fault with all this, it is that there isn't quite enough of it. Towards the end, the movie tends to become a more standard adventure, as if its makers were a bit uncertain of their own creation.Heath Ledger is fine as William. This young Australian has a bright future in movies. In some scenes he looks eerily like Errol Flynn. Rufus Sewell is a lot of fun as the pompous villain. It is Paul Bettany's Chaucer, however, who virtually steals the movie.I suspect director Brian Helgeland succeeded partly because he is blithely ignorant of many aspects of history. In an interview he said he thought kids in 14th Century had music that was not their parents' music just like kids today. That simply isn't true. Ironically, much of the rock music used in A Knight's Tale, such as Rock On and Golden Years, is the music of today's kids' parents. Fortunately for Helgeland, his limited view of history is irrelevant because the movie works. It isn't history. It's entertainment.",4,The Middle Ages meet rock and roll in delightful romp,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,3628,"['Mixing', 'rock', 'roll', 'soundtrack', 'tale', 'medieval', 'sport', 'jousting', 'may', 'sound', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'beat', 'odds', 'provide', 'tasty', 'entertainment', 'Purists', 'may', 'argue', 'grossly', 'history', 'really', 'argument', 'truth', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'done', 'few', 'exceptions', 'historical', 'epics', 'have', 'never', 'reflected', 'values', 'times', 'were', 'set', ""'ve"", 'reflected', 'modern', 'values', 'music', 'use', 'sweeping', 'orchestral', 'scores', 'may', 'feel', 'more', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'set', 'more', 'four', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'almost', 'as', 'anachronistic', 'rock', 'roll', 'One', 'could', 'even', 'argue', 'rock', 'music', 'more', 'attuned', 'bawdy', 'tavern', 'songs', '14th', 'Century', 'when', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'place', 'classical', 'fare.William', 'Roland', 'Wat', '[', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', ']', 'are', 'three', 'peasants', 'service', 'old', 'knight', 'who', 'jousts', 'were', 'popular', 'games', 'England', 'France', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'Two', 'knights', 'armor', 'would', 'charge', 'other', 'horseback', 'try', 'knock', 'other', 'ground', 'lances', 'was', 'dangerous', 'game', 'was', 'not', 'blood', 'sport', 'Everyone', 'was', 'welcome', 'witness', 'events', 'only', 'noblemen', 'could', 'compete.One', 'morning', 'William', 'others', 'discover', 'knight', 'died', 'sleep', 'can', 'either', 'let', 'William', 'take', 'knight', 'place', 'game', 'try', 'fool', 'lords', 'can', 'starve', 'death', 'chose', 'deception', 'William', 'joust', 'Heady', 'victory', 'begin', 'practice', 'earnest', 'problem', 'William', 'not', 'knight', 'travels', 'meet', 'up', 'Chaucer', '[', 'Paul', 'Bettany', ']', 'who', 'later', 'would', 'become', 'very', 'famous', 'writer', 'Chaucer', 'expertly', 'papers', 'say', 'William', 'royalty', 'then', 'trio', 'travel', 'various', 'tournaments', 'way', 'William', 'beautiful', 'noblewoman', '[', 'Shannyn', 'Sossaman', ']', 'also', 'enemy', 'evil', 'Count', 'Adhemer', '[', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', ']', 'who', 'revenge', 'costThe', 'movie', 'odd', 'mixture', 'comedy', 'adventure', 'period', 'history', 'parody', 'early', 'tournament', 'out', 'seriously', 'then', 'crowd', 'out', 'Wave', 'see', 'spectators', 'painted', 'were', 'pro', 'football', 'fanatics', 'lovely', 'female', 'armorer', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'existed', 'back', 'then', 'new', 'metal', 'suit', 'hero', 'trademark', 'just', 'be', 'Nike', 'logo', 'When', 'William', 'first', 'lady', 'love', 'rock', 'music', 'suddenly', 'out', 'long', 'ago', 'revelers', 'are', 'disco', 'fault', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enough', 'end', 'movie', 'become', 'more', 'standard', 'adventure', 'makers', 'were', 'bit', 'uncertain', 'own', 'creation.Heath', 'Ledger', 'fine', 'William', 'young', 'Australian', 'bright', 'future', 'movies', 'scenes', 'eerily', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'lot', 'fun', 'pompous', 'villain', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Chaucer', 'however', 'who', 'virtually', 'movie.I', 'suspect', 'director', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'succeeded', 'partly', 'blithely', 'ignorant', 'many', 'aspects', 'history', 'interview', 'said', 'thought', 'kids', '14th', 'Century', 'had', 'music', 'was', 'not', 'parents', 'music', 'just', 'kids', 'today', 'simply', ""n't"", 'true', 'Ironically', 'much', 'rock', 'music', 'used', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'such', 'Rock', 'Golden', 'Years', 'music', 'today', 'kids', 'parents', 'Fortunately', 'Helgeland', 'limited', 'view', 'history', 'irrelevant', 'movie', ""n't"", 'history', 'entertainment']",A Knight's Tale

Heath Ledger is a peasant who worms his way into the knight class and is suddenly an unstoppable jouster after practicing really hard for only a month. By beating everyone who comes in his path he is sure to make his mark in the tournament championship.The jousting scenes are nicely done and shot, but there's an endless amount of them! One after another after another. A third of the film's running time would be cut out if they only gave us a streamlined version. It gets tiring seeing the same joust situation over and over again.Another gripe of mine is that I thought this movie was supposed to have a level of campy humor. It might have, but I didn't see it. There are as many &quot;funny&quot; lines as I have fingers on my hands. There's too few lines of humor to make it campy so it's pulled back into a mediocre drama.The characters aren't much to care for either, especially Heath Ledger's romantic interest. She's royalty and thus is to wrapped up in herself. She's too cold for the audience to like.There might be some entertainment for some groups in this.

It's set in the 14th century, yet when they put modern songs to certain scenes, it just doesn't seem right! I mean, they start dancing to David Bowie? The dancing's cool though!

He was accompanied by a truly great cast of actors that gained their own recognition in this movie as well. The movie may seem a bit quirky with the introduction of more modern music by Queen, David Bowie, & several other artists, but it fits in place like a piece of puzzle & completes the chemistry of the movie.

498791,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B00000F4ZY,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","This is a movie that does not take itself too seriously.  That is evident from the opening scene where a medieval jousting match is set to We Will Rock you.  In fact there are rock songs from the  1970s and 1980s all throughout the movie.  The story is pretty basic, a peasant pretends to be a noble so he can enter tournament games.  He falls in love with a fair maiden, has an adversary to deal with and risks being found out all along the way.The strength of the movie is the cast.  If the Joker in Dark Knight ended up being Heath Ledger's signature role, this is the one that established him as having Hollywood lead potential.  His character William was a blend of heroic, prideful, stubborn, and naive and he pulled them off very well.  As well as adding an element of humor.  The supporting cast was also great.  Paul Bettany was the standout as Geoffrey Chaucer (who announced William's matches.  Mark Addy,  Alan Tudyk (who any fan of Joss Whedon's recent TV series will recognize) and Laura Fraser all did great in their respective roles as William's crew.  I also thought Shannyn Sossamon did a fair job as the love interest, although her performance was nothing to write home about.  It was one of her first movie roles and she was relatively green.  The role called more for her to look pretty than it did for and academy award winning acting performance.Ultimately the movie is not going to appeal to everyone.  It does not even really attempt to be a very serious or overly dramatic movie.  Certainly not a historically accurate period piece.  It was meant to be a fun, even silly at times movie that blended action and comedy.  To that end it pulled it off well.  And if you are a fan of those kinds of movies or any of the actors involved it is a fine way to spend a couple hours.",5,A fun movie,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,1798,"['movie', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'evident', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'medieval', 'jousting', 'match', 'set', 'Will', 'Rock', 'fact', 'are', 'rock', 'songs', '1970s', '1980s', 'movie', 'story', 'pretty', 'basic', 'peasant', 'pretends', 'be', 'noble', 'can', 'enter', 'tournament', 'games', 'love', 'fair', 'maiden', 'adversary', 'deal', 'risks', 'being', 'found', 'all', 'way.The', 'strength', 'movie', 'cast', 'Joker', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'signature', 'role', 'one', 'established', 'having', 'Hollywood', 'lead', 'potential', 'character', 'William', 'was', 'blend', 'heroic', 'prideful', 'stubborn', 'naive', 'pulled', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'As', 'well', 'adding', 'element', 'humor', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'was', 'standout', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'who', 'announced', 'William', 'matches', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'who', 'fan', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'recent', 'TV', 'series', 'will', 'recognize', 'Laura', 'Fraser', 'did', 'great', 'respective', 'roles', 'William', 'crew', 'also', 'thought', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'did', 'fair', 'job', 'love', 'interest', 'performance', 'was', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'movie', 'roles', 'was', 'relatively', 'green', 'role', 'called', 'more', 'look', 'pretty', 'did', 'academy', 'award', 'winning', 'acting', 'performance.Ultimately', 'movie', 'not', 'going', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'attempt', 'be', 'very', 'serious', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'Certainly', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'period', 'piece', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'fun', 'even', 'silly', 'times', 'movie', 'blended', 'action', 'comedy', 'end', 'pulled', 'off', 'well', 'are', 'fan', 'kinds', 'movies', 'actors', 'involved', 'fine', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours']",A Knight's Tale

498797,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00000F4ZY,Monty Moonlight,"[2, 3]","A Knight's Tale is the inspiring story of a young squire's dream of becoming more than he was born into. As a boy, William's father, a humble Thatcher, brought his boy to Sir Ector, a knight who could provide the child with a better, or at least more interesting life. Years later, on their way to a jousting tournament, Sir Ector dies, leaving William and his partners, Roland and Wat, without a provider. Knowing there will be money and food waiting for them at the tournament, the starving group decides to go anyway, with William disguising himself as Sir Ector. But they are soon surprised to find that William has a talent for jousting, and there's much money to be had in the sport. Along the road they meet the one and only Chaucer, who agrees to act as Herald for the would-be knight, William. Together, the gang sweeps the Jousting tournaments, and William, competing under a pseudonym since he is not of noble birth and therefore breaking the law by competing, becomes a famous sports hero. He continues to make friends and enemies along the way, particularly a sassy, young noble woman (though I thought the blacksmith girl who joined his band was more attractive and had a better personality), and a mean-spirited, arrogant bully of a knight who also has his sights set on the lady. With the help of his friends, William must  win the heart of his dream-girl, deal with his competition, and somehow win the Grand Championship without getting busted for pretending to be a real knight.A Knight's Tale is a great story and great fun, but makes a less than successful attempt at times to be Disney's Hercules. Most of the film is just a great, inspirational, historical tale, but there are times when the film tries to be modern, with the characters singing along to classic rock, and dancing in modern styles. Had this been something that was carried on throughout the film, it might have worked, but since it only happened a few times, it just seemed so odd and out of place. The theme of having classic rock running throughout the film worked fine as background music, it's when the characters seem aware of the ""modern"" music that it throws off the viewer. This was a wonderful film, and I'm sorry to say that the couple of times that they took this approach I became a bit embarrassed to be watching it. It's still well worth owning, it's just a shame that they couldn't decide what sort of movie they wanted to be with the 20th century mixings.",4,"Pretty good, but could have been great!",1026086400,"07 8, 2002",2002,2460,"['Knight', 'Tale', 'inspiring', 'story', 'young', 'squire', 'dream', 'becoming', 'more', 'was', 'born', 'boy', 'William', 'father', 'humble', 'Thatcher', 'brought', 'boy', 'Sir', 'Ector', 'knight', 'who', 'could', 'provide', 'child', 'better', 'least', 'more', 'interesting', 'life', 'Years', 'later', 'way', 'jousting', 'tournament', 'Sir', 'Ector', 'leaving', 'William', 'partners', 'Roland', 'Wat', 'provider', 'Knowing', 'will', 'be', 'money', 'food', 'waiting', 'tournament', 'starving', 'group', 'go', 'anyway', 'William', 'disguising', 'Sir', 'Ector', 'are', 'soon', 'surprised', 'find', 'William', 'talent', 'jousting', 'much', 'money', 'be', 'had', 'sport', 'road', 'meet', 'one', 'only', 'Chaucer', 'who', 'act', 'Herald', 'would-be', 'knight', 'William', 'Together', 'gang', 'Jousting', 'tournaments', 'William', 'competing', 'pseudonym', 'not', 'noble', 'birth', 'therefore', 'breaking', 'law', 'competing', 'famous', 'sports', 'hero', 'make', 'friends', 'enemies', 'way', 'particularly', 'sassy', 'young', 'noble', 'woman', 'thought', 'blacksmith', 'girl', 'who', 'joined', 'band', 'was', 'more', 'attractive', 'had', 'better', 'personality', 'mean-spirited', 'arrogant', 'bully', 'knight', 'who', 'also', 'sights', 'set', 'lady', 'help', 'friends', 'William', 'must', 'win', 'heart', 'dream-girl', 'deal', 'competition', 'somehow', 'win', 'Grand', 'Championship', 'getting', 'busted', 'pretending', 'be', 'real', 'knight.A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'fun', 'less', 'successful', 'attempt', 'times', 'be', 'Disney', 'Hercules', 'Most', 'film', 'just', 'great', 'inspirational', 'historical', 'tale', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'modern', 'characters', 'singing', 'along', 'classic', 'rock', 'dancing', 'modern', 'styles', 'Had', 'been', 'something', 'was', 'carried', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'only', 'happened', 'few', 'times', 'just', 'seemed', 'so', 'odd', 'place', 'theme', 'having', 'classic', 'rock', 'running', 'film', 'worked', 'fine', 'background', 'music', 'when', 'characters', 'seem', 'aware', 'modern', 'music', 'viewer', 'was', 'wonderful', 'film', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'couple', 'times', 'took', 'approach', 'became', 'bit', 'embarrassed', 'be', 'watching', 'still', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'just', 'shame', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'what', 'sort', 'movie', 'wanted', 'be', '20th', 'century', 'mixings']",A Knight's Tale

This was in all likelihood due to the combination of rock music in ancient times clashing with our knowledge of history and our delicate sensibilities. However, having both seen this at the cinema and owning it on DVD, I would like to hope that this movie will be given a second chance to win new viewers as it really is a good film and great fun!Heath Ledger (The Patriot) displaying great charm and a winning smile throughout, plays William Thatcher, squire to a washed up champion jouster, who dies during a competition, leaving William to masquerade as his master in order to collect their winnings. Aided by his initially less than enthusiatic pals Roland (Mark Addy from Full Monty) and Wat (Alan Tudyk, 28 Days) William fakes nobility to illegally enter competitions. On their travels they encounter a naked wanderer, the future famed author, Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) who joins their `crusade' and helps to forge William's ancestral lineage, so that he can take part in the noblemen only games. Whilst competing (according to my wife who seems to like every Australian film star) the very handsome William catches the eye of a lady, Jocelyn (the very beautiful Shannyn Sossamon), and sets out to win her heart. However, standing between William and his two goals of winning the World Championships and winning the hand of Lady Jocelyn stands the dastardly Count Adhemar (brilliantly played by Rufus Sewell, Dark City).This is a surprising change of direction for writer/Director Brian Helgelend (LA Confidential). This movie is great fun and the mixture of rock music (they sing, clap and stamp Queen's We Will Rock You before each joust) and medieval times works surprisingly well, adding to the excitement and atmosphere of each competition. Both Heath Ledger and Shannyn Sossamon shine in their lead roles and share excellent on-screen sexual chemistry. However, it is Paul Bettany who steals most scenes as the occasionally naked, always in trouble, lyrical Geoffrey Chaucer. Also watch out for James Purefoy in a relatively small role (but tipped for greater things)!Extra features on the DVD include a light-hearted commentary from Brian Helgeland and Paul Bettany, where they reveal some of the FX tricks of the trade and hear Helgeland feign ignorance of the fact that they didn't dance to David Bowie in 1366 or play Queen's &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; at jousting tournaments. There is also a passable documentary and some excellent deleted scenes and a music video where Britains most popular of current musical stars Robbie Williams performs Queen's &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; with all the pomp and grandiosity of Freddie Mercury, outlining why he is considered natural heir to Mercury's throne as Britains Greatest Showman.Four stars for the movie (five stars are far too often and easily dispensed), four stars for the extras.

Not only does he give a charismatic and compelling early performance, the film itself is a lot of fun: a very clever and entertaining update of the old knight in shining armor swashbuckling saga, that turns it into a comical version of the classic sports success story, such asRockyorThe Karate Kid.Heath's not the only one that makes this worth seeing; Rufus Sewell is the villian you love to hate, and Paul Bettany (as Chaucer, whose story of the same name inThe Canterbury Talesthis is loosely based on) and Alan Tudyk as a comic and loyal sidekick, are fun to watch and give engaging performances.

In spite of the film's negative aspects, seeing it is not a waste of time. A Knight's Tale is a film that successfully combines adventure, romance, drama, and comedy in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen nextThe flaws in this film are somewhat obvious. First and foremost, it is not authentic. The storyline is set in medieval 13th century England. In the beginning of the film there is a jousting tournament, and the spectators are actually singing the words to &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. That is not what I call authentic to a medieval 13th century England setting.

What this movie is though, is a  lot of fun. It is medieval with a modern twist. This movie is set in 14th century France/London. This movie is over all very well done. The characters are great, especially the character of Geoffery Chaucer, though not very historically accurate in presentation ( He would still in his teenage years when this movie was set), but  he is deffinatly funny and quirky and unexpected. The costumes in this movie, though not historically accurate, are a lot of fun.One of the only characters that irked me was Rufus Sewell's character. He's such a great actor especially in movie like Dangerous Beauty and Cold Confort Farm, but I don't think he was right for the role of the villian, he's trying hard to be evil and mean. The other character that irked me slightly was Heath Ledgers love interest. She's far to stuck up and snobby for my taste. I much prefered Laura Frazier's character.

No profound messages about exploring the darker side of the human soul, or any of that gobbledygook.  Oh sure, there's a little socio-political jab at the idea of class distinctions and social elitism, but that's as serious as it gets.  The rest of the movie is just plain fun.The story centers around William Thatcher, a young peasant-born squire who has a natural talent for jousting and a dream to rise above his humble circumstances.  With the aid of a small band of trusty friends, including the inimitable Geoffrey Chaucer, our young hero sets off to make his mark on a noble man's world. And what a mark he makes!Of course, there's the obligatory girl to be won, and the dashingly handsome but utterly ruthless rival to compete with for her hand.  The action scenes are well done if somewhat repetitive (there are only so many ways to depict a joust), but of course the focus is on the final meeting between the good guy and the bad guy.  The plot is not particularly complicated, although there is one neat twist toward the end of the movie that makes you cheer for &quot;our side.&quot;  Some of the characters are extremely funny, and provide great comic relief throughout.By the way, this one's suitable for the whole family.

Being a medieval history buff, I made myself close eyes on numerous colossal absurdities (costumes with sewed in sleeves, cowboy-style breeches, a woman-armorer and dozens, dozens of more) and enjoyed this witty, well-directed, well-acted spectacle. What more do you need in a movies where courage, generosity and friendship win over wickedness and intrigues, bringing knightly virtues &quot;to the masses&quot;?Although as if set in France and England of the 14th century, it's a fairytale world that merely looks a bit like medieval Europe. A world where clear-skinned babes in fantastically un-medieval costumes can be sarcastic to clergymen, where a lance striking in the chest squarely for countless times merely chafes inconsequently, where a young ruffian (H. Ledger) can train himself to be a knight over two weeks, enter the world of beautiful maidens (who are being tanned and hazel-eyed deviate far from the beauty standards of those times), contests with a ruthless count (R. Sewell) raised on combat, wins tournament after tournament, finds glory, riches and receives his knighthood from the tip of the sword of the Crown Prince.The cast owes to 2/3 of the flick's success: HL, young, burly, righteous and purposeful, infects the viewer with his ardent zeal &quot;to change his own stars&quot;; RS is perfect in his brooding dark looks as a stunning arrogant villain (whose role is dramatically underwritten, unfortunately); P. Bettany as J. Chaucer is dissolute and roguish, the supporting cast of W Thatcher's best buddies - one silent and reserved, the other - cock-sure and quick-tempered - give you many funny moments. Add up great decorations (although wattle and daub), indeed transferring you to the grandeur of festivities, pure enjoyment of the physicality and force of knights' jousts, some soft rock accompanying the chain of events, and pack away a very good entertaining movie.Although the pathetic blind father of the main character brought in in the end, as well as pampered Jocelyn, the love interest, ready to elope with HL and &quot;live together with the pigs&quot; undermined my impression and made me take one star down, I'll buy it when it's out, nonetheless.

498810,A1OH2SIJ0U46Q6,B00000F4ZY,"""patsydoc""","[2, 3]","""A Knight's Tale"" was one of those movies that I wasn't too excited about seeing.  I dunno, I just wasn't looking forward to a film that I thought would be chock full of historical inaccuracies punctuated by knights calling each other ""dude"" all set to Queen power ballads.  There was no ""dude"" speak in the film (thank God for that, another ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" we need not) but the ""rock and or roll"" was plentiful and surprisingly complementary.  I have to admit, I did find it a little strange in the first instance--the spectators at the jousting tournament doing the whole ""We will, we will, rock you"" thing.  But once I got used to the fact that this was part of the movie and the director was trying to be innovative I let it go.  ""A Knight's Tale"" is supposed to be a light-hearted adventure not a documentary on medieval knights after all.Anyhoo, the basic premise is about a peasant boy who wants to be a knight-- anyone who's seen the preview can tell you that.  Getting into a little more detail, the story begins with Will (Ledger), Roland (Addy), and Wat (Tudyk) who are introduced as three poor squires to a recently deceased knight who has been competing in a jousting tournament (and must only win one final match to win the tournament).  Caught in this situation, Will convinces Roland and Wat that he can impersonate the knight and complete the tournament in place of the dead knight.  Will wins the match (and the tournament) without being discovered (it is against the law for peasants to compete in the tournaments) and all three squires get a taste of the wealth that can be made by impersonating the knight and set off to the next tournament.Along the way they run into a naked Geoffrey Chaucer (Bettany) who teams up with them and becomes their promoter, a medieval version of Don King.  Chaucer is definitely the best character in the movie and provides a lot of wit and laughs.  The boys team up with a chick blacksmith too...she was a pretty shallow character (like most of the others now that I think about it) but there was only one major thing that bothered me about her.  She made some special armor for Will and she added her own little logo to it, for people to identify her work.....it was two Nike ""swooshes"".  I just thought that was a little ridiculous...but whatever.  Anyway, a little love story goes on between Will and some princess (Princess Jocelyn played by Sossamon) and a little unfriendly competition with (the token bad guy) Count Adhemar (Sewell) results.  But who will win the World Jousting Championship and Princess Jocelyn's heart?  And will Will be found out???  Tune in next week....I mean, see the movie to find out!Recommendation:  This is a fun, fun, fun film.  Shakespeare it ain't but to some people that may be a good thing.  The plot is acceptable, the characters are amusing (except for the Princess-I thought she was annoying), and the jousting action is definitely a large part of the film.  You'll laugh, you may even cry, but you'll definitely be entertained.  It's a good action/adventure movie with a good retro rock `n roll soundtrack.  Better than ""The Mummy Returns"" but not half as good as ""Gladiator"" (but what is?).",3,A Knight's Tale -- Popkorn Junkie's (and my) review,1020124800,"04 30, 2002",2002,3208,"['Knight', 'Tale', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'excited', 'seeing', 'dunno', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'chock', 'full', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'punctuated', 'knights', 'calling', 'other', 'dude', 'set', 'Queen', 'power', 'ballads', 'was', 'dude', 'speak', 'film', 'thank', 'God', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Excellent', 'Adventure', 'need', 'not', 'rock', 'roll', 'was', 'plentiful', 'surprisingly', 'complementary', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'find', 'little', 'strange', 'first', 'instance', 'spectators', 'jousting', 'tournament', 'doing', 'whole', 'will', 'will', 'rock', 'thing', 'once', 'got', 'used', 'fact', 'was', 'part', 'movie', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'innovative', 'let', 'go', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'supposed', 'be', 'light-hearted', 'adventure', 'not', 'documentary', 'medieval', 'knights', 'all.Anyhoo', 'basic', 'premise', 'peasant', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'knight', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'preview', 'can', 'tell', 'Getting', 'little', 'more', 'detail', 'story', 'Will', 'Ledger', 'Roland', 'Addy', 'Wat', 'Tudyk', 'who', 'are', 'introduced', 'three', 'poor', 'squires', 'recently', 'deceased', 'knight', 'who', 'been', 'competing', 'jousting', 'tournament', 'must', 'only', 'win', 'one', 'final', 'match', 'win', 'tournament', 'Caught', 'situation', 'Will', 'Roland', 'Wat', 'can', 'impersonate', 'knight', 'complete', 'tournament', 'place', 'dead', 'knight', 'Will', 'match', 'tournament', 'being', 'discovered', 'law', 'peasants', 'compete', 'tournaments', 'three', 'squires', 'get', 'taste', 'wealth', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'impersonating', 'knight', 'set', 'off', 'next', 'tournament.Along', 'way', 'run', 'naked', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'Bettany', 'who', 'teams', 'up', 'becomes', 'promoter', 'medieval', 'version', 'Don', 'King', 'Chaucer', 'definitely', 'best', 'character', 'movie', 'lot', 'wit', 'boys', 'team', 'up', 'chick', 'blacksmith', 'too', 'was', 'pretty', 'shallow', 'character', 'most', 'others', 'now', 'think', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'major', 'thing', 'bothered', 'made', 'special', 'armor', 'Will', 'added', 'own', 'little', 'logo', 'people', 'identify', 'work', '..it', 'was', 'two', 'swooshes', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'Anyway', 'little', 'love', 'story', 'Will', 'princess', 'Princess', 'Jocelyn', 'played', 'Sossamon', 'little', 'unfriendly', 'competition', 'token', 'bad', 'guy', 'Count', 'Adhemar', 'Sewell', 'results', 'who', 'will', 'win', 'World', 'Jousting', 'Championship', 'Princess', 'Jocelyn', 'heart', 'will', 'Will', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'Tune', 'next', 'week', '.I', 'mean', 'see', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'Recommendation', 'fun', 'fun', 'fun', 'film', 'Shakespeare', 'ai', ""n't"", 'people', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'plot', 'acceptable', 'characters', 'are', 'amusing', 'Princess-I', 'thought', 'was', 'annoying', 'jousting', 'action', 'definitely', 'large', 'part', 'film', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'may', 'even', 'cry', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'entertained', 'good', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'good', 'retro', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'soundtrack', 'Better', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'Gladiator', 'what']",A Knight's Tale

Allegedly the director and producer state on the DVD that they thought it was a good idea to include modern music to show the audience that music then had the same thrust as it did now, but that's a lie.Music then was generated to adorn song which is part of how news was spread. And the crowds at tournaments were more lawless than any American football fan or Scottish or British soccer hooligan. Open nudity, peasants wrestling for money and fighting dirty, the occasional open faced debauchery in public, and so forth, as well as murders and thieving, were part of what being at a medieval tournament were all about. Yet here it's turned into a well organized sporting event. The only thing missing is the giant medieval jumbo-tron.This is a dumb movie. It's an idiotic movie. It's not only detached from reality by several degrees, but the social message isn't even that inventive; i.e. it's okay for guys and girls of different social backgrounds to date and fall in love with one another. Oh gee ... really? Gosh, I guess it's okay for me to think about a variety of women in a variety of erotic situations, which I did already before this piece of garbage was put forth.I'm sorry the late Heath Ledger did this flick, but, well, he did, and I'm sorry it's going to be forever on his resume of films, for in time I think people will come to half heatedly dislike it and acknowledge the garbage that it might have been, but the otherwise luke warm period piece that it is.The one thing that I really applaud the film for is the art direction. The acting, script, and music aside, the film makers did partially capture the era with the sets and costumes. It's too bad there wasn't a better movie to wear the clothes that is the backdrop created by both budget and director.Pass it up.

This movie was an instant cult classic same as the 13th Warrior and the 9th Gate. But I disagree on an earlier comment that the extended DVD is not worth it, untrue. Just my 2 cents.I also recall watching this movie many times when I was feeling down. It was like going on an adventure and the extended edition only made that adventure last that much longer. In the movie the Patriot with Mel Gibson, Heath was excellent but then again, I also loved him in Roar. He was a star from the get go and was probably heading for even greater stardom as the older action stars are slowly exiting stage left, the newer guys are and were moving up, like Heath. It is sad what happened to him. I guess he didn't know himself and his body as well as he thought he did. Drinking, getting high, has it's limits and when you reach those limits, something in you knows exactly what you're doing. In the end, some people cross that line and some don't. I only wish someone was with him and that he wasn't alone, perhaps then he might have been with us today.I personally will continue to watch A Knights Tale until I too exit this great planet. There's nothing to be gained from this except pure enjoyment.**//** - UPDATE:And now Charlton Heston has left us. These are truly sad times as we've lost a great resource, period. It's also sadly a reminder of our own mortality. I mean Heath was not a natural thing and so is treated differently but Charlton lived a long and fruitful life and died of old age with complications.

498820,APBDZ88BBTN4F,B00000F4ZY,R. McAdams,"[1, 2]","This is my favorite Heath Ledger movie he ever did.  It is similar to a standard fantasy tale involving a boy growing up poor, and dreaming big -- until they turn things on their head every now and then (but not in a Mel Brooks sort of way).  For instance, having the herald leading the crowd at the joust in a rousing rendition of Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" was just inspired genius.  They don't break the fantasy illusion too much, and they don't break the 4th wall (as Mel Brooks likes to do), they just sprinkle in a bit of surreal every now and then, to keep you surprised.The basic story is based loosely on ""The Canterbury Tales,"" and ""the story of Ulrich von Lichtenstein"" (according to IMDB).  In it, William (Heath), a poor thatcher's son whose father sacrificed as much as he could to get his son apprenticed to a knight as a squire, in the hopes that the boy could rise above the station he was born into and ""change his stars."" William, unfortunately faces the death of his knight in the middle of a tournament, which means the end of his days pursuing higher station, respect, money and glory.  He decides to impersonate his dead master at the first event -- and he wins.  He then convinces his friends to help him continue to compete.  To do so, he creates a false identity for subsequent events (to prove he is a noble, since only nobles are allowed to compete), with the help of the charming (and often nude due to literally losing everything gambling) Chaucer, played by Paul Bettany (yes, THAT Chaucer is implied who he is).  With the help of his female friend who wants to be taken as a serious blacksmith (Laura Fraser as Kate) and his fellow squires who are in on the deal, Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), they end up going on a grand adventure.Rufus Sewell plays a delicious bad guy by the name of Count Adhemar whom we love to hate, and Shannyn Sossamon plays a believable love interest for William named Jocelyn.  Her interactions with Wat are comedy gold, as well.  Spawning such famous lines as, ""it's called a lance, hellooooo"" and, ""betray us, and I will fong you, until your insides are out, your outsides are in, your entrails will become your entrails I will w-rip... all the p... ung. Pain, lots of pain. "" (quotes from IMDB)The ending is poignant and moving with the Black Prince Edward helping to set the stage for the final showdown between William and Count Adhemar.  Watch it.

Even knowing it was deliberately done for a logical reason doesn't mean that the movie would necessarily turn out to be good... yet it is very good.The story is pretty basic and there really are absolutely no surprises in the plot along the way.  What saves it from being boring is a great cast, good pacing, some very clever banter, exciting joust scenes and some genuinely emotional scenes near the end.The one element that drags the movie down a touch for me is the love sub-plot.  I definitely think the film creators should have gone against convention and had William and Kate get together instead as the scenes between William and Jocelyn seemed to have little chemistry and generally had me waiting for the next scene to begin.However, this movie is one which I almost invariably set on my 'favorites' channel list if I see it on, to switch to during commercials of anything else I'm watching, or sometimes just to watch straight through, for no other reason than it's FUN.There are some truly excellently shot and acted scenes, a few of which I'll mention below (spoilers!!!!)- Geoffrey's nude scene after literally losing his shirt in gambling, and relying on William to bail him out.  The expressions of terrified hope, resignment and relief on Geoffrey's face are perfect.- Any scene with Prince Edward in it.  I really liked the aftermath of the joust between William and Edward and their discussion, plus the whole scene where Edward 'rescues' William later.- The scenes between William and his father, particularly the reunion... even the subtle thing of William looking at the stairs he hadn't seen since he was a child was very well done and somehow immediately made me realize what I think the film creators wanted the audience to feel.- The thin, grey haired noble in the opening 'musical' scene mouthing 'Rock You...'.- The shot of William in the final joust, armor-less, white shirted, lance lashed to his arm is simply one of the most breathtaking images in film.",4,"Shouldn't work, but it does...",1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,2206,"['wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'how', 'movie', 'mixes', 'anachronistic', 'elements', 'medieval', 'times', 'most', 'notably', 'modern', 'day', 'music', 'say', 'creators', 'movie', 'did', 'things', 'deliberate', 'effect', 'Even', 'knowing', 'was', 'deliberately', 'done', 'logical', 'reason', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', 'would', 'necessarily', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'yet', 'very', 'good.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'basic', 'really', 'are', 'absolutely', 'surprises', 'plot', 'way', 'What', 'being', 'boring', 'great', 'cast', 'good', 'pacing', 'very', 'clever', 'banter', 'exciting', 'joust', 'scenes', 'genuinely', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'end.The', 'one', 'element', 'movie', 'down', 'touch', 'love', 'sub-plot', 'definitely', 'think', 'film', 'creators', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'convention', 'had', 'William', 'Kate', 'get', 'together', 'instead', 'scenes', 'William', 'Jocelyn', 'seemed', 'have', 'little', 'chemistry', 'generally', 'had', 'waiting', 'next', 'scene', 'begin.However', 'movie', 'one', 'almost', 'invariably', 'set', ""'favorites"", 'channel', 'list', 'see', 'switch', 'commercials', 'anything', 'else', ""'m"", 'watching', 'sometimes', 'just', 'watch', 'straight', 'other', 'reason', 'FUN.There', 'are', 'truly', 'excellently', 'shot', 'acted', 'scenes', 'few', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'spoilers', 'Geoffrey', 'nude', 'scene', 'literally', 'losing', 'shirt', 'gambling', 'relying', 'William', 'bail', 'out', 'expressions', 'terrified', 'hope', 'resignment', 'relief', 'Geoffrey', 'face', 'are', 'perfect.-', 'Any', 'scene', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'really', 'liked', 'aftermath', 'joust', 'William', 'Edward', 'discussion', 'whole', 'scene', 'where', 'Edward', 'William', 'later.-', 'scenes', 'William', 'father', 'particularly', 'reunion', 'even', 'subtle', 'thing', 'William', 'looking', 'stairs', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'was', 'child', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'somehow', 'immediately', 'made', 'realize', 'what', 'think', 'film', 'creators', 'wanted', 'audience', 'feel.-', 'thin', 'grey', 'haired', 'noble', 'opening', ""'musical"", 'scene', 'mouthing', 'shot', 'William', 'final', 'joust', 'armor-less', 'white', 'shirted', 'lance', 'lashed', 'arm', 'simply', 'one', 'most', 'breathtaking', 'images', 'film']",A Knight's Tale

However, the movie's best function is to remind us of why we DO have rules, because in several areas the film fell flat. We basically saw the ending &quot;climax&quot; of the film actually happen twice - once 20 minutes in and once at the alleged &quot;climax,&quot; which is why the 3-act structure really does work better than whatever this film tried to do. And also because of the strange structure of the film and because of basically poor writing, me and the 2 other people I was with were able to precisely predict *exactly* what the ending of this film would be, only 30 minutes into it.In addition, and this is a matter of opinion only, I did not particularly enjoy watching medieval peasants dance and clap along to &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town.: To use those songs in a film of this type is daring enough, but to actually involve the characters in the songs was distracting. And the costumes were somewhat bizarre too. The female lead usually looked like she was wearing something out of a 1987 Liz Claiborne factory store, and her hair?

He is joined by a wonderful cast of characters, including &quot;Jeff&quot; Chaucer, his &quot;squires,&quot; and a female blacksmith. Other principle characters include William's noble love interest and the wicked Count who is his rival for her affections. Rarely does a film offer so many colorful players.Purists, of course, will not care much for a Knight's Tale given its incorporation of classic rock-and-roll music, but to everyone else, it will most likely be a welcome addition.

Zwick,"[3, 5]","***1/2 It seems that every few years or so Hollywood attempts to revive a moribund genre by coming up with a film that blends traditional elements with those of modern teen movies.  This principle is based on the assumption that, since adolescents provide the source of most of the box office revenue for the industry's few yearly mega-blockbusters, all a studio need do is craft its films in any given genre to reflect that key demographic's interests and it will come up with a winner.  This has been tried, with varying degrees of success, with the western (""Young Guns"") and the swashbuckler (""The Three Musketeers""), to name but a few, and now we have the same principle being applied to the medieval romance in Brian Helgeland's 2001 film, ""A Knight's Tale.""I must confess that I wasn't exactly bowled over by this film in its first hour.  It wasn't that I objected to the filmmakers' use of popular music from the 1970's and `80's as a background for the 14th Century action.  In fact, I rather liked the fact that the film found a unique and interesting way to employ anachronism in a time when audiences seem incapable of identifying with people of the past if they don't speak, act or behave exactly as we do.  No, what I mostly objected to was the fact that the film didn't really seem to know what to do with its concept and that, by the sixth scene of knights jousting, I was pretty much ready to pack up and go home.  Yet, slowly but surely, the film finds both its tone and its footing and becomes an extremely likable romantic tale, overflowing with charm, sentiment and an air of goodwill that becomes quite irresistible.Despite the modern touches around its edges, ""A Knight's Tale"" has solid old-fashioned values at its core.  Heath Ledger stars as William Thatcher, a lowly knight errant who, upon the unexpected death of his master, decides he wants to be a knight himself, even though the law forbids all but nobility and royalty from assuming that title.  Armed with his own band of bumbling, good-natured merry men, Thatcher strikes out to make a name for himself on the jousting circuit, winning the love of the beautiful Jocelyn in the process.  As in most traditional medieval romances, we have blonde, blue-eyed virtue embodied by Thatcher doing battle against dark-haired villainy in the form of the evil Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) - all for the love of a fair lady.""A Knight's Tale"" works because it never takes itself too seriously.  It would be hard for any film to take itself too seriously when it has medieval peasants rocking out to Queen's stadium classic ""We Will Rock You"" at the start of a tournament, elite nobles dancing to David Bowie's ""Golden Years"" at a formal ball, and our heroes re-entering the city of London to the antic strains of Thin Lizzy's ""The Boys are Back in Town"" on the eve of a great jousting contest.  By calling such obvious attention to its anachronisms, the film manages to sustain its youthful, playful spirit throughout.  Even the emphasis on modernistic feminist ideals seems less forced than it otherwise might in a film with a different, more serious tone.  Yet, the film takes its romance very seriously, as evidenced by the fact that the courtship between Thatcher and Jocelyn is played out with an air of genuine affection and sweetness.  Moreover, Roland, Wat, Kate and even Geoffrey Chaucer (yes, THAT Geoffrey Chaucer) serve as wonderful and endearing sidekicks for the intrepid hero.""A Knight's Tale"" is a film that takes a bit of getting used to.

They make enough money to eat by winning at jousting tournaments. When William's knight dies right before his last run in a tournament leaving him and the other two squires with nothing but the promise of empty bellies, William takes his place in order to feed them. He succeeds and it goes to his head. He convinces the other two squires to continue the charade. From tournament to tournament they go pretending that William is of noble birth so that he can compete. Along the way they make friends as well as enemies. In the end they all learn that nobility isn't found on a piece of paper but is instead found in the heart.My Opinion: I found this movie to be awesome! For reasons which I will try to relate, I just love it. The movie opens with an eye rolling scene in which the peasant fans at a jousting match are singing and clapping along to the Queen classic &quot;We will rock you&quot;. I thought I was in for a stinker at this point, but the movie hit its stride instantly after this. Two of the great things about A Knight's Tale are the characters and their relationships. The three main characters William, Roland, and Wat are very likable and their relationship is great. The friendship that they have is very cool and their interaction is very entertaining. When Geoffrey Chaucer is added to make it a foursome, it only gets better. Chaucer is played perfectly by Paul Bettany. He is instantly likable and adds color to every scene he is in. Next we get Kate, the female blacksmith trying to make it in a male dominated profession and world. She adds depth to the group of friends. The camaraderie between this team spilled off the screen and infected me. As for the bad guy, he's just bad enough. This may sound simple, but it's so often mishandled. He's not a buffoon, and he's not so evil that it throws the entire balance of the movie off. He's well done.  The plot is also something that is very easy to screw up. In A Knight's Tale, the plot is also well done. There is a well defined conflict, and goal. The story steadily moves forward toward the goal and a resolution of the conflict. Nothing too bad happens to the heroes and the villain doesn't get the upper hand for too long. All this sounds simple, but any one of them can ruin a movie. Here they all serve to make it better. Finally, and probably most importantly, it's entertaining. It grabbed a hold of me and didn't let go. I went right out and bought the DVD after watching the rental one because I had to have it in my collection.DVD Quality: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 with excellent video quality, Sound is DD5.1.

Okay, I thought, they took modern music and set it to the movie. Pretty absurd, but it might be cool. Then as they showed the audience and I thought it couldn't get any crazier, I noticed they were actually singing it! This film doesn't simply try to modernize itself by throwing in twentieth century pop-culture, it actually incorporates it. At one point, someone says ""Can I get a shout-out for London!"" About the only thing they didn't do in this film was have anyone ""raise the roof!"" Yet surprisingly enough, all of this campiness works and provides for a fun and entertaining movie.After about 20 minutes, you begin to accept the campiness of the film and enjoy it. You realize how absurd it is, but just don't care. The director took a huge gamble with these ideas, but I think it pays off well. You just need to get over the historical inacuracies and corniness of a Knight's Tale and enjoy. Most people in the theater were laughing with the film, not at it.While not the greatest film ever made, it certainly is a successful one, and provides for an entertaining picture that many should enjoy.

498844,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B00000F4ZY,Steffan Piper,"[11, 13]","Well ... a good seven years has now passed since this film was in the theatres and it holds up just as fine as it did the very first time I saw it.The Reception ...The first and most striking aspect of this film was the amount of antipathy that was generated by Carter Burwell's insightful use of modern music in a period comedy /drama. Unfortunately this created so much backlash, and so much hatred amongst the viewers that hordes of haters flocked to the internet to post hundreds of pages of comments on IMDb, and post an unflattering number of continuous negative reviews on Amazon for years to come with a long sea of comments regarding the `egregiousness' of what this film did to the period. None of the `paid, real-life' Reviewers were any kinder to writer / director Brian Helgeland as well and just about every reviewer couldn't tolerate the opening of peasants drumming away and singing `We Will Rock You' or Heath Ledger practicing his technique to War's `Lowrider'. So many viewers would have a better understanding and greater perspective on stuff like this if they would just acquaint themselves with theworkof Tom Stoppard. His work in the field of Victorian and Middle-age shenanigans has made absurdist theatre what it is today and has shaped a lot of modern film.""It's called a lance, hello ...""The Controversy ...Some people may remember that the negative reviews were so many, that some bright spark over at Sony Pictures decided to start fabricating positive reviews and using quotes for those fake reviews to advertise the film. Well, someone noticed and caught them with their proverbial hand in the cookie jar. Yes, there was a lawsuit and someone got paid. Whoever that was, is beyond me because I never saw a dime of that money and I saw it twice in the theatre and I've purchased both versions available on DVD.For almost five years, someone also hosted a phony website that was made to emulate an Anchorage area High School up in Alaska, which regarded a supposed Musical adaptation of `A Knights Tale', replete with fake newspaper reviews, fake still photographs and other phony productions also complete with posters, banners and photographs. The website was taken down in 2006 after it was finally discovered by Sony Pictures and they didn't find the joke very funny at all.The Writer / Director and Shannyn Sossamon ...A lot of people, who were in charge of production and had financially backed the picture were ecstatic to be working with prolific Writer / Director Brian Helgeland, who had previously had much success with the magnificent filmL.A. Confidential. Whether one likes that movie or not, it surely is a screenplay to rival all others in scope and skill. No dailies were made available during filming as principal photography took place in the Czech Republic, but nobody seemed to mind as they were all fully behind Helgeland's ""period epic"" that would be a sort-of screen adaptation of Geoffrey Chaucer'sCanterbury Tales. There must have been an incredible silence during the first few screenings when they finally got to see the finished product. The problem was that even though the marketing campaign for the film was vast and appropriate, too much negative banter behind the scenes got the ball rolling on all the bad reviews. But in truth, it still did pretty good in the theatres and very well once released on DVD, both times. To this day, a lot of people adore this film and it's quickly becoming a real cult-classic and not the kind of cult-classic that Studios likes to advertise their poorly made films like Superbad as. A Knights Tale really is a cult-classic, that status is not something placed upon it by the Studios, but attributed to it by the fans and the continued viewership.Unfortunately though for Helgeland, his career as a director hasn't ever really improved, has it? He's seemingly stuck forever with his Cirque du Freak vampire movie that no one has yet seen a frame of. His writing though hasn't suffered as he's penned numerous hits that have been critically acclaimed such asMystic River, andMan on Fire. He was also a guest commentator on the recent DVD re-release ofThe Omenalongside Richard Donner. Note to reader: the Omen commentary is well worth listening to and will give you a deeper respect for Richard Donner after hearing it.And then there was Shannyn Sossamon. A nice young girl who went out for general auditions for this film, and who at the time was working as a (gasp!) Stripper in a Los Angeles area all-nude Strip Club. I promise you this ... I never met her. In the commentary, Helgeland makes mention of this and jokes that he intentionally put her name in the opening credits superimposed over a young-girl dancing because of that fact. It was a bit harsh, I thought and I couldn't help but detect some jilted emotion in his voice as well. She also shows up as the object of the writer's affection in the movieThe Order, with a few other members of this cast in a story that is just overwrought with the pangs of deprized love and has a serious undercurrent of a Sossamon infatuation.So I guess, Helgeland truly has been weighed, measured and found wanting as a director. The future is all his though. Hopefully, whatever he does next will be openly accepted, even if it is anotherA Knight's Tale.Heath Ledger ...For years on Amazon, the bulk of recent reviews for A Knights Tale were all negative as I stated before, and there was a lot of conversation about the historical accuracy. Now that Heath has passed, I guess it's only appropriate that all that is now in the past and people now post reviews saying how much they loved him and what an impact as an actor he made on film and their lives. It's fine and probably well-deserved. He was taken too early through working himself into an exhaustion and getting caught in a spiraling set of circumstances that went out of control.I probably owe Heath a debt of gratitude as for a period of time, I was often mistaken for him in public. Being a Los Angeles area resident, it did get me a few girls during the late night outings. But trust me, no one ever believed fully that I was him. The timing was good too, as it was a dark period for me and I needed everything I could get back then just to keep going. So, posthumously ... thanks, Heath. I owe ya one, mate.His performance in this film quite good, and full of life and hopefully this is how people will remember him as I feel it was one of his most enjoyable roles in film. The Joker will probably be seen as equally good even though the polar opposite in emotion and intensity.Alan Tudyk and the rest of cast ...It was this film that introduced me to the American Actor Alan Tudyk. A native of Plano, Texas whose acting is so good, could get himself cast in a film with a fake accent and do a more than passable job as an Englishman named Wot Falhurst. Great name, by the way.A story about `Geoff' Chaucer is intriguing enough by itself.""I will eviscerate you in fiction. I was naked for a day, you will be naked for eternity.""A much-overlooked, but incredibly well-written piece of cinema. Anyone who could write something like that, does not need a lecture on historical accuracy. Lots of films and movies are made about historical figures, but the most shameful thing that is too-often done -- is the dialogue that is placed in their mouths. It is often out-of-place, inaccurate, buffoonish and abysmal. Helgeland wrote so many incredibly moving, witty and interesting lines for Geoffrey Chaucer that would make one think that he will one day revisit the character and give him the honor of a feature length film, or at least a screenplay. Paul Bettany's performance with the line ...""Lillium Interspinus ... the Lilly among the thorns.""Is a fantastic piece of impromptu acting and a great introduction during the film.As for Rufus Sewell, a lot of people used to associate him with the cult sci-fi masterpiece Dark City, now I can't look at him without thinking of his role as Adhemar of Anjou and that scowling cock-eyed look of his. You'd be cock-eyed too, if you boozed it up and partied as heavily and heartily as this guy did. My God, he was a Hollywood legend for years at after parties, wrap-parties, clubs, you name it. His reputation as an animal far outweighed his reputation as an actor.A historical note ...Yeah, too many other reviewers make mention of the dates, the Black Prince, the real Ulrich of Gelderland and on and on. A long list of accusations is still up for the reading over at IMDb if anyone is interested. If you're really interested in why a lot of this was done, then just listen to the commentary on the DVD with Paul Bettany and Brian Helgeland and you learn more about this film, and be the better for it.We walk in the garden of his turpluence ...

498851,A2CZR46KVZLWDT,B00000F4ZY,Suzie,"[0, 1]","It's the middle of the Fourteenth Century; the tail end of the middle ages, and jousting (a violent sport, that basically involves two men trying to skewer each other with huge poles, while on horseback) is the equivalent of football.Will Thatcher (Heath Ledger) and his friends Roland and Watt are servants to a knight who regularly competes in these competitions. However, in the first scene of the movie Will and Roland find him dead under a tree. Desperate for the money their knight's win would have provided them, the three young men decide that Will will compete under the dead knight's name (which is risky because if he were found out, the consequences would be serious). However, Will wins and the friends decide to spend their money, training Will to joust, the goal being Will eventually competing in a tournament.Will goes to the first tournament under a false name, impersonating a nobleman with the help of Geoffrey Chaucer (yes, the same Geoffrey Chaucer who wrote `The Canterbury Tales'). He soon meets the beautiful Jocelyn who is unrealistically played by Shannyn Sossamon. Although pretty in modern times, anyone as dark-skinned and anemic looking as Sossamon not have been considered worth a second glance in the 14th century, and she wears ridiculously modern clothes on top of that.Will also makes an enemy of Count Adhemar of Anjou, played with convincing arrogance by Rufus Sewell. Adhemar, who never accepts less than the best for himself, has set his sights both on winning every tournament and marrying Jocelyn. As Will is his only competition in both arenas, their dislike for each other is mutual.For what it is, this movie is pretty good. I could have done without all the classic rock in medieval England, but it was an original choice of music all the same.Ledger is one of the actors who is never outstandingly good or egregiously bad, so there isn't much to be said either way for his performance - except that it was in no way a stretch for him. Sossomon wasn't terrible in a technical sense, but something about the way she portrayed a character, who was a tad annoying anyway, drove me up the wall. The best performances were definitely those of Rufus Sewell and Paul Bettany, but they also had the most interesting characters. Sewell (who I had never seen in a movie before) was excellent as an infuriatingly overconfident and sadistic nobleman, and Bettany (whose character was an interesting inclusion in the gauntlet of types of medieval people) was realistic as a zealous and crowd-pleasing speaker.I give it three stars, because although it lacked quite a bit, it was entertaining and somehow hard not to like.",3,Halfway to Good,1059177600,"07 26, 2003",2003,2654,"['middle', 'Fourteenth', 'Century', 'tail', 'end', 'middle', 'ages', 'jousting', 'violent', 'sport', 'basically', 'two', 'men', 'trying', 'skewer', 'other', 'huge', 'poles', 'horseback', 'equivalent', 'football.Will', 'Thatcher', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'friends', 'Roland', 'Watt', 'are', 'servants', 'knight', 'who', 'regularly', 'competitions', 'However', 'first', 'scene', 'movie', 'Will', 'Roland', 'find', 'dead', 'tree', 'Desperate', 'money', 'knight', 'win', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'three', 'young', 'men', 'decide', 'Will', 'will', 'compete', 'dead', 'knight', 'name', 'risky', 'were', 'found', 'out', 'consequences', 'would', 'be', 'serious', 'However', 'Will', 'friends', 'decide', 'spend', 'money', 'training', 'Will', 'joust', 'goal', 'being', 'Will', 'eventually', 'competing', 'tournament.Will', 'first', 'tournament', 'false', 'name', 'impersonating', 'nobleman', 'help', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'yes', 'same', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'who', 'wrote', 'Canterbury', 'Tales', 'soon', 'beautiful', 'Jocelyn', 'who', 'unrealistically', 'played', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'pretty', 'modern', 'times', 'anyone', 'dark-skinned', 'anemic', 'looking', 'Sossamon', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'second', 'glance', '14th', 'century', 'ridiculously', 'modern', 'clothes', 'top', 'that.Will', 'also', 'enemy', 'Count', 'Adhemar', 'Anjou', 'played', 'convincing', 'arrogance', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Adhemar', 'who', 'never', 'less', 'best', 'set', 'sights', 'winning', 'tournament', 'marrying', 'Jocelyn', 'As', 'Will', 'only', 'competition', 'arenas', 'dislike', 'other', 'mutual.For', 'what', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'classic', 'rock', 'medieval', 'England', 'was', 'original', 'choice', 'music', 'same.Ledger', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'never', 'outstandingly', 'good', 'egregiously', 'bad', ""n't"", 'much', 'be', 'said', 'way', 'performance', 'was', 'way', 'stretch', 'Sossomon', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'technical', 'sense', 'something', 'way', 'portrayed', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'tad', 'annoying', 'anyway', 'drove', 'up', 'wall', 'best', 'performances', 'were', 'definitely', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'also', 'had', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Sewell', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'infuriatingly', 'overconfident', 'sadistic', 'nobleman', 'Bettany', 'character', 'was', 'interesting', 'inclusion', 'gauntlet', 'types', 'medieval', 'people', 'was', 'realistic', 'zealous', 'crowd-pleasing', 'speaker.I', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'lacked', 'quite', 'bit', 'was', 'entertaining', 'somehow', 'hard', 'not', 'like']",A Knight's Tale
498852,A4NXA2IJNE10H,B00000F4ZY,"Tetsu Uma ""The 'Iron Horse'""","[2, 4]","Here is my disclaimer - DON'T TAKE THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY.  I have to admit, when I first saw A Knight's Tale, at first I was a bit put off by the glaring historical inaccuracies and rock music.  That is I was until I saw the scene where the herald, Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany), is getting the crowd fired up prior to a match and it all made perfect sense - Jousting as PRO WRESTLING!  What the director and writers have done is a satire, putting the features and passion of pro wrestling (and other fan favorite sports like football) into a medieval setting.Not to completely rehash the plot, the story is a basic, Horatio Alger rags to riches story.  William (Hugh Ledger) is a commoner serving as page for Sir Hector, an aging knight who dies of a heart attack during the course of a tournament.  Out of funds, William dons Sir Hector's armor and finishes the tournament.  This victory inspires William to try to make a living impersonating a knight.  He convinces Sir Hector's other pages, Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), to join him and with practice, they become successful on the ""Jousting circuit"" with William creation, ""Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.""  Along the way, William defeats the heavy, Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell), gets the girl (Jocelyn - played by Shannyn Sossamon), and wins the Jousting Championship.The dialogue is average (although Bellamy shines in the role of the herald) and the directing is adequate (I did like the shots of the jousting) but the real fun in this film is the satire and the music.  The musical selection, such as ""Golden Years"" by David Bowie for the dancing scene or the choice of ""The Boys are Back in Town"" by (Irish) band ""Thin Lizzy"" for the return to London scene really capture the spirit of the action on the screen.  Other details such as the Nike ""Swoosh"" on the armor just add to the ""don't take this too seriously"" tone.I suppose from looking at what others have written, this is a love it or hate it film.

498857,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00000F4ZY,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 13]","William Thatcher (Heath Ledger) is the aide to a well-known knight. On the verge of winning a tournament, the knight dies, leaving William and the knight's other assistants, Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk) desperate. They haven't eaten in three days and need the prize money to fill their stomachs. Will takes the knight's place and wins the tournament. They decide that Will should pose as a knight and compete in other tournaments. Only noblemen are allowed to complete and Will is anything but noble. Along the way, they run across Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany), who then tags along for the ride. Geoff, as his friends call him, becomes a sort of ringside announcer, revving the crowd up for each of William's appearances.""A Knight's Tale"" is an interesting mess from writer- director Brian Helgeland. The success of just about every movie relies on the ability of the audience to suspend a certain amount of disbelief. In order for that to happen, the film has to have a certain amount of reality. ""A Knight's Tale"" has little, if any, basis in reality. I didn't buy it.The first joust is preceded by every one in the audience stamping their fists and singing along to Robbie Williams and Queen singing ""We Will Rock You"". It was an interesting idea, in the trailers and commercials, but to have 14th century people singing along to a rock song is just stupid. Throughout the rest of the film, the 20th century music is played in the background to little effect.We have all heard of films based in the past in which their were historical inaccuracies. Cowboys wearing wrist watches, roman soldiers wearing tennis shoes, etc. There have even been modern day reinterpretations of stories set in the past. Baz Luhrman's 'Romeo+Juliet' is a good example. ""A Knight's Tale"" does neither, falling somewhere in between. Frequently, the characters spout 20th century jargon, yet also continue to speak in a style that most people would buy as 14th century England. Why bother with the antiquated speech at all? If you want to have someone say 'Hello, it's called a lance' in the way that people do, to indicate something should be obvious, or to say 'Yes', in a way to indicate that they are pleased, why bother trying to make the characters seem as though they have walked out of a Shakespeare play. It is inconsistent and dumb.Geoff Chaucer becomes a sort of ancient WWF ringside announcer. Dumb.Jocelyn, played by Shannyn Sossamon, seems to be a sort of jousting groupie. Her role at these events is never really explained. Why is she popping up at these events? Will, of course, sets his eyes on her, and she returns the favors.The jousting scenes are interesting, but the characters lack believability and interest, causing us to find nothing to identify with.Ultimately, the film plays like a live-action version of the classic Bugs Bunny cartoon 'Knighty Night Bugs'. Bugs is having his ears done and gets hit on the head by an apple, transporting him back to Medieval times. There, he has trouble blending in, using 20th century phrases, until he realizes that he should start using phrases like 'Here sooth'. Ultimately, he jousts the Black Knight (sounds very familiar). After he talks about his friends including  the 'Count of Basie'. He is hit on the head again and returns to the present day.I felt like I was hit on the head by an apple.",2,Knighty Knight Bugs,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,3358,"['William', 'Thatcher', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'aide', 'well-known', 'knight', 'verge', 'winning', 'tournament', 'knight', 'leaving', 'William', 'knight', 'other', 'assistants', 'Roland', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'Wat', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'desperate', 'have', ""n't"", 'eaten', 'three', 'days', 'need', 'prize', 'money', 'fill', 'stomachs', 'Will', 'knight', 'place', 'tournament', 'decide', 'Will', 'should', 'pose', 'knight', 'compete', 'other', 'tournaments', 'Only', 'noblemen', 'are', 'allowed', 'complete', 'Will', 'anything', 'noble', 'way', 'run', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'who', 'then', 'ride', 'Geoff', 'friends', 'call', 'sort', 'ringside', 'announcer', 'revving', 'crowd', 'up', 'William', 'appearances', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'interesting', 'mess', 'writer-', 'director', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'success', 'just', 'movie', 'ability', 'audience', 'suspend', 'certain', 'amount', 'disbelief', 'order', 'happen', 'film', 'have', 'certain', 'amount', 'reality', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'little', 'basis', 'reality', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'it.The', 'first', 'joust', 'preceded', 'one', 'audience', 'stamping', 'fists', 'singing', 'along', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'Queen', 'singing', 'Will', 'Rock', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'trailers', 'commercials', 'have', '14th', 'century', 'people', 'singing', 'along', 'rock', 'song', 'just', 'stupid', 'rest', 'film', '20th', 'century', 'music', 'played', 'background', 'little', 'effect.We', 'have', 'heard', 'films', 'based', 'past', 'were', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'Cowboys', 'wearing', 'wrist', 'watches', 'roman', 'soldiers', 'wearing', 'tennis', 'shoes', 'etc', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'modern', 'day', 'reinterpretations', 'stories', 'set', 'past', 'Baz', 'Luhrman', ""'Romeo+Juliet"", 'good', 'example', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'falling', 'somewhere', 'Frequently', 'characters', 'spout', '20th', 'century', 'jargon', 'yet', 'also', 'continue', 'speak', 'style', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'buy', '14th', 'century', 'England', 'Why', 'bother', 'antiquated', 'speech', 'want', 'have', 'someone', 'say', ""'Hello"", 'called', 'lance', 'way', 'people', 'do', 'indicate', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'say', ""'Yes"", 'way', 'indicate', 'are', 'pleased', 'why', 'bother', 'trying', 'make', 'characters', 'seem', 'have', 'walked', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'inconsistent', 'dumb.Geoff', 'Chaucer', 'sort', 'ancient', 'WWF', 'ringside', 'announcer', 'Dumb.Jocelyn', 'played', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'be', 'sort', 'jousting', 'groupie', 'role', 'events', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'Why', 'popping', 'up', 'events', 'Will', 'course', 'eyes', 'favors.The', 'jousting', 'scenes', 'are', 'interesting', 'characters', 'lack', 'believability', 'interest', 'causing', 'find', 'nothing', 'identify', 'with.Ultimately', 'film', 'plays', 'live-action', 'version', 'classic', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'cartoon', 'Night', 'Bugs', 'Bugs', 'having', 'ears', 'done', 'hit', 'head', 'apple', 'transporting', 'back', 'Medieval', 'times', 'trouble', 'blending', 'using', '20th', 'century', 'phrases', 'should', 'start', 'using', 'phrases', ""'Here"", 'sooth', 'Ultimately', 'Black', 'Knight', 'very', 'familiar', 'friends', 'including', ""'Count"", 'Basie', 'hit', 'head', 'again', 'returns', 'present', 'day.I', 'felt', 'was', 'hit', 'head', 'apple']",A Knight's Tale

He decides to try to make a living out of it. He runs into Geoffery Chaucer who he pays to fake a aristocrat background. (Only the nobs can compete)The main plot of the film is based around a rivalry between the hero played by Heath Ledger and a villian with a German name. Bound up in the rivalary over who is the best at jousting is a desire to wed the female lead.The film is strange the way it interweaves pop music and jousting performances and the female lead who dresses in contempory clothing.

I spent the entire movie in a state of awe that so much money and so many people would be involved in producing such a specimen of utter confusion.A Knight's Tale is Blazing Saddles meets Excalibur meets Shakespeare in Love.  Underneath all of the wild production choices is a fairly good script.  Young peasant William [Heath Ledger] disguises himself as a knight to win jousting tournaments, trying to win enough money to-as he puts it-""change my stars."" The movie was well-cast and the acting was good.  Mark Addy (who played Dave in the Full Monty) was particularly believable as Roland, the earnest and loyal sidekick. With a team of companions and a beautiful love interest and a villain who threatens to bring the whole enterprise down, it could have worked.Where it falls apart is in the anachronistic production choices.  As young William approaches the first jousting field, onlookers clap in rhythm to Queen's anthem ""We Will Rock You.""  As the crane shot moves closer to specific extras, you see them rocking out, dancing disco, singing along with the soundtrack.  It's a very Mel Brooks moment, and so you settle in and laugh a little and think ""ah, Space Balls Middle Ages.  I get it.""And then the film gets serious.  Twenty minutes later all the anachronisms are gone, but you've been unsettled enough by them that you're looking for satire throughout the film.  Scenes which could have been touching are ruined.  Occasionally you hear a half-familiar line, or see a half-familiar camera shot, and you think you're watching a very subtle satire, perhaps a send-up of the whole movie industry.  But you never can quite put your finger on what it is they're trying to satirize.  So-if you're me and you've spent the whole movie wondering ""what the heck was Brian Helgeland thinking?!?""-you go to the director's commentary on the DVD expecting some answers.The only answer I got from the first ten minutes of the commentary was:  he wasn't.  The director's commentary sounds more like two old college buddies rehashing old times about people you never knew than any serious reflection on the approach to production.  In retrospect, A Knight's Tale seemed like 100 scenes in search of a movie, and I feel generous giving it two stars.",2,"Satire, Swords and Sewage",1028419200,"08 4, 2002",2002,2715,"['scene', 'Big', 'Chill', 'where', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', ""'re"", 'so', 'analytical', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'have', 'let', 'art', 'flow', 'watching', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'friend', 'turned', 'said', 'art', 'right', 'down', 'sewer', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'excrement', 'However', 'would', 'say', 'tonal', 'inconsistencies', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'extreme', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'enter', 'story', 'spent', 'entire', 'movie', 'state', 'awe', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'involved', 'producing', 'such', 'specimen', 'utter', 'confusion.A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'meets', 'Excalibur', 'meets', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Underneath', 'wild', 'production', 'choices', 'fairly', 'good', 'script', 'Young', 'peasant', 'William', '[', 'Heath', 'Ledger', ']', 'knight', 'win', 'jousting', 'tournaments', 'trying', 'win', 'enough', 'money', 'to-as', 'it-', 'change', 'stars', 'movie', 'was', 'well-cast', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'who', 'played', 'Dave', 'Full', 'Monty', 'was', 'particularly', 'believable', 'Roland', 'earnest', 'loyal', 'sidekick', 'team', 'companions', 'beautiful', 'love', 'interest', 'villain', 'who', 'bring', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'down', 'could', 'have', 'worked.Where', 'apart', 'anachronistic', 'production', 'choices', 'young', 'William', 'first', 'jousting', 'field', 'onlookers', 'clap', 'rhythm', 'Queen', 'anthem', 'Will', 'Rock', 'crane', 'shot', 'moves', 'closer', 'specific', 'extras', 'see', 'rocking', 'out', 'dancing', 'disco', 'singing', 'along', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'moment', 'so', 'settle', 'little', 'think', 'ah', 'Space', 'Balls', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'get', 'then', 'film', 'serious', 'Twenty', 'minutes', 'later', 'anachronisms', 'are', 'gone', ""'ve"", 'been', 'unsettled', 'enough', ""'re"", 'looking', 'satire', 'film', 'Scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'touching', 'are', 'ruined', 'Occasionally', 'hear', 'half-familiar', 'line', 'see', 'half-familiar', 'camera', 'shot', 'think', ""'re"", 'watching', 'very', 'subtle', 'satire', 'perhaps', 'send-up', 'whole', 'movie', 'industry', 'never', 'can', 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'what', ""'re"", 'trying', 'satirize', 'So-if', ""'re"", ""'ve"", 'spent', 'whole', 'movie', 'wondering', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'thinking', '-you', 'go', 'director', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'expecting', 'answers.The', 'only', 'got', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'commentary', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'director', 'commentary', 'more', 'two', 'old', 'college', 'buddies', 'rehashing', 'old', 'times', 'people', 'never', 'knew', 'serious', 'reflection', 'approach', 'production', 'retrospect', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'seemed', '100', 'scenes', 'search', 'movie', 'feel', 'generous', 'giving', 'two', 'stars']",A Knight's Tale

The story centers around a young man's desire to prove himself and his worth regardless of his social place and birth.William is the son of a peasant thatcher, squired to a knight. While making the jousting tournament rounds, the knight dies. William takes his place, assumes an alias and proceeds to set the circuit on fire with his bravery and skill. His companions, including a young Chaucer, aid him in this adventure, culminating in a world championship tournement in London...It is a light farcical fairy tale with plenty of music, humor and overacting.

I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of Geoffrey Chaucer, roving poet and wit, who finds himself employed as Herald to our hero Knight with amusing effect.  The film moves along at a fair pace and keeps the level of action and interest high as well as bringing in a frisson of romance.
