Because it has more emotional impact in it, and it has really funny scenes like the &quot;feeling emotions on faces&quot; the original has. The &quot;battle of wills&quot; is more tame in this (the Disney version) one than the original. I've noticed they left out some really good scenes that was from the original.This version from Disney is ok. The actress who played Anne Sullivan did good, but I like the original James (Helen's half-brother) better than this one. The little girl who played Helen in this version is not as good as Patty Duke, but she did well.If I had a choice, I'd pick the original.

569884,A2NLDZ1ISQV2Z7,B000056MOF,Grace,"[11, 13]","Ok, so maybe it doesn't have the same spark as the original &quot;Miracle Worker&quot; with Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft did, but it worked. There was nothing wrong with this movie. It's an extremely sensitive retelling of the classic story of a deaf, blind and mute little girl who learned to communicate through the tireless teachings of Annie Sullivan. This version was VERY different, and the acting was not quite as passionate as it was in the original movie, but what can I say? I still loved it. Hallie Kate Eisenberg is, without a doubt, absolutely adorable and Alison Elliott does an excellent job in her role as Ms. Sullivan. I do have to admit that it was quite a stretch to see Eisenberg, whom we all recognize as &quot;The Pepsi Girl,&quot; taking on such a complex role. Portraying Helen Keller has got to be extremely difficult, and I'm sure many people feel that Eisenberg wasn't able to pull it off. But in my opinion, she did fine in the role. This movie profiles a more prim and graceful Helen who wears pretty dresses with laces and fancy shoes. It's quite a difference from Patty Duke and her more raggedy wardrobe, but who cares? They obviously wanted to give Helen Keller a different sort of style this time around, and hey, it works. And it isn't the clothes that matter in this case--it's the way the story is told. And this movie doesn't stretch or deface the facts, so it's good. Of course, this version didn't outdo the original--I have a hard time believing that anyone would expect it to, anyway. But that's not the point. This is merely just a modern-day retelling of a true story. Maybe this is the type of story that many people believe isn't a story of &quot;sensitivity,&quot; but sensitivity  is undoubtedly important. While the 1962 version was absolutely outstanding, there wasn't as much sensitivity in it as there could have been. This new version has more of that, and that's good. Eisenberg made the ending of the movie a thoroughly touching and unforgettable one. I liked seeing Mrs. Keller (Helen's mother) as a gentle woman who really flaunts her incredible amount of love for Helen. Helen's father, Captain James, was very tough and headstrong, and for some reason, that was the image I had painted in my head of Helen's father. Jimmy--the stepbrother of Helen--is charming, and the actor who played this character did a great job. It warmed my heart to see this young, hurting man guide his father to a transformation from anger to understanding. Basically, if you want to see a version of &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; with basic historical accuracy and a fair share of sensitivity, then by all means buy this 2000 version. It doesn't equal the 1962 masterpiece that we all know and love, but it is still very good. It's also a WONDERFUL way to introduce younger children to the story of Helen Keller. The script is simple and straightforward, so if you are one of those people who does not know the story, this is a great movie to help you become better acquainted with Helen's unforgettable conversion to light and knowledge. My advice? Buy the movie--what's the harm? Just buy it and enjoy seeing a new version of the story.",4,This movie works,1009497600,"12 28, 2001",2001,3176,"['Ok', 'so', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'spark', 'original', 'quot', 'Miracle', 'Worker', 'quot', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'did', 'worked', 'was', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'retelling', 'classic', 'story', 'deaf', 'blind', 'mute', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'learned', 'communicate', 'tireless', 'teachings', 'Annie', 'Sullivan', 'version', 'was', 'VERY', 'different', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'passionate', 'was', 'original', 'movie', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'still', 'loved', 'Hallie', 'Kate', 'Eisenberg', 'doubt', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'Alison', 'Elliott', 'excellent', 'job', 'role', 'Ms.', 'Sullivan', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'quite', 'stretch', 'see', 'Eisenberg', 'whom', 'recognize', 'quot', 'Pepsi', 'Girl', 'quot', 'taking', 'complex', 'role', 'Portraying', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'got', 'be', 'extremely', 'difficult', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'feel', 'Eisenberg', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'opinion', 'did', 'fine', 'role', 'movie', 'more', 'prim', 'graceful', 'Helen', 'who', 'pretty', 'dresses', 'laces', 'fancy', 'shoes', 'quite', 'difference', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'more', 'raggedy', 'wardrobe', 'who', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'give', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'different', 'sort', 'style', 'time', 'hey', ""n't"", 'clothes', 'matter', 'case', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'movie', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'deface', 'facts', 'good', 'course', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'outdo', 'original', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'anyone', 'would', 'expect', 'anyway', 'not', 'point', 'merely', 'just', 'modern-day', 'retelling', 'true', 'story', 'Maybe', 'type', 'story', 'many', 'people', 'believe', ""n't"", 'story', 'quot', 'sensitivity', 'quot', 'sensitivity', 'undoubtedly', 'important', '1962', 'version', 'was', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'sensitivity', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'new', 'version', 'more', 'good', 'Eisenberg', 'made', 'ending', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'touching', 'unforgettable', 'one', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Mrs.', 'Keller', 'Helen', 'mother', 'gentle', 'woman', 'who', 'really', 'incredible', 'amount', 'love', 'Helen', 'Helen', 'father', 'Captain', 'James', 'was', 'very', 'tough', 'headstrong', 'reason', 'was', 'image', 'had', 'painted', 'head', 'Helen', 'father', 'Jimmy', 'stepbrother', 'Helen', 'charming', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'character', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'warmed', 'heart', 'see', 'young', 'hurting', 'man', 'guide', 'father', 'transformation', 'anger', 'understanding', 'Basically', 'want', 'see', 'version', 'quot', 'Miracle', 'Worker', 'quot', 'basic', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'fair', 'share', 'sensitivity', 'then', 'means', 'buy', '2000', 'version', ""n't"", 'equal', '1962', 'masterpiece', 'know', 'love', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'WONDERFUL', 'way', 'introduce', 'younger', 'children', 'story', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'script', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'so', 'are', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'story', 'great', 'movie', 'help', 'become', 'better', 'acquainted', 'Helen', 'unforgettable', 'conversion', 'light', 'knowledge', 'advice', 'Buy', 'movie', 'what', 'harm', 'Just', 'buy', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'new', 'version', 'story']",The Miracle Worker VHS

Afterall the story of Annie Sullivan teaching Helen Keller communication is timeless and the 1979 version does prove that remakes can still work. So, if they had to do another one two decades later, why cast the Pepsi Girl in the coveted role as Helen?? I read a review that said her emotionless performance should be nicknamed &quot;Frankenkeller&quot;, because she does indeed walk around like a robot! The only good thing about her performance is that she doesn't talk in the film! She is also too graceful a Helen. Patty Duke, and even Melissa Gilbert had a more wild animal like energy to their performances, while Ms. Pepsi seems bored as Helen (or is it that we are just bored at watching her? Would someone give her a Pepsi, please?? I was totally shocked that she didn't start singing at the pivotal water pump scene &quot;The Joy of Wa-Wa&quot;! However, she didn't say anything at all! Where is the emotional wallup that that scene has always brought to us?!On some postive notes: The sets are grand and so are the costumes.

I agree with another customer that remakes can be better than originals, but I do not think that this remake is.  There is a remarkable performance by the girl playing Helen Keller, but otherwise the acting does not seem as strong.  This movie is both in color and very colorful, which distinctly seems the wrong cinematic choice.  For either version, however, a reading of Hellen Keller's own book, _The Story of My Life_, will help explain what the movie attempts to dramatize, especially the final scene at the water pump.",3,A reading of Hellen Keller's book is recommended,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,654,"['Having', 'recently', 'seen', '1962', 'version', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'forced', 'see', 'production', 'inferior', 'so', 'far', 'agree', 'customer', 'remakes', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'originals', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'remake', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'girl', 'playing', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'otherwise', 'acting', 'not', 'seem', 'strong', 'movie', 'color', 'very', 'colorful', 'distinctly', 'wrong', 'cinematic', 'choice', 'version', 'however', 'reading', 'Hellen', 'Keller', 'own', 'book', '_The', 'Story', 'My', 'Life_', 'will', 'help', 'explain', 'what', 'movie', 'dramatize', 'especially', 'final', 'scene', 'water', 'pump']",The Miracle Worker VHS

Most of the time that's a good thing, but not so much in the case of this movie. The old one starring Patty Duke was much better in the respect of cast. Everyone CLASHED -- and that was a GOOD thing because it was half the conflict, which is a vital ellement in any movie. Also, Patty Duke was a Helen with a broader range of emotion. This new one is 1)Blank, or 2)Sour. And Lucas Black as James?! I like him, but he was NOT the guy for the role. I much prefer the sarcastic, withdrawn, hurting young man in the 1960's movie. He wanted to be loved and accepted for himself, but was much too proud to stoop to whining or openly pointing out his father's favoritism. Yes, these new characters are definately modulated.

The acting is stiff and although the cast is well-known, the acting, except for Lucas Black as James, is wooden at best and self-conscious at worst.  The pacing is off and much is due to the ""reworking"" of the dialogue.  A successful two hour play and film was cut to a mere 88 minutes.  It would have been better to cut the whole idea of remaking this film.There was a clever and very well-acted remake back in the 70's with Melissa Gilbert from ""Little House on the Prairie"" as Helen and Patty Duke as Annie Sullivan.  That was truely inspired casting especially as Melissa was a well-established and respected child actress and Patty Duke was the original Helen in the 1962 award-winning classic.

569897,A2PDVQRK9PSIPJ,B000056MOF,Tamarleigh Lippegrenfell,"[0, 0]","I was really enjoying this film and felt that they had done an excellent job of remaking a classic. Unfortunately, the ending ruined it for me. I admit that if I had never seen the other versions of this film, I wouldn't have had a problem with the ending. Nonetheless, the scene where Helen figures out that W-A-T-E-R spells 'water' is lacking in clarity and power when compared to the other versions. Patty Duke absolutely rocked that scene when she played Helen; Melissa Gilbert did a creditable job as well. In this Disney remake, the scene is not as good--and I don't fault the child actor for this; I think it is an issue of directing and editing.The problem is, that scene is the heart of the movie. That scene depicts the crucial moment that set Helen on the path that led to such achievement and renown. That moment is, ultimately, the reason the film exists. So although I could look back on this Disney version and think, &#34;Well, it was mostly pretty great--it was just the one scene that wasn't so good,&#34; and give it three stars, I cannot help but to think of this in the wider context of the importance of that scene. That being the case, I can only really give this movie two stars. The acting was excellent, as were so many other aspects of the film, but it missed the mark in the end.In Moneyball, Brad Pitt's character says, about baseball, that nobody cares about how good a season your team has unless you win the last game of the season. I feel that applies to movies. In baseball, the last game is the most important game not because it's last per se, but because by being last, it determines which team wins the season. The W-A-T-E-R scene is the most important scene in the movie and also happens to be the climactic finish (as is frequently the case with stories and films). The &#34;Disney 2000 Miracle Worker&#34; team had a great season, but it lost the championship game, and the disappointment in the end will remain the most memorable part of the experience for me.
