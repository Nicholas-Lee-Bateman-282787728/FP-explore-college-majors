1320866,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00347AIRG,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","While I cannot recall viewing this 1980 made-for-television film during its initial airing on CBS (in the middle of the actors' strike, no less), I saw it quite frequently during its frequent rebroadcasts on A&E; in 1989 and 1990.Based on Brooke Hayward's 1977 memoir about her troubled show business family, and produced by her brother, Bill(who, in a tragic coda to this story, took his own life in 2008), the film serves as a cautionary tale about emotional excess, and trying too hard to attain some unattainable Gatsbyesque  ideal of the perfect life.The late Jason Robards, the late Lee Remick , and the late Deborah Raffin(who dyed her blonde hair brown for the part, giving further prominence to this model's fabulous cheekbones) portray  film and play producer Leland Hayward, his third wife, actress Margaret Sullavan and their eldest daughter, Brooke, who later became an actress/ model. The two other Hayward children are the fair and ethereal Bridget, affectionately known as ""Brie"", later the namesake of actress Bridget Fonda( played by a wispy, fragile, and fairy-like Dianne Hull), and Bill(Hart Bochner).The film begins with Brooke en route to  perform in a play titled, ""Marching Song"" in New York on New Year's Day, 1960, but taking time to call her mother and British-born stepfather, Kenneth Wagg(Richard Johnson) in time to learn that her mother has just passed.The play in which Brooke was to appear is cancelled by order of her father. In the coming days, Brooke, not yet 23, and a divorced mother of two, must deal with a lugubrious family reunion during which the style-conscious Leland Hayward criticizes his son, not yet 19 and newly arrived from  a stint at Menninger's clinic and a subsequent incarceration for auto theft made when he was trying to escape the clinic, for not having a dark suit to wear for the occasion. Fragile Bridget, who has taken leave of Austen Riggs to attend her mother's funeral is greeted by an older sister who is happy to see her, but resigned and philosophical about their mother's death, stating it was her right to end it if she chose. Brooke vehemently disagrees. The siblings also reminisce about which of them had the better relationship with their mother.Soon we flash back to an earlier time when 6-year-old Brooke(Lindsay Brooke King) is with her mother in her dressing room as Maggie is prepping to go onstage. She reassures her daughter that she is play-acting when she tells the man who will appear onstage with her she loves him, and that she loves Brooke's father.We delve further into this world of ""beauty, grace, and joy"", but also see the cracks in the faade.Bridget(Kimberly Knox) and Brooke, who share a room, are spanked for  disrupting a party their parents are giving by repeatedly singing ""Mouse, Mouse, Come Out of Your Hole"" so loudly from their beds that the guests can hear them, which breaks Leland's heart  to the point where he promises Brooke he would never spank her again, and we later see his wistful side when her discusses his childhood abandonment by his mother with a slightly older Brooke( Melora Hardin); one may be startled by  young Bridget's use of the word, ""damn"", and we see Margaret's discomfort with her own fame when she reprimands a persistent autograph seeker who compliments her on her performance in ""The Mortal Storm"" (a great film, incidentally), but disrupts an outing with her children, including little Bill (Matt McGowan). Her children watch her break her own rule against uncivil behavior and then express regret for doing so.The family play up to the ultimate Hollywood fantasy in the scenes where the three well-dressed and well scrubbed children hide among the shrubs giggling as their  parents, dressed for an evening out, waltz on their front lawn in view of passing tour busses as Leland queries, ""Shall we brighten a few lives?"". Soon a limo arrives to whisk the couple away for the evening as the three children follow them to the edge of the driveway holding hands. Tourists  get off the bus to take pictures at the entrance gate . A lady(Evelyn Bell) asks the nattily dressed trio, ""Are you Margaret Sullavan's children?"" to which the response is, ""No. We belong to Humphrey Bogart!""We enjoy flashback sequences of  plane rides given by Leland, whose first wife taught him how to fly( Hayward also co-founded Southwest Airlines), and we frequently hear  discussions about their neighbors, the offscreen Fondas( Henry Fonda having been Maggie's first husband)with whom they are on excellent terms, but with whom the Hayward children frequently compare themselves.When the Fondas move to Connecticut, the Haywards soon follow suit. Maggie wanted her children to grow up around natural things, and their home in Connecticut  is a farm on which the children reluctantly witness a chicken being killed for dinner at Maggie's insistence.Their last summer of innocence finds Maggie leaving her family to do a play overseas for several months while a reluctant Leland, who booked the play for her, has to manage his career and the children on his own. His old abandonment issues take hold, and upon Maggie's return, the general tone of the household changes and the children learn of their parents' impending separation, the reason being Leland's affair with  once Nancy ""Slim"" Keith( Linda Gray), who will become his fourth wife. We see Brooke's devastation as she confronts both parents separately about this turn of events. The three children snuggle in bed together, trying to console themselves in the face of an uncertain future.But soon Maggie and her children dine with Kenneth Wagg as the children hear their mother's amusingly vengeful thoughts towards their father. Scenes of the three joyously throwing rice at the new Mr. and Mrs. Wagg contrast sharply  with Kenneth's sober reading of Maggie's will to her now-grown children a decade later.An emotional tug-of-war between the children's affections begins between Maggie and Leland. Maggie tries to raise them conservatively, but Leland gives them lavish gifts when they visit him in California. There is a moment when the fragile teenaged Bridget  reflects on Brooke's similarities to their mother, and feels insecure. But her  stepmother tries to boost her confidence, telling the strikingly pretty girl that  she will be ""the swan of all time"" when she grows into herself.Another flashback sequence finds the preteen sisters  looking through their mother's clothes and memorabilia and stunned to learn about her previous marriage to director William Wyler. Brooke wants to learn more, but her sister doesn't.The 50s find Brooke beginning her career, and Maggie's relationship with her younger children becoming acrimonious. Bridget blossoms during time at school in Switzerland, but at home resents what she felt was her mother's hypocracy in expressing resentment towards a houseguest( in real life, gossip columnist Hedda Hopper), but then goes out of her way to pander to her at a luncheon. Maggie's constant emotional blackmail, ""I suppose you should go live with your father"", ultimately drives her two younger children to do exactly that. The scene of her reaction to Bill's departure is devastatingly pathetic.Maggie later struggles in her career, partially to the dismay of a television program director played by Christopher Guest, and as her downward spiral continues, she precedes Bridget in spending time at Austen Riggs .Presumably many of their emotional issues would have been dealt with differently in modern times.Upon her sudden demise from an overdose of pills, a figure representing Leland's fifth wife, Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward(Harriman), later the U.S. Ambassador to France,collects Brooke to take her to her father's apartment. Within 10 months, she repeats the same errand upon the death of 21- year-old Bridget via the same method as her mother. In the intervening months between the two tragedies,Bridget confides to her older sister that she is epileptic after Brooke finds her sister disheveled in her apartment, which she thoroughly trashed during a seizure. Ever vigilant about her privacy, Bridget refuses to have a roommate to watch over her, and in the meantime begins an apprenticeship  at the Williamston Playhouse and a romance with one of its directors(Dennis Holahan), making her tragic end all the more incomprehensible, although in the book, it is mentioned that Bridget may have been having a seizure at the time of her death.After her funeral, Brooke speaks with Bridget's sweetheart about her troubled history, and her tells her she can either live or die after all she has endured.Subsequent years find  Brooke having another failed marriage(to the off-screen Dennis Hopper), and Bill working as a producer (""Easy Rider"" starring his childhood friend, Peter Fonda is mentioned). During Leland's final illness he rates the Old Hollywood actresses he knew intimately for the amusement of his children. When he asks for Bridget, the two reassure him she's on her way rather than remind him that she has been dead for over ten years.In response to Leland's question about a moment in her life she would like to relive, Brook mentions one day, a decade after her parents' divorce when Leland visited Maggie at her home in Connecticut, and as she watched them from a distance, she could see that they still loved each other.As we view Brooke's ponderous solo treks along a beach, in contrast to those made hand-in-hand by the once happy, intact family she knew, one is left with a feeling of sadness  about this family's carelessness with the best of their many resources--each other.While this female counterpart to ""The Great Gatsby's"" Nick Carroway feels she can only move forward, one is somehow reminded of ""The Great Gatsby's"" final lines: ""So we beat on, boats against the current bourne back ceaselessly into the past.""",5,The Beautiful and the Damned,1379635200,"09 20,
