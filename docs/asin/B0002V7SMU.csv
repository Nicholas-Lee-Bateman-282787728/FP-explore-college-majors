He observes country folk, adults and children, and is initially pretty numb to it all. Over time he seems to soften and cannot bring himself to commit suicide. He observes some of the simplest animalistic and human instincts. Taking a couple of chances to experience a bit more before he ends his life shows him how his actions may have affected others. Be warned, there is some sexual footage in this film that is not for the squeemish!",4,bleak but full of life and introspection,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,606,"['movie', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'very', 'raw', 'very', 'artistic.A', 'weary', 'man', 'love', 'art', 'city', 'country', 'seeking', 'serenity', 'then', 'end', 'life', 'country', 'folk', 'adults', 'children', 'initially', 'pretty', 'numb', 'time', 'soften', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'commit', 'suicide', 'simplest', 'animalistic', 'human', 'instincts', 'Taking', 'couple', 'chances', 'experience', 'bit', 'more', 'life', 'how', 'actions', 'may', 'have', 'affected', 'others', 'Be', 'warned', 'sexual', 'footage', 'film', 'not', 'squeemish']",N/A

845838,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B0002V7SMU,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[8, 11]","I should like this film, but I don't.  It has a lot of qualities I admire in films.  Long takes, ambiguity, excellent, widescreen photography, yet, I can't help but think that the director read a book on ""how to make an art film"", which listed the above techniques, and then made this film (and threw in 2 horses screwing and a man making love to an 80 year old woman).  I found this almost a hodgepodge of art house cliches.  This film doesn't seemed to have evolved organically or naturally, like the films it emulates (like the work of Tarkovsky, which this film has been compared to).  It feels like a carbon copy of an art film.  Like I had said in a previous review of Bruno Dumont's 29 Palms and Gus Van Sant's Gerry, there seems to be a lot of posers out today making ""slow, ambiguous"" films in an attempt to be arty.  They try to emulate the masters (like Tarr, Tarkovsky, and Jodorowsky), but they miss the point.  Art is a mysterious process, coming out when you least expect it.  There's no formula.  I think it says more about our culture when a filmmaker makes a film like this with all the ""art film"" elements there, there's a tendency to rush out and automatically declare it a masterpiece.  This is misguided and foolish thinking.  A work of art must connect on a much deeper level.  Just because it resembles a work of art doesn't make it one.  This film is not completely worthless, as there is some good camerawork and the setting is beautiful, but I found the whole exercise superficial and shallow.",2,"A failed attempt at an ""art"" film...",1222992000,"10 3, 2008",2008,1520,"['should', 'like', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'lot', 'qualities', 'admire', 'films', 'Long', 'ambiguity', 'excellent', 'widescreen', 'photography', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'director', 'read', 'book', 'how', 'make', 'art', 'film', 'listed', 'above', 'techniques', 'then', 'made', 'film', 'threw', '2', 'horses', 'screwing', 'man', 'making', 'love', '80', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'found', 'almost', 'hodgepodge', 'art', 'house', 'cliches', 'film', ""n't"", 'seemed', 'have', 'evolved', 'organically', 'naturally', 'films', 'work', 'Tarkovsky', 'film', 'been', 'compared', 'carbon', 'copy', 'art', 'film', 'had', 'said', 'previous', 'review', 'Bruno', 'Dumont', '29', 'Palms', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Gerry', 'be', 'lot', 'posers', 'out', 'today', 'making', 'slow', 'ambiguous', 'films', 'attempt', 'be', 'arty', 'try', 'emulate', 'masters', 'Tarr', 'Tarkovsky', 'Jodorowsky', 'miss', 'point', 'Art', 'mysterious', 'process', 'coming', 'out', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'formula', 'think', 'more', 'culture', 'when', 'filmmaker', 'film', 'art', 'film', 'elements', 'there', 'tendency', 'rush', 'out', 'automatically', 'declare', 'masterpiece', 'misguided', 'foolish', 'thinking', 'work', 'art', 'must', 'connect', 'much', 'deeper', 'level', 'Just', 'work', 'art', ""n't"", 'make', 'one', 'film', 'not', 'completely', 'worthless', 'good', 'camerawork', 'setting', 'beautiful', 'found', 'whole', 'exercise', 'superficial', 'shallow']",N/A

I know these people live simply, and do not have a grocery store to go get meat, eggs, etc., but I could not stand the animal killings: the bird and the screaming of the pig (horrible!).  A man also seemed to be cutting off the airway of a puppy, just to make him make noise (to sound like singing), which I was sickened by.  Live way out in the country, not much to do, I guess.I understand what the movie was trying to say, but I just did not like it very much.  At times, it dragged on...camera panning for 5 minutes or more.  I just did not find it that interesting.  I was bored a lot of the time, and some things did not seem to have much of a point.  The sex scene was strange, more like an instruction with him as the instructor, saying, ""do this, no, not like that, move here, further over, now turn, now face this way, face down, face up (and all this time, nothing is happening)!  The way he approaches her too is just, ""O.K., I would like to have sex with you"".  She says, ""you mean, you want to fornicate?"".  He says ""yes"", she says, ""alright, but I would rather do it tomorrow"", and he says""that's fine"".  What is that?  They also never tell you anything about the man's background, and why he is so disillusioned with his life, why he wants to kill himself, etc.  I did not really care that much if he did or not, because I did not feel like I really knew him, or sympathized with him or anything.I like artistic movies just as much as the next (artist) person, but I would like them to be interesting and to have a little more of a point to them; maybe a little more depth of character.

845840,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B0002V7SMU,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[7, 11]","Another great Tartan Video release with a terrific in-depth interview with the film's director, Japon (Spanish for ""Japan"") is a resonant film whose title, says director Carlos Reygadas, is meant to symbolize the rising sun--i.e., the renewal of life.Most of the characters in the film are non-professional actors and this is certainly true of the two leads, a late 50s-year old artist who says he wants to commit suicide, and the 80s woman he eventually stays with, in a completely isolated mountain village in Mexico.As is true for the best Westerns, the land is a major character here and Reygadas manages, with his keen and skillful eye, to fuse the broad vista of what could be called a ""soft"" mountainous terrain with a growing sense of innocence on the part of the painter who, coming from a city (likely Mexico City), begins to feel the effects of a rural life in how he sees things, thinks about things, understand things.The culminating scene of a sexual encounter is a powerful one--startling, completely unexpected, and all the more emphatic of the film's theme, as stated by the director, on the basis of that very intensity.Sometimes what you think you want is not what you actually do--because it is not what you really want. Sometimes you discover that what you thought you wanted was less than what life means to you. And so you then do what life really means you to do--your life. It's your choice.Japon succeeds brilliantly because its simplicity--which is no doubt what the director was striving for--penetrates our thinking hearts, our feeling minds.
