803689,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0001FVDQ4,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","What makes Firestarter such a treat to watch is that the concept itself is extremely appealing so I was totally prepared for an awesome movie (which it is).  It's about Drew Barrymore's character being able to start fires when becoming angry enough, and her father with the ability to alter things occur with his mind.  The two of them being together creates really frightening and dangerous results.The first half is about Drew and her father running away from the government and trying to hide as much as possible while keeping a low profile, and the second half is when the government eventually captures them and they try to find ways to escape when it's realized the people they're dealing with have bad intentions in store for them.  A really surprising ending- at least, I didn't see it coming.  The final 10 minutes are AWESOME to watch.Perhaps I could complain that once the two are caught, there's a fair bit of uneventfulness between Drew and the ""cleaning guy"" (you'll see what I mean) though for storyline reasons, these segments are pretty much mandatory.  Also the father's special abilities don't occur as often as Drew's so the father feels slightly underutilized.  Another small complaint.Considering the year is 1984, I'm not really a fan of early 80's films.  However knowing Stephen King is the one responsible for such a terrific concept and storyline, I have no problem watching one of his films *regardless* the year it was released.I love how the father continues to stress to Drew Barrymore the importance of not getting angry so she doesn't accidentally create any regrettable mistakes that could harm her and/or her father.  This is an emotional piece of writing here.  Also, wow, Drew was a really adorable and smart kid wasn't she?  Being so innocent with such a deadly fire-starting ability makes the movie even more exciting.Overall, Stephen King is the master of horrror and weirdness for a reason- a movie like Firestarter is just superb.

She's afflicted with pyrokenesis (starting fires w/ her mind) handed down to her by her mum Vicky (Heather Lockleer) and dad Andy (David Keith), who were both injected with an experimental serum by a secret government organization called ""The Shop"". Now Charlie is on the run with dad, trying to escape the clutches of the nefarious shop operatives who've already killed mum! Unfortunately, an assassin named Rainbird (George C. Scott) wants Charlie for his own demented reasons. Along with Capt. Hollister (Martin Sheen), Rainbird plans on exploiting Charlie's powers, then killing her with a quick blow to the head! He's a sick one! As much as I like Drew Barrymore in this, FIRESTARTER has it's lame moments of pure cheese, like when Mum's oven mits burst into flames, whatta riot! Or when flaming mannequins (shop agents) fly through trees at Charlie's instigation during the blazing climax! Still, it's not a terrible movie, just not a classic. Then, there's FIRESTARTER 2: REKINDLED, a nearly 3 hour sequel that suffers from a bloated storyline that could have easily been squeezed into an hour! Charlie's all grown up now, and suffering from nightmares from her past, as well as that pesky burning thing. She is unaware that Rainbird (Now played by Malcolm McDowell) is alive (?!) and still infatuated with her. He's also raised up a small army of kids with various psychic abilities (sort of a bratty version of Village Of The Damned). These kids are being trained as weapons of course, and will ultimately face Charlie in an all-too-whimpy showdown. Dennis Hopper (Night Tide, Blue Velvet) is also in this as Richardson, a clairvoyant with the personality of day-old oatmeal. REKINDLED has far more smoke than fire, and seems almost endless to sit through! It's more or less a freebie tacked on to the infinitely superior original. So, grab some marshmallows and roast 'em by the TV screen!

It is the story of a man who, along with his future wife, undergo an experiment with Lot-6 (supposedly a hallucinogen) supported secretly by a government branch called The Shop.  The experiment leaves the couple with some psychic abilities and their offspring, Charlie, more-so.  Charlie has the ability to cause fires using only the power of her mind.  Father and daughter must race to expose the plot before The Shop can secret them away somewhere or worse.  This is a decent book to film movie but I think it could have been done more true to the book as fans would have preferred.  The sequel, if it can be called that, is SO bad, so very bad.  It ignores the original story for the most part and builds on it any olde way they wanted to.  Rainbird is amazingly back from the dead and apparently no ones flunky or gun for hire anymore.  Charlie is all grown up and miserable.  To top it off, once more she is in over hear head in a plot with Rainbird.  Malcolm McDowell, though I love him, simply cannot recapture George C. Scotts performance in the first as Rainbird.  NO COMPARISON.  What became of Charlie when she went to the New York Times is beyond this story let alone what happened to Art Carney and Louise Fletcher's characters?

There were so many King movies being made at the time that this one's weaknesses became even more apparent.

From this genetic background she has developed the mysterious ability to set anything on fire at will, especially when she's angry. That makes her very interesting to government officials seeking to exploit her skill as a secret weapon. Her father seeks to protect her by using his powers of mind-control, and George C. Scott plays an Indian who believes the girl must be destroyed. There's a routine climax involving a lot of impressive pyrotechnics, but none of this is grounded in a dramatically solid foundation, and none of the characters are developed enough for us to care about them.

If you are a real Stephen King fan, you might not like either version of Firestarter as neither version is like the book, but I've read the book which is quite long and if everything that was in the book was put into a movie, that movie would be about six hours long. However the original 1984 version of Firestarter comes close to the book in many ways, but its problem is that the movie could have been just a little longer and filled in a bit more of the background.The new movie does that, but it's a form of revisionist history. Things happen in the 2nd movie differently from the original movie, and from the book as well. For the purist, this is not quite a good thing. I sat through the movie saying ""now that didn't happen like that,"" that didn't happen that way,"" and so on, comparing the differences and not quite enjoying the film. The problem is, the second film is not all that enjoyable as the star of this film is no longer the cute Drew Barrymore nor are the other actors up to the quality and caliber of the ones in the first movie.Somebody who has never read the book (which is one of King's better books) or seen the first movie, might enjoy Firestarter 2, which is more a strange combination of the Scanners and X-Men movies than a Stephen King piece. As science fiction stories go, it's okay; and despite what the DVD cover says, this is a science fiction story and not anything supernatural. It's not bad, but it could have been so much better.

803718,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0001FVDQ4,Robert Badgley,"[2, 2]","This two-film pack of Firestarter(released May 11/84)and Firestarter 2-Rekindled(released Mar/04),seems,at first glance,to be a made-in-heaven pairing...if only that was the case.The best of the two remains Firestarter.The second was a made for TV miniseries produced in 2002,which I did not know of at all,but soon found out after getting fadeout after fadeout,as if going to commercials.The 2nd film is a ponderous thing to watch all at once,coming in as it does at over 160 minutes.It touches base with its' filmic roots from the first one but re-writes it into its own image to create an entirely different set of circumstances upon which to build its plot.Firestarter stars a young Drew Barrymore as the sibling of two parents who underwent terrible experiences after having participated in drug experiments on campus.Code named Lot#6,it was a government run project(The Shop) whose dire consequences for its participants left some dead,but others with enhanced abilities such as mind reading,psycho-kinesis,etc.Drew's father played by David Keith has been on the run from the authorities from day one,who are after not only him but Drew,who has the power to produce and control fire from within.The project head is Martin Sheen and he dispatches George C Scott to bring the pair in,which he eventually does.The Shop puts both in separate cells and Scott acts as a friendly janitor to befriend frightened Drew.It works to a point,but when Drew is reunited with her father in a barn,Scott is up on the second floor and shoots her father.As he dies he tells her to destroy the complex and get away.This she does,also making sure Scott becomes the first wiener in the fiery roast.Coming in at around 115 minutes,the film was on the long side in the 80s(I recall very well its debut)and it is still on the long side today.I am not advocating cutting it down,as the film is what it is and must stand that way,but I can not give it any more points today than I did then.It was a well acted picture but one that seemed to take a circuitous route to finally get to the point;which I still see in viewing it today.3 to maybe 3 1/2 stars...at best.Firestarter 2-Rekindled has a totally new and different cast than the original and they re-write it to form their own plot,extending it far beyond the originals confines into totally new territory.This one repeats the originals fleeing of a young girl and her father from the authorities,played originally by Barrymore and Keith but now played by Skye Bartusiak and Aaron Radl.We go through much the same plot line as the original except that the girls father is now kept alive at a facility with a much different name than the Shop and it is run this time around by Scott's character,played here by Malcolm McDowell.McDowell is now alive and disfigured,having been burned by the girl on his left side,not killed as in the original,after his deception was revealed during her original escape.Fast forward and McDowell has gone beyond the original Lot#6, to Lot#23 and there are now about 5 boys under his direct tutelage and influence.McDowell has been looking for the young girl for many,many years and he joins with a private concern to have its employees track down not only her but the rest of the survivors from Lot#6.The original film has Barrymore and Keith as pretty much the only two left out of that program;go figure.The company has one of its young men track down and finally successfully locate the girl now grown up.Along the way they also have tracked down the others and killed them as they find them.The young man and the girl fall for each other(of course)and as circumstances would have it another of the Lot#6 survivors befriends the girl,then turns her and her boyfriend in.Not only do we we find out McDowell's obsession with the girl is a deviant and sexual one(of all the places this plot had to go!),but he has set up a town to be the brunt of his experiment,with her as the centrepiece.His young boys,all with special powers,are also all in on this experiment and once the shoe drops she is finally able to convince them that this destruction is totally unnecessary and counter productive to who they are.McDowell finally gets his comeuppance,her boyfriend is killed, and she leaves for Canada.This film does have some impressive actors like McDowell and Dennis Hopper,as one of the last surviving Lot#6-ers.But even they cannot keep this juggernaut of an overly long,long film from sinking under its own ponderous weight.As I said the writers have changed this script to suit their own needs and it goes way beyond Stephen Kings own book.All in all it's a poorly done ""experiment"" and it should have been burned along with everything else.2 stars.Technically speaking both films are in their original w/s a/r`s-Firestarter 2:35:1,and Firestarter 2-1:78:1.Both are clear and crisp.Neither have any extras.The best thing about this set is the first Firestarter,which was never really that good a film to begin with,just fair to middling at best.But the second film really sunk this story to an all time low with a terrible,some would call sequel,but I call a bad re-write.If the story tweaks your interest,then buy the first one on its own,but avoid the 2nd with a passion.",3,Is it worth buying the two-film set?,1345334400,"08 19,

David Keith and Heather Locklear are believable as her parents. Firestarter 2 was new to me. I didn't expect much but did find it entertaining with a twist ending.
