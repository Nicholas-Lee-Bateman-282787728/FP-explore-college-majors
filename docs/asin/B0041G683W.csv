And as you Les Mis fans know, that's very high praise.Jean Valjean: Alfie Boe has such a fantastic voice! It was different from all the other Valjeans. It was so pure, yet strong. He knocked Colm Wilkinson out of the water without this one.Javert: Norm Lewis was great. He had such a strong voice and served as the perfect antagonist to Valjean.Fantine: I personally think that Lea Salonga is a better Fantine. Her voice is absolutely gorgeous, but I think better suited for Fantine. She sounded amazing! I have never come across a Fantine I liked until now. Lea Salonga was just...wowCosette: Cosette, as a character, is as boring as watching paint dry. But Katie Hall is as good as Judy Kuhn, who was also very good.Marius: He honestly wasn't that bad. Yes, he was much weaker than the rest of the cast. However, he did show off a more immature side to Marius and brought a more youthful side to the role. While I don't really think he belonged in the 25 Anniversary Concert, he was good enough.Eponine: Samantha Barks is probably my favorite Eponine. Lea Salonga has a beautiful voice and was a fabulous Eponine. But I think Samantha Barks injects the emotion needed for Eponine. She has rougher voice (as opposed to Lea Salonga's pure, perfect voice), without sounding whiny and still sounding beautiful. Samantha was amazing during ""On My Own"" and ""A Little Fall of Rain.""It wasn't a perfect performance, but I still very much enjoyed it and would recommend it.",4,An amazing performance,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,1555,"['absolutely', 'amazing', 'have', 'say', 'up', '10th', 'anniversary', 'concert', 'Les', 'Mis', 'fans', 'know', 'very', 'high', 'praise.Jean', 'Valjean', 'Alfie', 'Boe', 'fantastic', 'voice', 'was', 'different', 'other', 'Valjeans', 'was', 'so', 'pure', 'yet', 'strong', 'knocked', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'water', 'one.Javert', 'Norm', 'Lewis', 'was', 'great', 'had', 'strong', 'voice', 'served', 'perfect', 'antagonist', 'Valjean.Fantine', 'personally', 'think', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'better', 'Fantine', 'voice', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'think', 'better', 'suited', 'Fantine', 'sounded', 'amazing', 'have', 'never', 'come', 'Fantine', 'liked', 'now', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'was', 'just', 'wowCosette', 'Cosette', 'character', 'as', 'boring', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'Katie', 'Hall', 'as', 'good', 'Judy', 'Kuhn', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good.Marius', 'honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Yes', 'was', 'much', 'weaker', 'rest', 'cast', 'However', 'did', 'show', 'off', 'more', 'immature', 'side', 'Marius', 'brought', 'more', 'youthful', 'side', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'belonged', '25', 'Anniversary', 'Concert', 'was', 'good', 'enough.Eponine', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'probably', 'favorite', 'Eponine', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'was', 'fabulous', 'Eponine', 'think', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'emotion', 'needed', 'Eponine', 'rougher', 'voice', 'opposed', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'pure', 'perfect', 'voice', 'sounding', 'whiny', 'still', 'sounding', 'beautiful', 'Samantha', 'was', 'amazing', 'My', 'Own', 'Little', 'Fall', 'Rain', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'performance', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'would', 'recommend']",N/A

Mind me, the music/orchestra espectacular, but the choosing of some of the main ""chracters"" wasn't the best. My scale from 1-10 is as follows: Valjean? 8, Cossette? 9, Javert? 10+, the children? 10, the Inkeepers? 8, the Monk? 8+, and Marius? 0. This one was the mistake of the whole production. Can'tbelieve Producers chose this weak/non expressive person to represent such a magnificet character.  What a waste! In conclusion; I have this DVD just to have the collection complete, otherwise I wouldn't even consider buying it.

1379962,AY4R8JIZO1LBH,B0041G683W,A music fan,"[1, 1]","Wow, hard to believe Les Mis is 25.  All in all, this was an event worthy of one of the most successful musicals of all time.  It's my absolute favorite musical.Okay, first let's start with the good stuff.  Some folks will disagree, but I thought Alfie Boe was actually a better Jean Valjean than Colm Wilkinson.  Even though Colm will always been identified with the role, I felt Bowe had a stronger voice, especially during the songs that really required it (Who am I, Bring Him Home).  Enjolras was an amazing improvement over Michael Maguire from the 10th anniversary cast. As much criticism that has been heaped on Nick Jonas for this concert (we'll get to that later), Maguire appeared to be the amateur back in 1995. But Ramin Karimloo was amazing here - strong, powerful voice and hit all the important notes. Once again Lea Salonga was fantastic, this time as Fantine. I enjoyed Norm Lewis' interpretation as Javert, but as others have said, that role will always belong to Philip Quast.Okay, Nick Jonas as Marius. Really?! Was Justin Bieber not available?  I know Nick is actually a Broadway veteran, but that was as a young child. He has a very soft, weak voice that became very obvious when compared to the other seasoned veterans on stage. He could not project his voice loudly enough when it really counted, and that really detracted from the show.  I understand why they could not cast Michael Ball this time around, since he's in his mid-50s, but surely there would have been someone, ANYONE, who could have done a better job. It's ""Les Miserables"" - you don't need a ""name"" to make it work.I just loved the encore when they brought out the original 1985 cast (led by the aforementioned Mr. Ball) and they sang ""One Day More"" together, along with the current Jean Valjeans in London (the great Simon Bowman!).  That was really wonderful. I did wonder where were Patti LuPone (Fantine) and David Burt (Enjolras)? It's too bad they weren't there.Overall this concert had a lot of good things that they improved upon from the 10th anniversary concert. But the 10th anniversary concert was great too. It's really hard to compare the two as I feel they each stand on their own merits.",4,Has it been 25 years?,1306972800,"06 2, 2011",2011,2195,"['Wow', 'hard', 'believe', 'Les', 'Mis', '25', 'was', 'event', 'worthy', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'musicals', 'time', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'musical.Okay', 'first', 'let', 'start', 'good', 'stuff', 'folks', 'will', 'disagree', 'thought', 'Alfie', 'Boe', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'Even', 'Colm', 'will', 'always', 'been', 'identified', 'role', 'felt', 'Bowe', 'had', 'stronger', 'voice', 'especially', 'songs', 'really', 'required', 'Who', 'am', 'Bring', 'Him', 'Home', 'Enjolras', 'was', 'amazing', 'improvement', 'Michael', 'Maguire', '10th', 'anniversary', 'cast', 'much', 'criticism', 'been', 'heaped', 'Nick', 'Jonas', 'concert', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later', 'Maguire', 'appeared', 'be', 'amateur', 'back', '1995', 'Ramin', 'Karimloo', 'was', 'amazing', 'here', 'strong', 'powerful', 'voice', 'hit', 'important', 'notes', 'Once', 'again', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'was', 'fantastic', 'time', 'Fantine', 'enjoyed', 'Norm', 'Lewis', 'interpretation', 'Javert', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'role', 'will', 'always', 'belong', 'Philip', 'Quast.Okay', 'Nick', 'Jonas', 'Marius', 'Really', 'Was', 'Justin', 'Bieber', 'not', 'available', 'know', 'Nick', 'actually', 'Broadway', 'veteran', 'was', 'young', 'child', 'very', 'soft', 'weak', 'voice', 'became', 'very', 'obvious', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'seasoned', 'veterans', 'stage', 'could', 'not', 'project', 'voice', 'loudly', 'enough', 'when', 'really', 'counted', 'really', 'detracted', 'show', 'understand', 'why', 'could', 'not', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Ball', 'time', 'around', 'mid-50s', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'ANYONE', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'name', 'make', 'work.I', 'just', 'loved', 'encore', 'when', 'brought', 'out', 'original', '1985', 'cast', 'led', 'aforementioned', 'Mr.', 'Ball', 'sang', 'One', 'Day', 'More', 'together', 'current', 'Jean', 'Valjeans', 'London', 'great', 'Simon', 'Bowman', 'was', 'really', 'wonderful', 'did', 'wonder', 'where', 'were', 'Patti', 'LuPone', 'Fantine', 'David', 'Burt', 'Enjolras', 'too', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'there.Overall', 'concert', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'things', 'improved', '10th', 'anniversary', 'concert', '10th', 'anniversary', 'concert', 'was', 'great', 'too', 'really', 'hard', 'compare', 'two', 'feel', 'stand', 'own', 'merits']",N/A

Eagerly I tuned in but in the end I was left highly disappointed. The cast of 1995's special truly was the ""dream"" cast and with reason. Colm Wilkinson is without a doubt the best ValJean in the show's history, his chemistry with Phillip Quast is unmatched. It was so great to see Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway back as ""the T's"" though. Many slammed their performance from 95 but I found it most enjoyable, providing the comic relief these characters are. Lea Salonga, what can I say? First off, I LOVE Lea, but to cast her as Fantine was a bad call. Lea is without a doubt most the most well known and the best Eponine and to take her away from that role, I just don't know. Ruthie Henshall is the best Fantine (sorry to the Patti LuPone fans). And now to Nick Jonas, were producers thinking this was the only way they could sell tickets? Yes he looks the part of Marius but he can't hold a candle to Michael Ball (""Empty Chairs"" is a prime example).

1379990,A1ILI7DZ4K26YQ,B0041G683W,Clarity,"[24, 26]","Having easily watched the 10th Anniversary DVD over a hundred times, I was very anxious to see the 25th Anniversary.  The first time I watched it, I was disappointed.  But after watching it again - and again - those disappointments all vanished.  There's a learning curve that we 10th-Anniversary idolizers have to go through.From the very beginning I had complaints: What are those big screens up there?  This isn't a football game!  It's disorienting!  Can't they tell a simple story without all this gimmickry?  And why are the overhead lights moving?  Who would want to sit under those big contraptions?  Some of the songs sounded different.  It seemed that they cut-out some material, making the story-line harder to follow.  But now all is forgiven.  I feel this 25th Anniversary production is wonderful.  Here are some random observations:The song ""One Day More"" is (in my opinion) the most wondrous song in all of musical theater history.  All the different characters come together at the end of the first act and in their own voices, singing their own songs, assert their reason for living.  I agree with another reviewer that this was not exactly pristine.  But with everybody expressing their own wills and singing their own words at the same time, it's SUPPOSED to be a bit cacophonous.  Even the 10th Anniversary had some messiness in it.I thought the 25th storyline was more clear in the scene with the bishop, because the silver candle-holders were actually handed to Valjean, however it was less clear in explaining how a runaway cart was lifted by Valjean and how another man was arrested as a Valjean look-alike.The 25th was special in showing Valjean tearing-up his yellow card and declaring that ""another story must begin"".  Then the stage went dark and the name ""Les Miserables"" displayed on the screen.  This suggested that the play was only now beginning - that everything before was just prologue, just exposition.  Wonderful touch!  (Disney is also good at movingly introducing the title after an extended prologue - especially with the movie Pocohontas.)Like another reviewer, I too jumped off the couch and ran up to the screen when I saw the old Valjean from the 10th Anniversary appear on stage.  When he later stepped forward, I thought he was going to thank the audience, but instead the soft sounds of ""Bring him home"" began in the orchestra and I was ecstatic.  It was also wonderful to see the 10th Marius, as ebullient and powerful as ever.  It was touching to see the 10th innkeeper, such an endearing-looking man.  I had trouble recognizing the others.  Was the 10th Inspector there under that beard?Speaking of the innkeeper, the 25th innkeeper was made to look evil whereas the 10th was made to just look seedy.  Both were great.  However I preferred the 10th ""Master of the House"" song because Valjean and the others could be seen sitting in the background laughing and clapping and singing along.  It was like an intermission.  I also thought the 10th ""One Day More"" was extra touching because Valjean and the Inspector were standing next to each other.The 25th Fantine was just magical. I could not look at her face during her solo after she got fired - her expressions were that powerful.  I was surprised at the difference in height between Fantine and her boss and wondered if he might be wearing 'elevator shoes'.The 25th little boy (Gavroche?) was very special.

Those performers were all top notch, and the execution near perfect for a live performance. That being said, the 25th Anniversary falls far short. Nick Jonas is an embarrassment as Marius. His voice is not that great and his acting worse, the same expression used for the entire performance, like he was experiencing gastric pain. He should stay away from the theater and stick to singing for 12 year-old girls who have no discriminating musical taste. ValJean and Javert were decent performers, but in my opinion neither possessed the powerful voice required for their roles. Bring Him Home was the best performed song, the higher pitch of the song seemed to be in singer's wheelhouse more so than the rest of his numbers. The girl who played Eponine appeared to have a strong sweet voice, but she spoke more than sang, clearly annunciating each word at the expense of her singing. Even Lea Salonga as Fantine was disappointing - she seems to have lost the canary-sweet voice that she had 10-15 years ago.I will say the video and audio quality were excellent (Blu-ray). The big chorus numbers such as At The End of The Day were also good. I am waiting for the day when the 10 year concert is remastered and released in 5.1 audio, however with the 25th just coming out now, I don't expect that to happen anytime soon (if ever).",2,Pales in comparison to 10 year anniversary cast,1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,1403,"['admit', 'unfair', 'hold', '10', 'year', 'Anniversary', 'Concert', 'standard', 'performers', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'execution', 'perfect', 'live', 'performance', 'being', 'said', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'falls', 'far', 'short', 'Nick', 'Jonas', 'embarrassment', 'Marius', 'voice', 'not', 'great', 'acting', 'worse', 'same', 'expression', 'used', 'entire', 'performance', 'was', 'experiencing', 'gastric', 'pain', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'theater', 'stick', 'singing', '12', 'year-old', 'girls', 'who', 'have', 'discriminating', 'musical', 'taste', 'ValJean', 'Javert', 'were', 'decent', 'performers', 'opinion', 'possessed', 'powerful', 'voice', 'required', 'roles', 'Bring', 'Him', 'Home', 'was', 'best', 'performed', 'song', 'higher', 'pitch', 'song', 'seemed', 'be', 'singer', 'wheelhouse', 'more', 'so', 'rest', 'numbers', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Eponine', 'appeared', 'have', 'strong', 'sweet', 'voice', 'spoke', 'more', 'sang', 'clearly', 'annunciating', 'word', 'expense', 'singing', 'Even', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'Fantine', 'was', 'disappointing', 'have', 'lost', 'canary-sweet', 'voice', 'had', '10-15', 'years', 'ago.I', 'will', 'say', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'were', 'excellent', 'Blu-ray', 'big', 'chorus', 'numbers', 'such', 'End', 'Day', 'were', 'also', 'good', 'am', 'waiting', 'day', 'when', '10', 'year', 'concert', 'remastered', 'released', '5.1', 'audio', 'however', '25th', 'just', 'coming', 'out', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'happen', 'anytime', 'soon', 'ever']",N/A

The power, beauty and drama of this work never fails to profoundly move me when I watch it and the melodies haunt me for days afterward.When I saw the 25th Anniversary Concert was available on Blu-ray I ordered it immediately; my first thought was how it would compare with the 10th Anniversary Concert that I had watched so many times on LaserDisc. I almost thought of myself as a judge who would sit in judgment and pronounce sentence.I wasn't very far at all into the performance before I lost that mindset; I was swept up by the beauty, power, and emotion of this performance. Yes it is different from the 10th Anniversary Concert but suddenly that was of absolutely no importance as I felt I was witnessing a glorious, emotional performance of fabulous music.To get the technical considerations out of the way; the video and audio are all you would expect from a contemporary Blu-ray recording. The picture is clear and crisp and the surround sound is a delight to the ears. The only real disappointment with this disc is the absence of any liner notes; no commentary, pictures, nothing. It doesn't really seem like too much to ask that something be added that gives information on the cast and performance.The performance itself left me feeling that I had received my money's worth and more; I noticed at the end of the disc, after the concert that people in the audience seemed to be milling about, not really ready to bring the evening to a close. I felt the same way as if a wonderful experience was over before I was really ready for it to end.The closing credits mentioned something I was unaware of, a movie version was in the works. Well hooray, finally a movie version of the entire musical! I had off and on been checking to see if a movie version with full staging and action was available but had always been disappointed to see that it had not.It appears that during an interview in Spain, last September, a journalist asked Cameron Mackintosh why a movie version of Les Miserable's had not been made. It is reported that he said a contract for a movie had been signed and he said in part,""We'll be working with a screenplay writer over the next few months and hopefully if all that comes together, we will find a great director and start."" That is really good news to those of us who have loved the concert versions.I'll not make an attempt at evaluating all of the individual performances but will say that Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean brings a truly memorable voice to the part. The other roles are handled with emotion, power, and conviction; I found I had tears rolling down my cheeks at several points during the performance. Two tidbits of casting trivia, Lea Salonga, who sings the role of Fantine in this production sang the role of Eponine in the 10th Anniversary Concert; Jenny Galloway performs as Mme Thenardier in both performances.If you enjoy great music, well performed, you really owe it to yourself to buy this disc; if you don't have Blu-ray then get the DVD, just don't fail yourself by not buying it!",5,"A Wonderful, Powerful Performance!!",1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,3319,"['love', 'music', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'performance', 'countless', 'others', 'too', 'have', 'been', 'enthusiastic', 'fan', 'great', 'work', 'have', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'stage', 'have', 'owned', 'LaserDisc', 'version', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Concert', 'many', 'years', 'power', 'beauty', 'drama', 'work', 'never', 'profoundly', 'move', 'when', 'watch', 'melodies', 'haunt', 'days', 'afterward.When', 'saw', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Concert', 'was', 'available', 'Blu-ray', 'ordered', 'immediately', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'how', 'would', 'compare', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Concert', 'had', 'watched', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'LaserDisc', 'almost', 'thought', 'judge', 'who', 'would', 'sit', 'judgment', 'pronounce', 'sentence.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'far', 'performance', 'lost', 'mindset', 'was', 'swept', 'up', 'beauty', 'power', 'emotion', 'performance', 'Yes', 'different', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Concert', 'suddenly', 'was', 'absolutely', 'importance', 'felt', 'was', 'witnessing', 'glorious', 'emotional', 'performance', 'fabulous', 'music.To', 'get', 'technical', 'considerations', 'way', 'video', 'audio', 'are', 'would', 'expect', 'contemporary', 'Blu-ray', 'recording', 'picture', 'clear', 'crisp', 'surround', 'sound', 'delight', 'ears', 'only', 'real', 'disappointment', 'disc', 'absence', 'liner', 'notes', 'commentary', 'pictures', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'something', 'be', 'added', 'information', 'cast', 'performance.The', 'performance', 'left', 'feeling', 'had', 'received', 'money', 'worth', 'more', 'noticed', 'end', 'disc', 'concert', 'people', 'audience', 'seemed', 'be', 'milling', 'about', 'not', 'really', 'ready', 'bring', 'evening', 'close', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'was', 'was', 'really', 'ready', 'end.The', 'closing', 'credits', 'mentioned', 'something', 'was', 'unaware', 'movie', 'version', 'was', 'works', 'Well', 'hooray', 'finally', 'movie', 'version', 'entire', 'musical', 'had', 'off', 'been', 'checking', 'see', 'movie', 'version', 'full', 'staging', 'action', 'was', 'available', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'disappointed', 'see', 'had', 'not.It', 'interview', 'Spain', 'last', 'September', 'journalist', 'asked', 'Cameron', 'Mackintosh', 'why', 'movie', 'version', 'Les', 'Miserable', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'made', 'reported', 'said', 'contract', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'signed', 'said', 'part', ""'ll"", 'be', 'working', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'next', 'few', 'months', 'hopefully', 'together', 'will', 'find', 'great', 'director', 'start', 'really', 'good', 'news', 'who', 'have', 'loved', 'concert', 'versions.I', ""'ll"", 'not', 'make', 'attempt', 'evaluating', 'individual', 'performances', 'will', 'say', 'Alfie', 'Boe', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'truly', 'memorable', 'voice', 'part', 'other', 'roles', 'are', 'handled', 'emotion', 'power', 'conviction', 'found', 'had', 'tears', 'rolling', 'down', 'cheeks', 'several', 'points', 'performance', 'Two', 'tidbits', 'casting', 'trivia', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'who', 'role', 'Fantine', 'production', 'sang', 'role', 'Eponine', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Concert', 'Jenny', 'Galloway', 'Mme', 'Thenardier', 'performances.If', 'enjoy', 'great', 'music', 'well', 'performed', 'really', 'owe', 'buy', 'disc', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Blu-ray', 'then', 'get', 'DVD', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'fail', 'not', 'buying']",N/A

1380002,A1ODC1A64EVC8J,B0041G683W,"Donald Ramsey ""Donald Ramsey""","[1, 2]","LES MISERABLES 25th Anniversay Concert is beautifully done and a lovely rendition of this musical adaptation of Victor Hugo's incomparable novel.  Though the staging of this new version has been revised from the 1995 concert version, and the cast is not as widely known, yet, (except for Lea Salonga, imho) as the stellar 1995 Concert Performance, this is still a magnificent and glorious performance, always deeply touching and heart-wrenching.  The singer/actors are superb: Alfie Boe, Lea Salonga, Jenny Galloway, Norm Lewis, Samantha Jane Barks, Ramin Karimloo, and a surprisingly sweet and warm performance as ""Marius"" by pop singer Nick Jonas.  LES MISERABLES is a stunning, extraordinary musical, my personal all time best-loved favorite, and that by far, since the 1980s. This 25th Anniversary production is, hands-down, far and away THE FINEST performance of Les Miserables that I have ever seen in my life, whether on stage or a concert version, and it is well-worth having in your DVD library and I might add, well-worth watching as often as you can.  The spirit always needs a re-ennobling from time to time, and this beautiful story always accomplishes that.LES MIS' is the most intense, yet tender, loving, merciful and, in the end, uplifting musical ever composed for the stage. A metaphor for the victory of God's Mercy over Justice (yet not in conflict with real justice, of the Redemption of sinners triumphing, instead of their destruction.  It is the story of a man who, by Divine Aid (grace) goes from being a vengeful and hate-filled man, to a living saint whose heart and mercy and kindness are as immense, as his humility is profound.  LES MIS' is every bit as monumental, as a theatre-piece, as is Victor Hugo's novel as a literary work.  It simply, far and away, has no equal in the musical theatre, and I believe that it never will.  LES MISERABLES is, truly, incomparable.  When the good souls from heaven (the Garden of the Lord) sing the saintly Valjean into the Kingdom at the end, the crusade that they are calling you and I to join is not one of politics, bombs, or armed revolts or Political Parties or ideologies, but rather one of reverence and of mercy, kindness, forgiveness, compassion and generosity for each other that has never been heard of, or equalled before, in this Life.

1380008,A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0,B0041G683W,Elisa 20,"[4, 5]","Like many others who've reviewed the 25th anniversary ""Les Mis"" here, I loved the 10th anniversary ""Dream Cast"" version and for me, many of the main characters remain definitive in that version, more so than this.That said, this is still very enjoyable, with only two drawbacks for me. The pluses? The production itself is superior to the 10th anniversary--the staging, the orchestra and sound, the use of projection screens, the vast audience that clearly knows and loves the material (but has the respect for performers to stop applauding in the encore so we can hear them sing).No one has ever been a better Valjean for me than Colm Wilkinson, but Alfie Boe was still excellent and his more ""operatic"" version was still moving. For me, Wilkinson is just such a superior actor and the passion and conviction that he gave Valjean (whether in desperation or in heroism) was so much more successful for me than Boe's interpretation. But...YMMV as both are indisputably so talented.Likewise, I felt this Javert did not have the ruthlessness, nor the intellectual and moral conflict that Phillip Quast did. Norm Lewis was very good, but Quast, for me, was superb and his singing captured the character perfectly. Did they cut Javert's songs? I'm not an expert on ""Les Mis"" so I'm not certain if this was a trick of memory due to the performance difference or a genuine difference. Either way, Lewis' delivery was not as memorable for me, including in his final scene.I enjoyed Lea Salonga as Fantine and Samantha Bark as Eponine was very powerful. Enjolras moved me more here than in the original--and he was the only one whose performance I actually felt was stronger than the ""Dream Cast"".So? The bad?  For me, there were two performers who didn't work for me at all. First, the much-commented on Nick Jonas. I had an open mind going in, as I was completely unfamiliar with his singing. But, he really does disappoint. Not that he doesn't have a pleasant voice--he does--and I imagine he has -some- vocal training. The problem is...it isn't nearly enough for this role. When Michael Ball comes out in the finale, it just painfully underscored how Jonas' weak voice and inability to project or hit the big notes really ruined Marius. (And, imo, he brought no romantic charisma to his duet with Cosette either--and lacked much emotion at the barrciades as well..If he wasn't ""Nick Jonas"" there's no way this man would have been cast in this part, imo. Very unfortunate (and hard to believe it was necessary). And, yes, I know he was Gavroche on Broadway, but that doesn't require the vocal strength of any of Marius' songs. Imo, he took the part from someone who would have been so much better (I'm sure there are many singers who would have been better).But, far worse, imo, was Matt Lucas whose acting, singing and general ""look"" ruined one of the biggest numbers, ""Master of the House"", for me (including post-Revolution), even bringing down Jenny Galloway, whose Mme. Thenardier had been so fantastic in the Dream Cast performance.But...all that aside, if you've never seen it before, this would be an overall very satisfying production of ""Les Mis"". And, if you're a big fan of the Dream Cast, you might agree with me that it's worth getting this for the encore alone--with Colm Wilkinson, Boe, and two current Valjeans singing together--then joined by others from this and the 10th anniversary cast, for a rousing ""One Day More"".  That was a GREAT finale and made the entire thing, flaws and all, well worth it for me.",4,"Not the 10th, but Still a Treat",1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,3521,"['many', 'others', 'who', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', '25th', 'anniversary', 'Les', 'Mis', 'here', 'loved', '10th', 'anniversary', 'Dream', 'Cast', 'version', 'many', 'main', 'characters', 'remain', 'definitive', 'version', 'more', 'so', 'this.That', 'said', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'only', 'two', 'drawbacks', 'pluses', 'production', 'superior', '10th', 'anniversary', 'staging', 'orchestra', 'sound', 'use', 'projection', 'screens', 'vast', 'audience', 'clearly', 'material', 'respect', 'performers', 'stop', 'applauding', 'encore', 'can', 'hear', 'sing', '.No', 'one', 'ever', 'been', 'better', 'Valjean', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'Alfie', 'Boe', 'was', 'still', 'excellent', 'more', 'operatic', 'version', 'was', 'still', 'moving', 'Wilkinson', 'just', 'such', 'superior', 'actor', 'passion', 'conviction', 'gave', 'Valjean', 'desperation', 'heroism', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'Boe', 'interpretation', 'YMMV', 'are', 'indisputably', 'so', 'talented.Likewise', 'felt', 'Javert', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'ruthlessness', 'intellectual', 'moral', 'conflict', 'Phillip', 'Quast', 'did', 'Norm', 'Lewis', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Quast', 'was', 'superb', 'singing', 'captured', 'character', 'perfectly', 'Did', 'cut', 'Javert', 'songs', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'Les', 'Mis', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'was', 'trick', 'memory', 'due', 'performance', 'difference', 'genuine', 'difference', 'way', 'Lewis', 'delivery', 'was', 'not', 'memorable', 'including', 'final', 'scene.I', 'enjoyed', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'Fantine', 'Samantha', 'Bark', 'Eponine', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'Enjolras', 'moved', 'more', 'here', 'original', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'performance', 'actually', 'felt', 'was', 'stronger', 'Dream', 'Cast', '.So', 'bad', 'were', 'two', 'performers', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'First', 'much-commented', 'Nick', 'Jonas', 'had', 'open', 'mind', 'going', 'was', 'completely', 'unfamiliar', 'singing', 'really', 'disappoint', 'Not', ""n't"", 'have', 'pleasant', 'voice', 'imagine', '-some-', 'vocal', 'training', 'problem', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'enough', 'role', 'When', 'Michael', 'Ball', 'out', 'finale', 'just', 'painfully', 'underscored', 'how', 'Jonas', 'weak', 'voice', 'inability', 'project', 'hit', 'big', 'notes', 'really', 'ruined', 'Marius', 'imo', 'brought', 'romantic', 'charisma', 'duet', 'Cosette', 'lacked', 'much', 'emotion', 'barrciades', 'well..If', 'was', ""n't"", 'Nick', 'Jonas', 'way', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'part', 'imo', 'Very', 'unfortunate', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'necessary', 'yes', 'know', 'was', 'Gavroche', 'Broadway', ""n't"", 'require', 'vocal', 'strength', 'Marius', 'songs', 'Imo', 'took', 'part', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'many', 'singers', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', '.But', 'far', 'worse', 'imo', 'was', 'Matt', 'Lucas', 'acting', 'singing', 'general', 'look', 'ruined', 'one', 'biggest', 'numbers', 'Master', 'House', 'including', 'post-Revolution', 'even', 'bringing', 'down', 'Jenny', 'Galloway', 'Mme', 'Thenardier', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'fantastic', 'Dream', 'Cast', 'performance.But', 'aside', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'would', 'be', 'overall', 'very', 'satisfying', 'production', 'Les', 'Mis', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'Dream', 'Cast', 'might', 'agree', 'worth', 'getting', 'encore', 'alone', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'Boe', 'two', 'current', 'Valjeans', 'singing', 'together', 'then', 'joined', 'others', '10th', 'anniversary', 'cast', 'rousing', 'One', 'Day', 'More', 'was', 'GREAT', 'finale', 'made', 'entire', 'thing', 'flaws', 'well']",N/A

That said, many of us who love the Dream Cast from the 10th Anniversary DVD have probably seen the same DVD countless times in the past 15 years.So this entirely new cast with their own interpretation will take getting used to. Many of them are good such as Norm Lewis as Javire, Samantha Barks as Eponine, they are 2 of the shining standouts from this cast. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean is good too but will take getting used to. Quite a different Jean Valjean than I'm used to.Everyone else is good or passable with 1 exception. Nick Jonas as Marius is TERRIBLE!!!  (Hence the 4 stars instead of 5 stars).  He is one of the better looking Marius' I've seen BUT he has only one expression throughout the entire show.  Be it sorrow of happiness or anger he has that one constipated look on his face.  His voice is very weak, this is very very obvious when you hear the other men at the barricades.  Also the trio melody of Marius, Eponine, Cosette again its painfully obvious that there is absolutely no strength behind his voice.  The solo ""Empty Chairs and Empty tables"" is usually very moving, but not when Nick Jonas sings it.Despite that singular casting mistake, this is still worth the buy especially if you love Les Miserables.  It shows you a slightly different interpretation of the songs/show which theater goers love.  Its worth the buy.  Also, judge for yourself if Nick really is as bad as I say.

Though this filming of the concert production of the musical as performed at London's O2 Arena in January 2010 is hailed as the 25th anniversary of the musical, it is too frequently forgotten that the show, based on the Victor Hugo novel,  was originally written by  Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg and Alain Boubil with  Jean-Marc Natel and produced in Paris, France in 1980 (it closed after 3 months).  This English Adaptation is by Trevor Nunn and John Caird (with additional material by James Fenton) was brought to England and the world through the efforts of Cameron MacKintosh in 1985.The concert version is performed with orchestra and chorus in the top of the platforms in O2 Arena and the characters in the musical are in costume standing before microphones at the edge of the performing structure. The light crew performs spectacular effects with the enormous facilities at this 23,000 seat arena. Some action is projected on screens above the performers (the lifting of the cart by Valjean, the barricade, etc) and at other times the screens offer the audience huge close-up view of the performers. It works well under the direction of Nick Morris. The celebration of the birthday of the show is accompanied by prolonged appearances by past members of casts of the show, a light show, and much confetti and self congratulation speeches.As for the production itself it is populate by a generally strong cast.  Alfie Boe, a 37 year old British tenor who studied opera but now sings the big demanding musicals, is a very fine Jean Valjean. Norm Lewis, and American actor/baritone is one of the strongest Jauverts on record: he is a talent to watch. Lea Salonga brings years of experience to her interpretation of Fantine, Samantha Banks is a very strong Eponine, the Iranian-born Canadian musical theater singing actor Ramin Karimloo makes a striking impression in the role of Enjolras (he has been playing the role of Phantom in the 'Phantom of the Opera' in England for years), but the performance of Katie Hall as Cosette sounds strained, the Monsieur Th&eacute;nardier of Matt Lucas is completely unfocused (Jenny Galloway fares better as Madame Th&eacute;nardier), and it is obvious the producers elected to play to the young audience by miscasting pop star Nick Jonas as Marius: he tries very hard but is out of his league here.In all, this is an entertaining memento of a birthday celebration - heavy on audience screaming and special party effects - and rewards the creators of this lasting fine musical with due respect.

What an outstanding concert presentation of this opera-like musical adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel ""Les Miserables"", which has been a worldwide sensation for over 25 years. This 25th anniversary concert, taped on October 3, 2010 before a wildly enthusiastic audience of several thousand at the cavernous O2 Arena in London, was simply superb--the production values (state-of-the-art lighting, audio, and video), the fantastic talent assembled on the stage, including performers from several companies--all in costume--and a huge back-up chorus all contributed to an amazing performance.Notable among the cast were Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean, Lea Salonga as Fantine, Katie Hall as Cosette, and Norm Lewis as Javert. Much unfair criticism has been heaped upon pop singer Nick Jonas, who plays the part of Marius, the young student who falls in love with, and eventually marries, Cosette. While his voice is not operatic (while the other cast members have such voices), his voice is nonetheless fairly good and with his boyish good looks, he is very convincing as the young idealistic student who becomes the love interest of Cosette.The grand finale alone is the worth the price of the BD:  members of the original cast (and other previous and current cast members) sing duets and medleys, including four different Valjeans, all incredibly awesome. Their performance of ""Bring Him Home"" will bring tears to your eyes.The Blu-ray Disc's video and audio are both excellent--you will not be disappointed in the sharp, pristine video and the impressive, full audio.

This version does one better to that wish list and adds 1080P Blu-Ray HD.  So technically, this is the version to own if you have the hardware to display it.  In our case we have a projection system with a 92"" screen and sound to match.  I put it together myself and it cost less than most 55"" LCDs.  For this kind of program THAT becomes an event that's better than being there -- the popcorn is better (and cheaper) and our feet don't stick to the floor:)As to the performance, well, we love Colm Wilkinson in the first concert but we always wondered how the piece would be with a ""real"" tenor (ala Placido Domingo). Alfie Boe comes close to that ideal.  It's a whole different Val Jean.  Wonderful !!  Norm Lewis as Javert keeps up with the main protagonist with a more than menacing but nuanced performance.  Lea Salonga is a repeat from the previous cast, albeit, playing a different part.  She is so familiar with this work that she could probably sing ALL the parts if she had to.  She's always enthralling.  The rest of the cast fill their respective roles with distinction.  Marius doesn't bother me as much as he does some reviewers.So this Blu-Ray has it all.  It may be the single BEST Blu-Ray I have acquired because it is live HDTV rather than a Blu-Ray of a film.  Most films don't have the resolution of which Blu-Ray is capable.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed in all respects.  Initially the PBS airing here in the US was not as exciting as I had hoped.  Thinking the TV didn't do it justice, I purchased the DVD.  I was equally as disappointed.  As my title states, I think the performances , overall, lack the passion and depth of the tenth anniverary performances.  The more modern staging does NOT make up for the less than stellar performances of the cast.  Lea Solonga and the Thenendieres are the performances that bring back the emotions.  Samantha Banks as Eponine was beautiful in the role but I sure did not feel the ""undying"" passion of the character.  Nick Jonas is so lackluster in the very passionate role of Marius that I might understand the absence of passion from Eponine. The performance of ""EMPTY CHAIRS AT EMPTY TABLES"" lacks the suffering and angst that Michael Ball so passionately provides in every rendition.  Am I sorry I purchased this DVD? NO.

Well, I am a HUGE fan of this musical.  I have watched it twice live and love listening to it on CD.  I was ecstatic to catch the 25th anniversary on PBS (twice!).First the negatives (2 stars off):1. Nick Jonas - his voice is not terrible, really.  It just does not have the depth, and it may be a maturity level, but regardless he should not have been casted as Marius at this time.  Who knows, maybe in a decade his voice will mature?  Additionally, his one facial expression got annoying after the first song.  I really could not look at him anymore.2. The producers for casting Nick Jonas - I am actually more ticked off at the actual decision to cast him!  He is obviously not ready for this part, but it seemed like they wanted to use him as advertisement.  ""Les Miserables"" can stand on its own without any pop celebrity's help.Now, I do have to give a star back for Norm Lewis.  His voice is perfect for Javert!  I think he is the best Javert I have heard!Overall this concert was fantastic.  I am awfully biased toward John Owen-Jones, having seen him live, but Alfie Boe as Valjean is amazing!  His ""Bring Him Home"" and ""Finale"" had me crying just as hard.  I'm always happy to see Lea Salonga sing anything, and Ramin Karimloo as Enjoras- wow!

Yes, the acting was acceptable, but this is musical that is all about the music.  Yet they couldn't find a cast who can sing?  Really?

I was surprised to see how popular of a Musical this way, but more surprised when Nick Jonas, one of the Jonas Brothers, took part in this performance.These are the songs I like from this performance; Look Down (the prologue song), Castle on a Cloud, I Dreamed a Dream, Master of the House, and the Epilogue Version of Do You Hear The People Sing.

A few years later, I saw the Movie with my friend, Sheryll, and it was beautiful, especially with it's New Song which I will not describe the name of; don't want to cause any spoilers.25 Years, and still counting, it is now the year 2013, and I saw the Movie Musical Version, but that's another story. I should've learned about this Musical back when I was still young, but I guess it's never too late to do so. I checked out the 25th Anniversary of Phantom of the Opera after this, but again, that's another story.My vote of five stars for this marvelous performance. Bring THIS home.

Cavuoti,"[135, 143]","Having seen this show several times both in London and on tour in the US, it was a huge treat to be able to experience this 25th Anniversary Performance from the O2 Arena. I was fortunate enough to see it in  a US theatre the one night it played a few weeks after this was recorded. This show sold out the gigantic O2 so quickly they added a second show, which also sold out. It  was beamed live to theatres around the UK. And it just won ""Theatre Event of the Year"" in the Whatsonstage Theatregoers Choice Awards. I am delighted that they decided to make it available for Region 1. As wonderful as the 10th Anniversary show was, this is better in some ways. The lighting, the sets and projections, the lush orchestrations and the vast audience that just electrified the air add to the whole experience.This was an incredible group of performers that still gives me chills when I recall it. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean, is trained as as operatic tenor. He was spectacular in every way. He shows a very supple vocal range. He can hit & hold the high soft notes & belt out the big showstoppers with equal dexterity. I really do like Lea Solonga but felt she was just a little weak as Fantine. (She was killer as Eponine on the 10th.) Norm Lewis was a wonderfully wicked yet human Javert. His baritone strong & menacing & yet soft & soulful as he wrestles his conscience and loses. Katie Hall was a convincing as Cosette. Nick Jonas, in a bit of ""stunt casting"" that went badly awry, was Marius. It was glaringly apparent when matched with multi-award winning West End & Broadway veterans. Though he did get better. (This actually played two nights in the UK October 2-3. This is a compilation.) Canadian, Ramin Karimloo as Enjoras, the student leader, was impeccable. He has previously played this role & that of Marius. He's starred as the Phantom in London & is now playing the role in the sequel, Love Never Dies. (He has already twice been voted ""Best Actor in a Musical""  & is nominated for an Olivier this year for the same role.) Matt Lucas and Jenny Galloway obviously enjoyed their time as the Thernadiers, which made them great fun to watch. The encores must be mentioned again. They were incomparable to anything I've every seen.  If you love Les Mis, you will love this show. Don't try to compare it with the 10th. With its rich new orchestrations, new sets, some changes in the lyrics and slight yet clarifying changes in the show, it stands alone.",5,Awesome!,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,2457,"['Having', 'seen', 'show', 'several', 'times', 'London', 'tour', 'US', 'was', 'huge', 'treat', 'be', 'able', 'experience', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Performance', 'O2', 'Arena', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'US', 'one', 'night', 'played', 'few', 'weeks', 'was', 'recorded', 'show', 'sold', 'out', 'gigantic', 'O2', 'so', 'quickly', 'added', 'second', 'show', 'also', 'sold', 'out', 'was', 'beamed', 'live', 'theatres', 'UK', 'just', 'won', 'Theatre', 'Event', 'Year', 'Whatsonstage', 'Theatregoers', 'Choice', 'Awards', 'am', 'delighted', 'decided', 'make', 'available', 'Region', '1', 'As', 'wonderful', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'show', 'was', 'better', 'ways', 'lighting', 'sets', 'projections', 'lush', 'orchestrations', 'vast', 'audience', 'just', 'electrified', 'air', 'whole', 'experience.This', 'was', 'incredible', 'group', 'performers', 'still', 'when', 'recall', 'Alfie', 'Boe', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'trained', 'operatic', 'tenor', 'was', 'spectacular', 'way', 'very', 'supple', 'vocal', 'range', 'can', 'hit', 'hold', 'high', 'soft', 'notes', 'belt', 'big', 'showstoppers', 'equal', 'dexterity', 'really', 'do', 'Lea', 'Solonga', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'weak', 'Fantine', 'was', 'killer', 'Eponine', '10th', 'Norm', 'Lewis', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'wicked', 'yet', 'human', 'Javert', 'baritone', 'strong', 'menacing', 'yet', 'soft', 'soulful', 'conscience', 'Katie', 'Hall', 'was', 'convincing', 'Cosette', 'Nick', 'Jonas', 'bit', 'stunt', 'casting', 'went', 'badly', 'awry', 'was', 'Marius', 'was', 'glaringly', 'apparent', 'when', 'matched', 'multi-award', 'winning', 'West', 'End', 'Broadway', 'veterans', 'did', 'get', 'better', 'actually', 'played', 'two', 'nights', 'UK', 'October', '2-3', 'compilation', 'Canadian', 'Ramin', 'Karimloo', 'Enjoras', 'student', 'leader', 'was', 'impeccable', 'previously', 'played', 'role', 'Marius', 'starred', 'Phantom', 'London', 'now', 'playing', 'role', 'sequel', 'Love', 'Never', 'Dies', 'already', 'twice', 'been', 'voted', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Musical', 'nominated', 'Olivier', 'year', 'same', 'role', 'Matt', 'Lucas', 'Jenny', 'Galloway', 'obviously', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'Thernadiers', 'made', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'encores', 'must', 'be', 'mentioned', 'again', 'were', 'incomparable', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'love', 'Les', 'Mis', 'will', 'love', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'compare', '10th', 'rich', 'new', 'orchestrations', 'new', 'sets', 'changes', 'lyrics', 'slight', 'yet', 'clarifying', 'changes', 'show', 'alone']",N/A

Jean Valjean is a convict who has just been released after a nineteen-year prison sentence for stealing a loaf of bread.  He is given his ""yellow ticket of leave,"" which marks him as a criminal, and which he must present everywhere he goes.  After receiving unexpected kindness from a bishop he robs, Jean Valjean makes the decision to break his parole and start a new life.  However, his decision incurs relentless pursuit from the stern yet, ultimately, tormented Inspector Javert.  Jean Valjean will be forced on a journey in which he'll meet unforgettable characters and make momentous decisions that will effect many lives.This 25th anniversary concert is a true delight from start to finish.  I was particularly mesmerized by Alfie Boe, who brings a tenderness to the role of Jean Valjean.  Although Colm Wilkinson is truly delightful, it is nice to hear a different voice: one that fairly soars with beauty.  Norm Lewis, who portrays Inspector Javert, is truly stunning.  He brings anger, sadness and a steadfast determination to his role.  Javert is one of my favorite characters, and Mr. Lewis truly emphasizes the police inspector's conflicted emotions and unwillingness to submit to the grace that is offered him.  Eponine, my absolute favorite character of the show, is wonderfully portrayed by Samantha Barks.  Her tender voice throbs with pain for her unrequited love for Marius, and her sacrificial actions shine through.  Lea Salonga is perfect as Fantine, the mother who will resort to any means to save her child from cunning and ruthless caregivers.  The other cast members are equally wonderful.Regarding those who are giving Mr. Nick Jonas, (the pop star who portrays Marius), such a hard time: I honestly thought he did very well.  He is not trained in musical theater, yet his emotions are clear.  Jonas obviously tries very hard and loves the material.Please give this wonderful production a chance.

The 10th Anniversary is fantastic and the cast is infinitely better than 25th Anniversary cast! I've read other reviews about the quality of the 10th Anniversary DVD but the picture and sound are fine. I bought the 10th Anniversary about two months ago when I saw that the 25th anniversary concert had been released. I purchased the 10th Anniversary concert because I saw that Colm Wilkinson was Jean Valjean and I had seen him in the live musical in London in 1991 and he will forever be the definitive Jean Valjean to me. Also, the end of the performance on the 10th Anniversary edition which has many different actors who portrayed Jean Valjean in different countries around the world joining Colm Wilkinson on stage to sing ""Do you hear the people sing"" together with lines from all their native languages is stunningly beautiful and moving. The entire ensemble of actors really is a dream cast - it is just stand-out after stand-out perfomances.  Particularly spectacular performances are given by Phillip Quast as Javert and the absolute delight of Alun Armstrong as Thenardier - his rendition of ""Master of the House"" in the 10th Anniversary concert is a truly joyful experience that should not be missed by anyone who is a true fan of the musical - the entire stage of actors who are behind Alun as he sings that song are visibly delighted and enjoying his rendition of that song as much as the audience. Conversely, the 25th Anniversary edition concert is a true disappointment - the cast is just not as strong all the way across the board and even some of the stronger performances just do not compare to the renditions in the 10th Anniversary DVD. I am a person who LOVES the live musical - I've seen it twice in London and twice on Broadway and if you're like me and are just a true fan of the musical, the 10th Anniversary dream cast concert is a must - so I would really recommend that concert version over this 25th anniversary edition.

Unfortunately, I haven't seen it on Broadway, but one day I hope to.Onto this. I read the back of it before watching it and noticed that Nick Jonas was in it and at first I wasn't too pleased just because I do not like the Jonas Brothers. I thought: 'oh great, this will be ruined'. But my opinion and respect for Nick Jonas automatically changed when I saw him as Marius. He was an incredible Marius. He sang beautifully, and was well into character. Definitely not the Disney stereotype at all, which is what I expected.  My respect grew even more when I found out that he always wanted to play Marius. It was a decent performance.The cast and ensemble were incredible. Javert was amazing along with Jean Vajean (of course!). I was speechless at the end---this was beyond words the best thing I have ever seen.

Whitaker,"[6, 7]","I have been a fan of this wonderful musical since the day I first saw it at the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle; and have attended every performance that has performed in Seattle since that time (five or six performances? With tickets to see it this coming August when it returns).  To me, this musical is truly the greatest ever made!Inevitably, there will be comparisons between the original cast from the 10th Anniversary Concert and this one; that is to be expected (my review will be along those lines as I have watched the 10th and 25th anniversary performance back-to-back).  Trying to meet or exceed the performance of the original cast is almost an impossible task; however, most of the performers rose to the occasion and at least met the performance demands!There were a few parts where the performances seemed a little weak; I would like to know if this is the recording of the first performance or the second performance, I suspect that fatigue was wearing on a few of the performers toward the end.  Alfie Bow (Jean Valjean) and Norm Lewis (Javert)have to put a LOT of energy into their respective parts and I think it was showing toward the end of the show; but, for the encore they had to have found their second wind as they brought their vocal power to full strength!  I felt that the parts of Thenardier and his wife were a little on the weak side as well; nothing I can really put my finger on, but it did seem a little underwhelming.While I know little about the Jonas brothers, other than they are pop singers, I would have to say that casting Nick as Marius was a mistake.  While I'm sure that Nick may have a very good voice for pop singing, it is not of the caliber necessary for a stage musical; this became VERY evident when Michael Ball (the original Marius) came on stage for the encore and sang one of his parts.  Sorry Nick, you have the looks for the part but you need to concentrate on your voice to get it up to strength for the task of a stage musical.Saving the best for last, Lea Solonga as Fantine was marvelous!!  Lea played the part perfectly, though I do admit to some nostalgia in wanting to have seen her play Eponine one more time (as she did with the original cast).Overall, even with the few misses, this is a hit and I shall enjoy watching this many times over.

1380089,A1VRORLQZ02CBN,B0041G683W,My life is a movie,"[1, 1]","I don't feel it necessary to comment on this production as it has already been done so very eloquently (and not so) many times over already here.  Suffice to say I concur with the majority... a splendid production in every way!!! I'm so thankful I had the good fortune to catch it on the big screen and now own the blu-ray to view endlessly.I would like to just make one comment concerning the main source of irritation to many viewers, i.e. Nick Jonas.  I have to admit that I also strongly resented his appearance and vocalization initially, but after several viewings I have come to the conclusion that he is either not all that bad considering the role he is playing or that the otherwise strong cast makes his relative inferiority not so important after all.  It also helps that I shut Michael Ball out of my mind as I'm listening to him.  If I want to hear Michael Ball I have the 10th anniversary video.  And like one other reviewer said, there's no way Michael Ball could have been carried on or off the stage by Jean Valjean.  Nuff said about that.What I really want to say is, if you haven't read the book that this awesome musical is based on, please consider doing so.  Trust me, if you love the musical, you'll only increase your love and appreciation of it.  Boublil and Schonberg did an excellent job of transmitting the spirit of Victor Hugo's masterpiece considering their limitations (mainly that of time).  And for those who may never read the book, the fact that even this much of it is made known to the world is wonderful.  In fact I think Hugo himself would be pleased. And there are many who may not care to go any deeper, and that's fine.  But there is so much more contained in the book that you miss out on.  Not just in the story itself but even more importantly in the way Hugo tells the story. Admittedly, it is quite a tome, but even if you skip the detailed historical bits that go on and on for pages and pages (as I did my first reading... I am now on my third reading and taking the time to even read those) you will get a much fuller view of the characters and their interactions as well as their thought processes, and have your literary fancy tickled meanwhile.Anyway, I could go on and on but I realize this is not the place to review the book.  I just felt compelled to remind all you lovers of the musical out there that music, lights, action and all, it is only a semblance (albeit an excellent one) of it's source, Victor Hugo's ""Les Miserables"".

I was so excited when I saw this was coming on Blu Ray and I bought it without even watching any previews or reading any reviews of the actual London concert.Is it a good concert? Yes. The staging is impressive and the Blu Ray treatment gives you flawless video and audio quality. The performances are good but nothing like the stellar performances of the Dream Cast.There are a few notable exceptions, I will keep this disc and treasure it for Lea Salongas performance as Fantine. Her pristine voice and great acting ability knock her performances out of the park. A great treat to see her 15 years after the Dream Cast going from Eponine to Fantine . And speaking of the Eponine, Samantha Barks did an amazing job in that role. She was completely unknown to me before this and had huge shoes to fill in my mind and to my shock and immense pleasure she did just that. The last note in On My Own had me standing up and cheering. I won't say she is better than Lea Salonga in that role but she absolutely holds her own.Nick Jonas is a complete distraction in this show. His Marius has none of the depth that previous performers have given that role. His singing skills are not up to par with the material. Being fair though he did do a DECENT job on Empty Chairs at Empty Tables, but it no way has the impact that the song normally has on me. He brings down many of rousing anthems and really keeps them from reaching the soaring heights they normally would like. One Day More is the song most affected by his lackluster performance but Red and Black and Do You Hear The People Sing are equally watered down.There is a saving grace on this disc and that is the finale after the show ends. They bring back the original 1985 cast for One Day More and it had me leaping out of my seat. Also the original Valjean sing Bring Him Home with his contemporary was quite stirring. Having Michael Ball on the stage reprising his role as Marius reminded me how it should have been.There are some things on this disc that are magical and worth owning but as a whole it was flawed in my opinion.So the end result is this, I will be keeping the blu ray for Lea Salonga and Samantha Banks performances however I will also be ordering the 10th Anniversary DVD which has finally been re-released after being out of print for many years.My wish as I said in the title of this review is that the 10th Anniversary Concert got the blu ray treatment.",3,I wish they would put the 10th Anniversary Concert on Blu Ray,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,2556,"['So', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'have', 'multiple', 'recordings', 'years', 'loved', 'watching', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Dream', 'Cast', 'concert', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'coming', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'bought', 'even', 'watching', 'previews', 'reading', 'reviews', 'actual', 'London', 'concert.Is', 'good', 'concert', 'Yes', 'staging', 'impressive', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'treatment', 'flawless', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'nothing', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Dream', 'Cast.There', 'are', 'few', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'will', 'keep', 'disc', 'treasure', 'Lea', 'Salongas', 'performance', 'Fantine', 'pristine', 'voice', 'great', 'acting', 'ability', 'knock', 'performances', 'park', 'great', 'treat', 'see', '15', 'years', 'Dream', 'Cast', 'going', 'Eponine', 'Fantine', 'speaking', 'Eponine', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'role', 'was', 'completely', 'unknown', 'had', 'huge', 'shoes', 'fill', 'mind', 'shock', 'immense', 'pleasure', 'did', 'just', 'last', 'note', 'My', 'Own', 'had', 'standing', 'up', 'cheering', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'better', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'role', 'absolutely', 'own.Nick', 'Jonas', 'complete', 'distraction', 'show', 'Marius', 'none', 'depth', 'previous', 'performers', 'have', 'given', 'role', 'singing', 'skills', 'are', 'not', 'par', 'material', 'Being', 'fair', 'did', 'do', 'DECENT', 'job', 'Empty', 'Chairs', 'Empty', 'Tables', 'way', 'impact', 'song', 'normally', 'down', 'many', 'rousing', 'anthems', 'really', 'keeps', 'reaching', 'soaring', 'heights', 'normally', 'would', 'like', 'One', 'Day', 'More', 'song', 'most', 'affected', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'Red', 'Black', 'Do', 'Hear', 'People', 'Sing', 'are', 'equally', 'watered', 'saving', 'grace', 'disc', 'finale', 'show', 'bring', 'back', 'original', '1985', 'cast', 'One', 'Day', 'More', 'had', 'leaping', 'seat', 'Also', 'original', 'Valjean', 'sing', 'Bring', 'Him', 'Home', 'contemporary', 'was', 'quite', 'stirring', 'Having', 'Michael', 'Ball', 'stage', 'reprising', 'role', 'Marius', 'reminded', 'how', 'should', 'have', 'are', 'things', 'disc', 'are', 'magical', 'worth', 'owning', 'whole', 'was', 'flawed', 'opinion.So', 'end', 'result', 'will', 'be', 'keeping', 'blu', 'ray', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'Samantha', 'Banks', 'however', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'ordering', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'DVD', 'finally', 'been', 're-released', 'being', 'print', 'many', 'years.My', 'wish', 'said', 'title', 'review', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Concert', 'got', 'blu', 'ray', 'treatment']",N/A

I agree with the previous reviewer about Lea Solonga as Fantine; not quite as full as Ruthie Henshall. Cosette and Eponine were equally represented in their characters.  Nick Jonas was merely OK in singing, and stiff in the acting.  As was stated in other reviews, he was outclassed by the magnificence of the rest of the cast.

While Colm Wilkinson will always be THE Jean Valjean for me, I think that Alfie Boe has an astonishing voice and tremendous stage presence.  A few quibbles--while I disagree with whoever said they don't feel that Lea Salonga's voice was powerful enough for the role of Fantine (I thought she was fantastic, as always), I cannot imagine who thought that casting pop star Nick Jonas as Marius was a good idea.  His voice doesn't begin to hold up against the powerhouses around him, which weakens the production sadly--he is simply overshadowed, especially by the actor cast as Enjolras, who blows him away whenever they sing together.

I cried several times during the production, and found myself rewatching it almost constantly for a week. It was a wonderful tribute to the musical, and well worth the purchase.A small warning: this is a concert performance. As I've not seen the actual play, I can't say what dialogue or songs may be missing, but the acting in this performance is minimal - the cast stand at microphones throughout the concert.

Fine Costumes.What struck me was the way the characters, the values, and the situations assumed their archetypical dimensions.  The stylized, unrealistic presentation; the posing, rather than acting (except the innkeeper couple); the way characters died by closing their eyes and walking out of the spotlight -- all of these worked to show that the characters were not particularly individuals, but were types, types who are always among us.  The clash of values is equally archetypical: the greed for gain of the innkeepers who reappear in different guises -- reminds me of Milo Minderbinder in Catch 22; the vengeful anger of the early Valjean, and of the whoremonger; the selfless love of the bishop, of the converted Valjean and Marius' friend; and the rigid, unyielding sense of justice without love of Jouvert.  All of these values are ALWAYS clashing, competing for our loyalty.Only a genius of Victor Hugo's caliber could present these archetypes in such an appealing, compelling story.  But this production does justice to the archetypes.  Indeed, it goes far beyong merely doing justice.  At the ""end"" of the show, the composers, the great librettist, and the producer came out to join the cast after the curtain calls.  This sense of Les Miserables just running perpetually through human time was enhanced, first by cast members from earlier productions coming out and singing numbers from the show, then by young persons who will be in future productions coming down the aisle singing.The whole thing was at least as much a celebration as a show.  Love wins, Justice -- self-convicted -- loses.Years ago I saw another Les Miserables which put me in touch of the eternal archetypes in Hugo's masterpiece.  It is the French film by Claude LeLouch, starring Jean-Paul Belmondo as two incarnations of Valjean.

But I have some issues with this 25th anniversary edition of the musical. Number 1: NICK JONAS!!!! A Jonas Brother playing Marius???? A role made hugely famous by Micheal Ball, the only thing Nick Jonas had going for him was his looks! He is a rock star and singer, clearly not broadway or even London's west end! I'm not saying I'd be against anyone else in that role, but was very disappointed in the choice. Strike 1 for Les Miserables. Second, the only veterans to return to the Les Miserables universe for this performace were Jenny Galloway and Lea Salonga. And Salonga wasn't even Eponine here! The only reprisal was from Galloway who portrayed the innkeeper's wife. I will say though, Lea Salonga's performance of Fantine was off the chain and if I couldn't see her Eponine return, this was the role to do. Bravo. Also, what in the holy hades happened to Little People???? The song sung by little Gavroche that uncovered Javert and proved that even the smallest can be the biggest. For shame Les Miz. You extend certain songs, but cut out fan favorites?Alfie Boe - A worthy successor to Colm Wilkinson who originated the Jean Valjean role. His voice just resonated and made you want to follow his story.The only other thing for me that made this version worth watching in repetition is after the finale plays. This is the point where 3 of the dominant versions of the cast got recognized. Primarily the original brodway cast that featured Colm Wilkinson and Michael Ball, both whom I mentioned earlier. Plus, the four Valjeans unite and sing a melodious version of Bring Him Home, and the nostalgia is rounded out by the original broadway cast belting out One Day More.This is worthy of picking up, but if you want a repeat watch, go for the Dream Cast that happened for it's 10th anniversary.",4,Where Do I Begin?,1306454400,"05 27, 2011",2011,1920,"['am', 'total', 'fan', 'spectacular', 'musical', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'reached', '25', 'year', 'pinnacle', 'have', 'issues', '25th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'musical', 'Number', '1', 'NICK', 'JONAS', 'Jonas', 'Brother', 'playing', 'Marius', 'role', 'made', 'hugely', 'famous', 'Micheal', 'Ball', 'only', 'thing', 'Nick', 'Jonas', 'had', 'going', 'was', 'looks', 'rock', 'star', 'singer', 'clearly', 'not', 'broadway', 'even', 'London', 'west', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""'d"", 'be', 'anyone', 'else', 'role', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'choice', 'Strike', '1', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'Second', 'only', 'veterans', 'return', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'universe', 'performace', 'were', 'Jenny', 'Galloway', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'Salonga', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'Eponine', 'here', 'only', 'reprisal', 'was', 'Galloway', 'who', 'portrayed', 'innkeeper', 'wife', 'will', 'say', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'performance', 'Fantine', 'was', 'chain', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'Eponine', 'return', 'was', 'role', 'do', 'Bravo', 'Also', 'what', 'holy', 'hades', 'happened', 'Little', 'People', 'song', 'sung', 'little', 'Gavroche', 'uncovered', 'Javert', 'proved', 'even', 'smallest', 'can', 'be', 'biggest', 'shame', 'Les', 'Miz', 'extend', 'certain', 'songs', 'cut', 'out', 'fan', 'favorites', 'Alfie', 'Boe', 'worthy', 'successor', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'originated', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'role', 'voice', 'just', 'resonated', 'made', 'want', 'follow', 'story.The', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'made', 'version', 'worth', 'watching', 'repetition', 'finale', 'point', 'where', '3', 'dominant', 'versions', 'cast', 'got', 'recognized', 'Primarily', 'original', 'brodway', 'cast', 'featured', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'Michael', 'Ball', 'whom', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'four', 'Valjeans', 'unite', 'sing', 'melodious', 'version', 'Bring', 'Him', 'Home', 'nostalgia', 'rounded', 'out', 'original', 'broadway', 'cast', 'belting', 'out', 'One', 'Day', 'More.This', 'worthy', 'picking', 'up', 'want', 'repeat', 'watch', 'go', 'Dream', 'Cast', 'happened', '10th', 'anniversary']",N/A

I concur with fellow reviewer Philip Wells who wrote, ""Nick Jonas is a complete distraction in this show. His Marius has none of the depth that previous performers have given that role."" I could not agree him with more.  Pop star Jonas Brother Nick singlehandedly ruined the 25th anniversary performance. His voice was embarrassing as was his delicate, almost hesitant, overall performance. I also agree with Philip Wells who mentioned that when they finally brought out the 1985 cast, Colm Wilkinson he triumphed.  His voice was so astounding singing Bring Him Home that, although the three other Jean Valjeans sang too, it was Colm Wilkinson's song alone right up until the last pure high note which only Wilkinson could achieve and hold perfectly for so long. The greatest strength of the 25th Anniversary Cast was  Norm Lewis as Javert. Lewis' immense strength, expression, intensity, posture and clarity of voice made it clear Norm Lewis is the epitome of the conflicted Inspector Javert. While the greatest Jean Valjean will always be Colm Wilkinson,  Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean gave an exceedingly strong performance despite looking a bit young; but then he wasn't in charge of make-up so he cannot be blamed for that. His presence, expressions, and above all, voice made him a great choice for the 25th Anniversary Concert.Robert Madge as Gavroche is outstanding! Such energy, such talent, such adorable smirks! (too Bad ""Little People"" and Gavroche's brief death scene were omitted.) Ramin Karimloo as Enjolras made a great heartthrob but it was the commitment in his powerful voice that made him the premier student rebel leader. Karimloo was clearly a ideal casting choice.Finally, the lighting in this production was the most outstanding innovation; it being so effective that it gave the show a great dramatic effect only seen the stage version (and hopefully will be seen in the promised film.)If you can deal with a pale imitation of Marius, buy this Blu-ray for the show including the postlude providing music with the current London cast, the original 1985 cast, the 25th Anniversary  Concert cast and the the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary touring production.",4,"Best of Les Miz, Worst of Les Miz",1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,2399,"['Blu-ray', 'disk', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'linkLes', 'Miserables', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Concert', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Norm', 'Lewis', 'Javert', 'one', 'worst', 'performances', 'Nick', 'Jonas', 'Marius', 'concur', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'Philip', 'Wells', 'who', 'wrote', 'Nick', 'Jonas', 'complete', 'distraction', 'show', 'Marius', 'none', 'depth', 'previous', 'performers', 'have', 'given', 'role', 'could', 'not', 'agree', 'more', 'Pop', 'star', 'Jonas', 'Brother', 'Nick', 'singlehandedly', 'ruined', '25th', 'anniversary', 'performance', 'voice', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'was', 'delicate', 'almost', 'hesitant', 'overall', 'performance', 'also', 'agree', 'Philip', 'Wells', 'who', 'mentioned', 'when', 'finally', 'brought', 'out', '1985', 'cast', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'triumphed', 'voice', 'was', 'so', 'astounding', 'singing', 'Bring', 'Him', 'Home', 'three', 'other', 'Jean', 'Valjeans', 'sang', 'too', 'was', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'song', 'alone', 'right', 'up', 'last', 'pure', 'high', 'note', 'only', 'Wilkinson', 'could', 'achieve', 'hold', 'perfectly', 'so', 'long', 'greatest', 'strength', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Cast', 'was', 'Norm', 'Lewis', 'Javert', 'Lewis', 'immense', 'strength', 'expression', 'intensity', 'posture', 'clarity', 'voice', 'made', 'clear', 'Norm', 'Lewis', 'epitome', 'conflicted', 'Inspector', 'Javert', 'greatest', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'Alfie', 'Boe', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'gave', 'exceedingly', 'strong', 'performance', 'looking', 'bit', 'young', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'charge', 'make-up', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'blamed', 'presence', 'expressions', 'voice', 'made', 'great', 'choice', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Concert.Robert', 'Madge', 'Gavroche', 'outstanding', 'Such', 'energy', 'such', 'talent', 'such', 'adorable', 'smirks', 'too', 'Bad', 'Little', 'People', 'Gavroche', 'brief', 'death', 'scene', 'were', 'omitted', 'Ramin', 'Karimloo', 'Enjolras', 'made', 'great', 'heartthrob', 'was', 'commitment', 'powerful', 'voice', 'made', 'premier', 'student', 'rebel', 'leader', 'Karimloo', 'was', 'clearly', 'ideal', 'casting', 'choice.Finally', 'lighting', 'production', 'was', 'most', 'outstanding', 'innovation', 'being', 'so', 'effective', 'gave', 'show', 'great', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'only', 'seen', 'stage', 'version', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'promised', 'film', 'can', 'deal', 'pale', 'imitation', 'Marius', 'buy', 'Blu-ray', 'show', 'including', 'postlude', 'providing', 'music', 'current', 'London', 'cast', 'original', '1985', 'cast', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Concert', 'cast', 'Twenty-Fifth', 'Anniversary', 'touring', 'production']",N/A

I've seen 5 different casts in full productions, have the original London and Broadway cast recordings, as well as the ""complete symphonic"" recording (my personal favorite), and the 10th anniversary edition - and now this one.  I enjoy all of them for different reasons, and my personal ""dream cast"" would be a mix from all of the above.  There is one individual performance that I will comment on because everyone else has, and that is Nick Jonas.  Personally, I liked his reading of the part. Going as far back as the novel, Marius is the young innocent schoolboy who got caught up with the fanatics of the ABC Club (i.e. the other students). Jonas' youth coupled with his admittedly low-power voice gave Marious a sense of vulnerability that is frequently lacking in this belt-fest of a score. One other musical note is that I agree with the previous post about the poorly mixed ""One Day More"".  This is one of the most amazing ensemble pieces ever written for the musical stage, but it only works if all the voices are balanced.  The ""complete symphonic"" recording is the only one that seems to have gotten this right.My four-star rating comes from the fact that once again the producers cut portions of the score.  It was ""more complete"" than the markedly trimmed 10th anniversary concert, but still... To go to all of the expense to put this concert together, why not do it completely unedited to have a video record of the full score?  Of course, better yet, why not record an actual stage performance and make it available on video? In some respects, the 10th anniversary was superior in that it at least had videos of stage performances displayed in certain crucial scenes. One of the most powerful images from the modern musical stage comes during the ""Bring Him Home"" instrumental when the barricade revolves to reveal all of the dead students and the fallen flag.  Close-ups of the orchestra just don't do this justice.But all that said, the technical brilliance of this recording will keep me coming back for many more viewings...",4,Another very good concert - but why not the whole show?,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,2115,"['Different', 'casts', 'have', 'different', 'interpretations', 'just', 'how', ""'ve"", 'seen', '5', 'different', 'casts', 'full', 'productions', 'have', 'original', 'London', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'recordings', 'as', 'well', 'complete', 'symphonic', 'recording', 'personal', 'favorite', '10th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'now', 'one', 'enjoy', 'different', 'reasons', 'personal', 'dream', 'cast', 'would', 'be', 'mix', 'above', 'one', 'individual', 'performance', 'will', 'comment', 'everyone', 'else', 'Nick', 'Jonas', 'Personally', 'liked', 'reading', 'part', 'Going', 'far', 'back', 'novel', 'Marius', 'young', 'innocent', 'schoolboy', 'who', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'fanatics', 'ABC', 'Club', 'i.e', 'other', 'students', 'Jonas', 'youth', 'coupled', 'admittedly', 'low-power', 'voice', 'gave', 'Marious', 'sense', 'vulnerability', 'frequently', 'lacking', 'belt-fest', 'score', 'One', 'other', 'musical', 'note', 'agree', 'previous', 'post', 'poorly', 'mixed', 'One', 'Day', 'More', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'ensemble', 'pieces', 'ever', 'written', 'musical', 'stage', 'only', 'voices', 'are', 'balanced', 'complete', 'symphonic', 'recording', 'only', 'one', 'have', 'gotten', 'right.My', 'four-star', 'rating', 'fact', 'once', 'again', 'producers', 'cut', 'portions', 'score', 'was', 'more', 'complete', 'markedly', 'trimmed', '10th', 'anniversary', 'concert', 'still', 'go', 'expense', 'put', 'concert', 'together', 'why', 'not', 'do', 'completely', 'unedited', 'have', 'video', 'record', 'full', 'score', 'course', 'better', 'yet', 'why', 'not', 'record', 'actual', 'stage', 'performance', 'make', 'available', 'video', 'respects', '10th', 'anniversary', 'was', 'superior', 'least', 'had', 'videos', 'stage', 'performances', 'displayed', 'certain', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'One', 'most', 'powerful', 'images', 'modern', 'musical', 'stage', 'Bring', 'Him', 'Home', 'instrumental', 'when', 'barricade', 'reveal', 'dead', 'students', 'fallen', 'flag', 'Close-ups', 'orchestra', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice.But', 'said', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'recording', 'will', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'many', 'more', 'viewings']",N/A
