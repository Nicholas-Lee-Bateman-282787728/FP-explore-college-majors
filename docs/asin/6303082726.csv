Naturally I thought of my other favorite reincarnated dog-person movie, &quot;Fluke,&quot; which was made 2 years after this film. So I rented the Hallmark video and watched it. The story was original, touching, and moved quickly enough. It was sweet and mysterious but simple enough to understand. It wasn't at all a bore. I loved it. The old man was endearing, the dog was gorgeous, the children were annoyingly caring, it had romance and suspense and sadness. This movie was truly worth it.

355033,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6303082726,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[30, 30]","When Sam's beloved wife Cora tells him she will always be there for him, she keeps her promise. After being married for 50 years, Cora has a heart attack and leaves Sam alone dealing with his own ailing health, or so he thinks.When a beautiful white dog appears, everyone starts to worry. The white dog is only visible to Sam. Slowly the dog becomes visible to all the family members. When Sam is in trouble, the white dog is always there for him.In a movie dealing with the issue of life and death, I found it insightful of the writers to describe death as a new adventure instead of an ending. Unlike the movie ""Dad,"" this movie is not sad from the start to finish and is much more upbeat. The humor is laugh out loud throughout. His two daughters are always worrying about their dad and get themselves into quite a funny predicament. Life should be filled with humor and good times.Death is sad because we feel sorry for ourselves and miss the relationship we had. The person leaving this life is starting on their new spiritual journey in eternity. Hume Cronyn gives an inspirational performance and seems to have brought much of his own wisdom to the character of Sam. Character is something that makes an actor good. It is conveyed through the acting and is never masked by it.Watching this type of movie will help you to discover your own feelings and beliefs about real-life issues and it will deepen your awareness to those around you who need your love and attention. When it comes down to it, Sam has his family and his beliefs. His wisdom seems to guide him in life and he looks for the good in life.When you seek out good in life, it keeps finding you!~The Rebecca Review",5,"The start of a new adventure, not a ending...",986428800,"04 5, 2001",2001,1684,"['When', 'Sam', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Cora', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'promise', 'being', 'married', '50', 'years', 'Cora', 'heart', 'attack', 'Sam', 'alone', 'dealing', 'own', 'ailing', 'health', 'so', 'beautiful', 'white', 'dog', 'everyone', 'worry', 'white', 'dog', 'only', 'visible', 'Sam', 'Slowly', 'dog', 'visible', 'family', 'members', 'When', 'Sam', 'trouble', 'white', 'dog', 'always', 'him.In', 'movie', 'dealing', 'issue', 'life', 'death', 'found', 'insightful', 'writers', 'describe', 'death', 'new', 'adventure', 'instead', 'ending', 'movie', 'Dad', 'movie', 'not', 'sad', 'start', 'finish', 'much', 'more', 'upbeat', 'humor', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'two', 'daughters', 'are', 'always', 'worrying', 'dad', 'get', 'quite', 'funny', 'predicament', 'Life', 'should', 'be', 'filled', 'humor', 'good', 'times.Death', 'sad', 'feel', 'sorry', 'ourselves', 'miss', 'relationship', 'had', 'person', 'leaving', 'life', 'starting', 'new', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'eternity', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'inspirational', 'performance', 'have', 'brought', 'much', 'own', 'wisdom', 'character', 'Sam', 'Character', 'something', 'actor', 'good', 'conveyed', 'acting', 'never', 'masked', 'it.Watching', 'type', 'movie', 'will', 'help', 'discover', 'own', 'feelings', 'beliefs', 'real-life', 'issues', 'will', 'deepen', 'awareness', 'who', 'need', 'love', 'attention', 'When', 'down', 'Sam', 'family', 'beliefs', 'wisdom', 'guide', 'life', 'good', 'life.When', 'seek', 'out', 'good', 'life', 'finding', '~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",To Dance with the White Dog VHS

355037,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,6303082726,Tsuyoshi,"[41, 42]","Sometimes a work ""made for TV"" suffers from cast from B minus List, and cheesy-quicky idea borrowed from somewhere else -- like a huge meteo coming from the outer space -- but very often it produces a genuinely good one, and now here's one for you.Sam and Cora is a typical American husband and wife, long lived in a country pecan farm in Georgia, with daughters near them and sons already got their own jobs.  But now Sam is left alone, after a death of his wife, but he finds a new friend in a white dog which seems to come out of nowhere.  But one strange thing is that though Sam can see her, touch her, feed her, and even dance with her, no one else doesn't seem to see  this dog.  Is it his illusion?  Or something else?Terry Kay's original book is treated with a subtle touch to realize a magic feeling in an ordinary life, and the relations  between his worried family members and confident Sam himself are marvelously drawn with a snappy dialogues.  Naturally, the acting from the two veterans is always first-rate, with Hume Cronyn as Sam (who got Emmy Award), and Jessica Tandy as Cora (nominated for Emmy but with a little more screen time, she could have won).  And the fact that these actors were really married for a long time, and by the time of shooting this film Jessica tandy got a diagnosis as having cancer makes the whole picture more precious and gives a bitter-sweet taste to it.The latter part of the film is, frankly speaking, I found a bit weak, the story being streched (especailly the episode about the river should be deleted, being out of tune), and the film tends to speak the things that should be left unsaid.  The final result, however, is more than satisfactory, proving that those veteran actors are true American cinematic treasures.  Recommended.By the way, the original book has become suddenly a bestseller in Japan in 2001 and 2002, and more than 1.5 million copies have been  sold.  And to capitalize in the popularity, they quickly made a film of this book with all-Japanese cast.",5,Have You Seen a White Dog Dancing with Your Father?,1020556800,"05 5, 2002",2002,2024,"['Sometimes', 'work', 'made', 'TV', 'suffers', 'cast', 'B', 'List', 'cheesy-quicky', 'idea', 'borrowed', 'somewhere', 'else', 'huge', 'meteo', 'coming', 'outer', 'space', 'very', 'often', 'genuinely', 'good', 'one', 'now', 'here', 'one', 'you.Sam', 'Cora', 'typical', 'American', 'husband', 'wife', 'long', 'lived', 'country', 'pecan', 'farm', 'Georgia', 'daughters', 'sons', 'already', 'got', 'own', 'jobs', 'now', 'Sam', 'left', 'alone', 'death', 'wife', 'new', 'friend', 'white', 'dog', 'come', 'nowhere', 'one', 'strange', 'thing', 'Sam', 'can', 'see', 'touch', 'feed', 'even', 'dance', 'one', 'else', ""n't"", 'seem', 'see', 'dog', 'illusion', 'something', 'else', 'Terry', 'Kay', 'original', 'book', 'treated', 'subtle', 'touch', 'realize', 'magic', 'feeling', 'ordinary', 'life', 'relations', 'worried', 'family', 'members', 'confident', 'Sam', 'are', 'marvelously', 'drawn', 'snappy', 'dialogues', 'Naturally', 'acting', 'two', 'veterans', 'always', 'first-rate', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'Sam', 'who', 'got', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'Cora', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'little', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'won', 'fact', 'actors', 'were', 'really', 'married', 'long', 'time', 'time', 'shooting', 'film', 'Jessica', 'tandy', 'got', 'diagnosis', 'having', 'cancer', 'whole', 'picture', 'more', 'precious', 'bitter-sweet', 'taste', 'it.The', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'frankly', 'speaking', 'found', 'bit', 'weak', 'story', 'being', 'streched', 'especailly', 'episode', 'river', 'should', 'be', 'deleted', 'being', 'tune', 'film', 'speak', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'unsaid', 'final', 'result', 'however', 'more', 'satisfactory', 'proving', 'veteran', 'actors', 'are', 'true', 'American', 'cinematic', 'treasures', 'Recommended.By', 'way', 'original', 'book', 'become', 'suddenly', 'bestseller', 'Japan', '2001', '2002', 'more', '1.5', 'million', 'copies', 'have', 'been', 'sold', 'capitalize', 'popularity', 'quickly', 'made', 'film', 'book', 'all-Japanese', 'cast']",To Dance with the White Dog VHS
