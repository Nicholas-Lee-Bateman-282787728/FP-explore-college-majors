1014971,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B000HIVIXI,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[8, 9]","This film basically sucks! There is one incredible looking young German guy (Erik) that is awesome to watch and he's the only reason I stayed with this thing through to the end. Amazon's editorial review was extremely misleading. It would imply that ""Saved by the Bell's"" A.C. and Zach were in this film and locking lips and loins on the white beaches of Brazil. If that took place even remotely in this film, I totally missed it. The cast is made up of three German guys, one of which as I already stated is BEAUTIFUL, and the acting appeared to be fair, if you could understand what was supposed to be happening. The actors done good with the very poor script they were given to work with, especially the lead actor who accidentally murders a man in self defence. The potential was definitely there throughout this thing, but it didn't even attempt to live up to that potential.The music sucked bigtime! The subtitles were difficult to understand, and there needed to be subtitles for the very poor English parts of the film that the viewer is expected to understand. A very hard film to follow, and where it leads is not a place you will enjoy going. Right when it appears there is finally going to be a plot, the movie ends suddenly with a ""no ending"" end. Beautiful Brazilian landscape and hot young actors are about all this film has going for it. I have no idea who was longing for something or what they were longing for. Thus the name ""The Longing"" was ill conceived at best. I do not recommend this one, unless you simply want to see some nice footage of a very gorgeous young blonde German boy that is super hot. If only they would show more than 3 seconds of him nude, it might make this film worth the buy.",1,I am LONGING for this film to have a plot!,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,1719,"['film', 'basically', 'one', 'incredible', 'looking', 'young', 'German', 'guy', 'Erik', 'awesome', 'watch', 'only', 'reason', 'stayed', 'thing', 'end', 'Amazon', 'editorial', 'review', 'was', 'extremely', 'misleading', 'would', 'imply', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'A.C.', 'Zach', 'were', 'film', 'locking', 'lips', 'loins', 'white', 'beaches', 'Brazil', 'took', 'place', 'even', 'remotely', 'film', 'totally', 'missed', 'cast', 'made', 'three', 'German', 'guys', 'one', 'already', 'stated', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'acting', 'appeared', 'be', 'fair', 'could', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'happening', 'actors', 'done', 'good', 'very', 'poor', 'script', 'were', 'given', 'work', 'especially', 'lead', 'actor', 'who', 'accidentally', 'man', 'self', 'defence', 'potential', 'was', 'definitely', 'there', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'live', 'up', 'potential.The', 'music', 'sucked', 'bigtime', 'subtitles', 'were', 'difficult', 'understand', 'there', 'needed', 'be', 'subtitles', 'very', 'poor', 'English', 'parts', 'film', 'viewer', 'expected', 'understand', 'very', 'hard', 'film', 'follow', 'where', 'not', 'place', 'will', 'enjoy', 'going', 'Right', 'when', 'finally', 'going', 'be', 'plot', 'movie', 'suddenly', 'ending', 'end', 'Beautiful', 'Brazilian', 'landscape', 'hot', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'film', 'going', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'was', 'longing', 'something', 'what', 'were', 'longing', 'Thus', 'name', 'Longing', 'was', 'ill', 'conceived', 'best', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'one', 'simply', 'want', 'see', 'nice', 'footage', 'very', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'blonde', 'German', 'boy', 'super', 'hot', 'only', 'would', 'show', 'more', '3', 'seconds', 'nude', 'might', 'make', 'film', 'buy']",The Longing
1014972,AAPFN1BADMWMC,B000HIVIXI,"Giancarlo Croce ""Offer VOID where prohibited""","[2, 2]","Three Gay, German guys are living in Brazil. One has a rich father. One is a failed rapper. One is a failed investment banker. None of them can act. The failed banker falls in love with a black soap opera actor, after accidentally killing his brother. Naturally they break up after the murder is confessed. Wow, what a plot twist.A major scene consists of a Black Brazilian who is ranting about how badly blacks are regarded in Brazil, and that Gay Black Brazilians are treated even worse. The reason for the rant is unclear, and the whole scene seems to be more of a showcase for two twitchy drag queens who don't seem to be interested in anything but getting to the bar and doing their show.There's no beginning to the story. There's no complicated plot. There's no sex (Just one brief nude scene). There's no action. There's not a clear conclusion to the story. The filming was done in a gorgeous location that could have been the highlight of the film, if it had been shown, but it wasn't. The best part of the whole thing is the 'special feature' about the making of the film, where everyone complains about the location, makes excuses for the lousy acting, and admits the film is poorly cast and badly written.The director says he didn't want to make an intellectual movie. I think he succeeded in that.The film stinks as bad as the actors say Brazil stinks.

1014973,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000HIVIXI,Grady Harp,"[11, 16]","'Saudade - Sehnsucht' (THE LONGING) is a film by writer/director J&uuml;rgen Br&uuml;ning who seems to have taken a vacation from Germany to Brazil with some friends and decided to make a movie as a means of entertainment.  This film is less about characters and story development than it is about Brazilian beaches, snorkeling, fish butchering, second-rate pop music, and food.Ostensibly we find three friends who've had a rock band in Germany on vacation in Brazil: Cyrus (Tarik Qazi) is interested in finding his Brazilian mother; Tim (Daniel B&auml;tscher) remains determined to explore a new music sound; Erik (eye candy hunk Hendrik Scheider) wants to find love.  The three finance their excursion by making daily film clips of body contact to use on the internet dating business.  Their housekeepers Maria (Maria Lucia da Silva Ludwig) and Angela (Marilza da Cruz Pinto Gregio) feed their interests as well as their appetites.  Most of their time is spent in clubs and at the beaches, pursuing little but opportunism.  Erik has a tryst on the sand with a Brazilian man one night that ends in a death that sours his desire.  When another attractive Brazilian lad Miguel (Aldri Anunciao) catches Erik's eye the two begin a struggle for a relationship, but Erik's previous encounter colors his ability to find happiness.The actors are all attractive and given the fact that they have little to do but look alluring manage to make the film tolerable.  But in the end the movie feels too self indulgent to satisfy any audience member.  It is a piece of fluff disguised as a soap opera.
