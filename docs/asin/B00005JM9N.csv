She is, indeed, a great vocalist. Guarini, on the other hand, pales in comparison. Crooning along side Kelly doesn't really do Justin any good.

What I got was a straight-laced musical with no real bite or charm.  It is predictable, clich&eacute;d, amateurish and forgettable (thankfully).  I'm really glad that the whole idea behind this `get rich quick' scheme was trashed after the first season of the show, although a gritty Carrie Underwood/Bo Bice barroom romp may have been entertaining.  With a plot that is as dense as can be imagined (jealous girl wrecks havoc on goodie-two-shoes summer romance) and acting that will make you squirm, it's a shame that the musical numbers weren't more engaging.  With all that this film blatantly DIDN'T have going for it, the one thing it should have provided was memorable music.  Instead, this feels like a cheap variation of a boring MTV show (you know, the kind where scantily clad teenagers bump and grind to Top 40 hits), the only difference is that these songs aren't catchy.

614797,A3SLAN3304WRIF,B00005JM9N,anonymous,"[0, 0]","I remember watching this movie ten years ago in theaters a little kid. I was a big fan of American Idol at the time, and I was very excited seeing it. Well it did not disappoint. I loved it. I remember having such a fun time at the movie, and feeling really happy afterwards. But kids will like almost movie that isn't ridiculously boring.So lets fast forward ten years later. I have probably watched close to a thousand other movies, old and new, since From Justin to Kelly. And I still find Justin to Kelly rather charming. Sure it's not the best movie in the world. But it's still a good movie. It's actually quite fun.For me, there is a lot of nostalgia attached to it. Watching this takes me back to middle school, and all the good memories I had back then. Also it reminds me of when American Idol was still in it's glory days, and not the joke it is today. I was such a huge fan of American Idol, and it's such a shame to see what has become of it. It's not the same show that I loved watching growing up.Overall, if you didn't watch this as kid, and there is no nostalgia attached to it, there's no reason to watch it now. You've seen this plot over and over. But the movie is still fun, and a good time.

614798,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B00005JM9N,Brian A. Schar,"[2, 5]","I must preface this review by stating that I despise ""American Idol"" and all it stands for. I would never have bothered to watch this movie, had not a friend's daughter lent it to us, saying that it's so awful it's funny. Oh, was she right!  This film is a fiasco in every way, from direction and choreography all the way down the line to costuming and makeup.The movie begins like a horror film, as a Japanese-style quick zoom takes us in way too close to Kelly belting out some song in a redneck bar. The very first shot of this movie establishes not the story, or the location, but the utter incompetence of this production. First, the lighting and makeup in this first shot is atrocious, and the zoom gets _way too close_ to Kelly.  They say the camera adds 10 pounds, but in this case horrible lighting and makeup adds even more. Second, on the commentary track, the director laughs about how this shot took a lot of takes to do right because the crane didn't work right. Crane? There is no need to use a crane for this shot. In fact, the shot looks like a camera was set on a tripod in front of her to her right and swiveled from her out to the single hick in the audience. There's nothing wrong with that shot, or that setup - it's easy and gets the job done. But the director chose a _crane_ for that simple shot! Indeed, in the special features, you see cranes and steadicam operators all over the place, but the finished product has no fancy or even interesting camera work that you'd expect to result from the use of all that hardware.Deep breath. OK. The song is terrible, with that inexplicably-popular warbling around the notes that never quite hits them. At least Kelly has volume. So she's the Good Girl waitress at this hick bar. Her ""friends"" come in, and it's apparent from the first 10 seconds that one is the Slutty Southern Aristocrat and the other is the Smart One. (Helpfully, they _actually say this_ about each other later in the movie, as if we didn't get the stereotypes from square one.) Next thing you know, they're all on the road to Spring Break in Miami. And we, the viewers, realize to our horror that we're about to see ""Coyote Ugly"" meets ""Where the Boys Are."" And not the good ""Where the Boys Are,"" either, but the bad one from 1984 with Lisa Hartman.Upon arriving in Miami, the girls get Movie Parking right across the street from the beach, and, leaving their luggage unsecured in the back of their pickup, run across the street and immediately get swept up in impromptu beach Hip-Pop. Two things. First, the ""choreography"" of this movie is atrocious. There are always huge masses of people, most of which are out of sync with one another, and some of which are just doing whatever during the song. Second, in the commentary the director claims that this is the first use of hip-hop in a musical. ?? Let the record reflect the existence of the far-goofier ""You Got Served."" And ""Rent.""Anyway, Kelly and Justin make puppy dog eyes at each other for 15 seconds and immediately fall in love, and then are separated. We meet Justin's friends, who are equally stereotypical as Kelly's. The Dork! The Stud! Great. Smart Girl meets a Cuban waiter, the best actor in this mess, and he makes the mistake of taking her to a Cuban dance club. A mistake, in the sense that we actually get some good music and dancing, reminding us of the cesspool that is the remainder of FJTK.The next day, the girls go to the whipped cream bikini party put on by Justin and his buddy. This is in part because Slutty Southern Aristocrat is trying to ""steal"" Justin from Kelly. Kelly utters the immortal words: ""It's humiliating! And degrading!"" Just like this movie. For the first time, we see just how little chemistry Justin and Kelly have.The movie slows down a lot, and Kelly gets to sing a song in a terrible dress that adds 10+ pounds, with her hair done like some kind of weird bird feathers. It is both funny and horrifying to watch both the costuming and hair of her character degenerate throughout the movie.  It is as if the production simply gave up halfway through.Slutty Southern Aristocrat calls up the hick from the first scene and tells him to get to Miami, so he and Justin are going to fight over Kelly. Instead, they have a hovercraft fight. I'm not making this up. That is the loopiest, craziest thing in the movie, and even that is filmed and executed so lackadaisically that a _hovercraft fight_ becomes tedious!Afterwards, J & K go on a ""date"" that involves some boating. It is clear in this scene that Justin's touch repulses Kelly. They have anti-chemistry. This really interferes with the premise of the movie, namely, that they two are soulmates.Then, some stuff happens, and the movie's over. I won't ruin the ending, but if you've ever watched a movie, you can see it coming.  The ""big finale"" possibly has the worst choreography of the entire movie, and the costuming and hair done to Kelly reaches an amazing nadir.This movie is bad like an afterschool special, bad in a lazy kind of way. It's not bad in the sense of ""Xanadu"" (roller-discoing immortal Greek muses) or ""Can't Stop the Music"" (the history of the Village People), which fail spectacularly because of the sheer goofiness of their premises. FJTK is bad in a way that will cause it and its stars to be forgotten well before 2010.  Save your money and avoid at all costs.",1,"""It's humiliating!

Sure, it's silly, improbable, and goofy beyond all belief (the outfits alone...) but &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot; is also surprisingly sweet and good natured. Our favorite ex-Idolers star as &quot;Justin Bell&quot; and &quot;Kelly Taylor&quot;, two young adults in Florida on Spring Break. Justin is supposed to be a wild party boy, and Kelly is the down home girl from Texas (she is described at one point as &quot;one bonnet short of Amish&quot;). They meet, have an instant connection, and spend the whole movie overcoming various obstacles (mostly Kelly's evil best friend) before finally finding true love.The big surprise here is how natural Clarkson and Guarini are on screen; they read their lines with assurance and ease. There is one good musical number, a couple of decent ones, and one really bad one. The songs are pleasant, and made better by Clarkson's beautiful voice. The dialogue is better than we have any right to expect, and while the pace is leasuirely the film holds your interest.I put this one at about 3.5 stars. If you love Clarkson or Guarini, rent it. If you're fifteen and having a slumber party, buy it.

Immediately, everyone else sees that you are IT and all voluntarily become back-up dancers and side-players in your own unfolding drama.  You meet the best looking potential mate imaginable.  You ""connect"" with little more than a glance.  You dance the night away but then break-up the next day.....he/she's ""not who you thought they were"".  In a resounding rout for all things right and good, you make-up the next day, vow to never part even though you live on opposite sides of the country and end the vacation with a snappy song &amp; dance number by the hotel pool in which all eyes are on you and your handsome soul-mate.....everyone else mimicking your gyrations with such amazing sync that it's almost as if everyone in the world were a mere extension of you and what you're thinking.Those were the days, were they not?  Now, I wouldn't even take my shirt off by a pool, much less imagine starting a gravity-defying group dance and sing-along  that no one can resist joining in on.  The best scene in this movie was when Justin and Kelly finally got together away from all of their sycophants, got on a white boat with both of them wearing white linen clothing....and yodel their feelings to each other as Justin steered them into a blazing sunset.I'll have to give this 3 stars on its own merits.

614804,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B00005JM9N,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[0, 0]","Okay I did it.  I'm not quite sure why.  But I think it's that I like to look at car wrecks.  I like to see people fall on their heads, and I sometimes (but rarely admit it) think the greatest moment I ever saw on television was when Shannon [of CBS's Big Brother 2] took Hardy's toothbrush and used it in the toilet. It was after that reality TV just took a dive for me and I never looked back.  Well, that was until Justin and Kelly made a movie. I couldn't resist the urge and I rented it.But how do you review a movie like this?  It's a given that it's a piece of junk.  You will waste 80 minutes of your life if you sit through it.  It has stupid characters, bad acting, and some of the worst music ever written in it.  Let's put it this way, Crossroads deserved 16 academy awards compared to this piece of dreck. So here's what I'm going to do, I'll tell you what I did like about the movie, and then how the rest of it could have been fixed.This film has some of the best opening credits of all time.  Not technically, (That goes to Orson Wells Touch of Evil and Robert Altman's The Player) but artistically.  Instead of silly graphics these credits exist in the real world.  The Credits are written on beach tents, activity signs, and flying off the back of an airplane.  The title graphic is printed on a bridge, instead of superimposed on it.  The art director who came up with that one idea should be praised.  It's the only moment in the film that shows any bit of creativity.  I sometimes wonder if Michelangelo lived today, would he be a commercial artist?  Could he have come up with an idea this creative?  If so, would we have to look at two naked men touching fingers on the ceiling of a church?  Not quite sure but it sure is interesting to hypothesize about it, huh?So as I watched (and killed more brains cells than a heroin addict) I decided I could come up with little hits on how this film could have been easily fixed.  I then came up with idea.  It was an idea so brilliant I'll bet before he died Jim Henson actually thought it.  Hire the Muppets to do this beach movie.  This spring break story of two boring lovers could only work with puppets.  So in the nature of full disclosure I say that Fozzie Bear and Janice of Dr Teeth's Electric Mayhem should have played Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson, respectively.  I can just imagine the Spring break hijinks that could have occurred as poor Fozzie Bear tries to get Janice to fall in love with him.Fozzie could hang out with Link Hogthrob instead of two bit pretty boy Greg Siff, that big brutish pig would be ten times better than the stupid honky they hired, who for some reason thinks he can rap (at least twice in this film).  For your information he as good a rapper as our ole pal Robert Van Winkle.  Although I must admit candidly that Justin Guarini can lay down the beat box as well as I can. Now imagine how funny it would be to see a pig rap, to see a pig pick up girls and get them to shed their clothes and into a whipped cream bikini contest.  That is hilarity.Scooter could have played Justin's nerdy friend, with hilarious effect. Instead, we get an annoying buffoon played by Brian Dietzen.  Dietzen's character keeps searching for a woman he's been talking to on the Internet.  Imagine his surprise if that woman he fell in love with online turned out to be a slimmed down Miss Piggy.As for Janice's friends she could hang out with Zo the monster from SESAME STREET and Zoot, the Electric Mayhem's bad Sax Player in drag.  And while Zo stabs Janice in the back by trying to steal Fozzie away, Zoot can meet a Latino heartthrob named Gonzo and they can of course dance the night away.Finally our favorite cantankerous hero's Statler and Waldorf could narrate the whole movie, those guys are freaking funny. With these simple changes FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY could have become another fine Muppet film.  But alas, I do not get to make any decisions in Hollywood. To the country's detriment I might add.All in all FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY is an exercise in rampant commercialism.  I feel sorry for all the people that worked on this 80-minute music video.  They wasted their time, all for nothing.  In an industry where some great films and wonderful performances are swept under the rug, it's a shame that anybody thought FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY was worth the time and effort.No Stars (Out of 5)",1,Muppet Beach Party,1062547200,"09 3, 2003",2003,4380,"['Okay', 'did', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'think', 'like', 'look', 'car', 'wrecks', 'like', 'see', 'people', 'fall', 'heads', 'sometimes', 'rarely', 'admit', 'think', 'greatest', 'moment', 'ever', 'saw', 'television', 'was', 'when', 'Shannon', '[', 'CBS', 'Big', 'Brother', '2', ']', 'took', 'Hardy', 'toothbrush', 'used', 'toilet', 'was', 'reality', 'TV', 'just', 'took', 'dive', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'Well', 'was', 'Justin', 'Kelly', 'made', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'urge', 'rented', 'it.But', 'how', 'do', 'review', 'movie', 'given', 'piece', 'junk', 'will', 'waste', '80', 'minutes', 'life', 'sit', 'stupid', 'characters', 'bad', 'acting', 'worst', 'music', 'ever', 'written', 'Let', 'put', 'way', 'Crossroads', 'deserved', '16', 'academy', 'awards', 'compared', 'piece', 'dreck', 'here', 'what', ""'m"", 'going', 'do', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'then', 'how', 'rest', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fixed.This', 'film', 'best', 'opening', 'credits', 'time', 'Not', 'technically', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'Touch', 'Evil', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'Player', 'artistically', 'Instead', 'silly', 'graphics', 'credits', 'exist', 'real', 'world', 'Credits', 'are', 'written', 'beach', 'tents', 'activity', 'signs', 'flying', 'off', 'back', 'airplane', 'title', 'graphic', 'printed', 'bridge', 'instead', 'superimposed', 'art', 'director', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'one', 'idea', 'should', 'be', 'praised', 'only', 'moment', 'film', 'bit', 'creativity', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'Michelangelo', 'lived', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'commercial', 'artist', 'Could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'creative', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'look', 'two', 'naked', 'men', 'touching', 'fingers', 'ceiling', 'church', 'Not', 'quite', 'sure', 'sure', 'interesting', 'hypothesize', 'huh', 'So', 'watched', 'killed', 'more', 'brains', 'cells', 'heroin', 'addict', 'decided', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'little', 'hits', 'how', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'fixed', 'then', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'was', 'idea', 'so', 'brilliant', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'died', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'actually', 'thought', 'Hire', 'Muppets', 'do', 'beach', 'movie', 'spring', 'break', 'story', 'two', 'boring', 'lovers', 'could', 'only', 'work', 'puppets', 'So', 'nature', 'full', 'disclosure', 'say', 'Fozzie', 'Bear', 'Janice', 'Dr', 'Teeth', 'Electric', 'Mayhem', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'Justin', 'Guarini', 'Kelly', 'Clarkson', 'respectively', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'Spring', 'break', 'hijinks', 'could', 'have', 'occurred', 'poor', 'Fozzie', 'Bear', 'get', 'Janice', 'fall', 'love', 'him.Fozzie', 'could', 'hang', 'out', 'Link', 'Hogthrob', 'instead', 'two', 'bit', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Greg', 'Siff', 'big', 'brutish', 'pig', 'would', 'be', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'stupid', 'honky', 'hired', 'who', 'reason', 'can', 'rap', 'least', 'twice', 'film', 'information', 'as', 'good', 'rapper', 'ole', 'pal', 'Robert', 'Van', 'Winkle', 'must', 'admit', 'candidly', 'Justin', 'Guarini', 'can', 'lay', 'down', 'beat', 'box', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'Now', 'imagine', 'how', 'funny', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'pig', 'rap', 'see', 'pig', 'pick', 'up', 'girls', 'get', 'shed', 'clothes', 'whipped', 'cream', 'bikini', 'contest', 'hilarity.Scooter', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Justin', 'nerdy', 'friend', 'hilarious', 'effect', 'Instead', 'get', 'annoying', 'buffoon', 'played', 'Brian', 'Dietzen', 'Dietzen', 'character', 'searching', 'woman', 'been', 'talking', 'Internet', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'woman', 'fell', 'love', 'online', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'slimmed', 'down', 'Miss', 'Piggy.As', 'Janice', 'friends', 'could', 'hang', 'out', 'Zo', 'monster', 'SESAME', 'STREET', 'Zoot', 'Electric', 'Mayhem', 'bad', 'Sax', 'Player', 'drag', 'Zo', 'stabs', 'Janice', 'back', 'trying', 'steal', 'Fozzie', 'away', 'Zoot', 'can', 'meet', 'Latino', 'heartthrob', 'named', 'Gonzo', 'can', 'course', 'dance', 'night', 'away.Finally', 'favorite', 'cantankerous', 'hero', 'Statler', 'Waldorf', 'could', 'narrate', 'whole', 'movie', 'guys', 'are', 'freaking', 'funny', 'simple', 'changes', 'FROM', 'JUSTIN', 'TO', 'KELLY', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'fine', 'Muppet', 'film', 'alas', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'make', 'decisions', 'Hollywood', 'country', 'detriment', 'might', 'add.All', 'FROM', 'JUSTIN', 'TO', 'KELLY', 'exercise', 'rampant', 'commercialism', 'feel', 'sorry', 'people', 'worked', '80-minute', 'music', 'video', 'wasted', 'time', 'nothing', 'industry', 'where', 'great', 'films', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'are', 'swept', 'rug', 'shame', 'anybody', 'thought', 'FROM', 'JUSTIN', 'TO', 'KELLY', 'was', 'time', 'effort.No', 'Stars', 'Out', '5']",N/A
614805,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00005JM9N,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 1]","I'm willing to accept that the producers of American Idol didn't quite get the swing of their own material at first.  They just made a surprise hit competition show on the most unlikeliest channel to even achieve high rating hits (long before NBC started to tank and dumped Coco), and they wanted to know how far they can go with their success.  Thus, they decided to bring the top two rivaled idols from the first competition, put them in a movie with no acting expertise whatsoever, rip off ""Grease"", and make money on their rising star power.  Cut, print, send ""From Justin to Kelly"".  And a lot of people hated it, and thus made little revenue as a result; plus, Justin Guarini was scarified to work for the rest of his life as a hair dresser (possibly).  As of now, I'm certain the current American Idol will snipe at anyone who even mentions the words 'Justin' and 'Kelly' in the same sentence.I'm sure the cast were having fun during filming, and I don't doubt that the crew didn't try, but this is a lousy musical with no real soul to it.  When it comes to the numbers, they just stink. ""From Justin to Kelly"" may not have the same problem as ""Grease 2"" or ""Xanadu"" where the characters just talk during musical numbers or just let the background voice do the singing while everyone dances, but the song & dance routines here are terrible. Some are just too short to be musical numbers, the numbers themselves are very coerced, and I hate how the songs are more emphasized on percussion beats. One song that bothered me the most was the one where the blonde best friend of Kelly is singing about men, which sounds like a cheap paradigm to Kate Hudson's ""Cinema Italiano"".The story won't be winning any hearts.  Kelly and her friends moved away from Texas to an exotic beach location; Justin and his buddies decided to make money from an exotic beach location.  Kelly's friends consists of onePrincess Tianaand the blondie who kept stealing or destroying Kelly's relationship because that's what friends are for; Justin's buddies consists of a tanned cockamamie schmuck who raps worse than Vanilla Ice and quite possibly the dumbest nerd in movie history.  By chance and a dance number, Kelly and Justin met in the same shoreline and it was love at commercial sight. What process from there are very conventional sub-plots.  Tanned schmuck tried to make money from outlandishly skimpy contests that are too elaborate to be plausible (from whipped-cream bikini contest to hovercraft races), only for him to be caught by a female beach cop each time, who always appears whenever he earns some cash like a stalker. The nerd waits for the girl he met online, and he gets into embarrassing situations because he's a nerd. Princess Tiana falls head-over-heels with a dishwasher (thisagain?), and the blonde backstabber tries to break Justin and Kelly apart; but of course, in the end, love conquers all and blas&eacute; blas&eacute;.Accounting the lousy acting and Justin's dead eyes as well, this is an unsuccessful affair.  There are better musicals out there to watch: ""The Sound of Music"", ""Hairspray"", and even ""High School Musical""; movies like those actually stand the test of time, unlike ""From Justin to Kelly"".  It may not reach William Hung levels of awfulness, but if American Idol considered this the black sheep of the franchise, it's best to just walk away.

I Actually Enjoyed The Movie!I'm 34 years old and fondly remember watching Grease and old Gidget movies with Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello and the gang.  And From Justin To Kelly took me back to that time.  A time when a movie didn't have to have a really solid plot line, a strong message or anything else.  A time when a movie could just be a feel-good, fun fest with lots of good music.  More importantly, a fresh film that I can share with my children.  This movie is fresh, fun and definitely feel good!Basic premise: The &quot;Mayor's Of Spring Break&quot; from Philly (Justin &amp; Brad) throw all the wild parties in Florida.  Alexa, Kya and Kelly are from Texas and hit the beach for spring break themselves.  As everyone is dancing, having a good time and surprisingly adept at the choreography ;o), Justin &amp; Kelly meet and it's Like At First Sight!  Unfortunately, Alexa is the jealous type suffering from a lack of positive identity, so she usurps Kelly at every turn to keep Justin away from her.  Fortunately, it doesn't work well because Justin and Kelly keep finding each other.  And all this while singing really nice songs and innocent dialog.

In the same mode as Glitter, Showgirls, and Crossroads, From Justin to Kelly is destined to be a cult classic.

The faults lie within the directors and writers who actually thought this film was going to be anything good. Kelly Clarkson is fiesty and charming, and her beautiful, powerful chops take center stage as she blows everyone away. Justin Guarini sounds good, but he tries a little to hard in the acting department. He is not as natural as Kelly is, and unfortunatly the 2 of have zero chemistry. Other supporting actors do their best, but I have a feeling we will never see them again in anything else.

I previously had no intention of ever watching this movie but when I read that review I felt that I just had to see the movie, just to see if it could possibly be *that* bad.  I'm not sure any movie could be quite as bad as Mr. Gleiberman thinks this one is, and to be honest, From Justin to Kelly is not that bad.  Make no mistake about it, it isn't a good movie, but by no means is it as bad as what the food court staff at Sea World could do.Here's the plot: Kelly (Kelly Clarkson) is a waitress in a bar in Texas.  She and two of her friends drive out to Miami for Spring Break.  Justin (Justin Guarini) and two of his friends are also heading out to Miami, both for some fun as well as to promote some parties and events there.  Justin and Kelly meet and are interested in each other but there is always some thing going wrong when they try to get together.The movie is a musical, so every now and again they bust in to song and dance.  None of the songs are that good, though they try hard.  The movie has the kind of parties where everyone knows all the moves to the dance, and so we have Justin and Kelly walking along the beach when the start singing and everyone on the beach starts a choreographed dance routine.  The dance routines are probably the best part of the movie, and I was a little impressed by Justin and Kelly's dancing.  It's more than I can do.  To be charitable, the movie's audience is probably not a twentysomething male, but rather the preteen crowd.  On that level, it may work.Nothing about this movie suggests that From Justin to Kelly is as bad as Mr. Gleiberman's review.  The movie is not horrible.  It is not an abomination, and it is not a crime against humanity (as I have seen some user reviewers state). From Justin to Kelly is just not a good movie.

If you don't go to see this movie at least once in Theatres you're wasting a good movie. I am 13 and instrested in this kind of production and I am glad Mom took us to see it Saturday. I mean you can actually get the urge to get up and dance to the music like the characters I mean I saw a little girl at the end of the movie dancing in her seat and people not so far down below us laughing and dancing and my sister did not dance but was tapping her foot and was at the edge of her seat looking like she wanted to stand up. I am going to beg to see this film in theatres before Septmember if I don't I will die because I missed seeing it's last appearance on the big screen.

614821,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JM9N,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 11]","I started watching ""American Idol"" where I got wind of the uproar over Tamyra Gray being voted off.  Since I teach a course on Popular Culture I usually catch the end of most of these cult reality shows so I can at least recognize these people when they pop up in commercials on the television.  I thought it was obvious that Kelly Clarkson was the only one left with a voice and one thing about ""From Justin to Kelly"" is it reaffirms that there is no reason for to second guess the final results as there was the second time around.  For all of their duets, Clarkson has to tone down her voice, otherwise there would be nothing left of her co-star but little curly hairs all over the beach.  Notice that the duet of ""Anytime"" consists of Clarkson alone on the beach for most of the song and Justin coming in for something like a cameo at the end.  He is game and he knows how to sell a song to the audience, but the voice is not as great as the desire.The main thing I got out of ""From Justin To Kelly"" was that neither embarassed themselves having to dance.  The story was written by Kim Fuller (brother of the ""other"" Simon, the other one who was a producer of ""American Idol""), which probably explains why texting messages from Justin to Kelly on their cell phones is a major part of the plot.  This is basically a spring break musical with realistic touches such as whipped cream bikinis that Frankie and Annette never had to deal with (but there is a thought right there, right America?).  Clarkson plays a waitress in a Texas bar named Kelly (she tells him that her friends call her ""Kelly for short"" and I have to tell you that one had me scratching my head for a while) who is coaxed by her two friends into going to Florida for spring break.  Guarini plays a guy name Justin who apparently runs beach entertainment for the masses with his two friends.  Her friends are the kindly thoughtful girl (Anika Noni Rose) and the selfish Queen B (Katherine Bailess), while his are the oversexed rappin' stud (Greg Siff) and the lonely computer nerd (Brian Dietzen).As for the story, it is just an excuse to work in songs and dance numbers.  Boy meets girl, girl gives boy phone number, boy immediately loses phone number, boy gets wrong girl's phone number, and then the script proceeds through the rest of the plot number by number.  Someone who is better versed in Fifties and Sixties Beach movies than I am can probably cite chapter on verse as to where everything in this film originally came from in Hollywood history.  Everybody does their own singing, which is a good thing, and everything is innocent enough (which may well be the big complaint).  However, there is more chemistry between every other couple in the film than between our two American Idols.  Nor is there any reason for us to expect otherwise; it was ""American Idol"" not ""Singing Bachelorette.""Only people who watched ""American Idol"" are going to check out ""From Justin to Kelly,"" which is probably not much more than the producers were hoping would happen.  But if you want something to keep go pick up Kelly's debut CD, and if, after listening to that, you decide that if there were two people from the first ""American Idol"" that you would like to hear singing duets on the big screen and those two would be Kelly Clarkson and Tamyra Gray, you would not be alone.",3,"Yep, the right person won the first ""American Idol""",1063324800,"09 12, 2003",2003,3341,"['started', 'watching', 'American', 'Idol', 'where', 'got', 'wind', 'uproar', 'Tamyra', 'Gray', 'being', 'voted', 'off', 'teach', 'course', 'Popular', 'Culture', 'usually', 'catch', 'end', 'most', 'cult', 'reality', 'so', 'can', 'least', 'recognize', 'people', 'when', 'pop', 'up', 'commercials', 'television', 'thought', 'was', 'obvious', 'Kelly', 'Clarkson', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'voice', 'one', 'thing', 'Justin', 'Kelly', 'reason', 'second', 'guess', 'final', 'results', 'was', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'duets', 'Clarkson', 'tone', 'down', 'voice', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'left', 'co-star', 'little', 'curly', 'hairs', 'beach', 'Notice', 'duet', 'Anytime', 'Clarkson', 'alone', 'beach', 'most', 'song', 'Justin', 'coming', 'something', 'cameo', 'end', 'game', 'how', 'sell', 'song', 'audience', 'voice', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'desire.The', 'main', 'thing', 'got', 'out', 'From', 'Justin', 'Kelly', 'was', 'embarassed', 'having', 'dance', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'Kim', 'Fuller', 'brother', 'other', 'Simon', 'other', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'producer', 'American', 'Idol', 'probably', 'why', 'texting', 'messages', 'Justin', 'Kelly', 'cell', 'phones', 'major', 'part', 'plot', 'basically', 'spring', 'break', 'musical', 'realistic', 'touches', 'such', 'whipped', 'cream', 'bikinis', 'Frankie', 'Annette', 'never', 'had', 'deal', 'thought', 'right', 'there', 'right', 'America', 'Clarkson', 'waitress', 'Texas', 'bar', 'named', 'Kelly', 'friends', 'call', 'Kelly', 'short', 'have', 'tell', 'one', 'had', 'scratching', 'head', 'while', 'who', 'coaxed', 'two', 'friends', 'going', 'Florida', 'spring', 'break', 'Guarini', 'guy', 'name', 'Justin', 'who', 'apparently', 'beach', 'entertainment', 'masses', 'two', 'friends', 'friends', 'are', 'kindly', 'thoughtful', 'girl', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'selfish', 'Queen', 'B', 'Katherine', 'Bailess', 'are', 'oversexed', 'rappin', 'stud', 'Greg', 'Siff', 'lonely', 'computer', 'nerd', 'Brian', 'Dietzen', '.As', 'story', 'just', 'excuse', 'work', 'songs', 'dance', 'numbers', 'Boy', 'girl', 'girl', 'boy', 'phone', 'number', 'boy', 'immediately', 'phone', 'number', 'boy', 'wrong', 'girl', 'phone', 'number', 'then', 'script', 'proceeds', 'rest', 'plot', 'number', 'number', 'Someone', 'who', 'better', 'versed', 'Fifties', 'Sixties', 'Beach', 'movies', 'am', 'can', 'probably', 'cite', 'chapter', 'verse', 'where', 'everything', 'film', 'originally', 'came', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'Everybody', 'own', 'singing', 'good', 'thing', 'everything', 'innocent', 'enough', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'big', 'complaint', 'However', 'more', 'chemistry', 'other', 'couple', 'film', 'two', 'American', 'Idols', 'there', 'reason', 'expect', 'otherwise', 'was', 'American', 'Idol', 'not', 'Singing', 'Bachelorette', 'Only', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'American', 'Idol', 'are', 'going', 'check', 'out', 'Justin', 'Kelly', 'probably', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'producers', 'were', 'hoping', 'would', 'happen', 'want', 'something', 'keep', 'go', 'pick', 'up', 'Kelly', 'debut', 'CD', 'listening', 'decide', 'were', 'two', 'people', 'first', 'American', 'Idol', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'singing', 'duets', 'big', 'screen', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'Kelly', 'Clarkson', 'Tamyra', 'Gray', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'alone']",N/A

If not, why would anyone even bother to watch this, in the first place, & expect something substantial!?! If a movie was going to be made with the inexperienced Kelly Clarkson & Justin Guarini (to cash in on their ""A.I."" popularity) this type of film was a perfect vehicle for their ""talents"". This genre of film is not known for great acting or substantial storylines & that's why they're the perfect leads. I think Justin & Kelly deserve a lot more credit than they have received. One minute they walked in off the street to audition for a TV show & the next minute a huge spotlight is on them. And then they are thrust onto a movie set to star in a film!! For two young virtual nobodies I think they handled themselves pretty well considering the pressure, & overwhelming excitement they must have felt. Yes, they wanted it & they GOT IT FAST!!!!!!!! The movie has it's flaws. Kelly Clarkson is no great beauty, so special attention should have been made to make her appear as pretty as possible. She looks downright homely in some scenes with little or no makeup, unflattering photography, & horrible clothes. She could have looked so much better. Justin is photographed in an unflattering fashion in some scenes too. They also have absolutely no romantic screen chemistry at all.

This is a breathtaking film filled with wonderful music dancing and acting. At first, I really wasn't all into Kelly Clarkson. I wasn't on the bandwagon. I'm now driving the dang Kelly Clarkson Family Truckster now. She's a cute little philly with musical chops. She carries this film. Justin comes off like Billy Packer in this film. He has a stupid monchichi hairdo and sings like something is lodged in his butt. I couldn't follow the plot in this movie very well because it's very complicated and I'm not what you call intelligent. I think Kelly and her little friends want to go to Florida for spring break so they can settle a debt her grandfather had with the Giambi crime family. Justin and his friends are also in florida, but I think they are there to sweep up bird poop at a city park. At some point, Kelly falls for Justin and musical bliss ensues. The songs are better than anything the Beatles or Corey Hart ever did. This film is flawless, but with anything flawless, I could find a way to improve it. Here's how I would have laid this film out:Kelly and her two hot friends(played by Natalie Portman and Keira Knightly) would be on their way to spring break in Gretna. At spring break there would be a three day music festival featuring the following bands/singers: Motorhead, Animotion, Kenny Rogers, Flaming afterbirth, USA for Africa, Corey Hart, Chicago, Boston, Dallas, Boyz II Men, Another Bad Creation, Bell Biv Devoe, Russ Abernathy and the WKNO Mafia, Sarah Thomas, Grim Reaper, Yanni and Hasselhoff for 8 hours. Justin and his friends wouldn't make it to Gretna, they would run into a tree. They wouldn't die, but they also wouldn't be in the film for more than 2 minutes.

Still, watching Simon Cowell et al. is like knee surgery to me (well, actually, I saw this US TV show once before, but I instantly hated it and turned it off.)And I never expected the producers dare to make a film out of the show.  Sure, Kelly Clarkson is a nice person, and so is Justin Guarini, I only imagine this not having seen them yet, but ... theatrical movies???  Single record or even album, I can understand, but a movie?  And with the '20th Century Fox' fanfare?  Oh Hollywood is so desperate.Anyway, the film.  The story is thin, but that's not real problem.  Three boys and three girls meet at the beach.  Period.  You can see some dancing while the stock characters delivering the dialogues.  You can hear music; you can see some gags; and you get ... what you want.  In short, Kelly Clarkson is virtually playing herself (her role as 'Kelly') down-to-earth, nice, all-American girl.The real problem is, the film is not fun; one of Kelly's friends behaves so nasty and mean that I started to disbelieve my eyes.  She steals cell phone number from Justin; she plots against Kelly and Justin with false notes and incredible lies, and Kelly is so easily deceived because she is her best friend.  Guys in the film are no different; one of them is a typical 'nerd' stock character, who is there to be laughed at with his 'Star Trek' reference and obsession for the Internet.Add to the poor story, the songs are forgetable, and dance choreography is not good either.Director Robert Iscove did a far better job in 'She's All That' with Rachel Leigh Cook, but it may be unfair to blame him for the film's awful results.

But they felt that since Kelly Clarkson is very popular now and Justin has his album coming out soon, that they could make some money off this movie. Ahem...as of today, this film has grossed just over 3 million dollars and opened at no.11 on the box-office chart. No. 11!...i.e. did not even crack the top ten. I saw this film with a fellow wannabe-critic and friend and there were (literally) scenes that were just so painfully unfunny, cliched & derivitive that we laughed aloud. We even played a little game where every scene & plot situation came, we would name how many movies it had already been in, which since every scene (and basically the entire story) derives from other movies it kept us busy. Written by genius Kim Fuller (who also wrote that modern-day masterpiece ""Spiceworld"") and directed by world-renowed auteur Robert Iscove, who also made the glorious & original cinematic experience known as ""She's all That"") combine to create movie magic. That is if magic now means complete and utter garbage. First of all, Justin's 2 friends in the movie are the cliched-to-hell jock/playa & the nerdy/uptight virgin who (but of course) by the end of the film becomes a loosey-goosey wild man. Kelly's friends are the highly original bitchy/jealous slut and the dependent, lean-on-my shoulder black friend who can always be counted on (and the film gives this friend a budding romance with a local bartender that is SO uninteresting and so lame that I screamed out loud every time the film went back to her). Now on to the musical sequences. Justin & Kelly have both said that the film is like ""Grease on the beach"". But why do we love Grease? Why do we watch it over and over again and enjoy it so much? Because it has unforgettable characters we know & love, funny situations, and wonderful dances and songs that we cannot get out of our heads. FJ2K has none of this. Not only do we not care or have any interest about the one-dimensional characters at all (thanks Ms. Fuller...keep up the good writing!) but we forget about the songs immediately as they are over and the dancing is the same as your standard, MTV R&B music video. Nothing original, nothing exciting, nothing worth seeing. It is all bland, unoffensive, boring, uninteresting, cliched, hammy (especially Justin's acting...why, he must've studied under Brando!) Oh...and how many times are we gonna hear KC & The Sunshine's Band ""That's the way I like it"" in the movies? First in ""The In Laws"" last month and now again. I am someone who has seen lots of movies, and by lots I do not mean I go to the theater once every week. I watch on average 10-12 films a week, and have seen almost everything. So I think with some knowledge & experience that ""From Justin to Kelly"" is, in the spirit of American Idol judge Simon Cowell, quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen.",1,Hilariously unfunny and cliched....,1056326400,"06 23, 2003",2003,3033,"['movie', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'film', 'critics', 'ahead', 'time', 'theatrically', 'released', 'films', 'review', 'obviously', 'knew', 'had', 'complete', 'bomb', 'hands', 'felt', 'Kelly', 'Clarkson', 'very', 'popular', 'now', 'Justin', 'album', 'coming', 'out', 'soon', 'could', 'make', 'money', 'movie', 'Ahem', 'today', 'film', 'grossed', 'just', '3', 'million', 'dollars', 'opened', 'no.11', 'box-office', 'chart', 'No', '11', 'i.e', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'crack', 'top', 'ten', 'saw', 'film', 'fellow', 'wannabe-critic', 'friend', 'were', 'literally', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'painfully', 'unfunny', 'cliched', 'derivitive', 'laughed', 'aloud', 'even', 'played', 'little', 'game', 'where', 'scene', 'plot', 'situation', 'came', 'would', 'name', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'scene', 'basically', 'entire', 'story', 'other', 'movies', 'kept', 'busy', 'Written', 'genius', 'Kim', 'Fuller', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'modern-day', 'masterpiece', 'Spiceworld', 'directed', 'world-renowed', 'auteur', 'Robert', 'Iscove', 'who', 'also', 'made', 'glorious', 'original', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'known', 'That', 'combine', 'create', 'movie', 'magic', 'magic', 'now', 'complete', 'utter', 'garbage', 'First', 'Justin', '2', 'friends', 'movie', 'are', 'cliched-to-hell', 'jock/playa', 'nerdy/uptight', 'virgin', 'who', 'course', 'end', 'film', 'loosey-goosey', 'wild', 'man', 'Kelly', 'friends', 'are', 'highly', 'original', 'bitchy/jealous', 'slut', 'dependent', 'lean-on-my', 'shoulder', 'black', 'friend', 'who', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'counted', 'film', 'friend', 'budding', 'romance', 'local', 'bartender', 'SO', 'uninteresting', 'so', 'lame', 'screamed', 'out', 'loud', 'time', 'film', 'went', 'back', 'Now', 'musical', 'sequences', 'Justin', 'Kelly', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'Grease', 'beach', 'why', 'do', 'love', 'Grease', 'Why', 'do', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'know', 'love', 'funny', 'situations', 'wonderful', 'dances', 'songs', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'heads', 'FJ2K', 'none', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'have', 'interest', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'thanks', 'Ms.', 'Fuller', 'keep', 'good', 'writing', 'forget', 'songs', 'immediately', 'are', 'dancing', 'same', 'standard', 'MTV', 'R', 'B', 'music', 'video', 'Nothing', 'original', 'nothing', 'exciting', 'nothing', 'worth', 'seeing', 'bland', 'unoffensive', 'boring', 'uninteresting', 'cliched', 'hammy', 'especially', 'Justin', 'acting', 'why', 'must', ""'ve"", 'studied', 'Brando', 'Oh', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'gon', 'hear', 'KC', 'Sunshine', 'Band', 'way', 'like', 'movies', 'First', 'Laws', 'last', 'month', 'now', 'again', 'am', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'lots', 'movies', 'lots', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'go', 'theater', 'once', 'week', 'watch', 'average', '10-12', 'films', 'week', 'have', 'seen', 'almost', 'everything', 'think', 'knowledge', 'experience', 'Justin', 'Kelly', 'spirit', 'American', 'Idol', 'judge', 'Simon', 'Cowell', 'quite', 'possibly', 'worst', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

Actually 2003's ""From Justin to KellY"" is a fun musical/beach film in the manner of Elvis films and the 60's beach flicks. One look at the dvd and it's obvious.When viewing films of this ilk it's time to just kick back, turn your brain off and have a good time. On this level ""From Justin to Kelly"" works fabulously. It's pretty much just as good or better than any Elvis or beach movie you can think of. Filmed in the Miami/Ft. Lauderdale area, the story deals with the romantic adventures of youths on Spring Break. Keeping with the traditions of the genre there's no raunch or moronic sex/bathroom humor; the film has an appealing innocence.Another highlight is that there are more gorgeous bikini-clad babes per minute than practically any movie out there (dudes too, if you're a woman).To be expected, the songs featured are all substance-less modern pop ditties. This type of music isn't my cup of tea but it fits the upbeat and fun vibe of the film.I'm hardly an American Idol aficionado but I admit that I do enjoy the show if I see it (my wife watches it); and Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini, the two stars of the film, are two of the more likable ""idols"" over the years. (I also confess to liking Katharine McPhee, Bo Bice, Carrie Underwood, Chris Daughtry, Kelly Pickler and Clay Aiken). (I'm just joking about Aiken -- ha, ha!) To be expected, Kelly and Justin aren't the best actors but they're not bad either; it certainly doesn't prevent you from enjoying the film. They did a fine job all things considered.One can't bring up American Idol without mentioning the ever-present Kimberly Caldwell (from the channel station). She's an undeniably good-looking woman but she tends to grate on the nerves. The reason I bring her up is, if you've ever secretly fantasized about seeing her chopped in half, be sure to check out the goofy gorefest ""Wrong Turn 2: Dead End"" (2007) (I'd call it a horror film but it's way too silly and over-the-top to be horrifying). This film makes your fantasies come true -- literally!Side A of the dvd features the 81-minute fullscreen version of the film whereas Side B has the 90-minute extended widescreen cut, which has a couple of extra dance numbers. The dvd also features a commentary with the two stars & director, as well as 3 deleted scenes.If you're in the mood for an innocent beach flick turn your brain off and enjoy!",4,Fun musical/beach flick,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,2506,"['ultra-low', 'reviews', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'What', 'were', 'people', 'expecting', 'serious', 'drama', 'superb', 'acting', 'action', 'film', 'Actually', '2003', 'Justin', 'KellY', 'fun', 'musical/beach', 'film', 'manner', 'Elvis', 'films', '60', 'beach', 'flicks', 'One', 'look', 'dvd', 'obvious.When', 'viewing', 'films', 'ilk', 'time', 'just', 'kick', 'back', 'turn', 'brain', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'level', 'Justin', 'Kelly', 'fabulously', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'Elvis', 'beach', 'movie', 'can', 'think', 'Filmed', 'Miami/Ft', 'Lauderdale', 'area', 'story', 'deals', 'romantic', 'adventures', 'youths', 'Spring', 'Break', 'Keeping', 'traditions', 'genre', 'raunch', 'moronic', 'sex/bathroom', 'humor', 'film', 'appealing', 'innocence.Another', 'highlight', 'are', 'more', 'gorgeous', 'bikini-clad', 'babes', 'minute', 'practically', 'movie', 'there', 'dudes', 'too', ""'re"", 'woman', '.To', 'be', 'expected', 'songs', 'featured', 'are', 'substance-less', 'modern', 'pop', 'ditties', 'type', 'music', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea', 'upbeat', 'fun', 'vibe', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'hardly', 'American', 'Idol', 'aficionado', 'admit', 'do', 'enjoy', 'show', 'see', 'wife', 'watches', 'Kelly', 'Clarkson', 'Justin', 'Guarini', 'two', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'likable', 'idols', 'years', 'also', 'confess', 'liking', 'Katharine', 'McPhee', 'Bo', 'Bice', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'Chris', 'Daughtry', 'Kelly', 'Pickler', 'Clay', 'Aiken', ""'m"", 'just', 'joking', 'about', 'Aiken', 'ha', 'ha', 'be', 'expected', 'Kelly', 'Justin', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', 'actors', ""'re"", 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'enjoying', 'film', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'things', 'considered.One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'up', 'American', 'Idol', 'mentioning', 'ever-present', 'Kimberly', 'Caldwell', 'channel', 'station', 'undeniably', 'good-looking', 'woman', 'grate', 'nerves', 'reason', 'bring', 'up', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'secretly', 'fantasized', 'seeing', 'chopped', 'half', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'goofy', 'gorefest', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '2', 'Dead', 'End', '2007', ""'d"", 'call', 'horror', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'silly', 'over-the-top', 'be', 'horrifying', 'film', 'fantasies', 'come', 'true', 'literally', 'Side', 'A', 'dvd', '81-minute', 'fullscreen', 'version', 'film', 'whereas', 'Side', 'B', '90-minute', 'extended', 'widescreen', 'cut', 'couple', 'extra', 'dance', 'numbers', 'dvd', 'also', 'commentary', 'two', 'stars', 'director', 'as', 'well', '3', 'deleted', 'scenes.If', ""'re"", 'mood', 'innocent', 'beach', 'flick', 'turn', 'brain', 'enjoy']",N/A

It's a stupid idea, with stupid people in it which makes it a stupid movie. I'm sure all the immature premadonnas will love seeing this movie, along with the American Idol FREAKS out there, but us normal people will be just fine with sane movies, movies that will actually make more than was spent on them...hence the title ""Looks like another Water World."" It was preordained that this movie would be a bust...even the previews aren't interesting, not even the least bit eye-catching, besides the half-clothed women dancing on the beach. Other than that, it's just stupid. This is definately not a movie I want to spend my money on, and I hope everyone else out there will DO THE RIGHT THING and refrain from seeing it. Grease is dead people...let's not try to make a 21st century remake with people who are fake stars to begin with!This American Idol thing is getting out of hand. Just because you can sing doesn't mean you can act. Tamyra Gray is a great singer, but she can't act her way out of a paperbag. Neither can Justin/Kelly.
