So, let's talk about this. The summary given talked about this anime was sorta a mecha show where the main character was recruited by a crossdresser.  I guess I came thinking it would be something like Jun Watarase. It was sorta a selling point of something, as I really don't get mecha anime for its own sake. I'm into shoujo, especially magical girl anime (here's a good example of the type of mechan anime I'd buy, Magic Knight Rayearth).So, instead, we get extremely bad drag which only happens once in the anime (thank the gods), boring unlikeable mecha sequences (they were routinely out of gas/low on weaponry for about the first few episodes, and the expert pilot was even more inept at working the controls than our rank amateur heroine), and even more boring and unlikeable conversation (the male lead has some ""cute"" nickname, at least in the English dub, for the female lead, which I suppose was supposed to be funny but just felt crass and lame). Oh yea, and the other character on the DVD set I think became evil, but it was revealed right away so there was no suspense.  The way she said Jinki was great too, I'm sure there's some sort of Japanese pronunciation, or perhaps they could have used a different word.  Instead they said Jinki like the characters from Scooby Do whenever anything goes wrong or whatever.
