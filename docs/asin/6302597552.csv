322362,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,6302597552,andy8047,"[5, 5]","This episode of Fox's Married..With Children is a true Christmas classic. It first aired on December 24,1989(not the 17th as stated on tv.com). Steve Rhoades(David Garrison) spends the holidays with his widowed mother. She came to get him via taxicab from her Cincinatti home! So his wife Marcy(Amanda Bearse) spends Christmas alone. Marcy is ""getting down"" at the Christmas Eve party at the bank where she works as a drive-thru window teller,her demotion from accountant. After patriarch Al Bundy(Ed O'Neill) receives a shock from a faulty live wire from his Christmas light set,he falls asleep and dreams what life would be like if he were dead. In the dream sequence,a guardian angel(the late great Sam Kinison) shows Al what is happening in his wife Peg's(Katey Sagal)(fictitious)second marriage. Peg married a sophisticated man named Norman Jablonski(guest star and future MWC cast member Ted McGinley). Daughter Kelly(Christina Applegate) and son Bud(David Faustino) are college students. Take note of how all four are dressed in 1950's fashions. ""I want my family back!"",exclaims a desperate Al. Also,at the shoe store where Al works and manages as well,he entertains an army of young children,only for them to be met with disappointment. Their parents pay for them to be babysat and are later refunded. This episode is from Married...With Children-The Complete Fourth Season in two parts. This episode had a special closing montage. Instead of Al and Peg sitting on their living room sofa,we see a night scene of the Bundy house with a snow-covered ground and we hear IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE CHRISTMAS performed by an unknown ensemble. McGinley, of Happy Days fame,joined MWC in late 1990,playing Jefferson D'Arcy,who would become Marcy's second husband(her marriage to Steve ended in sudden divorce). Another episode similar to this is YOU BETTER WATCH OUT from 1987. In that episode,Santa Claus is found dead in the Bundys' backyard.",5,It's A Bundyful Christmas!,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,1953,"['episode', 'Fox', 'Married..With', 'Children', 'true', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'first', 'aired', 'December', '24,1989', 'not', '17th', 'stated', 'tv.com', 'Steve', 'Rhoades', 'David', 'Garrison', 'holidays', 'widowed', 'mother', 'came', 'get', 'taxicab', 'Cincinatti', 'home', 'wife', 'Marcy', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'Christmas', 'alone', 'Marcy', 'getting', 'down', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'party', 'bank', 'where', 'drive-thru', 'window', 'teller', 'demotion', 'accountant', 'patriarch', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'shock', 'faulty', 'live', 'wire', 'Christmas', 'light', 'set', 'asleep', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'were', 'dead', 'dream', 'sequence', 'guardian', 'angel', 'late', 'great', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'Al', 'what', 'happening', 'wife', 'Peg', 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'fictitious', 'second', 'marriage', 'Peg', 'married', 'sophisticated', 'man', 'named', 'Norman', 'Jablonski', 'guest', 'star', 'future', 'MWC', 'cast', 'member', 'Ted', 'McGinley', 'Daughter', 'Kelly', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'son', 'Bud', 'David', 'Faustino', 'are', 'college', 'students', 'Take', 'note', 'how', 'four', 'are', 'dressed', '1950', 'fashions', 'want', 'family', 'back', 'desperate', 'Al', 'Also', 'shoe', 'store', 'where', 'Al', 'as', 'well', 'army', 'young', 'children', 'only', 'be', 'met', 'disappointment', 'parents', 'pay', 'be', 'babysat', 'are', 'later', 'refunded', 'episode', 'Married', 'Children-The', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'two', 'parts', 'episode', 'had', 'special', 'closing', 'montage', 'Instead', 'Al', 'Peg', 'sitting', 'living', 'room', 'sofa', 'see', 'night', 'scene', 'Bundy', 'house', 'snow-covered', 'ground', 'hear', 'IT', 'BEGINNING', 'TO', 'LOOK', 'A', 'LOT', 'LIKE', 'CHRISTMAS', 'performed', 'unknown', 'ensemble', 'McGinley', 'Happy', 'Days', 'fame', 'joined', 'MWC', 'late', '1990', 'playing', 'Jefferson', ""D'Arcy"", 'who', 'would', 'become', 'Marcy', 'second', 'husband', 'marriage', 'Steve', 'ended', 'sudden', 'divorce', 'episode', 'similar', 'YOU', 'BETTER', 'WATCH', 'OUT', '1987', 'episode', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'found', 'dead', 'Bundys', 'backyard']",Married With Children: It's a Bundyful Life VHS

With anger, angst and humor, The Angel ( Sam Kinison ) arrives, not without his own issues and proceeds to give Al a look of how life might have been.

Guest starring Sam Kinison, it features biting, non-PC humor that leaves one in stitches. From Al's unique recitation of &quot;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;, to his guardian angel's recollections of his ex-wife, this episode features some of the best Bundy humor.My only hope is that the rest of the episodes will eventually make it onto DVD - there isn't a single pre-season 8 episode of Married With Children that I wouldn't gladly buy.
