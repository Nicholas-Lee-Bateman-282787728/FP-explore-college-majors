1387952,AAVK7KV7E08ZD,B0046ZE3OE,"Don from SF ""coach41""","[6, 7]","My mom is over 70 and relatively healthy.  As with many seniors though, the doctors always recommend she get in some daily exercise.  I noticed that my mom has been lagging a little bit.  She goes out of the house once a week to do some things but other days, she sometimes doesn't leave the house.  To combat this, I told my mom to exercise in the house.  We are fortunate to have a relative large garage that she can walk around a bit.  Additionally, a neighbor will occasionally call my mom to go out and walk.  To add to the routine, I looked for some basic exercises my mom might want to do.  I tried one of the ""Walk Away The Pounds"" DVD but my mom didn't like it.She did say she wanted to learn Tai Chi, so when I saw this Scott Cole DVD, I purchased it right away.  I opened it tonight and had my mom go through the DVD as I observed.  The exercises were relatively easy and my mom didn't have a lot of trouble following along.Overall, I think we have a winner here.  My mom is not exactly the best at learning new things.  THe fact that she could follow the DVD meant it was simple enough for her to use.  I see this as something my mom can do once or twice a week in addition to anything else she does.",4,Nice DVD For Seniors,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,1212,"['mom', '70', 'relatively', 'healthy', 'many', 'seniors', 'doctors', 'always', 'recommend', 'get', 'daily', 'exercise', 'noticed', 'mom', 'been', 'lagging', 'little', 'bit', 'house', 'once', 'week', 'do', 'things', 'other', 'days', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'leave', 'house', 'combat', 'told', 'mom', 'exercise', 'house', 'are', 'fortunate', 'have', 'relative', 'large', 'garage', 'can', 'walk', 'bit', 'Additionally', 'neighbor', 'will', 'occasionally', 'call', 'mom', 'go', 'out', 'walk', 'add', 'routine', 'looked', 'basic', 'exercises', 'mom', 'might', 'want', 'do', 'tried', 'one', 'Walk', 'Away', 'Pounds', 'DVD', 'mom', 'did', ""n't"", 'it.She', 'did', 'say', 'wanted', 'learn', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'when', 'saw', 'Scott', 'Cole', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'right', 'away', 'opened', 'tonight', 'had', 'mom', 'go', 'DVD', 'observed', 'exercises', 'were', 'relatively', 'easy', 'mom', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'trouble', 'following', 'along.Overall', 'think', 'have', 'winner', 'here', 'mom', 'not', 'exactly', 'best', 'learning', 'new', 'things', 'THe', 'fact', 'could', 'follow', 'DVD', 'meant', 'was', 'simple', 'enough', 'use', 'see', 'something', 'mom', 'can', 'do', 'once', 'twice', 'week', 'addition', 'anything', 'else']",Discover Tai Chi For Balance and Mobility Scott Cole Wellness Series

I previously purchased a chair exercise Pilates program, but found it extremely disappointing.This exercise DVD allowed me to gently move my muscles paying attention to my balance.  I did almost fall once, but that was due to the position I had my head in, not due to fatigue,  I appreciate that many of the chair exercises are currently mu physical therapy exercises.  And although I know that my form and breathing were not good this first time I found myself thinking - wow, I can't wait to do this again!  The instructor was slow, steady and encouraging and referred to the student quite often (who was doing just as well as he was btw).  This also helped me and served as encouragement - I can't wait to move like they do.  I hope that with continued use of the program, I will be able to!
