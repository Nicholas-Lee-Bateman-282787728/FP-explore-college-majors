But for the most part you will want to repeat watching.It helps that I have already dabbled in a lot of the arts so I can tell that whoever chose the individual artists excelled in the choice.The presentation is in episodes like Memory, Landscape, and Community. I am not sure of the significance. I just watched from one end of the DVD to the next. Two good points about this presentation. One it is not in sound bite form where all the artists say one thing then all the artists says anointer. Second it tells a little history of how the artist came to a point in life where he/she decides to be an artist instead of a drone in society.I know that the series cannot be everything for everybody, however I would have liked them to have slow down to shoe more of the mechanical details of each craft.",5,Good eclectic collection of artists.,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,971,"['time', 'artist', 'excels', 'mechanics', 'expression', 'make', 'want', 'try', 'different', 'arts', 'yourself.Every', 'once', 'while', 'clinker', 'most', 'part', 'will', 'want', 'repeat', 'watching.It', 'have', 'already', 'dabbled', 'lot', 'arts', 'can', 'tell', 'chose', 'individual', 'artists', 'excelled', 'choice.The', 'presentation', 'episodes', 'Memory', 'Landscape', 'Community', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'significance', 'just', 'watched', 'one', 'end', 'DVD', 'next', 'Two', 'good', 'points', 'presentation', 'One', 'not', 'sound', 'bite', 'form', 'where', 'artists', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'then', 'artists', 'anointer', 'Second', 'little', 'history', 'how', 'artist', 'came', 'point', 'life', 'where', 'he/she', 'be', 'artist', 'instead', 'drone', 'society.I', 'know', 'series', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'everything', 'everybody', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'slow', 'down', 'shoe', 'more', 'mechanical', 'details', 'craft']","Craft in America, Season 1"

But the consistent high quality of the interviews and the visuals, and the enormous diversity of the featured artists, makes it a stand-out in the art documentary genre.  It emphasizes each artist's sense of place, as well as illustrating the way creative traditions are fused with culture and passed down over generations.
