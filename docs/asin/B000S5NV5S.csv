It helps kids recognize their letters, sound out words, and spell, which I appreciate. However, learning aside- this show is fantastic. It is HILARIOUS, the characters are well-developed and lovable, and the quality is fantastic.I know this show is meant for preschoolers, but my 7 year old loves it too. She is a beginning reader, and she feels very cool being able to recognize all the words in WordWorld.

It takes the letters and forms the words so children can see and hear how the word is spelled and sounds.
