I've only been following the Buddhist lifestyle for a few years and I found this film to be very helpful.  Sometimes the books can be a little dry and some of the names and places are very difficult to pronounce, that's another reason why this is a really great film.  So much information is given in the 90 minute video but if you want a Buddhism 101, I highly recommend it.  Even if you're not a Buddhist, it's a beautiful story.",5,Complete and Concise,1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,528,"[""'re"", 'new', 'Buddhism', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'more', 'probably', 'best', 'place', 'start', ""'ve"", 'only', 'been', 'following', 'Buddhist', 'lifestyle', 'few', 'years', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'helpful', 'Sometimes', 'books', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'dry', 'names', 'places', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'pronounce', 'reason', 'why', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'So', 'much', 'information', 'given', '90', 'minute', 'video', 'want', 'Buddhism', '101', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'Buddhist', 'beautiful', 'story']",Life of Buddha

809720,ADOZJJSJ9R5XI,B0001LJCI4,Kim Boykin,"[11, 11]","This 90-minute documentary (with audio in English, French, or German) tells the traditional story of the life of the Buddha and intersperses information about the way of life in northern India at the time of the Buddha.If you're new to Buddhism, you may find the film a little slow, with more detail than you really want. I think it will be more interesting to those who already know something about Buddhism. I learned details of the story of the Buddha that were new to me, and I enjoyed getting a better sense of how the Buddha might actually have lived. For many years, in teaching classes on Buddhism, I've shown pictures from the children's book ""Prince Siddhartha"" to illustrate the story of the Buddha, but now I show excerpts from this video instead or in addition.The DVD's bonus features (50 minutes' worth) seem to be footage that didn't make it into the actual film. I found much of it pretty dull, but the extra interview material from Zen teacher Thich Nhat Hanh was a nice bonus. I especially liked his discussions of the Buddha, karma, and nirvana, and I use those in my teaching.",4,A documentary about the life of the Buddha,1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,1097,"['90-minute', 'documentary', 'audio', 'English', 'French', 'German', 'traditional', 'story', 'life', 'Buddha', 'information', 'way', 'life', 'northern', 'India', 'time', 'Buddha.If', ""'re"", 'new', 'Buddhism', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'little', 'slow', 'more', 'detail', 'really', 'want', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'something', 'Buddhism', 'learned', 'details', 'story', 'Buddha', 'were', 'new', 'enjoyed', 'getting', 'better', 'sense', 'how', 'Buddha', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'lived', 'many', 'years', 'teaching', 'classes', 'Buddhism', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'pictures', 'children', 'book', 'Prince', 'Siddhartha', 'illustrate', 'story', 'Buddha', 'now', 'show', 'excerpts', 'video', 'instead', 'addition.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', '50', 'minutes', 'worth', 'seem', 'be', 'footage', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'actual', 'film', 'found', 'much', 'dull', 'extra', 'interview', 'material', 'Zen', 'teacher', 'Thich', 'Nhat', 'Hanh', 'was', 'nice', 'bonus', 'especially', 'liked', 'discussions', 'Buddha', 'karma', 'nirvana', 'use', 'teaching']",Life of Buddha

809722,A1OHK1H7X7CTYR,B0001LJCI4,"Mr. Aditya B. Surti ""Bookoholic""","[57, 60]","Any reliable biographical account has an obligation to relate the relevant and significant facts of the `LIFE' studied without such facts being manipulated. It is not only necessary to precisely articulate the facts as they were in the life of such a person but also to meticulously place them in light of the circumstances that prevailed then. This very well researched documentary does a good job at complying with both these factors. Unlike today, at the time the Buddha lived, there wasn't a practice to document the lives of celebrities. So most of what we know about Buddha today is through widely prevalent Buddhist folklore in the regions where Buddhism is ubiquitous, the biographical accounts of Buddha as they appear in some of the oldest Buddhist manuscripts, and some intensely studied archeological remains like the stupas and the remains of the city of Nalanda which justify the authenticity of such ages-old Buddha stories. Based on these resources, this documentary carefully takes you on an educational journey depicting the life of `The Enlightened One' while avoiding exaggerations of any kind.",5,Excavating the Enlightened,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,1114,"['reliable', 'biographical', 'account', 'obligation', 'relate', 'relevant', 'significant', 'facts', 'LIFE', 'studied', 'such', 'facts', 'being', 'manipulated', 'not', 'only', 'necessary', 'precisely', 'articulate', 'facts', 'were', 'life', 'such', 'person', 'also', 'meticulously', 'place', 'light', 'circumstances', 'prevailed', 'then', 'very', 'well', 'researched', 'documentary', 'good', 'job', 'complying', 'factors', 'today', 'time', 'Buddha', 'lived', 'was', ""n't"", 'practice', 'document', 'lives', 'celebrities', 'So', 'most', 'what', 'know', 'Buddha', 'today', 'widely', 'prevalent', 'Buddhist', 'folklore', 'regions', 'where', 'Buddhism', 'ubiquitous', 'biographical', 'accounts', 'Buddha', 'appear', 'oldest', 'Buddhist', 'manuscripts', 'intensely', 'studied', 'archeological', 'remains', 'stupas', 'remains', 'city', 'Nalanda', 'justify', 'authenticity', 'such', 'ages-old', 'Buddha', 'stories', 'Based', 'resources', 'documentary', 'carefully', 'educational', 'journey', 'depicting', 'life', 'Enlightened', 'One', 'avoiding', 'exaggerations', 'kind']",Life of Buddha
