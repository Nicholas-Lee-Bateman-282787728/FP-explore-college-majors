Some genius would put on a &#34;Please don't throw popcorn boxes at the screen advertisement&#34;  at the start of each show.

1520263,A15R2LGYEX3UY8,B006VJFULS,Work In Progress,"[3, 3]","I was really glad to see this available on Amazon Instant Video.  This is a film I remembered very fondly after having seen it only once on late night TV in the 70's.  While at the level of B-movie production values, everything is done well.  The acting is solid if little bit formulaic, while the special effects were at least the quality of the original Star Trek (one of the main characters played Dr. Boyce in the first Star Trek pilot which was made into the 2-part episode ""The Cage"").  The plot involves a group of scientists in 1964 who accidentally open a time portal 107 years into the future, and who become trapped with the remnants of humanity who are trying to escape the Earth for the stars.  There are some of the favorite science fiction tropes from the 50's and 60's, i.e. hostile mutants, and (friendly) androids.  The costumes are suitably skimpy for the women and strangely lounge lizard type plunging necklines for the men.  Some good tongue in cheek humor lightens the mood for what would otherwise be a very grim topic (post nuclear holocaust survival).  There is a temporal paradox and the last scenes in the film are an accelerating time loop which I remembered vividly from my first viewing, and is still impressive today.  Note the presence of ""superfan"" Forrest J. Ackerman (the square gasket guy...you'll know what I mean when you see it).  Ackerman was possibly the greatest science fiction fan of all time, and appeared in numerous bit parts in film.
