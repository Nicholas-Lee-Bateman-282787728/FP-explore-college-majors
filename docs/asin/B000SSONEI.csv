1087507,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000SSONEI,Byron Kolln,"[7, 7]","This DVD spotlights two of the best game shows from TV's golden age.  Fancy gimmicks or serious subjects weren't needed to create a successful, well-remembered TV series in those days, and the two shows sampled with this disc prove that.BEAT THE CLOCK proves the old adage that you don't need a million dollars to make an entertaining 30 minutes of television.  Host Bud Collyer assists real-life couples through various wacky stunts.  If they complete them before their time-limit is over, the curtains part to reveal shiny new prizes.  Sponsored by Sylvania Electricals (and later on in it's run Hazel Bishop Cosmetics), BEAT THE CLOCK is still surprisingly entertaining all these years later.  Contestants are asked to do things like balancing plates on the legs of an upturned chair, re-arranging the words of a famous phrase, and catching ping-pong balls hurled through air-rifles.I'VE GOT A SECRET was a trifle more ""glamorous"", but just as uproarious when it wanted to be.  Real-life guests are paraded before a celebrity panel (comprising Jayne Meadows, Faye Emerson, Bill Cullen and Henry Morgan), who must, in a limited space of time, guess the secret they've told to host Garry Moore.  The two episodes of I'VE GOT A SECRET featured here include the famous show where Lucille Ball replaced the vacationing Ms Emerson (Desi Arnaz is the final celebrity guest; the two were in the middle of a publicity junket for ""Forever Darling""); plus the ""Easter Parade"" show where Meadows and Emerson were given bonnets with live bees concealed in them.  Host Garry Moore merrily puffs away on Winston Cigarettes, whilst the celebrity panelists throw off witty quips.  Ms Meadows is oh so elegant in her tiaras and furs.  These prints also include rare promos for Phil Silvers as Sgt. Bilko in ""You'll Never Get Rich"".I only wish there was more!  This is a great deal for the price.",4,a blast from TV's golden past,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,1880,"['DVD', 'spotlights', 'two', 'best', 'game', 'TV', 'golden', 'age', 'Fancy', 'gimmicks', 'serious', 'subjects', 'were', ""n't"", 'needed', 'create', 'successful', 'well-remembered', 'TV', 'series', 'days', 'two', 'shows', 'sampled', 'disc', 'prove', 'THE', 'CLOCK', 'old', 'adage', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'million', 'dollars', 'make', 'entertaining', '30', 'minutes', 'television', 'Host', 'Bud', 'Collyer', 'real-life', 'couples', 'various', 'wacky', 'stunts', 'complete', 'time-limit', 'curtains', 'part', 'reveal', 'shiny', 'new', 'prizes', 'Sponsored', 'Sylvania', 'Electricals', 'later', 'run', 'Hazel', 'Bishop', 'Cosmetics', 'BEAT', 'THE', 'CLOCK', 'still', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'years', 'later', 'Contestants', 'are', 'asked', 'do', 'things', 'balancing', 'plates', 'legs', 'upturned', 'chair', 're-arranging', 'words', 'famous', 'phrase', 'catching', 'ping-pong', 'balls', 'hurled', 'air-rifles.I', ""'VE"", 'GOT', 'A', 'SECRET', 'was', 'trifle', 'more', 'glamorous', 'just', 'as', 'uproarious', 'when', 'wanted', 'be', 'Real-life', 'guests', 'are', 'paraded', 'celebrity', 'panel', 'comprising', 'Jayne', 'Meadows', 'Faye', 'Emerson', 'Bill', 'Cullen', 'Henry', 'Morgan', 'who', 'must', 'limited', 'space', 'time', 'guess', 'secret', ""'ve"", 'told', 'host', 'Garry', 'Moore', 'two', 'episodes', ""'VE"", 'GOT', 'A', 'SECRET', 'featured', 'here', 'include', 'famous', 'show', 'where', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'replaced', 'vacationing', 'Ms', 'Emerson', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'final', 'celebrity', 'guest', 'two', 'were', 'middle', 'publicity', 'junket', 'Forever', 'Darling', 'Easter', 'Parade', 'show', 'where', 'Meadows', 'Emerson', 'were', 'given', 'bonnets', 'live', 'bees', 'concealed', 'Host', 'Garry', 'Moore', 'merrily', 'away', 'Winston', 'Cigarettes', 'whilst', 'celebrity', 'throw', 'off', 'witty', 'quips', 'Ms', 'Meadows', 'oh', 'so', 'elegant', 'tiaras', 'furs', 'prints', 'also', 'include', 'rare', 'promos', 'Phil', 'Silvers', 'Sgt', 'Bilko', ""'ll"", 'Never', 'Get', 'Rich', 'only', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'great', 'deal', 'price']",N/A

One of the ""I've Got a Secret"" episodes features Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, both of which seem to be enjoying themselves. ""I've Got a Secret"" was sponsored by Winston Cigarettes, and the original commercials are intact.The original commercials are also intact for ""Beat the Clock"", which despite constant plugging for the sponsors (Both of which are forgotten companies), Is also very enjoyable. The picture quality isn't perfect, But it must be remembered that these old game shows were ""Kinescoped"", which means they were recorded by pointing a motion picture camera at a TV screen. Considering that, I think the picture quality is quite acceptable. I recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys 50's TV.",5,"Good, Clean fun",1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,895,"[""'m"", 'too', 'young', 'seen', '2', 'shows', 'original', 'run', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'DVD', '2', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Secret', '2', 'episodes', 'Beat', 'Clock', 'One', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Secret', 'features', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'seem', 'be', 'enjoying', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Secret', 'was', 'sponsored', 'Winston', 'Cigarettes', 'original', 'commercials', 'are', 'intact.The', 'original', 'commercials', 'are', 'also', 'intact', 'Beat', 'Clock', 'constant', 'plugging', 'sponsors', 'are', 'forgotten', 'companies', 'also', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'picture', 'quality', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'must', 'be', 'remembered', 'old', 'game', 'shows', 'were', 'Kinescoped', 'were', 'recorded', 'pointing', 'motion', 'picture', 'camera', 'TV', 'screen', 'Considering', 'think', 'picture', 'quality', 'quite', 'acceptable', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', '50', 'TV']",N/A
