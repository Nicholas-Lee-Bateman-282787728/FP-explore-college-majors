In this season we find K.I.T.T. receiving enhancements.  For instance, in one episode K.I.T.T. and Michael have a mission that taks place at the ocean.  Coincidentally this is the same episode that April gives K.I.T.T. an enhancement that will allow him to drive on water.  Of course that enhancement is never tested and is finally used while on a mission.Next we have an episode in which K.I.T.T. is engulfed in flames.  I guess I forgot to mention that this was the episode in which April equipped K.I.T.T. with a new heat resistance coating.  Again this coating was never tested before Michael and K.I.T.T. needed the enhancement while on a mission.Finally we have the parachute.  K.I.T.T. was equipped with the parachute enhancement but it was never tested.  You guessed it, Michael & K.I.T.T. tested it on a mission.I often wonder what might have happened if K.I.T.T. was equipped with the parachute but was on the mission when he became engulfed in flame?  Or, if K.I.T.T. received the ride on water enhancement during the episode he drove off the cliff.  Of course K.I.T.T. received the right enhancement for the right episode.  Also, all these untested enhancements worked flawlessly.  I wonder what would happen if Michael & K.I.T.T. drove off a cliff, hit the parachute button only to find the system malfunctioned?  TV science is a thing to behold!I am one of the few people that didn't mind April.  I also like Bonnie and am glad she came back in season three.  However, April was treated really poorly.  She was never properly introduced, out of the blue she just shows up as the mechanic and engineer for Knight Industries.  She seems to disappear just as easily.  Here today, forgotten by tomorrow.Still, Knight Rider season two is a good buy.  The shows really are good and provide a nice break from routine and trials of everyday life.  Also, the packaging for the DVD's has improved from season one.  Now the disks come in slim clam shell cases instead of the wretched fold out booklet that season one came in.",4,If K.I.T.T. can't do it no one can.,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,2172,"['may', 'come', 'off', 'silly', 'show', 'centered', 'car', 'A.I.', 'season', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'was', 'awesome', 'chezziness', 'season', 'find', 'K.I.T.T', 'receiving', 'enhancements', 'instance', 'one', 'episode', 'K.I.T.T', 'Michael', 'have', 'mission', 'place', 'ocean', 'Coincidentally', 'same', 'episode', 'April', 'K.I.T.T', 'enhancement', 'will', 'allow', 'drive', 'water', 'course', 'enhancement', 'never', 'tested', 'finally', 'used', 'while', 'mission.Next', 'have', 'episode', 'K.I.T.T', 'engulfed', 'flames', 'guess', 'forgot', 'mention', 'was', 'episode', 'April', 'equipped', 'K.I.T.T', 'new', 'heat', 'resistance', 'coating', 'Again', 'coating', 'was', 'never', 'tested', 'Michael', 'K.I.T.T', 'needed', 'enhancement', 'mission.Finally', 'have', 'parachute', 'K.I.T.T', 'was', 'equipped', 'parachute', 'enhancement', 'was', 'never', 'tested', 'guessed', 'Michael', 'K.I.T.T', 'tested', 'mission.I', 'often', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'K.I.T.T', 'was', 'equipped', 'parachute', 'was', 'mission', 'when', 'became', 'engulfed', 'flame', 'K.I.T.T', 'received', 'ride', 'water', 'enhancement', 'episode', 'drove', 'off', 'cliff', 'course', 'K.I.T.T', 'received', 'right', 'enhancement', 'right', 'episode', 'Also', 'untested', 'enhancements', 'worked', 'flawlessly', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Michael', 'K.I.T.T', 'drove', 'off', 'cliff', 'hit', 'parachute', 'button', 'only', 'find', 'system', 'malfunctioned', 'TV', 'science', 'thing', 'behold', 'am', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'April', 'also', 'like', 'Bonnie', 'am', 'glad', 'came', 'back', 'season', 'three', 'However', 'April', 'was', 'treated', 'really', 'poorly', 'was', 'never', 'properly', 'introduced', 'blue', 'just', 'up', 'mechanic', 'engineer', 'Knight', 'Industries', 'disappear', 'just', 'easily', 'Here', 'today', 'forgotten', 'tomorrow.Still', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'season', 'two', 'good', 'buy', 'shows', 'really', 'are', 'good', 'provide', 'nice', 'break', 'routine', 'trials', 'everyday', 'life', 'Also', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'improved', 'season', 'one', 'Now', 'disks', 'come', 'slim', 'clam', 'shell', 'cases', 'instead', 'wretched', 'fold', 'out', 'booklet', 'season', 'one', 'came']",Knight Rider: Season Two

The car was cool, the driver was awesome, and the plots of good vs. evil were refreshingly clean and direct. April in particular was hot, the perfect combination of brains and beauty(and the way she stands up to Garth Knight is something to be remembered), and is a worthy replacement, albeit a temporary one, for Bonnie Barstow. Great fun all around.(For the record, some people have written on here that the voice of K.I.T.T., William Daniels, passed away in the late 90s. That is not so. I just checked his biography, and he's not only still alive, he's currently filming a new series called Girl meets World, a spinoff of the 90s sitcom Boy Meets World. In both series, he plays the high school principal George Feeny. So rest easy, fans. &#34;K.I.T.T.&#34; is alive and well.)",5,For the record...,1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,884,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'years', 'ever', 'first', 'saw', 'USA', 'Network', 'back', '90s', 'car', 'was', 'cool', 'driver', 'was', 'awesome', 'plots', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'were', 'refreshingly', 'clean', 'direct', 'April', 'particular', 'was', 'hot', 'perfect', 'combination', 'brains', 'beauty', 'way', 'up', 'Garth', 'Knight', 'something', 'be', 'remembered', 'worthy', 'replacement', 'temporary', 'one', 'Bonnie', 'Barstow', 'Great', 'fun', 'around', 'record', 'people', 'have', 'written', 'here', 'voice', 'K.I.T.T.', 'William', 'Daniels', 'passed', 'away', 'late', '90s', 'not', 'so', 'just', 'checked', 'biography', 'not', 'only', 'still', 'alive', 'currently', 'filming', 'new', 'series', 'called', 'Girl', 'meets', 'World', 'spinoff', '90s', 'sitcom', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'series', 'high', 'school', 'principal', 'George', 'Feeny', 'So', 'rest', 'easy', 'fans', '34', 'K.I.T.T.', '34', 'alive', 'well']",Knight Rider: Season Two

882502,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0007LXP5Y,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[12, 12]","One of the more intriguing television shows of the early-1980s, Knight Rider (and K.I.T.T. in particular) captured the imagination of children everywhere while, at the same time, entertaining adults with its effective utilization of a traditional TV action genre. Knight Rider tells the story of an incredible crime fighting team brought together when the terminally-ill billionaire Wilton Knight saves the life of police officer Michael Long after Long gets shot in the face... When the billionaire helps out, providing Long with a new face and a new identity (Michael Knight), the young officer dedicates the remainder of his life to fighting injustice on behalf of the Foundation of Law and Government (FLAG). Singled out by Wilton Knight and aided by the staff of FLAG, Michael is teamed up with an extraordinary vehicle that, if necessary, is capable of fighting bad guys all by itself...Knight Rider features David Hasselhoff in the role of Michael Knight, an ex-cop turned private crime fighter. But the true star of the show is Michael's car, K.I.T.T. (Knight Industries Two Thousand), a sleek black Pontiac Trans-Am impervious to bullets, fire, or most any type of mayhem. Outfitted with state-of-the-art, top secret Artificial Intelligence, K.I.T.T. is not only capable of self-operation (with his mission to protect all human life), but he's outfitted with smoke bombs, flamethrowers, infrared sensors, and countless other nifty gadgets. Able to verbally communicate with humans, K.I.T.T. maintains a special friendship with Michael, developing his own personality (which at times provides comic relief for the show). Just as criminal outlaws of the early-1980s feared the wrath of The A-Team, the prospect of a visit from Michael and K.I.T.T. certainly caused many sleepless nights for America's criminal element...The Knight Rider (Season 2) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the two part season premiere ""Goliath"" in which Michael and K.I.T.T. are forced to do battle with Wilton Knight's ex-wife and son who enjoy the aid of a truck sporting many of the same capabilities as K.I.T.T... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Blind Spot"" in which Michael enlists the aid of a blind woman who is the only witness to a corrupt businessman's illegal practices, and ""Speed Demons"" in which Michael and K.I.T.T. are on high alert when an anonymous tipster warns that the upcoming Foundation sponsored motorcycle race will play home to a murder...Below is a list of episodes included on the Knight Rider (Season 2) DVD:Episode 23 (Goliath: Part 1)Episode 24 (Goliath: Part 2)Episode 25 (Brother's Keeper)Episode 26 (Merchants of Death)Episode 27 (Blind Spot)Episode 28 (Return to Cadiz)Episode 29 (K.I.T.T. the Cat)Episode 30 (Custom K.I.T.T.)Episode 31 (Soul Survivor)Episode 32 (Ring of Fire)Episode 33 (Knightmares)Episode 34 (Silent Knight)Episode 35 (A Knight in Shining Armor)Episode 36 (Diamonds Aren't a Girl's Best Friend)Episode 37 (White-Line Warriors)Episode 38 (Race for Life)Episode 39 (Speed Demons)Episode 40 (Goliath Returns: Part 1)Episode 41 (Goliath Returns: Part 2)Episode 42 (A Good Knight's Work)Episode 43 (Mouth of the Snake: Part 1)Episode 44 (Mouth of the Snake: Part 2)Episode 45 (Let It Be Me)Episode 46 (Big Iron)The DVD Report",5,The talking car everyone still wishes he had...!,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,3296,"['One', 'more', 'intriguing', 'television', 'shows', 'early-1980s', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'K.I.T.T', 'particular', 'captured', 'imagination', 'children', 'everywhere', 'same', 'time', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'effective', 'utilization', 'traditional', 'TV', 'action', 'genre', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'story', 'incredible', 'crime', 'fighting', 'team', 'brought', 'together', 'when', 'terminally-ill', 'billionaire', 'Wilton', 'Knight', 'life', 'police', 'officer', 'Michael', 'Long', 'Long', 'shot', 'face', 'When', 'billionaire', 'out', 'providing', 'Long', 'new', 'face', 'new', 'identity', 'Michael', 'Knight', 'young', 'officer', 'remainder', 'life', 'fighting', 'injustice', 'behalf', 'Foundation', 'Law', 'Government', 'FLAG', 'Singled', 'out', 'Wilton', 'Knight', 'aided', 'staff', 'FLAG', 'Michael', 'teamed', 'up', 'extraordinary', 'vehicle', 'necessary', 'capable', 'fighting', 'bad', 'guys', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'role', 'Michael', 'Knight', 'ex-cop', 'turned', 'private', 'crime', 'fighter', 'true', 'star', 'show', 'Michael', 'car', 'K.I.T.T', 'Knight', 'Industries', 'Two', 'Thousand', 'sleek', 'black', 'Pontiac', 'Trans-Am', 'impervious', 'bullets', 'fire', 'most', 'type', 'mayhem', 'Outfitted', 'state-of-the-art', 'top', 'secret', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', 'K.I.T.T', 'not', 'only', 'capable', 'self-operation', 'mission', 'protect', 'human', 'life', 'outfitted', 'smoke', 'bombs', 'flamethrowers', 'infrared', 'sensors', 'countless', 'other', 'nifty', 'gadgets', 'Able', 'verbally', 'communicate', 'humans', 'K.I.T.T', 'special', 'friendship', 'Michael', 'developing', 'own', 'personality', 'times', 'comic', 'relief', 'show', 'Just', 'criminal', 'outlaws', 'early-1980s', 'feared', 'wrath', 'A-Team', 'prospect', 'visit', 'Michael', 'K.I.T.T', 'certainly', 'caused', 'many', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'America', 'criminal', 'element', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'action-packed', 'episodes', 'including', 'two', 'part', 'season', 'Goliath', 'Michael', 'K.I.T.T', 'are', 'forced', 'do', 'battle', 'Wilton', 'Knight', 'ex-wife', 'son', 'who', 'enjoy', 'aid', 'truck', 'sporting', 'many', 'same', 'capabilities', 'K.I.T.T', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', 'Blind', 'Spot', 'Michael', 'aid', 'blind', 'woman', 'who', 'only', 'witness', 'corrupt', 'businessman', 'illegal', 'practices', 'Speed', 'Demons', 'Michael', 'K.I.T.T', 'are', 'high', 'alert', 'when', 'anonymous', 'tipster', 'upcoming', 'Foundation', 'sponsored', 'motorcycle', 'race', 'will', 'play', 'home', 'murder', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'Episode', '23', 'Goliath', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '24', 'Goliath', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '25', 'Brother', 'Keeper', 'Episode', '26', 'Merchants', 'Death', 'Episode', '27', 'Blind', 'Spot', 'Episode', '28', 'Return', 'Cadiz', 'Episode', '29', 'K.I.T.T', 'Cat', 'Episode', '30', 'Custom', 'K.I.T.T', 'Episode', '31', 'Soul', 'Survivor', 'Episode', '32', 'Ring', 'Fire', 'Episode', '33', 'Knightmares', 'Episode', '34', 'Silent', 'Knight', 'Episode', '35', 'Knight', 'Shining', 'Armor', 'Episode', '36', 'Diamonds', 'Are', ""n't"", 'Girl', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Episode', '37', 'White-Line', 'Warriors', 'Episode', '38', 'Race', 'Life', 'Episode', '39', 'Speed', 'Demons', 'Episode', '40', 'Goliath', 'Returns', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '41', 'Goliath', 'Returns', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '42', 'Good', 'Knight', 'Work', 'Episode', '43', 'Mouth', 'Snake', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '44', 'Mouth', 'Snake', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '45', 'Let', 'Be', 'Me', 'Episode', '46', 'Big', 'Iron', 'DVD', 'Report']",Knight Rider: Season Two

One is the lack of ""Behind the Scenes"" material. Shame on Universal for not unlocking the vaults. You know there is a wealth of bloopers, outtakes, and general footage the KR faithful would have given their eye teeth to have included in this set. Mores the pity they cannot see that pleasing the faithful will equal more profits.Problem two - Same complaint as all DVD sets. Yes, we understand the ramifications of copying the DVD, and yes we are quite well aware by the 20th time we are watching a Universal product. Why do they constantly screw this one up? Put the theft and ID info on the first disk and leave the rest alone. It irks to no end not being able to bypass all the ""mandetory"" warning labels and such - why can't you just let us watch the episodes?Yes, two-sided DVDs can be a pain, but the trade-off is having a more disks if Universal were to use single-sided disks. I haven't noticed anything out-of-the-ordinary when watching them - as others have written - and they appear to play just fine for me.The bottom line is this - don't set your sights too high, and you won't be disappointed.

882524,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B0007LXP5Y,Taheen Lopez,"[2, 6]","I love this over-the-top 1983-84 Season DVD of KNIGHT RIDER and it is even better than KNIGHT RIDER's 1982-83 Season even though this season left us mourning the loss of the foxy Bonnie Barstow, because the 2nd Season was more upgraded & even more stellar with more action in it than the 1st Season was along with the fact that this 1983-84 Season was also the season when NBC had moved KNIGHT RIDER to Sundays since NBC had announced in the Summer of 1983 that KNIGHT RIDER was jumping to a new day & time on Sunday August 28, 1983 at 8PM in order to help reel in more viewers to tune into watching this show since Fridays are usually family night which makes it harder to make time for your favorite shows as opposed to Sunday nights since most people have to go to work and to school on Mondays which decreased scheduling conflicts for KNIGHT RIDER viewers along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER was still in its honeymoon phase of the show during this season & was still wiping everything out in the Nielsen ratings on top of that.Therefore when NBC moved this Supercar drama to Sunday nights in the late Summer/early Fall of 1983, it gave me something to look forward to every Sunday, since I've never been too fond of Sundays, despite the fact that I still preferred KNIGHT RIDER on Friday nights, but it helped the DUKES OF HAZZARD get some of its viewers back since KNIGHT RIDER and the DUKES OF HAZZARD weren't on the same night anymore, especially not at the same time slot which helped get more people to tune in to watching the DUKES OF HAZZARD on Fridays again.Therefore K.I.T.T. wasn't the hottest car on Friday nights anymore and the General Lee pretty much became the hottest car on Friday nights again even though KNIGHT RIDER was still K.O.ing the DUKES OF HAZZARD in the ratings and had already stole the Dukes thunder when this show premiered on NBC in the Autumn of 1982 since the Knight 2000 was able to do 10 times more than the General Lee could ever do.Therefore CBS probably would've ended up cancelling the DUKES OF HAZZARD by the Spring of 1984 if NBC kept KNIGHT RIDER on Friday nights and moved KNIGHT RIDER from 9PM to 8PM on Fridays instead of moving KNIGHT RIDER from Friday nights at 9PM to Sunday nights at 8PM since KITT practically beat the General Lee to a pulp & really would've conflicted with the DUKES OF HAZZARD's 8PM time slot on CBS every Friday night along with the fact that the DUKES OF HAZZARD had already lost a lot of viewers through KNIGHT RIDER in the Fall of 1982 on top of that, but what I found kind of intriguing about NBC moving KNIGHT RIDER to Sundays in the early Fall of 1983 was the fact that KNIGHT RIDER had been shown on a Sunday night instead of a Friday night when it made its debut on NBC in September of 1982 since the pilot episode of KNIGHT RIDER was the only episode from the 1st Season that had its original air-date on a Sunday instead of a Friday, but the rest of the 1st Season episodes were shown on Fridays since KNIGHT RIDER was shown every Friday night at 9PM at the time starting with the ""Deadly Manuevers"" episode.Therefore I was at first under the impression that maybe NBC was going to have KNIGHT RIDER on Sunday nights instead of Friday nights when they showed the pilot episode of KNIGHT RIDER for the very first time on NBC even though I had already heard in the Summer of 1982 that KNIGHT RIDER was going to be the hottest car on Friday nights like the General Lee from the DUKES OF HAZZARD used to be and that KNIGHT RIDER was coming to NBC in the Fall of 1982, but for some reason NBC had showed KNIGHT RIDER on a Sunday just that one time in its 1st Season, which may have been due to scheduling conflicts on NBC and/or perhaps to get more people to tune in to watching this show in order to get people hooked on it since it was the kind of show about a supercar that nobody had ever seen before as well as the car every other person wanted back then, especially kids, including myself.In addition to that, I would have to say that KNIGHT RIDER's 2nd Season was probably when this show was at its peak and when KNIGHT RIDER had its best ratings since this show was still skyrocketing in the Nielsen ratings at an all-time high during this season since the ratings in KNIGHT RIDER's Second Season were even better than its First Season and better than its last 2 seasons since there was a slight decline in ratings when KNIGHT RIDER hit its Third Season, despite Bonnie's return to the show and April's departure from this show in the Autumn of 1984, plus the ratings dropped drastically to an all-time low during its last season when this shows reputation was tarnished in the Winter of 1986 which led to its cancellation in the Summer of 1986 after completing an unsuccessful Fourth Season on NBC.Therefore the ratings on KNIGHT RIDER were never as good after this season and were never as strong as the first 2 seasons either after KITT got a new dashboard installed by Bonnie when she returned to the show in the 3rd Season and when newer shows like the short-lived Supercycle drama STREET HAWK premiered in the Winter of 1985 & stole KITTs thunder nearly killing this show practically beating it to a pulp since STREET HAWK had outclassed the Knight 2000 & had better ratings than KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF both did on top of that despite the fact that this show had better ratings when K.I.T.T. had his old dashboard than when he had his new dashboard since KITT was more upgraded with more additional upgraded features and accessories that he didn't have in this season or in the first 2 seasons either, which you could see for yourself when you watch an episode from this season and compare to watching an episode from the Third Season.So not only did STREET HAWK K.O. KNIGHT RIDER in the Nielsen ratings, STREET HAWK & Jesse Mach(Rex Smith)also stole ""The Man, The Machine"" motto away from Michael Knight(David Hasselhoff) & KITT too since the ratings on STREET HAWK were at its peak when it made its debut on Friday January 4, 1985 on NBC's rival network ABC.Therefore, KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF couldn't even touch STREET HAWK during its 3 1/2-month run on ABC either, but the fact that STREET HAWK was too closely related to KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF & kept giving viewers too much of the same thing every weekend not only led to its own cancellation, it also led to the cancellation & declining ratings of KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF too, especially since STREET HAWK premiered too soon after AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER both did since STREET HAWK made its series premiere in the Winter of 1985 even though it was originally scheduled to debut in the Fall of 1984, AIRWOLF made its series premiere on CBS the previous year back in the Winter of 1984, and KNIGHT RIDER made its series premiere in the Fall of 1982.As a matter of fact, I was 11 years old in the 5th grade at Desert Gardens Elementary School in El Centro when this season was running on NBC.I also noticed in the Second Season that KITT actually had some more upgraded features than they showed in the First Season too, even though KITT still had the same dashboard as he did in the 1st Season along with the fact that when David Hasselhoff had announced in a TV Guide article in June of 1983 that KNIGHT RIDER was moving to Sunday nights in the early Fall of 1983 and that the producers of this show had used 4 black '82 Pontiac Trans Ams to run the show, not just 1 Trans Am, in order to prevent costly repairs, since Hasselhoff even explained that in actuality whenever Michael & KITT did a stunt scene that they would use KITT lookalike cars to do the stunts and that sometimes the cars they used for all the stunt scenes would even break in half whenever the car landed during a turbo boost scene and would frequently have to replace and repair them whenever the outside of the stunt cars would get banged up or damaged by replacing the outer shell of the Trans Am stunt cars with a new outer shell underneath kind of like peeling the skin off of an onion, which was very similar to how the producers of the DUKES OF HAZZARD ran that show with the General Lee and how the producers ran theFALL GUY with Colt Seavers fancy GMC Sierra Grande pick up since the General Lee and Colt's pick up both used to get racked up frequently during the stunt scenes on both the FALL GUY & the DUKES OF HAZZARD.In fact I noticed that in most of the stunt scenes on KNIGHT RIDER, especially in the first 2 seasons of that show that they had Michael driving a black Trans Am KITT lookalike car with a regular round sterring wheel instead of using the main KITT with the fancy pilot style steering wheel with the fancy dashboard, especially when Michael drove KITT on rugged terrain or did major bumps or drove on 2 wheels in ski-mode since it would've been too hard, too risky and too expensive to do it with the main KITT with the fancy dashboard.In addition something else I had noticed about KNIGHT RIDER's 1983-84 Season was this season had more 2-hour special episodes than any other season throughout KNIGHT RIDER's whole 4-year run on NBC like ""Goliath"", ""Mouth Of The Snake"", & ""Goliath Returns"" along with the fact that this was the season when technician April Curtis(Rebecca Holden)replaced spunky technician Bonnie Barstow(Patricia McPherson), which was of course before Bonnie's return to the show in the Fall of 1984 when April departed along with William Daniels who played the high-strung arrogant Dr. Mark Craig on ST. ELSEWHERE providing his recurring uncredited role as the voice of KITT and Edward Mulhare making his recurring role as Michael's British overlyconcerned boss(Devon Miles)whom was also like a father figure to Michael just like Dr. Huer(Tim O'Connor)was to Buck(Gil Gerard) on BUCK ROGERS:IN THE 25TH CENTURY, but when April replaced Bonnie in this season it felt kind of like it did when Deputy Cletus(Rick Hurst)had replaced his predecessor Deputy Enos(Sonny Shroyer)as Sheriffs Rosco's fellow deputy on the DUKES OF HAZZARD in the Dukes 3rd Season when Enos left the DUKES OF HAZZARD in the Fall of 1980, but when Bonnie returned to KNIGHT RIDER, it felt just like when Deputy Enos(Sonny Shroyer)had returned to the DUKES OF HAZZARD as Rosco's fellow deputy again in the Dukes 5th Season when Deputy Cletus(Rick Hurst)had eventually departed from that show in the Fall of 1982 after only 5 episodes.In fact the reason why Bonnie's departure and replacement by April on KNIGHT RIDER felt just like Enos's departure and replacement by Cletus on the DUKES OF HAZZARD was because most people obviously preferred Bonnie to April and wanted Bonnie back on KNIGHT RIDER just like most people preferred Enos to Cletus and wanted Enos back on the DUKES OF HAZZARD since April didn't stand out as well as Bonnie did just like Cletus didn't stand out as well as Enos did.In addition to that, it was interesting seeing David Hasselhoff playing his first dual role in the ""Goliath"" episode and then again in the ""Goliath Returns"" episode as both the reclusive crime-fighting investigator(Michael Knight) and as Wilton Knight's evil estranged son(Garthe Knight).The ""Merchants Of Death"" episode was also kinda neat when Michael & KITT go up against a futuristic superchopper with heavy artillery, since it was kind of like watching KNIGHT RIDER battle AIRWOLF in a way, even though AIRWOLF hadn't even came out yet, which takes me back to memory lane when the Superchopper drama AIRWOLF made it's debut on CBS in January of 1984, especially since AIRWOLF became in hefty competition with KNIGHT RIDER along with the fact that AIRWOLF was on CBS every Saturday night while KNIGHT RIDER was on NBC every Sunday night, but KNIGHT RIDER still got better ratings than AIRWOLF did.It was also interesting watching the recluse Michael reunite with his ex-fiancee Stevie(Catherine Hickland) in the ""Let It Be Me"" episode when he goes undercover as a singer to flush out the culprits who had Stevie's former band member/lover(John Patrick-Reger) killed along with the fact that the ""Let It Be Me"" episode used intriguing clips from the ""White Bird"" episode of when Michael was getting reaquainted with Stevie after his identity change and then Michael and Stevie singing a love song called ""Let It Be Me"" to one another towards the end of that episode just before saying another tearful goodbye along with the fact that I noticed KITT and many other things were more upgraded in the ""Let It Be Me"" episode than they were in the ""White Bird"" episode along with the fact that KITT and numerous other things on this show were more upgraded and improved in KNIGHT RIDER's 2nd Season than they were in the 1st Season, even though KITT didn't even have his new dashboard yet, but coincidentally, David Hasselhoff and Catherine Hickland were married in real life at the time during KNIGHT RIDER's 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Seasons, but ended up in divorce not too long after NBC had cancelled this show in August of 1986.I also noticed that Knight Rider's 1983-84 Season also had a lot of cool songs from the early 80's and even quite a few from the 70's that were resung by different artists on this show.For instance in the episodes*GOLIATH played the song ""Gimme Shelter"" by The Rolling Stones*BROTHERS KEEPER played the song ""She Works Hard For The Money"" by Donna Summer*MERCHANTS OF DEATH played the songs ""California Girls"" by The Beach Boys and ""Breakdown"" by Tom Petty*BLIND SPOT played the songs ""Maniac"" by Michael Sembello and ""Oye Como Va"" by Carlos Santana*RETURN TO CADIZ played the song ""Every Breath You Take"" by The Police*KITT THE CAT played the sings ""Telefone"" by Sheena Easton*CUSTOM KITT played the songs ""Promises Promises"" by Naked Eyes and ""One Thing Leads To Another"" by The Fixx*SILENT KNIGHT played the songs ""Owner Of A Lonely Heart"" by Yes and ""Gypsy"" by Fleetwood Mac*DIAMONDS AREN'T A GIRLS BEST FRIEND played the songs ""Human Touch"" by Rick Springfield and ""Ain't Nobody"" by Chaka Khan*WHITE-LINE WARRIORS played the songs ""Crumblin Down"" by John Cougar-Mellencamp, ""Maniac"" by Michael Sembello, and ""Rhiannon"" by Fleetwood Mac*GOLIATH RETURNS played the song ""Heart & Soul"" by Huey Lewis & The News*MOUTH OF THE SNAKE played the song ""Stay With Me Tonight"" by Jeffrey Osborne*BIG IRON played the song ""Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys"" by Johnny LeeBut for some reason they didn't play the song ""Little Red Corvette"" by Prince in the ""White-Line Warriors"" episode or even in the ""Knight Of The Drones"" episode like they should have since that song was originally played on those episodes during their original air-dates on NBC and even when KNIGHT RIDER was shown in reruns on cable TV and in syndication.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Tim O'Connor in the ""Brother's Keeper"" episode after his co-starring days as Dr. Huer on BUCK ROGERS*Mario Marcelino in the ""Race For Life"" episode before his co-starring days as Hunter & Molenski's fellow officer(Det.

LOBO, ONE LIFE TO LIVE, ALL MY CHILDREN, and before his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARAThe KNIGHT RIDER-Season 2 DVD also provided a brief summary of each episode including their original air-dates just like Universal did with the KNIGHT RIDER-Season 1 DVD and the KNIGHT RIDER-Season 3 DVD, plus they showed each and every episode complete and uncut just like they were shown when I watched them for the first time on NBC back in the early 1980'sFor instance, the original air-dates to each 1983-1984 Season are10/2/83-GOLIATH10/9/83-BROTHER'S KEEPER10/16/83-MERCHANTS OF DEATH10/23/83-BLIND

BE ME5/27/84: BIG IRONKNIGHT RIDER's Second Season was also the 2nd most phenomenal year of KNIGHT RIDER on NBC too along with the fact that this was the season that gave me something to look forward to every Sunday, especially since I've never been very fond of Sundays, but at least I had something else to look forward to on Sunday nights before going back to school on Mondays, since KNIGHT RIDER was part of NBC's Sunday night line-up at the time along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER was at its peak of its 4-year run on NBC during this season on top of that.In fact, that reminds me of when NBC's motto was ""BE THERE"", since that was their slogan on NBC back then from the Fall of 1983 thru the Spring of 1984.I also noticed that after watching the 2-hour special episodes like ""Mouth Of The Snake"" and ""Goliath Returns"" on this KNIGHT RIDER-Season Two DVD that USA, WGN, Sci-Fi Channel, TV Land, and all the channels that showed the KNIGHT RIDER reruns in syndication had cut out so many scenes, especially in the 2-hour episodes, which was great to be able to see uncut, but such a shame that there were so many scenes in each episode that I didn't even know were actually there before, especially in the ""Mouth Of The Snake"" episode and ""Goliath Returns"" episodes, which made it seem like about half the scenes in those episodes were deleted to allot more time for commercials in between.The only problem I have with this KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 2 DVD is for some reason some of the episodes like ""Knightmares"", ""White-Line Warriors"" skip or freeze a lot at times, which may be due to each disc being dual-sided, which is perhaps part of the reason why Universal had decided to make & release the KNIGHT RIDER-The Complete Series DVD recently to compensate for all the flaws that Universal made with the 2-sided disc of each individual season box set of KNIGHT RIDER by redoing each episode on single-sided discs instead of double-sided discs, despite all the budget cuts and weak economy we've been having lately from the recession going on right now that former president(George Bush, Jr.)and Governor(Arnold Schwarzenneger) caused us.Additionally, the one thing I could never understand about this season was the ""Goliath"" episode was not only the Season Premiere to KNIGHT RIDER's 2nd Season, it was also the very first episode with April Curtis(Rebecca Holden), but for some reason on the show there was never any formal introductions made that April had joined Michael, Devon, KITT, and the Foundation as their new co-worker as well as KITT's new mechanic acting as if April had already been on the show all along with no mention about Bonnie Barstow(Patricia McPherson) or why Bonnie left the Foundation and got replaced by April either, plus I also noticed that Michael didn't flirt with April nearly as much as he flirted with Bonnie either, which was probably an indicator that Michael preferred Bonnie to April like most other people did.In addition to that in the ""Big Iron"" episode, ""Big Iron"" was not only the Season Finale episode to KNIGHT RIDER's 1983-84 Season, but Michael & KITT mentioned April's name a lot in the ""Big Iron"" episode along with the fact that Rebecca Holden's name and credits were still in the introduction to the ""Big Iron"" episode like all the other episodes of this season even though April didn't even come out in the ""Big Iron"" episode, despite the fact that Michael & KITT kept mentioning April's name a lot in the ""Big Iron"" episode giving us the impression that April was still a part of the show and wasn't about to leave the show or the Foundation by a long shot, especially since ""Big Iron"" was the last episode of KNIGHT RIDER's Second Season, but then Bonnie returns to the show and to the Foundation as KITT's mechanic in the following episode ""Knight Of The Drones"", which by the way was the Season Premiere to KNIGHT RIDER's Third Season when Bonnie gives KITT a major upgrade with a major facelift with a new dashboard.Therefore in actuality the ""Let It Be Me"" episode was Rebecca Holden's last real episode on this show, not the ""Big Iron"" episode since the ""Let It Be Me"" episode was when April made her last appearance on this show before Patricia McPherson's return to the show in September of 1984, but I also noticed that April didn't appear in the ""Mouth Of The Snake"" episode either, which therefore means there were at least 2 episodes in this season without April Curtis, despite her name on the introduction and credits to this season.Overall, I recommend this DVD to anyone who bought and liked KNIGHT RIDER-Season One and I think anybody who was a KNIGHT RIDER fan like me who watched KNIGHT RIDER religiously on NBC every Friday night in the 1st Season and every Sunday night in the 2nd and 3rd Seasons would agree with me on this review for KNIGHT RIDER's Second Season.Something else I noticed in this 1983-1984 Season was the hotel they used for the episodes ""Soul Survivor"", ""KITT The Cat"", and ""Goliath Returns"" was the SHERATON UNIVERSAL in Universal City and that they had also shown us the Universal movie distribution building in Universal City in the ""KITT The Cat"" episode too.In the meantime, I just got word that Paramount will be releasing the detective drama MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 on DVD on March 9th, 2010 and is now available for pre-order along with the fact this this DVD season of KNIGHT RIDER and MATT HOUSTON both take me back to memory lane to the Summer of 1988 when KNIGHT RIDER was shown at 5PM followed by MATT HOUSTON ar 6PM weekdays on KTLA from July of 1988 thru September of 1988.By the way, the Shout Factory will finally be releasing STREET HAWK out on DVD on Tuesday July 13th, 2010 which shall give all you high-tech fantasy TV show fans out there something else to look forward to.",5,A definite upgrade to Season 1!,1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,24006,"['love', 'over-the-top', '1983-84',
