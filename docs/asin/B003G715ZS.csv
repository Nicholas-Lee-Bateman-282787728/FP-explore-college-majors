After this DVD, Kevin Hart might slide in as no. 2. I laughed so hard I cried three times while watching this DVD. I knew he was funny, but after I watched him on ""The Mo'Nique Show"" tonight, then I REALLY wanted to see this DVD. ""Say it with your chest"" and his stories on Mo'Nique's show about his uncle were funny. His analysis of women being mad when men have a good time reminded me a little of Chris Rock saying women hate it when you smile and it's not because of them, but Kevin Hart took it a step further. I know SO many women who have that, ""Do you, boo boo"" attitude. What was hilarious was I could envision most of the real people he talked about. But nothing beat his thug speech before a fight. I rewound that at least five times just to listen to him say it again. I can guarantee you I'll be mimicking that the next time somebody makes me mad, just for the helluvit. Great stuff. My advice: If you don't feel like working out one night, laughing burns calories. Let Kevin Hart be your fitness trainer (but make sure nobody's got their ""thing"" out).Kinda sorta cons: I could've down without the use of the b-word, but I honestly didn't get the impression he REALLY talks to his wife like that. I let it go. He got some flack on another movie site for the homosexual joke at the beginning about his son. I will admit that I understand why some people were offended, but I took it as a joke, especially when he then made fun of himself for catching a kiss. Did I laugh? Nah, but I didn't get mad either.
