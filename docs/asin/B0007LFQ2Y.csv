The storyline really doesn't do a good job of capturing your attention, and I found myself fast-forwarding through most of it.

What wasn't believable to me was the guy who played the teacher's husband.  I definitely thought he was gay; like really, what man does as much as he did for the family voluntarily?  Anyway, I was waiting for him to say he was having an affair too, but it never happened.  Lastly, the ending was a little weak in my opinion.",3,It was alright,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,402,"['plot', 'was', 'good', 'chemistry', 'leading', 'ladies', 'was', 'believable', 'What', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'teacher', 'husband', 'definitely', 'thought', 'was', 'gay', 'really', 'what', 'man', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'family', 'voluntarily', 'Anyway', 'was', 'waiting', 'say', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'too', 'never', 'happened', 'Lastly', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'weak', 'opinion']",N/A

There's way too much misery and death and not enough kissing and comedy. Which is why this movie gets two stars. Yes, production values could be better. A lot better. The acting is self-conscious. But its heart is in the right place, and so are its love scenes. The characters don't die. It has moments of amusement and some of the dialogue rings true. It's worth a rental.",2,"Good intentions ... but just OK ""Intentions""",1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,446,"['So', 'when', 'lesbian', 'romance', 'movies', 'bar', 'not', 'high', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'misery', 'death', 'not', 'enough', 'kissing', 'comedy', 'Which', 'why', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'Yes', 'production', 'values', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'lot', 'better', 'acting', 'self-conscious', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'so', 'are', 'love', 'scenes', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'die', 'moments', 'amusement', 'dialogue', 'rings', 'true', 'rental']",N/A
