People do change, evolve and lead interesting lives in the gay community--if I can use that term in its most inclusive sense--but you'd never get that from this awful thing. Sometimes, cute boys can make-up for shortcomings, like no story, but not this. Stay away. Don't even believe the hype in the description--FALSE ADVERTISING.",1,Ordinary. Nothing new.

942063,A2PJU5MFGYFZN0,B000BGS8KM,Pitbulltje,"[0, 0]","I watched this one after I had seen ""Devotee"" (french independent movie, check out my next review).There are two things these two share: they last less than 60 minutes and they are low-budgets. And that's it.In case of ""Boystown"" everything is way too amatourish. I admit I expected something more elaborated (judging by the cover). Instead, I got a half-baked product.The story line is so so. Bunch of gay friends and their problems. Lot of cliches. I cannot understand how come anybody could find it interesting and wonderful (vide those two more than positive reviews).Acting is really nothing here. The gardener, even if I think he was the hottest and he earns the second star for it, then it's not diffucult to notice that he keeps smiling all the time (was he on high while filming???).The drag performance...One of the worst I have ever seen. And it's one that was supposed to be directed...To make it even worse, the film is bad edited. The sound has got bad quality, which is disturbing.If I had to live in such town, I would have moved out within first hour.",2,This queertown is lame,1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,1068,"['watched', 'one', 'had', 'seen', 'Devotee', 'french', 'independent', 'movie', 'check', 'next', 'review', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'two', 'share', 'last', 'less', '60', 'minutes', 'are', 'low-budgets', 'it.In', 'case', 'Boystown', 'everything', 'way', 'too', 'amatourish', 'admit', 'expected', 'something', 'more', 'elaborated', 'judging', 'cover', 'Instead', 'got', 'half-baked', 'product.The', 'story', 'line', 'so', 'so', 'Bunch', 'gay', 'friends', 'problems', 'Lot', 'cliches', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'come', 'anybody', 'could', 'find', 'interesting', 'wonderful', 'two', 'more', 'positive', 'reviews', '.Acting', 'really', 'nothing', 'here', 'gardener', 'even', 'think', 'was', 'hottest', 'second', 'star', 'then', 'not', 'diffucult', 'notice', 'smiling', 'time', 'was', 'high', 'filming', '.The', 'drag', 'performance', 'One', 'worst', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'directed', 'make', 'even', 'worse', 'film', 'bad', 'edited', 'sound', 'got', 'bad', 'quality', 'disturbing.If', 'had', 'live', 'such', 'town', 'would', 'have', 'moved', 'out', 'first', 'hour']",Boystown

The acting was not horrible but bad enough that I kept losing interest in the movie.  Two of the actors were in the movie Heels and they did a better job acting there.  The actors were really cute but I just didn't care about the story as it moved on because of the acting.

But the episode is a little raw and needs to be ""spiked"" up a little.  I was slightly disappointed.  The characters were briefly introduced and the story line was limited.  I gave it 4 stars because even though this episode is raw, I feel it has potential.  In my opinion, they have my attention with the plot.  But the story line is a little weak.  I think they need to introduce the characters more.Will I get more episodes, most likely.  Even though this first episode was weak, I would like to find out what happens....Its not for the QAF fans though.  This show is different.
