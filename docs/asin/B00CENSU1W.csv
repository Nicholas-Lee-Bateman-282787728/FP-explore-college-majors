Unfortunately, timeline themed plotlines have been done to death and the JL movies have done ""alternate"" realities before in which our favorite heroes are fighting other versions of themselves.

You kinda get the ""been there done that"" vibe while watching.Overall, the movie is entertaining and I liked it.

1646255,A1YZMGEC9ELI4L,B00CENSU1W,"A.P. Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[1, 2]","When the Flash cranks up the superspeed and travels back in time to right a painful wrong, the timeline is drastically altered and he awakes in a present that's not the one he knows. There's a war raging between the Atlanteans and Amazons, Batman uses guns, Cyborg works for the government and Superman is nowhere to be found. Worse, the Flash no longer has his superpowers thus cannot travel back in time to repair the damage and restore the timeline to the one he knew.Powerless and with no Justice League to turn to, the Flash must decide how he's going to change the course of history and if he's willing to lose someone he loves in the effort to save the lives of many.This flick is the ultimate fanboy trip for Flash lovers. He's the main character and this is the first time in DC animated movie history that he gets the focus. You got superspeed, time travel, alternate timelines, the Speedforce and more. Way cool and, frankly, it's about time DC took a break from Superman and Batman as the go-to guys for movies, even in the context of a JLA movie. With a new Flash TV series in production as of this review, I'm thinking this was DC's way of priming the pump, so to speak, to get audiences ready for more adventures with the Scarlet Speedster.This movie's strength lies in two areas: the Flash, and time travel.On the Flash: you got a quick recap of his origin, a real sense for what drives Barry Allen, multiple amazing displays of superspeed (especially that running sequence at the end), and a hero to root for from start to finish. I loved it. As a DC guy, I like the Flash, but this film really made me appreciate him and care for him all the more as it gave a strong face to his mythology and character.On time travel: I love time travel stories. The more scientifically accurate and plausible the better, but I'll take just about any story that deals with time travel, parallel universes and butterfly effects. I write about that stuff in my own fiction, for crying out loud. Here, DC went to great lengths to explain the time travel in a plausible way and apply what we know of its possibility as realistically as possible in the context of the movie. Nice. The DVD extras that go further into this are an added bonus for us time travel enthusiasts and are much appreciated.Storywise, I loved this movie and the twists and turns it took made me go, ""Man, that's awesome,"" more than once. When I found out the history behind the Batman of the alternate timeline I went nuts. So cool and so utterly tragic. Perfect for Batman. And Superman's portrayal in the alternate timeline? Crazy! Putting all that against a backdrop of an Atlantean vs Amazon war added a breath of fresh air to DC's animated movies because, like I said, it was relieving to stay away from putting the spotlight on Superman or Batman. (Granted, Batman plays a big part in this movie, but in such a way that it's not our Batman but another, which makes it fresh.)The animated style chosen for this flick I wasn't crazy about at first, to be honest. The small heads and wider bodies looked weird. It grows on you, though, and eventually you get used to it. The color scheme and bleak tone throughout added to the overall feel of what was a heavy story, thus sucking you in further.This is not a movie for kids, though. There's a lot of violence and gore, adult themes and some language. While I appreciate ""grown up"" superhero movies, I wish these elements would be scaled back a bit so I could show my kids these flicks and go on super adventures with them instead of having to shelve the DVD until they're older so they can watch it.From a superhero fan's standpoint, Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox is a stellar movie adapted from the graphic novel by Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert.Recommended.",5,"Flash Fans Rejoice!

The end of the story effectively rebooted the DC Universe and gave us the current status quo, known as the DCnU (DC new Universe) or New 52 (after the number of launch titles when the reboot happened). Costumes changed (Superman lost his underoos), and histories were retconned, and it was glorious. But that's for another time, this is about ""Flashpoint Paradox"" and the jaw dropping greatness of it.Though the title has ""Justice League"" in it this is very much a story about everyone's favorite Speedster, the Flash. I mean his name is part of the title. The story begins with Flash (Justin Chambers, ""Grey's Anatomy"")  having to take on a group of his villains, collectively referred to as ""The Rogues,"" and when he's outgunned he calls for the Justice League for back-up. When his opposite number and arch nemesis Professor Zoom aka The Reverse Flash (C. Thomas Howell, ""Amazing Spiderman"") makes a statement that hits a little too close to home Flash goes for a run. When he wakes up the next day things have changed drastically. He is in a world where the Justice League or Superman never existed, Cyborg is the country's greatest hero, Batman is a gun carrying vigilante, and the Amazons and Atlantis are about to begin a war that will destroy the planet. Without his powers Flash, now just plain old Barry Allen must figure out what has happened to the world before it's too late.To give away any more of the story would be almost criminal. If you don't know the details finding them out as you go along is definitely part of the fun with this story. The other part is seeing completely different versions of your favorite characters. Wonder Woman (Vanessa Marshal returning to the role from ""JL: Crisis on Two Earths"") and Aquaman (Cary Elwes, ""Saw, ""Princess Bride"") are much darker characters than we're used to seeing, and their titles Queen of the Amazons and King of Atlantis are front and center, as are their militaristic ambitions. Batman (Kevin McKidd, ""Percy Jackson,"" ""Grey's Anatomy"") is a completely different person, so it makes his change a little easier to deal with. And we again get some Cyborg (Michael B. Jordan, ""Chronicle) which is always good, and he gets to be the hero of the country here. The rest of the cast is good even if they don't get a lot to say with Dana Delany, Nathan Fillion and Ron Perlman returning to voice the characters of Lois Lane, Green Lantern Hal Jordan and Deathstroke from ""Superman: The Animated Series,"" ""Justice League: Doom"" and ""Teen Titans"" respectively. Danny Huston also has a bit part as General Sam Lane. Andrea Romano does it yet again, and Jay Oliva's direction is perfect.The animation is just fantastic with character designs by Phil Burassa who did designs for the last two Justice League animated films as well as the ""Young Justice"" series. These though are some insanely built heroes, but they still look amazing, not like when the drawings in ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"" where they came off looking like ""Masters of the Universe"" figures being animated. This is more like Japanese animation mixed with American comic art. The action is intense too. I mean REALLY intense. There are some pretty violent and brutal fights and scenes in this. Definitely earns it PG-13 rating. I found myself slackjawed a few times throughout the film. DC definitely pushed the envelope this time, and it was well worth it. The story is what really keeps you intrigued though, and the humanity that it illustrates among these powerful beings, and as I said this is Flash's story and following him through this dark, strange world is a real journey.This was a really fun flick and if you've been a fan of these so far, this one definitely won't disappoint you. The only issue I had was that it got me wanting to see more alternate takes on the characters, and DC has a whole line called Elseworlds and they've got a few great stories that would be amazing animated, but I digress. Anyway, this film has an after credits scene that leads directly into the next film, ""Justice League: War"" which makes sense as it tells of the origin of the JL in the DCnU, so I look forward to it. As usual, the special features were few but the featurettes are good, and the classic episodes are always fun. So definitely pick this up if you want to watch a great action flick, with some heart, amazing visuals, and a few surprises too.",5,One Change makes all the difference!,1385078400,"11 22,

We would dress up our cat Roberto as the monkey Gleek. One year, we went to another prom together at our high school dressed up as the Donnie and Marie version of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. Our open-mouthed kiss that night  became quite the sensation when it appeared in our school yearbook before anyone knew Luke and Leia were related.

I understand that this is escapism but, when you have ripped characters with small heads, they kind of look ridiculous.

Otherwise, my love of these animated features is what I look forward to when I go to Amazon.com and look up certain animated features that I hear about finally coming out on DVD.

There was no clear nod/event/action to the audience that Barry Allen had taken any sort of action that changed the course of time. It simply has Barry wake up at his workstation and run out of the office to slip and fall on the steps, only to find his mother waiting for him.  Barry quickly finds (after a 13 mile trip from Central City to Gotham City) that in addition to not having his speed abilities that Bruce Wayne was killed on that fateful night, and Dr. Thomas Wayne became Batman, and Bruce's mother was driven mad by the murder of Bruce that she has become this world's Joker.  Oh and by the way, Aquaman and Wonder Woman have an affair which causes Aquaman's wife to seek revenge on Wonder Woman (why she did not attack her husband, who knows) only to have Wonder Woman take her head - which sparks war between the Amazons and the Atlantians.Dr. Thomas Wayne's Batman seems closer to the Batman originally envisioned by Bob Kane back in the first days of the comics where Batman did carry guns.  The edge of Dr. Thomas Wayne drinking throughout (presumably due to the loss of his son and wife) gives a bit of a humanity of a doctor turned casino owner, but that's about it.Cyborg serves as this world's version of &#34;Superman&#34; since Barry's action also resulted in Clark's ship crash-landing in Metropolis and the government locking him up in a vault under lights that replicate the spectrum of light from a red sun.  Batman even goes so far as to refer to Cyborg as a &#34;metal boyscout&#34;.All is finally made right by Batman killing Thawn (the evil version of Barry Allen) so that Barry Allen can time travel and stop himself from going back in time to stop his mother's murder.Once you get through the credits, you get a tease for Justice League: War.

The Amazons and the Atlanteans are at war with each over, due to Wonder Woman killing Queen Mera.

It's as good as any episode of Justice League Unlimited. You should be cautious, because it is very bloody. Don't let the kids see this one. It's based off the Graphic NovelFlashpointby Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert. Unlike previous adaptations, they didn't try to imitate the art by Andy Kubert, instead they used the ""house style"" from Studio 4C, the Japanese Animation Studio responsible (most recently) for the Berserk movies. You can see it in the bits of CGI throughout the film. It looks fantastic, and you can also spot all sorts of character models carried over from Young Justice.Seriously, let me reiterate, don't let kids watch this because no one is ""safe.""If I can say one thing, that is I really like Cyborg in this. Previously, Cyborg's inclusion really felt like a token gesture. This movie, I feel, really legitimizes his inclusion in the Justice League. But, besides that, it really is a Flash centric story. We get so few movies that don't focus on Superman or Batman, hopefully this will prove that other heroes can carry films. I really love this movie.Extras on the Bluray includeAudio Commentary with the Writer (Jim Kreig), Director (Jay Olivia), Producer (James Tucker), and the original author of the comic (Geoff Johns). I loved this commentary track.A Flash in Time - A short featurette about the possibility of time travel. Honestly, it's not that informative. That's what happens when you try to explain theoretical physics in layman's terms. It's 20 minutes I'll never get back.My Favorite Villain! The Flash Bad Guys - a 20-minutes look at the Flash's Rogues with Geoff Johns.Four episodes: ""Flash and Substance"" featuring the Rogues from Justice League Unlimited, ""Legends"" parts 1&2 from Justice League, which is about alternate dimensions, and ""Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster"" from Batman the Brave and the Bold featuring the three people to use the name the Flash.And a Sneak Peak at Justice League War, a reboot of the Justice League.Trailers and a digital comic pad out the disk.If you love Justice League, you'll love this movie.

1646301,A205BECZCE6DAU,B00CENSU1W,"Dennis M. Roy ""animation addict""","[9, 132]","Please note, this is written before the actual product is released.Some of the previous adaptations of DC Comics have failed to capture the epic quality of the series they were based on, but I'm hoping that this adaptation actually takes some liberties with the original Flashpoint event (quite honestly, the only thing worth reading now from that event was the 3-issue Batman spinoff miniseries by Brian Azzarello and Eduardo Risso - which would have been a fine ""Elseworlds"" Batman story, if adapted all by itself). If they can streamline the story and focus mainly on just Flash and Batman (with the Atlantean-Amazon war used as background) and throw in a dozen small cameo appearances by other (altered) DC heroes, I think it could work out. The problem with the original event is it just went off on too many tangents irrelevant to the main plotline featuring Flash and Batman, so maybe by paring the story down to its core essentials, the DC animation staff can actually improve on the original comic books. Here's hoping. I will later adjust my star rating up or down to reflect the final product's merits or lack thereof.EDIT 08/02/13 (THE ACTUAL REVIEW) - Well, I have now seen it, and have to say I was not much impressed. The darkness and violence wasn't an issue, since I was expecting that. Unfortunately the director, Jay Oliva, did NOT streamline the comic book plot to make it more comprehensible and focused. There was no need to show characters such as Deathstroke, Grifter, Canterbury Cricket, Etrigan, and a half-dozen others as they added absolutely nothing to the story. The story should have focused on Flash and Batman/Thomas Wayne, with the Atlantean/Amazon War as the backdrop. Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and to a lesser extent Cyborg, Superman, and Captain Atom were all necessary characters that moved the plot forward, and of course Reverse-Flash was crucial. But they could have dispensed with the others. It accurately reflects the comic series in that it is too rambling and unfocused for the viewer to much care about what is happening beyond some visceral scenes of massive destruction and the deaths of some formerly-familiar characters.More than anything though, this is an ugly looking production. The animation itself varies from excellent in some scenes to just barely passable in others. But what really killed it for me was the character designs themselves. I'm not talking about the parallel-earth versions of familiar characters, but how the animators chose to draw them - the style, for lack of a better term. Overly tall characters with small heads (or heads with tiny craniums) and bull necks. In short, to varying degrees, the heroes all look ugly, and the women homely (or at best, unattractive, when I'm sure the intention IS for them to be attractive). It's a far cry from the classic days of Bruce Timm/Lynne Naylor character design at WB for the DC characters.The real shame here is that Flash deserved a better starring vehicle for his turn in the animated spotlight. Given that it seems Geoff Johns is now the go-to source for original animated movie adaptations (Superman Unbound, Flashpoint Paradox, and the upcoming Justice League: WAR are all based on his stories), the Flash would have been far better served by adapting another Johns miniseries,The Flash: Rebirth.It seems that WB is now committed to moving forward into the ""New 52 Universe"" phase of DC Comics, and with that, I'm probably done with the animated adaptations. Bet all those excessive seams and lines that Jim Lee felt needed to be added to all the redesigned DC heroes' costumes prove difficult to animate.",3,2+1/2 stars - Could have been better.,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,3629,"['Please', 'note', 'written', 'actual', 'product', 'released.Some', 'previous', 'adaptations', 'DC', 'Comics', 'have', 'failed', 'capture', 'epic', 'quality', 'series', 'were', 'based', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'adaptation', 'actually', 'liberties', 'original', 'Flashpoint', 'event', 'quite', 'honestly', 'only', 'thing', 'reading', 'now', 'event', 'was', '3-issue', 'Batman', 'spinoff', 'miniseries', 'Brian', 'Azzarello', 'Eduardo', 'Risso', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'Elseworlds', 'Batman', 'story', 'adapted', 'can', 'streamline', 'story', 'focus', 'mainly', 'just', 'Flash', 'Batman', 'Atlantean-Amazon', 'war', 'used', 'background', 'throw', 'dozen', 'small', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'other', 'altered', 'DC', 'heroes', 'think', 'could', 'work', 'out', 'problem', 'original', 'event', 'just', 'went', 'off', 'too', 'many', 'tangents', 'irrelevant', 'main', 'plotline', 'featuring', 'Flash', 'Batman', 'maybe', 'paring', 'story', 'down', 'core', 'essentials', 'DC', 'animation', 'staff', 'can', 'actually', 'improve', 'original', 'comic', 'books', 'Here', 'hoping', 'will', 'later', 'adjust', 'star', 'rating', 'up', 'down', 'reflect', 'final', 'product', 'merits', 'lack', 'thereof.EDIT', '08/02/13', 'THE', 'ACTUAL', 'REVIEW', 'Well', 'have', 'now', 'seen', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'impressed', 'darkness', 'violence', 'was', ""n't"", 'issue', 'was', 'expecting', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'Jay', 'Oliva', 'did', 'NOT', 'streamline', 'comic', 'book', 'plot', 'make', 'more', 'comprehensible', 'focused', 'was', 'need', 'show', 'characters', 'such', 'Deathstroke', 'Grifter', 'Canterbury', 'Cricket', 'Etrigan', 'half-dozen', 'others', 'added', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'story', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'focused', 'Flash', 'Batman/Thomas', 'Wayne', 'Atlantean/Amazon', 'War', 'backdrop', 'Aquaman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Cyborg', 'Superman', 'Captain', 'Atom', 'were', 'necessary', 'characters', 'moved', 'plot', 'forward', 'course', 'Reverse-Flash', 'was', 'crucial', 'could', 'have', 'dispensed', 'others', 'accurately', 'comic', 'series', 'too', 'rambling', 'unfocused', 'viewer', 'much', 'care', 'what', 'happening', 'visceral', 'scenes', 'massive', 'destruction', 'deaths', 'formerly-familiar', 'characters.More', 'anything', 'ugly', 'looking', 'production', 'animation', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'just', 'barely', 'passable', 'others', 'what', 'really', 'killed', 'was', 'character', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'parallel-earth', 'versions', 'familiar', 'characters', 'how', 'animators', 'chose', 'draw', 'style', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'Overly', 'tall', 'characters', 'small', 'heads', 'heads', 'tiny', 'craniums', 'bull', 'necks', 'short', 'varying', 'degrees', 'heroes', 'look', 'ugly', 'women', 'homely', 'best', 'unattractive', 'when', ""'m"", 'sure', 'intention', 'IS', 'be', 'attractive', 'far', 'cry', 'classic', 'days', 'Bruce', 'Timm/Lynne', 'Naylor', 'character', 'design', 'WB', 'DC', 'characters.The', 'real', 'shame', 'here', 'Flash', 'deserved', 'better', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'turn', 'animated', 'spotlight', 'Given', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'now', 'go-to', 'source', 'original', 'animated', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'Superman', 'Unbound', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'upcoming', 'Justice', 'League', 'WAR', 'are', 'based', 'stories', 'Flash', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'served', 'adapting', 'Johns', 'miniseries', 'Flash', 'Rebirth.It', 'WB', 'now', 'committed', 'moving', 'forward', 'New', '52', 'Universe', 'phase', 'DC', 'Comics', ""'m"", 'probably', 'done', 'animated', 'adaptations', 'Bet', 'excessive', 'seams', 'lines', 'Jim', 'Lee', 'felt', 'needed', 'be', 'added', 'redesigned', 'DC', 'heroes', 'costumes', 'prove', 'difficult', 'animate']",DCU:Justice League:Flashpoint Paradox

Manning ""Sphinkler Bumcrot""","[0, 0]","&#34;Flashpoint&#34; is enjoyable from several angles, one being that you only need to know enough about the characters to understand how horribly things go wrong. We all know Batman's origin, for example, but here, it takes a painful sideways turn. That one basic type of point about most of the players is plenty, which helps both the new viewers and the fans. To a large extent, this is easily followed as a separate drama that transcends its superhero aspects. Those who are normally not an audience for such fare can still enjoy it.The violence and peril are really over the top here. You might be wary of showing it to younger kids, 'cause Super-Friends its NOT! We're talking impalements, disintegration and detached limbs. Be prepared. Geoff Johns is one hell of a writer, putting everyone through gymnastic contortions. I'd love to wax on about various points, but spoilers are needless. Just watch it. Its virtually everything good in our world turned upside-down and the pace is excellent.I think its also a wise move to elevate The Flash in general. He's the one member of the Justice League who is actually light-hearted. That balance is sorely needed in a pantheon of what are basically dour Roman/Greek gods, with many of their bad habits intact. One thing well-shown in &#34;Flashpoint&#34; is that he IS a rational police detective with his jaw set hard to do things in a rightful manner. He and Batman have a sympathetic common point in having lost family members to crime and its interesting to see how each copes. Batman goes dark; the Flash goes through and around. I was surprised at how engaging &#34;Flashpoint&#34; really was.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","With as long as many of these DC characters have been around, I would imagine that some writers and illustrators certainly have their work cut out for themselves when it comes to crafting a tale that&#8217;s both fresh and innovative as well as respectful to much of what&#8217;s come before in the pages.  Reading audiences are constantly in flux, dropping off when some new creative teams don&#8217;t prove to have the right stuff and then jumping aboard again when a particular fan-favorite starts crafting all new adventures.  THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX represents a highwater mark in adapting a great comic book tale &#8211; it serves up something brand new but with plenty of hints to what&#8217;s come before, and it does so in a way that&#8217;ll likely bring new readers to the books if (and only if) the personnel can deliver such big ideas to classic characters.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)We&#8217;ve all been there, wishing we could&#8217;ve done something differently.  Which of us hasn&#8217;t wanted a chance to go back into the past if only to tweak some singular small event in order to offer us a greater chance at happiness in the present or the future?  The loss of a loved one cuts deeply enough to leave a scar that&#8217;ll last a lifetime, and that&#8217;s what Barry Allen decides he wants to fix about his past: he wants to be there to stop his mother from dying at the hands of some cruel assailant.  Because he&#8217;s The Flash &#8211; because he has the ability to maneuver in and out of the time stream &#8211; he decides to do just that &#8230; and, little did he know, he tears apart the very fabric of the DC Universe!This is a brilliant tale, the kind of which didn&#8217;t used to exist when I started reading the monthlies back in the 1970&#8217;s.  Why?  Well, it&#8217;s necessarily dark, and it&#8217;s quite darker than most of the usual fare I&#8217;ve read in The Flash&#8217;s books.  In part, that&#8217;s because the greater entity &#8211; DC Comics &#8211; wanted to use this tale as a dramatic springboard with which to reboot their entire catalogue of heroes, villains, and superheroes.  In case you haven&#8217;t heard of it, DC rebooted its various worlds in 2012; while its may&#8217;ve been a source of new life for some books, I haven&#8217;t seen the rewards in others.That story &#8211; FLASHPOINT &#8211; has now been adapted by the ongoing DC Universe Animated Original Movie lines, and &#8211; so far as this critic is concerned &#8211; they&#8217;ve done it justice.  All of the adult themes are there (mark my words: this is probably NOT one for the kids due to the heavy nature of violence and torture throughout), and, despite serving up the usual &#8216;slightly better than Saturday morning fare&#8217; animation this one is draped in glorious somber tones and hues.Still, there are some pieces of the overall story that don&#8217;t &#8216;mesh&#8217; as well as they could, and I think that&#8217;s largely because this is essentially an 80-minute feature.  The time needed to plot out all of this so that it made perfect sense to newcomers would probably be more like an animated miniseries &#8211; suffice it to say, there&#8217;s a world war going on, but it&#8217;s primarily being waged by fallen superheroes and the minions they command; and, despite it being front-and-center in the conclusion, it really gets short shrift in the first half.  It gets introduced briskly with The Flash&#8217;s memories being changed so that he better understands this new universe he&#8217;s found himself a part of, and I think it could&#8217;ve been handled better than what we get here.Time travel stories are pretty universal &#8211; even folks who don&#8217;t much care for sci-fi narratives tend to enjoy a good time-travel-yarn &#8211; so THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX is most definitely worth a view even by those who aren&#8217;t drawn to comic book properties.  There&#8217;s enough in here that gives the story greater depth as well (i.e. Barry&#8217;s desire to see his mom alive again; Thomas Wayne&#8217;s desire to give his son a second chance at life; Wonder Woman&#8217;s wishes to be free of a marriage she doesn&#8217;t want, etc.), and I think that there&#8217;s probably something for everyone.But &#8211; and I&#8217;m only harping on this because I think it&#8217;s a realistic observation &#8211; this is NOT for kids.  It&#8217;s pretty grim.  It&#8217;s a very dark tale.  There&#8217;s an awful lot of violence, and it isn&#8217;t the usual comic-book-style; it&#8217;s graphic and at time disturbing &#8230; such as what happens to Barry Allen in this world when he tries to recreate the accident that made him who he was in the original world.  It&#8217;s rated PG-13, and I think even that&#8217;s mildly questionable in a few instances.  So consider yourself warned.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Everything about this JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX is superior, from the voice direction, the animation style, right down to the thematic elements.  This is miles and miles better than practically anything else being done in the direct-to-DVD market, and it&#8217;s the kind of story that probably appeals to old and new fans of DC&#8217;s titles alike.  I will say &#8211; and I stress this very emphatically &#8211; this is NOT a tale for children as some of the other DC flicks have been; the subject matter is necessarily dark and grim, and the level of corresponding violence is indeed quite high.  For mature comic&#8217;s fans like myself, this is a home run.",5,"This Is A Brilliant Adaptation, and It's My Personal Favorite Of All The DC Universe Movies Thus Far",1395705600,"03 25,

THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX tells the tale of theFlashpointmini-series that (sadly) forever changed DC Comics.  The star of the movie is The Flash (the Barry Allen version).  Something in his past is altered, leading to a whole different future for not only him, but the entire world.  It was a well-told story in this animated movie, and even ended on an emotional note, which actually moved me a bit.  I'm glad I read the original series, though, because there were some parts missing from the movie that I felt were integral to the storyline.There were a lot of DC characters throughout (yay!), but if you're unfamiliar with them (or the Flashpoint storyline), you'd probably have no clue who they are.  The movie didn't bother to name particular characters for the audience.  For example, Deathstroke and Black Manta appeared in the movie, but their names were never mentioned (that I noticed).  If you didn't know them already, you certainly wouldn't know them by watching the movie.  There were lots of extra superheroes that appeared in the movie, but where was Booster Gold, who was an important character in the original comic book series?The animation was pretty good overall; however, what I didn't like was the faces of the characters.  They were all drawn in anime/manga, Pokemon-like style. UGH.  Wonder Woman and a young Barry Allen with those big eyes and weird-shaped pointy chin?  Was that really necessary?  Luckily, you only noticed it in the close-up shots, but it felt a bit jarring with the rest of the animation.As another reviewer pointed out, there is a LOT of violence in this movie.  After all, it is an apocalyptic movie set on an alternate world, so anything can happen...and does.  It's no different from any other PG-13 apocalyptic movie, though, except that it's animated.  But there are some violent scenes that take place off camera; you know what's happening, but you don't actually see what's being done.This is definitely one of the best DC animated movies, and is a must-see for any superhero/comic book fan.  It's kind of funny that they didn't just call it ""Flashpoint"" like the comic series.  Adding ""Paradox"" to the end reminded me of aBig Bang Theoryepisode.p.s.

1646323,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00CENSU1W,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[3, 3]","DC Comics definitely hits its stride with ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox."" Never have I been more impressed with an animated adaptation of a comic book story arc than I am with this spectacular straight-to-DVD movie. At the same time, I am not without complaints in regards to it.Everyone wishes they could go back in time and right the wrongs they or others have committed. The Flash (Justin Chambers) is no different... and he has the power to do so! Unfortunately, his selfish desires to bring his mother back from the dead causes a ripple in the time stream which looks to cause the destruction of the entire world at the hands of Aquaman (Cary Elwes) and Wonder Woman (Vanessa Marshall).The two super heroes are at war with each other in this skewed reality. They could cause the outbreak of World War III and the deaths of millions of innocent people. Can the Flash and the alternate versions of the Justice League band together and keep the Atlantean and Amazonian warriors from destroying the entire world in their vengeful crusade?The animation style of ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" is very much unique to what we've seen before from the DC animated features. Something about it just gives the entire movie a bigger and more epic feel than what we've experienced in the past. Like me, some might find the new artistic renditions of their favorite super heroes off-putting at first. As the film moves on, I found myself embracing and crediting the style change with giving it an extra dimension and setting it apart as something distinct.Writer Jim Krieg does everything he possibly can to bring Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert's graphic novel to life for the big or small screen. He successfully pulls in all the necessary elements from the book to give it a solid foundation and keep it moving forward at a breakneck pace. ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" begins to unravel when he tries to fit too many extraneous Easter eggs and backstories from the individual books published outside of the main graphic novel into 81 minutes.Krieg takes the source material from ""The World of Flashpoint: Batman,"" The World of Flashpoint: Superman,"" and ""The World of Flashpoint: Green Lantern"" and tries to add too much depth to the alternate universe storylines of these characters. He ends up making the movie feel like it's about to burst at the seams. Krieg does do a good job fleshing out the Aquaman and Wonder Woman conflict which acts as the backdrop of the tale.""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" looks and sounds phenomenal. It's presented in 1080p High Definition (1.78:1). The colors are vibrant the way a movie based on a comic book should be and the picture is crystal clear. A 5.1 surround sound mix brings to life the climactic battles and bombastic musical score, assuring home audiences will be absorbed by the film.The Blu-ray is stuffed full of exclusive content. Writer Geoff Johns, Producer James Tucker, Screenwriter Jim Krieg, and Director Jay Oliva provide feature commentary. Two featurettes are included entitled ""My Favorite Villain! The Flash Bad Guys"" and ""A Flash in Time."" It contains an excerpt from the digital Flashpoint #1 comic. Four bonus cartoons are pulled out of the DC Comics vault as well. We also get a sneak peek at the upcoming ""Justice League: War"" animated movie.""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" is definitely rated PG-13. There's a lot of violence, some being very graphic. There's also adult language and situations. As usual, some of the female characters barely wear any clothes. The artists of the film also enjoy drawing Wonder Woman's butt bursting out of her costume.Although it has its problems, I consider ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" to be a big step forward for the DC animated features. It kept my attention through great storytelling, extraordinary battle sequences, and a legendary face-off between Aquaman and Wonder Woman. Flash fans will find the movie to be everything they've ever wanted as their favorite character takes front and center.",4,"""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" Takes DC Animated Features to the Next Level",1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,4056,"['DC', 'Comics', 'definitely', 'stride', 'Justice', 'League', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'Never', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'impressed', 'animated', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'am', 'spectacular', 'straight-to-DVD', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'am', 'not', 'complaints', 'regards', 'it.Everyone', 'wishes', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'right', 'wrongs', 'others', 'have', 'committed', 'Flash', 'Justin', 'Chambers', 'different', 'power', 'do', 'so', 'Unfortunately', 'selfish', 'desires', 'bring', 'mother', 'back', 'dead', 'ripple', 'time', 'stream', 'cause', 'destruction', 'entire', 'world', 'hands', 'Aquaman', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Vanessa', 'Marshall', '.The', 'two', 'super', 'heroes', 'are', 'war', 'other', 'skewed', 'reality', 'could', 'cause', 'outbreak', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'deaths', 'millions', 'innocent', 'people', 'Can', 'Flash', 'alternate', 'versions', 'Justice', 'League', 'band', 'together', 'keep', 'Atlantean', 'Amazonian', 'warriors', 'destroying', 'entire', 'world', 'vengeful', 'crusade', 'animation', 'style', 'Justice', 'League', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'very', 'much', 'unique', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DC', 'animated', 'features', 'Something', 'just', 'entire', 'movie', 'bigger', 'more', 'epic', 'feel', 'what', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'past', 'might', 'find', 'new', 'artistic', 'renditions', 'favorite', 'super', 'heroes', 'off-putting', 'first', 'film', 'moves', 'found', 'embracing', 'crediting', 'style', 'change', 'giving', 'extra', 'dimension', 'setting', 'apart', 'something', 'distinct.Writer', 'Jim', 'Krieg', 'everything', 'possibly', 'can', 'bring', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'Andy', 'Kubert', 'graphic', 'novel', 'life', 'big', 'small', 'screen', 'successfully', 'necessary', 'elements', 'book', 'give', 'solid', 'foundation', 'keep', 'moving', 'forward', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'Justice', 'League', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'unravel', 'when', 'fit', 'too', 'many', 'extraneous', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'backstories', 'individual', 'books', 'published', 'main', 'graphic', 'novel', '81', 'minutes.Krieg', 'source', 'material', 'World', 'Flashpoint', 'Batman', 'World', 'Flashpoint', 'Superman', 'World', 'Flashpoint', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'tries', 'add', 'too', 'much', 'depth', 'alternate', 'universe', 'storylines', 'characters', 'up', 'making', 'movie', 'feel', 'burst', 'seams', 'Krieg', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'Aquaman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'conflict', 'backdrop', 'tale', 'Justice', 'League', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'phenomenal', 'presented', '1080p', 'High', 'Definition', '1.78:1', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'way', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'should', 'be', 'picture', 'crystal', 'clear', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'mix', 'brings', 'life', 'climactic', 'battles', 'bombastic', 'musical', 'score', 'assuring', 'home', 'audiences', 'will', 'be', 'absorbed', 'film.The', 'Blu-ray', 'stuffed', 'full', 'exclusive', 'content', 'Writer', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'Producer', 'James', 'Tucker', 'Screenwriter', 'Jim', 'Krieg', 'Director', 'Jay', 'Oliva', 'provide', 'feature', 'commentary', 'Two', 'featurettes', 'are', 'included', 'entitled', 'Favorite', 'Villain', 'Flash', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'Flash', 'Time', 'excerpt', 'digital', 'Flashpoint', '1', 'comic', 'Four', 'bonus', 'cartoons', 'are', 'pulled', 'DC', 'Comics', 'vault', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'get', 'sneak', 'peek', 'upcoming', 'Justice', 'League', 'War', 'animated', 'movie', 'Justice', 'League', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'definitely', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'lot', 'violence', 'being', 'very', 'graphic', 'also', 'adult', 'language', 'situations', 'usual', 'female', 'characters', 'barely', 'wear', 'clothes', 'artists', 'film', 'also', 'enjoy', 'drawing', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'butt', 'bursting', 'costume.Although', 'problems', 'consider', 'Justice', 'League', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'be', 'big', 'step', 'forward', 'DC', 'animated', 'features', 'kept', 'attention', 'great', 'storytelling', 'extraordinary', 'battle', 'sequences', 'legendary', 'face-off', 'Aquaman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Flash', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wanted', 'favorite', 'character', 'front', 'center']",DCU:Justice League:Flashpoint Paradox
1646324,A3I9UPX8UYFB5L,B00CENSU1W,Exchronos,"[2, 4]","SPOILERS! Also, this is NOT a kid friendly movie!First off, I want to say that I was very hyped for this film. I prefer DC alternate reality stories, and it was ""Flashpoint"" that got me back into reading comics on a regular basis.So, why am I only giving this two stars? Because if I hadn't read the comics at first, I would've had no clue what was going on by just watching the film. I mean, there really doesn't seem to be any transition from the Old DC Universe to the Flashpoint Universe, the way it's edited really seems like a plot hole. It does effectively convey that we learn what's happened alongside the Flash, but it really seems like a scene was skipped there, it goes from normal to him waking up at his desk at work and everything's changed! Although, in hindsight I guess revealing how the alternate universe occurs pretty much tells the end of the film, but maybe that montage of changed events playing over him sleeping at the desk would've been less awkward in the story telling aspect.About mid-way into the film we get a montage of sorts of the changes in events that led to the current state of the Flashpoint Universe but it just comes out of nowhere telling us what happened to Superman, Batman, and Aquaman and Wonder Woman. Really, I believe the film could have been edited better to make it easier to follow as a story rather than a jumble that I was really only able to make sense of because I had read the entire comics series.That being said, they made a lot of changes to the story from the comics as well. Now please understand that I do understand that they need to make some changes for cinematic purposes, but they completely changed the reason why the Amazons VS Atlanteans War was started! In the film the reason is Mera tries to kill Wonder Woman for sleeping with Aquaman and then Wonder Woman kills Queen Mera of Atlantis thus starting the war. In the comics Aquaman and Wonder Woman were going to marry as a political wedding combining Themyscira and Atlantis, but a conspiracy from both sides decides to destroy the wedding by framing Garth (the original Aqualad) as the assassin of Queen Hippolyta, Wonder Woman's mother. Wonder Woman kills Mera much later on though in the comics. Now, to me, that's a huge change from the source material. Other things are trivial like Abin Sur still being dead but Hal not being the Green Lantern (in the comics Hal wasn't the Green Lantern because Abin Sur was still alive and helping Cyborg), or Captain Atom being there (in the comics Captain Nathaniel Adams never became Captain Atom, and the Atlantean Destruction machine was powered by Geo-Force), and they never really mentioned that ""Citizen Cold"" is a hero, except for having him there as a hologram. We never really got to see Martha Wayne as the Joker, and they dropped Frankenstein and the Creature Commandos, Element Lady, and some other characters.I'll admit, the comics series itself was very expansive and surprisingly they did touch on a lot of the characters. I was surprised by their working in Deathstroke and the Resistance.If you've read the comics then this film is a cool companion film to watch. I think the sequencing of some of the film could've been handled a lot better so it'd flow better as a movie, and it could've been a bit more faithful to the comics.I think what it really comes down to is that you can't tell that expansive of a story and do it justice in 90 minutes. I mean, ""The Dark Knight Returns"" they broke down into two films but comics wise was less issues than what it they did for ""Flashpoint"".Sincerely,Exchronos",3,Read The Comics First,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,3589,"['SPOILERS', 'Also', 'NOT', 'kid', 'friendly', 'movie', 'First', 'want', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'hyped', 'film', 'prefer', 'DC', 'alternate', 'reality', 'stories', 'was', 'Flashpoint', 'got', 'back', 'reading', 'comics', 'regular', 'basis.So', 'why', 'am', 'only', 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'comics', 'first', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'just', 'watching', 'film', 'mean', 'really', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'transition', 'Old', 'DC', 'Universe', 'Flashpoint', 'Universe', 'way', 'edited', 'really', 'plot', 'hole', 'effectively', 'convey', 'learn', 'what', 'happened', 'Flash', 'really', 'scene', 'was', 'skipped', 'there', 'normal', 'waking', 'up', 'desk', 'work', 'everything', 'changed', 'hindsight', 'guess', 'revealing', 'how', 'alternate', 'universe', 'pretty', 'much', 'end', 'film', 'maybe', 'montage', 'changed', 'events', 'playing', 'sleeping', 'desk', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'less', 'awkward', 'story', 'telling', 'mid-way', 'film', 'get', 'montage', 'sorts', 'changes', 'events', 'led', 'current', 'state', 'Flashpoint', 'Universe', 'just', 'nowhere', 'telling', 'happened', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'Aquaman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Really', 'believe', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'better', 'make', 'easier', 'follow', 'story', 'rather', 'jumble', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'able', 'make', 'sense', 'had', 'read', 'entire', 'comics', 'series.That', 'being', 'said', 'made', 'lot', 'changes', 'story', 'comics', 'well', 'Now', 'please', 'understand', 'do', 'understand', 'need', 'make', 'changes', 'cinematic', 'purposes', 'completely', 'changed', 'reason', 'why', 'Amazons', 'VS', 'Atlanteans', 'War', 'was', 'started', 'film', 'reason', 'Mera', 'tries', 'kill', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'sleeping', 'Aquaman', 'then', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Queen', 'Mera', 'Atlantis', 'thus', 'starting', 'war', 'comics', 'Aquaman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'were', 'going', 'marry', 'political', 'wedding', 'combining', 'Themyscira', 'Atlantis', 'conspiracy', 'sides', 'decides', 'destroy', 'wedding', 'framing', 'Garth', 'original', 'Aqualad', 'assassin', 'Queen', 'Hippolyta', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'mother', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Mera', 'much', 'later', 'comics', 'Now', 'huge', 'change', 'source', 'material', 'Other', 'things', 'are', 'trivial', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'still', 'being', 'dead', 'Hal', 'not', 'being', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'comics', 'Hal', 'was', ""n't"", 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'helping', 'Cyborg', 'Captain', 'Atom', 'being', 'there', 'comics', 'Captain', 'Nathaniel', 'Adams', 'never', 'became', 'Captain', 'Atom', 'Atlantean', 'Destruction', 'machine', 'was', 'powered', 'Geo-Force', 'never', 'really', 'mentioned', 'Citizen', 'Cold', 'hero', 'having', 'there', 'hologram', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'see', 'Martha', 'Wayne', 'Joker', 'dropped', 'Frankenstein', 'Creature', 'Commandos', 'Element', 'Lady', 'other', 'characters.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'comics', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'expansive', 'surprisingly', 'did', 'touch', 'lot', 'characters', 'was', 'surprised', 'working', 'Deathstroke', 'Resistance.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'comics', 'then', 'film', 'cool', 'companion', 'film', 'watch', 'think', 'sequencing', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'handled', 'lot', 'better', ""'d"", 'flow', 'better', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'faithful', 'comics.I', 'think', 'what', 'really', 'down', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'expansive', 'story', 'do', 'justice', '90', 'minutes', 'mean', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'broke', 'down', 'two', 'films', 'comics', 'wise', 'was', 'less', 'issues', 'what', 'did', 'Flashpoint', '.Sincerely', 'Exchronos']",DCU:Justice League:Flashpoint Paradox

And it happened four more times including a kid saying a word. Then violent killings were shown, including the death of child which went way too farin a movie that stars characters largely marketed to kids. Contrary to popular belief, neither of those elements are really necessary to make an animated movie more real. And though I'm a long time fan and supporter of DC product, I don't have to like every movie or show they make. There were moments I liked such as the multiple cameos including both Aqualads, Manta, Captain Atom, Captain Marvel and others. The different takes on both Superman and Batman were really good. And they finally got Lois Lane's look and voice right. Wonder Woman, not so much, looking like Celine Dion. It was super great that someone other than Batman and Superman was the star of a Justice League movie.

1646327,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00CENSU1W,FNDNreview,"[0, 0]","If you ask a group of comic book fans about their all-time favorite storyline, several will answer with one of the many futuristic/alternate reality tales that have taken place over the years.  Instantly, Days of Future Past sticks out as one of the cornerstone stories (from Marvel's X-Men universe) in which sentinels are in charge of a desolate future, due to an assassination that sends the future of civilization into a tailspin of horrors.  Now, there have been numerous alternate reality stories over the years, but perhaps none more important to a company than DC's 2011 Flashpoint storyline - a miniseries that's responsible for transitioning to DC's NEW 52 universe.  The status quo changes heavily after the events of the Flashpoint series, essentially allowing DC to ""freshen up"" their brand for the future (costumes, character origin updates, etc.) - but we're getting ahead of ourselves.  Before DC Animation adopts the NEW 52 brand, their newest animation interpretation brings the events for Flashpoint to life in the original animated movie, The Flashpoint Paradox.Directed by Jay Oliva (Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 & 2), The Flashpoint Paradox begins with Barry Allen aka The Flash (voiced by Justin Chambers) visiting his mother's grave.  As part of an ambush, The Flash is attached by several villains from his rogues gallery, including Captain Boomerang, Captain Cold, and Eobard Thawne aka Professor Zoom/Reverse Flash (C. Thomas Howell).  With the assistance of his fellow Justice League members, Flash is able to defeat the villains.  However, when he awakens the following morning, the world has changed.  Barry's mother is alive, Bruce Wayne is dead, and the world is at war with Atlanteans and Amazons, which includes Aquaman and Wonder Woman.  Not only are Aquaman (Cary Elwes) and Wonder Woman (Vanessa Marshall) villains to the world - no one has ever heard of Superman.  Desperate to make the world right, Barry enlists the help of the alternate future's Batman (Kevin McKidd) and Cyborg (Michael B. Jordan) in order to discover the reason for the timeline's change and help him set things right.  The voices of Nathan Fillion, Dana Delany, Sam Daly, and Kevin Conroy also star in supporting roles.While members of the Justice League are present throughout the course of this film, make no mistake about it - this film focuses solely on The Flash.  Over the course of DC's animation history, The Flash has been pretty heavily overlooked in comparison to Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman.  Finally, The Flash has a standalone story where he has the focus set squarely on him and his talents are utilized to their fullest.  Typically voiced by Charlie Schlatter or Michael Rosenbaum, The Flash is voiced by Grey's Anatomy star Justin Chambers in this film.  Although it doesn't necessarily seem like a natural fit, Chambers pulls off the charismatic charm of Barry Allen with sheer brilliance and never misses a beat - so much so that it's a bit of a disappointment to have already learned that he won't be reprising his role as The Flash in the next Justice League animated film.Originally, the comic book version of Flashpoint was overshadowed by the fact that DC was rebooting their entire universe.  Many people still overlook the fact that Flashpoint stands on its own pretty well on the list of good - bordering on great - alternate reality stories.  The story takes a dark tone, and does so in such a clever, innocent manner.  This is by far the darkest DC animated film yet, which is clearly evident in the actions of some of DC's most beloved heroes.  The Flashpoint Paradox a window into the lives of their superheroes, depicting them as near bipolar opposites from the characters we all know and love.  The film serves as a vision of what can happen when something so innocent is changed.  If there's one theme to be taken away from this film, it should be the importance of selfishness vs. selflessness.  You'll understand when get to the epic climax scene.Even though this is The Flash's film to shine, he is a bit overshadowed in certain scenes by the newer, edgier alternate version of Batman.  If you don't have any knowledge about this story, there's no need to spoil the identity of Batman for you, other than to say it's not Bruce Wayne.  This new version of Batman is reminiscent of Jason Todd's brief stint as Batman - carrying guns, not afraid to take a life, and without any shred of home for humanity.  This isn't the Batman that we all know and love, but it's an amazing and interesting change of pace that almost deserves a few more future stories of his own.  Kevin McKidd does an impressive job, continuing the trend of making Batman sound cryptic and no doubt terrifying to those pesky criminals.  While we're on the subject of Batman, it's implied that he has been battling a different version of The Joker.  And, to be honest, it's a pretty interesting notion.  Sadly, this element of Batman's alternate history is only explored for a brief moment.Overall, there's no doubt this is one of the best DC animated films to date.  It's pure comic book/superhero action at its finest, with a solid storyline, enjoyable anime-style animation, and some pretty notable voice work.  However, it should be noted this film is not for children.  Even though it's a cartoon, there's still some pretty brutal imagery taking place over the course of the film - so much so that this film definitely earns its PG-13 rating.  On the flip side and as far as adult comic book fans are concerned, this film is one of the better animated films, which fits in nicely with the popular Batman: Mask of the Phantasm or Batman: Under the Red Hood films.  It's clear that DC has another hit on their hands with this animated flick, which will lead in nicely to the launch of the NEW 52 animated films, beginning with Justice League: War - hitting

1646333,A3CUQFH84HBTY0,B00CENSU1W,Gabe,"[7, 10]","[The first thing to say is that this is not a movie for children. The content includes a great deal of violence, including a home invasion that ends in murder, a hanging, and the off-screen killing of a child. This is in addition to many bloody battle scenes where people are shot and injured.]Overall, I would say that this is one of the more engaging animated movies that DC has released over the past couple of years, in that the concept of the original comic lends itself better to a short animated feature, much more than nuanced works like ""The Dark Knight Returns"" or shallow ones as ""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"". Because a good portion of the movie is set in an alternative universe, unambiguously heroic characters now take unpredicable actions and form previously unlikely allegiances. The voice acting, as usual, is good, and Sam Daly did a better than expected job of filling in for his father as Superman, and will presumably be used as the voice of the ""New 52"" Superman, but I hope that DC will continue to use Tim Daly when making movies with (Classic) Superman.As with many of these DC animated adaptations, you get a sense from the filmmakers that they're never sure whether they should slavishly keep every detail from the comic because there is some fan that expects it, or if they should really rework it as a story for maximum emotional impact in the 80 minute running time. A mistake given the limited screen time was that not enough time was spent focusing on Flash's new relationship with his mother, who he changed time and doomed the world to be with. A giant worldwide war sounds grandiose but a viewer can connect much more viscerally with a character who has a more intimate tragedy like accepting that he has to let his mother die.There were many ancillary elements in the story that never went anywhere and were only included because they were in the comic. Elements such as:* Superman. It's been made clear in many stories that Superman is the inspiration for the other heroes and the glue that holds the DC Universe together. In this movie, a good portion of time is spent finding what happened to Kal-El; the assumption being that he can stop the war. He is found and runs away, only to reappear at the end of the movie with no impact on the events in the story. The subplot served no purpose, it would have been better just to have had his spacecraft destroyed on impact, further implying that the alternative timeline is a broken world that cannot be fixed.*Joker. While the idea that there must always be a tragedy that creates Batman is intriguing, shoehorning the Joker into this doesn't works, because he is such a singular entity, and the mantle cannot be taken up by just anyone, let alone Martha Wayne. The setup of Martha Wayne as Joker was absurd, did not go anywhere and could have been dropped from the movie altogether.Unfortunately with some of these DC animated movies, because there's such a rush to get them out, not as much attention is given to giving the character designs a proper feel and look, and by default the animators tend to draw in a more anime style. This was apparent in ""Superman vs the Elite"", and is the case in ""The Flashpoint Paradox"".Presumably, the ""Paradox"" that the title references is that in trying to save one person, Flash ravages the entire world.But as with all time travel movies, there are many paradoxes and questions that are never satisfactorily resolved when you stop and think about the movie:* If the existence of the Reverse-Flash prevents the Flash from going back in time and restoring the original timeline, how did Barry go back in the first place (since the Reverse-Flash clearly existed)?* If Barry changed time and never became the Flash, then there is a paradox - who is the one who will go back in time and save his mother from being killed? Also, if there is a new timeline where the Flash didn't exist, then how did Reverse Flash come to be in that timeline's future?* If the Flash changed the timeline and no one remembers the previous timeline (because it was changed around them), how can the Reverse-Flash remember the other timeline (he doesn't seem disoriented at all by the changes)?*(while not a paradox) - How did the Flashes escape from the (inescapable) adhesive?Aftereffects:Presumably after this movie, the DC animated universe will reflect the reality of the ""New 52"" DC comics reboot, with altered origins and costumes for many of the characters. Oddly enough, at the end of the movie Flash doesn't seem to notice or mention that his and Batman's costume has changed, even though the main plot of the movie is based on Flash being aware of differences between the realities that no one else perceives. Also, it will probably be the case that the characters will have no memory of the ""Flashpoint"" universe, and it's a missed opportunity to introduce a bit more depth into the decisions of the characters. How can: Aquaman lead when he knows inside himself is the capacity to destroy millions of people / Wonder Woman fight when she sees how far her warrior mentality can take her / Superman support the government that intended to keep him as a prisoner for all his life?Like I said at the beginning, overall it's one of the more engaging DC animated films... but I can't shake the feeling that all of this happened so they could get rid of Superman's trunks.",3,Pros and Cons and Paradoxes (Spoilers) *3.5 Stars,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,5378,"['[', 'first', 'thing', 'say', 'not', 'movie',

This is by far the best DC animated film that I have seen! If you are not familiar with the story-line arc in the comic, you may be confusing but I feel they explained the background of the characters well for the amount of time they were allowed. What surprised me the most about Flashpoint was the amount of violence (not that it bothered me) and was shocked to see popular DC characters die and how some of them died. I feel Flashpoint was well done and hope this movie opened a door to make a DC animated movie of the Blackest Night story arc. The story-line was excellent, the animation was outstanding, well developed main characters and it was able to make me feel emotionally attached to what was going on (ex: ""damn, that was messed up."" ""damn, that was pretty damn sad."" ""damn...he's crying.""). Do not get your expectations high based on my review (I mad that mistake going into the X-Men movie when it first came out), but please watch Flashpoint as I did, with an open mind.

1646342,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00CENSU1W,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 3]","If you haven't read the comic book source material by Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert, odds are your brow will furrow repeatedly at the shocking stuff that goes down in this animated adaptation. Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox runs 75 minutes, only it feels longer because it's packed with so many side stories. Some say too many side stories. Me, I liked it fine. I'm beaming that the Flash gets a chance to strut his stuff. I'm excited he's got a live action television series in development with the CW and that the 2013 Flash Annual is such a highlight read.Who knew Nora Allen, dead and mourned all these years, wielded such mighty impact on the DC universe? Her son, as you know, is Barry Allen, referred to even by Usain Bolt as the Fastest Man Alive. Barry Allen is usually a methodical, sensible sort. And yet, after years of foiling twisted miscreants and saving lives and once even dying for the cause, it's hard to begrudge him his one moment of selfishness.***Perhaps some plot SPOILERS from here on out***One day the Flash wakes up to find everything changed. In this new and terrifying world there is no Justice League, no Superman, not much hope. Earth teeters on the brink of annihilation. Swarming opposing armies commanded respectively by a demented Aquaman and a savage Wonder Woman have reduced to Europe to an apocalyptic theater of war. In this reality Barry Allen has no super-speed. His beloved Iris is happily married to someone else. And maybe the most earthquaking swerve surfaces when Barry runs into his mother, alive and well. It's the only good news he's found in this crap new existence. Barry Allen immediately works to realign reality. He approaches the most resourceful man he knows.They say lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place. No, it instead strikes it three times, if you go by Kid Flash's origin and by Barry's desperate restating of the lab accident that once had bestowed super-speed. I won't divulge the result. I'll only mention that if Barry were so inclined, he could've gone with a new superhero code name: ""Super-Crispy.""Regarding the source material, I wasn't too impressed with Johns and Kubert's Flashpoint arc. And, sure, maybe ire is based in part on bias. We all knew Flashpoint would be the catalyst to DC's New 52 initiative, and I was all kinds of cynical about what really brought about such a sweeping, company-wide change. Ugh. Anyway, I prefer the movie to the comic book.I saw it with friends who were conflicted. First point of contention: some protested that the animation leans too heavily towards anime and away from the style of the Bruce Timm cartoon era. I didn't fret over the animation, not even when I eyeballed several really severe character models (Aquaman, for one, looks truly crazed). It's as if Bart Sears' pencils had come to life, and I mean that as a good thing. There was grousing that character weight was sacrificed to favor multiple sub-plots. I disagree. I think the core players received strong character beats, none more resonant than the coda scene with Flash and Batman. This is a vehicle for the Flash, and yet the most memorable figure is the Flashpoint Batman. He's even more tortured than the regular continuity Bruce Wayne. One unanimous beef: to a man we wish Geoff Johns would quit it already trying to elevate Cyborg to top tier status. He's making me hate a character I used to really like when Wolfman was writing him. It's Sentry all over again. (Somewhere Brian Michael Bendis is going: ""Whatchu talking about?"")Piles of fun Easter eggs. Heaps of recalibrated origins and startling scenarios. A horde of characters relegated to cameos and given short shrift, and plenty of them viewed thru cracked mirrors. Ray Bradbury, wherever he is, is pleased as punch that he's obliquely referenced here: the butterfly effect is no joke, man! The changes are radical. It's rather brilliant that the movie opens with a fairly light sequence in which Flash and his Justice League buds thwart his rogues' gallery. It's breezy tone presents a stark contrast to the depths of brooding we're later exposed to. This movie is rated PG-13 and I'd even go as far as to say it's a hard PG-13. There are moments that jar with graphic brutality. Nathan Fillion briefly voices Hal Jordan and utters a naughty. It's not for the younger kids. I'm bothered some by that tiresome retread about writers getting their brave on only when they're playing in the sandbox of alternate realities, easily discounted territories wherein characters can be killed off with no real consequence. And having condemned the film for that, let me do a quick 180 and observe that the storytelling here is that much more intriguing for its darker and more mature - if not richer - themes. This is the most commanding and least Super Friend-y that  Aquaman has ever been. I do wish that the movie were longer. 75 minutes isn't near long enough to service a story of this sweep and ambition. Or maybe I just wanted more camera time for the Canterbury Cricket (never mind that his Flashpoint tie-in comic book was rubbish).Oh, and maybe you'd want to stay for the post-credits stinger.The bonus stuff on this Blu-Ray disc:- Audio Commentary by comic book writer Geoff Johns, director Jay Oliva, producer James Tucker, and screen writer Jim Krieg- ""A Flash in Time: Time Travel in the Flash Universe"" - a featurette that examines the concept of time travel and attempts to apply real science to the Flash's super-powers (00:22:24 minutes)- ""My Favorite Villain!

1646343,AE7SKYQFWYFIM,B00CENSU1W,Headphone Jack,"[2, 4]","Short version: DC trying to take The Flash in a darker direction.  The effort felt artificial, like there was some mandate that the next movie coming out have blood and death.  This movie is well-animated, loaded with great ideas and terrific possibility, but it mainly just dissolves into a rather flat, sci-fi superhero war.Almost no sexual content.===PROS===* Production Quality - Right off the bat, this was good animation and a quality production.  Action sequences were strong, art was interesting and well done.  A few moments felt choppy, but still a step forward for the DC animated movies.* No shortcuts.  Unlike many action titles, Flashpoint Paradox didn't cut for the sake of cutting, or have an extra long sequence with no movement; they cut it when it was time to move to the next scene.  So many action titles can't get this rhythm right.  It's either too slow, too fast, or becomes becomes disjointed.  This production definitely delivers where others hesitate or flutter, similar to another DC title ""Crisis on Two Earths"" though in a different way.* Excellent voice cast for The Flash.  I expected the always-pushing, punchline man from the Justice League series.  There, the Barry is cast as an entertaining representative of the short-attention span audience.  Instead, this movie offers a genuine hero with flaws and fears along side determination and strength.  Actor Justin Chambers struck the right tone here and deserves real credit.===CONS===* Dark and not in a way that other DC titles have taken a darker turn: this one was flimsy and forced.  It seemed like they had an already good story rewritten to fit the Christopher Nolan-inspired mold DC is trying to push into, rather than letting the story dictate it's own terms.  Dark is something the DC animation studios know how to do: ""Batman: Year One"" was a perfect example of how animation can tell a very human, very adult story.* Seriously dark.  Wonder Woman kills someone in the 3rd act and it just went too far.  Roll it back, DC.=== Unexplored characters ===Poor execution:- The mother and wife really felt unexplored where they needed to explain the personal, human element behind Flash's decisions.- Villain was flat and boring.  Just full of hate and bile for no reason.  His defeat was unsatisfying and gruesome.- No time was spent on the Athenians vs. Aqua Man bit.  I didn't understand at any point why they were in an all-out war.- Lots of meaningless, dull cameos that felt like they were checking off boxes of required superheros.  I think Joss Whedon called this phenomenon ""Easter Eggs"" in reference to characters from the Avengers showing up in the S.H.E.I.L.D. TV show.Missed opportunities:- Superman: in maybe the most interesting look at him I've yet seen, his appearance was slightly above cameo.- Green Lantern (from the very talented voice acting of Nathan Fillon and also did a good job on a recent Wonder Woman origin movie): appeared and quickly disappeared.- The Joker: again, utterly loaded with exciting possibility, and never got past the introduction.

1646351,A26O0T192IBKY1,B00CENSU1W,J. Alford,"[3, 3]","Probably the quickest direct from comics to video production by DC Universe, this came out less than two years after the original story arc. Flashpoint was one of those big crossover events in comics that usually effects all the main characters of a comics universe, but this also acted as a catalyst for restarting the entire DC Comics product line into what is now referred to at the New 52. Before this, the DC Universe was made up of several different ones, including the Wildstorm and some of the Vertigo titles. So, anyone interested in how DC's new product line started out, this is pretty much where to begin from. This was directed by Jay Olivia, whose prior work includes Young Justice and Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, as well as some of the previous DC Universe films, so you know he knows his superhero material. Plus, a large portion of the animation was handled by Studio 4C, the anime studio who have also done production on Memories, the new Thundecats series, and the Berserk movie trilogy.Starting out in what could be called the ""Post-Final Crisis"" DC Universe, the Flash(who here is the second one, Barry Allen)is ambushed by the Rogues Gallery, who are suckered by Professor Zoom(the Reverse-Flash) to kill Flash. But the Justice League shows up to give Barry a hand and save everyone. Zoom goats Flash into regretting not saving his mother when he was a boy, and Flash inadvertently goes back in time to try an change things, even though in the comics it was actually Zoom who did that. Barry awakens in a new reality where his mother is still alive, but everything else has changed. In this new timeline, Aquaman and Wonder Woman have plunged Atlantis and Themyscira into a blood feud which brings the whole world into catastrophe. The Amazons have take over Britain as ""New Themyscira"", and the Atlantians are constantly trying to conquer them and the rest of the surface world. Barry realizing that he's in a different reality, but can't do anything about it because he doesn't have any super-speed now. He goes to Gotham to get help from Batman, but shocked to discover that the Batman here is Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne's father. After convincing Batman the truth behind his story, Barry has him recreate the experiment that transformed him into the Flash. The first time results in Barry getting nearly burnt alive, but a second time gets his spark going and gives him his super-speed, which luckily allows him to heals his burns quickly. The downside is though that Flash can't access the speed force which allows him to travel through time, because Prof. Zoom is here too which corrupts the speed force, and only by defeating him can Flash go back in time and change everything back to normal. So, Flash and Batman team up with Cyborg, who here is one of America's ""Man of Steel"", to then find where the real Superman is at. Kal-El was captured by the government when he first came to Earth, and kept in an underground facility. The heroes bust Kal out of there, only to be confronted by the army, and Superman flies off afterwards. Flash and the others team up with the Shazam Kids to try and flush out Zoom that the figure is somewhere in England where all the Atlantean/Amazon battles are going on. The Shazam Kids form Captain Thunder(Capt. Marvel)to take on Wonder Woman, while the others keep Aquaman busy, with some assistance from The Resistance(made of Lois Lane and Grifter). After a grueling battle, most of all the heroes die, while Zoom finally steps out of the shadows, and cripples Flash by impaling his leg. Batman manages to plug Zoom strait through the head, but only to have Aquaman activate his failsafe plan which is to turn the captured Captain Atom into a nuclear bomb which will wipe clean all life on the surface of the Earth. Realizing what is at stake, Flash somehow manages to utilize the speed force again despite his broken leg, and goes back in time to stop himself from altering it in the first place. Barry awakens back in his old reality, although it's not completely the same timeline as he now has a totally new outfit. He seems to remember the previous timeline with the world war, along with the fact that he has a letter from Thomas Wayne to give to Bruce. The ending has Flash running off in a scene very similar to most of the Spider-Man movies.This was the most brutal of all the other DC Universe movies, so even though you'd see this in the Kids Movies aisle at your local Target, it's really meant for older viewers. There's a lot of differences between this mini-series and the original comics, mostly because this isn't just a single mini-series but several tie-ins. One of the main changes is that it was Zoom himself that caused the Flashpoint timeline to come about, and not Flash. The vocal casting is very interesting with Nathan Fillion returning as Hal Jordan, Kevin Conroy as Batman(Bruce, not Thomas), Ron Pearlman as Slade, Dee Bradley Baker as Etrigan, Dana Delany as Lois Lane, and Vanessa Marshal as Wonder Woman. Additions to the cast include Hynden Walch doing a slight reprise as Harley Quinn(here, Yo-Yo) and Tim Daly's son Sam as Superman. This does act as a better Flash movie more than it does as a Justice League one. Be sure to watch all the way through to the closing credits as there's a stinger for the upcoming Justice League: War movie!",4,"Finally, a Flash movie!",1376006400,"08 9,

1646352,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00CENSU1W,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[8, 22]","Aside from some good voice talent adorning this project, DC Animated's newest (and worst) film since its inception, THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX, is a bloody, violent, and all-around unpleasant experience based on one of the worst so-called ""Event"" comic arcs in recent years, Geoff Johns' five-issue FLASHPOINT.Since it essentially replicates most of what takes place in the comic (with the exception of the opening sequence), there's no point in really rehashing all of that nonsense. The animation is going further and further away from the more classical DC animation projects that have set the standard since BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES premiered in 1992 and more towards an anime/CG style that, while being more ""current"", is sometimes too kinetic to really appreciate detail, and even worse, the animation seems perfunctory. It's seems very unfinished, and there's no real joy to looking at almost any of the scenes. The vocal work from Kevin McKidd as the Thomas Wayne Batman and the always-enjoyable Nathan Fillion as Hal Jordan/Green Lantern stand out, but despite Michael B. Jordan (an actor I really like, and does good work here as well), I just didn't care any more about Cyborg than I would in an older episode of Cartoon Network's TEEN TITANS cartoon. In fact, I care even less, because obviously Johns has his pet characters that he likes to showcase, and Cyborg is definitely one of them.If this had been a feature based entirely around the Thomas Wayne Batman and the incredibly powerful story of the ""Flashpoint"" world that was crafted by Brian Azzarello and Eduardo Rizzo, or had at least more elements of that, I would have been significantly more pleased. But that's just personal preference and not much to do with the actual product.Jay Oliva, as a director, seems to be stepping backwards here, particularly from the amazing work he'd recently done with the very well-done DARK KNIGHT RETURNS two-parter recently released. He seems to be much less focused on storytelling and character than on showing a very brutal and horrific world and brutal and horrific things that former heroes are doing to each other. Another thing to discuss in this film is the violence. How is this film not R-Rated? There is more blood and eviscerations and decapitations and death than in most of the ""Hard R"" films out there, yet somehow this ends up being PG-13? I'm certainly no prude (one of my favorite films of 2013 is the NC-17 rated BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR), but that this could somehow be okay for children as long as there's a 13-year-old around just seems wrong.Don't get me wrong; I didn't set out to dislike this. I usually prefer the animated adaptations of what DC Animated has done with less-than-stellar story arcs, particularly with the two SUPERMAN/BATMAN films (PUBLIC ENEMIES and APOCALYPSE).

1646360,A3B2NVTP78WHUE,B00CENSU1W,Jeffrey Rickel,"[13, 15]","Overall, DC Animated has done an excellent job of bringing numerous DC characters and stories to DVD/Blu-Ray over the past several years.  It's great to see these characters become more accessible to a wider audience.  Unfortunately, too many focus on the Big Two (Superman and Batman), but ignore the rest.  Yet the DC Universe is a deep one with numerous great characters and stories.Here we find a great story set in an alternate timeline - something that DC does quite well.  And it centers on the character that launched the Silver Age of Comics, Barry Allen's The Flash.This is a violent DC adaptation, but not gratuitous.  The film is well paced and plotted.  It may be necessary to know a few things about standard DC fare, like who Superman and Batman are and a bit about their backstories, though I'd guess that just about everyone knows those.If you're a DC fan, you'll be giddy to see alternate versions of favorites - Black Manta, Cyborg, Batman, etc.Yet at the heart of this is a story and a great one at that.  The beginning and end are tied together so well.  We also get to see the main character, Barry Allen as The Flash, grow from beginning to end.  There's action and consequences of those actions throughout.  You'll be left with something to think about and a desire to watch it again.This animated film also touches on the possibilities for a Justice League live action film, but also for a film of The Flash - and one is rumored to follow the next Superman flick (featuring Batman! Yay!).  When you see Flash run up a tall building, jump, glide across a helicopter blade, bounce off a building, and run on top of the water - well, you can see the cinematic possibilities of seeing his powers on display.  The Flash is so much more than just a speedster.  He may be the most powerful of all the DC stable of heroes.  I'm glad to see him at the center of a great DC Animated film finally.  Here's hoping for a great live action adaptation.This one is worth your time and money.  It's near the top of the heap of the DC Animated Universe, maybe just a notch below The Dark Knight Returns.  I recommend it, though I'd be wary with kids that are too young.  Watch it first before you let them see it.And look into the other DC Animated movies if you haven't had the chance to enjoy them.  There's a great world out there to watch and it's never too late to discover all that DC's characters have to offer.",5,DC On Parade,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,2425,"['Overall', 'DC', 'Animated', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'numerous', 'DC', 'characters', 'stories', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'great', 'see', 'characters', 'become', 'more', 'accessible', 'wider', 'audience', 'Unfortunately', 'too', 'many', 'focus', 'Big', 'Two', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'ignore', 'rest', 'DC', 'Universe', 'deep', 'one', 'numerous', 'great', 'characters', 'stories.Here', 'find', 'great', 'story', 'set', 'alternate', 'timeline', 'something', 'DC', 'quite', 'well', 'character', 'launched', 'Silver', 'Age', 'Comics', 'Barry', 'Allen', 'Flash.This', 'violent', 'DC', 'adaptation', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'film', 'well', 'paced', 'plotted', 'may', 'be', 'necessary', 'know', 'few', 'things', 'standard', 'DC', 'fare', 'who', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'are', 'bit', 'backstories', ""'d"", 'guess', 'just', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'DC', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'be', 'giddy', 'see', 'alternate', 'versions', 'favorites', 'Black', 'Manta', 'Cyborg', 'Batman', 'etc.Yet', 'heart', 'story', 'great', 'one', 'beginning', 'end', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'main', 'character', 'Barry', 'Allen', 'Flash', 'grow', 'beginning', 'end', 'action', 'consequences', 'actions', ""'ll"", 'be', 'left', 'something', 'think', 'desire', 'watch', 'again.This', 'animated', 'film', 'also', 'possibilities', 'Justice', 'League', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'also', 'film', 'Flash', 'one', 'rumored', 'follow', 'next', 'Superman', 'flick', 'featuring', 'Batman', 'Yay', 'When', 'see', 'Flash', 'run', 'up', 'tall', 'building', 'jump', 'glide', 'helicopter', 'blade', 'bounce', 'off', 'building', 'run', 'top', 'water', 'well', 'can', 'see', 'cinematic', 'possibilities', 'seeing', 'powers', 'display', 'Flash', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'speedster', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'powerful', 'DC', 'stable', 'heroes', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'center', 'great', 'DC', 'Animated', 'film', 'finally', 'Here', 'hoping', 'great', 'live', 'action', 'one', 'time', 'money', 'top', 'heap', 'DC', 'Animated', 'Universe', 'maybe', 'just', 'notch', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'recommend', ""'d"", 'be', 'wary', 'kids', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'Watch', 'first', 'let', 'see', 'it.And', 'look', 'other', 'DC', 'Animated', 'movies', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'enjoy', 'great', 'world', 'there', 'watch', 'never', 'too', 'late', 'discover', 'DC', 'characters', 'have', 'offer']",DCU:Justice League:Flashpoint Paradox

There is the one scene where a character kills another, it's done partly off screen but the camera does come back and you know what happens.

The style itself reminds me of anime and is more violent than previous movies but I'm not complaining.  The topic was a World War S (superhero), and war is not without extreme cruelty and violence so it added to the feel. In a word -- Epic.So what I really like is how unapologetically Wonder Woman was portrayed as a Class A superhero/heavy hitter; or in this case antihero. Personally, I did not purchase JLA Doom because of just that -- the writers and producers seemed uncomfortable in making her formidable when her multiverse counterpart, Superwoman, can knock the Big S around. This movie exhibits her as the 2nd most powerful hero, Superman being No.1.  Kudos for the balls.  I only hope that it continues, otherwise, I will only selectively purchase JLA movies.I love too how the Flash is portrayed as an elite superhero. He seemed untouchable.

Anyone who is a superhero fan in general but who hasn't read the book may feel quite lost. The plot unfolds rather incoherently and the first five minutes or so are not from the original book (from one of the crossovers). There was quite a bit of material brought in from the crossovers, such as Batman Flashpoint (the scene where Bruce was shot and his mom went insane, to become the Joker). Scenes such as this were too often mixed together with no intermediate fade or pause, making the whole film feel quite disjointed. Editing was inadequate, in my opinion. I read the book just a few months ago and felt lost with the way this film unfolded, so I can only imagine DC wrote this script solely for hardcore fans who do read most crossovers. In fairness, the title is ""The Flashpoint Paradox"", not just Flashpoint, which implies (to me at least) that there's more to it than just the core Flashpoint story.On the production side, I thought the effects were excellent, especially showing Flash running at top speed with the speed force around his body. For an animated film to present a sense of high speed on the ground must be hard to animate, and it looked fantastic so Warner Bros did a great job there. The choices made with the artistic style of the characters is a bit of a mystery to me as well--some Japanese anim&eacute; influences poorly blended with non-anim&eacute; make me wonder if there was a unified art team or if turnover happened in the middle of production.The voice acting was hit or miss, unfortunately. Most scenes were loud and clear but to my disappointment, several KEY, CRUCIAL plot elements were revealed at barely a whisper, spoken quite fast, and easily missed. I had to skip back a couple times to keep up with the dialogue of some characters even with high volume in a Dolby system.As for all the pre-release reviews: It is be based closely on the acclaimed graphic novel, not Justice League. Although ""Justice League"" was attached to the title, it was not there in the original book and done for marketing reasons. I read the GN, and it was excellent, and based 100% on the Flash, with cameos by the other characters. Batman is not Bruce Wayne, its Thomas Wayne in this alternate timeline. Superman never meets the Kents, because his pod crashed into Metropilis rather than by the Kent farm, and the gov't captured him, kept him in an underground cell where he had no powers (no access to sunlight). Please, folks, stop posting opinion reviews unless you have at least read the book or seen this film.As a fan who reads 15 DC comics per month, I would recommend this film as a purchase only to other serious fans.

It is very dark and has numerous mature themes that will reverberate with you long after the movie is over. The basic premise is the age old question - what if you could back and change the past? The answer being that if you could change it the outcome might not be what you expected. It even deals with the idea of predestination and accepting things that we cannot change. I don't want to spoil too much of the movie in a review so I will suffice to say that it's very deep and extremely entertaining. It's also very violent and absolutely not for children. This would actually be a good storyline for a major motion picture if it was done correctly. I have already watched it more than once. It's that good. Even the bonus material was interesting and educational. Now if only we could get more Geoff Johns stories in animated form like this I would be happy.,5,Gripping and thought provoking,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,983,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'amazon', 'instant', 'video', 'definitely', 'not', 'typical', 'cartoon', 'network', 'justice', 'league', 'very', 'dark', 'numerous', 'mature', 'themes', 'will', 'reverberate', 'long', 'movie', 'basic', 'premise', 'age', 'old', 'question', 'what', 'could', 'back', 'change', 'past', 'answer', 'being', 'could', 'change', 'outcome', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'expected', 'even', 'idea', 'predestination', 'accepting', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'review', 'will', 'suffice', 'say', 'very', 'deep', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'also', 'very', 'violent', 'absolutely', 'not', 'children', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'good', 'storyline', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'was', 'done', 'correctly', 'have', 'already', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'good', 'Even', 'bonus', 'material', 'was', 'interesting', 'educational', 'Now', 'only', 'could', 'get', 'more', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'stories', 'animated', 'form', 'would', 'be', 'happy']",DCU:Justice League:Flashpoint Paradox

What if pivotal events in the DC universe changed slightly to reshape our favorite super heroes and even some of the villains through a time travel butterfly effect inadvertently created by the Flash?  That is the basic premise of this film and it sure does deliver some surprises.  Not only have pivotal events changed, but a couple of members of the JL have destroyed Western Europe in their continuing battle for dominance over the planet. And nobody has even heard of Superman!It was so enjoyable that I actually watched it twice in the first 24 hours, which is something I rarely ever do with movies.

That being said, this kept pretty close to the comic book version. There were of course some changes because if you included everything from the comic books, this animated movie probably would have gone on for over 3 hours.The movie begins with Barry Allen (The Flash) at the grave of his mother, remembering the day she was murdered. He later stops The Rogues and Professor Zoom with the help of the Justice League. Zoom plants a seed in Barry's head about what he could do if he wasn't afraid.Barry wakes up the next day and finds that he has no powers and his mom is alive. However, the rest of the world has changed drastically. Aquaman and Wonder Woman's forces prepare for war against each other. There is no Superman. Batman is alive, but is very different. Cyborg is this world's greatest superhero. There is no Green Lantern.Eventually Barry find this world's Batman, and with his help, he gets his powers back. They get a squad together including Cyborg, Captain Thunder, and even find this world's Superman to help them try to prevent Wonder Woman and Aquaman from destroying this world, and finding Professor Zoom to try to get Barry back.I only had 2 complaints about this animated movie. One is the animation style. Not one of the best, particularly Superman. Too blocky. The second is, I probably wouldn't watch this one with young kids.

This one has come very, very close to being my new number one because of some very, very good points.1) as a fan of the TV show Young Justice (you can read my reviews of that show too, I highly recommend) several of the characters featured appears from the series and while not taking center stage do have fantastic parts and performances.2) The animation is stellar, visually a masterpiece, lots and lots of eye candy to go around.3) The story is amazing, it's such a good story told in a very serious way, especially since the main character (the Flash, duh) has been portrayed as kinda a goof.  This is a story that makes Flash a relevant and apex character in the DC universe.4) The multitude of cameos and recreations of dozens of characters from DC lore.  First off, you have a normal day on normal earth with a normal super-villain plan to kill of a good guy (not really normal but for this kind of show it is) then you have alternate earth with alternate heroes acting in ways that these characters traditionally would never act like, some so radically different it's hard to figure because the name doesn't match the actions.5) Well actually I think I've said everything, I can't think of a 5 and I'm going to stop now before this paragraph gets any bigger and I spill the beans about the entire show/story/movie/fantastic piece of work.

After reading all the gushing reviews I can only believe DC fans have been so starved for anything decent to come down the pike they want to elevate the craptacular to art. Writing a gushing review for this movie is akin to crowing about having the best looking Yugo in the parking lot. There are more plot holes here than potholes on a road in Alaska. Characters act out of character because... shut up!But here is the biggest letdown of them all : the most beautiful animation of the Flash - EVER! - is only about 45 seconds long right before the credits when it doesn't mean a damn thing. Think the original Spider-Man movies where you get to swing along with ol' Web-head. Trust me - fanboys will jizz about a bathtub full when they see Flash skip off the moving blades of a helicopter. Sadly, like falling in love with a beautiful woman who is a cuddly ball of crazy, it's over far too quickly.But the thing that really, really... R-E-A-L-L-Y gets to me is how a man who can move faster than the speed of light could ever get caught in a thrown or fired trap. Seriously? A man with the speed and reactions to live a lifetime in one-billionth of a second can be brought low by a projectile? It just bugs the hell out of me how the Flash is trapped like a rat at the beginning of the movie, but towards the end is deftly dodging machine gun bullets with aplomb... on water, no less. I guess I am trying to say the writing on this movie was a mess, like it was written by a... well, a committee of fanbois.I ended up watching this movie about five times the first time I watched it, only because I kept backing it up to see if I missed anything.

1646399,A3178K9AHMHCQV,B00CENSU1W,Luminus,"[3, 6]","Some spoilers involved:This movie is incredibly violent.  I just want to get that part out of the way, so you understand what you're getting yourself into.  If you're an avid comic reader or have been in the past, then the violence in this film will be no shock to you.  As a comicbook reader myself, I've longed for that level of violence and grittiness to be translated on screen and it sort of has in a few instances (Batman: Red Hood, Batman Beyond: the Return of the Joker, Superman vs. The Elite, and Wonder Woman), but nothing at all like what I witnessed in this film.  And it is glorious!In a nutshell, after a flashback of Barry Allen finding his mother's murdered body, the Flash defeats a host of his rogues gallery, who are working together to defeat him.  It turns out that Zoom, the reverse Flash, has put together this team of villains in an elaborate attempt to kill the flash and millions of people, including the villains themselves.  His plan is of course thwarted by the Justice League and the villains are taken to prison, but not before Zoom gives Flash an ominous warning about his family.  Now this is where some confusion happens, but more on that later.Flash awakens to find that the world and history has changed, most specifically, his mother is now alive, thus rendering him powerless as the accident responsible for creating the Flash never happened or something like that.  You see, it's never made clear why the Flash has no powers or why his mother being alive would stop the accident that causes the birth of the Flash.  I don't read Flash comics, so maybe that information is obvious to Flash fans.  In any case, Batman now uses guns, Cyborg works for the government, Hal Jordan never became Green Lantern, Martha Wayne is apparently the Joker (shown in a flashback), Kal-El is a prisoner of the government, and Aquaman is feuding with Wonder Woman with the world caught in the middle.Now here's where things get tricky.  There's a scene where Batman breaks several of Barry Allen's fingers, when he finds him in the Bat Cave.  However, this injury is never mentioned again after he convinces Batman to release his hand.  There isn't even any distress his voice, which is the same problem that happens later, when Zoom is literally beating the crap out of the Flash after brutally stabbing him with a metal rod.  There's also an ambiguity about who killed Barry Allen's mother, which is why I brought up the incident earlier where Zoom seems to threaten the Flash's family.In the comics, Zoom is the one who went back in time and killed Barry's mother.  However, in this film, it's not shown why the world has changed other than a line of dialogue from Zoom about Flash changing history by saving his mother.  We later see current Flash stop the past Flash from stopping the murder, but the murderer's face is never shown.  It's obscured by the window pane.  It may or may not be Zoom who's doing the killing, but it's never made clear.  In fact, it might be Barry's father walking into the room, just before Zoom shows up to kill Barry's mother.Now to the controversy, there's a particularly brutal scene in this movie that may or may not shock you into disgust.  I don't how many of these critics have actually been paying attention to comicbooks over the years, but violence on children is not a new thing.  Robin, a child, has been killed, brainwashed, tortured, resurrected and turned into a murderer between movies and comics and no one bats an eye.  Needless to say, a child is brutally murdered on screen (it's not Robin).Overall, the movie was fantastic and I highly recommend it.  That final scene of the Flash running through the city is iconic and I hope Warner Bros. decides to end their Flash movie with the same scene.  Also, stick around for the after credit's teaser.  I haven't read Flashpoint, so I'm not sure what it means.  I suspect that it has something to do with the Vertigo and Wildstorm universes merging with DC as a result of this incident.",5,Watch for the after credit's scene.

I read the books as they came out and they didn't reveal that Barry was the cause until the very end.  So I have my doubts as to how well this will work.I was not impressed with the outcome in the comics.  The idea that straight-arrow Barry Allen (more of a boyscout than even Clark Kent) would mess with the time line and THEN be surprised that things could turn out badly is more than a bit absurd.  I can't see the character, as established over decades, would do this.  After all, he has major experience with time travel, more so than nearly anyone else in the DC universe.Even with the motivation of saving his mother, I can't imagine that he would do such a thing.  And why now?  He'd had the ability to do this for years.  I don't recall anything in the pre-52 timeline that would justify the sudden change of heart.While many of the Flashpoint stories were well done, in my opinion, all of it was tainted when they revealed how the events were triggered.  A great deal of the post-Flashpoint stories aren't logical.  The Batman and Green Lantern lines are virtually unchanged, while other series went through wholesale revisions?  Much of the books seemed to be shifted toward younger audiences, who are used to video games.DC, as a business, has a right to move towards a new model that sells more books and adds other revenue streams.  But I dropped most Marvel and independent books because they became  mainly about action, glamor and shock value, with less about people.  That trend seems to have overtaken the DC books.Even the Batman books have succumbed to this.  The Court of Owls arc, while containing some very good stories, made no sense at the core.  Batman didn't have any idea that the organization existed?  The ultimate paranoid information freak thought it was only a myth?  Despite numerous times seeing myths as germinating from a seed of truth?I rarely review movies and never before one I haven't seen.  But I know too much about the source material to think that this will go well.  Maybe my rating is too harsh (not 1 star on the off chance they make silk from a sow's ear).  Time will tell.

At the time, I did not know that it was going to be the linchpin to change the entire DC Universe.The Blu-ray version of the comic series/graphic novel/series is condensed a lot, but all of the major points of the story are intact.  Since the Blu-ray is out now and the stories were released a couple years ago, I'm not going to worry about spoilers.My 15 year old watched the movie version with me and wasn't familiar with the story.  He's more into reading Deadpool these days.  Like me, he was in awe of all the ramifications of the changes in the characters.  Thomas Wayne presents a much different Batman than Bruce Wayne, and I can remember being shocked by that when I read the original issues as they were coming out.The whole Wonder Woman/Aquaman war just never really worked for me.  I just couldn't see those two characters being so radically different than the heroes I'd grown up with.  I think a lot of comics readers felt the same way I did.  The thing that really worked in the comics, and works again in the Blu-ray, is the friendship that develops between Thomas Wayne and Barry Allen.  I also loved the way Barry is presented, how human and how much of an everyman he is in spite of his superspeed.  His dedication to ""recovering"" his powers is testimony to the kind of man he is.The Blu-ray version kind of falls apart in relaying what's going on in the rest of the world.  There are almost too many jumps, too many characters introduced, killed, etc., but leaving them out would have been a mistake.  I think the video should have been longer to allow such a big story to breathe.I also want to warn parents that even though this Blu-ray movie is rated PG-13, I think it should have been rated an R for the violence and content.  People are constantly dying, sex is heavily hinted at, and at one point Wonder Woman stabs a young boy with her sword.  Even though the last is off-screen, viewers know what's going on.The colors were well done, but I wasn't all that happy with the character art.

1646412,AFJ27ZV9183B8,B00CENSU1W,Michael A. Martin,"[5, 15]","I initially saw a review of this on Amazon.  I then went and read some of the reviews and the plot synopsis on Wikipedia.  I had bad feelings about it but put it in my queue in Netflix anyway.  I agree with another reviewer in general when he pointed out that, generally speaking, Marvel makes better live action movies but DC usually makes better animated movies.  Unfortunately, this movie is the exception to that rule.This movie errs right from the beginning in that it automatically assumes that whoever watches it has already read the graphic novel (which I didn't).  There are too many unexplained issues with the story all the way through to make any sense to any rational viewer.  We are led to believe (although never actually shown) that the Flash went back in time to stop his mother from being murdered and the resulting story is the result of his actions.  How in the world would stopping one person's criminal death result in the complete distortion of so many completely unrelated persons' behavior and actions?  This makes no sense at all.  The animation itself is extremely crude and frankly reminds me more of a 1990's cartoon than anything else.  The voice acting was alright but other than the Flash nothing else stands out.  As has been stated elsewhere, basically Aquaman and Wonder Woman have an affair that goes horribly wrong and then start murdering everybody else in the world in order win said war.  With  the real Superman nowhere in sight (and frankly his appearance in the movie was so marginal he might as well have not been there at all), this movie is largely one atrocity after another committed not by the villains one would expect, but mostly by the so called heroes one might have expected to see solving the issue instead of creating it.  This movie should have had an R rating at the very least. The atrocities have been listed in detail in other reviews so I won't repeat them here but this movie was just a complete disappointment all the way through  - with only one exception.  I agree with others who have stated that it is about time the Flash was given a serious role and treated like an adult superhero instead of a goofball who can move very fast.I guess my most serious gripe with this movie is based more on the moral tone  than anything else.  For better or worse, comic book heroes are the 20th century's mythology/fairy tales.  While I have no doubt that the story might be considered intellectually interesting, the fact is that hard core comic geeks are a very small part of the customer base of those who buys these movies.  The majority of people who buy these movies are probably not comic geeks, but casual viewers and (more importantly) parents of kids who want to watch these types of movies.  IMO, regardless of freedom of the press, copyright ownership, or production staff &#34;vision&#34; of how a story should be told, there are some lines you shouldn't cross -  and this movie pretty much crosses all of them.  The fact that this DVD shows the second worst sales figure of all the animated movies DC has yet released will, I hope, be a sign to the powers that be to rein in their production staff a little more in future releases.

1646423,A1Z1ZP2QPD9D3L,B00CENSU1W,Movie Gal With a Brain,"[2, 5]","""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" is a revelation.  An all-too-rare gem of a film that goes to places with classic comic book superheroes you can't imagine any group of filmmakers would dare.  It's one thing to read and see a story like this on the page.  It's an entirely different thing to experience it on a visceral level as a motion picture.Based upon the DC comics storyline ""Flashpoint"" by Geoff Johns, ""The Flashpoint Paradox"" is - at heart - an emotional, introspective journey centered on one of DC's lesser-known heroes, Barry Allen aka the Flash.Screenwriter Jim Krieg skillfully manages to adapt most of Johns' main storyline while adding an original prologue that emotionally anchors the film in Barry Allen's tragic childhood loss of his mother, and the guilt he carries into his adult life in not having saved her life.  Krieg has also scripted a smart, humorous and sophisticated opening action sequence involving the main Justice League characters.  Like most great screenwriters, Krieg knows if you're going to deconstruct the most famous DC superheroes throughout your script, showing them as brutal vigilantes and ruthless killers for the balance the film, you better first give them all a moment to shine at their heroic best.This is a time-travel story into an alternative universe, and following these opening scenes, Barry Allen awakes from dozing-off at his workstation to find a world inverted.  DC's most enduring heroes are now the most violent, out-of-control threat the planet has ever faced.Bruce Wayne was killed, not his parents.  His father Thomas Wayne is the Batman, an alcoholic consumed by loss who dispatches his victims with a gun in each hand or a toss off a rooftop.  Aquaman and Wonder Woman are at war, with the Amazons having invaded the UK, slaughtering millions, and turning it into their new Paradise Island.  Kal-El didn't land in Kansas to be raised by the Kents.  He instead crash landed in Metropolis, where he has been kept underground and experimented on by the government.In 1985 when Alan Moore was developing the graphic novel ""Watchmen,"" his intent was to utilize established superheroes from the Charlton Comics line that DC had just purchased.  DC managing editor Dick Giodano vetoed the idea, concerned that depicting the characters in a ""dysfunctional"" manner, or showing them being killed off in the mini-series would hurt their `brand potential.'The approach producer James Tucker, writer Jim Krieg and director Jay Oliva have taken in adapting ""Flashpoint"" is in many ways what Moore wanted to do with ""Watchmen."" Moore had reasoned ""as long as readers recognized them (the characters) ... `it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was.' ""  Or, in the case of ""The Flashpoint Paradox,"" when you see what the reality of the characters are in a dark alternative universe.While the alternate universe `versions' of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman are the result of an anomaly in the `DC timeline,' seeing them commit graphic acts of violence and murder against each other, additional characters from the DC Universe, and a global mass populous elicits a very disturbing and shocking viewing experience.  Like the DCUAOM release ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises Part 2,"" the level of graphic violence makes it inconceivable that the MPAA gave the film a PG-13 rating as opposed to a R rating.But, let's be very clear on this point.  Every moment of graphic violence, adult language and mature situations is VITAL to making this film work on a complex sophisticated level very much in the vein of Bryan Singer's two `X-MEN' films, Zach Snyder's adaptation of ""WATCHMEN,"" and Christopher Nolan's `DARK KNIGHT' trilogy.  This is a film for adults, not kids.  To water it down is to destroy it artistically.Like the ""Watchmen"" graphic novel and Zach Snyder's feature adaptation of it, ""The Flashpoint Paradox"" is a film for adults who aren't afraid to explore the dark notion proposed by Johns' ""Flashpoint"" series.  A dark notion that ""The Flashpoint Paradox"" brings to full fruition with maximum emotional and intellectual impact.  Namely, dark consequences would befall powerful superheroes and the world if one tragic twist of fate impacted their lives on a deeply traumatic emotional level.The film is able to reach these heights thanks to just how far the creative team was prepared to go, and how high they were willing to claw their way up to reach.Director Jay Oliva (""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"") knows how to do action - he was one of Zach Snyder's storyboard artists on ""Man of Steel.""  With ""The Flashpoint Paradox"" he has deftly mixed multiple approaches in character design and animation techniques.  Traditional anime, anatomic realism and exaggerated physique designs vary from scene to scene.  This yields a wider range of emotions than the previous DCUAOMs Justice League titles have contained and explored, save ""New Frontier.""  The results also pay-off in a higher level of kinetic energy in his action sequences.  At times, all three animation approaches appear on screen at once - with the genius being it all rings true and works.Legendary Casting and Voice Director Andrea Romano's work on the film yields phenomenal detail.  Justin Chambers (""Grey's Anatomy"") delivers the best Barry Allen/The Flash performance in a DCUAOM since Neil Patrick Harris portrayed the character in 2008's ""Justice League: The New Frontier.""  Chambers' balances a newfound level of gravitas for Barry Allen with the humor that has always been a key element of the character.C. Thomas Howell buries himself in the roll of Professor Zoom, and its obvious he had a ball playing the film's central villain.  Michael R. Jordan (currently starring in ""Fruitvale Station"") walks the line between sincerity and naivety as Cyborg without ever giving into being less than the best soldier the US has.  Cary Elwes (""The Princess Bride,"" ""Saw"") gives a majestic, bold and tense presence to his role as Aquaman.Towering above them all is Kevin McKidd (also from ""Grey's Anatomy"") as Thomas Wayne, aka Flashpoint Batman.  Disillusioned, cynical, unpredictable and violent, McKidd's performance is laced with both overt and repressed rage throughout.  Yet, he hits great beats of humor and pathos.This time out, the detail in Romano's Casting Work is amazing.  Both ""Batman,"" ""Superman"" and ""Justice League"" animated series veterans Kevin Conroy, Dana Delany and Nathan Fillion are back in their roles as Batman, Lois Lane and Green Lantern.  The fact their appearances are virtually cameos didn't deter her from getting them.  More importantly, their performances add just as much as the lead actors' do to the overall artistry of the piece as a phenomenal example of `Ensemble Acting' in an Animated Motion Picture.  Romano even managed to get Ron Perlman (""Pacific Rim,"" ""Hellboy"") and Danny Huston (""Hitchcock,"" ""Wrath of the Titans"") to take very minor roles.Getting Conroy back was of vital creative importance for the film's final and very emotional closing scene.  It's worth crediting his loyalty to DC Animation that he recognized, for this film, his small contribution was major.Frederik Wiedmann's original score must be given its due as well.  Rich and layered with textures specifically designed for the emotional range of the film, Wiedmann also delivers distinct themes for the Amazons, Aquaman's army, the Flash, and Flashpoint Batman.  Here's hoping when Christopher Drake isn't available to score future DCUAOMs, Wiedmann gets the assignments.Finally, DC Animation Supervising Producer James Tucker must be acknowledged for his courage and artistic integrity in backing the film's daring content and artistic achievement.His statements to the press upon replacing Bruce Timm as the DC Animation Supervising Producer made it clear that DCUAOMs were headed in a new, commercial direction. No longer would direct adaptations of graphic novels be done as DCUAOMs (""Batman: Year One,"" ""The Dark Knight Returns""), and `brand names' like `Justice League' would be embraced as vehicles to introduce new characters.  After DC Animation's announcement that two `Justice League' titles in 2013 would be followed by two `Batman' titles in 2014, it seemed DC Animation was possibly being co-opted by the Warner Bros. Live Action division to support and promote their plans for a JLA film, along with Zach Snyder's challenge in rebooting Batman for his ""Man of Steel"" sequel.However, if ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" is indicative of how Tucker plans to meld any potential Warner-Bros. mandated commercialism and cross-promotion of DCUAOMs with his team still taking huge creative risks and maintaining the artistic integrity of DCUAOMs, Tucker is truly taking DC Animation and their films into a new, exciting and subversive direction for fans.If the upcoming ""Justice League: War"" and ""Batman and Son"" are as daring, uncompromising, challenging and adult as ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox,"" James Tucker will have initial nay-Sayers like myself eating crow and crying `mea-culpa' pretty damn fast.",5,Gutsy and Brilliant - The `Watchmen' of DCUAOM's JL Films,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,9144,"['Justice', 'League', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'revelation',

I've only read bits and pieces of that event so this will be a review of the movie on its own merits. The story begins with a young Barry Allen coming home to find that his house has been broken into and his mother brutally murdered. We flash forward (sorry) to the present day where an adult Barry Allen is putting flowers on his mother's grave, only to be notified that there has been a break-in at the Flash Museum. On arrival, he encounters a veritable rogue's gallery of his top foes, including the Top, Mirror Master, Heat Wave, Captain Cold, Boomerang, and the Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne).Thawne has hired the other Rogues to distract Flash while he carries out his plan, trapping Barry in a future-technology adhesive that will never give way, while he plants half a dozen bombs, on the various Rogues and on Flash, intending to erase not only Barry Allen, but also his museum and the surrounding city blocks. Barry manages to trap Thawne in his own adhesive but Thawne decides it's worth it to die if it means that Allen dies, as well. Allen summons the Justice League to assist but they are unable to handle the future technology and disarm the bombs. Flash tells them to take the Rogues Gallery members away to try to disarm the bombs away from the city, leaving Allen and Thawne behind. The various solutions are novel and the sequence is riveting.As Thawne is led away, another scheme in ruins, he drops a bombshell: &#34;Enjoy your petty little victories, Flash. For no matter how fast you run, you can't save everyone. Not the ones that matter to you.&#34; Allen is shocked as he puts two and two together. Batman tries to reassure Flash and asks him if he's okay. Flash responds: &#34;Don't worry about me, Bats. I'm fine. Nothing I can't run off.&#34;This was a terrific prologue, setting the stage beautifully for the story that is to follow. The next scene shows a groggy Barry Allen waking up at his desk at the Police Department. To his astonishment, he sees a breaking news report that &#34;Citizen Cold&#34; is battling Captain Boomerang. Barry runs off to put a stop to the struggle but finds, to his even greater astonishment, that his costume ring is gone, that he is unable to muster any speed, and that, as he trips on the steps leading out into the sidewalk, his mother is still alive.In the world in which he finds himself, his mother was never murdered, Iris West has married another man and has a child, Citizen Cold is a hero, the Flash never existed, a young Bruce Wayne was killed and his father, Thomas Wayne, has become a much darker, gun-wielding Batman, who's not above killing his foes. We also find out that Cyborg is a much more decked-out version, who has a role as a National Security Advisor, and who is trying to assemble heroes into a league, including Enchantress, Pied Piper, Citizen Cold, Shade, Sandman, and the Shazam kids. They're hoping to persuade Batman to join, in order to help them counteract the global war that has resulted from a fight between Atlantis and Themiscyra, where Aquaman has flooded Western Europe and Wonder Woman has invaded the United Kingdom and renamed it New Themiscyra. The new league has to take out Aquaman and Wonder Woman to stop their war before it overwhelms the planet.Barry's next move is to Gotham City. He needs answers and he figures that Batman is the most likely candidate to help him. He breaks into the Wayne Manor, and into the Batcave,where he finds a very angry Batman. Barry tries to convince him of the truth, that something in the past has caused the present to be drastically altered. And if this isn't corrected, the world may come to an end. Allen persuades Wayne to give him a chance and they try to recreate the accident that led to him becoming the Flash in the first place. After one spectacular failure, a second attempt succeeds.Meanwhile, in New Themiscyra, Colonel Steve Trevor is on the run. He was unable to locate the resistance or the &#34;package&#34; he was supposed to meet (Lois Lane, a prize-winning journalist who has been gathering intel for Cyborg). He is caught by Diana, Queen of the Amazons, and after he has told what he knows under the influence of the Lasso of Truth, he is brutally hanged by that very lasso. In case it wasn't clear, this is most assuredly not a movie for young children.A somewhat similar mission, led by Deathstroke and Luthor, to find Aquaman's doomsday weapon, ends in failure as Aquaman wipes out the ship and its crew, including some meta-humans that were part of the search. Back in the U.S., Cyborg pleads for more time but the President declines to give him the time. The U.S. military will act now, attempting to take out the WMDs before Aquaman can use them.In a flashback with no words, we see snapshots of some of the events that led up to the present day. Arthur and Diana meet as rulers of two peoples but are smitten with one another and have an affair. Queen Mera catches them and is overwhelmed with grief and rage. She attacks Diana but is killed in the conflict between them. A bloodthirsty Diana cuts off her head and takes her tiara as her own. A grieving Arthur broods over the body of his queen. A young Bruce Wayne is killed in Crime Alley as his father subdues the gunman and his mother succumbs to madness. A spaceship from Krypton lands but it lands in Metropolis, too far away for Jonathan and Martha Kent to reach it. Abin Sur's ring doesn't select anyone on earth... Well, you get the drift.Time travel and altered future stores are practically a clich&eacute;, going back decades in science fiction stories. The best of these stories take a single pivot pint and then extrapolate from that point. What if Hitler hadn't invaded Russia? What if JFK hadn't been assassinated? What if the 2000 Florida vote count had gone the other way? I'm not going to reveal the tipping point, nor the individual who changed it, but I will say that the one major flaw in this film, as in the original comic, is that the tipping point has little to do with what happened next. They attempt to explain this by saying that when you break the time barrier, there's a &#34;time boom, ripples of distortion radiated out from the point of impact.&#34; It's ironic...all the unbelievable things in this movie and this is the one I have trouble with?Back to the movie: this is a dark, apocalyptic vision of the future, brutal and bloody. Barry watches, as one after the other, his allies are brought down and his hopes are dashed in an all-out war between the Amazons and Atlantis until, at last, the ultimate weapon is unleashed, destroying all before it. Barry has just one last desperate chance to save the world, a chance bought with the sacrifice of one of those allies. The coda on this film is very moving, a fitting end and a redemption of sorts.Despite my gripes about the tipping point, this is an all-too-believable conflict between two warrior peoples, between two stubborn and proud leaders, in a world gone mad. It's a riveting story, particularly for the comic book fan as we look for clues to what happened to our favorite characters in this world. Superman? Check. Hal Jordan? Check. And so on. The animation is superb and the voice acting is very well done. There are no major standouts other than, perhaps, Kevin McKidd as both Batmans, but there are also no weak links. The story is tense and exciting and, all told, this is easily in the top five of the DC Universe animated movies.",5,Days of future past,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,7829,"['34', 'God', 'grant',

This change goes horribly wrong by creating major ripples in time, leading to an all out and devasting war between the underwater people of Atlantis and the warrior Amazon women.How does this war start?  Picture the somewhat graphic image of Queen Diana (Wonder Woman) of the Amazons holding in her hand the lifeless head of Queen Mera, wife of King Aquaman of Atlantis....  By the end of this saga, the war becomes all consuming and horrific in its nature.Please note that there are many graphic images, including the usual guns and bullets, arrows and swords, blood and gore, people pounding with no mercy on people, and of people being blown to bits.  There are sea monsters, helping Atlantis, and land monsters from Greek mythology, helping the Amazons.  I don't want to overstate the violence, but you may want to preview this animated war film.  For many, it may not be appropriate for young children.  This is not your usual Saturday children's animated hero show.However, there is one graphic scene with Queen Diana (Wonder Woman) that really shocked me.  In this segment, Queen Diana battles a Captain Marvel like character and subdues him with her magic lasso.  Queen Diana forces him to say Shazam,  reverting him back to 6 children.  Off camera, Queen Diana puts one of the kids to the sword (and presumably the other 5 kids as well!).  Wow, that really stunned me.Furthermore, wonder what happens when Queen Diana meets Steve Trevor?  Well, their first meeting is his last meeting.Aquaman is equally evil and without mercy.  He thrusts his trident into Lex Luther and rips Cyborg apart, piece by piece, revealing Cyborg's beating heart.  And Aquaman plays a pivotal part in starting the war when he commits a major indiscretion, showing a great lapse in moral judgement.By the decisions made by Aquaman and Queen Diana, parts of the earth are laid waste.The main characters in this film are Flash, Batman, and Cyborg, along with Aquaman and Wonder Woman.  Superman's character and Hal Jordan play minor roles.  There are quite a few supporting characters including versions of Aqualad, Black Manta, Ocean Master, and assorted villains and heroes.Finally, on an emotional note, there is Barry Allen (Flash) and his relationship with his mother and there is an unusual twist involving Bruce Wayne and his father, Dr. Wayne.  There is also a tragic and not so funny implied twist regarding Bruce Wayne's mother....

The story begins with our hero Flash/Barry Allen (Justin Champers) waking up to find out that his life has changed; his murdered mother is alive, a war is going on and he has no super speed. Barry has no idea what's going on, but it's up to him to not only save his life, but the world too. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Keefer Blakeslee (age 13) loves it and warns, ""This is not a movie for little kids. It has graphic animated blood and bad language."" For older kids, he thinks it's great, with outstanding animation and true to the original comic book story. See his full review below.I love the animation. Not only are the action scenes outstanding, but the details on the characters faces are astonishing. When their face moves, so do their shadows. It's special. The story is engaging. If you're a comic book reader you'll find the movie follows the comics respectfully, while still having its own originality. The characters are well evolved. Like any life changing story, if one person changes others change too. Batman, Wonder Woman and even Superman change for the worst and it's fascinating to see the consequence. An issue in this film is the graphic animated blood and bad language. I know it's rated PG-13 and, to be fair, the blood does blend well with the shadow's and costume's but, on the case it says SFI violence and action throughout. Be forewarned.My favorite character is Batman (Kevin McKidd - None-other than the Dark Knight himself) Here is the twist: he uses guns instead of gadgets or drinks and is ruthless. That's because Batman is not the person you think he is... This makes him more interesting because you see a different side of Batman. I love it when they do that to a well-known character.My favorite scene is the back-story of Batman. It's not the story people are familiar with. What makes this scene stand out is the dark and brooding tone. It's both sad and morose and, sort of twisted.The moral of the story is, accept the things you can not change but have the courage to change the things you can. The Flash blames himself for his mother's death and thinks if he was there, he would have saved her. Sadly, he discovers he needs to focus on the things he can alter.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. This is not a movie for little kids. It has graphic animated blood and bad language. If you're older, you can enjoy the action and story. You can get Flashpoint Paradox on DVD now.Reviewed by Keefer B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Holly ""piper909""","[2, 4]","The latest Justice League animated film will puzzle some, with its revised cast of characters, new interpretations of others, and harsh anime-derived look, much different from the TV series or  the ""New Frontier"" film. Don't look for continuity with earlier Justice Leagues, accept this as a stand-alone story, with some nods to the ""New 52"" DC comics line, I suspect.  Much that you think you knew about these characters has changed, and not only because of the alternate time-line presented in ""Flashpoint"".The story is perhaps a bit over-stuffed, and seems to veer into the ""let's make up some more new stuff"" more often than it needs to, leaving many avenues unexplored and some conflicts unresolved. (I mean, Thomas Wayne's wife is now the Joker?!?)  The fighting femmes of the League are given short shift here -- only Wonder Woman represents the distaff side, which is a pity for fans of Zatanna, Black Canary, Hawkgirl, and etc.  The voice acting is up to the usual high standards and helps make up for the angular and ugly art stylings and a higher-than-normal level of violence.  (I detect the unhappy influence of videogames in both of these complaints.) But I'm always interested in alternate realities and elseworlds, which is pretty much what this plot is about, so if you share these inclinations you will find much to surprise and amuse you in Flashpoint.  For the rest, it is loud, splashy, and melodramatic, a comic book movie that seldom sits still, and if the visuals dominate the storyline, that's to be expected these days.

Atlantis has risen and sunk half of Europe.  Aquaman and Wonder Woman are waging a civil war. The Batman is a gun toting killer. Superman never appeared in Smallville.  The Rogues are heroes.Think Back to the Future 2 as a Greek tragedy with superheroes.The film is a chaotic free-for-all of revised characters and lots and lots of killing.

It's for the grown-ups.  Yet for all it's dark ugly subtext, it's very entertaining.  And I might add, it's the kind of material that would probably be a dreary disaster as a live-action film.  But animated, with the tonal lightness animation gives?  It just makes the wild stuff more passable, and the violence more dramatically intense.Not sure if I can specifically recommend the bluray over the regular DVD... for this style of animation (lower framerate, soft detail) it may not be a must, unless you are a fan of deep, saturated color and contasts. Then I'd say go for it.  The DTS 5.1 soundmix is absolutely outstanding. It's near demo material.  Voices, effects and music balance perfectly.

1646464,ATJRTEOGW5OZN,B00CENSU1W,Rons Reviews,"[2, 6]","Look, here's the deal; if you have to travel through time, or to another dimension, to tell your story, you're officially out of ideas.There is a reason the DC Universe has not translated as well to the big screen as Marvel.  Some of it is the depth of the characters, but, it's more the ability to tell stories and the stories they choose to tell.  The Green Lantern was not a good choice to be the next JLA member to put on film in 2011.On July 30th 2013, Warner Home Video brought us Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, and well, things have not gotten any better in the DC storytelling universe.If this is not spoiled for you yet: Spoiler Alert!  So The Flash (Justin Chambers) wakes up in a world that looks like his own, but isn't.  He's not fast, Superman doesn't exist, Batman is old, and Wonder Woman's Amazons are doing battle with Aquamans Atlantians and destroying the world in the process.So Barry Allen sets out to figure things out, and get back to where he belongs.  Seeking the wisdom and intelligence of Batman, he discovers that in this world, Bruce Wayne died in the alley on that fateful night and now his dad Thomas Wayne is Batman (Kevin McKidd).  First thing on the agenda; Re-create the ""accident"" that caused Barry Allen to become the Flash.  Then figure out what happened to Superman cuz we need him to stop the war.Eventually things get worked out, but not before numerous unusual plotlines are introduced and not explored.Regardless of how old you are, this is not the Justice League of your youth.  Partly because it is a timeline that none of us are familiar with, and hopefully won't become familiar with cuz it's lame, but also because this DC JLA story is more violent than any previous incarnation, and unnecessarily so.  Almost as if they knew the story was bad and decided it needed something to make it unique.The animation and performances are of no help to this production.  The animation is awkward and inconsistent at best. Often reminiscent of Anime from the sixties, it seemed like Kimba could run by at any moment.  The performances were consistently stoic, but that was probably more the fault of the writers (Geoff Johns -Original Story, Jim -Screenplay) than the actors.Recommendation:  The Flash remains under utilized in the DC universe, and what should have been a showcase for the talents and entertainment value of the speedster, lags far behind his potential.We can hope that the Feature Film scheduled for 2016 will deliver, but until then, the cartoons of the sixties or the television show of 1990 will have to do.",2,Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,2575,"['Look', 'here', 'deal', 'have', 'travel', 'time', 'dimension', 'tell', 'story', ""'re"", 'officially', 'ideas.There', 'reason', 'DC', 'Universe', 'not', 'translated', 'as', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'Marvel', 'depth', 'characters', 'more', 'ability', 'tell', 'stories', 'stories', 'choose', 'tell', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'choice', 'be', 'next', 'JLA', 'member', 'put', 'film', '2011.On', 'July', '30th', '2013', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'brought', 'Justice', 'League', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'well', 'things', 'have', 'not', 'gotten', 'better', 'DC', 'storytelling', 'universe.If', 'not', 'spoiled', 'yet', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Flash', 'Justin', 'Chambers', 'up', 'world', 'own', ""n't"", 'not', 'fast', 'Superman', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Batman', 'old', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Amazons', 'are', 'doing', 'battle', 'Aquamans', 'Atlantians', 'destroying', 'world', 'process.So', 'Barry', 'Allen', 'out', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'get', 'back', 'where', 'Seeking', 'wisdom', 'intelligence', 'Batman', 'world', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'died', 'alley', 'fateful', 'night', 'now', 'dad', 'Thomas', 'Wayne', 'Batman', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'First', 'thing', 'agenda', 'Re-create', 'accident', 'caused', 'Barry', 'Allen', 'become', 'Flash', 'Then', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Superman', 'cuz', 'need', 'stop', 'war.Eventually', 'things', 'get', 'worked', 'out', 'not', 'before', 'numerous', 'unusual', 'plotlines', 'are', 'introduced', 'not', 'explored.Regardless', 'how', 'old', 'are', 'not', 'Justice', 'League', 'youth', 'Partly', 'timeline', 'none', 'are', 'familiar', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'become', 'familiar', 'cuz', 'lame', 'also', 'DC', 'JLA', 'story', 'more', 'violent', 'previous', 'incarnation', 'unnecessarily', 'so', 'knew', 'story', 'was', 'bad', 'decided', 'needed', 'something', 'make', 'unique.The', 'animation', 'performances', 'are', 'help', 'production', 'animation', 'awkward', 'inconsistent', 'best', 'Often', 'reminiscent', 'Anime', 'sixties', 'seemed', 'Kimba', 'could', 'run', 'moment', 'performances', 'were', 'consistently', 'stoic', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'fault', 'writers', 'Geoff', 'Johns', '-Original', 'Story', 'Jim', '-Screenplay', 'actors.Recommendation', 'Flash', 'utilized', 'DC', 'universe', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'showcase', 'talents', 'entertainment', 'value', 'speedster', 'far', 'potential.We', 'can', 'hope', 'Feature', 'Film', 'scheduled', '2016', 'will', 'deliver', 'then', 'cartoons', 'sixties', 'television', 'show', '1990', 'will', 'have', 'do']",DCU:Justice League:Flashpoint Paradox
1646465,A2AFM0SLLFPSJ1,B00CENSU1W,"Savant11 ""Savant11""","[0, 0]","This is hands down the best Superhero Animated film I have ever seen. The film takes place in a parallel universe of earth where there is no Justice  League.  The characters who compromise the core members exist but they  are in different roles.  Bruce Wayne is dead, his father  is a darker twisted version of Batman. Hal Jordan is not the Green Lantern but just a test pilot.  There is no Flash. Superman, as we know him, does not exist. And Wonder Woman and Aquaman  and the kingdoms they each represent are embroiled in a war which threatens to destroy the world.I've seen the parallel/alternate universe concept done in comics before. However  most of the time it is done very poorly with no effort or real thought that has gone in to it. There is also no attempt to delve deeply into the alternate universe and show how the world is different. Most of the time the worlds are just reduced into mock ups of totalitarian regimes.  Consisting of some hackneyed plot about the heroes trying to take down the evil government.However this film is a refreshing change from this boring type of storytelling.  The characters are fleshed out and given serious motivations for their actions and behavior.  Characters actions are far more human than what are normally treated to in the DCU.  People actually do things out of pride, selfishness, and ego.  This went into giving the film more depth and made you care about the characters on screen.For example Wonder Woman and Aquaman's actions are the exact type of actions I would expect to come from  two super powered beings with type A personalities.  They are both single minded in their pursuit of power and vengeance but at the same time strategic.The production values are fantastic. With great jobs in the voice acting as well as the animation.  But most of all I have to give top marks to the writer of the film Jim Krieg who not only used the source material from the original books, but also borrowed some of the accompanying books in order to make the story and the background more clear to the viewers.I was never a fan of The Flash until I saw this film. However this film really made me fall hard and fast for Barry Allen.  He had a great combination of a great heart yet a still commanding strength.  In all this is a superb production  and I certainly look forward to more such quality of work.",5,Superb!,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,2355,"['down', 'best', 'Superhero', 'Animated', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'place', 'parallel', 'universe', 'earth', 'where', 'Justice', 'League', 'characters', 'who', 'compromise', 'core', 'members', 'exist', 'are', 'different', 'roles', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'dead', 'father', 'darker', 'twisted', 'version', 'Batman', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'not', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'just', 'test', 'pilot', 'Flash', 'Superman', 'know', 'not', 'exist', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Aquaman', 'kingdoms', 'represent', 'are', 'embroiled', 'war', 'destroy', 'world.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'parallel/alternate', 'universe', 'concept', 'done', 'comics', 'However', 'most', 'time', 'done', 'very', 'poorly', 'effort', 'real', 'thought', 'gone', 'also', 'attempt', 'delve', 'deeply', 'alternate', 'universe', 'show', 'how', 'world', 'different', 'Most', 'time', 'worlds', 'are', 'just', 'reduced', 'mock', 'ups', 'totalitarian', 'regimes', 'Consisting', 'hackneyed', 'plot', 'heroes', 'trying', 'take', 'down', 'evil', 'government.However', 'film', 'refreshing', 'change', 'boring', 'type', 'storytelling', 'characters', 'are', 'fleshed', 'given', 'serious', 'motivations', 'actions', 'behavior', 'Characters', 'actions', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'human', 'what', 'are', 'normally', 'treated', 'DCU', 'People', 'actually', 'do', 'things', 'pride', 'selfishness', 'ego', 'went', 'giving', 'film', 'more', 'depth', 'made', 'care', 'characters', 'screen.For', 'example', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Aquaman', 'actions', 'are', 'exact', 'type', 'actions', 'would', 'expect', 'come', 'two', 'super', 'powered', 'beings', 'type', 'personalities', 'are', 'single', 'minded', 'pursuit', 'power', 'vengeance', 'same', 'time', 'strategic.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'fantastic', 'great', 'jobs', 'voice', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'animation', 'most', 'have', 'give', 'top', 'marks', 'writer', 'film', 'Jim', 'Krieg', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'used', 'source', 'material', 'original', 'books', 'also', 'borrowed', 'accompanying', 'books', 'order', 'make', 'story', 'background', 'more', 'clear', 'viewers.I', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'Flash', 'saw', 'film', 'However', 'film', 'really', 'made', 'fall', 'hard', 'fast', 'Barry', 'Allen', 'had', 'great', 'combination', 'great', 'heart', 'yet', 'still', 'commanding', 'strength', 'superb', 'production', 'certainly', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'such', 'quality', 'work']",DCU:Justice League:Flashpoint Paradox

Pretty dark, and I'm still not sure exactly why.Flash is a fun character, and I'm glad they finally told a story about him. Of course, the Flash they focused on was Barry Allen, and the show seemed to assume that viewers know a lot about him when I knew next to nothing. (The Flash I was familiar with is Wally.) Barry seemed...I don't know. Maybe too much like the others? I knew how Wally worked within the Justice League, but we hardly see anything of Barry and his world before we're launched into a dystopian alternate universe. Watching him in action was cool, but I didn't feel like I got much of a sense of him as a person.But the bigger problem was the larger story. I don't know whether I want to watch it again simply because I watch to be entertained and enjoy myself, not to make myself sick watching people kill or torture each other or being depressed with messages about how awful people are or life is. (I'm exaggerating a little, but not as much as I wish I was.) The story never answered critical questions. For example...SPOILERSFlash's attempt to use time travel through the Speed Force to prevent the murder of his mother is somehow responsible for all of the problems that have come about in this alternate universe. But I thought what caused the problems wasn't saving his mother in itself, but the act of breaking the chronal barrier? If so, catching up to his younger self and stopping him wouldn't have prevented any of this because his younger self had already broken that barrier. And it doesn't explain how Flash's actions could change so many things that happened at different times. (Ex: Superman's arrival as a baby, the shooting of Bruce's parents, the arrival of Abin Sur and Hal taking on the mantle of the Green Lantern. Nit pick, but why would the ring not have found Hal even if the timing had changed a little and he wasn't right there?)Then too, the story never explains critical changes in characters, specifically Wonder Woman and Aquaman. Those who developed this plot clearly don't take them seriously as heroic characters, because they have these guys go to the dark side and way above and beyond in destroying the world and others based on a tragic but isolated incident, a personal feud. The plot relies on neither of them having any sense of proportion or any concern for the impact of their conflict on the earth and on their peoples, when that is about as uncharacteristic for both of them as it gets. None of that made any sense. Heroism may be developed and fostered by associating with high-caliber people, but it comes from what's already there in people. Yet this story never explains why these characters are suddenly and somehow without any sense of morality.In any case, well-done in a lot of ways, but disturbing and with some serious plot holes so far as I'm concerned.",3,"Okay, but high violence quotient.",1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,2938,"['was', 'more', 'violent', 'expected', 'Had', 'not', 'been', 'animated', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'merited', 'R', 'rating', 'Pretty', 'dark', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'why.Flash', 'fun', 'character', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'told', 'story', 'course', 'Flash', 'focused', 'was', 'Barry', 'Allen', 'show', 'seemed', 'assume', 'viewers', 'know', 'lot', 'when', 'knew', 'next', 'nothing', 'Flash', 'was', 'familiar', 'Wally', 'Barry', 'seemed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Maybe', 'too', 'much', 'others', 'knew', 'how', 'Wally', 'worked', 'Justice', 'League', 'hardly', 'see', 'anything', 'Barry', 'world', ""'re"", 'launched', 'dystopian', 'alternate', 'universe', 'Watching', 'action', 'was', 'cool', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'got', 'much', 'sense', 'person.But', 'bigger', 'problem', 'was', 'larger', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'simply', 'watch', 'be', 'entertained', 'enjoy', 'not', 'make', 'sick', 'watching', 'people', 'kill', 'torture', 'other', 'being', 'depressed', 'messages', 'how', 'awful', 'people', 'are', 'life', ""'m"", 'exaggerating', 'little', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'wish', 'was', 'story', 'never', 'answered', 'critical', 'questions', 'example', 'SPOILERSFlash', 'attempt', 'use', 'time', 'travel', 'Speed', 'Force', 'prevent', 'murder', 'mother', 'somehow', 'responsible', 'problems', 'have', 'come', 'alternate', 'universe', 'thought', 'what', 'caused', 'problems', 'was', ""n't"", 'saving', 'mother', 'act', 'breaking', 'chronal', 'barrier', 'so', 'catching', 'up', 'younger', 'self', 'stopping', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'prevented', 'younger', 'self', 'had', 'already', 'broken', 'barrier', ""n't"", 'explain', 'how', 'Flash', 'actions', 'could', 'change', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'happened', 'different', 'times', 'Ex', 'Superman', 'arrival', 'baby', 'shooting', 'Bruce', 'parents', 'arrival', 'Abin', 'Sur', 'Hal', 'taking', 'mantle', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Nit', 'pick', 'why', 'would', 'ring', 'not', 'have', 'found', 'Hal', 'even', 'timing', 'had', 'changed', 'little', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'there', 'Then', 'too', 'story', 'never', 'critical', 'changes', 'characters', 'specifically', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Aquaman', 'who', 'developed', 'plot', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'heroic', 'characters', 'have', 'guys', 'go', 'dark', 'side', 'way', 'destroying', 'world', 'others', 'based', 'tragic', 'isolated', 'incident', 'personal', 'feud', 'plot', 'relies', 'having', 'sense', 'proportion', 'concern', 'impact', 'conflict', 'earth', 'peoples', 'when', 'about', 'uncharacteristic', 'None', 'made', 'sense', 'Heroism', 'may', 'be', 'developed', 'fostered', 'associating', 'high-caliber', 'people', 'what', 'already', 'there', 'people', 'story', 'never', 'why', 'characters', 'are', 'suddenly', 'somehow', 'sense', 'morality.In', 'case', 'well-done', 'lot', 'ways', 'disturbing', 'serious', 'plot', 'holes', 'so', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned']",DCU:Justice League:Flashpoint Paradox

It felt too far removed from the classic animation that makes the DC Animated films great.I'm definitely glad that WB Animation is trying something new, though.

I think that is how the writers WANTED the film to go.  those characters were supposed to have a smaller role than usual. kinda like how The Flash has been portrayed in most other stories.. at least the ones i've seen. also, if the writers wanted, they could have made a movie on any one of the other story lines, and all of them would have been awesome.. but they decided to put the focus on The Flash this time.. and i for one, am completely ok with that.and yes, this movie is violent.  definitely the most violent of the DC animated films.  but, as others have said, it's rated pg-13 for a reason.  its a dark film. does it cross the line?  it teeters on the edge in a couple spots.. but overall its fine.  its no less dark than some of the comic books out there, and its about time we got some film makers that arent afraid to show some of that off in an animated movie format.bottom line is.. if you are a DC fan, and are a fan of The Flash, you need this film as part of your collection.  you wont be disappointed.",5,"BY FAR, the best of the JLA animated films",1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,1699,"['film', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'following', 'quote', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'have', 'courage', 'change', 'things', 'can', 'have', 'wisdom', 'know', 'difference', 'wont', 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'premise', 'movie', 'also', 'amazing', 'quote', 'story', 'done', 'pretty', 'much', 'perspective', 'Flash', 'i', 'really', 'enjoy', 'ive', 'been', 'wanting', 'good', 'serious', 'Flash', 'film', 'boy', 'deliver', 'everything', 'amazing.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'left', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'regarding', 'other', 'characters', 'i', 'understand', 'where', 'are', 'coming', 'here', 'thing', 'though..', 'think', 'how', 'writers', 'WANTED', 'film', 'go', 'characters', 'were', 'supposed', 'have', 'smaller', 'role', 'usual', 'kinda', 'how', 'Flash', 'been', 'portrayed', 'most', 'other', 'stories..', 'least', 'ones', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'also', 'writers', 'wanted', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'one', 'other', 'story', 'lines', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'awesome..', 'decided', 'put', 'focus', 'Flash', 'time..', 'i', 'one', 'am', 'completely', 'ok', 'that.and', 'yes', 'movie', 'violent', 'definitely', 'most', 'violent', 'DC', 'animated', 'films', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'rated', 'pg-13', 'reason', 'dark', 'film', 'cross', 'line', 'edge', 'couple', 'spots..', 'overall', 'fine', 'less', 'dark', 'comic', 'books', 'there', 'time', 'got', 'film', 'makers', 'arent', 'afraid', 'show', 'off', 'animated', 'movie', 'format.bottom', 'line', 'is..', 'are', 'DC', 'fan', 'are', 'fan', 'Flash', 'need', 'film', 'part', 'collection', 'wont', 'be', 'disappointed']",DCU:Justice League:Flashpoint Paradox

1646483,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00CENSU1W,Tim Janson,"[0, 1]","Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox is the 17th DC Comics animated film from Warner Brothers and is based on the &#8220;Flashpoint&#8221; storyline written by longtime Flash scribe Geoff Johns.  While it&#8217;s titled a Justice League film, that&#8217;s more for marketing than anything as this is a Flash film all the way with only brief appearances by the JLA, or at least the JLA as we know them.You know, for a company that came up with Crisis on Infinite Earths nearly thirty years ago in an effort to clean up its universe of all its parallel worlds and the problems it created, they sure to like to create brand new alternate world storylines.  We are so many iterations removed from the Pre-Crisis DC Comics that you couldn&#8217;t find it on even the most up-to-date GPS system.The Flash, (the Barry Allen version which I have to point out BECAUSE of Crisis to begin with), arrives on the scene at a break-in at the Flash Museum and is confronted by his Rogue&#8217;s Gallery: Captain Cold, Captain Boomerang, Heat Wave, Mirror Master, and Top.  However the entire group of villains has been duped by Professor Zoom, the Reverse Flash, who intends to blow up Central City, including the Rogues.  The JLA arrives to help foil the plot and disarm a series of bombs.The following day, Barry wakes up to find he is in an alternate world where he was able to save his mother from being killed,but one in which the world has radically changed for the worse.  Bruce Wayne is dead, killed in the alley when he was a boy and instead it is his father Thomas, who has become a more violent version of Batman.  There is no Superman or Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman leads the Amazons into battle against Aquaman and the Atlanteans in a war that threatens to destroy the entire world.  On top of that, Barry no longer has his powers.Barry arrives at Wayne Manor looking for Bruce Wayne only to find it abandoned.  Descending to the Bat Cave, he&#8217;s attacked by Thomas Wayne.  Barry is able to convince Wayne that he is from an alternate world and deduces that Zoom has used the speedforce to alter time and is preventing him from running fast enough to return the world to normal.Cyborg, who now works for the government, gathers a group of heroes including Grifter, Billy Batson, and Etrigan to fight Wonder Woman.  Meanwhile Lex Luthor and Deathstroke lead a group of villains against the army of Atlantis.  Barry also discovers that a meteor fell to Earth in the heart of Metropolis thirty years earlier, coinciding with Superman arriving on Earth in Barry&#8217;s world.I&#8217;m torn on this film.  There&#8217;s much to like but also some nagging issues.  The film gives us the Flashpoint story, streamlined to its core, sans all the unnecessary side plots of the crossover comics and that&#8217;s a good thing.  It&#8217;s also great to see the Flash, especially the Barry Allen Flash, get a chance to shine even if it is disguised as a Justice League film.  For once he is treated like one of the primary heroes of the DCU rather than a second-rater.I&#8217;ve long complained that many of the DC films have been geared towards kids rather than more adult comic book fans.  Not so with this film.  This is the most brutal of any of the DC films.  Wonder Woman mercilessly hangs Steve Trevor with her golden rope until his neck snaps.  While this and several other deaths take place just off camera, the mere fact that their taking place at all lets you know this is a different animal than previous DC films.The animation is a mixed bag.  There is the same Anime influence here that we saw in the last DC film, Superman: Unbound and once again there are wild inconsistencies in the character models.  Superman, Etrigan, and Aquaman look like they were done by crossing Rob Liefeld with Mike Sekowsky and then giving them a hyper dose of HGH.  Big, blocky, overly muscled and ugly!  On the other hand, The Flash and Batman fare much better.  Director Jay Oliva packs the film with far too many supporting characters and in giving all of these characters screen time, it detracts from the central storyline.  Flash working with Batman to return to his world was far more interesting than the non-stop battles between the heroes, villains, Amazons, and Atlanteans.A vast improvement over Superman: Unbound was in the voice cast.  Kevin Conroy returns to voice the regular world Batman with Kevin McKidd doing a fine job as the tortured Thomas Wayne version of Batman.  Justin Chambers gives us a Flash that is more mature than what we&#8217;ve seen in other films and the Justice League animated show.  Other standouts included C. Thomas Howell as Professor Zoom, Ron Perlman as Deathstroke, and Cary Elwes as Aquaman with Dana Delaney returning to voice Lois Lane.In the end there are some missteps along the way but Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox is finally the kind of adult-themed film that many fans have wanted.Blu-Ray ExtrasAudio commentary with Producer James Tucker, director Jay Olivia, screenwriter Jim Krieg and comic writer Geoff Johns.A Flash in Time: Time Travel in the Flash Universe (22:00) &#8211; A look at time and time travel from Greek mythology to how time travel worked and was utilized in the DC universe, specifically with the Flash.

After The Dark Knight Returns I had mentioned how curious I was to see where these films would go after such an intense film. Well, now we have 'Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox' and I must say I never would have expected this to be what it was.Of course the basis of this film is Justice League Flashpoint, the saga that unleashed The New 52. It is a great story about The Flash a character who has yet to truly be developed in the DCAU. Sure, we got a few inklings in Justice League and even in Young Justice, but even though this film has Justice League in the title it is truly about the Flash. I always enjoy a DC alternative universe story, but this one is very different from 'Crisis on Two Earths'. This one is darker, has more intensity from a story and character stand point and unexpected graphic violence. I never would have expected to see so many cartoon characters bleed so much. The story is truly original and gripping and probably the best part of this film is Carey Elwes as the voice of Aquaman. The character is subtle yet fierce. The Batman character is definitely one way to never look at The Dark Knight the same way again. Also the voice of the '80s teen idol C. Thomas Howell as Professor Zoom  is a great villain.This film is a true winner for any fan of the DCAU. If you have been watching the DCAU as far back as the Batman days, there are definitely a lot nods a few of the shows in Bruce Timm's legacy. All in all 'The Flashpoint Paradox' is incredible and I was so surprised that it ended up being the kind of film that it was and it may in fact be one of the better ones.

I'm a Geek and proud of it, I was there when The Fantastic Four 1st appeared and Peter Parker was first bitten, when the Flash first ejected his custom from his ring and I hate this movie! One, the story is so full of holes it could sink a battleship...so what he goes back in time a saves his mother (just when does this happen?) what does that have to do with Wonder Woman or Aquaman, they are both older then his mother, Wonder Woman by a few thousand years, why would this change they personalities or beliefs.. and Batman was ""created"" years before her death (the mother's). Two, the design work is freaky, down right eerie. Three, and this is the most important, it's the principal...superheros have always been above the law in that no matter what they ""shall not kill"", that they are someone(s) to look up to, to admire..this thing spits in the face of all of that! If this is the future of comics (and by all the reviews, it sound like it might be) then count me out! Look what they did to Superman!(and again, why would her death make any of these changes!?!) Until now I used to believe that Marvel made the best live action movies and DC, the best animated movies..as soon as one came out I would grip it up sight unseen, well not any more. With all the killing and mass murders depicted in this ""film"" maybe they're right about the violence in todays comics..spoiler alert..if you haven't seen this ""movie"" yet...don't! But if you do think about it, be prepared to see Wonderwoman hang her ex-lover, kill children, and cut off a woman's head and carry it around as if it was a purse...she's a nut case and Aquaman is even worst.

I'm purposely leaving out any details about the film itself because spoilers are universally loathed. In sum, it's absolutely worth watching. Expect much more gore than you usually see in such films, a few minor curse words, and a whole lot of surreal smiles as you watch.",5,AMAZING!,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,595,"['Perhaps', 'best', 'animated', 'Justice', 'League', 'offering', 'date', 'least', 'opinion', 'plot', ""n't"", 'just', 'sandbox', 'superheroes', 'play', 'depth', 'layers', 'great', 'narratives', 'do', 'HUGE', 'ensemble', 'characters', 'lot', 'fun', 'who', 'have', 'bit', 'knowledge', 'going', 'film', ""'m"", 'purposely', 'leaving', 'out', 'details', 'film', 'spoilers', 'are', 'universally', 'loathed', 'sum', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'watching', 'Expect', 'much', 'more', 'gore', 'usually', 'see', 'such', 'films', 'few', 'minor', 'curse', 'words', 'whole', 'lot', 'surreal', 'smiles', 'watch']",DCU:Justice League:Flashpoint Paradox
