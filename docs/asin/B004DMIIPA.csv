Always remembered how good it was and never thought could get my hands on it but now own it. I am incredibly happy to have it in my anime DVD collection. It is a very fun albeit weird series.There is not much to the packaging. It has inside artwork. It has just one disk with a colorful pattern connected to the series. The on-disc extra are many though. Director and voice actor commentaries. It also has music videos connected to The Pillows the band that did pretty much all the music in FLCL. It includes clean opening and closing animation-the theme songs. The series has sub and dub.Check out more anime reviews: The Huge Anime Fan via Wordpress,5,FLCL on DVD,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,748,"['really', 'fell', 'love', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'airing', 'TV', '2005', 'thanks', 'Toonami', 'Always', 'remembered', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'never', 'thought', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'now', 'am', 'incredibly', 'happy', 'have', 'anime', 'DVD', 'collection', 'very', 'fun', 'weird', 'not', 'much', 'packaging', 'inside', 'artwork', 'just', 'one', 'disk', 'colorful', 'pattern', 'connected', 'series', 'on-disc', 'extra', 'are', 'many', 'Director', 'voice', 'actor', 'commentaries', 'also', 'music', 'videos', 'connected', 'Pillows', 'band', 'did', 'pretty', 'much', 'music', 'FLCL', 'clean', 'opening', 'closing', 'animation-the', 'theme', 'songs', 'series', 'sub', 'dub.Check', 'out', 'more', 'anime', 'reviews', 'Huge', 'Anime', 'Fan', 'Wordpress']",FLCL: The Complete Series

1397211,A25KHG6ZFB4VPU,B004DMIIPA,C.Kuma,"[102, 275]","Okay look, FLCL is an awesome Gainax OVA from the late 90's- erly 2000's there is no denying that. The point of my rating however is for the upcoming blu-ray and not the show in general. So before anyone goes hog-wild trolling this review, do your homework. There is not a true Blu-Ray quality master of FLCL in existence at this time, period. The Japanese masters for this show were scaled and rendered in 480p. In 1999-2000 when this show was in production they did not have Blu-Ray in mind. Not saying that if they used Retas pro it could not be upscaled properly, and I don't mean upscaled in the video mastering sense i mean the animation drawings would have to be resized and still new masters would have to be made. Its really unlikely at that we are going to see a legit blu-ray at this point regardless. The Japanese Blu-ray is out, its beyond hidiouse looking, its a fuzzy mess, and it was produced by Gainax. You can find screen shots of it, but really don't bother with this.Now that the US Funi blu-ray is out, all this is confirmed, This release is a blurry mes, it was a Q-Tec type upscale and looks like crayon.here are some screen caps @ 1080P[...]",1,FLCL Blu-Ray Upscale,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,1165,"['Okay', 'look', 'FLCL', 'awesome', 'Gainax', 'OVA', 'late', ""90's-"", 'erly', '2000', 'denying', 'point', 'rating', 'however', 'upcoming', 'blu-ray', 'not', 'show', 'general', 'anyone', 'hog-wild', 'trolling', 'review', 'do', 'homework', 'not', 'true', 'Blu-Ray', 'quality', 'master', 'FLCL', 'existence', 'time', 'period', 'Japanese', 'masters', 'show', 'were', 'scaled', 'rendered', '480p', '1999-2000', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'production', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'Blu-Ray', 'mind', 'Not', 'saying', 'used', 'Retas', 'pro', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'upscaled', 'properly', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'upscaled', 'video', 'mastering', 'sense', 'i', 'mean', 'animation', 'drawings', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'resized', 'still', 'new', 'masters', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'really', 'unlikely', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'legit', 'blu-ray', 'point', 'regardless', 'Japanese', 'Blu-ray', 'out', 'hidiouse', 'looking', 'fuzzy', 'mess', 'was', 'produced', 'Gainax', 'can', 'find', 'screen', 'shots', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'this.Now', 'US', 'Funi', 'blu-ray', 'out', 'confirmed', 'release', 'blurry', 'mes', 'was', 'Q-Tec', 'type', 'upscale', 'are', 'screen', 'caps', '@', '1080P', '[', ']']",FLCL: The Complete Series

1397216,A3HXZPCBEYA22N,B004DMIIPA,Deviation,"[155, 163]","FLCL, or Fooly Cooly is standard definition digital animation. As such, you'll never see a true HD presentation for this wonderful show. This Blu-ray Disc is an upscale of the SD material.What's the benefit then to owning this show on BD instead of DVD? Artifacts. I own the original SyncPoint DVDs. Despite only having two episodes per disc and being derived from a digital master, those DVDs are ridden with very visible and distracting macroblocking and mosquito noise. It's a matter of how old the discs are and how inefficient the MPEG-2 codec is.This BD presentation of FLCL is not perfect. It's been sharpened a bit, so the line work stands out a bit more than I think it's supposed to. The colors are also more saturated than they were on the DVDs and I found it a bit distracting. Aliasing is present, but that's unavoidable with SD material. The aliasing is far worse on the DVDs.Despite being an imperfect upscale of SD source material, the BD for Fooly Cooly is by far the best available presentation we have stateside thanks to the elimination of artifacts and the reduction in aliasing. And at the friendly pricing (the whole series for the same price as what a single one of the three DVDs used to cost) here on Amazon, there's no reason at all to avoid this release.Oh, and the lossless stereo track is wonderful.

1397217,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,B004DMIIPA,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[18, 114]","[Updated February 24, 2011]The first and only time I saw FLCL was back in the summer of 2003.  Back then, I thought it was the absolute worst anime of all time because the visual styles and characters really got on my nerves.  I realized I was a little on an ""anger high"" when I posted my first draft of my review, hence the revised one you're reading now.  I also realize that FLCL doesn't exactly fall in line with my typical diet in anime (the dark and serious stuff), but even taking that mentality out, I just don't find it all that enjoyable.STORYThe story to FLCL is that it's a coming-of-age story about a boy named Naota who lives in a city with a giant teapot that he considers boring, then a girl riding on a Vespa named Haruko comes in to town and bashes his head with a bass guitar, then his life turns upside down because robots are popping out of his head and aliens among other things are running amok in the city.CHARACTERSI found the characters in FLCL, other than Naota, to be either extremely annoying or impossible to connect with.  The best example of the ""annoying"" characters by far is Haruko.  All I really remember her doing in the show (I saw this show only once back in 2003) is that she runs around screaming and destroying everything with her bass guitar.  I found the other characters in the show, such as Naota's brother's girlfriend and his dad, largely impossible to connect with because instead of subtle moments to allow proper character development.  After some revelations provided from another anime fan, the idiotic and annoying characterizations are supposed to be a huge slam against typical otaku mentality, I just think there could have been much better ways to do this because it robbed much enjoyment I could have had.JUST PICK ONE OR THE OTHERAfter some insight from a good friend of mine more knowledgeable about FLCL than I am, I admit my original assessment of the show mixing a coming-of-age story with loud and over-the-top comedy was off the mark.  I now realize that the over-the-top comedy and horrendously convoluted subplots were all deliberate parodies of the worst anime cliches.  That would have been perfectly fine with me if the show was all about making fun of these cliches, but the combination of the parodies with a legitimate story feels very, very awkward to me.COMEDY WITHOUT THE LAUGHSNow even with the points above in mind, you're probably saying ""Can't you just enjoy the comedy in the show and forgive any shortcomings?""  Yes, I probably could, if I actually enjoyed the humor in the show.  Honestly, most of FLCL's humor feels much like half-baked Excel Saga jokes.  While Excel Saga has some spotty moments, I think it's one of comedic anime's high points because not only was it funny (something many comedic anime titles fail at doing, like the horrendously overblown Tenchi Muyo), and felt more refreshing because it was all about ""fun and games"".  The humor itself in FLCL ranges from being painfully grating or really lukewarm in-jokes about anime.  The in-jokes and cultural references were out-of-place within the episodes, and even at a younger age in my years of anime fandom, spotted them miles away.  Har har har, there's a scene where Haruko imitates part of the opening credits to the 70's anime Lupin III, that's some clever stuff there!!  Ooh look, there's a scene with some random South Park-style animation, how genius!!  The previously mentioned anime in-jokes all fall into the ""random"" humor that Excel Saga (mostly) had down to a science, the humor in FLCL feels like half-baked versions of the source material, and it came off more as irritating than anything else (I honestly think FLCL's humor is on par with SpongeBob Squarepants, another unfunny cartoon).  Some people have said to me that the humor has some things to say about the cliches typical in anime, and it probably does, but whatever ""insight"" it can offer is negated by the fact that the anime feels more like an insanity test than a brain-twister.APPEARANCEThe appearance of FLCL has it's positives and negatives, though mostly negatives.  It's obvious that FLCL was a higher-budget production given the effort put in to achieve a smooth frame rate and to smoothly draw out the characters and environments.  The negative part of this is that the creators thought it would be the most clever thing in history to mash together a bunch of clashing visual styles and it feels unpleasantly awkward.SOUNDTRACKWhile I don't dislike the soundtrack nearly as much as I used to in previous years, I still find it to be pretty bland.  I honestly found most of the tunes forgettable, but I still remember the music credits made by the Japanese pop rock band The Pillows.  I found the music to be very weak, easy-to-digest power pop that's not catchy or fun to listen to.  I realize that this music isn't typical of what I listen to (thrash and death metal), but I can appreciate well-made music that's pleasant to listen to, even if it's not a genre I'm into.  For example, I thought the opening theme to Bubblegum Crash had delightfully catchy melodies and was overall pleasant to listen to, despite it being J-pop.  The Pillows' theme music for FLCL reminds me too much of West Coast pop-punk bands like Green Day, which I can honestly find very little to like about.FINAL WORDFLCL could have been a brilliant and much-needed slam against the worst anime cliches, if that's all it aspired to do, but the fact that the humor was overstayed and half-baked, and that the incorporation of a coming-of-age story really makes it feel unpleasantly weird and badly executed.  Gainax's weird methods of animated storytelling really don't sit well with me, but that's just my opinion.  If you want some over-the-top anime comedy, I say just go for some Excel Saga.",1,A weird idea that was terrible executed.  21%,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,5807,"['[', 'Updated', 'February', '24',

1397219,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B004DMIIPA,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[2, 4]","Gainax and Production IG are known for producing some of the most prolific works in anime, between them such titles as ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"", ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", ""Eden of the East"" and ""Gunbuster"". Both of them are brilliant studios in their own right, but like many great things (PB&J;, milk and cookies, Hall & Oates), these two extraordinary talents produce fantastic work when combined. Work that, even eleven years later, continues to influence and inspire modern anime directors, writers and studios. That work is the phenomenally messed-up acid trip that is Fooly Cooly, or FLCL.12 year-old Naota has a comparatively normal life. He hangs out with his older brother's pyromaniac of an ex-girlfriend, carries around a baseball bat for no immediately apparent reason, and lives in a town whose most distinguishing feature is a factory shaped like a jumbo-sized laundry iron. To him, this is just boring, everyday life, and one that he's sick and tired of. Naota craves change, and shortly into the first episode, he gets it, in the form of a smack to the head by a guitar wielded by a pink-haired girl on a yellow Vespa. This is not a typical beginning to an anime hero's tale, needless to say.And that's what makes FLCL so great: it's unconventional approach to typical storytelling conventions. After his fateful encounter with the pink-haired Vespa girl, named Haruko Haruhara, Naota begins his path to manhood. However, this path is one paved with robots bursting forth from his head, with Haruko's non-stop maniacal antics, and with Earth-saving baseball home runs. Nothing is as you expect it to be in FLCL, and quite frankly, that's why fans still adore it to this day.In many works of a similar nature, we'd see an insecure boy growing into maturity by piloting a giant robot, while falling for a cute, demure alien woman, and excising inner demons by fighting the forces of evil. This world, though, has no defined sense of good or bad, has the furthest thing from a ""cute"" or ""demure"" woman, and features a robot that first appears as a rectangular zit on Naota's forehead. By showing us the opposite of what we expect from this show, Gainax and IG succeeded where so many studios have failed: authentically capturing a boy's movement through puberty. Every bit of FLCL's world is a personification of Naota's insecurities, shortcomings, doubts, fears, and sexual frustrations, blown up to often grotesque macros in order for the viewer to understand them. In doing this, the two studios crafted something that is altogether brilliant and groundbreaking.But don't let that serious-sounding analysis fool you into thinking this series isn't a riotous good time as well. Gags, of both the verbal and visual variety, come flying at the viewer at almost breakneck speeds, and can confuse those who aren't keeping their eyes absolutely glued to the screen. That's not hard to do, though, when what you're watching is animation of the highest caliber, bright colors in vivid detail with fluid animation oozing from every second of this series. Many current anime series actually look rather pedestrian compared to the beautiful world presented to us here.On the audio side of things, we have what is perhaps one of the best soundtracks recorded for ANYTHING, let alone an anime. Instead of creating an orchestral score, or a bubbly array of synth waves, the producers told J-Garage group The Pillows to get into a studio and go absolutely wild. They did just that, and created music that fits in all the right places. Distorted guitar riffs and vocals highlight intense moments, and fist-pumping alt-garage ballads punctuate big battles sequences. Never once does the music feel out of place, a rare feat for any soundtrack.Now, I will admit I have only seen a BIT of the Japanese dub, as well as listened to the FLCL radio dramas, but both times I watched the series (first on Adult Swim way back when I was a kid, then in this edition) in English. The dub here is unchanged from Synch Point's initial dubbing, but that's not really something one can fault. Despite some necessary re-doing of Japanese language puns, the English dub matches the frantic energy of the original Japanese, and then some. From what I have seen, I would recommend watching in both languages for unique experiences, which I plan to do, but would also say that you're going to have a good time either way.FUNImation wisely has stopped using their typical thin paper boxes with slim-pak DVD cases in recent releases, giving us instead one hard plastic container with a glossy slipcase. This is much better for aesthetic appeal on shelves, and all-in-all makes it feel like FUNI has actually started listening to customer complaints about box creasing and whatnot.""FLCL"" is one of those rare shows that is perfect in every conceivable way. You will not walk away from this series with a single complaint, nor will you overly-scrutinize the contents within the show, simply because everything is laid bare for a viewer to take away what they want to. It is arguably more of a triumph than ""Evangelion"" (one of my personal favorites), for it doesn't bog itself down with extraneous details that ultimately serve to add a perfunctory layer of faux-depth. This show has many messages, but not so many that it feels tedious at time. Perhaps the greatest lesson one can learn from Naota and Haruko is to learn by cutting loose and having fun.And that is possibly how ""FLCL"" is best viewed: with a laid-back and adventurous mindset.Plot: A+Video: A+Audio: A+Packaging: A+Overall: A+ (Must-Buy)",5,A Head Trip of Cosmic Proportions,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,5597,"['Gainax', 'Production', 'IG', 'are', 'known',

1397221,A29GGWB3GGQBO9,B004DMIIPA,GPeralta,"[1, 1]","FLCL is probably one of the strangest series you will have watched. Ever. Though as confusing as its plot can be at times, it never gets ridiculously convoluted, knowing just the right limit to push its viewers to make them think ""yeah, I don't get it, but if I watch it enough times, I probably will."" And considering that it's only five episodes long, you very well can (and should!) do such.For the uninitiated, FLCL pretty much defined an era of anime fans that would have otherwise been completely dominated by the likes of Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon. And unlike studio Gainax's other hit at the time (Evangelion), it doesn't take itself too seriously (or seriously at all, for that matter); while Evangelion told the coming of age story in the most pretentious way possible, FLCL takes things in the completely opposite direction, telling the same story in the most ridiculous zany way possible. You may not get everything at first, but with a few more watches, you'll start to notice little bits and pieces that tie together each episode. And even if you don't, that's what the episode commentaries for each episode are for.Besides the commentary tracks, there are also music tracks from The Pillows, whose Japanese Rock tunes permeate the entire series along with the music video for the series closing credits theme - ""Ride On Shooting Star."" One minor complaint is that the music video seems to be in widescreen, but doesn't adjust for widescreen televisions, making the footage surrounded by black bars on all sides. Other than that, though, the extras alone make up for paying around $20 for a 5-episode series.As for those wondering about picking up the Blu-Ray versus sticking to the DVD version: The series was made in 2000, so I wouldn't consider the footage nice enough to warrant paying the extra for the BR version. However, other reviewers have stated that the BR footage in this release is different from the apparently horrendous BR footage used in the original Japanese BR release, so there's always that to consider. At the end of the day, though, I'd say stick to the DVD version; the animation is nice... but it isn't *that* nice.",5,Requires multiple watches to get it... but it's worth it.,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,2157,"['FLCL', 'probably', 'one', 'strangest', 'series', 'will', 'have', 'watched', 'Ever', 'Though', 'as', 'confusing', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'times', 'never', 'ridiculously', 'convoluted', 'knowing', 'just', 'right', 'limit', 'push', 'viewers', 'make', 'think', 'yeah', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'enough', 'times', 'probably', 'will', 'considering', 'only', 'five', 'episodes', 'long', 'very', 'well', 'can', 'should', 'do', 'such.For', 'uninitiated', 'FLCL', 'pretty', 'much', 'defined', 'era', 'anime', 'fans', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'completely', 'dominated', 'likes', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'studio', 'Gainax', 'other', 'hit', 'time', 'Evangelion', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'seriously', 'matter', 'Evangelion', 'told', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'most', 'pretentious', 'way', 'possible', 'FLCL', 'things', 'completely', 'opposite', 'direction', 'telling', 'same', 'story', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'zany', 'way', 'possible', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'everything', 'first', 'few', 'more', 'watches', ""'ll"", 'start', 'notice', 'little', 'bits', 'pieces', 'tie', 'together', 'episode', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'what', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'episode', 'are', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'also', 'music', 'tracks', 'Pillows', 'Japanese', 'Rock', 'tunes', 'permeate', 'entire', 'series', 'music', 'video', 'series', 'closing', 'credits', 'theme', 'Ride', 'Shooting', 'Star', 'One', 'minor', 'complaint', 'music', 'video', 'be', 'widescreen', ""n't"", 'adjust', 'widescreen', 'televisions', 'making', 'footage', 'surrounded', 'black', 'bars', 'sides', 'Other', 'though', 'extras', 'alone', 'make', 'up', 'paying', 'around', '20', '5-episode', 'series.As', 'wondering', 'about', 'picking', 'up', 'Blu-Ray', 'versus', 'sticking', 'DVD', 'version', 'series', 'was', 'made', '2000', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'footage', 'nice', 'enough', 'warrant', 'paying', 'extra', 'BR', 'version', 'However', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'BR', 'footage', 'release', 'different', 'apparently', 'horrendous', 'BR', 'footage', 'used', 'original', 'Japanese', 'BR', 'release', 'always', 'consider', 'end', 'day', ""'d"", 'say', 'stick', 'DVD', 'version', 'animation', 'nice', ""n't"", '*that*', 'nice']",FLCL: The Complete Series

1397223,A12LDQSV5JEN44,B004DMIIPA,Hunter,"[0, 0]","FLCL is an anime series without form or focus.  It is the animated ramblings of a madman.  It doesn't go weird for the sake of being weird, it isn't style over substance.  It's mental.  That would be a good way to describe the show: it goes mental.  Not ""it goes mental for the sake of being mental"" but just ""it goes mental"" because FLCL does not at any point offer a qualifier for what it does.  That is its strength: that it never feels the need to justify itself and never becomes self aware.The series is about an apathetic sixth grader, Naota, who while fooling around with his brother's girlfriend is run over by a Vespa driving by a pink-haired crazy woman, Haruko, who has nothing with her except a chainsaw shotgun bass guitar.  Thus opening the flood gates to a plot of alien conspiracy, giant robots, sports philosophy, and sexual misconduct.  The flood gates being Haruko herself as she creates impossible situations through the simplest of means.  The plot itself, caused by Haruko, never really starts and never really stops.  It just kind of happens.  And it happens loud and fast.Haruko, being the instigator of all the major events, is where FLCL teeters on the edge of being completely fascinating and completely unwatchable.  At a flick of the wrist, and often times faster than that, she will completely change her attitude, disposition, and even personality.  This means that the main driving force behind the story is totally undefined.  In fact, all of the characters exist in an undefined state.  All of them can be described but not in any human sounding way.  The only one who is somewhat relatable and definable is Naota but even then he is so emotionally detached that it almost doesn't even matter.The animation style of FLCL is just about as indefinable as its plot and characters.  It's always bouncing around and changing from one to another.  Going from 3-D animation to a manga style and even to the animation style of South Park with an almost gleeful zeal.  It looks how it feels it should look and sometimes looks how it feels it shouldn't look.  All of the styles work in some way and as a result FLCL is one of the most visually interesting anime series I've ever come across.Despite being a ""series without form or focus"", constantly changing animation styles, and having undefined characters it never feels like it is rattling keys in your face.  That's thanks in no small part to its short runtime of six episodes.  Any longer and it would have been near insufferable after a while.  There are also enough slow quite moments to keep momentum going without it being exhausting to watch.  In fact it is one of the most fun series to watch despite being objectively awful in terms of writing.  But that right there could be what makes it great.  Yes, great, despite how it sounded like I was ragging on it most of the review.Does it mean anything?  I have a few theories but how much does it really matter?  I don't know.  Then again what do I know?  Not much.

1397232,A2C2T9R7V2LRLJ,B004DMIIPA,Lazar,"[0, 0]","How does one review FLCL, accurately describe its plot and appeal, and not sound ludicrously insane?  When I first asked my spouse what FLCL was ""about,"" she said, ""It's about a kid who has a robot come out of his head.""  WHAT??  My point exactly.  It's like trying to describe Midori Days: ""It's about a guy whose hand turns into a cute girl from the waist up.""  It really makes no sense; if anything, it makes your friends think you are some kind of weirdo or pervert.So--FLCL.  In defense of the love of my life, FLCL isn't really about a robot busting out of a kid's head.  That description comes close to capturing the main plot device in a short sentence, but FLCL is really a coming-of-age story about the magic of first love.  Every one of us remembers our first crush--maybe it was on someone in our year, or perhaps someone older.  For those of us in the latter category, maybe it was a brother or sister's best friend, or the scruffy senior who sat in the back of our 11th grade algebra class.  Maybe it was the cute doctor or lawyer from career day.  Whatever.  There is a certain amount of awkwardness, shyness, and (in retrospect) hilarity that accompanies those years, and FLCL nails this.  Is FLCL about nostalgia?  Is it about looking back at our childhood through a colored lens (or rather, through a kaleidoscope) and seeing what we want to see?  Is it about trying to understand what it means to realize you really aren't a kid anymore but you still aren't old enough to drive and make real decisions?  I think so.For all of its intelligence--and I stand by that statement: FLCL is a smart anime--FLCL might have tanked without Haruko.  In a series that aims to give us fresh, uncliched characters, Haruko is a total cipher.  To write her off as a magical girlfriend does not do her justice; we almost never know what she's really thinking, what she really feels, or what her agenda really is.  It's this mix of uncertainty, zaniness, and alien impenetrability that brings me back to FLCL over and over again.I've unfortunately seen FLCL undermined and abused by viewers who either did not appreciate its humor or did not understand its story, which is a real shame, because both are excellent.  FLCL is frenetic and fast-paced, and requires more than one viewing to fully comprehend.  Contrary to popular dismissals, there is a story here; I still watch it today and notice things I missed before, and the comedy is always as fresh as the first viewing.If you are viewing FLCL for the first time, don't be concerned about not understanding the first two or three episodes.  You will receive a helpful bit of exposition later, which will put the previous episodes in context and contribute to a great second viewing.  Instead, try to enjoy FLCL for what it is: a sweet, coming-of-age comedy with robots.",5,"""I saw God the other day, by the river on a rainy afternoon.""",1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,2823,"['How', 'one', 'review', 'FLCL', 'accurately', 'describe', 'plot', 'appeal', 'not', 'sound', 'ludicrously', 'insane', 'When', 'first', 'asked', 'spouse', 'what', 'FLCL', 'was', 'said', 'kid', 'who', 'robot', 'come', 'head', 'WHAT', 'point', 'exactly', 'trying', 'describe', 'Midori', 'Days', 'guy', 'hand', 'cute', 'girl', 'waist', 'up', 'really', 'sense', 'anything', 'friends', 'think', 'are', 'kind', 'weirdo', 'pervert.So', 'FLCL', 'defense', 'love', 'life', 'FLCL', ""n't"", 'really', 'robot', 'busting', 'kid', 'head', 'description', 'close', 'capturing', 'main', 'plot', 'device', 'short', 'sentence', 'FLCL', 'really', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'magic', 'first', 'love', 'one', 'remembers', 'first', 'crush', 'maybe', 'was', 'someone', 'year', 'perhaps', 'someone', 'older', 'latter', 'category', 'maybe', 'was', 'brother', 'sister', 'best', 'friend', 'scruffy', 'senior', 'who', 'sat', 'back', '11th', 'grade', 'algebra', 'class', 'Maybe', 'was', 'cute', 'doctor', 'lawyer', 'career', 'day', 'certain', 'amount', 'awkwardness', 'shyness', 'retrospect', 'hilarity', 'years', 'FLCL', 'FLCL', 'nostalgia', 'looking', 'back', 'childhood', 'colored', 'lens', 'rather', 'kaleidoscope', 'seeing', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'realize', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'kid', 'anymore', 'still', 'are', ""n't"", 'old', 'enough', 'drive', 'make', 'real', 'decisions', 'think', 'so.For', 'intelligence', 'stand', 'statement', 'FLCL', 'smart', 'anime', 'FLCL', 'might', 'have', 'tanked', 'Haruko', 'series', 'give', 'fresh', 'uncliched', 'characters', 'Haruko', 'total', 'cipher', 'write', 'off', 'magical', 'girlfriend', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'almost', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'thinking', 'what', 'really', 'feels', 'what', 'agenda', 'really', 'mix', 'uncertainty', 'zaniness', 'alien', 'impenetrability', 'back', 'FLCL', 'again.I', ""'ve"", 'unfortunately', 'seen', 'FLCL', 'undermined', 'abused', 'viewers', 'who', 'either', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'story', 'real', 'shame', 'are', 'excellent', 'FLCL', 'frenetic', 'fast-paced', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'Contrary', 'popular', 'dismissals', 'story', 'here', 'still', 'watch', 'today', 'notice', 'things', 'missed', 'comedy', 'always', 'as', 'fresh', 'first', 'viewing.If', 'are', 'viewing', 'FLCL', 'first', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'concerned', 'not', 'understanding', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'will', 'receive', 'helpful', 'bit', 'exposition', 'later', 'will', 'put', 'previous', 'episodes', 'context', 'contribute', 'great', 'second', 'viewing', 'Instead', 'try', 'enjoy', 'FLCL', 'what', 'sweet', 'coming-of-age', 'comedy', 'robots']",FLCL: The Complete Series

1397243,AJQG1NUK01SV4,B004DMIIPA,Ranakabuto,"[16, 18]","After the existential gore-fest that was ""End of Evangelion"", Studio Gainax decided to do something a little less... traumatizing.  First they tried making the TV show ""His and Her Circumstances,"" but the author of the shojo manga on which it was based threw a hissy fit over their comedic adaptation and it was cancelled after the first season.  So they went and made FLCL, which is both a return to form for Gainax and a bold new presentation in the world of anime.What is it about?  Well, in the typical Gainax fashion the story is not that straightforward and rather convoluted, but let's at least try to get the basics out of the way anyway.  Naota, a typical 12 year old grade-schooler, is hanging out with his older brother's horny delinquent girlfriend when a strange pink-haired woman on a Vespa scooter runs him over, gives him CPR and then whacks him upside the head with her Rickenbacker bass guitar right before moving into his house with his family.  Afterward things start getting very strange for our hero as robots start springing out of his head and he starts getting confusing feelings for Haruko, the weird, bass-wielding alien lady responsible for all of his troubles.  It doesn't make a lot of sense, but it is a lot of fun.And this anime IS a lot of fun - FLCL manages to blend surreal comedy and drama and present it at a good, quick pace.  And a warning to those of a more conventional mindset:  this anime is *weird*, with jokes and non sequiturs coming out of the blue to hit you square in the face with oddity after cartoon oddity.  This is just what a group of animators needs to make after having to grimly animate teenage girls being eaten alive by giant gruesome killer cyborgs.  FLCL is a return to Gainax making anime as a group of anime *fans,* with the patented Gainax Homage Method in full play for the first time since 1988's ""Gunbuster"":  parody an anime trope, celebrate it, then turn it up to 11.  And just like in that seminal sci-fi OVA from the previous decade, Gainax's love of animation is on full display here:  all sorts of techniques are employed to give FLCL a real kinetic quality, a sense of *life*.  Gainax's love of anime and animation in general comes through every frame, every shot of every quick gag, every classic anime reference, every fight scene, every application of a lovingly rendered vintage guitar to the head of a giant rampaging robot.  In short, FLCL is glorious.However, what makes FLCL stand out is not only the great animation (because after all, well animated garbage is still garbage) or the great comedy - it's also the dramatic themes running through the show.  FLCL is basically about sex and growing up, and how both will screw you up.  Far too many TV shows and movies with a ""coming of age"" theme don't sit well with me as they usually seem too sentimental and not real enough.  Kazuya Tsurumaki accomplishes something amazing here:  he imbues this OVA with a wistful, nostalgic quality; at the same time he shows how much adolescence suuuuuucks.  Speaking as a male who has made it through puberty (thankfully quite a while ago) I can say that I identified with Naota while watching this: having your body do weird things and feeling an increasing confusion for the world around you is not fun.  And having weird feelings for women is not fun either (actually, it's still not fun).  Haruko is the perfect symbol of how women seem to boys Naota's age:  strange, infuriating, indecipherable, and yet strangely interesting and enticing.  At one point she examines an X-Ray of our hero and declares that his brain is missing - all the while a massive horn (hmm...) is sticking out the back of his skull.  Yeah, being a teenage boy feels like that - all hormones and no head.  Tsurumaki also doesn't give any pat endings or solutions: I won't spoil anything but I will say that Naota does not have a completely hunky dory super happy ending (although it *is* a happy ending - this is not Eva).This new Funimation DVD of FLCL is very nice indeed.  Although it does not have all of the special features of the previous Synch-Point release, it does fit all 6 episodes onto one disc - meaning no swapping out discs after every two episodes like that previous 3 disc version.  This makes shotgunning FLCL in one sitting a little bit easier (providing of course that you can handle that much FLCL in one sitting - I can!).  Video is good:  presented in the original aspect ratio of 4:3 and free of any obvious defects.  Audio is also good, if not earthshattering with both the original Japanese and the English dub presented in 2 channel stereo.  Speaking of the English dub, the one on this disc is surprisingly good.  I normally don't watch anime in English but the dub for FLCL impressed me.  In fact, I think it can enhance one's enjoyment of this particular series as FLCL is a highly kinetic show, and reading subtitles can distract from the barrage of images on the screen.  I caught some visual details on the second viewing in English that I missed the first time in Japanese.Special features include a director's commentary for all 6 episodes (interesting tidbit: the Vespa in the end credits is actually Tsurumaki's) which is worth listening to once.  A warning though that you have to watch the commentaries for each individual episode one at a time - there is no ""watch all"" commentary option.  Also included: English dub outtakes (nonessential), textless ending and some music videos with tunage from the show by the Pillows (the Japanese rock band that supplied the unique soundtrack), in addition to the standard trailers for other stuff by Funimation.  The only downside is that the packaging for FLCL is nothing special: a thin cardboard slipcase housing a clear standard single-disc DVD case.  The case is a bit flimsy, actually.  It seems like everyone is moving towards using the ""eco-friendly"" lighter cases nowadays and Funimation unfortunately is no exception.  If you want something sturdier to put your disc into you're going to have to replace the case.Pluses - Very, very fun!  Great story, great animation, good music, a joyous return to form for Gainax and a chance to get their ya-yas out after the grisly Anno angst-fest that was ""Evangelion.""Minuses - May be too weird and convoluted for some.Conclusion - This is a classic, truly creative anime made by people who love anime and love making anime.  I recommend this highly for anyone who is a fan of Gainax, as well as anyone who likes off-the-wall anime in general.  If you like this I recommend Nobuhiko Obayashi'sHouseand the BBC sitcomThe Young Oneswhich are in the same vein.  In fact, it was watching these that immunized me so that I was prepared for the insanity of FLCL!",5,"FLCL, Fooly Cooly, Furi Kuri... Furry Curry.......

1397246,A94NOJCJCI6PB,B004DMIIPA,Sean,"[0, 1]","FLCL is the single strangest piece of animation I've ever seen, period. What makes it so strange is not just the plot, but the characters, the setting, the animation, the sound: everything about this anime makes about as much sense as...well, nothing. It's not totally incoherent and you can follow the plot, but new plot threads are introduced every episode and whatever the plot actually is, it just doesn't matter because by the end, your mind is blown.I can't even rate the story of this show because I'm too confused by it. I don't want to give the story a good or bad rating though because I don't want you to either be turned off or turned on to this anime without good reason. If you haven't seen this yet it's a toughie to suggest it just based on the plot. If you are looking for coherence, don't look at this. But if you are looking for a story written by a group of people presumably snorting coke or smoking weed, then take a look at this.The animation is surprisingly stylized and neat. Environments aren't the most detailed but are still enjoyable. Character design is pretty good. One of the big things about this anime is that parts of it are in manga form, there's a part done a la South Park. These two parts are well done and hilarious.FLCL has one of the best ending themes ever. The music is great, a lot of Japanese rock that fits in great with everything. The American voice actors all do a good job. Not much to complain about in this section.The characters of the show are somewhat generic except for Haruko who steals the show, as she should. Takune, as the main character, is just too boring and stoic and while all the random stuff happening to him is funny, the genericism of his character never provides laughs from his end. Haruko, in other words, pretty much holds the show together and drags it along. Which is sad, the only other character who provides enough laughs and enough likability to even be given a second though is a guy with large eyebrows that everyone makes fun of.Takune's father is pretty funny too, but he isn't around enough. I wish he were onscreen a lot more often.This is the kind of show that makes you wonder what the heck Gainax was thinking when they decided to make it. Not that that's a bad thing, the six episodes of this show are all more memorable then animes fifty times as long. It's characters aren't all great, but Haruko will definately stay with you long after the shows finish and the insanity of it all will stay with you. There are very few anime that are like this, and this may be the only anime of it's kind. For much more refined comedy that makes fun of Gainax, anime, and Japanese society overall, watch FLCL. While Gainax newest attempt at comedy, Panty and Stocking, is another anime like this that you may have watched, FLCL just has a much different feel.Watch FLCL.

It isn't that the storyline is particularly brilliant (it is crazy and, oddly, rather simple), but this is first class anime. Naota's whirlwind coming of age experience echoes Shinji's Freudian crisis in Evangelion without being all consuming. The action and animation shows the vividness and edginess of Gurran Lagan, but with more innovation and creativity and insanity. The soundtrack - one long rock and roll trip - fits the mood and, honestly, is just damn good music. The animation is stunning and has few comparisons. Scenes like Haruko's appearance are brilliantly entertaining and it requires a few watches just to take in all the aspects of the art. This is great anime and pushes the limits and flexing the considerable muscle of the genre.Another interesting subtext to the series - embedded in the coming of age story - is the simple question of what it means to come of age. The adults in this film are, by and large, not very adult - scenes like Ninamori's interactions with her father's mistress and any scene involving the mess that is Naota's father bring out, strongly, the ways one can fail to come of age.
