In the beginning of the DVD, they play many hits and many songs you've probably never heard before (but they're still really, really good). And the performance just keeps getting better. Once the rain starts, this 4th of July celebration truly becomes a gem. A must have for any Goo Goo Dolls fan or person who enjoys watching concerts. 5 stars awarded and 6 stars deserved.",5,Superb concert,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,494,"['DVD', 'amazing', 'band', 'set', 'list', 'venue', 'Every', 'song', 'joy', 'hear', 'chemistry', 'stage', 'great', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'play', 'many', 'hits', 'many', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'never', 'heard', ""'re"", 'still', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'performance', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'rain', '4th', 'July', 'celebration', 'truly', 'gem', 'must', 'have', 'Goo', 'Goo', 'Dolls', 'fan', 'person', 'who', 'watching', 'concerts', '5', 'stars', 'awarded', '6', 'stars', 'deserved']",N/A
