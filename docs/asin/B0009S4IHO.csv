Krueger,"[4, 4]","Sony seems more interested in preventing you from copying their DVDs, than they are creating a menu / case art that actually matches the content of the set. Nearly every menu and liner note is incorrect. It is quite annoying if you are attempting to find a certain episode. One of the reasons I purchased this set was because others said that there were a couple of season three episodes included... Particularly, ""Carnal Knowledge,"" which was one of my all time favorites (as a fan of Heather Locklear."" Well if that episode was included in this set (by mistake or otherwise), it has been removed, now. I don't blame Sony for that - the joke is on me!I will rent instead of buying in the future...",3,Excellent video  quality - Poor execution,1179446400,"05 18, 2007",2007,698,"['Sony', 'more', 'interested', 'preventing', 'copying', 'DVDs', 'are', 'creating', 'menu', '/', 'case', 'art', 'actually', 'content', 'set', 'Nearly', 'menu', 'liner', 'note', 'incorrect', 'quite', 'annoying', 'are', 'attempting', 'find', 'certain', 'episode', 'One', 'reasons', 'purchased', 'set', 'was', 'others', 'said', 'were', 'couple', 'season', 'three', 'episodes', 'included', 'Particularly', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'favorites', 'fan', 'Heather', 'Locklear', 'Well', 'episode', 'was', 'included', 'set', 'mistake', 'otherwise', 'been', 'removed', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Sony', 'joke', 'will', 'rent', 'instead', 'buying', 'future']",TJ Hooker - The Complete 1st and 2nd Seasons
911828,ADENUJJYKNHPO,B0009S4IHO,Andrew Salmon,"[3, 5]","I loved this show back in the day! I'm biased because I'm a huge Star Trek/Shatner fan. We hail from the same home town and my dad went to school with the guy. So he's always been a local hero.So when Shatner donned a bluesuit, I was right there from the first episode. And I was pleased to see that the show was really Captain Kirk walking a beat! What a treat back then to be able to tune in and see Kirk in-between Star Trek movies! And the episode with Leonard Nimoy alone is worth the price of the set. Just to see Shatner and Nimoy together outside of Trek is a treat! And George Costanza's Yankee boss is Hooker's boss as well. How about that?Now I know the show is campy and completely unrealistic, but that shouldn't take away from viewer's enjoyment. Shatner loves to deliver speeches about decency and honor and obeying the law. These are great moments and speak a truth people tend to roll their eyes at these days for some reason. This show is fantasy. A fantasy about how cops should be: caring, dedicated, honest, hardworking, part of the community. I know this is all but impossible in the real world, which is why it's nice to see on TV every now and then.Time has aged the show, and this also works in its favor. The clothes, the hair, the crude action sequences. Sure they can't hold a candle to what's being done on television these days (The Shield) but they were state of the art at the time and there is a nostalgic charm to them now. It's funny to watch all of the episode previews all at once and see how many times Hooker/Romano are helping injured people away from vehicles about to blow up. This happens about every 2 or 3 episodes.My only knock against this set is the lack of special features. The lack of these on any set always scream ""cash grab"" to me. Let's get the thing out as cheaply as possible and rake in the profits. This is a shame. Aside from the previews, there's nothing extra. The picture quality is very good, which is nice. But where are the interviews, commentaries, picture gallery, merchandise gallery, etc. This show was a hit don't forget. It got put through the promotional machine just like any other top show. I hope future seasons will have some extras.So if you are looking for some viewing entertainment, then this is the set for you. It's a fantasy, it's charmingly dated, it attempts a Dragnet-like holiness, it's entertaining. It won't change the world but it will provide a few hours of pleasant TV viewing. Nothing wrong with that.",5,Captain Kirk Walks A Beat!,1119139200,"06 19, 2005",2005,2495,"['loved', 'show', 'back', 'day', ""'m"", 'biased', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Star', 'Trek/Shatner', 'fan', 'hail', 'same', 'home', 'town', 'dad', 'went', 'school', 'guy', 'always', 'been', 'local', 'hero.So', 'when', 'Shatner', 'donned', 'bluesuit', 'was', 'right', 'there', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'show', 'was', 'really', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'walking', 'beat', 'What', 'treat', 'back', 'then', 'be', 'able', 'tune', 'see', 'Kirk', 'in-between', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'episode', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'alone', 'price', 'set', 'Just', 'see', 'Shatner', 'Nimoy', 'together', 'Trek', 'treat', 'George', 'Costanza', 'Yankee', 'boss', 'Hooker', 'boss', 'as', 'well', 'How', 'Now', 'know', 'show', 'campy', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'viewer', 'enjoyment', 'Shatner', 'deliver', 'speeches', 'decency', 'honor', 'obeying', 'law', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'speak', 'truth', 'people', 'tend', 'roll', 'eyes', 'days', 'reason', 'show', 'fantasy', 'fantasy', 'how', 'cops', 'should', 'be', 'caring', 'dedicated', 'honest', 'hardworking', 'part', 'community', 'know', 'impossible', 'real', 'world', 'why', 'nice', 'see', 'TV', 'now', 'then.Time', 'aged', 'show', 'also', 'favor', 'clothes', 'hair', 'crude', 'action', 'sequences', 'Sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'what', 'being', 'done', 'television', 'days', 'Shield', 'were', 'state', 'art', 'time', 'nostalgic', 'charm', 'now', 'funny', 'watch', 'episode', 'once', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'Hooker/Romano', 'are', 'helping', 'injured', 'people', 'away', 'vehicles', 'blow', 'up', '2', '3', 'episodes.My', 'only', 'knock', 'set', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'lack', 'set', 'always', 'scream', 'cash', 'grab', 'Let', 'get', 'thing', 'out', 'as', 'cheaply', 'possible', 'rake', 'profits', 'shame', 'Aside', 'previews', 'nothing', 'extra', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'nice', 'where', 'are', 'interviews', 'commentaries', 'picture', 'gallery', 'merchandise', 'gallery', 'etc', 'show', 'was', 'hit', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'got', 'put', 'promotional', 'machine', 'just', 'other', 'top', 'show', 'hope', 'future', 'seasons', 'will', 'have', 'extras.So', 'are', 'looking', 'viewing', 'entertainment', 'then', 'set', 'fantasy', 'charmingly', 'dated', 'Dragnet-like', 'holiness', 'entertaining', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'world', 'will', 'provide', 'few', 'hours', 'pleasant', 'TV', 'viewing', 'Nothing', 'wrong']",TJ Hooker - The Complete 1st and 2nd Seasons

911838,AZB4CQ9JZSUQB,B0009S4IHO,Eric Pregosin,"[60, 65]","To me this is one of the best cop shows I have ever seen.  The star is William Shatner as Sergeant Thomas John Hooker (you only hear his name in one episode which guest stars Vic Tayback so watch for it, it should be in THIS set) a former detective who decided (before the series started) to turn in his gold shield and put his uniform back on to train some raw academy recruits.  At the end of the 90 minute pilot, those who remain in the class get assigned veteran officers as partners and hit the streets.  One of these rookies (ironically the best in the class) Vince Romano (Adrian Zmed) lucks out and gets partnered with Hooker, and thus begins our series.  Throughout the 4 or 5 episodes of Season 1 and all of Season 2 (the first FULL season), stories revolve around Romano learning there is more to learn on the streets than what you learn in training, Hooker spending time with his family (ex wife Fran, a nurse, younguns Chrissy and Tommy and high school age Cathy, who works part time as a candy striper at the same hospital as her mom), Romano making goo goo eyes at the girl dispatcher (Vicki Taylor played by April Clough in the VERY SHORT first season or Stacy Sheridan (Heather Locklear) who happens to be the precinct Captain Dennis Sheridan (Richard Herd)'s daughter), Hooker training more rookies (with Romano as his aide), and more.  After the contents of this set (perhaps the Season 2 finale), Stacy graduates and gets partnered with another veteran Jim Corrigan (played by James Darren).  After a rocky start (ala the Adam 12 series premiere) Stacy and Jim become a partnership, and the remainder of the series (which will hit dvd soon I hope) they run tag team with Hooker and Romano.  Although, James Darren appears on the cover of this set, he does not become a regular til Season 3 (that's why you don't see his name on the box), by then also Captain Sheridan becomes occasional.  Watch in this set for an episode directed by Leonard Nimoy and another one co-starring Nimoy as a lieutenant friend of Hooker who goes off the beam when his daughter is raped.  This was a fixture on the Saturday night ABC lineup from 1982 to 1985 when it mysteriously got cancelled.  It then surfaced on CBS late night in mostly reruns, but a handful of new episodes (minus Adrian Zmed for reasons unknown) were produced.  The show stayed on CBS late night for another year, but by then was pretty much all reruns (from the original ABC run and their (CBS)'s run as well).  Hopefully Columbia will release all the other episodes soon (considering they've stalled on the second and final season of S.W.A.T. who knows).

The first consisted of a mere six episodes; the second ran for a full year.  Set in Los Angeles, this show was originally developed as a vehicle for William Shatner, playing an experienced officer who mentors the younger generation.  The scriptwriting was very uneven at first, although it would improve markedly during the third and fourth seasons.  There were several problems, ranging from poorly-conceived plots to shallow, simplistic characters.  Shatner plays the proverbial tough guy with a heart of gold who spouts anti-crime rhetoric.  His new partner (Adrian Zmed) is portrayed as a frustrated entrepreneur.  The female roles (first April Clough, later Heather Locklear) were completely undeveloped.  Toward the end of the second season, the show would change for the better.  The right-wing rhetoric was abandoned, Heather Locklear's role was expanded, Adrian Zmed's role became more professional, and veteran actor James Darren came on board, creating more of an ensemble cast.

Shatner was amazed at the sensible behavior of the Saddlebreds and their acceptance of all the whoop-de-do going on in their barn.

Thomas Jefferson Hooker(Bill Shatner) who transfers back to patrol to combat more criminals on the streets who also taught cadets at the police academy barracks part-time and had often butted heads with his superior officer Capt. Dennis Sheridan(Richard Herd)and partnered with a young hunky, often short-tempered European rookie patrolman Officer Vince Romano(Adrian Zmed) who was also Hooker's good pal on and off duty , which made them like an upgraded carbon-copy of Los Angeles police Officers Pete Malloy(Martin Milner)& Jim Reed(Kent McCord) on ADAM-12 and also made Hooker & Romano a tad similar to California Highway Patrol Officers Ponch(Erik Estrada) and Jon(Larry Wilcox)on CHiPs.In fact, I used to watch this cop drama every Saturday night on ABC as a kid when it became an instant smash back in the Spring of 1982 when CHiPs was in its 5th Season on NBC & when ABC brought TJ HOOKER back on the air by popular demand for a 2nd Season in September of 1982 just before NBC kicked off CHiPs 6th Season in October of 1982 along with the fact that this police drama also helped make the popular hot blonde bombshell(Heather Locklear) a superstar while Locklear was becoming famous while already playing the sexy Sammy-Jo on DYNASTY at the same time which was of course before Locklear's co-starring days as the sassy bitch(Amanda Woodward)on MELROSE PLACE.T.J. HOOKER was one of the best cop shows of the 80's and probably Bill Shatner's best show and performance since STAR TREK, but I noticed this police drama took a real nose-dive when Romano left the show since it led to a big slump in the ratings, but prior to Romano's departure from TJ HOOKER, this cop drama had gotten even better when Heather Locklear joined the case & crew of the show as Capt. Sheridan's foxy daughter & rookie officer(Stacey Sheridan) in T.J. HOOKER's 2nd Season replacing her predecessor Officer Vicki Taylor(April Clough) and then this police drama improved even more when Stacey's ornery partner Officer Jim Corrigan(James Darren)had joined the cast and crew of the show in the 3rd Season when Capt. Sheridan departed the show, but I'm sure part of what contributed to this shows cancellation in the Spring of 1986 was T.J. HOOKER had started running out of steam when Romano departed the show and when CBS tried to prolong the series in the Fall of 1985 on CBS Crime Time Late Night after ABC had cancelled TJ HOOKER previously in the Summer of 1985.However, I would still have to say that Officer Stacey Sheridan(Heather Locklear)was the real fox of the show and still the best looking character and co-star on TJ HOOKER to this very day as well as the sexiest officer on TV at the time and was even sexier looking than California Highway Patrol Officers Bonnie Clark(Randi Oakes), Sindy Cahill(Brianne Leary), and Kathy Linahan(Tina Gayle)on CHiPs all were, which was probably due to the fact that Heather Locklear was a lot younger than they all were too.I also think Romano and Stacey would've been a great looking couple since Stacey and Romano always seemed to have a chemistry between one another since they often teased and flirted with each other quite a bit during the 2nd thru 4th Seasons of TJ HOOKER, but I'm almost surprised that Romano and Stacey never became an item.Unfortunately, the series tanked after it's 4-year run on ABC when Adrian Zmed left the show after the Spring of 1985 to pursue other projects leaving us mourning the loss of Romano by making TJ HOOKER go from a foursome to only a threesome which left Hooker riding solo without a partner and sometimes even had Hooker working with Sheridan and Corrigan as a 3-officer team instead of a 4-officer team when they didn't have Romano anymore which really sucked, especially in Romano's absence.Something else I noticed about this show was Hooker always seem to run kind of funny during a foot pursuit and could never seem to quite run as well as his other co-stars on this cop drama, especially Romano.Now that Sony has already come out with TJ HOOKER'S first 2 seasons on DVD, I don't see what's taking them so long to bring out the remaining 3 seasons out on DVD, starting with TJ Hooker's 3rd Season, since Sony hasn't even released another season of TJ HOOKER since the Summer of 2005, but I suspect that it may perhaps be due to the fact that this DVD box set didn't sell too good and/or because of today's sluggish economy.However, I would've figured that they would've had the rest of TJ HOOKER's seasons released on DVD by now since TJ HOOKER was such a popular police drama just like CHiPs, ADAM-12, DRAGNET, HUNTER, HILL STREET BLUES, etc.; all were.For instance Universal already has the first 4 seasons of ADAM-12 out on DVD, Warner Bros. already has the first 2 seasons of CHiPs out on DVD, and Anchor Bay already has the first 3 seasons of HUNTER out on DVD.In addition to what baffles me about Sony not having any of the remaining seasons of T.J. HOOKER released on DVD yet, starting with TJ HOOKER's 3rd Season, TJ HOOKER was not only a top 10 show in the early 1980's, T.J. HOOKER even had higher ratings than CHiPs did during TJ HOOKER's first 2 seasons on ABC along with the fact that TJ HOOKER seemed to have stolen some of CHiPs thunder back then,especially since TJ HOOKER was in its honeymoon phase of the show when it made its debut on ABC in March of 1982 while CHiPs honeymoon phase was already long gone along with the fact that between the Fall of 1982 and the Summer of 1983 the Nielsen ratings on TJ HOOKER were still rising at an all-time high while the ratings on CHiPs were sinking to an all-time low, which eventually contributed to NBC cancelling CHiPs in July of 1983.Therefore you could say that TJ HOOKER K.O.'d CHiPs in the ratings along with every other police drama on TV at the time too.In addition to what made TJ HOOKER more popular than CHiPs, TJ HOOKER seemed to be more realistic & more convincing than CHiPs too since Ponch and Jon, nor even any of their fellow Chippies never used their guns or deadly force while busting or pursuing a suspect, unlike Hooker and all his fellow police officers who have sometimes had to even shoot to kill like on ADAM-12, DRAGNET, and HUNTER.Something else that led to CHiPs cancellation while TJ HOOKER's 3rd Season was underway for its 3rd Season in the Fall of 1983 was the departure of Ponch's first partner(California Highway Patrol Officer Jon Baker)who left CHiPs in the Spring of 1982 while CHiPs 6th Season was in the works on NBC and TJ HOOKER's 2nd Season was in the works on ABC for the Fall of 1982 when Stacey replaced previous co-star(April Clough) and when Tom Reilly joined the cast & crew of CHiPs replacing Jon as Ponch's new hot-dog rookie partner(California Highway Patrol Officer Bobby Nelson) since the ratings on CHiPs took a massive nose-dive when Jon left the show & when Bobby came along since Ponch and Bobby didn't have the same kind of chemistry that Ponch and Jon had together along with the fact that Ponch didn't seem to have nearly as much in common with Bobby as he did with Jon either,despite the fact that Larry Wilcox and Erik Estrada didn't get along in real life and had constant rivaly behind the set of CHiPs,which was Larry Wilcox's reason for departing the show in May of 1982, but Wilcox and Estrada were able to patch up their differences and become friends years later before they made the CHiPs reunion movie ""CHiPs 99"",which reminds me that I can't understand why they haven't made a TV reunion movie for TJ HOOKER yet.Something else about this police drama that I never quite understood about this show was what the LCPD stood for since that was the fictional police department that Hooker, Romano, and all their fellow officers worked for since TJ HOOKER obviously took place in Los Angeles just like CHiPs, ADAM-12, DRAGNET, etc.Something else I found baffling about this police drama was I could never understand why Hooker and his fellow officers never wore a Summer uniform, unlike Ponch & Jon on CHiPs & unlike Malloy & McCord on ADAM-12 since Ponch, Jon, McCord, and Malloy along with all their fellow officers always wore their short-sleeved uniforms in the Spring & Summertime which was their Summer uniform, but always wore their long-sleeved uniform in the Fall and Wintertime which was their Winter uniform, but since Hooker & his fellow officers always wore their long-sleeved with a tie uniform only as if the LCPD had a no short-sleeve uniform policy or something, which was kind of odd for a police drama that took place here in Southern California, especially for the L.A. Area where it never even snows either.It was also seeing guest stars like*Eddie Barth in ""The Protectors"" episode during his co-starring days as Rick & AJ's pal(Myron Fowler)on SIMON & SIMON*Barbara Stock in the ""No Time For Love"" episode before her co-starring days on DALLAS & SPENSER FOR HIRE*David Hedison in the pilot episode after his co-starring days on VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA & before his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES & SANTA BARBARA*Thom Christopher in the ""No Time For Love"" episode after his co-starring days as Hawkman on BUCK ROGERS*Richard Moll in the ""Hookers War"" episode before his co-starring days as Judge Stone's baliff(Bull Shannon)on NIGHT COURT*Hal Williams in the pilot episode after his co-starring days on PRIVATE BENJAMIN & before his co-starring days on the sitcom 227*Rebecca Holden in the ""Second Chance"" episode before her co-starring days as KITT's technician(April Curtis)on KNIGHT RIDER from 1983-84.*Vic Tayback in the ""Hookers War"" episode during his co-starring days as Mel on ALICE*James Darren guest starring in the ""King Of The Hill"" episode before his co-starring days as Hooker & Romano's fellow Officer Jim Corrigan on TJ HOOKERs last 3 seasons*Miguel Fernandes in the ""A Cry For Help"" episode before his co-starring days as Grant & Doyle's superior officer(Sgt. Harry Santos)on the NEW ADAM-12*Penny Santon in ""The Protectors"" episode before her co-starring days as Mama Novelli on the detective drama MATT HOUSTON*Herbert Jefferson, Jr. in ""The Empty Gun"" episode after his co-starring days on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA*Michael Cavanaugh in ""The Decoy"" episode before his co-starring days on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS*Betsy Palmer known as the relentless Pamela Voorhees in the original FRIDAY THE 13TH guest starring in the ""Vengence Is Mine"" episode*The Beach Boys doing a cameo in the ""Blind Justice"" episode*Jerry Lee Lewis doing a cameo in the ""Deadly Ambition"" episode*Henry Darrow in the ""A Cry For Help"" episode after his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL & before his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA*Leonard Nimoy reuniting with former co-star Bill Shatner in the ""Vengence Is Mine"" episode after his co-starring days as Mr. Spock on STAR TREK*Jim Brown in the ""Raw Deal"" episode*David Caruso in the ""Requiem For A Cop"" episode before his co-starring days as homicide police investigator(Det. John Kelley) on NYPD BLUE*Lance LeGault in ""The Hostages"" episode before his co-starring days as the bitter Army nemesis(Col.Decker)on THE A-TEAM & during his co-starring days as Magnum's ornery nemesis(Col.Green)on MAGNUM, P.I.*Gary Frank in ""The Streets"" episode after his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITALBy the way, something else intriguing that just occured to me is as luck would have it David Hasselhoff had auditioned for the role of Sgt. T.J. Hooker and had also auditioned for the short-lived STRIKE FORCE in the Winter of 1982, but got rejected from both, but then Hasselhoff eventually got hired for the role of Michael Knight by the Summer of 1982 before KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC in the Autumn of 1982 not that David Hasselhoff wouldn't have made a great TJ Hooker.Additionally, these first 2 seasons of TJ HOOKER take me back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was the president and when I was living in the Imperial Valley growing up in my hometown(El Centro,CA).In the meantime, I can hardly wait till TJ HOOKER's 1983-84 Season gets released on DVD, but I dont see what's taking Sony so long to get Hooker's 3rd Season released, especially since Sony hasn't released any more seasons of TJ HOOKER on DVD since the Summer of 2005, plus I just got word that even CHiPs-Season 3 is already in the works to be released on DVD in June of 2012 which I hope will motivate and prompt Sony to finally get TJ HOOKER's 3rd Season released, especially since Hooker's 3rd and 4th Seasons are even better than Hooker's first 2 seasons on top of that since that's when Corrigan becomes a permanent co-star on this show.",4,TJ HOOKER ROCKS!,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,12796,"['TJ', 'HOOKER', 'was', 'awesome', 'police', 'drama', 'divorced',

Just when you think his career is done he always seems makes a triumphant return in one way or another. T.J. Hooker was just that for Shatner, it resurrected his career in the 1980's and he hasn't stopped since. I've always felt that William Shatner had a sense of arrogance about him in the way he presented himself on screen, but somehow he always managed to make his characters likeable in the end. T.J. Hooker is great 80's television and it's a treat to finally have this show on DVD so I can watch it whenever I want. This set contains the original pilot and all the remaining episodes from seasons 1 & 2 spread out over 6 single sided discs with slim case packaging. The picture and sound are well done and the show is still very entertaining even if it is a little dated. I hope that the remaining seasons are on the way and the Studio doesn't pull another stunt like they did with season one of S.W.A.T. the final season still hasn't been released.The Cast:William Shatner ...Sgt.
