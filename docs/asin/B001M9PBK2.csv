The emphasis of this video is supposed to be about ""fun"" and ""family.""Cons:The instructor is the only person who looks like she's having a genuine good time.There are some random scenes of the family hanging out and the instructor doing yoga poses that just don't fit with what's happening.The pace of the video is pretty quick and there are some fairly difficult yoga poses regarding balance that for a beginner could be dangerous to move so quickly.The animal noises we are supposed to make for the poses are corny and no one in the video actually does them. I really don't know what they are for because they only served to distract me and my son.The video is hacked up into way to many segments, it distracts and gets annoying.Pros:The instructor keeps a smile on her face and tries hard. I would like to see her lead a serious yoga routine.The video is easy to follow seems well made with good lighting and sound.Music is there but not overwhelming you or the instructor's voice.I'm glad we had the chance to just rent this video because it's not a good fit. This video tries hard but lacks that certain quality that could have made it special. Pass on this one.",2,The instructor tries hard but the routine falls flat.,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,1264,"['have', 'been', 'looking', 'ways', 'introduce', 'son', 'Yoga', 'so', 'gave', 'Yoga', 'Families', 'try', 'emphasis', 'video', 'supposed', 'be', 'fun', 'family', 'Cons', 'instructor', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'having', 'genuine', 'good', 'are', 'random', 'scenes', 'family', 'hanging', 'out', 'instructor', 'doing', 'yoga', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'what', 'happening.The', 'pace', 'video', 'pretty', 'quick', 'are', 'fairly', 'difficult', 'yoga', 'poses', 'regarding', 'balance', 'beginner', 'could', 'be', 'dangerous', 'move', 'so', 'quickly.The', 'animal', 'noises', 'are', 'supposed', 'make', 'poses', 'are', 'corny', 'one', 'video', 'actually', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'only', 'served', 'distract', 'son.The', 'video', 'hacked', 'up', 'way', 'many', 'segments', 'annoying.Pros', 'instructor', 'smile', 'face', 'tries', 'hard', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'lead', 'serious', 'yoga', 'routine.The', 'video', 'easy', 'follow', 'well', 'made', 'good', 'lighting', 'sound.Music', 'there', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'instructor', 'voice.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'had', 'chance', 'just', 'rent', 'video', 'not', 'good', 'fit', 'video', 'hard', 'certain', 'quality', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'special', 'Pass', 'one']",Yoga For Families: Connect With Your Kids
