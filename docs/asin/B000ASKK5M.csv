933084,A58BRJPOKGWNN,B000ASKK5M,K A Goode,"[52, 52]","After sitting in Trig class for a month and gleaning little from the professor I ordered and patiently awaited this DVD in hopes that it would help in clearing up topics from Algebra taken over ten years ago. With a full time job and a full time course load there was little time to fit in a traditional tutor and I didn't want to think about the expense.I am very pleased that I ordered the course in addition to the Trig and Pre-Calc tutor falling under the same series. In just an hour of viewing this DVD I understood concepts that neither my professor nor textbook adequately explained to a point where I would gain a level of clarity and confidence.I am certain that I will be using this as well as the other titles in the series with a great degree of regularity as I make my way through this course as well as the remaining math courses left in my program.My only gripe with the DVD are the audio glitches that come and go throughout the program, not many but enough to notice but not enough to stop using the program. Others may not have noticed them but I did because I played the DVD on a home theater system.Even with that glitch I genuinely appreciate the clarity of the program and the ability of the teacher. I even e-mailed the provider with a question and he responded quickly and with a real e-mail not an auto response. That's almost unheard of and coupled with the solid value of the program has certainly won me as a definite endorser of the Math Tutor DVD program(s).No one cares about your education more than you do. Be your own advocate to learning.  This is one of many ways to ensure that you learn the necessary material as well as build skills that you'll need in later courses.",5,Just the Supplement I Needed!,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,1707,"['sitting', 'Trig', 'class', 'month', 'gleaning', 'little', 'professor', 'ordered', 'patiently', 'awaited', 'DVD', 'hopes', 'would', 'help', 'clearing', 'up', 'topics', 'Algebra', 'taken', 'over', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'full', 'time', 'job', 'full', 'time', 'course', 'load', 'was', 'little', 'time', 'fit', 'traditional', 'tutor', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'expense.I', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'ordered', 'course', 'addition', 'Trig', 'Pre-Calc', 'tutor', 'falling', 'same', 'series', 'just', 'hour', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'understood', 'concepts', 'professor', 'textbook', 'adequately', 'explained', 'point', 'where', 'would', 'gain', 'level', 'clarity', 'confidence.I', 'am', 'certain', 'will', 'be', 'using', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'titles', 'series', 'great', 'degree', 'regularity', 'make', 'way', 'course', 'as', 'well', 'remaining', 'math', 'courses', 'left', 'program.My', 'only', 'DVD', 'are', 'audio', 'glitches', 'come', 'go', 'program', 'not', 'many', 'enough', 'notice', 'not', 'enough', 'stop', 'using', 'program', 'Others', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'noticed', 'did', 'because', 'played', 'DVD', 'home', 'theater', 'system.Even', 'glitch', 'genuinely', 'appreciate', 'clarity', 'program', 'ability', 'teacher', 'even', 'e-mailed', 'provider', 'question', 'responded', 'quickly', 'real', 'e-mail', 'not', 'auto', 'response', 'almost', 'unheard', 'coupled', 'solid', 'value', 'program', 'certainly', 'won', 'definite', 'endorser', 'Math', 'Tutor', 'DVD', 'program', '.No', 'one', 'education', 'more', 'do', 'Be', 'own', 'advocate', 'learning', 'one', 'many', 'ways', 'ensure', 'learn', 'necessary', 'material', 'as', 'well', 'build', 'skills', ""'ll"", 'need', 'later', 'courses']",N/A

For kids just learning algebra I think the set will almost guarantee a ""A"" provided one does the work.The instructor is excellent and goes through the stuff step by step.  I also like the fact that this set does not have any patronizing gimmicks but is a straight forward presentation with example after example.I wish my teacher, back in 1958, had this instructor's teaching style when I was first introduced to algebra in Seventh Standard (British system).

933086,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B000ASKK5M,Mike S.,"[4, 4]","First, this is a DVD of a guy standing in front of a white board doing math problems.  It is not going to be the most exciting thing on earth, and depending on how you learn, may or may not be for you.  Second, as the instructor says, he does not cover every topic one is likely to encounter in a specific class.  He covers what he thinks the ""main"" points are.  Third, the instructor presumes that you have a foundation in certain topics, so he does not go into great detail on the basics you need to solve the problems on this particular DVD.With that said, as a person who has not taken a math class in over 10 years, and am returning to school to take some math and science classes, this is as the title says a great overview.  Each chapter on the DVD builds upon the previous one, and the instructor provides many examples of how to work through the problems.  It is most definitely meant to be a supplement to class and the textbook, not a replacement for either.What makes Jason's material different and in some ways better than a lot of the free sources you can get on the internet (although some of those are good too) is that he goes through the material in the same order you will get it in class. He does not always touch on every concept (which is why you still have to go to class) but he hits the main points that you are most likely to see in a timed quiz or test environment. His teaching style is learn by example. Unlike most books and even some teachers, who delve into theory then give one or two easy examples and leave you to your own devices for 50 problems, he shows you how to actually do the work and explains what theory needs to be explained along the way. Which is great for those of us who are visual and auditory learners.I personally find Jason's style very easy to follow and think he has a knack for making things easier to understand. He shows you the things you need to know to be able to go to your textbook and work through the problems (which he constantly encourages people to do) and provides a great alternate voice if you do not understand your teacher. While it is not a substitute for going to class, it is great for those who want to prepare ahead of time, or to use as exam prep.",5,Very good overview.,1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,2227,"['First', 'DVD', 'guy', 'standing', 'front', 'white', 'board', 'doing', 'math', 'problems', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'most', 'exciting', 'thing', 'earth', 'depending', 'how', 'learn', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Second', 'instructor', 'not', 'cover', 'topic', 'one', 'likely', 'encounter', 'specific', 'class', 'what', 'main', 'points', 'are', 'Third', 'instructor', 'have', 'foundation', 'certain', 'topics', 'not', 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'basics', 'need', 'solve', 'problems', 'particular', 'DVD.With', 'said', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'taken', 'math', 'class', '10', 'years', 'am', 'returning', 'school', 'take', 'math', 'science', 'classes', 'title', 'great', 'overview', 'chapter', 'DVD', 'previous', 'one', 'instructor', 'many', 'examples', 'how', 'work', 'problems', 'most', 'definitely', 'meant', 'be', 'supplement', 'class', 'textbook', 'not', 'replacement', 'either.What', 'Jason', 'material', 'different', 'ways', 'better', 'lot', 'free', 'sources', 'can', 'get', 'internet', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'material', 'same', 'order', 'will', 'get', 'class', 'not', 'always', 'touch', 'concept', 'why', 'still', 'have', 'go', 'class', 'main', 'points', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'see', 'timed', 'quiz', 'test', 'environment', 'teaching', 'style', 'learn', 'example', 'most', 'books', 'even', 'teachers', 'who', 'delve', 'theory', 'then', 'give', 'one', 'two', 'easy', 'examples', 'leave', 'own', 'devices', '50', 'problems', 'how', 'actually', 'do', 'work', 'what', 'theory', 'be', 'explained', 'way', 'Which', 'great', 'who', 'are', 'visual', 'auditory', 'learners.I', 'personally', 'find', 'Jason', 'style', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'think', 'knack', 'making', 'things', 'easier', 'understand', 'things', 'need', 'know', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'textbook', 'work', 'problems', 'constantly', 'people', 'do', 'great', 'alternate', 'voice', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'teacher', 'not', 'substitute', 'going', 'class', 'great', 'who', 'want', 'prepare', 'ahead', 'time', 'use', 'exam', 'prep']",N/A
