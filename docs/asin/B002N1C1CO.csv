The acting by supporting cast was subpar (not sure that a most likely-gay character named Rich Munsch -- Dick Munch -- was the right move), but leads Panettiere and Rust did a great job (Rust's comedic timing and physicality were right on). The best thing about the film was the final message conveyed: that no one can live up to our own standards and fantasies; that it's easier to love an expectation rather than reality. But the most heartwarming thing about this film is that Rust's Denis Cooverman loves her regardless, which is showcased so poignantly sweet in the final scene.The soundtrack is awesome and I liked the open-ended ending which keeps a realistic tone to a film that otherwise isn't exactly realistic.

I actually went to high school with a girl named Beth Cooper, and she sort of resembles the Beth Cooper character in this film both in appearance and personality!  That's just creepy, haha.Anyway, I Love You, Beth Cooper features some of the most predictable and ""been there, done that"" teenage humor I've ever seen.  This movie brings absolutely NOTHING new to the table in the genre of silly, pointless teen comedies.  However, it's not a total loss.I love the scene with the guy going crazy and towel smacking the school bullies to shreds in a locker room, haha.  A classic moment.  This scene alone elevates the rating up an additional point from a 2 out of 5, to a 3!  He whips 'em up good and hysterically!Besides that, there's a LOT of predictable humor.  For instance, one evening a group of teenagers decide to go cow tipping.  Yes, you know what happens.  They can't actually tip the cows because something goes wrong.  In this case, one kid steps in poo poo and then has to deal with the cows chasing after him and his friends- this may be considered humor for the sake of the movie, but trust me, in real life it's NO laughing matter when a bunch of cows are chasing after you.  I can certainly relate to THAT freaky moment!Anyway, another good moment of the storyline is the very beginning when, during a classmates graduation speech, he actually reveals all kinds of personal information about himself along with admitting his love for a female classmate of his by the name of... yes you guessed it, Beth Cooper.  Talk about embarrassing!  I can relate to this though- I remember doing similar things in 12th grade and didn't care how embarrassing it was because it was my final year.Anyway, don't expect a groundbreaking comedy, but you'll probably find yourself laughing on a few occasions.",3,"dry humor, but has its moments",1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,1849,"['Wow', 'talk', 'really', 'big', 'coincidence', 'actually', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'named', 'Beth', 'Cooper', 'sort', 'resembles', 'Beth', 'Cooper', 'character', 'film', 'appearance', 'personality', 'just', 'creepy', 'haha.Anyway', 'Love', 'Beth', 'Cooper', 'most', 'predictable', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'teenage', 'humor', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'NOTHING', 'new', 'table', 'genre', 'silly', 'pointless', 'teen', 'comedies', 'However', 'not', 'total', 'loss.I', 'scene', 'guy', 'going', 'crazy', 'towel', 'smacking', 'school', 'bullies', 'shreds', 'locker', 'room', 'haha', 'classic', 'moment', 'scene', 'alone', 'rating', 'up', 'additional', 'point', '2', '5', '3', 'up', 'good', 'hysterically', 'LOT', 'predictable', 'humor', 'instance', 'one', 'evening', 'group', 'teenagers', 'decide', 'go', 'cow', 'tipping', 'Yes', 'know', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'tip', 'cows', 'something', 'wrong', 'case', 'one', 'kid', 'steps', 'poo', 'poo', 'then', 'deal', 'cows', 'chasing', 'friends-', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'humor', 'sake', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'NO', 'laughing', 'matter', 'when', 'bunch', 'cows', 'are', 'chasing', 'can', 'certainly', 'relate', 'freaky', 'moment', 'Anyway', 'good', 'moment', 'storyline', 'very', 'beginning', 'when', 'classmates', 'graduation', 'speech', 'actually', 'kinds', 'personal', 'information', 'admitting', 'love', 'female', 'classmate', 'name', 'yes', 'guessed', 'Beth', 'Cooper', 'Talk', 'embarrassing', 'can', 'relate', 'though-', 'remember', 'doing', 'similar', 'things', '12th', 'grade', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'embarrassing', 'was', 'was', 'final', 'year.Anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'groundbreaking', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'laughing', 'few', 'occasions']",N/A

So in the backgound I had to endure this stuff.I always wonder:  Didn't writers or directors ever go to high school?  'Cause if they had, they would know that all of these movies - well, at least most of them - are so fake and unlikely that those writers and directors would cringe themselves if they knew the truth.  Let's see; what's the template for these movies?. . . .Geek dude meets hot chick; hot chick warms up to geek dude; a contrived scenario ensues allowing hot chick to realize geek dude is actually a good guy; geek dude ends up with hot chick.  OK; so maybe the dude doesn't always end up with the hot chick, but he has a chance.  (And no.  This is not a spoiler because you've seen this film before a thousand times, even if you haven't seen it even once.)And why do people like films such as these?  Well, I don't like them, but some people must because they keep getting made.  But I have a theory:  guys want to at least dream that they can trade up to a babe; and women want to feel better about themselves - precariously through the female lead - feeling as if they actually have a heart, and actually are willing to look past weaknesses that guys have, and might be willing to go out with them.  In real life, they might even marry them!  Yeah.  Happens all the time.  Not.Phooey.

Chow,"[4, 6]","Hayden + Nails + ChalkboardI've said Hayden Panettiere could rake her nails across a chalkboard for 90 minutes and it would still make a great movie. Apparently this inspired director Chris Columbus.'I Love You Beth Cooper' isn't just a bad rip off of ""wild girl falls in love with shy guy"" which we've seen over and over and over and over and over and over again. ('Risky Business' 'Girl Next Door') IT IS NAILS ON A CHALKBOARD from beginning to end.The screenplay is almost as bad as a Stephanie Myer book. Almost. I laughed three or four times total. The jokes are plain unfunny and predictable. The bullies show up for a fight. What a shock, Hayden saves the day by crashing a car into the house.Even worse, the injuries. People being run over by cars or falling off of buildings is funny because it's unreal and ridiculous. People having real accidents and spurting blood out of their fingers, mouth, and nose, isn't funny. It's nauseating. Is this a teen comedy or is Chris Columbus remaking his 'Homes Alone' films with more blood?Hayden's nails on a chalkboard might be entertaining but it's star Paul Rust's nails that we have to put up with for 90 minutes. Is this his real voice or is he trying to outdo Jerry Lewis' ""Laaaaaddddaayyy""? Either way he far out ranks Sandra Bullock, Rosie Perez and Fran Dresser as more annoying than a car alarm. Seriously. It will be days before I can erase his screeching voice from my mind!!!Another sign of doom is that this is a raunchy teen comedy rated PG-13. DOOM!Whatever falling out Chris Columbus had with the studio whom kicked him off the 'Harry Potter' series he has really sunk to the lowest level of low.Worse yet Columbus has the nerve to embroil the celestially beautiful and talented Hayden Panettiere in this cesspool of a film.The two stars go to Hayden who deserved far better than this! All Hayden fans be warned! Just as with 'Heroes' fast forward to the Hayden scenes with your one free hand.

1278834,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002N1C1CO,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 5]","What, I ask you, would be accomplished by humiliating your high school classmates during a graduation speech? And I mean other than making everyone hate you. In ""I Love You, Beth Cooper,"" valedictorian Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) uses his final speech as an opportunity to say what he has been longing to say ever since his freshman days, none more important the five words that make up the film's title. Other than her, he mentions no one else by name; he only alludes to specific people by describing obvious character traits. You can be sure that everyone knew who he was referring to, and that brings me back to the question I posed at the start of this review. When you use your graduation as a platform to put other people down, you should not be surprised when they get very angry at you.""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" opens on a wrong premise. The entire film is wrong. On every level imaginable. It's not funny. It's not cute. It's not even remotely engaging or clever in its approach to the story. It's a brainless, mean-spirited film that treats comedy like a second-class citizen. It's appalling that it was directed by Chris Columbus, who once proved he could be entertaining with such fun fare as ""Home Alone,"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" ""Rent,"" and the first two ""Harry Potter"" films. For ""I Love You, Beth Cooper,"" the Directors Guild of America should have done him a favor and resurrected that old standby Alan Smithee, a pseudonym for directors who didn't want their real names attached their films.Having been embarrassed in front of the whole graduating class, Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere) and her dimwitted friends decide it would be funny to go to Denis' house, where he and his friend, Rich Munsch (Jack T. Carpenter), host a pathetic post-graduate party that absolutely no one wants to go to. Does Beth like Denis? Not really. But she does find him amusing. Her boyfriend, a testosterone-pumping, cocaine-sniffing military brute named Kevin (Shawn Roberts), does not find him amusing at all. In fact, he would like nothing more than to slowly and painfully kill Denis, preferably when it also involves the destruction of private property. Hoping to escape Kevin, Beth takes Denis and Rich on an all-night road trip in her mini hatchback. Maybe ""road trip"" isn't the right term--Beth has the driving skills of a chimpanzee.Along the way, Beth and Denis begin the process of getting to know one another. More accurately, Denis tries to survive Beth while she stands back and watches him continually make a fool of himself. I guess we're supposed to sympathize with her somewhere along the way, seeing as she gradually reveals her emotional side, calloused over after years of being used by other boys. Did Columbus and screenwriter Larry Doyle (who adapted his own novel) actually believe that this movie could make us care about her situation? When you willingly include a scene in which tampons are used to stop a nosebleed, you can't believably pause to make a meaningful statement. You definitely can't hint at the possibility of a sweet teenage romance.Most importantly, you can't begin a story with an act of stupidity and then expect the audience to blindly accept everything that happens afterwards. In all honesty, part of me sided with Denis' classmates--God knows I'd be mad as hell if I was outed in front of everyone. There's absolutely nothing to be gained by pointing out someone's eating disorder, exposing the emotional turmoil raging within the school bully, or encouraging your best friend to come out of the closet. I'm referring to Rich, who constantly quotes from movies and has the uncanny ability to name the actor who said it, the movie it was said in, and the year the movie was released. If there's one thing most people can't stand, it's when someone goes through life as an unwanted human encyclopedia.I can already see the comments this review will get. ""God Chris, it's a comedy. It was never meant to win awards. Not everything has to be an art house movie. Get a life."" True, I'm being hard on this film. True, I believe it's a shallow and juvenile story that will never win an award (except, maybe, for a Razzie). True, an art house movie in all likelihood would have been an infinitely better choice. But you know what? There is such a thing a good escapist comedy. I gave passing grades to both ""Balls of Fury"" and ""My Best Friend's Girl,"" two films that most critics dismissed as cinematic garbage. I felt they had ambition. ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" most definitely did not. It only wanted to be a mindless farce about idiotic people. Denis, who clearly doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut, is the most idiotic person of all. Then again, maybe that distinction belongs to Columbus, who seems to have forgotten what a movie needs in order to work. Let's hope he gets his memory back.",2,The One Girl I'd Act Stupidly for,1247184000,"07 10, 2009",2009,4837,"['What', 'ask', 'would', 'be', 'accomplished', 'humiliating', 'high', 'school',

Get it, Cooper / Cooverman, alphabetical seating? There are several behind jokes. Denis, the valedictorian, tells his whole class how much he loves Beth. He also goes on to offend everyone else in his class. Then has a graduation party. Beth shows up and the night of mayhem is off and running.I watched this movie with my 13 year old son. There were several cringe inducing moments, the condom conversation, the behind jokes, the language, the threesome joke with the Suzi-Q licking, and especially the geek moment of the party. My son thought that part was very sad funny. It was a wonderful moment to talk about how when people are nervous they say really stupid things, even if they don't mean them or really think them. It was a nice father son moment. I also rated this movie just a bit better than if I'd watched this alone. The 13 year old did laugh fairly frequently.The rating, this is a PG-13 film. The last few films I've seen with this rating seem to be pushing the envelope a lot (The Proposal (Single Disc Widescreen)- Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds nude scene). This is a fairly mature film. It probably would have been better full out R rating and just shown the parts it wanted to show. There's a lot of National Lampoon in this film. Yes there is a moment when Hayden is completely naked and there is a clear side view. The language is a bit rough, the f bomb never gets thrown, but there's a lot of other language. There's a lot of drinking in the film. But no drug use! There's a ton of violence, and stupid violence at that. Bullies beat up the geeks relentlessly. A huge number of shots between the legs.If I could characterize this film, it's the Big Bang Theory meets National Lampoon's Dorm Daze, Booty Call, Pucked, or Spring Break (a good television program meets a very bad movie). Teenage boys will love this movie. Male Hayden Panettiere fans will love this movie. It's a silly movie.",3,Hayden,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,2410,"['remarkably', 'stupid', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'many', 'painful', 'moments', 'big', 'negative', 'film', 'Paul', 'Rust', '30', 'Seriously', '18', 'year', 'old', '30', 'Guess', 'how', 'old', 'Paul', 'was', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', '28', 'bright', 'spot', 'oh', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'are', 'actually', 'number', 'funny', 'jokes', 'just', 'enough', 'gloss', 'groan', 'moments.Denis', 'Cooverman', 'Paul', 'Rust', 'was', 'love', 'Beth', 'Cooper', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'seventh', 'grade', 'when', 'sat', 'Get', 'Cooper', '/', 'Cooverman', 'alphabetical', 'seating', 'are', 'several', 'jokes', 'Denis', 'valedictorian', 'whole', 'class', 'how', 'much', 'Beth', 'also', 'offend', 'everyone', 'else', 'class', 'Then', 'graduation', 'party', 'Beth', 'up', 'night', 'mayhem', 'running.I', 'watched', 'movie', '13', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'were', 'several', 'cringe', 'inducing', 'moments', 'condom', 'conversation', 'behind', 'jokes', 'language', 'threesome', 'joke', 'Suzi-Q', 'licking', 'especially', 'geek', 'moment', 'party', 'My', 'son', 'thought', 'part', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'funny', 'was', 'wonderful', 'moment', 'talk', 'how', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'nervous', 'say', 'really', 'stupid', 'things', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'nice', 'father', 'son', 'moment', 'also', 'rated', 'movie', 'just', 'bit', 'better', ""'d"", 'watched', 'alone', '13', 'year', 'old', 'did', 'laugh', 'fairly', 'frequently.The', 'rating', 'PG-13', 'film', 'last', 'few', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'rating', 'seem', 'be', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'lot', 'Proposal', 'Single', 'Disc', 'Widescreen', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'nude', 'scene', 'fairly', 'mature', 'film', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'full', 'out', 'R', 'rating', 'just', 'shown', 'parts', 'wanted', 'show', 'lot', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'film', 'Yes', 'moment', 'when', 'Hayden', 'completely', 'naked', 'clear', 'side', 'view', 'language', 'bit', 'rough', 'f', 'bomb', 'never', 'thrown', 'lot', 'other', 'language', 'lot', 'drinking', 'film', 'drug', 'use', 'ton', 'violence', 'stupid', 'violence', 'Bullies', 'beat', 'up', 'geeks', 'relentlessly', 'huge', 'number', 'shots', 'legs.If', 'could', 'characterize', 'film', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Dorm', 'Daze', 'Booty', 'Call', 'Pucked', 'Spring', 'Break', 'good', 'television', 'program', 'very', 'bad', 'movie', 'Teenage', 'boys', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'Male', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'silly', 'movie']",N/A

1278838,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002N1C1CO,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 9]","Just another teenage graduation night film?  Or something much better?""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" was a film that debuted back in the Summer of 2009 and is based on a 2007 novel by writer Larry Doyle (""The Simpsons"", ""Beavis and Butthead"").  With a screenplay adaptation from the novel by Doyle, the film would be directed by Chris Columbus (""Mrs. Doubtfire"", the first two ""Home Alone"" and ""Harry Potter"" films), music composed by Christophe Beck (""The Pink Panther 2"", ""We Are Marshall"", ""Elektra"") and cinematography by Phil Abraham (""Mad Men"", ""The Sopranos"").Larry Doyle has mentioned that his inspiration for the story was films like ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" and his take on graduation night and the adventures of five teenagers.The film revolves around Denis Cooverman (played by Paul Rust, ""Semi-Pro"", ""Inglourious Basterds""), a valedictorian at his high school who is planning to go to college at Stanford University.  A smart student, he has his life going for him.  But if there was one thing that he regrets, it's the fact that he has always had a crush on Beth Cooper.He hangs out with his best friend Rich Munsch (played by Jack Carpenter, ""The Return of Jezebel James"", ""The Journal"") who gives him a pep talk that because it's graduation day, if he has things to get off his chest, let it out with no regrets.  Tell Beth Cooper how he feels and  for Denis, this stays in his head but instead of telling her face-to-face, he figured why not tell her on graduation day during his valedictorian speech.As he gives his speech and talks about living life with no regrets, in front of everyone at the graduation, he tells the popular cheerleader Beth Cooper (played by Hayden Panettiere, ""Heroes"", ""Shanghai Kiss"", ""Malcolm in the Middle"") that he loves her and how he has always loved her.  But somehow along the way, his speech starts to go downhill as he takes a swipe on fellow students such as his his best friend, Rich (who he tries to give a hint that its time to come out of the closet), a swipe at the school bully that has tormented him throughout their school years,  a hint to the girls who has an eating disorder, a swipe that men shouldn't be dating high school students (a dig at Beth Cooper's boyfriend Kevin, who is played by Shawn Roberts) and a dig on a popular but yet shallow student.  Of course, no names are being said but high school students start to judge who may be the person Denis is referring to and thus changes the jovial graduation to a graduation full of discomfort and confusion.  Needless to say, students who think Denis was talking about them, give him the stare of death after the graduation day.Denis doesn't realize the severity of what he has done but for Beth Cooper, she was very much appreciative of what he had to say, although her military boyfriend Kevin is not and really wants to beat Denis up.Fortunately, this causes problems between Beth and Kevin and sure enough, Denis is able to get her to possibly come to party he is hosting at his house.Since Denis and Rich are not exactly popular students and very much are nerds, his parents (played by Alan Ruck and Cynthia Stevenson) leave the house for some R&R; and hope their son has a great party. Of course, during a man-to-man talk with Denis and his father, his father tells him and Rich that if needed, there are condoms in the drawer of his bedroom.  Of course, Denis is happy his dad is giving his blessing to get lucky tonight while Rich wonders if the condoms are meant to be used on each other (furthering Denis's feelings that his friend is gay).So, while the two wonder if anyone is going to come to their party, Beth Cooper and her two popular cheerleading friends Cammy Alcott (played by Lauren London, ""90210') and the bubbly yet not-so-smart Treece (played by Lauren Storm, ""Flight 29 Down"", ""The Game Plan"") come to the party.  With no one else coming, both Denis and Rich try to entertain the ladies but meanwhile, Beth tries to make her ex-boyfriend Kevin jealous by telling him that she's spending her time with Denis.Next thing you know, Beth's ex-boyfriend Kevin and two of his military friends go to Denis's home and so livid that his girlfriend is spending time at Denis's house, they start trashing the place, while Kevin's mission  is to literally beat up on him.Denis tries to fight and defend himself and of course, it leads to nothing and thus both he and Rich end up escaping the house through the window and falling to the ground.  After sustaining some injuries, the two manage to join Beth Cooper and friends on an adventurous graduation night which leads them to bare Beth's bad driving,  buying beer at a convenience store, going to a farm  to tip cows, going to a graduation night party where a lot of the high school kids are at and avoiding destruction on the roadway while trying to have a good graduation night and for the most part, to be out of the way of Kevin and his friends.But through the night, Denis who feels that he knows everything about Beth Cooper starts to see a side of her that he has never seen before.  A good side but also a bad side.Will Denis survive the night and will Beth Cooper get to know the real him?VIDEO & AUDIO:""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (AVC@33MBPS).  For the most part, picture quality is pretty good as the film is featured in the sunlight.  But the film pretty much takes place during the night.  During the day, colors are vibrant, during the evening the blacks are nice and deep and I saw no visual artifacts or banding.For the most part, the film looks very good.  But to tell you the truth, I didn't notice too many details that stood out.  The truth is that there are not exactly a lot of memorable scenes as most of the action takes place inside Denis's home or inside Beth's car.  Seeing the scabs or blood all over Denis's face is something I wasn't really trying to look for detail but if there was one scene that stood out, it was a breathtaking scene overlooking the lake and mountains near the end of the film.  Picture quality is good for the film on HD.As for the audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also in Spanish, Portuguese and French 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily a dialogue and music driven film and are front and center channel driven.  There are some scenes that utilize the surrounds such as crowds heard or the various crashing of cars or during the more action-based scenes.  Probably one scene where you get the most action is when Beth Cooper literally crashes to a home where party is being held. But for the most part, the film is literally more about the dialogue and the music and the lossless audio definitely showcases the modern music of this film.Subtitles are featured in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese and Cantonese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" comes with the following special features:* Alternate Ending - (6:59) An alternate ending which features Kevin and his friends making one more encounter with Denis.  An ironic ending but personally, I'm glad that they didn't use this ending.* Deleted Scenes - (7:36) Featuring four deleted scenes: The Graduate, College Worthy Handyman, Beth Digs for Buried Treasure, Beth Remembers a Cooverman Moment.* I Love You, Larry Doyle - (5:52) Novel/screenwriter Larry Doyle talks about the book and the film adaptation and how films like ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" inspired him.* We Are All Different, But That's a Good Thing - (8:53) A featurette focusing on the cast talking about the characters they play and the great dynamics that the characters have.  The talent talk about how they enjoyed working with Hayden Panettiere and director Chris Columbus.* Peanut Butter Toast - (2:48) Paul Rust singing an improvised song about ""peanut butter toast"".* Fox Movie Channel Presents In Character with Paul Rust - (3:01) Fox Movie Channel presents Paul Rust talking about the movie and his character.* Fox Movie Channel Presents In Character with Hayden Panettiere - (3:01) Fox Movie Channel presents Hayden Panettiere talking about the movie and her character.* Trailers - Trailers for ""My Life In Ruins"", ""Adam"", ""Fame"" and ""The Marine 2'.JUDGMENT CALL:""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" was like a mashup of my favorite teen/young adult films that I have enjoyed in the past and present.  A little bit of ""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Say Anything"", ""American Pie"", ""Superbad"", ""Go"", ""Nick and Norah's Playlist"" to name a few.  With each of those films, there is a sort of redemption with the characters or some type of happy ending.  I suppose you can say that with this film, ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"", it's more like a one night stand that really doesn't go anywhere after that.  I couldn't help but feel that perhaps there were major differences between the novel and the film version.As for the main characters, it's not that they are unlikeable but Denis and Rich are your stereotypical nerds and with this storyline, you sort of think that this film would predictable in that the nerd gets the hot girl at the end or meets some success, whether redemption against the bully or possibly even getting a new girlfriend.If anything, for most teen films or similar style of films, the main nerd characters always gets the better end of the deal at the end of the film but in this case, I felt that redemption was given to the Denis's best friend Rich (who is just a supporting character) and he gets to have all the fun at the end and somehow, that just didn't seem right to me.  Somehow the main character, Denis Cooverman gets lots in the shuffle and by watching this film, you can't help but feel sorry for him.  He literally becomes the human punching bag and you wish for that ""3:00 High"" moment of redemption of where he would defend himself.  It's important to note that there is an alternate ending included on the Blu-ray via the special features where Denis does get that redemption but unfortunately, the final cut chose not to go that direction.""I Love You, Beth Cooper""  is not a bad film nor is it a spectacular teen film.  But  I'll admit, I did enjoy it.  I enjoyed the nightly adventures by the five characters (granted, it helps if you had a wild experience during your graduation night) and the crazy adventures they endured throughout the day and night.  There are some comedic moments courtesy of the character of Rich and Treece.And fortunately there are some shining moments with Paul Rust as the main character of Denis.  If anything, he is a good hearted guy.  Nerdy..but a good-hearted guy who is not all that good with talking to girls. Rust captures that feel of the character and that awkward nerdiness.  Hayden Panettiere is very good at playing the popular cheerleader who likes to have fun and party but also likes to have some danger in her life (sounds similar to her ""Heroes"" counterpart but really, it's not).  And it was great to see Alan Ruck as Denis's father in the film, 23-years later after taking part in his own successful, teen adventure film as the best friend in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".But it's that one scene that was changed in the film from the novel (the convenience store scene) between Denis and Beth Cooper that was so important but in order to not get the R rating and keep it at PG-13,  I felt would have really made sense to the audience of why Rust's character starts to see things differently with Beth Cooper.  In my opinion, that was one scene critical to the novel that brings a turning point to the storyline.  So, it's unfortunate that version of that one scene was not used.Overall, ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" is an entertaining teenage graduation night film but nowhere near being classic.At the end of the day, you can see how Chris Columbus and even Larry Doyle tried to bring that John Hughes style to the film.  But Hughes was a master in character development and knew how to take those characters to the craziest and more touching moments of the film.  We see the adventure, we just don't feel captivated by the characters.  Again, the film has its share of fun moments but it's the final payoff that you expect from these type of films is what is lacking from ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"".  In the end, ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" is a fun popcorn flick but nothing more than that.",2,"Blu-ray: For a Chris Columbus directed film, I expected more.

1278843,APEOO1ATR5VHB,B002N1C1CO,"Hype Currie ""scholar of pop culture""","[2, 3]","""I Love You Beth Cooper"" is a comedy film starring ""Heroes"" ingenue Hayden Panettiere in the title role. The film's pitch may have sounded great on paper-- Nerdy high school senior Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) declares his years-long crush on popular cheerleader Beth on their graduation day, invites her to a party that no one is really coming to, only to have her show up, and all sorts of wacky misadventures ensue.Indeed, it apparently sounded good on paper since the screenplay was adapted by the novel's author Larry Doyle. That being the case, the excuse of having an unsympathetic interpreter doesn't apply here. The characters are, of course, stereotypes, but for the most part they're not particularly entertaining stereotypes: Denis, despite his temporary boldness in his valedictorian speech, comes across as relentlessly wimpy for the entire rest of the film; the same goes for his best friend Rich (Jack Carpenter), a film-quoting geek who can't help but give the IMDB-rundown on every line he clips from a film character; it's not until the end when this character finally gets some backbone..As the title character, Panettiere's Beth Cooper is the typical vapid and so-popular-i'm-really-depressed Dream Girl that populates these kinds of movies. An aside about a deceased sibling is vaguely touching but it comes far too late to justify why Denis would pine so long for someone who quite literally didn't know he existed until that day. Ms. Panettiere is as cute as a button, but she really isn't given much to do here. Beth's best-pals are even less-developed. Beth's rageaholic (and apparently drug addict!) boyfriend Kevin (Shawn Roberts) slightly resembles a young Bill Paxton. Alan Ruck, an alumnus of the conceptually similar ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" plays Denis' wants-to-be-cool dad (champagne is made available for Denis' party), though it's surprising that no lines from ""Bueller"" were clipped here for comic effect.before the end of the film, entire houses are casually destroyed, reckless drivers menace the road, and nary a police officer is called, apparently.Chris Columbus has delivered a number of entertaining films over the years, including the first two Harry Potter films, and the tangentially similar ""Adventures in Babysitting"".

It's hard to tell since he wears each rank, one on each arm (ridiculous movie mistake).  Along with Denis's friend Rich (Jack Carpenter), who's obsessed with ensuring everyone is aware of his questionable heterosexuality, the two throw the lamest party imaginable.  They invite Beth and her two friends, Treece (Lauren Storm) and Cammy (Lauren London - who is a less sexy version of Bianca Lawson), where a crazy night of drinking, being chased by Kevin, and more social awkwardness.If you want to watch the completely unbelievable pairing of a nerd and a hot chick, I can think of three superior films.  First there isThe Girl Next Door, a film from which this should be charged with cinematic plagiarism (there's even the ""guy naked outside of girl's sporty car""-scene).  Second, there isShe's Out of My League, equally unrealistic but infinitely funnier.  And, of course, there is the pinnacle of this genre,Revenge of the Nerds- because nobody can be more atrociously nerdy than Robert Carradine.The ride is somewhat entertaining, mostly because of Beth Cooper's driving, but the predictable eventually happens: Denis learns that Beth is not as great as he thought, while Beth opens up and shows the nerd the most adventurous night of his life.

Yeah, I went to go see it despite a nearly universal crushing blow that was delivered by the film critic industry.But it really is that bad. It should come as no surprise, based on the movie trailer, that a high school brainiac confesses his true love to the prettiest cheerleader in high school during his valedictorian speech. During his initial speech, he makes an attempt of a joke that is intended to fall flat.The rest of the movie is just that, though. When it DOES try to make a joke, it falls flat. Also, the rest of the movie plays out like a real high school geek's dream of how things might turn out. The girl comes over with her friends (initially as a joke) and they all wind up getting caught up in crazy situations that is supposed to make the geek realize that there should be fun in your life when you're young and to make the pretty young thing realize that there is more to love.  It's a movie that sincerely tries to show that it has a heart, but it truly doesn't and even our main character doesn't come across as wholly sympathetic either.Sadly, it doesn't play out realistically or comedically. It plays out more like a series of sketches with a ""romantic teen comedy"" somehow loosely stringing it together like wet pasta noodles restraining a felon.It's horrible, it's unfunny, and I don't buy how the girls manage to remain hanging around with our high school geek and his friend.

The premise is actually pretty good, high school geek admits in his valadictorian speech, his crush on the pretty and popular cheerleader  Beth Cooper. The speech is actually one of the best parts of the movie. The humor however appears lost on anyone over a certain age (we'll say twenty to twenty five is the cutoff.)Underneath the high schoolish humor and the unbeilvably of the plot twists, there is an intresting message about living for the day and seizing the moment that archs through the entire movie, along with seeing beyond looks and perception in people.Sometimes, I like the cliffhanger ending were the viewer is allowed to make their own conclusion about what happens to the characters, but the lack of a definitive hook up by Beth and Denis takes away from the movie I feel, because it leaves one wondering ""Was this just a one night thing""  or do they hook up later on. Another downside, I don't think the characters were as fleshed out as they could've been, but i'm not sure if that's a problem in the writing or acting. Hayden Panettiere seemed like she was playing the tweener cheerleader (were we supposed to dislike her at first and than grow to feel empathy for her later or were we supposed to feel sympathy for her all along ?Still I liked this movie, despite the crazy scenerios and the basic characters that lacked depth because on some level, I could relate to it because most of us have chased the popular girl/guy.

The Blu clarity was outstanding throughout; night sequences, colors, saturation, action, landscapes - all of it. The DTS was great; the music was mixed perfect as to still hear the simultaneous dialogues perfectly and the outer channels get used quite a bit. The supplements are extensive and include:(HI-DEF)* 7 minute alternate ending. It branches off from the dock scene near the end of the theatrical cut and takes a way different slant with the three muscle heads imposing on their lake location with weird results. You do not see any of the parent-in-the-yard ending.* 7:36 minutes of deleted scenes with a play all option. Forgettable, glad they were cut.* 5:54 minutes of  Love U Larry Doyle. The inspiration behind the story and interviews with the author.* 8:54 minute We're All Different plug. Essentially the casting reasons, how everyone liked their parts, blah, blah, blah.* 2:48 minute Peanut Butter Toast. A home video clip of Rust singing about making toast in his kitchen - painful.(LO-DEF)* 3:02 minute Fox interview with Paul Rust. An ad plug for the film with an interview.* 3:02 minute Fox interview with Hayden. Same thing.The only thing I got out of this was all the movie trivia his sidekick kept spewing, liked it. Otherwise this whole corny story of the nerd getting the hot chick through a million unlikely events, road trips and bad acting didn't work for me. I am sure this will appeal to the teen fans of Hayden and some of the other eye candy followers (Shawn Roberts, etc.) But, I have to rate this higher overall because the Blu provides plenty of reference points for a film of this genre; both sound and pic clarity (especially those lake/mountain panorama scenes).

But not in the world of movies. I Love You, Beth Cooper is one of those films that horrendously overuses the ideas (and not even the better ones) of previous entries in the teen comedy genre, resulting in an exercise in repetition and failed mimicry. Awkwardly personal advice from a father figure, aggressive small animals, nude scenes without any real nudity, and the all-too-familiar plotline of the bashful introvert chasing after the most popular girl in school are just a few of the rehashed concepts found throughout the picture. There are really only two reasons the film gets a score of two - and both belong to Hayden Panattierre.During the graduation ceremony at Buffalo Glenn High School, bumbling, socially-challenged valedictorian Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) professes his love for popular head cheerleader Beth Cooper (Hayden Panattiere), as well as insulting his fellow classmates and embarrassing his best friend Rich (Jack Carpenter). While the ill-conceived words toward his peers subsequently cause trouble, his honest confession appears to strike a chord with the idolized teen beauty. Much to Denis' surprise, Beth shows up at his house and a wild night of raucous adventure ensues - one filled with incessant partying, reckless driving, and Beth's maniacally jealous military boyfriend.It's mildly amusing when the film starts with a rousing rendition of a song entitled ""Forget Me"" at a high school graduation. Following is a food-for-thought speech comprised of awkward prattling that struggles painfully for even the faintest hope of a smirk. But it doesn't get as much as a smile. As each second ticks away, the jokes get more stale, the slapstick more pathetic, and the plot more unbelievable. It's not that the story is hard to imagine - but it is difficult to understand why the cast and crew of I Love You, Beth Cooper ever thought this unimaginably pointless, hopelessly generic mess could pass as entertainment.It's very tame, excruciatingly PG-13 and terribly immature - which means teens won't see it and neither will adults. Denis discusses with his father that the teenage coming-of-age subject is not a new idea; if only director Chris Columbus had taken that advice and stayed away from Larry Doyle's vastly unoriginal novel. The presentation is bland, the dialogue is weak and not a single memorable or creative concept is introduced during the entire film. It's as amateurish as the socially inept geeks lumpishly trying to court prom queens. Quite obviously an excuse to put Hayden Panettiere in a movie, the sheer lack of humor is the biggest disappointment, while the constant references to other films by Rich is an embarrassment to decent movies everywhere. Even the most pitiful have a worthwhile minute, but aside from being the first film in which Hayden bares a partial breast, I Love You Beth Cooper has not a single satisfying scene. When the film culminates in an all-guy wet towel fight, Beth Cooper herself sums it up best: ""Who said it's supposed to be fun?""- The Massie Twins",1,"I Love You, Beth Cooper: Movie Review from The Massie Twins",1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,3114,"['Recycle', 'generally', 'good', 'word', 'one', 'positive', 'favorable', 'connotations', 'not', 'world', 'movies', 'Love', 'Beth', 'Cooper', 'one', 'films', 'horrendously', 'ideas', 'not', 'even', 'better', 'ones', 'previous', 'entries', 'teen', 'comedy', 'genre', 'resulting', 'exercise', 'repetition', 'failed', 'mimicry', 'Awkwardly', 'personal', 'advice', 'father', 'figure', 'aggressive', 'small', 'animals', 'nude', 'scenes', 'real', 'nudity', 'all-too-familiar', 'plotline', 'bashful', 'introvert', 'chasing', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'rehashed', 'concepts', 'found', 'picture', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'two', 'reasons', 'film', 'score', 'two', 'belong', 'Hayden', 'Panattierre.During', 'graduation', 'ceremony', 'Buffalo', 'Glenn', 'High', 'School', 'bumbling', 'socially-challenged', 'valedictorian', 'Denis', 'Cooverman', 'Paul', 'Rust', 'love', 'popular', 'head', 'cheerleader', 'Beth', 'Cooper', 'Hayden', 'Panattiere', 'as', 'well', 'insulting', 'fellow', 'classmates', 'embarrassing', 'best', 'friend', 'Rich', 'Jack', 'Carpenter', 'ill-conceived', 'words', 'peers', 'subsequently', 'cause', 'trouble', 'honest', 'confession', 'strike', 'chord', 'idolized', 'teen', 'beauty', 'Much', 'Denis', 'surprise', 'Beth', 'up', 'house', 'wild', 'night', 'raucous', 'adventure', 'one', 'filled', 'incessant', 'partying', 'reckless', 'driving', 'Beth', 'maniacally', 'jealous', 'military', 'boyfriend.It', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'when', 'film', 'rousing', 'rendition', 'song', 'entitled', 'Forget', 'Me', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'Following', 'food-for-thought', 'speech', 'comprised', 'awkward', 'prattling', 'painfully', 'even', 'faintest', 'hope', 'smirk', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'smile', 'second', 'ticks', 'away', 'jokes', 'get', 'more', 'stale', 'slapstick', 'more', 'pathetic', 'plot', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'not', 'story', 'hard', 'imagine', 'difficult', 'understand', 'why', 'cast', 'crew', 'Love', 'Beth', 'Cooper', 'ever', 'thought', 'unimaginably', 'pointless', 'hopelessly', 'generic', 'mess', 'could', 'pass', 'entertainment.It', 'very', 'tame', 'excruciatingly', 'PG-13', 'terribly', 'immature', 'teens', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'will', 'adults', 'Denis', 'father', 'teenage', 'coming-of-age', 'subject', 'not', 'new', 'idea', 'only', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'had', 'taken', 'advice', 'stayed', 'away', 'Larry', 'Doyle', 'vastly', 'unoriginal', 'novel', 'presentation', 'bland', 'dialogue', 'weak', 'not', 'single', 'memorable', 'creative', 'concept', 'introduced', 'entire', 'film', 'as', 'amateurish', 'socially', 'inept', 'geeks', 'lumpishly', 'trying', 'court', 'prom', 'queens', 'Quite', 'obviously', 'excuse', 'put', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'movie', 'sheer', 'lack', 'humor', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'constant', 'references', 'other', 'films', 'Rich', 'embarrassment', 'decent', 'movies', 'everywhere', 'Even', 'most', 'pitiful', 'have', 'worthwhile', 'minute', 'aside', 'being', 'first', 'film', 'Hayden', 'partial', 'breast', 'Love', 'Beth', 'Cooper', 'not', 'single', 'satisfying', 'scene', 'When', 'film', 'culminates', 'all-guy', 'wet', 'towel', 'fight', 'Beth', 'Cooper', 'sums', 'up', 'best', 'Who', 'said', 'supposed', 'be', 'fun', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A
