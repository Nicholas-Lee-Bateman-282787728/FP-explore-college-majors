806136,A2M597GCCE1N2S,B0001I2CFC,"the one and only ""david""","[15, 15]","After watching the first season on DVD I was instantly hit with the desire to buy the second season when it came out. So after I bought it and brought it home I watched every single episode from start to finish. The next day I was tired, yet still a big fan......The story continues with the small band of survivors, George Challenger, Margarite Crew, Ned Malone, and John Roxton. Arthur Summerlie is not here because in the last season he fell off the bridge during the battle with one of the tribes. Anyway the stories are diverse and interesting, which keeps this season interesting all the way through.The best episodes would have to be The Pirates Curse, which has everyone searching for a treasure chest, including some very nasty pirates. Another great show would be The Games, where are old friend, Tribune returns, who is like the fox in a fox hunt, being hunted by his former soldiers.He forces our heroes into helping and in the end both he and Roxton are chained together in a Roman galdiator type tournament. My personal favorite episode when it comes to action and comedy.Other great episodes would be:The outlaw: where Margarite is accused of thievery, and thrown in jail. She was great in that episode.The mark of the beast: Where everyone but Veronica turns into an animal after touching a stone with a weird mark on it. Challenger turns into a goat, Margarite a snake, Ned a bird, and Roxton a panther. He was creepy, but in a good way in this one.And the Voodoo Queen: Where Roxton becomes obessesed with a woman who claims that an ape man army destroyed her village. Turns out her story is anything but close to what she says.The other episodes aren't bad either, and some of you might find them even better than what I though. Thats up to you.The special effects are still as good, for a tv series, as the last season had. I still have to hold back a laugh when I see the T-Rex run after the explorers, and the ape men are great. I would definately reccommend this season to anyone who is a fan of this tv series.As for the acting, Roxton still proves he is the man that you should rely on in a fight, he leads several great roles in some of the episodes. But the others are great too, especially my favorite, Veronica! Anyway, cough cough, I really cant wait for the third season to come out, as for this, buy it today!",5,This show just keeps getting better,1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,2341,"['watching', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'was', 'instantly', 'hit', 'desire', 'buy', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'So', 'bought', 'brought', 'home', 'watched', 'single', 'episode', 'start', 'finish', 'next', 'day', 'was', 'tired', 'yet', 'still', 'big', 'fan', 'story', 'small', 'band', 'survivors', 'George', 'Challenger', 'Margarite', 'Crew', 'Ned', 'Malone', 'John', 'Roxton', 'Arthur', 'Summerlie', 'not', 'here', 'last', 'season', 'fell', 'off', 'bridge', 'battle', 'one', 'tribes', 'Anyway', 'stories', 'are', 'diverse', 'interesting', 'season', 'interesting', 'way', 'through.The', 'best', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Pirates', 'Curse', 'everyone', 'searching', 'treasure', 'chest', 'including', 'very', 'nasty', 'pirates', 'great', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'Games', 'where', 'are', 'old', 'friend', 'Tribune', 'returns', 'who', 'fox', 'fox', 'hunt', 'being', 'hunted', 'former', 'soldiers.He', 'forces', 'heroes', 'helping', 'end', 'Roxton', 'are', 'chained', 'together', 'Roman', 'galdiator', 'type', 'tournament', 'personal', 'favorite', 'episode', 'when', 'action', 'comedy.Other', 'great', 'episodes', 'would', 'be', 'outlaw', 'where', 'Margarite', 'accused', 'thievery', 'thrown', 'jail', 'was', 'great', 'episode.The', 'mark', 'beast', 'Where', 'everyone', 'Veronica', 'animal', 'touching', 'stone', 'weird', 'mark', 'Challenger', 'goat', 'Margarite', 'snake', 'Ned', 'bird', 'Roxton', 'panther', 'was', 'creepy', 'good', 'way', 'Voodoo', 'Queen', 'Where', 'Roxton', 'obessesed', 'woman', 'who', 'ape', 'man', 'army', 'destroyed', 'village', 'out', 'story', 'anything', 'close', 'what', 'says.The', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'might', 'find', 'even', 'better', 'what', 'though', 'Thats', 'up', 'you.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'tv', 'series', 'last', 'season', 'had', 'still', 'have', 'hold', 'back', 'laugh', 'when', 'see', 'T-Rex', 'run', 'explorers', 'ape', 'men', 'are', 'great', 'would', 'definately', 'reccommend', 'season', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'tv', 'series.As', 'acting', 'Roxton', 'still', 'man', 'should', 'rely', 'fight', 'several', 'great', 'roles', 'episodes', 'others', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'especially', 'favorite', 'Veronica', 'Anyway', 'cough', 'cough', 'really', 'cant', 'wait', 'third', 'season', 'come', 'out', 'buy', 'today']",Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World - Season Two
