The 4th season was terrible and I'm surprised it was renewed for a 5th. Doris seems to have gotten used to the show's format. It changed so many times in it's run. I would recommend buying seasons 2,1,5,3,4 in that order. I never watched this show during it's original run, since I was only a baby. I'm not a big fan of Doris' but this is a good family show, even if it's a little boring sometimes. It's definitly not as good as ""Mary Tyler Moore show"", but maybe as good as ""That girl"". They should have kept Rosie Marie in the cast, she left after season 3 and the supporting players are nothing special in this show. It's definitely all about Doris Day.

And I'm so delighted it is available on DVD, since it never did appear on the nostalgia channels on cable. The picture quality is clear, colorful and bright, much like the lady herself. Doris had been forced to do this series in order to pay off debts incurred by her late husband and his crooked lawyer, but you've never believe it, watching Doris on screen, as funny and endearing as ever. Her show is light and fun, easily suitable for young viewers as well. My favorite episodes are the fashion show ones, because that's a trip down memory lane with all those colorful 1970s fashions. This is the last season she did before calling it quits in Hollywood (aside from a couple of specials) and focusing her attention on animal causes. I'll have to admit that Season 5 is not my favorite season; my faves are Seasons 1,2, and 3.

1096987,A1Q87II9MJL7JF,B000UVV2CE,Paul Brogan,"[22, 27]","The fifth and final season of the hugely popular ""The Doris Day Show"" (1968 - 73) is about to be released on DVD.  Fans of Miss Day and of the genre are eagerly anticipating this release because, judging from the past four seasons, the extras alone make it worth the very reasonable price.  However, the big bonus contained in this season is the active participation of Doris Day herself.  The legendary star provides commentary for a couple of her favorite episodes and that should make this release even more popular than the previous seasons have proven to be.The fifth season found Miss Day continuing her go-getting role at Today's World, working for Cy Bennett (John Dehner) and aided and abetted by Jackie Parker (Jackie Joseph).Peter Lawford is still around as Day's love interest, during the early part of the season and even gets to direct an episode(""Debt of Honor"") but mid-way through the season, Patrick O'Neal, Day's co-star in the 1968 comedy, ""Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?"", begins appearing as a new love interest on the sitcom.  Day and O'Neal have sizzling on-screen chemistry and their romance is very believable and their scenes together very natural.The series has its usual quality production values, almost appearing to be a weekly movie.  The photography by Richard Rawlings is exceptional and Miss Day looks great, wearing some memorable 70's outfits that complement her knockout figure.  In fact during the annual Fashion Show episode, Miss Day models a bikini and shows that her figure could rival that of any so-called glamour girl or pin-up.  An interesting note: All of the background music played during the fashion show is either from a Day film or a Day recording.The series was known for having great guest stars and this season is no exception. Among those who appear are Billy de Wolfe continuing his amusing portrayal of Mr. Jarvis who now owns the building Day resides in, Julie Adams, Ed Begley, Jr., Roger C. Carmel, Dick Van Patten, Edward Andrews,Andy Griffith, Henry Jones,Lee Meriwether, Bernie Kopell,Sid Melton and Miss Day's beloved dog ""Biggest"".In the episode entitled, ""The CO-OP"", all the residents of the building Miss Day resides in band together after de Wolfe becomes the building owner.  Among those residents are a gay couple who live above Miss Day, a nod to just how ahead of the time this show could be at times.The writing is not always consistent but the performers give it their all and then some. Miss Day is always natural, real and a delight to watch. You believe in her and are always rooting for her.While ""The Doris Day Show"" may not have been an uproarious, side-splitting comedy with cutting edge writing, it was consistently warm, charming, amusing and enjoyable, a great throwback to an era when raunch or smut were not needed to satisfy audiences.The only regret you'll have after watching the fifth season is the reality that there are no more seasons forthcoming. It's been a lovely stroll down memory lane and a reminder of why Doris Day continues, more than 65 years after her professional debut, to delight audiences.",5,"DAY'S ""Fifth"" GOES DOWN EASY!!",1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,3110,"['fifth', 'final', 'season', 'hugely', 'popular', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Show', '1968', '73', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Fans', 'Miss', 'Day', 'genre', 'are', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'release', 'judging', 'past', 'four', 'seasons', 'extras', 'alone', 'make', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', 'However', 'big', 'bonus', 'contained', 'season', 'active', 'participation', 'Doris', 'Day', 'legendary', 'star', 'commentary', 'couple', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'should', 'make', 'release', 'even', 'more', 'popular', 'previous', 'seasons', 'have', 'proven', 'be.The', 'fifth', 'season', 'found', 'Miss', 'Day', 'continuing', 'go-getting', 'role', 'Today', 'World', 'working', 'Cy', 'Bennett', 'John', 'Dehner', 'aided', 'abetted', 'Jackie', 'Parker', 'Jackie', 'Joseph', '.Peter', 'Lawford', 'still', 'around', 'Day', 'love', 'interest', 'early', 'part', 'season', 'even', 'direct', 'episode', 'Debt', 'Honor', 'mid-way', 'season', 'Patrick', ""O'Neal"", 'Day', 'co-star', '1968', 'comedy', 'Where', 'Were', 'When', 'Lights', 'Went', 'Out', 'appearing', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'sitcom', 'Day', ""O'Neal"", 'have', 'sizzling', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'romance', 'very', 'believable', 'scenes', 'together', 'very', 'natural.The', 'series', 'usual', 'quality', 'production', 'values', 'almost', 'appearing', 'be', 'weekly', 'movie', 'photography', 'Richard', 'Rawlings', 'exceptional', 'Miss', 'Day', 'great', 'wearing', 'memorable', '70', 'outfits', 'complement', 'knockout', 'figure', 'fact', 'annual', 'Fashion', 'Show', 'episode', 'Miss', 'Day', 'models', 'bikini', 'figure', 'could', 'rival', 'so-called', 'glamour', 'girl', 'pin-up', 'interesting', 'note', 'background', 'music', 'played', 'fashion', 'show', 'either', 'Day', 'film', 'Day', 'recording.The', 'series', 'was', 'known', 'having', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'season', 'exception', 'who', 'appear', 'are', 'Billy', 'Wolfe', 'continuing', 'amusing', 'portrayal', 'Mr.', 'Jarvis', 'who', 'now', 'building', 'Day', 'Julie', 'Adams', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'Roger', 'C.', 'Carmel', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Patten', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Henry', 'Jones', 'Lee', 'Meriwether', 'Bernie', 'Kopell', 'Sid', 'Melton', 'Miss', 'Day', 'beloved', 'dog', 'Biggest', 'episode', 'entitled', 'CO-OP', 'residents', 'building', 'Miss', 'Day', 'band', 'together', 'de', 'Wolfe', 'building', 'owner', 'residents', 'are', 'gay', 'couple', 'who', 'live', 'Miss', 'Day', 'nod', 'just', 'how', 'ahead', 'time', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'times.The', 'writing', 'not', 'always', 'consistent', 'performers', 'give', 'then', 'Miss', 'Day', 'always', 'natural', 'real', 'delight', 'watch', 'believe', 'are', 'always', 'rooting', 'her.While', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Show', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'uproarious', 'side-splitting', 'comedy', 'cutting', 'edge', 'writing', 'was', 'consistently', 'warm', 'charming', 'amusing', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'throwback', 'era', 'when', 'raunch', 'smut', 'were', 'not', 'needed', 'satisfy', 'audiences.The', 'only', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watching', 'fifth', 'season', 'reality', 'are', 'more', 'seasons', 'forthcoming', 'been', 'lovely', 'stroll', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'reminder', 'why', 'Doris', 'Day', 'more', '65', 'years', 'professional', 'debut', 'delight', 'audiences']",The Doris Day Show - Season 5

Season 5 has a little too much romance at times for me personally, but obviously that kind of thing is geared toward the women viewers. Of course her boyfriend has to be a doctor which even in this time period was getting to be a tired cliche, even if he does have long hair and sideburns haha. OK, that gets the negatives out of the way. The best part of course is that Doris is there in all her dazzling stardom and super-charm and that raises everything higher than a lesser star would manage.
