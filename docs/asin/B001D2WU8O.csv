Even the beginning is disturbing, with the 911 phone call, and, well I don't wanna give away too much, but it really sets the tone for the rest of the film. It starts off quiet, dramatic, and kinda creepy, and right when the girl in the mask asks ""Is Tamara home?"", you know some scary stuff is gonna go down. One of the most subtle creepy scenes is when the guy in the mask (the one on the cover) has his head peeking out of the dark hallway. That still creeps me out. That same phrase repeating over and over on that phonograph when it gets knocked over is also still haunting. The film gets more and more intense and finally it becomes big on terror without becoming extremely loud, except for the screams. Later, you're on the edge of your seat, especially when it passes the 1 hour mark. The ending is also disturbing. ""The Strangers"" haunts you long after you see it.

The director only has a few tricks in his bag and he uses them ad nauseam as this film crawls its way through its second half.Nothing makes much sense. You think these ""strangers"" must be ghosts or something, considering their ability to teleport and their apparent psychic abilities when it comes to tracking their victims and predicting their every move. But no, they are allegedly normal human beings. The logistics that would have to be involved in their plans are just...beyond belief. Unless they are aliens with advanced technologies and the director just decided not to tell us.None of this is helped by the fact that our main characters are incredibly stupid, constantly finding reasons to separate that beggar belief. ""Yeah, some maniac just axed his way through the front doors, and these masked murderers are constantly teleporting in and out of our house at will anyway, but you stay here while I go out to the Ol Spooky Barn(tm) and see if the ol ham radio works"". That's not even an exaggeration. But to be fair, nothing these characters decided to do would work out as ""the strangers"" would simply teleport behind them.Don't buy the hype about this film being old fashioned atmospheric ""psychological terror"".

There is something about the reality and real-world possibility of it that makes me uncomfortable; all one has to do is scan the newspapers to realize that these types of things do happen, and could happen to you.  So rather than being entertaining, I sometimes seem these types of flicks as a vicarious experience of something I don't want to experience.  This movie is a little different though.  For some inexplicable reason, there is a tiny enough separation between the reality of torment and what these people go through.

1178707,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001D2WU8O,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","If you are looking for a mindless horror film that will shake you to your core and scare the pants off of you, then `The Strangers' is right up your ally.  The film seriously had me shaking in my bed sheets and I actually lost a lot of sleep last night because of this movie, so I can honestly say that the scare factor here is very high.  Sadly, it doesn't back up those goods with anything remotely intelligent.  The big reveal at the end is rather disappointing, but I won't spoil it (although I've noticed that a few reviewers already have).The film opens with two beautiful people driving to a cabin in the woods.  Clich&eacute;, I know.  That beautiful couple is Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, who play Kristin and James.  They are already in sour moods beings that James just proposed to Kristen, who turned him down.  The cabin, which belongs to James's parents, is not really an ideal location now, beings that it has been decorated with flowers and stocked with champagne in celebration of the proposal.  Almost immediately after arriving though, their focus is shifted when a strange young woman knocks on the front door.  She's looking for someone who doesn't live there.  The couple shrugs off the incident and decides to move on with the evening, but when James ventures out for cigarettes things get serious.  The knocking returns, and soon Kristen realizes that their evening is going to be far from pleasant, and it's not because of the proposal.I was very impressed with Bertino's direction of this film.  The scares provided are not your typical gory massacres, but they are wisely constructed thrills delivered by the right music, the right lighting and the right focus, and by focus I mean `camera focus', as in a masked man resting out of focus at the far end of the frame.I'm getting chills just thinking about it.The films first half is extremely successful in getting under your skin.  With Kristen alone in the house and the masked people outside your skin starts to crawl with genuine terror.  When James gets back things start to pick up pace, which kills the creepy a little bit, for a while at least.  Once Kristen is left on her own again though, things return back to their original terror and we are taken by storm with genuine bouts of fear.  This is a true testament to Liv Tyler's grasp of the genre.  She understands how to register pure terror on her face without delving into clich&eacute; or even campy reactions.  She is petrified, and it shows.Like I said, the ending is a disappointment.  We are waiting for this huge reveal and when it comes it fails to really make a dent.  I seriously was thinking ""this is it?""  I really was expecting something a little more, what's the word, powerful.  I've seen this same `ending' before, but with a little more thought behind it, so without that extra 'thought' this ending feels rather lazy.  So, in closing, the thrills are there but the brains are not.  Sometimes we just need a little scare.  If that's the case, dig into this one.  If you want something a little more intelligent then look elsewhere.",4,"The ending feels like a cop-out, but it delivers enough thrills along the way to make up for it...",1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,3088,"['are', 'looking', 'mindless', 'horror', 'film', 'will', 'shake', 'core', 'scare', 'pants', 'then', 'Strangers', 'right', 'ally', 'film', 'seriously', 'had', 'shaking', 'bed', 'sheets', 'actually', 'lost', 'lot', 'sleep', 'last', 'night', 'movie', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'scare', 'factor', 'here', 'very', 'high', 'Sadly', ""n't"", 'back', 'up', 'goods', 'anything', 'remotely', 'intelligent', 'big', 'reveal', 'end', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'few', 'reviewers', 'already', 'have', '.The', 'film', 'opens', 'two', 'beautiful', 'people', 'driving', 'cabin', 'woods', 'Clich', 'eacute', 'know', 'beautiful', 'couple', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'who', 'play', 'Kristin', 'James', 'are', 'already', 'sour', 'moods', 'beings', 'James', 'just', 'proposed', 'Kristen', 'who', 'turned', 'down', 'cabin', 'James', 'parents', 'not', 'really', 'ideal', 'location', 'now', 'beings', 'been', 'decorated', 'flowers', 'stocked', 'champagne', 'celebration', 'proposal', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'arriving', 'focus', 'shifted', 'when', 'strange', 'young', 'woman', 'front', 'door', 'looking', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'live', 'there', 'couple', 'incident', 'move', 'evening', 'when', 'James', 'ventures', 'out', 'cigarettes', 'things', 'get', 'serious', 'knocking', 'returns', 'soon', 'Kristen', 'evening', 'going', 'be', 'far', 'pleasant', 'not', 'proposal.I', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Bertino', 'direction', 'film', 'scares', 'provided', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'gory', 'massacres', 'are', 'wisely', 'constructed', 'thrills', 'delivered', 'right', 'music', 'right', 'lighting', 'right', 'focus', 'focus', 'mean', 'camera', 'focus', 'masked', 'man', 'resting', 'focus', 'far', 'end', 'frame.I', ""'m"", 'getting', 'chills', 'just', 'thinking', 'it.The', 'films', 'first', 'half', 'extremely', 'successful', 'getting', 'skin', 'Kristen', 'alone', 'house', 'masked', 'people', 'skin', 'crawl', 'genuine', 'terror', 'When', 'James', 'back', 'things', 'start', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'creepy', 'little', 'bit', 'while', 'least', 'Once', 'Kristen', 'left', 'own', 'again', 'things', 'return', 'back', 'original', 'terror', 'are', 'taken', 'storm', 'genuine', 'bouts', 'fear', 'true', 'testament', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'grasp', 'genre', 'how', 'register', 'pure', 'terror', 'face', 'delving', 'clich', 'eacute', 'even', 'campy', 'reactions', 'petrified', 'said', 'ending', 'disappointment', 'are', 'waiting', 'huge', 'reveal', 'when', 'really', 'make', 'dent', 'seriously', 'was', 'thinking', 'really', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'word', 'powerful', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'ending', 'little', 'more', 'thought', 'so', 'extra', ""'thought"", 'ending', 'feels', 'rather', 'lazy', 'So', 'closing', 'thrills', 'are', 'there', 'brains', 'are', 'not', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'need', 'little', 'scare', 'case', 'dig', 'one', 'want', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'intelligent', 'then', 'look', 'elsewhere']",N/A

I don't know the story this movie is based on but it is quite interesting story never the less. You can easily skip the first twenty minutes because nothing really happens and it's quite boring. Then a knock at the door with a girl is looking for her friend at 4 am in the morning; That might seem strange but the fact that the house the couple is staying on a is a deserted road with no other houses in what appears to be miles. She turns away and thats when the good stuff hits, well sort of. Three masked intruders do all sorts of stuff to mess with this girl and her boyfriend comes back after getting a frantic call. One thing I thought was funny was his beautiful car was destoryed and he didnt seem to care one bit about it. The three intruders disappear on and off, almost acting like ghosts and playing tricks on the couple. The movie is only an hour and twenty eight minutes (unrated edition) and it is pretty well paced but some things just dont add up. A unique part of the film is there is little speaking and it relys heavily on sounds. Expect for the girl that shows up at the door, you never see the rest of the killers faces.

Yes, this was another horror movie ruined by the middle mark, and ruined even more by a cheap ending and being branded with the 'UNRATED' label, despite it not being much longer than the standard version, and the two being nearly identical.Basic story: a young couple end up stranded in a secluded country home at night after their relationship is pretty much over (right after leaving a wedding no less). They try to make it through the night after three strangers begin to lurk around the home, and one even gets inside, unnoticed until it's too late. The former lovers now have to survive, but with seemingly no one else around to help them, and without much to fight off the attackers.'not much of an original plot, but it's how the movie's presented that makes it work. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman have excellent chemistry together and their characters make decisions that most people would in the same situation. For the most part, they don't make cliche horror movie choices. One of the first things they do to guard themselves is back off into a corner of one room while armed and wait for someone to come at them. The tension is incredible during this scene, and it's one that I could watch a few more times and still get the same feeling I had the first time I saw it. Because of where they are, the couple can't do a whole lot, especially since the home they're in doesn't have much to work with. Whenever they're able to get away for a few minutes, they try their best wherever they are, be it a shed, kitchen, or even a by a car. Even when they did make some kind of dumb choices, they weren't that bad. Why not just call the police? 'hard to do when you've got 3 people who planned out this attack and made sure you wouldn't be able to before the real fun starts.But about halfway through the movie, things get pretty boring. Running from x location to x location, hiding for x minutes, the tension that the first half had ends up being killed because they overdo it. Despite being on the edge of my seat early on, I was about ready to fall asleep once they left the house and tried their luck outside for a while. ...even typing that just now I yawned. And the ending is nothing short of cheap. I'd describe it without ruining anything, but it's hard to because of how basic the 'scare' was they were going for. Where the final scare can be good in movies like [REC], this one has the kind of lame ending that plagued another movie that could've been good- Paranormal Activity. It sucks too because this movie was going somewhere, but it almost seems like they got a new writer for the second half of the script, or somehow ran out of ideas. All that build up for nothing?? Come on guys. This could've been a modern classic!One more thing that hampers the experience is the picture quality. Watching this on a good tv won't do much because of the 'muddy' effect the picture has. If it was done for style, fine, but outside shots look pretty bad, and with everything taking place at night, it's hard to see if there really is anyone behind someone or not. The audio's pretty good at least, and if you have a good sound system, crank that baby up. Whenever the house makes a sound, you'll hear it, from the smallest creak to the faintest footstep.Special features? None really. You get 2 deleted scenes that were deleted for a reason, and a decent featurette that covers a lot of the production of the movie. It's informative, but nothing that the average horror fan will get much out of unless they're interested in making their own movies.Even with the huge problems, The Strangers was better than most of the other horror movies that came out that same year. It's just a shame that before it's over, I didn't care any more. And I can't stress how lame the ending was. I can't help but wonder if there was an alternate ending, one that wouldn't have killed the movie.",2,"Well, we'll always have the trailer to remember.",1274227200,"05 19, 2010",2010,4325,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Strangers', 'was', 'stunned', 'Everything', 'was', 'done', 'perfectly', 'once', 'trailer', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'else', 'rarely', '3', 'strangers', 'standing', 'there', 'watching', 'couple', 'was', 'chilling', 'image', 'knew', 'something', 'really', 'awful', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'movie', 'almost', 'match', 'rad-ness', 'trailer', 'halfway', 'mark', 'Yes', 'was', 'horror', 'movie', 'ruined', 'middle', 'mark', 'ruined', 'even', 'more', 'cheap', 'ending', 'being', 'branded', ""'UNRATED"", 'label', 'not', 'being', 'much', 'longer', 'standard', 'version', 'two', 'being', 'nearly', 'identical.Basic', 'story', 'young', 'couple', 'end', 'up', 'stranded', 'secluded', 'country', 'home', 'night', 'relationship', 'pretty', 'much', 'right', 'leaving', 'wedding', 'no', 'less', 'try', 'make', 'night', 'three', 'strangers', 'begin', 'lurk', 'home', 'one', 'even', 'inside', 'unnoticed', 'too', 'late', 'former', 'lovers', 'now', 'have', 'survive', 'seemingly', 'one', 'else', 'help', 'much', 'fight', 'off', 'attackers', ""'not"", 'much', 'original', 'plot', 'how', 'movie', 'presented', 'work', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'have', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'together', 'characters', 'make', 'decisions', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'same', 'situation', 'most', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'cliche', 'horror', 'movie', 'choices', 'One', 'first', 'things', 'do', 'guard', 'back', 'off', 'corner', 'one', 'room', 'armed', 'wait', 'someone', 'come', 'tension', 'incredible', 'scene', 'one', 'could', 'watch', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'still', 'get', 'same', 'feeling', 'had', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'where', 'are', 'couple', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'especially', 'home', ""'re"", ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'Whenever', ""'re"", 'able', 'get', 'away', 'few', 'minutes', 'try', 'best', 'are', 'be', 'shed', 'kitchen', 'even', 'car', 'Even', 'when', 'did', 'make', 'kind', 'dumb', 'choices', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'call', 'police', 'do', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', '3', 'people', 'who', 'planned', 'out', 'attack', 'made', 'sure', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'real', 'fun', 'starts.But', 'halfway', 'movie', 'things', 'get', 'pretty', 'boring', 'Running', 'x', 'location', 'x', 'location', 'hiding', 'x', 'minutes', 'tension', 'first', 'half', 'had', 'up', 'being', 'killed', 'overdo', 'being', 'edge', 'seat', 'early', 'was', 'about', 'ready', 'fall', 'asleep', 'left', 'house', 'tried', 'luck', 'while', 'even', 'typing', 'just', 'now', 'yawned', 'ending', 'nothing', 'short', 'cheap', ""'d"", 'describe', 'ruining', 'anything', 'hard', 'how', 'basic', ""'scare"", 'was', 'were', 'going', 'Where', 'final', 'scare', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'movies', '[', 'REC', ']', 'one', 'kind', 'lame', 'ending', 'plagued', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'good-', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'too', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'somewhere', 'almost', 'got', 'new', 'writer', 'second', 'half', 'script', 'somehow', 'ran', 'ideas', 'build', 'up', 'nothing', 'Come', 'guys', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'modern', 'classic', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'experience', 'picture', 'quality', 'Watching', 'good', 'tv', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', ""'muddy"", 'effect', 'picture', 'was', 'done', 'style', 'fine', 'outside', 'shots', 'look', 'pretty', 'bad', 'everything', 'taking', 'place', 'night', 'hard', 'see', 'really', 'anyone', 'someone', 'not', 'audio', 'pretty', 'good', 'least', 'have', 'good', 'sound', 'system', 'crank', 'up', 'house', 'sound', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'smallest', 'creak', 'faintest', 'footstep.Special', 'features', 'None', 'really', 'get', '2', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'deleted', 'reason', 'decent', 'featurette', 'lot', 'production', 'movie', 'informative', 'nothing', 'average', 'horror', 'fan', 'will', 'get', 'much', ""'re"", 'interested', 'making', 'own', 'movies.Even', 'huge', 'problems', 'Strangers', 'was', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'year', 'just', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'how', 'lame', 'ending', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'was', 'alternate', 'ending', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'killed', 'movie']",N/A

On one hand the premise is terrifying--a home invasion; being attacked by strangers in your own home for reasons that are not apparent.  On the other hand, it was hard to sustain a home invasion scenario, a very simple concept, being padded out to last an hour and a half.  It just seemed to go on much to long.  I found myself wanting to look at my watch about 2/3 of the way through and that's never a good thing.  I also found it a little hard to believe a home invasion scenario lasting all night long and well into the morning of the next day, and I'm pretty quick to suspend disbelief in movies.Anyway, the film, although a little slow and padded as it was, is disturbing and terrifying at its core and is definitely worth seeing, if only once.Does anybody know what footage is unrated?  I hate these ""unrated"" cuts.  If you do some research you'll usually find that the unrated cut is maybe a minute longer than the theatrical cut... probably nothing more than a minute of dialogue or a scene of someone picking their nose that was cut from the film for pacing and therefore wasn't seen by the MPAA when submitted for rating.

How about the great acting from *all* the characters (the good and bad guys!)Right from the very beginning I thought the movie would be worth my time because of the slow build-up of character development and storyline.  The man and woman obviously aren't going through the best of times as far as their relationship is concerned.The thing that made the movie so much of a quality suspense was the way the bad guys were actually IN the house while the man and woman were being terrorized, but the man and woman didn't realize it at first.  The bad guys were constantly making noises in the house, writing words on the walls, and finding ways to mess with the people (and driving them insane while doing so).Imagine looking outside a window and notice someone standing in your yard, looking directly at you?  Something like that happens here.  Absolutely scary.So yes, this movie did its job, and did it fairly well, but I've seen movies that disturbed me in a way that made me wonder just how sick human beings can be if pushed far enough.

1178717,AT57B36BHDQ00,B001D2WU8O,Big Mike,"[1, 1]","The Strangers is one the most unsettling, harrowing, suspenseful, tense, nerve-wracking and vastly underrated horror/thriller films that I have ever seen. It takes plenty of time to allow the ever-building sense of dread to mount up until it becomes almost unbearable. I personally find this far more effective than the usual slasher type of horror film that mostly only revels in gory make-up effects and thus drowns the suspense. You know pretty much what is going to happen and it makes it predictable. In The Strangers, even the most ordinary things such as a country music song, a turntable, a car, a nice house and a fireplace can take on a real sense of menace. You know something that is wrong and are not sure just where the danger is going to come from or when it is going to strike. Once it really starts, it doesn't let up on the viewer until the end. A film like this tends to stay with me much longer than a slasher film. One of the most frightening aspects of The Strangers is that something of this nature could actually happen. It never stretches the believability to where you think to yourself, this just couldn't happen to me. Liv Tyler is marvelous as Kristen and she never fails to make her character realistic and sympathetic. There is quite a bit of violence of a pretty graphic nature in The Strangers, but the use of it is never at the expense of the suspense or the tension. You won't ever feel quite as safe in your own home again after seeing The Strangers.

What you probably didn't expect when you opened your expensive looking box was a handful of gravel and the smell of cat urine. That pretty well describes the disappointment that you'll feel with The Strangers, one of the greatest previews ever made.The premise is straightforward. A couple recently returned from a wedding, and reeling from a refusal of marriage, stops at a remote house for the night. What was supposed to be sunshine and romance is instead an awkward and drawn out shuffle of two people who can barely stand to look at one another. Then a knock at the door, a woman looking for her friend Tamara, which sets off a series of startle scares and repititous spooky scenes, as the couple are set upon by three masked assailants.The let downs begin with the characters themselves, who apparently barely made it out of the 3rd grade. While many people bemoan the stupidity of characters in slashers, these two hopeless souls and their erstwhile allies are so mind boggingly inept that its a wonder the villians don't leave them in peace. Hunters want prey, and tormenting Tyler and Speedman was about as challenging as kicking a pair of still blind puppies.The set is spooky, though lighting and setup make for some poorly shot scenes. Overall, it was a great design for a slasher pic, though it was poorly handled. The sound and dialogue are okay, and the costumes for the villians are definitely unsettling given their relative passivity. You don't expect Pikachu or Hello Kitty to try and drive a knife into your guts.The story line is rather fast paced, and there are some very spooky moments, the majority of which you saw in the trailer, but expectations were far higher for this piece, and it ends up being a remake of Friday the 13th, an empty slasher following people with more alcohol in their system than brains, with a disappointing, predictable ending and a hollow message of evil wearing many faces.",2,Insipid and Dull,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,2142,"['were', 'most', 'who', 'enjoy', 'horror', 'movies', 'probably', 'looked', 'forward', 'Strangers', 'kid', 'Christmas', 'day', 'running', 'down', 'living', 'room', 'filled', 'brightly', 'wrapped', 'presents', 'dazzilingly', 'lit', 'tree', 'What', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'when', 'opened', 'expensive', 'looking', 'box', 'was', 'handful', 'gravel', 'smell', 'cat', 'urine', 'pretty', 'well', 'disappointment', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'Strangers', 'one', 'greatest', 'previews', 'ever', 'made.The', 'premise', 'straightforward', 'couple', 'recently', 'returned', 'wedding', 'reeling', 'refusal', 'marriage', 'remote', 'house', 'night', 'What', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'sunshine', 'romance', 'instead', 'awkward', 'drawn', 'out', 'shuffle', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'stand', 'look', 'one', 'Then', 'knock', 'door', 'woman', 'looking', 'friend', 'Tamara', 'off', 'series', 'startle', 'scares', 'repititous', 'spooky', 'scenes', 'couple', 'are', 'set', 'three', 'masked', 'assailants.The', 'let', 'downs', 'begin', 'characters', 'who', 'apparently', 'barely', 'made', '3rd', 'grade', 'many', 'people', 'bemoan', 'stupidity', 'characters', 'slashers', 'two', 'hopeless', 'souls', 'erstwhile', 'allies', 'are', 'so', 'mind', 'boggingly', 'inept', 'wonder', 'villians', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'peace', 'Hunters', 'want', 'prey', 'tormenting', 'Tyler', 'Speedman', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'challenging', 'kicking', 'pair', 'still', 'blind', 'puppies.The', 'set', 'spooky', 'lighting', 'setup', 'make', 'poorly', 'shot', 'scenes', 'Overall', 'was', 'great', 'design', 'slasher', 'pic', 'was', 'poorly', 'handled', 'sound', 'dialogue', 'are', 'okay', 'costumes', 'villians', 'are', 'definitely', 'unsettling', 'given', 'relative', 'passivity', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Pikachu', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'try', 'drive', 'knife', 'guts.The', 'story', 'line', 'rather', 'fast', 'paced', 'are', 'very', 'spooky', 'moments', 'majority', 'saw', 'trailer', 'expectations', 'were', 'far', 'higher', 'piece', 'up', 'being', 'remake', 'Friday', '13th', 'empty', 'slasher', 'following', 'people', 'more', 'alcohol', 'system', 'brains', 'disappointing', 'predictable', 'ending', 'hollow', 'message', 'evil', 'wearing', 'many']",N/A

Yes, ""The Strangers"" does make use of familiar plot devices common to several horror or terror films.  Plot devices, of course, are necessary to movies, plays, and opera.  There is an answer as to why the cell phones don't work: if they did, 911 would have been called with a SWAT team swooping in, and the movie would have been over in 20 minutes! It's not about the devices, it's about execution around the devices.  This film really executes.I found ""The Strangers"" to be highly suspenseful.  This is a terror film, as opposed to a standard horror film.  The gore is kept to a minimum, so if you are looking for on-camera decapitations and the like, this is not your film.  If you are looking for edge-of-your-seat suspense, you will love it.  Like other reviewers, I won't spoil this movie for you by discussing the plot.I knocked off one star for one issue.  In one scene, Kristen falls in a ditch and supposedly sprains her ankle.  It's bad enough that she has to crawl.  In the next scene, she is walking fine.  In a subsequent scene, she is back to the limp.  I was surprised to see this when the attention to detail was otherwise so sharp.Director Brian Bertino got the most of the set, the lighting, sound effects, and his principal actors Liv Tyler (Kristen) and Scott Speedman (James). This is a very scary movie, where the victims are trapped no matter which way they turn.

The premise is fairly straightforward:  a couple gets attacked by some murderers in a secluded house during the night.  There's plenty of suspense and moments that will make you jump.  So in that sense, this movie is worth a viewing but it's not something you'll want to buy and watch over and over again.Below may include some spoilers:So the film starts with a prologue about how many violent crimes there are each year and how this film is based on actual events.  After doing a little researching here is what I found.  Yeah, the film is based on actual events...in that people are victims of home invasion and murder and that people probably are killed in South Carolina in February.  Aside from that, nothing in this movie is factual which is fine but don't make the claim that it's a true story.I also found that the ""scary"" moments were too scripted; like there was no reason for someone to just jump out from nowhere for the sole purpose of scaring the viewing audience.  I guess my point is that don't just have people jump out in front of the camera for no reason.The plot was also a bit thin.  Ok so this couple is in a secluded house and they become the prey in some sick game by these killers.  Why?  The killers were far too devoted for this to simply be a random act of violence.I'm also not sure why when the couple found the shotgun and figured out how to use it, why they didn't just remain in the house instead of deciding to split up and go in opposite directions away from the house.  Hmmm, what's going to happen here I wonder...And apparently, the whole plot was dependent on the fact that Liv Tyler's cell phone needed to be recharged.  Had her phone been charged, they could have called the police and been just fine.  I'm pretty sure the killers didn't somehow drain the phone as part of their plot.Also, the last scene...the killers stopping and talking to the Jehovah's Witnesses...was there supposed to be some profound point in this or was it just there because...?Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this film.  It could have been better and honestly...why do film makers feel the need to tell us that the movie we're about to watch is based on true events?

Thomas ""Wanna be Critic""","[71, 81]","I recently had watched this movie, and I must say that without question this movie is the scariest, and creepiest movie I have ever seen. In fact it was so scarry that I slept all the lights on the last two nights, and I keep a baseball bat by my night stand.I am not going to recap the movie ad nauseum the way some of the other reviews here have already done, however I will give a high level perspective of why this movie is so good at being scarry.1. There are no ghouls, ghosts, vampires, and demons. The premise of this movie is litteraly one group of people taking advantage of other people.2. The costumes used by the strangers were simple, and eloquent. Exactly the kind of stuff one could pick up at any party store or costume shop. I feel as though this added a whole other level of realism to the movie.3. Overall creepiness of the type of harrasment the strangers inflicted on the kristen, and james.Some negatives that I observed about the movie:1. James and Kristen making some stupid decisions, that would have any person with a brain scratching their heads...ie...splitting up when you have these psychopaths coming at you from all directions.2. The strangers violating the laws of physics by being able to subtly and quickly sneak into a space and scrawl messages across the walls, windows of a room to further torment our protaganists, and never ever be seen or heard by James and Kristen. This just doesnt seem plausible to me.3. The ending didnt really give me closure.With all that, the movie was highly effective at serving its purpose which was to freak me out, and entertain me, which it did for it's entire 80 minute running time.I highly recommend this movie, and am only giving this movie 4 stars instead of 5 for the reasons I state above.",4,Easily the scariest movie I have ever seen.....,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,1768,"['recently', 'had', 'watched', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'question', 'movie', 'scariest', 'creepiest', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'scarry', 'slept', 'lights', 'last', 'two', 'nights', 'keep', 'baseball', 'bat', 'night', 'stand.I', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'recap', 'movie', 'ad', 'way', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'however', 'will', 'give', 'high', 'level', 'perspective', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'being', 'scarry.1', 'are', 'ghouls', 'ghosts', 'vampires', 'demons', 'premise', 'movie', 'litteraly', 'one', 'group', 'people', 'taking', 'advantage', 'other', 'people.2', 'costumes', 'used', 'strangers', 'were', 'simple', 'eloquent', 'Exactly', 'kind', 'stuff', 'one', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'party', 'store', 'costume', 'shop', 'feel', 'added', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'realism', 'movie.3', 'Overall', 'creepiness', 'type', 'harrasment', 'strangers', 'inflicted', 'kristen', 'james.Some', 'negatives', 'observed', 'movie:1', 'James', 'Kristen', 'making', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'would', 'have', 'person', 'brain', 'scratching', 'heads', 'ie', 'splitting', 'up', 'when', 'have', 'psychopaths', 'coming', 'directions.2', 'strangers', 'violating', 'laws', 'physics', 'being', 'able', 'subtly', 'quickly', 'sneak', 'space', 'scrawl', 'messages', 'walls', 'windows', 'room', 'further', 'torment', 'protaganists', 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'seen', 'heard', 'James', 'Kristen', 'just', 'doesnt', 'seem', 'plausible', 'me.3', 'ending', 'didnt', 'really', 'give', 'closure.With', 'movie', 'was', 'highly', 'effective', 'serving', 'purpose', 'was', 'freak', 'out', 'entertain', 'did', 'entire', '80', 'minute', 'running', 'time.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'am', 'only', 'giving', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'reasons', 'state']",N/A

K,"[1, 3]","THE STRANGERS**  Out of 5Release Date- May 30th, 2008Running Time- 85-MinutesRating- RWriter/Director- Bryan BertinoStarring- Liv Tyler & Scott SpeedmanThe Strangers was a nice attempt, but it just falls a little short as a whole. The Strangers is bound to draw many comparisons to the French flick Them released back in 2006. Actually many people thought this was a remake since they follow the same exact plot. According to the filmmaker Bryan Bertino The Strangers was written prior to the release of Them. But both these movies are a lot a like so it's easy to understand why so many thought this was a remake.The Strangers has the right idea, but it just never fully works and at times can be a bit on the boring side. The biggest problem I had with The Strangers was the weak screenplay written by Bryan Bertino. While I wouldn't say the movie is poorly written the characters lack any depth and are quite boring and not interesting at all. If you are making a splatter flick those things can easily be overlooked, but when making a movie that relies on suspense and tension faceless characters makes for a faceless movie; The Strangers is sort of like the last act of a slasher movie; it's pretty much one long chase scene with nothing else.You never really get a feel of the characters all that much and when they are in danger, which they for most of the running time it's hard to really feel the urgency since we don't know much about the characters and therefore there's no attachment to them, which really takes away from any possible suspense and tension. Again if The Strangers was just a splatter flick none of this would matter, but the goal of the movie was to be suspense and tension filled and with faceless victims the movie just doesn't work due to that.As director Bryan Bertino does fair a little bit better; there is some decent suspense in certain spots, but due to the weak characters these scenes don't play out as well as they could have. The Strangers though was well made, but the execution was just a bit off. Running at 85-minutes the movie is short and it gets going rather quickly. But it starts to run out of steam due to the fact it's pretty much the same scene playing out over and over again. The pacing how ever isn't bad. After a slow start things to pick up quickly, but just sort of lacks, which again is due to the characters.Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman are the main characters and both are pretty good actors I suppose. I haven't seen a lot of their work, but what I have seen I don't really have any complaints. But in The Strangers their performances weren't bad, but just really boring. I suppose more of the blame can be placed with the script since neither really have anything interesting to say, but their performances were just sort of boring. I know this is a clich&eacute;d thing to say, but they did seem rather bored.The Strangers is gets very mixed reviews from the viewers; some hail it as an instant classic and others claim it's a boring flick. I understand both sides of the argument. Despite my complaints I didn't hate the movie, but I was never really hooked either. There was potential, but the lack of interesting characters and the fact the movie begins to repeat itself drags it down. Like I said the movie was well made and there was some decent suspense and tension, but when all was said and done it never fully works. The masks worn by the villains how ever were really cool and creepy. Again The Strangers just has too many flaws that drag it down, but at only 85-minutes it moves rather quickly and while I can't fully recommend it, but you can do a lot worse.

1178743,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B001D2WU8O,David Girod,"[4, 5]","""The Strangers"" can be a fun horror film, as long as you have no problem leaving your reasoning and sensibility at the door. As far as tension-filled horror flicks where innocent victims are terrorized by madmen go, ""The Strangers"" is about on par with the Luke Wilson movie ""Vacancy"". You've seen the basic storyline before, ""Innocent couple attracts the attention of homicidal nutjobs"". It's one of those movies that builds suspense by having the protagonists choosing to make the stupidest decisions available to them at the time. Go investigate that strange noise, open your door at 4am to a complete stranger, make sure there is not one working phone in the house, run out into the darkened woods and fall down, walking into a house after someone shoots out the windshield on your car. If you like movies where you scream at the TV because the heroes/heroine are dumber than a bag full of hammers, you will love ""The Strangers"".I do think that the masked trio of nutjobs in ""The Strangers"" were pretty scary. Whoever created the masks for these homicidal midnight callers really should get bonus bucks for creating such frightening images. The ""leader"" of the strangers, wearing that pillow-case mask is truly a frightening figure, as are the china-doll masked accomplices. The visage of these three posing like ""Michael Myers"" outside of various windows of the home is geniunely creepy.So while ""The Strangers"" isn't a great movie, it is entertaining. Clocking in at just over 80 minutes, there are few times where you will jump, and while many consider these ""cheap scares"", I had fun with it. Just don't expect too much and you will have a good time.",3,"""Vacancy"" - The Home Game",1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,1658,"['Strangers', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'horror', 'film', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'problem', 'leaving', 'reasoning', 'sensibility', 'door', 'As', 'far', 'tension-filled', 'horror', 'flicks', 'where', 'innocent', 'victims', 'are', 'terrorized', 'madmen', 'go', 'Strangers', 'about', 'par', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'movie', 'Vacancy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'basic', 'storyline', 'Innocent', 'couple', 'attention', 'homicidal', 'nutjobs', 'one', 'movies', 'builds', 'suspense', 'having', 'protagonists', 'choosing', 'make', 'stupidest', 'decisions', 'available', 'time', 'Go', 'investigate', 'strange', 'noise', 'open', 'door', '4am', 'complete', 'stranger', 'make', 'sure', 'not', 'one', 'working', 'phone', 'house', 'run', 'out', 'darkened', 'woods', 'fall', 'down', 'walking', 'house', 'someone', 'shoots', 'out', 'windshield', 'car', 'like', 'movies', 'where', 'scream', 'TV', 'heroes/heroine', 'are', 'dumber', 'bag', 'full', 'hammers', 'will', 'love', 'Strangers', '.I', 'do', 'think', 'masked', 'trio', 'nutjobs', 'Strangers', 'were', 'pretty', 'scary', 'created', 'masks', 'homicidal', 'midnight', 'callers', 'really', 'should', 'get', 'bonus', 'bucks', 'creating', 'such', 'frightening', 'images', 'leader', 'strangers', 'wearing', 'pillow-case', 'mask', 'truly', 'frightening', 'figure', 'are', 'china-doll', 'masked', 'accomplices', 'visage', 'three', 'posing', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'various', 'windows', 'home', 'geniunely', 'creepy.So', 'Strangers', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'Clocking', 'just', '80', 'minutes', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'will', 'jump', 'many', 'consider', 'cheap', 'scares', 'had', 'fun', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'time']",N/A

It makes you jump and doesn't let up until the end.Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman return to their remote retreat after a wedding. He has just proposed to her and been rejected. It's an inauspicious start to the night, though it's 4:00 am so, morning would be more apt. Their ""make up make out"" is interrupted by a knock at the door.Thereafter, they are under siege by a trio of strangers who toy with them throughout the night. There are moments of sheer terror. A scene in which Liv Tyler is getting a drink, the camera pans and we see a hooded man watching her from inside the home, sets the tone and keeps it in overdrive. Even when you're expecting a shock you're shocked.The acting is superb. Liv Tyler can look scared - really scared - when she needs to. Scott Speedman is just as convincing in his own way. The rest of the cast just needs to be there to keep the action going and they do a great job of it.I noted in a couple of reviews that people thought one or two things far-fetched, such as when a friend arrives and sees the carnage. Rather than leave, he enters the house and...But I think you can forgive those smaller slip-ups because the rest is quite believable and the ending is exactly as it should be. As day breaks and the couple are sitting tied to chairs they ask ""why are you doing this"". The answer is a perfect footnote to so much random violence one hears about today.The story is supposedly based on true events. How much I don't know, but I think one of the scarier aspects of the film is that is is plausible. It's not a dream. There are no vampires. It's a group of psychos out to terrorize a couple.They end up terrorizing the viewer too. I think much of it has to do the incredible direction and an absence of special effects and ""in your face"" gore that so many people accept as ""horror"" these days.

1178756,A73DFWJE0CGY6,B001D2WU8O,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[2, 3]","This movie, of course, starts out purporting to be taken from a true story - a conceit used in horror stories for years, all the way back to ""Last House on the Left"" (which, really, was more grindhouse than horror). The young couple in search of solitude for a night away with each other become the unwitting victims of a sadistic, silent group of people.James and Kristen (Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler) are a couple obviously in love with each other; but apparently she isn't ready for the big move, because at the outset, she has just turned down his marriage proposal. Here is where it would have been better for both of them if they had just decided to go two ways for a while, but perhaps to put a cap on things, they return to their remote cabin in the woods for one last night together.Things go horribly wrong when, for the most elemental of reasons (divulged at the end of the film), a group of sadistic strangers appears at their door. Initially the encounter is merely unsettlingly odd; the girl at the door is asking for Tamara, who doesn't live there. (Who in their right mind would open their door in the middle of the night anyway? My first move - if my cell phone was working - would be to call the authorities.) James and Kristen consider the incident odd, but close the door and seemingly go back to mulling over Kristen's refusal.James, clearly strained at being in her presence, opts to go to town for cigarettes. Any excuse to bolt, I suppose. While he is gone, the strangers - who appear to be a guy and two girls - move in and begin terrorizing Kristen. Of course, none of the phones in the house are working - ain't it always the way? I found myself yelling, ""Stay in a lighted room! Make them come to you!"" when, predictably, she begins searching the house for intruders.James returns, and although he is armed with a pretty lethal-looking gun and our assailants seem to only have knives and the power of suggestion working for them, they get the upper hand time and time again. It is a very psychological thriller; the lovers are gradually broken down to terror-stricken, blubbering victims without any clear thought on what to do to get away. I thought Kristen was on to something when she discovers a two-way radio in an outbuilding (what are the chances of that?) and briefly raises the authorities, only to lose connection.This sort of movie isn't what I usually indulge in, but I appreciate Liv Tyler's work and here she does an excellent job. You can really believe that she is terrified and at a total loss. Scott Speedman - who I had not previously been aware of - does a good job also, in a handsome-leading-man sort of way, to portray a man who feels like he should be able to figure this out but hasn't a clue. The bad guys, anonymously masked, were chillingly effective without using any dialogue until the end, and that itself, in its brevity, sent icewater down my spine.For its genre, this was a good yarn, though the ""true story"" bit is laughable.

In fact it is based on true events or at least something the director experienced or remembered from his childhood. You can say it is a rip off of the film ""Them"" [really good] all you want but I tend to believe what the director has to say and how he wrote this. This film was based on three different things it seems that lead to the director writing this.The film is based on an incident that happened when writer/director Bryan Bertino was a kid. One day some random people knocked on his door and his sister answered, they asked for some one who did not live there. Turns out later he found out they went around knocking on doors and if there was no answer they broke in. Also the director has stated that the book ""Helter Skelter"" helped in the penning of this. But there is also a real crime that happened in the Sierra Nevada Mountains known as the Keddie Cabin Murders of 1981. That is a creepy real life crime you should read up on, very chilling stuff.Any way the film follows a young couple who are having some romantic issues and are just returning home. After James leaves for a while some strangers show up at the door while Kristen is home alone. After asking for some one that isn't there they start to terrorize this poor girl. When James returns things heat up to an even more violent level as the strangers pick up the pace.I have to say Liv Tyler really did an excellent  job here as she had the hardest role of all to play. I personally think she did a marvelous job portraying both an emotionally detached girlfriend to Jason and also a women being mentally tortured. As for Jason, Scott Speedman does a good job here as well but Liv is the show stealer. The strangers are creepy as they should be. Bryan Bertino did a good job here in my opinion as a first time filmmaker. This film does a good job building tension and using the right amount of atmosphere. The score is great as well and plays a big part here.I had a good time with this one and would recommend it. I know that there are those who don't like it as much but I thought it was good. I say check it out because you may like it as well. Does it have problems, maybe, but that didn't hurt the film in my eyes.

Dowling,"[4, 5]","Seeing the trailers for ""The Strangers"", I was tantilized like everyone else, thinking this would be a really creepy, ""It could happen to you"" thriller.  A young couple being terrorized in the wee hours by masked intruders out for some thrill-killing?  Good stuff.  I was so disappointed by this movie!  It has a prologue which essentially gives away the ending, which was my first gripe.  The couple, played by Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler, are very annoying.  Don't get me wrong, I find both actors very liakble . . .but as characters in this claptrap, they suffer from a common syndrome among movie couples in thrillers.  they never really seem to talk or believe each other.  Speedman seems surprisingly unalarmed by the events, which I was hoping would lead to a delicious twist at the end, adding a double entandre to the title.  Nope.  The film borrows from every classic . . .""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Halloween"", ""In Cold Blood"", etc.  It's directed with style and oodles of atmosphere thanks to the cinematography and music by tomandandy.  However, the movie gets weighed down in its cliches and never taps into its very frightening premise in a primal way.  The characters fall down, get limping leg injuries, and as usual, the killers are master electricians, cutting power and devices that offer escape and help.  There are more plot-holes here than a wheel of Swiss cheese.  Look at the scene with Tyler's cell phone early on . . .does anyone have a cell that will not work even when you plug it into the charger regardless if the battery is weak or dead?The ending is the one moment that the film hints at what should have been a much scarier movie, as it is also the moment of relaization that everything that came before it was time-stalling prologue, which makes less sense as a story.  It was like the ending belonged in another movie.  A better one.  The actors are on their game in this scene and it's what elevated the rating by one star for me.  I just wish the rest of the movie had the balls to follow this premise more closely instead of boring me for 80 minutes to reach one moment of terror.The special features do not help.  Mostly the filmmakers and actors all pat themselves on the back, but it offers no insight and does not reference the ""true story"" it is based on.  Very disappointing.",2,Unrated?

Not being one for the constant barrage of thriller films (the 'Saw' Series, the endless vampire variations, 'I know what you did...', etc) this viewer hesitantly watched what could have been yet another exercise in blood and gore.  But surprise!  The story (based on a true incident in 2005 as outlined by an off camera narrator discussing the number of violent deaths in America each year before the film opens) is tight, credible, and deals more with the emotion of terror of the unknown than images of gore.  Kudos to writer/director  Bryan Bertino for finding the core of the macabre.  And it is true!James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) is driving his girlfriend Kristen MacKay (Liv Tyler) to the isolated summer home in the woods that James and his best friend Mike (Glenn Howerton) had earlier decorated with rose petals, candles and champagne in preparation for what was supposed to be a celebration of a marriage proposal.  Sadness prevails in the car as Kristen has turned James' proposal down.  They quietly enter the decorated house, and almost immediately begin to hear sounds outside and a door knock by a young girl apparently looking for a person not living in this house.  Kristen asks James to go out and get her cigarettes and the creepy action begins.  Three strangers each in masks terrify Kristen with noises, secretly entering the house, and creating a tense atmosphere until James returns.  At this point the story becomes an almost unbearable sequence of events: it is clear the strangers are out to murder James and Kristen.  Bound and beaten by the three strangers Kristen asks 'Why us? Why do you want to kill us?' and the simple answer from of the strangers is 'Because you're home'. The ending of the film could have been better handled by someone telling us the results of the night - the follow up to this true story.  But instead Bertino elects to keep the level of terror high.Peter Sova (cinematographer) finds the right amount of shadow and dark to keep us guessing and the musical score by tomandandy is pitch perfect.

1178763,A32CG0V371FRQ2,B001D2WU8O,GratedTopping,"[5, 5]","In this flick, its bare-plot just dealt with a couple at an isolated place being annoyed by three strangers who had an intent to kill (but wanted to scare them more first). This had no point, was entirely uninteresting, offers nothing new compared to other horror movies, contained no character development, and I didn't even see the hardly-terrorized couple as 'real people'. The situation had so many ridiculous moments that it was embarassingly funny and became one of the dullest movies of any genre.It tried to tell us at the start about how it was based on true events. Now, whenever you read anything like that, the most miniscule amount ofa real event could be used in the flick and all the rest can be fake. If a person took a dump in the movie and that is something that took place in the real history, then it can be 'based on a true story' and they aren't fully lying. I think most people believe the majority of everything is based on actual events in such tales, when the opposite is most likely because it is a movie script with an author.Here we go! I've written the above information before looking around and, lo and behold, I read details stating that this was based on a memory of the writer/director Brian Bertino. As a boy, he recalled a stranger came to the door asking for someone. Later, there were a lot of burglaries in the area. That's it! From such an incredibly miniscule 'story', it was stretched into the 'plot' of this movie. For all we know, that stranger could have been trying to find someone he hadn't seen in a long time and surprise. He didn't scare the writer/director and most-likely had nothing to do with the burglaries (which didn't even involve murders).We read at the end of the film that ""The brutal events that took place there are still not entirely known."" Really? Since the movie ends with the woman suddenly coming-to in fear after someone who found her touches her, are we to think that that she survived long enough to tell SOME of the tale? For there to be a movie, events had to come from her or the person who found her. If it was from that person, then the only true part of the flick would have been that at some time in history, a person came upon people who'd been attacked. Without knowing what part of the movie is based on actual events, people tend to think the majority really took place. The only true thing for this movie: it's fully fiction except that the writer encountered a stranger in his life.There is so little substance to this movie that writing more is a waste, but here I go with some various thoughts anyway.- The writer spoke of wanting to strip away many of the horror cliches so it doesn't get repetetive . . . but the movie's just filled with them.* couple is in the middle of nowhere and cell phones are not working; jump-scares; first, the bad-person is there then he's not (oooh ... where did he go?); a baddie is right behind you but nobody bothers to look even though he was just previously seen in that direction; someone stands in the distance just staring (shades of HALLOWEEN'S Michael Myers); woman decides to make a run for it and trips (nobody's ever tried THAT before)...startscrawling...one of the baddies appears behind her and she doesn't know it or behave in a manner that she expects it to happen (but it's okay because the stalker will just disappear for no reason except to make the movie longer and add fake tension); and at the end, we have some kids come upon the house and find the bodies...one starts to reach out for the woman, who suddenly perks up and screams while the movie ends (is she alive or not?); etc. *- The unrated version has approx. 2 minutes of added length, which consists of just one extra scene near the end that made no difference. In it, we see that the woman was also not fully expired...she hears the cellphone of the guy who was accidentally shot...she crawls to it....the masked-man returns, takes the phone and chooses to leave her still alive a bit. That's all.- The almost-husband is a moron. The woman told him that one of the strangers came into the place. He says that nobody came in. How could he be so certain and why in the world does he doubt her immediately for no reason? The woman's terrified and the man decides to leave her with the baddies (which he doesn't even think exist). The act of him leaving the house was to get them separated so the audience would have another location/setting to look at.- The baddies take time to make spooky noises, play records of dull music, and write words repeatedly on windows without being noticed. Maybe they were having flashbacks of being bad in school where they had to write the same word over and over.- In the extra-feature on the DVD, someone's talking about how he agrees with what he heard from others: that it's not a horror movie but a terror movie. I disagree with that. This is not horror and there was nothing terrifying here either.- This is a perfect example of a movie where sounds ruin the atmosphere. A spooky masked person appears out of the shadows and you're presented with a quick bunch of notes/lil' bit of music indicating something happened that you should be scared of. Just like canned laughter in a sitcom, which assumes that the audience doesn't know when to laugh, a similar method is used here and it fails. It needed to be quieter in order to gain some sense of terror. The movies ""High Tension"" and ""Funny Games"" got that part right.- Perhaps the worst scene is when the dude's in the car and bending down to get something. Oooh....a human hand appears and a finger touches him on the neck. He quickly freaks and turns around to see that there's isn't anybody. Quickly getting out of the vehicle, he encounters nobody. So in a split-second, the actual person ran away and hid? Or is this to represent how fear caused him to imagine something that didn't really happen? Regardless, it's anothercliche and unoriginal.Another scene equally annoying: the couple is in the car after they managed to grow brains and decided late-in-the-game that it just might be a good idea to leave. A truck pulls up behind them -- but not too close. The almost-husband driver sees a masked woman -- who was originally ON the property -- is in the vehicle (I guess she ran off to get it so they could use it to smash the other car). Looking ahead, the couple see the masked man in front of the car. Rather than try and run him over or merely drive away, genius-man brilliantly suggests to the wife that they ""Get out of the car."" I changed my mind: that is definitely the worst scene and one that should make everyone say ""What in the world are you doing??"".That truck, by the way, is apparently the same one that we see the three baddies in at the end of the flick. At that time, we see that it miraculously wasn't damaged at all even though they rammed the couple's car with it earlier. ""It will be easier next time,"" are the final words of one of the women baddies as papa (?) drives away. Seriously, therewas nothing hard for any of them. They were spending time making records play, writing messages, sneaking up with an axe and stopping and disappearing for no reason, banging on doors and making other noises,etc. A lot of what was done was just to get the audience to think ""Uhoh...this is it!"" and then it was over. None of the strangers got hurt and they made it hard for themselves by taking a long time to do their terrible deeds. I can picture one of the baddies thinkin' ""Sure, I could hurt them now, but first I need to change the record."" There was nothing of resistance they encountered and the couple could have just been offed right at the start. Maybe it wasn't easy in their minds because they were mechanics (or ""MacGyver"" wannabes) and it took time to fix the banged-up truck and make it all pretty before they left?- The only potentially-good idea the couple had was when they were in the closet and decided to just shoot whoever came in. Yet after they accidentally kill a friend that showed up, stupidity returns andthey decide it's best to leave the closet. I think they could have still remained and made sure that it was a masked person first before shooting. Then again, maybe the strangers would have also grown a brain by then and realized that the targets have a weapon and not gone in.- So, at one point, something was blocking the smoke from getting out of a fireplace's chimney. In time, the house should have filled with smoke. I guess the blockage eventually fixed itself. Maybe what happened was one of the strangers climbed up to the roof, blocked the chimney so that an alarm would go off and spook the woman, removed the blockage, climbed down from the roof, and eventually snuck into the house and turned over the detector to scare her even more. What amazing planning! The strangersmust also be psychics to know that the woman was going to drop the smoke detector.- This was compared to ""Funny Games"", which also had no real plot and only dealt with a dangerous pair of 20-somethings who had nothing better to do than travel around playing mind-games with unsuspecting people and killing them in the end. It was a much more interesting movie with some 'terror' moments and wasn't filled with continual stupidity like this one.- ""Why are you doing this?"" the woman/almost-wife asked. ""Because you were home,"" one of the masked women-strangers says. In a non-brilliant move, the trailer for the movie ends with this which ruins the 'twist'.- The strangers' time writing on windows and just appearing and disappearing over and over made me think that they weren't human or this was some person's traumatic memories/creation. The movie seemed to want the audience to think that something supernatural was going on when there really wasn't. It felt like it couldn't make up its mind and, in the end, they were just basic serial killers.In conclusion, this was totally forgettable and I slept very well that night. It's a bad movie where the barely-terrorized couple had a shotgun with a lot of shells and a working car that none of the three strangers had enough sense to damage so the couple could easily escape. The movie was filled with stupid cliches and dumb actions or inaction.It's was a bit sad when I viewed an old review on YouTube which had a guy talking about how fantastic the flick is and that he was going to pay to see it again and get the DVD. Of course he can have hisopinion, but I was thinking ""Dude, don't pay any movie theatre their exorbitant price twice! Just wait a few months for the DVD.""Out of all of my reviews, this is the first movie one that I given one star to. According to the rating system here at Amazon, one star means 'I hate it'. Even with other movies I disliked, I was always able to find something semi-worthwhile and gave two stars ('I don't like it')...but I couldn't seem to do that with this one which had nothing I even semi-liked.Dear reader, it's okay to go ahead and be a stranger to this movie. It's not worth any visitors and I'm glad I wasted no money on it since I borrowed it from the library.",1,spoilers for a plot-less movie & thoughts for a flick without any,1390003200,"01 18,

Masked psychos terrorize a couple late one night in a large house nestled in the corner of a small, rich suburb.  A bit slow to start and the characters aren't anything close to interesting, but the setup is decent and the atmosphere is good.Problem?  Everyone's a moron.If you're a home intruder and the people at home have a gun, you're not going to keep attacking.  No you're going to run the **** away and go to some other house some other night.  If you're the guy being intruded upon and are sitting in the corner one night with a gun you're not going to go outside and play Elmer Fudd.  No, you're going to sit in that corner and stay awake until morning when the suburb will be active.  If you're the intruder watching the guy play Elmer Fudd with a shotgun you're not going to bull-rush him and succeed.  No, you're going to be blown the **** away.  And if you're some guy who just had his windshield smashed before your eyes and sees signs of an obvious break-in you're not going to quietly sneak inside to investigate.  No, you're going to drive away and call the cops.The suspension of disbelief is just too much in this film.  It's a battle of who wants to be killed more and who's more inept at taking an advantage.

1178767,A2O9ZGE4NN9XP1,B001D2WU8O,"Haze Blackmon ""NinjaMagicianRollinOnDubs""","[9, 17]","Was this movie intended to be a joke? Because not only are the events in the movie highly implausable, but quite laughable. At the very beginning of the movie the producers of the film decide to share with us that the brutal events on the night of Feburary some date or another of 2005 are not fully known. Brutal? Are you kidding me? The only thing brutal was having to watch this. If their referring to 3 masked strangers running around playing kid games and then finally knifing the protagonists in the end brutal then they need to raise their film making standards.Problems I had with this film and why it is utterly stupid:1.Towards the beginning of the movie the male protagonist(Scott Speedman) leaves in his car to run an errand(returns shortly) and one of the strangers repeatedly knocks, while he is gone, on the front door while the female protagonist(Liv Tyler) is still in house. The strangers also make strange noises outside, which I'm assuming they were screeching the windows(more annoying than anything). The big problem here is, which makes it highly unbelievable, is that Tyler's character doesn't call the police. Yes, the strangers cut the phone lines and her cell phone was dead, as well, but all she would have had to do was plug her cell phone in like she did, get on the horn and get the police out there. Instead she decides to call the boyfriend on the home phone(this is when the land line goes down) and say she's scared please come home. Every cell phone I've ever used can be used if it's dead by plugging it into the charger. The whole thing could of been avoided if she would have either gotten on either phone before she called her boyfriend or her cell phone after the land line was cut. Totally implausible because any senseless person knows that if people are screwing around outside your house to call the cops.2.When the boyfriend arrives back home we find that even though he's a male and looks like he grew up out in the country/middle of nowhere he says he doesn't know how to use a shotgun. I don't know of any guys that can't use a shotgun. Even a pump. Slide shells in, pump, pull trigger, BANG! Not rocket science! But it seems are brave gentleman boyfriend learns how to use the shotgun rather quickly by blowing off his friend's head(this friend just showed up outside in his vehicle for whatever reason at the time Liv and Scott are hiding in a room in the house). Why is blowing his friend's head off stupid? It's a two-fold deal. First, when this friend arrives and notices things are not as they should be and he goes inside the house to investigate and there is music playing on a record player that is kind of loud, which he fails to turn off, he doesn't call out to Liv and Scott to notify them of his presence. This alone would have saved him from getting shot and is just plain ridiculous because a person's natural reaction in a strange place would be to call out. Secondly, what makes it the most ridiculous and unbelievable is when Scott and Liv are hiding in the room waiting for one of the strangers to come in the room and have the shotgun pointed at the door opening the idiot Scott fires blindly as his friend walks by the door and kills him. This is the most absolutely stupid thing I have ever seen in a film. No one would be so stupid to fire blindly until they've at least seen who it is. These strangers are all wearing masks. All Scotto had to do was notice whether the person was wearing a mask or not. Would have a taken a split second to deduce that. Instead, let's close are eyes and fire blindly because we're complete idiots. Totally implausable and you can see this little event coming from a mile away.3.Backing up a bit. When the boyfriend returns to the house and decides trouble is afoot he realizes he left his cell phone out in the car. Duhhhhhh! Ok, so you say not a big problem there. Well, he goes out to get it and it's not their and trouble ensues. Now, the problem here is the same as problem 1 above because once he gets back in the house to safety he notices his cell phone is lying on a shelf/ledge(something like that, i forget) and one of the strangers has put it there to let him/them know they've been in the house. Use the freakin' phone to call the police already! Nope! They do problem 1 above, again, instead.4.After shooting his friend, Scotty decides to go outside and hide in waiting with the shotgun and leave his girlie Liv in the house all by her lonesome self, which leaving her by herself is completely stupid in and of itself. What makes it even more stupid is him going outside, even with a shotgun, against an unknown number of assailants/strangers and gets captured and gets the gun taken away.5.Then Liv worried about Scotty decides to charge blindly out in the dark and sprains her ankle in a ditch/gully and thus the strangers play stupid, childish games with her and Scotty for the remaining 20 or so minutes of this pointless movie. Finally the agony for the viewer ends after Liv and Scotty are tied up, stabbed, and later 2 Christian boys on bikes discover them and apparently/possibly Liv survived, though, we are given no real ending as to whether she did survive or whether the strangers where caught even though this is movie is based on actual events and all. Aren't some movies just wonderful?!If this is the best material they can come up with for a movie then they just need to hang it up, NOW! I was expecting a suspenseful, tension filled Halloween movie to watch with my wife. Instead I got a highly implausable laugh fest that reeks of sheer stupidity. Brutal? No. Scary? No. Suspenseful? No. A Joke? Yes! An Insult? Yes! A Waste Of Time & Money? Yes! For the love of all things holy do not buy this movie, do not rent this movie, do not borrow or let anyone lend you this movie such as a friend(if one your friends owns this piece of junk disown them! LOL), if you see it in passing at the video store and can't find anything else to rent ignore it with all your will power because if you give in you will be highly sorry you ever watched it and you will feel the pain. Terrible Pain!!!!!! I still don't know how I made it through the 1 hour 20 minutes of this pain fest!Thank goodness I only wasted a couple of bucks renting this joke of a movie. I really would have been in pain had I bought it. The director, producer and writer(s) of this stinkfest should be ashamed themselves and should have their appropriate film making/writing licenses yanked and should not be allowed to work in the movie industry again!THE WORST & STUPIDEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN, EVER & I'VE SEEN A LOT OF DOOZIES!",1,THE STUPIDEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,6621,"['Was', 'movie', 'intended',

The ending, however polarizing, is truthful to what comes before it and earns its place in the film.Having said that, I recommend that before seeing this movie, you watch the 2006 French film Them (Ils) on which it was based.  No, that's not right.  Let me try again.  I recommend that before seeing this movie, you watch the 2006 French film Them (Ils) that The Stangers writer-director Bryan Bertino flat-out ripped off.  Now that I think about it, ""ripped off"" might be too kind a term.  It insinuates that Bertino simply stole the *idea* of the movie instead of lifting scenes directly from it and planting them in his own movie.  It's basic, good old-fashioned plagiarism at work here, and I think Bertino should be a little bit ashamed of himself for thinking that no one would ever notice that he copied an infinitely superior and little-seen French film.As a punctuation point, when asked during an interview if The Strangers was influenced by an ""original movie or other films,"" Bertino carefully replied: ""I don't necessarily think that I looked at it.""  The title to which the interviewer was referring is not mentioned, but I'm pretty sure it was Them.  The similarities are too many to be coincidental, and Bryan Bertino's response is more than vague; it's downright evasive.You will find the interview here: [...]",3,Not So Original...,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,1416,"['enjoyed', 'Strangers', 'really', 'did', 'setup', 'simple', 'execution', 'frightening', 'ending', 'however', 'polarizing', 'truthful', 'what', 'place', 'film.Having', 'said', 'recommend', 'before', 'seeing', 'movie', 'watch', '2006', 'French', 'film', 'Them', 'Ils', 'was', 'based', 'No', 'not', 'right', 'Let', 'try', 'again', 'recommend', 'before', 'seeing', 'movie', 'watch', '2006', 'French', 'film', 'Them', 'Ils', 'Stangers', 'writer-director', 'Bryan', 'Bertino', 'flat-out', 'ripped', 'off', 'Now', 'think', 'ripped', 'off', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'kind', 'term', 'Bertino', 'simply', 'stole', '*idea*', 'movie', 'instead', 'lifting', 'scenes', 'directly', 'planting', 'own', 'movie', 'basic', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'plagiarism', 'work', 'here', 'think', 'Bertino', 'should', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'ashamed', 'thinking', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'notice', 'copied', 'infinitely', 'superior', 'little-seen', 'French', 'film.As', 'punctuation', 'point', 'when', 'asked', 'interview', 'Strangers', 'was', 'influenced', 'original', 'movie', 'other', 'films', 'Bertino', 'carefully', 'replied', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'think', 'looked', 'title', 'interviewer', 'was', 'referring', 'not', 'mentioned', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', 'Them', 'similarities', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'be', 'coincidental', 'Bryan', 'Bertino', 'response', 'more', 'vague', 'downright', 'evasive.You', 'will', 'find', 'interview', 'here', '[', ']']",N/A

Hoyos,"[0, 1]","****** No Plot Spoilers *******Initially, when I saw ""The Strangers"" in the video store, I refused to buy it because of the cover depicting a hooded man dragging someone across the floor by their legs.  I thought it was another one of those gory, mundane torture porn films.  My friend Beth loaned it to me.  I was simply amazed by the message that it taught me.  The plot was simple; a young couple spending the night in a house in the country is terrorized by masked strangers.  However, the plot was also terrifying.  A year later, I can't forget the film's message.  I probably never will.Bryan Bertino's ""The Strangers"" is realistic in that innocent people are attacked all the time in this country by amoral strangers who are simply looking for a thrill.  The film merely sheds some light on this growing epidemic.  It reminded me that I should never open the door to a stranger at night or during the day for that matter.  (If you pay me a visit, you better call me beforehand.)  If a stranger comes to my door more than once, I'm calling 911.  I will always remember to keep my iPhone charged.  I don't want to make myself a prisoner in my own home but it is better to be cautious than dead.The film's leads (Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman) deliver excellent performances as the young, beautiful couple who are terrorized without mercy.  There is much chemistry between them, making the scenes more believable.  Because I liked the characters, I feared for their safety and experienced a tremendous amount of tension and stress whenever events didn't bode well for them.  ""The Strangers"" is not a high body count thriller with a lot of torture scenes and gore.  It is a cautionary tale that warns us that there are evil, demented strangers who enjoy preying on innocent people.""The Strangers"" is highly recommended for fans who enjoy realistic horror.  Since watching it, I've had two incidents of strangers ringing my doorbell late at night.  I never answered; I just let them ring it until they finally left.  Mom, who was visiting me during the last incident, looked out of the second story window and saw a young girl walk away from the front door and join a guy who'd been standing under a nearby tree.  They may have mistaken my apartment for one belonging to a drug dealer.  Everyone, I believe, should watch ""The Strangers.""  Even if it doesn't scare you, it may save your life.Joseph B.

1178775,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B001D2WU8O,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[1, 5]","Terror abounds in this frightening thriller about two young lovers being stalked by three mask-wearing killers.James (Scott Speedman) and Kristen (Liv Tyler) are on their way to a summer retreat house. The house is completely decked out with rose petals, candles, and champagne.  It was supposed to be a happy occasion for the couple, but Kristen unexpectedly turned down James' marriage proposal.  Now, the couple is shut up inside the house with virtually nothing to do.  Kristen discovered she had run out of cigarettes and she asked James to go out for more.  But, when James leaves, the terror begins for Kristen.  Soon, she is hearing strange noises and loud knocking at the front door.The events continue to get more and more scary until the masked intruders have made their way inside the house.  Ultimately, Chris and Kristen are abducted and tied up by the intruders, leaving Kristen to say ""why us?""  The abductors' simple reply is chilling: ""because you're home"".This is a very scary movie.  Yes, the movie has it's share of blood, but this movie also goes back to a time when horror movies relied on psychological terror to scare viewers.  This movie does a very good job of using psychological terror.  There are several scenes where the strangers are lurking in the shadows, just out of view of James and Kristen.I enjoyed this movie very much, and I recommend it highly.

1178776,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B001D2WU8O,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[0, 1]","This is a good little chiller--despite giant holes in the plot and a heroine who is so helpless and fragile that she should be in a nursing home. The story is a classic setting for fear and mayhem: an isolated house out in the woods where a couple is terrorized by mysterious forces.The first time you hear the sudden knocking on the door, you experience a sense of dread. Not many people have a visitor knocking on their door at 3 or 4 in the morning. When the visitor turns out to be a total stranger, asking a strange question, the suspense mounts. But what does Scott Speedman, the husband, do? He moseys out to his car for a drive, or is it to buy some cigarettes. Anyway, his gentle, child-like bride, liv Tyler is left alone and another visitor knocks on the door. Throughout this movie, the actress portrays a woman who is so pathetically a ""Daddy's Girl,"" that she can't function on her own. She cringes and cowers and when she gets her husband on the phone, she doesn't sound very scared. She just tells him to hurry home. Does she check the windows and doors to see if they're locked? Does she gather around her an arsenal of possible weapons to use--like knives, screw drivers, heavy plates, pots, etc. She does none of these things.She just sits and nervously waits for her man to come back to protect her. When the violence escalates, she retreats even more into child-like behavior, not even bothering to help out her poor husband who is being beaten up and tortured. She just screams and wails and hides out.  One scene is unbelievably illogical: her husband has made his way to the garage while the killers are all around. And what does his wife do? She just sits on the backsteps of the house, her head resting on her knees, exposed to the killers. When she does FINALLY grab a knife for defense, it's the smallest one in her kitchen. I would have found the biggest one to protect myself. And when a buddy of her husband finally comes to visit them, the couple have barricaded themselves in a room. The buddy doesn't even say anything, like, ""Hey, anybody around?"" He just walks into the darkened house with destroyed furniture everywhere and something really bad happens to him. The wife has another chance to shriek and gibber and wail, alerting the killers to their hideout.Despite these weaknesses, this movie proves that you can still make an effective thriller on a low budget without l00 million dollars worth of special effects or paying some actor $25 million to show his face for the camera. If they could have made the wife figure a feisty, realistic woman of 2008, this flick could have been even better. Maybe in the sequel that's being planned, we'll have a female who knows when it's time to fight back and stop looking for her ""man"" to protect her.",3,Don't Answer the Door at 4 A.M.,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,2782,"['good', 'little', 'chiller', 'giant', 'holes', 'plot', 'heroine', 'who', 'so', 'helpless', 'fragile', 'should', 'be', 'nursing', 'home', 'story', 'classic', 'setting', 'fear', 'mayhem', 'isolated', 'house', 'woods', 'where', 'couple', 'terrorized', 'mysterious', 'forces.The', 'first', 'time', 'hear', 'sudden', 'knocking', 'door', 'experience', 'sense', 'dread', 'Not', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'visitor', 'knocking', 'door', '3', '4', 'morning', 'When', 'visitor', 'out', 'be', 'total', 'stranger', 'asking', 'strange', 'question', 'suspense', 'mounts', 'what', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'husband', 'do', 'out', 'car', 'drive', 'buy', 'cigarettes', 'Anyway', 'gentle', 'child-like', 'bride', 'liv', 'Tyler', 'left', 'alone', 'visitor', 'door', 'movie', 'actress', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'pathetically', 'Daddy', 'Girl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'function', 'own', 'cowers', 'when', 'husband', 'phone', ""n't"", 'sound', 'very', 'scared', 'just', 'hurry', 'home', 'check', 'windows', 'doors', 'see', ""'re"", 'locked', 'Does', 'gather', 'arsenal', 'possible', 'weapons', 'use', 'knives', 'screw', 'drivers', 'heavy', 'plates', 'pots', 'etc', 'none', 'things.She', 'just', 'sits', 'nervously', 'waits', 'man', 'come', 'back', 'protect', 'When', 'violence', 'retreats', 'even', 'more', 'child-like', 'behavior', 'not', 'even', 'bothering', 'help', 'out', 'poor', 'husband', 'who', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'tortured', 'just', 'screams', 'wails', 'out', 'One', 'scene', 'unbelievably', 'illogical', 'husband', 'made', 'way', 'garage', 'killers', 'are', 'what', 'wife', 'do', 'just', 'sits', 'backsteps', 'house', 'head', 'resting', 'knees', 'exposed', 'killers', 'When', 'FINALLY', 'grab', 'knife', 'defense', 'smallest', 'one', 'kitchen', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'biggest', 'one', 'protect', 'when', 'buddy', 'husband', 'finally', 'visit', 'couple', 'have', 'barricaded', 'room', 'buddy', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'anything', 'Hey', 'anybody', 'around', 'just', 'walks', 'darkened', 'house', 'destroyed', 'furniture', 'everywhere', 'something', 'really', 'bad', 'happens', 'wife', 'chance', 'shriek', 'gibber', 'wail', 'alerting', 'killers', 'hideout.Despite', 'weaknesses', 'movie', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'effective', 'thriller', 'low', 'budget', 'l00', 'million', 'dollars', 'worth', 'special', 'effects', 'paying', 'actor', '25', 'million', 'show', 'face', 'camera', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'wife', 'figure', 'feisty', 'realistic', 'woman', '2008', 'flick', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'Maybe', 'sequel', 'being', 'planned', ""'ll"", 'have', 'female', 'who', 'when', 'time', 'fight', 'back', 'stop', 'looking', 'man', 'protect']",N/A

I'm usually a big fan of slow-burners (like the Pact and Absentia) but this one isn't very effective. It starts off very slow, without any scares and limited dialogue and it starts to pick up after the 25 minute mark; considering the movie is about 1hr 20min without credits, I found that to be a bad thing. When it gets started, it's still slow but we do get some very intense scenes and creepy imagery, like the masked man watching from the background. But, most of the intense scenes last too long and the tension begins to fall the more you see the same scene; the tension/build up lasts so long, by the time the scare or creepy imagery occurs, you're no longer scared or paying attention. The loud noise scares were very predictable, but somewhat fun. And, as for the dialogue, I felt like they were whispering most of the time. Also, the pacing was terrible, even with its short runtime, I felt like this movie could've been cut to a shorter runtime and still be equally effective.

Turns out they are as three strangers have decided to target James and Kristen for reasons that are pretty simple, ""Cause you were home"" as the girl says later in the film (and was also in the trailer, for those who remember it).What makes this movie scary is there isn't a whole lot of people in the cast, beyond the strangers, the couple there's maybe four other bit players, so the focus is really put on the strangers and how they simply are out to cause havoc on the couple. One of the best sequences was when a friend of James comes into the cabin and well meets an untimely end shall we say, but the tension keeps mounting even though most horror fans know whats coming way before it does.I don't often get scared watching horror movies but this was one that got to me, probably cause while its of course just a movie, that this whole situation could actually happen.

It reminded me of some of my favorite horror books, people being lost or cut of from civilization with something evil on their trail. Well this movie was awesome, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the creep factor was high, a cozy home has never looked as ominous and unfriendly as this one.When a couple on the verge of a happy moment ( en engagement)  suddenly hits a rough patch because the girl doesn't want the ring, they leave the dinner party and head back to on old family house; set up with rose petals and awaiting them with privacy and what was supposed to be a romantic night. Alone in middle of nowhere they try to settle in for the night, their awkwardness visible as James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) tires to lessen his embarrassment from the rejection without cutting out Kristen McKay (Liv Tyler) from his life forever. Depressed and confused up they manage to hug and kiss, when loud knock rattles the door. Seeing that it's 4 am, they make their way to the door with apprehension and open it to see a girl, standing in the shadows, asking for someone who doesn't live there. They eventually get her to leave, but more knocking and strange noises are soon to follow.  Out of cigarettes, bad habit in life but worse in horror movies, James volunteers to pick some up for Kristen, leaving her alone in the house. Obviously this is when the scary stuff picks up and she is terrorized and eagerly awaiting his return. He comes back but safety is nowhere in reach, together they try to figure out why someone is knocking on the door and banging on the windows, wearing masks and holding weapons. Pretty soon it's apparent that the three strangers are well organized and they want to do more than scare from people, they are out for blood, for no reason other than they fact that they can do it.I loved the eerie atmosphere and the dark shadows surrounding the small home, with nowhere to hide and with three clever attackers close behind in pursuit.  The couple was driven mad with confusion as to why this was happening and with hope of surviving till dawn, some part of the movie were peaceful, making me feel like all the bad stuff was in my imagination and then the madness would return and paint a grim picture for out couple. This reminded me of ""Vacancy"" which was another fun horror movie; because when people think they are safe indoors it turns out that they are not safe, instead they are trapped, waiting for the predator to strike.This is a great movie to watch in the dark, for those who dare of course. The TV looks great blending into the shadows and the movie is thrilling and entertaining and even little strange, but all for its benefit.- Kasia S.",4,Lock the door and pretend you're not home...,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,2738,"[""'ve"", 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'ever', 'trailer', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'reminded', 'favorite', 'horror', 'books', 'people', 'being', 'lost', 'cut', 'civilization', 'something', 'evil', 'trail', 'Well', 'movie', 'was', 'awesome', 'enjoyed', 'atmosphere', 'creep', 'factor', 'was', 'high', 'cozy', 'home', 'never', 'looked', 'ominous', 'unfriendly', 'couple', 'verge', 'happy', 'moment', 'en', 'engagement', 'suddenly', 'rough', 'patch', 'girl', ""n't"", 'want', 'ring', 'leave', 'dinner', 'party', 'head', 'back', 'old', 'family', 'house', 'set', 'up', 'rose', 'petals', 'awaiting', 'privacy', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'romantic', 'night', 'Alone', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'try', 'settle', 'night', 'awkwardness', 'visible', 'James', 'Hoyt', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'lessen', 'embarrassment', 'rejection', 'cutting', 'out', 'Kristen', 'McKay', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'life', 'forever', 'Depressed', 'confused', 'up', 'manage', 'hug', 'kiss', 'when', 'loud', 'knock', 'door', 'Seeing', '4', 'am', 'make', 'way', 'door', 'apprehension', 'open', 'see', 'girl', 'standing', 'shadows', 'asking', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'live', 'there', 'eventually', 'get', 'leave', 'more', 'knocking', 'strange', 'noises', 'are', 'soon', 'follow', 'cigarettes', 'bad', 'habit', 'life', 'worse', 'horror', 'movies', 'James', 'volunteers', 'pick', 'up', 'Kristen', 'leaving', 'alone', 'house', 'Obviously', 'when', 'scary', 'stuff', 'up', 'terrorized', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'return', 'back', 'safety', 'nowhere', 'reach', 'together', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'someone', 'knocking', 'door', 'banging', 'windows', 'wearing', 'masks', 'holding', 'weapons', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'apparent', 'three', 'strangers', 'are', 'well', 'organized', 'want', 'do', 'more', 'scare', 'people', 'are', 'out', 'blood', 'reason', 'other', 'fact', 'can', 'do', 'it.I', 'loved', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'dark', 'surrounding', 'small', 'home', 'nowhere', 'hide', 'three', 'clever', 'attackers', 'close', 'pursuit', 'couple', 'was', 'driven', 'mad', 'confusion', 'why', 'was', 'happening', 'hope', 'surviving', 'till', 'dawn', 'part', 'movie', 'were', 'peaceful', 'making', 'feel', 'bad', 'stuff', 'was', 'imagination', 'then', 'madness', 'would', 'return', 'paint', 'grim', 'picture', 'out', 'couple', 'reminded', 'Vacancy', 'was', 'fun', 'horror', 'movie', 'when', 'people', 'think', 'are', 'safe', 'indoors', 'out', 'are', 'not', 'safe', 'instead', 'are', 'trapped', 'waiting', 'predator', 'strike.This', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'dark', 'who', 'dare', 'course', 'TV', 'great', 'blending', 'shadows', 'movie', 'thrilling', 'entertaining', 'even', 'little', 'strange', 'benefit.-', 'Kasia', 'S']",N/A

I've seen some reviews on here that tear this movie to shreds, but I don't see any reason for that. Do the characters always make smart choices? No. I would say they do some pretty dumb things.SPOILER ALERT!For example, why does the woman stay in the house knowing there is somebody in there with her??)SPOILER OVER!!But let's be honest, even real people don't make smart choices. And quite often, it is the dumb choices that people make that give many horror movies their suspense. And given the circumstances that are occurring, I think most people could be forgiven for making some irrational decisions.Did it have a great ending? No, it wasn't ""Halloween"" or ""Planet of the Apes""-great, but it was harmless. But I don't feel the ending completely sucked, either, like some other films (Cloverfield comes to mind.)Was it slow? Yes, it was a little. But that is what builds SUSPENSE, people. Try watching The Exorcist again sometime and you'll realize (if you haven't already) that NOTHING remotely interesting or scary happens for the first hour and 15 minutes. But because you know what is coming, you force yourself to endure it. Which builds the suspense. And this movie isn't nearly as slow as The Exorcist (not comparing quality here, just pacing.)What I loved about the movie was its realistic feel. It felt like actual people who are going through relatable issues in their life who are forced to deal with an out of the ordinary, but not entirely implausible situation. The fact that they make unwise decisions is REAL because in real life, nobody is prepared to deal with a situation like this (no matter how many horror movies you watch.)This movie doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is.

In fact, the climax of the film will leave even the most tolerant viewer with severe nauseousness (and for good reason, its a terrible, terrible story). While 2008's ""Funny Games"" was easily one of the most ""intruders slaughtering innocent homedwellers"" sorts of movie, this takes it up another level, only because everything that happens here is plausible, and for that reason alone, bonechilling.Much has been made of Liv Tylers' performance, and the hype is right. She is beautifully cast and performs her role with great dignity, although some may wonder how hiding in a closet could be termed 'acting'. Unbeknowest to most, this film also marks the debut of supermodel Gemma Ward (in the roll of 'Dollface') but we never really get to see her face throughout. ""The Strangers"" may have no motive or real direction except to 'finish off' the young couple, but the movies' brilliance is in how it prolongs their agony and make things worse. This is not a pretty picture, things seem only 'all too real', and you may not be able to watch certain segments.Even for die-hard horror film buffs, films like ""The Strangers"" might be too much to digest.

It's a simple story about home invasion as a trio of masked killers visit the summer house of James and Kristen; a couple romantically involved but very much unmarried. It's almost morning but still dark out. If there are neighbors within screaming range, they're probably sound asleep. So it's a terrific setting for a horror movie. The horror begins interestingly enough, but it stalls itself all the way to the end. The killers seem to realize they're in a horror movie, in other words, so they play around with their victims, appearing then disappearing suddenly, sometimes magically, in what seems like a collaborative effort to stall time.

Claiming to be `inspired by true events', it's not difficult to believe. The story is a rehash of possibly every slasher film from the seventies. The real star here is the sound effects. The viewer is initially spooked by loud knockings on doors and other things that `go bump in the night'. After ten minutes, it becomes wearisome and nearly the entire film is a series of sound effects to fill in the voids. This is particularly annoying if you have surround sound.The plot is remarkably static and contrived. A portly man and two women wearing masks besiege the couple throughout the night. They appear and disappear, seeming to just enjoy terrorizing the couple. But this couple does all the typical `do not go there' and `do not do that' stuff you've seen before. Why would the guy leave his girlfriend alone in the house to get cigarettes with this going on? Why would the gal leave the house and run in the dark to the barn to try and make a call? How could the guy claim to not know how to work a shotgun and then make a pinpoint perfect hit? Thankfully, director Bryan Bertino keeps the gore to a minimum until the end.

From repetitive torture films, dreadfull remakes, and cliched endings, its very, very rare to find a good horror movie these days. But every once in awhile, we are treated to a very good scary movie that rises aboves the genres bad reputation and delivers the thrills and chills. The Strangers is one of those movies.The premise of the film is extremly simple. A young couple find themselves being terrorized by three masked strangers one night and both must fight for survival in order to make it out alive. That's all I'm going to give away, so as to not spoil the movie experience.There are a few reasons on why the film works. First, as stated before, the premise is simple, with no back story, huge sets, glossy effects,  over the top gore effects, none of that. Instead what the film employs are simple sets, dark atmosphere, creepy music, and killers that are not given a background but just there to terrorize.The director Bryan Bertino uses all these elements to create nerve jolting scenes that keep your heart pumping, eyes glued to the screen, and jumping with fright. From a simple act of rusty chains, creaking doors, shifting shadows, crackle of leaves, you already get this feeling of unease, as if you are not sure what is going to happen or what may come next. Every corner you see, every window you look out, it gives you this sense-of-dread feeling that gives The Strangers its power.So turn off the lights, pop some popcorn, and settle in for one hell of a scary ride.",5,One of the Best Scary Movies in a Long Time,1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,1583,"['say', 'horror', 'days', 'dire', 'situation', 'bit', 'understatement', 'repetitive', 'torture', 'films', 'dreadfull', 'remakes', 'cliched', 'endings', 'very', 'very', 'rare', 'find', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'days', 'once', 'awhile', 'are', 'treated', 'very', 'good', 'scary', 'movie', 'genres', 'bad', 'reputation', 'thrills', 'chills', 'Strangers', 'one', 'movies.The', 'premise', 'film', 'extremly', 'simple', 'young', 'couple', 'find', 'being', 'terrorized', 'three', 'masked', 'strangers', 'one', 'night', 'must', 'fight', 'survival', 'order', 'make', 'out', 'alive', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'away', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'works', 'First', 'stated', 'premise', 'simple', 'back', 'story', 'huge', 'sets', 'glossy', 'effects', 'top', 'gore', 'effects', 'none', 'Instead', 'what', 'film', 'employs', 'are', 'simple', 'sets', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'creepy', 'music', 'killers', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'background', 'just', 'there', 'terrorize.The', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Bertino', 'elements', 'create', 'nerve', 'jolting', 'scenes', 'keep', 'heart', 'pumping', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'jumping', 'fright', 'simple', 'act', 'rusty', 'chains', 'creaking', 'doors', 'shifting', 'shadows', 'crackle', 'leaves', 'already', 'get', 'feeling', 'unease', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'what', 'may', 'come', 'next', 'Every', 'corner', 'see', 'window', 'look', 'out', 'sense-of-dread', 'feeling', 'Strangers', 'power.So', 'turn', 'off', 'lights', 'pop', 'popcorn', 'settle', 'one', 'hell', 'scary', 'ride']",N/A

1178825,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B001D2WU8O,Michael R Gates,"[8, 11]","There is a scene in John McNaughton's HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER (1986) in which Henry (Michael Rooker) and his friend Otis (Tom Towles) invade the home of perfect strangers and torture, rape, and kill the occupants.  When I first started seeing trailers for Bryan Bertino's THE STRANGERS, I got a strong feeling that the film was going to be little more than a feature-length re-do of that scene from McNaughton's film, only it would be padded out, I feared, with lots of the elements of the so-called torture-porn that is en vogue in contemporary horror cinema.  How wonderfully wrong I was.Instead of another ho-hum, leave-nothing-to-the-imagination torture-porn horror flick, THE STRANGERS is a truly terrifying film that hearkens back to the pre-1980s era of the slasher sub-genre.  As it follows a young couple on their return from the wedding of a friend, the film starts out sort of leisurely and ordinary, not even hinting at the horrors to come.  The terror comes on slowly, starting with a late-night knock on the door, then escalates through home invasion, vandalism, violence, and murder.  However, unlike the relentless graphic bloodletting common to most of today's horror films, THE STRANGERS separates the acts of violence with the types of cat-and-mouse chases and boogeyman-at-the-window shots that made slasher films so much fun back in the day.  Not that the film is totally devoid of grue and gore, but the filmmakers avoid the in-your-face viscera that tends to push a lot of recent horror films into the realm of exploitation cinema.  With THE STRANGERS, director Bertino and his crew want to scare you; they don't want to make you lose your lunch.As this film's proverbial final girl, Liv Tyler does an outstanding job donning the mantle of a scream queen.  This part is a far cry from her more-famous role of the stoic Arwen the elf in THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, yet she does a very convincing job here generating various degrees of fear and terror.The DVD from Universal Studios presents THE STRANGERS in both the R-rated theatrical version and a slightly extended Unrated version, and both are in anamorphic widescreen.  The 5.1 Surround-sound English audio is pretty good, although the dialogue seems, at times, to be muffled a bit by the ambient sound.  DVD extras include two deleted scenes and a making-of featurette.Although THE STRANGERS didn't slaughter 'em at the box office, it did garner on opening weekend more than double its production budget.  Not bad for a taut little thriller that has more in common with 1970s slasher flicks like John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN (1978) than it does with contemporaries like HOSTEL (2005) and HOSTEL: PART II (2007).  Which just goes to show that talented filmmakers can still give an audience a good scare without tossing bucket-loads of blood and guts at the camera.  And delivering a good old-fashioned scare is what makes THE STRANGERS a refreshing standout among today's mostly stale horror offerings.",5,THE STRANGERS Hearkens Back to the Roots of the Slasher Sub-Genre,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,2991,"['scene', 'John', 'McNaughton', 'HENRY', 'PORTRAIT', 'A', 'SERIAL', 'KILLER', '1986', 'Henry', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'friend', 'Otis', 'Tom', 'Towles', 'invade', 'home', 'perfect', 'strangers', 'torture', 'rape', 'kill', 'occupants', 'When', 'first', 'started', 'seeing', 'trailers', 'Bryan', 'Bertino', 'THE', 'STRANGERS', 'got', 'strong', 'feeling', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'feature-length', 're-do', 'scene', 'McNaughton', 'film', 'only', 'would', 'be', 'padded', 'out', 'feared', 'lots', 'elements', 'so-called', 'torture-porn', 'en', 'vogue', 'contemporary', 'horror', 'cinema', 'How', 'wonderfully', 'wrong', 'was.Instead', 'ho-hum', 'leave-nothing-to-the-imagination', 'torture-porn', 'horror', 'flick', 'STRANGERS', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'film', 'back', 'pre-1980s', 'era', 'slasher', 'sub-genre', 'young', 'couple', 'return', 'wedding', 'friend', 'film', 'out', 'sort', 'leisurely', 'ordinary', 'not', 'even', 'hinting', 'horrors', 'come', 'terror', 'slowly', 'starting', 'late-night', 'knock', 'door', 'then', 'home', 'invasion', 'vandalism', 'violence', 'murder', 'However', 'relentless', 'graphic', 'bloodletting', 'common', 'most', 'today', 'horror', 'films', 'THE', 'STRANGERS', 'acts', 'violence', 'types', 'cat-and-mouse', 'chases', 'boogeyman-at-the-window', 'shots', 'made', 'slasher', 'films', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'back', 'day', 'Not', 'film', 'totally', 'devoid', 'grue', 'gore', 'filmmakers', 'avoid', 'in-your-face', 'viscera', 'push', 'lot', 'recent', 'horror', 'films', 'realm', 'exploitation', 'cinema', 'STRANGERS', 'director', 'Bertino', 'crew', 'want', 'scare', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'lose', 'lunch.As', 'film', 'proverbial', 'final', 'girl', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'outstanding', 'job', 'donning', 'mantle', 'scream', 'queen', 'part', 'far', 'cry', 'more-famous', 'role', 'stoic', 'Arwen', 'elf', 'THE', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'trilogy', 'yet', 'very', 'convincing', 'job', 'here', 'generating', 'various', 'degrees', 'fear', 'terror.The', 'DVD', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'STRANGERS', 'R-rated', 'theatrical', 'version', 'slightly', 'extended', 'Unrated', 'version', 'are', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', '5.1', 'Surround-sound', 'English', 'audio', 'pretty', 'good', 'dialogue', 'times', 'be', 'muffled', 'bit', 'ambient', 'sound', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making-of', 'THE', 'STRANGERS', 'did', ""n't"", 'slaughter', 'box', 'office', 'did', 'garner', 'opening', 'weekend', 'more', 'double', 'production', 'budget', 'Not', 'bad', 'taut', 'little', 'thriller', 'more', 'common', '1970s', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'HALLOWEEN', '1978', 'contemporaries', 'HOSTEL', '2005', 'PART', 'II', '2007', 'Which', 'just', 'show', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'still', 'give', 'audience', 'good', 'scare', 'tossing', 'bucket-loads', 'blood', 'guts', 'camera', 'delivering', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'scare', 'what', 'STRANGERS', 'refreshing', 'standout', 'today', 'mostly', 'stale', 'horror', 'offerings']",N/A

1178830,A3HOGE326DO4NC,B001D2WU8O,M. Nelson,"[2, 10]","I really wanted to enjoy this film much more than I did. But it was indeed (as another reviewer accurately penned) irritatingly plodding (think less pyschological terror and more a funeral dirge set on continuous loop). I'd never seen the French version before my theater viewing of this (yes, Strangers IS a remake for folks out there claiming how original the concept was), but heard and read great things - the trailer was pretty spooky too. Perhaps something got lost in the translation-vouz...The common criticism of horror movies is the stupidity of its characters and this one has it in spades. By the time dawn actually breaks (which is apparently noon in this part of the country), my moviemate and I were dying - no pun intended - to see Speedman and Tyler FINALLY get finished off. I'm not sure who was being tortured more, them or us.Name a horror cliche and Strangers probably had it...Character heads out into darkness of night with confirmed crazed killer(s) on the prowl? Check. Complete weirdo shows up on doorstep at very unusual hour, yet inhabitants fail to secure the premises? Check (really better to make sure they've gotten inside a time or two before getting around to that). Friend and savior apparent shows up to site of an all-too-obvious tussle, yet sneaks around in silence - stalker style - rather than call out to his buddy from a safe distance and as a result becomes a victim of best friendly fire? Check. I could go on, but then I'd be plodding too.The most disappointing part of this flick though (I have a high tolerance for asinine characters and horror cliches) was the number of details that weren't well thought-out or researched by the director. Surely, I couldn't be the only viewer who noticed the STREET lights in front of the ""under siege"" abode. In virtually any part of the U.S. this would indicate one of two things: either the property was in or very near a municipality or it was adjacent to a major rural intersection or highway. Either way, you're not going to have the seclusion necessary for completely unnoticed and uninterrupted hours of torture, arson and other assorted mayhem. At some point a random motorist (yes, people DO drive in the country - even at night) is likely to notice a blazing Volvo in the drive or a truck stopped on the road and masked lunatics darting to-and-fro. But do we ever see a passing motorist? Not a one... even the hills in the Hills Have Eyes had more traffic.Calling further question as to just how far in the sticks this isolated property was, from where did the Mormon boys arriving just after sunrise come? Utah? On bikes? That doesn't seem like a very efficient method or mode for protheletizing if you ask me.If the nearest population center was indeed miles away, obviously they left their parents' homes in the middle of the night. Silly me for finding that an unlikely scenario.Furthermore, speaking of parental dwellings, I don't ever recall hearing an explanation (or even subtle intimation) why Speedman's parents weren't home or why they weren't expected home at any time that evening or early the following day (admittedly, I might've already been half asleep during this part). Perhaps they were road trippin' to Bonnaroo considering their affinity for vinyl records and folk music... one can only guess.And, regardess of the movie's description, no one will EVER mistake the run-of-the-mill everyday brick ranch-style killing site in the Strangers for a ""vacation home"". Unless there was some lakeshore or mountains behind the machine shed I missed, that's looking a lot like a regular single family home at the edge of suburbia or a small town to me. If his parents only occupied it during their ""vacations"", perhaps there's a good reason Liv shot down his proposal. Maybe he originally suggested eloping to Des Moines and Bertino edited that scene out later? Boringness after all is just as much a heritable trait as it is a learned behavior.In all candor, I hate being overly critical of horror movies. As a huge fan of the zombine sub-genre, I have no problem making giant leaps of faith and overlooking Titanic-sized plot holes. But this movie's claim to terrorize was its supposed realism. Suffice to say, the contextual errors all but destroy the believability of this film.If you're looking for a gut-wrenching (rather than yawn-inducing) flick with psychological terror, [painfully uncomfortable] suspense and randomness that's truly frightening, I'd highly suggest Funny Games (a shot-for-shot remake of Austrian sadism that loses nothing in translation) over this one.

I heard there was supposed to be a sequel made to this movie, but I don't know what ever came of that. I don't hear anything about a sequel for this anymore now.

Based on the premise and early looks at the trailer, it had the look of yet another ""torture porn"" story, of which there are already plenty. Fortunately, 'The Strangers' rises above this and sets out to create something far more subtle, but no less gripping.'The Strangers' is a no-frills suspense film. The premise is pretty basic: Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman play a couple on the rocks, spending the night together in a secluded home. From the beginning, there's a strong sense of isolation and a feeling of sadness that pervades the movie. The uneasiness grows, steadily and unstoppably, as it becomes apparent that they're not the only ones out there...and the strangers that slowly encroach on them do not have good intentions.  Not at all.There's a little backstory here, mostly telling us what's going on between the two main characters, but the main thrust of the story is the growing presence of the strangers. It's done effectively, at first mostly with sound - a knock on the door, a whispered voice, a disturbed wind chime on the back porch. Eventually we see them, often lurking in the background, wearing blank masks of burlap or creepy doll faces. The pace is steady - implacable and insistent and undeniable.The smartest thing about 'The Strangers' is how it balances what is seen and what is unseen. It doesn't rely on gore or ""gotcha"" moments for its scares. Instead, it captures the feeling of isolation and the unknown - the feeling of being alone and afraid of something you can't see - and builds on it effectively. The ending  is shocking and brutal yet not overdone. Like the rest of the film, it leaves much to the imagination of the viewer, where truly the worst can happen.Fear is a powerful force, but truly expressing it in a visual medium (like film) is tough. If too much is explained or too much is shown, what at first seemed fearsome now becomes tame. At some point, you have to trust the viewer to fill in the blanks of what you don't show them. A movie that can do that, and do it well, is the one that truly captures the heart of fear.

Heck, even the previews for the movie were pretty darn creepy!A young couple, Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, arrive at his family country home after a pretty serious disagreement. They've been at wedding, and while at the reception, Speedman proposed...Tyler declined. So they still love each other, but they sure are carrying a big Pink Elephant into the house with them. So these two are already on edge with each other, creating a feeling of dis-ease in the house. Just as their interactions are heating up comes a BIG knocking on their front door.From that moment, they are stalked and terrorized by some very creepy masked figures...seemingly bent on torture and mayhem.That's all I'm telling. Most of the film is this scenario playing out. And as with most films of this kind, the lead characters make many choices that perplex us. My personal favorite is: ""You stay here while I go to this other building...with the only gun we have."" ""No, I want to go with you."" ""Nope, you'll be safer here."" WHAAAT???!!! It makes no sense, yet this splitting up of the heroes is often one of the only ways to help fill what is essentially short story into movie length. So, yes, once again, the people we are meant to sympathize with do a lot of stupid stuff.But we can overlook that in the heat of the film, because frankly, the chills and tension continue to mount. The ""strangers"" are able to move seemingly at will throughout the house and land, knowing and seeing all. The masks certainly make them creepy...but equally scary is their stealth. The movie is shot with a lot of extreme close-ups of the heroes...who are often looking on direction, while in their background, we see a masked figure.The film deliberately avoids using deep focus, and the camera is unsteady (not CLOVERFIELD unsteady...just moving a lot.) There is nothing truly unique in the technical side of the film...but the ""tricks"" of the trade are plied effectively, and I certainly was good and worked up through much of the film.But the ending is so sordid, grim, and STUPID. I'm trying not to spoil anything, but let's just say that the word ""squalid"" came to mind, and that is one thing I don't want from a film. Scare me...GREAT. Gross me out, if you like. But don't devolve into utter pointlessness.When the film ended, and the lights came up, I was angry at the film for taking away the first 90% which I enjoyed and soiling it with a final 10% that was nasty and in which most the characters acted in ways that were not remotely logical. I've seen films fall apart at the end before and given them okay ratings...but this one is such a tremendous insult, that I can't see my way past 2 stars.

1178858,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001D2WU8O,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","The Strangers (Bryan Bertino, 2008)I know it's not a rational thing to consider where The Strangers is concerned, given that the movie was written in the early 2000s (according to IMDB, it was written two years before the release of Ils, to which it is often compared; that would put the writing date at 2003), but I kept thinking to myself that this is basically a remake of Funny Games that was released in the same year as Haneke remade his own movie for an American audience. Yes, there are some surface differences between the movies (and I do mean surface, e.g. the terrorists in this movie wear masks, where Haneke's don't), but the movie gives so many nods to Funny Games that it can't be a coincidence. I should probably give Bertino props for the subtlety of some of those nods (for example, the use of dissonant music that doesn't fit with the rest of the soundtrack; Haneke drops Boredoms into the main title of his 1998 flick, while Bertino tosses in a wonderful bit of Joanna Newsom), but it kept bringing home the similarity underlying the two movies. I can't imagine either Bertino or Haneke knew they would be releasing their two films so closely together, and it's not like this sort of Hollywood anti-magic doesn't happen on a regular basis (think Red Planet and Mission to Mars being released a month or so apart in 2000, for example), but the whole time I was watching this movie, fairly or not, I was comparing it not to Ils, but to the 1998 version of Funny Games. (I haven't seen Haneke's 2008 remake yet.)If you've seen Funny Games, the plot of this flick will be very familiar to you; a couple, James (Underworld's Scott Speedman) and Kristen (The Lord of the Rings' Liv Tyler), are in their remote vacation house when they are terrorized by a band of thugs (supermodel Gemma Ward, Glory Road's Kip Weeks, and Dirty Sexy Money's Laura Margolis). The rules of this game seem simple enough: get out of the house or die.It's not a bad movie, especially the first half; Bertino understands, as few American directors in the Hollywood machine do, that atmosphere and character are two of the key components you need to work with if you're going to scare the living daylights out of your audience. And the first half of this movie does achieve fat stacks of scary, as the terrorists don't actually do anything other than stuff that can still be (kind of) construed as harmless. (This is the major way in which the movie does remind me of Ils; that's one of those movies where I was wondering whether anything was actually going to happen right up until it did.) Once the terrorists ratchet up the terror, however, Bertino himself seems to lose his way, and the movie drives straight into clich&eacute; territory on one too many occasions. In the film's defense, Bertino does know how to take those clich&eacute;s and make them effective in the scope of his film. Yes, every horror movie has that scene with the killer just suddenly appearing in the background without the characters noticing, and the disappearing again, but I haven't seen it done this effectively in a while. And I give Bertino major points for the terrorists' answer to Kristen's repeated ""why are you here?"" imprecation. (If you don't know the answer yet, I won't spoil it for you, but I think it's the worst-kept secret about this movie.) Yes, it's another of the movie's possibly-unconscious nods to Funny Games, but it still hasn't been used enough to not have power.A couple more deviations from the norm and this could have been one of the best horror movies of the decade. As it is, it's still worth checking out, but it's ultimately empty calories, especially if you're an aficionado of this kind of film. ** ",3,"Could have been better, but could have been so much worse.",1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,3706,"['Strangers', 'Bryan', 'Bertino', '2008', 'know', 'not', 'rational', 'thing', 'consider', 'where', 'Strangers', 'concerned', 'given', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'early', '2000s', 'according', 'IMDB', 'was', 'written', 'two', 'years', 'release', 'Ils', 'often', 'compared', 'would', 'put', 'writing', 'date', '2003', 'kept', 'thinking', 'myself', 'basically', 'remake', 'Funny', 'Games', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'Haneke', 'remade', 'own', 'movie', 'American', 'audience', 'Yes', 'are', 'surface', 'differences', 'movies', 'do', 'mean', 'surface', 'e.g', 'terrorists', 'movie', 'wear', 'masks', 'where', 'Haneke', 'do', ""n't"", 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'nods', 'Funny', 'Games', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'coincidence', 'should', 'probably', 'give', 'Bertino', 'props', 'subtlety', 'nods', 'example', 'use', 'dissonant', 'music', ""n't"", 'fit', 'rest', 'soundtrack', 'Haneke', 'Boredoms', 'main', 'title', '1998', 'flick', 'Bertino', 'wonderful', 'bit', 'Joanna', 'Newsom', 'kept', 'bringing', 'home', 'similarity', 'underlying', 'two', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Bertino', 'Haneke', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'releasing', 'two', 'films', 'so', 'closely', 'together', 'not', 'sort', 'Hollywood', 'anti-magic', ""n't"", 'happen', 'regular', 'basis', 'think', 'Red', 'Planet', 'Mission', 'Mars', 'being', 'released', 'month', 'so', 'apart', '2000', 'example', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'fairly', 'not', 'was', 'comparing', 'not', 'Ils', '1998', 'version', 'Funny', 'Games', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Haneke', '2008', 'remake', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Funny', 'Games', 'plot', 'flick', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'familiar', 'couple', 'James', 'Underworld', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'Kristen', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'are', 'remote', 'vacation', 'house', 'when', 'are', 'terrorized', 'band', 'thugs', 'supermodel', 'Gemma', 'Ward', 'Glory', 'Road', 'Kip', 'Weeks', 'Dirty', 'Sexy', 'Money', 'Laura', 'Margolis', 'rules', 'game', 'seem', 'simple', 'enough', 'get', 'house', 'die.It', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'Bertino', 'few', 'American', 'directors', 'Hollywood', 'machine', 'do', 'atmosphere', 'character', 'are', 'two', 'key', 'components', 'need', 'work', ""'re"", 'going', 'scare', 'living', 'daylights', 'audience', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'achieve', 'fat', 'stacks', 'scary', 'terrorists', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'stuff', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'kind', 'construed', 'harmless', 'major', 'way', 'movie', 'remind', 'Ils', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'was', 'wondering', 'anything', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'happen', 'right', 'up', 'did', 'terrorists', 'ratchet', 'up', 'terror', 'however', 'Bertino', 'lose', 'way', 'movie', 'straight', 'clich', 'eacute', 'territory', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'occasions', 'film', 'defense', 'Bertino', 'know', 'how', 'take', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'make', 'effective', 'scope', 'film', 'Yes', 'horror', 'movie', 'scene', 'killer', 'just', 'suddenly', 'appearing', 'background', 'characters', 'noticing', 'disappearing', 'again', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'done', 'effectively', 'while', 'give', 'Bertino', 'major', 'points', 'terrorists', 'answer', 'Kristen', 'repeated', 'why', 'are', 'here', 'imprecation', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'answer', 'yet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'think', 'worst-kept', 'secret', 'movie', 'Yes', 'movie', 'possibly-unconscious', 'nods', 'Funny', 'Games', 'still', ""n't"", 'been', 'used', 'enough', 'not', 'have', 'power.A', 'couple', 'more', 'deviations', 'norm', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', 'decade', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'ultimately', 'empty', 'calories', 'especially', ""'re"", 'aficionado', 'kind', 'film', '**']",N/A

1178862,A21EGMJ3E78LPV,B001D2WU8O,"R. Pepper ""DaysFan79""","[20, 30]","In response to some of the negative reviews: Some reviewers say that people banging on your door in the middle of the night isn't scary? Have they ever been in this type of situation before? I didn't think so. For someone who actually grew up in an isolated home in the woods, I can tell you how nerve wracking it is when you are all alone and you hear strange noises and think someone is out there. Some reviewers remark that the characters do dumb, ridiculous things. First, in horrific and intense situations that almost seem surreal, people aren't always going to make smart choices. You can say if you were in that situation, you would do this or do that. But you don't really know until it actually happens to you. Sometimes we only have a split second to think about what to do instead of sitting down and analyzing the situation. So why is it so hard to think that we wouldn't make the most intelligent choice? That is not what I call unrealistic as others say. Some reviewers have a problem with the ""because you were home,"" bit. Use your head and read between the lines people. These ""strangers"" are obviously unbalanced and what is more unsettling is to think that there are human beings out there (and there are) who get off on terrorizing innocent people just for the fun of it. To me, that is what true terror is. Some reviewers poke fun at the acting. Liv Tyler actually gives one incredible performance. Her emotional scenes were heightened beyond believable and you don't doubt for one second the horror this woman is being subjected to. I guess some audience members prefer seeing Jennifer Love Hewitt in a tighty whitey tank top yelling out ""What are you waiting for!?""One reviewer says the ending was worse than Showgirls. Well, in my eyes anyone who even watched that film shouldn't be trusted to give a fair review. I never even watched Showgirls just for the record. Another reviewer says we saw this already in Vacancy. Not really. Vacancy doesn't even come close to creating the suspense that fills most of the running time in The Strangers. One reviewer says this is as bland as dry toast. Maybe she was drunk when she was eating her dry toast and writing her review? One reviewer says at least Saw had gore and sadistic violence. Anyone who aspires to gore and violence in their choice of films and think that it is quality filmmaking, they shouldn't be writing a review. ""Travis Deputy"" has given one of the most moronic reviews here. One issue he seems to have is that the film didn't tell us if Liv's character had survived and if the Strangers were caught. And we needed to see this why? A film is more than fine when it is left open-ended. (Hint hint: Think about the ending to Hitchcock's The Birds). Then he says ""Aren't some films just wonderful?"" Yes, they are. Like this one! Some reviewers say this is cliched because of the phones not working, the girl twists her ankle, etc. Let me just remind everyone that this is a movie. If the phones worked and they called the police, we would have a 30-minute film. And so what if she twists her ankle? Maybe the director is tipping his hat to the old-school horror films we all know and love. Find something else to complain about. I know, how about the Black Christmas and Prom Night remakes, films that really deserve the 1-star rating. There are also other reviewers who aren't happy when something scary doesn't happen within the first 15 minutes. If they would practice some patience and get to know the characters so the film can establish a backdrop, the suspense will happen soon enough. And in The Strangers, it did and once it started, it never let up and the payoff was more than rewarding.The reason why I loved this film is because A. It was very intense and kept me interested and on edge the entire time B. The story was kept simple (simplicity being key) and captured the spirit of old school horror films C. The music and atmosphere used was very effective and downright chilling D. We did not know much about the Strangers so there was a sense of mystery which is lacking these days. I don't need everything spelled out for me in black and white to enjoy it. Was their an explanation in Halloween as to why Michael Myers was terrorizing Laurie Strode? Did we learn who the killer was in the 1974 horror gem Black Christmas? I guess people can't use their imaginations and want a motive like maybe the Strangers were getting revenge because one of their friends was killed by the couple or the couple was living in the Strangers old home, and they wanted it back. Maybe these Strangers were just born sick, plain and simple. Again, human beings of this nature is what true terror is.I commend Bryan Bertino for his excellent direction and actors Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman who did a wonderful job. Liv looks as gorgeous as ever here. This film went back to the basics and as the Amazon reviewer stated, earned its scares the old-fashioned way. An isolated home in the woods, people knocking on your door in the middle of the night, an atmosphere of dread and doom, haunting music that heightens the suspense, a thrilling game of cat and mouse, it all adds up to one awesome horror flick! Do not miss this and ignore the poor reviews given by others. These are people who probably consider I Still Know What You Did Last Summer a good horror film or who just have bad taste in general. If you enjoy horror films that put the focus on the unexplained, suspense, atmosphere, music and characters, this is your kind of film. If you want fancy special effects, a love story with a happy ending or torture and gore, go rent something else. This film is all about putting the audience through the suspense ringer and it succeeds very well!Also recommended is Neil Marshall's The Descent and Alexandre Aja's High Tension, both of which earn their scares the old-fashioned way much like The Strangers and keep your nerves on edge throughout!Note: As of 11/10/08 a 6.3/10 rating on IMDb.",5,One of the BEST and most original horror films in

1178863,A387BD735MI50R,B001D2WU8O,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","In the Director's Commentary on this DVD, Bryan Bertino makes the distinction between ""terror"" and ""horror,"" and categorizes ""The Strangers"" firmly in the former genre. That set me thinking, ""What's the difference?""I suppose ""horror"" carries a connotation of some supernatural entity doing the menacing. Whereas ""terror"" is perpetrated strictly by worldly beings. If that is indeed the difference, then yes, this movie is definitely terror. It plays into one of our primal fears about having our homes, our sanctuaries invaded by very real humans, but humans with a psychopathic bent, humans willing to casually commit the most horrible crimes - just for fun. That's what this movie is about. ""The Strangers"" are strange, not in the sense of being from some other plane or planet - but even more horrifyingly, because while they are physically human, they are alien to the human spirit.This movie has a few problems delivering the chills on this score. The picture projected on my screen was so murky, that sometimes the action was almost just a smudge. I know a Director would want to keep things indistinct to heighten suspense - to keep us guessing what is lurking in those shadows behind the curtains, in the other room. But the obscurantism of ""The Strangers"" often seems as if it might be due more to a low budget and poor production values than to intentional effect.Then I don't think the movie allows us to get to know the threatened couple enough to sufficiently care about them. There seemed to be some vitally missing back-story for them. In fact, the beginning of the movie made me feel as if my DVD might be defective, as if it was missing a few scenes. I got so distracted trying to figure out what sort of quarrel might be behind the couple's initial strained silence and disaffection - that the growing menace which is the point of the film was somewhat diluted for me.Nevertheless, this is a scary movie - good for raising goosebumps, and maybe some deeper issues about people's capacity for evil. Then if you can stomach the genre, you might want to check out ""Funny Games"" - another movie about brutal home invaders. But get the German-language original.",3,Murky Terror,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,2174,"['Director', 'Commentary', 'DVD', 'Bryan', 'Bertino', 'distinction', 'terror', 'horror', 'Strangers', 'firmly', 'former', 'genre', 'set', 'thinking', 'What', 'difference', 'suppose', 'horror', 'connotation', 'supernatural', 'entity', 'doing', 'menacing', 'terror', 'perpetrated', 'strictly', 'worldly', 'beings', 'indeed', 'difference', 'then', 'yes', 'movie', 'definitely', 'terror', 'one', 'primal', 'fears', 'having', 'homes', 'sanctuaries', 'invaded', 'very', 'real', 'humans', 'humans', 'psychopathic', 'bent', 'humans', 'willing', 'casually', 'commit', 'most', 'horrible', 'crimes', 'just', 'fun', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'Strangers', 'are', 'strange', 'not', 'sense', 'being', 'other', 'plane', 'planet', 'even', 'more', 'horrifyingly', 'are', 'physically', 'human', 'are', 'alien', 'human', 'spirit.This', 'movie', 'few', 'problems', 'delivering', 'chills', 'score', 'picture', 'projected', 'screen', 'was', 'so', 'murky', 'action', 'was', 'almost', 'just', 'smudge', 'know', 'Director', 'would', 'want', 'keep', 'things', 'indistinct', 'heighten', 'suspense', 'keep', 'guessing', 'what', 'lurking', 'shadows', 'curtains', 'other', 'room', 'obscurantism', 'Strangers', 'often', 'might', 'be', 'due', 'more', 'low', 'budget', 'poor', 'production', 'values', 'intentional', 'effect.Then', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'get', 'know', 'threatened', 'couple', 'enough', 'sufficiently', 'care', 'seemed', 'be', 'vitally', 'missing', 'back-story', 'fact', 'beginning', 'movie', 'made', 'feel', 'DVD', 'might', 'be', 'defective', 'was', 'missing', 'few', 'scenes', 'got', 'so', 'distracted', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'sort', 'quarrel', 'might', 'be', 'couple', 'initial', 'strained', 'silence', 'disaffection', 'growing', 'menace', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'somewhat', 'diluted', 'me.Nevertheless', 'scary', 'movie', 'good', 'raising', 'goosebumps', 'maybe', 'deeper', 'issues', 'people', 'capacity', 'evil', 'Then', 'can', 'stomach', 'genre', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Funny', 'Games', 'movie', 'brutal', 'home', 'invaders', 'get', 'German-language', 'original']",N/A

Sorry, couldn't resist.Saying that this film is inspired by true events is like saying that Bambi was inspired by hunting season or Casablanca was inspired by The Big Bang. C'mon people, you're pushing it.I find it incredibly strange that a first time Director would even bother, or be allowed, to front a film with erroneous text and false information trying to convey a sense of credibility to the viewer, which  very quickly unravels. It's pretty easy to discover that the factoid:""On the night of February 11, 2005 Kristen McKay and James Hoyt went to a friend's wedding reception and then returned to the Hoyt family's summer home. The brutal events that took place there are still not entirely known.""... is complete fiction. The director repeatedly changes his story about what was the inspiration for this movie in his statements to the press and other interviews. He goes from the Keddie Cabin murders as a possible influence to the Manson Family murders.The film does benefit from very nice cinematography and a good budget, but that's about it. It seems that some real professionals within the industry turned up for work, but were given a weak script and some less-than-stellar acting.I also find it odd that some people think they can make a horror movie and yet what they produce is not horror at all. It's just a bad movie masquerading as a horror movie trying to capture some of market share available. This film is very clearly a scam in every sense of the word. What's next a horror movie with Hugh Grant involved in being a bachelor with narration and complete with an American love interest that just happens to be a movie star? Wait ... haven't we seen that already though?I was actually looking forward to seeing this for quite some time as the trailers looked intriguing. But I guess I should be mad at the trailer people for raising my expectations on this on not at the film for being awful.This is a weird project that takes court and homicide television and puts it onto the big screen. Knowing that this was all fake, but being fronted as the truth, made it feel as if I was watching a long episode of Dexter or Cold Case. Both two very good shows which deserve a movie more than this fake story did.Don't waste your time.

This film is very atmospheric and those are the best kinds of horror flicks for this horror movie fan.2. In spite of a bare bones plot of a couple whose relationship is at a crossroads when they are held captive and tortured for a night, this is quite a lot to this film.  The dialogue is often believable, considering the situation, and the use of noise/sound is expertly done in the film (I can't give you more here without giving away too much of the story).3. The film is very deliberately paced with excruciatingly slow moments that build suspense to fast-paced moments that you wish would slow down.4. The acting is first-rate.5. The direction is solid and confident.6. The setting is extremely claustrophobic in spite of the few outdoor scenes that are juxtaposed to the inside shots and where most of the action takes place.7. The faceless ""strangers"" are a throw back to theHalloweenandFriday the 13thera of slasher films.The Misses:1. The ending is vague and stupid.  This seems to be my usual complaint with movies today.  You get an intense story, believable and likable characters, and solid writing and directing until you get to the end where you stare stupidly at the screen and say, ""That's it?  You're ending it there?  You're kidding, right?""2.

1178885,A23FDMTREBQC7P,B001D2WU8O,Todd O'Rourke,"[1, 1]","I will not focus too much on the plot within ""The Strangers""; rather I will focus on the atmosphere as well as other elements that make this film worth watching.The basic premise of the plot revolves around two individuals, James and Kristen, a couple whose relationship is on rocky grounds when Kristen apparently turns James' proposal down.  They go to a remote cabin in the woods, where they were supposed to enjoy the weekend.  Their weekend doesn't go according to plan when a group of psychopaths decide to scare the living hell out of the couple.Lighting:The lack of light to protect the psychopaths is simple, yet effective.  Throughout the film, the viewer doesn't really get a sense of what these individuals look like.  When the audience witnesses one of these individuals, they are shrouded by darkness, effectively hiding their identities. The psychopaths are briefly seen throughout the woods running between trees, playing cat and mouse with the couple.  However, the scariest use of lighting used in the film occurs when the couple looks out their window to see one of the psychos simply standing there and watching them.  It is extremely creepy watching someone as they watch you.Props:The masks of the antagonists are also equally scary.  Ominous is probably the best word to describe the masks of the psychos.  Two of the individuals use a doll-like mask that is far from its original sweet and innocent intention.  The third individual uses a mournful, shroud-like mask that hides all emotions.True Events:The third part of this film that makes it horrifying; it is ""inspired by true events"".  I don't know about most people that use Amazon, but I live in the middle of the woods. My closest neighbor is roughly a half a mile away.  So when I found out that these events occur throughout the United States on a frequent basis, I began to psych myself out.  I had a feeling that if this could happen to these individuals, it could happen to me.Pros:* Creepy soundtrack* Scary psychopaths* Great lighting* Based on true eventsCons:* Poor plot development* Sub-par acting* The couple is ridiculously idiotic* Shoddy endingI give this film four out of five stars.",4,This Could Be You,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,2179,"['will', 'not', 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'Strangers', 'rather', 'will', 'focus', 'atmosphere', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'elements', 'make', 'film', 'watching.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'plot', 'around', 'two', 'individuals', 'James', 'Kristen', 'couple', 'relationship', 'rocky', 'grounds', 'when', 'Kristen', 'apparently', 'James', 'proposal', 'down', 'go', 'remote', 'cabin', 'woods', 'where', 'were', 'supposed', 'enjoy', 'weekend', 'weekend', ""n't"", 'go', 'according', 'plan', 'when', 'group', 'psychopaths', 'decide', 'scare', 'living', 'hell', 'couple.Lighting', 'lack', 'light', 'protect', 'psychopaths', 'simple', 'yet', 'effective', 'film', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'individuals', 'look', 'When', 'audience', 'one', 'individuals', 'are', 'shrouded', 'darkness', 'effectively', 'hiding', 'identities', 'psychopaths', 'are', 'briefly', 'seen', 'woods', 'running', 'trees', 'playing', 'cat', 'mouse', 'couple', 'However', 'scariest', 'use', 'lighting', 'used', 'film', 'when', 'couple', 'out', 'window', 'see', 'one', 'psychos', 'simply', 'standing', 'there', 'watching', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'watching', 'someone', 'watch', 'you.Props', 'masks', 'antagonists', 'are', 'also', 'equally', 'scary', 'Ominous', 'probably', 'best', 'word', 'describe', 'masks', 'psychos', 'Two', 'individuals', 'use', 'doll-like', 'mask', 'far', 'original', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'intention', 'third', 'individual', 'mournful', 'shroud-like', 'mask', 'emotions.True', 'Events', 'third', 'part', 'film', 'horrifying', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'most', 'people', 'use', 'Amazon', 'live', 'middle', 'woods', 'closest', 'neighbor', 'roughly', 'half', 'mile', 'away', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'events', 'occur', 'United', 'States', 'frequent', 'basis', 'began', 'psych', 'out', 'had', 'feeling', 'could', 'happen', 'individuals', 'could', 'happen', 'me.Pros', '*', 'Creepy', 'soundtrack*', 'Scary', 'psychopaths*', 'Great', 'lighting*', 'Based', 'true', 'eventsCons', '*', 'Poor', 'plot', 'development*', 'Sub-par', 'couple', 'ridiculously', 'idiotic*', 'Shoddy', 'endingI', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

1178888,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B001D2WU8O,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[3, 5]","""The Strangers"" seemed like a good horror movie when I first saw the trailers,however I didn't get to see it in theatres.Instead I rented it on DVD recently,and I have to say that I expected something totally different.I really tought there was a story,but after watching it I realize that there is no story at all,it's just a couple being attacked by strangers,sure there is enough with that idea to make tons of movie but this one just didn't make anything of it,it's like it just stops there.The idea sounds good on paper but what's been done with it is just plain awfull.What could have been a great movie has been ruined by so many things.I should have known better,it was supposed to be released in mid-2007 and it got delayed twice.The movie starts with the writtings on the screen : ""What you are about to see is inspired by true events. According to the F.B.I. there are an estimated 1.4 million violent crimes in America each year. On the night of February 11, 2005 Kristen McKay and James Hoyt went to a friend's wedding reception and then returned to the Hoyt family's summer home. The brutal events that took place there are still not entirely known"".Then the movie starts with a kid calling 9-1-1 saying he's in danger,afterwards the movie shifts to what happened before.Kristen and James are at their summer home after Kristen refused James's proposal.It's dark,they're talking and they hear loud knocks on the door...The fact that it mentions it was inspired by ""real"" events when it's not really the case.Director Bryan Bertino said that the event that inspired the movie was when someone came knocking at his door when he was young and asked for someone who didn't live there,the neighberhood's empty houses have been vandalized.That's the real part of it.One good thing about the movie is the two main actors Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman who do a pretty convincing job as victims.What those two characters did was pretty stupid and predictable at times(the girl running and breaking her leg is an exemple of something that's been done countless times before).The strangers were also solidely portrayed but then again put a mask on anyone who doesn't really talk in the movie and you've got your bad guys.They made the strangers seem supernatural and inhuman but that was probably the point,it can be frustrating tought.The fact that you don't know anything about the strangers is frustrating you have no reasons as to why they did it or who they are,it's really just people wearing masks killing innocent people.All along you're watching waiting for sort kind of revelation that won't happen,there's just no point at all.You don't get the feeling that there was anything behind those murders in the movie wich makes it pointless.I know some people like the movie but I just can't.The first few minutes of the movie are intriguing and create an atmosphere of suspense,unfortunatly it doesn't get any better.The movie ain't really scary,it's scary how it's awfull tought.I jumped on a particular scene that really surprised me but that's it.The strangers is not worth buying,so if you really want to see it,just rent it I advise you.The worst part is that they are actually going to make a sequel to this movie .",1,"""Because You Where

1178889,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B001D2WU8O,trashcanman,"[13, 22]","Rant mode: engaged.The horror remake is a genre that needs to die right the hell now.  People who buy tickets to this sort of thing, puchase the DVDs, and tell people that drek like this is good: you are the problem and the reason Hollywood doesn't bother with things like imagination and creativity anymore. Support the real deal and shun garbage like ""The Strangers"" or great American horror will simply cease to be.Throw a few attractive, brainless, vapid characters with the common sense of a moth into a secluded location, create an entire subplot about why they can't use their cellphone (the newest hateful cliche to besmirch my favorite film genre), send in psychic faceless killers who can disappear and reappear at will, cue cheap startle scares and old music -preferably played on an old-time record player, and call it a film.  Oh, yes, I forgot the best part: claim it was based on a true story.  This is to say that once upon a time, some people died and nobody really knows how or why.  So just use their actual names and location and build a preposterously moronic excuse for a story and watch the sheep pay their hard-earned cash for the latest horror fraud.  This is the last remake I will ever watch that isn't put in the hands of a director I know only puts out quality work. In fact, I received this by accident and watchd it grudgingly.  I wish I had sent it back without even opening it.  I could have spent that time doing something else.  Anything else.Now, I haven't yet seenThem (a.k.a. Ils), the film alegedly based on the real events that was remade as ""The Strangers"",  but I may well skip it if the plot is as hollow and the ""scares"" as impotent as they are here.  I was literally calling every attempted scare as it happened in my mind.  Oh look, he doesn't see her in the closet, but as soon as he appears to move on BAM!  From the side! Startled yet?  Maybe if you've never ever seen a slasher flick.  Of course they know where everybody is; they ALWAYS KNOW in spite of the crummy visibility their masks must offer.  Here's the entire plot.  Unlikeable mumbling couple lull you half to sleep before Liv Tyler (still almost as hot as her dad is rockin') puts on a nighty to make things watchable.  Panties come off and....knock knock.  Man shoos off bizarre 4 AM knocker girl and promptly ditches his wife under these creepy circumstances.  About 45 knocks later, you get the only legitimate scare in the film.  It's been done, but it's done well here right before it is undone by the mega-cliche of having the masked stalker behind our protagonist vanish as she turns around.  That was when I knew I was in for a long night.  Moving on: 3 wierdos in unscary masks continue play pranks on our couple all night before remembering what they wanted to do the next day and then going on about their pointless business.  The end.Details, you ask?  You'll be sorryyy...Masked killers to affluent couple: ""Ha ha, popped your tires and busted your windshield, losers!  Pwned!""  ""I totally wrote 'hello' all over your mirror, dudes!  Isn't that FREAKY!""  ""I'm gonna cuuuut yooooouu. No, not really. No really, I am!  See me scraping the knife on stuff as I slowly walk towards you?  Creepy!  I'm really gonna cut you.  NOT!""So the requisite friend comes to visit and enters the fugged-up house without so much as a ""hello, anyone home"" while the couple are huddled in a room with a shotgun pointed at the door.  Gee, I can't imagine how this will end.  Oh, wait, there's a sranger totally following him with an axe so.... nope, ironic cliche overdrive still in effect.  Snore.  Oh, look the big man with a gun is ditching his lady again.  Why?  Because he's an idiot.  How about BOTH OF YOU going outside together so that you two with the friggin' gun and pockets full of shells have a wide open view and can therefore shoot any of the three knife and hatchet wielding masked losers trying to prank you to death?  No?  You'd rather get snuck up on trying to hotwire a vehicle while your wife sits in the house alone with her face buried in her knees and the dude with a gunney sack on his head stares at her while doing that head-tilting thing that hasn't been effective since ""Halloween""?  Alright, I guess that's what any reasonable couple in peril would do.  Does anyody find any of this believable or remotely scary?  Anyone?Horror films based entirely off of people's stupidity (both the audience's and the characters') should have ended whenScreamdropped.  If we keep gobbling it up, Hollywood will happily continue to crank out mountains of cinematic feces.  If I was 12 and had never seenHalloween, this may have creepd me out then.  But when I'm acutely aware of how every single scene will end and actively annoyed by the stupidity of each and every character, a tension and suspense vacuum inevitably results.  The ending is particularly laughable.  The final shot is the most cliche of them all and the only thing remotely disturbing about the stangers' parting line ""next time wil be easier"" is that it implies a possible sequel.  That and the only way to make it easier would have been to not act like a bunch of prank-crazed teleporting fratboys who have seen too many slasher films for an entire night before finally doing what they presumably came to do (for no reason, mind you) in broad daylight to a couple that appeared to desire nothing more than death's sweet release from the opening scene.  If you want to see a horror film with a similar concept that is the real deal, pick up a copy ofInside.  This is neither horror nor suspense.  This is unintentional comedy and tragedy of the lamest kind.  Avoid at all costs. Support original horror (American or foreign) or I'll find a mask of my own.  I know where you live.  I am the masked stranger and I always know where you are and I can totally teleport and stuff.  Perhaps one day you will have scary stuff like ""hello"" written on your mirror by me.

Sounds familiar?Maybe this is accidental, but the film's story looks very familiar - which reminds us of ""Funny Games"" ""Vacancy"" and of course, David Moreau and Xavier Palud's French thriller ""Them"" - but what disappointed me is not the similarity in story. It is something different.The problem with this film is that most scares are clich&eacute;d. Despite its promising atmospheric opening scenes, the film largely depends on old tricks such as sudden appearance (and disappearance) of something or someone, big banging noises, useless cell phones and cars, and yes, a wardrobe. Please no more wardrobe. Even the final act (that is obviously trying to shock us) looks predictable.""The Strangers"" is the first film by Bryan Bertino who also wrote the script. He may not be the most innovative writer, but it is certain he can direct. There is one tense scene in the middle of the film, which involves Glenn Howerton's character, and Peter Sova's dark, brooding photography and tomandandy's score is also effective.Not the worst horror film ever made, but definitely not the scariest.

I hate these types of movies, but my roommate's daughter talked us into watching it; and, even knowing what was going to happen, I got caught up in the plot and found myself shouting at the TV, thinking that the two lead characters (Liv Tyler & Scott Speedman)could actually hear my warnings to them.  I never do that when I watch a movie, but this film played on suspense and anticipation, rather than outright violence, except at the end, and hooked me line and sinker.  It also worked on my innate fears, playing them like a maestro would a violin, causing me to think about buying a .44 Magnum encase stead someone starts knocking on my door in the middle of the night.  I think the small group of actors did one-hell-of-a-great job for this low-budget movie, with Liv Tyler carrying a large part of the film on her very skilled shoulders.  She and Scott Speedman certainly did a marvelous job at the beginning of the movie in setting up their relationship with each other.  These were people I liked and cared about, not wanting to see them hurt or killed.  I also liked the fact that you never really see the faces of the killers (except for the girl who was knocking on the front door) though they take off their masks at the end, before doing the dirty deed so that the victims can see who they are.The writer/director, Bryan Bertino, definitely has talent as a film maker, and I can see a bright career ahead of him in the Hollywood movie industry.  He knows how to reel in an audience and to keep them constantly guessing as to the outcome.  And, no, I'm not really Bryan Bertino, writing a good review of my film under a fake name.  I'm just a movie buff who found myself enjoying The Strangers against all odds, when I actually expected to hate the movie.

A perfect example, MNS too-dreadful-for-words,, ""The Happening.""  Avenging trees and horror do not mix.  Onto ""The Strangers,."" which I loved.  I thought it was concise, brutal, harrowing and taut and it was all pulled off expertly by those involved.  The camerawork was fantastic and the way the interiors were filmed, with deep pockets of shadows everywhere, turned an otherwise nice country house into an ominous and terrifying trap.  The exterior shots, though ample, gave the feeling of crushing claustrophobia, the overwhelming feeling of being trapped even where you are outside and free to move.  Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman were great, their terror and anxiety both palpable and believable.  The nihilistic ending didn't put me off, because that's life, sometimes.  Nice resolutions aren't always part of the deal.  For me, ultimately, it's how well the material is handled that really determines the quality of the film.  If you have good craftsmen at work, who really care about what they're doing, you'll end up with a more than decent flick, more often than not.  Here we have a very good example.  If  you are expecting some kind of epiphany, you'll be disappointed; however, if you want a well-made, grab you by the throat kind of cinematic experience, then I suggest you check out ""The Strangers.""

1178904,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001D2WU8O,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[9, 13]","After watching the French-horror thriller ""THEM"" a few months ago, I didn't really have high hopes for this supposed ""based"" on true events film: ""THE STRANGERS"". If this isn't a remake, it certainly has strong similarities. (Maybe this was also based on the incident in Romania?) ""Them"" came out around 2006, if this was written before, what took it so long to be made? The quality of the film doesn't reflect anything special to cause a delay in its release. The French film was based on true events that happened in Romania; ""Them"" was full of atmosphere and the actors portrayed a very panicked couple who were trying to survive. ""The Strangers"" is no different, very similar premise--with a slightly different screenplay, comparisons will be made and this film gives a feeling of Deja Vu. So how does it compare to the French Horror thriller?A young couple, James and Kristen (Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler respectively) goes to a summer house after attending a wedding for a little ""R & R"". Apparently their ""love"" had become strained due to the fact that Kristen had rejected James' proposal. The two are quite uncomfortable around each other with James acting embarrassed about the whole thing. The two thought that they could try to reconnect with each other this evening, little do they know that this may become their most horrific night together as the summer house is assaulted by ""The Strangers""...I had mixed feelings about ""Them"", but I can very well say that the French take on this idea is a lot better than this film. This film would have done a lot better if it just remade ""Them"" shot for shot, and avoided any attempts at another screenplay. There isn't much that happens in ""The Strangers"" and while I do accept the idea of one night--a couple--in a big house--attacked by home invaders--the film resorted to the usual weaknesses that made horror films so full of clich&eacute;.The usual clich&eacute;s are present in this film; very idiotic decisions, panicked reactions that doesn't make any sense and antagonists that ""toy"" with their victims. At least, in ""Them"" the couple were making credible attempts to survive; in this remake, James and Kristen seem to be just waiting for death. Sure, the antagonists were probably ""spooking"" them out, but all their reactions did not make sense. All the potentially ""good"" decisions were abandoned so the film can get to where it wanted to go. Talk about ""Lambs to the Slaughter""...Now, I can ignore clich&eacute;s as long as the film knows where it is going but here, the antagonists spend a very significant amount of time standing around, walking the house and trying to intimidate --writing notes in walls and windows with red (I assume either) lipstick or paint; the film just dawdles too much in trying to be creepy that it lost all elements of realism. (This is supposed to be based on a real story, right?) The lack of character development may be ignored so long as one can relate to the characters, when the viewer is immersed in the proceedings. The antagonists are all wearing masks that look rather silly and one look at those masks you'd know their intentions were obviously hostile. ""Them"" had it right with the hooded sweaters and the trickery with the shadows. Director Bryan Bertino definitely wanted to add some nice visuals and plays on ambiguity to try to make the film disturbing.To its credit, the performance by Liv Tyler was quite good and she managed to show a lot of emotion. Scott Speedman had so little to work with, so I couldn't really say if his performance was bad or not. The ""strained"" romance thing does add some empathy to our characters. I was somewhat pleased that they weren't the usual happy couple. The film's cinematography is also quite atmospheric, although some elements looked too polished to really be claustrophobic. There were some intense moments that managed to give an unnerving feeling but the unsteady suspense just lost a lot of its ""punch"". The film is just based on clich&eacute;s and idiocy, it is difficult to promote suspense when the build up is based on these formulas.I do think this film would have done better without the ""based on true events"" gimmick. The ""true events"" thing will have to be met by realism and once you don't see that one defining factor, no matter how good the set-ups are, you may just fail. The film is supposed to be violent and disturbing, but for some reason, it felt oddly ""tame"" and irrelevant. Bertino's attempts for suspense relied too much on cheap scares and spooky sound effects. The director ends up relying on overused genre mechanics that overstays its welcome.For a film supposedly based on ""true"" events, ""The Strangers"" just falls flat. It even lacked the original's disturbing finale. The film would have been better off billed as a ""slasher"" flick than an involving horror drama that supposedly hits closer to home.The dvd's unrated version clocks in 87 minutes while the theatrical version is at 85 minutes. Both versions are in the dvd. The extra two minutes of running time is on James' additional seconds of  shooting and Kristen drags herself on the floor, for more of a ""tormented"" effect.RENTAL [2  Stars]",3,"2  Stars: Remake of the French Horror-Thriller ""THEM"" or Written before that film?

1178906,AP3B615GM191G,B001D2WU8O,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","I think that the ""scariness"" factor of this film is the fact that its events were based on a true life scenario.  While coming home late from a party one night, a man and his fiancee are terrorized by three people wearing various masks.That scenario, I will admit, is pretty spooky...the idea that someone is stalking you within your own home is truly horrifying.  However, in film format, the story falls a bit flat for two reasons:First off, there really aren't any big ""jump moments"" (at least ones that aren't given away in the trailer) for all the suspense that is generated.  Time after time, the tension builds and then just fades away.  I think that a truly good horror movie needs to really deliver on those jump scenes (even though our heart rates increase, we really do want to be scared), otherwise the audience will no longer be on the edge of their seat, which is exactly what happened to me towards the end of the film.Secondly, there is no resolution to the film.  I guess a sequel is currently in the works, so perhaps that will explain why the masked tormentors are picking on two specific individuals, but in the context of this film, the acts are completely random.  I think that was supposed to be part of this film's appeal, but it did not leave me with a good impression of the overall movie upon its conclusion.So, if you are one of those people who can completely immerse yourself in the action of the film, you will find this movie more compelling than I did.  However, if (like me) you like a few contrived scares and understandable plot motivations, then you should probably steer clear of this film.",3,"True Events Are Scary, But Film Adaptation Falls A Bit Flat",1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,1628,"['think', 'scariness', 'factor', 'film', 'fact', 'events', 'were', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'scenario', 'coming', 'home', 'late', 'party', 'one', 'night', 'man', 'fiancee', 'are', 'terrorized', 'three', 'people', 'wearing', 'various', 'masks.That', 'scenario', 'will', 'admit', 'pretty', 'spooky', 'idea', 'someone', 'stalking', 'own', 'home', 'truly', 'horrifying', 'However', 'film', 'format', 'story', 'bit', 'flat', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'off', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'jump', 'moments', 'least', 'ones', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'away', 'trailer', 'suspense', 'generated', 'Time', 'time', 'tension', 'builds', 'then', 'just', 'fades', 'away', 'think', 'truly', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'really', 'deliver', 'jump', 'scenes', 'even', 'heart', 'rates', 'increase', 'really', 'do', 'want', 'be', 'scared', 'otherwise', 'audience', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'edge', 'seat', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'film.Secondly', 'resolution', 'film', 'guess', 'sequel', 'currently', 'works', 'so', 'perhaps', 'will', 'explain', 'why', 'masked', 'tormentors', 'are', 'picking', 'two', 'specific', 'individuals', 'context', 'film', 'acts', 'are', 'completely', 'random', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'part', 'film', 'appeal', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'good', 'impression', 'overall', 'movie', 'conclusion.So', 'are', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'completely', 'immerse', 'action', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'more', 'compelling', 'did', 'However', 'few', 'contrived', 'scares', 'understandable', 'plot', 'motivations', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'steer', 'clear', 'film']",N/A
1178907,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001D2WU8O,Z Hayes,"[2, 3]","""The Strangers"" is not exactly an original movie - it is a remake of the 2006 French movie Them which I thought was more tautly made and well-defined in terms of characterization. Also, The Strangers brought to mind another movie ""Funny Games"" with Naomi Watts [2008] which also happens to be a remake of Michael Hanneke's 1997 Swedish movie of the same name. The basic difference? In Funny Games, the victims know all too well who their psychopathic tormentors are, but not so in The Strangers.Watching The Strangers [just like Funny Games] was a disturbing experience for me - because of the hopelessness of it all - we may root for the couple in this movie to make it through their ordeal [and Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler do a pretty convincing job in their roles as likable victims] but we also get this sickening sensation in the pit of our stomachs that their tormentors aren't people one can plead mercy with. It all seems a pointless exercise and just emphasizes how empty some souls truly are.So what made me sit through the movie? Well, the scare tactics were quite unsettling - the use of masks by the villains was a convincing cinematic tool as it completely dehumanizes them and the effects are thus all the more chilling. The sound effects were simple yet effective in conveying how totally vulnerable the victims are [banging on doors, glass shattering, folksy music playing in the background,  etc]. Of course, as with many horror movies, the protagonists do some pretty stupid things that has us going ""What???"" but all in all, the creepy factor outweighs these lapses in judgment. It also helps that the movie isn't too long, about 87 mins total running time. The convincing character portrayal by Liv Tyler especially had me rooting for her to make it right till the end.Gore factor - not much, this is not a splatterfest though there is plenty of violence and blood at the end.Final verdict - watchable psycho horror/thriller.",4,A tale of depravity [3.5 *],1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,1947,"['Strangers', 'not', 'exactly', 'original', 'movie', 'remake', '2006', 'French', 'movie', 'Them', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'tautly', 'made', 'well-defined', 'terms', 'characterization', 'Also', 'Strangers', 'brought', 'mind', 'movie', 'Funny', 'Games', 'Naomi', 'Watts', '[', '2008', ']', 'also', 'be', 'remake', 'Michael', 'Hanneke', '1997', 'Swedish', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'basic', 'difference', 'Funny', 'Games', 'victims', 'know', 'too', 'well', 'who', 'psychopathic', 'tormentors', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'Strangers.Watching', 'Strangers', '[', 'just', 'Funny', 'Games', ']', 'was', 'disturbing', 'experience', 'hopelessness', 'may', 'root', 'couple', 'movie', 'make', 'ordeal', '[', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'do', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'job', 'roles', 'likable', 'victims', ']', 'also', 'get', 'sickening', 'sensation', 'pit', 'stomachs', 'tormentors', 'are', ""n't"", 'people', 'one', 'can', 'plead', 'mercy', 'pointless', 'exercise', 'just', 'emphasizes', 'how', 'empty', 'souls', 'truly', 'are.So', 'what', 'made', 'sit', 'movie', 'Well', 'scare', 'tactics', 'were', 'quite', 'unsettling', 'use', 'masks', 'villains', 'was', 'convincing', 'cinematic', 'tool', 'completely', 'effects', 'are', 'thus', 'more', 'chilling', 'sound', 'effects', 'were', 'simple', 'yet', 'effective', 'conveying', 'how', 'totally', 'vulnerable', 'victims', 'are', '[', 'banging', 'doors', 'glass', 'shattering', 'folksy', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'etc', ']', 'course', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'protagonists', 'do', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'things', 'going', 'What', 'creepy', 'factor', 'lapses', 'judgment', 'also', 'movie', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', '87', 'mins', 'total', 'running', 'time', 'convincing', 'character', 'portrayal', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'especially', 'had', 'rooting', 'make', 'right', 'end.Gore', 'factor', 'not', 'much', 'not', 'splatterfest', 'plenty', 'violence', 'blood', 'end.Final', 'verdict', 'watchable', 'psycho', 'horror/thriller']",N/A
