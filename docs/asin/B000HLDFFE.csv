If you can get by that in the first few minutes the rest of the film is great! I found it entertaining and thought provoking, as I often wondered how I would fare if dumped in similar situation. Good for an evening, but a bit long (over three hrs).",5,Robinson Crusoe UPDATED!,1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,325,"['Timeless', 'classic', 'only', 'drawback', 'dubbing', 'French', 'English', 'can', 'get', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'rest', 'film', 'great', 'found', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking', 'often', 'wondered', 'how', 'would', 'fare', 'dumped', 'similar', 'situation', 'Good', 'evening', 'bit', 'long', 'three', 'hrs']",The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe

My wife and I had to laugh at times over the poor quality of not only the English dubbing, but the dialog itself. the pierce Brosnon version is pretty bad, but this makes it seem like citizen kane in comparison.  I went by the reviews.....boy, what were you thinking?  If you want a descent Crusoe movie, I recommend Crusoe, with Aiden Quinn. It is not true to the book, and didn't win any awards, but it the best of the three mentioned in my review.  as for this one, we didn't finish it and threw it out.  hope this saves someone from buying it and being disapointed.",1,Absolutly horrible!!,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,620,"['one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'wife', 'had', 'laugh', 'times', 'poor', 'quality', 'not', 'only', 'English', 'dubbing', 'dialog', 'pierce', 'Brosnon', 'version', 'pretty', 'bad', 'seem', 'citizen', 'kane', 'comparison', 'went', 'reviews', '..boy', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'want', 'descent', 'Crusoe', 'movie', 'recommend', 'Crusoe', 'Aiden', 'Quinn', 'not', 'true', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'best', 'three', 'mentioned', 'review', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'threw', 'out', 'hope', 'someone', 'buying', 'being', 'disapointed']",The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe

Actually the best acting is done by the guy who plays Friday and he looks the part. Good entertainment and makes one want to escape to the islands - without the cannibals of course.

1015276,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000HLDFFE,Robert J. Crawford,"[6, 7]","This a a very good version of an old classic, occurring about 100 years after the original (in 18C not 17C).  Crusoe is a civilized man who finds himself alone of the island for many years, falling into a bit of savagery and engaging in a long dialogue with his God.  Along comes Friday from a group of competing cannibals, and they begin a conflicted and complicated relationship that is funny and engaging.  Friday doesn't buy a lot of Crusoe's ideas, from wearing shirts to the promises of catholicism, but he does appreciate Crusoe and they learn to live together, in mutual respect.  This is very well done, with a near anthropological sensibility and truly fine acting, esp. Friday.  There are also two subplots in the book, one about why Crusoe was set adrift with a aftermath that is significant and the other about Friday's uneasy reception in a slave-holding colony and their subsequent departure for Europe, where further conflict and prejudice surely await.Unfortunately, this is a clunkily dubbed copy of a French film, without the option to watch it in the original version.  I was able to forget about this because of the quality of the film, but it was so poorly done that I almost stopped watching it in the beginning.  Recommended as an excellent extension of the original story, which I now feel inspired to read.",4,Crusoe as  shamed by Friday and uplifted by him,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,1332,"['very', 'good', 'version', 'old', 'classic', 'occurring', '100', 'years', 'original', '18C', 'not', '17C', 'Crusoe', 'civilized', 'man', 'who', 'alone', 'island', 'many', 'years', 'falling', 'bit', 'savagery', 'engaging', 'long', 'dialogue', 'God', 'Along', 'Friday', 'group', 'competing', 'cannibals', 'begin', 'conflicted', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'funny', 'engaging', 'Friday', ""n't"", 'buy', 'lot', 'Crusoe', 'ideas', 'wearing', 'shirts', 'promises', 'catholicism', 'appreciate', 'Crusoe', 'learn', 'live', 'together', 'mutual', 'respect', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'near', 'anthropological', 'sensibility', 'truly', 'fine', 'acting', 'esp', 'Friday', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'subplots', 'book', 'one', 'why', 'Crusoe', 'was', 'set', 'adrift', 'aftermath', 'significant', 'other', 'Friday', 'uneasy', 'reception', 'slave-holding', 'colony', 'subsequent', 'departure', 'Europe', 'where', 'further', 'conflict', 'prejudice', 'surely', 'await.Unfortunately', 'clunkily', 'dubbed', 'copy', 'French', 'film', 'option', 'watch', 'original', 'version', 'was', 'able', 'forget', 'quality', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'done', 'almost', 'stopped', 'watching', 'beginning', 'Recommended', 'excellent', 'extension', 'original', 'story', 'now', 'feel', 'inspired', 'read']",The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe
