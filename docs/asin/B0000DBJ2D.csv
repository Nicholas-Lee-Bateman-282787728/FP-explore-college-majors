777768,A5JLAU2ARJ0BO,B0000DBJ2D,"Gadgester ""No Time, No Money""","[4, 5]","There's no doubt that ""The Legend of Suriyothai"" was a major undertaking in Thailand's film history, and it was a super blockbuster there upon release for a good reason: it was a film about nationalism, about how one Thai queen made sacrifices (some of which might have been of questionable intent) to protect her husband.While the film has nice cinematography, staging and music, it tries to cover too many things, at least for the Western audience, and ends up lacking focus, esp. in the first half, when the power struggle between the faction of which Suriyothai was a member and a royal consort who wanted to resurrect her clan's dominance of Siam.  As I watched how the latter tried to wrestle the throne from her husband, the king, I was confused: why would a movie about ""the legend of Suriyothai"" spend 1/3 of its time on someone else?First, a little background in case you were also confused about who was who and what was what.Ayuthaya was the 16th-century capital of Siam, which was made up of several kingdoms.  The ruler of Ayuthaya was the ""king of kings,"" and the other kings were supposed to swear allegiance to him and his heir.  This was somewhat like the Japanese shogunate system at the same time, whereby the warlords (shoguns, literally meaning generals) were supposed to be loyal to the emperor, who ruled out of Endo (modern Tokyo).  Just like in Japan, this kind of confederate system was fertile ground for disloyalty and treachery.Suriyothai, the daughter of a minor lord living in one of the small kingdoms, was forced into marriage to Prince Tien, whose father became king of Ayuthaya.  Prince Tien was not heir to the throne because his mom was a concubine, not a ""high consort"", let alone queen.  Power struggles erupted over succession after Prince Tien's father died.  One of the most memorable scenes in the movie involves the fate of Tien's half-brother, a little boy who was king for only six months.After Tien's cousin took over the throne, he went to fight the Burmese.  Historically, Burma and Thailand has had bitter rivalry for centuries, mostly over land and women.  When the king is going, his high consort schemed to overthrow him and restore her clan's claim to throne.  One thing led to another, eventually Suriyothai helped her husband Tien become the ruler of Siam.The last 50 minutes of the 2-hour-20-minute film is about a Siamese-Burmese war.  Some well-staged battle scenes (with real people and real elephants) in this part make this a worthy film to watch for people interested in world history, esp. the history of southeast Asia.  Finally, you understand why they call the film ""the legend of Suriyothai"" and how she made the ""ultimate sacrifice"" the narrator had promised to show you at the beginning of the film.As you can see, the film has a lot of storylines, as it covers a span of 20 years of Thai (Siamese) history.  Not only did I find the film lacking a focus for the first 2/3, but the acting quite stiff, as if the actors were just reading scripts.  My mind started wandering away as the film kind of dragged on and became difficult to understand with so many hard-to-remember names scrolling by so fast.  It was until the two-hour mark or so that the film regained its footing, at least in terms of having a followable, focused story.After finishing the film and feeling rather confused and exhausted, I nonetheless had no regrets renting the DVD.  In fact, the character of Suriyothai kinda stuck in my head so I rewatched the first part, in order to understand what was really going on.  I still found the palace intrigues too much to follow, but at least I began to know who was who and what was what.",3,A major undertaking with severe flaws,1106870400,"01 28, 2005",2005,3672,"['doubt', 'Legend', 'Suriyothai', 'was', 'major', 'undertaking', 'Thailand', 'film', 'history', 'was', 'super', 'blockbuster', 'release', 'good', 'reason', 'was', 'film', 'nationalism', 'how', 'one', 'Thai', 'queen', 'made', 'sacrifices', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'questionable', 'intent', 'protect', 'film', 'nice', 'cinematography', 'staging', 'music', 'cover', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'least', 'Western', 'audience', 'up', 'lacking', 'focus', 'esp', 'first', 'half', 'when', 'power', 'struggle', 'faction', 'Suriyothai', 'was', 'member', 'royal', 'consort', 'who', 'wanted', 'resurrect', 'clan', 'dominance', 'Siam', 'watched', 'how', 'latter', 'tried', 'wrestle', 'throne', 'husband', 'king', 'was', 'confused', 'why', 'would', 'movie', 'legend', 'Suriyothai', 'spend', '1/3', 'time', 'someone', 'else', 'First', 'little', 'background', 'case', 'were', 'also', 'confused', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'what.Ayuthaya', 'was', '16th-century', 'capital', 'Siam', 'was', 'made', 'several', 'kingdoms', 'ruler', 'Ayuthaya', 'was', 'king', 'kings', 'other', 'kings', 'were', 'supposed', 'swear', 'allegiance', 'heir', 'was', 'somewhat', 'Japanese', 'shogunate', 'system', 'same', 'time', 'whereby', 'warlords', 'shoguns', 'literally', 'meaning', 'generals', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'loyal', 'emperor', 'who', 'ruled', 'Endo', 'modern', 'Tokyo', 'Just', 'Japan', 'kind', 'confederate', 'system', 'was', 'fertile', 'ground', 'disloyalty', 'treachery.Suriyothai', 'daughter', 'minor', 'lord', 'living', 'one', 'small', 'kingdoms', 'was', 'forced', 'marriage', 'Prince', 'Tien', 'father', 'became', 'king', 'Ayuthaya', 'Prince', 'Tien', 'was', 'not', 'heir', 'throne', 'mom', 'was', 'concubine', 'not', 'high', 'consort', 'let', 'alone', 'queen', 'Power', 'struggles', 'erupted', 'succession', 'Prince', 'Tien', 'father', 'died', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'movie', 'fate', 'Tien', 'half-brother', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'king', 'only', 'six', 'months.After', 'Tien', 'cousin', 'took', 'over', 'throne', 'went', 'fight', 'Burmese', 'Historically', 'Burma', 'Thailand', 'had', 'bitter', 'rivalry', 'centuries', 'mostly', 'land', 'women', 'When', 'king', 'going', 'high', 'consort', 'schemed', 'overthrow', 'restore', 'clan', 'claim', 'throne', 'One', 'thing', 'led', 'eventually', 'Suriyothai', 'helped', 'husband', 'Tien', 'become', 'ruler', 'Siam.The', 'last', '50', 'minutes', '2-hour-20-minute', 'film', 'Siamese-Burmese', 'war', 'well-staged', 'battle', 'scenes', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'elephants', 'part', 'make', 'worthy', 'film', 'watch', 'people', 'interested', 'world', 'history', 'esp', 'history', 'southeast', 'Asia', 'Finally', 'understand', 'why', 'call', 'film', 'legend', 'Suriyothai', 'how', 'made', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'narrator', 'had', 'promised', 'show', 'beginning', 'film.As', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'lot', 'storylines', 'span', '20', 'years', 'Thai', 'Siamese', 'history', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'find', 'film', 'lacking', 'focus', 'first', '2/3', 'acting', 'quite', 'stiff', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'reading', 'scripts', 'mind', 'started', 'wandering', 'away', 'film', 'kind', 'dragged', 'became', 'difficult', 'understand', 'so', 'many', 'hard-to-remember', 'names', 'scrolling', 'fast', 'was', 'two-hour', 'mark', 'so', 'film', 'regained', 'footing', 'least', 'terms', 'having', 'followable', 'focused', 'story.After', 'finishing', 'film', 'feeling', 'rather', 'confused', 'exhausted', 'nonetheless', 'had', 'regrets', 'renting', 'DVD', 'fact', 'character', 'Suriyothai', 'kinda', 'stuck', 'head', 'rewatched', 'first', 'part', 'order', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'still', 'found', 'palace', 'too', 'much', 'follow', 'least', 'began', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'what']",The Legend of Suriyothai
777769,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000DBJ2D,Grady Harp,"[9, 9]","THE LEGEND OF SURIYOTHAI is as fine a study in Thai history as is available.  Obviously a Big Budget film (apparently financed by Thai Royalty) this is a no holds barred look at the legend of a woman (Suriyothai) in Siamese history circa 1540s who selflessly saved her country from annihilation both from civil unrest and from Burmese invasion.For those of us for whom this film is the first exposure to the ancient history of Siam/Thailand the going can be a bit rough in following the multitude of characters, the various kings and queens and consorts of the provinces within Siam, and the rules of lineage in the royal families.  But once into the film these constrictions relax and the development of the story is fascinating to watch.The costumes and scenery are as beautiful as any in comparative Asian films and the photography encourages the viewer to jump into the middle of the many gory battles and absorb the feeling of terror that is a running constant in this legend. Thankfully for a change the emphasis is not on highly choreographed fight sequences that crowd the screens today.  The acting is difficult to access: this lengthy two and a half hour version of the original four hour film treats some characters a bit abruptly, not allowing us to see how character evolvement worked in the original.  But the leads are beautiful and sensitive actors and given the scope of the film, each seems to handle the story well.There is an odd superimposition of Western music (of the tacky Muzak, elevator sort) on this otherwise authentic appearing  film.  I suppose that is due in part to the fact that Francis Ford Coppola is the producer and felt that the music would enhance Western viewing.  This would be a mute point if it were not for the fact that one of the most sensitive moments in this movie is when a young man is asked to sing for the king: the song is true Siamese not only in language but in notes and style and it is hauntingly beautiful!Due to the film's length and its indulgent use of battle bloody sequences this may not be a movie for everyone, but for those who find the history of the Orient sadly lacking in our teaching, then THE LEGEND OF SURIYOTHAI is a marvelous starting point.

The colors, the costumes, the bloodthirsty ambition, and the elephants!  What amazing images are these.  I was particulary enthralled with the scenes of elephant warfare and the one with the elegent river canoes thrusting into battle.  And the one-eyed warrior was over the top!  Even Hollywood should recognize that guy's talent.  How tough was he?For me, the only reason to not buy this right away is the hope that the longer Thai theatrical version (+45 minutes) might be even better.  But I doubt its coming out any time soon, and often editing is done for a good reason (see Das Boot or Blade Runner).

The first is Suriyothai, a princess who is in love with a fine man but is forced to marry Prince Tienne. The prince is a honey to look at it but really needs a good kick in the pants because he lacks the slightest bit of ambition or fighting spirit. Still, she makes the best of it. Her first love, Lord Piren also makes the best of it and carves out a succesfufl militray career.The other woman is the King's consort. She's angelic to look at but is cruel and will do whatever it takes to have her own way. She falls in love with the ancient Thai equivalent of a knight and decides to make him king. She has three innocent men killed because they unwittingly stand in the way of her affair. She kills the king, several hapless servants and procedes to try to wipe out the entire royal family.All along, Suriyothai sees what's up and battles to save her husband, children and country. There isn't room in the country for the two of them and one is going to have to die.The movie is very violent in an operatic sort of way. Everybody in the movie loves, hates, fights, eats and forgives in a huge way. The good are very good and the bad are very bad. The actress playing the High Consort's henchwoman was particularly distrubing. Oh and it features a massive battle on elephants and the one of the most beautifully filmed death scenes I've ever seen.

777773,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B0000DBJ2D,Ping Lim,"[7, 8]","This movie justifies to the world that Asian countries can make movies as good as or even better than Hollywood.  It's quite a rarity to have a movie made by a Prince, financed or endorsed by a Queen and the main character is acted by a royalty!  You would get to see all of that in the behind the scene segment that comes as extras in the DVD package.  Just like any other countries that were growing up, there were wild ambitions by various factions to reign the kingdom at any cost; the betrayal, the scheming, the plotting to hedge the bet or to better the chance; and to counter that, there were showing of honour, loyalty, bravery in times of need to do what the country is expected of you.  Suriyothai, in this instance, is portrayed as such.  She forsaked her true love for her distant cousin to marry a Prince just to keep the fragile peace among warring factions (which were related as well too).  With the death of the King, Suriyothai's brother-in-law decided to reign the nation even though he swore upon his father's death bed that he would support his nephew (who was only a mere toddler).  To do so, that involved a lot of killing naturally.  Suriyothai explained to her disgruntled husband that at times, the coup was necessary for the betterment of a nation (wise instead of conniving like Lady Macbeth).  As karma would have it, the brother-in-law would suffer a painful death as his own wife had an hidden agenda (to have her lover be coronated as a King & to have her long forgotten U Thong Dynasty be glorious once more).  Suriyothai's husband was projected as a peaceful ruler.  Rather than getting involved with all the bickering that was happening, he retreated to the temple instead (to his detriment as he would later found out as the Queen spread the rumour that Suriyothai's husband plotted for his own brother's downfall so he could be King himself).  Naturally, Suriyothai would summon for his distant cousin that she was in love with years ago to come to the rescue (Lord Piren).  Once all the introduction was gotten over and done with, the movie went up a notch to undo the plotters.  The Director explained that originally, CGI was meant to be done by the Industrial Light Magic but he found out that it was cheaper to be done in real time.  Thus, a fortunate accident that the fighting scenes were akin to Cecil de Mille's grand epic fighting.  Just to complicate the matter, Burma decided to get itself tangled in the civil war.  Here, we gotten to see the Spanish and the Portuguese that introduced modern weaponary and mercenaries to the warring factions and did I mention chicken pox as well?  To cut the story short, Suriyothai's death in the battlefield vented the anger of their fellow countrymen and women who would continue her fight for the freedom of her nation.  A very touching and well-deserving finale.  I haven't seen the extended version before but suffice to say that Francis Ford Coppola would have edited the unneeded scenes or as the Director said himself, Director indulging scenes to make the movie flows more smoothly or more rhythmically.  The deleted scenes were shown but not explained.  It's quite wonderful to note that the person who played Suriyothai's nemesis was akin to Madonna (pop singer) in Thailand, or shall I say, a sex symbol there.  In other words, she's perfectly casted as the conniving Queen who would use her sexuality to get her ways.  Suriyothai was mentioned quite a bit in the beginning and again in the end, but towards the middle, the movie focused more about the turbulent time that Thailand immersed itself in.  A sumptuous set, royal protocol which was followed quite strictly & possibly accurately as it's done by a Prince Director, fighting scenes with elephants which were never going to be outdone by, political backstabbing and intrigue that could match Elizabeth, a bit of love interest, this movie has got it all.  Overall, a very commendable effort especially when you think that this is an Asian but not Hollywood movie.

Directed by a Prince and presented by the Master Francis Ford Coppola, this movie is simply extravagant.  In many ways the grandeur presented here mirrors that found in RAN by Kirosawa.  This extraordinary tale is of a woman who becomes queen of Thailand due to a series of palace coups and machinations that lands her pious monk husband at the throne and sends her boyhood friend Prince Piren into battle against the invading Burmese army. Full of epic battle scenes, beautiful palaces and extraordinary scenes of Asian tranquility this film conjures up a culture and a time long gone.  From swashbuckling Portuguese mercenaries to stampeding armies mounted atop elephants no expense was spared. The deleted scenes lend to the grandeur.Yet several issues remain that take away from this films greatness and call into question the many awards it has received.  First the film should have been twice as long.  It is an epic and the stories and the characters deserve far more developing.  This leads to the second problem, which is the documentary like feeling you get since the characters don't have time to be developed much of the film has to be walked through by a narrator and every scene has to be presaged by the ever present name of the place you are viewing.  Had the film gone on for four hours one would have become used to the different palaces and cities, but due to its choppy nature one feels like they are watching something less then cinematic.  But regardless of these subtle issues, this film is a winner.Seth J.

I'll admit that it was hard at times to keep the names and places straight, but the plot is interesting, complex, and it all really happened. The costumes were catchy (should be nominated for an acadamy award), the setting was realsitic, the film quality is excellent, it was shot well, the script is appropriate, the battle scenes were exciting (cannons on elephant backs!)and the acting was decent. Admitedly, this will not appeal to everyone, as it is slower-paced.
