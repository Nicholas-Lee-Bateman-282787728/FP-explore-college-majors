927880,A1HLXZAJVAWLQ1,B000ALNO5W,"Carol E. Miller ""christmas carol""","[1, 1]","This is a beautiful film.  Of all the characters Johnny Depp has played so far, his portrayal of Raphael touched me the most.  The story is both poignant and heart-wrenching.  Johnny plays Raphael with dignity and does not use the usual white-man's idea of what a Native American is like.  I have watched this film several times and always feel that I have watched something truly special.  Marlon Brando makes a brief but essential appearance in the movie and I always admired Floyd ""Red Crow"" Westerman who plays Raphael's father.  It is a very welcome and very much enjoyed addition to my Johnny Depp dvd collection.",5,The Brave,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,619,"['beautiful', 'film', 'characters', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'played', 'so', 'far', 'portrayal', 'Raphael', 'touched', 'most', 'story', 'poignant', 'heart-wrenching', 'Johnny', 'Raphael', 'dignity', 'not', 'use', 'usual', 'white-man', 'idea', 'what', 'Native', 'American', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'always', 'feel', 'have', 'watched', 'something', 'truly', 'special', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'brief', 'essential', 'appearance', 'movie', 'always', 'admired', 'Floyd', 'Red', 'Crow', 'Westerman', 'who', 'Raphael', 'father', 'very', 'welcome', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'addition', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'dvd', 'collection']",N/A

What I mean is that I'm constantly aware that I'm watching a movie. This was a movie where I was able to loose myself in the story. I felt like I was really watching a man taking a desperate measure to save his family. In the film, Depp's character makes a deal to sell himself to some men who want to make him the star of their Snuff film. I felt myself being able to wonder what such a situation would be like as I watched Depp playing the character and I found myself actually hoping he would find a way out of his situation. Whether he got out of it or not I will not say as to do so would ruin the movie to an extent. WIth all the garbage that Hollywood produces it's a shame that a great film like this isn't released in the states. When I bought The Brave it came with another Depp movie called the PIANO II as part of a two pack. For me pursonally, the PIANO II was one of the biggest peices of crap I've seen in awhile but I got both movies for a price that I would have gladly paid for THE BRAVE DVD by itself.",5,THE BRAVE is one of Depp's best movies.,1165881600,"12 12, 2006",2006,1121,"['days', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'unable', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'get', 'story', 'What', 'mean', ""'m"", 'constantly', 'aware', ""'m"", 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'movie', 'where', 'was', 'able', 'loose', 'story', 'felt', 'was', 'really', 'watching', 'man', 'taking', 'desperate', 'measure', 'save', 'family', 'film', 'Depp', 'character', 'deal', 'sell', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'make', 'star', 'Snuff', 'film', 'felt', 'being', 'able', 'wonder', 'what', 'situation', 'would', 'be', 'watched', 'Depp', 'playing', 'character', 'found', 'actually', 'hoping', 'would', 'find', 'way', 'situation', 'got', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'ruin', 'movie', 'extent', 'WIth', 'garbage', 'Hollywood', 'shame', 'great', 'film', ""n't"", 'released', 'states', 'When', 'bought', 'Brave', 'came', 'Depp', 'movie', 'called', 'PIANO', 'II', 'part', 'two', 'pack', 'pursonally', 'PIANO', 'II', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'peices', 'crap', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'got', 'movies', 'price', 'would', 'have', 'gladly', 'paid', 'THE', 'BRAVE', 'DVD']",N/A

Sorry folks, Johnny can't direct. At least not direct and act at the same time. Maybe if he'd done one or the other it would have been better but it just plain sucked. I want to kill myself when I say that because Johnny can do no wrong in my eyes and I'm glad he got to try it but he is an actor. The best. He can't direct. Very important to see Brando though. His last(?)performance, and as usual fantastic-favor for a friend. I spent two years wishing Johnny would redo this movie and re-release it. Now I've decided he just needs to forget it and never try that again. Besides that I found the portrayal of Native American life almost offensive. I've lived among them for most of my life and I didn't think he captured anythng really about them except maybe the dad splurging on his kids. But there are no Indians living in garbage dumps. That's for sure. And as for tract houses, they can all get one.
