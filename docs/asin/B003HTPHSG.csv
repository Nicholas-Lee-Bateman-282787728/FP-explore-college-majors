The degree to which this guy's life is accident-ridden is what gets you chuckling in a few places, though it wasn't as funny as some I've seen in this genre.  For a much funnier black comedy around seriously dysfunctional families, it's hard to beat Almodovar's very twisted but touchingly hilarious ""What Have I Done To Deserve This"".  All the same, ""Accidents Happen"" is a fairly well-made picture with good performances all around, not least of which is given by the main star Harrison Gilbertson who puts in a great turn as Billy.

My favorite film of hers is ""Thelma and Louise"" because of the suspense, quirkiness, how the film builds into a scenario that was never meant ""to be,"" and how events in life turn into things we cannot possibly predict or envision in the long-term. Although only a movie, it was depicting just how crazy things in our lives can become. ""Accidents Happen"" is one I recommend although I haven't seen it yet! (I will soon...). I did read about the movie closely beforehand, which is why I purchased it. I feel sure it will be well worth watching and I look forward to it.

The movie focuses first and foremost on a young kid named Billy who battles with rebellion, growing up and trying to avoid making the wrong decisions with no luck.  His Mother is played exceptionally by Geena Davis who is truly the rock holding this little sleeper movie together.  It's great to see her working in a movie again since 2002, but if only it were a big blockbuster hit.  Watching this you remember why she is considered one of the greats.  This is by far no blockbuster, but a movie about people and their difficult lives.  It's not totally dreary and nor is it a comedy.

1345954,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B003HTPHSG,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","It is so good to finally see Geena Davis back on the big screen! Davis has always been one of my favorite actresses, showing a quick wit and a calm demeanor that has led to some tremendous films. In the new direct-to-video dramedy, Accidents Happen, she proves that she may have been on vacation for a while, but she hasn't lost a thing. In this film, Davis plays the mother of sixteen year old Billy Conway, (Harrison Gilbertson), who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The film starts with a childhood accident that destroys his family and really defines just who Billy is. After a chilling, but hilarious opening, the film jumps to a sixteen year old Billy and what's left of his family. His mother is crazy, his brother's a drunk, and his father just isn't around anymore, so it's up to Billy to deal with the trials and tribulations of a boy who is growing into a man. Davis is listed as the star and she has some amazingly funny lines, but the story is really centered around newcomer Harrison Gilbertson, who gives one the best performances by a teen actor that I've seen all year. Gilbertson very clearly shows us how Billy is seeming unaffected by what happens to him, he's strong, and seemingly ready to deal with anything, but on the inside, Billy is much different than he appears. The character was a deep one with many levels and Gilbertson takes us through them all with ease. I loved this film, because while it's dark and depressing at times, they also joke about these things that you're not supposed to joke about. Just when things seemingly become to much, that humor creeps back in and makes you love how wickedly fun this film is. If you want to see something different, that will have you going back and fourth between laughter and tears, then this is the film for you. I went into this film expecting nothing, just looking forward to seeing Geena Davis again and what I got instead was one of the best movies I've seen all year.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,1974,"['so', 'good', 'finally', 'see', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'back', 'big', 'screen', 'Davis', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'showing', 'quick', 'wit', 'calm', 'demeanor', 'led', 'tremendous', 'films', 'new', 'direct-to-video', 'dramedy', 'Accidents', 'Happen', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'vacation', 'while', ""n't"", 'lost', 'thing', 'film', 'Davis', 'mother', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Billy', 'Conway', 'Harrison', 'Gilbertson', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'film', 'childhood', 'accident', 'family', 'really', 'defines', 'just', 'who', 'Billy', 'chilling', 'hilarious', 'opening', 'film', 'jumps', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Billy', 'what', 'left', 'family', 'mother', 'crazy', 'brother', 'drunk', 'father', 'just', ""n't"", 'around', 'anymore', 'up', 'Billy', 'deal', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'boy', 'who', 'growing', 'man', 'Davis', 'listed', 'star', 'amazingly', 'funny', 'lines', 'story', 'really', 'centered', 'newcomer', 'Harrison', 'Gilbertson', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'teen', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Gilbertson', 'very', 'clearly', 'how', 'Billy', 'seeming', 'unaffected', 'what', 'strong', 'seemingly', 'ready', 'deal', 'anything', 'inside', 'Billy', 'much', 'different', 'character', 'was', 'deep', 'one', 'many', 'levels', 'Gilbertson', 'ease', 'loved', 'film', 'dark', 'depressing', 'times', 'also', 'joke', 'things', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'joke', 'about', 'Just', 'when', 'things', 'seemingly', 'become', 'much', 'humor', 'creeps', 'back', 'love', 'how', 'wickedly', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'different', 'will', 'have', 'going', 'back', 'fourth', 'laughter', 'tears', 'then', 'film', 'went', 'film', 'expecting', 'nothing', 'just', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'again', 'what', 'got', 'instead', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year']",N/A
