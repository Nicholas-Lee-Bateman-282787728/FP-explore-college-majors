Why?  Well there's a number of reasons so what's say that we get into them.First off the Animation:The animation was done by a studio called &#34;A-1 Pictures&#34; whom did the animation for &#34;Black Butler&#34; ,&#34;Blue Exorcist&#34; ,&#34;Sword Art Online&#34; of course this series.  There are plenty of other series' that they have done the animation for but those are jut some of them and yes I will be reviewing both seasons of Black Butler that are currently available.The animation in this season (and the season after) is honestly some of the best that I have seen in a good many years.  I've been watching Anime since Sailor Moon in 1997 and I kept wondering what it would look like years later.  Well this studio along with &#34;Studio DEEN&#34; have definitely ramped up the attention to detail that much is for sure and it definitely raises the bar for me as to what I expect to see in my Animes for years to come.Now let's get on with the story:The story starts based around Haruka Nanami whom dreams of one day becoming a top composer in Japan.  To accomplish this she ends trying to get into the Saotome Academy along with her friend Tomochika (we'll be calling her &#34;Tomo&#34; for the rest of this review) but you see she appeared to be late for the exam and wouldn't be allowed to get into the school to take the entrance exam!Enter Ittoki Otoya and Ren Jinguji with the former appearing at the gate to try and help her get into the school to take the test and the latter entering by Limo explaining the reason WHY she was late in the first place.  Despite this the security wouldn't allow her in until one phone call took care of that and the rest as they say...is history!The story through these 13 episodes takes the viewer on a roller coaster of emotions both with the highs and lows that make this season (and series as a whole) special.  There is enough comedy watching this series as the students she encounters have to resist asking her out because the school has a strict &#34;No Love&#34; policy which makes some of the interactions that happen throughout quite amusing to watch.  As a viewer you feel bad because you KNOW that the students she meets want to date her but they can't due to the rule in place there.Oh but its also not without the typical story at the start when students believe she only got in because of &#34;favors&#34; or whatnot.  This story quickly gets dropped however within the first three episodes while we find out that Haruka can play the piano somewhat but reading the actually music...not so much (this is the cause of the talk from the other students)You also find out that one of the students in the school is secretly leading a double life.  When I saw this story my first thought was Endo Kazuki from Gakuen Heaven (one of my first reviews on this site actually) when he lead the double life of student and Chairman.  In THIS case it has to do with a student going to school learning to BE an Idol when they already ARE one (and also became the motivation for Haruka to even WANT to go to Saotome in the first place).The way the story builds up is that the first few episodes are used to introduce each character separately with some kind of pairing or &#34;issue&#34;.  You got Ittoki and Ichinose ,Masato and Ren and Syo and Natsuki (although Nats houses a &#34;third&#34; person that you do NOT want to meet!) and each of the episodes essentially helps you learn about each of the characters and the fact that they have one singular motivation to have Haruka write songs for them.As with any Anime you need solid characters and this series has them as I have mentioned throughout so far.  From Otoya to Tokiya everyone of them is very much a likable character while you have to try and get used to Saotome and Ringo....the less I say about him the better off I am.The music is also a joy to listen to especially the OP (&#34;Orpheus&#34;) and the ED for this season (&#34;Maji Love 1000%&#34;) as those songs make you want to watch the next episode.  That sounds weird to say but sometimes after the song plays from a series I kind of just want to stop watching for a little while (and yes that's happened to me in the past).Want to know the BEST song in the season?  &#34;Mirai Chizu&#34;!Why?I'm not telling :-pSeriously the reason that song became a favorite of mine you have to see the episode it comes in because its one of those moments that if you were kind of &#34;meh&#34; on the series before the final episode of Series 1 then you are in for a treat come the end of it I promiseIf you aren't watching Uta no Prince-Sama then I actually feel bad for you because its one of those Animes that NEEDS to be watched and appreciated as one of the best out there at this point in time!take care",5,An all-around package for Anime fans,1392508800,"02

1671725,AJ1HZBMZSRJ34,B00FJX96U8,CayleyAlaina,"[0, 2]","This is undoubtedly my favorite anime of all time. If you are a fan of reverse-harem animes, you need to stop reading my review and  purchase this RIGHT NOW.Uta No Prince Sama 1000% is based around Nanami Haruka, a teenager who desperately wants to become the next composer for her favorite pop-star idol HAYATO. When she joins Saotome Academy, a school for upcoming idols and composers, she meets six boys that will change her life forever.The animation is a very big factor for me when it comes to if I will watch the anime or not. I am a big fan of clean and precise animation with bright colors and lots of flow. I can easily say that this show has some of the best animation I have ever seen in anime. The characters are styled just right: the girls are very cute with brightly colored hair and the guys are not too feminine looking, as I have found to be the case in other romance and reverse-harem animes. Every character has their own little quirks and differences as well, which was really enjoyable to watch unfold throughout the episodes of this first season.I am usually not a fan of music-centered, well, anything. I loathe musical movies unless they are animated (and even then they aren't really my cup of tea). But I will say that the music in this show is absolutely great. Since there are six different characters that are striving to become pop-idols, we get to hear them many times in unison, and many times singing solo. The voice actors were picked stupendously for the roles of these six boys, and all of their voices are absolutely beautiful. Most of the songs they sing are quite catchy, especially the theme song, but you will find that the lyrics are pretty generic. They sing about nothing but how &#34;my love for you is like a sparkling rainbow stretching over fields of beautiful roses.&#34; ...yeah. And thats not even an exaggeration.Uta No Prince Sama 1000% Season 1 is a musical journey of romance and humor.
