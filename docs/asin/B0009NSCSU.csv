908697,A1LQM8HGS94BFV,B0009NSCSU,"Foistie ""Foistie""","[28, 28]","Pros:The 2 1/2+ hour 'History' of the Steelers is an engaging, top-notch look at both the good and the bad times for the Steelers franchise.  Humorous, introspective, and informative, especially during the pre-dynasty days for the Steelers.The 'profile' segment on Franco Harris and ""Franco's Italian Army"" is very nostalgic, moving, and makes you remember what was good about 70's.  Thoroughly enjoyable.The 'profile' on Terry Bradshaw became sappy at times, but still presented a well rounded view of his estrangement and ultimate reunion with the Steeler fans, the city, the team, and Chuck Noll.  It could have better presented his strong playing ability, especially during the end of his career.  This profile also seemed somewhat 'vindictive' showing Terry as still missing the 'T' in cat.  Still a good profile.Cons:Certainly falls well short of the 'Complete History of the Steelers.'  I would have liked to have seen at least 10+ more 'profiles' on various players/personalities including Ham, Lambert, Rooney Sr. & Jr., Blount, Mean Joe, Swann, Stallworth, Woodson, many of the pre-70's players, and many many more stars that can be named by you or me.Only one of the four superbowls are included.  Sounds to me like they are planning on three more 'Complete History' DVDS...Also I would have liked to have had an 'uncut' version of Superbowl XIII, and not just the 'edited' version included here.  This version is more of a 'Highlights' version along with player interviews.  Nice, but where's the uncut original?As the title of this review says, it's light on total content.  Still well worth buying, but don't expect anything more than ""The Completely Edited History of the Steelers.""

908699,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0009NSCSU,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[38, 42]","The Steelers - The Complete History DVD contains two discs.  On the first disc the audience can discover the history of the Steelers in a rather interesting documentary.  Through this almost two and half-hour long documentary historical facts emerge, as well as what rests behind the winning tradition of the Steelers.""Here we go, Steelers, here we go!""Steelers' tradition is built on perseverance, toughness, and unity, which began in the midst of the Great Depression when Arthur Rooney bought his team into the National Football League.  It was back in 1933 when Rooney paid the sum of $2,500 to be a part of the NFL and at that time the team was called the Pirates.  The merger with Rooney's team and the NFL was a struggle, as the team did not achieve a winning season with the name Pirates.  Two years after their name change from Pirates to Steelers in 1940 they harvested their first winning season.  However, the foundation was in position, as they gained the tradition of persevere in a time of great difficulty.In the 1950 and 60s the Steelers stepped up their game, even though the wins were few, as all opponents knew the team for its brutal toughness.  This toughness truly emerged in the 1970s when the team's defensive line acquired the nickname the Steel Curtain.  The Steel Curtain led by Mean Joe Green helped together with several other defensive players such as Jack Lambert, Ernie Holmes, and Dwight ""Mad Dog"" White to the Steelers first two Superbowl victories.Some years later still in the 1970s, the NFL decided to change the rules due to the Steelers defensive superiority and the low scoring games.  The change brought a more open field, which made it easier to pass to the wide receivers.  A team with Terry Bradshaw at quarterback and the two deep threat wide receivers Lynn Swan and John Stallworth opened up offense for the Steelers who continued to remain tough on the football field.  They won their last Superbowl in 1980 against the Los Angeles Rams.Although it might sound that the tough 1970s Steelers won the first two with defense and the second two with offense, it should be known that the teammates of the Steelers have always carried each other through rough and tough times, as Mean Joe Green gave his support to the Bradshaw when the confidence in him was at an all time low.  The unselfish act by Green is a commendable example of the Steelers tradition, which has unified a whole city to stand behind their yellow and black football players through any kind of adversity.  The Steelers traditions and attitudes of perseverance, toughness, and unity are still fostered by current head coach Bill Cowher.Steelers - The Complete History comes in a stylish packaging that Steelers fans will enjoy.  The material on the two discs is definitely interesting and worth viewing for football fans and enthusiasts.  However, the audience should be aware of the poor quality of the image, which unfortunately stains the quality of the DVD.",5,"""Here we go, Steelers, here we go!""",1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,2974,"['Steelers', 'Complete', 'History', 'DVD', 'two', 'discs', 'first', 'audience', 'can', 'discover', 'history', 'Steelers', 'rather', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'almost', 'two', 'half-hour', 'long', 'documentary', 'historical', 'facts', 'emerge', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'winning', 'tradition', 'Steelers', 'Here', 'go', 'Steelers', 'here', 'go', 'Steelers', 'tradition', 'built', 'perseverance', 'toughness', 'unity', 'began', 'midst', 'Great', 'Depression', 'when', 'Arthur', 'Rooney', 'bought', 'team', 'National', 'Football', 'League', 'was', 'back', '1933', 'when', 'Rooney', 'paid', 'sum', '2,500', 'be', 'part', 'NFL', 'time', 'team', 'was', 'called', 'Pirates', 'merger', 'Rooney', 'team', 'NFL', 'was', 'struggle', 'team', 'did', 'not', 'achieve', 'winning', 'season', 'name', 'Pirates', 'Two', 'years', 'name', 'change', 'Pirates', 'Steelers', '1940', 'harvested', 'first', 'winning', 'season', 'However', 'foundation', 'was', 'position', 'gained', 'tradition', 'persevere', 'time', 'great', 'difficulty.In', '1950', '60s', 'Steelers', 'stepped', 'up', 'game', 'even', 'wins', 'were', 'few', 'opponents', 'knew', 'team', 'brutal', 'toughness', 'toughness', 'truly', 'emerged', '1970s', 'when', 'team', 'defensive', 'line', 'acquired', 'nickname', 'Steel', 'Curtain', 'Steel', 'Curtain', 'led', 'Mean', 'Joe', 'Green', 'helped', 'together', 'several', 'other', 'defensive', 'players', 'such', 'Jack', 'Lambert', 'Ernie', 'Holmes', 'Dwight', 'Mad', 'Dog', 'White', 'Steelers', 'first', 'two', 'Superbowl', 'victories.Some', 'years', 'later', 'still', '1970s', 'NFL', 'decided', 'change', 'rules', 'due', 'Steelers', 'defensive', 'superiority', 'low', 'scoring', 'games', 'change', 'brought', 'more', 'open', 'field', 'made', 'easier', 'pass', 'wide', 'receivers', 'team', 'Terry', 'Bradshaw', 'quarterback', 'two', 'deep', 'threat', 'wide', 'receivers', 'Lynn', 'Swan', 'John', 'Stallworth', 'opened', 'up', 'offense', 'Steelers', 'who', 'continued', 'remain', 'tough', 'football', 'field', 'won', 'last', 'Superbowl', '1980', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Rams.Although', 'might', 'sound', 'tough', '1970s', 'Steelers', 'won', 'first', 'two', 'defense', 'second', 'two', 'offense', 'should', 'be', 'known', 'teammates', 'Steelers', 'have', 'always', 'carried', 'other', 'rough', 'tough', 'times', 'Mean', 'Joe', 'Green', 'gave', 'support', 'Bradshaw', 'when', 'confidence', 'was', 'time', 'low', 'unselfish', 'act', 'Green', 'commendable', 'example', 'Steelers', 'tradition', 'unified', 'whole', 'city', 'stand', 'yellow', 'black', 'football', 'players', 'kind', 'adversity', 'Steelers', 'traditions', 'attitudes', 'perseverance', 'toughness', 'unity', 'are', 'still', 'fostered', 'current', 'head', 'coach', 'Bill', 'Cowher.Steelers', 'Complete', 'History', 'stylish', 'packaging', 'Steelers', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'material', 'two', 'discs', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'worth', 'viewing', 'football', 'fans', 'enthusiasts', 'However', 'audience', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'poor', 'quality', 'image', 'unfortunately', 'quality', 'DVD']",Pittsburgh Steelers: The Complete History
