986687,ARCZ2LAOX362F,B000FA57KI,Emilio Iodice,"[4, 4]","A Kid From Philadelphia,: Mario Lanza: The Voice of the PoetsDocumentaries about Mario Lanza have been made that are better than this, yet this film is useful and made for fans like me.Mario Lanza was the most versatile tenor who ever walked on a stage. He could sing opera like the greatest tenors of all time. He was a master at ""crossing over"" from lyric opera to popular singing. As a result, he was a top recording artist and concert performer. In the ""Great Caruso"" he also showed he could be a global movie sensation. The movie about the amazing Neapolitan tenor actually was about Mario Lanza. It turned the Great Caruso into the Great Lanza. He exhibited all of his splendid qualities.The movie inspired me to write my recent book about Mario Lanza: ""A Kid from Philadelphia, Mario Lanza, the Voice of the Poets."" It is not a biography. There have been several excellent bios about him. This is a book from a fan. It exhibits his qualities, talents, passion and love for his art. I wanted it to be a ""page turner"" that would be impossible to put down while listening to the magnificent voice of Mario Lanza.Anyone who loves Lanza the movie star, the tenor, the popular singer and the human being who did so much in such a short time will like this film.",3,See it if You Love Mario Lanza,1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,1262,"['Kid', 'From', 'Philadelphia', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'Voice', 'PoetsDocumentaries', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'are', 'better', 'yet', 'film', 'useful', 'made', 'fans', 'me.Mario', 'Lanza', 'was', 'most', 'versatile', 'tenor', 'who', 'ever', 'walked', 'stage', 'could', 'sing', 'opera', 'greatest', 'tenors', 'time', 'was', 'master', 'crossing', 'over', 'lyric', 'opera', 'popular', 'singing', 'result', 'was', 'top', 'recording', 'artist', 'concert', 'performer', 'Great', 'Caruso', 'also', 'showed', 'could', 'be', 'global', 'movie', 'sensation', 'movie', 'amazing', 'Neapolitan', 'tenor', 'actually', 'was', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'turned', 'Great', 'Caruso', 'Great', 'Lanza', 'exhibited', 'splendid', 'qualities.The', 'movie', 'inspired', 'write', 'recent', 'book', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'Kid', 'Philadelphia', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'Voice', 'Poets', 'not', 'biography', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'excellent', 'bios', 'book', 'fan', 'qualities', 'talents', 'passion', 'love', 'art', 'wanted', 'be', 'page', 'turner', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'put', 'down', 'listening', 'magnificent', 'voice', 'Mario', 'Lanza.Anyone', 'who', 'Lanza', 'movie', 'star', 'tenor', 'popular', 'singer', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'will', 'like', 'film']",N/A

He sang many songs in English to we could hear the quality of his voice and understand what he was singing about. His heart/emotions shown through on so many of his music....... it made his talent available to non-opera type people........... His voice still gives me chills. No other Tenor has done what he did.
