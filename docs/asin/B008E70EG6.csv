1551166,A2582KMXLK2P06,B008E70EG6,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","While it's totally understandable that most reviewers would have negative feelings with Barricade, and don't get me wrong many of those reasons are completely fair, I can't help but ignore all the problems and flaws and focus on the one thing Barricade succeeds at- being scary and unpredictable, two crucial elements of horror movies.  Seriously, there's nothing worse than a horror movie where you can predict every moment of the storytelling.While watching Barricade, let's be honest, practically nothing will make a bit of sense.  It's about a single father who takes his young daughter and son to a log cabin out in the woods in the middle of a snowstorm.  At first you'll think you're watching a below average horror film with predictable writing and may even consider turning it over, however I think you should keep watching because as soon as the family arrives to the house, INCREDIBLY weird things begin to happen.  I'm not sure what everyone else was thinking the entire time, but I was convinced the father was going through some kind of panic/anxiety attacks, dizzy spells and hallucinating like a madman.  This is especially apparent whenever he starts drinking and reaches for pills in the medicine cabinet.Basically the movie goes from one panic attack-like bit of storytelling directly into another without missing a single beat.  It can be overwhelming the way the movie just *pours* a neverending parade of heart-pounding horror elements at you despite hardly ever making sense, but it honestly works.  It effectively creates a feeling of anxiety for the viewers, which is why I'm not hesitating for a single moment to give the film a 4-star rating.Of course the problem here is that nobody can really *explain* what's occurring on screen.  One moment the father doesn't know what time of day it is and questions his kids when they tell him it's nighttime, the next he's locking his kids inside a room and nailing it shut because apparently there's some kind of powerful danger looming outside (or in the house) so he wants to protect his family.  To add more to the confusion, we occasionally see shadow figures standing outside in the snow.  I don't know what to make of this particular one.  The part where the daughter is kneeling down and eating macaroni and cheese on the kitchen floor is *awesome!*  You'll see why when you watch it.  THAT'S what nightmares are made of my friends!The mother/wife is deceased, and perhaps this is the one really lackluster moment of storytelling due to some *horrendous* acting when she hits her head on the side of the kitchen counter and dies.  If we ignore this one horrible moment of acting however, we're left with a pretty satisfying horror movie I believe.  Luckily the mother/wife barely appears in the movie with the exception of a few segments near the beginning and later at the end.However, the good news is that by the movies conclusion, we have logical answers!  Well one thing is logical.  I won't spoil what happens, but let's just say, the old man at the convenience store isn't nearly as innocent as he seems (not that I thought he was- hey he looked suspicious in an admittedly cliched way right from the get go).Anyway I like the frantic/nervous approach of the atmosphere and writing.  Even the kids are pretty good actors too, which is rare in television nowadays.  Usually they just throw kids on screen because they're cute enough for the part.  Not so in Barricade.  At only 75 minutes, it provides better scares than most of the acclaimed horror movies out there.  This is an example of a movie where the uncertainty of the events taking place actually adds *more* to the suspense.  You can follow this movie in that you know something really bizarre is going on- but can you guess what's going to happen at the end?  That ending is crucial.  Highly underrated.",4,let me out!,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,3847,"['totally', 'understandable', 'most', 'reviewers', 'would', 'have', 'negative', 'feelings', 'Barricade', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'many', 'reasons', 'are', 'completely', 'fair', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'ignore', 'problems', 'flaws', 'focus', 'one', 'thing', 'Barricade', 'at-', 'being', 'scary', 'unpredictable', 'two', 'crucial', 'elements', 'horror', 'movies', 'Seriously', 'nothing', 'worse', 'horror', 'movie', 'where', 'can', 'predict', 'moment', 'storytelling.While', 'watching', 'Barricade', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'practically', 'nothing', 'will', 'make', 'bit', 'sense', 'single', 'father', 'who', 'young', 'daughter', 'son', 'log', 'cabin', 'woods', 'middle', 'snowstorm', 'first', ""'ll"", 'think', ""'re"", 'watching', 'below', 'average', 'horror', 'film', 'predictable', 'writing', 'may', 'even', 'consider', 'turning', 'however', 'think', 'should', 'keep', 'watching', 'as', 'soon', 'family', 'house', 'INCREDIBLY', 'weird', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'thinking', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'convinced', 'father', 'was', 'going', 'kind', 'panic/anxiety', 'attacks', 'dizzy', 'spells', 'hallucinating', 'madman', 'especially', 'apparent', 'whenever', 'drinking', 'reaches', 'pills', 'medicine', 'cabinet.Basically', 'movie', 'one', 'panic', 'attack-like', 'bit', 'storytelling', 'directly', 'missing', 'single', 'beat', 'can', 'be', 'overwhelming', 'way', 'movie', 'just', '*pours*', 'neverending', 'parade', 'heart-pounding', 'horror', 'elements', 'hardly', 'ever', 'making', 'sense', 'honestly', 'effectively', 'feeling', 'anxiety', 'viewers', 'why', ""'m"", 'not', 'hesitating', 'single', 'moment', 'give', 'film', '4-star', 'rating.Of', 'course', 'problem', 'here', 'nobody', 'can', 'really', '*explain*', 'what', 'occurring', 'screen', 'One', 'moment', 'father', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'time', 'day', 'questions', 'kids', 'when', 'tell', 'nighttime', 'next', 'locking', 'kids', 'room', 'nailing', 'shut', 'because', 'apparently', 'kind', 'powerful', 'danger', 'looming', 'outside', 'house', 'protect', 'family', 'add', 'more', 'confusion', 'occasionally', 'see', 'shadow', 'figures', 'standing', 'outside', 'snow', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'particular', 'one', 'part', 'where', 'daughter', 'kneeling', 'down', 'eating', 'macaroni', 'cheese', 'kitchen', 'floor', '*awesome', '*', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'when', 'watch', 'what', 'nightmares', 'are', 'made', 'friends', 'mother/wife', 'deceased', 'perhaps', 'one', 'really', 'lackluster', 'moment', 'storytelling', 'due', '*horrendous*', 'acting', 'when', 'head', 'side', 'kitchen', 'counter', 'dies', 'ignore', 'one', 'horrible', 'moment', 'acting', 'however', ""'re"", 'left', 'pretty', 'satisfying', 'horror', 'movie', 'believe', 'Luckily', 'mother/wife', 'barely', 'movie', 'exception', 'few', 'segments', 'beginning', 'later', 'end.However', 'good', 'news', 'movies', 'conclusion', 'have', 'logical', 'answers', 'Well', 'one', 'thing', 'logical', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'what', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'old', 'man', 'convenience', 'store', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'innocent', 'not', 'thought', 'was-', 'hey', 'looked', 'suspicious', 'admittedly', 'cliched', 'way', 'right', 'get', 'go', '.Anyway', 'like', 'frantic/nervous', 'approach', 'atmosphere', 'writing', 'Even', 'kids', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'actors', 'too', 'rare', 'television', 'nowadays', 'Usually', 'just', 'throw', 'kids', 'screen', ""'re"", 'cute', 'enough', 'part', 'Not', 'so', 'Barricade', 'only', '75', 'minutes', 'better', 'scares', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'horror', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'example', 'movie', 'where', 'uncertainty', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'actually', '*more*', 'suspense', 'can', 'follow', 'movie', 'know', 'something', 'really', 'bizarre', 'going', 'on-', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'end', 'ending', 'crucial', 'Highly', 'underrated']",N/A

I'm tired of grabbing a movie because I think it's about monsters or demons, and it turns out SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT!!!!!To not be that at all. So for no reason at all this guy starts hallucinating about ghosts or demons or whatever, and it turns out he just has a virus he caught from an old man? The kids ain't dead, they just had fevers? This movie is like getting a DVD about shark attacks and at the end, the shark turned out to be some guys mother in law she's attacking his ability to take care of his family. But on the cover of the DVD it's a picture of a shark attacking people.And can we put the word out to ask all directors to stop doing the ""something walks by real fast through a window but we can't see what it is?""

Eric is taking his two kids Cynthia (Conner Dwelly) and Jake (Ryan Grantham) to an isolated cabin in the woods, the childhood getaway home of his now deceased wife, a cabin in the wintry woods where every horror film dwells. We are revealed details of her demise as a flashback, something they could have done better.I honestly didn't know where this was going, i.e. slasher, ghost etc. The events build slow and the next thing you know things are going on and you have no ideal what is real and what is not although the film does give clues. It turns out to be a decent mystery/horror film. I thought the title was clever as ""Barricade"" has a duo meaning as Eric has ""barricaded"" himself emotionally from his his children.When I first saw the WWE previews I did a double take as I thought I had purchased a film about a cage match.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.

Perhaps it's because this movie takes a bit of a turn that many didn't expect, myself included.If you prefer a lot of blood and gore, and a lot of violent action- this isn't for you. If you prefer everything to be explained immediately, again, not a good movie for you. This one requires some patience to see how it unwinds. The horror in this one is the unknown and the insane things that go on during their stay at the cabin. (and some 'cabin', btw...looks like a mansion to me!)It jumped around a bit, from the happenings in the cabin to flashbacks of life before his wife died to weird time warping that happens only to the main character. I found it all to be decently well done and it pulled together just fine at the end. Even without knowing the how/why of it all as it went along, I found it entertaining and wasn't completely lost, more interested in seeing what happened next.It WAS mostly explained in the end, in a somewhat-neat-but-not-all-laid-out fashion. There's just enough of a loose end to keep some suspense, but it didn't cut out with no plausible explanation. It worked for me, but seeing other reviews, it irritated others. To each their own, I suppose. I liked it.The acting was okay. Eric McCormack comes off a bit too glib at parts, and the dialogue felt a bit fake and strained at times. He does a good job in the non-verbal acting parts. Not stellar, not horrible, but good. The child actors were just okay, with the boy being far better than the girl, who I found a little too over-the-top at points.While this isn't one I'd watch again, as I know how it turns out and most of the fun in this one is the weird happenings coupled with the suspense, I though it was worth the rental.",4,Good pyschological horror/suspense- I don't understand all the bomb ratings,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,1784,"[""'m"", 'little', 'surprised', 'complaints', 'others', 'have', 'one', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'bit', 'turn', 'many', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'included.If', 'prefer', 'lot', 'blood', 'gore', 'lot', 'violent', 'action-', ""n't"", 'prefer', 'everything', 'be', 'explained', 'immediately', 'again', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'patience', 'see', 'how', 'horror', 'one', 'unknown', 'insane', 'things', 'go', 'stay', 'cabin', ""'cabin"", 'btw', 'mansion', 'jumped', 'bit', 'happenings', 'cabin', 'flashbacks', 'life', 'wife', 'died', 'weird', 'time', 'warping', 'only', 'main', 'character', 'found', 'be', 'decently', 'well', 'done', 'pulled', 'together', 'just', 'fine', 'end', 'Even', 'knowing', 'how/why', 'went', 'found', 'entertaining', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'lost', 'more', 'interested', 'seeing', 'what', 'happened', 'WAS', 'mostly', 'explained', 'end', 'somewhat-neat-but-not-all-laid-out', 'fashion', 'just', 'enough', 'loose', 'end', 'keep', 'suspense', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'out', 'plausible', 'explanation', 'worked', 'seeing', 'other', 'reviews', 'irritated', 'others', 'own', 'suppose', 'liked', 'it.The', 'acting', 'was', 'okay', 'Eric', 'McCormack', 'off', 'bit', 'too', 'glib', 'parts', 'dialogue', 'felt', 'bit', 'fake', 'strained', 'times', 'good', 'job', 'non-verbal', 'acting', 'parts', 'Not', 'stellar', 'not', 'horrible', 'good', 'child', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'okay', 'boy', 'being', 'far', 'better', 'girl', 'who', 'found', 'little', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'points.While', ""n't"", 'one', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'know', 'how', 'out', 'most', 'fun', 'one', 'weird', 'happenings', 'coupled', 'suspense', 'was', 'worth', 'rental']",N/A
