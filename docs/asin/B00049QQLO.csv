854993,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00049QQLO,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[3, 4]","I was looking forward to trying this video, as I was hoping that the weights would be used to enhance the yoga poses. Instead, this is more of a yoga practice with some toning work thrown in. Instructor Sara Ivanhoe begins the practice with a few brief stretches in a standing position then picks up the weights. She leads you through some standing shoulder work in mountain, tree, and chair poses and ends the segment in eagle pose, which I found a bit awkward with the weights. Next comes a warrior series where you hold your legs in the warrior position while working your arms with bicep curls and flies. Sara also does side angle pose, using the weights in sort of a one-arm row to an overhead lift, which I felt was a nice shoulder opener.Sara then moves to the floor with triceps/core balance work performed from a hands and knees position. Next comes bridge pose while ""bench pressing"" the weights; the second set is performed on one leg, which was particularly challenging. A few additional stretches bring the practice to an end right at 20 minutes. Throughout the practice, Sara uses 2-lb. weights; I used 3 lbs., which I felt were too heavy for some of the earlier shoulder moves yet too light for the biceps and triceps work. Sara's personality in this video is similar to her prior Crunch and Dummies videos: she is very down-to-earth, although some may find her language a bit patronizing at times. I don't think that this video would appeal to those who are devoted to a more traditional yoga practice, but if you are hoping to do some light strength work with yoga stretches thrown in, this routine might be right for you.",3,Add a toning aspect to your yoga practice,1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,1639,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'trying', 'video', 'was', 'hoping', 'weights', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'enhance', 'yoga', 'poses', 'Instead', 'more', 'yoga', 'practice', 'toning', 'work', 'thrown', 'Instructor', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'practice', 'few', 'brief', 'stretches', 'standing', 'position', 'then', 'up', 'weights', 'standing', 'shoulder', 'work', 'mountain', 'tree', 'chair', 'poses', 'segment', 'eagle', 'pose', 'found', 'bit', 'awkward', 'weights', 'Next', 'warrior', 'series', 'where', 'hold', 'legs', 'warrior', 'position', 'working', 'arms', 'bicep', 'curls', 'flies', 'Sara', 'also', 'side', 'pose', 'using', 'weights', 'sort', 'one-arm', 'row', 'overhead', 'lift', 'felt', 'was', 'nice', 'shoulder', 'opener.Sara', 'then', 'floor', 'triceps/core', 'balance', 'work', 'performed', 'hands', 'knees', 'position', 'Next', 'bridge', 'pose', 'bench', 'pressing', 'weights', 'second', 'set', 'performed', 'one', 'leg', 'was', 'particularly', 'challenging', 'few', 'additional', 'stretches', 'bring', 'practice', 'end', 'right', '20', 'minutes', 'practice', 'Sara', '2-lb', 'weights', 'used', '3', 'lbs.', 'felt', 'were', 'too', 'heavy', 'earlier', 'shoulder', 'moves', 'yet', 'too', 'light', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'work', 'Sara', 'personality', 'video', 'similar', 'prior', 'Crunch', 'Dummies', 'videos', 'very', 'down-to-earth', 'may', 'find', 'language', 'bit', 'patronizing', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'video', 'would', 'appeal', 'who', 'are', 'devoted', 'more', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'practice', 'are', 'hoping', 'do', 'light', 'strength', 'work', 'yoga', 'stretches', 'thrown', 'routine', 'might', 'be', 'right']",N/A

She's one of the few out there who can lead you through a pose while you're not looking at the screen. Sadly, this workout is just silly.  If you want to work out with weights, don't do it with yoga poses... it is the antithesis of yoga, and it feels awful.  Coming from someone (me) who works out with light weights, dances, and does pilates and yoga on a regular basis (changing it up daily to keep my body guessing, flexible and hopefully, fit) I found this workout nonsensical, and, sorry Sara, stupid.",1,Weights and Yoga?

In this 20-minute workout you will be working your upper and lower body simultaneously. The setting is gorgeous and Sara's outfit colors make the entire scene look like an escape into paradise. As waves break on the shore, Sara leads you through a program that not only tests your balance, it tests your creativity and she has an exercise for your triceps that will have you wondering why you did that exercise any other way.After years of exercising your muscles might get used to the same old exercises. With Sara's approach to yoga, you not only have challenging yoga poses to master; you can tone your upper body with weights.There is a brief introduction, a warm-up session and then yoga with weights. A short stretching session allows your body to cool down.Other features:Photo GalleryTrailers of additional workoutsHealth & Diet TipsYoga with Just MusicYou can also just listen to the music from the yoga with music workout and continue stretching after the 20 minutes. If this is too short, you can combine it with other Sara Ivanhoe 20 minute workouts. In fact, she recommends you combine the workouts for maximum results. Walking for 30 -45 minutes before this workout is my personal recommendation. The additional balance challenge with the weights made me truly love this new approach to yoga.Also highly recommended: Crunch Candlelight Yoga~The Rebecca Review",5,Two Workouts in One,1105833600,"01 16, 2005",2005,1498,"['Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'always', 'impressed', 'teaching', 'style', 'ability', 'present', 'creative', 'workouts', 'relaxing', 'setting', '20-minute', 'workout', 'will', 'be', 'working', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'simultaneously', 'setting', 'gorgeous', 'Sara', 'outfit', 'colors', 'make', 'entire', 'scene', 'look', 'escape', 'paradise', 'waves', 'break', 'shore', 'Sara', 'program', 'not', 'only', 'balance', 'creativity', 'exercise', 'triceps', 'will', 'have', 'wondering', 'why', 'did', 'exercise', 'other', 'way.After', 'years', 'exercising', 'muscles', 'might', 'get', 'used', 'same', 'old', 'exercises', 'Sara', 'approach', 'yoga', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'challenging', 'yoga', 'poses', 'master', 'can', 'tone', 'upper', 'body', 'weights.There', 'brief', 'introduction', 'warm-up', 'session', 'then', 'yoga', 'weights', 'short', 'stretching', 'session', 'body', 'cool', 'down.Other', 'features', 'Photo', 'GalleryTrailers', 'additional', 'workoutsHealth', 'Diet', 'TipsYoga', 'Just', 'MusicYou', 'can', 'also', 'just', 'listen', 'music', 'yoga', 'music', 'workout', 'continue', 'stretching', '20', 'minutes', 'too', 'short', 'can', 'combine', 'other', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', '20', 'minute', 'workouts', 'fact', 'combine', 'workouts', 'maximum', 'results', 'Walking', '30', '-45', 'minutes', 'workout', 'personal', 'recommendation', 'additional', 'balance', 'challenge', 'weights', 'made', 'truly', 'love', 'new', 'approach', 'yoga.Also', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Crunch', 'Candlelight', 'Yoga~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
854998,A3DKB9QZUJYBE3,B00049QQLO,"Trixie ""cupcakejones""","[0, 0]","I did this workout on a day where I didn't feel sick enough to skip my workout but not well enough to do a full 45 mins to an hour. I like Sara Ivanhoe as an instructor even if she occasionally over-explains (Her patient, lengthy explanation of how to hold the weights made me giggle. I think virtually 100% of the audience can figure out how to hold a dumbbell.) It's a nice mix but she's not kidding about the length; the whole thing clocks in at 22 minutes total which amounts to only a handful of poses-tree, eagle, side angle, bridge-combined with mostly standard weight moves. I recommend two sets of weights. 2 or 3 pounds is probably about right for tree and eagle or you risk throwing off your balance. For the rest of the workout though, I had to move up to 5 pounds to feel anything. I liked the side angle pose with the shoulder opener the best. You won't get much definition using this regularly but it's better than nothing and would be a nice workout for sick days, injuries or in combination with something else.",3,Nice for an off day,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,1028,"['did', 'workout', 'day', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sick', 'enough', 'skip', 'workout', 'not', 'well', 'enough', 'do', 'full', '45', 'mins', 'hour', 'like', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'instructor', 'even', 'occasionally', 'over-explains', 'patient', 'lengthy', 'explanation', 'how', 'hold', 'weights', 'made', 'giggle', 'think', 'virtually', '100', '%', 'audience', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'hold', 'dumbbell', 'nice', 'mix', 'not', 'kidding', 'length', 'whole', 'thing', 'clocks', '22', 'minutes', 'total', 'only', 'handful', 'poses-tree', 'eagle', 'side', 'angle', 'bridge-combined', 'mostly', 'standard', 'weight', 'moves', 'recommend', 'two', 'sets', 'weights', '2', '3', 'pounds', 'probably', 'about', 'right', 'tree', 'eagle', 'risk', 'throwing', 'off', 'balance', 'rest', 'workout', 'had', 'move', 'up', '5', 'pounds', 'feel', 'anything', 'liked', 'side', 'angle', 'pose', 'shoulder', 'best', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'definition', 'using', 'regularly', 'better', 'nothing', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'workout', 'sick', 'days', 'injuries', 'combination', 'something', 'else']",N/A
