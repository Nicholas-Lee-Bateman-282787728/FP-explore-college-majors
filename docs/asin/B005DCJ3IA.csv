If you have an IQ of 1 you might like it, otherwise, it's crap. It is poorly filmed (like many new movies) and I really couldn't stand watching anybody as retarded as these guys are for more than 5 minutes. It isn't funny, it's just plain stupid. I couldn't see wasting any more time than I already have to continue watching it. I couldn't even bring myself to waste anyone elses time by giving it to them so I threw it in the garbage where it belongs.

1455196,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005DCJ3IA,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The movie opens with some ridiculous bathroom humor as the constipated Belcher (Ryan Dunn) wants his roommate Will (Gerard Haitz) to keep him company, i.e. drink, play cards while he takes ""the Browns to the bowl."" After Belcher dies from constipation, Will's life starts to look up as he dates Belcher's hot cousin Krista. (April Scott). The movie introduces some ""stoners"" who move into Belcher's old room. These characters are very poor copies of ""Bill and Ted."" Their lines and character are forced adding a negative aspect to the film.The ghost of Belcher returns (no special effects) and wants to hang with Will like old times until Belcher finds out Will is dating Krista.Ryan plays an excellent Belcher amidst some lack luster performances. He is a clone of Zach Galifianakis. All the lines were written for him. When Ryan Dunn is not on the screen the film is lame. The sound track is Indie and at times didn't match the scene. As the movie progresses, the antics of Ryan become more destructive and the movie loses its humor as it becomes a tragedy.If you are a fan of Zach Galifianakis type of bizarre humor, then you will find some enjoyment in this film.F-bomb, nudity (A.J.
