400223,ATYKXNLVOZN02,6304084145,Constant Viewer,"[1, 2]","This somewhat overheated film is a remake of a 1936 French film of the same title, with Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux in the lead roles as Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria and his teenaged mistress, Baroness Marie Vetsera.  Both films depend on a great deal of theorizing and guesswork about what is usually described as a murder-suicide in the imperial hunting lodge at Mayerling outside Vienna---with Rudolph shooting his young mistress first, and then himself.To this day, we still don't know, and probably never will know, exactly what led to this murky scandal and its aftermath, with half of Vienna trying to come up with ways to conceal the fact that the Emperor's son and heir had blown out his brains.  The pre-1918 view was that Rudolph was genuinely in love with Marie, 17 years old to his 30, and their deaths resulted from a suicide pact tied to thwarted love.  True, Rudolph had sought permission to divorce his unsympathetic wife, Stephanie of Belgium, ostensibly to marry Marie, but we must doubt whether, after only 3 months' acquaintance, a short, dumpy, dark-haired 17-year-old could have inspired such feelings in a 30-year-old.  Most accounts today agree that he was not Marie's first lover, and that she may well have set her cap for him, but recent historians have sought other reasons for the scandal.  It has been suggested that Rudolph was flirting with opponents to Austrian rule in Hungary, who may have offered him the Hungarian throne in preference to his father, Emperor Franz Josef.  It is also theorized that Rudolph had been in unauthorized contact with French politicians who, if they won an imminent election, held out the promise of a Franco-Austrian alliance that just might have stopped World War I had it been in place in 1914.  Supposedly the collapse of the Hungarian offer and the electoral defeat of Rudolph's prospective French allies, on 2 successive days late in January 1889, left him politically isolated in Vienna and even vulnerable to charges of treason, which he felt left him with no alternative to suicide, which he committed at the end of January 1889.  (But surely if that were the case, he would not have needed to kill Marie, who could have had no part in such intrigues.)While production values are high as regards sets, costumes and photography, the writing and acting in this film are massivley disappointing.  Omar Sharif does a much better job proving he could handle historical romance in &#34;Dr Zhivago,&#34; and Catherine Deneuve surprisingly comes off as a cipher, colorless and seemingly lacking any reason for getting involved with the prince.  (In any case, tall, blonde and beautiful, she bears no resemblance to the real Marie Vetsera, and I can only suppose that a woman of Deneuve's beauty was cast to give some credibility to their love affair. As heir to the throne, Rudolph had his pick of the most beautiful women in Vienna, and his supposed infatuation with the teenaged Marie still defies comprehension.)  Ava Gardner's beauty, still dazzling in 1968, seems to be her sole qualification for portraying Rudolph's mother the ill-fated Empress Elisabeth, and as Franz Josef, James Mason does little more than mutter dialogue that predictably showcases him as a remote, reactionary ruler deeply critical of his son.  These are puppets, not people.In short, this film does nothing to clarify, let alone elucidate, the background to what amounts today to no more than a minor dynastic scandal in a vanished empire.  &#34;The Crown Prince&#34; (2010) tries again, but ends up jamming too much material into the story and, in its own way, confuses matters just as much as does &#34;Mayerling.&#34;  It should be remarked that the tale of Rudolph and Marie has also inspired a ballet and an opera.  That much dramatizing should tell us something:  the story is essentially a clothes peg on which too many garments have been hung, one after the other.  None of them fits.",3,"Disappointing, dramatically and historically",1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,3948,"['somewhat', 'overheated', 'film', 'remake', '1936', 'French', 'film', 'same', 'title', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'Danielle', 'Darrieux', 'lead', 'roles', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Rudolph', 'Austria', 'teenaged', 'mistress', 'Baroness', 'Marie', 'Vetsera', 'films', 'depend', 'great', 'deal', 'theorizing', 'guesswork', 'what', 'usually', 'described', 'murder-suicide', 'imperial', 'hunting', 'lodge', 'Mayerling', 'outside', 'Vienna', '-with', 'Rudolph', 'shooting', 'young', 'mistress', 'first', 'then', 'himself.To', 'day', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'probably', 'never', 'will', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'led', 'murky', 'scandal', 'aftermath', 'half', 'Vienna', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'ways', 'conceal', 'fact', 'Emperor', 'son', 'heir', 'had', 'blown', 'out', 'brains', 'pre-1918', 'view', 'was', 'Rudolph', 'was', 'genuinely', 'love', 'Marie', '17', 'years', 'old', '30', 'deaths', 'resulted', 'suicide', 'pact', 'tied', 'thwarted', 'love', 'True', 'Rudolph', 'had', 'sought', 'permission', 'divorce', 'unsympathetic', 'wife', 'Stephanie', 'Belgium', 'ostensibly', 'marry', 'Marie', 'must', 'doubt', 'only', '3', 'months', 'acquaintance', 'short', 'dumpy', 'dark-haired', '17-year-old', 'could', 'have', 'inspired', 'such', 'feelings', '30-year-old', 'Most', 'accounts', 'today', 'agree', 'was', 'not', 'Marie', 'first', 'lover', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'set', 'cap', 'recent', 'historians', 'have', 'sought', 'other', 'reasons', 'scandal', 'been', 'suggested', 'Rudolph', 'was', 'flirting', 'opponents', 'Austrian', 'rule', 'Hungary', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'offered', 'Hungarian', 'throne', 'preference', 'father', 'Emperor', 'Franz', 'Josef', 'also', 'theorized', 'Rudolph', 'had', 'been', 'unauthorized', 'contact', 'French', 'politicians', 'who', 'won', 'imminent', 'election', 'held', 'out', 'promise', 'Franco-Austrian', 'alliance', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'stopped', 'World', 'War', 'had', 'been', 'place', '1914', 'Supposedly', 'collapse', 'Hungarian', 'offer', 'electoral', 'defeat', 'Rudolph', 'prospective', 'French', 'allies', '2', 'successive', 'days', 'late', 'January', '1889', 'left', 'politically', 'isolated', 'Vienna', 'even', 'vulnerable', 'charges', 'treason', 'felt', 'left', 'alternative', 'suicide', 'committed', 'end', 'January', '1889', 'surely', 'were', 'case', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'needed', 'kill', 'Marie', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'part', 'such', 'intrigues', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'regards', 'sets', 'costumes', 'photography', 'writing', 'acting', 'film', 'are', 'massivley', 'disappointing', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'proving', 'could', 'handle', 'historical', 'romance', '34', 'Dr', 'Zhivago', '34', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'surprisingly', 'off', 'cipher', 'colorless', 'seemingly', 'lacking', 'reason', 'getting', 'involved', 'prince', 'case', 'tall', 'blonde', 'beautiful', 'resemblance', 'real', 'Marie', 'Vetsera', 'can', 'only', 'suppose', 'woman', 'Deneuve', 'beauty', 'was', 'cast', 'give', 'credibility', 'love', 'affair', 'heir', 'throne', 'Rudolph', 'had', 'pick', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Vienna', 'supposed', 'infatuation', 'teenaged', 'Marie', 'still', 'comprehension', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'beauty', 'still', 'dazzling', '1968', 'be', 'sole', 'qualification', 'portraying', 'Rudolph', 'mother', 'ill-fated', 'Empress', 'Elisabeth', 'Franz', 'Josef', 'James', 'Mason', 'little', 'more', 'mutter', 'dialogue', 'predictably', 'remote', 'reactionary', 'ruler', 'deeply', 'critical', 'son', 'are', 'puppets', 'not', 'people.In', 'short', 'film', 'nothing', 'clarify', 'let', 'alone', 'elucidate', 'background', 'what', 'amounts', 'today', 'more', 'minor', 'dynastic', 'scandal', 'vanished', 'empire', '34', 'Crown', 'Prince', '34', '2010', 'tries', 'again', 'up', 'jamming', 'too', 'much', 'material', 'story', 'own', 'way', 'matters', 'just', 'as', 'much', '34', 'Mayerling.', '34', 'should', 'be', 'remarked', 'tale', 'Rudolph', 'Marie', 'also', 'inspired', 'ballet', 'opera', 'much', 'dramatizing', 'should', 'tell', 'something', 'story', 'essentially', 'clothes', 'peg', 'too', 'many', 'garments', 'have', 'been', 'hung', 'one', 'other', 'None', 'fits']",Mayerling VHS

400225,A26HFSVLAGULIM,6304084145,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[23, 25]","IN A NUTSHELL: A FILM WORTH SEEING & HEARINGThis seems to be one of those movies that is either loved, hated or ignored by movie fans. Interestingly, most of the reviews I have seen make mostly relevant points both pro and con. Nevertheless, I do admit feeling some very tugging emotions during many parts of the movie and not just the romantic interludes between the Grand Duke and his very charming young mistress ""Maria Vetsera"" played by Catherine Deneuve. There is a sense of real urgency between ""Grand Duke Rudolf"" played by Omar Sharif and his father ""Emperor Franz Josef"" played by a convincing James Mason. A ""wall"" has been built between the two and the Grand Duke makes it clear to his all powerful sulking father that it will be up to him [the Emperor] to remove it. A task perhaps to great for even the all powerful. I find myself wishing for this universal issue between this father and son to be resolved and its possible historic importance only adds to the urgency.OKAY - THERE ARE SOME ODDITIES ABOUT MAYERLINGNevertheless, although there is much good to be said for the movie as a whole, it does contain some very difficult to take flaws. Casting aside, the wardrobe department made itself very obvious in the choice of eyeshadows, blushes and hairdos that are right out of the 1960s. This emphasis on the 1960's howwever only affects the women so they seem a bit out of place when they are seen typically with uniformed high ranking officials whose wardrobe is very accurately right out of antiquity. This is a needless distraction that detracts from the exquisitely time perfect sets that are genuine in most respects. Also, Ava Gardner [Empress Elizabeth] seems out of place and there is a mix of foriegn and English actors that are for better or worse ample and very correctly attired.AH: BUT THE MUSIC BY KHACHATURIANThe entire film is lifted quite a bit by the very appropriate and well timed saturation of Khachaturian's Best Music from the ballet Spartacus. Most of it sounds like variations from the Adagio movement which is one of the most longing and romantic orchestral overtures ever written and very strongly suggestive of the last vestages of the Holy Roman Empire and this doomed romance which is of course the setting for the entire film.----- * THE CAST --*Omar Sharif  - Crown Prince RudolfCatherine Deneuve  - Maria VetseraJames Mason  - Emperor Franz JosefAva Gardner  - Empress ElizabethJames Robertson-Justice  - Prince Of WalesGenevi?ve Page  - Countess LarischAndr?a Parisy  - Princess StephanieIvan Desny  - Count Josef HoyosFabienne Dali  - Mizzi KasparVeronique Vendell  - Lisi StockauHoward Vernon  - Prince MontenuevoIrene von Meyendorf  - Countess Stockau----- * THE PRODUCTION CREW --*Terence Young  - Director / ScreenwriterRobert Dorfmann  - ProducerClaude Anet  - Book AuthorMichael Arnold  - Book AuthorDennis Cannan  - Dialogue WriterJoseph Kessel  - ScreenwriterHenri Al?kan  - CinematographerFrancis Lai  - Composer (Music Score)Monique Bonnot  - EditorGeorges Wakh?vitch  - Production DesignerMaurice Colasson  - Art DirectorTony Roman  - Art DirectorMarcel Hellman  - Executive ProducerMarcel Escoffier  - Costume DesignerJacques Carrere  - Sound/Sound DesignerJoseph DeBretagne  - Sound/Sound Designer----- * AWARDS --*Best Foreign Film - English Language (nom)  1969  Golden GlobeBOTTOM LINE:Sentimental and very compelling period piece with great personalities brought to the screen by great actors.

400228,A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,6304084145,"Tracy Rowan ""dargelos""","[22, 40]","In early 1889, Crown Prince Rudolph, son of Emperor Franz Joseph and heir to the Hapsburg Empire, took his teenage mistress, Baroness Maria Vetsera, to a hunting lodge called ""Mayerling.""  What happened there has been the subject of a good deal of speculation, but the most popular version is this:  That sometime in the early morning hours of January 30th, Rudolph killed Maria with a single shot from his revolver, and then, some hours later, took his own life.  How they came to this moment in time is the subject of the film, ""Mayerling"" which stars Omar Sharif as Rudolph and Catherine Deneuve as Maria.The film is highly sympathetic to the lovers, portraying them as kindred souls beset by the prejudices and stupidities of everyone around them.  Rudolph's liberal political views and Maria's innocence are made much of, and the idea that they were driven to the desperation of a suicide pact is central to the persuasiveness of this film.  Unfortunately I have a hard time buying any of it, and perhaps it's partly because I know too much about the real couple and their situation, but I think it's also because the film is so heavy-handed that we feel more bludgeoned than persuaded.  Sharif is wooden as Rudolph, but in all fairness some of the lines he's asked to deliver are almost laughable.  The Oedipal subtext between Rudolph and his mother, Elizabeth, has no real purpose beyond titillation, and it is frankly difficult to believe in Deneuve as ing&eacute;nue.  Had all the roles been written with more authenticity the story might well have worked as a tragedy, but Terence Young, who apparently drew on the novels of Claude Anet and Michel Arnold to write the screenplay, has taken the easy route here, complete with cardboard villains and people's heroes.  Not even James Mason as Franz Joseph or the ravishing Ava Gardner as Empress Elizabeth can propel this particular film out of the category of Bad Romance.The look of the film owes more to the era in which it was made than that which it seeks to portray.  Makeup, hairstyles, even costumes reflect a sixties sensibility which may have put audiences at ease in 1968, but which are jarring today.  Frankly, this is one of the things that can really turn me off of a film; I tolerate it in ""Doctor Zhivago,"" but in ""Mayerling"" it becomes so distracting, that any credibility this film might have had for me goes right out the window whenever I see an actress with overdone, sixties-style eyeliner or lots and lots of hair woven into intricate, sixties-inspired dos.
