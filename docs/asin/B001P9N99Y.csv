1226499,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001P9N99Y,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Perkins 14 is basically another zombie movie.  Alright so technically the wild people roaming the streets aren't zombies in the true sense, so let's just call them enhanced ultra relentless zombies.  You see it's about these people that were trapped underground for 10 years and drugged to be super powerful, and when released they appear with a vengeance against all the normal people around town.  It's about a father, mother and daughter that do whatever it takes to escape and survive.  One of the zombies in particular is the oldest son.  He was lost for 10 years, assumed dead but he's actually still alive and more aggressive than ever.  What will happen when the family comes across their son one evening?  You'll have to see for yourself but let it be known the ending is really good.  Best part of the movie.The problem here is that we're not seeing anything particularly new in the zombie genre.  This is all run of the mill stuff.  Some of the acting is pretty bad as well.  The mother spends her entire time freaking out and overexaggerating, the daughter is a dirty little... and the father sporting his Raul Ibanez look (Yankees/Mariners/Phillies baseball player) is one of the highlights being an ""always ready for anything"" police officer, in addition to being pretty intelligent and focused.  The biggest problem is that the man responsible for creating these abnormal beings gets written out of the storyline fairly early and it's a shame since he's clearly the most enticing character in the movie given his unpredictable and offbeat persona.  What a waste of potential.  Not a bad movie though, hence the 3-star rating.

1226502,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001P9N99Y,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 8]","""Perkins' 14"" begins decently enough. We meet Dwayne Hopper (Patrick O'Kane), a police officer from the small town of Stone Cove. He has been detached from his wife and daughter ever since his son, Kyle, was kidnapped some years earlier along with thirteen other children, and now he's consumed with finding the culprit. Whether or not his son is still alive, he doesn't know. All he does know is that tonight is the tenth anniversary of the first kidnapping, and he begins to suspect that one of his inmates, pharmacist Ronald Perkins (Richard Brake), is responsible. Hopper then coerces one of his fellow officers to search Perkins' home for evidence. This leads to the discovery of a secret cellar, which is hellishly dark and dank, filled with medication vials and stacks of videocassettes.But before I go any further, let's examine why the first part of this film works. There were hints that the relationship between Hopper and Perkins would develop in much the same way as the one between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. Perkins methodically probes Hopper's mind, trying to find his weak points so that they can be exploited. Hopper tries to be strong, but it's obvious that the pressure is getting to him, which is understandable given his one-track mind. And then there's the relationship between Hopper and his remaining family, which is strained to say the least. He doesn't get along too well with his daughter, Daisy (Shayla Beesley), who dresses a bit punkish and is dating a much older guitar player named Eric (Michale Graves), who apparently has a criminal record. As for Hopper's wife, Janine (Mihaela Mihut), she's been having an affair for who knows how long. Given her husband's inability to move on, her actions are somewhat understandable.Then, without warning, ""Perkins' 14"" shifts gears, veering away from psychological drama to become a gory zombie film. It begins when Hopper's assistant discovers the aforementioned secret cellar; along with the meds and cassettes, he also finds filthy teenagers locked in cages. He opens one of them, thinking the girl within is desperately in need of help. Rather than cling to him like a helpless child, she savagely attacks him. It isn't long before the other wild teens are released, which quickly plunges Stone Cove into chaos. The townspeople are brutally attacked and killed by mindless, violent teens, which under different circumstances might have worked as satire. It soon becomes a life or death struggle, with Hopper and his family barricaded in a police station.I did not like the last three quarters of this film. For one thing, the idea behind the killings is completely implausible, even within the context of a horror movie: As revenge for being forgotten when his parents were brutally murdered, Perkins used cult-like techniques and mega doses of PCP to brainwash fourteen Stone Cove children. Once they break free from his cellar, their new programming only allows them to do Perkins' bidding. Does this sound a little far fetched to you? It sounds to me like a diabolical plot only a mad scientist in a grade-B movie would think up. Indeed, maybe this film would have worked better if it had gone in the direction of a parody. That would necessitate a complete rewrite of the film's first quarter, but hey, at least the film would have been both consistent and fun.There's also the fact that the final twenty minutes or so take place in areas so poorly lit that there's no sense of mystery or suspense. The Stone Cove police station is a maze of dark hallways and strobe-light effects, which is visually irritating.But the biggest problem is the needlessly dark nature of the plot. There's no sense of classic horror movie fun with this movie; there's only a prolonged sense of hopelessness and grief, and that just seems a bit melodramatic. This movie ends on such a low note that it was impossible for me to feel thrilled, and isn't that what horror movies are all about?Now here's the interesting thing: ""Perkins' 14"" is the first ever fan-generated horror movie. Fans and filmmakers alike were asked to submit story ideas to Massify.com, where a team of judges would vote on the best one. Out of 400 submissions, Jeremy Donaldson's story about fourteen mindless sociopaths attacking a small town got the most votes. I admit, the idea is intriguing, especially since it plays on our fears of what would happen after a dangerous criminal is arrested and put behind bars. But in the hands of screenwriter Lane Shadgett and director Craig Singer, the idea was turned into a complete mess of a film. ""Perkins' 14"" is unpleasant and unfocused, and it doesn't seem to value the possibility of hope. If another horror movie is made on the basis of an idea submitted by fans, I can only offer this piece of advice: Make sure you hire filmmakers who can actually make something of it.",2,Unleashing a

1226505,AWN6ZMWWMUWLX,B001P9N99Y,J. Friday,"[2, 2]","I don't recommend this film at all. But if you must see it, it's in an 8 film pack called ""8 Films to Die For: After Dark Horrorfest III"". If you buy that pack you get 8 films instead of one.The good: the cinematography. I liked the way it flowed and looked professional.The bad: everything else. The directing was appalling. It's all long shots and close-ups. I can't remember and medium shots. There are constant flashbacks. It's usually those jittery flashbacks you see in horror where the camera is flicking and jumping from shot to shot. Plus, there is idiotic camera shaking to try to make the scene appear more tense. I can't think of any viewer who has liked to watch camera shaking. Why do directors put this crap in?The acting was bad, wooden, and forced. Yes, the lines were cliched. The script was terrible. The characterizations were one-dimensional and cliched. So were the situations: ""Hey, there's a guy with a bloody axe walking toward us. Let me walk up to him and ask him what he's doing."" Yes, it features the obligatory unsuspecting teenagers who are having sex and smoking marijuana getting attacked/murdered in cliched horror. It also features police officers who enter a scene without drawing their guns. Yes, when the main cop character sees his partner bloodied and hanging from a ceiling, the cop does not decide to draw his gun. Amazing. Whenenver the cops do draw their gun they hold it like you'd hold a TV remote. All--and I mean all--the police officers in the town of Stone Cove are incompetent. From the license plates, Stone Cove is in Maine. Thus, we can only assume that the U.S. state of Maine has the dumbest cops in the United States. Plus, they are entirely useless. When characters are attacked and killed right in front of their eyes they do not draw their guns. Instead, they watch in disbelief just a few feet away while the zombies mutilate and eat people. Apparently, Maine cops make Illinois cops look like geniuses. And that's no easy feat!Most of the deaths are predictable. For one reason, characters leave doors open/unlocked all the time. That frustrated me to no end. In every scene a character is leaving the door open/unlocked. So that means you know who is going to be killed. Most of the deaths happen off-screen. Other deaths aren't shown properly; either they are shown in a blurry long shot or a dark long shot. Throughout this entire movie I kept saying things like, ""Okay, that is incredibly stupid. And if you don't get killed for checking out that weird noise in the dark corner then I'm gonna be pissed."" Thankfully, they were almost always killed.Some reviewers say the ending was bleak and downbeat. It didn't bother me. I never cared for any of the characters. The fact that it ended when it did was a positive thing for me. I might have punched my laptop out of anger.All in all, the movie should have stuck to the beginning thriller element. During the beginning Hooper, the main cop character, is interrogating the guy, Perkins, because Hooper thinks Perkins kidnapped Hooper's soon. The filmmaker could have turned this into a psychological thriller if he had stayed with that. It was intriguing and had room for a lot of tension. But the zombie element was tacked on, rushed, cliched, and predictable. Hopefully, there won't be a Perkins' 15. Plus, I can't find anything that says the director and writer have been able to do more work after the garbage that is Perkins' 14. So that's proof there is a God.Oh yeah, lastly, let me warn you about the end. In the end, the characters are sheltering themselves in the police station. The director used amateurish camera techniques such as blinking lights, too much darkness, excessive camera shaking for the last 30 minutes, give or take a few minutes. That part was extremely bad on my eyes. I had to keep adjusting and focusing my vision. More than 10 minutes after watching this film I had to rest my eyes. I kept them closed and kept rubbing them.

Perkins' 14 is the most interesting of the bunch, considering its history involves a fan-submitted idea and story.  While that alone is reason enough to give this film a look, Perkins' 14 as a whole sadly doesn't amount to much.  The story involves small town cop Dwayne (Patrick O'Kane) whose young son was kidnapped a decade earlier.  He soon figures out that the abductor is Ronald Perkins (Richard Brake) and that he's inhabiting one of the cells at the station, and learns that his son is still alive, and among the 14 children that Perkins had imprisoned and experimented upon to turn them into killing machines.  And before you know it, they're all set free and begin wreaking havoc on the town.  That's all there really is plot wise, as Perkins' 14 features some gigantic leaps in logic and a variety of dumb people doing dumb things and winding up dead for it.  There might be some level of enjoyment to find in the film, but it is so bleak, gloomy, and awfully lit that it will be hard to do so.  Directed by Craig Singer, who helmed Dark Ride for the first round of After Dark Horrorfest flicks, Perkins' 14 is a disappointing waste.  There was Feast-style potential here to be sure in terms of the story, setting, and characters, but in the end, Perkins' 14 falls mostly flat.

I originally thought that was going to be a good thing (it sounded like a continuation of the final scene of a really bad seventies TV movie called The Clone Master. Ever see it? Don't bother). Then it turned out to be a very, very bad thing, but not a bad thing so bad that I actually turned the movie off. It's watchable, in a ""how awful can this thing get?"" kind of way, and sometimes that's just what the doctor ordered. Not this time, but still.The Perkins of the title (Cold Mountain's Richard Brake) kidnapped a series of fourteen children from a small town over the course of a decade or so, including the son of Dwayne Hopper (Exorcist: The Beginning's Patrick O'Kane), a sheriff's deputy. After a chance encounter brings the two of them together, Hopper gets the idea that Perkins may be responsible for the disappearances, and sends another officer out to Perkins' house while Hopper interrogates him. This turns out to be an exceptionally bad idea, for Perkins has the house booby-trapped, and he's trained his ill-gotten kids to be very, very bad indeed. And once they get out of the house...I saw seven or eight different paths as I was watching this that the script could have taken that would have made this a pretty good movie. It took none of them, instead going right between serial killer avenue and zombie invasion boulevard, snatching all the usual clich&eacute;s and putting them in all the proper places, right down to the predictable ending that was supposed to be unpredictable (it's so clich&eacute; I can't even bring myself to call it a twist). For as high-caliber a cast as Singer (Dark Ride) was able to assemble for this flick, as well, the acting really seemed kind of low on the scale. Brake does some good work, but Irish-born O'Kane's redneck accent sounds more like Henry Rollins trying to talk like a robot, and most of the rest of the cast go downhill from there. The direction is competent, if nothing inspired, but that alone is almost never enough to carry a movie where everything else is so mediocre-to-awful.

Hopper also has an adulterous wife and a goth-light daughter who has the type of boyfriend you wouldn't invite over for Sunday dinner with Mom & Dad.  The cages are accidently unlocked, Sheriff Hopper kills Perkins and then the carnage begins to escalate in a series of brutal and gruesome killings.The father-son reunion towards the end is both heart-breaking andhorrifying.

1226512,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B001P9N99Y,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[5, 6]","Here we have one of the few truly interesting concepts from the Afterdark series.  The setup goes that, 10 years prior to the film start, this man Perkins has kidnapped 14 children and raised them in kennels in his basement - we assume he conditioned them to essentially be his army of killers.  One of the parents of the kidnapped children happens to be a police officer who comes to suspect the man in his jail cell is the kidnapper, and through a series of events, accidentally sets these 14 psycho killers loose upon the small town to wreak havoc.As I said, the setup is very interesting.  It's a shame, then, that director Craig Singer (who also helmed the abysmal DARK RIDE from the first Horror-fest) could not find an interesting story to tell with such fertile ground.  It's hard to really decide where the blame should go.  The film is largely shot well, and the acting is, at worst, average for a horror film.  So who to blame?  I would begin with the writers.  The dialogue itself is not particularly bad, but it is the plotting and pacing that cause the film to suffer.  The film spends exactly half of its running time getting to the point of releasing the killers - while the first half is interesting in a slowly-building tension sort of way as the cop and kidnapper engage in a ""Hannibal Lector"" style dialogue, it goes on entirely too long, and as such we aren't given nearly enough time to invest in the aftermath of the psychos being unleashed.  A better director would have accomplished the first half of the film in about twenty minutes.As for that second half, being rushed and probably working with a limited budget, we have to glean from radio calls that the mayhem is going on city wide, because we never really see it.  These 14 psychos from the title actually amount to about 5 psychos on screen, and they largely only attack our main family of characters.  Within about twenty minutes of the escape, the characters are already holed up inside the city jail, where the remainder of the film plays out.  And at this point, the viewer has never really gained any compassion for any of these characters, who are predictably one-dimensional.  You have the typical goth-daughter, the cheating wife, and a doofus of a father, none of which elicit the slightest bit of sympathy.Now, when I say doofus, I mean it!  This father/cop is a terrible character for a protagonist, who makes some of the dumbest choices in the history of horror.  He relentlessly puts others in danger for no good reason.  Early on, he sends an off-duty officer to check out the kidnappers house with NO BACK-UP.  Later, he leaves a civilian in the back seat of his police cruiser, which he just got finished telling the audience can ONLY be opened from the outside!  Not long after, he allows another civilian to go to the bathroom all alone when the psychos have invaded the jail.  Near the end, he actually sends his wife to go fetch the keys on the other side of the psycho-filled jail while he remains in the locked room with the shotgun.  And in the most incomprehensible move of all time, actually locks his daughter in a jail cell and in the next scene literally hands the keys to one of the psychos!!But he's not the only doofus - other characters repeatedly stand by and watch friends and loved ones being attacked and devoured without even attempting to help - including a police officer who simply stands dumbfounded, shining his flashlight at one of the bloody murders happening just three feet away from him!!  One character even allows a psycho to slowly approach her, strip her of the shotgun she was holding, and blow her away with it.  Why she didn't fire on him the moment he entered the room  . . . .?It's this kind of idiocy on the part of the characters that thoroughly sink the second half of the film. What could have been an effectively intense final act along the lines of a film like 30 DAYS OF NIGHT, instead falls into just one excuse after another to showcase an extreme amount of gore.  The filmmakers seem only to revel in trying to gross out the audience (including one groaningly poor effect of a psycho crawling away from his severed legs - you can clearly see the board the actor is laying on being dragged away from the prosthetic legs).Seeing as how this film did not get a wide release, I would be interested to see a more talented director and cast pick it up.  The idea of  conditioned killers, one of which is the son of the protagonist, could make for a very interesting psychological thriller.

1226514,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B001P9N99Y,Tim Janson,"[3, 5]","Perkins 14 is another entry in this year's batch of After Dark Horrorfest films and one of the better ones.  Patrick O'Kane plays Dwayne Hopper, a member of a small tourist town's Sheriff Department.  Ten year's earlier, Hopper's son Kyle was kidnapped from his bedroom, the last of 14 child abductions that went unsolved.  The pain of losing his son has driven Dwayne to alcoholism and torn his marriage apart.  As Dwayne checks in for the night shift, he finds that a mysterious man named Perkins is locked up in the jail.  As Dwayne talks to him, he becomes convinced that this man may no something about the child abductions.Against orders from his superiors, Dwayne investigates the man's home to find numerous dank, dirty, but empty cells in Perkins' basement.  He also finds a library of video tapes, all showing the torturous treatment the children received at the hands of Mr. Perkins.  Now you're thinking that this may be one of those cat and mouse type thrillers where the cop knows who the killer is but does not have any legal evidence to charge him with.  Will the cop go against his superiors to get revenge on the man who took his son?  Ah, but here's where Perkins 14 tosses us a curve ball.  It's a tale of revenge to be sure, but not the cop's revenge.  As mentioned, Dwayne found only empty cells.  Those children, now teenagers, tortured and turned into feral, drugged up beasts, have been set loose on the small town in a rampaging, ""28 Days Later"" style, attacking everything in their path and devouring their prey.Director Craig Singer's quick change of direction from taut thriller to zombie-style action was surprising and well disguised.  There's gore-a-plenty as bodies are literally ripped to pieces leaving the bestial kids to wrestle over pieces of entrails.  It culminates with a standoff in the town's police station as a small group of survivors tries to survive the night.Perkins 14 is not without its drawbacks.  It's hard to imagine that a small town could be overrun by a group of 14 people, even if they are animalistic.  Rather than try to remain hidden in their homes the residents of Stone Cove seem all too willing to venture out at night and make themselves easy targets.  And it seems as if the Sheriff's office only has about three guns...go figure.  The women in the film, and I mean all of them, are guilty of overacting, particularly Mihaela Mihut, who plays Dwayne's wife, Janine.  They end up distracting the viewer from the plot and you're soon hoping they become the next meal.Singer also directed the 2006 After Dark Horrorfest entry, Dark Ride, and while it's not a classic, Perkins 14 is certainly better than that earlier effort.",3,Gruesome Fun,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,2687,"['Perkins', '14', 'entry', 'year', 'batch', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'films', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'Patrick', ""O'Kane"", 'Dwayne', 'Hopper', 'member', 'small', 'tourist', 'town', 'Sheriff', 'Department', 'Ten', 'year', 'earlier', 'Hopper', 'son', 'Kyle', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'bedroom', 'last', '14', 'child', 'abductions', 'went', 'unsolved', 'pain', 'losing', 'son', 'driven', 'Dwayne', 'alcoholism', 'torn', 'marriage', 'apart', 'Dwayne', 'checks', 'night', 'shift', 'mysterious', 'man', 'named', 'Perkins', 'locked', 'up', 'jail', 'Dwayne', 'talks', 'convinced', 'man', 'may', 'no', 'something', 'child', 'abductions.Against', 'orders', 'superiors', 'Dwayne', 'man', 'home', 'find', 'numerous', 'dank', 'dirty', 'empty', 'cells', 'Perkins', 'basement', 'also', 'library', 'video', 'tapes', 'showing', 'torturous', 'treatment', 'children', 'received', 'hands', 'Mr.', 'Perkins', 'Now', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'cat', 'mouse', 'type', 'thrillers', 'where', 'cop', 'who', 'killer', 'not', 'have', 'legal', 'evidence', 'charge', 'Will', 'cop', 'go', 'superiors', 'get', 'revenge', 'man', 'who', 'took', 'son', 'Ah', 'here', 'where', '14', 'tosses', 'curve', 'ball', 'tale', 'revenge', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'cop', 'revenge', 'mentioned', 'Dwayne', 'found', 'only', 'empty', 'cells', 'children', 'now', 'teenagers', 'tortured', 'turned', 'feral', 'drugged', 'up', 'beasts', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'loose', 'small', 'town', 'rampaging', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'style', 'attacking', 'everything', 'path', 'devouring', 'prey.Director', 'Craig', 'Singer', 'quick', 'change', 'direction', 'taut', 'thriller', 'zombie-style', 'action', 'was', 'surprising', 'well', 'disguised', 'gore-a-plenty', 'bodies', 'are', 'literally', 'ripped', 'pieces', 'leaving', 'bestial', 'kids', 'wrestle', 'over', 'pieces', 'entrails', 'standoff', 'town', 'police', 'station', 'small', 'group', 'survivors', 'tries', 'survive', 'night.Perkins', '14', 'not', 'drawbacks', 'hard', 'imagine', 'small', 'town', 'could', 'be', 'overrun', 'group', '14', 'people', 'even', 'are', 'animalistic', 'Rather', 'try', 'remain', 'hidden', 'homes', 'residents', 'Stone', 'Cove', 'seem', 'too', 'willing', 'venture', 'out', 'night', 'make', 'easy', 'targets', 'Sheriff', 'office', 'only', 'three', 'guns', 'go', 'figure', 'women', 'film', 'mean', 'are', 'guilty', 'overacting', 'particularly', 'Mihaela', 'Mihut', 'who', 'Dwayne', 'wife', 'Janine', 'end', 'up', 'distracting', 'viewer', 'plot', ""'re"", 'soon', 'hoping', 'become', 'next', 'meal.Singer', 'also', 'directed', '2006', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'entry', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'not', 'classic', 'Perkins', '14', 'certainly', 'better', 'earlier', 'effort']",Perkins' 14: After Dark Horrorfest III

They must have gotten every freaky looking goon with a Screen Actors Guild card to star in this thing and it was amateur hour to the extreme. The story isn't so bad to start out, a man who suffered a tragedy wants to get back at the people who didn't do anything to help him. He does this by kidnapping 14 of the towns children, and yes, his name was Perkins. This strange, evil, little man decided to drug these kids with PCP, until there brains are mush, and then he tortured them into become zombies, who would be unleashed if anything ever happened to him, and yes, something happens to him. From there, this film becomes one badly acted gorefest that makes no sense at all. Body parts fly, intestines come out and get consumed, and the town of Stone Cove becomes overrun. This whole thing was ridiculous and I can't believe it was chosen to be part of the After Dark Horrorfest.
