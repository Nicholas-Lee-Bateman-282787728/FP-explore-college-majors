I felt sorry for her but noticed as the series went on she was losing those pounds.  I ordered all the seasons that were available and have cancelled my cable so I can just watch the series I want to watch without all the political garbage in and out of time.  I also loved that she would bring on her parents to do some of the folks that were in her TV mom family.  Her Dad is so funny and her mom as well.  Also she has her dog Chester which is her dog on the show.  This one I think shows a out take of her flossing his teeth and telling him what a good dog he was.  I learned a lesson for my dog died from a heart condition from his bad teeth.  If I ever get another dog it will be a pup and I will start her out on flossing right from the beginning so I do not have to see another dog I loved die early from dental health problems.you will love it if you love Fran.

Thank Goodness It's Fran..Fran dresses like a man to infiltrate an exclusive all-male club; Mr. Sheffield dates a dead-ringer for Fran; Niles auditions for Maxwell's latest play; and Brighton's knack for cards lands him on Sylvia's canasta team. And that's only the beginning.THE NANNY has remained popular in reruns on Antenna-TV, TV Land, Nickelodeon, and on Lifetime.",4,A Nanny Named Fran,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,913,"['Franny', 'Fine', 'Fran', 'Drescher', 'clean', 'house', 'hilarious', '1994-95', 'Season', 'Nanny', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'television', 'most', 'popular', 'sitcoms', 'Nanny', 'took', 'home', 'Emmy-Award', 'second', 'season', 'Best', 'Costuming', 'making', 'most', 'fashionable', 'show', 'television.In', 'Sophomore', 'season', 'show', 'ran', 'CBS', '1993-99', 'Fran', 'Drescher', 'Charles', 'Shaughnessy', 'Daniel', 'Davis', 'Lauren', 'Lane', 'Nicholle', 'Tom', 'Benjamin', 'Salisbury', 'Madeline', 'Zima', 'Renee', 'Taylor', 'are', 'up', 'same', 'old', 'tricks', 'will', 'have', 'saying', 'T.G.I.F', 'Thank', 'Goodness', 'Fran..Fran', 'dresses', 'man', 'infiltrate', 'exclusive', 'all-male', 'club', 'Mr.', 'Sheffield', 'dead-ringer', 'Fran', 'Niles', 'auditions', 'Maxwell', 'latest', 'play', 'Brighton', 'knack', 'cards', 'Sylvia', 'canasta', 'team', 'only', 'beginning.THE', 'NANNY', 'remained', 'popular', 'reruns', 'Antenna-TV', 'TV', 'Land', 'Nickelodeon', 'Lifetime']",The Nanny - The Complete Second Season

A native New Yorker born and bred and from the sleeper Borough of Queens myself, I have to admit that I love this show, though bits about big hair and her voice are way over the top, yes exaggerated for those whom never have been to New York City before. The parts with the loud talking, interrupting and slapping each other are so New York city. If you need a laugh a minute this is the show to watch. It is otherwise so New York city. It is hilarious. Now mind you, I never viewed this show when it first aired. I have no idea why, except that I wasn't watching TV at the time this aired. I'm now working my way through the DVD series. Where was I when this shirt first aired? Fran Drescher is just too funny.Overall, this is a wonderful series for the entire family too watch and grown up enough for just adults.",5,Another season to enjoy!
