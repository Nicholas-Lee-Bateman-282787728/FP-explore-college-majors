1464111,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005LAIGIM,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I went in seriously worried that Eddie Murphy lost a few steps thanks to the disaster that is Tower Heist, but the reality is that Eddie Murphy is a more suitable and hilarious comedian when the attention is on him moreso than anyone else.  Or perhaps my hatred for Ben Stiller played a part in my dissatisfaction for that movie.What makes A Thousand Words so wonderful is the subtle approach to comedy.  It doesn't seem subtle at first and in fact, initially seems like another pitiful attempt at humor that misses the mark (just like Tower Heist unforgivably proves).  However as soon as Eddie visits the spiritual guru and especially when the mysterious tree of life forms in his back yard one evening, this is when the introduction to the storyline gets underway- that being, Eddie quickly finds out that he's not allowed to speak more than a thousand words or he will... I guess die.  I don't remember if that was ever stated outright or not.Another funny element (and this is surprising to me) is one of Eddie's workmates who's a dorky, talkative guy with a big mouth who happens to always find himself in hilarious situations with Eddie which especially become evident as soon as Eddie is forced to go through his 3-day period of using as little words as possible, so Eddie's facial expressions become a focal point.  More humor follows whenever Eddie communicates with his wife as they (or rather, she) discusses marriage and home problems.  Again, Eddie has to keep quiet!  The way he orders food at the uptown restaurant provides additional humor as the cashier guy has to figure out what Eddie's trying to order through hand movements and facial expressions, lol.With a really creative way of slowly building the humor through interesting storytelling, perhaps I shouldn't be so shocked that the ending -the part where Eddie visits his mom who happens to have memory loss problems and insists Eddie is actually her husband- is so effectively moving.  I was *almost* in tears in one particular spot.  I won't reveal what it is that makes it so moving, though.  Great writing there.  I also felt sadness whenever Eddie was forced to speak and leaves would fall off the tree in his back yard.  The writing makes it sad, not funny.Overall, Eddie rebounds after the pitiful Tower Heist with a really great movie.",4,"thankfully, I was laughing",1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,2318,"['went', 'seriously', 'worried', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'lost', 'few', 'steps', 'thanks', 'disaster', 'Tower', 'Heist', 'reality', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'more', 'suitable', 'hilarious', 'comedian', 'when', 'attention', 'moreso', 'anyone', 'else', 'perhaps', 'hatred', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'played', 'part', 'dissatisfaction', 'Thousand', 'Words', 'so', 'wonderful', 'subtle', 'approach', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'seem', 'subtle', 'first', 'fact', 'initially', 'pitiful', 'attempt', 'humor', 'mark', 'just', 'Tower', 'Heist', 'unforgivably', 'However', 'as', 'soon', 'Eddie', 'spiritual', 'guru', 'especially', 'when', 'mysterious', 'tree', 'life', 'forms', 'back', 'yard', 'one', 'evening', 'when', 'introduction', 'storyline', 'underway-', 'being', 'Eddie', 'quickly', 'out', 'not', 'allowed', 'speak', 'more', 'thousand', 'words', 'will', 'guess', 'die', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'ever', 'stated', 'outright', 'funny', 'element', 'surprising', 'one', 'Eddie', 'workmates', 'who', 'dorky', 'talkative', 'guy', 'big', 'mouth', 'who', 'always', 'find', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'Eddie', 'especially', 'become', 'evident', 'as', 'soon', 'Eddie', 'forced', 'go', '3-day', 'period', 'using', 'little', 'words', 'possible', 'Eddie', 'facial', 'expressions', 'become', 'focal', 'point', 'More', 'humor', 'whenever', 'Eddie', 'wife', 'rather', 'marriage', 'home', 'problems', 'Again', 'Eddie', 'keep', 'quiet', 'way', 'orders', 'food', 'uptown', 'restaurant', 'additional', 'humor', 'cashier', 'guy', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Eddie', 'trying', 'order', 'hand', 'movements', 'facial', 'expressions', 'really', 'creative', 'way', 'slowly', 'building', 'humor', 'interesting', 'storytelling', 'perhaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'shocked', 'ending', '-the', 'part', 'where', 'Eddie', 'mom', 'who', 'have', 'memory', 'loss', 'problems', 'insists', 'Eddie', 'actually', 'husband-', 'so', 'effectively', 'moving', 'was', '*almost*', 'tears', 'one', 'particular', 'spot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'what', 'so', 'moving', 'though', 'Great', 'writing', 'there', 'also', 'felt', 'sadness', 'whenever', 'Eddie', 'was', 'forced', 'speak', 'leaves', 'would', 'fall', 'off', 'tree', 'back', 'yard', 'writing', 'sad', 'not', 'funny.Overall', 'Eddie', 'pitiful', 'Tower', 'Heist', 'really', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

Much of it is Eddie Murphy going over the top, which doesn't really work as well when you're trying to combine humor with a heartwarming story. However, what really undermines the film is that too often too many of the characters make ridiculously stupid choices.

1464136,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B005LAIGIM,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","In my opinion good comedians always seem to get themselves into movies that don't really show just how funny they are. Leaving them to take on roles that just leave you bewildered. From ""Norbit"" to ""Daddy Day Care"" to ""Dr. Dolittle"" Eddie Murphy has taken on a string of movies that didn't do a good job of exemplifying his comedic value. A Thousand Words, in my opinion, is a breathe of fresh air compared to some of Eddie's other works.This is one of those movies where the overall message can be different for each viewer. For me the overall message was not only to watch what you say, but to fully understand how powerful words can be. Jack McCall (Eddie) has no grasp of this concept, he talks continuously constantly trying to manipulate people to do what he feels is best for him, and in the end it winds up being his downfall.One thing that really bothered me while watching this film was Jack's wife Caroline (Kerry Washington.) Everything about her character just irritated me. Jack was unable to talk so she automatically took it as he didn't want to talk to her and went to the conclusion that he didn't love her. Then when they were in the hotel and she was trying to find the ""spark"" in their ""broken relationship"" she tried to get him to talk. It was clear he wanted to talk and it was clear he was having some sort of internal struggle regarding it, but she paid all that no mind and walked out with his clothes. I don't know why it bothered me so much, it just did. Probably because I know there are some women out there who do in fact react like that.I did feel they pushed the limits regarding the PG-13 rating. The profanity is a little more frequent compared to some other PG-13 films, you see Jack flip off the tree, and you see his wife dressed in a sexual role-playing outfit. Some material parents might find inappropriate for their young teens.Overall Score: 7/10 - As I said compared to some of Eddie's other works this is pretty enjoyable. It's not perfect, and some parts do come off stale, but overall it's a good comedy film. As a stand-up comedian I feel Eddie is hilarious, but he always seems to come up short when he's in a movie.",4,7/10 - Better than expected,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,2165,"['opinion', 'good', 'comedians', 'always', 'seem', 'get', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'are', 'Leaving', 'take', 'roles', 'just', 'leave', 'bewildered', 'Norbit', 'Daddy', 'Day', 'Care', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'taken', 'string', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'job', 'exemplifying', 'comedic', 'value', 'Thousand', 'Words', 'opinion', 'breathe', 'fresh', 'air', 'compared', 'Eddie', 'other', 'works.This', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'overall', 'message', 'can', 'be', 'different', 'viewer', 'overall', 'message', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'watch', 'what', 'say', 'fully', 'understand', 'how', 'powerful', 'words', 'can', 'be', 'Jack', 'McCall', 'Eddie', 'grasp', 'concept', 'continuously', 'constantly', 'trying', 'manipulate', 'people', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'downfall.One', 'thing', 'really', 'bothered', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'Jack', 'wife', 'Caroline', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Everything', 'character', 'just', 'irritated', 'Jack', 'was', 'unable', 'talk', 'automatically', 'took', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', 'went', 'conclusion', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'Then', 'when', 'were', 'hotel', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'spark', 'broken', 'relationship', 'tried', 'get', 'talk', 'was', 'clear', 'wanted', 'talk', 'was', 'clear', 'was', 'having', 'sort', 'internal', 'struggle', 'regarding', 'paid', 'mind', 'walked', 'out', 'clothes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'bothered', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'did', 'Probably', 'know', 'are', 'women', 'who', 'do', 'fact', 'react', 'that.I', 'did', 'feel', 'pushed', 'limits', 'regarding', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'profanity', 'little', 'more', 'frequent', 'compared', 'other', 'PG-13', 'films', 'see', 'Jack', 'flip', 'off', 'tree', 'see', 'wife', 'dressed', 'sexual', 'role-playing', 'outfit', 'material', 'parents', 'might', 'find', 'inappropriate', 'young', 'teens.Overall', 'Score', '7/10', 'said', 'compared', 'Eddie', 'other', 'works', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'perfect', 'parts', 'do', 'come', 'off', 'stale', 'overall', 'good', 'comedy', 'film', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'feel', 'Eddie', 'hilarious', 'always', 'come', 'up', 'short', 'when', 'movie']",N/A

It will not be good for Jack if the tree becomes bare.""Don't talk for three days. How hard could it be?"" Jack had to come up with ways to communicate in person and on the phone without words.

There were parts that made me laugh a bit, but there were also parts I'm sure were supposed to be funny but didn't make me laugh. Everything that had to do with Jack's family life - those were the scenes (except the one in the hotel room) I liked best. Clark Duke did a good job; I liked his character best. And Murphy's performance near the end really touched me. I'd love to see him in more dramatic roles.When I saw the movie trailer a while back, my first thought was 'this movie has a New Age theme', but that didn't keep me from checking it out because as a Christian I know what I believe; not every movie I watch is Christian-based.Death - we all know it's going to happen one day, but many take life and other people for granted.

The film itself - which is  often slower in pace in parts and not really `flowing' from scene-to-scene - seems to take its' time to get where its going. Probably from a simple and mundane script from Steven Koren who amazingly also wrote such scripts as Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty, Click and was a regular writer on SNL.The most interesting part and most pleasing thing about this film was Eddie Murphy himself. Unfortunately , even with a bad script and poor direction, Eddie could only shine on a gag-by-gag basis and does have some good physical comedy moments. Not worth the theatre price but definitely a good `catch on cable' or DVD rental show.The concept is simple. Eddie gets `magically' connect to a tree that literally pops up in his backyard. He learns from a famous Indian `Guru' played by Cliff Curtis (Training Day, The Last Airbender) that with every word he says a leaf falls off this tree. When the leaves are gone, he dies. Yawn. But again, Eddie is an amazing physical talent and he just hasn't found his right material to match his talents in a long time. (See him in Dreamgirls - he was amazing).  There are literally some laugh outloud moments due to Eddie's performance, but he wasn't supported byt the direction of the movies important message.However there were great standout performance by some of the cast including Ruby Dee who plays his Alzheimer's diseased mother and Allison Janney his advertising firms boss.Way too simple, way to long and way to dull. The message of the movie is excellent and quite important in todays world - listening takes a lot of work and is most important in all relationships - but too bad the script wasn't better and the direction more dynamic.

No I did not feel like I was going to turn it off but I was not getting very amused either.  Some of what was supposed to be funny amounted more to Murphy's character making a fool of himself in a way that made my viewing experience awkward.  I actually felt embarrassed for the character.  There were some funny parts but the movie takes a turn into some very emotional tear-jerking territory that overshadows the comedy element.  Another reviewer compares this movie to Adam Saddler's ""Click"" effectively beating me to that comparison.  With a little editing, this film could easily be made into a Family Movie as it explores the elements of ""finding oneself"" and finding what really matters before it's too late - not necessarily actual death but losing out on what really matters but yet is taken for granted until it's gone, you know, the ages old ""You never know what you have until it's gone"".A pet-peeve of mine was the dumb Starbuck's Batista being a huge Beatles fan but even this becomes part of the emotional element of this movie when Jack McCall, who is normally 100% self-absorbed and not able to see a foot ahead of his own hide, is moved to find and buy an original pressing of the White Album on vinyl - possibly a pretty penny.  For McCall, this would be akin to ""Hell freezing over"".  As the few remaining leaves fall away, Jack is coming to value what he never gave as much a parting glance prior to the ""curse"".  We see how time wasted on petty things such as cutting ahead in a long line for coffee, fighting to keep the house of his dreams or not getting his car parked under a tree come back to haunt him and become sources of regret that may very well be etched in stone.  The tree ends up losing all of it's leaves.  Of course this has to be a funny movie with a happy ending.
