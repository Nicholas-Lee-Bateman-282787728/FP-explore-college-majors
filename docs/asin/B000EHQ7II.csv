972681,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B000EHQ7II,Get What We Give,"[11, 15]","12 Days of Terror is essentially a made-for-TV docu-drama that intends to captitalize on the consistent ratings buster ""Shark Week"" programs that Discovery Channel shows during sweeps a couple times a year. However, that doesn't make this film any less interesting or, a couple of times, emotionally charged.The docu-drama presents the basic facts of the very real, very strange shark attacks that took place on the Jersey shore in 1916, when several people were attacked by a shark (or sharks) and subsequently died as a result of the attacks. Since it had only been a few years previous that people began to actually take swims in the ocean, the fear that these events induced was very real and very damaging to the burgeoning seaside resorts. One of the more bizarre aspects to the attacks is the fact that apparently one or more sharks made their way up Mattewan creek ( a freshwater creek) and took the life of a small boy and then that of the boy's would-be rescuer. Then, later, the shark mutilated yet a second boy.12 Days of Terror stars former model/current TV soap opera hunk Colin Egglesfield as the lead in the film. Egglesfield will probably never win any acting awards, but this isn't a big budget film either. Egglesfield holds his own fairly well and isn't painfully bad, and at moments, even displays some thoughtful acting chops. Egglesfield, who is in just about every scene, is the emotional center of the film, and acts as ""Everyman"" in his reactions to the events that play out.The script is based on a book which documents the true tragic events on the Jersey shore during the summer of 1916. The storyline has been adjusted to make it a bit more cinematic and dramatic. It doesn't really hurt the story, but it does make it seem that certain people were involved more consistently than they were.Egglesfield's real life counterpart was certainly involved in two of the deaths, but beyond that he was not. The writers obviously wanted to create a linear lead for the film. The part of the fisherman (John Rhys-Davies) is a large supporting part, however, in reality, the fisherman only provided assistance when the shark was discovered in the creek. Rhys-Davies method of over-acting certainly balances Egglesfield's sub-acting.What would have made the film a bit more robust is more background information on the era itself. Modern audiences are often uninformed and quick to dismiss historic events because they don't know the ""why"" aspects of the situation. More emphasis on the naivete of the experts with regard to sharks would have really helped. Instead, we only see that the shark expert keeps attempting to interview our male lead to learn more about what actually happened. That isn't effective in demonstrating what was known or believed at the time - more information should be shown so that we can see the difference between what was believed 90 years ago by science and what even the lay swimmer knows today. That would have been effective.So...the film is not exactly true to the facts...does this make it a bad film? No. The acting isn't exactly stellar. Does that make it unwatchable? No. In fact, if anything, this film is more of a teaser, enticing the viewer to go out and read the book or at the very least to learn more about the actual events that took place that fateful summer of 1916.Worth your time if you are interested in some of the historical aspects of the events.",3,"Docu-drama that ""beefs up"" reality and tries to present the facts",1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,3420,"['12', 'Days', 'Terror', 'essentially', 'made-for-TV', 'docu-drama', 'captitalize', 'consistent', 'ratings', 'buster', 'Shark', 'Week', 'programs', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'sweeps', 'couple', 'year', 'However', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'less', 'interesting', 'couple', 'times', 'emotionally', 'charged.The', 'docu-drama', 'presents', 'basic', 'facts', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'strange', 'shark', 'attacks', 'took', 'place', 'Jersey', 'shore', '1916', 'when', 'several', 'people', 'were', 'attacked', 'shark', 'sharks', 'subsequently', 'died', 'result', 'attacks', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'few', 'years', 'previous', 'people', 'began', 'actually', 'take', 'swims', 'ocean', 'fear', 'events', 'induced', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'damaging', 'burgeoning', 'seaside', 'resorts', 'One', 'more', 'bizarre', 'aspects', 'attacks', 'fact', 'apparently', 'one', 'more', 'sharks', 'made', 'way', 'Mattewan', 'creek', 'freshwater', 'creek', 'took', 'life', 'small', 'boy', 'then', 'boy', 'would-be', 'rescuer', 'Then', 'later', 'shark', 'mutilated', 'yet', 'second', 'boy.12', 'Days', 'Terror', 'stars', 'former', 'model/current', 'TV', 'soap', 'opera', 'hunk', 'Colin', 'Egglesfield', 'lead', 'film', 'Egglesfield', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'win', 'acting', 'awards', ""n't"", 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'Egglesfield', 'own', 'fairly', 'well', ""n't"", 'painfully', 'bad', 'moments', 'even', 'thoughtful', 'acting', 'chops', 'Egglesfield', 'who', 'just', 'scene', 'emotional', 'center', 'film', 'Everyman', 'reactions', 'events', 'play', 'out.The', 'script', 'based', 'book', 'documents', 'true', 'tragic', 'events', 'Jersey', 'shore', 'summer', '1916', 'storyline', 'been', 'adjusted', 'make', 'bit', 'more', 'cinematic', 'dramatic', ""n't"", 'really', 'hurt', 'story', 'make', 'seem', 'certain', 'people', 'were', 'involved', 'more', 'consistently', 'were.Egglesfield', 'real', 'life', 'counterpart', 'was', 'certainly', 'involved', 'two', 'deaths', 'was', 'not', 'writers', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'create', 'linear', 'lead', 'film', 'part', 'fisherman', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'large', 'supporting', 'part', 'however', 'reality', 'fisherman', 'only', 'provided', 'assistance', 'when', 'shark', 'was', 'discovered', 'creek', 'Rhys-Davies', 'method', 'over-acting', 'certainly', 'Egglesfield', 'sub-acting.What', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'robust', 'more', 'background', 'information', 'era', 'Modern', 'audiences', 'are', 'often', 'uninformed', 'quick', 'dismiss', 'historic', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'aspects', 'situation', 'More', 'emphasis', 'naivete', 'experts', 'regard', 'sharks', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'helped', 'Instead', 'only', 'see', 'shark', 'expert', 'attempting', 'interview', 'male', 'lead', 'learn', 'more', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', ""n't"", 'effective', 'demonstrating', 'what', 'was', 'known', 'believed', 'time', 'more', 'information', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'difference', 'what', 'was', 'believed', '90', 'years', 'ago', 'science', 'what', 'even', 'lay', 'swimmer', 'today', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'effective.So', 'film', 'not', 'exactly', 'true', 'facts', 'make', 'bad', 'film', 'No', 'acting', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'stellar', 'make', 'unwatchable', 'fact', 'anything', 'film', 'more', 'teaser', 'enticing', 'viewer', 'go', 'out', 'read', 'book', 'very', 'least', 'learn', 'more', 'actual', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'fateful', 'summer', '1916.Worth', 'time', 'are', 'interested', 'historical', 'aspects', 'events']",12 Days of Terror

The truth is, almost all of these movies are unrealistic and we may or may not know it.  This dvd, 12 Days of Terror, is a docudrama about an actual event that occurred around 1916 by the New Jersey coast in which 5 shark attacks occurred around the space of 12 days and 4 of the 5 attacks were fatal.  These events inspired the novel Jaws which of course inspired the movie Jaws.  So indirectly, this movie about the actual events inspired the top selling fictional account of a great white shark terrorizing a beach community around New York.  I find this account more realistic and more believable.  In fact, the only parts of the movie that are fictional are the main character and his friend the boat captain.

972684,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B000EHQ7II,Julian Kennedy,"[0, 4]","12 Days of Terror: 5 out of 10: This is one strange film. A period piece Jaws taking place in Matawan NJ in 1916. (They actually do a nice job recreating the early nineteenth century Jersey shore line, except the boats are too modern.) I always have enjoyed a good (or even bad) shark attack movie. I always figured it was because of the fun munch the swimmer action. I never really thought about the T and A part of it. You know all those nice girls running around in their string bikinis or even less. Since 1916 female swimwear was apparently designed by the Taliban there is barely an ankle visible in the whole film. Funny how you don't miss the little things till they are gone.Creating an even bigger quandary is the surprising over the top homoerotic overtones throughout the entire film. Seriously not since Jeepers Creepers 2 have I seen more shirtless boys making googly eyes at each other. The two leads Colin Egglesfield and Mark Dexter are supposed to be in a love triangle with Jenna Harrison but the way these two carry on with each other that poor girl doesn't have a chance no matter whom she chooses. It's like Brokeback Beach Bingo.That aside this is Jaws by the numbers throwing out the actual historical facts and having our hero along with John Rhys-Davies (who apparently still will appear in any movie offered him.) go shark hunting with barrels and a crazy naturalist. (This along with the rundown ship having an inboard gasoline motor is needless to say ahistorical.) So if you like your Jaws slow paced, with a made for TV Merchant and Ivory feel and you prefer the first victim be a hunky guy in wet clingy cotton one-piece rather than a naked blonde girl. I have got your movie. I on the other hand am going to go watch a Ginger film to help clean my palate.",3,12 Days in OZ,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,1788,"['12', 'Days', 'Terror', '5', '10', 'one', 'strange', 'film', 'period', 'piece', 'Jaws', 'taking', 'place', 'Matawan', 'NJ', '1916', 'actually', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'recreating', 'early', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'Jersey', 'shore', 'line', 'boats', 'are', 'too', 'modern', 'always', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'good', 'even', 'bad', 'shark', 'attack', 'movie', 'always', 'figured', 'was', 'fun', 'munch', 'swimmer', 'action', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'T', 'A', 'part', 'know', 'nice', 'girls', 'running', 'around', 'string', 'bikinis', 'even', 'less', '1916', 'female', 'swimwear', 'was', 'apparently', 'designed', 'Taliban', 'barely', 'ankle', 'visible', 'whole', 'film', 'Funny', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'little', 'things', 'are', 'gone.Creating', 'even', 'bigger', 'quandary', 'surprising', 'top', 'homoerotic', 'overtones', 'entire', 'film', 'Seriously', 'not', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'shirtless', 'boys', 'making', 'googly', 'eyes', 'other', 'two', 'leads', 'Colin', 'Egglesfield', 'Mark', 'Dexter', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'love', 'triangle', 'Jenna', 'Harrison', 'way', 'two', 'carry', 'other', 'poor', 'girl', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'matter', 'whom', 'like', 'Brokeback', 'Beach', 'Bingo.That', 'Jaws', 'numbers', 'throwing', 'out', 'actual', 'historical', 'facts', 'having', 'hero', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'who', 'apparently', 'still', 'will', 'appear', 'movie', 'offered', 'go', 'shark', 'hunting', 'barrels', 'crazy', 'naturalist', 'rundown', 'ship', 'having', 'inboard', 'gasoline', 'motor', 'needless', 'say', 'ahistorical', 'So', 'like', 'Jaws', 'slow', 'paced', 'made', 'TV', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'feel', 'prefer', 'first', 'victim', 'be', 'hunky', 'guy', 'wet', 'clingy', 'cotton', 'one-piece', 'rather', 'naked', 'blonde', 'girl', 'have', 'got', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'am', 'going', 'go', 'watch', 'Ginger', 'film', 'help', 'clean', 'palate']",12 Days of Terror
972685,ARUOG7XQOA87X,B000EHQ7II,Kenneth Stratemeyer,"[2, 2]","I've been fascinated with sharks ever since I was eight years old.  A few years ago, I stumbled upon the book ""Twelve Days of Terror"" at a bargain book store.  I read it, and was very interested in the story.Then I found out there was a movie based on the book.  I bought it, not really expecting much, since I've seen some really bad shark movies.You know what?  Twelve Days of Terror is a very good movie.  Considering the budget, the movie was quite good.I felt the movie stayed true to the facts for the most part while adding some cinematic license for dramatic effect.  The movie ties all five 1916 shark attacks together very well.My only complaint.  The movie was too short.  I would have liked to see more of the ignorance of the period that was illustrated in the book.  In 1916, bathing in the ocean was fairly new.  People still didn't know much about sharks...in fact, they still don't.

The victims were Charles Vansant on 7/1/16; Charles Bruder on 7/6/16; Lester Stillwell and Stanley Fisher on 7/12/16. Joseph Dunn was also attacked on 7/12/16, but was the lone survivor.This movie is non-stop in the suspense and action. There is literally very little time to catch your breath and relax before the next attack takes place. There is an attack and death within the first 20 minutes of the movie! If that wouldn't grab your attention, I don't know what would! I found this movie held my attention from the beginning, and is worth watching again. I actually prefer this movie over Jaws, maybe because it's based on true events.The special effects in the movie are okay, at times looking like it was computer generated. You never get a good look at the wounds of those that have been attacked by the shark, but you get just enough of a glimpse to see the damage that was done, and why it was so devestating.The events of this movie are considered to be the inspiration for Peter Benchley's ""Jaws."" Scenes in this movie can be found to be similar to what Peter Benchley wrote in his book. For example, after the first death, a lifeguard named Alex tells people that the death was due to a shark attack, but was told it could have been done as a result of an errant torpedo from a German U-Boat. This is very similar to Jaws, when the girl dies, and Brody is initially told is was due to a shark attack, but then later told it was the result of a boating accident.A bonus feature states that a 7 1/2 foot Great White Shark was caught and found to have human remains inside of it, but there is speculation that it was actually a Bull Shark, and not a Great White.Skip Jaws, watch this instead!",4,Better than Jaws!,1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,1863,"['movie', 'tragic', 'story', 'how', '12', 'days', 'summer', '1916', 'New', 'Jersey', 'shark', 'attacked', 'killed', '4', 'people', 'maiming', 'fifth', 'victims', 'were', 'Charles', 'Vansant', '7/1/16', 'Charles', 'Bruder', '7/6/16', 'Lester', 'Stillwell', 'Stanley', 'Fisher', '7/12/16', 'Joseph', 'Dunn', 'was', 'also', 'attacked', '7/12/16', 'was', 'lone', 'survivor.This', 'movie', 'non-stop', 'suspense', 'action', 'literally', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'catch', 'breath', 'relax', 'next', 'attack', 'place', 'attack', 'death', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'grab', 'attention', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'would', 'found', 'movie', 'held', 'attention', 'beginning', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'actually', 'prefer', 'movie', 'Jaws', 'maybe', 'based', 'true', 'events.The', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'okay', 'times', 'looking', 'was', 'computer', 'generated', 'never', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'wounds', 'have', 'been', 'attacked', 'shark', 'get', 'just', 'enough', 'glimpse', 'see', 'damage', 'was', 'done', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'devestating.The', 'events', 'movie', 'are', 'considered', 'be', 'inspiration', 'Peter', 'Benchley', 'Jaws', 'Scenes', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'be', 'similar', 'what', 'Peter', 'Benchley', 'wrote', 'book', 'example', 'first', 'death', 'lifeguard', 'named', 'Alex', 'people', 'death', 'was', 'due', 'shark', 'attack', 'was', 'told', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'result', 'errant', 'torpedo', 'German', 'U-Boat', 'very', 'similar', 'Jaws', 'when', 'girl', 'Brody', 'initially', 'told', 'was', 'due', 'shark', 'attack', 'then', 'later', 'told', 'was', 'result', 'boating', 'accident.A', 'bonus', 'feature', '7', '1/2', 'foot', 'Great', 'White', 'Shark', 'was', 'caught', 'found', 'have', 'human', 'remains', 'speculation', 'was', 'actually', 'Bull', 'Shark', 'not', 'Great', 'White.Skip', 'Jaws', 'watch', 'instead']",12 Days of Terror

It captures the time, people and shark attacks of 1916 in New Jersey, except it takes place at one location (Matawan Creek) instead of three different places along the Jersey shore.  Other than that, it is great!  The setting and costumes look authentic and take you back in time, reminescent of Boardwalk Empire.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone that studies sharks.  I just finished reading Close to Shore, the book by Michael Capuzzo depicting the New Jersey shark attacks of 1916.

972698,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000EHQ7II,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 9]","Despite the all-too-familiar story about man-eating shark, ""12 Days of Terror"" tries to view the material from a different angle. The made-for-TV film uses the source material from the book of the same title written by Richard Fernicola, which reports the real-life events that happened in 1916 when people were attacked by a shark on the coast of New Jersey. The horrible attacks, which I think are now almost forgotten, influenced, it is said, Peter Benchley who wrote a book called `Jaws' much later.Colin Egglesfield plays Alex, a life guard on duty when a shark attacked the first victim on July 1, 1916. Though there is no possible cause of the fatal injury on the person, the authority is not wise to close the beach, fearing the massive panic and decline of the local economy that relies heavily on vacationers.Despite the too optimistic view of the Mayor, the attacks continue, killing people one after another. Alex decides to capture the killer shark with a help from a local fisherman (played by John Rhys-Davies).I must confess that I haven't read the book '12 Days of Terror,' but in spite of the obviously fictionalized part of the film such as dialogues exchanged between Alex and his former girlfriend, the filmed version seems to be trying to be as faithful as possible to what happened to the victims of the shark attack as far as its costumes and the set are concerned.And that is, I am afraid, exactly the weakness of the film. Many characters appear, including entrepreneur-minded animal trainer who is determined to catch the shark, but none of them is round and interesting enough to convince their authenticity. There is no scene-stealing Robert Shaw, and his memorable blackboard-scratching. Though the scenes of the shark attacks are competently done, giving some scary moments, the entire film seems at a loss about how to deal with the source material.The director is Jack Sholder probably best known his sci-fi thriller `Hidden.' Though Sholder shows his skills in the scenes of shark attacks, the film could have been more suspenseful with more dramatic development of the story and characters, and perhaps with more deaths. However, as the film insists on its historical accuracy, using archive footages and costumes, that is not an option. As you see in the film's title, everything must be solved within 12 days, and that is what you see in this film.The photography is beautiful, and the film is successful in giving occasional scares, but I couldn't help thinking about Steven Spielberg, who made drastic changes to the original book in making `Jaws.' I know the comparison is unfair, for Spielberg was dealing with a fiction, but it is also true that he knows what people want to see in this kind of film. '12 Days of Terror' tries to do something different, adding the historical truths to the format of the genre, which masterpieces like `Jaws' have already established. It is worthy attempt, but the marriage of history and shark attack is not a successful one.",3,(2.5 STARS) So-so B-Film Based on the 1916 New Jersey Shark Attack,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,3001,"['all-too-familiar', 'story', 'man-eating', 'shark', '12', 'Days', 'Terror', 'view', 'material', 'different', 'angle', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'source', 'material', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'written', 'Richard', 'Fernicola', 'real-life', 'events', 'happened', '1916', 'when', 'people', 'were', 'attacked', 'shark', 'coast', 'New', 'Jersey', 'horrible', 'attacks', 'think', 'are', 'now', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'influenced', 'said', 'Peter', 'Benchley', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'called', 'Jaws', 'much', 'later.Colin', 'Egglesfield', 'Alex', 'life', 'guard', 'duty', 'when', 'shark', 'attacked', 'first', 'victim', 'July', '1', '1916', 'possible', 'cause', 'fatal', 'injury', 'person', 'authority', 'not', 'wise', 'close', 'beach', 'fearing', 'massive', 'panic', 'decline', 'local', 'economy', 'heavily', 'vacationers.Despite', 'too', 'optimistic', 'view', 'Mayor', 'attacks', 'continue', 'killing', 'people', 'one', 'Alex', 'capture', 'killer', 'shark', 'help', 'local', 'fisherman', 'played', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', '.I', 'must', 'confess', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'Days', 'Terror', 'spite', 'obviously', 'fictionalized', 'part', 'film', 'such', 'dialogues', 'exchanged', 'Alex', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'filmed', 'version', 'be', 'trying', 'be', 'as', 'faithful', 'possible', 'what', 'happened', 'victims', 'shark', 'attack', 'as', 'far', 'costumes', 'set', 'are', 'concerned.And', 'am', 'afraid', 'exactly', 'weakness', 'film', 'Many', 'characters', 'appear', 'including', 'entrepreneur-minded', 'animal', 'trainer', 'who', 'determined', 'catch', 'shark', 'none', 'round', 'interesting', 'enough', 'convince', 'authenticity', 'scene-stealing', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'memorable', 'blackboard-scratching', 'scenes', 'shark', 'attacks', 'are', 'competently', 'done', 'giving', 'scary', 'moments', 'entire', 'film', 'loss', 'how', 'deal', 'source', 'material.The', 'director', 'Jack', 'Sholder', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'Hidden', 'Sholder', 'skills', 'scenes', 'shark', 'attacks', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'more', 'dramatic', 'development', 'story', 'characters', 'perhaps', 'more', 'deaths', 'However', 'film', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'using', 'archive', 'footages', 'costumes', 'not', 'option', 'see', 'film', 'title', 'everything', 'must', 'be', 'solved', '12', 'days', 'what', 'see', 'film.The', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'film', 'successful', 'giving', 'occasional', 'scares', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'who', 'made', 'drastic', 'changes', 'original', 'book', 'making', 'Jaws', 'know', 'comparison', 'unfair', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'dealing', 'fiction', 'also', 'true', 'what', 'people', 'want', 'see', 'kind', 'film', ""'12"", 'Days', 'Terror', 'tries', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'adding', 'historical', 'truths', 'format', 'genre', 'Jaws', 'have', 'already', 'established', 'worthy', 'attempt', 'marriage', 'history', 'shark', 'attack', 'not', 'successful', 'one']",12 Days of Terror
