In the mean time I have a DVD copy of the movie with Tony Randall, Barbara Eden, and Burl Ives  (1964, Harry Keller). I would like the other movie versions also.The story is simple but becomes complex. Mild mannered obscure architect Horace Ventimore (Tony Randall) is in love with Sylvia Kenton (Barbara Eden,&#8221; I Dream of Jeannie&#8221;). In an attempt to impress his potential father-in-law Professor Kenton (Edward Andrews), Horace purchases a KumKum (ancient brass bottle.) Upon opening it, you guess it a djinn, Fakrash (Burl Ives), pops out;  in his gratitude Fakrash helps Ventimore in a way you would not believe; neither did Ventimore.The story was slightly modified from the book but the modifications add to the plot.

I found my DVD working in perfect condition and understand others complaints, but this is something that will make you feel REAL GOOD every time you watch it... from beginning to end!Tony Randall is the &#34;average guy&#34; doing his best to make a good living, preparing to marry (with Barbara Eden) and meet her parents who are NOT very keen on Tony Randall's history as a former beatnik, but who cleaned up very nicely.  He is doing his best to charm them and acquires a brass bottle which he hopes to give as a gift to them since his potential father-in-law-to-be is very interested in other cultures and quite learned.  Let's just say the brass bottle ends up with Tony Randall who unseals it and release a genie (Burl Ives) who is so grateful to be released he insists on trying to make Tony Randall's life better, but consistently creates ever great havoc while you laugh at every turn.NOTE:  At the time of posting this, I noticed Amazon had their info wrong about the year of this film as they show 1969, but it's really 1964.  How else could Barbara Eden become the star of a 1965 sitcom if she made the movie after the show began?  Probably just a typo... NO biggie.
