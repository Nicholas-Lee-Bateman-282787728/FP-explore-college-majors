1395455,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B004BJMEPU,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 2]","UFC 123RAMPAGE VS MACHIDAI was so excited for this event when it was announced that it was unreal, I am sure any one who has read my reviews knows why. The answer of course is BJ Penn, my favorite fighter for sure. This event took place on November 20 2010 in Detroit Michigan, and it should also be noted that Jose Aldo was awarded the UFC Featherweight before the event since he was the last WEC Featherweight Champion.SpoilersDISC 11.GEORGE SOTIROPOULOS VS JOE LAUZON-the first round of this fight is simply amazing as both guys are really very good. Both put on a good showing but Joe gets the edge as he lands the better strikes and is on top more often and also sweeps George. The second round is less impressive for Joe as it seems like he just gassed after doing so well in that first round. After stuffing one take down attempt he is brought down and it is all George from there, he makes Joe tap to a kimura. This fight also won fight of the night I believe.2.PHIL DAVIS VS TIM BOETSCH-the first round in this one was good with a little feeling out process going on at first. But after that it is Davis who takes control in this fight. He gets on top of Tim and grinds him out the rest of the round using his superior wrestling. In the second round both wrestlers stay in the clinch until Davis gets him down. Tim locks in a guillotine choke but losses it and Davis sinks in the Mr. Wonderful submission to get the win. That of course is a submission he invented and it is a kimura that is locked on from behind the back, very interesting. Davis won the submission of the night for this fight.3.GERALD HARRIS VS MAIQUEL FALCAO-the first round here is slow moving to say the least until close to the end of the round. With a little over a minute left Falcao explodes on Harris and takes him down after a huge knee. He pounds on him and eventually gets a rear naked choke in, still Harris is saved by the bell. The second round is like the first but they get into it a little quicker, Falcao once again takes the round. The final round is basically nothing as they circle each other while throwing something every once in a while, Falcao wins by UD.4.BJ PENN VS MATT HUGHES-this of course was the fight that we were all looking forward to the most since we all love BJ. This is the rubber match between the two with each one winning one fight each prior to this. This fight was extremely EXCELLENT as BJ comes to the octagon looking like he is ready to destroy somebody, and he does just that. This was just perfect I almost went through the roof jumping up and down in excitement with my brother when BJ won this. This fight took only 21 seconds for BJ to knock Hughes out and he came right for him from the beginning. I would also like to point out that after this fight BJ trained with Hughes for his fight with Jon Fitch. Of course you know BJ won KO of the night.5.QUINTON JACKSON VS LYOTO MACHIDA-the main event that most thought would be perfect for Machida to come back on. Both of these guys were coming off losses and they were big losses in their respective careers. Rampage was coming off a loss to his bitter rival Rashad Evans while Lyoto was coming off a knock out loss to Mauricio Shogun Rua and losing the Light Heavyweight title. I of course have always been a Rampage fan since way back during KOTC and stuff but of course he became famous in Pride FC. The first round was a really good one with both guys implementing their game plans, Lyoto of course being elusive and jumping in and out and Rampage stalking him and cutting off the cage. There were some good shots landed but nothing devastating, Rampage wins the round on aggression and octagon control. The second round is very much like the first with both men doing well but Jackson being the aggressor, therefore I say he takes the second round as well. The final round was a little more action packed as not only Rampage landed some good shots but Lyoto stormed forward and rocked Jackson a little and took him down. The final round obviously goes to Lyoto but he losses by two rounds, still a great fight.This disc has he great Countdown show for this event, highly recommended.DISC 21.TYSON GRIFFIN VS NIK LENTZ-excellent first round between these two with take downs and submission attempts throughout the round. Both guys do a great job in the round offensively and defensively, good first round. The second round features a little more stand up with both guys landing some big shots. Nik lands some really good head kicks as well as some to the body. Tyson thought works for and gets take downs, close fight after two rounds. The last round is really hard to call as Griffin dominates in the first half while Nik rally's back and wins the second half of the round. That of course leads to the SD in which Nik gets the victory.2.PAUL KELLY VS TJ O'BRIEN-this is one of the best fights on the card as these guys give the fans a stand up war for most of the fight. The first round is a stand up contest with some good shots landed and some good movement. The second round is action packed with Kelly dropping TJ and eventually getting him in a mounted crucifix ended it by TKO.3.EDSON BARBOZA VS MIKE LULLO-this is another excellent fight and in this one you see both men's primary strengths. Lullo threatens from the bottom in this fight with a gogoplata which he almost gets. On the flip side during round one Edson showcases some excellent Maui Tai with some devastating leg kicks and some bombs. The second round is basically the same thing and just as exciting and the leg kicks start to really take their toll in this round. The third round does not even go into a minute as Lullo eats to many leg kicks and the ref stops it.4.KARO PARISYAN VS DENNIS HALLMAN-this fight does not make it out of the first round as Karo makes his return to the UFC. Still it was not going to be a good homecoming even though he controlled the fight at first on the cage. As soon as they were back in the center of the cage Karo got dropped and then pounded out.5.AARON SIMPSON VS MARK MUNOZ-wonderful fight right here as two friends go at it which makes the fight even better. The first round is full of great action from takedowns, slams, and some great strikes. The first round alone is great let alone the rest of the fight. The second round is great as well as the swing for the fences and prove to both be warriors putting on a great show for the fans. The third round is amazing as well just pure aggression form both guys with all kinds of bombs landing. There was of course the eye poke thing [you'll see] but other than that this was an excellent fight. Mark takes the UD.6.MATT BROWN VS BRIAN FOSTER-the first round of this fight like the last was amazing, the perfect MMA fight showcase. This fight has everything you could want in a fight and I do mean everything. It has a great stand battle with all kinds of strikes including some great kicks. There are all kinds of submissions and near endings, just perfect drama, there even some unintentional illegal blows. That is basically the first and second round all in a nut shell, in the second Foster sinks in a nice guillotine choke and gets the win.This disc has some excellent special features like an excellent behind the sces feature and of course the weigh in show as well as the UFC.com features [love them]. This was an excellent event with some of the best fights the company has seen.",5,BJ ALL DAY,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,7431,"['123RAMPAGE', 'VS', 'MACHIDAI', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'event',

1395458,A23LHYBAB2SXWC,B004BJMEPU,nin/ja77,"[0, 0]","UFC 123: Rampage vs Machida was an event in which two of the light heavyweight's could not afford to lose, knowing a win would put them back in title contention, however neither could afford to lose as both were coming of major loses. With Machida losing his title to Shogun Rua at UFC 113, while Rampage lost a number one contenders match against rival Rashad Evans at UFC 114. Would Rampage be able to figure out the puzzle that is Lyoto Machida's fighting style? This fight definitely has it's edge of seats moments but bascially both men are two afraid to commit and more worried about losing!!The Co main event and to some people the real main event is BJ Penn Vs Matt Hughes 3, with both men tied at one a piece this would settle the score, it also features BJ Penn's return to Welterweight and in much need of a win after losing his Lightweight title to Frankie Edgar(he would also lose the rematch), Hughes on the other hand is coming off a 3 fight win streak into this fight and a win here would put him back into title contention. The middleweight bout between newcomer Maiquel Falco and Maiquel Falco is a great fight and possibly should have got fight of the night, it also features a round that finishes 5 seconds to early!! Instead fight of the night went to George Sotiropoulos and Joe Lauzon, it features some entertaining moments with a lot of exchanges. The highly touted ""Mr Wonderful"" Phil Davis looks to extend his unbeaten streak against Tim Boetsch.As usual the two disc UFC DVD is crammed full of extras including the full Preliminary card, which includes a fight between Nik Lentz and Tyson Griffin and some of the worst judging you will ever witness.

1395459,A1FT7QFKNHL9DT,B004BJMEPU,Wolfe Moffat,"[0, 0]","People are allowed to have their expectations, but some people are really stupid! Does common sense need to come through for some people out there these days, even in the world of MMA? I think it does, because I really wasn't expecting KO, SUBMISSION, or FIGHT OF THE NIGHT in the Main Event for UFC 123. Now, it would've been nice to see Rampage pull off another KO like he had against Wanderlei Silva, and a performance like he had against Thiago Silva or Rashad Evans would've been ideal for Machida. Hey, it could've happened! But if we as MMA fans really decided to use our brains, even in a perfect MMA world, this fight probably wouldn't have been finished in 5 rounds. But that's MMA, and as a fan, sometimes you take those chances by CHOOSING to watch fights just like this. Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson and Lyoto ""The Dragon"" Machida, both former UFC Light Heavyweight Champions, square off in the Main Event for UFC 123.In the Co-Main Event you have a Grudge Match III between Matt Hughes and B.J. Penn, and both of them are smelling blood! At UFC 46, these 2 squared off for the first time, Penn shocking the world, and Matt Hughes, as he stepped into the Welterweight division to go for the title that Matt Hughes owned. And he did it, by rear-naked choke in the 1st round. At UFC 63, they went at it again, and after 2 hard rounds, Hughes got the best of Penn, pounding him out for a 3rd round TKO. That makes these guys 1-1. Who's getting the bragging rights?When it comes down to it, UFC 123 had mostly highs, but a moment or 2 where fans might have been scratching their heads. But we managed to get 11 fights out of UFC 123, mostly good ones, and I'll list 'em for you below!Tyson Griffin vs. Nik Lentz: I really don't think we'd ever see Tyson Griffin on such a skid. But that's exactly where we saw him coming into this fight. People weren't exactly lining up to see Nik Lentz fight, but to see Tyson Griffin beat him might be worth it. For good reason, there was a sore loser after a split decision was awarded. And despite who won the fight, Dana White refused to cut the man who lost.Paul Kelly vs. T.J. O'Brien: So, who remembers O'Brien from TUF? If you don't, then you might remember the first fight resulting in a 13 second KO...O'Brien was on the recieving end of that, courtesy of Marc Stevens, who never got a fight in the UFC. But O'Brien is getting his chance against Paul Kelly. This is pretty good, and ends with a 2nd round TKO.Edson Barboza vs. Mike Lullo: Both men are making their UFC debuts, both hoping to impress. One of them does with some devastating leg kicks, and takes this with a 3rd round TKO, largely due to those leg kicks. Impressive!Karo Parisyan vs. Dennis Hallman: As mad as he was at Karo, Dana White gave him a chance to get in there and prove that he belonged in the Octagon. Hallman needed to prove something too. Who would've ever seen a 1st round TKO coming in this? I didn't. WOW!Aaron Simpson vs. Mark Munoz: Two buddies willing to go at it. And they put on a great show while doing so! Unanimous decision, and I really enjoyed this one!Matt Brown vs. Brian Foster: The man I expected to win did win, but I expected a big KO. Instead, he showed off a nice submission in the 2nd round!George Sotiropoulos vs. Joe Lauzon: Both of these guys love to bring it, and both of them are ready to rumble as they take FIGHT OF THE NIGHT! And one of them takes a 2nd round submission!Phil Davis vs. Tim Boetsch: Both of these guys have wrestled, as the one of them boasted in pre-fight. But one of them really wasn't in this fight much at all. The other one dominated, and pulled off an incredible submission in the 2nd! SUBMISSION OF THE NIGHT was well-earned for this man!Gerald Harris vs. Maiquel Falcao: With Harris on his first Main Card taking on a crazy Brazilian, I expected this to be CRAZY! Oh, it was crazy, all right! It was crazy, due to a time clock stunt, but it was incredibly boring, for the most part. Unanimous decision. If these guys make it back to the UFC, cool. But they need to put on a show!Matt Hughes vs. B.J. Penn III: Well, the trilogy ended as quickly as it began, because one man landed right on the button for KNOCK OUT OF THE NIGHT! It was a quick one, I'll give him that, but this 3-fight legacy will always be one to remember, and Penn and Hughes will always have my props for making waves, not to mention some amazing performances in the UFC!!!Rampage Jackson vs. Lyoto Machida: Is it just me, or did the reaction on the winner's face make anybody else laugh? But he had that reaction on his face, because he told Joe Rogan, ""Man, I just got my ass WHOOPED!"" In the end, this was somewhat of a chess match, and it ended with a split decision. But seriously, what was everybody expecting with this one?!!?You can laugh, you can cry, you can even bitch all you want about how this ruined your whole night. Or, you can actually admit that there were some good fights worth watching again on this card. I can actually say that. But hey, not everybody is looking to keep it real. Feel how you want to feel, because I enjoyed this card!",4,"So, You Mean To Tell Me That People Expected A Highlight Reel KO In The Main Event? HA!!!
