Tom Berenger is a detective who is assigned to guard a Manhattan socialite after she witnesses the death of a friend.

510181,A31YZPP738T2EB,B00000K3TU,"Dustin Dunaway ""Cool Channel Films""","[26, 27]","This movie somehow got overlooked in theatres, but there's no need to miss it now.Long story short: Rich socialite Mimi Rogers witnesses a mob hit and thus becomes a target.  Tom Berenger is a blue-collar cop assigned to protect her.  He is attracted to her, but is married (to Lorraine Bracco, playing the same character she always played before The Sopranos).  Complicating matters is that she is attracted to him and the intense situation is constantly pushing them together.What sets ""Someone..."" apart from other movies with similar plots is that Bracco's character is pretty sympathetic so it's not a cut-and-dried issue.  Berenger is drawn to Rogers because she is a vulnerable woman who needs protection.  Bracco's character is a strong, independent Brooklynite who can challenge him in the relationship, but can't provide the one thing he needs (a chance to be needed).  High-concept stuff when you think about it.All of this romance is sandwiched in between a pretty good thriller as Berenger attempts to protect Rogers from some very bad guys.  The thriller-story is what the movie was sold on and it succeeds on that level.The DVD offers some good extras, but nothing inventive.Don't miss this one a second time.",4,Good Date Movie.,1020124800,"04 30, 2002",2002,1224,"['movie', 'somehow', 'got', 'overlooked', 'theatres', 'need', 'miss', 'now.Long', 'story', 'short', 'Rich', 'socialite', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'mob', 'hit', 'thus', 'target', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'blue-collar', 'cop', 'assigned', 'protect', 'attracted', 'married', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'always', 'played', 'Sopranos', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'attracted', 'intense', 'situation', 'constantly', 'pushing', 'Someone', 'apart', 'other', 'movies', 'similar', 'plots', 'Bracco', 'character', 'pretty', 'sympathetic', 'not', 'cut-and-dried', 'issue', 'Berenger', 'drawn', 'Rogers', 'vulnerable', 'woman', 'who', 'protection', 'Bracco', 'character', 'strong', 'independent', 'Brooklynite', 'who', 'can', 'challenge', 'relationship', 'ca', ""n't"", 'provide', 'one', 'thing', 'chance', 'be', 'needed', 'High-concept', 'stuff', 'when', 'think', 'it.All', 'romance', 'sandwiched', 'pretty', 'good', 'thriller', 'Berenger', 'attempts', 'protect', 'Rogers', 'very', 'bad', 'guys', 'thriller-story', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'sold', 'level.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'extras', 'nothing', 'inventive.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'second', 'time']",N/A

Infidelity in movies or real life depresses me, but hey, without it there would be no movie. mike's inner torment is what makes this great. He wants to do the right thing but he just cannot stay away from Claire and her world that is so different than his. I can think of few times in movies when I have seen that kind of electricity as the very first time mike sees Claire. Wow. The sexual tension builds beautifully and of course culminates. I wish we had been able to see a liitle more sex scene. I mean, we cut from the first kiss to him fully dressed and kissing her goodbye. After that all we ever get is them in bed but they are sleeping or he is thinking or whatever. I am not saying I wanted porn. But just a little more action...they were so sexy and cute together in large part because of their different worlds.  The slow dancing scene at the end...Yowza. Now THAT was sexy with all clothes on.  They clearly had feelings for each other still. He looked like he was about to cry. So tender. Yes yes I swoon for the old Tom Berenger. I even thought sgt.

510183,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B00000K3TU,Israel Drazin,"[1, 1]","The plot in this film has been used many times with small variations that make it worthwhile to watch: a poor, good looking detective from a nice warm family with an adoring wife is assigned to watch and protect a beautiful, rich woman, and the two fall in love. Tom Berringer is the man in this movie, Mini Rogers the socialite, Loraine Bracco the wife, and the late Jerry Orbach from Law and Order is Tom's lieutenant, unfortunately without his trademark Law and Order wisecracks.In this 1987 version of the oft-told plot, a socialite sees a brutal gangster knife a man and says she can identify him. Orbach orders Berringer to ""baby sit her,"" which includes being at her house at night while she is in bed. Berringer lives with his charming wife and outgoing, smiling son in a run-down house in a bad and dangerous neighborhood. The socialite's house is larger than a mansion. She is beautiful. The gangster finds a way to get to her and threatens her, but she nevertheless identifies him in a lineup. But he is released because Berringer did not read him the Miranda warning. The socialite is outraged, screams at Berringer, they kiss, and sleep together. When he returns home, he finds two police officers; his wife heard a prowler outside during the night.Berringer's wife suspects what is happening to her husband and throws him out of their run-down home when she sees him wearing a tie that the socialite bought him and hearing him begin to complain about her New York accent, which he enjoyed during their sixteen year marriage.The problems heat up when the gangster sends a henchman to the socialite's mansion to kill her, and reaches a boiling point when the gangster goes to Berringer's home, holds his wife and son captive, and insists that Berringer come home alone. But the socialite goes with him.Viewers will find it interesting to watch the violence at the mansion when the henchman creeps in to kill the socialite, and the ferocity at Berringer's home and how his wife and son act. They will also be fascinated watching what happens to the gangster, Berringer, his wife, his son, and the socialite.",5,An exiting version of an oft-told tale,1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,2118,"['plot', 'film', 'been', 'used', 'many', 'times', 'small', 'variations', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'poor', 'good', 'looking', 'detective', 'nice', 'warm', 'family', 'adoring', 'wife', 'assigned', 'watch', 'protect', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'woman', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'Tom', 'Berringer', 'man', 'movie', 'Mini', 'Rogers', 'socialite', 'Loraine', 'Bracco', 'wife', 'late', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'Law', 'Order', 'Tom', 'lieutenant', 'unfortunately', 'trademark', 'Law', 'Order', 'wisecracks.In', '1987', 'version', 'oft-told', 'plot', 'socialite', 'brutal', 'gangster', 'knife', 'man', 'can', 'identify', 'orders', 'Berringer', 'baby', 'sit', 'being', 'house', 'night', 'bed', 'Berringer', 'charming', 'wife', 'outgoing', 'smiling', 'son', 'run-down', 'house', 'bad', 'dangerous', 'neighborhood', 'socialite', 'house', 'larger', 'mansion', 'beautiful', 'gangster', 'way', 'get', 'nevertheless', 'lineup', 'released', 'Berringer', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'Miranda', 'warning', 'socialite', 'outraged', 'screams', 'Berringer', 'kiss', 'sleep', 'together', 'When', 'home', 'two', 'police', 'officers', 'wife', 'heard', 'prowler', 'night.Berringer', 'wife', 'what', 'happening', 'husband', 'run-down', 'home', 'when', 'wearing', 'tie', 'socialite', 'bought', 'hearing', 'begin', 'complain', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'enjoyed', 'sixteen', 'year', 'marriage.The', 'problems', 'heat', 'up', 'when', 'gangster', 'henchman', 'socialite', 'mansion', 'kill', 'boiling', 'point', 'when', 'gangster', 'Berringer', 'home', 'wife', 'son', 'captive', 'Berringer', 'come', 'home', 'alone', 'socialite', 'him.Viewers', 'will', 'find', 'interesting', 'watch', 'violence', 'mansion', 'when', 'henchman', 'kill', 'socialite', 'ferocity', 'Berringer', 'home', 'how', 'wife', 'son', 'act', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'fascinated', 'watching', 'what', 'gangster', 'Berringer', 'wife', 'son', 'socialite']",N/A
510184,ASLVBGA9Z1Y63,B00000K3TU,"Janice Harrison ""Janice""","[0, 0]","Tom Berenger is sensational in this romantic thriller movie from director Ridley Scott.  He plays Mike Keegan, a newly promoted detective, who is given the assignment of (as the police put it)""babysitting"" the witness to a brutal murder.  The witness, Claire Gregory, played to the hilt by Mimi Rogers, is beautiful, classy and well-educated.  She's especially upset because she's just seen a close friend get stabbed to death. These actors have real screen chemistry (it's not forced) which makes the movie work.  While Mike Keegan is attracted to Claire from the minute he sees her, he tries to keep those feelings at bay and just be professional. However, the more time he spends with her, the harder that becomes. Lorraine Bracco is one tough cookie and does a wonderful job of playing a police officer's wife. The ""perp"", played by Andreas Katsulas, is really scary; he does a great job playing a psychopathic killer.  All in all, a very talented cast, great plot with suspense and a taut feeling throughout really combine to make this an outstanding movie.

It's really a shame that he lost his talent to low rent action films when he could've continued with films like this.  The atmosphere and cinemotography, as well as the soundtrack featuring liscensed (?) music really contributes to the overall mood, which is kind of casual and realistic.

510188,A1B83BCGRJRZJ4,B00000K3TU,Kenneth Hand,"[5, 7]","All right, this is a bit of a difficult film to review, because while I enjoyed it, I can't decide whether I would actually want to be bothered to watch it again -- and that usually defines a great movie, for me.  But I'll do my best and we'll see where we go.To sum up the plot, Tom Berenger plays Mike, a happily married (sexy) police detective who's hired to protect Claire (Mimi Rogers), a rich woman who's witnessed a murder.  Predictably, perhaps, Claire and Mike fall in love, and as Mike's marriage begins to fall apart, the murderer steps up his pursuit of Claire in an attempt to find and destroy her...Okay, okay, so it's a bit of an average plot, from the sounds of it.  But the complexity of the storyline and the decent character developments kept me watching.  I actually disliked all the of the performances of the principal actors, but they were probably the only actors for the parts and for each other in this movie.  I like how Mimi Rogers's character likes opera, it gives her this artsy, deep dynamic, but all in all, I wasn't that convinced that her character actually develops beyond ""learning not to fall in love with bodyguards.""  The same goes for the others.  It's like the plot moves along, but the characters don't quite go with it.Nonetheless!  The actors aren't HORRIBLE, the plot is decent, and Tom Berenger is one hot bodyguard.  Mimi Rogers DOES get the helpless victim act across well, and the set, costumes, etc. are terrific.  The suspense is suspenseful.  The movie will keep you interested.One of the other reviewers of this movie wrote that 'Someone to Watch Over Me' is a good date movie.  It is.  It's definitely worth watching, if you're on a stay-in date, or just in need of a decent movie to kill time, and after watching it you'll feel that the two hours wasn't wasted.

510195,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00000K3TU,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","Ridley Scott's fourth film has always been a favorite of mine.  A guilty pleasure I guess although I see where it is now at 82% at ""Rotten Tomatoes"".  The general audience never warmed up to it and I'm not sure why.  The movie grabbed me from the opening scene, scanning the tall monuments of New York City at dusk while Sting sings the title song over the credits.  This is one of 4 version of the song in the film if I'm not mistaken, including the proper coda over the closing credits performed by Roberta Flack.While we're on the subject, STWOM has a varied soundtrack ranging from the several versions of the Gershwins' beautiful song to Steve Winwood's ""Freedom Overspill"" to Christmas themed chamber music to opera arias that have now become common place.  I'm pretty sure this film is where I first heard music from Catalani's ""La Wally"" and ""Vien Mallika"" by Delibes, now staples on my MP3 player.  The filmmakers do a wonderful job placing the music over the proper scene and it adds significantly to the effect.This is probably the first time I saw the gorgeous architectural creation know as the Guggenheim Museum where it is the setting for a chase sequence.  Not the last time either.  Tom Berenger is perfectly suited as the cop from Queens assigned to nighttime duty to protect a beautiful eyewitness (a stone cold gorgeous Mimi Rogers) to a brutal murder.  Claire (Rogers) is filthy rich and has a multi-million dollar Park Ave. apartment.  Michael (Berenger) is clearly wowed by Claire's sophistication, intellect and beauty not to mention her surroundings and influence.  This is a different world.  There is a scene where Mike and his saucy wife Ellie (terrific Lorraine Bracco) are looking out from their humble home in Queens toward the Manhattan skyline.  If only.Happily married though he is, Michael comes under the spell of the forbidden fruit that is Claire.  The sets of her apartment are perfectly toned in browns, beiges, tans, egg shell whites and creams.  A sense of calm, that Mike's usually hurried life denies him.  Claire is rich, beautiful and available.  Yes, I'm sucked in too.  The film doesn't minimize the thriller aspect either.  Claire is set upon by the killer and his henchmen more than once.  There is an intense scene in the final act that adds to ultimate conclusion.  ""Someone To Watch Over Me"" remains a great blend of drama, romance and modern film noir.",5,A great hidden treasure,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,2406,"['Ridley', 'Scott', 'fourth', 'film', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'guess', 'see', 'where', 'now', '82', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'general', 'audience', 'never', 'warmed', 'up', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'movie', 'grabbed', 'opening', 'scene', 'scanning', 'tall', 'monuments', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'dusk', 'Sting', 'sings', 'title', 'song', 'credits', 'one', '4', 'version', 'song', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'including', 'proper', 'coda', 'closing', 'credits', 'performed', 'Roberta', 'Flack.While', ""'re"", 'subject', 'STWOM', 'varied', 'soundtrack', 'ranging', 'several', 'versions', 'Gershwins', 'beautiful', 'song', 'Steve', 'Winwood', 'Freedom', 'Overspill', 'Christmas', 'themed', 'chamber', 'music', 'opera', 'arias', 'have', 'now', 'become', 'common', 'place', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'film', 'where', 'first', 'heard', 'music', 'Catalani', 'La', 'Wally', 'Vien', 'Mallika', 'Delibes', 'now', 'MP3', 'player', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'placing', 'music', 'proper', 'scene', 'significantly', 'effect.This', 'probably', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'gorgeous', 'architectural', 'creation', 'know', 'Guggenheim', 'Museum', 'where', 'setting', 'chase', 'sequence', 'Not', 'last', 'time', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'cop', 'Queens', 'assigned', 'nighttime', 'duty', 'protect', 'beautiful', 'eyewitness', 'stone', 'cold', 'gorgeous', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'brutal', 'murder', 'Claire', 'Rogers', 'filthy', 'rich', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'Park', 'Ave.', 'apartment', 'Michael', 'Berenger', 'clearly', 'wowed', 'Claire', 'sophistication', 'intellect', 'beauty', 'not', 'mention', 'surroundings', 'influence', 'different', 'world', 'scene', 'where', 'Mike', 'saucy', 'wife', 'Ellie', 'terrific', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'are', 'looking', 'humble', 'home', 'Queens', 'Manhattan', 'skyline', 'only.Happily', 'married', 'Michael', 'spell', 'forbidden', 'fruit', 'Claire', 'sets', 'apartment', 'are', 'perfectly', 'toned', 'browns', 'beiges', 'tans', 'egg', 'shell', 'whites', 'creams', 'sense', 'calm', 'Mike', 'usually', 'hurried', 'life', 'Claire', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'available', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'sucked', 'too', 'film', ""n't"", 'minimize', 'thriller', 'aspect', 'Claire', 'set', 'killer', 'henchmen', 'more', 'once', 'intense', 'scene', 'final', 'act', 'ultimate', 'conclusion', 'Someone', 'Watch', 'Me', 'great', 'blend', 'drama', 'romance', 'modern', 'film', 'noir']",N/A
