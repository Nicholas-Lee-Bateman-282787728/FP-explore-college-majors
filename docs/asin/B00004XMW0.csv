556565,A3S5C7Y0WT2Q9N,B00004XMW0,J. Lizzi,"[16, 18]","There's little doubt that Yngwie Malmsteen is one of the most impressive guitar soloists in the hard rock genre, and his soloing prowess is certainly on display in this live concert DVD, recorded in Brazil in May of 1998.  On pure musicianship alone, I'd be inclined to rate this performance a little higher, but the musical aspects of this show were too often overshadowed by bad production work that turned out to be far too often irritating.The good news is that, aside from a decent helping of power rock songs, the viewer (read guitar fan) gets lots of close-ups of Yngwie's finger work, although usually it's either one hand or the other, but not both, for any length of time.  At least there are many opportunities to check out his amazing left hand dexterity, which is made easier by the custom scalloped fret board on Yngwie's Stratocaster.  In fact, Yngwie's soloing is blindingly fast virtually all the time, and I'm amazed at how often he plays inward of the twelfth fret.  As impressive as this may seem to some, I longed for a little more diversity in the soloing; thus, I got bored at times.  [Note:  I'm way spoiled by Joe Satriani, whom I consider to be the ultimate rock guitar soloist based on his varied finger style and diverse phrasing.  You must check out his 2-DVD live performance].  Yngwie also has this habit of slinging the axe around his body, and throwing the guitar up in the air repeatedly at the end of songs.  Perhaps he does this a little too often . . .I don't get heartburn over a minor sound glitch here or there, but on several of the songs, virtually the entire audio balance shifted to the center speaker, and I had to toggle my receiver to a ""CD Stereo"" setting (from 7.1) to resurrect the concert sound.  About halfway through, I got tired of doing this, and totally gave up on 7.1.  I can't be sure if this is a trait of this disc, or if mine was the odd defective one.  Beware.Just as annoying as the 7.1 sound disappearance was the video editing.  The overall run time of just under 80 minutes (12 songs) is somewhat unfulfilling, but what really made me feel shortchanged was that the editing makes it painfully obvious that much of Yngwie's performance seemed to be cut out.  I mean, here you see him walking off stage, and the next moment he's already started playing again:  different lighting, and a hiccup in the audio track and camera angle.  This frequent absence of flow between songs (in fact, the track number gets derailed at one point) ruined the concert ""feel"" of the performance.All things considered, this DVD provides a slightly above average rock `n' roll experience.",3,Good concert marred by sound glitches and horrible editing,1062633600,"09 4, 2003",2003,2631,"['little', 'doubt', 'Yngwie', 'Malmsteen', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'guitar', 'soloists', 'hard', 'rock', 'genre', 'soloing', 'prowess', 'certainly', 'display', 'live', 'concert', 'DVD', 'recorded', 'Brazil', 'May', '1998', 'pure', 'musicianship', 'alone', ""'d"", 'be', 'inclined', 'rate', 'performance', 'little', 'higher', 'musical', 'aspects', 'show', 'were', 'too', 'often', 'overshadowed', 'bad', 'production', 'work', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'irritating.The', 'good', 'news', 'aside', 'decent', 'helping', 'power', 'rock', 'songs', 'viewer', 'read', 'guitar', 'fan', 'lots', 'close-ups', 'Yngwie', 'finger', 'work', 'usually', 'one', 'hand', 'other', 'not', 'length', 'time', 'least', 'are', 'many', 'opportunities', 'check', 'out', 'amazing', 'left', 'hand', 'dexterity', 'made', 'easier', 'custom', 'scalloped', 'fret', 'board', 'Yngwie', 'Stratocaster', 'fact', 'Yngwie', 'soloing', 'blindingly', 'fast', 'virtually', 'time', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'how', 'often', 'inward', 'twelfth', 'fret', 'As', 'impressive', 'may', 'seem', 'longed', 'little', 'more', 'diversity', 'soloing', 'thus', 'got', 'bored', 'times', '[', 'Note', ""'m"", 'way', 'spoiled', 'Joe', 'Satriani', 'whom', 'consider', 'be', 'ultimate', 'rock', 'guitar', 'soloist', 'based', 'varied', 'finger', 'style', 'diverse', 'phrasing', 'must', 'check', 'out', '2-DVD', 'live', 'performance', ']', 'Yngwie', 'also', 'habit', 'slinging', 'axe', 'body', 'throwing', 'guitar', 'up', 'air', 'repeatedly', 'end', 'songs', 'Perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'often', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'heartburn', 'over', 'minor', 'sound', 'glitch', 'here', 'there', 'several', 'songs', 'virtually', 'entire', 'audio', 'balance', 'shifted', 'center', 'speaker', 'had', 'toggle', 'receiver', 'CD', 'Stereo', 'setting', '7.1', 'resurrect', 'concert', 'sound', 'halfway', 'got', 'tired', 'doing', 'totally', 'gave', 'up', '7.1', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure', 'trait', 'disc', 'mine', 'was', 'odd', 'defective', 'one', 'Beware.Just', 'as', 'annoying', '7.1', 'sound', 'disappearance', 'was', 'video', 'editing', 'overall', 'run', 'time', 'just', '80', 'minutes', '12', 'songs', 'somewhat', 'unfulfilling', 'what', 'really', 'made', 'feel', 'shortchanged', 'was', 'editing', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'much', 'Yngwie', 'performance', 'seemed', 'be', 'cut', 'out', 'mean', 'here', 'see', 'walking', 'off', 'stage', 'next', 'moment', 'already', 'started', 'playing', 'again', 'different', 'lighting', 'hiccup', 'audio', 'track', 'camera', 'angle', 'frequent', 'absence', 'flow', 'songs', 'fact', 'track', 'number', 'derailed', 'one', 'point', 'ruined', 'concert', 'feel', 'performance.All', 'things', 'considered', 'DVD', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'experience']",N/A

The visual quality of this DVD concert is really good, but at times rather cheesy. As for the audio, it is really something to be desired. Not only is it mixed at a terribly low volume, but I can't even hear a seperation within the instruments. I can't believe what I heard. My dad and I recorded a song using a small mic and an MD recorder and it sounds a million times better than this DVD! How can a small mic and MD recorder sound better than the audio mix on this DVD? The answer is quite simple...we have better equipment. In closing, this DVD is a HUGE disappointment.
