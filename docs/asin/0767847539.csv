22217,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,0767847539,D. Mok,"[6, 8]","Yet another music-video-style director at the helm of this one.  Nick Hurran saturates this charming (though obviously derivative) comedy with so  many oh-so-hip jump cuts, voice-overs, superimpositions and post-modern  techniques that it got me cynical about the whole movie about five minutes  in.But Virtual Sexuality succeeds at least in part, due to one of the  most old-fashioned of assets:  Performances.  Laura Fraser shines in both  sensitivity and comedy as Justine (third-billed, inexplicably, though she  carries the film), the lonely and frustrated teen desperate for romance.  Fraser's incredibly expressive performance is what elevates his movie.  In  the quieter moments, when Hurran thankfully reins in his hyperactive  directorial hand, the shifts in emotion in Justine's face are marvellous --  when Justine is conflicted about having to destroy the dream man she  herself created, or when she wants to apologize to Chas (Luke DeLacey,  adequate in the usual nice-geek role) for having ripped into him earlier,  it's a real moment of heart.  And Fraser is nicely balanced by the great  comic timing of hunk Rupert Penry-Jones, whose performance as  woman-in-man's-body Jake is wonderful (watch his postures as he moseys  around Chas' room).Hurran's heavyhanded music-video techniques, gross  overuse of music (including that godawful cover of Labelle's &quot;Lady  Marmalade&quot; by, if I heard correctly, All Saints) and hipper-than-thou  tone hurt this movie.  But in the end, the beautiful interaction of actors  saves this movie.",3,Mix of great acting turns and too-hip execution.,968371200,"09 8, 2000",2000,1553,"['Yet', 'music-video-style', 'director', 'helm', 'one', 'Nick', 'Hurran', 'charming', 'obviously', 'derivative', 'comedy', 'so', 'many', 'oh-so-hip', 'jump', 'cuts', 'voice-overs', 'superimpositions', 'post-modern', 'techniques', 'got', 'cynical', 'whole', 'movie', 'five', 'minutes', 'in.But', 'Virtual', 'Sexuality', 'least', 'part', 'due', 'one', 'most', 'old-fashioned', 'assets', 'Performances', 'Laura', 'Fraser', 'shines', 'sensitivity', 'comedy', 'Justine', 'third-billed', 'inexplicably', 'film', 'lonely', 'frustrated', 'teen', 'desperate', 'romance', 'Fraser', 'incredibly', 'expressive', 'performance', 'what', 'movie', 'quieter', 'moments', 'when', 'Hurran', 'thankfully', 'hyperactive', 'directorial', 'hand', 'shifts', 'emotion', 'Justine', 'face', 'are', 'marvellous', 'when', 'Justine', 'conflicted', 'having', 'destroy', 'dream', 'man', 'created', 'when', 'apologize', 'Chas', 'Luke', 'DeLacey', 'adequate', 'usual', 'nice-geek', 'role', 'having', 'ripped', 'earlier', 'real', 'moment', 'heart', 'Fraser', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'great', 'comic', 'timing', 'hunk', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'performance', ""woman-in-man's-body"", 'Jake', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'postures', 'around', 'Chas', 'room', '.Hurran', 'heavyhanded', 'music-video', 'techniques', 'gross', 'overuse', 'music', 'including', 'godawful', 'cover', 'Labelle', 'quot', 'Lady', 'Marmalade', 'quot', 'heard', 'correctly', 'Saints', 'hipper-than-thou', 'tone', 'hurt', 'movie', 'end', 'beautiful', 'interaction', 'actors', 'saves', 'movie']",N/A
22218,A342AZPTC0QE57,0767847539,Gaz,"[5, 11]","My first observation is that a lot of your 4/5 star reviews of Virtual Sexuality are from american viewers. All I can assume is you have a slightly tainted view of British humour, and assume this garbage passes as decent movie fair here in Blighty. It doesn't.Justine. A weak character on whom the basis is thankfully rarely placed, her only motivation is that at 17 (if she or any of the rest of the cast is really 17 then this is a 5 star film) she has yet to lose her virginity. Incapable of finding her ""Bar-Code""/Perfect Man, she inadvertantly creates him in a ludicrous virtual reality booth thing that, once the building around it explodes, is creates in the flesh the being she's composed (well, as you do). Sure. I'll swallow that.What follows is a lame ""girl becomes man"" story, as Justine gets used to being ""Jake"" (the excuse for the full frontal nudity that earns the film its' 18 rating). The characters are thankfully limited - Chas, the nerd we KNOW will get Justine; Fran, Justine's friend who is off screen for most of the film; Alex, the token brainless football jock who thinks he's it; Hoover, the resident man-magnet; Justine and Jake of course; and two scientists, intent on getting Jake back for some ""tests."" It's difficult to care about any of them, or anything they do, as it's all so vague and dragged out (and very boring) until the film's eventual ""everything's sorted out with cheerful ease and all is alright again"" ending. Things are literally sorted with the touch of a button... so what was all the fuss about? Is Jake really linked to Justine? Why do they feel eachother's pain? Did Jake and Hoover have sex, or is Jake gay as presumably his feelings for Chas prompted Justine's? Tons of questions, none answered. It's never even very funny, assuming I wasn't asleep when the jokes were made. The plot is true second rate stuff, armed with a single twist (Jake is not Justine, but was created out of thin air instead, and simply has a copy of her consciousness and memories...?) and is dragged over too long a running time. The music isn't inspirational. The directing isn't anything fresh. Hell, the cast aren't much to write home about, with some shaky motivations and bad lines. It's just hard to care about any of it, and more importantly minus it's nude scenes, it seems an almost audience-less semi-chick flick, that's never exceptionally rude or adventurous, or fresh in any way.Truly a dire and tedious film, without any real merit or fun to be had.

What I got was a wry, funny, and unexpected movie more than willing to poke fun at itself for the silly premise.  Rather than a Pygmailion-like story of a creation come to life, this movie was more about understanding both sides of the gender line.When Justine becomes Jake, her computer designed fantasy bloke, she gets (or has) to go places always barred to her before, and to puzzle out the mystery of what makes a bloke tick.  Trailing along with Chas, Justine's computer-geek-next-door, Jake ventures onto the basketball court, into the locker room (yike!!!) and even onto the dance floor with Hoover (guess why she got the nickname).This movie is hilarious, and well worth watching as the clueless and shallow Justine gets a good idea of what life and love are all about, both as a guy and a girl.",4,Not what you exected...,1030147200,"08 24, 2002",2002,943,"['read', 'description', 'back', 'box', 'was', 'looking', 'stupid', 'pointless', 'thoroughly', 'predictable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'wry', 'funny', 'unexpected', 'movie', 'more', 'willing', 'poke', 'fun', 'silly', 'premise', 'Rather', 'Pygmailion-like', 'story', 'creation', 'come', 'life', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'understanding', 'sides', 'gender', 'line.When', 'Justine', 'Jake', 'computer', 'designed', 'fantasy', 'bloke', 'go', 'places', 'always', 'barred', 'before', 'puzzle', 'out', 'mystery', 'what', 'bloke', 'tick', 'Trailing', 'Chas', 'Justine', 'computer-geek-next-door', 'Jake', 'ventures', 'basketball', 'court', 'locker', 'room', 'yike', 'even', 'dance', 'floor', 'Hoover', 'guess', 'why', 'got', 'nickname', '.This', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'clueless', 'shallow', 'Justine', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'life', 'love', 'are', 'guy', 'girl']",N/A

There, she finds her way to a virtual reality make-over exhibit where she takes the scan of her body and by way of fiddling with the controls makes the image of her dream man.  Outside the convention, there's a gas-line explosion and the tech convention is mostly destroyed.  When she emerges from the VR make-over exhibit, she finds she's become the dream man she created.  The rest of the movie is a fun and silly tale of her/him adjusting to her 'new you' and trying to figure out how to get back to how she was.Don't expect any deep plot or fast-paced-thrills or anything like that.

22222,ACCEC9E3BDSPR,0767847539,Tallulah,"[9, 9]","At first this film seemed like it wasn't going to be that great - it was coming across to me as puerile and unoriginal.  However, ten minutes later I decided I was completely wrong - it's an excellent movie!  All right, it's never going to be great art, but it was still very enjoyable.  All three leads were brilliant, interacting really well together and making me laugh out loud lots of times, and the slightly offbeat humour was refreshingly different from a lot of chick flick movies.I read the novel this film is based on (Virtual Sexual Reality, by Chloe Rayban) and really enjoyed it, so I was worried that the film would completely ruin it.  I worried needlessly - the two are completely different, because while the book makes you think more, the film is more entertaining and has a better pace.Overall, my only gripe with this film is the ending.  I just felt really annoyed that we know Justine and Chas didn't stay together forever (oops, spoiler).  All right, that would be unrealistic, but I'm a romantic - I need to feel there's some hope for me!Overall, though, this film is really enjoyable - just right for a girls' night in, and some guys might enjoy it too.
