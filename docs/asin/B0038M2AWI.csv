While I don't follow the field super-closely, I've read a lot of related books and paid attention to quirky reports that might indicate alien influence. It's not that I'm committed to this kind of research or take it all seriously, but... well, it's interesting. It's odd. I like how it explains and connects otherwise anomalous events and archaeological finds.I especially like this series because the producers include a variety of opinions about what's reported. Even better, I enjoy their reconstructions of &#34;what if...?&#34; theories. They take the evidence at face value, and see what happens if they take the design, theory, or whatever in a literal and logical direction.I've been utterly astonished when many of those things move from folklore to fact. In the first episode, the things that could take flight... that's fascinating. I know how tricky aerodynamics can be, so I didn't expect the objects to have the necessary lift without significant redesigns.All in all, this season covered a lot of information with just the right balance between skeptical inquiry and outright speculation.

1331875,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B0038M2AWI,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[120, 181]","The way the subject of ancient aliens is approached by this program, it's sometimes fascinating, and almost a breakthrough, until you actually bother to look at actual facts, and approach things critically and logically.I love the idea of ancient astronauts.  It thrills me.  I'm in love with exploring the idea, though not to the degree taken in the program of ""aliens built everything and did everything"".But the program shoots itself in the face by relying on the following piss-poor methods of interpretation and presentation:- Jumping to conclusions with little to no foundation- Ignoring critical facts- Accepting debunked works/theories as fact- Assuming that ancient peoples were helplessly incompetent- Wild guessesI am admitting myself to be biased, but the fact is that the above methods completely destroys this program's ""evidence"" and presentation.  Voting my review down is not simply denying a blind skeptic the chance to bash the program; I have watched virtually all the episodes, even the ""proto"" episode 2 hour documentary from the year before that covered the subject as well.  I've seen incredible examples of potential alien involvement in Earth's history in the form of references in scripture of the Old Testament, the Enuma Elish, and noncanon biblical works, such as one which refers to Noah (the Ark builder) as the ""First of God's new generation""---Battlestar Galactica ahoy!Erich von Daniken even presents the best evidence, and does NOT leap to wild-[...] accusations like much of the others do.The nutbag I had noted in an earlier review is Giorgio A. Tsoukalos.  This guy has his hair wildly pushed up and out, an orange-toned tan, and spews some of the wildest, nonsensical, ridiculous statements of the program.  He's vivacious and smiles a lot and loves the subject, but he comes across as utterly crazed (not as in mentally ill or insane) to a degree practically of fanaticism.As for the program contents itself, going by the points one by one:- Jumping to conclusions with little to no foundationThe episode ""Gods and Aliens"" begins by telling us that the story of the Iliad was long believed to be fictional, until Henrich Schliemann went to Asia Minor, dug a big hole, and found Troy.  The people in the program then say, this means that the story of the Iliad was true; thus, it's possible that OTHER stories in Greek myth are true, and that Gods and monsters and such might have been ancient aliens.First of all, the discovery of Troy DOES NOT prove that the Iliad is true.  According to the Iliad, two armies fought outside the gates of the city for ten years, and the Gods DIRECTLY intervened on a regular basis.  According to the Iliad, the Greek army could not make any advances against the Trojans unless ONE man out of thousands, Achilleus, re-joined the army to lead his small group of soldiers.Schliemann discovered ruins of a big city near the site where Troy is said to have existed.  That is all.  They did not find evidence of men named Achilles, Agammemnon, Paris Alexandros, Hektor, Odysseus, or Apollo's arrows having punctured many men and poisoned them.  All they found was ruins; and not even a singular set of ruins, but MULTIPLE sets of ruins, indicating that the site of Troy had been destroyed many times, by earthquakes or neglect due to mass migrations, or war.- Ignoring critical factsIf you go by what the ancient alien theorists say, you'd assume the Mayan people suddenly disappeared one day.  And damn those fakers in Central America who call themselves Mayans today!  One of the most audacious theories they suppose is that the idea of ""rapture"" in Christian theology was something that involved alien intervention, and that the Mayans suddenly ""vanished"" from history, so this is somehow evidence that perhaps they were taken away by aliens.First off, using the fallacy of ""Evidence of absence"", I could theorize that the Mayans evolved into flying squid, and flew off into space, and you can't prove me wrong because there's not evidence that that DIDN'T happen.But more importantly, the MAYANS NEVER DISAPPEARED!  Their civilization collapsed, due to the usual factors of natural disaster, overpopulation, overhunting and overfarming, trade collapse, revolutions, and outside invasion.  They didn't just collapse and disappear either; Mayans continued to flourish to a small degree, and still exist even to this day.Another example involves Greek myth with demigods and the Gods interacting with humans, and sexually producing offspring.  Most of the examples given are rather solid, but the idea supposed is that the Spartans were somehow descended from these people, given that they were almost invincible in battle, and their women renowned for their beauty.First off, Spartans were not invincible in battle.  They lost many battles.  They were not superhuman; in fact, the very reason for their legendary greatness (the killing of babies with imperfections) was the primary reason for their downfall; not enough ""pure"" babies born, they run out of Spartiates, they cannot compete.  Considering that even Spartan girls were given some training in the Agoge, and allowed to participate in athletic competitions, Spartan women were in good physical shape, as opposed to the majority of women in Greece, who were not allowed to do much of anything apart from being housewives.Another frustrating point; the theories put forth that are so wild and ridiculous, I can't even guess as to what section to put them under: Aliens interacting with Nazis.Germany was an industrial powerhouse long before the war began.  In fact, Hitler did not magically create heavy industry when he took power; the infrastructure was already there.  He gave people the will to start working and developing heavy armor and weapons, and he collected an incredible cadre of scientists and intellectuals with funding and support for weapons research.According to ancient alien theorists, weapons projects such as the V2 rocket are somehow TOO advanced for 1930s humanity, and they are the result of alien technology given to Hitler.  Considering this is the same program that has aliens using laser weapons, nuclear weapons, aircraft that can lift off vertically and with very little sound, cause the world to flood (as in the Great Flood), clone, and genetically engineer people, it's a hell of a mystery as to why the aliens didn't give this sort of technology to the Nazis, instead of giving them some rockets and a gun.  Also keep in mind that the Nazis LOST the war, and they probably would have lost it even if the US and Britain hadn't massed and launched the invasion of France in 1944---they'd been fought to a standstill in Greece, and after losing an ENTIRE ARMY in Russia, the Soviets were steamrolling over them on their way west.  They were horribly overextended, losing supplies, losing men, losing everything horribly.At the very least, the program supposes another idea, that an alien craft crashed in Germany, and the Nazis found it, and attempted to reverse engineer its weapons and engines and the like to best fit them.  You might as well guess that Hitler was the reincarnation of Raptor Jesus, and Nazi soldiers were actually all genetically engineered supermen developed decades earlier by freemasons or Illuminati, because that's about how much evidence that idea has.- Wild GuessesPeople are inherently intelligent, creative, and thoughtful, particularly if they are educated and have time to themselves to think.  The idea presented by these ancient alien theorists would have you believe that ancient people were highly literal and completely incapable of imagination.  They make assumptions that Odin, according to myth, wielded a spear that never missed its target, and thus this must have been a laser weapon or some sort of projectile gun with terrible accuracy.  They assume that because Zeus throws lightning to the Earth, this must mean the Zeus alien had laser beams that struck Earth.A spear that never misses hardly takes much imagination, particularly if you heighten the military prowess of someone like Odin, never missing with their spear is testament to their skill with the weapon.  Assuming that a spear that never misses must have been an ancient interpretation of an alien projectile weapon is like drawing a complicated constellation design out of three stars aligned together (as in, not something like a belt, but something like a submarine or a lightsaber)Another such wild guess involves the interpretation that monsters and creatures of myth, such as Centaurs and Cylopses and Giants and the like are evidence that they may have been aliens that interacted with humans.  This is not only a wild-[...] guess, but it's an uphill battle against a far more concrete theory that involves archaeology:The skulls of Mammoths, Mastodons, and Elephants look vaguely humanoid, and have huge holes in the center of them.  Fossils of such skulls were found by ancient Greek and Roman people---we have written evidence of Romans and Greeks finding such bones in areas where modern archaeologists have found animal fossils.  It takes a whole lot more imagination to assume Cyclops and Giants were ancient aliens than it does to assume that a person finding a Mammoth skull would think it the skull of a one-eyed giant, or finding huge vertebrae or leg bones to be those of giant humanoids.- Accepting debunked works/theories as factI saw it coming, I begged and pleaded not to, I genuinely hoped that they didn't, but inevitably, they did;  Zecharia Sitchin.For those who don't know, Zecharia Sitchin was a man (who passed away in October 2010) who claimed to have translated ancient Sumerian glyphs, and uncovered evidence that the Annunaki of Sumerian myth were actually alien beings, and developed this hugely, wildly elaborate story of the Annunaki coming to Earth and creating us, Homo Sapien, through genetic engineering with native humanoid creautres on Earth, using us as slaves to mine gold, which they needed for their planet's atmosphere or something because their planet was dying.  He also developed the theory of Nibiru, a wandering planet, which has taken on a life of its own among conspiracy theorists who claimed Nibiru would collide with Earth in May 2003, and now in 2012, because that's the hot pop date to assume armageddon (Hint: The Mayans NEVER implied that the world would end in 2012)Zecharia Sitchin's theories on this ancient alien theory hold less water than even conspiracy theories on the JFK assassination or the Apollo 11 moon landing.  His theory is completely at odds with physics and astronomy, his translations are horribly flawed, or in some cases totally wrong, and he takes Sumerian myth literally, while ignoring the mythology of other civilizations around the world.Another point; the Crystal Skulls.  A great deal of information is poured into the theory of crystal skulls being some sort of computer or machine made by ancient aliens.  The worst part is, they even tell the true story about the skulls---that they were carved in the late 19th century Germany---but continue with their ridiculous theory.- Assuming that ancient peoples were helplessly incompetentThis is a popular one, assuming that early humans were incapable of building big buildings, or harvesting crops on their own, or looking at the stars and recognizing that stuff happened in the sky, and that the moon could have eclipses that could be predicted quite easily, or were incapable of carving figures out of stone, and moving these stone figures across land.I'm not well informed enough on this point to argue, but I've included several links in the comments section to address this.I don't really know what to say regarding this.  It's marvelous and astonishing that they come up with these ideas, but it's ridiculous, frustrating, and even offensive the way they use fallacious arguments and non-evidence to support their increasingly more buffoonish and garish theories and ideas.",1,Shooting themselves in the face,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,11986,"['way', 'subject', 'ancient', 'aliens', 'approached', 'program',

1331882,A2VMT89TCSF105,B0038M2AWI,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[3, 6]","""Ancient Aliens"" is a series devoted to promote the ridiculous (and ridiculously popular) speculations of Erich von D&auml;niken. Geezus. I assumed D&auml;niken was dead!The first few minutes of Episode One did give me some entertaining moments of ""d&eacute;j&agrave; vu"", since I also believed in D&auml;niken and similar writers...at the age of 12, or thereabouts. Then I read a book debunking D&auml;niken & Friends, and realized that *real* archaeology is even more fascinating than the rather dull explanation that ""aliens"" from Sirius were behind it all.The rest of the almost 90 minute ""documentary"" was less entertaining. I mean, these guys haven't changed a lot in 40 years, have they? The Nazca lines, the Mayan ""astronaut"" at Palenque, the Hindu vimanas, the Piri Reis map, ""who built the Egyptian pyramids"", Ezekiel's wheels within wheels...I won't attempt a detailed debunking here (you can probably find it in cheap paperbacks published 40 years ago), but I have to complain about the Euro-centric chronological snobbery which assumes that ancient peoples were primitive blockheads and simply cannot have built large stone structures or ""discovered electricity"" all by themselves. Why not draw the opposite conclusion instead: the Black African Pharaohs of the Old Kingdom really were pretty smart guys. So were, I suppose, their architects.Another thing that makes my head hurt when watching this are the philistine over-simplifications. The Nazca lines or the Mayan ruler at Palenque fit a certain cultural context, carefully described by competent scholars. So yes, we *do* know that the Mayan ruler is ""descending into the underworld"", rather than manning a space rocket. Yet, D&auml;niken and his followers still babble on about the ""remarkable similarities"" between ancient pieces of art and modern astronauts with helmets?!Further, ""Ancient Aliens"" lack a proper spiritual understanding. The idea that religious scriptures are really about flesh-and-blood alien astronauts (or is it silicon and green goo?) is another piece of warped chronological snobbery, as if the ancients didn't have a proper spiritual life featuring shamans, prophets and other visionaries of supernatural realities, not ""aliens"" in Flash Gordon outfits. (The only exception would be Michael Cremo, who is a devotee of the Hare Krishna movement. Presumably, he therefore believes that the ""aliens"" really were gods! So what's he doing on this show?)But the worst thing is surely the illogic of it all. If the aliens came here in hovering UFO-type craft, why did the Nazca people build long ""airstrips"" to make them come back? If the aliens landed in Egypt, why did they teach the Pharaohs stone masonry, rather than setting up a futuristic city in the Nile delta? Why did some alien craft look like the Apollo moon rocket, surely a piece of space junk from the perspective of a civilization that can use anti-gravity to hover in a luminous craft &aacute; la wheels-within-wheels?

I think that it just shows a different interpretation of the worlds religions and mythologies. If one doesn't choose to believe in them. If one chooses to believe the ancient astronaut theory then they will find it more interesting than a skeptic.I am a skeptic when it comes to this. Some of the so called 'evidence' is a little bit comical. Suggesting that just because a cave painting or a little statue has what could be interpreted as wearing a 'helmet' or 'suit' is a little bit laughable to me. To me it's an ancient artist's interpretation. Not concrete evidence. The tool marks that 'can't' be made by ancient tools. Well, we weren't there, we don't use those tools. So I can't say those tool marks weren't made by the tool. The showing of so called 'giant' skulls and comparing them with dental impressions and claiming the impressions are so much smaller.

I is intriguing and it is a subject which has fascinated me for years. My problem is that these guys not only treat speculation as fact, but also show that they often have no idea what they are talking about, especially when it comes to ancient literature. For instance, I have taught almost every one of the epics they have discussed in their programs and there are things that they state about the poems that are downright fabrication. I have thought on numerous occasions ""what version of ""Gilgamesh,"" ""The Ramayana,"" ""The Iliad,"" ""The Odyssey,"" ""The Mahabarata,"" or ""Beowulf"" did they read? They mention things about the stories which simply are not in them! I've taught ""Gilgamesh"" for thirty years and there is no part of that poem where he goes flying around the earth. No, it IS NOT THERE! That is just ONE example of many. Also, they attribute things to ""The Rg Veda"" which are FALSE. It's too bad because wackos like the screwy dude with the funky hair and the Greek name give the whole idea of ancient alien visitation a bad name. He has a degree alright...in SPORTS INFORMATION! That qualifies him to interpret ancient texts? Then there is the whole thing they go into about Ahkenaton's family having weird and elongated heads. What they don't say is that mishapen heads like that have been done as a ""beautifying"" affect in many cultures since ancient times. This was the case in Egypt during the Amarna era...many of the nobility did the same with their children to emulate pharaoh and his family. This does not mean they were ALIENS! Look, I want the ""Theory"" to be true as much as the next person, but stand on true fact...or speculate and hypothesize, but do so in a responsible and scholarly way.

1331912,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0038M2AWI,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","ANCIENT ALIENS, season one (History Channel (""H2"") TV series, 2009 to date, 5 seasons so far) is one angering hoot of a program. How can one say such a contradictory thing? Well, it's fun to laugh at when I have no other pressing business. This is a subject TV never tires of using to steamroller the audience. Some of this hypothesizing goes back to the 1970s. ""Ancient Aliens"" itself as a concept for a series goes back to the mid-1990s and they did one in 2004 or 2005.I also noticed a separate sort of documentary dating to 2010, which is simple-minded rehash of this simple-minded fare, and I wonder why they did it with this series already in full swing.I do not need to explain too strenuously that the series is about a bunch of fools - people who truly think our earth was visited by extraterrestrials, who seeded life here, gave us all our good ideas and even commanded us to a specific set of religions. Some of these people go so far as to say Einstein and Tesla were probably aliens. They truly believe this zealous nonsense. Naturally, the goal of the series has become simple: tie aliens to EVERYTHING, from Bigfoot to the Founding Fathers.You know, it's one thing to say, ""Alien extraterrestrial astronauts could be a hypothesis we can consider,"" but it is quite another thing to say, ""Extraterrestrials did it all!! There's no other possible answer!!"" - and this show does the latter every single time. It is repetitive, uninformative, and downright stupid.So you have on this series repeat offenders such as the tirelessly goofy David Childress and the annoyingly presumptuous Giorgio Tsoukalos (who sounds to me like he's faking a vaguely Euro-stylish accent, but only because I have heard him speak perfectly normal ""rural New York""-sounding English).This early in the series, season one, is even a tiny bit interesting to me because it was a novel idea that I thought was very good - at the time. I thought Von D&auml;niken would be helming this series. I thought it would deeply and intelligently explore this theory of ancient extraterrestrial astronauts, with which I disagree so strongly yet it interests me. Well, no such luck for any of my hopes.This thing is an idiotfest from day one, and has been called by a leading Smithsonian Institution scientist ""garbage from the depths of the chum bucket"" that is television today.Von D&auml;niken, in my estimation, really stepped down into the muck to appear in these episodes, though he has reason since Giorgio Tsoukalos is his second-hand man. On occasion there are real experts, but I question what they're doing on this dumb program. Somehow it strikes me that they are tricked into it.Several experts, such as Dr. Robert Schoch, a perennial favorite of mine and true genius, probably appear because they have an interest and because they too are controversial. The late Phil Coppens, a Belgian journalist, was also a good egg and an interesting man - and it is a perfect example of the shame of one-dimensional thinking that he was so into this subject.This series is simply silly. I'm as game as anybody for a nice whack-a-doodle ""theory"" once in a while, but a show that has the narrator saying ""as ancient astronaut theorists believe"" literally every other sentence is nothing more than bad propaganda. At least in season one they had not yet developed that ugly vocal tic, and in the 2013 season they have reworded it slightly, and cut down on its use.Naturally the show is wonderful for seeing the many places they visit - and I do often watch reruns with the sound off for that purpose. I can't stand hearing nothing but ""aliens built this"" over and over and over. The sites they visit are terribly controversial as to age. No one knows, for example, if Puma Punku is really 13,000 years old, 31,000 years old or 1,300 years old because you cannot date rock. (If you're one the clowns on this show you couldn't date anything.)Experts often argue about whether the Central/South American sites are much older than pre-Colombian, while others say they are much older, so we just do not know. These guys on ANCIENT ALIENS always say the sites predate Adam, as if he were actually real, they had known him personally and he assured them of it.Well, I look in the mirror a lot, I like to think I'm way younger, yet I look and feel I may be far older - like Govekli Tepe in Turkey or Teotihuacan.

After all, the 'Ancient Alien' theory is as profound, if not more so, than possibly any other theories on anything, and they're asking us to swallow this whole without rebuttal. It doesn't work that way. They need to go toe to toe with their detractors. They also do say some pretty stupid things that don't bolster their case. The producers and writers let some things go in the script that would not hold up in the scientific arena.That aside, this is still pretty cool. They show some great footage of the various places and things they deal with. They have some good talking heads to add flavor and it all progresses in a very logical and orderly fashion. They make a decent case. Something peculiar does happen at episode seven however. The segments go from one hour fifteen minutes to forty five minutes. The narrator changes and they start to repeat things from earlier episodes. I wasn't checking producer and writer credits so I'm not certain what happened here but it was a bit annoying.In my mind this makes all the sense in the world.

Sound ridiculous? Kinda is. There are five episodes on 3 Blu-ray discs with a running time of nearing 8 hours so they are uber-long episodes: The Evidence, The Visitors, The Mission, Closer Encounters, The Return.Granted, there are many not fully explained feats from ancient times, one of the most obvious being all the architecture in ancient Egypt with the giant pyramids. Basically with all the giant stones shaped so perfectly and weighing so much without the use of the wheel, it seems impossible to craft. Some ancient stories are passed down that sound similar to a spaceship or rocket landing and/or taking off so putting two and two together equals...aliens gave them the technology and tools and then took it back with them?? They cited fact after fact that made it physically impossible for the Egyptians to craft this wonder of the world with the pyramids, but the historians seem to be operating on the assumption that once you rule out all possible options, the impossible must be it! They brought some giant construction vehicles and then loaded them back on their flying saucers and beamed away into space.Historians not only cite events that have obvious evidence left behind like the pyramids themselves, but also stories like from the Bible. They try to figure out if a story from the Bible could have been explained better using Aliens. Instead of God coming down with a chariot, it was Aliens and they asked so-and-so to measure a building for them.I thought this was going to be kind of cool and the historians would have more realistic reasons evidence of aliens being involved but all they are really doing is giving a blanket explanation for lots of wondrous occurrences, documented and not, throughout ancient civilization history. I do not really recommend this one. It's not even as much fun as a conspiracy theory like the X-files. I much more enjoyed ""I Know What I Saw"" about military officials telling the stories of their unidentified flying object sightings, click on the link above to check out my review for that.Bonus FeaturesThere is a bonus History channel special called ""Ancient Aliens: Chariots, Gods and Beyond.""

The show piles guesswork on top of supposition building up the most wobbly of arguments for why aliens are responsible for everything from the pyramids to the theory of relativity. Opposing viewpoints are never mentioned, nor are facts allowed to get in the way.Every time the announcer says ""Ancient astronaut theorists"" you can substitute the phrase ""Tin foil hat wearers"" and as soon as Giorgio Tsoukalos (aka: the Greek guy with the wild hair) shows up, it is the signal to change the channel.I do believe there could be something to the UFO phenomena.

There are a lot of questions that have no definitive answer with our past, many of which K. Salinger's review point out.  There are coincidences that occur which don't seem natural at all, but at the same time seem near impossible given that cultures in the past supposedly had no contact with one another.Season 1  contains 5  double length episodes(about 1hr 20min each) attempting to answers these questions by providing you facts and various expert opinions both FOR and AGAINST  the idea of Ancient Alien Astronauts.  The BONUS episode is a great  double length episode which focuses on the controversial book, Chariots of the Gods.What makes this show so wonderful is the fact it tries very hard to present pure fact.  The information gathered and presented can not be disputed by archeologists because they were the ones who actually discovered it; it all is in how you put the pieces together.  The show essentially ""thinks outside of the box"" , showing you connections that boggle the mind yet you can't dispute it because it is right there in front of you.If you are into history, ufo conspiracy, archeology etc  this is a great show to watch.

Why does it make sense?...because if you follow evolution then we would not be as intelligent as we are today. Why? What other animal builds sky scrapers? The Earth has been evolving and growing life for up to 4 billion years and humans are the ones to break the sentient marker only 14,000 years ago? buuuuuull crap. Utter bullcrap. Scientists and archeologists agree that our concept of civilization says that literally over night man became sentient and went from eating berries to building structures. How do we know what happened? Let's ask people who were actually there, that let their eyewitness accounts of what happened.Obviously not every god can be correct. If Zeus is real then why do people have reports of Allah? If Jesus was real then what is the deal with Wandjina? If you read the ancient texts these were actual people. These beings walked among humans and most times mated with them. They were flesh and blood. Many religions state that their gods died (most notably the Egyptian religions), and a lot of gods even had birth days in which they were born, most notably gods from the Maya which have their birthdays coincide with time periods of the Maya calender.These were flesh and blood beings. How did they get here? On the flying vehicles their religions tell us about. In the Bible, in the Maya code, in Egyptian hieroglyphs...everywhere in ancient texts we are finding stories or flying vehicles. The most famous would be the vimana from the Mahabharata.We have eyewitness accounts, we have descriptions of space in many old religions and the description of flying vehicles in space. We have everything that we would need other than scientist's OK. To heck with scientists. There are written accounts, visual accounts, mathematics, logic, analogies of modern cargo cults, that all go into the soup to create the truth.Answer me this question. If ancient aliens did create us from long time ago, wouldn't it be logic that we see, and do see, UFO's flying around today? How else would they know we were here if they hadn't created us?Were we created by extraterrestrials? Yes. This is a great show with a great message.

Larson""","[1, 3]","This review is for the whole Ancient Aliens series.I cannot agree with the present belief system that the universe and our planet just happened to be lucky enough to bare life and ""here we are"". The conventional hypothesis, that earliest living cells emerged as a result of chemical evolution on our planet billions of years ago in a process called abiogenesis. The alternative possibility--that living cells or their precursors arrived from space--strikes many people as science fiction (as most seem to view this series) yet to me that seems more realistic.That life could exist before mankind and that this life may have explored the stars and happen to find the earth also hits mankinds ego and therefore cannot be true to the minds of most people. To not keep an open mind until all the theories can be proven fake and what remains is proven truth; that is prejudice, plane and simple.All that being said, this series needs a better structure, and not so much jumping around. I would prefer a more scholarly approach to each subject, yet maintaining an easy to understand format so the idea can take root in the minds of those who think they know it all or are otherwise satisfied with the common beliefs.I cannot agree with all the findings or assumptions they attempt to make you believe (hence four stars not five). Every one is entitled to their own theories, but in a series or book, facts should be presented while letting the viewer/readership decide for themselves.One such idea presented is aliens from another world came to earth long, long ago. Okay, I can go along with that. But such a trip would have taken a major undertaking and would not have happened over and over again. So they came, perhaps more than once. I can agree to that. They set themselves up as gods. I can agree to that (look at mankinds own history to lesser developed peoples/cultures). But that they continued to visit us? That most of the UFO's in the last one hundred years are them? I cannot agree to that.I have read to much from ancient history to just sit back and not believe that life only sprang forth from earth. That only on earth are wars and fights among the intelligent and wise. And really, no matter how huge and powerful the whips were on the backs of slaves, could you really believe ancient mankind could build many (not all of them) of the wonders that remain today?If your are not a thinking person, open minded and willing to sit back and listen. Then afterward, pickup and pursue the subject that gets your interest most. Then this is not the series for you.

Probably. The reality is that biblical and other writers from other religions wrote down what they saw but given their limited knowledge they could only interpret based on what they knew not on what really was.  Does this mean that early writers really saw angels or was it an interpretation of what they saw based on their current knowledge at the time?

While I accept the possibility that some life form (alien to ours) could exists somewhere in the vast reaches of the universe, there is nothing in any of the episodes of this program which indicates any form of positive proof.  Apart from some of the more recent ""whack jobs"" (I was abducted by aliens and they performed experiments on me) everything in this series relates to ""ancient"" times.  Why? Because that allows conjecture, theory, opinion without the need for physical evidence.Take for example the theory regarding the elongated heads of the early Egyptian Pharos. If examples of the ancient arts are to be believed (and some commentators played on this fact) then the elongation of the skulls of these particular people would be seen as ""massive"". And yet, when the remains of the Pharo were finally discovered, we are shown a skull with nothing more than a slight enlargement or elongation.It should be noted that the majority of contributors to this series have no scientific qualifications and those who do simply use the tried and tested old cover up by stating, ""in my opinion"". By simply stating an opinion, they are not required to provide any physical evidence and by voicing an opinion they have not said anything which may bring their scientific qualifications into question. And if they are not voicing an opinion, they are asking a question, but giving no answers.It is also unfortunate that having seen one episode of the series, you have seen them all. In each new episode we are taken back to the same old information we got in the first episode, sometimes with a slightly differing view of what it all means, but in reality, it's the same tired old information, over and over again.So for all those who had input into this series, for all those who did nothing more than voice an opinion or ask a question, I have only one thing to say: ""show me the proof"".

Split over several episodes, each episode examines one possible aspect of alien presence on Earth; from ancient architectural marvels to scriptural mentions of supernatural figures such as angels and demons.

Identified simply as &#34;author&#34; or &#34;UFO Investigator&#34; or the ubiquitous title &#34;publisher,&#34; they offer theories and &#34;facts&#34; in a variety of scientific and academic fields as though they have any training or familiarity whatsoever with the disciplines at hand.  Unburdened by the need for expertise, the preposterous quickly becomes the normal, facts not in evidence become dogma, and the unprovable becomes the incontestible.  Hilarity ensues as they &#34;riff&#34; off of one another, citing the ridiculous theory of one commentator to support the risible ideas of another.It does get tiresome, as the episodes are rather long and some of the commentators' verbal tics can grate.

It must be very profitable because the series 'Ancient Aliens' is now in its fourth season. Filled with false inferences made from actual research and discoveries, distortions of that same research, and outright lies, the first season of 'Ancient Aliens' is so bad that it will make knowledgable persons want to vomit.  Perhaps that is exactly what the more principled producers of this show do before they make their weekly trip to the bank to deposit the salary they earn from this awful series.'Ancient Aliens' proves one sure thing. It is this: skillful editing can make anything seem logical and believable. We are all gullible when it comes to viewing skillfully edited and entertaining speculation. We all desire to learn the 'mysteries' of the universe. So we watch garbage like this show that provides easy answers to complex history from the mouths of the on-screen speakers while we fail to notice that they also have their hands in our pockets searching for our wallets.  Like the best  of the political ads we see on TV, the on-screen 'experts' appear very sincere and convincing. The 'experts' seem so sure of themselves that you would never believe that they are either deluded, uneducated, or simply con artists out to make a buck.The average viewer is not expert enough on the history of the ancient world and cultures. It is not a subject that schools spend much time on and many people get most of their knowledge of pre-history from highly inaccurate films that repeat falsities and encourage myths that perpetuate throughout time. Hey, when I was a kid I thought that all cowboys really were like Hopalong Cassidy.I am not critical of those who watch this fictionalized history. We are all gullible enough to believe one thing or another. We all like to speculate about the mysteries of life, and if we grew up on science fiction, we all fantasied about aliens on other worlds. However we are being taken advantage of, especially those of us who lack knowledge of the ancient world, by the fakers who made this series. They not only want our money, but also distort our understanding of the real history that is far more interesting than the fantasies that are presented to us in this series.Before you pluck down some hard earning cash for this historical video con game, do yourself a favor and do a google search for the FREE 3 hour film 'Ancient Aliens Debunked'.

As a caveat, some of it is ""far out""; a lot of conjecture is made during disk 2 for certain; and some of the narrators are intense in their beliefs, which should come as no surprise when viewing something like this. But there are also a lot of definite areas based on actual facts, places, archeological sites that provide food for departure of thought in different directions.  Since no one seems to know for sure, it is always good to question, reason, try to find out why.  This accounting, set up as a documentary, is at least delving into the mysterious topic rather than ""covering up"" to avoid exploring all the avenues that can't help but be out there.Take Peru, for example.  Personally, I have always been intrigued by the mystery of the Nazca lines, which are filmed from the skies for this accounting.  They seemed to be far too intricate, far too exact in relative, geometric measurements for something so large to be done by hand with primitive tools, no matter how many people may have been involved; and seemingly made to be observed from the air.  Signals to cosmic visitors by their own kind after having been here, or an early quest to ""invite"" cosmic visitors by the ancients? Or beckoning from below to what ancients revered as Gods just in case they were up there? Whether they were out there or not, it was an amazing feat of engineering design no matter which way your own thought process takes you.Whether you believe in aliens or not, or have your own specific ideas of what is what regarding the space around us, this disk set brings a lot of unanswered questions to the fore to be mulled over in your own way.  The sites visited are sites we all are familiar with, and some I had never seen.

First the most compelling bit of evidence was the plane they built from the little token found in Mesoamerica.Here's where they lose me: Aliens helping Nazis.  The most light-hearted rebuttal first.  Germany lost so the aliens really gave them some crappy help.  I can just hear Albert Speer remarking of the aliens, ""With friends like them we don't need enemies.""  The serious rebuttal.

This game was so huge it had to set up in a pole barn.  I am currently playing Hearts of Iron.  The reason I bring these games up is that WWII and especially the German side is extremely popular in wargames.  Since Germany in WWII is so popular there is not an aspect of German production that has not been examined, researched, studied, and examined again, researched again and studied again.  There are people who know serial numbers on individual tank motors.  There are people who know how many spot welds were used in the manufacture of a FW 190.  There are people who know how many tons of metal Germany imported form Sweden each day.  There are people who know how may liters of syntheticfuel Germany produced each hour.There is not an iota of German production that is not known.  This is not speculation this is a fact.

If you can get past the occasional speaker talking about their highly speculative thoughts on what the discoveries/texts mean then you will get at the true value of the series.  What I really enjoy about the series is it looks at recent and past discoveries that prove that intelligent life forms existed on Earth thousands of years before we had previously thought.

Similar connections in ""evidence"" separated by several centuries, presented to the audience with logical hypothesis is quite fascinating.This series will sometimes be ""reaching"" for explainations, but it truly does provide a fresh perspective. Many religious followers will insert ""God's Will"" for unexplained events rather than accept the possibility that what they know to be God is actually an extraterrestrial being from a far advanced civilization.There will always be sceptics, and as history proves, science will often take a back seat to political & religious ideals.
