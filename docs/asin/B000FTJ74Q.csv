995941,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FTJ74Q,A Customer,"[8, 11]","Adam and Steve is so uneven and thematically all over the place, and at times it ranges from down-right funny to sometimes cringe inducing, but the film, as a whole, is imbued with an honesty and it really works, mainly because of the charisma and chemistry of the two male leads, but also because it's a film about two gay guys who fall in love that is actually acted by two out gay actors, rather than straight actors playing gay (think Heath and Jake in Brokeback Mountain).The talented Craig Chester - who has been acting in queer-themed films for years and who wrote and directed this film - plays Adam, a former goth who falls heavenly in love with dancer-turned-doctor Steve (Malcolm Gets). But their attempt to start a meaningful relationship is mired by the fact that they met in 1987 under less desirable circumstances.Adam and Steve actually met at a New York nightclub seventeen years ago when Adam and his plump friend Rhonda (Parker Posey) stumble into the club thinking it's Goth night, but are horrified to find a glittery dance troupe on stage. But once Adam and lead go-go boy Steve (Gets) lock eyes, it's lust at first sight. Steve gives Adam his first bump of coke, and several lines later they're back at Adam's place, tearing at each other's clothes and proclaiming their undying love.Unfortunately, the coke is laced with baby laxatives and without warning the laxatives kick in. The evening comes to an abrupt and very messy end much to the mortification of the poor Adam who is left to clean up all the mess. Seventeen years later, Adam and Steve meet again, after Adam accidentally stabs his dog and rushes him to the hospital where Steve now works as a psychiatrist.Neither remember each other, but Steve still carries the memory of that humiliating moment of incontinence deep within his psyche; while Adam, meanwhile, has matured into a neurotic gay man who has had to fight various addictions over the years. Will Adam and Steve remember that fateful night and will they be able to conquer their respective paranoia's and find true love?Adam and Steve is cute and refreshing, especially when it doesn't take itself too seriously. Chester and Gets have a lovely chemistry together and it is helped along by the fact that their courtship appears natural and real.  Their antics also distract nicely from the fact that the couple never actually say anything interesting to each another - there's a lot of endearing babbling, but then again, complexity and insightfulness has never been a prerequisite for heterosexual romances either.Adam & Steve is indeed a jagged and bumpy ride, but what makes the film so special is that it's a relief to see a gay romance that isn't about abdominal-perfect 20-year-olds, and which features lovers played by two long out-of-the-closet actors. At least you can invest some sort of realism into all the kissing and the lovemaking.The opening fifteen minutes of the film are the best, as Posey and Chester strut their stuff in the night club - him in full goth makeup and her in a fat suit, but as the film goes on and as the characters mature, the film begins to lose a sense of itself, mixing in elements of absurd surrealism and there's some sardonic observations about modern gay manners that don't quite work.There's also a bizarre country and western dance number, featuring Jackie Beat that seems a bit out of place with the rest of the story. As a result some of the film works and some of it doesn't and the best parts are always the simplest, in which the stars - Chester, Gets, Posey and Chris Kattan playing Steve's jealous but straight roommate - let their personalities and their natural inclination for irreverence and cheekiness shine though.

995942,A9T1R7JIWX3EU,B000FTJ74Q,A. M. Smith,"[3, 4]","""Adam and Steve"" is the cinematic equivalent of a beach read. Entertaining throughout, a little off-color in spots  but not terribly risqu&eacute;. Amusing. Craig Chester really seems to be trying just a bit too hard here as director and star, and the humor is often strained, often sophomoric, and some of the gags just get overworked, but it's a bedroom farce so that's almost to be expected. The actors, to a person, are all engaging although, sadly, there's really little screen chemsitry between the principals, which is a shame because, taken individually, their performances, as I mentioned, are all engaging. It's good, however, to see gay actors playing gay roles for a change. It's not ""great art,"" and breaks no new ground, but it's a nice, easy fluff piece.

995943,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000FTJ74Q,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 6]","Directing, writing and playing one of the title characters, Craig Chester attempts to pull a Streisand triple play with this low-budget 2005 film, but his strenuous multi-tasking results in an unwieldy combination of character-driven romantic comedy and flat-out farce that doesn't quite satisfy the requirements of either genre. For the most part, Chester seems to be making a gay version of ""When Harry Met Sally"" starting with a flashback to 1987 when Adam, a self-loathing goth accompanied by his overweight and equally morose friend Rhonda, meets Steve, a glam-rock dancer on disco night at a trendy Manhattan club. A night of cocaine laced with baby laxative leads to an unfortunate episode which has to be seen to be believed. Sparks fly when they accidentally meet each other again many years later not knowing who the other is.It's refreshing to see a gay movie that frees itself from more serious concerns like rights violations and persecution, but the film is ultimately done in by Chester's reliance on standard rom-com clich&eacute;s and a wildly fluctuating tone, including an over-the-top finale that hinges on a country-style dance-off. Chester and Malcolm Gets are engaging if a bit bland in the lead roles. Perhaps because he has played so many sexually ambiguous characters on ""Saturday Night Live"", Chris Kattan is oddly stilted as Steve's straight roommate, while Parker Posey easily steals the picture as Rhonda, now skinny and a stand-up comic, with her natural sassiness and deft comedy timing. Several familiar faces show up in extended cameos - Paul Sand and Julie Hagerty as Adam's jinxed parents, Melinda Dillon as Steve's corn-belt mother and Sally Kirkland as an enthusiastic drug counselor. There are a surprising number of extras on the 2006 DVD - a solid commentary track from Chester and Gets, a making-of featurette, some deleted scenes, a gag reel and even a dance lesson to replicate the strutting moves in the finale.

995947,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000FTJ74Q,Grady Harp,"[31, 37]","ADAM AND STEVE is a movie you want to succeed: the idea of an honest gay relationship developing between two guys with a weird history and subsequent difficulties forming meaningful intimacy, the presence of four fine actors, and a film that seems to take itself not too seriously.  The problem is that writer/director/star Craig Chester just seems to have put too much into his bag for one film and in doing so he diluted the strength it could have had.Adam (Craig Chester) first met Steve (Malcolm Gets) in a dance bar in 1987 where Adam (accompanied by his grossly obese friend Rhonda - Parker Posey in a fat suit) is dazzled by Steve's good looks and on a bet from Rhonda ends up on the date from hell: after snorting coke cut with baby laxative the two men become amorous with some rather embarrassing consequences.  17 years later Adam is a bird watcher guide while his friend Rhonda, now without a single pound of fat, is a sadly unsuccessful standup comic. Adam inadvertently injures his beloved dog and in trying to get help at a human hospital encounters psychiatrist Steve and the two begin a courtship.Neither man is able to cope with the idea of monogamous intimacy yet they develop a solid relationship, despite visits with dysfunctional families (Adam's Jewish family are ridiculously accident prone while Steve's Texas redneck parents are coldly homophobic).  Steve has a straight roommate Michael (Chris Kattan) who plays into Steve's life the way Rhonda plays into Adam's life.  Eventually memory recovers the past, it is dealt with and the ending is very predictable - as well as bit sappy.Each of the main characters does a fine job with their respective roles.  It is the sidebar diversions that mess up the storyline rather than enhancing it.  Yes, much of the nonsense can be forgiven because the film's heart is in the right place, but why this talented group could not have inserted a little restraint here and there is a frustrating question with which we are left. It is an entertaining film that errs on over the top asides to the point of distraction.

But the film is going a long way beyond the simple words in these four lines and two verses. It is not enough to just touch the other and be touched by the other. We must understand that touching is a very complex activity. You have to touch the mind of the other and vice versa be touched by the mind of the other and in the same way your mind is supposed to touched the other and the other is supposed to touch your mind. But speaking of the mind, everything must be included and sorted out not in any way to judge or try what is good or bad but just to know who the other is and vice versa and to accept the other the way he is and to be accepted by the other the way you are. And that's what is meant by reaching.Straight sex erases this dual relation since one is a man and one is a woman and everything is reduced to that difference, but when the two persons are two men, or two women, the differences are so much deeper and more secret, less visible and more complicated. They cannot be reduced to a simple difference in sex since the two people are of the same sex. The differences are mental, intellectual, artistic, physical and of course the past of the people is different, their heritage is different and so many other things are different, but not the sex and nothing can be reduced to that circumstantial difference. It is so easy to forget all these things in a straight couple, to reduce the whole thing to a simple difference in sex. Actually the sex difference, or similitude, itself is the least important element in a love relation that can be even just as strong and yet not lead to sex. Love does not have to be realized in sex though sex should be a continuation of love, which it is not all the time.This film is touching at that level, emotionally strong and it really takes a whole village to bring two people together against all the odds that accumulate against them, especially when the two people are of the same sex. And when you live in East Village, New York, it takes the whole neighbourhood to do it and doing it changes the whole neighbourhood.That gives a tremendous density to this two human roads crossing and the two travellers coming together and little by little settling together. The story is complex and at the end we sure know there is no Bernstein curse of any sort, just a pile of unluckily coincidences that can be ended when you deeply believe that there is no curse on you.To conclude let me say that bringing together a Jewish birdwatcher from New York and a Christian psychiatrist from Texas is not that obvious, and we have to keep in mind that ""the end is in the beginning and yet you go on"" as Samuel Beckett said and he knew all the details of the curse of being different in a world that accepts only absolute uniformity and homogeneity.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Love takes a whole village to survive and bloom,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,2942,"['Love', 'TouchTouch', 'loveLove', 'reachingReaching', 'loveNo', 'one', 'could', 'sum', 'up', 'film', 'better', 'nearly', 'final', 'music', 'film', 'going', 'long', 'way', 'simple', 'words', 'four', 'lines', 'two', 'verses', 'not', 'enough', 'just', 'touch', 'other', 'be', 'touched', 'other', 'must', 'understand', 'touching', 'very', 'complex', 'activity', 'have', 'touch', 'mind', 'other', 'vice', 'versa', 'be', 'touched', 'mind', 'other', 'same', 'way', 'mind', 'supposed', 'touched', 'other', 'other', 'supposed', 'touch', 'mind', 'speaking', 'mind', 'everything', 'must', 'be', 'included', 'sorted', 'out', 'not', 'way', 'judge', 'try', 'what', 'good', 'bad', 'just', 'know', 'who', 'other', 'vice', 'versa', 'accept', 'other', 'way', 'be', 'accepted', 'other', 'way', 'are', 'what', 'meant', 'reaching.Straight', 'sex', 'dual', 'relation', 'one', 'man', 'one', 'woman', 'everything', 'reduced', 'difference', 'when', 'two', 'persons', 'are', 'two', 'men', 'two', 'women', 'differences', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'deeper', 'more', 'secret', 'less', 'visible', 'more', 'complicated', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'reduced', 'simple', 'difference', 'sex', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'same', 'sex', 'differences', 'are', 'mental', 'intellectual', 'artistic', 'physical', 'course', 'past', 'people', 'different', 'heritage', 'different', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'different', 'not', 'sex', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'reduced', 'circumstantial', 'difference', 'so', 'easy', 'forget', 'things', 'straight', 'couple', 'reduce', 'whole', 'thing', 'simple', 'difference', 'sex', 'Actually', 'sex', 'difference', 'similitude', 'least', 'important', 'element', 'love', 'relation', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'just', 'strong', 'yet', 'not', 'lead', 'sex', 'Love', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'realized', 'sex', 'sex', 'should', 'be', 'continuation', 'love', 'not', 'time.This', 'film', 'touching', 'level', 'emotionally', 'strong', 'really', 'whole', 'village', 'bring', 'two', 'people', 'together', 'odds', 'accumulate', 'especially', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'same', 'sex', 'when', 'live', 'East', 'Village', 'New', 'York', 'whole', 'neighbourhood', 'do', 'doing', 'whole', 'tremendous', 'density', 'two', 'human', 'roads', 'crossing', 'two', 'travellers', 'coming', 'together', 'little', 'little', 'settling', 'together', 'story', 'complex', 'end', 'sure', 'know', 'Bernstein', 'curse', 'sort', 'just', 'pile', 'unluckily', 'coincidences', 'can', 'be', 'ended', 'when', 'deeply', 'believe', 'curse', 'you.To', 'conclude', 'let', 'say', 'bringing', 'together', 'Jewish', 'birdwatcher', 'New', 'York', 'Christian', 'psychiatrist', 'Texas', 'not', 'obvious', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'end', 'beginning', 'yet', 'go', 'Samuel', 'Beckett', 'said', 'knew', 'details', 'curse', 'being', 'different', 'world', 'only', 'absolute', 'uniformity', 'homogeneity.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Adam & Steve

Unfortunately the pluses of this are more than a few times imbalanced by some of the following minuses:-An overage of what other review sites have called ""gross-out"" humor. I really could have stood the diarrhea sight-gag, had its use not been overloaded by the sometimes diarrhetic mouth of a stand-up club's master of ceremonies (Michael Panes, was it?) and of Parker Posey's character, herself, upon occasion. Why are such remarks, like the female-bestiality cracks in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" considered such fair game in humor these days? Puke!!-Perhaps a little over-reliance on Jewish ""sensibility-moments.""-Guess, overall, I just feel that Chester has been around long enough to: know better, turn out something better, just plain old be better. It can't have been inexpensive to roll out this product, so it just seems he could'a gotten a lot more for his buck (and we for ours).WHOA.....WHOA......WHOA.........STOPPpppp! You know what? I went back and ""re-looked"" this movie last night, and in the midst of my millionth laugh, it suddenly hit me that I hadn't really laughed any less the first night. Say, maybe I've been trying to make something too serious out of this little production, and that's not what it's about at all. It really doesn't have to be another ""Brokeback Mountain"" (as great as that was). Isn't it nice, instead, to have something that keeps our spirits up? Well, you bet.And we can have all the ""sensibility-moments"" they can throw at us......cause isn't there a good, old Hebrew word that just perfectly describes Adam?  Isn't it something like........Klutz (and a lovable one at that)?  And being ""sad-sacky,"" that can be funny too, can't it? Right on!Finally, on an even more positive note (for someone like me who's always placing gay kissing scenes*** under the old microscope), I'd have to judge that this production has not been afraid to give us a goodly number of 'osculating-lips-in-action' shots. Don't you agree? They weren't all perfectly aimed, but there were some really good ones.PS--So, congratulations Adam & Steve, on your wedding, and for being able to live in a world far removed from that of Jack & Ennis.***And for scenes in which ""lip-locks"" were done as well or better, try these: ""Just A Question Of Love"" / ""Latter Days"" / ""All Over The Guy"" / ""Brokeback Mountain"" / ""Maurice"" / sorry, gotta stop somewhere)",4,"""Adam & Steve in the Garden of Edxx.......Manhattan",1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,2612,"['Craig', 'Chester', 'Malcolm', 'Gets', 'particularly', 'latter', 'hunk', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'winsomely', 'huggable', '-he', 'so', 'right', 'home', 'so', 'comfortable', 'have', 'real', 'warm', 'moments', ""n't"", 'often', 'happen', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'days', 'Unfortunately', 'pluses', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'imbalanced', 'following', 'minuses', '-An', 'overage', 'what', 'other', 'review', 'sites', 'have', 'called', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'stood', 'diarrhea', 'sight-gag', 'had', 'use', 'not', 'been', 'overloaded', 'sometimes', 'diarrhetic', 'mouth', 'stand-up', 'club', 'master', 'ceremonies', 'Michael', 'Panes', 'was', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'character', 'occasion', 'Why', 'are', 'such', 'remarks', 'female-bestiality', 'cracks', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'considered', 'such', 'fair', 'game', 'humor', 'days', 'Puke', 'little', 'over-reliance', 'Jewish', 'sensibility-moments', '-Guess', 'overall', 'just', 'feel', 'Chester', 'been', 'long', 'enough', 'know', 'better', 'turn', 'out', 'something', 'better', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'be', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'inexpensive', 'roll', 'out', 'product', 'just', 'could', ""'"", 'gotten', 'lot', 'more', 'buck', 'ours', '.WHOA', '..WHOA', 'WHOA', 'STOPPpppp', 'know', 'what', 'went', 'back', 're-looked', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'midst', 'millionth', 'laugh', 'suddenly', 'hit', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'laughed', 'less', 'first', 'night', 'Say', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'make', 'something', 'too', 'serious', 'little', 'production', 'not', 'what', 'about', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'as', 'great', 'was', ""n't"", 'nice', 'instead', 'have', 'something', 'spirits', 'up', 'Well', 'bet.And', 'can', 'have', 'sensibility-moments', 'can', 'throw', 'cause', ""n't"", 'good', 'old', 'Hebrew', 'word', 'just', 'perfectly', 'Adam', ""n't"", 'something', '..Klutz', 'lovable', 'one', 'being', 'sad-sacky', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Right', 'Finally', 'even', 'more', 'positive', 'note', 'someone', 'who', 'always', 'placing', 'gay', 'kissing', 'scenes***', 'old', 'microscope', ""'d"", 'have', 'judge', 'production', 'not', 'been', 'afraid', 'give', 'goodly', 'number', ""'osculating-lips-in-action"", 'shots', 'Do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'were', ""n't"", 'perfectly', 'aimed', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'ones.PS', 'So', 'congratulations', 'Adam', 'Steve', 'wedding', 'being', 'able', 'live', 'world', 'far', 'removed', 'Jack', 'Ennis', '***And', 'scenes', 'lip-locks', 'were', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'better', 'try', 'Just', 'Question', 'Love', '/', 'Latter', 'Days', 'Guy', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', '/', 'Maurice', '/', 'sorry', 'got', 'ta', 'stop', 'somewhere']",Adam & Steve

Many of the gay bashing jokes fall flat and Parker Posey is wasted here and her character (a really bad stand-up comic) is painful to watch. On the other hand, half of the film is very enjoyable. It finally gets on track in the second half, but by that time it is just too late to make ammends. The two lead actors are good and most of the supporting actors are great - Sally Kirkland is very funny in a cameo and the ""family"" scenes are pretty funny. Better planning and editing could have resulted in a better film.",3,Missed opportunity,1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,828,"['film', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'well', 'succeeded', 'charming', 'romantic', 'gay', 'comedy', 'go', 'so', 'many', 'directions', 'up', 'being', 'disappointment', 'out', 'lines', 'John', 'Waters', 'film', 'crude', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'so', 'disgusting', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'continue', 'Many', 'gay', 'bashing', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'wasted', 'here', 'character', 'really', 'bad', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'painful', 'watch', 'other', 'hand', 'half', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'finally', 'track', 'second', 'half', 'time', 'just', 'too', 'late', 'make', 'ammends', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'most', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'Sally', 'Kirkland', 'very', 'funny', 'cameo', 'family', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Better', 'planning', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'resulted', 'better', 'film']",Adam & Steve
