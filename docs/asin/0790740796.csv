108204,AK0CENM3LUM28,0790740796,Amazon Customer,"[7, 9]","Just Cause / 085391362326*Spoilers*I bought this movie on speculation, assuming that anything involving both Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne couldn't possibly go wrong, but it turns out I was underestimating the power of a horrible, didactic plot.The movie starts out promisingly enough, with Connery in the role of a crusading law professor, out to right all the injustices of our death penalty driven legal system, and with Fishburne playing out the role of the dirty cop who breaks all the rules in order to take down the criminal - even if the 'criminal' is really innocent and the rules are broken in order to egregiously railroad the wrong man for a horrible crime.This is the stuff of good drama, and really the film-makers should have been satisfied with this. But, no, everything has to have a 'twist' these days, so after Connery uses his legal kung fu to break our innocent, railroaded victim out of jail, there's still a good 45 minutes left in the movie, so you just know that can't be the end of it. Indeed, somewhere it is written that if anyone is freed from prison more than 30 minutes before the movie ends, then they will inevitably be left holding the Whodunit bag at the end of the film (conversely, if anyone is sent to prison with 30 minutes remaining, they're either the wrong guy for the crime, or just a flunky for the ""real"" mastermind).Sure enough, all hell breaks loose immediately after judicial release, and Connery comes to realize what Fishburne was smart enough to clue in on an hour ago - the innocent jailbird isn't so innocent after all, and Fishburne was just doing what was necessary (""just cause"", get it?) in order to put a dangerous man behind bars. After being bloodied in battle, our pansy professor becomes a man, and presumably comes to realize that sometimes you have to brutally force a confession out of a dangerous man in order to protect all the innocent women and children of the world.Although I very much doubt that it was intentional, this movie eloquently drives home the point of why, exactly, police officers close to the victim (as Fishburne's character was in this case) should not take the lead on their cases. Despite the apparent implication that Fishburne's character had ""just cause"" to mistreat the suspect in the manner that he did, and to railroad over the proper legal process, Fishburne's character is the *real* villain here - because his reckless, irresponsible flaunting of the law and due legal process guaranteed that a dangerous man would be released again, to prey on the public until another 'chance' to lock him away properly appeared. We do not, thankfully, have a legal system based on the psychic abilities of impassioned police officers, and the rights of all citizens are threatened whenever anyone takes the law into their own hands by brutalizing suspects in police custody.Soapbox aside, much of this movie is ridiculous or out-right silly. Another 'twist' at the end is so beyond ridiculous that it deserves mention - the criminal's long-standing vendetta against Connery's wife is because when she locked him up without cause as a hot-shot prosecutor in her youth, he was castrated during his stay as a guest of the state. Now, considering that he was later *imprisoned* by the same state on a rape charge, you'd think that he might - just *might* - have attempted to use that little fact at trial to lessen suspicion on him. But that would have ruined the movie twist, so we can't have that.~ Ana Mardoll",2,Derivative,1262563200,"01 4, 2010",2010,3498,"['Just', 'Cause', '/', '085391362326*Spoilers*I', 'bought', 'movie', 'speculation', 'assuming', 'anything', 'involving', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'out', 'was', 'underestimating', 'power', 'horrible', 'didactic', 'plot.The', 'movie', 'out', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'Connery', 'role', 'crusading', 'law', 'professor', 'right', 'injustices', 'death', 'penalty', 'driven', 'legal', 'system', 'Fishburne', 'playing', 'out', 'role', 'dirty', 'cop', 'who', 'rules', 'order', 'take', 'down', 'criminal', 'even', ""'criminal"", 'really', 'innocent', 'rules', 'are', 'broken', 'order', 'egregiously', 'railroad', 'wrong', 'man', 'horrible', 'crime.This', 'stuff', 'good', 'drama', 'really', 'film-makers', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'satisfied', 'everything', 'have', ""'twist"", 'days', 'so', 'Connery', 'legal', 'kung', 'fu', 'break', 'innocent', 'railroaded', 'victim', 'jail', 'still', 'good', '45', 'minutes', 'left', 'movie', 'just', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'end', 'Indeed', 'written', 'anyone', 'freed', 'prison', 'more', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'then', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'left', 'holding', 'Whodunit', 'bag', 'end', 'film', 'conversely', 'anyone', 'sent', 'prison', '30', 'minutes', 'remaining', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'guy', 'crime', 'just', 'flunky', 'real', 'mastermind', '.Sure', 'enough', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'immediately', 'judicial', 'release', 'Connery', 'realize', 'what', 'Fishburne', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'clue', 'hour', 'innocent', 'jailbird', ""n't"", 'so', 'innocent', 'Fishburne', 'was', 'just', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'necessary', 'just', 'cause', 'get', 'order', 'put', 'dangerous', 'man', 'bars', 'being', 'bloodied', 'battle', 'pansy', 'professor', 'man', 'presumably', 'realize', 'sometimes', 'have', 'brutally', 'force', 'confession', 'dangerous', 'man', 'order', 'protect', 'innocent', 'women', 'children', 'world.Although', 'very', 'much', 'doubt', 'was', 'intentional', 'movie', 'eloquently', 'home', 'point', 'why', 'exactly', 'police', 'officers', 'close', 'victim', 'Fishburne', 'character', 'was', 'case', 'should', 'not', 'take', 'lead', 'cases', 'apparent', 'implication', 'Fishburne', 'character', 'had', 'just', 'cause', 'mistreat', 'suspect', 'manner', 'did', 'railroad', 'proper', 'legal', 'process', 'Fishburne', 'character', '*real*', 'villain', 'here', 'reckless', 'irresponsible', 'flaunting', 'law', 'due', 'legal', 'process', 'guaranteed', 'dangerous', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'again', 'prey', 'public', ""'chance"", 'lock', 'away', 'properly', 'appeared', 'do', 'not', 'thankfully', 'have', 'legal', 'system', 'based', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'impassioned', 'police', 'officers', 'rights', 'citizens', 'are', 'threatened', 'anyone', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'brutalizing', 'suspects', 'police', 'custody.Soapbox', 'aside', 'much', 'movie', 'ridiculous', 'out-right', 'silly', ""'twist"", 'end', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'mention', 'criminal', 'long-standing', 'vendetta', 'Connery', 'wife', 'when', 'locked', 'up', 'cause', 'hot-shot', 'prosecutor', 'youth', 'was', 'castrated', 'stay', 'guest', 'state', 'Now', 'considering', 'was', 'later', '*imprisoned*', 'same', 'state', 'rape', 'charge', ""'d"", 'think', 'might', 'just', '*might*', 'have', 'attempted', 'use', 'little', 'fact', 'trial', 'lessen', 'suspicion', 'would', 'have', 'ruined', 'movie', 'twist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'that.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

108206,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0790740796,Austin Somlo,"[1, 4]","Viewed: 1/08Rate: 61/08: Before I comment on the movie, I want to get one thing out of the way. Who cares that the child is Scarlett Johansson? Now...Just Cause is a good, gripping thriller but has too many faults. Gosh, the most glaring fault of the film is the casting of Kate Capshaw. I thought I had seen the last of her in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. This is my theory that should be proven valid on how she got the role for Just Cause. Sean Connery once played Indiana Jones' father during Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and now he is the executive producer for Just Cause. So, somewhere in his mind, he just thought of Kate Capshaw and decided to give her the role in his picture out of his respect for Steven Spielberg. Brilliant, eh? In other words, Just Cause should have been better without her, but the ending of the film reminded me too much of Cape Fear (I am not sure which version or if it was both). The acting is slightly tacky, but a good performance came out of Laurence Fishburne. Only Kate Capshaw's acting left me shaking my head and wondering how the heck she made it to Hollywood or simply just became Steven Spielberg's wife. She has forever cemented her name on my list of worst actresses ever. Blair Underwood didn't do anything for me, so I was left, thinking of him as mainly ""perfunctory."" On the other hand, I am quite impressed with the story: the clever twist, the layers of the plot, and the tautness of it. What hurt the film was the stupidity of it. First of all, you have a black dude who went to Cornell. Okay, now...I don't get why the black dude would have anything further with the professor aka the white sap fool after he had kidnapped his wife and his girl. Another thing I don't get the most is why the black dude practically went back to the same location where he did the girl in 1985. He made it too easy for himself to get caught. This should've never happened at all. I was surprised when Tanny Brown and the professor would return to that location I spoke of but without any cops. Then again, I keep thinking of Cape Fear all over again right now. I know it sounds stupid, but I couldn't believe how dumb the professor got baited like ""hook, line, and skinner."" If it had happened in a Hitchcock film, I would have accepted it, but...films of today? No way. Ed Harris overacted this one, and it was almost just as bad as Ed Norton in Primal Fear. I like to review the phone book hitting that occurred in the beginning of Just Cause. That one was comical as it happened twice already. Now, when the first one happened, I seemed to notice how delayed that Blair Underwood before he got hit by the phone book. So, I decided to pause during that moment and slo-mo it. Wilcox, the white cop, swung the phone book but did not make a contact with Underwood's head. So, I froze bits of that moment, and Underwood did not fall at all yet. When the pendulum was made, he hasn't fallen yet. Finally, at the end of the pendulum, Underwood fakes it and fall down as something from God had hit him. Not only had this happened once but twice! Come on, Arne...why don't you instruct your actor to hit the silly head of his fellow actor to get it over with? They are getting paid big bucks...please, spare the tears. Was Just Cause meant to be a parody of lawyers in South or professors of North? Either way, Just Cause became a prejudicing piece of work. The funniest thing out of this mess, in my view, is when all has been said and done. The professor is left with this sole thought on his mind, ""I can't believe I married a total b****!"" Well...that's Just Cause for you, baby.",3,Why is Kate Capshaw Still Acting?,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,3631,"['Viewed', '1/08Rate', '61/08', 'comment', 'movie', 'want', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'way', 'Who', 'child', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Now', 'Just', 'Cause', 'good', 'gripping', 'thriller', 'too', 'many', 'faults', 'Gosh', 'most', 'glaring', 'fault', 'film', 'casting', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'last', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Temple', 'Doom', 'theory', 'should', 'be', 'proven', 'valid', 'how', 'got', 'role', 'Just', 'Cause', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'once', 'played', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'father', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'now', 'executive', 'producer', 'Just', 'Cause', 'So', 'somewhere', 'mind', 'just', 'thought', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'decided', 'give', 'role', 'picture', 'respect', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Brilliant', 'eh', 'other', 'words', 'Just', 'Cause', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'ending', 'film', 'reminded', 'too', 'much', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'version', 'was', 'acting', 'slightly', 'tacky', 'good', 'performance', 'came', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Only', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'acting', 'left', 'shaking', 'head', 'wondering', 'how', 'heck', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'simply', 'just', 'became', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'wife', 'forever', 'cemented', 'name', 'list', 'worst', 'actresses', 'ever', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'so', 'was', 'left', 'thinking', 'mainly', 'perfunctory', 'other', 'hand', 'am', 'quite', 'impressed', 'story', 'clever', 'twist', 'layers', 'plot', 'tautness', 'What', 'hurt', 'film', 'was', 'stupidity', 'First', 'all', 'have', 'black', 'dude', 'who', 'went', 'Cornell', 'Okay', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'black', 'dude', 'would', 'have', 'anything', 'further', 'professor', 'white', 'sap', 'fool', 'had', 'kidnapped', 'wife', 'girl', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'most', 'why', 'black', 'dude', 'practically', 'went', 'back', 'same', 'location', 'where', 'did', 'girl', '1985', 'made', 'too', 'easy', 'get', 'caught', 'should', ""'ve"", 'never', 'happened', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'Tanny', 'Brown', 'professor', 'would', 'return', 'location', 'spoke', 'cops', 'Then', 'again', 'keep', 'thinking', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'right', 'now', 'know', 'stupid', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'dumb', 'professor', 'got', 'baited', 'hook', 'line', 'skinner', 'had', 'happened', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'accepted', 'films', 'today', 'way', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'overacted', 'one', 'was', 'almost', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'like', 'review', 'phone', 'book', 'hitting', 'occurred', 'beginning', 'Just', 'Cause', 'one', 'was', 'comical', 'happened', 'twice', 'already', 'Now', 'when', 'first', 'one', 'happened', 'seemed', 'notice', 'how', 'delayed', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'got', 'hit', 'phone', 'book', 'So', 'decided', 'pause', 'moment', 'slo-mo', 'Wilcox', 'white', 'cop', 'swung', 'phone', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'contact', 'Underwood', 'head', 'So', 'froze', 'bits', 'moment', 'Underwood', 'did', 'not', 'fall', 'yet', 'When', 'pendulum', 'was', 'made', ""n't"", 'fallen', 'yet', 'Finally', 'end', 'pendulum', 'Underwood', 'fall', 'down', 'something', 'God', 'had', 'hit', 'Not', 'only', 'had', 'happened', 'once', 'twice', 'Come', 'Arne', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'instruct', 'actor', 'hit', 'silly', 'head', 'fellow', 'actor', 'get', 'over', 'are', 'getting', 'paid', 'big', 'bucks', 'please', 'spare', 'tears', 'Was', 'Just', 'Cause', 'meant', 'be', 'parody', 'lawyers', 'South', 'professors', 'North', 'way', 'Just', 'Cause', 'became', 'prejudicing', 'piece', 'work', 'funniest', 'thing', 'mess', 'view', 'when', 'been', 'said', 'done', 'professor', 'left', 'sole', 'thought', 'mind', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'married', 'total', 'b****', 'Well', 'Just', 'Cause', 'baby']",N/A

Vegan,"[3, 5]","On the back of the case of this movie, it says that it's the best thriller since Silence of The Lambs; while I don't agree with that statement, Just Cause was a great thriller.The first thing we think when a young black man is hauled to the local precinct for interrogation is police brutality. After all, sheriff Tanny Brown, and police officer Wilcox, show no mercy in beating Bobby Earl, who is accused of killing a young white girl. We feel horrified by what the officers do to the prisoner.Then, the scene changes. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother is sent north to ask a distinguished Harvard professor, a retired lawyer, the young man wants Paul Armstrong to defend him. She old woman is convincing enough for Armstrong to take a look at the case. He is also convinced of the young man's innocence.Things are not exactly what we thought they were. When Blair Sullivan, a man who is serving time in the same facility as Bobby Earl, comes forward to tell about how he is connected to the young girl's murder, and changes the dynamics of the case. The way it plays in the movie, it serves to confuse the viewer and distract Armstrong from arriving at the truth.This thriller is made enjoyable by Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, makes a fine impression as the Sheriff who, as far as we can see, is guilty of abusing his prisoner. Ed Harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors.

When a Women comes to him, claiming her Son has been falsely sent to Death Row for Murder, Paul can't help but get involved. He heads to the Little Southern Town were it all took place, and begins his Own Investigation. He Inevitably runs into local resistance, namely the town sheriff, Tanny Brown. (Lawrence Fishburn) When Others also start to believe Armstrong may be right, Tanny is never swayed.""Just Cause"" never really gets Boring, but it doesn't get to Exciting either. Ed Harris' Hannibal Lector-ish performance is a High point and Lawrence Fishburn brings Welcome Tension to the Proceedings. Connery is as good as ever, though he isn't given much to do, Acting wise. Blair Underwood is Very Convincing as the man on Death Row, he convinces the audience as Easy as he convinces Connery. Kate Capshaw is the Weak Link in the Acting Department, and it's Not Really Her Fault. She plays Connery's wife...

108213,A1S3C5OFU508P3,0790740796,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","This movie has all the components of a formulaic tale about a black man unjustly arrested for the murder of a young white girl. A college educated black man in a small town in Florida is arrested when a young white girl is raped and brutally murdered. The local sheriff and his deputy beat him for 22 hours and extort a confession out of him. The only unusual difference is that while the deputy is white, the sheriff is black.Sean Connery plays a Harvard Law professor who is adamantly opposed to the death penalty and he is introduced taking that position in a debate. The black man's grandmother has traveled up from Florida to plead with Connery to take her grandson's case before he is executed. After being shamed by his ex-prosecutor wife, Connery agrees to look into it. Once there, he finds several inconsistencies in the evidence, but time and again he encounters people who strongly and sometimes physically encourage him to let matters lie. The attorney who defended the black man openly admits to Connery that he lost business for defending the man and that he would have probably had to have left town if he had achieved an acquittal.Connery persists and gets what he feels is a just verdict, which only begins the development of the true story, which takes many convoluted twists. These gyrations will keep your mind racing as you try to anticipate what will be the next movement.As always, Sean Connery turns in an excellent performance. However, the stars of the movie are Lawrence Fishburne as the sheriff and Ed Harris as a deranged serial murder. Harris is spectacular as a man who is truly criminally insane, yet can when necessary be very rational and calculating. I enjoyed the movie, Connery avoided slipping into any dramatic hero persona; I thought he played the role a little too passively. However, that is just my experience is seeing him in the hero's role. In nearly every way he responded as a Harvard Law professor would.",4,"It begins with a formula for predictability, but then shifts into an unpredictable thriller",1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,1954,"['movie', 'components', 'formulaic', 'tale', 'black', 'man', 'unjustly', 'arrested', 'murder', 'young', 'white', 'girl', 'college', 'educated', 'black', 'man', 'small', 'town', 'Florida', 'arrested', 'when', 'young', 'white', 'girl', 'raped', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'local', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'beat', '22', 'hours', 'extort', 'confession', 'only', 'unusual', 'difference', 'deputy', 'white', 'sheriff', 'black.Sean', 'Connery', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'professor', 'who', 'adamantly', 'opposed', 'death', 'penalty', 'introduced', 'taking', 'position', 'debate', 'black', 'man', 'grandmother', 'traveled', 'up', 'Florida', 'plead', 'Connery', 'take', 'grandson', 'case', 'executed', 'being', 'shamed', 'ex-prosecutor', 'wife', 'Connery', 'look', 'Once', 'there', 'several', 'inconsistencies', 'evidence', 'time', 'again', 'people', 'who', 'strongly', 'sometimes', 'physically', 'encourage', 'let', 'matters', 'lie', 'attorney', 'who', 'defended', 'black', 'man', 'openly', 'Connery', 'lost', 'business', 'defending', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'had', 'have', 'left', 'town', 'had', 'achieved', 'acquittal.Connery', 'persists', 'what', 'just', 'verdict', 'only', 'development', 'true', 'story', 'many', 'convoluted', 'twists', 'gyrations', 'will', 'keep', 'mind', 'racing', 'try', 'anticipate', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'movement.As', 'always', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'excellent', 'performance', 'However', 'stars', 'movie', 'are', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'sheriff', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'deranged', 'serial', 'murder', 'Harris', 'spectacular', 'man', 'who', 'truly', 'criminally', 'insane', 'yet', 'can', 'when', 'necessary', 'be', 'very', 'rational', 'calculating', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Connery', 'avoided', 'slipping', 'dramatic', 'hero', 'persona', 'thought', 'played', 'role', 'little', 'too', 'passively', 'However', 'just', 'experience', 'seeing', 'hero', 'role', 'nearly', 'way', 'responded', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'professor', 'would']",N/A

108220,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0790740796,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","To fight against the death penalty is a just cause. Everyone who is sane in Europe would think so. In the USA everything is different. The film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving American justice. A young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case. But the film has a sequel. Justice in the USA is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance. Miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance. One person in the local Public Attorney Offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges. This Public Attorney's officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free. But he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire. He hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance. But he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls. He apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys. One day the local cops follow their intuition, guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl, and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of. They beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and Russian roulette. He confesses. Sent to death row, he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in Massachusetts who is the husband of the Local Public Attorney's representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails. It will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice, police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality, some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance. To charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice. The best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention, just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence, which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial, hence easily discardable, with a good lawyer. The film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we don't want to make a mistake, which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief Americans are supposed to have: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."" (Declaration of Independence) Life is an unalienable Right that was given to man by his Creator, which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away. Only God can take the life of a person away. The death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have. Even if we do not evoke God, we cannot justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance, and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace. If vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty. And there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of Happiness but of vengeance.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",4,Let alligators clean the plate,1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,3871,"['fight', 'death', 'penalty', 'just', 'cause', 'Everyone', 'who', 'sane', 'Europe', 'would', 'think', 'so', 'USA', 'everything', 'different', 'film', 'demonstrate', 'first', 'stage', 'justice', 'can', 'be', 'won', 'racist', 'bigot', 'death', 'penalty', 'craving', 'American', 'justice', 'young', 'man', 'freed', 'death', 'row', 'thanks', 'law', 'professor', 'who', 'went', 'back', 'defense', 'counseling', 'particular', 'case', 'film', 'sequel', 'Justice', 'USA', 'entirely', 'governed', 'aim', 'vengeance', 'Miscarriage', 'justice', 'just', 'same', 'governed', 'vengeance', 'One', 'person', 'local', 'Public', 'Attorney', 'Offfice', 'young', 'man', 'prosecuted', 'false', 'charges', 'Public', 'Attorney', 'officer', 'charges', 'while', 'young', 'man', 'out', 'free', 'college', 'scholarship', 'castrated', 'vengeful', 'people', 'whom', 'never', 'smoke', 'fire', 'shame', 'swears', 'get', 'vengeance', 'also', 'satisfy', 'sexual', 'needs', 'are', 'more', 'mental', 'hormonal', 'sure', 'even', 'stronger', 'mental', 'longer', 'hormonal', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'little', 'girls', 'apparently', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'same', 'kind', 'preys', 'One', 'day', 'local', 'cops', 'follow', 'intuition', 'guided', 'vague', 'circumstantial', 'elements', 'assassination', 'young', 'girl', 'arrest', 'young', 'chap', 'are', 'speaking', 'beat', 'up', 'interrogate', '22', 'hours', 'nothing', 'blows', 'blows', 'telephone', 'books', 'guns', 'Russian', 'roulette', 'Sent', 'death', 'row', 'grandmother', 'go', 'get', 'law', 'professor', 'Massachusetts', 'who', 'husband', 'Local', 'Public', 'Attorney', 'representative', 'had', 'falsely', 'prosecuted', 'years', 'ago', 'vengeance', 'rails', 'will', 'fail', 'as', 'soon', 'one', 'line', 'justice', 'police', 'work', 'other', 'security', 'forces', 'steps', 'line', 'absolute', 'legality', 'unjust', 'act', 'done', 'can', 'ruin', 'even', 'best', 'accusation', 'case', 'can', 'nourish', 'worst', 'deepest', 'imaginable', 'thirst', 'vengeance', 'charge', 'someone', 'circumstantial', 'elements', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'let', 'circumstantial', 'elements', 'ruin', 'work', 'police', 'justice', 'best', 'intentions', 'police', 'side', 'are', 'ruined', 'personal', 'involvement', 'vengeful', 'intention', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'life', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'jeopardized', 'circumstantial', 'elements', 'inflated', 'size', 'evidence', 'turn', 'will', 'jeopardize', 'whole', 'case', 'being', 'just', 'circumstantial', 'hence', 'easily', 'discardable', 'good', 'lawyer', 'film', 'then', 'deep', 'reflection', 'necessity', 'respect', 'standards', 'regulations', 'police', 'justice', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'mistake', 'turn', 'course', 'not', 'justify', 'death', 'penalty', 'anyway', 'deepest', 'belief', 'Americans', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'hold', 'truths', 'be', 'self-evident', 'men', 'are', 'created', 'equal', 'are', 'endowed', 'Creator', 'certain', 'unalienable', 'Rights', 'are', 'Life', 'Liberty', 'pursuit', 'Happiness', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'Life', 'unalienable', 'Right', 'was', 'given', 'man', 'Creator', 'one', 'one', 'who', 'gave', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'Only', 'God', 'can', 'take', 'life', 'person', 'away', 'death', 'penalty', 'arrogant', 'appropriation', 'power', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'Even', 'do', 'not', 'evoke', 'God', 'can', 'not', 'justify', 'death', 'penalty', 'act', 'vengeance', 'here', 'film', 'shows', 'vengeance', 'worst', 'possible', 'motivation', 'rendition', 'justice', 'establishment', 'public', 'peace', 'vengeance', 'pushed', 'other', 'justification', 'death', 'penalty', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'mistake', 'pursuit', 'not', 'Happiness', 'vengeance.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

108230,A1U360OMVQRPUB,0790740796,Mel Odom,"[6, 9]","Sean Connery stars as Harvard law professor Paul Armstrong in this cunning and twisting story of primeval evil and revenge.  Bobby Earl is locked up in prison for the horrific rape and murder of an 11-year old girl in Ochopee, Florida.  Bobby Earl's letter, delivered to Armstrong by Bobby Earl's grandmother, pulls the law professor into Florida where he reopens the investigation of the murder.  While he's working, discovering how flimsy the evidence was against Bobby Earl, Armstrong is stalked by the two policemen that put the young man away.  Tanny Brown, the lead policeman, is convinced that Bobby Earl is guilty, and isn't at all remorse about putting a gun inside the defendant's mouth to exact a confession.  Armstrong's investigation leads him back to the prison where Bobby Earl is being held, and to the madman serial killer, Blair Sullivan, who is going to be executed within days.  Armstrong meets resistance at every turn, but the surprises are even more daunting.  Only days into the case, Armstrong finds out that Bobby Earl was brought up on kidnapping charges before the murder, and that the prosecuting attorney was none other than Armstrong's own wife who urged him to take the case.Sean Connery is hands-down one of the best actors in the business.  Watching him work so effortlessly, yet hitting every nuance and pulling the audience into the story, is poetry in motion.  Besides starring as the original James Bond, he's played in dozens of movies, portraying serious roles as well as comic relief.  Lawrence Fishburne, Tanny Brown in the movie, is known to most fans as Morpheus in THE MATRIX, but he's done several crime thrillers in addtion to this one, including ALWAYS OUTNUMBERED, HOODLUM, FLED, and DEEP COVER.  Ed Harris, who starred in THE ABYSS and THE ROCK, plays deranged serial killer Blair Sullivan.  Blair Underwood, L. A. LAW and DEEP IMPACT, plays Bobby Earl.JUST CAUSE, based on the novel by John Katzenbach, is a slick, speeding bullet of a movie.  The pacing is dynamically charged, and the plot twist reveals are staged to set the viewer up for senses-shattering one-two deliveries.  The thriller fan will see some of the twists coming, but others will come out of left field yet maintain perfect sense.  The ones that are seen coming bring the stomach-turning anxiety of watching a car wreck in motion and being unable to look away.  Every character in the movie outside of Paul Armstrong has hidden depths and agendas of his and her own that play out against the main plot.  Sean Connery, as always, delivers an outstanding performance.  Fishburne leaves the impression that he could have been Tanny Brown had life gone differently for him.  Blair Underwood plays Bobby Earl to a T, coming across as a guy who's just been unlucky in life.  But the biggest gut-churning experience of the film is Ed Harris' portrayal of Blair Sullivan, which guarantees some uneasy moments long after the movie is over.The only real fault in the movie is the recovery of the missing murder weapon after eight years.  Armstrong looks for the knife himself after Tanny Brown tells him he's on a wild goose chase.  Yet Tanny comes with him and they ultimately recover the blade.  Instead of calling in a crime scene investigation, as most viewers know would have to be done, Tanny takes the weapon into custody himself.  Also, follow up DNA work would have been nice to see, to further confirm the evidence.  With all the DVD packaging that's coming out these days, behind-the-scenes featurettes or interviews with Connery or the other actors would have been a natural.  DVD fans have come to expect these things and not having them on JUST CAUSE was a bit of a disappointment.JUST CAUSE is a fabulous movie and a definite must for thriller fans.  The addition of Sean Connery and the sterling performance by Ed Harris are icing on the cake.  Anyone who enjoyed SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, L. A. CONFIDENTIAL, or THE USUAL SUSPECTS will also enjoy this DVD.",5,Evil in the Everglades,1022544000,"05 28, 2002",2002,3980,"['Sean', 'Connery', 'stars', 'Harvard', 'law', 'professor', 'Paul', 'Armstrong', 'cunning', 'twisting', 'story', 'primeval', 'evil', 'revenge', 'Bobby', 'Earl', 'locked', 'up', 'prison', 'horrific', 'rape', 'murder', '11-year', 'old', 'girl', 'Ochopee', 'Florida', 'Bobby', 'Earl', 'letter', 'delivered', 'Armstrong', 'Bobby', 'Earl', 'grandmother', 'law', 'professor', 'Florida', 'where', 'investigation', 'murder', 'working', 'discovering', 'how', 'flimsy', 'evidence', 'was', 'Bobby', 'Earl', 'Armstrong', 'stalked', 'two', 'policemen', 'put', 'young', 'man', 'away', 'Tanny', 'Brown', 'lead', 'policeman', 'convinced', 'Bobby', 'Earl', 'guilty', ""n't"", 'remorse', 'putting', 'gun', 'defendant', 'mouth', 'exact', 'confession', 'Armstrong', 'investigation', 'back', 'prison', 'where', 'Bobby', 'Earl', 'being', 'held', 'madman', 'serial', 'killer', 'Blair', 'Sullivan', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'executed', 'days', 'Armstrong', 'resistance', 'turn', 'surprises', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'daunting', 'Only', 'days', 'case', 'Armstrong', 'out', 'Bobby', 'Earl', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'kidnapping', 'charges', 'murder', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'Armstrong', 'own', 'wife', 'who', 'urged', 'take', 'case.Sean', 'Connery', 'hands-down', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'business', 'Watching', 'work', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'yet', 'hitting', 'nuance', 'pulling', 'audience', 'story', 'poetry', 'motion', 'Besides', 'starring', 'original', 'James', 'Bond', 'played', 'dozens', 'movies', 'portraying', 'serious', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'comic', 'relief', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'Tanny', 'Brown', 'movie', 'known', 'most', 'fans', 'Morpheus', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'done', 'several', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'addtion', 'one', 'including', 'ALWAYS', 'OUTNUMBERED', 'HOODLUM', 'FLED', 'DEEP', 'COVER', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'starred', 'THE', 'ABYSS', 'THE', 'ROCK', 'deranged', 'serial', 'killer', 'Blair', 'Sullivan', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'L.', 'A', 'LAW', 'DEEP', 'IMPACT', 'Bobby', 'Earl.JUST', 'CAUSE', 'based', 'novel', 'John', 'Katzenbach', 'slick', 'speeding', 'bullet', 'movie', 'pacing', 'dynamically', 'charged', 'plot', 'twist', 'reveals', 'are', 'staged', 'set', 'viewer', 'up', 'senses-shattering', 'one-two', 'deliveries', 'thriller', 'fan', 'will', 'see', 'twists', 'coming', 'others', 'will', 'come', 'left', 'field', 'yet', 'maintain', 'perfect', 'sense', 'ones', 'are', 'seen', 'coming', 'bring', 'stomach-turning', 'anxiety', 'watching', 'car', 'wreck', 'motion', 'being', 'unable', 'look', 'away', 'Every', 'character', 'movie', 'Paul', 'Armstrong', 'hidden', 'depths', 'agendas', 'own', 'play', 'out', 'main', 'plot', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'always', 'delivers', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Fishburne', 'impression', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Tanny', 'Brown', 'had', 'life', 'gone', 'differently', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'Bobby', 'Earl', 'T', 'coming', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'unlucky', 'life', 'biggest', 'gut-churning', 'experience', 'film', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'portrayal', 'Blair', 'Sullivan', 'uneasy', 'moments', 'long', 'movie', 'over.The', 'only', 'real', 'fault', 'movie', 'recovery', 'missing', 'murder', 'weapon', 'eight', 'years', 'Armstrong', 'knife', 'Tanny', 'Brown', 'wild', 'goose', 'chase', 'Tanny', 'ultimately', 'recover', 'blade', 'Instead', 'calling', 'crime', 'scene', 'investigation', 'most', 'viewers', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'done', 'Tanny', 'weapon', 'custody', 'Also', 'follow', 'up', 'DNA', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'further', 'confirm', 'evidence', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'coming', 'out', 'days', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'interviews', 'Connery', 'other', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'natural', 'DVD', 'fans', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'things', 'not', 'having', 'JUST', 'CAUSE', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointment.JUST', 'CAUSE', 'fabulous', 'movie', 'definite', 'must', 'thriller', 'fans', 'addition', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'sterling', 'performance', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'are', 'icing', 'cake', 'Anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'L.', 'A', 'CONFIDENTIAL', 'THE', 'USUAL', 'SUSPECTS', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'DVD']",N/A

Sean Connery does well in his role as a Harvard law professor asked to prove a death row inmate's innocence.  Seems his confession came about as a result of a violent coercion from the town's two law officers.  Throw in a subplot involving Connery's lawyer wife, a demented Hannibal Lechter-like serial killer, and lots of confusion about the innocence or guilt of both the accused and/or the law officer.  The movie gives itself away with the quick vindication of the accused; you know something is going on, or the movie would have been over.  The main problem in the end, is that we never really understand exactly why the killer chose to kill this little girl, and just how far someone would go to exact revenge.  You can't really fault the cast, though:  Kate Capshaw as the wife does well with what little she is given to do; Laurence Fishburne is appropriately smarmy and unlikeable; Ed Harris has a field day as the demented serial killer; and we even get glorious ""cameos"" from future Oscar hopeful Scarlett Johanson; George Plimpton, Chris Sarandon, Daniel J. Travanti, Hope Lange, Ned Beatty and Kevin McCarthy.

But ultimately, like the book it's based off of, I really can't say I outright enjoyed it.  Oh sure, there are moments worth watching, but there are just too many things that diminish the enjoyment.  For example, from his first line in, Sean Connery comes off as a brilliant lawyer and professor but I found his stance on capital punishment off-putting.  I am also against the death penalty but I don't think I could readily answer the question of how I'd feel about the matter if it'd been my own wife as Mr. Connery did in a debate right at the beginning.  He automatically stated he'd still be against the punishment without any real emotion behind his answer, which, given the context of the question, made it off-putting...note that this same question and answer played a major role in sinking Governor Dukakis's 1988 Presidential campaign.  Anyway, after that initial poor introduction, Mr. Connery's character was never able to gain any real form of support from me.  On the upside, Ed Harris made for an enjoyable villain...sort of a redneck, Bible-quoting Hannibal Lector type.  Had they tweaked that character a little bit, Mr. Harris might have truely been able to give a performance comparible to Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Nevertheless, he was the highlight of the film.  Blair Underwood's character, the ""innocent"" death row inmate, may have looked interesting on paper (ivy league schooling, etc.) but the performance added nothing special to this man, making it difficult to root for him.  Laurence Fishburne was enjoyable as the conflicted sheriff who believes and knows so many different things.  His performance truely felt genuine, especially when he explained his personal connection to the young victim.  Overall, this film is one where you can come for the subject matter, but you won't get much more.  I will say it wrapped up many plot points much better than the book of the same name.

Connery plays a liberal, anti-death penalty law professor who gets talked into trying for a new appeal in the case.  Turns out that the convict was indeed beaten and coerced into making his confession in what was otherwise a fairly thin case against him.  But all is not what it seems, and more would be telling.

Just Cause gave me much more than I expected because I thought it was over before it ended.  It had petered out into a smelly Everglades methane swamp of political correctness, and I thought it was all over but the discreditable credits.  Then Just Cause really began.  It want from swamp gas to a film that's as sharp as a shiv.Connery and Fishburne are good in both parts of the movie, smelly beginning and incisive end.  Ed Harris's performance, however, is over the top and literally off the wall.  It's a beautiful thing.  (I'm usually offended that Hollywood tricks out its sickest sickos with the accoutrements of Christianity, something Hollywood knows it can get away with because Christians are too polite to riot & 'necklace' producers, directors, and actors.  Having the Harris character declaim from the Book of Job, though, makes sense.

Bobby Earl Ferguson is arrested by officers Tanny Brown and J. T. Wilcox, who proceed to beat Bobby into confessing to the murder. Bobby is placed on trial, where Bobby's defense attorney McNair puts up a lousy defense for Bobby, and Bobby is sentenced to be executed. Now, eight years later, Bobby hands a letter to his grandmother Evangeline and asks Evangeline to go to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to hire Harvard law professor Paul Armstrong to clear Bobby's name. At Harvard, Paul is attacking capital punishment in a campus debate, when Evangeline arrives and hands the letter to Paul. Paul goes home, where his wife Laurie is throwing a birthday party for their young daughter Katey. Laurie reads the letter and she encourages Paul to take the case, even though he hasn't practiced law in 25 years. Paul, Laurie, and Katey head to Florida, where Paul meets Bobby in the prison. Bobby tells Paul his side of the story and what Tanny and Wilcox did. Paul begins to believe that Bobby was railroaded. Bobby tells Paul to speak to Blair Sullivan, a man who is also on death row. Blair gives Paul some clues that could prove Bobby's innocence,  and Blair's own guilt. But in the process of trying to clear Bobby, Paul learns some disturbing truths about Bobby, putting Paul and his family in a fight for their lives. ""Just Cause"" is a psychological thriller about the American justice system in general, and capital punishment in particular. There are several plot twists which will surprise you, and towards the end of the movie, the action really starts to set in. Sean Connery is reliable as the stout, solid professor Armstrong, and as the centerpiece of the movie, he is totally convincing. But as the dubious police officer Tanny Brown, it is Laurence Fishburne who truly excels.  A solid thriller that delivers the goods.",5,Just Cause (Snap Case),1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,1920,"['1986', 'Ochopee', 'Florida', '11-year-old', 'Joanie', 'Shriver', 'kidnapped', 'raped', 'murdered', 'Bobby', 'Earl', 'Ferguson', 'arrested', 'officers', 'Tanny', 'Brown', 'J.', 'T.', 'Wilcox', 'who', 'proceed', 'beat', 'Bobby', 'confessing', 'murder', 'Bobby', 'placed', 'trial', 'where', 'Bobby', 'defense', 'attorney', 'McNair', 'up', 'lousy', 'defense', 'Bobby', 'Bobby', 'sentenced', 'be', 'executed', 'Now', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'Bobby', 'letter', 'grandmother', 'Evangeline', 'Evangeline', 'go', 'Cambridge', 'Massachusetts', 'hire', 'Harvard', 'law', 'professor', 'Paul', 'Armstrong', 'clear', 'Bobby', 'name', 'Harvard', 'Paul', 'attacking', 'capital', 'punishment', 'campus', 'debate', 'when', 'Evangeline', 'letter', 'Paul', 'Paul', 'home', 'where', 'wife', 'Laurie', 'throwing', 'birthday', 'party', 'young', 'daughter', 'Katey', 'Laurie', 'letter', 'Paul', 'take', 'case', 'even', ""n't"", 'practiced', 'law', '25', 'years', 'Paul', 'Laurie', 'Katey', 'head', 'Florida', 'where', 'Paul', 'Bobby', 'prison', 'Bobby', 'Paul', 'side', 'story', 'what', 'Tanny', 'Wilcox', 'did', 'Paul', 'believe', 'Bobby', 'was', 'railroaded', 'Bobby', 'Paul', 'speak', 'Blair', 'Sullivan', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'death', 'row', 'Blair', 'Paul', 'clues', 'could', 'prove', 'Bobby', 'innocence', 'Blair', 'own', 'guilt', 'process', 'trying', 'clear', 'Bobby', 'Paul', 'disturbing', 'truths', 'Bobby', 'putting', 'Paul', 'family', 'fight', 'lives', 'Just', 'Cause', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'American', 'justice', 'system', 'general', 'capital', 'punishment', 'particular', 'are', 'several', 'plot', 'twists', 'will', 'surprise', 'end', 'movie', 'action', 'really', 'set', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'reliable', 'stout', 'solid', 'professor', 'Armstrong', 'centerpiece', 'movie', 'totally', 'convincing', 'dubious', 'police', 'officer', 'Tanny', 'Brown', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'truly', 'excels', 'solid', 'thriller', 'goods']",N/A
