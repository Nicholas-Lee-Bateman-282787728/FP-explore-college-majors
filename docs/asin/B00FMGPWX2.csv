1672165,A3W3RX6IVRQNZG,B00FMGPWX2,Bureau,"[1, 1]","Does Black Water Vampire borrow from more successful horror movies?  I wouldn't call it 'borrowing.'  Lots of good films borrow.  Troll Hunter borrowed from the Blair Witch Project, which in turn borrowed from Cannibal Holocaust.  While these films were obviously influenced by other films, none of them outright plagiarized, which is more what this felt like.  I suspect they simply took the Blair Witch script and rewrote it, careful to change just enough to avoid copyright infringement.  While this was enough to placate the legal system, I feel that if this script were turned into a high school drama course, the writer would be called out on academic dishonesty.Did it stop there?  Oh no. They also threw in rubbery bat-men from Coppola's Dracula (and a dozen other films at this point,) and tacked on a spooky homage to &#34;Freddy's Coming for You&#34; because hey, it's not like we want any semblance of realism in a lost tapes movie.  Still, Blair Witch was obviously the main focus of this opus.This is sad, really, as if there's one thing they should have borrowed from Blair Witch, it would have been its genuinely creepy, gritty atmosphere.  Black Water Vampire came across as too polished.  You could tell that the lighting was staged, the sound had been edited (and a very obtrusive soundbite of an owl hooting foleyed into almost every night scene, because hey, owls are SPOOOOKY,) that the characters had proper camera harnesses to reduce the kinetosis-inducing shake common to the lost tape genre, and that when the director wanted you to see the monsters he paid good money for, the harnesses are ditched for a proper tripod.  This combined to nullify any suspension of disbelief this movie had going for it.They should have also taken a lesson from Blair Witch in crafting a plot that made sense.  Remember the part where the kids in Blair Witch didn't have cell phones or GPS?  This made an immense amount of sense at the time as it was 1999 and these technologies were not as pervasive (or cheap) as they are today.  The Black Water filmmakers, meanwhile, live in a more modern era (one of the crew were recruited via Craigslist,)  so why are they using paper maps?  Better films have dealt with this by having cell phones that lose reception or GPS units that go haywire,  but not this flick.  Our heroes are apparently the only teens in the world that don't have cell phones and bloody Facebook.The &#34;old coot&#34; who took the blame for the murders also doesn't make a lot of sense.  First off, they keep referring to him as being an 'old pervert' at the time of the murders.  Yet when we meet him, the dude's obviously in his fifties.  If he's in his fifty at the time of the filming, he would have been in his forties or late thirties at the time of the original murders (which took place when our heroes (in their twenties) were little kids.)  Unless we're going by GAP standards, that's hardly 'old.'  I'm also not 100% as to how the authorities suspected a human being of drawing the victim's blood out through a clearly inhuman bite in the neck.  It has a bit of the Dracula VS Billy the Kid logic going for it.Without giving too much away, the monsters also didn't make a whole lot of sense.  In Blair Witch, the witch left behind piles of stones and little man-figures.  Did this make much sense?  Well, no, not really, but witches in myth/literature were mysterious figures who took part in rituals and arcane rites, so it's justifiable and atmospheric.  Why are vampires drawing inverted ankh-things with what is obviously spray paint on a tree?  Unless it's some sort of Stephanie Mayer reference, I just don't it.  It's like they were simply expecting the audience to accept the 'creepy' graffiti based on what had happened in the Blair Witch Project then on anything established within the plot itself.The monsters also don't seem to have a solid MO.  When they talk of the attacks the film makers are investigating, the vampires generally bite people on the neck, but also sometimes behead them.  Why?  Never discussed.  Maybe they're going into hairdressing and couldn't afford one of those mannequin head things.So, we have a derivative film that blows its suspension of disbelief.  Is that horrible?  Not really.  The acting, while a little cheesy and (again) derivative of better films, was actually pretty good, the build up was pretty good, and the payoff was definitely... well, I wouldn't call it GOOD, but it was definitely present.  The film managed a few pretty spooky scenes, and even though we've seen the rubber bat men a dozen times before, the director manages to pull them off without overdoing them.  For me, this makes it worthwhile as a $4.95 Saturday afternoon kind of film.",3,Did you really expect this to be Oscars-worthy?,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,4739,"['Does', 'Black', 'Water', 'Vampire',

Interviews lead to forest trekking, leading to cabin in the woods.... disapearances.... horror etc.Danielle and the other girl team-member Andrea seem to have all the brains and the guts leaving the cynical geeky soundman to be distractingly annoying right out of the gate and then the cameraman with an attitude.... well let's just say he gets what's coming; there's also an excellent supporting cast playing the townsfolk and not to mention the murderous inmate himself who really takes it to another level.  Unfortunately the dialogue devolves into typical reality show fussing and cussing fairly quickly which someday somebody's gonna figure out doesn't lend a feel of ""reality"" at all but rather emphasizes the whiny, over-privileged nature of people that apparently take on these sort of quasi-documentary projects.Amidst a sea of FF films (usually cheaply made and forgettable) BWV is a rare gem due to noticeably above-average production values including surprisingly convincing FX as well as a relatively high creepy factor (if maybe the ending felt a little 80's).  :o)",3,Why do peeps in FF horror always have the tenacity of 5 year-olds?,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,1603,"['Basically', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'vampires', 'instead', 'witches', 'vengeful', 'pagans', 'whatever', 'heck', 'were', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'quick', 'dismiss', 'just', 'creative', 'borrowing', 'okay', 'maybe', 'blatant', 'plagiarism', '.Danielle', 'Mason', 'Danielle', 'Lozeau', 'leading', 'personal', 'investigation', 'series', 'unsolved', 'murders', 'occurred', 'spooky', 'Black', 'Water', 'Forest', 'Winter', 'Solstice', 'intent', 'proving/disproving', 'guilt', 'alleged', 'murderer', 'currently', 'death-row', 'Interviews', 'lead', 'forest', 'trekking', 'leading', 'cabin', 'woods', 'disapearances', 'horror', 'etc.Danielle', 'other', 'girl', 'team-member', 'Andrea', 'seem', 'have', 'brains', 'guts', 'leaving', 'cynical', 'geeky', 'soundman', 'be', 'distractingly', 'annoying', 'right', 'gate', 'then', 'cameraman', 'attitude', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'what', 'coming', 'also', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'playing', 'townsfolk', 'not', 'mention', 'murderous', 'inmate', 'who', 'really', 'level', 'Unfortunately', 'dialogue', 'typical', 'reality', 'show', 'fussing', 'cussing', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'someday', 'somebody', 'gon', 'figure', 'out', ""n't"", 'lend', 'feel', 'reality', 'rather', 'whiny', 'over-privileged', 'nature', 'people', 'apparently', 'take', 'sort', 'quasi-documentary', 'projects.Amidst', 'sea', 'FF', 'films', 'usually', 'cheaply', 'made', 'forgettable', 'BWV', 'rare', 'gem', 'due', 'noticeably', 'above-average', 'production', 'values', 'including', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'FX', 'as', 'well', 'relatively', 'high', 'creepy', 'factor', 'maybe', 'ending', 'felt', 'little', '80', 'o']",Black Water Vampire
