1281564,A1YBRI0HWQ2HTL,B002OOWKSU,Adam Scheuer,"[0, 0]",This is kind of a quirky show about a struggling writer who decides to start doing privet detective work on the side.. All three stars of the show are showcased with an emphasis on Jason Schwartzman. Zack G is much more toned down than other things you might have seen him on but Ted Danson's character is pretty far out there and is very funny. This season took me a few episodes to get in to it but it is worth sticking out because once you get to know the characters you can really appreciate the humor.,4,"If you like the three stars, you'll enjoy this show",1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,506,"['kind', 'quirky', 'show', 'struggling', 'writer', 'who', 'start', 'doing', 'privet', 'detective', 'work', 'side..', 'All', 'three', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'showcased', 'emphasis', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Zack', 'G', 'much', 'more', 'toned', 'down', 'other', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'character', 'pretty', 'far', 'there', 'very', 'funny', 'season', 'took', 'few', 'episodes', 'get', 'worth', 'sticking', 'out', 'once', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'humor']",N/A

In fact, it's not one of its finer points. The same is true for lead actor Jason Schwartzman as well. He's not a great actor and is just terrible without the right direction. In BTD, he holds a Woody Allen-like charm that makes it work, awkwardly talking about feelings where no one would. Luckily, we have episode three in season one to show us what BTD is capable of, and it's wonderful. Furthermore, season two drifts a bit off the detective premise and decreased the tension/danger while upping the fun. Yes, Ted Danson's character is just superb, so much so that the show loses steam when he's not around. Zach Galifianakis' character is his usual absurd man-child, but he expands the persona and makes it somewhat believable. The revolving cast of supporting actors is so excellent that it's sad that many of them are only in one episode.

It's consistently hilarious, chaotic and engaging. Ted Danson, Jason Schwartzman and Zach Galifianakis play three close friends who, amid their individual strange lives, often join together to solve some major dilemna in their lives. There is ample language, drug themes, and sexual themes to keep this series in the adult category... definitely inappropriate for children. The three main characters are lovable and funny. Danson is my favorite as the pot-smoking patriarch of the group. Schwartzman is superb as the slightly inept author/private detective. And Galifianakis is outrageous as the nuerotic comic book artist. This series has all the ingredients needed to sustain its appeal for a long time to come.

Fortunately, Jonathan Ames' HBO comedy series dodges the bullet -- its mix of comedy, mystery and Ames' own personal experiences is hilarious, the writing is excellent, and Jason Schwartzman heads a brilliant little cast that manages to charm you as they make you laugh.Writer Jonathan Ames (Schwartzman) is depressed when his girlfriend moves out. So after seeing a Raymond Chandler novel, he goes onto Craigslist and advertises himself as a private eye: ""I'm not licensed, but maybe I'm someone who can help you.""Surprisingly, there are some takers. Ames ends up taking on several small-time cases, mostly centering around people/things that are lost or stolen -- a sister who vanished, a boyfriend who may be cheating, a script he accidentally lost himself, a stolen skateboard, a Russian convict who wants to find his true love, a blackmail tape, and lesbian con-artists who are... well, stealing something rather personal.And while he does all this, Jonathan is dealing with the problems of his own life, such as his lingering love for his girlfriend and his stalled second novel. His friend Ray (Zak Galifianakis) is struggling with his controlling girlfriend Leah and his graphic novel career. And Jonathan has to babysit his insane boss George (Ted Danson), the owner of the magazine he writes for, who has his own set of weird personal problems (and frankly he doesn't seem to live in the same world as the rest of us).""Bored to Death"" is one of those comedy shows that doesn't really resemble anything else on TV -- it has a distinctly arty, New York flavor, but avoids seeming pretentious just because its lead characters are so earnest. And while there are plenty of hilarious situations (George and Ray attacking a blackmailer... armed with toys), it manages to never quite cross the line into total absurdity.And the writing is really, really clever. Without resting too long on any one joke, the writers dabble in humor from colonics, therapists, sperm donation, vegans, pot, the Russian mafia and plenty of subtle literary references. It has plenty of hilarious lines (""I've always been intrigued by Stockholm Syndrome. Makes me think of my childhood"") and funny dialogue, particularly between George and ANYBODY (""How long has Jonathan been in there?"" ""I don't know. I'm on marijuana minutes""). But the writers also include some powerful character-building moments, such as George's lingering love for his ex-wife (and what he does because she asks him).Schwartzman is charming as a rather dweeby writer who is desperately seeking some kind of happiness in his life, but isn't entirely sure how to find it -- so he tries to help other people. Galifianakis is plenty of fun as his big hairy pal in dissatisfied maleness, and there are some great smaller turns by Bebe Neuwirth (as Ames' editor), Parker Posey and Oliver Platt. And of course, Ted Danson is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT as Ames' world-weary, mildly insane boss.If you like a clever, quirky little comedy without a laugh track, ""Bored To Death"" definitely won't live up to its name -- it's weird, funny and somehow endearing.

Schwartzman is kind of a parody of himself as usual but I'm enjoying it.  The situation humor is kind of understated, funny in a half tongue-in-cheek easy-going way and there are lots of throwaway bits of rather deep observations on life (and death), love and sex.. and, um, ganga.  I like the show.  Won't say it's the funniest thing I've ever seen, but amusing or entertaining aptly describes.  Glad to see Ted up there again and he's still got it.  Was great to see him in Damages as well. Bored to Death obviously isn't the heavyweight show that that one was, but it's great to see him again in the next best Danson comedy to Cheers.  Speaking of stars, this one gets a fair few famous guests (Jim Jarmusch has a part in one episode as does Kevin Bacon and some others I recognized)..  For a really funny and well-written detective series it's hard to beat ""Monk"", but if you don't come expecting too much, and enjoy a ""dramedy"" or a ""mysteramedy"" of types, you'll probably enjoy ""Bored To Death"".

A Bowen ""tabithajab""","[46, 52]","Jonathan Ames (Jason Schwartzman) is a freelance writer with one novel under his belt, a 447,000 rating on Amazon, and serious writers' block.  He writes the occasional article for his friend George Christopher (Ted Danson, in a hilarious role), the bored-to-death editor of an Esquire-type magazine.  Meanwhile, his buddy Ray (Zak Galifianakis)is a frustrated graphic novelist, comic-strip artist trying to hawk his work, with meager results.  Zak's girlfriend Leah controls his every move, while Jonathan's girlfriend Suzanne moves out after Jonathan refuses to clean up his act according to her straight-edge wishes, i.e., no drinking, no pot smoking.After losing his roommate/lover, Jonathan is unable to write, and suffers from a serious case of the doldrums. He mopes around his apartment, doing very little but reading Raymond Chandler novels and getting smoked up.  Schwartzman is very good at conveying this bright-guy-turning-into-a-loser character.  Apparently inspired by the Chandler novels, he decides to try his hand at being a private eye himself.  Despite having no background whatsoever in police work, he figures he has nothing to lose and advertises on craigslist as an ""unlicensed"" private detective.  He hopes that by doing this he will pad his bank account, as well as find inspiration for his writing.  Thus, the hilarity ensues.The series is stylish, with lots of allusions to Raymond Chandler potboilers, complete with gorgeous, troubled dames, topcoats, hats, and all the Chandler-esque parafernalia.  Jonathan hasn't a clue as to what he's doing, but somehow his escapades all work out, with George and Ray as his Keystone cops sidekicks.  Each episode is done tongue-in-cheek, requiring a large dose of literary license from the viewer.  If the viewer has a sense of fun and enjoys a well-crafted farce, this isn't hard to do.  I hope this series catches on, because in my household, this is half an hour of very entertaining television.  All the actors do a fine job, my favorite being Ted Danson, who seems to thoroughly enjoy acting a fool and probably getting paid enormous amounts of money to do so.  Some of the scenes are sidesplittingly funny; others have a Woody Allen-ish charm, as Schwartzman is exactly the kind of appealing nebbish that Allen always played.

Tasker,"[3, 3]","Wildly uneven but ultimately quite enjoyable show about a writer whose boozing and smoking cost him his girl and award him a stellar scheme as a private eye. Bored to Death begins with this premise, and spot-on performances by its three leads. The jokes are witty and shrewd, relatively timely with jabs at sperm donation, the modern publishing industry, 'volcano' vaporizers, etc. Early on, cameos from people like Jim Jarmusch add a certain element of hipster street cred, as do references to about a bazillion writers. If there were an award for name-dropping dead white scribes, Bored to Death would take the cake hands-down. Not that this is necessarily bad. For a show about writing, it is assumed that the past informs the present and Jason Schwartzman's Jonathan (as well as his creator, also named Jonathan) has definitely done a great deal of reading. Somewhere around the halfway point, however, the season begins to lag. While earlier episodes clock in at around 30 minutes, a thoroughly lackluster episode entitled 'The Case of the Missing Skateboard' ends at a mere 20 minutes. Very disappointing, given the show's opening promise. These 20 minutes are packed full of Parker Posey looking old and out-of-touch in severely baggy jeans, forming a never-quite-explained or properly-ironed-out relationship with Jonathan and ending with a silly chase scene. Overall, a low-stakes episode that sets the pace for at least the next two episodes. The final two episodes, at last, return to the great wit and malice of the first two, making one wonder whether or not the first season would have been better as a two hour movie, instead of 8 episodes. All things considered, the show is well worth your $20, if only to see Ted Danson as a pot-smoking erudite maniac.",3,"Clever, snarky and uneven",1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,1770,"['Wildly', 'uneven', 'ultimately', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'show', 'writer', 'boozing', 'smoking', 'cost', 'girl', 'award', 'stellar', 'scheme', 'private', 'eye', 'Bored', 'Death', 'premise', 'spot-on', 'performances', 'three', 'leads', 'jokes', 'are', 'witty', 'shrewd', 'relatively', 'timely', 'jabs', 'sperm', 'donation', 'modern', 'publishing', 'industry', 'vaporizers', 'etc', 'Early', 'cameos', 'people', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'add', 'certain', 'element', 'hipster', 'street', 'cred', 'do', 'references', 'bazillion', 'writers', 'were', 'award', 'name-dropping', 'dead', 'white', 'scribes', 'Bored', 'Death', 'would', 'take', 'cake', 'hands-down', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'show', 'writing', 'assumed', 'past', 'informs', 'present', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Jonathan', 'as', 'well', 'creator', 'also', 'named', 'Jonathan', 'definitely', 'done', 'great', 'deal', 'reading', 'Somewhere', 'halfway', 'point', 'however', 'season', 'lag', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'clock', '30', 'minutes', 'thoroughly', 'lackluster', 'episode', 'entitled', ""'The"", 'Case', 'Missing', 'Skateboard', 'ends', 'mere', '20', 'minutes', 'Very', 'disappointing', 'given', 'show', 'opening', 'promise', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'packed', 'full', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'looking', 'old', 'out-of-touch', 'severely', 'baggy', 'jeans', 'forming', 'never-quite-explained', 'properly-ironed-out', 'relationship', 'Jonathan', 'ending', 'silly', 'chase', 'scene', 'Overall', 'low-stakes', 'episode', 'pace', 'least', 'next', 'two', 'episodes', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'last', 'return', 'great', 'wit', 'malice', 'first', 'two', 'making', 'one', 'wonder', 'not', 'first', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'instead', '8', 'episodes', 'things', 'considered', 'show', 'well', 'worth', '20', 'only', 'see', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'pot-smoking', 'erudite', 'maniac']",N/A

It just never really hits its stride. The characters aren't that likeable and the series often feels kind of derivative with nothing compelling about it. Also, there isn't much in the way of dynamics, except when Ted Danson's character appears. However, on the whole it's somewhat more positive than negative.

1281606,A3I8FT707XKQAJ,B002OOWKSU,Sam Quixote,"[1, 1]","""Bored to Death"" is about the travails of the novelist Jonathan Ames (Jason Schwartzman) as he struggles to complete his second novel, get over the breakup of his girlfriend, and explore the new world of being a (unlicensed) private detective in New York city. Helping him on the way is his cartoonist friend Ray (Zach Galifianakis) and magazine magnate George (Ted Danson).""Bored to Death"" is a gentle comedy/mild drama and it's episodes are quite subtle and laid back. The stories are always interesting and tend to revolve around people approaching Jonathan to find things for them, people, skateboards, in one case, sperm.Jason Schwartzman plays the kind of character you've seen him play before in a number of films particularly Wes Anderson's. The laid back, articulate, gentle and kind person is a character he can play very well and is pleasant to watch.Zach G's (I can't type his overcomplicated surname again) character is slightly different from others he's played, he's not overly camp and annoying nor is he psychotic or incredibly insensitive and overbearing - he's actually more normal than Jason's character and surprisingly likeable too.Ted Danson is brilliant as the rich, perpetually drunk/stoned magazine publisher who's energetic and freewheeling as he journeys with Jonathan through the episodes. He also looks damn good for his age, it's like the man doesn't age, his hair just changes colour!I really enjoyed this short but interesting 8 episode series. It tells some funny, interesting stories and introduces us to likeable characters. New York is also shot really well - the episodes take you to Brighton Beach to Brooklyn to Manhattan to the Bronx and shows you the richness and variety that is part of New York's charm.Quite a few of the jokes revolve around the characters' frequent consumption of weed and booze so if that's not your bag then you probably won't be crazy about the humour. It's not as manic as ""30 Rock"" nor as zeitgeisty as ""The Office"" but it's humour is slower and more deliberate.""Bored to Death"" is a charming and witty series that I liked watching the hell out of - roll on Season 2!",5,Not bored at all,1308873600,"06 24, 2011",2011,2135,"['Bored', 'Death', 'travails', 'novelist', 'Jonathan', 'Ames', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'complete', 'second', 'novel', 'get', 'breakup', 'girlfriend', 'explore', 'new', 'world', 'being', 'unlicensed', 'private', 'detective', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'Helping', 'way', 'cartoonist', 'friend', 'Ray', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'magazine', 'magnate', 'George', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Bored', 'Death', 'gentle', 'comedy/mild', 'drama', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'subtle', 'laid', 'back', 'stories', 'are', 'always', 'interesting', 'tend', 'revolve', 'people', 'approaching', 'Jonathan', 'find', 'things', 'people', 'skateboards', 'one', 'case', 'sperm.Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'kind', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'number', 'films', 'particularly', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'laid', 'back', 'articulate', 'gentle', 'kind', 'person', 'character', 'can', 'play', 'very', 'well', 'pleasant', 'watch.Zach', 'G', 'ca', ""n't"", 'type', 'overcomplicated', 'surname', 'again', 'character', 'slightly', 'different', 'others', 'played', 'not', 'overly', 'camp', 'annoying', 'psychotic', 'incredibly', 'insensitive', 'overbearing', 'actually', 'more', 'normal', 'Jason', 'character', 'surprisingly', 'likeable', 'too.Ted', 'Danson', 'brilliant', 'rich', 'perpetually', 'drunk/stoned', 'magazine', 'publisher', 'who', 'energetic', 'freewheeling', 'Jonathan', 'episodes', 'also', 'damn', 'good', 'age', 'man', ""n't"", 'age', 'hair', 'just', 'changes', 'colour', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'short', 'interesting', '8', 'episode', 'series', 'funny', 'interesting', 'stories', 'introduces', 'likeable', 'characters', 'New', 'York', 'also', 'shot', 'really', 'well', 'episodes', 'take', 'Brighton', 'Beach', 'Brooklyn', 'Manhattan', 'Bronx', 'richness', 'variety', 'part', 'New', 'York', 'charm.Quite', 'few', 'jokes', 'revolve', 'characters', 'frequent', 'consumption', 'weed', 'booze', 'so', 'not', 'bag', 'then', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'crazy', 'humour', 'not', 'as', 'manic', '30', 'Rock', 'as', 'zeitgeisty', 'Office', 'humour', 'slower', 'more', 'deliberate', 'Bored', 'Death', 'charming', 'witty', 'series', 'liked', 'watching', 'hell', 'roll', 'Season', '2']",N/A
