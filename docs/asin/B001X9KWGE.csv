He has an abusive father that has affected him badly, but his friendship with Roy, who among other things, is the school bus driver, develops into a beautiful, touching love affair. The end of this film in extremely confusing, and unbelievably stupid. This was a great love story with one of the most pathetic endings I have ever seen.

And in the process or readjusting to this new environment he finds out there is one boy he can trust: Roy.Is Nathan just a harmless and defenseless kid that seeks out protection? Or is he a very troubled boy, haunted by traumatic events that he never dares to share? Two elements are made obvious in the movie. One: the devastating effects of father on son incest. Two: the even more catastrophic consequences of excessive passivity. Nathan, just like his mother, is of a very submissive nature.Some of the most classic psychoanalytic theories associate submissive-passive behavior with the figure of the abject. Abject is understood as the vilest and lowest position conceivable. It is of course imputed to male on male homosexual intercourse. What remains of interest about this theory, though, is that the abject works in terms of passivity. The male who allows himself to be penetrated is then the vilest and lowest; penetration is understood as the worst of the worst. But even these theories, in all their mighty psychological mumble jumble, seem to confuse the active position with the heterosexual identity. As a result, the straight guy who happens to ""top"" a gay guy can still brag about it, something he could never even disclose publicly if he had chosen to be the one in the passive position. This, of course, goes to all lengths, it can create hierarchies (for example, who penetrates who in jail), it can serve as an excuse for gay intercourse while maintaining a heterosexual faade, etc.Throughout the film problems are avoided as long as Roy remains in his active position. Roy is the leader of a group of boys and he messes around with a girl, up until this point he could still claim he is straight despite his sexual encounters with Nathan. But when he assumes a more passive position regarding Nathan everything crumbles to pieces and tragedy ensues. When his friends catch him off guard practicing oral sex to Nathan he loses all power and authority. And because of that, his friends are now enabled to partake in abuses they might have not considered before. Consequently, one of Roy's friends will feel encouraged to rape Nathan and then to attack him violently and brutally.There is also an important approach to Jacques Lacan's concept of symbolic death. There is an in-between place. There is an impasse between symbolic death and actual (real) death. Perhaps James Bolton correlates passivity with death. Or perhaps the film simply imbricates the repercussions of real death versus the significance and emotional strength involved in symbolic death.""Dream Boy"" has a very sad and touching end. It does give conclusion to the premises established since the opening shots. And moreover, it makes the viewer realize how deeply human and fragile the protagonists are. Bolton's bold narrative surpasses the novel's qualities and delivers a stunningly beautiful film.",5,Can active and passive roles define sexual identity?,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,3020,"['Rural', 'dynamics', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'especially', 'who', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'adapting', 'what', 'newcomer', 'Nathan', 'process', 'readjusting', 'new', 'environment', 'out', 'one', 'boy', 'can', 'trust', 'Roy.Is', 'Nathan', 'just', 'harmless', 'defenseless', 'kid', 'out', 'protection', 'very', 'troubled', 'boy', 'haunted', 'traumatic', 'events', 'never', 'share', 'Two', 'elements', 'are', 'made', 'obvious', 'movie', 'One', 'devastating', 'effects', 'father', 'son', 'incest', 'Two', 'even', 'more', 'catastrophic', 'consequences', 'excessive', 'passivity', 'Nathan', 'just', 'mother', 'very', 'submissive', 'nature.Some', 'most', 'classic', 'psychoanalytic', 'theories', 'associate', 'submissive-passive', 'behavior', 'figure', 'abject', 'Abject', 'understood', 'vilest', 'lowest', 'position', 'conceivable', 'course', 'imputed', 'male', 'male', 'homosexual', 'intercourse', 'What', 'interest', 'theory', 'though', 'abject', 'terms', 'passivity', 'male', 'who', 'be', 'penetrated', 'then', 'vilest', 'lowest', 'penetration', 'understood', 'worst', 'worst', 'even', 'theories', 'mighty', 'psychological', 'mumble', 'jumble', 'seem', 'confuse', 'active', 'position', 'heterosexual', 'identity', 'result', 'straight', 'guy', 'who', 'top', 'gay', 'guy', 'can', 'still', 'brag', 'something', 'could', 'never', 'even', 'disclose', 'publicly', 'had', 'chosen', 'be', 'one', 'passive', 'position', 'course', 'lengths', 'can', 'create', 'hierarchies', 'example', 'who', 'who', 'jail', 'can', 'serve', 'excuse', 'gay', 'intercourse', 'maintaining', 'heterosexual', 'faade', 'film', 'problems', 'are', 'avoided', 'as', 'long', 'Roy', 'active', 'position', 'Roy', 'leader', 'group', 'boys', 'girl', 'up', 'point', 'could', 'still', 'claim', 'straight', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'Nathan', 'when', 'more', 'passive', 'position', 'regarding', 'Nathan', 'everything', 'crumbles', 'pieces', 'tragedy', 'ensues', 'When', 'friends', 'catch', 'off', 'guard', 'practicing', 'oral', 'sex', 'Nathan', 'power', 'authority', 'friends', 'are', 'now', 'enabled', 'partake', 'abuses', 'might', 'have', 'not', 'considered', 'Consequently', 'one', 'Roy', 'friends', 'will', 'feel', 'encouraged', 'rape', 'Nathan', 'then', 'attack', 'violently', 'brutally.There', 'also', 'important', 'approach', 'Jacques', 'Lacan', 'concept', 'symbolic', 'death', 'in-between', 'place', 'impasse', 'symbolic', 'death', 'actual', 'real', 'death', 'Perhaps', 'James', 'Bolton', 'passivity', 'death', 'perhaps', 'film', 'simply', 'repercussions', 'real', 'death', 'significance', 'emotional', 'strength', 'involved', 'symbolic', 'death', 'Dream', 'Boy', 'very', 'sad', 'touching', 'end', 'give', 'conclusion', 'premises', 'established', 'opening', 'shots', 'moreover', 'viewer', 'realize', 'how', 'deeply', 'human', 'fragile', 'protagonists', 'are', 'Bolton', 'bold', 'narrative', 'novel', 'qualities', 'delivers', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'film']",N/A

Used to being alone, Nathan relishes the attention of Roy, a popular boy who drives the local school bus, and asks for Nathan's help with an English paper.  They become clandestine lovers, and go with two other boys on a camping trip, where they tell ghost stories, and ultimately take steps that will forever change their lives.Based on the landmark 1995 novel by Jim Grimsley, ""Dream Boy"" (2008) is faithful to that source material, and is essentially a love story with paranormal aspects to it. Many people will love it, others will have problems with it, for the same reasons as many objected to the strange turn the original story took at the end. (Can't get much more in detail without giving away spoilers!)Since the book was originally adapted as a play a decade ago, people have been waiting for this film, which has been a long time in production, probably because of its unique storyline.  It has been playing the gay film festival circuit for 2 years, with reviews hot and cold, as has been audience reaction. The lead actors, Stephan Bender (Nathan) and Max Roeng (Roy) do a commendable job with emotionally-challenging roles and somewhat inane dialogue, though Bender acts more comatose than shy and withdrawn at times. Rated a solid ""R"" for simulated sex and content that includes gay rape.  ...  DVD has no extras other than chapter stops.  Those who loved the book will want to give it five stars, those who didn't read the book will probably give this three stars.  I'll compromise at four stars out of five.

1244969,A1A3ZFTFW2SY1M,B001X9KWGE,chromo_man,"[0, 0]","The problem with &#8220;Dream Boy&#8221; is that it doesn&#8217;t know what it wants to be, the romantic coming of age story that progresses through the first two thirds of the journey, or the murky, ambiguous gothic denouement which seems tacked on here, where its real ending ought to be.  And it is just that disjointedness which sinks this otherwise promising endeavor.  The film seems to have so much going for it.  The leads are well-cast, the rural small town setting is appropriately atmospheric, and the soundtrack music adds just the right notes.  The story seems on track, if a bit unoriginal.  But then it all goes awry.  Even if its audience were to be open to some sort of eerie paranormal twist, it would be right to expect a more intelligible ending.  Forget about being &#8220;open to interpretation:&#8221;  not only do the last scenes not fit with the earlier parts of the film, but they make no sense.

It sounded good and I discounted the negative reviews as being maybe biased or ""you can't please everyone"". BUT as I viewed this film, I was mesmerized right up to the last ten minutes or so, and then dropped flat on my face in disgust. This could have been one of the all time greats in gay cinema, but the ending however was the worse I could have imagined. Unlike many reviewers here, I did not read the book from which this film was based. And after watching the DVD, I never WANT to read the book.I was enthrolled with the leading character Nathan (Stephan Bender) a part which was so very well cast and his acting was incredible. He nailed it to a tee all the way through. The rest of the acting was good, some parts better than others. The whole film seemed well done and was an enjoyable film to watch as you felt there was a very good point building up for the ending. Parts of the film were a bit hard to follow as the relationship between the lead characters was building over time, but once it took off, it went great! It was a pleasure to watch and kept my interest until the whole thing made a southbound turn into a horror film. The ending is not for the viewer who wants to see a great love story between two young men. If you liked the ending, then so be it, NEVERTHELESS you should surely agree that others need to be warned that this is not your average run of the mill love story and the ending can be quite devastating to the viewer if they are not prepared for it. That is the purpose of my review. I would have given this film a SOLID five stars were it not for the storyline ending in such an incredibly disappointing way. Watch it if you will, BUT BE PREPARED for the ending. You are NOT going to like it. What is billed as a coming of age film, about gay romance is nothing more than a horror film. ""Dream Boy"" was a very inappropriate title for this film. My five star rating fell to three over the ending alone, and quite frankly should have been no higher than a two. The actors however done an excellent job portraying their characters. There simply wasn't much they could do with a poorly written story. Not my idea of entertainment when the ending is horribly WRONG that it makes me want to punch the writer. Had it been based on a true story, and publicized as so, then it would hold some merit, but this thing was written from the dark mind of a very sick individual who doesn't much care for Love. Kind of like the father of ""Nathan"" who seemed quite pleased that his son would never be able to tell anyone what he had done.",3,Don't be duped!

1244971,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001X9KWGE,Grady Harp,"[8, 9]","Back in 1995 Jim Grimsley published DREAM BOY, the second novel of his continuing examination of the coming of age in the South and followed by the equally popular COMFORT AND JOY, BOULEVARD, FORGIVENESS, MY DROWNING  etc.  It took many years of for James Bolton ('Eban & Charley', 'The Graffiti Artist') to decide to adapt this story to the screen, and while Bolton elected to replace much of the lyricism of Grimsley's prose  with extended periods of non-verbal communication in the screenplay, the story of two high school kids coming to grips with a mutual attraction in the dank repressive aura of the South manages to still come through intact.Nathan (Stephen Bender) is a quiet, reclusive sophomore in high school who is settling in to yet another move by his alcoholic, Bible-pounding, abusive father (Thomas Jay Ryan) and his sympathetic mother (Diana Scarwid). Next door lives handsome jock Roy (Maximillian Roeg) who befriends Nathan, shares homework, and when he is not with his girlfriend, offers Nathan rides in the school bus he drives.  Exchanges of glances and the growth of mutual attraction between the boys lead to a very private but sincere physical relationship: Nathan does not share with Roy that he has suffered sexual abuse from his father. Roy and his buddies - Burke (a very promising Randy Wayne) and Randy (Owen Beckman) - begin to join the boys on swimming gigs and finally a camping trip that includes visitation of an old deserted and possibly haunted plantation house.  What happens in this mysterious place provides the climax of the story - a brutal surprise ending that then transports the film into another dimension - a region the viewer must decide is satisfying or not.There are some fine moments in this little low budget movie and the presence of Maximillian Roeg, Diana Scarwid, and Randy Wayne lifts the cast to a higher level of competence.  Whether or not the viewer is willing to go along with the ending will make the vote for or against the film.  Bolton does have a fine touch with stories about the coming out of young men in his films and his ability to capture the Gothic atmosphere of the South is solid.

1244972,A1X1RWRPSAL206,B001X9KWGE,"interested_observer ""interested_observer""","[19, 20]","""Dream Boy"" is a film based closely on Jim Grimsley's 1995 book of the same name.Passive high school sophomore Nathan (Stephan Bender) moves again with his protective mother Vivian (Diana Scarwid) and unstable father Harland (Thomas Jay Ryan), this time to the town of St. Francisville, Louisiana.  Neighbor Roy (Maximillian Roeg), a regular guy high school senior, gets to drive their school bus to and from school, allowing the new neighbors to get a good look at each other.After cutting a deal in which Roy trades his math tutoring skills for Nathan's skills at tutoring English, they swiftly discover they have much more to offer each other.Out at the local swimming hole, Roy introduces Nathan to two buddies, assertive Burke (Randy Wayne) and easy-going Randy (Owen Beckman), who have been observing Roy getting closer over time to Nathan.  Burke, who might have an unspoken interest in Roy himself, tests the waters by seeming to try to throw non-swimmer Nathan into the water.  Roy rises to the challenge, and Burke backs off.After some harrowing trouble at home, the abject Nathan joins Roy, Burke, and Randy on an multi-day camping trip through marshy Louisiana.  Roy tells some scary stories.  They pair up in tents.  All seems to be going well.Then the foursome come across the abandoned Kennicott plantation house.  Is it haunted?  Let's find out.  Nathan seems to sense some things.  The story then veers through heedlessness and violence to a supernatural but partly-happy ending where the relationship of Roy and dreamy, live-in-his-head Nathan is transformed.  Different people will feel differently about the resolution, which is slightly different from the book's.The story, acting, locations, and sets are generally good.  Bender and Roeg both do well as the leads.  The setting appears to be in the 1970's or 1980's, as there is no electronic gear around anywhere.  One is reminded how lush and devoid of people the muddy Louisiana countryside can be.  The ambient homophobia is nowhere explicitly expressed but is universally assumed.  There are skin scenes for Roy, Nathan, and Burke, all of whom are lookers.  There are several sex scenes, not all pretty.The only extras are trailers to three other movies.

The school bus is driven by the enigmatic Roy, who, most likely due to the town's limited resources, has the responsibility of ferrying the town's children to and from the local school. One day, a new student, the quiet and reserved Nathan moves into town with his parents. Since he lives across from Roy, he is his first passenger.Both sets of parents are god fearing, church going christians and attend the same church with their sons.Nathan's father is an abusive drunk and his mother is distant and submissive, leaving Nathan with little support. Roy is keenly observant of this, and becomes a friend and protector. As the friendship grows, there begins a romantic aspect to it, with Roy falling hard for shy Nathan.Roy's friends grudgingly accept the new boy and make him a part of their group. As the relationship grows between Roy and Nathan, one of the others begins to suspect that Nathan is gay.Roy and Nathan dream of one day leaving the miserable small town and heading out into the world together as partners. What Roy wants most of all to get him away from his abusive and neglectful family. The school bus represents the fact that Roy takes responsibility for not just Nathan's safety, but that of all the children. This gives the viewer  insight into Roy's character and that he is a caring and loving young man.One day, during a visit to an abandoned house, Nathan is confronted and tricked by the homophobe and is beaten as they are leaving. Roy is unaware of what has happened, and his friend tells him that he shouldn't worry, that he probably got lost. The truth is much more brutal and devastating.There are a few changes between the screenplay and the book, but the final sequence is very different. Although both tell approximately the same thing, I believe that the book's ending is better. Either way, the truth is devastatingly cruel and is left somewhat to interpretation. That said, it still says the same thing.Beautifully photographed and with first rate production values, fine acting and sensitive direction, this film deserves a chance. Although tragic and quite realistic in its story of two boys who find a deep and wonderful love, although cut short by prejudice, it is a wonderful tale that needs a wider audience.

Nathan is shy withdrawn and prone to acne, which even quality foundation wont really help with. This time they have landed up in St Francisville, situated just right of the arse end of nowhere.Then he discovers that the boy next door, Roy (Maximillian Roeg), drives the school bus (which I found to be a bit of a stretch as he is a student at the school and a year above Nathan). The town is full of clap board houses, clap, clap Bible groups and clapped out cars. It is the sort of place that attracts dust. Nathan has the surf boy long hair and a languid approach to members of the opposite sex, which heighten the whole ambiguity of the film. He also has a couple of friends whose over  eager `jockness' juxtapose brilliantly with Nathan's withdrawn effeminacy.It turns out Nathan is good at English and Roy isn't, so they decide to do some after school study, which inevitably leads to some serious extra curricular activities. This would be all well and good, but something about Nathans father seems to indicate, that he too is up for a bit of homespun schooling.This then is Brokeback Mountain, without the mountain or the interludes in `togetherness', it is beautifully filmed and the musical score is both dramatic and effective, the acting is also above passable. There is one comic clich&eacute; moment when one of the lads (Randy) says `Gee it is so hot out here', where have I heard that one before. Anyway it has enough twists and turns to keep your interest up, it is not a full on voyeur fest, but it does have its semi (oops) moments. And there are moments of real tension that make the viewing quite uncomfortable. The screen play and direction come from James Bolton who must be praised for making an emotional, emotive and challenging piece.
