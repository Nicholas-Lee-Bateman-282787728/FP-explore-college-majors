1576738,AICC1R30KLRU8,B008VPBZXW,Anthony Trimarchi,"[1, 1]","&#34;A Christmas Story 2&#34; (2012). I am familiar with Jean Shepherd&#8217;s work which includes vintage radio programs, and later made for TV (American Playhouse on PBS) movie specials center around &#8220;Ralph Parker&#8221;. In retrospect a semi-factual flashback into Jean&#8217;s own childhood while growing up in Indiana during the 1930s. &#8220;A Christmas Story&#8221; (1983) is not the first in the &#34;Ralph&#34; series, as there were a few other television movies where Jean narrates a &#34;Ralph&#34; growing-up flashback similar to this movie. The leg lamp award plot was first featured in &#8220;Phantom Of The Open Hearth&#8221; which aired on TV in 1976. &#34;Phantom Of The Open Hearth&#34; is similar to &#8220;A Christmas Story&#8221;, but the plot is set during Ralph&#8217; junior high prom instead of Ralph being a nine year old during Christmas time. So, these &#8220;Ralph&#8221; growing up tales have several films behind them, all with different cast and plots.  Films such as &#8220;The Star Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski&#8221; from 1985 which features Ralph falling in love with his new neighbor's Polish daughter, and &#8220;The Great American Fourth of July&#8221; from 1982. &#8220;A Christmas Story&#8221; was theater released in 1983, and is not the first or original in this series, and the cast in that film was not in the previous installments or later installments. So, we have &#8220;A Christmas Story 2&#8221; (2012), which is an official direct sequel to &#8220;A Christmas Story&#8221; (1983). It features a new cast, considering the film is made twenty-nine years after the original film, that is no surprise. While the earlier &#8220;Ralph&#8221; films focused on Ralph as a teenager usually in high school around spring/summer or Thanksgiving, &#8220;A Christmas Story&#8221; took the character and placed him at nine years old around Christmas season. In &#8220;A Christmas Story 2&#8221; Ralph is a teenager as in the original stories. In many aspects, this sequel is true to the original PBS 1970s/80s made for TV films of this series.You have to go into this film knowing that Ralph&#8217; is now a teenager, and the film&#8217;s plot is not around a nine year old wanting a BB Gun for Christmas nor the main character acting like a nine year old. This film is not trying to recreate the original, but expand on it as a sequel set several years later when kids of that age/era became interested in girls and cars instead of BB Guns and toys, yet at times still make mistakes like they did when they were kids.  I'll admit, having seen the original &#34;A Christmas Story&#34; back in the 1980s, I was never a huge fan of it. I always thought that film was a little silly, and at times over-eccentric. Yet, it was still a good movie, that became more popular in the 1990s when it started to air repetitively on television (after &#8220;It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life&#8221; started airing less and less due to TV licensing issues). &#34;A Christmas Story&#34; was not as well popular in the early 1980s as it is today. That is not into it became the new &#8220;It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life&#8221; because of the Thanksgiving or Christmas TV marathon runnings that started during the late 1990s which allowed more people to catch on to this film, making it a modern cult classic. Most likely there was never an official sequel to the original because the original, similar to films like &#8220;Eddie and the Cruisers&#8221;, didn&#8217;t become popular into months or years later after its original release, and into it started airing on regular TV. By the end of the 1990s &#8220;A Christmas Story&#8221; became a modern classic. With that said, a sequel was made in 2012.&#34;A Christmas Story 2&#34; is set five years after the original film, and Ralph is a teenager. I won&#8217;t spoil the plot, but it&#8217;s fairly good. The re-capturing of post-war 1946 Indiana is A+. The only mistake is when the film portrays the president as Roosevelt when Roosevelt had died in 1945. The town, scenes, cars, nostalgia is that of a true 1940s period. For a direct-to-DVD release the set and costumes were perfect, and I applaud the film makers for that. Now, as for the story, I like it. It picks up on a little of the previous &#8220;Ralph&#8221; films that I mentioned earlier, and reminisces without copying some of the first film. I thought the acting was fine. Daniel Stern played the &#8220;old man&#8221; as good as one can play it. The other cast members were just as good, if not better (in my opinion) than the original cast. With the story line being entertaining, the casting superb, and the filming scene lots, costumes, props, and 1946 era Indiana being right to target; I see almost nothing negative to review about this film. So, the question is, why do so many people hate this film?It&#8217;s simple. They&#8217;re expecting it to be like the original or have the same plot/actors/mentality of the original. Which it does not. This film, if it had the character names changed, and given a new title, could stand on its own. You have to go into this film expecting a whole new and different film. Don&#8217;t sit there and try to compare this scene to the original film&#8217;s scenes, or this actor to the original film&#8217;s actor, or this plot to the original&#8217;s plot. Just watch the film for what it is, ignore the first film, and enjoy it. You&#8217;ll find this film warming, fun, eye candy for those that like 1940s nostalgia especially 1940s cars, and a fun plot that doesn&#8217;t &#8220;over do it&#8221;. Keep in mind, Ralph is a teenager now, so you&#8217;re not going to see this film through the eyes of a nine year old, but now an almost fifteen year old. Even his &#8220;daydreams&#8221; are typical teenager daydreams (dating the perfect girl, and having the perfect car.) The sub-plot of liking the prettiest girl in his school, and dreaming about dating her, was originally found in Jean Shepherds &#8220;Phantom Of The Open Hearth&#8221; .I&#8217;m almost thirty-four years old, I remember the original from the 1980s when it was popular after being released onto VHS/Betamax, and I&#8217;ve seen the original countless times over the years. Yes, this film is not equal or a copy to the original&#8230;because it&#8217;s not meant to be. It&#8217;s meant to stand as a story of its own, and take on a new plot of its own. I found this movie enjoyable, fun, and at times better than the original. If you go into this movie not trying to compare it to the original or expecting the same antics/cast of the original, or look at is as an entirely new movie not related/copy to the original, you won&#8217;t be disappointed. A reviewer mentioned about &#8220;the old man&#8217;s&#8221; constant use of a swearing word. This is a semi-factual account from Jean&#8217;s own life of his father, and in all the &#8220;Ralph&#8221; films I&#8217;ve mentioned above, where the father in that film uses that word often. If anything, I can say &#8220;A Christmas Story 2&#8221; picks up more on the PBS films of the 1970s/80s than it does the 1983 &#8220;A Christmas Story&#8221; version of Ralph.I give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars. I drop a half a star because of two film errors that could of easily been noticed by the producers with a little research of 1946 history. The Roosevelt being president in 1946 scene mistake; when in fact Roosevelt had died in 1945. That is one of those &#34;no excuse&#34; historical errors. Plus, most Americans were unaware Roosevelt was in a wheelchair as he kept that hidden from public display/photographs. And the town&#8217;s movie theater had only &#8220;It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life&#8221; listed as its main (and only) playing film. When in fact &#8220;The Best Years of our Lives&#8221; with Myrna Loy and Fredric March would have been the top billing title film, as that film had been released in November of 1946, and was by December 1946 already Academy Award bound for Best Picture. &#8220;It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life&#8221; was semi-released on December 20th, 1946 and didn&#8217;t gain much reception/theater release into January, 1947. In fact &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34; was not that popular (raking about 26th at the box office in 1947) upon it's original release, and like &#8220;A Christmas Story&#8221; didn&#8217;t become a Christmas classic in years later due to re-releases and eventual television airings. Outside of those two minor mistakes, I found nothing else wrong or disappointing about &#34;A Christmas Story 2&#34;. Go into this film without biased towards the original, and you&#8217;ll without a doubt enjoy this film.",4,"""A Christmas Story 2"" (2012)",1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,8675,"['34', 'A',

In theory this is a sequel to the original, Ralph is now almost 16 years old. In reality, they took virtually every story element of the original and simply reordered them or remade them. This is a remake, not a sequel.A Christmas Story is a classic film I have watched more times than I care to count, including in the theater the year it was released. I grew up in the Hammond, Indiana area (called Hohman, Indiana in the film, but Jean Shepard was writing about Hammond). The original film got the location, accent, and feel perfect (yes I know the house was really in Ohio, but they kept to the original location feel). The jokes were timed perfectly, and there was a thread of a story to hold everything together.Where A Christmas Story 2 goes wrong, the entire thing was filmed on a set in Vancouver, Canada area. They missed the feeling of Northwestern Indiana. They got the fifties sets wrong, everything was too bright. Why oh why did they change the house so much? That original craftsman style house was perfect. Somehow the Parkers moved to a brand new yellow tract house without ever mentioning it in this film (there were so many details talked about from the original, moving should have been huge). Hohman Downtown is completely different in this film; it didn't even try to be similar. Everything looks like California, not the Midwest.The story line is ridiculous. Where a Christmas Story had a lot of laughs, this film only had two decent laughs.Compared to the painfully awful My Summer Story (My Summer Story), at least the characters in this film are reasonably good. The Old Man and Mother are likeable. Randy is quirky good in the first half of the film, sadly the script takes him completely out of character later on - he makes some level of sense. The trio, Ralph, Schwartz, and Flick are pretty good. Unfortunately Flick ends up being a really bad caricature of Ed Norton on the Honeymooners.It is sad that a wonderful film like A Christmas Story was ruined. This new edition is bad. If it was a film about Ralph years later at almost age 16, and didn't try to recreate all the original gags, the film would have worked.

Holiday movie based on Jean Shepherd&#8217;s writings comes out in 1983, doesn&#8217;t exactly set the world on fire.  Then said movie hits cable and home video, and builds a following until it becomes a full-fledged Christmas icon and has its own 24-hour marathon.  Not to mention tons of merchandising, and so what happened almost 3 decades later was probably more inevitable than Mrs. Parker asking Ralphie what he wanted for Christmas.  Warner Premiere&#8217;s direct to DVD &#8220;official&#8221; sequel, &#8220;A Christmas Story 2.&#8221;  Yes, without using any Jean Shepherd material, nor Shep being here to offer input or a role.I&#8217;ve been a fan of &#8220;A Christmas Story&#8221; from the start, laughing at the commercials and going to the theater to see it when I was 6.  I&#8217;d always watch it on HBO, and as I grew up, I bought the VHS and later DVD.  I hope to one day take a trip to Cleveland to visit the Christmas Story House.  So I guess I was compelled either way to give this sequel a look, no matter the potential for a train wreck.&#8220;A Christmas Story 2&#8221; takes place six years after the original.  Ralphie is now 15 years old and has a new Christmas wish: a new car.  However, unlike his quest for the Red Ryder BB gun, this one takes a backseat to other wacky holiday time antics.  The car is actually the means to another end, as Ralphie wants to impress dream girl Drucilla (not Esther Jane, his love interest in the Shepherd stories who did cameo in the first movie).  And that too is overshadowed when Ralphie takes the car for a test drive and ends up wrecking it.  Now he must earn $85 to pay for the damage.  Can he do it, with the help of his ever-present friends Flick and Schwartz?  Meanwhile, kid brother Randy lives out Buck Rogers fantasies, the Old Man is still battling the furnace and has developed a sudden frugality (what happened to the &#8220;Arab trader&#8221; who&#8217;d make deals to get the perfect tree?) as well as an interest in ice fishing, and we get some appearances by familiar places, things, and jokes.And therein lays the first problem with this film.  It comes off as a glorified ad for the first movie (and its merchandise too, perhaps?), &#8220;highlighted&#8221; by the return of its most famous item, the Leg Lamp.  Other half-baked references include Ralphie&#8217;s car being wrecked in slow motion, as an excuse to revisit his &#8220;Ohhh fudge&#8221; exclamation; Flick voluntarily sticking his tongue into a pneumatic tube (seriously, he does it on his own accord, did his original experience make him a masochist?); and Ralphie using his earned money to take a homeless family to the Chop-Suey diner, which is rendered useless due to political correctness, but hey, at least you&#8217;re reminded to buy a figurine of the restaurant to complete your collection!Other than the shameless revisiting of the original, &#8220;A Christmas Story 2&#8221; also cannot shake the direct-to-DVD/borderline sitcom feel.  Indeed, a teen&#8217;s quest for a car, and having to raise money to make up for damage caused by some antic, are both hackneyed television tropes you would think would have been below Bob Clark&#8217;s standards (then again, he did direct &#8220;Baby Geniuses&#8221;&#8230;).  The movie&#8217;s highest profile star, Daniel Stern, plays the Old Man like a gruff caricature of Darren McGavin.  I am sure someone considered it &#8220;clever&#8221; casting because he was on a TV show where a narrator revisited his youth.  The subtle and charming humor of the original film is missing here as well, as seen in young Randy&#8217;s dropping of several S.O.B. bombs.  Remember how much you loved Ralphie doing the same after being duped by Little Orphan Annie?  You&#8217;ll love it being repeated in clusters, in the first few minutes of the film!  And where the original&#8217;s department store Santa was mostly scary because, well, store Santas are scary, the sequel&#8217;s Santa is a nasty man who can&#8217;t stop complaining about his wife&#8217;s affairs.The people behind &#8220;A Christmas Story 2&#8221; may not shoot their eye out, but they sure shot themselves in the foot.

I couldn't imagine him doing a bad job, and all the reviews stated they tried to stay true to the original.  So we rented it, gritted our teeth, and sat down expecting a little bit of a mess.Yes, it was a touch messy.  The Ralphie lead was overacted in almost a creepy way, and the obsessive attention to recreating the first movie's moments was almost jarring.  The ""fudg-g-g-g-g-g-g-e"" moment was funny in the first movie, and expected and pat in the second.  But it was Christmasy, so we hung in there and kept watching.  And we started to laugh.  And we kept laughing.  By the end, we were roaring.  (We ARE a family of movie laughers, granted.)The story (which is, after all, by Jean Shepherd - I remember listening to him on the radio as a child) started to slowly pull us in, and the antics of Ralphie and his friends in Higbees kept us in stitches.  And I thought, the problem is, this movie is suffering too much from comparison to the original.  Nothing can live up to that, and it does have some problems with overacting and too many strange gags.  But it DOES have heart.  The story had a good moral tone, and I'm not trying to spoil too much, but Ralphie needs to mend a mistake he made and owes money for.  How he finds a moral path helping others even though he's in a bit of a fix is a nice Christmas lesson movie.  And there are some nice twists at the end that are a lot of fun for those that enjoyed the original, including a new gift from Aunt Clara.So if you aren't so sophisticated that an imperfect movie is below you, and like a good laugh with the family, you may enjoy this.  Just don't expect too much from it as far as the first one being such a classic is concerned. Try to ignore a lot of the acting and lesser production values.  It does have Christmas spirit, and we actually went out and bought the hard copy after the rental so it will be a classic in OUR house, at least.  It is a family happy feelgood movie, and if that sounds nice to you, you'll probably like this.",5,Give it a chance - it's a fun family outing with heart.,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,2124,"['Being', 'aficionado', 'classic', 'family', 'movies', 'wanted', 'give', 'try', 'ever', 'saw', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'played', 'Dad', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'doing', 'bad', 'job', 'reviews', 'stated', 'tried', 'stay', 'true', 'original', 'rented', 'gritted', 'teeth', 'sat', 'down', 'expecting', 'little', 'bit', 'mess.Yes', 'was', 'touch', 'messy', 'Ralphie', 'lead', 'was', 'overacted', 'almost', 'creepy', 'way', 'obsessive', 'attention', 'recreating', 'first', 'movie', 'moments', 'was', 'almost', 'jarring', 'fudg-g-g-g-g-g-g-e', 'moment', 'was', 'funny', 'first', 'movie', 'expected', 'pat', 'second', 'was', 'Christmasy', 'hung', 'kept', 'watching', 'started', 'laugh', 'kept', 'laughing', 'end', 'were', 'roaring', 'ARE', 'family', 'movie', 'laughers', 'granted', 'story', 'Jean', 'Shepherd', 'remember', 'listening', 'radio', 'child', 'started', 'slowly', 'pull', 'antics', 'Ralphie', 'friends', 'Higbees', 'kept', 'stitches', 'thought', 'problem', 'movie', 'suffering', 'too', 'much', 'comparison', 'original', 'Nothing', 'can', 'live', 'up', 'have', 'problems', 'overacting', 'too', 'many', 'strange', 'gags', 'DOES', 'have', 'heart', 'story', 'had', 'good', 'moral', 'tone', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'spoil', 'too', 'much', 'Ralphie', 'mend', 'mistake', 'made', 'owes', 'money', 'How', 'moral', 'path', 'helping', 'others', 'even', 'bit', 'fix', 'nice', 'Christmas', 'lesson', 'movie', 'are', 'nice', 'twists', 'end', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'including', 'new', 'gift', 'Aunt', 'Clara.So', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'sophisticated', 'imperfect', 'movie', 'good', 'laugh', 'family', 'may', 'enjoy', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'as', 'far', 'first', 'one', 'being', 'such', 'classic', 'concerned', 'Try', 'ignore', 'lot', 'acting', 'lesser', 'production', 'values', 'have', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'actually', 'went', 'bought', 'hard', 'copy', 'rental', 'will', 'be', 'classic', 'OUR', 'house', 'least', 'family', 'happy', 'feelgood', 'movie', 'nice', ""'ll"", 'probably']",N/A

The &#34;Old Man&#34; missed the mark because it wasn't written right. This old man is grumpy and antagonistic toward mom. None of that was part of the first movie. Randy is all wrong.

Ralphie (Lemasters) is a few years older and it's Christmas time again. This year instead of a gun he wants a car. When he is testing out how it feels behind the wheel an accident happens and he owes the dealer $85. When his dad (Stern) refuses to help him and his friends get jobs, which turns out to be a huge adventure. I have to admit I was very skeptical going in to this movie. I loved the first one but after seeing ""Christmas Vacation 2 : Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure"" I am a little leery about sequels to classic movies. This was better then that one but this is still nothing to rush out and see. Stern is a little over the top and every other scene is him yelling at the furnace. They try to just re-hash the funny gags from the original but they aren't funny in this one. Pretty much the movie is what you would expect and most people will watch it out of curiosity, like I did. Overall, I was expecting worse but this is still forgettable and not really worth seeing. I give it a C.",3,Actually better then I expected but still not all that good. Tried to redo gags from original but not as funny.

The most recent incarnation was in 1994 with a film called 'My Summer Story'... with Kieran Culkin as Ralphie and Charles Grodin as The Old Man.Those seven movies however spanning from 76 to 94 (Christmas Story was the fourth, released in 1983) while all starring a completely different cast of actors, and even spanning different eras of Ralphies life have one major thing in common. Narration from the storys originator; columnist and radio personality Jean Shepherd. He passed away back in 1999.While I'm sure SOME of the script is in someway adapted from Jeans own writings (however little, as a good amount of the film seems to just want to revisit jokes from the old Christmas Story...) The fact that it isn't him reading is a major loss. Other titles in the series worked mainly due to the terrific and unique narrative--not necesarilly due to good acting by the players. This time around everything is fake, but since it is still rooted in original source material, not ALL is lost... just most of it! Obviously this does not come even close to warranting rewatch value as much as the original, nor will it touch our hearts with that warm mellow glow in the same way that only the original 'Christmas Story' could.",3,I WON ANOTHER LEG LAMP!

While it held no surprises, it was certainly entertaining.  While predictable, the characters still brought that warm feeling expected from a Christmas movie.  I doubt this one could go any farther unless thes fast forward to when the kids are grown with kids of their own.  Probably best not to give the guys in production any ideas.
