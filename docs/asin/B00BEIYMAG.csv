Some people may remember their names for their involvement with &#8220;the Amityville haunting&#8221; in Long Island, which became the basis of a 1979 film &#8220;The Amityville Horror.&#8221;James Wan&#8217;s latest film is a clever re-working of the 1970s-style old-fashioned horror genre. &#8220;The Conjuring&#8221; is about an actual case of the Perron family &#8211; husband and wife Roger and Carolyn Perron (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor), who moved into a dilapidated farmhouse in Rhode Island with their five daughters. Believing their house is haunted, they ask the Warrens to investigate.The storyline itself is simple, even familiar. With the atmospheric photography and production design, however, the film manages to be very creepy. What makes the film really work is that scares are delivered in a subtle way, especially in the first half of the film. I never thought handclapping could be this scary.And perhaps most importantly, thanks to the strong acting from the cast we really care about the characters, even when the skeptics in us refuse to believe their story.

The way I've always seen it, the best case scenario says that the Warrens truly believe in what they do and they offer a sense of closure to those who employ them. The worst case scenario says that they are shameless con artists manipulating the fears of those who employ them. The Conjuring didn't make me believe that they were the real deal - but it made me want to. Much of the credit goes to the talented and eclectic cast, something horror films rarely use any sort of budget on. The Conjuring works with a less is more approach, that what they don't show you can often be much scarier than what they do. It's effectively creepy with minimal gore. The story is a simple haunted house tale but it moves at a good pace and the end result left me satisfied.

You wouldn't think there would be anything to add to the genre but &#34;The Conjuring&#34; contradicts that theory.  The beauty of James Wan's film is it references old films with a modern touch.  I spotted the influence of the classic Hammer films, Robert Wise's &#34;The Haunting&#34;, and, yes, William Friedkin's &#34;The Exorcist&#34;.  I think what distinguishes this film from others of its ilk is its humanity.  We actually have characters to root for instead of a bloodfeast.  When the tormented family's dog is killed by the malevolent force you cry along with the kids.  When the mother(Lili Taylor) is possessed by same entity you feel the pain of her kin.  I think what elevates the film is its two main characters, Ed and Larraine Warren)Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga), married paranormalists who along with the love for one another share a religious conviction.  The Warrens are based on real persons and I would love to see them in future cinematic ventures.  &#34;The Conjuring&#34; is an intelligent film that I would wholeheartedly recommend to even those who are not horror buffs.",5,An Exorcism Without Cussing,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,1165,"['Horror', 'been', 'mainstay', 'cinema', 'silent', 'movie', 'era', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'anything', 'add', 'genre', '34', 'Conjuring', '34', 'contradicts', 'theory', 'beauty', 'James', 'Wan', 'film', 'old', 'films', 'modern', 'touch', 'spotted', 'influence', 'classic', 'Hammer', 'films', 'Robert', 'Wise', '34', 'Haunting', '34', 'yes', 'William', 'Friedkin', '34', 'Exorcist', '34', 'think', 'what', 'film', 'others', 'ilk', 'humanity', 'actually', 'have', 'characters', 'root', 'instead', 'bloodfeast', 'When', 'tormented', 'family', 'dog', 'killed', 'malevolent', 'force', 'cry', 'along', 'kids', 'When', 'mother', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'possessed', 'same', 'entity', 'feel', 'pain', 'kin', 'think', 'what', 'film', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Ed', 'Larraine', 'Warren', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'married', 'paranormalists', 'who', 'love', 'one', 'share', 'religious', 'conviction', 'Warrens', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'persons', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'future', 'cinematic', 'ventures', '34', 'Conjuring', '34', 'intelligent', 'film', 'would', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'horror', 'buffs']",N/A

1630001,A9H09HAV19HKO,B00BEIYMAG,,"[0, 0]","I generally do not buy horror flicks, or anything demonic, vulger and profanity without ceasing. I bought this because it is true and I was aware of it for years, and it involved Ed and Lorraine Warren. Well known and respected demonologists and Christians. I was tempted to go with 5 stars, but feel better with 4. I don't want to encourage the wrong ones to watch this. It is not for children!When it arrived, I told my brother & hubby, &#34;Look, I am not sure what to expect from this movie, I didn't get a rating, so if it is too much, I'll shut it down. But, I know it is a true haunting.&#34;  They both wanted to check it out and we watched it all the way through.They liked it, but it scared them to know it was real. They both knew my history and I gained some respect from each of them for what I went through. I told few people at the time, knowing they would think me crazy. My Christian Agent, stayed with me one night after I broke down & told him what was going on. Well, I made a believer out of him, but he took over and cleaned the house for a couple of days. I had two young teenagers that I sent to live with their father until I could get out of the lease. I feared for their safety. I wasn't really scared for myself the first six months. I knew I had angels looking over me too for a while. But, the darker it got and my not doing anything about it, I was in a war zone of my own, feeling on my own. So, short of two years later, every thing seemed to escalate & my children became afraid. My point is, these things do happen, to good people. I just wasn't as good at the time. I was angry at God over my divorce, some deaths and other things, and took my eyes off of Him.My only problem with the right help, is having to go through the Catholic Church for approval, when it can take months. At times, that is too late. So, I say find a holy, bold, Evangelical Pastor, that follows the scriptures that gives us dominion over these evil spirits. But, those too, can be hard to find.The horror is real, very real and although I am a Christian, I lived in a haunted house for two & a half years. Therefore, I know these things happen, but I do not encourage anybody to test the spirits or get involved with the dark side. Yes, there is a dark world out there. This movie was very accurate, as I remember it. Well acted, but maybe just a tinge of embelishment, but not too much. It was a hell on earth. I was so thrilled they had the sense to call in the Warrens.If you want to be scared, then buy the movie, but never forget, it was real, it happened and still happens today, but even more. So, if you watch it, do not be tempted in any way, unless it is to turn in the right direction. There are only two directions, that's up or down. I recommend it for educational reasons, or if you are going through any haunting yourself. Again, I do caution all who watch it.",4,Be prepared,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,2886,"['generally', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'horror', 'flicks', 'anything', 'demonic', 'vulger', 'profanity', 'ceasing', 'bought', 'true', 'was', 'aware', 'years', 'involved', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'Well', 'known', 'respected', 'demonologists', 'Christians', 'was', 'tempted', 'go', '5', 'stars', 'feel', 'better', '4', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'encourage', 'wrong', 'ones', 'watch', 'not', 'children', 'When', 'arrived', 'told', 'brother', 'hubby', '34', 'Look', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'rating', 'so', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'shut', 'down', 'know', 'true', 'haunting.', '34', 'wanted', 'check', 'out', 'watched', 'way', 'through.They', 'liked', 'scared', 'know', 'was', 'real', 'knew', 'history', 'gained', 'respect', 'what', 'went', 'told', 'few', 'people', 'time', 'knowing', 'would', 'think', 'crazy', 'Christian', 'Agent', 'stayed', 'one', 'night', 'broke', 'down', 'told', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Well', 'made', 'believer', 'took', 'over', 'cleaned', 'house', 'couple', 'days', 'had', 'two', 'young', 'teenagers', 'sent', 'live', 'father', 'could', 'get', 'lease', 'feared', 'safety', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'scared', 'first', 'six', 'months', 'knew', 'had', 'angels', 'looking', 'too', 'while', 'darker', 'got', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'was', 'war', 'zone', 'own', 'feeling', 'own', 'So', 'short', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'thing', 'seemed', 'escalate', 'children', 'became', 'afraid', 'point', 'things', 'do', 'happen', 'good', 'people', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'time', 'was', 'angry', 'God', 'divorce', 'deaths', 'other', 'things', 'took', 'eyes', 'Him.My', 'only', 'problem', 'right', 'help', 'having', 'go', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'approval', 'when', 'can', 'take', 'months', 'times', 'too', 'late', 'So', 'say', 'find', 'holy', 'bold', 'Evangelical', 'Pastor', 'scriptures', 'dominion', 'evil', 'spirits', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'find.The', 'horror', 'real', 'very', 'real', 'am', 'Christian', 'lived', 'haunted', 'house', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'Therefore', 'know', 'things', 'happen', 'do', 'not', 'encourage', 'anybody', 'test', 'spirits', 'get', 'involved', 'dark', 'side', 'Yes', 'dark', 'world', 'there', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'accurate', 'remember', 'Well', 'acted', 'maybe', 'just', 'tinge', 'embelishment', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'hell', 'earth', 'was', 'so', 'thrilled', 'had', 'sense', 'call', 'Warrens.If', 'want', 'be', 'scared', 'then', 'buy', 'movie', 'never', 'forget', 'was', 'real', 'happened', 'still', 'today', 'even', 'more', 'So', 'watch', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'tempted', 'way', 'turn', 'right', 'direction', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'directions', 'up', 'down', 'recommend', 'educational', 'reasons', 'are', 'going', 'haunting', 'Again', 'do', 'caution', 'who', 'watch']",N/A

In some ways a film within a film, I was initially skeptical of the movie because droves of people told me how bad it sucked.  We must have seen a different movie.  James Wan *never* fails to deliver these days, it would seem.The story begins in 1971, as Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger Perron (Ron Livingston) move their family into a dilapidated Rhode Island farm house and soon strange things start happening around it with escalating nightmarish terror. In desperation, Carolyn contacts the noted paranormal investigators, Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), to examine the house. What the Warrens discover is a whole area steeped in a satanic haunting that is now targeting the Perron family wherever they go. To stop this evil, the Warrens will have to call upon all their skills and spiritual strength to defeat this spectral menace at its source that threatens to destroy everyone involved.It sounds like a redux of the Amityville Horror, and in some ways is, with lots of digital sheen and an increased amount of interpersonal tension: Ed and Lorraine, unbeknownst to the Perron family until later, are struggling with their paranormal abilities due to a failed exorcism they helped conduct in which a man died and Lorraine saw something that scared her nearly to death.  They have a collection of &#34;artifacts&#34; which come from each of their expeditions, and which a handyman wisely suggests they burn.  They will find another one from this one expedition as well, a sort of strange music box...I have to say that Lili Taylor shines as the Jersey housewife who ends up being the victim of possession.  The way her face contorts, the bravery of her performance, just everything, is perfect.  She scared the hell out of me.

1630042,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00BEIYMAG,,"[0, 1]","Since people have had the ability to tell stories, they've liked to scare one another. Monsters and goblins, ghouls and ghosts; it's all in good fun, or at least it used to be. Ever since William Friedkin's THE EXORCIST (which is still the gold standard in supernatural terror), stories of ghosts and demons have gotten a little less fun and a lot more nihilistic. And while THE EXORCIST has moments where you can catch your breath and have a little fun with the characters, more and more films lately have been notching up the fear factor until you just can't breathe at all, and these films end up being more of an exercise in endless panic and utter nihilism than a smart and well-balanced scary movie. But every once in a great while in the horror genre, there comes a film that allows fear to creep in around the edges rather than constantly erupting all over the audience and James Wan's THE CONJURING is one of those rare films.It begins with a prologue, first detailing that this is based on a true story, starting in 1969 of the husband-wife paranormal investigator team of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) as they investigate some very creepy goings-on with a very creepy doll that has been possessed. Then, onward to 1971, where we meet the Perron family, a clean-cut cute family with mother Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and father Roger (Ron Livingston) and their five young daughters moving into an old farmhouse in New England. Everything seems idyllic until things start... happening. Loud thumping, smells of rotting meat, strange and creepy objects, tugs on the legs of the children, inexplicable brusing, until the madness implodes one night and they come in search of people that will believe them, and more importantly, help them. This leads them to the Warrens. Of this couple, Ed is the more logical and pragmatic of the couple, looking to actually leave this life behind them for a while so they can spend more time with their daughter. Lorraine is the emotional core, though, who leads with her heart and her apparent extrasensory abilities, and knows that the Perrons need them. Things go back to normal (or so it seems) when the Warrens and their investigative team enter the house, but things quickly start to go very badly for both families as the source of the mystery of this house is solved, and the house, and the evil spirit contained within, begins fighting back.What makes this film special is the nature of how things progress. Everything seems, for lack of a better term, real. It takes the ages-old haunted house tale, and makes it somewhat procedural in nature. The investigation by the Warrens and their team is something that doesn't seem to be part of many of these types of films. Everything seems to have its place. The film also allows us to care about the families by learning about them outside of just the otherworldly threat. They have everyday conversations; they have problems that people can relate to other than just sharing a paranormal event and Wan is smart enough to include those moments. It makes it scarier to the audience to have people we care about in danger rather than just showing the audience people in danger and have them try and form an emotional connection with them. This is old-school horror filmmaking and it's kind of glorious, particularly coming from the director who introduced us to the SAW franchise. Performance-wise, pretty much everyone is at the top of their game, particularly the leading ladies of Farmiga and Taylor.There are certain elements that are seem a little too pat, such as the investigation into the history of the house, but this is a pretty economical film in terms of exposition. It wants to concentrate as much on the characters as it does the mystery and the terror of the situations, another rarity in horror. If anything, this film is something of the heir-apparent to the last truly great haunted-house film, Tobe Hooper/Steven Spielberg's POLTERGEIST. It blends all of the elements of strong storytelling without going too far and leaving us without hope, as most of the modern horror films are wont to do. It also seems like it relies much more on practical effects rather than the over-use of CG effects, which is also a nice change of pace. But for the life of me, I cannot understand why this film is R-Rated. There's no real gore that you couldn't see on network TV, not really any ""suggestive dialogue"", and zero nudity. This wouldn't be a film I would invite a seven-year-old to see, but there seems to be no reason other than it seems to be made smarter and for a more mature audience than most of the PG-13 horror that tends to clog up the cinemas.THE CONJURING is one of the best haunted house films in a long time, and a film that gives us hope that people can still make scary films that are also intelligent and

While many movies have forgotten that sometimes what is so terryfying is what the mind creates and not how much gore can be thrown on the screen the conjuring remembered. There are some cheap scares but not enough to ruin things. And although the narrative is based on a true story i still think it would be effective regardless. The acting was very well done as well.

The Brady Bunch move into a haunted house and find a cellar that was boarded up.

Better call for an exorcism before someone throws more balls around the basement and stops clocks from ticking. Uh, oh.

1630062,A24JDJQWQDDH14,B00BEIYMAG,,"[1, 4]","It's remarkable that in a genre expressly designed to scare people, so few of its entries actually accomplish that goal. But The Conjuring absolutely does. Smarter and more consistent than all of the Paranormal Activity films put together, James Wan's interim project between Insidious installments exudes both studio respectability and grindhouse urgency.All of which is why hyperbole aside, The Conjuring is the closest thing to a horror classic modern audiences are likely to get, particularly in an era when genre offerings seem to be at their most disposable.Ron Livingston (Dinner For Schmucks) and Lily Taylor (Being Flynn) play Roger and Carolyn Perron, parents of a quartet of girls who move into a Rhode Island farmhouse only to quickly discover that it's possessed by supernatural forces. After exhausting all possibilities of dealing with the unseen menace, Roger reaches out to Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), well-known paranormal researchers who have a reputation for eliminating similar threats. But even the veteran investigators begin to think they may be in over their heads after the evil force initiates increasingly violent attacks on the Perrons, forcing them to confront their own painful past as they try to help Roger and Carolyn preserve their family's future.Although it certainly utilizes many of the hallmarks of other recent paranormal, possession-oriented movies in order to exert its influence on the audience, The Conjuring succeeds for three reasons which might not seem obvious except in comparison to their absence in those predecessors. The first of these is the fact that it's consistent: from the film's opening scenes to its finale, something is always happening. In the Paranormal Activity films, for example, much time is devoted to introducing the characters and then feebly attempting to justify the constant use of cameras in every corner of the house. In Wan's film, the first scene highlights the Warrens' expertise with a ""case study"" featuring a particularly creepy doll, and the last resolves the escalation of supernatural activity that takes place in the Perrons' home. And in between, virtually every passing day and night features at least one frightening moment, often repeated in just a delicate enough way that it both keeps the threat palpable while allowing space for it to evolve or intensify.Secondarily, what happens to the Perrons happens to all of them. In far too many horror movies, one character will find him- or herself persistently attacked by some evil force, only for no one else around him or her to see it. As a result much of the film's running time is spent questioning whether or not anything is truly happening. In The Conjuring, the supernatural force essentially goes after anyone and everyone in the Perron family indiscriminately, creating unpredictability --and maybe more importantly, a collective acceptance that this is occurring --that keeps the characters and the audience on edge.Third, the film (or the characters) makes almost no stupid decisions, which is a rarity in a film of any sort these days, but is exceptional in a horror film where, as a byproduct of poor writing or maybe just storytelling necessity, they seem to occur with maddening frequency. In fact, there's a completeness to Wan's vision here that seems to preclude even the possibility of stupidity: the characters take rational steps to explore and address the supernatural problem. The movie gives them the credit of being blindsided by this evil force rather than having them more or less submit themselves to scenarios where scary stuff occurs. And once the investigators join the Perrons in the house, they set up cameras and recording devices in every corner. This creates a sort of first-generation found footage movie within a movie, and eliminates the ""nobody believes me"" argument from the characters' usual repertoire of excuses why their problems continue to intensify.Wan's interest in making an old-fashioned studio horror film pays off handsomely, because it showcases both the creativity that he developed on independent and low-budget projects and the refinement and maturity he achieved while making those movies. While the movie doesn't skimp on gruesome imagery of ghastly figures and evil spirits, some of its greatest moments of suspense occur while little girls are peering, terrified, into dark corners of their bedrooms where there seems to be no one at all. This sort of expert audience manipulation doesn't come purely from scrimping and saving and working within budgetary constraints that prohibit the filmmakers from showing their monsters. It comes from truly understanding what is scary and how to maximize that suspense,with or without the money to show the monster that will eventually invade viewers' nightmares.Evidently, The Conjuring is based on case files of the real Ed and Lorraine Warren, who also investigated the house that would become the setting of the iconic `70s horror film The Amityville Horror. I can't speak to the film's accuracy in depicting the events in question, and I generally speaking have no sense of spirituality to bounce off of the events in the film. But there are things in Wan's film that, for the sake of me sleeping soundly, I'd prefer never to see again. The Conjuring creates such an intense and consistent atmosphere of suspense that I would give it my highest recommendations, and yet it's something I will probably never watch again.That said, it's not perfect; the ""case study"" footage at the beginning, for example, is assembled half as a collection of clinical interviews and half as a mini-horror movie. A later return to that storyline --inside the Warrens' house while Ed attempts to stage an impromptu exorcism at the Perrons' pays off in terror, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense logistically. And some of the finale in the Perrons' house unfolds more like Evil Dead than a bona fide demonic possession, whatever that would perhaps more plausibly look like. But in a movie where shadows are as scary as the most detailed monster make-up, these shortcomings are few and far between. That Wan shows, say, only an incidental shot of the hanging feet of a past victim instead of a ghastly close-up of the entire corpse is a testament to his restraint, and his growing sophistication, as one of the industry's top purveyors of legitimate and long-lasting scares.The greatest transition that Wan has made since the beginning of his career is one fundamental to the growth of the genre as a whole: moving away from the graphic brutality that was a staple of so much of the past decade's horror movies towards something more emotionally resonant. By ""emotionally resonant,"" that doesn't necessarily mean that Wan is attempting to leave long-lasting, deep-rooted emotional damage as a result of scaring his audience. Rather, it refers to his ability to maximize those viewers' willingness to give themselves over to the experience of watching something, caring about characters and story, and coming out feeling as if there was some effect exerted upon their lives other than rank disgust. Although it was certainly effective (and the best in the series), Saw was a showcase for inflicting pain, contextualized as a series of moral dilemmas. This film chronicles the considerably more relatable struggle for one family to achieve the American dream challenged by an otherworldly threat.Of course, Wan's latest isn't the first horror film to explore that idea, or even the first since his Saw days to do so. But The Conjuring is probably the best, certainly in a long time. Thoughtful where its competition is glib, featuring substantive and relatable characters, and steadily-paced where most feel lackadaisical, rushed or uneven, Wan has made a truly great movie. And I'm only talking about the parts that I saw from between my fingers.",5,A horror classic!,1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,7902,"['remarkable', 'genre', 'expressly', 'designed', 'scare', 'people',

1630072,A391AS877NJKUB,B00BEIYMAG,,"[28, 76]","What is a ""true story""? Inception is a story, and as far as we accept that it's a story, there's a truth to the events. When we watch the movie, we are all witnessing the same story, and therefore, we can agree on objective facts about the story. There are characters. They have names. Events happen in a particular order. These are all truths, and so something must exist beyond the fiction for us to call a ""true story"". I have no doubt in my mind that the Warrens, those fantastic hucksters, have woven a narrative surrounding this family and some possibly difficult times for them. The question, however, is whether that story, which is itself a truth, accurately reflects reality, or if it was spawned from the imagination with little or no help from reality. That's an important question, even more than just asking ""Is it a good horror movie?"", because now the movie is requiring us to suspend our suspension of disbelief. Anytime I watch a horror movie or play a scary game, I have to temporarily disconnect myself from the world I know (suspend my disbelief), otherwise I will never be immersed enough to achieve catharsis, and the whole experience will be a waste of my time. Indeed, the effort on the part of the creator will be a failure as well, as this is the entire point of storytelling, insofar as I can tell. Because The Conjuring is claimed to be a story that accurately reflects reality (members from the Perron family and the remaining Warren both assert this), I now have to prevent myself from suspending my disbelief in the movie, instead suspending my belief in reality (which is considerably harder to do because I have a lot more experience in reality than I do in the Warren's distorted, funhouse mirror version of it).**Spoilers here**The Warrens are a religious people. Their take on the supernatural has a distinctly Biblical tone. The plot could only seem reasonable to the Biblically inclined. I would even say that it's an embarrassingly bad plot, even compared to other religiously themed horror movies, which almost always fall on the poor side of a genre that typically produces poor material to begin with.***Last chance spoiler alert***The primary antagonistic entity is a witch. Yeah, a witch. One of the ""first to be condemned in the Salem witch trials"", to paraphrase Loraine from the movie. The witch sacrificed her newborn to Satan, and then committed suicide, which gave her spirit a great deal of physical power (of course.... of course). There are some other ghosts that make a brief appearance, all victims of the witch's power to make a mother kill her child. This is what witches do, no doubt, and clearly those fundamentalist maniacs running the witch trials were right to murder two dozen people - there was a real witch! She actually got power from Satan, and 200 years later, the Warrens were there to finally save the day, God be praised! So, in order to suspend my disbelief for this movie, I have to accept not only the Warrens' version of events, but various Christian doctrines and the ""prosecutors"" of the Salem witch trials. As a result, rather than scaring, or even interesting me, this movie just had me rolling my eyes. Often times, such movies will at least allow a character to go through a crisis of faith, and then I can find value in it - either they lose it entirely, or they regain it with a new understanding, but regardless, the character develops in some way. No so for this shameless faith-fest, where not only does the nasty witch get defeated sans character development, but it's a simple Christian ritual that saves the day, as though there could be no other possibility. True story!**End of spoilers***Aside from the inherent ridiculousness of the plot, the movie is generally lame in every other dimension. The scares were typical, uninspired rip offs of every other haunted house movie. This is likely because so many movies we're familiar with today are themselves ripping off the Amityville horror, which is another true fiction from the minds of the Warrens. The acting was generally awful whenever it called for an emotion other than 'frozen in terror''. The dialog is clunky and as difficult to believe as the rest of the film, and it certainly felt like the actors had better things they could be doing with their lives at the time. Characters were cardboard cutouts that stood in for anything we might relate to as a human being, but being so thin, fail to inspire empathy. To be sure, the worst part of the movie is the lack of any real progression from the characters. A true story must still be a story regardless of how well it reflects reality, and for a story to be a story, we have to find the characters sufficiently believable. Instead, no one had any personality, which is surprising for characters based on ""real"" people. No one changed. No one grew, or learned, or became anything different by the end of the movie. Every face in the film is an empty vessel, and watching them was both painful and boring.For those of you who are wondering whether to watch this movie, chances are good that no amount of bad reviews will put you off. You're either too bored to care, or you're a horror junky and will watch even the crappiest of the crap. If you're a fan of the Warrens, you've probably already watched it and won't be reading this review. If I can sway you from this film, then please accept this warning and go watch something worth your time. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a good one with overt Christian themes, if that's your thing. The Innkeepers, the Woman in Black or Sinister could fulfill your supernatural needs much better. If you can't find a movie that will be a suitable replacement, then think about a new hobby. Music, photography, chess or stamp collecting would all be a far better use of your time. Failing even a new hobby, try just knocking yourself unconscious somehow. Anything is better than sitting through the latest tripe from James Wan, and certainly better than giving more money to the Warrens. The only truth to this story is that the story is so truly bad, and told is such a lackluster, empty and vapid way that a potentially entertaining horror movie becomes a frustrating exercise in reconciling your view of reality with a liar's tale.",1,"Just what is a ""true story"", anyways? *Spoilers*",1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,6272,"['What', 'true', 'story', 'Inception', 'story', 'as',

1630074,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00BEIYMAG,,"[3, 4]","&#34;The Conjuring&#34; is my favorite type of supernatural horror film. It has deeper meaning to it than just getting people scared. Everything about it is top shelf solid quality horror. I also applaud any movie that makes people think about the reality of God and the Devil.The Perron family is terrorized by what they come to believe is a spiritual presence in their home. Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren come to the family's aid and discover that it's not only haunted but dwelled in by the demonic spirit of a witch who cursed the land she was hung on. Can the Warrens find a way to rid the house of the evil before it takes a tragic toll on the Perrons?Although it's based on actual events, everyone knows &#34;The Conjuring&#34; has been sensationalized for a movie-going audience. That doesn't change the fact that it demands its audience ponder the existence of a spiritual world outside of the physical one we can see, touch, hear, and smell. It also makes a point of letting you know that just because you don't believe in something doesn't mean it's not real.The biggest scares you'll get from &#34;The Conjuring&#34; aren't even necessarily the ones you'll see and hear onscreen. I found myself more frightened after the film ended. I was left thinking about it in the &#34;real&#34; world. That's the beauty of a great horror film - it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.Let's just call it like it is. &#34;The Conjuring&#34; is the &#34;Amityville Horror&#34; of this decade. There's a lot of speculation around the Amityville house, but it's famous and put this movie's paranormal detectives in in the headlines and on TV. This is a story so fascinating that you don't want to believe it. However, somewhere in the back of your head you know it's true.&#34;The Conjuring&#34; is rated R for sequences of disturbing violence and terror. There's no nudity in the film. Some bad language can be found as well.The DVD version of &#34;The Conjuring&#34; includes a short featurette taking viewers behind the scenes of the film. It's entitled &#34;Scaring the &#34;@$*%&#34; Out of You&#34; and features interviews with the cast and crew. It's not much, but gives you an insight into what it takes to make this type of film.Many Christians and religious folks will no doubt disagree with demonic possession being used as a vehicle for entertainment. I look at it as an opportunity to expose and educate a generation of people who have come to believe in nothing and just live life the best they can in spiritual darkness. I know that's pretty heavy thinking put into what most look at as a horror movie.&#34;The Conjuring&#34; has everything you could want in one supernatural film. There's the old creepy house, demons, ghosts, a hanging tree, a freaky doll, and so much more. I can't think of a single genre item it missed. The funny thing is, it doesn't feel over-stuffed or like it's going to burst at the seams. It's just a good old-fashioned supernatural thriller that will entertain and make the audience ponder it well past the closing credits.",4,"""The Conjuring"" is a Thrilling Look at the World of the Supernatural",1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,3094,"['34', 'Conjuring', '34', 'favorite', 'type', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'film', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'just', 'getting', 'people', 'scared', 'Everything', 'top', 'shelf', 'solid', 'quality', 'horror', 'also', 'applaud', 'movie', 'people', 'think', 'reality', 'God', 'Devil.The', 'Perron', 'family', 'terrorized', 'what', 'come', 'believe', 'spiritual', 'presence', 'home', 'Paranormal', 'investigators', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'come', 'family', 'aid', 'discover', 'not', 'only', 'haunted', 'dwelled', 'demonic', 'spirit', 'witch', 'who', 'cursed', 'land', 'was', 'hung', 'Can', 'Warrens', 'find', 'way', 'rid', 'house', 'evil', 'tragic', 'toll', 'Perrons', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'everyone', '34', 'Conjuring', '34', 'been', 'sensationalized', 'movie-going', 'audience', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'audience', 'ponder', 'existence', 'spiritual', 'world', 'physical', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'touch', 'hear', 'smell', 'also', 'point', 'letting', 'know', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'something', ""n't"", 'mean', 'not', 'real.The', 'biggest', 'scares', ""'ll"", 'get', '34', 'Conjuring', '34', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'necessarily', 'ones', ""'ll"", 'see', 'hear', 'onscreen', 'found', 'more', 'frightened', 'film', 'ended', 'was', 'left', 'thinking', '34', 'real', '34', 'world', 'beauty', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled.Let', 'just', 'call', '34', 'Conjuring', '34', '34', 'Amityville', 'Horror', '34', 'decade', 'lot', 'speculation', 'Amityville', 'house', 'famous', 'put', 'movie', 'paranormal', 'detectives', 'headlines', 'TV', 'story', 'so', 'fascinating', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'However', 'somewhere', 'back', 'head', 'know', 'true.', '34', 'Conjuring', '34', 'rated', 'R', 'sequences', 'disturbing', 'violence', 'terror', 'nudity', 'film', 'bad', 'language', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'well.The', 'DVD', 'version', '34', 'Conjuring', '34', 'short', 'featurette', 'taking', 'viewers', 'scenes', 'film', 'entitled', '34', 'Scaring', '34', '@', '*', '%', '34', 'Out', '34', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'not', 'much', 'insight', 'what', 'make', 'type', 'film.Many', 'Christians', 'religious', 'folks', 'will', 'doubt', 'disagree', 'demonic', 'possession', 'being', 'used', 'vehicle', 'entertainment', 'look', 'opportunity', 'expose', 'educate', 'generation', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'believe', 'nothing', 'just', 'live', 'life', 'best', 'can', 'spiritual', 'darkness', 'know', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'thinking', 'put', 'what', 'most', 'look', 'horror', 'movie.', '34', 'Conjuring', '34', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'one', 'supernatural', 'film', 'old', 'creepy', 'house', 'demons', 'ghosts', 'hanging', 'tree', 'freaky', 'doll', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'genre', 'item', 'missed', 'funny', 'thing', ""n't"", 'feel', 'over-stuffed', 'going', 'burst', 'seams', 'just', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'will', 'entertain', 'make', 'audience', 'ponder', 'well', 'closing', 'credits']",N/A

1630077,A24DMQT858FRC4,B00BEIYMAG,,"[3, 4]","The majority of reviewers is right: done before, seen before. An enjoyable flick, though, well, to a point.. Even though it &#34;loans&#34; from such archetypes as Amityville, The Exorcist and the Legend of Hell House (to name but a few). My general impression, though, is that some (perhaps significant) sequences are missing (or were cut for whatever reason in the editing room), and as a result there is a general feeling of dangling scenario avenues, of incoherence - it never becomes really frightening.

1630078,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00BEIYMAG,,"[3, 5]","**1/2The main problem with a movie like &#8220;The Conjuring&#8221; is that it assumes that none of us have ever been to a haunted house movie before (perhaps not an entirely unwarranted assumption given that the characters in these movies clearly never have or they&#8216;d know better than to move into one of these houses in the first place).You know the drill. Unsuspecting family from the city buys an old place in the country. Weird things begin to happen. Ghostbusters are brought in to investigate. Turns out some restless spirits, the victims of various ghastly crimes in the past, are roaming around the place searching for someone to free them from their predicament so they can move on and find eternal peace. Supernatural pandemonium ensues. Roll credits. The End.This one is set in 1971 (the girls are watching &#8220;Brady Bunch&#8220; reruns in the middle of the afternoon long before the show ever went into syndication, but then I doubt that facts are high on the agenda for these filmmakers). Lily Taylor and Ron Livingston play the parents of five daughters who become bedeviled by some evil forces lurking in the dark recesses of the creaky old fixer-upper they&#8217;ve purchased in rural Rhode Island. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are the world-famous paranormal researchers, the Warrens, who attempt to exorcise the demons from the place.The kind of movie for which a spoiler alert is practically superfluous, &#8220;The Conjuring&#8221; is allegedly based on a true story, a come-on that might have been more convincing had the movie not seemed so much like every other haunted house movie we&#8217;ve ever seen. I&#8217;d like to believe that even ghosts can&#8217;t be this boringly predictable.Maybe someday someone somewhere will come up with something new that will breathe some much-needed life into the genre.

1630082,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00BEIYMAG,,"[3, 5]","There are three basic reviews of this film.THE BELIEVER: Best movie ever, especially when you consider that it's BASED ON A TRUE STORY! So scary to think that there's that kind of evil in the world, but also so reaffirming that there are God-fearing people like the Warren's doing the Lord's good work. Oh, also the movie was well-done.THE NON-BELIEVER: Stupid, stupid, stupid. I can't believe these con artists are getting another movie made about their hucksterism. Wake up, people. The Warrens were awful people who preyed on the hopes of the ignorant and desperate. Oh, also the movie was pretty much like every other horror movie.THE HORROR LOVER: Horror movies are my guilty pleasure. I don't care what the story or budget was, I'll watch it. There are a lot of reasons for this, the primary one being that -- as rare as they are to find -- truly great horror movies can have an effect that lasts much longer than many dramas, comedies or shoot-em-ups. There's a vicarious thrill of survival that comes with an amazing horror film that makes you feel alive and appreciate the fragility of your own mortality. Because of this, I'll watch them all. Every single one.Of course, you can't watch that many horror movies without admitting that 95% of them are just plain awful. Laughable, usually. Maybe 0.09% of them are really great and memorable. The remaining 4.01% are somewhere in the middle, and that's where THE CONJURING falls on the scale.Is the movie well-done? Absolutely. There are strong performances (especially by some of the daughters), great cinematography and camera work, and fairly seamless special effects.Is the movie derivative? You bet. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to think of a single part of the film that is unique. You've got invisible spirits flinging people around. Pictures falling from walls. Creepy kids' voices. Ghosts appearing in flashes in mirrors. Strange bruises. Dogs that refuse to go in the house. A spooky basement. Witches. Corpses floating under water. There's even a creepy doll. For this, I'm afraid it loses major points. If you aren't the horror lover that I am and don't often watch scary films, you'll be suitably scared, I think. But seasoned viewers won't be seeing anything that they won't be able to predict pretty much every step of the way.Even this would warrant 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 if it weren't for a few annoying plot contrivances that really took me out of the film. For instance, the Warrens constantly refer to God (Mrs. Warren is fond of explaining how God brought her and her husband together), but their religious beliefs feel tacked on, shallow, and meaningless. My favorite part? Mr. Warren, fearing for his wife's sanity and safety, suggests that he and her skip this particular spookfest and concentrate their energies on writing a book. Mrs. Warren's response? She scoffs and says with great disdain, ""I don't think God brought us together just to write a book."" Ha ha! Yeah. Since when has God ever wanted people to write a stupid book for Him?This kind of smugness in the characters is sporadic, but when it shows up, it is very distracting. Another example would be the fact that, for some reason, they keep totems from every exorcism and de-haunting in glass cases in their home. You'd think people this religious would, I don't know, swallow their pride and NOT keep previously possessed dolls in the same house they share with their young daughter. I'm no exorcist, though, so maybe that's a thing they do.Finally, I was bothered by the fact that the title of the film really has nothing to do with the story, as well as the fact that the credits show us actual photos of the Warrens and the family from the film, really trying to hammer home that all of this was (based on) REALITY. Considering the subject matter, it's a little unfortunate that they try to Blair-Witch it with the hazy line that exists between truth and fiction, and even more so that -- if this story IS true and the Warrens WERE doing God's work -- I really doubt God brought them together just to make a scary movie. Right, Mrs. Warren?Ha ha. Just kidding. I don't really care.",3,"Based On A True Story About A Horror Movie!!!!

1630083,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00BEIYMAG,,"[3, 6]","Horror movies are a dime a dozen and rarely rise above mediocre. ""The Conjuring"" not only rises above the fray, it places itself amongst the best horror films ever made.Here's the scoop. The Perron Family moves to a new house in rural Rhode Island. They have five daughters and are on a budget. Small, odd things begin to happen in the house. They grow in size and frequency to the point the family knows something is seriously wrong. Much of the odd occurrences seem to center around their daughter Christine. They contact Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) to come and help them out. The Warrens show up, investigate and recommend to the Vatican to do an exorcism. But before that can happen things get so out of hand the warrens must perform the exorcism themselves.This is one scary movie. The structure is classic. Things start slow. All is well as the family tries to reorient themselves with their new surroundings. Small stuff happens and is shrugged off. Said stuff escalates to the point it can no longer be ignored. Now things reach a fever pitch and all hell breaks loose. There are a few things that work here. First is the script. The family is at the center. You meet them. You like them. So when the doo-doo hits the fan you feel for them. You want them to make it out of this in one piece. Then there's the acting. The adults are all veterans and do outstanding jobs in their roles. It's nice seeing Lili Taylor in a high profile role. She's been more of a cult actress over the years. The kids also do a swell job. They feel like family but each has their own face so there is no confusing them. Then there's the direction. I saw James Wan's ""Saw"" and liked it well enough, but that didn't dig nearly as deep as this. He's really honing his craft. There are a few things that succumb to cliche and others that could easily be considered overwrought. There are also a few jumps scares, but they're magnificent jump scares. Overall though he's outdone himself.My guess is (my hope is) this goes down as one of the all time great horror classics.",4,Slow Burn to Fever Pitch,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,2083,"['Horror', 'movies', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'rarely', 'rise', 'mediocre', 'Conjuring', 'not', 'only', 'fray', 'amongst', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'ever', 'scoop', 'Perron', 'Family', 'new', 'house', 'rural', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'have', 'five', 'daughters', 'are', 'budget', 'Small', 'odd', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'house', 'grow', 'size', 'frequency', 'point', 'family', 'something', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'Much', 'odd', 'occurrences', 'seem', 'center', 'around', 'daughter', 'Christine', 'contact', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'come', 'help', 'out', 'Warrens', 'show', 'up', 'investigate', 'recommend', 'Vatican', 'do', 'exorcism', 'can', 'happen', 'things', 'get', 'so', 'hand', 'warrens', 'must', 'perform', 'exorcism', 'themselves.This', 'one', 'scary', 'movie', 'structure', 'classic', 'Things', 'start', 'slow', 'well', 'family', 'reorient', 'new', 'surroundings', 'Small', 'stuff', 'happens', 'shrugged', 'off', 'Said', 'stuff', 'point', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'ignored', 'Now', 'things', 'reach', 'fever', 'pitch', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'work', 'here', 'First', 'script', 'family', 'center', 'meet', 'So', 'when', 'doo-doo', 'hits', 'fan', 'feel', 'want', 'make', 'one', 'piece', 'Then', 'acting', 'adults', 'are', 'veterans', 'do', 'outstanding', 'jobs', 'roles', 'nice', 'seeing', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'high', 'profile', 'role', 'been', 'more', 'cult', 'actress', 'years', 'kids', 'also', 'do', 'swell', 'job', 'feel', 'family', 'own', 'face', 'confusing', 'Then', 'direction', 'saw', 'James', 'Wan', 'Saw', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'dig', 'nearly', 'as', 'deep', 'really', 'honing', 'craft', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'succumb', 'cliche', 'others', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'considered', 'overwrought', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'jumps', 'scares', ""'re"", 'magnificent', 'jump', 'scares', 'Overall', 'outdone', 'himself.My', 'guess', 'hope', 'down', 'one', 'time', 'great', 'horror', 'classics']",N/A

As they say, the story is based on true events.This time paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are hired to help the Perron family who just purchased a fixer upper home in rural Rhode Island.  Roger (Ron Livingston) is a trucker and his wife, Carolyn (Lily Taylor) a stay at home mom with 5 daughters ranging from about 6 to 16.  Before they can even get settled they begin to hear things that go bump in the night.As usual, the events start small.  Smells, rattling pipes, thumping, etc.  Over time, things get more serious including possession.  Wan, to his credit, eschews the gore for character development which includes not only the Perron family but the Warrens who are reluctantly drawn in.  What makes this ghost story more interesting is that it relies less on jump scares and more on constant tension.

You have this film.The only redeeming factors for me were Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor (who hasn't aged hardly at all..fabulous actress)!.  James Wan's direction in this was almost ""homemade"" (i.e. paranormal activity)...and of course the ""world renowned demonologist"" and his famously clairvoyant wife..(really???) were ready, willing and able to do interviews. Charlatans much?  Hubby is absurd with his cross wielding ""onward christian soldier/warrior stance"". (he is a demonologist, but not ridiculous enough to believe in vampires) *snicker*  And the wife, herself would be called a ""soothsayer"" and therefore, according to their own tenet laws in Christianity - a witch herself.So, no, this is not for rational people, because as a reasonable, rational human being you will find horrible flaws that make the story even more difficult to believe (I don't believe it at all), and rational movie watchers want to see things less religious, and closer to ""maybe!"" ..that don't claim to be true.

1630090,A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B00BEIYMAG,,"[3, 9]","When the whole line of movies started, Insidious, Paranormal Activity, and Saw. The producers and directors got together to do many films. Some of which the best include Sinister, Mama, The Possession, The Purge, and The Uninvited. This movie falls short of scares because the basic premise is explained at the very beginning of the film. Which really leaves no room for any sort of mystery, or surprises. The acting is excellent I must say, and the only reason it's rated R is for a few graphic scenes with vomit, slit wrists etc. And it involves children which is also touchy at times. It's not that the movie is horrible, it's just more of the same demonic possession, getting pulled out of bed by your feet, whispering voices type of film we've all become a custom to seeing. I always enjoy films from the makers of the original films, but this one just didn't do anything for me. I think Sinister and Mama are actually much better, and spookier than this. Even though I don't believe in any of it, or scare easily. I actually think what you don't see is much scarier, and loud thumps are much more terrifying. Seeing the lady from The Haunting was a pretty pleasant surprise, as was seeing Patrick Wilson from Insidious.Actually i think the continuous innate screaming at the end of the movie was really what got people afraid in theaters. But it gave me a major headache. So much so that it became annoying, and i was like ok enough already!! So basically I just can't figure out the high ratings of an 86% from critics, and 87% from fans. I thought the other for mentioned movies deserved much higher ratings. Along with others I didn't mention. The only thing much different was the inclusion of the Salem Witch trials. Other than that it's just pretty basic. I also found the birds, exorcism, holy water and crosses to be pretty cliche'.

Oh sure, you see lots of movies with obnoxious characters meeting messy, violent ends, but that is more revolting than horrifying.So ""The Conjuring"" has a strangely timeless, old-school feel to its story -- the entire first half of the movie is devoted to building up the creeping, shadowy feeling that something terrible is lurking just out of sight, followed by a second half of nightmare fuel. That second half is a bit less gripping, but still pretty good vintage horror.Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger Perron (Ron Livingston) move into a rather shabby farmhouse with their five daughters. Almost immediately, strange things start happening -- their dog is killed, birds crash into the house, Carolyn finds inexplicable bruises on her body, and the children are tormented by mysterious things in their bedroom. Then Carolyn is locked in the basement by a ghost.Desperate for help, Carolyn begs paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) to come see her house. They immediately conclude that there is a supernatural force at work here, and that it should be exorcised. But the malevolent forces in the Perron house are working fast, and the Warrens may have to take matters into their own hands to save the family.""The Conjuring""  feels like a much older movie than it actually is -- the slightly faded sepia tone, the lack of sex and gore, the old farmhouse with peeling paint, and the antique furniture wreathed in shadows. And with no initial explanation of just WHAT is haunting the Perron family, you're left wondering what is going on.That sense of mystery is what makes the first half of the movie so intensely spooky -- nothing is seen. Instead, James Wan builds up a slow, creeping sense of horror that seeps into the most innocent of actions, using things that you cannot see -- a nasty smell, a shuffling in the dark, a mysterious bruise,  a tugging on a kid's leg, an unseen specter lurking behind a door.In fact, the second half is less effectively horrific because we actually start SEEING things (people yanked around on wires, ghosts vomiting themselves into someone's mouth). The movie's biggest flaw is that early on, the Warrens declare that ghosts don't possess people... and yet they never mention this declaration when TA-DA! an evil ghost is found. It's a bit confusing.It also has uniformly amazing performances -- Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are amazing as the professional demonologists, believing that this is a God-given duty. But they give some nice nuance to their characters, with Ed's concern over his wife's well-being and Lorraine's serene awareness of the supernatural.And they have equally good performances by Livingston and Taylor, nice ordinary people who find themselves in the grip of something dark and malevolent. And the kids who play their daughters prove that there are excellent child actors out there -- the scene where Joey King tearfully whispers about ""something behind the door"" is enough to make your spine creep.""The Conjuring"" shows a bit too much in its second half, but it doesn't stop this quietly atmospheric movie from being astoundingly creepy -- partly because of what we never see,",5,"""There is something horrible happening in my house.""",1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,3234,"['do', ""n't"", 'see', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'anymore', 'Oh', 'sure', 'see', 'lots', 'movies', 'obnoxious', 'characters', 'meeting', 'messy', 'violent', 'ends', 'more', 'revolting', 'horrifying.So', 'Conjuring', 'strangely', 'timeless', 'old-school', 'feel', 'story', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'devoted', 'building', 'up', 'creeping', 'shadowy', 'feeling', 'something', 'terrible', 'lurking', 'just', 'sight', 'followed', 'second', 'half', 'nightmare', 'fuel', 'second', 'half', 'bit', 'less', 'gripping', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'vintage', 'horror.Carolyn', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Roger', 'Perron', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'move', 'rather', 'shabby', 'farmhouse', 'five', 'daughters', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'dog', 'killed', 'birds', 'crash', 'house', 'Carolyn', 'inexplicable', 'bruises', 'body', 'children', 'are', 'tormented', 'mysterious', 'things', 'bedroom', 'Then', 'Carolyn', 'locked', 'basement', 'ghost.Desperate', 'help', 'Carolyn', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'Ed', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'come', 'see', 'house', 'immediately', 'conclude', 'supernatural', 'force', 'work', 'here', 'should', 'be', 'exorcised', 'malevolent', 'forces', 'Perron', 'house', 'are', 'working', 'fast', 'Warrens', 'may', 'have', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'save', 'family', 'Conjuring', 'feels', 'much', 'older', 'movie', 'actually', 'slightly', 'faded', 'sepia', 'tone', 'lack', 'sex', 'gore', 'old', 'farmhouse', 'peeling', 'paint', 'antique', 'furniture', 'wreathed', 'shadows', 'initial', 'explanation', 'just', 'WHAT', 'haunting', 'Perron', 'family', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'sense', 'mystery', 'what', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'so', 'intensely', 'spooky', 'nothing', 'seen', 'Instead', 'James', 'Wan', 'up', 'slow', 'creeping', 'sense', 'horror', 'most', 'innocent', 'actions', 'using', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'nasty', 'smell', 'shuffling', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'bruise', 'tugging', 'kid', 'leg', 'unseen', 'specter', 'lurking', 'door.In', 'fact', 'second', 'half', 'less', 'effectively', 'horrific', 'actually', 'start', 'SEEING', 'things', 'people', 'yanked', 'wires', 'ghosts', 'vomiting', 'someone', 'mouth', 'movie', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'early', 'Warrens', 'declare', 'ghosts', 'do', ""n't"", 'possess', 'people', 'yet', 'never', 'mention', 'declaration', 'when', 'TA-DA', 'evil', 'ghost', 'found', 'bit', 'confusing.It', 'also', 'uniformly', 'amazing', 'performances', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'are', 'amazing', 'professional', 'demonologists', 'believing', 'God-given', 'duty', 'give', 'nice', 'nuance', 'characters', 'Ed', 'concern', 'wife', 'well-being', 'Lorraine', 'serene', 'awareness', 'supernatural.And', 'have', 'equally', 'good', 'performances', 'Livingston', 'Taylor', 'nice', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'grip', 'something', 'dark', 'malevolent', 'kids', 'who', 'play', 'daughters', 'prove', 'are', 'excellent', 'child', 'actors', 'out', 'there', 'scene', 'where', 'Joey', 'King', 'tearfully', 'something', 'door', 'enough', 'make', 'spine', 'creep', 'Conjuring', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'second', 'half', ""n't"", 'stop', 'quietly', 'atmospheric', 'movie', 'being', 'astoundingly', 'creepy', 'partly', 'what', 'never', 'see']",N/A

1630096,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B00BEIYMAG,,"[4, 9]","What better way to do this than to give my thoughts on a horror movie that is being hailed as terrifying and a true scare. Here is my take on The Conjuring.I have seen my fair share of horror movies; but the only one in recent memory that i actually consider to be scary is Sinister. However for the next few nights, i will be sleeping with a bible close to my bed. SERIOUSLY. For a movie of its genre, The Conjuring is VERY creepy and while it may not scare some of you right away, the thought of this movie increases its scare factor tremendously.The Conjuring stars a relatively well-rounded cast that consists of: Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor, Ron Livingston, Joey King and the adorable Mackenzie Foy(who played Renesmee in Breaking Dawn Pt. 2). Without giving away the character names or any major details on the characters, I gotta say this: This movie has some REALLY good acting. The moments where these actors are scared; you feel scared right along with them.I will not say if i do or don't believe in demonic possession, but I have to say............The Conjuring makes you not want to say you don't believe in it. The Conjuring is set in the 1970s, and is based upon demonic possession.To describe it, its like The Exorcism(which scared some, some it didnt), the ex tv show Ghost Whisperer, and the movie Paranormal Activity (with a relatively higher IQ) all in one. And while there there a lot of unusual and admittedly scary occurences in The Conjuring, I will also say this movie does involve a doll; and unlike Charles Lee Ray ""chucky""....... this doll literally looks like it went to the very pits of hell and had a good time.I will be buying this movie when it releases on dvd, and even though I am skeptical about the rumored sequel, I rate this movie:9/10Thanks again to everyone who reads my reviews.

They seek the help of Ed and Lorraine Warren, so called demonologist specializing in ghosts and spiritual activities.Review: For weeks I have been so obsessed about this movie that I actually read plenty of reviews and watched interviews, which built up my expectations too high I guess. Judging by what everyone else has said, I was expecting to be at the edge of my seat, biting on my finger nails, occasionally covering my eyes, maybe even scream out loud. But that was not the case. Nonetheless I did enjoy The Conjuring, because it doesn't rely on over-the top gore effects or people jumping out of a dark corner, as a matter of fact certain scenes actually make your heart beat faster just because you think something is going to happen, and then... nothing. But then you don't expect it, and it happens. The cast was terrific. Vera Fermiga is a very charismatic actress, I would almost say like a young Meryl Streep, and she brought life into this movie, but so did Patrick Wilson. And let's not forget about Lily Taylor, who definitely needs more roles.If you have seen Insidious you will definitely find similarities as far as the shock moments go. James Wan is a great director, who knows how to create an atmospheric horror thriller with great cinematography. His secret is to use his own fears to create the mood of the movie (see interview below).Rating: 3.5/5To see the more reviews please VISIT my blog [...] LIKE my Facebook page [...] and FOLLOW me on Twitter:  @SimonSays_Watch",4,It's scary because it actually happened!,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,1789,"['might', 'like', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'Amityville', 'Horror', '1979/2005', 'Shining', '1980', 'Insidious', '2010', 'Long', 'Story', 'Short', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'get', 'know', 'Perron', 'Family', 'new', 'home', 'experiences', 'horrific', 'events', 'due', 'spirits', 'living', 'house', 'seek', 'help', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'so', 'called', 'demonologist', 'specializing', 'ghosts', 'spiritual', 'activities.Review', 'weeks', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'obsessed', 'movie', 'actually', 'read', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'watched', 'interviews', 'built', 'up', 'expectations', 'too', 'high', 'guess', 'Judging', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'said', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'edge', 'seat', 'biting', 'finger', 'nails', 'occasionally', 'covering', 'eyes', 'maybe', 'even', 'scream', 'out', 'loud', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Conjuring', ""n't"", 'rely', 'over-the', 'top', 'gore', 'effects', 'people', 'jumping', 'dark', 'corner', 'matter', 'fact', 'certain', 'scenes', 'actually', 'make', 'heart', 'beat', 'faster', 'just', 'think', 'something', 'going', 'happen', 'then', 'nothing', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'cast', 'was', 'terrific', 'Vera', 'Fermiga', 'very', 'charismatic', 'actress', 'would', 'almost', 'say', 'young', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'brought', 'life', 'movie', 'so', 'did', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Lily', 'Taylor', 'who', 'definitely', 'more', 'roles.If', 'have', 'seen', 'Insidious', 'will', 'definitely', 'find', 'similarities', 'as', 'far', 'shock', 'moments', 'go', 'James', 'Wan', 'great', 'director', 'who', 'how', 'create', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'thriller', 'great', 'cinematography', 'secret', 'use', 'own', 'fears', 'create', 'mood', 'movie', 'see', 'interview', '.Rating', '3.5/5To', 'see', 'more', 'reviews', 'please', 'VISIT', 'blog', '[', ']', 'Facebook', 'page', '[', ']', 'FOLLOW', 'Twitter', '@', 'SimonSays_Watch']",N/A
1630100,AJRZ98VIOES0U,B00BEIYMAG,,"[5, 8]","The Conjuring came out of nowhere from horror-noir director James Wan. It takes the best of Paranormal Activity, Insidious, Sinister, and Dark Skies, and crams it into a 2-hour long roller coaster ride from hell. A nostalgic throwback story, incredible acting, heart-pounding sound effects, and beautiful cinematography make The Conjuring one the best made horror movies I have ever seen. James Wan dowses this movie with a thick fog of atmosphere and layers on the escalating bass notes when the action peaks. One after another, the scares keep coming like roaring train cars, hurdling along the rails at breakneck speed.Ed and Lorraine Warren are the movie's protagonists. The couple is based on their real-life counterparts, whose paranormal research came into the national spotlight after the infamous Amityville House case. Both actors who play the pair (Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga), look as if they have been plucked from the 70's with their retro outfits, folksy manners, and believable reactions to ongoing events. The beautiful Rhode Island home that is the movie's primary set piece is so overflowing with spectral activity and gothic stylings that it should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor during the 2013 Oscars. It's curse is far-reaching to the point that the Warrens own daughter Judy is attacked by the evil entity in their family home, many miles away from the possessed farmhouse.The family in peril is the Perrons. Roger and Carolyn have five daughters between themselves. Joey King, who plays the curly blond sister, stands out above the rest with her startling performance. The fear ricochets off each daughter and infects the parents, who are forced to seek the Warrens assistance out of sheer terror. Ed and Lorraine set up shop at their country estate, and discover that an evil entity has latched onto the family. Ed is no man of the cloth, and contacts a Catholic Priest to perform an Exorcism. The dumbfounded Clergyman ogles Ed's videotaped evidence, lets out a deep exhale, and informs Ed that the green light would have to come from the Vatican itself. With time running out, Ed takes the demon on mano-a-mano.Months after The Conjuring's theatrical run, James Wan followed up with the lackluster sequel to Insidious. It seems as if he used all of his good ideas on the former, while the latter's rushed feel could have been the result of pressure from studio executives. James Wan recently issued a public statement proclaiming that he would no longer direct movies in the horror genre, and instead wants to focus on other types of films. This is no surprise as this movie is Wan's magnum opus, and cannot be outdone utilizing the director's current idea bank. The Conjuring goes down as the scariest movie since The Exorcist.",5,GREATEST Horror Movie of The Decade!,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,2767,"['Conjuring', 'came', 'nowhere', 'horror-noir', 'director', 'James', 'Wan', 'best', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Insidious', 'Sinister', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'crams', '2-hour', 'long', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'hell', 'nostalgic', 'throwback', 'story', 'incredible', 'acting', 'heart-pounding', 'sound', 'effects', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'make', 'Conjuring', 'one', 'best', 'made', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'James', 'Wan', 'movie', 'thick', 'fog', 'atmosphere', 'layers', 'escalating', 'bass', 'notes', 'when', 'action', 'peaks', 'One', 'scares', 'keep', 'coming', 'roaring', 'train', 'cars', 'hurdling', 'rails', 'breakneck', 'speed.Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'are', 'movie', 'protagonists', 'couple', 'based', 'real-life', 'counterparts', 'paranormal', 'research', 'came', 'national', 'spotlight', 'infamous', 'Amityville', 'House', 'case', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'pair', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'look', 'have', 'been', 'plucked', '70', 'retro', 'outfits', 'folksy', 'manners', 'believable', 'reactions', 'ongoing', 'events', 'beautiful', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'home', 'movie', 'primary', 'set', 'piece', 'so', 'overflowing', 'spectral', 'activity', 'gothic', 'stylings', 'should', 'be', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', '2013', 'Oscars', 'curse', 'far-reaching', 'point', 'Warrens', 'own', 'daughter', 'Judy', 'attacked', 'evil', 'entity', 'family', 'home', 'many', 'miles', 'away', 'possessed', 'farmhouse.The', 'family', 'peril', 'Perrons', 'Roger', 'Carolyn', 'have', 'five', 'daughters', 'Joey', 'King', 'who', 'curly', 'blond', 'sister', 'out', 'rest', 'startling', 'performance', 'fear', 'ricochets', 'daughter', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'seek', 'Warrens', 'assistance', 'sheer', 'terror', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'country', 'estate', 'discover', 'evil', 'entity', 'latched', 'family', 'Ed', 'man', 'cloth', 'Catholic', 'Priest', 'perform', 'Exorcism', 'dumbfounded', 'Clergyman', 'Ed', 'videotaped', 'evidence', 'out', 'deep', 'exhale', 'informs', 'Ed', 'green', 'light', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'Vatican', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'Ed', 'demon', 'mano-a-mano.Months', 'Conjuring', 'theatrical', 'run', 'James', 'Wan', 'followed', 'up', 'lackluster', 'sequel', 'Insidious', 'used', 'good', 'ideas', 'former', 'latter', 'rushed', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'result', 'pressure', 'studio', 'executives', 'James', 'Wan', 'recently', 'issued', 'public', 'statement', 'proclaiming', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'direct', 'movies', 'horror', 'genre', 'instead', 'focus', 'other', 'types', 'films', 'surprise', 'movie', 'Wan', 'magnum', 'opus', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'outdone', 'utilizing', 'director', 'current', 'idea', 'bank', 'Conjuring', 'down', 'scariest', 'movie', 'Exorcist']",N/A
1630101,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B00BEIYMAG,,"[6, 10]","I'm wondering if it is possible to un-see a movie...JUST JOKING!First of all, Anyone who claims that this movie did not scare them...is LYING! I will call them a liar to their faces because it is indeed scary. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone pregnant (my sister is almost 9 months and I told her not to go), or anyone who has a heart condition. Secondly, this movie is not for children unless you want them sleeping in your bed for the rest of their lives. I realize some people may think that I am exaggerating, but when I went to go see it, this movie had 300lb grown men leaving ""going to the bathroom."" I lie to you not people, this movie is a complete nightmare. Forget about every scary movie that you've seen in the 21st century because they won't even come close to this. Saw was gory (not scary) and Insidious moves really slow, and it doesn't pick up to me until about 45 minutes into the movie, but when it did I liked it even though a lot of people didn't. The Paranormal Activity Movies were creepy, but not scary, and frankly they moved really slowly too in my opinion.Third, this movie doesn't play around; it jumps right into the scares from the very beginning, so you will not be bored or disappointed I promise you. I expected a regular horror movie, nothing really special, and I felt like the trailers were just snippets of the best parts of the movie, but the movie itself was probably going to be mediocre at best. I was WRONG! Those screams are real. When I left the theater, I felt like I needed to recite the LORD'S PRAYER and SEVERAL HAIL MARY'S! I do not scare easily, but this movie not only scared the crap out of me, and I swear I started having heart palpitations right there in the theater. This movie is not about a regular haunted house, possession, or any of the other vastly overused plots they use now days. There is something for everyone, and it plays on your worst fears.1. Scared of the dark...check!2. Scared of enclosed spaces...check!3. Scared of ghosts, spirits, and demons...check!4. Scared of the things that go bump in the night...check!5. Scared of any harm coming to your children...check!6. Scared of being trapped with nowhere else to go...check!7. Scared of creepy dolls and cursed objects...check!8. Scared of things jumping out at you; right in your face...check!9. Scared of old haunted houses...check!10. Scared of Satan worship, human sacrifice, and witches...check!11. Scared of demonic possession or becoming a prisoner in your own body...check!12. Scared of the basement...check!I really can't say what parts of this movie are true, and what parts were embellished in order to make a great movie, but whatever the case I have a newfound respect for Ed and Lorraine Warren. I was already familiar with some of their work because I used to watch the T.V. show ""A Haunting"" faithfully, and they were on quite a bit of those episodes, and I knew they also investigated the Amityville Horror. With that said, this was the worst, and I can see why they kept it hidden all these years. That family was lucky to have them. I really don't want to weigh my review down with a whole lot of the plot which ruins the entire experience, so all I have left to say is....watch at your own risk!Lastly, I really have to add this because I read where some people thought certain scenes were ""cheesy"" but it was those so-called ""cheesy"" moments that made the movie even better to me. It's no secret that the demons want to destroy a strong family by using the divide and conquer method to tear apart their unity. Once the vessel that the entity seeks to inhabit becomes so isolated, and broken down, it makes the possession that much easier. There are few mothers and fathers who won't fight practically anything or anybody for their children, and they had 5, so they had to be 5 times as strong to face that evil. The same thing with the Warrens, a husband and wife unit is a powerful thing. They both needed to be there to support one another, and if it's so easy for one partner to abandon the other in their darkest hours. What does that say about their faith, strength, and unity as a couple? Lorraine did the right thing by standing at her husband's side no matter what. I realize those concepts may seem foreign and outdated to some, but those types of relationships still exist in the world. This demon was relentless, and had even started stalking the Warrens' daughter for that matter. They had to finish what they started, or should I say got themselves involved in. Allowing the characters to remember those cherished moments it's what ultimately saves all of them in the end. I thought those parts were lovely.",5,Warning: Watch at your own risk!,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,4668,"[""'m"", 'wondering', 'possible', 'un-see', 'movie', 'JUST', 'JOKING', 'First', 'Anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'scare', 'LYING', 'will', 'call', 'liar', 'indeed', 'scary', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'pregnant', 'sister', 'almost', '9', 'months', 'told', 'not', 'go', 'anyone', 'who', 'heart', 'condition', 'Secondly', 'movie', 'not', 'children', 'want', 'sleeping', 'bed', 'rest', 'lives', 'realize', 'people', 'may', 'think', 'am', 'exaggerating', 'when', 'went', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'had', '300lb', 'grown', 'men', 'leaving', 'going', 'bathroom', 'lie', 'not', 'people', 'movie', 'complete', 'nightmare', 'Forget', 'scary', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', '21st', 'century', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Saw', 'was', 'gory', 'not', 'scary', 'Insidious', 'moves', 'really', 'slow', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', '45', 'minutes', 'movie', 'when', 'did', 'liked', 'even', 'lot', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Movies', 'were', 'creepy', 'not', 'scary', 'frankly', 'moved', 'really', 'slowly', 'too', 'opinion.Third', 'movie', ""n't"", 'play', 'around', 'right', 'scares', 'very', 'beginning', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'bored', 'disappointed', 'promise', 'expected', 'regular', 'horror', 'movie', 'nothing', 'really', 'special', 'felt', 'trailers', 'were', 'just', 'snippets', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'mediocre', 'best', 'was', 'WRONG', 'screams', 'are', 'real', 'When', 'left', 'theater', 'felt', 'needed', 'recite', 'LORD', 'PRAYER', 'SEVERAL', 'HAIL', 'MARY', 'do', 'not', 'scare', 'easily', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'scared', 'crap', 'swear', 'started', 'having', 'heart', 'palpitations', 'right', 'there', 'theater', 'movie', 'not', 'regular', 'haunted', 'house', 'possession', 'other', 'vastly', 'overused', 'plots', 'use', 'now', 'days', 'something', 'everyone', 'worst', 'fears.1', 'Scared', 'dark', 'check', '2', 'Scared', 'enclosed', 'spaces', 'check', '3', 'Scared', 'ghosts', 'spirits', 'demons', 'check', '4', 'Scared', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'check', '5', 'Scared', 'harm', 'coming', 'children', 'check', '6', 'Scared', 'being', 'trapped', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', 'check', '7', 'Scared', 'creepy', 'dolls', 'cursed', 'objects', 'check', '8', 'Scared', 'things', 'jumping', 'out', 'right', 'face', 'check', '9', 'Scared', 'old', 'haunted', 'houses', 'check', '10', 'Scared', 'Satan', 'worship', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'witches', 'check', '11', 'Scared', 'demonic', 'possession', 'becoming', 'prisoner', 'own', 'body', 'check', '12', 'Scared', 'basement', 'check', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'true', 'what', 'parts', 'were', 'embellished', 'order', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'case', 'have', 'newfound', 'respect', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'work', 'used', 'watch', 'T.V', 'show', 'Haunting', 'faithfully', 'were', 'quite', 'bit', 'episodes', 'knew', 'also', 'investigated', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'said', 'was', 'worst', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'kept', 'years', 'family', 'was', 'lucky', 'have', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'weigh', 'review', 'down', 'whole', 'lot', 'plot', 'entire', 'experience', 'have', 'left', 'say', '.watch', 'own', 'risk', 'Lastly', 'really', 'have', 'add', 'read', 'where', 'people', 'thought', 'certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'cheesy', 'was', 'so-called', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'made', 'movie', 'even', 'better', 'secret', 'demons', 'want', 'destroy', 'strong', 'family', 'using', 'divide', 'conquer', 'method', 'tear', 'apart', 'unity', 'vessel', 'entity', 'inhabit', 'becomes', 'so', 'isolated', 'broken', 'down', 'possession', 'much', 'easier', 'are', 'few', 'mothers', 'fathers', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fight', 'practically', 'anything', 'anybody', 'children', 'had', '5', 'had', 'be', '5', 'times', 'strong', 'face', 'evil', 'same', 'thing', 'Warrens', 'husband', 'wife', 'unit', 'powerful', 'thing', 'needed', 'be', 'there', 'support', 'one', 'so', 'easy', 'one', 'partner', 'abandon', 'other', 'darkest', 'hours', 'What', 'say', 'faith', 'strength', 'unity', 'couple', 'Lorraine', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'standing', 'husband', 'side', 'no', 'matter', 'what', 'realize', 'concepts', 'may', 'seem', 'foreign', 'outdated', 'types', 'relationships', 'still', 'exist', 'world', 'demon', 'was', 'relentless', 'had', 'even', 'started', 'stalking', 'Warrens', 'daughter', 'matter', 'had', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'should', 'say', 'got', 'involved', 'Allowing', 'characters', 'remember', 'cherished', 'moments', 'what', 'ultimately', 'end', 'thought', 'parts', 'were', 'lovely']",N/A
1630102,A2CT3GSDKWME0B,B00BEIYMAG,,"[6, 13]","I saw this movie opening night on July 19th 2013 - - and for the most part, I thought it was pretty good actually.  ""Horror movies"", in general, have always seemed to have been the toughest flicks to make - - and really good horror movies are so few and far that it's not even funny !So are movies that are made that involve children, and child acting - - those can also be very challenging to make as well. But overall, I think the children in this movie do a great job with in their roles.THE POSITIVES:  This movie had tenseness throughtout, and the fright moments seemed to build slowly but steadily.  The movie had many great ""things that go bump"" sounds and moments (I especially liked the hand clap game)throughout the movie that amounted to great lead-in's for the climax of the bizarre exorcism (Linda Blair would have puked and chucked green vomit with a devilish smile seeing this, and would have been proud of this scene - as a nice job was done here !)  Nice ""creeky old house"" with classic squeeky doors throughout.  And every creepy haunted house needs the youngest daughter and the creepy paranormal entity to have a wonderful working ""new best friends"" relationship with one another. And this one worked well.  The guy who played the cop was neurotically good - - playing a classic country bumpkin and comedic ""Billy-Bob lawdog"" !THE NEGATIVES:  I found both leading women (Vera Farmiga and Lily Taylor) a bit ""over-the-top"" in their roles - Vera with her paranormal husband, and Lily with her husband and family.

1630103,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B00BEIYMAG,,"[6, 14]","""The Conjuring"" did scare me, but twenty minutes after I left the theater, I'd momentarily forgotten that I'd just seen it. While I was watching it I got a little bored and some scenes tempted me to laugh. If you've seen 1963's ""The Haunting,"" 1973's ""The Exorcist"" and 1944's ""The Uninvited"" you've seen three much better films from which ""The Conjuring"" gets its bag of tricks.Probably any clever film student could make something like this movie. We all know the basic ingredients: a large, old house in an isolated setting. The house should be attractive but something about it makes it ugly. It's in New England. It's autumn: cold winds blow skittering dead leaves. An innocent family moves into the house. The family is generic, without too many details; they are All-American and the audience can identify with them. They do normal things like go to the beach and watch ""The Brady Bunch.""Their new home contains many dark and dusty nooks and crannies. There are antique curios that look a bit menacing.Suddenly, during a quiet night, a strange noise is heard. For some reason, no one in this family ever switches on normal lighting. Rather, they use weak flashlights or match flames.An innocent child arises from bed in a long white nightgown. She moves slowly, slowly, slowly, down a dark hall to investigate the noise. The scene is very quiet, very long, and very repetitive. You know that eventually the innocent child is going to come across something unusual: a vision of a hanged person, the reflection of a ghost in a mirror, or something truly terrifying, an IRS man there to conduct an audit.You know that at the same moment that the defenseless family member sees the unusual thing, the previously silent scene will burst with sudden, loud, and oppressive noise. The sudden vision and noise will startle you, and you will be scared. What you paid the ticket price for. Oh, and the family dog dies, birds act weird, and mom is bruising easily.At first, of course, everyone in the house writes off these events as mere chance. Everyone is rational and is not tempted to believe in the supernatural. Eventually someone in the family levitates or clocks stop or people feel cold or something. Just like in ""The Haunting,"" there are loud banging noises. Just as in ""The Uninvited,"" a family member is possessed by the dark energies of the house, and there is the ghost of a bad mother and a not-so-bad mother. Just as in ""The Exorcist,"" there will be an exorcism.So the team of experts is brought in. They speak some ancient language like Latin and possess arcane knowledge. I won't tell you any more because that would reveal the end of the movie to you, but I bet you can guess.I'll just say that at one point, the satanic shenanigans in the house reach fever pitch. Satan is beating the stuffing out of these poor fools. Any sane person would immediately evacuate. At that point a paranormal investigator, Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) says, ""Leaving the house won't help because the dark spirits have attached themselves to you."" OH COME ON. Vera Farmiga may as well have said, ""You can't leave now because there's still forty-five minutes to go in the movie.""Vera Farmiga is a scintillating actress. She electrifies every scene she is in. Patrick Wilson is perfect as her husband; they have great chemistry. The movie wastes them, though. The filmmakers don't seem to realize that Farmiga's human depth and complexity are the best thing the movie has going for it, and utilizing that human power would have made their film a classic, rather than just another ""Boo!"" movie.""The Excorsist,"" ""The Haunting"" and ""The Uninvited"" are all scary but they are also deep. They present big themes. ""The Conjuring"" avoids big themes. One character tries to kill another, and it's the kind of killing that makes your skin crawl. The movie makes no attempt to plumb these murky waters.""The Conjuring"" misrepresents evil and Catholicism. When the Warrens arrive at the haunted house, Lorraine has a rosary strung from her wrist. Ed Warren places little wooden crucifixes around the house. In the exorcism scene, Latin is spoken. This isn't true spirituality; it's fetishism - the belief that objects and rituals possess supernatural power. They do not. Only God has power. I am a Catholic, I pray the rosary, and I believe in Satan. The force that defies Satan is not an object, a rosary, it is rather faith in God.The Haunting[[ASIN:B00DZP1C8Q[[ASIN:B00DZP1C8Q The Uninvited (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]]",3,"""The Conjuring"" = ""The Haunting"" + ""The Exorcist"" - 20 IQ Points",1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,4513,"['Conjuring', 'did', 'scare', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'left', 'theater', ""'d"", 'momentarily', 'forgotten', ""'d"", 'just', 'seen', 'was', 'watching', 'got', 'little', 'bored', 'scenes', 'tempted', 'laugh', ""'ve"", 'seen', '1963', 'Haunting', '1973', 'Exorcist', '1944', 'Uninvited', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'three', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'Conjuring', 'bag', 'tricks.Probably', 'clever', 'film', 'student', 'could', 'make', 'something', 'movie', 'know', 'basic', 'ingredients', 'large', 'old', 'house', 'isolated', 'setting', 'house', 'should', 'be', 'attractive', 'something', 'ugly', 'New', 'England', 'autumn', 'cold', 'winds', 'skittering', 'dead', 'leaves', 'innocent', 'family', 'moves', 'house', 'family', 'generic', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'are', 'All-American', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'do', 'normal', 'things', 'go', 'beach', 'watch', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'new', 'home', 'contains', 'many', 'dark', 'dusty', 'nooks', 'crannies', 'are', 'antique', 'curios', 'look', 'bit', 'menacing.Suddenly', 'quiet', 'night', 'strange', 'noise', 'heard', 'reason', 'one', 'family', 'ever', 'normal', 'lighting', 'use', 'weak', 'flashlights', 'match', 'flames.An', 'innocent', 'child', 'arises', 'bed', 'long', 'white', 'nightgown', 'slowly', 'slowly', 'slowly', 'down', 'dark', 'hall', 'investigate', 'noise', 'scene', 'very', 'quiet', 'very', 'long', 'very', 'repetitive', 'know', 'eventually', 'innocent', 'child', 'going', 'come', 'something', 'unusual', 'vision', 'hanged', 'person', 'reflection', 'ghost', 'mirror', 'something', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'IRS', 'man', 'there', 'conduct', 'audit.You', 'know', 'same', 'moment', 'defenseless', 'family', 'member', 'unusual', 'thing', 'previously', 'silent', 'scene', 'will', 'burst', 'sudden', 'loud', 'oppressive', 'noise', 'sudden', 'vision', 'noise', 'will', 'startle', 'will', 'be', 'scared', 'What', 'paid', 'ticket', 'price', 'Oh', 'family', 'dog', 'dies', 'birds', 'act', 'weird', 'mom', 'bruising', 'easily.At', 'first', 'course', 'everyone', 'house', 'events', 'mere', 'chance', 'Everyone', 'rational', 'not', 'tempted', 'believe', 'supernatural', 'Eventually', 'someone', 'family', 'clocks', 'stop', 'people', 'feel', 'cold', 'something', 'Just', 'Haunting', 'are', 'loud', 'banging', 'noises', 'Just', 'Uninvited', 'family', 'member', 'possessed', 'dark', 'energies', 'house', 'ghost', 'bad', 'mother', 'not-so-bad', 'mother', 'Just', 'Exorcist', 'will', 'be', 'exorcism.So', 'team', 'experts', 'brought', 'speak', 'ancient', 'language', 'Latin', 'possess', 'arcane', 'knowledge', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'reveal', 'end', 'movie', 'bet', 'can', 'guess.I', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'one', 'point', 'satanic', 'shenanigans', 'house', 'reach', 'fever', 'pitch', 'Satan', 'beating', 'stuffing', 'poor', 'fools', 'sane', 'person', 'would', 'immediately', 'evacuate', 'point', 'paranormal', 'investigator', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Leaving', 'house', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'dark', 'spirits', 'have', 'attached', 'OH', 'COME', 'ON', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'now', 'still', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'go', 'movie', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'scintillating', 'actress', 'scene', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'perfect', 'husband', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'though', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'Farmiga', 'human', 'depth', 'complexity', 'are', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'going', 'utilizing', 'human', 'power', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'classic', 'rather', 'just', 'Boo', 'movie', 'Excorsist', 'Haunting', 'Uninvited', 'are', 'scary', 'are', 'also', 'deep', 'present', 'big', 'themes', 'Conjuring', 'big', 'themes', 'One', 'character', 'kill', 'kind', 'killing', 'skin', 'crawl', 'movie', 'attempt', 'plumb', 'murky', 'waters', 'Conjuring', 'misrepresents', 'evil', 'Catholicism', 'When', 'Warrens', 'arrive', 'haunted', 'house', 'Lorraine', 'rosary', 'strung', 'wrist', 'Ed', 'Warren', 'little', 'wooden', 'crucifixes', 'house', 'exorcism', 'scene', 'Latin', 'spoken', ""n't"", 'true', 'spirituality', 'fetishism', 'belief', 'rituals', 'possess', 'supernatural', 'power', 'do', 'not', 'Only', 'God', 'power', 'am', 'Catholic', 'pray', 'rosary', 'believe', 'Satan', 'force', 'Satan', 'not', 'object', 'rosary', 'rather', 'faith', 'God.The', 'Haunting', '[', '[', 'ASIN', 'B00DZP1C8Q', '[', '[', 'ASIN', 'B00DZP1C8Q', 'Uninvited', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', ']', ']']",N/A

I wanted to really like the film, but found myself merely liking it. The problem for me is too many parallels to other horror films of the past half century: The shrouded chair-bound body in the basement with a bare light bulb swinging overhead is classic Hitchcock, as are the scenes of birds flying pell mell into the side of the house, threatening the humans within. Electronic surveillance of supernatural activity in targeted rooms has been skillfully implemented in the recent films of Oren Peli. Loud, thundering pounding on doors and walls was the trademark of 1963's the Haunting. The theme of female demonic malevolence has most recently been well-realized by ""The Woman in Black"", portrayed by Liz White. And demonic possession itself, with a barfing, bruised, baleful female victim was filmed to chilling perfection forty years ago by Friedkin, based on Blatty's novel.Director Wan has created a well-crafted synthesis of many of the best elements of paranormal possession films of the past fifty years. He is skillful in the timing of classic ""cardiac jump moments"", when a monster pops out from behind a door, in a mirror, or leaps from overhead. His camera angles are interesting and inventive, with some dizzying inverted moments.The movie is worth seeing.

1630106,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BEIYMAG,,"[7, 12]","""Insidious"" made over $54 million domestically on a $1.5 million budget and became the highest grossing film of 2011. Director James Wan knows how to be thrifty with his filmmaking that isn't time consuming yet still pays off for the audience. However, with ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" coming out this September and Wan being announced as the director taking over ""Fast & Furious 7"" with a July 11, 2014 release, people may be a little sick of the director in the coming months. ""The Conjuring"" should be on your radar though, especially when early buzz for the film was so positive Warner Bros bumped the film from its original early 2013 release to the middle of the summer blockbuster season. While ""The Conjuring"" may not be the terrifying masterpiece the promo material is making it out to be, it's still an incredibly atmospheric and tense experience.The film begins with the Warrens investigating a possessed doll moving around on its own. It's revealed that the doll is the vessel for an inhuman spirit, which is actually quite demonic. The opening credits then slowly crawl across the screen; simple yellow text that scrolls up on a black background yet somehow still feels ominous. You then witness the Perrons move into the farmhouse and their financial woes slowly bubble to the surface. The supernatural occurrences take the snowball effect and start off small before increasing in size and strength. Little things are introduced like the dog not wanting to go inside, cobwebs, the house always being cold, and the clocks stopping at 3:07am. The film's minimal use of music only adds to the tension. The events begin to escalate with legs being pulled during sleep, house creaks, footsteps, doors banging lightly on their own repeatedly, and sleepwalking. Things are taken a step further with the hide and clap game, which you've probably seen from the trailer, doors slamming shut on their own, and the bruises appearing on Carolyn's body.""The Conjuring"" doesn't rush anything, which is one of its strengths. The first hour lays the foundation for its second half. It has to take the time to fully sculpt its scares, which it does beautifully. The intense exorcism in the second hour is the film's big pay off and feels like its pride and joy. It is without question the most terrifying scene in the film.At the same time, many may feel like the film is too slow at first. The little things obviously build to larger and more gratifying sequences later on, but it could be seen as a bit too meticulous for its own good for some. Ed seems a bit too protective for Lorraine at times. The film does a good job of laying out why, but Ed and Lorraine having the discussion every time they have a moment to themselves is a bit much. ""The Conjuring"" may also take things a little overboard in its final act, especially when you take into consideration that's it's supposed to be based on a true story. Lastly, Ron Livingston is horrible and seems out of place in the horror genre. Near the end of the film, he's asked to verbally console his wife and his line delivery is way too stiff and rigid to sound like a caring husband.""The Conjuring"" establishes a thick, rich, and terrifying atmosphere that is sure to leave audiences biting their nails and choking back screams.

1630108,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYMAG,,"[8, 12]","From time to time, it's nice to indulge in a good horror flick.  This is a genre that's seen its fair share of ups and downs over the years, but the evolution of horror movies themselves is an interesting story.  At one point, Frankenstein and Dracula were the scariest guys on the block, but eventually had to make room for zombies and werewolves.  Then, Alfred Hitchcock came along with his own set of foes, including The Birds and an innocent looking motel owner, named Norman Bates.  Psycho kick-started the ""slasher"" sub-genre, which eventually led to the creation of iconic villains, such as Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Freddie Krueger.  After a period of constant sequels and cheap knock-offs in the 1980s, slasher films turned into more a joke than anything else.  However, horror found new life in hits like Scream, The Blair Witch Project, and The Ring - which has evolved into the horror genre we see today.  Now, it's no longer about the bad guys trying to get the babysitter.  It's about the innocent families at home and the pesky evil spirits that are trying to ""get"" them.  Films like Paranormal Activity, Dark Skies, and Mama have fascinated audiences, so it's no surprise the newest horror/suspense film, The Conjuring, is also enjoying early success.Directed by James Wan (Saw, Insidious), The Conjuring tells the true story of the 1971 events at a farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island.  Roger Perron (Ron Livingston), along with his wife, Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and their five daughters, recently moved into a new farmhouse.  Suddenly, strange events begin taking place at night, leading the family to contact a married couple that specializes in supernatural occurrences.  For years, Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his wife, Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), have dealt with mystical dark forces and believe they can assist the Perron family with riding the evil that has taken a grip on the innocent-looking farmhouse.  Mackenzie Foy, Joey King, Hayley McFarland, Shanley Caswell, and Kyla Deaver also star in supporting roles.There's very little not to love about this film.  From beginning to end and from top to bottom, The Conjuring is one of the best horror flicks in quite some time - and the praise should go squarely to the masterful cast.  It's not uncommon for horror films to flourish without well-known star power, and The Conjuring is no exception.  Sure, there are plenty of recognizable faces in the film, but it's much more likely that you'll be wondering where you've seen them before instead of being able to recite their previous roles.  Regardless, the entire cast leaves little room for criticism, spreading the workload relatively evenly and often becoming so involved with their roles that occasionally you'll forget it's still a movie.  These relatively unknown players bring their A-game and provide for an absolutely superb viewing experience.The Conjuring is actually based on real life events in which Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated a farmhouse.  In case you've never heard of the Warrens, they are most well-known for their involvement with the Lutz family during The Amityville Horror case in the mid-1970s.  Regardless, The Conjuring's plot feels like it could have easily been called The Exorcist, or at least a clever prequel in some way shape or form.  Although the plot of The Conjuring has very little in common with the plot of The Exorcist, it's hard not to mention the similar subject matters - especially since The Exorcist is regarded by many as one of the greatest horror films ever made.  Like The Exorcist, The Conjuring also plays heavily on the theme of good vs. evil and the vulnerability individuals create for themselves if they aren't overly religious - even though it's hard to imagine a religious family fending off the evil spirits in this film.Going with the same theme as Evil Dead and Mama, the house is a creepy place to be at night.  Why not play off something so simply when it works so well?  The Conjuring does a marvelous job of using one specific setting to feast on the fears of viewers and it does so in such a clean, well-constructed manner.  The film appears to be such a low-maintenance production, but it works well, moving from room to room, and using every inch of the house to the film's advantage.  Each area is a pivotal location for the progression of the story, which obviously includes the basement.  It seems like such a played out place to have the most importance scenes of a horror flick. However, it sets the tone of the film from the moment the Perron family discovers it (yes, they had to discover the basement).Speaking of pivotal pieces of the film, there are no more pivotal objects than the props themselves, which are of dire importance to the plot-line.  For instance, Ed Warren keeps an ""evil museum"" of sorts in which he stores items from each of his cases - one of which is a freighting doll that provides for an extremely creepy opening scene to the film.  Aside from the doll, a bizarre music box with a circus theme (and of course a clown is inside) and a mirror within creates a method for seeing one of the spirits within the house.  Either of these two props alone could easily keep someone that's easily spooked awake at night.For reasons beyond comprehension, horror movies are a popular means of entertainment.  Not only are they popular, but they've provided some of the most unexpected hits in recent memory.  Obviously, moviegoers love to be scared, only without the consequences (which says a whole lot of bothersome things about society) - yet that doesn't change the fact that these movies provide for chilling and terrifying fun.  While the majority of horror films are either a major hit or a complete miss, The Conjuring absolutely earns high marks for its effort.  The film includes a great cast, well-rounded plot, and enough suspense to leave wear marks on the edge of your seat.  While this film is clearly only for a small target audience (teens, young adults, and horror fans), it will appease skeptics and be loved by horror buffs.  So, if you're even slightly interested in the horror/suspense genre, don't waste another moment - get to the theater!  There won't be a single moment in the entirety of this film that will leave you disappointed.

1630111,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B00BEIYMAG,Andre Dursin,"[169, 198]","Gut wrenching, beautifully filmed and perfectly paced, THE CONJURING isn't just one of the best supernatural chillers of recent years - it truly deserves a place next to ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Innocents"" and ""Poltergeist"" as one of the more memorable cinematic excursions into the paranormal ever produced. That may sound like high praise, but walking out of director James Wan's stunning thriller, I was hard pressed to think of other horror movies that have captivated me from start to end as much as this one did.Chad and Carey Hayes' screenplay takes the true story of a Rhode Island family's haunting in the early `70s and embellishes it into a film that grips you from its earliest frames, while Wan - the director who single-handedly launched a decades worth of gory ""torture porn"" pictures with the original ""Saw"" - here demonstrates a far greater command of the screen with what many have already called a directorial tour de force. In fact, Wan utilizes a documentary-styled approach that's closer to William Friedkin's 1973 classic than any other supernatural film I can recall, and expertly works with John R. Leonetti's cinematography and a masterful sound design to create one of the more brilliantly directed pictures this genre has seen in years.The Perron family - led by parents Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston - move into their home in northern Rhode Island and quickly notice standbys of any film haunting: bumps in the night, unseen forces that cause their dog to bark, and an occasional chill that permeates the air. Their five young daughters, though, are quickly put into the crosshair of a supernatural entity that wants more than to just make its presence known, physically announcing itself by grabbing the girls and causing bruises to Taylor that she believes are just the result of an iron deficiency. Ultimately, the Perrons call in paranormal experts Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Fermiga and Patrick Wilson), the earliest ""Ghost Hunters,"" who soon realize the family isn't suffering from a noisy oil burner on its last legs causing a ruckus.""The Conjuring"" carries an R rating but the film's violence is minimal and its profanity nearly non-existent. Wan eschews the gratuitousness of his past works in favor of a less is more approach that's just as scary for what you don't see as what you do (particularly when young Andrea Perron first encounters a ghost, standing in the corner of her room but only visible to her - not the audience). At first, it might be easy to resist the movie's familiar structure, but as the story unfolds, it's nearly impossible not to get wrapped up in the family's plight as the supernatural occurrences increase. The effectiveness is all due to Wan's direction and the uniformly believable performances of Taylor, Fermiga and Wilson, not to mention the unaffected young actresses playing the tormented Perron girls. Yet even with all the chilling moments, you come to care about these people, and the emotional catharsis that closes the picture is something few films in this genre have been able to duplicate (kudos to Joseph Bishara for a moody, effective score as well, with Mark Isham contributing a poignant ""family theme"" that plays a significant role in the film's concluding moments).""The Conjuring"" is at a disadvantage compared to other films in its genre because it's had to follow classic films like ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Haunting"" and ""Poltergeist."" For viewers resistant to horror films in general, there's probably little here they haven't seen before, and one could argue the more explicitly visceral elements of the haunting are its weakest asset. Nevertheless, Wan's movie grabs you and doesn't let go until the credits have rolled - and even then, you might be checking the rear view mirror, just to make sure nothing's followed you home. That's frightful filmmaking at its finest, and ""The Conjuring"" is unquestionably the most effective cinematic haunt of this generation.",5,The Most Effective Cinematic Haunt of this Generation,1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,3952,"['Gut', 'wrenching', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'perfectly', 'paced', 'CONJURING', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'best', 'supernatural', 'chillers', 'recent', 'years', 'truly', 'place', 'next', 'Exorcist', 'Innocents', 'Poltergeist', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'cinematic', 'excursions', 'paranormal', 'ever', 'produced', 'may', 'sound', 'high', 'praise', 'walking', 'director', 'James', 'Wan', 'stunning', 'thriller', 'was', 'hard', 'pressed', 'think', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'captivated', 'start', 'end', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'did.Chad', 'Carey', 'Hayes', 'screenplay', 'true', 'story', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'family', 'haunting', 'early', '70s', 'embellishes', 'film', 'earliest', 'frames', 'Wan', 'director', 'who', 'single-handedly', 'launched', 'decades', 'gory', 'torture', 'porn', 'pictures', 'original', 'Saw', 'here', 'far', 'greater', 'command', 'screen', 'what', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'called', 'directorial', 'tour', 'force', 'fact', 'Wan', 'documentary-styled', 'approach', 'closer', 'William', 'Friedkin', '1973', 'classic', 'other', 'supernatural', 'film', 'can', 'recall', 'expertly', 'John', 'R.', 'Leonetti', 'cinematography', 'masterful', 'sound', 'design', 'create', 'one', 'more', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'pictures', 'genre', 'seen', 'years.The', 'Perron', 'family', 'led', 'parents', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'move', 'home', 'northern', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'quickly', 'notice', 'standbys', 'film', 'haunting', 'bumps', 'night', 'unseen', 'forces', 'cause', 'dog', 'bark', 'occasional', 'chill', 'air', 'five', 'young', 'daughters', 'are', 'quickly', 'put', 'crosshair', 'supernatural', 'entity', 'more', 'just', 'make', 'presence', 'known', 'physically', 'announcing', 'grabbing', 'girls', 'causing', 'bruises', 'Taylor', 'are', 'just', 'result', 'iron', 'deficiency', 'Ultimately', 'Perrons', 'call', 'paranormal', 'experts', 'Lorraine', 'Ed', 'Warren', 'Vera', 'Fermiga', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'earliest', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'who', 'soon', 'realize', 'family', ""n't"", 'suffering', 'noisy', 'oil', 'burner', 'last', 'legs', 'causing', 'ruckus', 'Conjuring', 'R', 'rating', 'film', 'violence', 'minimal', 'profanity', 'nearly', 'non-existent', 'Wan', 'gratuitousness', 'past', 'works', 'favor', 'less', 'more', 'approach', 'just', 'scary', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'do', 'particularly', 'when', 'young', 'Andrea', 'Perron', 'first', 'ghost', 'standing', 'corner', 'room', 'only', 'visible', 'not', 'audience', 'first', 'might', 'be', 'easy', 'resist', 'movie', 'familiar', 'structure', 'story', 'unfolds', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'not', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'family', 'plight', 'supernatural', 'occurrences', 'increase', 'effectiveness', 'due', 'Wan', 'direction', 'uniformly', 'believable', 'performances', 'Taylor', 'Fermiga', 'Wilson', 'not', 'mention', 'unaffected', 'young', 'actresses', 'playing', 'tormented', 'Perron', 'girls', 'even', 'chilling', 'moments', 'come', 'care', 'people', 'emotional', 'catharsis', 'picture', 'something', 'few', 'films', 'genre', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'duplicate', 'kudos', 'Joseph', 'Bishara', 'moody', 'effective', 'score', 'as', 'well', 'Mark', 'Isham', 'contributing', 'poignant', 'family', 'theme', 'significant', 'role', 'film', 'concluding', 'moments', 'Conjuring', 'disadvantage', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'had', 'follow', 'classic', 'films', 'Exorcist', 'Haunting', 'Poltergeist', 'viewers', 'resistant', 'horror', 'films', 'general', 'probably', 'little', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'more', 'explicitly', 'visceral', 'elements', 'haunting', 'are', 'weakest', 'asset', 'Nevertheless', 'Wan', 'movie', 'grabs', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'even', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'checking', 'rear', 'view', 'mirror', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'nothing', 'followed', 'home', 'frightful', 'filmmaking', 'finest', 'Conjuring', 'unquestionably', 'most', 'effective', 'cinematic', 'haunt', 'generation']",N/A

There was much focus on the characters; especially the Warrens as they became the focus of the movie and how their ordeals in the past would resurrect again.Overall, I highly recommend this movie even after seeing the movie a second time the scares can come off as comical but are still effective for enjoyment purposes. Some may say that too much is revealed in terms of what the unknown entity may be and becomes less interesting as the film progresses. I would argue not and say the story was balanced and kept my attention all the way through.

However the true effect of this movie is the terror of reality. While it does have the traditional bangs etc the true terror comes from the fact it happened. Thus it can happen to you. The actual people said that Hollywood refused to put in the most terrifying events, and I really don't like that. One of the reasons is it would be too scary. I feel that in order to defeat evil you must know what you're fighting. Also the adding into the story for drama, especially at the end was a little disappointing to me. But it's all very well done.The film makes it clear that not only does God exist but so does the devil. Without forcing religion down the audiences throat. The acting is great, my only complaint is I wish it was longer. If ever I wanted a movie to be three hours this is it. The moral of this story is beware what you wish for. Since, like many people today, the stars of the film make a living looking for the paranormal. Problem is no one ever asks what if we find something, and what happens if it isn't Casper? I also loved the fact this movie presents a much needed breath of fresh air into the horror genera by making an intelligent, amazing story. It challenges man to rethink his beliefs. I believe in God, but you can't have one without the other.

1630116,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00BEIYMAG,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[90, 110]","Before I get started on this review, I want everyone to ignore that infamous little phrase that gets attached to films like this. You know which one I'm talking about: ""Based on a true story."" I could go on about the trustworthyness of the Warrens or the lack thereof, but the best thing to do with this film is to ignore all of that. If you go into this with the idea that the Warrens are shameless hucksters, then you'll miss out on enjoying all that this film has to offer. If you go into this thinking that every frame is true or trying to explain to someone how all of this could've happened, you'll suffer the same fate. Just enjoy this for what it is: one of the first mainstream horror films released to the theaters in the summer in a long while.Now on to the proper review.I was thoroughly impressed by this movie. Supposedly this did insanely well when they ran this through test screenings and I can see why. The Conjuring had a lot to offer and didn't try to fill its running time by checking off every box on the horror movie cliche checklist. There are some tried and true formats here to be sure, but they're fairly well executed. The movie makes use of a lot of jump scares, so if you're irritated by those I would probably wait until this hits the rental sites. They're all done in good fun and are for the most part genuinely spooky, although I'll say that the jump scares were far more effective in the beginning of the movie.The acting was excellent in this and whomever thought to hire Lili Taylor should get a huge pat on the back. She's probably the strongest actor in this piece, second only to Vera Farmiga. The ladies genuinely rocked this movie fairly hard. The guys were good as well, but let's not pretend that they were there for anything other than to be played off the women.Now as far as story goes, this was decent. It's actually a fairly simplistic story line when you get down to it. There wasn't a lot of gussying up of the subject matter, although there was somewhat of a side story that surrounded the Warrens' daughter, the demon, and a doll from the beginning of the movie. I do have to admit that I'm not sure what I felt about that part. The doll's acquisition was shown at the beginning of the movie and largely had nothing to do with what the Perrons went through, except for showing up in one scene. The scare surrounding this scene was decent, but I kind of feel that it was one of the two weakest scenes in the film. The other weakest scene? I hate to say it, but it was the showdown in the end. I liked it well enough and it was entertaining, but it also felt slightly anticlimactic. Most viewers won't feel let down by the scene, although my friends and I all agreed that although this was an incredibly strong horror movie, the ending did sort of leave a little to be desired in comparison with the rest of the film.In the end though, the concerns are all fairly minor quibbles. This will still be an excellent film to go see in the theaters and something that I'd recommend for horror fans- especially those who love the older stuff. The director took great pains to make the opening and ending feel like something you'd have seen in the older days of horror, which I greatly appreciated. I'd say that this film is good enough to where it's something I'd outright own when it releases on DVD and assuming that the sequel will be as well done as this was, I'll be there on the opening weekend for whatever other movie they make.On a side note, if you can, see this with a more full theater. I was lucky enough that my fellow theater goers were excellent companions to watch a movie with. They reacted at all the right times, which made everything in the movie that much more scary for myself and my friends.",4,"A nice, suitably spooky movie",1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,3759,"['get', 'started', 'review', 'want', 'everyone', 'ignore', 'infamous', 'little', 'phrase', 'attached', 'films', 'know', 'one', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'could', 'go', 'trustworthyness', 'Warrens', 'lack', 'thereof', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'film', 'ignore', 'go', 'idea', 'Warrens', 'are', 'shameless', 'hucksters', 'then', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'out', 'enjoying', 'film', 'offer', 'go', 'thinking', 'frame', 'true', 'trying', 'explain', 'someone', 'how', 'could', ""'ve"", 'happened', ""'ll"", 'suffer', 'same', 'fate', 'Just', 'enjoy', 'what', 'one', 'first', 'mainstream', 'horror', 'films', 'released', 'theaters', 'summer', 'long', 'while.Now', 'proper', 'review.I', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'impressed', 'movie', 'Supposedly', 'did', 'insanely', 'well', 'when', 'ran', 'test', 'screenings', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Conjuring', 'had', 'lot', 'offer', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'fill', 'running', 'time', 'checking', 'off', 'box', 'horror', 'movie', 'cliche', 'checklist', 'are', 'tried', 'true', 'formats', 'here', 'be', 'sure', ""'re"", 'fairly', 'well', 'executed', 'movie', 'use', 'lot', 'jump', 'scares', 'so', ""'re"", 'irritated', 'would', 'probably', 'wait', 'rental', 'sites', ""'re"", 'done', 'good', 'fun', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'genuinely', 'spooky', ""'ll"", 'say', 'jump', 'scares', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'beginning', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'thought', 'hire', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'should', 'get', 'huge', 'pat', 'back', 'probably', 'strongest', 'actor', 'piece', 'second', 'only', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'ladies', 'genuinely', 'rocked', 'movie', 'fairly', 'hard', 'guys', 'were', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'let', 'not', 'pretend', 'were', 'there', 'anything', 'other', 'be', 'played', 'off', 'women.Now', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'was', 'decent', 'actually', 'fairly', 'simplistic', 'story', 'line', 'when', 'get', 'down', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'gussying', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'somewhat', 'side', 'story', 'surrounded', 'Warrens', 'daughter', 'demon', 'doll', 'beginning', 'movie', 'do', 'have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'felt', 'part', 'doll', 'acquisition', 'was', 'shown', 'beginning', 'movie', 'largely', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'what', 'Perrons', 'went', 'showing', 'up', 'one', 'scene', 'scare', 'surrounding', 'scene', 'was', 'decent', 'kind', 'feel', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'weakest', 'scenes', 'film', 'other', 'weakest', 'scene', 'hate', 'say', 'was', 'showdown', 'end', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'was', 'entertaining', 'also', 'felt', 'slightly', 'anticlimactic', 'Most', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'let', 'down', 'scene', 'friends', 'agreed', 'was', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'horror', 'movie', 'ending', 'did', 'sort', 'leave', 'little', 'be', 'desired', 'comparison', 'rest', 'film.In', 'end', 'concerns', 'are', 'fairly', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'excellent', 'film', 'go', 'see', 'theaters', 'something', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'horror', 'fans-', 'especially', 'who', 'love', 'older', 'stuff', 'director', 'took', 'great', 'pains', 'make', 'opening', 'ending', 'feel', 'something', ""'d"", 'have', 'seen', 'older', 'days', 'horror', 'greatly', 'appreciated', ""'d"", 'say', 'film', 'good', 'enough', 'where', 'something', ""'d"", 'outright', 'own', 'when', 'DVD', 'assuming', 'sequel', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'was', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there', 'opening', 'weekend', 'other', 'movie', 'make.On', 'side', 'note', 'can', 'see', 'more', 'full', 'theater', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'fellow', 'theater', 'goers', 'were', 'excellent', 'companions', 'watch', 'movie', 'reacted', 'right', 'times', 'made', 'everything', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'scary', 'myself', 'friends']",N/A

First bruises appear out of no where, clocks stop, weird smells occur and everything quickly gets worse. As the situation progressively gets worse Carolyn attends a class where Ed and Lorraine Warren are teaching and explaining what they do and about the paranormal. Carolyn seeks their help and has them come to her home to see if they can rid her family and home of this dark presence. The Warrens discover this to be their most difficult and horrifying case.The film is based on a true story which alone makes it that much more frightening. There's no gore, nudity, and honestly I can't remember any swearing either. So a film being rated R for purely the scare factor should peak your interest.The acting was great.

1630119,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00BEIYMAG,DanD,"[4, 4]","Modern horror films just aren't that scary anymore.  They rely on jump scares, gore, and horny teenagers.  Sure, this started quite a while back; but the films coming out today take themselves way too seriously to even have that ""camp"" factor that makes them so enjoyable.  Make no mistake: there is no camp about THE CONJURING.  There is also almost no gore, surprisingly few jump scares, and nary a bikini-clad coed to be seen.  Instead, we have those bits 'n pieces that make a truly great horror film: tension, suspense, and something actually at stake.The plot revolves around the Parron family, who move into a secluded country house that, unbeknownst to them, has a sordid, violent history.  Things start happening that very first night, and slowly escalate so badly that wife Carolyn invites the Warrens to investigate.  Ed and Lorraine Warren are the seventies' version of ghost hunters, who've seen and documented demonic possession.  They immediately recognize the evil in the Parron household...and are also forced to admit that their presence may be too little, too late.Ultimately, THE CONJURING boils down to a possession film, and as such does fall short of the ""greatness"" mark; the only truly great possession film I can think of is THE EXORCIST (although I'll admit, I tend to dislike most possession premises).  CONJURING's conclusion, too, embodies the low-blow theatrics that the rest of the film shirks.  So that's a bit of a shame, that it doesn't end on a strong note.  But getting there...oh boy.  The film truly revolves around atmosphere, using shadows, sound effects, and solid acting to slowly ramp up the tension.  The four adult leads (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Ron Livingston, and especially Lili Taylor) are fantastic, though it's the child actors who truly shine (perhaps because it's so hard to find good child acting in horror films; that's one improvement modern horror films have, but it's a very small edge).  The script is solid for the most part, and the direction/camerawork are effective.  James Wan has delivered a solid, truly unsettling horror film.  He may have started the SAW franchise (though the first one, the only one which Wan directed, is actually a darn good movie), but he's been spending his time making up for all the lackluster sequels that film has inspired.  THE CONJURING is a film that can please on almost all levels: people who simply like to get a good scare in with their friends will be satisfied, as will those who prefer a horror film with some depth and lasting effect.  It's not a classic-in-the-making, perhaps, and it's not great, but it's pretty darn good, and pretty darn scary, and those are rare in horror cinema these days.",4,"Made the old-fashion way, built around tension and suspense.",1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,2708,"['Modern', 'horror', 'films', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'scary', 'anymore', 'rely', 'jump', 'scares', 'gore', 'horny', 'teenagers', 'Sure', 'started', 'quite', 'while', 'back', 'films', 'coming', 'out', 'today', 'take', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'even', 'have', 'camp', 'factor', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'Make', 'mistake', 'camp', 'CONJURING', 'also', 'almost', 'gore', 'surprisingly', 'few', 'jump', 'scares', 'nary', 'bikini-clad', 'coed', 'be', 'seen', 'Instead', 'have', 'bits', 'n', 'pieces', 'make', 'truly', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'tension', 'suspense', 'something', 'actually', 'stake.The', 'plot', 'revolves', 'Parron', 'family', 'who', 'move', 'secluded', 'country', 'house', 'unbeknownst', 'sordid', 'violent', 'history', 'Things', 'start', 'happening', 'very', 'first', 'night', 'slowly', 'escalate', 'so', 'badly', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'Warrens', 'investigate', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'are', 'seventies', 'version', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'documented', 'demonic', 'possession', 'immediately', 'recognize', 'evil', 'Parron', 'household', 'are', 'also', 'forced', 'admit', 'presence', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.Ultimately', 'THE', 'CONJURING', 'down', 'possession', 'film', 'such', 'fall', 'short', 'greatness', 'mark', 'only', 'truly', 'great', 'possession', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'EXORCIST', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'tend', 'dislike', 'most', 'possession', 'premises', 'CONJURING', 'conclusion', 'too', 'low-blow', 'theatrics', 'rest', 'film', 'shirks', 'bit', 'shame', ""n't"", 'end', 'strong', 'note', 'getting', 'there', 'oh', 'boy', 'film', 'truly', 'atmosphere', 'using', 'shadows', 'sound', 'effects', 'solid', 'acting', 'slowly', 'ramp', 'up', 'tension', 'four', 'adult', 'leads', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'especially', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'are', 'fantastic', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'truly', 'shine', 'perhaps', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'good', 'child', 'acting', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'improvement', 'modern', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'very', 'small', 'edge', 'script', 'solid', 'most', 'part', 'direction/camerawork', 'are', 'effective', 'James', 'Wan', 'delivered', 'solid', 'truly', 'unsettling', 'horror', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'started', 'SAW', 'franchise', 'first', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'Wan', 'directed', 'actually', 'darn', 'good', 'movie', 'been', 'spending', 'time', 'making', 'up', 'lackluster', 'sequels', 'film', 'inspired', 'CONJURING', 'film', 'can', 'please', 'almost', 'levels', 'people', 'who', 'simply', 'get', 'good', 'scare', 'friends', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'will', 'who', 'prefer', 'horror', 'film', 'depth', 'lasting', 'effect', 'not', 'classic-in-the-making', 'perhaps', 'not', 'great', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'pretty', 'darn', 'scary', 'are', 'rare', 'horror', 'cinema', 'days']",N/A
1630120,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B00BEIYMAG,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","Supposedly based on a true story, director James Wan's THE CONJURING is about an unsuspecting family of seven moving into a secluded farmhouse (Why is it always a secluded farmhouse?) that's full of dark, demonic forces.  As the hauntings and disturbings ratchet up in intensity, the Perron family enlists the aid of Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson), paranormal ""investigators"" who thoroughly inspect and examine the house--and conclude the structure is in dire need of an exorcism.  Yet there is no time to obtain the Catholic Church's blessing, as the main spirit has possessed matriarch Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor); accordingly Ed Warren must attempt the exorcism himself.  This sequence produces some of the film's scariest--and unfortunately, most laughable--moments, culminating in the predictable fuzzy ending.Yes, THE CONJURING has its scary moments, but it also has its over-the-top moments, and throughout this extraordinarily uneven film it almost telegraphs its predictability.  The chemistry between Farmiga and Wilson is passing, yet the characters keep getting bogged down when Ed continues to object to Lorraine going with him to investigate, with Lorraine in kind overruling the objection.

The performances are terrific, which is not a surprise considering the cast and special props to the young girls who are very good as well. The moments that we are set up are genuinely scary without being too overt. It takes skill to scare. The director did a magnificent job with this film. It still gets to me just thinking of it. And it is old-fashioned in that regard. It rarely gives us the shaky cam look I cannot stand. There is little CGI. Not much blood or gore. I have seen it four times. And it is something special.SPOILERSThen we get to the exorcism. That is the only part where I felt the film lost its way. It's not bad at all but doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the film. I guess it is eventual that they had to up the ante on the film level but I was still a bit disappointed.Not enough to stop me from loving this very scary film. It is a film that is fun and scary to watch simultaneously.And I enjoyed the extra features, particularly the interview with the family who experienced this (although how much of it is not said). The mother talks about even today she is scared and won't go back to the house. Although I heard from someone who recently said she 'must' go back. And then she won't even watch this film. It suddenly dawned on me that whatever she experienced, it was certainly real to her and to her family.No matter how much, or how little, of this film is based on actual events, I don't really care that much. Because it is a film. Not a documentary. They are trying to create entertainment. With that in mind, this is one of the very best horror movies ever made. Even with the ending exorcism I feel the rest of the film more than compensates.If your idea of horror is the bloodier, the gorier, the slashier the better?

The plot started out great with a few simple doors opening , apparitions here and there and noise. So the family hires a married couple who are ghost hunters too see and inspect the house.  I would say I did like how wan portrayed the apparitions via pictures and the sound affects.  I think  the possessions were to much overdone or fake as we speak with the mother.  It was difficult too visualize the mother running around the house as a zombie and being possessed.Overall its a very good movie but compared to other haunted movies, I would rate this in my top 10 but not top 5...  The only reason I would give it a 4 star rather than a 5 is because the second half of the film was intense but maybe too intense..  for example, the ghost hunter falls into this hole and onto the basement and doesn't even gets hurt... and of course the possession could of been more subtle.real hauntings like in documentaries don't have ghosts climbing walls and someone turning into a zombie such as Hollywood portrays.. Its more subtle and in a way where you do see images and noise and on occasion you will get intimated by its presence .

1630133,A311626XD2C4T2,B00BEIYMAG,JordanJasper,"[10, 13]","The product being churned out by the film industry continues to degenerate. It's getting discouraging.&#60;---Make that sentence past tense, come to think of it.Yet another gazillion bucks (relatively speaking) are spent to assemble a team of capable actors, set designers and effects artists, etc. More millions are spent crafting a trailer that truly does intrigue viewers (not as easy a thing to do as many people might believe), a massive ad-campaign is launched and, finally, upon release, most of us who still possess the ability to think in linear terms discover that no one bothered to hire writers with the talent needed to craft an entire and compelling film narrative. SPOILERS AHEAD. Let's get to the film.There's no reason this could not have been a gripping movie, given the money spent and the team of actors involved. A few original ideas and some deft plotting could have turned this up several notches. As it is, we have a textbook derivative &#34;story&#34; (supposedly &#34;based on true events&#34; -- which is the first reason to roll one's eyes, whenever Hollywood says that, these days) and a few clever ideas thrown randomly into the proceedings. A large family moves into a farmhouse and discovers it to be haunted. They are perplexed. Meanwhile, a couple of ghost-hunters &#34;with a past&#34; are drawn into the mix. One of the most STUPID atrocities committed right off the bat is that the Lady Ghost-Hunter (Huntress?) reveals to the audience the exact nature of the haunting in its entirety. A cackling old witch related to someone involved with the Salem witch scandals used to own the property and hung herself from a tree in the front yard after sacrificing her baby and has threatened to punish anyone who gets involved with her land thereafter. Well, thank you very much! Aside from that being a completely moronic back-story (see below), why tell the audience all of this before the movie gets hopping? Why not keep it a mystery to add an element of suspense for the viewer, and trust me, this film *needs* suspense. Why not make this backstory something the ghost-hunters must unravel during their ongoing investigation? Forget about that helpful hint from Plot Construction 101.Everything that follows involves your garden-variety Things That Go Bump in the Night, Something Invisible Pulled My Leg, The Clocks Stop a Little After 3AM!, Let's Set Up Some Religious Icons Around the House, Little Amy's Got an Imaginary Playmate, and Who Knew There Was a Boarded-Up Cellar in This Place? drivel. All of these motifs have been used before and to much greater cinematic effect. The whole thing plays like a dreary mashup of Poltergeist + An American Haunting + Paranormal Activity + The Exorcist + The Amityville Horror + Name Your Rip-Off Scare-Flick. Overall, there's not a frightening thing about this movie's impact, though a couple of scary images and gags do work well (the imagery of the oncoming storm and the brief shape-shifting of the clothesline bedsheet, the spiral-mirrored music box, a creepy game of clap-tag). A worthwhile film is not made by a few clever sight-gags, however. The actors, from Lily Taylor to Vera Farmiga to Ron Livingston all do fine work. Even the kids are convincing and obviously talented. Patrick Wilson is about as wooden and silly as the Annabelle Doll that plays an unintentionally funny cameo role, but no matter how competent or incompetent the cast, they can't do much with a hackneyed storyline. On the plus-side, the sets are excellent --very 1971-era authentic-- and the cinematography is solid. Kudos to the crews responsible for those elements. The smartest character in this botched affair was the dog, who knew a stinker (and a haunted house) when she smelled one and had the good sense to croak in her third scene, albeit without much emotional resonance or exploration. How vapid.This brings me back to the foolishness of this film's backstory and the precipitous revelation of that backstory (see above). Is the crazy old witch a ghost, or a demon, or what? In the very first scene of this flick, the Warrens explicitly counsel a bunch of nitwits that ghosts have no power to cause physical harm. Only demons &#34;which have never walked in human form&#34; can do that stuff. Well, this human witch apparently hung herself and stayed on in the house (or around the property) as a ghost. That is, until she possesses the mother ... which would make her a demon? But she was human. And if this witch-ghostie-demon has the power to summon storms and flocks of birds and levitate and teleport and make things fly through the air, why did she hang herself from a tree in her nightgown in the first place? What was she afraid of, with all that power? Gah! This plot has more holes than a bag of Swiss Cheese slices and there's no rescuing a film this ultimately stupid and obvious and gimmicky and incoherent and half-baked.

Anything that can be cheaply made by studios to rake in tons of dough at the box office are automatics (this is why Paranormal Activity could essentially continue on forever). In my mind the definitive haunted house movie will always be The Poltergeist, and the standard equivalent of the possession movie will always be The Exorcist. Not surprising right?However, both of those movies were not specifically based on true stories. This is where The Conjuring comes in. You can only sing the same song so many times before it gets old and tiresome, The Conjuring puts a genuine twist on the story by making it feel real without using the 'documentary' style filmmaking (which I always thought was a cheap gimmick).

His first SAW film was the best of the bunch and while Insidious had flaws, it also had some great scare moments and visuals. The Conjuring is a near perfect ghost/demonic possession movie. The scares are not cheap and they are 90% effective. A couple felt a little forced, but overall this is one the creepiest movies I have seen in theaters.Based on a ""true story"" that takes place in 1971, a family becomes the victim of some evil forces in their new house. Two paranormal investigators are brought in to gather evidence. They are based on the famous couple that also investigated The Amityville Horror years later.The acting is great all around from the kids and adults. I like how they didn't use any big name actors. Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson and Ron Livingston are relatively well known, but thankfully no huge star power here to completely take you out of the film.Very little gore, no foul language or nudity in a horror movie? Believe it or not, this thing earned the R rating for pure scares alone. Now don't get too overhyped or anything. I personally didn't jump in my seat or want to cover my eyes (though many scenes are quite chilling), but plenty of people around me did.This is the first movie that has made me want to review it in a month.

Last night (night before Halloween) Ms. Warren gave a lecture to a sold-out crowd at SCSU. Not only The Conjuring, but many other movies have been created based off of their work, such as The Haunted and The Haunting in Connecticut. They are also featured in the book THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, which has been the basis of ten films.As for The Conjuring, it begins with the story of Annabelle, the possessed doll (Google ""the Warrens Annabelle"" for a creepy tale). I wish the movie ventured more into this tale, but they had to move on to the haunting that took place in Rhode Island.Once viewers are brought to Rhode Island, everything moves at a nice slow-burned pace. Any creepy moments are signified by the shaking of the camera. Admittedly, this would be a lame technique if used throughout, but it's not. About halfway through the movie, things ramp-up to full scare mode. Things fly off of walls, shadows move out of the corners, doors slam, and the monster shows itself.Everything worked together nicely until about the end.

However, in the last 1-2 decades, they just did not have the same appeal to me anymore. I try to watch them but I end up turning them off and find them silly/poorly done/bad story/bad acting/etc. Very few scary movies seem capable of holding my attention now days. The reviews for this movie gave me the impression it might be better.Basic premise: The family moves into a house that has an evil spirit and starts terrorizing them. They ask two known paranormal experts to help them rid their family of the entity.This basic premise has been done over and over again. Did this movie do a good job? Yes they did.This movie is not overdone, underdone, it is just right in so many ways. The acting, the CGI and the writing are all well done. This movie kept my attention from beginning to end. In fact, it left me wanting to see more. A rarity these days. I would like for the same makers to make a movie about the doll.Family friendly: Only scary parts. No nudity, sex nor offensive language.If you are looking for blood and guts or tons of gore this is not your movie. The movie is not super scary. This is pretty good story telling with better than average acting and the special effects were perfect for the movie. It is like the people that made the movie really wanted to make a quality scary movie. It probably won't win any awards but compared to the competition, it is by far the best scary movie I have seen in a long time.4 stars for a movie is a very good rating from me. Friends/family know I watch a lot of movies and often ask me for recommendations.ETA: I have seen several reviewers mention/compare the movie ""Insidious."" I decided to give it a watch tonight. First, I did not realize I had seen ""Insidious"" before until I got to the bed scene. I thought some stuff looked familiar. I rented this movie some time back and turned it off before it ended.
