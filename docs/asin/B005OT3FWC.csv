1496771,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B005OT3FWC,Joseph M. Reninger,"[0, 0]","Portraying a theological disputation in a dramatic way is a difficult challenge. One imagines medieval university debates as a bunch of robed monks sitting around and chatting in dimly lit chambers. The movie does have a good bit of this atmosphere. Most of the action takes place at the University of Paris in dark lecture halls, small cells, and a candle-lit chapel. The final dispute is held outdoors, with Franciscan John Duns Scotus and his Dominican interlocutors walking around a bit, providing some visual variety to an otherwise typical depiction of the middle ages.The central debate is about the Immaculate Conception, the (now dogma) that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was preserved from original sin from the moment of her conception. Many medieval theologians, including Thomas Aquinas, did not see how this was possible. The debate came to a crescendo at the University of Paris in 1305, when Scotus agreed to dispute the point with another theologian. The scene is nicely realized, with enough theological and philosophical background presented earlier in the film to make the arguments understandable. The argument is repeated by Pope Pius IX in his declaration of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception in 1854.The movie does a great job building a believable and engaging personality for Scotus. He has a great deal of humility but also a great deal of conviction. He knows what he knows not just through studying theological and philosophical texts, but also through contemplation, especially of the Eucharist. He relies on grace from God just as much (perhaps even more than) to teach what he has learned, what he has discovered. The actor, Adriano Braidotti, does a good job though the character does not have a huge emotional range. Enough of Scotus's history is included to make it a satisfactory bio-pic, though the religious debate is clearly the central part of the movie.There's a bit too much of his interactions with three novices, who seem to be added to the story to provide comic relief and a minor love interest. It felt a bit like the romance was included because that's what is in movies. Another challenge for this movie is the dependence on exposition over visual presentation of information. That's the way debates happened in the 1300s--there was no PowerPoint or props. But since Scotus often discusses the importance of the beauty of creation, it would have been better to have more visuals to support those ideas.Otherwise, this movie is an interesting watch though I am not sure it would have general appeal apart from people interested in Scotus or the Immaculate Conception.",3,Good enough as a bio-pic or a theological discussion,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,2617,"['Portraying', 'theological', 'disputation', 'dramatic', 'way', 'difficult', 'challenge', 'One', 'imagines', 'medieval', 'university', 'debates', 'bunch', 'robed', 'monks', 'sitting', 'around', 'chatting', 'dimly', 'lit', 'chambers', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 'bit', 'atmosphere', 'Most', 'action', 'place', 'University', 'Paris', 'dark', 'lecture', 'halls', 'small', 'cells', 'candle-lit', 'chapel', 'final', 'dispute', 'held', 'outdoors', 'Franciscan', 'John', 'Duns', 'Scotus', 'Dominican', 'interlocutors', 'walking', 'around', 'bit', 'providing', 'visual', 'variety', 'otherwise', 'typical', 'depiction', 'middle', 'ages.The', 'central', 'debate', 'Immaculate', 'Conception', 'now', 'Mary', 'mother', 'Jesus', 'was', 'preserved', 'original', 'sin', 'moment', 'conception', 'Many', 'medieval', 'theologians', 'including', 'Thomas', 'Aquinas', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'possible', 'debate', 'came', 'crescendo', 'University', 'Paris', '1305', 'when', 'Scotus', 'agreed', 'dispute', 'point', 'theologian', 'scene', 'nicely', 'realized', 'enough', 'theological', 'philosophical', 'background', 'presented', 'earlier', 'film', 'make', 'arguments', 'understandable', 'argument', 'repeated', 'Pope', 'Pius', 'IX', 'declaration', 'dogma', 'Immaculate', 'Conception', '1854.The', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'building', 'believable', 'engaging', 'personality', 'Scotus', 'great', 'deal', 'humility', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'conviction', 'what', 'not', 'just', 'studying', 'theological', 'philosophical', 'texts', 'also', 'contemplation', 'especially', 'Eucharist', 'grace', 'God', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'teach', 'what', 'learned', 'what', 'discovered', 'actor', 'Adriano', 'Braidotti', 'good', 'job', 'character', 'not', 'have', 'huge', 'emotional', 'range', 'Enough', 'Scotus', 'history', 'included', 'make', 'satisfactory', 'bio-pic', 'religious', 'debate', 'clearly', 'central', 'part', 'movie.There', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'interactions', 'three', 'novices', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'added', 'story', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'minor', 'love', 'interest', 'felt', 'bit', 'romance', 'was', 'included', 'what', 'movies', 'challenge', 'movie', 'dependence', 'exposition', 'visual', 'presentation', 'information', 'way', 'debates', 'happened', '1300s', 'was', 'PowerPoint', 'props', 'Scotus', 'often', 'importance', 'beauty', 'creation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'more', 'visuals', 'support', 'ideas.Otherwise', 'movie', 'interesting', 'watch', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'general', 'appeal', 'apart', 'people', 'interested', 'Scotus', 'Immaculate', 'Conception']",Blessed Duns Scotus: Defender of the Immaculate Conception
1496772,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B005OT3FWC,K. Ostrowski,"[52, 54]","For those who don't know, Duns Scotus was a Franciscan theologian, who argued for the immaculate conception of Mary; eventually overcoming the intellectual difficulties which had once prevented even Saint Thomas Aquinas from acknowledging the notion.  This eventually became a doctrine of the Catholic Church; an everlasting testament to the success of this great man.However, historically, Scotus is know primarily for his accomplishments in theology.  Little is known about his friends, his feelings, his motives (apart from holiness,) and so forth.  Because of this, I was expecting a rather dry movie about theological truths, but at the very least, something different from the norm.However, what I got instead was a sort of midway point between what I was expecting (and hoping) to get, and your average, run-of-the-mill studio flick.  There are things this movie does, which it shouldn't.  Regardless, I think I should talk about the good parts first, before moving on to the bad.The costumes in this movie are excellent, for what they're intended to depict, and much of the acting is very good as well, though I thought the main lead was a bit too melodramatic; particularly when the situation didn't call for it.  It's a minor gripe at best, though.The scenery is a little lackluster.  It seems that they had an abbey and a countryside to film in, and that's just what they did.  Still, the story doesn't call for much else, and I was never expecting the film to dazzle me with its visual panoramas.Much of Scotus' theology is faithfully depicted in this movie, just as I was hoping it would be.  However, there's one scene where, rather than discussing things like formal distinction or haecceity, he talks about ""the eucharist being for the purpose of uniting everything.""  I'm not convinced that he would ever say it as imprecisely as this.  The Eucharist is for the purpose of uniting people to God, not to one another, and certainly not to the world.  Still, again, a minor gripe.The one thing that I don't consider minor, and the one thing that I refuse to let pass is the truly awful subplot about a seminarian who learns theology under Scotus, leaves the seminary to get married to a flower girl, and is encouraged in this by Scotus using, it must be admitted, no coherent reasoning at all.  Stupid, empty-headed romances pop up like daffodils in the modern moviescape, it seems, and no film featuring such will ever get a perfect score from me.This movie tries to stuff a romance into a story about a great theologian, but it's a very badly-written romance, so it won't really appeal to the romantic.  It tries to depict a debate on theology, but you have to get to that debate by skipping over a horrible romance subplot, so theology students would be better served by just reading a book.I want to give this movie a good grade, because at least 75% of it is spent discussing theology and holiness, and that's a rare thing these days.  Still, I need to acknowledge its failings as well.  This movie wasn't terrible, but it could and should have been better than it was.",4,"Why, oh, Why?  Romance?

The cinematography was excellent and the acting was great.  The subject matter is Theology-Philosophy based on Duns Scotus' defense of the Immaculate Conception and so is not for the casual viewer.  Philosophy is not my strongest subject and the movie is in Italian (a beautiful language), but since I don't speak Italian I had to read the subtitles over and over again. I must add that I probably would have done this even if it had been in English.The movie follows Duns Scotus' life from when he joined the Franciscan order as a child to when he debates with the Dominican Theologians.  The scenes from his life exemplify his maturing into an important Theologian.  Duns Scotus was a Franciscan theologian and St. Francis taught of the beauty of simplicity in language and reaching the common man and so the reasoning is beautifully simple.  And yet, simplicity in language often leads to various interpretations (and does so in this movie).  My only criticism of this movie is that the debate at the end with the Dominican Theologians was a one sided debate, I would have liked to hear more of the Dominican logic.

It means ""God could do it, it was appropriate, therefore he did it"". A defense taken by Blessed Duns Scotus.And this line is from the movie itself.This film has got to be one of the most intense movies made about the lives of the saints.....not so much about his life but his teachings and convictions.Blessed Duns Scotus was one of the most prolific theologians of the middle ages and for his works he was given the title 'Doctor Subtilis'(literally means the Subtle Doctor) for his deep thoughts and the eloquent manner in which he presented them. He is most renowned for making a very public defense on the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, taking on even the thoughts and teachings of that great Doctor of the Church, Saint Thomas Aquinas.The Immaculate Conception was actually a hotly debated topic and it had its supporters and detractors. Even the greatest devotee of the Virgin Mary, St. Bernard of Clairvaux  belonged to the latter group. Hence we get a picture of a man with lots of guts who was willing to debate the teachings of the great philosophers and theologians of all time.His motivation? A love for truth and study united with the Crucified Christ and a great love for the Eucharist, the Virgin Mary and charity for neighbor.To paraphrase a part of the dialogue from the film, Blessed Scotus admonishes his protege, William, that study, without being united to the Crucified Christ is not worth anything, and could lead to ruin... but united with Him is true Wisdom and Peace. FANTASTIC!!!!!Eventually his teaching would form the basis of the declaration of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception that was proclaimed in 1854.All this is magnificently portrayed in this film.Along with the most beautiful backdrops of ancient monasteries and rolling fields, and mixed in with deep provoking thoughts on Christian teaching. Truly, the viewer feels like a student transported to that time, witnessing the lectures and the intellectual debates that abound in this film and would deeply benefit from the sagacity of the dialogue. But be forewarned.....the main aspect of this film lies in the teachings (dialogue), hence one must watch this film with rapt attention. Even missing one line would seem like losing a treasure trove. It is very profound, so there might be some who just might find this film dull.The running time for this movie is 90 minutes in Italian with English and Spanish subtitles. The only special feature is a trailer for the movie.As with all movies from Ignatius press this DVD comes with a booklet, albeit a rather thin one of 8 pages but with great stills from the film. Its contents are as follows:1)About the film.2)Comments from the Director3)The life and thoughts of Blessed Duns Scotus4)Theology of Scotus5)The Immaculate Conception6)Praise of Scotus by Pope Benedict XVI7)Scene SelectionsA big part of this film was shot in a monastery so it appears a bit dark. However it creates the necessary ambiance to appreciate the times and the place.It is noteworthy that this film won 2 awards at the Mirabile Dictu International Catholic Film Festival, for Best Film and Best Actor.(OK,OK....so its not the Oscars.....!).This movie was also the official film for World Youth Day 2011, that was held in Madrid, Spain.To conclude, if you are devoted to the Blessed Mother or if you are just a religious movie junkie like me,.....this movie is definitely worth a buy!As an end note, Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception is the patroness of the USA. Hence it will serve as an aid to meditation, especially as her feast day is the 8th of December, which  this year falls next Thursday.",5,"""Potuit, decuit, ergo fecit!",1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,3720,"['words', 'St.', 'Anselm', 'Canterbury', 'principle', 'heading', 'review', 'God', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'appropriate', 'therefore', 'did', 'defense', 'taken', 'Blessed', 'Duns', 'Scotus.And', 'line', 'movie', 'itself.This', 'film', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'movies', 'made', 'lives', 'saints', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'teachings', 'convictions.Blessed', 'Duns', 'Scotus', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'prolific', 'theologians', 'middle', 'ages', 'works', 'was', 'given', 'title', ""'Doctor"", 'Subtilis', 'literally', 'Subtle', 'Doctor', 'deep', 'thoughts', 'eloquent', 'manner', 'presented', 'most', 'renowned', 'making', 'very', 'public', 'defense', 'Immaculate', 'Conception', 'Blessed', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'taking', 'even', 'thoughts', 'teachings', 'great', 'Doctor', 'Church', 'Saint', 'Thomas', 'Aquinas.The', 'Immaculate', 'Conception', 'was', 'actually', 'hotly', 'debated', 'topic', 'had', 'supporters', 'detractors', 'Even', 'greatest', 'devotee', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'St.', 'Bernard', 'Clairvaux', 'belonged', 'latter', 'group', 'Hence', 'get', 'picture', 'man', 'lots', 'guts', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'debate', 'teachings', 'great', 'philosophers', 'theologians', 'time.His', 'motivation', 'love', 'truth', 'study', 'united', 'Crucified', 'Christ', 'great', 'love', 'Eucharist', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'charity', 'neighbor.To', 'paraphrase', 'part', 'dialogue', 'film', 'Blessed', 'Scotus', 'protege', 'William', 'study', 'being', 'united', 'Crucified', 'Christ', 'not', 'worth', 'anything', 'could', 'lead', 'ruin', 'united', 'Him', 'true', 'Wisdom', 'Peace', 'FANTASTIC', 'Eventually', 'teaching', 'would', 'form', 'basis', 'declaration', 'Dogma', 'Immaculate', 'Conception', 'was', 'proclaimed', '1854.All', 'magnificently', 'portrayed', 'film.Along', 'most', 'beautiful', 'backdrops', 'ancient', 'monasteries', 'rolling', 'fields', 'mixed', 'deep', 'provoking', 'thoughts', 'Christian', 'teaching', 'Truly', 'viewer', 'feels', 'student', 'transported', 'time', 'witnessing', 'lectures', 'intellectual', 'debates', 'abound', 'film', 'would', 'deeply', 'benefit', 'sagacity', 'dialogue', 'be', 'forewarned', '..the', 'main', 'aspect', 'film', 'teachings', 'dialogue', 'hence', 'one', 'must', 'watch', 'film', 'rapt', 'attention', 'Even', 'missing', 'one', 'line', 'would', 'seem', 'losing', 'treasure', 'trove', 'very', 'profound', 'so', 'might', 'be', 'who', 'just', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'dull.The', 'running', 'time', 'movie', '90', 'minutes', 'Italian', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'trailer', 'movie.As', 'movies', 'Ignatius', 'press', 'DVD', 'booklet', 'rather', 'thin', 'one', '8', 'pages', 'great', 'stills', 'film', 'contents', 'are', 'follows:1', 'film.2', 'Comments', 'Director3', 'life', 'thoughts', 'Blessed', 'Duns', 'Scotus4', 'Theology', 'Scotus5', 'Immaculate', 'Conception6', 'Praise', 'Scotus', 'Pope', 'Benedict', 'XVI7', 'Scene', 'SelectionsA', 'big', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'monastery', 'bit', 'dark', 'However', 'necessary', 'ambiance', 'appreciate', 'times', 'place.It', 'noteworthy', 'film', 'won', '2', 'awards', 'Mirabile', 'Dictu', 'International', 'Catholic', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Best', 'Film', 'Best', 'Actor', 'OK', 'OK', '.so', 'not', 'Oscars', '..', '.This', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'official', 'film', 'World', 'Youth', 'Day', '2011', 'was', 'held', 'Madrid', 'Spain.To', 'conclude', 'are', 'devoted', 'Blessed', 'Mother', 'are', 'just', 'religious', 'movie', 'junkie', '..this', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buy', 'end', 'note', 'Lady', 'Immaculate', 'Conception', 'patroness', 'USA', 'Hence', 'will', 'serve', 'aid', 'meditation', 'especially', 'feast', 'day', '8th', 'December', 'year', 'next', 'Thursday']",Blessed Duns Scotus: Defender of the Immaculate Conception

1496779,A3QUTLN2YLW30Z,B005OT3FWC,Thomas Zabiega,"[1, 1]","This is a very entertaining movie, but one that does not make the mistake of dumbing down the personality and intellect of the person it is trying to portray, in this case Blessed Duns Scotus, next to Saint Thomas Aquinas possibly the greatest philosopher of the Middle Ages.  This movie shows Duns Scotus as a simple, down-to-earth, holy yet non-judgmental, highly intelligent and wise young professor who explains his philosophy and theology very clearly and precisely.  Though sometimes the subtitles go by too fast and one has to rewind to reread the text at some of the more difficult moments, this is actually not a defect.  The fact is that when one reads what Duns Scotus is explaining about what could be quite difficult areas, he does so in a way that most Christians could understand it.  The explanation of the Immaculate Conception and Assumption by Duns Scotus could actually persuade many non-Catholics about these dogmas of the Church.  I think anyone with a high school education could understand what is said in this movie.  Though not filled with action scenes, the movie is not boring, it flows very nicely, there is some interesting drama, and the good nature of Duns Scotus also makes for some amusing scenes.  A movie that every Catholic should watch and others should see as well to get a clear and concise explanation of Catholic teachings and what great saints are all about:  brilliant people who are at the same time child-like in their humility.",5,Amazing movie which explains theology better than most,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,1474,"['very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'one', 'not', 'make', 'mistake', 'dumbing', 'down', 'personality', 'intellect', 'person', 'trying', 'portray', 'case', 'Blessed', 'Duns', 'Scotus', 'next', 'Saint', 'Thomas', 'Aquinas', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'philosopher', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'movie', 'Duns', 'Scotus', 'simple', 'down-to-earth', 'holy', 'yet', 'non-judgmental', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'wise', 'young', 'professor', 'who', 'philosophy', 'theology', 'very', 'clearly', 'precisely', 'sometimes', 'subtitles', 'go', 'too', 'fast', 'one', 'rewind', 'reread', 'text', 'more', 'difficult', 'moments', 'actually', 'not', 'defect', 'fact', 'when', 'one', 'what', 'Duns', 'Scotus', 'explaining', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'difficult', 'areas', 'so', 'way', 'most', 'Christians', 'could', 'understand', 'explanation', 'Immaculate', 'Conception', 'Assumption', 'Duns', 'Scotus', 'could', 'actually', 'persuade', 'many', 'non-Catholics', 'dogmas', 'Church', 'think', 'anyone', 'high', 'school', 'education', 'could', 'understand', 'what', 'said', 'movie', 'not', 'filled', 'action', 'scenes', 'movie', 'not', 'boring', 'very', 'nicely', 'interesting', 'drama', 'good', 'nature', 'Duns', 'Scotus', 'also', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Catholic', 'should', 'watch', 'others', 'should', 'see', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'clear', 'concise', 'explanation', 'Catholic', 'teachings', 'what', 'great', 'saints', 'are', 'brilliant', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'same', 'time', 'child-like', 'humility']",Blessed Duns Scotus: Defender of the Immaculate Conception
1496780,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B005OT3FWC,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","This brief (subtitled) Italian film depicts a key phase in the life of Bl. Duns Scotus, a Scottish medieval theologian ranked with St. Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham among the greatest scholastic philosophers. The emphasis is on this Franciscan friar's defense of the hypothesis that Mary the mother of Jesus was conceived without original sin, a dogma now known in Catholicism as the Immaculate Conception. His opponents in the theological debate depicted here are the Dominicans, who always make reliable villains in films due to their close association with the Inquisition. (I've never seen a film about a good or saintly Dominican!)Filmed on location in Europe, the film was made by a small Franciscan order, and is replete with authentic costumes and sets.What's great about this movie is that it really brings the medieval university world to life, giving us a vivid depiction of what it was like to live in a world where theological hypotheses were judged by public disputation, frequently paving the way for new doctrinal and dogmatic positions decrees of the Catholic Church. In one of the few areas of theology where history awarded the victory to Scotus, St. Thomas Aquinas (dead by the time of this film's setting) actually opposed the idea of the Immaculate Conception, which wasn't formally defined as dogma until 1950. While all of these things might sound like the makings of a dull movie, there is surprising potency and vibrancy in the medieval politics and forensic maneuverings of this film's plot, and there are some lightly fictionalized human interest sidebars to keep things from getting too stale. This movie is the closest thing I've ever seen to an accurate depiction of medieval university life on film: I highly recommend it for all lovers of history, theology, philosophy, and biography.",5,Scholastic philosophy comes to life,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,1824,"['brief', 'subtitled', 'Italian', 'film', 'key', 'phase', 'life', 'Bl', 'Duns', 'Scotus', 'Scottish', 'medieval', 'theologian', 'ranked', 'St.', 'Thomas', 'Aquinas', 'William', 'Ockham', 'greatest', 'scholastic', 'philosophers', 'emphasis', 'Franciscan', 'friar', 'defense', 'hypothesis', 'Mary', 'mother', 'Jesus', 'was', 'conceived', 'original', 'sin', 'dogma', 'now', 'known', 'Catholicism', 'Immaculate', 'Conception', 'opponents', 'theological', 'debate', 'depicted', 'here', 'are', 'Dominicans', 'who', 'always', 'make', 'reliable', 'villains', 'films', 'due', 'close', 'association', 'Inquisition', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'good', 'saintly', 'Dominican', 'Filmed', 'location', 'Europe', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'small', 'Franciscan', 'order', 'replete', 'authentic', 'costumes', 'great', 'movie', 'really', 'medieval', 'university', 'world', 'life', 'giving', 'vivid', 'depiction', 'what', 'was', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'theological', 'hypotheses', 'were', 'judged', 'public', 'disputation', 'frequently', 'paving', 'way', 'new', 'doctrinal', 'dogmatic', 'positions', 'decrees', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'one', 'few', 'areas', 'theology', 'where', 'history', 'awarded', 'victory', 'Scotus', 'St.', 'Thomas', 'Aquinas', 'dead', 'time', 'film', 'setting', 'actually', 'opposed', 'idea', 'Immaculate', 'Conception', 'was', ""n't"", 'formally', 'defined', 'dogma', '1950', 'things', 'might', 'sound', 'makings', 'dull', 'movie', 'surprising', 'potency', 'vibrancy', 'medieval', 'politics', 'forensic', 'maneuverings', 'film', 'plot', 'are', 'lightly', 'fictionalized', 'human', 'interest', 'sidebars', 'keep', 'things', 'getting', 'too', 'stale', 'movie', 'closest', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'medieval', 'university', 'life', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'lovers', 'history', 'theology', 'philosophy', 'biography']",Blessed Duns Scotus: Defender of the Immaculate Conception
1496781,A3H387SM7ALRVO,B005OT3FWC,"William Erickson ""HoyaMovieLover""","[1, 1]","John Duns Scotus is my favorite philosoper, medieval and otherwise.  He lived, all too briefly, at the dawn of one of the most creative, destructive, and tragic eras of human history: the 14th century, which Barbara Tuchman called ""a distant mirror"" to the 20th Century, but it was certainly much worse.This is an excellent film, which I really enjoyed, but it's probably not to everyone's taste.  But even if it isn't, ""Blessed Duns Scotus"" is worth watching for its own sake and because it tells the story of a great thinker who has been written off by history as the original ""dunce""  -- the term is based on his name.  If you liked ""The Name of the Rose,"" you'll probably like this, but don't expect a murder mystery, because there ain't none.  It's just the story of a very humble, spiritual, and brilliant man, just like William of Baskerville in The Name of the Rose, but without the 007 attributes.Duns Scotus's intellect was so fertile that it's impossible to convey the full extent of his work.  His ideas about univocity of being, formal distinction (distinctio formalis a parte rei), and thisness (haecceitas) are fascinating and, well, totally appropriate for the ""Doctor Subtilis,"" as he became known in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.  However, if you're looking for those topics in this film, you won't find them.  But not to worry.  The film pursues several other important Scotist themes: the primacy of the will over the intellect, the primacy of the spirit over worldliness (church over the state), the possibility of alternate universes, and, most importantly in this film, the doctrine of Immaculate Conception, which consumes at least a third of the film.  And no, Immaculate Conception has nothing to do with sex.  It's all about Original Sin, which tarnishes every descendant of Adam and Eve except for ""Mary without spot,"" to quote the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. (The sleeve notes are excellent.)  The point, as I understand it, is that the Son of God could not have been born of a woman stained with Original Sin.  So, God, in his infinite power (and love), relieved Mary of that burden, and He may have done so even after Mary was born, simply because He can. Pretty heavy stuff.There is a minor love story in the film (this is NOT a spoiler alert) that some viewers have considered superfluous.  But IMO, the love story plays an important part in the story, as you'll see when John gives away his worldly possessions (books) to his students, and when he is in prayer in the midst of the Immaculate Conception debate.  That scene wouldn't work otherwise.  John's genuine humility and Christian charity shine throughout.Warning to Anglophone viewers: DO NOT WATCH THE ENGLISH VERSION.  (Or, should I say AMERICAN VERSION?)  Instead, watch the Italian version with English captions.  Unfortunately, the captions flash by very quickly, so you may need to pause the video to allow yourself to absorb what was just said. But the Italian dialogue is beautiful so it's worth it.  The American version, in harsh contrast, sounds like it was voiced over by porn stars between... um... takes.  I mean, at one point the name ""Aquinas"" is pronounced ""aqueeness.""  Please.  The American version is so atrocious that it approaches low comedy, which, needless to say, was not the intent of the filmmaker.  So please watch the Italian version!!!!!Philosophy digression alert: Duns Scotus and the ""realists"" were certainly winners in their metaphysics debate with the ""nominalists,"" such as Ockham.  ""Horseness"" is real, even if it turned out to be atomistic, in the form of DNA.  Species are real, and not merely concepts as the nominalists wrongly argued.Computer-geek digression alert:  Duns Scotus was IMO the original object-oriented designer.  In C++, C#, Java, and other OO languages, software ""objects"" are classes that have been ""instantiated"" -- a very Scotist term!.  In the software code, the actual objects are referred to as ""this.""  Duns Scotus said that what gives individual beings both their essence and existence is a certain quality, which, interestingly enough, he called ""thisness"" (haecceitas). Now, for OO programmers, ""thisness"" is simply the combination of the class (properties and behaviors) PLUS the particular data about the instance, such as physical dimensions, skin color, social security number, #hashcode, etc.  In Duns Scotus's case, however, I think the data that filled out the object included things both natural AND supernatural (the Soul, one's capacity for Grace, etc.).  He definitely sees the Great Chain of Being as being ""top down,"" just as we children of Smalltalk see it: a hierarchy of derived class after derived class, all derived from a single abstract base class (Being), each with its own inherited or modified (overriden) properties, behaviors, and actual implementations of pure virtual functions, and, of course, thisness, which makes each instantiation (individual) unique.",5,Medieval philosophy ROCKS!
