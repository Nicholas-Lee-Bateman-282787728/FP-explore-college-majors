Cathey ""ParsifalCSA""","[3, 3]","BUCHANAN RIDES ALONE is an underrated Scott-Boetticher issue, book ended by the higher regarded RIDE LONESOME and COMANCHE STATION. Yet, on repeated viewing this disarmingly playful creation holds up very well, in fact, grows in appeal, its superb qualities becoming more apparent. Boetticher and Randy Scott have everything right: the playfulness is never forced nor overblown. Scott, not known for his comedy roles, proves that he has a real knack for a delightfully studied, quizzical, humor. There is also a hint of sarcasm at times, but, again, it never becomes dominant. The supporting cast acts truly as an ensemble, playing off each other, leaving Scott, at times, to be an amused bystander. But he's never out of the unfolding action. In all, this is a highly satisfying film that repays repeated viewing. It deserves a higher position in the Boetticher canon.",5,Underrated Scott-Boetticher masterpiece,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,869,"['BUCHANAN', 'RIDES', 'ALONE', 'underrated', 'Scott-Boetticher', 'issue', 'book', 'ended', 'higher', 'regarded', 'RIDE', 'LONESOME', 'COMANCHE', 'STATION', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'disarmingly', 'playful', 'creation', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'fact', 'appeal', 'superb', 'qualities', 'becoming', 'more', 'apparent', 'Boetticher', 'Randy', 'Scott', 'have', 'everything', 'right', 'playfulness', 'never', 'forced', 'overblown', 'Scott', 'not', 'known', 'comedy', 'roles', 'real', 'knack', 'delightfully', 'studied', 'quizzical', 'humor', 'also', 'hint', 'sarcasm', 'times', 'again', 'never', 'dominant', 'supporting', 'cast', 'acts', 'truly', 'ensemble', 'playing', 'off', 'other', 'leaving', 'Scott', 'times', 'be', 'amused', 'bystander', 'never', 'unfolding', 'action', 'highly', 'satisfying', 'film', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'higher', 'position', 'Boetticher', 'canon']",Buchanan Rides Alone

The story was good, but Scott seemed not himself. He sometimes smiled unnecessarily. The film did not give an adequate history of who he was. He seemed shiftless, without purpose. His clothing did not fit what we generally like to see our heroes wear; his hat seemed somewhat ridiculous, as if he had no one to advise him what to wear. Even his movements seemed wrong. Although he was one of the producers of the film, I got the impression that his heart was not in it.",3,I did not lke this film as much as I wanted to like it,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,588,"['am', 'fan', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'films', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'understated', 'extent', 'felt', 'weak', 'camp', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'Scott', 'seemed', 'not', 'sometimes', 'smiled', 'unnecessarily', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'adequate', 'history', 'who', 'was', 'seemed', 'shiftless', 'purpose', 'clothing', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'what', 'generally', 'like', 'see', 'heroes', 'wear', 'hat', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'ridiculous', 'had', 'one', 'advise', 'what', 'wear', 'Even', 'movements', 'seemed', 'wrong', 'was', 'one', 'producers', 'film', 'got', 'impression', 'heart', 'was', 'not']",Buchanan Rides Alone
1586307,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B0096PBD7E,Muzzlehatch,"[0, 0]","A dusty border town...Buchanan rides across, from Mexico into Agry Town, California, and into a mess of trouble. The music (can it be coincidence?) echoes the sweeping romantic melody at the heart of ""The Tall T"", but ""Buchanan"", like the previous ""Decision at Sundown"" is anything but romantic or wistful. Right away we know that we're in a corrupt and dangerous place -- the sheriff who sits right by the border seems to be waiting for any excuse to deal harshly with people crossing - and to take anything he deems ""contraband"" himself. Traveler Buchanan (Randolph Scott) apparently has nothing, and so is allowed to go.He stops at a hotel to get a room - $10 (a lot of money in the post-Civil War west) from the fat and kind of stupid-looking yokel behind the desk, whose name happens to be Agry - same as the fat sheriff and the as-yet-unmet fat Judge who is running for senator, both his brothers. The Agrys rule the town and extract a high price from strangers - a steak and a whisky are also $10 apiece for apparently well-off Buchanan at the Agry's saloon across the street. Our hero is challenged, apparently for no reason, right away by a drunken young lout, but after one-punching him the older, easygoing Buchanan ignores his potential danger. Soon it will come for him, as the young man gets killed in a gunfight and Buchanan ends up on the (apparently) wrong side with his killer, a young Mexican with a personal grudge.This 4th entry in the cycle of westerns directed by Budd Boetticher and starring Randolph Scott, and second to be written by Charles Lang (from a novel by pulp writer Jonas Ward who wrote dozens of Buchanan novels), seems for a while to be every bit as cynical as the previous Lang-written film. Like ""Decision at Sundown"" this is set mostly in town, and like that film Scott's character is partnered up for most of the picture, this time with the young Mexican who turns out to be Juan de la Vega, son of a famous Mexican hero who Buchanan greatly admires. A good chunk of time is spent in jail, about to be hanged (the sheriff is angling for a hanging as it's helped his popularity) or being ridden off out of town to be killed. Of course our hero manages to get out of these debacles and, rather unwittingly it turns out, manages to pit the greedy and ambitious sheriff Lew Agry (Barry Kelley) against his equally ambitious and money-hungry brother, Judge Simon (Tol Avery). Ultimately what keeps this film from descending into the same darkness that ""Decision"" ended up in is the presence of several positive characters - Juan and his father's lieutenant Gomez, Carbo (who while somewhat the player himself is nevertheless more honorable than any of the brothers) and the virtuous Buchanan himself.Overall this is funnier and a little less intense than the others in the series, though no lower in quality. Scott has a smile on his face almost the whole time; there are no women to speak of in the film; and there are several admirable characters who live through to the end. I'm not sure this gave me much to chew on, though again there's that distrust of authority, the corruption of the law that features in the previous Lang-written feature also. All in all, just a great rousing bit of fun.  This Sony disc is essentially the same thing as the print that appears onThe Films of Budd Boetticher; if you're interested in the series at all, that's the set to get, but if you only want this film, I can warmly recommend this single.",5,There ain't no place like West Texas,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,3472,"['dusty', 'border', 'town', 'Buchanan', 'Mexico', 'Agry', 'Town', 'California', 'mess', 'trouble', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'coincidence', 'sweeping', 'romantic', 'melody', 'heart', 'Tall', 'T', 'Buchanan', 'previous', 'Decision', 'Sundown', 'anything', 'romantic', 'wistful', 'Right', 'away', 'know', ""'re"", 'corrupt', 'dangerous', 'place', 'sheriff', 'who', 'right', 'border', 'be', 'waiting', 'excuse', 'deal', 'harshly', 'people', 'crossing', 'take', 'anything', 'contraband', 'Traveler', 'Buchanan', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'apparently', 'nothing', 'so', 'allowed', 'go.He', 'stops', 'hotel', 'get', 'room', '10', 'lot', 'money', 'post-Civil', 'War', 'west', 'fat', 'kind', 'stupid-looking', 'yokel', 'desk', 'name', 'be', 'Agry', 'same', 'fat', 'sheriff', 'as-yet-unmet', 'fat', 'Judge', 'who', 'running', 'senator', 'brothers', 'Agrys', 'rule', 'town', 'extract', 'high', 'price', 'strangers', 'steak', 'whisky', 'are', 'also', '10', 'apiece', 'apparently', 'well-off', 'Buchanan', 'Agry', 'saloon', 'street', 'hero', 'challenged', 'apparently', 'reason', 'right', 'away', 'drunken', 'young', 'lout', 'one-punching', 'older', 'easygoing', 'Buchanan', 'potential', 'danger', 'Soon', 'will', 'come', 'young', 'man', 'killed', 'gunfight', 'Buchanan', 'up', 'apparently', 'wrong', 'side', 'killer', 'young', 'Mexican', 'personal', 'grudge.This', '4th', 'entry', 'cycle', 'westerns', 'directed', 'Budd', 'Boetticher', 'starring', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'second', 'be', 'written', 'Charles', 'Lang', 'novel', 'pulp', 'writer', 'Jonas', 'Ward', 'who', 'wrote', 'dozens', 'Buchanan', 'novels', 'while', 'be', 'bit', 'as', 'cynical', 'previous', 'Lang-written', 'film', 'Decision', 'Sundown', 'set', 'mostly', 'town', 'film', 'Scott', 'character', 'partnered', 'up', 'most', 'picture', 'time', 'young', 'Mexican', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Juan', 'de', 'la', 'Vega', 'son', 'famous', 'Mexican', 'hero', 'who', 'Buchanan', 'greatly', 'good', 'chunk', 'time', 'spent', 'jail', 'be', 'hanged', 'sheriff', 'angling', 'hanging', 'helped', 'popularity', 'being', 'ridden', 'off', 'town', 'be', 'killed', 'course', 'hero', 'get', 'debacles', 'rather', 'unwittingly', 'out', 'pit', 'greedy', 'ambitious', 'sheriff', 'Lew', 'Agry', 'Barry', 'Kelley', 'equally', 'ambitious', 'money-hungry', 'brother', 'Judge', 'Simon', 'Tol', 'Avery', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'film', 'descending', 'same', 'darkness', 'Decision', 'ended', 'up', 'presence', 'several', 'positive', 'characters', 'Juan', 'father', 'lieutenant', 'Gomez', 'Carbo', 'who', 'somewhat', 'player', 'nevertheless', 'more', 'honorable', 'brothers', 'virtuous', 'Buchanan', 'himself.Overall', 'funnier', 'little', 'less', 'intense', 'others', 'series', 'lower', 'quality', 'Scott', 'smile', 'face', 'almost', 'whole', 'time', 'are', 'women', 'speak', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'admirable', 'characters', 'who', 'live', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'gave', 'much', 'chew', 'though', 'again', 'distrust', 'authority', 'corruption', 'law', 'previous', 'Lang-written', 'feature', 'also', 'just', 'great', 'rousing', 'bit', 'fun', 'Sony', 'disc', 'essentially', 'same', 'thing', 'print', 'onThe', 'Films', 'Budd', 'Boetticher', ""'re"", 'interested', 'series', 'set', 'get', 'only', 'want', 'film', 'can', 'warmly', 'recommend', 'single']",Buchanan Rides Alone

I very much like Ride Lonesome... but ""Buchanan Rides Alone"" has got to be the worse conversion of a Jonas Ward novel I've ever seen.Buchanan was always a bit of a 'bull in a china shop' gunny but this film portrays him as just plain 'stupid.' The action is ""only"" unpredictable because of that foolishness and the scenarios depicted are so improbable as to be ludicrous.Yes, it is filmed clearly and all the horses look nice but Randolph Scott (one of my favorite actors) is, as someone else mentioned, off the mark and 'way' off the mark in ""this"" effort as a savvy gunman.
