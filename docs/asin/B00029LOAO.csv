There was a young lady who starred (only periferally in Lassie) in both that caught my eye, and whom I have never forgotten. Her name? Elizabeth Taylor. Back when we didn't need a bunch of bureaucrats to tell us whether we could safely take our kids to a movie, back when I was the kid, stories had a heartwarming quality to them -- as these two do. Lassie also has a great classic actor from back then, George Robertson Justice in a relatively minor role, and a cameo appearance of an actor who started in silent movies, and had the opportunity to do a true star turn in Lassie, Edmund Gwenn. Folks younger than me might remember him as the ""I Like To Laugh"" guy in Mary Poppins. Sharing the lead in National Velvet is Mickey Rooney. Imagine -- Mickey Rooney as a child star!

When a hurricane hits their island, Porter Rick's (Chuck Connors) book is destroyed and he must head to the mainland to get it fixed.Sandy, meanwhile, accompanies his friend Kim (Connie Scott) on a fun filled day of swimming and fishing.  The day ends on a sad note when a dolphin gets hit with a spear.  Even though it is badly hurt, Sandy can't stand to see it killed, so he brings it home and nurses it back to health.  But what will his dad say when he returns?This is the movie that first introduced us to Flipper.  From here, he'd get another movie and his own TV show.  It's interesting to see how things developed from here.  Luke Halpin is the only actor to make it to the TV show.  Porter Rick was recast, and his mother (yes, he has one here) was completely eliminated.  Also, younger brother Bud is no where to be found here.That aside, how does the film do as a movie?  To be honest, it is okay at best.  The action is rather slow.  Heck, we're about half way in before Flipper even shows up.  The early parts focus on the hurricane and how the community survives.  Of course, it doesn't help that the story is predictable.  And the acting is mediocre at best.  It gets the job done, but at times it is pretty weak.I must admit, I was disappointed with this movie.
