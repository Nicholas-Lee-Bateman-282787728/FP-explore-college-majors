1531092,A3W3LP0RSWLJCS,B007I1Q4W2,Annihilatrix1138,"[1, 1]","When it comes to zombie films, there's only the basic scenario to set them apart and sometimes that's where the differences end. And then you have films that try to completely embrace their respective setting, and try to make a good movie in the process. DAWN OF THE DEAD embraced its critique of commercialism as its characters survived in a mall, THE WALKING DEAD embraced its southern setting, tackling racism, religion, etc. EXIT HUMANITY, begins just after the Civil War has come to a close, with a man coming home to find his family taken by the walking dead. Alone and still reeling from the atrocities he experienced during the war, he decided to make one last journey in an attempt to find peace.EXIT HUMANITY is not tongue-in-cheek and doesn't know the meaning of humor; this is a very dramatic take on a zombie infestation in post-war Tennessee. That in itself might sound a bit silly, but the filmmakers rightly keep the focus on the story, its characters, and the human drama that would emerge from such a situation. It really does take more inspiration from zombie stories of a more ""serious"" tone like THE WALKING DEAD.But unlike THE WALKING DEAD, EXIT HUMANITY arguably plays things safe. It doesn't fully embrace its setting as much as it should have, perhaps. It makes no mention of slavery, neither is there a strong connection to the war itself. For as serious as this film was attempting to be, it draws a line in a very unlikely place.All that aside, for an independent zombie film, the production qualities are top notch. The characters are well-acted and easy to care about, the zombie effects are very good, and the locations, costumes and weapons are authentic. The film is also narrated by Brian Cox, who does a fantastic job throughout. (No surprise.) All in all, this is just a tremendous film for the budget that it had, and the filmmakers deserve all kinds of praise for getting the very most out of what they had to work with.There are many, many zombie movies out there, but I'd argue that this is perhaps one of the best in recent years. It walks the line between being too serious at times (the main character's penchant for screaming in torment nearly a dozen times was a tad off-putting), and not serious enough (ignoring the aftermath of the Civil War in a lot of respects). But regardless, EXIT HUMANITY clearly had a lot of love and talent behind it. If you're a fan of the zombie genre, this will likely be a refreshing change of pace. Personally, I wouldn't mind a sequel.",4,Postbellum Undead,1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,2514,"['When', 'zombie', 'films', 'only', 'basic', 'scenario', 'set', 'apart', 'where', 'differences', 'end', 'then', 'have', 'films', 'try', 'completely', 'embrace', 'respective', 'setting', 'try', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'process', 'DAWN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'embraced', 'critique', 'commercialism', 'characters', 'survived', 'mall', 'THE', 'WALKING', 'DEAD', 'embraced', 'southern', 'setting', 'tackling', 'racism', 'religion', 'etc', 'EXIT', 'HUMANITY', 'just', 'Civil', 'War', 'come', 'close', 'man', 'coming', 'home', 'find', 'family', 'taken', 'walking', 'dead', 'Alone', 'still', 'reeling', 'atrocities', 'experienced', 'war', 'decided', 'make', 'one', 'last', 'journey', 'attempt', 'find', 'peace.EXIT', 'HUMANITY', 'not', 'tongue-in-cheek', ""n't"", 'know', 'meaning', 'humor', 'very', 'dramatic', 'take', 'zombie', 'infestation', 'post-war', 'Tennessee', 'might', 'sound', 'bit', 'silly', 'filmmakers', 'rightly', 'keep', 'focus', 'story', 'characters', 'human', 'drama', 'would', 'emerge', 'such', 'situation', 'really', 'take', 'more', 'inspiration', 'zombie', 'stories', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'THE', 'WALKING', 'DEAD.But', 'THE', 'WALKING', 'DEAD', 'EXIT', 'HUMANITY', 'arguably', 'things', 'safe', ""n't"", 'fully', 'embrace', 'setting', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'have', 'perhaps', 'mention', 'slavery', 'there', 'strong', 'connection', 'war', 'as', 'serious', 'film', 'was', 'attempting', 'be', 'line', 'very', 'unlikely', 'place.All', 'aside', 'independent', 'zombie', 'film', 'production', 'qualities', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'characters', 'are', 'well-acted', 'easy', 'care', 'zombie', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'locations', 'costumes', 'weapons', 'are', 'authentic', 'film', 'also', 'narrated', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'who', 'fantastic', 'job', 'surprise', 'just', 'tremendous', 'film', 'budget', 'had', 'filmmakers', 'deserve', 'kinds', 'praise', 'getting', 'very', 'most', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'with.There', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'zombie', 'movies', 'there', ""'d"", 'argue', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'recent', 'years', 'walks', 'line', 'being', 'too', 'serious', 'times', 'main', 'character', 'penchant', 'screaming', 'torment', 'nearly', 'dozen', 'times', 'was', 'tad', 'off-putting', 'not', 'serious', 'enough', 'ignoring', 'aftermath', 'Civil', 'War', 'lot', 'respects', 'regardless', 'EXIT', 'HUMANITY', 'clearly', 'had', 'lot', 'love', 'talent', ""'re"", 'fan', 'zombie', 'genre', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'Personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sequel']",N/A

A lone warrior is left to carve a new life in this twisted new world, but he will find even more to fear in the other surviving humans than in the walking dead. John Geddes' ambitious period piece reshapes the history of the walking dead in EXIT HUMANITY. Not only is the film beautifully shot and finely dressed in its best wartime attire, but it also provides powerful performances by its leading cast members Mark Gibson and Adam Seybold. Geddes spends his time carefully crafting his characters without feeling the need to rush either the action or gore, an encouraging trait that is shared with television's The Walking Dead. This allows for a clear emotional rapport with our lead that is carried on through the end of his journey. Bill Moseley joins the cast as the disillusioned General Williams, along with Dee Wallace and Stephen McHattie in other supporting roles.

There are a handful of horror legends knocking around in this movie and ... it just falls flat. The zombie makeup is ok, but a BIT much (very white, very THICK) The acting is so-so but the narration is SOOOOO distracting and unnecessary. It is almost as distracting and unnecessary as the incessant soundtrack! There is only one song (the slow banjo one) the hits the proper tone for the movie. The rest just sounds thrown together and distracting. It is almost as if they COULD have done a great job on the soundtrack, but instead they wanted it done in a week so the just did it. The same could be said for the plot. You really want to get behind the story because it does have a whole lot of potential, but it just seems like they are going through the motions and trying to give you a story with the same emotional arc's that you are used to. Nothing will surprise you and nothing will grab your attention and hold it. By the halfway mark you are ready for this to be done ... not because it is terrible, mind you, but because its just not all that interesting. I just hate it when movies like this could be so much more, but they rush you through and give you a bunch of stock tricks. Why are these filmmakers in such a darned hurry anyway?

1531103,A1GA996JHP23Y3,B007I1Q4W2,Douglas Maclean,"[19, 26]","There are certain kinds of stories used in movies that become so popular that they pass the tipping point plunging into the hackney. Among the myriad of genres available to the screenwriters the one most prone to overuse is found in the realm of horror flicks. Even in that sliver of filmmaking there are slices that have become overused for example the slasher flick. Without a doubt another has to be the zombie horde. The ravaging mass on staggering undead has become exceptionally popular in some rather unusual ways. People dress up as zombies and normal going out into the night on `zombie' crawls' acting out scenarios of doom on the city streets. A very popular television series featuring these `Walking Dead' demonstrates that this kind of story is far from being played out, there are still aspects that can be discovered if the filmmaker has the insight and talent new twists on the zombie film can still be had. Considering the undead has been a staple of horror films since the thirties when most were the result of intervention of a practitioner of the occult forbidden arts of voodoo. Since George Romero reinvented zombies as social commentary theses rotting corpses have had the potential for innovative plot lines as well as some of the worse quick and cheap independent movies. Fortunately for devotees of movies there are still creative filmmakers willing to think out of the box. John Geddes happens to be one such auteurs and his latest opus, `Exit Humanity' demonstrates that this old dog has a few new tricks left. He is part of a new vanguard of horror masters that has looked into history for a setting; transplanting the familiar creatures of death into a well known historical setting, the Civil War. He is among the first to proceed on this tangent but the trend seems to be growing. Many `steam punk' stories are based in this turbulent time in our country's history as well as a recent action horror film that turns Abraham Lincoln into a vampire slayer. Mr. Geddes pulls back in time to an era when there was certainly no shortage of fresh courses just waiting for reanimation. I was hesitant when I read the synopsis on the screener but within minutes of watching the film I found myself enthralled, my attention affixed to the screen, realizing I was watching something special.There is a certain fascination that many Americans hold for the bloodiest war ever fought on our soil, the Civil War or as some in the Deep South continue to refer to it, `The War of Northern Aggression'. The summer is an appropriate time to turn our attention to this conflict as July Forth does mark the anniversary of the most costly battle in the war, Gettysburg. This film immediately draws the audience into the brutal violence of the time by opening with an all out battle scene. We see a familiar sight for war buffs and frequent viewers of the History Channel, battle weary men clad in the grey and blue of their respective nations clashing in mortal combat. Then, slowly we notice there is a third force merging into the fray; a sizable force of zombies. Rather that commit a lot of film to a prolonged explanation this scene economically defines the foundation of this alternate universe. Socioeconomic fight that lead to dividing the nation has been settled on the battlefield but now as the two sides attempt to heal and rebuild the battle lines are once again drawn. Instead of policy and geography determining you allegiance it is now a bitter struggle for the living to defend against the ravenous host of the decaying undead.The film continues to renovate persistent tropes by updating the `found footage' motif. True to a period appropriate story telling the video footage has been replaced by recently located journal. This provides an intimate first person account through the personal experiences of the narrator, Edward Young (Mark Gibson). Innovations like this are accumulated stacking one layer upon another creating a solid foundation for the story. With such a fanciful departure from both the classic Civil War film and the traditional zombie flick. If fans of either kind of flick complain about the mixture or divergence from the typical then you can be certain they have not seen this movie. It is not uncommon for a story set in this period to feature a man who lost his wife and son but once again the construction of the plot surrounds the anticipated character archetype and places him in a totally novel set of circumstances.It is one thing to use a journal as a prop to ease into narration as the written word gives way to dialogue but Mr. Geddes takes things a step further. Common to the journals of the period Edward accompanied his words with numerous drawings of the people and circumstances he encountered in his life. As the camera focuses o one of these sketches the audience is whisked into the depicted scene becoming a firsthand observer of the story. This is simply put brilliant adding an immediacy and intimacy to the film that is usually lacking particularly in a movie featuring decaying antagonists.I found myself compelled to watch this film several times, with each viewing is discovered yet another layer with nuances I had not yet explored. It has been a very long time since I felt that way about a horror film. Much of this is derived by the m&eacute;lange offered up by the director. He is relatively new to his craft as writer and director with one previous feature to his credit, `Scarce'. There he took on the standard horror ploy of isolation. I look forward to obtaining a copy to add to what I am certain will become a growing collection of this artist's work. The drawings slip into period style animation before finally morphing into live action. This enhances the overall effect of transporting the audience back in time to witness the travails of this simple solider. In all this film is rich in detail with but a few technical missteps. Fir something made on a miniscule budget it is the epitome of the independent film; talent, innovation and art over the overwhelming need for box office.",4,Night of the Living Dead meets

The low budget shows.  Most of the acting is at best serviceable, and at worst makes the opposite but equally annoying mistakes of being too wooden or too hammy.  Plus, the drawls and accents seemed to slide all over the place.But those limitations aside, ""Exit"" gets the ""for-free"" stuff mostly right--by which I mean creativity, dedication, enthusiasm, storytelling, originality...the vision part that one either brings to a film or not, and that cannot be bought at any price (I give you ""Battleship,"" a thin but expensive reworking of ""Transformer"" tropes).  For filmmakers who actually care about their creations, this stuff can be gotten for free and elevate zero-budget movies to remarkable entertainments (I give youThe Blair Witch Project,Pi,Open Water, andPrimer). All that's required is a love of film and willingness to go a little gonzo.""Exit"" goes a little gonzo.Much of the movie actually is relatively familiar fare, but the setting (postbellum America), the characterizations, the backstories (especially how this zombie plague got rolling in the first place), the use of animation and flashbacks--it all adds up to a unique zombie movie experience. And that counts with me.  I've always loved the zombie sub-genre, and I have been encouraged in recent years to see just how far it can be stretched.  The walking dead have a lot to teach us about bigotry, isolation, consumerism, class warfare, courage, grief, mortality...yeah, the first job of any good zombie movie is to scare you and maybe gross you out, but beyond that, the best ones have something to say.I'm not sure ExACTLY what ""Exit Humanity"" was trying to say, but the IMPRESSION it left was of a man who, through incalcuable loss, had joined the dead figuratively (and wished to join them literally) and was brought back to vitality through meaningful projects, human relationships, and natural beauty.  I would say that while the movie was too long by 20 percent and could have dropped a subplot or two, tightening up its storyline to good effect, my patience through the pointless or slow parts was rewarded by a few tense scenes, some tasty revenge, and a satisfying conclusion.

Like Sissy Spacek gave a great and convincing performance, so did Mark Gibson as Edward Young in ""Exit to humanity"".  The excellent acting of the mourning-main character is what grabs you so quickly and then allows the brilliance of the script, writing, cinematography, direction and the mood of the film to carry and captivate you throughout and to the end.I dont know if i have ever seen such dynamite performances in a Zombie movie...ever. The original Dawn of the Dead.. 28 Days later, all had characters we had become attached to, but were we emotionally moved by them? I believe it was more so of a cheering and rooting-on of those characters. In ""Exit"" I became concerned as to how Edward Young would cope with his pain, and what wisdom he could obtain and give us, the viewer. So many fine performances form several actors including Dee Wallace who was exceptional.With strong atmosphere and make-up effects ""Edge"" showed greatness without the use of intense gore, something we expect from a Zombie movie, and tend to look forward to, but its absence in no way whatsoever took anything away from it. The soundtrack was top notch, and definitely a part of the equation to stir ones emotions along with the acting. The unique take and possible cause of the Zombie plague that has kept fans of the genre wondering, ""why?"", was well done. Also, i would never have thought that you could tell me a post Civil-War Tennessee zombie flick could be convincing by any means, but it utterly did, and i never questioned the period piece aspect of the film once during my viewing. I was captivated. I was moved. It has been quite some time since i have been more than just 'satisfied' with a horror flick... I was 'fulfilled'.

1531111,AAU5MAMZRRR80,B007I1Q4W2,John Milton,"[1, 1]","Forays into history and twisting the events found therein and giving them a horror slant is becoming incredibly popular. Author Seth Grahame- Smith leads the charge with such projects as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter; and his latest work Unholy Night, which is set to put a horror spin on the biblical tale of the Three Wise Men...I love historical horror romps, zombies and post-apocalyptica and so, Exit Humanity was naturally attractive to me.However, warily, I started to watch Exit Humanity and was almost immediately impressed when I was greeted by a narrative from Brian Cox (Braveheart, The Ring, Troy, Manhunter) and a brief battle scene from the American Civil War, with the addition of the undead!As opposed to many zombie/infected films, Exit Humanity does not rely on gore or flesh-rending scenes to pad out proceedings. In fact, Exit Humanity is very much about the lead character Edward Young and how he copes with the bleak events which he faces. Relative newcomer Mark Gibson (Monster Brawl, Psych) delivers a believable performance as Young and is ably supported throughout by Adam Seybold and Jordan Hayes (Nostrum, 2012's House at the end of the Street); and surprisingly, by horror regulars such as Bill Moseley as the maniacal General Williams (The Devil's Rejects, Army of Darkness, House of 1000 Corpses), Stephen McHattie (A Little Bit Zombie, Watchmen, Red: Werewolf Hunter) and a turn from an almost unrecognisable Dee Wallace (The Holwing, Cujo, Critters) who gives proceedings greater depth with her expository role.There were points during proceedings when this film could have veered off the precipice and become a straightforward action-horror. However, writer and director John Geddes has created something special with Exit Humanity and manages to marry up the performances of his actors, an appropriate score, quality special effects by The Brothers Gore (Jeff & Jason Derushie) and bleak, bleached footage perfectly to create an atmosphere that are absent from much larger projects, never mind a small independent film.At times, I was reminded of a number of different films, most notably The Outlaw Josey Wales. This may seem strange but I submit to you that Exit Humanity and Josey Wales both have as their central characters hardy men who are haunted by the events of their past and Exit Humanity does indeed have a kind of Western vibe to it.I loved Exit Humanity. It is an ambitious horror tale that does an incredible amount with a very modest budget. However, it won't be for everyone. I suspect that fans of the zombie sub-genre may be left a little disappointed since the pace of the film is distinctly more relaxed than your average undead/infected flick.

I can't believe this was a budget movie... I guess that just goes to show that as long as you got a talented and creative group of folks really dedicated to spending time and energy to their project, you don't have to have a gross amount of money support. It's really nice to actually be able to watch a movie where thought and time had been put into writing a script with believable dialogue. Not only was it an interesting story, but this movie had actors that could actually act (though there was a bit of over acting every now and again which seemed to make the movie overly melodramatic) and a prop and make-up department that actually knew what they were doing to pull off a somewhat historically accurate looking period piece with realistic looking walking dead!On the negative side, the movie was at times a little melodrama! Now don't get me wrong, I can love me some drama, but this movie seemed to exaggerate some of the drama! Maybe I found it melodramatic due to the fact that there occasional bouts of overacting and some of the characters were a bit 2-dimensional and stereo-typical... one major example of this was the rogue Southern General and his molie crew of henchmen.  A lot of the ""early"" story line was rushed and told in flash backs, so I never made a strong connection with the wife and son. And the voice over commentary was to me, a tad over the top and annoying. The animated segments really didn't add much to the movie, it seemed to remove reality and add a dream-like quality to the movie.  However, the animation used to introduce each new chapter was nicely done.  And, just exactly where was the main character suppose to live in Tennessee that he could ride for days without coming upon several farms or villages? Tennessee in the 1870s was not like living in the remote regions of Central America! Chances are, if you lived that remotely in the woods, then you would have probably encountered less than a dozen zombies. I would think the zombies would have wandered to areas that were largely populated, instead of deep into the rural woods. All in all, it's really nice to see a movie where everyone involved put forth 100% of themselves... and created a movie that is much better that a lot of crap that major Hollywood studios have been churning out!",4,Zombie House on the Prarie,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,2403,"['Here', 'new', 'twist', 'zombie', 'movies', 'so', 'many', 'folks', 'seem', 'be', 'looking', 'Zombies', '19th', 'Century', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'budget', 'movie', 'guess', 'just', 'show', 'as', 'long', 'got', 'talented', 'creative', 'group', 'folks', 'really', 'dedicated', 'spending', 'time', 'energy', 'project', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'gross', 'amount', 'money', 'support', 'really', 'nice', 'actually', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'movie', 'where', 'thought', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'put', 'writing', 'script', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'interesting', 'story', 'movie', 'had', 'actors', 'could', 'actually', 'act', 'was', 'bit', 'acting', 'now', 'again', 'seemed', 'make', 'movie', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'prop', 'make-up', 'department', 'actually', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'pull', 'off', 'somewhat', 'historically', 'accurate', 'looking', 'period', 'piece', 'realistic', 'looking', 'walking', 'dead', 'negative', 'side', 'movie', 'was', 'times', 'little', 'melodrama', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'can', 'love', 'drama', 'movie', 'seemed', 'exaggerate', 'drama', 'Maybe', 'found', 'melodramatic', 'due', 'fact', 'occasional', 'bouts', 'overacting', 'characters', 'were', 'bit', '2-dimensional', 'stereo-typical', 'one', 'major', 'example', 'was', 'rogue', 'Southern', 'General', 'molie', 'crew', 'henchmen', 'lot', 'early', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'rushed', 'told', 'flash', 'backs', 'never', 'made', 'strong', 'connection', 'wife', 'son', 'voice', 'commentary', 'was', 'tad', 'top', 'annoying', 'animated', 'segments', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'movie', 'seemed', 'remove', 'reality', 'add', 'dream-like', 'quality', 'movie', 'However', 'animation', 'used', 'introduce', 'new', 'chapter', 'was', 'nicely', 'done', 'just', 'exactly', 'where', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'suppose', 'live', 'Tennessee', 'could', 'ride', 'days', 'coming', 'several', 'farms', 'villages', 'Tennessee', '1870s', 'was', 'not', 'living', 'remote', 'regions', 'Central', 'America', 'Chances', 'are', 'lived', 'remotely', 'woods', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'encountered', 'less', 'dozen', 'zombies', 'would', 'think', 'zombies', 'would', 'have', 'wandered', 'areas', 'were', 'largely', 'populated', 'instead', 'deep', 'rural', 'woods', 'really', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'where', 'everyone', 'involved', 'put', 'forth', '100', '%', 'created', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'lot', 'crap', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'have', 'been', 'churning', 'out']",N/A

Think about The Book Of Eli. Imagine if instead the movie wasn't about a man on a quest to deliver a book but instead it stopped 20 minutes into his journey after he came across the first gang of bandits, and that became the entire movie. That is what Exit Humanity is. It's a long drawn on movie with an uninteresting plot that doesn't carry much suspense. The acting is good for this type of low budget film, and the animated selections add an interesting touch. However what's out of place is the Narration POV story format that gets old quickly and the idea that there's never a moment when you feel like the characters have a reason to run for their lives or be in fear like most Zombie movies.This probably would have been a better Post Civil War movie than a Zombie movie. It would be better if there were no Zombies and instead it was about a Soldier who came home and found his family murdered by bandits and go on a hunt to find them for revenge, then find out in the end the bandits are a group of soldiers who have been tainted by what they've experienced in war and can't seem to forget the battle field so they kill,rape, and rob people. Then the movie is about the former soldier hunting down these men and making them pay for what they did and in the final scene he has a stand off with the former General who commanded the group of bandits and for a twist let it not be just that he had a simple group of bandits, but they were just a few soldiers from the army he was rebuilding to raise war again only this time to attack the WEST.

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 2]","In a world stuffed to the eyeballs with zombie films, the horror genre continues to explore new ideas with zombies merely a backdrop for good storytelling.  In ""Exit Humanity,"" an atmospheric meditation on being a parent in post-Civil War America, the zombies are just another hazard in a dangerous world.Narrator Brian Cox shares the story of Edward Young (Mark Gibson), a soldier of the South who loses his wife and son to the zombie outbreak.  Distraught, he plays with his life in a game of Russian roulette, only to decide on a new course of action: Young will spread his son's ashes at a scenic waterfall he promised to take him to.With this singular goal in mind, Young sets out across a blasted countryside, facing down zombies and looters before he meets a fellow survivor Isaac (Adam Seybold), who has a nobler cause in mind.  Isaac's sister Emma (Jordan Hayes) has been kidnapped by the mad general Williams (Bill Moseley), who is hell bent on finding a cure to the zombie plague. Williams is convinced he can find someone who is immune to the zombie plague and thereby create a cure.There's a bit of a logic leap in this plot twist: it's never made clear why Williams would think a cure is feasible and why such a cure would be found in a person instead of say, a flower or a medicine man's poultice.  But once the basic nature of the plot is set up we know that any hope of a cure is most assuredly tied up in Isaac's quest to rescue his sister.The movie is told in chapter format, as written down by Young in his journal.  The beginning narrative implies that a zombie plague has returned but never addresses what's happening in the present -- it's besides the point.  Instead, we're treated to beautiful sketches that bridge each scene, skipping ahead to propel the narrative.  Unfortunately this doesn't happen nearly enough, and there are interminable sequences where not much happens.  Youngs spends a lot of time roaring into the wind.There's not a lot of twists in the ending.  The beauty of a well-crafted zombie film is that it's about people first, zombie second, and ""Exit Humanity"" is no different.  But it's a little too plodding, a little too meandering a little too self-absorbed with its heavy themes of forgiveness and rebirth, to be really be entertaining.  ""Exit Humanity"" is a bit of a snooze at times and that's a shame, because it's cinematography is beautiful enough to take time to drink in.

The story follows a veteran (Mark Gibson) who begins searching for his son after coming home to find his wife as being one of the undead, and eventually leads into something much, much worse.  Narrated by Brian Cox and also featuring genre stalwarts Dee Wallace, Bill Moseley, and Stephen McHattie, Exit Humanity is a low-budget affair that isn't short on ingenuity, as it features great performances and some surprisingly stunning animated segments as well.

You find yourself waiting for commercial breaks.It has a made-for-TV feel to it with a quality that hovers between community theater and Sci Fi Channel original movie.  I think it is the costumes that really hold this film back.  It may be Dee Wallace dressed like a high school version of a gypsy or the (I kid you not) pleather jacket worn by the protagonist.  Not even good pleather.  Is there such a thing as bootleg pleather?  You may think so after watching this.Of course he makes up for it with his origami blanket.  A small blanket that he cunningly converts into a scarf/shawl/hood arrangement that would make MacGyver drool.Warning!  Here be spoiler alerts!There are plot holes you could drive a Kardasian through.  Mainly, the movie seems indecisive about what it is about.  A man returns from hunting to discover his wife dead and son missing.  This is a film about a man searching for his son.Oh wait!  He finds the boy and the kid is now a zombie.  So he burns the boys body and gathers his ashes.  He remembers a waterfall he promised to take his son to and sets out with the ashes.

I don't think I even got to the thirty minute mark. Here's what I remember from the movie. First, the events have already happened. Someone opens up a book or a journal or something and is telling us about some past Civil War Zombie outbreak. Scene one seems to have our hero, the father, fighting in the Civil War and also having to down some Zombies. Another flashback has the man returning to his home. I think the man had to kill his wife who had become a zombie but I can't remember. There are LONG drawn out scenes of the man agonizing the loss of his wife and his missing son. The man goes out looking for his son on a horse. The man stops to get water at a creek and is attacked by a zombie who is hiding underwater. Well, the underwater zombie was pretty scary. Anyway, the man then sees what looks like a young blonde girl, but what, that's his long blonde haired son. So he has to kill the boy with a gun shot to the head. Then he burns the body. The problem I have with this movie is the narrator talking over the movie and the low budget of it all. The movie is a modern take on zombies I guess but it didn't do anything for me. This man is completely destroyed and devastated by what has happened. He shouldn't even be able to function. The zombies should have killed his ass long before. But still this man mopes around the zombie filled countryside on a horse focused only on finding his son. The man is lost in his agony. It seems like the story is over before it began. The movie has a very intense human and emotional impact. On the one hand the movie shows very real human pain. On the other hand the movie is very, very stupid. So the combination of real human pain and stupidity and the narrator just made this movie feel like a steaming pile of horse squeeze. Also, the movie is shot in some unreal lighting. It was just hard to watch this movie in the unreal lighting. To me zombie movies are about trying to survive. You can't be having a long, long, long drawn out emotional breakdown when zombies are afoot. And who needs some ""Wonder Years"" type old man narrator talking over the whole movie. The movie just kept jumping around from the past to the present in weird lighting with a narrator and with bad acting. For me watching this movie, which is very LONG, would have been very painful. Personally I think all you had to know was the company behind the movie. The movie is made by some small low budget outfit called ""Bloody Disgusting"".

Full of the depth, feeling, and realism of a drama about the loss and pain left after the bloodiest battle in America's history, I found myself wondering at times, why the producer and director hadn't changed directions and filmed an engaging Civil War drama.  But I'm also glad they did not.  For it lifted the tired old story of a man losing everything after the war, and seeking revenge, and hope, to a whole new level with the zombie background story.  Or maybe I should've said, it lifted the zombie genre to a whole new level with the Civil War as the backdrop.  The film is suitably dark, grim, and emotional, as zombie films should be.  The cast is excellent here, with a mixture of brand new (Mark Gibson) and veteran actors (Stephen McHattie and Dee Wallace) working well together. If I have one minor gripe, it is that I would've loved to see more screen time with Stephen McHattie.Some have complained about the pacing, but I believe the director did this intentionally, giving the film and old world, pre-technological feel as it built character backgrounds and developed a well thought out story-line.

It includes excessive boring narration. Rather than just let the story unfold, the narrator tells you what you are seeing. It grates on you after the first 30 minutes.After a quick 1865 scene where a single Union soldier is a zombie, the movie jumps to 1871 and there is a minor zombie infestation. Edward had to kill his own wife (Sarah Stunt) and son, the later in an emotionally gripping scene as he holds his zombie son (Christian Martyn) in his arms (facing away) as he reluctantly puts a gun to his son's head... all the while his son is trying to eat his face off. Somehow I didn't feel it.Bits and pieces of the story is told through animation, which unfortunately was far better than the main feature. Edward has tasked himself in taking his son's ashes to a waterfalls, something he had promised him when he was alive. There is an unwritten rule that all promises terminate with any zombie infestation, apparently not known in the 19th century. The story involves his journey to get there and the people/zombies he meets up with along the way.Dee Wallace, the closet thing to an actor in this film gives us a career killer performance as she emotionally explains the origins of the living dead. It was tough to sit through. The film utilizes the sad piano/violin sound track for way too much of the production.Zombie fans should avoid this one. I was confused as I couldn't tell if the film was a bad zombie film or a bad drama with zombies.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Zombie make-up was good where it was applied, exposed necks are optional.***POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILER*** The film attempts to come across as a prequel for zombie films. It does a very poor job. It tells you zombies were created using African spells. But at the same time refutes that idea by making it seem zombies are caused by a virus, with one person in the film having natural immunity, and the infection spreading by a saliva/blood contact.

There's the survivor traveling through lonely territory fighting zombies less the cataclysmic devastation replaced with rather pretty scenery, except for the zombies of course, as well as the search for other survivors but the interactions are typically thoughtful, no random shagging (sorry, this isn't a boob-fest) and actually feels more like a fantasy-based quest.It's pretty essential that a story be convincing and Exit does this well, featuring all-around fine performances with special emphasis on the lead played by Mark Gibson.

And I must say I am really glad I did. It is set in the aftermath of the American Civil War; we are taken to Tennessee in 1865 where we are introduced to Edward Young played by upcoming newbie Mark Gibson. He has come home to find his wife has `turned' and his beloved son is missing. He kills and buries his wife and then gets on his trusted steed called `Shiloh', and sets off to find his missing son; always fearing the worst. He has authentic weapons for the period too which is something I always appreciate.The plot is told with the use of some animation, which I didn't get at first but it actually added quite a bit to the whole atmosphere of the film, which is one of its strong points. The story is being narrated by an heir to Edward called Malcolm Young, and this voice is that of Brian Cox, who is always excellent even when it is just the timbre and passion of his voice.On his search he meets more of the undead and then he meets up with some more dangerous folk and these ones aint Zombies. I really liked this film, it has a haunting quality that has nothing to do with the subject matter but the excellent performances put in by the entire cast. The special effects are all excellent too and the Zombies are the good old fashioned kind who amble around moaning in their blood lust, with dead eyes being left as windows to a soul that has long since vacated.This is an original and emotionally charged take on the Zombie genre that is a really refreshing change, to say too much may be a plot spoiler and this is one that you will take something from all of the action. It is not a gore fest but a study of the psychology of grief and coping in extreme circumstances, there is also superstition, love, lunacy and greed, so pretty much something for all the family - except the kids of course.

So, he kills her. But he cannot find his son, Adam (Christian Martyn).So, after trying to find out what makes a zombie tick, he sets out to find his son. Along the way he encounters many more zombies. Some real and some shown in old school comic book style. Sadly, he quickly discovers that Adam has been bitten and so has to put him out of his misery too. And then soon thereafter his horse is next!And so Edward then steels himself in keeping a promise to his son when he was alive - in taking him (his son's ashes now) to the waterfalls. Along the way he runs into Isaac, another lost soul, unbitten and headed his way too. Then come a small bunch of Rebels (who are trying to find their own cure), and a ""witch"" named Eve - who turns out to be nothing of the sort!Come the finale, Rebels kill innocents, innocents kill Rebels, zombies keep eating whoever gets in their way, and closure is brought to the whole mess.

Romero's living dead cycle as of late, there are always some gems that seem to arise within the muck of remakes, pandemic clones and virtual blood baths leading up to nothing.  Writer/Director John Geddes's 'EXIT HUMANITY'-2011 is just that rare gem.  By placing the story during the decline of the Civil War,  we see how the survivors try to cope with an outbreak of living dead through a diary which has survived over the years seeming to be found by modern day humans facing their own living dead onslaught.  The audience is treated as a reader of the document as pages are turned and chapters are introduced while our main character Edward Young continues to write installments till the films conclusion. What Mr. Geddes tries to show in this affair is that their were scrolls of rituals that have survived since the dawn of man that contain spells that can reanimate the dead and that a woman who dabbled in witchcraft had them in her possession. One of the films characters introduced in the middle of the film came across these scrolls and decided to resurrect her dead sister with disastrous results culminating in the spreading of the virus. Interlocked with this story is a sub plot involving a civil war general who's in serious denial that the war is over and is using his megalomania to control what is left of humanity.  Unfortunately, the films only flaw is it length.  The performances are spot on:  Mark Gibson is our main character who gives a remarkable performance in coping with the loss of family and the ever growing  nightmare quickly surrounding him who's diary narration is done by actor Brian Cox giving it an eerie maturity during the proceedings; a beautiful performance by actress Dee Wallace giving her role of Eve, the woman of the forest, incredible fragility and strength; and almost cameos by actors Bill Moseley and Stephen McHattie.  The gorgeous cinematography by Brendon Uegama filmed in Ontario, Canada elevates the film from being just another low budget zombie entry and our living dead cast are adorned with excellent makeup and just the right shambling to give this film the kick it deserves. The film is released to DVD by a company called Bloody Disgusting films in a beautiful 2.35 transfer with excellent sound to enhance the eerieness. Director Geddes leaves us with an unsettling feeling that every hundred years an outbreak of living dead could occur giving our modern day news stories of government training in coping with possible zombie occurrences hackle raising food for thought.

It's a totally different kind of breed. There is no human flesh munching or ripping humans apart. This film is the story (drama) of a man who desperately tries to find his way in a world gone mad. He is looking for a reason to keep on living in a world that is a living hell. So we follow this man Edward Young (intensely and superbly played by Mark Gibson) on his quest for going on with his life. We feel and suffer with him every step of his way. Castwise it's always nice to see pros like Dee Wallace, Bill Moseley and Stephen McHattie at work.This film is an exercise in originality storywise and stylewise (especially for a film with a small budget). So thanks guys for giving us something original that rises way above all the mediocre stuff that comes out of Hollywood these days with their uninspired sequels and reimaginings. You feel with every scene that you watch that this film was a labor of love and that everyone was giving his/her best to make this film the masterpiece it is.",5,A true masterpiece,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,1100,"['Let', 'tell', 'right', 'start', 'are', 'fan', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'movies', 'keep', 'away', 'one', 'totally', 'different', 'kind', 'breed', 'human', 'flesh', 'munching', 'ripping', 'humans', 'apart', 'film', 'story', 'drama', 'man', 'who', 'desperately', 'find', 'way', 'world', 'gone', 'mad', 'looking', 'reason', 'keep', 'living', 'world', 'living', 'hell', 'follow', 'man', 'Edward', 'Young', 'intensely', 'superbly', 'played', 'Mark', 'Gibson', 'quest', 'going', 'life', 'feel', 'suffer', 'step', 'way', 'Castwise', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'pros', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'Bill', 'Moseley', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'work.This', 'film', 'exercise', 'originality', 'storywise', 'stylewise', 'especially', 'film', 'small', 'budget', 'thanks', 'guys', 'giving', 'something', 'original', 'way', 'mediocre', 'stuff', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'uninspired', 'sequels', 'reimaginings', 'feel', 'scene', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'everyone', 'was', 'giving', 'his/her', 'best', 'make', 'film', 'masterpiece']",N/A
1531149,A2GUPJMD2G0XMV,B007I1Q4W2,Worldwalker1967,"[0, 0]","A zombie flick that tackles the ""human"" condition - very good writing, and the acting is realistic for the period. Times are dark given the end of the Civil War, and this is still a low budget production - so I am talking about renting it, not a purchase - but overall this movie worked if you allow yourself to identify with the characters. The zombies and gore are present, but not in your face, and that's because they take a back seat to the plight of the living. Sometimes the ""living"" are far more evil than the dead, and sometimes the very act of ""continuing"" with pain and loss makes us heroic. If you are looking for a mindless, big budget zombiefest - go elsewhere - and that's also why I can understand some people giving it a low rating. However, it's undeserved, or more a product of their expectations/interest level than the movie's intrinsic value.
