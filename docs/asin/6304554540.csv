428519,A9KAY47NCPQS,6304554540,"Beatrice Izzey ""Nanny Dog""","[0, 0]","Disabuses us of any fantasy we have about farm life.A clear eyed, unsappy presentation on how farm life is cruel, harsh, and financially precarious.  Even the most modest level farmers borrow lots of money for necessary operating expenses.  Every year, some of the farmers have bad luck (bad weather, catastrophes, health problems) and become unable to pay back the bank and lose the family farm.  Just like the city folk.Farmers, I learned, just like city folk, are dependent on credit, and live life mortgaged to the hilt.  They die owing shitloads.Feudalism is alive and well, right here in the new world.  We are tied to the land, either metaphorically or literally, and are literally weighed down by our debts.Freedom is an illusion - everyone owes money to the bank and the Man.  ""The only choice we have is choosing which bill to pay first.""  Ouch.Another poignant scene is when the elderly parents are watching Hollywood black and white western movies, and you see how far the real midwestern farm life is so, so far from the kind portrayed in the media.  In real life, there is no dignity, no heroes, no hand of god, no cool dialogue, only drudgery and painkillers.",5,illustrates that small farm life is not all that,1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,1174,"['fantasy', 'have', 'farm', 'life.A', 'clear', 'eyed', 'unsappy', 'presentation', 'how', 'farm', 'life', 'cruel', 'harsh', 'financially', 'precarious', 'Even', 'most', 'modest', 'level', 'farmers', 'borrow', 'lots', 'money', 'necessary', 'operating', 'expenses', 'year', 'farmers', 'have', 'bad', 'luck', 'bad', 'weather', 'catastrophes', 'health', 'problems', 'unable', 'pay', 'back', 'bank', 'lose', 'family', 'farm', 'Just', 'city', 'folk.Farmers', 'learned', 'just', 'city', 'folk', 'are', 'dependent', 'credit', 'live', 'life', 'mortgaged', 'hilt', 'die', 'owing', 'shitloads.Feudalism', 'alive', 'well', 'right', 'here', 'new', 'world', 'are', 'tied', 'land', 'metaphorically', 'literally', 'are', 'literally', 'weighed', 'down', 'debts.Freedom', 'illusion', 'everyone', 'money', 'bank', 'Man', 'only', 'choice', 'have', 'choosing', 'bill', 'pay', 'first', 'poignant', 'scene', 'when', 'elderly', 'parents', 'are', 'watching', 'Hollywood', 'black', 'white', 'western', 'movies', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'real', 'midwestern', 'farm', 'life', 'so', 'so', 'far', 'kind', 'portrayed', 'media', 'real', 'life', 'dignity', 'heroes', 'hand', 'god', 'cool', 'dialogue', 'only', 'drudgery', 'painkillers']",Troublesome Creek VHS
428520,A2LO5XLG3G50PL,6304554540,Eric Swanger,"[4, 4]","I saw this film on the Sundance Channel last year, and have been trying to find it ever since.  Its a deeply personal documentary made by a daughter about her family's struggle to maintain dignity and happiness in a time of financial doom.  Jeanne Jordan returns to rural Iowa where she was raised, in effort to shed some light on the true strength of her family.  Her parents, in an effort to settle their debts to a large midwestern farming bank, are forced to sell off most of their personal belongings, so they may keep the farmland within the family. What is so great about the film is that it was made by someone who is not a mere outsider to the subjects, but a sypathetic and supportive participant in the ordeal itself.  Jeanne Jordan provides a lot of historical background about her family, and also shows that although they are in the midst of bad times, they can still maintain a level of positivity and humor. It plays out like a movie really.  And although there are a lot of really touching moments, it steers clear of becoming too sentimental.  She narrates the film very well, filling in the details when needed, and pulling back when they are easily visible.  And she says some really powerful things about growing up on a farm, which is a lifestyle that many of us cant even begin to understand.  Jordan sums it up beautifully when, near the end, she states &quot;Growing up on a farm is probably like growing up on the coasts, you can never go to far without feeling bereft in some way.&quot;  Very moving film.  One of the best documentaries Ive seen.",5,What A Triumph!!,996105600,"07 26, 2001",2001,1573,"['saw', 'film', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'last', 'year', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'find', 'ever', 'deeply', 'personal', 'documentary', 'made', 'daughter', 'family', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'dignity', 'happiness', 'time', 'financial', 'doom', 'Jeanne', 'Jordan', 'rural', 'Iowa', 'where', 'was', 'raised', 'effort', 'shed', 'light', 'true', 'strength', 'family', 'parents', 'effort', 'settle', 'debts', 'large', 'midwestern', 'farming', 'bank', 'are', 'forced', 'sell', 'off', 'most', 'personal', 'belongings', 'may', 'keep', 'farmland', 'family', 'What', 'so', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'mere', 'outsider', 'subjects', 'sypathetic', 'supportive', 'participant', 'ordeal', 'Jeanne', 'Jordan', 'lot', 'historical', 'background', 'family', 'also', 'are', 'midst', 'bad', 'times', 'can', 'still', 'maintain', 'level', 'positivity', 'humor', 'out', 'movie', 'really', 'are', 'lot', 'really', 'touching', 'moments', 'clear', 'becoming', 'too', 'sentimental', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'filling', 'details', 'when', 'needed', 'pulling', 'back', 'when', 'are', 'easily', 'visible', 'really', 'powerful', 'things', 'growing', 'up', 'farm', 'lifestyle', 'many', 'cant', 'even', 'begin', 'understand', 'Jordan', 'sums', 'up', 'beautifully', 'when', 'end', 'quot', 'Growing', 'up', 'farm', 'probably', 'growing', 'up', 'coasts', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'far', 'feeling', 'bereft', 'way.', 'quot', 'Very', 'moving', 'film', 'One', 'best', 'documentaries', 'Ive', 'seen']",Troublesome Creek VHS

This video fits in perfectly because it highlights the classic struggle that today's farmers have, and it helps students compare today's dream with that of the past.

Gordon,"[0, 0]","Touching, gentle documentary, made by a woman about her parents andfamily, as they face the likely loss of the family farm to the awfuleconomics of modern agricultural life.Done with a light touch and sense of humor which keeps the film fromever becoming maudlin, and reveals that sometimes life's twists andturns, even the bad ones, lead us to places that are OK after all.If there's any weakness to the film, it's that sometimes in avoidingthe sentimental it misses a bit of the emotion, and the fascinatinginsight it provides into the economic realities of family farming (asopposed to the romantic idea so many outsiders have) gets slightlyshort shrift. It would be great to understand even more than thetantalizing bits here why so many family farmers can't make it.",4,"Intimate, personal documentary about the fight to keep a family farm",1305158400,"05 12, 2011",2011,771,"['Touching', 'gentle', 'documentary', 'made', 'woman', 'parents', 'andfamily', 'face', 'likely', 'loss', 'family', 'farm', 'awfuleconomics', 'modern', 'agricultural', 'life.Done', 'light', 'touch', 'sense', 'humor', 'film', 'fromever', 'becoming', 'maudlin', 'reveals', 'life', 'twists', 'andturns', 'even', 'bad', 'ones', 'lead', 'places', 'are', 'OK', 'weakness', 'film', 'sometimes', 'avoidingthe', 'sentimental', 'bit', 'emotion', 'fascinatinginsight', 'economic', 'realities', 'family', 'farming', 'asopposed', 'romantic', 'idea', 'so', 'many', 'outsiders', 'have', 'slightlyshort', 'shrift', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'understand', 'even', 'more', 'thetantalizing', 'bits', 'here', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'family', 'farmers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make']",Troublesome Creek VHS
428523,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6304554540,Linda Linguvic,"[6, 12]","The thing I liked the best about this video was the way it made me understand a way of life in Northern Iowa, put the film in the context of what is happening in our country, and brought the reality facing these very  real people right into my citified consciousness.The film is only 88  minutes long but it seems much too long for the subject, and I found myself  trying too hard to pay attention as the family's problems and stoic  acceptance just go on and on.  I know it was sad and I did have empathy for  them, but I yearned for a bit relief from the dreariness.The basic issue  that Ms. Jordan is dealing with is not just farming, but the moment of  realization when she realizes that everything she thought would be there  forever is disappearing.  This is inevitable, of course.  We all age.  People move.  Old people die.  And life goes on.And, even though it is a  shame that her parents were forced to sell the farm, six months later her  brother had fixed up the house, the father was going back on a regular  basis to drive the farm machinery and help with the work, and both parents  had adjusted to life in town.  All six grown children were healthy and well  with families of their own, and we see them all celebrating the parents'  50th anniversary with all the grandchildren in attendance.In spite of  the sadness I couldn't help thinking about how lucky these people were.  No  bombs or guns had chased them from their home.  Nobody was murdered.  The  family was well and healthy and the parents, in their seventies, were  blessed with a caring and loving family.  So loving, in fact, that their  daughter made this documentary about them.",3,The plight of the disappearing farm family,952992000,"03 14, 2000",2000,1660,"['thing', 'liked', 'best', 'video', 'was', 'way', 'made', 'understand', 'way', 'life', 'Northern', 'Iowa', 'put', 'film', 'context', 'what', 'happening', 'country', 'brought', 'reality', 'facing', 'very', 'real', 'people', 'right', 'citified', 'consciousness.The', 'film', 'only', '88', 'minutes', 'long', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'subject', 'found', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'pay', 'attention', 'family', 'problems', 'stoic', 'acceptance', 'just', 'go', 'know', 'was', 'sad', 'did', 'have', 'empathy', 'yearned', 'bit', 'relief', 'dreariness.The', 'basic', 'issue', 'Ms.', 'Jordan', 'dealing', 'not', 'just', 'farming', 'moment', 'realization', 'when', 'everything', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'there', 'forever', 'disappearing', 'inevitable', 'course', 'age', 'People', 'move', 'Old', 'people', 'die', 'life', 'on.And', 'even', 'shame', 'parents', 'were', 'forced', 'sell', 'farm', 'six', 'months', 'later', 'brother', 'had', 'fixed', 'up', 'house', 'father', 'was', 'going', 'back', 'regular', 'basis', 'drive', 'farm', 'machinery', 'help', 'work', 'parents', 'had', 'adjusted', 'life', 'town', 'six', 'grown', 'children', 'were', 'healthy', 'well', 'families', 'own', 'see', 'celebrating', 'parents', '50th', 'anniversary', 'grandchildren', 'attendance.In', 'spite', 'sadness', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'how', 'lucky', 'people', 'were', 'bombs', 'guns', 'had', 'chased', 'home', 'Nobody', 'was', 'murdered', 'family', 'was', 'well', 'healthy', 'parents', 'seventies', 'were', 'blessed', 'caring', 'loving', 'family', 'So', 'loving', 'fact', 'daughter', 'made', 'documentary']",Troublesome Creek VHS
