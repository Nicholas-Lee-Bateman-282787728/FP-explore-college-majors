350090,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,630300203X,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 6]","""The Good Son"" was the edgy '90s ""thriller"" in which Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin channeled his demon seed equivalent. It has an oddly good pedigree, with Ian McEwan (who atoned for this with ""Atonement"",another story about a malicious child) as its screenwriter and Elmer Bernstein,a mainstay of '50s/'60s classics, composing the score. It's a B movie that has a soundtrack and a screenplay too good for it.""Good Son"" has grieving little Mark (Elijah Wood) sent from the beautiful land of New Mexico to the Maine wilderness to live with his mischievous cousin Henry (Macaulay Culkin),Henry's sister Connie (Quinn Culkin) and his uncle Wallace (the actor is currently starring as the homophobic,homicidal Col. Mayer on ""As the World Turns"",soap fans!) Mark learns that Henry is a creepy fellow with a morbid fascination with death. Culkin is quite amazing as the charismatic,manipulative Henry. He&his; real-life sister have a realistic dynamic. There are many suspenseful moments, and the soundtrack is excellent!On the other hand,""Good Son"" has some weak spots. Most significantly,its lead. When Wood tells his shrink about evil's existence, he says it so blandly he's outdoing then-90s blandfest Keanu Reeves. His stock response to Culkin's evil acts is a blank look. He's got the requisite B-movie Prince Valiant 'do. He spends the movie being wide-eyed,hiding,and running (there,I have ""Fellowship"" summed up if you don't have three hours) Usually child stars aren't catatonic; on the whole,they're hammy or sappy. It's quite astounding that once Wood came of age and starred in a certain 9 hour epic involving orcs&evil; bling,he'd inspire tons of racy fanfiction,because he's homely in ""Good Son."" It's a ""thank God for puberty and Peter Jackson!"" film.""Good Son"" is riveting in its badness. The ""Mr. Highway"" scene-in which Henry causes a massive accident-is so ludicrous it's laughable. Henry's snarkiness keeps the movie going. This film deserves a MST3K treatment,as another reviewer noted. ""The Good Son"" gets three stars for Culkin's standout performance,the few moments of suspense,it's a movie so bad,it's good.",3,No Country for Little Boys,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,2129,"['Good', 'Son', 'was', 'edgy', 'thriller', 'Home', 'Alone', 'star', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'channeled', 'demon', 'seed', 'equivalent', 'oddly', 'good', 'pedigree', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'who', 'atoned', 'Atonement', 'story', 'malicious', 'child', 'screenwriter', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'mainstay', ""'50s/'60s"", 'classics', 'composing', 'score', 'B', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'screenplay', 'too', 'good', 'Good', 'Son', 'grieving', 'little', 'Mark', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'sent', 'beautiful', 'land', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Maine', 'wilderness', 'live', 'mischievous', 'cousin', 'Henry', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'Henry', 'sister', 'Connie', 'Quinn', 'Culkin', 'uncle', 'Wallace', 'actor', 'currently', 'starring', 'homophobic', 'homicidal', 'Col.', 'Mayer', 'World', 'Turns', 'soap', 'fans', 'Mark', 'Henry', 'creepy', 'fellow', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'death', 'Culkin', 'quite', 'amazing', 'charismatic', 'manipulative', 'Henry', 'real-life', 'sister', 'have', 'realistic', 'dynamic', 'are', 'many', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'other', 'hand', 'Good', 'Son', 'weak', 'spots', 'Most', 'significantly', 'lead', 'When', 'Wood', 'shrink', 'evil', 'existence', 'so', 'blandly', 'outdoing', 'then-90s', 'blandfest', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'stock', 'response', 'Culkin', 'evil', 'acts', 'blank', 'look', 'got', 'requisite', 'B-movie', 'Prince', 'Valiant', 'movie', 'being', 'wide-eyed', 'hiding', 'running', 'have', 'Fellowship', 'summed', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'three', 'hours', 'Usually', 'child', 'stars', 'are', ""n't"", 'catatonic', 'whole', ""'re"", 'hammy', 'sappy', 'quite', 'astounding', 'once', 'Wood', 'came', 'age', 'starred', 'certain', '9', 'hour', 'epic', 'involving', 'orcs', 'evil', 'bling', ""'d"", 'inspire', 'tons', 'racy', 'fanfiction', 'homely', 'Good', 'Son', 'thank', 'God', 'puberty', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'film', 'Good', 'Son', 'riveting', 'badness', 'Mr.', 'Highway', 'scene-in', 'Henry', 'massive', 'accident-is', 'so', 'ludicrous', 'laughable', 'Henry', 'snarkiness', 'movie', 'going', 'film', 'MST3K', 'treatment', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'Good', 'Son', 'three', 'stars', 'Culkin', 'standout', 'performance', 'few', 'moments', 'suspense', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'good']",Good Son VHS

Christopher ""Kit"" Culkin is Macaulay Culkin's father, and he pushed for Mac to play Henry, a child that looked fine on the outside but to call him disturbed and violent would be an understatement. By the way, when I said he pushed for the role, I meant that Kit is one of those people who gets what he wants by any means necessary. He also pushed for Mac to get top billing, and looking back, I think that was pretty obvious because a lot of people (myself included) think Elijah Wood should have gotten top billing because he had far more lines.Now on to the movie. I think this movie was a little disturbing, but maybe it was because people were used to Macaulay playing a spunky, comedic kid in family films. But then again, maybe the movie would have been disturbing no matter WHO the lead was. Reason being, it was also weird how violent Henry was, and it was apparently for no reason. Also, I think the only reason this movie was rated R was to keep a lot of kids from seeing Mac in such a different role (especially when he utters the ""F"" word). This movie really should have been rated PG-13.All in all, this movie is kind of hard to describe in a few words.

Now, there's cousin Mark (Elijah Wood from The Ice Storm, Lord Of The Rings, and Sin City) to worry about. He's staying for a couple of weeks while his dad (David Morse from The Green Mile and Disturbia) is in Japan. At first, Henry thought that Mark might be fun, but he's a drag.

Apparently he was trying to shake off the stigma of his role as Kevin McCallister and the limits it placed on him, artistically, at the tender age of 12.  You can't exactly carve out your place in acting history alongside such masters as Robert De Niro and Marlon Brando if all you're going to do in your movies is set booby traps and die by bee sting.

Culkin and Wood are two equally gifted young actors, but when it comes to this film, Wood comes off better than Culkin. I must admit, there's something morbidly fascinating and wickedly funny about seeing the HOME ALONE kid walking around smoking, using four-letter words, and generally making life Hell for those around him.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[16, 23]","It's child-star vs. child star in ""The Good Son,"" a disturbing suspense movie about the brutality that even children can commit. Somehow it's not surprising that Ian McEwan wrote the screenplay -- it's no cheery, cutesy story, but a horror movie in every sense of the word.As the movie opens, Mark (Elijah Wood) is brought to his mother's bedside as she dies. At the funeral, his father learns that he will have to go on a business trip, which will ""set you and Mark up for life."" So he drops off Mark at his uncle and aunt's in New England, hoping that the boy will buck up emotionally when he's around other kids. At first, all is well -- Mark immediately becomes pals with his cousin Henry (Macaulay Culkin), and the boys are soon inseparable.But then Henry enlists Mark in a crazy prank: throwing a dummy onto a crowded highway, causing a massive accident. Mark realizes that his cousin cares nothing about the lives of others -- and discovers that he may have caused his baby's brother's mysterious death. But no one believes Mark -- and now Henry is planning to kill others in his family...It's a sad fact that children can be as evil as adults, but the myth of childish purity sticks to us. That's why ""Good Son"" is so disturbing. Rather than treating the two kids as cardboard cutouts, they are as complex as adults -- capable of good or evil, and of terrible thoughts and actions. And, as we see in Mark, they can be heroes as well.The storyline has a few too many cliches -- for example, the parents are utterly in the dark about Henry's true nature, although the mom does get a clue late in the movie. Ian McEwan did an excellent job with the scripting, however, slowly building up the suspense through little things like Henry pondering, ""If I let you fall... do you think you could fly?"" as Mark was dangling off a tree's branch. He also gives a sense of despration, as Mark tries to rescue Henry's little sister from an ""accident,"" or destroys all the food when he thinks Henry has poisoned it all.Wood gave a stellar performance as Mark, though he was the lesser child star at the time. He uses his expressive face and eyes to full advantage, showing all of Mark's horror, indecision, fear and sorrow without a word. Too bad Culkin wasn't nearly as good -- his portrayal of Henry is completely flat. The most emotion he ever shows is a shrug; I almost expected him to yawn.""The Good Son"" is a disturbing suspense movie, and not one that can be forgotten quickly. The main problem with it is Culkin's acting, while Wood did an outstanding job.",4,"Good son, bad son",1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,2557,"['child-star', 'vs.', 'child', 'star', 'Good', 'Son', 'disturbing', 'suspense', 'movie', 'brutality', 'even', 'children', 'can', 'commit', 'Somehow', 'not', 'surprising', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'cheery', 'cutesy', 'story', 'horror', 'movie', 'sense', 'word.As', 'movie', 'Mark', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'brought', 'mother', 'bedside', 'funeral', 'father', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'business', 'trip', 'will', 'set', 'Mark', 'up', 'life', 'Mark', 'uncle', 'aunt', 'New', 'England', 'hoping', 'boy', 'will', 'buck', 'up', 'emotionally', 'when', 'other', 'kids', 'first', 'well', 'Mark', 'immediately', 'pals', 'cousin', 'Henry', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'boys', 'are', 'soon', 'inseparable.But', 'then', 'Henry', 'Mark', 'crazy', 'prank', 'throwing', 'dummy', 'crowded', 'highway', 'causing', 'massive', 'accident', 'Mark', 'cousin', 'cares', 'nothing', 'lives', 'others', 'discovers', 'may', 'have', 'caused', 'baby', 'brother', 'mysterious', 'death', 'one', 'Mark', 'now', 'Henry', 'planning', 'kill', 'others', 'family', 'sad', 'fact', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'evil', 'adults', 'myth', 'childish', 'purity', 'sticks', 'why', 'Good', 'Son', 'so', 'disturbing', 'Rather', 'treating', 'two', 'kids', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'are', 'as', 'complex', 'adults', 'capable', 'good', 'evil', 'terrible', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'see', 'Mark', 'can', 'be', 'heroes', 'well.The', 'storyline', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'cliches', 'example', 'parents', 'are', 'utterly', 'dark', 'Henry', 'true', 'nature', 'mom', 'get', 'clue', 'late', 'movie', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'scripting', 'however', 'slowly', 'building', 'up', 'suspense', 'little', 'things', 'Henry', 'pondering', 'let', 'fall', 'do', 'think', 'could', 'fly', 'Mark', 'was', 'dangling', 'off', 'tree', 'branch', 'also', 'sense', 'despration', 'Mark', 'rescue', 'Henry', 'little', 'sister', 'accident', 'destroys', 'food', 'when', 'Henry', 'poisoned', 'all.Wood', 'gave', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Mark', 'was', 'lesser', 'child', 'star', 'time', 'expressive', 'face', 'eyes', 'full', 'advantage', 'showing', 'Mark', 'horror', 'indecision', 'fear', 'sorrow', 'word', 'Too', 'bad', 'Culkin', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'portrayal', 'Henry', 'completely', 'flat', 'most', 'emotion', 'ever', 'shrug', 'almost', 'expected', 'yawn', 'Good', 'Son', 'disturbing', 'suspense', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'forgotten', 'quickly', 'main', 'problem', 'Culkin', 'acting', 'Wood', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job']",Good Son VHS

350109,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,630300203X,HAMLET,"[0, 1]","WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!This intense & heart-warming suspense thriller stars Macaulay Culkin (""Uncle Buck,"" ""Home Alone,"" ""My Girl,"" ""Home Alone 2: Lost In New York"") and Elijah Wood (who would later star as Frodo in Peter Jackson's epic ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy) as two cousins, one of whom is reeling from the untimely death of his mother and the other who may or may not be what he seems. Both actors fit their roles perfectly. In several scenes, Macaulay reminded me of Hannibal Lecter in ""Silence Of The Lambs."" I felt that the evil child was a mini-Hannibal (minus the cannibalism, of course). I like one scene in particular: when Mark is moaning in his sleep and he thinks he sees his deceased mother, he follows her down the stairs and calls out to her, but it's his aunt Susan, he cries and she comforts him. That scene was beautifully shot and very tender (personally, I would have added a bit more to the scene). The sweetness is dispelled when the camera slowly pans up to reveal Henry watching this poignant moment from the banisters. Quinn Culkin (Macaulay's kid sister) was simply adorable as-you guessed it-Henry's kid sister. I have a few minor complaints: the movie ended too abruptly (it could have been 10-15 minutes longer, showing what happened on the cliff after the intense climax) and the evil child screamed as he fell (it seemed so out of character for him). Other than that, it's a very well done movie. Language and violence are very minimal for an R-rated movie (one F-word, two H-ll's and one God-d--n); it should have been rated PG-13.",5,Heart-Warming & Intense Thriller.

350113,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,630300203X,JGC,"[3, 6]","""The Good Son"" is more of an answer than a question, I think. Because it tells the viewer that sometimes things aren't always what they appear to be. When I first saw this movie, some 15 years ago when it was first out, I had a hard time believing the plot; especially the ending. How can parents be so blind? Could this really happen? The film is rather thought-provoking in that regard.Here's the characters of this movie (listed in order of importance:)Henry Evans (Macaulay Culkin)Mark Evans (Elijah Wood)Susan Evans (Wendy Crewson)Connie Evans (Quinn Culkin)Wallace Evans (Daniel Hugh Kelly)Jack Evans (David Morse)Dr. Alice Davenport (Jacqueline Brookes)I also enjoyed the movie because it showcased Macaulay Culkin in a new and exciting role. Before this, we all knew him as cute Kevin McCallister in the Christmas-classic, Home Alone. Maybe, one of the reasons why this movie is somewhat controversial is because a lot of people can't get passed that.Once Mark goes to stay with Uncle Wallace and Aunt Susan Henry really starts to unravel. He plans that horrible accident (over the freeway,) he kills the dog and he makes cryptic threats to Mark. And, that was something else that made me think. Why was he all-of-a-sudden starting to unravel? In hindsight, the answer is two-fold. Henry was always a kook. But his parents were too oblivious to that detail. And, things only began to get worse when Mark came around because Henry was acting up out of jealousy.Macaulay Culkin plays a severely disturbed child with such finesse and talent. Because Henry wasn't just a spoiled brat that always wanted to get his way and always wanted attention. He was a calculating misery-machine who didn't let anything stand in his way when he wanted something. And he was vastly intelligent.My favorite part is when Mark confronts Henry in the tree house. This is probably the first (and only) time in Henry's life where he was called to explain his evil actions. And, I loved what Henry said to him, ""don't f-u-c-k with me."" Who would of thought that Macaulay Culkin had it in him!The ending of the movie was incredibly outrageous and over-the-top. But it was pure drama and interesting up and until the last second!The supporting cast was extraordinary. I really enjoyed the performance by soap opera veteran, Jacqueline Brookes as Dr. Alice Davenport. Dr. Davenport added a touch of realism and continuity to the film because she was always around to help the ""troubled"" Mark. I loved it when she said to Mark (in the park, after he missed his appointment with her,) ""I don't believe in evil,"" and the very talented Elijah Wood (as Mark) said to her, ""you should.""I did find one scene towards the end to be rather odd. Remember when Uncle Wallace locked Mark in his office and Mark started banging on the windows to warn Aunt Susan about Henry? Why did he call her ""Susan?"" He never once referred to her as ""Aunt Susan"" as one would expect him to.There isn't a bona fide ""special edition"" DVD. However the DVD does include some special features, such as: a full screen version of the film, a wide screen version of the film, close-captioning, language selection, the original movie trailer and a brief featurette on the making of the film. The movie is a total of 86 minutes long, which goes by very quick.Doesn't it seem like the early to mid-90's were the Golden Age of Suspense/Mystery Thrillers? There were so many great movies in this genre, during this time. Besides ""The Good Son,"" I highly recommend these pictures:Single White Female,The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,Unlawful Entry,The Crush,Passenger 57,The Client,Under Siege,Poison IvyandThe Fugitive.I really love ""The Good Son."" It has everything you would expect in an over-the-top film. Excitement, suspense, drama and maybe even a bit of comedy and camp thrown in for good measure. But this is not a children's movie. Just because the 2 main stars are children does not mean kids should be watching it.

Since  then, I have also seen his movie the stepfather. It is interesting to watch  one and then the other. You notice many subtle similarities. For example:  In The Stepfather, after murdering his original(or so we think)family, the  stepfather whistles the song camptown races as he waltzes out of the house  as if nothing ever happened and disappears. In the hide and go seek scene  in The Good Son, Henry (Mac's character) hums camptown races after the  first terrifying round of the game, almost as if thinking sinister thoughts  inside his mind. I also notice that Joseph Ruben uses New England settings  for both these stories. Out of the two films mentioned, I thought that  Stepfather did a better job with suspense and character development.  However, both movie were well acted and enjoyable.

You could really see the fear in his eyes when he realizes Henry(Macaulay Culkin) is planning to hurt someone.The story begins with a vast highland then starts off with Mark (Elijah) playing soccer with his friends. Then, out of the blue, his dad appears and we are brought to a hospital scene where Mark sits beside his mother's deathbed. He promises her that she won't die.Unfortunately, she does and Mark is full of sadness at her funeral. His dad has to go to a business trip to Japan for 2 weeks leaving him behind with Henry's family. At first, he gets along well with Henry but soon finds out his evil schemes. Henry always gets away with all his schemes with his angelic smile.I thought Elijah was great, as he always is in all his movies. Though he was only a kid back then, he acted from his heart. As for Macaulay, I thought he really showed a sense of madness and jealousy but lost expression at times. He was great at expressing silent anger and suspense. He showed that he was fully in the dark side. Although he had little changes in facial expressions and reactions from that of 'Home Alone', I still have to give him credit for acting such a difficult role. If you've never been on stage or films before, you'd never know how hard it is to act as a villain than a hero.Some scenes really impressed me especially the cliff scene. It's amazing how the production managed to shoot that part without any visual effects especially with two young lads.All in all, I thought the movie was entertaining. I was impressed at how 12-year-olds could do really well at their age. I'm already 15 and have experienced acting on stage and you all must know. It's not easy. Before critizing their acting, you have to think that they're only kids and I have to say, they were very professional. If you like movies with suspense and drama, you'd better watch this.

That's how ""The Good Son"", the remake of a much better film, ""The Bad Seed"" was born.The premise of the story is that Culkin is a menace (more in the sense of Anakin Skywalker, not Dennis) and terrorizes Mark (the Elijah Wood character) who comes to stay with Macaulay's family after his mother dies.  Rather than give us settle clues and build suspense, the film simply shows us one terrible act committed by Culkin's character after the other.  Elijah Wood--who is a fine actor, even as a child--is reduced to a cartoonish situation of witnessing these crimes but not being in a position to stop him (after all, Culkin's character threatens, he's the one that's ""messed up"" since his mother died).This motion picture may be thrilling to good, well-behaved 12-year-old boys who want to get a taste of the wild side (of course, they're too young to see it), but for everyone else it is either going to be a grim reminder of the evening news, or a boring motion picture that fails to live up to the talents of those acting in it.To really see these stars shine as child actors I recommend ""My Girl"" for McCulkin fans (which is by far his best picture) and ""Radio Flyer"" for Elijah Wood fanatics.",2,Yawn!,1070841600,"12 8, 2003",2003,1380,"['deal', 'was', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'would', 'return', 'Home', 'Alone', 'was', 'allowed', 'be', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'un-Kevin', 'name', 'character', 'John', 'Hughes', 'film', 'how', 'Good', 'Son', 'remake', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'was', 'born.The', 'premise', 'story', 'Culkin', 'menace', 'more', 'sense', 'Anakin', 'Skywalker', 'not', 'Dennis', 'terrorizes', 'Mark', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'character', 'who', 'stay', 'Macaulay', 'family', 'mother', 'dies', 'Rather', 'give', 'settle', 'clues', 'build', 'suspense', 'film', 'simply', 'one', 'terrible', 'act', 'committed', 'Culkin', 'character', 'other', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'who', 'fine', 'actor', 'even', 'child', 'reduced', 'cartoonish', 'situation', 'witnessing', 'crimes', 'not', 'being', 'position', 'stop', 'Culkin', 'character', 'one', 'messed', 'up', 'mother', 'died', '.This', 'motion', 'picture', 'may', 'be', 'thrilling', 'good', 'well-behaved', '12-year-old', 'boys', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'taste', 'wild', 'side', 'course', ""'re"", 'too', 'young', 'see', 'everyone', 'else', 'either', 'going', 'be', 'grim', 'reminder', 'evening', 'news', 'boring', 'motion', 'picture', 'live', 'up', 'talents', 'acting', 'it.To', 'really', 'see', 'stars', 'shine', 'child', 'actors', 'recommend', 'Girl', 'McCulkin', 'fans', 'far', 'best', 'picture', 'Radio', 'Flyer', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'fanatics']",Good Son VHS

Macaulay Culkin is great as the cute-but-evil Henry as is Elijah Wood as Mark, the protagonist. I thought they both did a great job as portraying beleivable charactors (especially considering that they were six years too young to legally watch their own movie).The plot of the movie is very consistant and goes not slow down or drag in places and some of the scenes are very suspenceful, particularly the scene where Henry is pointing a nail-gun toward a cat and we dont know if he is going to kill it.I was very surprised that this movie was rated 18 as there is no sex or violence at all and only one swear (the F word) so I would say this movie is probably ok for children over the age of 12 or so to watch.Shortly after Mark's (Elijah Wood) mother dies, his father takes him to live in New England with his Aunt and Uncle and 12 year old cousin, Henry (Macaulay Culkin). At first Mark seems to be having a good time until he begins to see the real Henry when a slip leaves him dangling over the side of a treehouse (which is about 100 feet high) and Hery asks him ""If I let go, do you think you could fly?"".

Especially when the film has with a kid killing off his family members. It's just wrong to do when children are at that young an age. Is it any wonder that Macaulay Culkin has turned out the way he did, whether you believe the press or not, or a certain MJ is involved. This movie gave me the creeps, I dread to think how it messed up his poor little head. To say his character is a homicidal kid with serious problems is an understatement. First of all, he kills a dog with a nail-gun he created. And then he tries to kill his sister (numerous times). And then we find out that years ago, his little brother drowned in the bathtub while he was looking over him (we find out later he killed the boy because his brother got one of his toys, a rubber duck, and he wanted it back). It was cool to see Macaulay in a slightly different role to that of the rich or bratty little kid he's played so often. If you want to see a role where he's really different, Saved comes highly recommended, plus, he looks really cute towards the end! There's no doubt that by the time this film came out and his shocked picture was everywhere on the Home Alone posters, that he was fed up of being typecast.The ending is very creepy, and a bit of a wrong choice to be given to the mother. Frankly, I didn't understand it, and had to ask why, why, why?To say this film is a bit messed up in portraying the oldest child, who was probably jealous of his younger siblings, as a killer, is quite creepy, and very disturbing.

350138,A2CZR46KVZLWDT,630300203X,Suzie,"[25, 30]","Being an actor requires that you be the possessor of a whole list of extraordinary traits such as being at least fairly talented, having an appealing personality, being just original enough to be interesting and looking halfway decent in stylish clothes, among others. Being a child actor is wholly different, mostly because the large majority of child actors defy the number one rule in that they are sadly lacking in any form of true talent.For example, you have Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who were (and still are) unbearable to watch on screen. There is also every child who ever set foot on the set a Disney channel show and most of the children with small roles on adult sitcoms. These kids are cute but they just can't act.So when an agent comes across a really good child actor, its no surprise that suddenly that poor kid is slapped with a starring role in every movie made while they're still young enough to look normal in overalls, hence, the story of McCauley Culkin and Elijah Wood's lives.One of the most interesting things about Joseph Ruben's 1993 film `The Good Son', is that its about criminal insanity and is rated `R' yet the two main characters are barely ten years old. To Ruben the concept must have stood out as wonderfully original, but making the movie was a risky decision because finding two kids talented enough to play the apparently ""evil"", Henry and his earnest cousin, Mark could not have been easy.But, miraculously, the casting agents did it and well-known child actors Culkin and Wood were respectively cast.When Mark's mother dies a premature death, he is sent to live with his aunt, uncle and cousins for two weeks while his father closes a business deal in Tokyo. Mark and his cousin Henry are around the same age and immediately get along after being reintroduced. However, things are not as peaceful as they seem in Henry's house. Less than a year ago, the family's youngest child, Richard, drowned in the bathtub and Mark's aunt Susan is still deeply distraught over the ""accident"", which she considers her fault. At first Mark considers this story sad but unpreventable; however, as he gets to know his cousin better, his true personality puts the account in a whole new light.This movie is truly child acting at its best. Culkin's performance suggests that he understands his malicious but brilliant character better than most adult actors understand far simpler roles. Wood, who has always had the ability to completely become any character he plays, is equally stunning, playing a desperate, victimized little boy with outstanding capability. It's hard to judge which young man is the better actor, or even which part was harder to play, their raw talent should make any actor go green with envy. They also have exceptional screen chemistry, which makes not only their characters, but also their characters' relationship intensely believable, the scenes that they are in together are by far the best.David Morse, Wendy Crewson and Quinn Culkin (MaCauley's sister) are also members of the cast, which is particularly small. However, their performances look amateur next to (the older) Culkin and Wood, and in comparison to her brother's Quinn's performance outlines the difference between a good child actor and a bad one.",5,Child Acting at It's Best,1059091200,"07 25, 2003",2003,3268,"['Being', 'actor', 'be', 'possessor', 'whole', 'list', 'extraordinary', 'traits', 'such', 'being', 'least', 'fairly', 'talented', 'having', 'appealing', 'personality', 'being', 'just', 'original', 'enough', 'be', 'interesting', 'looking', 'halfway', 'decent', 'stylish', 'clothes', 'others', 'Being', 'child', 'actor', 'wholly', 'different', 'mostly', 'large', 'majority', 'child', 'actors', 'defy', 'number', 'one', 'rule', 'are', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'form', 'true', 'talent.For', 'example', 'have', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'Olsen', 'who', 'were', 'still', 'are', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'screen', 'also', 'child', 'who', 'ever', 'set', 'foot', 'set', 'Disney', 'channel', 'show', 'most', 'children', 'small', 'roles', 'adult', 'sitcoms', 'kids', 'are', 'cute', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act.So', 'when', 'agent', 'really', 'good', 'child', 'actor', 'surprise', 'suddenly', 'poor', 'kid', 'slapped', 'starring', 'role', 'movie', 'made', ""'re"", 'still', 'young', 'enough', 'look', 'normal', 'overalls', 'hence', 'story', 'McCauley', 'Culkin', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'lives.One', 'most', 'interesting', 'things', 'Joseph', 'Ruben', '1993', 'film', 'Good', 'Son', 'criminal', 'insanity', 'rated', 'R', 'yet', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'barely', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'Ruben', 'concept', 'must', 'have', 'stood', 'out', 'wonderfully', 'original', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'risky', 'decision', 'finding', 'two', 'kids', 'talented', 'enough', 'play', 'apparently', 'evil', 'Henry', 'earnest', 'cousin', 'Mark', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'easy.But', 'miraculously', 'casting', 'agents', 'did', 'well-known', 'child', 'actors', 'Culkin', 'Wood', 'were', 'respectively', 'cast.When', 'Mark', 'mother', 'premature', 'death', 'sent', 'live', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'cousins', 'two', 'weeks', 'father', 'business', 'deal', 'Tokyo', 'Mark', 'cousin', 'Henry', 'are', 'same', 'age', 'immediately', 'get', 'along', 'being', 'reintroduced', 'However', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'peaceful', 'seem', 'Henry', 'house', 'Less', 'year', 'ago', 'family', 'youngest', 'child', 'Richard', 'drowned', 'bathtub', 'Mark', 'aunt', 'Susan', 'still', 'deeply', 'distraught', 'accident', 'fault', 'first', 'Mark', 'considers', 'story', 'sad', 'unpreventable', 'however', 'know', 'cousin', 'better', 'true', 'personality', 'account', 'whole', 'new', 'light.This', 'movie', 'truly', 'child', 'acting', 'best', 'Culkin', 'performance', 'malicious', 'brilliant', 'character', 'better', 'most', 'adult', 'actors', 'understand', 'far', 'simpler', 'roles', 'Wood', 'who', 'always', 'had', 'ability', 'completely', 'become', 'character', 'equally', 'stunning', 'playing', 'desperate', 'victimized', 'little', 'boy', 'outstanding', 'capability', 'hard', 'judge', 'young', 'man', 'better', 'actor', 'even', 'part', 'was', 'harder', 'play', 'raw', 'talent', 'should', 'make', 'actor', 'go', 'green', 'envy', 'also', 'have', 'exceptional', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'not', 'only', 'characters', 'also', 'characters', 'relationship', 'intensely', 'believable', 'scenes', 'are', 'together', 'are', 'far', 'best.David', 'Morse', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'Quinn', 'Culkin', 'MaCauley', 'sister', 'are', 'also', 'members', 'cast', 'particularly', 'small', 'However', 'performances', 'look', 'amateur', 'next', 'older', 'Culkin', 'Wood', 'comparison', 'brother', 'Quinn', 'performance', 'difference', 'good', 'child', 'actor', 'bad', 'one']",Good Son VHS

If only this movie wasn't supposed to be a horror picture.It all starts when Culkin's good cousin Mark, (the far more talented child actor Elijah Wood ) promises his cancer-stricken mother he'll save her. She doesn't make it. Wood blames himself. An opportunity for rustic therapy presents itself when Wood's father (David Morse), who has to make a business trip to Japan, dispatches his son to Culkin's New England home for two weeks. Maybe atop a craggy coastline, Wood can break through the grief and make friends with sweet-faced Culkin. As the boys scramble off to Culkin's treehouse, Culkin's mother (Wendy Crewson) smiles warmly. ""I think he's going to be fine,"" she tells Wood's father. (Insert ""Jaws"" music here. )Near the top of the lofty treehouse, Wood nearly tumbles to his death. Culkin saves him but keeps Wood dangling. ""If I let you go,"" says MacPsycho, ""do you think you could fly?""There are more ominous signs of things to come than there are billboards on Route 1. ""I took a real good look when my brother Richard drowned in the bathtub,"" says Culkin, when the subject of death comes up. And there's a photograph of Little Richard clutching a rubber duck. Remember that duck, it's part of a canard-motif.The forebodings pile up: Culkin shows Wood his homemade crossbow, which fires lethal metal-bolt projectiles. Down goes the local nasty dog. Culkin introduces Wood to his favorite ""fun"" game, in which he takes a dummy, called ""Mr. Highway,"" to a bridge and drops it into dense traffic.  Look! A ten car pile-up! How Culkin smiles.For the plot to survive, characters must lower their intelligence considerably. Culkin's parents remain as oblivious to their son's psychotic tendencies as they are heedless of Wood's perpetual warnings. Like most Hollywood villains, Culkin has a talent for turning the tables on accuser Wood and making him look like the Bad Seed. Everyone suffers from stupidity, from child psychologist Jacqueline Brookes, who believes Culkin's lies, to the ice-skating crowd that watches from a distance as Culkin attempts to drown his sister (Quinn Culkin) under the ice. (What joy!) The ending, featuring more bodies dangling from great heights, is too laughable to outline. Culkin's murderous ways, it turns out, go back to that quacker in the photo. (Don't ask.)Culkin's father Kit apparently held Fox to ransom to extend his son's range with this role (no Good Son, no Home Alone 2.) In any event, young Mac is decisively upstaged by Wood at almost every turn. One can only imagine what the film could have been had the boy's roles been reversed. But it really doesn't matter. Just sit back... strap in... and enjoy the delirium of a successful child star in career freefall.",5,MAC and CHEESE!,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,3183,"['Home', 'Alone', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'apparently', 'tired', 'slapping', 'front', 'mirror', 'forgetful', 'parents', 'bumbling', 'bandits', 'PG', 'ratings', 'gave', 'fans', 'R-rated', 'psycho', 'kid', 'hell', 'Good', 'Son', 'process', 'took', 'axe', 'image', 'career', 'Here', 'Mac', 'little', 'girls', 'thin', 'ice', 'life-sized', 'dummies', 'busy', 'highways', 'barks', 'back', 'ferocious', 'dogs', 'sit', 'there', 'laughing', 'Culkin', 'best', 'comedy', 'ever', 'only', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'horror', 'picture.It', 'starts', 'when', 'Culkin', 'good', 'cousin', 'Mark', 'far', 'more', 'talented', 'child', 'actor', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'cancer-stricken', 'mother', ""'ll"", 'save', ""n't"", 'make', 'Wood', 'opportunity', 'rustic', 'therapy', 'presents', 'when', 'Wood', 'father', 'David', 'Morse', 'who', 'make', 'business', 'trip', 'Japan', 'son', 'Culkin', 'New', 'England', 'home', 'two', 'weeks', 'Maybe', 'craggy', 'coastline', 'Wood', 'can', 'break', 'grief', 'make', 'friends', 'sweet-faced', 'Culkin', 'boys', 'scramble', 'Culkin', 'treehouse', 'Culkin', 'mother', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'warmly', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'fine', 'Wood', 'father', 'Insert', 'Jaws', 'music', 'here', 'top', 'lofty', 'treehouse', 'Wood', 'nearly', 'death', 'Culkin', 'Wood', 'dangling', 'let', 'go', 'MacPsycho', 'do', 'think', 'could', 'fly', 'are', 'more', 'ominous', 'signs', 'things', 'come', 'are', 'billboards', 'Route', '1', 'took', 'real', 'good', 'look', 'when', 'brother', 'Richard', 'drowned', 'bathtub', 'Culkin', 'when', 'subject', 'death', 'up', 'photograph', 'Little', 'Richard', 'clutching', 'rubber', 'duck', 'Remember', 'duck', 'part', 'canard-motif.The', 'forebodings', 'pile', 'up', 'Culkin', 'Wood', 'homemade', 'crossbow', 'lethal', 'metal-bolt', 'projectiles', 'Down', 'local', 'nasty', 'dog', 'Culkin', 'Wood', 'favorite', 'fun', 'game', 'dummy', 'called', 'Mr.', 'Highway', 'bridge', 'drops', 'dense', 'traffic', 'Look', 'ten', 'car', 'pile-up', 'How', 'Culkin', 'plot', 'survive', 'characters', 'must', 'lower', 'intelligence', 'considerably', 'Culkin', 'parents', 'remain', 'as', 'oblivious', 'son', 'psychotic', 'tendencies', 'are', 'heedless', 'Wood', 'perpetual', 'warnings', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'villains', 'Culkin', 'talent', 'turning', 'tables', 'accuser', 'Wood', 'making', 'look', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'Everyone', 'suffers', 'stupidity', 'child', 'psychologist', 'Jacqueline', 'Brookes', 'who', 'Culkin', 'lies', 'ice-skating', 'crowd', 'distance', 'Culkin', 'drown', 'sister', 'Quinn', 'Culkin', 'ice', 'What', 'joy', 'ending', 'featuring', 'more', 'bodies', 'dangling', 'great', 'heights', 'too', 'laughable', 'outline', 'Culkin', 'murderous', 'ways', 'out', 'go', 'back', 'quacker', 'photo', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Culkin', 'father', 'Kit', 'apparently', 'held', 'Fox', 'ransom', 'extend', 'son', 'range', 'role', 'Good', 'Son', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'event', 'young', 'Mac', 'decisively', 'upstaged', 'Wood', 'almost', 'turn', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'boy', 'roles', 'been', 'reversed', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'strap', 'enjoy', 'delirium', 'successful', 'child', 'star', 'career', 'freefall']",Good Son VHS

I've liked it, hated it and loved it.I saw this in theatres at 13, I'm 26 now, and let me tell ya, the impact of it is still very profound. Macaulay or Mac Culkin should not have beenignored in this film, in fact, he should've gotten an oscar nod, because he played his role very well, he may not have liked this role, and off andon, neither did I, but I got over that. This film showed his expansive potential as an actor, and for that, he should be thankful. Elijah Wood also did a very nice job. Joseph Ruben did a good direction, and the musicwas effectively moody. For obvious reasons, this film is not for his young fans. True, the ending is a shock, but so is the car-crash scene w/the evil smile on his face.
