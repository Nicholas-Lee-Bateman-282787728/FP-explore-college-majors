I mean she was great with what she had to work with but the story just couldn't grip me. I kept waiting for something really powerful to happen only to be lead around the corner into another elongated moment. The film is about a supposedly famous psychic named Silver who has come out of ""retirement"" while some paranormal debunkers (Weaver, Murphy) are bored with the typical charlatans of our day. Deniro is off the mark as Silver and seems to be looking to generate a wow moment but never finds it. A very contrived acting turnout from one of the greats.Cillian Murphy (Weavers ""sidekick"") becomes the attempted carrier of the film as does what he can to keep the viewer hooked. There is actually some great material here that just can't translate properly to full entertainment, at least the way this film handled it.

Veddy Bad. SPOILER ALERT. I'm about to reveal plot points, for those of you who don't believe me and decide to watch anyway.First, lose all fantasies of watching Weaver and DeNiro duke it out on screen -- THEY NEVER MEET. Stupid, right? Weaver exits the film halfway through, probably because she came to her senses and realized that whatever they were paying her was not worth the hit on her reputation. DeNiro apparently doesn't care any more. Maybe he took a bath on NYC real estate and needs the money. Anyway, he plays a blind Uri Geller knockoff who comes out of retirement after 30 years, and Weaver is a paranormal researcher who is, you would think, keen to unmask him, but has some nasty history with him. A decent premise if the script were decent (it isn't) or the director knew what he was doing (he doesn't). And for the first 20 minutes or so you think, hey, maybe this will work. And then it gets really stupid. Apparently in this alternate universe, being a Famous Psychic is a Very Big Deal -- enough to capture the imagination of the public, fund university research programs, fuel talk shows, and occupy large sections of the 24/7 cable universe. And if you're caught being a fake? Then it's federal prison time for you.Even if you can accept that premise, the movie just craps out. It turns out the DeNiro isn't really blind (shocking!). And that he wears a magic watch that somehow gives him all the answers (though that is never explained) and somehow allows him to levitate. And that Scary Blue Eyes is, well....

I found the first third a little boring, the second third much more interesting and the final third unbelievable and disappointing.Sigourney Weaver plays, Margaret Matheson, a professor of Science who exposes psychic frauds. With her experience she is able to meet these psychics and debunk them with one meeting. All except one psychic, Simon Silver played by Robert DeNiro. Her younger colleague, Tim Buckley, played by the magnetic Cilian Murphy is an admirer if her intellect and her authority. Margaret has had one devastating experience with Silver, and she will not meet with him again. Buckley is adamant that they must meet, he must debunk Silver's claims. The rest of the film is spent looking atSilver and trying to discover his weakness.What I could never really ne'er stand was what greatness Silver had. There was not enough of his appearances and the investigation into his claims. Murphy,  as magnificent as his performance is, was not able to convince me of his abilities. The acting was superb, but too understated for this kind of film. DeNiro seemed to be a strange actor for this film, although he did hold his own. Weaver and Murphy gave powerful performances, and they were the ones who interested me the most.This is a film that could have been great, except for the missing ingredient, whatever it was.

Sometimes, that ends up being worthwhile.  And sometimes, the reviews were right and a great cast and engaging concept were not enough to exceed the other shortcomings.RED LIGHTS falls, sadly, into the latter category.  A terrific cast of both ""grand"" names (Sigourney Weaver, Robert DeNiro) and some younger actors who've done great work (Cillian Murphy, Elizabeth Olsen).  An interesting concept...a couple of professors (Weaver & Murphy) who go around debunking paranormal activity come up against the most famous psychic in the world (DeNiro).  Sounds like fun.Well, the idea is good.  The plot does take some interesting turns.  But the dialogue and character development is pretty pitiful, and the editing is quite poor.  The movie leaps around in tone for no reason.  Overall, it wants to be serious (as befits these ""great"" actors), but then there are moments of silly playfulness that practically remind me of the TV show ""Supernatural"" and the light banter between the two brothers.  Characters are not fleshed out...such as when Murphy's 30-something professor invites a young student to lunch (Olsen) and the next thing you know, they appear to be practically living together, even though we barely sense a spark between them.  DeNiro is in relatively little of the film, and there's one completely perplexing scene where he interacts one-on-one with Murphy in which the dialogue makes him sound like a lightweight & laughable version of Brando's character in APOCALYPSE NOW.  He spouts ""lofty"" sounding pseudo-philosophy that makes no sense...in fact, it goes beyond that to uncomfortably laughable.Writer Rodrigo Cortes is not helped in his efforts by the director Rodrigo Cortes.  The script is flawed, and the direction seems to play into those flaws, rather than minimizing them.  It makes me believe that Cortes really feels he is making a grand statement about belief and our need to believe in something beyond the ""ordinary"" world.  (There are some scenes with Weaver and her comatose son that are mildly touching, because Weaver is such a good actress.)  But what he's really got here is an extended Twilight Zone episode that needs a bit more building tension and a sense of dread...and easily 15 minutes less running time.I'm curious to know how this excellent cast was assembled for a movie that is so problematic.  Perhaps the original script was better and during filming, was weakened.  Perhaps they are all cousins of the director and did it as a favor.  I just don't know.  At least none of them have irreparably tarnished their reputations.  Weaver comes out best, and while in many ways Murphy's character is the silliest, he's a very interesting actor.  Olsen is nearly a non-entity, but she doesn't do anything to embarrass herself.  DeNiro gives one of his ""paycheck"" performances that he's done so much of lately (which makes his truly committed work in a film like SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK so much more important).Trust me...even if you're a big fan of this cast...don't spend 113 minutes of your life on it.",2,"Good cast, but very flawed writing & direction",1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,3180,"['Sometimes', 'movie', 'compelling', 'concept', 'cast', 'will', 'make', 'point', 'seeing', 'even', 'reviews', 'are', 'mixed', 'best', 'Sometimes', 'up', 'being', 'worthwhile', 'sometimes', 'reviews', 'were', 'right', 'great', 'cast', 'engaging', 'concept', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'exceed', 'other', 'shortcomings.RED', 'LIGHTS', 'falls', 'sadly', 'latter', 'category', 'terrific', 'cast', 'grand', 'names', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'younger', 'actors', 'who', ""'ve"", 'done', 'great', 'work', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Elizabeth', 'Olsen', 'interesting', 'concept', 'couple', 'professors', 'Weaver', 'Murphy', 'who', 'go', 'debunking', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'come', 'up', 'most', 'famous', 'psychic', 'world', 'DeNiro', 'fun.Well', 'idea', 'good', 'plot', 'take', 'interesting', 'turns', 'dialogue', 'character', 'development', 'pretty', 'pitiful', 'editing', 'quite', 'poor', 'movie', 'tone', 'reason', 'Overall', 'be', 'serious', 'befits', 'great', 'actors', 'then', 'are', 'moments', 'silly', 'playfulness', 'practically', 'remind', 'TV', 'show', 'Supernatural', 'light', 'banter', 'two', 'brothers', 'Characters', 'are', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'such', 'when', 'Murphy', '30-something', 'professor', 'young', 'student', 'lunch', 'Olsen', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'appear', 'be', 'practically', 'living', 'together', 'even', 'barely', 'sense', 'spark', 'DeNiro', 'relatively', 'little', 'film', 'one', 'completely', 'perplexing', 'scene', 'where', 'one-on-one', 'Murphy', 'dialogue', 'sound', 'lightweight', 'laughable', 'version', 'Brando', 'character', 'APOCALYPSE', 'NOW', 'lofty', 'sounding', 'pseudo-philosophy', 'sense', 'fact', 'uncomfortably', 'laughable.Writer', 'Rodrigo', 'Cortes', 'not', 'helped', 'efforts', 'director', 'Rodrigo', 'Cortes', 'script', 'flawed', 'direction', 'play', 'flaws', 'rather', 'minimizing', 'believe', 'Cortes', 'really', 'making', 'grand', 'statement', 'belief', 'need', 'believe', 'something', 'ordinary', 'world', 'are', 'scenes', 'Weaver', 'comatose', 'son', 'are', 'mildly', 'touching', 'Weaver', 'such', 'good', 'actress', 'what', 'really', 'got', 'here', 'extended', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'bit', 'more', 'building', 'tension', 'sense', 'dread', 'easily', '15', 'minutes', 'less', 'running', 'time.I', ""'m"", 'curious', 'know', 'how', 'excellent', 'cast', 'was', 'assembled', 'movie', 'so', 'problematic', 'Perhaps', 'original', 'script', 'was', 'better', 'filming', 'was', 'weakened', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'cousins', 'director', 'did', 'favor', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'least', 'none', 'have', 'irreparably', 'tarnished', 'reputations', 'Weaver', 'out', 'best', 'many', 'ways', 'Murphy', 'character', 'silliest', 'very', 'interesting', 'actor', 'Olsen', 'nearly', 'non-entity', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'embarrass', 'DeNiro', 'one', 'paycheck', 'performances', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'lately', 'truly', 'committed', 'work', 'film', 'SILVER', 'LININGS', 'PLAYBOOK', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'important', '.Trust', 'even', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', '113', 'minutes', 'life']",N/A

Without giving away too much. The first scene looked like it was going to be fun but all of a sudden the investigators just leave without exposing anyone. Too bad a great scene turned dud.

Anyway, I'd wait until the price drops on this dvd if your planning to buy it. What a shame a really good idea. I could have made this movie 100x better.

1574210,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B008PUI1EY,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[0, 0]","Rodrigo Cortes' Red Lights starts off as a smart thriller taking place in the world of paranormal debunkers that ends up betraying it's own intelligent ambitions for unconvincing Shamalanian twists. There will be two kinds of audiences for this movie, one looking for the first part and the other who longs for this type of ludicrous ""surprise"" ending. I am sure neither will be satisfied.Sigourney Weaver is once again well cast a strong female authority figure, as Dr. Margaret Matheson she and Cillian Murphy play a pair of psychic investigators, but instead of ghost hunters international they are specialists in debunking the apparently supernatural. In thirty years time Dr. Matheson has never come across a case she couldn't crack with one exception, a blind psychic named Simon Silver (Robert De Niro). As it would happen Silver has come out of retirement to an adoring and willing public, while Margaret wants nothing to do with him, her young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Tom Buckley (Murphy) can't wait to get an opportunity to try and crack this nut.An intriguing concept given that in this day and age when so many people buy into ""reality"" TV shows and other media perpetrating the belief in ghosts, psychics,  healers, dog whispers and other such things. It may not seem like such a serious problem, but indeed they are cons who at best just swindle innocent people out of money and at worst can lead others into harm. I personally have very little patience for this kinds of despicable swindlers. A magician named James Randi has made a life and career out of exposing these frauds and if you don't know who he is, it might be interesting for you look him up on the internet.The cast is heavy in a good way, with De Niro the star attraction as Simon Silver, a sort of a cross between Uri Geller and John Edward. De Niro is able to show off his natural charisma and great showmanship in one of his better recent roles. The first half hour of the movie moves at a rather sluggish pace, largely because we anticipate De Niro, both the actor and his character. However, it is easy to get caught up in the story and eventually ignore the fact that Simon Silver really is a background character in this story.Spanish writer-director Cortes made an impressive English language debut two years ago with the striking Ryan Reynolds thriller Buried. He demonstrated a keen interest in sophist acted scares and nail biting suspense with that movie. It's claustrophobic nature was nearly too much for me, I needed a long walk in the fresh air afterwards. It did it's job very effectively, then Cortes produced his script for the numbingly awful found footage fiasco Apartment 143, a movie that rest towards the top of the worst of 2012. Now with Red Lights, I still believe that Cortes has talent, but perhaps it's been somewhat over stated.A thriller about pseudo-science with only pseudo-scares. It all ends with a plot twist that seems at once  both obvious and ridicules. If Red Lights had taken it's subject matter a little more seriously and not resorted to parlor tricks of it's own, this could have been a very memorable movie.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",3,red light special,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,3171,"['Rodrigo', 'Cortes', 'Red', 'Lights', 'off', 'smart', 'thriller', 'taking', 'place', 'world', 'paranormal', 'debunkers', 'up', 'betraying', 'own', 'intelligent', 'ambitions', 'unconvincing', 'Shamalanian', 'twists', 'will', 'be', 'two', 'kinds', 'audiences', 'movie', 'one', 'looking', 'first', 'part', 'other', 'who', 'type', 'ludicrous', 'surprise', 'ending', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied.Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'once', 'again', 'well', 'cast', 'strong', 'female', 'authority', 'figure', 'Dr.', 'Margaret', 'Matheson', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'play', 'pair', 'psychic', 'investigators', 'instead', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'international', 'are', 'specialists', 'debunking', 'apparently', 'supernatural', 'thirty', 'years', 'time', 'Dr.', 'Matheson', 'never', 'come', 'case', 'could', ""n't"", 'crack', 'one', 'exception', 'blind', 'psychic', 'named', 'Simon', 'Silver', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'would', 'happen', 'Silver', 'come', 'retirement', 'adoring', 'willing', 'public', 'Margaret', 'nothing', 'do', 'young', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Tom', 'Buckley', 'Murphy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'opportunity', 'try', 'crack', 'nut.An', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'given', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'buy', 'reality', 'TV', 'shows', 'other', 'media', 'perpetrating', 'belief', 'ghosts', 'psychics', 'healers', 'dog', 'whispers', 'other', 'such', 'things', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'serious', 'problem', 'indeed', 'are', 'cons', 'who', 'best', 'just', 'swindle', 'innocent', 'people', 'money', 'worst', 'can', 'lead', 'others', 'harm', 'personally', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'patience', 'kinds', 'despicable', 'swindlers', 'magician', 'named', 'James', 'Randi', 'made', 'life', 'career', 'exposing', 'frauds', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'look', 'up', 'internet.The', 'cast', 'heavy', 'good', 'way', 'De', 'Niro', 'star', 'attraction', 'Simon', 'Silver', 'sort', 'cross', 'Uri', 'Geller', 'John', 'Edward', 'De', 'Niro', 'able', 'show', 'off', 'natural', 'charisma', 'great', 'showmanship', 'one', 'better', 'recent', 'roles', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'rather', 'sluggish', 'pace', 'largely', 'anticipate', 'De', 'Niro', 'actor', 'character', 'However', 'easy', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'eventually', 'ignore', 'fact', 'Simon', 'Silver', 'really', 'background', 'character', 'story.Spanish', 'writer-director', 'Cortes', 'made', 'impressive', 'English', 'language', 'debut', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'striking', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'thriller', 'Buried', 'demonstrated', 'keen', 'interest', 'sophist', 'acted', 'scares', 'nail', 'biting', 'suspense', 'movie', 'claustrophobic', 'nature', 'was', 'nearly', 'too', 'much', 'needed', 'long', 'walk', 'fresh', 'air', 'afterwards', 'did', 'job', 'very', 'effectively', 'then', 'produced', 'script', 'numbingly', 'awful', 'found', 'footage', 'fiasco', 'Apartment', '143', 'movie', 'rest', 'top', 'worst', '2012', 'Now', 'Red', 'Lights', 'still', 'believe', 'Cortes', 'talent', 'perhaps', 'been', 'somewhat', 'stated.A', 'thriller', 'pseudo-science', 'only', 'pseudo-scares', 'plot', 'twist', 'once', 'obvious', 'ridicules', 'Red', 'Lights', 'had', 'taken', 'subject', 'matter', 'little', 'more', 'seriously', 'not', 'resorted', 'parlor', 'tricks', 'own', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'memorable', 'movie.see', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",N/A

1574214,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B008PUI1EY,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[0, 0]","The academic world has been largely dismissive of the paranormal, and in particular the so-called hard sciences has -- you're more likely to find folklorists investigating it than physicists.  That seems odd since phenomena that would have been considered quite miraculous 500 years ago have been easily investigated and understood by science today.  The bias against the paranormal seems born more of emotions than rationality, or perhaps, the practical rather than the impractical.  After all, the paranormal doesn't seem to conform to the tenets of conventional science, which would make it tough for conventional scientists to investigate it, which in turn would make it tough to get grants.  ""Red Lights"" starts out sensibly enough, pitting a skeptical psychologist, Matheson (Sigourney Weaver), against myriad charlatans, the most problematic of which seems to be a Uri Geller-like celebrity ESPer called Silver (Robert DeNiro).  The script stays within the bounds of reality right up until the part where her assistant, Buckley (Cillian Murphy), becomes obsessed with Silver, who he suspects may have had murderous intentions toward Matheson.  At this point, Buckley's histrionics change the tone of the film, and it launches into the sort of absurdity about the academic world that filmmakers never can resist -- Buckley, now the department head, threatening and physically assaulting a colleague (poor Toby Jones) in front of peers and students, for instance.  Yawn.  Scholars, even the crummy ones, work in an intellectual world, where the fireworks come from the interplay of thinking and not from violence, yet movies treat them as sophomoric jugheads.  You'll see the ending coming long before it gets unleashed, especially if you listen even casually to a line Buckley says early in the film.  Had what preceded the ending been better, it could have been satisfying.  But as things stand, ""Red Lights"" is too thin and can't decide if it wants to be a drama or a thriller, like an awkward short story with an otherwise interesting premise in an advanced creative writing class.

Dr. Tom Buckly invites a young student (Elizabeth Olsen) and romance interest into the investigating team.As the film progresses a man named Simon Silver (Robert De Niro) a blind psychic...a Kreskin on steroids, comes out of a 30 year retirement to put on a show. Buckly wants to expose Silver, but Matheson does not. She had confronted Silver before and didn't come out at the winning end. Matheson believes he is a fraud, but at the same time knows he is clever enough to deceive her. She wants no part of it.The story then centers around what turns out to be a weird confrontation between Buckly and Silver with an ending that I thought brought the movie down.Good acting with character build up.

1574221,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B008PUI1EY,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[0, 0]","I am a big fan of Cillian Murphy and so decided to give this a punt. It is about some cutting edge paranormal psychic investigators, they are Sigourney Weaver (Dr. Margaret Matheson) and the afore mentioned Mr Murphy as her trusted side kick Tom Buckley. They work at a University where they are having their funding cut whilst fighting the good fight against fake mediums and psychics. Then the mysterious, enigmatic and blind television super psychic comes back into the limelight after a thirty year absence, this is Simon Silver. He had dropped off the radar after a mysterious death in his audience of one of his most out spoken critics. He is played by Robert De Niro, who as ever is good value for money.Meanwhile things start to go wrong around Cillian, lights explode, computers go wrong and things just get smashed, so obviously it is Mr Silver warning him off from investigating his new show. Then things get nasty very quickly and an ultimate show down is all but inevitable. The `red lights' are a reference to things that are so out of place they act as warning signals, like helpers of the psychic going through the audience before hand to glean information that can be fed to the main man. This can be quite atmospheric and has real quality in the mood department and was entreating for the most part, however it does not keep up the good work.So where does it go wrong, well there are loads of hints at things, like why does a blind man wear a watch etc. We are shown some of their pasts but essentially the characters are all pretty much formed and the love interest is more or less shoe horned in, but still kind of works. It is the ending where you realise that this is a just a film of plot holes and that is a bit insulting to the audience; I actually thought this was psycho, babble schmaltz at one point. Either way I was left feeling unfulfilled and for the simple reason that it was so badly written. The acting is all fine as you would expect, but seriously `Scooby Doo' would not get away with such a false ending. Whilst I am still a fan of the actors, I hope they never commit to anything from this production company again. To throw away a `good' film for the formulaic need for a plot twist is plain wrong, only see if you are a fan of the actors.",3,Psycho Babble Plot that is let down by ludicrous ending.,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,2279,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'so', 'decided', 'give', 'punt', 'cutting', 'edge', 'paranormal', 'psychic', 'investigators', 'are', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Dr.', 'Margaret', 'Matheson', 'afore', 'mentioned', 'Mr', 'Murphy', 'trusted', 'side', 'kick', 'Tom', 'Buckley', 'work', 'University', 'where', 'are', 'having', 'funding', 'cut', 'whilst', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', 'fake', 'mediums', 'psychics', 'Then', 'mysterious', 'enigmatic', 'blind', 'television', 'super', 'psychic', 'back', 'limelight', 'thirty', 'year', 'absence', 'Simon', 'Silver', 'had', 'dropped', 'off', 'radar', 'mysterious', 'death', 'audience', 'one', 'most', 'out', 'spoken', 'critics', 'played', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'who', 'ever', 'good', 'value', 'money.Meanwhile', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', 'around', 'Cillian', 'lights', 'explode', 'computers', 'go', 'wrong', 'things', 'just', 'get', 'smashed', 'so', 'obviously', 'Mr', 'Silver', 'warning', 'off', 'investigating', 'new', 'show', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'nasty', 'very', 'quickly', 'ultimate', 'show', 'down', 'inevitable', 'red', 'lights', 'are', 'reference', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'place', 'act', 'warning', 'signals', 'helpers', 'psychic', 'going', 'audience', 'hand', 'glean', 'information', 'can', 'be', 'fed', 'main', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'atmospheric', 'real', 'quality', 'mood', 'department', 'was', 'entreating', 'most', 'part', 'however', 'not', 'keep', 'good', 'work.So', 'where', 'go', 'wrong', 'well', 'are', 'loads', 'hints', 'things', 'why', 'blind', 'man', 'wear', 'watch', 'etc', 'are', 'shown', 'pasts', 'essentially', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'formed', 'love', 'interest', 'more', 'less', 'shoe', 'horned', 'still', 'kind', 'works', 'ending', 'where', 'realise', 'just', 'film', 'plot', 'holes', 'bit', 'insulting', 'audience', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'psycho', 'babble', 'schmaltz', 'one', 'point', 'way', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'unfulfilled', 'simple', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'badly', 'written', 'acting', 'fine', 'would', 'expect', 'seriously', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'away', 'such', 'false', 'ending', 'Whilst', 'am', 'still', 'fan', 'actors', 'hope', 'never', 'commit', 'anything', 'production', 'company', 'again', 'throw', 'away', 'good', 'film', 'formulaic', 'need', 'plot', 'twist', 'plain', 'wrong', 'only', 'see', 'are', 'fan', 'actors']",N/A

Basically you have a two-person team setting out to debunk those who prey on the unwary, hoping to shed some light into the dark hallways of mysticism and psychics.

It spends a lot of time on the subject, noting just how much of the ""art"" is simply that - an art. This might make it boring for some folks. I personally found the sleight of hand interesting but not too terribly high tech. Most of the stuff is something you know already so you won't be wowed by the idea. Its when the weird comes in that will make you question what is going on - and that is the purpose of the film.I also liked the acting style, and thought the list of names associated with this film was surprising.

Robert DeNiro plays Simon Silver, a celebrity mentalist coming back to the stage after a 30-years' hiatus. Cillian Murphy is Dr. Tom Buckley, an assistant to a paranormal debunker Dr. Margaret Matheson played by Sigourney Weaver.In spite of Dr. Matheson&#8217;s warning to stay away from him, Tom Buckley begins to investigate Simon Silver, and strange incidents start happening around the young doctor who gets obsessed with Silver. Does he really have paranormal abilities?Part of the film is probably inspired by real-life scientific skeptic James Randi and his investigations of faith healers. It is obvious that Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s has made extensive researches in his attempt to make the thriller intelligent and cerebral.With all respect to his effort, however, like many smart people he tends to forget one thing. Throughout the movie, Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s does not give us a convincing reason why these academics and students (including Elizabeth Olsen&#8217;s Sally wasted in an unnecessary romantic subplot) have to care whether or not Simon Silver is a fake.Well, actually the director does give one at the climax where something extraordinary is revealed, but too late.

Although I buy a lot of movies from Amazon, lately Best Buy and Walmart are offering some extra (exclusives) that Amazon doesn't have. For example this package (blu ray, DVD, digital copy) was $12.99 from Best Buy only. So make sure you do your homework each time a movie comes out.The movie is just fantastic! Is the kind of movie that you must watch at least twice. Sigourney Weaver is outstanding playing a professor (Margaret Matheson) who tries to debunk all supernatural claims, against a ruthless De Niro who is Simon Silver a powerful blind psychic. Together with her assistant Tom (Cillian Murphy) they try to prove that De Niro is a charlatan. Murphy's contribution in the first half of the movie is small. However, he takes over the entire movie in the second part with an outstanding performance. Elizabeth Olson's role in the movie is minimal.Throughout the entire movie I had the impression that I was missing something. Something was not connecting.  Just until the end when everything makes sense. Then I watched it again and I realized that I didn't paid attention to too many details the first time.  Then, there is De Niro's acting. I have never seen De Niro acting poorly. I have seen De Niro in bad movies (i.e. Machete), but I have never seen De Niro acting poorly. In this movie, where he plays the role of a blind totally ruthless psychic, the first thing that comes to mind is a comparison with the outstanding performance of Al Pacino playing a blind eccentric U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel (Frank Slade) in ""Scent of Woman"". Pacino was rewarded with the Oscar for his great performance and is totally justified. If we compare De Niro's performance in this movie with Al Pacino's performance in ""Scent of a Woman"", we come to the conclusion at first, that De Niro is a poor actor when playing a blind person. However, you need to watch the movie all the way to the end to understand how masterful, profound, and calculated De Niro's performance is in this movie. After I watched the movie I looked at the cover of the blu ray carefully and realized that the cover gives up half of the plot.I am not going to describe more of the movie because I don't want to spoil it for you. You need to watch it and pay attention to the details all the way to the end and the really unexpected and surprising ending. Five stars because of the plot, the direction, and the outstanding performances of all actors. Great movie all around!",5,Absolutely great movie!
