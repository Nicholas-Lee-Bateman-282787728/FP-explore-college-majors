We've seen it several times now at Tyler's urging.  He sings the songs that have some pretty neat tidbits about the planets in them.  He was singing ""93 Million Miles Away""...a song the Sun sings.  He then stopped and realized that he knew the distance the Sun is from the Earth.  What a seamless way to teach kids without them realizing it.  I give this DVD high marks for being original.  I think Chris Kattan from Saturday Night Live is in this as Mars.  I can see this DVD becoming an instant classic. HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.",5,AN INSTANT CLASSIC!,1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,641,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'preview', 'copy', 'My', 'Fantastic', 'Field', 'Trip', 'Planets', 'son', 'Tyler', 'age', '6', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'now', 'Tyler', 'urging', 'songs', 'have', 'pretty', 'neat', 'tidbits', 'planets', 'was', 'singing', '93', 'Million', 'Miles', 'Away', 'song', 'Sun', 'sings', 'then', 'stopped', 'realized', 'knew', 'distance', 'Sun', 'Earth', 'What', 'seamless', 'way', 'teach', 'kids', 'realizing', 'give', 'DVD', 'high', 'marks', 'being', 'original', 'think', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Mars', 'can', 'see', 'DVD', 'becoming', 'instant', 'classic', 'HIGHEST', 'RECOMMENDATION']",My Fantastic Field Trip to the Planets

My granddaughter is in kindergarten (just turned 6), and my 7 year old grandson is blind. They have been learning a lot about the planets, Sun, gravity, space etc.  Anyway, they love this DVD.  I had to buy it used because I couldn't find a new one. It was perfect.  This is a kid's animation adventure.  A boy in a spaceship meets each of the planets in the solar system. Each planet sings about itself -- it is phenomenal how easy the songs make it to remember information about the planets. My grandkids watched this a few times and knew  most of the words to the songs. THEY LOVED IT.  Seriously, my granddaughter said this DVD is now her favorite DVD -- she wants to take it to school as well. Up until now, The Wizard of Oz has been her favorite all her life.  Also, my blind grandson loved this. After spending a few weeks learning about the solar system in a variety of formats, this was the least dry -- it's hilarious and lively and a blast!  My grandson loves the songs.  Then, on the DVD there is a 5-question quiz. Sure it doesn't seem like much, but my grandkids LOVE quizzes. So after they pass the quiz, you can print out a cool certificate from the DVD (in pdf format) and fill in each kid's name.  There is a newer version of this DVD and I read it is NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AND NOT RECOMMENDED. So stick with this one. Every kid doesn't like everything, but this was a big hit with my grandkids (and me!).",5,My grandkids loved it (6 and 7 year olds) and me too,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,1486,"['have', 'been', 'learning', 'solar', 'system', 'work', 'NASA', 'granddaughter', 'kindergarten', 'just', 'turned', '6', '7', 'year', 'old', 'grandson', 'blind', 'have', 'been', 'learning', 'lot', 'planets', 'Sun', 'gravity', 'space', 'etc', 'Anyway', 'love', 'DVD', 'had', 'buy', 'used', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'new', 'one', 'was', 'perfect', 'kid', 'animation', 'adventure', 'boy', 'spaceship', 'meets', 'planets', 'solar', 'system', 'planet', 'sings', 'phenomenal', 'how', 'easy', 'songs', 'make', 'remember', 'information', 'planets', 'grandkids', 'watched', 'few', 'times', 'knew', 'most', 'words', 'songs', 'THEY', 'LOVED', 'IT', 'Seriously', 'granddaughter', 'said', 'DVD', 'now', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'take', 'school', 'as', 'well', 'now', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'been', 'favorite', 'life', 'Also', 'grandson', 'loved', 'spending', 'few', 'weeks', 'learning', 'solar', 'system', 'variety', 'formats', 'was', 'least', 'dry', 'hilarious', 'lively', 'blast', 'grandson', 'songs', 'Then', 'DVD', '5-question', 'quiz', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'grandkids', 'LOVE', 'quizzes', 'So', 'pass', 'quiz', 'can', 'print', 'out', 'cool', 'certificate', 'DVD', 'pdf', 'format', 'fill', 'kid', 'name', 'newer', 'version', 'DVD', 'read', 'NOT', 'EXACTLY', 'THE', 'SAME', 'AND', 'NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'So', 'stick', 'one', 'kid', ""n't"", 'like', 'everything', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'grandkids']",My Fantastic Field Trip to the Planets

He LOVES it and I'll admit I've also been re-introduced to some long-lost solar system facts.  We watch this often and the songs are catchy (which I find myself humming all day long).  I hope to find more videos for this age range that educate and entertain kids in regard to the solar system.  I'm very happy with this purchase.,5,VERY COOL!,1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,439,"['almost', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'been', 'showing', 'huge', 'interest', 'solar', 'system', 'purchased', 'video', 'LOVES', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 're-introduced', 'long-lost', 'solar', 'system', 'facts', 'watch', 'often', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'find', 'humming', 'day', 'long', 'hope', 'find', 'more', 'videos', 'age', 'range', 'educate', 'entertain', 'kids', 'regard', 'solar', 'system', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'purchase']",My Fantastic Field Trip to the Planets

We were lucky enough to get an advance copy through a friend who works for a local newspaper.  My four-year-old and seven-year-old watch this DVD over and over again.  They love the adventure and the wonderful songs.  My husband and I love the fact that they now know all the planets and details that even we didn't know!  The planets are funny characters that come to life with some pretty amazing-looking special effects.  Because the planets are so fun and captivating my kids totally know these planets like they are their best friends.  It's so gratifying for my husband and me to hear them sing along with the film and have so much fun. There is even an interactive space quiz after the film that my kids love to take.  When they answered all the questions correctly, we printed out their ""Certificates of Merit"" that are on the DVD and can be customized on the computer with your child's name and the date.  Very cool!  My children keep these awards in their rooms and really feel a proud sense of accomplishment.  Very cute!  The songs are so catchy that I caught my husband singing ""THE PLANET SONG"" in the shower.  The bonus footage from NASA was great, too.  This is definitely one of those special DVDs that children will watch repeatedly and is a wonderful addition to our family DVD collection.  I think that, throughout their lives, our children will always be able to put a face to the planets and, in so doing, really remember them.  I highly recommend this DVD!
