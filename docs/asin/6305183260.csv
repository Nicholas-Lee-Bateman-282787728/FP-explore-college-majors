453703,A3EY1CA1C5PCNF,6305183260,A Customer,"[3, 4]","First the DVD review: DVD is awesome! This is everything, without question, a DVD should be! Studios shouldn't even consider releasing a movie on DVD unless it has extras like this one has! You get the following: THX Certified 1.85:1 Widescreen Enhanced Transfer, Commentary by director John Hough, 2 Alternate Endings, John Hough Bio, Theatrical Trailers &amp; TV Spots, 20 page Booklet with Interviews, Rare Artwork, Stills, and a world class performance from Bette Davis!We have owned this movie since it came out on Disney home video back in the early 80's. Say what you want about Disney live action movies but without question the one thing you can't say is they are not original movies! There is just nothing else like old Disney live action movies! I LOVE them! Yes, this movie is scary!Now, about Anchor Bay. I appreciate the fact that Anchor Bay has put out a lot of the Disney live action movies. I really do! Without Anchor Bay we wouldn't have the DVD releases of not only this movie but The Cat From Outer Space, The Last Flight of Noah's Ark, The Black Hole, The Devil and Max Devlin, Condorman, and many more! My problem with them is these are very limited releases and go out of print at the speed of light! Why? I suspect either they didn't anticipate a demand for these great movies or they are trying to set a &quot;you better get it now&quot; standard for other DVD companies to follow. They would make more money if they just kept these DVD's available for longer than a year. Look at the release date on this DVD. April 2002. C'mon, what is THAT all about? Now, for those that missed or didn't even know this DVD was released they are forced to pay twice what it is worth. Sounds like the only people making money off this are the resellers and not Anchor Bay.You can go to the Anchor Bay website and send them an email and ask the same questions I pose here, but they will ignore you!",5,Bone to pick with Anchor Bay,1074556800,"01 20, 2004",2004,1908,"['First', 'DVD', 'review', 'DVD', 'awesome', 'everything', 'question', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'Studios', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'releasing', 'movie', 'DVD', 'extras', 'one', 'get', 'following', 'THX', 'Certified', '1.85:1', 'Widescreen', 'Enhanced', 'Transfer', 'Commentary', 'director', 'John', 'Hough', '2', 'Alternate', 'Endings', 'John', 'Hough', 'Bio', 'Theatrical', 'Trailers', 'amp', 'TV', 'Spots', '20', 'page', 'Booklet', 'Interviews', 'Rare', 'Artwork', 'Stills', 'world', 'class', 'performance', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'have', 'owned', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'Disney', 'home', 'video', 'back', 'early', '80', 'Say', 'what', 'want', 'Disney', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'question', 'one', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', 'not', 'original', 'movies', 'just', 'nothing', 'else', 'old', 'Disney', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'LOVE', 'Yes', 'movie', 'scary', 'Now', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'put', 'out', 'lot', 'Disney', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'really', 'do', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'DVD', 'releases', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'Cat', 'From', 'Outer', 'Space', 'Last', 'Flight', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'Black', 'Hole', 'Devil', 'Max', 'Devlin', 'Condorman', 'many', 'more', 'problem', 'are', 'very', 'limited', 'releases', 'go', 'print', 'speed', 'light', 'Why', 'suspect', 'did', ""n't"", 'anticipate', 'demand', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'trying', 'set', 'quot', 'better', 'get', 'now', 'quot', 'standard', 'other', 'DVD', 'companies', 'follow', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'just', 'kept', 'DVD', 'available', 'longer', 'year', 'Look', 'release', 'date', 'DVD', 'April', '2002', ""C'mon"", 'what', 'Now', 'missed', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'are', 'forced', 'pay', 'twice', 'what', 'worth', 'Sounds', 'only', 'people', 'making', 'money', 'are', 'resellers', 'not', 'Anchor', 'Bay.You', 'can', 'go', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'website', 'send', 'email', 'ask', 'same', 'questions', 'pose', 'here', 'will', 'ignore']",N/A

Watcher in the woods proves that it isn't what you see that scares you, it is what you don't know. Example being Blair witch, or Jaws, or Jurassic Park. This really is a great thriller that will hopefully show up on DVD. I watched this film's first half when I was ten, but I had to go to the store with my parents, missing the conclusion. A while back I had a chance to rent this film, and I wasn't let down one bit!!! Even with an 8 year wait, I wasn't! That should tell you something about this films effect. You wonder what I am gabbing about?? The mystery for one thing. There really is something in the woods! What is it, and what is it hiding from? And there remains a hidden secret that trapped a child in glass for decades. Her haunting's make you really want more. She appears in mirrors blind folded, to beg for help from a disappearing reflection. 4 1/2 strong stars. Very Spooky to this day! See it with your older kids.

When I stumbled upon The Watcher in the Woods while searching for her classic titles on Amazon, I knew I had to see it. I was a kid when this flick hit movie theaters in 1981, but don't remember a thing about it - and my Mother doesn't remember it, either. We were stunned at just how good it is. Subtle, spooky, with great acting and fitting music, The Watcher in the Woods relies on plot to drive viewers to the end - not blood and gore.The film is subtly suspenseful, but not suspenseful in the nail-biting sense many expect today. The movie is kid-friendly. You cannot miss a moment, otherwise you might miss an interesting or important detail in the ghostly hauntings of the English manor where a young girl disappeared years ago.The DVD offers two alternate endings. It's a good thing Disney went with the ending it did. These tried to tap into the market forAlien (The Director's Cut), which came out in 1979, according to IMDB.

453720,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6305183260,Byron Kolln,"[22, 25]","Based on the novel by Florence Engel Randall, THE WATCHER IN THE WOODS is a finely-crafted Disney thriller with Bette Davis and a great cast.The story is about an English-American family (David McCallum, Carroll Baker, Lynn-Holly Johnson and Kyle Richards) who move into a creepy mansion in the English countryside.  The estate also includes Mrs Aylwood (Bette Davis) who acts as a caretaker of sorts.  Mrs Aylwood's daughter Karen mysteriously died in a fire many years ago and she has never really come to terms with her grief.Once the new family moves in, strange things begin to occur.  Eldest daughter Jan (Lynn-Holly Johnson - ICE CASTLES) senses something watching her, and starts seeing a blindfolded girl in mirrors.  Younger daughter Ellie (Kyle Richards) adopts a little dog and calls it 'Nerak' ('Karen' spelled backwards).  Everything that happens seems to lead back to Karen Aylwood and her mysterious death.  Jan and Ellie join Mrs Aylwood in a race against time to stop the hauntings and hopefully find out what really happened that fateful night...Bette Davis gives a mesmerizing performance as Mrs Aylwood (with Georgina Hale also fine as the younger Davis during the flashback sequence).  David McCallum sadly doesn't get much to do as the father, though Carroll Baker impresses in her relatively-small role as the mother.  Lynn-Holly Johnson (following her breakout role as Lexie in ICE CASTLES) is a knockout as Jan and Kyle Richards is just plain spooky as Ellie.Filmed entirely on location in England, the tense and eerie atmosphere is perfectly carried throughout the whole movie.

Get it?  Watcher?  Eyes?  The Kim Carnes song?  A bad joke?  Yes it was, but I was stumped for a way to start my review, and inspiration seems to have failed me yet again...The Watcher in the Woods (1981), released by Disney, directed by Englishman John Hough, who also did Escape to Witch Mountain (1975) Return from Witch Mountain (1978), and a couple of episodes for television program Hammer House of Mystery, stars Bette Davis, Lynn-Holly Johnson, who also appeared in films like Ice Castles (1978) and the James Bond film For Your Eyes Only (1981) (the early 80's were pretty good for Johnson, but her career has since taken a detour in the land of the B movies), and Kyle Richards, who started out on the television show Little House on the Prairie, but then moved to major horror features appearing in The Car aka Deathmobile, John Carpenter's Halloween, and its' sequel Halloween II.  Also appearing are Carroll Baker (Baba Yaga) and David McCallum, probably most known as secret agent Illya Kuryakin from the popular 60's television series The Man from U.N.C.L.E.The film begins with an American family, recently re-located to England, looking for a home.  McCallum plays the father, Baker the mother, and Johnson and Richards as the two daughters.  They find a real deal in an old English manor, owned by a peculiar old woman named Mrs. Alywood (Davis), who happens to live in a smaller house on the property, and is very particular about who rents the larger house, but, on meeting Jan (Johnson), and her younger sister Ellie (Richards), she agrees to allow the family to rent the place.  Even before the family moves in, Jan has uneasy feelings about the place, almost like she's being watched (hence the title), and soon afterwards, begins experiencing strange and odd visions, visions regarding Mrs. Alywood's long, lost daughter, missing now for some 30 years.  As the visions progress to other, more intense supernatural phenomena, Jan feels compelled to learn the true nature of what's happening to her and her sister, and also to learn the truth about Mrs. Alywood's missing daughter.  What terrible secrets does she uncover?  Who is the watcher in the woods?  Why's that Mrs. Alywood so very creepy?  Answers to these questions and more are forthcoming, if you care to watch...(who watches the watcher?  I did, and it was pretty good...)When I purchased this film, I didn't know it was a Disney release.  As another reviewer already stated, Disney had an odd period there for awhile, releasing films that didn't necessarily seem very Disney-like, like this film.  I actually liked the movie a lot, as it was very suspenseful and I honestly could not figure out the ending until it was revealed.  I will admit I found myself somewhat attracted to Johnson, and it felt odd as she seemed to be presented as someone in her teens, but in reality, she was in her early 20's at the time this was filmed, so I felt a lot less creepy.  I did think she seemed a bit too old for her part, and after checking on her age, my feelings were confirmed.  All the actors did very well, and given their collected past acting experiences, I wasn't surprised.  Whoever casted this film did very well, choosing highly capable and experienced actors.  Johnson's character did become a bit of a pest as the film worn on, especially as she tries to uncover the dark secrets that now seem to plague her and her sister in visions and the odd possession or two.  Davis' character seemed a bit weak and two dimensional, but one is willing to cut the woman some slack, given her body of work, and those very creepy eyes.  The sets and location shots all added a great deal to the story, providing a wonderful backdrop to the story.  I did find it kind of annoying when Johnson's character kept looking out various windows, as if she could see whatever strange force keeps causing the wee hairs on the back of her neck to stand up...The script was very well done, and tended to focus on the important elements, keeping the viewer in the thick of things.  The plot moved along very slowly, almost excruciatingly so, but it did allow for the viewer to ponder and develop their own theories, which will most likely be wrong, as I was...the ending in this film was so very oddly fantastic I doubt I would have ever figured it out on my own.  Some may have already given it away in reviews here, which is too bad, as it's pretty mind-boggling.  It really seemed to come from nowhere, but did provide a satisfactory, if highly unusual conclusion.The wide screen print here is very clear and sharp, along with the audio, although the DTS track on the earlier Anchor Bay release (now out of print) is missing here.  There are a few extras on this official Walt Disney Home Video release (although less than there were on the pervious Anchor Bay release), including two alternate endings well worth checking out, and two trailers.  After watching the alternate endings, I would think they weren't used maybe because they would have been too frightening to younger viewers, or too goofy for older viewers.  The ending used in the final product, compared to the alternates, seems the best route to have been taken.  Overall, this is a very good thriller, one that forsakes visceral elements for story and genuine suspense.  It moves a bit slow, but does reward at the end.  It is a Disney film, but probably not one for very young viewers, as it could cause nightmares and the subsequent staining of the sheets.Cookieman108",4,Something Is Watching.

453724,A2SXQBMWCYNMX7,6305183260,D. C. Mappin,"[2, 2]","I've loved this movie ever since I saw its first release back in the early 1980s! It is, to me, the perfect type of horror flick. It is genuinely creepy without the overdose of profanity, blood, guts and gore so typical of today's genre films. The creepy atmosphere of the film's location adds much to the suspense of the film. I would not spend one moment in the house in which they reside.What I like about the film is the despair that Bette Davis' character feels after losing her daughter without a trace some 25 years earlier. This is not just a horror flick, but a mystery film as well; every moment Ms. Davis is on screen her sadness is conveyed with skill. I cannot imagine the pain of losing a child, but in this film's case she was not even afforded the simple knowledge of knowing what led to her daughter Karen's disappearance. Actually, I like all of the performances in this film, although I think a few of the scenes feel a bit forced.Another aspect that is quite effective are the use of wide angle lens whenever the ""watcher"" is present. All in all, each of the film's elements including the sound and special effects add immensely to the creep-out factor of this movie. I noticed some of the other reviewers here feel the ending was a bit of a letdown. I totally disagree! The hairs on my arms stand up every time I see the film's climax. I actually get goosebumps watching the final moments.This is the kind of horror film that I like best (much like George C. Scott's 'The Changeling,' also released around the same time). 'Watcher in the Woods' is creepy and scary, yet not to the point that I wouldn't be able to sleep afterwards. This may not sound like a compliment (but it is), this is a great (safe) horror flick! It can be enjoyed by young teens and adults as well.

453726,A1EQ35NR4CZL6Y,6305183260,Dmarkwind,"[0, 0]","I recall having seen this film when it first came out in 1980. I was about 15 and it was... not scary, not engaging and not so great. The biggest impression it left is that it was kinda dull. It just kind of faded into that lineup of lesser Disney films from the Ron Miller era when Walt&#8217;s son-in-law was president/CEO at Disney from 1978 to 1983.For me, it fell right in there with movies like &#8220;Condorman.&#8221; &#8220;The Devil and Max Devlin,&#8221; Herbie Goes Bananas,&#8221; &#8220;The Black Cauldron,&#8221; and &#8220;The Last Flight of Noah&#8217;s Ark.&#8221; There were bright spots like &#8220;Tron,&#8221; and &#8220;The Fox and the Hound,&#8221; but they weren&#8217;t enough and this wasn&#8217;t one of them. Under Miller&#8217;s leadership, the company became the target of corporate raiders and he was eventually ousted by Disney family member Roy E. Disney in favor of Michael Eisner, Frank Wells, and Jeffrey Katzenberg.Heres&#8217; the short version of the film&#8217;s plot: an American family moves into an English cottage in a wooded area and strange things begin happening to 17-year old daughter Jan and 10-year old Ellie. Jan eventually figures out it has something to do with the disappearance 30 years earlier of the property owner&#8217;s daughter and takes it upon herself to investigate. And, oh yeah, something watching them - from the woods.Anyway, I was hoping that not having seen this film for more than 30 years, it would strike me differently now, but not so much. It&#8217;s no fun, takes itself way too seriously (there&#8217;s pretty much no humor in it), and takes me nowhere worth going. It tries to walk the supernatural chiller/horror route, but really doesn&#8217;t get there, has poor effects and the muddled explanation of the titular &#8220;Watcher&#8221; ultimately makes no sense. This film has all the trappings of a ghost story, but devolves into something else.From the DVD artwork for the 2010 release, you&#8217;d think the story revolves around screen legend Bette Davis, who was celebrating her 50th year in films with this outing. As it turns out, as the property owner, she&#8217;s an important but not central character and she looks bored most of the time here.On paper, the rest of the cast looks great as well.  Playing the dad is David McCallum, who is known as both agent Ilya Kuryakin from the 1960s TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and more recently as Dr. Donald &#8220;Duckie&#8221; Mallard on the series &#8220;NCIS.&#8221; Portraying the mom is Carroll Baker, an accomplished actress with more than 80 film and television credits stretching from 1952 to 2003 including the movie &#8220;Giant&#8221; with James Dean in 1956, and &#8220;Kindergarten Cop&#8221; with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1990. The problem is that none of these folks really has a lot to do or is even on screen all that much. Instead the film rests on the shoulders of Holly Lynn-Johnson, who plays Jan and who is best known as the teenaged ice skater who tries unsuccessfully to seduce Roger Moore&#8217;s James Bond in 1981&#8217;s &#8220;For You Eyes Only.&#8221; She is also known for 1978&#8217;s &#8220;Ice Castles.&#8221; It&#8217;s sad to say, but Lynn-Johnson isn&#8217;t a strong enough actress to carry this film and by the end, I just found her annoying.Director John Hough had a long career and previously helmed some bona fide hits including the  &#8220;The Legend of Hell House&#8221; and Disney&#8217;s two &#8220;Witch Mountain&#8221; movies about young aliens trying to find their way home. Some critics list &#8220;Watcher&#8221; as the beginning of a fatlering of his track record but note he came back with 1982&#8217;s &#8220;The Incubus.&#8221;In addition to the theatrical version of the film, this DVD includes two alternate endings, which give a more physical form to the watcher than what was seen in theaters, but still aren&#8217;t very satisfying. Those endings and two theatrical trailers are the extent of the special features here.This film might pacify and possibily even scare younger children for 90 minutes or so,  but my advise it to avoid these woods, as there&#8217;s better choices out there.",2,Definitely a lesser Disney flick from the Ron Miller era,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,4188,"['recall', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1980', 'was', 'about', '15', 'was', 'not', 'scary', 'not', 'engaging', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'biggest', 'impression', 'left', 'was', 'kinda', 'dull', 'just', 'kind', 'faded', 'lineup', 'lesser', 'Disney', 'films', 'Ron', 'Miller', 'era', 'when', 'Walt', '8217', 's', 'son-in-law', 'was', 'president/CEO', 'Disney', '1978', '1983.For', 'fell', 'right', 'movies', '8220', 'Condorman.', '8221', '8220', 'Devil', 'Max', 'Devlin', '8221', 'Herbie', 'Goes', 'Bananas', '8221', '8220', 'Black', 'Cauldron', '8221', '8220', 'Last', 'Flight', 'Noah', '8217', 'Ark.', '8221', 'were', 'bright', 'spots', '8220', 'Tron', '8221', '8220', 'Fox', 'Hound', '8221', 'weren', '8217', 'enough', 'wasn', '8217', 'one', 'Miller', '8217', 's', 'leadership', 'company', 'became', 'target', 'corporate', 'raiders', 'was', 'eventually', 'ousted', 'Disney', 'family', 'member', 'Roy', 'E.', 'Disney', 'favor', 'Michael', 'Eisner', 'Frank', 'Wells', 'Jeffrey', 'Katzenberg.Heres', '8217', 'short', 'version', 'film', '8217', 'plot', 'American', 'family', 'moves', 'English', 'cottage', 'wooded', 'area', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happening', '17-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Jan', '10-year', 'old', 'Ellie', 'Jan', 'eventually', 'out', 'something', 'do', 'disappearance', '30', 'years', 'earlier', 'property', 'owner', '8217', 'daughter', 'investigate', 'oh', 'yeah', 'something', 'watching', 'woods.Anyway', 'was', 'hoping', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'more', '30', 'years', 'would', 'strike', 'differently', 'now', 'not', 'so', 'much', '8217', 'fun', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', '8217', 's', 'pretty', 'much', 'humor', 'nowhere', 'worth', 'going', 'walk', 'supernatural', 'chiller/horror', 'route', 'really', 'doesn', '8217', 'get', 'there', 'poor', 'effects', 'muddled', 'explanation', 'titular', '8220', 'Watcher', '8221', 'ultimately', 'sense', 'film', 'trappings', 'ghost', 'story', 'something', 'DVD', 'artwork', '2010', 'release', '8217', 'think', 'story', 'around', 'screen', 'legend', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'who', 'was', 'celebrating', '50th', 'year', 'films', 'outing', 'out', 'property', 'owner', '8217', 'important', 'not', 'central', 'character', 'bored', 'most', 'time', 'here.On', 'paper', 'rest', 'cast', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'Playing', 'dad', 'David', 'McCallum', 'who', 'known', 'agent', 'Ilya', 'Kuryakin', '1960s', 'TV', 'series', 'Man', 'U.N.C.L.E', 'more', 'recently', 'Dr.', 'Donald', '8220', 'Duckie', '8221', 'Mallard', 'series', '8220', 'NCIS.', '8221', 'Portraying', 'mom', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'accomplished', 'actress', 'more', '80', 'film', 'television', 'credits', 'stretching', '1952', '2003', 'including', 'movie', '8220', 'Giant', '8221', 'James', 'Dean', '1956', '8220', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', '8221', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', '1990', 'problem', 'none', 'folks', 'really', 'lot', 'do', 'even', 'screen', 'much', 'Instead', 'film', 'shoulders', 'Holly', 'Lynn-Johnson', 'who', 'Jan', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'teenaged', 'ice', 'skater', 'who', 'unsuccessfully', 'seduce', 'Roger', 'Moore', '8217', 'James', 'Bond', '1981', '8217', '8220', 'Eyes', 'Only.', '8221', 'also', 'known', '1978', '8217', '8220', 'Ice', 'Castles.', '8221', '8217', 'sad', 'say', 'Lynn-Johnson', 'isn', '8217', 'strong', 'enough', 'actress', 'carry', 'film', 'end', 'just', 'found', 'annoying.Director', 'John', 'Hough', 'had', 'long', 'career', 'previously', 'helmed', 'bona', 'fide', 'hits', 'including', '8220', 'Legend', 'Hell', 'House', '8221', 'Disney', '8217', 'two', '8220', 'Witch', 'Mountain', '8221', 'movies', 'young', 'aliens', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'critics', 'list', '8220', 'Watcher', '8221', 'beginning', 'fatlering', 'track', 'record', 'note', 'came', 'back', '1982', '8217', '8220', 'Incubus.', '8221', 'addition', 'theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'DVD', 'two', 'alternate', 'endings', 'give', 'more', 'physical', 'form', 'watcher', 'what', 'was', 'seen', 'theaters', 'still', 'aren', '8217', 'very', 'satisfying', 'endings', 'two', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'are', 'extent', 'special', 'features', 'here.This', 'film', 'might', 'pacify', 'possibily', 'even', 'scare', 'younger', 'children', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'advise', 'avoid', 'woods', '8217', 'better', 'choices', 'out', 'there']",N/A

Hopson ""StarWatcher""","[0, 1]","""The Watcher in the Woods"" is a first rate suspense movie that can also be enjoyed by young viewers, thanks to the film's creators at Disney.  Lynn Holly Johnson teams up with Kyle Richards (Kim Richards' real life sister)  as sisters that move into an English mansion with their parents for the summer.  Strange things begin to happen, even on the day that they're moving in.  Lynn is determined to unravel the mystery that is beginning to haunt her and Kyle.  Bette Davis co-stars as a mysterious elderly lady that lives in the guesthouse of the estate, and Lynn soon discovers that all of the supernatural phenomenon that's been occurring surrounds the disappearance of Davis' long lost daughter.  The dvd has a nice clean transfer and great audio.  Special features include the film's original trailer and a nice addition of alternate endings to the film.  Also of special merit, is the co-starring of Carroll Baker (Baby Doll, Giant, The Carpetbaggers) as Lynn and Kyle's mother.  I highly recommend ""The Watcher in the Woods"" to fans of suspense and the supernatural, and especially to Disney live-action film enthusiasts.

For a Disney flick, there are a couple of ""jump out of your seat"" moments.Bette Davis is formidable as usual and Lynn-Holly Johnson does a great job, but it's Kyle Richards who essentially steals the show, sublimely transitioning from innocent little sister to taking on another voice.  If you notice the timing of the movie, it came out shortly after the Exorcist and the Shining.  Therefore, there are few elements in Watcher in the Woods that pays a bit of homage to these flicks like writing backwards on mirrors.  Of course, Hough had to keep the spook factor to a family-friendly minimum. Other highlights of this movie, is the camera angle used to enhance the effect of the main characters being ""watched"".This is, by far, Disney's edgiest film. Yet, it's still clean enough to be family entertainment.  Unlike the ""Witch Mountain"" films, ""Watcher"" has few special effects but are nonethelesss key to the story and the suspense.The DVD doesn't offer any behind-the-scenes commentaries, but it does offer two alternate endings which are not too different from each other.

I was okay with about an hour and ten minutes of this movie.  It was the last ten minutes that i cant accept.Basic setup, a family moves into an old house or manor, whatever youd like to call the large thing.  The two daughters begin to tap into the spirits around the place.  The oldest daughter seeing images of the girl who was lost long ago while the younger daughter gets used as a channeling board for the spirits.A good mystery is developed, only to fall apart in the end.  I felt mind raped straight through my ear.  I kept coming up with possibilities for what it might be and what it was i never would have guessed, mainly because i wasnt pitching from the parking lot.  The idea the story ended with wasnt even on the movies playing field.The directors commentary offered no insight into this.  All he did was tell how a shot was done, tell you what was going on in a scene (which you could tell by WATCHING the damn thing!), or bitch about his ending being better than the one they went with.  The dvd i had had ""two"" alternate endings on it but they were pretty much the same thing.  ###And for some reason the actress they had playing the grown up little girl looked like a man in a wig???###I realized later that this movie was based off of a book, which i suppose lets the director off the hook for not telling me why the ending of the movie was so different.  Perhaps the book did a better job at transitioning the reader from one aspect of the story to the next because this movie just throws it at you and expects you to catch it, even if you dont have any hands.This entire paragraph is a ### so you might wanna skip it.  The idea behind Karens dissapearance is that these young people, playing what i assumed was a prank because they were initiating her into their group, was actually some kind of witchcraft...somehow.  The youngest girl comes in at the end, possesed by The Watcher.  Turns out Karen was sucked into an alternate dimension and switched places with this Watcher, whatever it is.  Oh wait, its some kind of alien!  The deleted endings show this creature which is quite menacing.  Its just the idea of this character, after expecting a ghost story and getting an alien, that i have a problem with.  The alternate endings also try to explain what happened to Karen, adding in things about negative energies and whatnot which really only make the idea more retarded. Explaining the specifics breifly (as the possessed little girl does) was the best route. I thought perhaps whoever wrote the book had an episode of Star Trek on in the background when writing this ending and decided that was a cool idea to go with.###For the most part i have no problem referring this movie.  Just know that the payoff in the end leaves quite a bit to be desired.  Oh and some of the acting is horrible.

Though, if you think about it, Disney was always pretty willing to include scary elements in both its animated and live-action movies, so this initiative really wasn't much of a stretch.  The great Bette Davis lends additional credibility to this modest but well-crafted film via her fairly small but nicely-performed role as the grieving mother of a long-lost child.  The DVD I saw included the two alternate endings described by other Amazon reviewers.  They're interesting to see, but the ending attached to the film- though it IS somewhat abrupt- is probably the best of all the conclusions.

453747,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6305183260,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[5, 5]","It seems unlikely that ""Watcher in the Woods"" would be made for theatrical release today.  While the movie may be frightening for younger audiences, it is but spooky for older audiences and the ending has a little bit of weakness, even with the re-vamping indicated by the alternative endings provided on the DVD.Lynn-Holly Johnson, whose most notable roles were in ""Ice Castles"" with Robbie Benson and the Bond film ""For Your Eyes Only,"" little sister Kyle Richards and their family move to a beautiful English country home when their father, played by David McCallum of ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" and ""The Invisible Man"" television series fame, is transferred to England.  The family soon encounters ever-eerie Bette Davis as an appropriately scary old lady who does little speaking but looks at the new family intently (and an intent look from Bette Davis in her latter years was always scary).  It takes a while for Lynn-Holly Johnson to learn why Davis, playing Mrs. Aylwood, looks at her so intently.It takes very little time for strange things to start happening to little sister Kyle Richards, who was also on the television series ""Little House on the Prairie.""  Kyle writes ""Nerak"" on a window and names her dog the same, not realizing that Nerak has a very special meaning to Mrs. Aylwood.  Kyle writes on mirrors and says strange things.  Lynn-Holly Johnson hears strange voices and has visual hallucinations, which are also eerie and just shy of being scary.The suspense in this movie is increased slowly but steadily to the climax, when we learn the secret of three people who met in an abandoned church many years earlier, and even then we wonder at the plot twist Disney put into the end of the picture.The pre-digital age special effects are seamless and effective.  This movie maximized the use of minimal special effects to create a movie that is just shy of being scary for adult audiences, but is eerie and spooky to the end.  There are a couple of moments when I was concerned that Lynn-Holly Johnson might be harmed when I was still unsure of whether the ghost or whatever it was evil.  The ""possessions"" of younger sister Kyle Richards were even spookier, especially because she seemed to be unaware of each time she did something under the control of the other being.  The most effective and perhaps one of the weirdest moments in the movie is when Kyle is speaking under the control of something when she enters the church near the end of the movie.  The style of her speaking is effective and is probably one of the high points of the movie.Included on this DVD are two alternate endings.  One is a bit more than 13 minutes long and the other is just over 6 minutes long.  Watch the long alternate ending, then the shorter one, and then that used in the movie, and you can see the logic the producer used in modifying the ending.In the original ending the plot has an interesting creature that distracts rather than enhances the plot.  There are more details added in regarding this being that change the tenor of the movie in a much less effective manner than the final version.  The shorter version retained a portion of the much longer version, but again the ending distracts rather than enhances the movie.  The final version where the unknown is used to the point where the nature of Kyle's possession is revealed is the most effective version.  One other problem with both the alternate endings is Bette Davis's over-the-top acting, which caused a lot of laughs.  The final version was more effective.This movie pushes the envelope of what it means to be a Disney made movie, which are stereotypically family oriented.  Later Disney created other studios to produce films that were unsuitable for all or most family members and resolved the problem of how to make more intense movies.  However, this movie is suitable for most children above the age of 8 or 9 and for some more mature younger children.  There are few moments of any real danger, but those few moments and the overall eerie feeling of the movie can cause nightmares for some children.The DVD also includes trailers, and there appeared to me to be at least a portion of the movie that did not make the final version in at least one of the trailers.While this movie has some weak points, the overall style is like that of the short-live television series ""American Gothic,"" though much less violent and bloody, and fans of that style or those looking for a relatively family friendly ghost story will find this movie to be worth watching and owning.",4,Spooky but only a little scary,1100822400,"11 19, 2004",2004,4545,"['unlikely', 'Watcher', 'Woods', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'theatrical', 'release', 'today', 'movie', 'may',

Daughter Jan (Lynn-Holly Johnson) sees things.  When she touches glass it breaks into a triangle.  When she looks into an old dresser mirror, she cannot see her reflection.  When she touches it it cracks into a triangle.  And in the triangle she can see the reflection of a blindfolded girl.That night she is awoken by her sister Ellie's sleeptalking.  But Ellie (Kyle Richards) tells Jan it was her that was talking.The next day the girls are visiting a farm and Ellen in a trance writes NERAK on the barn window.  From the other side it reads Karen and Mrs. Fleming becomes disturbed by this.  Back at home, Ellie is drawn into the woods and Jan goes looking for her.  She finds Ellie by the pond.  The girls hear disembodied singing followed by a light flash and then a circle in the water.Jan falls into the pond and gets trapped by a branch underwater.  Mrs. Aylwood (Bette Davis) rescues her.  Jan tells her of what is happening.  Mrs. Aylwood tells Jan about her daughter that disappeared 30 years ago.The following day, the family goes to a motorcross race.  Ellie starts to scream for Jan to come to her.  Moments later a motorycle goes off track and lands on the rock that Jan was standing on.The girls go horseback riding neighbor Mike (his mother was present whan Karen disappeared.)  Ellie's horse bolts and Mike goes after her.  Jan's horse gets spooked takes her to the chapel where Karen disappeared.  She sees a trianglular light on a coffin and then Karen's image in the coffin.  While there a sudden gust blows out a window and two circular panes of glass fall at her feet, one with a sunburst being covered by a dark piece of glass.Next Jan is in a house of mirrors and suddenly every reflection is of the blindfolded Karen. Jan decides to find out what happened the night that Karen Aylwood disappeared.  John Keller tells her to leave it alone.  But Tom Colley tells her want happened.  That Karen during an initation the chapel was struck by lightning and caught on fire.  The three ran leaving the blindfolded Karen alone.  Tom turned around and saw the tower bell fall but Karen had already gone.Mrs. Curtis (Carroll Baker) tries to take the girls away from the house but the woods stop them, setting up the rescue of Karen.This was part of Disney studio trying to change its image from low budget family orient films to a more main stream films.  This film was left on the shelf for over a year before they reshot the end and released it.This film is very interesting and despite some minor story flaws and rather rudimentary special effects (even for those days), this film is enjoyable for the entire family.By the way Kyle Richards looks incredibly like her more famous sister Kim Richards.  And it is great seeing Carroll Baker working again.DVD EXTRASAlternate Ending #1 (6:32) - this gives a form to the watcher - which looks like something from Alien.

453760,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6305183260,Nix Pix,"[1, 6]","In the late 1970s the Walt Disney Studios was a kingdom of make believe perilously perched on the verge of extinction, thanks in part to changing audience tastes and, to a series of high profile big budget flops. While some of these, like ""Pete's Dragon"" have since been given their reprieve on home video, the proliferation of others to the home market, ""The Watcher In The Woods"" being a prime example, seems only to heighten the overwhelming loss of artistic sensibility that plagued decision making at the studio during its dark and gloomy transition period. Worried that the market for family film fare had been irreversibly eroded with the proliferation of more gritty adult flicks, Uncle Walt's heirs dove head first into more mature story telling - effectively alienating both its remaining loyalists and the conventional film attendee who had outgrown Mickey Mouse.""The Watcher In The Woods"" is a ghost story that begins in earnest with the greatest potential. It stars Bette Davis as Mrs. Aylwood, a reclusive landlord of an old English estate rented to the Curtis family: mom, Helen (Carroll Baker), dad, Paul (Peter McCallum) and their two daughters, Jan (Lynn-Holly Johnson) and Ellie (Kyle Richards). From the start Jan is in tune with some strange psychic forces haunting the house. She notices that a mirror above one of the fireplaces gives off no reflections of people and sometime provides a strange porthole image of a young girl who is blindfolded and reaching out for help. Jan also begins to suspect that some of the town's folk know exactly what's going on at their secluded country estate. Through a bit of her own investigating Jan learns that many years before Mrs. Aylwood's daughter disappeared without a trace from an abandoned church after three of her friends performed a paranormal sacrifice.In an off beat attempt to recapture some of the magic of earlier Disney-fied mystery flicks like ""Candleshoe,"" ""Watcher"" cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be an adult horror flick or a ""Freaky Friday"" comedic knock off with a feel good ending. There is something cinematically insincere about the way in which the film introduces Peter McCallum's character, Paul and then quickly jettisons him from the plot. Ultimately the focus shifts from family to daughters, Jan and Ellie.  To be certain there are disturbing vignettes and more than one good scare buried under the rubble of this lost opportunity. A perfect example occurs when Jan and Ellie wander off into the woods and stumble onto a gnarled tree stretching over a tiny pond. Ellie climbs one of the tree branches and accidentally falls into the water where she becomes trapped in a mirrored parallel universe. Frantically, Jan uses a broken tree branch to free and restore her sister to safety but not before the mirror produces a glimpse of the blindfolded girl, reflecting back at her with a look of desperation about her silenced lips.The primary problem with ""Watcher"" is that it stumbles upon its frightening moments almost by accident and then does not know how to either successfully link the moments into one cohesive narrative or bring about a logical ending to the whole darn mess. In 1980, with a rush release date pushing the production onward to completion, director, Richard Hough slapped together some sort of ending in which an alien creature has been keeping Mrs. Aylwood's daughter a captive in a computer generated alter-universe ever since the ritual sacrifice. Reportedly laughed off the screen at a New York premiere, Hough cut together a version in which Jan is sucked into a vortex. She rescues the girl from her prism prison by doing battle with something in the vane of a Jim Henson puppet back lit by phosphorus effects as the creature responsible for the girl's disappearance. Ultimately, only Jan and a truncated version of the vortex finale eventually was released to the general public with the return of Aylwood's daughter surfacing as something of a tacky, tactless tack-on that betrayed both the gothic mystery of the rest of the film and the Disney legacy for crafting vintage family entertainment. The film was a box office bomb in 1981 but ironically has resurfaces as something of a cult classic.Disney DVD gives us an identical anamorphic widescreen DVD transfer to the one previously made available from Anchor Bay. Though the main title sequence is riddled with age related artifacts and dirt and scratches, once the film begins the overall picture quality is fairly pleasing and easy on the eyes. The use of soft filters renders many scenes a hazy fuzzy mess of warm colors but this is not the fault of DVD mastering efforts. Colors are overall rich and vibrant, though some slight smearing is present during night scenes. The effects photography does not hold up well under this sort of pristine digital scrutiny, appearing very one dimensional and almost pasted on as an afterthought. Contrast levels are overall quite good though blacks are rarely solid or deep. There's minor edge enhancement present also as well as some heavy pixelization in various scenes. The audio has been cleaned up and is presented at a reasonable listening level. It is dated but adequate. Extras include an audio commentary in which director, Hough laments being rushed to finish the picture, two alternative endings, a theatrical trailer and some stills. Bottom line is, if you're looking for the usual Disney perfection working overtime, look elsewhere.",3,A MISCALCULATION IN THE DISNEY CANON,1047859200,"03 17, 2003",2003,5472,"['late', '1970s',

However, I don't care for hard-core horror, so I'm sticking to only very slightly spooky films.  And so I've just viewed ""Watcher in the Woods,"" an old favourite from 1980.This picture has a lot of nostalgic appeal for me; I remember there was quite a lot of press about it as it was being filmed, because this was the very first time the Disney studio seemed to be attempting to do a film a bit more ""adult"" in nature, as compared to their usual output. Unfortunately, the film doesn't quite succeed, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth watching.It's marvellously atmospheric and spooky---great cinematography, fantastic eerie locations, good scary music. The problem comes in the last five minutes, which are a let-down after all the build-up. To be frank, the ending simply doesn't make any sense. (Let me tell you, ""magnetic pull of the eclipse"" is an absolutely meaningless nonsense phrase--drives me crazy!) And in fact the finale was always the problem with this film.Upon its initial release, all the critics took note of the bizarre ending, and the film was immediately pulled for retooling. After some additional shooting and editing, the film was re-released a year later; there was an improvement, but ---eh---the ending was still kind of iffy and a bit disappointing. Still... I can overlook that problem, because I enjoyed the earlier portions of the film so much. The DVD of ""Watcher in the Woods"" contains three different endings, and frankly none of them really work. The best solution, I think, would be to edit together portions of all three, for a new composite conclusion. However, what it all comes down to is problems with the script---problems that were quite unnecessary, in my opinion. I've read the book upon which the screenplay was based, and the mystery makes perfect sense at the end of the novel---it's a pretty cool concept. I don't know why on earth the writers of the film couldn't have stayed closer to this logical way of summing up the plot, for goodness sake.The acting talent on display in this picture is decidedly mixed. Kyle Richards (sister of big 1970's child star Kim Richards, who worked on a number of well-remembered films and television series) is cute as a button, but kind of annoying. Now, I don't want to sound too mean-spirited, but Lynn-Holly Johnson unfortunately displays no acting talent whatsoever, in my opinion. She plays every scene in the last two-thirds of the picture in full-blown-hysteria mode; more than a little grating! (Diane Lane was considered for this role, but she either turned it down, or was unavailable at the time.  It's kind of frustrating, thinking what a actress with Lane's skill could have done with the part.)  Benedict Taylor, as the potential love interest, is blondly dreamy (heh) in a 1970's teen-girl-magazine pin-up fashion.But of course the real honours here go to Bette Davis, who puts all others in the shade. She doesn't have much to do in the film, but is effective in her few scenes. Just look at her in the last scene: with one look and three simple words (the last words spoken in the film) she shows just what a great actress is capable of ---I found this moment very moving. A critic at the time spoke of how she ""made bricks without straw,"" meaning of course she rose far above the material she was given. This was the last theatrical feature she made, before she had the stroke which so drastically altered her speaking voice and appearance.So, the film has its problems, but I recommend it nonetheless, as a good spooky film for younger people. Heck, watching this at night, alone in a dark room, there are still moments that make me jump!Reading the comments about this film on the Internet Movie Database was fun; the comment you hear over and over is ""This film scared the **** out of me when I was a kid!"" Ha! Several people, in fact, said that to this day they will not sleep in a room containing a mirror because this film scared them so much when they were young.When looking for this film, definitely go for the Anchor Bay DVD release which contains supplemental material missing from the Disney release, including a commentary track from the director.",5,Flawed but fun!,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,4227,"['Holy', 'cow', 'Halloween', '-time', 'watch', 'scary', 'movies', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'hard-core', 'horror', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'only', 'very', 'slightly', 'spooky', 'films', 'so', ""'ve"", 'just', 'viewed', 'Watcher', 'Woods', 'old', 'favourite', '1980.This', 'picture', 'lot', 'nostalgic', 'appeal', 'remember', 'was', 'quite', 'lot', 'press', 'was', 'being', 'filmed', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'Disney', 'studio', 'seemed', 'be', 'attempting', 'do', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'adult', 'nature', 'compared', 'usual', 'output', 'Unfortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'succeed', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'worth', 'watching.It', 'marvellously', 'atmospheric', 'spooky', '-great', 'cinematography', 'fantastic', 'eerie', 'locations', 'good', 'scary', 'music', 'problem', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'are', 'let-down', 'build-up', 'be', 'frank', 'ending', 'simply', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Let', 'tell', 'magnetic', 'pull', 'eclipse', 'absolutely', 'meaningless', 'nonsense', 'phrase', 'crazy', 'fact', 'finale', 'was', 'always', 'problem', 'film.Upon', 'initial', 'release', 'critics', 'took', 'note', 'bizarre', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'immediately', 'pulled', 'retooling', 'additional', 'shooting', 'editing', 'film', 'was', 're-released', 'year', 'later', 'was', 'improvement', '-eh', '-the', 'ending', 'was', 'still', 'kind', 'iffy', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'Still', 'can', 'overlook', 'problem', 'enjoyed', 'earlier', 'portions', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'DVD', 'Watcher', 'Woods', 'three', 'different', 'endings', 'frankly', 'none', 'really', 'work', 'best', 'solution', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'edit', 'together', 'portions', 'three', 'new', 'composite', 'conclusion', 'However', 'what', 'down', 'problems', 'script', 'were', 'quite', 'unnecessary', 'opinion', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'screenplay', 'was', 'based', 'mystery', 'perfect', 'sense', 'end', 'novel', '-it', 'pretty', 'cool', 'concept', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'earth', 'writers', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'stayed', 'closer', 'logical', 'way', 'summing', 'up', 'plot', 'goodness', 'sake.The', 'acting', 'talent', 'display', 'picture', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'Kyle', 'Richards', 'sister', 'big', '1970', 'child', 'star', 'Kim', 'Richards', 'who', 'worked', 'number', 'well-remembered', 'films', 'television', 'series', 'cute', 'button', 'kind', 'annoying', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'sound', 'too', 'mean-spirited', 'Lynn-Holly', 'Johnson', 'unfortunately', 'acting', 'talent', 'whatsoever', 'opinion', 'scene', 'last', 'two-thirds', 'picture', 'full-blown-hysteria', 'mode', 'more', 'little', 'grating', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'was', 'considered', 'role', 'either', 'turned', 'down', 'was', 'unavailable', 'time', 'kind', 'frustrating', 'thinking', 'what', 'actress', 'Lane', 'skill', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'part', 'Benedict', 'Taylor', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'blondly', 'dreamy', 'heh', '1970', 'teen-girl-magazine', 'pin-up', 'fashion.But', 'course', 'real', 'honours', 'here', 'go', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'who', 'others', 'shade', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'film', 'effective', 'few', 'scenes', 'Just', 'look', 'last', 'scene', 'one', 'look', 'three', 'simple', 'words', 'last', 'words', 'spoken', 'film', 'just', 'what', 'great', 'actress', 'capable', '-I', 'found', 'moment', 'very', 'moving', 'critic', 'time', 'spoke', 'how', 'made', 'bricks', 'straw', 'meaning', 'course', 'rose', 'far', 'material', 'was', 'given', 'was', 'last', 'theatrical', 'feature', 'made', 'had', 'stroke', 'so', 'drastically', 'altered', 'speaking', 'voice', 'appearance.So', 'film', 'problems', 'recommend', 'nonetheless', 'good', 'spooky', 'film', 'younger', 'people', 'Heck', 'watching', 'night', 'alone', 'dark', 'room', 'are', 'still', 'moments', 'make', 'jump', 'Reading', 'comments', 'film', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Database', 'was', 'fun', 'comment', 'hear', 'film', 'scared', '****', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Several', 'people', 'fact', 'said', 'day', 'will', 'not', 'sleep', 'room', 'containing', 'mirror', 'film', 'scared', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'were', 'young.When', 'looking', 'film', 'definitely', 'go', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'DVD', 'release', 'supplemental', 'material', 'missing', 'Disney', 'release', 'including', 'commentary', 'track', 'director']",N/A
453762,A2UO0MN92AQ4L3,6305183260,Old Timer Too,"[3, 4]","If you've looked at my reviews, you know that I have an affection for Rod Serling. Most of my favorite films are Twilight Zone types of stories and this one is no exception.Disney has fluctuated between outstanding animated features and some very good live-action films. At one point, the studio lost some of its direction (after Walt died, by the way), and the animation became less than perfect, the live-action films strayed from being family classics (in the sense of Swiss Family Robinson, Old Yeller, etc.) and called up a darker side of the studio. This story, along with Black Hole, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and Child of Glass, is of that era, or should I say, flavor. All four films are not your standard Disney fare. Of them, only Child of Glass remains in the vault, possibly because it was made for television, rather than for the theater. It is well worth looking for and hopefully the studio will release it some day in the future.Back to the present. This one is due for rerelease in August, 2004. I have it on DVD and as a one-time video store employee, I would recommend it for someone who wanted to see something different in the way of suspense and horror. And, like the good suspense film it is, it does not resort to violence, but a collection of oddities which seem more surreal and strange than supernatural.Ironically, the original release (and the Anchor Bay DVD has all the alternate endings and other goodies - I can't speak to the new release) has one of the strangest twists at the end that one can imagine. Thank you Disney for doing it this way, instead one of the alternatives, for it truly remains the best approach, even if the FX needed to pull off the other approaches had been available and perfected. This is the best and it turns out to be something different!Science Fiction.Huh?Yes. The ending is purely science fiction in nature and scope. Something that you wouldn't expect given the gothic setting of the story and yet, that is exactly what it is. I won't reveal how, but not one customer came back and disagreed with me after watching the film.A note on my rating. Normally, I would have given this five stars, but after watching this a couple of times, I found Holly's voice to wear thin and grate on my nerves. As the story progresses, her voice correctly shows the tension that she is developing as the mystery deepens. It reaches a shrillness that is seldome used as she approaches her own breaking point. Unfortunately, the increasing shrillness works only with the alternate endings. With repeated watchings (it isn't noticeable in the first watching) it fails to work well with the selected ending, even though the ending was the best choice as I mentioned earlier. It is unfortunate that the studio didn't go back and remix her voice to correct the problem, but they were running out of time once the producers realized they couldn't pull off the original ending. As I mentioned, you probably won't notice the problem on your first, or even second watching, but it is there.One final word. Even on the third and forth watchings, I still tended to jump out of surprise... and that's something that's a rarity.",4,Another Twilight Zone Story from Disney,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,3169,"[""'ve"", 'looked', 'reviews', 'know', 'have', 'affection', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Most', 'favorite', 'films', 'are', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'types', 'stories', 'one', 'exception.Disney', 'fluctuated', 'outstanding', 'animated', 'features', 'very', 'good', 'live-action', 'films', 'one', 'point', 'studio', 'lost', 'direction', 'Walt', 'died', 'way', 'animation', 'became', 'less', 'perfect', 'live-action', 'films', 'strayed', 'being', 'family', 'classics', 'sense', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'etc', 'called', 'up', 'darker', 'side', 'studio', 'story', 'Black', 'Hole', 'Something', 'Wicked', 'Way', 'Comes', 'Child', 'Glass', 'era', 'should', 'say', 'flavor', 'four', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'standard', 'Disney', 'fare', 'only', 'Child', 'Glass', 'vault', 'possibly', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'rather', 'theater', 'well', 'worth', 'looking', 'hopefully', 'studio', 'will', 'release', 'day', 'future.Back', 'present', 'one', 'due', 'rerelease', 'August', '2004', 'have', 'DVD', 'one-time', 'video', 'store', 'employee', 'would', 'recommend', 'someone', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'something', 'different', 'way', 'suspense', 'horror', 'good', 'suspense', 'film', 'not', 'resort', 'violence', 'collection', 'oddities', 'seem', 'more', 'surreal', 'strange', 'supernatural.Ironically', 'original', 'release', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'DVD', 'alternate', 'endings', 'other', 'goodies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'new', 'release', 'one', 'strangest', 'twists', 'end', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'Thank', 'Disney', 'doing', 'way', 'instead', 'one', 'alternatives', 'truly', 'best', 'approach', 'even', 'FX', 'needed', 'pull', 'off', 'other', 'approaches', 'had', 'been', 'available', 'perfected', 'best', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'different', 'Science', 'Fiction.Huh', 'Yes', 'ending', 'purely', 'science', 'fiction', 'nature', 'scope', 'Something', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'given', 'gothic', 'setting', 'story', 'yet', 'exactly', 'what', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'how', 'not', 'one', 'customer', 'came', 'back', 'disagreed', 'watching', 'film.A', 'note', 'rating', 'Normally', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'watching', 'couple', 'times', 'found', 'Holly', 'voice', 'wear', 'thin', 'grate', 'nerves', 'story', 'voice', 'correctly', 'tension', 'developing', 'mystery', 'shrillness', 'seldome', 'used', 'own', 'breaking', 'point', 'Unfortunately', 'increasing', 'shrillness', 'only', 'alternate', 'endings', 'repeated', 'watchings', ""n't"", 'noticeable', 'first', 'watching', 'work', 'well', 'selected', 'ending', 'even', 'ending', 'was', 'best', 'choice', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'unfortunate', 'studio', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'remix', 'voice', 'correct', 'problem', 'were', 'running', 'out', 'time', 'producers', 'realized', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'original', 'ending', 'mentioned', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'problem', 'first', 'even', 'second', 'watching', 'there.One', 'final', 'word', 'Even', 'third', 'forth', 'watchings', 'still', 'tended', 'jump', 'surprise', 'something', 'rarity']",N/A

The acting by most of the older actors is good. But the performances of the main child stars stink rather badly.

That the film is a compromise is probably as much due to the climate of the times as it is to their reluctance to be too intense and frightening. A good supporting cast is unfortunately subjugated to the pretty but unimpressive Lynn Holly Johnson, whose performance doesn't quite convey the desperation or depth that might have made the film more compelling. Bette Davis seems curiously restrained. The film might be a good companion piece to ""Burnt Offerings"" another Davis film in which a family comes across a mansion that's ""too good to be true"" for a summer rental. ""Watcher"" is infamous for its aborted first release, in which the film's finale was hastliy assembled. After negative reviews and some tampering, it was released again, but the damage had been done. This DVD version includes all three (!) endings to the movie, and this may be its biggest value for fans. The print is clean and the image sharp. I am guessing by all the positive reviews posted here that ""Watcher in the Woods"" was a sleepover favorite for young girls, and it still might serve that function, in that it's a spooky movie without much to offend younger viewers.

They produced a number of disjointed, unsatisfying films: &quot;Tron;&quot; &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes;&quot; &quot;Tex;&quot; &quot;The Black Hole;&quot; and &quot;Watcher,&quot; among them. They were really trying to find their way and eventually hit paydirt with &quot;Splash.&quot; Alas, &quot;Watcher&quot; is much ado about nothing.

Basically, it's a hoary old plot about &quot;something in the woods&quot; that, uh, &quot;watches.&quot; Oh, and it also likes to follow you around while you're biking.  Is it a ghost? A monster? Answering that question would give away the ending, which (according to lore) was reshot twice. This is definitely After School special stuff--replete with zooms, horrid acting by &quot;typical&quot; kid stars, cheesy special effects, and flacid attempts at shock (a screeching cat, snarling dog, little girls talking in someone else's voice, yada-yada).

Just what does this loving family have in store for them this summer?One of Disney's first non-G-rated productions is rather enjoyable, if not rather hokey.

This was back when you could make a ""family"" horror film and have it work.  Watcher deals with a family moving into a nice new home near the woods.  Bette Davis, the previous owner of the house, still lives on the grounds and becomes interested in the older daughter, Jan, who reminds her of her daughter who had disappeared under bizarre circumstances in the woods many years ago.  Jan starts to notice bizarre goings on with the woods like flashing lights, eerie messages from her younger sister, and images of a blindfolded girl who seems to be begging for help.  This starts Jan on an investigation to find out what happened to this girl and how to help her, whether she's alive or dead.  This movie was quite good, and with alot of the plot points I can't help but think that recent movies like The Ring, Stir of Echoes, or any of the other billion movies that deal with a ghostly child, have in some part been influenced by this movie.  This manages a great sense of spookiness throughout with practically zero violence or death.  You're not gonna be lying trembling under a blanket with fear crying for mommy or anything, but to create spookiness with what is practically G-rated material is impressive.  Then in the last five minutes or so of the film, there's a big zinger thrown at you that shifts the entire plot.  This twist, which jumps right into sci-fi almost, may seem a bit corny, but you gotta admit it's original.  This forgotten classic from the Wonderful World of Disney is well worth checking out.  It's a helluva lot better than a That's So Raven marathon, that's for sure.",4,Ooooooooooooooooooooooh...........Scary!,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,1766,"['Back', 'good', 'ol', 'days', 'Disney', 'putrid', 'sludge', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'Hannah', 'Frickin', 'Montana', 'got', 'cool', 'little', 'movies', 'Watcher', 'Woods', 'was', 'back', 'when', 'could', 'make', 'family', 'horror', 'film', 'have', 'work', 'Watcher', 'deals', 'family', 'moving', 'nice', 'new', 'home', 'woods', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'previous', 'owner', 'house', 'still', 'grounds', 'becomes', 'interested', 'older', 'daughter', 'Jan', 'who', 'daughter', 'who', 'had', 'disappeared', 'bizarre', 'circumstances', 'woods', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Jan', 'notice', 'bizarre', 'goings', 'woods', 'flashing', 'lights', 'eerie', 'messages', 'younger', 'sister', 'images', 'blindfolded', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'begging', 'help', 'Jan', 'investigation', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'girl', 'how', 'help', 'alive', 'dead', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'alot', 'plot', 'points', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'recent', 'movies', 'Ring', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'other', 'billion', 'movies', 'deal', 'ghostly', 'child', 'have', 'part', 'been', 'influenced', 'movie', 'great', 'sense', 'spookiness', 'practically', 'zero', 'violence', 'death', ""'re"", 'not', 'gon', 'be', 'lying', 'trembling', 'blanket', 'fear', 'crying', 'mommy', 'anything', 'create', 'spookiness', 'what', 'practically', 'G-rated', 'material', 'impressive', 'Then', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'big', 'zinger', 'thrown', 'shifts', 'entire', 'plot', 'twist', 'right', 'sci-fi', 'almost', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'corny', 'got', 'ta', 'original', 'forgotten', 'classic', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'helluva', 'lot', 'better', 'So', 'Raven', 'marathon', 'sure']",N/A

There are some fairly chilling sequences and a few scenes that may make the viewer jump but it is pretty much family friendly fare for older kids and grown ups.

The ending in particular earned a lot of criticisms, so producers stuck the movie on a shelf and went about reshooting a few alternative conclusions. Regardless of these changes, audiences and critics did not embrace the movie and it died a quick box-office death. It wasn't until several years later - when the film hit home video - that more fans began to crop up, most of them citing fond childhood memories of a creepy flick. The controversy surrounding the film's difficult birth only added fuel to the fanbase fire, which is just one of the reasons that this Anchor Bay DVD is a long overdue sight for the hardcore fans. The plot is a family-friendly pastiche of nighttime creaks, forest-bound shivers, past-life problems, and ghostly messages. Hollywood legend Bette Davis plays Mrs. Aylwood, a kindly-yet-creepy old lady who rents her massive estate to a friendly American family. The Watcher in the Woods is an intermittently creepy and quite well photographed piece of ""gothic lite"", but newcomers to this movie may struggle through the movie's numerous slow spots and ponderous pacing. The screenplay (based on the novel by Florence Engel Randall) sets up a few provocative ideas, but they're rarely followed up in satisfying style. Most of the acting performances are essentially wooden, with Ms. Davis turning in a glorified cameo that doesn't leave much of an impression. On the whole, The Watcher in the Woods isn't a really bad movie; it's just a bit too safe and more than a little drab. Fans of old-fashioned, atmospheric ghost tales will undoubtedly forgive the film's obvious faults more than others might, but even they will have a hard time generating much enthusiasm for the movie. To call this ""the scariest movie ever made"" is a flat out lie. I mean you're more likely to laugh at it that get scared in it. I really wanted this to be scary, but I was very dissappointed. Haven't been this dissappointed since When A Stranger Calls. See it if you want, but don't expect anything like The Exorcist or The Shining. Watch it alone in the dark.
