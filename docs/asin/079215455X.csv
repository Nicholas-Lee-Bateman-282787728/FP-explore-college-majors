128610,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,079215455X,Acute Observer,"[1, 7]","Days of Heaven, 1978 filmThe story begins in a factory where men shovel coal into furnaces and white hot steel is produced. This is set around 1900. People ride on the top of freight trains. [Some are hatless.] Men are hired as they detrain. Wagons take them to rural a location. We see buffalo in the fields. Wheat fields await harvesting. There are religious services prior to the wheat harvest with horse-drawn reapers. [Did women work in the fields like that?] A remark causes a fight between two young men. Sheaves are stacked to dry. Steam threshers separate wheat grain from chaff. The workers are paid. [Would a big house stand alone without fences or outbuildings?] A man dances on wooden boards. At night there is music and dancing. [The story moves slowly.] The workers climb a freight train to move to a new location.People talk about things. A couple are married outdoors. [No church buildings?] There are more scenes of people outdoors. [Believable?] The actors perform the roles that are written for them. A newspaper reports that President Wilson visited the Texan Panhandle. Men go shooting game birds. Later two WW I era airplanes fly overhead. There is a dancing act, then a B&W; silent film. [I feel sorry for those actors.] Those two airplanes fly away. Winter brings a light snow. A time-lapse shows growing plants. Bee hives sit out on the prairie. The new wheat crop awaits harvest. Is that a wind-driven generator for electricity on the roof? A red flag goes up to warn of a local locust invasion! Men wave cloths to drive them away, then gather them by hand at night to toss them into a bonfire. One man sets the fields afire! [That&#8217;s like burning down the barn to get rid of the rats.]A man takes his pistol and ties up a woman to the porch. He confronts a man, then is stabbed in the chest! [That pistol was unused.] Other men use a picture to track him to a wooded area. Police on horseback ride after him. Shots are fired, a man falls in a stream. The body is taken ashore. Life goes on. Young men in Army uniforms get on a train. Then it ends.This has to be the most boring, senseless movie that I watched. A good movie needs (1) a good story, and (2) a good director to control the action. This has neither. You are free to disagree. It has some interesting scenes about migrant workers on a wheat ranch, but that does not justify this movie. Think of the missed opportunities to portray life around 1916, before America entered &#8220;The War to End War&#8221;. There was a lot going on in that era, little of which is in the school books.",1,A View of Rural Life,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,2578,"['Days', 'Heaven', '1978', 'filmThe', 'story', 'factory', 'where', 'men', 'shovel', 'coal', 'furnaces', 'white', 'hot', 'steel', 'produced', 'set', '1900', 'People', 'ride', 'top', 'freight', 'trains', '[', 'are', 'hatless', ']', 'Men', 'are', 'hired', 'detrain', 'Wagons', 'take', 'rural', 'location', 'see', 'buffalo', 'fields', 'Wheat', 'fields', 'await', 'harvesting', 'are', 'religious', 'services', 'prior', 'wheat', 'harvest', 'horse-drawn', 'reapers', '[', 'Did', 'women', 'work', 'fields', ']', 'A', 'remark', 'fight', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Sheaves', 'are', 'stacked', 'dry', 'Steam', 'threshers', 'separate', 'wheat', 'grain', 'chaff', 'workers', 'are', 'paid', '[', 'Would', 'big', 'house', 'stand', 'alone', 'fences', 'outbuildings', ']', 'man', 'wooden', 'boards', 'night', 'music', 'dancing', '[', 'story', 'slowly', ']', 'workers', 'climb', 'freight', 'train', 'move', 'new', 'location.People', 'talk', 'things', 'couple', 'are', 'married', 'outdoors', '[', 'church', 'buildings', ']', 'are', 'more', 'scenes', 'people', 'outdoors', 'Believable', ']', 'actors', 'perform', 'roles', 'are', 'written', 'newspaper', 'President', 'Wilson', 'visited', 'Texan', 'Panhandle', 'Men', 'go', 'shooting', 'game', 'birds', 'Later', 'two', 'WW', 'era', 'airplanes', 'fly', 'overhead', 'dancing', 'act', 'then', 'B', 'W', 'silent', 'film', '[', 'feel', 'sorry', 'actors', ']', 'two', 'airplanes', 'fly', 'away', 'Winter', 'light', 'snow', 'time-lapse', 'growing', 'plants', 'Bee', 'sit', 'out', 'prairie', 'new', 'wheat', 'crop', 'harvest', 'wind-driven', 'generator', 'electricity', 'roof', 'red', 'flag', 'up', 'warn', 'local', 'locust', 'invasion', 'Men', 'wave', 'cloths', 'drive', 'away', 'then', 'gather', 'hand', 'night', 'toss', 'bonfire', 'One', 'man', 'fields', 'afire', '[', '8217', 'burning', 'down', 'barn', 'get', 'rid', 'rats', ']', 'man', 'pistol', 'up', 'woman', 'porch', 'man', 'then', 'stabbed', 'chest', '[', 'pistol', 'was', 'unused', ']', 'Other', 'men', 'use', 'picture', 'track', 'wooded', 'area', 'Police', 'horseback', 'ride', 'Shots', 'are', 'fired', 'man', 'stream', 'body', 'taken', 'ashore', 'Life', 'Young', 'men', 'Army', 'uniforms', 'get', 'train', 'Then', 'be', 'most', 'boring', 'senseless', 'movie', 'watched', 'good', 'movie', 'needs', '1', 'good', 'story', '2', 'good', 'director', 'control', 'action', 'neither', 'are', 'free', 'disagree', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'migrant', 'workers', 'wheat', 'ranch', 'not', 'justify', 'movie', 'Think', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'portray', 'life', '1916', 'America', 'entered', '8220', 'War', 'End', 'War', '8221', 'was', 'lot', 'going', 'era', 'little', 'school', 'books']",N/A

""Days Of Heaven"" is a drama set in the early years of the 20th century, starring are a very young Richard Gere, Brooke Adams, Sam Shepard & Linda Manz. The movie was carefully directed by Terrence Malick. The most heralded part of this movie is the cinematography, which presents wide fields, farms and landscapes, besides a good costume work and good music.The plot of this movie becomes more and more interesting gradually. The movie basically is a tale about the greed and ambition of the human being and all the tricks and misdemeanors that the people can do in order to get money and properties. Also in the game appear feelings like love and hate, and the envy.

128612,A1MNRQCTURUNLF,079215455X,"""alenchik""","[3, 7]","The photography in this film is truly remarkable. Rich, vivid, bold and immensely beautiful. It is the movie's main attraction, and it almost takes on a role of a protagonist. Especially since there is so little else in the film to comprise any substance. Conceived as a sweeping epic, it plays like a TV-movie, and, ultimately, leaves one feeling unsated. Centered around a watered-down semi-love semi-triangle, the storyline develops at an uneven pace with one fragmentary scene succeeding another. Characters wander about, evidently propelled by something substantial and meaningful, but the significance never really surfaces or even comes up for air. The film progresses in gasps and winds up at an ending that had been foreshadowed long before. Richard Gere's and Sam Shepard's youthful looks are delightful (handsome people are enjoyable to watch, after all), while Brooke Adams is rather bleak for the role and the weight it carries. Linda Manz as the little sister is very interesting. Overall, I don't feel that the film offers anything fresh, novel, or even mildly exciting other than its visuals. Unlike nature itself, which is often captured here in close-up and/or wide angle, the human characters seem approached with a long lens. There's evidence of something brooding and bubbling under their surfaces but it never moves beyond vague and generalized. To reiterate, however, in terms of photography itself, there're only a handful of other movies out there that are this stunning.",3,Mixed reactions,1041120000,"12 29, 2002",2002,1496,"['photography', 'film', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'Rich', 'vivid', 'bold', 'immensely', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'main', 'attraction', 'almost', 'role', 'protagonist', 'Especially', 'so', 'little', 'else', 'film', 'comprise', 'substance', 'Conceived', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'TV-movie', 'ultimately', 'one', 'feeling', 'unsated', 'Centered', 'watered-down', 'semi-love', 'semi-triangle', 'storyline', 'uneven', 'pace', 'one', 'fragmentary', 'scene', 'succeeding', 'Characters', 'wander', 'evidently', 'propelled', 'something', 'substantial', 'meaningful', 'significance', 'never', 'really', 'even', 'up', 'air', 'film', 'gasps', 'up', 'ending', 'had', 'been', 'foreshadowed', 'long', 'before', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'youthful', 'looks', 'are', 'delightful', 'handsome', 'people', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'rather', 'bleak', 'role', 'weight', 'Linda', 'Manz', 'little', 'sister', 'very', 'interesting', 'Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'offers', 'anything', 'fresh', 'novel', 'even', 'mildly', 'exciting', 'other', 'visuals', 'nature', 'often', 'captured', 'here', 'close-up', 'and/or', 'wide', 'angle', 'human', 'characters', 'seem', 'approached', 'long', 'lens', 'evidence', 'something', 'brooding', 'bubbling', 'surfaces', 'never', 'vague', 'generalized', 'reiterate', 'however', 'terms', 'photography', ""'re"", 'only', 'handful', 'other', 'movies', 'there', 'are', 'stunning']",N/A

And if any film could benefit from or deserves to receive the full criterion makeover it is this one. As probably the most visually evocative picture ever in terms of cinematography, the new print makes the beauty here even more enjoyable. The sound was sort of muddled in the original release making it very difficult to understand the voice over clearly and is greatly improved here. It is now much easier to understand everything Linda Manz says, even without resorting to the new subtitles, which were strangely absent from the original DVD release.

128615,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,079215455X,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","If any film proves the fact that familiarities don't have to feel like clich&eacute;s, it is Terrence Malick's `Days of Heaven'.The basic plot behind this film is brief and familiar.  It's nothing more than a love story (or love triangle) set in Texas during the turn of the century.  Bill, who suffers from a hot temper, accidentally kills a man and has to flee for his life.  He takes along his lover and his sister and begins working in the Texas wheat fields.  Posing as siblings, they decide to con a sickly farmer out of his fortunes, but things get rather complicated when Abby, Bill's girlfriend (who happens to marry the farmer in order to get ties to his money), falls in love with the farmer.Like I said, there is nothing remotely special about the plot, but this film proves that the WAY you tell a story can totally elevate the story itself.I am not a follower of Terrence Malick.  In fact, I have only seen two of his films.  The other film I've seen is `The New World', and I have mixed feelings about it.  While watching `Days of Heaven' I can see similarities in the storytelling (the camera work and tonal shifts) and so I'm urged by inward desires to watch `The New World' again and reevaluate my initial feelings.  Malick has a distinct style, and it oozes all over his work.  His directorial influences, deciding to drastically cut down dialog and allow the visuals to speak for themselves, add layers of depth and creativity to the film.  I was reminded of P.T. Anderson's modern masterpiece `There Will Be Blood' while watching this film, for they both share a similar love of cinematographic storytelling.For a film that could have dwelled within clich&eacute;s, Malick creates something that is fresh, new and definitive.What is so great about the way this film is made is that it excites our senses with the vivid imagery, allowing us to focus on the internal instead of the external.  By muting conversations and allowing gazes to burn, we sink into the character's emotional conversations, not their verbal ones.  This challenges us to contemplate what they are thinking and thus brings us to another place entirely, where instinct takes over and rationality disappears.The acting is spot on here (one of the only times I'll ever say that about Richard Gere).  Gere has a solemn quality that just doesn't work for me most of the time.  In fact, it shocks me that his finest performance is also his worst (his acting in `Chicago' is brilliant, but his singing is dreadful).  Here though, Gere uses his melodramatic qualities to find the inner yearning within Bill's soul.  He wants a good life, he just doesn't know how to achieve it.  Sam Shepard is broken and bewildered and it reads so magically on screen.  You want o root for him.  Linda Manz (who sounds so much like a boy on narration) floats from scene to scene thanks to some dynamic editing.  The standout is, without question, Brooke Adams.  Her performance is just brilliant.  She envelopes all of our senses in this woman's plight against her own spirit.  It's stunning to watch.But, the star of the show is Malick.  His skill behind the camera is astonishing.  You will find yourself captivated by every frame (this film rightfully won that cinematography Oscar) and just in awe of all that you are feeling.  Malick's creation stirs up many emotions.I just wish more filmmakers strived to make something unique out of something familiar.",5,Heavenly...,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,3428,"['film', 'fact', 'familiarities', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'Days', ""Heaven'.The"", 'basic', 'plot', 'film', 'brief', 'familiar', 'nothing', 'more', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'triangle', 'set', 'Texas', 'turn', 'century', 'Bill', 'who', 'hot', 'temper', 'accidentally', 'man', 'flee', 'life', 'lover', 'sister', 'working', 'Texas', 'wheat', 'fields', 'Posing', 'siblings', 'decide', 'con', 'sickly', 'farmer', 'fortunes', 'things', 'get', 'rather', 'complicated', 'when', 'Abby', 'Bill', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'marry', 'farmer', 'order', 'get', 'ties', 'money', 'love', 'farmer.Like', 'said', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'special', 'plot', 'film', 'WAY', 'tell', 'story', 'can', 'totally', 'elevate', 'story', 'itself.I', 'am', 'not', 'follower', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'fact', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'two', 'films', 'other', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'New', 'World', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'watching', 'Days', 'Heaven', 'can', 'see', 'similarities', 'storytelling', 'camera', 'work', 'tonal', 'shifts', 'so', ""'m"", 'urged', 'inward', 'desires', 'watch', 'New', 'World', 'again', 'reevaluate', 'initial', 'feelings', 'Malick', 'distinct', 'style', 'work', 'directorial', 'influences', 'deciding', 'drastically', 'cut', 'down', 'dialog', 'allow', 'visuals', 'speak', 'layers', 'depth', 'creativity', 'film', 'was', 'reminded', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'modern', 'masterpiece', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'watching', 'film', 'share', 'similar', 'love', 'cinematographic', 'storytelling.For', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'dwelled', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Malick', 'something', 'fresh', 'new', 'definitive.What', 'so', 'great', 'way', 'film', 'made', 'senses', 'vivid', 'imagery', 'allowing', 'focus', 'internal', 'instead', 'external', 'muting', 'conversations', 'allowing', 'gazes', 'burn', 'sink', 'character', 'emotional', 'conversations', 'not', 'verbal', 'ones', 'contemplate', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'thus', 'place', 'entirely', 'where', 'instinct', 'rationality', 'disappears.The', 'acting', 'spot', 'here', 'one', 'only', 'times', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'say', 'about', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Gere', 'solemn', 'quality', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'most', 'time', 'fact', 'finest', 'performance', 'also', 'worst', 'acting', 'Chicago', 'brilliant', 'singing', 'dreadful', 'Here', 'Gere', 'melodramatic', 'qualities', 'find', 'inner', 'yearning', 'Bill', 'soul', 'good', 'life', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'achieve', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'broken', 'bewildered', 'so', 'magically', 'screen', 'want', 'o', 'root', 'Linda', 'Manz', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'boy', 'narration', 'scene', 'scene', 'thanks', 'dynamic', 'editing', 'standout', 'question', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'performance', 'just', 'brilliant', 'senses', 'woman', 'plight', 'own', 'spirit', 'stunning', 'watch.But', 'star', 'show', 'Malick', 'skill', 'camera', 'astonishing', 'will', 'find', 'captivated', 'frame', 'film', 'rightfully', 'won', 'cinematography', 'Oscar', 'just', 'awe', 'are', 'feeling', 'Malick', 'creation', 'stirs', 'up', 'many', 'emotions.I', 'just', 'wish', 'more', 'filmmakers', 'strived', 'make', 'something', 'unique', 'something', 'familiar']",N/A

The underdeveloped portrayal of this story comes across at least as much as a documentary as any thing else.

Richard Gere is a laborer from Chicago; one day he beats up his foreman and decides the only thing to do is hightail it out of there. He heads west with his little sister (played by Linda Manz) and his lover (Brooke Adams). They end up on a wheat ranch at harvest time and go to work there. The wealthy ranch owner (Sam Shepard) falls in love with Adams, (she and Gere have been masquerading as brother and sister in order to stay together and avoid talk).Thus the classic love triangle is established (there are also Biblical overtones to the Abraham and Sarah story in Genesis). Gere and Adams decide that it would be good if she agrees to marry Shepard because rumor has it that Shepard only has about a year to live anyway (she, of course, would inherit his wealth). But Shepard learns the truth about Gere and Adams and a fight to the finish ensues, with Gere getting shot down.The story is told in a series of short sequences, many of them adding up to very little - though with plenty of space for us to decide whatever we want about them. There is very little dialogue, but lots for the eyes to revel in with the beautiful photography of the endless wheat fields. The story is narrated by Manz, who seems wise (and cynical) beyond her years. The movie evokes a feeling, not to be diminished by too much thought. Taken on that level, it's a pretty good movie.

128623,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,079215455X,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[2, 2]","I saw this movie twenty-five years ago, and had enough positive memories that when I saw that Criterion had re-released it I picked it up again.  I'm not a fan of Richard Gere, but director Terrance Malick (The Thin Red Line) and cinematographer N&eacute;stor Almendros (who won an Oscar for his camera work) made such a visually intriguing movie that the actors are only co-equals with the camera lens.  In fact, the love triangle that develops seems like an afterthought - a framing device for Malick's preoccupation with the hordes of migrant workers and the steam threshers attacking the waving sea of wheat.Richard Gere is Bill, who flees Chicago after killing a man.  With him are his lover Abby (Brooke Adams) and sister Linda (Linda Manz).  They hop a train to Texas, where they find work on a mammoth wheat farm.  They learn that the wealthy owner (Sam Shepard) is dying, and Bill urges Abby to get closer to him, as he's already shown an interest in her.  Eventually Abby and the farmer marry, and Bill sits on the sidelines, waiting for him to die.Mr. Malick's storytelling style won't suit everyone - as with 'The Thin Red Line', he leaves gaps for the audience to fill.  Most viewers won't have difficulty with this, but it causes the movie to unfold at a different pace than some may be used to.  And, again as in 'Thin Red Line', he uses voice over narration that often has little to do with the onscreen action.  The ending, though it resolves the conflicts initiated in the film, carries on a bit further, which leaves it with an open-ended feel, but no more than real life.However, the beauty of this film is the scenes of the workers in the fields, and the steam powered machinery, and the startling vistas of wheat and sky.  Mr. Malick's illusion is very effective - I'm persuaded it had to have been much as he presents it.  The rhythm and manner of the migrant workers feel authentic, and even though the work must have been extremely hard and tiring, there is a subtle attraction to the natural pace of it.  Very subtle - I can recognize it but I have no desire to do it.Lastly, though the storyline may slump at times, there is also powerful imagery throughout - enough to balance the flaws and still come out ahead.

This is one of those films that deserves the Criterion blu-ray treatment.  It's why I'm glad to have a blu-ray player.For those unfamiliar with this film or the director (shame on you!), Terrence Malick is a legendary recluse whose films are hailed as masterpieces by critics, but oven have fans divided.  The films typically have breathtaking vistas but very little dialogue.  This film (his 2nd full length directorial role) is that style of film.  The movie plays like a series of collages.  When dialogue is spoken, it is  usually important.  But Malick tells this tale through the pictures not the lines.  We have entire scenes go by without any spoken words.  I think there is probably a part of the film where nobody speaks for nearly 20 minutes.The film is about a family in the early 1900s that is forced to leave Chicago (thanks to a deadly work altercation) and to the Texas panhandle in order to make a living.  The remainder of the film centers around the family and the land owner they work for and the resulting ill-fated love triangle.Though the film was not a success initially, and critics mainly paid compliments only to the visuals (the film also won an Oscar for cinematography), the film later found new life among many film-ophiles.It is not a film for everyone.  Granted, some may find the film slow or even 'boring'.  But for those that look beyond the surface see a richly told tale with weaves the setting into the story.  The scene with the fire is among the greatest scenes I have ever seen in any film.  And there are tons of special features, which honestly, Criterion had seemed to be skimping on lately: there is a 41 page booklet which you should read AFTER the film (it gives away everything) and then on subsequent viewings you might want to listen to the audio commentary (sadly Malick does not offer commentary - or pretty much any publicity - I'm surprised there are even photos of him on the web!).  There are several additional video interviews as well.Though I am not a huge Richard Gere fan, I found his acting well suited to the role.  In fact, just about everyone is this film is superb.

128631,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,079215455X,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[4, 5]","Naturally, in a film like this, the what that happens is not as important as the how it happens. And this makes all the difference, as nothing I could describe to the viewer could resonate as deeply as what is seen. There are numerous camera shots that establish mood (most notably the famed `magic hour' landscapes, and scenes wherein words are not spoken, but glances tell the tale). There are great scenes- such as when locusts swarm the fields, and when a fire breaks out at night as Bill and the Farmer fight. The audio commentary by editor Billy Weber, art director Jack Fisk, costume designer Patricia Norris, and casting director Dianne Crittenden, lends great insight into how these scenes were achieved without special effects, and with some danger. The locusts were really peanuts shells tossed from a helicopter, as the actors walked backward, to give the effect that the shells/locusts were rising upward and the fire scenes were not as well-controlled as thought. Also, there is quite a revelation as to the extent that Malick changed the film in two years of postproduction, cutting much filmed dialogue, and replacing it with the Manz narration. Another bit of trivia ia that John Travolta was the initial choice for the role of Bill, but the ABC television network would not let him out of his contract for the tv series Welcome Back, Kotter.But, there are a few other nice features on The Criterion Collection DVD.  There are interviews with cinematographer Haskell Wexler and cameraman John Bailey, and an interview with Richard Gere, plus a booklet that has an essay on the film by film critic Adrian Martin, which is rather rote observations that many others have made before, and a piece from the autobiography of cinematographer Nestor Almendros that deals with the film. The 95 minute film is shown in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio, and is superb. There is one puzzling oddity in the Criterion release vis-&agrave;-vis an earlier 1999 Paramount Pictures DVD version of the film, and that is the lack of the original theatrical trailer that the Paramount release included.Of course, given the high and truly transcendent quality of the film, it is little wonder that few critics praised it upon its release, and even those who appreciated the film still did not fundamentally get it. As an example of the former claim, I give you the stolid Pauline Kael, of The New Yorker, who wrote that, `the film is an empty Christmas tree: you can hang all your dumb metaphors on it.' Of the latter claim I give you the Chicago Sun-Times' Roger Ebert, who in re-reviewing the film decades later, wrote, `We do not feel the full passion of the adults because it is not her (Linda's) passion: It is seen at a distance, as a phenomenon, like the weather, or the plague of grasshoppers that signals the beginning of the end.' This is an excellent observation that explains why much of the film's `passion' seems to be missing, considering the center of the story seems to be a love triangle, that oldest of motivs. This is because the whole film is Linda's tale, and she was not directly involved. But, just as one feels that Ebert may have gotten a grasp of the film, he shows his readers that his insight was just another case of a hundred darts being tossed blindfoldedly, with one lucky sucker hitting the bull's-eye, for he later writes: `This is a movie made by a man who knew how something felt, and found a way to evoke it in us. That feeling is how a child feels when it lives precariously, and then is delivered into security and joy, and then has it all taken away again- and blinks away the tears and says it doesn't hurt.' Well, no. Period. The reason the film is constructed the way it is is not because it is emotion-based, as Ebert and a plethora of lesser critics claim (despite writing of the claim in a convincing way- the man did win a Pulitzer for his wordsmithing, after all), but because it has a fantastic screenplay, constructed in postproduction, which chooses a very unique narrative form- one based upon inferences and implications (they are different beasts) and told through emotional snippets. It is not because emotion has replaced narrative, but emotion has been tamed to a narrative tool, along with a purely visual anecdoture cribbed from the silent era.In this way, like 2001, Days Of Heaven does not prove that a great film can succeed without any story, but shows the essential need for a great story to make great cinema. Malick simply went beyond the scope of most critics' rudimentary understanding of what a narrative looks like and how it should be conveyed, in emotive threads or in silent fenestration of images. Add to that the revolutionary use of voiceover to act as both tangential relief and ironic commentary, and, even were the acting mediocre (it is not, for it is truly acting when dialogue is superfluous) or the camerawork pedestrian (it is not), the film would be great, anyway. But given the quality of all the other elements, Malick's daring makes this film one for the ages; one which be studied long after the species has left behind the planet earth, and only such images of it remain. Perhaps our descendants will feel for it (and the film that conveys it to them) the way Linda feels for an anomic friend she reacquaints with at film's end, when she opines, in a Huckleberry Finnian way, `This girl, she didn't know where she was goin' or what she was goin' to do. She didn't have no money on her. Maybe she'd meet up with a character. I was hopin' things would work out for her. She was a good friend of mine.'

The camera could move a little bit, but just so, and then the character focuses from the new viewpoint, and then ...In short, Malick's thoroughgoing creative sense borders on the mind-boggling (i.e., ""How could he ACCOUNT for that?"") in the simplest, humblest sense: the scope of his grasp is well beyond what usually even OCCURS to people.  Multiple viewings, doubtless, would be rewarded, but are hardly necessary: you're seeing the action happening from the whole scope of occurrence, no-holds-barred, and it leaves one breath-taken at how much could be, would be, NEEDS to be caught to relay a story ""fairly"" and ""honestly.""

I had that opinion the first time I saw it on VHS and still feel the same way years later after numerous DVD viewings. It's been at the top of my list of favorite movies since I began compiling a list over a decade ago.  The only thing left is to hope it gets a great Blu-Ray treatment.It's very dream-like, surreal, a film I never get tired of watching. If I had to pin it down to two reasons why, it would be the video and the audio.The cinematography alone makes this movie worth watching repeatedly.The same superlatives can be used when discussing the soundtrack, a haunting music score that gets better and better each time one views this film. In fact, lately it's the music more than anything else I miss when I go periods without viewing this film.I find the narration to be unique, an unusual insight into the characters of the film and the thoughts of the little girl (Linda Manz), who does the narrating. The characters that continually fascinate me are Brooke Adams, as the lead female, and Robert J. Wilke, as the farm foreman. I guess it's their faces that intrigue me. Adams' down-turned mouth and sad look and Wilke's wrinklies catch my attention every time.The story is interesting, generally low-key but with a few quick violent scenes that are quite memorable. More than that, one gets an incredible feel for the land and for the migrant workers of that time period. Another nice aspect of this film is the very small amount of profanity. Kids probably would be bored with this film but at least I wouldn't be afraid to show it to them.But as many pluses as the story boasts, that haunting music and those incredible visuals are what drive me back for more.

While the folks at Criterion haven't quite given it their deluxe treatment, they have provided a brand new, Terrence Malick-approved transfer that is a revelation and a few, yet substantial extras.While it was too much to hope for a commentary by the media-shy Malick, Criterion has provided us with the next best thing: a commentary by art director Jack Fisk, editor Billy Weber (both men have worked on all of Malick's films), costume designer Patricia Norris and casting director Dianne Crittenden. Weber talks about Linda Manz's inexperience as an actress and how she kept referring to Richard Gere, Brooke Adams and Sam Shepard by their real names. Fisk talks about the challenges of constructing sets with very little preparation time. They all talk about Malick's working methods and provide fascinating insight into the director's creative process.There is an audio interview with Richard Gere that plays over footage from the film. The actor says that the filmmaker spent a year casting and this drove him crazy and he almost left the film. Gere candidly reveals that Malick didn't really know how to direct actors and this led to some frustration on their part.Also included is a 2002 interview with Sam Shepard who mentions that Malick was shy and almost embarrassed to ask him to be in the film. Shepard also talks about the filmmaker's attention to detail and how in awe he was of nature and his desire to capture it on film.Finally, there are interviews with camera operators John Bailey and Haskell Wexler. Bailey says that Malick made a classic, pastoral film but with an edgy, American New Wave style. He also talks about Malick's creative process and the cameras they used. Wexler took over when the film's cinematographer Nestor Almendros left due to a prior commitment. He talks about Malick's connection to nature and his working methods.",5,Malick finally joins the Criterion Collection!,1192147200,"10 12, 2007",2007,2001,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'unceremoniously', 'Heavenon', 'DVD', 'decent', 'transfer', 'extras', 'save', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'folks', 'Criterion', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'given', 'deluxe', 'treatment', 'have', 'provided', 'brand', 'new', 'Terrence', 'Malick-approved', 'transfer', 'revelation', 'few', 'yet', 'substantial', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'hope', 'commentary', 'media-shy', 'Malick', 'Criterion', 'provided', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'commentary', 'art', 'director', 'Jack', 'Fisk', 'editor', 'Billy', 'Weber', 'men', 'have', 'worked', 'Malick', 'films', 'costume', 'designer', 'Patricia', 'Norris', 'casting', 'director', 'Dianne', 'Crittenden', 'Weber', 'talks', 'Linda', 'Manz', 'inexperience', 'actress', 'how', 'kept', 'referring', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'real', 'names', 'Fisk', 'talks', 'challenges', 'constructing', 'sets', 'very', 'little', 'preparation', 'time', 'talk', 'Malick', 'working', 'methods', 'provide', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'director', 'creative', 'process.There', 'audio', 'interview', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'over', 'footage', 'film', 'actor', 'filmmaker', 'spent', 'year', 'casting', 'drove', 'crazy', 'almost', 'left', 'film', 'Gere', 'candidly', 'Malick', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'direct', 'actors', 'led', 'frustration', 'part.Also', 'included', '2002', 'interview', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'who', 'Malick', 'was', 'shy', 'almost', 'embarrassed', 'ask', 'be', 'film', 'Shepard', 'also', 'filmmaker', 'attention', 'detail', 'how', 'awe', 'was', 'nature', 'desire', 'capture', 'film.Finally', 'are', 'interviews', 'camera', 'operators', 'John', 'Bailey', 'Haskell', 'Wexler', 'Bailey', 'Malick', 'made', 'classic', 'pastoral', 'film', 'edgy', 'American', 'New', 'Wave', 'style', 'also', 'Malick', 'creative', 'process', 'cameras', 'used', 'Wexler', 'took', 'over', 'when', 'film', 'cinematographer', 'Nestor', 'Almendros', 'left', 'due', 'prior', 'commitment', 'Malick', 'connection', 'nature', 'working', 'methods']",N/A

Second film of Terrence Malick, the acclaimed director of THE THIN RED LINE, it relates the encounter of three young farm workers and their  wealthy employer in 1916.The director of photography, Nestor Almendros,  has obtained an Oscar for his work and the least one can say is that he  deserved it. In fact, DAYS OF HEAVEN offers a breathtaking trip in the  heart of America. Terrence Malick films as well the most little animals as  the vast landscapes in order to emphasize the actions of Man on Nature. The  machines brought by the industrial revolution in this idyllic land appear  as monsters.In this - Hell and Paradise - scheme, no wonder that humans  seem doomed to sin. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams don't accept the poor and  working life they're condemned to and, as soon as the occasion comes, will  lie, cheat and kill.The uneasiness we feel during DAYS OF HEAVEN comes  from the strangeness of the commentary of Linda Manz, the 13th year old  girl whose voice will haunt you for a long time. Her innocent vision of the  events she witnesses is one of the reason DAYS OF HEAVEN stays, 20 years  after its theatrical release, as an UFO in Hollywood production.A DVD  for the movie lover.NB: Ennio Morricone gives here one of the best  musical score of his career.",4,PARADISE LOST,924825600,"04 23, 1999",1999,1357,"['DAYS', 'OF', 'HEAVEN', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'american', 'movies', 'last', '25', 'years', 'Second', 'film', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'THE', 'THIN', 'RED', 'LINE', 'encounter', 'three', 'young', 'farm', 'workers', 'wealthy', 'employer', '1916.The', 'director', 'photography', 'Nestor', 'Almendros', 'obtained', 'Oscar', 'work', 'least', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'deserved', 'fact', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'HEAVEN', 'breathtaking', 'trip', 'heart', 'America', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'little', 'animals', 'vast', 'landscapes', 'order', 'emphasize', 'actions', 'Man', 'Nature', 'machines', 'brought', 'industrial', 'revolution', 'idyllic', 'land', 'appear', 'monsters.In', 'Hell', 'Paradise', 'scheme', 'wonder', 'seem', 'doomed', 'sin', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'do', ""n't"", 'accept', 'poor', 'working', 'life', ""'re"", 'condemned', 'as', 'soon', 'occasion', 'will', 'lie', 'cheat', 'kill.The', 'uneasiness', 'feel', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'HEAVEN', 'strangeness', 'commentary', 'Linda', 'Manz', '13th', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'voice', 'will', 'haunt', 'long', 'time', 'innocent', 'vision', 'events', 'one', 'reason', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'HEAVEN', 'stays', '20', 'years', 'theatrical', 'release', 'UFO', 'Hollywood', 'production.A', 'DVD', 'movie', 'lover.NB', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'here', 'one', 'best', 'musical', 'score', 'career']",N/A

The story is being told through the eyes of a little girl, but Richard Gere, Brooke Adams, and Sam Shepard are the stars of the film.  It was directed by Terrence Malick, who has made only a handful of films, but each one is unique and is a gem.  This movie is no exeception either.  It is more or less a love story between two men in love with the same woman.  The movie uses this story as a backdrop for its stunning and memorable images.  Many scenes are likely to stay in the viewers' minds for a long time.What is lacking in the movie, though, is a strong screenplay and complete character development.  Many scenes leave left me empty simply because there was not enough dialog, and the characters seemed passive.  Maybe the movie was supposed to be that way, but those two aspects are its main flaws.

128647,A1LTKJ9UTZ9NVI,079215455X,Filmaholics Anyonymous,"[2, 2]","Cosmic, ethereal, maddening, and sublime, Days Of Heaven is extraordinary. The film is a deliberately haunting poem, and the epic scope of the picture makes experiencing it an unreal exercise. What I love most is a film that challenges me. The films of Terrence Malick do just that. Days Of Heaven is a bizarre Hollywood time-piece with an Avante Garde fluidity. Lyrical storytelling is habitual of Malick and his work, but Days Of Heaven is not just lyrical, it is astounding in its complexities, and unbelievably bold in its philosophical austerity.The philosophical ideas the film meditates on are numerous, but it is impossible to pin even a single one of those deeply stirring ideas down. Sure, in the subtext traces of the natural order of things, and man's place in it, transient and makeshift, or seasonal, in existence, and so forth can be found. The film communicates so much to its audience, but any attempt to try and pass the 'message' along is a foolhardy task, as the film is so abundant with meditations on life, and far too beautiful to hold under the crude magnifying glass of self-referential analysis. The film is too special for all of that. Each and every single viewer will take away something different and wholly unique. Days Of Heaven has the ability to mean many different things to many different people, and I must say that the film holds untold fortunes for the readily open and available viewer. Days Of Heaven is why I love films. The films of Terrence Malick represent everything I've always wanted films to be, but never thought even remotely possible. 'Cosmic' is the word I'm searching for.So far as I'm concerned, the single most important player in Malick's ongoing circus has always been his longtime editor, Billy Weber. Weber is a genius film editor and without his contributions I am convinced Days Of Heaven would not be half the film it is. Weber assembles Malick's philosophically ambiguous and broad vision into something coherent, fluid, and structurally sound, all the while retaining the grandeur and scope of his artistic intentions. It is as if Weber establishes a narrative for the subtext, a home for the details. With Weber's assistance, Days Of Heaven is not only a beautiful film, it is a beautifully imagined one, expertly assembled by the best scissors in the business.Viewer beware! Watching the film may cause an adverse effect as the viewer gains a new found respect for its leading man, Richard Gere. Gere has well earned some scrutiny in his career, but bite your tongue until you see his work in Days Of Heaven, which is easily his finest hour. Actors play a strange role in Malick's films. I wouldn't go so far as to call them props, but they aren't the featured elements of his films. Rather the actors make up but a small part of what his films eventually become. No one single element of Days Of Heaven is more significant than the other, everything comes together to create the perfect film. The film is not star-centic, nor are any of Malick's films.Although I do believe that the actual story of Days Of Heaven is told in the subtext, the base premise is unbelievably well conceived and watching it develop is truly a gift.In closing, I am in love with Days Of Heaven. Head over heels crazy about it.

128648,A73DFWJE0CGY6,079215455X,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[11, 11]","I will go out on a limb here and declare this movie the most heartbreakingly beautiful film I ever saw. I went to see it when it came out, and it continued to haunt me until I obtained my first VCR, whereupon it was one of the first movies I purchased. The story is told pretty much visually, and it is such an old story that the viewer doesn't need any more dialog than there is. One reviewer addressed the issue of Linda Manz's New York accent when the trio of protagonists is supposed to be from Chicago; but after multiple viewings, it became clear to me that these guys have been nomads since day one, so it's quite plausible to me that they, in fact, did come from New York originally (Richard Gere also has a decided Noo Yawk sound) and in the way of migrant workers, had only recently called Chicago home. The opening of the movie - old turn-of-the-century stills - is rife with the melting-pot faces that, mostly, started out in New York and went where the work was.When I need an example of absolute perfection - my opinion - in cinematography, this is the film I would always choose. So many isolated shots come to mind - a wine glass sitting on a riverbed underwater with a fish swimming by; five guys, conversing quietly in another language as they walk, bundled against winter; the panic of animals in a brushfire, a burning tractor coming out of a fire at night like a machine from hell - as well as spooky, ghostly sights of people around a campfire at night on a rivershore; faces that you would not normally consider beautiful taking on a luminous quality because of the talent of the filming. The story almost takes a back seat to the filmwork, although it is nearly a Greek tragedy; Bill, Linda, and Abby, migrant workers scraping to survive and stay together (Bill and Linda are sister and brother; Abby is Bill's lover) escape a situation in Chicago (Bill has inadvertently killed a bullheaded boss) by jumping a train loaded down with immigrants and ride to the wheatfields of the Texas Panhandle, where they become just three more harvesters until the owner, played with a sweet vulnerability by Sam Shepard, catches sight of Abby in the field and falls in love with her. Bill sees this in his unfocused mind as a way for his little group to advance, after he overhears a conversation between Shepard and a doctor which suggests that the young landowner is dying. Bill persuades Abby to accept the owner's offer of marriage - which, to her credit, she seems initially reluctant to do - reasoning that she can make the guy happy for the little time he has left and then the fortune he has will be all theirs. His plan hits a snag over three things; a suspicious foreman, who loves the landowner like a son and distrusts the trio of migrants right now; the landowner seems to hit his second wind after marrying Abby; and, the biggest bad thing, Abby falls in love with her new husband. Left out frustrated in the cold, suffering unending animosity from the foreman, Bill does the only intelligent thing he can think of and leaves, only to return some time later. From there things go very badly.This movie gives a real flavour of what the early 1900s must have been like - the serendipity of a travelling circus, apparently out of gas, who land on the owner's property and give performances in exchange for room and board (and probably gas)- these things happened then, impromptu little entertainments that seemed to have little relevance to the surroundings but which were eagerly looked for - diversions were few and far between, folks - and at one point, the newformed family group runs to meet and wave at Woodrow Wilson's passing train. The ordinary people doing the harvesting, though only touched on, are clear and real; you've seen these people in town, working, playing, fighting. And the pathos of the underclass comes out in something Linda Manz's character says halfway through in a voiceover: ""You're only here once, and you should have it nice.""This movie is tragic and beautiful, with good performances, especially from Linda Manz as the hapless younger sister who is at the mercy of circumstances she is powerless to control, and who learns the cruel lesson so many like her had to learn in those days; how to survive on your own. Ms. Manz pretty much disappeared from film after that and returned to private life. Too bad - she was a breath of fresh air in a lot of ways. In fact, the only people who really advanced filmwise after this were Richard Gere and Sam Shepard - although Gere isn't as good yet as he could be (again, my opinion) and Sam Shepard is underused or too preoccupied with his writing. I highly recommend this movie to cinematography aficianados and to anyone who likes a good period piece told with great sensitivity and minimal dialog.",5,luminousity on film,1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,4796,"['will', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'here', 'declare', 'movie', 'most', 'heartbreakingly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'went', 'see', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'continued', 'haunt', 'obtained', 'first', 'VCR', 'whereupon', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'purchased', 'story', 'told', 'pretty', 'much', 'visually', 'such', 'old', 'story', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'need', 'more', 'dialog', 'One', 'reviewer', 'addressed', 'issue', 'Linda', 'Manz', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'when', 'trio', 'protagonists', 'supposed', 'be', 'Chicago', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'became', 'clear', 'guys', 'have', 'been', 'nomads', 'day', 'one', 'quite', 'plausible', 'fact', 'did', 'come', 'New', 'York', 'originally', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'also', 'decided', 'Noo', 'Yawk', 'sound', 'way', 'migrant', 'workers', 'had', 'only', 'recently', 'called', 'Chicago', 'home', 'opening', 'movie', 'old', 'turn-of-the-century', 'stills', 'rife', 'melting-pot', 'mostly', 'started', 'out', 'New', 'York', 'went', 'where', 'work', 'was.When', 'need', 'example', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'opinion', 'cinematography', 'film', 'would', 'always', 'choose', 'So', 'many', 'isolated', 'shots', 'come', 'mind', 'wine', 'glass', 'sitting', 'riverbed', 'underwater', 'fish', 'swimming', 'five', 'guys', 'conversing', 'quietly', 'language', 'walk', 'bundled', 'winter', 'panic', 'animals', 'brushfire', 'burning', 'tractor', 'coming', 'fire', 'night', 'machine', 'hell', 'as', 'well', 'spooky', 'ghostly', 'sights', 'people', 'campfire', 'night', 'rivershore', 'would', 'not', 'normally', 'consider', 'beautiful', 'taking', 'luminous', 'quality', 'talent', 'filming', 'story', 'almost', 'back', 'seat', 'filmwork', 'nearly', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'Bill', 'Linda', 'Abby', 'migrant', 'workers', 'scraping', 'survive', 'stay', 'together', 'Bill', 'Linda', 'are', 'sister', 'brother', 'Abby', 'Bill', 'lover', 'situation', 'Chicago', 'Bill', 'inadvertently', 'killed', 'bullheaded', 'boss', 'jumping', 'train', 'loaded', 'down', 'immigrants', 'ride', 'wheatfields', 'Texas', 'Panhandle', 'where', 'become', 'just', 'three', 'more', 'harvesters', 'owner', 'played', 'sweet', 'vulnerability', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'catches', 'sight', 'Abby', 'field', 'love', 'Bill', 'unfocused', 'mind', 'way', 'little', 'group', 'advance', 'conversation', 'Shepard', 'doctor', 'young', 'landowner', 'dying', 'Bill', 'Abby', 'accept', 'owner', 'offer', 'marriage', 'credit', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'do', 'reasoning', 'can', 'make', 'guy', 'happy', 'little', 'time', 'left', 'then', 'fortune', 'will', 'be', 'plan', 'snag', 'three', 'things', 'suspicious', 'foreman', 'who', 'landowner', 'son', 'trio', 'migrants', 'right', 'now', 'landowner', 'hit', 'second', 'wind', 'marrying', 'Abby', 'biggest', 'bad', 'thing', 'Abby', 'love', 'new', 'husband', 'Left', 'out', 'frustrated', 'cold', 'suffering', 'unending', 'animosity', 'foreman', 'Bill', 'only', 'intelligent', 'thing', 'can', 'think', 'leaves', 'only', 'return', 'time', 'later', 'things', 'go', 'very', 'badly.This', 'movie', 'real', 'flavour', 'what', 'early', '1900s', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'serendipity', 'travelling', 'circus', 'apparently', 'gas', 'who', 'land', 'owner', 'property', 'give', 'performances', 'exchange', 'room', 'board', 'probably', 'gas', 'things', 'happened', 'then', 'impromptu', 'little', 'entertainments', 'seemed', 'have', 'little', 'relevance', 'surroundings', 'were', 'eagerly', 'looked', 'diversions', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'folks', 'one', 'point', 'newformed', 'family', 'group', 'meet', 'wave', 'Woodrow', 'Wilson', 'passing', 'train', 'ordinary', 'people', 'doing', 'harvesting', 'only', 'touched', 'are', 'clear', 'real', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'people', 'town', 'working', 'playing', 'fighting', 'pathos', 'underclass', 'out', 'something', 'Linda', 'Manz', 'character', 'halfway', 'voiceover', ""'re"", 'only', 'here', 'once', 'should', 'have', 'nice', 'movie', 'tragic', 'beautiful', 'good', 'performances', 'especially', 'Linda', 'Manz', 'hapless', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'mercy', 'circumstances', 'powerless', 'control', 'who', 'cruel', 'lesson', 'so', 'many', 'had', 'learn', 'days', 'how', 'survive', 'own', 'Ms.', 'Manz', 'pretty', 'much', 'disappeared', 'film', 'returned', 'private', 'life', 'Too', 'bad', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'lot', 'ways', 'fact', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'advanced', 'filmwise', 'were', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Gere', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'yet', 'could', 'be', 'again', 'opinion', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'underused', 'too', 'preoccupied', 'writing', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'aficianados', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'period', 'piece', 'told', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'minimal', 'dialog']",N/A
128649,A3RB00R6GOWEK2,079215455X,frankenberry,"[41, 42]","Terrence Mallick's 1978 masterpiece is as strong today as when it was first released...or maybe even better now in comparison to the banal movies of today.  The incredible cinematography and  minimal narrative create a  mood and feeling that very few films would ever even attempt...this is like  a poem on film, but easily accessible and amazingly engrossing.  Ennio  Morricone's score is one of his best and most haunting ever.  The  entire cast is superb (Gere, Adams, Shepard), but the stand-out has always  been young Linda Manz (who also narrates throughout in a subtle almost  surreal authenticity)- her low-key performance is absolutely incredible.  The minimal narrative has been criticized by some,  but anything more  would have damaged the mood and emotion of the film.  The tragic outcome  of events is inevitable...so why clutter it with soap opera?  Compare this  film to anything else out there and you will see that it is truly  one-of-a-kind.  Seeing this movie again after almost 20 years reminded me  how many great films came out of the 70's.  It was a great period for  modern cinema --- maybe call them the &quot;days of heaven&quot; for  movie-going --- and Mallick's masterpiece stands tall to this day.  This  is a must see for any serious film buff.

Richard Gere is a Chicago factory worker, Bill, who needs to escape immediately from his job where he accidentally kills his boss.  Gere takes his lover, Abby, played by Brooke Adams, and his younger sister, played by Linda Manz, who provides poignant narration for the film, to the Texas panhandle where they become workers in the wheat fields of a wealthy farmer.  Sam Shepard is the farmer.Adams and Gere choose to identify themselves as brother and sister, because, in the words of the young female narrator, people like to talk.  Days of Heaven has manificent cinematography.  Director Terrence Malik had said that he wanted to make the most beautiful looking film ever, and Malik achieves his goal.  The film also has a beautifully haunting sound track that perfectly fits the pre-world war era, as well as the emotional situations that develop.After the harvest season is over, Shepard asks Abby and family to stay on and live on the farm with him.  Shepard's character had previously become instantly smitten with Ms. Adams.  Shepard eventually proposes to Abby, is urged to marry him by her ""brother,"" Bill.  Shepard's character is supposedly dying of some terminal illness, and Abby, as Shepard's wife, would inherit all of the wealthy farmer's money as well as his farm.Herein lies the film's major flaw.  Although they're supposedly brother and sister, Bill and Abby cannot keep their hands off each other.  They, hereby, continually and stupidly, expose themselves as lovers, not siblings.  The wealthy farmer eventually catches onto Bill and Abby's ploy.  A fatal love triangle develops between the three main characters.  The result is tragedy.Days of Heaven has some truly magnificently photographed scenes, for example the horrible plague of locusts that destroy the wheat that has been harvested.  What the locusts do not destroy, are finished off by, what becomes, a completely out of control fire.The film is very spare in its dialogue.  The excellent acting by Gere, Adams, and Shepard is not dependent on spoken lines.  I never had any difficulty understanding the emotions created in the three major characters.  Of course, Ms. Manz's voice over narration helps move the plot along nicely.Days of Heaven deservedly won an Oscar for Nestor Alemendros's masterful cinematography.",5,Magnificent film despite major plot flaw,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,2377,"['time', 'period', 'several', 'years', 'prior', 'start', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Chicago', 'factory', 'worker', 'Bill', 'who', 'escape', 'immediately', 'job', 'where', 'accidentally', 'boss', 'Gere', 'lover', 'Abby', 'played', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'younger', 'sister', 'played', 'Linda', 'Manz', 'who', 'poignant', 'narration', 'film', 'Texas', 'panhandle', 'where', 'become', 'workers', 'wheat', 'fields', 'wealthy', 'farmer', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'farmer.Adams', 'Gere', 'choose', 'identify', 'brother', 'sister', 'words', 'young', 'female', 'narrator', 'people', 'talk', 'Days', 'Heaven', 'manificent', 'cinematography', 'Director', 'Terrence', 'Malik', 'had', 'said', 'wanted', 'make', 'most', 'beautiful', 'looking', 'film', 'ever', 'Malik', 'goal', 'film', 'also', 'beautifully', 'haunting', 'sound', 'track', 'perfectly', 'pre-world', 'war', 'era', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'situations', 'develop.After', 'harvest', 'season', 'over', 'Shepard', 'Abby', 'family', 'stay', 'live', 'farm', 'Shepard', 'character', 'had', 'previously', 'become', 'instantly', 'smitten', 'Ms.', 'Adams', 'Shepard', 'eventually', 'Abby', 'urged', 'marry', 'brother', 'Bill', 'Shepard', 'character', 'supposedly', 'dying', 'terminal', 'illness', 'Abby', 'Shepard', 'wife', 'would', 'inherit', 'wealthy', 'farmer', 'money', 'as', 'well', 'farm.Herein', 'film', 'major', 'flaw', ""'re"", 'supposedly', 'brother', 'sister', 'Bill', 'Abby', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'hands', 'other', 'hereby', 'continually', 'stupidly', 'expose', 'lovers', 'not', 'siblings', 'wealthy', 'farmer', 'eventually', 'Bill', 'Abby', 'ploy', 'fatal', 'love', 'triangle', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'result', 'tragedy.Days', 'Heaven', 'truly', 'magnificently', 'photographed', 'scenes', 'example', 'horrible', 'plague', 'locusts', 'destroy', 'wheat', 'been', 'harvested', 'What', 'locusts', 'do', 'not', 'destroy', 'are', 'finished', 'off', 'what', 'completely', 'control', 'fire.The', 'film', 'very', 'spare', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Gere', 'Adams', 'Shepard', 'not', 'dependent', 'spoken', 'lines', 'never', 'had', 'difficulty', 'understanding', 'emotions', 'created', 'three', 'major', 'characters', 'course', 'Ms.', 'Manz', 'voice', 'narration', 'move', 'plot', 'nicely.Days', 'Heaven', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Nestor', 'Alemendros', 'masterful', 'cinematography']",N/A

The young and isolated parentless farmer falls in love with the woman who accepts to stay provided her ""brother"" and the girl presented as her sister who is travelling with them can stay too.The ambiguous situation did not last long and when the next harvest comes the drama come to its natural end in a cloud of locusts, an accidental fire of the wheat field and the death of the young farmer duly married to the woman who had managed to fall in love in a way or another with him but could not choose.No escape possible in that case and the funny hunt against buffaloes or rabbits or coyotes becomes a hunt after a murderer. And justice will not cost one single penny, not even for the rope.The woman and the girl have to disappear in a way or another and they do.That's a time in America when being on the road, or railroad, being on the move was part of the life style but at the same time part of the poverty and the only way for many to escape poverty, overexploitation, and crowded misery. But then obscurity and lies do not lead to a clear future and all human relations get exploded in a jiffy. Survival is then the only objective left and the means are not supposed to matter very much.Don't think this has disappeared. In our societies there is still 20 to 25% of the population that is under the level of self-sufficiency, be it in education, in financial means, in hygiene or health, and they run around trying to survive in cardboard boxes or dealing and peddling anything they can put their hands on. It is sad indeed but there is no village to look after these lost souls.

The most memorable part of the movie for me was the beautiful cinematography. Although there were critics who claimed that the shots of the beautiful scenery were overdone, I thought that the shots helped to create a sense of place for the film. Without all of the landscape shots of the fields it would have been difficult, as an audience member, to film like I was there. The shots were so beautiful that it sometimes felt as though I were looking at a painting. For me, this put the film in a different category than any other ""plantation film."" Another reason that I really enjoyed Days of Heaven was the little girl in the film. She narrated in a way that was authentic for someone in her place. She was young and spunky and I liked how she just said things plainly. The story was also good because it had plenty of twists and turns. Though they were predictable at times, overall, the story held my interest. Still, I think that what makes this movie so great is the visual side. I seemed to be entranced with the beautiful imagery. If this film had been made in a studio, it would have failed completely. I do not think there is any way that the film could be as great without the shots of landscape. Filming the movie out of doors and in a place that looked authentic was vital to its success. I think the filmmakers knew exactly what they were doing with the long shots of scenery because it gave the film a feel of a summer afternoon on a plantation.

128661,A106016KSI0YQ,079215455X,Jay Dickson,"[6, 10]","Many cineastes reverentially point to Terence Malick's 1978 DAYS OF HEAVEN, released just at the tail end of the great experimental period in Hollywood history after the dismantling of the old studio system, as an example of what movies could have become had they not followed the profitmaking path of summer blockbusters like STAR WARS (which was released the year earlier). Certainly Malick's film is haunting and worth seeing--if only for the famed cinematography of Nestor Alemendros and the beautiful score by Ennio Morricone--, but it's also much more of mess than most people are willing to admit. Conceived as a tribute in part to silent film, Malick attempted to do away with as much dialogue as possible, relying instead on his beautiful images to tell his story. Unfortunately in keeping with his ideas he cast his lead actors almost entirely because of their physical beauty, and none of them (with the exception of Sam Shepard as a lonely wealthy farmer) up to the challenge. Though stunning, Brooke Adams, as the migrant worker urged by her boyfriend to marry the dying Shepard so as to inherit his money, is not particularly interesting, and as the boyfriend Richard Gere is at his absolute dreamiest but was not at this point even passable as an actor. As Gere's twelve year-old sister and the film's narrator, Linda Manz is visually stunning, but her thick New York accent for the voiceover narration makes no sense at all (especially since her character is supposed to be from Chicago).The film's story is also a bit of a mess. Working against narrative drive by means of surprising jump cuts, Malick again trusts too much to his images to tell what comes to be a somewhat complex plot that seems lifted mostly from THE WINGS OF THE DOVE but that also lifts elements from GIANT, AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY, the Torah, and also from Malick's previous film, the far superior BADLANDS. As if all this weren't enough, during one lull in the story Malick throws in for no particular reason a visiting flying circus (complete with resident dwarf) onto Shephard's farm on the Texas Panhandle. The film's pointed critique of capitalism seems lost among all this kerfuffle, and at times Malick's devotion to lyric beauty renders the plight of his migrant workers absolutely ridiculous. Famously, Malick and Alemednros filmed all of the outdoor scenes during the violet (or magic) hour, and so all that physical labor by the migrant workers seems relegated to the coolest hour of the day, and that hour only; moreover, even the hardest toil and the lowest of wages do not seem to do more than artistically muss up Gere's beautiful expensive 70s haircut. But the film is still worth seeing just for the images alone--it would be hard to beat the beauty of the scenes where the workers swarm onto a stopping train, or of their silhouettes flailing against a  backdrop of flames during the  film's climactic nighttime prairie fire.",3,The violet hour,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,2929,"['Many', 'cineastes', 'reverentially', 'point', 'Terence', 'Malick', '1978', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'HEAVEN', 'released', 'just', 'tail', 'end', 'great', 'experimental', 'period', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'dismantling', 'old', 'studio', 'system', 'example', 'what', 'movies', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'had', 'not', 'followed', 'profitmaking', 'path', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'was', 'released', 'year', 'earlier', 'Certainly', 'Malick', 'film', 'haunting', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'famed', 'cinematography', 'Nestor', 'Alemendros', 'beautiful', 'score', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'mess', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'admit', 'Conceived', 'tribute', 'part', 'silent', 'film', 'Malick', 'attempted', 'do', 'away', 'as', 'much', 'dialogue', 'possible', 'relying', 'instead', 'beautiful', 'images', 'tell', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'keeping', 'ideas', 'cast', 'lead', 'actors', 'almost', 'entirely', 'physical', 'beauty', 'none', 'exception', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'lonely', 'wealthy', 'farmer', 'challenge', 'stunning', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'migrant', 'worker', 'urged', 'boyfriend', 'marry', 'dying', 'Shepard', 'so', 'inherit', 'money', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'boyfriend', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'absolute', 'dreamiest', 'was', 'not', 'point', 'even', 'passable', 'actor', 'Gere', 'twelve', 'year-old', 'sister', 'film', 'narrator', 'Linda', 'Manz', 'visually', 'stunning', 'thick', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'sense', 'especially', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'Chicago', '.The', 'film', 'story', 'also', 'bit', 'mess', 'Working', 'narrative', 'drive', 'means', 'surprising', 'jump', 'cuts', 'Malick', 'again', 'too', 'much', 'images', 'tell', 'what', 'be', 'somewhat', 'complex', 'plot', 'lifted', 'mostly', 'THE', 'WINGS', 'THE', 'DOVE', 'also', 'lifts', 'elements', 'GIANT', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'TRAGEDY', 'Torah', 'also', 'Malick', 'previous', 'film', 'far', 'superior', 'BADLANDS', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'one', 'lull', 'story', 'Malick', 'particular', 'reason', 'visiting', 'flying', 'circus', 'complete', 'resident', 'dwarf', 'Shephard', 'farm', 'Texas', 'Panhandle', 'film', 'pointed', 'critique', 'capitalism', 'lost', 'kerfuffle', 'times', 'Malick', 'devotion', 'lyric', 'beauty', 'renders', 'plight', 'migrant', 'workers', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'Famously', 'Malick', 'Alemednros', 'filmed', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'violet', 'magic', 'hour', 'so', 'physical', 'labor', 'migrant', 'workers', 'relegated', 'coolest', 'hour', 'day', 'hour', 'only', 'moreover', 'even', 'hardest', 'toil', 'lowest', 'wages', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'do', 'more', 'artistically', 'muss', 'up', 'Gere', 'beautiful', 'expensive', '70s', 'haircut', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'images', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'beat', 'beauty', 'scenes', 'where', 'workers', 'swarm', 'stopping', 'train', 'silhouettes', 'flailing', 'backdrop', 'flames', 'film', 'climactic', 'nighttime', 'prairie', 'fire']",N/A

The musical score - not unlike TTRL - is intoxicating and the acting is superb. You will find more voice overs but that creates a realism that can't be strewn together otherwise.I believe this was one of Richard Gere's first films, if not THE first, and he does a wonderful job. If nothing else, Malick has an uncanny nack for discovering untapped talent - also see Adrian Brody, Jim Caviezel, and John C. Reily from The Thin Red Line. Sam Shepard also delivers a very solid performance.The plot is better than amazon makes it out to be and there is a hang-onto-the-edge-of-your-seat-through-the-woods-chase-scene(sorry, I just had to) just like there was in TTRL.

128673,A27CHILBK6HIL2,079215455X,Kaya Savas,"[164, 169]","MOVIE:Terrence Malick is one of the greatest filmmakers alive, and after Sergio Leone he is my second favorite director of all time. In his career that spans almost 40 years he has only made four feature length films. What I love about Malick's films is that they are poetry; they break all the conventions of filmmaking. When you sit down to watch a Terrence Malick film you are readying yourself for an experience. The way he examines human nature in every single one of his films is extraordinary. Every one of his films also deals with man's impact on nature and he slowly erases the lines between sanity and insanity. His directorial debut was with Badlands starring Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek; a haunting story of lovers on the run from the law. His next film is still undoubtedly one of the most moving pieces of cinema ever created, Days Of Heaven.Days Of Heaven tells the story of Bill (Richard Gere) and Abby (Brooke Adams); two young people in love trying to make ends meet and find work. The two go around pretending to be brother and sister as to protect themselves from the outside world. At the beginning of the film Bill gets in a tussle at the steel mill and accidentally kills his boss. Now Bill, Abby and Linda (Linda Manz) hop a train to go work on a farm to harvest wheat. The story is told through Linda's perspective. Linda is the real sister of Bill and she is barely a teenager. It's interesting that Malick lets the story unfold through the eyes of an innocent child; I think it gives complex situations in the film a simpler point of view. As the story unfolds and they work on the farm Bill finds out that the owner of the farm is dying of a terminal illness. The farmer is played by Sam Shepard in his first major role. Bill hatches a plan for Abby to get the farmer to fall in love with her. That way when he dies he will leave all his assets to her and they will become rich. As can be imagined after a full year passes the farmer is still alive and tensions begin to grow that leads to an inevitable climax.The number one aspect of this film that garners so much attention is the cinematography. The story goes that Nestor Almendros started the picture but about a fourth of the way through he had to leave due to a prior commitment. Cinematographer Haskell Wexler came in and shot the rest of the picture according to Almendros's standards, but in the end didn't receive any credit on the film. Almendros went on to win the Oscar for Best Cinematography that year. All quarrels aside one can't deny the brilliance of the film's photography. Every frame is crafted with absolute detail that in some cases will give you goose-bumps. They shot most of the film during ""magic hour""; that twilight period right before the sun sets. It creates a perfect backlight that if framed correctly can create haunting silhouettes. It seems as if there is always a ring of fire on the horizon that is slowly getting closer, which it in fact does. During the scene of the locust plague a lantern breaks in the wheat fields and the entire farm erupts into flames. It symbolizes rage in the characters as tensions mount, but I don't want to spoil anything for those who want to experience the film for the first time. All in all this film is a visual feast that will stay in your mind's eye.Since the film is extremely light on dialogue it relies on two major elements. Cinematography being the first thing I discussed and Ennio Morricone's score being the second. Morricone's incredibly dark and foreboding score is a haunting masterpiece. It underscores the human conflicts being depicted in the film and of course has tragedy spelled out plain and simple with the tone right from the beginning. The first time I saw the film I cried because of the subtle power of this Oscar nominated score. The haunting elements of it will resonate with you for quite some time, and honestly this score is the major source of emotion in the film. It accentuates Malick's themes perfectly.So, what is this film ultimately about? One could spend all their time writing about a Terrence Malick film and every word could be wrong and right at the same time. His films need to be experienced, because it is absolutely impossible to try to describe how his films affect you. In my head I saw this film as an exploration of love and how human nature is a flaw that can allow our emotions to consume our rational side. If you've seen The Thin Red Line, Badlands or The New World then you should have a good idea of what Days Of Heaven will be like. It's a surprisingly short film at only 94 minutes, especially if you compare how long his last two films were. Thanks for sticking with me for this entire review/analysis. I really like to do more than the average critique when it comes to important films like this.SPECIAL FEATURES:Audio Commentary:Since Terrance Malick is the most elusive filmmaker ever (not a single interview ever?) the commentary track features editor Bill Weber, art director Jack Fisk, costume designer Patricia Norris, and casting director Dianne Crittenden. This is a fascinating track that really delves into just how much detail can be found in every single frame of the movie; a must for film enthusiasts.Audio Interview With Richard Gere:An interview conducted in 2007 just for this release. Richard Gere examines how he came to doing the movie. He discusses how he really wasn't into film but rather theater. However, he saw Badlands and was immediately interested if Terrence Malick was directing. He does ramble a bit, but he does offer some insight. The fact that it's a 22 minute audio interview set to stills and footage of the movie makes it kind of a bore to sit through.Video Interview With Sam Shepherd:This 12 minute interview from 2002 is an interesting look at how Malick got Shepherd into acting. He talks about how he was more into writing at the time, but he decided to do it just for the hell of it.Video Interview With John Bailey:Bailey was Nestor Almendros's camera operator and this is by far the most interesting interview on the DVD. It's a 20 minute interview and it is incredibly in depth. He uses a lot of lingo that may go over the head of casual viewers. He explains in detail all the techniques they used and it really opens up a lot. It's a really fascinating interview that uses visual examples throughout as he talks.Video Interview With Haskell Wexler:Wexler was the cinematographer who took over for Almendros and in the end received no credit for his work on the film. In this 11 minute interview he explains his relationship with Malick and how he came to take over for Almendros. It's a great first hand account from the man himself.41-Page Booklet:The booklet contains an essay by Adrian Martin and a chapter from Nestor Almendros's autobiography.VIDEO:When you buy a Criterion DVD you are paying for perfection. This remastered version was supervised and approved by Terrence Malick. The original 1.78:1 aspect ratio is maintained exactly with absolutely zero flaws in the transfer. The new high definition transfer was created from a new 35mm interpositive struck from the 35mm A/B roll original negative. Thousands of instances of dirt and scratches were removed and the resolution is magnificent because they mastered the DVD at the highest bit rate possible. I just wonder when Criterion is going to make the move to Blu-ray?AUDIO:A brand new Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track was created for this release. The old track was tossed and this new track was remastered at 24-bits from the original 4.1 magnetic tracks. Every effort possible was implemented to reduce clicks, hiss and crackle. This is fantastic, I love Criterion so much.BOTTOM LINE:Days Of Heaven is one of my favorite films of all time and I certainly think it's Malick's best. The film will overwhelm you with its visual power and you certainly won't forget it.

Yet he was a poor choice - too soft and pretty for a Chicago steelworker who kills a foreman for looking at him wrong, who later goes on the lam in the wilderness with his &#34;family.&#34; A better choice would have been someone tougher and meaner-looking - Jeff Bridges, Tommy Lee Jones, Harvey Keitel, even John Travolta or Nicolas Cage would have been an improvement, assuming any of these were the right age at the time, or could have been made up to look like a man in his late twenties or early thirties.Otherwise, the film was beautifully shot and contained just the right mix of mystery and exposition to keep the viewer engaged. I especially relish when the action pauses and we are treated to a view of animals, doing their animal things. &#34;The Thin Red Line&#34; was full of this, and in &#34;Days of Heaven,&#34; the shots of the locusts made them look so adorable that it was hard to see them as the devastating menace they are.

For me, DOH is a perfect film, a work of art first, and an example of what a director uninterested in hollywood film styles is capable of creating.  The story of three lower-class drifters running from a murder in Chicago who end up working on a Texas wheat farm,where the owner falls for one of the drifters.  Her lover, the killer, encouragers her to marry the farmer when he learns the farmer is dying.  Malick hangs the entirety of creation on this frame: the cycle of seasons and nature, human existence in the context of this cycle, the wracks of love, and the complexity of an artist's mind viewing all of these phenomena. If this sounds dry, then the photographic style of Nestor Alemendros and Haskell Wexler unifies this world in a stark vision of pre-modern life.  Linda Mantz's narration, an oblique proto-hipster prose poem, works in counterpoint to the film, like a great symphony,  and in fact is the greatest element among the great elements.  Somber, calm, apocalyptic, Days of Heaven isn't for everyone.

Running from the law and afraid of the social consequences of living together unwed, he and his girlfriend Abby (Brooke Adams) conceal the true nature of their relationship as they travel the rails out West with his little sister in search of work.

128701,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,079215455X,Only-A-Child,"[10, 10]","You can only begin to really appreciate Terence Malick's ''Days of Heaven'' narrative when you realize that Linda Manz has stolen the film, and when you realize that this was Malick's intention. I imagine that he spent more time directing her than all the other cast members combined. Manz's ""Linda"", like Scout in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", is both narrator and character in the story. But Malick takes this even further as she also serves the same off-screen narrator function that Orsen Welles did in ""The Magnificent Ambersons""; providing more of a parallel commentary than just a narration. And like ""Ambersons"", the authority of her commentary is sometimes challenged by the images on the screen. This makes the tone and content of her narration an element of the film's message and significance, not just the definitions of them found in ""TKM"".Basically the entire story is told by her, speaking sometime after the events have taken place and commenting about them as they were seen from her nai've perspective at the time. Manz was 16 when the film was made, convincingly playing a character of about 12. Her face and voice combine to present a child who has already experienced and survived a lot. She has seen the worst and it has made her resigned and emotionless; seemingly beyond surprise. But her face has a subtle expressiveness that visually communicates a hidden depth of feeling, and the attentive viewer understands that rather than being mired in despair she was full of wonder at the things she was then experiencing.As someone commented earlier, watch for how the four principal characters represent the four elements; earth (Linda), water (Abby), fire (Bill), and wind (the farmer), with Earth the least transitory and the one that remains at the end. And watch how Linda follows or chases after everyone to whom she becomes close-even in the closing scene with her new friend.Just understand, as you watch ""Days of Heaven"", that it is the story of Linda and that the actions of the three adult characters (who are actually on-screen more than Linda) are significant only for the impact on her; and are presented from her subjective, somewhat distanced and detached perspective.The film inspired amazing comments by Roger Ebert:""Children know that adults can be seized with sudden passions for one another, but children are concerned primarily with how these passions affect themselves: Am I more or less secure, more or less loved, because there has been this emotional realignment among the adults who form my world?""""This is a movie made by a man who knew how something felt, and found a way to evoke it in us.

Lunde,"[6, 14]","I rewatched &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; in the new 70mm wide screen release with high hopes of recapturing the magic I sensed when I first saw it in 1978. Without question, it is one of the most beautifully photographed  American films ever, and on that basis alone I give it a hearty three  stars. What disturbs me, however, is what I now recognize as the complete  miscasting of Richard Gere and Brooke Adams in the two central roles of the  film. Compounding this error is the banal script that allows, with the  exception of the brilliant Linda Manz's character, modern conversations  coming out of the mouths of uneducated early century characters. People  then simply did not talk and behave like Gere and Adams do in the film. In  fact, the conversations are so loose that I suspect they were not memorized  but extemporaneouly spoken. So much effort is spent visually recreating the  era that this kind of miscue is unfortunate. The same kind of problem  emerges in &quot;The Piano&quot;, with its new age music and banal modern  banter out of the mouths of 19th century characters. When you watch period  pieces in Russian films for example, you are immediately thrust back into  time. The actors capture the inflections, manners, and behaviors so  completely that there is no question of the period. This is intentional,  not accidental. American fims, for some reason, never take the time to do  it right, and this film is a prime example. Watch it and marvel at the  photography, but don't wince too much as Gere prances about as he does in  &quot;Breathless&quot;. And he still mumbles no matter what time he is  supposed to be in. Also, compare Malik's recent &quot;The Thin Red  Line&quot;, clearly a real masterpiece in all categories, including  faithfulness of character, place, and time.",3,Not Quite the Hype,961372800,"06 19, 2000",2000,1805,"['rewatched', 'quot', 'Days', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'new', '70mm', 'wide', 'screen', 'release', 'high', 'hopes', 'recapturing', 'magic', 'sensed', 'when', 'first', 'saw', '1978', 'question', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'American', 'films', 'ever', 'basis', 'alone', 'give', 'hearty', 'three', 'stars', 'What', 'however', 'what', 'now', 'recognize', 'complete', 'miscasting', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'two', 'central', 'roles', 'film', 'Compounding', 'error', 'banal', 'script', 'exception', 'brilliant', 'Linda', 'Manz', 'character', 'modern', 'conversations', 'coming', 'mouths', 'uneducated', 'early', 'century', 'characters', 'People', 'then', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'talk', 'behave', 'Gere', 'Adams', 'do', 'film', 'fact', 'conversations', 'are', 'so', 'loose', 'suspect', 'were', 'not', 'memorized', 'extemporaneouly', 'spoken', 'So', 'much', 'effort', 'spent', 'visually', 'recreating', 'era', 'kind', 'miscue', 'unfortunate', 'same', 'kind', 'problem', 'emerges', 'quot', 'Piano', 'quot', 'new', 'age', 'music', 'banal', 'modern', 'banter', 'mouths', '19th', 'century', 'characters', 'When', 'watch', 'period', 'pieces', 'Russian', 'films', 'example', 'are', 'immediately', 'thrust', 'back', 'time', 'actors', 'capture', 'inflections', 'manners', 'behaviors', 'so', 'completely', 'question', 'period', 'intentional', 'not', 'accidental', 'American', 'fims', 'reason', 'never', 'take', 'time', 'do', 'right', 'film', 'prime', 'example', 'Watch', 'marvel', 'photography', 'do', ""n't"", 'wince', 'too', 'much', 'Gere', 'about', 'quot', 'Breathless', 'quot', 'still', 'matter', 'what', 'time', 'supposed', 'be', 'Also', 'compare', 'Malik', 'recent', 'quot', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'quot', 'clearly', 'real', 'masterpiece', 'categories', 'including', 'faithfulness', 'character', 'place', 'time']",N/A

I admit that the setting was very beautiful, undulating, expansive, and more.  The mansion in the middle of thousands of acres of wheat fields was an impressive touch.  The problem was with the plot and the acting.  I admit that my mild hearing loss may have robbed me of a sentence of two of dialogue here (hear?) and there.  However, I had to check the liner notes on the DVD case to reassure myself that the man and the woman were supposed to be traveling together incognito as brother and sister to help in their escape from a murder in Chicago.  Their relationship never really developed into anything coherent during the movie even allowing for their intential misrepresentation.  Her relationship with the young landowner was a better developed relationship.The director used a juvenile as a sort of narrator throughout the film.  I had a hard time hearing much of what she said and I came away thinking that it was a gimic that didn't work.  As a matter of fact, her character was rather unnecessary to the movie, in my opinion. There were times in the movie where the work being done was alternately instructive and ridiculous.  I'm reminded of one scene where Richard Gere seems deeply involved with the seriousness of his job as he takes a bundle of cut wheat and moves it from one pile to another one three feet away. There is a scene of disaster that made me wish for the better rendition from ""The Good Earth"".

The characters who insist on something they have not earned start a chain  reaction of events that eventually decide their fate.  Bill trades Abby's  love for the hopes of inheriting the farm.

So I had another look all these years later to find I had not been mistaken. The story told by our 12 year old narrator, Linda, is dispassionately told, though I still couldn't decipher her accent in places. The panoramic images are wonderful.The evocation of ca 1916 rural life are fine, though the toughness of labour is quaintly superficial. Malik's inclination to swerve off into reveries of nature, fish goggling a fallen wine glass in a river, or grasshoppers sawing through the crop, are exquisite. They also indicate the director's interest in playing the macroscopic against The Big Picture, something he was to develop in,'The Thin Red Line', which is an altogether more powerful work.Essentially, there's not sufficient emotion generated by the menage a trois to move me, not withstanding that a 12 year old child is relating this chapter of her life. No doubt the mansion poised on a treeless knoll bespeaks the soulessness of Shephard's singular life, but it poses pre-eminently as a preposterous film set.No one seems to know what they are doing out there on the prairie, and crucially there is a poverty of attracting juice between the lovers. Jason Robard's cameo is more memorable than the leads, mainly for his 'look': a face sharing the furrows of the fields he's lived in. He alone does belong. A case could be made for displacement as the theme of the film.The drama of the police hunt near film's end is brilliantly choreographed. Again, the tragedy plays second place to the cinematography. Morrocine scores the film with customary elan, recruiting guitar whiz, Kottke for bucolic ambience and cajun fiddle maestro, Doug Kershaw whose gig finds its way onto celluloid.

Perhaps the greatest element of the film is the lack of a complex plot, the structure of the film is rather simple. Malick draws great symbolism in the film's setting of a place of harvest and growth. As two runaways find a home in the countryside, the plot unravels. The cinematography alone makes this film worth while and worth close analysis. The sweeping landscapes are breathtaking. My favorite aspect of the film is the relationships between Richard Gere's character and Sam Shepherd's character. The audience watches as the farmer (Shepherd) gains purpose again as he finds happiness with Gere's girlfriend. This is further illustrated in the growth and product of the harvest--just as Gere and his girlfriend grow and assume good positions and a good life, without having to work. This film is really a unique film but one that I think trudges on a bit too long. There were moments in this film where I found myself bored. I think the plot was a little too predictable and frustrating. I didn't want the people to be able to run away from the wrongdoing they had committed. The film was strong in the unpredictable action of Gere killing the farmer--that was indeed shocking. I thought Brooke Adams was an interesting choice for the female lead--I didn't think she was a good actress and I thought she wasn't alluring enough to cause so much upheaval. This made the film all the more interesting to me, though. Audiences get a good feel of the land at harvest time and all the vulnerable aspects of it as well.

Smith-Peter,"[2, 2]","Set in the Texas Panhandle during Woodrow Wilson's presidency, the film technically is about a love triangle between Bill (Richard Gere) Abby (Brooke Adams) and a rich farmer (Sam Shepard).  Bill and Abby, who are traveling along with Bill's sister, Linda (Linda Manz), pretend to be brother and sister but are really lovers.  Things go fine until the farmer is taken with Abby.What strikes me is that nature is really the subject of the film, particularly in the first half. The characters are almost entirely outside.  Heaven in this part deals with the heavens, the skies, as we see many shots of people backlit against a vast sky.  Bill and Abby even sleep out in the hay when it snows.  Their relationship, although it provokes some taunting by fellow migrant workers, isn't presented as fundamentally problematic.  They're living in a state of nature.Then, however, Bill convinces Abby to let the farmer court and marry her.  A key scene is where Bill enters the farmer's house, which has up until then been a looming presence on the horizon, but not an interior experience.  Now Bill has entered into a new world and is no longer in a state of nature.  Here is where Linda comes into her own.  She finally has a place and doesn't have to work all the time and is learning quite a bit from the farmer.  But Richard Gere has to come back and mess it all up (like he has many a movie).  His second return sets in motion the tragedy the experienced viewer has been expecting, and the emotional detonation is intense.I don't understand why so many people complained about the emotional minimalism.  Frankly I found it a relief to not have to have every turn explained, foreshadowed, and repeated again and again. Everything was implied rather than stated.

128722,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,079215455X,Steven Johnson,"[0, 0]","Days of Heaven is the odd film which is less compelling for what it is, and more interesting for how it is made.It tells the loose story of three drifters, a man, his girlfriend, and his little sister, who leave Chicago to work in a wheat farm in the country. The owner of the farm falls in love with the woman, they marry, and the four make a little family unit. We see the passage of time and the challenges and strains their relationships take, which ultimately lead to a tragic ending.The weird thing is, though, I kind of don't care about what happened. I almost don't know if it matters. Like The Tree of Life, another minimalist story by director Terrence Malick, what happens matters less than how it happens. The landscape, for one, is very striking; we see acres and acres of wheat farms, which represents both the possibilities and limitations these characters face. They could realistically go anywhere they please, but they confine themselves to this old Victorian house.They are also isolated from what is going on in the rest of the world; we are given only hints of when we are when the story starts, and then see a newspaper headline revealing the President is Wilson, and at the very end see soldiers returning home from World War I. Contemporary society, though, is extraneous to these characters, who stay in their own little world.This quality is what makes the movie simultaneously compelling, but also frustrating. Seeing these four individuals often shot in isolation, or set against the backdrop of nature (there are very few interior shots), these people and these events could exist in any time, any place. Given this broad quality, though, it astounds me that the film seems to get its emotional payoff from the narrative rather than by the more compelling, existentialist motifs the visuals provide. Like The Tree of Life, it's as though the film misses its strong suit and instead focuses on something it's less equipped for.

128723,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,079215455X,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[34, 36]","Terence Malick's ""Days of Heaven"" is famous for its breathtaking images and beautiful musical score.  It is also known as the last film the great director made before his self-imposed 20-year exile from the film industry.  Watching ""Days of Heaven"" makes you wonder what great works Malick would have produced if he decided to continue filmmaking throughout the Eighties and the Nineties.  His absence from the industry truly was a loss for all film enthusiasts everywhere.""Days of Heaven"" is set in the year 1916.  America is becoming more and more industrialized as time goes on.  In one Chicago steelmill, Bill (Richard Gere) attacks a foreman and is forced to go on the run.  He takes along his girlfriend, Abby (Brooke Adams) and his younger sister Linda (Linda Manz) with him to Texas.  The three of them find employment as laborers with a wealthy farmer (Sam Shepard) with Bill passing off Abby as his sister.  Eventually, the farmer and Abby marry after Bill tells her he discovered that the farmer is ill and will soon die.  Once the farmer passes away, Bill and Abby will be able to live off his wealth and leave behind their nomadic lifestyle.  However, the farmer manages to hold onto his health and tragedy strikes when he eventually discovers the true relationship between Bill and Abby.All of the praise ""Days of Heaven"" has received over its visual splendor is well deserved.  Malick has always had an eye for filming nature in all its beauty and the way he employs the sky, the streams, the wheat fields, and the animals of the prairies in his narrative essentially establishes nature itself as a character in the film.  The musical score of Ennio Morricone is equally compelling and perfectly captures the varying moods the characters go through.  However, the one element that keeps ""Days of Heaven"" from being considered a true masterpiece is its story.  The love triangle that lies at the core of the film is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill soap opera drama.  Manz's recollection of the events through her narration gives the events an added dimension as the tale becomes intertwined with the loss of her innocent childhood.

128726,A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT,079215455X,"technoguy ""jack""","[4, 5]","Days of Heaven is an extraordinary cinematic achievement by writer-director Terrence Malik.A good story,good acting, visually stunning cinematography and a beautiful music score by Morricone. Days of Heaven (1978) is vaguely biblical both in tone and plot (&the; title itself). Primarily a tragic love story, the characters and the plot are almost dwarfed by the overwhelming scale and the beauty of the film's nature imagery, the story would be told through visuals. Very few people really want to give that priority to image. Usually the director gives priority to the actors and the story but here the story was told through the power of imagery.This was the power of cinema to engage the audience directly.We also listen carefully to the soundscape of nature and the human voices,bringing cinema back to its humble origins, a ""physical"" phenomenon that elicits awe and wonder before any impulse to understand and interpret it in terms of its meaning. The sketchy tale is left simple so that it might be elevated to the realm of mythic archetype via plaintive aestheticism.There is a sense of haunting loss through evanescent imagery,shooting in the magic hour between sunset and dusk,as we stare at the vast Texas panhandle landscape, evoking the intimacy /disconnection of man's tense relationship with nature.The effect of floating in and out of visual events like a visiting spectre,is dreamlike.Sam Shepherd said he felt his character was more like a ghost than that of real flesh and blood.Malik's editing,turning away from character into glimpses of wheatfields swaying in the breeze or herds of buffalo, beginning scenes midway through a tracking shot and ending them before its finished(also cutting to black or a dissolve).Malik's recurring motifs of movement-train rides,boat trips,wagon trains,flowing water,rolling clouds, cattle processions,Linda's strolls with older friend-suggest impermanence.It's the stasis of the middle period on the farm that brings the `days of heaven',not Farmer's wealth.It's the vernacular voice of the teenage girl Linda that steers us through the film.The 'voiceover' is the expression of the 'inner workings' of the main characters, from the child's POV. And what (for me) it accomplishes, is neutralizing the good and the bad, through the expression of an innocent child, whose life is tempered by hardness. We see extreme characters doing extreme things, juxtaposed against nature and it's hardness, all of which, to the still naive and optimistic little girl, is simply ""life on lifes terms"", no true good, no true evil, and to be expected. I believe the voiceover is an integral part of the film. We do not feel the full passion of the adults because it is not her passion: it is seen at a distance, as a phenomenon, like the weather, or the plague of grasshoppers that signals the beginning of the end. It is flat, resigned, emotionless.Her voice is of the poetry of loss.The plague of grasshoppers,the fields of flame bringing to the insignificant humans a sense of biblical misfortune.There are some parallels with the film Giant and the plot is similar to Wings of a Dove.The film earned Malik the award of Best Director at Cannes.Such was its intoxicating perfectionism it took another 20 years before he could make his next film(The Thin Red Line).",5,No heaven on earth,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,3306,"['Days', 'Heaven', 'extraordinary', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'writer-director', 'Terrence', 'Malik.A', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'visually', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'music', 'score', 'Morricone', 'Days', 'Heaven', '1978', 'vaguely', 'biblical', 'tone', 'plot', 'title', 'Primarily', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'characters', 'plot', 'are', 'almost', 'dwarfed', 'overwhelming', 'scale', 'beauty', 'film', 'nature', 'imagery', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'told', 'visuals', 'Very', 'few', 'people', 'really', 'want', 'give', 'priority', 'image', 'Usually', 'director', 'priority', 'actors', 'story', 'here', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'power', 'imagery.This', 'was', 'power', 'cinema', 'engage', 'audience', 'directly.We', 'also', 'carefully', 'soundscape', 'nature', 'human', 'voices', 'bringing', 'cinema', 'back', 'humble', 'origins', 'physical', 'phenomenon', 'awe', 'wonder', 'impulse', 'understand', 'interpret', 'terms', 'meaning', 'sketchy', 'tale', 'left', 'simple', 'might', 'be', 'elevated', 'realm', 'mythic', 'archetype', 'plaintive', 'sense', 'haunting', 'loss', 'evanescent', 'imagery', 'shooting', 'magic', 'hour', 'sunset', 'dusk', 'stare', 'vast', 'Texas', 'panhandle', 'landscape', 'evoking', 'intimacy', '/disconnection', 'man', 'tense', 'relationship', 'nature.The', 'effect', 'floating', 'visual', 'events', 'visiting', 'spectre', 'dreamlike.Sam', 'Shepherd', 'said', 'felt', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'ghost', 'real', 'flesh', 'blood.Malik', 'editing', 'turning', 'away', 'character', 'glimpses', 'wheatfields', 'swaying', 'breeze', 'herds', 'buffalo', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'midway', 'tracking', 'shot', 'ending', 'finished', 'also', 'cutting', 'black', 'dissolve', '.Malik', 'recurring', 'motifs', 'movement-train', 'rides', 'boat', 'trips', 'wagon', 'trains', 'flowing', 'water', 'rolling', 'clouds', 'cattle', 'processions', 'Linda', 'strolls', 'older', 'friend-suggest', 'impermanence.It', 'stasis', 'middle', 'period', 'farm', 'days', 'heaven', 'not', 'Farmer', 'wealth.It', 'vernacular', 'voice', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Linda', 'film.The', 'expression', ""'inner"", 'workings', 'main', 'characters', 'child', 'POV', 'what', 'neutralizing', 'good', 'bad', 'expression', 'innocent', 'child', 'life', 'tempered', 'hardness', 'see', 'extreme', 'characters', 'doing', 'extreme', 'things', 'juxtaposed', 'nature', 'hardness', 'still', 'naive', 'optimistic', 'little', 'girl', 'simply', 'life', 'lifes', 'terms', 'true', 'good', 'true', 'evil', 'be', 'expected', 'believe', 'voiceover', 'integral', 'part', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'full', 'passion', 'adults', 'not', 'passion', 'seen', 'distance', 'phenomenon', 'weather', 'plague', 'grasshoppers', 'signals', 'beginning', 'end', 'flat', 'resigned', 'emotionless.Her', 'voice', 'poetry', 'loss.The', 'plague', 'grasshoppers', 'fields', 'flame', 'bringing', 'insignificant', 'humans', 'sense', 'biblical', 'are', 'parallels', 'film', 'Giant', 'plot', 'similar', 'Wings', 'Dove.The', 'film', 'earned', 'Malik', 'award', 'Best', 'Director', 'Cannes.Such', 'was', 'intoxicating', 'perfectionism', 'took', '20', 'years', 'could', 'make', 'next', 'film', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line']",N/A

And I'm sure many of you can conclude that the visuals are important to the film because of a lacking in obvious emotional strength.  This led to the film's first weakness in that it relied too heavily on the distractingly brilliant cinematography to make up for the uninteresting, often cliched father-son story director Sam Mendes chose to focus on rather than the more interesting and original version of the father-son tale (between Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and Daniel Craig).  But in 'Days of Heaven', the muted emotions are toned down for a reason.The film surrounds a love triangle between a little girl's brother (Richard Gere), his lover (Brooke Adams) and her terminally ill farmer husband (played by Sam Shepard, who she married for the purpose of inheriting his money after his inevitable death).  But this story isn't being told from the perspective of those three adults, but from the perspective of that little girl (played by Linda Manz, who hauntingly provides a voice-over of stunning power) who is, at the time, naive and unaware of the deeper regions of each adult's psyche.  She is retelling a part of her life and coming to terms with it.Many of the emotions and strong story points of the love triangle are, with dialogue, rather succinct.  But what expresses the emotion is not their speech, but the landscape and nature itself.  For instance, there is an intense moment of furious anger, and the oncoming danger is represented by a swarm of disgusting locusts, while the anger is presented as a thriving, uncontrollable power by an equally uncontained fire sprawling across the Texan prairie.  Terrence Malick did a masterful job in realizing the power of telling the story from the little girl's perspective, taking advantage of a great cinematographer and a great landscape.I recommend this film to painters, fans of romance, fans of generally wonderful cinema and to fans of brilliant cinematography.  It may seem overlong to some depending on how you like the mood and emotions of a film to be expressed.

Don't you dare, though:  the soundtrack by Ennio Morricone and others (Leo Kottke, Doug Kershaw, Camille Saint-Saens...) provides perfect accompaniment to this spare and tragic tale.",5,Stunning and mesmerizing glimpse into very private territory,1039132800,"12 6, 2002",2002,958,"['director', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'made', 'few', 'films', 'stature', 'legendary', 'film', 'buffs', 'industry', 'players', 'different', 'reasons', 'film', 'wrote', 'possibly', 'best', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'admire', 'Malick', 'Winner', 'well-deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Cinematography', 'late', 'great', 'Director', 'Photography', 'Nestor', 'Almendros', 'who', 'wrote', 'wonderful', 'book', 'cinematography', 'way', 'called', 'MAN', 'A', 'CAMERA', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'HEAVEN', 'nothing', 'so', 'well', 'perfectly', 'place', 'time', 'way', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'was', 'incorrect', 'was', 'not', 'Great', 'Depression', 'pre-WWI', 'film', 'lot', 'little', 'so', 'beautiful', 'so', 'well-told', 'one', 'could', 'turn', 'sound', 'understand', 'whole', 'story', 'Do', ""n't"", 'dare', 'soundtrack', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'others', 'Leo', 'Kottke', 'Doug', 'Kershaw', 'Camille', 'Saint-Saens', 'perfect', 'accompaniment', 'spare', 'tragic', 'tale']",N/A

Bill, having accidentally murdered his foreman at the steel-mill he worked at, takes his girlfriend Abby and his kid-sister Linda on a train down to Texas to become farm workers. The plot thickens when Bill finds out the farmer their working for is terminally ill and is attracted to Abby. Convincing Abby to accept the farmer's advances in the hope that he will die and the farm will be inherited by them, Bill unwittingly sets in motion events which lead to the movies apocalyptic climax and its subdued ending. The power of this movie is not in its plot but in the absolutely majestic images. It won the Oscar for best Cinematography in 1978 and definitely deserves it with image after image of the wild Texas prairie, capturing all of the drama of a sunset against the horizon and the cold, isolated beauty of the early morning dew. If you can overlook a somewhat conventional plot, the cinematography will absolutely amaze you.",4,The plot is a little cliched but the imagery is absolutely outstanding,1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,1071,"['Days', 'Heaven', 'story', 'man', 'named', 'Bill', 'lover', 'Abby', 'kid-sister', 'Linda', 'running', 'away', 'Chicago', 'Texas', 'Panhandle', 'Bill', 'having', 'accidentally', 'murdered', 'foreman', 'steel-mill', 'worked', 'girlfriend', 'Abby', 'kid-sister', 'Linda', 'train', 'Texas', 'become', 'farm', 'workers', 'plot', 'when', 'Bill', 'out', 'farmer', 'working', 'terminally', 'ill', 'attracted', 'Abby', 'Convincing', 'Abby', 'accept', 'farmer', 'advances', 'hope', 'will', 'die', 'farm', 'will', 'be', 'inherited', 'Bill', 'unwittingly', 'motion', 'events', 'lead', 'movies', 'apocalyptic', 'climax', 'subdued', 'ending', 'power', 'movie', 'not', 'plot', 'absolutely', 'majestic', 'images', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'Cinematography', '1978', 'definitely', 'image', 'image', 'wild', 'Texas', 'prairie', 'capturing', 'drama', 'sunset', 'horizon', 'cold', 'isolated', 'beauty', 'early', 'morning', 'dew', 'can', 'overlook', 'somewhat', 'conventional', 'plot', 'cinematography', 'will', 'absolutely', 'amaze']",N/A
