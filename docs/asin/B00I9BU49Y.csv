This is the 1934 version and is better than the color re-make in 1959 (which is good, but not as good). The story is based on the true story of the British poets Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett. Laughton plays her horrible father and the large family includes Maureen O'Sullivan, among many other fine supporting cast members.

1693776,A1OD3BOW1H0NHK,B00I9BU49Y,"Maribeth Brinson ""Hoosier2""","[8, 8]","I couldn't give it five but this film is well worth watching.  Films from this period can have long periods of dialog with no cuts, the story is set up well so by the time the Robert Browning character bursts into the room all energy and positive life, the contrast is stark to the viewer of how confined on all levels her life has been.  The tip off to the father is the reaction of her dog Flash.  Each time the father enters her room, Flash makes for his bed.  It's based on a play and has a play feel to it.  The script could only hint at the fathers true motives, but it's there, especially toward the end and Elizabeth can no longer excuse her father.  No features, just the film.  I think it's overpriced, but it's not going to sell a lot copies, I'm thrilled to finally have it in my Norma Shearer collection.",4,Waited so long for DVD release.,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,817,"['could', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Films', 'period', 'can', 'have', 'long', 'periods', 'dialog', 'cuts', 'story', 'set', 'up', 'well', 'so', 'time', 'Robert', 'Browning', 'character', 'bursts', 'room', 'energy', 'positive', 'life', 'contrast', 'stark', 'viewer', 'how', 'confined', 'levels', 'life', 'been', 'tip', 'father', 'reaction', 'dog', 'Flash', 'time', 'father', 'room', 'Flash', 'bed', 'based', 'play', 'play', 'feel', 'script', 'could', 'only', 'hint', 'fathers', 'true', 'motives', 'there', 'especially', 'end', 'Elizabeth', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'excuse', 'father', 'features', 'just', 'film', 'think', 'overpriced', 'not', 'going', 'sell', 'lot', 'copies', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'finally', 'have', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'collection']",N/A
