Feral woman is found in the woods and kidnapped by a seemingly normal father and husband.  The woman is taken back to the family home, kept in an underground outhouse, and subjected to horrific treatment (by the father and his unruly son) until one day she breaks free and exacts her revenge.  You've seen this movie before in several different forms.  But the last 20 minutes of this movie (the revenge scenes) make the slow-developing plot worth the wait.  The ending is a bit weird and leaves you wondering, but I guess that is become more normal these days.  Works well for those movie goers into gore, female exploitation, and revenge of the woman.

One of the best horror films I saw in 2011, The Woman centers around a lawyer named Christopher Cleek, who discovers a feral woman living in the woods, captures her, and brings her home to his family in order to civilize her for modern society. Of course, the woman turns out to be more than Christopher bargained for, and before long, the family is forced to defend themselves against an unfamiliar enemy with the upper hand. Despite its familiar explorations of gender and human nature, The Woman is an ambitious, unabashedly strange, and ultimately effective thriller that builds tension toward a brutal, no-holds-barred climax.",3,The Woman,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,790,"['Imagine', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'decided', 'remake', '1987', 'comedy', 'Walk', 'Man', 'modern', 'grindhouse', 'thriller', ""'d"", 'basically', 'have', 'recipe', 'Woman', 'One', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'saw', '2011', 'Woman', 'centers', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Christopher', 'Cleek', 'who', 'feral', 'woman', 'living', 'woods', 'home', 'family', 'order', 'civilize', 'modern', 'society', 'course', 'woman', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'Christopher', 'bargained', 'long', 'family', 'forced', 'defend', 'unfamiliar', 'enemy', 'upper', 'hand', 'familiar', 'explorations', 'gender', 'human', 'nature', 'Woman', 'ambitious', 'unabashedly', 'strange', 'ultimately', 'effective', 'thriller', 'tension', 'brutal', 'no-holds-barred', 'climax']",N/A
1502582,AV30RYVPJJJ34,B005SQRYB4,Alexander Stephen Brown,"[2, 3]","The Woman - perhaps the most important horror movie of the year.  Although, people will rush to see this because of the splatterpunk theme, I can assure you the message presented is much more that just civilizing a cannibal.Ok, I'm going to make this part short and sweet and then you go from there.  The acting, directing, effects, etc were beyond amazing.  This movie bleeds, no pun intended, talent and good story telling. Here's the synopsis of the movie.  Big time law official kidnaps a cannibal in the woods and tries to torture her into being civilized, however, although this is his excuse, he's just looking for a reason to brutalize women besides his wife and pregnant teenage daughter, which suggestively the movie insinuates that he is the father of his daughters unborn fetus.... Incest rape is only indicated here, not shown.Here's where I'm going to ramble. The mother/wife of the family is a personification of the ""1950's Good Wife"" image where she doesn't doubt or question her husband, and if she does she gets a slap in the face.  This is further indicated as her character is mostly found in the kitchen, tending to the children, cleaning house, and grocery shopping. She is the Bette Crocker mold of Stepford perfection.  Although she is really dying inside from the abuse that her husband has inflicted on her, her daughters, and the cannibal woman, her refusal to help herself, or anyother female, shows that she has accepted her role.The cannibal AKA The Woman on the other hand is the opposite. The cannibal is a personification of the liberated female, one that can walk on her own, provide on her own, and defend herself.  Even through all of the abuse, she not once bows to the man figure, she simply bides her time.  When the two time periods interact, you can tell by body language that the liberated female is asking the repressed female for help.  Even though the repressed wife has the opportunity to help, she doesn't, as she is dominated by her husband.SPOLIERSWhen the cannibal is released, she kills the wife/mother because she allowed her children/herself and the cannibal to undergo unspeakable abuse without ever attempting defense.  Therefore the ""1950's Good Wife"" figure is just as guilty as the villain since she never tried to help anyone.The cannibal kills her captor and his son, because his son is just as twisted as he is.  By the way, the perversities and sadism of the son is shown frequently in the movie and when the son's disturbing behavior is noted to the father, he practically pats the boy on the head and says, ""Boys will be boys."" This shows how abusive fathers try to condition their boys to be the same as them. The liberated female killing father and son indicates, in order to advance forward we have to eliminate the repressed way of living no matter how young or old.Finally, the scene where the daughters are rescued by the cannibal is a representation of females leaving behind the 1950's women's slavery trend and walking into liberation.  However, in order to atchieve this, they have to give up all material items, the Bette Crocker world, so they can live in a world free of repression. This brings me to note, the ending is simple but powerful.",5,"Blood, Gore, Politics and more",1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,3219,"['Woman', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'horror', 'movie', 'year', 'people', 'will', 'rush', 'see', 'splatterpunk', 'theme', 'can', 'assure', 'message', 'presented', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'civilizing', 'cannibal.Ok', ""'m"", 'going', 'make', 'part', 'short', 'sweet', 'then', 'go', 'there', 'acting', 'directing', 'effects', 'etc', 'were', 'amazing', 'movie', 'pun', 'intended', 'talent', 'good', 'story', 'telling', 'Here', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'Big', 'time', 'law', 'official', 'cannibal', 'woods', 'tries', 'torture', 'being', 'civilized', 'however', 'excuse', 'just', 'looking', 'reason', 'brutalize', 'women', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'suggestively', 'movie', 'father', 'daughters', 'unborn', 'fetus', 'Incest', 'rape', 'only', 'indicated', 'here', 'not', 'where', ""'m"", 'going', 'ramble', 'mother/wife', 'family', 'personification', '1950', 'Good', 'Wife', 'image', 'where', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'question', 'husband', 'slap', 'face', 'further', 'indicated', 'character', 'mostly', 'found', 'kitchen', 'tending', 'children', 'cleaning', 'house', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'Bette', 'Crocker', 'mold', 'Stepford', 'perfection', 'really', 'dying', 'abuse', 'husband', 'inflicted', 'daughters', 'cannibal', 'woman', 'refusal', 'help', 'anyother', 'female', 'accepted', 'role.The', 'cannibal', 'AKA', 'Woman', 'other', 'hand', 'opposite', 'cannibal', 'personification', 'liberated', 'female', 'one', 'can', 'walk', 'own', 'provide', 'own', 'defend', 'Even', 'abuse', 'not', 'once', 'man', 'figure', 'simply', 'time', 'When', 'two', 'time', 'periods', 'interact', 'can', 'tell', 'body', 'language', 'liberated', 'female', 'asking', 'repressed', 'female', 'help', 'Even', 'repressed', 'wife', 'opportunity', 'help', ""n't"", 'dominated', 'husband.SPOLIERSWhen', 'cannibal', 'released', 'wife/mother', 'allowed', 'children/herself', 'cannibal', 'undergo', 'unspeakable', 'abuse', 'ever', 'attempting', 'defense', 'Therefore', '1950', 'Good', 'Wife', 'figure', 'just', 'as', 'guilty', 'villain', 'never', 'tried', 'help', 'anyone.The', 'cannibal', 'kills', 'captor', 'son', 'son', 'just', 'as', 'twisted', 'way', 'perversities', 'sadism', 'son', 'shown', 'frequently', 'movie', 'when', 'son', 'disturbing', 'behavior', 'noted', 'father', 'practically', 'boy', 'head', 'Boys', 'will', 'be', 'boys', 'how', 'abusive', 'fathers', 'try', 'condition', 'boys', 'be', 'same', 'liberated', 'female', 'killing', 'father', 'son', 'indicates', 'order', 'advance', 'forward', 'have', 'eliminate', 'repressed', 'way', 'living', 'matter', 'how', 'young', 'old.Finally', 'scene', 'where', 'daughters', 'are', 'rescued', 'cannibal', 'representation', 'females', 'leaving', '1950', 'women', 'slavery', 'trend', 'walking', 'liberation', 'However', 'order', 'atchieve', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'material', 'items', 'Bette', 'Crocker', 'world', 'can', 'live', 'world', 'free', 'repression', 'note', 'ending', 'simple', 'powerful']",N/A

But at a certain point, when the viewer is most certainly ready, the plot takes off and things get resolved, if you want to call it that.It's an interesting movie, and although I had to turn away during a few scenes, I found it entertaining and a tad thought provoking. But bear in mind that I like horror films.  Oh, it's not a pschological thriller or Citizen Kane type of movie. It's not ""deep.""

Or so it would seem... Offensive, appalling, and dangerous are just three of the terms that could accurately be used to describe Lucky McKee's exploitative shocker THE WOMAN, a film conceived from the novel that he co-wrote with critically-acclaimed author Jack Ketchum as a follow-up to The Offspring.Where the violence and torture in THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is often condoned for its connections to True Crime, and the movie adaptation of THE OFFSPRING is typically shrugged away as being Survivalist trash, there is something profoundly disturbing in McKee's handling of THE WOMAN that makes it such a harrowing viewing experience. McKee's sharp, cynical humor finds its way back in to every scene, but given the difficulty of the subject matter, the audience simply is not prepared to use laughter as a safety net for the horror. It is clear, from the very brginning, that McKee is toying with his audiences, using bright, cheerful colors and an upbeat Indie score to purely contradict the dark overriding themes. The constant disruption of mood only works to amplify the director's twisted sense of humor. He never asks us to overlook the horrifying impact of the images or events on screen, he is simply highlighting them for their inherent absurdity. The torture, rape, and abuse found within the film are meant to be as disgusting and enraging as perceived in order to drive out an emotional response in the viewer. This is consistent with the gut-wrenching reactions to other ground-breaking Horror entries like THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, or more recently, MARTYRS and DEADGIRL. THE WOMAN also returns us to the all-too-familiar theme of ""Civilization Versus Savagery,"" which has been frequented by directors like Wes Craven and Sam Peckinpah in their films THE HILLS HAVE EYES and STRAW DOGS.The cast is certainly not to be forgotten beneath McKee's choices as a director. Each of these actors and actresses are equally responsible for carrying out the unbearable acts on screen without so much as a wink to the audience. Sean Bridgers plays Chris Cleek as if he were Ted Bundy. Calm, cool, and collected on the surface, but hiding a soul of absolute evil. His wife and children are undeniably oppressed, with both Angela Bettis and Lauren Ashley Carter reaching deep in to the dark recesses of the mind to find where abused women go to shelter themselves. They are utterly believable on screen. Their son Brian, played by Zach Rand, has inherited his father's sociopathic tendencies through constant psychological abuse as well. We pity him for becoming a victim of both nature and nurture. Interestingly enough, ""The Woman"" for which the film was named is but a side character, a catalyst used to reveal Chris as the film's true villain. He is infinitely more frightening than his new ""houseguest.""THE WOMAN is not for all audiences. It is upsetting and morally questionable, but it is extremely effective in achieving its desired goals. Fans of Lucky McKee's work will find this to be his darkest project to date, but one that strictly keeps in line with the director's peculiar style and sensibilities.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,The Woman,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,3355,"['Chris', 'Cleek', 'feral', 'woman', 'living', 'forests', 'home', 'capture', 'lock', 'away', 'family', 'cellar', 'so', 'can', 'begin', 'domesticate', 'would', 'seem', 'Offensive', 'appalling', 'dangerous', 'are', 'just', 'three', 'terms', 'could', 'accurately', 'be', 'used', 'describe', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'exploitative', 'shocker', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'film', 'conceived', 'novel', 'co-wrote', 'critically-acclaimed', 'author', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'follow-up', 'Offspring.Where', 'violence', 'torture', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'NEXT', 'DOOR', 'often', 'condoned', 'connections', 'True', 'Crime', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'THE', 'OFFSPRING', 'typically', 'shrugged', 'away', 'being', 'Survivalist', 'trash', 'something', 'profoundly', 'disturbing', 'McKee', 'handling', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'such', 'harrowing', 'viewing', 'experience', 'McKee', 'sharp', 'cynical', 'humor', 'way', 'back', 'scene', 'given', 'difficulty', 'subject', 'matter', 'audience', 'simply', 'not', 'prepared', 'use', 'laughter', 'safety', 'net', 'horror', 'clear', 'very', 'brginning', 'McKee', 'toying', 'audiences', 'using', 'bright', 'cheerful', 'colors', 'upbeat', 'Indie', 'score', 'purely', 'contradict', 'dark', 'overriding', 'themes', 'constant', 'disruption', 'mood', 'only', 'amplify', 'director', 'twisted', 'sense', 'humor', 'never', 'overlook', 'horrifying', 'impact', 'images', 'events', 'screen', 'simply', 'highlighting', 'inherent', 'absurdity', 'torture', 'rape', 'abuse', 'found', 'film', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'disgusting', 'enraging', 'perceived', 'order', 'drive', 'out', 'emotional', 'response', 'viewer', 'consistent', 'gut-wrenching', 'reactions', 'other', 'ground-breaking', 'Horror', 'entries', 'LAST', 'HOUSE', 'ON', 'LEFT', 'SPIT', 'YOUR', 'GRAVE', 'more', 'recently', 'MARTYRS', 'DEADGIRL', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'also', 'all-too-familiar', 'theme', 'Civilization', 'Versus', 'Savagery', 'been', 'frequented', 'directors', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'films', 'THE', 'HILLS', 'HAVE', 'EYES', 'STRAW', 'DOGS.The', 'cast', 'certainly', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'McKee', 'choices', 'director', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'equally', 'responsible', 'carrying', 'out', 'unbearable', 'acts', 'screen', 'so', 'much', 'wink', 'audience', 'Sean', 'Bridgers', 'Chris', 'Cleek', 'were', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'Calm', 'cool', 'collected', 'surface', 'hiding', 'soul', 'absolute', 'evil', 'wife', 'children', 'are', 'undeniably', 'oppressed', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'Lauren', 'Ashley', 'Carter', 'reaching', 'deep', 'dark', 'recesses', 'mind', 'find', 'where', 'abused', 'women', 'go', 'shelter', 'are', 'utterly', 'believable', 'screen', 'son', 'Brian', 'played', 'Zach', 'Rand', 'inherited', 'father', 'sociopathic', 'tendencies', 'constant', 'psychological', 'abuse', 'well', 'pity', 'becoming', 'victim', 'nature', 'nurture', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Woman', 'film', 'was', 'named', 'side', 'character', 'catalyst', 'used', 'reveal', 'Chris', 'film', 'true', 'villain', 'infinitely', 'more', 'frightening', 'new', 'houseguest', 'WOMAN', 'not', 'audiences', 'upsetting', 'morally', 'questionable', 'extremely', 'effective', 'achieving', 'desired', 'goals', 'Fans', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'work', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'darkest', 'project', 'date', 'one', 'strictly', 'line', 'director', 'peculiar', 'style', 'sensibilities.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

The story is about this creep and woman-hater Chris Cleek who finds a wild woman in the woods, captures her and shackles her up in his cellar.  He's out of his mind and doesn't try to hide the woman - so he introduces his family to her and claims that he's taken her so they can ""help"" the woman and ""civilize"" her.  His brand of helping her includes rape and torture.  Equally sadistic is his mean-spirited son who goes along with whatever his dad has in store.  The woman impacts different family members in different ways - Chris' submissive and out-of-it wife goes along with Chris but finally reaches the point of being done with his cruel ways; daughter Peg who may be pregnant protects the wild woman and feels horrible for all the tortures she is enduring; the youngest daughter seems as if she doesn't fully understand the situation but comforts the wild woman with music and generally takes a liking to her.  When a well-meaning teacher visits the family to discuss the possibility that daughter Peg might be pregnant, the movie crescendos into a strange finale including the discovery of another eyeless wild woman who thinks she's a dog, cannibalism and some gory deaths.  To say this movie is weird is an understatement.  Not much scares me but admittedly the hissing, black-toothed wild woman with a look of death in her eye was so convincing I got the chills.  I'm not sure if they were trying to hint that Chris had also had incestual relations with his daughter and that's why she was pregnant, but it seemed that's what the movie was trying to lean towards.  Oddly enough Chris Cleek reminded me of George W Bush or at least that's what I kept thinking.  I'm not sure what I got out of this movie and the ending seems to leave some guesswork.  The person who played The Woman was excellent in her role and really nailed the primal requirements to be such a person.  I can't say this is a great movie - it's just very different and you will stay hooked to it to see exactly what's going to happen - especially when the movie escalates.  I guess I might watch it one more time to get over the initial shock of 'what the heck did I just see' but to me the story follows the lines of many of those torture type movies with a small twist.  Watch it if you want to see a horror movie about a cave woman who is actually quite scary and you want to see a whole bunch of strange crap going on.

It fits in comfortably  with the few books I've read by Jack Ketchum, or movies I've seen based on his books.Here's the scoop. Chris Cleek is a lawyer and runs his house with an iron fist. He's misogynist, a true male chauvinist pig, and is teaching his son to be the same. While out hunting he comes across a feral woman living in a cave. He captures her, imprisons her and is determined to ""civilize"" her. This is an oversimplification but pretty much everything else in the movie is driven by this.This is some rough stuff. Cleek is an ugly individual and it hurts to see the sweet, upright exterior he shows the world juxtaposed with the disgusting individual he really is. The way he treats his wife and older daughter killed me. They're terrified of him. And that he's passing these traits down to his son is saddening. Then there's the way he treats ""The Woman."" Not to spoil, but he shows her not one iota of kindness. The ending will slay you. Certain things you want to happen do happen, but there's is much unexpected as well and it goes down rough. It was all very surprising.Jack Ketchum helped write the script so my guess is it sticks close to the novel. The performances were mostly very good. The production was as good as it had to be and the directing worked well. I had issues with some of the soundtrack and sound mixing. I had to turn the volume way down in some scenes. And, as others have mentioned, the Woman's shaved legs and armpits didn't make sense, which is odd given how fierce the vision is in this movie. But, that aside, this is well worth a look.

1502601,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B005SQRYB4,I'm Right,"[10, 20]","Spoilers blah blah blahLet's just jump in shall we? The story is a guy and his son find a feral woman living in the backwoods and shoot/kidnap her, and decide to hold her in their basement, in order to 'civilize' her; pretty interesting so far no? The women in the household are more than a little concerned about this new situation but the dad is headstrong in his 'mission' while the son is eagerly tagging along.Let's just get the good aspects of this film out of the way, the production values are excellent, the cinematography, the music, the pacing of the film, it's all very well made. The acting is good but nothing special and the design of the woman is pretty gritty, which was nice.This sounds like a pretty good horror movie, but here's where the story gets royally stupid. So obviously we find out that the feral woman isn't the REAL monster here, it's the men of the family, aparently they're still living in a super patriarchal mindset and all woman are dumb servants that need to be beaten all the time. Ok I guess, but why is the father like this? Oh we don't know and we're just supposed to accept that he's bad without any reason or sign? ZOMG 5 STAR MOVIE ALL THE WAY, DEAR LORD THERE JUST AREN'T ENOUGH STARS TO THROW AT THIS MOVIE IT'S TOOO GOOD! No.The men are all violent wife beating rapists, and all the woman are nothing more than quiet subservient doormats. The Woman is storywise that black and white, men r bad, women r good lols. There is no depth, logic, or subtelty at all in this movie, we're just shown that men are horrible through shock value. And it's not just the father/son either, the daughter is shown at school and her male classmates are also misogynistic pigs, so really all men are apparently horrible people in this movie's universe. If we apply this same black and white assumption that a group of people are evil to be anything other than white men, it would be labeled offensive and stupid, but because it's against white men it's not just ok, it's critically acclaimed since it's politically correct! Give me a break...For example there's a scene where the son sneaks into the cellar and sexually tortures the feral captive, but when the mom who found out tells the dad, he just turns around and beats her for thinking the son's sick in the head. If you're going to show people get abused there has to be some sort of reason behind it, but here we get no reason. Are we just watching torture porn here? I mean I get that there are sick people in real life who abuse their family like this, but in this movie's universe all men are violent women-hating rapists without any sort of reason, background, or logic; there is no grey morality, nothing to question or think about here, men are simply monstrous pigs, that's all you need to know. Now please continue with the applause and 5 star reviews.This would be fine if this was just a subplot to a bigger story going on and the psychopathic father was just a blatant cariacture of how people shouldn't act, but the movie centers around his poorly written character, and that's the whole movie here is watching him beat women up. There's zero subtlety, zero character development, and zero entertainment value, it's just a director that likes to slap you in the face with a blatant social commentary that cheaply capitalizes on white man's guilt.",1,Worst movie of 2011,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,3344,"['Spoilers', 'blah', 'blah', 'blahLet', 'just', 'jump', 'shall', 'story', 'guy', 'son', 'find', 'feral', 'woman', 'living', 'backwoods', 'shoot/kidnap', 'decide', 'hold', 'basement', 'order', ""'civilize"", 'pretty', 'interesting', 'so', 'far', 'women', 'household', 'are', 'more', 'little', 'concerned', 'new', 'situation', 'dad', 'headstrong', ""'mission"", 'son', 'eagerly', 'tagging', 'along.Let', 'just', 'get', 'good', 'aspects', 'film', 'way', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'music', 'pacing', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'acting', 'good', 'nothing', 'special', 'design', 'woman', 'pretty', 'gritty', 'was', 'nice.This', 'sounds', 'pretty', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'here', 'where', 'story', 'royally', 'stupid', 'So', 'obviously', 'find', 'out', 'feral', 'woman', ""n't"", 'REAL', 'monster', 'here', 'men', 'family', 'aparently', ""'re"", 'still', 'living', 'super', 'patriarchal', 'mindset', 'woman', 'are', 'dumb', 'servants', 'need', 'be', 'beaten', 'time', 'guess', 'why', 'father', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'re"", 'just', 'supposed', 'accept', 'bad', 'reason', 'sign', 'ZOMG', '5', 'STAR', 'MOVIE', 'ALL', 'THE', 'WAY', 'DEAR', 'LORD', 'THERE', 'JUST', 'ARE', ""N'T"", 'ENOUGH', 'STARS', 'TO', 'THROW', 'AT', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'IT', 'TOOO', 'GOOD', 'No.The', 'men', 'are', 'violent', 'wife', 'beating', 'rapists', 'woman', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'quiet', 'subservient', 'doormats', 'Woman', 'storywise', 'black', 'white', 'men', 'r', 'bad', 'women', 'r', 'good', 'lols', 'depth', 'logic', 'subtelty', 'movie', ""'re"", 'just', 'shown', 'men', 'are', 'horrible', 'shock', 'value', 'not', 'just', 'father/son', 'daughter', 'shown', 'school', 'male', 'classmates', 'are', 'also', 'misogynistic', 'pigs', 'so', 'really', 'men', 'are', 'apparently', 'horrible', 'people', 'movie', 'universe', 'apply', 'same', 'black', 'white', 'assumption', 'group', 'people', 'are', 'evil', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'white', 'men', 'would', 'be', 'labeled', 'offensive', 'stupid', 'white', 'men', 'not', 'just', 'ok', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'politically', 'correct', 'Give', 'break', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'son', 'cellar', 'sexually', 'feral', 'captive', 'when', 'mom', 'who', 'found', 'out', 'dad', 'just', 'around', 'thinking', 'son', 'sick', 'head', ""'re"", 'going', 'show', 'people', 'get', 'abused', 'there', 'be', 'sort', 'reason', 'here', 'get', 'reason', 'Are', 'just', 'watching', 'torture', 'porn', 'here', 'mean', 'get', 'are', 'sick', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'who', 'abuse', 'family', 'movie', 'universe', 'men', 'are', 'violent', 'women-hating', 'rapists', 'sort', 'reason', 'background', 'logic', 'grey', 'morality', 'nothing', 'question', 'think', 'here', 'men', 'are', 'simply', 'monstrous', 'pigs', 'need', 'know', 'Now', 'please', 'continue', 'applause', '5', 'star', 'reviews.This', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'was', 'just', 'subplot', 'bigger', 'story', 'going', 'psychopathic', 'father', 'was', 'just', 'blatant', 'cariacture', 'how', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'act', 'movie', 'centers', 'poorly', 'written', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'here', 'watching', 'beat', 'women', 'up', 'zero', 'subtlety', 'zero', 'character', 'development', 'zero', 'entertainment', 'value', 'just', 'director', 'slap', 'face', 'blatant', 'social', 'commentary', 'capitalizes', 'white', 'man', 'guilt']",N/A

Chris brings her home and makes her a ""project"" for the family, as they try to civilize the beastly women; but, who's really the one that needs to be civilized? The Woman is a disturbing and haunting film.The story in this film will be taken in differently by different people, of course. Some will take it at face value and see a brutal, misogynistic tale; some may even see it as a man-hating film that blatantly makes all men evil; others will see it ""nature vs. nurture"" type of tale where you'll question who the real monster is and why. For example, there is a lot of domestic abuse in this film where the Chris beats his wife and scenes where he takes advantage of ""the Woman""; this will likely, and rightfully, offend viewers. Then you witness scenes where you realize these sinister traits are being passed down to the son- scenes that show the kid become more and more like his devilish father; the ending will also support the ""who is the real monster"" concept, although I won't spoil it. The final sequence, although though-provoking and having it add a wicked twist, felt a bit rushed and unrealistic; although the film is already violent enough, the ending takes it to ridiculous levels that felt out of place. Also, the film has little bits of dark humor spread throughout, using witty dialogue and music. The acting was great, the special effects were great, and it had a great, unique choice of music.Overall, The Woman is a brutal and disturbing film; you may be left offended, but if you can ultimately understand the message it tries to convey it shouldn't be a significant issue.

Szilagy ""Joe Szilagy""","[2, 4]","(Semi 'SPOILER' Alert).....Well, except for the pop punk, (or whatever), 'rock' in the background, which did not fit whatsoever in the opening scene, as well as many other places, this movie is captivating, and difficult to take your eyes off of.It starts out with 'the woman' wondering through a stream in search of food and shelter in the forest, trying to take care of a cut or something on her side with mud. Not too far a way, a family lives out in the country- a lawyer, his obedient wife, troubled teenage daughter, 12 or 13 year-old unhappy son, and a little girl.One day while hunting in the woods, the lawyer spots the wild girl, and spies on her while washing herself in the stream, admiring her semi nakedness. He then hatches a plan to capture her, which he eventually does.Strangely enough, his entire family, (somewhat reluctantly) go along with his idea of keeping her chained up in the basement part of their barn!All of this can only add up to a potentially fascinating story of how the man attempts to tame this wild person, and it does begin to fascinate, but soon things start to contradict each other a little.For example, though domineering at first, the man and his family get along fairly well, and they seem to tolerate his ways- likely because he seems to be the one making all the money. However, for some inexplicable reason, he starts to get physically and verbally abusive here and there, whereas he didn't seem to before. Also, his intentions at first seem to be to break the girl out of her wild ways, and educate her, but once he sees her beautiful naked body cleaned off, he starts to get other ideas. Toward's the end of the movie, he completely flips and gets himself into more trouble than he could possibly get out of, again for no logical reason! His son too, suddenly sides with his dad, (and suddenly adopts his dad's weird ideas), which doesn't quite add up.Then, even more incredibly, what could have developed into something fascinating, denigrates into just another flesh-eating 'zombie-like' movie during the last fifteen minutes, replete with the sudden appearance of a goofy wild zombie boy barking and acting silly!! Except for that, and a lot of the music, this could have turned into something really exceptional! It's almost as though the people behind the film suddenly ran out of ideas and thought, ""uhm, what'll we do now?!"" And someone responded with, ""I know!

Perhaps this woman looking for a career change? Why else would she behave so ludicrously? Surely she would be fired, and possibly have legal action taken against her. Guess, in the frenzy to express her concern, she overlooked that.  And I guess the notion that perhaps the reason for the change in the girl's demeanor is the result of dysfunction at home?

Polly, Sean and Angela deserve better than this crapfest. fyi nothing happens until the last 10 minutes of the movie. yep seriously. when it does, its not very climactic at all, or even remotely worth the boredom that led up to it. very predictable and just boring. another director would have been a better choice. great idea for a movie, bad choice in director. check out Kevin Smith's Red State, i saw the devil, house of 1000 corpses, tucker and dale or the reef. these films have more shock and talent than this turd.",2,"great ideas, very poorly executed",1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,2262,"['only', 'reason', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'polly', 'mcintosh', 'great', 'actress', 'powerful', 'performance', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'angela', 'bettis', 'sean', 'bridgers', 'were', 'good', 'too', 'nothing', 'special', 'May', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'just', 'stuck', 'great', 'acting', 'angela', 'bettis', 'huge', 'empathy', 'so', 'fourth', 'lucky', 'mckee', 'really', 'one', 'hit', 'wonder', 'follow', 'ups', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'boring', 'poorly', 'executed', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'film', 'always', 'terrible', 'actress/actor', 'scene', 'movies', 'case', 'was', 'son', 'teacher', 'HORRIBLE', 'acting', 'music', 'just', 'AWFUL', 'not', 'fit', 'film', 'just', 'when', 'feel', 'getting', 'sucked', 'MTV', 'alternative', 'video', 'music', 'just', 'sucks', 'FOREVER', 'i', 'cant', 'stand', 'when', 'director', 'listen', 'idea', 'cool', 'music', 'annoying', 'really', 'poor', 'excuse', 'actually', 'compose', 'score', 'film', 'bad', 'acting', 'music', 'really', 'are', '2', 'things', 'drag', 'film', 'down', 'woods', 'sick', 'girl', 'just', 'can', 'never', 'live', 'up', 'May', 'i', 'think', 'when', 'previews', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'people', 'walked', 'out', 'im', 'really', 'thinking', 'wasnt', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'stupid', 'music', 'one', 'second', 'have', 'movie', 'then', 'have', 'music', 'video', 'fade', 'in/out', 'fluff', 'indie', 'directors', 'try', 'go', 'i', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', '3', 'flops', 'lucky', 'im', 'done', 'huge', 'horror', 'fan', 'please', 'rent', 'buy', 'time', 'lucky', 'mckee', 'tries', 'get', 'better', 'just', 'things', 'worse', 'college', 'movie', 'attitude', 'poor', 'choice', 'supporting', 'actor', 'roles', 'supposed', 'grow', 'not', 'take', 'steps', 'back', 'Polly', 'Sean', 'Angela', 'deserve', 'better', 'crapfest', 'fyi', 'nothing', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'seriously', 'when', 'not', 'very', 'climactic', 'even', 'remotely', 'boredom', 'led', 'up', 'very', 'predictable', 'just', 'boring', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'great', 'idea', 'movie', 'bad', 'choice', 'director', 'check', 'out', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Red', 'State', 'i', 'saw', 'devil', 'house', '1000', 'corpses', 'tucker', 'dale', 'reef', 'films', 'have', 'more', 'shock', 'talent', 'turd']",N/A

Red was very well done and Off Spring (the sequel to Offseason) was good. The Woman is better. Psychological terror at its best.Pollyanna McIntosh is amazing as the feral woman. My wife, a costumer, immediately noticed her walk: like a beast, not a woman (or man). Her full-body makeup should earn an Oscar, as well as her acting. Angela Bettis, as the broken-down wife, was also outstanding, and Sean Bridgers, as her sadistic, psychotic husband, had just the right amount of quiet lunacy to carry off the role. It's good to see Sean in a starring role; he's worked hard for it.The only complaint I had was that some of the music was too LOUD (it distracted form the script) and some of the lyrics had no relation to the action. I've always believed the music should further the action, or strengthen it (The Big Chill).There was one very gross moment early, that made my wife turn away, but that I thought was the sexiest, most sensual, eating scene since Tom Jones.

1502627,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005SQRYB4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","The Woman (Lucky McKee, 2011)What almost everyone knows about The Woman who knows anything about The Woman is that is has caused, and continues to cause, a firestorm of debate in the horror community as to whether it is meant as a feminist film or a misogynist one. (I lack an understanding of why this debate exists, given Lucky McKee's previous filmography; everything he has done has had a marked feminist streak.) I am unsure how many of the people involved in this debate have actually sat down and watched the silly thing, the third installment in a series that began with Jack Ketchum's novels Off Season and Off Spring, both of which have already been filmed (both by other directors, and both not nearly as well as this). It's not McKee's best work&#8212;in fact, in McKee's entire filmography, including Red (for which he received no credit), I ended up rating The Woman the lowest&#8212;but that does not mean it is not a good film, nor that you should not see it as long as you have the stomach for it; Lucky McKee bringing his C game to the table is still better than about 90% of dedicated horror hacks bringing their A games, and McKee has a light touch with savagery compared to a number of other recent enfants terribles (Eli Roth, anyone?), so that while he's making a film that is just as nasty as the ones being made by those guys&#8212;even more, in many ways, just as it was in Sick Girl&#8212;McKee is good about leaving things just enough offscreen to trick you into thinking you maybe saw a lot more nastiness than you did. That's an impressive trick to pull off. It also has the unfortunate side effect of fueling those debates, but you can't have everything.First off: if you have not seen Off Season and Off Spring yet (or, preferably, read the novels), go on, we will wait. This is not a stand-alone film in any way, even if those other pieces were directed by other folks; I think at least part of the debate is fueled by those who are unaware of the backstory here. The titular, and unnamed, Woman (Exam's Polyanna McIntosh) is the last surviving member of the cannibal clan who have been roaming the New England coast for decades, and whom we first met in those previous works. Without the family system in place, she is confused and somewhat weakened (think the teen protagonists of We Are What We Are, but far more savage), and she is eventually captured by Chris Cleek (Nell's Sean Bridgers), a backwoods lawyer with a thoroughly cracked family, delusions of grandeur, and a mean streak as wide as the Hudson. Originally, the Woman's presence, and Cleek's intent to &#8220;civilize&#8221; her (if you've got comparisons in your head to Bub in Day of the Dead and Ketchum's own The Girl Next Door, you're right on target), only affect Cleek himself, but that particular disease grows to infect the rest of the family, as sure as you can imagine, from Belle (McKee regular Angela Bettis)'s weird fascination with her to Brian (Ghoul's Zach Rand)'s sexual attraction. (According to IMDB's trivia, there was an entire subplot excised from the film about Peggy, Cleek's wife&#8212;and if you haven't read the novel, that alone may well be reason enough to seek it out, because that feels missing from this movie.)The thing is, it's tough to get into the whole feminist/misogynist debate without revealing every major spoiler for the film, because that question is not answerable until the last sequence, but it seemed to me obvious once you got there&#8212;even if you're not already familiar with McKee's work (and this is not a spoiler alert: Lucky McKee wouldn't touch a misogynist project with a ten-foot pole, and nor would Angela Bettis, judging by both's past records). Putting that aside, how's the rest of the movie, Mrs. Lincoln? Lucky McKee has, traditionally, excelled at one thing (among many others): taking B-list and character actors and getting A-list performances out of them. The Woman is no different in that regard; you have never heard of most of these people, though in some cases you should have (you've never seen Exam? Go. Now.), and you will exit this movie wondering why. McKee is also very good at knowing where to stick a camera for maximum effect and minimum special effects. Normally, in his movies, this leads to perhaps lighter ratings (and lower budgets), since you rarely see as much nastiness as your brain believes you are, but there was no way this one was getting around a hard R. (To McKee's credit, had he taken the Bill Zebub show-everything route, this might not have even managed an NC-17.) Whether you buy into the misogyny talk or not, there is no denying that certain pieces of this film are difficult viewing, and it would be remiss of me to not add that at least one scene in the film is seriously triggering. (Depending on your particular neurosis, hell, the whole film may be triggering.) Approach with caution, but if you are a Lucky McKee fan, still approach. And if you are not already a Lucky McKee fan, go get your hands on May and Red and become one before watching this. *** ",4,Standing rib roast.,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,5064,"['Woman', 'Lucky',

While not entirely without cause (but... pretty much entirely), I cannot fathom why this stands out on so many occassions as a film held in high critical regard...  the acting was laughable at best, the characters were completely unbelievable along with the script and casting decisions all together to think of it (the daughter's ""concerned"" teacher was completely misplaced and utterly unconvincing as a valid part of our lineup.) Bummer, I was really looking forward to this as I am a HUGE Jack Ketchum fan and had heard such great things.  Worst of all was the films horrendous choice of score.  The soundtrack was a collection of pop/garage/emo/grunge/teen-angst-ridden rock songs that not only failed to convey any emotional impact toward the experience but tended to overwhelm it in a very distracting way...

Her legs look pretty darn good for a person who has lived outdoors their entire life, not one scrape,scar, or even hair on the legs...and her armpits are shaved!Sean Bridgers plays Chris Cleek, an unlikeable man of wealth.  He has a mousey wife (Angela Bettis), a teen daughter, a son who has trouble with his free throws and a young daughter who likes to kiss boys to the horror of her mother. Sean Bridgers orders his family around who pretty much obey him, like zombies, without question.He captures the wild woman, and rather than turn her over to the authorities, he chains her up in their basement/shed. He is very open about it and shows her to his family who are completely dumbfounded. Chris Cleek rules the roost and doesn't like to be questioned. He reminds me of a creepy Will Ferrell. Their task is to civilize the woman, a woman who wants no master.The two older children Peg and Brian are portrayed as abnormally reclusive self imposed social outcasts, signs of an abnormal home life. We know this is true because of the lame indie music soundtrack that plays when they are on screen by themselves. Having a scantily clad female chained up around a teen boy brings about some natural curiosity tendencies.The wife and older daughter feel like a prisoner, like the feral woman who symbolizes their imprisonment. Sean Bridges symbolizes the ""system"" which imprisons women. There are scenes showing violence to women that were hard to watch, even though we don't see the actual strikes, we see the arm movement and hear the blows.The movie starts semi-normal, goes to odd, then downright weird as Sean Bridges fights to be the master of his world filled with rebellious women. Sean's son sides with him to give us the full symbolism of the battle of the sexes with men being aggressive controlling rapists and women the victim.Many of the actors in this film are new to the industry.

1502633,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B005SQRYB4,titania86,"[0, 0]","** This review contains spoilers. **Chris Cleek is a seemingly normal family man and lawyer. His family seems perfect in every way with a loving wife, a successful son, and two obedient daughters. One day when hunting, he finds a feral, cannibalistic woman bathing in a lake. After forcing his family to prepare a space for her in the cellar, he captures her to civilize her and save her from her savage ways. His perfect facade crumbles as he ""educates"" the woman and the sick person inside emerges. With his perfection, the family's veneer also falls away, exposing his son's violent tendencies, his daughter's pregnancy, and his wife's complacency despite her anger and her abject horror at his actions. Who will be victorious: the savage woman or the civilized man? Who is the more monstrous?I heard about The Woman during last year's Women in Horror Month and wasn't able to watch it until very recently. I expected to like it, but I was blown away by the film. I absolutely loved it especially because of the wonderful performances of the actors and the underlying message. Chris Cleek is a very creepy character. Gleefully sadistic, he is magnetic and repellent at the same time. He acts as the ideal patriarch of the ideal nuclear family who just happens to be insane, ruling his family with an iron fist. All the women in his life are cowed and fearful as a result of his mentality that women are inherently inferior to men, except for his youngest daughter. His wife, Belle, ignores his abuse to the detriment of her children and his daughter, Peggy, escapes into her music and books to cope with her pregnancy (most likely the product of incest). Even the women and girls seen in passing in their neighborhood are victimized and abused by men outside of the Cleek family, showing that this isn't an isolated incident. His son, Brian, on the other hand, is being groomed to be exactly like him. The process proved to be successful with his disturbing, budding serial killer behavior.Based on this view of the family and the brutal treatment of the Woman, it's easy to just assume that it's propagating misogyny. At its core, The Woman examines women's roles in society and views women in a much more favorable light than it appears. The Woman is a strong character untouched by the influences of civilization. When faced with Chris, she is the only woman to fight back. After continued abuse and the fact that Chris wields superior weapons, the Woman backs down, but is never fully controlled. The minute she is released and catches Chris off guard, she kills him and his son brutally. This shows that misogyny and the idea of women as the weaker sex are conventions of society and not inherently true. Belle is the first person killed after she is released. Many people are upset by this because they feel sorry for her as a victim of her husband. However, I feel it was justified because she allowed her children to be abused and warped by her husband. By doing that, she is just as guilty as Chris, if not more so. She could have left with her kids or called the police long ago and she chose not to, allowing the abuse to continue for years. Also, Chris Cleek is shown to be more brutal and less civilized than the Woman, the only living member of a savage and cannibalistic tribe. His family dynamic calls into question the traditional patriarchal family unit, proving that nostalgia for the past is supporting this dynamic in reality and perpetuating abuse. The world that surrounds these characters supports misogyny as a part of everyday life, with the only exception being Peggy's math teacher, Miss Hindle. This aspect is a commentary on the atmosphere in our own society and how we are numb or blinded to the misogyny we are bombarded with every day.The Woman is a commentary on how women are treated in our society in the present and the past. The film had a few surprising twists and turns, including showing Chris to be way more depraved than I thought, which is saying a lot. The ambiguous ending leaves just enough to the imagination and also leaves the story open for another installment. I really like this film and hope Lucky McKee and Jack Ketchum work together on other projects in the future. I would recommend this to people looking for a challenging, thought provoking, and (at times) difficult to watch film.",5,A formidable collaboration that scrutinizes our society,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,4343,"['**', 'review', 'spoilers', '**Chris', 'Cleek', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'family', 'man', 'lawyer', 'family', 'perfect', 'way', 'loving', 'wife', 'successful', 'son', 'two', 'obedient', 'daughters', 'One', 'day', 'when', 'hunting', 'feral', 'cannibalistic', 'woman', 'bathing', 'lake', 'forcing', 'family', 'prepare', 'space', 'cellar', 'civilize', 'save', 'savage', 'ways', 'perfect', 'facade', 'crumbles', 'woman', 'sick', 'person', 'emerges', 'perfection', 'family', 'veneer', 'also', 'away', 'exposing', 'son', 'violent', 'tendencies', 'daughter', 'pregnancy', 'wife', 'complacency', 'anger', 'abject', 'horror', 'actions', 'Who', 'will', 'be', 'victorious', 'savage', 'woman', 'civilized', 'man', 'Who', 'more', 'monstrous', 'heard', 'Woman', 'last', 'year', 'Women', 'Horror', 'Month', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'watch', 'very', 'recently', 'expected', 'like', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'film', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'actors', 'underlying', 'message', 'Chris', 'Cleek', 'very', 'creepy', 'character', 'Gleefully', 'sadistic', 'magnetic', 'repellent', 'same', 'time', 'ideal', 'patriarch', 'ideal', 'nuclear', 'family', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'insane', 'ruling', 'family', 'iron', 'fist', 'women', 'life', 'are', 'cowed', 'fearful', 'result', 'mentality', 'women', 'are', 'inherently', 'inferior', 'men', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'wife', 'Belle', 'abuse', 'detriment', 'children', 'daughter', 'Peggy', 'music', 'books', 'cope', 'pregnancy', 'most', 'likely', 'product', 'incest', 'Even', 'women', 'girls', 'seen', 'passing', 'neighborhood', 'are', 'victimized', 'abused', 'men', 'Cleek', 'family', 'showing', ""n't"", 'isolated', 'incident', 'son', 'Brian', 'other', 'hand', 'being', 'groomed', 'be', 'exactly', 'process', 'proved', 'be', 'successful', 'disturbing', 'budding', 'serial', 'killer', 'behavior.Based', 'view', 'family', 'brutal', 'treatment', 'Woman', 'easy', 'just', 'assume', 'propagating', 'misogyny', 'core', 'Woman', 'women', 'roles', 'society', 'views', 'women', 'much', 'more', 'favorable', 'light', 'Woman', 'strong', 'character', 'untouched', 'influences', 'civilization', 'When', 'faced', 'Chris', 'only', 'woman', 'fight', 'back', 'continued', 'abuse', 'fact', 'Chris', 'wields', 'superior', 'weapons', 'Woman', 'down', 'never', 'fully', 'controlled', 'minute', 'released', 'catches', 'Chris', 'guard', 'son', 'brutally', 'misogyny', 'idea', 'women', 'weaker', 'sex', 'are', 'conventions', 'society', 'not', 'inherently', 'true', 'Belle', 'first', 'person', 'killed', 'released', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'upset', 'feel', 'sorry', 'victim', 'husband', 'However', 'feel', 'was', 'justified', 'allowed', 'children', 'be', 'abused', 'warped', 'husband', 'doing', 'just', 'as', 'guilty', 'Chris', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'left', 'kids', 'called', 'police', 'long', 'ago', 'chose', 'not', 'allowing', 'abuse', 'continue', 'years', 'Also', 'Chris', 'Cleek', 'shown', 'be', 'more', 'brutal', 'less', 'civilized', 'Woman', 'only', 'living', 'member', 'savage', 'cannibalistic', 'tribe', 'family', 'dynamic', 'question', 'traditional', 'patriarchal', 'family', 'unit', 'proving', 'nostalgia', 'past', 'supporting', 'dynamic', 'reality', 'perpetuating', 'abuse', 'world', 'characters', 'supports', 'misogyny', 'part', 'everyday', 'life', 'only', 'exception', 'being', 'Peggy', 'math', 'teacher', 'Miss', 'Hindle', 'aspect', 'commentary', 'atmosphere', 'own', 'society', 'how', 'are', 'numb', 'blinded', 'misogyny', 'are', 'bombarded', 'day.The', 'Woman', 'commentary', 'how', 'women', 'are', 'treated', 'society', 'present', 'past', 'film', 'had', 'few', 'surprising', 'twists', 'turns', 'including', 'showing', 'Chris', 'be', 'way', 'more', 'depraved', 'thought', 'saying', 'lot', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'just', 'enough', 'imagination', 'also', 'story', 'open', 'installment', 'really', 'film', 'hope', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'work', 'together', 'other', 'projects', 'future', 'would', 'recommend', 'people', 'looking', 'challenging', 'thought', 'provoking', 'times', 'difficult', 'watch', 'film']",N/A

It picks up with The woman wandering, alone, her children dead because of the child. She looks for shelter, has a dream of the kid, and begins making herself at home again. then the man enters. He, along with his wife, small child, older daughter and son, take her in to ""civilize her."" The problem is that the family is not civilized themselves, and the woman is not as weak as the man thinks she is.First, this is really like the book. There are a few differences at the end, sequence wise, but the book plays out more like Ketchum's work than I thought it would. That says a lot both about the way the source material was written, about the realism, and about the things the actors did. In my mind, they really managed to capture these characters and transfer them to the 102 minute showing.As far as a story, it can seem flawed in some ways. It simply picks up with a wild woman wandering the woods, and with this man finding her. That's not to say there isn't a lot of detail, but it seems disconnected as a stand alone film. As far as the woman goes, she seems incomplete. That's why I mentioned Offspring. Everything from the wound she has to the motivation she carries sits in that film, and it makes this more than understood. As far as the family goes, it is pretty complete except for one part. I do not want to spoil anything so I will only say the thing with the dogs to anyone who has seen it, noting that this piece just seems like another piece to say the man is not a good guy. I did like the oddity to it, but there was no ""who"" attached to it.I'm giving it a 4 out of 5, noting I am a fan of Ketchum and enjoyed this as well. I might not have known it existed otherwise, but knowing and seeing - I'm happy with it. My friends who enjoy horror will enjoy it I'm sure, liking the way the family turns into a character study on a small scale with each of them until the end comes.

1502636,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005SQRYB4,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","To call Lucky McKee's ""The Woman"" a horror movie would be misleading because, ""bloody"" and ""disgusting"" as it may be, the film itself is not scary. Obviously, to scare is not its aim. The seemingly absurd story of a father ""keeping"" a feral woman in a cellar, written by the director and Jack Ketchum (writer of the book upon which a 2007 film ""The Girl Next Door"" is based), serves more as a metaphor for gender conflict than as vehicle for mystery and suspense. So please don't expect something like a super-gory French horror.The story itself is rather simple. Chris Cleek (Sean Bridgers) is a successful lawyer, who has recently captured a ""monster"" woman (Pollyanna McIntosh) in the woods and is determined to ""civilize"" her. As the film goes on, we learn a few more things not about the woman, but the Cleek family. Obviously something is not quite right with the family, though what part is not clear yet.Gore is comparatively restrained in ""The Woman."" Instead, the film is rife with symbolism, mostly related to sexual desire (the boy's obsession with basketball, for instance, also seen in Pedro Almod&oacute;var's ""Live Flesh""). You can discuss the undercurrent themes and subtexts for hours, something academics love to talk about in cultural studies. Lucky McKee knows what he is doing, and with the talented cast including Angela Bettis (star of McKee's the better received ""May""), he has made his point pretty clearly.So, does the film work? Yes, but only with limited success. By presenting men-women dynamics in a brutal way, ""The Woman"" only repeats in a more explicit and straightforward fashion what other films, whether horror or not, have done before. That is not to say ""The Woman"" is not worth your time, but most moviegoers would find the film, with an exception of the final 15 minutes (including the bizarre post-credit scene), essentially not all that different from other works in the past.",3,A Horror?
