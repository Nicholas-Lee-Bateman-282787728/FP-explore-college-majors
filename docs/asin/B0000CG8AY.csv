The 1980's was the time when music exploded into the video realm; there is a huge body of work out there.  This disk had but a few choice selections from that period.  I specifically got this disk because it was at a very good price and it included A-ha, whose video was one of the greatest visual presentations I have ever seen, a perfect evocation of the genre of rock music and fandom.",3,"Brief, but okay",1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,496,"['DVD', 'only', 'few', '1980', 'best', 'works', 'far', 'far', 'far', 'being', 'comprehensive', 'look', '1980', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'music', 'exploded', 'video', 'realm', 'huge', 'body', 'work', 'there', 'disk', 'had', 'few', 'choice', 'selections', 'period', 'specifically', 'got', 'disk', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'price', 'included', 'A-ha', 'video', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'visual', 'presentations', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'perfect', 'evocation', 'genre', 'rock', 'music', 'fandom']",N/A

Sure, I taped huge numbers of the videos years ago, but this is DVD, right?Right.I'll confess that the main reason I bought this DVD is for a-ha's ""Take on Me"" video. It won top honors in its year of release as video of the year. Time has been kind to it. The video and the music hold up well.The B-52's ""Love Shack"" holds up well too. If you'll look, you'll see a pre-Superstar Ru Paul dancing in the video (Ru and the 52's are from the Atlanta/Athens, GA area).Devo's ""Whip it"" is still one of the oddest and guiltiest pleasures to come around.The Georgia Satellites' ""Keep your hands to yourself"" is a hillbilly rock song worthy of praise and one I'd forgotten.""Drive"" by the Cars and ""New Sensation"" are probably the two best produced videos on the DVD. They both show off the groups and are more ""classy"" than the others.All in all, I sure yearn for the days when MTV played videos all day and night long and allowed us to enjoy music in a whole new way. I also yearn for videos where the people in them seemed to be having fun....Worth the 8 bucks it costs!",4,Great videos at a decent price!,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,1114,"['Buy', 'DVD', 'videos', '80s', 'What', 'Am', 'nuts', 'Sure', 'taped', 'huge', 'numbers', 'videos', 'years', 'ago', 'DVD', 'right', 'Right.I', ""'ll"", 'confess', 'main', 'reason', 'bought', 'DVD', 'a-ha', 'Take', 'Me', 'video', 'won', 'top', 'honors', 'year', 'release', 'video', 'year', 'Time', 'been', 'kind', 'video', 'music', 'hold', 'up', 'well.The', 'B-52', 'Love', 'Shack', 'up', 'well', 'too', ""'ll"", 'look', ""'ll"", 'see', 'pre-Superstar', 'Ru', 'Paul', 'dancing', 'video', 'Ru', '52', 'are', 'Atlanta/Athens', 'GA', 'area', '.Devo', 'Whip', 'still', 'one', 'oddest', 'guiltiest', 'pleasures', 'come', 'around.The', 'Georgia', 'Satellites', 'Keep', 'hands', 'hillbilly', 'rock', 'song', 'worthy', 'praise', 'one', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'Drive', 'Cars', 'New', 'Sensation', 'are', 'probably', 'two', 'best', 'produced', 'videos', 'DVD', 'show', 'groups', 'are', 'more', 'classy', 'others.All', 'sure', 'yearn', 'days', 'when', 'MTV', 'played', 'videos', 'day', 'night', 'long', 'allowed', 'enjoy', 'music', 'whole', 'new', 'way', 'also', 'yearn', 'videos', 'where', 'people', 'seemed', 'be', 'having', 'fun', '8', 'bucks']",N/A
