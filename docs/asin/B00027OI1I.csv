They are very entertaining, and Brainy Baby Left Brain and Right Brain are very educational and engaging too.  Baby Babble has added something missing from our video collection and my son loves it.  The two therapists focus on speech production with focusing on their mouth, movement and placement of lips and tongue too.  Also, they add sounds of the toys that you see, and the toys are very visual and educational.  My son is speech delayed and within four days of watching this video, everyday at least once a day, he added five new phrases to his vocabulary and learned to stick his tongue out and be more aware of his own mouth.  He requests this video every day, and I would encourage anyone with a child with speech delay to try this video. I think it is very well done and the video is clear and professionally made.

From the first time I played it, my son enjoyed the DVD, it made him laugh, and he began to increase his vocabulary.  I've seen a few reviews that compared the quality of this DVD to Baby Einstein or the appearance of the individuals appearing in Baby Babble.  The bottom line is this, it's about helping your child enhance language skills.  If it holds his or her attention and it works, the quality is besides the point.  And its important to consider that the appearance of the women in this program are focusing on facial expressions to help language not to attract attention to themselves.",5,It worked for us and we recommend it!,1127433600,"09 23, 2005",2005,680,"['child', 'speech', 'delayed', 'great', 'DVD', 'try', 'help', 'along', 'first', 'time', 'played', 'son', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'made', 'laugh', 'began', 'increase', 'vocabulary', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'reviews', 'compared', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'appearance', 'individuals', 'appearing', 'Baby', 'Babble', 'bottom', 'line', 'helping', 'child', 'enhance', 'language', 'skills', 'attention', 'quality', 'point', 'important', 'consider', 'appearance', 'women', 'program', 'are', 'focusing', 'facial', 'expressions', 'help', 'language', 'not', 'attract', 'attention']",N/A
825789,ATJ47ZS435GZT,B00027OI1I,liz56,"[1, 1]","My child has been watching the entire Baby Babble series since he was about a year old. He is 17 months old now and many of his first words (SPEAKING words, not just sign language) have come from watching these videos. Words like baby, daddy, mommy, up, down, out, more, truck, please, thank you, all done, eat, and countless others. The videos are designed to hold the short attention span of young children, and they definitely do. The intervals of music, incorporation of sounds, talking, simple objects, etc. ---all of those are specifically directed toward babies and toddlers. In my opinion, this series is better than Baby Einstein, Brainy Baby, etc. for the older baby/young toddler. It might be ""too educational"" for the really young baby. But, from 9 months to age 2 1/2 or maybe even older, I would say this series is THE BEST out there for speech, learning, and ""quiet time."". The series even focuses on certain letters like p,b, and m or t, d, n which directly coincides with the appropriate level of speech that a child is capable of learning as he/she grows. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE BABY BABLE SERIES (There are 3 in the series.)My child has learned a TON from it. He is usually very picky with what he has the attention span to watch, but these videos totally captivate him and not just every now and then, pretty much whenever we turn it on. Oh and as an added benefit, the videos are quite calming for the parents and the creators' approach toward teaching the concepts is actually quite fascinating.  A nice break from some of the ""annoying"" shows and DVDs that are out there for kids. And an overall great way to expose your child to language/learning.

When he finally started to talk with the help of a speech therapist after having watched these DVDs many times, he started to speak and we found we had build a great vocabulary for him and finally the words all came out........",5,Helped us with speech delayed child,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,582,"['Bought', 'level', '2', 'Learned', 'lot', 'how', 'help', 'speech', 'delayed', 'child', 'learn', 'words', 'develop', 'muscles', 'face', 'enable', 'speak', 'Created', 'flash', 'cards', 'Followed', 'exercises', 'liked', 'teh', 'interactive', 'parts', 'where', 'could', 'push', 'DVD', 'buttons', 'move', 'things', 'along', 'learned', 'patterns', 'watched', 'DVDs', 'over', 'When', 'finally', 'started', 'talk', 'help', 'speech', 'therapist', 'having', 'watched', 'DVDs', 'many', 'times', 'started', 'speak', 'found', 'had', 'build', 'great', 'vocabulary', 'finally', 'words', 'came', 'out', '..']",N/A

She is rather speaking very well at 15 months. I wanted to make her speech stronger. I think that Einstein DVDs are much better and more fun. It's too boring and slow for her age. However, if I bought it at 3 months, I would have thought better of it because newborns enjoys quiet things like these more than toddlers. Anyway, i should be a good purchase if you have a speech delayed kid who likes watching quiet and boring videos lol. It's also OVERPRICED.

My only ""complaint"" (and i hesitate to call it that) is how the one woman (Amy?) isn't smiling/grining when she does the sounds and facial expressions. Maybe she's not suppose to so that the child will focus more on how to mimic her, but she just looks so ""dumpy"" instead of friendly.Other than that, i think this is a great DVD!

You show my son a letter and he will tell you the letter and he knows what sound most of the letters make.  However, his words are just not coming out correctly (eg. ""Bus"" is ""Bu"" & he signs ""Bus"".  My son is not allowed to watch regular TV but some educational videos that he LOVES.  He mostly watches Signing Time videos and Your Baby Can Read.  He tries to speak as he signs the word when watching these videos.  He also owns the Trebelina DVD, which teaches how to read music, and he dances to that video.  These Baby Babble DVDs did not hold his attention at all.  Most of the words he already hears & visually recognizes from either Your Baby Can Read or Signing Time.  They do BRIEFLY go through some of the vowel sounds - and I found that to be something he has not already been exposed to.

I had never heard of ""Baby Babble"" before, and was curious about it so I put it on and watched to see what my son would do. My son is 26 months old, is diagnosed with Autism, and Sensory Processing Disorder and severe speech delays.The first few times he watched it, he was very intent on it. It is very similar to the ""Baby Einstein"" DVDs in that it is colorful, has music and is fast-paced. After seeing how much he liked it, I decided to start putting it on once a day as a ""Speech Therapy"" at home kind of thing. The more he has watched it, the more he has learned to do the things on it. He has learned a few sounds, facial expressions, and he even signs with it! I am amazed at how every day he seems to learn more from it.I know there are a wide variety of reviews on this DVD - most of them great five star reviews, but some of them not so great. The DVD is very low budget and that gets a lot of people upset. Most of the scenes are toys that spin or make music, the speech pathologists using toys, and the speech pathologists signing, or making noises and sounds. You can tell it's done in their home, and at times you can see the string or the hands ""behind the camera.""I say all that to say this: my son doesn't care about any of that he's just a kid and I'm sure he doesn't notice. It's not supposed to be anything crazy, it's supposed to be simple and very much like you would get at a speech therapy lesson. My son has been attending speech therapy since he was 18 months old and I have seen the different methods they have used.This DVD is right on and I like that he can have speech therapy right in our living room. He has interacted more with this video at home then he has ever done in an actual speech therapy session and that means more to me than anything! A lot of speech delays are caused by something called ""low tone,"" which relates to the muscle tone in the mouth and cheeks. My son has this problem and because of that he needs exercises that help to strengthen those muscles. Blowing, sticking out your tongue, and funny funny facial expressions are all things done on this DVD and are great for developing muscle tone in the face. My son copies those as well and I know in the past he was physically unable to do things like that because his muscle tone was so low. Through therapy it's gotten better, and I am thrilled that this DVD works on those things as well.At the end of the DVD, the therapists give you tips and tricks to help your child learn how to talk. There is also a section for signs so that you can learn along with your child. These tips and suggestions have been very helpful to me, especially as a mother of a child with speech delays.""Up"" has been one of my son's only words for several months now and it's so encouraging to see him interacting and doing sounds and signs with this video. I think this is going to be a big help for him and have already told his speech therapist about it. I also plan to buy the next two volumes.
