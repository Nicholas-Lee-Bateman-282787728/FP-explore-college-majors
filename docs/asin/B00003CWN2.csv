There was not one thing I could hang onto that was hopeful or uplifting. Had I known it was full of scenes of someone getting brutally raped and beaten over and over again I wouldn't have watched it.It is not my kind of movie.I do admire Hillary Swank and no one could have pulled off this transformation into a male better. Unfortunately there were far too many gratuitous scenes of her naked, bleeding, bruised and beaten, alternating with scenes of her naked, and having other people's hands all over her face and body and hair alternating with scenes of people pulling her clothes off. Did I say gratuitous?Spoiler alert, stop reading if you don't want to know the story...A certain Texas impoverished redneck trailer park mood was created and it was easy to see from the time we saw the two disgusting backwoods thugs that something horrible would happen to Brandon when they found out he was really a she. The rapes and beatings toward the end came as no surprise.Violence, drinking, stints in jail, self destructive urges and acts, and a slightly built young woman running around pretending to be a boy and having sex with the girls is a recipe for disaster in this sorry town.Brandon had a winning grin and very warm smile which rarely left his face, and huge ultrawhite teeth and very full lips that I have not seen on any men,along with a tiny neck and no adam's apple, but these people were a little dim and didn't notice anything amiss with Mr. Brandon as long as he partied and got drunk with them every night. If Brandon were in most towns he would be regarded with deep suspicion I think.Brandon was very clevor about the sex act with his girlfriend. She couldn't even tell it wasn't the real McCoy. And when she finally saw Brandon in the women's jail and he/she admitted to being a ""hermaphrodite"" she couldn't care less what Brandon was, she was just so in love. The brutes who killed him probably would have found another victim to kill at some point. Brandon was a convenient excuse to exercise some pent up aggression.I gave it three stars for the acting, particularly Miss Swank's, but left off two stars for the horrific scenes and constant pawing at the nude body of the transgendered girl. Clearly she would never leave this hellaceous town alive. This movie was well done yet very predictable and as gratuitous as they come at the same time.

517904,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CWN2,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","`Boy's Don't Cry' is the type of film that will prove it's title wrong, displaying enough emotional despair to make the burliest of men break down in tears.  Recounting the true life story of Teena Brandon, a young woman with a sexual identity crisis that lived her life as Brandon Teena and was eventually raped and murdered in 1993, `Boy's Don't Cry' hits every mark precisely and delivers one of the most well proportioned films in recent years.  Director Kimberly Pierce masterfully achieves accuracy and authenticity with levels of unique elegance and sets a mood that is piercingly calm while subtly unnerving.  Watching this young woman's life slowly spiral out of control is so tempered and paced that it almost creeps up on you despite the fact that it's been unraveling quite rapidly before your very eyes.The heart and soul behind this tragic retelling is that of Hilary Swank who delivers a brilliant breakout performance in which she disappears within the skin of Teena or better yet Brandon and completely convinces the audience of her lies, deceiving us as much as she's deceiving her fellow cast mates.  Swanks performance is so brutally convincing that the viewer is swallowed in her frustration, her pain and her confusion.  We are completely attached to her and never want to let her go.  Swank is not alone though for the entire supporting cast is spot on as well, most notably Chloe Sevigny and Peter Sarsgaard who command their scenes and our emotions.  Chloe plays Lana, Brandon's love interest.  Her innocence and naivety makes her understandable, but it's her compassion in the heat of crashing hope that makes her lovable and sympathetic.  I wept almost more for her character than that of Swank herself.  Sarsgaard's character John evokes in us a drastically different emotional response.  John, Lana's ex-boyfriend and Brandon's supposed friend is unsympathetic, irrational, violent and controlling and as we watch Peter Sarsgaard create and manipulate his own performance we're forced to appreciate his genius.  His performance is utterly flawless.As Teena's story is told we are brought to an understanding and or appreciation for the lives and or trials of others.  Teena is not much different than the rest of us, a confused young girl who did all that she could to be who she knew she was regardless of the gender card she was dealt.  We all struggle in our own ways to become the person we know we are yet never are given to opportunity to unveil and so watching her determined struggle should give us all a sense of respect for this brave young woman.  As tragic as this biopic is it's a film that we should all experience and learn from.Watching Swank, Sevigny and Sarsgaard chew up their performances before our eyes is fascinating to watch, three young actors devouring these characters with a mature fervor that is hard pressed to find in some of our more advanced and experienced actors.  Swank earned the Oscar she won for this and Sevigny, as much as I adored Jolie in her respective film, deserved the Oscar as well for her heartbreaking performance.  The fact that Peter Sarsgaard was snubbed altogether of a nomination is enough to make me cry so I won't talk of that too much.  `Boy's Don't Cry' is a masterpiece of a film, one that will break your heart and crush your spirits but in the end amaze and move you beyond words.",5,"Heartbreaking in every sense of the word, moving and utterly flawless in delivery...",1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,3371,"['Boy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'type', 'film', 'will', 'prove', 'title', 'wrong', 'displaying', 'enough', 'emotional', 'despair', 'make', 'burliest', 'men', 'break', 'down', 'tears', 'Recounting', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'young', 'woman', 'sexual', 'identity', 'crisis', 'lived', 'life', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'was', 'eventually', 'raped', 'murdered', '1993', 'Boy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'hits', 'mark', 'precisely', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'proportioned', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'Director', 'Kimberly', 'Pierce', 'masterfully', 'accuracy', 'authenticity', 'levels', 'unique', 'elegance', 'mood', 'piercingly', 'calm', 'subtly', 'unnerving', 'Watching', 'young', 'woman', 'life', 'slowly', 'spiral', 'control', 'so', 'tempered', 'paced', 'almost', 'up', 'fact', 'been', 'unraveling', 'quite', 'rapidly', 'very', 'eyes.The', 'heart', 'soul', 'tragic', 'retelling', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'who', 'brilliant', 'breakout', 'performance', 'skin', 'Teena', 'better', 'yet', 'Brandon', 'completely', 'audience', 'lies', 'deceiving', 'as', 'much', 'deceiving', 'fellow', 'cast', 'mates', 'Swanks', 'performance', 'so', 'brutally', 'convincing', 'viewer', 'swallowed', 'frustration', 'pain', 'confusion', 'are', 'completely', 'attached', 'never', 'want', 'let', 'go', 'Swank', 'not', 'alone', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'spot', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'notably', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'command', 'scenes', 'emotions', 'Chloe', 'Lana', 'Brandon', 'love', 'interest', 'innocence', 'naivety', 'understandable', 'compassion', 'heat', 'crashing', 'hope', 'lovable', 'sympathetic', 'wept', 'almost', 'more', 'character', 'Swank', 'Sarsgaard', 'character', 'John', 'drastically', 'different', 'emotional', 'response', 'John', 'Lana', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Brandon', 'supposed', 'friend', 'unsympathetic', 'irrational', 'violent', 'controlling', 'watch', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'create', 'manipulate', 'own', 'performance', ""'re"", 'forced', 'appreciate', 'genius', 'performance', 'utterly', 'flawless.As', 'Teena', 'story', 'told', 'are', 'brought', 'understanding', 'appreciation', 'lives', 'trials', 'others', 'Teena', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'rest', 'confused', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'did', 'could', 'be', 'who', 'knew', 'was', 'regardless', 'gender', 'card', 'was', 'dealt', 'struggle', 'own', 'ways', 'become', 'person', 'know', 'are', 'yet', 'never', 'are', 'given', 'opportunity', 'unveil', 'so', 'watching', 'determined', 'struggle', 'should', 'give', 'sense', 'respect', 'brave', 'young', 'woman', 'As', 'tragic', 'biopic', 'film', 'should', 'experience', 'learn', 'from.Watching', 'Swank', 'Sevigny', 'Sarsgaard', 'chew', 'up', 'performances', 'eyes', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'three', 'young', 'actors', 'devouring', 'characters', 'mature', 'fervor', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'more', 'advanced', 'experienced', 'actors', 'Swank', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'won', 'Sevigny', 'as', 'much', 'adored', 'Jolie', 'respective', 'film', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'as', 'well', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'fact', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'was', 'snubbed', 'altogether', 'nomination', 'enough', 'make', 'cry', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'too', 'much', 'Boy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'crush', 'spirits', 'end', 'amaze', 'move', 'words']",N/A
517905,A4VH04TA14CPE,B00003CWN2,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[1, 3]","I don't really know how ""accurate"" the film is in portraying the main character. Apparently there was some sort of controversy over this. I think it doesn't matter that much: it's a feature film, not a biography. Of course it stylizes its characters. Complaining about this just distracts from the substance of the film.So, I don't know what Teena Brandon was really like. But, in the director's interpretation, she is a deeply confused and helpless person, the scatterbrained type who doesn't quite understand the world around her. She doesn't really know what to do with her life, she has no plan and nothing to look forward to. However, she is very imaginative, and invents a detailed biography for herself. She also calls herself Brandon Teena and attempts to pass herself off as a man, but she also fabricates other parts of her life that don't deal with her gender. For instance, she tells the other characters that she has a child, with no prompting on their part. She doesn't tell lies ""on purpose,"" it's more like she needs to believe them herself. Her ""sexual identity crisis"" (her words, and she says them like she doesn't quite know what they mean) is part of a much larger, more general ""identity crisis.""She commits theft, but she is essentially harmless to society. If she could find some kind of direction in life, she might find it easy to live normally, unlike the characters John and Tom, who really are genuine criminals, incapable of living any other way and unwilling to try. But more than anything, Brandon wants to be loved and accepted, instinctively. It doesn't really matter by whom. Consequently, she enters dangerous territory without understanding the risk to herself.Long after the audience has realized that Brandon should leave town as soon as possible, she stays. Even after the first assault, it still seems like she doesn't understand her situation. Some critics complained about this aspect of Brandon's character, but I think it gives an air of genuine tragedy to the film. It's almost as if her fate is forcing her to stay.The film reminded me a lot of Gus Van Sant's ""My Own Private Idaho,"" which is also about a lonely drifter who is stuck in a desolate region and craves love more than anything else. ""Boys Don't Cry"" is much better, because it lacks Van Sant's Shakespearean pretensions. But like Van Sant's film, ""Boys Don't Cry"" is best at appearances. The script is barely there. Half the film just wanders through dingy trailers, houses, bars and convenience stores, with convincingly forgettable dialogue. Most scenes are shot at night, usually indoors, so nature is totally absent. There's very little exposition. We don't really learn anything about the characters, but this is perfectly accurate. There is nothing to learn about them, and there's really nothing interesting that they could talk about.But we can look at their faces, which are all chosen very well for the roles. Chloe Sevigny, as Lana, is immediately recognizable. Every suburb or small town has a girl like this, with a sullen face and a deliberately abrasive attitude intended to conceal her naivete. Every other face in the film is just as archetypical.There is a moment of foreshadowing early in the film when John first encourages Brandon to drive over the speed limit, and then threatens her after they get pulled over by police. The impulsive, unreasoning way he goes from friendly to hostile is all the more frightening because it's so unexpected. When he finds out about Brandon's gender, he screams his disgust, but his anger is motivated more by ""traditional"" sexual jealousy. He would have assaulted a male rival also. But another man, especially one similar to John, might have been able to defend himself, whereas Brandon's gender and personality combine to make her uniquely vulnerable and defenseless, and this is the saddest thing about the story.I do have a few problems with the film. It's very noticeable that all of the men in the film are vile and callous, not just John and Tom, but also the cops and the guys in the bar. At the same time, all of the women are basically sympathetic, not just Lana, but also her friend and even Lana's mother. Even if the women feel disgusted at Brandon's cross-dressing at first, they quickly come to support her. But the men never feel any remorse or sympathy, just rage and fear, and they blindly victimize everyone. I guess I can accept this in these particular characters, but still, I wonder about the director's intent.The inevitable, brutal ending drags on for about half an hour, long after the conclusion becomes obvious. And the very last scene has a screaming toddler for maximum gut-wrenching effect. These lurid scenes may be manipulative (a similar scene in ""Brokeback Mountain"" is effective but occurs much more quickly), but there is also something believable in them. These men don't know anything that might inspire them to listen to reason or to feel compassion. It is hopeless to beg them for mercy.I also don't quite believe the tender love scene between Lana and Brandon right after the first assault. The director includes it for pathos, to make the audience hope for their salvation, and to underscore how happy they might have been. But I'd suppose that right after such a terrifying experience, one would be too severely traumatized to express one's passion.But, for most of its duration, the film is perceptive and believable, with a sympathetic and tragic heroine undone by circumstances that are too much for her to handle. The film is well in keeping with the tradition of American stories about marginal youth. If you like that subject, or if you are willing to consider watching a film about it, ""Boys Don't Cry"" is a good choice.",4,"Like Van Sant's early films, but maybe better.",1182211200,"06 19,

It feels especially pertinent in an age of red-state vs. blue state cultural diviseness.  First-time director, Kimberly Peirce, a real artist, avoids such alienating and inaccurate generalities, and grounds her progressive values of equality and opportunity in the psyches and motivations of her characters.  Beginning in a roller-rink fantasia, the film immediately draws one into Brandon Teena's (the deservedly accoladed Hilary Swank) enthusiastic and unattainable dream.  As the plot develops, Peirce expertly balances the ominous and the exciting, pitting Brandon's relationship with Lana (a dynamite Chloe Sevigny) against Lana's violent ex-boyfriend, John (an eerie and charismatic Peter Sarsgaard).  The engrossing drama exists within the socio-political mileu of rural disadvantage, ignorance, and substance abuse (how many scenes convey characters drinking alcohol?) enabling the viewer to reap a multi-faceted and rewarded viewing experience.

Hilary Swank belongs in this category when she did Boys Don't Cry in 1999. The first time I saw the film about ten years ago, I did not realize that it was the same actress from The Karate Kid Part III. After finding it out, I was still in a disbelief. Watching Hilary playing Brandon, I actually believed that she was a he. So, that being typed, it's a dramatic turnaround for her from being a bad actress to one of the best actresses there is. Her performance in Million Dollar Baby cements the statement. Back to Boys Don't Cry, obviously the story is tragic, full of bigotry, and surprisingly human. Thanks to the cast especially Chlo Sevigny, it's a well-played masterpiece from start to finish with a superbly handled direction by Kimberly Peirce. It is actually nice a film this serious depicting a female protagonist be directed by a female; it's a break from the usual male-dominated perspective. I like the David Lynch look in the cinematography which is pretty close to the one in Mulholland Drive.

It culminates with the discovery that Brandon is actually a woman with a dramatic confrontation in the finale.  A lot of people think that this is a story about courage and lesbianism but it is really about neither. It is about the search for identity; not just sexual identity but the search for a deeper self.  Here was a person they loved and accepted, but who turned out to be the most heinous of deviants as defined by their own prejudices and fears. This is why they were so fundamentally shaken upon the revelation of Brandon's true identity.Very disturbing is the ending. If you know the story, you know the ending.

It made me literally SICK and ANGRY!!That night before they could leave town, The boys came back and murdered Teena Brandon, and the girl who put her up in her shed while hiding her out.There may have even been another murder, It has been so long since I have seen it, I am not sure.Not only the girls rape made me sick, but the WHOLE unacceptance from EVERYONE, and how she always had to HIDE who and what she was...and HER acceptance of THIER UNacceptance just makes you CRY.Although horribly upsetting, It is a must see...I know this movie set a lot of Gay rights into motion, and there are web sites you can go to and read about the REAL Teena Brandon, If you go to a search engine and type in her name.She was a brave and wonderful young girl, and I am glad her death wasn't TOTALLY in vain.What an awful waste of such a gentle and beautiful soul.",5,The horrors of Ignorance- A TRUE STORY,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,2580,"['was', 'literally', 'speachless', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'pretty', 'raw', 'movie', 'make', 'speachless', 'also', 'felt', 'disgust', 'sadness', 'complete', 'horror', 'teenage', 'boys', 'were', 'so', 'insecure', 'uneducated', 'homosexuals', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'different', 'actually', 'commited', 'murder', 'true', 'story', 'girl', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'Played', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'who', 'was', 'lesbian', 'lived', 'small', 'midwestern', 'town', 'did', ""n't"", 'accept', 'homosexuality', 'met', 'friends', 'town', 'hundred', 'miles', 'away', 'where', 'one', 'knew', 'her.She', 'came', 'know', 'whole', 'new', 'circle', 'friends', 'who', 'upon', 'introduction', 'believed', 'be', 'boy', 'accepted', 'reversed', 'first', 'name', 'last', 'name', 'instead', 'being', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'was', 'now', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'continued', 'living', 'masqurade', 'not', 'DARING', 'let', 'discover', 'true', 'sex', 'even', 'fell', 'love', 'town', 'girl', 'had', 'crush', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'became', 'friends', 'girls', 'drinking', 'buddies', 'guys', 'was', 'dream', 'acceptance', 'come', 'true', 'began', 'suspect', 'true', 'sexual', 'identity.Her', 'girlfriend', 'DID', 'stick', 'wanted', 'run', 'off', 'was', 'hick', 'town', 'anyway', 'PLUS', 'had', 'real', 'family', 'there', 'speak', 'none', 'really', 'cared', 'did', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'brother', 'who', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'accept', 'so', '2', 'were', 'going', 'run', 'off', 'could-', 'tragedy', 'struck.2', 'redneck', 'RAPED', 'most', 'horribly', 'convincing', 'rape', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'when', 'went', 'police', 'took', 'sides', 'boys', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'arrest', 'tried', 'make', 'whole', 'thing', 'sexuality', 'PROVOKED', 'horrendous', 'rape', 'made', 'literally', 'SICK', 'ANGRY', 'night', 'could', 'leave', 'town', 'boys', 'came', 'back', 'murdered', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'girl', 'who', 'put', 'up', 'shed', 'hiding', 'out.There', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'murder', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'have', 'seen', 'am', 'not', 'sure.Not', 'only', 'girls', 'rape', 'made', 'sick', 'WHOLE', 'unacceptance', 'EVERYONE', 'how', 'always', 'had', 'HIDE', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'HER', 'acceptance', 'THIER', 'UNacceptance', 'just', 'CRY.Although', 'horribly', 'upsetting', 'must', 'see', 'know', 'movie', 'set', 'lot', 'Gay', 'rights', 'motion', 'are', 'web', 'sites', 'can', 'go', 'read', 'REAL', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'go', 'search', 'engine', 'type', 'name.She', 'was', 'brave', 'wonderful', 'young', 'girl', 'am', 'glad', 'death', 'was', ""n't"", 'TOTALLY', 'vain.What', 'awful', 'waste', 'such', 'gentle', 'beautiful', 'soul']",N/A

The question that immediately comes to mind is, how many contemporary actresses have the talent of Hilary Swank?  She is absolutely amazing as Brandon, the main character of the movie.  Her performance is nothing less than astounding and she deserved every bit of her academy award.  .The movie is about a young woman named Teena Brandon who wants to be a man and, therefore, lives her life under the alias of Brandon Teena.  She goes to live in an area of viral white trash that is unlike any region I've ever seen and undoubtedly unlike any region which actually exists.The rural community she moves into is Hollywood's version of the heartland and it doesn't seem to have much relation to the real thing.  It is a dark fantasy of American life wherein religion has been transfused from the local culture. The population of the countryside seems to have been replaced with the inhabitants of a large mental hospital.  Yet, anti-social personalities can be found everywhere and this area of Nebraska is no exception.  Swank's character is highly unfortunate to have befriended two of them.  John and Tom are felons with no respect for the law or any other human beings, and the heroine, through no real fault of her own, unwittingly becomes the target of their ire.Peter Sarsgaard plays a convincing monster who is the source of most of the film's drama while the love affair between Swank and Chloe Sevigny was quite authentic.

Boys Don't Cry claims to be based on the real life murder of Teena Brandon, but gets a lot of it wrong. The true life tragedy brought to the forefront a lot of issues involving poverty, domestic violence, violence against women, women's position in rural society to name a few. Unfortunately about 85% went unnoticed because the public eye immediately focused on the cross-dressing, gay bashing, political implication to the exclusion of everything else. This film takes the already narrow view of the story and strips it even more of the real person in it by transforming it into a traditional butch lesbian romance to the 80's New Wave of the Cure while the real person was mad about the square dancing and everything country and western to name one instance. The story is simplified further by reducing the motivation of the bad guys to simple ignorance and out of control anger. No sense is given of the protagonist's past or what drives him. Fictional scenes are added to make the marginal guys good and bad guys into people who could not help themselves. Also gone is the bravado, the arrogance and the flamboyance of the true life Brandon replaced by the strong solitude of the &quot;Karate Kid&quot; Hillary Swank. The actors are good, but the casting os off and the historical person who was tiny, slight and driven by nervous energy is replaced by a tall and reserved sailor/soldier type, creating a totally different feel.

Director Kimberly Peirce presents us with yet another example of our inability to accept someone in our midst who is not like us. In the setting of this  movie there is actually little tolerance for any deviation. You need to be  tough, to drink, to enjoy the most primitive forms of recreation. Others  have said that the protagonist Teena Brandon had fallen in with trailer  trash, but she didn't just fall in with them. She was born into that  setting, and played the same role (In real life she was a bigger thief than  the movie indicated). If her parents had been wealthy, and she had been a  student at Harvard she most likely wouldn't have been part of the world  that destroyed her.Teena Brandon becomes Brandon Teena because she  doesn't belong in the body that she was born with. She tries desperately to  find some happiness in assuming the role of a male. The movie is  unremittingly bleak. None of the characters is remotely close to being  happy. There is not one single moment of humor in this two-hour film. The  only way Director Peirce could have made the movie more somber would be to  have filmed it in black and white. There are no heroes in this movie; even  the best of them fail to support one another at some point. Brandon's new  friend Lana leaves him stranded on a lonely road, at night, in the middle  of nowhere. Candace takes Brandon in, but can't help babbling to the bad  guys. Lana's drunken sot of a mother at last finds poor Brandon to be the  one person in the world that she feels she can look down on.We often go  to &quot;feel good&quot; movies to see characters who really come through  for one another when the chips are down.

The fact that this is a true story resonates deep and makes watching this film all that much more gripping and then heart breaking as it spirals towards its brutal final frames.  Brandon (Swank in a riviting performance) moves to Nebrasca to start her life over, getting involved with all the wrong crowd and falling in love with the wrong girl (Chloe Sevigny who just does brilliantly here), a girl once involved with the town bad@$$ played by Peter Sarsgaard in yet another Oscar snubbed performance.  Brandon befriends all of these people, even residing with some of them, until her secret is revieled and her life is tragically changed.  The acting in this film carries it to the next level by making you feel emotions you would never feel otherwise.  It's heartwrenching as you expirience life through this womans eyes and see what she sees, feel what she feels and watch as her life comes smashing down on her.  I think we take our lives for granted when we live simple excepted lives, lives that never get a frown or a dirty look or a comment behind our back, or in the case of Brandon Teena, a bullet in the chest.  We just go on living and never give it a second thought.

""brandon, you're either gonna end up in jail for a long time...or dead.""  the moment when the carpet got pulled out from under me emotionally in the film was when brandon was in court waiting to face sentencing for car theft...and he/she turned around and walked out.  it was like placing the kiss of death on herself.so, i know this is a rambling review.  i hope it's helped someone somewhat, and i know it's helped me to write it.  i just found this film so disturbing, and it just shines the light for me on the fact that we live in a world that makes it VERY VERY hard for some people to live a happy, well-adjusted life.  i guess in our own ways it's hard for all of us.got bless brandon...i wish you'd had better luck.",5,"oh god, what do i say?",1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,2763,"['i', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'much', 'stopped', 'writing', 'reviews', 'movie', 'drew', 'back', 'ring', 'i', 'usually', 'have', 'strong', 'point', 'view', 'things', 'i', 'read', 'watch', 'can', 'critique', 'comfortably', 'not', 'one', 'i', 'know', 'i', 'felt', 'disturbed', 'slept', 'horribly', 'watching', 'i', 'think', 'kicked', 'up', 'real', 'deep', 'stuff', 'i', 'still', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'quality', 'shined', 'through.incidentally', 'almost', 'stopped', 'watching', 'entirely', 'couple', 'times', 'film', 'was', 'film', 'FEW', 'others', 'i', 'could', 'call', 'TRULY', 'DEPRESSING', 'crux', 'what', 'made', 'feel', 'depressing', 'was', 'was', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'STUCK', 'life', 'felt', 'so', 'few', 'options', 'brandon', 'only', 'choice', 'was', 'live', 'lie', 'he/she', 'so', 'wanted', 'be', 'something', 'he/she', 'was', ""n't"", 'she/he', 'just', 'had', 'pile', 'lie', 'lie', 'what', 'killed', 'was', 'story', 'person', 'who', 'just', 'SIMPLY', 'DID', 'NOT', 'FIT', 'IN', 'OUR', 'SOCIETY', 'i', 'guess', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'about', 'was', 'major', 'criticism', 'society', 'society', 'just', 'people', 'who', 'fit', 'narrow', 'little', 'windows', 'sex', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'certainly', 'gender', 'god', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'comfortably', 'choose', 'pronoun', 'he/she', 'brandon', 'how', 'would', 'feel', 'BE', 'brandon', 'teena', 'i', 'really', 'do', 'think', 'brandon', 'was', 'man', 'woman', 'boy', 'girl', 'he/she', 'was', 'person', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'society', 'small-minded', 'ways', 'brandon', 'just', 'did', 'best', 'he/she', 'could', 'picked', 'team', 'started', 'playing', 'felt', 'more', 'man', 'tried', 'going', 'way', 'i', 'am', 'therapist', 'wondered', 'how', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'dealt', 'patient', 'brandon', 'suggested', 'sex-change', 'suggested', 'more', 'self-acceptance', 'suggested', 'anything', 'cried', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'got', 'i', 'found', 'painful', 'was', 'brandon', 'problems', 'were', 'not', 'just', 'gender', 'gay', 'friend', 'summed', 'up', 'nicely', 'consequences', 'his/her', 'destructive', 'criminal/lying/irresponsible', 'tendencies', 'what', 'i', 'remember', 'brandon', ""'re"", 'gon', 'end', 'up', 'jail', 'long', 'time', 'dead', 'moment', 'when', 'carpet', 'got', 'pulled', 'out', 'emotionally', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'brandon', 'was', 'court', 'waiting', 'face', 'sentencing', 'car', 'theft', 'he/she', 'turned', 'walked', 'out', 'was', 'placing', 'kiss', 'death', 'herself.so', 'i', 'know', 'rambling', 'review', 'i', 'hope', 'helped', 'someone', 'somewhat', 'i', 'know', 'helped', 'write', 'i', 'just', 'found', 'film', 'so', 'disturbing', 'just', 'light', 'fact', 'live', 'world', 'VERY', 'VERY', 'hard', 'people', 'live', 'happy', 'well-adjusted', 'life', 'i', 'guess', 'own', 'ways', 'hard', 'us.got', 'bless', 'brandon', 'i', 'wish', ""'d"", 'had', 'better', 'luck']",N/A

It was very effective to have us see Hilary Swank (who plays Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon) with short hair and male facial expressions and gestures without giving us a glimpse of her as Teena. (Actually we did get a brief glimpse in a photo.) Swank looks like a boy, acts like a boy, in fact works hard to be a boy; indeed that is (sadly) part of what this movie is about, what it means to be a boy in middle America as opposed to being a girl. And then when we have the scene with the tampons and the breast wrapping and we see her legs, the effect is startling, an effect possibly lost on those who knew that the person playing Brandon was a woman. It was when I saw her legs and could tell at a glance that she was a woman with a woman's legs that I realized just how subtle, but unmistakable are the anatomical sexual differences, and how convincing Swank's portrayal was.I was reminded as I watched this of being a young person, of being a teenager and going through all the rituals and rites, unspoken, unplanned, without social sanction, that we all go through to prove our identity, because that is what Brandon was so eager to do, to prove his identity as a boy. I thought, ah such an advantage he has with the girls because he knows what they like and what they want. He can be smooth, and how pretty he looks. It was strange. I actually knew some guys in my youth who had such talent, and the girls did love them.The direction by Kimberly Peirce is nicely paced and the forebodings of horror to come are sprinkled lightly throughout so that we don't really think about the resolution perhaps until the campfire scene in which John Lotter shows his self-inflicted scars and tosses the knife to Brandon. Then we know for sure that something bad is going to happen.Hilary Swank is very convincing. Her performance is stunning, and she deserved the Academy Award she won for Best Actress. She is the type of tomboy/girl so beloved of the French cinema, tomboyish, but obvious a girl like, for example, Zouzou as seen in Chloe in the Afternoon (1972) or Elodie Bouchez in the The Dreamlife of Angels (1998), or many others. Indeed, one is even reminded of Juliette Binoche, who of course can play anything, or going way back, Leslie Caron in Gigi (1958). Chloe Signvey, who plays Lana Tisdel, the girl Brandon loves, whom I first saw in Palmetto (1998), where she stole a scene or two from Woody Harrelson and Elisabeth Shue, really comes off ironically as butch to Swank, yet manages a sexy, blue collar girl next door femininity. She also does a great job. Peter Sarsgaard is perfect as John Lotter, trailer trash car thief and homophobic redneck degenerate.Very disturbing is the ending. If you know the story, you know the ending. Just how true this was to the real life story it is based on is really irrelevant. I knew nothing about the story, but I know that film makers always take license to tell it the way they think it will play best, and so it's best to just experience the film as the film, independent of the real story, which, like all real stories, can never be totally told.Obviously this is not for the kiddies and comes as close to an ""X"" rating as any ""R"" movie you'll ever see.

This one is clearly not for the kiddies, and those who have been raped in the past should not watch this one alone as it is very realistic.Having said this, I have three words: watch this movie.Hillary Swank is brilliant in her portrayal of Brandon Teena, a female to male transgendered person who was raped and murdered in Nebraska in 1993.  In fact, her performance was so good that I thought a man protrayed Brandon Teena, or at least an actual female to male transsexual who was also a good actor.  Her performance is accurate and powerful, and clearly she had done some research into the role.For those not familiar with the story, I can tell you it is fairly accurately portrayed in every detail.  Brandon Teena was born Teena Brandon.  In 1993, Brandon Teena was living in with Lana Tisdel, when he was exposed as having been born female by John Lotter and Marvin Nissen, who stripped him in front of Lana.  They then took Brandon Teena outside, drove for a distance, and repeatedly beat and raped him.When Brandon Teena reported the rape to law enforcement, they were insulting and hostile.  Eventually, the arrested Lotter and Nissen, but they were quickly released despite the violent nature of their crimes.

As it turns out, I think I held this film to much higher standards than usual and found  some problematic areas.That said, I still find Boys Don't Cry to be a  powerful, touching, and harrowing story of misunderstanding, ignorance, and  love, with one of the most powerfully Quixotic characters to have graced  the screen in ages.  Hilary Swank and director Kimberly Peirce chose the  right approach by exploring thoroughly the joy Brandon experiences at  his/her own transformation, making the tragedy at the end a moving  experience.  Dramatically the film sometimes gets too heavy-handed and it  is the light-fingered moments (Chloe Sevigny's Lana lying in bed with  girlfriends thinking back to her first seduction by Brandon; Lana and  Brandon sharing the excitement of moving away; Brandon watching Lana sing  karaoke) that really shine.The film does show off technically, with a  flashy editing style, unsubtle use of music and, again, moments that are  almost delirious in their heavy-handed presentation of events and  characters.

All I really knew going in was it was a very good and very intense movie. This is by far the most violent film I've ever ""viewed"" - by that I mean couldn't stop watching but had to fast forward through the most violent of parts. I have no idea how this film is not NC 17. By all standards, this is an adult movie. Though the sex/violence in the film was not gratuitous. It was appropriate and needed to tell the story.This film is a tragic romance/drama about 20 year old Brandon who is tough, thrill seeking, brave, nurturing, beautiful, and sweet. Brandon lives in a girls body and fully identifies as being a boy with no parents, no job, no money, and no way to transform the exterior self to match the internal perception. And instead resorts to breast binding and rolled socks in the pants. The film starts out with Brandon living with an older relative who loves and is concerned about Brandon, but is fed up and kicks Brandon out, after Brandon runs into the house locks the door, and hits the floor, with an angry gang of young men chasing closely behind screaming threats and breaking windows. All the while Brandon is grinning at the thrill of it. The tension in this film starts out high, then escalates throughout.Brandon ends up going to a bar, meets a girl, and bonds with her two male companions over a bar fight. Brandon latches onto the trio, tags along to their small town a hundred miles away, and happily becomes a part of their highly dysfunctional households. This is the first time Brandon, who is rather naive and lacks self preservation skills, has ventured from his home town of Lincoln, Nebraska. One of the men, John, a thrill-seeker like Brandon, but also an unstable drug addict with bouts of violence, takes Brandon under his wing as a kind of mascot. When Brandon becomes enamored with Lana, who John is extremely possessive about, things get complicated. And when Brandon's many deceptions are uncovered, ugly.This film was perfectly cast, with superb performances all around. The actresses portraying the two main characters in this film (Hillary Swank as Brandon and Chloe Sevigny as Lana) were academy award winners/nominees. Huge amounts of research and filming technique went into this film (amazing cinematography) which is worth checking out after watching the film.Post Script - One small issue with the film was that there was a scene in which Lana was present and her presence didn't seem to make sense. I assumed it must have been what actually happened, but later found she was in fact not there at that time.

Just knowing that someone had lived this life, and had to be subjected to the torture and humiliation is so sad and disturbing.  There are some scenes that are very disturbing, and I started to feel as  though Hilary Swank was really Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon.  She really got  into her role, and did an outstanding job!  She was the best actress of the  year in my book , as well as OSCARS.  The other actors were also very  good. Chloe Sevigny is one of the great up and coming female actresses out  there. I think you have to be in the right mood to sit down and watch this  movie.  Or make sure you rent something funny/cute to watch after it to  help get your mind off the subject matter. It's a very sad display of how  ignorant people can be. Although i did find this movie quite fascinating,  there were a couple of holes to it. 1.  It's never really explained why  Teena wants to be a man in the first place.  I guess you have to know the  whole true story, and have watched the documentary on the real Teena  Brandon.  2.  How could these people not have known it was really a woman  and not a man?  This really bothered me, Hilary Swank was very convincing  but those so called friends must have been high every time they saw her to  not know that it was really a girl.

517952,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CWN2,"""flickjunkie""","[5, 5]","This is a poignant and powerful film.  It is the true story of Teena Brandon, a young woman who is in the throes of a sexual identity crisis.  She cuts her hair and dresses like a man to see if she can pass for one.  What starts out as an experiment turns into a full fledged alter ego as she  is accepted as a man by a group she meets in a bar.  The story follows the  group's escapades, including Brandon's love affair with Lana, who falls in  love with Brandon, thinking she's a man.  It culminates with the discovery  that Brandon is actually a woman with a dramatic confrontation in the  finale.This is film noir at it's finest.  A lot of people think that  this is a story about courage and lesbianism but it is really about  neither.  It is about the search for identity; not just sexual identity but  the search for a deeper self .  All the characters in this film were lost  and confused, but Brandon was the only one who realized it of herself.  The  rest were basically playing out their despondent lives trying not to think  of who or what they were.  Here was a person they loved and accepted, but  who turned out to be the most heinous of deviants as defined by their own  prejudices and fears. This is why they were so fundamentally shaken upon  the revelation of Brandon's true identity.  It left them to confront their  own flimsy identities.  They were left with no respite from the emotional  vortex. Brandon presented a terrifying threat to the way they viewed  themselves.  They were compelled to change who they were or hate someone  they had grown to love.This film was also about obsession.  Brandon  takes extraordinary risks to live the male role, not out of courage, but  out of an obsession to know and understand it, and to see if she can find  comfort and a sense of belonging.  Likewise, writer/director Kimberly  Peirce had been obsessed with this story and researched it for five years  before finally making the film.  Obsession generally leads to one of two  places: greatness or death.  For Peirce, at least for the moment, it has  lead to greatness in the production of this film.Strictly from a  technical directorial standpoint there was nothing special here.  The  lighting was amateurish, the shots were mostly mundane. The sets and  locations were realistically trashy, but it is a lot easier to create  realistic trash than realistic elegance.  Peirce also bogs the film down  occasionally with excessive character development.  However, Peirce  captures in the story and the filming, the essence of rural lower class  crudenes, bigotry and hatred and fear.  It is the raw emotion that reaches  out and grabs us.  Her lens brought into sharp focus the base reality of  inescapable despair and deluded hope.  Reality often has fangs, and Peirce  was undaunted in showing them and then ripping us to shreds.As to Hilary  Swank, I can only add one more rose to the bouquet of praise that has been  heaped on her.  If there was any courage in this story, it was the courage  of Swank to take such a complex and disturbing role.  The subtlety of her  performance was astounding.  She needed not just to be a woman playing a  man.  She needed to be a woman playing a woman playing a man, trying to  look convincing yet insecure and unsure of how she was being perceived by  the other characters.  When in character, her many skillful lapses into  moments of femininity, only to snap back into masculinity were masterfully  done.  For Swank, this was a meteoric rise from obscurity.  It remains to  be seen if it was just the perfect alignment of actor and role, or  something more.  I hope for the latter and look forward to seeing her next  project.Greatly obscured by Swankmania, was the performance by Chloe  Sevigny as Lana, Brandon's love interest.  She gave an outstanding  performance in another extraordinarily difficult role.  Her conflict over  the implications of her sexual and emotional feelings for Brandon were  sensitively and delicately portrayed.  She played the part with a tentative  eagerness, just as one would expect of someone whose sexual identity had  been thrown into upheaval.  It was also no easy career choice to be cast in  a role with so many explicit sexual scenes with another woman.This film  was stark reality with no holds barred.  The filmmaking was technically  unsophisticated (and I'm usually a real stickler about that), but I rated  it a 9/10 on pure emotional power.  This film is not for you if you are  offended by lesbianism, graphic violence or profanity.  But if you are not  intimidated by the naked reality of the darker side of life, this is a film  you must experience.",5,Disturbing and powerful film,957571200,"05 6, 2000",2000,4659,"['poignant', 'powerful', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'throes', 'sexual', 'identity', 'crisis', 'hair', 'dresses', 'man', 'see', 'can', 'pass', 'one', 'What', 'out', 'experiment', 'full', 'fledged', 'alter', 'ego', 'accepted', 'man', 'group', 'bar', 'story', 'group', 'escapades', 'including', 'Brandon', 'love', 'affair', 'Lana', 'who', 'love', 'Brandon', 'thinking', 'man', 'discovery', 'Brandon', 'actually', 'woman', 'dramatic', 'confrontation', 'finale.This', 'film', 'noir', 'finest', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'story', 'courage', 'lesbianism', 'really', 'search', 'identity', 'not', 'just', 'sexual', 'identity', 'search', 'deeper', 'self', 'characters', 'film', 'were', 'lost', 'confused', 'Brandon', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'realized', 'rest', 'were', 'basically', 'playing', 'out', 'despondent', 'trying', 'not', 'think', 'who', 'what', 'were', 'Here', 'was', 'person', 'loved', 'accepted', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'heinous', 'deviants', 'defined', 'own', 'prejudices', 'fears', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'fundamentally', 'shaken', 'revelation', 'Brandon', 'true', 'identity', 'left', 'confront', 'own', 'flimsy', 'identities', 'were', 'left', 'respite', 'emotional', 'vortex', 'Brandon', 'presented', 'terrifying', 'threat', 'way', 'viewed', 'were', 'compelled', 'change', 'who', 'were', 'hate', 'someone', 'had', 'grown', 'love.This', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'obsession', 'Brandon', 'extraordinary', 'risks', 'live', 'male', 'role', 'not', 'courage', 'obsession', 'know', 'understand', 'see', 'can', 'find', 'comfort', 'sense', 'belonging', 'Likewise', 'writer/director', 'Kimberly', 'Peirce', 'had', 'been', 'obsessed', 'story', 'researched', 'five', 'years', 'finally', 'making', 'film', 'Obsession', 'generally', 'one', 'two', 'places', 'greatness', 'death', 'Peirce', 'least', 'moment', 'lead', 'greatness', 'production', 'film.Strictly', 'technical', 'directorial', 'standpoint', 'was', 'nothing', 'special', 'here', 'lighting', 'was', 'amateurish', 'shots', 'were', 'mostly', 'mundane', 'sets', 'locations', 'were', 'realistically', 'trashy', 'lot', 'easier', 'create', 'realistic', 'trash', 'realistic', 'elegance', 'Peirce', 'also', 'bogs', 'film', 'down', 'occasionally', 'excessive', 'character', 'development', 'However', 'Peirce', 'story', 'filming', 'essence', 'rural', 'lower', 'class', 'crudenes', 'bigotry', 'hatred', 'fear', 'raw', 'emotion', 'out', 'grabs', 'lens', 'brought', 'sharp', 'focus', 'base', 'reality', 'inescapable', 'despair', 'deluded', 'hope', 'Reality', 'often', 'fangs', 'Peirce', 'was', 'undaunted', 'showing', 'then', 'ripping', 'shreds.As', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'can', 'only', 'add', 'one', 'more', 'rose', 'bouquet', 'praise', 'been', 'heaped', 'was', 'courage', 'story', 'was', 'courage', 'Swank', 'take', 'such', 'complex', 'disturbing', 'role', 'subtlety', 'performance', 'was', 'astounding', 'needed', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'woman', 'playing', 'man', 'needed', 'be', 'woman', 'playing', 'woman', 'playing', 'man', 'trying', 'look', 'convincing', 'yet', 'insecure', 'unsure', 'how', 'was', 'being', 'perceived', 'other', 'characters', 'When', 'character', 'many', 'skillful', 'lapses', 'moments', 'femininity', 'only', 'snap', 'back', 'masculinity', 'were', 'masterfully', 'done', 'Swank', 'was', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'obscurity', 'be', 'seen', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'alignment', 'actor', 'role', 'something', 'more', 'hope', 'latter', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'next', 'project.Greatly', 'obscured', 'Swankmania', 'was', 'performance', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Lana', 'Brandon', 'love', 'interest', 'gave', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'extraordinarily', 'difficult', 'role', 'conflict', 'implications', 'sexual', 'emotional', 'feelings', 'Brandon', 'were', 'sensitively', 'delicately', 'portrayed', 'played', 'part', 'tentative', 'eagerness', 'just', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'someone', 'sexual', 'identity', 'had', 'been', 'thrown', 'upheaval', 'was', 'also', 'easy', 'career', 'choice', 'be', 'cast', 'role', 'so', 'many', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'woman.This', 'film', 'was', 'stark', 'reality', 'barred', 'filmmaking', 'was', 'technically', 'unsophisticated', ""'m"", 'usually', 'real', 'stickler', 'rated', '9/10', 'pure', 'emotional', 'power', 'film', 'not', 'are', 'offended', 'lesbianism', 'graphic', 'violence', 'profanity', 'are', 'not', 'intimidated', 'naked', 'reality', 'darker', 'side', 'life', 'film', 'must', 'experience']",N/A

517954,AEVS7RZ667VH4,B00003CWN2,Geoff Oldham,"[2, 3]","There's not much to say about this film that hasn't been said in the other reviews, but I do have a few extra comments.Swank's performance really is incredibly brave and convincing. I was surprised not necessarily by how good her performance was, but how brave she was in really throwing herself whole-hog into the role and truly becoming a man. Her performance adds another vast dimension to the movie, particularly as I feel that in her performance alone does the character's motivation come through. You can sense just how exciting it is for her to flirt with becoming free of her gender, even if what she's doing is getting in a bar fight or doing stupid stunts on the back of a pickup. You can sense her euphoria at getting a taste of the experience of being a man. This creates the motivation for her character, as the man she wants to be IS the kind of guy who would get hurt and get into the kind of trouble she does. This is one case where the performance really IS one third of what the film as a whole is and I have no problem with Hilary Swank walking off with the best actress Oscar.I am surprised that so many people at the time said the film was poorly directed. I think that Pierce has definitely watched her share of David Lynch films and uses what she's learned to cast an air of unreality and mythological significance to the events. I thought the sex scene was particularly good, because you see on Lana's face how Brandon is pleasing her in ways that her other boyfriends couldn't possibly. This is much more subtly done than in other lesbian films, where a character would probably have a line like ""well everyone knows that only a woman knows what a woman wants"" or something else-- this film is more powerful because it doesn't preach or be too heavy-handed. It is not without viewpoint, but it handles the matter subtly.It's a little frustrating watching the movie just how stupid Brandon is, but hey, it's a true story and the film makes him out to be stupid and unstable from the start.I'm gay, and as such I found this film's tagline upon release, ""A true story about finding the courage to be yourself,"" entirely disgusting. This is not about finding the courage to be yourself, it's about messed-up people who are at the mercy of forces within themselves that are beyond their control. It's about people who are so undersocialized that they have no way of knowing how to deal with the emotions that they feel. I am so sick of the whole marketing slant of ""Being-gay-is-just-such-a-heartwarming-growing-experience"" that I truly want to vomit. I would like to think that someone out there could credit gay people with enough intelligence to accept that not everything about being gay or lesbian is a wonderful, warm, and affirming experience. I also think a tagline like that trivializes the emotions and experiences of the characters in a film like this. Luckily the film itself is free of such sentimentality.",5,"Well Directed, Incredible Performances",1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,2939,"['not', 'much', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'been', 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'extra', 'comments.Swank', 'performance', 'really', 'incredibly', 'brave', 'convincing', 'was', 'surprised', 'not', 'necessarily', 'how', 'good', 'performance', 'was', 'how', 'brave', 'was', 'really', 'throwing', 'whole-hog', 'role', 'truly', 'becoming', 'man', 'performance', 'vast', 'dimension', 'movie', 'particularly', 'feel', 'performance', 'alone', 'character', 'motivation', 'come', 'can', 'sense', 'just', 'how', 'exciting', 'flirt', 'becoming', 'free', 'gender', 'even', 'what', 'doing', 'getting', 'bar', 'fight', 'doing', 'stupid', 'stunts', 'back', 'pickup', 'can', 'sense', 'euphoria', 'getting', 'taste', 'experience', 'being', 'man', 'motivation', 'character', 'man', 'be', 'IS', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'get', 'hurt', 'get', 'kind', 'trouble', 'one', 'case', 'where', 'performance', 'really', 'one', 'third', 'what', 'film', 'whole', 'have', 'problem', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'walking', 'off', 'best', 'actress', 'Oscar.I', 'am', 'surprised', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'time', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'poorly', 'directed', 'think', 'Pierce', 'definitely', 'watched', 'share', 'David', 'Lynch', 'films', 'what', 'learned', 'cast', 'air', 'unreality', 'mythological', 'significance', 'events', 'thought', 'sex', 'scene', 'was', 'particularly', 'good', 'see', 'Lana', 'face', 'how', 'Brandon', 'pleasing', 'ways', 'other', 'boyfriends', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'much', 'more', 'subtly', 'done', 'other', 'lesbian', 'films', 'where', 'character', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'line', 'well', 'everyone', 'only', 'woman', 'what', 'woman', 'something', 'else', 'film', 'more', 'powerful', ""n't"", 'preach', 'be', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'not', 'viewpoint', 'matter', 'subtly.It', 'little', 'frustrating', 'watching', 'movie', 'just', 'how', 'stupid', 'Brandon', 'hey', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'stupid', 'unstable', 'start.I', ""'m"", 'gay', 'such', 'found', 'film', 'tagline', 'release', 'true', 'story', 'finding', 'courage', 'be', 'entirely', 'disgusting', 'not', 'finding', 'courage', 'be', 'messed-up', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'mercy', 'forces', 'are', 'control', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'undersocialized', 'have', 'way', 'knowing', 'how', 'deal', 'emotions', 'feel', 'am', 'so', 'sick', 'whole', 'marketing', 'slant', 'Being-gay-is-just-such-a-heartwarming-growing-experience', 'truly', 'want', 'vomit', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'someone', 'there', 'could', 'credit', 'gay', 'people', 'enough', 'intelligence', 'accept', 'not', 'everything', 'being', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'wonderful', 'warm', 'affirming', 'experience', 'also', 'think', 'tagline', 'emotions', 'experiences', 'characters', 'film', 'Luckily', 'film', 'free', 'such', 'sentimentality']",N/A

I saw a segment of 20/20 about Brandon Teena and decided  to rent the DVD. After viewing the film once, I bought the DVD.  To say  that this film is merely excellent does not do it justice. Director  Kimberly Peirce has captured America's heartland in full detail: the  distubing beauty of its vastness and the ignorance of some of its people.  Whereas Brandon Teena would have been accepted in most large cities, he was  shunned in isolated Nebraska. The uncaring attitude of the local law  enforcement officials enraged me and I I hope the Sheriff of Falls City  realizes that he has Brandon's blood on his hands. I saw Chloe Sevigny in  &quot;AMERICAN PSYCHO&quot; and her performance here is vastly superior.  Hilary Swank has made her Brandon the performance of a lifetime. I can  remember no single scene that haunted me as much as Brandon's rape. Yet Ms.  Swank does not cannonize Brandon but makes him a real character, flaws and  all.

I doubt they'd be going up for the same roles, ever.  But the Academy Awards do at least help ensure that  quality films get made and distributed.  And in the case of &quot;Best  Actress&quot; awards, they often provide some recognition for smaller  independent films, ones that are often woman centered.  Hilary Swank and  Chloe Sevigny are nothing short of astonishing in this profoundly  disturbing film.  They deserve the accolades--and the nominations and  awards--they've received.  Of course, in a just world, there would also be  recognition for the rest of the cast and certainly for director, Kimberly  Peirce.Transgenderism, to use the current vernacular, is not a topic  that Hollywood would normally dare touch in any serious way. It took an  independent director like Peice to see that Brandon Teena's story would be  told in a compassionate, largely unsentimental way. She creates a bleak  vision of the rural Midwest as the proverbial &quot;cultural  wasteland,&quot; but its residents are granted their humanity and their  dignity.Let's hope that Swank doesn't suffer from Oscar backlash and  that she continues to find challenging roles that display her range. From  what I've seen of Sevigny's work, she has already established herself as  versatile, important young actress.

At least, this is apparent in the movie, and neglect may not be true to Teena Brandon's real life. I'm sure there were people who loved her, but none of them were shown in this movie. She was set in a place where she was alone much of the time, living in a small home or trailer with her brother. It's sad to see neglect in so many people who are gay, though. I would say most really have heart. I have gone through neglect with my family or felt that they don't care enough or don't know how to care, and there is sometimes a sense of abandonment. We choose to leave; after some time we finally meet trouble and perhaps return to them. Then it's like they don't know us. No one knows us. And ""us"" I mean all of us. We're all in that situation, it seems. This movie displays what we are after neglect, searching for people who will fill the gap. To see this movie, you may agree that the characters are actually still children who have all felt neglect and are at the bottom of it all, working jobs they don't like. I really liked Hilary Swank in this. It was a very daring person to play. These people really knew what they were doing. I admire the efforts of the director as well, to see time pass in fast forward with music in Nebraska. The color and mood of the whole movie works to display Nebraska as desolate and sparse and superficial where the lead character is opposite of that with a lot of heart and curiosity leading her to trouble, which I also display in my writing. I'm from Nebraska and wrote a novel set there, which I intended to write to see it as a movie. I go by the author name Ian Bradley. Still not published, though.

517960,A3D8AYKFFAOIMO,B00003CWN2,"I Love Amazon.com ""I Love Amazon.com""","[0, 1]","This is a very important movie and I recommend it to anyone (over 18 only because of the violence and sexuality).The true story of Teena Brandon, ""Boys Don't Cry"" will make you sick, sad, and intrigued at the same time.  Having grown up in a small rural town full of tunnel-visioned people, I can relate with the movie from the stand point of being different and sticking out like a sore thumb.Yes, this film has been ""Hollywood-ized"", but the true story it is based upon has been told without apology or disclaimer. Because it is an independent film, it doesn't have the big-budget look, and it really doesn't need it.  The story gets told honestly, and with a story like this, it wouldn't have been right any other way.Hillary Swank deserved her Oscar for this, and you will believe her portrayal of a woman trying her darndest to be a guy.  Many times, I forgot that she was a woman, but not in a campy, impersonator-type way.  She looks like a young, baby-faced boy/man, and has the mannerisms, look, and lingo down.This is a tragic tale and Teena Brandon was definitely a messed-up individual, however, her gender-identity really takes a back seat to her up-bringing, her choice of friends, her habitual lying, and troubles with the law.  Because of the combination, she is ignored by her family and the legal-system; the two entities anyone should be been able to count on.  In the end, these are the things that kill her - the two morons who pull the trigger are just the vehicle.  Still, you will end up hating the killers and see their backwards, red-necked male-macho baloney for what it is way before the movie heats up.This is more than just a transgender movie, it is a complex tale that includes a cast of characters you have probably known once or twice in your life.  And that, hopefully, will make you think about and compel you to see this movie more than once.

517961,A2R3FDDGZG7K9E,B00003CWN2,I. Rodriguez,"[23, 23]","Having just seen the film, I have to say &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; is one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. Swank's performance could have gone horribly wrong, and yet she kept the tour de force up for the entire  two hours of this mesmerizing film. What I liked about it was:1. The  direction: Remember, this is a first film. Kimberly Pierce had worked five  years to bring her script to the screen, and does so in a refreshing,  UNPRETENTIOUS way I really related to. Like &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and  &quot;Badlands&quot; she focused on the life of these midwestern characters  in such a genuine way that I wouldn't be surprised how people might not be  blown away by it. In fact, it is a SUBTLE approach that I find more  effective in films, I'm all for special effects as in &quot;The  Matrix&quot; and the aesthetic elements of say, &quot;American  Beauty,&quot; but Pierce's ear for dialogue and her vision of Falls City as  this vast wasteland where young people don't have much of a future and are  filled up with frustrations was inspiring. She told a HUMAN INTEREST STORY  against BIGOTRY in such a DECENT way that even the VILLAINS came out as  being all too human. The narrative structure, while not flashy, was quite  complex and hard to get away with. There was a flow to the film that gave  it the heart that was needed to accurately represent the characters. It's a  SHAME that Pierce fell to the wayside in the awards season--simplicity  seems to be overlooked because most people don't realize that attaining  such an ability is the hardest thing in the world.2. The acting: Hilary  WAS a boy. Her movements, her countenace, everything. Our complicity with  her character made me realize just how strong a performance she gave. Every  second, in her face, I could see the fear of being found out. All the  complexities of Brandon Teena came alive with a movement of the lips or  with a certain look. The need to please everyone while at the same time  compensating her mere existence with lies and deceit. It is a very  demanding role that she pulled off magnificently. And more importantly, it  is a new kind of role. I've seen the controlling/hysterical woman Annette  Bening played (Faye Dunaway in &quot;Network&quot; to name one). But in the  type of role Swank had to play she had little to work with (Jaye Davidson's  Dil in &quot;The Crying Game&quot; comes to mind) and yet she avoided  becoming a pitiful figure, and managed to give Brandon an inner beauty that  wasn't preachy or contrived.  CHLOE SEVIGNY was incredible. As a matter of  fact, she impressed me even more than Swank. It is a subtle, powerful  performance that also rises above any other &quot;girlfriend&quot; type  role I have ever seen. She endowes Lana with the ability to really love and  care for Brandon and is truly the ray of hope in an otherwise dark movie.  PETER SASGAARD is also a stand out as John Lotter, because he was so human.  An insecure, childish, violent man who is also capable of showing a lot of  affection for his daughter. The undercurrents of BRENDAN SAXTON III's  performance are also worth mentioning simply because  it shows without a  lot of words the confusion he must have felt when he found himself  attracted to this &quot;guy.&quot;  There are so many layers to this film  that I could go on and on praising it. Of course I have one problem with  it:1. THE FACTS: Like &quot;The Insider,&quot; &quot;The  Hurricane,&quot; and a million other films, BDC plays with the facts.  Another person was murdered in that house, an African American male. I feel  that for the film's sake, it was VITAL to focus on the Lana/Brandon  relationship, but being familiar with the case, I thought they could have  handled the misrepresentation of the third victim better.In short, it  was an amazing movie. Best one I've seen since &quot;Election.&quot; But  unlike &quot;Election,&quot; it doesn't deal with already explored themes.  This is unexplored territory Ms. Pierce was going into, and she came  out--as far as I'm concerned--as an extremely promising filmmaker who will  hopefully continue to tell socially relevant stories in this f&amp;#*ed up  world in which baseball fans give a standing ovation to a bigott and even  wear t-shirts that say &quot;JOHN ROCKER FOR PRESIDENT&quot;",5,Heart Shattering Masterpiece,956102400,"04 19, 2000",2000,4318,"['Having', 'just', 'seen', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'quot', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Swank', 'performance', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'yet', 'kept', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'up', 'entire', 'two', 'hours', 'mesmerizing', 'film', 'What', 'liked', 'direction', 'Remember', 'first', 'film', 'Kimberly', 'Pierce', 'had', 'worked', 'five', 'years', 'bring', 'script', 'screen', 'so', 'refreshing', 'UNPRETENTIOUS', 'way', 'really', 'related', 'quot', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'quot', 'quot', 'Badlands', 'quot', 'focused', 'life', 'midwestern', 'characters', 'such', 'genuine', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'fact', 'SUBTLE', 'approach', 'find', 'more', 'effective', 'films', ""'m"", 'special', 'effects', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'aesthetic', 'elements', 'say', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'Pierce', 'ear', 'dialogue', 'vision', 'Falls', 'City', 'vast', 'wasteland', 'where', 'young', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'future', 'are', 'filled', 'up', 'frustrations', 'was', 'inspiring', 'told', 'HUMAN', 'INTEREST', 'STORY', 'BIGOTRY', 'such', 'DECENT', 'way', 'even', 'VILLAINS', 'came', 'out', 'being', 'too', 'human', 'narrative', 'structure', 'not', 'flashy', 'was', 'quite', 'complex', 'hard', 'get', 'away', 'was', 'flow', 'film', 'gave', 'heart', 'was', 'needed', 'accurately', 'represent', 'characters', 'SHAME', 'Pierce', 'fell', 'wayside', 'awards', 'season', 'simplicity', 'be', 'overlooked', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'attaining', 'ability', 'hardest', 'thing', 'world.2', 'acting', 'Hilary', 'WAS', 'boy', 'movements', 'countenace', 'everything', 'complicity', 'character', 'made', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'strong', 'performance', 'gave', 'Every', 'second', 'face', 'could', 'see', 'fear', 'being', 'found', 'out', 'complexities', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'came', 'alive', 'movement', 'lips', 'certain', 'look', 'need', 'please', 'everyone', 'same', 'time', 'compensating', 'mere', 'existence', 'lies', 'deceit', 'very', 'demanding', 'role', 'pulled', 'off', 'magnificently', 'more', 'importantly', 'new', 'kind', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'controlling/hysterical', 'woman', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'played', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'quot', 'Network', 'quot', 'name', 'one', 'type', 'role', 'Swank', 'had', 'play', 'had', 'little', 'work', 'Jaye', 'Davidson', 'Dil', 'quot', 'Crying', 'Game', 'quot', 'mind', 'yet', 'avoided', 'becoming', 'pitiful', 'figure', 'managed', 'give', 'Brandon', 'inner', 'beauty', 'was', ""n't"", 'preachy', 'contrived', 'CHLOE', 'SEVIGNY', 'was', 'incredible', 'matter', 'fact', 'impressed', 'even', 'more', 'Swank', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'performance', 'also', 'other', 'quot', 'quot', 'type', 'role', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Lana', 'ability', 'really', 'love', 'care', 'Brandon', 'truly', 'ray', 'hope', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'movie', 'PETER', 'SASGAARD', 'also', 'stand', 'out', 'John', 'Lotter', 'was', 'so', 'human', 'insecure', 'childish', 'violent', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'capable', 'showing', 'lot', 'affection', 'daughter', 'undercurrents', 'BRENDAN', 'SAXTON', 'III', 'performance', 'are', 'also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'simply', 'lot', 'words', 'confusion', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'when', 'found', 'attracted', 'quot', 'quot', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'film', 'could', 'go', 'praising', 'course', 'have', 'one', 'problem', 'it:1', 'FACTS', 'quot', 'Insider', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hurricane', 'quot', 'million', 'other', 'films', 'BDC', 'facts', 'person', 'was', 'murdered', 'house', 'African', 'American', 'male', 'feel', 'film', 'sake', 'was', 'VITAL', 'focus', 'Lana/Brandon', 'relationship', 'being', 'familiar', 'case', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'misrepresentation', 'third', 'victim', 'better.In', 'short', 'was', 'amazing', 'movie', 'Best', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quot', 'Election.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Election', 'quot', ""n't"", 'deal', 'already', 'explored', 'themes', 'unexplored', 'territory', 'Ms.', 'Pierce', 'was', 'going', 'came', 'out', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'extremely', 'promising', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'will', 'hopefully', 'continue', 'tell', 'socially', 'relevant', 'stories', 'f', 'amp', '*ed', 'up', 'world', 'baseball', 'fans', 'give', 'standing', 'ovation', 'bigott', 'even', 'wear', 't-shirts', 'say', 'quot', 'JOHN', 'ROCKER', 'FOR', 'PRESIDENT', 'quot']",N/A

517963,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00003CWN2,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 4]","A very disquieting film that tells a story that seems so unreal that we need to discover, at the very end of it, the fate of the protagonists to believe it is a true story. It is first of all a story about the gender identity of a girl, Teena Brandon, who sees herself as a boy and wants to behave as one, to be one. She manages to go through it all and falls in love with a girl who falls in love with her too, thinking she is a boy. So far so good. But what will happen when her real identity comes out? And that is the drama. The brothers or local boys of the neighborhood of the girl who has fallen in love with Teena Brandon decide to take justice in their own hands. First they teach a lesson to that Teena and rape her ruthlessly. But this ends up in the sheriff's office and that is only the beginning of the end. Then the two boys decide to expedite real justice and they kill Teena along with another girl, and mother, that happens to be there at the wrong moment with her baby. The two culprits will be taken to court, tried, convicted and sentenced. But what can we do with such a tragedy? How can it be possible in our modern world that a gender crisis in the mind of a girl may cause such disorder among the people around her? How come the boys react so violently whereas the girls or even older women seem to be a lot more tolerant? What makes such a gender crisis so dramatic? There is no real answer and simple male bigotry is not enough to explain such events. Is malehood such a privilege, such an unsharable dignity that any woman who will desire to assume some of it for herself will turn the surrounding men into criminals? We are dealing here with sex or gender fetishism. But how come it is stronger among men than among women? Or would it be the same in reverse if a boy tried to assume a female identity? I am not sure. Men must feel particularly menaced by the gender wavering of a female who could thus penetrate the secret citadel of malehood without being a member of the brotherhood. Is it really an old story? Definitely not. It could happen again any time, and I would even say it does happen all the time here or there, openly but probably most of the time unknown of anyone because self-censored by the ""culprit"" of such wavering.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",5,"Bigotry or Fetishism are ""good"" excuses !",1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,2352,"['very', 'disquieting', 'film', 'story', 'so', 'unreal', 'need', 'discover', 'very', 'end', 'fate', 'protagonists', 'believe', 'true', 'story', 'first', 'story', 'gender', 'identity', 'girl', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'who', 'boy', 'behave', 'one', 'be', 'one', 'go', 'falls', 'love', 'girl', 'who', 'love', 'too', 'thinking', 'boy', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'real', 'identity', 'out', 'drama', 'brothers', 'local', 'boys', 'neighborhood', 'girl', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'decide', 'take', 'justice', 'own', 'hands', 'First', 'teach', 'lesson', 'Teena', 'rape', 'ruthlessly', 'up', 'sheriff', 'office', 'only', 'beginning', 'end', 'Then', 'two', 'boys', 'decide', 'expedite', 'real', 'justice', 'kill', 'Teena', 'girl', 'mother', 'be', 'there', 'wrong', 'moment', 'baby', 'two', 'culprits', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'court', 'tried', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'tragedy', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'possible', 'modern', 'world', 'gender', 'crisis', 'mind', 'girl', 'may', 'cause', 'such', 'disorder', 'people', 'How', 'come', 'boys', 'react', 'so', 'violently', 'girls', 'even', 'older', 'women', 'seem', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'tolerant', 'What', 'gender', 'crisis', 'so', 'dramatic', 'real', 'answer', 'simple', 'male', 'bigotry', 'not', 'enough', 'explain', 'such', 'events', 'malehood', 'such', 'privilege', 'unsharable', 'dignity', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'desire', 'assume', 'will', 'turn', 'surrounding', 'men', 'criminals', 'are', 'dealing', 'here', 'sex', 'gender', 'fetishism', 'how', 'come', 'stronger', 'men', 'women', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'reverse', 'boy', 'tried', 'assume', 'female', 'identity', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'Men', 'must', 'feel', 'particularly', 'menaced', 'gender', 'wavering', 'female', 'who', 'could', 'thus', 'penetrate', 'secret', 'citadel', 'malehood', 'being', 'member', 'brotherhood', 'really', 'old', 'story', 'Definitely', 'not', 'could', 'happen', 'again', 'time', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'happen', 'time', 'here', 'there', 'openly', 'probably', 'most', 'time', 'unknown', 'anyone', 'self-censored', 'culprit', 'such', 'wavering.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne']",N/A

Lewis,"[1, 3]","Hilary Swank won a much-deserved Oscar for her portrayal here of Teena Rae Brandon, a young woman living with gender dysphoria, who for the last years of her life lived as a man under the name of Brandon Teena before she was brutally murdered by two young men. The performance of Swank and other actors in this film is compelling. This film certainly humanizes the complex and widely misunderstood plight of woman and men like Teena Brandon who are forced to live not only with vilification and threats from many around them, but who must ever minute of every day confront the reality that their own bodies are a living mockery of how they conceptualize themselves and their place in the world. If art is a creative endeavor that enables someone to come closer to the inner world and experiences of another, than this is indeed one of the rarest things to come out of Hollywood -- a real piece of art.As evident from many of the reviews here, this film a has become an occasion for polemics and gender identity politics among some, for displays of misinformation and confusion among others, and for both by yet others. But one need not accept any of the usual claims about issues of gender identity and gender dysphoria to relate to the human tragedy behind Teena Brandon's life and death as depicted in ""Boys Don't Cry."" Remember that the classic definition of tragedy is not merely the unfolding of a sad event; it is the inevitability of disappointment, defeat and ultimately death as innate parts of the human experience that none of us can avoid.

Where have I been that I haven't seen it until now?Here, Swank plays Teena Brandon, a 21-year old woman with female genitalia but the sexual inclinations of a male. Ultimately, she'd like a sex change. In the meantime, she cuts her hair short, wraps up her breasts, pads the crotch of her jeans, renames herself Brandon Teena, and sets out to pick-up chicks. Now, in my corner of the world - Southern California - one could pull this off with panache. Trouble is, Brandon lives in Nebraska, and she eventually runs afoul of a couple of good ol' boys, John (Peter Sarsgaard) and Tom (Brandon Sexton), the former being the erstwhile boyfriend of Lana (Chloe Sevigny), the girl with whom Brandon develops a love relationship. The violence John and Tom eventually visit upon Brandon/Teena gives your average bigot a bad name, and reminds me why Nebraska is Flyover Country, especially when it's not pigskin season and the locals don't have Cornhusker football to keep them occupied. (Ok, ok. I admit I'm being unfair to Nebraska. After all, I'm not from Oklahoma and a Sooner fan.)Swank's role in BOYS DON'T CRY is, in many ways, grittier and incorporates more extremes of emotion than that in MILLION DOLLAR BABY. At times, I winced and slowly sunk down in my seat, much as I did as I watched Charlize Theron's bravura performance in MONSTER, and MILLION DOLLAR BABY never elicited that reaction. Here, Hilary elevates what might otherwise be a 3 or 4-star soap opera about the lives of trailer trash to 5-star heights.The sad part is that BOYS DON'T CRY is based on a true story. At the time the film was released, the real-life John and Tom were serving prison sentences. As for Teena, well, it's a shame she didn't live in a more tolerant, cosmopolitan environment.

Perez ""Jose""","[5, 7]","&quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; is one of those movies that can either leave you miserable and exhausted so that all you want to do is cry, or inspired and energized to go back out into the world and make a difference.  In both cases, it succeeds at being a gritty, realistic indictment on a society that places the external and materialistic aspects of life above the inner spirit we all have within us.  In doing so, it exposes the raw truth about a culture that has grown to hate, isnpired in part by the horrors we witness both at home, and at the movies.Hilary Swank is luminous in an Oscar winning performance that not only transcends gender but also identity.  Her chilling Brandon Teena, raped, abused, taunted and despised for celebrating his own individuality and inner-beingness, is unforgettable. Chole Sivegny as the girl he charms with swagger and vulnerability, lends realism to an unflattering role that in someone else's hands could have been laughable.  These star-crossed, ill-fated lovers ooze true love, far more than most of today's movie duos.As successful as the actors are in realizing their real life counterparts, the story, and its plot elements - all based on actual events - never fully do it justice.  At times you feel you're watching a terrific documentary, and then you're transported to a Lifetime-television-for-women-movie-of-the-week.  And if it's a terrific documentary you desire, rent or own the actual &quot;Brandon Teena Story&quot; which features an eerie soundtrack of the real Teena Brandon answering a detective's questions.The magic of this film is in the message, and ultimately, &quot;Boys DOn't Cry&quot; succeeds as an expose on the hatred our society has imparted on those who are different, or outside the norm.  In doing so, it serves as a much needed testament for embracing our differences, celebrating our unique characteristics, and caring less about what others think of us and more about how we can change the world.Brandon Teena was no martyr, and certainly not a saint.  But, in his short life, he made a difference by being who he was, and by allowing us a glimpse inside a full, rich heart.  This film accomplishes many things on many levels, but nothing startles as much as realizing that we all have our secrets, longings, and passions though few of us ever have the courage to make them our reality, like Brandon Teena briefly did.  Given the unprecedented events of September 11th and its aftermath, Brandon served notice years ago that society's hatreds had gone too far.

It's got a director we've never heard of, a bunch of new actors and a story about a sexual identity crisis. It doesn't sound very appealing. But, what cinema-goers around the world have got out of this little masterpiece is much more than you'd expect, and Boys Don't Cry has quickly become one of the best independent films of the `90's.Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank) is the popular new guy in a tiny Nebraska town. He hangs out with the guys, drinking, cussing, and bumper surfing, and he charms the young women, who've never met a more sensitive and considerate young man. Life is good for Brandon, now that he's one of the guys and dating hometown beauty Lana Tisdel (Chloe Sevigny). However, he's forgotten to mention one important detail. It's not that he's wanted in another town for GTA and other assorted crimes, but that Brandon Teena is actually a woman named Teena Brandon. When Brandon's best friends make this discovery, his life eventually is ripped apart by betrayal, humiliation, rape, and murder.This moving and unexpected story is bought to life by a marvellous script by Kimberley Pierce and Andy Bienen; all the scenes are worth watching and all the dialogue is excellently thought-out. Pierce, who also directs, shows excellent potential, the rape scene in particular captures her brilliance and taut direction. The performances are all masterful; Hilary Swank who wins a well-deserved Oscar for her role as Brandon Teena; Chloe Sevigny who was nominated for an Oscar and should've won, her performance burns in the memory. Also some acting and small efforts that went unnoticed in Boys Don't Cry make it more worth watching, including Peter Sarsgaard's portrayal of the horribly nice-guy-turned bad John Lotter and also Nathan Larson for his haunting score.Groundbreaking performances, immaculate direction and a stunningly brutal script make Boys Don't Cry an unmissable first feature.",5,A moving independent film.,984787200,"03 17, 2001",2001,1955,"['Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'CryScore', '91/100Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'huh', 'got', 'director', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'bunch', 'new', 'actors', 'story', 'sexual', 'identity', 'crisis', ""n't"", 'sound', 'very', 'appealing', 'what', 'cinema-goers', 'world', 'have', 'got', 'little', 'masterpiece', 'much', 'more', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'quickly', 'become', 'one', 'best', 'independent', 'films', ""90's.Brandon"", 'Teena', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'popular', 'new', 'guy', 'tiny', 'Nebraska', 'town', 'out', 'guys', 'drinking', 'cussing', 'surfing', 'young', 'women', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met', 'more', 'sensitive', 'considerate', 'young', 'man', 'Life', 'good', 'Brandon', 'now', 'one', 'guys', 'dating', 'hometown', 'beauty', 'Lana', 'Tisdel', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'However', 'forgotten', 'mention', 'one', 'important', 'detail', 'not', 'wanted', 'town', 'GTA', 'other', 'assorted', 'crimes', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'actually', 'woman', 'named', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'When', 'Brandon', 'best', 'friends', 'make', 'discovery', 'life', 'eventually', 'ripped', 'apart', 'betrayal', 'humiliation', 'rape', 'murder.This', 'moving', 'unexpected', 'story', 'bought', 'life', 'marvellous', 'script', 'Kimberley', 'Pierce', 'Andy', 'Bienen', 'scenes', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'dialogue', 'excellently', 'thought-out', 'Pierce', 'who', 'also', 'excellent', 'potential', 'rape', 'scene', 'particular', 'captures', 'brilliance', 'taut', 'direction', 'performances', 'are', 'masterful', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'who', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'should', ""'ve"", 'won', 'performance', 'burns', 'memory', 'Also', 'acting', 'small', 'efforts', 'went', 'unnoticed', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'make', 'more', 'worth', 'watching', 'including', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'portrayal', 'horribly', 'nice-guy-turned', 'bad', 'John', 'Lotter', 'also', 'Nathan', 'Larson', 'haunting', 'score.Groundbreaking', 'performances', 'immaculate', 'direction', 'stunningly', 'brutal', 'script', 'make', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'unmissable', 'first', 'feature']",N/A

517987,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00003CWN2,Kenji Fujishima,"[6, 8]","I am giving Kimberly Peirce's BOYS DON'T CRY four stars because, simply looking at it as a piece of filmmaking, it is startlingly effective. But I must also admit that, after seeing this movie, I was a little uneasy about the filmmakers' approach to this based-on-real-life story, one that I think to some extent simplifies and conventionalizes what could have been truly disturbing material.There is no doubt that BOYS DON'T CRY is acted and directed with great sensitivity and realism. This one of the most vivid depictions of humdrum small-town life I have seen; you really feel as if you are in Falls City, Nebraska, among its wide open spaces and bored citizens. And the performances are excellent. Hilary Swank, of course, won an Oscar for her depiction of Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena, and it is a sympathetic, totally involving performance, one that beautifully conveys the joy she takes in being a male, and her desperation as her ruse threatens to fall apart. The other performances are no less worthy, though, particularly Chloe Sevigny's as small-town dreamer Lana Tisdel, and Peter Sarsgaard's as John Lotter, who will eventually turn on Brandon. And, as a whole, it must be said that BOYS DON'T CRY is effectively tragic and haunting, without ever lapsing into heavy-handed sentimentality.And yet, there is something about the movie that strikes me as false. I think that, to some degree, Peirce has simplified this fascinating, unsettling story, and turned it into a modern day operatic tragedy (in its own down-to-earth way). She has turned the real-life story into a rather more conventional tale about intolerance---Teena Brandon is tortured and then murdered for daring to be something she is not---and thereby spurned any serious attempts at genuine insight into why Teena Brandon did what she did. What made her feel more comfortable acting like a man, for instance? We never really know; the movie never truly bothers to explain, except by dropping vague hints about a ""sexual identity crisis."" Instead, Peirce is simply content to tell a story that, at heart, is about how a Love That Never Dies---the relationship between Brandon and Lana (whose loyalty to Brandon I personally found slightly unconvincing, as true as it may be)---can triumph over the rage of a bunch of small-town bigots. What the film lacks, I think, is the willingness to go deeper into its material. On its own terms, the movie is effectively tragic and haunting; but, if Peirce was more willing to dig deeper into its characters, and not settle for simplification and conventionality, BOYS DON'T CRY could have been truly disturbing and thought-provoking rather than merely sad.Still, I don't want to sell this movie too short. This is basically a good movie, one that is realistic, well-made, and superbly acted. For real insight into Teena Brandon, you will have to look elsewhere; but what BOYS DON'T CRY lacks in nuance, it makes up for in heartbreaking big gestures.

This is not because we all  identify with someone wanting to change their gender, but because we  identify with her struggle to be accepted.  We all wear masks.  Is anyone  totally truthful to their friends or for that matter even theirself.  We  fell for Swanks character because we see her naivety.  She thinks that  everything will be alright, and that she can forever live in her deception.  The more she does manage to fit in the more we cringe because the  reckoning will be that much more destructive.  I realize that this is based  on a true story, but I did have the thought that if the situation had been  reverse and a man had been impersonating a woman the film would have been  even more courageous.  I do not consider this much of a fault however.  The  only fault that I could see were the several scenes where time elapsed  photography was used (the night sky and the factory).  The shots in and of  themselves were great, but they did not blend well with the realism set up  by the location and acting.  Why distract from what is so hard to create in  the first place?  This is possibly the best all around acting job by a cast  in film.  I just hope in my excitement over this film I have not overated  it.

Brandon was brutally murdered in 1993. Hilary Swank does a phenomenal and Oscar-winning job of recreating the end of Brandon's life.This is a dark, and profoundly distressing film. Even if Brandon's life story were not known, it could be surmised by this brief recitation of facts: A young transgendered girl is born in Lincoln, Nebraska, and upon leaving home sets out for---an insular rural town.The real tragedy of Brandon's life is that Brandon might have found far more acceptance in an anonymous large city, like Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Miami, or even Chicago. Instead, Brandon exhibited a tendency toward poor choices (including busts for check fraud); settling in a one-stoplight town whose younger inhabitants had the limited horizons brought on by chronic unemployment, heavy drinking, petty crime, meth addiction, and violent boredom, was a fatal mistake.Brandon suffered from the same myopia. At one point, Brandon discusses with friends the ambition of owning a trailer park. Despite Brandon's very unorthodox identity, Brandon's imaginative worldview was dreary.  Instead of seeking out similar peers, Brandon chose friends whose natural tendency was to have the narrowest outlook.Truly benighted, two of Brandon's friends raped and beat Brandon when they discovered Brandon's physical identity. After Brandon reported the attack, the two men were brought in for questioning, but were not charged (the local Sheriff referred to Brandon in death several times as ""It""). After their release, they killed Brandon.Swank plays Brandon sympathetically, but not without acknowledging some serious flaws of character. The miserable atmosphere of this film is its own indictment.It is truly troubling that anyone would choose to kill a person like Brandon ""just because"" Brandon was who Brandon was. As sad as the unneccessary death of Brandon was, the environment that spawned such an event is even more sorrowful, especially since it simply doesn't have to be so.",4,"The Short, Tragic Life of Brandon Teena",1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,2061,"['Brandon', 'Teena', 'born', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'was', 'young', 'transgendered', 'female-to-male', 'Brandon', 'was', 'brutally', 'murdered', '1993', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'phenomenal', 'Oscar-winning', 'job', 'recreating', 'end', 'Brandon', 'life.This', 'dark', 'profoundly', 'distressing', 'film', 'Even', 'Brandon', 'life', 'story', 'were', 'not', 'known', 'could', 'be', 'surmised', 'brief', 'recitation', 'facts', 'young', 'transgendered', 'girl', 'born', 'Lincoln', 'Nebraska', 'leaving', 'home', 'sets', 'out', '-an', 'insular', 'rural', 'town.The', 'real', 'tragedy', 'Brandon', 'life', 'Brandon', 'might', 'have', 'found', 'far', 'more', 'acceptance', 'anonymous', 'large', 'city', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'San', 'Francisco', 'New', 'York', 'Miami', 'even', 'Chicago', 'Instead', 'Brandon', 'exhibited', 'tendency', 'poor', 'choices', 'including', 'busts', 'check', 'fraud', 'settling', 'one-stoplight', 'town', 'younger', 'inhabitants', 'had', 'limited', 'horizons', 'brought', 'chronic', 'unemployment', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'petty', 'crime', 'meth', 'addiction', 'violent', 'boredom', 'was', 'fatal', 'mistake.Brandon', 'suffered', 'same', 'myopia', 'one', 'point', 'Brandon', 'friends', 'ambition', 'owning', 'trailer', 'park', 'Brandon', 'very', 'unorthodox', 'identity', 'Brandon', 'imaginative', 'worldview', 'was', 'dreary', 'Instead', 'seeking', 'out', 'similar', 'peers', 'Brandon', 'chose', 'friends', 'natural', 'tendency', 'was', 'have', 'narrowest', 'outlook.Truly', 'benighted', 'two', 'Brandon', 'friends', 'raped', 'beat', 'Brandon', 'when', 'discovered', 'Brandon', 'physical', 'identity', 'Brandon', 'reported', 'attack', 'two', 'men', 'were', 'brought', 'questioning', 'were', 'not', 'charged', 'local', 'Sheriff', 'referred', 'Brandon', 'death', 'several', 'times', 'release', 'killed', 'Brandon.Swank', 'plays', 'Brandon', 'sympathetically', 'not', 'acknowledging', 'serious', 'flaws', 'character', 'miserable', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'own', 'indictment.It', 'truly', 'troubling', 'anyone', 'would', 'choose', 'kill', 'person', 'Brandon', 'just', 'Brandon', 'was', 'who', 'Brandon', 'was', 'As', 'sad', 'unneccessary', 'death', 'Brandon', 'was', 'environment', 'spawned', 'event', 'even', 'more', 'sorrowful', 'especially', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'so']",N/A

518000,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CWN2,Matthew Horner,"[16, 18]","Boys Don't Cry is the movie that earned a Best Actress Oscar for Hilary Swank. Hers was a role few actresses could have played well, and she certainly deserves the praise she got, She has an interesting film career ahead of her. Call her a force to be reckoned Personally, I would have voted for Annette Bening in American Beauty. When I was a kid I, too, was mesmerized by actors playing odd, weird and/or flashy characters. Lately, I have come to the conclusion that playing a so-called normal character well and making that role unforgettable is much harder than it seems. This is a purely personal opinion and is not meant to lessen Ms. Swank's formidable talents in any way.The movie is the story of Teena Brandon [Swank], and, while some of the facts have been altered, it is a true story. Brandon was a troubled young girl from the Midwest who, in the early 1990s, decided that she should live her life as a boy. She wanted to literally change her sex. There is a tiny percentage of males who wish to become female in America, and, apparently, the number of women wanting to become men is even smaller. Teena Brandon became Brandon Teena. Outside of New York, Los Angeles or San Francisco, Brandon would have been considered an oddity, if not a threat. He, as I have come to think of Brandon, attempted to do it in an impoverished, backwoods setting, and the results were tragic.As a movie, Boys Don't Cry is the most impassioned plea for tolerance seen in a long time. It is difficult to watch it and not feel compassion for Brandon, if only because he was one of life's doomed souls. Ms. Swank portrays him as almost a ruffian, yet one who is essentially an innocent. Because the change [and the deception] works for Brandon, he honestly believes it should work for the people he meets. That is to say, since he accepts himself as a man, why can't others be fooled indefinately. He knows that people must not find out he is really a woman, but he does not think through how they might react if they do.Brandon winds up in a small town where he falls in love with Lana [Chloe Sevigney, nominated for Best Supporting Actress]. She's a nice enough girl. It's her family and her mother's friends who are dangerous. Lana can do little about her family, and Brandon turns a blind eye to potential problems.

Whether one can condone Brandon's deceptive life, one can't help but be disgusted in the tragic end she so undeservedly comes to.

The acting was great (Hilary Swank and especially Chloe Svigney) and the story was interesting, but I couldn't help but feel manipulated by the movie's director. The characters were either all good, or all bad and I didn't think anything in the movie was presented objectively.Brandon, despite having many prior arrests (and mental illness?) was never presented as anything other than good, albeit confused. When you boil the person down, what was Brandon besides a liar? Help was available for her, but she didn't want it. Despite her feelings toward everyone, all she did in the end was lie to them. Granted, she had a reason to lie, but why wasn't anyone hurt by her lies, especially Lana?And what was the deal with the accents? This was Nebraska, not Texas, but everyone was talking with a really strong southern accent.The rape scene was horribly brutal and the sex scenes were pretty hot, but for me this was just a depressing movie about some very sad and depressing people and not nearly as well written as another very sad and depressing movie about sad and depressing people: Midnight Cowboy.I also don't know what urgent social issues the movie explored. Gay hate crimes? Yeah, for maybe ten minutes out of the whole movie. Homosexuality? Not that I ever saw. Gender issues?

Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian""","[9, 12]","Boys Don't Cry seems like a hundred other exploitive teen films as the film credits roll over scenes from Nebraska small town nightlife. Its a world of young working people, not long out of high school. Happy at being freed from parental constraints they seek thrills at after-bar-parties. There is drinking, hanging out in taverns, the occasional beef leading to a fight, karaoke singing, dangerous jousts and high speed chases in cars.The familiar scenario becomes less so with the appearance of a boyish-looking girl- Teena Brandon- who looks like an extremely un-macho high school male.Hilary Swank, the actress who portrays Teena, is in almost every scene of this perfectly plotted if suspiciously predictable story.Brandon lives in Lincoln, Nebraska, but she is having a lot of difficulty there. Her attempts at bedding a member of her same sex are getting her into serious trouble. A male friend who lives in a trailer warns that her behavior will lead to violence against her after Teena is chased to his place by gay-bashers.Teena hits on a solution. She decides to try her luck with other girls in another city: Falls City, Nebraska. Right away, the young set she encounters there take a shine to her. Teena fools this new crowd into believing she is a guy. At least she fools them for awhile. Our 21 year old leading character has reversed her name to become Brandon Teena.She takes up with a group of twenty somethings and two older males who gather around the broken household of a divorced woman and her daughter Lana. Teena is smitten with Lana. And gradually, Lana gets interested in Teena.This is a love story, a long love story. The gender &quot;problem&quot; is childs play for Teena to handle at first. But gradually, the &quot;family&quot; begins to have doubts about Brandon Teena. The story is delicately told. It is a surprise to see the storys sexual details revealed so explicitly. Though the explicitness lengthens the movie, I think director Kimberley Peirce and her co-screenwriter Andy Bienen were right to risk it.The third act is extremely long. The nature of Teena's romance with Lana is dawning. There will be consequences. The mostly true story has a powerful ending. The scenario is a little too perfect, however. It is obvious the real story has been &quot;cooked&quot; slightly to strike the right moral: Homophobes are bad. I suspect Brandon's real experience in 1993 Falls City was quite a bit more complex.The central characters are extremely well rendered. The story is superb even if it is a touch too long. Hilary Swank's young man trapped in a girl's body is extraordinary. Her performance reminds me very much of the young and innocent Judy Garland of the late 30s and early 40s. The actress doesn't look that male. Her innocence is thus key to putting over this extremely complex character. Miss Swank does it smashingly. I will be very disappointed if she does not become as big a star as Garland became.",5,Gender &quot;Confusion&quot; Powers a Complex Love Story,982627200,"02 20, 2001",2001,2952,"['Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'hundred', 'other', 'exploitive', 'teen', 'films', 'film', 'credits', 'roll', 'scenes', 'Nebraska', 'small', 'town', 'nightlife', 'world', 'young', 'working', 'people', 'not', 'long', 'high', 'school', 'Happy', 'being', 'freed', 'parental', 'constraints', 'seek', 'thrills', 'after-bar-parties', 'drinking', 'hanging', 'out', 'taverns', 'occasional', 'beef', 'leading', 'fight', 'karaoke', 'singing', 'dangerous', 'jousts', 'high', 'speed', 'chases', 'cars.The', 'familiar', 'scenario', 'less', 'so', 'appearance', 'boyish-looking', 'girl-', 'Teena', 'Brandon-', 'who', 'extremely', 'un-macho', 'high', 'school', 'male.Hilary', 'Swank', 'actress', 'who', 'Teena', 'almost', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'plotted', 'suspiciously', 'predictable', 'story.Brandon', 'lives', 'Lincoln', 'Nebraska', 'having', 'lot', 'difficulty', 'there', 'attempts', 'bedding', 'member', 'same', 'sex', 'are', 'getting', 'serious', 'trouble', 'male', 'friend', 'who', 'trailer', 'behavior', 'will', 'lead', 'violence', 'Teena', 'chased', 'place', 'gay-bashers.Teena', 'hits', 'solution', 'try', 'luck', 'other', 'girls', 'city', 'Falls', 'City', 'Nebraska', 'Right', 'away', 'young', 'set', 'there', 'take', 'shine', 'Teena', 'new', 'crowd', 'believing', 'guy', 'least', 'awhile', '21', 'year', 'old', 'leading', 'character', 'reversed', 'name', 'become', 'Brandon', 'Teena.She', 'up', 'group', 'twenty', 'somethings', 'two', 'older', 'males', 'who', 'gather', 'broken', 'household', 'divorced', 'woman', 'daughter', 'Lana', 'Teena', 'smitten', 'Lana', 'gradually', 'Lana', 'interested', 'Teena.This', 'love', 'story', 'long', 'love', 'story', 'gender', 'quot', 'problem', 'quot', 'childs', 'play', 'Teena', 'handle', 'first', 'gradually', 'quot', 'family', 'quot', 'have', 'doubts', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'story', 'delicately', 'told', 'surprise', 'see', 'storys', 'sexual', 'details', 'revealed', 'so', 'explicitly', 'explicitness', 'movie', 'think', 'director', 'Kimberley', 'Peirce', 'co-screenwriter', 'Andy', 'Bienen', 'were', 'right', 'risk', 'it.The', 'third', 'act', 'extremely', 'long', 'nature', 'Teena', 'romance', 'Lana', 'dawning', 'will', 'be', 'consequences', 'mostly', 'true', 'story', 'powerful', 'ending', 'scenario', 'little', 'too', 'perfect', 'however', 'obvious', 'real', 'story', 'been', 'quot', 'cooked', 'quot', 'slightly', 'strike', 'right', 'moral', 'Homophobes', 'are', 'bad', 'suspect', 'Brandon', 'real', 'experience', '1993', 'Falls', 'City', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'complex.The', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'rendered', 'story', 'superb', 'even', 'touch', 'too', 'long', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'young', 'man', 'trapped', 'girl', 'body', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'very', 'much', 'young', 'innocent', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'late', '30s', 'early', '40s', 'actress', ""n't"", 'look', 'male', 'innocence', 'thus', 'key', 'putting', 'over', 'extremely', 'complex', 'character', 'Miss', 'Swank', 'smashingly', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'not', 'become', 'big', 'star', 'Garland', 'became']",N/A

518014,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00003CWN2,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[1, 1]","When I originally saw this movie I gave it 4 stars.  Now on rewatching I'm giving it 5.  It lost a star because though an excellent movie I did think it dragged in some sections and parts became quite tedious.  However, it is on rewatching that you can really appreciate the mastery of the movie.  The true life story of Teena Brandon, who masqueraded as a man and found a place among a family in Nebraska as well as a girlfriend, Lana (Chloe Sevigny), who upon discovering he's really a she realises she loves Teena/Brandon anyway.What makes it better second time round is the ominous sense of foreboding over the whole scenario once you have the ending in mind the whole time.  It's difficult to know where to begin with explaining why the movie is so good.  The obvious point is Hilary Swank, who gives in one of the truly great female performances of all time as Teena/Brandon.  She reportedly prepared for the role by living as a man for 4 months and all of her mannerisms, the way she holds herself and how she talks are all evident of this.  You will actually believe that a very attractive woman (just see her doe-eyed performance in Insomnia) is a young man.  Every single part of her performance here is multi-faceted, speaking anguish, pain and fear of discovery in every gesture.  Her best scenes though are those where she is interviewed by unsympathetic police officers after her rape, stumbling over the words as she is forced to reveal not only to the police officers but herself what she really is.  This is an absolutely heartbreaking moment that, for me, had more power than the horrific rape scene.  A lot of people will have a problem with this scene and it's understandable because it is horrific to watch, and you will find yourself repeating to yourself that you can't believe this really happened.  Incidentally, the questions asked at the police station at the end are reportedly the real thing, a tape of the questions asked to the real Teena Brandon.Of course, to praise Hilary Swank isn't to forget Chloe Sevigny, who is perfect in her role as a bored small-town girl who's looking for something, anything to break the boredom.  Her wide-eyed performance works wonders and she complements an all-round impressive cast.  Yet the movie also works as an emotional catharsis and besides perhaps depressing you horribly does ask some pretty important questions about identity and prejudice.  There are a few scenes that will probably stick in your head, such as the mother's firm avowal that she hates Teena/Brandon simply because he lied to her, something that goes hand-in-hand with freely admitting people she knows as rapists into her home.  In the end this is basically a story of not love gone wrong but love forced off its path by petty prejudices and narrow-minded ideals of what love should be about.  And whilst this ideas are never shoved down your throat by Pierce, you will definitely be left wondering this.  Boys Don't Cry is a magnificent piece of filmmaking that may stand as one of the truly great indie films of all time.",5,Painful to watch,1047600000,"03 14, 2003",2003,3064,"['When', 'originally', 'saw', 'movie', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'Now', 'rewatching', ""'m"", 'giving', '5', 'lost', 'star', 'excellent', 'movie', 'did', 'think', 'dragged', 'sections', 'parts', 'became', 'quite', 'tedious', 'However', 'rewatching', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'mastery', 'movie', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'who', 'masqueraded', 'man', 'found', 'place', 'family', 'Nebraska', 'as', 'well', 'girlfriend', 'Lana', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'who', 'discovering', 'really', 'Teena/Brandon', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'round', 'ominous', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'whole', 'scenario', 'once', 'have', 'ending', 'mind', 'whole', 'time', 'difficult', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'explaining', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'obvious', 'point', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'who', 'one', 'truly', 'great', 'female', 'performances', 'time', 'Teena/Brandon', 'reportedly', 'prepared', 'role', 'living', 'man', '4', 'months', 'mannerisms', 'way', 'how', 'talks', 'are', 'evident', 'will', 'actually', 'believe', 'very', 'attractive', 'woman', 'just', 'see', 'doe-eyed', 'performance', 'Insomnia', 'young', 'man', 'single', 'part', 'performance', 'here', 'multi-faceted', 'speaking', 'anguish', 'pain', 'fear', 'discovery', 'gesture', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'where', 'interviewed', 'unsympathetic', 'police', 'officers', 'rape', 'stumbling', 'words', 'forced', 'reveal', 'not', 'only', 'police', 'officers', 'what', 'really', 'absolutely', 'heartbreaking', 'moment', 'had', 'more', 'power', 'horrific', 'rape', 'scene', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'scene', 'understandable', 'horrific', 'watch', 'will', 'find', 'repeating', 'yourself', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'really', 'happened', 'Incidentally', 'questions', 'asked', 'police', 'station', 'end', 'are', 'reportedly', 'real', 'thing', 'tape', 'questions', 'asked', 'real', 'Teena', 'Brandon.Of', 'course', 'praise', 'Hilary', 'Swank', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'who', 'perfect', 'role', 'bored', 'small-town', 'girl', 'who', 'looking', 'something', 'anything', 'break', 'boredom', 'wide-eyed', 'performance', 'wonders', 'all-round', 'impressive', 'cast', 'movie', 'also', 'emotional', 'catharsis', 'perhaps', 'depressing', 'horribly', 'ask', 'pretty', 'important', 'questions', 'identity', 'prejudice', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'will', 'probably', 'stick', 'head', 'such', 'mother', 'firm', 'avowal', 'Teena/Brandon', 'simply', 'lied', 'something', 'hand-in-hand', 'freely', 'admitting', 'people', 'rapists', 'home', 'end', 'basically', 'story', 'not', 'love', 'gone', 'wrong', 'love', 'forced', 'off', 'path', 'petty', 'prejudices', 'narrow-minded', 'ideals', 'what', 'love', 'should', 'be', 'whilst', 'ideas', 'are', 'never', 'shoved', 'down', 'throat', 'Pierce', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'left', 'wondering', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'magnificent', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'may', 'stand', 'one', 'truly', 'great', 'indie', 'films', 'time']",N/A

Hillary Swank has already won the Golden Globe and every other major film critics award for Best Actress (i.e. New York, L.A.  and Chicago Film Critics, etc.) and she certainly deserves all the  recognition she's receiving.  Her performance as the doomed Brandon Teena  is riveting.  Combining a sweet akwardness and shy vunerability is what  makes Swank's performance so compelling.  She is definitely my favourite to  win on Oscar night.  And if she does win l would just like to say to all  those skeptics out there who doubted her talent, &quot;I told you so.&quot;  Equally compelling is her co-star, Chloe Sevigny, who portrays Brandon  Teena's girlfriend.

518016,A34QP8RSYBNKQF,B00003CWN2,Nasrollah Sekandari,"[16, 17]","Love is one of the components that drive us in our daily lives, without it life wouldn't be the same.  In ""Boys Don't Cry,"" that is all Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank) wants.  His search to be accepted and love gets him into a  lot of trouble because he is a she.  To Teena that never seems to be an  issue, she knows that deep down inside she is a guy longing for that right  girl.  Her search gets her in trouble and forces her to leave to another  town.  She meets the perfect girl Lana (Chole Sevigny) and her group of  friends.  She feels accepted and just one of the guys.  She gets into bar  room brawls and drinks and smokes with the guys.  Her relationship with  Lana blossoms and everything seems to be going great, until her little  secret is revealed.  She pays the price of her deception with her life.  ""Boys Don't Cry"" is based on the true events of Teena Brandon's life in  rural Nebraska.  Directed by newcomer Kimberly Peirce, it is one of the  best movies of last year.  Hilary Swank gives the performance of a lifetime  as Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena.  Swank won the Oscar for her performance in  this film.  Swank has a certain charm and charisma that enables the viewer  to love her character and not judge her actions.  It doesn't seem out of  the ordinary or weird that she wants to be a guy.  She is a guy, her  mannerisms and looks gives the viewer the sense that she was meant to be a  guy.  That somehow god made a mistake and that Teena is just correcting  it.  The viewer gets pulled into her charm.  You want her to get the girl  and be happy.  You feel her desire for love and want and cheer for her to  get it.  Swank's performance gets the viewers to fall for Teena and see who  he really is on the inside and not what he is on the outside.  The  supporting cast is also another strong point of this film.  Sevigny gives a  strong performance as Lana, a troubled buy loving girl who falls for Teena.  Sevigny got an Oscar nomination for her performance in this film.  Lana  loves Teena for what he is, a charming, caring and sensitive person.  Even  when she is confronted with the truth, she looks away.  His word is all she  needs and even after the truth comes out she still loves him.  She still  goes to him and realizes that her love for him is more important than his  gender.  She sees the love in him and loves it back with no reservations in  her mind. Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III also give strong  performances as John and Tom.  They befriend Teena after a bar fight and  introduce him to Lana.  They are a rough group with a criminal past, but at  first they seem like good people.  But they have a wild temper and when  they find out the truth, the consequences become deadly.  The film has a  slow pace, but with good cause.  It stays close to the actual events of the  story and treats the story delicately.  The acting and writing keeps the  story going and makes the viewer drawn to the characters and the events  that unfold",5,A slow paced jem of a movie!,955843200,"04 16, 2000",2000,2984,"['Love', 'one', 'components', 'drive', 'daily', 'lives', 'life', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'search', 'be', 'accepted', 'love', 'lot', 'trouble', 'Teena', 'never', 'be', 'issue', 'deep', 'down', 'guy', 'longing', 'right', 'girl', 'search', 'trouble', 'leave', 'town', 'perfect', 'girl', 'Lana', 'Chole', 'Sevigny', 'group', 'friends', 'accepted', 'just', 'one', 'guys', 'bar', 'room', 'brawls', 'drinks', 'smokes', 'guys', 'relationship', 'Lana', 'blossoms', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'great', 'little', 'secret', 'revealed', 'price', 'deception', 'life', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'life', 'rural', 'Nebraska', 'Directed', 'newcomer', 'Kimberly', 'Peirce', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'last', 'year', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Teena', 'Brandon/Brandon', 'Teena', 'Swank', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'film', 'Swank', 'certain', 'charm', 'charisma', 'viewer', 'love', 'character', 'not', 'judge', 'actions', ""n't"", 'seem', 'out', 'ordinary', 'weird', 'be', 'guy', 'guy', 'mannerisms', 'viewer', 'sense', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'guy', 'somehow', 'god', 'made', 'mistake', 'Teena', 'just', 'correcting', 'viewer', 'pulled', 'charm', 'want', 'get', 'girl', 'be', 'happy', 'feel', 'desire', 'love', 'want', 'cheer', 'get', 'Swank', 'performance', 'viewers', 'fall', 'Teena', 'see', 'who', 'really', 'inside', 'not', 'what', 'outside', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'strong', 'point', 'film', 'Sevigny', 'strong', 'performance', 'Lana', 'troubled', 'buy', 'loving', 'girl', 'who', 'Teena', 'Sevigny', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'film', 'Lana', 'Teena', 'what', 'charming', 'caring', 'sensitive', 'person', 'Even', 'when', 'confronted', 'truth', 'away', 'word', 'even', 'truth', 'out', 'still', 'still', 'love', 'more', 'important', 'gender', 'love', 'back', 'reservations', 'mind', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Brendan', 'Sexton', 'III', 'also', 'give', 'strong', 'performances', 'John', 'Tom', 'befriend', 'Teena', 'bar', 'fight', 'introduce', 'Lana', 'are', 'rough', 'group', 'criminal', 'past', 'first', 'seem', 'good', 'people', 'have', 'wild', 'temper', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'consequences', 'become', 'deadly', 'film', 'slow', 'pace', 'good', 'cause', 'close', 'actual', 'events', 'story', 'story', 'delicately', 'acting', 'writing', 'keeps', 'story', 'going', 'viewer', 'drawn', 'characters', 'events', 'unfold']",N/A

Only the audience knew the doom; to Brandon and Lana,  it was the beginning.The killings were unjustifiable, but I really felt  compassion for the two killers. They weren't anonymous or cold, they were  human beings like Brandon, struggling to find their own identities. Peirce  painted a vivid picture of their dead-end lives, forgotten just for a  moment through alcohol and drugs. The time-lapsed cinematography of the  smoke billowing from the factories, the clouds flying through the sky, the  characters seemed suspended helplessly in their personal hell.Even as  Brandon is savagely raped, we're not asked to feel pity for Brandon, nor  anger at the rapists who were once his friends.

518038,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CWN2,Roland E. Zwick,"[10, 10]","The most impressive aspect of `Boys Don't Cry' is that it refuses to shy away from the sordid details of much of its protagonist's life, yet manages to convert her (or him if you prefer) into a sympathetic and comprehensible  figure. In our most honest moments, we can all acknowledge aspects of our  own lives and personalities that we don't understand, that we would love to  change and that often make us feel alienated from the `norm' of society at  large. In the case of Teena Brandon - a young man `trapped' in a woman's  body - the anomaly happens to be a more pronounced and certainly less  socially acceptable one than most of us are forced to endure in our lives.  And she paid the ultimate price society demands from those it fears and  does not understand: she was murdered in Nebraska in 1993, simply for being  `different.'The film builds a convincing case for compassionate  understanding without converting Brandon into a saint-like figure. Not only  do we witness the petty criminality of her life, but we see her propensity  for duplicity and deception, a personality trait that actually leads in  part to many of the troubles she encounters, playing a crucial role to a  large extent even in her death itself. Yet, given society's out-of-hand  rejection of transgendered people, what real options but a life of  dishonesty is Brandon really given? Similarly, Lana, the young woman with  whom Brandon falls in love and the one person who has ever accepted Brandon  unconditionally for what she is, suffers from a number of her own  demons.Credit writer/director Kimberly Pierce and co-writer Andy Bienen  for not taking the easy commercial path of reducing the moral complexities  of the personalities involved to a black-and-white world where good and  evil are displayed in neatly arranged patterns for our easy consumption.  There are many times in this film when literally none of the people we are  involved with are the slightest bit appealing. The filmmakers, in their  faith in our maturity, ask us to go along on a pretty harrowing journey at  times, but it is one that leads us to a very rewarding destination. The  scenes in which Brandon's companions expose her secret is riveting and  terrifying in its dramatic intensity and human sadness. The utter  humiliation Brandon is forced to endure at the hands of the hooligans who  are tormenting her broadens to become a symbolic representation of every  person who has suffered such an injustice at the hands of unreasoning  ignorance for whatever reason. It is a chilling reminder of the danger of  the mob mentality unrestrained by empathy and enlightenment.Like so many  of the best off-Hollywood independent productions, `Boys Don't Cry' finds  its truth in two crucial elements: the canny depiction of the bleak  sterility and stifling provincialism of its Midwest setting and the  uniformly first-rate performances by a largely unknown set of  actors.Hilary Swank, in her Oscar-winning turn as Brandon, and Chloe  Sevigny as Lana achieve a naturalism in their portrayals that neutralizes  any theatricality that might have robbed the film of its indispensable  quality of immediacy and believability. They convert what might, in less  capable hands, have become little more than a sensationalized freak show  into a powerful and understandable drama about real, thoroughly  recognizable human beings.

This film is very powerful, as it invokes various amounts of intense emotion and thought within the viewer, and the fact that this is based on a true story is what makes the film the more powerful.A quick synopsis on the film:Teena Brandon (who dresses like a boy, and goes by the alias of Brandon Teena) gets into a barfight over a girl named Candace (played by Alicia Goranson, as seen on television sitcom Roseanne), and in the midst of this, meets her friends John (played by Peter Sarsgaard) and Tom (played by Brendan Sexton III), two ex-cons. Teena becomes buddies with these two, and they invite her to a party in their hometown. The next day, they go to a different bar, and she then meets the moody and enigmatic Lana (played by Chlo Sevigny), along with her mother (played by Jeanetta Arnette) and one of Lana's friends, Kate (played by Allison Folland.)Things seem quite bright and rosy, as Teena seems to be accepted as if she were one of the family. She seems to become one of the boys along with Tom and John, drinking and getting into trouble like any typical young misfit would. She develops an ever-blossoming love relationship with Lana, which helps to showcase some of the most beautiful, heartwarming and poignant attributes of the film. Everything seems quite lovely.Later, things start to take a turn for the worse, as Teena's skeletons start to catch up with her, and the guise she depended on slowly starts to crumble. The beautiful lie gets shattered, and everything that was once peaceful becomes corrupted, and ultimately, she payed the price in one of the worst ways possible. As things start to crumble for Teena, the viewer's emotions start to spiral downhill from what was once an ethereal, transcendent disposition in quite an intense, earth-shattering way as well. You start to feel bad for Teena, and start to sympathize with her, even though she's made quite a few mistakes (e.g. breaking the law, lying about her real gender.) That's one of the many things that made this film so profound.Hilary Swank gave a powerful and convincing performance, and I think she deserved the award she won indefinitely. Chlo Sevigny also gave an excellent performance as the moody, enigmatic and sympathetic Lana, who seemed to have quite a bit underneath her surface. She should have won an award as well. I can't stress these actresses enough (along with the director and film in general.)An excellent, powerful film, this is one of my all-time favorite movies. This review won't do it any justice. It's beautiful, sad, ethereal, poignant, atmospheric and disturbing all at once. I highly recommend it to people who think they can handle this story. Also, check out the documentary called ""The Brandon Teena Story"" if you've watched this movie, and wanted more information regarding the story, since this movie was based on that documentary. However, the documentary is more disturbing than the film.",5,"Heart-wrenching, powerful, intelligent",1056326400,"06 23, 2003",2003,3053,"['Hilary', 'Swank', 'won', 'award', 'powerful', 'portrayal', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'sexual', 'identity-confused', 'woman', 'run', 'law', 'film', 'very', 'powerful', 'various', 'amounts', 'intense', 'emotion', 'thought', 'viewer', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'what', 'film', 'more', 'powerful.A', 'quick', 'synopsis', 'film', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'who', 'boy', 'alias', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'barfight', 'girl', 'named', 'Candace', 'played', 'Alicia', 'Goranson', 'seen', 'television', 'sitcom', 'Roseanne', 'midst', 'friends', 'John', 'played', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Tom', 'played', 'Brendan', 'Sexton', 'III', 'two', 'ex-cons', 'Teena', 'buddies', 'two', 'invite', 'party', 'hometown', 'next', 'day', 'go', 'different', 'bar', 'then', 'moody', 'enigmatic', 'Lana', 'played', 'Chlo', 'Sevigny', 'mother', 'played', 'Jeanetta', 'Arnette', 'one', 'Lana', 'friends', 'Kate', 'played', 'Allison', 'Folland', 'Things', 'seem', 'quite', 'bright', 'rosy', 'Teena', 'be', 'accepted', 'were', 'one', 'family', 'become', 'one', 'boys', 'Tom', 'John', 'drinking', 'getting', 'trouble', 'typical', 'young', 'misfit', 'would', 'ever-blossoming', 'love', 'relationship', 'Lana', 'showcase', 'most', 'beautiful', 'heartwarming', 'poignant', 'attributes', 'film', 'Everything', 'quite', 'lovely.Later', 'things', 'start', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'Teena', 'skeletons', 'start', 'catch', 'up', 'guise', 'depended', 'slowly', 'starts', 'crumble', 'beautiful', 'lie', 'shattered', 'everything', 'was', 'once', 'peaceful', 'becomes', 'corrupted', 'ultimately', 'payed', 'price', 'one', 'worst', 'ways', 'possible', 'things', 'start', 'crumble', 'Teena', 'viewer', 'emotions', 'start', 'spiral', 'downhill', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'ethereal', 'transcendent', 'disposition', 'quite', 'intense', 'earth-shattering', 'way', 'well', 'start', 'feel', 'bad', 'Teena', 'start', 'sympathize', 'even', 'made', 'quite', 'few', 'mistakes', 'e.g', 'breaking', 'law', 'lying', 'real', 'gender', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'profound.Hilary', 'Swank', 'gave', 'powerful', 'convincing', 'performance', 'think', 'deserved', 'award', 'won', 'indefinitely', 'Chlo', 'Sevigny', 'also', 'gave', 'excellent', 'performance', 'moody', 'enigmatic', 'sympathetic', 'Lana', 'who', 'seemed', 'have', 'quite', 'bit', 'surface', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'award', 'as', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'actresses', 'enough', 'director', 'film', 'general', 'excellent', 'powerful', 'film', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'beautiful', 'sad', 'ethereal', 'poignant', 'atmospheric', 'disturbing', 'once', 'highly', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'can', 'handle', 'story', 'Also', 'check', 'out', 'documentary', 'called', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'Story', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'wanted', 'more', 'information', 'regarding', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'documentary', 'However', 'documentary', 'more', 'disturbing', 'film']",N/A

Right off hand, I can't think of any other independent movie that has matched this one in the areas of acting and direction.But I found it very hard to be moved by the film for the single reason that the characterizations were too extreme. The &quot;white trash&quot; boys were too evil, and far too much effort was spent trying to get the audience riled up against their narrow-mindedness. And Brandon Teena was way too angelic and innocent; this was completely at odds with his criminal past and his facility at lying.So by the time the dramatic climax came, I felt like I was watching propoganda. This sort of overboard rendition of the story does a disservice to the real lessons of the ordeal that Brandon endured.[I might have rounded this rating up to four stars, but I ended up rounding it down because of the Featurette on the DVD version - it was downright offensive. In it, the filmmakers get on-screen and gush about how this was a story about &quot;individualism&quot; and &quot;living your own life no matter what other people think.&quot;In their desire to elevate Brandon to hero status, the filmmakers equate &quot;being out-of-control&quot; with &quot;being free&quot;, a bad message to be sending. With respect to Brandon, this story has a lot more to do with how his confusion over his sexual identity led to confusion in the rest of life, and how this confusion led to bad decisions and self-destruction.]",3,"Hit the audience over the head, why don't ya?",997660800,"08 13, 2001",2001,1491,"['will', 'join', 'giving', 'movie', 'production', 'values', 'Right', 'hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'independent', 'movie', 'matched', 'one', 'areas', 'acting', 'direction.But', 'found', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'moved', 'film', 'single', 'reason', 'characterizations', 'were', 'too', 'extreme', 'quot', 'white', 'trash', 'quot', 'boys', 'were', 'too', 'evil', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'was', 'spent', 'trying', 'get', 'audience', 'riled', 'up', 'narrow-mindedness', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'angelic', 'innocent', 'was', 'completely', 'odds', 'criminal', 'past', 'facility', 'lying.So', 'time', 'dramatic', 'climax', 'came', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'propoganda', 'sort', 'overboard', 'rendition', 'story', 'disservice', 'real', 'lessons', 'ordeal', 'Brandon', 'endured', '[', 'might', 'have', 'rounded', 'rating', 'up', 'four', 'stars', 'ended', 'up', 'rounding', 'down', 'Featurette', 'DVD', 'version', 'was', 'downright', 'offensive', 'filmmakers', 'get', 'on-screen', 'gush', 'how', 'was', 'story', 'quot', 'individualism', 'quot', 'quot', 'living', 'own', 'life', 'matter', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'think.', 'quot', 'desire', 'elevate', 'Brandon', 'hero', 'status', 'filmmakers', 'equate', 'quot', 'being', 'out-of-control', 'quot', 'quot', 'being', 'free', 'quot', 'bad', 'message', 'be', 'sending', 'respect', 'Brandon', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'do', 'how', 'confusion', 'sexual', 'identity', 'led', 'confusion', 'rest', 'life', 'how', 'confusion', 'led', 'bad', 'decisions', 'self-destruction', ']']",N/A

Second, the story also doesn't explain about the two men's affilliation with a white supremacist organization.  They may have been targeting both Teena or DeVine or both.  The movie purpose seems like it has an ajenda towards the advancement of gay rights.  If that's the case, it should have been explained in the credits at the beginning or end of the film.

The acting was so good that I honestly detested every single guy that appeared in this movie for being the horrible ba****ds that they were, even though (I know, I know) they are just actors and the real ones are out there and I don't even know how they look. But still... ironically if I'd met my husband back then I'd probably not even give him a second look.This is one of those movies you either want to watch or can't be bothered to. If you're a guy who really can't be interested in spending some of your time watching a film about 1)a really butch Hilary Swank and 2)a tearjerking movie, then save yourself the trouble. This is a chick-flick in many respects - its theme is about lesbianism, and the fact that this was based on a real life story of Brandon Teena in a stuffy-minded town in Nebraska made it all the more depressing. I walked away hoping in my heart that she's happy now wherever she is. But then this didn't have to happen to her. So all the more it affirms the fact that life's not fair.This movie is also studded with surrealistic blurry images which actually made the budding love story between Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny even more compelling... The soundtrack was excellent and suited this movie's scenes so well. Watch it if you like a semi-romantic and tragic drama... you'll never forget this.

I think that what most of you felt was the prime tool used in the attempt to make an impact with its audience: shock  value. I have to admit, I cringed a little bit when I was watching the  lesbian sex scenes, but I had to remind myself that relationships like that  are going on EVERYWHERE. Then there's the strange behavior of each  character with the exception of Chloe Sevigny and Hilary Swank. Everyone  drinks all day and gets high every night in a dark and foreboding wasteland  called Falls City, Nebraska, bumper skiing and generally acting like a  bunch of idiots. Trailer trash, to put it simply. Everyone is warped in  their own weird way, whether it be from something behavioral or something  sexual. I also had to remind myself that there's trailer trash like that  EVERYWHERE too. Most people know this, know that they can go into a bad  part of town and see it instead of turning on their televisions and have to  watch it, but I think that's what this movie needed. All throughout,  there's a strong sense of discomfort for every subject. That's life.  There's always going to be something that people don't like to talk about,  that they won't admit or they're trying to avoid, that they're biased  against or have a deep hatred for. Homosexuality, dysfunctional families,  drugs, alcoholism and indecent behavior are all the integral parts for a  depraved story such as this one, and the raw manner in which it was  directed was the foundation for the shock value and the disturbing but all  too real truth, sad as it may be. Things as crazy and depressing as this  happen everyday. This movie is a sad reminder of murders such as the  inhumane ending of the life of Matthew Sheppard, a gay high school student  who was harrassed and finally killed by fellow classmates. There's not a  glint of hope throughout the film, but the performances are what make this  movie watchable. Hilary Swank is unbelievably convincing, her mannerisms  and boyish charisma endearing and impressive. Chloe Sevigny is her  right-hand, a powerful and emotional addition to the ill-fated romance that  they share, and the blind love that tenaciously survives even after Brandon  Teena's true identity is painfully revealed. I have to admit, the shock  value worked on me, especially during the final half hour of the movie when  all the prejudice and hate in the world unite to reveal the hideous face of  evil, once again taking more human lives. Even though there are several  warning labels posted in these customer reviews, please give this film a  fighting chance.

Teena Brandon's life was a lot more than the couple of weeks before she was brutally raped and murdered by two ""friends.""Also, a third person (named Philip Devine) was murdered in the house.  They did not give Teena's murdered friend (played by Roseanne's Lecy Goransen) much attention, and didn't even use her real name.  It was like they wanted to sensationalize the fact that Teena Brandon was a lesbian and completely forgot about the two straight people who died.Another problem I have with this movie is how it drags.  They try too hard to make them sound uneducated, and some of the accents are too far-fetched.Finally, Lana Tisdel is not reported to have been at the murder scene.  It is just too ridiculous to believe that she was there and lived.  John Lotter and Thomas Nissen almost killed a baby!A lot of this film is about sexual obsession.  It's clear John Lotter was murderous because he was obsessed with Lana, and that was probably true in real life.  The rape was horribly violent, and caused me a lot of distress to see.The sheriff's treatment of the young, frightened victim was also horrifying - because the unspoken message was ""You're a dyke, you needed it, get over it and shut up.""Overall, I wouldn't say don't see it, but don't believe it's the whole story or the truest story.

It's a devastating story about a woman with a sexual identity crisis, named Teena Brandon who dressed up like a guy, took hormone shots, and called herself Brandon Teena. She befriended two rednecks from a small town in Nebraska, and found herself a girlfriend named Lana. Once her true identity is discovered, the film takes you on an emotional roller coaster.The performances here are perfect, especially those of Hillary Swank (who won her first Oscar for her performance in this film)and Chloe Sevingy (who was nominated for an Oscar). First time director, Kimberly Pierce, has made a film that will not be forgotten. My only complaint was the graphic sexual scenes. If they make you uncomfortable, then foward through them. That's what I did. Many may not be able to stomach this film because of the no-holds barred grittiness of it. It's heartbreaking, and I could not get it off of my mind.

The film is based on a multiple murder that occurred in a run down Nebraska farmhouse in 1993.  What appeared at the time to be an inexplicably brutal killing soon turned into something far more intriguing as the true story of the killers and one of the victims emerged.  Among the dead was a person who had been in town only a short while but had already become one of the town's most fascinating characters:  a rebel, a loyal friend, and an irresistible romancer of the ladies.That person was Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), not the boy he and everyone else wanted him to be.  Knowing him as a dashing boyfriend to many women, people were shocked to learn after his death that Brandon Teena was, in fact, a woman from Lincoln, Nebraska, named Teena Brandon.  While Teena was a young adult trapped in a world that did not accept her, Brandon Teena was a fun-loving fellow with beautiful girlfriends who publicly adored him.""Boys Don't Cry"" is one of those bizarre true stories that cannot help but fascinate and intrigue.  For the film to succeed, the role of Teena as Brandon must be convincing.  If everyone who knew Brandon believed that she was a he, the audience has to be convinced as well, despite the explicit information given at the very beginning of the film.  Swank accomplishes this through her angular face, close-cropped hair, physical mannerisms, and lilting midwestern drawl. Though the viewer watches carefully to catch a moment in which her femininity comes through, it never does.It is virtually impossible not to be drawn to the film because of Swank's performance, which is captivating. The film is violent, often painfully so, as co-writer/director Kimberly Peirce recounts the odd events surrounding Brandon's ability to endear himself to people -- particularly female -- and to make friends easily.  In the few scenes in which Brandon's true sex is revealed, Swank transforms into an awkward, embarrassed, tense outcast, knowing full well she is perceived as a freak.  Gone is Brandon's winning smile, gone is Brandon's confidence, and gone is the very persona Teena has adopted.""Boys Don't Cry"" is one of those films that simply must be seen.  It is unique among standard Hollywood fare.  Not for the squeamish, it is a look at a dark, unpleasant side of how differences in individuals are not tolerated, society often accepts the expedient lie rather than the difficult truth, and stupidity and bigotry can lead to tragedy.Swank elicits viewer compassion on several levels.  Clearly, she is emotionally troubled, yet has adjusted her persona to fit in and feel comfortable.  Her Brandon can flirt with attractive girls, become friends with them, and even carry the relationship to a sexual level.  In the latter part of the film, she is the object of violence simply because she has successfully fooled those around her -- primarily low-life types whose own sexuality is threatened and whose alcohol-clouded minds inspire them to a ""payback"" of humiliating brutality.The script, by Peirce and Andy Bienen, moves along briskly, seldom meandering.  There is no sense of padding, as each scene provides a new dimension to the story.  We learn that Brandon has a police record for petty crimes, but little else about Teena's/Brandon""s past is revealed. This gives the film a suitable mystery.  The viewer shares an off-balance feeling with the characters in the film.  The writers based their screenplay on an assortment of trial transcripts, media coverage, interviews with local kids, real-life participants, and their own imagination. The result is an intense look at events in the life of a misfit being the ""perfect boyfriend"" to lonely, innocent, and underprivileged young women.Rated R, ""Boys Don't Cry"" succeeds primarily because of Swank's unique, often startling performance. It transcends the ordinary and sweeps the viewer up into Brandon Teena's peculiar,tragic life.",5,Tour de Force Performance by Hilary Swank,1052265600,"05 7, 2003",2003,4054,"['Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'been', 'cited', 'two', 'major', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Best', 'Actress', 'film', 'based', 'multiple', 'murder', 'occurred', 'run', 'down', 'Nebraska', 'farmhouse', '1993', 'What', 'appeared', 'time', 'be', 'inexplicably', 'brutal', 'killing', 'soon', 'turned', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'intriguing', 'true', 'story', 'killers', 'one', 'victims', 'emerged', 'dead', 'was', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'town', 'only', 'short', 'while', 'had', 'already', 'become', 'one', 'town', 'most', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'rebel', 'loyal', 'friend', 'irresistible', 'romancer', 'ladies.That', 'person', 'was', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'not', 'boy', 'everyone', 'else', 'wanted', 'be', 'Knowing', 'dashing', 'boyfriend', 'many', 'women', 'people', 'were', 'shocked', 'learn', 'death', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'was', 'fact', 'woman', 'Lincoln', 'Nebraska', 'named', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'was', 'young', 'adult', 'trapped', 'world', 'did', 'not', 'accept', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'was', 'fun-loving', 'fellow', 'beautiful', 'girlfriends', 'who', 'publicly', 'adored', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'one', 'bizarre', 'true', 'stories', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'fascinate', 'intrigue', 'film', 'succeed', 'role', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'must', 'be', 'convincing', 'everyone', 'who', 'knew', 'Brandon', 'believed', 'was', 'audience', 'be', 'convinced', 'well', 'explicit', 'information', 'given', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'Swank', 'angular', 'face', 'close-cropped', 'hair', 'physical', 'mannerisms', 'lilting', 'midwestern', 'drawl', 'viewer', 'watches', 'carefully', 'catch', 'moment', 'femininity', 'never', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'drawn', 'film', 'Swank', 'performance', 'captivating', 'film', 'violent', 'often', 'painfully', 'so', 'co-writer/director', 'Kimberly', 'Peirce', 'odd', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Brandon', 'ability', 'endear', 'people', 'particularly', 'female', 'make', 'friends', 'easily', 'few', 'scenes', 'Brandon', 'true', 'sex', 'revealed', 'Swank', 'awkward', 'embarrassed', 'tense', 'outcast', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'perceived', 'freak', 'Gone', 'Brandon', 'winning', 'smile', 'gone', 'Brandon', 'confidence', 'gone', 'very', 'persona', 'Teena', 'adopted', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'one', 'films', 'simply', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'unique', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'Not', 'squeamish', 'look', 'dark', 'unpleasant', 'side', 'how', 'differences', 'individuals', 'are', 'not', 'tolerated', 'society', 'often', 'expedient', 'lie', 'rather', 'difficult', 'truth', 'stupidity', 'bigotry', 'can', 'lead', 'tragedy.Swank', 'elicits', 'viewer', 'compassion', 'several', 'levels', 'Clearly', 'emotionally', 'troubled', 'yet', 'adjusted', 'persona', 'fit', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'Brandon', 'can', 'flirt', 'attractive', 'girls', 'become', 'friends', 'even', 'carry', 'relationship', 'sexual', 'level', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'object', 'violence', 'simply', 'successfully', 'fooled', 'primarily', 'low-life', 'types', 'own', 'sexuality', 'threatened', 'alcohol-clouded', 'minds', 'inspire', 'payback', 'humiliating', 'brutality.The', 'script', 'Peirce', 'Andy', 'Bienen', 'along', 'briskly', 'seldom', 'meandering', 'sense', 'padding', 'scene', 'new', 'dimension', 'story', 'learn', 'Brandon', 'police', 'record', 'petty', 'crimes', 'little', 'else', ""Teena's/Brandon"", 's', 'past', 'revealed', 'film', 'suitable', 'mystery', 'viewer', 'shares', 'off-balance', 'feeling', 'characters', 'film', 'writers', 'based', 'screenplay', 'assortment', 'trial', 'transcripts', 'media', 'coverage', 'interviews', 'local', 'kids', 'real-life', 'participants', 'own', 'imagination', 'result', 'intense', 'look', 'events', 'life', 'misfit', 'being', 'perfect', 'boyfriend', 'lonely', 'innocent', 'underprivileged', 'young', 'women.Rated', 'R', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'primarily', 'Swank', 'unique', 'often', 'startling', 'performance', 'ordinary', 'viewer', 'up', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'peculiar', 'tragic', 'life']",N/A

Nebraska never looked so  alternative.Oscar winner Hillary Swank and nominee Chloe Sevigny both  give standout performances, humanizing their characters making us believe  we are watching a real life situation unfolding.  The girl from the tv show  &quot;Roseanne&quot; also gives a great performance, along with the actress  who played the mother.  The 2 guys in the film who played the white trash  thugs give me the creeps.  That's how good this movie is, it honestly makes  you love and hate the characters with passionate intensity.As for the  reviewer who only saw the film as &quot;teena brandon hanging out in bars  looking for lesbian sex&quot;, well you obviously missed the point of the  movie.  It's not a trivial &quot;feel-good date movie&quot;.  It has a  deeper, more important theme.  Boys Dont Cry is a story about a lost soul  searching for his/her identity.  While her search is battling against a  world with little campassion or understanding of her needs and feelings as  a human being.  The strident voice of middle American intolerance is  Brandon's ill fated downfall in life.  He only wanted love, because  everybody needs love.",5,the bluest eyes in texas are holding him tonight,956102400,"04 19, 2000",2000,1492,"['Not', 'only', 'were', 'performances', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'fantastic', 'so', 'was', 'directing', 'Kimberely', 'Pierce', 'directed', 'film', 'modern', 'light', 'giving', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'almost', 'quot', 'underground', 'quot', 'aestectic', 'quality', 'used', 'dark', 'midwestern', 'landscapes', 'splashed', 'strikingly', 'bright', 'colours', 'city', 'neon', 'lights', 'Nebraska', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'alternative.Oscar', 'winner', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'nominee', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'give', 'standout', 'performances', 'humanizing', 'characters', 'making', 'believe', 'are', 'watching', 'real', 'life', 'situation', 'unfolding', 'girl', 'tv', 'show', 'quot', 'Roseanne', 'quot', 'also', 'great', 'performance', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'mother', '2', 'guys', 'film', 'who', 'played', 'white', 'trash', 'thugs', 'give', 'creeps', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'honestly', 'love', 'hate', 'characters', 'passionate', 'intensity.As', 'reviewer', 'who', 'only', 'saw', 'film', 'quot', 'brandon', 'hanging', 'out', 'bars', 'looking', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'quot', 'well', 'obviously', 'missed', 'point', 'movie', 'not', 'trivial', 'quot', 'feel-good', 'date', 'movie', 'quot', 'deeper', 'more', 'important', 'theme', 'Boys', 'Dont', 'Cry', 'story', 'lost', 'soul', 'searching', 'his/her', 'identity', 'search', 'battling', 'world', 'little', 'campassion', 'understanding', 'needs', 'feelings', 'human', 'being', 'strident', 'voice', 'middle', 'American', 'intolerance', 'Brandon', 'ill', 'fated', 'downfall', 'life', 'only', 'wanted', 'love', 'everybody', 'love']",N/A

It's that simple. She said as much on &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; and in different publications. It is this kind of forth-right and brave honesty that has allowed her to make such an amazingly powerful film.Most of us already know about the awards and accolades. Hilary Swank acted her way to an Academy Award, Chloe Sevigny to a nomination. It made just about everyone's top 10 list. It got the Big Thumbs Up from Roger Ebert. It won Golden Globes and IFP/West Independent Spirit awards. The list goes on, multiple Film Fest inclusions, etc.People - there is a reason for all the hoop-la.This is, quiet honestly, the most powerful film to hit the American landscape since &quot;Deer Hunter&quot;.It is brutal in it's honesty and highly emotional in it's story-telling.Hilary Swank ( previously known for a stint on &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot; and a starring role in &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; ) deserves every award she's been given. She turns in a standing-ovation of a performance. Nuanced and gentle, swaggering and tough, you will believe that people accepted Brandon as a man, there's no doubt. Hilary Swank became Brandon Teena, they are inseparable.Chloe Sevigny ( from &quot;Kids&quot; and more recently &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot; and &quot;American Psycho&quot; ) also turns in an amazing performance as Brandon's girlfriend.There is raw emotion and electricity traveling between these young actresses and it lights up the screen.The vision, though, belongs to Kimberly Pierce. She's done an outstanding job directing this film - allowing it to be both brutal ( the rape scene ) and beautiful ( Lana and Brandon making love ).I walked away feeling drained, and I will admit it, a little depressed. I couldn't talk about the film for days, it moved me so personally.You may end up shaking your head, unbelieving, but this is a true story, based on real people. That makes it all the more touching.This film is highly recommended. It's one of the best Independent ( or mainstream for that matter ) Films ever made.You will be moved, that is certain.Best",5,Outstanding Performances - Wonderful Direction - Must See !,990489600,"05 22, 2001",2001,2262,"['Warning', 'review', 'critical', 'plot', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'seen', 'Kimberly', 'Pierce', 'fell', 'love', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'simple', 'said', 'as', 'much', 'quot', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'quot', 'different', 'publications', 'kind', 'forth-right', 'brave', 'honesty', 'allowed', 'make', 'such', 'amazingly', 'powerful', 'film.Most', 'already', 'know', 'awards', 'accolades', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'acted', 'way', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'nomination', 'made', 'just', 'everyone', 'top', '10', 'list', 'got', 'Big', 'Thumbs', 'Up', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'IFP/West', 'Independent', 'Spirit', 'awards', 'list', 'multiple', 'Film', 'Fest', 'inclusions', 'etc.People', 'reason', 'hoop-la.This', 'quiet', 'honestly', 'most', 'powerful', 'film', 'hit', 'American', 'landscape', 'quot', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'quot', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'highly', 'emotional', 'story-telling.Hilary', 'Swank', 'previously', 'known', 'stint', 'quot', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'quot', 'starring', 'role', 'quot', 'Next', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'quot', 'award', 'been', 'given', 'standing-ovation', 'performance', 'Nuanced', 'gentle', 'swaggering', 'tough', 'will', 'believe', 'people', 'accepted', 'Brandon', 'man', 'doubt', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'became', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'are', 'inseparable.Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'quot', 'Kids', 'quot', 'more', 'recently', 'quot', 'Walls', 'Could', 'Talk', '2', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'also', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Brandon', 'girlfriend.There', 'raw', 'emotion', 'electricity', 'traveling', 'young', 'actresses', 'up', 'screen.The', 'vision', 'Kimberly', 'Pierce', 'done', 'outstanding', 'job', 'directing', 'film', 'allowing', 'be', 'brutal', 'rape', 'scene', 'beautiful', 'Lana', 'Brandon', 'making', 'love', '.I', 'walked', 'away', 'feeling', 'drained', 'will', 'admit', 'little', 'depressed', 'could', ""n't"", 'talk', 'film', 'days', 'moved', 'personally.You', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'shaking', 'head', 'unbelieving', 'true', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'people', 'more', 'touching.This', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended', 'one', 'best', 'Independent', 'mainstream', 'matter', 'Films', 'ever', 'made.You', 'will', 'be', 'moved', 'certain.Best']",N/A
