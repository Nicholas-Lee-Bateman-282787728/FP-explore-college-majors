I think this one is my most favorite. As an added benefit it gets my heart rate up as if I was doing cardio. I feel just great afterwards. It breaks weight lifting plateaus caused by old style lifting of only heavy weights with too much resting in-between. I'm also very impressed with Gaylene, one of the background exercisers, the 57 year old with the most awesome body.",5,Motivating and Effective,1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,508,"['love', 'Jari', 'greatly', 'own', 'workouts', 'are', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'one', 'different', 'challenges', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'added', 'benefit', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'was', 'doing', 'cardio', 'feel', 'just', 'great', 'afterwards', 'weight', 'lifting', 'plateaus', 'caused', 'old', 'style', 'lifting', 'only', 'heavy', 'weights', 'too', 'much', 'resting', 'in-between', ""'m"", 'also', 'very', 'impressed', 'Gaylene', 'one', 'background', 'exercisers', '57', 'year', 'old', 'most', 'awesome', 'body']",Get Ripped! with Jari Love: Get Ripped & Chiseled
1006901,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000GTJSVC,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[174, 176]","I'm fairly new to Jari's workouts but have really been enjoying them--I love how she pushes you to work hard yet doesn't kill you.  I was thrilled to be able to preview her newest video, Ripped & Chiseled.  I found it to be most similar to her Get Ripped Slim & Lean in that it is a long workout (just over an hour) which really challenges your endurance.  However, Ripped & Chiseled is different in that Jari uses 2-3 consecutive exercises per muscle group, so each area really gets hit hard!Jari's background exercisers here include Gaylene from Ripped 1000 (who amazingly is 57 years old!), Judy, and Mike.  As with the other Ripped workouts, you have your choice of using different types of equipment, including dumbbells, a barbell, and weight plates.  Also, the weight loads for each exerciser are shown (this time BEFORE the exercise starts, which is great because it gives you time to set up) as well as the total number of repetitions.Again Jari uses a high number of repetitions with varied counts (singles, 2-2, 4-4, 3-1, 1-3, and pulses), but she adds some new twists here, such as high/low pulses on the squats and 1-7/7-1 counts on the triceps work.  There are a total of 15 exercise tracks as follows:1.  Warm-Up2.  Lunges3.  Squats4.  Stiff Leg Deadlift/Bent Knee Deadlift5.  Chest Press6.  Push Ups7.  Chest Fly8.  Back Track9.  Triceps Dips10. Skull Crushers11. Pull Overs12. Overhead Press13. Biceps14. Hammer Curls15. Cool DownWith the exception of the triceps dips, which is a bit shorter, each track averages around 4.5-5 minutes.  As you can see, there is no abs work, but the abs section from Slim & Lean (a nice quick abs routine consisting of 4 exercises performed in 2 sets), is included as a bonus.  The DVD Bonus features are as follows:  Abs Workout-Talking Nutrition-Healthy Recipes-Other Programs-Previews.Although this workout is similar to Slim & Lean, I enjoyed it much more; it just seemed to flow more smoothly, making the time, although lengthy, go by more quickly.  Although not as intense overall as Ripped 1000, which includes cardio, I believe that Ripped & Chiseled is Jari's most intense endurance workout to date.  Since you are working each muscle group several times before moving on, you will probably need to use lighter weights than with Jari's other workouts--even Jari & crew dropped to lower weights during the biceps section!  Therefore, this would not be a good workout to use as part of a heavy lifting routine.The best thing about this workout was that I felt great after I was done!  Definitely an excellent endurance workout for intermediate to advanced exercisers; highly recommended.",5,Jari's most challenging endurance workout yet!,1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,2644,"[""'m"", 'fairly', 'new', 'Jari', 'workouts', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'enjoying', 'love', 'how', 'work', 'hard', 'yet', ""n't"", 'kill', 'was', 'thrilled', 'be', 'able', 'preview', 'newest', 'video', 'Ripped', 'Chiseled', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'similar', 'Get', 'Ripped', 'Slim', 'Lean', 'long', 'workout', 'just', 'hour', 'really', 'endurance', 'However', 'Ripped', 'Chiseled', 'different', 'Jari', '2-3', 'consecutive', 'exercises', 'muscle', 'group', 'area', 'really', 'hit', 'hard', 'Jari', 'background', 'exercisers', 'here', 'include', 'Gaylene', 'Ripped', '1000', 'who', 'amazingly', '57', 'years', 'old', 'Judy', 'Mike', 'other', 'Ripped', 'workouts', 'have', 'choice', 'using', 'different', 'types', 'equipment', 'including', 'dumbbells', 'barbell', 'weight', 'plates', 'Also', 'weight', 'loads', 'exerciser', 'are', 'shown', 'time', 'exercise', 'great', 'time', 'set', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'total', 'number', 'repetitions.Again', 'Jari', 'high', 'number', 'repetitions', 'varied', 'counts', 'singles', '2-2', '4-4', '3-1', '1-3', 'pulses', 'new', 'twists', 'here', 'such', 'high/low', 'pulses', 'squats', '1-7/7-1', 'counts', 'triceps', 'work', 'are', 'total', '15', 'exercise', 'tracks', 'follows:1', 'Warm-Up2', 'Lunges3', 'Squats4', 'Stiff', 'Leg', 'Deadlift/Bent', 'Knee', 'Deadlift5', 'Chest', 'Press6', 'Push', 'Ups7', 'Chest', 'Fly8', 'Back', 'Track9', 'Triceps', 'Dips10', 'Skull', 'Crushers11', 'Pull', 'Overs12', 'Overhead', 'Press13', 'Biceps14', 'Hammer', 'Curls15', 'Cool', 'DownWith', 'exception', 'triceps', 'dips', 'bit', 'shorter', 'track', '4.5-5', 'minutes', 'can', 'see', 'abs', 'work', 'abs', 'section', 'Slim', 'Lean', 'nice', 'quick', 'abs', 'routine', 'consisting', '4', 'exercises', 'performed', '2', 'sets', 'included', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'Abs', 'Workout-Talking', 'Nutrition-Healthy', 'Recipes-Other', 'Programs-Previews.Although', 'workout', 'similar', 'Slim', 'Lean', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'seemed', 'flow', 'more', 'smoothly', 'making', 'time', 'lengthy', 'go', 'more', 'quickly', 'not', 'intense', 'overall', 'Ripped', '1000', 'cardio', 'believe', 'Ripped', 'Chiseled', 'Jari', 'most', 'intense', 'endurance', 'workout', 'date', 'are', 'working', 'muscle', 'group', 'several', 'times', 'moving', 'will', 'probably', 'need', 'use', 'lighter', 'weights', 'Jari', 'other', 'workouts', 'even', 'Jari', 'crew', 'dropped', 'lower', 'weights', 'biceps', 'section', 'Therefore', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'workout', 'use', 'part', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'routine.The', 'best', 'thing', 'workout', 'was', 'felt', 'great', 'was', 'done', 'Definitely', 'excellent', 'endurance', 'workout', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'highly', 'recommended']",Get Ripped! with Jari Love: Get Ripped & Chiseled

She may not be as vibrant and outgoing as a Christi Taylor or a Kari Anderson, but she is straight to business, get results instructor.  She could whip ANYONE into shape.This is another brilliant workout.  I have all her other workouts and this is up there with them.  You really fatigue your muscles here.  Free weights and high repetition to get the maximum burn.  If you are going through a plateau or such, then this will push you beyond it.  It's really helpful to get your metabolism up because there is so much intensity for your muscles.  The first time I did this, I could barely move the next day and in fact I still felt the effects of this for almost half a week.  All you need is weights, maybe a dumbell if you want and you can use a step as your weight bench.I thoroughly enjoyed this workout (yes, even through the fatigue and pain) because I know it's going to tone up almost any trouble spot and also because she is a good clear instructor who cues well.

1006910,AYEWU9TDE8HX3,B000GTJSVC,"Megan Alderton ""Home workout addict""","[3, 3]","Ok, here are a few recconmendations if you are contemplating buying this... first off, you will need a set of dumbbells in your weight range (I personally use anything from 2-10lbs, hoping to increase and need heavier weight soon), a step, a mat, and just about a 6"" by 6"" area to move I would say.  Great if you live in small quarters.  I know I do.  It will help if you are familiar with her exercises, but it is not necessary... you can learn as you go.  I would say beginners to advanced can use this because of the built in modifications and the ability for you to vary your weights.  Also, it would be best if you are not already sore before doing this!  It's pretty tough if you truly challenge yourself.You will see a good bit of repeat exercises from previous DVDs, it's true, but there was enough variety to keep me interested and going.  Skull crushers for instance I had never done before, and now love them because they certainly make you feel the burn in the triceps (a trouble spot for me).  I wish there had been a little bit more lower body work, but that was ok with me... I think she hits you hard enough with the squats and lunges in the beginning to make up for it.  Jari has a very good personality to me in this one... she just seems to have hit that right balance of being friendly, motivating and just a little chatty at times.  She is very relaxed in this one even though the workout is hard and that helps me keep my cool.  During the stretching segment she chats a lot with Gaylene and Mike.  I liked hearing other people's takes on Jari's workouts.  I was amazed and impressed to hear that Gaylene (who is also featured in Ripped 1000) is 57 and does not too carefully watch what she eats.  That made it seem more real to me that I can actually have Ripped results without totally giving up every yummy food I love!  No seriously, I do watch what I eat, but unlike Jari, I do have a treat once or twice a week such as ice cream or a small bowl of chips.  I doubt Jari has seen these foods since childhood.  Anyway, the stretching segment does get gyped a little because of this... you may just want to do your own stretching while you listen.There is no Abs workout on this, except for the Bonus Feature which is the Abs workout from Slim and Lean... which by the way is only about 5 minutes and is not the best, but it's ok if you want a quick fix for your abs.  I personally always do extra ab workouts after doing her DVDs... that's where all my fat seems to settle.Other bonus features include some nutritional informationa about portion sizes and some tips on what to eat, when to eat etc.  GREAT INFO!  Make sure you check this out.  Also, some delicous and healthy recipes included.  Get out some pen and paper to copy those down.One little gripe I had about this video was her selection of ""Judy"" to participate.  Judy hardly smiled and had a mean look on her face most of the time, but more than that, her form was sloppy in some exercises.  During the bicep track, I found myself yelling at her.  She was definetely swinging the barbell up using momentum and then smooshing herself in the boobs with it, releasing the contraction on the bicep. A good bicep curl requires that you control the movements up and down and you don't come up quite all the way... I know that's tough on 120 reps, but maybe she should have had lighter weight then!  It was just dissapointing because I have enjoyed seeing all the other Rippers and found them motivating.  Gaylene was great and knowing her age makes it even more admirable!Bottom line... great strength training here... small annoyances throughout should not impede you.  Seriously, Jari has a good thing going.  If you're questioning her methods or not sure if you wanna buy this or hang with her workouts, Please do so for at least a few weeks.  Believe me, when I first tried Slim and Lean a long time ago, I didn't like it, but I stuck with it... and for the first time in my life I have muscle definition instead of that soft pudgy look.  Go for it!!!! Good luck!",5,Supersets and high reps...

The only thing is, do not use weights or the step on the lunges because off the step they are quite challenging at first. Be sure to use your own body weight starting out, and build up from there. The first two exercises are for you lower body (lunges off the step and squats). Both tracks are very hard, so you are working hard right at the beginning. The rest of the tracks are for your upper body and back. I love the back track becuase you are really working your back muscle throughout. The last three tracks are by far the hardest, all working your upper body into ripped and chisled muscles. The shoulder presses fried my biceps and shoulders! Overall, a great workout.

I've been doing the Jillian Michaels DVD for the last month and wanted to try this one to possibly target my muscles in a different way. The video DEFINITELY targets your muscles in a profound way, but the main reason I only gave it 3 stars is that, out of all 15 circuits, there is NO abs workout!Jari does sheepishly mention about 4/5ths of the way through the video that ""we've been working our abs the whole time"" (indirectly, I guess), but that sounded to me like a pretty lame excuse for not delivering on one of the MOST ESSENTIAL elements of any circuit training workout.  Anyway, the video starts with a pretty decent warm-up and ends with a cool down that is rather inadequate given the level of intensity of the exercises.  The work out is very heavy on the upper body (arms) and by comparison only minimally targets the lower body (glutes, quads, and hammies).  In order to get some balance, I had to basically substitute some of the ab and glute exercises I learned from Jillian Michaels' DVD during the last 4 segments (rather than keep hammering away at my poor arms!).Also, the women in this video, including Jari, look truly frightening!  I think they might be body builders or something by trade.  But it also looks like they've had a LOT of plastic surgery done (I mean, natural human skin just ain't that tight and shiny...especially not at their age!).  I spent the first half of the workout preoccupied with the fear that I might actually end up LOOKING like these women, which was kinda distracting.  The music was also annoying, though not overly intrusive. Jari tries to be encouraging throughout the workout, but clearly isn't a natural at this, so instead she just keeps reminding us over and over again that the buildup of lactic acid in our muscles will break us out of our plateau.I would recommend this video for folks who want to spend an hour targeting their arms and don't mind a shallow, phony LA vibe.  For those who want a more balanced workout that is equally (or more) challenging, try Jillian Michaels or someone else.

Now my collection is complete!  woo-hoo!There are some new moves in this one & your muscles will feel it.  i know mine sure did!  I guess after months & months of the same moves i got kind of used to the workouts. (i was rotating slim & lean & ripped to the core)  Well I just did ripped & chiseled for the 1st time 2 days ago & am still sore.  man did i feel it!  I am glad i got ripped & chiseled to add to my rotation, i am sure it's going to be a great addition.  Now i can't wait to test out ripped 1000 (which i watched part of the way through.  it has cardio mixed in with the weight training. Nice!)I guess the ripped & chiseled is most similar to slim & lean in the type of format, being highest reps with no cardio or tough compound moves.  I noticed afterwards that i didn't sweat as much as i thought i would.  I seem to sweat profusely through ripped to the core & sweat a bit through slim & lean.  After this workout i was basically dry.  but my muscles were fatigued, especially my upper body.  i noticed more arm/chest/back exercizes, and i feel soreness mostly in the upper body.  I wanted some more arm toning so that's fine with me!  i'll just do ripped 1000 next since she mixes in cardio.A Downfall is that there is no abs.  As others have stated, she threw in the slim & lean abs segment as an extra.  You have the option to do that after the workout is over.  I just wish it was tacked on before the stretching instead of having to play it afterwards but that is my only gripe.Overall i really like all her videos, they are all different & it's good to have variety to mix it up.  but i must say i am a huge ripped to the core fan because of the compound moves.  They really get my heart-rate up & i feel it in my whole body going up & down off the step (you can do it without a step but it's not as effective. trying to stay balanced going up & down off the step works your abs the whole time. Actually i use a BOSU instead of step & that makes it even more challenging.)

As a matter of fact, it is probably my favorite birthday present this year... and I even got a computer. ;-)This workout, though deemed strength training, can also be used as cardio assuming you put enough into it. I find that when I truly challenge myself and really put my heart into this workout that it gets my pulse up and keeps it up through a majority of the DVD. That said, this workout is definitely very challenging and by the end of each track I find that each muscle group being worked is trembling. Jari has a great personality and really does well to encourage without being annoying. I like the way she explains and teaches throughout the DVD. The best thing about the workout is that you can NOT plateau. If you feel that you are plateauing then you simply get heavier weights.I highly recommend this workout! It is exceptionally challenging but every bit worth it!",5,A Must-Have for all Fitness Enthusiasts!!!,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,975,"['received', 'DVD', 'birthday', 'February', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'disappointed', 'matter', 'fact', 'probably', 'favorite', 'birthday', 'present', 'year', 'even', 'got', 'computer', 'workout', 'deemed', 'strength', 'training', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'used', 'cardio', 'assuming', 'put', 'enough', 'find', 'when', 'truly', 'challenge', 'really', 'put', 'heart', 'workout', 'pulse', 'up', 'up', 'majority', 'DVD', 'said', 'workout', 'definitely', 'very', 'challenging', 'end', 'track', 'find', 'muscle', 'group', 'being', 'worked', 'trembling', 'Jari', 'great', 'personality', 'really', 'well', 'encourage', 'being', 'annoying', 'way', 'teaches', 'DVD', 'best', 'thing', 'workout', 'can', 'NOT', 'plateau', 'feel', 'are', 'plateauing', 'then', 'simply', 'get', 'heavier', 'weights.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'workout', 'exceptionally', 'challenging', 'bit']",Get Ripped! with Jari Love: Get Ripped & Chiseled
