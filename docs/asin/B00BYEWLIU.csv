The season ended with the family at peace. Season two was lively, especially with the dealings with Savonarola and Juan Borgia's failures with Caterina Sforza. It ends with a huge cliff hanger, the poisoning of Papa Alexander VI. I don't think it is too big a spoiler to say that his life is saved in Episode 1, by Lucrezia (hinting at her knowledge of poisons, for which she is famous.)What seems to work better in season 3 is the sense, over the 10 episodes, that we are finally working toward a climax with is advantageous to the Borgias. We even see, perhaps a bit more clearly, how their various stratagems work or do not work, and how Lucrezia especially got her reputation.The problem of dealing with all the different names and characters is cleared up a bit, since so many of them are familiar to us now. It's remarkable how many of the most interesting characters are real, historic figures, such as Niccolo Machiavelli (who is perhaps more famous today than any other character in that era) and  Michelotto Corella, Cesere's right hand man, spy, bodyguard, and assassin. Machiavelli did make several mentions of the Borgia schemes in his work, &#34;The Prince&#34; but I'm not sure he was as much of an ally of the Borgias as this series makes him out to be, and I know he was not an agent of the de Medici rulers of FlorenceThe series could have ended with the death of Alexander VI, since his reign was only 13 years long, but it doesn't. It ends with the Borgias at a high point in their career.One thing I love about this series, in contrast to &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;, is that it fields goodly sized armies, and its battles do not take place in the dark. I'm especially fond of how cleverly a siege is carried out. I really hope that is an historically accurate scene. There is one scene involving ships which is very similar to a scene near the end of Season 2 in &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;. &#34;The Borgias&#34; carries it off with greater drama and cinematography.There is little value to buying the third season if you have not seen the first and second seasons, as you will miss all the background of the enmity between Naples and Rome and the Sforzas and the Borgias and the alliances between Rome and France.",5,"Episode by episode, the best season of the three, as there is a clear trajectory from disaster to triumph.",1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,2350,"['34', 'Borgias', '34', 'began', 'bang', 'showing', 'chicanery', 'election', 'Rodrigo', 'Borgia', 'Papacy', 'season', 'ended', 'family', 'peace', 'Season', 'two', 'was', 'lively', 'especially', 'dealings', 'Savonarola', 'Juan', 'Borgia', 'failures', 'Caterina', 'Sforza', 'huge', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'poisoning', 'Papa', 'Alexander', 'VI', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'big', 'spoiler', 'say', 'life', 'saved', 'Episode', '1', 'Lucrezia', 'hinting', 'knowledge', 'poisons', 'famous', 'What', 'work', 'better', 'season', '3', 'sense', '10', 'episodes', 'are', 'finally', 'working', 'climax', 'advantageous', 'Borgias', 'even', 'see', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'more', 'clearly', 'how', 'various', 'stratagems', 'work', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'how', 'Lucrezia', 'especially', 'got', 'reputation.The', 'problem', 'dealing', 'different', 'names', 'characters', 'cleared', 'up', 'bit', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'familiar', 'now', 'remarkable', 'how', 'many', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'historic', 'figures', 'such', 'Niccolo', 'Machiavelli', 'who', 'perhaps', 'more', 'famous', 'today', 'other', 'character', 'era', 'Michelotto', 'Corella', 'Cesere', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'spy', 'bodyguard', 'assassin', 'Machiavelli', 'did', 'make', 'several', 'mentions', 'Borgia', 'schemes', 'work', '34', 'Prince', '34', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'ally', 'Borgias', 'series', 'out', 'be', 'know', 'was', 'not', 'agent', 'de', 'Medici', 'rulers', 'FlorenceThe', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'death', 'Alexander', 'VI', 'reign', 'was', 'only', '13', 'years', 'long', ""n't"", 'Borgias', 'high', 'point', 'career.One', 'thing', 'love', 'series', 'contrast', '34', 'Game', 'Thrones', '34', 'goodly', 'sized', 'armies', 'battles', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'dark', ""'m"", 'especially', 'fond', 'how', 'cleverly', 'siege', 'carried', 'really', 'hope', 'historically', 'accurate', 'scene', 'one', 'scene', 'involving', 'ships', 'very', 'similar', 'scene', 'end', 'Season', '2', '34', 'Game', 'Thrones', '34', '34', 'Borgias', '34', 'off', 'greater', 'drama', 'little', 'value', 'buying', 'third', 'season', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'will', 'miss', 'background', 'enmity', 'Naples', 'Rome', 'Sforzas', 'Borgias', 'alliances', 'Rome', 'France']",N/A

I read through the book in less than the 10 hours of Season One.  We've now been watching the three seasons of the Borgias DVD for nearly thirty hours and I don't think we are half way through the book.  Producers have made a fatal flaw in slowing down the story to this pace and historical series won't sustain the 8 seasons it would take to complete the story.

The casting is great, the acting very good,the pacing and cinematography are excellent.  The final season presumably would have shownCesare obtaining his own little kingdom (which he wasn't able to hold onto), and perhaps the deathof his father the pope.  Alexander VI's papacy lasted only about 6 years.The &#34;special features&#34; are remarkably thin.  Showtime pretty much shoved the final season out thedoor to DVD and Blu-Ray as cheaply as possible to pick up the extra revenue.  There are a bunchof trailers (all of which simply reprise scenes you see in the series) and interviews with six or sevenof the actors (I would have enjoyed hearing an interview with the actor who played Micheletto but, it'snot there.  It would have been great if they included maybe a half-hour special on the actual history,perhaps to the end of Cesare's life and the family's effect on the rest of Europe--but, no.

1641161,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B00BYEWLIU,"Ray ""A Reader""","[1, 1]","The Borgias is a Showtime period drama set in late 15th century Rome. The specific focus of the show concerns Rodrigo Borgias' ascent to the papacy and his efforts to stay in power through the turbulent events of the period.The show commences in 1492, the year that Alexander VI became Pope. Of course, most people will also recognize that year as the same in which Columbus discovered the New World. This date therefore provides an easy connection to the historical timeline that most people can easily relate to. Once Borgia becomes Alexander VI, the saga begins, and the series describes the machinations made to maintain Alexander Sixtus on the throne. This is a difficult and sometimes brutal history, and those that are familiar with this history will not be surprised at the events that unfold in the subsequent episodes. The show is largely historically accurate, both in the broad brush strokes and also in some of the minute details.Season Three picks up with the dramatic ending from the last episode of Season Two, and continues to play out the historical drama to a relative high level of accuracy from the actual historical record. There are some dramatic licenses taken, but they appear to be few and far between. It's unfortunate, though, that the series was cancelled during this season before the fourth season could be made, because we can here more clearly seen the story arc as it would have unfolded in that last planned season. But the show's cancellation should not be a reason to not get the released three seasons, because the series has a great amount of content that it tells, and you'll find yourself having a mini history lesson as you watch the show unfold.There is little reason to repeat the expansive written information that has already been provided about this series by other reviewers, including the specific details covered in each episode. We can easily confirm, however, the extremely high quality production values of the show. We can also echo the view that the acting in the show is extremely well done. As companies like Showtime, HBO, and Netflix continue to make extremely lush, well-developed dramas, we see that this trend has now achieved the pinnacle of television production at this current time, one that is now rivaling, and sometimes, surpassing, full screen movies. This is also the case with The Borgias. This is a show that is supremely well done, and it shows in every scene. The art sets, the costumes, the colors, the settings, and on and on are superbly well done. In fact, it seems we are watching here something of a quality level that would not even normally be seen in a full screen movie.The acting, of course, is of greatest importance, and we see with an outstanding cast including Jeremy Irons that the cast are up to every bit of the task and make the story come alive on the screen. It has been rumored that the show cost Showtime approximately $2.5 million per episode to make. That runs out to roughly $25 million per season. When you watch the show on a high definition television BluRay player, you can see where some of that money was spent. The show is lush, lavish, and it makes one marvel at how such shows are being made  today. Filming was carried out primarily in Hungary, and there is some use of CGI and certain scenes, but these are barely noticeable, and in fact sometimes are not noticeable at all. The architectural backgrounds to many of the scenes are simply superb, even when they are CGI.The Borgias had a loyal following for the first three seasons on Showtime. However, in a trend that we have heard all too often before, ratings were not as high as Showtime had hoped, particularly in Season Three. The show was originally slated for a four season run, but because the ratings were slightly disappointing in Season Three, Showtime decided to cancel the series at the end of the third season. This means that the planned Season Four of The Borgias does not exist, and likely will never be made. (This is not unlike the situation that occurred with the critically acclaimed show ""Boss,"" starring Kelsey Grammer, which was canceled after two seasons because of low ratings, but was considered to be one of the best dramatic shows on television in recent memory.) But in spite of the disappointment that no Season Four is to be made, this is no reason not to watch The Borgias for those first three seasons. (The same is true of Boss, as well; watching its first two seasons can be an amazing experience, in spite of the truncated ending of the show.)The Borgias is an excellent historical drama that will help you to learn much about the period, and the papacy of Alexander VI. It has some difficult scenes, but the show has seemingly done a reasonable job of attempting to portray the story without making it so consistently brutal that one would not wish to watch it. Watching the show in Blu-ray format with a high-definition television can provide some of the sharpest clearest and most colorful presentations that we've seen to date.This is an easy five-star recommendation for anyone enjoying historical dramas, or for those interested in the period.",5,The Borgias Returns for a Third Season,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,5149,"['Borgias', 'Showtime',

Season 1 and 2 were so gripping my wife and I often stayed up hours later than intended because we just couldn't peel ourselves away from the show, but we were not going to bed so late on this season.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the season, but the script seemed a bit different as if they changed writers...?  I love the costumes and the entire set.  It seems very authentic.On a historical note, I really wonder how accurate this is.  I know this is a work of fiction based on some historical facts and a producer's view to make it more entertaining...I'm not a historian, but Giuliano Della Rovere was recorded as trying to kill Rodrigo Borgia multiple times to 'cleanse' the Chair of St. Peters and was upset that HE had not won the title of Pope himself.  Like the narrator says in the beginning of the movie &#34;Braveheart&#34;, history is written by those kings/rulers that win the wars and live the longest, and the history written by the Pope (Giuliano Della Rovere) after Rodrigo Borgia died would carry enough weight to be believed through centuries, right?  The Borgia's were portrayed as being able to murder and poison almost anybody they wished at any time they wished, so why was Giuliano Della Rovere able to survive so long and so many attempts on his life?  Further, after Rodrigo Borgia passed, Giuliano Della Rovere again did not become Pope.  What happened to this Pope...?  He lived for ~18 days (or 23?  I don't remember exactly) before being killed, and then Giuliano Della Rovere was finally named Pope and ruled for many years after.  Also, Giuliano Della Rovere had a father or grandfather that had been Pope, and from what little reading I've done, he seemed to almost think he should have been named Pope, almost as if he was the heir apparent to the Chair of St. Peters.  I don't know if I'm right, but you have to admit, it is a little fishy since Giuliano Della Rovere had many years to tell tales to people recording history.

I know in the end it came down to budget, but why start something, try to keep it as authentic as possible, and then abandon it? It's sad because this series is beyond beautiful. Lush, and jarring and opulent. So nearly perfect. Sure, it's not very historically accurate...in fact, hardly at all. But I was so utterly hooked way back in season 1, that it truly didn't matter all that much to me. The characters are intriguing, the costumes, to die for. The acting is just superb, once again thanks to Jeremy Irons who just HAS to be ridicuolusly perfect no matter who he plays. The entire supporting cast is honestly just as good, with extra attention paid to Sean Harris who plays Micheletto with such a sad, but ferocious spirit. So many heartbreaking moments here in this Season. Just the intrigue and mystery, war and incest, angst galore, is enough to constitute The Borgias as one of the most well-done series in quite a long while. Neil Jordan is just so good at what he does. He knows exactly how to set the mood, how to toy with the audience. It's maddeningly delirious and it really is a shame to end it like this. Though I must say, the ending was sublimely delicious, and not a cliffhanger in sight. But then again, what constitutes an ending?
