It must apply to all times - time immemorial, current and future eras. And indeed, Mughal-e-Azam fits this difficult requirement. Eternal epic themes and conflicts abound: the power of love; most significantly, the all-encompassing blinding power of love&loving-; even against all odds; devotion to duty&responsibilities; versus attending/acquiescing to the needs& desires of one's loved ones;  the struggle of sons against fathers; the love of mothers for their offspring; the loyalty of a wife  towards a husband versus the loyalty of a mother  towards her child/children; jealousy and its twin, hatred; loyalty to friends, even to the death; a philosopher, truth-sayer, and upholder of ethics (in this case, the sculptor).The acting is very believable.

1022614,A2UJG6T6DOWKQF,B000IZJRIS,Jennifer Hopfinger,"[2, 2]","'Mughal-E-Azam' is a history-making Indian film about some of the most fascinating figures in Indian history: the Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great, who ruled India in the 16th century, his eldest son Salim, and Salim's lover Anarkali.The legend of Anarkali is a beloved tale in India and the subject of paintings, literature, and films. Given the disputable history of her existence, there are different versions of her life story. Many believe she was Akbar's concubine and possibly even the mother of his youngest son, Daniyal. As the story goes, Salim, the future Emperor Jahagir, fell in love with Anarkali, the couple had a scandalous affair, and the outraged Akbar buried her alive behind a palace wall.The purported liaison aside, there's no question that Akbar and Salim had a highly contentious relationship. Salim was born to Akbar after years of childlessness and beseeching prayer, and the boy gave his father nothing but trouble thereafter. Salim struggled with alcoholism his whole life and openly rebelled against Akbar, even once leading a military revolt. But Akbar forgave him and named him his heir.The actor who played Salim in 'Mughal-E-Azam' is Dilip Kumar--a legend himself--one of the greatest actors of all time. Anarkali was played by Kumar's real-life lover, Madhubala--an Indian actress of world-renown who was sought by Hollywood filmmakers during her heyday. She died of a heart defect at the age of 36--and was already suffering from the condition during the making of 'Mughal-E-Azam'--one of many associated with the film who died prematurely, including the director, K. Asif, who only completed two films before his death. 'Mughal-E-Azam' was 15 years in the making--partly because the first male lead died and was replaced by Kumar and partly because of the unprecedented lavishness of the production. Part of the film was shot in color--new technology at the time. In 2004, it was entirely colorized and became the first colorized feature film in the world to be re-released in theaters. At the time of its original release, the film set a box-office record that wasn't broken until 1975 by the blockbuster Amitabh Bachchan-starrer 'Sholay.'In this film version of the story of Anarkali, she is not Akbar's concubine, but a humble maidservant in his harem. She and Salim share passionate stolen moments in the palace's pleasure gardens--until Akbar finds out that his son is inappropriately dallying with a woman beneath his rank. The emperor throws her in prison when Salim insists on marrying her. The standoff between the two men escalates into full-scale war. Kumar's smoldering Salim and Madhubala's enamored Anarkali burn up the screen.The early years of Akbar's reign are the subject of a recent Bollywood film, 'Jodhaa Akbar' (2008), starring Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai.- The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",5,Must See Classic,1269993600,"03 31, 2010",2010,2909,"[""'Mughal-E-Azam"", 'history-making', 'Indian', 'film', 'most', 'fascinating', 'figures', 'Indian', 'history', 'Mughal', 'Emperor', 'Akbar', 'Great', 'who', 'ruled', 'India', '16th', 'century', 'eldest', 'son', 'Salim', 'Salim', 'lover', 'Anarkali.The', 'legend', 'Anarkali', 'beloved', 'tale', 'India', 'subject', 'paintings', 'literature', 'films', 'Given', 'disputable', 'history', 'existence', 'are', 'different', 'versions', 'life', 'story', 'Many', 'believe', 'was', 'Akbar', 'concubine', 'possibly', 'even', 'mother', 'youngest', 'son', 'Daniyal', 'story', 'Salim', 'future', 'Emperor', 'Jahagir', 'fell', 'love', 'Anarkali', 'couple', 'had', 'scandalous', 'affair', 'outraged', 'Akbar', 'buried', 'alive', 'palace', 'wall.The', 'purported', 'liaison', 'aside', 'question', 'Akbar', 'Salim', 'had', 'highly', 'contentious', 'relationship', 'Salim', 'was', 'born', 'Akbar', 'years', 'childlessness', 'beseeching', 'prayer', 'boy', 'gave', 'father', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'thereafter', 'Salim', 'struggled', 'alcoholism', 'whole', 'life', 'openly', 'rebelled', 'Akbar', 'even', 'once', 'leading', 'military', 'revolt', 'Akbar', 'forgave', 'named', 'heir.The', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Salim', ""'Mughal-E-Azam"", 'Dilip', 'Kumar', 'legend', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'time', 'Anarkali', 'was', 'played', 'Kumar', 'real-life', 'lover', 'Madhubala', 'Indian', 'actress', 'world-renown', 'who', 'was', 'sought', 'Hollywood', 'filmmakers', 'heyday', 'died', 'heart', 'defect', 'age', '36', 'was', 'already', 'suffering', 'condition', 'making', ""'Mughal-E-Azam"", 'one', 'many', 'associated', 'film', 'who', 'died', 'prematurely', 'including', 'director', 'K.', 'Asif', 'who', 'only', 'completed', 'two', 'films', 'death', ""'Mughal-E-Azam"", 'was', '15', 'years', 'making', 'partly', 'first', 'male', 'lead', 'died', 'was', 'replaced', 'Kumar', 'partly', 'unprecedented', 'lavishness', 'production', 'Part', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'color', 'new', 'technology', 'time', '2004', 'was', 'entirely', 'colorized', 'became', 'first', 'colorized', 'feature', 'film', 'world', 'be', 're-released', 'theaters', 'time', 'original', 'release', 'film', 'set', 'box-office', 'record', 'was', ""n't"", 'broken', '1975', 'blockbuster', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan-starrer', ""'Sholay"", ""'In"", 'film', 'version', 'story', 'Anarkali', 'not', 'Akbar', 'concubine', 'humble', 'maidservant', 'harem', 'Salim', 'share', 'passionate', 'stolen', 'moments', 'palace', 'pleasure', 'gardens', 'Akbar', 'out', 'son', 'inappropriately', 'dallying', 'woman', 'rank', 'emperor', 'prison', 'when', 'Salim', 'marrying', 'standoff', 'two', 'men', 'full-scale', 'war', 'Kumar', 'smoldering', 'Salim', 'Madhubala', 'enamored', 'Anarkali', 'burn', 'up', 'screen.The', 'early', 'years', 'Akbar', 'reign', 'are', 'subject', 'recent', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'Akbar', '2008', 'starring', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai.-', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",N/A

1022618,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B000IZJRIS,The Mysterious Traveler,"[5, 6]","MUGHAL-E-AZAM(1960) Directed by K. Asif.In the late 1500s, India was under the absolute domination of theMuslim Moghuls(the descendents of the Mongols) the current Emperorbeing Akbar the Great. After Allah grants his wish to grant him anheir, Akbar finds raising a son difficult both as a father and more soas an emperor. And when Selim falls in love with Anarkali, a beautifulslave girl, and determines to marry her, Akbar's opposition leads tomuch palace intrigue, civil war and, as this is an Indian film, a greatdeal of singing. But alas it is all destined to end tragically as thesethings often do.............Considered a classic if not the greatest film in the history ofBollywood, this picture---though unwisely colorized for the DVDrelease---is certainly an undeniable masterpiece and an example of whatused to be called the magic of the movies. Except for perhaps theending, this film is magificently acted, directed, scripted and withstaggering set design. Though there is singing, the numbers are---forthe most part---organic to the story rather than intrusive and---forthe most part---the musical numbers are wildly Golden Age of Hollywoodmusical impressive and addictive.And yet make no mistake, this is a historical epic of gigantic scope.It is amusing to read film reviewers who smugly mock the Arabian Nightstype films made in Hollywood during the 40s and 50s frequently starringMaria Montez and Jon Hall as being silly and ""campy"" and yet when oneactually sees a film set during the same period and in the Orientand/orMiddle East and MADE by the natives of those countries/cultures,they turn out to be much the same.......only with a bigger budget andlonger. This exact same film could easily have been made by UniversalInternational starring Yvonne DeCarlo and Jeff Chandler.........andwould be dismissed today. But no one dismisses this film.Politically Correct Anti-American hypocrisy.Interestingly enough--like those aforementioned American films--whilethis film makes for an enticing and dazzling introduction to a part ofworld history the average American probably have never heard of before,it is also...like those American films---more concerned with the exoticand the romantic than with accuracy. The film presents a highlypolished and scrubed clean version of Akbar and the Moghul Empire.Since Akbar was a Muslim and a Jihadist and treated Hindus pretty muchthe way one might guess(Though to be fair, he was closer to Kruschevthan Stalin in his mass murderering tendencies--perhaps all thatsinging distracted him???), the film is a bit surprising in itsthorough whitewash even pulling back a bit from its full tragedyapparently only to mitigate Akbar's actions. One would have thought theHindus in India might have been irked at the glorification of someonewho wished them nothing but ill. However exactly like those Americanfilms, Islamic Barbarism is given a complete pass. Perhaps the Muslimsthreatened to kill someone unless the script was altered??That stated. For those who have never heard of Akbar or know little ofhistory of India, this is not an issue. And for those who do, it can beparsed since the film does not deny what Akbar did to Hindus, it simplydoes not mention it.A perfect introduction to Bollywood, the film is a glorious cinematicexperience and should be seen by all who love the Historical Epic andwho love the movies.Highly recommended.",5,A colorful Musical Romp about a Genocidal Islamic Savage.,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,3390,"['MUGHAL-E-AZAM', '1960', 'Directed', 'K.', 'Asif.In', 'late', '1500s', 'India', 'was', 'absolute', 'domination', 'theMuslim', 'Moghuls', 'descendents', 'Mongols', 'current', 'Emperorbeing', 'Akbar', 'Great', 'Allah', 'grants', 'wish', 'grant', 'anheir', 'Akbar', 'raising', 'son', 'difficult', 'father', 'more', 'soas', 'emperor', 'when', 'Selim', 'love', 'Anarkali', 'beautifulslave', 'girl', 'determines', 'marry', 'Akbar', 'opposition', 'tomuch', 'palace', 'intrigue', 'civil', 'war', 'Indian', 'film', 'greatdeal', 'singing', 'destined', 'end', 'tragically', 'thesethings', 'often', 'do', '.Considered', 'classic', 'not', 'greatest', 'film', 'history', 'ofBollywood', 'picture', 'unwisely', 'colorized', 'DVDrelease', '-is', 'certainly', 'undeniable', 'masterpiece', 'example', 'whatused', 'be', 'called', 'magic', 'movies', 'perhaps', 'theending', 'film', 'magificently', 'acted', 'directed', 'scripted', 'withstaggering', 'set', 'design', 'singing', 'numbers', 'are', 'most', 'part', '-organic', 'story', 'rather', 'intrusive', '-forthe', 'most', 'part', '-the', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'wildly', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Hollywoodmusical', 'impressive', 'addictive.And', 'yet', 'make', 'mistake', 'historical', 'epic', 'gigantic', 'scope.It', 'amusing', 'read', 'film', 'reviewers', 'who', 'smugly', 'mock', 'Arabian', 'Nightstype', 'films', 'made', 'Hollywood', '40s', '50s', 'frequently', 'starringMaria', 'Montez', 'Jon', 'Hall', 'being', 'silly', 'campy', 'yet', 'when', 'oneactually', 'film', 'set', 'same', 'period', 'Orientand/orMiddle', 'East', 'MADE', 'natives', 'countries/cultures', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'same', '.only', 'bigger', 'budget', 'andlonger', 'exact', 'same', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'UniversalInternational', 'starring', 'Yvonne', 'DeCarlo', 'Jeff', 'Chandler', 'andwould', 'be', 'dismissed', 'today', 'one', 'film.Politically', 'Correct', 'Anti-American', 'hypocrisy.Interestingly', 'enough', 'aforementioned', 'American', 'films', 'whilethis', 'film', 'enticing', 'dazzling', 'introduction', 'part', 'ofworld', 'history', 'average', 'American', 'probably', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'also', 'American', 'films', '-more', 'concerned', 'exoticand', 'romantic', 'accuracy', 'film', 'highlypolished', 'scrubed', 'clean', 'version', 'Akbar', 'Moghul', 'Empire.Since', 'Akbar', 'was', 'Muslim', 'Jihadist', 'treated', 'Hindus', 'pretty', 'muchthe', 'way', 'one', 'might', 'guess', 'be', 'fair', 'was', 'closer', 'Kruschevthan', 'Stalin', 'mass', 'murderering', 'tendencies', 'perhaps', 'thatsinging', 'distracted', 'film', 'bit', 'surprising', 'itsthorough', 'whitewash', 'even', 'pulling', 'back', 'bit', 'full', 'tragedyapparently', 'only', 'mitigate', 'Akbar', 'actions', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'theHindus', 'India', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'irked', 'glorification', 'someonewho', 'wished', 'nothing', 'ill', 'However', 'exactly', 'Americanfilms', 'Islamic', 'Barbarism', 'given', 'complete', 'pass', 'Perhaps', 'Muslimsthreatened', 'kill', 'someone', 'script', 'was', 'altered', 'stated', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Akbar', 'know', 'little', 'ofhistory', 'India', 'not', 'issue', 'who', 'do', 'can', 'beparsed', 'film', 'not', 'deny', 'what', 'Akbar', 'did', 'Hindus', 'not', 'mention', 'it.A', 'perfect', 'introduction', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'glorious', 'cinematicexperience', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'who', 'love', 'Historical', 'Epic', 'love', 'movies.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1022619,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B000IZJRIS,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[3, 3]","Now, I don't claim to be an expert on India, Bollywood, or films in general; but I do consider myself a passionate student of different cultures and films. When I first discovered Bollywood throughJodhaa Akbar (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)this film came up in my ""research."" While, Mr. Gowariker's epic masterpiece focused on Akbar's early years consolidating his empire, and promoting religious tolerance with national unity, Mr. Asif focuses on the twilight of his reign with all the strife that came with it. But is any of it true? Well, from a certain point of view, as a wise old Jedi once said.Akbar WAS one of the great rulers of history. He created one of the world's great empires, and was hailed by his contemporaries for his humane edicts and revolutionary (for the time) tolerance. Okay, by modern standards he was a tyrant, but I never understood judging history by modern standards. Akbar also had a traumatic family life, he lost several children while he was still mostly a child himself, and by the time he'd gotten his kingdom established, was in desperate need of children. He did make a pilgrimage to his favorite ""saint"" and Jodhaa did eventually give birth to Salim the first of several rebellious, dissolute, and trouble-making sons. And yes, Akbar fought and forgave his Salim for many acts of betrayal. However, falling in love with the court dancing girl wasn't one of them. So I'll give this movie props for portraying a fairly accurate dysfunctional relationship between father and son.This film is a marvel in so many ways, just don't expect it to look as great as it is. In the fifties Mr. Asif wanted to make the entire film in color, but cash constraints and time commitments made it impossible. So, the two songs in the climax were shot in color, and the rest in black and white. Let me state, that the original color sequences are lovely! In 2004 they re-mastered the film for Dolbey Sound and Color, I'm not going to call it a mistake. The point was to bring the creator's original intent to the screen, that deserves applause. It's not a bad color job, I've seen so much worse! But it's not worthy of the content. In the bonus disk they show clips of the B&W; version and you can see how great the details here in the sets and costumes. Maybe some day they'll try again with enough money and the right technology to get it right.But Color or no color this movie was a beast to make! It took ten years! No CGI, no special effects, no crazy stunt work, no green screen motion capture work. Nothing that we think would make a movie so hard to make. The opening scene shows a middle-aged Akbar walking in the desert barefoot with a huge Royal retinue behind him. Historically, this is a recorded event, but for this scene, the legendary actor Prithviraj Kapoor (great grandfather of Kareena Kapoor-Khan and sire of the entire Kapoor Bollywood dynasty) was walking barefoot in the real Rajasthan desert. According to one of his sons on the special features, he suffered a great deal. I believe that!Madhubala shot her prison scenes in real iron chains, and stayed in them to make sure her real pain made it to the screen. Okay, we've heard of actors doing some insane things for a role, but consider this, she did it knowing she had a bad heart. In addition she danced like a whirling dervish, and endured a reel and real-life love tragedy. Finally, It couldn't have been fun to be decked out in heavy jewels during long hours and hot lights. Neither Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan or Hrithik Roshan relished it decades later. And their movie didn't take ten years to make!To be honest, I was afraid this wouldn't live up to the hype. I'm a girl who finds ""Citizen Kane"" boring, so I'm wary of films that have a claim of being 'The Best of All Time' even if they are technically brilliant. For me, if I don't like any of the characters, or the story, then it's not the best period. My fears were compounded by the fact that I've seen a few Bollywood films from the 70's and 80's and thus far, only two made me feel like I didn't waste my time, and I only felt one was very good. It turns out that I had nothing to worry about. Is this movie perfect? No. No movie is. But it is everything it's lauded for.The script is pure poetry, you can hear that even when you're relying on subtitles. Now I don't usually rely on them too heavily, I've watched so much Bollywood that I've picked up the main ideas in Hindi over time, but for this movie I'll need them for at least ten more watches. The film is mainly in Urdu, not Hindi. Now the two languages are similar in some ways which isn't surprising, but I needed the subtitles to pick up details. One thing is certain, you rarely find scripts this good in Bollywood today, and I say that as a rabid fan! I think it's a darn shame that so few in Bollywood really take the time to write exceptional scripts, forcing the actors and the music to raise it up.I think that's a good introduction to the performances...This movie belongs to Maduhbala! It is her performance that grounds this movie emotionally and she is the character you root for above all others. She runs an emotional gambit exquisitely, never overselling her expressions or her mannerisms. In this epic surrounded by grandeur, and larger-than-life personalities, she is an oasis of passion wrapped in a serenity given by a complete conviction in her character. In her day, she was considered the ""Venus"" of Bollywood. Her beauty was unmatched, her love life fodder for a hungry press, does that sound familiar? She was the Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan of the age! Until, Mughal-e-Azam regarded mostly as a beauty, underrated as an artist, and praised for her dancing. If only life could have been a little kinder to her, be it in health, or in love. I'm now a fan, just as I am of her modern-day counterpart. She's perfect in this film, I can't think of one moment where I wasn't completely convinced that she was Anarkali, and I loved her! I just can't say the same for prince Salim.Dilip Kumar might not be what I consider handsome, but I totally understand why Amitabh Bachchan considers him his acting idol, and Aamir Khan is a mega-fan. Great actors make you care about the character, even if you don't particularly like them. I don't particularly like Salim, he's the type that wants what he wants, when he wants it. Well, duh, he's a prince! He does have some layers, he's a warrior, and a poet, and he's got some wit as well. The major problem with Salim is that he's got one major irritating flaw, he's not inclined to see things from anyone's point-of-view but his own. For example, Anarkali is very aware that their relationship is hardly a good idea. She's concerned about his honor, the kingdom, his relationship with his parents. His one and only thought is 'I want her, she loves me!' This is bad enough, but not only is he stubborn, he's also not inclined to be diplomatic or use any methods of trying to convince his parents that marrying Anarkali won't destroy the kingdom that could possibly work! That said, he makes you admire his courage and his commitment, to his love. His way of delivering dialogue is exquisite, and the Real love tragically cut short between leading man and leading lady sizzles on the screen.Prithviraj Kapoor: Oh this one is hard for me! I mean, my very first experience with Akbar has been completely defined by Hrithik Roshan! The visual alone creates an indelible impact. But this is the patriarch of a dynasty, and a legendary actor at the time this movie was made. So did he shatter my image of a Greek-God-like Akbar with smoldering eyes, and a pure and passionate heart? No, he enhanced it! Even with a rather unfortunate mole on an equally unfortunate nose. I won't say that Prithviraj Kapoor's performance provided a template for Roshan's, but this movie is so iconic that unconsciously there's no way of getting around it. If you've seen Jodhaa first, you'll notice faint little echoes here, not imitation, just slight things that make you think, 'Of course this is how Akbar would behave in middle age.' Mr. Kapoor is genius! He deftly and sympathetically essays the struggle between being an Emperor and being a man who loves his family. The final scene is just heartbreaking, because while Salim and later even Anarkali see him as an unjust tyrant, their enemy, we see him as someone bound to put the greater good first. Something Salim is incapable of doing, and something Anarkali desperately knows she should do, but her passion for her lover constantly gets in the way. But even with all that, my favorite scenes are between Akbar and his Jodhabai. Okay I'm a sucker for those two, it's an illness of some sort. He's particularly effective in a scene honoring his dear wife's Rajput customs. I was beaming with joy on that one. Their arguments were also very good, and again there were those lovely echoes...Okay, Jodhabai! Played by Durga Khote, she also has some major impact in the film. Not only is she also torn like her husband between humanity and duty, but also torn between her husband and her beloved son. I loved how regal she was and her strength, boy she needed it. She's got these two powerhouse actors, one of the most beautiful women ever born, and a very small role. It takes a true professional, and dedication to the film as a whole, in order to make the right impact without sticking out, and this lady knew her job well. There are two scenes that made my jaw drop, but my absolute favorite is Jodhabai letting her son know that he absolutely cannot have Anarkali and warns him not to make her stand against him. Her mannerisms and voice are different to her modern counterpart but I still thought, 'Of course, that's how Jodhaa would do it twenty-five years later!' And for just a tad more trivia, one of Ms. Khote's grandson's was a producer of Jodhaa Akbar!Don't you just love it when actors give themselves one name? Mr. Ajit plays the young strapping Durjan Singh, Salim's best friend, brother-in-arms, right hand, and if we cared about historical accuracy at all, his cousin by one of his maternal uncles Maan Singh. (He's in the movie too.) Now this man IS the best looking of the bunch, and quite a good actor. I get a kick out of the fact his nickname was ""The Clark Gable of India"" it fits! He got the actual big sword fight in the film, and unfortunately... (well it's just another reason to dislike Salim.)The last must discuss performance in the movie is Ms. Nigar Sultana who plays the scheming Bahar! A lady of the harem higher in rank than Anarkali who wants the Prince, (and more importantly the queen's crown) for herself. She's an icy sort of snake. Beautiful, imperious, ruthless, and charming. You almost love to hate her, but Anarkali's sweetness and pure heart stop you because you don't want to see her hurt. Ms. Sultana played the role with an understated relish. Bahar, is the kind where she'll do just about anything to get what she wants, but it's never personal. She resents Anarkali stands in her way, but Anarkali herself means nothing to her. Even her desire for Salim is completely devoid of any emotion for the man himself. She covets power, and she's smart about it. I like that in what could have been an over-the-top cartoonish character both Mr. Asif and Ms. Sultana made her so balanced. Her best scene, the musical debate. It's such fun to watch her get defeated and it roles right off her. Amazing!All in all, this is a classic of classics in every way. Mr. Asif through incredible odds and an incredible span of ten years painstakingly brought his incredible vision to the screen. And I do recommend getting this 2 disc colorized version. Later I'll probably get the original B&W; version just to compare both experiences. But this even with some flaws is well worth it.Bonus disc- The re-release premiere. Good for star watching you'll see Dilip Kumar, Aishwarya Rai, and Rani Mukerjee, but beware it is LONG and NO subtitles and only one person bothers with English. I got a bit bored. After that, is a bunch of ordinary people giving comments about the movie some saw it for the first time, some were seeing it again after years and for the first time in color. Some were even from other countries, France, Poland, and the USA! Mostly in English. That was more interesting. Then the restoration work, VERY interesting, I just wish they'd had better technology at the time. But still, a job to be praised. All in English. Then Bollywood speaks about Mughal-E-Azam! HRITHIK! LOL He had himself a HUGE crush on the leading lady, (don't blame him) and it's so funny because in 2004 he had NO CLUE he would eventually be playing Akbar! Jackie Schroff, was also very interesting, and I've become a big fan of his. Amitji is the only one who didn't speak English! Why Amitji, WHY! Finally, one deleted song, fully restored, colorized, but alas no subtitles.My humble verdict...
