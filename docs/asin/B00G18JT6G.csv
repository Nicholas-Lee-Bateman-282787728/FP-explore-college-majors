1676078,A2AN5WDTIQSLWU,B00G18JT6G,Blue Leaf,"[2, 2]","I am purposely not calling it a horror series because it is more of a supernatural drama similar in many respects to the U.S. program LOST or even a bit like David Lynch's TWIN PEAKS.  The series was created by Fabrice Gobert and originally shown on Canal+ in France and since has been distributed internationally.  Most recently it has been shown on The Sundance Channel.The story is set in an idyllic, french, lakeside village at the base of the Alps. It is about the &#34;return&#34; of five individuals who had previously lived in the village and each had died under different circumstances. They are still dead but look the same as the day they died.  The focus is primarily on four of these &#34;returnees&#34;.First there is Victor, a young boy who was shot and killed along with his parents and older brother during a burglary.  He attaches himself to a young woman who has been damaged both physically and emotionally by an assault and attempted killing.  He looks upon her as his guardian angel or fairy and he is now looking for the men who killed his family.  He is both a sweet boy and an entity looking for revenge.  His beautifully haunting brown eyes hides his mysterious and painful past.Second, there is Camille, a teenage girl who died when the school bus she was riding went over an embankment.  She is a twin and her sister, now four years older than she, has stolen her first love and Camille's primary mission is to rekindle this love without giving away her true identity.  Her family has been in mourning since her death and are overwhelmed with her reappearance but are scared at the repercussions it may cause.Third, is Simon, a young man who died on his wedding day before he was able to say &#34;I DO&#34;.  It is now ten years later and his fiance has moved on.  She was pregnant when he died and now they have a  ten year old daughter.  She is also about to marry her current boyfriend, the deputy of police in this town.  When her boyfriend realizes that her past fiance has returned he is out to make sure they do not rekindle their past romance.Last is Sergei, a serial killer who preyed upon many young women in the village, attacking them in a tunnel under one of the roads, repeatedly stabbing them in the abdomen and eating their flesh.  Now this happened  before he was one of the 'undead&#34;.  His mother had tried to protect him but his brother had been outraged at the sick behavior of his younger brother.  Now the Sergeir has returned and his brother must deal with this dilemma all over again.Each episode describes the past life of one of &#34;the returned&#34; and how it is effecting them, their immediate family and close friends. At the same time that the characters return from the dead, strange phenomenon begin to happen in the town.There is much leeway for individual interpretation with this series. I thought it was about the eternal question of what happens after death and the way most people ignore that question. We often pretend that our mortality is not worth contemplating until we have to and the fear that occurs when confronted with our mortality is put aside in our thoughts until it is absolutely necessary.  In this series the villagers are forced to literally come face to face with this issue as their loved ones, their friends and their neighbors return from dead and the question of where they have been and why they are back slowly becomes the primary focus of all.The only issue I had with the series is that it was too short, (only eight episodes), and now after a gripping final episode it may be a year or even longer before the audience gets any answers to the questions posed in the finale..",5,French Supernatural Mystery Series,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,3672,"['am', 'purposely', 'not', 'calling', 'horror', 'series', 'more', 'supernatural', 'drama', 'similar', 'many', 'respects', 'U.S.', 'program', 'LOST', 'even', 'bit', 'David', 'Lynch', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'series', 'was', 'created', 'Fabrice', 'Gobert', 'originally', 'shown', 'Canal+', 'France', 'been', 'distributed', 'internationally', 'Most', 'recently', 'been', 'shown', 'Sundance', 'Channel.The', 'story', 'set', 'idyllic', 'french', 'lakeside', 'village', 'base', 'Alps', '34', 'return', '34', 'five', 'individuals', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'lived', 'village', 'had', 'died', 'different', 'circumstances', 'are', 'still', 'dead', 'look', 'same', 'day', 'died', 'focus', 'primarily', 'four', '34', 'returnees', '34', 'Victor', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'killed', 'parents', 'older', 'brother', 'burglary', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'damaged', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'assault', 'attempted', 'killing', 'upon', 'guardian', 'angel', 'fairy', 'now', 'looking', 'men', 'who', 'killed', 'family', 'sweet', 'boy', 'entity', 'looking', 'revenge', 'beautifully', 'haunting', 'brown', 'eyes', 'mysterious', 'painful', 'past.Second', 'Camille', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'died', 'when', 'school', 'bus', 'was', 'riding', 'went', 'embankment', 'twin', 'sister', 'now', 'four', 'years', 'older', 'stolen', 'first', 'love', 'Camille', 'primary', 'mission', 'rekindle', 'love', 'giving', 'away', 'true', 'identity', 'family', 'been', 'mourning', 'death', 'are', 'overwhelmed', 'reappearance', 'are', 'scared', 'repercussions', 'may', 'cause.Third', 'Simon', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'died', 'wedding', 'day', 'was', 'able', 'say', '34', 'DO', '34', 'now', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'fiance', 'moved', 'was', 'pregnant', 'when', 'died', 'now', 'have', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'also', 'about', 'marry', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'deputy', 'police', 'town', 'When', 'boyfriend', 'past', 'fiance', 'returned', 'out', 'make', 'sure', 'do', 'not', 'rekindle', 'past', 'romance.Last', 'Sergei', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'preyed', 'many', 'young', 'women', 'village', 'attacking', 'tunnel', 'one', 'roads', 'repeatedly', 'stabbing', 'abdomen', 'eating', 'flesh', 'Now', 'happened', 'was', 'one', ""'undead"", '34', 'mother', 'had', 'tried', 'protect', 'brother', 'had', 'been', 'outraged', 'sick', 'behavior', 'younger', 'brother', 'Now', 'Sergeir', 'returned', 'brother', 'must', 'deal', 'dilemma', 'again.Each', 'episode', 'past', 'life', 'one', '34', 'returned', '34', 'how', 'effecting', 'immediate', 'family', 'close', 'friends', 'same', 'time', 'characters', 'return', 'dead', 'strange', 'phenomenon', 'begin', 'happen', 'much', 'leeway', 'individual', 'interpretation', 'series', 'thought', 'was', 'eternal', 'question', 'what', 'death', 'way', 'most', 'people', 'ignore', 'question', 'often', 'pretend', 'mortality', 'not', 'worth', 'contemplating', 'have', 'fear', 'when', 'confronted', 'mortality', 'put', 'aside', 'thoughts', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'series', 'villagers', 'are', 'forced', 'literally', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'issue', 'loved', 'ones', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'return', 'dead', 'question', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'why', 'are', 'back', 'slowly', 'primary', 'focus', 'all.The', 'only', 'issue', 'had', 'series', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'only', 'eight', 'episodes', 'now', 'gripping', 'final', 'episode', 'may', 'be', 'year', 'even', 'longer', 'audience', 'answers', 'questions', 'posed', 'finale..']",N/A

I may edit this as it progresses, if I can bare the show much longer.  The positive's... Great tension, suspense, and it's eerie and atmospheric, the acting is also fantastic.  The story... Small town France and all of the sudden roughly 3 years later dead loved ones start returning to the town to families, lovers,  and to complete strangers.  When they return they show no signs of age and more incredibally there isn't a SINGLE sign that distress has taken place physically, much less that they died, violently. Nor are they aware of their apparent death at all.  This isn't the only glaring plot hole, and I do mean glaring.  This is supposed to be a psychological conundrum of sorts, attempting to have you sympathize with the characters and their reaction to the returned.  Why do I say that, because each time a reveal of dead human to alive human happens, after the initial shock of the situation of course, the alive humans treats the situation as if nothing is wrong.  They so desperately want to have them back that they dare not mention the phenomena.  However as you can imagine in a small town where dead people are walking around stalking ex lovers and drinking at the only bar in town.  It manages to stay an absolute open secret, like no biggie.  Personally it's more unbelievable to me than the dead returning, how they mange to fly under the radar with so many people knowing about them.  Not only that but they have antagonists as well and still the reactions are inexplicable to me.  There is only one person who had a reasonable reaction in my mind up to this point maybe two.This is an entertaining show and I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and the tie-ins that must be around the corner.  I'm also ready for the mounting tension to break, the alive and the dead to snap and people to start dying.  The show does have me gripped in mystery and anticipation and I like that and I recommend the show especially if you're not a stickler for detail.  If you are you will have bouts of frustration with the show but as you can see from the other reviews not many people are too distracted by these issues.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 2]","One of my favorite lines from the TV show &#34;Pushing Daisies&#34; is when Ned the Pie-Maker criticizes the term &#34;living dead&#34;: &#34;When you're dead, that's what you are. But when you're dead and then you're not, you're alive again. Can't we say 'alive again'?&#34;He might as well have been talking about &#34;The Returned&#34; (aka &#34;Les Revenants&#34;), a French TV show that explores what happens when the dead return to life in a small French village -- and what it might lead to. Twilit, murky, gory and always filled with a sense of unease, this is an exquisitely haunting piece with plenty of twists and unanswered questions.Five people mysteriously appear in a small mountain town in France, with no memory of their deaths or anything after that. Simon (Pierre Perrier) and fifteen-year-old Camille (Yara Pilartz) finds that in the years since their deaths, their families have moved on -- hers has fallen apart, including her troubled twin Lena (Jenna Thiam), and his fiancee Adele (Clotilde Hesme) is about to marry another man.But family drama is not the biggest problem: one of the &#34;Returned&#34; is a serial killer with a penchant for repeatedly stabbing women to death, then eating their internal organs. And the killer's last victim, Julie (C&eacute;line Sallette) finds herself caring for a strange little boy with mysterious powers.Power fluctuations and small floods begin to plague the town, as the &#34;Returned&#34; try to fit back into their old lives -- or in Camille's case, try to make a new one for herself. But more problems keep cropping up -- Lena suffers from a mysterious gangrenous gash on her back, and Adele's jealous fiance Thomas (Samir Guesmi) tries to frame Simon for the murders. But as the enigmatic Pierre (Jean-Franois Sivadier) gathers them together, it becomes clear that the dead are not returning by accident... and the five &#34;Returned&#34; are not alone.&#34;The Returned&#34; is not a show to watch casually -- it's a complicated tapestry of many plot threads, woven and twisted until you can barely see where they end. Seemingly ordinary stuff turns out to be incredibly weird and twisted, and seemingly cliched characters turn out to be... well, something very unexpected.The story unfolds slowly, moodily building to its odd climax with every episode. The story is also pretty well-balanced between the screwed-up personal lives of the Returned, and the mysterious supernatural goings-on (mostly from Victor). The supernatural is kept pretty low-key most of the time, but it's clear that something bizarre and otherworldly is in town. And it's graced with some striking if disturbing imagery -- consider the drowned animals floating over a city submerged in a clear green-blue lake.It's never made entirely clear if the Returned are undead or truly &#34;alive again.&#34; But unlike your stereotypical zombies, they seem to be fully cognizant. The actors almost all do amazing jobs here, from the troubled teenagers to the psychic prostitute, the jealous cop to the serial killer -- and all of them are painted in shades of grey, each with their own motives and flaws. The only exception is Swann Nambotin, who is just kind of... blank.Honestly, the biggest problem with this series is that it ends on the ultimate cliffhanger -- we have no answers about the Returned, what caused their reappearance and what happened. Season Two is a long, long way aways!You would expect nothing but joy if the dead returned to life, but &#34;The Returned&#34; shows that sometimes that is only the start of the trouble.

1676089,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00G18JT6G,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 1]","Before I go any further, let me give you this one clarification: I was one of the fans immeasurably disappointed with ABC TV&#8217;s LOST.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong: I loved that show!  It&#8217;s just that I, like so many others I&#8217;ve met online, were more than a bit frustrated that the showrunners left so many questions unanswered in the final estimation.  Yes, I get all of the gobbledygook about how &#8220;it was always meant to be about the characters&#8221; and not the mysteries, but it was the mysteries that fueled so much speculation.  At the end of the day, I didn&#8217;t honestly give two shakes about Kate&#8217;s family beyond the Island; what mattered to me was how all of these people overlapped in their lives prior to winding up stranded and maybe even why they did.I bring this up only because in reviewing some of what&#8217;s been written online about THE RETURNED many folks have drawn comparisons to LOST.  True, these characters also get further definition by way of flashbacks.  True, these characters seem to be linked in ways far more surprising than your average, run-of-the-mill neighbor or casual acquaintance.  But as far as I can tell the comparisons generally stop there.  Because THE RETURNED has already crossed that line that LOST&#8217;s showrunners refuted for so long &#8211; that death and the afterlife is central to the stories being told &#8211; I&#8217;m willing to keep my disbelief suspended so long as the storytelling remains so richly interesting.More after the break &#8230;(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final, unblemished assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)In a quiet French town nestled between several mountaintops, those who have died some time ago have suddenly returned to their families.  They haven&#8217;t changed.  They haven&#8217;t even aged.  They&#8217;ve returned looking very much like they did so long ago.  However, they&#8217;re still not quite themselves, and the threat they bring with them very well might unravel reality as we know it before all is said and done.Yes, THE RETURNED resembles LOST in that it presents and develops a quality stable of interesting characters; but one of the chief differences between them is that &#8211; to a very high degree &#8211; we know what we need to know about them not long after they&#8217;re introduced into this mythology.  See, what would appear to matter most is that these characters have died.  In many cases, we&#8217;re given the particulars of their deaths, many of them relatively grisly (these are not your average demises, and many of them relate to moments of extreme emotion being attached to said endings).  However, upon their return, these resurrected people essentially begin a quest to make things right so far as their perspective allows them.While their various friends and family members have moved on &#8211; they&#8217;ve all basically been through the various stages of grief and to a large degree have found some peace in present day &#8211; the Returned have not.  The precious who, what, where, when or why they&#8217;ve come back may be modestly shrouded in mystery, but the audience is still given some sort of motivation that leads one to conclude that the journey they&#8217;re on relates somehow to &#8216;resolution&#8217; for whatever troubled them while they were alive.  It isn&#8217;t like they&#8217;re &#8216;getting even&#8217;; rather, they&#8217;re trying to put right what they see went wrong with their various deaths.That said, this first season of THE RETURNED is probably not going to go down with everyone who stumbles across it like I did (I didn&#8217;t watch it while it aired on IFC but instead discovered it via binge-watching the DVD set).  The pacing is quite slow &#8211; more so in the early episodes as there appears to be a good amount of backstory the showrunners wanted to establish &#8211; and, as the mysteries get introduced one by one, they&#8217;re really not given much ado.  For example, there is some possible tie-in to animal carcasses (of which several turn up through-out the season), but it&#8217;s never quite sufficiently addressed; instead, a carcass shows up, a question is raised, and then the plot moves forward.  Those who are sticklers for detail (such as those who want to know where the body came from) are likely going to be perplexed very early on.However, what THE RETURNED does exceedingly well is craft an overwhelming sense of dread throughout so much of these proceedings.  Families once torn apart are suddenly forced back together, and none of this happens without additional heartache, heartbreak, or other dire consequence.  Lives are ripped apart once more, and before they can even begin to adequately deal with their emotions the entire town finds itself imperiled by an even greater threat (which I refuse to spoil for you).Thankfully, THE RETURNED is the kind of show that lends itself to speculation both wild and mundane.  As I don&#8217;t think a review is the place to really expose theories about what&#8217;s going on, I will mention one word that kept coming up when I and my lovely wife talked about it after finished the season: resurrection.  There&#8217;s something to the circularity of life &#8211; as well as the circularity of these people interwoven existences &#8211; that gets ample exploration here.  What that&#8217;ll all mean once the program&#8217;s secrets are revealed I honestly couldn&#8217;t say.  But I&#8217;d like to think that the eventual destination will be worth the wild ride they took us on.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Yes, it&#8217;s always possible that when THE RETURNED returns it may suffer the fate of ABC TV&#8217;s LOST, meaning not all of the questions it raised will get sufficiently addressed by the time all is said and done.  But &#8211; unlike LOST &#8211; it wouldn&#8217;t appear as if this program could go on for four, five, or six seasons.  I wouldn&#8217;t want to say more out of fear of spoiling it, but &#8211; so far as this critic is concerned &#8211; THE RETURNED is time well spent ruminating on death and resurrection.",5,The

Set in a quiet, northern France town, various people who have died over the years begin to come back to life and head back to the town. This wrecks all sorts of havoc on those those their family and friends.To begin with, this is a great idea, and I like the way they play it. They don't go, openly, for the spook factor. They don't need to. The idea is creepy all by itself. Here they play it for the strong human element surrounding the reappearance of these people. Face it. What would you do if someone you knew who died, suddenly walked back into your life? There is nothing in our makeup that prepares us for such a thing. But this is just part of it. All these returnees are part of other stories. Each has their own story on their death, and other weird stuff is happening. Why does the town's power randomly go out. Why is water in the lake by the dam receding? The writer/producer doles out little tidbits here and there as the story begins to come together.All the writing, directing and acting are at a professional level. The music, by Mogwai, also helps dial up the creep factor. I also get the feeling this won't be a slap-dash ending.

1676102,A35I428M5WAT5Q,B00G18JT6G,"Joseph Kohout Jr. ""The Art of War""","[17, 22]","NO SPOILERS:The Returned (French: Les Revenants) is a television drama series created by Fabrice Gobert and shown on Canal+ in France, BeTV in Belgium and SVT in Sweden. Eight episodes were shown from 26 November to 17 December 2012. It is an adaptation of the 2004 film They Came Back (in French titled Les Revenants). Season 2 is to air in 2014.Credit to Wiki for the synopsis:&#34;In a small mountain town, many dead people reappear, apparently alive and normal: road accident victim teenager Camille; suicidal bridegroom Simon; &#34;Victor&#34;, a small boy who was murdered by burglars; and Serge, a serial killer. They try to resume their lives as strange phenomena occur: amongst recurring power outages, the water level of the reservoir mysteriously lowers, revealing the presence of dead animals and a church steeple, and strange marks appear on the bodies of the living and the dead.&#34;Let's get the obvious out of the way. Yes, the audio is in French and there are subtitles. Yes, the French are generally not known for producing TV with international appeal (the excellent series &#34;Spiral&#34; being the exception). First point: As an evolving connoisseur (like my use of French here) of international TV, I have come to actually appreciate subtitles. Why, you ask? I have found that watching a program (TV or movie) with subtitles requires a greater level of concentration (hence commitment). I can't be checking my email or playing marbles on my laptop when I have to read the subtitles. As an added benefit, I found my long forgotten high school coming back to me, as I began to understand more of the spoken words and even some of the inflection. Second Point: It would be a huge mistake to discount Les Revenants due to the so-so reputation of French TV in general.I was hooked after the first episode by virtue of a plot twist that I didn't see coming. I am also interested in how people live and the imagery and bleakness of the French alpine town provides the perfect backdrop to the plot. While it is not a perfect analogy and I am not even certain that it is a proper catch phrase, Les Revenants has a &#34;Twin-Peakish&#34; feel to it.Give Les Revenants a chance and don't be scared off by the subtitles. Kudos again to Sundance for taking the chance. With &#34;Top of the Lake&#34; and Les Revenants, I can only hope that Sundance continues to introduce the USA to interesting international programming.",4,Bravo Sundance!

The eerie theme of the dead who return to a small, unnamed French town, is simple and yet profound. We get to see and know weird zombie twin connections, a returned serial rapist/killer, and a creepy kid named &#34;Victor.&#34; And among the living is that fundamentalist Helping Hand outreach -- that's got enough food to outlast impending disaster and is armed to the teeth. And what *is* it with those dead animals floating in flood water??? How is the priest involved, what does he suspect -- or know? And then, there's the fact that *nobody* seems to be able to *leave* this town. What IS this series really about?Is the nameless town really Purgatory, and all the people in it have been &#34;floating&#34; there since the first dam burst back in the 1970s? (This would fit nicely with it's Catholic flavor.) The Returned are the strangest zombies I've ever seen -- sure they decompose a little, but they also are able to reproduce sexually with the *living.* Weird. The Returned asks us to set aside our perceptions about death and life. It certainly made me think how I would react if my own dead came back. (I'd welcome them, I think, as long as they didn't eat brains or Service Dogs.)The one thing for certain in the world of The Returned is that love *endures* -- especially motherly love.

She was one of the girls who perished in that tragic accident. She arrives home, goes to the refrigerator and starts eating. Her shocked mother comes into the kitchen and can't speak. Camille, the young girl apologizes for being late and says she is so hungry. She goes onto say that she doesn't know what happened, but she awoke from a nap on the side of the road. The family is confused, and in other parts of the town strange happenings are occurring. More people are showing up, the water level in the dam is dropping, the lights are going on and off.

But when I watched The Returned, or as the French say it, Les Revenants, that's exactly what happened.Yes, you have to read subtitles, unless you got an A in high school French, you won't understand a word. Nevertheless, that didn't bother me, because boy this series is nifty.You know me.  Usually I like British TV, but I must say this story is great.  Since Resurrection started on ABC this season with people coming back from the dead, I had read that some wondered if it was a spinoff from this series.  However, I think it's similar, but not based on the same underlying premise.Let me further state that I am NOT a fan of zombies.  In fact, I have never read a zombie book or seen a zombie movie or watched The Walking Dead. Shocking, I know.  So I am definitely not zombie influenced. (It makes you wonder what the fascination is with all these shows about dead people. No more friendly ghosts. They've returned in the flesh.)I think what drew me into the story, is how it plays out bit by bit like a puzzle of people.  Those who have returned, of course, certainly have a past.  Some don't know why - others do.  Somehow in this small mountainous town in France, they are all connected.  The location has a tragic history, too, but if I told you the tragedy it would be a spoiler, so I'm not going to do that.Needless to say it's worth tuning in.  The end of the first season of eight episodes has left me hanging by a thread.  What's going to happen next?  Do I have to wait until Season 2?  Will the humans live?  Will the dead people reign?  You left me hanging at the last episode!!  The show sort of reminds me of Lost.  You really do get lost in it, because you're trying to understand what the hell is going on. So you keep tuning in hoping to find the answer.Looking for a good creepy show?  Tune in to The Returned and sharpen your French.Oui tr&egrave;s bon!There is some violence (serial killer).

I have to say that the, ah, Sherrif (?) is pretty low, sacrificing other people's loved ones in order to get his child back, but when they want HIS wife he suddenly is willing to defend against them.I AM glad that the twin sisters reconciled-but imagine the trauma of your loved one coming back, and then being taken from you by the 'undead'.....Fascinating show, I hate that we have to WAIT so long for season 2!",5,Great Show,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,1448,"['love', 'show', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'sad', 'creepy', 'intriging', 'more', 'long', 'movie', 'television', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'music', 'mood', 'go', 'along', 'there', 'increasing', 'sense', 'dread', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'SpoilersHaving', 'just', 'watched', 'episode', '8', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'entire', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'happened', 'only', 'one', 'week', 'flood', 'years', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'dam', 'broke', 'so', 'many', 'were', 'killed', 'speculate', 'ALL', 'people', 'town', 'are', 'actually', 'dead-it', 'just', ""'living"", 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'it.Regardless', 'town', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'flooded', 'end', 'episode', '8', 'certainly', 'reenactment', 'kind', 'Did', 'authorities', 'KNOW', 'original', 'flood', 'was', 'coming', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'warn', 'anyone', 'Creepy', 'Victor', 'still', 'somehow', 'child', 'needing', 'protection', 'care', ""n't"", ""'mean"", 'hurt', 'anyone', 'am', 'so', 'CURIOUS', 'learn', 'why', 'happening.And', 'why', 'do', ""'dead"", 'want', 'own', 'have', 'say', 'ah', 'Sherrif', 'pretty', 'low', 'sacrificing', 'other', 'people', 'loved', 'ones', 'order', 'get', 'child', 'back', 'when', 'want', 'HIS', 'wife', 'suddenly', 'willing', 'defend', 'them.I', 'AM', 'twin', 'sisters', 'reconciled-but', 'imagine', 'trauma', 'loved', 'one', 'coming', 'back', 'then', 'being', 'taken', ""'undead"", '..Fascinating', 'show', 'hate', 'have', 'WAIT', 'so', 'long', 'season', '2']",N/A
