Empire of the Air is a fascinating study of broadcasting pioneers who are laregly forgotten now.  The Shaker film is quaint.  Brooklyn Bridge is vintage Ken Burns and the Statue of Liberty film is ok.  Thomas Hart Benton's biography is interesting, but not really to my taste.  The Congress film is intersting to a point, but tries to cover too broad a subject---too many years, too many personalities---to really do any of them justice.
