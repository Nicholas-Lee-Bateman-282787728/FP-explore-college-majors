I'm so glad I ordered it to watch on DVD without all the sappy commercials and so that I could view the show in order. The episodes do stand alone but the story among the main characters is the best part and worth waiting to see when it comes out on DVD instead of upending your life to catch it on TV every week.

1058284,A2W6SI073FIRMA,B000NOIVU4,KlownArt,"[3, 3]","House M.D. - Seasons 1 & 2House is the perfect show for everyone. Yes, I said it. Everyone. There is drama, gore, intensity, comedy, and romance. If you are not a fan of those, then you hate everything. If you are looking to get into House, I suggest picking up this set. If you do not even know what House is, then this is the review for you.In my recent review of House M.D. - Season 2, I described the stories main drift as this:""House is a painkiller-addicted doctor who walks with a limp due to a muscle being removed in his leg. He is the best doctor in the hospital, but is often apathetic and hates patients. The storyline of a common episode will depict House and his team trying to find out what is wrong with an abnormal patient. They will come up with a solution and find out it is wrong. Then they continue to find solutions until they find the right one. Along the way, there is plenty of gore and snide remarks on behalf of House. Almost every episode has this underlying pattern.""House is developed in Season 1. Everything I described in the last quote is showed in Season 1. House's sense of humor will have you laughing, but will never ruin the moment. His attitude about his job makes him interesting. While he does not care about his patients, you find him eventually caring about things. It makes it seem like his heart is not as cold as originally thought. This makes him a dynamic character.House has a team of doctors that help him solve these cases. Carmen, the over-caring woman. Foreman, the dynamic black man. Chase, the odd Aussie. Each one of them has a fair share of character build-up during Season 2. Foreman changes multiple times progressively making you care more about him.Season 1 introduces you to House and develops his character. Season 2 develops his team's character. I prefer Season 2 for all the dynamic characters that are created. I gave both five stars though and they are both fantastic. The Season finales for both are fantastic. There are a few extras on each season that you might find interesting. The show itself is worth five stars alone without it. You will find this show to be completely captivating, and you will be craving more.",5,Two Seasons of the best show of all time,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,2188,"['House', 'M.D', 'Seasons', '1', '2House', 'perfect', 'show', 'everyone', 'Yes', 'said', 'Everyone', 'drama', 'gore', 'intensity', 'comedy', 'romance', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'then', 'hate', 'everything', 'are', 'looking', 'get', 'House', 'suggest', 'picking', 'up', 'set', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'House', 'then', 'review', 'you.In', 'recent', 'review', 'House', 'M.D', 'Season', '2', 'described', 'stories', 'main', 'drift', 'House', 'painkiller-addicted', 'doctor', 'who', 'limp', 'due', 'muscle', 'being', 'removed', 'leg', 'best', 'doctor', 'hospital', 'often', 'apathetic', 'patients', 'storyline', 'common', 'episode', 'will', 'depict', 'House', 'team', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'wrong', 'abnormal', 'patient', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'solution', 'find', 'wrong', 'Then', 'continue', 'find', 'solutions', 'find', 'right', 'one', 'way', 'plenty', 'gore', 'snide', 'remarks', 'behalf', 'House', 'episode', 'underlying', 'pattern', 'House', 'developed', 'Season', '1', 'Everything', 'described', 'last', 'quote', 'showed', 'Season', '1', 'House', 'sense', 'humor', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'will', 'never', 'ruin', 'moment', 'attitude', 'job', 'interesting', 'not', 'care', 'patients', 'find', 'eventually', 'caring', 'things', 'seem', 'heart', 'not', 'as', 'cold', 'originally', 'thought', 'dynamic', 'character.House', 'team', 'doctors', 'help', 'solve', 'cases', 'Carmen', 'over-caring', 'woman', 'Foreman', 'dynamic', 'black', 'man', 'Chase', 'odd', 'Aussie', 'one', 'fair', 'share', 'character', 'build-up', 'Season', '2', 'Foreman', 'multiple', 'times', 'progressively', 'making', 'care', 'more', 'him.Season', '1', 'introduces', 'House', 'character', 'Season', '2', 'team', 'character', 'prefer', 'Season', '2', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'are', 'created', 'gave', 'five', 'stars', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Season', 'finales', 'are', 'fantastic', 'are', 'few', 'extras', 'season', 'might', 'find', 'interesting', 'show', 'worth', 'five', 'stars', 'alone', 'will', 'find', 'show', 'be', 'completely', 'captivating', 'will', 'be', 'craving', 'more']",House: Season One / House: Season Two Value Pack

1058287,A1A8NFZBNE6MDI,B000NOIVU4,snwlprd,"[0, 0]","If you like the TV show House, this set is a must have.  It holds the key history of the characters--House/Cuddy; House/Stacy (his only love); House/authority (always the enemy for him!); House/original assitants.  I had never seen the show, but it was recommended to me since I like sarcastic humor.  Bought this set to get a flavor of it (price too close to cost of season 1 alone not to buy set), and enjoyed so much House's approach that got the rest of the series on DVD.  House is a genius at diagnosing illness, but uses trial and error to narrow it down--tries treatments before testing in interest of time--doesn't value human relationships on the surface, but you can see that it is there for a select few.  He also opposes authority on principal--what is expediant and makes sense controls--and lives by the philosophy that everyone lies...including him!  ""Enjoyable"" humor when he confronts an ill patient, patient family member, etc who he thinks is lying. Very cleaver show--though last season (5) disappointing as seems to have lost focus on diagnosis and spending more time on ""human relations.""  The show's draw is its focus on the process of diagnosis and how humanity is interwoven in that, now (season 5 and 6) the writers have flipped that.  Less interesting, so makes this season 1 and 2 set more enjoyable to savor what was.",5,Where it all began . . .,1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,1347,"['like', 'TV', 'show', 'House', 'set', 'must', 'have', 'key', 'history', 'characters', 'House/Cuddy', 'House/Stacy', 'only', 'love', 'House/authority', 'always', 'enemy', 'House/original', 'assitants', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'was', 'recommended', 'like', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'Bought', 'set', 'get', 'flavor', 'price', 'too', 'close', 'cost', 'season', '1', 'alone', 'not', 'buy', 'set', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'House', 'approach', 'got', 'rest', 'series', 'DVD', 'House', 'genius', 'diagnosing', 'illness', 'trial', 'error', 'narrow', 'down', 'tries', 'treatments', 'testing', 'interest', 'time', ""n't"", 'value', 'human', 'relationships', 'surface', 'can', 'see', 'there', 'select', 'few', 'also', 'authority', 'principal', 'what', 'expediant', 'sense', 'controls', 'lives', 'philosophy', 'everyone', 'lies', 'including', 'Enjoyable', 'humor', 'when', 'ill', 'patient', 'patient', 'family', 'member', 'etc', 'who', 'lying', 'Very', 'cleaver', 'show', 'last', 'season', '5', 'disappointing', 'have', 'lost', 'focus', 'diagnosis', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'human', 'relations', 'show', 'draw', 'focus', 'process', 'diagnosis', 'how', 'humanity', 'interwoven', 'now', 'season', '5', '6', 'writers', 'have', 'flipped', 'Less', 'interesting', 'so', 'season', '1', '2', 'set', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'savor', 'what', 'was']",House: Season One / House: Season Two Value Pack
