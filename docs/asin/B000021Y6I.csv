Mason's wise-cracking daughter,(played by Quinn  Cummings) is fantastic as a cynical 10 year old and almost steals the movie  away from the main 2 characters.

Immediately Dreyfuss begins to assert his egocentric personality by laying  down the rules of the house &quot;I DON'T like the panties drying on the  rod !! &quot;  and their relationship goes down hill from there.  But  naturally, as it always goes in this type of romantic comedy, the 2 main  characters eventually begin to warm up to each other and have a  relationship of their own.  It's a movie about taking chances and allowing  yourself to be vulnerable just ONE more time to let love into your heart.  My friend, Debbie, and I have watched this movie so many times we can  practically recite the dialogue by heart &quot;mama bear done fixed the  cave up good !&quot;  This movie is worth watching if just to see Dreyfuss'  character play the worst version of Richard III imaginable.

512939,A51IK68MWKV5R,B000021Y6I,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[2, 9]","Ever since I learned that Richard Dreyfuss had won the Best Actor Academy Award for his role as Elliot Garfield in The Goodbye Girl, it had been added to my ""must-see"" list. I just saw it last night and, like many Neil Simon films, it has its ups and downs.When her live-in actor boyfriend Tony leaves for Italy, out-of-work dancer Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason, who was married to Simon and would eventually act in six of his films) is left alone, again, with her 10-year-old daughter Lucy (Quinn Cummings). What she didn't know is that, before leaving and since the lease was in his name, Tony had sublet their apartment to someone else: struggling Chicago actor Elliot Garfield, just in town for his New York premiere as Richard III. After a lengthy set of arguments, they come to an arrangement: they will share the apartment.The Goodbye Girl is a romantic comedy so, of course, Paula and Elliot spend the first half of the movie at each other's throat (before coming together at the end) while Lucy delivers the film's best lines and is, in general, adorably charming. Cummings probably gives the film's most engaging performance. Mason is good, but her sharp features left me wondering what the attraction was, although the bearded and bespectacled Dreyfuss is no catch, either. (It is apparent that the cast was chosen for their acting ability and not their matinee idol looks.)And now Dreyfuss: did he deserve the Oscar over Woody Allen (Annie Hall), Richard Burton (Equus), Marcello Mastroianni (A Special Day), and John Travolta (Saturday Night Fever)? I'm torn but tend to lean toward the positive, not based on his entire performance, but on specific moments when I went ""wow"" like when Paula and Lucy go to see him after the opening of Richard III. Every bit of that scene comes through his eyes and facial expression. He doesn't say a word and, probably because of that, my eyes were riveted to him. For the rest, just imagine Hooper from Jaws in love; Dreyfuss usually plays himself. Although I can certainly imagine that Jason Alexander's performance as George on Seinfeld owes more than a little to Dreyfuss' 1970s film persona, especially here.Neil Simon stories are generally uneven and The Goodbye Girl is no exception. When he is writing comedy, there is no one better. Unfortunately, he likes to insert moments of drama in his plays, as well, and, after laughing so much, the absence of it is very noticeable. I found myself slowly losing interest toward the end as the romance developed. I'm not intrigued by watching two very ordinary-looking people kissing, and there is at least one intense scene of that alone. Also, Lucy became less prominent as the romance was played out, and that is a loss. And the last quarter of simply didn't have room to be funny. Surprisingly enough, even though The Goodbye Girl is one of the few Simon movies not based on a Broadway play, it feels like one: it takes place almost entirely in one location, and the actors (particularly Dreyfuss) often descend to extreme gestures. I can't imagine watching it again, but I think people should see it, especially actors, if just to watch Dreyfuss play Richard III as a mincing gay man. It's offensive in the best way.",4,Dreyfuss as Richard III?,1088121600,"06 25, 2004",2004,3218,"['Ever', 'learned', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'had', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'Elliot', 'Garfield', 'Goodbye', 'Girl', 'had', 'been', 'added', 'must-see', 'list', 'just', 'saw', 'last', 'night', 'many', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'films', 'ups', 'downs.When', 'live-in', 'actor', 'boyfriend', 'Tony', 'Italy', 'out-of-work', 'dancer', 'Paula', 'McFadden', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'Simon', 'would', 'eventually', 'act', 'six', 'films', 'left', 'alone', 'again', '10-year-old', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'Quinn', 'Cummings', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'leaving', 'lease', 'was', 'name', 'Tony', 'had', 'sublet', 'apartment', 'someone', 'else', 'struggling', 'Chicago', 'actor', 'Elliot', 'Garfield', 'just', 'town', 'New', 'York', 'premiere', 'Richard', 'III', 'lengthy', 'set', 'arguments', 'come', 'arrangement', 'will', 'share', 'apartment.The', 'Goodbye', 'Girl', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'so', 'course', 'Paula', 'Elliot', 'spend', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'other', 'throat', 'coming', 'together', 'end', 'Lucy', 'film', 'best', 'lines', 'general', 'adorably', 'charming', 'Cummings', 'probably', 'film', 'most', 'engaging', 'performance', 'Mason', 'good', 'sharp', 'features', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'attraction', 'was', 'bearded', 'bespectacled', 'Dreyfuss', 'catch', 'either', 'apparent', 'cast', 'was', 'chosen', 'acting', 'ability', 'not', 'matinee', 'idol', 'now', 'Dreyfuss', 'did', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Equus', 'Marcello', 'Mastroianni', 'Special', 'Day', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', ""'m"", 'torn', 'tend', 'lean', 'positive', 'not', 'based', 'entire', 'performance', 'specific', 'moments', 'when', 'went', 'wow', 'when', 'Paula', 'Lucy', 'go', 'see', 'opening', 'Richard', 'III', 'Every', 'bit', 'scene', 'eyes', 'facial', 'expression', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'probably', 'eyes', 'were', 'riveted', 'rest', 'just', 'imagine', 'Hooper', 'Jaws', 'love', 'Dreyfuss', 'usually', 'can', 'certainly', 'imagine', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'performance', 'George', 'Seinfeld', 'more', 'little', 'Dreyfuss', '1970s', 'film', 'persona', 'especially', 'here.Neil', 'Simon', 'stories', 'are', 'generally', 'uneven', 'Goodbye', 'Girl', 'exception', 'When', 'writing', 'comedy', 'one', 'better', 'Unfortunately', 'insert', 'moments', 'drama', 'plays', 'as', 'well', 'laughing', 'so', 'much', 'absence', 'very', 'noticeable', 'found', 'slowly', 'losing', 'interest', 'end', 'romance', 'developed', ""'m"", 'not', 'intrigued', 'watching', 'two', 'very', 'ordinary-looking', 'people', 'kissing', 'least', 'one', 'intense', 'scene', 'alone', 'Also', 'Lucy', 'became', 'less', 'prominent', 'romance', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'loss', 'last', 'quarter', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'room', 'be', 'funny', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'even', 'Goodbye', 'Girl', 'one', 'few', 'Simon', 'movies', 'not', 'based', 'Broadway', 'play', 'one', 'place', 'almost', 'entirely', 'one', 'location', 'actors', 'particularly', 'Dreyfuss', 'often', 'descend', 'extreme', 'gestures', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'watching', 'again', 'think', 'people', 'should', 'see', 'especially', 'actors', 'just', 'watch', 'Dreyfuss', 'play', 'Richard', 'III', 'mincing', 'gay', 'man', 'offensive', 'best', 'way']",N/A

The film takes the formula of THE ODD COUPLE (another wonderful film that examines the relationship between a pair of opposites trying to compromise in a living situation) with a twist.

However, he also subletted the apartment to his out-of-work actor friend, Elliot Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss).  This wasn't what Paula had in mind.  This wasn't what Elliot had in mind.  Nevertheless, the eccentric Elliot--who chants and eats odd, diet specific food-- and the embittered Paula, who has vowed to stay away from actors--must agree to tolerate each other (to put it nicely).

This film won numerous awards:  Best Actor Oscar/Best Actor Golden Globe/Best Actor BAFTA for Richard Dreyfus; Best Picture Golden Globe; Best Actress Golden Globe/Best Actress Oscar Nomination for Marsha Mason; Best Supporting Actress Oscar Nomination for Quinn Cummings; Best Writing Oscar Nomination for Neil Simon, and the list goes on...Neil Simon's play is dialogue driven rather than action-driven; this sometimes means the kiss of death for film, but in this production, it works beautifully.  Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason (married to Neil Simon at the time) make a lively, comfortably uncomfortable duo as the new-to-New-York actor Elliot Garfield and the down-on-her-luck 'Goodbye Girl' Paula McFadden.  Garfield shows up the night McFadden was dumped by her actor-boyfriend (not the first time this has happened, we soon discover); Garfield has been given the lease to the apartment that McFadden occupies with her daughter Lucy (admirably played by Quinn Cummings) -- much of the 'action' of the film takes place within the confines of this apartment (the primary set for the stage play) -- the relationship as Garfield and McFadden negotiate an unsettled truce which eventually becomes a friendship and then finally a love affair, with Lucy providing colour commentary all along the way.Garfield is booked to play Richard III in the worst of all possible interpretations of the play; it closes in short order with atrocious reviews.  McFadden tries to resurrect her dancing career, realising that she has passed the realistic age for most Broadway productions (certainly at that time).  When Garfield gets the offer of a lifetime, he too plans to leave town, setting McFadden up for failure with a relationship once again, but at least she still has the apartment, right?The dialogue is comedic and realistic at the same time -- the rapid-fire banter is classic Simon stage or screen; the impossible situations that cause characters to be constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown until small miracles creep in to keep life sane are also far more true to life than most people feel comfortable admitting.  Herbert Ross is to be commended with his direction here, in that he made the film a great film while retaining the crucial aspects of the great play.Everyone should see this film, a romantic comedy/drama with a serious edge and ironic undertow.",5,Love means never having to say goodbye...,1074384000,"01 18, 2004",2004,2666,"['current', 'remake', 'Neil', 'Simon', ""'The"", 'Goodbye', 'Girl', 'showing', 'television', 'moment', 'reminded', 'original', 'film', 'production', 'one', 'better', 'films', '1970s', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'derive', 'Broadway', 'play', 'keep', 'much', 'same', 'character', 'play', 'film', 'won', 'numerous', 'awards', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar/Best', 'Actor', 'Golden', 'Globe/Best', 'Actor', 'BAFTA', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Golden', 'Globe/Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'Nomination', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'Nomination', 'Quinn', 'Cummings', 'Best', 'Writing', 'Oscar', 'Nomination', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'list', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'play', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'rather', 'action-driven', 'kiss', 'death', 'film', 'production', 'beautifully', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'married', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'time', 'make', 'lively', 'comfortably', 'uncomfortable', 'duo', 'new-to-New-York', 'actor', 'Elliot', 'Garfield', 'down-on-her-luck', ""'Goodbye"", 'Girl', 'Paula', 'McFadden', 'Garfield', 'up', 'night', 'McFadden', 'was', 'dumped', 'actor-boyfriend', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'happened', 'soon', 'discover', 'Garfield', 'been', 'given', 'lease', 'apartment', 'McFadden', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'admirably', 'played', 'Quinn', 'Cummings', 'much', ""'action"", 'film', 'place', 'confines', 'apartment', 'primary', 'set', 'stage', 'play', 'relationship', 'Garfield', 'McFadden', 'negotiate', 'unsettled', 'truce', 'eventually', 'friendship', 'then', 'finally', 'love', 'affair', 'Lucy', 'providing', 'colour', 'commentary', 'way.Garfield', 'booked', 'play', 'Richard', 'III', 'worst', 'possible', 'interpretations', 'play', 'short', 'order', 'atrocious', 'reviews', 'McFadden', 'resurrect', 'dancing', 'career', 'realising', 'passed', 'realistic', 'age', 'most', 'Broadway', 'productions', 'certainly', 'time', 'When', 'Garfield', 'offer', 'lifetime', 'too', 'leave', 'town', 'setting', 'McFadden', 'up', 'failure', 'relationship', 'once', 'again', 'least', 'still', 'apartment', 'right', 'dialogue', 'comedic', 'realistic', 'same', 'time', 'rapid-fire', 'banter', 'classic', 'Simon', 'stage', 'screen', 'impossible', 'situations', 'cause', 'characters', 'be', 'constantly', 'verge', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'small', 'miracles', 'creep', 'keep', 'life', 'sane', 'are', 'also', 'far', 'more', 'true', 'life', 'most', 'people', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'admitting', 'Herbert', 'Ross', 'be', 'commended', 'direction', 'here', 'made', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'retaining', 'crucial', 'aspects', 'great', 'play.Everyone', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy/drama', 'serious', 'edge', 'ironic', 'undertow']",N/A

Garfield, was invented by master cartoonist Jim Davis just one year after the release of THE GOODBYE GIRl?  In interviews Davis readily admits that he borrowed the name of his feline creation from Richard Dreyfuss's character, the pushy actor Elliot Garfield, and not only the name, but his whole persona of the know it all smart aleck.  Methinks the recent animated version of GARFIELD should have used Richard Dreyfuss's voice instead of Bill Murray's.  Never mind, Dreyfuss has been laughing all the way to the bank ever since he won the Oscar at age 30 for playing the part in one of show business' most incredible and unaccountable upsets.  In Hollywood circles it has long been whispered that on that long ago Oscarcast, presenter Faye Dunaway (the previous year's Oscar winner for best actress) was feeling her oats when she blearily opened the envelope and read the wrong name as the winner.  It is said that John Travolta, who might conceivably have won the Oscar instead of Dreyfuss, has refused to speak to Dunaway ever since.THE GOODBYE GIRL, although sluggish in places and terribly overacted by Richard Dreyfuss (although, to give him credit, he was just doing what he was supposed to do), is far from the worst Neil Simon movie of the 1970s and indeed might be the best!  In fact the success of THE GOODBYE GIRL encouraged producers to keep hiring Neil Simon for another 10 years of imitations of this formula.  If GG hadn't succeeded we might have been spared some of the treacle that was to follow, including CHAPTER TWO (where Marsha Mason marries James Caan), SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES (with Goldie and Chevy) or ONLY WHEN I LAUGH (with Kristy McNichol playing the daughter of Marsha Mason).Luckily in this picture the growing friendship between Marsha Mason and the 60s starlet Joan Hackett met with distaste by Mason's husband, and he divorced her ending their incredible partnership not too long afterwards.  They had a crazy streak of hits and flops together and will go down in history as the man who wrote the worst parts for an actress with a little bit of talent.  After that, for Neil Simon it was Matthew Broderick pictures and the Alec Baldwin-Kim Basinger disaster THE MARRYING MAN.  For Marsha Mason, well, there was the tragedy of Joan Hackett's untimely death, one Clint Eastwood movie in which most of her part was cut out, and a welcome return to the big screen last year in BRIDE AND PREJUDICE",4,Hollywood's Golden Upset,1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,2478,"['Did', 'know', 'obnoxiously', 'humorous', 'fat', 'cat', 'Garfield', 'was', 'invented', 'master', 'cartoonist', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'just', 'one', 'year', 'release', 'THE', 'GOODBYE', 'GIRl', 'interviews', 'Davis', 'readily', 'borrowed', 'name', 'feline', 'creation', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'character', 'pushy', 'actor', 'Elliot', 'Garfield', 'not', 'only', 'name', 'whole', 'persona', 'know', 'smart', 'aleck', 'recent', 'animated', 'version', 'GARFIELD', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'voice', 'instead', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Never', 'mind', 'Dreyfuss', 'been', 'laughing', 'way', 'bank', 'ever', 'won', 'Oscar', 'age', '30', 'playing', 'part', 'one', 'show', 'business', 'most', 'incredible', 'unaccountable', 'upsets', 'Hollywood', 'circles', 'long', 'been', 'whispered', 'long', 'ago', 'Oscarcast', 'presenter', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'previous', 'year', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'best', 'actress', 'was', 'feeling', 'oats', 'when', 'blearily', 'opened', 'envelope', 'read', 'wrong', 'name', 'winner', 'said', 'John', 'Travolta', 'who', 'might', 'conceivably', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'instead', 'Dreyfuss', 'refused', 'speak', 'Dunaway', 'ever', 'since.THE', 'GOODBYE', 'GIRL', 'sluggish', 'places', 'terribly', 'overacted', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'give', 'credit', 'was', 'just', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', 'far', 'worst', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'movie', '1970s', 'indeed', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'fact', 'success', 'THE', 'GOODBYE', 'GIRL', 'encouraged', 'producers', 'keep', 'hiring', 'Neil', 'Simon', '10', 'years', 'imitations', 'formula', 'GG', 'had', ""n't"", 'succeeded', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'spared', 'treacle', 'was', 'follow', 'including', 'CHAPTER', 'TWO', 'where', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'James', 'Caan', 'SEEMS', 'LIKE', 'OLD', 'TIMES', 'Goldie', 'Chevy', 'WHEN', 'LAUGH', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'playing', 'daughter', 'Marsha', 'Mason', '.Luckily', 'picture', 'growing', 'friendship', 'Marsha', 'Mason', '60s', 'starlet', 'Joan', 'Hackett', 'met', 'distaste', 'Mason', 'husband', 'divorced', 'ending', 'incredible', 'partnership', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'afterwards', 'had', 'crazy', 'streak', 'hits', 'together', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'worst', 'parts', 'actress', 'little', 'bit', 'talent', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'was', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'pictures', 'Alec', 'Baldwin-Kim', 'Basinger', 'disaster', 'THE', 'MARRYING', 'MAN', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'well', 'was', 'tragedy', 'Joan', 'Hackett', 'untimely', 'death', 'one', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'cut', 'out', 'welcome', 'return', 'big', 'screen', 'last', 'year', 'BRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE']",N/A

Bernabo,"[1, 1]","Richard Dreyfuss won the Oscar for his performance in ""The Goodbye Girl,"" and Marsha Mason was married to the playwright, but I remember thinking that it young scene stealing Quinn Cummings who probably had more talent that the other two put together.  But then Cummings, after a nice turn on the classic TV domestic drama ""Family,"" has not been seen since ""Listen to Me,"" the 1988 film about college debaters starring Kirk Cameron and Jamie Gertz.  Meanwhile, it is Dreyfuss who has resurrected his career as an older curmudgeon.In ""The Goodbye Girl"" Dreyfuss plays a young curmudgeon, Elliot Garfield, a struggling actor who has made the fateful mistake of sub-letting an apartment in the Big Apple from a friend.  The problem is that the friend split town leaving behind his girl friend, Paula McFadden (Mason) and her daughter Lucy (Cummings), who are not thrilled with the idea of being put out on the street.  After a series of initial diatribes (including the classic scene where each lays down the law for the other in turn), an uneasy alliance is agreed upon and we wait for the inevitable meeting of much more than the minds between the feuding couple.The title of Neil Simon's play has to do with the fact that Paula always gets dumped in the end and the prospect of happiness does nothing to deter her absolute belief in the inevitability of her unhappiness.  An added treat in this film is Elliot's performance in Shakespeare's ""Richard III,"" which, as directed off-Broadway by Mark (Paul Benedict), insists the king was gay.  Really gay.  Incredibly, ... out of the closet and way over the rainbow gay.Most Romantic Line:  ""What is it about you that makes a man with a hundred forty-seven I.Q. feel like a dribbling idiot?""  What did you expect?  This is a Neil Simon story so there are dozens of great one-liners, none of them especially romantic.If you like ""The Goodbye Girl,"" then check out these other films on AFI's list: #38 ""It Happened One Night,"" #25 ""When Harry Met Sally,"" #17 ""Moonstruck,"" and #14  ""The African Queen.""

Directed by Herbert Ross (1927-2001, who later directed ""Steel Magnolias"" in 1989), the film stars Richard Dreyfuss as the aspiring actor Elliot Garfield, Marsha Mason as former dancer Paula McFadden and Quinn Cummings as Paula's 10-year old daughter Lucy.  The film begins with Paula and Lucy returning to their New York City apartment from a long day of shopping.  They are preparing to move to California with Paula's boyfriend, Tony Deforest (not shown), who is another aspiring actor that just got an acting job in a Hollywood film.  Upon getting home, Tony isn't there, but she finds a note that he left for her.  The note is not what Paula wanted or expected to hear: Tony left without her and Lucy.  Paula learns from building manager Mrs. Crosby (Theresa Merritt, 1924-1998) the next morning that loveable Tony did something else too: he sublet the apartment. Not having the money to move, Paula decides that she and Lucy will remain in the apartment.  When the subletee arrives (Elliot), she reluctantly agrees to share the apartment with him.  The resulting mutually antagonistic relationship slowly evolves into something quite different.For his work in ""The Goodbye Girl"", Richard Dreyfuss won the much deserved Oscar for Best Actor. Marsha Mason was nominated for Best Actress and Quinn Cummings was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.  The film itself was nominated for Best Picture and Neil Simon was nominated for Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.  Some of the very memorable scenes in the film include Paula & Lucy's arrival home at the beginning of the film, Elliot's arrival, the living arrangements, Elliot's rehearsals, Paula's exercises, Lucy's stomachache, Elliot's alternate employment, the Chianti, the rooftop dinner, the carriage ride and the closing scenes.  Other memorable characters include Elliot's off-Broadway director Mark (Paul Benedict, known for his portrayal of Harry Bentley in the 1975-1985 TV series ""The Jeffersons"") and Donna Douglas (Barbara Rhoades).Overall, I rate the 1977 version of ""The Goodbye Girl"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.

Back him with a cast and a director who understand timing and you have enough entertainment that you may even forget your popcorn.  Goodbye Girl is a case in point.I had first seen this movie in first release in 1977. Richard Dreyfuss as a middle aged still optimistic actor was so convincing that I later had trouble accepting him in younger roles. His fey rendering of Richard III and follow-up performance of his character an unexpectedly drunk Elliot Garfield more than earn his Best Actor Award. However the center of this movie is Marsh Mason as Paula McFadden and her daughter the precocious Quinn Cummings as Lucy McFadden.The McFadden women have been dumped on by a few too many men and are justifiably leery at the arrival of Elliot (yet another actor) into their lives and apartment.Looking backwards from 2013; the placement of unlikely people in an apartment or hotel room is a regular Simon technique. Best remembered in his play/TV series The Odd Couple, Goodbye Girl is the same idea but with room for romance. Paula is too dependent on men and not sufficiently professional to control her re-entry into the work place. This character is a nester, having greater focus on the hominess of her apartment and the health of daughter and boyfriend. I can therefore understand if some viewers find this work dated.That said, even Simon was impressed with his repartee. In at least two occasions he has a charter remark about the equality of conversation. Paula specifically notes that she would not like Elliot at all except for his skill with words. In general I have to agree. The banter keeps you alert and wanting more. There is chemistry between the leads. Not burn the house down take no prisoners lust, but a slower more mature, appreciation of each other's qualities.This is not Great moviemaking, or the best of Neil Simon. These terms however place a needless high bar on the concept of enjoyment. This is a very enjoyable movie. Come for a relaxing entertainment and come back again later. The Goodbye Girl can warm you and entertain you even after several replays.",4,"Neil Simon writing , Best Actor Richard Dryfus, with Marsha Mason and Herbert Ross directing .

The song at the end of the movie &#34;The Goodby Girl&#34; is one of my favorites.  I love to play it on the piano and when I play it I think of the days of my youth when I saw this movie.  I guess it is a woman's movie about love and loss and regaining love again.  That is about all it is about and that is enough if it is well acted.The only thing I hate in the movie is the part where Richard Dreyfuss has to act on stage in a play that is poorly directed.

It was in a very small theatre, and the people in the theatre could hear me non-stop laughing.  I really enjoyed this movie.  Since I am now married with children, I don't laugh as much when I watch it, but I could watch it over and over again and enjoy it.  I love the theme song, it really fit the movie.  My personal favorites are Richard Dreyfuss and his leaky phone booth, his chanting with burning incense, the panties drying on the rod, Marsha Mason working for the men from Subaro cars,  Dreyfuss as a bouncer,  Quinn's swearing when unexpected made it funny too.  This movie will always be dear to my heart.  For the people who have never had a chance to watch it,  please pick up a copy with Dreyfuss and Mason, do not watch the most recent one first (I personally didn't think it was any good, compare to this one.  This movie is not for children.  I would say teen and up only.  My oldest is 10 and I wouldn't let her watch this until she's in high school.  There are many adult situations.  But overall, it is really a movie that could be true to life and I found myself really getting into this movie and feeling really bad for Mason.
