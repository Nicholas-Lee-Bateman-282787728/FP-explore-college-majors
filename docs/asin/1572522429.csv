We witness some really interesting people here and they easily grab your attention, no matter what, they seem to share so many things with us at a time. The film oozes with decent performances, decent acting and direction. Susan Anspach is very amusing, delivers a very sattisfying performance so did the others. She is hot, she is innocent, she is honest, she is a totally genuine housewife who is honest to herself and with you too.

This is not to say that its not a good film. It may even be a great film.The story follows Marilyn Jordon (Susan Anspach) over several days leading up to New Years in Sweden. Marilyn is a bored housewife who seemingly has it all but is going slowly insane. Married to Bergman regular Erland Josephson she is the victim of a loveless marriage and a very stratified social circle.One holiday season she is detained at the airport while on her way to join her husband on a business trip and falls in with a group of Yugoslavian immigrants led by Alex Rossignol (Bora Todorovic) and her already shaky life begins to truly unravel.The immigrants are everything she is not. They are lustful (horny would probably be a better description) and fun loving. They run an earthy night club called the Zanzibar where just about anything can happen. Marilyn begins to experience life again with a lover, a zoo-keeper named Montenegro (Svetozar Cvetkovic). The problem is that this life can't go on forever and she must return to her family with some outrageous results.This is black comedy at its finest. It is a pointed satire of Bergman's work that even includes some familiar Bergman faces. The disc is out of print now but with some looking can be easily found. The Fox Lorber transfer is adequate despite some rather severe letterboxing. Look for a fine performance by Anspach and a dance by unknown Patricia Gelin with a tank that makes the whole quirky movie worthwhile.See it if you can.",4,Quirky Black Comedy Bergman Satire,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,1616,"['Dusan', 'Makavejev', 'Montenegro', 'not', 'typical', 'film', 'fact', 'one', 'strangest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'come', 'quite', 'awhile', 'not', 'say', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'great', 'film.The', 'story', 'Marilyn', 'Jordon', 'Susan', 'Anspach', 'several', 'days', 'leading', 'up', 'New', 'Years', 'Sweden', 'Marilyn', 'bored', 'housewife', 'who', 'seemingly', 'going', 'slowly', 'insane', 'Married', 'Bergman', 'regular', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'victim', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'very', 'stratified', 'social', 'circle.One', 'holiday', 'season', 'detained', 'airport', 'way', 'join', 'husband', 'business', 'trip', 'falls', 'group', 'Yugoslavian', 'immigrants', 'led', 'Alex', 'Rossignol', 'Bora', 'Todorovic', 'already', 'shaky', 'life', 'truly', 'unravel.The', 'immigrants', 'are', 'everything', 'not', 'are', 'lustful', 'horny', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'better', 'description', 'fun', 'loving', 'run', 'earthy', 'night', 'club', 'called', 'Zanzibar', 'where', 'just', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'Marilyn', 'experience', 'life', 'again', 'lover', 'zoo-keeper', 'named', 'Montenegro', 'Svetozar', 'Cvetkovic', 'problem', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'forever', 'must', 'return', 'family', 'outrageous', 'results.This', 'black', 'comedy', 'finest', 'pointed', 'satire', 'Bergman', 'work', 'even', 'familiar', 'Bergman', 'disc', 'print', 'now', 'looking', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'found', 'Fox', 'Lorber', 'transfer', 'adequate', 'rather', 'severe', 'letterboxing', 'Look', 'fine', 'performance', 'Anspach', 'dance', 'unknown', 'Patricia', 'Gelin', 'tank', 'whole', 'quirky', 'movie', 'worthwhile.See', 'can']",N/A

I only say that, because the few times I've watched it was on an adult cable channel.  I think it's the latter.  While it does have a good deal of sexual content (tastefully done), it's  more interesting as a story.  It's a wonderful tale of a bored housewife  and her journey of discovery.

But Anspach, the lovely wife has a lust and yearning for excitement or at least a change of pace. She meets a neat guy who is part of gypsy clan. Somehow she wanders away from home and gets into a group of gypsies. The man's name is Montenegro.  The vagabonds live a carefree life of abandon. Lots of love, lust and some women dancing in the buff for their own joy and group satisfaction. Anspach &quot;tries&quot; to resist Montenegro and their passion sizzles the screen. She adapts to the new life and seems more in it than to be a part of a family with a cockhold (dullard) of a husband. The end puzzled me in a way. Does she return for good or?I found the movie much more lively and enjoyable than the reviews. At the same time, this is NOT porn. The movie shows contrasting cultures (staid vs gypsy) and Anspach won my heart as well as admiration for her beauty and acting. I note a new version is coming out.  The 81 edition is excellent.  I am reluctant to part with this VHS.  It is worth watching two-four times at intervals and when in different moods.

186779,A2IY9M330NKBW6,1572522429,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","This is an absurdist tale. Things that are really strange are happening, but they make their own sense in the situation and become believable.Here's the scoop. Susan Anspach is an American expatriate married to an older Swedish man. They have a younger boy and girl and dad's 84 year old father is a nut-case who is trying to find a mail order bride. Susan is slipping into madness. She tries to poison the dog. She sees bugs where there are none. And eats an entire meal she has cooked for the family. While trying to accompany her hubby on a business trip they get separated at the airport and she ends up at the ""Zanzi-Bar"" with a bunch of Russian(?) gypsies, and a real wild ride ensues.This is one weird flick. Her husband is on the cold side and maybe gay. Grandpa's around the bend. She's holding on by her fingernails as she runs into a group of people that up-end her entire sense of civility and decorum. People fighting with shovels, people stabbing relatives in the head for cheating at cards and having sex in the open are all way contrary to anything she's ever experienced. But she finds a certain sense of liberation in it. She gets to like it and even joins in, as a singer, during the night's entertainment. She does finally see the absurdity in it all and heads home to a disastrous conclusion.This, as odd as it is, is supposedly based on a true story. It's shot in a rather plain fashion but the images speak for themselves. The arresting quality here is that you can't believe what you're seeing. And the director reminds us, through constant shots of various animals, what we really are underneath it all. The music is a mixed bag ranging from pop, to cabaret to orchestrated pieces.This is a great, oddball flick with a dash of eroticism to it.

I personally got so much from it from my first viewing, and yet I got the strange feeling that no one else in the theatre I was in really quite ""got it"", so to speak.  A lot of them laughed heartily, but they seemed to laugh at the apparent ""randomness"" of it, but none of it was random at all.  This is a very precise and firmly crafted piece of postmodern art.First of all, the climax is somewhat in the beginning when she says ""I hate being in this movie!"" and the very beginning is really the last shot.  A lot of situations that incited laughter only did so after the punchline had already been given moments beforehand.  A lot of this film is circuitous and self-reflexive, and everything breaks down so that any given meaning something may have eventually undermines itself later.  The thing that's excellent about it is how precise and organized it is at breaking everything down into structureless structure.  The acting is great but unnecessary because the characters just say what they're thinking/feeling/etc.  The story is of a bourgeois woman who falls in love with a man from a lower class and lives happily ever after... only not really.  Montenegro is a character only he's one of the most incidental and least important.  The children are the caretakers.  The adults are the adolescents.  And so on...This film gets a lot of laughs from its irony, but mostly it's a very tense film to try to watch, and I would have MUCH preferred watching it in private so that I wouldn't feel the tension mounting in the auditorium as people literally strained to try to make sense of it.

Few movies can thrill on first viewing the way this one did--I think of ""Law of Desire"" as one such movie and it is also dark, erotic and as visually stunning as Montenegro.  What struck me was the Bergman beginning and the Bunuel/Almodovar end.  The movie begins in the sterile (and of course Scandanavian) background of Bergman. Clean, sterile and boring except for Susan Anspach's constant fondling of her luxurious fur coat.  Then, with the sudden appearance of a black taxi driver in the white background of Sweden, one is driven to an incredible,almost unbelievable compound of gypsies who live amorally and happily--if not hysterically--in Zanzibar.  Here Montenegro appears, who was first seen in the Bergman portion working in a zoo.  So now, is this a dream or is it live--and where did the detour begin?  Ask yourself that when you think over the film--and you will think it over many times.  The dream like sequence is pure Bunuel--or even Almadovar as his wittiest, and complete with some of the most beautiful nudity and sex ever captured on screen.  The movie returns to Bergman, somewhere along the way--or does it?  Are we still dreaming at the end?  Even though the story is based on a true event, this interpretation of the real-life story is the only way to escape such a sad conclusion. This is the flip-side of the film ""Star 80"" in which Fosse grabbed us by the neck and shoved our faces into the true results of a gruesome murder, which is usually so clean and tidy in other films.  In Montenegro, even without knowing the details of the true story, we approach the nightmare and its antecedents and we can only imagine that we too are dreaming until we awaken.  This film, like ""Law of Desire"" is lush to look at, seductive to watch and will be very difficult to remove, if ever, from your memory.
