767260,A2ND7KO5Q8I86E,B0000AQS3T,DVD Sheikh,"[12, 13]","I think this show is just magnificent.  Everything about it is just magical.  Even though she was not cast until last minute, Jane Seymour was just the PERFECT lead actress as Dr. Mike Quinn.  I just finished the second season a few nights ago and am just being bored out of my mind because there aren't any good shows on TV anymore.  I can't wait until the third season comes out.  This series was one of the best ever to be created.  It had some of the best acting ever, and even the children did great work.  Every character had a chance to show what they were capable of and could accomplish.  This show is not just for old people; it's a show for all ages and could be watched with the entire family.  I'm only a fifteen year old and still find it quite fascinating.The DVDs themselves were also great.  The quality of the picture is simply perfect and much better than some of the episodes from the first season.  The sound is about the same.  All seven discs come in pretty cool individual boxes, like the average A&E; TV show box sets like the ""Mr. Bean"" DVD.  There is no booklet; instead the episode descriptions are on the back of each volume.  The cover of the entire case isn't exactly perfect.  It's kind of blurry and obvious that there were two different pictures stuck together.  The makers could have chosen a better front cover.  This product would be even better if there were subtitles and some pictures of each scene at the selection menu.The special features were much better than the first season's. Instead of one good thing, there were two brilliant things to watch.  The last disc contains ""Beginnings: A Featurette,"" which was really interesting.  You learn some interesting facts in it.  It was fun seeing how some of the actors looked like and changed over the past years.  There's also an interesting commentary by Joe Lando (Byron Sully) on the episode ""Best Friends.""  Some bloopers and deleted scenes might have been nice, along with some TV spots.  I don't think any season DVDs has had them before, besides ""Malcolm in the Middle.""  Hopefully, other actors will come back for other featurettes or show makings and do commentaries on more than one episode (the people that played important roles, like some of the MAIN characters, like the children).  It would also be interesting to know what the actors are doing nowadays, and why they did certain things: like why Erika Flores (Colleen Cooper) had left this amazing show.This box set certainly deserves 5 out 5 stars definitely because of the show itself and you should buy it NOW if you haven't done so already.  It's absolutely great; there's no doubt about it.  No show on TV now, like this one, can compare to it.  The price might be a minor problem for some and the future seasons possibly could and should be a little inexpensive.  It is an excellent addition to anyone's DVD collection.  I know this is a great one to mine; you can honestly watch all of the volumes over and over again and not get slightly bored at all.  Hopefully, the third season will be coming out on DVD SOON!  I just can't wait for it any longer.  You should get your copy when it comes out, because I will surely get mine.",5,One of the GREATEST Shows!!!,1070064000,"11 29, 2003",2003,3191,"['think', 'show', 'just', 'magnificent', 'Everything', 'just', 'magical', 'Even', 'was', 'not', 'cast', 'last', 'minute', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'was', 'just', 'PERFECT', 'lead', 'actress', 'Dr.', 'Mike', 'Quinn', 'just', 'finished', 'second', 'season', 'few', 'nights', 'ago', 'am', 'just', 'being', 'bored', 'mind', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'shows', 'TV', 'anymore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'third', 'season', 'out', 'series', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'be', 'created', 'had', 'best', 'acting', 'ever', 'even', 'children', 'did', 'great', 'work', 'Every', 'character', 'had', 'chance', 'show', 'what', 'were', 'capable', 'could', 'accomplish', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'old', 'people', 'show', 'ages', 'could', 'be', 'watched', 'entire', 'family', ""'m"", 'only', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'still', 'find', 'quite', 'fascinating.The', 'DVDs', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'quality', 'picture', 'simply', 'perfect', 'much', 'better', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'sound', 'same', 'seven', 'discs', 'come', 'pretty', 'cool', 'individual', 'boxes', 'average', 'A', 'E', 'TV', 'show', 'box', 'sets', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'DVD', 'booklet', 'instead', 'episode', 'descriptions', 'are', 'back', 'volume', 'cover', 'entire', 'case', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'perfect', 'kind', 'blurry', 'obvious', 'were', 'two', 'different', 'pictures', 'stuck', 'together', 'makers', 'could', 'have', 'chosen', 'better', 'front', 'cover', 'product', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'were', 'subtitles', 'pictures', 'scene', 'selection', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'Instead', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'were', 'two', 'brilliant', 'things', 'watch', 'last', 'disc', 'Beginnings', 'Featurette', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'learn', 'interesting', 'facts', 'was', 'fun', 'seeing', 'how', 'actors', 'looked', 'changed', 'past', 'years', 'also', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'Byron', 'Sully', 'episode', 'Best', 'Friends', 'bloopers', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'TV', 'spots', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'season', 'DVDs', 'had', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'Hopefully', 'other', 'actors', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'other', 'featurettes', 'show', 'makings', 'do', 'commentaries', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'people', 'played', 'important', 'roles', 'MAIN', 'characters', 'children', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'interesting', 'know', 'what', 'actors', 'are', 'doing', 'nowadays', 'why', 'did', 'certain', 'things', 'why', 'Erika', 'Flores', 'Colleen', 'Cooper', 'had', 'left', 'amazing', 'show.This', 'box', 'set', 'certainly', '5', '5', 'stars', 'definitely', 'show', 'should', 'buy', 'NOW', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'so', 'already', 'absolutely', 'great', 'doubt', 'No', 'show', 'TV', 'now', 'one', 'can', 'compare', 'price', 'might', 'be', 'minor', 'problem', 'future', 'seasons', 'possibly', 'could', 'should', 'be', 'little', 'inexpensive', 'excellent', 'addition', 'anyone', 'DVD', 'collection', 'know', 'great', 'one', 'mine', 'can', 'honestly', 'watch', 'volumes', 'over', 'again', 'not', 'get', 'slightly', 'bored', 'Hopefully', 'third', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'SOON', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'longer', 'should', 'get', 'copy', 'when', 'out', 'will', 'surely', 'get', 'mine']",N/A
767261,A1WWNCPWNQTGYP,B0000AQS3T,Empyreal,"[8, 10]","I have always loved Dr. Quinn, although I was at a loss for words to explain the reason for the love. I think I found the reason though. As they said in the special feature, the show is about the human condition. It portrays our daily struggles, weaknesses, prejudices, and triumphs. Even though it is set in the 1860s-70s, people today can still relate to it. Historically, it even does a decent job of portraying the Cheyenne, following neither the romanticized nor savage view of them.Beth Sullivan is a wonderfully talented writer, and the actors and actresses are magnificent. The show promotes strong values, without the audience feeling like those values are being stuffed down their throats. And it isn't unrealistic in the portrayal. Granted problems are solved quickly in order to fit within its time slot, they are still real problems. None of the characters is perfect or even comes close to perfect. Even those, such as Jake and Horace, who are not the main characters have depth. Therefore, through the writing of Sullivan and the acting brings the world of Dr. Quinn to life.Dr. Quinn was most definitely a rarity in television shows, and it is a pity that they cancelled it.As for the special features on the DVD - there aren't many of them, but it does include a short featurette about the show, which includes many interviews. There is a short biography about some of the actors/actresses, and credits awards that the show has received. While I think they should have included more special features, the show is so wonderful that I am not going to give it less than 5 stars because of this lack.",5,"Awesome show, great DVD set",1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,1613,"['have', 'always', 'loved', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'was', 'loss', 'words', 'explain', 'reason', 'love', 'think', 'found', 'reason', 'though', 'said', 'special', 'feature', 'show', 'human', 'condition', 'daily', 'struggles', 'weaknesses', 'prejudices', 'triumphs', 'Even', 'set', '1860s-70s', 'people', 'today', 'can', 'still', 'relate', 'Historically', 'even', 'decent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Cheyenne', 'following', 'romanticized', 'savage', 'view', 'them.Beth', 'Sullivan', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'writer', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'magnificent', 'show', 'strong', 'values', 'audience', 'feeling', 'values', 'are', 'being', 'stuffed', 'down', 'throats', ""n't"", 'unrealistic', 'portrayal', 'Granted', 'problems', 'are', 'solved', 'quickly', 'order', 'fit', 'time', 'slot', 'are', 'still', 'real', 'problems', 'None', 'characters', 'perfect', 'even', 'close', 'perfect', 'Even', 'such', 'Jake', 'Horace', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'depth', 'Therefore', 'writing', 'Sullivan', 'acting', 'world', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'life.Dr', 'Quinn', 'was', 'most', 'definitely', 'rarity', 'television', 'shows', 'pity', 'cancelled', 'it.As', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'include', 'short', 'featurette', 'show', 'many', 'interviews', 'short', 'biography', 'actors/actresses', 'credits', 'awards', 'show', 'received', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'show', 'so', 'wonderful', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'less', '5', 'stars', 'lack']",N/A
