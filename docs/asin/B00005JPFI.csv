I saw stuntmen propelled in the air for ""Fire hose Rodeo,"" skiing down a stairwell with artificial snow, and a mini loop motorcycle stunt.  What I was expecting was `Candid Camera' meets ""X""-treme sports novelties.  What I mainly got was a ""hybrid""* of 'Fear Factor'.  I was misled.Favorably, it all starts out with a bull run that is harrowing and impressively shot.  Later, one of the best scenes is a Hollywood movie parody.  (Even though there's no plot, per say, the scene is so impressive, that if you must see it, I wouldn`t dare spoil it for you.)  In their defense, they certainly are inventive with every stunt they pull.Then, it gets morbid.  Sight gags with snake bites, stunts with shattered glass, and leeches shown to host on a man's ""private parts"" and his eyeball are definitely an acquired taste.  In one scene, a ""phallic"" image is branded to one stalwart's b--t.  To ensure authenticity, they have to show the blood afterwards with participants writhing in pain and onlookers laughing--like it were `The Three Stooges' gone `Gladiator`.  (I don't remember laughing at people getting hurt since I was six, but, maybe, it's just me.)  Granted the stunt men are professionals and their caveat--to paraphrase, ""Don't try this at home, kids--"" is amply posted, but I didn`t find it entertaining.  Male b--t shots, feces, vomiting, and actors dressed as elderly people with fake genitals hanging out of garments are the obsessive bill of fare presented.  (To their credit, their inventive hijinx is only fractionally represented here.)I felt like I had entered an impressive carnival and left a freak show that mainly made me feel queasy.""Let the buyer beware?"" Maybe.  Not asking for a refund, I, nonetheless, would like other thrill seekers to make an informed decision before entering this circus tent.*with elements that remind one of the initials associated with Marquis de Sade.",2,Surprise!

Maybe that's it- they've hit their heads so many times they can't remember what it's like to care! :)Anyway, I enjoy the movie, but I really hope these young guys don't already have permanent brain damage that will affect their ability to talk and walk years from now.  My favorite part was the bull riding scene.  That was pretty hysterical.  Also I loved when they put all those bees in the car, and when they tried to escape, the ground was covered in marbles so they would trip over them.  Nothing like getting stung and trippin' over marbles!This movie was MUCH more disgusting than the previous Jackass movie.

Then there are some parts of the movie where as I found...well...kinda boring.Lets start with the good parts. It's good to see the crew back for the sequel, Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, and others. I really don't want to give the whole movie away, unless you've seen it already, but there are parts where people do insane stunts within this movie. They do stunts that the average kid is scared of or haven't thought about doing. There are some that will gross you out. Also there is a lot of vomit in this movie, so don't be like me and eat while watching this movie, and end up loosing you appitite.As for the bad, this movie is like listening to a CD with boring tracks. The scenes fall under skip material. It's not that they are bad scenes with pointless stunts. It's just that they are not amusing to me, or I didn't find funny. And believe me, there are a lot of those here that I didn't find funny at all.Jackass Number Two to me falls under an average DVD release. There really isn't anything too special about this movie that is guranteed to blow your mind. If you loved the series that was once on MTV, as well as the first movie, then you will fully enjoy this here. The deleted scenes and the outtakes are reasonably good as well. It wouldn't suprise me to find out there is going to be a part 3 to this series. But as for the movie here, it's worth checking out, if you are into crazy stunts and looking for humor. Peace!!Update (and hopefully this will be posted): I get a bunch of unhelpful votes in my review because I said this movie had funny parts here, and yet the reviewer below me gets almost 100% helpful votes because he basically said in about seven paragraphs on how stupid a movie like this was. People, learn to be humorous once in a while. This movie was intended to be made for laughs. Learn to grow up and enjoy things like, and stop trying to follow what one objective reviewer says. I understand that opinions differ, but come on. I'm pretty sure that if anyone is mature enough to not try the stunts in the movie at home, or they deserve to get hurt. Learn to laugh and be entertained at movies like this, and stop trying to pretend like this movie is such a bad influence.

650005,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPFI,Chris Pandolfi,"[6, 9]","A review for a film like ""Jackass: Number Two"" has to be constructed differently; it's not a film with a plot so much as it's a collection of nearly unwatchable clips. The trailer for this film flashed some of the negative reviews for 2002's ""Jackass: The Movie"" across the screen: I distinctly remember one from a Christian newsletter claiming it was ""a sad commentary on our degenerating culture."" There's truth to that statement; only those of remarkably low standards could subject themselves to a series of reckless, painful, and disgusting stunts. Of course, that's probably why it found an audience. So is it any wonder that a second helping of utter stupidity came along? This new film is just as low grade and twice as nauseating as its predecessor, filled to the brim with pure, unabashed shamelessness.And yet, I'm giving it four stars--four stars for a film that doesn't deserve any. How can this be? I consider myself a fairly normal person that enjoys fairly normal activities. I also consider myself to be reasonably sane; not only would I never attempt any of the stunts performed by the ""Jackass"" bunch, I would never encourage anyone else to attempt them, as well. However, there's a small part of me that gets a kick out of reckless endangerment, the part stimulated at an early age by the violent yet undeniably funny antics of Saturday morning cartoons. I think, to some degree, we all have that part. Don't believe me? Consider ABC's ""America's Funniest Home Videos""; while it is a tame show, it still makes an impression in much the same way that ""Jackass"" does. It uses footage of ill-conceived stunts and painful outcomes to generate laughs.""Jackass"" was originally a television show that ran from 2000 to 2002 on the MTV network. It started as a way for actor Johnny Knoxville to test various self-defense devices on his own body (with a list including tazers and mace). It then grew into a regularly aired program and featured Bam Margera, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Preston Lacy, Ryan Dunn, Dave England, and Jason ""Wee Man"" Acuna (among others). Every show opened with a disclaimer, one that emphatically stated no one should ever attempt any of the stunts they see. (Both films open in the same way.) Despite this legal technicality, the show has been blamed for the injuries and deaths of numerous teens. It also caused quite a stir for Joseph Liberman, Al Gore's vice presidential candidate in the 2000 election. His attempts to get it off the air backfired, only leading to the alienation of young Democratic voters and the resentment of the cast and crew.After the show's cancellation, the cast reunited in 2002 for the first film, which earned a respectable $60 million during its first weekend. This was my first exposure to the ""Jackass"" phenomenon, which I admit might have been too much for me to handle. Knoxville and his equally demented gang of thrill-seekers were finally free of television censorship, meaning the recklessness of their stunts dramatically increased. I watched feeling both awe and repulsion; with every bruise, scar, concussion, cut, and scrape they earned, I began to think that they must consider such marks as badges of honor. I can't say the same thing for all the inedible things they ate or for the rotten odors they forced themselves to breathe; these exploits were over the top at a level most people could never reach.Four years later, we have ""Number Two,"" a film that does the exact opposite of raising the bar. I can only describe a handful of the stunts it has to offer (most of them are simply too disgusting and/or dangerous to repeat on a public website). Here are some of the ""highlights"" in no particular order. A topless, morbidly obese woman pounces on Wee Man in a prank featuring John Waters. Knoxville and Pontius wrestle an anaconda in a pool of plastic balls. An imposter replaces Bam's father to play a naughty bedtime prank on his mother. Some of the cast members sit on a rocket-powered bicycle that zooms into a lake. A special airbag is strategically placed behind a door, ready to punch anyone who dares to ring the bell. Last and certainly least; an elaborate prank goes too far when one of the cast members dresses as a terrorist and hitches a ride on a cab.There was another stunt that demands some examining. Early on, Dunn heats a penis-shaped branding iron and marks Bam's right buttock (the first of many naked rear ends seen in this film). Bam later shows the infected scar to his mother. Her reaction was strange; while she's understandably shocked, she's also quite passive about her son's lack of good judgment. How can anyone accept such radical behavior, especially when it could potentially cost a life? Dunn confesses that he was the one holding the iron, and it led to a cold yet compelling statement. When asked why he would do such a thing, he simply says, ""Because it was funny."" And there you have it: a phrase that explains the purpose of the entire ""Jackass"" franchise. It also explains why it's so popular with American twenty-somethings.No one in good conscience can recommend ""Jackass: Number Two."" Even with four stars, I'm not even considering doing that. The high rating is not related to the belief that it's suitable for mainstream audiences. Rather, it's based on my opinions of the cast and crew. I guess I admire such an uninhibited mindset; anyone who fully accepts the consequences of self-inflicted bodily harm must be a very secure person. Still, one wonders if he or she can't get a less dangerous adrenaline rush. To say that these performers are stupid would be kind.

650006,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B00005JPFI,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[55, 67]","I liked ""Jackass"" and I liked this new one even better. What Johnny Knoxville and his merry band of idiots have done brilliantly is use this countries political correctness against them. They know what is funny far better than the PC crowd. Terrorists, funny. Naked grandmas, funny. People hurting themselves, funny. For years we have been adding things to our ""Not Funny"" list and thus eliminating them from our movies. That means that our multiplexes are filling up with toothless, light-hearted films masquerading as comedies. In an ad for this film a crowded theater filled with people engaging in uproarious laughter is showed. Then the ad asks when the last time was that you had an experience like that. My guess is that it wasn't during ""Rumor Has It,"" or ""Big Momma's House 2,"" or ""Just My Luck."" So the way I see it the Jackass gang is reminding us what it's like to laugh. Or put another way, they're bringing funny back.That is not to say that all of their stunts are golden. Some, such as the medicine ball dodge ball, seem uninspired. Others were too much for me to handle. I could've lived without the leech on the eyeball, and the fish hook, and especially the horse milk. But without trying everything they may never have come across more hilarious ones such as the puppet show and the bungee jump. The best were the pranks with Spike Jonze as a naked grandma and Johnny Knoxville as a bad grandpa. The one where the bad grandpa gets in a fight with a ""hippie"" over his parenting technique was divine. And I ask you, who is the real jackass in that stunt, Knoxville or the nosy pedestrian who is being Punk'd? I also think Knoxville should get some credit for holding this film together. His flair for theatrics has gotten better since the original, probably due to his movie star experiences. And that cackling laughter of his works the same way as a laugh track on a sitcom. I mean if the guy with his arm in the bear trap is having the time of his life then why aren't you? I did feel at times that the directing was too polished. It should have been grittier so as not to nullify the pain these people were in.If all stupid movies were as much fun as this one I would never complain about the dumbing down of Hollywood. I can't remember the last time 95 minutes went by so quickly. I do wonder if parents still think video games are quite as harmful as they used to. Back in the day playing outside meant tossing the football around with the neighbors. Today it means riding a shopping cart into a brick wall. I would never have the nerves of steel, or desire, to swim with sharks, but I had a blast watching these guys do it. Finally, I would like to officially state that I will be first in line as soon as they make number 3 (whatever that means). ***3/4",4,Good Clean Violent Gay Fun,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,2778,"['liked', 'Jackass', 'liked', 'new', 'one', 'even', 'better', 'What', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'merry', 'band', 'idiots', 'have', 'done', 'brilliantly', 'use', 'countries', 'political', 'correctness', 'know', 'what', 'funny', 'far', 'better', 'PC', 'crowd', 'Terrorists', 'funny', 'Naked', 'grandmas', 'funny', 'People', 'hurting', 'funny', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'adding', 'things', 'Not', 'Funny', 'list', 'thus', 'eliminating', 'movies', 'multiplexes', 'are', 'filling', 'up', 'toothless', 'light-hearted', 'films', 'masquerading', 'comedies', 'ad', 'film', 'crowded', 'theater', 'filled', 'people', 'engaging', 'uproarious', 'laughter', 'showed', 'Then', 'ad', 'when', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'had', 'experience', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", 'Rumor', 'Has', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', '2', 'Just', 'My', 'Luck', 'way', 'see', 'Jackass', 'gang', 'reminding', 'what', 'laugh', 'put', 'way', ""'re"", 'bringing', 'funny', 'back.That', 'not', 'say', 'stunts', 'are', 'golden', 'such', 'medicine', 'ball', 'dodge', 'ball', 'seem', 'uninspired', 'Others', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'could', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'leech', 'eyeball', 'fish', 'hook', 'especially', 'horse', 'milk', 'trying', 'everything', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'come', 'more', 'hilarious', 'ones', 'such', 'puppet', 'show', 'bungee', 'jump', 'best', 'were', 'pranks', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'naked', 'grandma', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'bad', 'grandpa', 'one', 'where', 'bad', 'grandpa', 'fight', 'hippie', 'parenting', 'technique', 'was', 'divine', 'ask', 'who', 'real', 'jackass', 'stunt', 'Knoxville', 'nosy', 'pedestrian', 'who', 'being', 'Punk', ""'d"", 'also', 'think', 'Knoxville', 'should', 'get', 'credit', 'holding', 'film', 'together', 'flair', 'theatrics', 'gotten', 'better', 'original', 'probably', 'due', 'movie', 'star', 'experiences', 'cackling', 'laughter', 'same', 'way', 'laugh', 'track', 'sitcom', 'mean', 'guy', 'arm', 'bear', 'trap', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'then', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'did', 'feel', 'times', 'directing', 'was', 'too', 'polished', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'grittier', 'so', 'not', 'nullify', 'pain', 'people', 'were', 'in.If', 'stupid', 'movies', 'were', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'one', 'would', 'never', 'complain', 'dumbing', 'Hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', '95', 'minutes', 'went', 'quickly', 'do', 'wonder', 'parents', 'still', 'think', 'video', 'games', 'are', 'quite', 'as', 'harmful', 'used', 'Back', 'day', 'playing', 'outside', 'meant', 'tossing', 'football', 'neighbors', 'Today', 'riding', 'shopping', 'cart', 'brick', 'wall', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'nerves', 'steel', 'desire', 'swim', 'sharks', 'had', 'blast', 'watching', 'guys', 'do', 'Finally', 'would', 'like', 'officially', 'state', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'line', 'as', 'soon', 'make', 'number', '3', '***3/4']",N/A

Chris Pontius gets pecked on the peck-r by a hungry snake, Johnny Knoxville feeds his arm to an anaconda, Dave England gets a good sac-vac courtesy of a lovely leech, one of which then later chomps on Steve-o's cornea.  And that, my friends, is the tame stuff.It seems like the Jackass gang was really determined to outdo themselves with this sequel, and outdo they did.  In fact, the danger level is ratcheted up so much higher, I would encourage everyone to really try and savor this edition, because if this crew attempts to get even a little more crazy the next time (if there is one), then I'm afraid one of them is gonna end up biting it.  And I don't mean a snake or a leech either.  I mean biting the big one.Johnny Knoxville, I guess, must not be altogether pleased with where his non-Jackass movie career is going - 'cause what else can account for his increased death wish in this installment?  Forget about the ""yak charge"": I honestly don't know how he survived the ""toro totter"" or (especially) the ""big red rocket"" (and all who were present indeed admitted that it almost killed him during the first aborted try).  Heck - even the ""bicentennial bmxing"" and the ""riot control test"" are pushing the limits of mortality at his age.But regardless of his reasoning, I'm glad he decided to do it and that he made it through (relatively) unscathed, because this is by far the better of the two Jackass films.  The gags are funnier and the stunts are crazier.The Unrated DVD is exceptional, too.  Packed with goodies, even the chapter selections are done well (i.e. there are many (55) and they are well-labeled, so you can easily jump to your favorite scenes).  The commentary track is hilarious - they are all such a bunch of funny guys that I could probably listen to and laugh at their commentary about almost any movie, let alone one in which they actually appear. They're almost like the skaterboy version of the MST3K robots.There's also a 29 minute ""behind the scenes"" ""making of"" documentary, and 5 minutes of unrated scenes (unrated because each one contains a wiener or two).And though I guess it goes without saying at this point, I still feel obligated to leave you with this disclaimer: if you have any problems with seeing copious quantities of poo or penii, then stay far away from this DVD (or I guess I could just steal the line that Bam Margera himself uses, in his intro to the deleted scenes: ""Look away, 'cause we're gettin' gay"").",4,Enjoy This Gang Before One of Them Bites It!,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,2612,"['course', 'Jackass', 'Number', 'Two', 'huh', 'huh', 'huh', 'huh', 'said', 'Number', 'Two', 'numerous', 'people', 'are', 'bitten', 'numerous', 'things', 'numerous', 'places', 'Chris', 'Pontius', 'pecked', 'peck-r', 'hungry', 'snake', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'arm', 'anaconda', 'Dave', 'England', 'good', 'sac-vac', 'courtesy', 'lovely', 'leech', 'one', 'then', 'later', 'chomps', 'Steve-o', 'cornea', 'friends', 'tame', 'stuff.It', 'Jackass', 'gang', 'was', 'really', 'determined', 'outdo', 'sequel', 'did', 'fact', 'danger', 'level', 'ratcheted', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'higher', 'would', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'really', 'try', 'savor', 'edition', 'crew', 'get', 'even', 'little', 'more', 'crazy', 'next', 'time', 'one', 'then', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'one', 'gon', 'end', 'up', 'biting', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'snake', 'leech', 'either', 'mean', 'biting', 'big', 'one.Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'guess', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'altogether', 'pleased', 'where', 'non-Jackass', 'movie', 'career', 'going', ""'cause"", 'what', 'else', 'can', 'account', 'increased', 'death', 'wish', 'installment', 'Forget', 'yak', 'charge', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'survived', 'toro', 'totter', 'especially', 'big', 'red', 'rocket', 'who', 'were', 'present', 'indeed', 'admitted', 'almost', 'killed', 'first', 'aborted', 'try', 'Heck', 'even', 'bicentennial', 'bmxing', 'riot', 'control', 'test', 'are', 'pushing', 'limits', 'mortality', 'age.But', 'regardless', 'reasoning', ""'m"", 'glad', 'decided', 'do', 'made', 'relatively', 'unscathed', 'far', 'better', 'two', 'Jackass', 'films', 'gags', 'are', 'funnier', 'stunts', 'are', 'crazier.The', 'Unrated', 'DVD', 'exceptional', 'too', 'Packed', 'goodies', 'even', 'chapter', 'selections', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'i.e', 'are', 'many', '55', 'are', 'well-labeled', 'can', 'easily', 'jump', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'track', 'hilarious', 'are', 'such', 'bunch', 'funny', 'guys', 'could', 'probably', 'listen', 'laugh', 'commentary', 'almost', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'actually', 'appear', ""'re"", 'almost', 'skaterboy', 'version', 'MST3K', 'robots.There', 'also', '29', 'minute', 'scenes', 'making', 'documentary', '5', 'minutes', 'unrated', 'scenes', 'unrated', 'one', 'wiener', 'two', 'guess', 'saying', 'point', 'still', 'feel', 'obligated', 'leave', 'disclaimer', 'have', 'problems', 'seeing', 'copious', 'quantities', 'poo', 'penii', 'then', 'stay', 'far', 'away', 'DVD', 'guess', 'could', 'just', 'steal', 'line', 'Bam', 'Margera', 'intro', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Look', 'away', ""'re"", 'gettin', 'gay']",N/A

I had never seen the tv show before, but my brother said the movie was funny. He was right.  Jackass the movie is a five star movie in my opinion. The gags were a great combination of gross, painful to watch and just plain silly.So I was excited to hear that the boys had gotten back together to make another Jackass movie. In the making of the film, we are told that the second installment is much better than the first.  Knoxville makes the comment that there were things that were in the first film that he didn't think were that great looking back on it.  Not so of the second he tells us.I have to disagree with him.  While I found Jackass II to be funny and entertaining, it wasn't nearly as good as the first one.  There were times in this movie that I thought they were just ""phoning"" it in.  The gags weren't as creative as the first and there were cast members from the first that were missing from the second, despite the fact that in the making of documentary Knoxville said that all of the cast was back for the second.  Not true.  Where is Raab?  Where is Rake?  Not only that but there was no mention of Brandon DiCamillo in the opening credits, yet he appears in the film, although very briefly and has no real involvement in any of the gags.Pontius has very little involvement in the gags compared to the first one, although the horse milking gag was one of the best in the film. Why?  Pontius was hilarious in the first one with his Party Boy scenes.  Party Boy isn't to be found here at all, other than in the closing credits as an afterthought.The first film seemed to have more chemistry amongst the cast.

Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Steve-O, Ryan Dunn, Wee Man, Preston Lacy, Dave England, and Ehren McGhehey get chased by bulls, hit in the face, kicked in the nuts, give a kid alcohol (wink-wink), throw up, walk around naked, rig chairs with electric currents, dump bees into a limo, brand themselves, get shot with 500-mile per hour rubber balls, dress up as terrorists,defecate A LOT, pierce fishhooks through their cheeks, ride a firehose, and much more outrageous stuff.

Well, just incase you didn't believe every other critic, yes it does. You would never catch me seeing some stupid teen comedy or slasher flick in the theater (or on DVD for that matter), but I was first in line for Jackass- Number Two because that's my guilty pleasure. Sure there were plenty of frat boy idiots in the theater with me who probably won't see a movie till Dane Cook's Employee Of The Month comes out, but Jackass will satisfy those even with the most distinguished taste in movies. The last time I laughed that loud and hard in a theater was probably The 40 Year-Old Virgin. The movie is just a longer version of what the show was. All it consists of is the gang doing crazy stunts, playing horrible pranks on each other, making animals really mad, and putting nasty things in their mouth. Now, the target audience of this movie are high school and college students. So, I'm sure that people over 35 will have no interest in seeing this movie whatsoever. Jackass will make even the strongest of the strong cringe from what they do. Does Steve-O attach a leach to his eyeball? Yes. Does Chris Pontius drink the semen of a horse? Yes. Do you get to see Wee Man's genitals? Yes. Also, yes, Johnny Knoxville does strap himself to a rocket. So, is Jackass entertaining? Absolutely. It just gets kinda old after the one hour mark.ACTING: N/ABottom Line: Jackass can wait for DVD, it's not a must see.

Then there will be the parts where vomit will rise up in your throat at some of the stunts and you'll be wondering if you can make it out of the theater before you throw up.  That's a tribute to the stunt work here and the sense of danger.  In the ""Ice Horse"" Brandon has to drop his pants (in chilly weather), douse his balls with Evian, then take a ride on a horse carved out of ice to see if his underside winds up freezing along with the horse.  At first he's hesitant, his hand at his belt.  Johnny Knoxville advises, ""Don't even think, just do it,"" and I guess that's the way they got through these new adventures, because if they gave any of them any thought they'd have backed off and called in sick that day.Or there's the variety of stunt where, like CANDID CAMERA, the boys are not told what's going to happen to them.  A limo takes the crew to what they think will be a photo shoot but instead thousands of angry bees are pumpe through the skylight.  When they try to escape, first the locks are jammed then, when they finally fall out of the car, the lot is covered with what must be 20,000 marbles and there's no way out except crawling on your hands and knees with glass under your kneecaps and the queen bee on your neck.  Afterwards you can't help thinking, is there a caste system on JACKASS, so that the lower paid guys have to suffer the most and the stars get put through a few showy stunts and that's it?In general everyone has aged pretty well but they could stand to pledge some new faces, for a few of our heroes are looking puffy, bloated, drugged out, or otherwise not as fresh as they looked in Volume I nor on the TV show, and because it's all about the butt, Chris Pontius should surrender his throne now and give it up to a boy who still has got a bit of jelly to him and not so much sag.

650043,A3V2THQU2RQ1AG,B00005JPFI,Molly C.,"[0, 7]","Well, you should already know the premise by now. It is a group of jackasses performing jackass stunts and jokes. Johnny Knoxville is the ring leader, Steve-O the masochist, and Bam Margera gets naked. I felt a little let down this time, as a lot of the stunts were too contrived and at times completely fake. I guess you can call them magicians instead of jackasses as they were just creating illusions to entertain us- complete with a musical straight out of Vegas. And I am being serious. They really do sing and dance at the end of this.The bull sequence at the beginning clearly featured CGI effects. People in the background of other scenes were obviously actors and not real stunned bystanders. They are required to sign either a release or a contract if they are featured in a film, but their faces are clearly shown on camera. I do not buy that every person on the street agreed to sign a release with no pay.The ""card in the [...]"" sequence with Weeman stood out in particular. During a trick they are playing on Weeman, they were shocking him in a chair while a card chark tries to throw cards into his [...]crack. For their next shot, they ask Weeman to sit with the card already in his [...] crack to look as though the card shark had thrown it there perfectly. They say they are editing the footage to make it look good. I am sure this is not the first time they edited footage to fool an audience.I think the average viewer would see this as entertainment. But considering I am in the film industry, I can spot actors, SFX, and way too many holes in their tricks for me to be completely entertained. I felt disappointed and a little betrayed as an audience member. They pawn this off as real when it is not. James Frey sold his fictional novel as a memoir and his readers got refunds. Do I?I will add that there was a funny scene that almost brought me to tears. Johnny dresses as Bad Grandpa & Old Man. In one scene, he has a fake ball sack dangling from his short shorts as he encounters various people on the street. At one point a dog attacks his sack and will not let go. An entire film could be dedicated to this character and make money.The last big joke is when they have one of their friends tricked into thinking he is being held hostage by a gun toting taxi driver. This was funny too, but as you see during the end credits, there are missing shots and dialogue from that scene which leads me to believe that too was fake.P.S. Homoerotic elements abound. Every guy gets naked or touches each other at some point.

650057,A24L13Q1GJAS6U,B00005JPFI,"The Cruelly Mad Emperor Caligula ""Little Boots""","[13, 33]","Contrary to moral relativists and Jackass apologists who downplay Jackass 2 as comedy or the immaturity common among teenagers, Jackass 2's popularity--and the following of the Jackass franchise--is an implication of where American and western society's heading: into the gutter of depraved indecency!!!! An incrimination of the low-mindedness lowlifes celebrate in this Jackass 2 movie was seen when it defied all odds of sanity or justice by debuting at number one when it came out!!!! In analyzing Jackass 2's noticeable success, where even the makers of the movie had to be self-deprecating about their chances of repeating the success from the first movie, one has to resist the temptation to write off the moviegoers as merely asinine and misled teens. Ghoulishly, many immature and dissolute adults entertain their lowbrow, inner desires by buying this DVD.Jackass 2 cannot qualify as a movie since movies have a plot, maybe a theme, some conflict, and character development. Flagrantly, Jackass 2 is more of the same mischief: Knoxville, Steve-O, Pontius et al connive to get together for more anti-social stunts which are just perilous and self-destructive. Many teenagers, clearly neglected by their parents and free to pursue copying Jackass' stunts due to feeling a void in their useless lives, have imitated Jackass' toxic stunts, so these films and series are definitely affecting society in a polluting way.An impartial count by the ""Screen-It"" Movie Review website found 135 f-words, 39 MoFos, 19 d#@k/c---su#*er, and 22 a#@holes. This is only the beginning of the lewd profanity unconvincingly described as ""comedy"" that's scattered throughout Jackass 2. It has no redeemable qualities because the ""humor"" isn't funny; it's simply slapping together unconventionally perverse situations which get the audience to utter nervous laughter due to the shocking perversity of the stunts. For instance, semen is lustfully collected from the erect p*nis of a horse, and a man has a phallus (for all the mentally immature adults viewing Jackass 2, they'll need to check a dictionary for the definition of phallus) blasted up his derriere!!!! Nothing is even remotely ""funny"" about this; if one finds this ""funny"" there are only three choices. Either they're being intellectually dishonest, have the maturity level of an anti-social teen, or are so obscenely deteriorated.The overall ratings for Jackass 2 should be one star at the most if we lived in a morally upstanding society, but we don't, regrettably. Egregious nudity to get the moral-reprobate audience off is rampant with men and women totally nude; again, there's nothing ""funny"" or remotely defensible about this nudity since it's softcore p*rn. Worse than this is the miscreant means for which human nudity is misused: for instance, a man's p*nis is actually put through the hole of a snake cage. The reviewers mendaciously defending this sm*t-film are villains. From this content of the movie, you'd seriously have to be debauched, mentally underdeveloped, or just asinine to enjoy this. ""Movies"" such as this used to be relegated to red-light districts, and most of Jackass 2 is more extreme and shocking than any snuff or p*rn film.The only abominations remotely capable of being passed off as lowlife humor are scenes of drinking horse semen (Fear Factor never stooped this low), eating horse manure, the stimulating sight of freshly passed human excrement, and stoners and drunks vomiting in graphic glorification!!!! With all these increasingly damning descriptions of the content of Jackass 2, it's clear that the only people enjoying this depravity are mentally ill, as it's incrementally clear that no sane or good human being could derive entertainment value from this degeneration.Besides these contraventions of human dignity, Jackass 2 endorses abysmally unethical misconduct and/or harmful misconduct. Alcohol is used in almost every other scene; Knoxville is in a scene corrupting a child, as this child drinks alcohol from a brown paper bag; Bam has his b*tt branded several times, resulting in three brandings of a p*nis and a scrotum outline; and one probably liberal and therefore hopelessly lost man has his scrotum frozen to small ice sculptures and when it does, Knoxville pushes him off so hard that pubic hair and excrement remain on the sculptures!!!!All the other reviewers except for me were unscrupulously downplaying the noxiousness of Jackass 2 by disguising it as mere immaturity or humor--that's why they deceitfully omitted presenting the content of the DVD. In grim reality, even immature teens or p*rverts couldn't really get a rise out of Jackass if they tried; one must be mentally ill or a complete rogue to tolerate this end-of-the-world sacrilege passed off as a movie. I watched the DVD just to be able to unmask all the sm*t init. After reading my review of Jackass' content, how can any sane or moral person buy this foulness?!",1,Want to know why teenagers are so gosh-darn screwed-up these days?

All in all Johnny Knoxville reigns the star as he did in the first movie doing the more crude painfull thingsMy only dissapointment was that there was not one party boy skitChris Pontious did not contribute as much as he did in the previous movie nor did Ryan Dunn but who actually laughs at Dunn  Bam had some good parts especially fooling with ape the fat boy switch lolIf you liked the first movie you will love this one if you dont  like it better than there is something wrong with youYou thought that they where out of ideas well this one was full of new ones,5,Better than the first movie,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,1049,"['Alright', 'usually', 'second', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'better', 'first', 'exception', 'movie', 'first', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', 'guarenteed', 'laugh', 'not', 'almost', 'scene', 'did', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', 'saw', 'first', 'one', 'laughed', 'dont', 'remember', 'laughing', 'as', 'hard', 'many', 'scenes.In', 'movie', 'do', 'lot', 'scenes', 'old', 'people', 'costume', 'gig', 'thingy', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'scenes', 'preston', 'lacy', 'wee-man', 'normal', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'star', 'did', 'first', 'movie', 'doing', 'more', 'crude', 'painfull', 'thingsMy', 'only', 'dissapointment', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'party', 'boy', 'skitChris', 'Pontious', 'did', 'not', 'contribute', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'previous', 'movie', 'did', 'Ryan', 'Dunn', 'who', 'actually', 'Dunn', 'Bam', 'had', 'good', 'parts', 'especially', 'fooling', 'ape', 'fat', 'boy', 'switch', 'lolIf', 'liked', 'first', 'movie', 'will', 'love', 'one', 'dont', 'better', 'something', 'wrong', 'youYou', 'thought', 'where', 'ideas', 'well', 'one', 'was', 'full', 'new', 'ones']",N/A

You will believe a man can eat feces and drink horse cum here. The extras are well-stocked featuring a party commentary and a lot of footage not included in the theatrical release.
