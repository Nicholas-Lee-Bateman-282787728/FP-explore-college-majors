I have to say that the beginning was slow and stopped watching it weeks before because I didn't think it was going to be any good. But today for some reason I was compelled to watch. And boy, am I glad I did.For some this movie may seem a bit slow, but you have to just sit back and relax and let it seep into your soul. About real people and real events that happen to them on a lonely Christmas Eve. it shows just how significant each and every one of us are, even if we do not believe it ourselves. Lefty is the prime example because he thinks that he is no good since he was a child, and keeps the nickname with him into adulthood.But Lefty is wrong. He finds out along with the rest of the characters in the movie that they are a very important part in the human race, just by being themselves. Hats off to Stephen Baldwin. I did not know who he was at first but thought, hey I've seen him before. Great job acting from whole cast.

This movie brilliantly portrays that sadness and loneliness in a very realistic and believable way.  So who wants to watch a depressing Christmas movie?  The hopelessness and lack of joy turns into hope and joy when people do the right thing and do little random acts of kindness, even when it doesn't seem like it makes any difference.  Amazingly both in this movie and in real life, just a little kindness often goes a long way to change hardened hearts and sad, lonely people.  The movie works because it truly demonstrates that there is still a lot of hope, even for those who seem to lost all hope.  Superb casting, especially Stephen Baldwin.  Truly uplifting, even though not a bright and cheery movie.  I got a lump in my throat at the end.  It's not a dramatic ending; just a quiet and pleasant ending.  Sometimes it is nice to have everything all wrapped up in a nice pleasant package at the end of a movie.  You won't get there here, but the movie wouldn't work well if it was done that way.  Instead, you just kind of instinctively know that the people who had lost their way, are going to be okay now.

I wish they made more movies like this!Simply told, and beautifully understated.  A wonderfully told tale about five strangers whose paths cross one Christmas Eve and impact one another's lives in sometimes simple, yet rather astounding ways.Not your usual Hollywood-type Christmas film where everyone is smiling and a happy ending can be found around every corner.  No, this film is about real people, with real problems, in the real world, where things don't always necessarily end happily ever after.  And, during the course of the film, we're never quite sure just what the outcome is going to be.Honest, sincere, real, totally believeable.  I could readily and easily identify with each and every character.  The performances are top-notch and are played to perfection.  Every performance comes across as being completely genuine.I love the look and feel to this movie.  Visually stunning, it's hard to believe this was shot on such a low budget and in something like only 18 days!Touching and deeply moving! The movie never feels forced or manipulative.

That's all I'll reveal about the storyline, though, as part of the beauty of this movie is seeing how its pieces come together.  Midnight Clear is about huge things (existence, relationship) and the small (a smile, a song)--at the same time, even the hugeness of the small.  It's heavy, yet full of hope.

But what is not expected for those viewers able to overcome the above negative aspects is a well-made little series of interlocking vignettes that poignantly address the impact of random acts of kindness in a world grown calloused.  It is touching in the best sense of the word and well worth watching even beyond the Christmas season.The unnamed town gradually opens windows to some fairly sad people: an elderly woman Eva (K Callan) talks with her doctor on the telephone about her meds and we note that she may be facing the thought of suicide in her desolate life; a sweet woman Mary (Mary Thornton) and her young son Jacob (Dominic Scott Kay) visit their brain damaged husband/father in a rest home (the man was critically injured in an auto accident one year ago); a lonely many Kirk (Kirk B.R. Woller) stands in his isolated convenience store without patrons; a longtime drunk and lonely ex-husband Lefty (Stephen Baldwin) is fired from his menial job, despite a recent promotion, because of his consistent tardiness; Mitch (Mitchell Jarvis) works with kids for a church to assuage his guilt for having survived the auto accident that devastated Mar's husband's life, reluctantly agreeing to his pastor (Richard Fancy) to take his youth group caroling to the shut-ins on Christmas Eve.Each of these characters influences the others by a seeming random act of kindness: Kirk helps Mary and Jacob with their broken car, Eva is given a meals on wheels by a church lady (Victoria Jackson), Mitch and his carolers provide some needed money by means of a token gift that will allow Lefty and Eva to attend Christmas Eve Service, and Eva's 'meals on wheels' ends up providing midnight food for Kirk and Mary and Jacob. Writer Wes Halula and director Dallas Jenkins carve a story that, though at times suggests it may become cloying, is genuinely touching. The cast, especially Baldwin and Callan, is excellent, and each of the characters is well developed, leaving the viewer with a sense of a morality tale we sorely need.  Instead of a big booming Hollywood finish, the film simply tapers off with suggestions of the importance of selfless acts that can make a difference.  It is well worth watching, especially now, and especially during the Christmas season.

Multiple vignettes combine to deliver an a sweet emotional impact. The cast, headed by Stephen Baldwin, all deliver first rate wonderful performances in this bleak though hopeful Christmas tale.

Each is touched by some random, some deliberate acts of kindness and each finds themselves transformed in unexpected ways.

950132,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000BU76YC,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 3]","""Midnight Clear"" is a first feature by director Dallas Jenkins.  It is an excellent piece about human relationships and personal isolation.  Stephen Baldwin who was in ""Fred Claus"" has the lead.  As the loser Lefty who has lost his family, his job & his home, he consoles himself with a bottle and thinks about ending it with a gun.  Baldwin's performance is tightly controlled.  It's so underplayed that it almost fails to appear.  In the DVD extra, director Jenkins seems a bit star struck with an actor with as many credits as Baldwin; but it seems that Baldwin perhaps was a victim of lack of direction in the part.  The rest of the supporting players are marvelous.  Faline England plays Lefty's wife Heather in a couple brief cameos.  Perhaps the strongest performance is by K Callan who appears to be doing her first work in 10 years in the film.  Her first film was 1970's ""Joe"" followed by many credits including 1979's ""The Onion Field.""  As Lefty's mother Eva, she is losing her health & her memory while her family has abandoned her.  Her transformation when Lefty arrives on her doorstep is endearing.  Victoria Jackson from TV's ""Saturday Night Live"" from 1986-1992 cameos as the meals on wheels lady who brings Eva food.  Mary Thornton who was in an independent film titled ""Solitude"" in 2002 does an excellent job as Mary, a woman whose husband has suffered brain damage from a car accident, and who finds herself stranded at a filling station on New Year's Eve.  Thornton's performance is incredibly layered as she works with grief, attempted bravery, and loneliness.  Her son Jacob is played well by Dominic Scott Key who was in ""Minority Report.""  They wind up at Mr. K's filling station played by Kirk B.R. Woller who was in Clint Eastwood'sFlags of Our Fathers (Widescreen Edition)and 2003's version of ""The Hulk.""  Playing a character named Kirk, Woller shows amazing sensitivity, loneliness and the ability to love when he helps Mary with her car on this Christmas Eve night.  It's another stunning performance in the film.  Mitchell Jarvis -- in the only film credit I could find for him -- plays the youth pastor Mitch who was Mary's husband's best friend and mourns his loss.  Jarvis does an excellent job with the doubts that he can effectively serve God as he takes kids out for some passionless Christmas caroling.  Richard Fancy who was inShopgirland ""Being John Malcovich"" plays the pastor Mark who keeps encouraging his young youth pastor.  The film concludes appropriately for me as people show up in church searching for hope and finding it by being needed by others.

950138,AQ2UN38CMK119,B000BU76YC,P. Mann,"[5, 5]","According to the commentary on this film, Jerry B. Jenkins, he ofLeft Behindfame and the father of director Dallas Jenkins, got the idea for a short story when he read a statistic that the number of suicides is higher at Christmas than at any other time of the year. That statistic is false, according to Snopes, but there are, of course, people who are depressed at Christmastime. This film is about some of those people.Stephen Baldwin, in a superbly understated performance, plays Lefty, a down-on-his-luck man who loses his job on the morning of Christmas Eve. Living in his car, having trouble with visitation rights for his children, he wanders about somewhat aimlessly, and depression oozes from his performance in a way that seems completely real. He is, we soon learn, a man who has reached the bottom. His story is not the only one, though.K Callan plays Eva, an elderly woman, is preparing to end her life. Her family has abandoned her, and she is getting what few affairs she has in order: putting out an entire bag of cat food for (apparently) a stray cat, closing out her checking account (with less than $10 in it), and so forth. Kirk B.R. Woller plays a man who owns a convenience store and opens on Christmas Eve because the competitors in the area are closed. When his few customers wish him a merry Christmas, he responds, ""Yep."" Then there is Mary Thornton Brown's character, Mary, a mother of a young boy. Her husband has been hospitalized after an accident and is suffering mental and emotional issues that make him essentially inaccessible to her. Finally, there is the young pastor who seems to be questioning his effectiveness with the youth group, which goes through the motioning of caroling for elderly parishioners who seem to have no interest in attending the Christmas Eve service. These characters' lives overlap as their stories intertwine.As a Christmas film, ""Midnight Clear"" (based, parenthetically, on a short film with the same title) is different from most. If you add the number of scenes at a mall, the number of mentions of Santa, and the number of young, attractive people who realize they've been in love with each other for a while, you get 0. Nor, somewhat surprisingly to me, is there any preaching. Given the provenance of this film, I expected a tendentious film. That's not at all what I got. ""Midnight Clear"" is instead a compelling character study with superb acting all around. It is a moving story about the importance of simple human connections.
