1388263,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0047BXR1C,calvinnme,"[7, 13]","First an explanation of my rating. Are these movies great ones with Jean Harlow's talent prominently exhibited - of course, so five stars for that. Is this simply a rehash of material that has been available on DVD for over five years in an attempt to cash in on Jean Harlow's birthday - absolutely, so one star for that. I average to get three stars.Jean Harlow spent the lion's share of her career at MGM so Warner Home Video has control of virtually her entire filmography save a few Columbias she did early on. What WHV controls that is not on pressed DVD includes (In reverse chronological order):Saratoga - Good but heartbreaking because Harlow died during filming and you can very easily tell where a double takes over, always shot from behind.Personal Property - An OK remake of the superior precode ""Man in Possession""Suzy - If you liked Hell's Angels you'll love this one.Riffraff - Almost precode in content, a story of a rocky cannery row marriage.Reckless - MGM used Harlow's personal troubles as a plot.The Girl from Missouri - You can almost see the demarcation line of the precode era running down the middle of this story of a girl in search of a marriageable millionaire.Bombshell - The best of what is not out on DVD yet. Harlow parodies herself.Hold Your Man - Practically two different movies. The first half is brassy, the second half sentimental. Some don't like it but I loved it.Red Dust - The plot is merely a framework for some great precode moments.The Beast of the City - On DVD-R via Warner Archives. It deserves more respect than that fate.The Secret Six - Harlow's first appearance in a credited role for MGM. She doesn't do much here but what she does is done well. Strangely enough, never shown on TCM any more.I have no problem with the TCM greatest films franchise as far as bringing cheap collections of classic films to the masses, but Harlow still has plenty of fans since her humor and brassiness are timeless. If WHV thinks a boxed set of pressed DVDs of her yet unreleased films would not sell well on the 100th anniversary of her birth, they need to have their collective heads examined. More than likely their heads are fine though. The films I mention above are probably all destined for the Warner Archive where you can count on over-priced pixelated DVD-R's that randomly freeze made with loving care by a ten buck an hour employee who is just waiting for the recession to end to trade jobs.",3,How to make money without even trying...at all,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,2438,"['First', 'explanation', 'rating', 'Are', 'movies', 'great', 'ones', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'talent', 'prominently', 'exhibited', 'course', 'so', 'five', 'stars', 'simply', 'rehash', 'material', 'been', 'available', 'DVD', 'five', 'years', 'attempt', 'cash', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'birthday', 'absolutely', 'one', 'star', 'average', 'get', 'three', 'stars.Jean', 'Harlow', 'spent', 'lion', 'share', 'career', 'MGM', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'control', 'virtually', 'entire', 'filmography', 'save', 'few', 'Columbias', 'did', 'early', 'What', 'WHV', 'not', 'pressed', 'DVD', 'reverse', 'chronological', 'order', 'Saratoga', 'Good', 'heartbreaking', 'Harlow', 'died', 'filming', 'can', 'very', 'easily', 'tell', 'where', 'double', 'always', 'shot', 'behind.Personal', 'Property', 'OK', 'remake', 'superior', 'precode', 'Man', 'Possession', 'Suzy', 'liked', 'Hell', 'Angels', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one.Riffraff', 'Almost', 'precode', 'content', 'story', 'rocky', 'cannery', 'row', 'marriage.Reckless', 'MGM', 'used', 'Harlow', 'personal', 'troubles', 'plot.The', 'Girl', 'Missouri', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'demarcation', 'line', 'precode', 'era', 'running', 'down', 'middle', 'story', 'girl', 'search', 'marriageable', 'millionaire.Bombshell', 'best', 'what', 'not', 'out', 'DVD', 'yet', 'Harlow', 'parodies', 'herself.Hold', 'Man', 'Practically', 'two', 'different', 'movies', 'first', 'half', 'brassy', 'second', 'half', 'sentimental', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'loved', 'it.Red', 'Dust', 'plot', 'merely', 'framework', 'great', 'precode', 'moments.The', 'Beast', 'City', 'DVD-R', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'more', 'respect', 'fate.The', 'Secret', 'Six', 'Harlow', 'first', 'appearance', 'credited', 'role', 'MGM', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'here', 'what', 'done', 'well', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'never', 'shown', 'TCM', 'more.I', 'have', 'problem', 'TCM', 'greatest', 'films', 'franchise', 'as', 'far', 'bringing', 'cheap', 'collections', 'classic', 'films', 'masses', 'Harlow', 'still', 'plenty', 'fans', 'humor', 'brassiness', 'are', 'timeless', 'WHV', 'boxed', 'set', 'pressed', 'DVDs', 'yet', 'unreleased', 'films', 'would', 'not', 'sell', 'well', '100th', 'anniversary', 'birth', 'need', 'have', 'collective', 'heads', 'examined', 'More', 'likely', 'heads', 'are', 'fine', 'films', 'mention', 'are', 'probably', 'destined', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'where', 'can', 'count', 'over-priced', 'pixelated', 'DVD-R', 'randomly', 'freeze', 'made', 'loving', 'care', 'ten', 'buck', 'hour', 'employee', 'who', 'just', 'waiting', 'recession', 'end', 'trade', 'jobs']",TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Legends - Jean Harlow (Dinner at Eight / Libeled Lady / China Seas / Wife vs. Secretary)

For someone who doesn't have the films/dvds included in this set, it is a great deal and is a Jean Harlow primer for the uniformed. For the die-hard Harlow fan (and there are many out there) this falls a bit short.My issue with this set is given that it is so long overdue, it would have been nice if it had been a truly comprehensive set with special features and films that are not currently available on dvd. It should be quintessential Harlow with films such as Suzy, Girl From Missouri, Platinum Blonde, Red Dust, Riffraff and my absolute personal favorite Red Headed Woman(already on dvd in the Forbidden Hollywood set).Harlow was the original Hollywood blonde and had such an innate gift for comedy that this set while good, certainly isn't as good as it might have been. My major concern is that while she has now been given her own 'collection' will her fans have to wait years to see more titles released? I certainly hope not.

1388270,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B0047BXR1C,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","""TCM Greatest Classic Legends: Jean Harlow"" is a good collection for the fans of Jean Harlow (who most likely already own this) and for those that like classic Hollywood cinema. Four of Harlow's most enduring film's are included here - ""Dinner at Eight""  (1933), ""China Seas"" (1935), ""Wife vs. Secretary"" (1936) and ""Libeled Lady"" (1936). Most are light, charming comedies, with the exception of ""Wife vs. Secretary"" which is a drama and Harlow shines in all of them. My personal favorites presented here are ""Dinner at Eight"" and the highly enjoyable ""China Seas"" which pairs her again with the macho Clark Gable, who co-starred with her inThe Secret Six(1931),Red Dust(1932),Hold Your Man(1933)"", ""Wife vs. Secretary"" (1936) and Harlow's last pictureSaratoga(1937).In ""Dinner at Eight"" ****, Jean Harlow plays a secondary character however her performance here is a scene stealer and this is saying a lot because she is surrounded by veteran actors - Marie Dressler (who at a time in the 30's was the biggest box office draw), John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery, Billie Burke. Harlow plays Kitty Packard, the gold-digging wife of Dan Packard (Beery), a shady businessman who have been invited to attend a society dinner hosted by the wealthy Mr & Mrs. Oliver Jordan (Lionel Barrymore and Billie Burke). When comparing Harlow's performance in this picture to her earlier screen performances, it is incredible how much her acting improved. Her performance here is hilarious but most importantly very accomplished. Despite Kitty's harsh character flaws, Harlow makes her likeable, almost lovable and her delivery here is flawless. She delivers her spoken dialogue fast and furious and gives her gold-digger added charm and wit. Her argument with Beery is one of the film's highlights as is the closing scene, in which she and Dressler have a hilarious exchange. This is one of my favorite Harlow performances.""China Seas"" **** (1935) is another favorite of mine. Here Harlow is cast alongside her usual co-star, Clark Cable. The film is set on a ship sailing from Hong Kong to Singapore. Harlow plays Dolly, referred to in the film as China Doll, who has a tumultuous on/off relationship with Alan Gaskell (Gable), the ship's captain. The 2 are clearly attracted to each other but their constant bickering gets in the way of developing a serious relationship. Things get further complicated when the beautiful and sophisticated Sybil Barclay (Rosalind Russell) boards the ship. Again, Harlow shines in this film. Looking fine and radiant, her comedic flair is evident and whenever Harlow is on the screen, you have a hard time taking your eyes off her as her platinum silhouette cuts a fine and striking figure. The film is also very entertaining, combining comedy, drama and action sequences. Although not the best out of Harlow's film catalogue, this is definitely one of the most entertaining.""Wife vs. Secretary"" *** (1936) is a drama and stars Harlow, Clark Gable and Myna Loy. Although this is not on my list of favorite Harlow films, many of her fans love this movie. I agree that Harlow is good here. A total opposite of her earlier roles and no longer a brassy, platinum, loud mouth bombshell, she is more subdued and a lot less flashy. Her hair is much darker, and she resonates a more innocent beauty. Her performance is good, although the story itself, about a misunderstanding between a husband and wife, and the innocent secretary caught between it, does not a 90 minute movie make. However, it is still an opportunity to see several well respected actors from a by-gone era in action. The cast also stars a young Jimmy Stewart.""Libeled Lady"" *** 1/2 (1936) is a screw-ball comedy with a great cast that includes William Powell, Spencer Tracy and Myrna Loy. This film is held in high regard by most critics and Harlow fans and it was nominated for an Academy Award for ""Best Picture"" but like `Wife vs. Secretary"" it is not my favorite Harlow vehicle. Although I cannot deny its charms and the performances are great, for me, the characters, with the exception of probably Harlow's Gladys Benton, all seem pretty shallow, conniving and a bit too childish. The story deals with a lawsuit filed by Connie Allenbury (Loy) for $5 million against a newspaper for falsely claiming that she had broken up a marriage. The newspaper's managing editor, Warren Haggarty (Tracy) concocts a crazy scheme in order to save the newspaper and enlists the aid of Bill Chandler (Powell), an alleged ladies man, who is to seduce Connie and have the scene witnessed by Chandler's unsuspecting wife, Gladys (Harlow) in order to humiliate this libeled lady so she would drop the lawsuit. Gladys is actually engaged to Haggarty and only agreed to be part of the wild scheme by the desperate pleadings of her fianc&eacute;. The film does offer some amusing and funny scenes and again, is a change in tone for Harlow, who at this point in her career, moved on from playing platinum bad girl's to more respectable roles and managed to pull them off successfully. After this film, Harlow would star in 2 more pictures, ""Personal Property"" (1937) and ""Saratoga"" (1937) before her premature death at the age of 26.The movies are presented in 2 double sided DVD's (which I am not a fan of since I always have an issue trying to figure out - is it side up or side down? .. to view a specific picture) and there are some extras included in each such as the theatrical trailers. The ""Dinner at Eight"" DVD has some interesting bonus features, most notably a documentary on the life of Jean Harlow titled ""Harlow: The Blonde Bombshell"" and narrated by Sharon Stone. This documentary was originally released in the early 90's and I have an old VHS version somewhere in my vaults and it's great to have it here. It is interesting, with numerous photographs and film clips of Harlow's career and it is very respectful to her memory. In regards to the the picture quality of the movies, it is not as good as I would have hoped. I did notice several unsightly scratches when viewing ""Dinner at Eight"" so I wished they would have cleaned the films up a bit more.This set is a good introduction to the enduring actress who is known as the original blonde bombshell. Those who are left wanting more, most of Jean Harlow's other films have been released on DVD and the box setJean Harlow 100th Anniversary Collection (Bombshell / The Girl from Missouri / Reckless / Riffraff / Suzy / Personal Property / Saratoga)is another worthy purchase. Although incomplete (it only comes with 7 of her movies), it gives you a glimpse of the talents and charms of one of the silver screens earliest sex symbols and those films, along with the 4 presented here, is a great showcase of her talents and shows her evolution as an actress and comedienne.

1388273,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,B0047BXR1C,Jeff  Farrow,"[6, 7]","The fact that this Harlow collection was manufactured by TCM guarantees quality of the product. TCM has spearheaded the early film restoration project that has salvaged many of the great movies from the wages of time & neglect. Since other reviewers discuss the individual films (I give each one a 5 star rating), I just want to take this opportunity to set the record straight on a remark I made in another review of a Harlow movie.In that review I said something to the effect that maybe Harlow couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, but who cares? She was just too adorable & lovely. Since then I've seen other Harlow movies & discovered something: When she wasn't playing a vamp and just an ""ordinary"" woman...she was damned good! Very natural, very competent. Up to this point I had only seen her in ""shady lady"" type roles.Please don't misunderstand, I loved her in the vampy roles too, and part of the fun was that she did seem to go way over the top & overact. Now I realize that she WAS an ""ordinary"" woman (who happened to be stunningly attractive) and the vamp roles were wildly out of character--hence the tendency to overact. She was playing a part that was nothing like her true self. The overacting was funny & I think it allowed people--like yours truly--to identify even more with her.In this regard she was very much like Marilyn Monroe (who was probably inspired by the Harlow Plantimun Bombshell legacy.) Both actresses were real photogenic Aphrodites, but their little foibles allowed people to see them as being just like ""real"" people. Women loved them as much as men--and this was a real secret to their success. If they had been as perfect as they looked, they would have inspired envy in other women, not adulation. It allowed the fantasy that female fans could really be like them too. Jean Harlow had the added attraction of being completely down to earth. She enjoyed hanging out with the stage crew & treated everybody with honest sincerity. Yes, I am a fan!If you enjoy 30's movies, you can't go wrong with this collection.PS. Another example of this ""identification principle"" was Roseanne Barr-Arnold-Whatever. When she was...plump...and before all the cosmetic surgery, she was a hoot. But when she slimmed down & started to look generic...not so funny anymore.",5,I ADORE Jean Harlow...and these are great films,1305763200,"05 19, 2011",2011,2297,"['fact', 'Harlow', 'collection', 'was', 'manufactured', 'TCM', 'guarantees', 'quality', 'product', 'TCM', 'spearheaded', 'early', 'film', 'restoration', 'project', 'salvaged', 'many', 'great', 'movies', 'wages', 'time', 'neglect', 'other', 'reviewers', 'discuss', 'individual', 'films', 'give', 'one', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'just', 'want', 'take', 'opportunity', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'remark', 'made', 'review', 'Harlow', 'movie.In', 'review', 'said', 'something', 'effect', 'maybe', 'Harlow', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'adorable', 'lovely', 'then', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'Harlow', 'movies', 'discovered', 'something', 'When', 'was', ""n't"", 'playing', 'vamp', 'just', 'ordinary', 'woman', 'was', 'damned', 'good', 'Very', 'natural', 'very', 'competent', 'Up', 'point', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'shady', 'lady', 'type', 'roles.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'loved', 'vampy', 'roles', 'too', 'part', 'fun', 'was', 'did', 'seem', 'go', 'way', 'top', 'overact', 'Now', 'realize', 'WAS', 'ordinary', 'woman', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'stunningly', 'attractive', 'vamp', 'roles', 'were', 'wildly', 'character', 'hence', 'tendency', 'overact', 'was', 'playing', 'part', 'was', 'nothing', 'true', 'self', 'overacting', 'was', 'funny', 'think', 'allowed', 'people', 'yours', 'truly', 'identify', 'even', 'more', 'regard', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'who', 'was', 'probably', 'inspired', 'Harlow', 'Plantimun', 'Bombshell', 'legacy', 'actresses', 'were', 'real', 'photogenic', 'Aphrodites', 'little', 'foibles', 'allowed', 'people', 'see', 'being', 'just', 'real', 'people', 'Women', 'loved', 'as', 'much', 'men', 'was', 'real', 'secret', 'success', 'had', 'been', 'as', 'perfect', 'looked', 'would', 'have', 'inspired', 'envy', 'other', 'women', 'not', 'adulation', 'allowed', 'fantasy', 'female', 'fans', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'too', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'had', 'added', 'attraction', 'being', 'completely', 'earth', 'enjoyed', 'hanging', 'out', 'stage', 'crew', 'treated', 'everybody', 'honest', 'sincerity', 'Yes', 'am', 'fan', 'enjoy', '30', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'collection.PS', 'example', 'identification', 'principle', 'was', 'Roseanne', 'Barr-Arnold-Whatever', 'When', 'was', 'plump', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'was', 'hoot', 'when', 'slimmed', 'down', 'started', 'look', 'generic', 'not', 'so', 'funny', 'anymore']",TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Legends - Jean Harlow (Dinner at Eight / Libeled Lady / China Seas / Wife vs. Secretary)

This is a wonderful introduction to one of the movies' greatest stars and pioneering sex symbols, as well as one of the best comediennes of alltime.  The bad news is ALL FOUR of these movies are already available on DVD when there's well over a dozen other Harlow movies sitting in the MGM vaults that badly need to be released!!  Jean had major roles in about 23 films before her tragic death at age 26 in 1937 yet only these, RED HEADED WOMAN (in a pre-code set), Universal's HELL'S ANGELS, WB's THE PUBLIC ENEMY, and Columbia's PLATINUM BLONDE have been commercially released on DVD to date!! That's a major disgrace, she's perhaps the biggest movie star of all who has been so poorly represented on dvd.And what a slap in the face to Harlow fans who have kept this star's flame alive for over 70 years - March 2011 will be the 100th anniversary of Jean Harlow's birth.  Some birthday present!!!  Shame on you Warner Bros. (who now has the rights to the vintage MGMs) when it comes to Jean Harlow you are almost as bad as the notorious Universal handling of the vintage Paramount catalog!If you have never seen Jean Harlow in action and want to know what all the fuss is about, by all means grab this collection.  DINNER AT EIGHT is perhaps Jean's most legendary film and her comic barbs are as delicious as the bon bons she munches on.  Equally delightful is the comedy LIBELED LADY which was nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award in 1936.  CHINA SEAS is a roaring comedy/adventure on the high seas with Jean's greatest leading man Clark Gable;  WIFE VS. SECRETARY offers Harlow, Gable, and Myrna Loy too in a pleasant little lowkey ""women's picture"" drama whose title tells all.  This movie is particularly admired by many Harlow buffs for her successful casting against type as the gentle, quiet secretary who fights her feelings for boss Gable.Much as Harlowheads resent WB's lame offering for a ""first"" Harlow DVD set I suggest buying it, especially if you don't have any of these wonderful movies.  Maybe if it sells through the roof it will knock some sense into their heads and Jean Harlow will then get the deluxe boxed set a star of her legendary status truly deserves.",5,Harlow 101 - Nice Intro to the Movie Legend But Disappointing for True Fans,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,2321,"[""'m"", 'giving', 'set', 'qualified', 'five', 'stars', 'movies', 'are', 'wonderful', 'course', 'star', 'legendary', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'wonderful', 'introduction', 'one', 'movies', 'greatest', 'stars', 'pioneering', 'sex', 'symbols', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'best', 'comediennes', 'alltime', 'bad', 'news', 'FOUR', 'movies', 'are', 'already', 'available', 'DVD', 'when', 'well', 'dozen', 'other', 'Harlow', 'movies', 'sitting', 'MGM', 'vaults', 'badly', 'need', 'be', 'released', 'Jean', 'had', 'major', 'roles', 'about', '23', 'films', 'tragic', 'death', 'age', '26', '1937', 'yet', 'only', 'RED', 'HEADED', 'WOMAN', 'pre-code', 'set', 'Universal', 'HELL', 'ANGELS', 'WB', 'THE', 'PUBLIC', 'ENEMY', 'Columbia', 'PLATINUM', 'BLONDE', 'have', 'been', 'commercially', 'released', 'DVD', 'date', 'major', 'disgrace', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'been', 'so', 'poorly', 'represented', 'dvd.And', 'what', 'slap', 'face', 'Harlow', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'kept', 'star', 'flame', 'alive', '70', 'years', 'March', '2011', 'will', 'be', '100th', 'anniversary', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'birth', 'birthday', 'present', 'Shame', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'who', 'now', 'rights', 'vintage', 'MGMs', 'when', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'are', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'notorious', 'Universal', 'handling', 'vintage', 'Paramount', 'catalog', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'action', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'fuss', 'means', 'grab', 'collection', 'DINNER', 'AT', 'EIGHT', 'perhaps', 'Jean', 'most', 'legendary', 'film', 'comic', 'barbs', 'are', 'as', 'delicious', 'bon', 'bons', 'Equally', 'delightful', 'comedy', 'LIBELED', 'LADY', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Award', '1936', 'CHINA', 'SEAS', 'roaring', 'comedy/adventure', 'high', 'seas', 'Jean', 'greatest', 'leading', 'man', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'WIFE', 'VS.', 'SECRETARY', 'offers', 'Harlow', 'Gable', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'too', 'pleasant', 'little', 'lowkey', 'women', 'picture', 'drama', 'title', 'movie', 'particularly', 'admired', 'many', 'Harlow', 'buffs', 'successful', 'casting', 'type', 'gentle', 'quiet', 'secretary', 'who', 'feelings', 'boss', 'Gable.Much', 'Harlowheads', 'resent', 'WB', 'lame', 'offering', 'first', 'Harlow', 'DVD', 'set', 'suggest', 'buying', 'especially', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wonderful', 'movies', 'Maybe', 'roof', 'will', 'knock', 'sense', 'heads', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'will', 'then', 'get', 'deluxe', 'boxed', 'set', 'star', 'legendary', 'status', 'truly', 'deserves']",TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Legends - Jean Harlow (Dinner at Eight / Libeled Lady / China Seas / Wife vs. Secretary)
1388286,A65XH6L5BUX0X,B0047BXR1C,"TheClassicsNut65 ""morgan miller""","[0, 0]","Jean Harlow was by far one of the most-popular actresses during the 1930s. As a contract star for MGM, Miss Harlow's films more often than not made more money than those of her fellow MGM actresses, including such luminaries as Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Luise Rainer, and Norma Shearer. Jean Harlow was truly the first Blonde Bombshell of the silver screen. Some say it was Mae West, but it's not true. Jean was on the movie scene big time in 1930 with Hell's Angels, but Mae didn't make her movie debut until 1932's Night After Night.This TCM Greatest Classic Legends collection does its best to showcase Jean Harlow with what little budget it seems it had. Like the others sets that have been released showcasing such stars as Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Ronald Reagan, Doris Day, Katharine Hepburn, etc. this set is very simple. There are two DVDs with two movies on each disc. Unlike the other TCM releases, each movie does not have its own DVD.Personally, I think TCM did a good job picking out which four movies of Harlow to include. With such stars of Harlow's status, it is sometimes hard to choose which films get put in a collection and which ones don't. My break down of the films follows hereafter.The earliest film included in this collection is Dinner at Eight (1933), a dramatization (with comedic elements) of upper class life in the 1930s. It was one of the first &#34;all-star&#34; films Hollywood produced, the first being Grand Hotel (1932) also distributed my MGM. Jean is not the central star in Dinner at Eight, but she certainly makes it worth watching. As Kitty Packard, Harlow characterizes an ungrateful wife to Dan Packard, played by Wallace Beery, who's cheating on him with Dr. Wayne Talbot, played by Edmund Lowe. The film features several other well-known stars of the era, such as Marie Dressler, John and Lionel Barrymore, Billie Burke, Lee Tracy, and Jean Hersholt. Had these great performers not been in this film, it would have been far less appealing. This is certainly a must-see of Harlow's, even though she's not the headliner.Next we have China Seas (1935), which was Harlow's fourth pairing with Clark Gable. This film fits the genre of comedy-drama, with almost equal aspects of both. Harlow plays China Doll, a woman seeking the affection of Clark Gable's character, who's the captain of an ocean liner they're all on, but he's actually in love with Rosalind Russell's character. Wallace Beery ads to the drama by trying to win Harlow from Gable, but in the end, looses her when his dirty dealings surface. This could not be said as being the &#34;best&#34; Harlow-Gable pairing (that award goes to Red Dust and Saratoga), but its definitely worth a viewing or two.Wife vs. Secretary (1936) is next in line, another Harlow-Gable starring vehicle with Myrna Loy and a young James Stewart along for the ride. This time Harlow is Gable's secretary, Whitey Wilson, while Gable as Van Stanhope is happily married to Myrna Loy as his lovely wife Linda. May Robson co-stars as Mimi, Van's mother, who tries to convince Linda Van is having an affair with Whitey. The film's humor comes from the growing jealousy of Myrna Loy, fearing her husband, Gable, is indeed having an affair with Whitey. It's not true, however. The relationship between Whitey and Van is strictly business. This is another, very humorous Harlow-Gable pairing that is enjoyable time and time again. Cheers to Myrna Loy as well, who made the film even better.Lastly, we have Libeled Lady (1936), Jean's second-to-last fully completed film. This is an overjoying screwball comedy. In this setup, Jean is fakes a marriage to William Powell, though she's truly in love with Spencer Tracy. Powell is indeed in love with Myrna Loy. There's lots of twists and turns in this comedic gem and it keeps you smiling and entertained all the way through. It's undoubtedly one of Jean's better films and proved to be one of her most successful. Libeled Lady was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, but lost to The Great Ziegfeld.In all, this TCM collection of four Jean Harlow flicks are entertaining. It's hard to compare one to the other, but its likable that Wife vs. Secretary and Libeled Lady could compete for best comedy. It's equally hard to rate these films on a scale of 1 to 10, but I'd try if asked. Libeled Lady is probably the best of the batch.My List (scale 1&#9472;10)1) Libeled Lady: 9.82) Dinner at Eight: 9.43) China Seas: 9.24) Wife vs. Secretary: 9.1Yes, I gave all four of these films a rating over 9. They each deserve it. They're that entertaining, compelling, classic. All of the above. The Jean Harlow 100th Anniversary Collection is perhaps better, because it contains seven films, all equally interesting and classical. This is a cheaper, yet impressive and appreciative. This a good set. Not a great one. It's one to have to let you know who and what Jean Harlow was and how there is nothing else like her... EVER! Buy it for yourself and find out on your own.",4,The first Jean Harlow Collection,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,5006,"['Jean', 'Harlow', 'was', 'far', 'one', 'most-popular', 'actresses', '1930s',
