That gave me a good window into this series, as it is very different from the lightheartedness of the ""Anne of Green Gables"" series and the ""Road to Avonlea"" series (both of which are worth owning). The characters in ""Emily"" are much more complicated than in the other series. But this is SO WORTH seeing! My only grief is that the producer didn't go further in terms of finishing out the DVD series by following the original novels. I do have one criticism: Whoever produced this series screwed up on the numbering of the DVDs. This means that you have to go through all seven DVDs and figure out the order they belong in, by following the episode titles given on the back of the DVD case. (I marked them as 1.1, 1.2, etc. with a permanent marker and put them into the case in the correct order.)

1337970,A1FPP34DESLHGQ,B003EJO8QQ,Irish Gal,"[2, 13]","I gave this a 2 star. When I first began watching this show, I thought it would be a cute show for children and encouraged my daughter to have my two small granddaughters to view it. Well, after a few episodes I began to think everything was a sham. Emily was a daydreamer, with an excessive imaginations. She was always seeing imaginary things as real. Emily involved herself into adult issues on a continual basis. Most children her age would be out playing with peers. True, she had Ilse as a friend along with Perry, but all those children seem to involve themselves in adult issues. Then when they delivered a baby from one of the Murray cousins who gave birth out of wedlock that very much appalled me. Having all those kids about delivering a baby. I just could not believe they would allow something like that on television for children to see and the woman giving birth was a jezebel. Well, it just was a horrible episode for any child to watch. Emily was too young to even think of being a writer. Yes, children dream about future goals, but during the show they over emphasized how Emily would become a writer when the girl was just learning how to spell and use proper grammar in elementary school which should have been focused upon firstly and then in late episodes them discussing her becoming a writer. I began to think the only people in the family with common sense were Uncle Malcolm and Aunt Elizabeth who at times could be exacerbating old witch. Nevertheless, Elizabeth stated in some episodes that Emily needs to not involve herself with adult affairs, which I agreed with. After all this show was to be setting examples for children. Then there is good old Perry that did not even know how to spell his name but kept on the issue of becoming Prime Minister someday when his family was nothing but thieves, liars, and his mother killing his father. These kids focused too much on their futures and not on the present such as their education and their childhood, which would be interacting with their peers and not adult issues. Ilse was a major snoop into everyone's business and didn't even take the time to wash her face. She looked like a filthy person and she was supposed to present herself as the town physician's daughter. Now how does that look to children watching the show? Ilse was a complete snob and I am sure they wanted her to behave this way in her character, but they over did it. Then to have Ilse raise that baby on her own was a circus. As I said, they put these children more in adult roles more than children's roles. After seeing this show I do not recommend it to anyone and especially children. I can now see why they show did not last long. What I thought was the most absurd was Emily seeing things that were not real/imaginary. This was a bad example for children to see in the show. My granddaughter went to bed with nightmares from these things that were not real. After my granddaughters nightmare we did not allow her to watch it again and she didn't want to watch it. She called it, `The scary show'.  It was a shame as this show was written more for children, but wasn't really meant for children to see. I have not read or viewed any of Ms. Montgomery's books/shows, but heard the rest are good such as `Anne of Green Gables'. Why they put Emily out I will never know because it was just that, it was scary as my granddaughter said. Aunt Laura was nice but was excessively nave, which bored me to tears. She could never stick up for herself in which I wish they would have allowed her to do and it would have made the show more interesting. I mentioned Uncle Malcolm and Aunt Elizabeth with having the common sense, but I must correct myself. The only one who had common sense in this show was Uncle Jimmy (Stephan McHattie). He played his role well and was smart. He had the most common sense of the entire clan. I am partial to Stephan McHattie. He has always been one of my favorite actors and he did a fine job in his role. Anyway, please use good judgment in letting your children watch this show. I don't recommend it to children.",2,Not good for children to watch.

Laura gets addicted to drugs and marries a philanderer? Newly created relatives show up and take over? etc, etc. I would much prefer that, if they had run out of ideas, that they had stopped right there.The idea of Emily seeing visions of these stories in vivid color is interesting, not that it's a favorite part of mine.

My grandmother grew up during this age and toldme many stories that reminded me when I watched the series. There are good times and extremely bad times,but this is a story of how it really was to live during this time, especially if you are a talented writerand want to be a great writer, living around people that see no future in a woman wanting to be a success.The scenes, especially the ocean and the island are fantastic! Did E M Montgomery struggle like Emily?I am so happy I have this series in my collection.",5,Emily Starr So Talented,1340323200,"06 22, 2012",2012,1109,"['What', 'great', 'story', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'late', '1890', 'First', 'all', 'wonderful', 'story', 'ofa', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'parents', 'forced', 'live', 'mean', 'aunt', 'other', 'gentlerelatives', 'series', 'junior', 'high', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'course', 'adults', 'Emilywants', 'desperately', 'be', 'writer', 'struggles', 'want', 'stop', 'her', 'dreams', 'actorsare', 'fantastic', 'especially', 'children', 'Emily', 'descended', 'Scots', 'inherited', 'second', 'sight', 'meaning', 'can', 'see', 'spirit', 'world', 'come', 'help', 'grandmother', 'grew', 'up', 'age', 'toldme', 'many', 'stories', 'reminded', 'when', 'watched', 'series', 'are', 'good', 'times', 'extremely', 'bad', 'times', 'story', 'how', 'really', 'was', 'live', 'time', 'especially', 'are', 'talented', 'writerand', 'want', 'be', 'great', 'writer', 'living', 'people', 'see', 'future', 'woman', 'wanting', 'be', 'success.The', 'scenes', 'especially', 'ocean', 'island', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Did', 'E', 'M', 'Montgomery', 'struggle', 'Emily', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'have', 'series', 'collection']",N/A
1337981,A2H0CPZOTGGFM6,B003EJO8QQ,Spain,"[0, 1]",This is a fun and entertaining series to watch and discuss as a family.  The characters are interesting and developed well.  My only complaint is with the DVDs for season three and four which are two-sided.  The last episodes on the second side do not play correctly.  The picture freezes up and jumps around while the audio continues uninterrupted.  This was a terrible disappointment.  Be sure to check your copy before you've had it too long to exchange.,5,Excellent family series.,1302652800,"04 13, 2011",2011,457,"['fun', 'entertaining', 'series', 'watch', 'discuss', 'family', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'developed', 'well', 'only', 'complaint', 'DVDs', 'season', 'three', 'four', 'are', 'two-sided', 'last', 'episodes', 'second', 'side', 'do', 'not', 'play', 'correctly', 'picture', 'up', 'jumps', 'audio', 'uninterrupted', 'was', 'terrible', 'disappointment', 'Be', 'sure', 'check', 'copy', ""'ve"", 'had', 'too', 'long', 'exchange']",N/A

The manufacturers did not have them all marked according to their order.  This mix-up made watching them confusing because you had to figure out what order they should be watched in order to understand the story.  The item was supposedly new so I don't know where the problem lies. I don't think it lies with Amazon.,5,Emily Review,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,444,"['quality', 'purchase', 'was', 'good', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'multi-discs', 'were', 'not', 'arranged', 'order', 'case', 'manufacturers', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'marked', 'according', 'order', 'mix-up', 'made', 'watching', 'confusing', 'had', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'order', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'order', 'understand', 'story', 'item', 'was', 'supposedly', 'new', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Amazon']",N/A
