1607939,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00AEK9BKQ,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Proof that there are all kinds of `true stories' to be told; `The Sessions' is a very different kind of biopic.  Telling the story of Mark O'Brien, `The Sessions' is a sweet hearted look at one man's struggle to lose his virginity.Mark is a paralyzed poet who spends most of his time in an iron lung and has limited communication with people outside of his helpers and his priest.  Mark eventually decides that he wants to have sexual relations with a woman and so, with the support from his priest he decides to contact a sex therapist.  That is when he meets Cheryl.  Cheryl is a middle aged woman who serves as a sex surrogate.  She'll give Mark six sessions where he can explore his sexuality with Cheryl and eventually have relations with her.  That will be his introduction to the world of sex, and from there he is on his own.  Being nervous and inexperienced, and being in a condition that isn't always accommodating, his first few sessions don't pan out as expected, but eventually he gets the hang of things.The great thing about `The Sessions' is that it really steers far away from being overtly sympathetic.  It never demands that we mourn over Mark's condition.  Instead, we celebrate his freedoms and the way that he handles his predicament, never making it a sore spot or allowing it to hold him back.  His supreme optimism in the face of the unknown is admirable, and the light hearted approach to his plight helps put things in perspective.  I also found both John Hawkes and Helen Hunt to be delightful here, especially Hunt, who manages to ease herself (and the audience) into every scene.Such a natural performance.I do wish that `The Sessions' felt a bit heavier in parts.  The light hearted tone, while effective in not being reduced to the expected, also becomes a tad overdone to the point where the impact of this particular story is deadened in the end.  When all is said and done, it leaves the audience with a bit of `is that what this was all about', and that wasn't expected.  Still, I recommend this because it approaches a very taboo subject from a different vantage point and serves up an inspiring story we could all learn from.",4,A lighter look at sex...,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,2163,"['Proof', 'are', 'kinds', 'true', 'stories', 'be', 'told', 'Sessions', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'biopic', 'Telling', 'story', 'Mark', ""O'Brien"", 'Sessions', 'sweet', 'hearted', 'look', 'one', 'man', 'struggle', 'lose', 'virginity.Mark', 'paralyzed', 'poet', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'iron', 'lung', 'limited', 'communication', 'people', 'helpers', 'priest', 'Mark', 'eventually', 'have', 'sexual', 'relations', 'woman', 'so', 'support', 'priest', 'contact', 'sex', 'therapist', 'when', 'Cheryl', 'Cheryl', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'who', 'sex', 'surrogate', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Mark', 'six', 'sessions', 'where', 'can', 'explore', 'sexuality', 'Cheryl', 'eventually', 'have', 'relations', 'will', 'be', 'introduction', 'world', 'sex', 'own', 'Being', 'nervous', 'inexperienced', 'being', 'condition', ""n't"", 'always', 'accommodating', 'first', 'few', 'sessions', 'do', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out', 'expected', 'eventually', 'hang', 'things.The', 'great', 'thing', 'Sessions', 'really', 'far', 'away', 'being', 'overtly', 'sympathetic', 'never', 'mourn', 'over', 'Mark', 'condition', 'Instead', 'celebrate', 'freedoms', 'way', 'predicament', 'never', 'making', 'sore', 'spot', 'allowing', 'hold', 'back', 'supreme', 'optimism', 'face', 'unknown', 'admirable', 'light', 'hearted', 'approach', 'plight', 'put', 'things', 'perspective', 'also', 'found', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'be', 'delightful', 'here', 'especially', 'Hunt', 'who', 'ease', 'audience', 'scene.Such', 'natural', 'performance.I', 'do', 'wish', 'Sessions', 'felt', 'bit', 'heavier', 'parts', 'light', 'hearted', 'tone', 'effective', 'not', 'being', 'reduced', 'expected', 'also', 'tad', 'overdone', 'point', 'where', 'impact', 'particular', 'story', 'deadened', 'end', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'audience', 'bit', 'what', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'expected', 'Still', 'recommend', 'very', 'taboo', 'subject', 'different', 'vantage', 'point', 'up', 'inspiring', 'story', 'could', 'learn']",The Sessions

Bush,"[1, 2]","It's been a while since I saw a quiet simple film as well written as &#34;The Sessions.&#34; I loved that they focused on a man whose disability could be very tragic but examined his sexual journey in a very matter of fact, almost cheerful way. There was a lot of humor in the film which never became gimmicky. There were many moving moments, thoughtful moments, profound moments that never became preachy or cheesy or melodramatic. I loved that the protagonist's sexual journey brought him in contact with many women but they never seemed like plot devices. Somehow (the writing again) they were all fully realized, beautiful people in their own right, even when the story didn't focus on them. I laughed, I cried and I absorbed and was humbled by the realities of a life so different from my own. I also found myself relating to his story on so many levels. The cast is fantastic. Helen Hunt had quite a balancing act to do in her role and I thought she accomplished it beautifully (while naked no less). William H.

Based on a true story, Mark O'Brien is a talented poet with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor regarding his polio; he's also a hopeless romantic yearning to discover the joys of sex, augmented by a fierce Catholic upbringing, so the conflict he's feeling is dynamic, to say the least.  He befriends an open-minded priest (William H. Macy is fantastic), and, although the padre is less than comfortable with the subject matter, he nonetheless helps Mark take his journey of self-discovery.  As does Mark's helper and caretaker, Vera (a stunning Moon Bloodgood).  Mark calls upon Cheryl to help him lose his virginity, and over the course of their sessions, both persons are moved and emotionally changed.  Cheryl, especially, is touched, as she finds herself falling in love with her soft-spoken, yet eager, disabled client.  Ultimately, this puts some strain on her own marriage, as her husband (Adam Arkin) is not happy with how the sessions are progressing.  The conflicting emotions cause the sessions to end prematurely, yet Mark has been changed enough by his experiences with Cheryl to move on and actually enjoy the few remaining years of his life, culminating in a loving, long-term relationship with a warm caretaker, Susan (Robin Weigert).  *Spoiler alert!*  The film ends with Mark's funeral, where as he mentions, in narration, he's fortunate enough to have three women he's loved in attendance.THE SESSIONS is of course an adult film, yet it is also a tender, compelling, very believable story about the never-ending will of the human spirit.

1608010,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00AEK9BKQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","The remarkably nuanced performance of John Hawkes provides the beating heart of this small 2012 independent film based on the life of poet and journalist Mark O'Brien who contracted polio at age six and spent the rest of his life in an iron lung unable to control his muscles. A chameleonic actor whose familiarity to me comes from memorably villainous turns inWinter's BoneandMartha Marcy May Marlene, Hawkes brings unexpected pathos and humor as well as a painfully realistic physicality to a role that could have easily fallen prey to the more stereotypical, life-affirming treatment you would likely find in a disease-of-the-week TV-movie. It doesn't completely escape the predictable dimensions of the genre, but the film's overriding honest sensibility and lack of cheap sentiment probably have a lot to do with the director and screenwriter Ben Lewin whose own childhood bout with polio has left him to a lifetime on crutches.Based on the subject's own writing, the story picks up Mark's life in Berkeley as he is taken care of by a series of caretakers, one a comely student named Amanda with whom he falls in love. Despite an obvious fondness for him, she cannot reciprocate his feelings for her, which leads him to seek counsel with his minister, Father Brendan. Their comic interactions eventually lead Mark at age 38 to search for the services of a sex surrogate. Enter Cheryl Cohen-Greene, a content wife and mother who matter-of-factly tells Mark that she will be his sexual guide for six sessions in which she plans to heighten his body awareness, lead him toward intercourse, and prepare him for a sexually fulfilling life. Perhaps not coincidentally, one of Helen Hunt's best early roles was as the married woman learning to cope with her lover's paraplegic state inThe Waterdance. Here the actress returns twenty years later to a similar role as Cheryl, and she turns in a terrifically brave and assured performance. Her nudity is presented in such a nonchalant manner that there isn't a hint of exploitation about it.It should come as no surprise that the physical and emotional intertwining of their relationship gets complicated but not in a way that is entirely predictable. It's clear that Cheryl is dealing with conflicts of her own, including a conversion to Judaism, that have put her in a more vulnerable state than she may have realized. In fact, none of the characters' feelings are telegraphed in a standard by-the-numbers way, and it is a testament to Lewin's filmmaking skill that he trusts his actors so fully to inhabit the roles. While Father Brendan may come across as an overgrown Berkeley hippie stereotype at times, William H. Macy is funny and endearing in his few scenes. Other smaller turns are solid - Moon Bloodgood as poker-faced attendant Vera, Annika Marks as open-hearted Amanda, and in near-cameos, Adam Arkin as Cheryl's sullen stay-at-home husband and Rhea Perlman as the cheery (pardon the pun) Mikvah lady.

(Also, maybe that's what Hunt has to do to get a decent paycheck these days?)  I have noticed in recent movies, that there is at least one full frontal shot(mostly female but some male).Reminds me of the sexual movements of the 70s (though I wasn't around then), if you've seen 70's movies, they also unabashedly used nudity bc it is natural after all, not ANYTHING to be ashamed of (though individually something to be revered and protected).I like that the movie forces us to think about sexuality for what it truly is (rather than the way narrow-minded society shoves down our throat--no pun intended) as a complement to feel-good human emotions, not the only means to happiness.

1608012,A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,B00AEK9BKQ,"Erik Olson ""Seeker Reviews""","[0, 0]","Movie: 5 Stars  Extras: 2.5 StarsDuring the 50th Annual American Atheists Convention in Austin, Texas, I had the good fortune to run into Dr. Darrel Ray, author ofSex & God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality. After I explained my situation to him (somewhat similar to that of the movie's main character), he graciously took time to have a private conversation with me and offered some possible solutions to my issue.  One suggestion he made was to watch ""The Sessions"", as according to him it gets a lot right about sexual therapy.The movie is based on the true story of journalist Mark O'Brien (John Hawkes), who as a child became paralyzed from the neck down by polio.  At the age of 38 he decided it was time to lose his virginity, and encouraged by a sympathetic priest (William H. Macy) he ends up hiring sex therapist Cheryl Cohen-Green (Helen Hunt).  At first their relationship is somewhat awkward, but as time goes on they develop a closeness that awakens jealousy in Cheryl's husband (Adam Arkin).The performances of all the principles are uniformly excellent, with Mr. Hawkes and Ms. Hunt as the standout actors of the ensemble.  Their interactions were so frank and intimate I almost felt like an intruder while watching them.  After the movie ended, I checked out the sparse but informative extras, although this was one film where a commentary was sorely missed.  However, at least I was able to purchase Kindle books by the real Mark O'Brien:How I Became a Human Being: A Disabled Man's Quest for Independence (Wisconsin Studies in Autobiography)and Cheryl Cohen-Green:An Intimate Life: Sex, Love, and My Journey as a Surrogate Partner.I was also able to find an online article written by Mark O'Brien about his time with Ms. Cohen-Green, and the movie hews fairly close to his actual experience, although some dramatic and relational liberties were taken by the filmmakers.

1608023,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00AEK9BKQ,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","THE SESSIONS is clearly one of the finest films of the year, if not the young decade. It is a true story based on the life of Mark O'Brien (July 31, 1949 - July 4, 1999), a journalist, poet and advocate for the disabled. Before this film he was the subject of `Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O'Brien', which won an Academy Award in 1997. The SESSIONS is based on his essay, ""On Seeing a Sex Surrogate"", which appeared in the Sun magazine in 1990.Without ever dipping into self pity Mark O'Brien is played by John Hawkes (in one of the finest performers by an actor is a long time) as a bright, high spirited young man confined to an iron lung at night and completely paralyzed, meaning that his writing and his telephone dialing must be accomplished with the use of a mouth-held wand. Despite his rather hopeless condition Mark concentrates on positive things: he is a 38 year old frustrated virgin who seeks advice from his priest (William H. Macy is a multifaceted, sensitive role) as well as a therapist (Blake Lindsley) who recommend Mark engage a professional sex surrogate/typical soccer mom with a house, a mortgage and a philosopher husband (Adam Arkin) named Cheryl Cohen-Greene (Helen Hunt in an underplayed, beautifully acted role). With the assistance of his changing caregivers - Amanda (Annika Marks), and Vera (Moon Bloodgood) - and his new friend, the disabled Arthrogryposis victim Carmen (Jennifer Kumiyama) and his priest's encouragement and sanction, he begins therapy with Cheryl. Though the therapy is restricted to six sessions, during these delicately and often warmly humorous sessions Mark discovers his body and is able to achieve penetration.  The therapy is a success but in the process Cheryl discovers a soft spot in her heart for Mark and knows when to call the boundaries. But Cheryl has introduced Mark to the pleasures of love and the ever-open Mark learns that there are three women who truly love him - Cheryl, Amanda, and a new acquaintance Susan (Robin Weigert). Mark has succeeded on an extraordinary personal journey to discover the wondrous pleasures that make life worth living.The ensemble cast is flawless, with excellent cameos by Rhea Perlman, Rusty Schwimmer, Ming Lo among others.  The delicately beautiful musical score is by Marco Beltrami.  Much of the success of this extraordinary film is due to the sensitive writing and directing by Ben Lewin. It is a must-own film.

1608029,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B00AEK9BKQ,Jack E. Levic,"[1, 1]","Mark O'Brien was a normal healthy child until he was striken with polio at age 6 and doomed to a lifetime or relying on others for his basic needs and his life-saving iron lung. The story could end there but O'Brien's brilliant mind and joy of living overcame all obstacles. O'Brien is not exactly paralyzed, he explains. It's his muscles that don't work. He can't move his body below his nexk yet he becomes a writer. He has feeling throughout his body but can't touch a person or object. He has a wonderful mind trapped in a body that has abandoned him.THE SESSIONS delves into one aspect of O'Brien's incredible life and the movie takes us on an incredible journey of life, love and hope. At age 38, O'Brien, with much guilty and anxiety, decides to hire a sex surrogate just to finally experience sex and physical closeness. He later wrote an article about this experience which became the basis of this book.We can look at Mark O'Brien with pity or revulsion, as many people did, or we can see him as an inspiration and a joyous creation from God. O'Brien lived an exceptionally long life, despite his condition, and touched the hearts of many. His was a true story of overcoming or at least accepting the worst obstacles life could give anyone.John Hawkes gives tremendous heart and depth to his portrayal of O'Brien. Hawkes went beyond the norm and refused doubles or special effects and turned his own body into the twisted posture of a polio-stricken O'Brien. Helen Hunt was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as Cheryl Cohen-Greene, the real-life sex surrogate that changed O'Brien's life for ever. Hunt shows her remarkable acting talents as the surrogate baring not only her heart and soul for the role but her body in very tasteful but somewhat explicit nude and sex scenes. Both Hawkes and Hunt became their roles and the connection between the actors and the real-life characters is clear.Hawkes endearing speech pattern and smile and humor endears us the O'Brien he portrays. We just want to give Hawkes and O'Brien a loving hug and to relish his delightful humorous take on life and his tragic situation. O'Brien's moral dilema is strengthed by scenes with his parrish priest placed by William H. Macy. Macy's role is important as the Catholic priest helping O'Brien wrestle with his shame and embarassment along with his strong desire to experience sex for the first time. Macy's role could have been much more and somehow the priest seems one-dimensional as he listens to O'Brien's stories about the surrogate. Obviously, there is the connection between the two as far as not having sex, except the priest has made a decision to be celibate. O'Brien is trapped in a body that is not fully functional and any chance of a normal loving relationship with a woman seems impossible.THE SESSIONS will break your heart and inspire you at the same time. There is a sweet sadness to the story that is peppered with hopelessness yet the story is full of hope and joy. It is a remarkable story that the actors and writers brought to the big screen. This fine independent film will keep you thinking and wondering. The priest says God will give O'Brien a ""pass"" on breaking the rules against pre-martital sex because of O'Brien's predicament. The moral dilemma is heartbreaking since there is no one to blame or judge here.The writers treat the story with gentle humor. Hawkes's take on O'Brien is so lively and full of joy. There is an inspirational tone to the entire film that leaves the viewer curious about O'Brien's lifem along with a bittersweet sense of hope. It is a truly wonderful film.The extras on the film are rather limited and involve Helen Hunt and John Hawkes getting into their roles. There is an interview with the real Cheryl Cohen-Greene who talks very briefly about her career as a sexy surrogate. She never mentiones O'Brien and what relationship that had and how their sessions affected her emotionally. The movie leads us to believe they had a spiritual and emotional connection in their few sessions. Cohen-Greene certainly had an immense effect on O'Brien. A brief feature on the real Mark O'Brien would have been an added plus. We're led to believe he found love the last few years of his life, but did he?

1608031,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00AEK9BKQ,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 0]","A poet in an iron lung is looking to have sex for the first time in his life. This sounds like a mix of a Lifetime Movie of the Week and a raunchy Judd Apatow sex comedy, but it's the furthest thing from both. Director Ben Lewin and amazing performances by its leads and supporting cast have crafted a mature, frank and life-affirming film about living a complete life; spiritually, emotionally, and physically.The film itself, set in 1988, is based on the real-life story and writings of Mark O'Brien (John Hawkes, who, after being in small roles for the last 15-odd years, has been making a significant name for himself lately in indies like WINTER'S BONE and MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE), a Berkeley area poet and writer who, after stricken with polio as a child, spent most of his life in an iron lung. He's never had a girlfriend and, aside from his assistants, lives a very solitary life. He does also lead a spiritual life, though, and often confides in his parish priest, Father Brendan (a wonderful William H. Macy). He falls in love with one of his assistants, the beautiful Amanda (Annika Marks), but she doesn't or can't reciprocate. He is called on by the magazine he writes for to get an article about sex and the disabled. He hires a new stone-faced, yet compassionate assistant, Vera (Moon Bloodgood of TERMINATOR: SALVATION and TV's BURN NOTICE), who helps him with his interviews. He then realizes that he desires the closeness and the intimacy of sex, which might then lead to the closeness and intimacy of love. He enters into a professional relationship with a sex surrogate, Cheryl (Helen Hunt, who has been MIA of late), who looks to help him with his unique challenge, but becomes professionally conflicted when she sees his soul laid bare as she helps him explore his still burgeoning sexuality.While this isn't a particularly amazingly visual film, flair is not necessary when you have a film that is packed to the hilt with strong and vital performances, powerful, funny and real dialogue, and a performance like Hawkes's to build around. His performance is flawless; there isn't a single note of his work in this film that you don't believe or don't see him vanish into the persona and physicality of O'Brien, and it still surprises me that he didn't make the cut for one of the actors in Oscar-nominated roles in 2012. It helps to make the strong performers around him that much stronger. Hunt, who I felt for quite some time was overrated as anything other than a sitcom actress, is absolutely stunning here as Cheryl. She never over-extends into a realm of melodrama, which it could have easily done. She's not quite in the same ballpark as Hawkes is, but it certainly close. Macy continues a streak of great supporting performances as the practical, down-to-earth Father Brendan. He's the kind of priest that everyone wished they had. Credit is also deserved my Bloodgood, Marks, Adam Arkin (as Cheryl's philosopher husband), W. Earl Brown (whose been in just about every film and TV show in the last fifteen years) as Mark's nighttime assistant and Rhea Perlman as the Mikvah Lady.Lewin never allows the film to get bogged down in the more melodramatic elements of the film and continues to show Mark's life as well as Cheryl's as their feelings begin to circle around each other's orbit as he sees her as a surrogate for all of his intimacy needs and she sees him as a true innocent and romantic. The film is also peppered throughout by some breezy comedy that never comes across as forced and a sense that all things are possible. The scenes of sexuality and nudity, and the narration of the events, are graphic, but more importantly, they're dealt with with frankness and a tenderness that few films about sexual experience are.THE SESSIONS is one of those great films that goes under many people's radar, but once you see it, you'll realize that this is one of the best films of 2012 and a woefully underseen and underrated and undeniably beautiful film.",5,Incredibly Heartfelt and Heartbreaking with Brilliant Performances.,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,3988,"['poet', 'iron', 'lung', 'looking', 'have', 'sex', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'mix', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Week', 'raunchy', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'sex', 'comedy', 'furthest', 'thing', 'Director', 'Ben', 'Lewin', 'amazing', 'performances', 'leads', 'supporting', 'cast', 'have', 'crafted', 'mature', 'frank', 'life-affirming', 'film', 'living', 'complete', 'life', 'spiritually', 'emotionally', 'physically.The', 'film', 'set', '1988', 'based', 'real-life', 'story', 'writings', 'Mark', ""O'Brien"", 'John', 'Hawkes', 'who', 'being', 'small', 'roles', 'last', '15-odd', 'years', 'been', 'making', 'significant', 'name', 'lately', 'indies', 'WINTER', 'BONE', 'MARTHA', 'MARCY', 'MAY', 'MARLENE', 'Berkeley', 'area', 'poet', 'writer', 'who', 'stricken', 'polio', 'child', 'spent', 'most', 'life', 'iron', 'lung', 'never', 'had', 'girlfriend', 'aside', 'assistants', 'very', 'solitary', 'life', 'also', 'lead', 'spiritual', 'life', 'often', 'confides', 'parish', 'priest', 'Father', 'Brendan', 'wonderful', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'love', 'one', 'assistants', 'beautiful', 'Amanda', 'Annika', 'Marks', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'reciprocate', 'called', 'magazine', 'get', 'article', 'sex', 'disabled', 'new', 'stone-faced', 'yet', 'compassionate', 'assistant', 'Vera', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'TERMINATOR', 'SALVATION', 'TV', 'BURN', 'NOTICE', 'who', 'interviews', 'then', 'closeness', 'intimacy', 'sex', 'might', 'then', 'lead', 'closeness', 'intimacy', 'love', 'professional', 'relationship', 'sex', 'surrogate', 'Cheryl', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'who', 'been', 'MIA', 'late', 'who', 'help', 'unique', 'challenge', 'professionally', 'conflicted', 'when', 'soul', 'laid', 'bare', 'explore', 'still', 'burgeoning', 'sexuality.While', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'amazingly', 'visual', 'film', 'flair', 'not', 'necessary', 'when', 'have', 'film', 'packed', 'hilt', 'strong', 'vital', 'performances', 'powerful', 'funny', 'real', 'dialogue', 'performance', 'Hawkes', 'build', 'around', 'performance', 'flawless', ""n't"", 'single', 'note', 'work', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'vanish', 'persona', 'physicality', ""O'Brien"", 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'cut', 'one', 'actors', 'Oscar-nominated', 'roles', '2012', 'make', 'strong', 'performers', 'that', 'much', 'stronger', 'Hunt', 'who', 'felt', 'quite', 'time', 'was', 'overrated', 'anything', 'other', 'sitcom', 'actress', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'here', 'Cheryl', 'never', 'realm', 'melodrama', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'done', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'ballpark', 'Hawkes', 'certainly', 'close', 'Macy', 'streak', 'great', 'supporting', 'performances', 'practical', 'down-to-earth', 'Father', 'Brendan', 'kind', 'priest', 'everyone', 'wished', 'had', 'Credit', 'also', 'deserved', 'Bloodgood', 'Marks', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'Cheryl', 'philosopher', 'husband', 'W.', 'Earl', 'Brown', 'been', 'just', 'film', 'TV', 'show', 'last', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Mark', 'nighttime', 'assistant', 'Rhea', 'Perlman', 'Mikvah', 'Lady.Lewin', 'never', 'film', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'elements', 'film', 'show', 'Mark', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'Cheryl', 'feelings', 'begin', 'circle', 'other', 'orbit', 'surrogate', 'intimacy', 'needs', 'true', 'innocent', 'romantic', 'film', 'also', 'peppered', 'breezy', 'comedy', 'never', 'across', 'forced', 'sense', 'things', 'are', 'possible', 'scenes', 'sexuality', 'nudity', 'narration', 'events', 'are', 'graphic', 'more', 'importantly', ""'re"", 'dealt', 'frankness', 'tenderness', 'few', 'films', 'sexual', 'experience', 'are.THE', 'SESSIONS', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'many', 'people', 'radar', 'once', 'see', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2012', 'woefully', 'underseen', 'underrated', 'undeniably', 'beautiful', 'film']",The Sessions

A couple of years ago, I had some lively discussions on this topic with one of my JayFlix friends, a health-care professional who was attending a young quadriplegic. Now this film-festival favorite addresses the question, only this man isn't paralyzed with no physical sensations, instead he is a polio survivor confined to an iron lung since childhood. Furthermore, he is a witty, well-educated and frustrated adult.Based on the real-life story of Mark O'Brien (1949-1999), a Berkeley poet and journalist, he was the first severely disabled student to graduate from college, earning a bachelor's degree in 1982, and acceptance to a post graduate program. His inspiring story has been told once before in a documentary film, ""Breathing Lessons,"" directed by Jessica Yu. It won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short in 1997. This version is written and directed by the acclaimed Ben Lewin, himself a polio survivor who requires crutches.We watch:* John Hawkes (""Contagion"") is brilliant as Mark O'Brien, who wryly tells his priest he wants to experience sex before his ""Use-By date"" expires. Hawkes is an amazing chameleon who transforms himself from film to film, each time I am stunned to discover who I have just watched. There is some well-deserved Oscar buzz about this film.* Helen Hunt (""As Good as it Gets"") is Cheryl Cohen Greene, a professional therapist hired to provide basic instruction in human sexuality. Her therapy is bluntly anatomical and unembarrassed while at the same time, extremely sensitive and insightful. His responses are usually humorous and disarming. Hunt is fearless but convincing, and is beautifully naked a lot of the time.* William H. Macy (""The Lincoln Lawyer"") is Father Brendon, our hero's priest, who fears he might have unleashed some major sinning by counseling his parishioner to ""Go for it!"" This priest spent his childhood on a farm, so his observations are very forthright and practical.This film proves two points:1) Our biggest sex organ is between our ears;2) One of the most seductive things about another person may be an ability to make us laugh. O'Brien, when asked if he is religious, replies, ""Of course I am! I've gotta have someone to blame!""There are many happy spots in this inspiring piece and as we exited the theater, we were subdued but satisfied...smile....I'll be happy when Amazon notifies me of the DVD release.",5,A Burdensome Virginity,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,2475,"['How', 'do', 'lose', 'virginity', 'have', 'been', 'confined', 'iron', 'lung', 'most', 'life', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'lively', 'discussions', 'topic', 'one', 'JayFlix', 'friends', 'health-care', 'professional', 'who', 'was', 'attending', 'young', 'quadriplegic', 'Now', 'film-festival', 'favorite', 'question', 'only', 'man', ""n't"", 'paralyzed', 'physical', 'sensations', 'instead', 'polio', 'survivor', 'confined', 'iron', 'lung', 'childhood', 'Furthermore', 'witty', 'well-educated', 'frustrated', 'adult.Based', 'real-life', 'story', 'Mark', ""O'Brien"", '1949-1999', 'Berkeley', 'poet', 'journalist', 'was', 'first', 'severely', 'disabled', 'student', 'graduate', 'college', 'earning', 'bachelor', 'degree', '1982', 'acceptance', 'post', 'graduate', 'program', 'inspiring', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'once', 'before', 'documentary', 'film', 'Breathing', 'Lessons', 'directed', 'Jessica', 'Yu', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'Short', '1997', 'version', 'written', 'directed', 'acclaimed', 'Ben', 'Lewin', 'polio', 'survivor', 'who', 'crutches.We', 'watch', '*', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'Contagion', 'brilliant', 'Mark', ""O'Brien"", 'who', 'wryly', 'priest', 'experience', 'sex', 'Use-By', 'date', 'Hawkes', 'amazing', 'chameleon', 'who', 'film', 'film', 'time', 'am', 'stunned', 'discover', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'watched', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'film', '*', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'As', 'Good', 'Gets', 'Cheryl', 'Cohen', 'Greene', 'professional', 'therapist', 'hired', 'provide', 'basic', 'instruction', 'human', 'sexuality', 'therapy', 'bluntly', 'anatomical', 'unembarrassed', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'insightful', 'responses', 'are', 'usually', 'humorous', 'disarming', 'Hunt', 'fearless', 'convincing', 'beautifully', 'naked', 'lot', 'time', '*', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'Father', 'Brendon', 'hero', 'priest', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'unleashed', 'major', 'sinning', 'counseling', 'parishioner', 'Go', 'priest', 'spent', 'childhood', 'farm', 'observations', 'are', 'very', 'forthright', 'practical.This', 'film', 'two', 'points:1', 'biggest', 'sex', 'organ', 'ears', '2', 'One', 'most', 'seductive', 'things', 'person', 'may', 'be', 'ability', 'make', ""O'Brien"", 'when', 'asked', 'religious', 'replies', 'course', 'am', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'have', 'someone', 'blame', 'are', 'many', 'happy', 'spots', 'inspiring', 'piece', 'exited', 'theater', 'were', 'subdued', 'satisfied', 'smile', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'when', 'Amazon', 'DVD', 'release']",The Sessions

Helen Hunt is a sex therapist who has 6 sessions to unlock O'Brien's fettered sexuality. And Bill Macy plays the parish priest who befriends O'Brien and gives him unoffical license to fulfill his humanity.The film deals with the web of emotions that is unleashed by the encounters. O'Brien is gratified by the physical release he experiences, but is desperate for the human love and emotional intimacy that is normally concommitant to a sexual encouter. Helen Hunt is torn by her deep feelings for O'Brien, her professionalism and her duty to her family. And Macy struggles to leaven his role as O'Brien's priest with his role as O'Brien's friend and confidante.There is an awful lot of nudity and frank sexuality in the film.

After all, I read the essay ""On Seeing a Sex Surrogate"" back in The Day; and I'm an admirer of the late Mark O'Brien's poetry.  I hate ""disability of the week"" movies, and I was worried this would be one.  Well, I was oh, so wrong.  The Sessions gives me hope on many levels.HOPEFULNESS SCALE:1) The Sessions addresses Mark O'Brien's need to fully become an adult at 38 -- both emotionally and sexually.2) The Sessions opens with a shot of O'Brien's iron lung in his *home.* (Many folks won't even know what an iron lung is or what it does. After this film, folks'll know.)3) Due to the subject matter, there's a lot of nudity (full-frontal female only), talk of sex and sex between an able-bodied woman and a man whose body is paralyzed from the neck down.4)The Sessions shows people with disabilities as sensual, sexual human beings. And some as isolated human beings. (Isolation is a common problem for us.)5) The Sessions' Cheryl explains the difference between a sex surrogate and a prostitute. (One doesn't want repeat business, the other does.) Ms. Hunt is almost normal weight as Cheryl. This makes her appear more sensual and fully adult. The Sessions between Mark and Cheryl are shown as mutually nourishing.6) Some of O'Brien's attendants are depicted as caring and others as not so much.7) The Priest is also shown as a caring man, who, at first, has no clue how to deal with O'Brien's long-winded, funny, and, by necessity, out-in-the-open public confessions. Over the course of the film, they become friends.8) O'Brien was a devout Catholic in life, and he is shown to be one in The Sessions.7) The Sessions closes with the iron lung.STEP BACKWARDS FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS SCALE:1) The Sessions was made with the sensibilities of the able-bodied in mind. Just sayin'.2) Mark O'Brien was shown solely on a gurney when he's out and about. O'Brien used a specialized wheel chair, too -- and was using it during the time he was seeing Cheryl. It's a nit-picky point, but it's an important point.On the whole, though, The Sessions broke a barrier. For once, I watched a film in which the person with a disability is a human being -- not a victim, not a courageous Polio, not a perfect construct labeled Disabled Man in Iron Lung Circa 1990. Mark O'Brien is shown to be a flawed, lonely,intelligent, humorous individual filled with longing to be loved -- and to lose his virginity before he dies. AND it's filled with quotes from the real O'Brien's writings.Speaking as a person with multiple disabilities, I think The Sessions is a fine, if flawed, film. It treated me as an adult most of the time; and it gives our society a glimpse into a world it's just not used to seeing. The Sessions could be an excellent starting point for an interesting discussion... I recommend it highly. And --Yay! Just Yay!",5,Yay!

1608072,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00AEK9BKQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","After making a splash at this year's Sundance film festival, the provocatively themed ""The Sessions"" has created a fair amount of buzz both for its subject matter and for its performances. Based on the true story of Mark O'Brien, the movie tackles a topic that might make some uncomfortable--sex, specifically sex and the disabled. In an era where any amount of violence and gore is perfectly acceptable, I still don't understand why it is verboten for American movies to deal with sexual issues in a frank and adult manner. So I appreciate that writer/director Ben Lewin made ""The Sessions"" with a matter-of-fact boldness uncommon in today's movies. The movie is frank, explicit, and both emotionally and physically revealing. Instead of feeling unnecessarily prurient, however, the movie is surprisingly life affirming. It is sensitive about its topic, but also quite humorous. I was afraid the film might be a little too clinical, depressing or dispassionate but it is, instead, eminently relatable and entertaining.O'Brien, a paralyzed man who spent his nights in an iron lung, has tried to live the best life that he can. He's a professional writer, and has attempted to get as much normalcy out of his days as possible. At 36, though, he is thinking more and more about relationships, love, and sex. He wants to experience human intimacy in all of its forms. After exposing himself emotionally, he decides to seek out a more straightforward answer to losing his virginity. With the advice of his priest (William Macy) and the assistance of his aide (Moon Bloodgood), he contacts a sex surrogate to assist. The remainder of the movie details these sessions in much explicitness. They have surprising candor, insight and impact. The movie does not ask you to feel sorry for O'Brien (a great decision) because of his disability, but to experience this journey with him as a man. In other hands, ""The Sessions"" might have had an entirely different tone. But Lewin keeps things lively, grounded and believable.The ever-impressive John Hawkes is a revelation as O'Brien. This great character actor is really coming into his own, and this is easily his most realized starring performance. From years as a side kick (Deadwood), he has startled with a number of creepier roles (Oscar nominated for Winter's Bone). His performance here ranks with the very best of the year, though. Obviously, the role is reliant on minimal movement but Hawkes does everything he needs just through facial expressions, dialogue, and voice over. He is matched by Helen Hunt in what I think is her best role as well. Hunt doesn't shy away from anything in this piece. Her choices are fearless and bold. This is a pairing that you won't soon forget. When these two are together, ""The Sessions"" rivals anything else on screen this year. It's not a perfect film, however, some of the supporting roles or side choices are a bit less developed. But overall, this is a joyful expression of life. While the movie is infused with an underlying sadness, this is not a depressing experience but a hopeful one. A nice character piece for adult audiences.

It was done with him telling his own life's story and it compelled me to watch this film.This movie is very touching and also disturbing. It's hard to watch how one person has to bear their soul to people who just don't get what it's like to have to depend on others for everything, whether they want to or not.However, the film gets quite detailed in showing how Mark goes forward trying to overcome the barriers put in place by able-bodied society. He is also portrayed as a man who knows he has been infantalized and has to some extent internalized this, making himself doubt whether he is ready for carnal knowledge.Although Helen Hunt does well as the sex surrogate, this whole line is a fabrication...it never happened this way, as those who know Mark will attest. She supposedly is very professional in what she does until she works with a man who has disability, so now she magically has inappropriate feelings!?The most troubling thought I have about this film deals with a problem I find with many films that portray persons living with disability: WHERE are the actors who are living with disability??? Why must we watch a whole parade of actors receive awards for the &#34;courageous&#34; way they played the part of a person living with disability????????Now that I've gotten that out of my system, I am glad the topic of this movie is put out there. There are many people living with disability through no choice of their own are kept from experiencing the act of having sex or making love because the puritans in charge of them would say they have no need for that.

I thought all of the characters were placed in situations that for many people would be uncomfortable.

Fundamentally I think the movie was well directed, shot, etc., but I just didn't care for the story in general.

1608113,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00AEK9BKQ,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","This is an autobiographical story of poet Mark O'Brien who was stricken by polio and spent much of his life in an iron lung. In 1988 at the age of 38 he decides he wants to lose his virginity. A sure bet for an Oscar nomination, John Hawkes plays O'Brien. Hawkes' already thin frame is reduced even more to where his muscle tone approaches that of a polio victim. His acting is mostly confined to his vocal inflections and facial expressions.Before going much further, let's be clear about one thing. This isn't a dower, conventional weepy film. If anything it's uplifting. O'Brien is a funny guy and some of the scenes between him and his understanding priest (William H. Macy) are some of the best in the film. Once O'Brien gets the Church's go ahead, he hires a sex surrogate (excellent Helen Hunt) to guide him through his ultimate goal. While there is nothing overly salacious in the scenes involving O'Brien and Cheryl (Hunt), they are pretty graphic. Ms. Hunt in particular, leaves little to the imagination.Perhaps under-appreciated in the film is O'Brien's caretakers. One, played by Moon Bloodgood, I found particularly interesting. I would have liked to have seen her role a bit meatier. Perhaps it is no surprise, that in spite of O'Brien's physical limitations, he's quite the hit with the ladies, especially those closest to him. Director and writer Ben Lewin does a nice balancing act, given the sexual and religious overtones. The movie is well photographed giving a strong sense of reality of Berkeley, California in the late 1980's. Excellent film.The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p resolution and maintains the original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Even for those used to seeing quality in Blu ray discs will appreciate the perfection of this issue.  It is absolutely gorgeous in terms color, clarity and sharpness.  I saw nothing in terms of image anomalies.  This is a dialog centered film so the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio track doesn't provide much in the way of surrounds other than ambient sounds.

1608126,A11B6LNU5MS6V,B00AEK9BKQ,N. Sturm,"[1, 2]","According to rave reviews this story is beautiful and uniquely human.  In fact, everything a person does is human, dontcha know, and I don't understand the need to attach ""beautiful"" to every story of personal hardship and tragedy.  We seem to be the culture that needs to experience *everything* vicariously, but The Sessions isn't much of an experience.  I didn't like it, didn't hate it, but I'm sure I should have felt something and I didn't do that either.Part of the problem, I think, is that this movie shows us way too much.  The sex scenes come off as clinical, because they are-- both in the sense that they're a ""treatment"" for the main character and in that they're about as interesting for the viewer as a medical brochure.  Tab A goes here and so on.  Why not less of that and more insight into Mark?  I think that's what the priest character was for, but then, he's distracting because his opinions make no sense for a man of the church.  Mark asks him outright if he should have sex outside of marriage, and the priest replies that, due to Mark's condition, he thinks God would understand.  That might by what your average layperson would say, but I'm pretty sure the official line of Christianity is you don't break major rules just because you feel like it.  If there was such a priest in the real Mark's life (can't find a yes or no) then I take back everything I said.  If not, the character's just plain out of place.Even though we all do it, watching someone try to get laid doesn't scream ""triumph of the human spirit"" because whether a person is getting sex is usually only really important to that person.  When I think about it, I'd have been much more interested in a movie about how Mark got that degree he was seen receiving at the beginning, since college is a real achievement whether you can breathe on your own or not.  (And what are the logistics of that?  How do you type with your mouth fast enough to take notes?  Can he see the board?  etc.) I know a person who can't have sex is going to think about it a lot, maybe even feel incomplete for not having it, but at the end the movie literally measures Mark's worth in the number of beautiful women he's been able to attract.  We don't even see anything of his life with the woman who stays with him.I suppose for people out there who didn't know disabled people can have sex lives, this may have been a real eye opener.  Maybe it would appeal more to someone who does watch a lot of movies about people trying to get laid, and has now decided to include a disabled person's quest for diversity's sake.  And maybe this movie really inspired some people.  That's nice.  But to me it just felt like an underdeveloped story that wasn't entirely film-worthy in the first place.

I'm not going to spoil your viewing experience by disclosing how it all plays out, but I will say that the last half hour of the movie is bittersweet and very touching, and I welled up more than once.Several comments: first and foremost, John Hawke's performance will simply blow you away. I cannot imagine that he will not get an Oscar nomination for this. Of course, Helen Hunt's performance surely is Oscar-worthy as well, and not only because of the daring and frequent (but never exploitive) nudity. The immediate subject matter of the movie (sex for the disabled) is handled with care and grace. The buzz for this movie has been steadily growing in recent months, and I must say I was quite surprised how poorly attended the screening was which I attended a few weekends ago here in Cincinnati. Maybe it was just a coincidence. I sure hope so, as I very much enjoyed this movie from start to finish.

1608175,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00AEK9BKQ,Steven Aldersley,"[3, 5]","*This review contains spoilers, but nothing significant that wasn't shown in the trailer*Here's a movie that would never have been made 30 or 40 years ago, because of the subject matter. It's based on the true story of how 38-year-old Mark O'Brien (Hawkes) tried to lose his virginity. What complicates matters is that he spends most of his life inside an iron lung, and he can only leave it for two or three hours at a time. He's a polio victim, and while he's able to feel sensation in every part of his body, his muscles aren't strong enough to enable him to stand. In fact, his emaciated body has trouble remaining straight, even with him lying down.Are you depressed yet? It doesn't sound like a very uplifting story, does it? Actually, it may surprise you.Although Mark's situation is serious, and is treated as such for the most part, the movie is full of humor. Don't misunderstand me; it's not a comedy, but the story of a man who uses humor to enable him to tolerate his limited existence. If you have ever seen The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, you'll know exactly what I mean. As I enjoyed the humor, I wondered whether that's a common defense mechanism for people with physical handicaps, or a device used by the director to make a grim situation more palatable for the audience.We see Mark try a series of caregivers, before eventually settling on Vera (Moon Bloodgood). She's friendly and clearly gets on well with Mark, supporting him whenever she can. Mark decides that he wants to experience sex before he dies, but he's a religious man and doesn't feel comfortable pursuing the idea without the blessing of his priest, Father Brendan (Macy). Macy is great in his role, and gives us a way to hear Mark's thoughts, doubts, and ideas. The exchanges between the two provide many of the movie's highlights.After getting permission to see a sex surrogate, Mark sets up the appointment. This is where things really start to get interesting. He meets Cheryl (Hunt), who is assigned to teach him about sex. There is a lot of nudity from this point on, and the R-rating is justified. If you are squeamish about nudity, or planning on watching it with a young child, it won't be a good choice. The discussions between Cheryl and Mark are frank and to the point, with constant references to sexual practices and terminology. Cheryl says at the outset that she can only meet Mark for a maximum of six sessions, presumably to make it clear that the two aren't entering into a permanent relationship. She's married with a son, and this is her occupation; she's not a prostitute.Put yourself in Mark's position for a moment. It's a natural human need, so why should he miss out? The movie handles the subject well, keeping things serious when they need to be. If the humor had been misplaced, or too frequent, it would have cheapened the story. But the balance is just about perfect, and I found myself empathizing with Mark and rooting for him.It's an adult movie that will make you laugh out loud frequently, and perhaps shed a tear. Hawkes is superb in the role and was unlucky not to be nominated. Hunt gained the movie's only nomination, and her performance was faultless. I liked the characters and appreciated everything about the movie. It's one that I'll probably pick up on Blu-ray in the near future.",4,Amusing and touching with excellent performances,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,3315,"['*This', 'review', 'spoilers', 'nothing', 'significant', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'movie', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'made', '30', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'subject', 'matter', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'how', '38-year-old', 'Mark', ""O'Brien"", 'Hawkes', 'tried', 'lose', 'virginity', 'What', 'matters', 'most', 'life', 'iron', 'lung', 'can', 'only', 'leave', 'two', 'three', 'hours', 'time', 'polio', 'victim', 'able', 'feel', 'sensation', 'part', 'body', 'muscles', 'are', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'enable', 'stand', 'fact', 'emaciated', 'body', 'trouble', 'remaining', 'straight', 'even', 'lying', 'down.Are', 'depressed', 'yet', ""n't"", 'sound', 'very', 'uplifting', 'story', 'Actually', 'may', 'surprise', 'Mark', 'situation', 'serious', 'treated', 'such', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'full', 'humor', 'Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'not', 'comedy', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'humor', 'enable', 'tolerate', 'limited', 'existence', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', ""'ll"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'mean', 'enjoyed', 'humor', 'wondered', 'common', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'people', 'physical', 'handicaps', 'device', 'used', 'director', 'make', 'grim', 'situation', 'more', 'palatable', 'audience.We', 'see', 'Mark', 'try', 'series', 'caregivers', 'eventually', 'settling', 'Vera', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'friendly', 'clearly', 'well', 'Mark', 'supporting', 'whenever', 'can', 'Mark', 'experience', 'sex', 'religious', 'man', ""n't"", 'feel', 'comfortable', 'pursuing', 'idea', 'blessing', 'priest', 'Father', 'Brendan', 'Macy', 'Macy', 'great', 'role', 'way', 'hear', 'Mark', 'thoughts', 'doubts', 'ideas', 'exchanges', 'two', 'provide', 'many', 'movie', 'highlights.After', 'getting', 'permission', 'see', 'sex', 'surrogate', 'Mark', 'up', 'appointment', 'where', 'things', 'really', 'start', 'get', 'interesting', 'Cheryl', 'Hunt', 'who', 'assigned', 'teach', 'sex', 'lot', 'nudity', 'point', 'R-rating', 'justified', 'are', 'squeamish', 'nudity', 'planning', 'watching', 'young', 'child', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'discussions', 'Cheryl', 'Mark', 'are', 'frank', 'point', 'constant', 'references', 'sexual', 'practices', 'terminology', 'Cheryl', 'outset', 'can', 'only', 'meet', 'Mark', 'maximum', 'six', 'sessions', 'presumably', 'make', 'clear', 'two', 'are', ""n't"", 'entering', 'permanent', 'relationship', 'married', 'son', 'occupation', 'not', 'prostitute.Put', 'Mark', 'position', 'moment', 'natural', 'human', 'need', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'miss', 'out', 'movie', 'subject', 'well', 'keeping', 'things', 'serious', 'when', 'need', 'be', 'humor', 'had', 'been', 'misplaced', 'too', 'frequent', 'would', 'have', 'cheapened', 'story', 'balance', 'just', 'perfect', 'found', 'empathizing', 'Mark', 'rooting', 'him.It', 'adult', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'loud', 'frequently', 'perhaps', 'shed', 'tear', 'Hawkes', 'superb', 'role', 'was', 'unlucky', 'not', 'be', 'nominated', 'Hunt', 'gained', 'movie', 'only', 'nomination', 'performance', 'was', 'faultless', 'liked', 'characters', 'appreciated', 'everything', 'movie', 'one', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'pick', 'up', 'Blu-ray', 'near', 'future']",The Sessions

I know, I know, it  sounds creepy and pornographic,  But I was intrigued by the trailer, which actually seemed to be tasteful.  Well into the movie, I was surprised to notice that the sexual content and nudity [of which there is plenty] really became very secondary to the emotionally moving heart of the film. John Hawkes does an Oscar-worthy job as the paralyzed therapy-seeker who  has the courage to look for love. I don't know how many actors could engage the audience with the limitations imposed upon him, but he pulls it off using only his facial expression and dialog.  By the end of the movie, he has become someone all of us would like to know.  Helen Hunt is terrific [and gutsy, at her age] as the therapist.  Ordinarily she portrays characters with a bit of a tough exterior, but she also dug deep for this role, and is convincing as a compassionate therapist, willing to be vulnerable to help a fellow human being realize his greatest wish and full expression of his humanity.

Well, they manage to pull it off in the true life story, 'The Sessions'. John Hawkes, known for a couple of psycho roles in 'Winter Bones' and 'Martha Macy May Marlene', magnificently transforms himself into the severely handicapped Mark O'Brien, disabled since childhood with polio and forced to live in an iron lung, except for about four hours per day. O'Brien is not technically paralyzed but his muscles are useless, and he can only move his lips and neck. He gets out of the house on a gurney, pushed by attendants working on day and night shifts.'The Sessions' manages not to be maudlin or heavy handed due to the remarkable personality of O'Brien. In spite of the crushing limitations of his life, O'Brien manages to be relatively optimistic. He writes poetry and communicates with others, not expressing self-pity, but with a wry sense of humor. His confidante is Father Brendan, a liberal priest, winningly played by William H. Macy. When O'Brien informs Father Brendan that he seeks to lose his virginity by employing a sex surrogate, the good Father notes that having sex outside of marriage is a sin. But given O'Brien's situation, Father Brendan wisely adds that in this case, he believes that God can make an ""exception"".The bulk of 'The Sessions' revolves around O'Brien's session with sex surrogate, Cheryl Cohen-Greene (professionally played by Helen Hunt). At first, O'Brien is deathly afraid of the encounters with Cohen-Greene, but she soon gets him to relax and he's able to have intercourse with her. Initially, they agree on eight sessions but cut things off after six, as Cohen-Greene finds that O'Brien is falling in love with her and her emotions are getting in the way too.There are other characters that drift in and out of O'Brien's life, including Amanda, a volunteer with the disabled, who befriends O'Brien, but eventually has to move away, due to guilt feelings about not wanting to have an intimate relationship with him. One of O'Brien's attendants, Vera, also adds a great deal of texture to O'Brien's moving journey. Eventually, a woman, Susan, becomes O'Brien's partner for the rest of the five years of his life and provides him with meaningful companionship.One scene that doesn't completely ring true is Cohen-Greene's husband, Josh, becoming jealous over a letter O'Brien sends her. On the plus side, the film is also not without a moment of high drama when there's a power failure and O'Brien is trapped in a non-functioning iron lung without anyone there to help him.The Session's director, Ben Lewin, a polio survivor himself, lends his expertise on the subject to the production. One critic felt that the film needed to be truer to the real-life O'Brien's writings.Nonetheless, due to its fine performances, 'The Sessions' appears to rise above standard TV movie fare.

1608200,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00AEK9BKQ,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[104, 112]","The Sessions is an extraordinary little indie film based on an even more extraordinary true story.  In 1988, Mark O'Brien, a thirty-eight year old poet, journalist and advocate for the disabled living in Berkeley, California, decided to lose his virginity.  This may not sound very extraordinary unless you know that O'Brien, severely afflicted by polio as a child, had spent most of his life in an iron lung and was unable to move any part of his body below the neck.O'Brien's decision was prompted as a result of research he was doing for an article on the sex lives of disabled people.  After interviewing a number of disabled people, and seeing how many of them were in fact enjoying an active and rewarding sex life in spite of their disabilities, O'Brien began to consider his own sex life, or rather, his complete lack of one, and how he might go about changing that.  The issue was further complicated for O'Brien by the fact that he was a devout Catholic and what he was contemplating - sex outside of marriage - was a moral issue as well as a physical one.  So in addition to consulting a sex therapist for help with his physical challenges, he also consulted with his local priest for what was for him a moral challenge as well.It is important to understand the exact nature of O'Brien's situation.  He was not paralyzed, at least not neurologically.  Polio afflicts the muscles, leaving them weak and atrophied, but not the nerves, and so although he couldn't move, O'Brien could still feel and his 'equipment' still worked, albeit in moments that were more embarrassing than anything that could be considered pleasurable, given that the only people ever touching him or seeing him naked were doctors, nurses and attendants. And he could survive outside of the iron lung for a few hours at a time, though he had to be kept on a gurney which let him lie prone.  But this made it possible for him to do things like attend university where he ultimately earned his degrees in English and journalism (and later to have his sessions with the sex therapist). Ultimately though he always had to be put back into the iron lung as his own lungs were only strong enough to function on their own for those few hours.The story of O'Brien's quest for non-virginity is brought vividly to life in first-class performances carried out by a marvelous cast.  John Hawkes (best known for his Oscar-nominated supporting performance in 2010's Winter's Bone) does an outstanding job as Mark O'Brien, rising to the challenge not only of portraying a man solely through the use of his head and face but also finding O'Brien's voice, bringing out his combination of intelligence and humor along with his anxieties and vulnerabilities, both physical and emotional.  Helen Hunt (best known for her Oscar-winning performance in 1997's As Good As It Gets) is equally outstanding as Cheryl Cohen Greene, the sex therapist who works with O'Brien to help him achieve his goal of becoming a fully realized sexual person, bringing out Greene's own struggle between her commitment to always maintaining a professional distance with her clients and her inability to not be moved by O'Brien's mix of raw vulnerability and nervous courage.  And his ability to find humor in spite of his situation.  ""I have to believe in God,"" O'Brien says at one point.  ""I would find it absolutely intolerable not to be able to blame someone for all this.""The supporting cast is also quite excellent.  William H. Macy does a nice turn as Father Brendan, the priest O'Brien turns to for guidance with his dilemma.  In what could easily have been a mere comic clich&eacute; role, Macy instead delivers a nuanced performance as a man who seriously weighs the church's position against the sheer humanity of the situation he's been presented with and then goes with his basic humanity, telling O'Brien ""I have a feeling that God is going to give you a free pass on this one.  Go for it.""  Macy does bring a gentle humor to the situation, showing Brendan's awkward discomfort at advising someone with such an unusual problem, but gives it a solid grounding by showing Brendan's commitment to giving the best spiritual guidance he can, even if he does feel completely out of his depth.  Moon Bloodgood delivers a quietly funny performance as Vera, the supportive attendant who accompanies O'Brien on his interviews for his article and to his sessions with Greene, doing her best to be stoically professional even as her highly expressive face reveals her inner reactions to the things she sees and hears in the course of her duties.  And Jennifer Kumiyama is quite engaging as Carmen, a wheelchair-bound woman with Arthrogryposis who's cheerfully chatty about her sex life when O'Brien interviews her for his article and who ends up letting O'Brien and Greene use her apartment for their initial sessions.As both director and screenwriter, Ben Lewin brings a special insight and sensitivity to the film, being someone who was afflicted with polio himself as a child and who must use arm braces to move about.  In addition to drawing on his own experiences while writing the screenplay, Lewin worked closely with Susan Fernback, O'Brien's partner of several years, and with Greene, wanting the script to be as faithful to O'Brien the man as humanly possible.  The music score by Marco Beltrami is appropriately subtle, present in the background and discretely adding to the tone or feel of a scene but never threatening to distract from or overwhelm what's happening on the screen.  In some movies the director depends on the score to tell you what you're supposed to be feeling, but The Sessions has no such need.But it's Hawkes and Hunt who carry the heart of the movie and they do it marvelously well.  Hawkes' challenge is first to portray O'Brien's extreme limitations and vulnerability, and then, having done that, to get you to see beyond those things to the man O'Brien really was.  Not without some cost though.  One of the things Hawkes did was to lie on a soccer ball-sized foam rubber sphere during filming to simulate O'Brien's curvature of the spine.  However effective the results were visually, the constant pressure against Hawkes' spine resulted in him developing back problems.  Hunt's challenge was similar in that her role required her to spend a lot of her screen time naked, playing a woman who was both comfortable and professional at being naked and in a sexual situation with her clients, and then to slowly reveal Greene's growing discomfort with the fact that in spite of her professionalism she cannot be completely dispassionate about O'Brien, that there is something about him that is connecting with her and making her feel for him.  It's a tribute to the chemistry that develops between these two fine actors that the sexual aspect of their situation ultimately becomes secondary to the emotional and human connection that's being made.In 1997, O'Brien was the subject of a short film by Jessica Yu, Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O'Brien, which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject.  In it, he makes the statement ""The two mythologies about disabled people break down to:  one, we can't do anything, or two, we can do everything.  But the truth is, we're just human.""  That, more than anything else, sums up what The Sessions is all about.Highly, highly recommended.",5,"""But the truth is, we're just human.""",1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,7397,"['Sessions',

1608202,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B00AEK9BKQ,William Timothy Lukeman,"[1, 1]","While contemporary entertainment is awash in graphic sexuality, the vast majority of it has all the emotional depth of a snickering adolescent boy immersed in Internet porn. Happily, that's not the case in this warm, very rewatchable true story of a disabled man wanting to experience sex before his death, and the sexual surrogate who helps him to discover the pleasures & joys of his body. But what's really impressive is how the film avoids the other potential danger of such a film -- being so noble & high-minded that it becomes ethereal, losing the necessary carnality of sex. Everything is just right here, presented with good humor, tenderness, and a refreshing matter-of-factness that never becomes too clinical & detached. Helen Hunt richly deserved her Oscar nomination, but lead John Hawkes was just as deserving & should have been nominated as well. And William Macy, as the compassionate priest who obviously cares more about the spirit than the letter of the law, provides solid support. In fact all the supporting characters add to the story -- but it's essentially a two-character drama, one that thankfully never becomes too dramatic. It feels like real life, and it deals with sex in a truly adult manner, exploring both the emotional & physical needs of human beings. It touches on loneliness, on the need for intimacy on all levels, and celebrates the lush satisfactions of the flesh. These are real bodies of real people, both vulnerable & resilient, not insanely sculpted & exaggerated cartoons. And as real people, they have complex feelings, which are also revealed in all their contradictory & wonderful aspects. If only more films had this much maturity -- enthusiastically recommended!",5,For genuine adults,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1713,"['contemporary', 'entertainment', 'awash', 'graphic', 'sexuality', 'vast', 'majority', 'emotional', 'depth', 'snickering', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'immersed', 'Internet', 'porn', 'Happily', 'not', 'case', 'warm', 'very', 'rewatchable', 'true', 'story', 'disabled', 'man', 'wanting', 'experience', 'sex', 'death', 'sexual', 'surrogate', 'who', 'discover', 'pleasures', 'joys', 'body', 'what', 'really', 'impressive', 'how', 'film', 'other', 'potential', 'danger', 'such', 'film', 'being', 'so', 'noble', 'high-minded', 'ethereal', 'losing', 'necessary', 'carnality', 'sex', 'Everything', 'just', 'right', 'here', 'presented', 'good', 'humor', 'tenderness', 'refreshing', 'matter-of-factness', 'never', 'too', 'clinical', 'detached', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'richly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'lead', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'was', 'just', 'deserving', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'as', 'well', 'William', 'Macy', 'compassionate', 'priest', 'who', 'obviously', 'more', 'spirit', 'letter', 'law', 'solid', 'support', 'fact', 'supporting', 'characters', 'add', 'story', 'essentially', 'two-character', 'drama', 'one', 'thankfully', 'never', 'too', 'dramatic', 'real', 'life', 'sex', 'truly', 'adult', 'manner', 'exploring', 'emotional', 'physical', 'needs', 'human', 'beings', 'loneliness', 'need', 'intimacy', 'levels', 'lush', 'satisfactions', 'flesh', 'are', 'real', 'bodies', 'real', 'people', 'vulnerable', 'resilient', 'not', 'insanely', 'sculpted', 'exaggerated', 'cartoons', 'real', 'people', 'have', 'complex', 'feelings', 'are', 'also', 'revealed', 'contradictory', 'wonderful', 'aspects', 'only', 'more', 'films', 'had', 'much', 'maturity', 'enthusiastically', 'recommended']",The Sessions

1608206,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00AEK9BKQ,Z Hayes,"[5, 5]","My husband rented ""The Sessions"" last night and initially I balked at watching it. A severely disabled man's yearning to experience intimacy, his confessions to his Catholic parish priest, and his intimate sessions with his sex surrogate just seemed a tad weird for me, but it was a slow night and I thought I'd give it a try.I am immensely glad I did because this movie proved to be an immensely engaging viewing experience. Yes, the very subject nature of the film makes it one of those awkward movies, and there is certainly a fair amount of frank and explicit discourse on sex, the main character expounding on his sexual angst and yearnings, and of course some explicit sexual situations. Yet, the movie is grounded and credibly portrays the main character's struggles to come into his own, to claim his manhood and to learn how to have a satisfying sexual relationship.John Hawkes plays a 38-year-old severely disabled writer, Mark O'Brien, who needs to be in an iron lung for most of his waking hours. Overcome by a desperate need to experience sexual intimacy (he can't even masturbate, but is capable of achieving a full erection), Mark decides to confess his yearnings to his parish priest, Father Brendan, played by William H. Macy, who acts as his confessor/confidante. Mark eventually hooks up with sex surrogate Cheryl, played by Helen Hunt, and this is where the movie truly takes off. Each scene between Mark and Cheryl packs an emotional wallop, their interactions coming across as credible and poignant as they gently navigate the awkwardness of the situation - Cheryl playing the role of the experienced tutor/therapist/surrogate who gently guides Mark from learning the essentials of foreplay to actual intercourse. It sounds so clinical putting it here in writing, but their on-screen chemistry makes it appear these two individuals are not merely playing a part but are the characters they inhabit.It is a revelation of a film, and its frank portrayal of sex and the disabled is to be commended. It would not have been something I would have chosen to watch, but now that I have, I'm glad I did. The main cast does an amazing job with Hawkes delivering an Oscar-worthy performance (he is definitely turning out to be a great character actor), and Hunt is as always a magnetic presence on screen (she does bare all for this role). The secondary characters did well too - William H. Macy does a credible job in his role as father confessor/confidante and Moon Bloodgood as Vera, Mark's able aide who develops a soft spot for him.Far from being depressing and bizarre, I actually thought ""The Sessions"" was thought-provoking, honest, and grounded, not to mention entertaining.
