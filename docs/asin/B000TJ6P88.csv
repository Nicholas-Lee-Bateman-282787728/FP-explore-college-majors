It took me three times to get through it.  I'd watch 20 minutes and say I'll get back to this when I have nothing better to do.  I kept hoping it would get better, considering some of the actors have been involved in some pretty good projects.

That being said, I will tell you that the wonderful cast is burdened by a less than stellar script. I also found the jumping in scenes to be sometimes poorly timed. However, if you are looking for a an uplifting family film for the holiday season that is fun and inoffensive, you would not go wrong with Santa Trap. And, of course, in the end we discover that there really is a Santa.But, didn't we know that all along?",4,"Great cast, good film.",1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,503,"['Christmas', 'movies', 'never', 'get', 'old', 'Santa', 'Trap', 'exception', 'rule', 'being', 'said', 'will', 'tell', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'burdened', 'less', 'stellar', 'script', 'also', 'found', 'jumping', 'scenes', 'be', 'sometimes', 'poorly', 'timed', 'However', 'are', 'looking', 'uplifting', 'family', 'film', 'holiday', 'season', 'fun', 'inoffensive', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'Santa', 'Trap', 'course', 'end', 'discover', 'really', 'Santa.But', 'did', ""n't"", 'know']",Santa Trap
1090534,A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B000TJ6P88,M. Hill,"[7, 7]","Released in 2002, The Santa Trap has an easily recognizable cast - Shelley Long, Robert Hayes, Corbin Bernsen, Dick Van Patten, Stacey Keach and Adrienne Barbeau.  All are terrific actors, and given a better script this movie would be vastly improved, but that said, it is still a good movie. It was particularly entertaining to see Stacey Keach as an aging biker dude.As with most Christmas movies, the viewer must suspend disbelief, and this is no exception. Santa, Dick Van Patten pays a visit to a family newly moved to Los Angeles (Long, Hayes and their two children) and they are in need of some Christmas spirit. Through a series of missteps Santa is first arrested, then while incarcerated his cell mate (Keach) switches clothes with him and is bailed out. Meanwhile, after the reindeer returned without him, the elves are searching for Santa. One improbable event happens after another, but it is all harmless and turns out just fine in the end.  This is a lightweight Christmas movie with an interesting cast.  For those with small children, please note that the son tells the young daughter that there is no Santa Claus. Santa does appear and the family ends up believing in his existence.",4,Fun Christmas Movie with Good Cast,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,1200,"['Released', '2002', 'Santa', 'Trap', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'cast', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'Robert', 'Hayes', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Patten', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'are', 'terrific', 'actors', 'given', 'better', 'script', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'vastly', 'improved', 'said', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'see', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'aging', 'biker', 'dude.As', 'most', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'viewer', 'must', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'exception', 'Santa', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Patten', 'visit', 'family', 'newly', 'moved', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Long', 'Hayes', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'need', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'series', 'missteps', 'Santa', 'first', 'arrested', 'then', 'incarcerated', 'cell', 'mate', 'Keach', 'clothes', 'bailed', 'out', 'Meanwhile', 'reindeer', 'returned', 'elves', 'are', 'searching', 'Santa', 'One', 'improbable', 'event', 'happens', 'harmless', 'out', 'just', 'fine', 'end', 'lightweight', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'interesting', 'cast', 'small', 'children', 'please', 'note', 'son', 'young', 'daughter', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Santa', 'appear', 'family', 'up', 'believing', 'existence']",Santa Trap

I knew Shelley Long wasn't a very good actress but I hoped the rest could pull this movie through.The basic idea for the movie is pretty cool: Santa is captured by a little girl (Judy Emerson played by Sierra Abel who is just a dreadful actress) and hauled off to jail by the local Keystone cops. OK, OK, it's a little hokey I know but I thought it had potential.The dialogue was just awful. Everyone, including the good actors spoke in monotone and appeared to be reading their lines off cue cards. The camerawork was average with several occasions of un-centered characters and shifting too soon. Scenes in the beginning of the movie were shifting faster than a NFL quarterback running from Ray Lewis.Other than these complaints the movie was fine.",2,Don't Bother,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,830,"['Looking', 'cast', 'actors', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'offering', 'knew', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'hoped', 'rest', 'could', 'pull', 'movie', 'through.The', 'basic', 'idea', 'movie', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Santa', 'captured', 'little', 'girl', 'Judy', 'Emerson', 'played', 'Sierra', 'Abel', 'who', 'just', 'dreadful', 'actress', 'hauled', 'off', 'jail', 'local', 'Keystone', 'cops', 'OK', 'OK', 'little', 'hokey', 'know', 'thought', 'had', 'potential.The', 'dialogue', 'was', 'just', 'awful', 'Everyone', 'including', 'good', 'actors', 'spoke', 'monotone', 'appeared', 'be', 'reading', 'lines', 'cue', 'cards', 'camerawork', 'was', 'average', 'several', 'occasions', 'un-centered', 'characters', 'shifting', 'too', 'soon', 'Scenes', 'beginning', 'movie', 'were', 'shifting', 'faster', 'NFL', 'quarterback', 'running', 'Ray', 'Lewis.Other', 'complaints', 'movie', 'was', 'fine']",Santa Trap
