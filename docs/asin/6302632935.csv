323753,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6302632935,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This movie came out in 1970 and I enjoyed it greatly as a college freshman. It was a very revealing hot film even if it was not a financial or critical success.  I decided to take a second look after 40 years and despite the criticism, the film really is good entertainment.  It is an extremely ambitious film, full of characters, and full of European jet set dynamics and South American politics.  The cast is very good with Candice Bergin demonstrating her considerable abilities early in her film making career. The depiction of the sexual appetites of the international jet set was ahead of its time.  This is also one of those rare films where the film is much better than the book. Harold Robbins wrote the Adventurers based on the life story of a polo playing playboy, Porfirio Rubirosa, from the Dominican Republic who marries heiress Barbara Hutton and then later Za Za Gabor.  The film captures the foreign intrigue and double dealing and the drugs and alcohol and parties of the beautiful people. Dax Xenos, the main character, based on Rubirosa, undergoes many traumas as a child which retards his emotional ability to love but certainly does not retard his ability to seduce and marry wealthy women. Dax gathers considerable wealth, slowly matures and becomes a responsible adult, which is a primary theme of the film. However the corruption of power, especially evident in South American politics, is also the context in which Dax lives and which he eventually gains the maturity to try to impact for the better. So we see a child, traumatized by violence and the murder of his mother and sister, become an international playboy seducing every attractive and wealthy woman he meets, only to finally be confronted with his personal power to impact injustice and maybe correct some of the wrongs he himself has committed through omission and commission. The film is highly entertaining.",4,An entertaining film about the international jet set of the 70s,1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,1898,"['movie', 'came', 'out', '1970', 'enjoyed', 'greatly', 'college', 'freshman', 'was', 'very', 'revealing', 'hot', 'film', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'financial', 'critical', 'success', 'decided', 'take', 'second', 'look', '40', 'years', 'criticism', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'entertainment', 'extremely', 'ambitious', 'film', 'full', 'characters', 'full', 'European', 'jet', 'set', 'dynamics', 'South', 'American', 'politics', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'Candice', 'Bergin', 'demonstrating', 'considerable', 'abilities', 'early', 'film', 'making', 'career', 'depiction', 'sexual', 'appetites', 'international', 'jet', 'set', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'also', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'where', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'book', 'Harold', 'Robbins', 'wrote', 'Adventurers', 'based', 'life', 'story', 'polo', 'playing', 'playboy', 'Porfirio', 'Rubirosa', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'who', 'heiress', 'Barbara', 'Hutton', 'then', 'later', 'Za', 'Za', 'Gabor', 'film', 'foreign', 'intrigue', 'double', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'parties', 'beautiful', 'people', 'Dax', 'Xenos', 'main', 'character', 'based', 'Rubirosa', 'undergoes', 'many', 'traumas', 'child', 'emotional', 'ability', 'love', 'certainly', 'not', 'retard', 'ability', 'seduce', 'marry', 'wealthy', 'women', 'Dax', 'gathers', 'considerable', 'wealth', 'slowly', 'matures', 'responsible', 'adult', 'primary', 'theme', 'film', 'However', 'corruption', 'power', 'especially', 'evident', 'South', 'American', 'politics', 'also', 'context', 'Dax', 'lives', 'eventually', 'gains', 'maturity', 'try', 'impact', 'better', 'see', 'child', 'traumatized', 'violence', 'murder', 'mother', 'sister', 'become', 'international', 'playboy', 'seducing', 'attractive', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'only', 'finally', 'be', 'confronted', 'personal', 'power', 'impact', 'injustice', 'maybe', 'correct', 'wrongs', 'committed', 'omission', 'commission', 'film', 'highly', 'entertaining']",Adventurers VHS

323759,A3CM1985CV46CD,6302632935,John Ashley Nail,"[3, 3]","Though ""The Adventurers"" has many of the trappings of a grand epic, it's ultimately one long trash wallow--one I thoroughly enjoyed. The engrossing story, about a South American playboy who vows to avenge the death of his parents, is a three-hour slog through violence, sex, deceit, more violence, polo, some more sex, silly fashion shows, marriage, divorce, double-crosses and another heaping helping of violence. You may not be impressed, but you certainly won't be bored. The cast is OK, with Ernest Borgnine making the most favorable impression. Bekim Fehmiu is adequate as Dax Xenos, though he looks more at home in the role in the latter third of the movie, when he's supposed to be in his late 30s, than in the first half when he's supposed to be in his early 20s. Candice Bergen tends to be wooden (comedy is more her fort&eacute;), but she looks lovely, which is pretty much all that's expected of the women in this movie. Look for a young Jaclyn Smith in a bit part as a reporter.""The Adventurers"" is big and expensive looking, but it can't escape the pulpiness of the Harold Robbins novel on which it's based.

323762,A3IM77LLZAN8B6,6302632935,J. W. Hickey,"[6, 6]","My vague memory of THE ADVENTURERS was that it was a campily bad studio flick--one I'd never bothered to see when it came out in 1970.  Nearly 40 years later, it turns out to be extremely entertaining as a DVD experience.  On the big screen during the era of EASY RIDER and M*A*S*H, it's easy to see that this would be considered an overproduced, overblown bore.  But with a pre-CGI cast of thousands and extravagant sets, it's now truly impressive.I haven't been a reader of Harold Robbins, but this film explains his popularity.  The fantasy elegance of the rich and ambitious is tremendous fun, and he crams more plot into his story that a whole shelf of Galsworthy.  Except for a 4-yr-old in the second part of the movie (yes, there's actually an intermission!), even the kid actors are good in their roles.I'd expected VALLEY OF THE DOLLS and instead found the epic sweep and sturdy dialogue of the Taylor-Burton CLEOPATRA.  True, a number of the sex scenes look like PLAYBOY (not PENTHOUSE) layouts from the '60s (James Bondy but even more lavish), and a couple of daringly camp touches after the intermission are a hoot:  a VALLEY OF THE DOLLS fashion show, and an UNDER THE YUM YUM TREE lothario's lair.All in all, however, this DVD is a good investment and, of course, after large portions of such rich scenes and scenery, one can turn off the DVD for a while to recupe before plunging again into its fabulous excess!",4,a stylish guilty pleasure,1178928000,"05 12, 2007",2007,1426,"['vague', 'memory', 'THE', 'ADVENTURERS', 'was', 'was', 'campily', 'bad', 'studio', 'flick', 'one', ""'d"", 'never', 'bothered', 'see', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1970', 'Nearly', '40', 'years', 'later', 'out', 'be', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'DVD', 'experience', 'big', 'screen', 'era', 'EASY', 'RIDER', 'M*A*S*H', 'easy', 'see', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'overproduced', 'overblown', 'bore', 'pre-CGI', 'cast', 'thousands', 'extravagant', 'sets', 'now', 'truly', 'impressive.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'reader', 'Harold', 'Robbins', 'film', 'popularity', 'fantasy', 'elegance', 'rich', 'ambitious', 'tremendous', 'fun', 'more', 'plot', 'story', 'whole', 'shelf', 'Galsworthy', '4-yr-old', 'second', 'part', 'movie', 'yes', 'actually', 'intermission', 'even', 'kid', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'roles.I', ""'d"", 'expected', 'VALLEY', 'THE', 'DOLLS', 'instead', 'found', 'epic', 'sweep', 'sturdy', 'dialogue', 'Taylor-Burton', 'CLEOPATRA', 'True', 'number', 'sex', 'scenes', 'look', 'PLAYBOY', 'not', 'PENTHOUSE', ""'60s"", 'James', 'Bondy', 'even', 'more', 'lavish', 'couple', 'daringly', 'camp', 'touches', 'intermission', 'are', 'hoot', 'VALLEY', 'THE', 'DOLLS', 'fashion', 'show', 'UNDER', 'THE', 'YUM', 'YUM', 'TREE', 'lothario', 'lair.All', 'however', 'DVD', 'good', 'investment', 'course', 'large', 'portions', 'such', 'rich', 'scenes', 'scenery', 'one', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'DVD', 'while', 'recupe', 'plunging', 'again', 'fabulous', 'excess']",Adventurers VHS

The DVD case presents a movie that is a romantic action adventure, a children's movie (rated PG) or at least family movie about a hero who gets the girl and everything turns out all right in the end.This movie is rated PG.We open on a boy and his dog, idyllic, playful, nothing to worry about.  The music is friendly, the colors are friendly, the land is friendly, everything is perfect.  Then a gunshot rings out and the dog falls dead.  The boy runs to a villa, where he watches his family get raped and murdered, all very bloody, violent, and horrifying (much like the same type of violence in A Clockwork Orange, actually).This movie is rated PG.We follow this boy's journey through life, not as an action adventure, but as an epic... the story of a man who, after the trauma of his family's near complete distruction, is sent away to Rome to escape the made-up South American land of Corteguay, where he transistions between being an adulterist playboy (much like a less liked and less proactive James Bond, which is interesting because the director made Moonraker), to an apathetic, bitter nigh-rapist, to the potential savior of Cortequay who is only used and abused by its leaders until he himself falls victim and nothing changes for the better.This movie is rated PG.We follow a whole melange of extra characters as they move through their either abused, poor life without happiness, or their empty, corrupted life as the rich, and how they all intermix and intermingle to create a land, Corteguay, that is constantly at war with itself, and how they all add to it their own violence.This movie is rated PG.We follow playboys into S&M; dungeons (again, imagery very alike A Clockwork Orange), young boys becoming men by shooting down rows of prisoners with automatic machine guns, women without control of their independence, civil leaders claiming that ""There must be a cohesion of evil and politics,"" revolutionaries who rape, pillage, plunder, and massacre; prostitute nuns, apathetic heroes, unstimulating sex (and lots of it), children getting killed, and the beauty of civilization and nature juxtaposed with explosions and grimacing Gothic architecture, idealistic moments ALWAYS ended suddenly with pronounced, crippling pain.This movie is rated PG.I'll go out on a limb here and say that it's probably likely nobody likes this movie.

It impressed me then and still does, for several reasons. First, it has a very good cast. And they are not completely wasted, only 75 percent wasted. Second, it has plenty of sex, violence, and the other human failings that make watching other people so much fun. Third, sure, it's overly ambitious, and falls well short of its grand intentions. But, it is a trip worth taking even if you know you're headed down a dead-end street.  Don't listen to the so-called experts. This movie is one that is worth making up your own mind.

323768,ABN7RI1VBAKE5,6302632935,Steve Stubbs,"[19, 20]","Most people who saw this movie did not understand it, and when it was first released in 1970 the sex and violence were so far over the top for the period that most critics couldn't see the top.  The movie, like a lot of the actresses it featured, was topless.  Today it is par for the course.  The gorgeous photography, however, is far better than what one sees in most modern films.The story is a roman a clef.  The fictional South American country Corteguay is not either of its quasi-namesakes Paraguay or Uruguay but Colombia, where much of the principal photography was done.  Dax Xenos is not really Dax Xenos but Porfirio Rubirosa, who was not from Corteguay or Colombia but the Dominican Republic, which is not a South American country but a Carribean country.  (Harold Robbins admitted this, so there is no doubt.)  Rubirosa was not the playboy son of a diplomat.  He WAS a diplomat, who discovered early on that he could use his diplomatic skills to become a wealthy man by becoming a playboy and marrying wealthy women.  The most engrossing fiction is based loosely on reality.That said, what makes the movie work is its theme.  In movies, the character who changes is the main character, regardless of what the billing says, and the only character in this movie who changes is Dax.  He starts out a cynical playboy, out to charm his way into the beds and bank accounts of wealthy ladies, and ends up a saint, struggling valiantly to change the world for the better.  Alas, for the world will not change, and protects its scumbag identity by killing the irritating Dax, so things can go on being as corrupt as ever.  The theme is therefore that the world will not change and perhaps even cannot change.  But individuals can.  Whatever his failings in early life, before Dax is murdered he thoroughly redeems himself.  There is hope, the author is saying, for the individual, but not for the larger context in which he lives.  The story therefore combines hard nosed realism with a cautious optimism, and the result will win over the most cynical among us.  I know because ""the most cynical among us"" is the way I would describe myself and the story makes sense to me.If you understand this, the whole middle of the movie, which follows Dax and his friends as they acquire the wealth and power they need to fulfill their respective destinies, makes sense and is thoroughly enjoyable.  This part of the film is necessary to make sense of the movie's ending, in which Dax confronts the corruption that has plagued his beleaguered homeland.If there are sex and violence and drugs in the movie that is because there are sex and violence and drugs in the real world in which characters like this live.  As one of the characters in the movie says, his people did not get to where they were by being philanthropists.  He could have added that they did not get to where they were by being burdened with unnecessary impediments like scruples.  Welcome to the world of the upper class.Oh, yes, and the book is not better than the movie.  The movie in this case is better than the book.  Much better.  The book needed an editor in the worst way.  The movie had one.  It is too long for some tastes, but it works well as home entertainment because you can watch as much as you want in one sitting.  Then come back for more later.  I have probably watched it twenty times.  I will probably watch it twenty more.The best movie by far made from a Robbins novel, only rivaled by The Betsy.
