Brad Pitt is very understated in this movie, doesn't quite go over the top like in his other films. Katherine Keener is excellent has his insecure, emotionally unstable girlfriend. Interesting film about relationships but I have to admit it doesn't really go anywhere. It can't decided if it wants to be a straight ahead romantic comedy or a surreal Lynchian type trip, and kind of meanders between both, the result is somewhat tepid. Mostly for Pitt or Keener fans.One thing that REALLY annoyed me though, was my DVD had stupid commentary at the beginning and the end which I *swear* is not on the VHS version. Kind of reminded me of Blade Runner, just ruined it. It's not quite as bad as BR, but I was disapointed.",3,low key movie with good acting,1026777600,"07 16, 2002",2002,778,"['like', 'movie', 'interesting', 'yet', 'not', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'very', 'understated', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'go', 'top', 'like', 'other', 'films', 'Katherine', 'Keener', 'excellent', 'insecure', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'girlfriend', 'Interesting', 'film', 'relationships', 'have', 'admit', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decided', 'be', 'straight', 'ahead', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'surreal', 'Lynchian', 'type', 'trip', 'kind', 'meanders', 'result', 'somewhat', 'tepid', 'Mostly', 'Pitt', 'Keener', 'fans.One', 'thing', 'REALLY', 'annoyed', 'was', 'DVD', 'had', 'stupid', 'commentary', 'beginning', 'end', '*swear*', 'not', 'VHS', 'version', 'Kind', 'reminded', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'just', 'ruined', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'BR', 'was', 'disapointed']",N/A

It's worth buying, but may be hard to find as it was not released in theaters nationwide when made. Don't be fooled by Pitt's hair on the cover - this story takes place some time around the Punk/Glam era. Anyone who has good memories of that period will probably enjoy this. Some of the music was written by the film director/writer himself and recorded but hard to find. If you're a Brad Pitt fan you'll definitely like it. If you were ever a struggling musician you'll identify with it. Johnny has an odd obsession with Ricky Nelson music and other vintage things - but he's still a musician, songwriter and struggling to have a band. Amusing story about the shoes he wears, how he got them and what they did for him, the era such a person is living in, how he got his name and the fact that this is all based on things that occurred during those years of the writer's life. The soundtrack is fitting and even if it's not your fave type of music you'll still like it in this film. This movie is fun, interesting and has great acting. It's too bad it wasn't promoted more when made. It's enjoyable and shouldn't be over-thought, as it can be misunderstood and seem not quite as good. If you don't want to buy it, at least try to see it. Made around the time fo Thelma and Louise, Pitt was not well known but you can still see his acting potential and he plays this part well. Different people will like it for different reasons, nevertheless it's still a ""feel good"" movie for me.",5,Great Brad Pitt flcik that should have been promoted better,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,1570,"['Johnny', 'SuedeThis', 'great', 'movie', 'even', 'better', 'listen', 'writer', 'commentary', 'worth', 'buying', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'theaters', 'nationwide', 'when', 'made', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'Pitt', 'hair', 'cover', 'story', 'place', 'time', 'Punk/Glam', 'era', 'Anyone', 'who', 'good', 'memories', 'period', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'music', 'was', 'written', 'film', 'director/writer', 'recorded', 'hard', 'find', ""'re"", 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'were', 'ever', 'struggling', 'musician', ""'ll"", 'identify', 'Johnny', 'odd', 'obsession', 'Ricky', 'Nelson', 'music', 'other', 'vintage', 'things', 'still', 'musician', 'songwriter', 'struggling', 'have', 'band', 'Amusing', 'story', 'shoes', 'how', 'got', 'what', 'did', 'era', 'person', 'living', 'how', 'got', 'name', 'fact', 'based', 'things', 'occurred', 'years', 'writer', 'life', 'soundtrack', 'fitting', 'even', 'not', 'fave', 'type', 'music', ""'ll"", 'still', 'like', 'film', 'movie', 'fun', 'interesting', 'great', 'acting', 'too', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'promoted', 'more', 'when', 'made', 'enjoyable', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'over-thought', 'can', 'be', 'misunderstood', 'seem', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'least', 'try', 'see', 'Made', 'time', 'fo', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'Pitt', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'acting', 'potential', 'part', 'well', 'Different', 'people', 'will', 'like', 'different', 'reasons', 'still', 'feel', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

I am of the opinion that Brad Pitt was trying way too hard in his earlier roles to channel James Dean.  It never worked.  Why accentuate the problem with an outdated look and attitude toward life?  Catherine Keener plays a girlfriend agent of change who almost breaks through the old patterns.  Ultimately, both she and the audience realize he's a rebel without a future.

666424,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B00005MM6V,Thomas M. Sipos,"[0, 0]","JOHNNY SUEDE does what indie films do best.  It presents an odd, unique vision that's tough to describe or market.  (A similar oddball film is THE LAST BIG THING).The film takes place in Brooklyn, but you wouldn't know it unless you read the credits.  It's not the recognizable Brooklyn of Spike Lee, or Woody Allen, or John Travolta.  With the sparse sets and anachronistic pop music costumes (of Darlette, Johnny, and Freak) I wasn't even sure about the time period.  Sometimes it seems to be set in a surreal alternate realm (like STREETS OF FIRE).Johnny is a musician who plays retro rock, but his huge pompadour hair is so buffonish, one wonders if he's not meant as a caricature, a joke that no one quite gets.  Then one sees Freak Storm in the same hair, and one wonders again if we're in an alternate realm in which this is a common style.  (We see the same bizarre hair in TROUBLE IN MIND, and that film was indeed set in the near future.)Like STREETS OF FIRE, JOHNNY SUEDE draws you in.  You can't try and figure out this film, you just have to accept it on its own terms and enjoy the ride.The music is excellent.  I wish they'd release a soundtrack, though it seems they never have.I disagree with a comment that said that everyone takes advantage of Johnny.  I see it as largely the other way.  Johnny is a parasite and sloth.  (1) Deek tries to help him with getting a real job, and even lends him money.  Johnny shows no gratitude.  (2) Johnny turns down a music gig because it goes against his artistic sensibility to perform without a bassist, even though the other band members are ready and willing to go ahead.  Then Johnny complains that it's the others who are no help.  (3) Not wanting to work, Johnny comes up with the idea of robbing a barber shop.  Deek does the work of getting the gun, but Johnny flakes out.  (4) Yvonne is a devoted girlfriend, cooking for Johnny, baking him a birthday cake, buying him a shirt, and Johnny only cheats on her in return.  (5) Johnny is behind on his rent, so he's also taking advantage of his landlord.  (6) And Johnny tries to take advantage of Darlette's music business mother.  Sure, she also wants to bed him.  But does that let Johnny off the hook?Ultimately, JOHNNY SUEDE is fascinating to watch, occassionally funny (especially Freak Storm), with great music.  But it's also a depressive film.  These people do not live great lives, and there's no bright future ahead.  All they have is their youth, which allows them to dream.  What will happen when they're no longer young?Johnny is happy only because he's too dense to know better, his vision of reality obscured by his dream world.  However, there's a hint of hope at the end, in that he apologizes to Yvonne and loses his shoe (the latter perhaps symbolizing his budding maturity).I've seen this film several times.
