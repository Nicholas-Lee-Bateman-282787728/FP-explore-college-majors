This film tells an incredibly sad real story of animal abuse and nothing more. Sure, a well-meaning but totally ignorant socialite adopting a gorilla and two chimps seems at first like a kindness, but it isn't. Ultimately chaos ensues and the biggest losers are, of course, the animals who are caged, forced to wear human clothing and experience terrible exploitation at various public venues including The Chicago World's Fair.  Finally, all three animals are totally abandoned by their rich and clueless ""family"" and die in captivity.

565562,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000053VAG,Michael Butts,"[0, 0]","BUDDY starts out pretty good, but then misfires and becomes a self-parodying, rather improbable movie.  Director Caroline Thompson wants to make several points about animal cruelty and how important animals can be.  But in the preposterously ditsy Gertrude Lintz, she gives us a woman who is so obsessed with turning her animals into human playthings.  The chimpanzees are cute, but dressing them up and treating them as children may show some underlying psychological problems for Ms. Lintz.  Inspired by true events, which according to other reviewers is far from accurate, BUDDY gives us a refined Rene Russo in an uncharacteristic role as Lintz.  Russo does fine in the role, but Lintz seems so out of touch with reality that it doesn't ring true.  Robbie Coltrane is charming as her doctor husband, and he and Russo do have a nice chemistry.  Alan Cumming is good as the ""nanny"" but his role is too underdeveloped to really matter.  The film does have some humorous moments and I particularly enjoyed the parrot, particularly when maid Irma P. Hall is running a blender and the parrot is mimicking her.  The contest is funny.  The problem with BUDDY is Buddy himself.  The animatronic baby is about as convincing as an Ed Wood movie, and when Buddy grows, we know there's a human in a gorilla suit.  Buddy loses credibility; if this was an animated film, then maybe I could have bought it, but without detracting from Jim Henson's crew, it is obvious even to children that we're not dealing with a real gorilla.  Buddy himself becomes so violent and uncontrollable, I lost interest in his fate.Children will probably enjoy the animal antics, but BUDDY doesn't leave me with any kind of message or impact.",2,GORILLA MY DREAMS,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,1709,"['BUDDY', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'then', 'misfires', 'self-parodying', 'rather', 'improbable', 'movie', 'Director', 'Caroline', 'Thompson', 'make', 'several', 'points', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'how', 'important', 'animals', 'can', 'be', 'preposterously', 'ditsy', 'Gertrude', 'Lintz', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'obsessed', 'turning', 'animals', 'human', 'playthings', 'chimpanzees', 'are', 'cute', 'dressing', 'up', 'treating', 'children', 'may', 'show', 'underlying', 'psychological', 'problems', 'Ms.', 'Lintz', 'Inspired', 'true', 'events', 'according', 'other', 'reviewers', 'far', 'accurate', 'BUDDY', 'refined', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'uncharacteristic', 'role', 'Lintz', 'Russo', 'fine', 'role', 'Lintz', 'so', 'touch', 'reality', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'charming', 'doctor', 'husband', 'Russo', 'do', 'have', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'good', 'nanny', 'role', 'too', 'underdeveloped', 'really', 'matter', 'film', 'have', 'humorous', 'moments', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'parrot', 'particularly', 'when', 'maid', 'Irma', 'P.', 'Hall', 'running', 'blender', 'parrot', 'mimicking', 'contest', 'funny', 'problem', 'BUDDY', 'Buddy', 'animatronic', 'baby', 'as', 'convincing', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'movie', 'when', 'Buddy', 'know', 'human', 'gorilla', 'suit', 'Buddy', 'credibility', 'was', 'animated', 'film', 'then', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'bought', 'detracting', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'crew', 'obvious', 'even', 'children', ""'re"", 'not', 'dealing', 'real', 'gorilla', 'Buddy', 'so', 'violent', 'uncontrollable', 'lost', 'interest', 'fate.Children', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'animal', 'antics', 'BUDDY', ""n't"", 'leave', 'kind', 'message', 'impact']",Buddy

It is the telling of a true story in which Trudy Lintz, ( played by Rene Russo ) a true animal lover, ""adopts"" a baby male gorilla. Trudy already has a home filled with many animals including birds, dogs and chimps. Being rich, she was able to provide these animals with a very loving home and environment. The mischevious chimps Joe and Maggie are halarious in this movie as we see them do everything but talk! We see Buddy grow from a baby gorilla into a huge silverback. There are very funny scenes in this movie and a few that are sad like when we see Buddy wanting to be set free. We see Buddy escape and create much chaos. Eventually, Trudy realizes that Buddy would be much happier among other gorillas so she buys him his own ""sanctuary"" where he is set free among other gorillas.

After one such outing, she has occasion to adopt a sickly baby gorilla. She names him Buddy, and takes him home to her M.D. husband (Robbie Coltrane) to see if he can cure the petite primate. Buddy is never portrayed by a real gorilla; the infant version was animatronic and the adult gorilla was a human in gorilla suit. However, there are several other real animals in the movie including dogs, cats, horses, and chimpanzees. The chimps are seen riding a pony, pouring themselves a drink, shaking hands, and even using a key to unlock a door.
