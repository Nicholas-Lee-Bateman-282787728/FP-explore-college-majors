Along the way their support structure is ample.  A Tufts University Professor of exercise physiology, who is also an avid marathoner, serves as their guide.  The Tufts track coach serves as their running mentor.  Uta Pippig, a physical dynamo (won 3 Boston marathons, 1 NY marathon, was in 2 separate Olympics), provided inspiration, advice, and motivation through her cute accent, transforming the letter t into d on most occasions.  Additionally, they had access to top notch medical assistance.  Before the race they were given VO2 Max tests (used to calculate efficient oxygen utilization) and body composition measurements in the DEXA machine.  In other terms, they were measured, weighed, evaluated, and tested to the Nth degree.  Nearly all medical evaluations and tests are accompanied by a fancy animation showing the internal workings of the human body, and how running, for the most part, improves its function.  I enjoyed each of these interludes and learned a few things along the way.  However, making this sound like 13 people just fell off the couch and worked themselves into marathon shape without assistance is a bit disingenuous.  Akin to the Biggest Loser reality show, the final accomplishment is personal; but each had a lot of help from trained professionals along the way.Having said that, the effort would have to be a success considering 12 out of 13 original participants got to the starting line and finished the Boston Marathon.  No, they didn't ""qualify"" for the Boston Marathon; some finished in excess of 6 hours, but they did complete the race.  And that's what this documentary is about: finishing a marathon.I would have liked to know more about each person's training beyond simply putting in the miles - which is the most important part - and perhaps some other aspects like diet, time constraints, motivating factors, running techniques/guidance provided by Uta, but for an hour the bare-bones approach has at least a few humanitarian angles in it to support most of the runners.Geared towards the novice runner or the couch potato searching for inspiration, this should be enough to get most people off their behinds and running down the street.",5,Wonderful Documentary - Mental Fuel for the average runner,1308528000,"06 20, 2011",2011,2608,"['program', '1-hour', 'time', 'limit', 'total', 'run', 'time', '53', 'minutes', 'nearly', 'year-long', 'footage', 'provided', 'editing', 'difficulties', 'results', 'Nova', 'Marathon', 'Challenge', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'heartwarming', 'inspiring.The', 'Challenge', 'was', 'simple', 'find', '13', 'sedentary', 'non-athletes', 'people', 'referred', 'initially', 'coach', 'dog', 'meat', 'transform', 'structured', 'guidance', 'support', 'marathon', 'finishers', 'way', 'support', 'structure', 'ample', 'Tufts', 'University', 'Professor', 'exercise', 'physiology', 'who', 'also', 'avid', 'marathoner', 'serves', 'guide', 'Tufts', 'track', 'coach', 'running', 'mentor', 'Uta', 'Pippig', 'physical', 'dynamo', 'won', '3', 'Boston', 'marathons', '1', 'NY', 'marathon', 'was', '2', 'separate', 'Olympics', 'provided', 'inspiration', 'advice', 'motivation', 'cute', 'accent', 'transforming', 'letter', 't', 'd', 'most', 'occasions', 'Additionally', 'had', 'access', 'top', 'notch', 'medical', 'assistance', 'race', 'were', 'given', 'VO2', 'Max', 'tests', 'used', 'calculate', 'efficient', 'oxygen', 'utilization', 'body', 'composition', 'measurements', 'DEXA', 'machine', 'other', 'terms', 'were', 'measured', 'weighed', 'evaluated', 'tested', 'Nth', 'degree', 'Nearly', 'medical', 'evaluations', 'tests', 'are', 'accompanied', 'fancy', 'animation', 'showing', 'internal', 'workings', 'human', 'body', 'how', 'running', 'most', 'part', 'function', 'enjoyed', 'interludes', 'learned', 'few', 'things', 'way', 'However', 'making', 'sound', '13', 'people', 'just', 'fell', 'off', 'couch', 'worked', 'marathon', 'shape', 'assistance', 'bit', 'disingenuous', 'Akin', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'reality', 'show', 'final', 'accomplishment', 'personal', 'had', 'lot', 'help', 'trained', 'professionals', 'way.Having', 'said', 'effort', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'success', 'considering', '12', '13', 'original', 'participants', 'got', 'starting', 'line', 'finished', 'Boston', 'Marathon', 'No', 'did', ""n't"", 'qualify', 'Boston', 'Marathon', 'finished', 'excess', '6', 'hours', 'did', 'complete', 'race', 'what', 'documentary', 'finishing', 'marathon.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'know', 'more', 'person', 'training', 'simply', 'putting', 'miles', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'perhaps', 'other', 'aspects', 'diet', 'time', 'constraints', 'motivating', 'factors', 'running', 'techniques/guidance', 'provided', 'Uta', 'hour', 'bare-bones', 'approach', 'least', 'few', 'humanitarian', 'angles', 'support', 'most', 'runners.Geared', 'towards', 'novice', 'runner', 'couch', 'potato', 'searching', 'inspiration', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'get', 'most', 'people', 'off', 'behinds', 'running', 'down', 'street']",Marathon Challenge

First, none of these ""runners"" qualified to run Boston. Think of the thousands of serious runners who train for months to run fast enough in an another Marathon simply to qualify. These people don't deserve a spot at Boston. Second, the film made a big deal about these people being able to finish the race. Some of them took 5-6 hours to complete the race. It is not right for people who haven't earned their way into the race to take up space and tie up the roads. If you can't run under 5 hours at Boston, you shouldn't run-period! It's a race. There are plenty of ""events"" available to people like these and the ""Team in Training"" types where they can pat themselves on the back for running 15 minute miles. Do that.

1113928,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B000XBPDZ8,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[7, 8]","The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest marathon, with 20,000 runners participating in 2007.  NOVA, with the help of nearby Tufts University experts and a former Boston Marathon, decided to find out if ordinary people (those who might watch, but not even think of entering) could successfully participate with only 9 months of preparation.Twelve were randomly selected from a much larger number.  First they went through basic screening to determine their fat composition (all the women were high in fat composition, though not all were overweight), and heart condition.  The latter was assessed through stress testing - one overweight (74 lbs.) woman's wave-pattern was alarming enough that doctors stopped her test.  Fortunately, after about two-weeks of preparation they decided she could proceed.  (Interesting asides - doctors pointed out that stress testing performance had a strong genetic component, and that those previously in good aerobic condition tended to remain so - even after discontinuing their exercise program.)  At this point the group include the previously mentioned considerably overweight woman, a diabetic female, a 13-year HIV veteran male, and others with shin splints and knee problems.  Ages ranged from 28 to 60.After the initial 9 weeks training one female had to drop out because of recurring stress fractures; she was replaced by a 300+ lb. former professional football lineman.  It was also interesting to learn that 90% of the participants' aerobic improvement had occurred at this point - thus, running marathons is not required to substantially improve one's physical condition.  Another interesting fact was that well-conditioned humans can outrun dogs and horses over a distance - they overheat and fade, while humans cool off more efficiently.  It was also pointed out there two types of muscles - one that responds powerfully for a short interval (eg. the football player), and another that has strong endurance (marathon runners).After five months' training the participants were going ten miles.  At the end of training it was twenty - several had problems finishing because their bodies ran out of energy (""hitting the wall"") due to not eating enough prior to and during the run.The good news was that all twelve finished the Boston Marathon itself - despite numerous aches and pains.  The bad news is that there was little change in their body fat content or weight - except for the one woman who started out 74 lbs. overweight.  She lost 45 lbs.Bottom Line:  We can do it!",5,Inspiring and Interesting!,1193788800,"10 31, 2007",2007,2521,"['Boston', 'Marathon', 'world', 'oldest', 'marathon', '20,000', 'runners', 'participating', '2007', 'NOVA', 'help', 'nearby', 'Tufts', 'University', 'experts', 'former', 'Boston', 'Marathon', 'decided', 'find', 'out', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'watch', 'not', 'even', 'think', 'entering', 'could', 'successfully', 'participate', 'only', '9', 'months', 'preparation.Twelve', 'were', 'randomly', 'selected', 'much', 'larger', 'number', 'First', 'went', 'basic', 'screening', 'determine', 'fat', 'composition', 'women', 'were', 'high', 'fat', 'composition', 'not', 'were', 'overweight', 'heart', 'condition', 'latter', 'was', 'assessed', 'stress', 'testing', 'one', 'overweight', '74', 'lbs', 'woman', 'wave-pattern', 'was', 'alarming', 'enough', 'doctors', 'stopped', 'test', 'Fortunately', 'two-weeks', 'preparation', 'decided', 'could', 'proceed', 'Interesting', 'asides', 'doctors', 'pointed', 'out', 'stress', 'testing', 'performance', 'had', 'strong', 'genetic', 'component', 'previously', 'good', 'aerobic', 'condition', 'tended', 'remain', 'so', 'even', 'discontinuing', 'exercise', 'program', 'point', 'group', 'include', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'considerably', 'overweight', 'woman', 'diabetic', 'female', '13-year', 'HIV', 'veteran', 'male', 'others', 'shin', 'splints', 'knee', 'problems', 'Ages', 'ranged', '28', '60.After', 'initial', '9', 'weeks', 'training', 'one', 'female', 'had', 'drop', 'out', 'recurring', 'stress', 'fractures', 'was', 'replaced', '300+', 'lb', 'former', 'professional', 'football', 'lineman', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'learn', '90', '%', 'participants', 'aerobic', 'improvement', 'had', 'occurred', 'point', 'thus', 'running', 'marathons', 'not', 'required', 'substantially', 'improve', 'one', 'physical', 'condition', 'interesting', 'fact', 'was', 'well-conditioned', 'humans', 'can', 'outrun', 'dogs', 'horses', 'distance', 'overheat', 'fade', 'humans', 'cool', 'off', 'more', 'efficiently', 'was', 'also', 'pointed', 'out', 'there', 'two', 'types', 'muscles', 'one', 'powerfully', 'short', 'interval', 'eg', 'football', 'player', 'strong', 'endurance', 'marathon', 'runners', '.After', 'five', 'months', 'training', 'participants', 'were', 'going', 'ten', 'miles', 'end', 'training', 'was', 'twenty', 'several', 'had', 'problems', 'finishing', 'bodies', 'ran', 'energy', 'hitting', 'wall', 'due', 'not', 'eating', 'enough', 'prior', 'run.The', 'good', 'news', 'was', 'twelve', 'finished', 'Boston', 'Marathon', 'numerous', 'aches', 'pains', 'bad', 'news', 'was', 'little', 'change', 'body', 'fat', 'content', 'weight', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'started', 'out', '74', 'lbs', 'overweight', 'lost', '45', 'lbs.Bottom', 'Line', 'can', 'do']",Marathon Challenge

1113931,A2RG6V2HH02U0M,B000XBPDZ8,Stephen Pellerine,"[1, 1]","This documentary is interesting in that it has me caught between two worlds. As a runner I like to have running DVDs and when I am not training seriously it is an OK view. On the other hand, when I am training heavily for an event I can't watch this - it kills my motivation to run well.It would have been much better if J Galloway would have led it, or if there was a more realistic aim of the video. I think that, and I may be wrong, that the kinds of runners selected for this documentary were not ideal candidates. What was the purpose? I have run several marathons - for the most part self trained - and admittedly quite a slow runner coming in around the 3: 00+ mark. These folks were trained by some of the best and came in at 5 ish hrs. Why select candidates as such? As pointed out by other reviewers - the Boston was a bad choice. This is a runners Marathon and not an experimental ground. If they were in the Boston there should have been a few sub 3:00 runners, and then you would have my attention. Also, if these runners were aiming to complete the NYC (not the Boston) it would have been better. A ""fun"" marathon should have been the aim.OK - then where was the NOVA magic? When discussing Max VO2 testing why not talk about exemplary athletes like Induran, Armstrong, Gabresalase, or Prefontaine. Where were the discussions on how training does things like increase the efficiency (and number of) mitochondria? Where were interviews with elite athletes discussing their training programs or motivation for running? Where were discussions addressing popularly held myths that running is just ""bad"" and can actually promote a lot of beneficial side effects, such as: a, b, and c?The effort fell a bit short for me as I normally love NOVA programs.
