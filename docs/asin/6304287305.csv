As a war buff with a particular fascination with World War II I was excited about the prospect of seeing a German account of the battle for Stalingrad, especially after seeing that this film is from the producers who brought us the outstanding ""Das Boot."" However, I have to say that I was really disappointed with ""Stalingrad."" This film has no business being mentioned in the same sentence as ""Saving Private Ryan"" (though at least ""Stalingrad"" does not cop out and give us a typical Hollywood heroic ending). The story itself was not very well conceived, the action scenes seem contrived and unrealistic, reminding me of war movies from fifty or sixty years ago with their unconvincing death scenes, and the acting left much to be desired. If you're interested in learning more about Stalingrad you would be much better off reading a good book about it. Even ""Enemy at the Gates,"" a movie that disappointed me tremendously, is better than this one. It pains me to say that because I really hoped ""Stalingrad"" would be a more realistic and effective account of this battle than that movie was. Making matters even worse is the ridiculous price of this DVD. I might be willing to buy this movie if I found it in the bargain bin somewhere, but it is not worth anywhere near its $32 price tag here.",3,Very disappointing,1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,1405,"['have', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'ever', 'first', 'noticed', 'sale', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'war', 'buff', 'particular', 'fascination', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'excited', 'prospect', 'seeing', 'German', 'account', 'battle', 'Stalingrad', 'especially', 'seeing', 'film', 'producers', 'who', 'brought', 'outstanding', 'Das', 'Boot', 'However', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'Stalingrad', 'film', 'business', 'being', 'mentioned', 'same', 'sentence', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'least', 'Stalingrad', 'not', 'cop', 'out', 'give', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'heroic', 'ending', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'conceived', 'action', 'scenes', 'seem', 'contrived', 'unrealistic', 'reminding', 'war', 'movies', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'years', 'ago', 'unconvincing', 'death', 'scenes', 'acting', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', ""'re"", 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'Stalingrad', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'reading', 'good', 'book', 'Even', 'Enemy', 'Gates', 'movie', 'disappointed', 'tremendously', 'better', 'one', 'say', 'really', 'hoped', 'Stalingrad', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'effective', 'account', 'battle', 'movie', 'was', 'Making', 'matters', 'even', 'worse', 'ridiculous', 'price', 'DVD', 'might', 'be', 'willing', 'buy', 'movie', 'found', 'bargain', 'bin', 'somewhere', 'not', 'worth', 'anywhere', '32', 'price', 'tag', 'here']",Stalingrad VHS

Stalingrad is probably the bloodiest battle ever fought and the stakes were certainly high, this battle marked the high water tide for the German side and the losses the Wehrmacht and the Axis forces suffered could never be recovered thus leading to the loss of the war with the Soviet Union.This being said, you would expect a much larger movie in scope, I know this is not a documentary and you should appreciate the art of the film making but I certainly did no gain a new insight on the battle after seeing it.  This is because the scope is of the battle seen from the point of view of a platoon.  We are never explained how the battle was fought and why it was lost.  The battle scenes are few and far between, I can recognize these were well crafted but they are preceded and followed by a generic moralistic story of a young commander comming to terms with handling a much more experienced platoon of soldiers and running afowl of Nazi officers who mistreat prisoners.  The officer in question tries to get help for a gravely wounded soldier in his platoon by resorting to violence, this lands him in a penal batallion (together with some members of the platoon)and has to endure starvation and penury.  Later he redeems himself by fighting against the odds with a Soviet tank column and destroying it, this is the best part of the movie. We have some side stories dealing with a child and an improbable quasi-romance with a russian woman-soldier.  In the end the platoon attempts to scape by trying to be airlifted with the wounded and failing this by trying to infiltrate the Soviet lines and trying to gain german lines through the worst possible winter conditions and in the end everybody perishes.You have to see the plight of the platoon as a representation of the suffering of all the German 6th Army.  I am a war film buff but this film somehow bored me, as I said before it needed to convey a wider spectrum of the battle, you needed to gat a feeling of the strategic implications for both sides.  In the end you get a very generic movie.  It missed a very good chance of presenting this battle as the real cataclysm it really was. I wish this story was presented with the scope for example the Market Garden Operation was presented in the film A Bridge to Far.  The Stalingrad Battle deserves a better treatment.  Even the film Enemy at the Gates misses the mark even though it portrays some very interesting aspects such as the crossing of the Volga by the Russian reinforcements, but it also lacks scope.  Overall I think Eemy at the Gates is the better of the two movies, at least on the entertainment side.",3,Minimalist View of a Great Battle,1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,2779,"['Certainly', 'interesting', 'see', 'German', 'perspective', 'WWII', 'Eastern', 'Font', 'was', 'much', 'greater', 'scope', 'even', 'importance', 'Western', 'Front', 'Stalingrad', 'probably', 'bloodiest', 'battle', 'ever', 'fought', 'stakes', 'were', 'certainly', 'high', 'battle', 'marked', 'high', 'water', 'tide', 'German', 'side', 'losses', 'Wehrmacht', 'Axis', 'forces', 'suffered', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'recovered', 'thus', 'leading', 'loss', 'war', 'Soviet', 'Union.This', 'being', 'said', 'would', 'expect', 'much', 'larger', 'movie', 'scope', 'know', 'not', 'documentary', 'should', 'appreciate', 'art', 'film', 'making', 'certainly', 'did', 'gain', 'new', 'insight', 'battle', 'seeing', 'scope', 'battle', 'seen', 'point', 'view', 'platoon', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'how', 'battle', 'was', 'fought', 'why', 'was', 'lost', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'can', 'recognize', 'were', 'well', 'crafted', 'are', 'preceded', 'followed', 'generic', 'moralistic', 'story', 'young', 'commander', 'comming', 'terms', 'handling', 'much', 'more', 'experienced', 'platoon', 'soldiers', 'running', 'afowl', 'Nazi', 'officers', 'who', 'mistreat', 'prisoners', 'officer', 'question', 'tries', 'get', 'help', 'gravely', 'wounded', 'soldier', 'platoon', 'resorting', 'violence', 'penal', 'batallion', 'together', 'members', 'platoon', 'endure', 'starvation', 'penury', 'Later', 'fighting', 'odds', 'Soviet', 'tank', 'column', 'destroying', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'have', 'side', 'stories', 'dealing', 'child', 'improbable', 'quasi-romance', 'russian', 'woman-soldier', 'end', 'platoon', 'attempts', 'scape', 'trying', 'be', 'airlifted', 'wounded', 'failing', 'trying', 'infiltrate', 'Soviet', 'lines', 'trying', 'gain', 'german', 'lines', 'worst', 'possible', 'winter', 'conditions', 'end', 'everybody', 'perishes.You', 'have', 'see', 'plight', 'platoon', 'representation', 'suffering', 'German', '6th', 'Army', 'am', 'war', 'film', 'buff', 'film', 'somehow', 'bored', 'said', 'needed', 'convey', 'wider', 'spectrum', 'battle', 'needed', 'gat', 'feeling', 'strategic', 'implications', 'sides', 'end', 'get', 'very', 'generic', 'movie', 'missed', 'very', 'good', 'chance', 'presenting', 'battle', 'real', 'cataclysm', 'really', 'was', 'wish', 'story', 'was', 'presented', 'scope', 'example', 'Market', 'Garden', 'Operation', 'was', 'presented', 'film', 'A', 'Bridge', 'Far', 'Stalingrad', 'Battle', 'better', 'treatment', 'Even', 'film', 'Enemy', 'Gates', 'mark', 'even', 'very', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'such', 'crossing', 'Volga', 'Russian', 'reinforcements', 'also', 'scope', 'Overall', 'think', 'Eemy', 'Gates', 'better', 'two', 'movies', 'least', 'entertainment', 'side']",Stalingrad VHS

The movie opens in Italy, idyllic, with German soldiers swimming,playing  in the sun. The unit then receives orders to go to the Russian front,and of course the scenic changes are brilliant.What happens in Russia is well known and though the battle scenes are graphic and well done,filled with chaos and fear,here is where the movie takes on the weightier philosophical issues,and where i think it bogs down.

412202,A3LMS2UO0ESHX5,6304287305,Albert J. Valentino,"[2, 2]","I am a huge fan of WWII movies. This movie is less about the battle and more about the men, in this case a small group of German Wehrmacht soldiers, and horror of their ordeal in the long, cold, futile battle of Stalingrad. Stalingrad is in a league of its own showing the brutal reality of this war. It is not an american movie, it does not have hollywood star power, there is no real political agenda, and there are certainly not any heros. It is what a war movie should be - allowing the viewer to see and realize the pain, suffering and erosion of hope that many soldiers endured - most other war movies focus on the glory of battle this one focuses on the gore. The final scene brings it all home as Russia's best weapon, the weather (which also defeated Napoleon), literally engulfs the last survivors of this tale and leaves one with a hollow feeling.The movie in German and English so you can pick the language, or watch in German with English subtitles. I highly recommend this movie and consider it to be one of the top WWII movies every made. Keep in mind this is a battle between Russian and German soldiers in Russia fought between the summer of 1942 and winter of 1943, there are no Americans in this battle.

Adolph Hitler's flawed strategy in the east brought about this military debacle.  The german sixth army was not well led by gen. Frederick von Paulas, he bungled the battle, by not sticking to a firm strategy in attacking the city.  The supply ferries that the russians sent across the Volga river should have been a top priority for the luftwaffe dive bombers.  The russian strategy of feeding just enough troops into the city, to forstall a german victory, while reinforcing their flanks proved to be successful.  Marshall Zhukov's encirclement operation in november of 1942, caught the germans by complete surprise.  The army should have been withdrwan at that point, it was still possible to do so.  Goring's folly in insisting that he could supply sixth army by air, was an empty boast.  The sixth army was left to its fate, after Gen. Manstein's attempt to break through to the trapped army.  It was a sad end to a military force that deserved better treatment fron its high command.  In the end Hitler shoulders much of the blame.  But the ordinary german soldier is the one who paid the price for the mistakes of the german high command.

412206,A3SH2Z6PZ5XBXR,6304287305,A reader,"[10, 12]","This movie, portraying the battle for Stalingrad from the German point of view was fairly entertaining and, of course, cruelly graphic in many parts.  As a student of history myself and fairly familiar with the fighting on the Eastern Front, I found many of the inaccuracies and downright distortions of what really happened somewhat disappointing.Firstly, the movie seems to go out of its way to show the average German soldier to be generally insolent, defiant and cynical.  In the opening scenes, at an awards presentation in Italy, several of the main characters arrive late(!) and then, as medals are being awarded, one of the soldiers, a sergeant named Rohleder, is blatantly disrespectful to his commanding officer forcing the senior officer presiding to revoke the sergeant's award.  Surely, in reality, such behaviour, in front of an entire courtyard of soldiers and officers no less, would have been punished much more severely than that, possibly with a spell in the stockade or immediate demotion in rank.Next, we see enlisted men laughing at their commanding officer while riding through Russia in a rail car.  Sergeant Rohleder again shows his insolence when he bets the Lieutenant in charge, a Lieutenant von Witzland, that he will survive the war while the Lieutenant will not - offering a mere case of water as 'payment' should he lose.  Perhaps the most shockingly inaccurate scene is when Lieutenant von Witzland later sees a German security man beat a Russian prisoner to death.  He tries to intervene but instead is knocked to the ground.  As he lay in a puddle of muddy water, other German soldiers merely step around him while his own company continues to march off as though nothing has happened.  In reality, this security man would have immediately been seized and arrested, more than likely by the Lieutenant's own men.  Further, this security man would also have been severely punished, possibly even executed, not only for beating a Russian prisoner to death but for striking an officer in the process.Another distortion can be seen during close combat in a ruined factory when von Witzland is shown, after a disturbing encounter with a wounded Russian soldier, heaving and crying hysterically in front of his men, even bemoaning the fact that the incident made him 's*** in his pants' because he 'couldn't control it'.  With such behaviour guaranteed to shake the confidence of the troops under him, this Lieutenant would have been quickly relieved of duty for showing such a blatant lack of courage and fortitude in battle.Other scenes that are worth mentioning for their downright bias if not inaccurate portrayal:  a soldier shown shaking his head in disgust while fellow troops listen to Hitler giving a speech on the radio, von Witzland jumping up and abruptly shutting off the same broadcast, Russian troops scurrying about a courtyard attempting to 'pick up their wounded' during a lull in the fighting - something rare bordering on the preposterous for Soviet troops seldom showed such humanity to their wounded.  In fact, if they were poking around amongst piles of dead and wounded it would only be to gather up weapons and ammunition - certainly not to administer first aid nor comfort to the dying.  And if that wasn't ridiculous enough, this same scene is followed by von Witzland arranging a truce so all could come out of hiding and assist their wounded together.  Of course in actuality, the Russians may very well have agreed to a truce but only to lure the naive Lieutenant and his men out into the open so they could be quickly gunned down.Such was the savagery of war on the Eastern Front which, it would seem, was too much even for the writers and producers to portray.  But, then again, I suppose a movie about Soviet savagery and brutality in Stalingrad, or anywhere else on the Eastern Front for that matter, is just not a politically correct nor sexy enough subject for the big screen. As we are all conditioned to believe, the Germans make much better villains.Notice especially the scene showing German soldiers in retreat, burning down Russian villages and driving the inhabitants out into the cold.  It was, however, common knowledge that, in reality, doing so made little tactical sense, the smoke often alerting the Russians to the German intentions and very likely provoking an immediate counterattack.  Since the burning of entire villages and execution of many of its inhabitants was often a mark of the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, which generally torched all dwellings to deprive Germans troops of warmth and shelter, it is rather strange but not entirely unexpected that the producers chose to deliberately ignore this.  As well, civilians who dared to resist such attempts by the NKVD were almost always shot on the spot, while the rest were driven off into the surrounding woodlands with no food, water nor protection from the winter weather.I could go on but I think what I have indicated is enough to illustrate that this movie is hardly an accurate portrayal of the actual battle of Stalingrad especially regarding the training and fortitude of the average German soldier.  Rather, it is an attempt to show the German as brutal, pitiful, undisciplined, insolent and disloyal.As any historian will no doubt admit, nothing could be further from the truth.",3,Good But Not So

However, good intentions do not necessarily lead to a good picture.The film opened in Germany 50 years  after the devastating defeat of the sixth German army in Stalingrad. To  avoid any misunderstandings, the film tried to convey one simple message.  WAR IS HELL !  Of course, it is, but unfortunately, the film is far too  clumsy and obvious to get this message across. There is really no  ambivalence in the entire picture. The viewer is never allowed to think for  himself. Director Joseph Vilsmeier bangs everything into your head over and  over again until the last one gets it. Only officers are evil, the soldiers  are all victims. Surely it was not that easy. Norbert Schneider's score is  another weakness, since it is far too bombastic. The only assets are the  good performances and the high technical level of the picture.If you  want to see a great german war movie, watch Bernhard Wicki's &quot;Die  Br&uuml;cke&quot; (The Bridge) or Wolfgang Petersen's &quot;Das Boot&quot; (The  Boat) instead.

It starts with the unit on R&R; in Italy. Ten minutes into the film the unit has suffered 90 percent casualties and their plight goes down hill from there.There are numerous scenes that portray the brutality of that particular battle, and by inference all of the war on the eastern front. As in Das Boot, all pretense of glory and honor is blown away. The scene where the protagonist, formerly an idealist , fakes injury in order to be medially evacuated really hits hard. The film seems to lose its way after that.The scenes with the well supplied officer and his captured love slave (who is the same gal the protagonist encountered earlier in the sewers) really goes overboard.The film makes no apologies and offers no rationalization.  This is a common theme of blaming the insanity of combat on the officers, but in this case it rings false. The wehrmacht captain who floats in and out of the story is probably more realistically portrayed. His line that ""he owed us that"" after one of his soldiers is sacrificed for marginal gain reflects a grim pragmatism that the wehrmacht faced as they experienced defeat upon defeat.All in all a depressing but important work on the second world war.",4,Das Boot on land,1030406400,"08 27, 2002",2002,1320,"['gut', 'wrenching', 'depiction', 'German', 'army', 'defeat', 'Stalingrad', 'film', 'elite', 'unit', 'German', 'strom', 'troops', 'unit', 'R', 'R', 'Italy', 'Ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'unit', 'suffered', '90', 'percent', 'casualties', 'plight', 'down', 'hill', 'are', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'portray', 'brutality', 'particular', 'battle', 'inference', 'war', 'eastern', 'front', 'Das', 'Boot', 'pretense', 'glory', 'honor', 'blown', 'away', 'scene', 'where', 'protagonist', 'formerly', 'idealist', 'fakes', 'injury', 'order', 'be', 'medially', 'evacuated', 'really', 'hard', 'film', 'lose', 'way', 'that.The', 'scenes', 'well', 'supplied', 'officer', 'captured', 'love', 'slave', 'who', 'same', 'gal', 'protagonist', 'encountered', 'earlier', 'sewers', 'really', 'overboard.The', 'film', 'apologies', 'rationalization', 'common', 'theme', 'blaming', 'insanity', 'combat', 'officers', 'case', 'false', 'wehrmacht', 'captain', 'who', 'story', 'probably', 'more', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'line', 'owed', 'one', 'soldiers', 'sacrificed', 'marginal', 'gain', 'grim', 'pragmatism', 'wehrmacht', 'faced', 'experienced', 'defeat', 'defeat.All', 'depressing', 'important', 'work', 'second', 'world', 'war']",Stalingrad VHS

Ironically, the raw realism which drew rave  reviews for SPR had elicited little more than horror and negativity for  &quot;Stalingrad&quot;.  I'm not a sadistic guts'n'gore affictionado, but  war is brutal and needs to be presented in an unsanitized manner.  &quot;Stalingrad&quot; has been, and remains, my favorite war film.  It is  from the German producers of &quot;Das Boot&quot;, and presents the point  of view of the common Wehrmacht soldiers of Paulus' 6th Army, who were  abandoned to freeze or be slaughtered in the bombed-out ruins of the city  named for Stalin.  Neither the Germans nor the Russians are portrayed as  heroes or supermen in this film; there is only the desperation of fighters  who are forbidden retreat.  The anti-Nazi views of the producers are  well-known, and occasionally a bit heavy-handed, but there is an admirable  attempt to stick to realism.  Even the Russians are presented accurately:  from the presence of the female corpsman (yes, there were thousands of  Russian women combatants at Stalingrad), to the playing of the phonograph  song Temnaya Noch', to Stalin's cruel Edict that &quot;there are no POW's  -- only deserters&quot;.  The tense ceasefires to allow tending of the  wounded are also historically accurate, and are documented in various  memoirs. The T-34 tank model depicted is, unfortunately, an anacronism.  But the hand-to-hand fighting through the rubble of the buildings, streets,  and sewers is realistic.  As is the freezing Russian winter which sapped  the energy and morale of the stranded Germans reduced to scurrying like  rats and eating their own horses.  From the cavalier attitudes of the  would-be conquerers on the train to the desperation of the hordes of  would-be escapees at the airport, this film takes us along with these  German soldiers, allowing us to sympathize with their plight and even form  a certain detached liking for them.  The futility of their campaign haunts  the poignant, sorrowful ending of the film (one can't call it a climax), as  Russia Herself swallows her violators.",5,My &quot;favorite&quot; war film,955238400,"04 9, 2000",2000,2221,"['was', 'quot', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'quot', 'most', 'graphic', 'visceral', 'cinematic', 'battlefield', 'carnage', 'was', 'depicted', 'quot', 'Stalingrad', 'quot', 'Ironically', 'raw', 'realism', 'drew', 'rave', 'reviews', 'SPR', 'had', 'elicited', 'little', 'more', 'horror', 'negativity', 'quot', 'Stalingrad', 'quot', ""'m"", 'not', 'sadistic', 'guts', ""n'gore"", 'affictionado', 'war', 'brutal', 'be', 'presented', 'unsanitized', 'manner', 'quot', 'Stalingrad', 'quot', 'been', 'favorite', 'war', 'film', 'German', 'producers', 'quot', 'Das', 'Boot', 'quot', 'point', 'view', 'common', 'Wehrmacht', 'soldiers', 'Paulus', '6th', 'Army', 'who', 'were', 'abandoned', 'freeze', 'be', 'slaughtered', 'bombed-out', 'ruins', 'city', 'named', 'Stalin', 'Germans', 'Russians', 'are', 'portrayed', 'heroes', 'supermen', 'film', 'only', 'desperation', 'fighters', 'who', 'are', 'forbidden', 'retreat', 'anti-Nazi', 'views', 'producers', 'are', 'well-known', 'occasionally', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'admirable', 'attempt', 'stick', 'realism', 'Even', 'Russians', 'are', 'presented', 'accurately', 'presence', 'female', 'corpsman', 'yes', 'were', 'thousands', 'Russian', 'women', 'combatants', 'Stalingrad', 'playing', 'phonograph', 'song', 'Temnaya', 'Noch', 'Stalin', 'cruel', 'Edict', 'quot', 'are', 'POW', 'only', 'quot', 'tense', 'allow', 'tending', 'wounded', 'are', 'also', 'historically', 'accurate', 'are', 'documented', 'various', 'memoirs', 'T-34', 'tank', 'model', 'depicted', 'unfortunately', 'anacronism', 'hand-to-hand', 'fighting', 'rubble', 'buildings', 'streets', 'sewers', 'realistic', 'freezing', 'Russian', 'winter', 'sapped', 'energy', 'morale', 'stranded', 'Germans', 'reduced', 'scurrying', 'rats', 'eating', 'own', 'horses', 'cavalier', 'attitudes', 'would-be', 'conquerers', 'train', 'desperation', 'hordes', 'would-be', 'escapees', 'airport', 'film', 'German', 'soldiers', 'allowing', 'sympathize', 'plight', 'even', 'form', 'certain', 'detached', 'liking', 'futility', 'campaign', 'poignant', 'sorrowful', 'ending', 'film', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'climax', 'Russia', 'Herself', 'violators']",Stalingrad VHS

Besieged by the Germans for months, the bitterly contested city looks appropriately as if it's been hit by an atomic bomb. The film relates not only how hard both the Germans and Russians fought over this city, but how the cruel Russian Winter exacerbated the situation and made the Germans' attempt futile.The acting is very good in this film. We aren't meant to be sympathetic to the German soldiers. They are merely cogs in the Nazi war machine. Fallible characters who show both courage and cowardice in the process of the story. I found that it was best to watch the movie in its native German with English subtitles. You get a better feel for the emotional content of the words that are spoken, even if you are not fluent in the language.The production values are excellent, as are the sets and costumes. This film, to my knowledge, is thoroughly convincing and makes you feel as if you've been drawn into the era to witness the terrible battle as it nears its conclusion. At the end, we see the beginnings of the terrible march to Siberia by German prisoners. Only five percent survived, but I'm sure the Russians would have been satisfied had none of them made the trip.The only thing I might have wanted to see was a bit more of the perspective of the Russian troops, but I guess that might have made a long film a bit too long.Truly an unforgiving and brutal anti-war film and not to be missed!",5,"Stark, unforgiving look at the horrors of war",992822400,"06 18, 2001",2001,1486,"['Stalingrad', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'visceral', 'look', 'horrors', 'war', 'Besieged', 'Germans', 'months', 'bitterly', 'contested', 'city', 'appropriately', 'been', 'hit', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'hard', 'Germans', 'Russians', 'fought', 'city', 'how', 'cruel', 'Russian', 'Winter', 'exacerbated', 'situation', 'made', 'Germans', 'attempt', 'futile.The', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'German', 'soldiers', 'are', 'merely', 'cogs', 'Nazi', 'war', 'machine', 'Fallible', 'characters', 'who', 'show', 'courage', 'cowardice', 'process', 'story', 'found', 'was', 'best', 'watch', 'movie', 'native', 'German', 'English', 'subtitles', 'get', 'better', 'feel', 'emotional', 'content', 'words', 'are', 'spoken', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'fluent', 'language.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'sets', 'costumes', 'film', 'knowledge', 'thoroughly', 'convincing', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'drawn', 'era', 'witness', 'terrible', 'battle', 'conclusion', 'end', 'see', 'beginnings', 'terrible', 'march', 'Siberia', 'German', 'prisoners', 'Only', 'five', 'percent', 'survived', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Russians', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'satisfied', 'had', 'none', 'made', 'trip.The', 'only', 'thing', 'might', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'perspective', 'Russian', 'troops', 'guess', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'long', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'long.Truly', 'unforgiving', 'brutal', 'anti-war', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Stalingrad VHS

The fact that it is a German film makes this accurate portrayal even more important.The anti-war moralizing scenes also at times grow weary.

Director Vilsmaier's cameras are always at ground level to  establish intimacy.The attention to detail is also remarkable. Authentic  weapons, uniforms, vehicles, setting and buildings, you name it. In this  way, it is very similar to both Das Boot and Saving Private Ryan. Some  folks question the use of newer T-34/85 Russian tanks in the film as  opposed to the older T-34/76 models. I think it should be understood that  the Germans, both on offense and in retreat, destroyed Russian armor in  great numbers, and it is unlikely that older serveable tanks have survived.  The T-34/85 was in use long after WW2 ended.What lets the film down  somewhat is its portrayal of German senior officers as sadistic martinets,  bereft of any humanity or compassion. Yet the Russians are portrayed often  as helpless, innocent and frightened victims, quite an oversimplification  considering the reality of the Eastern Front during WW2.But scenes of  soldiers caught in the frigid, snowy landscapes of Stalingrad are  unforgetable. It cecomes evident that it was the winter, the worst in 100  years, that defeated the Germans, not the Russians. The ending of the film  with Fritz and Von Witzland huddled and dying in the driving snow is  profoundly sad.Just some comments about the DVD. All you get are basic  features; theatrical trailer, brief bio's and language selection. The video  quality is ok, but not remarkable.

Some of the battlefield effects are a little cheesy and a few things bothered me about the tactics used in the film.  (For example in the film the stormtroopers charged down the streets into machinegun fire.  In the real battle they would advance inside the buildings blasting through walls if necessary.)  The tanks depicted were real soviet tanks but a version T-34/85 that wasn't available until after the battle of Stalingrad.  Inspite of the films shortcomings it was a very entertaining film and I thought it depicted the desperation felt by the men in the surrounded sixth army.  The film works emotionally because it gets you to sympathize with the German soldiers, then worry and suffer with them.  Then you feel hope for them as they try to escape from the surrounded city.  Only to have that hope dashed when they are killed or freeze to death.  This allows you as the viewer to feel a little of what the actual soldiers in the battle felt.  This is why this is a good film.

If you have any interest in WW2 and want to see what it was really like on the eastern front in brutal Stalingrad Russia, then this is the movie to see. It feels real and is a complete mightmare, but you can;t take your eyes off the screen. Its like a great novel, with visual intensity. The acting and directing of this German film are top shelf. Its almost like they don't know the cameras are rolling, and it really is 1940's Russia.It starts off so well for the Germans, as we see them celebrating a rare day off from the horrors of war in Italy. They are fresh off a victory in North Africa and are to be deployed in Russia to take over the vital supply line that Stalingrad affords its Russian forces.As soon as the fighting begins the horror takes ahold of the German platoon. You can see the looks on their faces scene after scene, when they begin to realize that this is one battle that is not going to be victorious. To further hamper the the grim reality of their surroundings the winter soon takes an icy grip on the unit as well as a beginning hatred for their superior officers. This is one of the interesting aspects of this film. They seem to hate the officers as much as their enemy. And the officers being to lose command and control of the platoon, as they try deperately to intimidate the men to see things ""the fuhrer's way"".Cold and ominous, this film has the exact feeling you would expect for this battle,  and circumstance. 5 stars - probably the best war film of all time.",5,Stalingrad- or the end of the line for many,1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,1581,"['movie', 'one', 'greatest', 'war', 'movies', 'ever', 'not', 'over-', 'statement', 'have', 'interest', 'WW2', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'eastern', 'front', 'brutal', 'Stalingrad', 'Russia', 'then', 'movie', 'see', 'real', 'complete', 'mightmare', 'can', 't', 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'great', 'novel', 'visual', 'intensity', 'acting', 'directing', 'German', 'film', 'are', 'top', 'shelf', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'cameras', 'are', 'rolling', 'really', '1940', 'Russia.It', 'so', 'well', 'Germans', 'see', 'celebrating', 'rare', 'day', 'horrors', 'war', 'Italy', 'are', 'fresh', 'victory', 'North', 'Africa', 'are', 'be', 'deployed', 'Russia', 'take', 'over', 'vital', 'supply', 'line', 'Stalingrad', 'affords', 'Russian', 'forces.As', 'soon', 'fighting', 'horror', 'ahold', 'German', 'platoon', 'can', 'see', 'looks', 'scene', 'scene', 'when', 'begin', 'realize', 'one', 'battle', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'victorious', 'further', 'hamper', 'grim', 'reality', 'surroundings', 'winter', 'soon', 'icy', 'grip', 'unit', 'as', 'well', 'beginning', 'hatred', 'superior', 'officers', 'one', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'film', 'seem', 'hate', 'officers', 'as', 'much', 'enemy', 'officers', 'being', 'lose', 'command', 'control', 'platoon', 'try', 'deperately', 'intimidate', 'men', 'see', 'things', 'fuhrer', 'way', '.Cold', 'ominous', 'film', 'exact', 'feeling', 'would', 'expect', 'battle', 'circumstance', '5', 'stars', 'probably', 'best', 'war', 'film', 'time']",Stalingrad VHS

I think almost every one knows why Stalingrad had been so memorable name in the annals of History. This was the war which was considered to be the most bloody and brutal war of 21st Century. This is where Germans had started to lose the war and their complete 6th Army was annihilated.`Stalingrad' starts with the story of a German company which gets redeployed from El Alamein Campaign (North Africa) to Stalingrad to push back the Russian Offence. We get introduced to some of the men who will be there through out the movie and we see the confrontation through their eyes. For the most part, the characters which was most unforgettable to me was the battle hardened Corporal Fritz Reiser (enacted by Dominique Horwitz) and the inexperienced idealistic Platoon Leader Lieutenant Von Witzland (brilliantly performed by Thomas Kretschmann).As said earlier this Movie has only two major battle scenes, one happens within the Factory Compound at Stalingrad and the other one is a well portrayed Soviet Mixed Tank Infantry Offence on a prepared German Positions. Action scenes were well executed and since there was less amount of CGI it was realistic. Note this movie was five years prior to `Saving Private Ryan' and taking into consideration that I would say the special effects were really good. For couple of times I have mentioned SPR* because I think when it comes to absolute realistic graphic violence SPR * has benchmarked the Movie Industry how a War Movie should be depicted.Overall this movie will be enjoyed by those who like Genre based on Second World War.* Saving Private Ryan",4,Unforgettable,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,2333,"['think', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'subject', 'Movie', 'Making.Ever', 'movies', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'new', 'techniques', 'uphold', 'gritty', 'images', 'brutality', 'War.Past', 'always', 'romanticized', 'subject', 'World', 'War', 'pre', 'Spielberg', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan.Well', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'shown', 'story', 'Allies', 'POV.It', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movies', 'Downfall', 'Stalingrad', 'really', 'gave', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'other', 'side.', 'Stalingrad', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'War', 'Drama', 'rather', 'only', 'action', 'oriented', 'Movie.More', 'aspect', 'been', 'given', 'humane', 'elements', 'make', 'more', 'memorable', 'think', 'almost', 'one', 'why', 'Stalingrad', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'memorable', 'name', 'annals', 'History', 'was', 'war', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'most', 'bloody', 'brutal', 'war', '21st', 'Century', 'where', 'Germans', 'had', 'started', 'lose', 'war', 'complete', '6th', 'Army', 'was', 'annihilated.', 'Stalingrad', 'story', 'German', 'company', 'redeployed', 'El', 'Alamein', 'Campaign', 'North', 'Africa', 'Stalingrad', 'push', 'back', 'Russian', 'Offence', 'get', 'introduced', 'men', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'out', 'movie', 'see', 'confrontation', 'eyes', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'was', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'was', 'battle', 'hardened', 'Corporal', 'Fritz', 'Reiser', 'enacted', 'Dominique', 'Horwitz', 'inexperienced', 'idealistic', 'Platoon', 'Leader', 'Lieutenant', 'Von', 'Witzland', 'brilliantly', 'performed', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', '.As', 'said', 'earlier', 'Movie', 'only', 'two', 'major', 'battle', 'scenes', 'one', 'Factory', 'Compound', 'Stalingrad', 'other', 'one', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Soviet', 'Mixed', 'Tank', 'Infantry', 'Offence', 'prepared', 'German', 'Positions', 'Action', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'executed', 'was', 'less', 'amount', 'CGI', 'was', 'realistic', 'Note', 'movie', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'prior', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'taking', 'consideration', 'would', 'say', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'couple', 'times', 'have', 'mentioned', 'SPR*', 'think', 'when', 'absolute', 'realistic', 'graphic', 'violence', 'SPR', '*', 'benchmarked', 'Movie', 'Industry', 'how', 'War', 'Movie', 'should', 'be', 'depicted.Overall', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'who', 'like', 'Genre', 'based', 'Second', 'World', 'War', '*', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan']",Stalingrad VHS

Stalingrad does so with exceptional cinematography and casting, focusing on a new Wehrmacht (Heer) Lieutentant's first experience at the front, and his interactions with his Captain, Sergeant, Corporal, and Privates.  If you have heard of and imagined what the &quot;Ostfront&quot; or &quot;Eastern Front&quot; might have been like, this is the movie to see.  It puts the carnage of our own recent films of the U.S. Civil War, senselessly bloody attempts to &quot;take&quot; terrain, or in this case, a city, building by building, in another context.  It puts to you directly the eternal question:  why war?  I cannot answer the question, we know why German territorial expansion became World War Two.  But to those involved in the expansion, what did it really mean?

Can we learn something here that will avert repetition elsewhere, as we may be destined to go?  Hopefully, that answer is yes.

I found the German soldiers to be faithfully represented in everything from their haircuts to their equipment, and their weapons. Unlike Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, in which the Germans were portrayed in a manner not truthfully represented for history's sake, the movie Stalingrad is an excellent account of a very small slice of one of the most brutal battles in World War Two. Of course it has anti-war overtones which are apparent throughout the movie, and become even more so near the end, climaxing in the snow drifts of a brutal Russian Winter, we find the Sixth army trapped and surrounded by the Russian soldiers, who are accurately portrayed, and who take a secondary role to the dialog of the disintegrating German Army and soldats who star in this film.  The themes of brutality, discipline to the end, starvation, and disease take the viewer through the horror of war, and its trials and tribulations of friendships ripped apart by senseless murder, and the agony of the wounded soldiers, some with missing limbs and horrible wounds.To be a little critical, I did find some scenes confusing, and the segway between scenes also a little confusing.

Too much human  interest and the viewer eventually expects to see John Wayne saunter into  picture dressed as a German general with a broad American accent toting  shotguns and smoking cigars.The most successful marriage of the two  remains The World At War -largely because the cameras gave you the picture  and Olivier broke your heart with his narration. Spielberg almost cracked  it in Saving Private Ryan with a searing first 20 minutes and then blew it  in the last 20 by turning Tom Hanks into a WW2 version of Indiana Jones -  holding off crack SS troops ( they were resting and refitting in France  after service on the Eastern Front and would have polished off his crew  with hands tied behind their backs ) in a display I have not seen since a B  grade matinee in the 60's. To say nothing of the laboured attention to the  fateful role played by the previously released prisoner.Stalingrad is  riddled with inaccuracies and corn. The dialogue is stilted and wooden.  Many of the situations were contrived. And throughout the actors remained  relatively well groomed and well fed.

412235,A328S9RN3U5M68,6304287305,Grady Harp,"[6, 6]","STALINGRAD , released in 1993, remains one of the most brutally honest depictions of war on film. A brief history of the facts behind this film have been well stated: 'The Battle of Stalingrad was a major battle of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in southwestern Russia. It took place between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943, and is often cited as the turning point of the war in Europe. The German offensive to take Stalingrad, the battle inside the city and the Soviet counter-offensive--which eventually trapped and destroyed the German 6th Army and other Axis forces around the city--was the first substantial German land defeat of the war. The battle involved more participants than any other on the Eastern Front, and was marked by its brutality and disregard for military and civilian casualties by both sides. It was amongst the bloodiest in the history of warfare, with the upper estimates of combined casualties coming to nearly two million.'  The horror of this battle as written by J&uuml;rgen B&uuml;scher, Christoph Fromm, Johannes Heide, and director Joseph Vilsmaier manages to allow us to see the 'other side' of the German forces, those not committed to the Nazi hunger for world domination, but instead were simply men serving their required time in the army, hoping to return to their families.The film opens with a prelude:  German troops of the 6th Army are languishing in Italy after their successful mission in North Africa.  They are soon assigned to attack a port in Russia - a place called Stalingrad - and off they go to what is perceived to be another quick victory.  The unit is directed by Lt. Hans von Witzland (Thomas Kretschmann, in a role that should have won him every award possible, so fine is his performance): he is a man who appears more human than soldier and indeed when his troop arrives in Russian territory he is appalled by the treatment of Russian POWs by German officers, a response that places him in a negative light with the Nazis. But Witzland is assigned to take a Russian strong hold with the close help of his group of fellow soldiers (played with extraordinary humanity by Dominique Horwitz, Sebastian Rudolph, Oliver Broumis et al).  For a moment in time they are successful heroes but their commitment to the war is rapidly and fully eroded by the slaughter around them and the orders from the heinous Nazi officers to treat the Russians with less than dignity.  They are threatened with death by firing squad for their humanity in attempting to give aid to the Russians being constantly attacked and only released form their prisoner status when the war appears to be aimed toward loss. There are many very tender moments between the 6th army and the Russians trapped by the siege of Stalingrad and as the bitter winter sets in the battle-weary soldiers are dying, committing suicide or attempting to escape and find their way back home.  The over two hour study of the cruelty of war ends with a solemn statement, both emotionally and visually and the Battle of Stalingrad, a victory of the Russians, shows the defeat of the minds (and lives) of the Germans.The film is brave in its commitment to address the fact that the universal 'German image' of World War II is a negative one. This film focuses on individual ideals and the scarring that war, on both sides, leaves on the soldiers and people who survive it.  Highly recommended.

Wolfgang Petersen, 1981; Dir. cut, 1997) again paints a human face on Hitler's war machine with this gut retching film: Stalingrad. The film follows a platoon of German ""Stormtroopers"" from a comfortable R & R on the Mediterranean to the horrors of the Russian front. The result is an anti-war message every bit as powerful as All Quiet on the Western Front.The film's protagonist is a young lieutenant (Thomas Kretschmann) sent to replace the former platoon officer who was wounded in action. He is not a die-hard Nazi, however, initially he is full of discipline and military bearing. As in other films of this genre, the young officer soon finds that military protocol as well as gentlemanly rules of war do not apply in combat, particularly on the Russian front. After the first major battle for the tractor factory, the story begins to focus on the ever dwindling platoon. The nucleus of which consists of the Lieutenant, Fritz (Dominique Horwitz), the sergeant (Joachim Nickel), and a raw recruit Gege (Sabastian Rudolph). The group soon finds themselves fighting both the enemy and an officer corp bent on carrying out Hitler's futile orders at any cost. The latter is exemplified in a corrupt Captain (Karl Hermanck) who acts as the film's villain.The main theme of the film is survival. Unlike Das Boot, there is no sense of daring adventure among the platoon, only hopes of returning to Germany alive. The battle scenes are exciting and realistic. The scene where six authentic Russian T-34 tanks attack the dug-in platoon on a frozen steppe is well done, although the film makers included far too few Russian infantry for protection. There is enough severed limbs and blood on the snow to add realism. One gruesome scene in particular during the tank attack, a German soldier accidentally runs in the path of an anti-tank round and is completely cut in two. He lives long enough to view the lower half of his body lying next to his bloody torso.  After the Germans are completely surrounded and cut off from all food and supplies, the last remaining four survivors realize they are doomed to either languish in Siberia or die. They decide, with the help of a female Russian soldier to escape the encirclement themselves. The ending will surprise those who have been drawn to the last four members of the platoon. The film achieves its aim of showing how political ideology is absent from the battlefield. One has to almost be reminded that the cannon fodder at Stalingrad represented two totalitarian regimes that condoned terror and murder on an unprecedented scale. Originally in German with English subtitles, the DVD offers an English dub that is not distracting.

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[12, 14]","This film is unlike almost every other epic and acclaimed war film in that there seems to be a true shortage of characters we can feel empathy towards. Edification rather than entertainment comes with the viewing of this film as does a growing feeling of disgust as ""Stalingrad"" grinds on. We see little from the viewpoint of the Russian soldier or civilian, but this isn't their story. The depictions of equipment, weapons and uniforms appears to be very accurate and the soldiers seem to be well cast in their roles.If you want to see a film that most viscerally depicts the horror and carnage of war from the vewpoint of the conquering army facing its own inevitable downfall, then ""Stalingrad"" is your film. Frankly, the anti-nazi, anti-facist sentiments that are brought up by the German soldiers from time to time seem to be addressing the pro-facist sentiment that seemed to be incubating during the 1980s and 1990s more than what was happening at Stalingrad in 1942-43. Suffice it to say that NOT every German was Pro-Nazi during the war.Nevertheless, concentrating on how 1 company of German Storm Troopers dealt with this most horrific battle of attrition does help give a face to this battle, from out of the history texts, directly onto our screens, and aids in making so enormous a topic more manageable in scope. By the end of the film, with the German infantrymen either extinct or on their way to oblivion, we do clearly see the insanity of war which is obviously the goal of this film.MY SUBJECTIVE THOUGHTS ON ""STALINGRAD"":This is a bleak depressing story and is told in that manner. It is also a film that I don't feel like seeing again anytime soon. However, ""Das Boot"" was also such a story, was made with many of the same production people yet I find myself repeatedly viewing ""Das Boot"" in the extended version in both English and German on DVD. I watched the video so many times that I wore it out. In other words, ""Stalingrad"" is a film that has ""high production values"" and ""high historic importance"" and it is about a topic I am very interested in, but I don't feel any desire to see this film again. It probably comes back to the lack of sympathetic characters among the German soldiers which was not the case in ""Das Boot"". I always feel devastated at the end of ""Das Boot"" at the sight of the Captain dying and the U-boat sinking in its home berth from a sudden unexpected air raid. When ""Stalingrad"" was finally over [and its much shorter than Das Boot] I felt relieved.ABOUT THE RECORDING:This video is ""Widescreen"" and dubbed in English.",4,A BRUTAL GRUNT EYE'S VIEW OF HELL ON EARTH,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,2570,"['film', 'almost', 'other', 'epic', 'acclaimed', 'war', 'film', 'be', 'true', 'shortage', 'characters', 'can', 'feel', 'empathy', 'towards', 'Edification', 'rather', 'entertainment', 'viewing', 'film', 'growing', 'feeling', 'disgust', 'Stalingrad', 'see', 'little', 'viewpoint', 'Russian', 'soldier', 'civilian', ""n't"", 'story', 'depictions', 'equipment', 'weapons', 'uniforms', 'be', 'very', 'accurate', 'soldiers', 'seem', 'be', 'well', 'cast', 'roles.If', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'most', 'viscerally', 'horror', 'carnage', 'war', 'vewpoint', 'conquering', 'army', 'facing', 'own', 'inevitable', 'downfall', 'then', 'Stalingrad', 'film', 'Frankly', 'anti-nazi', 'anti-facist', 'sentiments', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'German', 'soldiers', 'time', 'time', 'seem', 'be', 'addressing', 'pro-facist', 'sentiment', 'seemed', 'be', 'incubating', '1980s', '1990s', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Stalingrad', '1942-43', 'Suffice', 'say', 'NOT', 'German', 'was', 'Pro-Nazi', 'war.Nevertheless', 'concentrating', 'how', '1', 'company', 'German', 'Storm', 'Troopers', 'dealt', 'most', 'horrific', 'battle', 'attrition', 'help', 'give', 'face', 'battle', 'history', 'texts', 'directly', 'screens', 'aids', 'making', 'so', 'enormous', 'topic', 'more', 'manageable', 'scope', 'end', 'film', 'German', 'infantrymen', 'extinct', 'way', 'oblivion', 'do', 'clearly', 'see', 'insanity', 'war', 'obviously', 'goal', 'film.MY', 'SUBJECTIVE', 'THOUGHTS', 'ON', 'STALINGRAD', 'bleak', 'depressing', 'story', 'told', 'manner', 'also', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'seeing', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon', 'However', 'Das', 'Boot', 'was', 'also', 'such', 'story', 'was', 'made', 'many', 'same', 'production', 'people', 'yet', 'find', 'repeatedly', 'viewing', 'Das', 'Boot', 'extended', 'version', 'English', 'German', 'DVD', 'watched', 'video', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'wore', 'out', 'other', 'words', 'Stalingrad', 'film', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'high', 'historic', 'importance', 'topic', 'am', 'very', 'interested', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'desire', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'probably', 'back', 'lack', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'German', 'soldiers', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'Das', 'Boot', 'always', 'feel', 'devastated', 'end', 'Das', 'Boot', 'sight', 'Captain', 'dying', 'U-boat', 'sinking', 'home', 'berth', 'sudden', 'unexpected', 'air', 'raid', 'When', 'Stalingrad', 'was', 'finally', '[', 'much', 'shorter', 'Das', 'Boot', ']', 'felt', 'relieved.ABOUT', 'THE', 'RECORDING', 'video', 'Widescreen', 'dubbed', 'English']",Stalingrad VHS

The other recent film about this battle, *Enemy at the Gate* is a slicker production with a bigger budget and recognizable stars.  But it catches only brief glimpses of the situation's intractable desperation.  *Stalingrad* packs more emotion and spirit, its protagonists more real, more flesh and blood than *EATG*.  There is no romantic subplot to distract from the Germans' struggle against their two inevitable foes---the Russian soldier and the Russian winter.As they change from an elite and well-equipped Storm Trooper unit to becoming a rag-tag band of starving deserters, they  search for a safe haven in a world where everything else is the enemy.The squad unsuccessfully grapples with contradiction while Humanity takes a backseat to the German War Machine.  One message is made clear:  the German soldiers possess far more compassion than the Nazis.*Stalingrad* has lots of blood and guts a la *Saving Private Ryan*. Although Stalingrad's battle-gore FX are far less realistic than those employed by SPR, it's not for the squeamish viewer.My sons and I were emotionally affected by this film.

Both films begin  with the principal actors in leisure time so we get to know them  immediately. It worked in &quot;Das Boot,&quot; so I guess they figured,  &quot;Why not again?&quot; Frankly, I thought it was lazy filmmaking. (As a  comparison, establishing scenes for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;  characters don't occur until after the first half-hour.) I was surprisingly  detached from the characters of the film. The fighting scenes were all  fine, but the camera selections during the scene in the ruins were jumbled  and incoherant. This diminished any shock value that might have occurred if  the intensity had been cranked up. There was little of the urgency I've  seen in movies like &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; or  &quot;Platoon.&quot; It definitely shows the bleak nature of the Germans'  losing effort in Russia, and that alone makes it a must-see for war-film  buffs.

Austra,"[34, 37]","When STALINGRAD was released in Germany in 1992 it was accompanied by a flood of books, magazines and modeling kits in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad.  As with most German-made World War Two movies, this film focuses on the honorable actions of a small infantry unit rather than the Reich's broader political-stragetic designs.  The film opens with a battalion of hardened infantrymen transfering from the relative comfort of Italy to the savage reality of the Steppes.  From that point the focus narrows to a handful of German soldiers attempting to survive in world gone mad.  Despite the German 6th Army's setback at Stalingrad, the German command continues to believe in its invincibility with resulting detrimental effect on the soldiers.In terms of hardware the film assembled an impressive list of museum pieces including T-34 tanks, Czech-built Hanomag halftracks and a Junkers Ju-52 aircraft for the production.  Indeed, the Ju-52 retained its winter camouflage after the filming and made the rounds at air shows.STALINGRAD does not have much in the way of an impressive soundtrack.  Additionally the film drifts from its subject matter to a melancholy ending in the snow.  STALINGRAD did not do very well in its limited US big screen release.  The widescreen DVD is an improvement over the VHS tape.  As other reviewers have recommended, it is best to see the film in German with English subtitles, though the subtitles leave out quite a bit of the dialogue.Overall this film ranks highly with other war films.

412254,A28PRU8FTMCT8J,6304287305,"Leonard Fleisig ""Len""","[122, 126]","That was the question Job once asked himself in the Bible.  If Job had been alive and on the eastern front in World War II he may have found the answer to his question - Stalingrad. The hellish battle of Stalingrad, as seen through the eyes of a small band of German soldiers, is the subject of director Joseph Vilsmaier's visually stunning and brutal film Stalingrad.Stalingrad begins on the Italian coast where a German platoon enjoys leave after the Battle of El Alamein in North Africa.  Recovering from wounds and enjoying wine and German women while sitting along a bright, sunny, beach the men are called to order. A new opportunity for glory awaits them in Russia.  Next stop Stalingrad.  We see the platoon boarding a train and entering a tunnel in Italy and exiting a tunnel into Russia.  We see the platoon's new officer Lt. Witzland writing home to his wife.  A stranger to battle, Witzland writes of the glories to come and of his hopes that he will prove himself to the battle-hardened men under his command.  As we shall see, Witzland does indeed prove himself but not in the manner he could ever have predicted.Witzland's baptism starts immediately upon disembarkation on the outskirts of Stalingrad. Horrified at the mistreatment of some Red Army prisoners he protests only to find himself knocked into the mud and sneered at by the powers that be.  Word quickly spreads that this callow youth is a ""friend of the Russians"" and only his father's military background saves him.The platoon is ordered to take a factory and the horror begins. Amidst flame throwers, horrible deaths and raw sewage all thoughts of romantic heroism evaporate and Witzland soon learns that survival is the one and only rational, if hopeless, goal one should take into war.  Witzland's ultimate humanity never deserts him and, contrary to orders, tries to arrange a brief truce so that the Russians and Germans can gather their wounded.  The truce is horribly boggled and the platoon's descent into hell continues in lock step with Stalingrad's descent into a frozen Russian winter. The platoon is arrested for trying to jump the line to get one of their men some medication and they find themselves doing duty as human mine sweepers.The German army is soon encircled by a Red Army break out and despite the devastation they know is forthcoming the fanatics among them commit even greater horrors. As the men wait for a break through that never comes the excesses of the fanatics continues.  The appearance of the men devolves along with the situation.  The end, the apocalypse that awaits the trapped Germany army is inevitable; only 6,000 men out of more than 250,000 survived the battle or their imprisonment in the USSR. Witzland's final attempt to reclaim his humanity is a stunning one.The above outline does not do justice to the power of Stalingrad.  Although seen through a German lens that captures no small amount of the humanity of the common German foot soldier, it does not flinch from showing the horrors unleashed in the name of the German people, the Volk, and overseen by a series of true-believers for whom no act of violence is too sadistic or too meaningless.  Portraying the differences between the typical German foot soldier and the S.S. for example is not new.  However, Vilsmaier handles the distinction in an effective and (seemingly) realistic way that neither excuses the behavior nor tries to limit attribution of horrific acts to a small group of less than human soldiers.  Brutality is omnipresent but that brutality renders the flashes of humanity evidenced by the platoon all the more stunning.Stalingrad is a haunting film and one that will linger long after the final credits run.",4,Deeper than hell; what canst thou know?  _,1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,3709,"['was', 'question', 'Job', 'once', 'asked', 'Bible', 'Job', 'had', 'been', 'alive', 'eastern', 'front', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'answer', 'question', 'Stalingrad', 'hellish', 'battle', 'Stalingrad', 'seen', 'eyes', 'small', 'band', 'German', 'soldiers', 'subject', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Vilsmaier', 'visually', 'stunning', 'brutal', 'film', 'Stalingrad.Stalingrad', 'Italian', 'coast', 'where', 'German', 'platoon', 'enjoys', 'leave', 'Battle', 'El', 'Alamein', 'North', 'Africa', 'Recovering', 'wounds', 'enjoying', 'wine', 'German', 'women', 'sitting', 'bright', 'sunny', 'beach', 'men', 'are', 'called', 'order', 'new', 'opportunity', 'glory', 'awaits', 'Russia', 'Next', 'stop', 'Stalingrad', 'see', 'platoon', 'boarding', 'train', 'entering', 'tunnel', 'Italy', 'exiting', 'tunnel', 'Russia', 'see', 'platoon', 'new', 'officer', 'Lt.', 'Witzland', 'writing', 'home', 'wife', 'stranger', 'battle', 'Witzland', 'glories', 'come', 'hopes', 'will', 'prove', 'battle-hardened', 'men', 'command', 'shall', 'see', 'Witzland', 'indeed', 'prove', 'not', 'manner', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'predicted.Witzland', 'baptism', 'immediately', 'upon', 'disembarkation', 'outskirts', 'Stalingrad', 'Horrified', 'mistreatment', 'Red', 'Army', 'prisoners', 'only', 'find', 'knocked', 'mud', 'sneered', 'powers', 'be', 'Word', 'quickly', 'callow', 'youth', 'friend', 'Russians', 'only', 'father', 'military', 'background', 'him.The', 'platoon', 'ordered', 'take', 'factory', 'horror', 'Amidst', 'flame', 'throwers', 'horrible', 'deaths', 'raw', 'sewage', 'thoughts', 'romantic', 'heroism', 'evaporate', 'Witzland', 'soon', 'survival', 'one', 'only', 'rational', 'hopeless', 'goal', 'one', 'should', 'take', 'war', 'Witzland', 'ultimate', 'humanity', 'never', 'contrary', 'orders', 'tries', 'arrange', 'brief', 'truce', 'Russians', 'Germans', 'can', 'gather', 'wounded', 'truce', 'horribly', 'boggled', 'platoon', 'descent', 'hell', 'lock', 'step', 'Stalingrad', 'descent', 'frozen', 'Russian', 'winter', 'platoon', 'arrested', 'trying', 'jump', 'line', 'get', 'one', 'men', 'medication', 'find', 'doing', 'duty', 'human', 'mine', 'sweepers.The', 'German', 'army', 'soon', 'encircled', 'Red', 'Army', 'break', 'devastation', 'know', 'forthcoming', 'fanatics', 'commit', 'even', 'greater', 'horrors', 'men', 'wait', 'break', 'never', 'excesses', 'fanatics', 'appearance', 'men', 'situation', 'end', 'apocalypse', 'trapped', 'Germany', 'army', 'inevitable', 'only', '6,000', 'men', 'more', '250,000', 'survived', 'battle', 'imprisonment', 'USSR', 'Witzland', 'final', 'attempt', 'reclaim', 'humanity', 'stunning', 'one.The', 'outline', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'power', 'Stalingrad', 'seen', 'German', 'small', 'amount', 'humanity', 'common', 'German', 'foot', 'soldier', 'not', 'flinch', 'showing', 'horrors', 'unleashed', 'name', 'German', 'people', 'Volk', 'overseen', 'series', 'true-believers', 'whom', 'act', 'violence', 'too', 'sadistic', 'too', 'meaningless', 'Portraying', 'differences', 'typical', 'German', 'foot', 'soldier', 'S.S.', 'example', 'not', 'new', 'However', 'Vilsmaier', 'distinction', 'effective', 'seemingly', 'realistic', 'way', 'behavior', 'tries', 'limit', 'attribution', 'horrific', 'acts', 'small', 'group', 'less', 'human', 'soldiers', 'Brutality', 'omnipresent', 'brutality', 'flashes', 'humanity', 'evidenced', 'platoon', 'more', 'stunning.Stalingrad', 'haunting', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'linger', 'long', 'final', 'credits', 'run']",Stalingrad VHS

412260,A2E9TRM8096BXU,6304287305,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[29, 47]","""Stalingrad"" is the most depressing film I've ever seen. Mind you, I didn't think a story about the death of 260,000 German soldiers would be as uplifting as, say, ""The Sound of Music"" but this movie pulls out all the stops in an effort to leave the viewer a quivering, glassy-eyed emotional pulp.Made by the same producers who gave us the seminal ""Das Boot"" I found it not in that league. The film is overlong, sterotypical, and spends too much time cramming postwar German conscience pangs down the viewer's throat. Moreover, the last hour or so reminds me of those interminable scenes from ""Born on the Fourth of July"" that seem more interested in punishing the audience than advancing the story. The battle for, and siege of, Stalingrad, was no doubt an experience of horror and misery beyond the power of words or images to describe it, but what I was hoping for here was a German version of ""Saving Private Ryan"" -- high on combat and confusion, short on moralizing. Unfortunately, all postwar German cinema is filtered through the same revisionist political opinions; this explains why all German war movies inevitably leave you with the feeling like you've been punched in the stomach or clubbed over the head. After about an hour I was hoisting my own flag of surrender; but the pummeling continued.The scene at the airfield, for example, when the wounded men are trying desperately to get out on the last transports, is very hard to watch. From what I've read, however, it seems that discipline in the Stalingrad pocket was maintained until the bitter end, and the airfield scene may more resemble how the producers of the film wanted history to unfold rather than the actual way it did. In fact, the 90,000 men who lived to surrender (all but 5,000 of whom died in captivity) did so only when they were completely out of fuel, medicine, and ammunition, and had no other means to resist; but the producers, of course, permit to trace of pride in military accomplishment to enter into their film.Most American movies and television portray the Germans in World War II as heel-clicking cartoon idiots (""I know nutink!

412261,A16XRPF40679KG,6304287305,Michael Dobey,"[1, 3]","I liked this movie , although it like most modern war movies doesn't really reflect the attitudes of most people of the time. the dvd looks pretty good though, it's a german movie dubbed into english.  but this doesn't reflect what the real situation was mainly,  The soldiers fighting in stalingrad mostly believed in what they were doing , both sides fought to the death with neither army accepting any dissention. In fact even after they'd lost the axis soldiers mostly were sure they were right. It wasn't until many years later that they'd realized that they were fighting for a nightmarish regime and that they were often robotic in their worship of that regime.  Hopefully people who watch this will watch real documentaries about the battle. The latest on secrets of the dead tv show proved that stalin told his men to hold and not to retreat in this area which cost the soviets many lives. The legend was that he retreated and lead Hitler into a trap which just isn't true.  But this flick does show the brutality of war and hopelessness of the men trapped in stalingrad where only 5,000 men out of the whole 6th army would ever return home.  So I would say it's a good war movie done without cgi.  This movie follows a small group of men in the battle of course it can't do the real battles horrors justice. Not even the higher budget 'enemy at the gates' could do that!  But fans of war movies should enjoy this one and they shouldn't mind the subtitles either. It's pretty fast moving and well made for it's budget.

412265,A33TBHM3O9AY17,6304287305,No one of consequence,"[20, 21]","I'm an amateur WW2 historian, so this movie was a must see for me.  I have always been fascinated by the battle of Stalingrad, and have always been disappointed by the dearth of movies on the subject.  This offering not only gives a truly graphic view of the battle, but carries with it a somber message.  No happy ending here.The story centers on a company of German assault engineers who have been fighting in North Africa.  After a furlough on the Mediterranean coast, they are redeployed to fight Russians on the eastern front, and find themselves thrust into the battle of Stalingrad.  Even as seasoned veterans, they are unprepared for the horror that awaits them.The protagonist is an idealistic young lieutenant seeking to earn the respect of his men.  His introduction to the realities of Stalingrad is abrupt and harsh, and only goes downhill after the initial encounter.The first half of the movie focuses on the factory fighting which so exemplified the larger battle.  The scenes are gruesome and unspeakably violent, and so provide a glimpse into the brutality that was Stalingrad.  The latter half of the movie deals with events following the Russian encirclement of November, 1942, and is truly a study in abject human misery.I will not give away the ending for those who haven't seen it.  I will say, though, that the emotional toll of this movie is akin to ""Schindler's List.""

412266,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,6304287305,Octavius,"[15, 15]","This moving German film on the decisive battle of Stalingrad is a stunning portryal of the abysmal defeat Germany's 6th Army suffered at the hands of Soviet forces in 1943. A battle that cost almost 2 million lives and acted as the turning point in WWII.  Released before 'Saving Private Ryan', this film has some of the most visually moving and horrid war scenes I have ever seen.The film's scenes and plot do an excellent job at portraying how the German army progressed from gleaming confidence to utter dissillusionment and despair in their campaign on the Eastern Front. Overjoyed at the German army's major victories in the Eastern Front, Hitler is convinced the he now has sufficient forces to crush the Red Army and take the oil fields to the South needed to fuel the German war machine while simultaneously cutting off Russia's main fuel supply. Maniacally deluded that victory is certain, Hitler commits the 6th and 4th Armies towards seizing the city.  Under high attrition, the Germans drive the Soviets across the Volga but the arrival of Winter literally freezes any further offensive.  Leaving Winter to faithfully fight the Great Patriotic War for Mother Russia as it did with Napoleon and his Grande Armee in 1812, the Soviets add to the suffering by launching an unexpected counter offensive in which a break is made against the Romanian army leading to a complete envelopment of the city and the 6th Army with the destruction of the 4th Panzer Army.  Trapped, General Paulus is absurdedly promoted by Hitler to the rank of field marshall in hope that he would not break the record of no German field marshall having ever surrendered.  Paulus and the 6th are then ordered to fight to the death and not to yield one meter to the Soviets. Abandoned by Hitler and any hope of relief, the 6th Army deteriorates into a motley of starving and frostbitten soldiers defending themselves mostly with booby traps and snipers while scavaging for scraps. Discarded as traitors by Hitler and told to fight to the end, the 6th Army that had started with over 190,000 men was reduced to only 90,000 soldiers who surrendered in January 1943: only 6000 of them returned alive from brutal Soviet captivity to tell their tale after the war. The film focuses on the lives and characters of a platoon and their experiences. Full of hope, pride, and arrogance as they leave Italy in the beginning, the audience sees the characters deteriorate into little more than frightened animals seeking safety from the wrath of the enemy and the unforgiving winter conditions. The movie has some distortions as to the common perceptions held by German soldiers as to their role in the Third Reich's army but this is to emphasize the issue of conscience, to present the characters as sympathetic, and to create plot tension. As is typical with many WWII movies, there is the stereotypical amoral Nazi hardline party member to act as a counterpoint. These narrative/cinematic techniques are not too obtrusive in this film though and don't erode the impact of the movie. This movie is far better than 'Enemy At The Gates' which covers the same battle. It's not innundated with cliche dialogue and stereotypical Hollywood portrayals of Soviets or Germans. The closing scene has to be the grimmest ending I have seen in any war film.The film remains a sober drama and brings the full impact as to the horrible conditions German and Soviet soldiers fought under in that fateful battle that would be the turning point of WWII giving the initiative to the Allies for counter-offensive maneuvers. As with Napoleon's defeat to Tsar Alexander I, the German defeat at Stalingrad stands as one of the greatest catastrophic defeats suffered in military history.  In terms of the cost of lives and human suffering, it is probably the worst of any in history along with the fall of Leningrad.  So intensive was this battle that certain parts of the city never saw snow due to the massive artillery barrage launched by the soviets in the confined sector of the surrounded 6th Army.  So horrid was the winter that even oil would freeze rendering firearms, artillery, and motor parts useless after prolonged exposure.  So desperate were all involved that many were forced to cannibalism for survival.  This movie portrays these morbid and pitiful conditions in perfect detail.  This is definitely not a movie for children or the faint of heart but I strongly recommend this moving and realistic drama for those reasons.",4,Total Anihilation,1090886400,"07 27, 2004",2004,4485,"['moving', 'German', 'film', 'decisive', 'battle', 'Stalingrad', 'stunning', 'portryal', 'abysmal', 'defeat', 'Germany', '6th', 'Army', 'suffered', 'hands', 'Soviet', 'forces', '1943', 'battle', 'almost', '2', 'million', 'lives', 'acted', 'turning', 'point', 'WWII', 'Released', ""'Saving"", 'Private', 'Ryan', 'film', 'most', 'visually', 'moving', 'horrid', 'war', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'film', 'scenes', 'plot', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'how', 'German', 'army', 'progressed', 'gleaming', 'confidence', 'utter', 'dissillusionment', 'despair', 'campaign', 'Eastern', 'Front', 'Overjoyed', 'German', 'army', 'major', 'victories', 'Eastern', 'Front', 'Hitler', 'convinced', 'now', 'sufficient', 'forces', 'crush', 'Red', 'Army', 'take', 'oil', 'fields', 'South', 'needed', 'fuel', 'German', 'war', 'machine', 'simultaneously', 'cutting', 'off', 'Russia', 'main', 'fuel', 'supply', 'Maniacally', 'deluded', 'victory', 'certain', 'Hitler', '6th', '4th', 'Armies', 'seizing', 'city', 'high', 'attrition', 'Germans', 'drive', 'Soviets', 'Volga', 'arrival', 'Winter', 'literally', 'further', 'offensive', 'Leaving', 'Winter', 'faithfully', 'fight', 'Great', 'Patriotic', 'War', 'Mother', 'Russia', 'did', 'Napoleon', 'Grande', 'Armee', '1812', 'Soviets', 'add', 'suffering', 'launching', 'unexpected', 'counter', 'offensive', 'break', 'made', 'Romanian', 'army', 'leading', 'complete', 'envelopment', 'city', '6th', 'Army', 'destruction', '4th', 'Panzer', 'Army', 'Trapped', 'General', 'Paulus', 'absurdedly', 'promoted', 'Hitler', 'rank', 'field', 'marshall', 'hope', 'would', 'not', 'break', 'record', 'German', 'field', 'marshall', 'having', 'ever', 'surrendered', '6th', 'are', 'then', 'ordered', 'fight', 'death', 'not', 'yield', 'one', 'meter', 'Soviets', 'Abandoned', 'Hitler', 'hope', 'relief', '6th', 'Army', 'deteriorates', 'motley', 'starving', 'frostbitten', 'soldiers', 'defending', 'mostly', 'booby', 'traps', 'snipers', 'scavaging', 'scraps', 'Discarded', 'traitors', 'Hitler', 'told', 'fight', 'end', '6th', 'Army', 'had', 'started', '190,000', 'men', 'was', 'reduced', 'only', '90,000', 'soldiers', 'who', 'surrendered', 'January', '1943', 'only', '6000', 'returned', 'alive', 'brutal', 'Soviet', 'captivity', 'tell', 'tale', 'war', 'film', 'lives', 'characters', 'platoon', 'experiences', 'Full', 'hope', 'pride', 'arrogance', 'leave', 'Italy', 'beginning', 'audience', 'characters', 'deteriorate', 'little', 'more', 'frightened', 'animals', 'seeking', 'safety', 'wrath', 'enemy', 'unforgiving', 'winter', 'conditions', 'movie', 'distortions', 'common', 'perceptions', 'held', 'German', 'soldiers', 'role', 'Third', 'Reich', 'army', 'emphasize', 'issue', 'conscience', 'present', 'characters', 'sympathetic', 'create', 'plot', 'tension', 'typical', 'many', 'WWII', 'movies', 'stereotypical', 'amoral', 'Nazi', 'hardline', 'party', 'member', 'act', 'counterpoint', 'narrative/cinematic', 'techniques', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'obtrusive', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'erode', 'impact', 'movie', 'movie', 'far', 'better', ""'Enemy"", 'Gates', 'same', 'battle', 'not', 'innundated', 'cliche', 'dialogue', 'stereotypical', 'Hollywood', 'portrayals', 'Soviets', 'Germans', 'closing', 'scene', 'be', 'grimmest', 'ending', 'have', 'seen', 'war', 'film.The', 'film', 'sober', 'drama', 'full', 'impact', 'horrible', 'conditions', 'German', 'Soviet', 'soldiers', 'fought', 'fateful', 'battle', 'would', 'be', 'turning', 'point', 'WWII', 'giving', 'initiative', 'Allies', 'counter-offensive', 'maneuvers', 'Napoleon', 'defeat', 'Tsar', 'Alexander', 'German', 'defeat', 'Stalingrad', 'one', 'greatest', 'catastrophic', 'defeats', 'suffered', 'military', 'history', 'terms', 'cost', 'lives', 'human', 'suffering', 'probably', 'worst', 'history', 'fall', 'Leningrad', 'So', 'intensive', 'was', 'battle', 'certain', 'parts', 'city', 'never', 'saw', 'snow', 'due', 'massive', 'artillery', 'barrage', 'launched', 'soviets', 'confined', 'sector', 'surrounded', '6th', 'Army', 'So', 'horrid', 'was', 'winter', 'even', 'oil', 'would', 'freeze', 'rendering', 'firearms', 'artillery', 'motor', 'parts', 'useless', 'prolonged', 'exposure', 'So', 'desperate', 'were', 'involved', 'many', 'were', 'forced', 'cannibalism', 'survival', 'movie', 'morbid', 'pitiful', 'conditions', 'perfect', 'detail', 'definitely', 'not', 'movie', 'children', 'faint', 'heart', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'moving', 'realistic', 'drama', 'reasons']",Stalingrad VHS

Obviously with so many german soldiers in this battle you would find some of these kinds of people but all together in one company? That's hard to believe.

It shows what  the other side went thru in the last days of this tragic campaign in the  Eastern Front, of which only 10,000 came back out of the 300,000 who were  sent.

Veteran Wehrmacht Stormtroopers couldn't be that stupid! Ah, but of course the filmakers want to teach us a lesson...And later in the film, the attacking platoon of Soviet tanks and infantry should have completely routed the German ""homeboy"" platoon hastily dug in the frozen Russian steppe (with only one 37mm anti-tank gun!).Instead the ill-equiped Germans destroy every single T-34 tank and enemy soldier. Oh, it probally isn't time for all the German characters in the movie to die miserably just yet...And thereafter until the movie's end, not another ""Ivan"" platoon or even soldier is shown.

Director Joseph Vilsmaier does a good job of bringing the viewer into the hell that these men had to endure.The film focuses on three main characters: Sgt.

Though Rollo and Reiser are experienced combat veterans, both are stunned by the sight of the wounded and dying soldiers on the train platform just outside of Stalingrad. For Rollo and Reiser, this is a harbinger of things to come.Lieutenant von Witzland is a young, inexperienced officer who feels he must prove himself to win the respect of his men. However, his ideals and aspirations are soon shattered by the brutality and horror of combat. Eventually, von Witzalnd realizes that this is a lost cause and he openly declares that he no longer feels bound by his oath as an officer.Even though this movie is a bit slow at times and has an obvious political message, there's still a lot of action that will keep you interested.

Ryan"", it is more pyschologically disturbing.  This is not an uplifting movie, but then again something set in Stalingrad is not suppose to be!  The equipment and uniforms are all accurate, as befitting the producers of Das Boot.  The storyline is pretty basic, a series of horrondus sequences as we watch the slow death of the German 6th army.  I found keeping track of the various German actors a little difficult as they all looked pretty much the same after a while, especially after the wear and tear of battle.  The end scene in the Bunker with the captured Russian female who speaks German was a bit contrieved, but it does add extra irony and poigancy to an already harsh film.No doubt the older Italian movie ""Attack and Retreat"" served as a partial inspiration.  The more recent ""Enemy at the Gates"" provides more of a storyline and romance than this movie, and makes for an interesting contrast.For sheer rawness and power Stalingrad has a lot going for it, and while not as graphic as ""Ryan"", it does not pretend to have any uplifting message.

412284,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,6304287305,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[7, 19]",The battle of Stalingrad is usually seen as the decisive battle of World War II which led to the defeat of the conservative alliance which was led by Nazi Germany. What happened was that after the defeat of the Soviet Offensive around Kharkov German forces advanced deep into Soviet Territory towards the important rail junction of Stalingrad. The aim of the German offensive was to cut off the industrial sections of the Soviet Union from its sources of petroleum in the Caucus.The problem was that the German forces were poorly supplied and poorly supported by inadequately equipped Romanian armies.  The Soviets were able to initially holt the German advance at Stalingrand and to then destroy the supporting armies trapping the German Sixth Army in a pocket. The Germans had no strategic reserve and had to withdraw their forces in the south leaving the sixth army to be captured. The German Sixth Army held on for some time in appalling conditions. Huge numbers of soldiers succumbed to starvation and to the cold.This film is about the battle of Stalingrad. It tells the story from the point of view of a small number of soldiers trapped in the pocket.The difficulty of making a film about the battle from the German point of view is what do you say. In years gone by the approach of Germans to their history was to suggest that the evils of the Nazi regime were limited to the SS and to organs of the ruling party. The army by comparison had performed in a brilliant way and maintained its honour. It is clear now days that in fact the German Army was involved in a range of brutal crimes against the general Russian population.This film tries to sidestep the historical issues by concentrating on a group of soldiers at a low level. They are mildly rebellious and one of them loses a combat decoration for insubordination. The main characters are shown to have served with the Africa Korps and are transferred in the beginning of the film to the Russian front. The film charts the early optimism of the Stalingrad campaign and shows how after the Soviet winter offensive the position of the Germans grew more and more desperate.The technique of the film maker is to suggest that the characters are basically decent. This is shown by their kindness towards Russian captives and civilians. The exist in a world in which the villains are the officer Corp and the leaders.  The film is a tragedy in which the common soldiers try firstly to survive and then to escape. In the end they fail and become some of the countless casualties of battle.The film is reasonably easy to watch but it fails really to deal with the subject in a reasonable way. It is not an action adventure film and it is not a very realistic film either.,2,So So,1014768000,"02 27, 2002",2002,2728,"['battle', 'Stalingrad', 'usually', 'seen', 'decisive', 'battle', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'led', 'defeat', 'conservative', 'alliance', 'was', 'led', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'What', 'happened', 'was', 'defeat', 'Soviet', 'Offensive', 'Kharkov', 'German', 'forces', 'advanced', 'deep', 'Soviet', 'Territory', 'important', 'rail', 'junction', 'Stalingrad', 'aim', 'German', 'offensive', 'was', 'cut', 'off', 'industrial', 'sections', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'sources', 'petroleum', 'Caucus.The', 'problem', 'was', 'German', 'forces', 'were', 'poorly', 'supplied', 'poorly', 'supported', 'inadequately', 'equipped', 'Romanian', 'armies', 'Soviets', 'were', 'able', 'initially', 'holt', 'German', 'advance', 'Stalingrand', 'then', 'destroy', 'supporting', 'armies', 'trapping', 'German', 'Sixth', 'Army', 'pocket', 'Germans', 'had', 'strategic', 'reserve', 'had', 'withdraw', 'forces', 'south', 'leaving', 'sixth', 'army', 'be', 'captured', 'German', 'Sixth', 'Army', 'held', 'time', 'appalling', 'conditions', 'Huge', 'numbers', 'soldiers', 'succumbed', 'starvation', 'cold.This', 'film', 'battle', 'Stalingrad', 'story', 'point', 'view', 'small', 'number', 'soldiers', 'trapped', 'pocket.The', 'difficulty', 'making', 'film', 'battle', 'German', 'point', 'view', 'what', 'do', 'say', 'years', 'gone', 'approach', 'Germans', 'history', 'was', 'suggest', 'evils', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'were', 'limited', 'SS', 'organs', 'ruling', 'party', 'army', 'comparison', 'had', 'performed', 'brilliant', 'way', 'maintained', 'honour', 'clear', 'now', 'days', 'fact', 'German', 'Army', 'was', 'involved', 'range', 'brutal', 'crimes', 'general', 'Russian', 'population.This', 'film', 'tries', 'sidestep', 'historical', 'issues', 'concentrating', 'group', 'soldiers', 'low', 'level', 'are', 'mildly', 'rebellious', 'one', 'combat', 'decoration', 'insubordination', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'shown', 'have', 'served', 'Africa', 'Korps', 'are', 'transferred', 'beginning', 'film', 'Russian', 'front', 'film', 'early', 'optimism', 'Stalingrad', 'campaign', 'how', 'Soviet', 'winter', 'offensive', 'position', 'Germans', 'grew', 'more', 'more', 'desperate.The', 'technique', 'film', 'maker', 'suggest', 'characters', 'are', 'basically', 'decent', 'shown', 'kindness', 'Russian', 'captives', 'civilians', 'exist', 'world', 'villains', 'are', 'officer', 'Corp', 'leaders', 'film', 'tragedy', 'common', 'soldiers', 'try', 'firstly', 'survive', 'then', 'escape', 'end', 'fail', 'become', 'countless', 'casualties', 'battle.The', 'film', 'reasonably', 'easy', 'watch', 'really', 'deal', 'subject', 'reasonable', 'way', 'not', 'action', 'adventure', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'realistic', 'film']",Stalingrad VHS

( although Stalingrad was released long before Saving Private Ryan) Both films take us down to a platoon level to  show the grim horror and reality of war on a day by day, hour by hour, blow  by blow basis. Stalingrad was one of the most bloodiest and ferocious  battles of World War 2, which blunted Hitlers thrust into Russia and then  was ultimately a turning point. The film Stalingrad promises alot ( it is  from the makers of &quot;Das Boot&quot;) but I felt I gained no real  affinity with the characters portrayed and therefore the film petered out  and the last half hour dragged on.  However, even with these deficiencies  this is still a good, strong film and has some 1st class battles scenes (  especially the Russian tank attack).

Also, it attempts to bring to the popular audience something from history, which is to be commended, uh, of course.The film is nevertheless remarkable for its unwillingness to explore the complexity of the history of Stalingrad; and its ability to render banal and even annoying the obvious truth that war is nasty. I found the film to be one cliche after another and much of the dialog was embarassing.The director seems to believe you can avoid creating an exciting narrative, by substituting ""grown men confessing the horror of war."" In the end, the film struck me as self indulgent, not so much honoring history and its victims as using history to massage the pieties of a modern pacifist audience.Stick with the books on the subject.",3,--stick w/ the books on the subject,1117670400,"06 2, 2005",2005,887,"['gave', 'three', 'stars', 'decent', 'job', 'w/', 'visual', 'spectacles', 'suppose', 'prevents', 'getting', 'more', 'deserved', 'two', 'stars', 'Also', 'bring', 'popular', 'audience', 'something', 'history', 'be', 'commended', 'uh', 'course.The', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'remarkable', 'unwillingness', 'explore', 'complexity', 'history', 'Stalingrad', 'ability', 'render', 'banal', 'even', 'annoying', 'obvious', 'truth', 'war', 'nasty', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'cliche', 'much', 'dialog', 'was', 'embarassing.The', 'director', 'believe', 'can', 'avoid', 'creating', 'exciting', 'narrative', 'substituting', 'grown', 'men', 'confessing', 'horror', 'war', 'end', 'film', 'struck', 'self', 'indulgent', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'honoring', 'history', 'victims', 'using', 'history', 'massage', 'pieties', 'modern', 'pacifist', 'audience.Stick', 'books', 'subject']",Stalingrad VHS
412288,A19JDXB5R33C7R,6304287305,WryGuy2,"[5, 5]","""Stalingrad"", by the German producer of the epic submarine movie ""Das Boot"", tells the fictional story of a platoon of German soldiers from their transfer from Italy into Stalingrad until the final German surrender in early 1943.  Although in my opinion this is not as good of a movie as ""Das Boot"", it has much to recommend it.The acting and photography are top notch, as is the sense of realism.  There are two battle scenes in the movie, an attack on an important factory, and a defense against a mixed Soviet infantry-tank force.  The attack on the factory in particular is very convincing.  I recently read ""Island of Fire"", an outstanding book  by Mr Jason Mark which describes, in great detail, the fighting in and around the Barrikady Gun Factory in Stalingrad.  The factory scenes from the movie could have almost been a reenactment from some of the real-life attacks depicted in the book.  Many scenes from the movie, such as the departure of the last transport plane to leave Stalingrad, are very moving and give you a sense of the desperation felt by the starving German forces as the Soviet noose inexorably tightened.However, I found some things in the movie that didn't ring true.  For example, near the beginning of the movie, one of the German soldiers was insubordinate during an award ceremony and to his commanding officer a short time later while on a train, and was not punished, apart from having his decoration revoked.  Having read many books about the Wehrmacht, this soldier would not have acted this way, and if he had, he would have been punished severely.  Another example is that there are several direct and indirect anti-war and anti-Hitler references in the movie.  No matter how the individual soldier may have felt, he would not dared to openly shown those types of sentiments in public.Since this movie is about Stalingrad, you know it's probably not going to end well for the German protagonists, so it's a fairly dark, somewhat depressing film.  It's gritty and you get a sense of getting to know some of the characters.  But this film didn't grab me the same way ""Das Boot"" did.  It's well made, though, and tells a story that not many Americans are familiar with.
