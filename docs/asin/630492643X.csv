It is a blend of many genres, but in the end really can only be solidly categorized as a period piece that focuses on two good natured characters that have little in common except for their love of gambling. Sometimes their shared addiction is used to help each other, othertimes it unintentionally leads to problems, but always down unique and unexpected paths that ultimately take them around the world. In what other movie can you see a church made of glass spectacularly sailing on an Australian river?I am guessing the film was a box office disappointment, because it would be difficult to market. But if you are tired of formulaic movies and want to see something that is ""different"", but not a rambling, incoherent artsy mess, then this is definitely worth taking a chance on. For the price on Amazon you also have little to lose.",5,"Hard to categorize gambling movie, but its uniqueness works",1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,954,"['only', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'go', 'mood', 'certain', 'kind', 'movie', 'blend', 'many', 'genres', 'end', 'really', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'solidly', 'categorized', 'period', 'piece', 'two', 'good', 'natured', 'characters', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'love', 'gambling', 'shared', 'addiction', 'used', 'help', 'other', 'unintentionally', 'problems', 'always', 'down', 'unique', 'unexpected', 'paths', 'ultimately', 'take', 'world', 'what', 'other', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'church', 'made', 'glass', 'spectacularly', 'sailing', 'Australian', 'river', 'am', 'guessing', 'film', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'disappointment', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'market', 'are', 'tired', 'formulaic', 'movies', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'different', 'not', 'rambling', 'incoherent', 'artsy', 'mess', 'then', 'definitely', 'worth', 'taking', 'chance', 'price', 'Amazon', 'also', 'have', 'little', 'lose']",Oscar and Lucinda
439903,AB8J1LJTCJ8LI,630492643X,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","When I think about my favorite movies, I realize the one thing they have in common is that they work on several levels.  OSCAR AND LUCINDA is, at the very least, one of my favorite movies of the '90s.  On its outer level, it is a very intimate, bittersweet love story.  But, dig just a little deeper and you find in every aspect of the movie (the plot, the cinematography, even the music) an illustration of what life really is.  Brief, painful, with a few, sometimes very brief and unfulfilled joys.  When I watch this movie, I get a very similar feeling as when I read the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible.  &quot;And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind.  Because in much wisdom there is much grief, and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain.&quot;  [Ecc. 1:17,18]  To me, that is the essence of this movie.This same underlying theme is throughout Peter Carey's book, which Laura Jones did an excellent job rewriting for the screenplay.  I suppose some fans of the novel may be upset that the very ending was changed for the movie, and even though it does give a different twist, I think it works both ways.  Another masterful book-to-film undertaken by L. Jones was AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE, definitely recommended if you enjoyed this movie.The R rating for this movie is a shame, since there's really only one scene warranting that rating.  Take that out, and you have, at the very most, a PG movie.  Just get ahold of this movie, sit back and enjoy the scenery, story, acting, and music.  Or, just watch a little closer, and enjoy it on a different level.  Either way, it'll work.",5,Striving after Wind,989107200,"05 6, 2001",2001,1665,"['When', 'think', 'favorite', 'movies', 'realize', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'common', 'work', 'several', 'levels', 'OSCAR', 'LUCINDA', 'very', 'least', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', ""'90s"", 'outer', 'level', 'very', 'intimate', 'bittersweet', 'story', 'dig', 'just', 'little', 'deeper', 'find', 'aspect', 'movie', 'plot', 'cinematography', 'even', 'music', 'illustration', 'what', 'life', 'really', 'Brief', 'painful', 'few', 'sometimes', 'very', 'brief', 'unfulfilled', 'joys', 'When', 'watch', 'movie', 'get', 'very', 'similar', 'feeling', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'Ecclesiastes', 'Bible', 'quot', 'set', 'mind', 'know', 'wisdom', 'know', 'madness', 'folly', 'realized', 'also', 'striving', 'wind', 'much', 'wisdom', 'much', 'grief', 'increasing', 'knowledge', 'results', 'increasing', 'pain.', 'quot', 'Ecc', '1:17,18', ']', 'essence', 'movie.This', 'same', 'underlying', 'theme', 'Peter', 'Carey', 'book', 'Laura', 'Jones', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'rewriting', 'screenplay', 'suppose', 'fans', 'novel', 'may', 'be', 'upset', 'very', 'ending', 'was', 'changed', 'movie', 'even', 'give', 'different', 'twist', 'think', 'ways', 'masterful', 'book-to-film', 'undertaken', 'L.', 'Jones', 'was', 'AN', 'ANGEL', 'AT', 'MY', 'TABLE', 'definitely', 'recommended', 'enjoyed', 'movie.The', 'R', 'rating', 'movie', 'shame', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'warranting', 'rating', 'Take', 'out', 'have', 'very', 'most', 'PG', 'movie', 'Just', 'get', 'ahold', 'movie', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'scenery', 'story', 'acting', 'music', 'just', 'watch', 'little', 'closer', 'enjoy', 'different', 'level', 'way', ""'ll"", 'work']",Oscar and Lucinda

Filmed in the English countryside where the weather is infinitely damp and dreary.  Oscar Hopkins grows up into a tainted Anglican priest who met his fate on a floating church.  The rivers there are so narrow a healthy boy could jump from one bank to another.Grown and in higher education, he became involved in gambling as an off-shoot of his wild influencial friends who enjoyed corrupting him, like Justin.  He became a pathological gambler.  Some of the tale was hard to understand as those Australians talk funnier than the British.  Cate Blanchett, an American, portrayed the grown Lucinda as an innocent manueverer who met Oscar on the boat and confessed to him as a priest, about her fascination to play dice and cards.  He understood her fascination as he too bet on the horses, like Mark.  Her love, another priest, does not believe in the virgin birth, nor do I.  It takes a man not a spirit.  He married someone else.Lucinda's orange cat matched her hair color -- and Oscar's.  Fate and gambling brought them together in an uncouth and wild gambling hall.  Oscar was as mannerly and cautious as Mark.  ""She is my guest, Mrs. Journey.""  He even laughs like Mark.  ""You may leave the way you came.""  She follows after him and unashamedly pursues him with no let=up, even as he prays in church.  ""I gambled for a purpose -- there was no sin.  We have a history.""  She is heartless but playful, good for him as they laugh together.He is fascinated and envisions a church made of glass.  ""I shall be here until the end; I have much to do.""  He is an extraordinary chap.  Back-biting by unscrupulous managers left him with Mark's tossled hair.  The floating church was a glory to behold.  And it ended up as a submerged tomb.",4,Six Rivers to Cross.,1222300800,"09 25, 2008",2008,1811,"['What', 'started', 'religious', 'tale', 'rapidly', 'disintegrated', 'sin', 'commission', 'Filmed', 'English', 'countryside', 'where', 'weather', 'infinitely', 'damp', 'dreary', 'Oscar', 'up', 'tainted', 'Anglican', 'priest', 'who', 'met', 'fate', 'floating', 'church', 'rivers', 'are', 'so', 'narrow', 'healthy', 'boy', 'could', 'jump', 'one', 'bank', 'another.Grown', 'higher', 'education', 'became', 'involved', 'gambling', 'off-shoot', 'wild', 'influencial', 'friends', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'corrupting', 'Justin', 'became', 'pathological', 'gambler', 'tale', 'was', 'hard', 'understand', 'Australians', 'talk', 'funnier', 'British', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'American', 'portrayed', 'grown', 'Lucinda', 'innocent', 'manueverer', 'who', 'met', 'Oscar', 'boat', 'confessed', 'priest', 'fascination', 'play', 'dice', 'cards', 'understood', 'fascination', 'too', 'bet', 'horses', 'Mark', 'love', 'priest', 'not', 'believe', 'virgin', 'birth', 'do', 'man', 'not', 'spirit', 'married', 'someone', 'else.Lucinda', 'orange', 'cat', 'matched', 'hair', 'color', 'Oscar', 'Fate', 'gambling', 'brought', 'together', 'uncouth', 'wild', 'gambling', 'hall', 'Oscar', 'was', 'mannerly', 'cautious', 'Mark', 'guest', 'Mrs', 'Journey', 'even', 'Mark', 'may', 'leave', 'way', 'came', 'unashamedly', 'let=up', 'even', 'church', 'gambled', 'purpose', 'was', 'sin', 'have', 'history', 'heartless', 'playful', 'good', 'laugh', 'together.He', 'fascinated', 'church', 'made', 'glass', 'shall', 'be', 'here', 'end', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'extraordinary', 'chap', 'Back-biting', 'unscrupulous', 'managers', 'left', 'Mark', 'tossled', 'hair', 'floating', 'church', 'was', 'glory', 'behold', 'ended', 'up', 'submerged', 'tomb']",Oscar and Lucinda

But something has happened to render the 'world' of the film oppressively neurotic and irrelevant. Do we live in a post-Christian world? If so, this may account for the desperate strangeness of the men of the cloth, who seem tortured and twisted and sick. They are either socially oppressive, trivial hypocrites, or tormented, lost souls, paralyzed by guilt and doubt or both. They all remind me of Flannery O'Connor's world of distorted freaks. The acting is superb, of course, but the tale is a total letdown, not so much depressing as just anti-climatic. It has none of the magnificence of ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"", which it reminded me of. One problem is the character played to perfection by Ralph Fiennes. It is more than irritating is see a man play a worm. It is in the end painful to watch this man rubbing his hands together and crawling around on the ground. Call it what you will, this is not the kind of character one can relate to.

I would venture to say that her presence can elevate an otherwise mediocre film to being good. This is no easy feat. Oscar and Lucinda is a somewhat slow moving period picture, and while the subject matter is interesting, it will not engage the interest of every viewer. The movie could be well served with analysis of its complex elements, including its main characters' upbringings, the religious background of Ralph Fiennes's character, and the symbolic nature of the glass church the main characters build at the end. Blanchett is remarkable as the unconventional and gambling-addicted Miss Leplastrier, while the always brilliant Ralph Fiennes plays a tormented and equally gambling-addicted love interest who has been estranged from his deeply religious father. The characters are complex and rich, and the interaction between Blanchett and Fiennes' characters are deeply human and believable. The addictions from which both characters suffer are also quite believable onscreen. I felt that this was an underrated picture hindered only by the fact that it moved slowly.

439914,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,630492643X,Green Manalishi,"[3, 3]","Ralph Fiennes was good in this movie.  It is amazing to me that he was able to so transform himself into this character.  In my opinion his performance was better than Blanchett's though she was good also. The story is kind of deep with lots of different angles, the religious angle is both mystical and traditional/conventional.  Story takes place in the late 1800s in Australia, New South Wales - not surprisingly, the scenery is lush and beautiful.  But beyond scenery, there are some real sublime moments in the human drama as well.  Fiennes character is deeply religious and bases his communication with God almost on I Ching style divination tactics.  That is, heads or tails will help him determine what he beleives God wants him to do.To come up with money to meet the basic necessities of living, he takes to betting on horse racing after a friend introduces him to the pastime.  He keeps what he needs and gives the rest to the poor.  His faith seems to keep him winning.  It starts to become a real issue for him though when he realizes he is no longer using the gambling simply as a means to an end, but that in fact he is enjoying the thrill of it as well.  There is a hilarious scene where, somehow by mistake Blanchett's character has come to him for confession and when she confesses that she loves to gamble, Fiennes character comes to the conclusion that gambling cannot really be a sin since to beleive in God already is the greatest gamble - those who beleive weigh the odds and are finally betting that He does exist.  Since this belief itself is the ultimate wager - how could God fault a person for wagers much smaller and of much less importance - dice or cards for example?""Where is the sin? We bet. It is all in Pascal. We bet that there is a God.  We bet our lives on it. We calculate the odds and the return.. Our anxiety about our bet wakes us before dawn in a cold sweat.  And God sees us suffer.  I cannot beleive that such a God, whose fundamental requirement of us is that we gamble our souls - it's true, we stake everything on the fact of His existence -- I cannot beleive that such a God can look unkindly on a chap wagering a few quid on the likelihood of a dumb animal crossing the line first..... unless... unless it might be considered a blasphemy to apply to common pleasure that which is divine.""Oscar is not without his personal demons, mostly in the form of ideals that he is constantly trying to live up to.  The ending of the movie was something of a shock, loaded with symbolic possibilities and plain poetry, in a word (see 'a glass church').I saw an Australian version of this DVD.  The cover shows Oscar holding a 5 of diamonds, not a 5 of hearts.  I think I prefer the 5 of diamonds and the clear-eyed expression of the actors rather than the 'romantic' look of the Stateside version.  The movie is more than a romance - although it is a love story as tragic as any by Shakespeare.

One leaves after watching this film much as one does after a gourmet meal...extremely satisfied with what you have consumed but not wishing to eat another morsel and yet this continues over time so that you do not feel the need to return.I was transfixed throughout by the ""action"" within the film.

The story seems to be without any obvious flaws and the casting is superb with the main players clearly complemetary to each other and the cinematography is superb.One thing that I had not paid too much attention to during my first viewing was the appalling and barbaric treatment of the indigenous population. Clearly the scene of the massacre is a solitary tale of man's inhumanity to man but the subsequent scene of the abuse of the aboriginal woman in the inn is a more subtle but nevertheless graphic reminder of the way in which settlers have behaved throughout the world.

Ralph Fiennes, who was twice nominated for Oscars for ""Schindler's List"" in 1993 & ""The English Patient"" in 1996, does a marvelous job communicating the insecurity and wild love of gambling.  His giddy scene with Lucinda on the ship where his eyes light up and he says, ""Let's play!"" is pure delight.  His blazing red hair is an artistic achievement in and of itself.  Cate Blanchett that the film credits as ""introducing"" is a delight as the independent girl who loses her mother and is thrust into the world.  Blanchett won the Oscar in 2004 for ""The Aviator"" & was nominated for ""Elizabeth"" in 1998.  Her performance is nuanced and charming.  Ciaran Hinds who has been in films ""Miami Vice,"" ""Munich,"" & ""Veronica Guerin"" does a great job as the fluctuating Rev. Dennis Hasset.  Tom Wilkinson who was Oscar-nominated for ""In the Bedroom"" in 2001 does a good job as the Anglican preacher who receives Oscar upon his call to ministry and tries to learn Oscar's system of gambling.  Richard Roxburgh who appeared in ""Moulin Rouge"" & ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" plays Mr. Jeffris who leads the company overland and slaughters the natives.  He does a good job of presenting a variety of character levels in a limited number of scenes.  Josephine Byrnes who was also in ""Matrix Reloaded"" plays the mischievous Miriam Chadwick who eventually becomes mother to Oscar's child.  Gillian Armstrong who directed ""My Brilliant Career"" & ""Little Women"" didn't receive much recognition for this film, although the film did garner one Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design for Janet Patterson.  The acting, cinematography, set design (glass church), costumes and directing of this piece are first rate.

I was looking for that specific point that would 4 star this movie but never found it. I loved the glass church - but the tragic end of Oscar took that beauty away... It could have been so much more but failed in the love story class and the historic as well. The only saving grace was the scenery...even viewing it on my Kindle Fire it showed up magnificent!

His characterization of the frail, nervous, minister's son, is one of the finest performances on film, and the one that made me a lifelong fan.  He never steps out of character, and it is amazing even seeing this a second time, how he perfected the spastic, hand movements, and the general ""twitchiness"" of the character, that implies some kind of neurological defect but never mentions it.  In spite of this, Oscar is a visionary, internally courageous, with dreams and ambitions, who sets out to realize his ambitions, in spite of his physical flaws.  Cate Blanchett is the perfect foil as a gutsy heiress determined to achieve something in life, and the two of them form a complete whole together.  While both are superlative, this is Fiennes' picture, probably his very best performance on film.  He has more ""acting"" to do here, and he wins over his audience early on, surviving his harsh upbringing, to find his way as a minister in a different religion than his father's.  You will be distracted by the magnificent cinematography and the leisurely, sybaritic pace of the film, but if you keep focusing on just what Fiennes is doing and how amazingly well he does it, you will shake your head in disbelief that his characterization is so perfect and so well delineated.  His performance elevates him into that exclusive pantheon of all-time greats where Olivier and Depardieu reside.  Long after you have forgotten about the plot, the abuse and the violence, you will remember that this was his finest work.",5,PERHAPS A MAGNUM OPUS,1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,1622,"['are', 'fan', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'then', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'what', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'characterization', 'frail', 'nervous', 'minister', 'son', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'film', 'one', 'made', 'lifelong', 'fan', 'never', 'character', 'amazing', 'even', 'seeing', 'second', 'time', 'how', 'perfected', 'spastic', 'hand', 'movements', 'general', 'twitchiness', 'character', 'kind', 'neurological', 'defect', 'never', 'mentions', 'spite', 'Oscar', 'visionary', 'internally', 'courageous', 'dreams', 'ambitions', 'who', 'out', 'realize', 'ambitions', 'spite', 'physical', 'flaws', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'perfect', 'foil', 'gutsy', 'heiress', 'determined', 'achieve', 'something', 'life', 'two', 'form', 'complete', 'whole', 'together', 'are', 'superlative', 'Fiennes', 'picture', 'probably', 'very', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'more', 'acting', 'do', 'here', 'audience', 'early', 'surviving', 'harsh', 'upbringing', 'find', 'way', 'minister', 'different', 'religion', 'father', 'will', 'be', 'distracted', 'magnificent', 'cinematography', 'leisurely', 'sybaritic', 'pace', 'film', 'keep', 'focusing', 'just', 'what', 'Fiennes', 'doing', 'how', 'amazingly', 'well', 'will', 'shake', 'head', 'disbelief', 'characterization', 'so', 'perfect', 'so', 'well', 'delineated', 'performance', 'exclusive', 'pantheon', 'all-time', 'greats', 'where', 'Olivier', 'Depardieu', 'reside', 'Long', 'have', 'forgotten', 'plot', 'abuse', 'violence', 'will', 'remember', 'was', 'finest', 'work']",Oscar and Lucinda
