632769,A2GDEPPC8BAZRY,B00005JNOG,"A. Casalino ""V^^^^^V""","[4, 5]","Over the past couple decades, I can probably count on one hand the number of television series I've ever watched with any semblance of habit.  In fact, I'd never even watched a single scene in any one of the 24 episodes of this one during the entirety of its first season on air...  What actually happened was that my mind had been by chance in a highly restless and impetuous state one evening several weeks ago, and whilst searching for a DVD to rent appropriate to my pure old brain's disposition, I happened upon LOST- Disc #1, and it sufficed to pique me, so I promptly took it up.  Oh- and Wow!I must indeed thank the Forces That Be for how wonderful that momentary impulse turned out being!Right off the bat, with the opening scene, one can sense that this is something reaching the extraordinary.  A devastating frame: the catastrophic wreckage of a plane ripped apart and smoking- the hellish nightmare of chaos wracked upon a shore of sublime beauty, where stunned survivors clamor about trying to get a grip- the bright sands, the deeper shades of the jungle slightly inland, and the rocky heights of the cliffs against the backdrop of vast ocean and sky, conjures the feeling that the medium projecting all this can't possibly be merely a TV screen.Needless to say, I was hooked from then on. I'd not only made up my mind to watch the rest of the Season One episodes (4 episodes to each of the first 6 DVD's, and then the 7th for special features), but had also made sure that I would acquire them, as I knew I'd certainly not be the only one of my acquaintance to needs get hooked on something such as this.Each episode focuses on one of the 14 main characters in the form of flashbacks while the storyline moves forward on the island (there were some 48 survivors in all, but only a few- the ""take action"", plaintively elite of the bunch - who are the focus.)  Among them are Jack (Matthew Fox), a doctor; Kate (Evangeline Lilly), a fugitive from the law; Locke (Terry O'Quinn), a salesman at a box company; Charlie (Dom Monaghan), a British has-been rock star; Sayid (Naveen Andrews) an Iraqi soldier; and Michael (Harold Perrineau) an unemployed artist & construction worker who had just recently reclaimed his estranged 10-year-old son, Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) after the boy's mother's death.  Add to the mix, with piquant dashes of blessed good chemistry, a rough-necked Texan con artist, a self-centered young woman and her brother, a young Korean couple, an unmarried Australian woman about to give birth, and a young man who'd won the lottery under weird circumstances, and you have here a show that raises the bar for all of network TV entertainment.What makes this series additionally so appealing is its atmosphere, which contains somewhat of an undeniable supernatural factor.  Indeed, it's almost as if the island itself were alive: an entity possessed of a soul all its own.Throughout these many weeks gone by, I've been working my 12-hour night shifts quite a lot, and so ultimately could not help but relay to my co-workers the many extraordinary virtues of this series...  Of course then, naturally and without much persuasion, I began at their behest to bring my LOST DVD set to work, to play as chance would have it, each of us, endeavoring to watch an episode or two during our down-time and breaks.  My colleagues became as hooked as I was, actually, and I derived much pleasure in this re-perusing of it -- found myself laughing heartily in places I would never have singled out as so amusing when watching it alone.  I've found so many inklings in the re-viewing - even some outright portents upon the whole, as to make owning this set very worthwhile.  Truly, there's such great ingenious story weaving, some of which I never would have divined had I not gone over it again.  Oh yes- one can very well be assured of coming to crave the intrigue of the tales these episodes tell - and well into the present season, to be enchanted still by the many separate fates of these wonderfully captivating, vastly intriguing LOST beings and their isle....",5,-Highly Addictive-,1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,4086,"['past', 'couple', 'decades', 'can', 'probably', 'count', 'one', 'hand', 'number', 'television', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'semblance', 'habit', 'fact', ""'d"", 'never', 'even', 'watched', 'single', 'scene', 'one', '24', 'episodes', 'one', 'entirety', 'first', 'season', 'air', 'What', 'actually', 'happened', 'was', 'mind', 'had', 'been', 'chance', 'highly', 'restless', 'impetuous', 'state', 'one', 'evening', 'several', 'weeks', 'ago', 'searching', 'DVD', 'rent', 'appropriate', 'pure', 'old', 'brain', 'disposition', 'happened', 'LOST-', 'Disc', '1', 'sufficed', 'pique', 'so', 'promptly', 'took', 'up', 'Oh-', 'Wow', 'must', 'indeed', 'thank', 'Forces', 'Be', 'how', 'wonderful', 'momentary', 'impulse', 'turned', 'out', 'being', 'Right', 'bat', 'opening', 'scene', 'one', 'can', 'sense', 'something', 'reaching', 'extraordinary', 'devastating', 'frame', 'catastrophic', 'wreckage', 'plane', 'ripped', 'apart', 'smoking-', 'hellish', 'nightmare', 'chaos', 'wracked', 'shore', 'sublime', 'beauty', 'where', 'stunned', 'survivors', 'clamor', 'trying', 'get', 'grip-', 'bright', 'sands', 'deeper', 'shades', 'jungle', 'slightly', 'inland', 'rocky', 'heights', 'cliffs', 'backdrop', 'vast', 'ocean', 'sky', 'feeling', 'medium', 'projecting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'merely', 'TV', 'screen.Needless', 'say', 'was', 'hooked', 'then', ""'d"", 'not', 'only', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'watch', 'rest', 'Season', 'One', '4', 'episodes', 'first', '6', 'DVD', 'then', '7th', 'special', 'features', 'had', 'also', 'made', 'sure', 'would', 'acquire', 'knew', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'not', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'acquaintance', 'needs', 'get', 'hooked', 'something', 'such', 'this.Each', 'episode', 'one', '14', 'main', 'characters', 'form', 'flashbacks', 'storyline', 'forward', 'island', 'were', '48', 'survivors', 'only', 'few-', 'take', 'action', 'plaintively', 'elite', 'bunch', 'who', 'are', 'focus', 'are', 'Jack', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'doctor', 'Kate', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'fugitive', 'law', 'Locke', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'salesman', 'box', 'company', 'Charlie', 'Dom', 'Monaghan', 'British', 'has-been', 'rock', 'star', 'Sayid', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'Iraqi', 'soldier', 'Michael', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'unemployed', 'artist', 'construction', 'worker', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'recently', 'reclaimed', 'estranged', '10-year-old', 'son', 'Walt', 'Malcolm', 'David', 'Kelley', 'boy', 'mother', 'death', 'Add', 'mix', 'piquant', 'dashes', 'blessed', 'good', 'chemistry', 'rough-necked', 'Texan', 'con', 'artist', 'self-centered', 'young', 'woman', 'brother', 'young', 'Korean', 'couple', 'unmarried', 'Australian', 'woman', 'give', 'birth', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'won', 'lottery', 'weird', 'circumstances', 'have', 'here', 'show', 'bar', 'network', 'TV', 'entertainment.What', 'series', 'additionally', 'so', 'appealing', 'atmosphere', 'somewhat', 'undeniable', 'supernatural', 'factor', 'Indeed', 'almost', 'island', 'were', 'alive', 'entity', 'possessed', 'soul', 'many', 'weeks', 'gone', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', '12-hour', 'night', 'shifts', 'quite', 'lot', 'so', 'ultimately', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'relay', 'co-workers', 'many', 'extraordinary', 'virtues', 'series', 'course', 'then', 'naturally', 'much', 'persuasion', 'began', 'behest', 'bring', 'LOST', 'DVD', 'set', 'work', 'play', 'chance', 'would', 'have', 'endeavoring', 'watch', 'episode', 'two', 'down-time', 'breaks', 'colleagues', 'became', 'as', 'hooked', 'was', 'actually', 'derived', 'much', 'pleasure', 're-perusing', 'found', 'laughing', 'heartily', 'places', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'singled', 'out', 'so', 'amusing', 'when', 'watching', 'alone', ""'ve"", 'found', 'so', 'many', 'inklings', 're-viewing', 'even', 'outright', 'portents', 'whole', 'make', 'owning', 'set', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'Truly', 'such', 'great', 'ingenious', 'story', 'weaving', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'divined', 'had', 'not', 'gone', 'again', 'Oh', 'yes-', 'one', 'can', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'assured', 'coming', 'crave', 'intrigue', 'tales', 'episodes', 'tell', 'well', 'present', 'season', 'be', 'enchanted', 'still', 'many', 'separate', 'fates', 'wonderfully', 'captivating', 'vastly', 'intriguing', 'LOST', 'beings', 'isle']",Lost - The Complete First Season
632770,A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8,B00005JNOG,Adam,"[5, 5]","I'm a somewhat recent convert to Lost.  After hearing fans of the show carry on about it at work and elsewhere, I just didn't see what could possibly be appealing about the show and refused to watch it.  Then an acquaintance of mine recommended I simply take the ""Lost Challenge"" - watch only the first disc of season 1 (about 4 episodes are on each disc, if I recall correctly), and see if you aren't hooked.  He boldly claimed that he knew of noone who had taken the challenge that had not become a convert.  I was skeptical - but after watching the first disc, I was in fact hooked, and I completed season 1 in about 2 weeks and subsequently purchased Season 2 as soon as it was released on DVD.First, what I don't like (and why I initially resisted for so long): The entire premise of the show is utterly ridiculous and cheesy.  There's nothing about it that's remotely realistic.  The acting is ok at best.  The island contains about 45 inhabitants, 10-15 of whom are charactars and the remainder are essentially extras with no dialogue (although they'll occasionally have a line here or there).  Most of the characters, also, just aren't that believable.Yet, after 4-5 episodes, I was glued to the TV.  The reason, I suspect, is that it's extremely suspenseful - there are always 3-4 plotlines going on at once, and there's a cliffhanger around every corner.  It's sort of like Fox's 24, or even the novel The Da Vinci Code, in the sense that it feeds you information one little morsel at a time and every answer seems to lead only to more questions.  For this reason, despite all its flaws, Lost is highly entertaining to the point of being addictive.If you're not already a fan of Lost, I'd highly recommend taking the Lost Challenge - buy season 1 (or borrow the first disc, I'm sure you know someone who has the set) and watch disc 1.  Do that, and I'll wager you'll be hooked.One note, I think shows like Lost are much more enjoyable to watch on DVD than on TV.  The plot is highly involved and it's much more satisfying to watch an entire season in a relatively short timeframe versus watching one episode a week with a 2-3 month gap in the middle of the season, as they subjected us to in Season 3.EDIT: Damnit, I meant to give it 4 stars, not 5, and that's the one thing it won't let you go back and edit.  Oh well, it is highly recommend, just not in the upper echelon I like to limit my 5 star ratings to.",5,"If you haven't already, take the ""Lost Challenge""",1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,2421,"[""'m"", 'somewhat', 'recent', 'convert', 'Lost', 'hearing', 'fans', 'show', 'carry', 'work', 'elsewhere', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'appealing', 'show', 'refused', 'watch', 'Then', 'acquaintance', 'mine', 'recommended', 'simply', 'take', 'Lost', 'Challenge', 'watch', 'only', 'first', 'disc', 'season', '1', '4', 'episodes', 'are', 'disc', 'recall', 'correctly', 'see', 'are', ""n't"", 'hooked', 'boldly', 'claimed', 'knew', 'noone', 'who', 'had', 'taken', 'challenge', 'had', 'not', 'become', 'convert', 'was', 'skeptical', 'watching', 'first', 'disc', 'was', 'fact', 'hooked', 'completed', 'season', '1', 'about', '2', 'weeks', 'subsequently', 'purchased', 'Season', '2', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'released', 'DVD.First', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'why', 'initially', 'resisted', 'so', 'long', 'entire', 'premise', 'show', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'cheesy', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'realistic', 'acting', 'ok', 'best', 'island', '45', 'inhabitants', '10-15', 'whom', 'are', 'charactars', 'remainder', 'are', 'essentially', 'extras', 'dialogue', ""'ll"", 'occasionally', 'have', 'line', 'here', 'there', 'Most', 'characters', 'also', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'believable.Yet', '4-5', 'episodes', 'was', 'glued', 'TV', 'reason', 'suspect', 'extremely', 'suspenseful', 'are', 'always', '3-4', 'plotlines', 'going', 'once', 'cliffhanger', 'corner', 'sort', 'Fox', '24', 'even', 'novel', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'sense', 'information', 'one', 'little', 'morsel', 'time', 'answer', 'lead', 'only', 'more', 'questions', 'reason', 'flaws', 'Lost', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'point', 'being', 'addictive.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'already', 'fan', 'Lost', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'taking', 'Lost', 'Challenge', 'buy', 'season', '1', 'borrow', 'first', 'disc', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'set', 'watch', 'disc', '1', 'Do', ""'ll"", 'wager', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked.One', 'note', 'think', 'shows', 'Lost', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'DVD', 'TV', 'plot', 'highly', 'involved', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'watch', 'entire', 'season', 'relatively', 'short', 'timeframe', 'watching', 'one', 'episode', 'week', '2-3', 'month', 'gap', 'middle', 'season', 'subjected', 'Season', '3.EDIT', 'Damnit', 'meant', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'not', '5', 'one', 'thing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'back', 'edit', 'Oh', 'well', 'highly', 'recommend', 'just', 'not', 'upper', 'echelon', 'like', 'limit', '5', 'star', 'ratings']",Lost - The Complete First Season

632772,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B00005JNOG,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[1, 1]","To me, LOST is the best TV series of the third millennium, so far. Prison Break comes as a closed second and Heroes is closely behind. I am very surprised that TV series can be made this good these days when cost cutting and declining standards seems to be the norm everywhere else. But, not in the world of television, it seems.LOST employs a cast of dozens to tell a big story. How big the story is? I don't know yet, it seems that we could have another 10 seasons and not come close to an end. But, slowly, what begins as your run of the mill airliner crash survivors story keeps adding layers on top of layers, expands, branches out in unexpected directions and, episode after episode after episodes keeps us mesmerized, guessing, mourning those lost and left behind, surprised, intrigued and always ready for more.The first season starts a bit slowly and, speaking for myself, I didn't care much for the first couple of episodes. I will not reveal the plot but, it's probably proper to note that you are going to see peoples struggling to overcome extreme circumstances, stories of friendship, solidarity, spontaneous cooperation, the inevitable conflicts between people of many different upbringings, chasing different dreams, sometimes competing for the same rewards. Facing danger, the unknown and, what appears to be, the incomprehensible, the initial state of anarchy spontaneously gains textures and a fragile structure.The first season is mostly about our heroes' survival and their struggle to go back to what used to be the `normal' life. Scenes of life and struggle on the island are often interrupted by increasingly disturbing flashbacks and puzzling hints that little that's going on is accidental, random or `normal'. The survivors are tied to each other in most surprising ways and, little by little, the supernatural, the mysterious and the plain unbelievable begin to manifest. We learn that the island is not what it seemed to be. There are monsters and unexpected beasts roaming in the woods, there are hints of other inhabitants and the familiar laws of nature don't seem to always apply.LOST has an incredibly well-written story line, great acting and it's shown to us in the highest quality picture and sound. It is, without a doubt, one of the best TV series I've watched in a long, long time. If you haven't watched the weekly episodes on TV, you should consider yourself lucky. I haven't either and I am glad I didn't have to wait, week after week, for yet another mystery to solve itself in the next episodes.If, after watching the first season, you felt it was entertainment time well spent, then you should definitely acquire the subsequent seasons because it only gets better. A LOT BETTER. Seriously.Oh, and talking about viewing addiction, it took me a couple of weeks to devour Season One. As I was done with it, Amazon made available a Seasons 1-3 bundle and I bought that. I finished seasons 2 and 3 in the next couple of weeks. Season 4? It only took me 2 nights.Oh, and, one more thing that you should keep in mind - but you will constantly fail at it: NOTHING is what what it seems to be and nobody is what he/she claims to be.Happy viewing :)",5,Welcome to your future viewing addiction :),1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,3185,"['LOST', 'best', 'TV', 'series', 'third', 'millennium', 'so', 'far', 'Prison', 'Break', 'closed', 'second', 'Heroes', 'closely', 'am', 'very', 'surprised', 'TV', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'good', 'days', 'when', 'cost', 'cutting', 'declining', 'standards', 'be', 'norm', 'everywhere', 'else', 'not', 'world', 'television', 'seems.LOST', 'cast', 'dozens', 'tell', 'big', 'story', 'How', 'big', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'could', 'have', '10', 'seasons', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'end', 'slowly', 'what', 'run', 'mill', 'airliner', 'crash', 'survivors', 'story', 'adding', 'layers', 'top', 'layers', 'expands', 'branches', 'out', 'unexpected', 'directions', 'episode', 'episode', 'episodes', 'keeps', 'mesmerized', 'guessing', 'mourning', 'lost', 'left', 'behind', 'surprised', 'intrigued', 'always', 'ready', 'more.The', 'first', 'season', 'bit', 'slowly', 'speaking', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'plot', 'probably', 'proper', 'note', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'peoples', 'struggling', 'overcome', 'extreme', 'circumstances', 'stories', 'friendship', 'solidarity', 'spontaneous', 'cooperation', 'inevitable', 'conflicts', 'people', 'many', 'different', 'upbringings', 'chasing', 'different', 'dreams', 'sometimes', 'competing', 'same', 'rewards', 'Facing', 'danger', 'unknown', 'what', 'be', 'incomprehensible', 'initial', 'state', 'anarchy', 'spontaneously', 'gains', 'textures', 'fragile', 'structure.The', 'first', 'season', 'mostly', 'heroes', 'survival', 'struggle', 'go', 'back', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'normal', 'life', 'Scenes', 'life', 'struggle', 'island', 'are', 'often', 'interrupted', 'increasingly', 'disturbing', 'flashbacks', 'puzzling', 'hints', 'little', 'going', 'accidental', 'random', 'normal', 'survivors', 'are', 'tied', 'other', 'most', 'surprising', 'ways', 'little', 'little', 'supernatural', 'mysterious', 'plain', 'unbelievable', 'begin', 'manifest', 'learn', 'island', 'not', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'are', 'monsters', 'unexpected', 'beasts', 'roaming', 'woods', 'are', 'hints', 'other', 'inhabitants', 'familiar', 'laws', 'nature', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'always', 'apply.LOST', 'incredibly', 'well-written', 'story', 'line', 'great', 'acting', 'shown', 'highest', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'series', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'weekly', 'episodes', 'TV', 'should', 'consider', 'lucky', 'have', ""n't"", 'either', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'week', 'week', 'yet', 'mystery', 'solve', 'next', 'episodes.If', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'felt', 'was', 'entertainment', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'then', 'should', 'definitely', 'acquire', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'only', 'better', 'LOT', 'BETTER', 'Seriously.Oh', 'talking', 'viewing', 'addiction', 'took', 'couple', 'weeks', 'devour', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'done', 'Amazon', 'made', 'available', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'bundle', 'bought', 'finished', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'next', 'couple', 'weeks', 'Season', '4', 'only', 'took', '2', 'nights.Oh', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'will', 'constantly', 'fail', 'NOTHING', 'what', 'what', 'be', 'nobody', 'what', 'he/she', 'be.Happy', 'viewing']",Lost - The Complete First Season

I like the ensemble cast and the ability it creates to tell a variety of stories as the backgrounds of various survivors are revealed. The episodes are a bit uneven, but for the most part they are intelligent and creative. The overall story, the cement that holds it all together, is intriguing. I'm a little worried that the explanation for the island will turn out to be supernatural -- that seems foreshadowed by all the talk of fate and destiny -- but enough of the episodes are exciting and touching and unexpected that I'm more than willing to move on to season 2.The acting is generally excellent. Initially I thought that Matthew Fox, playing Jack, was a bit wooden, but he grew on me as the season progressed. One measure of the quality of the acting (and writing) is that my favorite character kept changing from episode to episode. Most of the featured characters have greater depth than television writers usually manage. While the island's mysterious threat creates tension, the story's drama is rooted in the way the characters interact with each other and, in the process, learn about themselves. The writers wrote some real emotion into these stories, usually without becoming cheesy.",5,"Exciting, touching, unexpected",1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,1433,"['Having', 'just', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'who', 'think', 'best', 'TV', 'show', 'ever', 'certainly', 'enjoyable', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'what', 'entertainment', 'commercial', 'television', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'ability', 'tell', 'variety', 'stories', 'backgrounds', 'various', 'survivors', 'are', 'revealed', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'uneven', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'intelligent', 'creative', 'overall', 'story', 'cement', 'together', 'intriguing', ""'m"", 'little', 'worried', 'explanation', 'island', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'supernatural', 'foreshadowed', 'talk', 'fate', 'destiny', 'episodes', 'are', 'exciting', 'touching', 'unexpected', ""'m"", 'more', 'willing', 'move', 'season', '2.The', 'acting', 'generally', 'excellent', 'Initially', 'thought', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'playing', 'Jack', 'was', 'bit', 'wooden', 'grew', 'season', 'progressed', 'One', 'measure', 'quality', 'acting', 'writing', 'favorite', 'character', 'kept', 'changing', 'episode', 'episode', 'Most', 'featured', 'characters', 'have', 'greater', 'depth', 'television', 'writers', 'usually', 'manage', 'island', 'mysterious', 'threat', 'tension', 'story', 'drama', 'rooted', 'way', 'characters', 'interact', 'other', 'process', 'learn', 'writers', 'wrote', 'real', 'emotion', 'stories', 'usually', 'becoming', 'cheesy']",Lost - The Complete First Season

632790,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005JNOG,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[8, 8]","When I first saw promos for ABC's Lost, I was very skeptical about how the writers were going to carry on a show about people stranded on a tropical island for a few years, let alone only a season.  I thought that there was only so many stories they could do if this was a serious drama.  The show premiered to rave reviews, but I never had the time to watch.  Then one of my friends told me a little bit about the show, and it sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try.  Oh man, is this ever a good show, and was I ever wrong about problems with stories!  In an inspired move, every episode focuses on a character, and shows scenes from their life in flashback (except for the pilot and season finale episodes, which show scenes of multiple characters).  These flashbacks reveal defining moments in the characters' lives that show why they act the way they do on the island.  With a main cast of 14 people (or castaways), there are a lot of interesting, sad, and dark stories to tell.Minor spoilers below.When we meet the characters in the pilot, we think we know them, but when we see their flashbacks, we get the rug pulled out from under our feet, for no one is who they seem to be.  While about 48 people survived, only 14 are focused upon.  The 14 main castaways are: Jack (Matthew Fox), a heroic doctor, Kate (Evangeline Lilly), a shy girl who develops a crush on Jack, Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), a British rocker with a drug problem, Hurley (Jorge Garcia), a large man with a large heart, Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) and his wife Sun (Yujin Kim), a Korean couple who initially isolate themselves from the rest of the group, Claire (Emilie de Ravin), a pregnant Australian woman without a father for her unborn baby, Sawyer (Josh Holloway), a low-life who hoards the supplies from the wrecked plane so that he can barter them with the people who need them, Michael (Harold Perrineau) and his son Walt (Malcolm David Kelley), who have just been reunited after Walt's mother died, Boone (Ian Somerhalder) and his sister Shannon (Maggie Grace), who constantly bicker, Sayid (Naveen Andrews), an Iraqi who fought against the US in the Gulf War and is attacked due to racism, and finally Locke (Terry O'Quinn), a mysterious man who doesn't seem to mind being stuck on the island.  Of course, those are the characters that we think we meet in the pilot episodes.  The people that they truly are become revealed over the course of the season.In addition to learning about the castaways' pasts, their present situation is dealt with superbly as well.  In the first few episodes, they run out of food and water, and they have to figure out what to do.  Later on, they discover that they aren't alone on the island when Sayid meets Rousseau (Mira Furlan), a French woman who's been on the island for 16 years and claims that there are ""Others"" on the island who plot against her.  When mysterious things begin happening to the islanders, they begin to suspect that Rousseau is right.However, there are a fair share of miraculous events that occur that aren't the work of the Others.  I'm not going to spoil any of them, as they are too good to reveal in this review.  There are also plenty of mysteries on the island that keep both the characters and the audience perplexed.  What exactly do the others want?  What is the significance of the black and white rocks?  Why are there polar bears on a tropical island?

When I first heard the premise - a group of people crash land on an island - my first thought was just how far can this show go?  I mean, you crash on an island and then it's fictional ""Survivor"".

I sat down to watch an episode or two and before I knew it was five in the morning. I think the first season is my favorite season in this series. It is just amazing, it is the perfect blend of action, drama, science fiction and horror, the series have the ability to captivate the audience, it draws you into it's world and make you sit on the edge of your eat glued to the TV.Most of you that read this review have probably already seen the series or at least know what it is about, but if you do not then let me tell you the basic premise of the plot. A plane crashes on an unknown, mysterious island and the few dozen survivors have to try to find a way to make it on the island until they are rescued. Soon strange and paranormal things starts to happen, however this is all presented in a so subtle way that it is hard to know what is really going on. The episodes all belong to one huge storyline that spend the length of the entire series, however each episode also have a theme. The episodes is divided half between life on the island and half between backflashes to the lives of the various characters before the crash, the main character changes with each episode.Lost is a series that can be enjoyed by a wide variety of audiences, allot of it is drama as the survivors form friendships, love affairs and make enemies, but a part of it is also science fiction or horror. When I was trying to describe the show to my fience I told him that Lost played like Survivor meets Call of Cthulhu or to make another comparison along the same lines, it is like Survivor meets The Twilight Zone.Lost have a huge cast of characters and they are all nicely fleshed out, as the season progresses one get to care about these people, they are all flawed but also have redeeming factors just like real people. The actors really do a good job with this one. The picture quality is great and the show is filmed in beautiful locations, the music is pretty good to. Lost moves very slowly and this is both it's strength and it's weakness, you are left wondering through the entire series so this is not a show for you if your are impatient, however if you like your science fiction presented in a leisurely manner with subtle hints and plots withing plots storylines then Lost is right for you.Season 1 of Lost is a great first season to a fantastic show. I have watched it several times and I find something new to enjoy every time. This is a quality box set that I think most people no matter their tastes in films and TV series can enjoy.

Half of the season literally takes place before the survivors ended up on the island. Sure it all comes in bits and peices but it seemed that the season went too slow developing events on the island.

Many of the shows and movies that command the #1 (or #2, or #3) spot on TV leave me wondering if I'm some sort of defective for disliking what everyone else apparently adores. For once, I'm a part of the group: I like Lost. It's not the best show I've ever seen, but the productions values are very nice, the plot is interesting, and the characters are likeable without being perfect (morally, at least; physically they are still mostly too pretty for the real world. Which is why they live on TV...but I digress.)Other good things: a willingness to tackle issues most TV shows wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole and a Siberian tiger pushing, an amazing cast, and have I mentioned the writing? The camera work is fantastic! I realy love the cinematography and the flasbacks, for once in a show, are an actual treat which I anticipate instead of the usual filler and annoyances. I love that the intro isn't some 5 minuite music video advertisement, but a 5 second clip of the title - that's so cool it gives me shivvers. And I love the setting. It's lovely.My one fear is that it'll all end in disgusted fans. A show like this must have a fitting end, a conclusion, a finale. You can't keep going just because your ratings are up and people will buy it. You have a plot with mysteries - as every mystery fan knows, there is a time and a place for everything, and all myseries must be solved.So - as much as I love the show - until it ends I'll worry. If they do it right, and end it, then come up with another show with the same high production values and excellent writing the producer and director will have gained a big credit account with me, and I'll be a devoted and trusting fan. If they draw it out and mess it up and get tangled I'll chalk it up as another great idea ruined by shoddy execution and go back to watching my reruns.",4,"Now, let's see if they can finish it.",1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,1893,"['am', 'traditionally', 'wary', 'extremely', 'popular', 'things', 'Many', 'shows', 'movies', 'command', '1', '2', '3', 'spot', 'TV', 'leave', 'wondering', ""'m"", 'sort', 'defective', 'disliking', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'apparently', 'once', ""'m"", 'part', 'group', 'like', 'Lost', 'not', 'best', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'productions', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'plot', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'being', 'perfect', 'morally', 'least', 'physically', 'are', 'still', 'mostly', 'too', 'pretty', 'real', 'world', 'Which', 'why', 'live', 'TV', 'digress', 'Other', 'good', 'things', 'willingness', 'tackle', 'issues', 'most', 'TV', 'shows', 'would', ""n't"", 'touch', 'ten', 'foot', 'pole', 'Siberian', 'tiger', 'pushing', 'amazing', 'cast', 'have', 'mentioned', 'writing', 'camera', 'work', 'fantastic', 'realy', 'love', 'cinematography', 'flasbacks', 'once', 'show', 'are', 'actual', 'treat', 'anticipate', 'instead', 'usual', 'filler', 'annoyances', 'love', 'intro', ""n't"", '5', 'minuite', 'music', 'video', 'advertisement', '5', 'second', 'clip', 'title', 'so', 'cool', 'shivvers', 'love', 'setting', 'lovely.My', 'one', 'fear', ""'ll"", 'end', 'disgusted', 'fans', 'show', 'must', 'have', 'fitting', 'end', 'conclusion', 'finale', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'going', 'just', 'ratings', 'are', 'up', 'people', 'will', 'buy', 'have', 'plot', 'mysteries', 'mystery', 'fan', 'time', 'place', 'everything', 'myseries', 'must', 'be', 'solved.So', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'show', ""'ll"", 'worry', 'do', 'right', 'end', 'then', 'come', 'up', 'show', 'same', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'excellent', 'writing', 'producer', 'director', 'will', 'have', 'gained', 'big', 'credit', 'account', ""'ll"", 'be', 'devoted', 'trusting', 'fan', 'draw', 'out', 'mess', 'up', 'get', 'tangled', ""'ll"", 'chalk', 'up', 'great', 'idea', 'ruined', 'shoddy', 'execution', 'go', 'back', 'watching', 'reruns']",Lost - The Complete First Season

She said they spent more than 5 million dollars to shoot the pilot and gave me the tape of the pilot to watch.Having watched a lot of TV in my life I thought, well, it will be from OK to Good. I mean what can surprise me and especially the story was about plane crash and survivors, seemed I saw it somewhere before.After watching the pilot I can say with confidence that this is probably one of the best (if not the best) pilot episodes ever filmed. And after watching every episode so far I can say this show is the best show I've seen in a long time. I basically wait from episode to episode waiting for what will happen.What I like about this show is the stories, the actors, the characters and the sets. This is truly a well made show. Every episode masterfully crafted, I can't even say there is a lame episode. It's Drama with a splash of science fiction(?) and mystery.The acting is superb by name and no-name actors. You will get attached to the characters even the ones you wouldn't like in real life. Everything is believable yet creative and inventive. The flashbacks are fantastic and while I usually don't like them, here, I did like them, they are inserted into the mix with ease and continuity that will lead you to the climax of every episode.While the flashback tell you about past lives of the survivors, new stories develop and problems arise from their situations and conflict between different characters who wouldn't be together in real life. It is just fantastic story telling.The sets are magnificent. The show is filming in Hawaii although they could've used a sound stage. I believe all the filming was done outdoors in Hawaii (except some of the flashbacks) No show I can remember did this for it can be a bit expensive.I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who didn't watch yet, but start watching, and buy the DVD when it's out. You'll love it. The idea of solving the puzzle of why and how every passenger got on that Oceanc flight 815 is alone worth your watching time. Also, for me, the math aspect and some logical problems are enjoyable as well; I just hope they don't disappoint us at the end but I doubt it. As one of the producers said ""The last thing we want to do on LOST is be illogical"". I trust him.I write this review as I await the finale episode; while I downloaded some episode I missed, and probably could download the entire season, I have every intention of buying this DVD when it comes out as a thank you to the producers for such a good ... well, product.",5,I found what I've been looking for and its LOST,1116892800,"05 24, 2005",2005,2625,"['review', 'show', 'not', 'unreleased', 'DVD.A', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'fan', 'show', 'told', 'said', 'spent', 'more', '5', 'million', 'dollars', 'shoot', 'pilot', 'gave', 'tape', 'pilot', 'watch.Having', 'watched', 'lot', 'TV', 'life', 'thought', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'OK', 'Good', 'mean', 'what', 'can', 'surprise', 'especially', 'story', 'was', 'plane', 'crash', 'survivors', 'seemed', 'saw', 'somewhere', 'before.After', 'watching', 'pilot', 'can', 'say', 'confidence', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'pilot', 'episodes', 'ever', 'filmed', 'watching', 'episode', 'far', 'can', 'say', 'show', 'best', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'basically', 'wait', 'episode', 'episode', 'waiting', 'what', 'will', 'happen.What', 'like', 'show', 'stories', 'actors', 'characters', 'sets', 'truly', 'well', 'made', 'show', 'episode', 'masterfully', 'crafted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'lame', 'episode', 'Drama', 'splash', 'science', 'fiction', 'acting', 'superb', 'name', 'no-name', 'actors', 'will', 'get', 'attached', 'characters', 'even', 'ones', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'real', 'life', 'Everything', 'believable', 'yet', 'creative', 'inventive', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'fantastic', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'here', 'did', 'like', 'are', 'inserted', 'mix', 'ease', 'continuity', 'will', 'lead', 'climax', 'flashback', 'tell', 'past', 'lives', 'survivors', 'new', 'stories', 'develop', 'problems', 'arise', 'situations', 'conflict', 'different', 'characters', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'together', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'fantastic', 'story', 'telling.The', 'sets', 'are', 'magnificent', 'show', 'filming', 'Hawaii', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'sound', 'stage', 'believe', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'outdoors', 'Hawaii', 'flashbacks', 'show', 'can', 'remember', 'did', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'expensive.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'anyone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'yet', 'start', 'watching', 'buy', 'DVD', 'when', 'out', ""'ll"", 'love', 'idea', 'solving', 'puzzle', 'why', 'how', 'passenger', 'got', 'Oceanc', 'flight', '815', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'time', 'Also', 'math', 'aspect', 'logical', 'problems', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'just', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'end', 'doubt', 'one', 'producers', 'said', 'last', 'thing', 'want', 'do', 'LOST', 'be', 'illogical', 'trust', 'him.I', 'write', 'review', 'await', 'finale', 'episode', 'downloaded', 'episode', 'missed', 'probably', 'could', 'download', 'entire', 'season', 'have', 'intention', 'buying', 'DVD', 'when', 'out', 'thank', 'producers', 'such', 'good', 'well', 'product']",Lost - The Complete First Season

It was so exciting. TV was exciting again.I have to add in retrospect that the second season was disappointing because it seemed the writers were unsure of which direction to go, and they just kept adding mystery after mystery, leaving us with endless questions. I stopped watching after Season 2 because the series could not live up to its first season's promises (and the seasons were getting alarmingly shorter anyway).As for season one, well, for a bunch of Wednesday evenings in 2004, I was absolutely enthralled. I actually looked forward to a television program; a drama, no less. But in the back of my mind there was a seed of doubt.

Moore,"[5, 5]","I normally don't watch television at all, and I was completely and utterly unprepared for the quality of storytelling going on in this series by both the acting and the writing.  I missed the entire first season on TV because it was somehow marketed as if it were a reality-ish show or something.  Something about the previews turned me off.  After hearing a friend mention the show offhandedly, I decided to give it a shot and got this DVD.  I'm so happy I did.I started watching this Season 1 DVD a week before season 2 began to air, and after seeing only a few episodes, I was completely hooked.  If you have plans for Wednesday nights at 8 CST already, then you better not buy this DVD, because one viewing and you'll be hooked.  Even good TV shows (of which I only watch 2 regularly) are not usually DVD-purchase worthy in my book.  However, this brilliantly constructed show is teeming with easter eggs, clues, hints and red herrings that toy with your emotions and understanding of who the characters are, what they will do next, and what the island will do to them next.If you're a fan of mysteries, science, and meaningful character development, don't miss this series.  It has very high rewatchability, and this season stands as a shining pillar of light in a muddy pool of recycled sit coms and soap operas.  It really has something for everyone.  Some of my friends watch to see who will hook up.  Others, like me, watch to see how the plot and mysteries will unfold.  That's probably one reason it is so popular.Just don't use the numbers for the lottery.  On the last huge draw for Powerball, over 800 people picked 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.  If you do win with them, the jackpot would have to be immense in order for you to get a decent share!  I saw a recent Irish lotto drawing that used 7 numbers, and matched 5 - all but the 42 from this series.  Normally an average of 50 people match 5 in that Irish lottery, and that has been established over thousands of drawings.  The day the lotto matched 5 of these 6 numbers, 298 people won.  That's IRELAND.It's a testament to the power of this series.  If you don't usually like TV, give this show a chance.

632812,A2BW9U1CSLIHJX,B00005JNOG,Big Erik,"[5, 7]","Having seen about half of an episode (the one dealing with Sawyer's first flashbacks), I was hooked enough to buy the entire season for my girlfriend's birthday.  I'm normally a little skeptical of anything on TV not created by HBO, but rest assured, this DVD is worth the money and more.  The basic structure of the show, following the double-episode pilot which introduces all the characters and the thrilling post-crash incidents, is to use 3/4 of the running time on events occuring within the island, and about 1/4 on flashbacks regarding a specific character.  To say the least, this structure works out beautifully.  The cinematography, acting, and especially the writing is on par with the best you'll see in any television serial or movie these days.  However, these compliments are not without concerns.  The quality of this show goes through a very specific shift, from great to good, following the completion of the fourth disc (there are six in total and 24 episodes).I'd like to focus first on the great four discs that begin the show, or 16 episodes.  In these, the cinematography and acting are absolutely amazing.  The events on the island are varied and consistently fascinating, and the ensemble cast is handled somewhwere in the level of mastery.  The viewer never knows what to expect, or what will happen next, and beyond that, there are a plethora of well-acted, believable characters that are certain to have their own respective fan-following.  Taking this to the next level, however, are the flashbacks sequences.  These minute to two minute scenes, sprinkled across each and every episode, transcend regular television and truly blew me away.  Instead of being cliched scenes that fit the characters into blocks, they were complex, expertly written pieces that were sometimes borderline heartbreaking, sometimes simply gripping character studies.  Think of a small, perfectly crafted art-house film sandwiched in between a well-made suspense/adventure series, and that's the way every episode on those first four discs felt.  Literally, the first 16 episodes, and for sure the first 12, are astounding feats of television.  I remember looking at my girlfriend and saying, ""this is better than Sopranos, and there isn't a single weak episode.""Unfortunately, these things changed.  It's hard to determine why, but the series sent certain characters on second flashbacks, and they suddenly began to loose their powerful, well-acted hold and began to jump into the realm of melodrama.  Furthering the problem was that the events on the island became way too plot-oriented, and there was more and more of characters acting like puppets for the forwarding the plot instead of acting three-dimensional like they did before.  Also, the three main plot elements...the existence of ""others,"" the identity of the violent creature, and the truth behind the ""hatch"" in the ground...none of these were ever uncovered.  I understand the need to build this into a second season and beyond, but after 24 episodes there should be SOME revelations regarding everything the first half hinted at.  Don't expect ANY revelations in this first season...or at least not much.  Despite these disappointments, the last part of the first season was still good and even gripping, but it just didn't touch upon the professional, almost mesmerizing quality of the first four discs.  Again, it's hard to explain exactly why, but the series just slipped up a little bit.  Not much--but enough to notice.  Nevertheless, I would recommend the DVD set for the show as a whole and especially for the superior quality of the first four discs, which borders on expertise film-making, acting, and writing.  Think of it as owning 16 perfect mini-movies...regardless of the final product.  Just don't be surprised when the melodrama and vagueness takes over a little at the end.  Here's hoping that the second season began how the first did--and not how it ended.",5,From Great to Good,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,3948,"['Having', 'seen', 'half', 'episode', 'one', 'dealing', 'Sawyer', 'first', 'flashbacks', 'was', 'hooked', 'enough', 'buy', 'entire', 'season', 'girlfriend', 'birthday', ""'m"", 'normally', 'little', 'skeptical', 'anything', 'TV', 'not', 'created', 'HBO', 'rest', 'assured', 'DVD', 'money', 'more', 'basic', 'structure', 'show', 'following', 'double-episode', 'pilot', 'characters', 'thrilling', 'post-crash', 'incidents', 'use', '3/4', 'running', 'time', 'events', 'occuring', 'island', 'about', '1/4', 'flashbacks', 'regarding', 'specific', 'character', 'say', 'least', 'structure', 'out', 'beautifully', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'especially', 'writing', 'par', 'best', ""'ll"", 'see', 'television', 'serial', 'movie', 'days', 'However', 'compliments', 'are', 'not', 'concerns', 'quality', 'show', 'very', 'specific', 'shift', 'great', 'good', 'following', 'completion', 'fourth', 'disc', 'are', 'six', 'total', '24', 'episodes', '.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'focus', 'first', 'great', 'four', 'discs', 'begin', 'show', '16', 'episodes', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'are', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'events', 'island', 'are', 'varied', 'consistently', 'fascinating', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'handled', 'somewhwere', 'level', 'mastery', 'viewer', 'never', 'what', 'expect', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'are', 'plethora', 'well-acted', 'believable', 'characters', 'are', 'certain', 'have', 'own', 'respective', 'fan-following', 'Taking', 'next', 'level', 'however', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'sequences', 'minute', 'two', 'minute', 'scenes', 'sprinkled', 'episode', 'transcend', 'regular', 'television', 'truly', 'blew', 'away', 'Instead', 'being', 'cliched', 'scenes', 'fit', 'characters', 'blocks', 'were', 'complex', 'expertly', 'written', 'pieces', 'were', 'sometimes', 'borderline', 'heartbreaking', 'sometimes', 'simply', 'gripping', 'character', 'studies', 'Think', 'small', 'perfectly', 'crafted', 'art-house', 'film', 'sandwiched', 'well-made', 'suspense/adventure', 'series', 'way', 'episode', 'first', 'four', 'discs', 'felt', 'Literally', 'first', '16', 'episodes', 'sure', 'first', '12', 'are', 'astounding', 'feats', 'television', 'remember', 'looking', 'girlfriend', 'saying', 'better', 'Sopranos', ""n't"", 'single', 'weak', 'episode', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'changed', 'hard', 'determine', 'why', 'series', 'sent', 'certain', 'characters', 'second', 'flashbacks', 'suddenly', 'began', 'loose', 'powerful', 'well-acted', 'hold', 'began', 'jump', 'realm', 'melodrama', 'Furthering', 'problem', 'was', 'events', 'island', 'became', 'way', 'too', 'plot-oriented', 'there', 'was', 'more', 'more', 'characters', 'acting', 'puppets', 'forwarding', 'plot', 'instead', 'acting', 'three-dimensional', 'did', 'before', 'Also', 'three', 'main', 'plot', 'elements', 'existence', 'others', 'identity', 'violent', 'creature', 'truth', 'hatch', 'ground', 'none', 'were', 'ever', 'uncovered', 'understand', 'need', 'build', 'second', 'season', '24', 'episodes', 'there', 'should', 'be', 'SOME', 'revelations', 'regarding', 'everything', 'first', 'half', 'hinted', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'ANY', 'revelations', 'first', 'season', 'least', 'not', 'much', 'disappointments', 'last', 'part', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'even', 'gripping', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'touch', 'professional', 'almost', 'mesmerizing', 'quality', 'first', 'four', 'discs', 'Again', 'hard', 'explain', 'exactly', 'why', 'series', 'just', 'slipped', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'Not', 'much', 'enough', 'notice', 'Nevertheless', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'show', 'whole', 'especially', 'superior', 'quality', 'first', 'four', 'discs', 'expertise', 'film-making', 'acting', 'writing', 'Think', 'owning', '16', 'perfect', 'mini-movies', 'regardless', 'final', 'product', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'melodrama', 'vagueness', 'over', 'little', 'end', 'Here', 'hoping', 'second', 'season', 'began', 'how', 'first', 'did', 'not', 'how', 'ended']",Lost - The Complete First Season

632818,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B00005JNOG,B. Martin,"[2, 3]","I think that when the final season of Lost wraps up in May 2010, the show will end up being viewed more as a full body of work to be revisted and immersed in again and again than as a series of individual seasons.  It's going to be an example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.  Much like the Lord of the Rings films and the Harry Potter books, Lost is going to be one complete viewing experience.  I don't know many other shows in the history of the medium that can say that.  Viewed individually, each season has its flaws, but as a whole, this is going to be a series for the ages.Season 1, which earned the show an emmy as best dramatic series, is probably the most popular of the series' run.  It sets up the plot:  a group of strangers survive a plane crash and must figure out how to survive on a tropical island.  But right from the start, it's clear that this isn't going to be a mere rehash of Lord of the Flies, Robinson Crusoe, Castaway, etc., although elements of those works are certainly present.  There is a mysterious monster running amok in the jungle, a polar bear attacks the castaways and a distress call from an unknown French woman which has been playing continuously for 16 years is discovered.  As Charlie says, ""Guys, where are we?"".A good question, indeed.  The first season slowly builds on this mystery.  As the episodes unfold we learn that the island is inhabited by mysterious ""others"", the French woman who created the distress signal is located, a mysterious metal hatch is found in the jungle and a series of cryptic numbers come into play.  Oh, and at least one miracle occurs there.  Confused?  You haven't seen anything yet.But don't worry.  Lost isn't just some elaborate puzzle box.  It can be enjoyed in various ways.  It is an engrossing action/adventure story, a rich character study, an examination of the themes of destiny and redemption and a head scratching mystery.  The show also rewards repeated viewings since pop culture references and other clues which may point to the show's ultimate destination are scattered throughout.Season 1 focuses largely on fleshing out the major characters:  Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley, Locke, Sun, Jin, Syaid, etc.  Each has secrets and, ultimately, a reason for being on the island that they don't fully understand.  Flashbacks fill in the details of their past lives leading up to the fateful crash.Think of season one as the opening chapter.  The introduction to a novel as it were.  But be patient.  The show, just like the island, is not going to reveal its secrets until it's good and ready.  In the meantime, enjoy the ride.  We may never see anything like this again.",5,And so it begins.....,1248912000,"07 30, 2009",2009,2676,"['think', 'when', 'final', 'season', 'Lost', 'wraps', 'up', 'May', '2010', 'show', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'viewed', 'more', 'full', 'body', 'work', 'be', 'revisted', 'immersed', 'again', 'again', 'series', 'individual', 'seasons', 'going', 'be', 'example', 'whole', 'being', 'greater', 'sum', 'parts', 'Much', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'Lost', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'complete', 'viewing', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'history', 'medium', 'can', 'say', 'Viewed', 'individually', 'season', 'flaws', 'whole', 'going', 'be', 'series', 'ages.Season', '1', 'earned', 'show', 'emmy', 'best', 'dramatic', 'series', 'probably', 'most', 'popular', 'series', 'run', 'up', 'plot', 'group', 'strangers', 'survive', 'plane', 'crash', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'survive', 'tropical', 'island', 'right', 'start', 'clear', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'mere', 'rehash', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'Castaway', 'etc.', 'elements', 'works', 'are', 'certainly', 'present', 'mysterious', 'monster', 'running', 'amok', 'jungle', 'polar', 'bear', 'castaways', 'distress', 'call', 'unknown', 'French', 'woman', 'been', 'playing', 'continuously', '16', 'years', 'discovered', 'Charlie', 'Guys', 'where', 'are', '.A', 'good', 'question', 'indeed', 'first', 'season', 'slowly', 'mystery', 'episodes', 'learn', 'island', 'inhabited', 'mysterious', 'others', 'French', 'woman', 'who', 'created', 'distress', 'signal', 'located', 'mysterious', 'metal', 'hatch', 'found', 'jungle', 'series', 'cryptic', 'numbers', 'come', 'play', 'Oh', 'least', 'one', 'miracle', 'there', 'Confused', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'yet.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Lost', ""n't"", 'just', 'elaborate', 'puzzle', 'box', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'various', 'ways', 'engrossing', 'action/adventure', 'story', 'rich', 'character', 'study', 'examination', 'themes', 'destiny', 'redemption', 'head', 'scratching', 'mystery', 'show', 'also', 'rewards', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'other', 'clues', 'may', 'point', 'show', 'ultimate', 'destination', 'are', 'scattered', 'throughout.Season', '1', 'focuses', 'largely', 'fleshing', 'out', 'major', 'characters', 'Jack', 'Kate', 'Sawyer', 'Hurley', 'Locke', 'Sun', 'Jin', 'Syaid', 'etc', 'secrets', 'ultimately', 'reason', 'being', 'island', 'do', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'Flashbacks', 'fill', 'details', 'past', 'lives', 'leading', 'up', 'fateful', 'crash.Think', 'season', 'one', 'opening', 'chapter', 'introduction', 'novel', 'were', 'be', 'patient', 'show', 'just', 'island', 'not', 'going', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'good', 'ready', 'meantime', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'again']",Lost - The Complete First Season
632819,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JNOG,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 4]","It's really tough to encapsulate what LOST is all about, as the audience hasn't been let in on exactly where the series is headed, but what it reminds me of is an apple. You've got this glossy outer layer that looks appealing and you can peel it off to reveal a soft, pulpy, sweet center. But as you bite into it, you find that there's a core, tough, edged, and in it a set of seeds that will allow you to grow more apple trees ...if you plant them.The glossy outer shell is the cast and what we (the viewers) think we know about them. But as we bite into the series and get a flavor for what's on the inside, we realize that there might be a worm or two. That shiny surface hid some interesting and not-so-nice things. We've got a man who was wheelchair-bound prior to the plane crash who now can walk; a young black boy who seems to be able to make things happen just by thinking about them; a doctor who's battling the past and who is the defacto leader of the group; a beautiful young woman who seems interested in the doctor, but has a past she continues to run from; a Korean couple trying to survive the ugliness of a marriage on the fritz; an overweight lottery winner who finds out that the numbers he won the lottery with are bad luck; and a slew of others.As we eat further into this apple, we get closer to the core, that part you can't eat but contains the seeds of new life. Like the characters, if they can get passed their own cores, they might find the seeds awaiting them. Maybe.The tropical island in which they crashed on seems to be a character in the series, too. It slowly reveals hidden secrets: old plane crashes, ancient shipwrecks, concrete bunkers, a crazy French woman, polar bears, and something that protects the island itself and acts very much like a dinosaur.Sound interesting? You bet it is.Some have said LOST is a combination of Gilligan's Island meets Survivor. That's rather shallow. This series has much more depth than either of those shows. It deals with how our past influences our present and, ultimately, our futures. It makes you think about what you believe the guy standing next to you is really like. And it makes you think about the core of ourselves.I also have to comment on the fact that the producers/directors showed some guts when they killed off a prime player 3/4 of the way through the first season. Most shows would never dream of doing that in the first season.

632826,A2LEIANN1UZTHP,B00005JNOG,brainout,"[1, 1]","If you were scanning movie titles, and ran across one named 'Lost on Demon Island', you'd think it was a grade-B movie from 1950's drive-ins, where teen-age California couples sneaked off, to writhe in back seats.  Yet that's what this series is really about:  people enmeshed in a horrific experience with an island that has marked natural and supernatural 'powers' over their lives.  Before and after that experience, the island affects them, drawing them together, keeping them together;  keeping them miserable, when not on it.  Keeping them terrified yet happy, when they are on it.  As if to be happy, one must have terror, too.Yet this is no grade-B flick.  Far from it.  This series hits you where you live.  Your own life.  Very realistic about the problems of modern life, tied to the age-old problems and conundra we all face.  Epic Greek Drama, but set to our time and day.  To get the most out of it, first watch Season Six Episode 15, then go back to Season One, Episode 1.  The LOST writers kept the story's origin under wraps, until the last season.  If you find it confusing before you get to Season Six again, watch Season Six Episode 9.  Then go back to where you'd left off.  Much of the disinformation about the series in the minds of viewers, is that they don't understand 'the gods trick us to do their bidding' explanation in Series Six Episode 9.  That theme, is the heart of Greek drama.This is one of the most engrossing series of all time, and whoever at ABC decided it should have only six seasons, should have been fired.  Superb film editing, scripting, ensemble cast, story line -- everything is grade-A++++ through the end of season 4.  Season 5 is sometimes barmy, because it seems rushed, less attention to continuity (=threading subplots).  Season 6 is still good, but way too rushed.  Of course, that could be due to the show's cancellation, so they tried to finish it off.  Ending is somewhat hackneyed, therefore.Even so, you can make up your own ending.  In fact, that's what the overwhelming majority of viewers have done.  The meaning in the actual episodes and what's said in them, are very different from what viewers say.  So there is a huge amount of disinformation in lostpedia(dot)com and its sibling lost(dot)wikia(dot)com , both of which pretend to be 'encyclopedias' for LOST;  sadly, too much is hallucinated, OPINIONS, not the storyline facts.  Of the two fake 'encyclopedias', wikia is somewhat better, because at least they provide actual storyline information per character in LOST (so long as you just stick with the ABC production characters).Worse, novels post-LOST as if about LOST have been written;  all of them trite, completely off-the-mark from what the writers of LOST, actually wrote.  So you really need to see the ABC episodes for yourself.Like Bible's Revelation, the construction of the LOST storyline follows Aristotle's Poetics rules for drama, faithfully.  That's why the series is so good.  But if you don't know how Greek drama is constructed, despite the overwhelmingly obvious hints* quadrilogy (subdividing an epic drama into four sub-plays, one of which must be a comedy=happy, not haha),* NOBLE SACRIFICE as the reason for living, always by hero with tragic flaw (which he either overcomes, or does not),* katharsis (=purifying the soul's emotions through vicarious experience)* circularity (cardinal rule that drama must center on One Day),* flashbacks and flashforwards (to explain the epic value of that One Day),* idea of Time Reset due to Noble Action,* deus ex machina to save and reward (at the end of the quadrilogy),* co-existence of science and faith (big theme in Aristotle),* puny man's action being an 'agent' of the gods,* even using Greek god names and Olympian plots, Bible names and plots, quotes from The Odyssey --if you don't know all this classical drama on which all modern drama including LOST is based, then you'll hallucinate meanings which aren't in the show. And that's fine, it's only fiction.  Yet LOST fans are often religious fanatics about their hallucinated meanings.  You can't talk to them, give them storyline facts from the episodes, that contradict their positions.  It's worse than talking to someone about the Bible.So do this:  JUST WATCH the episodes, don't read anyone's commentary.  Draw your own conclusions.  It's worth your time, to do this.For if you watch the series over and over; you will always find something new or a new combination of old stuff, to ponder.  Epic question of why are we here, forces of good and evil, the mundane petty silly noble and to-die-for, all in one story.  Which is, the confluence of many stories.  Many lives.  Yours.  Mine.  Ours.Does the past determine the future, or does the future, determine the past?  What is the nature of time, of cause and effect?  Does life really go on forever?  What about your 'ripple' in the pond of time?  These are the questions, the series explores.  Pity they had to rush the last two seasons in a way to leave so many initial threads (like the one with Walt), unsewn.  More on this is in my first comment to this review (with links of posts I wrote in LostPedia, that give away the plot and purpose of the series).Enfin, you get the idea of interrelatedness, something like six degrees of separation:  at some point in our lives, one out of six people you do or will know on this planet, does or will know someone who does or will know someone who knows me.  So our lives, greatly affect each other; even if, you and I never know each other.  And above us, there is some grand scheme of things.Just watch the series.  Like everyone else who does, you'll get 'lost'; and then, maybe find yourself.",5,"Lost on Demon Island, but worth 1000 stars",1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,5695,"['were', 'scanning', 'movie',

I was drawn in by the ability of the screenwriters to continually introduce new aspects into the characters and further their development, all the meanwhile furthering the story.

632829,A1PLD593U9S5KQ,B00005JNOG,"Bruce W. Johns ""Belgragahd""","[3, 3]","Lost is a show based on survivors of a plane crash on a deserted island. The show starts directly after the crash.The first episode, and a couple episodes later, is mostly about the ""main"" characters first few hours after the crash. This season does a really good job of telling the ""main"" characters story and backgrounds. (The reason for the quotations is that there are about 12 main characters.) This is one of the reasons for the shows success. The writing is great! Even simple things you might not think about, or even see, come back to be involved in the story later.The characters go about the task of first helping those in need. Then try to make some shelter, then find some food, blah, blah, blah. The real story starts to unfold the first night. While still on the beach, the characters hear strange noises and rumblings coming from the jungle. Moments later the trees of the jungle start to shake and even louder noises and rumblings are heard/felt throughout the makeshift encampment. It's an erie experience for the characters as well as the viewer.As the story unfolds, the viewer is let in on more and more secrets of the survivors and the first few secrets of the island. It's hard to say which has more secrets, the survivors or the island. Most of the island's secrets stay shrouded in mystery untill the final couple of episodes. New secrets and mysteries are discovered to replace the old secrets and mysteries. Like I said the story is involved and complex.Lost is a drama-comedy-action-thriller. I'm not kidding, it's all those and more. Have you ever been watching a really good movie/show, and seen/heard something happen that sent chills down your spine? Do you like that type of story? If you do you will love Lost! There are about 2-3 times an episode where chills will go down your spine, not because of some axe weilding psycho, but because of an in depth well written story. If you don't like this type of story, go pick up the fifth season of Everybody Loves Raymond. You'll be safe from any type of thrills.

Ok, so I watched the first episode, and I got just impressed!The story is very good, plus the effects and the performance by the cast are both excellent. Personally, I had never head of any of those actors and actresses, but I really liked them. One thing I have to say that I liked very much, was that the story was very fast, you didn't have times to get bored, plus it has scary scenes, funny scenes, action scenes, dramatic scenes, and there are also some ""twists"", that make you think that you don't know the characters, they may not be who you think they are, and it's just incredible and entertaining. I think it's true that the producers spend the maximum money ever spent for a pilot episode on this TV show pilot; it's so good, plus, it's like a movie, lasts about 80 minutes, which is, at least for me, perfect, so the story was all established only on that first episode.Thay also had a great idea when they decided to make some flashback scenes, returning in time a little while, because it really helps you understand more about the story, the characters.

We possess an actual TV, but it is a monitor only to display exclusively what we choose to watch on DVD or tape.  Rarely have we watched any part of a TV series -- movies are our occasional fare -- until 10 days ago when a friend loaned us the first series of Lost.  We consumed the entire first season in five days -- that's more than one disc per night!  We forced ourselves to ration the episodes when we realized that there were only three discs left in the package!  Pleased to be watching such quality storytelling without abominable commercial interruptions, we have been mesmerized by the suspense, plot twists, backstory drama, excellent acting and writing, beauty of the location shots, apropos music, and promise of a deeper storyline to follow in future episodes.  Disc seven, which contains three hours of extras, is overall very entertaining.  The screentests of the lead actors are somewhat ho hum, but the featurettes about specific episodes and background on the creation of the series are informative and entertaining.  The only downside to an utterly fascinating set of DVDs is the somewhat boring commentary supplied on four (I believe) of the episodes.  Desperate for more Lost, I watched these few episodes for a second time, listening to the commentary, but found myself nodding off due to the mundane content and rather monotone delivery.The only other American TV series (we frequently purchase and watch BBC-productions) we have watched in recent years has been the Everwood Series I DVD, a completely different genre of television that is in a class by itself when it comes to quality of writing and raw beauty of its acting.  Lost is definitely a ""keeper"" and I look forward to purchasing Series 2 when it becomes available.

632841,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B00005JNOG,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[8, 14]","Over the past three years ""Lost"" has gone from winning best TV drama at the Emmys (for this season) to simply being known for sliding ratings and their outspoken, whiny fans. Of course ABC and the makers of this show have brought a lot of that on themselves with storylines that provide far more questions than answers and a scheduling system that would have killed most weaker shows. Though after we work our way through all that nonsense we find a show that is fine but ultimately overrated. Maybe people love this show as though it was the perfect specimen that they wish it was.  After busting down the gates with two strong episodes to open the series which lay out for us strong characters and strong groundwork the show loses its new show luster very quickly. I'm sure JJ Abrams and company would have you believe that this show is far more cinematic than episodic but I'm not so easily convinced. Too many episodes fall into the trap of being mysteries that need to be solved in 43 minutes. Who burned down the raft? Who poisoned Michael? What is this, freakin' ""Murder She Wrote""?The story, for those that don't know, involves a bunch of people who get on a plane which goes down in the middle of nowhere, stranding them on an island that is apparently on nobodies map. Then weird stuff starts to happen. A polar bear shows up. They find some crazy French chick with a taste for torture. Jack (Matthew Fox, strong in this role) takes over as natural leader of the pack. They try to play it up as though he needs to be a leader to get over his daddy issues but I wasn't really buying that. More realistically the good suits at ABC probably picked him out to be the leader because they wanted a clean cut, attractive white male to get top billing. There are a lot of characters here and by painting them fairly broadly (the Iraqi, the hot girl, the fat guy) they are able to produce legitimately strong people. We learn about them slowly over the season through flashbacks to their previous lives. These flashbacks were widely criticized as simply slowing down the plot, but let's look at this situation from a different angle. This is a huge season (large even by network TV drama standards) at 1068 minutes, could they really fill all that out, and 5 seasons afterwards, with just island life? Especially considering how tame this island life is (no raping!). The story moves towards two climaxes. One involves a set of characters who build a raft and set sail for freedom into the wild blue yonder. The other revolves around a mysterious hatch found buried deep in the jungle and what exactly it contains.Along the way the plots vary in quality. Claire getting kidnapped provides a perfect mini arch right in the middle of the season. I also enjoyed most anything Sawyer was involved in because even though I generally hate Texas racists he was at least pragmatic compared to the rest of the day dreamers.

632846,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JNOG,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 3]","Funny how the opening credits perfectly sums up the feeling of the show. The word ""Lost"" appears among a black background out of focus coming closer to camera, then it goes clear for 2 seconds than goes blurry again before disappearing. Exactly like the show: plot points and answers are revealed only to have them not appear like they are and it's gone. Like trying to finding a really fast cat.A man wakes up in the jungle disoriented. While going through the jungle and reaching the coastline he sees a certainly eye-opening sight: the flight he was on as crashed and debris among with survivors are on the beach. This has to be the best scene in the entire series, it's suspensful and gripping, especially the um, turbine part. Then the pilot continues with the series next 2 best scenes: the hearing of something ominous in the jungle and an ""attack"" on the front end of the plane.After that, things don't really get as gripping, except for a little phantom passenger but other than that, nothing really sinks its claws in like those opening 2 pilot episodes(including the transmission scene, btw recommendation: don't read the booklet with the episode sypnosis, they're not the most discreet about certain things.) What does compel you though is the answers to those questions which oddly just literally hang for episodes on end.With such a huge survivor list you would think we'd lose perspective on how many people they are but you notice that there's just enough although 48 survivors is kind of pushing it. We'd all develop our favorites too, and that might change since every episode one character tends to have their own flashback episode where something about their life is revealed. So some survivors you probably wouldn't like but end up liking them anyway. One of my favorites is Sawyer: funny, brash and quite complicated. And I can identify with Charlie, always wants to help but never seems to have it appreciated, even when he needs the help as well.If they're could be one complaint is that the show almost seems like buckling under its own weight. Like loading a table with boxes, the more you put on the more it'll crack and break. So it seems with the show: with so many questions and very few answers being given, you're not really sure how the writers will pull off the ending without it being like ""oh come on, as if!""The packaging is odd too. 2 discs come stacked with one on the other rather than separate parts.

These commentaries and featurettes explain a lot about the mechanics of the show without giving away any of the mysteries.On the first DVD, there are audio commentaries for both parts of the ""Pilot"" episode by executive producers J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof and Bryan Burk. They talk briefly about how they pitched the show and take us through the making of the episode. In an interesting moment, Abrams actually stops the episode to show us how they did an explosion in the crash site sequence. These are very informative tracks with lots of anecdotes about filming.There is an audio commentary on ""Walkabout"" by executive producers Jack Bender and David Fury and actor Terry O'Quinn. Bender talks about the challenge of working with trained wild boars that ate too much and didn't feel like moving in a scene that required them to charge the actors. Unfortunately, O'Quinn doesn't talk much only offering brief insights.The second DVD includes a commentary for ""The Moth"" by Lindelof, Burk and actor Dominic Monaghan. The Lord of the Rings alum tends to spend most of the time cracking jokes and offering little insight on this so-so track.The fourth DVD features an audio commentary on ""Hearts and Minds"" by executive producer Carlton Cuse, supervising producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach and actors Maggie Grace and Ian Sommerhalder. The two producers dominate the track as they talk about their intentions with the actors offering their occasional two cents.The bulk of the extras can be found on the seventh DVD. ""The Genesis of Lost"" is a good look at how the show's story came together. The network had a script but it was awful. At the time, Abrams was the network's go-to guy and he had already been toying with an idea of a plane crashing on a deserted island.""Designing a Disaster"" takes a look at how they put together the chaotic crash site in the ""Pilot"" episode. The creators had no script and very little time but the production crew was able to find the right plane, take it apart, ship it and put it back together (sort of).""Before They Were Lost"" examines how the cast came together in only three weeks. The actors talk about how they got the gig with footage from their audition tapes.""Welcome to Oahu: The Making of The Pilot"" takes us through the first day of filming to completion. Cast and crew recount the sometimes harsh weather conditions they had to shoot in but it did help them bond as a team.""The Art of Matthew Fox"" is a collection of photographs the actor took while shooting the ""Pilot."" He talks about them as they flash on the screen in this nice extra.""Lost@Comicon"" is a brief clip of some of the cast and crew at that year's San Diego Comicon and their impressions of the event.""Lost: On Location"" is a collection of behind-the-scenes featurettes that give insight into how certain sequences in select episodes were achieved, like the least-threatening wild boars, the humanizing of Sawyer, the revelation of Kate as a fugitive bank robber and a look at the climatic season finale.""Onset with Jimmy Kimmel"" features the late night talk show host visiting the cast on location in Hawaii in this whimsical extra. Kimmel asks Monaghan to compose a (lame) theme song for the show and goofs around with everyone.""Backstage with Driveshaft"" takes a look at Charlie and his fictitious band, which thinks of themselves as the next Oasis but is probably only a one-hit wonder.There are two flashbacks from the season finale with Claire and Sayid.Also included are 13 deleted scenes that feature mostly minor exchanges between characters, like a nice bit where Charlie bums a cigarette off of Sawyer, that are interesting but not essential and were probably cut because of time.""Bloopers from the Set"" is an amusing montage of blown lines and funny pratfalls on this very physically demanding show.Finally, there is a Q&A; session ""Live from the Museum of Television and Radio."" The select cast and crew joke with each other in this entertaining if not frivolous extra.

There's the eight-minute long Art of Matthew Fox, in which the actor does voice over of photos he took of the cast, crew, locations, from season one.

Still, don't let that discourage you from buying this if owning a complete copy of Lost Season 1 is all you wanted.If you have already faithfully watched every single episode on TV however, and don't feel an urge to watch your favorites a second time, the seemingly long list of bonus features in reality aren't worth enough to make it a must-have for the dedicated Lost fan.The 24 episodes come on 6 DVDs, four episodes on each disc, totaling an approximate 1069 minutes of Lost goodness. A seventh disc is dedicated in whole to the extras, which, while it would be a sizable amount of additional material for any 2-hour movie, feels very limited next to the 24 episodes here. There's a disproportionate attention on the grandiose season opener, the famous Pilot episode which cost ABC $12 million, making it the most expensive and certainly the most impressive TV show debut of all time. As such, the extra attention is understandable but you still can't help but feel unsatisfied with the rest. For example, there's a grand total of FOUR minutes of bloopers -- for the whole season. Adding to the insult, they are even crudely censored of profanities, making it hard to have a good laugh with the constant beeping.As for the show itself, Lost indeed is a great find, as is proudly quoted from the New York Daily News on the box. Sure, there are things which bother me or episodes that I find boring, but as long as I always look forward to watching the forthcoming episodes this much, you know it's something special. The most I dread about Lost is what I've come to call the Matrix Syndrome, after the trilogy of movies. A promising beginning, with lots of mystery, tons of unanswered questions; followed by a middle act where you feel like it's only trying to postpone getting to the answers; then finally, a disastrous ending, as evidently, there could be no satisfying answers and there never were.In a Jimmy Kimmel segment, included on the seventh disc, Matthew Fox (who plays Jack on the show) claims that ""I guarantee that somebody knows where it's headed."" It is strange then that I still get the feeling that the show's writers are only digging themselves deeper and deeper into a hole of unexplainable events, hoping in vain that one day in the future they might figure out a satisfying solution.",5,Solid but lacking DVD set of an extraordinary show,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,2595,"['Quality-wise', 'technological', 'side', 'Lost', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'set', 'delivers', 'Video', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'as', 'good', ""'d"", 'expect', 'DVD', '2005', 'drawback', 'transitionary', 'times', 'live', 'now', 'video', 'quality', 'HDTV', 'broadcasts', 'were', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'superior', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'discourage', 'buying', 'owning', 'complete', 'copy', 'Lost', 'Season', '1', 'wanted.If', 'have', 'already', 'faithfully', 'watched', 'single', 'episode', 'TV', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'urge', 'watch', 'favorites', 'second', 'time', 'seemingly', 'long', 'list', 'bonus', 'features', 'reality', 'are', ""n't"", 'worth', 'enough', 'make', 'must-have', 'dedicated', 'Lost', 'fan.The', '24', 'episodes', 'come', '6', 'DVDs', 'four', 'episodes', 'disc', 'totaling', 'approximate', '1069', 'minutes', 'Lost', 'goodness', 'seventh', 'disc', 'dedicated', 'whole', 'extras', 'would', 'be', 'sizable', 'amount', 'additional', 'material', '2-hour', 'movie', 'feels', 'very', 'limited', 'next', '24', 'episodes', 'here', 'disproportionate', 'attention', 'grandiose', 'season', 'opener', 'famous', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'cost', 'ABC', '12', 'million', 'making', 'most', 'expensive', 'certainly', 'most', 'impressive', 'TV', 'show', 'debut', 'time', 'such', 'extra', 'attention', 'understandable', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'unsatisfied', 'rest', 'example', 'grand', 'total', 'FOUR', 'minutes', 'bloopers', 'whole', 'season', 'Adding', 'insult', 'are', 'even', 'crudely', 'censored', 'profanities', 'making', 'hard', 'have', 'good', 'laugh', 'constant', 'beeping.As', 'show', 'Lost', 'indeed', 'great', 'find', 'proudly', 'quoted', 'New', 'York', 'Daily', 'News', 'box', 'Sure', 'are', 'things', 'bother', 'find', 'boring', 'as', 'long', 'always', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'forthcoming', 'much', 'know', 'something', 'special', 'most', 'dread', 'Lost', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'call', 'Matrix', 'Syndrome', 'trilogy', 'movies', 'promising', 'beginning', 'lots', 'mystery', 'tons', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'followed', 'middle', 'act', 'where', 'feel', 'only', 'trying', 'postpone', 'getting', 'answers', 'then', 'finally', 'disastrous', 'ending', 'evidently', 'could', 'be', 'satisfying', 'answers', 'never', 'were.In', 'Jimmy', 'Kimmel', 'segment', 'included', 'seventh', 'disc', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'who', 'Jack', 'show', 'guarantee', 'somebody', 'where', 'headed', 'strange', 'then', 'still', 'get', 'feeling', 'show', 'writers', 'are', 'only', 'digging', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'hole', 'unexplainable', 'events', 'hoping', 'vain', 'one', 'day', 'future', 'might', 'figure', 'out', 'satisfying', 'solution']",Lost - The Complete First Season

632853,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00005JNOG,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[6, 6]","""Lost"" became an instant hit, and the series has since rewarded its faithful audience with engaging plotlines, intriguing and realistic characters, and convoluted twists which spark endless speculation. The show focuses on 14 of the original 48 survivors, with the rest of the group being made up of extras and a few recurring characters. The format of each episode focuses on the past of one of the 14 characters (in a ""flashback"" form), whilst simultaneously depicting events in the ""present"" time of the island. But of course, the island is no mere setting. The island is the omnipresent 15th character, delivering surprises and danger for the survivors at every turn. By all means, it appears to be a rather sizeable South Pacific tropical paradise, but as the survivors quickly find out, this island is far from normal. Though it feeds its inhabitants, sometimes heals or aids those in need, and keepsits stranded victims mysteriously well-groomed and ruggedly handsome at all times, it also contains terrifying danger and befuddling mysteries. I'd be willing to bet that most other South Pacific islands don't have polar bears, anachronistic artifacts, or large obscure beasts that sound like robotic dinosaurs roaming the inland forests and feeding on the deepest fears of their victims. But when the hope of rescue vanishes quickly, the survivors must learn how to sustain themselves within this supernatural atmosphere.Social roles and reputations are established among the core fourteen, and several character staples are present, though somehow given a more believable, less-caricatured spin. The pseudo-leader feigning bravery to compensate for his own inner demons, the amicable one with a criminal past, the seemingly uncaring jerk with a tragic history, the kid with strange powers and his stubborn father, the washed-up musician, or the wise intuitive elder who somehow understands the behavior of the island and goes with the flow of its will. Just a few examples, although Abrams and his creative team are, by and large, successful in making these character templates not seem derivative. Their personable behavior only makes you more curious to witness their outcome on this lost, and increasingly otherworldly, island.Originally, the concept for this series was formed and hammered out in just a scant few months before its premiere. Its production was incredibly fast; for example, only 3 weeks were allowed to cast nearly 2 dozen people for primary, long term, and recurring roles. By the time the series premiered, the season had only a slim order of 13 episodes for its first season. After the first four episodes garnered enormously high ratings, however, approval was given out to produce another 9 episodes, making 22 total. Filmed during the airing of the other 13, ""Lost"" was given a very padded out schedule in order to make up for the wait time of the latter 9; the show even went on hiatus for nearly a month in December of 2004. Despite its slightly clumsy beginnings, however, the show continued to pull in high ratings from enraptured audiences and received much critical acclaim for its high-quality storytelling, culminating with both Golden Globe and Emmy awards for Best Drama Series, in addition to several other accolades, nominations, and wins.Constantly challenging, always engaging, ""Lost"" is an addictive puzzle of a series, and richly rewards the astute adult audience it's aimed at. Though its high ratings and continual popularity could possibly subject it to overexposure, scheduling abuse, or creative burnout on the part of the writers (wherein they ask more questions than they can satisfactorily answer), the potential for this series is still incredible, and I for one am hoping for many more labyrinthine years to come!",5,"WOW, the best series since 24",1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,3774,"['Lost', 'became', 'instant', 'hit', 'series', 'rewarded', 'faithful', 'audience', 'engaging', 'plotlines', 'intriguing', 'realistic', 'characters', 'convoluted', 'twists', 'spark', 'endless', 'speculation', 'show', '14', 'original', '48', 'survivors', 'rest', 'group', 'being', 'made', 'extras', 'few', 'recurring', 'characters', 'format', 'episode', 'past', 'one', '14', 'characters', 'flashback', 'form', 'simultaneously', 'depicting', 'events', 'present', 'time', 'island', 'course', 'island', 'mere', 'setting', 'island', 'omnipresent', '15th', 'character', 'delivering', 'surprises', 'danger', 'survivors', 'turn', 'means', 'be', 'rather', 'sizeable', 'South', 'Pacific', 'tropical', 'paradise', 'survivors', 'quickly', 'find', 'out', 'island', 'far', 'normal', 'inhabitants', 'sometimes', 'heals', 'aids', 'need', 'keepsits', 'stranded', 'victims', 'mysteriously', 'well-groomed', 'ruggedly', 'handsome', 'times', 'also', 'terrifying', 'danger', 'befuddling', 'mysteries', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'bet', 'most', 'other', 'South', 'Pacific', 'islands', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'polar', 'bears', 'anachronistic', 'artifacts', 'large', 'obscure', 'beasts', 'sound', 'robotic', 'dinosaurs', 'roaming', 'inland', 'forests', 'feeding', 'deepest', 'fears', 'victims', 'when', 'hope', 'rescue', 'vanishes', 'quickly', 'survivors', 'must', 'learn', 'how', 'sustain', 'supernatural', 'atmosphere.Social', 'roles', 'reputations', 'are', 'established', 'core', 'fourteen', 'several', 'character', 'staples', 'are', 'present', 'somehow', 'given', 'more', 'believable', 'less-caricatured', 'spin', 'pseudo-leader', 'feigning', 'bravery', 'compensate', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'amicable', 'one', 'criminal', 'past', 'seemingly', 'uncaring', 'jerk', 'tragic', 'history', 'kid', 'strange', 'powers', 'stubborn', 'father', 'washed-up', 'musician', 'wise', 'intuitive', 'elder', 'who', 'somehow', 'behavior', 'island', 'flow', 'will', 'Just', 'few', 'examples', 'Abrams', 'creative', 'team', 'are', 'large', 'successful', 'making', 'character', 'not', 'seem', 'derivative', 'personable', 'behavior', 'only', 'more', 'curious', 'witness', 'outcome', 'lost', 'increasingly', 'otherworldly', 'island.Originally', 'concept', 'series', 'was', 'formed', 'hammered', 'out', 'just', 'scant', 'few', 'months', 'premiere', 'production', 'was', 'incredibly', 'fast', 'example', 'only', '3', 'weeks', 'were', 'allowed', 'cast', 'nearly', '2', 'dozen', 'people', 'primary', 'long', 'term', 'recurring', 'roles', 'time', 'series', 'premiered', 'season', 'had', 'only', 'slim', 'order', '13', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'garnered', 'enormously', 'high', 'ratings', 'however', 'approval', 'was', 'given', 'out', 'produce', '9', 'episodes', 'making', '22', 'total', 'Filmed', 'airing', 'other', '13', 'Lost', 'was', 'given', 'very', 'padded', 'out', 'schedule', 'order', 'make', 'up', 'wait', 'time', 'latter', '9', 'show', 'even', 'went', 'hiatus', 'nearly', 'month', 'December', '2004', 'slightly', 'clumsy', 'beginnings', 'however', 'show', 'continued', 'pull', 'high', 'ratings', 'enraptured', 'audiences', 'received', 'much', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'high-quality', 'storytelling', 'culminating', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Emmy', 'awards', 'Best', 'Drama', 'Series', 'addition', 'several', 'other', 'accolades', 'nominations', 'wins.Constantly', 'challenging', 'always', 'engaging', 'Lost', 'addictive', 'puzzle', 'series', 'richly', 'rewards', 'astute', 'adult', 'audience', 'aimed', 'high', 'ratings', 'continual', 'popularity', 'could', 'possibly', 'subject', 'overexposure', 'scheduling', 'abuse', 'creative', 'burnout', 'part', 'writers', 'ask', 'more', 'questions', 'can', 'satisfactorily', 'answer', 'potential', 'series', 'still', 'incredible', 'one', 'am', 'hoping', 'many', 'more', 'labyrinthine', 'years', 'come']",Lost - The Complete First Season

Amith (kndy),"[48, 48]","""LOST"" the series that took America by storm in 2004 and has since been a fan favorite today.In 2004, the series was hyped as the latest series from J.J. Abrams who was known for his TV series ""Felicity"" and ""Alias""  and joined by a talented team which includes executive producer and writer Damon Lindelof (""Crossing Jordan""), executive producer and writer Carlton Cuse (""Nash Bridges"", ""The Adventures of Brisco County Jr."") , writer Jeffrey Lieber, producer Ra'uf Glasgow (""The Big Easy"" and ""Profiler""), Jack Bender (""Eight is Enough"" and ""Beverly Hills 90210'), Bryan Burke (""Alias"") and Jean Higgins (""CSI: Miami"") .The series debuted on ABC in Sept. 2004 and was instantly a critically acclaimed hit as people all over the Internet would discuss and debate the circumstances of the show.  Series creators would plant Easter Eggs on the TV series, on the Internet, on commercial trailers and eventually people were drawn in by the well-written dramatic thriller and sci-fi storyline, wonderful acting but the overall signs of conspiracy and mystery.  The series would inspire many blogs, podcasts and so much hype that around 17-20 million people were drawn to the series each night a new episode aired.The series won an Emmy Award for ""Outstanding Drama Series"" and series creator J.J. Abrams was award an Emmy in September 2005.  The series also won the Writers Guild of America Awards for ""Outstanding Achievement in Writing for a Dramatic Television Series"", 2005 Producer Guild Awards for ""Best Production"" and the 2005 Director's Guild Award for ""Best Direction of a Dramatic Television Program"" and the ""Screen Actors Guild Awards 2005' for Best Ensemble Cast.For the first season, a total of 25 episodes aired from Sept. 2004 through May 2005.

""SeasonPlay"" is optional and people can select it before watching an episode.VIDEO & AUDIO:""LOST""  is a series that looks incredible on High Definition.  Featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1), the detail of the island is captured quite vibrantly.  The green lush plants that surround the island, the blue skies, the blue ocean.  Personally, most of the video footage shot in Hawaii tend to be vibrant in colors and ""LOST"" is no exception.  There is grain that can be seen in each episode and I have to admit that the quality is not up to par as ""LOST - THE COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON"" (not sure if they are using better equipment in the later seasons) but the picture quality is still pretty good.There is little compression artifacts that can be seen in low light conditions but overall, the picture quality of ""LOST"" is not perfect but still looks gorgeous!  I compared both my DVD box set to this Blu-ray set and the picture quality in High Definition shows off detail that I never caught on DVD.  From the plane wreckage to the orange dimples on the orange peel in John Locke's mouth.  These can be seen quite clearly on Blu-ray.As for the audio, ""LOST"" is featured in DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  The dialogue is quite clear but one thing that caught my attention is how magnificent the audio is in terms of capturing the ambiance of the island when each person is moving through the jungle.  The explosions of the plane is caught all around you and you are literally immersed into the destruction of the plane as audio is heard on the front channels, surrounds, rear surrounds and through the LFE of your subwoofer.  Very nice!Also, I loved how music and sounds really brought an overall mood to certain scenes. The music by Michael Giacchino and the way the orchestra creates that tension for the scenes was awesome.  So, music plays a big part in the series and the music soundtrack is just wonderful!SPECIAL FEATURES:The Blu-ray edition of ""LOST - THE COMPLETE SEASON ONE"" is featured in Standard Definition (480i) and English 5.1 Dolby Digital with English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.

I was on the main forums every week, downloaded every ""LOST"" podcast available, read the magazines and just pretty much got drawn in by the story but the various theories that people had about the island, the characters and more. In fact, I have owned the first season on DVD, listened to the audio books and even owned the pilot on UMD.  That's how hooked I was to this show.Personally, I just found that mystique of crash landing in an island and having to survive to be quite exciting but even moreso, finding out that there are some weird things going on in the island that makes you wonder if what we were watching is actually happening or are the people actually dead.  There were so many unusual things that have happened and ""LOST"" was what was needed on network TV.Also, as much as ""LOST"" would seem like a wreck with so many characters featured, the way the show is presented through various flashbacks of each of the main characters, the writers really focused on character development and making the viewer feel positive (or negative) about a certain character and learn about their behavior and a past that somehow each character has some kind of connection with each other.There were so many amazing episodes, one such episode that will always be a favorite was the first death of one of the main 14.  What a shocker! What was equally amazing was watching the season finale and I can remember being shocked and having to go back and forth on my DVR and then later on my DVD copies to see these ""secrets"" that fans have caught in the final episode.  Nevertheless, that finale was awesome and left myself and many fans highly anticipating the second season.The first season of course leaves the viewer with plenty of questions (and we're currently awaiting season 6 and many questions still exist today) but it was those questions that help fuel the fire to various theories that many fans could not help but take part of.  It was quite fun to see how this series captured the attention of so many people and how the producers, writers and even the talent were so surprised of the various theories themselves.I have to say that watching the first season of ""LOST"" on High Definition five years later is quite amazing.  The series is absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray and  was also impressed by the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack.  And it was great to see all the special features on the DVD included (although I wonder if all Easter Eggs are also included on the Blu-ray since I've only found a very few so far).Fans who enjoy the ""LOST"" series will truly want to own the series on High Definition.  If you are a big fan of the show, it is pretty much a no-brainer to pick up both Season 1 and 2 (as well as the previously released Season 3 and 4) on Blu-ray.  This season is what started it all and with the final sixth season coming soon, you can't help but be happy that all four seasons are now available on Blu-ray.""LOST - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" on Blu-ray is highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray: Absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray, awesome sound quality and another season of ""LOST"", so worth owning on Blu-ray!",1245110400,"06 16,

There is excellent television shows(Battlestar Galactica Re-Mastered) and  perfect television(Buffy The Vampire Slayer).  Lost crushes every television show in history.  The acting cannot be beat, the writing is swift and memorable, and the story is the stuff of legends.Lost Season 1 is in my opinion the best season of the 4 and a half seasons so far.  Not to say that the subsequent seasons are bad(they still trump everything else!), but they lack something that this season has.  The acting was the best, the writing was close to the best, and the story was not as strong as later seasons.The story is this:  Ocenaic Flight 815 has crashed landed on an Island in the Pacific Ocean.  48 people have survived on a plane that had 324 passengers.  The next day, three chracters, Jack, a doctor with serious daddy issues, Kate, a fugitive who was being transported to prision, and Charlie, a drug addict who was in a rock band, trek into the jungle to try to find the pilot.  They find him, and then something kills him.  This is how it all started.The acting award goes to Terry O'Quinn for his performance as John Locke.  Not many actors can compare to Mr. O'Quinn's tallent in Season 1.  Although their are severel runner ups, including Naveen Andrews as Sayid Jarrah, Josh Holloway as Sawyer, and Ian Somerhalder as Boone Carlyle.Top 5 episodes:1. Deus Ex Machina2. Walkabout3.

Anyway, with TV a wasteland of reality programming and predictable drama's like CSI and Law & Order, Lost shines above the silly quips of William Peterson. I just wish ABC (and other networks) would take more risks. Given a bit of creative freedom and less network suits saying shows have to appeal to the straight, white teenage boy demographic, TV can be so much better. Sure, there is room for dumb shows like CSI and Law & Order, but do we need so many? I don't think so. Anyway, Lost reminds me of why TV can be good and not just an idiot box. The characters are flawed, and no one is a hero, even Jack (who I still think hates being the defacto leader). And despite the death of Boone (played by the guy with bedroom eyes and perfect cheekbones, Ian Somerhalder and was really a mistake) the show has yet to stumble.

632873,A3W0S9MR4A959D,B00005JNOG,dramadude 186,"[1, 1]","I somehow missed LOST during its first season.  But after renting the first disc and watching all four episodes of it in one sitting (including the absolutely stunning two hour pilot), I have been hooked.  LOST is now the only show I watch as it airs, rather than waiting for the DVDs or watching it on Tivo.The premise of the show is simple; a plane crashes on a tropical island, and the show follows the survivors.  Yet LOST is so much more than that simple setup.  By the end of the pilot episode, it's clear that the surivivors of Oceanic Flight 815 didn't land on any normal island.  There's something lurking in the trees, a mysterious broadcast that's been running for 16 years, and oh yeah, someone found a polar bear in the rainforest.  As the season progresses, people start having visions of the dead, people are mysteriously kidnapped, and a babbling French woman warns of ""Others"" on the island who are anything but friendly.If all of that sounds ridiculous or confusing, don't worry.  The show is so well written and executed that you buy into everything.  You won't get all the answers right away, and many questions will be left unanswered when the season ends.  But the fun of LOST is coming up with your own theories about the island and the survivors, and the careful viewer will find a wealth of clues hidden in the narrative to help you along (which makes rewatching the episodes just as interesting, as you catch all sorts of things you initially missed).  But while the ever growing mysteries of the narrative keep you engrossed, the real bread and butter of LOST is the absolutely stunning ensemble cast.Of the 48 people who survived the crash, the series focuses on 14 of them, and that the writers manage to juggle so many characters is a feat unto itself.  Each person has a backstory, which is revealed piece by piece through the flashbacks in every episode.  These flashbacks show what happened to people before they came to the island, and also help explain why people act the way they do in the present.  Each character is brought to excellent life by the supremely talented actors who play them, and each role is tailored to the performers strengths.Even better, the writers and actors (with rare exception) avoid showing the characters in black and white, good and bad terms.  Pretty much everyone will do something you love, and then a few episodes later something you hate.  With so many characters in the show, one of the great joys is discussing it with fellow viewers and seeing which characters you like and don't (you probably won't agree).  I personally love Sun and Jin (a Korean couple who doesn't speak a lick of English, and is more fascinating because of it), Southern bad boy Sawyer, and ex-rocker/druggie Charlie, all of whom light up the screen when they're around and have suitably intriguing backstories.I could go on and on about this show's production values, but suffice to say the show looks like nothing else on television.  It is shot entirely on location in Hawaii, and the tropical vistas are absolutely stunning, especially with the widescreen DVD transfer.  There's also some solid special effects work, aided by the fact that it is not overused.The DVD set has a wealth of extras, including commentaries on select episodes that will provide further hints as to what the writers have in store.  However, I recommend saving these until you finish the entire set to avoid any spoilers.If you are even remotely interested in this set, you MUST buy it.  You will not be disappointed.  It is simply the most amazing debut season of any show I have ever seen.  Even the best shows spend a good portion of their first year figuring out what they want to be; LOST knows what it is from the first frame, and doesn't veer from that until the season finale fades to black.  But while watching LOST, do yourself two favors:1) Carve out large chunks of time to watch it in, because nearly every episode ends in a cliffhanger that will leave you wanting to watch ""just one more.""2) Watch it with friends, because half the fun is comparing theories about just what is going on with the island (for instance, what do *you* think is hiding in the trees?) and arguing about who is up to no good.",5,My Favorite TV Show.

It also appears that it had survived until this year terminated its run.Seeing this first season now, I can recognize that it had promise even that first year: the creative staff knew how to create evening soap opera and the director and cast had the talent, overall, to put their ideas into convincing performances. That is not to say that anyone was challenging Sir Lawrence Olivier's pre-eminence as master of the English speaking stage, but mostly the strength was where it was needed. I have no ideas what troubles were devised in the remaining years, but these refugees from civilization stranded on an island, sure had plenty of nicely suspenseful ones. Seeing the season without commercial breaks, without delay of a week between episodes, puts a production to a very tough test it was not devised to surmount. The breaks are built into the structure of each program. However, the production bore up well. Obviously, there is a family resemblance inevitably built in to make the show somewhat like other good (and bad) stranded on an island stories, but rarely does the material seem stale.I can commend the show to any television viewer who likes to immerse him-or her-self in the challenges to life that that a threatened community must face.",4,Nobody Knew the Troubles They Were to See,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,1429,"['write', '2010', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'series', 'was', 'recently', 'suggested', 'something', 'worth', 'seeing', 'by-now', 'long', 'hiatus', 'television', 'watching', 'also', 'had', 'survived', 'year', 'terminated', 'run.Seeing', 'first', 'season', 'now', 'can', 'recognize', 'had', 'promise', 'even', 'first', 'year', 'creative', 'staff', 'knew', 'how', 'create', 'evening', 'soap', 'opera', 'director', 'cast', 'had', 'talent', 'overall', 'put', 'ideas', 'convincing', 'performances', 'not', 'say', 'anyone', 'was', 'challenging', 'Sir', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'pre-eminence', 'master', 'English', 'speaking', 'stage', 'mostly', 'strength', 'was', 'where', 'was', 'needed', 'have', 'ideas', 'what', 'troubles', 'were', 'devised', 'remaining', 'years', 'refugees', 'civilization', 'stranded', 'island', 'sure', 'had', 'plenty', 'nicely', 'suspenseful', 'ones', 'Seeing', 'season', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'delay', 'week', 'episodes', 'production', 'very', 'tough', 'test', 'was', 'not', 'devised', 'surmount', 'breaks', 'are', 'built', 'structure', 'program', 'However', 'production', 'bore', 'up', 'well', 'Obviously', 'family', 'resemblance', 'inevitably', 'built', 'make', 'show', 'somewhat', 'other', 'good', 'bad', 'stranded', 'island', 'stories', 'rarely', 'material', 'seem', 'stale.I', 'can', 'commend', 'show', 'television', 'viewer', 'who', 'immerse', 'him-or', 'her-self', 'challenges', 'life', 'threatened', 'community', 'must', 'face']",Lost - The Complete First Season

""Gilligan's Island"" all over again? Not quite. This mysterious show rapidly turned itself into a runaway hit. Mystery, drama, the supernatural and horror seep into this series, turning it into one of the most intriguing shows on television.The series opens with a wrecked plane on a beach, surrounded by panicking people who manage to escape the wreckage. Jack (Matthew Fox) manages to group the refugees into a makeshift camp on the shore -- but soon they hear strange noises and see palm trees being trampled by a gargantuan monster. And when he ventures into the jungle, with the mysterious Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and junkie rocker Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), they find the still-living pilot. The pilot reveals that they are hundreds of miles off course, and no one will be able to find him. Then he gets eaten by an unseen monster.Now the island is occupied by a motley band, including a strange warrior-sage with a knife-throwing knack, a traumatized con man, a pregnant girl whose baby holds a secret, a secretive Korean couple, a snobby rich girl and her exasperated brother, an Iraqi ex-soldier, and a ""dude""-talking chubby guy who has a dark secret of his own. Despite Jack's best efforts, the group splits into two camps, and tensions grow between them.And there are even worse things coming -- the survivors are not the only ones on the island. A possibly crazy Frenchwoman (Mira Furlan) is hiding somewhere in the jungle, and the murderous ""Ethan"" kidnaps and nearly kills two of the survivors. The island itself has mysteries -- mysterious monsters, voices in the woods, radio towers, a metal hatch in the jungle ground, and a string of numbers that bring madness and ill fortune...Yes, it's a weird show. But in the midst of shallow sitcoms and endless reality TV, it's refreshing to see a twisty-turny show like this one. J.J. Adams, best known for ""Alias,"" outdoes his first hit TV show with something totally different. The best way to describe it is as ""Swiss Family Robinson,"" as written by Stephen King.The gorgeous Hawaiian landscape is a contrast for such a dark storyline. Adams never reveals everything, which keeps up the suspense -- the mysterious monster (a dinosaur?) is only briefly seen by the characters, and nobody knows exactly what it is. Nor are we sure who has been there, or what is up with the island. Adams keeps viewers guessing by slowly peeling away the layers.What's really interesting is that ""Lost"" is truly an ensemble show -- Adams gives every character a chance to shine, and flashbacks reveal what makes them tick. Some, like ex-con Kate, are a bit more mysterious than others, but some like the Korean marrieds and the haunted, smart-alecky Sawyer get a lot more dimension and humanity.Matthew Fox is given a lot of attention, and he is a good actor. But it's the secondary actors that really catch your attention: Dominic Monaghan gives a simply amazing performance as Charlie, especially when Charlie goes through withdrawal, Jorge Garcia is equally good at comedy (""Dude, that was a Jedi moment!"") and drama, and Terry O'Quinn is stellar as the enigmatic cubicle-worker-turned-jungle-warrior. Evangeline Lilly gives the debut performance of a lifetime, as tormented criminal Kate.The blu-ray edition amps up the visual effects, especially in the jungle and with special effects. And the blu-ray basically has the same ol' extras -- episode commentary, behind-the-scenes footage, making-of stuff, bloopers, deleted scenes, extra flashbacks, and so on and so forth.""Lost"" is a well-written, well-acted show that brings a bit of mystery back into prime-time television.

632885,AL639TTVGWE9M,B00005JNOG,"Enrique Fernandez Roberts ""Stray Dog and comm...","[5, 6]","I am a huge fan of Lost, but have discovered that owning the dvd set can spoil the viewer.First, as a quick overview of the series, this is basically a David Lynch inspired, X-Files-esque show about a band of 40 plane crash survivors who are all forced to live together on a deserted island.The mystery begins almost immediately, as some passengers have hidden agendas, pasts that they can not make public to the rest of the band, and the occasional personal mystery.Every episode focuses on a different character, but also moves the story forward.  The acting is spectacular, and there are several breakout stars from this show.  The fellows who play Locke, Hurley and Michael are particularly adept character actors who fit into this bunch like small hands in a velvet glove.I actually prefer to watch this tv show on the dvd format than on regular tv.  Why is that?  Because my one complaint about Lost is that they do everything absolutely possible to make it suspenseful.  Thus, at every tense moment, the camera pulls away , cuts to another scene, ends the episode or cuts to commercial.  With the dvd set you don't have to wait two minutes for the ads to end nor do you have to wait a week to get resolution on a tense situation the characters have stumbled themselves into.This show is for those who are fans of serials and who like to watch series based in a full and very rich evironment.  Lost is tv at its best, though I must say it's best to watch it on DVD or on TIVO after a few weeks episodes have accumulated.WHy are you stil reading this?

632893,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00005JNOG,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[1, 1]","On the day of the 6th season premiere, I finally decided to watch Lost to cement the fact that I will forever be six years behind or ahead of pop culture. I would have watched sooner, but by the time I wanted to jump on the bandwagon, a lot of my friends jumped off, ""It was great for a while, then it just got weird"" they'd say. But now, with the final season upon us, and with my hearing that answers will be/have been given, I jumped on the fated Lost plane. Thus, this review will be in the context of a first-time viewer starting from the beginning, so forgive me if these facts are later changed, resolved, or otherwise not true in later seasons.Highlight Episodes:PilotWalkaboutAll The Best Cowboys Have Daddy IssuesHearts & MindsDeus Ex MachinaFrom the opening moments of death-dog, Vincent waking up our fateful hero, then finding out that a plane has crashed on an island, and the ensuing chaos that follows, Lost comes up with one of the best pilots in TV history. It's absolutely mesmerizing for anybody that watches it. How could you not become a fan after watching this? The beach scene not only has some great special effects, but the tension and feeling of terror on the beach is just so well-done. In fact, this scene is so iconic, every show like it that has come afterwards has tried to come up with their own version of this scene. Guess what, they all fail. What may seem like a simple scene, is actually an encapsulation of all that makes Lost a great show, at least in the first season.Another aspect of Lost that the show does so well, is that while it's most known for its story, it's characters hold the show together, and it's mostly what makes the characters so good. It's so hard to get to know so many people since it's an ensemble cast, but by the end of the season, you get a good sense of most/all of the characters, their motivations, and what brought them to the island.Jack is the reluctant leader who was told all of his life that he didn't have what it takes to be a hero (He's also the first of many characters we learn that has MAJOR daddy issues). Sawyer is the local conman, unlikable maybe, but he gives clever nicknames, so he can't be all bad. Locke is the local philosopher, always the wiser, he struggles with issues of faith. Sayid is the local Iraqi torturer. Hurley is the comical fat guy with a heart of gold and a harsh unlucky streak. Jin & Sun are the local Koreans that are surrounded by emotional and linguistic barriers. Charlie is the local drug-addicted former rockstar that finds a new addiction in the pregnant/sweet/cute Claire. Boone & Shannon are the high-class step-brother & sister that slept together. Michael & Walt are a father & son that struggle to build their relationship. And even though Kate is often criticized for being the worst character/actress, she's a tragic type who's built by circumstances, and only suffers because she's the least likable out of the whole cast.To build out and flesh out that big of a cast in only 25 episodes is an amazing accomplishment to me, especially since a lot of it comes in the form of well-placed flashbacks. And again, in this season at least, Lost puts its characters above its story. Sure, it may string you along with a few mysteries, Lost Season 1 was all about the characters. This is where Lost succeeds, and for me at least, makes it such a compelling watch.Overall, it's a must that you at least try the show out at least thought the pilot, and probably through episode 4 or 5. If you're not satisfied by this point, then you'll probably never be satisfied, and if you continue and make it through the whole season and you still don't like it, then just drop it. This is the best that Lost has offered so far, and to me, it's a TV gem.Also, if you've already seen this season, after you've seen the whole show, I hear it's equally comelling and facinating the 2nd time around. Which is always great when a show stands up to, and even benefits from repeat viewings.",5,"Guys, Where Are We?",1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,3987,"['day', '6th', 'season', 'premiere', 'finally', 'decided', 'watch', 'Lost', 'cement', 'fact', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'six', 'years', 'ahead', 'pop', 'culture', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'sooner', 'time', 'wanted', 'jump', 'bandwagon', 'lot', 'friends', 'jumped', 'off', 'was', 'great', 'while', 'then', 'just', 'got', 'weird', ""'d"", 'say', 'now', 'final', 'season', 'hearing', 'answers', 'will', 'be/have', 'been', 'given', 'jumped', 'fated', 'Lost', 'plane', 'Thus', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'context', 'first-time', 'viewer', 'starting', 'beginning', 'so', 'forgive', 'facts', 'are', 'later', 'changed', 'resolved', 'otherwise', 'not', 'true', 'later', 'seasons.Highlight', 'Episodes', 'PilotWalkaboutAll', 'Best', 'Cowboys', 'Have', 'Daddy', 'IssuesHearts', 'MindsDeus', 'Ex', 'MachinaFrom', 'opening', 'moments', 'death-dog', 'Vincent', 'waking', 'up', 'fateful', 'hero', 'then', 'finding', 'out', 'plane', 'crashed', 'island', 'ensuing', 'chaos', 'Lost', 'up', 'one', 'best', 'pilots', 'TV', 'history', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'anybody', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'become', 'fan', 'watching', 'beach', 'scene', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'tension', 'feeling', 'terror', 'beach', 'just', 'so', 'well-done', 'fact', 'scene', 'so', 'iconic', 'show', 'come', 'afterwards', 'tried', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'version', 'scene', 'Guess', 'what', 'fail', 'What', 'may', 'seem', 'simple', 'scene', 'actually', 'encapsulation', 'Lost', 'great', 'show', 'least', 'first', 'season.Another', 'aspect', 'Lost', 'show', 'so', 'well', 'most', 'known', 'story', 'characters', 'hold', 'show', 'together', 'mostly', 'what', 'characters', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'hard', 'get', 'know', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'end', 'season', 'get', 'good', 'sense', 'most/all', 'characters', 'motivations', 'what', 'brought', 'island.Jack', 'reluctant', 'leader', 'who', 'was', 'told', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'be', 'hero', 'also', 'first', 'many', 'characters', 'learn', 'MAJOR', 'daddy', 'issues', 'Sawyer', 'local', 'conman', 'unlikable', 'maybe', 'clever', 'nicknames', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'Locke', 'local', 'philosopher', 'always', 'wiser', 'issues', 'faith', 'Sayid', 'local', 'Iraqi', 'torturer', 'Hurley', 'comical', 'fat', 'guy', 'heart', 'gold', 'harsh', 'unlucky', 'streak', 'Jin', 'Sun', 'are', 'local', 'Koreans', 'are', 'surrounded', 'emotional', 'linguistic', 'barriers', 'Charlie', 'local', 'drug-addicted', 'former', 'rockstar', 'new', 'addiction', 'pregnant/sweet/cute', 'Claire', 'Boone', 'Shannon', 'are', 'high-class', 'step-brother', 'sister', 'slept', 'together', 'Michael', 'Walt', 'are', 'father', 'son', 'struggle', 'build', 'relationship', 'even', 'Kate', 'often', 'criticized', 'being', 'worst', 'character/actress', 'tragic', 'type', 'who', 'built', 'circumstances', 'only', 'suffers', 'least', 'likable', 'whole', 'cast.To', 'build', 'flesh', 'out', 'big', 'cast', 'only', '25', 'episodes', 'amazing', 'accomplishment', 'especially', 'lot', 'form', 'well-placed', 'flashbacks', 'again', 'season', 'least', 'Lost', 'characters', 'story', 'Sure', 'may', 'string', 'few', 'mysteries', 'Lost', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'characters', 'where', 'Lost', 'least', 'such', 'compelling', 'watch.Overall', 'must', 'least', 'try', 'show', 'out', 'least', 'thought', 'pilot', 'probably', 'episode', '4', '5', ""'re"", 'not', 'satisfied', 'point', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'satisfied', 'continue', 'make', 'whole', 'season', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'then', 'just', 'drop', 'best', 'Lost', 'offered', 'so', 'far', 'TV', 'gem.Also', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'season', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'whole', 'show', 'hear', 'equally', 'comelling', 'facinating', '2nd', 'time', 'Which', 'always', 'great', 'when', 'show', 'up', 'even', 'benefits', 'repeat', 'viewings']",Lost - The Complete First Season

632896,A1PXH1PFDDV7JX,B00005JNOG,"Frank Bitterhof ""Morpheus""","[1, 3]","I started watching the second season on LOST on TV a longer time ago but realized soon that in order to keep track and fully appreciate the show, it seemed better to postpone any further LOST watching until Season One and Two became available on Blu-ray (i.e. HD) and watch the show in chronological order (a wise decision as it has turned out to be).This is a unique, mesmerizing TV show with a special appeal to adult (i.e. mid-life) audiences, which among others draws inspiration from works like MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, SURVIVOR, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, THE PRISONER, various works of Stephen King and elements and clues that are reminiscent of better video games.That LOST's main creators, J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof, picked supporting actors from the BABYLON 5 universe, MATRIX:RELOADED and LORD OF THE RINGS, suggested to me on a subconscious level to have faith in this TV show, which has not been disappointed. On the contrary my early expectations in regard to LOST exceeded far beyond what I thought I could possibly expect.LOST achieves the seemingly impossible task of combining gritty reality with enchanting mystery. Just as in real-life and with friends and people we come to meet, we get to learn more and more about the characters through the means of flashbacks which eventually either turns us away from a character or establishes a bond through sympathy. Sensitive audiences may have difficulties with various scenes, especially during the first two seasons, but I felt it to be obvious that these were not intended to attract audiences hungry for blood and gore but to add to the realism (my wife had a hard time with the graphic, medical surgeries - especially in the pilot episodes - but I told her she should consider it a desensitization attempt of her fears, enabling her to provide first aid after a traffic accident...).And instead of graphically showing the dangers and 'monsters' of the island of LOST, the creators cleverly opted to address the spectators' own imagination instead (as it usually turns out to be more frightening what we do NOT see).The characters are three-dimensional, the (final) choice of actors is excellent and dialogues range from very good to simply outstanding. If there was any complaint I were asked to mention, it would be that I felt the romance triangle between Jack, Kate and Sawyer at times to be rather immature and not totally convincing (just my two cents). On the other hand LOST takes a firm stand against racial prejudice, with the Iraqi character of Sayid Jarrah beeing portrayed as one of the most common-sense, repentant survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 (my wife is of Christian Arab origin, she was positively shocked, because that was the last thing she would have expected from an American TV show). Through the Korean couple Sun-Hwa Kwon and her husband Jin-Soo Kwon, LOST also provides us with insights into Asian culture.While the aforementioned elements contribute to make LOST a unique, interesting and entertaining TV show, I feel the most remarkable and outstanding characteristic is the enormous range and diversity in the way the show explores ethical, philosophical and spiritual issues (with my personal highlight being a witty, verbal punch John - faith - delivers in a short dialogue with Jack - science - in the last episode of Season One).It seems some audiences have criticized LOST for the amount of 'puzzle pieces' the creators add on a regular basis while still beeing in the process of putting the early 'puzzle pieces' together, thus creating confusion and disorientation. Having now watched Seasons One through Three in a moderate 'marathon', my wife and I can't share this criticism.On the contrary I hope that J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof will resist the urge to put the entire puzzle together because that'll be be like putting a lid on the show which might be counter-productive to LOST becoming a timeless cult classic (in my humble opinion some loose ends will rather contribute to keep audiences busy to continue using their own imagination and interpretation as it is and has been with Patrick McGoohan's THE PRISONER).However, my wife found those LOST episodes confusing, that entered the realm of THE TWILIGHT ZONE where all of us were invited to deal with different scenarios of what this was all about (Hurley, Desmond and at the end of the third season Naomi, making a stirring claim which didn't seem improbable, given previous events and hints...). Ever since TOTAL RECALL and THE MATRIX, I, on the other hand, have cherished such an occasional ""mindf..."" and felt these episodes rather to be contributing to the diversity of LOST, than being a distraction.Looking forward to the second part of the story of LOST (i.e. Season Four through Six), I feel it is safe to suggest that among the ""100 things to do before you die"" watching this TV show ranks among the top positions. This show is asking important questions - and invites each and everyone of us to answer these questions in regard to our own, individual personal lifes. This not just another TV show, it is a profound experience.",5,A show that boldly goes where no other has gone before,1249603200,"08 7, 2009",2009,5102,"['started', 'watching', 'second', 'season',

632900,ALSNA5840Z14,B00005JNOG,fujiyama,"[3, 4]","Having watched few TV show over the last few years (I mostly watched news and sports), I began watching the first season on DVD, based on several recommendations from friends.I'll admit that at first, I wasn't quite 'hooked' the same way I was when I saw the pilot of '24' on DVD (the only other show I watch regularly now). Sure, I was impressed - the quality was amazing (both audio and video - it was meant to be seen in widescreen with a 5.1 system) and I wanted to watch more. But it didn't quite get me the way 24 did (but that's likely more due to the adreneline rush real time format of 24).As I started watching more episodes of Lost, I began to really appreciate the character and personality development. This is where Lost truly shines. You start to feel for the characters and their past. At times, the backstory for me tended to drag. I'd say it's the show's greatest strength and at times, weakness (in that you want to see more of island). But as you start watching later episodes, you realize the backstory provides info on how the characters were interconnected.I think what makes Lost's appeal so broad is not only each character's unique personality (all acted well), but it's ability to cut beyond genres. It's a bit sci fi, drama, comedy, action and adventure.Overall, it's a rewarding entertainment experience. Some shows truly shine on DVD. It's so much nicer to watch shows without ads and the ability to watch certain parts is great (especially with something like Lost).

I saw the first episode and was not completely drawn into it but I think interuptions and commercials had a lot to do with that. On DVD, commercial free... Lost truly reveals the gem it really is. Complete with diverse group of Castaways (48... but only a dozen or so are the focus of the show) the tale of survival goes into various directions. Each person has something in their past and while nothing really seems to add up as to why they are on the Island, it gives the viewer a deep insight into who each person is. Kate is a fugative but is she ""bad""... her flash backs indicate no, although they leave us craving to know exactly what it is she did. Jack is a doctor (a quite good one considereing how many people he saves with limited supplies) who was supposed to bring his father back for a funeral. Unfortunatley, the crash altered those plans, but his past comes back to haunt him in a near fatal way. John Locke is a mysterious hunter type who keeps to himself. His past is troubled with rejection and scams and he seems to find it hard to have faith in people, but he still does nice things for everyone else. Clair is pregnant and her baby seems to have a mysterious nature behind it... Jack Sawyer is bent on revenge and is quite cold towards everyone else... Hurley is a multi-millionaire who seems to be haunted by bad luck... Sayid is the Arab intellegence officer who everyone thought was responsible for the crash (his knowledge has helped with the survival very much though)... Shannon and Boone are step siblings who seem to be a little too involved with each other, and Sun and Jin are married, don't speak english, and are torn apart by the secrets each harbor. Michael and Walt are estranged father and son, brought together by the death of Walts mother.

632903,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B00005JNOG,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[1, 2]","""Lost: The Complete First Season"" is indeed the complete and essential set for ABC's hit new show on seven DVDs. Episodes are available only in English (perhaps sometime they'll be available in Spanish and other languages too) and are shown in widescreen. Sound quality is great as far as can tell, although I don't really have the most advanced sound system.There are a lot of special features, all decent, but some more notable then others. Therefore, I'll only comment on my favorites:The Art of Matthew FoxThis is very nice. Set along with a couple of the more touching scores from the show, Matthew Fox talks about a sort of photo album he did for the show, along with some original artwork.Lost Flashbacks and Deleted ScenesUnlike with some other shows or movies, you can tell that this isn't stuff that was cut because it was stupid, but rather because it either wasn't working with the story anymore or just for time. Now you can finally get to see and enjoy it.CommentaryThe commentary is definitely great to listen to. You'll find out what the writers and actors were thinking, why certain things happened the way they did, etc. And, if you have the captions on, you can rewatch the episode at the same time. There's commentary for four episodes, five if you count the Pilot as two episodes. This doesn't seem like necessarily a lot, but it's okay with me --- it's just enough without being too little, but not so much that it sort of goes into overload. Also, I was impressed by a very neat thing with the Pilot commentary where sometimes they'll switch out of the action of the show to take you to scenes from the filming and then once it's done, it seamlessly returns to the show. Cool feature.On Set with Jimmy KimmelThis is just plain amusing --- Jimmy Kimmel visits the sets and talks / cracks jokes with the cast and crew. He even collaborates with Dominic Monaghan on a ""theme song"" for the show.Previews for Other Shows and MoviesIncludes a number of previews and promos, including ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"" ""Alias,"" ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Lost"" second season.Perhaps the only slight disappointment about this DVD set is that it doesn't have any commentary on the finale, but I suppose maybe it was all put together a bit too late to do that, or they had a fear of it leaking out.",5,Superb DVD Set --- All Episodes and Great Bonus Features,1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,2318,"['Lost', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'indeed', 'complete', 'essential', 'set', 'ABC', 'hit', 'new', 'show', 'seven', 'DVDs', 'Episodes', 'are', 'available', 'only', 'English', 'perhaps', 'sometime', ""'ll"", 'be', 'available', 'Spanish', 'other', 'languages', 'too', 'are', 'shown', 'widescreen', 'Sound', 'quality', 'great', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'most', 'advanced', 'sound', 'are', 'lot', 'special', 'features', 'decent', 'more', 'notable', 'then', 'others', 'Therefore', ""'ll"", 'only', 'comment', 'favorites', 'Art', 'Matthew', 'FoxThis', 'very', 'nice', 'Set', 'couple', 'more', 'touching', 'scores', 'show', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'talks', 'sort', 'photo', 'album', 'did', 'show', 'original', 'artwork.Lost', 'Flashbacks', 'Deleted', 'ScenesUnlike', 'other', 'shows', 'movies', 'can', 'tell', ""n't"", 'stuff', 'was', 'cut', 'was', 'stupid', 'rather', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'story', 'anymore', 'just', 'time', 'Now', 'can', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'enjoy', 'it.CommentaryThe', 'commentary', 'definitely', 'great', 'listen', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'what', 'writers', 'actors', 'were', 'thinking', 'why', 'certain', 'things', 'happened', 'way', 'did', 'etc', 'have', 'captions', 'can', 'rewatch', 'episode', 'same', 'time', 'commentary', 'four', 'episodes', 'five', 'count', 'Pilot', 'two', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'seem', 'necessarily', 'lot', 'okay', 'just', 'enough', 'being', 'too', 'little', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'sort', 'overload', 'Also', 'was', 'impressed', 'very', 'neat', 'thing', 'Pilot', 'commentary', 'where', 'sometimes', ""'ll"", 'switch', 'action', 'show', 'take', 'scenes', 'filming', 'then', 'done', 'seamlessly', 'show', 'Cool', 'feature.On', 'Set', 'Jimmy', 'KimmelThis', 'just', 'plain', 'amusing', 'Jimmy', 'Kimmel', 'sets', 'talks', '/', 'cracks', 'jokes', 'cast', 'crew', 'even', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'theme', 'song', 'show.Previews', 'Other', 'Shows', 'MoviesIncludes', 'number', 'previews', 'promos', 'including', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'Alias', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Lost', 'second', 'only', 'slight', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'set', ""n't"", 'have', 'commentary', 'finale', 'suppose', 'maybe', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'bit', 'too', 'late', 'do', 'had', 'fear', 'leaking', 'out']",Lost - The Complete First Season

Listen - I dont care what colour the DVD's are, I buy and read reviews as to how good the programme/film is. So it is ok to review it prior to release.Ah, where do I start. Well what a disappointment. It really isnt as good as many have said here in my opinion. I loved the idea and concept. I was really hoping for some Twilight Zone-like series.What this is is a show where the whole script is dragged out to slowly get to plot milestones the director wants to get to. You know where someone will ask a crucial question like ""do you want to know what crime I committed"", the answer ""no, we all start fresh here"". You sit there thinking, yepp they are going to drag this out till episode 23432 when we'll find out then.This manic elongation of plot to spread it out over many episodes also results in two other things....The first is that for long periods very little happens. In fact its boring, or as the fans here say ""character development"", trust me its boring. Set against truly great moments like a tree crushing monster, the lulls are even more boring.The second is that a lot of illogical things happen, you find youself saying; ""they wouldnt have done that"". People running ALONE out to find a damn family dog when they've seen first hand that there is some sort of monster out there, (oh and they've a son who will be orphaned if they get killed). But no, out they run after the doggy. There are many more - like the Doctor going out to find the cockpit and putting himself in danger, when he should have known better - he's the doctor they need him. Finding a homing signal ""in the area"" and not going to look for it, but trekking back to the beach. etc etc Many more, but this would be a novel.And the kicker......here comes a spoiler. There is no solution after this long series...guess what....another series is next. Well it spoilt it to me. You invest all that time trudging through some interesting and intriguing twists and a LOT of dull chat and for what.....to reach no conclusion. If this were honed into a two hour film, it would probably be excellent, but over a long series no way.So in summary, could have been a classic, but fell into the ""..but the executives want a long series with the option of a second..."" bucket.

632907,A3A06ZU6QI9KIL,B00005JNOG,"G. Marshall ""Geoffrey Marshall""","[0, 0]","What makes Lost so addictive?The first time I saw Lost was in Anchorage, Alaska. I saw the promos for it, and decided to check it out; though I spent most of the two hour pilot divided between watching the show and talking to a friend on the phone. I didn't get a feel for the characters, and I thought it wasn't going to be worth following, but I gave it another shot the following week. After the first flashback, I was hooked...but why?I think it is because of the characters of this show. If the writers know what is good for them, they had better not lose sight of the fact that this is a character-driven show, even if it means that you have to account for all 14 or so main characters (plus the 4 or 5 semi-regulars). However, that doesn't mean to say that the plot elements on the show are to be tossed by the wayside; oh no! Perish the thought! It is simply that while the plot elements thus far are quite intriguing, what makes it all tick is the character interaction to these plot elements.So, what has happened on the show in the past season? It's...well...almost impossible to tell without watching it. One can tell of the island events, but that's only half the story if you don't know the flashbacks to life events that helped shape each character and influence their reaction to the island events. The Cliffnotes version is...the plane crashes, everyone sees weird stuff happening on the island, monsters uproot trees, polar bears attack, fights occur, people begin to pull together, an infiltrator tries to steal a pregnant girl, and gets wasted by a drug addict for his trouble, a hatch is discovered and when opened, a Scotsman is found....a PIRATE SHIP is found inland (almost forgot about that), and the people in the tail end of the plane meet up with the main people.That doesn't even begin to do it justice, and the second season thus far is even more involved.I'd be hard-pressed to give you a fave character. If I were forced, I'd say it's a tie between Locke and Eko at this stage...I would have said Locke before Eko came along, but now it's a tie...however, the characters I like the best besides those two are Sun (hot!), Sayid, and Jin. I liked Michael, and I guess I still do, but his nutjob actions recently are kind of making me less sympathetic...I like Hurley but I need some more interaction between his storyline and the island storyline to get him on a higher level of concern. I'm interested in most of the other storylines to see how they interact with the island story but my least fave character is Kate. Not that I hate the acting (because I don't) but she is just an annoying character as portayed in this episode past. I don't want to get rid of her though. Yet. I used to be annoyed by Sawyer, but his redemption thread was getting interesting...until he proved himself nigh-unredeemable! Jack, I'm conflicted about. He's the unofficial leader of the group, his flashbacks are interesting, he's involved in a lot of the stuff that goes on...but he needs a huge chill pill.I don't hate Ana Lucia like many others do. I'm willing to wait and see what goes on with her later.While I didn't hate Boone or Shannon, I agree that they were the least likely to be missed if they died. I fear that Claire is headed into the same region right now, since she's had the baby and nothing much has been said of that. At least Charlie has been doing stuff on the island, irritating though he is...but I'm intrigued by his character, I'll see where it goes.Do not mess with the Others. Who are they anyways? I do believe that they are the de Groots (the leaders) but who are the other people?And finally, the deux ex machina characters, who pop up at various times as plot catalysts...like Desmond and Danielle. No flashbacks for them, but they have their own story to tell...I can't wait to see what's next for the castaways! In my tier of shows, I wouldn't put Lost as better than ""The Wire"" or ""Battlestar Galactica"", but it would be a little bit higher than ""24"" and ""The Sopranos"".

Once again it ended with something to do with the hatch.  It didn't leave you oh my god, but oh I could have seen that coming.  My opinion don't buy LOST.  It isn't worth the $40.

632911,A32CG0V371FRQ2,B00005JNOG,GratedTopping,"[2, 4]","As for the product, the DVDs arrangement and extras are fine. Concerning the show, I wasn't impressed and lost interest rather quickly. Fortunately, I was able to borrow the first season from the local library and the only thing lost was some time. I could only get the first five DVDs of this 7-disc set since five was the maximum that could be obtained at a time. I reluctantly borrowed the final two DVDs (one with episodes; one with bonus features) today and I gave it a shot. A couple of the episodes in the season were okay, but it's not enough.I didn't really care about any of the characters and it was just rather silly to me. I think it's important in a drama show to get the feeling that the actors are 'hiding' that they are acting. With this one, everyone seemed so fake and over-blown, hamming it up for the camera. Too many emotions seemed fake.Maybe the rest of the seasons were better, but I couldn't get into it. If I had watched this on TV, I know I would have been curious for the first 3-4 episodes. While watching this season over a couple days, it never became anything where I felt I was hooked and had to know what happened next. I never really cared and there wasn't enough to even get me to remember the previous episode (even though I was watching them all in a row). I didn't like the flashbacks all the time, yet I guess that was necessary to learn about the characters. The scenery was the best part of the series.What got me 'mad' right in the first episode: nobody even talked about the plane crash! I kept waiting to see what I thought would be the first thing on people's minds. What the heck caused the disaster and why didn't anybody seem to care? It seemed like it was handled as a common event in the survivor's lives. ""Well, it's just one of those days. The plane crashed, so let's just make ourselves at home. Can anybody help me wipe myself with one of this leaves?""I read about the rest of the series, learned about the final episode, and didn't care. I'm glad I wasn't one of the people who got hooked when it was airing, only to end up seeing a crappy letdown with questions and no real answers. Of course, some people think it ended fine but I would have hated it. I have no interest in seeing any other episodes.Too bad I was fooled with the recent ""FlashForward"" -- a show I was hooked on that had a terrible final episode for a series in which it was promised that it wouldn't end that way. At least it wasn't on as long, though. ""Quantum Leap"" was another classic I liked that ended terribly. 1995-1996's ""Nowhere Man"" remains my favourite show ever and, even though it had some silly episodes and the ending was not a completely satisfying finale, it was surely a better ending then QL or FF and, from what I've learned, would have eclipsed this show's as well.",2,"I searched, but LOST remained that way...",1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,2812,"['product', 'DVDs', 'arrangement', 'extras', 'are', 'fine', 'Concerning', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'lost', 'interest', 'rather', 'quickly', 'Fortunately', 'was', 'able', 'borrow', 'first', 'season', 'local', 'library', 'only', 'thing', 'lost', 'was', 'time', 'could', 'only', 'get', 'first', 'five', 'DVDs', '7-disc', 'set', 'five', 'was', 'maximum', 'could', 'be', 'obtained', 'time', 'reluctantly', 'borrowed', 'final', 'two', 'DVDs', 'one', 'episodes', 'one', 'bonus', 'features', 'today', 'gave', 'shot', 'couple', 'episodes', 'season', 'were', 'okay', 'not', 'enough.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'was', 'just', 'rather', 'silly', 'think', 'important', 'drama', 'show', 'get', 'feeling', 'actors', 'are', ""'hiding"", 'are', 'acting', 'one', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'so', 'fake', 'over-blown', 'hamming', 'up', 'camera', 'Too', 'many', 'emotions', 'seemed', 'fake.Maybe', 'rest', 'seasons', 'were', 'better', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'had', 'watched', 'TV', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'curious', 'first', '3-4', 'episodes', 'watching', 'season', 'couple', 'days', 'never', 'became', 'anything', 'where', 'felt', 'was', 'hooked', 'had', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'even', 'get', 'remember', 'previous', 'episode', 'even', 'was', 'watching', 'row', 'did', ""n't"", 'flashbacks', 'time', 'yet', 'guess', 'was', 'necessary', 'learn', 'characters', 'scenery', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'series.What', 'got', ""'mad"", 'right', 'first', 'episode', 'nobody', 'even', 'talked', 'plane', 'crash', 'kept', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'thing', 'people', 'minds', 'What', 'heck', 'caused', 'disaster', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'seem', 'care', 'seemed', 'was', 'handled', 'common', 'event', 'survivor', 'lives', 'Well', 'just', 'one', 'days', 'plane', 'crashed', 'let', 'just', 'make', 'ourselves', 'home', 'Can', 'anybody', 'help', 'wipe', 'one', 'read', 'rest', 'series', 'learned', 'final', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'got', 'hooked', 'when', 'was', 'airing', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'seeing', 'crappy', 'letdown', 'questions', 'real', 'answers', 'course', 'people', 'think', 'ended', 'fine', 'would', 'have', 'hated', 'have', 'interest', 'seeing', 'other', 'episodes.Too', 'bad', 'was', 'fooled', 'recent', 'FlashForward', 'show', 'was', 'hooked', 'had', 'terrible', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'was', 'promised', 'would', ""n't"", 'end', 'way', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'though', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'was', 'classic', 'liked', 'ended', 'terribly', '1995-1996', 'Nowhere', 'Man', 'favourite', 'show', 'ever', 'even', 'had', 'silly', 'episodes', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'finale', 'was', 'surely', 'better', 'ending', 'then', 'QL', 'FF', 'what', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'would', 'have', 'eclipsed', 'show', 'as', 'well']",Lost - The Complete First Season

I just hope they don't kill any of the characters i like.this show is pretty violent too, the pilot episode with the plane crash, wow, i couldn't believe they showed that. and the one part on the season finally with Arzt, i was not expecting that.this show also got into my ultimate favorite shows list by its creative comedy the developers made, the one episode with Sayid, and the terrists were playing Half-Life, on tv, and if you are a Half-Life fanatic like i am, you would probably consider this one of the biggest inside jokes i've ever seen in the mainstream. (incase you didn't get it, Counter-strike, a very well known mod, is a total conversion based on Half-life. in the mod, it is Terrists Vs.

632925,A1A535W556ROBQ,B00005JNOG,James Ferguson,"[0, 1]","It is really hard to guage this series on the first season since it has now had four more seasons to develop its stories and characters, and has gained such a devoted following.  However, I for one had a lot of qualms with season one, which struck me as very discordant.I have a feeling that Abrams and co. had no idea what they were getting into at the start.  What begins as a plane crash on an apparently remote island soon takes on many mysterious tones with a huge ensemble cast not much unlike those old Airport movies from the 70s.  The cast is made up of relative unknowns giving the show the initial feeling of a staged reality show, but the writing has a lot of gaps, and the actors really seem to struggle with their roles in the early going.But, a core group soon emerges, much to the chagrin of the other ""Lostaways"" such as Arzt, which pretty much carries the action.  Even still it is a pretty big group and doesn't break down easily along the lines of other castaway shows like Gilligan's Island, but I can't help seeing Jack and Kate as the Professor and Mary Ann.The writers, who earned their chops on such shows as Nash Bridges, Alias, Brisco County Jr. and Six Degrees seem to take elements from near and far when it comes to island movies and TV serials.  One can't help but sense the menacing feel of Jules Verne's Mysterious Island or even H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau, but the threads that develop seem to come more from the 70s, when we were all absorbed with Bermuda triangle theories, alien encounters and supernatural thrillers.  The Island gives them a lush venue to update these themes and keep you going with a number of tantalizing threads.Unfortunately, the writing stumbles and falters and the situations don't bear up that well under scrutiny.

632927,A2LPCZ7UBT4Y6N,B00005JNOG,"Jameson L. Thottam ""mortgage maven""","[5, 11]","Jameson L. Thottam review of Lost - First SeasonI am very hard to please when it comes to dramas. Very few dramas keep my interest because I normally find the characters predictable and boring. I am just shocked that I was so fascinated with this.Opening Discussion - Jameson ThottamThe opening of the show was fabulous and quickly grabbed my interest. How can a traumatic moment like a plane crash be boring? Of course it's not handed to us at the opening of the show. Bits and pieces of information are rationed out so the inquisitive viewer keeps watching. The show truly does a very good job of revealing information about the characters, the setting and the past just a little at a time to keep the viewer guessing and interesed all the way through the show.The Island - Jameson ThottamThe island has its own mystery. No one from civilization knows where to look for the airplane. The survivors anticipate that the plane went down 1,000 miles off course. They soon realize that the last plane that crashed on the island was never rescued. They also discover there are wild animals on the island which can be a danger to them.The viewer gets an opportunity to consider if the island is enchanted and exactly what kind of animals are on the island. A lot of things that shouldn't be possible seem to happen on the island and seem to defeat scientific explanation such as the way the aircraft landed with so many unharmed. Some people on the island believe they are on the island because of fate while others believe it's purely chance. Isolated incidences are revealed and eventually even the castaways start talking about it. Nothing is simple to answer or explain. The characters say if you want it bad enough the island will give it to you.Uniqueness - Jameson ThottamMost shows are predictable and you know a character's personality well enough to know what they're going to do next and how they will act when presented with a situation but we have an island full of unpredictable individuals. The viewer may attribute it to the fact that they just had a traumatic experience or the situation they are in which changes them. One minute a character looks like a hero, the next minute they look like the enemy. Sometimes it looks like a character is trying to sabotage the rescue but who would want to do that and why?Character Interplay - Jameson ThottamThe crash happened so we start to see how the individuals reacted to each other and started to get to know them. One by one we started seeing flashes from their past. We saw what decisions were made in their life that put them on this particular flight. It would be so easy for the viewer to say, yea, how convenient for the writer to put a hunter and doctor on the plane. I know I thought it was too convenient, ridiculously convenient. But then the viewer gets more insight to see that these people had reasons why they were on this particular flight and not just any flight. We see why the characters are on this particular plane and I began to wonder if that was supposed to mean something. Perhaps that was another clue about the movie because the characters as different as they are seem to have unusual things in common.I absolutely love how the characters unfold for us because it gives the viewer an opportunity to formulate ideas. The longer I watched the more ideas I formulated about where the story was going. But I was wrong. I found this show very suspenseful and unique.Final Episode - Jameson ThottamThe final episode is more like the beginning of the next season. Instead of having answers I had more questions. Too many questions to sleep. I am anxiously waiting for season two which starts on ABC September 21, 2005. The synopsis for season two sounds really exciting with some new developments and should prove to be just as exciting as season one. There's no way that I could possibly wait until the DVD comes out, I'll have to watch it on TV.Jameson L.

632928,A35YZ7VRAKV4AA,B00005JNOG,Jamie Mathena,"[1, 1]","I got Lost Season 1 as a gift about 2 years ago.  I had never seen the show and I really hadnt though about seeing it either.  One lonely night, I sat home with nothing to do, so I decided why not.  I popped the DVD in the player and watched the first episode and the second and the third.  I think I got up to episode 6 before I realized I needed to go to bed so I could get at least a few hours of sleep before work.  As soon as I got home I thought, screw working out today.  Stuck the DVD in and watched another 6 or episodes or so.  I was dont with season 1 in 3 or 4 days.  I watched the whole season again then headed out to Wal-Mart to get Season 2 (Even though I didnt have the money, I didnt care).  Once season 2 was over, I watched season 3 on my computer at work during lunches..and while the boss was out.  So I guess you could say I'm hooked.How could anyone not like this show?  There are a wide variety of different characters and they all are very well rounded and interesting.  The whole concept of the flashbacks is just genius.  Then you have the island.  Smoke monsters, healing powers, people who never age, numbers that have some kind of power, The Dharma Initiative.  This is sci-fi at its best.  You also have a lot of drama and some comedy.  If you havent seen this show, I would recommend buying season 1 or at least dowloading the pilot episode.

632929,AQ67M4B2HTYZ6,B00005JNOG,Janna Jansen,"[4, 4]","A plane crashes into the sea on an island, after travelling for two hours in the wrong direction.  One part of the plane lands of one side of the island, and the other on the other side.  Two groups of people survive, many die.  Both groups spend a week or two waiting on the beach, burying the dead, and wondering what to do next.  Both move away from the beaches when it becomes apparent that they are not safe there.This is brilliant because in each episode you learn more about each person, for example the episode focussing on Ana Lucia showed us she was actually an cop (and a tough one), who was shot while pregnant, lost the baby and now carries a massive chip on her shoulder.  She killed the guy who shot her -in cold blood.Just about everyone on the island seems to be harbouring a dark secret.And then there are ""the others""... who are they, what are they doing on the island and why are they hostile?

632930,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B00005JNOG,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[1, 1]","When Oceanic Flight 815 from Australia to Los Angeles wrecks in the middle of nowhere, the survivors find themselves stranded on a deserted island in the middle of the ocean. Led by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), a doctor back home, the survivors fend for themselves looking for shelter, hunting for food, and having to find clean water while trying to get the word out that there are survivors of the devastating crash. But when unexplainable events occur, including polar bear attacks, the new residents of the island begin to ponder the meaning of their existence on the island. Furthermore, they may not be alone.I'm just a little late jumping on the Lost bandwagon, partially by choice. After missing the first few episodes due to scheduling conflicts, and hearing that missing an episode would cause you to be, for lack of a better word, lost in the series, I figured I would hold off until they were further into the series before picking up the DVD's to check it out. As time went on Lost became a ""water cooler sensation"" and I wanted to dive in, but with the love/hate relationship people had with the series slowly unravelling it's mysteries making it pertinent that you not miss a single episode, I thought it would be better to wait till near the end of the series to start the first season. So here I am. The sixth and final season starts on February 2, 2010 and I just finished season 1. Was it worth the wait?Absolutely! With Lost, JJ Abrams and his team of producers and writers have created a fresh and intriguing story with characters that feel real with real arcs. Each episode focuses on an issue on the island while also focusing on a specific character's past. Even though each episode follows this patter it never feels gimmicky and allows the writers to further flesh out the characters in an interesting and inventive way, while also giving story arcs that will further flesh out the world and mythology of Lost in seasons to come.A lot has been made of how Lost keeps piling on mysteries while slowly solving them, if at all. After watching the first season you can definitely see the seeds of this starting to bloom, but since the first season is an introduction to the characters and their predicament, mysteries are part of the territory. Still, for better in my opinion, as the writers let you in on one secret another two or three in most cases are bound to pop up. Since this process always feels organic rather than feeling like a gimmick to keep ratings up, it keeps the viewer intrigued in the story while making the viewing experience more interactive as you try to figure out the mysteries on your own.The acting in this show is top notch, probably one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen for television next to Battlestar Galactica and this season's Flash Forward. With a cast that includes Naveen Andrews (Grindhouse: Planet Terror), Matthew Fox (Party of Five), Daniel Dae Kim (Crash), Evangeline Lilly (The Hurt Locker), and Dominic Monaghan (Lord of the Rings) they found a cast that more than excels at the challenge of bringing this story and these characters to life. Of all the great actors on this show, the one that really stuck out for me though is Terry O'Quinn (Primal Fear, Tombstone, The Rocketeer). As John Locke, O'Quinn really makes you feel every tick of this character, and with a character like Locke, who starts off making you wonder about his secrets and his allegiances that's not an easy task. As the season carries on you see him bring out the psychological and emotional scars buried beneath the confident exterior of the character.If you haven't checked out Lost I highly recommend that you jump on this wagon. The first season is a brilliant ride that will keep you guessing and engrossed in the characters. Since I've started the first season I've had a hard time putting the series down to do or watch anything else. I can't wait to get started on the second season now!5/5",5,Lost Season 1,1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,3947,"['When', 'Oceanic', 'Flight', '815', 'Australia', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'wrecks', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'survivors', 'find', 'stranded', 'deserted', 'island', 'middle', 'ocean', 'Led', 'Jack', 'Shephard', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'doctor', 'back', 'home', 'survivors', 'fend', 'looking', 'shelter', 'hunting', 'food', 'having', 'find', 'clean', 'water', 'trying', 'get', 'word', 'are', 'survivors', 'devastating', 'crash', 'when', 'unexplainable', 'events', 'occur', 'including', 'polar', 'bear', 'attacks', 'new', 'residents', 'island', 'begin', 'ponder', 'meaning', 'existence', 'island', 'Furthermore', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'alone.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'little', 'late', 'jumping', 'Lost', 'bandwagon', 'partially', 'choice', 'missing', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'due', 'scheduling', 'conflicts', 'hearing', 'missing', 'episode', 'would', 'cause', 'be', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'lost', 'series', 'figured', 'would', 'hold', 'off', 'were', 'further', 'series', 'picking', 'up', 'DVD', 'check', 'out', 'time', 'went', 'Lost', 'became', 'water', 'cooler', 'sensation', 'wanted', 'dive', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'people', 'had', 'series', 'slowly', 'unravelling', 'mysteries', 'making', 'pertinent', 'not', 'miss', 'single', 'episode', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'wait', 'till', 'end', 'series', 'start', 'first', 'season', 'So', 'here', 'am', 'sixth', 'final', 'season', 'February', '2', '2010', 'just', 'finished', 'season', '1', 'Was', 'wait', 'Absolutely', 'Lost', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'team', 'producers', 'writers', 'have', 'created', 'fresh', 'intriguing', 'story', 'characters', 'feel', 'real', 'real', 'arcs', 'episode', 'issue', 'island', 'also', 'focusing', 'specific', 'character', 'past', 'Even', 'episode', 'patter', 'never', 'gimmicky', 'writers', 'further', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'interesting', 'inventive', 'way', 'also', 'giving', 'story', 'arcs', 'will', 'further', 'flesh', 'out', 'world', 'mythology', 'Lost', 'seasons', 'come.A', 'lot', 'been', 'made', 'how', 'Lost', 'piling', 'mysteries', 'slowly', 'solving', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'seeds', 'starting', 'bloom', 'first', 'season', 'introduction', 'characters', 'predicament', 'mysteries', 'are', 'part', 'territory', 'Still', 'better', 'opinion', 'writers', 'let', 'one', 'secret', 'two', 'three', 'most', 'cases', 'are', 'bound', 'pop', 'up', 'process', 'always', 'rather', 'feeling', 'gimmick', 'keep', 'ratings', 'up', 'viewer', 'intrigued', 'story', 'making', 'viewing', 'experience', 'more', 'interactive', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'mysteries', 'own.The', 'acting', 'show', 'top', 'notch', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'ensemble', 'casts', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'season', 'Flash', 'Forward', 'cast', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'Grindhouse', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Party', 'Five', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'Crash', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'found', 'cast', 'more', 'excels', 'challenge', 'bringing', 'story', 'characters', 'life', 'great', 'actors', 'show', 'one', 'really', 'stuck', 'out', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Primal', 'Fear', 'Tombstone', 'Rocketeer', 'John', 'Locke', ""O'Quinn"", 'really', 'feel', 'tick', 'character', 'character', 'Locke', 'who', 'off', 'making', 'wonder', 'secrets', 'allegiances', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'season', 'see', 'bring', 'out', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'scars', 'buried', 'confident', 'exterior', 'character.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'checked', 'out', 'Lost', 'highly', 'recommend', 'jump', 'wagon', 'first', 'season', 'brilliant', 'ride', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'engrossed', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'started', 'first', 'season', ""'ve"", 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'putting', 'series', 'down', 'do', 'watch', 'anything', 'else', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'started', 'second', 'season', 'now', '5/5']",Lost - The Complete First Season

632932,A39NGYK97FBZM3,B00005JNOG,"J. B Kraft ""lonestargazer""","[9, 9]","My wife and I watch almost no TV with commercials, and we never saw this series on TV. It was recommended to me separately by four friends during the season, but they had the sense to tell me not to try to jump in the middle of the season -- that the background was just too necessary to a full appreciation.Since there are other excellent reviews that cover the details, I will just offer my impressions as to why Season I ranks high among the great TV shows of all time.First, if you love mysteries and unfolding them, you will love this series. It is impossible to pidgeonhole this program into one genre--adventure, because at times it has the ""flavor"" of sci-fi, of mystery, of horror. Attempting to predict where the writers will take the episodes from prior clues is intriguing and challenging. Foreshadowing often occurs, but is refreshingly subtle.Second, if you love thoughtful, interesting, and developing characters in fiction, you can't help but admire the masterful way that writing, acting and directing combine to make us care about these characters and watch develpment as the episodes slowly reveal key pasts of characters that wonderfully explain their flaws and strengths.Thirdly, if you like stories of redemption--of characters who are transformed by unusual events or circumstances, you will enjoy getting to know these actors in these rolls.Finally, this set reminds me of the distinction between entertainment and art.

632933,A2DKWKZB0ZIFNA,B00005JNOG,J. D. Grey,"[13, 52]","I started watching Lost for two main reasons.  One: The creator of Lost is also the creator of my favorite show - Alias.  (Go JJ Abrams)  Two: The trailers made it look like an awesome, freaky monster flick.  I tuned in for the premiere and I absolutely loved it.  I was a lost fan.  The premiere episode had everything that was needed for a premiere ep.  Characters were starting to build relationships and there was suspense around every corner.  It was a phenominal episode.As the season progressed though it started to get dull. The first ep was full of the monster but the rest of the eps went on to reveal things about the characters.  Don't get me wrong, it was cool seeing how everything came to be and I liked the originality of how they did the flashbacks, but it got repetative and dull.Also, some of the things were just plain too out there.  One character (Awesome Terry O'Quinn - also from Alias) was paralyzed but after the crash he could walk.  Also, some guy had numbers that he thought were unlucky.  OOH spooky.  It just got to unbelievable.The main point of the season is ""the hatch""  They find it about half-way through the season.  Then they spend like 10 episodes trying to open it.  The finale give absolutely no answers to the questions that they arose.Overall, Lost really drags on the story (what else can they do? They're stuck on an island) If I were you, just stick to buying the pilot DVD or just watch on TV.

We see each character's soul exposed in flashbacks.

632940,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B00005JNOG,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[5, 7]","Lost was rejected by some viewers just due to all the re-runs. Which is probably the only excuse anyone could come up with to not like this show. It's a poor excuse too. Sure re-runs are frustrating when you're hooked on a show and want new episodes. However I remember times when Buffy or Smallville were on re-runs for weeks and weeks. I've even seen 1 star reviews here for that reason and it's just dumb. Every show has a big ammount of re-run breaks after a certain time. If you're hating on this show for that reason and then you're a baby and this show is too good for you lol.Lost offers engaging stories, a fine cast, interesting plot twists and some of the best acting I've seen on tv in years. A plane crashes on an island and 40 people survive. There's only 14 of them that we really get to know though. Matthew Foxx plays a doctor named Jack who takes charge of the situation. Whenever there's a problem people come to him. Whether someone needs to be attended to or if they're out of bottled water, he's the man they complain to. Since he always does the right thing, he's not a bad guy to have in charge. There's also Kate (Evangeline Lilly) who's a misunderstood women on the run. She and Jack  strike a friendship right away with some friendly flirtation. They'll probably get together sooner or later. But she also has Sawyer (Josh Holloway) as an option . He's a slick wiseass who's also misunderstood and fighting inner-demons as well. Both can have trouble getting people to trust them too.Although Jack, Kate and Sawyer have their love triangle going on. This isn't no mushy soup opera. It's about people who were lost before they even got on the island.  Because they were lost almost mentally and  find themselves again on that island. We get flashbacks showing how their lives weren't exactly great before the island. Plus the show is brilliant how it handles prejudice and humanity. How people get things done quicker if they learn to get along.It also has it's supernatural side with something lurking in the jungle ripping survivors of the crash to shreds. Plus with a crippled survivor finding he can walk after the crash  on the island. A pregnant women who gets told by a Psychic that only she can raise her baby and that it's special. Also polar bears  are on the island causing havoc and no one knows how they got there. They also have to contend with dangerous mysterious people that weren't even on the plane.Lost is the most daring and unpredictable show to land on tv in a long long time. This review doesn't even give the show justice to how good it is. There's so much to cover but it's better to just let you see for yourself if you haven't already.

And this might be the first in the bag. Delving into the extras, you discover why this series is so good. It was rushed into production, all the obvious actors were already cast in other pilots, the producers/writers were forced to cast the best actors and rewrite the open-ended script to fit them (Sawyer was originally a Buffalo NY slicker, but they didn't even ask Josh Holloway to try the accent, in fact reprimanded him when he did); and they have obviously read Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"", Flann O'Brien and his human surrealism (featured in a shot, causing a spike in interest in the little known, long-dead Irish genius) and I suspect Borges and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. As well as comic books, Grimm's fairy tales, Dante's ""Inferno"", etc. The very best dramas seem to be written in a rush of inspiration, with almost desperate energy to realize it while its flash is fresh in the mind. That they managed to do this with a television show is almost miraculous (""The Prisoner"", which is shorter, was similarly conceived and executed). I suspect the ace in the whole is that the tail section survived on the other side of the island and in two years we'll see events from their perspective, so enjoy Sawyer, Hurley, Kate and the others while their salary demands are reasonable. Given what they've achieved so far, the producers will probably be forgiven. Hopefully they will avoid the rabbit hole ""The Prisoner"" fell into in its last episode (McGoohan had to hide out as he was literally physically attacked for it), but as with most stories it's the journey not the destination that matters. Even if ""Lost"" declines, this season justifies its existance regardless. Personally, I found this DVD set after a series of deaths in my family and laid up with a torn ligament in my calf (dodging a cab, I fared better than Michael), and it was immensely healing as a distraction. May I recommend it as that (and warn against it or any other television series as an obsession). It is good enough to become either. PS They will never have to explain The Monster any more than McGoohan had to explain the bouncing menacing roaring white blobs. I hope they never do. PPS In a cast this large, the lack of a gay character is rather glaring, though there was one line that indicated Boone was (posthumous backstory to come?). It's not too late for Sawyer to turn, of course. Or Kate, for that matter.

632952,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00005JNOG,John Kwok,"[5, 5]","""Lost"" is unquestionably among the best television series currently airing on American network (not cable) television. It works as a spellbinding character-driven fantasy and science fiction series about a group of forty-odd survivors of an airplane crash lost in a remote mysterious Pacific island. As a character-driven series with an overarching plot arc, it resembles most closely ""Babylon 5"", with a cast of characters as complex as any aboard the 22nd Century space station. These include Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), a former Iraqi soldier, Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), the unexpected winner of a lottery,  Kate Austin (Evangeline Lilly), and Jack Shepherd (Matthew Fox), the doctor who unexpectedly becomes the leader of the survivors. Veterans of other science fiction and fantasy television shows and films are included in this cast: Daniel Dae Kim from ""Crusade"", portrays the enigmatic Korean businessman Jin Kwon; Terry O'Quinn, whose roles include ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", portrays the equally enigmatic John Locke; Dominic Monaghan from ""The Lord of the Rings"" is drug-addicted rock musician Charlie Pace. Each of the episodes have focused in depth on one or more of these main characters and others in the cast, confronting secrets as diverse as a mysterious man-killing monster and Danielle (Mira Furlan from ""Babylon 5""), the lonely half-mad French survivor of another plane wreck on the island. While some may find that the plots seem to drag out needlessly, most will instead appreciate how well the cast and creators of ""Lost"" have built up the show to an intriguing climatic first season conclusion which may or may not resolve the fates of several in the cast.",5,Splendid Fantasy Series for American Television,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,1701,"['Lost', 'unquestionably', 'best', 'television', 'series', 'currently', 'airing', 'American', 'network', 'not', 'cable', 'television', 'spellbinding', 'character-driven', 'fantasy', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'group', 'forty-odd', 'survivors', 'airplane', 'crash', 'lost', 'remote', 'mysterious', 'Pacific', 'island', 'character-driven', 'series', 'overarching', 'plot', 'arc', 'most', 'closely', 'Babylon', '5', 'cast', 'characters', 'as', 'complex', '22nd', 'Century', 'space', 'station', 'include', 'Sayid', 'Jarrah', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'former', 'Iraqi', 'soldier', 'Hugo', 'Hurley', 'Reyes', 'Jorge', 'Garcia', 'unexpected', 'winner', 'lottery', 'Kate', 'Austin', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'Jack', 'Shepherd', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'doctor', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'leader', 'survivors', 'Veterans', 'other', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'television', 'shows', 'films', 'are', 'included', 'cast', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'Crusade', 'enigmatic', 'Korean', 'businessman', 'Jin', 'Kwon', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'roles', 'include', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'equally', 'enigmatic', 'John', 'Locke', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'drug-addicted', 'rock', 'musician', 'Charlie', 'Pace', 'episodes', 'have', 'focused', 'depth', 'one', 'more', 'main', 'characters', 'others', 'cast', 'confronting', 'secrets', 'as', 'diverse', 'mysterious', 'man-killing', 'monster', 'Danielle', 'Mira', 'Furlan', 'Babylon', '5', 'lonely', 'half-mad', 'French', 'survivor', 'plane', 'wreck', 'island', 'may', 'find', 'plots', 'seem', 'drag', 'out', 'needlessly', 'most', 'will', 'instead', 'appreciate', 'how', 'well', 'cast', 'creators', 'Lost', 'have', 'built', 'up', 'show', 'intriguing', 'climatic', 'first', 'season', 'conclusion', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'resolve', 'fates', 'several', 'cast']",Lost - The Complete First Season
632953,A1AT0GONN4A9NA,B00005JNOG,"John P. Morgan ""Light Coach""","[9, 9]","Last year my wife turned on the television to watch the season premier of LOST. From that one viewing we were instantly hooked. For a present, I bought my wife...or was it really for me...the DVD boxed set. We have watched it several times already.It is not some mindless show. You can't watch it while doing other things. You have to pay attention and that's something that is, sadly, a LOST art...no pun intended.With every episode there is a backstory for each character. You get a small glimpse of the person's life before they ended up on this strange island. I have my own personal thoughts and feelings as to what the island represents but I will keep them to myself and let you arrive at your own conclusions.If I only could watch one television show, it would have to be LOST. The writers of this show has found a way to consistently grab me and now that I am aware that there are hidden clues in each episode, I am even more intrigued and it is very exciting to notice something that I didn't notice before because it keeps the show fresh and alive.I happen to like watching the DVDs better than watching it on television for obvious reasons...no annoying commercials and also I can basically watch two episodes in 90 minutes rather than just one at 60 minutes on regular television.As far as extras go, there really isn't that much that's too amazing. There's a pretty good documentary on how they made the season premier but everything else is kind of ho-hum.

632954,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B00005JNOG,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[24, 64]","I really wanted to like this show.  My favorite series of the past few years (""The Shield"" and ""The Wire"") had ended, and I wanted a new show to enjoy and get hooked on.  I knew ""Lost"" was already several years old by that point, but I figured I could start from the beginning with the DVDs and get caught up quickly.However, this show stinks so bad, I am having a hard time getting the smell out of my DVD player.This show is overwrought melodrama, and is full of manufactured tension and forced dialogue and situations.  The premise is fine (and even interesting), but the dozens of little moments used to fill the time between plot developments are ridiculously melodramatic.  The show doesn't have to be realistic, but there needs to be some verisimilitude -- the actions, dialogue, etc of the characters need to be grounded in reality and naturalism (even in a surreal or fantastical context) or else it looks cartoonish.Watching this show has helped me become a master at physical multi-tasking:  I can now yawn and roll my eyes at the same time.  I never saw the show until August of 2009.  My boss recommended it to me (we were both huge fans of ""The Shield"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"", so I was willing to accept his recommendation).  I rented Season 1 of ""Lost"" from Netflix and somehow managed to watch almost the entire season without wanting to slit my wrists from boredom or having my eyes roll permanently into the back of their sockets.  It wasn't easy to get through the season, that's for sure.  It was quite the endurance contest.  The most notable reaction I had to this show (other than intellectual agony) was when I ran, and I mean RAN, to my computer to delete the rest of the season's discs from my Netflix queue.The premise was interesting, but that's where the fun ended.  I accept the fact that this is a network television show, and for that reason this show will feature an inordinate number of attractive young actors playing stock characters and that there will be an ethnically diverse cast of characters that somehow feels ""forced"" (Handsome young male lead?  Check.  Add a few impossibly beautiful young women?  Check.  Black guy?  Check.  Asian characters?  Check.  Chubby comic relief?  Check.  Dangerous rebel?  Check.  ....You get the point).  If it seems like the network had a checklist for the stock characters and ethnicities they wanted represented so as to widen the show's appeal, well it did.  That's how network TV works.  That's how network execs think.Next ingredient:  make it eerie but not too complicated.  Don't make it cerebral, but make it LOOK and FEEL like it is cerebral.Make the post-plane crash behavior as unrealistic as possible.  The survivors are at first without a decent supply of food, water, shelter, adequate medical care, etc, but they go about their business like calm sheep, only pausing to stare in wonder whenever they hear a strange animal growl or trees moving.  Even then, they only react when the camera pans to them.  It's kind of a ""rolling acknowledgement"" - each one of them on the beach hears the sounds at the same time, but their reactions are in ""staggered time"".  Apparently it is important on a television drama for the camera to capture the startled reactions of each and every character, no matter how much time it takes, whenever something startling occurs.  It looks so hokey and cliche and REHEARSED that you'd swear Steven Spielberg himself had shot it.By the way, the plane wreckage and debris looked totally unrealistic.  It looked like the debris was simply placed on the beach.  I didn't see any tell-tale signs of a large object having a violent crash landing and/or coming to a stop.  A plane crash (even just a downed fuselage and two engines) leaves a HECK of a lot more physical damage to the surrounding area than what we see in ""Lost"".  But that would be expensive to design and would spoil the beauty of the scenery.Maybe I'm nitpicking.  Maybe my expectations are too high.  But details and verisimilitude are important.  If the network wants me to invest a significant amount of time in that show, then they should invest more time and effort into paying attention to details.  A cool premise will carry a show only so far.  The premise and plot don't have to be absolutely realistic, but the everyday elements of the natural world (Laws of Physics, patterns of human behavior in desperate situations, etc) should be grounded in reality, even within the context of a fantasy show.  Otherwise, this might as well be ""Gilligan's Island"" or a Saturday morning cartoon. I said that already, but it bears repeating.By the way, at the beginning of the pilot episode where Matthew Fox's character ""Jack"" awakens in a field of tall grass that completely surrounds him, how did he know which way to run?  How did the dog get out of the carrier he was presumably in?  Isn't it convenient that their luggage arrived with them and intact when the rest of the plane was essentially blown to bits?  How come a grown man got sucked into the engine but nothing else nearby of considerably lighter weight even rustled in the suction breeze?  And why does J.J. Abrams seem to think that using one of the most overused cliches in drama (having a young pregnant woman go into labor or have labor pains at the most inopportune moment) does NOT look downright silly?  He did it here, and he did it again in his ""Star Trek"" movie.  It's old and tired and it should be beneath him.  But apparently it's not.  Maybe the pregnancy has a dramatic payoff later in the season, maybe it doesn't.  That's not the point.  The point is that it is an overused cliche and stock character to suffer through while we're waiting to see IF there is a payoff. Maybe some of these questions get addressed YEARS later in future seasons, but those are bad elements to hinge a plot line on.  It's like asking someone to listen to a singer's 11 terrible CD's because the last track on the 12th one is supposed to be good enough to make up for the rest.I just don't get it.  I don't see how so many people are so enamored of this show.  It is a cool premise executed in the laziest way imaginable.If ""Lost"" was the first and only dramatic series I'd ever seen, I'd probably think it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.  But the bar has been set very high recently by shows like ""The Wire"", for example, and now any other show that doesn't even attempt to match it for quality just looks all the worse for not trying.  Not that ""Lost"" and ""The Wire"" are the same type of show.  That's for damn sure.  But ""The Wire"" has shown how great episodic drama can be.  It is character-driven, not gimmick-driven.  ""Lost"" is, first and foremost, gimmick-driven.  Americans love ""gimmick TV"".  No surprise that this show has become successful.  Even the fans who complain that the show moves too slowly and that nothing really ever happens still rave about the show as if it were the best thing ever on TV.  They give it an unconditional pass.  That's too bad.I somehow made it almost all the way through Season One of this show.  I was hoping to enjoy it, but I just couldn't see past all the weaknesses and laziness in the directing, writing, logic, and production design.  This show was a soap opera gone ""high-concept"", that's all.  When a soap opera aspires to be greater than it is, when it tries to reach the heights of great drama or a great thriller, it usually just comes off looking silly.  That's ""Lost"" in a nutshell.I have no desire to see any future seasons and I can't recommend this show to any of my friends who insist on a minimum standard of literary or narrative excellence.  This show has often been compared to ""Lord of the Flies"".  Hardly.  ""LOTF"" explored man's dark and primitive nature.  ""Lost"" is too superficial to tackle that theme with any seriousness.The show is abysmally bad.Did you know that the idea for this show was dreamed up by a network exec at ABC?  He thought the premise would make for a cool series, so he hired various folks to write it for him.  The series was greenlit on the basis of the concept alone.  Too bad the so-called ""creative talent"" behind the show couldn't make it work any better than they did.This show was about as big a mistake as a trouble married couple deciding to have a baby to ""save their marriage"".The ONLY thing Season 1 is good for is as a drinking game.  Every time you see a scene where someone in either the foreground or background is folding clothes from a piece of luggage, drink a shot.  Actually, it might even help you enjoy the show more.  I'd probably have to be drunk to watch more of this crapfest anyway.This show in some ways disappoints me the same way the Star Wars prequel ""The Phantom Menace"" did.  As in ""Phantom Menace"", ""Lost"" doesn't have nearly enough plot to sustain its running time.  As a result, the show's flaws take center stage when there is nothing else interesting going on on-screen.  Watching this show, you can never forget you are listening to scripted dialogue.  There is almost nothing natural about their conversations.  Every word sounds like it is being spoken for dramatic effect.....  You know what?  It makes my head hurt to even discuss this show.  I'm still not sure if I genuinely hate the show or if I merely resent the writers and directors for being so lazy and for paying so little attention to the small moments.  This show is FULL of small moments.  When they are weak and silly, it paints the whole show with that brush.This show might have worked better as a 2-hour TV movie.  It would have been narratively tighter and more effective, maybe like one of the better ""Twilight Zone"" episodes.  But it is stretched too thin and can't sustain itself on a moment-to-moment basis without resorting to trying to squeeze a high amount dramatic tension from very minor events.  It just looks silly.  What a waste of a good premise.Funny thing is, this first season won an Emmy for Best Dramatic Series and then in subsequent seasons was criticized for being slow and boring.  I thought Season One was about as slow and boring as a show could get.  I can't really imagine how unbearable the subsequent seasons must have been.Like anyone else, I've been either disinterested in or disappointed by any number of shows over the years.

632955,A2ELNC5ZW7D1P3,B00005JNOG,---- John T. Jameson,"[6, 7]","I am a fan of shows on TV that try and expand our idea of what you can do on television. Basically if a show feels like it could be a movie as well, then I am interested. 'Lost' is such a show. Every episode feels like a mini movie and when put together it feels like an epic story covering the diversity of the human experience in all it complexity. At the center of this show is the horror of a plane crash on a seemingly deserted island in the south pacific. 47 passengers are left to fend for themselves and soon discover that the island may not be as peaceful as it appears. But really that is only half the story because each episode also gives the audience the chance to learn more about a given character, so that each hour feels like its own story. Those main characters include: Jack (Matthew Fox) a doctor and the chosen leader of their band, Kate (Evangeline Lily) a quiet woman with a tortured and hidden past, Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) a fading, drug addicted rock star, Michael and his estranged son Walt, Sawyer a con-man with an attitude, and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) the man with the secret... just to name a few. What makes this show special is both the style it uses, the time on the island is combined with flashbacks of a given character as it effects their choices in the community, and its substance, each person is dealing with their own inner demons and mysteries. The characters are both believable and involving in such a way that as their stories evolve we are both shocked and moved as we learn the truth about who they all really are. I cannot reccomend this show enough. It can be funny, tragic, horrifying and astounding all at the same time. I guarantee that if you watch the first disc in this set to completion you will be there to the end, it's that good. Highlights for me include the 2 part pilot, the 3rd episode Walkabout, episode 8-Confidence Man, episode 9-Solitary, episode 16-Outlaws, and of course the 2 part season finale Exodus.",5,The Best TV Show I Have Ever Seen,1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,1974,"['am', 'fan', 'shows', 'TV', 'try', 'expand', 'idea', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'television', 'Basically', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'am', 'interested', 'show', 'episode', 'feels', 'mini', 'movie', 'when', 'put', 'together', 'epic', 'story', 'covering', 'diversity', 'human', 'experience', 'complexity', 'center', 'show', 'horror', 'plane', 'crash', 'seemingly', 'deserted', 'island', 'south', 'pacific', '47', 'passengers', 'are', 'left', 'fend', 'soon', 'discover', 'island', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'peaceful', 'really', 'only', 'story', 'episode', 'also', 'audience', 'chance', 'learn', 'more', 'given', 'character', 'hour', 'feels', 'own', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'include', 'Jack', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'doctor', 'chosen', 'leader', 'band', 'Kate', 'Evangeline', 'Lily', 'quiet', 'woman', 'tortured', 'hidden', 'past', 'Charlie', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'fading', 'drug', 'addicted', 'rock', 'star', 'Michael', 'estranged', 'son', 'Walt', 'Sawyer', 'con-man', 'attitude', 'Locke', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'man', 'secret', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'What', 'show', 'special', 'style', 'time', 'island', 'combined', 'flashbacks', 'given', 'character', 'effects', 'choices', 'community', 'substance', 'person', 'dealing', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'mysteries', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'involving', 'such', 'way', 'stories', 'are', 'shocked', 'moved', 'learn', 'truth', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'can', 'not', 'reccomend', 'show', 'enough', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'tragic', 'horrifying', 'astounding', 'same', 'time', 'guarantee', 'watch', 'first', 'disc', 'set', 'completion', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'end', 'good', 'Highlights', 'include', '2', 'part', 'pilot', '3rd', 'episode', 'Walkabout', 'episode', '8-Confidence', 'Man', 'episode', '9-Solitary', 'episode', '16-Outlaws', 'course', '2', 'part', 'season', 'finale', 'Exodus']",Lost - The Complete First Season

But after watching the pilot, I was glued to my couch.  The mysterious island kept me wanting more and more.  All the characters are played wonderfully.  Most noted ones Jack, Sawyer, Locke, and Kate.  I thought the reality shows were killing the network drama shows.  But after watching the first season of this show I knew it would never die.  I am not going to going to tell what happens, everyone knows about this show.  Once you watch it you will want more and more, very addictive show.

632957,A116TUHKGCCY2O,B00005JNOG,Jonathan Martin,"[6, 7]","I bought this dvd months after it was released, never having watched a single episode. I kept hearing about it on tv and seen all the awards the show recieved so i took a chance and bought it. Best decision i have made. This show has the best writers, directors, and actors out there. But what really keeps you watching are the mysteries and questions each episode raises. You just wanna know how? why? when? what? where? and you have to keep watching to find out. I have literally made atleast 10 of my friends who have never heard of the show watch it with me, and every one of them is a fan now. Most people think ok a plane crashes and there are people stuck on an island. I heard this before. But not the case with LOST. The island is very mysterious, and the characters are as well. Flashbacks in the lives of the survivors give you insight on why they are who they are. Can you really trust each other, or are people just looking out for themselves? Some will kill to get back home but some would not mind just staying where they are. It's a very entertaining show and some of the things that happen on here are shocking. Once you watch you wont be able to stop. Season two is just as good, with quite a few surprises and shocking moments. It will be out on September 5th, i can't wait.

632958,A30NEB69DC1RSP,B00005JNOG,"Joseph Devon ""Author of Probability Angels""","[1, 1]","I'm a little torn on my rating. I know it sounds stupid to give something a 5-Star rating and then mention that you're not sure it's earned it but...well this is Lost and weird things are allowed to happen in its review.The fact is that I began to view Lost as two different shows.  One in which the survivors of a plane crash struggle to maintain their existence on a jungle island amidst some, frankly, bizarre stuff.  Polar bears attack, smokey blurry monsters obliterate trees and the occasional person and an insane french woman does...well she does insane things.  And I enjoyed that side of things.On the other side of things we delve, via flashbacks, into the lives of all the main characters, slowly fleshing out who they are and how they wound up on the plane to begin with and what their demons are.  That side of things I found to be utterly exceptional television.  I can't, off the top of my head, think of a single back story that I didn't enjoy.  Some were sad, some were funny, some were heartbreaking, but all of it was great television.So, how do I reconcile one half of a show which I enjoyed and the other half of a show I found exceptional and wind up still being torn on my review?  Because while the back stories all came together enough to round out the season, the weird island storyline ended in an unbelievably excruciating cliffhanger that really seemed a bit too much for me and resolved absolutely nothing. I'm watching the show on DVD and will have the next season in my hands shortly, but holy cow if I had been watching live I think I might have lost it and not been so appreciative of the teasing nature of the season finale.I'm all for surprise twists and cliffhangers but this one seemed downright cruel.So it gets five stars, and I'm very much looking forward to Season 2.  I guess I just feel a little bad for those people who started watching this show live way back when and had to wait an entire summer for the new season.",5,Despite the 5-Stars I'm a little torn,1236297600,"03 6, 2009",2009,1964,"[""'m"", 'little', 'torn', 'rating', 'know', 'stupid', 'give', 'something', '5-Star', 'rating', 'then', 'mention', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'earned', 'well', 'Lost', 'weird', 'things', 'are', 'allowed', 'happen', 'review.The', 'fact', 'began', 'view', 'Lost', 'two', 'different', 'shows', 'One', 'survivors', 'plane', 'crash', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'existence', 'jungle', 'island', 'frankly', 'bizarre', 'stuff', 'Polar', 'bears', 'attack', 'smokey', 'blurry', 'monsters', 'obliterate', 'trees', 'occasional', 'person', 'insane', 'french', 'woman', 'well', 'insane', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'side', 'things.On', 'other', 'side', 'things', 'delve', 'flashbacks', 'lives', 'main', 'characters', 'slowly', 'fleshing', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'wound', 'up', 'plane', 'begin', 'what', 'demons', 'are', 'side', 'things', 'found', 'be', 'utterly', 'exceptional', 'television', 'ca', ""n't"", 'top', 'head', 'think', 'single', 'back', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'were', 'sad', 'were', 'funny', 'were', 'heartbreaking', 'was', 'great', 'television.So', 'how', 'do', 'reconcile', 'one', 'half', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'half', 'show', 'found', 'exceptional', 'wind', 'up', 'still', 'being', 'torn', 'review', 'back', 'stories', 'came', 'together', 'enough', 'round', 'out', 'season', 'weird', 'island', 'storyline', 'ended', 'unbelievably', 'excruciating', 'cliffhanger', 'really', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'resolved', 'absolutely', 'nothing', ""'m"", 'watching', 'show', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'next', 'season', 'hands', 'shortly', 'holy', 'cow', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'live', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'lost', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'appreciative', 'teasing', 'nature', 'season', 'finale.I', ""'m"", 'surprise', 'twists', 'cliffhangers', 'one', 'seemed', 'downright', 'cruel.So', 'five', 'stars', ""'m"", 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'Season', '2', 'guess', 'just', 'feel', 'little', 'bad', 'people', 'who', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'live', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'had', 'wait', 'entire', 'summer', 'new', 'season']",Lost - The Complete First Season
632959,ANRD10YW616JL,B00005JNOG,Joseph Guyer,"[24, 26]","Lost is incredible. It is by far the most intellectual show on television, and like the Simpsons, it appeals to low-brow and high-brow tastes. Some viewers may watch it purely for the adventure and supernatural element (it's Jurassic Park and the Shining and Robinson Crusoe---together at last). Others may watch it for the richly nuanced characters (what other show has a regular character who speaks only Korean?). And others still may watch it for the philosophical undercurrent.What's great about the philosophy is that the writers present it without pretentiousness. Most of it is subtle. The most philosophical character is, of course, John Locke, who happens to share his name with the great seventeenth-century English philosopher (who had some interesting things to say about the behavior of humans in the State of Nature). Also on the show is a mysterious and ambiguous French female character named Rousseau, who also happens to share her name with the great eighteenth-century French philosopher (who also had some interesting things to say about the behavior of humans in the State of Nature).Lost is very existential. The main themes of the show, expressed a few times by Locke, are the inevitability of fate and the opportunity to change oneself for the better. These 47 (and dwindling) survivors are given the rare chance to focus on their lives, question their past mistakes, and become better people. And these characters have a lot to think about. One character is a drug addict; one was a torurer for Saddam Hussein; one was a hitman; one had an (arguably) incestuous relationship with her step-brother; two are murderers. Only Jack, the doctor, seems to have a sense of morality and decency, but this could easily change with a surprising flashback (for being the main protagonist, we know little about Jack's past).When I first started watching the show, I thought it was too much like William Golding's Lord of the Flies. The characters are in the same survival situation; the island serves as a convenient microcosm of the Earth (especially since there's practically one of every ethnic group, except American Indian); there are wild boars; the survivors have established separate bands. Even Sawyer, one of the aforementioned murderers, says in an episode, ""It's Lord of the Flies time!""But since I've been watching the show more and more, I care less and less how much it resembles Golding's classic novel. You won't find a better, more engrossing and intellectually stimulating drama on television on any network today.",5,The most philosophical show on television,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,2546,"['Lost', 'incredible', 'far', 'most', 'intellectual', 'show', 'television', 'Simpsons', 'appeals', 'low-brow', 'high-brow', 'tastes', 'viewers', 'may', 'watch', 'purely', 'adventure', 'supernatural', 'element', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Shining', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', '-together', 'last', 'Others', 'may', 'watch', 'richly', 'nuanced', 'characters', 'what', 'other', 'show', 'regular', 'character', 'who', 'only', 'Korean', 'others', 'still', 'may', 'watch', 'philosophical', 'undercurrent.What', 'great', 'philosophy', 'writers', 'present', 'pretentiousness', 'Most', 'subtle', 'most', 'philosophical', 'character', 'course', 'John', 'Locke', 'who', 'share', 'name', 'great', 'seventeenth-century', 'English', 'philosopher', 'who', 'had', 'interesting', 'things', 'say', 'behavior', 'humans', 'State', 'Nature', 'Also', 'show', 'mysterious', 'ambiguous', 'French', 'female', 'character', 'named', 'Rousseau', 'who', 'also', 'share', 'name', 'great', 'eighteenth-century', 'French', 'philosopher', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'interesting', 'things', 'say', 'behavior', 'humans', 'State', 'Nature', '.Lost', 'very', 'existential', 'main', 'themes', 'show', 'expressed', 'few', 'times', 'Locke', 'are', 'inevitability', 'fate', 'opportunity', 'change', 'better', '47', 'dwindling', 'survivors', 'are', 'given', 'rare', 'chance', 'focus', 'lives', 'question', 'past', 'mistakes', 'become', 'better', 'people', 'characters', 'have', 'lot', 'think', 'One', 'character', 'drug', 'addict', 'one', 'was', 'torurer', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'one', 'was', 'hitman', 'one', 'had', 'arguably', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'step-brother', 'two', 'are', 'murderers', 'Only', 'Jack', 'doctor', 'have', 'sense', 'morality', 'decency', 'could', 'easily', 'change', 'surprising', 'flashback', 'being', 'main', 'protagonist', 'know', 'little', 'Jack', 'past', '.When', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'William', 'Golding', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'characters', 'are', 'same', 'survival', 'situation', 'island', 'convenient', 'microcosm', 'Earth', 'especially', 'practically', 'one', 'ethnic', 'group', 'American', 'Indian', 'are', 'wild', 'boars', 'survivors', 'have', 'established', 'separate', 'bands', 'Even', 'Sawyer', 'one', 'aforementioned', 'murderers', 'episode', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'time', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'more', 'more', 'care', 'less', 'less', 'how', 'much', 'Golding', 'classic', 'novel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'better', 'more', 'engrossing', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'drama', 'television', 'network', 'today']",Lost - The Complete First Season

This format really shows itself as being a better story vehicle than film when done so right like season 1 of Lost was. The character development and slow revealing of the mystery, especially each and every character's mysterious history is very rewarding and always surprising. The production is better than many films and the writing is excellent. All of the characters can be liked or disliked depending on the way they deal with a situation and this makes them more like real people instead of the typical 2 Dimensional television character. The attention to detail is fantastic. In the pilot, Jack runs into Kate for the first time as she emerges from the jungle rubbing her wrists. A few episodes later you see why. The thing is, is that you don't really notice she's rubbing her wrists until you've already seen it and you already know why she's doing it. The writers really planned ahead. The show is full of these little hints and details that it's almost impossible to keep up with. Lost really is a high watermark for television and being on at the same time as Battlestar Galactica and The Shield is simply awesome.

632962,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B00005JNOG,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[3, 5]","Long before their Oceanic flight crashed on a remote island, the crash survivors all had something in common, yet they, nor the television viewer at home, knew just how they were connected, and even now, a season and a half later, the mystery still remains.What is no longer a mystery however, is whether or not this show, a ""scripted Survivor"" if you will, would suceed. That question, unlike many of the queries on the show itself, has been answered with a resounding yes.Lost enjoyed a phenomenal first season, teaming with Desperate Housewives to bring ABC roaring back to primetime success. The fantastic cast and incredible story lines, along with the fantastic writers and producers, helped bring about that success and viewers everywhere are hooked on the story of the crash survivors and just what the island holds for them. This DVD set certainly raises the bar for television DVD sets, with a fantastic release loaded with great extras.The group of survivors is certainly an eclectic group. There's the reluctant hero doctor (Matthew Fox) who finds himself torn between different groups of survivors, all desperate for a leader. There's the strong, beautiful Kate (Evangeline Lilly) who we learn is a fugitive from justice, who was on the plane with a US Marshal. There's the brash, cocky Sawyer (Josh Holloway), who competes with Jack for Kate's affections and also has some dark secrets of his own. There's the Korean couple Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) and Sun (Yunjin Kim) who as the show starts, are isolated by the rest of the survivors because they only speak Korean. There's the pregnant Claire (Emilie de Ravin). There's the drug addicted rock star Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), desperate for a fix. There's Michael (Harold Perrineau) and his son young Michael (Malcolm David Kelly) who have spent very little time together in the past. There's brother and sister (okay step brother and step sister) Boone (Ian Somerholder) and Shannon (Maggie Grace) who share a very dark secret, one that I imagine nobody saw coming. There's Hurley (Jorge Garcia) the millionaire (though nobody knows it) who builds a golf course on the island. There's Sayid, the Iraqi soldier and torture expert. And of course, there's Locke (Terry O'Quinn), the hunter, the one who provides everyone with food, but who also provides everyone with a number of problems too.When the show began, you had to wonder just how it would sustain, how would following survivors of a plane crash keep a show on the air for a year? But, the writers and producers had the great idea of flashbacks, where viewers get to look into the past of the castaways, see what helped them become who they are, see the reasons they got on the plane, see who they were before they were survivors. This tool is absolutely fantastic. Some of the backstories are amazing and reveal some incredible secrets, which I won't reveal here to avoid spoilers. Every major character has at least one backstory with several getting a couple. Locke's first backstory is one of the best, and certainly one of the most surprising.The island itself is also a character on the show, quite possibly the most intriguing character. What it holds nobody knows, but the survivors do know that there is some sort of monster that terrorizes them. Sawyer shoots a polar bear (yes a polar bear in the jungle). There is a strange transmission from a French woman that Sayid picks up on a radio from the plane. Of course the transmission has been looping for 16 years. We also get to meet the French woman, Danielle Rousseau, and learn her story.A number of survivors follow Jack to the caves to be near fresh water, while others remain on the beach with hope of being seen by a passing ship. Claire and Charlie are kidnapped by ""The Others,"" people who were already on the island when the plane crashed. Though the two both return, Charlie shoots the captor before the rest of the group can get information from him. Locke and Boone find a hatch buried in the ground, which eventually leads to Boone being severly injured when a prop plane falls from the treetops with him in it. The hatch has numbers emblazoned on the side, numbers that Hurley used to win the lottery and numbers that he believes are cursed.All told, things are pretty strange and when season two started, they got even stranger.It is obvious from this DVD set that the producers of the show had a DVD set in mind when they made the show, because the amount of extras on the set are amazing. There are interviews with cast members, audition scenes, unaired scenes, a gag reel and a number of commentaries, just to name a few. These extras provide some great insight into the show and to someone who is addicted to the story, these extras were certainly very welcome.Without a question, this is one of the top DVD television sets of the year. The quality of the production is amazing and the show is one of a kind. This set comes highly recommended for those who love the show and particularly for those who want the chance to find out what the hype is all about.",5,Guys . . .

In fact, I haven't done this since I was a child. I remember counting the minutes until the next show on ""The fall guy"", ""CHiPs"" or ""Automan"" began. After I grew up and time seemed scarse each year, I simply lost my interest for such series (although I rented the ""Simpsons"" seasons a while ago).And then, ""Lost"" came. As I was zapping through channels, AXN's short preview caught my attention. Being a fan of ""Lord of flies"", ""And then there were none"" and other such stories where a bunch of previously unacquainted people have to live together in a remote place, making life possible with what they have at hand, I decided that I would give this new series a try.From the first scenes of the plane crash, to the choice of the characters, the beautiful locations and the unusual things happening along the island (a polar bear in a tropical place!) I was hooked. I not only watched this first season in its entirety, but browsed through the net wanting to know more about everything related to the series.The writing is great, the episode structure is intelligent, mixing what is happening on the island (new discoveries, smoking monsters, antique planes crashed full of heroine, the ""Others"") to the tales of the lives of the characters previously to the plane crash. What were the reasons for each one of them to be in Sidney traveling to Los Angeles at that moment of their lives? How are they related to each other (because, in a way or another, they are)? The obvious attention production spends with every detail is also remarkable. Add to all that Evengeline Lilly and the show is almost perfect. Of course, there may be lots of inconsistencies, plot-holes and other absurdities in the series, but this time I'm not looking for them, I'm just watching each episode like I was a kid again, and having lots of fun.My only fear is a stalling in the development of the story. But in the first season it did not happen, as the variety of the characters and their relations proved to be a good source of plots to the series. Hope that the second season is as good as this first one.

When I read the write up about it by accident, I decided to watch it. It is astonishing. Usually I can't sit still for one little movie, but I am sitting through this watching nearly an entire season in two days. That is 24 episodes! When I think I really should get back to work or do something besides sitting in front of the t.v., I watch another episode which leaves a cliffhanger and I have to watch it.There's a lot of mystery and usually 2 or 3 plots are going at the same time. The actors may have been rather unknown before this show but I bet they are known now. I know I have looked every one of them up. There's also a lot of supernatural events which keep you enthralled. And the question of whether this group ended up together due to fate or coincidence is always there.You have to watch the show carefully because when they show flashbacks from these people's lives, you will see someone else from the island in nearly every one of them. They may have just been a casual passerby in the background but usually someone is always in someone else's flashback, even though the one having the flashback never really notices them. It's odd and makes you start wondering why. Also the flashbacks lets them bring in guest stars that they wouldn't be able to do if they just did island scenes. You'll see some surprising guest stars...like Peg  from Married with Children to name just one.It appears most of these people were ""bad"" people with little redeeming features, some were murderers or killed someone by accident, or some other misfit of society. But they are now saving other's lives and appear entirely human. You start wondering if they are part of some experiment, why some of the ones who appear to be ""good"" get killed off of if they are all just dreaming. The show keeps coming up with a plot that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat.I am so glad now that I didn't watch these on t.v. from the beginning because I would never have been able to wait week by week to see what happened next.

632967,A10872FHIJAKKD,B00005JNOG,Just Bill,"[6, 7]","My wife and I held out and didn't buy Lost for a month or two after the release of the DVD set. We thought, ""A new TV show that's actually good? Right.""Then one day we had a gift certificate for a local book store and we took a chance on it.Holy cow, Lost is brilliant. The cinematography is stunning. The writing is crisp and believable. The characters are memorable and endearing. We had no idea today's TV shows could be this good.It's hard to explain what Lost is all about because there's a slight sci-fi/fantasy element involved. (The island has some strange -- and even invisible -- characters on it. And at least one character -- Terry O'Quinn's Locke -- thinks the island is ""alive"" somehow and is responsible for bringing all of them to itself.)If you're looking for character- AND plot-driven television at its finest, Lost is for you. This DVD set is worth every dime. Do yourself a favor and buy it.(Incidentally, we were spoiled watching Lost on DVD. When we tried to watch it on television we couldn't do it. The commercials severely interrupted the flow of the story. So we download the individual episodes from iTunes and watch them on our computer. Until Season Two is released, that's how we're getting our Lost fix for now.)",5,Five stars are not enough for this brilliant series!,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,1244,"['wife', 'held', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Lost', 'month', 'two', 'release', 'DVD', 'set', 'thought', 'new', 'TV', 'show', 'actually', 'good', 'Right', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'had', 'gift', 'certificate', 'local', 'book', 'store', 'took', 'chance', 'it.Holy', 'cow', 'Lost', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'writing', 'crisp', 'believable', 'characters', 'are', 'memorable', 'endearing', 'had', 'idea', 'today', 'TV', 'shows', 'could', 'be', 'good.It', 'hard', 'explain', 'what', 'Lost', 'about', 'slight', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'element', 'involved', 'island', 'strange', 'even', 'invisible', 'characters', 'least', 'one', 'character', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Locke', 'island', 'alive', 'somehow', 'responsible', 'bringing', ""'re"", 'looking', 'character-', 'AND', 'plot-driven', 'television', 'finest', 'Lost', 'DVD', 'set', 'worth', 'dime', 'Do', 'favor', 'buy', 'Incidentally', 'were', 'spoiled', 'watching', 'Lost', 'DVD', 'When', 'tried', 'watch', 'television', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'commercials', 'severely', 'interrupted', 'flow', 'story', 'download', 'individual', 'episodes', 'iTunes', 'watch', 'computer', 'Season', 'Two', 'released', 'how', ""'re"", 'getting', 'Lost', 'fix', 'now']",Lost - The Complete First Season

632969,A16RD1QP46KLDH,B00005JNOG,"Karl G ""Jerry""","[1, 1]","Lost is a very good drama serial. 48 passengers crash land on a deserted island, 1000 miles off course. Of these 48, the show focuses on 14, making it very easy to remember the main chracters. Each person has a past before he or she boarded the plane. They were all strangers when they landed - soon they become friends (or enemies). Combining the elements of past and future, the effect is one that is captivating and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Also, a person might think because they are on an island, there should not be any guest stars. That's wrong, for guest stars pop out in the roles of mysterious French women, mysterious men and some others of the 48 passengers. The thriller is very exciting, by developing each charcter's relationship with each other well.What I am quite unsatisfied with is the presence of the beast, a creature that lives in the jungles. We have seen every beast possible in every movie shown. Unless the beast really is a three-headed dog with a big appetite, it would not be new. Oh wait. Three-headed dog appeared in Harry Potter.Other than that, the show is beautifully-written and masterfully-directed by J.J Abrams, creator of Alias. The concept is original and the reason that it doesn't become Lord of The Flies-based is due to the fact that there are little flashbacks of certain charcters every episode, to remind us they were civilised before they landed into this mess.Overall, I would give it 4 stars, and would recommend this DVD. Unless you're the kind of person who would wonder how 48 people survived a plane crash, how come there's a rampaging monster which probably doesn't exist in real life, and how a paralysed man would recover after that crash, you would thoroughly enjoy the show and all its major fictional proportions.",4,Lost in great TV,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,1785,"['Lost', 'very', 'good', 'drama', 'serial', '48', 'passengers', 'crash', 'land', 'deserted', 'island', '1000', 'miles', 'course', '48', 'show', '14', 'making', 'very', 'easy', 'remember', 'main', 'chracters', 'person', 'past', 'boarded', 'plane', 'were', 'strangers', 'when', 'landed', 'soon', 'become', 'friends', 'enemies', 'Combining', 'elements', 'past', 'future', 'effect', 'one', 'captivating', 'edge', 'seat', 'Also', 'person', 'might', 'think', 'are', 'island', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'guest', 'stars', 'wrong', 'guest', 'stars', 'pop', 'out', 'roles', 'mysterious', 'French', 'women', 'mysterious', 'men', 'others', '48', 'passengers', 'thriller', 'very', 'exciting', 'developing', 'charcter', 'relationship', 'other', 'well.What', 'am', 'quite', 'unsatisfied', 'presence', 'beast', 'creature', 'jungles', 'have', 'seen', 'beast', 'possible', 'movie', 'shown', 'beast', 'really', 'three-headed', 'dog', 'big', 'appetite', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'new', 'Oh', 'wait', 'Three-headed', 'dog', 'appeared', 'Harry', 'Potter.Other', 'show', 'beautifully-written', 'masterfully-directed', 'J.J', 'Abrams', 'creator', 'Alias', 'concept', 'original', 'reason', ""n't"", 'become', 'Lord', 'Flies-based', 'due', 'fact', 'are', 'little', 'flashbacks', 'certain', 'charcters', 'episode', 'remind', 'were', 'civilised', 'landed', 'mess.Overall', 'would', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'wonder', 'how', '48', 'people', 'survived', 'plane', 'crash', 'how', 'come', 'rampaging', 'monster', 'probably', ""n't"", 'exist', 'real', 'life', 'how', 'paralysed', 'man', 'would', 'recover', 'crash', 'would', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'show', 'major', 'fictional', 'proportions']",Lost - The Complete First Season
632970,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B00005JNOG,- Kasia S.,"[6, 6]","Now that I finally got to experience ""Lost"" for myself I can certainly see what everyone around me is raving about. I didn't watch it when it came out because I'm not really a TV person and following shows is hard for me on weekly basis  so I decided to wait till few season finished to later watch them all in one swoop. For someone who doesn't watch the telly I plowed through this show ferociously and in six days was done with season one.First of all, I simply adore the lost in the woods and deserted island stories, books, films you name it. The drama that unfolds in this series has the same elements that can be found anywhere, rivalry, jealousy, hatred, love, false accusations, hidden secrets and all sorts of emotions take over characters as their time on the island seems to extend into eternity. The cast of characters is very broad but I adore how many main personalities there are because of the myriad of adventures that follow each and the groups they form themselves. One would think that staying calm and friendly would be one way to survive, but hunger, lack of protection from elements and the erratic ways the human behavior can change are no match for what really awaits for them on the island.The island they are stranded on is not your average lush tropical retreat. Not only is the island inhabited by strange creatures and monsters you don't really get to see at first but there is talk of others, dark beings that are either sinister people or something even worse. Best way to watch this is without knowing anything about it so I am not going to divulge any more details, let me just say that there are very few slow moments and most of the time things go from crazy to insane. My favorite characters so far are John Locke played by Terry O'Quinn  and Sayid  played by Naveen Andrews. One never knows if the characters are really pure at heart because there are so many wild twists but man this show rocks, I love it. The moment I finished watching season one I started with season two and few episodes into it I am just as enchanted as I was with the first. The revelations are incredible and the mysteries only seem to grow in size and danger. This is one show that I wish could go on forever, I hope there will be many more seasons to come.- Kasia S.",5,"Lost will make you loose your breath, yes it's that good",1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,2282,"['Now', 'finally', 'got', 'experience', 'Lost', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'what', 'everyone', 'raving', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'when', 'came', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'TV', 'person', 'following', 'shows', 'hard', 'weekly', 'basis', 'decided', 'wait', 'till', 'few', 'season', 'finished', 'later', 'watch', 'one', 'swoop', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'watch', 'telly', 'plowed', 'show', 'ferociously', 'six', 'days', 'was', 'done', 'season', 'one.First', 'simply', 'adore', 'lost', 'woods', 'deserted', 'island', 'stories', 'books', 'films', 'name', 'drama', 'series', 'same', 'elements', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'rivalry', 'jealousy', 'hatred', 'love', 'false', 'accusations', 'hidden', 'secrets', 'sorts', 'emotions', 'take', 'over', 'characters', 'time', 'island', 'extend', 'eternity', 'cast', 'characters', 'very', 'broad', 'adore', 'how', 'many', 'main', 'personalities', 'are', 'myriad', 'adventures', 'follow', 'groups', 'form', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'staying', 'calm', 'friendly', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'way', 'survive', 'hunger', 'lack', 'protection', 'elements', 'erratic', 'ways', 'human', 'behavior', 'can', 'change', 'are', 'match', 'what', 'really', 'island.The', 'island', 'are', 'stranded', 'not', 'average', 'lush', 'tropical', 'retreat', 'Not', 'only', 'island', 'inhabited', 'strange', 'creatures', 'monsters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'see', 'first', 'talk', 'others', 'dark', 'beings', 'are', 'sinister', 'people', 'something', 'even', 'worse', 'Best', 'way', 'watch', 'knowing', 'anything', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'divulge', 'more', 'details', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'slow', 'moments', 'most', 'time', 'things', 'go', 'crazy', 'insane', 'favorite', 'characters', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'John', 'Locke', 'played', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Sayid', 'played', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'One', 'never', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'pure', 'heart', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'wild', 'twists', 'man', 'show', 'love', 'moment', 'finished', 'watching', 'season', 'one', 'started', 'season', 'two', 'few', 'episodes', 'am', 'just', 'as', 'enchanted', 'was', 'first', 'revelations', 'are', 'incredible', 'mysteries', 'only', 'seem', 'grow', 'size', 'danger', 'one', 'show', 'wish', 'could', 'go', 'forever', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'more', 'seasons', 'come.-', 'Kasia', 'S']",Lost - The Complete First Season

That said, I had not watched a single episode of Lost, before I thought I would see what all the hype was about and ordered the set.  What is even more amazing is that I ordered the set in October 2005 and let it sit on my shelves for close to a YEAR (Sept 2006) before I was ""in the mood"" to watch this series.After the first episode, I was absolutely HOOKED.  The cast is superb.  The plane crash was AMAZING and I loved watching how they recreated the scene as we are one of the few ""aircraft boneyards"" that house vintage planes in Tucson.  The L-1011 that they purchased was brought out of the Mohave desert, but just seeing this made me wish they had come to us.  (Or cringe, because if I remember correctly, they did call us - but the L-1011 that we store wasn't for sale as it is owned by a govt. funded agency.)  I would have killed to be involved in the recreation of this in Hawaii.Plane crash aside, the episodes are filled with intrigue and mystery.  There are so many sub-plots going on at once that you just don't get bored and are kept on the edge of your seat.Surprisingly enough, I'm not watching the regular show on tv, but am just going to wait for the DVDs.  I don't think I can take being on the edge of my seat for a whole week while I wait for each episode.  As it was, I saw the first season over the weekend.

I caught on to the show just prior to the start of the Second Season when I ordered the First Season on DVD with the intention of starting a regular viewing of the program.  I got about half way through it, then just stopped watching (other things came up and I just never continued watching).  My wife and oldest daughter are COMPLETELY hooked on the show, and they bought subsequent seasons on DVD; so it's been sitting there, waiting for me all this time.Cut to earlier in the week when I received all 4 Seasons of Lost on Blu Ray as an early Father's Day gift from the family.  I started watching this Season on Thursday Evening, and wrapped it up last night.  The only thing I kept saying to myself was, ""What was I THINKING not watching this?""Absolutely SUPERB picture quality and sound make this a MUST buy.  The beauty of the island is enhanced by the Blu Ray, and as someone already mentioned, the audio makes a lot of use of the rear surround speakers for the ambiance of the island.  The writing is BRILLIANT, and the acting is truly awesome as the layers of each character's past are slowly revealed throughout the series.  Subtle hints of the plot line are sprinkled throughout each episode, making it very much like a puzzle to be pieced together...with some of these hints and plot devices pay off in subsequent episodes, while others remain unresolved (presumably for future Seasons).  NOTHING is what it seems, and even the obvious has hidden meaning. I sat through all five seasons of ""Babylon 5"", and ""Lost"" is similar in the way it takes a plot and turns it back on itself; creating one huge mystery to be solved.  at no time are you ahead of these characters on their journey; you are a PART of the journey itself.""Lost"" will keep you on the edge of your seat with every episode.  It is truly a remarkable piece of television, and Blu Ray is the ultimate medium in which to watch this fantastic program.  The Extras are a great addition and just icing on the cake, allowing you to catch your breath after you've gone through the whole series (at least once).  I cannot recommend the show and these discs highly enough. Surely, this will be repeated viewing for me in the future; and like ""Babylon 5"", I expect I will notice things that were right in front of me that pay off down the line.If you love great writing, acting, and photography along with mind-blowing audio...then these Blu Rays will not disappoint.

632981,ATBADDXLX27EW,B00005JNOG,kidnugget,"[5, 7]","I watched the first season of Lost in summer reruns, and marvelled at JJ Abrams' ability to weave a story of mystery and intrigue.  If you merely think it's ""Castaway on TV,"" you have no idea the delight that awaits you.The show has a rich ensemble cast with fantastic chemistry.  Characters love and hate each other exactly as much as they should, and the constant flashbacks to life before the crash are subtle and surprising enough to constantly redifine your perceptions of them all.  (Much like his show, Alias, Abrams succeeds in redifining the characters and plot line of the show with plenty of artful and shocking twists).  The island itself is the grandest character, however, and with strange shadowy monsters, hidden weapons, walking dead, strange transmissions, cursed lotto numbers, and a mysterious hatch, there's plenty to keep any viewer interested.If you like action or romance, this show has both of them done to perfection.  I'm a huge fan of Alias, and I thought JJ Abrams first show would be his masterpiece since it is one of the best on TV.  Lost, however, proves Abram's skill (and actually makes me want to watch Mission Impossible 3 which he's set to direct) and perhaps bests Alias.Refreshingly, this show breaks many TV formulas, and in a welcome change, characters you come to love over many episodes are just as likely to die as the ""redshirt"" newbies who pop up from time to time.  I love a show where any character can die, and this one proves that's the case.  When a creature stalks a character, I get nervous now, wondering if he/she will actually make it--that's rare and welcome to mainstream television!The DVD set is a solid one as well.  The packaging is unique and nice, with solid plot summary for each episode.  The extras are awesome on the final disk with great documentaries on the making of the show, how they faked the crash site, some entertaining deleted scenes, and even interesting commentary in an age where commentary is often dull.  Even watching the opening screens for the DVDs is fun with some random variations, and there are plenty of easter eggs (I found two already).The other perk is that if you don't have a DVR, the disks will let you see minor things in the background.  (Scenes like Hurley being put in a cop car on the nightly news in the background of a flashback long before we see any of Hurley's flashbacks are easy to spot and revisit on DVD.)  There is so much embedded in each episode, DVD is the only way to untangle the mystery.The only downside to this set is that it's only the first season!  Don't wait.  Buy lost and watch the new season, so they keep making them, and I can keep watching them.  If you like the mystery and awesome character redefinition Lost, you should rush to Alias next.

I am one who shuns the major networks, but I admit that ""Lost"" is one show I cannot miss.Season One sets the table for the sensational 5 seasons that follow, and it does so in absolutely gripping dramatic fashion.  Season One captures you from the moment Jack, the central character, opens his eyes and finds himself ""lost"" on an island after what should be a fatal plane-crash.  There are about 40-some survivors in all, and season one introduces all the main characters in unique fashion.  Each episode focuses on one central character using flashbacks to illustrate key past moments in the characters life.  The flashbacks reveal the background and personality of the character as well as important (and sometimes mysterious) events which placed him/her on the doomed plane.  As the season progresses one nail-biting episode at a time, one comes to realize the passengers have a more in common than just being random passengers in a plane. And this is but one of the many mysteries to solve on the island of ""Lost"".It is apparent from the first episode that the island they find themselves on somehow has a mysterious ""life-force"" of its own, which impacts each of the characters in turn.  Each episode pushes the plot forward a bit, and we discover there are ""others"" on the island, and they are not friendly to the crash survivors.  What are they doing on the island, what it their purpose in being there?  The mysteries grow as the season progresses, and while partial answers are found, the tantilizing fullness of the mysteries remain unsolved.The writers have created amazingly ""real"" personalities in their main characters, so true to life, each with a complex personal history, each with moral and ethical dilemmas, each with personality faults. And it is these rich characterizations that drive the show forward episode after episode.  The direction is superb, with plots that build with each episode, usually ending in a climactic finish that leaves you literally begging for more.  The episodes are like ""Lays"" potato chips - it is tough to just take one.  I found myself watching several in a sitting - the tension and mystery was too great to stop.You cannot go wrong purchasing a used (or new) copy of ""Lost"", watching all the episodes, and then perhaps reselling it and buying the next season, which trust me, you will do.  ""Lost"" will sink its teeth into you and hold you in a building tension unlike any other series I have ever watched.

The story is really deep and there are a lot of little details in the stories that just add to the mystery, but you didn't realize they were important until after the fact (e.g., the consistent reappearing of Hurley's numbers).

632987,A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ,B00005JNOG,Larry Scantlebury,"[3, 3]","TV is a visual medium. Let's not back away from that. The written word and radio obviously has a different set of criteria. And the acting acumen that these (for the most part) young(er) actors bring to the fore may even be more difficult to present when you consider that they know that their appearances are going to be chopped up by . . . you guessed it, the sponsors. That's the nature of the beast. So say we see an early Jon Voight talking with his friend Lewis (Burt Reynolds) in ""Deliverance."" Voight's a 'woos' and Reynolds is so macho  that he makes you feel uncomfortable. BUT THAT'S THE WAY VOIGHT WILL BE IN 100 MINUTES. He knows it. The Director knows it. He can grow into the part over the course of an hour and a half. The actors on LOST have a lot of moments in the sun but they may be 30 and 40 minutes apart.And these actors look good. They are articulate, know their craft, and the women are sexy and yes, there's a lot of skin. When Jack is out on the makeshift driving range with Kate, she ain't Roseanne Barr; no offense meant. Even Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriquez) who is one tough, nasty person, even when she's busting someone's head or threatening to cap them, she just looks gorgeous.Additionally, the juxtopositioning of the then-current time-line with the past is brilliant. One of the reasons for this is because it reverse telegraphs what went on. Dr. Jack running stairs in one of the early scenes in the 'past' and pausing to commiserate with a stranger . . . whew. And the story of the Kims, Daniel and Yoon, and how they met, just excellent. A love story within the drama. It was like ""The Notebook"" without all the other sacharine.The writing is tight. The episodes are very well crafted. There is an urban legend that the production-management staff didn't count on the success and that while failure wasn't planned on it was considered. Hence the overwhelming success caught everyone especially the writers, off-guard. Here is a problem as I see it. We all have a certain half life we give to TV shows. Much as we love 24, for instance (I think still a 'smidgin' in front of LOST for sheer magnetic, breathless episodes), we know eventually Jack will have done everything possible in any human's imagination. He's been electrocuted, shot, addicted to heroin, and all the women he's slept with have been killed or left him. Time to move on. Ditto The Wire. So where do we go with LOST?One of the comments mentions a hubris with this staff of writers-producers-directors that they're great in the opening rounds but fade after the 8th. At the risk of using too much of a jock analogy, they have no bullpen. We'll have to wait and see. I haven't been bored yet for one episode in I (or II for that matter.)To go back to 24 and The Wire for a moment by analogy. We expect the year to produce one story. We expect the story, that story, to be completed in the 30 weeks alloted time.With LOST, it's a continuum and it will be curious to see where it goes. A lot of comments have been made about the show being Gilligan's Island with an edge. I would submit to you that those women aren't ANYTHING like Ginger and Maryanne. Great stuff for TV and coming at the end of a decade of truly worthless junk on television when we were all about to don the trappinigs of Peter Finch in Network and and say ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore"" and hurl our TV's into the garbage. The recyclable bin, naturally. We're much more environmentally sensitive than Finch's character.But a quick word about Reality TV. Yeah. It's crap and my only hope is that Springer et. al. (the Judges' shows also) produces a thorozine calming effect on that portion of the public that is their audience.

632988,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JNOG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 12]","I thought that ""Lost"" was the best show on television last year, even without this week's validation with the Emmy for Best Dramatic Series.  Creators Jeffrey Lieber (""Tangled""), J.J. Abrams (""Alias""), and Damon Lindelof (""Crossing Jordan"") took an airplane crashing on an island in the middle of south Pacific after taking off from Australia, made it a mystery as well as an adventure series, and throw in weekly flashbacks regarding the characters.  This becomes important because the people are as much of a mystery as the island.  One of the things I love about ""Lost"" is how the revelations of a flashback force you to go back and rethink what is happening.  Learning that Locke (Terry O'Quinn) was a paraplegic before the plane crashed on the island (""Walkabout"") is as important an insight as knowing the epistemological positions of the English philosopher of the same name.  Besides, any given flashback is but one episode in the previous life of a given character, and on this show sooner or later everybody gets a second bite of the apple (as Locke gets in ""Deus Ex Machina"").It is also important that ""Lost"" is a mystery where you really need to pay attention to clues.  In this regard it is like ""Twin Peaks,"" where the clues were all there and they showed you who killed Laura Palmer at the end of the first season but did not tell you, which confounded many viewers who praised the need to pay attention the David Lynch's quirky series.  Fortunately ""Lost"" is not reducible to a single question and even to the extent that ""What is down the hatch?"" is the big question of the summer, we know that it is a transitory issue and that other questions remain to be discovered as well as answered.I also like the fact that it is so easy to forget that Jack (Matthew Fox) and Kate (Evangeline Lilly) are core couple, if not the stars, of the show.  Throw in Sawyer (Josh Holloway) and you have you basic love triangle, only with lots of baggage (and my favorite moment with the trio ends up being when Jack gives Sawyer the gun and Sawyer responds with the story of his meeting with Jack's father in ""Exodus, Part 1"").  My favorite character is Sayid (Naveen Andrews), and between him and Kaysar on ""Big Brother 6"" it has been great to see something on television other than Arabs as terrorists.  Of course everybody loves Hurley (Jorge Garcia), Dominic Monaghan has put the whole hobbit thing behind him with Charlie Pace, it is great to see Harold Perrineau playing a character that can walk as Michael, and at least this time Emilie de Ravin's character Claire Littleton has had a human baby (or HAS she?).Having season one of ""Lost"" out on DVD right before season two starts is great, not only so that those who missed out on the fun the first time around can catch up, but also so that those of us who have been around from the start can go back and try connecting some more of the dots.  Did I not notice that in Part 2 of the ""Pilot"" that there was a polar bar in the comic book that Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) was reading or did I simply forget?  What about the two stones, one black and one white, that they found with the corpses in ""House of the Rising Sun""?  At the top of my wish list is does it matter that all of the magic numbers are those that have been retired by the New York Yankees: 4 (Lou Gehrig), 8 (Bill Dickey and Yogi Berra), 15 (Thruman Munson), 16 (Whitey Ford), 23 (Don Mattingly), and 42 (Jackie Robinson, who did not play for the Yankees but MLB retired his number)?  There are so many questions and clues, and perhaps the greatest testament to this series is that we are not in a hurry to find out and are perfectly content to let them parcel out answers and more clues slowly but surely.  Everyone is in for the long haul this time around and it is absolutely great.For commentary tracks there are a few, but they are decent.  Co-creators J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof, and executive producer Bryan Burk do the pilot episode; Terry O'Quinn, executive producer Jack Bender, and co-executive producer David Fury, show up for ""Walkabout,"" an episode that was nominated for a writing Emmy; Dominic Monaghan, Lindelof and Burk do ""The Moth""; and executive producer Carlton Cuse, supervising producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach, Maggie Grace and Ian Somerhalder do the commentary track for ""Hearts and Minds.""  You have to remind yourself that the actors are not really the characters, so that mabye Jorge Garcia doing commentary for ""Numbers"" or Naveen Andrews for ""Solitary"" would not be as interesting as you would think (and if the writers did the commentary tracks they would have to keep remembering not to give things away).  But then this DVD set is loaded with other extras, so it is hard to complain on that score.Hopefully ""Lost"" will be able to build on its successful first season, although the initial auspices are not good as new people are showing up from the mainland in Hawai'i to fix a show that is not broke.  Hearing that they are retroactively trying to make their changes in the scripts for season two fit what happened last year is not good news.  But think positive thoughts: maybe a polar bear will get them.",5,"""Lost"" gets my vote for the best show on television today",1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,5167,"['thought', 'Lost', 'was', 'best',

632990,AT1GMH2UHYROT,B00005JNOG,Lee DeWald,"[24, 31]","At one point in my life, I had three shows that I looked forward to watching every week.  Three programs that I could lose myself in and escape the real world for a short while.  But then the ""Ninja Turtles"" from the old cartoon fought their final battle in May of 1996, and I had to say good-bye to those pizza-loving party animals.It was all good, though.  I still had my other two favorite shows that I could tune into each week.  But then ""The X-Files"" closed its office in May of 2002, and I had to bid farewell to my favorite agents, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.No worries, however.  Even though the aforementioned programs had ridden off into the TV Land sunset, I still had that one show I could make time for every week.  But then the cast of ""Friends"" took their final sip of Central Perk coffee in May of 2004, and I was forced to part ways with Chandler, Joey, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel, and Ross.And then, for the first time in 17 years, my television screen fell silent.  Well, maybe not completely silent.  I still watched ""Survivor"" every now and then, but I wouldn't call myself a devoted fan of the series - perhaps more of a casual viewer.Then they came.  Previews for a hot new fall show.  Blathering on about a bunch of people stranded on a deserted island after their plane crash-landed.  Something called, simply enough, ""Lost.""  I figured it was ""Survivor"" meets ""Cast Away,"" only without the immunity challenges and a volleyball named Wilson.The show looked interesting enough, so I made plans to watch it after work on Wednesday night.  And, just like with ""Survivor: Australian Outback"" (the only season of ""Survivor"" I became a rabid follower of), I was hooked within the first two minutes and never looked back.  Week after week, month after month, I have sat in the comfort of my home and watched these lost souls battle themselves and each other.  I've seen Jack accept his role as reluctant leader, Kate redeem her past demons and relapse again, Sawyer grow a heart, and Charlie mature over his drug addiction.And I've loved it.  I loved it all.  I have a new favorite show again!My only quibble - and it is a minor one - is the fact that Rose's character was dropped by the writers.  I felt the storyline about her husband still being alive on a different part of the island, which Rose believed so deeply, could have been woven into the threads of the series.  However, this is understandable given that the actress has been involved with other projects so the show hasn't been able to use her.  Hopefully, we will see Rose's character again during the second season.  And, again, this is my only nitpick against a show that has otherwise fired on all cylinders.I cannot wait for this DVD set to come out in September.  I am already counting down the days.Congratulations to the cast and crew of ""Lost.""  Your effort into making such a quality show in all aspects of the word has earned you the right to take the summer off.

Things, however, are not what they seem in the Garden of Eden...Terry O'Quinn, Josh Holloway, Dominic Monaghan, Evangeline Lilly, Naveen Andrews and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, tears, not to mention scares.  Lost does a great job of describing people's personalities, secrets and the problems they face.  It's all about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.The setting, the plot (and subplots), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!In short, Lost is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

632995,A2F4A5AN5LQD1,B00005JNOG,Linda K. Paff,"[2, 4]","Well what can you say about ""Lost""? IT ROCKS!!!!!! It is a weekly hour-long television show on the abc network about a group of people who are stranded on a remote island together (though they know not where!) because their plane crashed on a flight between Sydney, Australia and Los Angeles, California. I agree with another reviewer who said that ""it's all about the characters"". This is the most amazing cast of characters I think I have EVER! seen. EVERYONE!!!! on this island has a very intersting story & background but they are all from different races, religions & walks of life. There is a priest (who shows up in season 2!), a doctor (Jack), a drug-addicted rock star (Charlie), an oriental man and wife (Jin and Sun), an 8 month pregnant single woman (Claire), an older colored woman and her white husband (Rose and Bernard), A CONVICT! (Kate), a CON-ARTIST! (Sawyer), a POLICE OFFICER (Anna Lucia, season 2 again), a HUNTER (Locke), a little boy with special ""abilties"" (Walt) and a former member of the IRAQI ARMY!(Sayeed) Yeah, it's cool as hell! Now many things happen while they are on this island and we soon discover that there are ""OTHERS"" there as well! But who are these ""OTHERS""? And what are they doing there? And why have they kidnapped some of the members of this group? And WHAT!, IF ANYTHING! do the numbers ""4, 8, 15, 16, 23 & 42"" have to do with all of it? Well I really could go on and on but to really see how good this show is you really have to see it for yourself. Believe me, you will be glad that you did!!!!! THIS SHOW ROCKS!!!!!! THINGS TO BE ESPECIALLY AWARE OF: The opening of the ""HATCH"", LOCKE'S background story, HURLEY'S background story (including the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 & 42!!!) and the strange things in the forest that everyone can hear (and even feel!) but noone can SEE! (What could that be???!!!) Well that about sums up my review of ""Lost"" for current non-viewers. My husband and I discovered this show in the midle of the second season so we had to play catch up for a while (watching season 2 on tv and season 1 on discs) but you'll be surprised at how fast that goes and just how truly captivating this story (and this group of people!) really is. 5 BIG BRIGHT & SHINY STARS!

633006,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00005JNOG,Mark Baker,"[3, 6]","On a routine flight from Australia to Los Angeles, an Oceanic Airlines flight crashes.  The survivors find themselves on an uncharted island, miles off course.  If anyone is looking for them, they are looking in the wrong place.If it were a matter of simple surviving, these survivors might have had a chance.  But that's not all there is.  A strange creature kills the pilot.  A group finds a radio signal calling for help that's been going for years.  And this group is not alone on the island.Of course, as the group settles in, they get to know each other, and relationships begin to develop.  Other relationships begin to fall apart in the stress of the situation.  And everybody has a story, which is told to us in flashbacks, complimenting the action on the island.I tuned in for the pilot for many reasons.  Survivors on an island always interest me.  And I'm a big fan of ALIAS, also from one of the creators of this show.  I was hooked from the beginning and couldn't wait to tune in each week to see what was going to happen.  With 14 main characters, some only get a scene or two in some episodes, but we might learn about them in the next episode with a series of flashbacks.Everybody seems to have their favorite characters.  Many people tuned in for Dominic Monaghan, fresh off of LORD OF THE RINGS.  Matthew Fox was also a well-known name before hand.  Personally, I was thrilled to see Daniel Dae Kim, who I've been watching show up on various shows since his days on CRUSADE.  And I've also enjoyed seeing Mira Furlan from BABYLON 5 on another show, even if it's only as a guest star.It seems the more we learn about the characters, the more questions that are asked.Some people find that frustrating.  The season finale leaves us with no answers to the questions we've had all season, and the number of questions have only increased.  Personally, I don't expect all the answers until the show is over, so I'm willing to wait out the ride, hoping that Abrams won't give in to pressure to give us answers like he did in ALIAS.  I also hope we get answers before the show ends and it's not dragged out needlessly.So, is the set worth it for fans of the show?  Absolutely!  The show is presented in wide screen, which was what it was shot for.  The surround sound is incredible.  You can hear the bugs in the jungle or the waves on the shore.  Yet the sound effects aren't overwhelming.  They're just right to make you feel like you're there.  There are five commentary tracks with various members of the cast and crew.  And the seventh disc is nothing but bonus material, with documentaries on the creation of the series, casting (with interesting casting videos, sometimes of an actor auditioning for another roll), and creating the pilot.  For fun, there's information on Driveshaft and bloopers.  Plus nineteen minutes of deleted scenes.  The set itself looks nice, but the way the discs are set in the case makes three of them hard to get out.  You have to move out the one in front to get to the one behind.  It's not a big issue, but it is annoying.This shows combines an intriguing story with interesting characters and great writing and acting.  I can't wait until season 2 starts.",5,You'll Get Lost in this Series,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,3205,"['routine', 'flight', 'Australia', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Oceanic', 'Airlines', 'flight', 'crashes', 'survivors', 'find', 'uncharted', 'island', 'miles', 'off', 'course', 'anyone', 'looking', 'are', 'looking', 'wrong', 'place.If', 'were', 'matter', 'simple', 'surviving', 'survivors', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'not', 'strange', 'creature', 'pilot', 'group', 'radio', 'signal', 'calling', 'help', 'been', 'going', 'years', 'group', 'not', 'alone', 'island.Of', 'course', 'group', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'relationships', 'begin', 'develop', 'Other', 'relationships', 'begin', 'fall', 'apart', 'stress', 'situation', 'everybody', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'complimenting', 'action', 'island.I', 'tuned', 'pilot', 'many', 'reasons', 'Survivors', 'island', 'always', 'interest', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'ALIAS', 'also', 'one', 'creators', 'show', 'was', 'hooked', 'beginning', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'tune', 'week', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', '14', 'main', 'characters', 'only', 'get', 'scene', 'two', 'episodes', 'might', 'learn', 'next', 'episode', 'series', 'flashbacks.Everybody', 'have', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Many', 'people', 'tuned', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'fresh', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'was', 'also', 'well-known', 'name', 'hand', 'Personally', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'up', 'various', 'shows', 'days', 'CRUSADE', ""'ve"", 'also', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Mira', 'Furlan', 'BABYLON', '5', 'show', 'even', 'only', 'guest', 'star.It', 'more', 'learn', 'characters', 'more', 'questions', 'are', 'asked.Some', 'people', 'find', 'frustrating', 'season', 'finale', 'answers', 'questions', ""'ve"", 'had', 'season', 'number', 'questions', 'have', 'only', 'increased', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'answers', 'show', 'over', ""'m"", 'willing', 'wait', 'out', 'ride', 'hoping', 'Abrams', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'pressure', 'give', 'answers', 'did', 'ALIAS', 'also', 'hope', 'get', 'answers', 'show', 'not', 'dragged', 'out', 'needlessly.So', 'set', 'worth', 'fans', 'show', 'Absolutely', 'show', 'presented', 'wide', 'screen', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'shot', 'surround', 'sound', 'incredible', 'can', 'hear', 'bugs', 'jungle', 'waves', 'shore', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'overwhelming', ""'re"", 'just', 'right', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'there', 'are', 'five', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'various', 'members', 'cast', 'crew', 'seventh', 'disc', 'nothing', 'bonus', 'material', 'documentaries', 'creation', 'series', 'casting', 'interesting', 'casting', 'videos', 'sometimes', 'actor', 'auditioning', 'roll', 'creating', 'pilot', 'fun', 'information', 'Driveshaft', 'bloopers', 'nineteen', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'set', 'nice', 'way', 'discs', 'are', 'set', 'case', 'three', 'hard', 'get', 'out', 'have', 'move', 'out', 'one', 'front', 'get', 'one', 'behind', 'not', 'big', 'issue', 'annoying.This', 'shows', 'combines', 'intriguing', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'great', 'writing', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '2', 'starts']",Lost - The Complete First Season

I think we all can agree that Lost is one of the deepest and coolest television shows to date, but the real question is, will this DVD be worth it?After watching Alias Season 1 on DVD and seeing how incredible the DVD is, I think that this package will be very desirable. It is likely that the cinematography will be improved and digitally reenhanced. TV reception will no longer be a factor, and no little ABC icon in the corner. It will probably have added bonuses that will be cool to see. If price doesn't change from now until it comes out, $38.99 is incredibly cheap! Alias S1 or any other TV DVD box set is usually $50+.Of course if these don't cut it, theres always the fact that you might want to buy this solely for the love of Lost, because it is such an interesting show each time you watch it you will get something new out of it.

633009,AXLXU4LMIRO3F,B00005JNOG,MartialWay,"[9, 11]","This show hooked me right away. How could it not? The people hating on this show because it's ""not realistic"" should stick to ""The Amazing Race"", ""Survivor"" or ""American Idol"" if they want reality. This is A-Grade suspense. It's compelling, and spellbinding, though yes, dialogue is a bit clich&eacute;d and some characters are as well. To me ""Lost"" is a refreshing, gutsy, series that I am quite impressed a network actually had the balls to air. Imagine this show on HBO, oh my God. It works so well within the confines of cowardly network standards and practices; I have to salute them for their ability to create a show on this level without having to stoop to gore-ifying, or excessive expletives.To me ""Lost"" is a kind of Fantasy Island in Hell, where people who have skeletons in their closets, checkers in their past or just bad karma check in to face their demons. Some are up to the challenge: Locke, Hurley, The Doctor (whose name I can't remember), Walt and Vincent the dog, Sayid and so forth. Others should just start swimming: Michael, Sawyer, Shannon (she even has the bathing suit), etc.Shows like ""Lost"" are demonstrating to me that networks are beginning to shed their cowardliness and start competing with HBO for our time. I enjoyed this first season very much, however, there is such potential for the creative people behind this to blow it that I am worried.I never watched ""Lost"" during its TV run, strictly DVD for me. I borrowed from my brother, and wound up buying it for myself. I'm glad I never took the time to watch it during its run, simply because (A) No commercials, and (B) No waiting for cliffhangers with the exception of the final episode.Much of this show is impressive and creative, but then there is a lot of corniness happening here too. Clearly they were ""brought"" to this island for a ""reason"", and frankly they are stretching this thin, thin enough to snap completely in future seasons if they aren't careful.I gave ""Lost"" Season 1 four stars, because it is enthralling, interesting and there are plenty of angles, and mysteries to ponder. I just hope the answers to all the questions are satisfying, because that could bring the whole thing down in flames. I really want to know what the deal is with this place, the castaways, the ""others"" and the numbers--- I just hope the payoff is worth the anguish they are putting us all through. There are a lot of people talking about how ""Lost"" is the best show on TV--- for me that depends entirely on how they end it, and that's a long way off, because the ""best show on TV"" can easily become the biggest letdown in TV history.Here's to ""Lost"" and it's creators, and lets all keep our fingers crossed that future seasons are all as good as this till the very last episode.

Most of the show is backstory and interpersonal drama.  The plot seems to go no where and the only thing to keep people interested is the slight hints at some darker purpose to the island.  I just wish the plot would move forward to drive character development instead of in-fighting being the plot device.  I find the idea interesting and most of the characters to be likeable as long as they stay true to their character which rarely happens or they just end up dead after creating an entire reason to like them and a role on the island.

633011,A1WWOZONMZ55SZ,B00005JNOG,"Mauricio Carvallo ""Melf""","[6, 8]","A few days ago I finally finished watching the 1st season( i tried watching it slowly so i could enjoy it more, and even though i was really surprised and satisfied with the season finale, i came to certain conlusions taht are not necessary positive about the show. Sure, the photography is great, acting is top notch, direction is excellent, sound and music really good, but not everything.First of all, people who haven't watched anything (which i believe are a few) shouldn't get their hopes up too much for the product, specially after readong a thousand reviews about how it is the best show around. This is because you will get your expectations too high and it is likely that they will not be met. That is what happened with me i guess, i came to expect too much and got a bit disappointed.Now, the series is, without a doubt, excellent in a number of aspects, but not in everything. For example, the story and plot is REALLy good, interesting, worthy of hours of speculation, and new. However, i have rarely seen one that moves as slowly as this one, i mean, you hardly know much more than what you did the first minute of the series. That is a big drawback, really, the plot moves really slow. Actually, the first two disc are extreamly BORING (except for the pilot of course)!!! Hardly anything happens, and the only memorable part from them are those well done twist that come as you approach the end of each episode.This lead to the next problem that viewers face, once the plots takes speed, you might be watching a series of really good, exciting and mind blowing episodes only to find that the next one is one boring piece of crap that has nothing interesting and that breaks the entire fludity of the series. And sometimes it is the other way, things couldn't be more boring and then WAM! the next episode blows you away with new unexpected things and shocking events.Also, though the plots goes on pretty well, the writers had so much to exploit and didn't!! For example, the misterious things that happen in the island, things that shouldn't happen, are completly wasted, instead of making emphasis on them, the episode  revolves around useless uniteresting, unimportant things like ""why does kate want the toy airplane so badly?"" So, there are times that you think that things are going to heat up fast and a new event changes everything, but the truth is that the writers choose to focus on other things.  ALSO: Don't be fooled by the back of the package ""...the action packed show that blablablba"" there is hardly any good action, and hardly any chases.However, despite of all this, there is one thing that the show does in superb way, unmatched in tv, and that is the development o the characters. Never before had i seen better written and interesting characters. Even the ones that you think that are going to be boring turn out to have an interesting life. Each of them is well acted and shows a convincing performance to their character's specific personality.I must admitt that there were a fair number of episodes in which i just gasped and my jaw dropped to the floor  as i saw some events in the show, the plot twists are that good. And you certainly will find yourself at the edge of your seat a few times.In conclusion, of course i recommend the shows, it is better than most things around these days, however,keep in mind that it is not free of mistakes and errors. If you like a good story with interesting characters and mistery and suspense, go ahead, buy it, its worth it.",4,"Really really great show, but it has its flaws (a spolier free review)",1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,3509,"['few', 'days', 'ago', 'finally', 'finished', 'watching', '1st', 'season', 'i', 'tried', 'watching', 'slowly', 'i', 'could', 'enjoy', 'more', 'even', 'i', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'satisfied', 'season', 'finale', 'i', 'came', 'certain', 'conlusions', 'taht', 'are', 'not', 'necessary', 'positive', 'show', 'Sure', 'photography', 'great', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'direction', 'excellent', 'sound', 'music', 'really', 'good', 'not', 'everything.First', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'anything', 'i', 'believe', 'are', 'few', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'too', 'much', 'product', 'specially', 'readong', 'thousand', 'reviews', 'how', 'best', 'show', 'around', 'will', 'get', 'expectations', 'too', 'high', 'likely', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'met', 'what', 'happened', 'i', 'guess', 'i', 'came', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'got', 'bit', 'disappointed.Now', 'series', 'doubt', 'excellent', 'number', 'aspects', 'not', 'everything', 'example', 'story', 'plot', 'REALLy', 'good', 'interesting', 'worthy', 'hours', 'speculation', 'new', 'However', 'i', 'have', 'rarely', 'seen', 'one', 'as', 'slowly', 'one', 'i', 'mean', 'hardly', 'know', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'did', 'first', 'minute', 'series', 'big', 'drawback', 'really', 'plot', 'moves', 'really', 'slow', 'Actually', 'first', 'two', 'disc', 'are', 'extreamly', 'BORING', 'pilot', 'course', 'Hardly', 'anything', 'only', 'memorable', 'part', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'twist', 'come', 'approach', 'end', 'episode.This', 'lead', 'next', 'problem', 'viewers', 'face', 'once', 'plots', 'speed', 'might', 'be', 'watching', 'series', 'really', 'good', 'exciting', 'mind', 'blowing', 'only', 'find', 'next', 'one', 'one', 'boring', 'piece', 'crap', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'entire', 'fludity', 'series', 'other', 'way', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'boring', 'then', 'WAM', 'next', 'episode', 'away', 'new', 'unexpected', 'things', 'shocking', 'events.Also', 'plots', 'pretty', 'well', 'writers', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'exploit', 'did', ""n't"", 'example', 'misterious', 'things', 'happen', 'island', 'things', 'should', ""n't"", 'happen', 'are', 'completly', 'wasted', 'instead', 'making', 'emphasis', 'episode', 'useless', 'uniteresting', 'unimportant', 'things', 'why', 'kate', 'want', 'toy', 'airplane', 'so', 'badly', 'So', 'are', 'times', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'heat', 'up', 'fast', 'new', 'event', 'changes', 'everything', 'truth', 'writers', 'choose', 'focus', 'other', 'things', 'ALSO', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'back', 'package', 'action', 'packed', 'show', 'blablablba', 'hardly', 'good', 'action', 'hardly', 'chases.However', 'one', 'thing', 'show', 'superb', 'way', 'unmatched', 'tv', 'development', 'characters', 'Never', 'had', 'i', 'seen', 'better', 'written', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Even', 'ones', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'boring', 'turn', 'out', 'have', 'interesting', 'life', 'well', 'acted', 'convincing', 'performance', 'character', 'specific', 'personality.I', 'must', 'admitt', 'were', 'fair', 'number', 'episodes', 'i', 'just', 'gasped', 'jaw', 'dropped', 'floor', 'i', 'saw', 'events', 'show', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'good', 'certainly', 'will', 'find', 'edge', 'seat', 'few', 'times.In', 'conclusion', 'course', 'i', 'recommend', 'shows', 'better', 'most', 'things', 'days', 'however', 'keep', 'mind', 'not', 'free', 'mistakes', 'errors', 'like', 'good', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'mistery', 'suspense', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'worth']",Lost - The Complete First Season

633013,AFJCOP0GKZH6C,B00005JNOG,M. B. Trapp,"[7, 7]","I loathe television. Ask my wife. I'll watch a football game here and there or a special on the History Channel, but I absolutely do NOT watch regular television series, except for rare occasions. The only exception is ABC's Lost. After having a friend sing its praises to me last year and witnessing all the media hoopla about the season finale, I decided to watch it from the beginning this summer when they started re-airing the episodes. I brought my wife along by the third episode, and by the fourth episode (the Emmy-nominated ""Walkabout""), we were hooked. But since ABC started skipping episodes this summer we decided to quit watching and wait for the Season 1 DVD to come out.Why Lost is such a big hit is no mystery: take an interesting concept (plane crash survivors stranded on a strange island where very weird things happen) and mix it with strong characters and first-rate cinematic storytelling and you have a winner. My wife often comments that when we watch Lost it feels more like we're watching a movie than a TV series. Some have blamed the current dearth of box office attendance to the fact that Hollywood is simply making bad movies. When I watch Lost, I understand why: all the good writers are working in television!I suppose you could say I like the show because it deals with philosophical and religious themes (for example, people are mysteriously healed of physical and psychological trauma on the island, seemingly out of nowhere), but the simple fact is that the producers and writers of Lost are just good at narrative storytelling. When these types of concepts work, it's not solely because of the concept but because the viewer is made to care about the characters that have to deal with that concept. The episodes are unique in that each one is intercut with flashbacks of the lives of different characters before their plane crashed on the island. The writers use this device to explain why the characters are the way they are and why exactly they behave in certain ways in certain situations. There are no one-dimensional characters here. The events in the backstory of Sawyer, for example, make up one of the best tragic tales I've seen on screen in years.But the mystery of the island is something that keeps people coming back as well. Every week a new nugget of information is revealed about the island, but never enough that would spoil all the fun. Watching this DVD set is better than the lion's share of all the junk released by Hollywood last year. There are a few weak episodes, but that's to be expected in an hour-long drama that is essentially telling one very long tale.",5,The best show of the last thousand years or so,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2623,"['loathe', 'television', 'Ask', 'wife', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'football', 'game', 'here', 'there', 'special', 'History', 'Channel', 'absolutely', 'do', 'NOT', 'watch', 'regular', 'television', 'series', 'rare', 'occasions', 'only', 'exception', 'ABC', 'Lost', 'having', 'friend', 'sing', 'praises', 'last', 'year', 'witnessing', 'media', 'hoopla', 'season', 'finale', 'decided', 'watch', 'beginning', 'summer', 'when', 'started', 're-airing', 'episodes', 'brought', 'wife', 'third', 'episode', 'fourth', 'episode', 'Emmy-nominated', 'Walkabout', 'were', 'hooked', 'ABC', 'started', 'skipping', 'episodes', 'summer', 'decided', 'quit', 'watching', 'wait', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'come', 'out.Why', 'Lost', 'such', 'big', 'hit', 'mystery', 'take', 'interesting', 'concept', 'plane', 'crash', 'survivors', 'stranded', 'strange', 'island', 'where', 'very', 'weird', 'things', 'happen', 'mix', 'strong', 'characters', 'first-rate', 'cinematic', 'storytelling', 'have', 'winner', 'wife', 'often', 'comments', 'when', 'watch', 'Lost', 'more', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'TV', 'series', 'have', 'blamed', 'current', 'dearth', 'box', 'office', 'attendance', 'fact', 'Hollywood', 'simply', 'making', 'bad', 'movies', 'When', 'watch', 'Lost', 'understand', 'why', 'good', 'writers', 'are', 'working', 'television', 'suppose', 'could', 'say', 'show', 'philosophical', 'religious', 'themes', 'example', 'people', 'are', 'mysteriously', 'healed', 'physical', 'psychological', 'trauma', 'island', 'seemingly', 'nowhere', 'simple', 'fact', 'producers', 'writers', 'Lost', 'are', 'just', 'good', 'narrative', 'storytelling', 'When', 'types', 'concepts', 'work', 'not', 'solely', 'concept', 'viewer', 'made', 'care', 'characters', 'have', 'deal', 'concept', 'episodes', 'are', 'unique', 'one', 'intercut', 'flashbacks', 'lives', 'different', 'characters', 'plane', 'crashed', 'island', 'writers', 'use', 'device', 'explain', 'why', 'characters', 'are', 'way', 'are', 'why', 'exactly', 'behave', 'certain', 'ways', 'certain', 'situations', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'here', 'events', 'backstory', 'Sawyer', 'example', 'make', 'up', 'one', 'best', 'tragic', 'tales', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'screen', 'mystery', 'island', 'something', 'people', 'coming', 'back', 'as', 'well', 'Every', 'week', 'new', 'nugget', 'information', 'revealed', 'island', 'never', 'enough', 'would', 'spoil', 'fun', 'Watching', 'DVD', 'set', 'better', 'lion', 'share', 'junk', 'released', 'Hollywood', 'last', 'year', 'are', 'few', 'weak', 'episodes', 'be', 'expected', 'hour-long', 'drama', 'essentially', 'telling', 'one', 'very', 'long', 'tale']",Lost - The Complete First Season

633024,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B00005JNOG,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","Lost is not for the instant gratification crowd.  If you hate mysteries or need to have everything solved and worked out in a short amount of time, this series will frustrate the hell out of you. If you take the series Alias and mix it with the movie Castaway (except have an ensemble cast instead of just one person marooned on the island) you have Lost.  The series starts out in the aftermath of the crash of a plane from Australia to the United States.  From there it, in parallel, tells the back story of the characters stuck on the island through flashbacks and then tells the story of their attempt to survive.If you look back at the first season there were two main things it did.  First it developed the &#34;main&#34; characters, by giving you their back stories in dribs and drabs and secondly it introduced the secrets of the island.  By the end if the season you have a pretty good idea of who the characters are, but you know little to nothing about the island and the things/people that were on it before the plane crash.  There are tons of weird twists and turns throughout.What was probably the hardest thing to pull of for a series like this was to give all the characters time to develop and make them interesting.  There are some episodes where some characters are barely in it other than in the background.  Each of the &#34;main&#34; characters get focused on though, sometimes with an entire episode devoted to them.  I think they struck the best balance they could to get you to a point where you were invested in the characters you were supposed to be invested in.The writing and acting in the first season was top notch.  The story was a great blend of drama, mystery, suspense and very dark comedy.  The season ends on two big cliffhangers and definitely leaves you wanting more.  As far as the discs themselves for those who get the blu rays, the A/V quality is top notch.  There are a ton of extras, including almost 2 hrs of behind the scenes, extended scenes and making of material on the last disc.  Definitely enough to make the people who like to go through that stuff happy.

I never watched the series on TV and my first exposure to the series was when I couldn't find an interesting movie to rent, so I decided to take a chance and rent the first disc of ""Lost"".  After seeing the first 4 episodes, I had to buy the entire season.  Owning the entire season is great, it allows you to immediately start the next episode when the show ends on a cliff hanger, which is almost every week.This is the type of show that really had to exist in an age of Tivo or DVD box sets.  I can't imagine how you could appreciate the series if you occasionally missed an episode.  The writers did a great job of weaving numerous sub-plots through each episode.  At the end of the season, there are still a large number of unanswered questions.The cast includes a number of likeable characters.  I couldn't stand Matthew Fox on ""Party of 5"", but he fits well into this show.  There are really few weak links here.I would recommend this box set to just about anyone.  While some of the scenes are a little intense for very young viewers, most people will not be offended by the violence depicted.  Each episode has its share of suspense, and the entire series has the 1st rate quality of a production intended for the big screen, which is extremely rare for network television fare.  The 7th disc has some very good special features.  All in all, this is a great series to own.

So when season 1 finally came out on blu-ray I decided to get started on this series and man, oh man am I glad I did.  I'm also extremely pleased I had the patience to wait.  Not only is this show beautiful on blu-ray, but I don't think I could take waiting 6 months to a year to start watching season 2.  This show now ranks at number 2 on my favorite all-time show list right behind the Sopranos, and right above Breaking Bad.  There are 25 episodes in total and I finished season 1 in about a week.  This show leaves you hanging so much I was so glad I could just skip to the next show and start watching.  I was watching about 4 shows a night.  The only negative thing I can say about it is I wasn't getting enough sleep at night and going to work extremely tired because I just had to see what would happen next.  Almost every episode I would say this is my last one then I'm going to bed, but as soon as it ended I would start right up on the next one.  It also has an awesome season play feature.  Which means you can stop watching at any time, even take out the disc, then put it back in later and start watching from the exact same spot.  Pretty cool.  So if your like me and never watched Lost when it came on t.v. you picked a great time to start.  There is enough time to pick up seasons 1-5 on blu-ray then to start watching the season finale when it starts which I think is in January 2010.  And if you have already seen all the episodes the blu-ray is absolutely beautiful and well worth the money.  If you already own the DVD's it's still worth picking up the blu-ray because you get a $20 dollar mail in rebate with it for having already purchased the DVDs.

Roll on series 2.When I am reading a book, or watching a film or a television series, I like to see good charachter developement. There is excellent character development in this show. I find it impossible to say which charachter I like most as I am drawn to nearly all the characters. They all have amazing stories. They all have a reason for acting and behaving the way they do. Which I guess teaches us a lesson. We should not judge people too harshly on our first impressions. You never really know what has gone on or is going on in their lives to make them act as they do.The story here is amazing. I wont go into it here, as this is done by other reviewers. But it is brilliant and takes many twists and turn. Basically expect the unexpected. The ending of the series was brilliant. And it was only half way through the last episode that I started to guess what might happen. Excellently done.Then there is the acting, which really is in a class of its own.

633040,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B00005JNOG,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[9, 11]","From Alias creator J. J. Abrams, the landmark first season of Lost became a critical success and a ratings juggernaut for ABC.  Beginning with a mysterious plane crash, a large group of survivors find themselves stranded on a seemingly deserted island.  As the season unfolds, each character is given a flashback-style glimpse into their past and the events that lead them to boarding the plane, while they each learn that there is something lurking on the island; something strange, and very deadly.  All this leads the survivors to discover that they are not the only ones on the island, and the season ending discovery of a strange metal hatch and what lurks inside will leave you salivating for season two.  Lost's large cast, including Matthew Fox as the resident doctor Jack, Lord of the Rings' Dominic Monaghan as heroin raddled fallen rock star Charlie, newcomer Evangeline Lily as the mysterious Kate, Milennium's Terry O'Quinn as survivalist John, and Oz's Harold Perrineau who is here along with his young, disobedient son.  The rest of the cast, including Daniel Dae Kim, Ian Somerhalder, Naveen Andrews, and Jorge Garcia among others, do great work, and by the end of this season, one of them will be dead, and there will be more questions than answers.  The storytelling is sharp (including David Fury as a staff writer, who wrote and directed some of the best episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel), and with the unique aspect of the show, it's no secret why Lost has become such a runaway hit.  As a previous reviewer stated, superb shows of the last few years such as the X-Files, Buffy, Angel, and Farscape didn't achieve true perfection until their second season, and if Lost manages to fall into the same category, then it's time to prepare for something really special, and now has never been a better time to get Lost.",5,Get Lost,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,1849,"['Alias', 'creator', 'J.', 'J.', 'Abrams', 'landmark', 'first', 'season', 'Lost', 'became', 'critical', 'success', 'ratings', 'juggernaut', 'ABC', 'Beginning', 'mysterious', 'plane', 'crash', 'large', 'group', 'survivors', 'find', 'stranded', 'seemingly', 'deserted', 'island', 'season', 'unfolds', 'character', 'given', 'flashback-style', 'glimpse', 'past', 'events', 'lead', 'boarding', 'plane', 'learn', 'something', 'lurking', 'island', 'something', 'strange', 'very', 'deadly', 'survivors', 'discover', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'ones', 'island', 'season', 'ending', 'discovery', 'strange', 'metal', 'hatch', 'what', 'inside', 'will', 'leave', 'salivating', 'season', 'two', 'Lost', 'large', 'cast', 'including', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'resident', 'doctor', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'heroin', 'raddled', 'fallen', 'rock', 'star', 'Charlie', 'newcomer', 'Evangeline', 'Lily', 'mysterious', 'Kate', 'Milennium', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'survivalist', 'John', 'Oz', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'who', 'here', 'along', 'young', 'disobedient', 'son', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'Jorge', 'Garcia', 'others', 'do', 'great', 'work', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'storytelling', 'sharp', 'including', 'David', 'Fury', 'staff', 'writer', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'best', 'episodes', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Angel', 'unique', 'aspect', 'show', 'secret', 'why', 'Lost', 'become', 'runaway', 'hit', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'superb', 'shows', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'such', 'X-Files', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Farscape', 'did', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'true', 'perfection', 'second', 'season', 'Lost', 'manages', 'fall', 'same', 'category', 'then', 'time', 'prepare', 'something', 'really', 'special', 'now', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'time', 'get', 'Lost']",Lost - The Complete First Season

The bad news is that it will spoil you from wanting to sit through new episodes, one week at a time with commercial breaks.Everything about this show works...the cast, their performances, cinematography, soundtrack, plot devices, EVERYTHING!  Skill and serendipity come together in a perfect mixture.  Having the ability to watch multiple episodes in one sitting greatly enhances the LOST experience.  Unfortunately, having to wait for new episodes on TV each week results in forgetting certain nuances or plot points that are so integral to the fun and mystery of the overall show.Great special features on Disc 7 (the entire product is as thoughtfully and beautifully produced as the series itself).  If only all series were given the care, backing and attention of this one, the world of network television would be elevated to a much higher level.My only pet peeve is that most (NOT ALL! There are definite exceptions...) of the commentary tracks feature participation from multiple actors/producers that essentially turn into a joke fest of insider's humor or recollections that do little to enhance the ""behind the scenes"" information.  It would have been better to limit these commentaries to one or two participants at a time and have them addressing the home viewer rather than each other.LOST Season One has set a very high bar and I hope they'll keep it up for all the seasons to follow.

This is one hell of a way to watch Lost on DVD. Those who sat through the episodes as they aired will admit that as one of the biggest selling TV series DVD box sets in history (also see `Firefly' for similar achievements) is better than the best of science-fiction series we have seen yet still offers many norms taken, and used well, from some of the best sitcoms of the twentieth-century. It is part `ER', part `Star Trek', part `Twin Peaks', part `Gilligan's Island', a whole big bit of `Survivor' with real drama and yet totally unique in every conceivable way and form with the episode (third on this season's disc 1) `Walkabout', which is widely considered one the best television episodes for any series ever aired. Lost will catch you hook, line and sinker. This will put a stop on every other media you watch or listen to for the next couple of days. The logistics are simple. A plane travelling from Sydney to LA has veered 1000km off course and smashed into an island strewing the passengers everywhere who soon learn from a co-pilot that their rescuers are looking for them in the wrong place. When the co-pilot is hurled into the air and eaten alive by an invisible beast who stalks the island the audience comes to realize that the island is no ordinary island, and so do the survivors who set about establishing themselves and facing various challenges that befall them. Who are they and will they survive? Will the Doctor fall for the possibly dangerous freckled heroin? Will the junkie die? Who stole her baby? Where did Locke learn to use a 9mm like that? Where does the electric cable come from? What is in the underground hatch? Who are the others? Are the fish poisonous? Is it in the future? Is he psychic? Are there dinosaurs? Is he who he really says he is? Who murdered him? Are there ghosts? Is this all an experiment? These are the kind of questions that can come up in a single episode of Lost. With that said and done there is much in Lost that can be rationally explained but a whole hunk of it will leave you Lost and bewildered. It may be as painful as having a tooth extraction waiting for the answer to any of the major questions but some of the smaller ones are eventually uncovered towards the end of Season one. So expect to sit through quite a number of background history stories for the series character build-ups, that are quite well driven, although extremely odd at times.Of course there is the death clock element. People will die. Who do you side with and why? Who do you hope makes it and who do you secretly hope doesn't? Can Sayid stay macho dating women on the island? Will Dr. Jack get it on with criminal Kate? Will Hurley loose weight? Is Sawyer dead? Is Jin going to beat his wife? Will Sun leave him? Why does Locke like the island so much? Is Charlie going to marry Claire? Will Michael's plan work? Is Shannon too hysterical to survive? Will her brother Boone be able to keep his balance on a tipping plane? You just don't know how things will go. The seven degrees of separation instead becomes one degree as everybody has a distinctive relationship with everyone else, including you. The racial degrees of actors and actresses gives Lost a worldwide appeal, and deservingly so, as who can say that they don't enjoy the suspense and mystery it has to offer. In a day and age when television is boring there is nothing quite like Lost, nor will there be for some time to come. Yes we can complain that this can drag on to keep the bucks flowing but even Firefly only lasted one season.

It's very much like a daytime soap, just with a more interesting premise/locale to get things started. The vague hints at paranormal phenomena are explored with such limited detail that only the most dedicated fan could feign interest in speculating about the nature of the island and the possible reason for the people being there. The slow burning plot seems motivated by similar ambitions to Carnivale, but Lost doesn't even have ambience to rest on because the atmosphere of this show is so uncompromisingly sterile.

633055,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B00005JNOG,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[0, 0]","Lost is theHarry Potterof television.  With its intricately planned plots, fully fleshed out characters with well-thought out back stories, and a wild premise that is brilliantly executed, this is a show with truly universal appeal.  It's enough to entertain the ""we love action!"" crowd, but there is also a deeper level to this show, which often works on metaphor as it connects the `main story' of Lost to the characters' histories, utilizing flashbacks in each episode.Unlike J. J. Abram's last series (Alias), you won't be checking the time while you're watching the first season of ""Lost.""  Every one of these twenty-two episodes is completely enthralling, focusing on the history and current situation of one character at a time.  Even the less interesting characters are easily able to hold up their own episodes.  There is always more to find out about each character as the seasonal arc builds, never giving the audience too little or too much.  Because that's what this show is really based on: mystery.  Be warned, Lost is not, I repeat, not for the impatient.  The arc of this series is based on the mystery of this island and the people who have landed on it, and every single time one of those nagging questions is answered, we are given a new question.  From the mystifying hatch, to the captivating character of John Locke, to the island itself, the sheer need to find out `what the heck is going on' will drive you through this season.Take all of that good stuff and add a cast of actors with rare talent and the most beautiful on-location scenes you'll find on network television, and you have the phenomenon that is the first season of ""Lost.""

633057,ADE852UR9121C,B00005JNOG,perfecto,"[7, 7]","I'm writing this review right after watching the season finale. This is one hell of a good show. I wish I could meet the writers of this series and ask them ""Where on earth do you come up with this stuff?"" That's some really good $hit they give us every week. At the end of every show, I go ""F**k!"" because it's so nerve wrecking thinking what's gonna happen next. The intensity is just unbelievable!OK, I guess I should calm down and write this review. As you can see, the excitement really gets to me. When I first heard of this show, I thought it was some lame Survivor kind of rip-of. But right after watching the first few minutes of the show, I knew I couldn't have been more wrong. This show is basically about a group of plane crash survivors. They land on this island that they know nothing of. Every episode, we see how these people survive. We are given glimpses of the person's life before the crash, and how it led them on to the flight which crashed. Most, if not all of the people's stories reveal a side of the people that we do not expect, some more surprising than others. And that's not all, the island itself is a mystery. Weird noises are heard at night, but what is making those sounds? Strange events start to occur which is impossible to explain. The survivors soon find out that they are not alone in the island, there are others but who are they? These are just some of the many things that progresses over time in this show. C'mon, how anyone could resist this show is totally beyond me.First of all, I have to say kudos to the writers. The stories are written in such a way, that it intrigues you, it draws you in. The anticipation to watch the following week's episode is really killing you. I am usually at the edge of my seat watching this show, literally! And I didn't even realize it until someone pointed it out to me. That's how much this show grabs you. Next, this show has a killer cast. Never have I seen a cast which works so well with the show. Their acting never fails to evoke some kind of emotion within me, and that sure doesn't happen much. You find yourself really caring what happens to each of them. Other than those factors, I just think that everything works in perfect symphony for this show, thus the 5-star rating. The lighting, the set, the directing...everything!In short, this is THE show to watch. The DVD set is not even released and I've already pre-ordered it. And I've never pre-ordered anything before. At a time when TV networks are flooded with teen dramas and reality crap, this is a refreshing change. I love this show, it's off to a good start and if these guys can end this series with the same intensity that they started it...this might very well be one of those classic TV shows that people talk about 10, 20 years from now.

In a world where silly reality TV seems to have taken over, it is refreshing to see a quality show out there like LOST. I had never seen an episode of Lost until I watched the entire DVD set. I was afraid to give it a chance when it was on TV, but after seeing mostly positive reviews from people here on amazon I figured I would give the show a chance. All I can say is I am glad I did. Lost is one of the few shows that hooks you in, gets you addicted, and takes you on this emotional journey with the characters. I give Disney a lot of credit for releasing such a beautiful DVD set. They really put much time and effort in to the LOST DVD set and it shows. The set is a digipak which slides out of the plastic sleeve from the bottom, and opens to hold the 7 discs. Three of the digipak panels contain 2 overlapping (think Lois & Clark: the New Adventures of Superman) discs, and the 7th disc stands alone.

A few dozen people survive a plane crash on an island, as they struggle to survive, they find they are challenged by the island inhabitants, and not all of them are human. We focus on 14 of the survivors, all have a secret. Each episode focuses on 1 survivor and we get flashbacks to their past, and in some cases it ties in with the islandMany episodes stand out, mainly the pilot, Numbers, Deus Ex Machina, and Exodus. However, once you see the second season, this seems inferior, yet still better then most everything else. The characters are so well-developed and you feel you know all about them, and yet there will still be something new you learn. And the suspense, wow, when one episode ends, you can't help but pop the next one in.Now the special features are great. There are deleted scenes, outtakes, and several featurettes, so much that there is another seperate disc for all of it. The commentaries are good also.So if you like mystery (and can handle waiting a long time for answers, which some fans are so impatient they stop altogether which you should never do) and like a large ensemble cast, this is what you need.",5,Great start for a great show,1151020800,"06 23, 2006",2006,1211,"['became', 'Lost-obsessed', 'late', 'season', 'However', 'was', 'hooked', 'immedietly', 'few', 'dozen', 'people', 'survive', 'plane', 'crash', 'island', 'struggle', 'survive', 'find', 'are', 'challenged', 'island', 'inhabitants', 'not', 'are', 'human', 'focus', '14', 'survivors', 'have', 'secret', 'episode', '1', 'survivor', 'get', 'flashbacks', 'past', 'cases', 'islandMany', 'episodes', 'stand', 'out', 'mainly', 'pilot', 'Numbers', 'Deus', 'Ex', 'Machina', 'Exodus', 'However', 'once', 'see', 'second', 'season', 'inferior', 'yet', 'still', 'better', 'then', 'most', 'everything', 'else', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'well-developed', 'feel', 'know', 'yet', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'something', 'new', 'learn', 'suspense', 'wow', 'when', 'one', 'episode', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'pop', 'next', 'one', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'several', 'featurettes', 'so', 'much', 'seperate', 'disc', 'commentaries', 'are', 'good', 'also.So', 'like', 'mystery', 'can', 'handle', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'answers', 'fans', 'are', 'so', 'impatient', 'stop', 'altogether', 'should', 'never', 'do', 'large', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'what', 'need']",Lost - The Complete First Season
633066,A2U961E4K6ZN1C,B00005JNOG,Quasimodal,"[10, 30]","Watching ""Lost (1)"" after ""24 (4)"" this is what I liked and disliked in ""Lost""- Acting is good. Actors are devoted to their role and are convicing- The idea of a group of people coming from different horizons and pasts forced to live together in order to know eachother is well exploited.- Direction and photography are good.However it doesn't take long to figure out that the scriptwriters1. ensure the lost team will *never* escape! It is unfortunately too obvious that many situations were created a non realistic way just... to last. Each time there is a tangible way for this lost team to reach the civilization or to escape, they must simply fail. After a while anybody should be able to guess how they will actually fail :)2. while they certainly got inspired from ""24"" (e.g. emotional tensions, torture...), they didn't work the scenario of ""Lost"" as deeply as the ""24""'s one - at several occasions some conflictual situations are completely irrelevant - the ins and outs of the situations lack of logic.3. know well that the best way to keep this show alive is to reveal as little information as possible. After, say, 4 or 8 episodes you don't need to watch the rest... unless your objective is to go into digging everybody's personality through the flashbacks. The show is made to last, period. So, don't think/hope/expect that the plot of this show is to clear up little by little all the island mysteries, or you'll get frustrated. Just look at it as a reality show where everybody's life is brought to light, little by little (and this is rather well done), while, sometimes, some obscur events occur... which - in all likelihood - they're just here to distract you as they will never get explained.So why the rating of ""Lost"" is that high?  Because most of us need to escape the harsh realities of life - in ""Lost"" the average trend is ""good ending"" - episodes end usually on a positive ""hope"" note where all's well that ends well. Some ""miracles"" happen allowing possible changes to some usually inescapable life problems - this  ""Green Mile"" like  atmosphere pleases the ones who need some dreaming in their life. I would have preferred a more realistic show with a more elaborated scenario able to bring solutions at the end to all the intrigues created at the beginning (minus two stars for that).",3,A never ending story...,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2315,"['Watching', 'Lost', '1', '24', '4', 'what', 'liked', 'disliked', 'Lost', 'Acting', 'good', 'Actors', 'are', 'devoted', 'role', 'are', 'convicing-', 'idea', 'group', 'people', 'coming', 'different', 'horizons', 'pasts', 'forced', 'live', 'together', 'order', 'know', 'eachother', 'well', 'exploited.-', 'Direction', 'photography', 'are', 'good.However', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'figure', 'out', 'scriptwriters1', 'ensure', 'lost', 'team', 'will', '*never*', 'escape', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'obvious', 'many', 'situations', 'were', 'created', 'non', 'realistic', 'way', 'just', 'last', 'time', 'tangible', 'way', 'lost', 'team', 'reach', 'civilization', 'escape', 'must', 'simply', 'fail', 'while', 'anybody', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'guess', 'how', 'will', 'actually', 'fail', '2.', 'certainly', 'got', 'inspired', '24', 'e.g', 'emotional', 'tensions', 'torture', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'scenario', 'Lost', 'as', 'deeply', '24', 'one', 'several', 'occasions', 'conflictual', 'situations', 'are', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'ins', 'outs', 'situations', 'lack', 'logic.3', 'know', 'well', 'best', 'way', 'keep', 'show', 'alive', 'reveal', 'little', 'information', 'possible', 'say', '4', '8', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'watch', 'rest', 'objective', 'go', 'digging', 'everybody', 'personality', 'flashbacks', 'show', 'made', 'last', 'period', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'think/hope/expect', 'plot', 'show', 'clear', 'up', 'little', 'little', 'island', 'mysteries', ""'ll"", 'get', 'frustrated', 'Just', 'look', 'reality', 'show', 'where', 'everybody', 'life', 'brought', 'light', 'little', 'little', 'rather', 'well', 'done', 'sometimes', 'obscur', 'events', 'occur', 'likelihood', ""'re"", 'just', 'here', 'distract', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'explained.So', 'why', 'rating', 'Lost', 'high', 'most', 'need', 'escape', 'harsh', 'realities', 'life', 'Lost', 'average', 'trend', 'good', 'ending', 'episodes', 'end', 'usually', 'positive', 'hope', 'note', 'where', 'well', 'well', 'miracles', 'happen', 'allowing', 'possible', 'changes', 'usually', 'inescapable', 'life', 'problems', 'Green', 'Mile', 'atmosphere', 'ones', 'who', 'need', 'dreaming', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'realistic', 'show', 'more', 'elaborated', 'scenario', 'able', 'bring', 'solutions', 'end', 'intrigues', 'created', 'beginning', 'two', 'stars']",Lost - The Complete First Season
633067,A1QGMIQD8ZYDS8,B00005JNOG,"Ralph J. Fitcher ""Namahotitae""","[0, 0]","First let me say that this is a review of the entire series and not just the season. I will post this under every season so that everyone can see this review.  Now, in my opinion Lost is one of those once in a lifetime shows that will never come around again. Lost has a beginning and an ending, but to fully enjoy Lost you need to own and watch all of the seasons sequentially. They are all great seasons. While I do like some seasons better than others, I find them all an intricate piece of the overall puzzle that is Lost. In order my choices for seasons are:Season 1Season 2Season 3Season 5Season 6Season 4  I believe the writers strike really messed this season up.*****Spoiler Alert *******Lost is a story about a group of people who crash land on an island. They soon discover this is not just any island, there are ""Others"" living on the island. There are various life forms living there that should not be able to live there such as a smoke monster(explained in season six), a huge polar bear etc. The island has certain properties as well, such as women who become pregnant do not live to full term, there are also hatches on the island from a former group called ""The Dharma Initiative."" These inhabitants were killed off by ""The leader of The Others."" (Explained in season 3) When it becomes apparent that rescue is not coming to the survivors thing really start to heat up on the island. Eventually some of the survivors do manage to get off of the island (season 5) during which time the rest end up back in time (yes the island can move through time)and find a way to work in the Dharma Initiative. When those who had been off the island find a way back, all hell breaks loose. I won't tell you how it ends for a number of reasons, but I will say that I was very happy and disappointed in the ending. The ending had answered most of my questions satisfactorily only to leave me feeling a bit empty about the whole series.*****End Spoiler Alert******If you want to be hooked on a great series buy the whole series and enjoy. I personally could not watch each episode fast enough once I started. I found every excuse to watch show after show. I cannot remember the last time I had felt this way about a TV show.

I have to say that this show is one of the few TV shows which offers intelligent, detailed storytelling these days. The cast is strong and varied as well. The episodes all offer flashbacks to previous events in the characters' lives, before the airplane crash which left them stranded on a rather strange island in the Pacific, and this has a way of making the characters richer...fuller. Not all of the characters are likeable; all have human flaws and issues which make the whole story more real.The supernatural strangeness of the island also has a way of pulling you in. From the character which shouldn't be able to walk, but does, to the airplane wreckage which is pulled away into the ocean, leaving no traces, to the mysterious numbers which have drawn people to the island, you know that something's not right, but the characters have little time to spend to figure it out, as they are struggling to survive. And struggle they must, for limited resources, for shelter, and against the island's monster and the islands other, mysterious, vicious inhabitants.Now, with the first season over, and few of the mysteries really resolved (though, one of them, being what the island's monster looks like, has been at least partially answered), and I've been left wanting more.It's a long wait until the fall.",5,Feeling Lost?,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,1388,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Lost', 'past', 'TV', 'season', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'last', 'night', 'have', 'say', 'show', 'one', 'few', 'TV', 'shows', 'intelligent', 'detailed', 'storytelling', 'days', 'cast', 'strong', 'varied', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'offer', 'flashbacks', 'previous', 'events', 'characters', 'lives', 'airplane', 'crash', 'left', 'stranded', 'rather', 'strange', 'island', 'Pacific', 'way', 'making', 'characters', 'richer', 'fuller', 'Not', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'have', 'human', 'flaws', 'issues', 'make', 'whole', 'story', 'more', 'real.The', 'supernatural', 'strangeness', 'island', 'also', 'way', 'pulling', 'character', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'walk', 'airplane', 'wreckage', 'pulled', 'away', 'ocean', 'leaving', 'traces', 'mysterious', 'numbers', 'have', 'drawn', 'people', 'island', 'know', 'something', 'not', 'right', 'characters', 'have', 'little', 'time', 'spend', 'figure', 'out', 'are', 'struggling', 'survive', 'struggle', 'must', 'limited', 'resources', 'shelter', 'island', 'monster', 'islands', 'other', 'mysterious', 'vicious', 'inhabitants.Now', 'first', 'season', 'few', 'mysteries', 'really', 'resolved', 'one', 'being', 'what', 'island', 'monster', 'been', 'least', 'partially', 'answered', ""'ve"", 'been', 'left', 'wanting', 'more.It', 'long', 'wait', 'fall']",Lost - The Complete First Season

It's been done before, from ""Gilligan's Island"" to ""Lord of the Flies"" to the mother of all reality television ""Survivor"". But it's never been done quite like `Lost'.A plane runs into trouble and crashes on a tropical island, leaving the passengers to fend for themselves. Among the forty-eight survivors are a range of intriguing individuals: a doctor, an ex-rock star with a drug addiction, an Iraqi man regarded suspiciously in a post-9/11 world, a convict, an easy-going joker who considers himself cursed, a lifeguard and his catty sister, a Korean couple who can't speak English, a red-neck jerk who loves to stir up trouble, a pregnant woman, and a paraplegic who has inexplicitly regained the use of his legs on the island.There are the usual social issues; mistrust among the group, hunting for food, romantic tension, post-traumatic stress, etc, and if you like social dramas, this would be enough to sustain the show. But ""Lost"" goes one step further, since each of our main characters have a Deep Dark Secret. Each episode is based around a particular character, who is explored through a series of flashbacks that reveal their past life and the circumstances leading up to their boarding of the fateful plane.And if this wasn't enough, the writers also throw in a few curveballs as to the unknown nature of the island. There's a giant creature of some kind that's already chomped down a few people, a series of ghostly appearances and a polar bear. Yes, that's right, a polar bear. Whether these mysteries are going to end up as something amazingly clever, or utterly stupid remains to be seen, but the way in which it's unfolding is both intriguing and spooky, and the show's creators have already stated that there is a master-plan in terms of the gradually infolding mystery.Some components induce eye-rolling: with only a few exceptions, all the survivors are both very attractive and in great physical condition - which means that the writers are constantly coming up with new ways to undress them. One particularly innovative episode was a run-in with a bee's nest that had our models rushing around tearing their clothes off in a frenzy. Oy.But the show's fascination cannot be denied, nor can its underlying theme of fate that draws all its main characters together. The flashbacks hint toward an uncanny connection between the characters (for example, one character unknowingly has a conversation with another character's father, and another owns the box factory in which another works)and the continuity is drawn out with immense care.It is this intriguing connection between the characters, the ongoing mystery, and the care with which the pieces of the puzzle are brought together that makes ""Lost"" compulsive viewing.",5,"""It'll All Come Back Around...""",1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,2851,"['group', 'strangers', 'stranded', 'together', 'deserted', 'island', 'forced', 'survive', 'other', 'elements', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'mother', 'reality', 'television', 'Survivor', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'quite', 'like', ""Lost'.A"", 'plane', 'trouble', 'crashes', 'tropical', 'island', 'leaving', 'passengers', 'fend', 'forty-eight', 'survivors', 'are', 'range', 'intriguing', 'individuals', 'doctor', 'ex-rock', 'star', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Iraqi', 'man', 'regarded', 'suspiciously', 'post-9/11', 'world', 'convict', 'easy-going', 'joker', 'who', 'cursed', 'lifeguard', 'catty', 'sister', 'Korean', 'couple', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'red-neck', 'jerk', 'who', 'stir', 'up', 'trouble', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'paraplegic', 'who', 'inexplicitly', 'regained', 'use', 'legs', 'island.There', 'are', 'usual', 'social', 'issues', 'mistrust', 'group', 'hunting', 'food', 'romantic', 'tension', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'etc', 'like', 'social', 'dramas', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'sustain', 'show', 'Lost', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'Deep', 'Dark', 'Secret', 'episode', 'based', 'particular', 'character', 'who', 'explored', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'reveal', 'past', 'life', 'circumstances', 'leading', 'up', 'boarding', 'fateful', 'plane.And', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'writers', 'also', 'throw', 'few', 'curveballs', 'unknown', 'nature', 'island', 'giant', 'creature', 'kind', 'already', 'chomped', 'down', 'few', 'people', 'series', 'ghostly', 'appearances', 'polar', 'bear', 'Yes', 'right', 'polar', 'bear', 'mysteries', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'something', 'amazingly', 'clever', 'utterly', 'stupid', 'remains', 'be', 'seen', 'way', 'unfolding', 'intriguing', 'spooky', 'show', 'creators', 'have', 'already', 'stated', 'master-plan', 'terms', 'gradually', 'infolding', 'mystery.Some', 'components', 'induce', 'eye-rolling', 'only', 'few', 'exceptions', 'survivors', 'are', 'very', 'attractive', 'great', 'physical', 'condition', 'writers', 'are', 'constantly', 'coming', 'up', 'new', 'ways', 'undress', 'One', 'particularly', 'innovative', 'episode', 'was', 'run-in', 'bee', 'nest', 'had', 'models', 'rushing', 'tearing', 'clothes', 'off', 'frenzy', 'show', 'fascination', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'can', 'underlying', 'theme', 'fate', 'main', 'characters', 'together', 'flashbacks', 'hint', 'uncanny', 'connection', 'characters', 'example', 'one', 'character', 'unknowingly', 'conversation', 'character', 'father', 'box', 'factory', 'works', 'continuity', 'drawn', 'out', 'immense', 'care.It', 'intriguing', 'connection', 'characters', 'ongoing', 'mystery', 'care', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'Lost', 'compulsive', 'viewing']",Lost - The Complete First Season

Morris ""Rob & Matt Morris""","[7, 7]","Okay, if a TV show can be this good, why can't Hollywood, with its gargantuan budget, come anywhere close in terms of acting, script, cinematography, or give viewers the sheer joy of watching a complex plot unfold with over a dozen deep and conflicted characters?  The answer--because Hollywood doesn't take risks.  This show never should have been a success, according to the Establishment, whose philosophy is: Go with the sure thing.  Has there been one original movie in the last two years?  If so, better make twenty more just like it, say the film companies.  It seems like every mainstream movie anymore is a rip-off of a teenage sex comedy, a crime thriller, a car-chase show, or a drama about disfunctional, unrealistic, and unlikeable families.  As for the TV market, the prevailing view seems to be 'why pay actors high salaries when you can find idiots to be on reality television for free?'LOST gets back to what real entertainment should be.  Give the viewer an intriguing story line that is not predictable, excellent three-dimensional characters, each with a deep, dark secret or a tragic flaw, put the cast on a beautiful, deserted island to create a micro-society, throw in a mysterious villain or villains, and you have all the elements necessary to create a show that will become as classic as the original Star Trek---quirky, thoughtful, well-acted, and just plain fun.Watching LOST is like viewing a tapestry in construction.

633079,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JNOG,Robert Moore,"[1031, 1160]","It is too early to state for certain just how good LOST is compared to the great shows in television history, but by the highest possible standards its first season has to stand out as one of the great seasons in the history of the medium.  Season One of LOST was not merely good but great television, and not merely great television but great narrative storytelling.  But the impact of LOST goes completely beyond its aesthetic success.  Along with another show on ABC (albeit one that I do not care for), DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, LOST has managed to cause the prodigiously stupid television execs to realize that there is a huge demand for quality scripted television.  After years of an endless string of simply awful reality shows, all of the networks suddenly want shows that are written ahead of time and feature casts of actual actors.  Although final schedules have not yet been announced, it looks as if the 2005-2006 season is going to have both a dramatic decrease in reality shows and an increase in scripted shows.  The stunning success of LOST has played a major role in this sea change.We have in recent years seen genre shows that were huge hits with critics and managed to generate a passionate cult following.  Probably no show was more critically praised than BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (with hordes of high brow critics preferring it to more respectable hit series like THE SOPRANOS), but at its peak it managed only a small audience.  LOST has generated critical praise almost as strong as BUFFY, a core of fans nearly as passionate, but unlike BUFFY managed absolutely stunning ratings.  It is one of the few instances in recent television history where what is arguably the best show on TV also managed among the strongest ratings.  In fact, LOST would be considered a cult show based on the number of websites that it has inspired and the passion of the fans, except that the ratings instead make it a mainstream hit.Who would have thought that a series dealing with plane crash survivors on a most unusual island would have been this successful?  Before it debuted I remember people joking that it sounded like GILLIGAN'S ISLAND without the humor.  But it ended up matching or surpassing the most optimistic expecations, in quality as well as in ratings.  The mention of ratings is not gratuitious.  So many superb shows have been cancelled in recent years (FIREFLY, WONDERFALLS, DEAD LIKE ME, ANGEL) that there was even a ""Save LOST"" website started . . . before the show even debuted!  Luckily, the ratings have made cancellation seem not only remote but impossible.It is almost impossible to acknowledge everything that LOST does well in the space allotted here.  Above all else, it is a superbly written show, not merely on an episode by episode basis, but in the way all of the episodes mesh with one another.  The continuity is the best that I have seen in a long time.  For instance, the first time we see one character in the show, she is rubbing her wrist.  Later, we learn that she had been a prisoner of a U. S. Marshall and had obviously gotten rid of her handcuffs just before we first met her.  Almost any detail like that will be dealt with at a later date.  But the scripts are just as strong on character development, humor, excitement, and adventure.  I do have a tiny bit of fear about Season Two:  former BUFFY and ANGEL writer David Fury, who wrote many of the finest scripts of the year, including ""Walkabout,"" which could very well win Fury an Emmy for best written episode of the year, has left LOST to work this summer on the new FOX series THE INSIDE, before joining 24 as a writer and executive producer.My initial fear when the show started was that the central cast was perhaps too large, but it turned out to be unjustified, and the great ensemble cast is unquestionably one of the reasons for the show's success..  Yes, there are a lot of characters, and sometimes I wish some were more central than others, but the depth and power of developing the stories of a dozen characters ended up being both unique and exceptionally entertaining.  Jack is the titular lead of the show, although show creator J. J. Abrams has confessed that their original idea was to have Jack assume leadership in the first couple of episodes, and then have him die off, forcing the lovely fugitive Kate become the leader for the castaways.  But they quickly realized that Matthew Fox's Jack was too valuable a character to toss aside so cavalierly.  If there is a second main character, it is Kate, who is performed by a remarkable newcomer, the excruciatingly beautiful Evangeline Lily, who despite virtually no prior experience (I did recently spot her in a very, very tiny role from the first season episode ""Kinetic"" on SMALLVILLE, where her only task is to kiss her supposed boyfriend).  One of the most consistently fascinating characters is John Locke, played by Terry O'Quinn, a veteran television actor familiar to anyone who has seen shows like ALIAS, THE X-FILES, MILLENIUM, and THE WEST WING.  Although he has always performed marvelously, LOST has made him a star.  Every one of the major characters has his or her own set of fans.  Naveen Andrews, for instance, a Londoner of Indian descent, has been a big hit playing Sayid, the former Iraqi soldier, as has Jorge Garcia as Hurley, the obese lottery winner who is as unlucky for others as he is lucky himself.  And while Dominic Monaghan shared in the enormous success of THE LORD OF THE RINGS playing one of the Hobbits, he has achieved more individual success as Charlie, the heroin-addicted bass player for the fictional band Driveshaft (one hit wonders famed for their song ""You All Everybody"").  So rabid are the show's fans that there are websites dedicated to Driveshaft.Structurally, the narrative shifts between the efforts of the survivors to adapt to and understand the island on which they are marooned and flashbacks that explain the personal history of each character.  Some people object to this, wishing instead that they focused exclusively on the events on the island, but I think that this is wrong.  If you focused merely on the events on the island, it would be only an adventure story, but through the flashbacks we learn so much about what makes the people tick that the series becomes as much a character study as an adventure.  By the end of the season, we get to know the characters so well that we can anticipate how they are going to respond to even the smallest events.  We learn very quickly that the island contains a host of mysteries, including invisible monsters whose location and function remain unknown until the end of the season (if we even understand them then), other inhabitants whose intentions seem both sinister and unknown, and a lone insane Frenchwoman named Danielle Rousseau.  But there is not much more than we know about the island.  Rousseau talks of the Black Rock, but it isn't what we expect when we finally see it.  And then there is the metal doorway that Locke discovers in the middle of the jungle.  How can it be opened and what lies behind the door?  By the end of the season many of the mysteries are explained, but more are left open-ended.LOST clearly has the potential to be one of the great series in the history of television.  The producers are highly ambitious, but so far their execution has matched their aspirations.  I read an interview with David Fury before the first episode aired in which he said they had a plot line that runs over several years, so their clearly is a well-conceived storyline.  I have only one concern with the show, and that is the executive producer and creator J. J. Abrams.  Although he has two prior hit shows, FELICITY and ALIAS, he has had some problems with taking his shows to higher levels.  What made BUFFY so extraordinary was that each year they managed to do something new and amazing, even if some fans were disappointed by some directions it headed.  But ALIAS has started to disappoint some fans by the fact that it hasn't progressed much beyond what it was in the first season.  Instead of doing strikingly new things, Abrams just tends to recycle the same general storyline.  And there has not been much of a payoff for all the focus on Ramaldi (for nonfans of ALIAS, a Renaissance genius whose artifacts provide much of the narrative force of the show).  Abrams clearly is brilliant at conceiving and initiating great shows, but he has not yet demonstrated that he is a great finisher in the way that Joss Whedon has.  I'm forever the optimist, and I believe that Abrams either will come to terms with this or the other creators and executive producers will help LOST get to a place that we will all find satisfying.Regardless of the future, this nonetheless is one of the most remarkable rookie seasons any television series has ever enjoyed.  I'll end with food for thought.  THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, and FARSCAPE, to name just a few shows, were much better in their second and third seasons than their first.  What if two years from now we are able to say the same of LOST?",5,An absolutely astonishing debut season,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,9106,"['too', 'early', 'state', 'certain', 'just', 'how',

633080,AK6DB4FVAVO3O,B00005JNOG,Robert North,"[13, 18]","Lost occupies two spaces simultaneously. The one space is an island, presumably somewhere in the Pacific, though if anything is for sure about this show, it is that one should never presume. The other space is the past lives - full of love, hate, revenge, regret - of the main characters. And in both cases, these characters are ""lost.""Like The X-Files, you are to believe that the creators of this series have it all figured out, that it all makes sense to them. Don't believe it. There are plenty of plot inconsistencies and oddities and elements that don't add up. One of the characters even points out some of these in an episode. But here's the kicker - Don't care. Because this is grand entertainment.In both spaces, Lost blends true human drama with the odd and seemingly supernatural, teetering on occasion on the brink of credibility and melodrama while never taking that last step. You will care about these people. You will want to see what happens next. You will hang on each detail about their past live and current predicament. And you won't care about the inconsistencies except to have something to chat about on Thursdays in the office.Like many of the great X-Files episodes, Lost episodes give you details that many never be explained absolutely. But the overall effect is emotional, deep, and lasting. With its humor, pathos, action, and creeps, Lost is a show as much felt as watched. Some of it is visceral, and the show features many ""beautiful people"" and tough action. Some of it is almost whimsical, such as during the golf matches. Much of it is poignant with plenty of melancholy thrown in.I'm not saying that you should turn your brain off - much of the fun is trying to figure things out. (Note, that's ""trying"" to figure them out, not ""actually"" figuring them out.) What I am saying is that you shouldn't spend so much time evaluating the wine that you forget to enjoy it when it's in your mouth. Lost is fun and fascinating - and almost always mesmerizing.

Somehow this series manages to avoid all of the pitfalls that usually lead to the downfall of a television series.  The acting is first-rate and the storylines are engrossing and vibrant.  This is an imaginative show that constitutes first-rate entertainment.The theme is simple yet subtle.  A plane headed from Sydney Australia to Los Angeles USA goes off-course and crashes on an uninhabited island in the Pacific.  There are 41 survivors.  There are many strange things about the island, to put it mildly, and these anomalies become increasingly apparent as the story unfolds. (The most obvious anomaly is that it becomes apparent very shortly that there is little prospect of rescue.)  Further, there are connections between the passengers that most of them were unaware of.  The use of flashbacks concerning each of the principal characters is brilliantly done, and this often misused device is devastatingly effective here and serves to weave the story together.  The overall effect is a series that is incredibly absorbing and addictive.  The basic theme of the story, subtly recurring is ""Don't tell me what I can't do...!""The acting is first rate.  Matthew Fox as Dr. Jack Sheppard is particularly good, but many of the others are also superb.  Naveen Andrews as Sayid is an especial favorite of mine, as are Harold Perrineau as Michael and Evangeline Lilly as Kate.  Every viewer will have his or her own favorites. As the series progressed I found myself liking Jorge Garcia as ""Hurley"" more and more.Rarely has television succeeded in producing a series of such quality.  Highly recommended.

633084,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JNOG,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 3]","A series of strange, perhaps unfortunate yet momentous twists of fate unite the survivors of Oceanic Ft. 815.  Bound for LAX, the widebody makes an unexpected and fatal detour to a tropical island unknown.  Slightly over 40 survivors must now contend with the prospect that they may not be rescued.  Worse, the island offers small, yet unmistakable hints that it's far more than off the beaten track - in the first several episodes alone, we meet a hungry polar bear, an even hungrier thing that isn't even visible (unlike its gruesome leftovers) and we overhear a taped broadcast message that repeats a desperate plea for rescue twice every minute.  (An eerily robotic voice counts down how many iterations have already played - with a bit of arithmetic, the transmission is proved to be about 16 years old.)  As the survivors learn the secrets of the island, we learn their secrets through flashbacks - often overlapping with each other but sometimes repeating the same moments from a different POV.  We begin to wonder if the survivors can escape the island, but also whether the island is their escape.This is an unmissable show for so many reasons.  First off, we don't know what kind of story we're in - is it simply surreal?  Sci-fi?  Is there some supernatural aspect to the story?  Is it some government conspiracy?  The producers behind flunked shows tend to excuse their failures by saying they never settled on just what they wanted their show to be.  ""Lost"" skillfully and deftly writes that search for identity into its very core - we spend whole episodes peeling away layers of the island and the survivors - the beautiful yet treacherous Kate, the heroic yet torn Jack, the seemingly mercenary Sawyer, Syed, who was a ""communications officer"" in Saddam Hussein's Iraq...and then there's Locke (Terry Quinn) whom the island has changed instantly.  The show sticks to a common theme - whether life is determined by fate or free-choice - with Locke and Jack taking opposite poles.  The show moves at a glacial pace, often weaving the characters' back stories into the larger mystery of the island.  (This is best displayed in the episode ""Numbers"" in which we learn that Hurley, a seemingly slow witted slacker, is actually worth hundreds of millions; the secrets to his success revolve around a set of numbers that bring him great luck, and disaster to everybody else.)

Okay, now the DVDs are out.  I finished season 1, and now I am starting season 2.A plane crashes on an apparently deserted island (North Shore, Oahu).  The survivors are an eclectic bunch, all imperfect in some way, and as the season professes, you learn the stories of these survivors prior to getting on this plane.  There is a lot of running through the forest, of getting mad and punching and each other, and of foraging alliances.  The island proves to have a number of mysteries, and the survivors learn that they are not alone.What would you do if you crashed on an island?  Well, this group never seems put together a search party to go around the island (you would soon discover if there is civilization or not).  They let people ""steal"" or accumulate material from the crash site.  They just don't seem to behave in ways that are reasonable given their situation.But, of course, the island has a number of mysteries, from ""the Others"" to a hidden hatch to a... well, I can't go into detail, because discovery is what Lost is about.So it is okay, but I'm really hoping it picks up in season 2.

633089,A1ZIIC262XVX19,B00005JNOG,Russ,"[5, 5]","I am one of the few people that does not watch Lost on prime time TV. Unlike most, I waited until Season One was released on DVD in order to keep up with the story arc. A few warnings are below.Warning #1: Season One can cause alcohol problems. Since my motto is ""have a few beers and enjoy,"" I did that very thing after I put the kids to bed and settled into my chair to screen the first episode around eight in the evening. I reached a point some time around one in the morning that I had to force myself to turn off the TV and pass out. This was only after telling myself, ""Okay, just one more episode, then I'll go to bed"" for several episodes.Warning #2: Season One causes sleep deprivation. Because I stayed up too late ""having a few beers"" the first night (the end of each episode ended in a way that I kept saying, ""I can't stop now...I gotta know what happens next""), I was beat-down tired the next day. After going all day of telling myself to be in bed early, where did I find myself at approximately eight that evening? In my chair, beer in hand, having to re-watch the last several episodes from the night before, tired as heck, and knowing better than to go through with this debacle. Yet there I was.Warning #3: Season One causes memory loss. After averaging a ""couple of beers"" an episode, the later episodes viewed in a screening get a little fuzzy.

The mysterious events that happen on the island may make pepole want to know what is next, but they are never solved because the producers want to make the show run for at least another 3 seasons and they have to keep the audience waiting because it is obvious that they don't have much to tell.And whatever the explanation for the mysteries may be, nobody will be satisfied because everybody is now expecting too much!This show could have been good without all these flashbacks which keep you waiting and waiting...

Because watching LOST truly transcends the screen; once you start to attach to the many excellent characters, watching their trials and tribulations on this, at times claustrophobic, at times vast and desolate but ALWAYS intriguing island becomes something of a religious experience.The character development is relentless, each episode powerfully reveals the backstory and possible motives for each character's actions on the island, while the first real connection you're likely to draw is that almost everyone suffered in some way. This show has a way of humanizing even the most derelict or seemingly outcast characters, and just as Jack says in one of the early episodes ""everyone deserves a fresh start here.""But all the best character development in the world could only take the show so far, fortunately this show goes FAR BEYOND ""interesting people crash on an island, fight the impulses to devolve into primal anarchy, ""live together, or die alone,"" and into this complicated web of mythology and paranormal phenomenon that constantly causes the viewer to go, ""What!?"" and then pulls you, faster and faster down the rabbit hole.I could go on and on about just how great and what a tremendous impact this show will have on the viewer, for all the reasons above and many more, but my best advice is to watch this show for yourself and see first hand why this could be one of the greatest television shows of all time.

Assistant Director, an inmate in a wheelchair, a gay-basher turned gay homosexual, a surfer chick and Jay Leno get on a plane. Well if you sprinkle in some token hot chicks, you'll have one of the most talked about shows in recent memory. (Bonus points to anyone who guesses who's who. Leave your guesses in the comment section with the character and the show/movie.)The first episode of Lost rivaled that of a big budget, a plane crash, an enormous monster, an exotic location and of course, the hottest token hot chick on TV today. It was compelling enough to become an instant water cooler topic. We all debated what the monster was, who would be the first to die, and where exactly where were they.Then the show moved into its ""Back-story of the Week"" format where we learned that Kate was a wanted woman and that of course raised more questions. What exactly did she do? From there, we saw flashback from each of the main characters, so more than others. We saw some that were absolutely shocking (Locke was in a wheelchair). We saw some that were easy to predict (Boone and Shannon are siblings by marriage and have hooked up). We saw some that were funny (Hurley's bad luck).By the time the finale rolls around, everyone is more confused than Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton in the celebrity spelling bee. But since the producers are so nice, we get a glimpse of the monster. Umm, it's just black smoke. We are supposed to be scared of that? Well at least we get to see who the Others are. But that turned out to another let down as they looked like extras from Deliverance. If they force Hurley to squeal like a pig in his underwear next season, I will never watch the show again. So after the Other signaled that they have selected a new pope, they hop on their boat to pick up Walt. But I thought they were supposed to use white smoke for that, but anyway.There were a lot of flaws that could be found in the writing. During Sayid's second flashback, it's been well documented that terrorist that are strapped with explosives do not detonate the bombs, they are led to believe they do but are followed and some one else does it just in case the suicide bomber gets second thoughts. Also how could the explosives expert, Artz, explode after picking up one stick but the people that don't know anything about it can carry six sticks threw the jungle without incident? Not to mention, why has no one mentioned that Locke is no in a wheelchair. I'm sure some one noticed he was in a wheelchair before the flight then being carried onto the plane by the flight attendants. These little details bug me a little everyone and a while and takes me out of the story.The bigger problem though is the amount of unanswered questions that each episode leaves such as (my theories are in parentheses):What did Kate do that was so bad that her mom is scared of her? (Eco-terrorist blamed for the death of an oil tycoon.)How did Locke get in the wheelchair? (Complications to surgery.)What is the monster? (A specter.)What is the hatch to? (A submarine.)What happened to Rose? (She went looking for her husband around the island.)Why did the fortune teller change his mind about Claire keeping her baby? (The fortune teller didn't change his mind. There is no couple in LA. He saw another castaway's future and made Claire get on that flight.)Who was Ethan Rom and why did he want Claire? (One of the others looking for the chosen one.)How did Claire escape someone who could capture two people at one time? (She didn't escape, she was let go after it was realized that her child wasn't the chosen one.)How did Jack single handedly beat up Ethan Rom after be beaten like a red headed step child days earlier? (Ethan let him win.)Why would Sayid hook up with Shannon after being so close to finding his true love? (I, personally forget about any past loves if I had a chance with Shannon.)What's with the number? (Just a way to connect everyone and everything.)What did the French chick say to Hurley to calm him down? (Haven't a clue.)Why did Claire name here kid Aaron? If she lost all her memory, what could the significance of this be? (I think the writers screwed up.)What do the Others want with Walt? (He can control the monster.)What will happen to Michael, Sawyer & Jin? (They will float back to the island and will discover the other survivors like Rose's husband and Michelle Rodriguez.)What will Jack and company find down the hatch? (Boone, Ethan Rom, the marshal, Scott and anyone else who died.)Why is a flight from Australia carrying so many non-Australians? By my count there is only one Australian that we have met, Claire.

633096,A3FNZQU6KBXWLM,B00005JNOG,Scott Delo,"[10, 10]","Last season my friends urged me to watch this show and I didn't listen. I don't watch a lot of television anymore. Other than sports, there never seems to be much good on. I figured this show would be a sappy cross between a nighttime soap and Survivor, with beautiful people posturing on the beach.Nothing could be further from the truth. This show is an existentialist masterpiece. A group of unrelated people are stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific when their plane goes down. Nobody comes for them and they have to survive on their own. To make matters worse, strange things seem to be happening on the island. Creatures they can't quite see, but which are big and strong enough to knock down trees, chase after them when they venture too far into the jungle. To top it all off, the survivors have carried as much emotional baggage onto the island as they have regular baggage.Besides the happenings on the island, each week the show flashes back to the past of one of the major characters. This makes the show as much a character study as it is anything else. I like how the characters are shown as fully developed people rather than the melodramatic heroes and villains you find in most series. There is an Asian couple from the old school. The husband is very strict with his wife but you can see how deeply he loves her. The protagonist, played by Mathew Fox, is a pretty good guy but he's got his issues too. By far, the most fascinating character in the show is the enigmatic John Locke. Locke alternates between noble and creepy. In many ways, he personifies the island and the show.Every once in a while I'll come across a movie or novel that captures my imagination and I can't wait to get back to it. Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Matrix come to mind for movies. The best of King, Grisham and Clancy come to mind for novels. Someone will ask me if I can recommend something and after I do, I'll envy that person for the incredible journey they are about to take.

Many of my favorite shows (Boom Town, Wonder Falls, Firefly) from earlier seasons have sufferered premature demsies brought on by short sighted networks.  Judging the response to the first season of Lost I think that we will have our mysterious island for quite a while yet.First and foremost Lost is a psychological drama, built around an enormously talented and diverse ensemble cast.  They are stranded on an island and confronted with situations that range from the mundane to the truly bizarre (polar bears and an unseen monstrous entity for instance).  Each episode highlights an individual character and uses flash backs to pivotal events in their past that inform their current actions.  These flash backs and the ongoing story line mesh to reveal the nature of the characters, and pieces to the puzzle that is the mystery of the island.Standout characters include Jack, a heroic surgeon afflicted by blind stubborness and guilt; Kate, a beautiful women of many talents and a dark past; Charlie, a strung-out, burnt-out, has-been rock star looking for a purpose in his life; Locke, a man who embraces the strangeness of the island and is duly rewarded; Sayid, a one time Republican Guard Intelligence officer seeking redemption; Sawyer, a sarcastic, self-loathing con-man with a heart of... well that would be telling; and Hurley, huge, good-hearted, optimistic and very funny.  Other characters have yet to be fully fleshed, but I looking forward to seeing more of Michael, Walt, Sun, Jin, Shannon and Claire in the next season.Overall, Lost is an experience that I could not recommend more strongly.  With production values, writing, directing and acting all better than most movies; this sprawling, novel for television is also one of the most daring and innovative series to come along in a long time.",5,"An intense, character driven thriller that hits all the right marks...",1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,1927,"['pleasant', 'surprise', 'come', 'network', 'television', 'immensely', 'good', 'immensely', 'popular', 'Many', 'favorite', 'shows', 'Boom', 'Town', 'Wonder', 'Falls', 'Firefly', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'have', 'sufferered', 'premature', 'demsies', 'brought', 'short', 'sighted', 'networks', 'Judging', 'response', 'first', 'season', 'Lost', 'think', 'will', 'have', 'mysterious', 'island', 'quite', 'while', 'yet.First', 'foremost', 'Lost', 'psychological', 'drama', 'built', 'enormously', 'talented', 'diverse', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'are', 'stranded', 'island', 'confronted', 'situations', 'range', 'mundane', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'polar', 'bears', 'unseen', 'monstrous', 'entity', 'instance', 'episode', 'individual', 'character', 'flash', 'backs', 'pivotal', 'events', 'past', 'inform', 'current', 'actions', 'flash', 'backs', 'ongoing', 'story', 'line', 'mesh', 'reveal', 'nature', 'characters', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'mystery', 'island.Standout', 'characters', 'include', 'Jack', 'heroic', 'surgeon', 'afflicted', 'blind', 'stubborness', 'guilt', 'Kate', 'beautiful', 'women', 'many', 'talents', 'dark', 'past', 'Charlie', 'strung-out', 'burnt-out', 'has-been', 'rock', 'star', 'looking', 'purpose', 'life', 'Locke', 'man', 'who', 'strangeness', 'island', 'duly', 'rewarded', 'Sayid', 'one', 'time', 'Republican', 'Guard', 'Intelligence', 'officer', 'seeking', 'redemption', 'Sawyer', 'sarcastic', 'self-loathing', 'con-man', 'heart', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'telling', 'Hurley', 'huge', 'good-hearted', 'optimistic', 'very', 'funny', 'Other', 'characters', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'Michael', 'Walt', 'Sun', 'Jin', 'Shannon', 'Claire', 'next', 'season.Overall', 'Lost', 'experience', 'could', 'not', 'recommend', 'more', 'strongly', 'production', 'values', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'better', 'most', 'movies', 'sprawling', 'novel', 'television', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'daring', 'innovative', 'series', 'come', 'along', 'long', 'time']",Lost - The Complete First Season

And by the time I was ready to take it on, the world was already multiple seasons in and everyone was telling me that this was the kind of show you had to see from the beginning to fully grasp. As a result, I missed every last episode which ever aired on TV.Recently, however, the entire series became available on Netflix Instant and I decided to give it a go. Needless to say I got through the first season in one weekend. That should speak to just how engrossing this show is once complete the first episode; especially when you consider that the first season contains more than 20 episodes, each weighing in at around 45 minutes. I simply could not stop watching.Nearly everything you want to imagine saying in favor of a show is present here. All of your emotional strings will be pulled, the cast is perfect, the plot is magnificently spun and slowly untangled; a mystery ever-deepening, but satisfying nonetheless. The only real negative I have to point to is the very beginning of the series. It is jarring. But I suppose that's to be expected when a tale is begun with the aftermath of a plane crash. And we're only talking about the first 5 minutes of a massive amount of running time.Even when you factor in just how easy this show is to get wrapped up in, no matter what category of entertainment you enjoy, we still haven't hit on the fact that the asking price of this set is wildly affordable when one realizes just how many hours of entertainment this is going to provide you in return. This is not only something I would recommend. This is a must-have, period. Even though I have full access to watch this on Netflix, I still intend to purchase season one on dvd.

633108,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B00005JNOG,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","Ranking up there with great movies, Lost has redefined the scope and quality of what you can do with a live-action television series and is easily one of the best tv smashes of all time.  The viewing experience is enhanced greatly through the boxed sets as opposed to watching an hour a week on the regular broadcasts - widescreen high-definition shows uninterrupted by commercials, with the ability to watch several episodes in a night, and, if you wish, an entire season in a relatively short span.  And at a price like this (listed at just $16.99 as I'm writing this), this is just too good a value to pass up for anyone who doesn't own the sets yet.  Note: the 'rewatch' quality of Lost is a lot higher than with a lot of other cases, as seeing earlier episodes with the hindsight of knowing how those early events tie into later developments, just makes for a great experience.  If you haven't started the Lost series, or have only seen sporadic episodes, it's much better to start off from the beginning and see everything in order than just jumping right into where the tv show is at now.  That would be kind of like starting an epic novel at page 700 and trying to figure out what's going on.The basic premise of Lost is well-known by now and simple: a commercial airliner crashlands on an uncharted tropical island and the survivors have to try and carry on, keep themselves alive until rescue comes or try to find a way off the island themselves.  How the story actually unfolds, of course, is anything but simple.  The first, double-length episode is a perfect example.  For almost its whole running time, it focuses as if it were, in fact, just that simple: the survivors, confused, afraid, and sometimes injured, try to survive in the immediate wake of the crash, with chaos reigning and the plane wreckage still aflame.  People have to come together very quickly.  It's only after things have settled down, that night, at the very end of the pilot episode, that the first real sign comes to the survivors and the viewers that things aren't as cut and dried as they might seem, with the classic view of what happens off in the jungle (which I'm not going to spoil here for anybody who hasn't seen it).Also in the first episode, the flashbacks begin to the lives of the various passengers before they boarded the plane.  The continuing flashback usage was seen by some as annoying, and even I initially thought they might be over-using it just a bit, but you realize later on how vital everything is and how it all ties together.  In fact, it may be less accurate to view Lost as a story being told, with the help of a lot of flashbacks; than to view it as a story that's being told in more than one time frame simultaneously.  I'd seen this technique used in comic books and some movies (it's since become more prevalent in movies than it was) but I don't know if any ongoing tv series had ever tried to do this before Lost.Few of the passengers know each other before the crash, and the initial episodes focus a lot on the early day-to-day survival, the early forming of friendships, sometimes the seeds of relationships, and in some cases rivalries and enmities.  Some of the characters come into this with volatile personalities (yes, that includes Sawyer), others (like Jack and Hurley) ty in different ways to act as the glue that will hold the fledging group together, some (like Kate and Sayid) have secret pasts that will figure into things after a while, and some, most notably John Locke, quickly come up with their own, sometimes way off-the-beaten-path, ideas of what the group's priorities and long-term goals should be.Clues begin coming that make it more evident that things aren't as simple as a plane accidentally coming down on an uncharted island.  For starters, it quickly becomes apparant that the island is awfully Large for something that's supposedly not on any map.  Things happen that would seem to indicate that the survivors aren't the only ones on the island, and other things seem strangely out of place, even unnatural.  The first seeds of the idea that it isn't coincidence that this particular group of strangers has come to be on this island at this time, are planted, as Locke comes up with a lot of ideas concerning fate.  And the season continues on to a spectacular cliffhanger season finale, which will become the standard with the show.  Lost looks and feels like an extra-long big budget movie, but one of the well-written, well-executed big budget movies, not a movie with high budget but low in other factors.  One of the most skillful things about the overall series is how some seemingly minor incident will happen, and only much later (sometimes several seasons later) be revealed as tying into other events in a big way.Lost got me to re-asses television shows as a whole.  I don't watch a lot of tv programming as opposed to the number of DVDs I watch, but Lost opened me up to the idea that there might be some good stuff on there I was missing.  I like the boxed sets of series better than seeing the regular broadcasts with their commercials and with there often being several weeks between episodes.  Renting disc one of a series and then buying the box set if disc one was good enough seems like a good way to go about it.  But even as I've become more familiar with some of what's been on tv, and enjoy some of it a lot, there are still relatively few programs past or present that can come close to Lost.  This is up there among my favorite movies, or favorite stories from any other medium (comics, novels, etc.).

633109,AEZ4DZCUL021H,B00005JNOG,Stephen,"[0, 0]","I've gotten through the season and I'm impressed about this tale about 48 survivors (only about 10 are lead ones) who survive a plane crash and try to make it through a mysterious Island with what looks like a huge creature who is just waiting to gobble them up whole. Mix in some boars and polar bears, a mysterious french woman (I KNOW I SEEN HER BEFORE!!!--I JUST FORGET WHERE FROM!! I WAS REWINDING IT SEVERAL TIMES TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT AND I STILL DON'T REMEMBER...GRRRR..), some weird black mist, a mysterious hatch, among others and then somehow managed to mash it into a hit. After the first couple of episodes, I was hooked.I would rather have them not that french woman in the series (even though she playes a part), it kinda ruined the mystery behind her. The only thing I can say that is a little bit off (not bad, mind you) is the music after the episode is over. Sometimes it dosn't mesh well (like with the episodes in which is a more ""feel-good"" type). I admit, the 2nd pilot ending (the transmission realization), and the ""whispers"" ending SCARED THE CRAP OUTTA ME!!! I loved those endings to the episodes. Those are the ones in which I HAD to watch the next one in place of something else such as sleeping, eating, etc.I need to see what happens to a ""certain characters"" and I got to see what's the mystery behind the hatch and the big beast that no one seems to see (or the producers keep teasing us by angling the camera a different way...grrrr)The noice made by the mysterious creature was interesting as well.

That's a drive that is still going strong waiting for the final season this January. The first season is my favorite just because there is so much mystery. Nothing is known of these characters when they crash, but you quickly bond with them and began to understand what makes them tick. There are flashbacks in every episode that helps fill in the backstory of each character. The island is a mystery that you and the survivors attempt to figure out. There are tons of plot twists and mysteries to keep you on the edge of your seat. LOST is filled with mystery, drama, comedy, and suspense. There are tons of characters that help develope the plot. As they try to investigate the island you attempt to figure them out. LOST is the best show on TV. The writting never stops to amaze and shock you. The cast never misses a beat either. They are on top of their game at all times. If you haven't seen LOST pick this blu ray up today you won't be disappointed. This show stabs you in the jugular and doesn't let go.Also the blu ray looks amazing. LOST is shot digitally and is the best looking show on Blu Ray. I had the first season prior to this on DVD, and I still am going to pick up the entire series on Blu Ray next year. This is a great series that has the best writting staff and cast on TV.

Abrams, the creator of Alias, and Damon Lindelof (Crossing Jordan) comes an action-packed adventure that will bring out the very best and the very worst in the people who are lost.Out of the blackness, the first thing Jack (Matthew Fox, Party of Five) senses is pain. Then burning sun. A Bamboo forest. Smoke. Screams. With a rush comes the horrible awareness that the plane he was on tore apart in mid-air and crashed on a Pacific island. From there it's a blur, as his doctor's instinct kicks in: people need his help. Stripped of everything, the 48 survivors scavenge what they can from the plane for their survival. Some panic. Some pin their hopes on rescue. A few find inner strength they never knew they had -- like Kate (Evangeline Lilly), who, with no medical training, suddenly finds herself suturing the doctor's wounds. Hurley (Jorge Garcia) - a man with a warm sense of humor despite the desperate situation - does his best to keep his cool as he helps those around him to survive. Charlie (Dominic Monaghan, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring trilogy) is a faded rock star who harbors a painful secret. Sayid (Naveen Andrews, The English Patient) is a Middle Eastern man who must wrestle with the racial profiling directed at him by some of his fellow survivors. Jin (Daniel Dae Kim, Spider-Man 2, 24) and Sun (Yunjin Kim) are a Korean couple whose traditions, values and language are foreign and thus causes much to get lost in the translation. Sawyer (Josh Holloway) has an air of danger surrounding him, and his intense sense of mistrust for everyone around him could prove to be fatal to his fellow castaways. Michael (Harold Perrineau, Oz) has just gained custody of his nine-year-old son, Walt (Malcolm David Kelley, Antwone Fisher, You Got Served), after the death of his ex-wife - they are a father and son who don't even know each other. Locke (Terry O'Quinn, Alias, Primal Fear) is a mysterious man who keeps to himself, and who harbors a deeper connection to the island than any of the others. And self-centered Shannon (Maggie Grace, Oliver Beene) - who actually gives herself a pedicure amid the chaos - and her estranged controlling brother, Boone (Ian Somerhalder, Smallville) - constantly bicker and must learn to get along if they are to survive. The band of friends, family, enemies and strangers must work together against the cruel weather and harsh terrain if they want to stay alive. But the island holds many secrets, including the intense howls of the mysterious creatures stalking the jungle, which fill them all with fear. Fortunately, thanks to the calm leadership of quick-thinking Jack and level-headed Kate, they have hope. But even heroes have secrets, as the survivors will come to learn. This show is awesome it is absolutly perfect!I know it's a little  early to be thinking but It would be so cool if they made a movie.  If there is going to be as many special features as they are predicting this will be the DVD of the year.Special Features:* The original pilot* Behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the show* Audio commentaries* Blooper reel* Roundtable discussions with cast and crew* A Matthew Fox photography featurette* Deleted scenes* Casting tapes* New, original ""mini-movie"" that reveals why the plane crashed.(REMEMBER THESE ARE JUST RUMORS, NOT FACT)Also, interested in seeing the cover art?

633119,A32YEDSNWE78RS,B00005JNOG,T. Davis,"[10, 12]","Lost was easily the best show of the 2004-2005 TV season, and one of the better shows to debut in the last 10 years or so. By now everyone knows the premise. What makes the show great is the amazing cast and film-worthy production values. Each week couldn't come fast enough and when watching an episode, the hour flew by leaving you breathless and wanting more - pretty much everything you could ask for from an hour long network drama. Yeah drama, that's right. It does have elements of fantasy & sci-fi, but they're just devices to put the characters into situations where they can really shine. Lost is a character study and is at its best in the quiet moments in between the mechanical/black-shadow beast and the hatch to God-knows-where. It's interesting to see where these people are in their lives on the island, what came before, and where they are headed as individuals and as a group. There really isn't a single uninteresting one in the whole bunch.As far as the DVD goes - every studio and production company take note: this is how it's done. Just as the special editions of Lord of the Rings are the benchmark of Movie DVDs, Lost represents the best of TV DVDs. Excellent commentary (with asides -great feature) and great docs/bonus content. It's a seven DVD set (25 hours just of the actual show excluding extras) and you get it for less than $40. This is one of the best values out there. HBO DVD take note: $100 for a 13 ep run is a rip off.If you're a fan, buy it. If you haven't seen Lost yet or are intimidated by a show with an arc that demands you pay attention from week-to-week, show-to-show, and rewards you with fine escapist entertainment - Buy It Now... you won't be sorry, don't miss out on a wonderful and intelligent show.NOTE: Some fans have complained that the first season finale didn't answer enough questions and raised new ones - Welcome to serialized TV. What did you expect? They weren't gonna blow their wad at the end of only one season. Yeah I want answers too but having a little patience and trusting that the writers know what they're doing is all part of the experience. Relax, season two is only weeks away and in just like no time the new eps will fly by and we'll all be wondering what the hell is going to happen in season three.Note 2: Season four just ended and after a few stumbles in seasons 2 and the first part of 3, Lost is better than it has ever been. If you ditched out of frustration or for whatever reason, do yourself a favor and catch up on all the episodes because season 4 is right on par with season 1. Answers have been given and the plot is lean and progressing nicely. Plus, Lost is the only show that hasn't seem to diminish in quality since the writers strike. Lost is currently the most compelling show on TV right now.",5,Lost - Currently the best on network TV,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,2792,"['Lost', 'was', 'easily', 'best', 'show', '2004-2005', 'TV', 'season', 'one', 'better', 'shows', 'debut', 'last', '10', 'years', 'so', 'now', 'everyone', 'premise', 'What', 'show', 'great', 'amazing', 'cast', 'film-worthy', 'production', 'values', 'week', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'fast', 'enough', 'when', 'watching', 'episode', 'hour', 'flew', 'leaving', 'breathless', 'wanting', 'more', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'could', 'ask', 'hour', 'long', 'network', 'drama', 'Yeah', 'drama', 'right', 'have', 'elements', 'fantasy', 'sci-fi', ""'re"", 'just', 'devices', 'put', 'characters', 'situations', 'where', 'can', 'really', 'shine', 'Lost', 'character', 'study', 'best', 'quiet', 'moments', 'mechanical/black-shadow', 'beast', 'hatch', 'God-knows-where', 'interesting', 'see', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'lives', 'island', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'where', 'are', 'headed', 'individuals', 'group', 'really', ""n't"", 'single', 'uninteresting', 'one', 'whole', 'bunch.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'studio', 'production', 'company', 'take', 'note', 'how', 'done', 'Just', 'special', 'editions', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'are', 'benchmark', 'Movie', 'DVDs', 'Lost', 'best', 'TV', 'DVDs', 'Excellent', 'commentary', 'asides', '-great', 'feature', 'great', 'docs/bonus', 'content', 'seven', 'DVD', 'set', '25', 'hours', 'just', 'actual', 'show', 'excluding', 'extras', 'get', 'less', '40', 'one', 'best', 'values', 'out', 'there', 'HBO', 'DVD', 'take', 'note', '100', '13', 'ep', 'run', 'rip', 'off.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'buy', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Lost', 'yet', 'are', 'intimidated', 'show', 'arc', 'pay', 'attention', 'week-to-week', 'show-to-show', 'rewards', 'fine', 'escapist', 'entertainment', 'Now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'out', 'wonderful', 'intelligent', 'show.NOTE', 'fans', 'have', 'complained', 'first', 'season', 'finale', 'did', ""n't"", 'answer', 'enough', 'questions', 'raised', 'new', 'ones', 'Welcome', 'serialized', 'TV', 'What', 'did', 'expect', 'were', ""n't"", 'gon', 'blow', 'wad', 'end', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'Yeah', 'want', 'answers', 'too', 'having', 'little', 'patience', 'trusting', 'writers', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'part', 'experience', 'Relax', 'season', 'two', 'only', 'weeks', 'away', 'just', 'time', 'new', 'eps', 'will', 'fly', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wondering', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'happen', 'season', 'three.Note', '2', 'Season', 'four', 'just', 'ended', 'few', 'stumbles', 'seasons', '2', 'first', 'part', '3', 'Lost', 'better', 'ever', 'been', 'ditched', 'frustration', 'reason', 'do', 'favor', 'catch', 'up', 'episodes', 'season', '4', 'right', 'par', 'season', '1', 'Answers', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'plot', 'lean', 'progressing', 'nicely', 'Lost', 'only', 'show', ""n't"", 'seem', 'diminish', 'quality', 'writers', 'strike', 'Lost', 'currently', 'most', 'compelling', 'show', 'TV', 'right', 'now']",Lost - The Complete First Season

As Jack Sheppard (Fox) awakens to find that the plan has crashed and that survivors are laying on the sand dying, he is thrown into command mode making his character both a hero and a martyr.The supporting cast as a great seedy background too.  For example Kate Ryan (Evangeline Lilly) was on the plan with a U.S. Marshall, why? Nobody knows.  Then there is Charlie, the lead singer of Drive Shaft who has a drug problem.  Also on the plane is Claire, who is about six or seven months pregnant when the plane crashes.  John Locke is another survivor who was being sent home after he was turned away from a nature walk in Australia.  A comic relief to the show is Hurley, who thinks that he is cursed becaused he played the lotto with certain numbers.Throughout season one the survivors try to find shelter, build a raft, and encounter a French woman named Danielle Rosseau.  Danielle keeps warning the survivors that their are others on this island and shows up in the series periodically from time to time to warn them.There is also a supernatural component to the story, such as when Jack, Charlie, and Claire stumble across the cockpit.  They find that the ill-fated piolot is still inside, and as the piolot tells them that they are about 200 miles off course a monster eats him.With so much exitment in this one show, it is likely to be around for a while.

633123,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B00005JNOG,Thayer,"[3, 3]","This is one of the most engrossing series in recent memory. Whether it involves the island drama as the characters encounter mysterious things after mysterious things or the back story of each character being revealed through flashbacks. I think that the show's format sustained the cohesiveness of the show since while maintaining solid major storylines in the island, the writers were able to explore a plethora of possibilities for each character in the flashbacks.Here are my top 5 episodes of the season:******** Possible Spoiler**********1. House of the Rising Sun - It's brave to have an episode where the main characters speak a foreign language that involves juicy storyline (and not that involves terrorist plots). And it totally works, this is the most moving and affectionate episode of the season in my opinion. Yunjin Kim gave a heartbreaking performance. The airport scene was pitch perfect.2. ... In Translation - a great companion to the House of the Rising Sun. We get to see the same story through the point of view of Jin (played by Daniel Dae Kim who gave a really great performance). This is also an episode where the island drama is as central as the flashbacks3. Do No Harm - Matthew Fox acted every scene he's in with intensity, sincerity, subtlety, and emotional depth that makes me really mad he was not nominated in this year's Emmy.4. Exodus (Part1) - an episode that moves the story along. A poignant episode that served as a setup (and in itself a great episode) for the finale as major storylines in the past that were untouched reemerged.5. Walkabout - A well written episode that gave some insights (and answers that probably we didn't even ask) to the mysterious Locke. It was just brilliant how the puzzle was put together through camera close ups and nuanced reactions and movements in the plane crash flashbackActually my personal top 5 episodes do not give justice in representing the very best episodes of the series since there are other standout episodes that could've easily been on that list (Outlaws, White Rabbit, Raised by Another, Pilot, Exodus Part 2 and 3 etc.).Grade: A",5,Lost: First Season,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,2120,"['one', 'most', 'engrossing', 'series', 'recent', 'memory', 'island', 'drama', 'characters', 'encounter', 'mysterious', 'things', 'mysterious', 'things', 'back', 'story', 'character', 'being', 'revealed', 'flashbacks', 'think', 'show', 'format', 'sustained', 'cohesiveness', 'show', 'maintaining', 'solid', 'major', 'storylines', 'island', 'writers', 'were', 'able', 'explore', 'plethora', 'possibilities', 'character', 'flashbacks.Here', 'are', 'top', '5', 'episodes', 'season', '********', 'Possible', 'Spoiler**********1', 'House', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'brave', 'have', 'episode', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'speak', 'foreign', 'language', 'juicy', 'storyline', 'not', 'terrorist', 'plots', 'totally', 'most', 'moving', 'affectionate', 'episode', 'season', 'opinion', 'Yunjin', 'Kim', 'gave', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'airport', 'scene', 'was', 'pitch', 'perfect.2', 'Translation', 'great', 'companion', 'House', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'get', 'see', 'same', 'story', 'point', 'view', 'Jin', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'who', 'gave', 'really', 'great', 'performance', 'also', 'episode', 'where', 'island', 'drama', 'as', 'central', 'flashbacks3', 'Do', 'Harm', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'acted', 'scene', 'intensity', 'sincerity', 'subtlety', 'emotional', 'depth', 'really', 'mad', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'year', 'Emmy.4', 'Exodus', 'Part1', 'episode', 'story', 'along', 'poignant', 'episode', 'served', 'setup', 'great', 'episode', 'finale', 'major', 'storylines', 'past', 'were', 'untouched', 'reemerged.5', 'well', 'written', 'episode', 'gave', 'insights', 'answers', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'ask', 'mysterious', 'Locke', 'was', 'just', 'brilliant', 'how', 'puzzle', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'camera', 'close', 'ups', 'nuanced', 'reactions', 'movements', 'plane', 'crash', 'flashbackActually', 'personal', 'top', '5', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'justice', 'representing', 'very', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'are', 'other', 'standout', 'episodes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'been', 'list', 'Outlaws', 'White', 'Rabbit', 'Raised', 'Pilot', 'Exodus', 'Part', '2', '3', 'etc', '.Grade']",Lost - The Complete First Season

Hello, I'm The Curmudgeon, and for 50 reviews now I've been slating the baddest of the bad, the most laughable, awful drivel known to man. For (supposedly) five reviews though, I decided to write about things that I really liked. Then Amazon decided NOT to print one of them, meaning I had to replace it with something.  Then they decided to print it anyway. Leaving me with six instead of five. Hey-ho. Thank YOU, Amazon.Anyway, I'm from the UK so haven't actually SEEN all of this show yet. Now, I know some of you may be thinking ""what kind of knee-jerk reactionary dimwit puts something in his list of top things ever when he hasn't actually SEEN all of it yet?"" And you'd be right. That's why these public votes on ""The Best Albums Ever"" are so worthless, because The Scum merely put the last album they bought as the best ever - hence why you get Franz Ferdinand albums high up in those lists.But I'm not here just to talk about Lost itself. Awesome, awesome show as it is, full of great, fully fleshed characters with believable dialogue (if at first slightly mawkish.. ""count the fear away"", indeed) and some terrific pulse-pounding moments and a great ""gaaaaaah, don't end NOW"" sense of driven suspense.  What is really great about Lost is that it's a superb TV show that The Scum all get excited about as well.You know who The Scum are; the wretched, easily-pleased, watch whatever drivel is on, buy whatever's popular, wouldn't have a single original thought if their lives depended on it - yeah, you know what I mean - THEM. It's a show that THEY watch, and they don't even have to phone up and vote anyone off. There isn't a lame cover-version single released by ""their favourite"" at the end of it. It doesn't have desperate wannabes or even more desperate ""celebrities"" trying to claw their way into newspaper colum inches.In short - it's not reality television, the most hideous form of entertainment on the planet.And for that, we should be thankful. We should embrace Lost to our hearts and never let it go. This isn't some ""Cult"" show, it's not some God-awful sitcom a la Will And Grace - it's intelligent, thought-provoking drama that's got smart people, you and me, and thick people - The Scum, ALL watching.Now, here's the best part. TV execs might see that Lost is doing so well and think, ""hey, you know what? This Lost program is kicking ass in the ratings.. and look at the DVD sales. I might take this 10 million budget I have here and NOT comission another series of Pop Idol, but instead spend it developing ANOTHER cutting edge drama, with, you know, real actors and real scripts and.. what was that word again?

633126,A2M597GCCE1N2S,B00005JNOG,"the one and only ""david""","[3, 4]","Lost is the great new show of 40 surviving plane crash people who end up on a deserted island somwhere in the Pacific Ocean. After leaving Sydney, Austrailia the plane crashes and the men and women are left to defend for their own. Of the dozen or so main characters there includes:A young doctor by the name of Jack who came to Austrailia to find his father who disappeared only to find out he died and wants to bring his body back for burial.A young woman by the name of Kate who is shown as a criminal with a mysterious past of running from the law.A sarcastic ""Don't need help from anybody"" man with the name of Sawyer. He tends to stick to robbing the wreckage of the plane for money and jewels in case they survive.A construction worker by the name of Michale who wants to build a raft to take him and his small son Walt to safety.An obese, yet really funny, lottery winner by the name of Hurley, who seems to think that he is a jynx.A young Japanese couple that cant speak English [Well, at least one of them can't]A musician by the name of Charlie [You might recognize him from Lord of the Rings] who is addicted to drugs.A young woman by the name of Claire who is nine or so months pregnant.A young man and his spoiled step sister.A very interesting character by the name of Jon Locke who was a handicap yet regains the feeling in his legs and learns the secret of the Island.And last but not least an Iraq Republican Guard by the name of Sayid. [My favorite character]While there are about 30 other survivors, the show tends to stick to the main group, but there are several episodes that show more survivors in the main stories.Besides the flashback episodes that show each and everyone's trouble past with that character shining in their own ways, there are also numerous plots that take place:From the raft being built and vandalism occuring, to another woman of a different group of survivors who has been on the island for 16+ years, to even the main plot of having a huge monster that you can never see, roaming in the forests.We dont see what the monster looks like but we can certainly hear what it sounds like in several of the episodes. However the monster doesn't appear in all the episdoes, in fact, he actually disappears for several weeks worth of episodes and only untill the secret of the island is starting to come into the story does he make his return.There are also the big, big mysteries of a hatch found in the middle of the woods that is extremely hard to open, and also the mystery of a group of other people who are living in the woods and wants to kill the survivors. Both these two mysteries added to the suspense of the last episdoe, as the hatch was finally opened and the strange people finally showed up.The episodes are really powerful, and some are even more captivating than others. I find that the shows that revolve around Locke, Sayid, and Sawyer are the best ones, especially with Locke. This show was great, can't wait for the realease, and I definately reccomend you watch the second season.",5,"40 ""Lost"" survivors.....",1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,3041,"['Lost', 'great', 'new', 'show', '40', 'surviving', 'plane', 'crash', 'people', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'deserted', 'island', 'somwhere', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'leaving', 'Sydney', 'Austrailia', 'plane', 'crashes', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'left', 'defend', 'own', 'dozen', 'so', 'main', 'characters', 'young', 'doctor', 'name', 'Jack', 'who', 'came', 'Austrailia', 'find', 'father', 'who', 'disappeared', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'died', 'bring', 'body', 'back', 'burial.A', 'young', 'woman', 'name', 'Kate', 'who', 'shown', 'criminal', 'mysterious', 'past', 'running', 'law.A', 'sarcastic', 'Do', ""n't"", 'need', 'help', 'anybody', 'man', 'name', 'Sawyer', 'stick', 'robbing', 'wreckage', 'plane', 'money', 'jewels', 'case', 'survive.A', 'construction', 'worker', 'name', 'Michale', 'who', 'build', 'raft', 'take', 'small', 'son', 'Walt', 'safety.An', 'obese', 'yet', 'really', 'funny', 'lottery', 'winner', 'name', 'Hurley', 'who', 'think', 'jynx.A', 'young', 'Japanese', 'couple', 'cant', 'speak', 'English', '[', 'Well', 'least', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", ']', 'A', 'musician', 'name', 'Charlie', '[', 'might', 'recognize', 'Lord', 'Rings', ']', 'who', 'addicted', 'drugs.A', 'young', 'woman', 'name', 'Claire', 'who', 'nine', 'so', 'months', 'young', 'man', 'spoiled', 'step', 'sister.A', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'name', 'Jon', 'Locke', 'who', 'was', 'handicap', 'yet', 'feeling', 'legs', 'secret', 'Island.And', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Iraq', 'Republican', 'Guard', 'name', 'Sayid', '[', 'My', 'favorite', 'character', ']', 'are', '30', 'other', 'survivors', 'show', 'stick', 'main', 'group', 'are', 'several', 'episodes', 'show', 'more', 'survivors', 'main', 'flashback', 'show', 'everyone', 'trouble', 'past', 'character', 'shining', 'own', 'ways', 'are', 'also', 'numerous', 'plots', 'take', 'place', 'raft', 'being', 'built', 'vandalism', 'occuring', 'woman', 'different', 'group', 'survivors', 'who', 'been', 'island', '16+', 'years', 'even', 'main', 'plot', 'having', 'huge', 'monster', 'can', 'never', 'see', 'roaming', 'forests.We', 'dont', 'see', 'what', 'monster', 'can', 'certainly', 'hear', 'what', 'several', 'episodes', 'However', 'monster', ""n't"", 'appear', 'episdoes', 'fact', 'actually', 'several', 'weeks', 'worth', 'episodes', 'only', 'untill', 'secret', 'island', 'starting', 'come', 'story', 'make', 'return.There', 'are', 'also', 'big', 'big', 'mysteries', 'hatch', 'found', 'middle', 'woods', 'extremely', 'hard', 'open', 'also', 'mystery', 'group', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'woods', 'kill', 'survivors', 'two', 'mysteries', 'added', 'suspense', 'last', 'episdoe', 'hatch', 'was', 'finally', 'opened', 'strange', 'people', 'finally', 'showed', 'up.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'really', 'powerful', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'captivating', 'others', 'find', 'shows', 'revolve', 'Locke', 'Sayid', 'Sawyer', 'are', 'best', 'ones', 'especially', 'Locke', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'realease', 'definately', 'reccomend', 'watch', 'second', 'season']",Lost - The Complete First Season

I cannot imagine how tv fans are able to wait a whole week before seeing the next episode.  We watch 2 or 3 in one shot; many times going to bed very late.....This show is amazing.  I am familiar with J.J. Abrams work, as I was an avid fan of Felicity's and Alias grew on me after getting over the first 5 episodes which were really bad.  But Abrams seems to be growing better with experience.  Lost is a superior show to Alias.I will not go over the different aspects of the show, I think talking about events in the show spoils the element of surprise.But if you love high-quality, suspenseful, entertaining, amazing tv, then you must get LOST.I just have a request to the studios:  you should release the DVD series the day after the last episode in a season plays on tv.

633132,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JNOG,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 6]","Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) wanders around an isolated beach for a few minutes and then realizes other people need help. He rushes to a pregnant woman, Claire (Emilie de Ravin) who is being comforted by an overweight man, Hurley (Jorge Garcia). Soon, people realize they have survived a plane crash. They manage to move Claire right before an engine explodes. Eventually, the survivors learn that Jack is a doctor and they look to him for leadership and guidance. Jack is attracted to a mysterious woman, Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) seems to be unaffected by the crash, hoarding valuable items (aspirin, glasses, etc.), using them as currency. A father and son, Michael and Walt (Harold Perrineau and Malcolm David Kelley) are working on their strained relationship while trying to survive the island. Sayid (Naveen Andrews) is a sort of counterpart to Jack, providing expertise on electronics and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) seems to have all the survivalist instincts they will need to survive. A Korean couple (Daniel Dae Kim and Yoon-jin Kim) struggle to communicate with the English speaking survivors. Finally, Boone and Shannon (Ian Somerhalder and Maggie Grace), step-siblings, struggle to get along. As they learn some of the secrets of their new home, they also learn that each of the castaways have secrets. Which will prove the more dangerous?When I first heard the concept for ""Lost"" (the complete ""Season 1"" is available on DVD), I was intrigued. A dramatic ""Gilligan's Island""? A fictionalized ""Survivor""? I'm usually willing to give even the most far-fetched ideas a try. If they don't prove compelling, I tune out after one episode, but if they manage to lure me in, I'll stick around. ""Lost"" lured me in, but in my mind, I promised that the first time they tried to make a coconut radio, I was tuning out.What I didn't expect was the quality of ""Lost"". Fine, compelling performances married to good writing hooked me almost instantly. This is the type of show we have recently had to turn to HBO or Showtime for refuge. Granted, the characters never swear and nudity is non-existent, but network television has shied away from multi-episode storylines. On most dramas, everything has to happen in the space of 44 minutes. Next week, new story, new 44 minutes. (Yes, an hour long drama contains about 16 minutes of commercials.)  In ""Lost"", the characters still don't know everything about their new island home, and the second season is set to start in a few weeks.The first episode begins with the survivors on the beach. As they interact, fully realizing their situation, we see flashbacks to the moments on the passenger jet before it crashed. Each person was in a different area, so they all have different memories of what happened. What soon becomes apparent is that all of these survivors were in the same section of the plane. Where did the other sections of the plane end up? Where there any other survivors? In one episode, a married woman sits at the edge of the beach in shock. Jack walks over to comfort her. He learns that her husband was in the back of the plane. Jack tells her he is sure that he didn't suffer. ""Oh, he's not dead"". ""But there were no other survivors."" ""They probably think that about us as well.""Throughout the season, creators J.J. Abrams (""Alias""), Jeffrey Lieber and Damon Lindelof have peppered strange incidents into the storyline. The survivors have had a couple of run ins with a large beast only they have seen. They have also killed a polar bear. A polar bear on a desert island? And they found a French woman, the survivor of a shipwreck 16 years earlier, who keeps talking about ""them"".The bit about the people on the other parts of the airplane is ingenious. From a dramatic standpoint, it gives the show creators license to introduce new characters and new storylines. If things get a little stale with the core group of survivors, someone can walk dazedly out of the jungle and we'll accept it.From a production standpoint, the producers have done a brilliant thing. I'm sure many fans will disagree, but a core member of the group was killed off in season 1, providing a lot of drama. It also told the rest of the cast that they are not expendable. Yes, the story is set on a deserted island but we can introduce new people and we can kill off boring, stale characters. The producers sent a loud and clear message. ""We will not be held ransom by huge salary demands"", something that happens with almost every hit show.The strange incidents are compelling because they aren't consistent. One episode may have a brief encounter with the large beast, another may have Locke trying to unearth a metal hatch in the ground before returning to the main story. This works, because it keeps us guessing.Watching a show about a group of people on a desert island is interesting, but it can also become a bit stifling. Each episode tells basically two stories; the current events of the survivors on the island and a back-story involving one of the main characters, depicting the events leading up to them boarding the plane. For instance, if Jack is facing a weighty decision on the island, the story is intercut with one of the back stories involving his father. A back-story about Hurley winning the lottery proves to have a strange and unexpected connection to the survivors on the island. These back stories help to open up the show, taking us off of the island, maintaining our interest. Even more important, all of these back stories are connected to the main story, that of the survivors. It would be a completely different beast if the stories had no connection and nowhere near as compelling.""Lost"" is a fine example of what television can do when everything works. If you haven't already seen the first season, this is your chance to catch up. Don't get lost when the second season begins.",4,"Great, effective television",1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,5873,"['Jack', 'Shephard', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'wanders', 'isolated', 'beach', 'few',

633133,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00005JNOG,Tim Janson,"[9, 14]","To me, ""Lost"" is a watershed moment in TV history.  When I first saw the promos for the show back last season I wondered how the heck are they going to make a drama on people crashing on an island.  Gilligan's Island aside, this is not a screwball comedy nor is it the 1960's anymore.  I hazzard to say that TV audiences are more sophisticated today althouth shows like ""Fear Factor"" may belie that conjecture.  I'd not watched many dramas in recent years (not counting fantastic shows like Buffy & The X-files) as I grew weary of the ER-type dramas that go on and on with nothing ever really happening.Lost only goes to prove what can be done with talened writers, directors,and for the most part, no-name actors.  The realy trick behind Lost was giving us one major plot line and then branching that out in dozens of directions.  Suddenly by season's end you realized there was still so much more we did not know about the characters and the island itself.  The skillful blend of drama, mystery, action, fantasy, and romance is something never seen in televison. in my opinion.  The characters are, seemingly, just everyday people and react the way that the average person would in this situation.  They all have their own strenghts and weaknesses...and secrets.It's is these character which are as captivating as the main story itself.  The writers did a brilliant job by devoting an episode or two to each of the main chracters and fleshing out their backgroungs...not entirely...but just enough to make viewers want more.  We see Jack Shepard (Matthew Fox) as a surgeon who seems to have it all in life but is unhappy and searching for something more...Kate (Evangeline Lilly) the flight's mysterious prisoner and yes, killer...Sawyer (Josh Holloway) the cocky, sarcastic, greedy rogue whose on his own lifelong quest for revenge and absolution...Hurly (Jorge Garcia) the rotund, carefree lottery winner plagued by a nefarious spate of bad luck...And then there is John Locke.  Terry O'Quinn had been one of my favorite character actors for years..from his roles in ""The Stepfather"" to playing Howard Hughes in ""The Rocketeer"" to his stints in the X-Files and ""Millennium"", I have never seen this man give anything other than a brilliant performance and he is the key to this show.  His almost spiritual connection with nature and his miraculous recovery from paralyzation make him the most intriguing character in the show.  I've a feeling that we're going to learn much more about Locke and it may not all be good.I'd be remiss not to mention the character of Sayid (Naveen Andrews) playing a former Iraqi soldier.  I love the character but am curious why they chose and actor of Indian heritage rather than Arabic...The mysteries of the island abound...the lost aircraft and ships...the strange creatures and sounds, the french woman, the distress signals, etc...it's a dizzying array of plot-twits which the writers and directors have skillfully juggled.In this wasteland of brainless reality TV, ""Lost"" was like a beacon of light that brought viewers back to TV for a quality show.

All in all I thouroughly enjoyed Lost, and once a friend recommended me to watch the first episode, I became hooked.  There are many reasons to watch lost, the characters are interesting and thankfully dont follow usual racial stereotypes.  On good episodes the plot is gripping, unfortunately there a lot of episodes where the plot is a little slow though, and tend to focus more on the characters past.The character flashbacks are a good idea, and it helps to get a clear understanding of why certain people are like they are.  On certain episodes though (particularly in the middle of the series) it seemed as if they were just fleshing out the plot which wasn't 25 episodes in length.  However the series ended well and my faith has been restored, I can't wait for the Second series, which thankfully is starting in spring.  With very few secrets revealed at the end of the first series my only reservation is that Lost will continue indefinetely, and it may be years before we find out what the island really is.If the second series is just a little more action packed (which from clips i've seen it looks like it is) then it will be great TV, this series just narrowly misses out on a 5 star rating.  All the people knocking it because they saw the first 3 episodes etc... should have watched a bit more before making their judgement. Highly recommended.By the way in England weve been ripped off, they sold the first half of series 1 on DVD months ago, and now they are going to sell the second half seperately.  Buying them both is considerably more than it would be if it were in one set.

One of the most gripping shows on television, that has made it big on both sides of the Atlantic, this is the one show that every one should own. It seems that at the end of every show, no matter how well you think you may have sussed out what is going on, the fantastic writers on the show throw in a few twists and turns, to leave you completely. . . well lost. Which in my opinion is great. At the end of this season, I was happy to say that I really didn't know what would happen come series two, and I was just dying for more. The plot is no doubt a tad unrealistic, but this is the appeal of the programme- to be able to lose yourself for an hour in such a dramatic, yet, at times, humourous, adventure. Yet that really should be adventures, what with so many things going on from the mystery that surrounds THAT hatch to the daring exodus mission to the 'others'. Of course this kind of show couldn't be pulled off without characters that we come to love and the actors must be given a lot of credit for that. Along with the many mysteries of the island, we also get to explore the inhabitants' lives, which, to put it lightly, have been eventful. From the doctor, that becomes our unwilling hero, to the convict, and the millionaire to the confidence man, EVERYONE has secrets. This seven-disc is really worth its value, and after a rollercoaster twenty-five episode season, the extras are there to give a light-hearted view on the making of the show.

633153,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JNOG,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Before I begin my review of this show's actual content, let me make one thing perfectly clear: LOST is the greatest sci-fi/drama show I have ever watched.  Now, this is saying something, as I am also a huge fan of Star Trek and The X-Files.  From the first episode, however, LOST hooked me in with its mysterious plots, emotional drama, and flash-back storytelling method.In a nutshell, LOST tells the story of a group of people who survived a plane crash and now find themselves on a deserted island, with little chance for rescue.  Yet, this show is NOT a dramatic version of Survivor.  Producer J.J. Abrams makes this clear right from the get-go, as on the first night on the island a dinosaur-sounding monster invades the group's camp and adds a mysteriousness to the entire situation.  From there, the survivors come into contact with a polar bear, a French woman who has been broadcasting an SOS on the island for many years, and a metal hatch buried deep in the ground.  Obviously, the island is not as ""innocent"" as it would seem.Besides the X-Files-like plot twists (but LOST actually executes its plot better than the X-Files because it always follows up on all key plot elements), the stories of a selected group of the plane crash survivors add the emotional drama to the show.  By flashing-back to their lives before the clash, it is revealed how certain characters wound up on the plane to begin with.  Also, the undercurrent beneath every flash-back implies that each ""Lostie"" is somehow connected to each other, and perhaps they are even ""brought"" to their mysterious island for a particular reason.  I would go into more details about some of the survivors' flashbacks, but too many spoilers would abound if I did.  Suffice it to say that you WILL be emotionally ""hooked"" by each and every one of their stories, and your emotion will be compounded by the surprise endings (almost Twilight Zone-esque) of most of the flashbacks.To conclude, LOST is the perfect blend of emotional drama, intense action, and mind-bending mystery.  This first season primarily serves to introduce the important characters (through the ingenious flash-back method) and scratch the surface of the mysteries the island has to offer.  If you purchase this produce, I recommend buying the second season right now as well, as you WILL NOT want to wait after this season's cliffhanger ending.",5,Introducing The Characters,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,2382,"['begin', 'review', 'show', 'actual', 'content', 'let', 'make', 'one', 'thing', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'LOST', 'greatest', 'sci-fi/drama', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'Now', 'saying', 'something', 'am', 'also', 'huge', 'fan', 'Star', 'Trek', 'X-Files', 'first', 'episode', 'however', 'LOST', 'hooked', 'mysterious', 'plots', 'emotional', 'drama', 'flash-back', 'storytelling', 'method.In', 'nutshell', 'LOST', 'story', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'survived', 'plane', 'crash', 'now', 'find', 'deserted', 'island', 'little', 'chance', 'rescue', 'show', 'NOT', 'dramatic', 'version', 'Survivor', 'Producer', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'clear', 'right', 'get-go', 'first', 'night', 'island', 'dinosaur-sounding', 'monster', 'group', 'camp', 'mysteriousness', 'entire', 'situation', 'there', 'survivors', 'come', 'contact', 'polar', 'bear', 'French', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'broadcasting', 'SOS', 'island', 'many', 'years', 'metal', 'hatch', 'buried', 'deep', 'ground', 'Obviously', 'island', 'not', 'innocent', 'would', 'seem.Besides', 'X-Files-like', 'plot', 'twists', 'LOST', 'actually', 'plot', 'better', 'X-Files', 'always', 'up', 'key', 'plot', 'elements', 'stories', 'selected', 'group', 'plane', 'crash', 'survivors', 'add', 'emotional', 'drama', 'show', 'flashing-back', 'lives', 'clash', 'revealed', 'how', 'certain', 'characters', 'wound', 'up', 'plane', 'begin', 'Also', 'undercurrent', 'beneath', 'flash-back', 'implies', 'Lostie', 'somehow', 'connected', 'other', 'perhaps', 'are', 'even', 'brought', 'mysterious', 'island', 'particular', 'reason', 'would', 'go', 'more', 'details', 'survivors', 'flashbacks', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'would', 'abound', 'did', 'Suffice', 'say', 'WILL', 'be', 'emotionally', 'hooked', 'one', 'stories', 'emotion', 'will', 'be', 'compounded', 'surprise', 'endings', 'almost', 'Twilight', 'Zone-esque', 'most', 'flashbacks.To', 'conclude', 'LOST', 'perfect', 'blend', 'emotional', 'drama', 'intense', 'action', 'mind-bending', 'mystery', 'first', 'season', 'primarily', 'introduce', 'important', 'characters', 'ingenious', 'flash-back', 'method', 'scratch', 'surface', 'mysteries', 'island', 'offer', 'purchase', 'produce', 'recommend', 'buying', 'second', 'season', 'right', 'now', 'as', 'well', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'want', 'wait', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'ending']",Lost - The Complete First Season
