But, if you are even generally familiar with the battle, this a hugely disappointing account. For starters, it begs for maps showing the course of the battle. There is absolutely no visual or spatial context for what is being portrayed in the battle scenes. The account is completely lacking structure and cohesion that maps would have provided. This would have been very simple and inexpensive to achieve. Yes, there was one overall map but it really was inadequate to explain what was going on. Second, the really cheesy actors portraying the key historical figures, their silly looking makeup and their complete lack of trained voices for the narration just made them comical. Finally, the re-enactors were, as re-enactors usually are, too old and many of them too fat to have any credibility. Ken Burns did a much better job portraying Antietam in ""The Civil War"" without actors or re-enactors and using professionals to speak the words being quoted and that really is the gold standard. This effort doesn't even come close. Short version: Needs more maps, a more defined story arc, better actors and lose the re-enactors.",2,Hugely Disappointing,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,1202,"['Maybe', 'good', 'introduction', 'viewers', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'Antietam', 'are', 'even', 'generally', 'familiar', 'battle', 'hugely', 'disappointing', 'account', 'starters', 'maps', 'showing', 'course', 'battle', 'absolutely', 'visual', 'spatial', 'context', 'what', 'being', 'portrayed', 'battle', 'scenes', 'account', 'completely', 'lacking', 'structure', 'cohesion', 'maps', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'simple', 'inexpensive', 'achieve', 'Yes', 'was', 'one', 'overall', 'map', 'really', 'was', 'inadequate', 'explain', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Second', 'really', 'cheesy', 'actors', 'portraying', 'key', 'historical', 'figures', 'silly', 'looking', 'makeup', 'complete', 'lack', 'trained', 'voices', 'narration', 'just', 'made', 'comical', 'Finally', 're-enactors', 'were', 're-enactors', 'usually', 'are', 'too', 'old', 'many', 'too', 'fat', 'have', 'credibility', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'portraying', 'Antietam', 'Civil', 'War', 'actors', 're-enactors', 'using', 'professionals', 'speak', 'words', 'being', 'quoted', 'really', 'gold', 'standard', 'effort', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Short', 'version', 'more', 'maps', 'more', 'defined', 'story', 'arc', 'better', 'actors', 'lose', 're-enactors']",N/A
