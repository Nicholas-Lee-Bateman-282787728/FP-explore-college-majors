846151,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B0002V7TVK,Ernest Jagger,"[15, 15]","""Oasis,"" is a very poignant film from director Lee Chang-dong. The film gives powerful acting performances by the female lead Gong-ju (Moon So-ri) and her counterpart, the male Jong-du (Sol Kyung-gu) which are both masterful. As the films narrative begins, Jong-du (Sol Kyung-gu) has been released from prison. Jong-du is a sociopath who is unable to hold a job and has been in prison three times: for attempted rape, drunkeness which caused an accident, and armed robbery. He decides to visit the family of the man who was killed by his brother. He took the rap for his brother in the accident which sent him to jail. However, the family is moving out when he arrives, leaving a seriously disabled woman [the husbands disabled sister] behind.The woman is named Gong-ju (Moon So-ri). Moreover, Jong-du finds himself attracted to this woman, who can barely control her body: She has cerebral palsy. When he returns at a later date, however, a very disturbing event occurs [No spoilers: I will leave this for you to view]. However, even though this event by Jong-du is disturbing, Gong-du invites him back again. It is here that these two outcasts of society begin to develop a friendship. Yet, this relationship causes a problem with both of the families, as they do not want any scandal. The families and society have come to see their relationship as twisted and abnormal.The film shows the happiness of these two unwanted members of society, yet it also shows [not tells] the unease of the two families who are now caught up in the lives of these two individuals. On one side is a man who is emotionally unstable, and the other, a woman who must deal with the harsh realities of cerebral palsy: where her life is one of isolation. Director Lee Chang-dong gives a very insightful film about two people who are socially shunned by the society they live in. And yet, the director allows the viewer to see that they are both content to be with each other, and to hell with society and its mores. These two people both appreciate being alive, and have found each other. This is a drama, and as such, may not appeal to those who are into action films. However, I liked it.

846153,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0002V7TVK,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[6, 6]","I must say the grace and beauty of this film left me speechless with its powerful portrayal of two outcast Koreans. One, a young man with multiple incarcerations and nowhere to belong, is wondrously portrayed by Sol Kyung-Gu, while the other performance is, in my estimation, perhaps the finest performance anywhere of 2002. So-ri Moon portrays a young lady with cerebral palsy who is basically abandoned by her family and left to fend for herself much of the time, except when they can manipulate the system for her subsidized apartment.Moon's portrayal is so completely absorbing that it is impossible to not draw comparison to Daniel Day-Lewis in ""My Left Foot."" It is, without a doubt, one of the best portrayals of an adult with a disability in cinema. Moon captures the physicalization of her character so completely, so accurately that it is often painful and tiring to watch her. This, in some ways, is a ""stick with it film."" The first few minutes are quite challenging to watch as the viewers is forced to adjust to the constant spastic behavior, the difficult speech and the aberrant behavior of her soon to be beau.A lot of viewers will cringe early on as the young woman is faced with a near rape by the man who grows to care about her, accept her and ultimately love her beyond what most would ever recognize as love. Watching the scene where he begins to assault her, then suddenly and rather horrifyingly recognizes his behavior is one of the most painful scenes I've ever seen in a film. The pain of both perpetrator and victim is pushed to the forefront and, in essence, becomes one. As the two become closer, the film deals powerfully with the taboos of society...the alleged impossibility of loving a person with a disability...of being sexual with a person with a disability. It is horrifying to watch the young woman's family...who had been so negligent and so abusive to her suddenly ""care"" about her now that she was being loved for the very first time AND able to love freely for the very first time.The filmmaker made so many wise choices here...including the inter-mixing of scenes of Moon fantasizing about having a normal body and doing normal things and enjoying a normal day. These fantasies gave us a glimpse of Moon without disabilities...without a twitch or spasm or speech difficulty. While this may sound a tad judgmental, this ""break"" allows the audience to breathe and to fully appreciate the challenges that the character faces. Both sides are presented. In many ways, this is such a sad film...because there is so much truth within it. Every aspect of this production is outstanding from the performances to the cinematography. Before I end this I have to say Thanks Woopak on advising me towards this. ""Oasis"" is, indeed, a film of power and beauty, grace, and wisdom. It is, in my eyes, a ""must see"" foreign film.",4,This movie will accept you for who your are...,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,2855,"['must', 'say', 'grace', 'beauty', 'film', 'left', 'speechless', 'powerful', 'portrayal', 'two', 'outcast', 'Koreans', 'One', 'young', 'man', 'multiple', 'incarcerations', 'nowhere', 'belong', 'wondrously', 'portrayed', 'Sol', 'Kyung-Gu', 'other', 'performance', 'estimation', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'performance', 'anywhere', '2002', 'So-ri', 'Moon', 'young', 'lady', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'who', 'basically', 'abandoned', 'family', 'left', 'fend', 'much', 'time', 'when', 'can', 'manipulate', 'system', 'subsidized', 'apartment.Moon', 'portrayal', 'so', 'completely', 'absorbing', 'impossible', 'not', 'draw', 'comparison', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Left', 'Foot', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'portrayals', 'adult', 'disability', 'cinema', 'Moon', 'physicalization', 'character', 'so', 'completely', 'so', 'accurately', 'often', 'painful', 'tiring', 'watch', 'ways', 'stick', 'film', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'are', 'quite', 'challenging', 'watch', 'viewers', 'forced', 'adjust', 'constant', 'spastic', 'behavior', 'difficult', 'speech', 'aberrant', 'behavior', 'soon', 'be', 'beau.A', 'lot', 'viewers', 'will', 'cringe', 'early', 'young', 'woman', 'faced', 'near', 'rape', 'man', 'who', 'care', 'accept', 'ultimately', 'love', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'ever', 'recognize', 'love', 'Watching', 'scene', 'where', 'assault', 'then', 'suddenly', 'rather', 'horrifyingly', 'recognizes', 'behavior', 'one', 'most', 'painful', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'pain', 'perpetrator', 'victim', 'pushed', 'forefront', 'essence', 'one', 'two', 'become', 'closer', 'film', 'deals', 'powerfully', 'taboos', 'society', 'alleged', 'impossibility', 'loving', 'person', 'disability', 'being', 'sexual', 'person', 'disability', 'horrifying', 'watch', 'young', 'woman', 'family', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'negligent', 'so', 'abusive', 'suddenly', 'care', 'now', 'was', 'being', 'loved', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'able', 'love', 'freely', 'very', 'first', 'time.The', 'filmmaker', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'wise', 'choices', 'here', 'including', 'inter-mixing', 'scenes', 'Moon', 'fantasizing', 'about', 'having', 'normal', 'body', 'doing', 'normal', 'things', 'enjoying', 'normal', 'day', 'fantasies', 'gave', 'glimpse', 'Moon', 'disabilities', 'twitch', 'spasm', 'speech', 'difficulty', 'may', 'sound', 'tad', 'judgmental', 'break', 'audience', 'breathe', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'challenges', 'character', 'sides', 'are', 'presented', 'many', 'ways', 'such', 'sad', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'truth', 'Every', 'aspect', 'production', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'Thanks', 'Woopak', 'advising', 'Oasis', 'indeed', 'film', 'power', 'beauty', 'grace', 'wisdom', 'eyes', 'must', 'see', 'foreign', 'film']",N/A

Director Chang-Dong Lee utilizes a similar tragedy in his Oasis where he enlightens the viewers of a much more contemporary issue where the two protagonists find themselves rejected by their own families.  However, it is within the tragedy that humanity is given an opportunity to grow and show that love does reach beyond vanity and self-importance.The opening shot displays an embroidered depiction of something resembling an oasis emerging from underneath the shadows of the night, as a tree outside throws its nightmarish shadow over the the embroidery.  The camera finally reveals a small oasis in the middle of a desert with a Indian woman, a boy, and an elephant.  This initial sequence continues for almost two minutes.  A time that might seem like an eternity for introducing the title of the film.  However, these two minutes will also bring to mind a different notion, which will disclose itself at a later point in the film.  In addition, the film will return to this embroidery, as it represents the main motif of the film both literally and symbolically.The film begins with Hong Jong-Du (Kyung-gu Sol) returning home on a bus with summer clothing in the middle of a freezing winter.  Initially, Jong-Du's light clothing might imply that there is something wrong with him, and yes, there is something wrong with him.  However, it is not his summer wear, but his social interaction with people that seems strange on a communicational level.  He wanders home to find out that his family have moved without informing him about their whereabouts.  Alone, Jong-Du drifts until hunger sets in and he gets in trouble with the law, which obviously is not the first time when it is revealed that he has just been released from prison.  Fortunately, one of Jong-Du's brothers bails him out and brings him home, but it is not a dear homecoming for Jong-Du.Every second of the film displays additional problems that Jong-Du has, and it is evident that Jong-Du suffers from some cognitive disorder.  In an awkward and unwelcome visit of Jong-Du with the family whose father he accidentally killed in a car accident he meets Han Gong-Ju (Moon So-ri), the daughter of the deceased father.  Gong-Ju suffers from cerebral palsy and is more or less stranded in her fathers old apartment, as her brother has found it convenient to leave her in the hands of her neighbor.During the second visit to Gong-Ju, Jong-du breaks into her apartment out of curiosity.  He talks with her and expresses his affection for her while leaving her his brother's business card with a phone number where she can reach him.  Consequently, Jong-Du begins to express his desires for her by sexually assaulting her.  It is with much difficulty one has to watch this dreadful scene, but it also further displays Jong-Du's inability to function on a normal level.  She passes out while Jong-Du panics and runs away after having gotten her back to consciousness.  From out of the blue Jong-Du receives a phone call.  It is Gong-Ju who calls him and she wants to meet.  This brings them through an unusual, yet tender love affair with respect, care, and affection where the embroidery on the wall comes into play.The performances by Kyung-gu Sol and Moon So-ri are astounding, as they help elevate the film to the heartrending experience that it provides.  This is the second time these two actors have worked together, as they both were in the terrific Peppermint Candy (2000).  Here in Oasis they seem very comfortable with one another and this is essential for them to be able to pull off such terrific performances.  Both give very different visualizations of their characters and they do so convincingly well.Chang-Dong Lee depicts a loving tale through some amazing scenes where he breaks the boundaries between what is real and fantasy.  It is in these fantasy scenes where the audience will find themselves bewildered to what is truly happening, but it must be magical happiness that is being expressed.  The camera also reveals some stunning realism where the interaction between Gong-Ju and Jong-Du displays both their difficulties and how they cope with their difficulties in society.  Through the combination of fantasy and realism Chang-Dong Lee expresses a genuine concern about the issue at hand, which suggests that all people have the right to love and feel loved.",5,A Very Different and Poignant Love Story...,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,4491,"['Even', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'love', 'being', 'brought', 'audience', 'agonizing', 'tragedy', 'where', 'two', 'families', 'disagree', 'love', 'Director', 'Chang-Dong', 'Lee', 'similar', 'tragedy', 'Oasis', 'where', 'viewers', 'much', 'more', 'contemporary', 'issue', 'where', 'two', 'protagonists', 'find', 'rejected', 'own', 'families', 'However', 'tragedy', 'humanity', 'given', 'opportunity', 'grow', 'show', 'love', 'reach', 'vanity', 'self-importance.The', 'opening', 'shot', 'embroidered', 'depiction', 'something', 'resembling', 'oasis', 'emerging', 'shadows', 'night', 'tree', 'outside', 'nightmarish', 'shadow', 'embroidery', 'camera', 'finally', 'small', 'oasis', 'middle', 'desert', 'Indian', 'woman', 'boy', 'elephant', 'initial', 'sequence', 'almost', 'two', 'minutes', 'time', 'might', 'seem', 'eternity', 'introducing', 'title', 'film', 'However', 'two', 'minutes', 'will', 'also', 'bring', 'mind', 'different', 'notion', 'will', 'disclose', 'later', 'point', 'film', 'addition', 'film', 'will', 'return', 'embroidery', 'main', 'motif', 'film', 'literally', 'symbolically.The', 'film', 'begins', 'Hong', 'Jong-Du', 'Kyung-gu', 'Sol', 'returning', 'home', 'bus', 'summer', 'clothing', 'middle', 'freezing', 'winter', 'Initially', 'Jong-Du', 'light', 'clothing', 'might', 'imply', 'something', 'wrong', 'yes', 'something', 'wrong', 'However', 'not', 'summer', 'wear', 'social', 'interaction', 'people', 'strange', 'communicational', 'level', 'home', 'find', 'out', 'family', 'have', 'moved', 'informing', 'whereabouts', 'Alone', 'Jong-Du', 'drifts', 'hunger', 'sets', 'trouble', 'law', 'obviously', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'revealed', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'Fortunately', 'one', 'Jong-Du', 'brothers', 'bails', 'out', 'home', 'not', 'dear', 'homecoming', 'Jong-Du.Every', 'second', 'film', 'additional', 'problems', 'Jong-Du', 'evident', 'Jong-Du', 'suffers', 'cognitive', 'disorder', 'awkward', 'unwelcome', 'visit', 'Jong-Du', 'family', 'father', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'Han', 'Gong-Ju', 'Moon', 'So-ri', 'daughter', 'deceased', 'father', 'Gong-Ju', 'suffers', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'more', 'less', 'stranded', 'fathers', 'old', 'apartment', 'brother', 'found', 'convenient', 'leave', 'hands', 'neighbor.During', 'second', 'visit', 'Gong-Ju', 'Jong-du', 'apartment', 'curiosity', 'affection', 'while', 'leaving', 'brother', 'business', 'card', 'phone', 'number', 'where', 'can', 'reach', 'Consequently', 'Jong-Du', 'begins', 'express', 'desires', 'sexually', 'assaulting', 'much', 'difficulty', 'one', 'watch', 'dreadful', 'scene', 'also', 'further', 'Jong-Du', 'inability', 'function', 'normal', 'level', 'out', 'Jong-Du', 'panics', 'away', 'having', 'gotten', 'back', 'consciousness', 'blue', 'Jong-Du', 'phone', 'call', 'Gong-Ju', 'who', 'meet', 'unusual', 'yet', 'tender', 'love', 'affair', 'respect', 'care', 'affection', 'where', 'embroidery', 'wall', 'play.The', 'performances', 'Kyung-gu', 'Sol', 'Moon', 'So-ri', 'are', 'astounding', 'help', 'elevate', 'film', 'heartrending', 'experience', 'second', 'time', 'two', 'actors', 'have', 'worked', 'together', 'were', 'terrific', 'Peppermint', 'Candy', '2000', 'Here', 'Oasis', 'seem', 'very', 'comfortable', 'one', 'essential', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'such', 'terrific', 'performances', 'give', 'very', 'different', 'visualizations', 'characters', 'do', 'so', 'convincingly', 'well.Chang-Dong', 'Lee', 'loving', 'tale', 'amazing', 'scenes', 'where', 'boundaries', 'what', 'real', 'fantasy', 'fantasy', 'scenes', 'where', 'audience', 'will', 'find', 'bewildered', 'what', 'truly', 'happening', 'must', 'be', 'magical', 'happiness', 'being', 'expressed', 'camera', 'also', 'stunning', 'realism', 'where', 'interaction', 'Gong-Ju', 'Jong-Du', 'displays', 'difficulties', 'how', 'cope', 'difficulties', 'society', 'combination', 'fantasy', 'realism', 'Chang-Dong', 'Lee', 'genuine', 'concern', 'issue', 'hand', 'people', 'have', 'right', 'love', 'feel', 'loved']",N/A

However, the acting of the girl with CP was so PERFECT that I was convinced she actually had CP and I do hope she won a well deserved award. If not familiar with the handicapped, then this film should bring to light that they are just like us with normal needs and feelings, and just because they may not be able to communicate effectively (although those that work with them professionally, or, those that really &#34;care&#34; usually know exactly what they're attempting to communicate), does not mean they should be taken advantage of as the young girl was obviously neglected by those who were pretending to take care of her and fend care because they thought she couldn't say anything about it. Usually those with CP are NOT mentally retarded, they are just locked in a spastic body, in this case anyways, she was VERY aware of everything. I really believe they serve as karmic subjects for those that are in their presence and for society in general and they are often high souls that take on that role.

846158,A17KCWWEHBJCJX,B0002V7TVK,neon rebel,"[37, 41]","This is one of the toughest and most uncompromising love stories ever told, with the precision of a surgeon and brutality of a neutron bomb. It will be among my favorites at the end of the year.It's the story of two mentally disabled, both of ignored and unwanted by their families and society, finding love and solace in each other. I would say more except it might ruin the experience for you, so you will have to take my word that it's great.The story never becomes melodramatic like most Korean productions, nor does it glorify their disablements as a badge of innocence like so many Hollywood films (as Gump did). The film treats its subjects fairly without embellishment, and sheds light on the process of unwarranted societal prejudices. You might not like how the romance ends, but it is frustratingly real.Both of the acting talents, re-united again from director's previous film Peppermint Candy, are truly impressive. Sol Kyung-gu gave his character more depth and layer than you would expect, and Moon So-ri is even more mesmerizing as the girl afflicted with CP. In several sequences, she has to transform into her imagined self right on screen without the aid of any effects, so her limbs and face return to their natural uncontorted state instantly, and for a few minutes we see her as the normal girl her mind projects. Those lyrical and fantastic moments are so simple and effectively touching that it's the very definition of cinema magic.It makes almost all Hollywood romances (especially those with Meg Ryan) seem trite and insulting in comparison, and after this experience I can never sit through another one of those again. Oasis is one of the best, most unique, and most unsentimental romances ever filmed, and will remain one of the best kept secrets of cinema unless you dare to venture into the scary but wonderful world of foreign films.",5,An unexpected and magical romance.,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,1865,"['one', 'toughest', 'most', 'uncompromising', 'love', 'stories', 'ever', 'told', 'precision', 'surgeon', 'brutality', 'neutron', 'bomb', 'will', 'be', 'favorites', 'end', 'year.It', 'story', 'two', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'ignored', 'unwanted', 'families', 'society', 'finding', 'love', 'solace', 'other', 'would', 'say', 'more', 'might', 'ruin', 'experience', 'will', 'have', 'take', 'word', 'great.The', 'story', 'never', 'melodramatic', 'most', 'Korean', 'productions', 'glorify', 'disablements', 'badge', 'innocence', 'so', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'Gump', 'did', 'film', 'subjects', 'fairly', 'embellishment', 'sheds', 'light', 'process', 'unwarranted', 'societal', 'prejudices', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'how', 'romance', 'frustratingly', 'real.Both', 'acting', 'talents', 're-united', 'again', 'director', 'previous', 'film', 'Peppermint', 'Candy', 'are', 'truly', 'impressive', 'Sol', 'Kyung-gu', 'gave', 'character', 'more', 'depth', 'layer', 'would', 'expect', 'Moon', 'So-ri', 'even', 'more', 'mesmerizing', 'girl', 'afflicted', 'CP', 'several', 'sequences', 'transform', 'imagined', 'self', 'right', 'screen', 'aid', 'effects', 'limbs', 'face', 'return', 'natural', 'uncontorted', 'state', 'instantly', 'few', 'minutes', 'see', 'normal', 'girl', 'mind', 'projects', 'lyrical', 'fantastic', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'simple', 'effectively', 'touching', 'very', 'definition', 'cinema', 'magic.It', 'almost', 'Hollywood', 'romances', 'especially', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'seem', 'trite', 'insulting', 'comparison', 'experience', 'can', 'never', 'sit', 'one', 'again', 'Oasis', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'unique', 'most', 'unsentimental', 'romances', 'ever', 'filmed', 'will', 'remain', 'one', 'best', 'kept', 'secrets', 'cinema', 'dare', 'venture', 'scary', 'wonderful', 'world', 'foreign', 'films']",N/A

846160,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0002V7TVK,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[8, 8]","OASIS is a very real tale of life directed by Chang-Dong Lee. I've heard someone saying before that filming comedy is hard; a genuine melodrama is almost impossible. Well, ""Oasis"" is a film of raw emotion; happiness and laughter, sadness and tears. When and if all the right factors come together in the same movie, we see an accomplishment that truly is alive, that the proceedings seem to have a life all it's own and the plot truly breathes.Jong-Du is a young man who is almost at the end of his rope, he has made a lot of bad choices and lives his life without a care. He has just gotten out of prison to serve a sentence of vehicular manslaughter, his family and friends greet him with somewhat a lukewarm reception. Jong-Du finds it very difficult to re-adjust to common life and for some reason, he seeks out the family of the man killed in the car accident; mostly for the purpose of amusing himself and partly to apologize. When he arrives, he finds Gong-Ju (Moon So-ri), the man's cerebral palsy inflicted daughter who spends most of her days in a tiny apartment fantasizing in her own dreamworld. The two misfits of society begin to form a bond that is both impressive, touching and disturbing.The film's title is very fitting. ""Oasis"" signifies a world wherein a person or couple can have a place all their own without care or consequences of modern society. Jong-Du (Kyung-Gu Sol) is a young man who is seen as lacking in common sense and smarts to make the right choices for himself. He tries to just ""make"" do with his life but for some reason, anything he does goes blowing up on his face. Gong-ju (So-ri Moon) is a young woman, who is suffering from a crippling ailment that keeps her from articulating properly, her muscles shake without her accord. We see two people searching for something that is missing from their lives. By themselves, they are nothing but bits and pieces but together they become complete.The film's main strengths come from the lead characters' performances, which is just unbelievable. So-ri Moon won numerous awards for her performance that outshines ANYTHING I've seen before. Her physical performance filled me with awe; as she contorts her own body to express the pain the disease has inflicted upon her. Moon successfully twists to the sharp, stiff movements (much like a contortionist would) of her limbs which is almost weird, since the gestures really look like they're not her own volition. Of course, Kyung-Gu Sol's (Public Enemy) performance is also worth mentioning. He successfully portrays the role of a simpleton with such depth and tremendous odd charisma. His is not a simple idiot, but rather one with layers upon layers of character; with each underlying layer that adds more depth to his portrayal.Every great story has its complications. Without any opposition then the couple will just play around their fantasy world and the emotional impact of the film will not achieve its potential. Both sides of their respective families beset the couple. Jong-du's brethren sees Gong-ju as a woman who is handicapped and should be left alone; they see her as another bad mistake. Gong-ju's family sees Jong-du as the murderer of her father. There was a very moving scene where Jong-du took Gong-ju to his family's party in a restaurant. The couple had to bear all the humiliating stares and whispers by the patrons of a public place. Despite all odds, the couple decides to continue seeing each other despite their families' wishes, which will ultimately test the strength of love they feel for one another.I was very moved and at the same time disgusted with the family of each side, since they have their own motivations for keeping the two apart. There is a nice almost unexpected twist regarding the car accident, I really found myself repelled that one's family (Gong-ju's) will use her handicap as an advantage to cheat and for financial advantages, at the same time ashamed of her and mostly neglects her needs. I understand that the families have their own concerns about the views of society. I think the film's premise is so deep that it goes further than your standard ""Romeo and Juliet"" with two lovers in an ""against all odds"" predicament.I found ""Oasis"" a very difficult film to review. It is very different from all the love stories that have been told through the years. Whether it is because of the ""taboos"" involving the handicapped, or maybe because of the fact that reproducing these two VERY unique characters and their TRULY odd relationship are almost unachievable. The film truly pushes the envelope with its pessimistic portrayal of society. It pushes the limits of film-making, and makes one ponder a single honest question; ""How far would you go to love someone? How do you know if what you have is something real or just a product of necessity?""The film truly challenges the very definition of LOVE that it will test our hearts and minds.VIDEO/AUDIO: 1.78 ratio Anamorphic Widescreen. The transfer is pretty simple for the U.S. release (I rented this film first). The picture is lacking in contrast and has an inky color palette. I thought this was done on purpose until I bought the region-3 release from CJ Entertainment, which was flawless in picture and audio quality. If you're able to play import dvds, get the original Korean release that carries spectacular PQ and DTS sound. English Subtitles are excellent.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!

When I came across this movie in my local library, I wasn't sure what to expect, but when I read the short synopsis on the back of the DVD cover, I knew I had to check it out, and I am so glad I did.This is such a tender yet gut-wrenching movie about two people who are marginalized by their families and society. Sol Kyung-Gu plays Jong-Du who seems to be a social outcast and who has recently been released from prison for involuntary manslaughter. He also seems almost child-like and may be be a bit 'slow'. His family treats him like something the dog dragged in and he doesn't seem to feel comfortable in social settings. A chance meeting [he goes to visit the family of the man he 'killed'] results in his meeting Han Gong-Ju [Moon So-ri], an intelligent young woman who is trapped within a body ravaged by advanced cerebral palsy. Gong-Ju's family have literally abandoned her, leaving her alone in a derelict apartment with no one to care for her, except a neighbor who is paid a measly sum to casually watch her. When Jong-Du first comes to visit her after she is abandoned, the meeting ends in disaster, but these two tormented souls eventually find solace and love in each other, and finally feel hope engulfing their miserable existence. However, their respective families and society at large frown upon their relationship, which mars the couple's happiness.This is a depressing movie - it depicts the brutal and cruel treatment that special needs people are subjected to in society, and makes for a disturbing viewing experience. The bright spots in the movie are parts where we witness the intimate connection between two 'forgotten' souls who find a deep emotional connection with each other.
